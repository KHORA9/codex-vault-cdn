Nearly one half the people of the five New\r\nEngland States supported the war, but were paralyzed by the other half,\r\nwhich opposed it. Of the peace party, one half wished to stop the war,\r\nbut was paralyzed by the other half, which threatened to desert their\r\nleaders at the first overt act of treason. In this dead-lock every one\r\nwas dissatisfied, but no one seemed disposed to yield.\r\n\r\nSuch a situation could not last. In times of revolution treason might\r\nbe necessary, but inert perversity could at no time serve a useful\r\npurpose. Yet the Massachusetts Federalists professed only a wish to\r\nremain inert. Josiah Quincy, who fretted at restraints, and whose\r\ninstincts obliged him to act as energetically as he talked, committed\r\nhis party to the broad assertion that “a moral and religious people”\r\ncould not express admiration for heroism displayed in a cause they\r\ndisapproved. They would defend Massachusetts only by waiting to be\r\ninvaded; and if their safety depended on their possessing the outlet\r\nof Lake Champlain, they would refuse to seize it if in doing so\r\nthey should be obliged to cross the Canadian line. With one accord\r\nMassachusetts Federalists reiterated that until their territory should\r\nbe actually invaded, they would not take arms. After January 1, 1814,\r\nwhen news of the battle of Leipzig arrived, the dreaded invasion of New\r\nEngland became imminent; but the Federalists, officially and privately,\r\ninsisted on their doctrine of self-defence.\r\n\r\n   “In the tumult of arms,” said Governor Strong in his speech to\r\n   the legislature, January 12, 1814, “the passions of men are\r\n   easily inflamed by artful misrepresentations; they are apt to\r\n   lose sight of the origin of a contest, and to forget, either\r\n   in the triumph of victory or the mortification of defeat, that\r\n   the whole weight of guilt and wretchedness occasioned by war is\r\n   chargeable upon that government which unreasonably begins the\r\n   conflict, and upon those of its subjects who, voluntarily and\r\n   without legal obligation, encourage and support it.”\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Senate echoed the sentiment in language more\r\nemphatic:--\r\n\r\n   “Beyond that submission which laws enacted agreeably to the\r\n   Constitution make necessary, and that self-defence which the\r\n   obligation to repel hostile invasions justifies, a people can\r\n   give no encouragement to a war of such a character without\r\n   becoming partakers in its guilt, and rendering themselves\r\n   obnoxious to those just retributions of Divine vengeance by\r\n   which, sooner or later, the authors and abettors of such a war\r\n   will be assuredly overtaken.”\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives could see but one contingency that\r\nwarranted Massachusetts in making voluntary exertion:--\r\n\r\n   “It is only after the failure of an attempt to negotiate,\r\n   prosecuted with evidence of these dispositions on the part of\r\n   our Administration, that any voluntary support of this unhappy\r\n   war can be expected from our constituents.”\r\n\r\nIn thus tempting blows from both sides, Massachusetts could hardly fail\r\nto suffer more than by choosing either alternative. Had she declared\r\nindependence, England might have protected and rewarded her. Had she\r\nimitated New York in declaring for the Union, probably the Union would\r\nnot have allowed her to suffer in the end. The attempt to resist both\r\nbelligerents forfeited the forbearance of both. The displeasure of\r\nGreat Britain was shown by a new proclamation, dated April 25, 1814,\r\nincluding the ports of New England in the blockade; so that the whole\r\ncoast of the Union, from New Brunswick to Texas, was declared to be\r\nclosed to commerce by “a naval force adequate to maintain the said\r\nblockade in the most rigorous and effective manner.”[1]\r\n\r\nHowever annoying the blockade might be, it was a trifling evil compared\r\nwith other impending dangers from Great Britain. Invasion might be\r\nexpected, and its object was notorious. England was known to regret the\r\ngreat concessions she had made in the definitive treaty of 1783. She\r\nwished especially to exclude the Americans from the fisheries, and to\r\nrectify the Canadian boundary by recovering a portion of Maine, then a\r\npart of Massachusetts. If Massachusetts by her neutral attitude should\r\ncompel President Madison to make peace on British terms, Massachusetts\r\nmust lose the fisheries and part of the District of Maine; nor was it\r\nlikely that any American outside of New England would greatly regret\r\nher punishment.\r\n\r\nThe extreme Federalists felt that their position could not be\r\nmaintained, and they made little concealment of their wish to commit\r\nthe State in open resistance to the Union. They represented as yet only\r\na minority of their party; but in conspiracies, men who knew what they\r\nwanted commonly ended by controlling the men who did not. Pickering\r\nwas not popular; but he had the advantage of following a definite\r\nplan, familiar for ten years to the party leaders, and founded on the\r\nhistorical idea of a New England Confederation.[2] For Pickering,\r\ndisunion offered no terrors. “On the contrary,” he wrote, July 4, 1813,\r\n“I believe an immediate separation would be a real blessing to the\r\n‘good old thirteen States,’ as John Randolph once called them.”[3] His\r\nviews on this subject were expressed with more or less fidelity and\r\nwith much elaboration in a pamphlet published in 1813 by his literary\r\nrepresentative, John Lowell.[4] His policy was as little disguised as\r\nhis theoretical opinions; and in the early part of the year 1814, under\r\nthe pressure of the embargo, he thought that the time had come for\r\npressing his plan for a fourth time on the consideration of his party.\r\nWithout consulting his old associates of the Essex Junto, he stimulated\r\naction among the people and in the State legislature.\r\n\r\nThe first step was, as usual, to hold town-meetings and adopt addresses\r\nto the General Court. Some forty towns followed this course, and voted\r\naddresses against the embargo and the war. Their spirit was fairly\r\nrepresented by one of the most outspoken, adopted by a town-meeting at\r\nAmherst, over which Noah Webster presided Jan. 3, 1814.[5] The people\r\nvoted--\r\n\r\n   “That the representatives of this town in the General Court are\r\n   desired to use their influence to induce that honorable body to\r\n   take the most vigorous and decisive measures compatible with the\r\n   Constitution to put an end to this hopeless war, and to restore\r\n   to us the blessings of peace. What measures it will be proper\r\n   to take, we pretend not to prescribe; but whatever measures\r\n   they shall think it expedient to adopt, either separately or in\r\n   conjunction with the neighboring States, they may rely upon our\r\n   faithful support.”\r\n\r\nThe town of Newbury in Essex County made itself conspicuous by\r\nadopting, January 31, a memorial inviting bloodshed:--\r\n\r\n   “We remember the resistance of our fathers to oppressions which\r\n   dwindle into insignificance when compared with those which we\r\n   are called on to endure. The rights ‘which we have received\r\n   from God we will never yield to man.’ We call on our State\r\n   legislature to protect us in the enjoyment of those privileges\r\n   to assert which our fathers died, and to defend which we profess\r\n   ourselves ready to resist unto blood. We pray your honorable\r\n   body to adopt measures immediately to secure to us especially\r\n   our undoubted right of trade within our State. We are ourselves\r\n   ready to aid you in securing it to us to the utmost of our\r\n   power, ‘peaceably if we can, forcibly if we must;’ and we pledge\r\n   to you the sacrifice of our lives and property in support of\r\n   whatever measures the dignity and liberties of this free,\r\n   sovereign, and independent State may seem to your wisdom to\r\n   demand.”\r\n\r\nThe voters of Newbury were constituents of Pickering. Their address\r\ncould not have reached him at Washington when a few days afterward he\r\nwrote to Samuel Putnam, an active member of the General Court, then in\r\nsession, urging that the time for remonstrances had passed, and the\r\ntime for action had come:[6]--\r\n\r\n   “Declarations of this sort by Massachusetts, especially if\r\n   concurred in by the other New England States, would settle the\r\n   business at once. But though made now by Massachusetts alone,\r\n   you surely may rely on the co-operation of New Hampshire, Rhode\r\n   Island, and Connecticut, and I doubt not of Vermont and New\r\n   York. With the executives and legislatures of most, and the\r\n   representatives of all of them, you can freely communicate.\r\n   Ought there not to be a proposal of a convention of delegates\r\n   from those six States?”\r\n\r\nThe project of a New England convention was well understood to violate\r\nthe Constitution, and for that reason alone the cautious Federalists\r\ndisliked and opposed it. Doubtless a mere violence done to the law\r\ndid not necessarily imply a wish for disunion. The Constitution was\r\nviolated more frequently by its friends than by its enemies, and often\r\nthe extent of such violations measured the increasing strength of the\r\nUnion. In such matters intent was everything; and the intent of the\r\nproposed New England convention was made evident by the reluctance with\r\nwhich the leaders slowly yielded to the popular demand.\r\n\r\nThe addresses of the towns to the General Court were regularly referred\r\nto a committee, which reported February 18,[7] in a spirit not\r\naltogether satisfactory to the advocates of action:--\r\n\r\n   “Whenever the national compact is violated and the citizens\r\n   of this State are oppressed by cruel and unauthorized laws,\r\n   the legislature is bound to interpose its power and wrest from\r\n   the oppressor his victim. This is the spirit of our Union, and\r\n   thus it has been explained by the very man who now sets at\r\n   defiance all the principles of his early political life.... On\r\n   the subject of a convention, the committee observe that they\r\n   entertain no doubt of the right of the legislature to invite\r\n   other States to a convention and to join it themselves for\r\n   the great purposes of consulting for the general good, and of\r\n   procuring Amendments to the Constitution whenever they find that\r\n   the practical construction given to it by the rulers for the\r\n   time being is contrary to its true spirit and injurious to their\r\n   immediate constituents.... This was the mode proposed by Mr.\r\n   Madison[8] in answer to objections made as to the tendency of\r\n   the general government to usurp upon that of the States.”\r\n\r\nThe _argumentum ad personam_ commonly proved only weakness.\r\nMadison’s authority on these points had always been rejected by the\r\nFederalists when in power; and even he had never asserted the right\r\nof States to combine in convention for resistance to measures of\r\nthe national government, as the General Court was asked to do. So\r\nrevolutionary was the step that the committee of both Houses shrank\r\nfrom it: “They have considered that there are reasons which render\r\nit inexpedient at the present moment to exercise this power.” They\r\nadvised that the subject should not be immediately decided, but\r\nshould be referred to the representatives soon to be returned for the\r\nnext General Court, who would “come from the people still more fully\r\npossessed of their views and wishes as to the all-important subject of\r\nobtaining by future compact, engrafted into the present Constitution,\r\na permanent security against future abuses of power, and of seeking\r\neffectual redress for the grievances and oppressions now endured.”\r\n\r\nTo the people, therefore, the subject of a New England convention was\r\nexpressly referred. The issue was well understood, and excluded all\r\nothers in the coming April election. So serious was the emergency,\r\nand so vital to the Administration and the war was the defeat of a\r\nNew England convention, that the Republicans put forward no party\r\ncandidate, but declared their intention to vote for Samuel Dexter, a\r\nFederalist,--although Dexter, in a letter dated February 14, reiterated\r\nhis old opinions hostile to the embargo, and professed to be no further\r\na Republican than that he offered no indiscriminate opposition to the\r\nwar. His Federalism was that of Rufus King and Bayard.\r\n\r\n   “What good is to be expected,” he asked,[9] “from creating\r\n   division when engaged in war with a powerful nation that has\r\n   not yet explicitly shown that she is willing to agree to\r\n   reasonable terms of peace? Why make publications and speeches\r\n   to prove that we are absolved from allegiance to the national\r\n   government, and hint that an attempt to divide the empire might\r\n   be justified?... The ferocious contest that would be the effect\r\n   of attempting to skulk from a participation of the burdens of\r\n   war would not be the greatest calamity.”\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances the load of the embargo became too heavy for\r\nthe Massachusetts Republicans to carry. They tried in every manner to\r\nthrow it off, as persistently as President Madison tried to hold it\r\non. Their candidate, Dexter, argued strongly against the restrictive\r\nsystem in his letter consenting to stand. They drew a distinction\r\nbetween the restrictive system and the war; but even in regard to the\r\nwar they required not active support, but only abstinence from active\r\nresistance. The Federalists used the embargo to stimulate resistance\r\nto the war, and advocated a New England convention under cover of the\r\nunpopularity of commercial restrictions.\r\n\r\nWith the pertinacity which was his most remarkable trait, Madison clung\r\nto the embargo all winter in face of overwhelming motives to withdraw\r\nit. A large majority in Congress disliked it. England having recovered\r\nher other markets could afford to conquer the American as she had\r\nconquered the European, and to wait a few months for her opportunity.\r\nThe embargo bankrupted the Treasury, threatened to stop the operations\r\nof war, and was as certain as any ordinary antecedent of a consequent\r\nresult to produce a New England convention. Yet the President\r\nmaintained it until the news from Europe caused a panic in Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts election took place in the first days of April,\r\nwhile Congress was engaged in repealing the embargo and the system\r\nof commercial restrictions. The result showed that Dexter might have\r\ncarried the State and defeated the project of a New England convention,\r\nhad the embargo been repealed a few weeks earlier. A very large\r\nvote, about one hundred and two thousand in aggregate, was cast. The\r\nFederalists, whose official vote in 1813 was 56,754, threw 56,374\r\nvotes; while the Republicans, who cast 42,789 votes in 1813, numbered\r\n45,359 in 1814.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of the Federalist majority from fourteen thousand to\r\neleven thousand was not the only reason for believing that Dexter\r\nmight have carried Massachusetts but for the embargo. At the same time\r\nWilliam Plumer, supported like Dexter by the Republicans, very nearly\r\ncarried New Hampshire, and by gaining a majority of the executive\r\ncouncil, precluded the possibility that New Hampshire as a State\r\ncould take part in a New England convention. The President’s Message\r\nrecommending a repeal of the embargo was sent to Congress March 31, and\r\nthe Act of Repeal was signed April 14. Two weeks later, April 28, the\r\nNew York election took place. To this election both parties anxiously\r\nlooked. The Administration press admitted that all was lost if New York\r\njoined Massachusetts,[10] and the New England Federalists knew that a\r\ndecisive defeat in New York would leave them to act alone. The returns\r\nwere watched with such anxiety as had seldom attended a New York\r\nelection, although no general State officer was to be chosen.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1813, Governor Tompkins carried the State by a majority of only\r\n3,506, and the Federalists in the House of Assembly numbered sixty,\r\nwhile the Republicans numbered fifty-two. The city of New York and\r\nthe counties of Queens, Westchester, Dutchess, Columbia, Rensselaer,\r\nand Washington--the entire range of counties on the east shore of the\r\nHudson--were then Federalist. The counties of Albany, Montgomery,\r\nOneida, Otsego, Madison, and Ontario in the centre of the State\r\nwere also Federalist. At the congressional election of 1812, twenty\r\nFederalists and six Republicans had been chosen. The May election\r\nof 1814 was for the State Assembly and for Congress. No opportunity\r\nwas given for testing the general opinion of the State on a single\r\nissue, but no one could mistake what the general opinion was. City and\r\nState reversed their political character. The Republicans recovered\r\npossession of the Assembly with a large majority of seventy-four to\r\nthirty-eight, and the Congressional delegation numbered twenty-one\r\nRepublicans and only six Federalists.\r\n\r\nThe result was supposed to be largely due to a dislike of the New\r\nEngland scheme and to a wish among New York Federalists that it should\r\nbe stopped. The energy of the demonstration in New York marked the\r\nbeginning of an epoch in national character; yet the change came too\r\nlate to save Massachusetts from falling for the first time into the\r\nhands of the extreme Federalists. The towns of Massachusetts chose as\r\ntheir representatives to the General Court a majority bent on taking\r\ndecisive action against the war. Connecticut and Rhode Island were\r\ncontrolled by the same impulse, and the discouraged Republicans could\r\ninterpose no further resistance. A New England convention could be\r\nprevented only by a treaty of peace.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the attitude of New England was felt throughout the\r\nUnion, and, combined with the news from Europe, brought a general\r\nconviction that peace must be made. No man in the Union was more\r\nloyal to the war than Governor Shelby of Kentucky, but Shelby already\r\nadmitted that peace had become necessary.\r\n\r\n   “I may in confidence confess to you,” wrote Shelby, April 8,[11]\r\n   “that I lament over my country that she has in her very bosom a\r\n   faction as relentless as the fire that is unquenchable, capable\r\n   of thwarting her best interests, and whose poisonous breath is\r\n   extending to every corner of the Union. There is but one way\r\n   to cure the evil, and that is an awful and desperate one; and\r\n   in the choice of evils we had better take the least. Were we\r\n   unanimous I should feel it less humiliating to be conquered, as\r\n   I verily believe that the Administration will be driven to peace\r\n   _on any terms_ by the opposition to the war.”\r\n\r\nIf Governor Shelby had reached this conclusion before he knew the\r\nresult of the Massachusetts election, the great mass of citizens who\r\nhad been from the first indifferent to the war felt that peace on any\r\nterms could no longer be postponed. Mere disunion was not the result\r\nchiefly to be feared. That disunion might follow a collapse of the\r\nnational government was possible; but for the time, Massachusetts\r\nseemed rather disposed to sacrifice the rest of the Union for her own\r\npower than to insist on a separation. Had the Eastern States suffered\r\nfrom the hardships of war they might have demanded disunion in despair;\r\nbut in truth New England was pleased at the contrast between her own\r\nprosperity and the sufferings of her neighbors. The blockade and the\r\nembargo brought wealth to her alone. The farming and manufacturing\r\nindustries of New England never grew more rapidly than in the midst of\r\nwar and commercial restrictions.[12] “Machinery for manufactures, etc.,\r\nand the fruits of household industry increase beyond calculation,”\r\nsaid a writer in the “Connecticut Herald” in July, 1813. “Wheels roll,\r\nspindles whirl, shuttles fly. We shall export to other States many\r\nmore productions of industry than ever were exported in any one former\r\nseason.” Manufactures were supposed to amount in value to fifteen or\r\ntwenty million dollars a year. The Federalists estimated the balance\r\ndue by the Southern States to New England at six million dollars a\r\nyear.[13] The New England banks were believed to draw not less than\r\nhalf a million dollars every month from the South.\r\n\r\n   “We are far from rejoicing at this state of things,” wrote a\r\n   Connecticut Federalist;[14] “and yet we cannot but acknowledge\r\n   the hand of retributive justice in inflicting the calamities\r\n   of war with so much more severity on that section of the Union\r\n   which has so rashly and so unmercifully persisted in their\r\n   determination to commence hostilities. The pressure of this\r\n   balance is sensibly felt, and will continue to increase as long\r\n   as the war continues.”\r\n\r\nJohn Lowell declared[15] that “the banks are at their wits’ end to lend\r\ntheir capital, and money is such a drug ... that men against their\r\nconsciences, their honor, their duty, their professions and promises,\r\nare willing to lend it secretly to support the very measures which\r\nare intended and calculated for their ruin.” To avoid the temptation\r\nof lending money to support Madison’s measures, many investors bought\r\nBritish government bills of exchange at twenty to twenty-two per cent\r\ndiscount. These bills were offered for sale in quantities at Boston;\r\nand perhaps the most legitimate reason for their presence there was\r\nthat they were taken by New England contractors in payment for beef and\r\nflour furnished to the British commissariat in Canada.\r\n\r\nWhile New England thus made profits from both sides, and knew not what\r\nto do with the specie that flowed into her banks, the rest of the\r\ncountry was already insolvent, and seemed bent on bankruptcy. In March,\r\n1814, the legislature of Pennsylvania passed a bill for the creation of\r\nforty-one new banks. March 19 Governor Snyder vetoed it.[16]\r\n\r\n   “It is a fact well ascertained,” said Governor Snyder, “that\r\n   immense sums of specie have been withdrawn from the banks in\r\n   Pennsylvania and certain other States to pay balances for\r\n   British goods which Eastern mercantile cupidity has smuggled\r\n   into the United States. The demand for specie has in consequence\r\n   been and is still so great that the banks in Philadelphia and in\r\n   some other parts have stopped discounting any new paper. I ask a\r\n   patriotic legislature, Is this an auspicious era to try so vast\r\n   an experiment? Shall we indirectly aid our internal and external\r\n   enemies to destroy our funds and embarrass the government by\r\n   the creating of forty-one new banks which must have recourse\r\n   for specie to that already much exhausted source? Is there at\r\n   this time an intelligent man in Pennsylvania who believes that a\r\n   bank-note of any description is the representative of specie?”\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania legislature instantly overrode Governor Snyder’s veto\r\nand chartered the new banks, which were, according to the governor,\r\ninsolvent before they had legal existence. In ordinary times such\r\nfollies punished and corrected themselves in regular course; but in\r\n1814 the follies and illusions of many years concentrated their\r\nmischiefs on the national government, which was already unequal to\r\nthe burden of its own. The war was practically at an end as far as\r\nthe government conducted it. The army could not show a regiment with\r\nranks more than half full.[17] The first three months of the year\r\nproduced less than six thousand recruits.[18] The government could\r\ndefend the frontier only at three or four fortified points. On the\r\nocean, government vessels were scarcely to be seen. The Treasury was\r\nas insolvent as the banks, and must soon cease even the pretence of\r\nmeeting its obligations.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury, authorized by law to borrow twenty-five\r\nmillions and needing forty, offered a loan for only ten millions\r\nshortly before Congress adjourned. In Boston the government brokers\r\nadvertised that the names of subscribers should be kept secret,[19]\r\nwhile the Boston “Gazette” of April 14 declared that “any man who lends\r\nhis money to the government at the present time will forfeit all claim\r\nto common honesty and common courtesy among all true friends to the\r\ncountry.” The offers, received May 2, amounted to thirteen millions,\r\nat rates varying from seventy-five to eighty-eight. Jacob Barker, a\r\nprivate banker of New York, offered five million dollars on his single\r\naccount. The secretary knew that Barker’s bid was not substantial, but\r\nhe told the President that if it had been refused “we could not have\r\nobtained the ten millions without allowing terms much less favorable to\r\nthe government.”[20] The terms were bad at best. The secretary obtained\r\nbids more or less substantial for about nine millions at eighty-eight,\r\nwith the condition that if he should accept lower terms for any part\r\nof the sixteen millions still to be offered, the same terms should be\r\nconceded to Barker and his associates. The operation was equivalent to\r\nborrowing nine millions on an understanding that the terms should be\r\nfixed at the close of the campaign. Of this loan Boston offered two\r\nmillions, and was allotted about, one million dollars.\r\n\r\nThe event proved that Campbell would have done better to accept all\r\nsolid bids without regard to rate, for the government could have\r\nafforded to pay two dollars for one within a twelve-month, rather\r\nthan stop payments; but Campbell was earnest to effect his loan at\r\neighty-eight, and accordingly accepted only four million dollars\r\nbesides Barker’s offer. With these four millions, with whatever part\r\nof five millions could be obtained from Barker, with interest-bearing\r\nTreasury notes limited to ten million dollars,[21] and with the\r\nreceipts from taxes, the Treasury was to meet demands aggregating about\r\nforty millions for the year; for the chance was small that another\r\nloan could succeed, no matter what rate should be offered.\r\n\r\nFor this desperate situation of the government New England was chiefly\r\nresponsible. In pursuing their avowed object of putting an end to\r\nthe war the Federalists obtained a degree of success surprising even\r\nto themselves, and explained only by general indifference toward the\r\nwar and the government. No one could suppose that the New England\r\nFederalists, after seeing their object within their grasp, would desist\r\nfrom effecting it. They had good reason to think that between Madison’s\r\nobstinacy and their own, the national government must cease its\r\nfunctions,--that the States must resume their sovereign powers, provide\r\nfor their own welfare, and enter into some other political compact; but\r\nthey could not suppose that England would forego her advantages, or\r\nconsent to any peace which should not involve the overthrow of Madison\r\nand his party.\r\n\r\nIn such conditions of society morbid excitement was natural. Many\r\nexamples in all periods of history could be found to illustrate every\r\nstage of a mania so common. The excitement of the time was not confined\r\nto New England. A typical American man-of-the-world was Gouverneur\r\nMorris. Cool, easy-tempered, incredulous, with convictions chiefly\r\npractical, and illusions largely rhetorical, Morris delivered an\r\noration on the overthrow of Napoleon to a New York audience, June 29,\r\n1814.\r\n\r\n   “And thou too, Democracy! savage and wild!” began Morris’s\r\n   peroration,--“thou who wouldst bring down the virtuous and wise\r\n   to the level of folly and guilt! thou child of squinting envy\r\n   and self-tormenting spleen! thou persecutor of the great and\r\n   good!--see! though it blast thine eyeballs,--see the objects\r\n   of thy deadly hate! See lawful princes surrounded by loyal\r\n   subjects!... Let those who would know the idol of thy devotion\r\n   seek him in the island of Elba!”\r\n\r\nThe idea that American democracy was savage and wild stood in flagrant\r\ncontrast to the tameness of its behavior; but the belief was a part\r\nof conservative faith, and Gouverneur Morris was not ridiculed, even\r\nfor bad taste, by the society to which he belonged, because he called\r\nby inappropriate epithets the form of society which most of his\r\nfellow-citizens preferred. In New England, where democracy was equally\r\nreviled, kings and emperors were not equally admired. The austere\r\nvirtue of the Congregational Church viewed the subject in a severer\r\nlight, and however extreme might be the difference of conviction\r\nbetween clergymen and democrats, it was not a subject for ridicule.\r\n\r\nTo men who believed that every calamity was a Divine judgment, politics\r\nand religion could not be made to accord. Practical politics, being\r\ncommonly an affair of compromise and relative truth,--a human attempt\r\nto modify the severity of Nature’s processes,--could not expect\r\nsympathy from the absolute and abstract behests of religion. Least\r\nof all could war, even in its most necessary form, be applauded or\r\nencouraged by any clergyman who followed the precepts of Christ. The\r\nWar of 1812 was not even a necessary war. Only in a metaphysical or\r\ndishonest sense could any clergyman affirm that war was more necessary\r\nin 1812 than in any former year since the peace of 1783. Diplomacy had\r\nso confused its causes that no one could say for what object Americans\r\nhad intended to fight,--still less, after the peace in Europe, for\r\nwhat object they continued their war. Assuming the conquest of Canada\r\nand of Indian Territory to be the motive most natural to the depraved\r\ninstincts of human nature, the clergy saw every reason for expecting a\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nIn general, the New England clergy did not publicly or violently press\r\nthese ideas. The spirit of their class was grave and restrained rather\r\nthan noisy. Yet a few eccentric or exceptional clergymen preached\r\nand published Fast-day sermons that threw discredit upon the whole\r\nCongregational Church. The chief offenders were two,--David Osgood,\r\nof the church at Medford, and Elijah Parish, a graduate of Dartmouth\r\nCollege, settled over the parish of Byfield in the town of Newbury,\r\nwhere political feeling was strong. Parish’s Fast-day sermon of April\r\n7, 1814, immediately after the election which decided a New England\r\nconvention, was probably the most extreme made from the pulpit:--\r\n\r\n   “Israel’s woes in Egypt terminated in giving them the fruits\r\n   of their own labors. This was a powerful motive for them to\r\n   dissolve their connection with the Ancient Dominion. Though\r\n   their fathers had found their union with Egypt pleasant and\r\n   profitable, though they had been the most opulent section in\r\n   Egypt, yet since the change of the administration their schemes\r\n   had been reversed, their employments changed, their prosperity\r\n   destroyed, their vexations increased beyond all sufferance.\r\n   They were tortured to madness at seeing the fruit of their\r\n   labors torn from them to support a profligate administration....\r\n   They became discouraged; they were perplexed. Moses and others\r\n   exhorted them not to despair, and assured them that _one_ mode\r\n   of relief would prove effectual. Timid, trembling, alarmed, they\r\n   hardly dared to make the experiment. Finally they dissolved the\r\n   Union: they marched; the sea opened; Jordan stopped his current;\r\n   Canaan received their triumphant banners; the trees of the field\r\n   clapped their hands; the hills broke forth into songs of joy;\r\n   they feasted on the fruits of their own labors. Such success\r\n   awaits a resolute and pious people.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Parish’s rhetoric was hardly in worse taste than that of\r\nGouverneur Morris, such exhortations were not held in high esteem by\r\nthe great body of the Congregational clergy, whose teachings were\r\nstudiously free from irreverence or extravagance in the treatment of\r\npolitical subjects.[22] A poor and straitened but educated class, of\r\nwhom not one in four obtained his living wholly from his salary, the\r\nNew England ministers had long ceased to speak with the authority\r\nof their predecessors, and were sustained even in their moderate\r\nprotest against moral wrong rather by pride of class and sincerity\r\nof conviction than by sense of power. Some supported the war; many\r\ndeprecated disunion; nearly all confined their opposition within the\r\nlimits of non-resistance. They held that as the war was unnecessary and\r\nunjust, no one could give it voluntary aid without incurring the guilt\r\nof blood.\r\n\r\nThe attitude was clerical, and from that point of view commanded a\r\ndegree of respect such as was yielded to the similar conscientiousness\r\nof the Friends; but it was fatal to government and ruinous to New\r\nEngland. Nothing but confusion could result from it if the war should\r\ncontinue, while the New England church was certain to be the first\r\nvictim if peace should invigorate the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER the close of the campaign on the St. Lawrence, in\r\nNovember, 1813, General Wilkinson’s army, numbering about eight\r\nthousand men, sick and well, went into winter-quarters at French Mills,\r\non the Canada line, about eight miles south of the St. Lawrence.\r\nWilkinson was unfit for service, and asked leave to remove to Albany,\r\nleaving Izard in command; but Armstrong was not yet ready to make the\r\nnew arrangements, and Wilkinson remained with the army during the\r\nwinter. His force seemed to stand in a good position for annoying the\r\nenemy and interrupting communications between Upper and Lower Canada;\r\nbut it lay idle between November 13 and February 1, when, under orders\r\nfrom Armstrong, it was broken up.[23] Brigadier-General Brown, with two\r\nthousand men, was sent to Sackett’s Harbor. The rest of the army was\r\nordered to fall back to Plattsburg,--a point believed most likely to\r\nattract the enemy’s notice in the spring.[24]\r\n\r\nWilkinson obeyed, and found himself, in March, at Plattsburg with\r\nabout four thousand effectives. He was at enmity with superiors and\r\nsubordinates alike; but the chief object of his antipathy was the\r\nSecretary of War. From Plattsburg, March 27, he wrote a private letter\r\nto Major-General Dearborn,[25] whose hostility to the secretary was\r\nalso pronounced: “I know of his [Armstrong’s] secret underworkings, and\r\nhave therefore, to take the bull by the horns, demanded an arrest and\r\na court-martial.... Good God! I am astonished at the man’s audacity,\r\nwhen he must be sensible of the power I have over him.” Pending the\r\nreply to his request for a court-martial, Wilkinson determined to make\r\na military effort. “My advanced post is at Champlain on this side. I\r\nmove to-day; and the day after to-morrow, if the ice, snow, and frost\r\nshould not disappear, we shall visit the Lacolle, and take possession\r\nof that place. This is imperiously enjoined to check the reinforcements\r\nhe [Prevost] continues to send to the Upper Province.”[26]\r\n\r\nThe Lacolle was a small river, or creek, emptying into the Sorel\r\nfour or five miles beyond the boundary. According to the monthly\r\nreturn of the troops commanded by Major-General de Rottenburg, the\r\nBritish forces stationed about Montreal numbered, Jan. 22, 1814, eight\r\nthousand rank-and-file present for duty. Of these, eight hundred and\r\neighty-five were at St. John’s; six hundred and ninety were at Isle\r\naux Noix, with outposts at Lacadie and Lacolle of three hundred and\r\nthirty-two men.[27]\r\n\r\nWilkinson knew that the British outpost at the crossing of Lacolle\r\nCreek, numbering two hundred men all told,[28] was without support\r\nnearer than Isle aux Noix ten miles away; but it was stationed\r\nin a stone mill, with thick walls and a solid front. He took two\r\ntwelve-pound field-guns to batter the mill, and crossing the boundary,\r\nMarch 30, with his four thousand men, advanced four or five miles to\r\nLacolle Creek. The roads were obstructed and impassable, but his troops\r\nmade their way in deep snow through the woods until they came within\r\nsight of the mill. The guns were then placed in position and opened\r\nfire; but Wilkinson was disconcerted to find that after two hours the\r\nmill was unharmed. He ventured neither to storm it nor flank it; and\r\nafter losing more than two hundred men by the fire of the garrison, he\r\nordered a retreat, and marched his army back to Champlain.\r\n\r\nWith this last example of his military capacity Wilkinson disappeared\r\nfrom the scene of active life, where he had performed so long and\r\nextraordinary a part. Orders arrived, dated March 24, relieving him\r\nfrom duty under the form of granting his request for a court of\r\ninquiry. Once more he passed the ordeal of a severe investigation, and\r\nreceived the verdict of acquittal; but he never was again permitted to\r\nresume his command in the army.\r\n\r\nThe force Wilkinson had brought from Lake Ontario, though united\r\nwith that which Wade Hampton had organized, was reduced by sickness,\r\nexpiration of enlistments, and other modes of depletion to a mere\r\nhandful when Major-General Izard arrived at Plattsburg on the first\r\nday of May. Izard’s experience formed a separate narrative, and made\r\na part of the autumn campaign. During the early summer the war took\r\na different and unexpected direction, following the steps of the new\r\nMajor-General Brown; for wherever Brown went, fighting followed.\r\n\r\nGeneral Brown marched from French Mills, February 13, with two thousand\r\nmen. February 28, Secretary Armstrong wrote him a letter suggesting an\r\nattack on Kingston, to be covered by a feint on Niagara.[29] Brown, on\r\narriving at Sackett’s Harbor, consulted Chauncey, and allowed himself\r\nto be dissuaded from attacking Kingston. “By some extraordinary mental\r\nprocess,” Armstrong thought,[30] Brown and Chauncey “arrived at the\r\nsame conclusion,--that the main action, an attack on Kingston, being\r\nimpracticable, the _ruse_, intended merely to mask it, might do as\r\nwell.” Brown immediately marched with two thousand men for Niagara.\r\n\r\nWhen the secretary learned of this movement, although it was contrary\r\nto his ideas of strategy, he wrote an encouraging letter to Brown,\r\nMarch 20:[31]\r\n\r\n   “You have mistaken my meaning.... If you hazard anything by this\r\n   mistake, correct it promptly by returning to your post. If on\r\n   the other hand you left the Harbor with a competent force for\r\n   its defence, go on and prosper. Good consequences are sometimes\r\n   the result of mistakes.”\r\n\r\nThe correspondence showed chiefly that neither the secretary nor the\r\ngeneral had a distinct idea, and that Brown’s campaign, like Dearborn’s\r\nthe year before, received its direction from Chauncey, whose repugnance\r\nto attacking Kingston was invincible.\r\n\r\nBrown was shown his mistake by Gaines, before reaching Buffalo March\r\n24, and leaving his troops, he hurried back to Sackett’s Harbor,\r\n“the most unhappy man alive.”[32] He resumed charge of such troops\r\nas remained at the Harbor, while Winfield Scott formed a camp of\r\ninstruction at Buffalo, and, waiting for recruits who never came,\r\npersonally drilled the officers of all grades. Scott’s energy threw\r\ninto the little army a spirit and an organization strange to the\r\nservice. Three months of instruction converted the raw troops into\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Brown could do nothing at Sackett’s Harbor. The British\r\nheld control of the Lake, while Commodore Chauncey and the contractor\r\nEckford were engaged in building a new ship which was to be ready\r\nin July. The British nearly succeeded in preventing Chauncey from\r\nappearing on the Lake during the entire season, for no sooner did Sir\r\nJames Yeo sail from Kingston in the spring than he attempted to destroy\r\nthe American magazines. Owing to the remote situation of Sackett’s\r\nHarbor in the extreme northern corner of the State, all supplies and\r\nwar material were brought first from the Hudson River to Oswego by way\r\nof the Mohawk River and Oneida Lake. About twelve miles above Oswego\r\nthe American magazines were established, and there the stores were kept\r\nuntil they could be shipped on schooners, and forwarded fifty miles\r\nalong the Lake-shore to Sackett’s Harbor,--always a hazardous operation\r\nin the face of an enemy’s fleet. The destruction of the magazines would\r\nhave been fatal to Chauncey, and even the capture or destruction of the\r\nschooners with stores was no trifling addition to his difficulties.\r\n\r\nSir James Yeo left Kingston May 4, and appeared off Oswego the next\r\nday, bringing a large body of troops, numbering more than a thousand\r\nrank-and-file.[33] They found only about three hundred men to oppose\r\nthem, and having landed May 6, they gained possession of the fort\r\nwhich protected the harbor of Oswego. The Americans made a resistance\r\nwhich caused a loss of seventy-two men killed and wounded to the\r\nBritish, among the rest Captain Mulcaster of the Royal Navy, an active\r\nofficer, who was dangerously wounded. The result was hardly worth the\r\nloss. Four schooners were captured or destroyed, and some twenty-four\r\nhundred barrels of flour, pork, and salt, but nothing of serious\r\nimportance.[34] Yeo made no attempt to ascend the river, and retired to\r\nKingston after destroying whatever property he could not take away.\r\n\r\nAlthough the chief American depot escaped destruction, the disgrace and\r\ndiscouragement remained, that after two years of war the Americans,\r\nthough enjoying every advantage, were weaker than ever on Lake Ontario,\r\nand could not defend even so important a point as Oswego from the\r\nattack of barely a thousand men. Their coastwise supply of stores to\r\nSackett’s Harbor became a difficult and dangerous undertaking, to be\r\nperformed mostly by night.[35] Chauncey remained practically blockaded\r\nin Sackett’s Harbor; and without his fleet in control of the Lake the\r\narmy could do nothing effectual against Kingston.\r\n\r\nIn this helplessness, Armstrong was obliged to seek some other line on\r\nwhich the army could be employed against Upper Canada; and the idea\r\noccurred to him that although he had no fleet on Lake Ontario he had\r\none on Lake Erie, which by a little ingenuity might enable the army to\r\napproach the heart of Upper Canada at the extreme western end of Lake\r\nOntario. “Eight or even six thousand men,” Armstrong wrote[36] to the\r\nPresident, April 30, “landed in the bay between Point Abino and Fort\r\nErie, and operating either on the line of the Niagara, or more directly\r\nif a more direct route is found, against the British post at the head\r\nof Burlington Bay, cannot be resisted with effect without compelling\r\nthe enemy so to weaken his more eastern posts as to bring them within\r\nreach of our means at Sackett’s Harbor and Plattsburg.”\r\n\r\nArmstrong’s suggestion was made to the President April 30. Already\r\ntime was short. The allies had entered Paris March 31; the citadel of\r\nBayonne capitulated to Wellington April 28. In a confidential despatch\r\ndated June 3, Lord Bathurst notified the governor-general of Canada\r\nthat ten thousand men had been ordered to be shipped immediately\r\nfor Quebec.[37] July 5, Major-General Torrens at the Horse-guards\r\ninformed Prevost that four brigades,--Brisbane’s, Kempt’s, Power’s, and\r\nRobinson’s; fourteen regiments of Wellington’s best troops,--had sailed\r\nfrom Bordeaux for Canada.[38] Prevost could afford in July to send\r\nwestward every regular soldier in Lower Canada, sure of replacing them\r\nat Montreal by the month of August.\r\n\r\n“A discrepancy in the opinions of the Cabinet,” according to\r\nArmstrong,[39] delayed adoption of a plan till June, when a compromise\r\nscheme was accepted,[40] but not carried out.\r\n\r\n   “Two causes prevented its being acted upon _in extenso_,”\r\n   Armstrong afterward explained,[41]--“the one, a total failure\r\n   in getting together by militia calls and volunteer overtures\r\n   a force deemed competent to a campaign of demonstration and\r\n   manœuvre on the peninsula; the other, an apprehension that the\r\n   fleet, which had been long inactive, would not yet be found\r\n   in condition to sustain projects requiring from it a vigorous\r\n   co-operation with the army.”\r\n\r\nBrown might have been greatly strengthened at Niagara by drawing\r\nfrom Detroit the men that could be spared there; but the Cabinet\r\nobliged Armstrong to send the Detroit force--about nine hundred in\r\nnumber--against Mackinaw. Early in July the Mackinaw expedition,\r\ncommanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Croghan, started from Detroit, and\r\nAugust 4 it was defeated and returned. Croghan’s expedition did not\r\neven arrive in time to prevent a British expedition from Mackinaw\r\ncrossing Wisconsin and capturing, July 19, the distant American post at\r\nPrairie du Chien.[42]\r\n\r\nArmstrong did not favor Croghan’s expedition, wishing to bring him and\r\nhis two batteries to reinforce Brown, but yielded to the Secretary of\r\nthe Navy, who wished to capture Mackinaw,[43] and to the promises\r\nof Commodore Chauncey that on or before July 1 he would sail from\r\nSackett’s Harbor, and command the Lake. In reliance on Chauncey, the\r\nCabinet, except Monroe, decided that Major-General Brown should cross\r\nto the Canadian side, above the Falls of Niagara, and march, with\r\nChauncey’s support, to Burlington Heights and to York.[44]\r\n\r\nThis decision was made June 7, and Armstrong wrote to Brown, June 10,\r\ndescribing the movement intended.[45] The Secretary of the Navy, he\r\nsaid, thought Chauncey could not be ready before July 15:\r\n\r\n   “To give, however, immediate occupation to your troops, and to\r\n   prevent their blood from stagnating, why not take Fort Erie and\r\n   its garrison, stated at three or four hundred men? Land between\r\n   Point Abino and Erie in the night; assail the Fort by land and\r\n   water; push forward a corps to seize the bridge at Chippawa;\r\n   and be governed by circumstances in either stopping there or\r\n   going farther. Boats may follow and feed you. If the enemy\r\n   concentrates his whole force on this line, as I think he will,\r\n   it will not exceed two thousand men.”\r\n\r\nBrown had left Sackett’s Harbor, and was at Buffalo when these orders\r\nreached him. He took immediate measures to carry them out. Besides his\r\nregular force, he called for volunteers to be commanded by Peter B.\r\nPorter; and he wrote to Chauncey, June 21,[46] an irritating letter,\r\ncomplaining of having received not a line from him, and giving a sort\r\nof challenge to the navy to meet the army before Fort George, by July\r\n10. The letter showed that opinion in the army ran against the navy,\r\nand particularly against Chauncey, whom Brown evidently regarded\r\nas a sort of naval Wilkinson. In truth, Brown could depend neither\r\nupon Chauncey nor upon volunteers. The whole force he could collect\r\nwas hardly enough to cross the river, and little exceeded the three\r\nthousand men on whose presence at once in the boats Alexander Smyth had\r\ninsisted eighteen months before, in order to capture Fort Erie.\r\n\r\nSo famous did Brown’s little army become, that the details of its force\r\nand organization retained an interest equalled only by that which\r\nattached to the frigates and sloops-of-war. Although the existence\r\nof the regiments ceased with the peace, and their achievements were\r\nlimited to a single campaign of three or four months, their fame\r\nwould have insured them in any other service extraordinary honors and\r\nsedulous preservation of their identity. Two small brigades of regular\r\ntroops, and one still smaller brigade of Pennsylvania volunteers, with\r\na corps of artillery, composed the entire force. The first brigade was\r\ncommanded by Brigadier-General Winfield Scott, and its monthly return\r\nof June 30,1814, reported its organization and force as follows:[47]--\r\n\r\n\r\n             _Strength of the First, or Scott’s, Brigade._\r\n\r\n                                PRESENT FOR DUTY.

The Eleventh was raised in Vermont, and\r\nwas led by Major John McNeil. The Twenty-second was a Pennsylvania\r\nregiment, commanded by its colonel, Hugh Brady. The Twenty-fifth was\r\nenlisted in Connecticut, and identified by the name of T. S. Jesup,\r\none of its majors. The whole brigade, officers and privates, numbered\r\nthirteen hundred and eighty-four men present for duty on the first day\r\nof July, 1814.\r\n\r\nThe Second, or Ripley’s, brigade was still smaller, and became even\r\nmore famous. Eleazar Wheelock Ripley was born in New Hampshire, in the\r\nyear 1782. He became a resident of Portland in Maine, and was sent as a\r\nrepresentative to the State legislature at Boston, where he was chosen\r\nspeaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, Jan. 17, 1812,\r\non the retirement of Joseph Story to become a Justice of the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States. A few weeks afterward, March 12, 1812,\r\nRipley took the commission of lieutenant-colonel of the Twenty-first\r\nregiment, to be enlisted in Massachusetts. A year afterward he\r\nbecame colonel of the same regiment, and took part in the battle of\r\nChrystler’s Field. Secretary Armstrong made him a brigadier-general\r\nApril 15, 1814, his commission bearing date about a month after that\r\nof Winfield Scott. Both the new brigadiers were sent to Niagara, where\r\nScott formed a brigade from regiments trained by himself; and Ripley\r\nwas given a brigade composed of his old regiment, the Twenty-first,\r\nwith detachments from the Seventeenth and Nineteenth and Twenty-third.\r\nThe strength of the brigade, July 1, 1814, was reported in the monthly\r\nreturn as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n            _Strength of the Second, or Ripley’s, Brigade._\r\n\r\n                                PRESENT FOR DUTY.

His headquarters were at Fort George, where he\r\nhad nine hundred and twenty-seven rank-and-file present for duty.\r\nOpposite Fort George, in Fort Niagara on the American side, five\r\nhundred and seventy-eight rank-and-file were present for duty. At\r\nQueenston were two hundred and fifty-eight; at Chippawa, four hundred\r\nand twenty-eight; at Fort Erie, one hundred and forty-six. In all,\r\non the Niagara River Riall commanded two thousand three hundred and\r\nthirty-seven rank-and-file present for duty. The officers, musicians,\r\netc., numbered three hundred and thirty-two. At that time only about\r\none hundred and seventy men were on the sick list. All told, sick\r\nand well, the regular force numbered two thousand eight hundred and\r\nforty men.[49] They belonged chiefly to the First, or Royal Scots; the\r\nEighth, or King’s; the Hundredth, the Hundred-and-third regiments, and\r\nthe Artillery, with a few dragoons.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Porter’s volunteers were ready, the whole American army\r\nwas thrown across the river. The operation was effected early in\r\nthe morning of July 3; and although the transport was altogether\r\ninsufficient, the movement was accomplished without accident or delay.\r\nScott’s brigade with the artillery landed below Fort Erie; Ripley\r\nlanded above; the Indians gained the rear; and the Fort, which was an\r\nopen work, capitulated at five o’clock in the afternoon. One hundred\r\nand seventy prisoners, including officers of all ranks,[50] being\r\ntwo companies of the Eighth and Hundredth British regiments were\r\nsurrendered by the major in command.\r\n\r\nThe next British position was at Chippawa, about sixteen miles below.\r\nTo Chippawa Major-General Riall hastened from Fort George, on hearing\r\nthat the American army had crossed the river above; and there, within a\r\nfew hours, he collected about fifteen hundred regulars and six hundred\r\nmilitia and Indians, behind the Chippawa River, in a position not to\r\nbe assailed in front. The American army also hastened toward Chippawa.\r\nOn the morning of July 4 Scott’s brigade led the way, and after an\r\nexhausting march of twelve hours, the enemy tearing up the bridges in\r\nretiring, Scott reached Chippawa plain toward sunset, and found Riall’s\r\nforce in position beyond the Chippawa River. Scott could only retire a\r\nmile or two, behind the nearest water,--a creek, or broad ditch, called\r\nStreet’s Creek,--where he went into camp. Brown and Ripley, with the\r\nsecond brigade and artillery, came up two or three hours later, at\r\neleven o’clock in the night.[51] Porter followed the next morning.\r\n\r\nBrown, knowing his numbers to be about twice those of Riall, was\r\nanxious to attack before Riall could be reinforced; and on the morning\r\nof July 5, leaving Ripley and Porter’s brigades encamped in the rear,\r\nhe reconnoitred the line of the Chippawa River, and gave orders for\r\nconstructing a bridge above Riall’s position. The bridge was likely\r\nto be an affair of several days, and Riall showed a disposition to\r\ninterfere with it. His scouts and Indians crossed and occupied the\r\nwoods on the American left, driving in the pickets and annoying the\r\nreconnoitring party, and even the camp. To dislodge them, Porter’s\r\nvolunteers and Indians were ordered forward to clear the woods; and at\r\nabout half-past four o’clock in the afternoon, Porter’s advance began\r\nto drive the enemy’s Indians back, pressing forward nearly to the\r\nChippawa River. There the advancing volunteers and Indians suddenly\r\nbecame aware that the whole British army was in the act of crossing\r\nthe Chippawa Bridge on their flank. The surprise was complete, and\r\nPorter’s brigade naturally broke and fell back in confusion.[52]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    PLAN\r\n    OF THE\r\n    BATTLE OF CHIPPAWA\r\n\r\n    STRUTHERS & CO., ENGR’S, N. Y.]\r\n\r\nNo one could have been more surprised than Brown, or more incredulous\r\nthan Scott, at Riall’s extraordinary movement. The idea that a British\r\nforce of two thousand men at most should venture to attack more than\r\nthree thousand, with artillery, covered by a deep, miry creek, had not\r\nentered their minds. Riall drew up his little army in three columns on\r\nthe Chippawa plain,--the King’s regiment four hundred and eighty strong\r\nin advance, supported by the Royal Scots five hundred strong, and the\r\nHundredth four hundred and fifty strong, with a troop of dragoons and\r\nartillerists; in all about fifteen hundred regular troops, with two\r\ntwenty-four-pound field-pieces and a five-and-a-half inch howitzer. Six\r\nhundred militia and Indians occupied the woods.[53] The whole force\r\nadvanced in order of battle toward Street’s Creek.\r\n\r\nBrown was at the front when this movement was made. Porter was routed.\r\nRipley with the second brigade was in the rear. Scott, having rested\r\nhis brigade in the morning and given them a dinner to celebrate the\r\nFourth of July, had ordered a grand parade “to keep his men in breath,”\r\nas he said; and while Riall’s regular force, fifteen hundred strong,\r\nformed on the Chippawa plain a mile away, Scott’s brigade--which\r\na week before had been reported as containing thirteen hundred men\r\npresent for duty, and if all its details had been called in could\r\nhardly have exceeded thirteen hundred men in the ranks on the afternoon\r\nof July 5--was forming, before crossing the little bridge over Street’s\r\nCreek to parade on the plain already occupied by the British. Owing to\r\nthe brushwood that lined the creek Scott could not see the plain, and\r\nreceived no notice of danger until he approached the bridge at the head\r\nof his brigade. At that moment General Brown in full gallop from the\r\nfront rode by, calling out in passing, “You will have a battle!”[54]\r\nScott remarked that he did not believe he should find three hundred\r\nBritish to fight, and crossed the bridge.\r\n\r\nIf Riall was unwise to attack, Scott tempted destruction by leaving\r\nhis secure position behind the creek; but at that moment he was in his\r\nhappiest temper. He meant to show what he and his brigade could do. As\r\nhis thin column crossed the bridge, the British twenty-four-pound guns\r\nopened upon it; but the American line moved on, steady as veterans,\r\nand formed in order of battle beyond. Towson’s three twelve-pounders\r\nwere placed in position near the river on the extreme right, and opened\r\nfire on the heavier British battery opposite. The infantry deployed in\r\nthree battalions,--the right, under Major Leavenworth of the Ninth;\r\nthe centre, under Major McNeil of the Eleventh; the left, under Major\r\nJesup of the Twenty-fifth. Throwing the flanks obliquely forward,\r\nand extending Jesup’s battalion into the woods on the left to prevent\r\noutflanking, Scott ordered an advance; and at the same time Riall\r\ndirected the Royal Scots and the Hundredth to charge.[55] The two\r\nlines advanced, stopping alternately to fire and move forward, while\r\nTowson’s guns, having blown up a British caisson, were turned on the\r\nBritish column. The converging American fire made havoc in the British\r\nranks, and when the two lines came within some sixty or seventy paces\r\nof each other in the centre, the flanks were actually in contact. Then\r\nthe whole British line broke and crumbled away.[56] Ripley’s brigade,\r\narriving soon afterward, found no enemy on the plain. The battle had\r\nlasted less than an hour.\r\n\r\nRiall’s report made no concealment of his defeat.[57]\r\n\r\n   “I placed two light twenty-four-pounders and a five-and-a-half\r\n   inch howitzer,” he said, “against the right of the enemy’s\r\n   position, and formed the Royal Scots and Hundredth regiment with\r\n   the intention of making a movement upon his left, which deployed\r\n   with the greatest regularity and opened a very heavy fire. I\r\n   immediately moved up the King’s regiment to the right, while\r\n   the Royal Scots and Hundredth regiments were directed to charge\r\n   the enemy in front, for which they advanced with the greatest\r\n   gallantry under a most destructive fire. I am sorry to say,\r\n   however, in this attempt they suffered so severely that I was\r\n   obliged to withdraw them, finding their further efforts against\r\n   the superior numbers of the enemy would be unavailing.”\r\n\r\nFor completeness, Scott’s victory at Chippawa could be compared with\r\nthat of Isaac Hull over the “Guerriere;” but in one respect Scott\r\nsurpassed Hull. The “Constitution” was a much heavier ship than its\r\nenemy; but Scott’s brigade was weaker, both in men and guns, than\r\nRiall’s force. Even in regulars, man against man, Scott was certainly\r\noutnumbered. His brigade could not have contained, with artillerists,\r\nmore than thirteen hundred men present on the field,[58] while Riall\r\nofficially reported his regulars at fifteen hundred, and his irregular\r\ncorps at six hundred. Scott’s flank was exposed and turned by the\r\nrout of Porter. He fought with a creek in his rear, where retreat was\r\ndestruction. He had three twelve-pound field-pieces, one of which was\r\nsoon dismounted, against two twenty-four-pounders and a five-and-a-half\r\ninch howitzer. He crossed the bridge and deployed under the enemy’s\r\nfire. Yet the relative losses showed that he was the superior of his\r\nenemy in every respect, and in none more than in the efficiency of his\r\nguns.\r\n\r\nRiall reported a total loss in killed, wounded, and missing of five\r\nhundred and fifteen men,[59] not including Indians. Scott and Porter\r\nreported a total loss of two hundred and ninety-seven, not including\r\nIndians. Riall’s regular regiments and artillery lost one hundred\r\nand thirty-seven killed, and three hundred and five wounded. Scott’s\r\nbrigade reported forty-eight killed and two hundred and twenty-seven\r\nwounded. The number of Riall’s killed was nearly three times the number\r\nof Scott’s killed, and proved that the battle was decided by the\r\nsuperior accuracy or rapidity of the musketry and artillery fire, other\r\nmilitary qualities being assumed to be equal.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Chippawa was the only occasion during the war when equal\r\nbodies of regular troops met face to face, in extended lines on an open\r\nplain in broad daylight, without advantage of position; and never again\r\nafter that combat was an army of American regulars beaten by British\r\ntroops. Small as the affair was, and unimportant in military results,\r\nit gave to the United States army a character and pride it had never\r\nbefore possessed.\r\n\r\nRiall regained the protection of his lines without further loss; but\r\ntwo days afterward Brown turned his position, and Riall abandoned it\r\nwith the whole peninsula except Fort George.[60] Leaving garrisons in\r\nFort George and Fort Niagara, he fell back toward Burlington Bay to\r\nawait reinforcements. Brown followed as far as Queenston, where he\r\ncamped July 10, doubtful what next to do. Fretting under the enforced\r\ndelay, he wrote to Commodore Chauncey, July 13, a letter that led to\r\nmuch comment:[61]--\r\n\r\n   “I have looked for your fleet with the greatest anxiety since\r\n   the 10th. I do not doubt my ability to meet the enemy in the\r\n   field, and to march in any direction over his country, your\r\n   fleet carrying for me the necessary supplies.... There is not a\r\n   doubt resting in my mind but that we have between us the command\r\n   of sufficient means to conquer Upper Canada within two months,\r\n   if there is a prompt and zealous co-operation and a vigorous\r\n   application of these means.”\r\n\r\nBrown, like Andrew Jackson, with the virtues of a militia general,\r\npossessed some of the faults. His letter to Chauncey expressed his\r\nhonest belief; but he was mistaken, and the letter tended to create\r\na popular impression that Chauncey was wholly to blame. Brown could\r\nnot, even with Chauncey’s help, conquer Upper Canada. He was in danger\r\nof being himself destroyed; and even at Queenston he was not safe.\r\nRiall had already received, July 9, a reinforcement of seven hundred\r\nregulars;[62] at his camp, only thirteen miles from Brown, he had\r\ntwenty-two hundred men; in garrison at Fort George and Niagara he\r\nleft more than a thousand men; Lieutenant-General Drummond was on his\r\nway from Kingston with the Eighty-ninth regiment four hundred strong,\r\nunder Colonel Morrison, who had won the battle of Chrystler’s Field,\r\nwhile still another regiment, DeWatteville’s, was on the march. Four\r\nthousand men were concentrating on Fort George, and Chauncey, although\r\nhe might have delayed, could not have prevented their attacking Brown,\r\nor stopping his advance.\r\n\r\nBrown was so well aware of his own weakness that he neither tried to\r\nassault Fort George nor to drive Riall farther away, although Ripley\r\nand the two engineer officers McRee and Wood advised the attempt.[63]\r\nAfter a fortnight passed below Queenston, he suddenly withdrew to\r\nChippawa July 24, and camped on the battle-field. Riall instantly\r\nleft his camp at eleven o’clock in the night of July 24, and followed\r\nBrown’s retreat with about a thousand men, as far as Lundy’s Lane, only\r\na mile below the Falls of Niagara. There he camped at seven o’clock on\r\nthe morning of July 25, waiting for the remainder of his force, about\r\nthirteen hundred men, who marched at noon, and were to arrive at sunset.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Chippawa and three weeks of active campaigning had told\r\non the Americans. According to the army returns of the last week in\r\nJuly, Brown’s army at Chippawa, July 25, numbered twenty-six hundred\r\neffectives.[64]\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Strength of Major-General Brown’s Army, Chippawa, July 25, 1814._\r\n\r\n                       PRESENT FOR DUTY.

He was with reason anxious for his\r\nrear. His position was insecure and unsatisfactory except for attack.\r\nFrom the moment it became defensive, it was unsafe and needed to be\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nThe British generals were able to move on either bank of the river.\r\nWhile Riall at seven o’clock in the morning went into camp within a\r\nmile of Niagara Falls, Lieutenant-General Gordon Drummond with the\r\nEighty-ninth regiment disembarked at Fort George, intending to carry\r\nout a long-prepared movement on the American side.[65]\r\n\r\nGordon Drummond, who succeeded Major-General de Rottenburg in\r\nthe command of Upper Canada in December, 1813, and immediately\r\ndistinguished himself by the brilliant capture of Fort Niagara and\r\nthe destruction of Buffalo, was regarded as the ablest military\r\nofficer in Canada. Isaac Brock’s immediate successors in the civil and\r\nmilitary government of Upper Canada were Major-Generals Sheaffe and De\r\nRottenburg. Neither had won distinction; but Gordon Drummond was an\r\nofficer of a different character. Born in 1772, he entered the army in\r\n1789 as an ensign in the First regiment, or Royal Scots, and rose in\r\n1794 to be lieutenant-colonel of the Eighth, or King’s regiment. He\r\nserved in the Netherlands, the West Indies, and in Egypt, before being\r\nordered to Canada in 1808. In 1811 he became lieutenant-general. He was\r\nat Kingston when his subordinate officer, Major-General Riall, lost the\r\nbattle of Chippawa and retired toward Burlington Heights. Having sent\r\nforward all the reinforcements he could spare, Drummond followed as\r\nrapidly as possible to take command in person.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did Drummond reach Fort George than, in pursuance of orders\r\npreviously given, he sent a detachment of about six hundred men across\r\nthe river to Lewiston. Its appearance there was at once made known\r\nto Brown at Chippawa, only six or seven miles above, and greatly\r\nalarmed him for the safety of his base at Fort Schlosser, Black Rock,\r\nand Buffalo. Had Drummond advanced up the American side with fifteen\r\nhundred men, as he might have done, he would have obliged Brown to\r\nre-cross the river, and might perhaps have destroyed or paralyzed him;\r\nbut Drummond decided to join Riall, and accordingly, recalling the\r\ndetachment from Lewiston at four o’clock in the afternoon, he began his\r\nmarch up the Canadian side with eight hundred and fifteen rank-and-file\r\nto Lundy’s Lane.[66]\r\n\r\nAt five o’clock, July 25, the British army was nearly concentrated.\r\nThe advance under Riall at Lundy’s Lane numbered nine hundred and\r\nfifty rank-and-file, with the three field-pieces which had been in the\r\nbattle of Chippawa, and either two or three six-pounders.[67] Drummond\r\nwas three miles below with eight hundred and fifteen rank-and-file,\r\nmarching up the river; and Colonel Scott of the One Hundred-and-third\r\nregiment, with twelve hundred and thirty rank-and-file and two more\r\nsix-pound field-pieces, was a few miles behind Drummond.[68] By nine\r\no’clock in the evening the three corps, numbering three thousand\r\nrank-and-file, with eight field-pieces, were to unite at Lundy’s Lane.\r\n\r\nAt a loss to decide on which bank the British generals meant to\r\nmove, Brown waited until afternoon, and then, in great anxiety for\r\nthe American side of the river, ordered Winfield Scott to march his\r\nbrigade down the road toward Queenston on the Canadian side, in the\r\nhope of recalling the enemy from the American side by alarming him for\r\nthe safety of his rear. Scott, always glad to be in motion, crossed\r\nChippawa bridge, with his brigade and Towson’s battery, soon after\r\nfive o’clock, and to his great surprise, in passing a house near the\r\nFalls, learned that a large body of British troops was in sight below.\r\nWith his usual audacity he marched directly upon them, and reaching\r\nLundy’s Lane, deployed to the left in line of battle. Jesup, Brady,\r\nLeavenworth, and McNeil placed their little battalions, numbering at\r\nthe utmost a thousand rank-and-file, in position, and Towson opened\r\nwith his three guns. The field suited their ambition. The sun was\r\nsetting at the end of a long, hot, midsummer day. About a mile to their\r\nright the Niagara River flowed through its chasm, and the spray of the\r\ncataract rose in the distance behind them.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    PLAN OF THE\r\n    BATTLE\r\n    OF\r\n    LUNDY’S LANE\r\n    AT SUNSET\r\n\r\n    STRUTHERS & CO., ENGR’S, N. Y.]\r\n\r\nAt the first report that the American army was approaching, Riall\r\nordered a retreat, and his advance was already in march from the field\r\nwhen Drummond arrived with the Eighty-ninth regiment, and countermanded\r\nthe order.[69] Drummond then formed his line, numbering according to\r\nhis report sixteen hundred men, but in reality seventeen hundred and\r\nseventy rank-and-file,[70]--the left resting on the high road, his\r\ntwo twenty-four-pound brass field-pieces, two six-pounders, and a\r\nfive-and-a-half-inch howitzer a little advanced in front of his centre\r\non the summit of the low hill, and his right stretching forward so as\r\nto overlap Scott’s position in attacking. Lundy’s Lane, at right angles\r\nwith the river, ran close behind the British position. Hardly had he\r\ncompleted his formation, when, in his own words, “the whole front was\r\nwarmly and closely engaged.”\r\n\r\nWith all the energy Scott could throw into his blow, he attacked the\r\nBritish left and centre. Drummond’s left stopped slightly beyond the\r\nroad, and was assailed by Jesup’s battalion, the Twenty-fifth regiment,\r\nwhile Scott’s other battalions attacked in front. So vigorous was\r\nJesup’s assault that he forced back the Royal Scots and Eighty-ninth,\r\nand got into the British rear, where he captured Major-General Riall\r\nhimself, as he left the field seriously wounded. “After repeated\r\nattacks,” said Drummond’s report, “the troops on the left were\r\npartially forced back, and the enemy gained a momentary possession\r\nof the road.” In the centre also Scott attacked with obstinacy; but\r\nthe British artillery was altogether too strong and posted too high\r\nfor Towson’s three guns, which at last ceased firing.[71] There\r\nthe Americans made no impression, while they were overlapped and\r\noutnumbered by the British right.\r\n\r\nFrom seven till nine o’clock Scott’s brigade hung on the British left\r\nand centre, charging repeatedly close on the enemy’s guns; and when at\r\nlast with the darkness their firing ceased from sheer exhaustion, they\r\nwere not yet beaten. Brady’s battalion, the Ninth and Twenty-second,\r\nand McNeil’s, the Eleventh, were broken up; their ammunition was\r\nexhausted, and most of their officers were killed or wounded. The\r\nEleventh and Twenty-second regiments lost two hundred and thirty men\r\nkilled, wounded, and missing, or more than half their number; many of\r\nthe men left the field, and only with difficulty could a battalion\r\nbe organized from the debris.[72] McNeil and Brady were wounded,\r\nand Major Leavenworth took command of the remnant. With a small and\r\nexhausted force which could not have numbered more than six hundred\r\nmen, and which Drummond by a vigorous movement might have wholly\r\ndestroyed, Scott clung to the enemy’s flank until in the darkness\r\nRipley’s brigade came down on the run. The American line was also\r\nreinforced by Porter’s brigade; by the First regiment, one hundred and\r\nfifty strong, which crossed from the American side of the river; and by\r\nRitchie’s and Biddle’s batteries.\r\n\r\nAt about the same time the rest of Riall’s force, twelve hundred and\r\nthirty rank-and-file, with two more six-pound guns, appeared on the\r\nfield, and were placed in a second line or used to prolong the British\r\nright. If Scott had lost four hundred men from the ranks Drummond\r\nhad certainly lost no more, for his men were less exposed. Brown was\r\nobliged to leave details of men for camp duty; Drummond brought three\r\nthousand rank-and-file on the field. At nine o’clock Drummond could\r\nscarcely have had fewer than twenty-six hundred men in Lundy’s Lane,\r\nwith seven field-pieces, two of which were twenty-four-pounders. Brown\r\ncould scarcely have had nineteen hundred, even allowing Porter to\r\nhave brought five hundred of his volunteers into battle.[73] He had\r\nalso Towson’s, Ritchie’s, and Biddle’s batteries,--seven twelve-pound\r\nfield-pieces in all.\r\n\r\nAs long as the British battery maintained its fire in the centre,\r\nvictory was impossible and escape difficult.[74] Ripley’s brigade alone\r\ncould undertake the task of capturing the British guns, and to it the\r\norder was given. Colonel Miller was to advance with the Twenty-first\r\nregiment against the British battery in front.[75] Ripley himself took\r\ncommand of the Twenty-third regiment on the right, to lead it by the\r\nroad to attack the enemy’s left flank in Lundy’s Lane. According to\r\nthe story that for the next fifty years was told to every American\r\nschool-boy as a model of modest courage, General Brown gave to Miller\r\nthe order to carry the enemy’s artillery, and Miller answered, “I’ll\r\ntry!”[76]\r\n\r\nThe two regiments thus thrown on the enemy’s centre and left numbered\r\nprobably about seven hundred men in the ranks, according to Ripley’s\r\nbelief. The Twenty-first regiment was the stronger, and may have\r\ncontained four hundred and fifty men, including officers; the\r\nTwenty-third could scarcely have brought three hundred into the field.\r\nIn a few minutes both battalions were in motion. The Twenty-third,\r\nadvancing along the road on the right, instantly attracted the enemy’s\r\nfire at about one hundred and fifty yards from the hill, and was thrown\r\nback. Ripley reformed the column, and in five minutes it advanced\r\nagain.[77] While the Twenty-third was thus engaged on the right, the\r\nTwenty-first silently advanced in front, covered by shrubbery and the\r\ndarkness, within a few rods of the British battery undiscovered, and\r\nwith a sudden rush carried the guns, bayoneting the artillery-men where\r\nthey stood.\r\n\r\nSo superb a feat of arms might well startle the British general, who\r\ncould not see that less than five hundred men were engaged in it;\r\nbut according to the British account[78] the guns stood immediately\r\nin front of a British line numbering at least twenty-six hundred men\r\nin ranks along Lundy’s Lane. Drummond himself must have been near\r\nthe spot, for the whole line of battle was but five minutes’ walk;\r\napparently he had but to order an advance, to drive Miller’s regiment\r\nback without trouble. Yet Miller maintained his ground until Ripley\r\ncame up on his right. According to the evidence of Captain McDonald\r\nof Ripley’s staff, the battle was violent during fifteen or twenty\r\nminutes:--\r\n\r\n   “Having passed the position where the artillery had been\r\n   planted, Colonel Miller again formed his line facing the enemy,\r\n   and engaged them within twenty paces distance. There appeared\r\n   a perfect sheet of fire between the two lines. While the\r\n   Twenty-first was in this situation, the Twenty-third attacked\r\n   the enemy’s flank, and advanced within twenty paces of it before\r\n   the first volley was discharged,--a measure adopted by command\r\n   of General Ripley, that the fire might be effectual and more\r\n   completely destructive. The movement compelled the enemy’s flank\r\n   to fall back immediately by descending the hill out of sight,\r\n   upon which the firing ceased.”[79]\r\n\r\nPerhaps this feat was more remarkable than the surprise of the\r\nbattery. Ripley’s Twenty-third regiment, about three hundred men,\r\nbroke the British line, not in the centre but on its left, where\r\nthe Eighty-ninth, the Royal Scots, King’s, and the Forty-first\r\nwere stationed,[80] and caused them to retire half a mile from the\r\nbattle-field before they halted to reform.\r\n\r\nWhen the firing ceased, Ripley’s brigade held the hill-top, with the\r\nBritish guns, and the whole length of Lundy’s Lane to the high-road.\r\nPorter then brought up his brigade on the left; Hindman brought up his\r\nguns, and placed Towson’s battery on Ripley’s right, Ritchie’s on his\r\nleft, while Biddle’s two guns were put in position on the road near the\r\ncorner of Lundy’s Lane. Jesup with the Twenty-fifth regiment was put in\r\nline on the right of Towson’s battery; Leavenworth with the remnants of\r\nthe Ninth, Eleventh, and Twenty-second formed a second line in the rear\r\nof the captured artillery; and thus reversing the former British order\r\nof battle, the little army stood ranked along the edge of Lundy’s Lane,\r\nwith the British guns in their rear.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    PLAN OF THE\r\n    BATTLE\r\n    OF\r\n    LUNDY’S LANE\r\n    10 O’CLOCK\r\n\r\n    STRUTHERS & CO., ENGR’S, N.Y.]\r\n\r\nThe British force was then in much confusion, a part of it marching\r\ninto the American line by mistake, and suffering a destructive fire;\r\na part of it firing into the regiment on its own right, and keeping up\r\nthe fire persistently.[81] In order to recover their artillery they\r\nmust assault, without guns, a steep hill held by an enemy with several\r\nfield-pieces. Had Brown been able to put a reserve of only a few\r\nhundred men into the field, his victory was assured; but the battle and\r\nexhaustion were rapidly reducing his force. He had at ten o’clock not\r\nmore than fifteen hundred men in the ranks, and almost every officer\r\nwas wounded.\r\n\r\nAfter a long interval the British line was reformed, and brought to\r\nthe attack. General Drummond’s report said nothing of this movement,\r\nbut according to the American account the two lines were closely\r\nengaged their whole length at a distance of ten or twelve yards. In\r\nthe darkness the troops could aim only at the flash of the muskets.\r\n“We having much the advantage of the ground, the enemy generally\r\nfired over our heads,” said Captain McDonald of Ripley’s staff; “but\r\nthe continual blaze of light was such as to enable us distinctly to\r\nsee their buttons.” After a sharp combat of some twenty minutes the\r\nenemy retreated. Three times, at intervals of half an hour or more,\r\nthe British line moved up the hill, and after the exchange of a hot\r\nfire retired; between the attacks, for half an hour at a time, all was\r\ndarkness and silence, hardly interrupted by a breath of air. Brown\r\nand Scott were with Porter on the extreme left. In the centre, by\r\nthe captured cannon, Ripley sat on his horse, ten or twelve paces\r\nin rear of his line. Two bullets passed through his hat, but he was\r\nunhurt. Captain Ritchie was killed at his battery on the left; Jesup\r\nwas wounded on the right. Each attack sorely diminished the number\r\nof men in the ranks, until at the close of the third about seven\r\nhundred rank-and-file, with few officers, were believed to remain in\r\nposition.[82]\r\n\r\nScott, with Leavenworth’s consolidated battalion, after ranging\r\nsomewhat wildly the entire length of the line in the attempt to turn\r\nthe enemy’s flank, and receiving the fire of both armies, joined\r\nJesup’s Twenty-fifth regiment on the right, and was at last severely\r\nwounded.[83] At about the same time Brown was wounded on the extreme\r\nleft,[84] where Porter’s volunteers held the line. Major Leavenworth,\r\nwith the remnants of the first brigade, moving from the left to\r\nreinforce Jesup on the right after the third repulse of the enemy,\r\nmet Scott retiring from the field, and soon afterward was hailed by\r\nGeneral Brown, who was also returning to camp severely wounded. The\r\ntime was then about eleven o’clock, and every one felt that the army\r\nmust soon retreat.[85] Farther in the rear General Brown met Major\r\nHindman of the artillery, who was bringing up his spare ammunition\r\nwagons. Brown ordered Hindman to collect his artillery as well as he\r\ncould, and retire immediately; “we shall all march to camp.” He said\r\nthat they had done as much as they could do; that nearly all their\r\nofficers were killed or wounded; that he was himself wounded, and he\r\nthought it best to retire to camp. Hindman on arriving at the hill,\r\nfiring having wholly ceased, immediately began to withdraw the guns.\r\nRipley first learned the order to withdraw by discovering the artillery\r\nto be already gone.[86] Next came a peremptory order to collect the\r\nwounded and retire.[87] The order was literally obeyed. The enemy in\r\nno way molested the movement; and at about midnight the wearied troops\r\nmarched for camp, in as good order and with as much regularity as they\r\nhad marched to the battle-field.[88]\r\n\r\nHindman withdrew his own guns, and having with some difficulty procured\r\nhorses to haul off the British pieces, on returning to the hill after\r\nRipley’s withdrawal found the enemy again in possession, and some men\r\nand wagons captured.[89] He left the field at once, with the British in\r\npossession of their guns, and followed the retreating column.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General Drummond’s report of the battle, though silent as to\r\nthe repeated British repulses, declared that the Americans fought with\r\nuncommon gallantry:--\r\n\r\n   “In so determined a manner were the attacks directed against\r\n   our guns that our artillery-men were bayoneted by the enemy in\r\n   the act of loading, and the muzzles of the enemy’s guns were\r\n   advanced within a few yards of ours. The darkness of the night\r\n   during this extraordinary conflict occasioned several uncommon\r\n   incidents; our troops having for a moment been pushed back, some\r\n   of our guns remained for a few minutes in the enemy’s hands.”\r\n\r\nDrummond’s “few minutes” were three hours. According to the British\r\naccount, the One-Hundred-and-third regiment, with its two field-pieces,\r\narrived on the field just at nine, and “passed by mistake into the\r\ncentre of the American army now posted upon the hill.”[90] The regiment\r\n“fell back in confusion” and lost its two field-pieces, which were\r\ncaptured by Miller, with Riall’s five pieces. By British report, Miller\r\nwas at nine o’clock “in possession of the crest of the hill and of\r\nseven pieces of captured artillery.”[91] Drummond admitted that in\r\nretiring “about midnight” the Americans carried away one of his light\r\npieces, having limbered it up by mistake and leaving one of their own.\r\nDuring the entire action after nine o’clock Drummond did not fire a\r\ncannon, although, according to Canadian authority, the fighting was\r\ndesperate:--\r\n\r\n   “The officers of the army from Spain who have been engaged\r\n   in Upper Canada have acknowledged that they never saw such\r\n   determined charges as were made by the Americans in the late\r\n   actions.... In the action on the 25th July the Americans charged\r\n   to the very muzzles of our cannon, and actually bayoneted the\r\n   artillery-men who were at their guns. Their charges were not\r\n   once or twice only, but repeated and long, and the steadiness of\r\n   British soldiers alone could have withstood them.”[92]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE battle of Lundy’s Lane lasted five hours, and Drummond\r\nbelieved the American force to be five thousand men. In truth, at no\r\nmoment were two thousand American rank-and-file on the field.[93]\r\n“The loss sustained by the enemy in this severe action,” reported\r\nDrummond,[94] “cannot be estimated at less than fifteen hundred men,\r\nincluding several hundred prisoners left in our hands.” Drummond’s\r\nestimate of American losses, as of American numbers, was double the\r\nreality. Brown reported a total loss, certainly severe enough, of eight\r\nhundred and fifty-three men,--one hundred and seventy-one killed,\r\nfive hundred and seventy-two wounded, one hundred and ten missing.\r\nDrummond reported a total loss of eight hundred and seventy-eight\r\nmen,--eighty-four killed, five hundred and fifty-nine wounded, one\r\nhundred and ninety-three missing, and forty-two prisoners. On both\r\nsides the battle was murderous. Brown and Scott were both badly\r\nwounded, the latter so severely that he could not resume his command\r\nduring the war. Drummond and Riall were also wounded. On both sides,\r\nbut especially on the American, the loss in officers was very great.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the British artillery on Scott’s brigade, while daylight\r\nlasted, had been excessive, while at that period of the battle the\r\nBritish could have suffered comparatively little. Among Scott’s\r\nbattalions the severest loss was that of Brady’s Twenty-second\r\nregiment, from Pennsylvania,--at the opening of the campaign two\r\nhundred and twenty-eight strong, officers and men. After Lundy’s Lane\r\nthe Twenty-second reported thirty-six killed, ninety wounded, and\r\nseventeen missing. The Ninth, Leavenworth’s Massachusetts regiment,\r\nwhich was returned as numbering three hundred and forty-eight officers\r\nand men June 31, reported sixteen killed, ninety wounded, and fifteen\r\nmissing at Lundy’s Lane. The Eleventh, McNeil’s Vermont battalion,\r\nwhich numbered three hundred and four officers and men June 30,\r\nreturned twenty-eight killed, one hundred and two wounded, and three\r\nmissing. The Twenty-fifth, Jesup’s Connecticut corps, numbering\r\nthree hundred and seventy officers and men at the outset, reported\r\ntwenty-eight killed, sixty-six wounded, and fifteen missing. These four\r\nregiments, composing Scott’s brigade, numbered thirteen hundred and\r\neighty-eight officers and men June 30, and lost in killed, wounded,\r\nand missing at Lundy’s Lane five hundred and six men, after losing two\r\nhundred and fifty-seven at Chippawa.\r\n\r\nRipley’s brigade suffered less; but although, after the British guns\r\nwere captured, the Americans were exposed only to musketry fire, the\r\nbrigades of Ripley and Porter reported a loss of two hundred and\r\nfifty-eight men, killed, wounded, and missing. The three artillery\r\ncompanies suffered a loss of forty-five men, including Captain Ritchie.\r\nThe total loss of eight hundred and fifty-three men was as nearly as\r\npossible one third of the entire army, including the unengaged pickets\r\nand other details.\r\n\r\nWhen Ripley, following the artillery, arrived in camp toward one\r\no’clock in the morning,[95] Brown sent for him, and gave him an\r\norder to return at day-break to the battle-field with all the force\r\nhe could collect, “and there to meet and beat the enemy if he again\r\nappeared.”[96] The order was impossible to execute. The whole force\r\ncapable of fighting another battle did not exceed fifteen or sixteen\r\nhundred effectives, almost without officers, and exhausted by the\r\nnight battle.[97] The order was given at one o’clock in the morning;\r\nthe army must employ the remainder of the night to reorganize its\r\nbattalions and replace its officers, and was expected to march at four\r\no’clock to regain a battle-field which Brown had felt himself unable\r\nto maintain at midnight, although he then occupied it, and held all\r\nthe enemy’s artillery. The order was futile. Major Leavenworth of\r\nthe Ninth regiment, who though wounded commanded the first brigade\r\nafter the disability of Scott, Brady, Jesup, and McNeil, thought it\r\n“the most consummate folly to attempt to regain possession of the\r\nfield of battle,” and declared that every officer he met thought like\r\nhimself.[98]\r\n\r\nYet Ripley at dawn began to collect the troops, and after the\r\ninevitable delay caused by the disorganization, marched at nine\r\no’clock, with about fifteen hundred men, to reconnoitre the enemy. At\r\nabout the same time Drummond advanced a mile, and took position in\r\norder of battle near the Falls, his artillery in the road, supported by\r\na column of infantry. A month earlier Drummond, like Riall, would have\r\nattacked, and with a force greater by one half could hardly have failed\r\nto destroy Ripley’s shattered regiments; but Chippawa and Lundy’s Lane\r\nhad already produced an effect on the British army. Drummond believed\r\nthat the Americans numbered five thousand, and his own force in the\r\nranks was about twenty-two hundred men. He allowed Ripley to retire\r\nunmolested, and remained at the Falls the whole day.\r\n\r\nRipley returned to camp at noon and made his report to Brown. The\r\nquestion requiring immediate decision was whether to maintain or\r\nabandon the line of the Chippawa River. Much could be said on both\r\nsides, and only officers on the spot could decide with certainty how\r\nthe enemy could be placed under most disadvantage, and how the army\r\ncould be saved from needless dangers. Ripley, cautious by nature,\r\nrecommended a retreat to Fort Erie. With the assent, as he supposed, of\r\nBrown and Porter,[99] Ripley immediately broke up the camp at Chippawa,\r\nand began the march to Fort Erie, sixteen miles in the rear. Although\r\ncomplaint was made of the retreat as confused, hasty, and unnecessary,\r\nit was conducted with no more loss or confusion than usual in such\r\nmovements,[100] and its military propriety was to be judged by its\r\neffects on the campaign.\r\n\r\nThe same evening, July 26, the army arrived at Fort Erie and camped.\r\nBrown was taken from Chippawa across the river to recover from his\r\nwound. Scott was also removed to safe quarters. Ripley was left with\r\nthe remains of the army camped on a plain, outside the unfinished\r\nbastions of Fort Erie, where the destruction of his entire force\r\nwas inevitable in case of a reverse. Ripley favored a withdrawal\r\nof the army to the American side; but Brown, from his sick bed at\r\nBuffalo, rejected the idea of a retreat, and fortunately Drummond’s\r\nreinforcements arrived slowly. The worst result of the difference\r\nin opinion was to make Brown harsh toward Ripley, who--although\r\nhis record was singular in showing only patient, excellent, and\r\nuniformly successful service--leaned toward caution, while Brown and\r\nScott thought chiefly of fighting. The combination produced admirable\r\nresults; but either officer alone might have failed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    PLAN\r\n\r\n    of the Attack and Defence\r\n    of Fort Erie,\r\n\r\n    By JN. LE BRETON, LT. DY. AG. Q. M.\r\n    GEN’L.\r\n\r\n    _Ms. British Archives._\r\n\r\n    STRUTHERS & CO., ENGR’S, N.Y.]\r\n\r\nDistrusting Ripley, and angry at losing the British cannon at Lundy’s\r\nLane as well as at the retreat from Chippawa, Brown wrote, August 7,\r\nto the Secretary of War a report containing an improper implication,\r\nwhich he afterward withdrew, that Ripley was wanting either in courage\r\nor capacity.[101] He also summoned Brigadier-General Gaines from\r\nSackett’s Harbor to command the army.[102] Gaines arrived, and as\r\nsenior brigadier assumed command at Fort Erie, August 4, while Ripley\r\nresumed command of his brigade. During the week that elapsed before\r\nGaines’s arrival, the army, under Ripley’s orders, worked energetically\r\nto intrench itself in lines behind Fort Erie; and after Gaines took\r\ncommand the same work was continued without interruption or change of\r\nplan, under the direction of Major McRee, Major Wood, and Lieutenant\r\nDouglass of the Engineers.\r\n\r\nThe result was chiefly decided by Drummond’s errors. Had he followed\r\nRipley closely, and had he attacked instantly on overtaking the\r\nretreating army at Fort Erie or elsewhere, he would have had the\r\nchances in his favor. Had he crossed the river and moved against\r\nBuffalo, he would have obliged Brown to order the instant evacuation of\r\nFort Erie, and would have recovered all the British positions without\r\nthe loss of a man. Drummond took neither course. He waited two days at\r\nChippawa before he moved up the river within two miles of Fort Erie.\r\nAbout August 1 his reinforcements arrived,--DeWatteville’s regiment\r\nfrom Kingston, and the Forty-first from Fort George,--replacing\r\nhis losses, and giving him three thousand one hundred and fifty\r\nrank-and-file;[103] but he seemed still undecided what course to\r\nadopt. The battles of Chippawa and Lundy’s Lane had given the British\r\narmy respect for American troops, and Drummond hesitated to assault\r\nthe unfinished works at Fort Erie, although he was fully one half\r\nstronger in men than Gaines and Ripley, who had barely two thousand\r\nrank-and-file after obtaining such reinforcements as were at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n       _Strength of Scott’s Brigade, Fort Erie, July 31, 1814._\r\n\r\n                                PRESENT FOR DUTY.

The effect of the rifles was so deadly that\r\nthe British troops refused to face them, and Tucker returned after\r\nlosing twenty-five men. This repulse, as creditable in its way to the\r\nAmerican army as the battles at Chippawa and Lundy’s Lane, caused much\r\nannoyance to Drummond, who issued an order, August 5, expressing “the\r\nindignation excited by discovering that the failure of an expedition,\r\nthe success of which... would have compelled the enemy’s forces to\r\nsurrender or... encounter certain defeat, was attributable to the\r\nmisbehavior of the troops employed.”[106] The only success achieved by\r\nBritish detachments was the cutting out of two American schooners which\r\ncovered the approach to Fort Erie, near the shore.\r\n\r\nDrummond having decided not to assault the lines of Fort Erie until\r\nhe had made an impression on the works, next sent for guns of heavy\r\ncalibre.[107] Ten days were passed in opening trenches and constructing\r\nbatteries. Gaines and Ripley employed the time in completing their\r\ndefences. Of these, the so-called Fort Erie was the smallest part,\r\nand made only the salient angle toward Drummond’s approaches. As the\r\nBritish had constructed the fort, it was a small, unfinished work,\r\nabout one hundred and fifty yards from the Lake-shore, open in the\r\nrear, and mounting three guns. The American engineers completed its\r\nrear bastions, and constructed an earthwork seven feet high, with a\r\nditch, to the shore, where a small stone-work completed the defence on\r\nthat side, and brought the lines to the water’s edge. The stone-work\r\nwas called the Douglass battery, after the lieutenant of engineers who\r\nbuilt it. Fort Erie, Battery Douglass, and their connecting breastwork\r\nsecured the camp on the right. A similar breastwork, nearly at right\r\nangles with the first, was extended three hundred and fifty yards\r\nwestward parallel with the Lake-shore, then turning slightly ran three\r\nhundred and fifty yards farther till it neared the Lake-shore, where\r\nit was finished on Snake Hill by a projecting battery called Towson’s.\r\nTraverses were constructed, and a strongly intrenched camp, about seven\r\nhundred yards by two hundred and fifty, was thus formed, open on its\r\nrear to the Lake.\r\n\r\nHindman had general charge of the artillery. Battery Douglass mounted\r\none gun; another was mounted on the neighboring line; Fort Erie\r\ncontained six,[108] under Captain Williams; Biddle’s and Fanning’s\r\n(Ritchie’s) four guns were placed on the long line in the front; and\r\nTowson had six field-pieces at the extreme left.[109] Scott’s brigade,\r\ncommanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Aspinwall, was posted on the right;\r\nPorter’s volunteers and the First Rifles occupied the centre; and\r\nRipley with the Twenty-first and Twenty-third regiments defended the\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nDrummond opened with six guns, August 13, and prepared for assault the\r\nfollowing day. His arrangements were somewhat complicated. He divided\r\nthe attacking force into three columns, retaining another division in\r\nreserve. The strongest column, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Fischer\r\nof DeWatteville’s regiment, was composed of portions of four regular\r\nregiments, and numbered about thirteen hundred men; these were to\r\nassault Towson and Ripley on Snake Hill. The centre column, commanded\r\nby Lieutenant-Colonel Drummond of the One-Hundred-and-fourth, numbered\r\nonly one hundred and ninety rank-and-file, including a party of seamen\r\nand marines;[110] these were to attack Fort Erie. The third column,\r\nunder Colonel Scott of the One-Hundred-and-third regiment, numbered six\r\nhundred and fifty rank-and-file; these were to assault the breastworks\r\nbetween Fort Erie and Battery Douglass.[111] According to these\r\nnumbers, Drummond meant to assault with twenty-one hundred and forty\r\nrank-and-file, or about twenty-four hundred men all told. His reserve\r\nnumbered one thousand men.[112] Some further number must have been\r\ndetailed in camp duty.\r\n\r\nDrummond’s instructions, dated August 14, to Colonel Fischer were\r\nminute.[113] Fischer’s column was to march immediately, in order to\r\npass through the woods before dark, and halt for the night opposite\r\nthe point of attack, with every precaution against discovery:--\r\n\r\n   “You are to advance to the attack precisely at two o’clock. You\r\n   are to enter the enemy’s position betwixt Snake Hill and the\r\n   Lake, which is represented to be sufficiently open; but this\r\n   is not to prevent your making your arrangements for assaulting\r\n   any other part of the position by means of the short ladders\r\n   and hay-bags with which you will be furnished. In order to\r\n   _insure success_, the Lieutenant-General most strongly\r\n   recommends that the flints be taken out of the firelocks, with\r\n   the exception of a reserve of select and steady men who may be\r\n   permitted to retain their flints, if you think it necessary or\r\n   advisable, not exceeding one third of your force. This reserve,\r\n   with the detachment of artillery, should take post on Snake\r\n   Hill.”\r\n\r\nA demonstration was to be made a few minutes before two o’clock against\r\nthe American pickets opposite the centre of the line.\r\n\r\nDrummond’s general orders concluded by encouraging his men to consider\r\ntheir task easy:[114]--\r\n\r\n   “The Lieutenant-General most strongly recommends a free use of\r\n   the bayonet. The enemy’s force does not exceed fifteen hundred\r\n   fit for duty, and those are represented as much dispirited.”\r\n\r\nThe British general under-estimated Gaines’s force, which probably\r\ncontained at least two thousand rank-and-file fit for duty August 14,\r\nwho though possibly overworked and inclined to grumble, were ready to\r\nfight. Neither Gaines nor Ripley, nor any of the excellent officers\r\nof engineers and artillery who defended the lines of Fort Erie, were\r\nlikely to allow themselves to be surprised or even approached by a\r\nforce no greater than their own without ample resistance. They kept\r\nstrong pickets far in advance of their lines, and were alive to every\r\nsign of attack. Soon after midnight of August 14 the fire of the\r\nBritish siege-guns slackened and ceased. At the same moment Gaines\r\nleft his quarters and Ripley ordered his brigade to turn out. Both\r\nofficers looked for an assault, and were not mistaken. At two o’clock\r\nthe pickets fired and fell back, and at half-past two o’clock Colonel\r\nFischer’s advancing column moved against Snake Hill.\r\n\r\nThere at the breastworks were Towson’s guns and the Twenty-first\r\nregiment commanded by Major Wood of the Engineers, only two hundred\r\nand fifty strong, but as steady as at Lundy’s Lane.[115] A part of\r\nFischer’s brigade marched gallantly up to the abattis, bayonets\r\ncharged and guns without flints, and approached within ten feet of the\r\nbreastwork, but failed to reach it. The other column, DeWatteville’s\r\nregiment at its head, “marching too near the Lake,” according to\r\nColonel Fischer’s report,[116] “found themselves entangled between\r\nthe rocks and the water, and by the retreat of the flank companies\r\nwere thrown in such confusion as to render it impossible to give them\r\nany kind of formation during the darkness of the night, at which time\r\nthey were exposed to a most galling fire of the enemy’s battery.” A\r\npart of De Watteville’s regiment waded through the water round the\r\nAmerican line, and came into the camp on the flank, but found there two\r\ncompanies posted to meet such an attempt, and were all captured, so\r\nthat Colonel Fischer, writing his report the next day, seemed ignorant\r\nwhat had become of them.\r\n\r\nThe attack and repulse of Colonel Fischer on the extreme American\r\nleft were soon over, and the story was easy to understand; but the\r\nattack on Fort Erie and the extreme right was neither quickly ended\r\nnor easily understood. There a column of more than seven hundred men,\r\nall told, under Colonel Scott of the One-Hundred-and-third, was to\r\nattack the Douglass battery. Another column, numbering somewhat more\r\nthan two hundred men, all told, under Lieutenant-Colonel Drummond of\r\nthe One-Hundred-and-fourth, was to assault Fort Erie. The American\r\nline between Battery Douglass and Fort Erie was held by the Ninth\r\nregiment and the volunteers, and was covered by the battery. Fort Erie\r\nwas defended by about one hundred and eighteen men of the Nineteenth\r\nregiment under Major Trimble, and about sixty artillerists[117] under\r\nCaptain Williams.\r\n\r\nThe most intelligible account of the battle at the eastern end of the\r\nlines was given neither in Gaines’s nor Drummond’s reports, but in some\r\ncharges afterward brought against Gaines by Major Trimble, who was\r\nangry at the language of Gaines’s report. Trimble’s charges were judged\r\nto be frivolous, but his story of the battle was more precise than any\r\nother.\r\n\r\nAccording to Major Trimble, Lieutenant-Colonel Drummond’s column was\r\ndirected against the north curtain of the fort, and was repulsed, but\r\ncontinued the assault. Colonel Scott’s column at the same time advanced\r\nwithin about sixty yards of the Douglass battery, but deterred by\r\nthe fire of the guns served under the direction of Major McRee and\r\nLieutenant Douglass of the Engineers, and by the loss of its commanding\r\nofficer Colonel Scott, who fell before the American line, the column\r\nmoved quickly to the right, gained the ditch of the northeast bastion\r\nof Fort Erie, and under cover of the smoke and darkness entered the\r\nbastion. There they were joined by Drummond’s men. They surprised\r\nthe artillerists, and in the scuffle Captain Williams and his\r\nlieutenants--McDonough, Fontaine, and Watmough--were killed or disabled.\r\n\r\nWithout support the British columns could do no more, and\r\nLieutenant-General Drummond did not come to their support. None of the\r\nreports mentioned the time at which the bastion was captured; but the\r\nsmall British force, which could not have exceeded six or seven hundred\r\nmen, remained for more than two hours in or about the bastion, exposed\r\nto the American fire, to which they could not reply with effect,\r\nand waiting for Drummond and the reserve, which the Americans also\r\nexpected and trained their guns to enfilade. The British in the bastion\r\nrepeatedly attempted to advance from the bastion to gain possession of\r\nthe Fort, and twice tried to force the door of the stone mess-house\r\nfrom which the men of the Nineteenth regiment kept up a destructive\r\nfire. They repulsed the attacks made by reinforcements ordered by\r\nGaines into the Fort to recover the bastion; yet their destruction was\r\ninevitable as soon as the dawn should arrive, for they could neither\r\nadvance nor escape, nor remain where they were, under the guns of the\r\ngarrison.\r\n\r\nAfter maintaining themselves till five o’clock in this difficult\r\nposition, the British soldiers and sailors in the bastion were\r\npanic-struck by the explosion of an ammunition-chest under the\r\nplatform. According to General Drummond’s official report, “Some\r\nammunition, which had been placed under the platform, caught fire\r\nfrom the firing of guns in the rear, and a most tremendous explosion\r\nfollowed, by which almost all the troops which had entered the place\r\nwere dreadfully mangled. Panic was instantly communicated to the\r\ntroops, who could not be persuaded that the explosion was accidental;\r\nand the enemy at the same time pressing forward and commencing a heavy\r\nfire of musketry, the Fort was abandoned, and our troops retreated\r\ntoward the battery.”\r\n\r\nThe explosion merely hastened the rout. Probably the attacking\r\ncolumns would have fared still worse, had they remained. Even their\r\npanic-stricken flight saved only a remnant. Of Drummond’s column,\r\nsaid to number one hundred and ninety rank-and-file, one hundred and\r\neighty-eight officers and men were reported as missing, wounded,\r\nor killed. Of Scott’s column, said to number six hundred and fifty\r\nrank-and-file,--the Royal Scots and the One-Hundred-and-third\r\nregiments,--four hundred and ninety-six officers and men were returned\r\nas killed, wounded, or missing. Of the whole rank-and-file engaged\r\nunder Fischer, Scott, and Drummond, numbering two thousand one hundred\r\nand fifty men, if the British report was correct, seven hundred and\r\neighty were officially reported among the casualties. The loss in\r\nofficers was equally severe. Colonel Scott was killed before the lines.\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Drummond was killed in the bastion. One major, ten\r\ncaptains, and fifteen lieutenants were killed, wounded, or missing. The\r\ntotal British loss was nine hundred and five among some twenty-four\r\nhundred engaged. The total American loss was eighty-four men.[118]\r\n\r\nGeneral Drummond was excessively mortified by his failure, in truth the\r\nseverest blow that British arms could suffer at that moment. For the\r\nfourth time in six weeks a large body of British troops met a bloody\r\nand unparalleled check, if not rout, from an inferior force. In a\r\nprivate letter to Prevost, dated August 16, Drummond attributed the\r\ndisaster to the misconduct of DeWatteville’s regiment, a foreign corps,\r\nwhich was struck by panic:[119]--\r\n\r\n   “It appears that part of the forlorn hope and about half of\r\n   Watteville’s Light Company, by wading through the water,\r\n   though the footing was excessively rough and rocky along the\r\n   Lake-shore, turned the left flank of an abattis which extended\r\n   from the enemy’s battery on Snake Hill, the left of their\r\n   position, to the Lake, and part penetrated through the abattis\r\n   itself, and thereby gained the rear of the enemy’s works. The\r\n   fire of the enemy at this time being extremely heavy both from\r\n   artillery and musketry, it would seem as if a simultaneous shock\r\n   of panic pervaded the greater part of those not in immediate\r\n   advance; and the forlorn hope, not finding itself sufficiently\r\n   supported, was reluctantly under the necessity of relinquishing\r\n   the advantages they had gained, and of retiring again through\r\n   the water under a most galling fire. They lost many men, and\r\n   DeWatteville’s Light Company nearly half their number. The\r\n   Light Company of the Eighty-ninth, notwithstanding they were\r\n   almost overwhelmed by the grenadiers of DeWatteville in the\r\n   precipitancy of their retreat, was the only body that preserved\r\n   its order and remained firm upon its ground. By this act of\r\n   steadiness they fortunately lost scarcely a man. The main body\r\n   of DeWatteville’s regiment retreated in such confusion that they\r\n   carried the King’s regiment before them like a torrent. Thus by\r\n   the misconduct of this foreign corps has the opportunity been\r\n   totally lost.”\r\n\r\nThe mortification of Drummond was acute in having to charge both his\r\nattacking columns with being panic-stricken: “The agony of mind I\r\nsuffer from the present disgraceful and unfortunate conduct of the\r\ntroops committed to my superintendence, wounds me to the soul!” Yet\r\nhe offered no evidence to show that his troops fled before they were\r\nbeaten, nor did he explain why he had thought it useless to order\r\nthe reserve to their support after they had captured the bastion. In\r\nreality the battle of Fort Erie was more creditable to the British than\r\nthe battles of Chippawa or Lundy’s Lane, and the Americans could not\r\nadmit that in either of the three the conduct of Drummond’s troops was\r\n“disgraceful.”\r\n\r\nThe defeat so much weakened Drummond that he could no longer keep\r\nthe field without support, and immediately sent for two more\r\nregiments,--the Sixth and the Eighty-second from Burlington and\r\nYork,--numbering about one thousand and forty rank-and-file, and making\r\ngood his losses.[120]\r\n\r\nAt that time Chauncey was in control of Lake Ontario. The anxieties and\r\ndelays in fitting out his new ship had ended in a fever, under which\r\nhe was still suffering when he received General Brown’s challenge of\r\nJuly 13 to meet him opposite Fort George. Chauncey did not immediately\r\nreply except by message through General Gaines. July 31, everything\r\nbeing at last ready, he was carried on board his ship, and the next\r\nday he sailed, arriving August 5 off Fort George. Brown’s army was then\r\nbesieged in Fort Erie, and could not approach the fleet. This situation\r\ngave to Chauncey the opportunity of writing a letter to Brown, repaying\r\nthe harshness that Brown had shown to him.\r\n\r\n   “Was it friendly or just or honorable,” asked Chauncey,[121]\r\n   “not only to furnish an opening for the public, but thus to\r\n   assist them to infer that I had pledged myself to meet you on\r\n   a particular day at the head of the Lake, for the purpose of\r\n   co-operation, and in case of disaster to your army, thus to turn\r\n   their resentment from you, who are alone responsible, upon me,\r\n   who could not by any possibility have prevented, or retarded\r\n   even, your discomfiture? You well know, sir, that the fleet\r\n   could not have rendered you the least service during your late\r\n   incursion upon Upper Canada. You have not been able to approach\r\n   Lake Ontario on any point nearer than Queenston.”\r\n\r\nBrown’s quarrel with Chauncey made much noise in its day, and, like\r\nthe less defensible quarrel with Ripley, proved that Brown was\r\nunnecessarily aggressive; but in the situation of the United States,\r\naggressiveness was the most valuable quality in the service. That Brown\r\nmight have become a great general was possible, had his experience been\r\nlarger; but whatever was his merit as a general, his qualities as a\r\nfighter were more remarkable than those of any other general officer in\r\nthe war. Except immediately after receiving his wound at Lundy’s Lane,\r\nwhen his army was exhausted by four hours of extreme effort, he never\r\nseemed satiated with fighting. Among all the American major-generals,\r\nhe alone made raw troops as steady as grenadiers, and caused militia to\r\nstorm entrenched lines held by British regulars.\r\n\r\nBrown might have been well satisfied to let Drummond exhaust his\r\nstrength in attacking Fort Erie. From a military point of view, Fort\r\nErie was worthless for any other purpose than to draw the enemy to the\r\nextreme end of their line, where they could with difficulty obtain\r\nsupplies, and could take no part in the serious campaigning intended on\r\nLake Champlain. For that object, no more pitched battles were needed.\r\nDrummond’s force was wasting away by sickness and exposure.[122]\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of August 15, the British continued to bombard Fort\r\nErie. No great damage was done; but a shell exploded in Gaines’s\r\nquarters August 29, injuring him severely and obliging him to\r\nrelinquish command. Brown was still unfit for service, but was bent\r\nupon more fighting, and knew that Ripley preferred to abandon Fort Erie\r\naltogether. Accordingly he resumed command at Buffalo, September 2, and\r\nset himself to study the situation.\r\n\r\nThe situation was uncomfortable, but in no way perilous. The lines\r\nof Fort Erie were stronger than ever, and beyond danger of capture\r\nfrom any British force that could be brought to assault them, until\r\nDrummond should discover some new means of supplying troops with\r\nsubsistence. The army return of August 31 gave the precise strength of\r\nthe garrison.\r\n\r\n\r\n          _Strength of the Army at Fort Erie, Aug. 31, 1814._\r\n\r\n                                  PRESENT FOR DUTY.

Sooner or later the British would be obliged to\r\nretreat; and Brown was informed by deserters that Drummond was then\r\ncontemplating withdrawal.[124] Brown estimated the British force very\r\nloosely at three or four thousand;[125] and it was in fact about the\r\nsmaller number.\r\n\r\nDrummond’s situation was told in his reports to Sir George Prevost.\r\nSeptember 8 be wrote[126] that he should not fail to seize any\r\nfavorable opportunity to attack; “but should no such opportunity\r\npresent itself, I feel it incumbent on me to prepare your Excellency\r\nfor the possibility of my being compelled by sickness or suffering\r\nof the troops, exposed as they will be to the effects of the wet and\r\nunhealthy season which is fast approaching, to withdraw them from their\r\npresent position to one which may afford them the means of cover.\r\nSickness has, I am sorry to say, already made its appearance in several\r\nof the corps.” Three days afterward, September 11,[127] Drummond was\r\nwarned by several signs that his lines were to be attacked by Brown,\r\nalthough “whether the account which is _invariably_ given by\r\ndeserters of his intention to act offensively ... be correct, I have\r\nnot yet been able accurately to ascertain.” Drummond’s batteries\r\nhad been almost silent for several days for want of ammunition,\r\nand he could do nothing till the arrival of reinforcements,--the\r\nNinety-seventh regiment,--unaccountably delayed. Rain had begun, and he\r\ndreaded its effect on the troops. In his next despatch, dated September\r\n14,[128] he said that the rain had been incessant, and “as the whole of\r\nthe troops are without tents, and the huts in which they are placed\r\nare wholly incapable of affording shelter against such severe weather,\r\ntheir situation is most distressing.” The roads were impassable; the\r\nnearest depot of supplies was Fort George, and Drummond had not cattle\r\nenough to move a third of his heavy ordnance if a sudden movement\r\nshould be necessary. The enemy seemed about to cross the river in his\r\nrear, and the Ninety-seventh regiment had not yet arrived:--\r\n\r\n   “In the mean time I have strong grounds for thinking that the\r\n   enemy will risk an attack,--an event which though from the\r\n   necessity of defending my batteries in the first instance with\r\n   the pickets alone I shall have to meet under every possible\r\n   disadvantage, yet I am very much disposed to hope may be the\r\n   most fortunate circumstance which can happen, as it will bring\r\n   us in contact with the enemy at a far cheaper rate than if we\r\n   were to be the assailants.”\r\n\r\nWhile Drummond struggled between the necessity of retreat and the\r\ndifficulty of retreating, Brown was bent on attacking his lines. The\r\nplan was open to grave objections, and a council of war, September 9,\r\ndiscouraged the idea. Brown was much disappointed and irritated at the\r\nresult of the council, especially with Ripley; but while giving the\r\nimpression that he acquiesced, he brought over all the volunteers he\r\ncould obtain.[129] The number was never precisely given, but according\r\nto the official reports of General Peter B. Porter who commanded them,\r\nand of General Brown himself, they did not exceed one thousand.[130]\r\nWith these, and an equal number of regular troops, Brown undertook to\r\nassault Drummond’s entrenchments.\r\n\r\nThe nearest British line was about six hundred yards from old Fort\r\nErie. From the first British battery on the Lake-shore, to Battery\r\nNo. 3 in the woods, the line extended nearly half a mile, covered by\r\nabattis, but defended only by the brigade of troops on actual duty. If\r\ncarried, the first line could not be held without capturing the second\r\nline, about fifty yards distant, and a third line, farther in the\r\nrear; while the main British force was encamped, for reasons of health\r\nand comfort, a mile behind, and was supposed to number at least three\r\nthousand six hundred men, or quite sufficient to recover their works.\r\nBrown professed no intention of fighting the British army. He proposed\r\nonly “to storm the batteries, destroy the cannon, and roughly handle\r\nthe brigade upon duty, before those in reserve could be brought into\r\naction.”[131]\r\n\r\nAlthough Drummond expected and wished to be attacked, he kept no\r\nproper pickets or scouts in the woods, and all day of September 16\r\nAmerican fatigue parties were at work opening a path through the forest\r\nthe distance of a mile, from Snake Hill on the extreme left to the\r\nextremity of the British line in the woods. So little precaution had\r\nDrummond’s engineers taken that they left the dense forest standing\r\nwithin pistol-shot of the flank and rear of their Battery No. 3 on\r\ntheir extreme right, and the American parties opened a path within one\r\nhundred and fifty yards of the flank of the British line without being\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nAt noon, September 17, General Porter led a column of sixteen hundred\r\nmen--of whom one thousand were militia volunteers, and a part were\r\nthe Twenty-third regiment--along the path through the woods, in three\r\ndivisions, commanded by Colonel Gibson of the Fourth Rifles, Colonel E.\r\nD. Wood of the Engineers, and Brigadier-General Davis of the New York\r\nmilitia. At three o’clock, under cover of heavy rain, the whole force\r\nfell suddenly on the blockhouse which covered the flank and rear of\r\nthe British battery No. 3, and succeeded in capturing the blockhouse\r\nand mastering the battery held by DeWatteville’s regiment. While\r\ndetachments spiked the guns and blew up the magazine, the main column\r\nadvanced on Battery No. 2, while at the same time General Miller,\r\npromoted to the command of Scott’s old brigade, moved with “the remains\r\nof the Ninth and Eleventh Infantry and a detachment of the Nineteenth”\r\nfrom a ravine in front of Battery No. 3 to pierce the centre of the\r\nBritish line between Battery No. 3 and Battery No. 2.[132]\r\n\r\nWithin half an hour after the first gun was fired, Porter and Miller\r\nhad effected their junction within the British lines, had captured\r\nBattery No. 2, and moved on Battery No. 1, by the Lake-shore. There the\r\nsuccess ended. Battery No. 1 could not be carried. By that time the\r\nRoyal Scots, the Eighty-ninth, the Sixth, and the Eighty-second British\r\nregiments had arrived,--probably about one thousand men.[133] A sharp\r\nengagement followed before Brown, after ordering his reserve under\r\nRipley to the assistance of Porter and Miller, could disengage his\r\ntroops. The three commanders of Porter’s divisions--Gibson, Wood, and\r\nDavis--were killed or mortally wounded,--Gibson at the second battery,\r\nDavis and Wood in assaulting the shore battery. Ripley was desperately\r\nwounded at the same time. General Porter, Lieutenant-Colonel Aspinwall\r\nof the Ninth, and Major Trimble of the Nineteenth, as well as a number\r\nof other officers, were severely wounded. That the last action was\r\nsharp was proved by the losses suffered by the British reinforcements.\r\nAccording to the British official return, the four regiments which\r\ncame last into the field--the Royal Scots, Sixth, Eighty-second, and\r\nEighty-ninth--lost thirty-six killed, one hundred and nine wounded, and\r\nfifty-four missing,--a total of two hundred men, in a short action of\r\nhalf an hour at the utmost, without artillery.\r\n\r\nThe American forces were recalled by Brown and Miller as soon as their\r\nprogress was stopped, and they retired without serious pursuit beyond\r\nthe British lines. Their losses were very severe, numbering five\r\nhundred and eleven killed, wounded, and missing, or about one fourth\r\nof their number. Among them were several of the best officers in the\r\nUnited States service, including Ripley, Wood, and Gibson. Drummond’s\r\nloss was still more severe, numbering six hundred and nine,[134]\r\nprobably almost one man in three of the number engaged. The British\r\nkilled numbered one hundred and fifteen. The Americans reported\r\nseventy-nine killed,--sixty regulars, and nineteen militia.\r\n\r\nThe next day Drummond issued a general order claiming a victory over an\r\nAmerican force of “not less than five thousand men, including militia;”\r\nbut his situation, untenable before the sortie, became impossible after\r\nit. Three out of six battering cannon were disabled;[135] he had lost\r\nsix hundred men in battle, and his losses by sickness were becoming\r\nenormous. “My effective numbers are reduced to considerably less than\r\ntwo thousand firelocks,” he reported, September 21. Immediately after\r\nthe sortie, although reinforced by the Ninety-seventh regiment, he made\r\nhis arrangements to retreat.\r\n\r\n   “Within the last few days,” he wrote to Prevost, September\r\n   21,[136] “the sickness of the troops has increased to such an\r\n   alarming degree, and their situation has really become one of\r\n   such extreme wretchedness from the torrents of rain which\r\n   have continued to fall for the last thirteen days, and from\r\n   the circumstance of the Division being entirely destitute of\r\n   camp-equipage, that I feel it my duty no longer to persevere in\r\n   a vain attempt to maintain the blockade of so vastly superior\r\n   and increasing a force of the enemy under such circumstances. I\r\n   have therefore given orders for the troops to fall back toward\r\n   the Chippawa, and shall commence my movement at eight o’clock\r\n   this evening.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEAK as was the army at Niagara, it was relatively stronger\r\nthan the defence at any other threatened point. Sackett’s Harbor\r\ncontained only seven hundred effectives.[137] On Lake Champlain,\r\nMajor-General Izard tried to cover Plattsburg and Burlington with about\r\nfive thousand regular troops.[138] Already Armstrong knew that large\r\nBritish reinforcements from Wellington’s army were on their way to\r\nCanada;[139] and within a few weeks after the battle of Lundy’s Lane\r\neleven thousand of the best troops England ever put in the field were\r\ncamped on or near the Sorel River, about to march against Izard’s five\r\nthousand raw recruits.\r\n\r\nThey could march nowhere else. Not only was the line of Lake\r\nChamplain the natural and necessary path of an invading army, but the\r\nimpossibility of supplying any large number of troops in Upper Canada\r\nmade Lake Champlain the only region in which a large British force\r\ncould exist. Sir George Prevost had reached the limit of his powers\r\nin defending Upper Canada. His commissary-general, W. H. Robinson,\r\nwrote to him, August 27, expressing “the greatest alarm” on account of\r\ndeficient supplies at Burlington Heights and Niagara, where instead of\r\nnine thousand rations daily as he expected, he was required to furnish\r\nfourteen thousand, half of them to Indians.[140] Much as Prevost\r\nwanted to attack Sackett’s Harbor, and weak as he knew that post to\r\nbe, he could not attempt it, although he had thirteen or fourteen\r\nthousand rank-and-file idle at Montreal. In October he went to Kingston\r\nexpressly to arrange such an attack, and found it impossible.\r\n\r\n   “An investigation of the state of the stores at this post,”\r\n   he wrote to Lord Bathurst October 18,[141] “proved that the\r\n   articles for the armament and equipment for a ship of the class\r\n   of the ‘St. Lawrence,’ carrying upward of one hundred guns,\r\n   had absorbed almost the whole of the summer transport-service\r\n   from Montreal, leaving the materials for an undertaking of the\r\n   magnitude of the destruction of Sackett’s Harbor still at the\r\n   extremity of the line of communication; and now, by giving\r\n   precedence to that supply of provisions and stores without\r\n   which an army is no longer to be maintained in Upper Canada,\r\n   its removal is inevitably postponed until the winter roads are\r\n   established.”\r\n\r\nNot only were military operations on a large scale impossible in Upper\r\nCanada, but for the opposite reason occupation of Lake Champlain by a\r\nBritish force was necessary. Northern New York and Vermont furnished\r\ntwo thirds of the fresh beef consumed by the British armies. General\r\nIzard reported to Armstrong, July 31,[142]--\r\n\r\n   “From the St. Lawrence to the ocean, an open disregard prevails\r\n   for the laws prohibiting intercourse with the enemy. The road to\r\n   St. Regis is covered with droves of cattle, and the river with\r\n   rafts, destined for the enemy. The revenue officers see these\r\n   things, but acknowledge their inability to put a stop to such\r\n   outrageous proceedings. On the eastern side of Lake Champlain\r\n   the high roads are found insufficient for the supplies of\r\n   cattle which are pouring into Canada. Like herds of buffaloes\r\n   they press through the forest, making paths for themselves....\r\n   Nothing but a cordon of troops from the French Mills to Lake\r\n   Memphramagog could effectually check the evil. Were it not\r\n   for these supplies, the British forces in Canada would soon\r\n   be suffering from famine, or their government be subjected to\r\n   enormous expense for their maintenance.”\r\n\r\nAfter Chauncey, August 1, regained possession of Lake Ontario, any\r\nBritish campaign against Sackett’s Harbor or Detroit became doubly\r\nimpossible, and the occupation of Lake Champlain became doubly\r\nnecessary. Prevost wrote to Bathurst, August 27,[143]--\r\n\r\n   “In fact, my Lord, two thirds of the army in Canada are at this\r\n   moment eating beef provided by American contractors, drawn\r\n   principally from the States of Vermont and New York. This\r\n   circumstance, as well as that of the introduction of large sums\r\n   in specie into this province, being notorious in the United\r\n   States, it is to be expected that Congress will take steps to\r\n   deprive us of those resources; and under that apprehension large\r\n   droves are daily crossing the lines coming into Lower Canada.”\r\n\r\nThe fear that Izard might at any moment take efficient measures to\r\ncut off the British supplies gave double force to the reasons for\r\noccupying Lake Champlain, and forcing the military frontier back beyond\r\nPlattsburg and Burlington.\r\n\r\nThe political reasons were not less strong or less notorious than\r\nthe military. England made no secret of her intention to rectify\r\nthe Canadian frontier by lopping away such territory as she could\r\nconquer. July 5, the day of the battle of Chippawa, Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nPilkington sailed from Halifax, and under the naval protection\r\nof Sir Thomas Hardy in the “Ramillies,” landed at Eastport, July\r\n11, with the One-Hundred-and-second regiment, some engineers and\r\nartillery,--a detachment of six hundred men,--and took possession of\r\nMoose Island.[144] Fort Sullivan, with six officers and eighty men,\r\ncapitulated, and Great Britain took permanent possession of the place.\r\n\r\nMoose Island was disputed territory, and its occupation was not\r\nnecessarily conquest; but the next step showed wider views. August 26,\r\nLieutenant-General Sir J. C. Sherbrooke, the British governor of Nova\r\nScotia, set sail from Halifax with a powerful fleet, carrying near two\r\nthousand troops, and arrived September 1 at the Penobscot.[145] At\r\nhis approach, the American garrison of the small battery at Castine\r\nblew up their fort and dispersed. In all Massachusetts, only about six\r\nhundred regular troops were to be found, and beyond the Penobscot, in\r\nSeptember, 1814, hardly a full company could have been collected. The\r\nable-bodied, voting, male population of the counties of Kennebeck and\r\nHancock, on either side of the Penobscot River, capable of bearing\r\narms, was at that time about twelve thousand, on an estimate of one in\r\nfive of the total population; but they offered no resistance to the\r\nBritish troops.\r\n\r\nOne misfortune led to another. A few days before Sherbrooke’s arrival\r\nat Castine the United States ship “Adams,” a heavy corvette carrying\r\ntwenty-eight guns, having escaped from Chesapeake Bay and cruised\r\nsome months at sea struck on a reef on the Isle of Haut, and was\r\nbrought into the Penobscot in a sinking condition. Captain Morris, who\r\ncommanded her, took the ship up the river about twenty-five miles, as\r\nfar as Hampden near Bangor, and removed her guns in order to repair\r\nher. Sherbrooke, on occupying Castine, sent a detachment of some\r\nsix hundred men in boats up the river to destroy the ship, while he\r\noccupied Belfast with another regiment.[146] Captain Morris hastily put\r\nhis guns in battery, and prepared to defend the ship with his crew,\r\nnumbering probably more than two hundred men, relying on the militia\r\nto cover his flanks. On the morning of September 3, in a thick fog,\r\nthe enemy’s boats approached and landed their infantry, which attacked\r\nand routed the militia, and obliged Captain Morris to set fire to the\r\n“Adams,” abandon his guns, and disperse his men.[147] The British force\r\nthen marched to Bangor, which they occupied without opposition. Their\r\nentire loss was one man killed and eight wounded.[148] At Bangor they\r\nremained nearly a week, destroying vessels and cargoes; but Sir John\r\nSherbrooke had no orders to occupy the country west of the Penobscot,\r\nand his troops returned September 9 to Castine.\r\n\r\nAt Castine the British remained, while another detachment occupied\r\nMachias. All the province of Maine east of the Penobscot was then in\r\nSherbrooke’s hands. The people formally submitted. One hundred miles\r\nof Massachusetts sea-coast passed quietly under the dominion of the\r\nKing of England. The male citizens were required to take, and took, the\r\noath of allegiance to King George,[149] and showed no unwillingness\r\nto remain permanently British subjects. After September 1 the United\r\nStates government had every reason to expect that Great Britain would\r\nrequire, as one condition of peace, a cession of the eastern and\r\nnorthern portions of Maine.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose the British needed also to occupy Lake Champlain, in\r\norder to make their conquests respectable. The British general might\r\nmove on Plattsburg or on Burlington; but in order to maintain his\r\nposition he must gain naval possession of the Lake. In such a case the\r\ndifficulties of the American government would be vastly increased,\r\nand the British position would be impregnable. Armstrong knew these\r\ncircumstances almost as well as they were known to Sir George Prevost.\r\n\r\nIn May the British flotilla entered Lake Champlain from the Sorel\r\nRiver, and cruised, May 9, as far southward as Otter Creek, terrifying\r\nVermont for the safety of the American flotilla under Lieutenant Thomas\r\nMacdonough at Vergennes. Irritated and alarmed by this demonstration,\r\nArmstrong ordered Izard to seize and fortify Rouse’s Point, or the\r\nmouth of Lacolle River, or Ash Island, and so close the entrance\r\nto the Lake.[150] Apparently Armstrong gave the order in ignorance\r\nthat Lacolle River and Ash Island were strongly fortified British\r\npositions,[151] and that a battery established at Rouse’s Point, in\r\nthe relative situation of forces, must have fallen into British hands.\r\nOn this point the opinion of Izard was more valuable than that of\r\nArmstrong; and Izard, after much study and inquiry, decided to erect\r\nhis fortifications at Plattsburg. He preferred the task of taking a\r\nposition which he could certainly hold, although it would not prevent\r\nthe enemy from passing if they chose to leave it behind them. At\r\nPlattsburg, therefore, he collected his troops, amounting to five or\r\nsix thousand men, and constructed strong forts, while Macdonough’s\r\nfleet took position in the bay.\r\n\r\nWhile thus occupied, Izard cast anxious glances westward, doubting\r\nwhether, in case of a reverse at Niagara or Sackett’s Harbor, he ought\r\nnot to move on the St. Lawrence and threaten the British communications\r\nbetween Montreal and Kingston.[152] The same idea occurred to\r\nArmstrong, who in a letter dated July 27 recommended Izard to carry\r\nit out.[153] The letter reached Izard August 10, when he had advanced\r\nwith his army to Chazy, and had learned enough of the concentration of\r\nBritish troops in his front to be assured that they meant to direct\r\ntheir serious attack against Lake Champlain. He wrote Armstrong a\r\nletter, August 11, which failed only in saying too little, rather than\r\ntoo much, of the dangers risked in obeying Armstrong’s order:[154]--\r\n\r\n   “I will make the movement you direct, if possible; but I shall\r\n   do it with the apprehension of risking the force under my\r\n   command, and with the certainty that everything in this vicinity\r\n   but the lately erected works at Plattsburg and Cumberland\r\n   Head will in less than three days after my departure be in\r\n   the possession of the enemy. He is in force superior to mine\r\n   in my front; he daily threatens an attack on my position at\r\n   Champlain; we are in hourly expectation of a serious conflict.\r\n   That he has not attacked us before this time is attributable to\r\n   caution on his part, from exaggerated reports of our numbers,\r\n   and from his expectation of reinforcements.... It has always\r\n   been my conviction that the numerical force of the enemy has\r\n   been under-rated. I believe this to be the strong point of our\r\n   frontier for either attack or defence, and I know that a British\r\n   force has been kept in check in Lower Canada for many weeks\r\n   past, greatly superior to that which I could oppose to it.”\r\n\r\nIzard was right. Every week new British forces poured into Quebec and\r\nwere forwarded to Montreal. The arrival of the first division at Quebec\r\nwas announced in the American newspapers early in August. Within a few\r\nweeks three brigades arrived and were sent to the front. When Izard\r\nwrote, he was probably faced by ten thousand veteran British troops\r\nwithin twenty or thirty miles of his position, and more were known to\r\nbe on their way. At such a moment the danger of attempting a diversion\r\nwas great; but Armstrong refused to believe it. Irritated by Izard’s\r\nremonstrance, the secretary not only persisted in his own opinion, but,\r\nabandoning the idea of a movement against the British communications\r\nalong the St. Lawrence, ordered Izard to march his army to Sackett’s\r\nHarbor, and from there to operate either directly in force against\r\nKingston,[155] or to go on to Niagara and assist Brown, then hard\r\npressed at Fort Erie. “It is very distinctly my opinion,” wrote the\r\nsecretary August 12,[156] “that it has become good policy on our part\r\nto carry the war as far to the westward as possible, particularly while\r\nwe have an ascendency on the Lakes.”\r\n\r\nIzard obeyed. His troops, numbering four thousand men, began their\r\nmarch August 29 for Sackett’s Harbor, and for several weeks at the\r\ncrisis of the campaign ceased to exist for military purposes. Within\r\nthe fortifications at Plattsburg Izard left a miscellaneous body of\r\nthree thousand, three hundred men,[157] without an organized battalion\r\nexcept four companies of the Sixth regiment. Brigadier-General\r\nAlexander Macomb, who as senior officer was left in command, reported\r\nhis force as not exceeding fifteen hundred effectives.[158]\r\n\r\nArmstrong’s policy of meeting the enemy’s main attack by\r\nannihilating the main defence never received explanation or excuse.\r\nAt times Armstrong seemed to suggest that he meant to rely on the\r\nnavy,[159]--and indeed nothing else, except Izard’s forts, was left to\r\nrely upon; but in truth he rather invited the invasion of a British\r\narmy into New York to “renew the scene of Saratoga.”[160] As Izard\r\npredicted, the enemy crossed the frontier at once after his departure,\r\noccupying Chazy September 3, and approaching, September 5, within eight\r\nmiles of Plattsburg.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain had never sent to America so formidable an armament.\r\nNeither Wolfe nor Amherst, neither Burgoyne nor Cornwallis, had led\r\nso large or so fine an army as was under the command of Sir George\r\nPrevost. According to his proposed arrangement, the light brigade,\r\nunder Major-General Robinson, contained four battalions of the\r\nTwenty-seventh, Thirty-ninth, Seventy-sixth, and Eighty-eighth foot,\r\nwith artillery, and numbered two thousand eight hundred and eighty-four\r\nrank-and-file. The second brigade, under Major-General Brisbane,\r\ncontained battalions of the Eighth, Thirteenth, and Forty-ninth, De\r\nMeuron’s regiment and Canadian voltigeurs and chasseurs, numbering\r\nfour thousand and forty-eight rank-and-file. The third brigade, under\r\nMajor-General Power, contained battalions of the Third, Fifth,\r\nTwenty-seventh, and Fifty-eighth, and numbered three thousand eight\r\nhundred and one rank-and-file. The reserve, under Major-General Kempt,\r\ncontained battalions of the Ninth, Thirty-seventh, Fifty-seventh, and\r\nEighty-first, numbering three thousand five hundred and forty-nine\r\nrank-and-file. Finally, fourteen hundred and eighty-eight men of the\r\nSixteenth and Seventieth regiments, under the command of Major-General\r\nDeWatteville, were stationed between Coteau du Lac and Gananoque on the\r\nSt. Lawrence.[161]\r\n\r\nThus the left division of the British army in Canada numbered fifteen\r\nthousand seven hundred and seventy effectives, or, including officers,\r\nprobably eighteen thousand men, without reckoning the Canadian militia,\r\neither incorporated or sedentary. Two lieutenant-generals and five\r\nmajor-generals were in command. Amply provided with artillery and\r\nhorses, every brigade well equipped, they came fresh from a long\r\nservice in which the troops had learned to regard themselves as\r\ninvincible. As they were at last organized, four brigades crossed\r\nthe border, numbering not less than “eleven thousand men with a\r\nproportionate and most excellent train of artillery, commanded in\r\nchief by Sir George Prevost, and under him by officers of the first\r\ndistinction in the service.”[162] A reserve of about five thousand men\r\nremained behind.\r\n\r\nThe fleet was almost as formidable as the army. As the force of the\r\nflotilla was reported to Prevost, it consisted of a thirty-six-gun\r\nship, the “Confiance;” an eighteen-gun brig, the “Linnet;” two ten-gun\r\nsloops and twelve gunboats, carrying sixteen guns,[163]--all commanded\r\nby Captain Downie, of the Royal Navy, detached by Sir James Yeo for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nSuch an expedition was regarded with unhesitating confidence, as able\r\nto go where it pleased within the region of Lake Champlain. About every\r\nother undertaking in America the British entertained doubts, but in\r\nregard to this affair they entertained none.[164] Every movement of\r\nthe British generals showed conviction of their irresistible strength.\r\nHad Prevost doubted the result of attacking Plattsburg, he could have\r\nadvanced by St. Albans on Burlington,[165] which would have obliged\r\nMacomb and Macdonough to leave their positions. So little did his\r\narmy apprehend difficulty, that in advancing to Plattsburg in face of\r\nMacomb’s skirmishers they did not once form in line, or pay attention\r\nto the troops and militia who obstructed the road. “The British troops\r\ndid not deign to fire on them except by their flankers and advanced\r\npatrols,” reported Macomb.[166] “So undaunted was the enemy that he\r\nnever deployed in his whole march, always pressing on in column.”\r\n\r\nThe fleet felt the same certainty. According to the best Canadian\r\nauthority,[167] “the strongest confidence prevailed in the superiority\r\nof the British vessels, their weight of metal, and in the capacity and\r\nexperience of their officers and crews.” Captain Downie informed Sir\r\nGeorge Prevost’s staff-officer that he considered himself with the\r\n“Confiance” alone a match for the whole American squadron.[168] Taking\r\nthe British account of the “Confiance” as correct, she was one hundred\r\nand forty-six feet long on the gun-deck, and thirty-six feet broad; she\r\ncarried a crew of three hundred officers and men;[169] her armament\r\nwas thirty-seven guns,--twenty-seven long twenty-four-pounders,\r\nsix thirty-two-pound carronades, and four twenty-four-pound\r\ncarronades,--throwing in all nine hundred and thirty-six pounds.[170]\r\nThe American account, which was more trustworthy because the\r\n“Confiance” became better known in the American than in the British\r\nservice, gave her thirty-one long twenty-four-pounders and six\r\ncarronades.[171]\r\n\r\nMacdonough’s best ship was the “Saratoga.” Her dimensions were\r\nnot recorded. Her regular complement of men was two hundred and\r\nten, but she fought with two hundred and forty; she carried eight\r\ntwenty-four-pounders, twelve thirty-two and six forty-two-pound\r\ncarronades,--or twenty-six guns, throwing eight hundred and\r\ntwenty-eight pounds. Her inferiority to the “Confiance” at long range\r\nwas immense, and within carronade range it was at least sufficient to\r\nsatisfy Captain Downie. He believed that a few broadsides would dispose\r\nof the “Saratoga,” and that the other American vessels must then\r\nsurrender.\r\n\r\nAssuming Sir George Prevost’s report to have been correct, the two\r\nfleets compared as follows:[172]--\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Force of British Fleet._\r\n\r\n                                              Long  Short   Weight of\r\n       Vessels.

In one case the British\r\nwould have thrown about nineteen hundred pounds of metal,--in the\r\nother, about eighteen hundred. A glance at the two tables shows that in\r\none respect Downie held a decisive superiority in his guns. He had no\r\nless than sixty long-range pieces, while Macdonough had but forty-five.\r\nDownie’s long-range guns threw at least eleven hundred pounds of metal;\r\nMacdonough’s threw but seven hundred and sixty. If Downie chose his\r\nown distance beyond range of the thirty-two-pound carronades, and\r\nfought only his long guns, nothing could save Macdonough except extreme\r\ngood fortune, for he had but fourteen twenty-four-pound guns against\r\nDownie’s thirty-four. Firing by broadsides, Downie could throw from his\r\nsingle ship, the “Confiance,” sixteen twenty-four-pound shot, to which\r\nMacdonough could reply only with eight, even if he used all his long\r\nguns on the same side.\r\n\r\nThe Americans had a decided advantage only in their commander. Thomas\r\nMacdonough, born in Delaware in 1783, was thirty years old when this\r\nresponsibility fell upon him. He had been educated, like most of the\r\nnaval heroes, in the hard service of the Tripolitan war, and had been\r\nsent to construct and command the naval force on Lake Champlain in\r\nthe spring of 1813. Macdonough’s superiority over ordinary commanders\r\nconsisted in the intelligent forethought with which he provided for\r\nthe chances of battle. His arrangement showed that he foresaw, and\r\nas far as possible overcame in advance, every conceivable attack. He\r\ncompelled the enemy to fight only as pleased himself.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    PLAN\r\n    OF THE\r\n    BATTLE\r\n    OF\r\n    PLATTSBURG\r\n\r\n    Position of vessels\r\n    20 M. after anchoring]\r\n\r\nMacdonough anchored his four large vessels across Plattsburg Bay,\r\nwhere it was a mile and a half wide, and placed his gunboats in their\r\nrear to fill the gaps. Cumberland Head on his left and front, and Crab\r\nIsland on his right obliged the enemy to enter in a line so narrow\r\nthat Downie would find no room to anchor on his broadside out of\r\ncarronade range, but must sail into the harbor under the raking fire\r\nof the American long guns, and take a position within range of the\r\nAmerican carronades.[173] As the battle was to be fought at anchor,\r\nboth squadrons would as a matter of course be anchored with springs on\r\ntheir cables; but Macdonough took the additional precaution of laying\r\na kedge off each bow of the “Saratoga,” bringing their hawsers in on\r\nthe two quarters, and letting them hang in bights under water.[174]\r\nThis arrangement enabled him to wind his ship at any time without fear\r\nof having his cables cut by the enemy’s shot, and to use his larboard\r\nbroadside if his starboard guns should be disabled. In effect, it\r\ndoubled his fighting capacity.\r\n\r\nSir George Prevost and the army were ready to move before Downie’s\r\nfleet could be prepared. Marching directly forward with the utmost\r\nconfidence, Sir George turned the advanced American position at Dead\r\nCreek Bridge and drove away the gunboats that covered it. He reached\r\nthe Saranac River September 6, and saw beyond it a ridge “crowned with\r\nthree strong redoubts and other field-works, and blockhouses armed with\r\nheavy ordnance, with their flotilla at anchor out of gunshot from the\r\nshore.”[175] The description was not exaggerated. Izard was himself a\r\ntrained engineer, and the works built by him, under the direction of\r\nMajor Totten of the Engineer Corps, were believed capable of resisting\r\nfor three weeks a combined attack by land and water, even if the\r\nBritish fleet were victorious.[176] Three good companies of artillery\r\nmanned the guns. Excellent officers of every arm were in command.\r\n\r\nPrevost properly halted, and declined to assault without the\r\nco-operation of the fleet. He waited five days impatiently for Downie\r\nto appear. Not till seven o’clock on the morning of September 11 did\r\nthe British flotilla sail round Cumberland Head. At the same time\r\nPrevost ordered his troops to cross the Saranac and storm the American\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nDownie intended, without regarding his superiority in long-range guns,\r\nto sail in and to lay the “Confiance” alongside of the “Saratoga;” but\r\nthe wind was light and baffling, and his approach was so slow that he\r\ncould not long bear the raking fire of the American guns. As he came\r\nwithin carronade range the wind baffling, he was obliged to anchor\r\nat two cables’ lengths,[177] or three hundred yards,[178] and begin\r\naction. With the same discipline that marked the movements of the\r\ntroops on shore, Downie came to, anchored, made everything secure, and\r\nthen poured a full broadside into Macdonough’s ship. The “Saratoga”\r\nshivered under the shock of sixteen twenty-four-pound shot and canister\r\ncharges striking her hull; almost one-fifth of her crew were disabled;\r\nbut she stood stoutly to her work, and the whole line was soon hotly\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\nAmericans usually had a decided advantage in their better gunnery, but\r\nthree hundred yards was a long range for thirty-two-pound carronades,\r\nwhich at point-blank carried less than two hundred and fifty yards,\r\nand lost accuracy in proportion to elevation.[179] Macdonough was\r\nslow to prove superiority. Early in the battle the British suffered\r\na severe, and perhaps in the experience of this war a decisive, loss\r\nin their commander, Captain Downie, instantly killed by one of his\r\nown guns thrown off its carriage against him by a solid shot. Yet at\r\nthe end of two hours’ combat the British squadron was on the whole\r\nvictorious, and the American on the point of capture. Of the three\r\nsmaller American vessels, the “Preble” on the extreme right was driven\r\nout of the engagement, and the British gunboats, turning the American\r\nflank, attacked the “Ticonderoga,” which maintained a doubtful battle.\r\nThe American left was also turned, the “Eagle” having been driven to\r\ntake refuge between the “Saratoga” and “Ticonderoga,” in the centre.\r\nMacdonough’s ship was then exposed to the concentrated fire of the\r\n“Confiance” and “Linnet,” and his battery was soon silenced. The\r\n“Saratoga” could no longer use a gun on the engaged side, and the\r\nbattle was nearly lost.\r\n\r\nThen Macdonough’s forethought changed the impending defeat into\r\nvictory. His fire had nearly silenced the “Confiance,” and disregarding\r\nthe “Linnet,” he ceased attention to the battle in order to direct the\r\noperation of winding ship. Little by little hauling the ship about,\r\nhe opened on the “Confiance” with one gun after another of the fresh\r\nbroadside, as they bore; and the “Confiance,” after trying in vain to\r\neffect the same operation, struck her colors. Then the British fleet\r\nwas in the situation which Downie had anticipated for the Americans in\r\nthe event of silencing the “Saratoga.” The three smaller vessels were\r\nobliged to surrender, and the gunboats alone escaped. The battle had\r\nlasted from quarter past eight till quarter before eleven.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    POSITIONS\r\n    OF THE\r\n    BRITISH AND AMERICAN FORCES\r\n    AT\r\n    PLATTSBURG\r\n\r\n    AFTER A SKETCH BY\r\n    BRIG. GEN. MACOMB]\r\n\r\nBy land, the British attack was much less effective than by water. The\r\ntroops were slow in reaching their positions, and had time to make no\r\ndecisive movement. A column under Major-General Robinson was ordered\r\nto move round by the right flank to a ford previously reconnoitred,\r\nsome distance up the Saranac, in order to gain a position whence\r\nthey could reverse the American works and carry them by assault;\r\nbut Robinson’s column missed its way, and before reaching the ford\r\nheard the cheers of the American troops, and halted to ascertain its\r\ncause.[180] The remainder of the army waited for Robinson’s column to\r\nassault. The casualties showed that nothing like a serious engagement\r\ntook place. The entire loss of the British army from September 6 to\r\nSeptember 14 was officially reported as only thirty-seven killed and\r\none hundred and fifty wounded, and of this loss a large part occurred\r\nprevious to the battle of September 11. The entire American loss was\r\nthirty-seven killed and sixty-two wounded.\r\n\r\nIn the naval battle, Macdonough reported fifty-two killed and\r\nfifty-eight wounded, among about eight hundred and eighty men. The\r\nBritish reported fifty-seven killed and seventy-two wounded, in\r\ncrews whose number was never precisely known, but was probably fully\r\neight hundred. In neither case was the loss, though severe, as great\r\nrelatively to the numbers as the severity of the action seemed to\r\nimply. The “Saratoga” lost twenty-eight killed in a crew of two\r\nhundred and forty. In Perry’s battle on Lake Erie, the “Lawrence” lost\r\ntwenty-two men killed in a crew of one hundred and thirty-one. About\r\none man in eight was killed on Macdonough’s ship; about one man in six\r\non Perry’s.\r\n\r\nWith needless precipitation, Prevost instantly retreated the next day\r\nto Champlain, sacrificing stores to a very great amount, and losing\r\nmany men by desertion. The army was cruelly mortified, and Prevost lost\r\nwhatever military reputation he still preserved in Canada. In England\r\nthe impression of disgrace was equally strong. “It is scarcely possible\r\nto conceive the degree of mortification and disappointment,” said the\r\n“Annual Register,”[181] “which the intelligence of this defeat created\r\nin Great Britain.” Yeo brought official charges of misconduct against\r\nPrevost, and Prevost defended himself by unusual arguments.\r\n\r\n   “With whatever sorrow I may think of the unfortunate occurrences\r\n   to which I allude,” he wrote to Bathurst, three weeks\r\n   later,[182] “I consider them as light and trivial when compared\r\n   to the disastrous results which, I am solemnly persuaded, would\r\n   have ensued had any considerations of personal glory, or any\r\n   unreflecting disregard of the safety of the province, or of the\r\n   honor of the army committed to my charge, induced me to pursue\r\n   those offensive operations by land, independent of the fleet,\r\n   which it would appear by your Lordship’s despatch were expected\r\n   of me. Such operations, my Lord, have been attempted before, and\r\n   on the same ground. The history of our country records their\r\n   failure; and had they been undertaken again with double the\r\n   force placed under my command, they would have issued in the\r\n   discomfiture of his Majesty’s arms, and in a defeat not more\r\n   disastrous than inevitable.”\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington was not so severe as other critics, and\r\nhesitated to say that Prevost was wrong; “though of this I am certain,\r\nhe must equally have returned ... after the fleet was beaten; and I am\r\ninclined to think he was right. I have told the ministers repeatedly\r\nthat a naval superiority on the Lakes is a _sine qua non_ of\r\nsuccess in war on the frontier of Canada, even if our object should\r\nbe wholly defensive.”[183] Yet the Duke in conversation seemed to\r\nthink that his army in Canada was also at fault. “He had sent them\r\nsome of his best troops from Bordeaux,” he said five-and-twenty years\r\nafterward,[184] “but they did not turn out quite right; they wanted\r\nthis iron fist to command them.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Major-General Izard, by Armstrong’s order, marched his four\r\nthousand men as far as possible from the points of attack. Starting\r\nfrom Champlain, August 29, the army reached Sackett’s Harbor September\r\n17, having marched about two hundred and eighty miles in twenty days.\r\nAt Sackett’s Harbor Izard found no orders from the government, for\r\nthe government at that time had ceased to perform its functions; but\r\nhe received an earnest appeal from General Brown to succor Fort Erie.\r\n“I will not conceal from you,” wrote Brown, September 10,[185] “that\r\nI consider the fate of this army very doubtful unless speedy relief\r\nis afforded.” Izard, who had no means of testing the correctness of\r\nthis opinion, decided to follow Brown’s wishes, and made, September\r\n17, the necessary preparations. Violent storms prevented Chauncey from\r\nembarking the troops until September 21; but September 27 the troops\r\nreached Batavia, and Izard met Brown by appointment. The army had then\r\nbeen a month in movement. The distance was more than four hundred\r\nmiles, and no energy could have shortened the time so much as to have\r\naffected the result of the campaign. At one end of the line Sir George\r\nPrevost retreated from Plattsburg September 12; at the other end,\r\nLieutenant-General Drummond retreated from Fort Erie September 21; and\r\nIzard’s force, constituting the largest body of regular troops in the\r\nfield, had been placed where it could possibly affect neither result.\r\n\r\nIzard was a friend of Monroe, and was therefore an object of\r\nArmstrong’s merciless criticism.[186] Brown was a favorite of\r\nArmstrong, and shared his prejudices. The position of Izard at\r\nBuffalo was calculated to excite jealousy. He had implicitly obeyed\r\nthe wishes of Armstrong and Brown; in doing so, he had sacrificed\r\nhimself,--yielding to Macomb the credit of repulsing Prevost, and\r\nto Brown, who did not wait for his arrival, the credit of repulsing\r\nDrummond. As far as could be seen, Izard had acted with loyalty toward\r\nboth Armstrong and Brown; yet both distrusted him. Brown commonly\r\ninclined toward severity, and was the more sensitive because Izard, as\r\nthe senior officer, necessarily took command.\r\n\r\nUntil that moment Izard had enjoyed no chance of showing his abilities\r\nin the field, but at Niagara he saw before him a great opportunity.\r\nDrummond lay at Chippawa, with an army reduced by battle and sickness\r\nto about twenty-five hundred men. Izard commanded fifty-five hundred\r\nregular troops and eight hundred militia.[187] He had time to capture\r\nor destroy Drummond’s entire force before the winter should set\r\nin, and to gather the results of Brown’s desperate fighting. Brown\r\nwas eager for the attack, and Izard assented. October 13 the army\r\nmoved on Chippawa, and stopped. October 16, Izard wrote to the War\r\nDepartment,[188]--\r\n\r\n   “I have just learned by express from Sackett’s Harbor that\r\n   Commodore Chauncey with the whole of his fleet has retired\r\n   into port, and is throwing up batteries for its protection.\r\n   This defeats all the objects of the operations by land in this\r\n   quarter. I may turn Chippawa, and should General Drummond not\r\n   retire, may succeed in giving him a good deal of trouble; but\r\n   if he falls back on Fort George or Burlington Heights, every\r\n   step I take in pursuit exposes me to be cut off by the large\r\n   reinforcements it is in the power of the enemy to throw in\r\n   twenty-four hours upon my flank or rear.”\r\n\r\nIn this state of mind, notwithstanding a successful skirmish, October\r\n19, between Bissell’s brigade and a strong detachment of the enemy,\r\nIzard made a decision which ruined his military reputation and\r\ndestroyed his usefulness to the service. He reported to the Department,\r\nOctober 23,[189]--\r\n\r\n   “On the 21st, finding that he [Drummond] still continued\r\n   within his works, which he had been assiduously engaged in\r\n   strengthening from the moment of our first appearance, the\r\n   weather beginning to be severe, and a great quantity of our\r\n   officers and men suffering from their continued fatigues and\r\n   exposure, at twelve at noon I broke up my encampment, and\r\n   marched to this ground [opposite Black Rock] in order to prepare\r\n   winter quarters for the troops.”\r\n\r\nNothing remained but to break up the army. Brown was sent at his own\r\nrequest to Sackett’s Harbor, where the next fighting was expected. A\r\ndivision of the army went with him. The remainder were placed in winter\r\nquarters near Buffalo. Fort Erie was abandoned and blown up, November\r\n5, and the frontier at Niagara relapsed into repose.\r\n\r\nIzard felt the mortification of his failure. His feelings were those\r\nof a generous character, and his tone toward Brown contrasted to his\r\nadvantage both in candor and in temper with Brown’s language toward\r\nhim; but great energy generally implied great faults, and Brown’s\r\nfaults were better suited than Izard’s virtues for the work of an\r\nAmerican general at Niagara. Greatly to Izard’s credit, he not only saw\r\nhis own inferiority, but advised the government of it. He wrote to the\r\nSecretary of War, November 20,[190]--\r\n\r\n   “The success of the next campaign on this frontier will in a\r\n   great measure depend on concert and good understanding among\r\n   the superior officers.... General Brown is certainly a brave,\r\n   intelligent, and active officer. Where a portion of the forces\r\n   is composed of irregular troops, I have no hesitation in\r\n   acknowledging my conviction of his being better qualified than I\r\n   to make them useful in the public service.”\r\n\r\nSo sensitive was Izard to the public feeling and his loss of standing\r\nthat he sent his resignation to the secretary, December 18,[191] in\r\nterms which betrayed and even asserted his consciousness of shrinking\r\nunder the weight of responsibility:--\r\n\r\n   “I am fully aware that attempts have been made to lessen the\r\n   confidence of government as well as of the public in my ability\r\n   to execute the important duties intrusted to me,--duties which\r\n   were imposed unexpectedly and much against my inclination. It\r\n   is therefore not improbable that my voluntary retirement will\r\n   relieve the Department of War from some embarrassment, and\r\n   that my individual satisfaction will accord with the public\r\n   advantage,--especially as my view of the connection between\r\n   military command and responsibility differs materially from that\r\n   entertained by persons in high authority.”\r\n\r\nA man who showed so little confidence in himself could not claim the\r\nconfidence of others, and in contact with stronger characters like\r\nArmstrong, Brown, Scott, or Andrew Jackson could play no part but\r\nthat of a victim. His resignation was not accepted, but his career\r\nwas at an end. When he relieved the pressure kept by Brown constantly\r\napplied to the extremity of the British line, the movement of war\r\nnecessarily turned back to its true object, which was Sackett’s\r\nHarbor. Drummond no sooner saw Fort Erie evacuated and his lines\r\nre-established, November 5, than he hurried on board ship with a part\r\nof his troops, and reached Kingston, November 10,[192] where Sir\r\nGeorge Prevost had already prepared for an attack on Sackett’s Harbor\r\nas soon as supplies could be brought from Quebec to Kingston over\r\nthe winter roads. Soon afterward Sir George Prevost was recalled to\r\nEngland, and a new commander-in-chief, Sir George Murray, supposed to\r\nbe a man of higher capacity, was sent to take direction of the next\r\ncampaign. Reinforcements continued to arrive.[193] About twenty-seven\r\nthousand regular troops, including officers, were in Canada;[194] a\r\nseventy-four-gun ship and a new frigate were launched at Kingston;\r\nand no one doubted that, with the spring, Sackett’s Harbor would be\r\nformally besieged. Izard remained at Buffalo, doing nothing, and his\r\nonly influence on the coming as on the past campaign was to leave the\r\ninitiative to the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nARMSTRONG’S management of the Northern campaign caused severe\r\ncriticism; but his neglect of the city of Washington exhausted the\r\npublic patience. For two years Washington stood unprotected; not a\r\nbattery or a breastwork was to be found on the river bank except the\r\nold and untenable Fort Washington, or Warburton.[195] A thousand\r\ndetermined men might reach the town in thirty-six hours, and destroy\r\nit before any general alarm could be given.[196] Yet no city was more\r\neasily protected than Washington, at that day, from attack on its\r\neastern side; any good engineer could have thrown up works in a week\r\nthat would have made approach by a small force impossible. Armstrong\r\nneglected to fortify. After experience had proved his error, he still\r\nargued in writing to a committee of Congress[197] that fortifications\r\nwould have exhausted the Treasury; “that bayonets are known to\r\nform the most efficient barriers; and that there was no reason in this\r\ncase to doubt beforehand the willingness of the country to defend\r\nitself,”--as though he believed that militia were most efficient when\r\nmost exposed! He did not even provide the bayonets.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    POSITIONS\r\n    OF THE\r\n    BRITISH AND AMERICAN\r\n    FORCES NEAR\r\n    WASHINGTON AND BALTIMORE,\r\n    FROM AUGUST 20 TO SEPTEMBER 12 1814]\r\n\r\nIn truth, Armstrong looking at the matter as a military critic decided\r\nthat the British having no strategic object in capturing Washington,\r\nwould not make the attempt. Being an indolent man, negligent of\r\ndetail, he never took unnecessary trouble; and having no proper staff\r\nat Washington, he was without military advisers whose opinion he\r\nrespected. The President and Monroe fretted at his indifference, the\r\npeople of the District were impatient under it, and every one except\r\nArmstrong was in constant terror of attack; but according to their\r\naccount the secretary only replied: “No, no! Baltimore is the place,\r\nsir; that is of so much more consequence.”[198] Probably he was right,\r\nand the British would have gone first to Baltimore had his negligence\r\nnot invited them to Washington.\r\n\r\nIn May the President began to press Armstrong for precautionary\r\nmeasures.[199] In June letters arrived from Gallatin and Bayard in\r\nLondon which caused the President to call a Cabinet meeting. June 23\r\nand 24 the Cabinet met and considered the diplomatic situation.[200]\r\nThe President proposed then for the first time to abandon impressment\r\nas a _sine qua non_ of negotiation, and to approve a treaty that\r\nshould be silent on the subject. Armstrong and Jones alone supported\r\nthe idea at that time, but three days afterward, June 27, Monroe\r\nand Campbell acceded to it. The Cabinet then took the defences of\r\nWashington in hand, and July 1 decided to organize a corps of defence\r\nfrom the militia of the District and the neighboring States. July 2,\r\nthe first step toward efficient defence was taken by creating a new\r\nmilitary district on the Potomac, with a military head of its own.\r\nArmstrong wished to transfer Brigadier-General Moses Porter from\r\nNorfolk, to command the new Potomac District;[201] but the President\r\nselected Brigadier-General Winder, because his relationship to the\r\nFederalist governor of Maryland was likely to make co-operation more\r\neffective.\r\n\r\nPolitical appointments were not necessarily bad; but in appointing\r\nWinder to please the governor of Maryland Madison assumed the\r\nresponsibility, in Armstrong’s eyes, for the defence of Washington.\r\nThe Secretary of War seemed to think that Madison and Monroe were\r\nacting together to take the defence of Washington out of his hands,\r\nand to put it in hands in which they felt confidence. Armstrong\r\nplaced Winder instantly in command, and promptly issued the orders\r\narranged in Cabinet; but he left further measures to Winder, Monroe,\r\nand Madison. His conduct irritated the President; but no one charged\r\nthat the secretary refused to carry out the orders, or to satisfy the\r\nrequisitions of the President or of General Winder. He was merely\r\npassive.[202]\r\n\r\nWinder received his appointment July 5, and went to Washington for\r\ninstructions. He passed the next month riding between Washington,\r\nBaltimore, and points on the lower Potomac and Patuxent,[203] obtaining\r\nwith great fatigue a personal knowledge of the country. August 1 he\r\nestablished his permanent headquarters at Washington, and the entire\r\nresult of his labors till that time was the presence of one company\r\nof Maryland militia at Bladensburg. No line of defence was selected,\r\nno obstructions to the roads were prepared, and not so much as a\r\nditch or a breastwork was marked out or suggested between Annapolis\r\nand Washington. Another fortnight passed, and still Winder was not\r\nfurther advanced. He had no more men, arms, fortifications, and no\r\nmore ideas, on the 18th of August than on the 5th of July. “The\r\ncall for three thousand militia under the requisition of July 4 had\r\nproduced only two hundred and fifty men at the moment the enemy landed\r\nat Benedict.”[204] Winder had then been six weeks in command of the\r\nWashington defences.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a British expedition under command of Major-General Robert\r\nRoss, a distinguished officer of the Peninsula army, sailed from\r\nthe Gironde, June 27, to Bermuda. Ross was instructed “to effect a\r\ndiversion on the coasts of the United States of America in favor of\r\nthe army employed in the defence of Upper and Lower Canada.” The point\r\nof attack was to be decided by Vice-Admiral Cochrane, subject to the\r\ngeneral’s approval; but the force was not intended for “any extended\r\noperation at a distance from the coast,” nor was Ross to hold permanent\r\npossession of any captured district.[205]\r\n\r\n   “When the object of the descent which you may make on the coast\r\n   is to take possession of any naval or military stores, you will\r\n   not delay the destruction of them in preference to the taking\r\n   them away, if there is reasonable ground of apprehension that\r\n   the enemy is advancing with superior force to effect their\r\n   recovery. If in any descent you shall be enabled to take such\r\n   a position as to threaten the inhabitants with the destruction\r\n   of their property, you are hereby authorized to levy upon them\r\n   contributions in return for your forbearance; but you will\r\n   not by this understand that the magazines belonging to the\r\n   government, or their harbors, or their shipping, are to be\r\n   included in such an arrangement. These, together with their\r\n   contents, are in all cases to be taken away or destroyed.”\r\n\r\nNegroes were not to be encouraged to rise upon their masters, and\r\nno slaves were to be taken away as slaves; but any negro who should\r\nexpose himself to vengeance by joining the expedition or lending it\r\nassistance, might be enlisted in the black corps, or carried away by\r\nthe fleet.\r\n\r\nNothing in these orders warranted the destruction of private or public\r\nproperty, except such as might be capable of military uses. Ross was\r\nnot authorized, and did not intend, to enter on a mere marauding\r\nexpedition; but Cochrane was independent of Ross, and at about the\r\ntime when Ross reached Bermuda Cochrane received a letter from Sir\r\nGeorge Prevost which gave an unexpected character to the Chesapeake\r\nexpedition. A small body of American troops had crossed Lake Erie\r\nto Long Point, May 15, and destroyed the flour-mills, distilleries,\r\nand some private houses there. The raid was not authorized by the\r\nUnited States government, and the officer commanding it was afterward\r\ncourt-martialed and censured; but Sir George Prevost, without waiting\r\nfor explanations, wrote to Vice-Admiral Cochrane, June 2, suggesting\r\nthat he should “assist in inflicting that measure of retaliation which\r\nshall deter the enemy from a repetition of similar outrages.”[206]\r\n\r\nWhen Cochrane received this letter, he issued at Bermuda, July 18,\r\norders to the ships under his command, from the St. Croix River to\r\nthe St. Mary’s, directing general retaliation.[207] The orders were\r\ninteresting as an illustration of the temper the war had taken.\r\n\r\n   “You are hereby required and directed,” wrote the Vice-Admiral\r\n   to the British blockading squadrons, “to destroy and lay\r\n   waste such towns and districts upon the coast as you may find\r\n   assailable. You will hold strictly in view the conduct of\r\n   the American army toward his Majesty’s unoffending Canadian\r\n   subjects, and you will spare merely the lives of the unarmed\r\n   inhabitants of the United States. For only by carrying this\r\n   retributory justice into the country of our enemy can we hope\r\n   to make him sensible of the impropriety as well as of the\r\n   inhumanity of the system he has adopted. You will take every\r\n   opportunity of explaining to the people how much I lament the\r\n   necessity of following the rigorous example of the commander\r\n   of the American forces. And as these commanders must obviously\r\n   have acted under instructions from the Executive government\r\n   of the United States, whose intimate and unnatural connection\r\n   with the late government of France has led them to adopt the\r\n   same system of plunder and devastation, it is therefore to\r\n   their own government the unfortunate sufferers must look for\r\n   indemnification for their loss of property.”\r\n\r\nThis ill-advised order was to remain in force until Sir George Prevost\r\nshould send information “that the United States government have come\r\nunder an obligation to make full remuneration to the injured and\r\nunoffending inhabitants of the Canadas for all the outrages their\r\ntroops have committed.” Cochrane further wrote to Prevost that “as\r\nsoon as these orders have been acted upon,” a copy would be sent to\r\nWashington for the information of the Executive government.\r\n\r\nCochrane’s retaliatory order was dated July 18, and Ross’s transports\r\narrived at Bermuda July 24. As soon as the troops were collected and\r\nstores put on board, Cochrane and Ross sailed, August 3, for Chesapeake\r\nBay. They arrived a few days in advance of the transports, and passing\r\nup the bay to the mouth of the Potomac, landed, August 15, with Rear\r\nAdmiral Cockburn, to decide on a plan for using to best effect the\r\nforces under their command.\r\n\r\nThree objects were within reach. The first and immediate aim was a\r\nflotilla of gunboats, commanded by Captain Joshua Barney, which had\r\ntaken refuge in the Patuxent River, and was there blockaded. The next\r\nnatural object of desire was Baltimore, on account of its shipping and\r\nprize-money. The third was Washington and Alexandria, on account of the\r\nnavy-yard and the vessels in the Potomac. Baltimore was the natural\r\npoint of attack after destroying Barney’s flotilla; but Cockburn,\r\nwith a sailor’s recklessness, urged a dash at Washington.[208] Ross\r\nhesitated, and postponed a decision till Barney’s flotilla should be\r\ndisposed of.\r\n\r\nTwo days afterward, August 17, the troops arrived, and the squadron,\r\ncommanded by Vice-Admiral Cochrane, moved twenty miles up the bay to\r\nthe mouth of the Patuxent,--a point about fifty miles distant from\r\nAnnapolis on the north, and from Washington on the northwest. Having\r\narrived there August 18, Cochrane wrote, or afterward ante-dated, an\r\nofficial letter to Secretary Monroe:[209]--\r\n\r\n   “Having been called on by the Governor-General of the Canadas\r\n   to aid him in carrying into effect measures of retaliation\r\n   against the inhabitants of the United States for the wanton\r\n   destruction committed by their army in Upper Canada, it has\r\n   become imperiously my duty, conformably with the nature of the\r\n   Governor-General’s application, to issue to the naval force\r\n   under my command an order to destroy and lay waste such towns\r\n   and districts upon the coast as may be found assailable.”\r\n\r\nThe notice was the more remarkable because Cochrane’s order was issued\r\nonly to the naval force. The army paid no attention to it. Ross’s\r\ntroops were landed at Benedict the next day, August 19; but neither\r\nthere nor elsewhere did they destroy or lay waste towns or districts.\r\nThey rather showed unusual respect for private property.\r\n\r\nAt Benedict, August 19, the British forces were organized in three\r\nbrigades, numbering, according to different British accounts, four\r\nthousand five hundred, or four thousand rank-and-file.[210] Cockburn\r\nwith the boats of the fleet the next day, August 20, started up the\r\nriver in search of Barney’s flotilla; while the land force began its\r\nmarch at four o’clock in the afternoon abreast of the boats, and camped\r\nfour miles above Benedict without seeing an enemy, or suffering from a\r\nworse annoyance than one of the evening thunder-storms common in hot\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nThe next day at dawn the British army started again, and marched that\r\nday, Sunday, August 21, twelve miles to the village of Nottingham,\r\nwhere it camped.[211] The weather was hot, and the march resembled a\r\nmidsummer picnic. Through a thickly wooded region, where a hundred\r\nmilitia-men with axes and spades could have delayed their progress for\r\ndays, the British army moved in a solitude apparently untenanted by\r\nhuman beings, till they reached Nottingham on the Patuxent,--a deserted\r\ntown, rich in growing crops and full barns.\r\n\r\nAt Nottingham the army passed a quiet night, and the next morning,\r\nMonday, August 22, lingered till eight o’clock, when it again advanced.\r\nAmong the officers in the Eighty-fifth regiment was a lieutenant\r\nnamed Gleig, who wrote afterward a charming narrative of the campaign\r\nunder the title, “A Subaltern in America.” He described the road as\r\nremarkably good, running for the most part through the heart of thick\r\nforests, which sheltered it from the rays of the sun. During the march\r\nthe army was startled by the distant sound of several heavy explosions.\r\nBarney had blown up his gunboats to prevent their capture. The British\r\nnaval force had thus performed its part in the enterprise, and the\r\narmy was next to take the lead. Ross halted at Marlboro after a march\r\nof only seven miles, and there too he camped, undisturbed by sight\r\nor sound of an armed enemy, although the city of Washington was but\r\nsixteen miles on his left, and Baltimore thirty miles in his front.\r\nRoss had then marched twenty or twenty-one miles into Maryland without\r\nseeing an enemy, although an American army had been close on his left\r\nflank, watching him all day.\r\n\r\nAt Marlboro Ross was obliged to decide what he should next do. He\r\nwas slow in forming a conclusion. Instead of marching at day-break\r\nof August 23, and moving rapidly on Baltimore or Washington, the\r\narmy passed nearly the whole day at Marlboro in idleness, as though\r\nit were willing to let the Americans do their utmost for defence.\r\n“Having advanced within sixteen miles of Washington,” Ross officially\r\nreported,[212] “and ascertained the force of the enemy to be such as\r\nmight authorize an attempt to carry his capital, I determined to make\r\nit, and accordingly put the troops in movement on the evening of the\r\n23d.” More exactly, the troops moved at two o’clock in the afternoon,\r\nand marched about six miles on the road to Washington, when they struck\r\nAmerican outposts at about five o’clock, and saw a force posted on\r\nhigh ground about a mile in their front. As the British formed to\r\nattack, the American force disappeared, and the British army camped\r\nabout nine miles from Washington by way of the navy-yard bridge over\r\nthe Eastern Branch.\r\n\r\nThus for five days, from August 18 to August 23, a British army, which\r\nthough small was larger than any single body of American regulars then\r\nin the field, marched in a leisurely manner through a long-settled\r\ncountry, and met no show of resistance before coming within sight of\r\nthe Capitol. Such an adventure resembled the stories of Cortez and\r\nDe Soto; and the conduct of the United States government offered no\r\ncontradiction to the resemblance.\r\n\r\nNews of the great fleet that appeared in the Patuxent August 17 reached\r\nWashington on the morning of Thursday, August 18, and set the town\r\nin commotion. In haste the President sent fresh militia requisitions\r\nto the neighboring States, and ordered out the militia and all the\r\nregular troops in Washington and its neighborhood. Monroe started\r\nagain as a scout, arriving in the neighborhood of Benedict at ten\r\no’clock on the morning of August 20, and remaining there all day and\r\nnight without learning more than he knew before starting.[213] Winder\r\nwas excessively busy, but did, according to his own account, nothing.\r\n“The innumerably multiplied orders, letters, consultations, and\r\ndemands which crowded upon me at the moment of such an alarm can more\r\neasily be conceived than described, and occupied me nearly day and\r\nnight, from Thursday the 18th of August till Sunday the 21st, and had\r\nnearly broken down myself and assistants in preparing, dispensing, and\r\nattending to them.” Armstrong, at last alive to the situation, made\r\nexcellent suggestions,[214] but could furnish neither troops, means,\r\nnor military intelligence to carry them out; and the President could\r\nonly call for help. The single step taken for defence was taken by the\r\ncitizens, who held a meeting Saturday evening, and offered at their own\r\nexpense to erect works at Bladensburg. Winder accepted their offer.\r\nArmstrong detailed Colonel Wadsworth, the only engineer officer near\r\nthe Department, to lay out the lines, and the citizens did such work as\r\nwas possible in the time that remained.\r\n\r\nAfter three days of confusion, a force was at last evolved. Probably\r\nby Winder’s order, although no such order was preserved, a corps\r\nof observation was marched across the navy-yard bridge toward the\r\nPatuxent, or drawn from Bladensburg, to a place called the Woodyard,\r\ntwelve miles beyond the Eastern Branch. The force was not to be\r\ndespised. Three hundred infantry regulars of different regiments,\r\nwith one hundred and twenty light dragoons, formed the nucleus; two\r\nhundred and fifty Maryland militia, and about twelve hundred District\r\nvolunteers or militia, with twelve six-pound field-pieces, composed a\r\nbody of near two thousand men,[215] from whom General Brown or Andrew\r\nJackson would have got good service. Winder came out and took command\r\nSunday evening, and Monroe, much exhausted, joined them that night.\r\n\r\nThere the men stood Monday, August 22, while the British army marched\r\nby them, within sight of their outposts, from Nottingham to Marlboro.\r\nWinder rode forward with his cavalry and watched all day the enemy’s\r\nleisurely movements close in his front,[216] but the idea of attack did\r\nnot appear to enter his mind. “A doubt at that time,” he said,[217]\r\n“was not entertained by anybody of the intention of the enemy to\r\nproceed direct to Washington.” At nine o’clock that evening Monroe sent\r\na note to the President, saying that the enemy was in full march for\r\nWashington; that Winder proposed to retire till he could collect his\r\ntroops; that preparations should be made to destroy the bridges, and\r\nthat the papers in the government offices should be removed.[218] At\r\nthe same time Monroe notified Serurier, the only foreign minister then\r\nin Washington, that the single hope of saving the capital depended on\r\nthe very doubtful result of an engagement, which would probably take\r\nplace the next day or the day after, at Bladensburg.[219]\r\n\r\nAt Bladensburg, of necessity, the engagement must take place, unless\r\nWinder made an attack or waited for attack on the road. One of two\r\ncourses was to be taken,--Washington must be either defended or\r\nevacuated. Perhaps Winder would have done better to evacuate it, and\r\nlet the British take the undefended village; but no suggestion of the\r\nsort was made, nor did Winder retreat to Bladensburg as was necessary\r\nif he meant to unite his troops and make preparations for a battle.\r\nInstead of retreating to Bladensburg as soon as he was satisfied--at\r\nnoon of Monday, August 22--that the British were going there, he\r\nordered his troops to fall back, and took position at the Old Fields,\r\nabout five miles in the rear of the Woodyard, and about seven miles\r\nby road from the navy-yard. Another road led from the Old Fields to\r\nBladensburg about eight miles away. The American force might have been\r\nunited at Bladensburg Monday evening, but Winder camped at the Old\r\nFields and passed the night.\r\n\r\nThat evening the President and the members of the Cabinet rode out to\r\nthe camp, and the next morning the President reviewed the army, which\r\nhad been reinforced by Commodore Barney with four hundred sailors,\r\nthe crews of the burned gunboats. Winder then had twenty-five hundred\r\nmen, of whom near a thousand were regulars, or sailors even better\r\nfighting troops than ordinary regulars. Such a force vigorously led\r\nwas sufficient to give Ross’s army a sharp check, and at that moment\r\nRoss was still hesitating whether to attack Washington. The loss of\r\na few hundred men might have turned the scale at any moment during\r\nTuesday, August 23; but Winder neither fought nor retreated, but once\r\nmore passed the day on scout. At noon he rode with a troop of cavalry\r\ntoward Marlboro. Satisfied that the enemy was not in motion and would\r\nnot move that day, he started at one o’clock for Bladensburg, leaving\r\nhis army to itself. He wished to bring up a brigade of militia from\r\nBladensburg.[220]\r\n\r\nWinder had ridden about five miles, when the British at two o’clock\r\nsuddenly broke up their camp and marched directly on the Old Fields.\r\nThe American army hastily formed in line, and sent off its baggage to\r\nWashington. Winder was summoned back in haste, and arrived on the field\r\nat five o’clock as the British appeared. He ordered a retreat. Every\r\nmilitary reason required a retreat to Bladensburg. Winder directed a\r\nretreat on Washington by the navy-yard bridge.\r\n\r\nThe reasons which actuated him to prefer the navy-yard to Bladensburg,\r\nas explained by him, consisted in anxiety for the safety of that\r\n“direct and important pass,” which could not without hazard be left\r\nunguarded.[221] In order to guard a bridge a quarter of a mile long\r\nover an impassable river covered by the guns of war-vessels and the\r\nnavy-yard, he left unguarded the open high-road which led through\r\nBladensburg directly to the Capitol and the White House. After a very\r\nrapid retreat that “literally became a run of eight miles,”[222]\r\nWinder encamped in Washington near the bridge-head at the navy-yard\r\nat eight o’clock that night, and then rode three miles to the White\r\nHouse to report to the President. On returning to camp, he passed\r\nthe night until three or four o’clock in the morning making in\r\nperson arrangements to destroy the bridge “when necessary,” assuring\r\nhis officers that he expected the enemy to attempt a passage there\r\nthat night.[223] Toward dawn he lay down, exhausted by performing a\r\nsubaltern’s duty all day, and snatched an hour or two of sleep.\r\n\r\nThe British in their camp that evening were about eight miles from\r\nBladensburg battle-field. Winder was about five miles distant from\r\nthe same point. By a quick march at dawn he might still have arrived\r\nthere, with six hours to spare for arranging his defence. He preferred\r\nto wait till he should know with certainty that the British were on\r\ntheir way there. On the morning of Wednesday, August 24, he wrote to\r\nArmstrong:[224]--\r\n\r\n   “I have found it necessary to establish my headquarters here,\r\n   the most advanced position convenient to the troops, and nearest\r\n   information. I shall remain stationary as much as possible, that\r\n   I may be the more readily found, to issue orders, and collect\r\n   together the various detachments of militia, and give them as\r\n   rapid a consolidation and organization as possible.... The\r\n   news up the river is very threatening. Barney’s or some other\r\n   force should occupy the batteries at Greenleaf’s Point and the\r\n   navy-yard. I should be glad of the assistance of counsel from\r\n   yourself and the Government. If more convenient, I should make\r\n   an exertion to go to you the first opportunity.”\r\n\r\nThis singular note was carried first to the President, who, having\r\nopened and read it, immediately rode to headquarters. Monroe, Jones,\r\nand Rush followed. Armstrong and Campbell arrived last. Before\r\nArmstrong appeared, a scout arrived at ten o’clock with information\r\nthat the British army had broken up its camp at daylight, and was\r\nprobably more than half way to Bladensburg.[225]\r\n\r\nWinder’s persistence in remaining at the navy-yard was explained as\r\ndue to the idea that the enemy might move toward the Potomac, seize\r\nFort Washington or Warburton, secure the passage of his ships, and\r\napproach the city by the river.[226] The general never explained how\r\nhis presence at the navy-yard was to prevent such a movement if it was\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe whole eastern side of Washington was covered by a broad estuary\r\ncalled the Eastern Branch of the Potomac, bridged only at two points,\r\nand impassable, even by pontoons, without ample warning. From the\r\nPotomac River to Bladensburg, a distance of about seven miles, the\r\ncity was effectually protected. Bladensburg made the point of a right\r\nangle. There the Baltimore road entered the city as by a pass; for\r\nbeyond, to the west, no general would venture to enter, leaving an\r\nenemy at Bladensburg in his rear. Roads were wanting, and the country\r\nwas difficult. Through Bladensburg the attacking army must come; to\r\nBladensburg Winder must go, unless he meant to retreat to Georgetown,\r\nor to re-cross the Eastern Branch in the enemy’s rear. Monroe notified\r\nSerurier Monday evening that the battle would be fought at Bladensburg.\r\nSecretary Jones wrote to Commodore Rodgers, Tuesday morning, that the\r\nBritish would probably “advance to-day toward Bladensburg.”[227] Every\r\none looked instinctively to that spot[228], yet Winder to the last\r\ninstant persisted in watching the navy-yard bridge, using the hours of\r\nWednesday morning to post Barney’s sailors with twenty-four-pound guns\r\nto cover an approach[229] where no enemy could cross.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    MAP OF THE\r\n    BATTLE\r\n    OF\r\n    BLADENSBURG\r\n\r\n    STRUTHERS & CO., ENGR’S, N. Y.]\r\n\r\nNo sooner did Winder receive intelligence at ten o’clock Wednesday\r\nmorning that the British were in march to Bladensburg, than in the\r\nutmost haste he started for the same point, preceded by Monroe and\r\nfollowed by the President and the rest of the Cabinet and the troops.\r\nBarney’s sailors and their guns would have been left behind to guard\r\nthe navy-yard bridge had Secretary Jones not yielded to Barney’s\r\nvigorous though disrespectful remonstrances, and allowed him to\r\nfollow.[230]\r\n\r\nIn a long line the various corps, with their military and civil\r\ncommanders, streamed toward Bladensburg, racing with the British, ten\r\nmiles away, to arrive first on the field of battle. Monroe was earliest\r\non the ground. Between eleven and twelve o’clock he reached the spot\r\nwhere hills slope gently toward the Eastern Branch a mile or more in\r\nbroad incline, the little straggling town of Bladensburg opposite,\r\nbeyond a shallow stream, and hills and woods in the distance. Several\r\nmilitia corps were already camped on the ground, which had been from\r\nthe first designated as the point of concentration. A Baltimore\r\nbrigade, more than two thousand strong, had arrived there thirty-six\r\nhours before. Some Maryland regiments arrived at the same time with\r\nMonroe. About three thousand men were then on the field, and their\r\nofficers were endeavoring to form them in line of battle. General\r\nStansbury of the Baltimore brigade made such an arrangement as he\r\nthought best. Monroe, who had no military rank, altered it without\r\nStansbury’s knowledge.[231] General Winder arrived at noon, and rode\r\nabout the field. At the same time the British light brigade made its\r\nappearance, and wound down the opposite road, a mile away, a long\r\ncolumn of redcoats, six abreast, moving with the quick regularity, of\r\nold soldiers,[232] and striking directly at the American centre. They\r\nreached the village on one side of the stream as Winder’s troops poured\r\ndown the hill on the other; and the President with two or three of his\r\nCabinet officers, considerably in advance of all their own troops,\r\nnearly rode across the bridge into the British line, when a volunteer\r\nscout warned them of their danger.[233]\r\n\r\nMuch the larger portion of the American force arrived on the ground\r\nwhen the enemy was in sight, and were hastily drawn up in line wherever\r\nthey could be placed.[234] They had no cover. Colonel Wadsworth’s\r\nintrenchments were not used,[235] except in the case of one field-work\r\nwhich enfiladed the bridge at close range, where field-pieces were\r\nplaced. Although some seven thousand men were present, nothing\r\ndeserving the name of an army existed. “A few companies only,”\r\nsaid the Subaltern, “perhaps two or at the most three battalions,\r\nwearing the blue jacket which the Americans have borrowed from the\r\nFrench, presented some appearance of regular troops. The rest seemed\r\ncountry-people, who would have been much more appropriately employed\r\nin attending to their agricultural occupations than in standing\r\nwith muskets in their hands on the brow of a bare, green hill.”\r\nHeterogeneous as the force was, it would have been sufficient had it\r\nenjoyed the advantage of a commander.\r\n\r\nThe British light brigade, some twelve or fifteen hundred men, under\r\nColonel Thornton of the Eighty-fifth regiment, without waiting for the\r\nrear division, dashed across the bridge, and were met by a discharge of\r\nartillery and musketry directly in their face. Checked for an instant,\r\nthey pressed on, crossed the bridge or waded the stream, and spread to\r\nthe right and left, while their rockets flew into the American lines.\r\nAlmost instantly a portion of the American line gave way; but the rest\r\nstood firm, and drove the British skirmishers back under a heavy fire\r\nto the cover of the bank with its trees and shrubs. Not until a fresh\r\nBritish regiment, moving well to the right, forded the stream and\r\nthreatened to turn the American left, did the rout begin. Even then\r\nseveral strong corps stood steady, and in good order retired by the\r\nroad that led to the Capitol; but the mass, struck by panic, streamed\r\nwestward toward Georgetown and Rockville.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Barney’s sailors, though on the run, could not reach the\r\nfield in time for the attack, and halted on the hillside, about a\r\nmile from Bladensburg, at a spot just outside the District line. The\r\nrout had then begun, but Barney put his five pieces in position and\r\nwaited for the enemy. The American infantry and cavalry that had not\r\nfled westward moved confusedly past the field where the sailors stood\r\nat their guns. Winder sent Barney no orders, and Barney, who was not\r\nacting under Winder, but was commander-in-chief of his own forces under\r\nauthority of the Navy Department, had no idea of running away. Four\r\nhundred men against four thousand were odds too great even for sailors,\r\nbut a battle was not wholly disgraceful that produced such a commander\r\nand such men. Barney’s account of the combat was as excellent as his\r\ncourage:[236]--\r\n\r\n   “At length the enemy made his appearance on the main road in\r\n   force and in front of my battery, and on seeing us made a halt.\r\n   I reserved our fire. In a few minutes the enemy again advanced,\r\n   when I ordered an eighteen-pounder to be fired, which completely\r\n   cleared the road; shortly after, a second and a third attempt\r\n   was made by the enemy to come forward, but all were destroyed.\r\n   They then crossed over into an open field, and attempted to\r\n   flank our right. He was met there by three twelve-pounders, the\r\n   marines under Captain Miller, and my men acting as infantry,\r\n   and again was totally cut up. By this time not a vestige of the\r\n   American army remained, except a body of five or six hundred\r\n   posted on a height on my right, from which I expected much\r\n   support from their fine situation.”\r\n\r\nSuch a battle could not long continue. The British turned Barney’s\r\nright; the corps on the height broke and fled,[237] and the British,\r\ngetting into the rear, fired down upon the sailors. The British\r\nthemselves were most outspoken in praise of Barney’s men. “Not only did\r\nthey serve their guns with a quickness and precision that astonished\r\ntheir assailants,” said the Subaltern, “but they stood till some of\r\nthem were actually bayoneted with fuses in their hands; nor was it till\r\ntheir leader was wounded and taken, and they saw themselves deserted\r\non all sides by the soldiers, that they left the field.” Barney held\r\nhis position nearly half an hour, and then, being severely wounded,\r\nordered his officers to leave him where he lay. There he was taken by\r\nthe British advance, and carried to their hospital at Bladensburg.\r\nThe British officers, admiring his gallantry, treated him, he said,\r\n“with the most marked attention, respect, and politeness as if I was\r\na brother,”--as though to show their opinion that Barney instead of\r\nWinder should have led the American army.\r\n\r\nAfter the sailors retired, at about four o’clock, the British stopped\r\ntwo hours to rest. Their victory, easy as it seemed, was not cheaply\r\nbought. General Ross officially reported sixty-four killed and one\r\nhundred and eighty-five wounded.[238] A loss of two hundred and fifty\r\nmen among fifteen hundred said to be engaged[239] was not small; but\r\nGleig, an officer of the light brigade, himself wounded, made twice,\r\nat long intervals, an assertion which he must have intended as a\r\ncontradiction of the official report. “The loss on the part of the\r\nEnglish was severe,” he said,[240] “since out of two thirds of the\r\narmy which were engaged upward of five hundred men were killed and\r\nwounded.” According to this assertion, Ross lost five hundred men among\r\nthree thousand engaged, or one in six. Had Winder inflicted that loss\r\nwhile the British were still on the Patuxent, Ross would have thought\r\nlong before risking more, especially as Colonel Thornton was among the\r\nseverely injured. The Americans reported only twenty-six killed and\r\nfifty-one wounded.\r\n\r\nAt six o’clock, after a rest of two hours, the British troops resumed\r\ntheir march; but night fell before they reached the first houses of\r\nthe town. As Ross and Cockburn, with a few officers, advanced before\r\nthe troops, some men, supposed to have been Barney’s sailors, fired\r\non the party from the house formerly occupied by Gallatin, at the\r\nnortheast corner of Capitol Square. Ross’s horse was killed, and the\r\ngeneral ordered the house to be burned, which was done. The army did\r\nnot enter the town, but camped at eight o’clock a quarter of a mile\r\neast of the Capitol. Troops were then detailed to burn the Capitol,\r\nand as the great building burst into flames, Ross and Cockburn, with\r\nabout two hundred men, marched silently in the darkness to the White\r\nHouse, and set fire to it. At the same time Commodore Tingey, by\r\norder of Secretary Jones, set fire to the navy-yard and the vessels\r\nin the Eastern Branch. Before midnight the flames of three great\r\nconflagrations made the whole country light, and from the distant\r\nhills of Maryland and Virginia the flying President and Cabinet caught\r\nglimpses of the ruin their incompetence had caused.\r\n\r\nSerurier lived then in the house built by John Tayloe in 1800, called\r\nthe Octagon, a few hundred yards from the War and Navy Departments and\r\nthe White House.[241] He was almost the only civil official left in\r\nWashington, and hastened to report the event to Talleyrand:[242]--\r\n\r\n   “I never saw a scene at once more terrible and more magnificent.\r\n   Your Highness, knowing the picturesque nature and the grandeur\r\n   of the surroundings, can form an idea of it. A profound darkness\r\n   reigned in the part of the city that I occupy, and we were\r\n   left to conjectures and to the lying reports of negroes as to\r\n   what was passing in the quarter illuminated by these frightful\r\n   flames. At eleven o’clock a colonel, preceded by torches, was\r\n   seen to take the direction of the White House, which is situated\r\n   quite near mine; the negroes reported that it was to be burned,\r\n   as well as all those pertaining to government offices. I thought\r\n   best, on the moment, to send one of my people to the general\r\n   with a letter, in which I begged him to send a guard to the\r\n   house of the Ambassador of France to protect it.... My messenger\r\n   found General Ross in the White House, where he was collecting\r\n   in the drawing-room all the furniture to be found, and was\r\n   preparing to set fire to it. The general made answer that the\r\n   King’s Hotel should be respected as much as though his Majesty\r\n   were there in person; that he would give orders to that effect;\r\n   and that if he was still in Washington the next day, he would\r\n   have the pleasure to call on me.”\r\n\r\nRoss and Cockburn alone among military officers, during more than\r\ntwenty years of war, considered their duty to involve personal\r\nincendiarism. At the time and subsequently various motives were\r\nattributed to them,--such as the duty of retaliation,--none of which\r\nwas alleged by either of them as their warranty.[243] They burned the\r\nCapitol, the White House, and the Department buildings because they\r\nthought it proper, as they would have burned a negro kraal or a den\r\nof pirates. Apparently they assumed as a matter of course that the\r\nAmerican government stood beyond the pale of civilization; and in truth\r\na government which showed so little capacity to defend its capital,\r\ncould hardly wonder at whatever treatment it received.\r\n\r\nA violent thunder-storm checked the flames; but the next morning,\r\nThursday, August 25, fresh detachments of troops were sent to complete\r\nthe destruction of public property. Without orders from his Government,\r\nRoss converted his campaign, which till then had been creditable to\r\nhimself and flattering to British pride, into a marauding raid of which\r\nno sensible Englishman spoke without mortification. Cockburn amused\r\nhimself by revenging his personal grievances on the press which had\r\nabused him. Mounted on a brood mare, white, uncurried, with a black\r\nfoal trotting by her side, the Admiral attacked the office of the\r\n“National Intelligencer,” and superintended the destruction of the\r\ntypes. “Be sure that all the C’s are destroyed,” he ordered, “so that\r\nthe rascals cannot any longer abuse my name.”[244] Ross was anxious\r\nto complete the destruction of the public buildings with the least\r\npossible delay, that the army might retire without loss of time;[245]\r\nand the work was pressed with extreme haste. A few private buildings\r\nwere burned, but as a rule private property was respected, and no\r\ntroops except small detachments were allowed to leave the camp.\r\n\r\nSoon after noon, while the work was still incomplete, a tornado burst\r\non the city and put an end to the effort. An accidental explosion at\r\nthe navy-yard helped to check destruction. Ross could do no more, and\r\nwas in haste to get away. No sooner had the hurricane, which lasted\r\nnearly two hours and seemed especially violent at the camp, passed\r\nover, than Ross began preparations to retire. With precautions wholly\r\nunnecessary, leaving its camp-fires burning, the British column in\r\nextreme silence, after nine o’clock at night, began its march. Passing\r\nBladensburg, where the dead were still unburied, Ross left his wounded\r\nin the hospital to American care, and marched all night till seven\r\no’clock Friday morning, when the troops, exhausted with fatigue, were\r\nallowed a rest. At noon they were again in motion, and at night-fall,\r\nafter marching twenty-five miles within twenty-four hours, they arrived\r\nat Marlboro. Had the advance from Benedict been equally rapid, Ross\r\nwould have entered Washington without a skirmish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHILE Ross and Cockburn were hastily burning the White House\r\nand the Department buildings, anxious only to escape, and never sending\r\nmore than two hundred soldiers beyond Capitol Square, the President,\r\nhis Cabinet, his generals, and his army were performing movements at\r\nwhich even the American people, though outraged and exasperated beyond\r\nendurance, could not but laugh.\r\n\r\nThe President, after riding over the battle-field until the action\r\nbegan, remarked to Monroe and Armstrong that “it would be now proper\r\nfor us to retire in the rear, leaving the military movement to\r\nmilitary men,” which they did.[246] A moment afterward the left of the\r\nline gave way, and the panic-stricken militia poured along the road\r\nleading westward toward the point which in later times became known\r\nas the Soldier’s Home. The President retired with them, “continuing\r\nto move slowly toward the city,” according to Monroe, in company with\r\nAttorney-General Rush. The slowness of movement, on which Monroe seemed\r\nto lay stress, was compensated by steadiness. The President left\r\nBladensburg battle-field toward two o’clock. He had already ridden in\r\nthe early morning from the White House to the navy-yard, and thence to\r\nBladensburg,--a distance of eight miles at the least. He had six miles\r\nto ride, on a very hot August day, over a road encumbered by fugitives.\r\nHe was sixty-three years old, and had that day already been in the\r\nsaddle since eight o’clock in the morning, probably without food. Soon\r\nafter three o’clock he reached the White House, where all was confusion\r\nand flight.[247] He had agreed with his Cabinet, in case of disaster,\r\nto meet them at Frederick in Maryland, fifty miles away, but he did\r\nnot go toward Frederick. Before six o’clock he crossed the Potomac in\r\na boat from the White House grounds, and started by carriage westward,\r\napparently intending to join his wife and accompany her to his\r\nresidence at Montpelier in Loudoun County, adjoining Frederick County,\r\non the south side of the Potomac. Secretary Jones, Attorney-General\r\nRush, and one or two other gentlemen accompanied him. In the midst of a\r\ntroop of fugitives they travelled till dark, and went about ten miles,\r\npassing the night at a house “a few miles above the lower falls.”[248]\r\n\r\nThe next morning, August 25, the President travelled about six miles\r\nand joined his wife at an inn on the same road, where he remained\r\nduring the tornado, subjected to no little discomfort and some insult\r\nfrom fugitives who thought themselves betrayed. Although far beyond\r\nreach of the British troops and some twenty miles from their camp, the\r\npanic was still so great as to cause an alarm on the following night,\r\nwhich drove Madison from his bed for refuge in the Virginia woods,[249]\r\nat the time when Ross’s army, more than twenty miles distant, was\r\nmarching at the utmost speed in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nOf all the rulers, monarchical or republican, whose capitals were\r\noccupied by hostile armies in the Napoleonic wars, Madison was\r\npersonally the most roughly treated. Monroe’s adventures were not\r\nless mortifying. As a scout the Secretary of State’s services were\r\nhardly so valuable as those of a common trooper, for he was obliged\r\nto be more cautious; as a general, his interference with the order of\r\nbattle at Bladensburg led to sharp criticisms from General Stansbury,\r\nwhose arrangements he altered,[250] and to the epithet of “busy and\r\nblundering tactician” from Armstrong.[251] After the battle he was\r\nnot less busy, and opinions greatly differed whether he was less\r\nblundering. He did not return to the White House with Madison, but\r\njoined Winder and rode with him to the Capitol, where he assented to\r\nan evacuation, and retired after the flying troops through Georgetown,\r\npassing the night on the Maryland side of the Potomac. The next\r\nmorning, August 25, he crossed the river and overtook the President.\r\nAfter an interview with him, Monroe recrossed the river to Winder’s\r\nheadquarters at Montgomery Court House, where he resumed military\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury, G. W. Campbell, on the morning of the\r\nbattle went to the Cabinet meeting at the navy-yard, but his health,\r\nwhich had become much affected, obliged him to return to his lodgings\r\ninstead of riding to Bladensburg. In parting from Madison, Campbell\r\nlent him a pair of pistols, which the President put in his holsters.\r\nFederalists were curious to know whether the pistols were the same\r\nwith which he shot Barent Gardenier, but learned only that they were\r\nfine duelling pistols, and that they were stolen from the President’s\r\nholsters during his short stay at the White House after the battle. The\r\nsecretary’s duelling pistols became the best known of all the weapons\r\nunused that day; but the secretary himself made no further appearance\r\non the scene. He went to Frederick. The Secretary of the Navy and the\r\nAttorney-General accompanied the President, and shared his fortunes.\r\n\r\nAlthough ridicule without end was showered on the President and the\r\nother civilians, their conduct was on the whole creditable to their\r\ncourage and character; but of the commanding general no kind word\r\ncould be said. Neither William Hull, Alexander Smyth, Dearborn,\r\nWilkinson, nor Winchester showed such incapacity as Winder either\r\nto organize, fortify, fight, or escape. When he might have prepared\r\ndefences, he acted as scout; when he might have fought, he still\r\nscouted; when he retreated, he retreated in the wrong direction;\r\nwhen he fought, he thought only of retreat; and whether scouting,\r\nretreating, or fighting, he never betrayed an idea. In the brief\r\nmoment of his preparations on the field at Bladensburg he found time\r\nto give the characteristic order to his artillery: “When you retreat,\r\ntake notice that you must retreat by the Georgetown road.”[252] When\r\nhe left the field of Bladensburg he rode past Barney’s sailors, at\r\ntheir guns, and sent his aid to Colonel Beall, on the hill covering\r\nBarney’s right, with an order to retreat.[253] “After accompanying the\r\nretreating army within two miles of the Capitol, I rode forward for the\r\npurpose of selecting a position.”[254] He reached the Capitol first,\r\nand was presently joined there by Monroe and Armstrong. Having decided\r\nnot to fight at the Capitol, or at any point between the Capitol and\r\nGeorgetown, he rode to Georgetown.[255] Behind Rock Creek his army\r\nwould have been safe, and he could certainly have rallied more than\r\na thousand men to stop the panic; but he thought a farther retreat\r\nnecessary, and went on to the heights. On the heights nothing could\r\nreach him without hours of warning, but he rode three miles farther to\r\nTenallytown. At Tenallytown his exhausted men stopped a moment from\r\ninability to run farther, yet he seemed angry at their fatigue. Struck\r\nby a fresh panic at the glare of the burning city, he pressed his men\r\non at midnight. “After waiting in this position [Tenallytown] until I\r\nsupposed I collected all the force that could be gathered, I proceeded\r\nabout five miles farther on the river road, which leads a little wide\r\nto the left of Montgomery Court House, and in the morning gave orders\r\nfor the whole to assemble at Montgomery Court House.” The river road\r\nwas the road that led farthest from the enemy westward, when every\r\nmotive required retreat toward Baltimore if anywhere. The next morning\r\nWinder returned to the Rockville road, till he reached Rockville, or\r\nMontgomery Court House, sixteen miles from Washington, where at last he\r\npaused.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning to the end of the campaign Winder showed no military\r\nquality. In other respects his conduct tallied with his behavior in\r\nthe field. He lost no opportunity of throwing responsibility on the\r\nPresident and on his troops, and he so far succeeded as to save himself\r\nfrom public anger by encouraging the idea that the President and the\r\nCabinet had directed the campaign. Universal as that belief was,\r\nand continued to be, it was without foundation. While Winder courted\r\nadvice from every quarter, and threw on the President at every instant\r\nthe responsibility for every movement, neither the President nor the\r\nCabinet showed a disposition to interfere with his authority in any way\r\nexcept to give the support he asked. Under the strongest temptation\r\nthey abstained even from criticism.\r\n\r\nMore than all the rest, Armstrong refrained from interference with\r\nthe movements of Winder. Of all the unfortunate or incapable generals\r\nof the war, Winder was the one whom Armstrong treated with least\r\nbitterness,[256] although he was not Armstrong’s choice, and was\r\nthe direct cause of the secretary’s ruin. So careful was Armstrong\r\nnot to interfere, that his non-interference became the chief charge\r\nagainst him. At one moment the President told the secretary that he\r\ninterfered too much, at another moment that he should interfere more;\r\nbut in truth Armstrong was the only man connected with the defence of\r\nWashington whom no one charged with being ridiculous. After August 20\r\nhis conduct was not open to reproach. He was cool when others were\r\nexcited; he tried to check the panic; his suggestions were sensible; he\r\ngave all possible aid both to Winder and to the citizens; he attended\r\nthe President in his expeditions, used wisely such power as he had,\r\nand indulged in few words.[257] At the President’s request he went\r\nto Bladensburg to support and assist Winder; at the President’s order\r\nhe retired after the battle began. He returned, after Winder, to the\r\nCapitol, hoping to convert that strong building into a fortress,--a\r\nmeasure not unreasonable, if the regulars and sailors were rallied to\r\nmake a stand there. When Winder decided to retire to Georgetown, the\r\nsecretary acquiesced without a word. Then, in pursuance of a Cabinet\r\ndecision made a few hours before, he set out in company with Secretary\r\nCampbell for Frederick, and arrived there in the course of the next day.\r\n\r\nArmstrong and Campbell were at Frederick when the British army began\r\nits retreat Thursday night; the President was in Virginia, sixteen\r\nmiles up the river; Winder and Monroe, with the remaining troops,\r\nwere at Montgomery Court House sixteen miles from Washington.\r\nThere they learned, Friday morning, that the British had marched\r\ntoward Bladensburg, probably going to Baltimore; and at about ten\r\no’clock in the morning Winder marched from Montgomery Court House\r\ntoward Brookville and Baltimore with all his force. Passing through\r\nBrookville, they camped, Friday night, “about half way between\r\nMontgomery Court House and Ellicott’s upper mills,”[258] and Winder\r\nthere left them, starting late that evening alone for Baltimore, and\r\nleaving Monroe and Stansbury in command, with directions to follow.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the President had crossed the Potomac that morning, expecting\r\nto find Winder and Monroe at Montgomery Court House; but on arriving\r\nthere at six o’clock in the evening, and learning that the army had\r\nmarched toward Baltimore, he followed as far as Brookville, about ten\r\nmiles, where he passed the night.[259] Attorney-General Rush was with\r\nhim. Saturday morning, August 27, the President sent notes to all his\r\nCabinet requesting them to unite in Washington.[260] The same afternoon\r\nhe returned with Monroe and Rush to the city, which they reached at\r\nabout six o’clock, after three days’ absence.\r\n\r\nArmstrong and Campbell, ignorant of the change in plan, waited at\r\nFrederick for the President’s arrival, while the President and\r\nMonroe, Sunday, August 28, began the task of restoring the functions\r\nof government. The task was difficult, not so much on account of the\r\nBritish ravages, which had been confined to public property, as on\r\naccount of the general irritation and the continued panic. Hardly had\r\nRoss’s army disappeared when a squadron of British war-vessels, under\r\nCaptain Gordon of the frigate “Seahorse,” worked its way up the river,\r\napproaching Fort Washington or Warburton August 27. The commander of\r\nthat post, misunderstanding his orders, abandoned it and crossed the\r\nriver with his men. Gordon’s squadron reached Alexandria the next day,\r\nand the town capitulated, since it could not resist. Until August 31\r\nthe frigates remained at Alexandria, loading such vessels as were there\r\nwith the tobacco and other produce which the warehouses contained.[261]\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Washington and Georgetown, expecting to be visited\r\nin their turn, and conscious of their inability to resist, talked\r\nof a capitulation. Public feeling ran strong against the President.\r\nArmstrong was absent. Winder was at Baltimore. Monroe alone was in a\r\nposition to act, and upon Monroe the President was obliged to depend.\r\n\r\n   “Under these circumstances,” said Monroe in the only authentic\r\n   account of the event which remains,[262] “the President\r\n   requested Mr. Monroe to take charge of the Department of War\r\n   and command of the District _ad interim_, with which he\r\n   immediately complied. On the 28th, in the morning, the President\r\n   with Mr. Monroe and the Attorney-General visited the navy-yard,\r\n   the arsenal at Greenleaf’s Point, and passing along the shore of\r\n   the Potomac up toward Georgetown. Mr. Monroe, as Secretary of\r\n   War and military commander, adopted measures under sanction of\r\n   the President for the defence of the city and of Georgetown.”\r\n\r\nColonel W[adsworth?] who was placing some guns on the opposite shore\r\nrefused to obey an order of Monroe to change their position. Monroe\r\nrode across the bridge and gave the order in person. The colonel\r\nreplied that he did not know Mr. Monroe as Secretary of War or\r\ncommanding general. Monroe ordered him to obey or leave the field, and\r\nthe colonel left the field.\r\n\r\nMonroe’s act, whether such was his intention or not, was a _coup\r\nd’état_. The citizens, unable to punish the President, were\r\nrabid against Armstrong. No one could deny that they had reason for\r\ntheir anger, although the blame for their misfortunes was so evenly\r\ndistributed between every officer and every branch of government that\r\na single victim could not justly be selected for punishment. Monroe,\r\ninstead of giving to Armstrong in his absence such support as might\r\nhave sustained him, took a position and exercised an authority that\r\nled necessarily to his overthrow. The influence of such acts on the\r\ncitizens was obvious. That evening the first brigade of militia held a\r\nmeeting, and passed a formal and unanimous resolution that they would\r\nno longer serve under the orders or military administration of General\r\nArmstrong, whom they denounced as the willing cause of the fate of\r\nWashington.[263] This mutinous resolution, adopted in the immediate\r\npresence of the enemy, was taken to the President by two officers of\r\nthe brigade, one of whom at least was a strong friend of Monroe.[264]\r\n\r\nThe resolution of the first brigade was communicated to the President\r\nthe next morning, Monday, August 29. All the President’s recorded acts\r\nand conversation for months after the capture of Washington implied\r\nthat he was greatly shaken by that disaster. He showed his prostration\r\nby helplessness. He allowed Monroe for the first time to control him;\r\nbut he did not dismiss Armstrong. At one o’clock on the afternoon\r\nof the same day the Secretary of War arrived in Washington.[265]\r\nThe President that evening rode to his lodgings. Madison preserved\r\na memorandum of their conversation, and Armstrong also immediately\r\nafterward recorded what passed.[266] The President described to the\r\nsecretary the violent prejudices which existed in the city against\r\nthe Administration, and especially against himself and the Secretary\r\nof War. “Before his arrival there was less difficulty, as Mr. Monroe,\r\nwho was very acceptable to them, had, as on preceding occasions of\r\nhis absence, though very reluctantly on this, been the medium for the\r\nfunctions of Secretary of War;” but since Armstrong had returned,\r\nsomething must be done.\r\n\r\nArmstrong replied that he was aware of the excitement, and knew its\r\nsources; that evidently he could not remain if his functions were\r\nexercised by any one else; that he would resign, or retire from\r\nWashington at once, as the President preferred.\r\n\r\nMadison deprecated resignation, and recommended “a temporary\r\nretirement, as he suggested;” and after some further conversation, in\r\nwhich the President complained of the secretary’s mistakes, they parted\r\nwith the understanding that Armstrong should leave Washington the next\r\nmorning. Armstrong behaved with dignity and with his usual pride; but\r\nhe understood, if Madison did not, the necessary consequences of his\r\nretirement, and on reaching Baltimore sent his resignation to the\r\nPresident. At the same time he announced it to the public in a letter,\r\ndated September 3, containing comments on the weakness of Madison’s\r\nconduct calculated to close their relations.\r\n\r\nBetween conscious intrigue and unconscious instinct no clear line of\r\ndivision was ever drawn. Monroe, by the one method or the other, gained\r\nhis point and drove Armstrong from the Cabinet; but the suspicion\r\nthat he had intrigued for that object troubled his mind to the day\r\nof his death.[267] Even after Armstrong’s departure, the dangers and\r\ndisadvantages of appointing Monroe his successor were so great that for\r\nthree weeks the post remained unfilled, until, after many doubts and\r\nhesitations, Monroe wrote to Madison a letter claiming the appointment\r\nof Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n   “I have thought much of the state of the Departments at this\r\n   time,” he informed the President, September 25,[268] “and of\r\n   the persons whom it may be proper to place in them, and have\r\n   concluded that whatever may be the arrangement with respect to\r\n   other Departments, the Department of War ought to be immediately\r\n   filled. I think also that I ought to take charge of it.... By\r\n   taking charge of the Department twice, and withdrawing from\r\n   it a second time, it may be inferred that I shrink from the\r\n   responsibility from a fear of injuring my reputation; and this\r\n   may countenance the idea that the removal of the others was an\r\n   affair of intrigue in which I partook, especially in the latter\r\n   instance, from selfish and improper motives, and did not proceed\r\n   from his incompetency or misconduct. It seems due, therefore,\r\n   to my own reputation to go through with the undertaking by\r\n   accepting permanently a trust which I have not sought, never\r\n   wished, and is attended with great responsibility and hazard. By\r\n   taking the place, all clamor will be silenced. It is known, here\r\n   at least, that I was put into it when the other could no longer\r\n   hold it. Those who wished it in the first instance will be\r\n   satisfied, and I shall go on with your support and a favorable\r\n   expectation of the public that I shall discharge to advantage\r\n   its duties.”\r\n\r\nWhile Monroe in private communications with Madison thus treated\r\nArmstrong’s retirement as a “removal,” due to his “incompetency or\r\nmisconduct,” and Madison apparently acquiesced in that view, in public\r\nMadison seemed inclined to convey the idea that Armstrong was not\r\nremoved or meant to be removed from office, but rather deserted it.\r\nWhichever view was correct, Madison certainly dreaded the political\r\neffect of appearing to remove Armstrong; and while he gave to Monroe\r\nthe appointment of Secretary of War, he wrote, September 29, to\r\nGovernor Tompkins of New York, offering him the State Department.\r\n\r\nGovernor Tompkins declined the offer. Apart from the great need of\r\nhis services as governor, the experience of Northern men in Virginia\r\nCabinets was not calculated to encourage any aspirant to the Presidency\r\nin seeking the position. Monroe remained Secretary of State as well as\r\nSecretary of War. As Secretary of State he had little or nothing to do,\r\nwhich was partly the cause of his activity in military matters; but as\r\nSecretary of War he was obliged to undertake a task beyond the powers\r\nof any man.\r\n\r\nDuring an entire month after the appearance of the British in the\r\nPatuxent, the United States government performed few or none of its\r\nfunctions. The war on the frontiers was conducted without orders from\r\nWashington. Every energy of the government was concentrated on its own\r\nimmediate dangers, as though Washington were a beleaguered fortress.\r\nSlowly the tide of war ebbed from the Potomac and Chesapeake, and not\r\nuntil it had wholly subsided could men cease to dread its possible\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nCaptain Gordon’s squadron began its descent of the river September 1,\r\ngreatly annoyed[269] by batteries erected on the banks by Commodore\r\nRodgers, Perry, and Porter, who were sent from Baltimore, by order of\r\nSecretary Jones, for the purpose. Not until September 6 did Captain\r\nGordon escape from his perilous position and rejoin the fleet.\r\nMeanwhile the shores of Chesapeake Bay continued to be ravaged with\r\nall the severity threatened by Cochrane. Frederick Chamier, afterward\r\nthe author of several popular sea-stories, was then a lieutenant on\r\nthe “Menelaus” in Cochrane’s squadron, and his recollections in “The\r\nLife of a Sailor” gave a lively picture of the marauding in which\r\nhe took part.[270] Like Napier, Chamier was too tender-hearted for\r\nhis work. “I am willing to make oath,” he wrote, in reply to Captain\r\nScott’s contradictions, “that on the day that the ‘Menelaus’ entered\r\nthe Potomac, three houses were burning at the same time on the\r\nleft-hand bank of the river. We burnt more than five ourselves.” War\r\nwas commonly accompanied by destruction, but the war in the Chesapeake\r\nwas remarkable for the personal share taken by the highest officers,\r\nespecially by Cockburn and Ross, in directing the actual operation of\r\nsetting fire to private and public property.[271]\r\n\r\nAt last the practice caused a disaster that cost the British navy a\r\nlife more valuable than all the property it could destroy or carry\r\naway. The “Menelaus,” commanded by Sir Peter Parker, was sent up\r\nChesapeake Bay to divert attention from the general movement of troops\r\nand ships on the Potomac.[272] The “Menelaus” took position off the\r\nSassafras River, which Cockburn had cleared of vessels the year before.\r\nNothing in the river could injure the navy, but the “Menelaus” was\r\nordered to make a diversion; and Sir Peter Parker learned from negroes\r\nthat two hundred militia, encamped behind a wood half a mile from the\r\nbeach, intended to cross the bay for the protection of Baltimore.[273]\r\nOne hundred and twenty-four men were landed at eleven o’clock on the\r\nnight of August 30, and went in search of the militia. Instead of half\r\na mile, they were led by their guides three or four miles, and at last\r\nfound the militia drawn up, ready to receive them. Sir Peter Parker\r\nordered an attack, and while cheering it on in the moonlight was struck\r\nby a buckshot, which severed the femoral artery. The sailors carried\r\nhim back to the ship, but he died long before reaching it.[274] His\r\nparty escaped with a loss of thirteen killed and twenty-seven wounded\r\nbesides their captain.\r\n\r\nThe Americans regretted only that the punishment had fallen on the\r\nwrong person, for Cochrane and Cockburn rather than Parker were the\r\ntrue marauders; but the lesson was effectual, and the British became\r\nmore cautious after Parker’s death. Indeed, their activity in the\r\nChesapeake centred thenceforward in an effort to capture Baltimore,\r\nwhich required all their strength.\r\n\r\nBaltimore should have been first attacked, but Cockburn’s influence by\r\ndiverting Ross to Washington gave the larger city time to prepare its\r\ndefence. The citizens themselves, headed by the mayor, took charge of\r\nthe preparations; and their first act, contrary to the course pursued\r\nby Armstrong and Winder at Washington, was to construct intrenchments\r\nround the city, and to erect semi-circular batteries at a number of\r\npoints, mounted with cannon and connected by a line of works. After the\r\ncapture of Washington the citizens toiled still more earnestly at their\r\ntask, until a formidable line of redoubts protected the town, and,\r\nthough not wholly finished, gave cover to the militia. The batteries\r\nwere manned by sailors, commanded by officers of the navy. The harbor\r\nwas protected by Fort McHenry, small but capable of defence, and\r\noccupied by a strong force of regular troops, sailors, and volunteer\r\nartillerists numbering about one thousand, under the command of\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Armistead of the Artillery.[275]\r\n\r\nThese precautions made the capture of Baltimore impossible by such\r\na force as had taken Washington, even though aided by the fleet.\r\nThe precise number of troops present in the city, according to the\r\nofficial return for September 10, was twelve thousand nine hundred and\r\nninety-one men present for duty, with eight hundred and ninety-seven\r\nofficers. The aggregate of present and absent was sixteen thousand\r\neight hundred and five men.[276] The force was ample to man the works,\r\nbut the fortifications chiefly decided the result. No army on either\r\nside during the war succeeded in storming works in face, except by\r\nsurprise; and to turn the works of Baltimore a larger army was required\r\nthan Ross had at his command.\r\n\r\nThe militia major-general commanding at Baltimore was no other than\r\nSamuel Smith, senator of the United States. He had lately passed his\r\nsixty-second year. The brigadier-general in the United States service\r\nwho commanded the military district was W. H. Winder, whose defence of\r\nWashington ended abruptly August 24, and who left that neighborhood on\r\nthe evening of August 26 to take command of the defences of Baltimore.\r\nWinder was a Baltimore lawyer, only three years Smith’s junior, when\r\nEustis and Madison gave him a regiment in March, 1812. Smith was not\r\ndisposed to accept the idea of subordination to a man of inferior\r\nrank, military and civil, who knew no more of war than Smith knew,\r\nand whose career had been twice marked by unusual ridicule. Winder on\r\narriving in Baltimore notified Smith that he should take command, and\r\nwas astonished when the senator declined to surrender his authority.\r\nWinder appealed to the President and to the governor of Maryland, his\r\ncousin Levin Winder; but nothing could be done to assist him, and in\r\nthe end he submitted. Samuel Smith remained in command.\r\n\r\nThe British leaders having succeeded in turning their demonstration\r\nup the Patuxent into an attack on Washington, next decided to make “a\r\ndemonstration upon the city of Baltimore, which might be converted\r\ninto a real attack should circumstances appear to justify it,”[277]\r\nand sailed from the Potomac September 6 for the Patapsco River. They\r\nanchored September 11 off its mouth. From that point Ross’s army when\r\nlanded had only fourteen miles to march, and no water in their way,\r\nwhile Cochrane’s fleet had but twelve miles to sail. Compared with the\r\napproaches to Washington, the approach to Baltimore was easy.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    MILITARY TOPOGRAPHY\r\n    OF\r\n    BALTIMORE\r\n    AND ITS VICINITY\r\n    AND OF\r\n    PATAPSCO NECK\r\n    TO\r\n    NORTH POINT\r\n    BY ORDER OF\r\n    BRIG. GEN. W. H. WINDER\r\n\r\n    1814.]\r\n\r\nRoss’s troops were all landed at daylight on the northern point,\r\nand were in motion by eight o’clock September 12, without\r\nfiring a shot. Their numbers were differently given by British\r\nauthorities,--one reporting them at three thousand two hundred and\r\nseventy rank-and-file;[278] the other reckoning them at upward of five\r\nthousand.[279] Ross made on the Patapsco no such leisurely movements\r\nas on the Patuxent, but began his march at once, and proceeded about\r\nfive miles without meeting resistance. The light brigade with the\r\nEighty-fifth regiment was in advance; the second brigade, under Colonel\r\nBrooke of the Forty-fourth, followed; and the third brigade, under\r\nColonel Patterson of the Twenty-first, formed the rear. At the same\r\ntime the fleet moved up the channel toward Fort Henry.\r\n\r\nThe city was naturally excited at the news that the British had\r\narrived. General Smith, on receiving the intelligence September 11,\r\ndetached a brigade of Baltimore militia, under General Stricker, to\r\ncheck the enemy if possible, and Stricker advanced that evening about\r\nseven miles toward North Point. His force numbered about three thousand\r\ntwo hundred men;[280] and with that body of raw militia, a part of\r\nwhom had been routed at Bladensburg only a fortnight before, General\r\nStricker attempted to fight a battle with five thousand old soldiers.\r\nOn the morning of September 12 he formed his troops in three lines\r\nthree hundred yards apart, apparently in close order, without cover\r\nor protection of any kind, standing in fields more or less open, and\r\nwith an exposed flank.[281] Of all his arrangements, the only one\r\nwhich showed ordinary caution was to send a detachment of cavalry\r\nand riflemen a mile or two in his front. As the British advance\r\napproached, the American outposts fell back, and General Stricker sent\r\nforward some four hundred men, partly rifles, as skirmishers. The\r\nBritish advanced guard coming up, the skirmishing party fired, but was\r\nsoon driven back. Ross and Cockburn were walking together with the\r\nadvance, and after the firing ceased, Ross turned back alone to order\r\nup the light companies in anticipation of more serious resistance. On\r\nhis way he was shot through the breast from the wood, and fell in the\r\nroad, where he lay till he was found by the light companies hurrying\r\nforward to the scene of the firing. He barely spoke afterward.[282]\r\n\r\nThe loss of their commanding general was the second heavy penalty\r\npaid by the British for their contempt of militia. Colonel Brooke\r\nimmediately took command, and the advance was not checked; but the loss\r\nwas not the less serious. When Brooke saw Stricker’s line stretching\r\nacross the field, he did not dash at them at once with the light\r\nbrigade as Thornton had attacked the larger force and stronger position\r\nat Bladensburg, but deployed the whole army and formed a regular order\r\nof battle. Although his force easily overlapped and outflanked the\r\nAmerican, the engagement that followed was sharp, and the Americans\r\nwere not routed without considerable loss to the British, who reported\r\nforty-six killed and two hundred and seventy-three wounded,--or more\r\nthan they reported at Bladensburg. The Americans, though routed,\r\nsuffered less, losing only twenty-four killed, one hundred and\r\nthirty-nine wounded, and fifty prisoners, with two field-pieces.\r\n\r\nThis spirited little battle detained the British so long that they\r\nbivouacked on the field, and passed the night in a drenching rain,\r\nresuming their march the next morning, September 13, when they found\r\nthe roads obstructed, and were obliged to move so slowly that evening\r\narrived before they came in sight of Baltimore.[283] When at last\r\nthey saw on the distant heights the long line of intrenchments that\r\nsurrounded Baltimore on the side of their approach, they stopped short.\r\nColonel Brooke had gone forward with the advance, and was engaged all\r\nday, at about a mile and a half distance, in studying the American\r\nlines. He made arrangements for a night attack, hoping to avoid the\r\neffects of the American artillery,[284] and then waited for the fleet\r\nto support him.\r\n\r\nThe fleet all day bombarded the forts and batteries that covered\r\nthe entrance to the harbor, and continued the bombardment till past\r\nmidnight. Unlike most naval engagements during the war, this battle was\r\nharmless to either party. The heavier British ships feared to approach\r\nwithin range, owing to a barrier of sunken vessels, covered by the guns\r\non shore and by gunboats. Without the heavy ships, the lighter vessels\r\ncould not maintain a position. The fort sustained no great injury, and\r\nonly four men were killed and twenty-four wounded.[285] The fleet as\r\nfar as was reported sustained no injury whatever. The firing ceased\r\ntoward midnight, and Admiral Cochrane sent word to Colonel Brooke that\r\nhe could do no more.[286]\r\n\r\n   “Under these circumstances,” reported Colonel Brooke, “and\r\n   keeping in view your Lordship’s instructions, it was agreed\r\n   between the Vice-admiral and myself that the capture of the town\r\n   would not have been a sufficient equivalent to the loss which\r\n   might probably be sustained in storming the heights.”\r\n\r\nSir George Prevost at Plattsburg only two days before, with three times\r\nthe number of troops and a much smaller number of opponents, came to\r\nthe same conclusion. That both officers were probably wise was shown\r\nby the experience of Lieutenant-General Drummond, a month earlier,\r\nin attempting to storm the lines of Fort Erie. Brooke and Prevost\r\nfollowed the same course in another respect, for Brooke withdrew his\r\narmy so rapidly that at noon of September 14 it had already passed the\r\nbattle-field of two days before, and in another day the whole force was\r\nre-embarked.[287]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the wind allowed, the fleet returned to the lower\r\nChesapeake; and September 19 Admiral Cochrane sailed for Halifax to\r\nprepare for a new expedition. The troops remained till October 14 in\r\ntheir transports in the bay, and then set sail for Jamaica, leaving\r\nVirginia and Maryland to a long repose, which the vexed shores sorely\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER balancing gains and losses, the result of the campaign\r\nfavored Great Britain by the amount of plunder which the navy obtained\r\nin Alexandria, and by the posts which Governor Sherbrooke occupied\r\nbetween the Penobscot and the Passamaquoddy in Maine. Considering\r\nthe effort made and the waste of money, the result was a total\r\ndisappointment to the British people; but even these advantages on land\r\ncould not be regarded as secure until the British navy and mercantile\r\nmarine had summed up their profits and losses on the ocean.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the year 1814 the American navy had almost\r\ndisappeared. Porter in the “Essex” still annoyed British interests in\r\nthe Pacific; but of the five large frigates only the “President” was at\r\nsea. January 1 the “Constitution,” Captain Charles Stewart, left Boston\r\nand cruised southward, making a few prizes and destroying a British\r\nfourteen-gun schooner, but fighting no battle and effecting no object\r\nequivalent to her cost. In returning to Boston, April 3, she narrowly\r\nescaped capture by the two British frigates blockading the port, and\r\nwith difficulty got into Marblehead harbor. The “Constitution” did not\r\nagain go to sea until December 17. During her cruise of three months,\r\nfrom January 1 to April 3, she made four prizes.\r\n\r\nThe “President” regained New York February 18, and was blockaded during\r\nthe rest of the year. The “United States” and “Macedonian” remained\r\nblockaded at New London. The “Constellation” remained blockaded at\r\nNorfolk. The corvette “Adams,” twenty-eight guns, ran the blockade of\r\nChesapeake Bay January 18, and cruised until August 17, making nine\r\nprizes and several narrow escapes before striking on the Isle of Haut\r\nand taking refuge in the Penobscot as the British forces occupied\r\nCastine. The story of her destruction has been told. Her fate was\r\nthe same she would have met had she remained in Washington, where a\r\nweek earlier the new forty-four-gun frigate “Columbia” and the new\r\ntwenty-two-gun sloop-of-war “Argus” were burned to prevent them from\r\nfalling prize to the British army.\r\n\r\nThis short abstract accounted for all the frigates except the “Essex,”\r\nwhose fortune was no happier than that of the larger ships. October 27,\r\n1812, the “Essex,” Captain David Porter, left the Delaware, intending\r\nto meet Bainbridge and form part of a squadron under his command.\r\nFailing to meet Bainbridge, though constantly near him, Porter at last\r\ndecided to sail southward; and when Bainbridge in the “Constitution”\r\nreached Boston February 27, 1813, the “Essex” had already passed\r\nCape Horn, and was running up the western coast of South America to\r\nValparaiso.\r\n\r\nAt Valparaiso Porter arrived March 14, 1813, to the consternation of\r\ncommerce. Chili had recently asserted independence of Spain, and as\r\nyet no English war-vessels were stationed in the Pacific. The chief\r\nBritish interest was the whale fishery which centred in the Galapagos\r\nIslands,--a group lying under the equator, about a thousand miles from\r\nPanama. Although the influence of England was supreme, on account of\r\nher naval power, her commerce, and her political alliance with the\r\nSpanish people, and although Porter had neither a harbor of his own,\r\nnor the support of a diplomatic officer on the Pacific, he had nothing\r\nto fear. He was well received at Valparaiso, where since 1811 J. R.\r\nPoinsett had held the post of United States Consul-General for Buenos\r\nAyres, Chili, and Peru; but the “Essex” tarried only for supplies, and\r\nsoon sailed for the Galapagos Islands. There she arrived in April,\r\n1813, and in the course of the summer captured all the British whalers\r\nknown to be in those seas. These were twelve in number, and after\r\nsending some of them away, Porter still had a fleet of five armed ships\r\nbesides his own, and nothing more to do.\r\n\r\nThe “Essex” had then been a year at sea, and needed repairs. Porter\r\ndetermined to take his entire fleet of six vessels about three thousand\r\nmiles to the Marquesas Islands,--as though to make a voyage of\r\ndiscovery, or to emulate the mutineers of the “Bounty.” The squadron\r\nsailed three weeks over the southern seas, until, October 23, the\r\nMarquesas Islands were sighted. There Porter remained seven weeks,\r\namusing himself and his crew by intervention in native Marquesan\r\npolitics, ending in his conquest of the principal tribes, and taking\r\npossession of the chief island in the name of his Government. That he\r\nshould have brought away his whole crew after such relaxation, without\r\ndesertion, was surprising. The men were for a time in a state of mutiny\r\non being ordered to sea; but they did not desert, and the squadron\r\nsailed, Dec. 12, 1813, for Valparaiso.\r\n\r\nPorter would have done better to sail for the China seas or the Indian\r\nOcean. He knew that British war-vessels were searching for him, and\r\nthat Valparaiso was the spot where he would be directly in their way.\r\nHe arrived February 3, and five days afterward two British vessels\r\nof war sailed into the harbor, making directly for the “Essex” with\r\nthe appearance of intending to attack and board her. The crew of the\r\n“Essex” stood at quarters ready to fire as the larger ship ran close\r\nalongside, until her yards crossed those of the “Essex,” and Porter\r\nprobably regretted to the end of his life that he did not seize the\r\nopportunity his enemy gave him; but the British captain, from his\r\nquarter-deck only a few feet away, protested that the closeness of his\r\napproach was an accident, and that he intended no attack. The moment\r\nquickly passed, and then Porter found himself overmatched.\r\n\r\nThe British frigate “Phœbe,” thirty-six guns, had sailed from England\r\nin March, 1813, under secret orders to break up the United States\r\nfur-establishment on the Columbia River.[288] At Rio Janeiro the\r\n“Phœbe” was joined by the “Cherub,” a sloop-of-war rated at eighteen\r\nguns, and both sailed in search of the “Essex.” The “Phœbe” was\r\none hundred and forty-three and three quarters feet in length, by\r\nthirty-eight and a quarter in breadth; the “Essex” was one hundred and\r\nthirty-eight and a half feet in length, and thirty-seven and a quarter\r\nin breadth. The “Phœbe” carried a crew of three hundred men and boys;\r\nthe “Essex” carried two hundred and fifty-five. The “Essex” was the\r\nbetter sailer, and the result of an action depended on her ability to\r\nuse this advantage. The broadside of the “Essex” consisted of seventeen\r\nthirty-two-pound carronades and six long twelve-pounders; the “Phœbe”\r\nshowed only eight carronades, but had thirteen long eighteen-pounders,\r\none long twelve-pounder, and one long nine-pounder. At close range,\r\nPorter’s battery would overpower the “Phœbe’s” long guns, but the\r\n“Phœbe’s” thirteen long-range eighteen-pounders could destroy her enemy\r\nwithout receiving a shot in return. Porter knew all this, and knew also\r\nthat he could not depend on Chilian protection. No British captain\r\nin such a situation could afford to be delicate in regard to the\r\nneutrality of Chili, which was not even a recognized nation. At most\r\nPorter could hope for immunity only in the port of Valparaiso.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hillyar of the “Phœbe” made no mistakes. During an entire month\r\nhe blockaded the “Essex” with his two vessels, acting with extreme\r\ncaution. At last Porter determined to run out, trusting to a chase to\r\nseparate the blockading cruisers; and March 28, 1814, with a strong\r\nsoutherly wind, he got under way. As he rounded the outermost point a\r\nviolent squall carried away his maintopmast. The loss threw on Porter\r\na sudden emergency and a difficult, instantaneous decision. He decided\r\nto return to harbor. A young midshipman, David Farragut, who made his\r\nfirst cruise in the “Essex,” gave his high authority in after years to\r\nthe opinion that Porter’s decision was wrong. “Being greatly superior\r\nin sailing powers,” said Farragut, “we should have borne up, and run\r\nbefore the wind.” The chance of outsailing the “Phœbe,” or separating\r\nher from her consort, was better than that of regaining the anchorage.\r\n\r\nThe wind did not allow of a return to port, and the “Essex” was run\r\ninto a small bay three miles from Valparaiso, and anchored within\r\npistol-shot of the shore. There Hillyar had her wholly at his mercy. At\r\nfirst he attacked somewhat timidly. Although Porter could bring only\r\nthree long twelve-pounders to bear, he damaged the “Phœbe’s” rigging\r\nuntil Hillyar, in half an hour, hauled off to repair the injury,--or,\r\naccording to Hillyar’s account, the “Phœbe” was prevented by the\r\nfreshness of the wind from holding a position.[289] Finally the “Phœbe”\r\nanchored, and began firing her broadsides of long eighteen-pounders\r\ninto the “Essex’s” quarter. The “Cherub” kept under way, using only\r\nher bow guns. Reply was impossible. The crew of the “Essex” fired what\r\nguns would bear, and got the ship under way; but the “Phœbe” kept her\r\ndistance, throwing thirteen eighteen-pound shot into the “Essex” every\r\nfive or ten minutes, until the “Essex” was cut to pieces and her decks\r\nwere shambles.\r\n\r\nThe last attack continued, according to Captain Hillyar, from 5.35 till\r\n6.20 P. M., when the “Essex” struck. The entire battle lasted\r\nfrom four o’clock until the surrender. The carnage was frightful and\r\nuseless. Porter declared that fifty-eight of his crew were killed.\r\nHillyar claimed one hundred and nineteen unwounded prisoners, while\r\nPorter declared the number of unwounded prisoners to be seventy-five.\r\nThe British ships, with five hundred men, lost only fifteen killed and\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the “Essex,” like the loss of the “Chesapeake” and “Argus,”\r\nwas unnecessary. Porter need not have gone to Valparaiso, or might have\r\ntried to run out at night, or might have fought, even after the loss\r\nof his maintopmast, under less disadvantage. The disaster completed\r\nthe unfortunate record of the frigates for the year. They made some\r\nsixteen prizes and busied many British cruisers, but won no victories\r\nand suffered one bloody defeat.\r\n\r\nThe sloops told a different story. Early in 1814 three of the new\r\nsloops-of-war were ready for sea,--the “Frolic,” the “Peacock,”\r\nand the “Wasp.” They were heavy vessels of their class, about one\r\nhundred and twenty feet long on the main-deck, and thirty-two feet\r\nin extreme breadth; carrying crews of about one hundred and sixty\r\nmen, with an armament of twenty thirty-two-pound carronades and two\r\nlong eighteen-pounders. Although only one third the tonnage of the\r\nforty-four-gun frigates, and carrying only one third the crew, the\r\nnew sloops-of-war threw nearly half the weight of metal,--for the\r\nbroadside of the “Constitution” commonly exceeded but little the\r\nweight of seven hundred pounds, while the sloops threw three hundred\r\nand thirty-eight. The difference was due not to the weight, but to\r\nthe range. The frigates carried thirty long twenty-four-pounders; the\r\nsloops carried only two long eighteen-pounders. The sloops were rigged\r\nas ships, and built with the usual solidity of war-vessels, costing\r\nabout seventy-five thousand dollars each.\r\n\r\nThe first to sail was the “Frolic,” from Boston, in February. She\r\ncaptured only two prizes before she was herself taken, April 20,\r\noff Matanzas, after a chase by the thirty-six-gun British frigate\r\n“Orpheus,” assisted by a twelve-gun schooner.\r\n\r\nThe second sloop-of-war, the “Peacock,” commanded by Lewis Warrington,\r\nsailed from New York in March. Warrington was a Virginian, thirty-two\r\nyears old and fourteen years in the service, with the rank of\r\nmaster-commandant in 1813. Cruising down the coast, the “Peacock” first\r\nran in to St. Mary’s on the Florida frontier; and then continuing\r\nsouthward, on the morning of April 29, off the Indian River Inlet, she\r\ndiscovered a small convoy on its way from Havana to Bermuda, under\r\ncharge of the British eighteen-gun brig “Epervier.” The British brig\r\nwas no match for the American ship. She was smaller, and carried only\r\nsixteen thirty-two and two eighteen-pound carronades, with a crew of\r\none hundred and three men and fifteen boys.[290] The inferiority was\r\nsomething like four to three; but Captain Wales of the “Epervier”\r\ngallantly brought his vessel into action at the usual close-range of\r\nthese murderous combats.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wales told the result in an official report, dated May 8, to\r\nVice-Admiral Cochrane.[291] The report was not published, the British\r\nAdmiralty having become sensitive to the popular outcry against their\r\nnaval management.\r\n\r\n   “At eight A. M.,” reported Captain Wales, “the wind\r\n   being about east-south-east, I saw a strange sail in the\r\n   southwest apparently in chase of us; at nine, perceiving her\r\n   to near very fast and to be a square-rigged vessel-of-war, I\r\n   shortened sail and hauled to the wind on the larboard tack\r\n   to be between her and the convoy, being rather ahead of them.\r\n   The wind at this time veering round to the southward enabled\r\n   the stranger to lay up for us.... At 9.50 A. M. we\r\n   weathered her and exchanged broadsides; having passed her beam,\r\n   we tacked, shortened sail, and continued in close action until\r\n   eleven A. M., when--five of our larboard guns being\r\n   disabled by the breeching-bolts giving way, and three others by\r\n   shot, and unable to manœuvre so as to get the starboard guns to\r\n   bear in consequence of the rigging and sails being cut to pieces\r\n   in the early part of the action by star-shot, the main boom shot\r\n   away, the foremast wounded in several places, and several shot\r\n   between wind and water, with four-and-a-half feet of water in\r\n   the hold, and the enemy seemingly in a state to continue the\r\n   action--I deemed it prudent to surrender.”\r\n\r\nThe giving way of the breeching-bolts did not wholly disable the guns,\r\nfor Captain Wales specially commended “Mr. Lawrence Kennedy the Purser,\r\nwho rendered much service in his exertions at the after-guns by getting\r\nthem in a fighting state again when unshipped by the fighting-bolts\r\ncoming out of their places.”\r\n\r\nAt the close of the battle the “Peacock’s” hull had not been touched;\r\naloft, her foreyard was disabled and a few upper stays were cut away;\r\nof her crew, two men were slightly wounded,--but this was all the\r\ninjury sustained in running for three quarters of an hour under the\r\nclose fire of nine heavy guns.[292] The “Epervier” was reported by\r\nCaptain Warrington as showing forty-five shot-holes in her hull;\r\nmasts and rigging much cut up, and twenty-three men killed or wounded\r\nin a crew of one hundred and twenty-eight. The difference between the\r\nforce of the two vessels amply accounted for the capture; but the\r\nAdmiralty might well show unwillingness to admit the bad condition of\r\nthe vessels-of-war to which it intrusted the duty of convoying British\r\nmercantile shipping.[293] So complete was the “Epervier’s” disaster\r\nthat no excuse was offered for it, except the plea that she was in\r\nalmost every respect inferior to the standard that British vessels of\r\nher class were supposed to maintain.\r\n\r\nCaptain Warrington saved the “Epervier” and brought her into Savannah\r\nin spite of two British frigates encountered on the way. He sailed\r\nagain early in June, and passed the months of July and August in\r\nBritish waters or in the track of British commerce from the Faroe\r\nIslands to the Canaries. He burned or sunk twelve prizes, besides\r\nmaking cartels of two more, and brought his ship through the blockade\r\ninto New York harbor, October 30, without injury, with only one man\r\nlost and the crew in fine health.[294]\r\n\r\nThe third new sloop was named the “Wasp” after the famous victor over\r\nthe “Hornet.” The new “Wasp” sailed from Portsmouth, New Hampshire,\r\nMay 1, under command of Johnston Blakeley. Born in Ireland in 1781,\r\nBlakeley was from infancy a North Carolinian. He became in 1800 an\r\nofficer in the navy. Blakeley and the “Wasp” of 1814, like Jones\r\nand the “Wasp” of 1813, ran a career in which tragedy gave a deeper\r\ntinge than usual to the bloody colors they won; but their success was\r\non the whole greater than that of any other national cruiser from\r\nthe beginning to the end of the war. Merely as a story of adventure\r\nBlakeley’s career was exciting, but romance was its smallest interest.\r\nFor several reasons the sloop battles and cruises afforded one of the\r\nbest relative tests of American character and skill among all that were\r\nfurnished in the early period of the national history; and among the\r\nsloops, Blakeley’s “Wasp” was the most distinguished.\r\n\r\nBlakeley ran directly across the ocean into soundings at the mouth\r\nof the British Channel. There he remained during the month of June,\r\nsearching every vessel that passed. The number of neutrals constantly\r\ndiverting his attention kept him actively employed, and led him farther\r\ninto the Channel than was intended; but although three British frigates\r\nand fourteen sloops were at sea for the protection of British waters,\r\nthe “Wasp” continued to burn and sink such British merchantmen as\r\nshe met,--the first, June 2, and subsequently June 13, 18, 23, and\r\n26,--until on the morning of June 28 a man-of-war brig appeared to\r\nwindward, and bore down on the American ship.\r\n\r\nThe day was warm and overcast. During the whole morning the two vessels\r\napproached each other so slowly that each had more than time to study\r\nhis opponent. Once more the foresight of the American ship-builders\r\nsecured a decisive advantage. The British brig, the “Reindeer,” was\r\naltogether unequal to the contest. In tonnage she resembled the\r\n“Epervier,” and her armament was even lighter. Captain Manners, her\r\ncommander, had substituted twenty-four-pound carronades for the usual\r\nthirty-two-pounders, and his broadside of ten guns threw only two\r\nhundred and ten pounds of metal,[295] while the “Wasp’s” eleven guns\r\nthrew three hundred and thirty-eight pounds. The American crew numbered\r\none hundred and seventy-three men; the British numbered one hundred\r\nand eighteen. Contest under such conditions was a forlorn hope, but\r\nthe “Reindeer’s” crew were the pride of Portsmouth, and Manners was\r\nthe idol of his men. They might cripple the “Wasp” if they could not\r\ncapture her; and probably the fate of the “Argus,” a year before,\r\nencouraged the hope that the “Reindeer” could do at least as well as\r\nthe “Pelican.”\r\n\r\nEach captain manœuvred for the weather-gauge, but the Englishman gained\r\nit, and coming up on the “Wasp’s” weather-quarter, repeatedly fired\r\nhis light twelve-pound bow-carronade, filled with round and grape\r\nshot, into the American ship. Blakeley, “finding the enemy did not get\r\nsufficiently on the beam to enable us to bring our guns to bear, put\r\nthe helm a-lee,” and fired as his guns bore. The firing began at 3.26\r\nP. M. and lasted until 3.40, fourteen minutes, at close range.\r\nIn that space of time each gun in the broadside could be fired at the\r\nutmost three times. Apparently Manners felt that he had no chance with\r\nhis guns, for he brought his vessel’s bow against the “Wasp’s” quarter\r\nand repeatedly attempted boarding. Early in the action the calves of\r\nhis legs were shot away; then a shot passed through both his thighs;\r\nyet he still climbed into the rigging to lead his boarders, when two\r\nballs at the same moment struck him in the head. His fall ended the\r\nbattle; and such had been the losses of his company that the highest\r\nofficer remaining unhurt on the British brig to surrender the vessel\r\nwas said to be the captain’s clerk. At 3.45 the “Reindeer’s” flag was\r\nstruck,--the whole action, from the “Wasp’s” first gun, having lasted\r\nnineteen minutes.\r\n\r\nHad every British vessel fought like the “Reindeer,” Englishmen would\r\nhave been less sensitive to defeat. In this desperate action the “Wasp”\r\nsuffered severely. Her foremast was shot through; her rigging and spars\r\nwere much injured; her hull was struck by six round shot and much\r\ngrape; eleven men were killed and fifteen wounded, or nearly one man in\r\nsix, “chiefly in repelling boarders,” reported Blakeley. The “Reindeer”\r\nwas a wreck, and was blown up as soon as the wounded could be removed.\r\nOf her crew, numbering one hundred and eighteen, thirty-three lost\r\ntheir lives; thirty-four were wounded,--in all, sixty-seven, or more\r\nthan half the brig’s complement.\r\n\r\nTen days afterward Blakeley ran into Lorient, where his ship was well\r\nreceived by the French, whose British antipathies were increased rather\r\nthan lessened by their enforced submission. After refitting, the “Wasp”\r\nsailed again August 27, and four days later cut out a valuable ship\r\nfrom a convoy under the eyes of a seventy-four. The same evening,\r\nSeptember 1, at half-past six, Blakeley sighted four vessels, two on\r\neither bow, and hauled up for the one most to windward. At 9.26 at\r\nnight the chase, a brig, was directly under the “Wasp’s” lee-bow, and\r\nBlakeley began firing a twelve-pound bow-carronade, which he must have\r\ntaken from the “Reindeer,” for no such gun made part of his regular\r\narmament.\r\n\r\nThe battle in the dark which followed has been always deeply\r\ninteresting to students of naval history, the more because the\r\nBritish Admiralty suppressed the official reports, and left an air of\r\nmystery over the defeat which rather magnified than diminished its\r\nproportions. The British brig was the sloop-of-war “Avon,” commanded\r\nby Captain James Arbuthnot, and carrying the usual armament of sixteen\r\nthirty-two-pound carronades with two long six-pounders. Her crew was\r\nreported as numbering one hundred and four men and thirteen boys.\r\nCaptain Arbuthnot’s official report[296] said that the “Avon” had\r\nbeen cruising in company with the sloop-of-war “Castilian,” when at\r\ndaylight, September 1, he “discovered an enemy’s schooner in the\r\nrear of the Kangaroo convoy,” and gave chase. The “Castilian” also\r\ngave chase, and at seven o’clock the twenty-gun ship “Tartarus” was\r\nsignalled, also in chase.[297] All day the three British sloops-of-war\r\nchased the privateer schooner, until at half-past six o’clock in the\r\nevening the “Castilian’s” superiority in sailing free left the “Avon”\r\nout of sight, nine miles astern. The position of the “Tartarus” was\r\nnot mentioned in the reports, but she could hardly have been ahead of\r\nthe “Castilian.” The three British sloops were then within ten miles\r\nof each other, under full sail, with a ten-knot wind. The weather was\r\nhazy, and neither the “Castilian” nor the “Tartarus” could see that the\r\n“Avon” was signalling the “Castilian” a recall. The “Avon” saw at four\r\no’clock a large sail on her weather-beam standing directly for her, and\r\nknowing that the “Wasp” was cruising in these waters, Captain Arbuthnot\r\nfelt natural anxiety to rejoin his consort.\r\n\r\nCaptain Arbuthnot’s report continued:--\r\n\r\n   “The stranger closing with us fast, I kept away and set the\r\n   weather studding-sails in hopes of nearing the ‘Castilian’\r\n   or ‘Tartarus,’ the latter of which I had only lost sight of\r\n   at 3 P. M. At 7.30 P. M. the stranger had\r\n   approached within hail, and being unable to get a satisfactory\r\n   answer I had not a doubt of her being an enemy’s corvette.\r\n   At 8.30 he fired a shot over us which was instantly returned\r\n   with a broadside. He then bore up and endeavored to rake us,\r\n   but was prevented. The action then became general within half\r\n   pistol-shot, and continued without intermission until 10.30\r\n   P. M., when--having seven feet of water in the hold,\r\n   the magazine drowned; tiller, foreyard, main-boom, and every\r\n   shroud shot away, and the other standing and the running rigging\r\n   cut to pieces; the brig quite unmanageable, and the leak gaining\r\n   fast on the pumps; with forty killed and wounded, and five of\r\n   the starboard guns dismounted; and conceiving further resistance\r\n   only would cause a useless sacrifice of lives--I was under the\r\n   painful necessity of ordering the colors to be struck to the\r\n   American corvette ‘Wasp,’ the mainmast, almost immediately\r\n   after, going over the side.”\r\n\r\nLieutenant George Lloyd, commanding the “Castilian,” reported September\r\n2 the circumstances attending the loss of the “Avon,” as far as they\r\nconcerned his share in the matter.[298] At nine o’clock the “Castilian”\r\nheard a very heavy firing in the north-northeast, and immediately\r\nwore and made all possible sail in that direction, burning blue\r\nlights. At quarter past ten the firing ceased, “and on coming up I\r\nhad the mortification to observe the ‘Avon’ a totally dismantled and\r\nungovernable wreck, with her mainmast gone,--the enemy, apparently a\r\nlarge ship corvette, lying to, to leeward of her, who on my closing\r\nmade all sail, and evinced every wish to avoid a contest with us.”\r\n\r\n   “I immediately used means to enable me to bring her to close\r\n   action; and from our superior sailing I had in a few minutes\r\n   the gratification to be within half a cable’s length on her\r\n   weather quarter. But I lament to state at this anxious crisis\r\n   the ‘Avon’s’ situation became most alarming; she had commenced\r\n   firing minute guns, and making every other signal of distress\r\n   and of being in want of immediate assistance. I must here\r\n   (as my pen can but inadequately describe) leave you, sir, to\r\n   judge the feelings of myself, officers, and crew, as, from the\r\n   confusion which evidently prevailed on board the enemy, the\r\n   damage she had sustained, and her bad steerage, together with\r\n   the cool and steady conduct of the officers and men I have the\r\n   honor to command, I had no doubt of her falling an easy prey\r\n   could we have persisted in attacking her, but which was not to\r\n   be done without sacrificing the lives of the surviving gallant\r\n   crew of our consort. Thus situated ... I was obliged ... to\r\n   leave the flying enemy to escape; but I feel somewhat gratified\r\n   the situation of the ‘Castilian’ enabled me to give him a\r\n   raking, and I doubt not from the closeness of the vessels a\r\n   most destructive broadside, which he did not return even with a\r\n   single gun,--a circumstance that, I trust, cannot fail to prove\r\n   how destructive the ‘Avon’s’ fire must have been.”\r\n\r\nLieutenant Lloyd did not explain how his enemy was to bring guns to\r\nbear under the circumstances, the “Castilian” tacking under the\r\n“Wasp’s” stern at half a cable’s length distance, and immediately\r\nstanding in the opposite direction, nor did he say what had become of\r\nthe “Tartarus.” Doubtless the “Wasp” steered badly, her rigging being\r\nmuch damaged; and Blakeley was chiefly intent on keeping off till he\r\ncould reeve new braces. The “Castilian’s” broadside cut the “Wasp’s”\r\nrigging and sails, and shot away a lower main cross-tree, but did no\r\nother serious damage.\r\n\r\nThe “Avon” lost ten men killed and thirty-two wounded, besides being\r\nreduced to a sinking condition in an hour of night action in a ten-knot\r\nwind, with two more ships-of-war in sight and hearing. The “Wasp” lost\r\ntwo men killed and one wounded, four round shot in the hull, and the\r\n“rigging and sails suffered a great deal.”[299]\r\n\r\nBlakeley had done enough, and could hardly do more. Besides two\r\neighteen-gun brigs, he made in his cruise fourteen prizes, which he\r\ndestroyed, several of great value. In that year all the frigates in\r\nthe United States service had not done as much. With a single-decked\r\nship of five hundred tons, armed with carronades, Blakeley blockaded\r\nthe British Channel for two months, capturing vessels in sight\r\nof ships-of-the-line, and destroying two sloops-of-war in rapid\r\nsuccession, without serious injury to himself, and to the consternation\r\nof the British marine.\r\n\r\nAfter sinking the “Avon,” September 1, Blakeley held on his course\r\ntoward Madeira, and there, September 21, captured the brig “Atlanta,”\r\nwhich he sent to Savannah. Still later, October 9, near the Cape de\r\nVerde Islands, he spoke a Swedish brig, which reported him. After that\r\nday no word of tidings was ever received from the “Wasp.” Somewhere\r\nunder the waters of the Atlantic, ship and crew found an unknown grave.\r\n\r\nBesides the large sloops-of-war, three smaller vessels--the\r\n“Syren,” “Enterprise,” and “Rattlesnake”--went to sea in 1814.\r\nThe “Syren” was captured after a chase of eleven hours, nearly\r\non a wind, by the “Medway,” seventy-four; her sixteen guns, and\r\neverything else that could be spared, were thrown overboard during\r\nthe chase. The “Rattlesnake” and “Enterprise” cruised in company\r\ntoward the West Indies, and made some prizes. The “Rattlesnake”\r\nwas fast, the “Enterprise” a very dull sailer; but after repeated\r\nhairbreadth escapes, the “Rattlesnake” was caught, July 11, by the\r\nfrigate “Leander,” with Cape Sable to windward, and was obliged to\r\nsurrender.[300] The “Enterprise,” with her usual good fortune, was\r\nnever taken, but became a guardship.\r\n\r\nAfter November 1 the United States government had not a ship at sea.\r\nIn port, three seventy-fours were building, and five forty-fours were\r\nbuilding or blockaded. Three thirty-six-gun frigates were laid up or\r\nblockaded. Four sloops-of-war were also in port, the “Peacock” having\r\njust returned from her long cruise. Such a result could not be called\r\nsatisfactory. The few war-vessels that existed proved rather what the\r\ngovernment might have done than what the British had to fear from any\r\nactual or probable American navy. The result of private enterprise\r\nshowed also how much more might easily have been done by government.\r\n\r\nThe year 1814 was marked by only one great and perhaps decisive success\r\non either side, except Macdonough’s victory. This single success was\r\nprivateering. Owners, captains, and crews had then learned to build\r\nand sail their vessels, and to hunt their prey with extraordinary\r\nskill. A few rich prizes stimulated the building of new vessels as\r\nthe old were captured, and the ship-yards turned them out as rapidly\r\nas they were wanted. In the neighborhood of Boston, in the summer of\r\n1814, three companion ships were built,--the “Reindeer,” “Avon,” and\r\n“Blakeley;” and of these the “Reindeer” was said to have been finished\r\nin thirty-five working days, and all three vessels were at sea in the\r\nfollowing winter. No blockade short of actual siege could prevent such\r\ncraft from running out and in. Scores of them were constantly on the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nOn the Atlantic privateers swarmed. British merchantmen were captured,\r\nrecaptured, and captured again, until they despaired of ever reaching\r\nport. One British master who was three times taken and as often\r\nretaken, reported that he had seen ten American privateers crossing\r\nhis course. A letter from Halifax printed in the London “Times” of\r\nDecember 19 said: “There are privateers off this harbor which plunder\r\nevery vessel coming in or going out, notwithstanding we have three\r\nline-of-battle ships, six frigates, and four sloops here.” The West\r\nIndies and the Canaries were haunted by privateers. The “Rambler,”\r\n“Hyder Ali,” and “Jacob Jones” of Boston penetrated even the Chinese\r\nseas, and carried prize-goods into Macao and Canton. Had these pests\r\nconfined their ravages to the colonies or the ocean, the London clubs\r\nand the lobbies of Parliament would have thought little about them;\r\nbut the privateer had discovered the weakness of Great Britain, and\r\nfrequented by preference the narrow seas which England regarded as her\r\nown. The quasi-blockade of the British coasts which American cruisers\r\nmaintained in 1813 became a real and serious blockade in 1814. Few days\r\npassed without bringing news of some inroad into British waters, until\r\nthe Thames itself seemed hardly safe.\r\n\r\nThe list of privateers that hung about Great Britain and Ireland\r\nmight be made long if the number were necessary to the story, but the\r\ncharacter of the blockade was proved by other evidence than that of\r\nnumbers. A few details were enough to satisfy even the English. The\r\n“Siren,” a schooner of less than two hundred tons, with seven guns and\r\nseventy-five men,[301] had an engagement with her Majesty’s cutter\r\n“Landrail” of four guns, as the cutter was crossing the British Channel\r\nwith despatches. The “Landrail” was captured after a somewhat sharp\r\naction, and sent to America, but was recaptured on the way. The victory\r\nwas not remarkable, but the place of capture was very significant;\r\nand it happened July 12, only a fortnight after Blakeley captured the\r\n“Reindeer” farther westward. The “Siren” was but one of many privateers\r\nin those waters. The “Governor Tompkins” burned fourteen vessels\r\nsuccessively in the British Channel. The “Young Wasp” of Philadelphia\r\ncruised nearly six months about the coasts of England and Spain and in\r\nthe course of West India commerce. The “Harpy” of Baltimore, another\r\nlarge vessel of some three hundred and fifty tons and fourteen guns,\r\ncruised nearly three months off the coast of Ireland, in the British\r\nChannel and in the Bay of Biscay, and returned safely to Boston filled\r\nwith plunder, including, as was said, upward of £100,000 in British\r\nTreasury notes and bills of exchange. The “Leo,” a Boston schooner of\r\nabout two hundred tons, was famous for its exploits in these waters,\r\nbut was captured at last by the frigate “Tiber” after a chase of eleven\r\nhours. The “Mammoth,” a Baltimore schooner of nearly four hundred tons,\r\nwas seventeen days off Cape Clear, the southernmost point of Ireland.\r\nThe most mischievous of all was the “Prince of Neufchatel” of New York,\r\nwhich chose the Irish Channel as its favorite haunt, where during the\r\nsummer it made ordinary coasting traffic impossible. The most impudent\r\nwas probably the “Chasseur,” commanded by Captain Boyle, who cruised\r\nthree months, and amused himself, when off the British coast, by\r\nsending to be posted at Lloyd’s a “Proclamation of Blockade” of “all\r\nthe ports, harbors, bays, creeks, rivers, inlets, outlets, islands,\r\nand sea-coast of the United Kingdom.” The jest at that moment was too\r\nsardonic to amuse the British public.\r\n\r\nAs the announcement of these annoyances, recurring day after day,\r\nbecame a practice of the press, the public began to grumble in louder\r\nand louder tones. “That the whole coast of Ireland, from Wexford round\r\nby Cape Clear to Carrickfergus,” said the “Morning Chronicle” of\r\nAugust 31, “should have been for above a month under the unresisted\r\ndominion of a few petty ‘fly-by-nights’ from the blockaded ports of the\r\nUnited States, is a grievance equally intolerable and disgraceful.”\r\nThe Administration mouthpiece, the “Courier,” admitted, August 22,\r\nthat five brigs had been taken in two days between the Smalls and\r\nthe Tuskar, and that insurance on vessels trading between Ireland\r\nand England had practically ceased. The “Annual Register” for 1814\r\nrecorded as “a most mortifying reflection,” that with a navy of nearly\r\na thousand ships of various sizes, and while at peace with all Europe,\r\n“it was not safe for a vessel to sail without convoy from one part of\r\nthe English or Irish Channel to another.” Such insecurity had not been\r\nknown in the recent wars.\r\n\r\nAs early as August 12, the London Assurance Corporations urged the\r\ngovernment to provide a naval force competent to cope with the\r\nprivateers. In September the merchants of Glasgow, Liverpool, and\r\nBristol held meetings, and addressed warm remonstrances to government\r\non the want of protection given to British commerce. The situation was\r\nserious, and the British merchants did not yet know all. Till that time\r\nthe East India and China trade had suffered little, but at last the\r\nAmerican privateers had penetrated even the Chinese seas; and while\r\nthey were driving the British flag into port there, they attacked the\r\nEast India Company’s ships, which were really men-of-war, on their\r\nregular voyages. In August the “Countess of Harcourt” of more than five\r\nhundred tons, carrying six heavy guns and ninety men, was captured in\r\nthe British Channel by the privateer “Sabine” of Baltimore, and sent\r\nsafely to America. The number and value of the prizes stimulated new\r\nenergy in seeking them, and British commerce must soon yield to that of\r\nneutral nations if the war continued.\r\n\r\nThe merchants showed that a great change had come over their minds\r\nsince they incited or permitted the Tories to issue the Impressment\r\nProclamation and the Orders in Council seven years before. More than\r\nany other class of persons, the ship-owners and West India merchants\r\nwere responsible for the temper which caused the war, and they were\r\nfirst to admit their punishment. At the Liverpool meeting, where Mr.\r\nGladstone, who took the chair, began by declaring that some ports,\r\nparticularly Milford, were under actual blockade,[302] a strong\r\naddress was voted; and at a very numerous meeting of merchants,\r\nmanufacturers, ship-owners, and underwriters at Glasgow, September 7,\r\nthe Lord Provost presiding, resolutions were unanimously passed--\r\n\r\n   “That the number of American privateers with which our channels\r\n   have been infested, the audacity with which they have approached\r\n   our coasts, and the success with which their enterprise has been\r\n   attended, have proved injurious to our commerce, humbling to our\r\n   pride, and discreditable to the directors of the naval power of\r\n   the British nation, whose flag till of late waved over every sea\r\n   and triumphed over every rival.\r\n\r\n   “That there is reason to believe, in the short space of\r\n   twenty-four months, above eight hundred vessels have been\r\n   captured by the Power whose maritime strength we have hitherto\r\n   impolitically held in contempt.”\r\n\r\nThe war was nearly at an end, and had effected every possible purpose\r\nfor the United States, when such language was adopted by the chief\r\ncommercial interests of Great Britain. Yet the Glasgow meeting\r\nexpressed only a part of the common feeling. The rates of insurance\r\ntold the whole story. The press averred that in August and September\r\nunderwriters at Lloyd’s could scarcely be induced to insure at any rate\r\nof premium, and that for the first time in history a rate of thirteen\r\nper cent had been paid on risks to cross the Irish Channel. Lloyd’s\r\nlist then showed eight hundred and twenty-five prizes lost to the\r\nAmericans, and their value seemed to increase rather than diminish.\r\n\r\nWeary as the merchants and ship-owners were of the war, their disgust\r\nwas not so intense as that of the navy. John Wilson Croker, Secretary\r\nof the Admiralty Board, whose feelings toward America were at best\r\nunkind, showed a temper that passed the limits of his duties. When\r\nthe London underwriters made their remonstrance of August 12, Croker\r\nassured them, in a letter dated August 19,[303] that at the time\r\nreferred to “there was a force adequate to the purpose of protecting\r\nthe trade both in St. George’s Channel and the Northern Sea.” The\r\nnews that arrived during the next two weeks threw ridicule on this\r\nassertion; and Croker was obliged to reply to a memorial from Bristol,\r\nSeptember 16, in a different tone.[304] He admitted that the navy had\r\nnot protected trade, and could not protect it; but he charged that the\r\nmerchants were to blame for losing their own ships. His letter was a\r\nvaluable evidence of the change in British sentiment:--\r\n\r\n   “Their Lordships take this opportunity of stating to you, for\r\n   the information of the memorialists, that from the accounts\r\n   which their Lordships have received of the description of\r\n   vessels which had formed the largest proportion of the captures\r\n   in the Irish and Bristol channels, it appears that if their\r\n   masters had availed themselves of the convoys appointed for\r\n   their protection from foreign ports, or had not in other\r\n   instances deserted from the convoys under whose protection they\r\n   had sailed, before the final conclusion of the voyage, many of\r\n   the captures would not have been made. It is their Lordships’\r\n   determination, as far as they may be enabled, to bring the\r\n   parties to punishment who may have been guilty of such illegal\r\n   acts, and which are attended with such injurious consequences to\r\n   the trade of the country.”\r\n\r\nLittle by little the Americans had repaid every item of the debt of\r\ninsult they owed, and after Croker’s letter the account could be\r\nconsidered settled. Even the “Times” was not likely to repeat its\r\nsneer of 1807, that the Americans could hardly cross to Staten Island\r\nwithout British permission. Croker’s official avowal that no vessel\r\ncould safely enter or leave one port in the British Islands for another\r\nexcept under guard of a man-of-war, was published on the same page with\r\nthe memorialists’ assertion that the rate of insurance had gradually\r\nrisen till it exceeded twofold the usual rates prevailing during the\r\nwars on the Continent.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of exasperation shown by Croker extended through the navy.\r\nThe conduct of Cochrane and Cockburn has been already told. That of\r\nCaptain Hillyar at Valparaiso was equally significant. Under the\r\nannoyance of their mortifications the British commanders broke through\r\nordinary rules. Captain Lloyd of the “Plantagenet,” seventy-four, on\r\narriving in the harbor of Fayal, September 26, saw a large brig in\r\nthe roads, which he must have known to be an American privateer. He\r\nwas so informed by his pilot. It was the “General Armstrong,” Captain\r\nSamuel C. Reid, a brig which for two years had fretted and escaped the\r\nBritish navy. The “Plantagenet,” with two other ships-of-war, appeared\r\nat sunset. Reid dared not run out to sea, and the want of wind would in\r\nany case have prevented success. A little after dusk, Reid, seeing the\r\nsuspicious movements of the enemy, began to warp his vessel close under\r\nthe guns of the castle. While doing so, at about eight o’clock four\r\nboats filled with men left the ships and approached him. As they came\r\nnear he repeatedly hailed and warned them off, and at last fired. His\r\nfire was returned, but the boats withdrew with the loss of a number of\r\nmen.[305]\r\n\r\nCaptain Lloyd, in a somewhat elaborate report to explain the propriety\r\nof his conduct, enclosed affidavits to prove that the Americans had\r\nviolated the neutrality of the port. The affidavits proved that,\r\nknowing the character of the vessel, he sent two boats from his own\r\nship to assist the boats of the “Carnation” to “watch” the privateer.\r\nHis report told the story as he wished it to be understood:[306]\r\n\r\n   “On the evening of the 26th instant I put into this port for\r\n   refreshments, previous to my return to Jamaica. In shore was\r\n   discovered a suspicious vessel at anchor. I ordered Captain\r\n   Bentham of the ‘Carnation’ to watch her movements, and sent the\r\n   pinnace and cutter of this ship to assist him on that service;\r\n   but on his perceiving her under way, he sent Lieut. Robert\r\n   Faussett in the pinnace, about eight o’clock, to observe her\r\n   proceedings. On his approaching the schooner, he was ordered to\r\n   keep off or they would fire into him, upon which the boat was\r\n   immediately backed off; but to his astonishment he received a\r\n   broadside of round, grape, and musketry, which did considerable\r\n   damage. He then repeatedly requested them to leave off firing,\r\n   as he was not come to molest them; but the enemy still continued\r\n   his destructive fire until they had killed two men and wounded\r\n   seven, without a musket being returned by the boat.”\r\n\r\nLieutenant Faussett’s affidavit threw more light on this curious story\r\nof British naval management. He deposed--\r\n\r\n   “That on Monday, the 26th instant, about eight o’clock in the\r\n   evening, he was ordered to go in the pinnace as guard-boat\r\n   unarmed on board her Majesty’s brig ‘Carnation,’ to know what\r\n   armed vessel was at anchor in the bay, when Captain Bentham of\r\n   said brig ordered him to go and inquire of said vessel (which\r\n   by information was said to be a privateer). When said boat\r\n   came near the privateer, they hailed (to say, the Americans),\r\n   and desired the English boat to keep off or they would fire\r\n   into her; upon which said Mr. Faussett ordered his men to\r\n   back astern, and with a boat-hook was in the act of so doing,\r\n   when the Americans in the most wanton manner fired into said\r\n   English boat, killed two men and wounded seven, some of them\r\n   mortally,--and this notwithstanding said Faussett frequently\r\n   called out not to murder them, that they struck and called for\r\n   quarter. Said Faussett solemnly declares that no resistance of\r\n   any kind was made, nor could they do it, not having any arms,\r\n   nor of course sent to attack said vessel.”\r\n\r\nLieutenant Faussett’s affidavit proved that the “General Armstrong”\r\nhad good reason for firing into the British boats. The “Carnation”\r\nhad anchored within pistol-shot of the privateer; four boats of the\r\n“Plantagenet” and “Carnation,” filled with men, were on the water\r\nwatching her in the moonlight; every act of the British squadron\r\npointed to an attack, when Captain Bentham ordered the pinnace “to go\r\nand inquire” of the vessel, known to be an American privateer, what\r\narmed vessel it was. If Captain Bentham did not intend to provoke\r\na shot from the privateer, his order was wanting in intelligence.\r\nLieutenant Faussett accordingly approached in the pinnace, the other\r\nboats being not far behind. That his men were unarmed was highly\r\nimprobable to the privateer, which affirmed that their fire killed\r\none of the American crew and wounded the first lieutenant;[307] but\r\ntheir armament had little to do with the matter. They approached as\r\nenemies, in the night, with a large armed force immediately behind\r\nthem. The privateer repeatedly warned them off. Instead of obeying the\r\norder, Lieutenant Faussett came alongside. When he was fired on, he\r\nwas so near that by his own account he shoved off with the boat-hook.\r\nConsidering who and where he was, he had reason to be thankful that any\r\nof his boat’s-crew escaped.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lloyd’s report continued:--\r\n\r\n   “This conduct, in violating the neutrality of this port, I\r\n   conceive left me no alternative but that of destroying her. I\r\n   therefore repeatedly ordered Captain Bentham to tow in the brig\r\n   and take that step immediately. All the boats of this ship and\r\n   the ‘Rota’ were sent under his orders to tow him alongside or\r\n   assist him in the attack, as circumstances might require; but\r\n   from continued light baffling winds and a lee tide he was not\r\n   able, as he informed me, with his utmost exertions to put my\r\n   orders in execution.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Captain Reid of the “General Armstrong” warped his vessel\r\nclose to the beach, under the fort, and made all his preparations for\r\nthe attack which he knew must come. The people of the town, with the\r\ngovernor among them, lined the shore, and witnessed the affair. Captain\r\nLloyd’s report told the result:--\r\n\r\n   “Finding the privateer was warping under the fort very fast,\r\n   Captain Bentham judged it prudent to lose no time, and about\r\n   twelve o’clock ordered the boats to make the attack. A more\r\n   gallant, determined one never was made, led on by Lieutenants\r\n   Matterface of the ‘Rota’ and Bowerbank of this ship; and every\r\n   officer and man displayed the greatest courage in the face of a\r\n   heavy discharge of great guns and musketry. But from her side\r\n   being on the rocks (which was not known at the time), and every\r\n   American in Fayal, exclusive of part of the crew, being armed\r\n   and concealed in these rocks, which were immediately over the\r\n   privateer, it unfortunately happened when these brave men gained\r\n   the deck they were under the painful necessity of returning to\r\n   their boats, from the very destructive fire kept up by those\r\n   above them from the shore, who were in complete security,--and I\r\n   am grieved to add, not before many lives were lost exclusive of\r\n   the wounded.”\r\n\r\nAs far as the accounts[308] agree, the boats were twelve in number,\r\nwith about two hundred men. The privateersmen numbered ninety. As the\r\nboats approached, the guns opened on them; and when they came alongside\r\nthe privateer they found the boarding-nettings up, with a desperate\r\ncrew behind. So vigorously did the British seamen attack, that they\r\ngained the forecastle for a time. All three American lieutenants were\r\nkilled or disabled, and Captain Reid fought his brig alone; but the\r\ndeck was at last cleared, and the surviving assailants dropped into\r\ntheir boats or into the water.\r\n\r\nProverbially, an unsuccessful boat-attack was the most fatal of all\r\nservices. The British loss was excessive. According to their report at\r\nthe time, “Lieutenants Bowerbank, Coswell, and Rogers of the ‘Rota’\r\nwere killed, as well as thirty-eight seamen, and eighty-three wounded;\r\nthe first, fourth, and fifth lieutenants of the ‘Plantagenet’ were\r\nwounded, and twenty-two seamen killed, and twenty-four wounded.[309]”\r\nAccording to the official report, thirty-four were killed and\r\neighty-six were wounded. The “Guerriere” in her battle with the\r\n“Constitution” lost only seventy-eight men altogether. The “Macedonian”\r\nlost only one hundred and four. The attack on the “General Armstrong”\r\nwas one of the bloodiest defeats suffered by the British navy in the\r\nwar. Not only was the privateer untaken, but she lost few of her\r\ncrew,--nine in all, killed and wounded.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lloyd then declared that he would destroy the privateer if he\r\nhad to destroy Fayal in doing it, and ordered Captain Bentham of the\r\n“Carnation” to attack her with his guns. Reid abandoned and scuttled\r\nthe “General Armstrong,” taking his men on shore. The “Carnation’s”\r\nshot inflicted some injury on the town, before the privateer was set on\r\nfire by the “Carnation’s” boats.[310]\r\n\r\nIf the British navy cared to pay such a price for the shell of an old\r\nprivateer brig, which had already cost British commerce, as Captain\r\nLloyd believed, a million dollars,[311] the privateers were willing to\r\ngratify the wish, as was shown a few days afterward when the “Endymion”\r\ntried to carry the “Prince of Neufchatel” by boarding. This privateer\r\nhad made itself peculiarly obnoxious to the British navy by the\r\nboldness of its ravages in British waters. It was coming to America\r\nfilled with plunder, and with a prize in company, when off Gay Head the\r\n“Endymion” was sighted, October 11, and gave chase.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hope of the “Endymion” made an official report, explaining with\r\nmuch detail that he chased the privateer till evening, when the wind\r\nfailed, and he then sent out his boats:[312]--\r\n\r\n   “I sent all the boats under command of Lieutenants Hawkins,\r\n   Ormond, and Fanshaw. In approaching the ship an alarm was\r\n   fired. The boats had been previously rowing up under a shoal,\r\n   and had not felt the effects of a rapid tide which they almost\r\n   instantaneously became exposed to. The second barge in taking\r\n   the station assigned by Lieutenant Hawkins on the schooner’s\r\n   starboard bow, having her larboard oars shot away, unfortunately\r\n   was swept by the stream athwart the first barge; thereby all\r\n   the boats became entangled; and it is with extreme concern I\r\n   acquaint you that the attack was in consequence at this moment\r\n   only partially made. Notwithstanding this disadvantage at the\r\n   first onset, every exertion that human skill could devise was\r\n   resorted to to renew the contest; and they succeeded in again\r\n   getting alongside, but not in the position intended. Their\r\n   failure, therefore, is to be ascribed in the first instance\r\n   to the velocity of the tide, the height of the vessel’s side,\r\n   not having channel plates to assist the men in getting on her\r\n   deck, and her very superior force (a schooner of the largest\r\n   dimensions, the ‘Prince of Neufchatel,’ three hundred and\r\n   twenty tons, eighteen guns, long-nine and twelve-pounders, with\r\n   a complement of one hundred and forty men of all nations,\r\n   commanded by Mons. Jean Ordronaux). The boats’ painters being\r\n   now shot away, they again fell astern without ever being able to\r\n   repeat the attack, and with great difficulty regained the ship,\r\n   with the exception of the second barge.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Ordronaux of the privateer had a crew of less than forty men\r\nthen at quarters, and they suffered severely, only nine men escaping\r\ninjury. The boarders gained the deck, but were killed as fast as they\r\nmounted; and at last more than half the British party were killed or\r\ncaptured. According to the British account, twenty-eight men, including\r\nthe first lieutenant of the “Endymion,” were killed; and thirty-seven\r\nmen, including the second lieutenant, were wounded.[313] This report\r\ndid not quite agree with that of the privateer, which claimed also\r\ntwenty-eight prisoners, including the second lieutenant, who was\r\nunhurt. In any case, more than seventy men of the “Endymion’s” crew,\r\nbesides her first and second lieutenant, were killed, wounded, or\r\ncaptured; and the “Prince of Neufchatel” arrived in safety in Boston.\r\n\r\nIn the want of adjacent rocks lined with armed Americans, such as\r\nCaptain Lloyd alleged at Fayal, Captain Hope was reduced to plead the\r\ntides as the cause of his defeat. These reports, better than any other\r\nevidence, showed the feelings of the British naval service in admitting\r\ndiscomfiture in the last resort of its pride. Successively obliged\r\nto plead inferiority at the guns, inferiority in sailing qualities,\r\ninferiority in equipment, the British service saw itself compelled\r\nby these repeated and bloody repulses to admit that its supposed\r\npre-eminence in hand-to-hand fighting was a delusion. Within a single\r\nfortnight two petty privateers, with crews whose united force did not\r\namount to one hundred and fifty men, succeeded in repulsing attacks\r\nmade by twice their number of the best British seamen, inflicting a\r\nloss, in killed and wounded, officially reported at one hundred and\r\neighty-five.\r\n\r\nSuch mortifying and bloody experiences made even the British navy weary\r\nof the war. Valuable prizes were few, and the service, especially in\r\nwinter, was severe. Undoubtedly the British cruisers caught privateers\r\nby dozens, and were as successful in the performance of their duties\r\nas ever they had been in any war in Europe. Their blockade of American\r\nports was real and ruinous, and nothing pretended to resist them. Yet\r\nafter catching scores of swift cruisers, they saw scores of faster\r\nand better vessels issue from the blockaded ports and harry British\r\ncommerce in every sea. Scolded by the press, worried by the Admiralty,\r\nand mortified by their own want of success, the British navy was\r\nobliged to hear language altogether strange to its experience.\r\n\r\n   “The American cruisers daily enter in among our convoys,” said\r\n   the “Times” of February 11, 1815, “seize prizes in sight of\r\n   those that should afford protection, and if pursued ‘put on\r\n   their sea-wings’ and laugh at the clumsy English pursuers. To\r\n   what is this owing? Cannot we build ships?... It must indeed he\r\n   encouraging to Mr. Madison to read the logs of his cruisers. If\r\n   they fight, they are sure to conquer; if they fly, they are sure\r\n   to escape.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the tempest of war that raged over land and ocean during\r\nthe months of August and September, 1814, bystanders could not trust\r\ntheir own judgment of the future; yet shrewd observers, little affected\r\neither by emotion or by interest, inclined to the belief that the\r\nUnited States government was near exhaustion. The immediate military\r\ndanger on Lake Champlain was escaped, and Baltimore was saved; but\r\nthe symptoms of approaching failure in government were not to be\r\nmistaken, and the capture of Washington, which was intended to hurry\r\nthe collapse, produced its intended effect.\r\n\r\nFrom the first day of the war the two instruments necessary for\r\nmilitary success were wanting to Madison,--money and men. After three\r\ncampaigns, the time came when both these wants must be supplied,\r\nor the national government must devolve its duties on the States.\r\nWhen the President, preparing his Annual Message, asked his Cabinet\r\nofficers what were the prospects of supplying money and men for another\r\ncampaign, he received answers discouraging in the extreme.\r\n\r\nFirst, in regard to money. In July, Secretary Campbell advertised a\r\nsecond loan, of only six million dollars. He obtained but two and a\r\nhalf millions at eighty. His acceptance of this trifling sum obliged\r\nhim to give the same terms to the contractors who had taken the nine\r\nmillions subscribed in the spring at eighty-eight. Barker found\r\ndifficulty in making his payments, and from both loans the Treasury\r\ncould expect to obtain only $10,400,000, owing to the contractors’\r\nfailures.[314] The authorized loan was twenty-five millions. The\r\nsecretary could suggest no expedient, except Treasury notes, for\r\nfilling the deficit.\r\n\r\nBad as this failure was,--though it showed Secretary Campbell’s\r\nincapacity so clearly as to compel his retirement, and obliged the\r\nPresident to call a special session of Congress,--the Treasury might\r\nregard it as the least of its embarrassments. Commonly governments\r\nhad begun their most desperate efforts only after ordinary resources\r\nfailed; but the United States government in 1814 had so inextricably\r\ninvolved its finances that without dictatorial powers of seizing\r\nproperty its functions could not much longer be continued. The general\r\nbankruptcy, long foreseen, at length occurred.\r\n\r\nThe panic caused by the capture of Washington, August 24, obliged\r\nthe tottering banks of Philadelphia and Baltimore to suspend specie\r\npayments. The banks of Philadelphia formally announced their\r\nsuspension, August 31, by a circular explaining the causes and\r\nnecessity of their decision.[315] The banks of New York immediately\r\nfollowed, September 1; and thenceforward no bank between New Orleans\r\nand Albany paid its obligations except in notes. Only the banks of\r\nNew England maintained specie payments, with the exception of those\r\nin least credit, which took the opportunity to pay or not pay as\r\nthey pleased. The suspension was admitted to be permanent. Until the\r\nblockade should be raised and domestic produce could find a foreign\r\nmarket, the course of exchange was fixed, and specie payments could\r\nnot be resumed. The British navy and the Boston Federalists held the\r\ncountry firmly bound, and peace alone could bring relief.\r\n\r\nSuspension mattered little, and had the National Bank been in existence\r\nthe failure might have been an advantage to the government; but without\r\na central authority the currency instantly fell into confusion. No\r\nmedium of exchange existed outside of New England. Boston gave the\r\nspecie standard, and soon the exchanges showed wide differences.\r\nNew York money stood at twenty per cent discount, Philadelphia at\r\ntwenty-four per cent, Baltimore at thirty per cent. Treasury notes\r\nwere sold in Boston at twenty-five per cent discount, and United\r\nStates six-per-cents stood at sixty in coin.[316] The Treasury had no\r\nmeans of transferring its bank deposits from one part of the country\r\nto another. Unless it paid its debts in Treasury notes, it was unable\r\nto pay them at all. No other money than the notes of suspended banks\r\ncame into the Treasury. Even in New England, taxes, customs-duties,\r\nand loans were paid in Treasury notes, and rarely in local currency.\r\nThus, while the government collected in the Middle and Southern States\r\nmillions in bank-notes, it was obliged to leave them in deposit at the\r\nlocal banks where the collection was made, while its debts in Boston\r\nand New York remained unpaid. The source of revenue was destroyed. The\r\nwhole South and West, and the Middle States as far north as New York,\r\ncould contribute in no considerable degree to the support of government.\r\n\r\nThe situation was unusual. The government might possess immense\r\nresources in one State and be totally bankrupt in another; it might\r\nlevy taxes to the amount of the whole circulating medium, and yet\r\nhave only its own notes available for payment of debt; it might\r\nborrow hundreds of millions and be none the better for the loan. All\r\nthe private bank-notes of Pennsylvania and the Southern country were\r\nuseless in New York and New England where they must chiefly be used. An\r\nattempt to transfer such deposits in any quantity would have made them\r\nquite worthless. The Treasury already admitted bankruptcy. The interest\r\non the national obligations could not be paid.\r\n\r\nThe President’s second inquiry regarded men. The new Secretary of War,\r\nMonroe, gave him such information as the Department possessed on the\r\nnumbers of the army. A comparative account showed that in June, 1813,\r\nthe regular troops numbered 27,609; in December, 34,325. In January,\r\n1814, the number was nominally 33,822;[317] in July the aggregate was\r\n31,503, the effectives being 27,010.[318] Since July the recruits had\r\ndeclined in numbers. The three months of March, April, and May produced\r\n6,996 recruits; the three months of July, August, and September were\r\nreported as furnishing 4,477.[319] The general return of September 30\r\nreported the strength of the army at 34,029 men.[320] The government\r\nwas not able to provide the money necessary to pay bounties due for\r\nthe last three months’ recruiting.[321] The Secretary of War admitted\r\nthe failure of the recruiting service, and attributed it to the high\r\nbounties given for substitutes in the militia detached for United\r\nStates service.[322]\r\n\r\nThe smallness of the armies in the field showed worse results than\r\nwere indicated by the returns. Macomb at Plattsburg claimed to have\r\nonly fifteen hundred effectives. Izard carried with him to Buffalo\r\nonly four thousand men. Brown’s effectives at Fort Erie numbered two\r\nthousand. Apparently these three corps included the entire force in the\r\nfield on the Canada frontier, and their combined effective strength did\r\nnot exceed eight thousand men. The year before, Wilkinson and Hampton\r\ncommanded fully eleven thousand effectives in their movements against\r\nMontreal. Nothing showed that the victories at Niagara and Plattsburg\r\nhad stimulated enlistments, or that the army could be raised above\r\nthirty thousand effectives even if the finances were in a condition to\r\nmeet the expense.\r\n\r\nMuch was said of the zeal shown by the State militia in hastening to\r\nthe defence of their soil, and the New England Federalists were as\r\nloud as the Kentucky and Tennessee Democrats in praise of the energy\r\nwith which the militia rose to resist invasion; but in reality this\r\nsymptom was the most alarming of the time. Both in the military and in\r\nthe political point of view, the persistence in depending on militia\r\nthreatened to ruin the national government.\r\n\r\nThe military experience of 1814 satisfied the stanchest war Democrats\r\nthat the militia must not be their dependence. In Maine the militia\r\nallowed themselves with hardly a show of resistance to be made\r\nsubjects of Great Britain. At Plattsburg volunteers collected in\r\nconsiderable numbers, but the victory was won by the sailors and the\r\nengineers. At Niagara, Brown never could induce more than a thousand\r\nvolunteers to support him in his utmost straits. Porter’s efforts\r\nfailed to create a brigade respectable in numbers, and at Chippawa\r\nhis Indians outnumbered his whites. Four days after the repulse\r\nof Drummond’s assault on Fort Erie, at the most anxious moment\r\nof the Niagara campaign, Major-General Brown wrote to Secretary\r\nArmstrong,[323]--\r\n\r\n   “I very much doubt if a parallel can be found for the state\r\n   of things existing on this frontier. A gallant little army\r\n   struggling with the enemies of their country, and devoting their\r\n   lives for its honor and its safety, left by that country to\r\n   struggle alone, and that within sight and within hearing.”\r\n\r\nA month afterward Brown succeeded in obtaining a thousand volunteers,\r\nand by some quality of his own made them assault and carry works that\r\nold soldiers feared to touch. The feat was the most extraordinary that\r\nwas performed on either side in the remarkably varied experience of the\r\nwar; but it proved Brown’s personal energy rather than the merits of a\r\nmilitia system. At Washington the militia were thoroughly tested; their\r\nrout proved chiefly the incompetence of their general, but the system\r\nwas shown, before the battle, to be more defective than the army it\r\nproduced. At Baltimore the militia were again routed, and the town was\r\nsaved chiefly by the engineers and sailors. In Virginia, where more\r\nthan forty thousand militia were in the field, they protected nothing,\r\nand their service was more fatal to themselves than though they had\r\nfought severe battles. Nearly all the Virginia militia summoned for\r\nthe defence of Norfolk suffered from sickness, and the mortality\r\nwhen compared with that of the regular service was enormous; five\r\nmilitia-men sickened and died where one regular soldier suffered.[324]\r\nIn Tennessee and Georgia the experience was equally unfortunate; the\r\nGeorgia militia could do nothing with the Creeks, and Andrew Jackson\r\nhimself was helpless until he obtained one small regiment of regulars.\r\n\r\nBesides its military disadvantages the militia service was tainted with\r\nfraud. Habitually and notoriously in New England and New York, the\r\nmilitia-men when called out attended muster, served a few days in order\r\nto get their names on the pay-roll, and then went home. The United\r\nStates government wasted millions of dollars in pay and pensions for\r\nsuch men. Another source of waste was in the time required to place\r\nthem in the field. The government struggled to avoid a call of militia,\r\neven though risking great disasters by the neglect.\r\n\r\nThe worst of all evils lay still further in the background. The militia\r\nbegan by rendering a proper army impossible, and ended by making\r\ngovernment a form. The object of Massachusetts in praising the conduct\r\nof militia, and in maintaining its own at a high state of efficiency,\r\nwas notorious. The Federalists knew that the national government must\r\nsooner or later abandon the attempt to support an army. When that\r\ntime should come, the only resource of the government would lie in\r\nState armies, and Massachusetts was the best equipped State for that\r\nobject. Her militia, seventy thousand strong, well-armed, well-drilled,\r\nand as yet untouched by war, could dictate to the Union. Whenever\r\nMassachusetts should say the word, the war must stop; and Massachusetts\r\nmeant to say the word when the government fairly ceased to possess\r\neither money or arms.\r\n\r\nThat moment, in the belief of the Massachusetts Federalists, had come.\r\nTheir course in the summer and autumn of 1814 left no doubt of their\r\nintentions. No act of open rebellion could be more significant than\r\ntheir conduct when Sherbrooke’s expedition occupied Castine. Then\r\nat last Governor Strong consented to call out the militia, which he\r\nrefused to do two years before, because, he asserted, Castine and the\r\nother coast towns were sufficiently defended;[325] but the governor was\r\ncareful to avoid the suspicion that these troops were in the national\r\nservice. He acted independently of the national government in the\r\nterms of his general order of September, 1814,[326] placing his militia\r\nunder the command of a major-general of their own, and making only\r\na bare inquiry of the Secretary of War whether their expenses would\r\nbe reimbursed,[327]--an inquiry which Monroe at once answered in the\r\nnegative.[328] The force was a State army, and could not fail to cause\r\nthe President more anxiety than it was likely ever to cause the Prince\r\nRegent.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the governor of Connecticut withdrew from the command\r\nof Brigadier-General Cushing the brigade of State militia then in the\r\nnational service, and placed it under a major-general of State militia,\r\nwith injunctions to obey no orders except such as were issued by State\r\nauthority.[329] The evil of these measures was greatly aggravated\r\nby coinciding with the crisis which stopped the course of national\r\ngovernment. Connecticut withdrew her militia, August 24; Washington was\r\ncaptured the same day; the Philadelphia banks suspended payment August\r\n29; Castine was taken August 31; and Governor Strong called out the\r\nMassachusetts militia September 6. The government was prostrate, and\r\nNew England was practically independent when Sir George Prevost crossed\r\nthe frontier, September 3. So complete was the paralysis that Governor\r\nChittenden of Vermont, on receiving official notice[330] that the\r\nBritish army and navy were advancing on Lake Champlain, refused to call\r\nout the militia, because neither the Constitution nor the laws gave him\r\nauthority to order the militia out of the State.[331] He could only\r\nrecommend that individuals should volunteer to assist in the defence of\r\nPlattsburg. Chittenden’s conduct was the more suggestive because of his\r\nundoubted honesty and the absence of factious motive for his refusal.\r\n\r\nThe full meaning of Governor Strong’s course was avowed a few days\r\nafterward. Having called a special meeting of the State legislature\r\nfor October 5, he addressed to it a message narrating the steps he had\r\ntaken, and the refusal of the President to assume the expenses of the\r\nmilitia called into service for the defence of the State.\r\n\r\n   “The situation of this State is peculiarly dangerous and\r\n   perplexing,” said Governor Strong;[332] “we have been led by the\r\n   terms of the Constitution to rely on the government of the Union\r\n   to provide for our defence. We have resigned to that government\r\n   the revenues of the State with the expectation that this object\r\n   would not be neglected.... Let us then, relying on the support\r\n   and direction of Providence, unite in such measures for our\r\n   safety as the times demand and the principles of justice and the\r\n   law of self-preservation will justify.”\r\n\r\nThe sense which this invitation was intended to bear could be best\r\nunderstood by appreciating the temper of the body thus addressed and\r\nthe time when the appeal was made. The national government had for\r\npractical purposes ceased. The Boston “Centinel,” a newspaper of large\r\ncirculation, said to reach six thousand copies, announced September 10,\r\n1814, that the Union was already practically dissolved, and that the\r\npeople must rise in their majesty, protect themselves, and compel their\r\nunworthy servants to obey their will. Governor Strong knew that the\r\nlegislature was controlled by extreme partisans of the Pickering type,\r\nwho wished, to use his phrase, to “let the ship run aground.” Even\r\nJosiah Quincy, one of the most vehement Federalists, was aware that the\r\nmembers of the General Court stood in danger of doing too much rather\r\nthan too little.[333]\r\n\r\nStrong’s message of October 5 was echoed by Pickering from Washington,\r\nOctober 12, in a letter which closed with the exhortation to seize the\r\nnational revenues:--\r\n\r\n   “As, abandoned by the general government except for taxing us,\r\n   we must defend ourselves, so we ought to secure and hold fast\r\n   the revenues indispensable to maintain the force necessary for\r\n   our protection against the foreign enemy and the still greater\r\n   evil in prospect,--domestic tyranny.”[334]\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts legislature could not fail to understand Governor\r\nStrong’s message as an invitation to resume the powers with which the\r\nState had parted in adopting the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe legislature referred the message to a committee, which reported\r\nonly three days afterward through its chairman, Harrison Gray\r\nOtis:[335]--\r\n\r\n   “The state of the national Treasury as exhibited by the proper\r\n   officer requires an augmentation of existing taxes; and if in\r\n   addition to these the people of Massachusetts, deprived of their\r\n   commerce and harassed by a formidable enemy, are compelled to\r\n   provide for the indispensable duty of self-defence, it must soon\r\n   become impossible for them to sustain this burden. There remains\r\n   to them therefore no alternative but submission to the enemy, or\r\n   the control of their own resources to repel his aggressions. It\r\n   is impossible to hesitate in making the election. This people\r\n   are not ready for conquest or submission; but being ready and\r\n   determined to defend themselves, they have the greatest need of\r\n   those resources derivable from themselves which the national\r\n   government has hitherto thought proper to employ elsewhere.”\r\n\r\nThe report further showed that the United States Constitution had\r\nfailed to secure to New England the rights and benefits expected from\r\nit, and required immediate change. The prescribed mode of amendment was\r\ninsufficient:--\r\n\r\n   “When this deficiency becomes apparent, no reason can preclude\r\n   the right of the whole people who were parties to it to adopt\r\n   another.... But as a proposition for such a convention from a\r\n   single State would probably be unsuccessful, and our danger\r\n   admits not of delay, it is recommended by the committee that in\r\n   the first instance a conference should be invited between those\r\n   States the affinity of whose interests is closest.”\r\n\r\nThus, after ten years’ delay, the project of a New England Convention\r\nwas brought forward by State authority, through the process of war with\r\nEngland, which George Cabot from the first declared to be the only\r\nmeans of producing it.[336] As Otis’s committee presented the subject,\r\nthe conference was in the first place to devise some mode of common\r\ndefence; and, in the second, “to lay the foundation for a radical\r\nreform in the national compact by inviting to a future convention a\r\ndeputation from all the States in the Union.” The report closed by\r\noffering seven Resolutions, recommending the enlistment of a State\r\narmy of ten thousand men, a loan of a million dollars at six per cent,\r\nand the appointment of delegates “to meet and confer with delegates\r\nfrom the States of New England or any of them” on the defence of those\r\nStates and the redress of their grievances.\r\n\r\nThe Senate committee also made a strenuous argument against the\r\nPresident’s decision that State militia were in State service\r\nunless called for by a United States officer and placed under his\r\ndirection,[337] and recommended that the subject should be referred\r\nto the next session. To the proposition for a conference of the\r\nNew England States, and to Otis’s other Resolutions, the Senate\r\nand House assented, October 13, by large majorities, varying in\r\nnumbers, but amounting to two hundred and sixty against ninety in\r\nthe case of the proposed convention. The minority in both Houses\r\npresented protests, charging the majority with intending more than\r\nwas avowed. “The reasoning of the report,” said the Protest signed by\r\nseventy-six members of the House,[338] “is supported by the alarming\r\nassumption that the Constitution has failed in its objects, and the\r\npeople of Massachusetts are absolved from their allegiance, and at\r\nliberty to adopt another. In debate it has been reiterated that the\r\nConstitution is no longer to be respected, and that revolution is\r\nnot to be deprecated.” The House refused to receive the Protest, as\r\ndisrespectful. The minority withdrew from further share in these\r\nproceedings; and the majority then, October 19, chose twelve delegates\r\n“to meet and confer on the 15th December next with such as may be\r\nchosen by any or all of the other New England States upon our public\r\ngrievances and concerns.” The choice was marked by a conservative\r\nspirit not altogether pleasing to Timothy Pickering. George Cabot and\r\nHarrison Gray Otis stood at the head of the delegation.\r\n\r\nThe remonstrances and threats of the minority made the majority\r\ncautious, but did not check them. The legislature of Connecticut\r\nimmediately appointed seven delegates to meet those of Massachusetts at\r\nHartford, December 15, for the purpose of recommending “such measures\r\nfor the safety and welfare of these States as may consist with our\r\nobligations as members of the national Union.”[339] In this clause the\r\nlegislature intended to draw a distinction between obligations to the\r\nUnion and obligations to the Constitution. To the former the people\r\navowed no hostility; to the latter they thought the war had put an end.\r\nOn that point the committee’s report was clear.[340]\r\n\r\nBesides Massachusetts and Connecticut the legislature of Rhode Island,\r\nby a vote of thirty-nine to twenty-three, appointed, November 5, four\r\ndelegates to confer at Hartford upon the measures which might be in\r\ntheir power to adopt to restore their rights under the Constitution,\r\n“consistently with their obligations.”[341] These three States alone\r\nchose delegates. The governor and legislature of New Hampshire would\r\nprobably have joined them had not the Republican council stood in the\r\nway. The legislature of Vermont, including its Federalist minority,\r\nunanimously declined the invitation.\r\n\r\nImmediately after these steps were taken, the autumn elections\r\noccurred. Members of Congress were to be chosen, and the people were\r\nobliged to vote for or against the Hartford Convention as the issue\r\nexpressly avowed. President Madison might safely assume that no man\r\nvoted for Federalist Congressmen in November, 1814, unless he favored\r\nthe project of a New England Convention. The result was emphatic.\r\nMassachusetts chose eighteen Federalists and two Republicans; Vermont,\r\nNew Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Connecticut chose only Federalists.\r\nIn all, New England chose thirty-nine Federalist Congressmen and\r\ntwo Republicans[342] for the Fourteenth Congress. In the Thirteenth\r\nCongress, chosen in 1812, when the feeling against the war was supposed\r\nto be strongest, the Federalist members from New England numbered\r\nthirty, the Republicans eleven.[343]\r\n\r\nBeyond New England the autumn elections were less significant, but\r\nwere still unsatisfactory to the Administration. New Jersey returned\r\nto her true sympathies, and as far as her Congressmen expressed her\r\nopinions gave unanimous support to the war; but Pennsylvania, owing to\r\nlocal quarrels, elected five Federalist members; and Maryland elected\r\nfive Federalists and four Republicans. In spite of the great loss in\r\nFederalist members which had occurred in the spring elections in New\r\nYork, the Federalists numbered sixty-five in the Fourteenth Congress;\r\nin the Thirteenth they numbered sixty-eight. The Administration had\r\nhoped, and freely asserted, that a strong reaction in favor of the war\r\nhad followed the burning of Washington and the avowal of England’s\r\ndesigns against Maine and the Northwestern territory. The elections\r\nshowed no such reaction. The war was no more popular than before.\r\n\r\nThe public apathy was the more alarming because, whatever was the\r\ntrue object of the Hartford Convention, all Republicans believed it\r\nto be intended as a step to dissolve the Union, and they supported\r\nthe Administration chiefly because Madison represented the Union.\r\nFederalists might deceive themselves. Probably the men who voted for\r\nthe Hartford Convention saw its necessary consequences less clearly\r\nthan they were seen by the men who voted against it. The Republican\r\nvote represented the strength of Union sentiment more closely than\r\nthe disunion sentiment was represented by the Federalist vote. Yet\r\nthe States from Maryland to Maine chose a majority of Congressmen who\r\nwere not Republicans. The New England States, New York, New Jersey,\r\nPennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland returned much more than half\r\nthe members of Congress,--one hundred and eight in one hundred and\r\neighty-two; and of these fifty-seven were Federalists, while only\r\nfifty-one were Republicans. The unpopularity of the Administration was\r\nnot easily overestimated when Madison could win no more support than\r\nthis, at a time when the public believed a vote for Federalism to be a\r\nvote for disunion.\r\n\r\n   “I give you the most serious assurance,” wrote Randolph in an\r\n   open letter to James Lloyd, of Massachusetts,[344] remonstrating\r\n   against the Convention, “that nothing less than the shameful\r\n   conduct of the enemy and the complection of certain occurrences\r\n   to the eastward could have sustained Mr. Madison after the\r\n   disgraceful affair at Washington. The public indignation would\r\n   have overwhelmed in one common ruin himself and his hireling\r\n   newspapers.”\r\n\r\nRandolph’s political judgments were commonly mistaken, but in this\r\ninstance he proved himself to be at least partially right; for at the\r\nnext election, six months later, when the current had turned decidedly\r\nin Madison’s favor, Randolph after a sharp contest defeated Eppes and\r\nrecovered control of his district. Virginia could hardly have chosen a\r\nrepresentative less calculated to please Madison.\r\n\r\nThe President himself betrayed unusual signs of distress. Nothing in\r\nMadison’s character was more remarkable than the placidity with which\r\nhe commonly met anxieties that would have crushed a sensitive man; but\r\nthe shock of defeat at Bladensburg, the flight from Washington, and the\r\nanxieties that followed broke him down. William Wirt visited Washington\r\nOctober 14, before the action of the Massachusetts legislature was yet\r\ncompleted. After viewing the ruins of the White House, a “mournful\r\nmonument of American imbecility and improvidence,” he called upon\r\nthe President at Colonel Tayloe’s Octagon House, which Serurier had\r\noccupied, but which Madison took for his residence after his return.\r\n\r\n   “P---- and I called on the President,” wrote Wirt in a private\r\n   letter.[345] “He looks miserably shattered and woe-begone. In\r\n   short, he looked heart-broken. His mind is full of the New\r\n   England sedition. He introduced the subject and continued to\r\n   press it, painful as it obviously was to him. I denied the\r\n   probability, even the possibility, that the yeomanry of the\r\n   North could be induced to place themselves under the power and\r\n   protection of England, and diverted the conversation to another\r\n   topic; but he took the first opportunity to return to it, and\r\n   convinced me that his heart and mind were painfully full of the\r\n   subject.”\r\n\r\nNo misconduct of New England alone would have so unmanned a Virginia\r\nPresident. Madison’s worst troubles lay nearer home; Massachusetts\r\nmade only the last straw in his burden. Jefferson, with his usual\r\nkindliness, tried to console and encourage him; but Jefferson’s\r\nconsolations proved only the difficulty of finding words or arguments\r\nto warrant satisfaction with the past or hope for the future.\r\n\r\n   “In the late events at Washington,” wrote Jefferson, September\r\n   24,[346] “I have felt so much for you that I cannot withhold\r\n   the expression of my sympathies. For although every reasonable\r\n   man must ne sensible that all you can do is to order,--that\r\n   execution must depend on others, and failures be imputed to them\r\n   alone,--yet I know that when such failures happen they affect\r\n   even those who have done everything they could to prevent them.\r\n   Had General Washington himself been now at the head of our\r\n   affairs, the same event would probably have happened.”\r\n\r\nJefferson’s estimate of Washington’s abilities was lower than that\r\ncommonly accepted; and his rule that a President’s responsibility\r\nceased after giving an order, besides ignoring the President’s\r\nresponsibility for the selection of agents, seemed to destroy the\r\nfoundation of the public service. “I never doubted that the plans\r\nof the President were wise and sufficient,” wrote Jefferson to\r\nMonroe.[347] “Their failure we all impute, (1) to the insubordinate\r\ntemper of Armstrong, and (2) to the indecision of Winder.” The rule\r\nthat an administrator might select any agent, however incompetent,\r\nwithout incurring responsibility for the agent’s acts, was one which in\r\nprivate affairs Jefferson would hardly have accepted.\r\n\r\nYet Jefferson’s opinions probably expressed Republican sentiment in\r\nVirginia, and showed better than any other evidence the course of\r\nthought among Madison’s friends. In that respect his expressions\r\nretained permanent value. The Virginians were willing to throw off\r\nresponsibility for public disaster; and they naturally threw it\r\non New England, since New England challenged it. Writing to his\r\nfriend William Short, Jefferson spoke of the threatening attitude of\r\nMassachusetts:[348]--\r\n\r\n   “Some apprehend danger from the defection of Massachusetts. It\r\n   is a disagreeable circumstance, but not a dangerous one. If they\r\n   become neutral, we are sufficient for one enemy without them,\r\n   and in fact we get no aid from them now.”\r\n\r\nProbably most Virginians shared this belief, at least so far as\r\nconcerned the aid rendered by Massachusetts to the war. In truth,\r\nMassachusetts gave little aid, and made a profession of her wish to\r\ngive none at all; but the difficulty did not end there. Massachusetts\r\nand Virginia were States of the first class. The census of 1810\r\nallotted to Massachusetts, including Maine, a population of about seven\r\nhundred thousand; to Virginia, a white population of five hundred\r\nand fifty-one thousand, and a colored population of four hundred and\r\ntwenty-three thousand,--nine hundred and seventy-four thousand in\r\nall. In the ratio of representation Massachusetts counted for twenty,\r\nVirginia for twenty-three. The quota of Massachusetts in the direct tax\r\nwas $316,000; that of Virginia was $369,000. On the scale furnished\r\nby these data, Virginia should have contributed in support of the war\r\nabout one eighth or one seventh more men and money than were required\r\nfrom Massachusetts. The actual result was different.\r\n\r\nThe amount of money contributed by Massachusetts could not be compared\r\nwith that contributed by Virginia, partly because of the severe\r\nblockade which closed the Virginian ports. The net revenue from customs\r\nderived from Virginia in 1814 was $4,000; that from Massachusetts was\r\n$1,600,000.[349] Unlike the customs revenue, the receipts from internal\r\nrevenue were supposed to be reasonably equalized, so that each State\r\nshould contribute in due proportion. According to the official return,\r\ndated Nov. 24, 1815, the total internal duties which had then been paid\r\nto the collectors for the year 1814 in Massachusetts was $198,400; in\r\nVirginia it was $193,500. The total amount then paid to the Treasury\r\nwas $178,400 in Massachusetts, and $157,300 in Virginia.[350] The\r\ndirect tax was fixed by Congress and was assumed by the State in\r\nVirginia, but regularly assessed in Massachusetts. One paid $316,000;\r\nthe other, $369,000. The total revenue derived from Massachusetts was\r\ntherefore $2,114,400 in the year 1814; that from Virginia, $566,500. Of\r\nthe loans effected in the same year, Massachusetts took a small part\r\nconsidering her means,--hardly a million dollars. Virginia took still\r\nless,--only two hundred thousand.[351]\r\n\r\nIn money, Massachusetts contributed four times as much as Virginia to\r\nsupport the war, and her contributions were paid in Treasury notes or\r\npaper equivalent to coin,--not in the notes of banks worthless beyond\r\nthe State. In men, the estimate was affected by the inquiry whether the\r\nmilitia were to be considered as protecting the national government\r\nor the State. Owing to the presence of the British in the Chesapeake,\r\nVirginia kept a large force of militia on foot, some of which were\r\nin garrison at Norfolk, and a few were on the field of Bladensburg.\r\nMassachusetts also was obliged to call out a considerable force of\r\nmilitia to protect or garrison national posts.\r\n\r\nThe relative numbers of regular troops were also somewhat doubtful;\r\nbut the paymaster of the army reported Oct. 26, 1814, that he had\r\ndistributed in bounties during the year $237,400 for Massachusetts, and\r\n$160,962 for Virginia.[352] During the year, six regular regiments--the\r\nNinth, Twenty-first, Thirty-third, Thirty-fourth, Fortieth, and\r\nForty-fifth--recruited in Massachusetts. Three--the Twelfth, Twentieth,\r\nand Thirty-fifth--recruited in Virginia. Perhaps the military aid\r\nfurnished by the different sections of the seaboard could be better\r\nunderstood by following the familiar divisions. New England furnished\r\nthirteen regiments. New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania furnished\r\nfifteen. The Southern States, from Delaware to South Carolina\r\ninclusive, furnished ten. Of all the States in the Union New York alone\r\nsupplied more regular soldiers than Massachusetts, and Massachusetts\r\nsupplied as many as were furnished by Virginia and the two Carolinas\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nJudged by these standards, either Massachusetts had done more than\r\nher share, or Virginia had done less than hers. The tests were\r\nmaterial, and took no moral element in account; but in moral support\r\nthe relative failure of Massachusetts was not beyond dispute. Public\r\nopinion in New England was almost equally divided, and the pronounced\r\nopposition to the war was much greater in the Eastern States than in\r\nthe Southern; but in the serious work of fighting, New England claimed\r\na share of credit. In the little army at Niagara New York supplied\r\nthe Major-General, Virginia and Massachusetts the two brigadiers;\r\nbut Winfield Scott’s brigade was chiefly composed of New England\r\nmen; and when, nearly half a century afterward, Scott in his old\r\nage was obliged to choose between his allegiance to his State and\r\nallegiance to the Union, the memory of the New England troops who had\r\nwon for him his first renown had its influence in raising his mind\r\nabove the local sympathies which controlled other Virginia officers.\r\nWithout reflecting on Virginia courage or patriotism, the New England\r\nRepublicans were warranted in claiming that not the Virginia regiments,\r\nbut the Massachusetts Ninth, the Vermont Eleventh, the Massachusetts\r\nTwenty-first, and the Connecticut Twenty-fifth routed the Royal Scots\r\nat Chippawa, and bayoneted the British artillery-men at Lundy’s Lane,\r\nand stormed Drummond’s intrenchments at Fort Erie. They could add that\r\nwithout their sailors the war might have been less successful than it\r\nwas; and they would have been justified had they asked Jefferson to\r\nglance at his latest newspaper as he wrote that Massachusetts gave no\r\naid to the war, and read the despatch of Johnston Blakeley reporting\r\nthat the New England crew of the “Wasp” had sunk the “Avon” in the\r\nmiddle of a British fleet.[353] Virginians did not take kindly to the\r\nocean; and on land, owing to the accidents of war, no Virginia regiment\r\nwas offered a chance to win distinction.\r\n\r\nThese comparisons were of little weight to prove that New England was\r\neither better or worse than other parts of the Union, but they showed\r\nthat the difficulties that depressed Madison’s mind were not merely\r\nlocal. He might have disregarded the conduct of the State governments\r\nof Massachusetts and Connecticut had he enjoyed the full support of\r\nhis own great Republican States, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North\r\nCarolina. Except New York, Kentucky, Tennessee, and perhaps Ohio, no\r\nState gave to the war the full and earnest co-operation it needed.\r\nAgain and again, from the beginning of the troubles with England,\r\nMadison had acted on the conviction that at last the people were\r\naroused; but in every instance he had been disappointed. After the\r\nburning of Washington, he was more than ever convinced that the moment\r\nhad come when the entire people would rally in their self-respect;\r\nbut he was met by the Hartford Convention and the November elections.\r\nIf the people would not come to the aid of their government at such a\r\nmoment, Madison felt that nothing could move them. Peace was his last\r\nhope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGRESS was summoned to meet in extra session September 19,\r\nby a proclamation issued August 8, before the capture of Washington.\r\nOn the appointed day the members appeared, but found their building\r\nin ashes, and met like vagrants, without a shelter they could call\r\ntheir own. The President caused the only public office that had been\r\nspared, to be fitted for their use. Partly owing to the exertions of\r\nDr. Thornton, the head of the Bureau of Patents, partly owing to the\r\ntornado of August 25, the building used as Post and Patent Office was\r\nnot burned. There Congress was obliged to hold its sessions, in such\r\ndiscomfort as it had never before known.\r\n\r\nThe President sent his Annual Message September 20, which informed\r\nCongress that it had been specially summoned to supply “any inadequacy\r\nin the existing provision for the wants of the Treasury,” as well as\r\nto be ready for whatever result might be reached by the negotiation\r\nat Ghent. Two thirds of the Message related to the operations of war,\r\nand the President seemed rather disposed to suppress than to avow his\r\ndifficulties, but the little he said of them was heavy with anxiety.\r\nHe announced that July 1 five million dollars remained in the Treasury,\r\nand that “large sums” must be provided; but he did not add that the\r\nloan had failed, or that the banks and Treasury had suspended specie\r\npayments. He did not say that the regular army and the militia system\r\nwere inadequate to national defence; but he declared “the necessity of\r\nimmediate measures for filling the ranks of the regular army,” and of\r\ngiving “the requisite energy and efficiency” to the militia:--\r\n\r\n   “From this view of the national affairs Congress will be urged\r\n   to take up, without delay, as well the subject of pecuniary\r\n   supplies as that of military force, and on a scale commensurate\r\n   with the extent and the character which the war has assumed. It\r\n   is not to be disguised that the situation of our country calls\r\n   for its greatest efforts.... From such an adversary, hostility\r\n   in its greatest force and in its worst forms may be looked for.”\r\n\r\nThe President threw on the Secretaries of the Treasury and of War the\r\nungrateful task of announcing the details of their need. Secretary\r\nCampbell was first to address Congress, and the tone of his report on\r\nthe state of the finances received emphasis from the resignation which\r\nhe sent at the same time to the President. Campbell’s annual report of\r\nSeptember 23 was an admission of incompetence. He had paid, he said,\r\nnearly twenty millions from the Treasury between January and July;\r\ntwenty-seven millions more were payable between July and the following\r\nJanuary. For the year 1815 the Treasury would require at least as\r\nmuch as for 1814. Congress must therefore speedily provide at least\r\nseventy-four millions for the service between July 1, 1814, and Dec.\r\n31, 1815. He ventured to suggest no means of obtaining this sum, or any\r\namount approaching it.\r\n\r\nJuly 1 the Treasury contained $4,722,000. From its various sources of\r\nrevenue it could expect $4,840,000 during the remainder of the year;\r\nfrom loans already contracted, $4,320,000. In all, $13,822,000 might be\r\nconsidered as in hand, which was one half the sum immediately required.\r\nFor the year 1815 the revenue in all its branches might produce\r\n$8,200,000, leaving $39,000,000 to be provided. Twenty-two millions\r\nwere the extent of Campbell’s resources, but fifty-two million dollars\r\nmore must be raised merely to carry on the government as it had been\r\nadministered in the past year.\r\n\r\nThe plan of finance adopted by Gallatin at the outset of the war\r\nassumed that all deficits could be covered by loans.\r\n\r\n   “The experience of the present year,” said Campbell, “furnishes\r\n   ground to doubt whether this be practicable, at least in the\r\n   shape in which loans have hitherto been attempted. Nor is it\r\n   even certain that the establishing and pledging of revenues\r\n   adequate to the punctual payment of the interest and eventual\r\n   reimbursement of the principal of the sums which will be\r\n   required for the year 1815, would enable the Treasury to obtain\r\n   them through the medium of loans effected in the ordinary way.”\r\n\r\nLoans being impracticable, Campbell discussed the possibility of using\r\nTreasury notes. Eight millions were already in issue, and of these\r\nmore than four millions would fall due before December 31. Campbell\r\nconsidered that six millions in Treasury notes was about as large\r\na sum as could easily be circulated, but by issuing notes of small\r\ndenominations he hoped to raise the amount to ten millions.\r\n\r\nFrom all sources Campbell hoped to obtain about twenty-four million\r\ndollars of the seventy-four millions required. For the remaining\r\nfifty millions he had no suggestion to offer. The means for new and\r\nextraordinary exertions, he said, “ought to be provided.” He declared\r\nthat the resources of the nation were ample,--which was true, but was\r\nalso the most discouraging symptom of the time; for if the people,\r\nwith ample resources, as he asserted, refused to come to the support\r\nof their own government on any terms, their decision must be accepted\r\nas final. Besides throwing upon Congress all these difficulties,\r\nwithout a suggestion of his own, Campbell added that Congress would be\r\nrequired to exert its powers to remedy the evils of the currency and\r\nthe suspension of specie payments.\r\n\r\nCongress on hearing this financial statement regarded the situation\r\nas desperate. “Tell Dr. Madison,” Senator Lacock was reported[354]\r\nto have said to the President’s private secretary, “that we are now\r\nwilling to submit to his Philadelphia lawyer for head of the Treasury.\r\nThe public patient is so very sick that we must swallow anything,\r\nhowever nauseous.” Dallas was nominated October 5, and confirmed the\r\nnext day without opposition, as Secretary of the Treasury. No stronger\r\nproof could have been given of the helplessness of Congress, for Dallas\r\nwas a man who under no other circumstances could have obtained a ray of\r\npopular favor.\r\n\r\nDallas’s character was high, his abilities undoubted, his experience\r\nlarge; but for ten years he had been one of the least popular men\r\nin Pennsylvania, the target of newspaper abuse and the champion of\r\npolitical independence. The people reasonably required that their\r\nleaders should more or less resemble some popular type, and if the\r\nresult was monotonous the fault was in the society, not in its politics\r\nor its politicians; but Dallas was like no ordinary type in any people.\r\nHis tone of intellectual and social superiority, his powdered hair,\r\nold-fashioned dress and refined manners, his free habits of expense,\r\nand the insubordination even more than the vivacity of his temper\r\nirritated the prejudices of his party.[355] He had little respect\r\nfor Presidents, and none for Congress. For Jefferson and Virginia\r\ndoctrines he felt distrust, which was returned. Earnest in temper and\r\nemphatic in tone, even to the point of tears and tropical excitability,\r\nDallas came to Washington as though to lead a forlorn hope,--caring\r\nlittle for parties and less for ambition, but bent upon restoring to\r\nthe government the powers that his friend Gallatin, too easily as he\r\nthought, had allowed to slip from its grasp.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of the Treasury when Dallas took charge of it were\r\nnot easily exaggerated. His own description,[356] given some six weeks\r\nafterward, made no disguise of them. “The Treasury,” he said, “was\r\nsuffering under every kind of embarrassment. The demands upon it were\r\ngreat in amount, while the means to satisfy them were comparatively\r\nsmall, precarious in collection, and difficult in their application....\r\nThe means consisted, first, of the fragment of an authority to borrow\r\nmoney when nobody was disposed to lend, and to issue Treasury notes\r\nwhich none but necessitous creditors or contractors in distress ...\r\nseemed willing to accept;” second, of bank-credits, chiefly in the\r\nSouth and West, rendered largely useless by the suspension of specie\r\npayments; third, of the current receipts of taxes, also useless because\r\npaid chiefly in Treasury notes. The Treasury was bankrupt. The formal\r\nstoppage of payments in interest on the debt was announced, November\r\n9, by an official letter from the secretary, notifying holders of\r\ngovernment securities in Boston that the Treasury could not meet its\r\nobligations, and that “the government was unable to avert or to control\r\nthis course of events.”[357] After that date the Treasury made no\r\nfurther pretence of solvency.\r\n\r\nFrom this situation the government could be rescued only by a great\r\neffort; and obviously the currency must be first restored, for\r\nuntil some system of exchange could be established, every increase\r\nof taxation would merely increase unavailable bank deposits. Fifty\r\nmillions of Southern bank-notes, locked in the vaults of Southern\r\nbanks, would not pay the over-due interest on government bonds at\r\nBoston.\r\n\r\nTo this subject every one turned, but the schemes that seemed to have\r\na chance of adoption were only two. The first came from President\r\nJefferson, and was strongly pressed by the South. As Jefferson\r\nexplained it, the plan seemed as simple as his plans were apt to\r\nbe; he proposed to issue twenty millions in promissory notes every\r\nyear as long as might be necessary. “Our experience,” he told the\r\nPresident,[358] “has proved it [a paper currency] may be run up to two\r\nor three hundred millions without more than doubling what would be the\r\nprices of things under a sufficient medium, or say a metallic one.” His\r\nplan included an increase of taxation by two million dollars every year\r\nto redeem the same amount of Treasury issues.\r\n\r\nObviously the insuperable obstacle to this plan was the paper money\r\nof the State banks, which already stood at discounts varying from ten\r\nto fifty per cent in specie, and in any large quantity could not be\r\ndiscounted at all. Until private paper should be abolished, public or\r\ngovernment paper could not be brought into common use. Jefferson’s\r\nviews on this, as on the whole subject, were interesting.\r\n\r\n   “The banks have discontinued themselves,” he explained.[359]\r\n   “We are now without any medium; and necessity, as well as\r\n   patriotism and confidence, will make us all eager to receive\r\n   Treasury notes if founded on specific taxes. Congress may now\r\n   borrow of the public, and without interest, all the money they\r\n   may want, to the amount of a competent circulation, by merely\r\n   issuing their own promissory notes of proper denominations for\r\n   the larger purposes of circulation, but not for the small. Leave\r\n   that door open for the entrance of metallic money.... The State\r\n   legislatures should be immediately urged to relinquish the right\r\n   of establishing banks of discount. Most of them will comply on\r\n   patriotic principles, under the convictions of the moment; and\r\n   the non-complying may be crowded into concurrence by legitimate\r\n   devices.”\r\n\r\nInstead of “banks of discount,” Jefferson probably meant to say banks\r\nof issue, although the Virginia school was hostile to all banks, and\r\npossibly he wished to destroy the whole system. If the scheme were\r\nadopted, twenty million dollars in paper money would not supply the\r\nwants of the Treasury, which required at least fifty millions within a\r\nyear. The resource was limited, even if the States could be compelled\r\nto stop the issue of private notes,--which was extremely doubtful in\r\nthe temper of Massachusetts and with the leanings of Chief-Justice\r\nMarshall. Jefferson did not touch upon legal tender; but the assumption\r\nof power implied in the issue of paper money seemed to require that\r\nthe government should exercise the right of obliging its creditors to\r\naccept it. The actual interest-bearing Treasury notes stood then at\r\na discount of about twenty per cent. The proposed paper money could\r\nhardly circulate at a better rate, and coin was not to be obtained.\r\nUnder such conditions the notes must be a forced currency if they were\r\nto circulate at all.\r\n\r\nThe scheme was reported to the House by the Committee of Ways and Means\r\nthrough its chairman, John W. Eppes, Jefferson’s son-in-law.[360] For\r\nthe report Eppes was alone responsible, and the plan in his hands\r\nvaried in some points from that of Jefferson. Starting from the\r\nadmitted premise that loans were not to be obtained, and that money\r\ncould not be transferred from one point to another in any existing\r\nmedium at the disposition of government, Eppes proposed to issue\r\nTreasury notes “in sums sufficiently small for the ordinary purposes\r\nof society,” which were not to be made payable on demand in coin, but\r\nmight at any time be exchanged for eight per cent bonds, and were to\r\nbe received “in all payments for public lands and taxes.” Nothing was\r\nsaid of legal tender, or of driving bank-notes from circulation; but\r\nEppes proposed to double the taxes at one stroke.\r\n\r\nEppes’s scheme lost the advantages of Jefferson’s without gaining any\r\nof its own. It abandoned the hope of abolishing bank paper; and in want\r\nof such a restraint on private issues, the proposed government paper\r\nwould merely add one more element of confusion to the chaos already\r\nexisting. Eppes further altered Jefferson’s plan by adding some ten\r\nmillions instead of two millions to the burden of taxation; but even\r\nJefferson protested that this part of the scheme was impracticable.\r\n\r\n   “This is a dashing proposition,” he wrote to Monroe;[361] “but\r\n   if Congress pass it, I shall consider it sufficient evidence\r\n   that their constituents generally can pay the tax. No man has\r\n   greater confidence than I have in the spirit of the people to\r\n   a rational extent. Whatever they can, they will. But without\r\n   either market or medium, I know not how it is to be done. All\r\n   markets abroad and all at home are shut to us, so that we have\r\n   been feeding our horses on wheat. Before the day of collection,\r\n   bank-notes will be but as oak-leaves; and of specie there is not\r\n   within all the United States one half of the proposed amount of\r\n   the taxes.”\r\n\r\nThis was the situation of the Virginia scheme when Dallas took the\r\nmatter in hand. Immediately after entering into office, Dallas wrote to\r\nEppes an official letter, dated October 17, expressing views wholly at\r\nvariance with the Virginia plan.\r\n\r\n   “Under favorable circumstances and to a limited extent,” he\r\n   said,[362] “an emission of Treasury notes would probably afford\r\n   relief; but Treasury notes are an expensive and precarious\r\n   substitute either for coin or for bank-notes, charged as they\r\n   are with a growing interest, productive of no countervailing\r\n   profit or emolument, and exposed to every breath of popular\r\n   prejudice or alarm. The establishment of a national institution\r\n   operating upon credit combined with capital, and regulated by\r\n   prudence and good faith, is after all the only efficient remedy\r\n   for the disordered condition of our circulating medium. While\r\n   accomplishing that object, too, there will be found under the\r\n   auspices of such an institution a safe depository for the public\r\n   treasure and a constant auxiliary to the public credit. But\r\n   whether the issues of a paper currency proceed from the national\r\n   Treasury or from a national Bank, the acceptance of the paper in\r\n   a course of payments and receipts must be forever optional with\r\n   the citizens. The extremity of that day cannot be anticipated\r\n   when any honest and enlightened statesman will again venture\r\n   upon the desperate expedient of a tender-law.”\r\n\r\nWithout a tender-law the Virginia scheme would hardly answer the\r\npurposes required, since the government must restrain the issue of\r\npaper within a limit too narrow for usefulness. Dallas did not press\r\nthis point, but developed his own scheme, which required, like that of\r\nEppes, a duplication of taxes to produce twenty-one million dollars,\r\nand the creation of a national Bank with a capital of fifty million\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nEither Eppes’s or Dallas’s plan might answer the immediate object\r\nof providing a currency, and both required the exercise of implied\r\npowers by Congress. Apparently Congress had only to choose, but in\r\ntruth choice was most difficult. The House readily adopted Dallas’s\r\nrecommendation in principle, and voted, October 24, by sixty-six to\r\nforty, that it was expedient to establish a national Bank; but the\r\nproblem of establishing a specie-paying bank without specie passed\r\nits powers. Dallas abandoned the attempt at the outset. He proposed a\r\nbank of fifty millions capital, of which forty-four millions might be\r\nsubscribed in government bonds and Treasury notes, and six millions in\r\ncoin. The bank was at once to lend to government thirty millions,--of\r\ncourse in bank-notes,--and no one denied that an immediate suspension\r\nof specie payments must follow such an issue. To any bank, strong or\r\nweak, the old Virginia influence represented by Eppes was hostile; and\r\nto a bank insolvent from the start the Federalists also were opposed.\r\n\r\nWhen the bill, reported November 7, was printed, it was found to\r\ncontain a provision authorizing the suspension of specie payments at\r\nthe President’s discretion. The discussion began November 14, and\r\nevery successive day revealed objections and increased the opposition.\r\nCalhoun complicated the subject still further by bringing forward,\r\nNovember 16, a plan of his own, requiring the capital to consist “one\r\ntenth in specie, and the remainder in specie or in Treasury notes to\r\nbe hereafter issued,” and taking away all government control. Ingham\r\nof Pennsylvania, representing Dallas, combated Calhoun with force, but\r\ncould not make his own measure agreeable to the House. His phrase in\r\nregard to the suspension of specie payments was significant. Congress,\r\nhe said, would be to blame for “frantic enthusiasm” if it did not\r\nprovide for the case. “It may happen, and probably will happen, that\r\ntheir specie payments cannot be continued, and what will then be\r\nthe situation of the bank? Failing to fulfil the purposes designed,\r\nits credit is blighted, its operations are stopped, and its charter\r\nviolated; and if this should take place before your Treasury notes are\r\nsold, the government will scarce obtain a moment’s relief.” That the\r\nnew bank could not pay specie was obvious. The Bank of England itself\r\ncould not pay specie, and had not attempted to do so for nearly twenty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe House in committee adopted Calhoun’s amendment by a majority of\r\nabout sixty, in spite of Ingham’s opposition; and thus substituted for\r\nDallas’s scheme a large private bank, over which the government was\r\nto exercise no control, with a capital of fifty millions, nine tenths\r\nof which were to be Treasury notes. The House then discovered so many\r\nunforeseen difficulties, that November 25 it recommitted the bill to a\r\nselect committee, of which Lowndes, Calhoun, Ingham, Forsyth, and two\r\nFederalists were members.\r\n\r\nDallas was obliged openly to enter the lists against Calhoun, and\r\nwrote to the committee a letter, dated November 27,[363] sounding like\r\na defiance: “The dividend on the funded debt has not been punctually\r\npaid; a large amount of Treasury notes has already been dishonored;\r\nand the hope of preventing further injury and reproach in transacting\r\nbusiness with the Treasury is too visionary to afford a moment’s\r\nconsolation.” Calhoun’s scheme, he plainly intimated, was impracticable\r\nand mischievous.\r\n\r\nThe next day, November 28, Lowndes brought back Calhoun’s bill to\r\nthe House, together with Dallas’s letter, and told the House that\r\nthe committee could come to no agreement. Upon this admission of\r\nhelplessness, Hanson addressed the House in a speech which seemed to\r\ncarry Federalist exultation to the extremest point. Protesting his\r\nanxiety to defend the country, Hanson uttered a cry of triumph over the\r\ndestruction of the government:--\r\n\r\n   “Not only had government bills been dishonored and the interest\r\n   of the public debt remained unpaid, but ... so completely\r\n   empty was the Treasury and destitute of credit, that funds\r\n   could not be obtained to defray the current ordinary expenses\r\n   of the different Departments. Disgraceful, humiliating as the\r\n   fact was, it ought not to be concealed from the nation, and he\r\n   felt it his duty to state to the House that the Department\r\n   of State was so bare of money as to be unable to pay even\r\n   its stationery bill. The government was subsisting upon the\r\n   drainings of unchartered banks in the District, which felt\r\n   themselves compelled to contribute their means lest the rod\r\n   _in terrorem_ which was held over them should be applied,\r\n   and an Act of incorporation refused.”\r\n\r\nNo one contradicted or answered Hanson. The House wavered in incapacity\r\nthat suggested dissolution. At last Richard M. Johnson, in order to\r\nforce a decision right or wrong, moved the previous question and\r\nbrought the House to a vote. Then the majority turned against Calhoun,\r\nas they had before turned against Dallas, and rejected the bill by a\r\nvote of one hundred and four to forty-nine.\r\n\r\nThe Southern preference for government paper currency lay at the bottom\r\nof Calhoun’s scheme as of Jefferson’s, and seemed to Dallas to combine\r\nignorance with dishonesty. Treasury notes bearing interest could not\r\nbe made to serve as a currency, and were useless as a foundation for\r\ngovernment paper. “What use is there,” asked Ingersoll,[364] “in such\r\na mass of banking machinery to give circulation to some millions of\r\nTreasury notes? Why not issue them at once without this unwieldy, this\r\nunnecessary medium?” Yet when Bolling Hall of Georgia, in pursuance of\r\nMacon’s aphorism that “paper money never was beat,” moved, November 12,\r\nResolutions authorizing the issue of Treasury notes as legal tender,\r\nthe House refused to consider it by a vote of ninety-five to forty-two.\r\nEppes did not vote; Calhoun voted against it, and of the twenty-five\r\nSouthern members who supported it Macon and Stanford were the most\r\nprominent.\r\n\r\nNothing could be plainer than that the House must ultimately come to\r\ninconvertible government paper, whether issued by the Treasury or by\r\na Bank. Dallas, Eppes, and Calhoun were all agreed on that point, if\r\non no other; but after Congress had sat two months and a half, the\r\nHouse was no nearer a decision than when it met. The Federalists,\r\nvoting at one time with Calhoun, at another with Dallas, were able to\r\nparalyze action. Eppes wrote to Dallas, December 2, inviting further\r\ninformation; and Dallas wrote back the same day, recounting the needs\r\nof the Treasury for the current month, merely on account of the\r\nnational debt. Dallas reported that $5,726,000 in Treasury notes and\r\ndividends were due, or would fall due by January 1; and that including\r\nunavailable bank-credits, and subject to possible contingencies,\r\nthe Treasury might contain resources to meet these demands to the\r\namount of $3,972,000.[365] Eppes could do no more for immediate\r\nrelief than report a bill for the issue of some ten millions more of\r\ninterest-bearing Treasury notes, which was passed without debate and\r\nbecame law, December 26, without improving the situation.\r\n\r\nThe House also passed the heavy tax-bills without much opposition\r\nexcept from Federalists who wished to stop military operations on the\r\npart of the government. Between thirty and forty members, or about one\r\nhalf of the Federalists, carried their opposition to that point. The\r\nbill raising the direct tax to six million dollars passed the House,\r\nDecember 22, by a vote of one hundred and six to fifty-three, and\r\npassed the Senate, January 5, 1815, by twenty-three to seven. Dallas\r\nand Eppes hoped to raise about twenty million dollars through the new\r\ntaxation, or twice what had been previously attempted. Jefferson held\r\nthat these taxes could not be paid, and expressed his opinion without\r\nreserve.\r\n\r\n   “If anything could revolt our citizens against the war,” wrote\r\n   Jefferson, November 28,[366] “it would be the extravagance with\r\n   which they are about to be taxed.... The taxes proposed cannot\r\n   be paid. How can a people who cannot get fifty cents a bushel\r\n   for their wheat, while they pay twelve dollars a bushel for\r\n   their salt, pay five times the amount of taxes they ever paid\r\n   before? Yet this will be the case in all the States south of the\r\n   Potomac.”\r\n\r\nIf any conclusion was intended to be drawn from the official\r\nreturn[367] sent to Congress, October 13, of internal taxes received\r\nto that date in each State, the evil predicted by Jefferson seemed\r\nalready to exist. In Massachusetts, of taxes to the amount of\r\n$200,000, accrued for the first two quarters of the year, $170,000 had\r\nbeen received before October 10. In New York $393,000 had accrued, and\r\n$303,000 had been received; thus New York was nearly one fourth in\r\narrears. Pennsylvania was worse; of $470,000 accrued the government\r\nhad received $280,000,--leaving two fifths in arrears. Virginia was\r\nin somewhat worse condition than Pennsylvania; of $247,000 accrued\r\n$136,000 had been paid,--leaving four ninths in arrears.\r\n\r\nYet Pennsylvania and Virginia paid taxes in their own depreciated bank\r\npaper, while New York and New England paid chiefly in Treasury notes.\r\nThe new taxes were still to be paid in the same medium, although the\r\nlaws gave no express authority for it. In the next Congress, when the\r\nsubject was discussed, Wright of Maryland said:[368] “When Congress\r\npassed the revenue laws and imposed the six million and three million\r\nland tax, did they contemplate the payment of specie? No! they knew\r\nthe people had it not, and of course could not pay it.... Does any man\r\ndoubt that Congress intended these taxes being paid in bank paper? Nay,\r\nhas not the Secretary of the Treasury ... sealed this construction\r\nof the law by taking the bank paper in discharge for these taxes?”\r\nThat the bank paper was worth less than Treasury notes was shown\r\nby the Southern States paying their taxes in such paper, when they\r\nmight equally well have paid them in Treasury notes except for the\r\ndifference in value.\r\n\r\nThe medium of depreciated and depreciating bank paper in which the\r\ntaxes were to be paid, secured the States outside of New England from\r\nintolerable pressure by giving the means of indefinite depreciation;\r\nbut to the government such a resource meant merely a larger variety\r\nof bank-credits, which were of no certain value even in the towns\r\nwhere the banks existed, and were of no value at all elsewhere. The\r\nburden of taxation would be thrown chiefly on New England; and if the\r\nHartford Convention did nothing else, it was sure to take measures\r\nfor sequestering the proceeds of taxation in New England for military\r\npurposes. The hope of restoring the finances by taxation was faint.\r\nUntil the currency could be established and exchanges made secure, the\r\ngovernment was helpless.\r\n\r\nThe House having broken down November 28, the Senate next took the\r\nmatter in hand. Rufus King reported, December 2, a bill to incorporate\r\na bank, which was in effect the bill recommended by Dallas. After a\r\nweek’s consideration the Senate passed the bill, December 9, by the\r\nvote of seventeen to fourteen,--King and the Federalists, with four\r\nRepublican senators, voting against it. The House referred it to the\r\nCommittee of Ways and Means, which reported it, December 14, with\r\namendments. The debate began December 23, and was cut short December 27\r\nby C. J. Ingersoll, who by the close vote of seventy-two to seventy\r\nobliged the House to call for the previous question, and order the bill\r\nto its third reading. This energy was followed by a reaction; the bill\r\nwas recommitted for amendment, again reported, and vehemently attacked.\r\n\r\nNever had the House shown itself more feeble. The Federalists took the\r\nlead in debate; and January 2 Daniel Webster, in a speech that placed\r\nhim at the head of the orators of the time, dictated the action of\r\nCongress:--\r\n\r\n   “What sort of an institution, sir, is this? It looks less like a\r\n   bank than like a department of government. It will be properly\r\n   the paper-money department. Its capital is government debts;\r\n   the amount of issues will depend on government necessities;\r\n   government in effect absolves itself from its own debts to the\r\n   bank, and by way of compensation absolves the bank from its own\r\n   contracts with others. This is indeed a wonderful scheme of\r\n   finance. The government is to grow rich because it is to borrow\r\n   without the obligation of repaying, and is to borrow of a bank\r\n   which issues paper without the liability to redeem it.... They\r\n   provide for an unlimited issue of paper in an entire exemption\r\n   from payment. They found their bank in the first place on the\r\n   discredit of government, and then hope to enrich government out\r\n   of the insolvency of the bank.”\r\n\r\nWebster was a master of antithesis, and the proposed bank was in effect\r\nwhat he described; but had he been a member of the British Parliament\r\nhe might have made the same objections, with little alteration, to\r\nthe Bank of England. The Hartford Convention was in session while he\r\nspoke. Every word of his speech was a shock to the government and the\r\nUnion, for his only suggestion was equivalent to doing nothing. He\r\nmoved to instruct the committee to report a bill creating a bank with\r\nthirty millions of capital, composed one fourth of specie and three\r\nfourths of government securities; without power to suspend specie\r\npayments, and without obligation to lend three fifths of its capital\r\nto the government. To such a bank he would give his support, “not as a\r\nmeasure of temporary policy, or an expedient to find means of relief\r\nfrom the present poverty of the Treasury,” but as an institution most\r\nuseful in times of peace.\r\n\r\nThe House came to a vote the same day, and divided eighty-one to\r\neighty. Then the Speaker, Langdon Cheves, rose, and after denouncing\r\nthe proposed bank as “a dangerous, unexampled, and he might almost say\r\na desperate resort,” gave his casting vote against the bill.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the House struck this blow at Dallas than it shrank\r\nback. The next day, amid complaints and objections, it reconsidered\r\nits matured decision by the sudden majority of one hundred and seven\r\nto fifty-four. Once more the bill was recommitted, and once more\r\nreported, January 6, in the form that Webster proposed. Weary of their\r\nown instability, the majority hastened to vote. Most of the Federalists\r\nsupported the bill; but Grosvenor of New York, one of the ablest,\r\nfrankly said what every one felt, that the proposed institution could\r\nnot be a specie bank, or get a million of its notes into circulation.\r\n“The government relying on it would be disappointed, and ruin soon\r\nstare them in the face.” With this understanding the House passed the\r\nbill, January 7, by a vote of one hundred and twenty to thirty-eight;\r\nand the Senate, after a struggle with the House, accepted it, January\r\n20, by a vote of twenty to fourteen.\r\n\r\nDallas was not a man to be easily daunted even in so desperate a\r\nsituation. After ten days deliberation, the President sent to Congress\r\na veto message.\r\n\r\n   “The most the bank could effect,” said Madison, “and the most it\r\n   could be expected to aim at, would be to keep the institution\r\n   alive by limited and local transactions ... until a change from\r\n   war to peace should enable it, by a flow of specie into its\r\n   vaults and a removal of the external demand for it, to derive\r\n   its contemplated emoluments from a safe and full extension of\r\n   its operations.”\r\n\r\n“I hope this will satisfy our friends,” wrote Webster to his\r\nbrother,[369] “that it was not a bank likely to favor the\r\nAdministration.” Either with or without such a bank, the Administration\r\nwas equally helpless. The veto left the Treasury, February 1, without\r\na resource in prospect. The unsatisfied demands reached nearly twenty\r\nmillions. The cash balance, chiefly in bank-credits, was little more\r\nthan six millions. A further deficit of forty millions remained\r\nto be provided above the estimated revenue of 1815. United States\r\nsix-per-cents commanded only a nominal price, between fifty and sixty\r\ncents on the dollar,[370] and were quoted in Boston at a discount of\r\nforty cents.[371] Treasury notes being in demand for taxes, were worth\r\nabout seventy-five cents in the dollar. Dallas had no serious hope of\r\ncarrying on the government. In a letter to the Committee of Ways and\r\nMeans, dated January 17, he could only propose to add six millions more\r\nto the taxes, issue fifteen millions in Treasury notes, and borrow\r\ntwenty-five millions on any terms that could be obtained. In making\r\nthese recommendations he avowed in grave words his want of confidence\r\nin their result:[372]--\r\n\r\n   “In making the present communication I feel, sir, that I have\r\n   performed my duty to the Legislature and to the country; but\r\n   when I perceive that more than forty millions of dollars must be\r\n   raised for the service of the year 1815, by an appeal to public\r\n   credit through the medium of the Treasury notes and loans, I am\r\n   not without sensations of extreme solicitude.”\r\n\r\nYoung George Ticknor of Boston happened to be in the gallery of the\r\nHouse of Representatives when Eppes read this letter, January 21, and\r\nthe next day he wrote,[373]--\r\n\r\n   “The last remarkable event in the history of this remarkable\r\n   Congress is Dallas’s report. You can imagine nothing like the\r\n   dismay with which it has filled the Democratic party. All his\r\n   former communications were but emollients and palliations\r\n   compared with this final disclosure of the bankruptcy of the\r\n   nation. Mr. Eppes as Chancellor of the Exchequer, or Chairman\r\n   of the Committee of Ways and Means, read it in his place\r\n   yesterday, and when he had finished, threw it upon the table\r\n   with expressive violence, and turning round to Mr. Gaston, asked\r\n   him with a bitter levity between jest and earnest,--\r\n\r\n   “‘Well, sir! will your party take the government if we will give\r\n   it up to them?’\r\n\r\n   “‘No, sir!’ said Gaston; ... ‘No, sir! Not unless you will give\r\n   it to us as we gave it to you!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHILE Dallas struggled with Congress to obtain the means of\r\nestablishing a currency in order to pay the army, Monroe carried on a\r\nsimilar struggle in order to obtain an army to pay. On this point, as\r\non the financial issue, Virginian ideas did not accord with the wishes\r\nof Government. The prejudice against a regular army was stimulated\r\nby the evident impossibility of raising or supporting it. Once more\r\nJefferson expressed the common feeling of his Virginia neighbors.[374]\r\n\r\n   “We must prepare for interminable war,” he wrote to Monroe,\r\n   October 16. “To this end we should put our house in order by\r\n   providing men and money to an indefinite extent. The former may\r\n   be done by classing our militia, and assigning each class to the\r\n   description of duties for which it is fit. It is nonsense to\r\n   talk of regulars. They are not to be had among a people so easy\r\n   and happy at home as ours. We might as well rely on calling down\r\n   an army of angels from heaven.”\r\n\r\nAs Jefferson lost the habits of power and became once more a Virginia\r\nplanter, he reverted to the opinions and prejudices of his earlier life\r\nand of the society in which he lived. As Monroe grew accustomed to the\r\nexercise and the necessities of power, he threw aside Virginian ideas\r\nand accepted the responsibilities of government. On the same day when\r\nJefferson wrote to Monroe that it was nonsense to talk of regulars,\r\nMonroe wrote to Congress that it was nonsense to talk of militia. The\r\ndivergence between Monroe and Jefferson was even greater than between\r\nDallas and Eppes.\r\n\r\n   “It may be stated with confidence,” wrote Monroe to\r\n   Congress,[375] “that at least three times the force in militia\r\n   has been employed at our principal cities, along the coast and\r\n   on the frontier, in marching to and returning thence, that would\r\n   have been necessary in regular troops; and that the expense\r\n   attending it has been more than proportionately augmented from\r\n   the difficulty if not the impossibility of preserving the same\r\n   degree of system in the militia as in the regular service.”\r\n\r\nIn Monroe’s opinion a regular force was an object “of the highest\r\nimportance.” He told the Senate committee that the army, which was only\r\nthirty-four thousand strong on the first of October, should be raised\r\nto its legal limit of sixty-two thousand, and that another permanent\r\narmy of forty thousand men should be raised for strictly defensive\r\nservice. In the face of Jefferson’s warning that he might as well call\r\ndown an army of angels from heaven, Monroe called for one hundred\r\nthousand regular troops, when no exertions had hitherto availed to\r\nkeep thirty thousand effectives on the rolls.\r\n\r\nThe mere expression of such a demand carried with it the train of\r\nconsequences which the people chiefly dreaded. One hundred thousand\r\ntroops could be raised only by draft. Monroe affirmed the power as well\r\nas the need of drafting. “Congress have a right by the Constitution,”\r\nhe said, “to raise regular armies, and no restraint is imposed on the\r\nexercise of it.... It would be absurd to suppose that Congress could\r\nnot carry this power into effect otherwise than by accepting the\r\nvoluntary service of individuals.” Absurd as it was, such had been\r\nthe general impression, and Monroe was believed to have been one of\r\nthe most emphatic in maintaining it. “Ask him,” suggested Randolph,\r\n“what he would have done, while governor of Virginia and preparing to\r\nresist Federal usurpation, had such an attempt been made by Mr. Adams\r\nand his ministers, especially in 1800. He _can_ give the answer.”\r\nDoubtless the silence of the Constitution in respect to conscription\r\nwas conclusive to some minds in favor of the power; but the people\r\npreferred the contrary view, the more because militia service seemed to\r\ngive more pay for less risk.\r\n\r\nThe chance of carrying such a measure through Congress was not\r\ngreat, yet Monroe recommended it as his first plan for raising men.\r\nHe proposed to enroll the free male population between eighteen and\r\nforty-five years of age into classes of one hundred, each to furnish\r\nfour men and to keep their places supplied.[376] The second plan\r\nvaried from the first only in the classification, not in the absence\r\nof compulsion. The militia were to be divided into three sections\r\naccording to age, with the obligation to serve, when required, for a\r\nterm of two years. A third plan suggested the exemption from militia\r\nservice of every five militia-men who could provide one man for\r\nthe war. If none of these schemes should be approved by Congress,\r\nadditional bounties must be given under the actual system. Of the four\r\nplans, the secretary preferred the first.\r\n\r\nThe Senate committee immediately summoned Monroe to an interview. They\r\nwished an explanation of the failure in the recruiting service, and\r\nwere told by Monroe that the failure was chiefly due to the competition\r\nof the detached militia for substitutes.[377] The military committee\r\nof the House then joined with the military committee of the Senate in\r\nsounding the members of both bodies in order to ascertain the most\r\nrigorous measure that could be passed. According to the report of Troup\r\nof Georgia, chairman of the House committee,[378] they “found that no\r\nefficacious measure, calculated certainly and promptly to fill the\r\nregular army, could be effectually resorted to. Measures were matured\r\nand proposed by the [House] committee, but were not pressed on the\r\nHouse, from the solemn conviction that there was no disposition in the\r\nLegislature to act finally on the subject.”\r\n\r\nYet the issue was made at a moment of extreme anxiety and almost\r\ndespair. In October, 1814, the result of the war was believed to\r\ndepend on the establishment of an efficient draft. The price of United\r\nStates six-per-cents showed better than any other evidence the opinion\r\nof the public; but the military situation, known to all the world,\r\nwarranted deep depression. Sir George Prevost, about to be succeeded\r\nby an efficient commander,--Sir George Murray,--was then at Kingston\r\norganizing a campaign against Sackett’s Harbor, with an army of twenty\r\nthousand regular troops and a fleet that controlled the Lake. Another\r\ngreat force, military and naval, was known to be on its way to New\r\nOrleans; and the defences of New Orleans were no stronger than those of\r\nWashington. One half the province of Maine, from Eastport to Castine,\r\nwas already in British possession.\r\n\r\nTo leave no doubt of England’s intentions, despatches from Ghent,\r\ncommunicating the conditions on which the British government offered\r\npeace, arrived from the American commissioners and were sent, October\r\n10, to Congress. These conditions assumed rights of conquest.\r\nThe British negotiators demanded four territorial or proprietary\r\nconcessions, and all were vital to the integrity of the Union. First,\r\nthe whole Indian Territory of the Northwest, including about one third\r\nof the State of Ohio, two thirds of Indiana, and nearly the entire\r\nregion from which the States of Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan were\r\nafterward created, was to be set aside forever as Indian country under\r\nBritish guaranty. Second, the United States were to be excluded from\r\nmilitary or naval contact with the Lakes. Third, they had forfeited\r\ntheir rights in the fisheries. Fourth, they were to cede a portion of\r\nMaine to strengthen Canada.\r\n\r\nThese demands, following the unparalleled insult of burning Washington,\r\nforeshadowed a war carried to extremities, and military preparations\r\nsuch as the Union had no means ready to repel. Monroe’s recommendations\r\nrested on the conviction that the nation must resort to extreme\r\nmeasures. Dallas’s financial plan could not have been suggested except\r\nas a desperate resource. Congress understood as well as the Executive\r\nthe impending peril, and stood in even more fear of it.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, when Troup’s committee refused to act, Giles\r\nreported, on behalf of the Senate committee, two military measures.\r\nThe first, for filling the regular army, proposed to extend the\r\nage of enlistment from twenty-one to eighteen years; to double the\r\nland-bounty; and to exempt from militia duty every militia-man who\r\nshould furnish a recruit for the regular service.\r\n\r\nThe second measure, reported the same day, November 5, purported to\r\nauthorize the raising an army of eighty thousand militia-men by draft,\r\nto serve for two years within the limits of their own or an adjoining\r\nState.[379] The provisions of this measure were ill-conceived,\r\nill-digested, and unlikely to answer their purpose. The moment the\r\ndebate began, the bill was attacked so vigorously as to destroy\r\nwhatever credit it might have otherwise possessed.\r\n\r\nOf all the supporters of the war, Senator Varnum of Massachusetts was\r\none of the steadiest. He was also the highest authority in the Senate\r\non matters pertaining to the militia. When Giles’s bill came under\r\ndiscussion November 16, Varnum began the debate by a speech vehemently\r\nhostile to the proposed legislation. He first objected that although\r\nthe bill purported to call for an army of eighty thousand men, “yet in\r\nsome of the subsequent sections of it we find that instead of realizing\r\nthe pleasing prospect of seeing an ample force in the field, the force\r\nis to be reduced to an indefinite amount,--which contradiction in\r\nterms, inconsistency in principle, and uncertainty in effect, cannot\r\nfail to produce mortification and chagrin in every breast.” Varnum\r\nobjected to drafting men from the militia for two years’ service\r\nbecause the principle of nine months’ service was already established\r\nby the common law. If the nation wanted a regular force, why not make\r\nit a part of the regular army without a system of drafting militia\r\n“unnecessary, unequal, and unjust?” The machinery of classification\r\nand draft was “wholly impracticable.” The limit of service to adjoining\r\nStates abandoned the objects for which the Union existed. The proffered\r\nbounties would ruin the recruiting service for the regular army; the\r\nproffered exemptions and reductions in term of duty left no permanency\r\nto the service. The bill inflicted no penalties and charged no officers\r\nwith the duty of making the draft. “I consider the whole system as\r\nresolving into a recommendation upon the patriotism of the States and\r\nTerritories and upon the patriotism of the classes.”\r\n\r\nThe justice of Varnum’s criticism could not fairly be questioned. The\r\nbill authorized the President “to issue his orders to such officers of\r\nthe militia as he may think proper,” and left the classification and\r\ndraft in the hands of these militia officers. Every drafted man who had\r\nperformed any tour of duty in the militia since the beginning of the\r\nwar was entitled to deduct a corresponding term from his two years of\r\nservice; and obviously the demand created for substitutes would stop\r\nrecruiting for the regular army.\r\n\r\nHardly had Varnum sat down when Senator Daggett of Connecticut spoke.\r\n\r\n   “The bill,” said the Connecticut senator, “is incapable of being\r\n   executed, as well as unconstitutional and unjust. It proceeds\r\n   entirely upon the idea that the State governments will lend\r\n   their aid to carry it into effect. If they refuse, it becomes\r\n   inoperative. Now, sir, will the Executives, who believe it a\r\n   violation of the Constitution, assist in its execution? I tell\r\n   you they will not.”\r\n\r\nEvery member of the Senate who heard these words knew that they\r\nwere meant to express the will of the convention which was to meet\r\nat Hartford within a month. The sentiment thus avowed was supported\r\nby another New England senator, whose State was not a party to the\r\nConvention. Jeremiah Mason of New Hampshire was second to no one in\r\nlegal ability or in personal authority, and when he followed Daggett\r\nin the debate, he spoke with full knowledge of the effect his words\r\nwould have on the action of the Hartford Convention and of the State\r\nexecutives.\r\n\r\n   “In my opinion,” he said, “this system of military conscription\r\n   thus recommended by the Secretary of War is not only\r\n   inconsistent with the provisions and spirit of the Constitution,\r\n   but also with all the principles of civil liberty. In atrocity\r\n   it exceeds that adopted by the late Emperor of France for the\r\n   subjugation of Europe.... Such a measure cannot, it ought not to\r\n   be submitted to. If it could in no other way be averted, I not\r\n   only believe, but I hope, it would be resisted.”\r\n\r\nMason pointed to the alternative,--which Massachusetts was then\r\nadopting, as the necessary consequence of refusing power to the\r\ngovernment,--that the States must resume the powers of sovereignty:\r\n\r\n   “Should the national defence be abandoned by the general\r\n   government, I trust the people, if still retaining a good\r\n   portion of their resources, may rally under their State\r\n   governments against foreign invasion, and rely with confidence\r\n   on their own courage and virtue.”\r\n\r\nAt that time the State of Massachusetts was occupied for one hundred\r\nmiles of its sea-coast by a British force, avowedly for purposes of\r\npermanent conquest; and the State legislature, October 18, refused to\r\nmake an inquiry, or to consider any measure for regaining possession\r\nof its territory, or to co-operate with the national government for\r\nthe purpose,[380] but voted to raise an army of ten thousand men.\r\nThe object of this State army was suggested by Christopher Gore, the\r\nFederalist senator from Massachusetts who followed Mason in the debate.\r\nIn personal and political influence Gore stood hardly second to Mason,\r\nand his opinions were likely to carry the utmost weight with the\r\nconvention at Hartford. With this idea necessarily in his mind, Gore\r\ntold the Senate,--\r\n\r\n   “This [bill] is the first step on the odious ground of\r\n   conscription,--a plan, sir, which never will and never ought to\r\n   be submitted to by this country while it retains one idea of\r\n   civil freedom; a plan, sir, which if attempted will be resisted\r\n   by many States, and at every hazard. In my judgment, sir, it\r\n   should be resisted by all who have any regard to public liberty\r\n   or the rights of the several States.”\r\n\r\nThese denunciations were not confined to New England. Senator\r\nGoldsborough of Maryland, also a Federalist, affirmed that the\r\nsentiment of abhorrence for military duty was almost universal:--\r\n\r\n   “Sir, you dare not--at least I hope you dare not--attempt a\r\n   conscription to fill the ranks of your regular army. When\r\n   the plan of the Secretary of War made its appearance, it was\r\n   gratifying to find that it met with the abhorrence of almost\r\n   every man in the nation; and the merit of the bill before you,\r\n   if such a measure can be supposed to have merit at all, is\r\n   that it is little else, as regards the militia, than a servile\r\n   imitation of the secretary’s plan.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when Goldsborough took his seat the Senate passed the\r\nMilitia Bill by a vote of nineteen to twelve,--Anderson of Tennessee\r\nand Varnum of Massachusetts joining the Federalists in opposition. The\r\nRegular Army Bill, which was in effect a bill to sacrifice the regular\r\narmy, passed November 11, without a division. Both measures then went\r\nto the House and were committed, November 12, to the Committee of the\r\nWhole.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily such a measure would have been referred to the Military\r\nCommittee, but in this instance the Military Committee would have\r\nnothing to do with the Senate bill. Troup, the chairman, began the\r\ndebate by denouncing it.[381] The measure, he said, was inadequate to\r\nits object. “It proposed to give you a militia force when you wanted,\r\nnot a militia, but a regular force.... You have a deficiency of\r\ntwentyodd thousand to supply. How will you supply it? Assuredly the\r\n[Regular Army] bill from the Senate will not supply it. No, sir, the\r\nrecruiting system has failed.” On the nature of the force necessary\r\nfor the next campaign Troup expressed his own opinion and that of his\r\ncommittee, as well as that of the Executive, in language as strong as\r\nhe could use at such a time and place. “If, after what has happened,\r\nI could for a moment believe there could be any doubt or hesitation\r\non this point, I would consider everything as lost; then indeed there\r\nwould be an end of hope and of confidence.” Yet on precisely this point\r\nCongress showed most doubt. Nothing could induce it to accept Troup’s\r\nview of the necessity for providing a regular army. “The bill from the\r\nSenate,” remonstrated Troup, “instead of proposing this, proposes to\r\nauthorize the President to call upon the States for eighty thousand raw\r\nmilitia; and this is to be our reliance for the successful prosecution\r\nof the war! Take my word for it, sir, that if you do rely upon it (the\r\nmilitary power of the enemy remaining undivided) defeat, disaster, and\r\ndisgrace, must follow.”\r\n\r\nThe House refused to support Troup or the President. Calhoun was first\r\nto yield to the general unwillingness, and declared himself disposed\r\nto accept the Senate bill as a matter of policy. Richard M. Johnson,\r\nthough sympathizing with Troup, still preferred to accept the bill as\r\nthe only alternative to nothing: “If it was rejected, they would have\r\nno dependence for defence but on six months’ militia.”[382] On the\r\nother hand, Thomas K. Harris of Tennessee protested that if the British\r\ngovernment had it in their power to control the deliberations of\r\nCongress, they could not devise the adoption of a measure of a military\r\ncharacter better calculated to serve their purposes. The people, he\r\nsaid, were in his part of the country prepared to make every sacrifice,\r\nand expected Congress, after the news from Ghent, to do its share; but\r\nCongress was about to adopt a measure of all others the best calculated\r\nto prolong the war.[383]\r\n\r\nWhile the friends of the government spoke in terms of open\r\ndiscouragement and almost despair of the strongest military measure\r\nwhich Congress would consent to consider, the Federalists made no\r\nconcealment of their wishes and intentions. Daniel Webster used\r\nsimilar arguments to those of his friend Jeremiah Mason in the Senate,\r\naffirming that the same principle which authorized the enlistment of\r\napprentices would equally authorize the freeing of slaves,[384] and\r\nechoing pathetic threats of disunion.[385] Other Federalists made no\r\nprofessions of sadness over the approaching dissolution of government.\r\nArtemas Ward of Massachusetts spoke December 14, the day before the\r\nHartford Convention was to meet, and announced the course which events\r\nwere to take:[386]--\r\n\r\n   “That the Treasury is empty I admit; that the ranks of the\r\n   regular army are thin I believe to be true; and that our country\r\n   must be defended in all events, I not only admit but affirm.\r\n   But, sir, if all the parts of the United States are defended, of\r\n   course the whole will be defended. If every State in the Union,\r\n   with such aid as she can obtain from her neighbors, defends\r\n   herself, our whole country will be defended. In my mind the\r\n   resources of the States will be applied with more economy and\r\n   with greater effect in defence of the country under the State\r\n   governments than under the government of the United States.”\r\n\r\nSuch avowals of the intent to throw aside Constitutional duties were\r\nnot limited to members from New England. Morris S. Miller of New York\r\nmade a vehement speech on the failure of national defence, and declared\r\nthe inevitable result to be “that the States must and will take care\r\nof themselves; and they will preserve the resources of the States for\r\nthe defence of the States.”[387] He also declared that conscription\r\nwould be resisted, and echoed the well-remembered declamation of Edward\r\nLivingston against the Alien Bill in 1798, when the Republican orator\r\nprayed to God that the States would never acquiesce in obedience to the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n“This House,” replied Duvall of Kentucky, “has heard discord and\r\nrebellion encouraged and avowed from more than one quarter.” Indeed,\r\nfrom fully one fourth of its members the House heard little else. Under\r\nthe shadow of the Hartford Convention the Federalist members talked\r\nwith entire frankness. “This great fabric seems nodding and tottering\r\nto its fall,” said Z. R. Shipherd of New York, December 9;[388] “and\r\nHeaven only knows how long before the mighty ruin will take place.”\r\nJ. O. Moseley of Connecticut “meant no improper menace” by predicting\r\nto the House, “if they were determined to prosecute the war by a\r\nrecourse to such measures as are provided in the present bill, that\r\nthey would have no occasion for future committees of investigation into\r\nthe causes of the failure of their arms.”[389] The latest committee\r\nof investigation had recently made a long report on the capture of\r\nWashington, carefully abstaining from expressing opinions of its own,\r\nor imputing blame to any one, and Moseley’s remark involved a double\r\nsneer. None of these utterances were resented. Richard Stockton of\r\nNew Jersey was allowed unanswered to denounce in measured terms the\r\nmild Militia Bill then under debate, from which the committee had\r\nalready struck the term of two years’ service by substituting one year;\r\nand Stockton concluded his fine-drawn arguments by equally studied\r\nmenace:[390]--\r\n\r\n   “This bill also attacks the right and sovereignty of the\r\n   State governments. Congress is about to usurp their undoubted\r\n   rights,--to take from them their militia. By this bill we\r\n   proclaim that we will have their men, as many as we please, when\r\n   and where and for as long a time as we see fit, and for any\r\n   service we see proper. Do gentlemen of the majority seriously\r\n   believe that the people and the State governments will submit\r\n   to this claim? Do they believe that all the States of this\r\n   Union will submit to this usurpation? Have you attended to the\r\n   solemn and almost unanimous declaration of the legislature of\r\n   Connecticut? Have you examined the cloud arising in the East? Do\r\n   you perceive that it is black, alarming, portentous?”\r\n\r\nThe Resolution of the Connecticut legislature to which Stockton\r\nreferred was adopted in October, and authorized the governor in case\r\nof the passage of the Militia Bill to convoke the General Assembly\r\nforthwith, to consider measures “to secure and preserve the rights and\r\nliberties of the people of this State, and the freedom, sovereignty,\r\nand independence of the same.”[391] Stockton’s speech was made December\r\n10, and “the cloud arising in the East,” as he figured the Hartford\r\nConvention, was to take form December 15. The Republican speakers\r\nalmost as earnestly used the full influence of these national fears\r\nto rouse the energies of the House. They neither denied nor disguised\r\nthe helplessness of government. All admitted dread of approaching\r\ndisaster. Perhaps C. J. Ingersoll was the only member who declared that\r\nthe war had been successful, and that Americans need no longer blush\r\nto be Americans; but Ingersoll disliked the Militia Bill as cordially\r\nas it was disliked by Troup or Varnum, and voted for it only because\r\n“something must be done.”[392]\r\n\r\n   “When our army,” said Samuel Hopkins of Kentucky, in closing the\r\n   debate, “is composed of a mere handful of men, and our treasury\r\n   empty so that it cannot provide for this gallant handful;\r\n   when an enemy, powerful and active, is beating against our\r\n   shores like the strong wave of the ocean; when everything is\r\n   at stake,--... surely such is not the moment for parsimonious\r\n   feelings in raising taxes, or for forced constructions to defeat\r\n   the means for raising men.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding every effort of the war-leaders, the opposition\r\nsteadily won control over the House. Daniel Webster during his entire\r\nlifetime remembered with satisfaction that he shared with Eppes the\r\ncredit of overthrowing what he called Monroe’s conscription.[393]\r\nDecember 10, at Eppes’s motion, the House voted by a majority of\r\nsixty-two to fifty-seven to reduce the term of service from two years\r\nto one.[394] A motion made by Daniel Webster to reduce the term to six\r\nmonths was lost by only one voice, the vote standing seventy-eight to\r\nseventy-nine.[395] The bill passed at last, December 14, by a vote of\r\neighty-four to seventy-two, in a House where the true war majority was\r\nforty-six. When the Senate insisted on its provision of two years’\r\nservice, Troup, in conference committee, compromised on eighteen\r\nmonths. Then the House, December 27, by a vote of seventy-three to\r\nsixty-four, rejected the report of its conference committee. The next\r\nday, December 28, in the Senate, Rufus King made an unpremeditated\r\nmotion for indefinite postponement. Some members were absent; no debate\r\noccurred. The question was immediately put, and carried by a vote of\r\nfourteen to thirteen.[396] The effect of this action was to destroy the\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nWith this failure the attempt to supply an army was abandoned, and\r\nCongress left the government to conduct the war in 1815, as in 1814,\r\nwith thirty thousand regular troops and six months’ militia. Monroe’s\r\neffort to fill the ranks of the army ended in doubling the land-bounty;\r\nin authorizing the enlistment of minors, who had till then been\r\nenlisted without authorization; and in exempting from militia duty such\r\npersons as should furnish a recruit for the regular army.[397] The\r\nprospect was remote that such inducements could do more than repair\r\nthe waste of the actual force; but the government was unable to pay a\r\nlarger number even if the force could be raised, and Monroe was obliged\r\nto prepare for the next campaign with such slight means of defence as\r\nremained to him. The last effort to induce the House to consider a\r\nserious method of raising troops was made February 6, and was referred\r\nto the Committee of the Whole, with a tacit understanding that the\r\nordinary process of recruiting was not to be disturbed.[398] According\r\nto the returns in the adjutant-general’s office, the whole number of\r\nmen--non-commissioned officers, privates, musicians, and artificers,\r\npresent or absent, sick or well--in the regular army Feb. 16, 1815,\r\nwas thirty-two thousand one hundred and sixty. During the previous\r\ntwo months it had remained stationary, the returns of December, 1814,\r\nreporting thirty-two thousand three hundred and sixty men. Nothing\r\nshowed a possibility of greatly increasing the force by the means\r\nprescribed by Congress.\r\n\r\nThe navy requiring little new legislation, readily obtained the\r\nlittle it asked. Almost the first Act of the session, approved Nov.\r\n15, 1814, authorized the purchasing or building of twenty sixteen-gun\r\nsloops-of-war. Another Act of Feb. 7, 1815, created a Board of\r\nCommissioners for the navy to discharge all the ministerial duties of\r\nthe secretary, under his superintendence.\r\n\r\nThis legislation, with the various tax-bills, comprised all that was\r\naccomplished by Congress between the months of September and February\r\ntoward a vigorous prosecution of the war. For the navy the prospect\r\nof success in the coming year was sufficiently fair, and privateering\r\npromised to be more active than ever; but the army was threatened with\r\nmany perils. The most serious of all dangers to the military service\r\nof the Union was supposed by Federalists to be the establishment of\r\narmies by the separate States. The attempt to establish such an army\r\nby Massachusetts in time of peace had been one of the causes which\r\nled to the Constitution of 1789;[399] and at the close of 1814,\r\nwhen Massachusetts voted to raise an army of ten thousand men, the\r\nsignificance of the step was more clearly evident than in the time of\r\nthe Confederation.\r\n\r\nThe State of Massachusetts might be supposed to act in a spirit of\r\nhostility to the Constitution; but no such motive actuated States\r\noutside of New England. If they followed the same course, they did\r\nso because the national government was believed to be incompetent to\r\nthe general defence. Of all the States Massachusetts alone possessed\r\nconsiderable resources, and could command both credit and specie; yet\r\nthe creation of a State army of ten thousand men overburdened her\r\nfinances, and obliged her to claim her share of the national revenues.\r\nNo other State could expect to support an army without immediate\r\nfinancial trouble. Yet Governor Tompkins of New York recommended to the\r\nlegislature in September the establishment of a State army of twenty\r\nthousand men,[400] and the legislature passed Acts for the purpose. The\r\nlegislature of Pennsylvania took a similar measure into consideration.\r\nThe legislature of Maryland passed an Act for raising five thousand\r\nState troops. Virginia decided also to create a State army, with two\r\nmajor-generals. South Carolina passed a law for raising a brigade of\r\nState troops, and appointed the officers. Kentucky took measures for\r\nraising a State army of ten thousand men.\r\n\r\nThe national government, unable to create an efficient army of its\r\nown, yielded to necessity, and looked already to the State armies as\r\nlevies to be taken into the national service in case of need. The\r\nStates, on their side, unable to bear the expense of separate armies,\r\nexpected to be relieved of the burden by the national government. Yet\r\nfor the moment the States, however deficient their means might be,\r\nseemed better able than the general government not only to raise men\r\nbut to support them. In January, 1815, the financial resources of the\r\ngovernment were exhausted, so that the Treasury could not meet the\r\ndrafts drawn by Major-General Jackson and the pressing demands of\r\nthe paymaster at New Orleans. The Secretary of War was obliged to go\r\nfrom bank to bank of Washington and Georgetown asking, as a personal\r\nfavor, loans of their bank-notes already depreciated about fifty per\r\ncent. So desperate, according to Monroe’s account, was the situation\r\nthat his success depended on adding his own guaranty to that of the\r\ngovernment.[401] At no time of his life were Monroe’s means sufficient\r\nto supply his private needs, and nothing could express so strongly his\r\nsense of national bankruptcy as the assertion that his credit was\r\nrequired to support that of the United States.[402]\r\n\r\nThe State armies were the natural result of such a situation. Congress\r\ncould not resist the movement, and passed an Act, approved Jan. 27,\r\n1815, authorizing the President to receive into the national service a\r\ncertain proportion of the State troops, not exceeding forty thousand\r\nmen in the aggregate. Little was said in debate on the bearings of\r\nthe Act, which seemed to concede the demand of Massachusetts that\r\nthe States should be allowed to raise troops at the expense of the\r\nUnited States. The Hartford Convention had then met, deliberated, and\r\nadjourned. Its report had been published, and among its demands was one\r\nthat “these States might be allowed to assume their own defence.” The\r\nFederalists considered the Act of Jan. 27, 1815, as a “full and ample”\r\nconcession of the demand.[403] Senator Gore wrote to Governor Strong,\r\nJanuary 22, while the measure was before the President, commenting on\r\nthe financial and military expedients of Dallas and Monroe:[404]\r\n\r\n   “These appear to me the spasms of a dying government.... The\r\n   bill authorizing the raising of State troops by the States,\r\n   and at the expense of the United States, according to the\r\n   plan sent you some time since, has passed both Houses. Thus\r\n   one part of the recommendation of the Hartford Convention\r\n   seems to be adopted. The other,--that to authorize the States\r\n   to receive the taxes,--will probably be more difficult to be\r\n   attained. The accession to this seems not to accord with Mr.\r\n   Monroe’s intimation in your letter, or rather in his letter\r\n   to you. Indeed, if they have fears of the State governments,\r\n   one can hardly account for this government’s authorizing the\r\n   States to raise and keep in pay, at the expense of the United\r\n   States, troops which may be used for purposes hostile to, or not\r\n   conformable with, the views of the paymaster.”\r\n\r\nThe accession to the principle of State armies which surprised\r\nGore could be explained only by the government’s consciousness of\r\nhelplessness. Gore was somewhat careful to express no opinion of the\r\nprobable consequences, but other Federalists spoke with entire candor.\r\nTimothy Pickering expected a division of the Union.[405] Less extreme\r\npartisans looked only to a dissolution of government. A year afterward,\r\nin the calmer light of peace and union, Joseph Hopkinson, a very\r\ndistinguished Federalist of Philadelphia, not deluded like the New\r\nEnglanders by local pride or prejudice, declared publicly in Congress\r\nthe common conviction of his party on the probable consequences of\r\nanother year of war:[406]\r\n\r\n   “The federal government was at the last gasp of existence.\r\n   But six months longer and it was no more. ... The general\r\n   government would have dissolved into its original elements; its\r\n   powers would have returned to the States from which they were\r\n   derived; and they doubtless would have been fully competent to\r\n   their defence against any enemy. Does not everybody remember\r\n   that all the great States, and I believe the small ones too,\r\n   were preparing for this state of things, and organizing their\r\n   own means for their own defence?”\r\n\r\nCalhoun contradicted Hopkinson and denied his assertions; but on that\r\nsubject Hopkinson was at least an equal authority. Calhoun knew well\r\nhis own State, but he knew little of New England; and he had yet to\r\nlearn, perhaps to his own surprise, how easily a section of the Union\r\ncould be wrought to treason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Massachusetts legislature issued, October 17, its invitation to\r\nthe New England States for a conference,[407] and on the same day\r\nthe newspapers published the despatches from Ghent, to August 20,\r\ncontaining British conditions of peace,--which required, among greater\r\nsacrifices, a cession of Massachusetts territory, and an abandonment\r\nof fisheries and fishing rights conceded with American independence.\r\nTwo counties of the State beyond the Penobscot were then in British\r\nmilitary possession, and a third, Nantucket, was a British naval\r\nstation. Yet even under these circumstances the British demands did not\r\nshock the Federalist leaders. Governor Strong, after reading the Ghent\r\ndocuments October 17, wrote to Pickering at Washington,[408]--\r\n\r\n   “If Great Britain had discovered a haughty or grasping spirit,\r\n   it might naturally have excited irritation; but I am persuaded\r\n   that in the present case there is not a member of Congress who,\r\n   if he was a member of Parliament, would have thought that more\r\n   moderate terms ought in the first instance to have been offered.”\r\n\r\nThe argument seemed to prove only that members of Congress could also\r\nbe haughty and grasping; but Governor Strong thought the British\r\ndemands reasonable, and began at once to sound his friends in regard\r\nto the proposed concessions. The following day he wrote[409] that the\r\nEssex people expected to lose the fisheries, but were ready to give up\r\na portion of Maine to retain them.\r\n\r\nPickering wrote in reply, acquiescing in the proposed barter of\r\nterritory for fisheries, and also in the more extravagant British\r\ndemands for the Indians and the Lakes. “I was gratified,” said\r\nPickering,[410] “to find my own sentiments corresponding with yours.”\r\nThe leading Federalists united with Pickering and Strong in blaming\r\nthe American negotiators and the government for rejecting the British\r\noffers. The same view was taken by the chief Federalist newspaper of\r\nthe State, the Boston “Centinel.”[411]\r\n\r\nThus in the November election, a few weeks later, two issues were\r\nimpressed on the people of New England. In regard to neither issue did\r\nthe Federalist leaders attempt concealment. The people were invited, as\r\nfar as the press of both parties could decide the points of dispute,\r\nto express their opinion,--first, whether the British conditions of\r\npeace should have been taken into consideration; second, whether the\r\nStates should be represented at the Hartford Convention. The popular\r\nresponse was emphatic. Everywhere in New England the Republican\r\ncandidates were defeated; and the Federalists, encouraged by the\r\nresult,--believing the Hartford Convention to be the most popular\r\naction taken by Massachusetts since the State adopted the Federal\r\nConstitution,[412]--prepared to support measures, looking to the\r\nrestoration of peace and to the establishment of a new Federal compact\r\ncomprising either the whole or a portion of the actual Union.\r\n\r\nHowever varied the wishes of the majority might be, they agreed in\r\nrequiring a radical change in the organic law. This intention was\r\ntheir chief claim to popularity. The Boston “Centinel,” announcing\r\nNovember 9 the adhesion of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the Hartford\r\nConvention, placed over the announcement the head-line, “Second and\r\nthird Pillars of a new Federal Edifice reared.” During November and\r\nDecember, almost every day, the newspapers discussed the question what\r\nthe convention should do; and the chief divergence of opinion seemed to\r\nregard rather the immediate than the ultimate resort to forcible means\r\nof stopping the war. The extremists, represented in the press by John\r\nLowell, asked for immediate action.\r\n\r\n   “Throwing off all connection with this wasteful war,”--wrote “A\r\n   New England Man” in the “Centinel” of December 17,--“making\r\n   peace with our enemy and opening once more our commerce with the\r\n   world, would be a wise and manly course. The occasion demands it\r\n   of us, and the people at large are ready to meet it.”\r\n\r\nApparently Lowell was right. The people showed no sign of unwillingness\r\nto meet any decision that might be recommended by the convention. As\r\nthe moment approached, the country waited with increasing anxiety for\r\nthe result. The Republican press--the “National Intelligencer” as\r\nwell as the Boston “Patriot”--at first ridiculed the convention, then\r\ngrew irritable, and at last betrayed signs of despair. On both sides\r\nthreats were openly made and openly defied; but in Massachusetts the\r\nUnited States government had not five hundred effective troops, and if\r\nthe convention chose to recommend that the State should declare itself\r\nneutral and open its ports, no one pretended that any national power\r\nexisted in Massachusetts capable of preventing the legislature from\r\ncarrying the recommendation into effect if it pleased.\r\n\r\nFrom immediate extravagance Massachusetts was saved by the leaders\r\nwho, knowing the popular excitement, feared lest the convention should\r\nbe carried too fast into disorder, and for that reason selected\r\nrepresentatives who could be trusted to resist emotion. When George\r\nCabot was chosen as the head of the State delegation, the character\r\nof the body was fixed. The selection of Cabot did not please the\r\nadvocates of action. Pickering wrote to Lowell suggesting doubts\r\nwhether Cabot was the fittest choice.[413] Lowell replied that he\r\nshared these doubts, and that in consequence he had been led to oppose\r\nthe convention altogether, because it would not withdraw the State\r\nresources from the general government.[414] Cabot, he said, was “most\r\nreluctantly dragged in like a conscript to the duty of a delegate;” he\r\nhad always been despondent as to the course of public affairs, and felt\r\nno confidence in the possibility of awakening the people to their true\r\ndisease,--which was not the war or the Union, but democracy. Lowell\r\ndid not know “a single bold and ardent man” among the Massachusetts or\r\nConnecticut delegates. In the “Centinel” of December 7 he described\r\nCabot’s tendencies in language evidently intended as a warning to Cabot\r\nhimself:--\r\n\r\n   “There are men who know that our troubles are not the offspring\r\n   of this war alone, and will not die with it. But they despair\r\n   of relief, and think resistance unavailing. They consider the\r\n   people in their very nature democratic, and that nothing but the\r\n   severity of their sufferings has driven them from those men and\r\n   that system out of which have grown all our evils; that should\r\n   they be restored to that state of prosperity which they once\r\n   enjoyed, the same passions and opinions would diffuse themselves\r\n   through the country, and the same course of conduct be again\r\n   followed out.”\r\n\r\nCabot shocked Pickering by expressing all his favorite political views\r\nin one brief question: “Why can’t you and I let the world ruin itself\r\nits own way?”[415] Such a turn of mind was commonly the mark of a\r\nsceptical spirit, which doubted whether the world at best was worth the\r\ntrouble of saving; and against this inert and indifferent view of human\r\naffairs New England offered a constant protest. Yet the Massachusetts\r\ndelegation to Hartford was in sympathy with Cabot, while the\r\nMassachusetts legislature seemed to sympathize with Pickering. William\r\nPrescott, another member of the delegation, was chiefly remarkable for\r\nprudence and caution; Nathan Dane bore the same stamp; Harrison Gray\r\nOtis took character and color from his surroundings. The Connecticut\r\ndelegation--James Hillhouse, Chauncey Goodrich, Roger M. Sherman, and\r\nothers--were little likely to recommend “effectual measures.” The\r\nconvention consisted of men supposed to be inclined to resist popular\r\npressure, and Cabot was probably serious in replying to a young friend\r\nwho asked him what he was to do at Hartford: “We are going to keep you\r\nyoung hot-heads from getting into mischief.”[416]\r\n\r\nIn the Council Chamber of the State House at Hartford the delegates\r\nassembled, December 15, and gave instant evidence of their intention\r\nto discourage appeals to popular emotion. Their earliest steps decided\r\ntheir whole course. They chose George Cabot as their President, and\r\nthey made their sessions secret. Under no circumstances could the\r\nconvention have regarded itself as a popular body, for the delegates\r\nnumbered only twenty-three persons, mostly cautious and elderly men,\r\nwho detested democracy, but disliked enthusiasm almost as much. Two\r\nnew members, appointed by popular meetings in New Hampshire, were\r\nnext admitted; and toward the close of the sessions another member,\r\nrepresenting the county of Windham in Vermont, was given a seat. Thus\r\nenlarged, the convention over which George Cabot presided numbered\r\ntwenty-six members besides the secretary, Theodore Dwight.\r\n\r\nExcess of caution helped to give the convention an air of conspiracy,\r\nwhich warned future conspirators to prefer acting, or appearing to act,\r\nin public. The secrecy of the Hartford conference was chiefly intended\r\nto secure freedom for the exchange of opinion, and also in some degree\r\nto prevent premature excitement and intrusion of popular feeling; but\r\nthe secrecy created a belief that the debates would not bear publicity.\r\nPossibly much was said which verged on treasonable conspiracy; but\r\nthe members were not men of a class likely to act beyond their\r\ninstructions, and they adhered strictly to the practical task imposed\r\non them. Some years afterward, Harrison Gray Otis, laboring to clear\r\nhis political reputation from the stigma of membership, caused the\r\nofficial journal of the convention to be published; and the record,\r\nthough revealing nothing of what was said, proved that nothing was\r\nformally done or proposed which contradicted the grave and restrained\r\nattitude maintained in its public expressions.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of its meeting the convention appointed a committee to\r\nconsider and report upon the business to be done. Chauncey Goodrich,\r\nOtis, and three other members formed this committee, which reported\r\nthe next day the points in dispute between the States and the national\r\ngovernment,--the militia power, conscription power, duty and means of\r\ndefence, and matters of a like nature. After two days of discussion,\r\nthe convention appointed another committee to frame a general project\r\nof measures, and again placed a Connecticut man--Nathaniel Smith--at\r\nits head, with Otis second. Still another committee was appointed,\r\nDecember 21, to prepare a report showing the reasons which guided the\r\nconvention to its results; and of that committee Otis was chairman.\r\n\r\nClearly, Otis took the chief burden of business; and the result could\r\nscarcely fail to reflect in some degree the character of the man as\r\nwell as of the body for which he was acting. Though ambitious of\r\nleading, Otis never led. John Lowell described his character, as it\r\nwas understood in Boston, perhaps somewhat harshly, for Otis was no\r\nfavorite with any class of men who held fixed opinions:[417]--\r\n\r\n   “Mr. Otis is naturally timid and frequently wavering,--to-day\r\n   bold, and to-morrow like a hare trembling at every breeze. It\r\n   would seem by his language that he is prepared for the very\r\n   boldest measures, but he receives anonymous letters every day\r\n   or two threatening him with bodily harm. It seems the other\r\n   party suspect his firmness. He is sincere in wishing thorough\r\n   measures, but a thousand fears restrain him.”\r\n\r\nOtis was the probable author of the report, adopted December 24,\r\nrecommending a course to the convention; and he was chairman of the\r\nlarger committee to which that report was referred, and within which\r\nthe final report--after a discussion lasting from December 24 to\r\nDecember 30--was framed. The discussions, both in committee and in\r\nconvention, took much time and caused some difficulties; but nothing\r\nwas ever known of the speeches made, or of the motions proposed, or\r\nof the amendments offered. All the reports were finally adopted by\r\nthe convention; and all proposed business then having been finished,\r\nJanuary 5 the convention adjourned without day, authorizing Cabot to\r\ncall another meeting at Boston if he should at any time see occasion\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nThe report, therefore, contained all the information which the\r\nconvention intended to make public, and only from that document could\r\nthe ultimate object of the members be inferred. It was immediately\r\npublished in Connecticut, and at the meeting of the legislatures of\r\nMassachusetts and Connecticut in January it was laid before them for\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nConsidering the conservative temper of the delegates and their dislike\r\nfor extreme measures, the report bore striking evidence of the popular\r\npassion which urged them forward. A few paragraphs in its first pages\r\nshowed the spirit of its recommendations, and a few more showed the\r\neffect expected from them:--\r\n\r\n   “It is a truth not to be concealed that a sentiment prevails\r\n   to no inconsiderable extent ... that the time for a change is\r\n   at hand.... This opinion may ultimately prove to be correct;\r\n   but as the evidence on which it rests is not yet conclusive,\r\n   ... some general considerations are submitted in the hope of\r\n   reconciling all to a course of moderation and firmness which may\r\n   ... probably avert the evil, or at least insure consolation and\r\n   success in the last resort.... A severance of the Union by one\r\n   or more States against the will of the rest, and especially in\r\n   time of war, can be justified only by absolute necessity.”\r\n\r\nHaving thus discouraged precipitation, and argued in favor of firm\r\nand moderate measures as a probable means of preserving the Union,\r\nthe report sketched the limits of the Union that was to be preserved.\r\nIn a paragraph closely following the precedent of the Virginia\r\nResolutions of 1798, the report asserted the right and duty of a State\r\nto “interpose its authority” for the protection of its citizens from\r\ninfractions of the Constitution by the general government. In the\r\nimmediate crisis, this interposition should take the form of State laws\r\nto protect the militia or citizens from conscriptions and drafts; of\r\nan arrangement with the general government authorizing the States to\r\nassume their own defence, and to retain “a reasonable portion of the\r\ntaxes collected within the said States” for the purpose; and of State\r\narmies to be held in readiness to serve for the defence of the New\r\nEngland States upon the request of the governor of the State invaded.\r\n\r\nSuch measures involved the establishment of a New England\r\nConfederation. The proposed union of the New England States for their\r\nown defence ignored any share to be taken by the general government in\r\nthe defence of the national territory, and reduced that government to\r\nhelplessness. What could be done by New England might be done by all;\r\nand the Federalists assumed that all would be obliged to do it.\r\n\r\nIf the general government should reject the request for the proposed\r\narrangement, the ultimate emergency must arise; but with the measures\r\nto be then taken the convention would not interfere.\r\n\r\n   “It would be inexpedient for this convention to diminish\r\n   the hope of a successful issue to such an application by\r\n   recommending, upon supposition of a contrary event, ulterior\r\n   proceedings. Nor is it indeed within their province. In a\r\n   state of things so solemn and trying as may then arise, the\r\n   legislatures of the States, or conventions of the whole people,\r\n   or delegates appointed by them for the express purpose in\r\n   another convention, must act as such urgent circumstances may\r\n   then require.”\r\n\r\nBesides the measures of urgency which must be immediately accepted by\r\nthe national government, the convention recommended seven amendments\r\nto the Constitution; but on these no immediate action was required.\r\nThe single issue forced on the government by the convention was that\r\nof surrendering to Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island “a\r\nreasonable portion of the taxes collected within said States,” and\r\nconsenting to some arrangement “whereby the said States may, separately\r\nor in concert, be empowered to assume upon themselves the defence of\r\ntheir territory against the enemy.” If the United States government\r\nshould decline such an arrangement, the State legislatures were to send\r\ndelegates to another convention to meet at Boston, June 15, “with such\r\npowers and instructions as the exigency of a crisis so momentous may\r\nrequire.”\r\n\r\nWhile the convention was preparing its report, from December 15 to\r\nJanuary 5, the public waited with the utmost curiosity for the result.\r\nMajor Jesup, famous at Chippawa and Lundy’s Lane, was then recruiting\r\nfor the Twenty-fifth United States Infantry at Hartford, and reported\r\nconstantly to the President and War Department; but he could tell\r\nnothing of the convention that was not notorious. His letters were\r\nmere surmises or unmilitary comments on the treasonable intentions of\r\nthe meeting.[418] The Federalists knew no more than was known to the\r\nRepublicans; but while they waited, they expressed fear only lest the\r\nconvention should fall short of their wishes.\r\n\r\n   “I care nothing more for your actings and doings,” wrote\r\n   Gouverneur Morris to Pickering in Congress.[419] “Your decree\r\n   of conscriptions and your levy of contributions are alike\r\n   indifferent to one whose eyes are fixed on a star in the East,\r\n   which he believes to be the day-spring of freedom and glory. The\r\n   traitors and madmen assembled at Hartford will, I believe, if\r\n   not too tame and timid, be hailed hereafter as the patriots and\r\n   sages of their day and generation.”\r\n\r\nAs far as newspapers reflected public opinion, the people of New\r\nEngland held the same views as those expressed by Gouverneur Morris.\r\nThe Boston “Centinel” contained, December 28, an address to the\r\nHartford Convention announcing that the once venerable Constitution\r\nhad expired: “At your hands, therefore, we demand deliverance. New\r\nEngland is unanimous. And we announce our irrevocable decree that the\r\ntyrannical oppression of those who at present usurp the powers of the\r\nConstitution is beyond endurance. And we will resist it.” A meeting at\r\nReading in Massachusetts, January 5, pledged itself to make no more\r\nreturns for taxation and to pay no more national taxes until the State\r\nshould have made its decision known.\r\n\r\nA newspaper paragraph copied by the Federalist press[420] advised\r\nthe President to provide himself with a swifter horse than he had at\r\nBladensburg if he meant to attempt to subjugate the Eastern States.\r\n“He must be able to escape at a greater rate than forty miles a day, or\r\nthe swift vengeance of New England will overtake the wretched miscreant\r\nin his flight.” Such expressions of the press on either side were of\r\nlittle authority, and deserved no great attention; but the language\r\nof responsible and representative bodies could not be denied weight.\r\nOpposition to the convention seemed cowed. Apparently the State was\r\nready for immediate action; and the convention, in recommending a delay\r\nof six months, risked general disapproval.\r\n\r\nWhile the public was in this temper, the convention adjourned, and its\r\nreport was given to the press. No one doubted that moderate men would\r\napprove it. The only persons whose approval was in question were “bold\r\nand ardent” partisans, like Gouverneur Morris, Pickering, and John\r\nLowell, who wanted instant action. Chiefly for the sake of unanimity,\r\nthese men gave in their adhesion. John Lowell hastened to publish his\r\nacquiescence in the convention’s report.[421] Pickering also approved\r\nit, although Pickering’s approval was partly founded on the belief\r\nthat the Union was already dissolved, and no further effort in that\r\ndirection need be made.\r\n\r\n   “If the British succeed in their expedition against New\r\n   Orleans,” Pickering wrote to Lowell,[422]--“and if they have\r\n   tolerable leaders I see no reason to doubt of their success,--I\r\n   shall consider the Union as severed.\r\n\r\n   This consequence I deem inevitable. I do not expect to see a\r\n   single representative in the next Congress from the Western\r\n   States.”\r\n\r\nGovernor Strong and Senator Gore also approved the convention’s report.\r\nOn receiving it at Washington, January 14, Gore wrote to Strong: “The\r\nresult of the Hartford Convention is here, and affords satisfaction\r\nto most if not to all,--to some because they see not the point nor\r\nconsequence of the recommendation as relates to taxes.” The point and\r\nconsequence of that recommendation were clear to Gore, and he approved\r\nof both.\r\n\r\nIf any leading Federalist disapproved the convention’s report, he left\r\nno record of the disapproval. In such a case, at such a moment, silence\r\nwas acquiescence. As far as could be inferred from any speeches made\r\nor letters written at the time, the Federalist party was unanimous in\r\nacquiescing in the recommendations of the Hartford Convention.\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts and Connecticut the acquiescence was express. The\r\nlegislature, convened at Boston, January 18, hastened to refer the\r\nconvention’s report to a joint committee, which reported, January 24,\r\nResolutions that the legislature “do highly approve” the proceedings of\r\nthe convention, and that State commissioners should immediately proceed\r\nto Washington to effect the arrangement proposed.[423] By a very large\r\nmajority of three to one, the legislature adopted the Resolutions,\r\nmaking the acts of the convention their own. Three commissioners were\r\nquickly appointed,--Harrison Gray Otis at their head,--and in the early\r\ndays of February started for Washington.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts was then more than ever convinced that it must\r\nperemptorily insist on taking its share of the national revenue into\r\nits own hands. Already the first step toward providing a State army had\r\nplunged the State treasury into financial difficulties, and measures\r\nfor defence were stopped until new resources could be obtained. To\r\nthe surprise of Governor Strong, the Massachusetts banks, restrained\r\nby their charters, applied to the State government the same rigorous\r\nrefusal of credit which they had applied to the national government,\r\nand Strong found himself unable to obtain even the loan of one million\r\ndollars authorized by the legislature at its autumn session. The\r\nmiscarriage cast a shade of ridicule on the character of the State\r\nwhich criticised so severely the failure of the national government\r\nto defend it, and found itself unable to take the first step toward\r\ndefence without the aid of the national government, bankrupt and\r\nimpotent though it was. Governor Strong sent to the legislature on\r\nthe first day of its winter session a message[424] that might have\r\nbeen sent by Madison to Congress. He reminded the legislature that it\r\nhad, by a Resolution of Oct. 11, 1814, authorized a loan of a million\r\ndollars from the banks.\r\n\r\n   “At that time,” continued Strong’s message, “it was supposed\r\n   that there would be no difficulty in procuring the requisite\r\n   sums from that source, and the treasurer soon obtained loans to\r\n   a considerable amount; but the directors of some of the banks\r\n   declared themselves unable to lend, and others have expressed\r\n   such reluctance as forbids an expectation that the whole amount\r\n   can be obtained in that way during the continuance of the\r\n   present cautious operations of the banks.”\r\n\r\nThe treasurer had obtained $631,000, and with the expenditure of that\r\nsum the work of defence and the organization of the State army ceased.\r\n“The efforts of defensive preparation which were made in this State\r\nthe last year,” Governor Strong declared, “will, if continued at the\r\nexpense of the Commonwealth, be fatal to our finances.” The necessary\r\nconsequence followed, that the State must take the national revenues.\r\nAccordingly the committee of both Houses, to which the subject was\r\nreferred, reported[425] an approval of suspending the organization\r\nof State troops “until in virtue of some arrangement to be made with\r\nthe national government sufficient funds can be provided for their\r\npay and support, without recourse to additional taxes.” Under such\r\ncircumstances the national government was little likely to surrender\r\nits resources, and every symptom showed that the State then meant to\r\nseize them.\r\n\r\nThe same committee formally approved the governor’s course in\r\ndeclining to co-operate with the national government in expelling the\r\nenemy from Maine. The public excuse for the refusal was founded on the\r\ncondition of the Treasury. In Federalist society the weightier motive\r\nwas supposed to be the wish to leave on the national government the\r\nodium of failure to defend the State.[426]\r\n\r\nWhile Massachusetts sustained the Hartford Convention, and pressed to\r\nan issue the quarrel with the national government, Connecticut acted\r\nwith equal zeal in the same sense. The governor, John Cotton Smith, was\r\nan old man, and neither his opinions nor his passions were extreme; but\r\nas far as concerned the Hartford Convention, his views differed little\r\nfrom those of Pickering and Lowell. He called a special session of the\r\nlegislature for January 25, to act on the delegates’ report; and his\r\nspeech at the opening of the session would have been taken for irony,\r\nhad his moderation of character not been known.[427] “The temperate and\r\nmagnanimous course proposed for our adoption cannot fail to allay the\r\napprehensions which many have professed to entertain, and to enliven\r\nthe hopes of all who cherish our national Union, and are disposed to\r\nplace it on a solid and durable basis.” The legislature without delay\r\napproved the measures recommended by the convention, and appointed\r\ndelegates to accompany those sent from Massachusetts to effect the\r\nproposed arrangement with the government at Washington.\r\n\r\nIn later times the Hartford Convention was often and vigorously\r\ndefended by writers whose works were friendly to the national\r\ngovernment, and whose influence was popular.[428] The wisdom, loyalty,\r\nand patriotism of George Cabot and his associates became the theme\r\nof authors whose authority was above dispute. Nearly always the\r\ndefence rested on the argument that popular opinion went beyond the\r\nconvention’s report, and that the convention risked its credit by\r\nrefusing to advise instant withdrawal from the Union.[429] This view\r\nwas apparently correct. The efforts of the moderate Federalists to\r\npraise the moderation of the report, and the labored protests of the\r\nextremists against the possible suspicion that they objected to its\r\nmoderation,[430] showed that the convention was then believed to have\r\noffered resistance to what Governor Smith stigmatized as “rash councils\r\nor precipitate measures.” The tone of the press and the elections bore\r\nout the belief that a popular majority would have supported an abrupt\r\nand violent course.\r\n\r\nThe tone of the minority at the time showed a similar belief that\r\nMassachusetts favored disunion. During all the proceedings of the State\r\nlegislatures and the convention, the loyal press and citizens never\r\nceased to point out the dangerous, treasonable, and absurd results to\r\nbe expected from the course pursued. In the Massachusetts Senate John\r\nHolmes of Maine attacked the convention and its doings in a speech\r\nthat gave him wide reputation.[431] Threats of civil war were freely\r\nuttered and defied. Among the least violent of Federalists was James\r\nLloyd, recently United States senator from Massachusetts; and to him\r\nas a man of known patriotism John Randolph addressed a letter, Dec.\r\n15, 1814, remonstrating against the Hartford Convention that day to\r\nmeet. Lloyd replied in a letter also published, advising Randolph and\r\nthe Virginians to coerce Madison into retirement, and to place Rufus\r\nKing in the Presidency as the alternative to a fatal issue.[432] The\r\nassertion of such an alternative showed how desperate the situation was\r\nbelieved by the moderate Federalists to be.\r\n\r\nA long letter of a similar kind was written, Nov. 26, 1814, by Jonathan\r\nMason to Wilson Cary Nicholas.[433] The opinion of the men among whom\r\nMason lived was expressly declared by Mason to the effect that “Great\r\nBritain will not treat with Mr. Madison. He must retire, or the country\r\nand the Union are at an end.... This is plain language, but in my soul\r\nI believe it true. We shall not be destroyed to-day or to-morrow, but\r\nit will come; and the end of these measures [of the Administration]\r\nwill be disunion and disgrace.”\r\n\r\nIn the Republican party the belief was universal that the Hartford\r\nConvention could lead only to a New England Confederation; and the\r\nbelief was not confined to partisans. An anecdote that George Ticknor\r\ndelighted in telling, illustrated the emotion that then agitated men\r\nfar beyond the passing and fitful excitements of party politics.\r\nTicknor, a young Federalist twenty-three years old, wished for letters\r\nof introduction to Virginia, and asked them from John Adams, then a man\r\nof eighty, whose support of the war made him an object of antipathy to\r\nthe party he had led.\r\n\r\n   “When I visited him in Quincy to receive these letters,” related\r\n   Ticknor,[434] “I had a remarkable interview with him, which at\r\n   the time disturbed me not a little.... Soon after I was seated\r\n   in Mr. Adams’s parlor,--where was no one but himself and Mrs.\r\n   Adams, who was knitting,--he began to talk of the condition of\r\n   the country with great earnestness. I said not a word; Mrs.\r\n   Adams was equally silent; but Mr. Adams, who was a man of strong\r\n   and prompt passions, went on more and more vehemently. He was\r\n   dressed in a single-breasted dark-green coat, buttoned tightly\r\n   by very large white metal buttons over his somewhat rotund\r\n   person. As he grew more and more excited in his discourse,\r\n   he impatiently endeavored to thrust his hand into the breast\r\n   of his coat. The buttons did not yield readily; at last he\r\n   _forced_ his hand in, saying, as he did so, in a very loud\r\n   voice and most excited manner: ‘Thank God! thank God! George\r\n   Cabot’s close-buttoned ambition has broke out at last: he wants\r\n   to be President of New England, sir!’”\r\n\r\nWhether George Cabot wanted it or not, he was in danger of becoming\r\nwhat John Adams predicted. He was far from being the first man who had\r\nunwillingly allowed himself to be drawn into a position from which\r\nescape was impossible. After going so far, neither leaders nor people\r\ncould retreat. The next and easy step of sequestrating the direct and\r\nindirect taxes was one to which the State stood pledged in the event of\r\na refusal by President Madison and Congress to surrender them. After\r\nsuch an act, the establishment of a New England Confederation could\r\nhardly be matter of choice.\r\n\r\nIf so considerable a mass of concurrent testimony did not prove the\r\ngravity of the occasion, as it was understood by the most intelligent\r\nand best-informed men of the time, ample evidence could be drawn from\r\nother sources. William Wirt described the painful anxiety of Madison\r\nas early as the month of October. Throughout Virginia the depression\r\nwas akin to despair. John Randolph and Wilson Cary Nicholas gave\r\nexpression to it in letters to prominent New Englanders; but Jefferson\r\nin private was still more pronounced in his fears. “The war, had it\r\nproceeded, would have upset our government,” he wrote to Gallatin a\r\nyear later,[435] “and a new one, whenever tried, will do it.” George\r\nTicknor, after obtaining at Quincy his letter of introduction from\r\nJohn Adams to Jefferson, delivered it at Monticello at a time when the\r\nanxiety for the safety of New Orleans was acute. He found Jefferson\r\nconvinced that the city must fall, and Jefferson expressed the\r\nexpectation that the British would hold it indefinitely.[436] Pickering\r\nfelt the same conviction, and regarded the event as a dissolution of\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nThe “Federal Republican” of Baltimore published, January 5, the day\r\nwhen the Hartford Convention adjourned, a letter from Washington\r\nannouncing “an explosion at hand; that the President would be called on\r\nto resign; and there must be peace by that or a future Administration.”\r\nThe fall of New Orleans was to be the signal for a general demand that\r\nMadison should resign, and the Federalist press already prepared the\r\nground by insisting that “Mr. Madison has scarcely raised his little\r\nfinger to preserve New Orleans,” and would finally determine to abandon\r\nthe State of Louisiana.[437] That Madison’s authority could survive\r\ntwo such blows as the capture of Washington and the loss of Louisiana\r\nseemed improbable; but that he should resign was impossible, though the\r\nalternative was a collapse of government.\r\n\r\nWhen the month of February arrived, government and people were waiting\r\nwith keen apprehension for some new disaster, and the least probable\r\nsolution was that England knowing the situation would consent to any\r\ntolerable peace. The “Federal Republican” of January 28, commenting on\r\nthe expected bank veto, summed up the consequences, not unfairly from\r\nits point of view, in few words:--\r\n\r\n   “It is impossible, as Mr. Giles said in his luminous and\r\n   eloquent argument upon the measure [of a national bank], that\r\n   the government can stand these reiterated shocks.... The\r\n   interest upon the public debt remains unpaid, and there exists\r\n   not the means, without making the most ruinous sacrifices, to\r\n   pay it. The government is in arrears to the army upward of\r\n   nine million dollars; to the navy, about four millions.... The\r\n   condition of our finances is known to the enemy; and is it\r\n   possible he will be such a fool as to give us peace, after the\r\n   mortal blow we aimed at him, when he knows we cannot pay the\r\n   interest on the public debt, that we cannot pay our army or our\r\n   navy, and when he finds us unable to defend any part of the\r\n   country at which he strikes?”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    A GENERAL MAP OF THE\r\n    SEAT OF WAR IN LOUISIANA\r\n    AND WEST FLORIDA,\r\n\r\n    _Shewing all the fortified points and encampments\r\n    of both the American and\r\n    British Armies; also the march of Gen.\r\n    Jackson’s Army on his expedition\r\n    against Pensacola._\r\n\r\n    BY MAJOR A.

Lieutenant-General Lord Hill was to command the combined\r\nland-forces.[438] These orders were given before the arrival of a long\r\nreport from Vice-Admiral Cochrane concerning the military condition\r\nof the American territories on the Gulf of Mexico, which Cochrane\r\nconsidered such “that he had no doubt in his mind that three thousand\r\nBritish troops landed at Mobile, where they would be joined by all the\r\nIndians, with the disaffected French and Spaniards, would drive the\r\nAmericans entirely out of Louisiana and the Floridas.”[439]\r\n\r\nCircumstances induced the British government to defer sending Lord\r\nHill, with a large force, to the Gulf; and Cochrane was informed by\r\na despatch, dated August 10, that Major-General Ross was directed to\r\ncarry out the Vice-Admiral’s plans, which required fewer men.[440]\r\nOrders were sent to Ross, of the same date, informing him that\r\nreinforcements amounting to more than twenty-one hundred rank-and-file\r\nwere preparing to sail from England, which with the Fifth West India\r\nregiment and two hundred black pioneers from Jamaica would enable Ross\r\nto carry more than five thousand effective rank-and-file to the theatre\r\nof his operations.[441]\r\n\r\nRoss’s detailed instructions were dated September 6.[442] They began\r\nby recounting the force which was intended to act against New Orleans.\r\nThe brigade from the Gironde which Ross took to the Chesapeake was\r\nestimated at about twenty-three hundred effectives, and a battalion\r\nwhich he had taken from Bermuda was supposed to have raised his\r\nrank-and-file to thirty-four hundred men. In addition to this force,\r\na brigade under Major-General Keane, numbering twenty-one hundred and\r\nfifty men, was under orders for Jamaica, which with the black troops\r\nwould enable Ross to proceed to his destination “with near six thousand\r\nmen, exclusive of the marines and seamen.... About the same time you\r\nwill be joined by the First West India regiment from Guadeloupe.”\r\n\r\nThe objects which rendered the success of the expedition “extremely\r\nimportant” were two: first, the command of the mouth of the\r\nMississippi, so as to deprive the back settlements of America of their\r\ncommunication with the sea; second, “to occupy some important and\r\nvaluable possession by the restoration of which we may improve the\r\nconditions of peace, or which may entitle us to exact its cession as\r\nthe price of peace.”\r\n\r\nThe point of attack was left to the discretion of Cochrane and Ross.\r\nThey might proceed directly against New Orleans, or move in the\r\nfirst instance into the back parts of Georgia and the country of the\r\nfriendly Indians. In either case, the second object in view could not\r\nbe attained against the will of the inhabitants. “With their favor and\r\nco-operation, on the other hand, we may expect to rescue the whole\r\nprovince of Louisiana from the United States.”\r\n\r\n   “If therefore you shall find in the inhabitants a general and\r\n   decided disposition to withdraw from their recent connection\r\n   with the United States, either with the view of establishing\r\n   themselves as an independent people or of returning under the\r\n   dominion of the Spanish Crown, you will give them every support\r\n   in your power; you will furnish them with arms and clothing, and\r\n   assist in forming and disciplining the several levies, provided\r\n   you are fully satisfied of the loyalty of their intentions,\r\n   which will be best evinced by their committing themselves in\r\n   some act of decided hostility against the United States....\r\n   You will discountenance any proposition of the inhabitants to\r\n   place themselves under the dominion of Great Britain; and\r\n   you will direct their disposition toward returning under the\r\n   protection of the Spanish Crown rather than to the attempting\r\n   to maintain what it will be much more difficult to secure\r\n   substantially,--their independence as a separate State; and you\r\n   must give them clearly to understand that Great Britain cannot\r\n   pledge herself to make the independence of Louisiana, or its\r\n   restoration to the Spanish Crown, a _sine qua non_ of peace\r\n   with the United States.”\r\n\r\nAfter occupying New Orleans, Ross and Cochrane were to decide whether\r\nany further military operations could be carried on; and if nothing\r\nof material importance could be attempted, they were to send the\r\ndisposable part of their force to Bermuda.\r\n\r\nRoss’s report of the capture of Washington reached Lord Bathurst\r\nSeptember 27, and caused so much satisfaction that the British\r\ngovernment decided to show its approval by placing another\r\nmajor-general, Lambert, with a brigade numbering twenty-two hundred\r\nrank-and-file, under Ross’s command, to be used without restriction,\r\neither in the Middle or the Southern States.[443] The Prince Regent\r\nhighly applauded the ability with which Ross had conducted the capture\r\nof Washington, “an enterprise so creditable to his Majesty’s arms,\r\nand so well calculated to humble the presumption of the American\r\ngovernment, which contrary to the real interests, and as it is believed\r\ncontrary to the prevailing wish, of the nation has involved that\r\ncountry in an unnecessary and unjust war against his Majesty.”[444]\r\nOnly in one respect did Bathurst hint a criticism on the course pursued\r\nby Ross. While informing him, September 29, that reinforcements were\r\non their way which would place upward of ten thousand men under his\r\ncommand, to be used very much at his discretion, Bathurst added,[445]--\r\n\r\n   “You and your troops have gained great credit in the discipline\r\n   you observed at Washington. It is no disparagement of your\r\n   merit to say that it was prudent as well as merciful to show\r\n   such forbearance. If, however, you should attack Baltimore, and\r\n   could, consistent with that discipline _which it is essential\r\n   for you not to relax_, make its inhabitants _feel_\r\n   a little more the effects of your visit than what has been\r\n   experienced at Washington, you would make that portion of the\r\n   American people experience the consequences of the war who have\r\n   most contributed to its existence.”\r\n\r\nWhen this despatch was written, Ross had made his attack on Baltimore,\r\nand had failed. The report of his failure and death was received by the\r\nWar Department in London October 17, and Bathurst as soon as possible\r\nselected a new commander for the expedition to New Orleans. Orders,\r\ndated October 24, were sent to Major-Generals Sir Edward Pakenham and\r\nGibbs to join Vice-Admiral Cochrane forthwith, detailing the force at\r\ntheir command. Pakenham was to follow the instructions already given\r\nto Ross, and was especially enjoined to conciliate the people of\r\nLouisiana:--\r\n\r\n   “You will for that purpose cause the force under your command\r\n   to observe the strictest discipline; to respect the lives and\r\n   the property of all those who are inclined to a peaceable\r\n   deportment, and by no means to excite the black population to\r\n   rise against their masters.”\r\n\r\nThe “Statira” received orders, October 28, to convey Major-Generals\r\nPakenham and Gibbs to the rendezvous at Negril Bay in Jamaica, whither\r\nthe large force intended for New Orleans was already moving from\r\nseveral distant quarters. The day for beginning the movement on New\r\nOrleans was already fixed for November 20, and Pakenham could at that\r\nseason hardly expect to reach Jamaica in time to sail with his troops.\r\nMeanwhile the English press talked openly of the expedition and its\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nMilitary District No. 7, in which New Orleans and Mobile were\r\nsituated, had not been neglected by the United States government.\r\nThe regular force assigned by Secretary Armstrong for its defence\r\nconsisted of five regiments of United States Infantry,--the Second,\r\nThird, Seventh, Thirty-ninth, and Forty-fourth, with three hundred\r\nand fifty artillerists,--an aggregate of two thousand three hundred\r\nand seventy-eight men. The provision was relatively liberal. District\r\nNo. 5, on Chesapeake Bay, contained an aggregate of two thousand two\r\nhundred and eight regular troops; District No. 6, including North and\r\nSouth Carolina and Georgia, was allotted two thousand two hundred and\r\nforty-four men. One half the regular army was employed in such garrison\r\nduty, and a greater number could not have been allotted consistently\r\nwith retaining an army in the field. Indeed, the only means by which\r\nArmstrong could provide so strong a defence, aggregating nearly eight\r\nthousand men, for the Southern States was by stripping Massachusetts.\r\nDistrict No. 1, including Massachusetts and Maine, contained only\r\nsix hundred and fifty-five regular troops; and District No. 2,\r\nincluding Rhode Island and Connecticut, contained only seven hundred\r\nand fourteen. Besides the regular troops, New Orleans enjoyed the\r\nprotection of gunboats and one or two larger armed vessels. The city\r\nneeded only an efficient commander to defy any ordinary attack.\r\n\r\nArmstrong supplied a commander who might, as he believed, be safely\r\nconsidered efficient. In the month of May Andrew Jackson was appointed\r\nto the command of Military District No. 7, with headquarters at\r\nMobile. At that moment Jackson, having finished the Creek war, was\r\nabout to make the necessary arrangements for the future control of the\r\nCreek nation, and he did not take immediate command of his district.\r\nNo occasion for haste existed. During the summer of 1814 no British\r\nforce of consequence approached the Gulf of Mexico, or was likely to\r\napproach it until the frosts began. Jackson was detained in the centre\r\nof Alabama, undisturbed by fears for New Orleans, until the so-called\r\nTreaty or Capitulation of August 9 with the Creeks released him from\r\nfurther duties in that region. He left the Creek country August 11,\r\nwith his regular troops, going by water down the Alabama River, and\r\narriving at Mobile about August 15.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment government was brought to a stand-still at\r\nWashington by the appearance of General Ross’s army in the Patuxent,\r\nand the raids on Washington and Baltimore. Between August 20 and\r\nSeptember 25 the War Department could do little more than attend to\r\nits own pressing dangers. Jackson was left independent, substantially\r\ndictator over the Southwest. If New England carried out its intentions,\r\nand the government sank, as seemed probable, into helplessness, his\r\ndictatorship was likely to be permanent.\r\n\r\nWhen Jackson arrived at Mobile, August 15, the defence of New Orleans\r\nwas not in his mind. The people of Tennessee and Georgia had long\r\nbeen bent on the seizure of the Floridas, and Jackson had been one of\r\nthe most ardent in favoring the step. The Creek war and the escape of\r\nthe hostile Creeks to East Florida strengthened his conviction that\r\nthe Spaniards must be expelled. He had begun the war with the idea\r\nof pushing his army directly through the Creek country to Pensacola,\r\nwhich he meant to hold.[446] The instant he succeeded in destroying\r\nthe military power of the Creeks, he began preparations for invading\r\nFlorida. As early as July he wrote to the War Department suggesting an\r\nattack on Pensacola:--\r\n\r\n   “Will you only say to me, Raise a few hundred militia (which\r\n   can be quickly done), and with such a regular force as can be\r\n   conveniently collected, make a descent upon Pensacola and reduce\r\n   it?”[447]\r\n\r\nAt the same time Jackson entered, July 12, into an angry correspondence\r\nwith the Spanish governor of Pensacola, and requested him to deliver\r\nup the Creek warriors who had taken refuge in East Florida,--a demand\r\nwith which he knew that the Spaniard had no means of complying. August\r\n10 he wrote to Armstrong announcing that he had given orders for the\r\nreoccupation of Mobile Point. “The United States in possession of\r\nPensacola and Mobile, well defended, our whole coast and country in\r\nthis quarter would be secure.”[448] A direct attack by the British on\r\nNew Orleans had not occurred to his mind.\r\n\r\nAlthough Jackson received no answer from Washington to his suggestion,\r\nhe came to Mobile, August 15, determined to pursue his object;\r\nand his decision was confirmed by the eccentric conduct of Major\r\nNicholls, an Irish officer, who was sent to Pensacola, July 23, with\r\nthe sloops-of-war “Hermes” and “Carron,” with four officers, eleven\r\nnon-commissioned officers, and ninety-seven privates of the Royal\r\nMarines, taking two howitzers, a field-piece, a thousand stand of\r\narms, and three hundred suits of clothing for the Creek warriors.[449]\r\nNicholls landed his marines, seized Fort Barrancas, disembarked arms,\r\nand began to collect the fugitive Creeks, commonly known as Red Sticks,\r\nwith a view to invading Louisiana, while he spread extravagant stories\r\nof his plans.\r\n\r\nHad the British government sent Nicholls to Pensacola expressly to\r\ndivert Jackson’s attention from New Orleans, he could not have used\r\nhis means more successfully for his purpose. Jackson at Mobile, some\r\nsixty miles away, learned within forty-eight hours what Nicholls was\r\ndoing at Pensacola, and wrote instantly, August 27, to Governor Blount\r\nof Tennessee,[450] calling out the whole quota of Tennessee militia,\r\ntwenty-five hundred men, who were to march instantly to Mobile. “It is\r\ncurrently reported in Pensacola,” he added, “that the Emperor of Russia\r\nhas offered his Britannic Majesty fifty thousand of his best troops for\r\nthe conquest of Louisiana, and that this territory will fall a prey to\r\nthe enemy before the expiration of one month.”\r\n\r\nDuring the next three months Nicholls with a mere handful of men\r\ndistracted Jackson’s whole attention. From Pensacola, August 29,\r\nNicholls issued a proclamation calling on the natives of Louisiana\r\nto assist him “in liberating from a faithless, imbecile government”\r\ntheir paternal soil.[451] A few days afterward, September 3, a British\r\nsloop-of-war, the “Sophie,” appeared at Barataria, forty miles\r\nsouth of New Orleans. There for several years smugglers and pirates\r\nhad established a station, to the scandal of society and with its\r\nconnivance.[452] Three Frenchmen, the brothers Laffite,--Jean, Pierre,\r\nand Dominique,--ruled over this community, and plundered impartially\r\nthe commerce of England and Spain, while defying the laws of the United\r\nStates and the power of the national government.[453] The British\r\nsloop-of-war brought to Jean Laffite a letter from Major Nicholls\r\nasking him and his men, with their vessels, to enter into British\r\nservice, under penalty of destruction to their establishment.[454]\r\nLaffite, preferring to make terms with the United States, and knowing\r\nthat the authorities at New Orleans were about to break up his\r\nestablishment in any case, sent to Governor Claiborne the letters he\r\nreceived from Captain Lockyer of the “Sophie,” and offered his services\r\nto defend Barataria.\r\n\r\nNothing in these demonstrations suggested a direct attack on New\r\nOrleans. Nicholls constantly gave out that he meant to attack Mobile,\r\nand from there “push for New Orleans;”[455] but his force was wholly\r\ninadequate, and his rank was much too low, to warrant the belief that\r\nhe intended a serious campaign. Yet such noisy and insulting conduct\r\nwas adapted to irritate a man of Jackson’s temper, and to keep his\r\nattention fixed on Mobile and Pensacola. Nicholls even undertook to\r\nannoy Jackson in his headquarters.\r\n\r\nOn a bare sand-point at the entrance of Mobile Bay, General Wilkinson,\r\non taking possession of Mobile in April, 1818, established a battery\r\nwhich he armed with Spanish cannon. The redoubt, which was called\r\nFort Bowyer, could not hold against a land attack properly supported,\r\nand offered a temptation to the enemy; but in the absence of a land\r\nforce competent to besiege it, the fortification was useful to close\r\nthe entrance of Mobile Bay against marauders. In Fort Bowyer Jackson\r\nplaced one hundred and sixty men of the Second United States Infantry,\r\ncommanded by Major William Lawrence. Twenty guns were mounted on the\r\nplatforms, but according to the American account only two twenty-four\r\npounders and six twelve-pounders were likely to prove serviceable.[456]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    PLAN\r\n\r\n    Shewing the Attack made by a\r\n    BRITISH SQUADRON\r\n    ON\r\n    Fort Bowyer at Mobile Pt.\r\n    ON THE 15 SEPTR., 1815.\r\n\r\n    By MAJOR A. LACARRIERE LATOUR,\r\n    Principal Engineer 7th Military Dist., U.S. Army, 1815.]\r\n\r\nThe British force at Pensacola consisted chiefly of four sloops,\r\ncommanded by Captain W. H. Percy,--the “Hermes,” twenty-two guns, the\r\n“Carron,” twenty, and the “Sophie” and “Childers” of eighteen guns\r\neach. The usual armament of such vessels consisted of thirty-two-pound\r\ncarronades, with two long-nines or sixes. Apparently the British\r\nsquadron threw thirty-four thirty-two-pound shot, and four nine\r\nor six pound balls at a broadside. Whether the armament was greater\r\nor smaller mattered little, for Captain Percy was unable to use with\r\neffect the batteries of either the “Carron” or the “Childers.” With\r\nmuch difficulty, owing to the shoals, he brought his squadron within\r\nrange of Fort Bowyer, and with more gallantry than discretion prepared\r\nfor the attack.\r\n\r\nAccording to the British account, the land force at Percy’s command\r\nconsisted of sixty marines and one hundred and twenty Indians, with\r\none five-and-a-half-inch howitzer. According to the American account,\r\na twelve-pound field-piece was placed ashore in battery with the\r\nhowitzer. Such a force was insufficient to do more than intercept the\r\ngarrison if it should be driven out of the fort. The brunt of the\r\naction fell on the ships, and experience did not warrant Percy in\r\nbelieving that his sloops, with their carronades, could silence a work\r\nlike Fort Bowyer.\r\n\r\nNevertheless Percy gallantly made the attempt. At half-past four of\r\nthe afternoon of September 15, he brought the “Hermes” close in, and\r\nopened fire within musket-shot of the fort. The “Sophie” came to anchor\r\nsome distance astern, but within range. The “Carron” and the “Childers”\r\nanchored so far out that their carronades were useless, and apparently\r\neven the American twenty-four-pounders did not touch them. The “Hermes”\r\nand the “Sophie” alone sustained injury,[457] but their experience was\r\ndecisive. After an hour’s action, the cable of the “Hermes” being\r\ncut, she became unmanageable, and at last grounded and was abandoned.\r\nCaptain Percy set her on fire, and carried his crew, including the\r\nwounded, with much difficulty to his other vessels. The “Sophie”\r\nwithdrew from fire, and the squadron returned at once to Pensacola.\r\n\r\nAssuming that Captain Percy could use with effect only the twenty guns\r\nof the broadsides of the “Hermes” and “Sophie” against the twenty\r\nguns of the fort, the American gunnery was evidently superior to the\r\nBritish. The “Hermes” lost twenty-five men killed and twenty-four\r\nwounded,--a very severe loss in a crew which could not much have\r\nexceeded one hundred and fifty men. A better test of marksmanship was\r\noffered by the “Sophie,” which received comparatively little attention\r\nfrom the fort, but lost six killed and sixteen wounded. The whole\r\nAmerican loss was reported as four killed and five wounded,[458] under\r\nthe combined fire of both ships at close range, the fort having no\r\ncasemates, and parapets only on the front and flanks.[459] Three guns\r\nwere dismounted.\r\n\r\nGreatly pleased by this success, Jackson issued a\r\ncounter-proclamation[460] to the people of Louisiana, somewhat in the\r\nstyle of that which Nicholls had issued three weeks before.\r\n\r\n   “The base, the perfidious Britons,” it began, “have attempted\r\n   to invade your country. They had the temerity to attack Fort\r\n   Bowyer with their incongruous horde of Indians and negro\r\n   assassins.... The proud, vain-glorious boaster Colonel Nicholls,\r\n   when he addressed you, Louisianians and Kentuckians, had\r\n   forgotten that you were the votaries of freedom.... I ask you,\r\n   Louisianians, can we place any confidence in the honor of men\r\n   who have courted an alliance with pirates and robbers? Have not\r\n   these noble Britons, these honorable men, Colonel Nicholls and\r\n   the honorable Captain W. H. Percy, the true representatives of\r\n   their royal master, done this? Have they not made offers to the\r\n   pirates of Barataria to join them and their holy cause? And have\r\n   they not dared to insult you by calling on you to associate as\r\n   brethren with them and this hellish banditti?”\r\n\r\nWith the exception of this proclamation and another[461] of the same\r\ndate to the free negroes of Louisiana, Jackson paid no attention to the\r\ndefence of New Orleans, but left it entirely to Governor Claiborne.\r\nHe disregarded a memorial from the citizens, dated September 18,\r\nurging his personal attention and presence. “My whole force would not\r\nsatisfy the demands they make,” he wrote to the War Department, October\r\n10.[462] “As soon as security is given to this section of my district,\r\nwhich is first indispensably necessary, I shall hasten to New Orleans,”\r\nhe wrote from Mobile, October 14.[463] He entertained no doubt that\r\nat Mobile he stood between the British and their object. “Unless\r\nPensacola were reduced,” said his confidential biographer[464] ten\r\nyears afterward, “it was vain to think of defending the country.... The\r\nattack on Mobile Point was a confirmation of his previous conjectures\r\nas to the views of the enemy.”\r\n\r\nThe Government at Washington became alarmed. While Jackson waited at\r\nMobile for the arrival of General Coffee with his Tennesseeans to\r\nattack Pensacola, Monroe at Washington received warnings from Europe,\r\nHalifax, and Bermuda that the British force which had just laid\r\nWashington in ashes was but a division of a larger army on its way to\r\nattack New Orleans. He wrote to Jackson, September 25,[465]--\r\n\r\n   “There is great cause to believe that the enemy have set on\r\n   foot an expedition against Louisiana, through the Mobile, in\r\n   the expectation that while so strong a pressure was made from\r\n   Canada and in this quarter, whereby the force of the country and\r\n   attention of the government would be much engaged, a favorable\r\n   opportunity would be afforded them to take possession of the\r\n   lower part of that State, and of all the country along the\r\n   Mobile.”\r\n\r\nThe President, he continued, had ordered five thousand additional\r\ntroops from Tennessee to march to Jackson’s aid, and had directed\r\nthe governor of Georgia to hold twenty-five hundred more subject to\r\nJackson’s orders. He had also sent one hundred thousand dollars in\r\nTreasury notes to Governor Blount of Tennessee, to be applied to the\r\nnecessary expenses of the campaign, and Jackson could draw on him for\r\nthe necessary funds. The orders to the governor of Tennessee were sent\r\nthe same day, September 25. A week later, October 3, Monroe wrote to\r\nGovernor Shelby of Kentucky, requesting him to send twenty-five hundred\r\nmen to Jackson. Again, October 10, Monroe wrote to Jackson, informing\r\nhim that not less than twelve thousand five hundred men were already\r\nsubject to his orders, from Kentucky, Tennessee, and Georgia:\r\n\r\n   “There is strong reason to presume, from intelligence just\r\n   received from our ministers at Ghent, that a British force\r\n   consisting of twelve or fifteen thousand men sailed from\r\n   Ireland early in September for New Orleans and the Mobile, with\r\n   intention to take possession of that city and of the country\r\n   through which the great rivers on which the whole of the United\r\n   States westward of the Alleghany Mountains so essentially\r\n   depends.”\r\n\r\nWhen Monroe received a letter from Jackson, dated September 9,\r\nindicating his intention of attacking Pensacola, the secretary replied\r\nOctober 21,[466] forbidding the step. “I hasten to communicate to\r\nyou the directions of the President that you should at present take\r\nno measures which would involve this government in a contest with\r\nSpain.” He reiterated the warning that British forces would probably\r\nbe directed against Louisiana; but he did not order Jackson to New\r\nOrleans, nor did he notify him that arms would be sent there. Not until\r\nNovember 2 were orders given that four thousand stand of arms should be\r\nsent from Pittsburg, and only November 11 and 15 were the arms shipped,\r\nnot by steamer but by the ordinary flatboat.[467] Even then the arms\r\nwere in advance of the men. The governor of Tennessee could not appoint\r\nan earlier day than November 13 for mustering the new levies, and on\r\nthat day three thousand men assembled at Nashville, while two thousand\r\ncollected at Knoxville. Not till November 20 did the Nashville division\r\nstart down the river, to arrive a month later at New Orleans.\r\n\r\nJackson quietly waited at Mobile for the twenty-five hundred men he\r\nhad summoned from Tennessee by his letter of August 27. Two months\r\nwere consumed in this manner. The Tennessee brigade, under command\r\nof General Coffee, marched promptly, and passing through the Indian\r\ncountry arrived October 25 at Mobile. Coffee brought with him somewhat\r\nmore than the number of men required by the call. His force was about\r\ntwenty-eight hundred.[468] Jackson held at Mobile the Second, Third,\r\nThirty-ninth, and Forty-fourth United States Infantry, besides some\r\nMississippi troops and Choctaw Indians.[469] With the Tennesseeans he\r\ncould dispose of more than four thousand troops.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Monroe’s warning letter of September 25, Jackson still\r\npaid no immediate attention to New Orleans. October 28 he wrote to\r\nMonroe, acknowledging a letter from him of September 27, and announcing\r\nthat he was then organizing an attack on Pensacola. Having no authority\r\nfor the act, and aware that the Government was anxious about New\r\nOrleans, he added: “I hope in a few weeks to place this quarter in\r\nperfect security, and to be able to move to New Orleans with General\r\nCoffee’s mounted men.”[470] October 31 Jackson wrote, apparently for\r\nthe first time, that he needed arms, and that half the arms of the\r\nmilitia were not fit for use.[471]\r\n\r\nTaking four thousand one hundred men,[472] without trains, Jackson\r\nmarched November 3 against Pensacola, which he occupied, November 7,\r\nwith little resistance, although “Spanish treachery,” he said,[473]\r\n“kept us out of possession of the fort until nearly twelve o’clock at\r\nnight.” The next morning the British blew up Fort Barrancas, six miles\r\nbelow, where they had established themselves, and Colonel Nicholls\r\nsailed away no farther than the Appalachicola River, leaving Jackson\r\nto do what he pleased with Pensacola, a position of no value to either\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nEven Armstrong, who favored Jackson against what he thought the\r\nill-will of Madison and Monroe, afterward condemned the movement\r\nagainst Pensacola. “The general’s attack and capture of the town on the\r\n7th of November, 1814, was to say the least of it decidedly ill-judged,\r\ninvolving at once an offence to a neutral power, and a probable\r\nmisapplication of both time and force as regarded the defence of New\r\nOrleans.”[474] Jackson remained only two days at the place, and then\r\nreturned to Mobile, where he arrived November 11 and remained until\r\nNovember 22, as though still in doubt. He detached Major Blue of the\r\nThirty-ninth United States Infantry, with a thousand mounted men, to\r\nthe Appalachicola to break up the depot established there for supplying\r\nassistance to the Red Stick Indians.[475] Nothing indicated that he\r\nfelt anxiety for the safety of New Orleans, although the British\r\nexpedition, comprising some fifty vessels, was then at Jamaica, and\r\nNovember 26 actually sailed for the Mississippi.[476]\r\n\r\nJackson’s conduct greatly alarmed the President and the Secretary of\r\nWar. When the despatches arrived at Washington announcing what was\r\ntaking place at Mobile and Pensacola, Monroe hastened to order General\r\nGaines to Mobile. He wrote to Jackson, December 7,[477]--\r\n\r\n   “General Gaines is ordered to join you and act under you in\r\n   the defence of New Orleans and of the district under your\r\n   command. Full confidence is entertained that this appointment\r\n   of an officer of his merit will afford to you a very acceptable\r\n   aid in the discharge of your highly important duties.... Much\r\n   anxiety is felt lest you should remain too long on the Mobile.\r\n   The city [New Orleans], it is presumed, is the principal\r\n   object of the enemy, and it cannot be defended on either of\r\n   the passes by which it may be approached,--one by the river\r\n   Mississippi itself, another by the Fourche, the third by Lake\r\n   Pontchartrain,--without occupying the ground bearing on these\r\n   passes.”\r\n\r\nThree days afterward, December 10, Monroe wrote again in stronger\r\nterms:[478]--\r\n\r\n“It is hoped that you will have long since taken a suitable position\r\non the river to afford complete protection to that city. Mobile is\r\na comparatively trifling object with the British government. Your\r\npresence at such a point on the river with the main body of your troops\r\nwill be of vital importance.”\r\n\r\nJackson left Mobile November 22, four days before the British\r\nexpedition under Sir Edward Pakenham sailed from Jamaica. Both Jackson\r\nand Pakenham were moving to New Orleans at the same time. Pakenham\r\nbrought with him an immense fleet and a large army. Jackson, instead\r\nof taking, as Monroe hoped, “the main body” of his troops, left at\r\nMobile the main body, consisting of the Second, Third, and Thirty-ninth\r\nregiments, about a thousand or twelve hundred men.\r\n\r\nAccording to his friend’s biography, probably founded on his own\r\ninformation, Jackson’s “principal fears at present were that\r\nMobile might fall, the left bank of the Mississippi be gained, all\r\ncommunication with the Western States cut off, and New Orleans be thus\r\nunavoidably reduced.”[479] That the British should advance against the\r\nMississippi by way of Mobile was improbable, as Monroe pointed out; but\r\nthey could have taken no course which better suited the resources of\r\nJackson. A march of near two hundred miles, through a barren and wooded\r\ncountry, with Jackson’s whole force concentrated in their front, was an\r\nundertaking that promised little success.\r\n\r\nLeaving at Mobile three regular regiments, Jackson ordered the\r\nForty-fourth regiment to New Orleans, and directed Coffee with two\r\nthousand of his mounted brigade to march to Baton Rouge. He was himself\r\nill and suffering, and made no excessive haste. “I leave this for New\r\nOrleans on the 22d instant,” he wrote to Monroe, November 20,[480] “and\r\nif my health permits, shall reach there in twelve days. I travel by\r\nland, to have a view of the points at which the enemy might effect a\r\nlanding.” Starting from Mobile November 22, he arrived at New Orleans,\r\nabout one hundred and twenty-five miles, on December 2.[481] His troops\r\nwere then much scattered. The main body was at Mobile. The Forty-fourth\r\nregiment was in march from Mobile to New Orleans, where the Seventh\r\nregiment was already stationed. A thousand volunteer horsemen, part\r\nof Coffee’s brigade, under Major Blue of the Thirty-ninth Infantry,\r\nwere scouring the Escambia, Yellow Water, and other remote Florida\r\nrecesses. The remainder of Coffee’s brigade was at Baton Rouge December\r\n4, greatly reduced by various causes, and numbering only twelve hundred\r\nmen.[482] A few Mississippi dragoons were near them. A division of\r\nTennessee militia, twenty-five hundred strong, under General Carroll,\r\nhad started from Nashville November 20, and might be expected at\r\nNew Orleans about December 20. A division of Kentucky militia, also\r\ntwenty-five hundred strong, was on its way, and might arrive about\r\nthe new year. Meanwhile the British expedition was sailing, with much\r\ndeliberation, past the shores of Cuba, toward Florida.[483]\r\n\r\nAt New Orleans nothing had yet been done for defence; but inaction\r\nwas not the worst. Jackson found the people despondent and\r\ndistrustful.[484] The legislature showed incompetence and, as\r\nJackson believed, indifference. The whole population of Louisiana\r\nwas but small, containing certainly not more than fifty thousand\r\nwhite inhabitants; while the city of New Orleans probably numbered\r\nhardly more than twenty thousand persons including slaves. The State\r\ngovernment supplied one thousand militia under the general requisition\r\nof the President.[485] The city raised a battalion of volunteers nearly\r\nthree hundred strong, a rifle company numbering sixty-two men when in\r\nthe field, and a battalion of free mulattoes, chiefly refugees from St.\r\nDomingo, which produced two hundred and ten men,--in all, between five\r\nand six hundred troops. Jackson immediately reviewed the companies,\r\nDecember 2, and could expect no further aid from these sources. No arms\r\nwere in store, even if men could be found, and none of the necessary\r\nsupplies of an army had been provided.\r\n\r\nJackson’s first act after arriving at New Orleans showed no\r\nconsciousness of danger. Armstrong, criticising his measures, afterward\r\nsaid:[486] “Had the general been better acquainted with military\r\nhistory, he would not have suffered a single day of the twenty he had\r\nfor preparation to have passed without forming one or more intrenched\r\ncamps for the protection of the city.” Instead of doing this, Jackson\r\ndid what had been done by Armstrong and Winder at Washington in\r\nAugust. Having arrived in the city December 2, he started two days\r\nafterward to inspect Fort St. Philip on the river sixty miles below. He\r\nreturned to New Orleans December 11,[487] believing that the British\r\nwould approach by the river, and prepared works to arrest their\r\nadvance.[488] He then rode out to Chef Menteur and Lake Pontchartrain\r\non the north, which he thought the next probable point of attack. He\r\nwas still absent, December 15, examining the situation of different\r\nworks northward of the city, when the British expedition struck its\r\nfirst blow.[489]\r\n\r\nSix American gunboats, the whole force on the lakes, watched the\r\nentrance of Lake Borgne through which the British must pass if they\r\nattacked New Orleans by way of the lakes. They were stationed for\r\nobservation rather than for resistance,--although for observation a few\r\nfishermen’s boats would have been more useful. The British expedition,\r\nupward of fifty sail, made land December 10,[490] and was seen by the\r\ngunboats, which retired within the lake. The British land-forces were\r\ntransferred from the heavy ships into the lighter vessels, and under\r\nconvoy of sloops-of-war entered Lake Borgne December 13. The boats of\r\nthe squadron, carrying about a thousand seamen and marines,[491] left\r\nthe ships during the night of December 12 in search of the American\r\ngunboats, which tried to escape, but were becalmed and obliged by the\r\ntide to anchor. After a tedious row of thirty-six hours the British\r\nboats overtook the gunboat flotilla December 14, and after a sharp\r\nstruggle succeeded in capturing the whole, with a loss of seventeen men\r\nkilled and seventy-seven wounded.[492] The American crews numbered one\r\nhundred and eighty-two men, and lost six killed and thirty-five wounded.\r\n\r\nNews of the capture of the gunboats, which occurred at noon December\r\n14 about forty miles to the eastward of New Orleans, arrived on the\r\nevening of December 15, and produced the utmost consternation.[493]\r\nJackson hurried back to the city, where his presence was no longer a\r\nmatter of choice but necessity. Instantly on hearing the news he sent\r\nexpresses to Coffee at Baton Rouge, and to Carroll and Thomas, wherever\r\nthey might be found on the river, urging them to hasten with all\r\npossible speed to New Orleans. He issued a proclamation to the people\r\nof the city, in which he threatened them with punishment if they were\r\nnot unanimous,[494] and at the same time he recommended the legislature\r\nto suspend the writ of habeas corpus. Finding the legislature hesitate,\r\nJackson declared martial law by proclamation[495] the same day,\r\nDecember 16, and assumed dictatorial powers.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    MAP\r\n    SHEWING THE LANDING OF THE\r\n    BRITISH ARMY\r\n\r\n    _its several Encampments and fortifications\r\n    on the Mississippi and the works\r\n    they erected on their Retreat; also the\r\n    different posts Encampments and fortifications\r\n    made by the several Corps of the\r\n    American Army during the whole campaign._\r\n\r\n    By Major A.

General Coffee above Baton Rouge received\r\nJackson’s summons on the evening of December 17, and marched the next\r\nmorning with twelve hundred and fifty men. In two days he made one\r\nhundred and twenty miles, camping on the night of December 19 within\r\nfifteen miles of New Orleans, with eight hundred men.[496] Carroll,\r\nwith the Tennessee brigade which left Nashville November 27, arrived\r\nat New Orleans December 21, and a squadron of mounted Mississippi\r\nvolunteers hurried down. The British also lost no time. Their advance\r\ndisembarked on the Isle aux Poix in Lake Borgne on the night of\r\nDecember 14, and during the following week all the boats and seamen\r\nof the fleet were occupied in transporting seven thousand men, with\r\ntheir equipment, thirty miles from the fleet to the island. During the\r\nnight of December 18 two British officers reconnoitred the head of Lake\r\nBorgne.[497] At the mouth of Bayou Bienvenu, not fifteen miles from\r\nNew Orleans, was a fishermen’s village. The fishermen were Spaniards,\r\nwith no love for the United States, and ready to accept British pay.\r\nThey received the two British officers, and conveyed them in a canoe\r\nup the bayou to the Villeré plantation on the bank of the Mississippi\r\nonly six miles from New Orleans.[498] There, at their leisure,\r\nLieutenant Peddie of the quartermaster’s department and Captain Spencer\r\nof the “Carron” selected the line of advance for the British army, and\r\nreturned, unmolested and unseen, through the bayou to the lake and the\r\nIsle aux Poix.\r\n\r\nOnly December 21, two days after the British reconnaissance, was an\r\nAmerican picket of eight men and a sergeant placed at the fishermen’s\r\nvillage,[499] where they remained thirty-six hours without learning\r\nthat British officers had been on the spot, or that the fishermen\r\nwere all away, acting as pilots for the approaching British boats.\r\nMeanwhile the troops at Isle aux Poix were ready to move almost as soon\r\nas Lieutenant Peddie could return to show them the way. At ten o’clock\r\non the morning of December 22 the light brigade--sixteen hundred and\r\neighty-eight rank-and-file,[500] under Colonel Thornton, who had led\r\nthe advance at Bladensburg--embarked in boats, and after a day on\r\nthe lake arrived the next morning, December 23, at daylight, without\r\ngiving alarm, at the fishermen’s village, where they surprised and\r\ncaptured the picket, and then passing up the bayou five miles, landed\r\nat a point about three miles from the Mississippi River. No attempt\r\nat concealment was made.[501] The troops were formed in column, and\r\nfound no obstacles to their march except the soft ground and the\r\nditches. Through reeds and cypress swamp they made their way about\r\nthree miles, when their advance suddenly entered open fields skirted\r\nby an orange-grove, with the broad Mississippi beyond. They were on\r\nthe Villeré plantation; and they surprised and captured Major Villeré\r\nand his militia company, in his own house at noon-day, after a march\r\nof three miles with sixteen hundred men, from a point which had been\r\nrecognized by Jackson as one of two or three necessary avenues of\r\napproach.\r\n\r\nThe record of American generalship offered many examples of misfortune,\r\nbut none so complete as this. Neither Hull nor Harrison, neither Winder\r\nnor Samuel Smith, had allowed a large British army, heralded long in\r\nadvance, to arrive within seven miles unseen and unsuspected, and\r\nwithout so much as an earthwork, a man, or a gun between them and their\r\nobject. The disaster was unprecedented, and could be repaired only by\r\ndesperate measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE defence of New Orleans resembled the defence of Washington\r\nuntil the moment when in each case the British expedition came within\r\nsight. Jackson was even slower than Winder to see the point of danger\r\nor to concentrate his forces. At Washington, Winder took command July\r\n1, and the British expedition arrived August 16; at Mobile, Jackson\r\ntook command August 16, and the British expedition arrived December\r\n14. In neither case was the interval seriously employed for defence.\r\nSo much was Jackson misled that he collected no troops, and made no\r\ninquiry as to the military means at his disposal at New Orleans. Had\r\nhe gone there September 1, he would have felt the want of arms and\r\nequipment, and would have been able to supply them. During the summer,\r\nwhile yet among the Creeks, he was said to have made requisition for\r\na quantity of war material to be sent to New Orleans;[502] but he\r\ncertainly showed no interest in its shipment or the causes for its\r\ndelay in arrival. The arms should have reached New Orleans in October,\r\nwhen he would have had ample time to correct any failure or want\r\nof supply. He could have used, in case of necessity, the steamboat\r\n“Enterprise,” which was then regularly plying on the Mississippi, and\r\nwas not the only steamboat on those waters.[503] If New Orleans was\r\ndeficient in many articles of military necessity, the fault was not\r\nwholly in the War Department.\r\n\r\nA similar criticism applied to the political situation at New Orleans.\r\nGovernor Claiborne wanted authority to control the factions in his\r\nlegislature, and the legislature wanted an impulse sufficiently\r\nenergetic to overcome its inertia. Probably Jackson’s presence would\r\nat any time have given authority to Claiborne and energy to the entire\r\nState government. From the moment of his actual arrival, difficulties\r\nof this kind seemed to cease. “It is hardly possible,” said the\r\nmilitary historian of the campaign,[504] “to form an idea of the change\r\nwhich his arrival produced on the minds of the people.”\r\n\r\nWhen the British expedition was once known to have appeared at the\r\nentrance of Lake Borgne, Jackson’s task was perhaps simpler than\r\nWinder’s, for Winder might doubt whether the British meant to attack\r\nWashington, and in fact General Ross took the decision only at the\r\nlast moment; but no one could doubt that New Orleans was the object\r\nof Pakenham’s expedition. Jackson had only to choose his positions\r\nand collect his resources. These were small; but on the other hand\r\nthe British were opposed by natural difficulties much greater at\r\nNew Orleans than at Washington. Even their greater numbers were\r\na disadvantage when they were obliged to move in widely separated\r\ndetachments, in open boats, from a point far distant from their\r\ncolumn’s head, and toward a point easily fortified.\r\n\r\nIf until the moment of the enemy’s appearance Jackson showed no more\r\nmilitary capacity than was shown by Winder, his conduct thenceforward\r\noffered a contrast the more striking because it proved how Washington\r\nmight have been saved. Winder lost his head when he saw an enemy.\r\nJackson needed to see his enemy in order to act; he thought rightly\r\nonly at the moment when he struck. At noon, December 23, New Orleans\r\nwas in greater danger than Washington on the afternoon of August 23,\r\nwhen the British advanced from the Patuxent. Had Colonel Thornton\r\nfollowed his impulses and marched directly on the city, he must have\r\nreached it before a gun could have been fired by the Americans; his own\r\nmuskets would have given the first news of his arrival. Major-General\r\nKeane, his commanding officer, preferred caution,[505] and his delay\r\ngave a few hours time for Jackson to show his qualities.\r\n\r\nNews that a British column had reached the Villeré plantation was\r\nbrought to Jackson at headquarters in New Orleans, at about half-past\r\none o’clock, much as the news was brought to Winder, August 24, that\r\nthe British were marching on Bladensburg. The distances were about\r\nthe same. Winder and Jackson both allowed the enemy to approach within\r\nseven miles before anything had been done for defence. In one respect\r\nJackson was more unfortunate than Winder, for his troops were not\r\nready to march; they were not even collected. Jackson sent orders to\r\nthe different corps, but several hours passed before the men could be\r\nbrought down and posted between the city and the British.\r\n\r\nFortunately Major Latour, chief-engineer in Military District No.\r\n7, had been sent that morning to examine the approaches from Lake\r\nBorgne, and as he rode down the road at noon he met persons flying\r\ntoward town with news that the British had penetrated through the\r\ncanal to Villeré’s house. Latour was a trained French engineer, whose\r\nservices were extremely valuable, not only during the campaign but\r\nafterward; for he subsequently wrote a “History of the War in West\r\nFlorida and Louisiana,” which was far the best military work published\r\nin the United States till long after that time, and furnished the\r\nonly accurate maps and documents of the campaign at New Orleans.[506]\r\nOn the morning of December 23 Latour approached within rifle-shot of\r\nthe British force, and judged their number accurately as sixteen or\r\neighteen hundred men.[507] Such exact information, which could not have\r\nbeen gained from any ordinary scout, was invaluable. Latour hastened\r\nto headquarters, and reported at two o’clock to Jackson the position\r\nand numbers of the enemy. The general, on that information, decided to\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nFor such a purpose Jackson’s resources were ample. Four miles above the\r\ncity his Tennessee militia were camped,--Carroll’s brigade numbering\r\nprobably about two thousand effectives, and the remnants of Coffee’s\r\nmounted brigade numbering some seven hundred men in the field. The\r\nMississippi and New Orleans volunteers could be reckoned at about\r\nseven hundred men,[508] besides three regiments of city militia. The\r\nSeventh United States Infantry produced four hundred and sixty-five men\r\nin the ranks; the Forty-fourth counted three hundred and thirty-one;\r\nwhile a detachment of artillerists, twenty-two in number, with two\r\nsix-pound field-pieces, added greatly to the numerical strength of the\r\nInfantry.[509] Against Thornton’s force, numbering one thousand six\r\nhundred and eighty-eight rank-and-file, or about nineteen hundred men\r\nall told, Jackson could oppose about five thousand Infantry with two\r\nfield-pieces.\r\n\r\nBesides these land forces Jackson was provided with another resource.\r\nIn the river at New Orleans lay a war-schooner, the “Carolina,”\r\nrated at fourteen guns, armed with one long twelve-pounder and\r\nsix twelve-pound carronades on a broadside.[510] A sixteen-gun\r\nsloop-of-war, the “Louisiana,” was also at New Orleans, but not\r\nready for immediate use. The “Carolina” could be brought instantly\r\ninto action, and her broadside of seven twelve-pounders, added to the\r\nfield-battery of two six-pounders, gave Jackson immense advantage\r\nover the British, who had no artillery except two three-pounders and\r\nrockets, and whose lines must be enfiladed by the “Carolina’s” fire.\r\n\r\nJackson, aware of his superiority, expected with reason to destroy the\r\nBritish detachment. He did not even think more than half his force\r\nnecessary for the purpose, but detached the whole of Carroll’s brigade\r\nand the three regiments of city militia,--fully twenty-five hundred\r\nmen,--to guard the town against an apprehended attack from the north.\r\nWithout giving the reasons which led him to believe that the British\r\ncould approach on that side without ample warning, his report said,--\r\n\r\n   “Apprehending a double attack by the way of Chef Menteur, I left\r\n   General Carroll’s force and the militia of the city posted on\r\n   the Gentilly road, and at five o’clock P.M. marched\r\n   to meet the enemy, whom I was resolved to attack in his first\r\n   position, with Major Hind’s dragoons, General Coffee’s brigade,\r\n   parts of the Seventh and Forty-fourth regiments, the uniformed\r\n   companies of militia under the command of Major Plauché, two\r\n   hundred men of color chiefly from St. Domingo, raised by\r\n   Colonel Savary and acting under the command of Major Daquin,\r\n   and a detachment of artillery under the direction of Colonel\r\n   McRea, with two six-pounders under the command of Lieutenant\r\n   Spots,--not exceeding in all fifteen hundred.”\r\n\r\nMore exact returns showed that Jackson carried with him eight hundred\r\nand eighty-four regular troops and two field-pieces, five hundred and\r\nsixty-three mounted riflemen of Coffee’s brigade, five hundred and\r\nfifty-nine Louisiana militia, one hundred and seven Mississippians, and\r\neighteen Choctaw Indians,--in all, twenty-one hundred and thirty-one\r\nmen and two guns, besides the “Carolina,” which dropped down the river\r\nat four o’clock.[511]\r\n\r\nJackson did not, like Winder, pass the hours in looking at his enemy,\r\nnor did he, like General Smith at Baltimore, send out militia under\r\nmilitia officers, to stand in close order on an open field and wait\r\nattack. His chief difficulty was due to the ground, which obliged him\r\nto make his main assault in a narrow column along the road. To gain the\r\nadvantage of his numbers, he detached Coffee with seven hundred and\r\nthirty-two men, mostly armed with rifles, to make a detour toward the\r\nleft and fall on the British flank and rear, while Jackson himself,\r\nwith fourteen hundred men and two guns, should strike the British\r\nadvance where it was posted on the levee.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    PLAN OF THE\r\n    Attack made by MAJ.-GEN. JACKSON\r\n    On a division of the British Army commanded\r\n    by\r\n    MAJOR-GEN. J. KEANE,\r\n    On the 23rd December, 1814, at 7 o’clock at night.\r\n\r\n    by MAJOR A. LACARRIERE LATOUR, principal Engineer in the\r\n    7th Military District U. S. Army.\r\n\r\n    STRUTHERS & CO., ENGR’S, N. Y.]\r\n\r\nThe signal for battle was to be given by the “Carolina’s” guns.\r\nCommodore Patterson in the “Carolina” received his orders at half-past\r\nsix, and getting out sweeps, brought his vessel in a few minutes\r\nabreast of the British camp, where he anchored close in shore and\r\nbegan a heavy fire,[512] soon after seven o’clock. Ten minutes later,\r\nJackson, waiting about two miles above, ordered his men to advance,\r\nand moving down the road with his regulars and New Orleans companies\r\nstruck the British outposts about a mile below his point of departure,\r\nat a few minutes before eight o’clock. At the same time Coffee, as he\r\nmarched along the edge of the swamp, hearing the signal, wheeled to the\r\nright, and moved toward the British flank.\r\n\r\nNight had then fallen. The weary British troops had lain down, when\r\ntheir sentries on the levee gave the alarm, and immediately afterward\r\nthe roar of seven cannon close beside them threw their camp into\r\nconfusion. About half an hour afterward, while the “Carolina” still\r\nswept the camp with its shot, the British sentries on the levee a\r\nmile above gave another alarm, and in a few moments the outposts were\r\nsharply attacked.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the battle fought along the levee, under the command\r\nof Jackson in person, were both confused and contradictory. Thornton’s\r\nbrigade was composed of the Eighty-fifth and Ninety-fifth regiments, a\r\ncompany of rocketeers, one hundred sappers and miners, and the Fourth\r\nregiment as a support,--in all, sixteen hundred and eighty-eight\r\nrank-and-file.[513] At the point where the fighting began the\r\nBritish had merely an outpost, which was forced back by Jackson’s\r\nattack, with some difficulty, about one hundred and fifty yards.[514]\r\nColonel Thornton ordered two of his regiments--the Eighty-fifth and\r\nNinety-fifth, eight hundred rank-and-file[515]--to support the outpost,\r\nand their arrival checked Jackson’s advance. Indeed, the American line\r\nwas driven back and lost ground, until the two field-pieces were in\r\ndanger, and were hastily withdrawn.[516] Each party claimed that the\r\nother first withdrew from fire; but the American report admitted that\r\nthe battle which began on the levee at eight ceased before nine, while\r\nJackson seemed not to regard his attack as successful. His first brief\r\nreport, written December 26,[517] said,--\r\n\r\n   “The heavy smoke occasioned by an excessive fire rendered it\r\n   necessary that I should draw off my troops, after a severe\r\n   conflict of upward of an hour.”\r\n\r\nJackson’s official report of December 27 said,[518]--\r\n\r\n   “There can be but little doubt that we should have succeeded on\r\n   that occasion with our inferior force in destroying or capturing\r\n   the enemy, had not a thick fog which arose about eight o’clock\r\n   occasioned some confusion among the different corps. Fearing\r\n   the consequences, under this circumstance, of the further\r\n   prosecution of a night attack with troops then acting together\r\n   for the first time, I contented myself with lying on the field\r\n   that night.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the battle was severest where Jackson commanded, it was most\r\nsuccessful where Coffee attacked. On hearing the “Carolina” open fire,\r\nCoffee turning to the right advanced on the British flank, striking\r\nit nearly opposite to the “Carolina’s” position. The British, thus\r\nsurrounded, were placed in a situation which none but the steadiest\r\ntroops could have maintained. So great was the confusion that no\r\norganized corps opposed Coffee’s men. Squads of twenty or thirty\r\nsoldiers, collecting about any officer in their neighborhood, made head\r\nas they best could against Coffee’s riflemen, and the whole British\r\nposition seemed encircled by the American fire. Forced back toward\r\nthe river, the British rallied behind an old levee which happened at\r\nthat point to run parallel with the new levee, at a distance of about\r\nthree hundred yards.[519] Knots of men, mixed in great disorder, here\r\nadvancing, there retreating, carried on a desultory battle over the\r\nfield, often fighting with clubbed weapons, knives, and fists. At last\r\nthe British centre, finding a strong protection in the old levee which\r\nanswered for an earthwork, held firm against Coffee’s further advance,\r\nand were also sheltered by the new levee in their rear from the fire of\r\nthe “Carolina’s” guns. At about the same time several companies of the\r\nTwenty-first and Ninety-third regiments arrived from Lake Borgne, and\r\nraised the British force to two thousand and fifty rank-and-file.[520]\r\nCoffee then despaired of further success, and withdrew his men from the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n   “My brigade,” wrote Coffee immediately afterward,[521] “met the\r\n   enemy’s line near four hundred yards from the river. The fire on\r\n   both sides was kept up remarkably brisk until we drove them to\r\n   the river-bank, where they gave a long, heavy fire, and finally\r\n   the enemy fell behind the levee or river-bank that is thrown\r\n   up. The battle had now lasted near two and a half hours. The\r\n   regulars had ceased firing near one hour before I drew my men\r\n   back.”\r\n\r\nThe “Carolina” began firing soon after seven o’clock, and ceased at\r\nnine.[522] Jackson’s attack with the regulars began at eight o’clock,\r\nand his force ceased firing before nine. Coffee withdrew his men\r\nat about half-past nine. The hope of destroying the British force\r\nwas disappointed; and brilliant as the affair was, its moral effect\r\nwas greater than the material injury it inflicted. Major-General\r\nKeane officially reported his loss as forty-six killed, one hundred\r\nand sixty-seven wounded, and sixty-four missing,--two hundred and\r\nsixty-seven in all.[523] Jackson reported twenty-four killed, one\r\nhundred and fifteen wounded, and seventy-four missing,--two hundred\r\nand thirteen in all. The two regular regiments suffered most, losing\r\nfifteen killed and fifty-four wounded. Coffee’s Tennesseeans lost nine\r\nkilled and forty-three wounded. The New Orleans volunteer corps and the\r\ncolored volunteers lost seventeen wounded.\r\n\r\nCompared with the night battle at Lundy’s Lane, the night battle of\r\nDecember 23 was not severe. Brown’s army, probably not more numerous\r\nthan Jackson’s, lost one hundred and seventy-one men killed, while\r\nJackson lost twenty-four. Brown lost five hundred and seventy-one\r\nwounded, while Jackson lost one hundred and fifteen. Drummond at\r\nLundy’s Lane reported a British loss of eighty-four killed, while Keane\r\nreported forty-six. Drummond reported five hundred and fifty-nine\r\nwounded, while Keane reported one hundred and sixty-seven. The total\r\nBritish loss at Lundy’s Lane was eight hundred and seventy-eight men;\r\nthat of December 23 was two hundred and sixty-seven. Jackson’s battle\r\nwas comparatively short, lasting an hour and a half, while the fighting\r\nat Lundy’s Lane continued some five hours. Lundy’s Lane checked the\r\nenemy only for a day or two, and the battle of December 23 could hardly\r\nbe expected to do more.\r\n\r\nConscious that the British army would advance as soon as its main body\r\narrived, Jackson, like Brown, hastened to place his men under cover of\r\nworks. Falling back the next morning about two miles, he took position\r\nbehind an old canal or ditch which crossed the strip of cultivated\r\nground where it was narrowest. The canal offered no serious obstacle to\r\nan enemy, for although ten feet wide it was shallow and dry, and fully\r\nthree quarters of a mile long. Had the British been able to advance in\r\nforce at any time the next day, December 24, directing their attack\r\ntoward the skirts of the swamp to avoid the “Carolina’s” fire, they\r\nmight have forced Jackson back upon New Orleans; but they were in no\r\ndisposition to do on the 24th what they had not ventured to do on the\r\n23d, when they possessed every advantage. Keane believed that Jackson’s\r\nforce in the night battle amounted to five thousand men.[524] Keane’s\r\ntroops, weary, cold, without food, and exposed to the “Carolina’s”\r\nfire, which imprisoned them all day between the two levees,[525] were\r\nglad to escape further attack, and entertained no idea of advance. The\r\nday and night of December 24 were occupied by the British in hurrying\r\nthe main body of their troops from the Isle aux Poix across Lake Borgne\r\nto the Bayou Bienvenu.\r\n\r\nBy very great efforts the boats of the fleet transported the whole\r\nremaining force across the lake, until, on the morning of December 25,\r\nall were concentrated at the Villeré plantation. With them arrived\r\nMajor-General Sir Edward Pakenham, and took command. Hitherto the\r\nfrequent British disasters at Plattsburg, Sackett’s Harbor, Fort Erie,\r\nand the Moravian towns had been attributed to their generals. Sir\r\nGeorge Prevost, Major-Generals Drummond and Riall, and Major-General\r\nProctor were not officers of Wellington’s army. The British government,\r\nin appointing Sir Edward Pakenham to command at New Orleans, meant\r\nto send the ablest officer at their disposal. Pakenham was not only\r\none of Wellington’s best generals, but stood in the close relation\r\nof his brother-in-law, Pakenham’s sister being Wellington’s wife. In\r\nevery military respect Sir Edward Pakenham might consider himself the\r\nsuperior of Andrew Jackson. He was in the prime of life and strength,\r\nthirty-eight years of age, while Jackson, nearly ten years older, was\r\nbroken in health and weak in strength. Pakenham had learned the art of\r\nwar from Wellington, in the best school in Europe. He was supported by\r\nan efficient staff and a military system as perfect as experience and\r\nexpenditure could make it, and he commanded as fine an army as England\r\ncould produce, consisting largely of Peninsula veterans.\r\n\r\nTheir precise number, according to British authority, was five\r\nthousand and forty rank-and-file, on Christmas Day, when Pakenham\r\ntook command.[526] Afterward many more arrived, until January 6, when\r\nten regiments were in camp at Villeré’s plantation,--Royal Artillery;\r\nFourteenth Light Dragoons; Fourth, Seventh, Twenty-first, Forty-third,\r\nForty-fourth, Eighty-fifth, Ninety-third, and Ninety-fifth\r\nInfantry,--numbering, with sappers and miners and staff-corps, five\r\nthousand nine hundred and thirteen rank-and-file; or with a moderate\r\nallowance of officers, an aggregate of at least sixty-five hundred\r\nEuropeans. Two West India regiments of black troops accompanied the\r\nexpedition, numbering ten hundred and forty-three rank-and-file.\r\nThe navy provided about twelve hundred marines and seamen, perhaps\r\nthe most efficient corps in the whole body. Deducting eight hundred\r\nmen for camp-duty, Pakenham, according to British official reports,\r\ncould put in the field a force of eight thousand disciplined troops,\r\nwell-officered, well-equipped, and confident both in themselves and in\r\ntheir commander. More were on their way.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington believed such a force fully competent to\r\ncapture New Orleans, or to rout any American army he ever heard of;\r\nand his confidence would have been, if possible, still stronger, had\r\nhe known his opponent’s resources, which were no greater and not very\r\nmuch better than those so easily overcome by Ross at Bladensburg. The\r\nprincipal difference was that Jackson commanded.\r\n\r\nJackson’s difficulties were very great, and were overcome only by the\r\ndesperate energy which he infused even into the volatile creoles and\r\nsluggish negroes. When he retired from the field of the night battle,\r\nhe withdrew, as has been told, only two miles. About five miles below\r\nNew Orleans he halted his troops. Between the river and the swamp,\r\nthe strip of open and cultivated land was there somewhat narrower than\r\nelsewhere. A space of a thousand yards, or about three fifths of a\r\nmile, alone required strong defence. A shallow, dry canal, or ditch,\r\nten feet wide, crossed the plain and opened into the river on one\r\nside and the swamp on the other. All day the troops, with the negroes\r\nof the neighborhood, worked, deepening the canal, and throwing up a\r\nparapet behind it. The two six-pound field-pieces commanded the road\r\non the river-bank, and the “Louisiana” descended the river to a point\r\nabout two miles below Jackson’s line. A mile below the “Louisiana” the\r\n“Carolina” remained in her old position, opposite the British camp.\r\nBy night-fall the new lines were already formidable, and afforded\r\ncomplete protection from musketry. For further security the parapet\r\nwas continued five hundred yards, and turned well on the flank in the\r\nswamp; but this task was not undertaken until December 28.[527]\r\n\r\nThe first act of Sir Edward Pakenham gave the Americans at least three\r\ndays for preparation. Even veteran soldiers, who were accustomed to\r\nstorming mountain fortresses held by French armies, were annoyed at\r\nexposing their flank to the fire of fifteen or twenty heavy guns,\r\nwhich hampered not only every military movement but also every motion\r\nbeyond cover of the bank. Pakenham sent instantly to the fleet for\r\ncannon to drive the ships away. In reality he could not so relieve\r\nhimself, for the American commodore soon placed one twenty-four-pound\r\ngun and two twelve-pounders in battery on the opposite bank of the\r\nriver, where they answered every purpose of annoyance, while the ships\r\nafter December 28 took little part in action.[528] Pakenham gained\r\nnothing by waiting; but he would not advance without artillery, and\r\nthe sailors, with much labor, brought up a number of light guns,--nine\r\nfield-pieces, it was said,[529] two howitzers, and a mortar. Pakenham\r\npassed two days, December 25 and 26, organizing his force and preparing\r\nthe battery. At daylight, December 27, the guns were ready. Five pieces\r\nsuddenly opened with hot shot and shell on the “Carolina,” and in half\r\nan hour obliged the crew to abandon her.[530] The “Louisiana,” by\r\nextreme exertion, was hauled beyond range while the British battery was\r\noccupied in destroying the “Carolina.”\r\n\r\nNothing then prevented Pakenham’s advance, and the next morning,\r\nDecember 28, the whole army moved forward.\r\n\r\n   “On we went,” said the Subaltern, “for about three miles,\r\n   without any halt or hindrance, either from man or inanimate\r\n   nature coming in our way. But all at once a spectacle was\r\n   presented to us, such indeed as we ought to have looked for, but\r\n   such as manifestly took our leaders by surprise. The enemy’s\r\n   army became visible. It was posted about forty yards in rear of\r\n   a canal, and covered, though most imperfectly, by an unfinished\r\n   breastwork.”\r\n\r\nThe British left, coming under the fire of the “Louisiana,” was\r\nimmediately halted and placed as far as possible under cover. The\r\nskirmishers in the swamp were recalled. In the evening the whole army\r\nwas ordered to retire beyond cannon-shot and hut themselves.[531] They\r\nobeyed; but “there was not a man among us who failed to experience both\r\nshame and indignation.”[532]\r\n\r\nBeyond doubt, such caution was not expected from Sir Edward Pakenham.\r\nSir George Prevost at Sackett’s Harbor and Plattsburg, and Colonel\r\nBrooke at Baltimore had retired before American works; but those works\r\nhad been finished forts, strongly held and situated on elevated points.\r\nEven with such excuses, and after suffering severe losses, Prevost was\r\ndiscredited for his retreats. Pakenham did not live to make a report,\r\nand his reasons remained unavowed; but Admiral Cochrane reported\r\nthat it was “thought necessary to bring heavy artillery against this\r\nwork, and also against the ship which had cannonaded the army when\r\nadvancing.”[533] The decision implied that Pakenham considered the\r\nchances unfavorable for storming the American line.\r\n\r\nIn effect, Pakenham’s withdrawal December 28 was equivalent to\r\nadmitting weakness in his infantry, and to calling on the artillery as\r\nhis strongest arm. The experiment showed little self-confidence. Not\r\nonly must he sacrifice two or three days in establishing batteries, but\r\nhe must challenge a contest with cannon,--weapons which the Americans\r\nwere famous for using, both afloat and ashore, with especial skill.\r\nJackson could also mount heavy guns and allow Pakenham to batter\r\nindefinite lines. Sooner or later Pakenham must storm, unless he could\r\nturn the American position.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Sketch of the Position of the British and American\r\n  Forces\r\n\r\n  NEAR NEW ORLEANS, FROM THE 23rd OF DECEMBER TO THE 8th OF\r\n  JANUARY, 1815.\r\n\r\n  _From original by John Peddie, D.

The Americans also prepared batteries. From\r\nthe lines one thirty-two-pounder, three twenty-four-pounders, and\r\none eighteen-pounder commanded the plain in their front. Besides\r\nthese heavy guns, three twelve-pounders, three six-pounders, a\r\nsix-inch howitzer or mortar, and a brass carronade, useless from its\r\nbad condition,[534]--in all, twelve or thirteen guns, capable of\r\nreplying to the British batteries, were mounted along the American\r\nlines. On the west bank of the river, three quarters of a mile away,\r\nCommodore Patterson established, December 30 and 31, a battery of\r\none twenty-four-pounder and two long twelve-pounders, which took the\r\nBritish batteries in flank.[535] Thus the Americans possessed\r\nfifteen effective guns, six of which were heavy pieces of long\r\nrange. They were worked partly by regular artillerists, partly by\r\nsailors, partly by New Orleans militia, and partly by the “hellish\r\nbanditti” of Barataria, who to the number of twenty or thirty were\r\nreceived by General Jackson into the service and given the care of two\r\ntwenty-four-pounders.\r\n\r\nThe number and position of the British guns were given in Lieutenant\r\nPeddie’s sketch of the field. Before the reconnaissance of December\r\n28, field-pieces had been placed in battery on the river-side to\r\ndestroy the “Carolina” and “Louisiana.” Canon Gleig said that “nine\r\nfield-pieces, two howitzers, and one mortar” were placed in battery\r\non the river-side during the night of December 25.[536] Captain\r\nHenley of the “Carolina” reported that five guns opened upon him on\r\nthe morning of December 26.[537] Captain Peddie’s sketch marked seven\r\npieces mounted in battery on the river-side, bearing on Commodore\r\nPatterson’s battery opposite, besides four pieces in two batteries\r\nbelow. Their range was sufficient to destroy the “Carolina” and pierce\r\nthe breastwork across the river,[538] and therefore they were probably\r\ntwelve and nine pounders.\r\n\r\nBesides these lighter long-range guns, the British constructed three\r\nbatteries in the night of December 31.\r\n\r\n   “Four eighteen-pounders,” reported Major Forrest,[539] British\r\n   assistant-quartermaster-general, “were placed in a battery\r\n   formed of hogsheads of sugar, on the main road, to fire upon\r\n   the ship if she dropped down. Preparations were also made to\r\n   establish batteries,--one of six eighteen-pounders, and one\r\n   of four twenty-four-pound carronades; also batteries for the\r\n   field-pieces and howitzers, the latter to keep the fire of\r\n   the enemy under, while the troops were to be moved forward in\r\n   readiness to storm the works as soon as a practicable breach was\r\n   effected.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Peddie’s sketch the Battery No. 6, on the road or new\r\nlevee, contained not four but two guns. Battery No. 5, some fifty yards\r\nfrom No. 6, contained six guns, as Major Forrest reported. Battery No.\r\n4, to the left of the old levee, contained four guns, probably the\r\ncarronades. Battery No. 3, to the right of the old levee, contained\r\nfive guns, probably the field-pieces and howitzers. In all, seventeen\r\nguns bore on the American lines,--besides seven, in Batteries No. 7 and\r\nNo. 8, bearing on Commodore Patterson’s three-gun battery across the\r\nriver. According to Gleig,[540] the British had thirty guns; but in\r\nany case they used not less than twenty-four guns, throwing a heavier\r\nweight of metal than was thrown by the fifteen pieces used by the\r\nAmericans. The British artillery was served by regular artillerists.\r\n\r\nThese details were particularly interesting, because the artillery\r\nbattle of Jan. 1, 1815, offered the best test furnished during the\r\nwar of relative skill in the use of that arm. The attack had every\r\nadvantage over the defence. The British could concentrate their fire\r\nto effect a breach for their troops to enter; the Americans were\r\nobliged to disperse their fire on eight points. The American platforms\r\nbeing elevated, offered a better target than was afforded by the low\r\nBritish batteries, and certainly were no better protected. Three of\r\nthe American guns were in battery across the river, three quarters of\r\na mile from the main British battery of six eighteen-pounders, while\r\nthe “Louisiana’s” carronades were beyond range, and the “Louisiana”\r\nherself was not brought into action.[541] On the American side the\r\nbattle was fought entirely by the guns in Jackson’s lines and in\r\nPatterson’s battery across the river,--one thirty-two-pounder, four\r\ntwenty-four-pounders, one eighteen-pounder, five twelve-pounders,\r\nthree six-pounders, and a howitzer,--fifteen American guns in all,\r\nmatched against ten British eighteen-pounders, four twenty-four-pound\r\ncarronades, and ten field-pieces and howitzers,--twenty-four guns in\r\nall. If the British field-pieces were twelves and nines, the weight\r\nof metal was at least three hundred and fifty pounds on the British\r\nside against two hundred and twenty-four pounds on the American side,\r\nbesides two howitzers against one.\r\n\r\nThe main British batteries were about seven hundred yards distant from\r\nJackson’s line. Opposite to the battery of six eighteen-pounders were\r\nthe American thirty-two and three twenty-four-pounders. Behind the\r\nBritish batteries the British army waited for the order to assault.\r\nToward eight o’clock on the morning of Jan. 1, 1815, the British opened\r\na hot fire accompanied by a shower of rockets. The American guns\r\nanswered, and the firing continued without intermission until toward\r\nnoon, when the British fire slackened, and at one o’clock the British\r\nartillerists abandoned their batteries, leaving the guns deserted.\r\n\r\nDuring the entire war, no other battle was fought in which the defeated\r\nparty had not some excuse to offer for inferiority. Usually the excuse\r\nascribed greater force to the victor than to the vanquished, or dwelt\r\nupon some accident or oversight which affected the result. For the\r\ndefeat of the British artillery, Jan. 1, 1815, no excuse was ever\r\nsuggested.[542] The British army and navy frankly admitted that the\r\nmisfortune was due to American superiority in the use of artillery.\r\nBritish evidence on that point was ample, for their surprise and\r\nmortification were extreme; while the Americans seemed never fully to\r\nappreciate the extraordinary character of the feat they performed. The\r\nmost detailed British account was also the most outspoken.\r\n\r\n   “Never was any failure more remarkable or unlooked-for than\r\n   this,” said Gleig....[543] “The sun, as if ashamed to shine upon\r\n   our disgrace, was slow of making its appearance; a heavy mist\r\n   obscured him, and the morning was far advanced before it cleared\r\n   away. At last, however, the American lines were visible, and\r\n   then began a fire from our batteries, so brisk and so steadily\r\n   kept up that we who were behind made not the smallest doubt\r\n   of its effect. It was answered for a while faintly, and with\r\n   seeming difficulty. By and by, however, the enemy’s salutation\r\n   became more spirited, till it gradually surpassed our own, both\r\n   in rapidity and precision. We were a good deal alarmed at this,\r\n   and the more that a rumor got abroad that our batteries were not\r\n   proof against the amazing force of the American shot. We had,\r\n   it may be stated, imprudently rolled into the parapets barrels\r\n   filled with sugar, under the impression that sugar would prove\r\n   as effectual as sand in checking the progress of cannon-balls.\r\n   But the event showed that we had been completely mistaken. The\r\n   enemy’s shot penetrated these sugar-hogsheads as if they had\r\n   been so many empty casks, dismounting our guns and killing our\r\n   artillery-men in the very centre of their works. There could be\r\n   small doubt, as soon as these facts were established, how the\r\n   cannonading would end. Our fire slackened every moment; that\r\n   of the Americans became every moment more terrible, till at\r\n   length, after not more than two hours and a half of firing, our\r\n   batteries were all silenced. The American works, on the other\r\n   hand, remained as little injured as ever, and we were completely\r\n   foiled.”\r\n\r\nAdmiral Codrington, writing from the British headquarters three days\r\nafter the battle, expressed equal astonishment and annoyance:[544]--\r\n\r\n   “On the 1st we had our batteries, by severe labor, ready in\r\n   situations from which the artillery people were, as a matter\r\n   of course, to destroy and silence the opposing batteries, and\r\n   give opportunity for a well-arranged storm. But instead of so\r\n   doing, not a gun of the enemy appeared to suffer, and our firing\r\n   too high was not made out until we had expended too much of our\r\n   hardly-collected ammunition to push the matter further. Such a\r\n   failure in this boasted arm was not to be expected, and I think\r\n   it a blot in the artillery escutcheon.”\r\n\r\nCodrington somewhat under-estimated the effect of the British fire.\r\nThree of the American guns, including the thirty-two-pounder, were more\r\nor less damaged, and the cotton-bales which formed the cheeks of the\r\nembrasures proved to be as little serviceable as the hogsheads of sugar\r\nin the British river battery.[545] Two artillery caissons were exploded\r\nby the British rockets. Thirty-four men were killed or wounded; while\r\nthe British reported a loss of seventy-six killed and wounded between\r\nJan. 1 and 5, 1815, most of whom fell in the artillery battle.[546]\r\n\r\nThe British official reports said less, but their silence was equally\r\nsignificant.\r\n\r\n   “Our batteries made little impression upon the enemy’s parapet,”\r\n   wrote Major Forrest.[547] “The order for the assault was\r\n   therefore not carried into effect. The troops remained in this\r\n   advanced position, and orders were given to retire the guns in\r\n   the night. The evening changed to wet, and the ground became in\r\n   consequence so deep that it required the exertions of the whole\r\n   army as a working-party, aided by the seamen, to retire the guns\r\n   a short distance before daylight. The army then fell back to the\r\n   position it occupied on the 31st.”\r\n\r\nAdmiral Cochrane’s official report was still more brief, and best\r\nunderstood by the comments already quoted from his friend Admiral\r\nCodrington:--\r\n\r\n   “On the 1st instant batteries were opened; but our fire not\r\n   having the desired effect, the attack was deferred until the\r\n   arrival of the troops under Major-General Lambert, which was\r\n   daily expected.”\r\n\r\nIf the Subaltern was right, the British defeat resulted in the loss of\r\nseveral guns.\r\n\r\n   “The enemy having made no attempt to carry off our heavy\r\n   guns, which we abandoned to their fate,” continued Gleig, “it\r\n   was judged advisable to bring them into the camp as soon as\r\n   circumstances would allow; and for this purpose working parties\r\n   were again sent out as soon as the darkness screened them. It\r\n   was my fortune to accompany them. The labor of dragging a number\r\n   of huge ship’s guns out of the soft soil into which they had\r\n   sunk, crippled too as most of them were in their carriages, was\r\n   more extreme by far than any one expected to find it. Indeed,\r\n   it was not till four o’clock in the morning that our task came\r\n   to a conclusion, and even then it had been very imperfectly\r\n   performed. Five guns were eventually left behind. These were\r\n   rendered useless, it is true, by breaking their trunnions; but\r\n   it cannot be said that in the course of the late operations the\r\n   British army came off without the loss of some of its artillery.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    PLAN\r\n    OF THE ATTACK AND DEFENCE OF THE\r\n    AMERICAN LINES\r\n\r\n    Below New Orleans, on the 8th January, 1815.\r\n\r\n    By MAJOR A. LACARRIERE LATOUR, principal Engineer 7th\r\n    Military District, U. S. Army, 1815.\r\n\r\n    STRUTHERS & CO., ENGR’S, N. Y.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTUALLY stopped by these repeated miscarriages, General\r\nPakenham, with fully five thousand good soldiers at his command,\r\ndecided to wait an entire week for Major-General Lambert, who was then\r\non his way with two fresh regiments. In the meanwhile Pakenham adopted\r\na suggestion made first by Vice-Admiral Cochrane,[548] to prepare for\r\nthrowing a force across the river to turn Jackson’s line from the\r\nopposite bank. The plan required that the Villeré canal should be\r\nextended through the levee to the river without the knowledge of the\r\nAmericans. Perhaps Pakenham would have done better by dragging his\r\nboats across the intervening space; but he preferred to dig a canal,\r\nand the work, begun January 4, was done so successfully that until\r\nJanuary 6, when it was completed, Jackson did not suspect the movement.\r\nOn the same day Lambert’s division arrived.\r\n\r\nFrom this week of inaction the Americans gained little advantage. The\r\nlines were strengthened; but although the Kentucky reinforcements, more\r\nthan two thousand in number, under General Thomas and John Adair,\r\narrived January 4, they were ill provided with arms, and Jackson\r\ncould furnish them neither with arms, clothing, nor equipment. The\r\nLouisiana militia were in the same condition. Jackson did his utmost\r\nto supply these wants; the people of New Orleans did more, and lent at\r\nlast the few hundred muskets reserved against the danger of a slave\r\ninsurrection,[549] until in the end, if Adair was correct, a thousand\r\nof the Kentuckians were placed in the line of battle. Yet after all the\r\nreinforcements had been mustered, Jackson’s main dependence was still\r\non his artillery and his intrenchments. In the open field he could not\r\nmeet the British force.\r\n\r\nIn his immediate front, Jackson had little to fear. Three thousand\r\nmarksmen, behind intrenchments everywhere at least five feet high,\r\ndefended by heavy guns and supported by the “Louisiana” on the river\r\nand a strong battery on the opposite shore, could defy twice or three\r\ntimes their number advancing across an open plain under fire of eight\r\nor ten heavy guns. The result of the artillery battle of January 1,\r\nas well as the reconnaissance of December 28, showed what the British\r\ngeneral and his staff thought of their chances in a front attack. Twice\r\nthey had refused to attempt it when Jackson’s lines were unfinished;\r\nthey were not likely to succeed when the lines were strengthened by\r\nanother week of labor.\r\n\r\nIn his direct front, therefore, Jackson had reason to think that the\r\nBritish did not intend serious attack. Their next attempt could hardly\r\nfail to be a flanking movement. Jackson had been surprised, December\r\n23, by such a movement, and feared nothing so much as to be surprised\r\nagain. For this reason he still kept a large body of troops, three\r\nregiments of Louisiana militia, on the north of the city.[550] “His\r\ngreatest fear, and hence his strongest defence next to the one occupied\r\nby himself, was on the Chef Menteur road, where Governor Claiborne, at\r\nthe head of the Louisiana militia, was posted.” He kept close watch\r\non the bayous which extended on his immediate flank, and constructed\r\nother lines in his rear to which he could retreat in case his left\r\nflank should be turned through the swamp. Apparently the idea did not\r\noccur to him that the British might more easily turn his right flank by\r\nthrowing a force across the river; and when he learned, January 7, that\r\nthe British were engaged in making this movement, the time had already\r\npassed when he could prevent it.\r\n\r\nNo means had been provided for transporting troops directly from one\r\nbank of the river to the other. If obliged to protect the batteries\r\nestablished by Commodore Patterson on the west bank, Jackson must march\r\ntroops from his lines back five miles to New Orleans, cross them by the\r\nferry, and march them down the other shore. Such a movement required\r\na whole day, and divided the army in a manner hazarding the safety of\r\nboth wings.\r\n\r\nPractically the west bank was undefended when Jackson, January 7, first\r\nheard that the British were about to occupy it. Commodore Patterson had\r\nmounted there, as has been told, a number of heavy guns in battery, but\r\nthese guns were not in position to cover their own bank against attack\r\nfrom below. Major Latour was engaged with negroes in laying out lines\r\nof defence, but nothing was completed. In an advanced position, about\r\na mile below the line of Jackson’s works, a bastion had been raised\r\nclose to the river, and near it a small redan, or salient, had been\r\nconstructed. This work, which was untenable in case of attack in flank\r\nor rear, was occupied by four hundred and fifty Louisiana militia,\r\ncommanded by General David Morgan. During the afternoon of January 7,\r\nafter the British plan of attack was suspected, General Morgan caused\r\nthree guns--one twelve-pounder and two six-pounders--to be mounted on\r\nhis line. Late the same evening General Jackson ordered four hundred\r\nmen of the Kentucky division to New Orleans, where they were to obtain\r\nmuskets, then to cross the river, and march down the opposite shore\r\nto reinforce Morgan. The Kentuckians obeyed their orders, but they\r\nfound only about seventy muskets at New Orleans; and not more than two\r\nhundred and fifty armed men, weary with marching and faint from want\r\nof food, reached Morgan’s quarters at four o’clock on the morning of\r\nJanuary 8.[551] Adair, who should have known the number best, declared\r\nthat only one hundred and seventy men were then in the ranks.[552] They\r\nwere sent a mile farther and stationed as an advanced line, with one\r\nhundred Louisiana militia.\r\n\r\nThus seven or eight hundred tired, ill-armed, and unprotected militia,\r\ndivided in two bodies a mile apart, waited on the west bank to be\r\nattacked by a British column which was then in the act of crossing\r\nthe river. Their defeat was almost certain. A thousand British troops\r\ncould easily drive them away, capture all the batteries on the west\r\nbank, destroy the “Louisiana” as they had destroyed the “Carolina,”\r\nthus turning all Jackson’s lines, and probably rendering necessary\r\nthe evacuation of New Orleans. For this work Pakenham detached the\r\nEighty-fifth regiment, about three hundred strong, the Fifth West\r\nIndia, two hundred seamen and two hundred marines,--about twelve\r\nhundred men in all,[553]--under command of Colonel Thornton, who had\r\nled the light brigade at Bladensburg and across Lake Borgne to the\r\nMississippi. The movement was ordered for the night of January 7, and\r\nwas to be made in boats already collected in the Villeré canal.\r\n\r\nWith some hesitation[554] Pakenham decided to make a simultaneous\r\nattack on Jackson. The arrangements for this assault were simple.\r\nThe usual store of fascines and ladders was provided. Six of the\r\neighteen-pound guns were once more mounted in battery about eight\r\nhundred yards from the American line, to cover the attack. The\r\narmy, after detaching Thornton’s corps, was organized in three\r\ndivisions,--one, under Major-General Gibbs, to attack Jackson’s left;\r\nanother, under Major-General Keane, to attack along the river-side; a\r\nthird, the reserve, to be commanded by Major-General Lambert.\r\n\r\n“The principal attack was to be made by Major-General Gibbs,” said the\r\nBritish official report.[555] The force assigned to Gibbs consisted\r\nof the Fourth, Twenty-first, and Forty-fourth regiments, with three\r\ncompanies of the Ninety-fifth,--about two thousand two hundred\r\nrank-and-file.[556] The force assigned to Keane consisted of “the\r\nNinety-third, two companies of the Ninety-fifth, and two companies of\r\nthe Fusileers and Forty-third,”[557]--apparently about twelve hundred\r\nrank-and-file. “The first brigade, consisting of the Fusileers and\r\nForty-third, formed the reserve” under Major-General Keane, apparently\r\nalso twelve hundred strong. Adding two hundred artillerists and five\r\nhundred black troops of the First West India regiment, employed as\r\nskirmishers along the edge of the swamp, the whole body of troops\r\nengaged on the east bank in the assault, according to the official\r\nreport and returns of wounded,[558] numbered about five thousand three\r\nhundred rank-and-file, consisting of the Fourth, Seventh (Fusileers),\r\nTwenty-first, Forty-third, Forty-fourth, Ninety-third, and Ninety-fifth\r\nregiments, of whom twenty-two hundred were to attack on the right,\r\ntwelve hundred on the left, and twelve hundred were to remain in\r\nreserve.\r\n\r\nThus of the whole British force, some eight thousand rank-and-file,\r\nfifty-three hundred were to assault Jackson’s line; twelve hundred were\r\nto cross the river and assault Morgan; eight hundred and fifty men were\r\ndetailed for various duties; and the seamen, except two hundred with\r\nColonel Thornton, must have been in the boats.\r\n\r\nTo meet this assault, Jackson held an overwhelming force, in which his\r\nmere numbers were the smallest element. According to a detailed account\r\ngiven by Jackson two years afterward, his left wing, near the swamp,\r\nwas held by Coffee’s brigade of eight hundred and four men; his centre,\r\nby Carroll’s brigade of fourteen hundred and fourteen men; his right,\r\nnear the river, by thirteen hundred and twenty-seven men, including all\r\nthe regulars; while Adair’s Kentucky brigade, numbering five hundred\r\nand twenty-five men, were in reserve.[559] Adair claimed that the\r\nKentuckians numbered fully one thousand. The dispute mattered little,\r\nfor barely one third of the entire force, whatever it was, discharged a\r\ngun.\r\n\r\nBesides three thousand or thirty-five hundred men on the parapets\r\nand a thousand in reserve, Jackson had twelve pieces of artillery\r\ndistributed along the line, covering every portion of the plain. The\r\nearth-wall behind which his men rested was in every part sufficiently\r\nhigh to require scaling, and the mud was so slippery as to afford\r\nlittle footing.[560] Patterson’s battery on the opposite shore\r\nincreased in force till it contained three twenty-four-pounders and\r\nsix twelve-pounders,[561] covered the levee by which the British left\r\nmust advance. The “Louisiana” took no part in the action, her men being\r\nengaged in working the guns on shore; but without the “Louisiana’s”\r\nbroadside, Jackson had more than twenty cannon in position. Such a\r\nforce was sufficient to repel ten thousand men if the attack were made\r\nin open day.\r\n\r\nPakenham, aware of the probable consequences of attacking by daylight,\r\narranged for moving before dawn; but his plan required a simultaneous\r\nadvance on both banks of the river, and such a combination was liable\r\nto many accidents. According to the journal of Major Forrest, the\r\nBritish Assistant-Quartermaster-General,[562] forty-seven boats were\r\nbrought up the bayou on the evening of January 7:\r\n\r\n   “As soon as it was dark, the boats commenced to be crossed\r\n   over into the river. A dam erected below the sternmost boat\r\n   had raised the water about two feet. Still there was a very\r\n   considerable fall from the river; and through which, for an\r\n   extent of two hundred and fifty yards, the boats were dragged\r\n   with incredible labor by the seamen. It required the whole\r\n   night to effect this, and the day had dawned before the first\r\n   detachment of Colonel Thornton’s corps (about six hundred men)\r\n   had embarked; and they just reached the opposite bank when the\r\n   main attack commenced on the enemy’s line.”\r\n\r\nAt six o’clock in broad dawn the columns of Gibbs and Keane moved\r\nforward toward Jackson’s works, which were lined with American troops\r\nwaiting for the expected attack. Gibbs’s column came first under\r\nfire, advancing near the swamp in close ranks of about sixty men in\r\nfront.[563] Three of the American batteries opened upon them. Coming\r\nwithin one hundred and fifty yards of the American line, the British\r\ncolumn obliqued to the left to avoid the fire of the battery directly\r\nin face. As they came within musketry range the men faltered and\r\nhalted, beginning a confused musketry fire. A few platoons advanced to\r\nthe edge of the ditch, and then broke. Their officers tried in vain\r\nto rally them for another advance. Major-General Gibbs was mortally\r\nwounded, according to the official report, “within twenty yards of the\r\nglacis.”[564] Pakenham himself rode forward to rally Gibbs’s column,\r\nand was instantly struck by a grape-shot and killed, nearly three\r\nhundred yards from the American line.[565] “As I advanced with the\r\nreserve,” said Lambert’s report, “at about two hundred and fifty yards\r\nfrom the line, I had the mortification to observe the whole falling\r\nback upon me in the greatest confusion.”\r\n\r\nKeane’s column on the left moved along the road and between the river\r\nand the levee. Pressing rapidly forward, greatly annoyed by Patterson’s\r\nbattery on the west bank, the head of this column reached the American\r\nline, and stormed an unfinished redoubt outside the main work at the\r\nedge of the river. The concentrated fire of the whole American right\r\nalmost immediately drove the column back in disorder; the men who\r\nreached the redoubt were killed; Major-General Keane was severely\r\nwounded and carried off the field, while the casualties among officers\r\nof a lower grade were excessive. The Ninety-third regiment in Keane’s\r\nbrigade lost its lieutenant-colonel and two captains killed, and\r\nfour more captains severely wounded; three hundred and forty-eight\r\nrank-and-file were wounded, ninety-nine were reported missing, and\r\nfifty-eight killed. These losses amounted to five hundred and five in\r\nseven hundred and seventy-five rank-and-file.[566]\r\n\r\nLambert’s report continued:[567]--\r\n\r\n   “In this situation, finding that no impression had been made;\r\n   that though many men had reached the ditch, they were either\r\n   drowned or obliged to surrender, and that it was impossible to\r\n   restore order in the regiments where they were,--I placed the\r\n   reserve in position until I could obtain such information as to\r\n   determine me how to act to the best of my judgment, and whether\r\n   or not I should resume the attack; and if so, I felt it could be\r\n   done only by the reserve.”\r\n\r\nJust as the main attack ended, Colonel Thornton with his six hundred\r\nrank-and-file, having landed on the west bank, advanced against\r\nMorgan’s line, routed it, turned the redoubt, and advanced on\r\nPatterson’s heavy battery beyond. Patterson unable to use his guns had\r\nno choice but to spike his pieces and retreat. Thornton passed up the\r\nriver a mile beyond Jackson’s line,[568] and needed only a field-piece\r\nand some hot shot to burn the “Louisiana” and march opposite New\r\nOrleans.\r\n\r\nFrom the eastern shore Jackson watched the progress of Thornton with\r\nalarm. His official report of January 9 gave an idea of his emotions.\r\n\r\n   “Simultaneously with his advance on my lines,” Jackson said,\r\n   “the enemy had thrown over in his boats a considerable force\r\n   to the other side of the river. These having landed were hardy\r\n   enough to advance against the works of General Morgan; and\r\n   what is strange and difficult to account for, at the very\r\n   moment when their entire discomfiture was looked for with a\r\n   confidence approaching to certainty, the Kentucky reinforcements\r\n   ingloriously fled, drawing after them by their example the\r\n   remainder of the forces, and thus yielding to the enemy that\r\n   most formidable position. The batteries which had rendered\r\n   me for many days the most important service, though bravely\r\n   defended, were of course now abandoned, not however until the\r\n   guns had been spiked. This unfortunate rout had totally changed\r\n   the aspect of affairs. The enemy now occupied a position from\r\n   which they might annoy us without hazard, and by means of which\r\n   they might have been enabled to defeat in a great measure the\r\n   effect of our success on this side the river.”\r\n\r\nJohn Adair, who was then in command of the Kentucky brigade, General\r\nThomas being unwell, took great offence at Jackson’s account of the\r\nbattle on the west bank. “The detachment on the other side of the\r\nriver,” he reported to Governor Shelby,[569] “were obliged to retire\r\nbefore a superior force. They have been calumniated by those who\r\nought to have fought with them, but did not.” The tone of Jackson’s\r\nreport, and his language afterward, showed a willingness to load the\r\nKentucky troops on the west bank with the responsibility for a military\r\noversight with which they had nothing to do; but the oversight was not\r\nthe less serious, whoever was responsible for it. The Kentucky and\r\nLouisiana troops did not easily yield. The British returns of killed\r\nand wounded showed that Thornton’s column suffered a considerable\r\nloss. Thornton himself was wounded; his regiment, the Eighty-fifth,\r\nnumbering two hundred and ninetyeight rank-and file, reported a loss\r\nof forty-three men killed, wounded, and missing, besides their colonel.\r\nOf one hundred sailors employed in the attack[570] twenty were killed\r\nor wounded, besides Captain Money of the royal navy, “who, I am sorry\r\nto say, was severely wounded,” said Thornton. The Americans made as\r\ngood a resistance as could have been expected, and had they resisted\r\nlonger they would merely have been captured when the next detachment\r\nof Thornton’s column came up. The chief blame for the disaster did not\r\nrest on them.\r\n\r\nJackson was helpless to interpose. As he and his men, lining the river\r\nbank, watched the progress of Thornton’s column on the opposite shore,\r\nJackson could do nothing; but he ordered his men “that they should take\r\noff their hats, and give our troops on the right bank three cheers.”\r\nAdair, who inclined to a severe judgment of Jackson’s generalship, told\r\nthe story more picturesquely:[571]--\r\n\r\n   “I was standing by him when he gave his order, and with a smile,\r\n   not of approbation, observed I was afraid they could not hear\r\n   us. The distance from us to them, on a straight line, was upward\r\n   of one mile and a half; there was a thick fog, and I confess I\r\n   could not see the troops of either army. All I could discover\r\n   was the blaze from the guns; and seeing that continue to\r\n   progress up the river was the only knowledge we had that our men\r\n   were retreating.”\r\n\r\nJackson then ordered General Humbert, a French officer acting as\r\na volunteer, to take four hundred men and cross the river at New\r\nOrleans to repulse the enemy, cost what it might;[572] but had the\r\nenemy pressed his advantage, no force at Jackson’s command could have\r\nstopped their advance, without causing the sacrifice of Jackson’s\r\nlines. Fortunately the only remaining British general, Lambert, was not\r\ndisposed to make another effort. The eight regiments of regular troops\r\nwhich made the bulk of Pakenham’s army had suffered severely in the\r\nassault. One of these regiments, the Eighty-fifth, was with Thornton\r\non the west shore. Two, the Seventh and Forty-third, had been in the\r\nreserve, and except two companies had never approached the works within\r\nmusket-shot, yet had lost fifty-two killed, and about one hundred\r\nwounded and missing, in an aggregate of less than eighteen hundred.\r\nThe five remaining regiments--the Fourth, Twenty-first, Forty-fourth,\r\nNinety-third, and Ninety-fifth--were nearly destroyed. They went into\r\nbattle probably about three thousand strong:[573] they lost seventeen\r\nhundred and fifty men killed, wounded, and missing. The total British\r\nloss was two thousand and thirty-six.[574] The American loss was\r\nseventy-one. Even on the west bank the American loss was much less than\r\nthat of the British.\r\n\r\nThe loss of three major-generals was almost as serious as the loss of\r\none third of the regular Infantry. Lambert, the fourth major-general,\r\nweighed down by responsibility and defeat, had no wish but to escape.\r\nHe recalled Thornton’s corps the same evening from its position on the\r\nopposite bank, and the next day, January 9, began preparations for his\r\ndifficult and hazardous retreat.[575]\r\n\r\nPakenham’s assault on Jackson’s lines at New Orleans, January 8,\r\nrepeated the assault made by Drummond, August 15, at Fort Erie.\r\nAccording to the British account of that battle, Drummond’s engaged\r\nforce numbered twenty-one hundred and forty men; the reserve, about one\r\nthousand.[576] Drummond’s direct attack, being made by night, was more\r\nsuccessful than Pakenham’s; his troops approached nearer and penetrated\r\nfarther than those of Gibbs and Keane; but the consequences were the\r\nsame. Of three thousand men, Drummond lost nine hundred and five. Of\r\nsix thousand, engaged in the double action of Jan. 8, 1815, Pakenham\r\nlost two thousand and thirty-six. In each case the officers commanding\r\nthe assaulting columns were killed or wounded, and the repulse was\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle General Lambert’s position was critical. His\r\nwithdrawal of Thornton’s corps from the west bank betrayed his\r\nintention of retiring, and his line of retreat was exposed to attack\r\nfrom the bayou which headed near Jackson’s camp. Fortunately for him,\r\nJackson was contented with checking his advance.\r\n\r\n   “Whether, after the severe loss he has sustained,” wrote\r\n   Jackson, five days after the battle,[577] “he is preparing to\r\n   return to his shipping, or to make still mightier efforts to\r\n   attain his first object, I do not pretend to determine. It\r\n   becomes me to act as though the latter were his intention.”\r\n\r\nIf Jackson’s inaction allowed Lambert to escape, it was likely to\r\nhazard a renewal of the attack from some other quarter; but the\r\narmies remained for ten days in their old positions without further\r\nhostilities, except from artillery fire, until on the night of January\r\n18, after making careful preparations, the whole British force silently\r\nwithdrew to fortified positions at the mouth of the bayou, disappearing\r\nas suddenly and mysteriously as it came, and leaving behind it\r\nonly eight or, according to the American report, fourteen[578] of\r\nthe guns which had covered the river and held the “Louisiana” at a\r\ndistance.[579] At the mouth of the bayou the army remained until\r\nJanuary 27, when it was re-embarked in the ships off Chandeleur’s\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    MOBILE POINT\r\n\r\n    FROM ORIGINAL BY\r\n\r\n    TH. CAMPBELL, LIEUT. ROYAL STAFF CORPS.\r\n\r\n    _British Archives._]\r\n\r\nOn the day of the battle of January 8, a British squadron appeared\r\nin the river below Fort St. Philip. Two bomb-vessels, under the\r\nprotection of a sloop, a brig, and a schooner, bombarded the fort\r\nwithout effect until January 18, when they withdrew at the same time\r\nwith the army above.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the disastrous failure of the campaign before New\r\nOrleans, the British expedition, as it lay off Chandeleur Island\r\nFebruary 1, still possessed nearly as much strength as when it appeared\r\nthere December 11. Reinforced by a thousand fresh soldiers, Lambert\r\ndetermined to attack Mobile. “It was decided,” reported Lambert,[580]\r\n“that a force should be sent against Fort Bowyer, situated on the\r\neastern point of the entrance of the bay, and from every information\r\nthat could be obtained it was considered that a brigade would be\r\nsufficient for this object, with a respectable force of artillery.”\r\nAt daylight on the morning of February 8 a whole brigade and a heavy\r\nbattering-train were disembarked in the rear of Fort Bowyer.\r\n\r\nJackson’s determination to defend Mobile had already deprived him of\r\nthe use of more than half the regular troops assigned to his military\r\ndistrict, who remained inactive at Mobile during the months of December\r\nand January. They were commanded by General Winchester, whose record\r\nas a military officer was not reassuring. Although Fort Bowyer was\r\nknown to be untenable against attack by land, Jackson not only retained\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Lawrence there, but increased his force until he\r\nhad three hundred and sixty men in his command,--equal to the average\r\nstrength of an entire regiment, or half the force of regulars which\r\nJackson commanded at New Orleans. This garrison was only large enough\r\nto attract, not to repel, an enemy. The obvious criticism on such a\r\ncourse was afterward made by Armstrong:[581]--\r\n\r\n   “After the arrival of the British armament the garrison of Fort\r\n   Bowyer was not only continued but increased, though from its\r\n   locality wholly unable to aid in any important purpose of the\r\n   campaign. Nor was this the whole extent of the evil, for by the\r\n   disposition made of this gallant corps it was not only subjected\r\n   to present inaction, but ultimately ... to the perils of a siege\r\n   and the humiliation of a surrender.”\r\n\r\nColonel Lawrence had no choice but to capitulate, which he did February\r\n11. He had not even the opportunity to resist, for the British made\r\nregular approaches, and could not be prevented from capturing the place\r\nwithout the necessity of assault. Jackson reported to the Secretary of\r\nWar[582] that this event was one which he “little expected to happen\r\nbut after the most gallant resistance; that it should have taken place\r\nwithout even a fire from the enemy’s batteries is as astonishing as it\r\nis mortifying.” In truth, the military arrangements, not Lawrence’s\r\ndefence, were responsible for the result; and Jackson had reason to\r\nfear that a greater disaster was at hand, for unless General Winchester\r\nshould promptly evacuate Mobile, the disaster of the River Raisin was\r\nlikely to be repeated on a larger scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            END OF VOL.
