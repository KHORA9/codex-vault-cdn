MARTIN'S STREET, LONDON\r\n  1920\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHT\r\n\r\n_First Edition_ 1887. _Second Edition_ 1890.\r\n\r\n_Reprinted_ 1893, 1894, 1896, 1898, 1901, 1903, 1907, 1910, 1913, 1918,\r\n1920.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO NINTH EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nAs was explained in the Note to the Preface of the previous editions and\r\nimpressions of this book, after the first, hardly one of them appeared\r\nwithout careful revision, and the insertion of a more or less considerable\r\nnumber of additions and corrections. I found, indeed, few errors of a kind\r\nthat need have seemed serious except to Momus or Zoilus. But in the\r\nenormous number of statements of fact which literary history of the more\r\nexact kind requires, minor blunders, be they more or fewer, are sure to\r\ncreep in. No writer, again, who endeavours constantly to keep up and extend\r\nhis knowledge of such a subject as Elizabethan literature, can fail to have\r\nsomething new to say from time to time. And though no one who is competent\r\noriginally for his task ought to experience any violent changes of view,\r\nany one's views may undergo modification. In particular, he may find that\r\nreaders have misunderstood him, and that alterations of expression are\r\ndesirable. For all these reasons and others I have not spared trouble in\r\nthe various revisions referred to; I think the book has been kept by them\r\nfairly abreast of its author's knowledge, and I hope it is not too far\r\nbehind that of others.\r\n\r\nIt will, however, almost inevitably happen that a long series of piecemeal\r\ncorrections and codicils somewhat disfigures the character of the\r\ncomposition as a whole. And after nearly the full score of years, and not\r\nmuch less than half a score of re-appearances, it has seemed to me\r\ndesirable to make a somewhat more thorough, minute, and above all connected\r\nrevision than I have ever made before. And so, my publishers falling in\r\nwith this view, the present edition represents the result. I do not think\r\nit necessary to reprint the original preface. When I wrote it I had already\r\nhad some, and since I wrote it I have had much more, experience in writing\r\nliterary history. I have never seen reason to alter the opinion that, to\r\nmake such history of any value at all, the critical judgments and\r\ndescriptions must represent direct, original, and first-hand reading and\r\nthought; and that in these critical judgments and descriptions the value of\r\nit consists. Even summaries and analyses of the matter of books, except in\r\nso far as they are necessary to criticism, come far second; while\r\nbiographical and bibliographical details are of much less importance, and\r\nmay (as indeed in one way or another they generally must) be taken at\r\nsecond hand. The completion of the _Dictionary of National Biography_ has\r\nat once facilitated the task of the writer, and to a great extent disarmed\r\nthe candid critic who delights, in cases of disputed date, to assume that\r\nthe date which his author chooses is the wrong one. And I have in the main\r\nadjusted the dates in this book (where necessary) accordingly. The\r\nbibliographical additions which have been made to the Index will be found\r\nnot inconsiderable.\r\n\r\nI believe that, in my present plan, there is no author of importance\r\nomitted (there were not many even in the first edition), and that I have\r\nbeen able somewhat to improve the book from the results of twenty years'\r\nadditional study, twelve of which have been mainly devoted to English\r\nliterature. How far it must still be from being worthy of its subject,\r\nnobody can know better than I do. But I know also, and I am very happy to\r\nknow, that, as an Elizabethan himself might have said, my unworthiness has\r\nguided many worthy ones to something like knowledge, and to what is more\r\nimportant than knowledge, love, of a subject so fascinating and so\r\nmagnificent. And that the book may still have the chance of doing this, I\r\nhope to spare no trouble upon it as often as the opportunity presents\r\nitself.[1]\r\n\r\n  EDINBURGH, _January_ 30, 1907.\r\n\r\n[1] In the last (eleventh) re-impression no alterations seemed necessary.\r\nIn this, one or two bibliographical matters may call for notice. Every\r\nstudent of Donne should now consult Professor Grierson's edition of the\r\n_Poems_ (2 vols., Oxford, 1912), and as inquiries have been made as to the\r\nthird volume of my own _Caroline Poets_ (see Index), containing Cleveland,\r\nKing, Stanley, and some less known authors, I may be permitted to say that\r\nit has been in the press for years, and a large part of it is completed.\r\nBut various stoppages, in no case due to neglect, and latterly made\r\nabsolute by the war, have prevented its appearance.--BATH, October 8, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n

and preceded by\r\nanother part, the writer has the advantage of being almost wholly free from\r\na difficulty which often presses on historians of a limited and definite\r\nperiod, whether of literary or of any other history. That difficulty lies\r\nin the discussion and decision of the question of origins--in the allotment\r\nof sufficient, and not more than sufficient, space to a preliminary\r\nrecapitulation of the causes and circumstances of the actual events to be\r\nrelated. Here there is no need for any but the very briefest references of\r\nthe kind to connect the present volume with its forerunner, or rather to\r\nindicate the connection of the two.\r\n\r\nThere has been little difference of opinion as to the long dead-season of\r\nEnglish poetry, broken chiefly, if not wholly, by poets Scottish rather\r\nthan English, which lasted through almost the whole of the fifteenth and\r\nthe first half of the sixteenth centuries. There has also been little\r\ndifference in regarding the remarkable work (known as Tottel's\r\n_Miscellany_, but more properly called _Songs and Sonnets, written by the\r\nRight Honourable Lord Henry Howard, late Earl of Surrey, and other_) which\r\nwas published by Richard Tottel in 1557, and which went through two\r\neditions in the summer of that year, as marking the dawn of the new\r\nperiod. The book is, indeed, remarkable in many ways. The first thing,\r\nprobably, which strikes the modern reader about it is the fact that great\r\npart of its contents is anonymous and only conjecturally to be attributed,\r\nwhile as to the part which is more certainly known to be the work of\r\nseveral authors, most of those authors were either dead or had written long\r\nbefore. Mr. Arber's remarks in his introduction (which, though I have\r\nrather an objection to putting mere citations before the public, I am glad\r\nhere to quote as a testimony in the forefront of this book to the excellent\r\ndeserts of one who by himself has done as much as any living man to\r\nfacilitate the study of Elizabethan literature) are entirely to the\r\npoint--how entirely to the point only students of foreign as well as of\r\nEnglish literature know. \"The poets of that age,\" says Mr. Arber, \"wrote\r\nfor their own delectation and for that of their friends, and not for the\r\ngeneral public. They generally had the greatest aversion to their works\r\nappearing in print.\" This aversion, which continued in France till the end\r\nof the seventeenth century, if not later, had been somewhat broken down in\r\nEngland by the middle of the sixteenth, though vestiges of it long\r\nsurvived, and in the form of a reluctance to be known to write for money,\r\nmay be found even within the confines of the nineteenth. The humbler means\r\nand lesser public of the English booksellers have saved English literature\r\nfrom the bewildering multitude of pirated editions, printed from private\r\nand not always faithful manuscript copies, which were for so long the\r\ndespair of the editors of many French classics. But the manuscript copies\r\nthemselves survive to a certain extent, and in the more sumptuous and\r\nelaborate editions of our poets (such as, for instance, Dr. Grosart's\r\n_Donne_) what they have yielded may be studied with some interest.\r\nMoreover, they have occasionally preserved for us work nowhere else to be\r\nobtained, as, for instance, in the remarkable folio which has supplied Mr.\r\nBullen with so much of his invaluable collection of Old Plays. At the early\r\nperiod of Tottel's _Miscellany_ it would appear that the very idea of\r\npublication in print had hardly occurred to many writers' minds. When the\r\nbook appeared, both its main contributors, Surrey and Wyatt, had been long\r\ndead, as well as others (Sir Francis Bryan and Anne Boleyn's unlucky\r\nbrother, George Lord Rochford) who are supposed to be represented. The\r\nshort Printer's Address to the Reader gives absolutely no intelligence as\r\nto the circumstances of the publication, the person responsible for the\r\nediting, or the authority which the editor and printer may have had for\r\ntheir inclusion of different authors' work. It is only a theory, though a\r\nsufficiently plausible one, that the editor was Nicholas Grimald, chaplain\r\nto Bishop Thirlby of Ely, a Cambridge man who some ten years before had\r\nbeen incorporated at Oxford and had been elected to a Fellowship at Merton\r\nCollege. In Grimald's or Grimoald's connection with the book there was\r\ncertainly something peculiar, for the first edition contains forty poems\r\ncontributed by him and signed with his name, while in the second the full\r\nname is replaced by \"N. G.,\" and a considerable number of his poems give\r\nway to others. More than one construction might, no doubt, be placed on\r\nthis curious fact; but hardly any construction can be placed on it which\r\ndoes not in some way connect Grimald with the publication. It may be added\r\nthat, while his, Surrey's, and Wyatt's contributions are substantive and\r\nknown--the numbers of separate poems contributed being respectively forty\r\nfor Surrey, the same for Grimald, and ninety-six for Wyatt--no less than\r\none hundred and thirty-four poems, reckoning the contents of the first and\r\nsecond editions together, are attributed to \"other\" or \"uncertain\" authors.\r\nAnd of these, though it is pretty positively known that certain writers did\r\ncontribute to the book, only four poems have been even conjecturally traced\r\nto particular authors. The most interesting of these by far is the poem\r\nattributed, with that which immediately precedes it, to Lord Vaux, and\r\ncontaining the verses \"For age with stealing steps,\" known to every one\r\nfrom the gravedigger in _Hamlet_. Nor is this the only connection of\r\nTottel's _Miscellany_ with Shakespere, for there is no reasonable doubt\r\nthat the \"Book of Songs and Sonnets,\" to the absence of which Slender so\r\npathetically refers in _The Merry Wives of Windsor_, is Tottel's, which, as\r\nthe first to use the title, long retained it by right of precedence.\r\nIndeed, one of its authors, Churchyard, who, though not in his first youth\r\nat its appearance, survived into the reign of James, quotes it as such, and\r\nso does Drayton even later. No sonnets had been seen in England before, nor\r\nwas the whole style of the verse which it contained less novel than this\r\nparticular form.\r\n\r\nAs is the case with many if not most of the authors of our period, a rather\r\nunnecessary amount of ink has been spilt on questions very distantly\r\nconnected with the question of the absolute and relative merit of Surrey\r\nand Wyatt in English poetry. In particular, the influence of the one poet\r\non the other, and the consequent degree of originality to be assigned to\r\neach, have been much discussed. A very few dates and facts will supply most\r\nof the information necessary to enable the reader to decide this and other\r\nquestions for himself. Sir Thomas Wyatt, son of Sir Henry Wyatt of\r\nAllington, Kent, was born in 1503, entered St. John's College, Cambridge,\r\nin 1515, became a favourite of Henry VIII., received important diplomatic\r\nappointments, and died in 1542. Lord Henry Howard was born (as is supposed)\r\nin 1517, and became Earl of Surrey by courtesy (he was not, the account of\r\nhis judicial murder says, a lord of Parliament) at eight years old. Very\r\nlittle is really known of his life, and his love for \"Geraldine\" was made\r\nthe basis of a series of fictions by Nash half a century after his death.\r\nHe cannot have been more than thirty when, in the Reign of Terror towards\r\nthe close of Henry VIII.'s life, he was arrested on frivolous charges, the\r\ngravest being the assumption of the royal arms, found guilty of treason,\r\nand beheaded on Tower Hill on 19th January 1547. Thus it will be seen that\r\nWyatt was at Cambridge before Surrey was born, and died five years before\r\nhim; to which it need only be added that Surrey has an epitaph on Wyatt\r\nwhich clearly expresses the relation of disciple to master. Yet despite\r\nthis relation and the community of influences which acted on both, their\r\ncharacteristics are markedly different, and each is of the greatest\r\nimportance in English poetical history.\r\n\r\nIn order to appreciate exactly what this importance is we must remember in\r\nwhat state Wyatt and Surrey found the art which they practised and in which\r\nthey made a new start. Speaking roughly but with sufficient accuracy for\r\nthe purpose, that state is typically exhibited in two writers, Hawes and\r\nSkelton. The former represents the last phase of the Chaucerian school,\r\nweakened not merely by the absence of men of great talent during more than\r\na century, but by the continual imitation during that period of weaker and\r\never weaker French models--the last faint echoes of the _Roman de la Rose_\r\nand the first extravagances of the _Rhetoriqueurs_. Skelton, on the other\r\nhand, with all his vigour, represents the English tendency to prosaic\r\ndoggerel. Whether Wyatt and his younger companion deliberately had recourse\r\nto Italian example in order to avoid these two dangers it would be\r\nimpossible to say. But the example was evidently before them, and the\r\nresult is certainly such an avoidance. Nevertheless both, and especially\r\nWyatt, had a great deal to learn. It is perfectly evident that neither had\r\nany theory of English prosody before him. Wyatt's first sonnet displays the\r\ncompletest indifference to quantity, not merely scanning \"harber,\"\r\n\"banner,\" and \"suffer\" as iambs (which might admit of some defence), but\r\nmaking a rhyme of \"feareth\" and \"appeareth,\" not on the penultimates, but\r\non the mere \"eth.\" In the following poems even worse liberties are found,\r\nand the strange turns and twists which the poet gives to his decasyllables\r\nsuggest either a total want of ear or such a study in foreign languages\r\nthat the student had actually forgotten the intonation and cadences of his\r\nown tongue. So stumbling and knock-kneed is his verse that any one who\r\nremembers the admirable versification of Chaucer may now and then be\r\ninclined to think that Wyatt had much better have left his innovations\r\nalone. But this petulance is soon rebuked by the appearance of such a\r\nsonnet as this:--\r\n\r\n    (_The lover having dreamed enjoying of his love complaineth that the_\r\n          _dream is not either longer or truer._)\r\n\r\n    \"Unstable dream, according to the place\r\n      Be steadfast once, or else at least be true.\r\n      By tasted sweetness, make me not to rue\r\n    The sudden loss of thy false feigned grace.\r\n    By good respect in such a dangerous case\r\n      Thou brought'st not her into these tossing seas\r\n      But mad'st my sprite to live, my care to increase,[2]\r\n    My body in tempest her delight to embrace.\r\n    The body dead, the sprite had his desire:\r\n      Painless was th' one, the other in delight.\r\n      Why then, alas! did it not keep it right,\r\n    But thus return to leap into the fire?\r\n    And where it was at wish, could not remain?\r\n    Such mocks of dreams do turn to deadly pain.\"\r\n\r\n[2] In original \"tencrease,\" and below \"timbrace.\" This substitution of\r\nelision for slur or hiatus (found in Chaucerian MSS.) passed later into the\r\nt' and th' of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nWyatt's awkwardness is not limited to the decasyllable, but some of his\r\nshort poems in short lines recover rhythmical grace very remarkably, and\r\nset a great example.\r\n\r\nSurrey is a far superior metrist. Neither in his sonnets, nor in his\r\nvarious stanzas composed of heroics, nor in what may be called his doggerel\r\nmetres--the fatally fluent Alexandrines, fourteeners, and admixtures of\r\nboth, which dominated English poetry from his time to Spenser's, and were\r\nnever quite rejected during the Elizabethan period--do we find evidence of\r\nthe want of ear, or the want of command of language, which makes Wyatt's\r\nversification frequently disgusting. Surrey has even no small mastery of\r\nwhat may be called the architecture of verse, the valuing of cadence in\r\nsuccessive lines so as to produce a concerted piece and not a mere\r\nreduplication of the same notes. And in his translations of the _AEneid_\r\n(not published in Tottel's _Miscellany_) he has the great honour of being\r\nthe originator of blank verse, and blank verse of by no means a bad\r\npattern. The following sonnet, combined Alexandrine and fourteener, and\r\nblank verse extract, may be useful:--\r\n\r\n    (_Complaint that his lady after she knew of his love kept her face_\r\n          _alway hidden from him._)\r\n\r\n    \"I never saw my lady lay apart\r\n    Her cornet black, in cold nor yet in heat,\r\n    Sith first she knew my grief was grown so great;\r\n    Which other fancies driveth from my heart,\r\n    That to myself I do the thought reserve,\r\n    The which unwares did wound my woeful breast.\r\n    But on her face mine eyes mought never rest\r\n    Yet, since she knew I did her love, and serve\r\n    Her golden tresses clad alway with black,\r\n    Her smiling looks that hid[es] thus evermore\r\n    And that restrains which I desire so sore.\r\n    So doth this cornet govern me, alack!\r\n    In summer sun, in winter's breath, a frost\r\n    Whereby the lights of her fair looks I lost.\"[3]\r\n\r\n[3] As printed exactly in both first and second editions this sonnet is\r\nevidently corrupt, and the variations between the two are additional\r\nevidence of this. I have ventured to change \"hid\" to \"hides\" in line 10,\r\nand to alter the punctuation in line 13. If the reader takes \"that\" in line\r\n5 as = \"so that,\" \"that\" in line 10 as = \"which\" (_i.e._ \"black\"), and\r\n\"that\" in line 11 with \"which,\" he will now, I think, find it intelligible.\r\nLine 13 is usually printed:\r\n\r\n    \"In summer, sun: in winter's breath, a frost.\"\r\n\r\nNow no one would compare a black silk hood to the sun, and a reference to\r\nline 2 will show the real meaning. The hood is a frost which lasts through\r\nsummer and winter alike.\r\n\r\n    (_Complaint of the absence of her lover being upon the sea._)\r\n\r\n      \"Good ladies, ye that have your pleasures in exile,\r\n    Step in your foot, come take a place, and mourn with me a while.\r\n      And such as by their lords do set but little price,\r\n    Let them sit still: it skills them not what chance come on the dice.\r\n      But ye whom love hath bound by order of desire,\r\n    To love your lords whose good deserts none other would require,\r\n      Come ye yet once again and set your foot by mine,\r\n    Whose woeful plight and sorrows great, no tongue can well define.\"[4]\r\n\r\n[4] In reading these combinations it must be remembered that there is\r\nalways a strong caesura in the midst of the first and Alexandrine line. It\r\nis the Alexandrine which Mr. Browning has imitated in _Fifine_, not that of\r\nDrayton, or of the various practitioners of the Spenserian stanza from\r\nSpenser himself downwards.\r\n\r\n    \"It was the(n)[5] night; the sound and quiet sleep\r\n    Had through the earth the weary bodies caught,\r\n    The woods, the raging seas, were fallen to rest,\r\n    When that the stars had half their course declined.\r\n    The fields whist: beasts and fowls of divers hue,\r\n    And what so that in the broad lakes remained,\r\n    Or yet among the bushy thicks[6] of briar,\r\n    Laid down to sleep by silence of the night,\r\n    'Gan swage their cares, mindless of travails past.\r\n    Not so the spirit of this Phenician.\r\n    Unhappy she that on no sleep could chance,\r\n    Nor yet night's rest enter in eye or breast.\r\n    Her cares redouble: love doth rise and rage again,[7]\r\n    And overflows with swelling storms of wrath.\"\r\n\r\n[5] In these extracts () signifies that something found in text seems\r\nbetter away; [] that something wanting in text has been conjecturally\r\nsupplied.\r\n\r\n[6] Thickets.\r\n\r\n[7] This Alexandrine is not common, and is probably a mere oversight.\r\n\r\nThe \"other\" or \"uncertain\" authors, though interesting enough for purposes\r\nof literary comparison, are very inferior to Wyatt and Surrey. Grimald, the\r\nsupposed editor, though his verse must not, of course, be judged with\r\nreference to a more advanced state of things than his own, is but a\r\njourneyman verse-smith.\r\n\r\n    \"Sith, Blackwood, you have mind to take a wife,\r\n    I pray you tell wherefore you like that life,\"\r\n\r\nis a kind of foretaste of Crabbe in its bland ignoring of the formal graces\r\nof poetry. He acquits himself tolerably in the combinations of Alexandrines\r\nand fourteeners noticed above (the \"poulter's measure,\" as Gascoigne was to\r\ncall it later), nor does he ever fall into the worst kind of jog-trot. His\r\nepitaphs and elegies are his best work, and the best of them is that on his\r\nmother. Very much the same may be said of the strictly miscellaneous part\r\nof the _Miscellany_. The greater part of the Uncertain Authors are less\r\nambitious, but also less irregular than Wyatt, while they fall far short of\r\nSurrey in every respect. Sometimes, as in the famous \"I loath that I did\r\nlove,\" both syntax and prosody hardly show the reform at all; they recall\r\nthe ruder snatches of an earlier time. But, on the whole, the\r\ncharacteristics of these poets, both in matter and form, are sufficiently\r\nuniform and sufficiently interesting. Metrically, they show, on the one\r\nside, a desire to use a rejuvenated heroic, either in couplets or in\r\nvarious combined forms, the simplest of which is the elegiac quatrain of\r\nalternately rhyming lines, and the most complicated the sonnet; while\r\nbetween them various stanzas more or less suggested by Italian are to be\r\nranked. Of this thing there has been and will be no end as long as English\r\npoetry lasts. The attempt to arrange the old and apparently almost\r\nindigenous \"eights and sixes\" into fourteener lines and into alternate\r\nfourteeners and Alexandrines, seems to have commended itself even more to\r\ncontemporary taste, and, as we have seen and shall see, it was eagerly\r\nfollowed for more than half a century. But it was not destined to succeed.\r\nThese long lines, unless very sparingly used, or with the ground-foot\r\nchanged from the iambus to the anapaest or the trochee, are not in keeping\r\nwith the genius of English poetry, as even the great examples of Chapman's\r\n_Homer_ and the _Polyolbion_ may be said to have shown once for all. In the\r\nhands, moreover, of the poets of this particular time, whether they were\r\nprinted at length or cut up into eights and sixes, they had an almost\r\nirresistible tendency to degenerate into a kind of lolloping amble which is\r\ninexpressibly monotonous. Even when the spur of a really poetical\r\ninspiration excites this amble into something more fiery (the best example\r\nexisting is probably Southwell's wonderful \"Burning Babe\"), the sensitive\r\near feels that there is constant danger of a relapse, and at the worst the\r\nthing becomes mere doggerel. Yet for about a quarter of a century these\r\novergrown lines held the field in verse and drama alike, and the\r\nencouragement of them must be counted as a certain drawback to the benefits\r\nwhich Surrey, Wyatt, and the other contributors of the _Miscellany_\r\nconferred on English literature by their exercises, here and elsewhere, in\r\nthe blank verse decasyllable, the couplet, the stanza, and, above all, the\r\nsonnet.\r\n\r\nIt remains to say something of the matter as distinguished from the form of\r\nthis poetry, and for once the form is of hardly superior importance to the\r\nmatter. It is a question of some interest, though unfortunately one wholly\r\nincapable of solution, whether the change in the character of poetical\r\nthought and theme which Wyatt and Surrey wrought was accidental, and\r\nconsequent merely on their choice of models, and especially of Petrarch, or\r\nessential and deliberate. If it was accidental, there is no greater\r\naccident in the history of literature. The absence of the personal note in\r\nmediaeval poetry is a commonplace, and nowhere had that absence been more\r\nmarked than in England. With Wyatt and Surrey English poetry became at a\r\nbound the most personal (and in a rather bad but unavoidable word) the most\r\n\"introspective\" in Europe. There had of course been love poetry before, but\r\nits convention had been a convention of impersonality. It now became\r\nexactly the reverse. The lover sang less his joys than his sorrows, and he\r\ntried to express those sorrows and their effect on him in the most personal\r\nway he could. Although allegory still retained a strong hold on the\r\nnational taste, and was yet to receive its greatest poetical expression in\r\n_The Faerie Queene_, it was allegory of quite a different kind from that\r\nwhich in the _Roman de la Rose_ had taken Europe captive, and had since\r\ndominated European poetry in all departments, and especially in the\r\ndepartment of love-making. \"Dangier\" and his fellow-phantoms fled before\r\nthe dawn of the new poetry in England, and the depressing influences of a\r\ncommon form--a conventional stock of images, personages, and almost\r\nlanguage--disappeared. No doubt there was conventionality enough in the\r\nfollowing of the Petrarchian model, but it was a less stiff and uniform\r\nconventionality; it allowed and indeed invited the individual to wear his\r\nrue with a difference, and to avail himself at least of the almost infinite\r\ndiversity of circumstance and feeling which the life of the actual man\r\naffords, instead of reducing everything to the moods and forms of an\r\nalready generalised and allegorised experience. With the new theme to\r\nhandle and the new forms ready as tools for the handler, with the general\r\nferment of European spirits, it might readily have been supposed that a\r\nremarkable out-turn of work would be the certain and immediate result.\r\n\r\nThe result in fact may have been certain but it was not immediate, being\r\ndelayed for nearly a quarter of a century; and the next remarkable piece of\r\nwork done in English poetry after Tottel's _Miscellany_--a piece of work of\r\ngreater actual poetical merit than anything in that _Miscellany_\r\nitself--was in the old forms, and showed little if any influence of the new\r\npoetical learning. This was the famous _Mirror for Magistrates_, or rather\r\nthat part of it contributed by Thomas Sackville, Lord Buckhurst. _The\r\nMirror_ as a whole has bibliographical and prosodic rather than literary\r\ninterest. It was certainly planned as early as 1555 by way of a supplement\r\nto Lydgate's translation of Boccaccio's _Fall of Princes_. It was at first\r\nedited by a certain William Baldwin, and for nearly half a century it\r\nreceived additions and alterations from various respectable hacks of\r\nletters; but the \"Induction\" and the \"Complaint of Buckingham\" which\r\nSackville furnished to it in 1559, though they were not published till four\r\nyears later, completely outweigh all the rest in value. To my own fancy the\r\nfact that Sackville was (in what proportion is disputed) also author of\r\n_Gorboduc_ (see Chapter III.) adds but little to its interest. His\r\ncontributions to _The Mirror for Magistrates_ contain the best poetry\r\nwritten in the English language between Chaucer and Spenser, and are most\r\ncertainly the originals or at least the models of some of Spenser's finest\r\nwork. He has had but faint praise of late years. According to the late\r\nProfessor Minto, he \"affords abundant traces of the influence of Wyatt and\r\nSurrey.\" I do not know what the traces are, and I should say myself that\r\nfew contemporary or nearly contemporary efforts are more distinct. Dean\r\nChurch says that we see in him a faint anticipation of Spenser. My estimate\r\nof Spenser, as I hope to show, is not below that of any living critic; but\r\nconsiderations of bulk being allowed, and it being fully granted that\r\nSackville had nothing like Spenser's magnificent range, I cannot see any\r\n\"faintness\" in the case. If the \"Induction\" had not been written it is at\r\nleast possible that the \"Cave of Despair\" would never have enriched English\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\nThomas Sackville was born at Buckhurst in Sussex, in the year 1536, of a\r\nfamily which was of the most ancient extraction and the most honourable\r\nstanding. He was educated at Oxford, at the now extinct Hart Hall, whence,\r\naccording to a practice as common then as it is uncommon now (except in the\r\ncases of royal princes and a few persons of difficult and inconstant\r\ntaste), he moved to Cambridge. Then he entered the Inner Temple, married\r\nearly, travelled, became noted in literature, was made Lord Buckhurst at\r\nthe age of thirty-one, was for many years one of Elizabeth's chief\r\ncouncillors and officers, was promoted to the Earldom of Dorset at the\r\naccession of James I., and died, it is said, at the Council table on the\r\n19th of April 1608.\r\n\r\nWe shall deal with _Gorboduc_ hereafter: the two contributions to _The\r\nMirror for Magistrates_ concern us here. And I have little hesitation in\r\nsaying that no more astonishing contribution to English poetry, when the\r\ndue reservations of that historical criticism which is the life of all\r\ncriticism are made, is to be found anywhere. The bulk is not great: twelve\r\nor fifteen hundred lines must cover the whole of it. The form is not new,\r\nbeing merely the seven-line stanza already familiar in Chaucer. The\r\narrangement is in no way novel, combining as it does the allegorical\r\npresentment of embodied virtues, vices, and qualities with the melancholy\r\nnarrative common in poets for many years before. But the poetical value of\r\nthe whole is extraordinary. The two constituents of that value, the formal\r\nand the material, are represented with a singular equality of development.\r\nThere is nothing here of Wyatt's floundering prosody, nothing of the\r\nwell-intentioned doggerel in which Surrey himself indulges and in which his\r\npupils simply revel. The cadences of the verse are perfect, the imagery\r\nfresh and sharp, the presentation of nature singularly original, when it is\r\ncompared with the battered copies of the poets with whom Sackville must\r\nhave been most familiar, the followers of Chaucer from Occleve to Hawes.\r\nEven the general plan of the poem--the weakest part of nearly all poems of\r\nthis time--is extraordinarily effective and makes one sincerely sorry that\r\nSackville's taste, or his other occupations, did not permit him to carry\r\nout the whole scheme on his own account. The \"Induction,\" in which the\r\nauthor is brought face to face with Sorrow, and the central passages of the\r\n\"Complaint of Buckingham,\" have a depth and fulness of poetical sound and\r\nsense for which we must look backwards a hundred and fifty years, or\r\nforwards nearly five and twenty. Take, for instance, these stanzas:--\r\n\r\n    \"Thence come we to the horror and the hell,\r\n    The large great kingdoms, and the dreadful reign\r\n    Of Pluto in his throne where he did dwell,\r\n    The wide waste places, and the hugy plain,\r\n    The wailings, shrieks, and sundry sorts of pain,\r\n      The sighs, the sobs, the deep and deadly groan;\r\n      Earth, air, and all, resounding plaint and moan.\r\n\r\n    \"Here puled the babes, and here the maids unwed\r\n    With folded hands their sorry chance bewailed,\r\n    Here wept the guiltless slain, and lovers dead,\r\n    That slew themselves when nothing else availed;\r\n    A thousand sorts of sorrows here, that wailed\r\n      With sighs and tears, sobs, shrieks, and all yfere\r\n      That oh, alas! it was a hell to hear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"_Lo here_, quoth Sorrow, princes of renown,\r\n    That whilom sat on top of fortune's wheel,\r\n    Now laid full low; like wretches whirled down,\r\n    Ev'n with one frown, that stayed but with a smile;\r\n    And now behold the thing that thou, erewhile,\r\n      Saw only in thought: and what thou now shalt hear,\r\n      Recount the same to kesar, king, and peer.\"[8]\r\n\r\n[8] The precedent descriptions of Sorrow herself, of Misery, and of Old\r\nAge, are even finer than the above, which, however, I have preferred for\r\nthree reasons. First, it has been less often quoted; secondly, its subject\r\nis a kind of commonplace, and, therefore, shows the poet's strength of\r\nhandling; thirdly, because of the singular and characteristic majesty of\r\nthe opening lines.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps well, in an early passage of a book which will have much to\r\ndo with the criticism of poetry, to dwell a little on what seems to the\r\ncritic to be the root of that matter. In the first place, I must entirely\r\ndiffer with those persons who have sought to create an independent prosody\r\nfor English verse under the head of \"beats\" or \"accents\" or something of\r\nthat sort. _Every English metre since Chaucer at least can be scanned,\r\nwithin the proper limits, according to the strictest rules of classical\r\nprosody: and while all good English metre comes out scatheless from the\r\napplication of those rules, nothing exhibits the badness of bad English\r\nmetre so well as that application._ It is, alongside of their great merits,\r\nthe distinguishing fault of Wyatt eminently, of Surrey to a less degree,\r\nand of all the new school up to Spenser more or less, that they neglect the\r\nquantity test too freely; it is the merit of Sackville that, holding on in\r\nthis respect to the good school of Chaucer, he observes it. You will find\r\nno \"jawbreakers\" in Sackville, no attempts to adjust English words on a\r\nProcrustean bed of independent quantification. He has not indeed the\r\nmanifold music of Spenser--it would be unreasonable to expect that he\r\nshould have it. But his stanzas, as the foregoing examples will show, are\r\nof remarkable melody, and they have about them a command, a completeness of\r\naccomplishment within the writer's intentions, which is very noteworthy in\r\nso young a man. The extraordinary richness and stateliness of the measure\r\nhas escaped no critic. There is indeed a certain one-sidedness about it,\r\nand a devil's advocate might urge that a long poem couched in verse (let\r\nalone the subject) of such unbroken gloom would be intolerable. But\r\nSackville did not write a long poem, and his complete command within his\r\nlimits of the effect at which he evidently aimed is most remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe second thing to note about the poem is the extraordinary freshness and\r\ntruth of its imagery. From a young poet we always expect second-hand\r\npresentations of nature, and in Sackville's day second-hand presentation of\r\nnature had been elevated to the rank of a science. Here the new\r\nschool--Surrey, Wyatt, and their followers--even if he had studied them,\r\ncould have given him little or no help, for great as are the merits of\r\nTottel's _Miscellany_, no one would go to it for representations of nature.\r\nAmong his predecessors in his own style he had to go back to Chaucer\r\n(putting the Scotch school out of the question) before he could find\r\nanything original. Yet it may be questioned whether the sketches of\r\nexternal scenery in these brief essays of his, or the embodiments of\r\ninternal thought in the pictures of Sorrow and the other allegorical\r\nwights, are most striking. It is perfectly clear that Thomas Sackville had,\r\nin the first place, a poetical eye to see, within as well as without, the\r\nobjects of poetical presentment; in the second place, a poetical vocabulary\r\nin which to clothe the results of his seeing; and in the third place, a\r\npoetical ear by aid of which to arrange his language in the musical\r\nco-ordination necessary to poetry. Wyatt had been too much to seek in the\r\nlast; Surrey had not been very obviously furnished with the first; and all\r\nthree were not to be possessed by any one else till Edmund Spenser arose to\r\nput Sackville's lessons in practice on a wider scale, and with a less\r\nmonotonous lyre. It is possible that Sackville's claims in drama may have\r\nbeen exaggerated--they have of late years rather been undervalued: but his\r\nclaims in poetry proper can only be overlooked by those who decline to\r\nconsider the most important part of poetry. In the subject of even his part\r\nof _The Mirror_ there is nothing new: there is only a following of Chaucer,\r\nand Gower, and Occleve, and Lydgate, and Hawes, and many others. But in the\r\nhandling there is one novelty which makes all others of no effect or\r\ninterest. It is the novelty of a new poetry.\r\n\r\nIt has already been remarked that these two important books were not\r\nimmediately followed by any others in poetry corresponding to their\r\nimportance. The poetry of the first half of Elizabeth's reign is as\r\nmediocre as the poetry of the last half of her reign is magnificent.\r\nAlthough it had taken some hints from Wyatt and Surrey it had not taken the\r\nbest; and the inexplicable devotion of most of the versifiers of the time\r\nto the doggerel metres already referred to seems to have prevented them\r\nfrom cultivating anything better. Yet the pains which were spent upon\r\ntranslation during this time were considerable, and undoubtedly had much to\r\ndo with strengthening and improving the language. The formal part of poetry\r\nbecame for the first time a subject of study resulting in the\r\n_Instructions_ of Gascoigne, and in the noteworthy critical works which\r\nwill be mentioned in the next chapter; while the popularity of poetical\r\nmiscellanies showed the audience that existed for verse. The translators\r\nand the miscellanists will each call for some brief notice; but first it is\r\nnecessary to mention some individual, and in their way, original writers\r\nwho, though not possessing merit at all equal to that of Wyatt, Surrey, and\r\nSackville, yet deserve to be singled from the crowd. These are Gascoigne,\r\nChurchyard, Turberville, Googe, and Tusser.\r\n\r\nThe poetaster and literary hack, Whetstone, who wrote a poetical memoir of\r\nGeorge Gascoigne after his death, entitles it a remembrance of \"the well\r\nemployed life and godly end\" of his hero. It is not necessary to dispute\r\nthat Gascoigne's end was godly; but except for the fact that he was for\r\nsome years a diligent and not unmeritorious writer, it is not so certain\r\nthat his life was well employed. At any rate he does not seem to have\r\nthought so himself. The date of his birth has been put as early as 1525 and\r\nas late as 1536: he certainly died in 1577. His father, a knight of good\r\nfamily and estate in Essex, disinherited him; but he was educated at\r\nCambridge, if not at both universities, was twice elected to Parliament,\r\ntravelled and fought abroad, and took part in the famous festival at\r\nKenilworth. His work is, as has been said, considerable, and is remarkable\r\nfor the number of first attempts in English which it contains. It has at\r\nleast been claimed for him (though careful students of literary history\r\nknow that these attributions are always rather hazardous) that he wrote the\r\nfirst English prose comedy (_The Supposes_, a version of Ariosto), the\r\nfirst regular verse satire (_The Steel Glass_), the first prose tale (a\r\nversion from Bandello), the first translation from Greek tragedy\r\n(_Jocasta_), and the first critical essay (the above-mentioned _Notes of\r\nInstruction_). Most of these things, it will be seen, were merely\r\nadaptations of foreign originals; but they certainly make up a remarkable\r\nbudget for one man. In addition to them, and to a good number of shorter\r\nand miscellaneous poems, must be mentioned the _Glass of Government_ (a\r\nkind of morality or serious comedy, moulded, it would seem, on German\r\noriginals), and the rather prettily, if fantastically termed _Flowers,\r\nHerbs, and Weeds_. Gascoigne has a very fair command of metre: he is not a\r\ngreat sinner in the childish alliteration which, surviving from the older\r\nEnglish poetry, helps to convert so much of his contemporaries' work into\r\ndoggerel. The pretty \"Lullaby of a Lover,\" and \"Gascoigne's Good Morrow\"\r\nmay be mentioned, and part of one of them may be quoted, as a fair specimen\r\nof his work, which is always tolerable if never first-rate.\r\n\r\n    \"Sing lullaby, as women do,\r\n    Wherewith they bring their babes to rest,\r\n    And lullaby can I sing too,\r\n    As womanly as can the best.\r\n    With lullaby they still the child;\r\n    And if I be not much beguiled,\r\n    Full many wanton babes have I\r\n    Which must be stilled with lullaby.\r\n\r\n    \"First lullaby, my youthful years.\r\n    It is now time to go to bed,\r\n    For crooked age and hoary hairs\r\n    Have won the hav'n within my head:\r\n    With lullaby then, youth, be still,\r\n    With lullaby content thy will,\r\n    Since courage quails and comes behind,\r\n    Go sleep and so beguile thy mind.\r\n\r\n    \"Next lullaby, my gazing eyes,\r\n    Which wanton were to glance apace,\r\n    For every glass may now suffice\r\n    To show the furrows in my face.\r\n    With lullaby then wink awhile,\r\n    With lullaby your looks beguile;\r\n    Let no fair face, nor beauty bright,\r\n    Entice you oft with vain delight.\r\n\r\n    \"And lullaby, my wanton will,\r\n    Let reason(s) rule now rein thy thought,\r\n    Since all too late I find by skill\r\n    How dear I have thy fancies bought:\r\n    With lullaby now take thine ease,\r\n    With lullaby thy doubts appease,\r\n    For trust to this, if thou be still\r\n    My body shall obey thy will.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Churchyard was an inferior sort of Gascoigne, who led a much longer\r\nif less eventful life. He was about the Court for the greater part of the\r\ncentury, and had a habit of calling his little books, which were numerous,\r\nand written both in verse and prose, by alliterative titles playing on his\r\nown name, such as _Churchyard's Chips_, _Churchyard's Choice_, and so\r\nforth. He was a person of no great literary power, and chiefly noteworthy\r\nbecause of his long life after contributing to Tottel's _Miscellany_, which\r\nmakes him a link between the old literature and the new.\r\n\r\nThe literary interests and tentative character of the time, together with\r\nits absence of original genius, and the constant symptoms of not having\r\n\"found its way,\" are also very noteworthy in George Turberville and Barnabe\r\nGooge, who were friends and verse writers of not dissimilar character.\r\nTurberville, of whom not much is known, was a Dorsetshire man of good\r\nfamily, and was educated at Winchester and Oxford. His birth and death\r\ndates are both extremely uncertain. Besides a book on Falconry and numerous\r\ntranslations (to which, like all the men of his school and day, he was much\r\naddicted), he wrote a good many occasional poems, trying even blank verse.\r\nBarnabe Googe, a Lincolnshire man, and a member of both universities,\r\nappears to have been born in 1540, was employed in Ireland, and died in\r\n1594. He was kin to the Cecils, and Mr. Arber has recovered some rather\r\ninteresting details about his love affairs, in which he was assisted by\r\nLord Burghley. He, too, was an indefatigable translator, and wrote some\r\noriginal poems. Both poets affected the combination of Alexandrine and\r\nfourteener (split up or not, as the printer chose, into six, six, eight,\r\nsix), the popularity of which has been noted, and both succumbed too often\r\nto its capacities of doggerel. Turberville's best work is the following\r\nsong in a pretty metre well kept up:--\r\n\r\n    \"The green that you did wish me wear\r\n                Aye for your love,\r\n    And on my helm a branch to bear\r\n                Not to remove,\r\n    Was ever you to have in mind\r\n    Whom Cupid hath my feire assigned.\r\n\r\n    \"As I in this have done your will\r\n                And mind to do,\r\n    So I request you to fulfil\r\n                My fancy too;\r\n    A green and loving heart to have,\r\n    And this is all that I do crave.\r\n\r\n    \"For if your flowering heart should change\r\n                His colour green,\r\n    Or you at length a lady strange\r\n                Of me be seen,\r\n    Then will my branch against his use\r\n    His colour change for your refuse.[9]\r\n\r\n    \"As winter's force cannot deface\r\n                This branch his hue,\r\n    So let no change of love disgrace\r\n                Your friendship true;\r\n    You were mine own, and so be still,\r\n    So shall we live and love our fill.\r\n\r\n    \"Then I may think myself to be\r\n                Well recompensed,\r\n    For wearing of the tree that is\r\n                So well defensed\r\n    Against all weather that doth fall\r\n    When wayward winter spits his gall.\r\n\r\n    \"And when we meet, to try me true,\r\n                Look on my head,\r\n    And I will crave an oath of you\r\n                Whe'r[10] Faith be fled;\r\n    So shall we both answered be,\r\n    Both I of you, and you of me.\"\r\n\r\n[9] Refusal.\r\n\r\n[10] Short for \"whether.\"\r\n\r\nThe most considerable and the most interesting part of Googe's work is a\r\nset of eight eclogues which may not have been without influence on _The\r\nShepherd's Calendar_, and a poem of some length entitled _Cupido\r\nConquered_, which Spenser may also have seen. Googe has more sustained\r\npower than Turberville, but is much inferior to him in command of metre and\r\nin lyrical swing. In him, or at least in his printer, the mania for cutting\r\nup long verses reaches its height, and his very decasyllables are found\r\narranged in the strange fashion of four and six as thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"Good aged Bale:\r\n    That with thy hoary hairs\r\n    Dost still persist\r\n    To turn the painful book,\r\n    O happy man,\r\n    That hast obtained such years,\r\n    And leav'st not yet\r\n    On papers pale to look.\r\n    Give over now\r\n    To beat thy wearied brain,\r\n    And rest thy pen,\r\n    That long hath laboured sore.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Tusser (1524?-1580) has often been regarded as merely a writer of\r\ndoggerel, which is assuredly not lacking in his _Hundred_ (later _Five\r\nHundred_) _Points of Husbandry_ (1557-1573). But he has some piquancy of\r\nphrase, and is particularly noticeable for the variety, and to a certain\r\nextent the accomplishment, of his prosodic experiments--a point of much\r\nimportance for the time.\r\n\r\nTo these five, of whom some substantive notice has been given, many shadowy\r\nnames might be added if the catalogue were of any use: such as those of\r\nKinwelmersh, Whetstone, Phaer, Neville, Blundeston, Edwards, Golding, and\r\nmany others. They seem to have been for the most part personally acquainted\r\nwith one another; the literary energies of England being almost confined to\r\nthe universities and the Inns of Court, so that most of those who devoted\r\nthemselves to literature came into contact and formed what is sometimes\r\ncalled a clique. They were all studiously and rather indiscriminately given\r\nto translation (the body of foreign work, ancient and modern, which was\r\nturned into English during this quarter of a century being very large\r\nindeed), and all or many of them were contributors of commendatory verses\r\nto each other's work and of pieces of different descriptions to the\r\npoetical miscellanies of the time. Of these miscellanies and of the chief\r\ntranslations from the classics some little notice may be taken because of\r\nthe great part which both played in the poetical education of England. It\r\nhas been said that almost all the original poets were also translators.\r\nThus Googe Englished, among other things, the _Zodiacus Vitae_ of Marcellus\r\nPalingenius, the _Regnum Papisticum_ of Kirchmayer, the _Four Books of\r\nHusbandry_ of Conrad Heresbach, and the _Proverbs_ of the Marquis of\r\nSantillana; but some of the translators were not distinguished by any\r\noriginal work. Thus Jasper Heywood, followed by Neville above mentioned, by\r\nStudley, and others, translated between 1560 and 1580 those tragedies of\r\nSeneca which had such a vast influence on foreign literature and,\r\nfortunately, so small an influence on English. Arthur Golding gave in 1567\r\na version, by no means destitute of merit, of the _Metamorphoses_ which had\r\na great influence on English poetry. We have already mentioned Surrey's\r\nblank-verse translation of Virgil. This was followed up, in 1555-60, by\r\nThomas Phaer, who, like most of the persons mentioned in this paragraph,\r\nused the fourteener, broken up or not, as accident or the necessities of\r\nthe printer brought it about.\r\n\r\nIt was beyond doubt this abundant translation, and perhaps also the\r\nmanifest deficiencies of the fourteener thus used, which brought about at\r\nthe close of the present period and the beginning of the next the\r\nextraordinary attempt to reproduce classical metres in English verse, which\r\nfor a time seduced even Spenser, which was not a little countenanced by\r\nmost of the critical writers of the period, which led Gabriel Harvey and\r\nothers into such absurdities, and which was scarcely slain even by Daniel's\r\nfamous and capital _Defence of Rhyme_. The discussion of this absurd\r\nattempt (for which rules, not now extant, came from Drant of Cambridge) in\r\nthe correspondence of Spenser and Harvey, and the sensible fashion in which\r\nNash laughed at it, are among the best known things in the gossiping\r\nhistory of English Letters. But the coxcombry of Harvey and the felicitous\r\nimpertinence of Nash have sometimes diverted attention from the actual\r\nstate of the case. William Webbe (a very sober-minded person with taste\r\nenough to admire the \"new poet,\" as he calls Spenser) makes elaborate\r\nattempts not merely at hexameters, which, though only a curiosity, are a\r\npossible curiosity in English, but at Sapphics which could never (except as\r\nburlesque) be tolerable. Sidney, Spenser, and others gave serious heed to\r\nthe scheme of substituting classical metres without rhyme for indigenous\r\nmetres with rhyme. And unless the two causes which brought this about are\r\nconstantly kept in mind, the reason of it will not be understood. It was\r\nundoubtedly the weakness of contemporary English verse which reinforced the\r\ngeneral Renaissance admiration for the classics; nor must it be forgotten\r\nthat Wyatt takes, in vernacular metres and with rhyme, nearly as great\r\nliberties with the intonation and prosody of the language as any of the\r\nclassicists in their unlucky hexameters and elegiacs. The majesty and grace\r\nof the learned tongues, contrasting with the poverty of their own language,\r\nimpressed, and to a great extent rightly impressed, the early Elizabethans,\r\nso that they naturally enough cast about for any means to improve the one,\r\nand hesitated at any peculiarity which was not found in the other. It was\r\nunpardonable in Milton to sneer at rhyme after the fifty years of\r\nmagnificent production which had put English on a level with Greek and\r\nabove Latin as a literary instrument. But for Harvey and Spenser, Sidney\r\nand Webbe, with those fifty years still to come, the state of the case was\r\nvery different.\r\n\r\nThe translation mania and the classicising mania together led to the\r\nproduction of perhaps the most absurd book in all literature--a book which\r\ndeserves extended notice here, partly because it has only recently become\r\naccessible to the general reader in its original form, and partly because\r\nit is, though a caricature, yet a very instructive caricature of the\r\ntendencies and literary ideas of the time. This is Richard Stanyhurst's\r\ntranslation of the first four books of the _AEneid_, first printed at Leyden\r\nin the summer of 1582, and reprinted in London a year later. This wonderful\r\nbook (in which the spelling is only less marvellous than the phraseology\r\nand verse) shows more than anything else the active throes which English\r\nliterature was undergoing, and though the result was but a false birth it\r\nis none the less interesting.\r\n\r\nStanyhurst was not, as might be hastily imagined, a person of insufficient\r\nculture or insufficient brains. He was an Irish Roman Catholic gentleman,\r\nbrother-in-law to Lord Dunsany, and uncle to Archbishop Usher, and though\r\nhe was author of the Irish part of Holinshed's _History_, he has always\r\nbeen regarded by the madder sort of Hibernians as a traitor to the nation.\r\nHis father was Recorder of Dublin, and he himself, having been born about\r\n1547, was educated at University College, Oxford, and went thence, if not\r\nto the Inns of Court, at any rate to those of Chancery, and became a\r\nstudent of Furnival's Inn. He died at Brussels in 1618. Here is an example\r\nof his prose, the latter part of which is profitable for matter as well as\r\nfor form:--\r\n\r\n     \"How beyt[11] I haue heere haulf a guesh, that two sorts of\r\n     carpers wyl seeme too spurne at this myne enterprise. Thee one\r\n     vtterlie ignorant, the oother meanlye letterd.

For a few such stiches boch vp\r\n     oure newe fashion makers.

Yet this was what a man of undoubted talent, of considerable\r\nlearning, and of no small acuteness (for Stanyhurst's Preface to this very\r\ntranslation shows something more than glimmerings on the subject of\r\nclassical and English prosody), could produce. It must never be forgotten\r\nthat the men of this time were at a hopelessly wrong point of view. It\r\nnever occurred to them that English left to itself could equal Greek or\r\nLatin. They simply endeavoured, with the utmost pains and skill, to drag\r\nEnglish up to the same level as these unapproachable languages by forcing\r\nit into the same moulds which Greek and Latin had endured. Properly\r\nspeaking we ought not to laugh at them. They were carrying out in\r\nliterature what the older books of arithmetic call \"The Rule of\r\nFalse,\"--that is to say, they were trying what the English tongue could\r\n_not_ bear. No one was so successful as Stanyhurst in applying this test of\r\nthe rack: yet it is fair to say that Harvey and Webbe, nay, Spenser and\r\nSidney, had practically, though, except in Spenser's case, it would appear\r\nunconsciously, arrived at the same conclusion before. How much we owe to\r\nsuch adventurers of the impossible few men know except those who have tried\r\nto study literature as a whole.\r\n\r\nA few words have to be said in passing as to the miscellanies which played\r\nsuch an important part in the poetical literature of the day. Tottel and\r\n_The Mirror for Magistrates_ (which was, considering its constant\r\naccretions, a sort of miscellany) have been already noticed. They were\r\nfollowed by not a few others. The first in date was _The Paradise of Dainty\r\nDevices_ (1576), edited by R. Edwards, a dramatist of industry if not of\r\ngenius, and containing a certain amount of interesting work. It was very\r\npopular, going through nine or ten editions in thirty years, but with a few\r\nscattered exceptions it does not yield much to the historian of English\r\npoetry. Its popularity shows what was expected; its contents show what, at\r\nany rate at the date of its first appearance, was given. It is possible\r\nthat the doleful contents of _The Mirror for Magistrates_ (which was\r\nreprinted six times during our present period, and which busied itself\r\nwholly with what magistrates should avoid, and with the sorrowful departing\r\nout of this life of the subjects) may have had a strong effect on Edwards,\r\nthough one at least of his contributors, W. Hunnis, was a man of mould. It\r\nwas followed in 1578 by _A Gorgeous Gallery of Gallant Inventions_,\r\nsupposed to have been edited by Roydon and Proctor, which is a still drier\r\nstick. The next miscellany, six years later, _A Handful of Pleasant\r\nDelights_, edited by Clement Robinson, is somewhat better though not much.\r\nIt is followed by the _Phoenix Nest_, an interesting collection, by no less\r\nthan three miscellanies in 1600, edited by \"A. B.\" and R. Allot, and named\r\n_England's Helicon_, _England's Parnassus_, and _Belvedere_ (the two latter\r\nbeing rather anthologies of extracts than miscellanies proper), and by\r\nFrancis Davison's famous _Poetical Rhapsody_, 1602, all which last belong\r\nto a much later date than our present subjects.\r\n\r\nTo call the general poetical merit of these earlier miscellanies high would\r\nbe absurd. But what at once strikes the reader, not merely of them but of\r\nthe collections of individual work which accompany them, as so astonishing,\r\nis the level which is occasionally reached. The work is often the work of\r\npersons quite unknown or unimportant in literature as persons. But we\r\nconstantly see in it a flash, a symptom of the presence of the true\r\npoetical spirit which it is often impossible to find for years together in\r\nother periods of poetry. For instance, if ever there was a \"dull dog\" in\r\nverse it was Richard Edwards. Yet in _The Paradise of Dainty Devices_\r\nEdwards's poem with the refrain \"The falling out of faithful friends\r\nrenewing is of love,\" is one of the most charming things anywhere to be\r\nfound. So is, after many years, the poem attributed to John Wooton in\r\n_England's Helicon_ (the best of the whole set), beginning \"Her eyes like\r\nshining lamps,\" so is the exquisite \"Come, little babe\" from _The Arbour of\r\nAmorous Devices_, so are dozens and scores more which may be found in their\r\nproper places, and many of them in Mr. Arber's admirable _English Garner_.\r\nThe spirit of poetry, rising slowly, was rising surely in the England of\r\nthese years: no man knew exactly where it would appear, and the greatest\r\npoets were--for their praises of themselves and their fellows are quite\r\nunconscious and simple--as ignorant as others. The first thirty years of\r\nthe reign were occupied with simple education--study of models, efforts in\r\nthis or that kind, translation, and the rest. But the right models had been\r\nprovided by Wyatt and Surrey's study of the Italians, and by the study of\r\nthe classics which all men then pursued; and the original inspiration,\r\nwithout which the best models are useless, though itself can do little when\r\nthe best models are not used, was abundantly present. Few things are more\r\ncurious than to compare, let us say, Googe and Spenser. Yet few things are\r\nmore certain than that without the study and experiments which Googe\r\nrepresents Spenser could not have existed. Those who decry the historical\r\nmethod in criticism ignore this; and ignorance like wisdom is justified of\r\nall her children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nEARLY ELIZABETHAN PROSE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the earlier Elizabethan prose, if we except the name of\r\nHooker, in whom it culminates, is to a great extent the history of\r\ncuriosities of literature--of tentative and imperfect efforts, scarcely\r\nresulting in any real vernacular style at all. It is, however, emphatically\r\nthe Period of Origins of modern English prose, and as such cannot but be\r\ninteresting. We shall therefore rapidly survey its chief developments,\r\nnoting first what had been done before Elizabeth came to the throne, then\r\ntaking Ascham (who stands, though part of his work was written earlier,\r\nvery much as the first Elizabethan prosaist), noticing the schools of\r\nhistorians, translators, controversialists, and especially critics who\r\nillustrated the middle period of the reign, and singling out the noteworthy\r\npersonality of Sidney. We shall also say something of Lyly (as far as\r\n_Euphues_ is concerned) and his singular attempts in prose style, and shall\r\nfinish with Hooker, the one really great name of the period. Its voluminous\r\npamphleteering, though much of it, especially the Martin Marprelate\r\ncontroversy, might come chronologically within the limit of this chapter,\r\nwill be better reserved for a notice in Chapter VI. of the whole pamphlet\r\nliterature of the reigns of Elizabeth and James--an interesting subject,\r\nthe relation of which to the modern periodical has been somewhat\r\noverlooked, and which indeed was, until a comparatively recent period, not\r\nvery easy to study. Gabriel Harvey alone, as distinctly belonging to the\r\nearlier Elizabethans, may be here included with other critics.\r\n\r\nIt was an inevitable result of the discovery of printing that the\r\ncultivation of the vernacular for purposes of all work--that is to say, for\r\nprose--should be largely increased. Yet a different influence arising, or\r\nat least eked out, from the same source, rather checked this increase. The\r\nstudy of the classical writers had at first a tendency to render inveterate\r\nthe habit of employing Latin for the journey-work of literature, and in the\r\ntwo countries which were to lead Western Europe for the future (the\r\nliterary date of Italy was already drawing to a close, and Italy had long\r\npossessed vernacular prose masterpieces), it was not till the middle of the\r\nsixteenth century that the writing of vernacular prose was warmly advocated\r\nand systematically undertaken. The most interesting monuments of this\r\ncrusade, as it may almost be called, in England are connected with a school\r\nof Cambridge scholars who flourished a little before our period, though not\r\na few of them, such as Ascham, Wilson, and others, lived into it. A letter\r\nof Sir John Cheke's in the very year of the accession of Elizabeth is the\r\nmost noteworthy document on the subject. It was written to another father\r\nof English prose, Sir Thomas Hoby, the translator of Castiglione's\r\n_Courtier_. But Ascham had already and some years earlier published his\r\n_Toxophilus_, and various not unimportant attempts, detailed notice of\r\nwhich would be an antedating of our proper period, had been made. More's\r\nchief work, _Utopia_, had been written in Latin, and was translated into\r\nEnglish by another hand, but his _History of Edward V._ was not a mean\r\ncontribution to English prose. Tyndale's _New Testament_ had given a new\r\nand powerful impulse to the reading of English; Elyot's _Governor_ had set\r\nthe example of treating serious subjects in a style not unworthy of them,\r\nand Leland's quaint _Itinerary_ the example of describing more or less\r\nfaithfully if somewhat uncouthly. Hall had followed Fabyan as an English\r\nhistorian, and, above all, Latimer's _Sermons_ had shown how to transform\r\nspoken English of the raciest kind into literature. Lord Berners's\r\ntranslations of Froissart and of divers examples of late Continental\r\nromance had provided much prose of no mean quality for light reading, and\r\nalso by their imitation of the florid and fanciful style of the\r\nFrench-Flemish _rhetoriqueurs_ (with which Berners was familiar both as a\r\nstudent of French and as governor of Calais) had probably contributed not a\r\nlittle to supply and furnish forth the side of Elizabethan expression which\r\nfound so memorable an exponent in the author of _Euphues_.\r\n\r\nFor our purpose, however, Roger Ascham may serve as a starting-point. His\r\n_Toxophilus_ was written and printed as early as 1545; his _Schoolmaster_\r\ndid not appear till after his death, and seems to have been chiefly written\r\nin the very last days of his life. There is thus nearly a quarter of a\r\ncentury between them, yet they are not very different in style. Ascham was\r\na Yorkshire man born at Kirbywiske, near Northallerton, in 1515; he went to\r\nSt. John's College at Cambridge, then a notable seat of learning, in 1530;\r\nwas elected scholar, fellow, and lecturer, became public orator the year\r\nafter the appearance of _Toxophilus_, acted as tutor to the Princess\r\nElizabeth, went on diplomatic business to Germany, was Latin secretary to\r\nQueen Mary, and after her death to his old pupil, and died on the 30th\r\nDecember 1568. A treatise on Cock-fighting (of which sport he was very\r\nfond) appears to have been written by him, and was perhaps printed, but is\r\nunluckily lost. We have also Epistles from him, and his works, both English\r\nand Latin, have been in whole or part frequently edited. The great interest\r\nof Ascham is expressed as happily as possible by his own words in the\r\ndedication of _Toxophilus_ to Henry VIII. \"Although,\" he says, \"to have\r\nwritten this book either in Latin or Greek ... had been more easier and fit\r\nfor my trade in study, yet ... I have written this English matter in the\r\nEnglish tongue for Englishmen\"--a memorable sentence none the worse for its\r\njingle and repetition, which are well in place. Until scholars like Ascham,\r\nwho with the rarest exceptions were the only persons likely or able to\r\nwrite at all, cared to write \"English matters in English tongue for\r\nEnglishmen,\" the formation of English prose style was impossible; and that\r\nit required some courage to do so, Cheke's letter, written twelve years\r\nlater, shows.[12]\r\n\r\n     \"I am of this opinion that our own tongue should be written clean\r\n     and pure, unmixed and unmingled with borrowing of other tongues,\r\n     wherein, if we take not heed by time, ever borrowing and never\r\n     paying, she shall be fain to keep her house as bankrupt. For then\r\n     doth our tongue naturally and praisably utter her meaning, when\r\n     she borroweth no counterfeitures of other tongues to attire\r\n     herself withal, but useth plainly her own with such shift as\r\n     nature, craft, experience, and following of other excellent doth\r\n     lead her unto, and if she want at any time (as being imperfect\r\n     she must) yet let her borrow with such bashfulness that it may\r\n     appear, that if either the mould of our own tongue could serve us\r\n     to fashion a word of our own, or if the old denizened words could\r\n     content and ease this need we would not boldly venture of unknown\r\n     words.\"[13]\r\n\r\n[12] The letter is given in full by Mr. Arber in his introduction to\r\nAscham's _Schoolmaster_, p. 5.\r\n\r\n[13] It will be seen that Cheke writes what he argues for, \"clean and pure\r\nEnglish.\" \"Other excellent\" is perhaps the only doubtful phrase in the\r\nextract or in the letter.\r\n\r\nThe _Toxophilus_ and the _Schoolmaster_ are both in their different ways\r\nvery pleasant reading; and the English is far more correct than that of\r\nmuch greater men than Ascham in the next century. It is, however, merely as\r\nstyle, less interesting, because it is clear that the author is doing\r\nlittle more than translate in his head, instead of on the paper, good\r\ncurrent Latin (such as it would have been \"more easier\" for him to write)\r\ninto current English. He does not indulge in any undue classicism; he takes\r\nfew of the liberties with English grammar which, a little later, it was the\r\nhabit to take on the strength of classical examples. But, on the other\r\nhand, he does not attempt, and it would be rather unreasonable to expect\r\nthat he should have attempted, experiments in the literary power of English\r\nitself. A slight sense of its not being so \"easy\" to write in English as in\r\nLatin, and of the consequent advisableness of keeping to a sober beaten\r\npath, to a kind of style which is not much more English (except for being\r\ncomposed of good English words in straightforward order) than it is any\r\nliterary language framed to a great extent on the classics, shows itself in\r\nhim. One might translate passage after passage of Ascham, keeping almost\r\nthe whole order of the words, into very good sound Latin prose; and,\r\nindeed, his great secret in the _Schoolmaster_ (the perpetual translation\r\nand retranslation of English into the learned languages, and especially\r\nLatin) is exactly what would form such a style. It is, as the following\r\nexamples from both works will show, clear, not inelegant, invaluable as a\r\nkind of go-cart to habituate the infant limbs of prose English to orderly\r\nmovement; but it is not original, or striking, or characteristic, or\r\ncalculated to show the native powers and capacities of the language.\r\n\r\n     \"I can teach you to shoot fair, even as Socrates taught a man\r\n     once to know God. For when he asked him what was God? 'Nay,'\r\n     saith he, 'I can tell you better what God is not, as God is not\r\n     ill, God is unspeakable, unsearchable, and so forth. Even\r\n     likewise can I say of fair shooting, it hath not this\r\n     discommodity with it nor that discommodity, and at last a man may\r\n     so shift all the discommodities from shooting that there shall be\r\n     left nothing behind but fair shooting. And to do this the better\r\n     you must remember how that I told you when I described generally\r\n     the whole nature of shooting, that fair shooting came of these\r\n     things of standing, nocking, drawing, holding and loosing; the\r\n     which I will go over as shortly as I can, describing the\r\n     discommodities that men commonly use in all parts of their\r\n     bodies, that you, if you fault in any such, may know it, and go\r\n     about to amend it. Faults in archers do exceed the number of\r\n     archers, which come with use of shooting without teaching. Use\r\n     and custom separated from knowledge and learning, doth not only\r\n     hurt shooting, but the most weighty things in the world beside.\r\n     And, therefore, I marvel much at those people which be the\r\n     maintainers of uses without knowledge, having no other word in\r\n     their mouth but this use, use, custom, custom. Such men, more\r\n     wilful than wise, beside other discommodities, take all place and\r\n     occasion from all amendment. And this I speak generally of use\r\n     and custom.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"Time was when Italy and Rome have been, to the great good of us\r\n     who now live, the best breeders and bringers up of the worthiest\r\n     men, not only for wise speaking, but also for well-doing in all\r\n     civil affairs that ever was in the world. But now that time is\r\n     gone; and though the place remain, yet the old and present\r\n     manners do differ as far as black and white, as virtue and vice.\r\n     Virtue once made that country mistress over all the world: vice\r\n     now maketh that country slave to them that before were glad to\r\n     serve it. All man [_i.e._ mankind] seeth it; they themselves\r\n     confess it, namely such as be best and wisest amongst them. For\r\n     sin, by lust and vanity, hath and doth breed up everywhere common\r\n     contempt of God's word, private contention in many families, open\r\n     factions in every city; and so making themselves bond to vanity\r\n     and vice at home, they are content to bear the yoke of serving\r\n     strangers abroad. Italy now is not that Italy it was wont to be;\r\n     and therefore now not so fit a place as some do count it for\r\n     young men to fetch either wisdom or honesty from thence. For\r\n     surely they will make others but bad scholars that be so ill\r\n     masters to themselves.\"\r\n\r\nThis same characteristic, or absence of characteristic, which reaches its\r\nclimax--a climax endowing it with something like substantive life and\r\nmerit--in Hooker, displays itself, with more and more admixture of raciness\r\nand native peculiarity, in almost all the prose of the early Elizabethan\r\nperiod up to the singular escapade of Lyly, who certainly tried to write\r\nnot a classical style but a style of his own. The better men, with Thomas\r\nWilson and Ascham himself at their head, made indeed earnest protests\r\nagainst Latinising the vocabulary (the great fault of the contemporary\r\nFrench _Pleiade_), but they were not quite aware how much they were under\r\nthe influence of Latin in other matters. The translators, such as North,\r\nwhose famous version of Plutarch after Amyot had the immortal honour of\r\nsuggesting not a little of Shakespere's greatest work, had the chief excuse\r\nand temptation in doing this; but all writers did it more or less: the\r\ntheologians (to whom it would no doubt have been \"more easier\" to write in\r\nLatin), the historians (though the little known Holinshed has broken off\r\ninto a much more vernacular but also much more disorderly style), the rare\r\ngeographers (of whom the chief is Richard Eden, the first English writer on\r\nAmerica), and the rest. Of this rest the most interesting, perhaps, are the\r\nsmall but curious knot of critics who lead up in various ways to Sidney and\r\nHarvey, who seem to have excited considerable interest at the time, and who\r\nwere not succeeded, after the early years of James, by any considerable\r\nbody of critics of English till John Dryden began to write in the last\r\nthird of the following century. Of these (putting out of sight Stephen\r\nGosson, the immediate begetter of Sidney's _Apology for Poetry_, Campion,\r\nthe chief champion of classical metres in English, and by a quaint contrast\r\nthe author of some of the most charming of English songs in purely romantic\r\nstyle, with his adversary the poet Daniel, Meres, etc.), the chief is the\r\nauthor of the anonymous _Art of English Poesie_, published the year after\r\nthe Armada, and just before the appearance of _The Faerie Queene_. This\r\n_Art_ has chiefly to be compared with the _Discourse of English Poetrie_,\r\npublished three years earlier by William Webbe. Webbe, of whom nothing is\r\nknown save that he was a private tutor at one or two gentlemen's houses in\r\nEssex, exhibits that dislike and disdain of rhyme which was an offshoot of\r\nthe passion for humanist studies, which was importantly represented all\r\nthrough the sixteenth and early seventeenth century in England, and which\r\nhad Milton for its last and greatest exponent. _The Art of English Poesie_,\r\nwhich is attributed on no grounds of contemporary evidence to George\r\nPuttenham, though the book was generally reputed his in the next\r\ngeneration, is a much more considerable treatise, some four times the\r\nlength of Webbe's, dealing with a large number of questions subsidiary to\r\n_Ars Poetica_, and containing no few selections of illustrative verse, many\r\nof the author's own. As far as style goes both Webbe and Puttenham fall\r\ninto the rather colourless but not incorrect class already described, and\r\nare of the tribe of Ascham. Here is a sample of each:--\r\n\r\n     (Webbe's _Preface to the Noble Poets of England_.)\r\n\r\n     \"Among the innumerable sorts of English books, and infinite\r\n     fardels of printed pamphlets, wherewith this country is pestered,\r\n     all shops stuffed, and every study furnished; the greater part, I\r\n     think, in any one kind, are such as are either mere poetical, or\r\n     which tend in some respects (as either in matter or form) to\r\n     poetry. Of such books, therefore, sith I have been one that have\r\n     had a desire to read not the fewest, and because it is an\r\n     argument which men of great learning have no leisure to handle,\r\n     or at least having to do with more serious matters do least\r\n     regard. If I write something, concerning what I think of our\r\n     English poets, or adventure to set down my simple judgment of\r\n     English poetry, I trust the learned poets will give me leave, and\r\n     vouchsafe my book passage, as being for the rudeness thereof no\r\n     prejudice to their noble studies, but even (as my intent is) an\r\n     _instar cotis_ to stir up some other of meet ability to bestow\r\n     travail in this matter; whereby, I think, we may not only get the\r\n     means which we yet want, to discern between good writers and bad,\r\n     but perhaps also challenge from the rude multitude of rustical\r\n     rhymers, who will be called poets, the right practice and orderly\r\n     course of true poetry.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     (Puttenham _on Style_.)\r\n\r\n     \"Style is a constant and continual phrase or tenour of speaking\r\n     and writing, extending to the whole tale or process of the poem\r\n     or history, and not properly to any piece or member of a tale;\r\n     but is of words, speeches, and sentences together; a certain\r\n     contrived form and quality, many times natural to the writer,\r\n     many times his peculiar bye-election and art, and such as either\r\n     he keepeth by skill or holdeth on by ignorance, and will not or\r\n     peradventure cannot easily alter into any other. So we say that\r\n     Cicero's style and Sallust's were not one, nor Caesar's and\r\n     Livy's, nor Homer's and Hesiodus',[14] nor Herodotus' and\r\n     Thucydides', nor Euripides' and Aristophanes', nor Erasmus' and\r\n     Budeus' styles. And because this continual course and manner of\r\n     writing or speech sheweth the matter and disposition of the\r\n     writer's mind more than one or two instances can show, therefore\r\n     there be that have called style the image of man (_mentis\r\n     character_). For man is but his mind, and as his mind is tempered\r\n     and qualified, so are his speeches and language at large; and his\r\n     inward conceits be the metal of his mind, and his manner of\r\n     utterance the very warp and woof of his conceits, more plain or\r\n     busy and intricate or otherwise affected after the rate.\"[15]\r\n\r\n[14] The final _s_ of such names often at the time appears unaltered.\r\n\r\n[15] _i.e._ \"in proportion.\"\r\n\r\nContemporary with these, however, there was growing up a quite different\r\nschool of English prose which showed itself on one side in the _estilo\r\nculto_ of Lyly and the university wits of his time; on the other, in the\r\nextremely vernacular and sometimes extremely vulgar manner of the\r\npamphleteers, who were very often the same persons. Lyly himself exhibits\r\nboth styles in _Euphues_; and if _Pap with a Hatchet_ and _An Almond for a\r\nParrot_ are rightly attributed to him, still more in these. So also does\r\nGabriel Harvey, Spenser's friend, a curious coxcomb who endeavoured to\r\ndissuade Spenser from continuing _The Faerie Queene_, devoted much time\r\nhimself and strove to devote other people to the thankless task of\r\ncomposing English hexameters and trimeters, engaged (very much to his\r\ndiscomfiture) in a furious pamphlet war with Thomas Nash, and altogether\r\npresents one of the most characteristic though least favourable specimens\r\nof the Elizabethan man of letters. We may speak of him further when we come\r\nto the pamphleteers generally.\r\n\r\nJohn Lyly is a person of much more consequence in English literature than\r\nthe conceited and pragmatical pedant who wrote _Pierce's Supererogation_.\r\nHe is familiar, almost literally to every schoolboy, as the author of the\r\ncharming piece, \"Cupid with my Campaspe Played,\" and his dramatic work will\r\ncome in for notice in a future chapter; but he is chiefly thought of by\r\nposterity, whether favourably or the reverse, as the author of _Euphues_.\r\nExceedingly little is known about his life, and it is necessary to say that\r\nthe usually accepted dates of his death, his children's birth, and so\r\nforth, depend wholly on the identification of a John Lilly, who is the\r\nsubject of such entries in the registers of a London church, with the\r\neuphuist and dramatist--an identification which requires confirmation. A\r\nstill more wanton attempt to supplement ignorance with knowledge has been\r\nmade in the further identification with Lyly of a certain \"witty and bold\r\natheist,\" who annoyed Bishop Hall in his first cure at Hawstead, in\r\nSuffolk, and who is called \"Mr. Lilly.\" All supposed facts about him (or\r\nsome other John Lyly), his membership of Parliament and so forth, have been\r\ndiligently set forth by Mr. Bond in his Oxford edition of the _Works_, with\r\nthe documents which are supposed to prove them. He is supposed, on\r\nuncertain but tolerable inferences, to have been born about 1554, and he\r\ncertainly entered Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1569, though he was not\r\nmatriculated till two years later. He is described as _plebeii filius_, was\r\nnot on the foundation, and took his degree in 1573. He must have had some\r\nconnection with the Cecils, for a letter of 1574 is extant from him to\r\nBurleigh. He cannot have been five and twenty when he wrote _Euphues_,\r\nwhich was licensed at the end of 1578, and was published (the first part)\r\nearly next year, while the second part followed with a very short\r\ninterval. In 1582 he wrote an unmistakable letter commendatory to Watson's\r\n_Hecatompathia_, and between 1580 and 1590 he must have written his plays.\r\nHe appears to have continued to reside at Magdalen for a considerable time,\r\nand then to have haunted the Court. A melancholy petition is extant to\r\nQueen Elizabeth from him, the second of its kind, in which he writes:\r\n\"Thirteen years your highness' servant, but yet nothing.\" This was in 1598:\r\nhe is supposed to have died in 1606. _Euphues_ is a very singular book,\r\nwhich was constantly reprinted and eagerly read for fifty years, then\r\nforgotten for nearly two hundred, then frequently discussed, but very\r\nseldom read, even it may be suspected in Mr. Arber's excellent reprint of\r\nit, or in that of Mr. Bond. It gave a word to English, and even yet there\r\nis no very distinct idea attaching to the word. It induced one of the most\r\ngifted restorers of old times to make a blunder, amusing in itself, but not\r\nin the least what its author intended it to be, and of late years\r\nespecially it has prompted constant discussions as to the origin of the\r\npeculiarities which mark it. As usual, we shall try to discuss it with less\r\nreference to what has been said about it than to itself.\r\n\r\n_Euphues_ (properly divided into two parts, \"Euphues, the Anatomy of Wit,\"\r\nand \"Euphues and his England,\" the scene of the first lying in Naples) is a\r\nkind of love story; the action, however, being next to nothing, and\r\nsubordinated to an infinite amount of moral and courtly discourse. Oddly\r\nenough, the unfavourable sentence of Hallam, that it is \"a very dull\r\nstory,\" and the favourable sentence of Kingsley, that it is \"a brave,\r\nrighteous, and pious book,\" are both quite true, and, indeed, any one can\r\nsee that there is nothing incompatible in them. At the present day,\r\nhowever, its substance, which chiefly consists of the moral discourses\r\naforesaid, is infinitely inferior in interest to its manner. Of that\r\nmanner, any one who imagines it to be reproduced by Sir Piercie Shafton's\r\nextravagances in _The Monastery_ has an entirely false idea. It is much\r\nodder than Shaftonese, but also quite different from it. Lyly's two\r\nsecrets are in the first place an antithesis, more laboured, more\r\nmonotonous, and infinitely more pointless than Macaulay's--which antithesis\r\nseems to have met with not a little favour, and was indeed an obvious\r\nexpedient for lightening up and giving character to the correct but\r\nfeatureless prose of Ascham and other \"Latiners.\" The second was a fancy,\r\nwhich amounts to a mania, for similes, strung together in endless lists,\r\nand derived as a rule from animals, vegetables, or minerals, especially\r\nfrom the Fauna and Flora of fancy. It is impossible to open a page of\r\n_Euphues_ without finding an example of this eccentric and tasteless trick,\r\nand in it, as far as in any single thing, must be found the recipe for\r\neuphuism, pure and simple. As used in modern language for conceited and\r\nprecious language in general, the term has only a very partial application\r\nto its original, or to that original's author. Indeed Lyly's vocabulary,\r\nexcept occasionally in his similes, is decidedly vernacular, and he very\r\ncommonly mingles extremely homely words with his highest flights. No better\r\nspecimen of him can be given than from the aforesaid letter commendatory to\r\nthe _Hecatompathia_.\r\n\r\n     \"My good friend, I have read your new passions, and they have\r\n     renewed mine old pleasures, the which brought to me no less\r\n     delight than they have done to your self-commendations. And\r\n     certes had not one of mine eyes about serious affairs been\r\n     watchful, both by being too busy, had been wanton: such is the\r\n     nature of persuading pleasure, that it melteth the marrow before\r\n     it scorch the skin and burneth before it warmeth. Not unlike unto\r\n     the oil of jet, which rotteth the bone and never rankleth the\r\n     flesh, or the scarab flies which enter into the root and never\r\n     touch the fruit.\r\n\r\n     \"And whereas you desire to have my opinion, you may imagine that\r\n     my stomach is rather cloyed than queasy, and therefore mine\r\n     appetite of less force than my affection, fearing rather a\r\n     surfeit of sweetness than desiring a satisfying. The repeating of\r\n     love wrought in me a semblance of liking; but searching the very\r\n     veins of my heart I could find nothing but a broad scar where I\r\n     left a deep wound: and loose strings where I tied hard knots: and\r\n     a table of steel where I framed a plot of wax.\r\n\r\n     \"Whereby I noted that young swans are grey, and the old white,\r\n     young trees tender and the old tough, young men amorous, and,\r\n     growing in years, either wiser or warier. The coral plant in the\r\n     water is a soft weed, on the land a hard stone: a sword frieth in\r\n     the fire like a black eel; but laid in earth like white snow:\r\n     the heart in love is altogether passionate; but free from desire\r\n     altogether careless.\r\n\r\n     \"But it is not my intent to inveigh against love, which women\r\n     account but a bare word and men reverence as the best God. Only\r\n     this I would add without offence to gentlewomen, that were not\r\n     men more superstitious in their praises than women are constant\r\n     in their passions love would either be worn out of use, or men\r\n     out of love, or women out of lightness. I can condemn none but by\r\n     conjecture, nor commend any but by lying, yet suspicion is as\r\n     free as thought, and as far as I can see as necessary as\r\n     credulity.\r\n\r\n     \"Touching your mistress I must needs think well, seeing you have\r\n     written so well, but as false glasses shew the fairest faces so\r\n     fine gloses amend the baddest fancies. Appelles painted the\r\n     phoenix by hearsay not by sight, and Lysippus engraved Vulcan\r\n     with a straight leg whom nature framed with a poult foot, which\r\n     proveth men to be of greater affection their [then? = than]\r\n     judgment. But in that so aptly you have varied upon women I will\r\n     not vary from you, so confess I must, and if I should not, yet\r\n     mought I be compelled, that to love would be the sweetest thing\r\n     in the earth if women were the faithfulest, and that women would\r\n     be more constant if men were more wise.\r\n\r\n     \"And seeing you have used me so friendly as to make me acquainted\r\n     with your passions, I will shortly make you privy to mine which I\r\n     would be loth the printer should see, for that my fancies being\r\n     never so crooked he would put them into straight lines unfit for\r\n     my humour, necessary for his art, who setteth down blind in as\r\n     many letters as seeing.[16]--Farewell.\"\r\n\r\n[16] \"Blinde\" with the _e_ according to the old spelling having six\r\nletters, the same number as seeing. This curious epistle is both in style\r\nand matter an epitome of _Euphues_, which had appeared some three years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nMany efforts have been made to discover some model for Lyly's oddities.\r\nSpanish and Italian influences have been alleged, and there is a special\r\ntheory that Lord Berners's translations have the credit or discredit of the\r\npaternity. The curious similes are certainly found very early in Spanish,\r\nand may be due to an Eastern origin. The habit of overloading the sentence\r\nwith elaborate and far-fetched language, especially with similes, may also\r\nhave come from the French _rhetoriqueurs_ already mentioned--a school of\r\npedantic writers (Chastellain, Robertet, Cretin, and some others being the\r\nchief) who flourished during the last half of the fifteenth century and the\r\nfirst quarter of the sixteenth, while the latest examples of them were\r\nhardly dead when Lyly was born. The desire, very laudably felt all over\r\nEurope, to adorn and exalt the vernacular tongues, so as to make them\r\nvehicles of literature worthy of taking rank with Latin and Greek,\r\nnaturally led to these follies, of which euphuism in its proper sense was\r\nonly one.\r\n\r\nMichael Drayton, in some verse complimentary to Sidney, stigmatises not\r\nmuch too strongly Lyly's prevailing faults, and attributes to the hero of\r\nZutphen the purification of England from euphuism. This is hardly critical.\r\nThat Sidney--a young man, and a man of fashion at the time when Lyly's\r\noddities were fashionable--should have to a great extent (for his\r\nresistance is by no means absolute) resisted the temptation to imitate\r\nthem, is very creditable. But the influence of _Euphues_ was at least as\r\nstrong for many years as the influence of the _Arcadia_ and the _Apology_;\r\nand the chief thing that can be said for Sidney is that he did not wholly\r\nfollow Lyly to do evil. Nor is his positive excellence in prose to be\r\ncompared for a moment with his positive excellence in poetry. His life is\r\nso universally known that nothing need be said about it beyond reminding\r\nthe reader that he was born, as Lyly is supposed to have been, in 1554;\r\nthat he was the son of Sir Henry Sidney, afterwards Viceroy of Ireland, and\r\nof Lady Mary, eldest daughter of the luckless Dudley, Duke of\r\nNorthumberland; that he was educated at Shrewsbury and Christ Church,\r\ntravelled much, acquiring the repute of one of the most accomplished\r\ncavaliers of Europe, loved without success Penelope Devereux (\"Stella\"),\r\nmarried Frances Walsingham, and died of his wounds at the battle of\r\nZutphen, when he was not yet thirty-two years old. His prose works are the\r\nfamous pastoral romance of the _Arcadia_, written to please his sister, the\r\nCountess of Pembroke, and the short _Apology for Poetry_, a very spirited\r\npiece of work, immediately provoked by a rather silly diatribe against the\r\ntheatre by one Stephen Gosson, once a playwright himself, but turned\r\nPuritan clergyman. Both appear to have been written about the same\r\ntime--that is to say, between 1579 and 1581; Sidney being then in London\r\nand in the society of Spenser and other men of letters.\r\n\r\nThe amiability of Sidney's character, his romantic history, the exquisite\r\ncharm of his verse at its best, and last, not least, the fact of his\r\nenthusiastic appreciation and patronage of literature at a time when\r\nliterary men never failed to give aristocratic patrons somewhat more than\r\n_quid pro quo_, have perhaps caused his prose work to be traditionally a\r\nlittle overvalued. The _Apology for Poetry_ is full of generous ardour,\r\ncontains many striking and poetical expressions, and explains more than any\r\nother single book the secret of the wonderful literary production of the\r\nhalf-century which followed. The _Arcadia_, especially when contrasted with\r\n_Euphues_, has the great merit of abundant and stirring incident and\r\ninterest, of freedom from any single affectation so pestering and\r\ncontinuous as Lyly's similes, and of constant purple patches of poetical\r\ndescription and expression, which are indeed not a little out of place in\r\nprose, but which are undeniably beautiful in themselves. But when this is\r\nsaid all is said. Enthusiastic as Sidney's love for poetry and for\r\nliterature was, it was enthusiasm not at all according to knowledge. In the\r\n_Apology_, by his vindication of the Unities, and his denunciation of the\r\nmixture of tragedy and comedy, he was (of course without knowing it) laying\r\ndown exactly the two principles, a fortunate abjuration and scouting\r\nwhereof gave us the greatest possession in mass and variety of merit that\r\nany literature possesses--the Elizabethan drama from Shakespere and Marlowe\r\nto Ford and Shirley. Follow Sidney, and good-bye to _Faustus_, to _Hamlet_,\r\nto _Philaster_, to _The Duchess of Malfi_, to _The Changeling_, to _The\r\nVirgin Martyr_, to _The Broken Heart_. We must content ourselves with\r\n_Gorboduc_ and _Cornelia_, with _Cleopatra_ and _Philotas_, at the very\r\nbest with _Sejanus_ and _The Silent Woman_. Again Sidney commits himself in\r\nthis same piece to the pestilent heresy of prose-poetry, saying that verse\r\nis \"only an ornament of poetry;\" nor is there any doubt that Milton,\r\nwhether he meant it or not, fixed a deserved stigma on the _Arcadia_ by\r\ncalling it a \"vain and amatorious poem.\" It is a poem in prose, which is as\r\nmuch as to say, in other words, that it unites the faults of both kinds.\r\nNor is Sidney less an enemy (though a \"sweet enemy\" in his own or Bruno's\r\nwords) of the minor and more formal graces of style. If his actual\r\nvocabulary is not Latinised, or Italianised, or Lylyfied, he was one of the\r\ngreatest of sinners in the special Elizabethan sin of convoluting and\r\nentangling his phrases (after the fashion best known in the mouths of\r\nShakespere's fine gentlemen), so as to say the simplest thing in the least\r\nsimple manner. Not Osric nor Iachimo detests the _mot propre_ more than\r\nSidney. Yet again, he is one of the arch offenders in the matter of\r\nspoiling the syntax of the sentence and the paragraph. As has been observed\r\nalready, the unpretending writers noticed above, if they have little\r\nharmony or balance of phrase, are seldom confused or breathless. Sidney was\r\none of the first writers of great popularity and influence (for the\r\n_Arcadia_ was very widely read) to introduce what may be called the\r\nsentence-and-paragraph-heap, in which clause is linked on to clause till\r\nnot merely the grammatical but the philosophical integer is hopelessly lost\r\nsight of in a tangle of jointings and appendices. It is not that he could\r\nnot do better; but that he seems to have taken no trouble not to do worse.\r\nHis youth, his numerous avocations, and the certainty that he never\r\nformally prepared any of his work for the press, would of course be ample\r\nexcuses, even if the singular and seductive beauty of many scraps\r\nthroughout this work did not redeem it. But neither of the radical\r\ndifference in nature and purpose between prose and verse, nor of the due\r\ndiscipline and management of prose itself, does Sidney seem to have had the\r\nslightest idea. Although he seldom or never reaches the beauties of the\r\n_flamboyant_ period of prose, which began soon after his death and filled\r\nthe middle of the seventeenth century, he contains examples of almost all\r\nits defects; and considering that he is nearly the first writer to do this,\r\nand that his writings were (and were deservedly) the favourite study of\r\ngenerous literary youth for more than a generation, it is scarcely\r\nuncharitable to hold him directly responsible for much mischief. The faults\r\nof _Euphues_ were faults which were certain to work their own cure; those\r\nof the _Arcadia_ were so engaging in themselves, and linked with so many\r\nmerits and beauties, that they were sure to set a dangerous example. I\r\nbelieve, indeed, that if Sidney had lived he might have pruned his style\r\nnot a little without weakening it, and then the richness of his imagination\r\nwould probably have made him the equal of Bacon and the superior of\r\nRaleigh. But as it is, his light in English prose (we shall speak and speak\r\nvery differently of his verse hereafter) was only too often a\r\nwill-o'-the-wisp. I am aware that critics whom I respect have thought and\r\nspoken in an opposite sense, but the difference comes from a more important\r\nand radical difference of opinion as to the nature, functions, and\r\nlimitations of English prose. Sidney's style may be perhaps best\r\nillustrated by part of his Dedication; the narrative parts of the _Arcadia_\r\nnot lending themselves well to brief excerpt, while the _Apology_ is less\r\nremarkable for style than for matter.\r\n\r\n     _To my dear Lady and Sister, the Countess of Pembroke._\r\n\r\n     \"Here have you now, most dear, and most worthy to be most dear,\r\n     lady, this idle work of mine; which, I fear, like the spider's\r\n     web, will be thought fitter to be swept away than wove to any\r\n     other purpose. For my part, in very truth, as the cruel fathers\r\n     among the Greeks were wont to do to the babes they would not\r\n     foster, I could well find in my heart to cast out in some desert\r\n     of forgetfulness this child which I am loth to father. But you\r\n     desired me to do it, and your desire to my heart is an absolute\r\n     commandment. Now it is done only for you, only to you; if you\r\n     keep it to yourself, or commend it to such friends who will weigh\r\n     errors in the balance of good will, I hope, for the father's\r\n     sake, it will be pardoned, perchance made much of, though in\r\n     itself it have deformities. For indeed for severer eyes it is\r\n     not, being but a trifle, and that triflingly handled. Your dear\r\n     self can best witness the manner, being done in loose sheets of\r\n     paper, most of it in your presence, the rest by sheets sent unto\r\n     you as fast as they were done. In sum, a young head, not so well\r\n     stayed as I would it were, and shall be when God will, having\r\n     many fancies begotten in it, if it had not been in some way\r\n     delivered, would have grown a monster, and more sorry might I be\r\n     that they came in than that they gat out. But his[17] chief\r\n     safety shall be the walking abroad; and his chief protection the\r\n     bearing the livery of your name, which, if much good will do not\r\n     deceive me, is worthy to be a sanctuary for a greater offender.\r\n     This say I because I know thy virtue so; and this say I because\r\n     it may be for ever so, or, to say better, because it will be for\r\n     ever so.\"\r\n\r\n[17] Apparently = the book's.\r\n\r\nThe difference referred to above is again well exemplified by the\r\ndifference of opinions on the style of Hooker as compared with that of\r\nSidney. Hooker wrote considerably later than the other authors here\r\ncriticised, but his work is so distinctly the climax of the style started\r\nby Ascham, Cheke, and their fellows (the style in which English was\r\ncarefully adapted to literary purposes for which Latin had been previously\r\nemployed, under the general idea that Latin syntax should, on the whole,\r\nrule the new literary medium), that this chapter would be incomplete\r\nwithout a notice of him. For the distinguished writers who were\r\ncontemporary with his later years represent, with rare and only partly\r\ndistinguished exceptions, not a development of Hooker, but either a\r\ndevelopment of Sidney or a fresh style, resulting from the blending in\r\ndifferent proportions of the academic and classical manner with the\r\nromantic and discursive.\r\n\r\nThe events of Hooker's neither long nor eventful life are well-known from\r\none of the earliest of standard biographies in English--that of Izaak\r\nWalton. He was born at Heavitree, a suburb of Exeter, in 1554(?). Though he\r\nwas fairly connected, his parents were poor, and he was educated as a Bible\r\nclerk at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He entered here in 1567, and for\r\nsome fifteen years Oxford was his home, latterly as Fellow and Lecturer of\r\nCorpus. The story of his marriage is slightly pathetic, but more than\r\nslightly ludicrous, and he appears to have been greatly henpecked as well\r\nas obliged to lead an uncongenial life at a country living. In 1585 he was\r\nmade Master of the Temple, and held that post for seven years,\r\ndistinguishing himself both as a preacher and a controversialist. But\r\nneither was this his vocation; and the last nine years of his life were\r\nspent, it would seem more congenially, in two other country livings, first\r\nin Wiltshire, then in Kent. He died in 1600. The first four books of the\r\n_Ecclesiastical Polity_ were published in 1594, the fifth in 1597. The last\r\nthree books, published after his death, lie under grave suspicion of having\r\nbeen tampered with. This, however, as the unquestionably genuine portion\r\nis considerable in bulk, is a matter rather of historical and theological\r\nthan of purely literary interest. Hooker himself appears to have been\r\nsomething like the popular ideal of a student: never so happy as when pen\r\nin hand, and by no means fitted for the rougher kind of converse with his\r\nfellow-men, still less for the life of what is commonly called a man of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nBut in the world of literature he is a very great man indeed. Very few\r\ntheological books have made themselves a place in the first rank of the\r\nliterature of their country, and if the _Ecclesiastical Polity_ has done\r\nso, it has certainly not done so without cause. If there has been a certain\r\ntendency on the part of strong partisans of the Anglican Church to\r\noverestimate the literary and philosophical merit of this book, which may\r\nbe called the first vernacular defence of the position of the English\r\nChurch, that has been at least compensated by partisan criticism on the\r\nother side. Nor is there the least fear that the judgment of impartial\r\ncritics will ever deprive Hooker of the high rank generally accorded to\r\nhim. He is, of course, far from being faultless. In his longer sentences\r\n(though long sentences are by no means the rule with him) he often falls\r\ninto that abuse of the classical style which the comparatively jejune\r\nwriters who had preceded him avoided, but which constantly manifested\r\nitself in the richer manner of his own contemporaries--the abuse of\r\ntreating the uninflected English language as if it were an inflected\r\nlanguage, in which variations and distinctions of case and gender and\r\nnumber help to connect adjective with substantive, and relative with\r\nantecedent. Sometimes, though less often, he distorts the natural order of\r\nthe English in order to secure the Latin desideratum of finishing with the\r\nmost emphatic and important words of the clause. His subject leads and\r\nalmost forces him to an occasional pedantry of vocabulary, and in the\r\nregion which is not quite that of form nor quite that of matter, he\r\nsometimes fails in co-ordinating his arguments, his facts, and his\r\ncitations, and in directing the whole with crushing force at his enemy. His\r\nargument occasionally degenerates into mere illustration; his logic into\r\nmere rhetoric.\r\n\r\nBut when all these things are admitted, the _Ecclesiastical Polity_ remains\r\na book in which matter and manner are wedded as in few other books of the\r\nsame kind. The one characteristic which has been admitted by Hooker's\r\nfaintest praisers as well as by his warmest--the golden moderation and\r\njudiciousness of his argument--is perhaps rather calculated to extort\r\nesteem than to arouse admiration. Moderation, like other kinds of probity,\r\n_laudatur et alget_: the adversary is not extremely grateful for not being\r\npushed to extremity, and those on the same side would at least excuse a\r\nlittle more vehemence in driving advantages home. But Hooker has other\r\nqualities which are equally estimable and more shining. What especially\r\ndistinguishes him from the literary point of view is his almost unique\r\nfaculty of diversifying dry and technical argument with outbursts of\r\nrhetoric. These last are not mere purple patches; they do not come in with\r\nthe somewhat ostentatious usherment and harbingery which, for instance,\r\nlaid the even more splendid bursts of Jeremy Taylor open to the sharp\r\nsarcasm of South. There is nothing theatrical about them; they rise quite\r\nnaturally out of the level of discussion and sink into it again, with no\r\nsudden stumble or drop. Nor are they ever (like some of Sidney's poetical\r\nexcrescences) tags and hemistichs of unwritten sonnets or songs stuck in\r\nanyhow upon the prose. For instance, Sidney writes: \"About the time when\r\nthe candles had begun to inherit the sun's office.\" Now this in a somewhat\r\nquaint and conceited fashion of verse would be excellent. It would also be\r\nexcellent in burlesque, and in such prose as Browne's it might conquer its\r\nplace victoriously. But except in such a context (which Sidney cannot\r\nweave) it is a _rococo_ ornament, a tawdry beautification. Compare with it\r\nany of the celebrated passages of Hooker, which may be found in the extract\r\nbooks--the encomium on law, the admirable passage, not so admirable indeed\r\nin the context as it might be but still admirable, about angels, the\r\nvindication of music in the church service. Here the expression, even at\r\nits warmest, is in no sense poetical, and the flight, as it is called,\r\nconnects itself with and continues and drops into the ordinary march of\r\nargument in the most natural and imperceptible manner. The elevated\r\npassages of Hooker's style resemble more than anything else those\r\nconvenient exploits common, probably, in most persons' dreams, in which the\r\ndreamer, without any trouble to himself or any apparent surprise in those\r\nabout him, lifts himself from the ground and skims or soars as he pleases,\r\nsure that he can return to earth also when he pleases, and without any\r\nshock. The speculators on the causes of beauty, admiration, and the like\r\nhave sometimes sought them in contrast first of all, and it has been\r\nfrequently noticed that the poets who charm us most are those who know how\r\nto alternate pity and terror. There is something of the same sort in these\r\nvariations of the equable procession of Hooker's syllogisms, these\r\nflower-gardens scattered, if not in the wilderness, yet in the humdrum\r\narable ground of his collections from fathers and philosophers, his\r\nmarshallings of facts and theories against the counter-theories of\r\nCartwright and Travers. Neither before him nor in his time, nor for\r\ngenerations after him--scarcely, indeed, till Berkeley--did any one arise\r\nwho had this profound and unpretentious art of mixing the useful with the\r\nagreeable. Taylor--already mentioned as inferior to Hooker in one respect,\r\nhowever superior he may be in the splendour of his rhetoric--is again and\r\nstill more inferior to him in the parts that are not ornamental, in the\r\npedestrian body of his controversy and exposition. As a mere\r\ncontroversialist, Hooker, if not exactly a Hobbes or a Bentley, if not even\r\na Chillingworth, is not likely to be spoken of without respect by those who\r\nunderstand what evidence means. If he sometimes seems to modern readers to\r\nassume his premisses, the conclusions follow much more rigidly than is\r\ncustomary with a good many of our later philosophers, who protest against\r\nthe assumption of premisses; but having so protested neglect the ambiguity\r\nof terms, and leave their middles undistributed, and perpetrate illicit\r\nprocess with a gaiety of heart which is extremely edifying, or who fancy\r\nthat they are building systems of philosophy when they are in reality\r\nconstructing dictionaries of terms. But his argument is of less concern to\r\nus here than the style in which he clothes it, and the merit of that is\r\nindisputable, as a brief extract will show.\r\n\r\n     \"As therefore man doth consist of different and distinct parts,\r\n     every part endued with manifold abilities which all have their\r\n     several ends and actions thereunto referred; so there is in this\r\n     great variety of duties which belong to men that dependency and\r\n     order by means whereof, the lower sustaining always the more\r\n     excellent and the higher perfecting the more base, they are in\r\n     their times and seasons continued with most exquisite\r\n     correspondence. Labours of bodily and daily toil purchase freedom\r\n     for actions of religious joy, which benefit these actions requite\r\n     with the gift of desired rest--a thing most natural and fit to\r\n     accompany the solemn festival duties of honour which are done to\r\n     God. For if those principal works of God, the memory whereof we\r\n     use to celebrate at such times, be but certain tastes and\r\n     says,[18] as it were, of that final benefit wherein our perfect\r\n     felicity and bliss lieth folded up, seeing that the presence of\r\n     the one doth direct our cogitations, thoughts, and desires\r\n     towards the other, it giveth surely a kind of life and addeth\r\n     inwardly no small delight to those so comfortable anticipations,\r\n     especially when the very outward countenance of that we presently\r\n     do representeth, after a sort, that also whereunto we tend. As\r\n     festival rest doth that celestial estate whereof the very\r\n     heathens themselves, which had not the means whereby to apprehend\r\n     much, did notwithstanding imagine that it must needs consist in\r\n     rest, and have therefore taught that above the highest movable\r\n     sphere there is no thing which feeleth alteration, motion, or\r\n     change; but all things immutable, unsubject to passion, blest\r\n     with eternal continuance in a life of the highest perfection, and\r\n     of that complete abundant sufficiency within itself which no\r\n     possibility of want, maim, or defect, can touch.\"\r\n\r\n[18] \"Assays.\"\r\n\r\nHooker's defects have been already admitted, and it has to be added to them\r\nthat he was necessarily destitute of much useful vocabulary which his\r\nsuccessors inherited or added, and that he had absolutely no model of\r\nstyle. What he lacked was the audacity to be, not like Sidney more flowery,\r\nnot like the contemporary pamphleteers more slangy, but more intelligently\r\nvernacular; to follow in the mould of his sentences the natural order of\r\nEnglish speech rather than the conventional syntax of Latin, and to\r\nelaborate for himself a clause-architecture or order, so to speak, of\r\nword-building, which should depend upon the inherent qualities of euphony\r\nand rhythm possessed by English. It is, however, quite certain that nothing\r\nwas further from Hooker's thoughts than the composition of English\r\nliterature merely as English literature. He wanted to bring a certain\r\nsubject under the notice of readers of the vulgar tongue, and being before\r\nall things a scholar he could not help making a scholarly use of that\r\ntongue. The wonder is that, in his circumstances and with his purposes,\r\nwith hardly any teachers, with not a great stock of verbal material, and\r\nwith little or no tradition of workmanship in the art, he should have\r\nturned out such admirable work.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to dwell on the prose of Fulke Greville, Sidney's\r\nfriend, who long outlived him, and who anticipated not a little of that\r\nmagnificence of the prose of his later contemporaries, beside which I have\r\nventured to suggest that Sidney's own is sometimes but _rococo_. A place\r\nought to be given to Richard Knolles, who deserves, if not the name of the\r\nfirst historian of England, certainly the credit of making, in his _History\r\nof the Turks_ (1604), a step from the loose miscellany of the chronicle to\r\nthe ordered structure of the true historic style. Some would plead for\r\nRichard Mulcaster, whose work on education and especially on the teaching\r\nof the English tongue in his _Positions_ and _First Part of the Elementary_\r\n(1582) is most intimately connected with our general subject. But there is\r\nno room for more than a mention of these, or for further dwelling on the\r\ntranslators already glanced at and others, the most important and\r\ninfluential of whom was John Florio, the Englisher (1603) of Montaigne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST DRAMATIC PERIOD\r\n\r\n\r\nIt does not belong to the plan of this division of the present book to\r\ntrace the earliest beginnings of the English theatre, or those intermediate\r\nperformances by which, in the reigns of the four first Tudors, the Mystery\r\nand Morality passed into the Interlude. Even the two famous comedies of\r\n_Ralph Roister Doister_ and _Gammer Gurton's Needle_ stand as it were only\r\nat the threshold of our period in this chapter, and everything before them\r\nis shut out of it. On the other hand, we can take to be our province the\r\nwhole rise, flourishing, and decadence of the extraordinary product, known\r\nsomewhat loosely as the Elizabethan drama. We shall in the present chapter\r\ndiscuss the two comedies or rather farces just mentioned, and notice on the\r\none hand the rather amorphous production which, during the first thirty\r\nyears of Elizabeth, represented the influence of a growing taste for\r\npersonal and lively dramatic story on the somewhat arid soil of the\r\nMorality and Interlude, and, on the other, the abortive attempt to\r\nintroduce the regular Senecan tragedy--an attempt which almost immediately\r\nbroke down and disappeared, whelmed in the abundance of chronicle-play and\r\nmelodrama. And finally we shall show how the two rival schools of the\r\nuniversity wits and the actor playwrights culminated, the first in Marlowe,\r\nthe second in the earlier and but indistinctly and conjecturally known work\r\nof Shakespere. A second chapter will show us the triumph of the\r\nuntrammelled English play in tragedy and comedy, furnished by Marlowe with\r\nthe mighty line, but freed to a great extent from the bombast and the\r\nunreal scheme which he did not shake off. Side by side with Shakespere\r\nhimself we shall have to deal with the learned sock of Jonson, the proud\r\nfull style of Chapman, the unchastened and ill-directed vigour of Marston,\r\nthe fresh and charming, if unkempt grace of Dekker, the best known and most\r\nremarkable members of a crowd of unknown or half-known playwrights. A third\r\ndivision will show us a slight gain on the whole in acting qualities, a\r\nconsiderable perfecting of form and scheme, but at the same time a certain\r\ndecline in the most purely poetical merits, redeemed and illustrated by the\r\nabundant genius of Beaumont and Fletcher, of Middleton, of Webster, of\r\nMassinger, and of Ford. And the two latest of these will conduct us into\r\nthe fourth or period of decadence where, round the voluminous work and\r\nstill respectable fame of James Shirley, are grouped names like Brome,\r\nGlapthorne, Suckling, and others, whose writing, sometimes remarkable and\r\neven brilliant, gradually loses not only dramatic but poetical merit, till\r\nit drops into the formless plots, the unscannable verse, the coarseness\r\nunredeemed by passion, the horrors unlit by any tragic force, which\r\ndistinguish the last plays before the closing of the theatres, and reappear\r\nto some extent at a period beyond ours in the drama (soon to be radically\r\nchanged in almost every possible characteristic) of the Restoration. The\r\nfield of survey is vast, and despite the abundant labour which has been\r\nbestowed upon it during the nineteenth century, it is still in a somewhat\r\nchaotic condition. The remarkable collection of old plays which we owe to\r\nMr. A. H. Bullen shows, by sample only and with no pretence of being\r\nexhaustive, the amount of absolutely unknown matter which still exists. The\r\ncollection and editing of texts has proceeded on the most widely different\r\nprinciples, and with an almost complete absence of that intelligent\r\npartition of labour which alone can reduce chaos to order in such a case.\r\nTo give but one instance, there is actually no complete collection, though\r\nvarious attempts have been made at it, which gives, with or without\r\nsufficient editorial apparatus to supplement the canon, all the dramatic\r\n_adespota_ which have been at one time or another attributed to Shakespere.\r\nThese at present the painful scholar can only get together in publications\r\nabounding in duplicates, edited on the most opposite principles, and\r\nequally troublesome either for library arrangement or for literary\r\nreference. The editions of single authors have exhibited an equal absence\r\nof method; one editor admitting doubtful plays or plays of part-authorship\r\nwhich are easily accessible elsewhere, while another excludes those which\r\nare difficult to be got at anywhere. It is impossible for any one who reads\r\nliterature as literature and not as a matter of idle crotchet, not to\r\nreflect that if either of the societies which, during the nineteenth\r\ncentury, have devoted themselves to the study of Shakespere and his\r\ncontemporaries, had chosen to employ their funds on it, a complete Corpus\r\nof the drama between 1560 and 1660, edited with sufficient, but not\r\nsuperfluous critical apparatus on a uniform plan, and in a decent if not a\r\nluxurious form, might now be obtainable. Some forty or fifty volumes at the\r\noutside on the scale of the \"Globe\" series, or of Messrs. Chatto's useful\r\nreprints of Jonson, Chapman, and other dramatists, would probably contain\r\nevery play of the slightest interest, even to a voracious student--who\r\nwould then have all his material under his hand. What time, expense, and\r\ntrouble are required to obtain, and that very imperfectly, any such\r\nadvantage now, only those who have tried to do it know. Even Mr. Hazlitt's\r\nwelcome, if somewhat uncritical, reprint of Dodsley, long out of print, did\r\nnot boldly carry out its principle--though there are plans for improving\r\nand supplementing it.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, if the difficulties are great so are the rewards. It has been\r\nthe deliberate opinion of many competent judges (neither unduly prejudiced\r\nin favour of English literature nor touched with that ignorance of other\r\nliterature which is as fatal to judgment as actual prejudice) that in no\r\ntime or country has the literary interest of a short and definite period of\r\nproduction in one well-defined kind approached in value the interest of the\r\nElizabethan drama. Other periods and other countries may produce more\r\nremarkable work of different kinds, or more uniformly accomplished, and\r\nmore technically excellent work in the same kind. But for originality,\r\nvolume, generic resemblance of character, and individual independence of\r\ntrait, exuberance of inventive thought, and splendour of execution in\r\ndetached passages--the Elizabethan drama from Sackville to Shirley stands\r\nalone in the history of the world. The absurd overestimate which has\r\nsometimes been made of its individual practitioners, the hyperbole of the\r\nlanguage which has been used to describe them, the puerile and almost\r\ninconceivable folly of some of their scholiasts and parasitic students,\r\nfind a certain excuse in this truth--a truth which will only be contested\r\nby those who have not taken the very considerable trouble necessary to\r\nmaster the facts, or who are precluded by a natural inability from\r\nsavouring the _gout du terroir_ of this abundant and intoxicating wine.\r\nThere are those who say that nobody but an enthusiast or a self-deceiver\r\ncan read with real relish any Elizabethan dramatist but Shakespere, and\r\nthere are those who would have it that the incommunicable and\r\nuncommunicated charm of Shakespere is to be found in Nabbes and Davenport,\r\nin Glapthorne and Chettle. They are equally wrong, but the second class are\r\nat any rate in a more saving way of wrongness. Where Shakespere stands\r\nalone is not so much in his actual faculty of poetry as in his command of\r\nthat faculty. Of the others, some, like Jonson, Fletcher, Massinger, had\r\nthe art without the power; others, like Chapman, Dekker, Webster, had\r\nflashes of the power without the art. But there is something in the whole\r\ncrew, jovial or saturnine, which is found nowhere else, and which, whether\r\nin full splendour as in Shakespere, or in occasional glimmers as in\r\nTourneur or Rowley, is found in all, save those mere imitators and\r\nhangers-on who are peculiar to no period.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable quality, however, does not show itself in the dramatic work\r\nof our present period until quite the close of it. It is true that the\r\nperiod opens (according to the traditional estimate which has not been much\r\naltered by recent studies) with three plays of very considerable character,\r\nand of no inconsiderable merit--the two comedies already named and the\r\ntragedy of _Gorboduc_, otherwise _Ferrex and Porrex_. _Ralph Roister\r\nDoister_ was licensed and is thought to have been printed in 1566, but it\r\nmay have been acted at Eton by 1541, and the whole cast of the metre,\r\nlanguage, and _scenario_, is of a colour older than Elizabeth's reign. It\r\nmay be at least attributed to the middle of the century, and is the work of\r\nNicholas Udall, a schoolmaster who has left at two great schools a repute\r\nfor indulgence in the older methods of instruction not inferior to Busby's\r\nor Keate's. _Ralph Roister Doister_, though a fanciful estimate may see a\r\nlittle cruelty of another kind in it, is of no austere or pedagogic\r\ncharacter. The author has borrowed not a little from the classical\r\ncomedy--Plautine or even Aristophanic rather than Terentian--to strengthen\r\nand refine the domestic interlude or farce; and the result is certainly\r\namusing enough. The plot turns on the courtship of Dame Christian Custance\r\n[Constance], a widow of repute and wealth as well as beauty, by the gull\r\nand coxcomb, _Ralph Roister Doister_, whose suit is at once egged on and\r\nprivately crossed by the mischievous Matthew Merrygreek, who plays not only\r\nparasite but rook to the hero. Although Custance has not the slightest\r\nintention of accepting Ralph, and at last resorts to actual violence,\r\nassisted by her maids, to get rid of him and his followers, the affair\r\nnearly breeds a serious quarrel between herself and her plighted lover,\r\nGawin Goodluck; but all ends merrily. The metre is the somewhat unformed\r\ndoggerel couplet of twelve syllables or thereabouts, with a strong caesura\r\nin the middle, and is varied and terminated by songs from Custance's maids\r\nand others. Indeed the chief charm of the piece is the genuine and unforced\r\nmerriment which pervades it. Although Merrygreek's practices on Ralph's\r\nsilliness sometimes tend a little to tediousness, the action on the whole\r\nmoves trippingly enough, and despite the strong flavour of the \"stock part\"\r\nin the characters they have considerable individuality. The play is,\r\nmoreover, as a whole remarkably free from coarseness, and there is no\r\ndifficulty in finding an illustrative extract.\r\n\r\n    _C. Custance loquitur._\r\n\r\n    \"O Lord! how necessary it is now o' days,\r\n    That each body live uprightly all manner ways;\r\n    For let never so little a gap be open,\r\n    And be sure of this, the worst shall be spoken.\r\n    How innocent stand I in this frame o' thought,\r\n    And yet see what mistrust towards me it hath wrought.\r\n    But thou, Lord, knowest all folks' thoughts and eke intents;\r\n    And thou art the deliverer of all innocents.\r\n    Thou didst keep the advoutress,[19] that she might be amended;\r\n    Much more then keep, Lord,[20] that never sin intended.\r\n    Thou didst keep Susanna, wrongfully accused,\r\n    And no less dost thou see, Lord, how I am now abused.\r\n    Thou didst keep Hester, when she should have died,\r\n    Keep also, good Lord, that my truth may be tried.\r\n    Yet, if Gawin Goodluck with Tristram Trusty speak,\r\n    I trust of ill-report the force shall be but weak;\r\n    And lo! yond they come talking sadly together:\r\n    I will abide, and not shrink for their coming hither.\"\r\n\r\n[19] Adulteress.\r\n\r\n[20] Understand \"me.\"\r\n\r\nFreedom from coarseness is more than can be predicated of the still more\r\nfamous _Gammer Gurton's Needle_, attributed to, and all but certainly known\r\nto be, by John Still, afterwards bishop. The authorship, indeed, is not\r\nquite certain; and the curious reference in Martin Marprelate's _Epistle_\r\n(ed. Arber, p. 11) to \"this trifle\" as \"shewing the author to have had some\r\nwit and invention in him\" only disputes the claim of Dr. Bridges to those\r\nqualities, and does not make any suggestion as to the identity of the more\r\nfavoured author. Still was the son of a Lincolnshire gentleman, is supposed\r\nto have been born about 1543, was educated at Christ's College, Cambridge,\r\nand after a course of preferment through the positions of parish priest in\r\nLondon and at Hadleigh, Dean of Bocking, Canon of Westminster, Master\r\nsuccessively of St. John's and Trinity, and Vice-Chancellor of his own\r\nUniversity, was at the beginning of 1593 made Bishop of Bath and Wells, an\r\noffice which he held for fifteen years. His play (taking it as his) was his\r\nonly work of the kind, and was the first English play acted at either\r\nuniversity, though later he himself had to protest officially against the\r\nuse of the vernacular in a piece performed before the Queen. _Gammer\r\nGurton's Needle_, as has been said, is, despite the subsequent history of\r\nits author and the academic character of its appearance, of a much lower\r\norder of comedy than _Ralph Roister Doister_, though it is also more\r\nspontaneous, less imitative, and, in short, more original. The best thing\r\nabout it is the magnificent drinking song, \"Back and Side go Bare, go\r\nBare,\" one of the most spirited and genuine of all bacchanalian lyrics; but\r\nthe credit of this has sometimes been denied to Still. The metre of the\r\nplay itself is very similar to that of _Ralph Roister Doister_, though the\r\nlong swinging couplet has a tendency to lengthen itself still further, to\r\nthe value of fourteen or even sixteen syllables, the central caesura being\r\nalways well marked, as may be seen in the following:--\r\n\r\n    _Diccon._ \"Here will the sport begin, if these two once may meet,\r\n              Their cheer, [I] durst lay money, will prove scarcely sweet.\r\n              My gammer sure intends to be upon her bones,\r\n              With staves, or with clubs, or else with cobble stones.\r\n              Dame Chat on the other side, if she be far behind,\r\n              I am right far deceived, she is given to it of kind.\r\n              He that may tarry by it a while, and that but short,\r\n              I warrant him trust to it, he shall see all the sport.\r\n              Into the town will I, my friends to visit there,\r\n              And hither straight again to see the end of this gear.\r\n              In the meantime, fellows, pipe up your fiddles; I say, take\r\n                    them,\r\n              And let your friends hear such mirth as ye can make them.\"\r\n\r\nAs for the story, it is of the simplest, turning merely on the losing of\r\nher needle by Gammer Gurton as she was mending her man Hodge's breeches, on\r\nthe search for it by the household, on the tricks by which Diccon the\r\nBedlam (the clown or \"vice\" of the piece) induces a quarrel between Gammer\r\nand her neighbours, and on the final finding of the needle in the exact\r\nplace on which Gammer Gurton's industry had been employed. The action is\r\neven better sustained and livelier than in Udall's play, and the swinging\r\ncouplets canter along very cheerfully with great freedom and fluency of\r\nlanguage. Unfortunately this language, whether in order to raise a laugh or\r\nto be in strict character with the personages, is anything but choice.\r\nThere is (barring a possible double meaning or two) nothing of the kind\r\ngenerally known as licentious; it is the merely foul and dirty language of\r\ncommon folk at all times, introduced, not with humorous extravagance in the\r\nRabelaisian fashion, but with literal realism. If there had been a little\r\nless of this, the piece would have been much improved; but even as it is,\r\nit is a capital example of farce, just as _Ralph Roister Doister_ is of a\r\nrather rudimentary kind of regular comedy.\r\n\r\nThe strangeness of the contrast which these two plays offer when compared\r\nwith the third is peculiar in English literature. Elsewhere it is common\r\nenough. That tragedy should be stately, decorous, and on the whole somewhat\r\nuneventful as far as visible action goes,--comedy bustling, crammed with\r\nincident, and quite regardless of decorum,--might seem a law of nature to\r\nthe audience of AEschylus and Aristophanes, of Plautus and Pacuvius, even to\r\nthe audience of Moliere and Racine. But the vast and final change, the\r\ninception of which we have here to record, has made tragedy, tragi-comedy,\r\ncomedy, and farce pass into one another so gradually, and with so little of\r\na break in the English mind, that _Gammer Gurton's Needle_ and _Gorboduc_,\r\nthough they were presented to the same audiences, and in all probability\r\nwritten within ten years of each other at furthest, seem to belong to\r\ndifferent worlds of literature and society. The two comedies just noticed\r\nare framed upon no literary model at all as wholes, but simply upon the\r\nmodel of human nature. _Gorboduc_ is framed, though not with absolute\r\nfidelity, on the model of the tragedies of Seneca, which had, during the\r\nearly years of the sixteenth century, mastered the attention of the\r\nliterary playwrights of Italy, France, and even to some extent Germany, and\r\nwhich determined for three hundred years, at any rate, the form of the\r\ntragedy of France. This model--which may be briefly described as the model\r\nof Greek tragedy, still further pruned of action, with the choruses\r\nretained, but estranged from their old close connection with the dialogue,\r\nand reduced to the level of elaborate lyrical moralisings, and with the\r\ntendency to such moralising in dialogue as well as in chorus largely\r\nincreased--was introduced in England with hardly less advantage than\r\nabroad. Sackville, one of the reputed authors of _Gorboduc_, was far\r\nsuperior to Jodelle, both as poet and as versifier, and the existence of\r\nthe two universities in England gave a support, to which nothing in France\r\ncorresponded, to the influence of learned writers. Indeed, till nearly the\r\nclose of our present period, the universities had the practical control of\r\nliterary production. But the genius of the English nation would have none\r\nof Seneca. It refused him when he was first introduced by Sackville and\r\nothers; it refused him once more when Daniel and the set of the Countess of\r\nPembroke again attempted to introduce him; it refused him again and again\r\nin the later seventeenth century, when imitation, first of his earlier\r\nFrench followers, and then of the greater tragedy of Corneille and Racine\r\n(which was only the Senecan model strengthened and improved) was repeatedly\r\ntried by fine gentlemen and by needy hacks, by devotees of the unities, and\r\nby devotees of court fashion. I hardly know any other instance in literary\r\nhistory of a similar resistance offered to a similar tide of literary\r\ninfluence in Europe. We have little room here for fanciful comparisons, yet\r\nmight the dramatic events of 1560-1590 in England well seem a literary\r\nbattle of Tours, in which an English Charles Martel stemmed and turned back\r\nfor ever and ever the hitherto resistless march of a literary invader and\r\nspread of a literary heresy.\r\n\r\nTo the modern reader _Gorboduc_ (part of which is attributed to Thomas\r\nNorton, and which was acted on 18th January 1561, published piratically in\r\n1565, and authoritatively under the title of _Ferrex and Porrex_ in 1571?)\r\nis scarcely inviting, but that is not a criterion of its attractiveness to\r\nits own contemporaries. Perhaps the most curious thing about it is the\r\nviolence done to the Horatian and Senecan theories, or rather the _naif_\r\noutwitting of those theories, by an arrangement of dumb shows between the\r\nacts to satisfy the hunger for real action which the model refused to\r\ncountenance. All the rest is of the most painful regularity: and the\r\nscrupulosity with which each of the rival princes is provided with a\r\ncounsellor and a parasite to himself, and the other parts are allotted with\r\nsimilar fairness, reaches such a point that it is rather surprising that\r\nGorboduc was not provided with two queens--a good and a bad. Such action as\r\nthere is lies wholly in the mouths of messengers, and the speeches are of\r\nexcessive length. But even these faults are perhaps less trying to the\r\nmodern reader than the inchoate and unpolished condition of the metre in\r\nthe choruses, and indeed in the blank verse dialogue. Here and there, there\r\nare signs of the stateliness and poetical imagery of the \"Induction\"; but\r\nfor the most part the decasyllables stop dead at their close and begin\r\nafresh at their beginning with a staccato movement and a dull monotony of\r\ncadence which is inexpressibly tedious, as will be seen in the following:--\r\n\r\n    (_Videna soliloquises._)\r\n\r\n    \"Why should I live and linger forth my time\r\n    In longer life to double my distress?\r\n    O me, most woeful wight, whom no mishap\r\n    Long ere this day could have bereaved hence.\r\n    Might not these hands, by fortune or by fate,\r\n    Have pierc'd this breast, and life with iron reft?\r\n    Or in this palace here where I so long\r\n    Have spent my days, could not that happy hour\r\n    Once, once have happ'd in which these hugy frames\r\n    With death by fall might have oppressed me?\r\n    Or should not this most hard and cruel soil,\r\n    So oft where I have press'd my wretched steps,\r\n    Some time had ruth of mine accursed life,\r\n    To rend in twain and swallow me therein?\r\n    So had my bones possessed now in peace\r\n    Their happy grave within the closed ground,\r\n    And greedy worms had gnawn this pined heart\r\n    Without my feeling pain: so should not now\r\n    This living breast remain the ruthful tomb\r\n    Wherein my heart yielden to death is graved;\r\n    Nor dreary thoughts, with pangs of pining grief,\r\n    My doleful mind had not afflicted thus.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no blame due to Sackville in that he did not invent what no single\r\nman invented, and what even in England, where only it has been originally\r\nattained, took some thirty years of the genius of the nation working\r\nthrough innumerable individual tentatives and failures to bring about. But\r\nhe did not invent it; he did not even make any attempt to invent it; and\r\nhad this first English tragedy been generally followed, we should have been\r\nfor an unknown period in the land of bondage, in the classical dungeon\r\nwhich so long retained the writers of a nation, certainly not, at the time\r\nof the appearance of _Gorboduc_, of less literary promise than our own.\r\n\r\nIn describing these tentatives and failures it will be impossible here to\r\nenter into any lengthened criticism of particular works. We shall have to\r\ncontent ourselves with a description of the general lines and groups, which\r\nmay be said to be four in number: (1) The few unimportant and failing\r\nfollowers of Sackville; (2) The miscellaneous farce-and-interlude-writers,\r\nwho, incult and formless as their work was, at least maintained the\r\nliterary tradition; (3) The important and most interesting group of\r\n\"university wits\" who, with Marlowe at their head, made the blank verse\r\nline for dramatic purposes, dismissed, cultivated as they were, the\r\ncultivation of classical models, and gave English tragedy its Magna Charta\r\nof freedom and submission to the restrictions of actual life only, but who\r\nfailed, from this cause or that, to achieve perfect life-likeness; and (4)\r\nThe actor-playwrights who, rising from very humble beginnings, but\r\npossessing in their fellow Shakespere a champion unparalleled in ancient\r\nand modern times, borrowed the improvements of the University Wits, added\r\ntheir own stage knowledge, and with Shakespere's aid achieved the master\r\ndrama of the world.\r\n\r\nA very few lines will suffice for the first group, who are the merest\r\nliterary curiosities. Indeed the actual number of Senecan dramas in English\r\nis very small indeed, though there may possibly be some undiscovered in MS.\r\nThe _Tancred and Gismund_ of Robert Wilmot (acted 1568, and of some merit),\r\nthe _Cornelia_ of Garnier, translated by Kyd and printed in 1594, the\r\ncurious play called _The Misfortunes of Arthur_, acted before the Queen in\r\nthe Armada year, with \"triumphs\" partly devised by Francis Bacon, the two\r\nplays of Samuel Daniel, and a very few others, complete the list; indeed\r\n_Cornelia_, _Cleopatra_, and _Philotas_ are almost the only three that keep\r\nreally close to the model. At a time of such unbounded respect for the\r\nclassics, and when Latin plays of the same stamp were constantly acted at\r\nthe universities, such a paucity of examples in English can only testify to\r\na strong national distaste--an instinctive feeling that this would never\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nThe nondescript followings of morality and farce are infinitely more\r\nnumerous, and perhaps intrinsically more interesting; but they can hardly\r\nbe said to be, except in bulk, of much greater importance. Their real\r\ninterest to the reader as he turns them over in the first seven or eight\r\nvolumes of Dodsley, or in the rarer single editions where they occur, is\r\nagain an interest of curiosity--a desire to trace the various shiftings and\r\nturnings of the mighty but unorganised genius which was soon to find its\r\nway. Next to the difficulty of inventing a conveniently plastic form seems\r\nto have been the difficulty of inventing a suitable verse. For some time\r\nthe swinging or lumbering doggerel in which a tolerably good rhyme is\r\nreached by a kind of scramble through four or five feet, which are most\r\nlike a very shuffling anapaest--the verse which appears in the comedies of\r\nUdall and Still--held its ground. We have it in the morality of the _New\r\nCustom_, printed in 1573, but no doubt written earlier, in the Interlude\r\nof _The Trial of Treasure_, in the farcical comedy of _Like Will to Like_,\r\na coarse but lively piece, by Ulpian Fulwell (1568). In the very curious\r\ntragi-comedy of _Cambyses_ this doggerel appears partly, but is alternated\r\nwith the less lawless but scarcely more suitable \"fourteener\" (divided or\r\nnot as usual, according to printer's exigencies) which, as was shown in the\r\nlast chapter, for a time almost monopolised the attention of English poets.\r\nThe same mixture appears to some extent, though the doggerel occupies the\r\nmain text, in the _Damon and Pythias_ of Richard Edwards, the editor of\r\n_The Paradise of Dainty Devices_. In _Appius and Virginia_ (a decidedly\r\ninteresting play) the fourteener on the contrary is the staple verse, the\r\ndoggerel being only occasional. Something the same may be said of a very\r\nlate morality, _The Conflict of Conscience_. Both doggerel and fourteeners\r\nappear in the quaint productions called _Three Ladies of London_, etc.; but\r\nby this time the decasyllable began to appear with them and to edge them\r\nout. They died hard, however, thoroughly ill-fitted as they were for\r\ndramatic use, and, as readers of _Love's Labour Lost_ know, survived even\r\nin the early plays of Shakespere. Nor were the characters and minor details\r\ngenerally of this group less disorderly and inadequate than the general\r\nschemes or the versification. Here we have the abstractions of the old\r\nMorality; there the farcical gossip of the _Gammer Gurton's Needle_ class;\r\nelsewhere the pale and dignified personages of _Gorboduc_: all three being\r\noften jumbled together all in one play. In the lighter parts there are\r\nsometimes fair touches of low comedy; in the graver occasionally, though\r\nmuch more rarely, a touching or dignified phrase or two. But the plays as\r\nwholes are like Ovid's first-fruits of the deluge--nondescripts incapable\r\nof life, and good for no useful or ornamental purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is at this moment that the cleavage takes place. And when I say \"this\r\nmoment,\" I am perfectly conscious that the exact moment in dates and years\r\ncannot be defined. Not a little harm has been done to the history of\r\nEnglish literature by the confusion of times in which some of its\r\nhistorians have pleased themselves. But even greater harm might be done if\r\none were to insist on an exact chronology for the efflorescence of the\r\nreally poetical era of Elizabethan literature, if the blossoming of the\r\naloe were to be tied down to hour and day. All that we can say is that in\r\ncertain publications, in certain passages even of the same publication, we\r\nfind the old respectable plodding, the old blind tentative experiment in\r\npoetry and drama: and then without warning--without, as it seems, any\r\npossible opportunity of distinguishing chronologically--we find the\r\nunmistakable marks of the new wine, of the unapproachable poetry proper,\r\nwhich all criticism, all rationalisation can only indicate and not account\r\nfor. We have hardly left (if we take their counterparts later we have not\r\nleft) the wooden verse of _Gorboduc_, the childish rusticity of _Like Will\r\nto Like_, when suddenly we stumble on the bower--\r\n\r\n    \"Seated in hearing of a hundred streams\"--\r\n\r\nof George Peele, on the myriad graceful fancies of Lyly, on the exquisite\r\nsnatches of Greene, on the verses, to this day the high-water mark of\r\npoetry, in which Marlowe speaks of the inexpressible beauty which is the\r\nobject and the despair of the poet. This is wonderful enough. But what is\r\nmore wonderful is, that these lightning flashes are as evanescent as\r\nlightning. Lyly, Peele, Greene, Marlowe himself, in probably the very next\r\npassages, certainly in passages not very remote, tell us that this is all\r\nmatter of chance, that they are all capable of sinking below the level of\r\nSackville at his even conceivably worst, close to the level of Edwards, and\r\nthe various anonymous or half-anonymous writers of the dramatic\r\nmiscellanies just noted. And then beyond these unequal wits arises the\r\nfigure of Shakespere; and the greatest work of all literature swims slowly\r\ninto our ken. There has been as yet no history of this unique phenomenon\r\nworthy of it: I have not the least pretension to supply one that shall be\r\nworthy. But at least the uniqueness of it shall here have due celebration.\r\nThe age of Pericles, the age of Augustus, the age of Dante, had no such\r\ncurious ushering-in unless time has dealt exceptional injustice to the\r\nforerunners of all of them. We do not, in the period which comes nearest in\r\ntime and nature to this, see anything of the same kind in the middle space\r\nbetween Villon and Ronsard, between Agrippa d'Aubigne and Corneille. Here\r\nif anywhere is the concentrated spirit of a nation, the thrice-decocted\r\nblood of a people, forcing itself into literary expression through mediums\r\nmore and more worthy of it. If ever the historical method was justified (as\r\nit always is), now is its greatest justification as we watch the gradual\r\nimprovements, the decade-by-decade, almost year-by-year acquisitions, which\r\nlead from Sackville to Shakespere.\r\n\r\nThe rising sap showed itself in two very different ways, in two branches of\r\nthe national tree. In the first place, we have the group of University\r\nWits, the strenuous if not always wise band of professed men of letters, at\r\nthe head of whom are Lyly, Marlowe, Greene, Peele, Lodge, Nash, and\r\nprobably (for his connection with the universities is not certainly known)\r\nKyd. In the second, we have the irregular band of outsiders, players and\r\nothers, who felt themselves forced into literary and principally dramatic\r\ncomposition, who boast Shakespere as their chief, and who can claim as\r\nseconds to him not merely the imperfect talents of Chettle, Munday, and\r\nothers whom we may mention in this chapter, but many of the perfected\r\nornaments of a later time.\r\n\r\nIt may be accident or it may not, but the beginning of this period is\r\ncertainly due to the \"university wits.\" Lyly stands a good deal apart from\r\nthem personally, despite his close literary connection. We have no kind of\r\nevidence which even shows that he was personally acquainted with any one of\r\nthe others. Of Kyd, till Mr. Boas's recent researches, we knew next to\r\nnothing, and we still know very little save that he was at Merchant\r\nTaylors' School and was busy with plays famous in their day. But the other\r\nfive were closely connected in life, and in their deaths they were hardly\r\ndivided. Lodge only of the five seems to have freed himself, partly in\r\nvirtue of a regular profession, and partly in consequence of his adherence\r\nto the Roman faith, from the Bohemianism which has tempted men of letters\r\nat all times, and which was especially dangerous in a time of such\r\nunlimited adventure, such loose public morals, and such unco-ordinated\r\nsociety as the Elizabethan era. Whatever details we have of their lives\r\n(and they are mostly very meagre and uncertain) convey the idea of times\r\nout of joint or not yet in joint. The atheism of Marlowe rests on no proof\r\nwhatever, though it has got him friends in this later time. I am myself by\r\nno means sure that Greene's supposed debauchery is not, to a great extent,\r\n\"copy.\" The majority of the too celebrated \"jests\" attributed to George\r\nPeele are directly traceable to Villon's _Repues Franches_ and similar\r\ncompilations, and have a suspiciously mythical and traditional air to the\r\nstudent of literary history. There is something a little more trustworthily\r\nautobiographical about Nash. But on the whole, though we need not doubt\r\nthat these ancestors of all modern Englishmen who live by the gray goose\r\nquill tasted the inconveniences of the profession, especially at a time\r\nwhen it was barely constituted even as a vocation or employment (to quote\r\nthe Income Tax Papers), we must carefully avoid taking too gloomy a view of\r\ntheir life. It was usually short, it was probably merry, but we know very\r\nlittle else about it. The chief direct documents, the remarkable pamphlets\r\nwhich some of them have left, will be dealt with hereafter. Here we are\r\nbusied only with their dates and their dramatic work, which was in no case\r\n(except perhaps in that of Kyd) their sole known work, but which in every\r\ncase except those of Nash and perhaps Greene was their most remarkable.\r\n\r\nIn noticing _Euphues_ an account has already been given of Lyly's life, or\r\nrather of the very scanty particulars which are known of it. His plays date\r\nconsiderably later than _Euphues_. But they all bear the character of the\r\ncourtier about them; and both in this characteristic and in the absence of\r\nany details in the gossipping literature of the time to connect him with\r\nthe Bohemian society of the playhouse, the distinction which separates Lyly\r\nfrom the group of \"university wits\" is noteworthy. He lost as well as\r\ngained by the separation. All his plays were acted \"by the children of\r\nPaul's before her Majesty,\" and not by the usual companies before Dick,\r\nTom, and Harry. The exact date and order of their writing is very\r\nuncertain, and in one case at least, that of _The Woman in the Moon_, we\r\nknow that the order was exactly reversed in publication: this being the\r\nlast printed in Lyly's lifetime, and expressly described as the first\r\nwritten. His other dramatic works are _Campaspe_, _Sappho and Phaon_,\r\n_Endymion_, _Galathea_, _Midas_, _Mother Bombie_, and _Love's\r\nMetamorphosis_; another, _The Maid's Metamorphosis_, which has been\r\nattributed to him, is in all probability not his.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar circumstances of the production of Lyly's plays, and the\r\nstrong or at any rate decided individuality of the author, keep them in a\r\ndivision almost to themselves. The mythological or pastoral character of\r\ntheir subject in most cases might not of itself have prevented their\r\nmarking an advance in the dramatic composition of English playwrights. _A\r\nMidsummer Night's Dream_ and much other work of Shakespere's show how far\r\nfrom necessary it is that theme, or class of subject, should affect merit\r\nof presentment. But Lyly's work generally has more of the masque than the\r\nplay. It sometimes includes charming lyrics, such as the famous _Campaspe_\r\nsong and others. But most of it is in prose, and it gave beyond\r\ndoubt--though Gascoigne had, as we have seen, set the example in drama--no\r\nsmall impetus to the use and perfectioning of that medium. For Lyly's\r\ndramatic prose, though sometimes showing the same faults, is often better\r\nthan _Euphues_, as here:--\r\n\r\n     _End._ \"O fair Cynthia, why do others term thee unconstant, whom\r\n     I have ever found immovable? Injurious time, corrupt manners,\r\n     unkind men, who finding a constancy not to be matched in my sweet\r\n     mistress, have christened her with the name of wavering, waxing,\r\n     and waning. Is she inconstant that keepeth a settled course,\r\n     which since her first creation altereth not one minute in her\r\n     moving? There is nothing thought more admirable, or commendable\r\n     in the sea, than the ebbing and flowing; and shall the moon, from\r\n     whom the sea taketh this virtue, be accounted fickle for\r\n     increasing and decreasing? Flowers in their buds are nothing\r\n     worth till they be blown; nor blossoms accounted till they be\r\n     ripe fruit; and shall we then say they be changeable, for that\r\n     they grow from seeds to leaves, from leaves to buds, from buds to\r\n     their perfection? then, why be not twigs that become trees,\r\n     children that become men, and mornings that grow to evenings,\r\n     termed wavering, for that they continue not at one stay? Ay, but\r\n     Cynthia being in her fulness decayeth, as not delighting in her\r\n     greatest beauty, or withering when she should be most honoured.\r\n     When malice cannot object anything, folly will; making that a\r\n     vice which is the greatest virtue. What thing (my mistress\r\n     excepted) being in the pride of her beauty, and latter minute of\r\n     her age, that waxeth young again? Tell me, Eumenides, what is he\r\n     that having a mistress of ripe years, and infinite virtues, great\r\n     honours, and unspeakable beauty, but would wish that she might\r\n     grow tender again? getting youth by years, and never-decaying\r\n     beauty by time; whose fair face, neither the summer's blaze can\r\n     scorch, nor winter's blast chap, nor the numbering of years breed\r\n     altering of colours. Such is my sweet Cynthia, whom time cannot\r\n     touch, because she is divine, nor will offend because she is\r\n     delicate. O Cynthia, if thou shouldest always continue at thy\r\n     fulness, both gods and men would conspire to ravish thee. But\r\n     thou, to abate the pride of our affections, dost detract from thy\r\n     perfections; thinking it sufficient if once in a month we enjoy a\r\n     glimpse of thy majesty; and then, to increase our griefs, thou\r\n     dost decrease thy gleams; coming out of thy royal robes,\r\n     wherewith thou dazzlest our eyes, down into thy swath clouts,\r\n     beguiling our eyes; and then----\"\r\n\r\nIn these plays there are excellent phrases and even striking scenes. But\r\nthey are not in the true sense dramatic, and are constantly spoilt by\r\nLyly's strange weakness for conceited style. Everybody speaks in\r\nantitheses, and the intolerable fancy similes, drawn from a kind of\r\nimaginary natural history, are sometimes as prominent as in _Euphues_\r\nitself. Lyly's theatre represents, in short, a mere backwater in the\r\ngeneral stream of dramatic progress, though not a few allusions in other\r\nmen's work show us that it attracted no small attention. With Nash alone,\r\nof the University Wits proper, was Lyly connected, and this only\r\nproblematically. He was an Oxford man, and most of them were of Cambridge;\r\nhe was a courtier; if a badly-paid one, and they all lived by their wits;\r\nand, if we may judge by the very few documents remaining, he was not\r\ninclined to be hail-fellow-well-met with anybody, while they were all born\r\nBohemians. Yet none of them had a greater influence on Shakespere than\r\nLyly, though it was anything but a beneficial influence, and for this as\r\nwell as for the originality of his production he deserves notice, even had\r\nthe intrinsic merit of his work been less than it is. But, in fact, it is\r\nvery great, being almost a typical production of talent helped by\r\nknowledge, but not mastered by positive genius, or directed in its way by\r\nthe precedent work of others.\r\n\r\nIn the work of the University Wits proper--Marlowe, Greene, Peele, Lodge,\r\nNash, and Kyd, the last of whom, it must again be said, is not certainly\r\nknown to have belonged to either university, though the probabilities are\r\nall in favour of that hypothesis--a very different kind of work is found.\r\nIt is always faulty, as a whole, for even _Dr. Faustus_ and _Edward II._,\r\ndespite their magnificent poetry and the vast capabilities of their form,\r\ncould only be called good plays or good compositions as any kind of whole\r\nby a critic who had entirely lost the sense of proportion. But in the whole\r\ngroup, and especially in the dramatic work of Marlowe, Greene, Peele, and\r\nKyd (for that of Lodge and Nash is small in amount and comparatively\r\nunimportant in manner), the presence, the throes of a new dramatic style\r\nare evident. Faults and beauties are more or less common to the whole\r\nquartet. In all we find the many-sided activity of the Shakesperian drama\r\nas it was to be, sprawling and struggling in a kind of swaddling clothes of\r\nwhich it cannot get rid, and which hamper and cripple its movements. In all\r\nthere is present a most extraordinary and unique rant and bombast of\r\nexpression which reminds one of the shrieks and yells of a band of healthy\r\nboys just let out to play. The passages which (thanks chiefly to Pistol's\r\nincomparable quotations and parodies of them) are known to every one, the\r\n\"Pampered jades of Asia,\" the \"Have we not Hiren here,\" the \"Feed and grow\r\nfat, my fair Callipolis,\" the other quips and cranks of mine ancient are\r\nscattered broadcast in their originals, and are evidently meant quite\r\nseriously throughout the work of these poets. Side by side with this mania\r\nfor bombast is another mania, much more clearly traceable to education and\r\nassociations, but specially odd in connection with what has just been\r\nnoticed. This is the foible of classical allusion. The heathen gods and\r\ngoddesses, the localities of Greek and Roman poetry, even the more\r\nout-of-the-way commonplaces of classical literature, are put in the mouths\r\nof all the characters without the remotest attempt to consider propriety or\r\nrelevance. Even in still lesser peculiarities the blemishes are uniform and\r\nconstant--such as the curious and childish habit of making speakers speak\r\nof themselves in the third person, and by their names, instead of using \"I\"\r\nand \"me.\" And on the other hand, the merits, though less evenly distributed\r\nin degree, are equally constant in kind. In Kyd, in Greene still more, in\r\nPeele more still, in Marlowe most of all, phrases and passages of blinding\r\nand dazzling poetry flash out of the midst of the bombast and the tedium.\r\nMany of these are known, by the hundred books of extract which have\r\nfollowed Lamb's _Specimens_, to all readers. Such, for instance, is the\r\n\r\n    \"See where Christ's blood streams in the firmament\"\r\n\r\nof Marlowe, and his even more magnificent passage beginning\r\n\r\n    \"If all the pens that ever poets held;\"\r\n\r\nsuch Peele's exquisite bower,\r\n\r\n    \"Seated in hearing of a hundred streams,\"\r\n\r\nwhich is, with all respect to Charles Lamb, to be paralleled by a score of\r\nother jewels from the reckless work of \"George Pyeboard\": such Greene's\r\n\r\n    \"Why thinks King Henry's son that Margaret's love\r\n    Hangs in the uncertain balance of proud time?\"\r\n\r\nsuch even Kyd's\r\n\r\n    \"There is a path upon your left hand side\r\n    That leadeth from a guilty conscience\r\n    Unto a forest of distrust and fear.\"\r\n\r\nBut the whole point of the thing is that these flashes, which are not to be\r\nfound at all before the date of this university school, are to be found\r\nconstantly in its productions, and that, amorphous, inartistic, incomplete\r\nas those productions are, they still show _Hamlet_ and _A Midsummer Night's\r\nDream_ in embryo. Whereas the greatest expert in literary embryology may\r\nread _Gorboduc_ and _The Misfortunes of Arthur_ through without discerning\r\nthe slightest signs of what was coming.\r\n\r\nNash and Lodge are so little dramatists (the chief, if not only play of the\r\nformer being the shapeless and rather dull comedy, _Will Summer's\r\nTestament_, relieved only by some lyrics of merit which are probably not\r\nNash's, while Lodge's _Marius and Sylla_, while it wants the extravagance,\r\nwants also the beauty of its author's companions' work), that what has to\r\nbe said about them will be better said later in dealing with their other\r\nbooks. Greene's prose pieces and his occasional poems are, no doubt, better\r\nthan his drama, but the latter is considerable, and was probably his\r\nearliest work. Kyd has left nothing, and Peele little, but drama; while\r\nbeautiful as Marlowe's _Hero and Leander_ is, I do not quite understand how\r\nany one can prefer it to the faultier but far more original dramas of its\r\nauthor. We shall therefore deal with these four individually here.\r\n\r\nThe eldest of the four was George Peele, variously described as a Londoner\r\nand a Devonshire man, who was probably born about 1558. He was educated at\r\nChrist's Hospital (of which his father was \"clerk\") and at Broadgates Hall,\r\nnow Pembroke College, Oxford, and had some credit in the university as an\r\narranger of pageants, etc. He is supposed to have left Oxford for London\r\nabout 1581, and had the credit of living a Bohemian, not to say\r\ndisreputable, life for about seventeen years; his death in 1597(?) being\r\nnot more creditable than his life. But even the scandals about Peele are\r\nmuch more shadowy than those about Marlowe and Greene. His dramatic work\r\nconsists of some half-dozen plays, the earliest of which is _The\r\nArraignment of Paris_, 1581(?), one of the most elaborate and barefaced of\r\nthe many contemporary flatteries of Elizabeth, but containing some\r\nexquisite verse. In the same way Peele has been accused of having in\r\n_Edward I._ adopted or perhaps even invented the basest and most groundless\r\nscandals against the noble and stainless memory of Eleanor of Castile;\r\nwhile in his _Battle of Alcazar_ he certainly gratifies to the utmost the\r\npopular anti-Spanish and anti-Popish feeling. So angry have critics been\r\nwith Peele's outrage on Eleanor, that some of them have declared that none\r\nbut he could have been guilty of the not dissimilar slur cast on Joan of\r\nArc's character in _Henry VI._, the three parts of which it has been the\r\ngood pleasure of Shakesperian commentators to cut and carve between the\r\nUniversity Wits _ad libitum_. I cannot myself help thinking that all this\r\nhas arisen very much from the idea of Peele's vagabondism given by the\r\nuntrustworthy \"Jests.\" The slander on Queen Eleanor was pretty certainly\r\nsupplied to him by an older ballad. There is little or nothing else in\r\nPeele's undoubted writings which is at all discreditable. His miscellaneous\r\npoems show a man by no means given to low company or low thoughts, and one\r\ngifted with the truest poetic vein; while his dramas, besides exhibiting a\r\ngreater command over blank verse than any of his predecessors and than any\r\nexcept Marlowe of his contemporaries can claim, are full of charming\r\npassages. _Sir Clyomon and Sir Clamydes_, which has been denied to him--an\r\ninteresting play on the rare basis of the old romance--is written not in\r\nblank verse but in the fourteener. The _Old Wives' Tale_ pretty certainly\r\nfurnished Milton with the subject of Comus, and this is its chief merit.\r\n_Edward I._ and _The Battle of Alcazar_, but especially the latter, contain\r\nabundance of the hectoring rant which has been marked as one of the\r\ncharacteristics of the school, and which is half-excused by the sparks of\r\nvalour that often break from its smoke and clatter. But Peele would\r\nundoubtedly stand higher, though he might not be so interesting a literary\r\nfigure, if we had nothing of his save _The Arraignment of Paris_ and _David\r\nand Bethsabe_. _The Arraignment_ (written in various metres, but mainly in\r\na musical and varied heroic couplet), is partly a pastoral, partly a\r\nmasque, and wholly a Court play. It thus comes nearest to Lyly, but is\r\naltogether a more dramatic, livelier, and less conceited performance than\r\nanything by the author of _Euphues_. As for _David and Bethsabe_, it is\r\ncrammed with beauties, and Lamb's curiously faint praise of it has always\r\nbeen a puzzle to me. As Marlowe's are the mightiest, so are Peele's the\r\nsoftest, lines in the drama before Shakespere; while the spirit and humour,\r\nwhich the author also had in plenty, save his work from the merely cloying\r\nsweetness of some contemporary writers. Two of his interposed or occasional\r\nlyrics will be given later: a blank verse passage may find room here:--\r\n\r\n    _Bethsabe._ \"Come, gentle Zephyr, trick'd with those perfumes\r\n                That erst in Eden sweeten'd Adam's love,\r\n                And stroke my bosom with thy silken fan:\r\n                This shade, sun-proof,[21] is yet no proof for thee;\r\n                Thy body, smoother than this waveless spring,\r\n                And purer than the substance of the same,\r\n                Can creep through that his lances cannot pierce:\r\n                Thou, and thy sister, soft and sacred Air,\r\n                Goddess of life, and governess of health,\r\n                Keep every fountain fresh and arbour sweet;\r\n                No brazen gate her passage can repulse,\r\n                Nor bushy thicket bar thy subtle breath:\r\n                Then deck thee with thy loose delightsome robes,\r\n                And on thy wings bring delicate perfumes,\r\n                To play the wanton with us through the leaves.\"\r\n\r\n[21] Cf. Milton's \"elms star-proof\" in the _Arcades_. Milton evidently knew\r\nPeele well.\r\n\r\nRobert Greene, probably, if not certainly, the next in age of the group to\r\nPeele, was born in 1560, the son of apparently well-to-do parents at\r\nNorwich, and was educated at Clare Hall, Cambridge, where he took his\r\nMaster's degree in 1553. He was subsequently incorporated at Oxford, and\r\nbeing by no means ill-inclined to make the most of himself, sometimes took\r\nthe style of a member \"Utriusque Academiae.\" After leaving the university\r\nhe seems to have made a long tour on the Continent, not (according to his\r\nown account) at all to the advantage of his morals or means. He is said to\r\nhave actually taken orders, and held a living for some short time, while he\r\nperhaps also studied if he did not practise medicine. He married a lady of\r\nvirtue and some fortune, but soon despoiled and deserted her, and for the\r\nlast six years of his life never saw her. At last in 1592, aged only two\r\nand thirty,--but after about ten years it would seem of reckless living and\r\nhasty literary production,--he died (of a disease caused or aggravated by a\r\ndebauch on pickled herrings and Rhenish) so miserably poor that he had to\r\ntrust to his injured wife's forgiveness for payment of the money to the\r\nextent of which a charitable landlord and landlady had trusted him. The\r\nfacts of this lamentable end may have been spitefully distorted by Gabriel\r\nHarvey in his quarrel with Nash; but there is little reason to doubt that\r\nthe received story is in the main correct. Of the remarkable prose\r\npamphlets which form the bulk of Greene's work we speak elsewhere, as also\r\nof the pretty songs (considerably exceeding in poetical merit anything to\r\nbe found in the body of his plays) with which both pamphlets and plays are\r\ndiversified. His actual dramatic production is not inconsiderable: a\r\nworking-up of the _Orlando Furioso_; _A Looking Glass for London and\r\nEngland_ (Nineveh) with Lodge; _James IV._ (of Scotland), a wildly\r\nunhistorical romance; _Alphonsus, King of Arragon_; and perhaps _The Pinner\r\nof Wakefield_, which deals with his own part namesake George-a-Greene; not\r\nimpossibly also the pseudo-Shakesperian _Fair Em_. His best play without\r\ndoubt is _The History of Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay_, in which, after a\r\nfavourite fashion of the time, he mingles a certain amount of history, or,\r\nat least, a certain number of historical personages, with a plentiful dose\r\nof the supernatural and of horseplay, and with a very graceful and\r\nprettily-handled love story. With a few touches from the master's hand,\r\nMargaret, the fair maid of Fressingfield, might serve as handmaid to\r\nShakespere's women, and is certainly by far the most human heroine\r\nproduced by any of Greene's own group. There is less rant in Greene (though\r\nthere is still plenty of it) than in any of his friends, and his fancy for\r\nsoft female characters, loving, and yet virtuous, appears frequently. But\r\nhis power is ill-sustained, as the following extract will show:--\r\n\r\n    _Margaret._ \"Ah, father, when the harmony of heaven\r\n                Soundeth the measures of a lively faith,\r\n                The vain illusions of this flattering world\r\n                Seem odious to the thoughts of Margaret.\r\n                I loved once,--Lord Lacy was my love;\r\n                And now I hate myself for that I loved,\r\n                And doted more on him than on my God,--\r\n                For this I scourge myself with sharp repents.\r\n                But now the touch of such aspiring sins\r\n                Tells me all love is lust but love of heaven;\r\n                That beauty used for love is vanity:\r\n                The world contains naught but alluring baits,\r\n                Pride, flattery [    ], and inconstant thoughts.\r\n                To shun the pricks of death I leave the world,\r\n                And vow to meditate on heavenly bliss,\r\n                To live in Framlingham a holy nun,\r\n                Holy and pure in conscience and in deed;\r\n                And for to wish all maids to learn of me\r\n                To seek heaven's joy before earth's vanity.\"\r\n\r\nWe do not know anything of Thomas Kyd's, except _The Spanish Tragedy_,\r\nwhich is a second part of an extremely popular play (sometimes attributed\r\nto Kyd himself, but probably earlier) called _Jeronimo_, and the\r\ntranslation of _Cornelia_, though others are doubtfully attributed. The\r\nwell-known epithet of Jonson, \"sporting\" Kyd, seems to have been either a\r\nmere play on the poet's name, or else _a lucus a non lucendo_; for both\r\n_Jeronimo_ and its sequel are in the ghastliest and bloodiest vein of\r\ntragedy, and _Cornelia_ is a model of stately dullness. The two \"Jeronimo\"\r\nor \"Hieronimo\" plays were, as has been said, extremely popular, and it is\r\npositively known that Jonson himself, and probably others, were employed\r\nfrom time to time to freshen them up; with the consequence that the exact\r\nauthorship of particular passages is somewhat problematical. Both plays,\r\nhowever, display, nearly in perfection, the rant, not always quite\r\nridiculous, but always extravagant, from which Shakespere rescued the\r\nstage; though, as the following extract will show, this rant is by no means\r\nalways, or indeed often, smoke without fire:--\r\n\r\n                              \"O! forbear,\r\n    For other talk for us far fitter were.\r\n    But if you be importunate to know\r\n    The way to him, and where to find him out,\r\n    Then list to me, and I'll resolve your doubt.\r\n    There is a path upon your left hand side,\r\n    That leadeth from a guilty conscience\r\n    Unto a forest of distrust and fear--\r\n    A darksome place and dangerous to pass.\r\n    There shall you meet with melancholy thoughts\r\n    Whose baleful humours if you but uphold,\r\n    It will conduct you to despair and death.\r\n    Whose rocky cliffs when you have once beheld\r\n    Within a hugy dale of lasting night--\r\n    That, kindled with the world's iniquities,\r\n    Doth cast up filthy and detested fumes--\r\n    Not far from thence, where murderers have built\r\n    An habitation for their cursed souls,\r\n    There is a brazen cauldron fixed by Jove\r\n    In his fell wrath upon a sulphur flame.\r\n    Yourselves shall find Lorenzo bathing him\r\n    In boiling lead and blood of innocents.\"\r\n\r\nBut nothing, except citation of whole scenes and acts, could show the\r\nextraordinary jumble of ghosts, blood, thunder, treachery, and horrors of\r\nall sorts which these plays contain.\r\n\r\nNow for a very different citation:--\r\n\r\n    \"If all the pens that ever poets held\r\n    Had fed the feeling of their masters' thoughts,\r\n    And every sweetness that inspir'd their hearts,\r\n    Their minds, and muses, on admired themes;\r\n    If all the heavenly quintessence they 'still\r\n    From their immortal flowers of poesy,\r\n    Wherein as in a mirror we perceive\r\n    The highest reaches of a human wit;\r\n    If these had made one poem's period,\r\n    And all combined in beauty's worthiness,\r\n    Yet should there hover in their restless heads\r\n    One thought, one grace, one wonder at the least\r\n    Which into words no virtue can digest.\"\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that the whole school has been dwarfed in the general\r\nestimation, since its work was critically considered and isolated from\r\nother work, by the towering excellence of this author. Little as is known\r\nof all the band, that little becomes almost least in regard to their chief\r\nand leader. Born (1564) at Canterbury, the son of a shoemaker, he was\r\neducated at the Grammar School of that city, and at Benet (afterwards\r\nCorpus) College, Cambridge; he plunged into literary work and dissipation\r\nin London; and he outlived Greene only to fall a victim to debauchery in a\r\nstill more tragical way. His death (1593) was the subject of much gossip,\r\nbut the most probable account is that he was poniarded in self-defence by a\r\ncertain Francis Archer, a serving-man (not by any means necessarily, as\r\nCharles Kingsley has it, a footman), while drinking at Deptford, and that\r\nthe cause of the quarrel was a woman of light character. He has also been\r\naccused of gross vices not to be particularised, and of atheism. The\r\naccusation is certain; and Mr. Boas's researches as to Kyd, who was also\r\nconcerned in the matter, have thrown some light on it; but much is still\r\nobscure. The most offensive charges were due to one Bame or Baines, who was\r\nafterwards hanged at Tyburn. That Marlowe was a Bohemian in the fullest\r\nsense is certain; that he was anything worse there is no evidence whatever.\r\nHe certainly was acquainted with Raleigh and other distinguished persons,\r\nand was highly spoken of by Chapman and others.\r\n\r\nBut the interest of Marlowe's name has nothing to do with these obscure\r\nscandals of three hundred years ago, though it may be difficult to pass\r\nthem over entirely. He is the undoubted author of some of the masterpieces\r\nof English verse; the hardly to be doubted author of others not much\r\ninferior. Except the very greatest names--Shakespere, Milton, Spenser,\r\nDryden, Shelley--no author can be named who has produced, when the proper\r\nhistorical estimate is applied to him, such work as is to be found in\r\n_Tamburlaine_, _Doctor Faustus_, _The Jew of Malta_, _Edward the Second_,\r\nin one department; _Hero and Leander_ and the _Passionate Shepherd_ in\r\nanother. I have but very little doubt that the powerful, if formless, play\r\nof _Lust's Dominion_ is Marlowe's, though it may have been rewritten, and\r\nthe translations of Lucan and Ovid and the minor work which is more or less\r\nprobably attributed to him, swell his tale. Prose he did not write, perhaps\r\ncould not have written. For the one characteristic lacking to his genius\r\nwas measure, and prose without measure, as numerous examples have shown, is\r\nusually rubbish. Even his dramas show a singular defect in the\r\narchitectural quality of literary genius. The vast and formless creations\r\nof the writer's boundless fancy completely master him; his aspirations\r\nafter the immense too frequently leave him content with the simply\r\nunmeasured. In his best play as a play, _Edward the Second_, the\r\nlimitations of a historical story impose something like a restraining form\r\non his glowing imagination. But fine as this play is, it is noteworthy that\r\nno one of his greatest things occurs in it. _The Massacre at Paris_, where\r\nhe also has the confinement of reality after a fashion, is a chaotic thing\r\nas a whole, without any great beauty in parts. _The Tragedy of Dido_ (to be\r\ndivided between him and Nash) is the worst thing he ever did. But in the\r\npurely romantic subjects of _Tamburlaine_, _Faustus_, and _The Jew of\r\nMalta_, his genius, untrammelled by any limits of story, showed itself\r\nequally unable to contrive such limits for itself, and able to develop the\r\nmost marvellous beauties of detail. Shakespere himself has not surpassed,\r\nwhich is equivalent to saying that no other writer has equalled, the famous\r\nand wonderful passages in _Tamburlaine_ and _Faustus_, which are familiar\r\nto every student of English literature as examples of the _ne plus ultra_\r\nof the poetic powers, not of the language but of language. The tragic\r\nimagination in its wildest flights has never summoned up images of pity\r\nand terror more imposing, more moving, than those excited by _The Jew of\r\nMalta_. The riot of passion and of delight in the beauty of colour and form\r\nwhich characterises his version of _Hero and Leander_ has never been\r\napproached by any writer. But Marlowe, with the fullest command of the\r\n_apeiron_, had not, and, as far as I can judge, never would have had, any\r\npower of introducing into it the law of the _peras_. It is usual to say\r\nthat had he lived, and had his lot been happily cast, we should have had\r\ntwo Shakesperes. This is not wise. In the first place, Marlowe was totally\r\ndestitute of humour--the characteristic which, united with his tragic and\r\nimaginative powers, makes Shakespere as, in a less degree, it makes Homer,\r\nand even, though the humour is grim and intermittent, Dante. In other\r\nwords, he was absolutely destitute of the first requisite of\r\nself-criticism. In the natural course of things, as the sap of his youthful\r\nimagination ceased to mount, and as his craving for immensity hardened\r\nitself, he would probably have degenerated from bombast shot through with\r\ngenius to bombast pure and simple, from _Faustus_ to _Lust's Dominion_, and\r\nfrom _Lust's Dominion_ to _Jeronimo_ or _The Distracted Emperor_. Apart\r\nfrom the magnificent passages which he can show, and which are simply\r\nintoxicating to any lover of poetry, his great title to fame is the\r\ndiscovery of the secret of that \"mighty line\" which a seldom-erring critic\r\nof his own day, not too generously given, vouchsafed to him. Up to his time\r\nthe blank verse line always, and the semi-couplet in heroics, or member of\r\nthe more complicated stanza usually, were either stiff or nerveless.\r\nCompared with his own work and with the work of his contemporaries and\r\nfollowers who learnt from him, they are like a dried preparation, like\r\nsomething waiting for the infusion of blood, for the inflation of living\r\nbreath. Marlowe came, and the old wooden versification, the old lay-figure\r\nstructure of poetic rhythm, was cast once for all into the lumber-room,\r\nwhere only poetasters of the lowest rank went to seek it. It is impossible\r\nto call Marlowe a great dramatist, and the attempts that have been made to\r\nmake him out to be such remind one of the attempts that have been made to\r\ncall Moliere a great poet. Marlowe was one of the greatest poets of the\r\nworld whose work was cast by accident and caprice into an imperfect mould\r\nof drama; Moliere was one of the greatest dramatists of the world who was\r\nobliged by fashion to use a previously perfected form of verse. The state\r\nof Moliere was undoubtedly the more gracious; but the splendour of\r\nMarlowe's uncut diamonds of poetry is the more wonderful.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of this strange and interesting school may be summed up\r\nbriefly, but are of the highest importance in literary history. Unlike\r\ntheir nearest analogues, the French romantics of the 1830 type, they were\r\nall of academic education, and had even a decided contempt (despite their\r\nBohemian way of life) for unscholarly innovators. They manifested (except\r\nin Marlowe's fortuitous and purely genial discovery of the secret of blank\r\nverse) a certain contempt for form, and never, at least in drama, succeeded\r\nin mastering it. But being all, more or less, men of genius, and having the\r\nkeenest sense of poetry, they supplied the dry bones of the precedent\r\ndramatic model with blood and breath, with vigour and variety, which not\r\nmerely informed but transformed it. _David and Bethsabe_, _Doctor Faustus_,\r\n_Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay_, are chaotic enough, but they are of the\r\nchaos that precedes cosmic development. The almost insane bombast that\r\nmarks the whole school has (as has been noticed) the character of the\r\nshrieks and gesticulations of healthy childhood, and the insensibility to\r\nthe really comic which also marks them is of a similar kind. Every one\r\nknows how natural it is to childhood to appreciate bad jokes, how seldom a\r\nchild sees a good one. Marlowe and his crew, too (the comparison has no\r\ndoubt often been used before), were of the brood of Otus and Ephialtes, who\r\ngrew so rapidly and in so disorderly a fashion that it was necessary for\r\nthe gods to make an end of them. The universe probably lost little, and it\r\ncertainly gained something.\r\n\r\nSide by side with this learned, extravagant, gifted, ill-regulated school,\r\nthere was slowly growing up a very different one, which was to inherit all\r\nthe gifts of the University Wits, and to add to them the gifts of measure\r\nand proportion. The early work of the actor school of English dramatists is\r\na difficult subject to treat in any fashion, and a particularly difficult\r\nsubject to treat shortly. Chronology, an important aid, helps us not very\r\nmuch, though such help as she does give has been as a rule neglected by\r\nhistorians, so that plays before 1590 (which may be taken roughly as the\r\ndividing date), and plays after it have been muddled up ruthlessly. We do\r\nnot know the exact dates of many of those which are (many of the plays of\r\nthe earlier time are not) extant; and of those which are extant, and of\r\nwhich the dates are more or less known, the authors are in not a few most\r\nimportant cases absolutely undiscoverable. Yet in the plays which belong to\r\nthis period, and which there is no reason to attribute wholly to any of the\r\nMarlowe group, or much reason to attribute to them under the guidance, or\r\nperhaps with the collaboration of practical actors (some at least of whom\r\nwere like Shakespere himself, men of no known regular education), there are\r\ncharacteristics which promise at least as well for the future as the\r\nwonderful poetic outbursts of the Marlowe school itself. Of these outbursts\r\nwe find few in this other division. But we find a growing knowledge of what\r\na play is, as distinguished from a series of tableaux acted by not too\r\nlifelike characters. We find a glimmering (which is hardly anywhere to be\r\nseen in the more literary work of the other school) of the truth that the\r\ncharacters must be made to work out the play, and not the play be written\r\nin a series of disjointed scenes to display, in anything but a successful\r\nfashion, the characters. With fewer flights we have fewer absurdities; with\r\nless genius we have more talent. It must be remembered, of course, that the\r\nplays of the university school itself were always written for players, and\r\nthat some of the authors had more or less to do with acting as well as with\r\nwriting. But the flame of discord which burns so fiercely on the one side\r\nin the famous real or supposed dying utterances of Greene, and which years\r\nafterwards breaks out on the other in the equally famous satire of _The\r\nReturn from Parnassus_,[22] illuminates a real difference--a difference\r\nwhich study of the remains of the literature of the period can only make\r\nplainer. The same difference has manifested itself again, and more than\r\nonce in other departments of literature, but hardly in so interesting a\r\nmanner, and certainly not with such striking results.\r\n\r\n[22] The outburst of Greene about \"the only Shakescene,\" the \"upstart crow\r\nbeautified with our feathers,\" and so forth, is too well known to need\r\nextracting here. _The Return from Parnassus_, a very curious tripartite\r\nplay, performed 1597-1601 but retrospective in tone, is devoted to the\r\ntroubles of poor scholars in getting a livelihood, and incidentally gives\r\nmuch matter on the authors of the time from Shakespere downward, and on the\r\njealousy of professional actors felt by scholars, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\"THE FAERIE QUEENE\" AND ITS GROUP\r\n\r\n    \"Velut inter ignes luna minores\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no instance in English history of a poet receiving such immediate\r\nrecognition, and deserving it so thoroughly, as did Edmund Spenser at the\r\ndate of _The Shepherd's Calendar_. In the first chapter of this volume the\r\nearlier course of Elizabethan poetry has been described, and it will have\r\nbeen seen that, with great intention, no very great accomplishment had been\r\nachieved. It was sufficiently evident that a poetic language and a general\r\npoetic spirit were being formed, such as had not existed in England since\r\nChaucer's death; but no one had yet arisen who could justify the\r\nexpectation based on such respectable tentatives. It seems from many minute\r\nindications which need not be detailed here, that at the advent of _The\r\nShepherd's Calendar_ all the best judges recognised the expected poet. Yet\r\nthey could hardly have known how just their recognition was, or what\r\nextraordinary advances the poet would make in the twenty years which passed\r\nbetween its publication and his death.\r\n\r\nThe life of Spenser is very little known, and here and elsewhere the\r\nconditions of this book preclude the reproduction or even the discussion of\r\nthe various pious attempts which have been made to supply the deficiency of\r\ndocuments. The chief of these in his case is to be found in Dr. Grosart's\r\nmagnificent edition, the principal among many good works of its editor.\r\nThat he belonged to a branch--a Lancashire branch in all probability--of\r\nthe family which produced the Le Despensers of elder, and the Spencers of\r\nmodern English history, may be said to be unquestionable. But he appears to\r\nhave been born about 1552 in London, and to have been educated at Merchant\r\nTaylors', whence in May 1569 he matriculated at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge,\r\nas a sizar. At or before this time he must have contributed (though there\r\nare puzzles in the matter) certain translations of sonnets from Petrarch\r\nand Du Bellay to a book called _The Theatre of Voluptuous Worldlings_,\r\npublished by a Brabanter, John van der Noodt. These, slightly changed from\r\nblank verse to rhyme, appeared long afterwards with his minor poems of\r\n1590. But the original pieces had been claimed by the Dutchman; and though\r\nthere are easy ways of explaining this, the thing is curious. However it\r\nmay be with these verses, certainly nothing else of Spenser's appeared in\r\nprint for ten years. His Cambridge life, except for some vague allusions\r\n(which, as usual in such cases, have been strained to breaking by\r\ncommentators and biographers), is equally obscure; save that he certainly\r\nfulfilled seven years of residence, taking his Bachelor's Degree in 1573,\r\nand his Master's three years later. But he did not gain a fellowship, and\r\nthe chief discoverable results of his Cambridge sojourn were the thorough\r\nscholarship which marks his work, and his friendship with the notorious\r\nGabriel Harvey--his senior by some years, a Fellow of Pembroke, and a\r\nperson whose singularly bad literary taste, as shown in his correspondence\r\nwith Spenser, may be perhaps forgiven, first, because it did no harm, and\r\nsecondly, because without him we should know even less of Spenser than we\r\ndo. It is reasonably supposed from the notes of his friend, \"E. K.\"\r\n(apparently Kirke, a Pembroke man), to _The Shepherd's Calendar_, that he\r\nwent to his friends in the north after leaving Cambridge and spent a year\r\nor two there, falling in love with the heroine, poetically named Rosalind,\r\nof _The Calendar_, and no doubt writing that remarkable book. Then\r\n(probably very late in 1578) he went to London, was introduced by Harvey\r\nto Sidney and Leicester, and thus mixed at once in the best literary and\r\npolitical society. He was not long in putting forth his titles to its\r\nattention, for _The Shepherd's Calendar_ was published in the winter of\r\n1579, copiously edited by \"E. K.,\" whom some absurdly suppose to be Spenser\r\nhimself. The poet seems to have had also numerous works (the titles of\r\nwhich are known) ready or nearly ready for the press. But all were\r\nsubsequently either changed in title, incorporated with other work, or\r\nlost. He had already begun _The Faerie Queene_, much to the pedant Harvey's\r\ndisgust; and he dabbled in the fashionable absurdity of classical metres,\r\nlike his inferiors. But he published nothing more immediately; and powerful\r\nas were his patrons, the only preferment which he obtained was in that\r\nEldorado-Purgatory of Elizabethan ambition--Ireland. Lord Grey took him as\r\nprivate secretary when he was in 1580 appointed deputy, and shortly\r\nafterwards he received some civil posts in his new country, and a lease of\r\nabbey lands at Enniscorthy, which lease he soon gave up. But he stayed in\r\nIreland, notwithstanding the fact that his immediate patron Grey soon left\r\nit. Except a few bare dates and doubtful allusions, little or nothing is\r\nheard of him between 1580 and 1590. On the eve of the latter year (the 1st\r\nof December 1589) the first three books of _The Faerie Queene_ were entered\r\nat Stationers' Hall, and were published in the spring of the next year. He\r\nhad been already established at Kilcolman in the county Cork on a grant of\r\nmore than three thousand acres of land out of the forfeited Desmond\r\nestates. And henceforward his literary activity, at least in publication,\r\nbecame more considerable, and he seems to have been much backwards and\r\nforwards between England and Ireland. In 1590 appeared a volume of minor\r\npoems (_The Ruins of Time_, _The Tears of the Muses_, _Virgil's Gnat_,\r\n_Mother Hubbard's Tale_, _The Ruins of Rome_, _Muiopotmos_, and the\r\n_Visions_), with an address to the reader in which another list of\r\nforthcoming works is promised. These, like the former list of Kirke, seem\r\noddly enough to have also perished. The whole collection was called\r\n_Complaints_, and a somewhat similar poem, _Daphnaida_, is thought to have\r\nappeared in the same year. On the 11th of June 1594 the poet married\r\n(strangely enough it was not known whom, until Dr. Grosart ingeniously\r\nidentified her with a certain Elizabeth Boyle _alias_ Seckerstone), and in\r\n1595 were published the beautiful _Amoretti_ or love sonnets, and the still\r\nmore beautiful _Epithalamion_ describing his courtship and marriage, with\r\nthe interesting poem of _Colin Clout's Come Home Again_; while in the same\r\nyear (old style; in January 1596, new style) the fourth, fifth, and sixth\r\nbooks of _The Faerie Queene_ were entered for publication and soon\r\nappeared. The supposed allusions to Mary Stuart greatly offended her son\r\nJames. The _Hymns_ and the _Prothalamion_ followed in the same year.\r\nSpenser met with difficulties at Court (though he had obtained a small\r\npension of fifty pounds a year), and had like other Englishmen troubles\r\nwith his neighbours in Ireland; yet he seemed to be becoming more\r\nprosperous, and in 1598 he was named Sheriff of Cork. A few weeks later the\r\nIrish Rebellion broke out; his house was sacked and burnt with one of his\r\nchildren; he fled to England and died on the 16th of January 1599 at King\r\nStreet, Westminster, perhaps not \"for lack of bread,\" as Jonson says, but\r\ncertainly in no fortunate circumstances. In the year of his misfortune had\r\nbeen registered, though it was never printed till more than thirty years\r\nlater, his one prose work of substance, the remarkable _View of the Present\r\nState of Ireland_; an admirable piece of prose, and a political tract, the\r\nwisdom and grasp of which only those who have had to give close attention\r\nto Irish politics can fully estimate. It is probably the most valuable\r\ndocument on any given period of Irish history that exists, and is certainly\r\nsuperior in matter, no less than in style, to any political tract in\r\nEnglish, published before the days of Halifax eighty years after.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that _The Shepherd's Calendar_ placed Spenser at once at\r\nthe head of the English poets of his day; and it did so. But had he written\r\nnothing more, he would not (as is the case with not a few distinguished\r\npoets) have occupied as high or nearly as high a position in quality, if\r\nnot in quantity, as he now does. He was a young man when he published it;\r\nhe was not indeed an old man when he died; and it would not appear that he\r\nhad had much experience of life beyond college walls. His choice of\r\nmodels--the artificial pastorals in which the Renaissance had modelled\r\nitself on Virgil and Theocritus, rather than Virgil and Theocritus\r\nthemselves--was not altogether happy. He showed, indeed, already his\r\nextraordinary metrical skill, experimenting with rhyme-royal and other\r\nstanzas, fourteeners or eights and sixes, anapaests more or less irregular,\r\nand an exceedingly important variety of octosyllable which, whatever may\r\nhave been his own idea in practising it, looked back to early Middle\r\nEnglish rhythms and forward to the metre of _Christabel_, as Coleridge was\r\nto start it afresh. He also transgressed into religious politics, taking\r\n(as indeed he always took, strange as it may seem in so fanatical a\r\nworshipper of beauty) the Puritan side. Nor is his work improved as poetry,\r\nthough it acquires something in point of quaint attractiveness, by good Mr.\r\n\"E. K.'s\" elaborate annotations, introductions, explanations, and general\r\ngentleman-usherings--the first in English, but most wofully not the last by\r\nhundreds, of such overlayings of gold with copper. Yet with all these\r\ndrawbacks _The Shepherd's Calendar_ is delightful. Already we can see in it\r\nthat double command, at once of the pictorial and the musical elements of\r\npoetry, in which no English poet is Spenser's superior, if any is his\r\nequal. Already the unmatched power of vigorous allegory, which he was to\r\ndisplay later, shows in such pieces as _The Oak and the Briar_. In the less\r\ndeliberately archaic divisions, such as \"April\" and \"November,\" the command\r\nof metrical form, in which also the poet is almost peerless, discovers\r\nitself. Much the same may be said of the volume of _Complaints_, which,\r\nthough published later than _The Faerie Queene_, represents beyond all\r\nquestion very much earlier work. Spenser is unquestionably, when he is not\r\nat once spurred and soothed by the play of his own imagination, as in _The\r\nQueene_, a melancholy poet, and the note of melancholy is as strong in\r\nthese poems as in their joint title. It combines with his delight in\r\nemblematic allegory happily enough, in most of these pieces except _Mother\r\nHubbard's Tale_. This is almost an open satire, and shows that if Spenser's\r\ngenius had not found a less mongrel style to disport itself in, not merely\r\nwould Donne, and Lodge, and Hall, and Marston have had to abandon their\r\ndispute for the post of first English satirist, but the attainment of\r\nreally great satire in English might have been hastened by a hundred years,\r\nand _Absalom and Achitophel_ have been but a second. Even here, however,\r\nthe piece still keeps the Chaucerian form and manner, and is only a kind of\r\nexercise. The sonnets from and after Du Bellay and others are more\r\ninteresting. As in the subsequent and far finer _Amoretti_, Spenser prefers\r\nthe final couplet form to the so-called Petrarchian arrangement; and,\r\nindeed, though the most recent fashion in England has inclined to the\r\nlatter, an impartial judgment must pronounce both forms equally good and\r\nequally entitled to place. The _Amoretti_ written in this metre, and\r\nundoubtedly representing some, at least, of Spenser's latest written work,\r\nrank with the best of Sidney's, and hardly below the best of Shakespere's;\r\nwhile both in them and in the earlier sonnets the note of regret mingled\r\nwith delight--the special Renaissance note--sounds as it rarely does in any\r\nother English verse. Of the poems of the later period, however (leaving\r\n_The Faerie Queene_ for a moment aside), the _Epithalamion_ and the _Four\r\nHymns_ rank undoubtedly highest. For splendour of imagery, for harmony of\r\nverse, for delicate taste and real passion, the _Epithalamion_ excels all\r\nother poems of its class, and the _Four Hymns_ express a rapture of\r\nPlatonic enthusiasm, which may indeed be answerable for the unreadable\r\n_Psyches_ and _Psychozoias_ of the next age, but which is itself married to\r\nimmortal verse in the happiest manner.\r\n\r\nStill, to the ordinary reader, Spenser is the poet of _The Faerie Queene_,\r\nand for once the ordinary reader is right. Every quality found in his other\r\npoems is found in this greatest of them in perfection; and much is found\r\nthere which is not, and indeed could not be, found anywhere else. Its\r\ngeneral scheme is so well known (few as may be the readers who really know\r\nits details) that very slight notice of it may suffice. Twelve knights,\r\nrepresenting twelve virtues, were to have been sent on adventures from the\r\nCourt of Gloriana, Queen of Fairyland. The six finished books give the\r\nlegends (each subdivided into twelve cantos, averaging fifty or sixty\r\nstanzas each) of Holiness, Temperance, Chastity, Friendship, Justice, and\r\nCourtesy; while a fragment of two splendid \"Cantos on Mutability\" is\r\nsupposed to have belonged to a seventh book (not necessarily seventh in\r\norder) on Constancy. Legend has it that the poem was actually completed;\r\nbut this seems improbable, as the first three books were certainly ten\r\nyears in hand, and the second three six more. The existing poem\r\ncomprehending some four thousand stanzas, or between thirty and forty\r\nthousand lines, exhibits so many and such varied excellences that it is\r\ndifficult to believe that the poet could have done anything new in kind. No\r\npart of it is as a whole inferior to any other part, and the fragmentary\r\ncantos contain not merely one of the most finished pictorial pieces--the\r\nProcession of the Months--to be found in the whole poem, but much of the\r\npoet's finest thought and verse. Had fortune been kinder, the volume of\r\ndelight would have been greater, but its general character would probably\r\nnot have changed much. As it is, _The Faerie Queene_ is the only long poem\r\nthat a lover of poetry can sincerely wish longer.\r\n\r\nIt deserves some critical examination here from three points of view,\r\nregarding respectively its general scheme, its minor details of form in\r\nmetre and language, and lastly, its general poetical characteristics. The\r\nfirst is simple enough in its complexity. The poem is a long _Roman\r\nd'Aventure_ (which it is perhaps as well to say, once for all, is not the\r\nsame as a \"Romance of Chivalry,\" or a \"Romance of Adventure\"), redeemed\r\nfrom the aimless prolixity incident to that form by its regular plan, by\r\nthe intercommunion of the adventures of the several knights (none of whom\r\ndisappears after having achieved his own quest), and by the constant\r\npresence of a not too obtrusive allegory. This last characteristic attaches\r\nit on the other side to the poems of the _Roman de la Rose_ order, which\r\nsucceeded the _Romans d'Aventures_ as objects of literary interest and\r\npractice, not merely in France, but throughout Europe. This allegory has\r\nbeen variously estimated as a merit or defect of the poem. It is sometimes\r\npolitical, oftener religious, very often moral, and sometimes purely\r\npersonal--the identifications in this latter case being sometimes clear, as\r\nthat of Gloriana, Britomart, and Belphoebe with Queen Elizabeth, sometimes\r\nprobable, as that of Duessa with Queen Mary (not one of Spenser's most\r\nknightly actions), and of Prince Arthur with Leicester, and sometimes more\r\nor less problematical, as that of Artegall with Lord Grey, of Timias the\r\nSquire with Raleigh, and so forth. To those who are perplexed by these\r\ndouble meanings the best remark is Hazlitt's blunt one that \"the allegory\r\nwon't bite them.\" In other words, it is always perfectly possible to enjoy\r\nthe poem without troubling oneself about the allegory at all, except in its\r\nbroad ethical features, which are quite unmistakable. On the other hand, I\r\nam inclined to think that the presence of these under-meanings, with the\r\ninterest which they give to a moderately instructed and intelligent person\r\nwho, without too desperate a determination to see into millstones,\r\nunderstands \"words to the wise,\" is a great addition to the hold of the\r\npoem over the attention, and saves it from the charge of mere\r\ndesultoriness, which some, at least, of the other greatest poems of the\r\nkind (notably its immediate exemplar, the _Orlando Furioso_) must undergo.\r\nAnd here it may be noted that the charge made by most foreign critics who\r\nhave busied themselves with Spenser, and perhaps by some of his countrymen,\r\nthat he is, if not a mere paraphrast, yet little more than a transplanter\r\ninto English of the Italian, is glaringly uncritical. Not, perhaps, till\r\nAriosto and Tasso have been carefully read in the original, is Spenser's\r\nreal greatness understood. He has often, and evidently of purpose,\r\nchallenged comparison; but in every instance it will be found that his\r\nbeauties are emphatically his own. He has followed his leaders only as\r\nVirgil has followed Homer; and much less slavishly.\r\n\r\nIt is strange to find English critics of this great if not greatest English\r\npoem even nowadays repeating that Spenser borrowed his wonderful stanza\r\nfrom the Italians. He did nothing of the kind. That the _ottava rima_ on\r\nthe one hand, and the sonnet on the other, may have suggested the idea of\r\nit is quite possible. But the Spenserian stanza, as it is justly called, is\r\nhis own and no one else's, and its merits, especially that primal merit of\r\nadaptation to the subject and style of the poem, are unique. Nothing else\r\ncould adapt itself so perfectly to the endless series of vignettes and\r\ndissolving views which the poet delights in giving; while, at the same\r\ntime, it has, for so elaborate and apparently integral a form, a singular\r\nfaculty of hooking itself on to stanzas preceding and following, so as not\r\nto interrupt continuous narrative when continuous narrative is needed. Its\r\ngreat compass, admitting of an almost infinite variety of cadence and\r\ncomposition, saves it from the monotony from which even the consummate art\r\nof Milton could not save blank verse now and then, and from which no writer\r\nhas ever been able to save the couplet, or the quatrain, or the stanzas\r\nending with a couplet, in narratives of very great length. But the most\r\nremarkable instance of harmony between metrical form and other\r\ncharacteristics, both of form and matter, in the metrist has yet to be\r\nmentioned. It has been said how well the stanza suits Spenser's pictorial\r\nfaculty; it certainly suits his musical faculty as well. The slightly (very\r\nslightly, for he can be vigorous enough) languid turn of his grace, the\r\nvoluptuous cadences of his rhythm, find in it the most perfect exponent\r\npossible. The verse of great poets, especially Homer's, has often been\r\ncompared to the sea. Spenser's is more like a river, wide, and deep, and\r\nstrong, but moderating its waves and conveying them all in a steady, soft,\r\nirresistible sweep forwards. To aid him, besides this extraordinary\r\ninstrument of metre, he had forged for himself another in his language. A\r\ngreat deal has been written on this--comments, at least of the\r\nunfavourable kind, generally echoing Ben Jonson's complaint that Spenser\r\n\"writ no language\"; that his dialect is not the dialect of any actual place\r\nor time, that it is an artificial \"poetic diction\" made up of Chaucer, and\r\nof Northern dialect, and of classicisms, and of foreign words, and of\r\nmiscellaneous archaisms from no matter where. No doubt it is. But if any\r\nother excuse than the fact of a beautiful and satisfactory effect is wanted\r\nfor the formation of a poetic diction different from the actually spoken or\r\nthe ordinarily written tongue of the day (and I am not sure that any such\r\nexcuse is required) it is to be found at once. There was no actually spoken\r\nor ordinarily written tongue in Spenser's day which could claim to be\r\n\"Queen's English.\" Chaucer was obsolete, and since Chaucer there was no\r\nsingle person who could even pretend to authority. Every writer more or\r\nless endowed with originality was engaged in beating out for himself, from\r\npopular talk, and from classical or foreign analogy, an instrument of\r\nspeech. Spenser's verse language and Lyly's prose are the most remarkable\r\nresults of the process; but it was, in fact, not only a common but a\r\nnecessary one, and in no way to be blamed. As for the other criterion\r\nhinted at above, no one is likely to condemn the diction according to that.\r\nIn its remoteness without grotesqueness, in its lavish colour, in its\r\nabundance of matter for every kind of cadence and sound-effect, it is\r\nexactly suited to the subject, the writer, and the verse.\r\n\r\nIt is this singular and complete adjustment of worker and implement which,\r\nwith other peculiarities noted or to be noted, gives _The Faerie Queene_\r\nits unique unicity, if such a conceit may be pardoned. From some points of\r\nview it might be called a very artificial poem, yet no poem runs with such\r\nan entire absence of effort, with such an easy eloquence, with such an\r\neffect, as has been said already, of flowing water. With all his learning,\r\nand his archaisms, and his classicisms, and his Platonisms, and his isms\r\nwithout end, hardly any poet smells of the lamp less disagreeably than\r\nSpenser. Where Milton forges and smelts, his gold is native. The endless,\r\nvarious, brightly-coloured, softly and yet distinctly outlined pictures\r\nrise and pass before the eyes and vanish--the multiform, sweetly-linked,\r\nsoftly-sounding harmonies swell and die and swell again on the ear--without\r\na break, without a jar, softer than sleep and as continuous, gayer than the\r\nrainbow and as undiscoverably connected with any obvious cause. And this is\r\nthe more remarkable because the very last thing that can be said of Spenser\r\nis that he is a poet of mere words. Milton himself, the severe Milton,\r\nextolled his moral teaching; his philosophical idealism is evidently no\r\nmere poet's plaything or parrot-lesson, but thoroughly thought out and\r\nbelieved in. He is a determined, almost a savage partisan in politics and\r\nreligion, a steady patriot, something of a statesman, very much indeed of a\r\nfriend and a lover. And of all this there is ample evidence in his verse.\r\nYet the alchemy of his poetry has passed through the potent alembics of\r\nverse and phrase all these rebellious things, and has distilled them into\r\nthe inimitably fluent and velvet medium which seems to lull some readers to\r\ninattention by its very smoothness, and deceive others into a belief in its\r\nlack of matter by the very finish and brilliancy of its form. The show\r\npassages of the poem which are most generally known--the House of Pride,\r\nthe Cave of Despair, the Entrance of Belphoebe, the Treasury of Mammon, the\r\nGardens of Acrasia, the Sojourn of Britomart in Busirane's Castle, the\r\nMarriage of the Thames and Medway, the Discovery of the False Florimel,\r\nArtegall and the Giant, Calidore with Meliboeus, the Processions of the\r\nSeasons and the Months--all these are not, as is the case with so many\r\nother poets, mere purple patches, diversifying and relieving dullness, but\r\nrather remarkable, and as it happens easily separable examples of a power\r\nwhich is shown constantly and almost evenly throughout. Those who admire\r\nthem do well; but they hardly know Spenser. He, more than almost any other\r\npoet, must be read continuously and constantly till the eye and ear and\r\nmind have acquired the freedom of his realm of enchantment, and have learnt\r\nthe secret (as far as a mere reader may learn it) of the poetical spells\r\nby which he brings together and controls its wonders. The talk of\r\ntediousness, the talk of sameness, the talk of coterie-cultivation in\r\nSpenser shows bad taste no doubt; but it rather shows ignorance. The critic\r\nhas in such cases stayed outside his author; he speaks but of what he has\r\n_not_ seen.\r\n\r\nThe comparative estimate is always the most difficult in literature, and\r\nwhere it can be avoided it is perhaps best to avoid it. But in Spenser's\r\ncase this is not possible. He is one of those few who can challenge the\r\ntitle of \"greatest English poet,\" and the reader may almost of right demand\r\nthe opinion on this point of any one who writes about him. For my part I\r\nhave no intention of shirking the difficulty. It seems to me that putting\r\nShakespere aside as _hors concours_, not merely in degree but in kind, only\r\ntwo English poets can challenge Spenser for the primacy. These are Milton\r\nand Shelley. The poet of _The Faerie Queene_ is generally inferior to\r\nMilton in the faculty of concentration, and in the minting of those\r\nmonumental phrases, impressive of themselves and quite apart from the\r\ncontext, which often count highest in the estimation of poetry. His\r\nvocabulary and general style, if not more remote from the vernacular, have\r\nsometimes a touch of deliberate estrangement from that vernacular which is\r\nno doubt of itself a fault. His conception of a great work is looser, more\r\nexcursive, less dramatic. As compared with Shelley he lacks not merely the\r\nmodern touches which appeal to a particular age, but the lyrical ability in\r\nwhich Shelley has no equal among English poets. But in each case he redeems\r\nthese defects with, as it seems to me, far more than counterbalancing\r\nmerits. He is never prosaic as Milton, like his great successor Wordsworth,\r\nconstantly is, and his very faults are the faults of a poet. He never (as\r\nShelley does constantly) dissolves away into a flux of words which simply\r\nbids good-bye to sense or meaning, and wanders on at large, unguided,\r\nwithout an end, without an aim. But he has more than these merely negative\r\nmerits. I have seen long accounts of Spenser in which the fact of his\r\ninvention of the Spenserian stanza is passed over almost without a word of\r\ncomment. Yet in the formal history of poetry (and the history of poetry\r\nmust always be pre-eminently a history of form) there is simply no\r\nachievement so astonishing as this. That we do not know the inventors of\r\nthe great single poetic vehicles, the hexameter, the iambic Senarius, the\r\nEnglish heroic, the French Alexandrine, is one thing. It is another that in\r\nSpenser's case alone can the invention of a complicated but essentially\r\nintegral form be assigned to a given poet. It is impossible to say that\r\nSappho invented the Sapphic, or Alcaeus the Alcaic: each poet may have been\r\na Vespucci to some precedent Columbus. But we are in a position to say that\r\nSpenser did most unquestionably invent the English Spenserian stanza--a\r\nform only inferior in individual beauty to the sonnet, which is itself\r\npractically _adespoton_, and far superior to the sonnet in its capacity of\r\nbeing used in multiples as well as singly. When the unlikelihood of such a\r\ncomplicated measure succeeding in narrative form, the splendid success of\r\nit in The _Faerie Queene_, and the remarkable effects which have\r\nsubsequently been got out of it by men so different as Thomson, Shelley,\r\nand Lord Tennyson, are considered, Spenser's invention must, I think, be\r\ncounted the most considerable of its kind in literature.\r\n\r\nBut it may be very freely admitted that this technical merit, great as it\r\nis, is the least part of the matter. Whosoever first invented butterflies\r\nand pyramids in poetry is not greatly commendable, and if Spenser had done\r\nnothing but arrange a cunning combination of eight heroics, with interwoven\r\nrhymes and an Alexandrine to finish with, it may be acknowledged at once\r\nthat his claims to primacy would have to be dismissed at once. It is not\r\nso. Independently of _The Faerie Queene_ altogether he has done work which\r\nwe must go to Milton and Shelley themselves to equal. The varied and\r\nsingularly original strains of _The Calendar_, the warmth and delicacy\r\ncombined of the _Epithalamion_, the tone of mingled regret and wonder (not\r\ninferior in its characteristic Renaissance ring to Du Bellay's own) of _The\r\nRuins of Rome_, the different notes of the different minor poems, are all\r\nthings not to be found in any minor poet. But as does not always happen,\r\nand as is perhaps not the case with Milton, Spenser's greatest work is also\r\nhis best. In the opinion of some at any rate the poet of _Lycidas_, of\r\n_Comus_, of _Samson Agonistes_, even of the _Allegro_ and _Penseroso_,\r\nranks as high as, if not above, the poet of _Paradise Lost_. But the poet\r\nof _The Faerie Queene_ could spare all his minor works and lose only, as\r\nhas been said, quantity not quality of greatness. It is hardly necessary at\r\nthis time of day to repeat the demonstration that Macaulay in his famous\r\njibe only succeeded in showing that he had never read what he jibed at; and\r\nthough other decriers of Spenser's masterpiece may not have laid themselves\r\nopen to quite so crushing a retort, they seldom fail to show a somewhat\r\nsimilar ignorance. For the lover of poetry, for the reader who understands\r\nand can receive the poetic charm, the revelation of beauty in metrical\r\nlanguage, no English poem is the superior, or, range and variety being\r\nconsidered, the equal of _The Faerie Queene_. Take it up where you will,\r\nand provided only sufficient time (the reading of a dozen stanzas ought to\r\nsuffice to any one who has the necessary gifts of appreciation) be given to\r\nallow the soft dreamy versicoloured atmosphere to rise round the reader,\r\nthe languid and yet never monotonous music to gain his ear, the mood of\r\nmixed imagination and heroism, adventure and morality, to impress itself on\r\nhis mind, and the result is certain. To the influence of no poet are the\r\nfamous lines of Spenser's great nineteenth-century rival so applicable as\r\nto Spenser's own. The enchanted boat, angel-guided, floating on away, afar,\r\nwithout conscious purpose, but simply obeying the instinct of sweet poetry,\r\nis not an extravagant symbol for the mind of a reader of Spenser. If such\r\nreaders want \"Criticisms of Life\" first of all, they must go elsewhere,\r\nthough they will find them amply given, subject to the limitations of the\r\npoetical method. If they want story they may complain of slackness and\r\ndeviations. If they want glorifications of science and such like things,\r\nthey had better shut the book at once, and read no more on that day nor on\r\nany other. But if they want poetry--if they want to be translated from a\r\nworld which is not one of beauty only into one where the very uglinesses\r\nare beautiful, into a world of perfect harmony in colour and sound, of an\r\nendless sequence of engaging event and character, of noble passions and\r\nactions not lacking their due contrast, then let them go to Spenser with a\r\ncertainty of satisfaction. He is not, as are some poets, the poet of a\r\ncertain time of life to the exclusion of others. He may be read in\r\nchildhood chiefly for his adventure, in later youth for his display of\r\nvoluptuous beauty, in manhood for his ethical and historical weight, in age\r\nfor all combined, and for the contrast which his bright universe of\r\ninvention affords with the work-day jejuneness of this troublesome world.\r\nBut he never palls upon those who have once learnt to taste him; and no\r\npoet is so little of an acquired taste to those who have any liking for\r\npoetry at all. He has been called the poet's poet--a phrase honourable but\r\na little misleading, inasmuch as it first suggests that he is not the poet\r\nof the great majority of readers who cannot pretend to be poets themselves,\r\nand secondly insinuates a kind of intellectual and aesthetic Pharisaism in\r\nthose who do admire him, which may be justly resented by those who do not.\r\nLet us rather say that he is the poet of all others for those who seek in\r\npoetry only poetical qualities, and we shall say not only what is more than\r\nenough to establish his greatness but what, as I for one believe, can be\r\nmaintained in the teeth of all gainsayers.[23]\r\n\r\n[23] Of Spenser as of two other poets in this volume, Shakespere and\r\nMilton, it seemed to be unnecessary and even impertinent to give any\r\nextracts. Their works are, or ought to be, in all hands; and even if it\r\nwere not so, no space at my command could give sample of their infinite\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nThe volume, variety, and vigour of the poetical production of the period in\r\nwhich Spenser is the central figure--the last twenty years of the sixteenth\r\ncentury--is perhaps proportionally the greatest, and may be said to be\r\nemphatically the most distinguished in purely poetical characteristics of\r\nany period in our history. Every kind of poetical work is represented in\r\nit, and every kind (with the possible exception of the semi-poetical kind\r\nof satire) is well represented. There is, indeed, no second name that\r\napproaches Spenser's, either in respect of importance or in respect of\r\nuniform excellence of work. But in the most incomplete production of this\r\ntime there is almost always that poetical spark which is often entirely\r\nwanting in the finished and complete work of other periods. I shall,\r\ntherefore, divide the whole mass into four groups, each with certain\r\ndistinguished names at its head, and a crowd of hardly undistinguished\r\nnames in its rank and file. These four groups are the sonneteers, the\r\nhistorians, the satirists, and lastly, the miscellaneous lyrists and\r\npoetical miscellanists.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is only recently that its mass and its beauty have been fully\r\nrecognised, the extraordinary outburst of sonnet-writing at a certain\r\nperiod of Elizabeth's reign has always attracted the attention of literary\r\nhistorians. For many years after Wyatt and Surrey's work appeared the form\r\nattracted but little imitation or practice. About 1580 Spenser himself\r\nprobably, Sidney and Thomas Watson certainly, devoted much attention to it;\r\nbut it was some dozen years later that the most striking crop of sonnets\r\nappeared. Between 1593 and 1596 there were published more than a dozen\r\ncollections, chiefly or wholly of sonnets, and almost all bearing the name\r\nof a single person, in whose honour they were supposed to be composed. So\r\nsingular is this coincidence, showing either an intense _engouement_ in\r\nliterary society, or a spontaneous determination of energy in individuals,\r\nthat the list with dates is worth giving. It runs thus:--In 1593 came\r\nBarnes's _Parthenophil and Parthenophe_, Fletcher's _Licia_, and Lodge's\r\n_Phillis_. In 1594 followed Constable's _Diana_, Daniel's _Delia_,[24] the\r\nanonymous _Zepheria_, Drayton's _Idea_, Percy's _Coelia_, and Willoughby's\r\n_Avisa_; 1595 added the _Alcilia_ of a certain J. C., and Spenser's perfect\r\n_Amoretti_; 1596 gave Griffin's _Fidessa_, Lynch's _Diella_, and Smith's\r\n_Chloris_, while Shakespere's earliest sonnets were probably not much\r\nlater. Then the fashion changed, or the vein was worked out, or (more\r\nfancifully) the impossibility of equalling Spenser and Shakespere choked\r\noff competitors. The date of Lord Brooke's singular _Coelica_, not\r\npublished till long afterwards, is uncertain; but he may, probably, be\r\nclassed with Sidney and Watson in period.\r\n\r\n[24] _Delia_ had appeared earlier in 1592, and partially in 1591; but the\r\ntext of 1594 is the definitive one. Several of these dates are doubtful or\r\ndisputed.\r\n\r\nFulke, or, as he himself spelt it, Foulke Greville, in his later years Lord\r\nBrooke,[25] was of a noble house in Warwickshire connected with the\r\nBeauchamps and the Willoughbys. He was born in 1554, was educated at\r\nShrewsbury with Philip Sidney, whose kinsman, lifelong friend, and first\r\nbiographer he was--proceeded, not like Sidney to Oxford, but to Cambridge\r\n(where he was a member, it would seem, of Jesus College, not as usually\r\nsaid of Trinity)--received early lucrative preferments chiefly in\r\nconnection with the government of Wales, was a favourite courtier of\r\nElizabeth's during all her later life, and, obtaining a royal gift of\r\nWarwick Castle, became the ancestor of the present earls of Warwick. In\r\n1614 he became Chancellor of the Exchequer. Lord Brooke, who lived to a\r\nconsiderable age, was stabbed in a rather mysterious manner in 1628 by a\r\nservant named Haywood, who is said to have been enraged by discovering that\r\nhis master had left him nothing in his will. The story is, as has been\r\nsaid, mysterious, and the affair seems to have been hushed up. Lord Brooke\r\nwas not universally popular, and a very savage contemporary epitaph on him\r\nhas been preserved. But he had been the patron of the youthful Davenant,\r\nand has left not a little curious literary work, which has only been\r\nrecently collected, and little of which saw the light in his own lifetime.\r\nOf his two singular plays, _Mustapha_ and _Alaham_ (closet-dramas having\r\nsomething in common with the Senecan model), _Mustapha_ was printed in\r\n1609; but it would seem piratically. His chief prose work, the _Life of\r\nSidney_, was not printed till 1652. His chief work in verse, the singular\r\n_Poems of Monarchy_ (ethical and political treatises), did not appear till\r\neighteen years later, as well as the allied _Treatise on Religion_. But\r\npoems or tracts on human learning, on wars, and other things, together with\r\nhis tragedies as above, had appeared in 1633. This publication, a folio\r\nvolume, also contained by far the most interesting part of his work, the\r\nso-called sonnet collection of Coelica--a medley, like many of those\r\nmentioned in this chapter, of lyrics and short poems of all lengths and\r\nmetrical arrangements, but, unlike almost all of them, dealing with many\r\nsubjects, and apparently addressed to more than one person. It is here, and\r\nin parts of the prose, that the reader who has not a very great love for\r\nElizabethan literature and some experience of it, can be recommended to\r\nseek confirmation of the estimate in which Greville was held by Charles\r\nLamb, and of the very excusable and pious, though perhaps excessive,\r\nadmiration of his editor Dr. Grosart. Even _Coelica_ is very unlikely to\r\nfind readers as a whole, owing to the strangely repellent character of\r\nBrooke's thought, which is intricate and obscure, and of his style, which\r\nis at any rate sometimes as harsh and eccentric as the theories of poetry\r\nwhich made him compose verse-treatises on politics. Nevertheless there is\r\nmuch nobility of thought and expression in him, and not unfrequent flashes\r\nof real poetry, while his very faults are characteristic. He may be\r\nrepresented here by a piece from _Coelica_, in which he is at his very\r\nbest, and most poetical because most simple--\r\n\r\n[25] He is a little liable to be confounded with two writers (brothers of a\r\npatronymic the same as his title) Samuel and Christopher Brooke, the latter\r\nof whom wrote poems of some merit, which Dr. Grosart has edited.\r\n\r\n    \"I, with whose colours Myra dressed her head,\r\n    I, that ware posies of her own hand making,\r\n    I, that mine own name in the chimnies read\r\n    By Myra finely wrought ere I was waking:\r\n    Must I look on, in hope time coming may\r\n    With change bring back my turn again to play?\r\n\r\n    \"I, that on Sunday at the church-stile found\r\n    A garland sweet with true love knots in flowers,\r\n    Which I to wear about mine arms, was bound\r\n    That each of us might know that all was ours:\r\n    Must I lead now an idle life in wishes,\r\n    And follow Cupid for his loaves and fishes?\r\n\r\n    \"I, that did wear the ring her mother left,\r\n    I, for whose love she gloried to be blamed,\r\n    I, with whose eyes her eyes committed theft,\r\n    I, who did make her blush when I was named:\r\n    Must I lose ring, flowers, blush, theft, and go naked,\r\n    Watching with sighs till dead love be awaked?\r\n\r\n    \"I, that when drowsy Argus fell asleep,\r\n    Like jealousy o'erwatched with desire,\r\n    Was ever warned modesty to keep\r\n    While her breath, speaking, kindled Nature's fire:\r\n    Must I look on a-cold while others warm them?\r\n    Do Vulcan's brothers in such fine nets arm them?\r\n\r\n    \"Was it for this that I might Myra see\r\n    _Washing the water with her beauties white_?\r\n    Yet would she never write her love to me:\r\n    Thinks wit of change when thoughts are in delight?\r\n    Mad girls may safely love as they may leave;\r\n    No man can print a kiss: lines may deceive.\"\r\n\r\nHad Brooke always written with this force and directness he would have been\r\na great poet. As it is, he has but the ore of poetry, not the smelted\r\nmetal.\r\n\r\nFor there is no doubt that Sidney here holds the primacy, not merely in\r\ntime but in value, of the whole school, putting Spenser and Shakespere\r\naside. That thirty or forty years' diligent study of Italian models had\r\nmuch to do with the extraordinary advance visible in his sonnets over those\r\nof Tottel's _Miscellany_ is, no doubt, undeniable. But many causes besides\r\nthe inexplicable residuum of fortunate inspiration, which eludes the most\r\ncareful search into literary cause and effect, had to do with the\r\nproduction of the \"lofty, insolent, and passionate vein,\" which becomes\r\nnoticeable in English poetry for the first time about 1580, and which\r\ndominates it, if we include the late autumn-summer of Milton's last\r\nproductions, for a hundred years. Perhaps it is not too much to say that\r\nthis makes its very first appearance in Sidney's verse, for _The Shepherd's\r\nCalendar_, though of an even more perfect, is of a milder strain. The\r\ninevitable tendency of criticism to gossip about poets instead of\r\ncriticising poetry has usually mixed a great deal of personal matter with\r\nthe accounts of _Astrophel and Stella_, the series of sonnets which is\r\nSidney's greatest literary work, and which was first published some years\r\nafter his death in an incorrect and probably pirated edition by Thomas\r\nNash. There is no doubt that there was a real affection between Sidney\r\n(Astrophel) and Penelope Devereux (Stella), daughter of the Earl of Essex,\r\nafterwards Lady Rich, and that marriage proving unhappy, Lady Mountjoy. But\r\nthe attempts which have been made to identify every hint and allusion in\r\nthe series with some fact or date, though falling short of the unimaginable\r\nfolly of scholastic labour-lost which has been expended on the sonnets of\r\nShakespere, still must appear somewhat idle to those who know the usual\r\ngenesis of love-poetry--how that it is of imagination all compact, and that\r\nactual occurrences are much oftener occasions and bases than causes and\r\nmaterial of it. It is of the smallest possible importance or interest to a\r\nrational man to discover what was the occasion of Sidney's writing these\r\ncharming poems--the important point is their charm. And in this respect\r\n(giving heed to his date and his opportunities of imitation) I should put\r\nSidney third to Shakespere and Spenser. The very first piece of the series,\r\nan oddly compounded sonnet of thirteen Alexandrines and a final heroic,\r\nstrikes the note of intense and fresh poetry which is only heard afar off\r\nin Surrey and Wyatt, which is hopelessly to seek in the tentatives of\r\nTurberville and Googe, and which is smothered with jejune and merely\r\nliterary ornament in the less formless work of Sidney's contemporary,\r\nThomas Watson. The second line--\r\n\r\n    \"That she, dear she, might take some pleasure of my pain,\"\r\n\r\nthe couplet--\r\n\r\n    \"Oft turning others' leaves to see if thence would flow\r\n    Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburnt brain,\"\r\n\r\nand the sudden and splendid finale--\r\n\r\n    \"'Fool!' said my muse, 'look in thy heart and write!'\"\r\n\r\nare things that may be looked for in vain earlier.\r\n\r\nA little later we meet with that towering soar of verse which is also\r\npeculiar to the period:\r\n\r\n    \"When Nature made her chief work--Stella's eyes,\r\n    In colour black why wrapt she beams so bright?\"--\r\n\r\nlines which those who deprecate insistence on the importance of form in\r\npoetry might study with advantage, for the thought is a mere commonplace\r\nconceit, and the beauty of the phrase is purely derived from the cunning\r\narrangement and cadence of the verse. The first perfectly charming sonnet\r\nin the English language--a sonnet which holds its own after three centuries\r\nof competition--is the famous \"With how sad steps, O moon, thou climbst the\r\nskies,\" where Lamb's stricture on the last line as obscure seems to me\r\nunreasonable. The equally famous phrase, \"That sweet enemy France,\" which\r\noccurs a little further on is another, and whether borrowed from Giordano\r\nBruno or not is perhaps the best example of the felicity of expression in\r\nwhich Sidney is surpassed by few Englishmen. Nor ought the extraordinary\r\nvariety of the treatment to be missed. Often as Sidney girds at those who,\r\nlike Watson, \"dug their sonnets out of books,\" he can write in the learned\r\nliterary manner with the best. The pleasant ease of his sonnet to the\r\nsparrow, \"Good brother Philip,\" contrasts in the oddest way with his\r\nallegorical and mythological sonnets, in each of which veins he indulges\r\nhardly less often, though very much more wisely than any of his\r\ncontemporaries. Nor do the other \"Songs of variable verse,\" which follow,\r\nand in some editions are mixed up with the sonnets, display less\r\nextraordinary power. The first song, with its refrain in the penultimate\r\nline of each stanza,\r\n\r\n    \"To you, to you, all song of praise is due,\"\r\n\r\ncontrasts in its throbbing and burning life with the faint and misty\r\nimagery, the stiff and wooden structure, of most of the verse of Sidney's\r\npredecessors, and deserves to be given in full:--\r\n\r\n    \"Doubt you to whom my Muse these notes intendeth;\r\n    Which now my breast o'ercharged to music lendeth?\r\n      To you! to you! all song of praise is due:\r\n    Only in you my song begins and endeth.\r\n\r\n    \"Who hath the eyes which marry state with pleasure,\r\n    Who keeps the keys of Nature's chiefest treasure?\r\n      To you! to you! all song of praise is due:\r\n    Only for you the heaven forgat all measure.\r\n\r\n    \"Who hath the lips, where wit in fairness reigneth?\r\n    Who womankind at once both decks and staineth?\r\n      To you! to you! all song of praise is due:\r\n    Only by you Cupid his crown maintaineth.\r\n\r\n    \"Who hath the feet, whose steps all sweetness planteth?\r\n    Who else; for whom Fame worthy trumpets wanteth?\r\n      To you! to you! all song of praise is due:\r\n    Only to you her sceptre Venus granteth.\r\n\r\n    \"Who hath the breast, whose milk doth passions nourish?\r\n    Whose grace is such, that when it chides doth cherish?\r\n      To you! to you! all song of praise is due:\r\n    Only through you the tree of life doth flourish.\r\n\r\n    \"Who hath the hand, which without stroke subdueth?\r\n    Who long dead beauty with increase reneweth?\r\n      To you! to you! all song of praise is due:\r\n    Only at you all envy hopeless rueth.\r\n\r\n    \"Who hath the hair, which loosest fastest tieth?\r\n    Who makes a man live then glad when he dieth?\r\n      To you! to you! all song of praise is due:\r\n    Only of you the flatterer never lieth.\r\n\r\n    \"Who hath the voice, which soul from senses sunders?\r\n    Whose force but yours the bolts of beauty thunders?\r\n      To you! to you! all song of praise is due:\r\n    Only with you not miracles are wonders.\r\n\r\n    \"Doubt you to whom my Muse these notes intendeth?\r\n    Which now my breast o'ercharged to music lendeth?\r\n      To you! to you! all song of praise is due:\r\n    Only in you my song begins and endeth.\"\r\n\r\nNor is its promise belied by those which follow, and which are among the\r\nearliest and the most charming of the rich literature of songs that really\r\nare songs--songs to music--which the age was to produce. All the scanty\r\nremnants of his other verse are instinct with the same qualities,\r\nespecially the splendid dirge, \"Ring out your bells, let mourning shows be\r\nspread,\" and the pretty lines \"to the tune of Wilhelmus van Nassau.\" I must\r\nquote the first:--\r\n\r\n    \"Ring out your bells! let mourning shows be spread,\r\n              For Love is dead.\r\n          All love is dead, infected\r\n            With the plague of deep disdain;\r\n          Worth as nought worth rejected.\r\n            And faith, fair scorn doth gain.\r\n          From so ungrateful fancy,\r\n          From such a female frenzy,\r\n          From them that use men thus,\r\n          Good Lord, deliver us!\r\n\r\n    \"Weep, neighbours, weep! Do you not hear it said\r\n              That Love is dead?\r\n          His deathbed, peacock's Folly;\r\n            His winding-sheet is Shame;\r\n          His will, False Seeming wholly;\r\n            His sole executor, Blame.\r\n          From so ungrateful fancy,\r\n          From such a female frenzy,\r\n          From them that use men thus,\r\n          Good Lord, deliver us!\r\n\r\n    \"Let dirge be sung, and trentals rightly read,\r\n              For Love is dead.\r\n          Sir Wrong his tomb ordaineth\r\n            My mistress' marble heart;\r\n          Which epitaph containeth\r\n            'Her eyes were once his dart.'\r\n          From so ungrateful fancy,\r\n          From such a female frenzy,\r\n          From them that use men thus,\r\n          Good Lord, deliver us!\r\n\r\n    \"Alas, I lie. Rage hath this error bred,\r\n              Love is not dead.\r\n          Love is not dead, but sleepeth\r\n            In her unmatched mind:\r\n          Where she his counsel keepeth\r\n            Till due deserts she find.\r\n          Therefore from so vile fancy\r\n          To call such wit a frenzy,\r\n          Who love can temper thus,\r\n          Good Lord, deliver us!\"\r\n\r\nThe verse from the _Arcadia_ (which contains a great deal of verse) has\r\nbeen perhaps injuriously affected in the general judgment by the fact that\r\nit includes experiments in the impossible classical metres. But both it and\r\nthe Translations from the Psalms express the same poetical faculty employed\r\nwith less directness and force. To sum up, there is no Elizabethan poet,\r\nexcept the two named, who is more unmistakably imbued with poetical quality\r\nthan Sidney. And Hazlitt's judgment on him, that he is \"jejune\" and\r\n\"frigid\" will, as Lamb himself hinted, long remain the chiefest and most\r\nastonishing example of a great critic's aberrations when his prejudices are\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nHad Hazlitt been criticising Thomas Watson, his judgment, though harsh,\r\nwould have been not wholly easy to quarrel with. It is probably the\r\nexcusable but serious error of judgment which induced his rediscoverer,\r\nProfessor Arber, to rank Watson above Sidney in gifts and genius, that has\r\nled other critics to put him unduly low. Watson himself, moreover, has\r\ninvited depreciation by his extreme frankness in confessing that his\r\n_Passionate Century_ is not a record of passion at all, but an elaborate\r\nliterary _pastiche_ after this author and that. I fear it must be admitted\r\nthat the average critic is not safely to be trusted with such an avowal of\r\nwhat he is too much disposed to advance as a charge without confession.\r\nWatson, of whom as usual scarcely anything is known personally, was a\r\nLondoner by birth, an Oxford man by education, a friend of most of the\r\nearlier literary school of the reign, such as Lyly, Peele, and Spenser,\r\nand a tolerably industrious writer both in Latin and English during his\r\nshort life, which can hardly have begun before 1557, and was certainly\r\nclosed by 1593. He stands in English poetry as the author of the\r\n_Hecatompathia_ or _Passionate Century_ of sonnets (1582), and the _Tears\r\nof Fancy_, consisting of sixty similar poems, printed after his death. The\r\n_Tears of Fancy_ are regular quatorzains, the pieces composing the\r\n_Hecatompathia_, though called sonnets, are in a curious form of eighteen\r\nlines practically composed of three six-line stanzas rhymed A B, A B, C C,\r\nand not connected by any continuance of rhyme from stanza to stanza. The\r\nspecial and peculiar oddity of the book is, that each sonnet has a prose\r\npreface as thus: \"In this passion the author doth very busily imitate and\r\naugment a certain ode of Ronsard, which he writeth unto his mistress. He\r\nbeginneth as followeth, _Plusieurs_, etc.\" Here is a complete example of\r\none of Watson's pages:--\r\n\r\n     \"There needeth no annotation at all before this passion, it is of\r\n     itself so plain and easily conveyed. Yet the unlearned may have\r\n     this help given them by the way to know what Galaxia is or\r\n     Pactolus, which perchance they have not read of often in our\r\n     vulgar rhymes. Galaxia (to omit both the etymology and what the\r\n     philosophers do write thereof) is a white way or milky circle in\r\n     the heavens, which Ovid mentioneth in this manner--\r\n\r\n    _Est via sublimis coelo manifesta sereno,_\r\n    _Lactea nomen habet, candore notabilis ipso._\r\n\r\n                             --Metamorph. lib. 1.\r\n\r\n     And Cicero thus in Somnio Scipionis: _Erat autem is splendissimo\r\n     candore inter flammas circulus elucens, quem vos (ut a Graijs\r\n     accepistis) orbem lacteum nuncupatis._\r\n\r\n     Pactolus is a river in Lydia, which hath golden sands under it,\r\n     as Tibullus witnesseth in this verse:--\r\n\r\n    _Nec me regna juvant, nec Lydius aurifer amnis._--Tibul. lib. 3.\r\n\r\n    Who can recount the virtues of my dear,\r\n    Or say how far her fame hath taken flight,\r\n    That cannot tell how many stars appear\r\n    In part of heaven, which Galaxia hight,\r\n      Or number all the moats in Phoebus' rays,\r\n      Or golden sands whereon Pactolus plays?\r\n\r\n    And yet my hurts enforce me to confess,\r\n    In crystal breast she shrouds a bloody heart,\r\n    Which heart in time will make her merits less,\r\n    Unless betimes she cure my deadly smart:\r\n      For now my life is double dying still,\r\n      And she defamed by sufferance of such ill;\r\n\r\n    And till the time she helps me as she may,\r\n    Let no man undertake to tell my toil,\r\n    But only such, as can distinctly say,\r\n    What monsters Nilus breeds, or Afric soil:\r\n      For if he do, his labour is but lost,\r\n      Whilst I both fry and freeze 'twixt flame and frost.\"\r\n\r\nNow this is undoubtedly, as Watson's contemporaries would have said, \"a\r\ncooling card\" to the reader, who is thus presented with a series of\r\nelaborate poetical exercises affecting the acutest personal feeling, and\r\nyet confessedly representing no feeling at all. Yet the _Hecatompathia_ is\r\nremarkable, both historically and intrinsically. It does not seem likely\r\nthat at its publication the author can have had anything of Sidney's or\r\nmuch of Spenser's before him; yet his work is only less superior to the\r\nwork of their common predecessors than the work of these two. By far the\r\nfinest of his _Century_ is the imitation of Ferrabosco--\r\n\r\n    \"Resolved to dust intombed here lieth love.\"\r\n\r\nThe quatorzains of the _Tears of Fancy_ are more attractive in form and\r\nless artificial in structure and phraseology, but it must be remembered\r\nthat by their time Sidney's sonnets were known and Spenser had written\r\nmuch. The seed was scattered abroad, and it fell in congenial soil in\r\nfalling on Watson, but the _Hecatompathia_ was self-sown.\r\n\r\nThis difference shows itself very remarkably in the vast outburst of\r\nsonneteering which, as has been remarked, distinguished the middle of the\r\nlast decade of the sixteenth century. All these writers had Sidney and\r\nSpenser before them, and they assume so much of the character of a school\r\nthat there are certain subjects, for instance, \"Care-charming sleep,\" on\r\nwhich many of them (after Sidney) composed sets of rival poems, almost as\r\ndefinitely competitive as the sonnets of the later \"Uranie et Job\" and\r\n\"Belle Matineuse\" series in France. Nevertheless, there is in all of\r\nthem--what as a rule is wanting in this kind of clique verse--the\r\nindependent spirit, the original force which makes poetry. The Smiths and\r\nthe Fletchers, the Griffins and the Lynches, are like little geysers round\r\nthe great ones: the whole soil is instinct with fire and flame. We shall,\r\nhowever, take the production of the four remarkable years 1593-1596\r\nseparately, and though in more than one case we shall return upon their\r\nwriters both in this chapter and in a subsequent one, the unity of the\r\nsonnet impulse seems to demand separate mention for them here.\r\n\r\nIn 1593 the influence of the Sidney poems (published, it must be\r\nremembered, in 1591) was new, and the imitators, except Watson (of whom\r\nabove), display a good deal of the quality of the novice. The chief of them\r\nare Barnabe Barnes, with his _Parthenophil and Parthenophe_, Giles Fletcher\r\n(father of the Jacobean poets, Giles and Phineas Fletcher), with his\r\n_Licia_, and Thomas Lodge, with his _Phillis_. Barnes is a modern\r\ndiscovery, for before Dr. Grosart reprinted him in 1875, from the unique\r\noriginal at Chatsworth, for thirty subscribers only (of whom I had the\r\nhonour to be one), he was practically unknown. Mr. Arber has since, in his\r\n_English Garner_, opened access to a wider circle, to whom I at least do\r\nnot grudge their entry. As with most of these minor Elizabethan poets,\r\nBarnes is a very obscure person. A little later than _Parthenophil_ he\r\nwrote _A Divine Centurie of Spiritual Sonnets_, having, like many of his\r\ncontemporaries, an apparent desire poetically to make the best of both\r\nworlds. He also wrote a wild play in the most daring Elizabethan style,\r\ncalled _The Devil's Charter_, and a prose political _Treatise of Offices_.\r\nBarnes was a friend of Gabriel Harvey's, and as such met with some rough\r\nusage from Nash, Marston, and others. His poetical worth, though there are\r\nfine passages in _The Devil's Charter_ and in the _Divine Centurie_, must\r\nrest on _Parthenophil_. This collection consists not merely of sonnets but\r\nof madrigals, sestines, canzons, and other attempts after Italian masters.\r\nThe style, both verbal and poetical, needs chastising in places, and\r\nBarnes's expression in particular is sometimes obscure. He is sometimes\r\ncomic when he wishes to be passionate, and frequently verbose when he\r\nwishes to be expressive. But the fire, the full-bloodedness, the poetical\r\nvirility, of the poems is extraordinary. A kind of intoxication of the\r\neternal-feminine seems to have seized the poet to an extent not otherwise\r\nto be paralleled in the group, except in Sidney; while Sidney's courtly\r\nsense of measure and taste did not permit him Barnes's forcible\r\nextravagances. Here is a specimen:--\r\n\r\n    \"Phoebus, rich father of eternal light,\r\n    And in his hand a wreath of Heliochrise\r\n      He brought, to beautify those tresses,\r\n    Whose train, whose softness, and whose gloss more bright,\r\n          Apollo's locks did overprize.\r\n    Thus, with this garland, whiles her brows he blesses,\r\n          The golden shadow with his tincture\r\n          Coloured her locks, aye gilded with the cincture.\"\r\n\r\nGiles Fletcher's _Licia_ is a much more pale and colourless performance,\r\nthough not wanting in merit. The author, who was afterwards a most\r\nrespectable clergyman, is of the class of _amoureux transis_, and dies for\r\nLicia throughout his poems, without apparently suspecting that it was much\r\nbetter to live for her. His volume contained some miscellaneous poems, with\r\na dullish essay in the historical style (see _post_), called _The Rising of\r\nRichard to the Crown_. Very far superior is Lodge's _Phillis_, the chief\r\npoetical work of that interesting person, except some of the madrigals and\r\nodd pieces of verse scattered about his prose tracts (for which see Chapter\r\nVI.) _Phillis_ is especially remarkable for the grace and refinement with\r\nwhich the author elaborates the Sidneian model. Lodge, indeed, as it seems\r\nto me, was one of the not uncommon persons who can always do best with a\r\nmodel before them. He euphuised with better taste than Lyly, but in\r\nimitation of him; his tales in prose are more graceful than those of\r\nGreene, whom he copied; it at least seems likely that he out-Marlowed\r\nMarlowe in the rant of the _Looking-Glass for London_, and the stiffness of\r\nthe _Wounds of Civil War_, and he chiefly polished Sidney in his sonnets\r\nand madrigals. It is not to be denied, however, that in three out of these\r\nfour departments he gave us charming work. His mixed allegiance to Marlowe\r\nand Sidney gave him command of a splendid form of decasyllable, which\r\nappears often in _Phillis_, as for instance--\r\n\r\n    \"About thy neck do all the graces throng\r\n    And lay such baits as might entangle death,\"\r\n\r\nwhere it is worth noting that the whole beauty arises from the dexterous\r\nplacing of the dissyllable \"graces,\" and the trisyllable \"entangle,\"\r\nexactly where they ought to be among the monosyllables of the rest. The\r\nmadrigals \"Love guards the roses of thy lips,\" \"My Phillis hath the morning\r\nsun,\" and \"Love in my bosom like a bee\" are simply unsurpassed for sugared\r\nsweetness in English. Perhaps this is the best of them:--\r\n\r\n    \"Love in my bosom like a bee,\r\n          Doth suck his sweet;\r\n    Now with his wings he plays with me,\r\n          Now with his feet.\r\n    Within mine eyes he makes his nest\r\n    His bed amidst my tender breast,\r\n    My kisses are his daily feast;\r\n    And yet he robs me of my rest?\r\n        'Ah, wanton! will ye?'\r\n\r\n    \"And if I sleep, then percheth he,\r\n          With pretty flight,[26]\r\n    And makes his pillow of my knee\r\n          The livelong night.\r\n    Strike I my lute, he tunes the string.\r\n    He music plays, if so I sing.\r\n    He lends me every lovely thing\r\n    Yet cruel! he, my heart doth sting.\r\n        'Whist, wanton! still ye!'\r\n\r\n    \"Else I with roses, every day\r\n          Will whip you hence,\r\n    And bind you, when you want to play,\r\n          For your offence.\r\n    I'll shut my eyes to keep you in,\r\n    I'll make you fast it for your sin,\r\n    I'll count your power not worth a pin.\r\n    Alas, what hereby shall I win\r\n        If he gainsay me?\r\n\r\n    \"What if I beat the wanton boy\r\n          With many a rod?\r\n    He will repay me with annoy\r\n          Because a god.\r\n    Then sit thou safely on my knee,\r\n    And let thy bower my bosom be.\r\n    Lurk in mine eyes, I like of thee.\r\n    O Cupid! so thou pity me,\r\n        Spare not, but play thee.\"\r\n\r\n[26] Printed in _England's Helicon_ \"sleight.\"\r\n\r\n1594 was the most important of all the sonnet years, and here we are\r\nchiefly bound to mention authors who will come in for fuller notice later.\r\nThe singular book known as Willoughby's _Avisa_ which, as having a supposed\r\nbearing on Shakespere and as containing much of that personal puzzlement\r\nwhich rejoices critics, has had much attention of late years, is not\r\nstrictly a collection of sonnets; its poems being longer and of differing\r\nstanzas. But in general character it falls in with the sonnet-collections\r\naddressed or devoted to a real or fanciful personage. It is rather\r\nsatirical than panegyrical in character, and its poetical worth is very far\r\nfrom high. William Percy, a friend of Barnes (who dedicated the\r\n_Parthenophil_ to him), son of the eighth Earl of Northumberland, and a\r\nretired person who seems to have passed the greater part of a long life in\r\nOxford \"drinking nothing but ale,\" produced a very short collection\r\nentitled _Coelia_, not very noteworthy, though it contains (probably in\r\nimitation of Barnes) one of the tricky things called echo-sonnets, which,\r\nwith dialogue-sonnets and the like, have sometimes amused the leisure of\r\npoets. Much more remarkable is the singular anonymous collection called\r\n_Zepheria_. Its contents are called not sonnets but canzons, though most of\r\nthem are orthodox quatorzains somewhat oddly rhymed and rhythmed. It is\r\nbrief, extending only to forty pieces, and, like much of the poetry of the\r\nperiod, begins and ends with Italian mottoes or dedication-phrases. But\r\nwhat is interesting about it is the evidence it gives of deep familiarity\r\nnot only with Italian but with French models. This appears both in such\r\nwords as \"jouissance,\" \"thesaurise,\" \"esperance,\" \"souvenance,\" \"vatical\"\r\n(a thoroughly Ronsardising word), with others too many to mention, and in\r\nother characteristics. Mr. Sidney Lee, in his most valuable collection of\r\nthese sonneteers, endeavours to show that this French influence was less\r\nuncommon than has sometimes been thought. Putting this aside, the\r\ncharacteristic of _Zepheria_ is unchastened vigour, full of promise, but\r\ndecidedly in need of further schooling and discipline, as the following\r\nwill show:--\r\n\r\n    \"O then Desire, father of Jouissance,\r\n    The Life of Love, the Death of dastard Fear,\r\n    The kindest nurse to true perseverance,\r\n    Mine heart inherited, with thy love's revere. [?]\r\n    Beauty! peculiar parent of Conceit,\r\n    Prosperous midwife to a travelling muse,\r\n    The sweet of life, Nepenthe's eyes receipt,\r\n    Thee into me distilled, O sweet, infuse!\r\n    Love then (the spirit of a generous sprite,\r\n    An infant ever drawing Nature's breast,\r\n    The Sum of Life, that Chaos did unnight!)\r\n    Dismissed mine heart from me, with thee to rest.\r\n    And now incites me cry, 'Double or quit!\r\n    Give back my heart, or take his body to it!'\"\r\n\r\nThis cannot be said of the three remarkable collections yet to be noticed\r\nwhich appeared in this year, to wit, Constable's _Diana_, Daniel's _Delia_,\r\nand Drayton's _Idea_. These three head the group and contain the best work,\r\nafter Shakespere and Spenser and Sidney, in the English sonnet of the time.\r\nConstable's sonnets had appeared partly in 1592, and as they stand in\r\nfullest collection were published in or before 1594. Afterwards he wrote,\r\nlike others, \"divine\" sonnets (he was a Roman Catholic) and some\r\nmiscellaneous poems, including a very pretty \"Song of Venus and Adonis.\" He\r\nwas a close friend of Sidney, many of whose sonnets were published with\r\nhis, and his work has much of the Sidneian colour, but with fewer flights\r\nof happily expressed fancy. The best of it is probably the following\r\nsonnet, which is not only full of gracefully expressed images, but keeps up\r\nits flight from first to last--a thing not universal in these Elizabethan\r\nsonnets:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lady's presence makes the Roses red,\r\n    Because to see her lips they blush for shame.\r\n    The Lily's leaves, for envy, pale became;\r\n    And her white hands in them this envy bred.\r\n    The Marigold the leaves abroad doth spread;\r\n    Because the sun's and her power is the same.\r\n    The Violet of purple colour came,\r\n    Dyed in the blood she made my heart to shed.\r\n    In brief all flowers from her their virtue take;\r\n    From her sweet breath, their sweet smells do proceed;\r\n    The living heat which her eyebeams doth make\r\n    Warmeth the ground, and quickeneth the seed.\r\n    The rain, wherewith she watereth the flowers,\r\n    Falls from mine eyes, which she dissolves in showers.\"\r\n\r\nSamuel Daniel had an eminently contemplative genius which might have\r\nanticipated the sonnet as it is in Wordsworth, but which the fashion of the\r\nday confined to the not wholly suitable subject of Love. In the splendid\r\n\"Care-charmer Sleep,\" one of the tournament sonnets above noted, he\r\ncontrived, as will be seen, to put his subject under the influence of his\r\nprevailing faculty.\r\n\r\n    \"Care-charmer Sleep, son of the sable Night,\r\n      Brother to Death, in silent darkness born,\r\n    Relieve my anguish, and restore the light,\r\n      With dark forgetting of my cares, return;\r\n    And let the day be time enough to mourn\r\n      The shipwreck of my ill-adventured youth;\r\n    Let waking eyes suffice to wail their scorn\r\n      Without the torment of the night's untruth.\r\n    Cease, Dreams, th' imag'ry of our day-desires,\r\n      To model forth the passions of the morrow,\r\n    Never let rising sun approve you liars,\r\n      To add more grief to aggravate my sorrow.\r\n    Still let me sleep, embracing clouds in vain;\r\n    And never wake to feel the day's disdain.\"\r\n\r\nBut as a rule he is perhaps too much given to musing, and too little to\r\nrapture. In form he is important, as he undoubtedly did much to establish\r\nthe arrangement of three alternate rhymed quatrains and a couplet which, in\r\nShakespere's hands, was to give the noblest poetry of the sonnet and of the\r\nworld. He has also an abundance of the most exquisite single lines, such as\r\n\r\n    \"O clear-eyed rector of the holy hill,\"\r\n\r\nand the wonderful opening of Sonnet XXVII., \"The star of my mishap imposed\r\nthis pain.\"\r\n\r\nThe sixty-three sonnets, varied in different editions of Drayton's _Idea_,\r\nare among the most puzzling of the whole group. Their average value is not\r\nof the very highest. Yet there are here and there the strangest suggestions\r\nof Drayton's countryman, Shakespere, and there is one sonnet, No. 61,\r\nbeginning, \"Since there's no help, come let us kiss and part,\" which I have\r\nfound it most difficult to believe to be Drayton's, and which is Shakespere\r\nall over. That Drayton was the author of _Idea_ as a whole is certain, not\r\nmerely from the local allusions, but from the resemblance to the more\r\nsuccessful exercises of his clear, masculine, vigorous, fertile, but\r\noccasionally rather unpoetical style. The sonnet just referred to is itself\r\none of the very finest existing--perhaps one of the ten or twelve best\r\nsonnets in the world, and it may be worth while to give it with another in\r\ncontrast:--\r\n\r\n    \"Our flood's Queen, Thames, for ships and swans is crowned;\r\n      And stately Severn for her shore is praised.\r\n    The crystal Trent for fords and fish renowned;\r\n      And Avon's fame to Albion's cliffs is raised;\r\n    Carlegion Chester vaunts her holy Dee;\r\n      York many wonders of her Ouse can tell.\r\n    The Peak her Dove, whose banks so fertile be;\r\n      And Kent will say her Medway doth excel.\r\n    Cotswold commends her Isis to the Tame;\r\n      Our northern borders boast of Tweed's fair flood\r\n    Our western parts extol their Wily's fame;\r\n      And the old Lea brags of the Danish blood.\r\n    Arden's sweet Ankor, let thy glory be\r\n    That fair Idea only lives by thee!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Since there's no help, come, let us kiss and part!\r\n      Nay, I have done. You get no more of me\r\n    And I am glad, yea, glad with all my heart\r\n      That thus so cleanly I myself can free.\r\n    Shake hands for ever, cancel all our vows,\r\n      And when we meet at any time again\r\n    Be it not seen in either of our brows\r\n      That we one jot of former love retain.\r\n    Now at the last gasp of Love's latest breath,\r\n      When, his pulse failing, Passion speechless lies;\r\n    When Faith is kneeling by his bed of death,\r\n      And Innocence is closing up his eyes:\r\n    Now, if thou would'st, when all have given him over,\r\n    From death to life thou might'st him yet recover!\"\r\n\r\n1595 chiefly contributed the curious production called _Alcilia_, by J. C.,\r\nwho gives the name of sonnets to a series of six-line stanzas, varied\r\noccasionally by other forms, such as that of the following pretty verses.\r\nIt may be noted that the citation of proverbs is very characteristic of\r\n_Alcilia_:--\r\n\r\n    \"Love is sorrow mixed with gladness,\r\n    Fear with hope, and hope with madness.\r\n    Long did I love, but all in vain;\r\n    I loving, was not loved again:\r\n    For which my heart sustained much woe.\r\n    It fits not maids to use men so,\r\n    Just deserts are not regarded,\r\n    Never love so ill rewarded.\r\n    But 'all is lost that is not sought,'\r\n    'Oft wit proves best that's dearest bought.'\r\n\r\n    \"Women were made for men's relief;\r\n    To comfort, not to cause their grief.\r\n    Where most I merit, least I find:\r\n    No marvel, since that love is blind.\r\n    Had she been kind as she was fair,\r\n    My case had been more strange and rare.\r\n    But women love not by desert,\r\n    Reason in them hath weakest part.\r\n    Then henceforth let them love that list,\r\n    I will beware of 'had I wist.'\"\r\n\r\n1596 (putting the _Amoretti_, which is sometimes assigned to this year,\r\naside) was again fruitful with Griffin's _Fidessa_, Lynch's _Diella_, and\r\nSmith's _Chloris_. _Fidessa_, though distinctly \"young,\" is one of the most\r\ninteresting of the clearly imitative class of these sonnets, and contains\r\nsome very graceful poetry, especially the following, one of the Sleep\r\nclass, which will serve as a good example of the minor sonneteers:--\r\n\r\n    \"Care-charmer Sleep! sweet ease in restless misery!\r\n      The captive's liberty, and his freedom's song!\r\n    Balm of the bruised heart! man's chief felicity!\r\n      Brother of quiet Death, when Life is too too long!\r\n    A Comedy it is, and now an History;\r\n      What is not sleep unto the feeble mind?\r\n    It easeth him that toils, and him that's sorry;\r\n      It makes the deaf to hear; to see, the blind;\r\n    Ungentle Sleep! thou helpest all but me,\r\n      For when I sleep my soul is vexed most.\r\n    It is Fidessa that doth master thee\r\n      If she approach; alas! thy power is lost.\r\n    But here she is! See, how he runs amain!\r\n    I fear, at night, he will not come again.\"\r\n\r\n_Diella_, a set of thirty-eight sonnets prefixed to the \"Amorous poem of\r\nDiego and Genevra,\" is more elaborate in colouring but somewhat less fresh\r\nand genuine; while _Chloris_, whose author was a friend of Spenser's,\r\napproaches to the pastoral in the plan and phrasing of its fifty sonnets.\r\n\r\nSuch are the most remarkable members of a group of English poetry, which\r\nyields to few such groups in interest. It is connected by a strong\r\nsimilarity of feeling--if any one likes, even by a strong imitation of the\r\nsame models. But in following those models and expressing those feelings,\r\nits members, even the humblest of them, have shown remarkable poetical\r\ncapacity; while of the chiefs we can only say, as has been said more than\r\nonce already, that the matter and form together acknowledge, and indeed\r\nadmit of, no superior.\r\n\r\nIn close connection with these groups of sonnets, displaying very much the\r\nsame poetical characteristics and in some cases written by the same\r\nauthors, there occurs a great body of miscellaneous poetical writing\r\nproduced during the last twenty years of the sixteenth century, and ranging\r\nfrom long poems of the allegorical or amatory kind to the briefest lyrics\r\nand madrigals. Sometimes this work appeared independently; sometimes it was\r\ninserted in the plays and prose pamphlets of the time. As has already been\r\nsaid, some of our authors, notably Lodge and Greene, did in this way work\r\nwhich far exceeds in merit any of their more ambitious pieces, and which in\r\na certain unborrowed and incommunicable poetic grace hardly leaves anything\r\nof the time behind it. Shakespere himself, in _Venus and Adonis_ and\r\n_Lucrece_, has in a more elaborate but closely allied kind of poetry\r\ndisplayed less mature, but scarcely less, genius than in his dramatic and\r\nsonnet work. It is my own opinion that the actual poetical worth of Richard\r\nBarnfield, to whom an exquisite poem in _The Passionate Pilgrim_, long\r\nascribed to Shakespere, is now more justly assigned, has, owing to this\r\nassignment and to the singular character of his chief other poem, _The\r\nAffectionate Shepherd_, been considerably overrated. It is unfortunately as\r\ncomplete if not as common a mistake to suppose that any one who disdains\r\nhis country's morality must be a good poet, as to set down any one who\r\ndisdains it without further examination for a bad one. The simple fact, as\r\nit strikes a critic, is that \"As it fell upon a day\" is miles above\r\nanything else of Barnfield's, and is not like anything else of his, while\r\nit is very like things of Shakespere's. The best thing to be said for\r\nBarnfield is that he was an avowed and enthusiastic imitator and follower\r\nof Spenser. His poetical work (we might have included the short series of\r\nsonnets to _Cynthia_ in the division of sonneteers) was all written when he\r\nwas a very young man, and he died when he was not a very old one, a\r\nbachelor country-gentleman in Warwickshire. Putting the exquisite \"As it\r\nfell upon a day\" out of question (which, if he wrote it, is one of the not\r\nvery numerous examples of perfect poetry written by a very imperfect poet),\r\nBarnfield has, in no extraordinary measure, the common attributes of this\r\nwonderful time--poetical enthusiasm, fresh and unhackneyed expression,\r\nmetrical charm, and gorgeous colouring, which does not find itself\r\nill-matched with accurate drawing of nature. He is above the average\r\nElizabethan, and his very bad taste in _The Affectionate Shepherd_ (a\r\nfollowing of Virgil's Second Eclogue) may be excused as a humanist crotchet\r\nof the time. His rarity, his eccentricity, and the curious mixing up of his\r\nwork with Shakespere's have done him something more than yeoman's service\r\nwith recent critics. But he may have a specimen:--\r\n\r\n    \"And thus it happened: Death and Cupid met\r\n      Upon a time at swilling Bacchus' house,\r\n    Where dainty cates upon the board were set,\r\n      And goblets full of wine to drink carouse:\r\n        Where Love and Death did love the liquor so\r\n        That out they fall, and to the fray they go.\r\n\r\n    \"And having both their quivers at their back\r\n      Filled full of arrows--the one of fatal steel,\r\n    The other all of gold; Death's shaft was black,\r\n      But Love's was yellow--Fortune turned her wheel,\r\n        And from Death's quiver fell a fatal shaft\r\n        That under Cupid by the wind was waft.\r\n\r\n    \"And at the same time by ill hap there fell\r\n      Another arrow out of Cupid's quiver;\r\n    The which was carried by the wind at will,\r\n      And under Death the amorous shaft did shiver.[27]\r\n        They being parted, Love took up Death's dart,\r\n        And Death took up Love's arrow for his part.\"\r\n\r\n[27] Not, of course = \"break,\" but \"shudder.\"\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps more genuine poetic worth, though there is less\r\naccomplishment of form, in the unfortunate Father Robert Southwell, who was\r\nexecuted as a traitor on the 20th of February 1595. Southwell belonged to a\r\ndistinguished family, and was born (probably) at Horsham St. Faiths, in\r\nNorfolk, about the year 1560. He was stolen by a gipsy in his youth, but\r\nwas recovered; and a much worse misfortune befell him in being sent for\r\neducation not to Oxford or Cambridge but to Douay, where he got into the\r\nhands of the Jesuits, and joined their order. He was sent on a mission to\r\nEngland; and (no doubt conscientiously) violating the law there, was after\r\nsome years of hiding and suspicion betrayed, arrested, treated with great\r\nharshness in prison, and at last, as has been said, executed. No specific\r\nacts of treason were even charged against him; and he earnestly denied any\r\ndesigns whatever against the Queen and kingdom, nor can it be doubted that\r\nhe merely paid the penalty of others' misdeeds. His work both in prose and\r\npoetry was not inconsiderable, and the poetry was repeatedly printed in\r\nrather confusing and imperfect editions after his death. The longest, but\r\nby no means the best, piece is _St. Peter's Complaint_. The best\r\nunquestionably is _The Burning Babe_, which, though fairly well known, must\r\nbe given:--\r\n\r\n    \"As I in hoary winter's night stood shivering in the snow,\r\n    Surpris'd I was with sudden heat, which made my heart to glow;\r\n    And lifting up a fearful eye to view what fire was near,\r\n    A pretty Babe all burning bright, did in the air appear,\r\n    Who scorched with excessive heat, such floods of tears did shed,\r\n    As though His floods should quench His flames which with His tears were\r\n          fed;\r\n    'Alas!' quoth He, 'but newly born, in fiery heats I fry,\r\n    Yet none approach to warm their hearts or feel My fire but I!\r\n    My faultless breast the furnace is, the fuel wounding thorns,\r\n    Love is the fire, and sighs the smoke, the ashes shame and scorns;\r\n    The fuel Justice layeth on, and Mercy blows the coals;\r\n    The metal in this furnace wrought are men's defiled souls,\r\n    For which, as now on fire I am, to work them to their good\r\n    So will I melt into a bath to wash them in My blood:'\r\n    With these He vanished out of sight, and swiftly shrunk away,\r\n    And straight I called unto mind that it was Christmas Day.\"\r\n\r\nSomething of the glow of this appears elsewhere in the poems, which are,\r\nwithout exception, religious. They have not a little of the \"hectic\" tone,\r\nwhich marks still more strongly the chief English Roman Catholic poet of\r\nthe next century, Crashaw; but are never, as Crashaw sometimes is,\r\nhysterical. On the whole, as was remarked in a former chapter, they belong\r\nrather to the pre-Spenserian class in diction and metre, though with\r\nsomething of the Italian touch. Occasional roughnesses in them may be at\r\nleast partly attributed to the evident fact that the author thought of\r\nnothing less than of merely \"cultivating the muses.\" His religious fervour\r\nis of the simplest and most genuine kind, and his poems are a natural and\r\nunforced expression of it.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult in the brief space which can here be allotted to the\r\nsubject to pass in review the throng of miscellaneous poets and poetry\r\nindicated under this group. The reprints of Dr. Grosart and Mr. Arber,\r\nsupplemented in a few cases by recourse to the older recoveries of Brydges,\r\nHaslewood, Park, Collier, and others, bring before the student a mass of\r\nbrilliant and beautiful matter, often mixed with a good deal of slag and\r\nscoriae, but seldom deficient in the true poetical ore. The mere collections\r\nof madrigals and songs, actually intended for casual performance at a time\r\nwhen almost every accomplished and well-bred gentleman or lady was expected\r\nto oblige the company, which Mr. Arber's invaluable _English Garner_ and\r\nMr. Bullen's _Elizabethan Lyrics_ give from the collections edited or\r\nproduced by Byrd, Yonge, Campion, Dowland, Morley, Alison, Wilbye, and\r\nothers, represent such a body of verse as probably could not be got\r\ntogether, with the same origin and circumstances, in any quarter-century of\r\nany nation's history since the foundation of the world. In Campion\r\nespecially the lyrical quality is extraordinary. He was long almost\r\ninaccessible, but Mr. Bullen's edition of 1889 has made knowledge of him\r\neasy. His birth-year is unknown, but he died in 1620. He was a Cambridge\r\nman, a member of the Inns of Court, and a physician in good practice. He\r\nhas left us a masque; four _Books of Airs_ (1601-17?), in which the gems\r\ngiven below, and many others, occur; and a sometimes rather unfairly\r\ncharacterised critical treatise, _Observations on the Art of English\r\nPoesy_, in which he argues against rhyme and for strict quantitative\r\nmeasures, but on quite different lines from those of the craze of\r\nStanyhurst and Harvey. Some of his illustrations of his still rather\r\nunnatural fancy (especially \"Rose-cheeked Laura,\" which is now tolerably\r\nfamiliar in anthologies) are charming, though never so charming as his\r\nrhymed \"Airs.\" The poetry is, indeed, mostly in flashes, and it is not very\r\noften that any song is a complete gem, like the best of the songs from the\r\ndramatists, one or two of which will be given presently for comparison. But\r\nby far the greater number contain and exemplify those numerous\r\ncharacteristics of poetry, as distinguished from verse, which at one time\r\nof literary history seem naturally to occur--seem indeed to be had for the\r\ngathering by any one who chooses--while at another time they are but\r\nsparingly found in the work of men of real genius, and seem altogether to\r\nescape men of talent, accomplishment, and laborious endeavour. Here are a\r\nfew specimens from Peele and others, especially Campion. As it is, an\r\nexceptional amount of the small space possible for such things in this\r\nvolume has been given to them, but there is a great temptation to give\r\nmore. Lyly's lyrical work, however, is fairly well known, and more than one\r\ncollection of \"Songs from the Dramatists\" has popularised others.\r\n\r\n              _AE._ \"Fair and fair, and twice so fair,\r\n                   As fair as any may be;\r\n                   The fairest shepherd on our green,\r\n                   A love for any lady.\r\n\r\n            _Par._ Fair and fair, and twice so fair,\r\n                   As fair as any may be:\r\n                   Thy love is fair for thee alone,\r\n                   And for no other lady.\r\n\r\n              _AE._ My love is fair, my love is gay,\r\n                   As fresh as bin the flowers in May,\r\n                   And of my love my roundelay\r\n                   Concludes with Cupid's curse,\r\n                   They that do change old love for new\r\n                   Pray gods, they change for worse!\r\n\r\n    _Ambo, simul._ They that do change, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n              _AE._ Fair and fair, etc.\r\n\r\n            _Par._ Fair and fair, etc.\r\n\r\n              _AE._ My love can pipe, my love can sing,\r\n                   My love can many a pretty thing,\r\n                   And of his lovely praises ring\r\n                   My merry, merry roundelays.\r\n                   Amen to Cupid's curse,\r\n                   They that do change, etc.\"\r\n\r\n                              PEELE.\r\n\r\n    \"His golden locks time hath to silver turned;\r\n    O time too swift, O swiftness never ceasing!\r\n    His youth 'gainst time and age hath ever spurned,\r\n    But spurned in vain;

And, yet again, a crowd of individual writers, of few of whom is\r\nmuch known, contributed, not in all cases their mites by any means, but\r\noften very respectable sums, to the vast treasury of English poetry. There\r\nis Sir Edward Dyer, the friend of Raleigh and Sidney, who has been\r\nimmortalised by the famous \"My mind to me a kingdom is,\" and who wrote\r\nother pieces not much inferior. There is Raleigh, to whom the glorious\r\npreparatory sonnet to _The Faerie Queene_ would sufficiently justify the\r\nascription of \"a vein most lofty, insolent, and passionate,\" if a very\r\nconsiderable body of verse (independent of the fragmentary _Cynthia_) did\r\nnot justify this many times over, as two brief quotations in addition to\r\nthe sonnet will show:--\r\n\r\n    \"Methought I saw the grave where Laura lay,\r\n      Within that temple where the vestal flame\r\n    Was wont to burn: and, passing by that way\r\n      To see that buried dust of living fame,\r\n    Whose tomb fair Love and fairer Virtue kept,\r\n      All suddenly I saw the Fairy Queen,\r\n    At whose approach the soul of Petrarch wept;\r\n      And from henceforth those graces were not seen,\r\n    For they this Queen attended; in whose stead\r\n      Oblivion laid him down on Laura's hearse.\r\n    Hereat the hardest stones were seen to bleed,\r\n      And groans of buried ghosts the heavens did pierce:\r\n    Where Homer's spright did tremble all for grief,\r\n    And curse the access of that celestial thief.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Three things there be that prosper all apace,\r\n      And flourish while they are asunder far;\r\n    But on a day they meet all in a place,\r\n      And when they meet they one another mar.\r\n\r\n    \"And they be these--the Wood, the Weed, the Wag:\r\n      The Wood is that that makes the gallows tree;\r\n    The Weed is that that strings the hangman's bag;\r\n      The Wag, my pretty knave, betokens thee.\r\n\r\n    \"Now mark, dear boy--while these assemble not,\r\n      Green springs the tree, hemp grows, the Wag is wild;\r\n    But when they meet, it makes the timber rot,\r\n      It frets the halter, and it chokes the child.\r\n\r\n              \"God bless the Child!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Give me my scallop-shell of quiet,\r\n      My staff of faith to walk upon,\r\n    My scrip of joy, immortal diet,\r\n      My bottle of salvation,\r\n    My gown of glory, hope's true gage;\r\n    And thus I'll take my pilgrimage.\r\n\r\n    \"Blood must be my body's balmer;\r\n      No other balm will there be given;\r\n    Whilst my soul, like quiet palmer,\r\n      Travelleth towards the land of heaven;\r\n    Over the silver mountains\r\n    Where spring the nectar fountains:\r\n        There will I kiss\r\n        The bowl of bliss;\r\n    And drink mine everlasting fill\r\n    Upon every milken hill.\r\n    My soul will be a-dry before,\r\n    But after it will thirst no more.\"\r\n\r\nThere is Lord Oxford, Sidney's enemy (which he might be if he chose), and\r\napparently a coxcomb (which is less pardonable), but a charming writer of\r\nverse, as in the following:--\r\n\r\n    \"Come hither, shepherd swain!\r\n      Sir, what do you require?\r\n    I pray thee, shew to me thy name!\r\n      My name is Fond Desire.\r\n\r\n    \"When wert thou born, Desire?\r\n      In pomp and prime of May.\r\n    By whom, sweet boy, wert thou begot?\r\n      By fond Conceit, men say.\r\n\r\n    \"Tell me, who was thy nurse\r\n      Fresh youth, in sugared joy.\r\n    What was thy meat and daily food?\r\n      Sad sighs, with great annoy.\r\n\r\n    \"What hadst thou then to drink?\r\n      Unfeigned lovers' tears.\r\n    What cradle wert thou rocked in?\r\n      In hope devoid of fears.\r\n\r\n    \"What lulled thee then asleep?\r\n      Sweet speech which likes me best.\r\n    Tell me, where is thy dwelling-place?\r\n      In gentle hearts I rest.\r\n\r\n    \"What thing doth please thee most?\r\n      To gaze on beauty still.\r\n    Whom dost thou think to be thy foe?\r\n      Disdain of my good will.\r\n\r\n    \"Doth company displease?\r\n      Yes, surely, many one.\r\n    Where doth desire delight to live?\r\n      He loves to live alone.\r\n\r\n    \"Doth either time or age\r\n      Bring him unto decay?\r\n    No, no! Desire both lives and dies\r\n      A thousand times a day.\r\n\r\n    \"Then, fond Desire, farewell!\r\n      Thou art no mate for me;\r\n    I should be loath, methinks, to dwell\r\n      With such a one as thee.\r\n\r\nThere is, in the less exalted way, the industrious man of all work,\r\nNicholas Breton, whom we shall speak of more at length among the\r\npamphleteers, and John Davies of Hereford, no poet certainly, but a most\r\nindustrious verse-writer in satiric and other forms. Mass of production,\r\nand in some cases personal interest, gives these a certain standing above\r\ntheir fellows. But the crowd of those fellows, about many of whom even the\r\npainful industry of the modern commentator has been able to tell us next to\r\nnothing, is almost miraculous when we remember that printing was still\r\ncarried on under a rigid censorship by a select body of monopolists, and\r\nthat out of London, and in rare cases the university towns, it was\r\nimpossible for a minor poet to get into print at all unless he trusted to\r\nthe contraband presses of the Continent. In dealing with this crowd of\r\nenthusiastic poetical students it is impossible to mention all, and\r\ninvidious to single out some only. The very early and interesting _Posy of\r\nGillyflowers_ of Humphrey Gifford (1580) exhibits the first stage of our\r\nperiod, and might almost have been referred to the period before it; the\r\nsame humpty-dumpty measure of eights and sixes, and the same vestiges of\r\nrather infantine alliteration being apparent in it, though something of the\r\nfire and variety of the new age of poetry appears beside them, notably in\r\nthis most spirited war-song:--\r\n\r\n    (_For Soldiers._)\r\n\r\n    \"Ye buds of Brutus' land, courageous youths now play your parts,[28]\r\n    Unto your tackle stand, abide the brunt with valiant hearts,\r\n    For news is carried to and fro, that we must forth to warfare go:\r\n    Then muster now in every place, and soldiers are pressed forth apace.\r\n    Faint not, spend blood to do your Queen and country good:\r\n    Fair words, good pay, will make men cast all care away.\r\n\r\n    \"The time of war is come, prepare your corslet, spear, and shield:\r\n    Methinks I hear the drum strike doleful marches to the field.\r\n    Tantara, tantara the trumpets sound, which makes our hearts with joy\r\n          abound.\r\n    The roaring guns are heard afar, and everything announceth war.\r\n    Serve God, stand stout; bold courage brings this gear about;\r\n    Fear not, forth run: faint heart fair lady never won.\r\n\r\n    \"Ye curious carpet-knights that spend the time in sport and play,\r\n    Abroad and see new sights, your country's cause calls you away:\r\n    Do not, to make your ladies' game, bring blemish to your worthy name.\r\n    Away to field and win renown, with courage beat your enemies down;\r\n    Stout hearts gain praise, when dastards sail in slander's seas.\r\n    Hap what hap shall, we soon shall die but once for all.\r\n\r\n    \"Alarm! methinks they cry. Be packing mates, begone with speed,\r\n    Our foes are very nigh: shame have that man that shrinks at need.\r\n    Unto it boldly let us stand, God will give right the upper hand.\r\n    Our cause is good we need not doubt: in sign of courage give a shout;\r\n    March forth, be strong, good hap will come ere it be long.\r\n    Shrink not, fight well, for lusty lads must bear the bell.\r\n\r\n    \"All you that will shun evil must dwell in warfare every day.\r\n    The world, the flesh, the devil always do seek our souls' decay.\r\n    Strive with these foes with all your might, so shall you fight a\r\n          worthy fight.\r\n    That conquest dost deserve most praise, whose vice do[th] yield to\r\n          virtue's ways.\r\n    Beat down foul sin, a worthy crown then shall ye win:\r\n    If ye live well, in Heaven with Christ our souls shall dwell.\"\r\n\r\n[28] I print this as in the original, but perhaps the rhythm, which is an\r\nodd one, would be better marked if lines 1 and 2 were divided into sixes\r\nand eights, lines 3 and 4 into eights, and lines 5 and 6 into fours and\r\neights as the rhyme ends.\r\n\r\nOf the same date, or indeed earlier, are the miscellaneous poems of Thomas\r\nHowell, entitled _The Arbour of Amity_, and chiefly of an ethical\r\ncharacter. Less excusable for the uncouthness of his verse is Matthew\r\nGrove, who, writing, or at least publishing, his poems in 1587, should have\r\nlearnt something, but apparently had not. It has to be said in excuse of\r\nhim that his date and indeed existence are shadowy, even among the shadowy\r\nElizabethan bards; his editor, in worse doggerel than his own, frankly\r\nconfessing that he knew nothing about him, not so much as whether he was\r\nalive or dead. But his work, Howell's, and even part of Gifford's, is\r\nchiefly interesting as giving us in the very sharpest contrast the\r\ndifferences of the poetry before and after the melodious bursts of which\r\nSpenser, Sidney, and Watson were the first mouthpieces. Except an utter\r\ndunce (which Grove does not seem to have been by any means) no one who had\r\nbefore him _The Shepherd's Calendar_, or the _Hecatompathia_, or a MS. copy\r\nof _Astrophel and Stella_, could have written as Grove wrote. There are\r\nechoes of this earlier and woodener matter to be found later, but, as a\r\nwhole, the passionate love of beauty, the sense--if only a groping\r\nsense--of form, and the desire to follow, and if possible improve upon the\r\nmodels of melodious verse which the Sidneian school had given, preserved\r\neven poetasters from the lowest depths.\r\n\r\nTo classify the miscellaneous verse of 1590-1600 (for the second decade is\r\nmuch richer than the first) under subjects and styles is a laborious and,\r\nat best, an uncertain business. The semi-mythological love-poem, with a\r\nmore or less tragic ending, had not a few followers; the collection of\r\npoems of various character in praise of a real or imaginary mistress,\r\nsimilar in design to the sonnet collections, but either more miscellaneous\r\nin form or less strung together in one long composition, had even more;\r\nwhile the collection pure and simple, resembling the miscellanies in\r\nabsence of special character, but the work of one, not of many writers, was\r\nalso plentifully represented. Satirical allegory, epigram, and other kinds,\r\nhad numerous examples. But there were two classes of verse which were both\r\nsufficiently interesting in themselves and were cultivated by persons of\r\nsufficient individual repute to deserve separate and detailed mention.\r\nThese were the historical poem or history--a kind of companion production\r\nto the chronicle play or chronicle, and a very popular one--which, besides\r\nthe names of Warner, Daniel, and Drayton, counted not a few minor adherents\r\namong Elizabethan bards. Such were the already-mentioned Giles Fletcher;\r\nsuch Fitz-Geoffrey in a remarkable poem on Drake, and Gervase Markham in a\r\nnot less noteworthy piece on the last fight of _The Revenge_; such numerous\r\nothers, some of whom are hardly remembered, and perhaps hardly deserve to\r\nbe. The other, and as a class the more interesting, though nothing actually\r\nproduced by its practitioners may be quite equal to the best work of\r\nDrayton and Daniel, was the beginning of English satire. This beginning is\r\ninteresting not merely because of the apparent coincidence of instinct\r\nwhich made four or five writers of great talent simultaneously hit on the\r\nstyle, so that it is to this day difficult to award exactly the palm of\r\npriority, but also because the result of their studies, in some peculiar\r\nand at first sight rather inexplicable ways, is some of the most\r\ncharacteristic, if very far from being some of the best, work of the whole\r\npoetical period with which we are now busied. In passing, moreover, from\r\nthe group of miscellaneous poets to these two schools, if we lose not a\r\nlittle of the harmony and lyrical sweetness which characterise the best\r\nwork of the Elizabethan singer proper, we gain greatly in bulk and dignity\r\nof work and in intrinsic value. Of at least one of the poets mentioned in\r\nthe last paragraph his modern editor--a most enthusiastic and tolerant\r\ngodfather of waifs and strays of literature--confesses that he really does\r\nnot quite know why he should be reprinted, except that the original is\r\nunique, and that almost every scrap of literature in this period is of some\r\nvalue, if only for lexicographic purposes. No one would dream of speaking\r\nthus of Drayton or of Daniel, of Lodge, Hall, Donne, or Marston; while even\r\nWarner, the weakest of the names to which we shall proceed to give separate\r\nnotice, can be praised without too much allowance. In the latter case,\r\nmoreover, if not in the first (for the history-poem, until it was taken up\r\nin a very different spirit at the beginning of this century, never was a\r\nsuccess in England), the matter now to be reviewed, after being in its own\r\nkind neglected for a couple of generations, served as forerunner, if not\r\nexactly as model, to the magnificent satiric work of Dryden, and through\r\nhis to that of Pope, Young, Churchill, Cowper, and the rest of the more\r\naccomplished English satirists. The acorn of such an oak cannot be without\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe example of _The Mirror for Magistrates_ is perhaps sufficient to\r\naccount for the determination of a certain number of Elizabethan poets\r\ntowards English history; especially if we add the stimulating effect of\r\nHolinshed's _Chronicle_, which was published in 1580. The first of the\r\nso-called historians, William Warner, belongs in point of poetical style to\r\nthe pre-Spenserian period, and like its other exponents employs the\r\nfourteener; while, unlike some of them, he seems quite free from any\r\nItalian influence in phraseology or poetical manner. Nevertheless _Albion's\r\nEngland_ is, not merely in bulk but in merit, far ahead of the average work\r\nof our first period, and quite incommensurable with such verse as that of\r\nGrove. It appeared by instalments (1586-1606-1612). Of its author, William\r\nWarner, the old phrase has to be repeated, that next to nothing is known of\r\nhim. He was an Oxfordshire man by birth, and an Oxford man by education; he\r\nhad something to do with Cary, Lord Hunsdon, became an Attorney of the\r\nCommon Pleas, and died at Amwell suddenly in his bed in 1609, being, as it\r\nis guessed rather than known, fifty years old or thereabouts. _Albion's\r\nEngland_ was seized as contraband, by orders of the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury--a proceeding for which no one has been able to account (the\r\nsuggestion that parts of it are indelicate is, considering the manners of\r\nthe time, quite ludicrous), and which may perhaps have been due to some\r\ntechnical informality. It is thought that he is the author of a translation\r\nof Plautus's _Menaechmi_; he certainly produced in 1585? a prose story, or\r\nrather collection of stories, entitled _Syrinx_, which, however, is\r\nscarcely worth reading. _Albion's England_ is in no danger of incurring\r\nthat sentence. In the most easily accessible edition, that of Chalmers's\r\n\"Poets,\" it is spoilt by having the fourteeners divided into eights and\r\nsixes, and it should if possible be read in the original arrangement.\r\nConsidering how few persons have written about it, an odd collection of\r\ncritical slips might be made. Philips, Milton's nephew, in this case it may\r\nbe hoped, not relying on his uncle, calls Warner a \"good plain writer of\r\nmoral rules and precepts\": the fact being that though he sometimes\r\nmoralises he is in the main a story-teller, and much more bent on narrative\r\nthan on teaching. Meres calls him \"a refiner of the English tongue,\" and\r\nattributes to him \"rare ornaments and resplendent habiliments of the pen\":\r\nthe truth being that he is (as Philips so far correctly says) a singularly\r\nplain, straightforward, and homely writer. Others say that he wrote in\r\n\"Alexandrines\"--a blunder, and a serious one, which has often been repeated\r\nup to the present day in reference to other writers of the seven-foot\r\nverse. He brings in, according to the taste and knowledge of his time, all\r\nthe fabulous accounts of the origins of Britain, and diversifies them with\r\nmany romantic and pastoral histories, classical tales, and sometimes mere\r\n_Fabliaux_, down to his own time. The chief of the episodes, the story of\r\nArgentile and Curan, has often, and not undeservedly, met with high praise,\r\nand sometimes in his declamatory parts Warner achieves a really great\r\nsuccess. Probably, however, what commended his poem most to the taste of\r\nthe day was its promiscuous admixture of things grave and gay--a mixture\r\nwhich was always much to the taste of Elizabeth's men, and the popularity\r\nof which produced and fostered many things, from the matchless tragi-comedy\r\nof _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_ to the singularly formless pamphlets of which we\r\nshall speak hereafter. The main interest of Warner is his insensibility to\r\nthe new influences which Spenser and Sidney directed, and which are found\r\nproducing their full effect on Daniel and Drayton. There were those in his\r\nown day who compared him to Homer: one of the most remarkable instances of\r\nthoroughly unlucky critical extravagance to be found in literary history,\r\nas the following very fair average specimen will show:--\r\n\r\n    \"Henry (as if by miracle preserved by foreigns long,\r\n    From hence-meant treasons) did arrive to right his natives' wrong:\r\n    And chiefly to Lord Stanley, and some other succours, as\r\n    Did wish and work for better days, the rival welcome was.\r\n    Now Richard heard that Richmond was assisted and ashore,\r\n    And like unkennel'd Cerberus, the crooked tyrant swore,\r\n    And all complexions act at once confusedly in him:\r\n    He studieth, striketh, threats, entreats, and looketh mildly grim,\r\n    Mistrustfully he trusteth, and he dreadingly did dare,\r\n    And forty passions in a trice, in him consort and square.\r\n    But when, by his consented force, his foes increased more,\r\n    He hastened battle, finding his co-rival apt therefore.\r\n    When Richmond, orderly in all, had battled his aid,\r\n    Inringed by his complices, their cheerful leader said:\r\n    'Now is the time and place (sweet friends) and we the persons be\r\n    That must give England breath, or else unbreathe for her must we.\r\n    No tyranny is fabled, and no tyrant was in deed\r\n    Worse than our foe, whose works will act my words, if well he speed:\r\n    For ill to ills superlative are easily enticed,\r\n    But entertains amendment as the Gergesites did Christ.\r\n    Be valiant then, he biddeth so that would not be outbid,\r\n    For courage yet shall honour him though base, that better did.\r\n    I am right heir Lancastrian, he, in York's destroyed right\r\n    Usurpeth: but through either ours, for neither claim I fight,\r\n    But for our country's long-lack'd weal, for England's peace I war:\r\n    Wherein He speed us! unto Whom I all events refer.'\r\n    Meanwhile had furious Richard set his armies in array,\r\n    And then, with looks even like himself, this or the like did say:\r\n    'Why, lads, shall yonder Welshman with his stragglers overmatch?\r\n    Disdain ye not such rivals, and defer ye their dispatch?\r\n    Shall Tudor from Plantagenet, the crown by cracking snatch?\r\n    Know Richard's very thoughts' (he touch'd the diadem he wore)\r\n    'Be metal of this metal: then believe I love it more\r\n    Than that for other law than life, to supersede my claim,\r\n    And lesser must not be his plea that counterpleads the same.'\r\n    The weapons overtook his words, and blows they bravely change,\r\n    When, like a lion thirsting blood, did moody Richard range,\r\n    And made large slaughters where he went, till Richmond he espied,\r\n    Whom singling, after doubtful swords, the valorous tyrant died.\"\r\n\r\nOf the sonnet compositions of Daniel and Drayton something has been said\r\nalready. But Daniel's sonnets are a small and Drayton's an infinitesimal\r\npart of the work of the two poets respectively. Samuel Daniel was a\r\nSomersetshire man, born near Taunton in 1562. He is said to have been the\r\nson of a music master, but was educated at Oxford, made powerful friends,\r\nand died an independent person at Beckington, in the county of his birth,\r\nin the year 1619. He was introduced early to good society and patronage,\r\nbecame tutor to Lady Anne Clifford, a great heiress of the North, was\r\nfavoured by the Earl of Southampton, and became a member of the Pembroke or\r\n_Arcadia_ coterie. His friends or his merits obtained for him, it is said,\r\nthe Mastership of the Revels, the posts of Gentleman Extraordinary to James\r\nI., and Groom of the Privy Chamber to Anne of Denmark. His literary\r\nproduction besides _Delia_ was considerable. With the first authorised\r\nedition of that collection he published _The Complaint of Rosamond_; a\r\nhistorical poem of great grace and elegance though a little wanting in\r\nstrength. In 1594 came his interesting Senecan tragedy of _Cleopatra_; in\r\n1595 the first part of his chief work, _The History of the Civil Wars_, and\r\nin 1601 a collected folio of \"Works.\" Then he rested, at any rate from\r\npublication, till 1605, when he produced _Philotas_, another Senecan\r\ntragedy in verse. In prose he wrote the admirable _Defence of Rhyme_, which\r\nfinally smashed the fancy for classical metres dear even to such a man as\r\nCampion. _Hymen's Triumph_, a masque of great beauty, was not printed till\r\nfour years before his death. He also wrote a History of England as well as\r\nminor works. The poetical value of Daniel may almost be summed up in two\r\nwords--sweetness and dignity. He is decidedly wanting in strength, and,\r\ndespite _Delia_, can hardly be said to have had a spark of passion. Even in\r\nhis own day it was doubted whether he had not overweighted himself with his\r\nchoice of historical subjects, though the epithet of \"well-languaged,\"\r\ngiven to him at the time, evinces a real comprehension of one of his best\r\nclaims to attention. No writer of the period has such a command of pure\r\nEnglish, unadulterated by xenomania and unweakened by purism, as Daniel.\r\nWhatever unfavourable things have been said of him from time to time have\r\nbeen chiefly based on the fact that his chaste and correct style lacks the\r\nfiery quaintness, the irregular and audacious attraction of his\r\ncontemporaries. Nor was he less a master of versification than of\r\nvocabulary. His _Defence of Rhyme_ shows that he possessed the theory: all\r\nhis poetical works show that he was a master of the practice. He rarely\r\nattempted and probably would not have excelled in the lighter lyrical\r\nmeasures. But in the grave music of the various elaborate stanzas in which\r\nthe Elizabethan poets delighted, and of which the Spenserian, though the\r\ncrown and flower, is only the most perfect, he was a great proficient, and\r\nhis couplets and blank verse are not inferior. Some of his single lines\r\nhave already been quoted, and many more might be excerpted from his work of\r\nthe best Elizabethan brand in the quieter kind. Quiet, indeed, is the\r\novermastering characteristic of Daniel. It was this no doubt which made him\r\nprefer the stately style of his Senecan tragedies, and the hardly more\r\ndisturbed structure of pastoral comedies and tragi-comedies, like the\r\n_Queen's Arcadia_ and _Hymen's Triumph_, to the boisterous revels of the\r\nstage proper in his time. He had something of the schoolmaster in his\r\nnature as well as in his history. Nothing is more agreeable to him than to\r\nmoralise; not indeed in any dull or crabbed manner, but in a mellifluous\r\nand at the same time weighty fashion, of which very few other poets have\r\nthe secret. It is perhaps by his scrupulous propriety, by his anxious\r\ndecency (to use the word not in its modern and restricted sense, but in its\r\nproper meaning of the generally becoming), that Daniel brought upon himself\r\nthe rather hard saying that he had a manner \"better suiting prose.\"\r\n\r\nThe sentence will scarcely be echoed by any one who has his best things\r\nbefore him, however much a reader of some of the duller parts of the\r\nhistorical poems proper may feel inclined to echo it. Of his sonnets one\r\nhas been given. The splendid Epistle to the Countess of Cumberland is not\r\nsurpassed as ethical poetry by anything of the period, and often as it has\r\nbeen quoted, it must be given again, for it is not and never can be too\r\nwell known:--\r\n\r\n    \"He that of such a height hath built his mind,\r\n    And reared the dwelling of his thoughts so strong,\r\n    As neither fear nor hope can shake the frame\r\n    Of his resolved powers; nor all the wind\r\n    Of vanity or malice pierce to wrong\r\n    His settled peace, or to disturb the same:\r\n    What a fair seat hath he, from whence he may\r\n    The boundless wastes and wealds of man survey!\r\n\r\n    \"And with how free an eye doth he look down\r\n    Upon these lower regions of turmoil!\r\n    Where all the storms of passion mainly beat\r\n    On flesh and blood: where honour, power, renown,\r\n    Are only gay afflictions, golden toil;\r\n    Where greatness stands upon as feeble feet\r\n    As frailty doth; and only great doth seem\r\n    To little minds, who do it so esteem.\r\n\r\n    \"He looks upon the mightiest monarch's wars\r\n    But only as on stately robberies;\r\n    Where evermore the fortune that prevails\r\n    Must be the right: the ill-succeeding mars\r\n    The fairest and the best fac'd enterprise.\r\n    Great pirate Pompey lesser pirates quails:\r\n    Justice, he sees (as if seduced) still\r\n    Conspires with power, whose cause must not be ill.\r\n\r\n    \"He sees the face of right t'appear as manifold\r\n    As are the passions of uncertain man;\r\n    Who puts it in all colours, all attires,\r\n    To serve his ends, and make his courses hold.\r\n    He sees, that let deceit work what it can,\r\n    Plot and contrive base ways to high desires,\r\n    That the all-guiding Providence doth yet\r\n    All disappoint, and mocks the smoke of wit.\r\n\r\n    \"Nor is he mov'd with all the thunder cracks\r\n    Of tyrants' threats, or with the surly brow\r\n    Of Power, that proudly sits on others' crimes;\r\n    Charg'd with more crying sins than those he checks.\r\n    The storms of sad confusion, that may grow\r\n    Up in the present for the coming times\r\n    Appal not him; that hath no side at all,\r\n    But of himself, and knows the worst can fall.\r\n\r\n    \"Although his heart (so near allied to Earth)\r\n    Cannot but pity the perplexed state\r\n    Of troublous and distress'd Mortality,\r\n    That thus make way unto the ugly birth\r\n    Of their own sorrows, and do still beget\r\n    Affliction upon imbecility:\r\n    Yet seeing thus the course of things must run,\r\n    He looks thereon not strange, but as fore-done.\r\n\r\n    \"And whilst distraught ambition compasses,\r\n    And is encompass'd; whilst as craft deceives,\r\n    And is deceiv'd: whilst man doth ransack man\r\n    And builds on blood, and rises by distress;\r\n    And th' inheritance of desolation leaves\r\n    To great-expecting hopes: he looks thereon,\r\n    As from the shore of peace, with unwet eye,\r\n    And bears no venture in impiety.\"\r\n\r\nIn sharp contrast with this the passage from _Hymen's Triumph_,\r\n\r\n    \"Ah, I remember well, and how can I,\"\r\n\r\nshows the sweetness without namby-pambyness which Daniel had at constant\r\ncommand. Something of the same contrast may be found between the whole of\r\n_Hymen's Triumph_ and the _Queen's Arcadia_ on the one side, and\r\n_Cleopatra_ and _Philotas_ on the other. All are written in mixed blank and\r\nrhymed verse, much interlaced and \"enjambed.\" The best of the historical\r\npoems is, by common consent, _Rosamond_, which is instinct with a most\r\nremarkable pathos, nor are fine passages by any means to seek in the\r\ngreater length and less poetical subject of _The Civil Wars of York and\r\nLancaster_. The fault of this is that the too conscientious historian is\r\nconstantly versifying what must be called mere expletive matter. This must\r\nalways make any one who speaks with critical impartiality admit that much\r\nof Daniel is hard reading; but the soft places (to use the adjective in no\r\nill sense) are frequent enough, and when the reader comes to them he must\r\nhave little appreciation of poetry if he does not rejoice in the foliage\r\nand the streams of the poetical oasis which has rewarded him after his\r\npilgrimage across a rather arid wilderness.\r\n\r\nMichael Drayton was much better fitted for the arduous, and perhaps not\r\nwholly legitimate, business of historical poetry than Daniel. If his genius\r\nwas somewhat less fine, it was infinitely better thewed and sinewed. His\r\nability, indeed, to force any subject which he chose to treat into poetry\r\nis amazing, and can hardly be paralleled elsewhere except in a poet who was\r\nborn but just before Drayton's death, John Dryden. He was pretty certainly\r\na gentleman by birth, though not of any great possessions, and is said to\r\nhave been born at Hartshill, in Warwickshire, in the year 1563. He is also\r\nsaid, but not known, to have been a member of the University of Oxford, and\r\nappears to have been fairly provided with patrons, in the family of some\r\none of whom he served as page, though he never received any great or\r\npermanent preferment.[29] On the other hand, he was not a successful\r\ndramatist (the only literary employment of the time that brought in much\r\nmoney), and friend as he was of nearly all the men of letters of the time,\r\nit is expressly stated in one of the few personal notices we have of him,\r\nthat he could not \"swagger in a tavern or domineer in a hothouse\" [house of\r\nill-fame]--that is to say, that the hail-fellow well-met Bohemianism of the\r\ntime, which had led Marlowe and many of his group to evil ends, and which\r\nwas continued in a less outrageous form under the patronage of Ben Jonson\r\ntill far into the next age, had no charms for him. Yet he must have lived\r\nsomehow and to a good age, for he did not die till the 23d December 1631.\r\nHe was buried in Westminster Abbey, a fact which drew from Goldsmith, in\r\n_The Citizen of the World_, a gibe showing only the lamentable ignorance of\r\nthe best period of English poetry, in which Goldsmith was not indeed\r\nalone, but in which he was perhaps pre-eminent among contemporaries eminent\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\n[29] Drayton has been thoroughly treated by Professor Oliver Elton in\r\n_Michael Drayton_ (London, 1905), enlarged from a monograph for the Spenser\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nDrayton's long life was as industrious as it was long. He began in 1591\r\nwith a volume of sacred verse, the _Harmony of the Church_, which, for some\r\nreason not merely undiscovered but unguessed, displeased the censors, and\r\nwas never reprinted with his other works until recently. Two years later\r\nappeared _Idea, The Shepherd's Garland_--a collection of eclogues not to be\r\nconfounded with the more famous collection of sonnets in praise of the same\r\nreal or fancied mistress which appeared later. In the first of these\r\nDrayton called himself \"Rowland,\" or \"Roland,\" a fact on which some rather\r\nrickety structures of guesswork have been built as to allusions to him in\r\nSpenser. His next work was _Mortimeriados_, afterwards refashioned and\r\ncompleted under the title of _The Barons' Wars_, and this was followed in\r\n1597 by one of his best works, _England's Heroical Epistles_. _The Owl_,\r\nsome _Legends_, and other poems succeeded; and in 1605 he began to collect\r\nhis Works, which were frequently reprinted. The mighty poem of the\r\n_Polyolbion_ was the fruit of his later years, and, in strictness, belongs\r\nto the period of a later chapter; but Drayton's muse is eminently one and\r\nindivisible, and, notwithstanding the fruits of pretty continual study\r\nwhich his verses show, they belong, in the order of thought, to the middle\r\nand later Elizabethan period rather than to the Jacobean.\r\n\r\nFew poets of anything like Drayton's volume (of which some idea may be\r\nformed by saying that his works, in the not quite complete form in which\r\nthey appear in Chalmers, fill five hundred of the bulky pages of that work,\r\neach page frequently containing a hundred and twenty-eight lines) show such\r\nuniform mixture of imagination and vigour. In the very highest and rarest\r\ngraces of poetry he is, indeed, by common consent wanting, unless one of\r\nthese graces in the uncommon kind of the war-song be allowed, as perhaps it\r\nmay be, to the famous and inimitable though often imitated _Ballad of\r\nAgincourt_, \"To the brave Cambro-Britons and their Harp,\" not to be\r\nconfounded with the narrative \"Battle of Agincourt,\" which is of a less\r\nrare merit. The Agincourt ballad,\r\n\r\n    \"Fair stood the wind for France,\"\r\n\r\nis quite at the head of its own class of verse in England--Campbell's two\r\nmasterpieces, and Lord Tennyson's still more direct imitation in the \"Six\r\nHundred,\" falling, the first somewhat, and the last considerably, short of\r\nit. The sweep of the metre, the martial glow of the sentiment, and the\r\nskill with which the names are wrought into the verse, are altogether\r\nbeyond praise. Drayton never, unless the enigmatical sonnet to Idea (see\r\n_ante_) be really his, rose to such concentration of matter and such\r\nelaborate yet unforced perfection of manner as here, yet his great\r\nqualities are perceptible all over his work. The enormous _Polyolbion_,\r\nwritten in a metre the least suitable to continuous verse of any in\r\nEnglish--the Alexandrine--crammed with matter rebel to poetry, and obliging\r\nthe author to find his chief poetical attraction rather in superadded\r\nornament, in elaborately patched-on passages, than in the actual and\r\nnatural evolution of his theme, is still a very great work in another than\r\nthe mechanical sense. Here is a fairly representative passage:--\r\n\r\n    \"The haughty Cambrian hills enamoured of their praise,\r\n    (As they who only sought ambitiously to raise\r\n    The blood of God-like Brute) their heads do proudly bear:\r\n    And having crown'd themselves sole regents of the air\r\n    (Another war with Heaven as though they meant to make)\r\n    Did seem in great disdain the bold affront to take,\r\n    That any petty hill upon the English side,\r\n    Should dare, not (with a crouch) to veil unto their pride.\r\n    When Wrekin, as a hill his proper worth that knew,\r\n    And understood from whence their insolency grew,\r\n    For all that they appear'd so terrible in sight,\r\n    Yet would not once forego a jot that was his right,\r\n    And when they star'd on him, to them the like he gave,\r\n    And answer'd glance for glance, and brave for brave:\r\n    That, when some other hills which English dwellers were,\r\n    The lusty Wrekin saw himself so well to bear\r\n    Against the Cambrian part, respectless of their power;\r\n    His eminent disgrace expecting every hour\r\n    Those flatterers that before (with many cheerful look)\r\n    Had grac'd his goodly sight, him utterly forsook,\r\n    And muffled them in clouds, like mourners veiled in black,\r\n    Which of their utmost hope attend the ruinous wrack:\r\n    That those delicious nymphs, fair Team and Rodon clear\r\n    (Two brooks of him belov'd, and two that held him dear;\r\n    He, having none but them, they having none but he\r\n    Which to their mutual joy might either's object be)\r\n    Within their secret breast conceived sundry fears,\r\n    And as they mix'd their streams, for him so mix'd their tears.\r\n    Whom, in their coming down, when plainly he discerns,\r\n    For them his nobler heart in his strong bosom yearns:\r\n    But, constantly resolv'd, that dearer if they were\r\n    The Britons should not yet all from the English bear;\r\n    'Therefore,' quoth he, 'brave flood, tho' forth by Cambria brought,\r\n    Yet as fair England's friend, or mine thou would'st be thought\r\n    (O Severn) let thine ear my just defence partake.'\"\r\n\r\nHappy phrases abound, and, moreover, every now and then there are set\r\npieces, as they may be called, of fanciful description which are full of\r\nbeauty; for Drayton (a not very usual thing in a man of such unflagging\r\nindustry, and even excellence of work) was full of fancy. The fairy poem of\r\n_Nymphidia_ is one of the most graceful trifles in the language, possessing\r\na dancing movement and a felicitous choice of imagery and language which\r\ntriumphantly avoid the trivial on the one hand, and the obviously burlesque\r\non the other. The singular satirical or quasi-satirical poems of _The\r\nMooncalf_, _The Owl_, and _The Man in the Moon_, show a faculty of comic\r\ntreatment less graceful indeed, but scarcely inferior, and the lyrics\r\ncalled _Odes_ (of which the _Ballad of Agincourt_ is sometimes classed as\r\none) exhibit a command of lyric metre hardly inferior to the command\r\ndisplayed in that masterpiece. In fact, if ever there was a poet who could\r\nwrite, and write, perhaps beautifully, certainly well, about any\r\nconceivable broomstick in almost any conceivable manner, that poet was\r\nDrayton. His historical poems, which are inferior in bulk only to the huge\r\n_Polyolbion_, contain a great deal of most admirable work. They consist of\r\nthree divisions--_The Barons' Wars_ in eight-lined stanzas, the _Heroic\r\nEpistles_ (suggested, of course, by Ovid, though anything but Ovidian) in\r\nheroic couplets, _The Miseries of Queen Margaret_ in the same stanza as\r\n_The Barons' Wars_, and _Four Legends_ in stanzas of various form and\r\nrange. That this mass of work should possess, or should, indeed, admit of\r\nthe charms of poetry which distinguish _The Faerie Queene_ would be\r\nimpossible, even if Drayton had been Spenser, which he was far from being.\r\nBut to speak of his \"dull creeping narrative,\" to accuse him of the\r\n\"coarsest vulgarities,\" of being \"flat and prosaic,\" and so on, as was done\r\nby eighteenth-century critics, is absolutely uncritical, unless it be very\r\nmuch limited. _The Barons' Wars_ is somewhat dull, the author being too\r\ncareful to give a minute history of a not particularly interesting subject,\r\nand neglecting to take the only possible means of making it interesting by\r\nbringing out strongly the characters of heroes and heroines, and so\r\ninfusing a dramatic interest. But this absence of character is a constant\r\ndrawback to the historical poems of the time. And even here we find many\r\npassages where the drawback of the stanza for narrative is most skilfully\r\navoided, and where the vigour of the single lines and phrases is\r\nunquestionable on any sound estimate.\r\n\r\nStill the stanza, though Drayton himself defends it (it should be mentioned\r\nthat his prose prefaces are excellent, and constitute another link between\r\nhim and Dryden), is something of a clog; and the same thing is felt in _The\r\nMiseries of Queen Margaret_ and the _Legends_, where, however, it is again\r\nnot difficult to pick out beauties. The _Heroical Epistles_ can be praised\r\nwith less allowance. Their shorter compass, their more manageable metre\r\n(for Drayton was a considerable master of the earlier form of couplet), and\r\nthe fact that a personal interest is infused in each, give them a great\r\nadvantage; and, as always, passages of great merit are not infrequent.\r\nFinally, Drayton must have the praise (surely not quite irrelevant) of a\r\nmost ardent and lofty spirit of patriotism. Never was there a better\r\nEnglishman, and as his love of his country spirited him up to the brilliant\r\neffort of the _Ballad of Agincourt_, so it sustained him through the\r\n\"strange herculean task\" of the _Polyolbion_, and often put light and life\r\ninto the otherwise lifeless mass of the historic poems. Yet I have myself\r\nno doubt that these historic poems were a mistake, and that their\r\ncomposition, though prompted by a most creditable motive, the burning\r\nattachment to England which won the fight with Spain, and laid the\r\nfoundation of the English empire, was not altogether, perhaps was not by\r\nany means, according to knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe almost invariable, and I fear it must be said, almost invariably idle\r\ncontroversy about priority in literary styles has been stimulated, in the\r\ncase of English satire, by a boast of Joseph Hall's made in his own\r\n_Virgidemiarum_--\r\n\r\n                    \"Follow me who list,\r\n    And be the _second_ English satirist.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been pleaded in Hall's favour that although the date of publication\r\nof his _Satires_ is known, the date of their composition is not known. It\r\nis not even necessary to resort to this kind of special pleading; for\r\nnothing can be more evident than that the bravado is not very serious. On\r\nthe literal supposition, however, and if we are to suppose that publication\r\nimmediately followed composition, Hall was anticipated by more than one or\r\ntwo predecessors, in the production of work not only specifically satirical\r\nbut actually called satire, and by two at least in the adoption of the\r\nheroic couplet form which has ever since been consecrated to the subject.\r\nSatirical poetry, of a kind, is of course nearly if not quite as old as the\r\nlanguage, and in the hands of Skelton it had assumed various forms. But the\r\nsatire proper--the following of the great Roman examples of Horace,\r\nJuvenal, and Persius in general lashing of vice and folly--can hardly trace\r\nitself further back in England than George Gascoigne's _Steel Glass_, which\r\npreceded Hall's _Virgidemiarum_ by twenty years, and is interesting not\r\nonly for itself but as being ushered in by the earliest known verses of\r\nWalter Raleigh. It is written in blank verse, and is a rather rambling\r\ncommentary on the text _vanitas vanitatum_, but it expressly calls itself a\r\nsatire and answers sufficiently well to the description. More immediate\r\nand nearer examples were to be found in the Satires of Donne and Lodge. The\r\nfirst named were indeed, like the other poetical works of their\r\nmarvellously gifted writer, not published till many years after; but\r\nuniversal tradition ascribes the whole of Donne's profane poems to his\r\nearly youth, and one document exists which distinctly dates \"John Donne,\r\nhis Satires,\" as early as 1593. We shall therefore deal with them, as with\r\nthe other closely connected work of their author, here and in this chapter.\r\nBut there has to be mentioned first the feebler but chronologically more\r\ncertain work of Thomas Lodge, _A Fig for Momus_, which fulfils both the\r\nrequirements of known date and of composition in couplets. It appeared in\r\n1595, two years before Hall, and is of the latest and weakest of Lodge's\r\nverse work. It was written or at least produced when he was just abandoning\r\nhis literary and adventurous career and settling down as a quiet physician\r\nwith no more wild oats to sow, except, perhaps, some participation in\r\npopish conspiracy. The style did not lend itself to the display of any of\r\nLodge's strongest gifts--romantic fancy, tenderness and sweetness of\r\nfeeling, or elaborate embroidery of precious language. He follows Horace\r\npretty closely and with no particular vigour. Nor does the book appear to\r\nhave attracted much attention, so that it is just possible that Hall may\r\nnot have heard of it. If, however, he had not, it is certainly a curious\r\ncoincidence that he, with Donne and Lodge, should all have hit on the\r\ncouplet as their form, obvious as its advantages are when it is once tried.\r\nFor the rhyme points the satirical hits, while the comparatively brief\r\nspace of each distich prevents that air of wandering which naturally\r\naccompanies satire in longer stanzas. At any rate after the work (in so\r\nmany ways remarkable) of Donne, Hall, and Marston, there could hardly be\r\nany more doubt about the matter, though part of the method which these\r\nwriters, especially Donne and Marston, took to give individuality and\r\n\"bite\" to their work was as faulty as it now seems to us peculiar.\r\n\r\nBen Jonson, the least gushing of critics to his contemporaries, said of\r\nJohn Donne that he was \"the first poet of the world in some things,\" and I\r\nown that without going through the long catalogue of singularly\r\ncontradictory criticisms which have been passed on Donne, I feel disposed\r\nto fall back on and adopt this earliest, simplest, and highest encomium.\r\nPossibly Ben might not have meant the same things that I mean, but that\r\ndoes not matter. It is sufficient for me that in one special point of the\r\npoetic charm--the faculty of suddenly transfiguring common things by a\r\nflood of light, and opening up strange visions to the capable\r\nimagination--Donne is surpassed by no poet of any language, and equalled by\r\nfew. That he has obvious and great defects, that he is wholly and in all\r\nprobability deliberately careless of formal smoothness, that he adopted the\r\nfancy of his time for quaint and recondite expression with an almost\r\nperverse vigour, and set the example of the topsy-turvified conceits which\r\ncame to a climax in Crashaw and Cleveland, that he is almost impudently\r\nlicentious in thought and imagery at times, that he alternates the highest\r\npoetry with the lowest doggerel, the noblest thought with the most trivial\r\ncrotchet--all this is true, and all this must be allowed for; but it only\r\nchequers, it does not obliterate, the record of his poetic gifts and\r\ngraces. He is, moreover, one of the most historically important of poets,\r\nalthough by a strange chance there is no known edition of his poems earlier\r\nthan 1633, some partial and privately printed issues having disappeared\r\nwholly if they ever existed. His influence was second to the influence of\r\nno poet of his generation, and completely overshadowed all others, towards\r\nhis own latter days and the decades immediately following his death, except\r\nthat of Jonson. Thomas Carew's famous description of him as\r\n\r\n    \"A king who ruled as he thought fit\r\n    The universal monarchy of wit,\"\r\n\r\nexpresses the general opinion of the time; and even after the revolt headed\r\nby Waller had dethroned him from the position, Dryden, his successor in the\r\nsame monarchy, while declining to allow him the praise of \"the best poet\"\r\n(that is, the most exact follower of the rules and system of versifying\r\nwhich Dryden himself preferred), allowed him to be \"the greatest wit of the\r\nnation.\"\r\n\r\nHis life concerns us little, and its events are not disputed, or rather, in\r\nthe earlier part, are still rather obscure. Born in 1573, educated at both\r\nuniversities and at Lincoln's Inn, a traveller, a man of pleasure, a\r\nlaw-student, a soldier, and probably for a time a member of the Roman\r\nChurch, he seems just before reaching middle life to have experienced some\r\nreligious change, took orders, became a famous preacher, was made Dean of\r\nSt. Paul's, and died in 1631.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that tradition and probability point to the composition of\r\nmost, and that all but certain documentary evidence points to the\r\ncomposition of some, of his poems in the earlier part of his life. Unless\r\nthe date of the Harleian MS. is a forgery, some of his satires were written\r\nin or before 1593, when he was but twenty years old. The boiling passion,\r\nwithout a thought of satiety, which marks many of his elegies would also\r\nincline us to assign them to youth, and though some of his epistles, and\r\nmany of his miscellaneous poems, are penetrated with a quieter and more\r\nreflective spirit, the richness of fancy in them, as well as the amatory\r\ncharacter of many, perhaps the majority, favour a similar attribution. All\r\nalike display Donne's peculiar poetical quality--the fiery imagination\r\nshining in dark places, the magical illumination of obscure and shadowy\r\nthoughts with the lightning of fancy. In one remarkable respect Donne has a\r\npeculiar cast of thought as well as of manner, displaying that mixture of\r\nvoluptuous and melancholy meditation, that swift transition of thought from\r\nthe marriage sheet to the shroud, which is characteristic of French\r\nRenaissance poets, but less fully, until he set the example, of English.\r\nThe best known and most exquisite of his fanciful flights, the idea of the\r\ndiscovery of\r\n\r\n    \"A bracelet of bright hair about the bone\"\r\n\r\nof his own long interred skeleton: the wish--\r\n\r\n    \"I long to talk with some old lover's ghost\r\n    Who died before the god of love was born,\"\r\n\r\nand others, show this peculiarity. And it recurs in the most unexpected\r\nplaces, as, for the matter of that, does his strong satirical faculty. In\r\nsome of his poems, as the _Anatomy of the World_, occasioned by the death\r\nof Mrs. Elizabeth Drury, this melancholy imagery mixed with touches (only\r\ntouches here) of the passion which had distinguished the author earlier\r\n(for the _Anatomy_ is not an early work), and with religious and\r\nphilosophical meditation, makes the strangest amalgam--shot through,\r\nhowever, as always, with the golden veins of Donne's incomparable poetry.\r\nExpressions so strong as this last may seem in want of justification. And\r\nthe three following pieces, the \"Dream,\" a fragment of satire, and an\r\nextract from the _Anatomy_, may or may not, according to taste, supply\r\nit:--\r\n\r\n    \"Dear love, for nothing less than thee\r\n    Would I have broke this happy dream.\r\n          It was a theme\r\n    For reason, much too strong for fantasy:\r\n    Therefore thou wak'dst me wisely; yet\r\n    My dream thou brok'st not, but continued'st it:\r\n    Thou art so true, that thoughts of thee suffice\r\n    To make dreams true, and fables histories;\r\n    Enter these arms, for since thou thought'st it best\r\n    Not to dream all my dream, let's act the rest.\r\n\r\n    \"As lightning or a taper's light\r\n    Thine eyes, and not thy noise, wak'd me;\r\n          Yet I thought thee\r\n    (For thou lov'st truth) an angel at first sight,\r\n    But when I saw thou saw'st my heart\r\n    And knew'st my thoughts beyond an angel's art,\r\n    When thou knew'st what I dreamt, then thou knew'st when\r\n    Excess of joy would wake me, and cam'st then;\r\n    _I must confess, it could not choose but be_\r\n    _Profane to think thee anything but thee._\r\n\r\n    \"Coming and staying show'd thee thee,\r\n    But rising makes me doubt that now\r\n          Thou art not thou.\r\n    That love is weak where fears are strong as he;\r\n    'Tis not all spirit, pure and brave,\r\n    If mixture it of fear, shame, honour, have.\r\n    Perchance as torches which must ready be\r\n    Men light, and put out, so thou deal'st with me.\r\n    Thou cam'st to kindle, goest to come: then I\r\n    Will dream that hope again, or else would die.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"O age of rusty iron! some better wit\r\n    Call it some worse name, if ought equal it.\r\n    Th' iron age was, when justice was sold: now\r\n    Injustice is sold dearer far; allow\r\n    All claim'd fees and duties, gamesters, anon\r\n    The money, which you sweat and swear for's gone\r\n    Into other hands; so controverted lands\r\n    'Scape, like Angelica, the striver's hands.\r\n    If law be in the judge's heart, and he\r\n    Have no heart to resist letter or fee,\r\n    Where wilt thou appeal? power of the courts below\r\n    Flows from the first main head, and these can throw\r\n    Thee, if they suck thee in, to misery,\r\n    To fetters, halters. But if th' injury\r\n    Steel thee to dare complain, alas! thou go'st\r\n    Against the stream upwards when thou art most\r\n    Heavy and most faint; and in these labours they\r\n    'Gainst whom thou should'st complain will in thy way\r\n    Become great seas, o'er which when thou shalt be\r\n    Forc'd to make golden bridges, thou shalt see\r\n    That all thy gold was drowned in them before.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"She, whose fair body no such prison was\r\n    But that a soul might well be pleased to pass\r\n    An age in her; she, whose rich beauty lent\r\n    Mintage to other beauties, for they went\r\n    But for so much as they were like to her;\r\n    She, in whose body (if we dare prefer\r\n    This low world to so high a mark as she),\r\n    The western treasure, eastern spicery,\r\n    Europe and Afric, and the unknown rest\r\n    Were easily found, or what in them was best;\r\n    And when we've made this large discovery\r\n    Of all, in her some one part then will be\r\n    Twenty such parts, whose plenty and riches is\r\n    Enough to make twenty such worlds as this;\r\n    She, whom had they known, who did first betroth\r\n    The tutelar angels and assigned one both\r\n    To nations, cities, and to companies,\r\n    To functions, offices, and dignities,\r\n    And to each several man, to him and him,\r\n    They would have giv'n her one for every limb;\r\n    She, of whose soul if we may say 'twas gold,\r\n    Her body was th' electrum and did hold\r\n    Many degrees of that; we understood\r\n    Her by her sight; _her pure and eloquent blood_\r\n    _Spoke in her cheeks, and so distinctly wrought_\r\n    _That one might almost say, her body thought_;\r\n    She, she thus richly and largely hous'd is gone\r\n    And chides us, slow-paced snails who crawl upon\r\n    Our prison's prison earth, nor think us well\r\n    Longer than whilst we bear our brittle shell.\"\r\n\r\nBut no short extracts will show Donne, and there is no room for a full\r\nanthology. He must be read, and by every catholic student of English\r\nliterature should be regarded with a respect only \"this side idolatry,\"\r\nthough the respect need not carry with it blindness to his undoubtedly\r\nglaring faults.\r\n\r\nThose faults are not least seen in his Satires, though neither the\r\nunbridled voluptuousness which makes his Elegies shocking to modern\r\npropriety, nor the far-off conceit which appears in his meditative and\r\nmiscellaneous poems, is very strongly or specially represented here. Nor,\r\nnaturally enough, is the extreme beauty of thought and allusion distinctly\r\nnoteworthy in a class of verse which does not easily admit it. On the other\r\nhand, the force and originality of Donne's intellect are nowhere better\r\nshown. It is a constant fault of modern satirists that in their just\r\nadmiration for Horace and Juvenal they merely paraphrase them, and, instead\r\nof going to the fountainhead and taking their matter from human nature,\r\nmerely give us fresh studies of _Ibam forte via sacra_ or the Tenth of\r\nJuvenal, adjusted to the meridians of Paris or London. Although Donne is\r\nnot quite free from this fault, he is much freer than either of his\r\ncontemporaries, Regnier or Hall. And the rough vigour of his sketches and\r\nsingle lines is admirable. Yet it is as rough as it is vigorous; and the\r\nbreakneck versification and contorted phrase of his satires, softened a\r\nlittle in Hall, roughened again and to a much greater degree in Marston,\r\nand reaching, as far as phrase goes, a rare extreme in the _Transformed\r\nMetamorphosis_ of Cyril Tourneur, have been the subject of a great deal of\r\ndiscussion. It is now agreed by all the best authorities that it would be a\r\nmistake to consider this roughness unintentional or merely clumsy, and that\r\nit sprung, at any rate in great degree, from an idea that the ancients\r\nintended the _Satura_ to be written in somewhat unpolished verse, as well\r\nas from a following of the style of Persius, the most deliberately obscure\r\nof all Latin if not of all classical poets. In language Donne is not (as\r\nfar as his Satires are concerned) a very great sinner; but his\r\nversification, whether by his own intention or not, leaves much to desire.\r\nAt one moment the ten syllables are only to be made out by a Chaucerian\r\nlengthening of the mute _e_; at another the writer seems to be emulating\r\nWyatt in altering the accent of syllables, and coolly making the final\r\niambus of a line out of such a word as \"answer.\" It is no wonder that poets\r\nof the \"correct\" age thought him in need of rewriting; though even they\r\ncould not mistake the force of observation and expression which\r\ncharacterises his Satires, and which very frequently reappears even in his\r\ndreamiest metaphysics, his most recondite love fancies, and his warmest and\r\nmost passionate hymns to Aphrodite Pandemos.\r\n\r\nThese artificial characteristics are supplemented in the Elizabethan\r\nsatirists, other than Donne, by yet a third, which makes them, I confess,\r\nto me rather tedious reading, independently of their shambling metre, and\r\ntheir sometimes almost unconstruable syntax. This is the absurd affectation\r\nof extreme moral wrath against the corruptions of their time in which they\r\nall indulge. Marston, who is nearly the foulest, if not quite the foulest\r\nwriter of any English classic, gives himself the airs of the most\r\nsensitive puritan; Hall, with a little less of this contrast, sins\r\nconsiderably in the same way, and adds to his delinquencies a most petulant\r\nand idle attempt to satirise from the purely literary point of view writers\r\nwho are a whole head and shoulders above himself. And these two, followed\r\nby their imitator, Guilpin, assail each other in a fashion which argues\r\neither a very absurd sincerity of literary jealousy, or a very ignoble\r\nsimulation of it, for the purpose of getting up interest on the part of the\r\npublic. Nevertheless, both Marston and Hall are very interesting figures in\r\nEnglish literature, and their satirical performances cannot be passed over\r\nin any account of it.\r\n\r\nJoseph Hall was born near Ashby de la Zouch, of parents in the lower yeoman\r\nrank of life, had his education at the famous Puritan College of Emanuel at\r\nCambridge, became a Fellow thereof, proceeded through the living of\r\nHawstead and a canonry at Wolverhampton to the sees of Exeter and Norwich,\r\nof the latter of which he was violently deprived by the Parliament, and,\r\nnot surviving long enough to see the Restoration, died (1656) in a suburb\r\nof his cathedral city. His later life was important for religious\r\nliterature and ecclesiastical politics, in his dealings with the latter of\r\nwhich he came into conflict, not altogether fortunately for the younger and\r\ngreater man of letters, with John Milton. His Satires belong to his early\r\nCambridge days, and to the last decade of the sixteenth century. They have\r\non the whole been rather overpraised, though the variety of their matter\r\nand the abundance of reference to interesting social traits of the time to\r\nsome extent redeem them. The worst point about them, as already noted, is\r\nthe stale and commonplace impertinence with which their author, unlike the\r\nbest breed of young poets and men of letters, attempts to satirise his\r\nliterary betters; while they are to some extent at any rate tarred with the\r\nother two brushes of corrupt imitation of the ancients, and of sham moral\r\nindignation. Indeed the want of sincerity--the evidence of the literary\r\nexercise--injures Hall's satirical work in different ways throughout. We do\r\nnot, as we read him, in the least believe in his attitude of Hebrew\r\nprophet crossed with Roman satirist, and the occasional presence of a\r\nvigorous couplet or a lively metaphor hardly redeems this disbelief.\r\nNevertheless, Hall is here as always a literary artist--a writer who took\r\nsome trouble with his writings; and as some of his satires are short, a\r\nwhole one may be given:--\r\n\r\n    \"A gentle squire would gladly entertain\r\n    Into his house some trencher-chaplain;[30]\r\n    Some willing man that might instruct his sons\r\n    And that would stand to good conditions.\r\n    First, that he lie upon the truckle bed,\r\n    Whiles his young master lieth o'er his head.\r\n    Second, that he do, on no default,[31]\r\n    Ever presume to sit above the salt.\r\n    Third, that he never change his trencher twice.\r\n    Fourth, that he use all common courtesies;\r\n    Sit bare at meals, and one half rise and wait.\r\n    Last, that he never his young master beat,\r\n    But he must ask his mother to define,\r\n    How many jerks she would his breech should line.\r\n    All these observ'd he could contented be\r\n    To give five marks and winter livery.\"\r\n\r\n[30] \"Chaplain\"--trisyllable like \"capellan.\"\r\n\r\n[31] Missing syllable.\r\n\r\nJohn Marston, who out-Halled Hall in all his literary misdeeds, was, it\r\nwould appear, a member of a good Shropshire family which had passed into\r\nWarwickshire. He was educated at Coventry School, and at Brasenose College,\r\nOxford, and passed early into London literary society, where he involved\r\nhimself in the inextricable and not-much-worth-extricating quarrels which\r\nhave left their mark in Jonson's and Dekker's dramas. In the first decade\r\nof the seventeenth century he wrote several remarkable plays, of much\r\ngreater literary merit than the work now to be criticised. Then he took\r\norders, was presented to the living of Christchurch, and, like others of\r\nhis time, seems to have forsworn literature as an unholy thing. He died in\r\n1634. Here we are concerned only with two youthful works of\r\nhis--_Pigmalion's Image_ and some Satires in 1598, followed in the same\r\nyear by a sequel, entitled _The Scourge of Villainy_. In these works he\r\ncalled himself \"W. Kinsayder,\" a pen-name for which various explanations\r\nhave been given. It is characteristic and rather comical that, while both\r\nthe earlier Satires and _The Scourge_ denounce lewd verse most\r\nfullmouthedly, _Pigmalion's Image_ is a poem in the _Venus and Adonis_\r\nstyle which is certainly not inferior to its fellows in luscious\r\ndescriptions. It was, in fact, with the _Satires_ and much similar work,\r\nformally condemned and burnt in 1599. Both in Hall and in Marston\r\nindustrious commentators have striven hard to identify the personages of\r\nthe satire with famous living writers, and there may be a chance that some\r\nat least of their identifications (as of Marston's Tubrio with Marlowe) are\r\ncorrect. But the exaggeration and insincerity, the deliberate\r\n\"society-journalism\" (to adopt a detestable phrase for a corresponding\r\nthing of our own days), which characterise all this class of writing make\r\nthe identifications of but little interest. In every age there are writers\r\nwho delight in representing that age as the very worst of the history of\r\nthe world, and in ransacking literature and imagination for accusations\r\nagainst their fellows. The sedate philosopher partly brings and partly\r\ndraws the conviction that one time is very like another. Marston, however,\r\nhas fooled himself and his readers to the very top of his and their bent;\r\nand even Churchill, restrained by a more critical atmosphere, has not come\r\nquite near his confused and only half-intelligible jumble of indictments\r\nfor indecent practices and crude philosophy of the moral and metaphysical\r\nkind. A vigorous line or phrase occasionally redeems the chaos of rant,\r\nfustian, indecency, ill-nature, and muddled thought.\r\n\r\n    \"Ambitious Gorgons, wide-mouth'd Lamians,\r\n    Shape-changing Proteans, damn'd Briarians,\r\n    Is Minos dead, is Radamanth asleep,\r\n    That ye thus dare unto Jove's palace creep?\r\n    What, hath Ramnusia spent her knotted whip,\r\n    That ye dare strive on Hebe's cup to sip?\r\n    Ye know Apollo's quiver is not spent,\r\n    But can abate your daring hardiment.\r\n    Python is slain, yet his accursed race\r\n    Dare look divine Astrea in the face;\r\n    Chaos return and with confusion\r\n    Involve the world with strange disunion;\r\n    For Pluto sits in that adored chair\r\n    Which doth belong unto Minerva's heir.\r\n    O hecatombs! O catastrophe!\r\n    From Midas' pomp to Trus' beggary!\r\n    Prometheus, who celestial fire\r\n    Did steal from heaven, therewith to inspire\r\n    Our earthly bodies with a sense-ful mind,\r\n    Whereby we might the depth of nature find,\r\n    Is ding'd to hell, and vulture eats his heart\r\n    Which did such deep philosophy impart\r\n    To mortal men.\"\r\n\r\nThe contrast of this so-called satire, and the really satiric touches of\r\nMarston's own plays, when he was not cramped by the affectations of the\r\nstyle, is very curious.\r\n\r\nEdward Gilpin or Guilpin, author of the rare book _Skialetheia_, published\r\nbetween the dates of Hall and Marston, is, if not a proved plagiarist from\r\neither, at any rate an obvious follower in the same track. There is the\r\nsame exaggeration, the same petulant ill-nature, the same obscurity of\r\nphrase and ungainliness of verse, and the same general insincerity. But the\r\nfine flower of the whole school is perhaps to be found in the miraculous\r\n_Transformed Metamorphosis_, attributed to the powerful but extravagant\r\ndramatist, Cyril Tourneur, who wrote this kind of thing:--\r\n\r\n    \"From out the lake a bridge ascends thereto,\r\n      Whereon in female shape a serpent stands.\r\n    Who eyes her eye, or views her blue-vein'd brow,\r\n      With sense-bereaving glozes she enchants,\r\n      And when she sees a worldling blind that haunts\r\n    The pleasure that doth seem there to be found,\r\n    She soothes with Leucrocutanized sound.\r\n\r\n    \"Thence leads an entry to a shining hall\r\n      Bedecked with flowers of the fairest hue;\r\n    The Thrush, the Lark, and night's-joy Nightingale\r\n      There minulize their pleasing lays anew,\r\n      This welcome to the bitter bed of rue;\r\n    This little room will scarce two wights contain\r\n    T' enjoy their joy, and there in pleasure reign.\r\n\r\n    \"But next thereto adjoins a spacious room,\r\n      More fairly fair adorned than the other:\r\n    (O woe to him at sin-awhaping doom,\r\n      That to these shadows hath his mind given over)\r\n      For (O) he never shall his soul recover:\r\n    If this sweet sin still feeds him with her smack\r\n    And his repentant hand him hales not back.\"[32]\r\n\r\n[32] Mr. Churton Collins is \"tolerably confident,\" and perhaps he might\r\nhave been quite certain, that Leucrocutanized refers to one of the Fauna of\r\nfancy,--a monster that spoke like a man. \"Minulise,\" from minurizo, \"I\r\nsing.\" \"To awhape\" = \"to confound.\"\r\n\r\nWe could hardly end with anything farther removed from the clear philosophy\r\nand the serene loveliness of _The Faerie Queene_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND DRAMATIC PERIOD--SHAKESPERE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of writing about Shakespere is twofold; and though it is a\r\ndifficulty which, in both its aspects, presents itself when other great\r\nwriters are concerned, there is no other case in which it besets the critic\r\nto quite the same extent. Almost everything that is worth saying has been\r\nalready said, more or less happily. A vast amount has been said which is\r\nnot in the least worth saying, which is for the most part demonstrably\r\nfoolish or wrong. As Shakespere is by far the greatest of all writers,\r\nancient or modern, so he has been the subject of commentatorial folly to an\r\nextent which dwarfs the expense of that folly on any other single subject.\r\nIt is impossible to notice the results of this folly except at great\r\nlength; it is doubtful whether they are worth noticing at all; yet there is\r\nalways the danger either that some mischievous notions may be left\r\nundisturbed by the neglect to notice them, or that the critic himself may\r\nbe presumed to be ignorant of the foolishness of his predecessors. These\r\ninconveniences, however, must here be risked, and it may perhaps be thought\r\nthat the necessity of risking them is a salutary one. In no other case is\r\nit so desirable that an author should be approached by students with the\r\nminimum of apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe scanty facts and the abundant fancies as to Shakespere's life are a\r\ncommonplace of literature. He was baptized on the 26th of April 1564 at\r\nStratford-on-Avon, and must have been born either on the same day, or on\r\none of those immediately preceding. His father was John Shakespere, his\r\nmother Mary Arden, both belonging to the lower middle class and connected,\r\npersonally and by their relations, with yeomanry and small landed gentry on\r\nthe one side, and with well-to-do tradesmen on the other. Nothing is known\r\nof his youth and little of his education; but it was a constant tradition\r\nof men of his own and the immediately succeeding generation that he had\r\nlittle school learning. Before he was nineteen he was married, at the end\r\nof November 1582, to Anne Hathaway, who was seven years his senior. Their\r\nfirst child, Susannah, was baptized six months later. He is said to have\r\nleft Stratford for London in 1585, or thereabouts, and to have connected\r\nhimself at once with the theatre, first in humble and then in more\r\nimportant positions. But all this is mist and myth. He is transparently\r\nreferred to by Robert Greene in the summer or autumn of 1592, and the terms\r\nof the reference prove his prosperity. The same passage brought out a\r\ncomplimentary reference to Shakespere's intellectual and moral character\r\nfrom Chettle, Greene's editor. He published _Venus and Adonis_ in 1593, and\r\n_Lucrece_ next year. His plays now began to appear rapidly, and brought him\r\nmoney enough to buy, in 1597, the house of New Place at Stratford, and to\r\nestablish himself there after, it is supposed, twelve years' almost\r\ncomplete absence from his birthplace and his family. Documentary references\r\nto his business matters now become not infrequent, but, except as showing\r\nthat he was alive and prosperous, they are quite uninteresting. The same\r\nmay be said of the marriages and deaths of his children. In 1609 appeared\r\nthe _Sonnets_, some of which had previously been printed in unauthorised\r\nand piratical publications. He died on the 23d of April (supposed generally\r\nto be his birthday) 1616, and was buried at Stratford. His plays had been\r\nonly surreptitiously printed, the retention of a play in manuscript being\r\nof great importance to the actors, and the famous first folio did not\r\nappear till seven years after his death.\r\n\r\nThe canon of Shakespere's plays, like everything else connected with him,\r\nhas been the subject of endless discussion. There is no reasonable doubt\r\nthat in his earlier days (the first printed play among those ordinarily\r\nassigned to him, _Romeo and Juliet_, dates from 1597) he had taken part in\r\ndramatic work which is now mostly anonymous or assigned to other men, and\r\nthere is also no doubt that there may be passages in the accepted plays\r\nwhich he owed to others. But my own deliberate judgment is that no\r\nimportant and highly probable ascription of extant work to Shakespere can\r\nbe made outside the canon as usually printed, with the doubtful exception\r\nof _The Two Noble Kinsmen_; and I do not believe that in the plays usually\r\naccepted, any very important or characteristic portion is not Shakespere's.\r\nAs for Shakespere-Bacon theories, and that kind of folly, they are scarcely\r\nworthy even of mention. Nor among the numerous other controversies and\r\nerrors on the subject shall I meddle with more than one--the constantly\r\nrepeated assertion that England long misunderstood or neglected Shakespere,\r\nand that foreign aid, chiefly German (though some include Voltaire!), was\r\nrequired to make her discover him. A very short way is possible with this\r\nabsurdity. It would be difficult to name any men more representative of\r\ncultivated literary opinion and accomplishment in the six generations\r\n(taking a generation at the third of a century) which passed between\r\nShakespere's death and the battle of Waterloo (since when English\r\nadmiration of Shakespere will hardly be denied), than Ben Jonson, John\r\nMilton, John Dryden, Alexander Pope, Samuel Johnson, and Samuel Taylor\r\nColeridge. Their lives overlapped each other considerably, so that no\r\nperiod is left uncovered. They were all typical men of letters, each of his\r\nown time, and four at least of them were literary dictators. Now, Ben\r\nJonson's estimate of Shakespere in prose and verse is on record in more\r\nplaces than one, and is as authentic as the silly stories of his envy are\r\nmythical. If Milton, to his eternal disgrace, flung, for party purposes,\r\nthe study of Shakespere as a reproach in his dead king's face, he had\r\nhimself long before put on record his admiration for him, and his own\r\nstudy is patent to every critical reader of his works. Dryden, but a year\r\nor two after the death of Shakespere's daughter, drew up that famous and\r\nmemorable eulogy which ought to be familiar to all, and which, long before\r\nany German had spoken of Shakespere, and thirty years before Voltaire had\r\ncome into the world, exactly and precisely based the structure of\r\nShakespere-worship. Pope edited Shakespere. Johnson edited him. Coleridge\r\nis acknowledged as, with his contemporaries Lamb and Hazlitt, the founder\r\nof modern appreciation. It must be a curious reckoning which, in face of\r\nsuch a catena as this, stretching its links over the whole period,\r\nmaintains that England wanted Germans to teach her how to admire the writer\r\nwhom Germans have done more to mystify and distort than even his own\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nThe work of Shakespere falls into three divisions very unequal in bulk.\r\nThere is first (speaking both in the order of time and in that of thought,\r\nthough not in that of literary importance and interest) the small division\r\nof poems, excluding the _Sonnets_, but including _Venus and Adonis_, _The\r\nRape of Lucrece_, and the few and uncertain but exquisite scraps, the\r\n_Lover's Complaint_, _The Passionate Pilgrim_, and so forth. All these are\r\nlikely to have been the work of early youth, and they are much more like\r\nthe work of other men than any other part of Shakespere's work, differing\r\nchiefly in the superior sweetness of those wood-notes wild, which Milton\r\njustly, if not altogether adequately, attributed to the poet, and in the\r\noccasional appearance of the still more peculiar and unique touches of\r\nsympathy with and knowledge of universal nature which supply the main\r\nShakesperian note. The _Venus_ and the _Lucrece_ form part of a large\r\ncollection (see last chapter) of extremely luscious, not to say voluptuous,\r\npoetry which the imitation of Italian models introduced into England, which\r\nhas its most perfect examples in the earlier of these two poems, in\r\nnumerous passages of Spenser, and in the _Hero and Leander_ of Marlowe, but\r\nwhich was written, as will have been seen from what has been already said,\r\nwith extraordinary sweetness and abundance, by a vast number of\r\nElizabethan writers. There are extant mere _adespota_, and mere \"minor\r\npoems\" (such as the pretty \"Britain's Ida,\" which used to be printed as\r\nSpenser's, and which some critics have rather rashly given to Phineas\r\nFletcher), good enough to have made reputation, if not fortune, at other\r\ntimes. There is no reason to attribute to Shakespere on the one hand, any\r\ndeliberate intention of executing a _tour de force_ in the composition of\r\nthese poems or, in his relinquishment of the style, any deliberate\r\nrejection of the kind as unworthy of his powers on the other. He appears to\r\nhave been eminently one of those persons who care neither to be in nor out\r\nof the fashion, but follow it as far as suits and amuses them. Yet,\r\nbeautiful as these poems are, they so manifestly do not present their\r\nauthor at the full of his powers, or even preluding in the kind wherein the\r\nbest of those powers were to be shown, that they require comparatively\r\nlittle critical notice. As things delightful to read they can hardly be\r\nplaced too high, especially the _Venus_; as evidences of the poet's\r\nmany-sided nature, they are interesting. But they are in somewhat other\r\nthan the usual sense quite \"simple, sensuous, and passionate.\" The\r\nmisplaced ingenuity which, neglecting the _unum necessarium_, will busy\r\nitself about all sorts of unnecessary things, has accordingly been rather\r\nhard put to it with them, and to find any pasture at all has had to browse\r\non questions of dialect, and date, and personal allusion, even more jejune\r\nand even more unsubstantial than usual.\r\n\r\nIt is quite otherwise with the _Sonnets_. In the first place nowhere in\r\nShakespere's work is it more necessary to brush away the cobwebs of the\r\ncommentators. This side of madness, no vainer fancies have ever entered the\r\nmind of man than those which have been inspired by the immaterial part of\r\nthe matter. The very initials of the dedicatee \"W. H.\" have had volumes\r\nwritten about them; the _Sonnets_ themselves have been twisted and\r\nclassified in every conceivable shape; the persons to whom they are\r\naddressed, or to whom they refer, have been identified with half the\r\ngentlemen and ladies of Elizabeth's court, and half the men of letters of\r\nthe time; and every extremity and eccentricity of non-natural\r\ninterpretation has been applied to them. When they are freed from this\r\ntorture and studied rationally, there is nothing mysterious about them\r\nexcept the mystery of their poetical beauty. Some of them are evidently\r\naddressed in the rather hyperbolical language of affection, common at the\r\ntime, and derived from the study of Greek and Italian writers, to a man;\r\nothers, in language not hyperbolical at all, to a woman. Disdain, rivalry,\r\nsuspense, short-lived joy, long sorrow, all the symptoms and concomitants\r\nof the passion of love--which are only commonplaces as death and life are\r\ncommonplace--form their motives. For my part I am unable to find the\r\nslightest interest or the most rudimentary importance in the questions\r\nwhether the Mr. W. H. of the dedication was the Earl of Pembroke, and if\r\nso, whether he was also the object of the majority of the _Sonnets_;\r\nwhether the \"dark lady,\" the \"woman coloured ill,\" was Miss Mary Fitton;\r\nwhether the rival poet was Chapman. Very likely all these things are true:\r\nvery likely not one of them is true. They are impossible of settlement, and\r\nif they were settled they would not in the slightest degree affect the\r\npoetical beauty and the human interest of the _Sonnets_, which, in a\r\nstrange _reductio ad absurdum_ of eighteenth century commonsense criticism,\r\nHallam thought it impossible not to wish that Shakespere had not written,\r\nand which some critics, not perhaps of the least qualified, have regarded\r\nas the high-water mark of English, if not of all, poetry.\r\n\r\nThis latter estimate will only be dismissed as exaggerated by those who are\r\ndebarred from appreciation by want of sympathy with the subject, or\r\ndistracted by want of comprehension of it. A harmony of the two chief\r\nopposing theories of poetry will teach us that we must demand of the very\r\nhighest poetry first--the order is not material--a certain quality of\r\nexpression, and secondly, a certain quality of subject. \"What that quality\r\nof subject must be has been, as it seems to me, crudely and wrongly stated,\r\nbut rightly indicated, in Mr. Matthew Arnold's formula of the \"Criticism\r\nof Life.\" That is to say, in less debatable words, the greatest poet must\r\nshow most knowledge of human nature. Now both these conditions are\r\nfulfilled in the sonnets of Shakespere with a completeness and intensity\r\nimpossible to parallel elsewhere. The merits of the formal and expressive\r\npart hardly any one will now question; the sonnets may be opened almost at\r\nrandom with the certainty of finding everywhere the phrases, the verses,\r\nthe passages which almost mechanically recur to our minds when we are asked\r\nto illustrate the full poetical capacity and beauty of the English tongue,\r\nsuch as:\r\n\r\n    \"The painful warrior, famoused for fight,\r\n    After a thousand victories once foiled,\r\n    Is from the book of honour razed quite\r\n    And all the rest forgot for which he toiled;\"\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    \"When to the sessions of sweet silent thought\r\n    I summon up remembrance of things past;\"\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    \"Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,\r\n    Bound for the prize of all too precious you?\"\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    \"Then hate me if thou wilt,\"\r\n\r\nwith the whole sonnet which it opens; or\r\n\r\n    \"When in the chronicle of a wasted time\r\n    I see descriptions of the fairest wights,\r\n    And beauty making beautiful old rhyme\r\n    In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights;\"\r\n\r\nor that most magnificent quatrain of all,\r\n\r\n    \"Let me not to the marriage of true minds\r\n    Admit impediments. Love is not love\r\n    Which alters when it alteration finds,\r\n    Or bends with the remover to remove.\"\r\n\r\nAny competent judge of the formal part of poetry must admit that its force\r\ncan no farther go. Verse and phrase cannot be better moulded to the\r\nmelodious suggestion of beauty. Nor, as even these scraps show, is the\r\nthought below the verse. Even if Hallam's postulate of misplaced and\r\nill-regulated passion be granted (and I am myself very far from granting\r\nit), the extraordinary wealth of thought, of knowledge, of nature, of\r\nself-knowledge, of clear vision of others in the very midst of the\r\ncircumstances which might make for unclear vision, is still unmistakable.\r\nAnd if the poet's object was to catch up the sum of love and utter it with\r\nor even without any special relation to his own actual feelings for any\r\nactual person (a hypothesis which human nature in general, and the nature\r\nof poets in particular, makes not improbable), then it can only be said\r\nthat he has succeeded. From Sappho and Solomon to Shelley and Mr.\r\nSwinburne, many bards have spoken excellently of love: but what they have\r\nsaid could be cut out of Shakespere's sonnets better said than they have\r\nsaid it, and yet enough remain to furnish forth the greatest of poets.\r\n\r\nWith the third and in every sense chief division of the work, the\r\nnecessities for explanation and allowance cease altogether. The\r\nthirty-seven plays of the ordinary Shakesperian canon comprise the\r\ngreatest, the most varied, the most perfect work yet done by any man in\r\nliterature; and what is more, the work of which they consist is on the\r\nwhole the most homogeneous and the least unequal ever so done. The latter\r\nstatement is likely to be more questioned than the former; but I have no\r\nfear of failing to make it out. In one sense, no doubt, Shakespere is\r\nunequal--as life is. He is not always at the tragic heights of Othello and\r\nHamlet, at the comic raptures of Falstaff and Sir Toby, at the romantic\r\necstasies of Romeo and Titania. Neither is life. But he is always--and this\r\nis the extraordinary and almost inexplicable difference, not merely between\r\nhim and all his contemporaries, but between him and all other writers--at\r\nthe height of the particular situation. This unique quality is uniquely\r\nillustrated in his plays. The exact order of their composition is entirely\r\nunknown, and the attempts which have been made to arrange it into periods,\r\nmuch more to rank play after play in regular sequence, are obvious\r\nfailures, and are discredited not merely by the inadequate means--such as\r\ncounting syllables and attempting to classify the cadence of\r\nlines--resorted to in order to effect them, but by the hopeless discrepancy\r\nbetween the results of different investigators and of the same investigator\r\nat different times. We know indeed pretty certainly that _Romeo and Juliet_\r\nwas an early play, and _Cymbeline_ a late one, with other general facts of\r\nthe same kind. We know pretty certainly that the _Henry the Sixth_ series\r\nwas based on a previous series on the same subject in which Shakespere not\r\nimprobably had a hand; that _King John_ and _The Taming of the Shrew_ had\r\nin the same way first draughts from the same or other hands, and so forth.\r\nBut all attempts to arrange and elucidate a chronological development of\r\nShakespere's mind and art have been futile. Practically the Shakesperian\r\ngifts are to be found _passim_ in the Shakesperian canon--even in the\r\ndullest of all the plays, as a whole, _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_, even\r\nin work so alien from his general practice, and so probably mixed with\r\nother men's work, as _Titus Andronicus_ and _Pericles_. There are rarely\r\nelsewhere--in _The Maid's Tragedy_ of Fletcher, in _The Duchess of Malfi_\r\nof Webster, in _The Changeling_ of Middleton--passages or even scenes which\r\nmight conceivably have been Shakespere's. But there is, with the doubtful\r\nexception of _The Two Noble Kinsmen_, no play in any other man's work which\r\nas a whole or in very great part is Shakesperian, and there is no play\r\nusually recognised as Shakespere's which would not seem out of place and\r\nstartling in the work of any contemporary.\r\n\r\nThis intense, or rather (for intense is not the right word) this\r\nextraordinarily diffused character, is often supposed to be a mere fancy of\r\nShakespere-worshippers. It is not so. There is something, not so much in\r\nthe individual flashes of poetry, though it is there too, as in the entire\r\nscope and management of Shakespere's plays, histories, tragedies, and\r\ncomedies alike, which distinguishes them, and it is exactly the\r\ncharacteristic noted above, and well put by Dryden in his famous\r\ndefinition of Shakespere. Perhaps the first branch or phase of this\r\ndistinction is that Shakespere is never, in the vulgar sense of the word,\r\nunnatural. He has not the slightest objection to horrors; the alarmed\r\nforeign critics who described his theatre as a \"shambles\" need not have\r\ngone farther than his greatest plays to justify themselves literally. But\r\nwith barely even the exception which has so often to be made of _Titus\r\nAndronicus_, his horrors are never sought beyond a certain usual and\r\nprobable round of circumstance, and are almost always tempered and\r\nhumanised by touches of humour or pathos, or both. The cool sarcastic\r\nvillany of Aaron (a mood hit off nowhere out of Shakespere, except in\r\nMiddleton's De Flores, and not fully there) is the point on which I should\r\nchiefly put the finger to justify at least a partial Shakesperian\r\nauthorship. Contrast the character with the nightmare ghastlinesses and\r\nextravagances not merely of Tourneur and Webster, but even of Marlowe in\r\nBarabas, and the difference of Shakespere's handling will be felt at once.\r\nAnother point which has been often, yet perhaps not quite fully, noticed is\r\nthe distinct and peculiar attitude of Shakespere towards what is in the\r\ncommon sense called morality. Nobody can possibly call him squeamish: I do\r\nnot know that even any French naturalist of the latest school has charged\r\nthe author of _Pericles_, and _Love's Labour Lost_, and _Henry IV._, with\r\nthat _pruderie bete_ of which they accuse Scott. But he never makes those\r\nforms of vice which most trouble and corrupt society triumphant; he never\r\ndiverges into the morbid pathology of the amatory passion, and above all,\r\nand most remarkably of all, though I think least remarked, he never makes\r\nhis personages show the singular toleration of the most despicable\r\nimmorality which almost all his dramatic contemporaries exhibit. One is\r\nconstantly astonished at the end of an Elizabethan play, when, after vice\r\nhas been duly baffled or punished, and virtue rewarded (for they all more\r\nor less follow that rule), reconciliations and forgivenesses of injuries\r\nfollow, to observe the complacency with which husbands who have sold their\r\nwives' favours, wives who have been at the command of the first comer or\r\nthe highest bidder, mix cheek by jowl, and apparently unrebuked, with the\r\nmodest maidens, the virtuous matrons, the faithful lovers of the piece.\r\nShakespere never does this. Mrs. Quickly is indeed at one time the\r\nconfidante of Anne Fenton, and at another the complaisant hostess of Doll\r\nTear-sheet, but not in the same play. We do not find Marina's master and\r\nmistress rewarded, as they would very likely have been by Fletcher or\r\nMiddleton, with comfortable if not prominent posts at the court of\r\nPericles, or the Government-house of Mytilene. The ugly and artistically\r\nunmanageable situation of the husband who trades in his wife's honour\r\nsimply does not occur in all the wide license and variety of Shakespere's\r\nforty plays. He is in his own sense liberal as the most easy going can\r\ndemand, but he never mixes vice and virtue. Yet again, while practising\r\nthis singular moderation in the main element, in the most fertile motives,\r\nof tragedy and comedy respectively, he is equally alone in his use in both\r\nof the element of humour. And here we are on dangerous ground. To many\r\nexcellent persons of all times since his own, as well as in it,\r\nShakespere's humour and his use of it have been stumbling-blocks. Some of\r\nthem have been less able to away with the use, some with the thing.\r\nShakesperian clowns are believed to be red rags to some experienced\r\nplaywrights and accomplished wits of our own days: the porter in _Macbeth_,\r\nthe gravediggers in _Hamlet_, the fool in _Lear_, even the humours in\r\n_Love's Labour Lost_ and _The Merchant of Venice_ have offended. I avow\r\nmyself an impenitent Shakesperian in this respect also. The constant or\r\nalmost constant presence of that humour which ranges from the sarcastic\r\nquintessence of Iago, and the genial quintessence of Falstaff, through the\r\nfantasies of Feste and Edgar, down to the sheer nonsense which not\r\nunfrequently occurs, seems to me not only delightful in itself, but, as I\r\nhave hinted already, one of the chief of those spells by which Shakespere\r\nhas differentiated his work in the sense of universality from that of all\r\nother dramatists. I have used the word nonsense, and I may be thought to\r\nhave partly given up my case by it. But nonsense, as hardly any critic but\r\nHazlitt has had the courage to avow openly, is no small part of life, and\r\nit is a part the relish of which Englishmen, as the same great but unequal\r\ncritic justly maintains, are almost alone in enjoying and recognising. It\r\nis because Shakespere dares, and dares very frequently, simply _desipere_,\r\nsimply to be foolish, that he is so pre-eminently wise. The others try to\r\nbe always wise, and, alas! it is not necessary to complete the antithesis.\r\n\r\nThese three things--restraint in the use of sympathy with suffering,\r\nrestraint in the use of interest in voluptuous excess, and humour--are, as\r\nit seems to me, the three chief distinguishing points in Shakespere's\r\nhandling which are not found in any of his contemporaries, for though there\r\nis humour in not a few of these, none of them is a perfect humorist in the\r\nsame sense. Here, as well as in that general range or width of subject and\r\nthought which attracted Dryden's eulogium, he stands alone. In other\r\nrespects he shares the qualities which are perceptible almost throughout\r\nthis wonderfully fertile department of literature; but he shares them as\r\ninfinitely the largest shareholder. It is difficult to think of any other\r\npoet (for with Homer we are deprived of the opportunity of comparison) who\r\nwas so completely able to meet any one of his contemporaries on that\r\ncontemporary's own terms in natural gift. I say natural gift because,\r\nthough it is quite evident that Shakespere was a man of no small reading,\r\nhis deficiencies in general education are too constantly recorded by\r\ntradition, and rendered too probable by internal evidence, to be ignored or\r\ndenied by any impartial critic. But it is difficult to mention a quality\r\npossessed by any of the school (as it is loosely called), from Marlowe to\r\nShirley, which he had not in greater measure; while the infinite qualities\r\nwhich he had, and the others each in one way or another lacked, are\r\nevident. On only one subject--religion--is his mouth almost closed;\r\ncertainly, as the few utterances that touch it show, from no incapacity of\r\ndealing with it, and apparently from no other dislike than a dislike to\r\nmeddle with anything outside of the purely human province of which he felt\r\nthat he was universal master--in short from an infinite reverence.\r\n\r\nIt will not be expected that in a book like the present--the whole space of\r\nwhich might very well be occupied, without any of the undue dilation which\r\nhas been more than once rebuked, in dealing with Shakespere alone--any\r\nattempt should be made to criticise single plays, passages, and characters.\r\nIt is the less of a loss that in reality, as the wisest commentators have\r\nalways either begun or ended by acknowledging, Shakespere is your only\r\ncommentator on Shakespere. Even the passages which corrupt printing, or the\r\ninvolved fashion of speaking peculiar to the time, make somewhat obscure at\r\nfirst, will in almost every case yield to the unassisted cogitation of any\r\nordinarily intelligent person; and the results so reached are far more\r\nlikely to be the true results than the elaborate emendations which delight\r\na certain class of editors. A certain amount of mere glossary is of course\r\nnecessary, but otherwise the fewer corks and bladders the swimmer takes\r\nwith him when he ventures into \"the ocean which is Shakespere,\" the better.\r\nThere are, however, certain common errors, some of which have survived even\r\nthe last century of Shakespere-study and Shakespere-worship, which must\r\nperhaps be discussed. For in the case of the greatest writers, the business\r\nof the critic is much more to shovel away the rubbish of his predecessors\r\nthan to attempt any accumulation of his own. The chief of these errors--or\r\nrather that error which practically swallows up all the others and can\r\nproduce them again at any time--is that Shakespere was, if not exactly an\r\ninspired idiot, at any rate a mainly tentative if not purely unconscious\r\nartist, much of whose work is only not bad as art, while most, if not all\r\nof it, was originally produced with a minimum of artistic consciousness and\r\ndesign. This enormous error, which is protean in form, has naturally\r\ninduced the counter error of a too great insistence on the consciousness\r\nand elaboration of Shakespere's art. The most elaborate theories of this\r\nart have been framed--theories involving the construction of perhaps as\r\nmuch baseless fabric as anything else connected with the subject, which is\r\nsaying a great deal. It appears to me in the highest degree improbable that\r\nShakespere had before him consciously more than three purposes; but these\r\nthree I think that he constantly had, and that he was completely successful\r\nin achieving them. The first was to tell in every play a dramatically\r\ncomplete story; the second was to work that story out by the means of\r\npurely human and probable characters; and the third was to give such form\r\nand ornaments to the working out as might please the playgoers of his day.\r\nIn pursuing the first two he was the poet or dramatist of all time. In\r\npursuing the third he was the intelligent playwright. But (and here is the\r\nsource of the common error) it by no means follows that his attention, and\r\nhis successful attention, to his third purpose in any way interferes with,\r\nor degrades, his excellence as a pursuer of the first two. In the first\r\nplace, it can escape no careful student that the merely playwright part of\r\nShakespere's work is (as is the case with no other dramatic author\r\nwhatever) singularly separable. No generation since his death has had the\r\nslightest difficulty in adapting by far the greater part of his plays to\r\nuse and popularity in its own day, though the adaptation may have varied in\r\nliberty and in good taste with the standards of the time. At the present\r\nday, while almost all other old dramatists have ceased to be acted at all,\r\nor are acted merely as curiosities, the adaptation of Shakespere has become\r\nmore and more a process of simple omission (without the addition or\r\nalteration of anything) of parts which are either unsuited to modern\r\nmanners or too long for modern patience. With the two usual exceptions,\r\n_Pericles_ and _Titus Andronicus_ (which, despite the great beauty of\r\nparts, are evidently less Shakesperian as wholes than any others), there is\r\nnot a single play of the whole number that could not be--there are not many\r\nthat have not been--acted with success in our time. It would be difficult\r\nto find a stronger differentia from the work of the mere playwright, who\r\ninvariably thinks first of the temporary conditions of success, and\r\naccordingly loses the success which is not temporary. But the second great\r\ndifference of Shakespere is, that even what may be in comparison called\r\nthe ephemeral and perishable parts of him have an extraordinary vitality,\r\nif not theatrical yet literary, of their own. The coarser scenes of\r\n_Measure for Measure_ and _The Comedy of Errors_, the satire on fleeting\r\nfollies in _Love's Labour Lost_, the uncomelier parts of _All's Well that\r\nEnds Well_, the Doll Tear-sheet business of _Henry IV._, the comic by-play\r\nof _Troilus and Cressida_, may seem mere wood, hay, and stubble in\r\ncomparison with the nobler portions. Yet the fire of time has not consumed\r\nthem: they are as delightful as ever in the library if not on the stage.\r\n\r\nLittle or nothing need be said in defence of Shakespere as an artist from\r\nthe attacks of the older or Unity criticism. That maleficent giant can now\r\nhardly grin at the pilgrims whom he once harassed. But there are many\r\npersons who, not dreaming of the Unities, still object in language less\r\nextravagant than Voltaire's or George the Third's, but with hardly less\r\ndecision, to the \"sad stuff,\" the _fumier_ of Shakespere's admixture of\r\ncomedy with tragedy, of his digressions and episodes, of his multifarious\r\nunderplots and minor groups, and ramifications of interest or intrigue. The\r\nreply to this is not (as it might be, if any reply were not superfluous, in\r\nthe case of the Unity objection) a reply of demonstration. If any person\r\nexperienced in literature, and with an interest in it, experienced in life\r\nand with an interest in that, asserts that Caliban and Trinculo interfere\r\nwith his enjoyment of Ferdinand and Miranda; that the almost tragedy of\r\nHero is marred for him by the comedy of Beatrice and the farce of Dogberry;\r\nthat he would have preferred _A Midsummer Night's Dream_ without the\r\ntedious brief effort of Quince and his companions; that the solemnity and\r\npassion of _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_ cause in him a revulsion against the\r\nporter and the gravedigger; that the Fool and Edgar are out of place in\r\n_Lear_,--it is impossible to prove to him by the methods of any Euclid or\r\nof any Aldrich that he is wrong. The thing is essentially, if not wholly, a\r\nmatter of taste. It is possible, indeed, to point out, as in the case of\r\nthe Unities, that the objectors, if they will maintain their objection,\r\nmust deny the position that the dramatic art holds up the mirror to Nature,\r\nand that if they deny it, the burden--a burden never yet successfully taken\r\nup by any one--of framing a new definition rests upon them. But this is\r\nonly a partial and somewhat inconclusive argument, and the person who\r\ngenuinely dislikes these peculiarities of Shakespere is like a man who\r\ngenuinely dislikes wine or pictures or human faces, that seem delightful\r\nand beautiful to others. I am not aware of any method whereby I can prove\r\nthat the most perfect claret is better than zoedone in flavour, or that the\r\nmost exquisite creation of Botticelli or Leonardo is more beautiful than\r\nthe cuts on the sides of railway novels. Again, it is matter of taste.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that I am not for my part afraid to avow myself a\r\nthoroughgoing Shakesperian, who accepts the weak points of his master as\r\nwell as the strong. It is often forgotten (indeed I do not know where I\r\nhave seen it urged) that there is in Shakespere's case an excuse for the\r\nthousand lines that good Ben Jonson would have liked him to blot,--an\r\nexcuse which avails for no one else. No one else has his excuse of\r\nuniversality; no one else has attempted to paint, much less has painted,\r\nthe whole of life. It is because Shakespere has attempted this, and, in the\r\njudgment of at least some, has succeeded in it, that the spots in his sun\r\nare so different from the spots in all other suns. I do not know an\r\nunnatural character or an unnatural scene in Shakespere, even among those\r\nwhich have most evidently been written to the gallery. Everything in him\r\npasses, in some mysterious way, under and into that \"species of eternity\"\r\nwhich transforms all the great works of art, which at once prevents them\r\nfrom being mere copies of Nature, and excuses whatever there is of Nature\r\nin them that is not beautiful or noble. If this touch is wanting anywhere\r\n(and it is wanting very seldom), that, I take it, is the best, indeed the\r\nonly, sign that that passage is not Shakespere's,--that he had either made\r\nuse of some other man's work, or that some other man had made use of his.\r\nIf such passages were of more frequent occurrence, this argument might be\r\ncalled a circular one. But the proportion of such passages as I at least\r\nshould exclude is so small, and the difference between them and the rest is\r\nso marked, that no improper begging of the question can be justly charged.\r\nThe plays in the _Globe_ edition contain just a thousand closely-printed\r\npages. I do not think that there are fifty in all, perhaps not\r\ntwenty--putting scraps and patches together--in which the Shakesperian\r\ntouch is wanting, and I do not think that that touch appears outside the\r\ncovers of the volume once in a thousand pages of all the rest of English\r\nliterature. The finest things of other men,--of Marlowe, of Fletcher, of\r\nWebster (who no doubt comes nearest to the Shakesperian touch, infinitely\r\nas he falls short of the Shakesperian range),--might conceivably be the\r\nwork of others. But the famous passages of Shakespere, too numerous and too\r\nwell known to quote, could be no one else's. It is to this point that\r\naesthetic criticism of Shakespere is constantly coming round with an almost\r\nmonotonous repetition. As great as all others in their own points of\r\ngreatness; holding points of greatness which no others even approach; such\r\nis Shakespere.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain difficulty--most easily to be appreciated by those who\r\nhave most carefully studied the literature of the period in question, and\r\nhave most fully perceived the mistakes which confusion of exact date has\r\ninduced in the consideration of the very complex subject before us--in\r\nselecting dramatists to group with Shakespere. The obvious resource of\r\ntaking him by himself would frustrate the main purpose of this volume,\r\nwhich is to show the general movement at the same time as the individual\r\ndevelopments of the literature of 1560-1660. In one sense Shakespere might\r\nbe included in any one of three out of the four chapters which we have here\r\ndevoted to the Elizabethan dramatists. His earliest known, and probably\r\nmuch of his unknown work coincides with the period of tentative; and his\r\nlatest work overlaps very much of that period of ripe and somewhat\r\nover-ripe performance, at the head of which it has here been thought good\r\nto set Beaumont and Fletcher. But there is a group of four notable persons\r\nwho appear to have especial rights to be classed with him, if not in\r\ngreatness, yet in character of work, and in the influences which played on\r\nthat work. They all, like him, took an independent part in the marvellous\r\nwit-combat of the last decade of Elizabeth, and they all like him survived,\r\nthough for different lengths of time, to set an example to the third\r\ngeneration. They are all, even the meanest of them, distinctly great men,\r\nand free alike from the immaturity, visible even in Lyly and Marlowe, which\r\nmarked some of their older contemporaries, and from the decadence, visible\r\neven in Fletcher and Massinger, which marred their younger followers.\r\nFurthermore, they were mixed up, as regards one another, in an inextricable\r\nbut not uninteresting series of broils and friendships, to some part of\r\nwhich Shakespere himself may have been by no means a stranger. These\r\nreasons have seemed sufficient for separating them from the rest, and\r\ngrouping them round the captain. They are Benjamin Jonson, George Chapman,\r\nJohn Marston, and Thomas Dekker.\r\n\r\nThe history of Ben Jonson (the literary history that is to say, for the\r\nknown facts of his life are simple enough) is curious and perhaps unique.\r\nNothing is really known of his family; but as, at a time when Scotchmen\r\nwere not loved in England, he maintained his Annandale origin, there should\r\nbe, especially after Mr. Symonds's investigations as to his career, no\r\ndoubt that he at least believed himself to be of Border extraction, as was\r\nalso, it may be remembered, his great disciple, panegyrist, slanderer, and\r\n(with the substitution of an easy for a rugged temper), analogue, John\r\nDryden. The fact of these two typical Englishmen being of half or whole\r\nScotch descent will not surprise any one who does not still ignore the\r\nproper limits of England. Nobody doubts that his father (or rather\r\nstepfather, for he was a posthumous child, born 1573, and his mother\r\nmarried again) was a bricklayer, or that he went to Westminster School; it\r\nseems much more dubious whether he had any claim to anything but an\r\nhonorary degree from either university, though he received that from both.\r\nProbably he worked at bricklaying, though the taunts of his rivals would,\r\nin face of the undoubted fact of his stepfather's profession, by no means\r\nsuffice to prove it. Certainly he went through the chequered existence of\r\nso many Elizabethan men of letters; was a soldier in Flanders, an actor, a\r\nduellist (killing his man, and escaping consequences only by benefit of\r\nclergy), a convert to Romanism, a \"revert\" to the Anglican Church, a\r\nmarried man, a dramatist. The great play of _Every Man in his Humour_,\r\nafterwards very much altered, was perhaps acted first at the Rose Theatre\r\nin 1596, and it established Jonson's reputation, though there is no\r\nreasonable doubt that he had written other things. His complicated\r\nassociations and quarrels with Dekker, Marston, Chapman, and others, have\r\noccupied the time of a considerable number of persons; they lie quite\r\nbeyond our subject, and it may be observed without presumption that their\r\ndirect connection, even with the literary work (_The Poetaster_,\r\n_Satiromastix_, and the rest) which is usually linked to them, will be\r\nbetter established when critics have left off being uncertain whether _A_\r\nwas _B_, or _B_, _C_. Even the most famous story of all (the disgrace of\r\nJonson with others for _Eastward Ho!_ as a libel against the Scots, for\r\nwhich he was imprisoned, and, being threatened with mutilation, was by his\r\nRoman mother supplied with poison), though told by himself, does not rest\r\non any external evidence. What is certain is that Jonson was in great and\r\ngreater request, both as a writer of masks and other _divertissements_ for\r\nthe Court, and as a head and chief of literary conviviality at the\r\n\"Mermaid,\" and other famous taverns. Here, as he grew older, there grew up\r\nround him that \"Tribe of Ben,\" or admiring clique of young literary men,\r\nwhich included almost all the most remarkable poets, except Milton, of the\r\nlate Jacobean and early Caroline period, and which helped to spread his\r\nfame for at least two generations, and (by Waller's influence on\r\nSaint-Evremond) to make him the first English man of letters who was\r\nintroduced by a great critic of the Continent to continental attention as a\r\nworker in the English vernacular. At last he was made Poet Laureate, and\r\nin 1618 he took a journey to Scotland, and stayed there for some time with\r\nDrummond of Hawthornden. The celebrated conversations noted by the host\r\nhave been the very centre battle-ground of all fights about Ben Jonson's\r\ncharacter. It is sufficient here to say that though Ben's chief defender,\r\nGifford, may have been too hard on Drummond, it is difficult, if not\r\nimpossible, to think that the \"Notes of Conversations\" were made in a\r\nfriendly spirit. They contain for their bulk an extraordinary amount of\r\ninteresting matter, and much sound criticism; but which of us in modern\r\ndays would care to have such \"notes\" taken? A man thinks that there are\r\nfaults in a friend's work, and in the usual exaggeration of conversation he\r\nsays that it is \"rubbish.\" The Drummonds of this world note it down and it\r\npasses as a deliberate judgment. He must be a fortunate man, or an\r\nexceptional recluse, who has not found some good-natured friend anticipate\r\nDrummond, and convey the crude expression (probably heightened in\r\nconveyance) direct to the person concerned. After this visit (which must\r\nhave been at the end of 1618) Jonson suffered the calamity of having his\r\nstudy destroyed by fire, and lost much MS. work. He lived many years longer\r\nand retained his literary primacy, but was unfortunate in money matters,\r\nand even in reception of his work by the public, though the literary men of\r\nhis day made no mistake about him. He died in 1637, and the last of the\r\nmany stories clustering round his name is the famous one of the\r\ninscription, \"O rare Ben Jonson!\" A year later, a _tombeau_, or collection\r\nof funeral poems, entitled _Jonsonus Virbius_, showed the estimate\r\nentertained of him by the best and brightest wits of the time.\r\n\r\nHis life was thus a life of struggle, for he was never rich, and lived for\r\nthe most part on the most unsatisfactory of all sources of income--casual\r\nbounties from the king and others. It is not improbable that his favour\r\nwith the Court and with Templar society (which was then very unpopular with\r\nthe middle classes), had something to do with the ill-reception of his\r\nlater plays. But his literary influence was very great, and with Donne he\r\ndetermined much of the course of English poetry for many years, and\r\nretained a great name even in the comparative eclipse of the \"Giant Race\"\r\nafter the Restoration. It was only when the study of Shakespere became a\r\nfavourite subject with persons of more industry than intelligence in the\r\nearly eighteenth century, that a singular fabric of myth grew up round Ben\r\nJonson. He was pictured as an incarnation of envy, hatred, malice, and all\r\nuncharitableness, directed in the first place towards Shakespere, and then\r\ntowards all other literary craftsmen. William Gifford, his first competent\r\neditor, set himself to work to destroy this, and undoubtedly succeeded. But\r\nthe acrimony with which Gifford tinctured all his literary polemic perhaps\r\nrather injured his treatment of the case; even yet it may be doubted\r\nwhether Ben Jonson has attained anything like his proper place in English\r\nliterary history.\r\n\r\nPutting aside the abiding influence of a good long-continued course of\r\nmisrepresentation, it is still not difficult to discover the source of this\r\nunder-estimate, without admitting the worst view or even any very bad view\r\nof Ben Jonson's character, literary and personal. It may be granted that he\r\nwas rough and arrogant, a scholar who pushed scholarship to the verge of\r\npedantry, a critic who sometimes forgot that though a schoolmaster may be a\r\ncritic, a critic should not be merely a schoolmaster. His work is saturated\r\nwith that contempt of the _profanum vulgus_ which the _profanum vulgus_\r\n(humanly enough) seldom fails to return. Moreover, it is extremely\r\nvoluminous, and it is by no means equal. Of his eighteen plays, three\r\nonly--_Every Man in his Humour_, _The Alchemist_, and the charming fragment\r\nof _The Sad Shepherd_--can be praised as wholes. His lovely _Masques_ are\r\nprobably unread by all but a few scores, if so many, in each generation.\r\nHis noble sinewy prose is, for the most part, unattractive in subject. His\r\nminor poems, though not a few of them are known even to smatterers in\r\nliterature, are as a whole (or at least it would seem so) unknown. Yet his\r\nmerits are extraordinary. \"Never\" in his plays (save _The Sad Shepherd_)\r\n\"tender,\" and still more rarely \"sublime,\" he yet, in words much better\r\napplied to him than to his pupil Dryden, \"wrestles with and conquers time.\"\r\nEven his enemies admit his learning, his vigour, his astonishing power of\r\nwork. What is less generally admitted, despite in one case at least the\r\ncelebrity of the facts that prove it, is his observation, his invention,\r\nand at times his anomalous and seemingly contradictory power of grace and\r\nsweetness. There is no more singular example of the proverb, \"Out of the\r\neater came forth meat, and out of the strong sweetness,\" which has been\r\nhappily applied to Victor Hugo, than the composition, by the rugged author\r\nof _Sejanus_ and _Catiline_, of _The Devil is an Ass_ and _Bartholomew\r\nFair_, of such things as\r\n\r\n    \"Here lies to each her parents ruth;\"\r\n\r\nor the magnificent song,\r\n\r\n    \"Drink to me only with thine eyes;\"\r\n\r\nor the crown and flower of all epitaphs,\r\n\r\n    \"Underneath this sable herse.\"[33]\r\n\r\n[33] Ben is sometimes deprived of this, _me judice_, most irreligiously.\r\n\r\nBut these three universally-known poems only express in quintessence a\r\nquality of Jonson's which is spread all about his minor pieces, which\r\nappears again perfectly in _The Sad Shepherd_, and which he seems to have\r\nkept out of his plays proper rather from bravado than for any other reason.\r\nHis prose will be noticed separately in the next chapter, but it may be\r\nobserved here that it is saturated with the same literary flavour which\r\npervades all his work. None of his dramatic fellows wrote anything that can\r\ncompare to it, just as none of them wrote anything that surpasses the songs\r\nand snatches in his plays, and the best things in his miscellaneous works.\r\nThe one title which no competent criticism has ever grudged him is that of\r\nbest epitaph-writer in the English language, and only those who have failed\r\nto consider the difficulties and the charm of that class of composition\r\nwill consider this faint praise. Nevertheless, it was no doubt upon drama\r\nthat Jonson concentrated his powers, and the unfavourable judgments which\r\nhave been delivered on him chiefly refer to this.\r\n\r\nA good deal of controversy has arisen out of the attribution to him, which\r\nis at least as old as _The Return from Parnassus_, of being minded to\r\nclassicise the English drama. It is certain that he set a value on the\r\nUnities which no other English dramatist has set, and that in _The\r\nAlchemist_ at least he has given something like a perfect example of them,\r\nwhich is at the same time an admirable play. Whether this attention is at\r\nall responsible for the defects which are certainly found in his work is a\r\nvery large question. It cannot be denied that in that work, with perhaps\r\nthe single exception just mentioned, the reader (it is, except in the case\r\nof _Every Man in his Humour_, generations since the playgoer had any\r\nopportunity of judging) finds a certain absence of sympathetic attraction,\r\nas well as, for all the formal unity of the pieces, a lack of that fusing\r\npoetic force which makes detail into a whole. The amazing strength of\r\nJonson's genius, the power with which he has compelled all manner of\r\nunlikely elements into his service, is evident enough, but the result\r\nusually wants charm. The drawbacks are (always excepting _The Alchemist_)\r\nleast perceptible in _Every Man in his Humour_, the first sprightly\r\nrunnings (unless _The Case is Altered_ is older) of Jonson's fancy, the\r\nfreshest example of his sharp observation of \"humours.\" Later he sometimes\r\noverdid this observation, or rather he failed to bring its results\r\nsufficiently into poetic or dramatic form, and, therefore, is too much for\r\nan age and too little for all time. But _Every Man in his Humour_ is really\r\ncharming. Bobadil, Master Stephen, and Kitely attain to the first rank of\r\ndramatic characters, and others are not far behind them in this respect.\r\nThe next play, _Every Man out of his Humour_, is a great contrast, being,\r\nas even the doughty Gifford admits, distinctly uninteresting as a whole,\r\ndespite numerous fine passages. Perhaps a little of its want of attraction\r\nmust be set down to a pestilent habit of Jonson's, which he had at one\r\ntime thought of applying to _Every Man in his Humour_, the habit of giving\r\nforeign, chiefly Italian, appellations to his characters, describing, and\r\nas it were labelling them--Deliro, Macilente, and the like. This gives an\r\nair of unreality, a figurehead and type character. _Cynthia's Revels_ has\r\nthe same defects, but is to some extent saved by its sharp raillery of\r\neuphuism. With _The Poetaster_ Jonson began to rise again. I think myself\r\nthat the personages and machinery of the Augustan Court would be much\r\nbetter away, and that the implied satire on contemporaries would be tedious\r\nif it could not, as it fortunately can, be altogether neglected. But in\r\nspite of these drawbacks, the piece is good. Of _Sejanus_ and Jonson's\r\nlater Roman play _Catiline_ I think, I confess, better than the majority of\r\ncritics appear to think. That they have any very intense tragic interest\r\nwill, indeed, hardly be pretended, and the unfortunate but inevitable\r\ncomparison with _Coriolanus_ and _Julius Caesar_ has done them great and\r\nvery unjust harm. Less human than Shakespere's \"godlike Romans\" (who are as\r\nhuman as they are godlike), Jonson's are undoubtedly more Roman, and this,\r\nif it is not entirely an attraction, is in its way a merit. But it was not\r\ntill after _Sejanus_ that the full power of Jonson appeared. His three next\r\nplays, _Volpone_, _Epicene_, and _The Alchemist_, could not have been\r\nwritten by any one but himself, and, had they not been written, would have\r\nleft a gap in English which nothing from any other literature could supply.\r\nIf his attitude had been a little less virtuous and a little more\r\nsarcastic, Jonson would in these three plays have anticipated Swift. Of the\r\nthree, I prefer the first and the last--the last being the best of all.\r\n_Epicene_ or the _Silent Woman_ was specially liked by the next generation\r\nbecause of its regularity, and of the skill with which the various humours\r\nare all wrought into the main plot. Both these things are undeniable, and\r\nmany of the humours are in themselves amusing enough. But still there is\r\nsomething wanting, which is supplied in _Volpone_ and _The Alchemist_. It\r\nhas been asked whether that disregard of probability, which is one of\r\nJonson's greatest faults, does not appear in the recklessness with which\r\n\"The Fox\" exposes himself to utter ruin, not so much to gratify any sensual\r\ndesire or obtain any material advantage, as simply to indulge his combined\r\nhypocrisy and cynicism to the very utmost. The answer to this question will\r\nvery much depend on each reader's taste and experience. It is undeniable\r\nthat there have been examples of perverse indulgence in wickedness for\r\nwickedness' sake, which, rare as they are, go far to justify the creation\r\nof Volpone. But the unredeemed villany of the hero, with whom it is\r\nimpossible in any way to sympathise, and the sheer brutality of the\r\nfortune-hunting dupes who surround him, make it easier to admire than to\r\nlike the play. I have little doubt that Jonson was to some extent sensible\r\nof this, for the comic episode or underplot of Sir Politick and Lady\r\nWould-be is very much more loosely connected with the centre interest (it\r\nis only by courtesy that it can be said to be connected at all), than is\r\nusual with him, and this is an argument in favour of its having been\r\nintroduced as a makeweight.\r\n\r\nFrom the drawbacks of both these pieces _The Alchemist_ is wholly free.\r\nJonson here escaped his usual pitfall of the unsympathetic, for the vices\r\nand follies he satirises are not loathsome, only contemptible at worst, and\r\nnot always that. He found an opportunity of exercising his extraordinary\r\nfaculty of concentration as he nowhere else did, and has given us in Sir\r\nEpicure Mammon a really magnificent picture of concupiscence, of sensual\r\nappetite generally, sublimed by heat of imagination into something really\r\npoetic. The triumvirate of adventurers, Subtle, Dol and Face (for Dol has\r\nvirile qualities), are not respectable, but one does not hate them; and the\r\ngulls are perfection. If any character could be spared it is the \"Angry\r\nBoy,\" a young person whose humours, as Jonson himself admits of another\r\ncharacter elsewhere, are \"more tedious than diverting.\" _The Alchemist_ was\r\nfollowed by _Catiline_, and _Catiline_ by _Bartholomew Fair_, a play in\r\nwhich singularly vivid and minute pictures of manners, very amusing\r\nsketches of character, and some capital satire on the Puritans, do not\r\nentirely redeem a profusion of the coarsest possible language and incident.\r\n_The Devil is an Ass_ comes next in time, and though no single character is\r\nthe equal of Zeal-of-the-land Busy in _Bartholomew Fair_, the play is even\r\nmore amusing. The four last plays, _The Staple of News_, _The Magnetic\r\nLady_, _The New Inn_, and _The Tale of a Tub_, which Jonson produced after\r\nlong absence from the stage, were not successful, and were both unkindly\r\nand unjustly called by Dryden \"Ben's dotages.\" As for the charming _Sad\r\nShepherd_, it was never acted, and is now unfinished, though it is believed\r\nthat the poet completed it. It stands midway as a pastoral _Feerie_ between\r\nhis regular plays and the great collection of ingenious and graceful\r\nmasques and entertainments, which are at the top of all such things in\r\nEngland (unless _Comus_ be called a masque), and which are worth comparing\r\nwith the ballets and spectacle pieces of Moliere. Perhaps a complete survey\r\nof Jonson's work indicates, as his greatest defect, the want of passion. He\r\ncould be vigorous, he could be dignified, he could be broadly humorous,\r\nand, as has been said, he could combine with these the apparently\r\nincompatible, or, at least, not closely-connected faculty of grace. Of\r\npassion, of rapture, there is no trace in him, except in the single\r\ninstance--in fire mingled with earth--of Sir Epicure Mammon. But the two\r\nfollowing passages--one from _Sejanus_, one from _The Sad Shepherd_--will\r\nshow his dignity and his pathos. No extract in brief could show his\r\nhumour:--\r\n\r\n    _Arr._ \"I would begin to study 'em,[34] if I thought\r\n           They would secure me. May I pray to Jove\r\n           In secret and be safe? ay, or aloud,\r\n           With open wishes, so I do not mention\r\n           Tiberius or Sejanus? Yes I must,\r\n           If I speak out. 'Tis hard that. May I think\r\n           And not be racked? What danger is't to dream,\r\n           Talk in one's sleep or cough? Who knows the laws?\r\n           May I shake my head without a comment? Say\r\n           It rains, or it holds up, and not be thrown\r\n           Upon the Gemonies?

Nor is now the event\r\n           Of any person, or for any crime\r\n           To be expected; for 'tis always one:\r\n           Death, with some little difference of place\r\n           Or time.

The translator of Homer was a good deal older than Jonson, and\r\nexceedingly little is known of his life. He was pretty certainly born near\r\nHitchin in Hertfordshire, the striking situation of which points his\r\nreference to it even in these railroad days. The date is uncertain--it may\r\nhave been 1557, and was certainly not later than 1559--so that he was the\r\noldest of the later Elizabethan school who survived into the Caroline\r\nperiod. He perhaps entered the University of Oxford in 1574. His first\r\nknown work, _The Shadow of Night_, dates from 1594; and a reference of\r\nMeres's shows that he was known for tragedy four years later. In 1613 he,\r\nJonson (a constant friend of his whose mutual fidelity refutes of itself\r\nthe silly calumnies as to Jonson's enviousness, for of Chapman only, among\r\nhis colleagues, was he likely to be jealous), and Marston were partners in\r\nthe venture of _Eastward Ho!_ which, for some real or fancied slight on\r\nScotland, exposed the authors to danger of the law. He was certainly a\r\n_protege_ of Prince Henry, the English Marcellus, and he seems to have\r\nreceived patronage from a much less blameless patron, Carr, Earl of\r\nSomerset. His literary activity was continuous and equal, but it was in his\r\nlater days that he attempted and won the crown of the greatest of English\r\ntranslators. \"Georgius Chapmannus, Homeri metaphrastes\" the posy of his\r\nportrait runs, and he himself seems to have quite sunk any expectation of\r\nfame from his original work in the expectation of remembrance as a\r\ntranslator of the Prince of Poets. Many other interesting traits suggest,\r\nrather than ascertain, themselves in reference to him, such as his possible\r\nconnection with the early despatch of English troupes of players to\r\nGermany, and his adoption of contemporary French subjects for English\r\ntragedy. But of certain knowledge of him we have very little. What is\r\ncertain is that, like Drayton (also a friend of his), he seems to have\r\nlived remote and afar from the miserable quarrels and jealousies of his\r\ntime; that, as has been already shown by dates, he was a kind of English\r\nFontenelle in his overlapping of both ends of the great school of English\r\npoets; and that absolutely no base personal gossip tarnishes his poetical\r\nfame. The splendid sonnet of Keats testifies to the influence which his\r\nwork long had on those Englishmen who were unable to read Homer in the\r\noriginal. A fine essay of Mr. Swinburne's has done, for the first time,\r\njustice to his general literary powers, and a very ingenious and, among\r\nsuch hazardous things, unusually probable conjecture of Mr. Minto's\r\nidentifies him with the \"rival poet\" of Shakespere's _Sonnets_. But these\r\nare adventitious claims to fame. What is not subject to such deduction is\r\nthe assertion that Chapman was a great Englishman who, while exemplifying\r\nthe traditional claim of great Englishmen to originality, independence,\r\nand versatility of work, escaped at once the English tendency to lack of\r\nscholarship, and to ignorance of contemporary continental achievements, was\r\nentirely free from the fatal Philistinism in taste and in politics, and in\r\nother matters, which has been the curse of our race, was a Royalist, a\r\nlover, a scholar, and has left us at once one of the most voluminous and\r\npeculiar collections of work that stand to the credit of any literary man\r\nof his country. It may be that his memory has gained by escaping the danger\r\nof such revelations or scandals as the Jonson confessions to Drummond, and\r\nthat the lack of attraction to the ordinary reader in his work has saved\r\nhim from that comparison which (it has perhaps been urged _ad nauseam_) is\r\nthe bane of just literary judgment. To those who always strive to waive all\r\nsuch considerations, these things will make but little difference.\r\n\r\nThe only complete edition of Chapman's works dates from our own days, and\r\nits three volumes correspond to a real division of subject. Although, in\r\ncommon with all these writers, Chapman has had much uncertain and some\r\nimprobable work fathered on him, his certain dramas supply one of the most\r\ninteresting studies in our period. As usual with everyone except Shakespere\r\nand (it is a fair reason for the relatively disproportionate estimate of\r\nthese so long held) Beaumont and Fletcher, they are extremely unequal. Not\r\na certain work of Chapman is void of interest. The famous _Eastward Ho!_\r\n(one of the liveliest comedies of the period dealing with London life) was\r\nthe work of three great writers, and it is not easy to distribute its\r\ncollaboration. That it is not swamped with \"humours\" may prove that\r\nJonson's learned sock was put on by others. That it is neither grossly\r\nindecent nor extravagantly sanguinary, shows that Marston had not the chief\r\nhand in it, and so we are left to Chapman. What he could do is not shown in\r\nthe list of his own certain plays till _All Fools_. _The Blind Beggar of\r\nAlexandria_ (1596?) and _An Humorous Day's Mirth_ show that singular\r\npromiscuousness--that heaping together of scenes without order or\r\nconnection--which we have noticed in the first dramatic period, not to\r\nmention that the way in which the characters speak of themselves, not as\r\n\"I\" but by their names in the third person, is also unmistakable. But _All\r\nFools_ is a much more noteworthy piece, and though Mr. Swinburne may have\r\npraised it rather highly, it would certainly take place in a collection of\r\nthe score best comedies of the time not written by Shakespere. _The\r\nGentleman Usher_ and _Monsieur d'Olive_ belong to the same school of\r\nhumorous, not too pedantic comedy, and then we come to the strange series\r\nof Chapman's French tragedies, _Bussy d'Ambois_, _The Revenge of Bussy\r\nd'Ambois_, _Byron's Conspiracy_, _The Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron_,\r\nand _The Tragedy of Philip Chabot, Admiral of France_. These singular plays\r\nstand by themselves. Whether the strong influence which Marlowe exercised\r\non Chapman led the later poet (who it must be remembered was not the\r\nyounger) to continue _The Massacre of Paris_, or what other cause begat\r\nthem, cannot now be asserted or even guessed without lost labour. A famous\r\ncriticism of Dryden's attests his attention to them, but does not, perhaps,\r\nto those who have studied Dryden deeply, quite express the influence which\r\nChapman had on the leader of post-Restoration tragedy. As plays, the whole\r\nfive are models of what plays should not be; in parts, they are models of\r\nwhat plays should be. Then Chapman returned to the humour-comedy and\r\nproduced two capital specimens of it in _May-Day_ and _The Widow's Tears_.\r\n_Alphonsus, Emperor of Germany_, which contains long passages of German,\r\nand _Revenge for Honour_, two tragedies which were not published till long\r\nafter Chapman's death, are to my mind very dubiously his. Mr. Swinburne, in\r\ndealing with them, availed himself of the hypothesis of a mellowing, but at\r\nthe same time weakening of power by age. It may be so, and I have not the\r\nslightest intention of pronouncing decidedly on the subject. They bear to\r\nmy mind much more mark of the decadent period of Charles I., when the\r\nsecret of blank verse was for a time lost, and when even men who had lived\r\nin personal friendship with their great predecessors lapsed into the\r\nslipshod stuff that we find in Davenant, in his followers, and among them\r\neven in the earlier plays of Dryden. It is, of course, true that this\r\nloosening and slackening of the standard betrays itself even before the\r\ndeath of Chapman, which happened in 1634. But I cannot believe that the\r\nauthor of _Bussy d'Ambois_ (where the verse is rude enough but never lax)\r\nand the contemporary or elder of Shakespere, Marlowe, and all the great\r\nrace, could ever have been guilty of the slovenliness which, throughout,\r\nmarks _Revenge for Honour_.\r\n\r\nThe second part of Chapman's work, his original verse, is much inferior in\r\nbulk and in interest of matter to the first and third. Yet, is it not\r\nperhaps inferior to either in giving evidence of the author's\r\npeculiarities; while the very best thing he ever wrote (a magnificent\r\npassage in _The Tears of Peace_) is contained in it. Its component parts\r\nare, however, sufficiently odd. It opens with a strange poem called _The\r\nShadow of Night_, which Mr. Swinburne is not wrong in classing among the\r\nobscurest works in English. The mischievous fashion of enigmatic writing,\r\nalready glanced at in the section on satire, was perhaps an offshoot of\r\neuphuism; and certainly Chapman, who never exhibits much taint of euphuism\r\nproper, here out-Herods Herod and out-Tourneurs Tourneur. It was followed\r\nby an equally singular attempt at the luscious school of which _Venus and\r\nAdonis_ is the most famous. _Ovid's Banquet of Sense_ has received high\r\npraise from critics whom I esteem. For my own part I should say that it is\r\nthe most curious instance of a radically unpassionate nature, trying to\r\nlash itself into passion, that our language contains. Then Chapman tried an\r\neven bolder flight in the same dialect--the continuation of Marlowe's\r\nunfinished _Hero and Leander_. In this attempt, either by sheer force of\r\nhis sinewy athletics, or by some inspiration derived from the \"Dead\r\nShepherd,\" his predecessor, he did not fail, curious as is the contrast of\r\nthe two parts. _The Tears of Peace_, which contains his finest work, is in\r\nhonour of Prince Henry--a worthy work on a worthy subject, which was\r\nfollowed up later by an epicedium on the prince's lamented death. Besides\r\nsome epigrams and sonnets, the chief other piece of this division is the\r\ndisastrous _Andromeda Liberata_, which unluckily celebrates the\r\nnuptials--stained with murder, adultery, and crime of all sorts--of Frances\r\nHoward and Robert Carr. It is in Chapman's most allusive and thorniest\r\nstyle, but is less interesting intrinsically than as having given occasion\r\nto an indignant prose vindication by the poet, which, considering his\r\nself-evident honesty, is the most valuable document in existence for\r\nexplaining the apparently grovelling panegyric of the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth century. It makes clear (what indeed an intelligent reader\r\nmight gather for himself) that the traditional respect for rank and\r\nstation, uniting with the tendency to look for patterns and precedents in\r\nthe classics for almost everything, made of these panegyrics a kind of\r\nschool exercise, in which the excellence of the subject was taken for\r\ngranted, and the utmost hyperbole of praise was only a \"common form\" of\r\ncomposition, to which the poet imparted or added what grace of style or\r\nfancy he could, with hardly a notion of his ascriptions being taken\r\nliterally.\r\n\r\nBut if Chapman's dramas have been greatly undervalued, and if his original\r\npoems are an invaluable help to the study of the time, there is no doubt\r\nthat it is as a translator that he made and kept the strongest hold on the\r\nEnglish mind. He himself spoke of his Homeric translations (which he began\r\nas early as 1598, doing also Hesiod, some Juvenal, and some minor\r\nfragments, Pseudo-Virgilian, Petrarchian and others) as \"the work that he\r\nwas born to do.\" His version, with all its faults, outlived the popularity\r\neven of Pope, was for more than two centuries the resort of all who, unable\r\nto read Greek, wished to know what the Greek was, and, despite the finical\r\nscholarship of the present day, is likely to survive all the attempts made\r\nwith us. I speak with all humility, but as having learnt Homer from Homer\r\nhimself, and not from any translation, prose or verse. I am perfectly aware\r\nof Chapman's outrageous liberties, of his occasional unfaithfulness (for a\r\nlibertine need not necessarily be unfaithful in translation), and of the\r\ncondescension to his own fancies and the fancies of his age, which obscures\r\nnot more perhaps than some condescensions which nearness and contemporary\r\ninfluences prevent some of us from seeing the character of the original.\r\nBut at the same time, either I have no skill in criticism, and have been\r\nreading Greek for fifty years to none effect, or Chapman is far nearer\r\nHomer than any modern translator in any modern language. He is nearer in\r\nthe Iliad than in the Odyssey--an advantage resulting from his choice of\r\nvehicle. In the Odyssey he chose the heroic couplet, which never can give\r\nthe rise and fall of the hexameter. In the Iliad, after some hesitation\r\nbetween the two (he began as early as 1598), he preferred the fourteener,\r\nwhich, at its best, is the hexameter's nearest substitute. With Chapman it\r\nis not always at its best--very far from it. If he never quite relapses\r\ninto the sheer doggerel of the First Period, he sometimes comes perilously\r\nnear to it. But he constantly lifts his wings and soars in a quite\r\ndifferent measure which, when he keeps it up for a little, gives a\r\nnarrative vehicle unsurpassed, and hardly equalled, in English poetry for\r\nvariation of movement and steady forward flow combined. The one point in\r\nwhich the Homeric hexameter is unmatched among metres is its combination of\r\nsteady advance with innumerable ripples and eddies in its course, and it is\r\nhere that Chapman (though of course not fully) can partly match it. It is,\r\nhowever, one of the testimonies to the supreme merit of the Homeric poems\r\nthat every age seems to try to imitate them in its own special mannerisms,\r\nand that, consequently, no age is satisfied with the attempts of another.\r\nIt is a second, that those who know the original demur at all.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of Chapman, then, are very much those of Jonson with a\r\ndifference. Both had the same incapacity of unlaboured and forceless art,\r\nthe same insensibility to passion, the same inability to rise above mere\r\nhumours and contemporary oddities into the region of universal poetry. Both\r\nhad the same extensive learning, the same immense energy, the same (if it\r\nmust be said) arrogance and contempt of the vulgar. In casual strokes,\r\nthough not in sustained grasp, Chapman was Jonson's superior; but unlike\r\nJonson he had no lyric gift, and unlike Jonson he let his learning and his\r\nambitious thought clog and obscure the flow of his English. Nor does he\r\nshow in any of his original work the creative force of his younger friend.\r\nWith the highest opinion reasonably possible of Chapman's dramas, we cannot\r\nimagine him for a moment composing a _Volpone_ or an _Alchemist_--even a\r\n_Bartholomew Fair_; while he was equally, or still more, incapable of\r\nJonson's triumphs in epigram and epitaph, in song and ode. A certain\r\nshapelessness is characteristic of everything that Chapman did--an\r\ninability, as Mr. Swinburne (to whom every one who now writes on Chapman\r\nmust acknowledge indebtedness), has said, \"to clear his mouth of pebbles,\r\nand his brow of fog.\" His long literary life, which must have exceeded half\r\na century, and his great learning, forbid our setting this down as it may\r\nbe set in the case of many of his contemporaries, and especially in the\r\ncase of those two to whom we are now coming, as due to youth, to the\r\nimperfect state of surrounding culture, to want of time for perfecting his\r\nwork, and so forth. He is the \"Begue de Vilaines,\" the heroic Stammerer of\r\nEnglish literature--a man who evidently had some congenital defect which\r\nall his fire and force, all his care and curiosity, could not overcome. Yet\r\nare his doings great, and it is at least probable that if he had felt less\r\ndifficulty in original work, he would not have been prompted to set about\r\nand finish the noble work of translation which is among the best products\r\nof an unsatisfactory kind, and which will outlive the cavils of generations\r\nof etymologists and aorist-grinders. He has been so little read that four\r\nspecimens of his different manners--the early \"tenebrous\" style of _The\r\nShadow of Night_, the famous passage from _Bussy d'Ambois_ which excited\r\nLamb's enthusiasm, and a sample from both _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_--may be\r\ngiven:\r\n\r\n    \"In this vast thicket (whose description's task\r\n    The pens of fairies and of fiends would ask:\r\n    So more than human-thoughted horrible)\r\n    The souls of such as lived implausible,\r\n    In happy empire of this goddess' glories,\r\n    And scorned to crown her fanes with sacrifice,[35]\r\n    Did ceaseless walk; exspiring fearful groans,\r\n    Curses and threats for their confusions.\r\n    Her darts, and arrows, some of them had slain:\r\n    Others her dogs eat, painting her disdain,\r\n    After she had transformed them into beasts:\r\n    Others her monsters carried to their nests,\r\n    Rent them in pieces, and their spirits sent\r\n    To this blind shade, to wail their banishment.\r\n    The huntsmen hearing (since they could not hear)\r\n    Their hounds at fault, in eager chase drew near,\r\n    Mounted on lions, unicorns, and boars,\r\n    And saw their hounds lie licking of their sores\r\n    Some yearning at the shroud, as if they chid\r\n    Her stinging tongues, that did their chase forbid:\r\n    By which they knew the game was that way gone.\r\n    Then each man forced the beast he rode upon,\r\n    T' assault the thicket; whose repulsive thorns\r\n    So gall'd the lions, boars, and unicorns,\r\n    Dragons and wolves, that half their courages\r\n    Were spent in roars, and sounds of heaviness:\r\n    Yet being the princeliest, and hardiest beasts,\r\n    That gave chief fame to those Ortygian forests,\r\n    And all their riders furious of their sport,\r\n    A fresh assault they gave, in desperate sort:\r\n    And with their falchions made their way in wounds,\r\n    The thicket open'd, and let in the hounds.\"\r\n\r\n[35] The rhyme, bad as it is, is not unprecedented.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Bu._ \"What dismal change is here; the good old Friar\r\n          Is murther'd, being made known to serve my love;\r\n          And now his restless spirit would forewarn me\r\n          Of some plot dangerous and imminent.\r\n          Note what he wants?

The uncouthness, as well as the suspicion of insincerity, which we\r\nnoted in his satirical work, extend, as it seems to me, also to his dramas;\r\nand if we class him as a worker in horrors with Marlowe earlier, and with\r\nWebster and Ford later, the chief result will be to show his extreme\r\ninferiority to them. He is even below Tourneur in this respect, while, like\r\nTourneur, he is exposed to the charge of utterly neglecting congruity and\r\nproportion. With him we relapse not merely from the luminous perfection of\r\nShakespere, from the sane order of work which was continued through\r\nFletcher, and the best of Fletcher's followers, but from the more\r\nartificial unity of Jonson, back into the chaotic extravagances of the\r\nFirst Period. Marston, like the rest, is fond of laughing at _Jeronimo_,\r\nbut his own tragic construction and some of his own tragic scenes are\r\nhardly less bombastic, and scarcely at all less promiscuous than the\r\ntangled horrors of that famous melodrama. Marston, it is true, has lucid\r\nintervals--even many of them. Hazlitt has succeeded in quoting many\r\nbeautiful passages, one of which was curiously echoed in the next age by\r\nNat. Lee, in whom, indeed, there was a strong vein of Elizabethan\r\nmelodrama. The sarcasm on philosophical study in _What You Will_ is one of\r\nthe very best things of its own kind in the range of English drama,--light,\r\nsustained, not too long nor too short, in fact, thoroughly \"hit off.\"\r\n\r\n    \"_Delight_ my spaniel slept, whilst I baused[37] leaves,\r\n    Tossed o'er the dunces, pored on the old print\r\n    Of titled words, and still my spaniel slept.\r\n    Whilst I wasted lamp oil, bated my flesh,\r\n    Shrunk up my veins, and still my spaniel slept,\r\n    And still I held converse with Zabarell,\r\n    Aquinas, Scotus, and the musty saws\r\n    Of antique Donate: still my spaniel slept.\r\n    Still on went I: first _an sit anima_,\r\n    Then, an' 'twere mortal. O hold, hold!\r\n    At that they are at brain buffets, fell by the ears,\r\n    Amain [pell-mell] together--still my spaniel slept.\r\n    Then whether 'twere corporeal, local, fixed,\r\n    _Ex traduce_; but whether 't had free will\r\n    Or no, hot philosophers\r\n    Stood banding factions all so strongly propped,\r\n    I staggered, knew not which was firmer part;\r\n    But thought, quoted, read, observed and pried,\r\n    Stuffed noting-books, and still my spaniel slept.\r\n    At length he waked and yawned, and by yon sky\r\n    For aught I know, he knew as much as I.\"\r\n\r\n[37] Kissed.\r\n\r\nThere is real pathos in _Antonio and Mellida_, and real satire in\r\n_Parasitaster_ and _The Malcontent_. Hazlitt (who had a very high opinion\r\nof Marston) admits that the remarkable inequalities of this last piece\r\n\"seem to show want of interest in the subject.\" This is an odd explanation,\r\nbut I suspect it is really only an anticipation in more favourable words of\r\nmy own theory, that Marston's tragic and satiric moods were not really\r\nsincere; that he was a clever man who found a fashion of satire and a\r\nfashion of blood-and-thunder tragedy prevailing, and threw himself into\r\nboth without much or any heart in the matter. This is supported by the\r\ncurious fact that almost all his plays (at least those extant) were\r\nproduced within a very few years, 1602-1607, though he lived some thirty\r\nyears after the latter date, and quite twenty after his last dated\r\nappearances in literature, _The Insatiate Countess_, and _Eastward Ho!_\r\nThat he was an ill-tempered person with considerable talents, who\r\nsucceeded, at any rate for a time, in mistaking his ill-temper for _saeva\r\nindignatio_, and his talents for genius, is not, I think, too harsh a\r\ndescription of Marston. In the hotbed of the literary influences of the\r\ntime these conditions of his produced some remarkable fruit. But when the\r\nlate Professor Minto attributes to him \"amazing and almost Titanic energy,\"\r\nmentions \"life\" several times over as one of the chief characteristics of\r\nhis personages (I should say that they had as much life as violently-moved\r\nmarionettes), and discovers \"amiable and admirable characters\" among them,\r\nI am compelled not, of course, to be positive that my own very different\r\nestimate is right, but to wonder at the singularly different way in which\r\nthe same things strike different persons, who are not as a rule likely to\r\nlook at them from very different points of view.\r\n\r\nMarston's plays, however, are both powerful enough and famous enough to\r\ncall for a somewhat more detailed notice. _Antonio and Mellida_, the\r\nearliest and if not the best as a whole, that which contains the finest\r\nscenes and fragments, is in two parts--the second being more properly\r\ncalled _The Revenge of Antonio_. The revenge itself is of the exaggerated\r\ncharacter which was so popular with the Elizabethan dramatists, but in\r\nwhich (except in the famous Cornwall and Gloucester scene in _Lear_)\r\nShakespere never indulged after his earliest days. The wicked tyrant's\r\ntongue is torn out, his murdered son's body is thrown down before him, and\r\nthen the conspirators, standing round, gibe, curse, and rant at him for a\r\ncouple of pages before they plunge their swords into his body. This goodly\r\nconclusion is led up to by a sufficient quantity of antecedent and casual\r\ncrimes, together with much not very excellent fooling by a court gull,\r\nBalurdo, who might be compared with Shakespere's fools of the same kind, to\r\nthe very great advantage of those who do not appreciate the latter. The\r\nbeautiful descriptive and reflective passages which, in Lamb's _Extracts_,\r\ngave the play its reputation, chiefly occur towards the beginning, and this\r\nis the best of them:--\r\n\r\n    _And._ \"Why man, I never was a Prince till now.\r\n           'Tis not the bared pate, the bended knees,\r\n           Gilt tipstaves, Tyrian purple, chairs of state,\r\n           Troops of pied butterflies, that flutter still\r\n           In greatness summer, that confirm a prince:\r\n           'Tis not the unsavoury breath of multitudes,\r\n           Shouting and clapping, with confused din;\r\n           That makes a prince. No, Lucio, he's a king,\r\n           A true right king, that dares do aught save wrong,\r\n           Fears nothing mortal, but to be unjust,\r\n           Who is not blown up with the flattering puffs\r\n           Of spungy sycophants: who stands unmov'd\r\n           Despite the jostling of opinion:\r\n           Who can enjoy himself, maugre the throng\r\n           That strive to press his quiet out of him:\r\n           Who sits upon Jove's footstool as I do\r\n           Adoring, not affecting majesty:\r\n           Whose brow is wreathed with the silver crown\r\n           Of clear content: this, Lucio, is a king,\r\n           And of this empire, every man's possessed\r\n           That's worth his soul.\"\r\n\r\n_Sophonisba_, which followed, is much less rambling, but as bloody and\r\nextravagant. The scene where the witch Erichtho plays Succubus to Syphax,\r\ninstead of the heroine, and in her form, has touches which partly, but not\r\nwholly, redeem its extravagance, and the end is dignified and good. _What\r\nYou Will_, a comedy of intrigue, is necessarily free from Marston's worst\r\nfaults, and here the admirable passage quoted above occurs. But the main\r\nplot--which turns not only on the courtship, by a mere fribble, of a lady\r\nwhose husband is supposed to be dead, and who has very complacently\r\nforgotten all about him, but on a ridiculous plot to foist a pretender off\r\nas the dead husband itself--is simply absurd. The lack of probability,\r\nwhich is the curse of the minor Elizabethan drama, hardly anywhere appears\r\nmore glaringly. _Parasitaster_, or _The Fawn_, a satirical comedy, is much\r\nbetter, but the jealous hatred of _The Dutch Courtesan_ is again not made\r\nprobable. Then came Marston's completest work in drama, _The Malcontent_,\r\nan anticipation, after Elizabethan fashion, of _Le Misanthrope_ and _The\r\nPlain Dealer_. Though not free from Marston's two chief vices of coarseness\r\nand exaggerated cynicism, it is a play of great merit, and much the best\r\nthing he has done, though the reconciliation, at the end, of such a\r\nhusband and such a wife as Piero and Aurelia, between whom there is a chasm\r\nof adultery and murder, again lacks verisimilitude. It is to be observed\r\nthat both in _The Fawn_ and _The Malcontent_ there are disguised dukes--a\r\nfact not testifying any very great originality, even in borrowing. Of\r\n_Eastward Ho!_ we have already spoken, and it is by no means certain that\r\n_The Insatiate Countess_ is Marston's. His reputation would not lose much\r\nwere it not. A _fabliau_-like underplot of the machinations of two\r\nlight-o'-love citizens' wives against their husbands is not unamusing, but\r\nthe main story of the Countess Isabella, a modern Messalina (except that\r\nshe adds cruelty to the vices of Messalina) who alternately courts lovers\r\nand induces their successors to assassinate them, is in the worst style of\r\nthe whole time--the tragedy of lust that is not dignified by the slightest\r\npassion, and of murder that is not excused by the slightest poetry of\r\nmotive or treatment. Though the writing is not of the lowest order, it\r\nmight have been composed by any one of some thirty or forty writers. It was\r\nactually attributed at the time to William Barksted, a minor poet of some\r\npower, and I am inclined to think it not Marston's, though my own estimate\r\nof him is, as will have been seen, not so high as some other estimates. It\r\nis because those estimates appear to me unduly high that I have rather\r\naccentuated the expression of my own lower one. For the last century, and\r\nperhaps longer, the language of hyperbole has been but too common about our\r\ndramatists, and I have known more than one case in which the extravagant\r\npraise bestowed upon them has, when students have come to the works\r\nthemselves, had a very disastrous effect of disappointment. It is,\r\ntherefore, all the more necessary to be candid in criticism where criticism\r\nseems to be required.\r\n\r\nAs to the last of our good company, there is fortunately very little risk\r\nof difference of opinion. A hundred years ago Thomas Dekker was probably\r\nlittle more than a name to all but professed students of Elizabethan\r\nliterature, and he waited longer than any of his fellows for due\r\nrecognition by presentation of his work in a complete form. It was not\r\nuntil the year 1873 that his plays were collected; it was not till eleven\r\nyears later that his prose works had the same honour. Yet, since attention\r\nwas directed to Dekker in any way, the best authorities have been unanimous\r\nin his praise. Lamb's famous outburst of enthusiasm, that he had \"poetry\r\nenough for anything,\" has been soberly endorsed by two full generations of\r\nthe best judges, and whatever differences of detail there may be as to his\r\nwork, it is becoming more and more the received, and correctly-received\r\nopinion, that, as his collaborator Webster came nearest to Shakespere in\r\nuniversalising certain types in the severer tragedy, so Dekker has the same\r\nhonour on the gently pathetic side. Yet this great honour is done to one of\r\nthe most shadowy personalities in literature. We have four goodly volumes\r\nof his plays and five of his other works; yet of Thomas Dekker, the man, we\r\nknow absolutely less than of any one of his shadowy fellows. We do not know\r\nwhen he was born, when he died, what he did other than writing in the\r\ncertainly long space between the two unknown dates. In 1637 he was by his\r\nown words a man of threescore, which, as it has been justly remarked, may\r\nmean anything between fifty-five and seventy. He was in circumstances a\r\ncomplete contrast to his fellow-victim in Jonson's satire, Marston. Marston\r\nwas apparently a gentleman born and bred, well connected, well educated,\r\npossessed of some property, able to make testamentary dispositions, and\r\nprobably in the latter part of his life, when Dekker was still toiling at\r\njournalism of various kinds, a beneficed clergyman in country retirement.\r\nDekker was, it is to be feared, what the arrogance of certain members of\r\nthe literary profession has called, and calls, a gutter-journalist--a man\r\nwho had no regular preparation for the literary career, and who never\r\nproduced anything but hand-to-mouth work. Jonson went so far as to say that\r\nhe was a \"rogue;\" but Ben, though certainly not a rogue, was himself not to\r\nbe trusted when he spoke of people that he did not like; and if there was\r\nany but innocent roguery in Dekker he has contrived to leave exactly the\r\nopposite impression stamped on every piece of his work. And it is\r\nparticularly interesting to note, that constantly as he wrote in\r\ncollaboration, one invariable tone, and that the same as is to be found in\r\nhis undoubtedly independent work, appears alike in plays signed with him by\r\npersons so different as Middleton and Webster, as Chettle and Ford. When\r\nthis is the case, the inference is certain, according to the strictest\r\nrules of logic. We can define Dekker's idiosyncrasy almost more certainly\r\nthan if he had never written a line except under his own name. That\r\nidiosyncrasy consists, first, of an exquisite lyrical faculty, which, in\r\nthe songs given in all collections of extracts, equals, or almost equals,\r\nthat of Shakespere; secondly, of a faculty for poetical comedy, for the\r\ncomedy which transcends and plays with, rather than grasps and exposes, the\r\nvices and follies of men; thirdly, for a touch of pathos again to be evened\r\nonly to Shakespere's; and lastly, for a knack of representing women's\r\nnature, for which, except in the master of all, we may look in vain\r\nthroughout the plentiful dramatic literature of the period, though touches\r\nof it appear in Greene's Margaret of Fressingfield, in Heywood, in\r\nMiddleton, and in some of the anonymous plays which have been fathered\r\nindifferently, and with indifferent hopelessness of identification, on some\r\nof the greatest of names of the period, on some of the meanest, and on an\r\nequal number of those that are neither great nor mean.\r\n\r\nDekker's very interesting prose works we shall treat in the next chapter,\r\ntogether with the other tracts into whose class they fall, and some of his\r\nplays may either go unnoticed, or, with those of the dramatists who\r\ncollaborated with him, and whose (notably in the case of _The Roaring\r\nGirl_) they pretty evidently were more than his. His own characteristic\r\npieces, or those in which his touch shows most clearly, though they may not\r\nbe his entirely, are _The Shoemaker's Holiday_, _Old Fortunatus_,\r\n_Satiromastix_, _Patient Grissil_, _The Honest Whore_, _The Whore of\r\nBabylon_, _If it be not Good the Devil is in it_, _The Virgin Martyr_,\r\n_Match me in London_, _The Son's Darling_, and _The Witch of Edmonton_. In\r\neveryone of these the same characteristics appear, but the strangely\r\ncomposite fashion of writing of the time makes them appear in differing\r\nmeasures. _The Shoemaker's Holiday_ is one of those innumerable and yet\r\nsingular pieces in which the taste of the time seems to have so much\r\ndelighted, and which seem so odd to modern taste,--pieces in which a plot\r\nor underplot, as the case may be, of the purest comedy of manners, a mere\r\npicture of the life, generally the lower middle-class life of the time, is\r\nunited with hardly a thought of real dramatic conjunction to another plot\r\nof a romantic kind, in which noble and royal personages, with, it may be, a\r\ndash of history, play their parts. The crowning instance of this is\r\nMiddleton's _Mayor of Queenborough_; but there are scores and hundreds of\r\nothers, and Dekker specially affects it. _The Shoemaker's Holiday_ is\r\nprincipally distinguished by the directness and raciness of its citizen\r\nsketches. _Satiromastix_ (the second title of which is \"The Untrussing of\r\nthe Humorous Poet\") is Dekker's reply to _The Poetaster_, in which he\r\nendeavours to retort Jonson's own machinery upon him. With his customary\r\ndisregard of congruity, however, he has mixed up the personages of Horace,\r\nCrispinus, Demetrius, and Tucca, not with a Roman setting, but with a\r\npurely romantic story of William Rufus and Sir Walter Tyrrel, and the\r\nking's attempt upon the fidelity of Tyrrel's bride. This incongruous\r\nmixture gives one of the most charming scenes of his pen, the apparent\r\npoisoning of Celestina by her father to save her honour. But as Lamb\r\nhimself candidly confessed, the effect of this in the original is marred,\r\nif not ruined, by the farcical surroundings, and the more farcical upshot\r\nof the scene itself,--the poisoning being, like Juliet's, a mere trick,\r\nthough very differently fortuned. In _Patient Grissil_ the two exquisite\r\nsongs, \"Art thou poor\" and \"Golden slumbers kiss thine eyes,\" and the\r\nsympathetic handling of Griselda's character (the one of all others to\r\nappeal to Dekker) mark his work. In all the other plays the same notes\r\nappear, and there is no doubt that Mr. Swinburne is wholly right in\r\nsingling out from _The Witch of Edmonton_ the feminine characters of Susan,\r\nWinifred, and the witch herself, as showing Dekker's unmatched command of\r\nthe colours in which to paint womanhood. In the great debate as to the\r\nauthorship of _The Virgin Martyr_, everything is so much conjecture that it\r\nis hard to pronounce authoritatively. Gifford's cool assumption that\r\neverything bad in the play is Dekker's, and everything good Massinger's,\r\nwill not hold for a moment; but, on the other side, it must be remembered\r\nthat since Lamb there has been a distinct tendency to depreciate Massinger.\r\nAll that can be said is, that the grace and tenderness of the Virgin's part\r\nare much more in accordance with what is certainly Dekker's than with what\r\nis certainly Massinger's, and that either was quite capable of the Hircius\r\nand Spungius passages which have excited so much disgust and\r\nindignation--disgust and indignation which perhaps overlook the fact that\r\nthey were no doubt inserted with the express purpose of heightening, by\r\nhowever clumsily designed a contrast, the virgin purity of Dorothea the\r\nsaint.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that I have reserved _Old Fortunatus_ and _The Honest\r\nWhore_ for separate notice. They illustrate, respectively, the power which\r\nDekker has in romantic poetry, and his command of vivid, tender, and subtle\r\nportraiture in the characters, especially, of women. Both, and especially\r\nthe earlier play, exhibit also his rapid careless writing, and his\r\nignorance of, or indifference to, the construction of a clear and\r\ndistinctly outlined plot. _Old Fortunatus_ tells the well-known story of\r\nthe wishing cap and purse, with a kind of addition showing how these fare\r\nin the hands of _Fortunatus's_ sons, and with a wild intermixture\r\n(according to the luckless habit above noted) of kings and lords, and\r\npseudo-historical incidents. No example of the kind is more chaotic in\r\nmovement and action. But the interlude of Fortune with which it is ushered\r\nin is conceived in the highest romantic spirit, and told in verse of\r\nwonderful effectiveness, not to mention two beautiful songs; and throughout\r\nthe play the allegorical or supernatural passages show the same character.\r\nNor are the more prosaic parts inferior, as, for instance, the pretty\r\ndialogue of Orleans and Galloway, cited by Lamb, and the fine passage where\r\nAndelocia says what he will do \"to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n    _Fort._ \"No more: curse on: your cries to me are music,\r\n            And fill the sacred roundure of mine ears\r\n            With tunes more sweet than moving of the spheres.\r\n            Curse on: on our celestial brows do sit\r\n            Unnumbered smiles, which then leap from their throne\r\n            When they see peasants dance and monarchs groan.\r\n            Behold you not this Globe, this golden bowl,\r\n            This toy call'd world at our Imperial feet?\r\n            This world is Fortune's ball wherewith she sports.\r\n            Sometimes I strike it up into the air,\r\n            And then create I Emperors and Kings.\r\n            Sometimes I spurn it: at which spurn crawls out\r\n            That wild beast multitude: curse on, you fools.\r\n            'Tis I that tumble Princes from their thrones,\r\n            And gild false brows with glittering diadems.\r\n            'Tis I that tread on necks of conquerors,\r\n            And when like semi-gods they have been drawn,\r\n            In ivory chariots to the capitol,\r\n            Circled about with wonder of all eyes\r\n            The shouts of every tongue, love of all hearts\r\n            Being swoll'n with their own greatness, I have prick'd\r\n            The bladder of their pride, and made them die,\r\n            As water bubbles, without memory.\r\n            I thrust base cowards into honour's chair,\r\n            Whilst the true spirited soldier stands by\r\n            Bare headed, and all bare, whilst at his scars\r\n            They scoff, that ne'er durst view the face of wars.\r\n            I set an Idiot's cap on virtue's head,\r\n            Turn learning out of doors, clothe wit in rags\r\n            And paint ten thousand images of loam\r\n            In gaudy silken colours: on the backs\r\n            Of mules and asses I make asses ride\r\n            Only for sport, to see the apish world\r\n            Worship such beasts with sound idolatry.\r\n            This Fortune does, and when this is done,\r\n            She sits and smiles to hear some curse her name,\r\n            And some with adoration crown her fame.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _And._ \"To-morrow? ay to-morrow thou shalt buy them.\r\n            To-morrow tell the Princess I will love her,\r\n            To-morrow tell the King I'll banquet him,\r\n            To-morrow, Shadow, will I give thee gold,\r\n            To-morrow pride goes bare, and lust a-cold.\r\n            To-morrow will the rich man feed the poor,\r\n            And vice to-morrow virtue will adore.\r\n            To-morrow beggars shall be crowned kings.\r\n            This no-time, morrow's time, no sweetness sings.\r\n            I pray thee hence: bear that to Agripyne.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole is, as a whole, to the last degree crude and undigested, but the\r\nill-matured power of the writer is almost the more apparent.\r\n\r\n_The Honest Whore_, in two parts, is, as far as general character goes, a\r\nmixed comedy of intrigue and manners combining, or rather uniting (for\r\nthere is little combination of them), four themes--first, the love of\r\nHippolito for the Princess Infelice, and his virtuous motions followed by\r\nrelapse; secondly, the conversion by him of the courtesan Bellafront, a\r\ndamsel of good family, from her evil ways, and her marriage to her first\r\ngallant, a hairbrained courtier named Matheo; thirdly, Matheo's\r\nill-treatment of Bellafront, her constancy and her rejection of the\r\ntemptations of Hippolito, who from apostle has turned seducer, with the\r\nhumours of Orlando Friscobaldo, Bellafront's father, who, feigning never to\r\nforgive her, watches over her in disguise, and acts as guardian angel to\r\nher reckless and sometimes brutal husband; and lastly, the other humours of\r\na certain marvellously patient citizen who allows his wife to hector him,\r\nhis customers to bully and cheat him, and who pushes his eccentric and\r\nunmanly patience to the point of enduring both madhouse and jail. Lamb,\r\nwhile ranking a single speech of Bellafront's very high, speaks with rather\r\noblique approval of the play, and Hazlitt, though enthusiastic for it,\r\nadmires chiefly old Friscobaldo and the ne'er-do-well Matheo. My own reason\r\nfor preferring it to almost all the non-tragical work of the time out of\r\nShakespere, is the wonderful character of Bellafront, both in her\r\nunreclaimed and her reclaimed condition. In both she is a very woman--not\r\nas conventional satirists and conventional encomiasts praise or rail at\r\nwomen, but as women are. If her language in her unregenerate days is\r\nsometimes coarser than is altogether pleasant, it does not disguise her\r\nnature,--the very nature of such a woman misled by giddiness, by\r\ncuriosity, by love of pleasure, by love of admiration, but in no thorough\r\nsense depraved. Her selection of Matheo not as the instrument of her being\r\n\"made an honest woman,\" not apparently because she had any love for him\r\nleft, or had ever had much, but because he was her first seducer, is\r\nexactly what, after a sudden convincing of sin, such a woman would have\r\ndone; and if her patience under the long trial of her husband's\r\nthoughtlessness and occasional brutality seem excessive, it will only seem\r\nso to one who has been unlucky in his experience. Matheo indeed is a\r\nthorough good-for-nothing, and the natural man longs that Bellafront might\r\nhave been better parted; but Dekker was a very moral person in his own way,\r\nand apparently he would not entirely let her--Imogen gone astray as she\r\nis--off her penance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nLATER ELIZABETHAN AND JACOBEAN PROSE\r\n\r\n\r\nOne name so far dominates the prose literature of the last years of\r\nElizabeth, and that of the whole reign of James, that it has probably alone\r\nsecured attention in the general memory, except such as may be given to the\r\npurple patches (of the true Tyrian dye, but not extremely numerous) which\r\ndecorate here and there the somewhat featureless expanse of Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh's _History of the World_. That name, it is scarcely necessary to\r\nsay, is the name of Francis Bacon. Bacon's eventful life, his much debated\r\ncharacter, his philosophical and scientific position, are all matters\r\nbeyond our subject. But as it is of the first importance in studying that\r\nsubject to keep dates and circumstances generally, if not minutely, in\r\nview, it may be well to give a brief summary of his career. He was born in\r\n1561, the son of Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper; he went very young to\r\nCambridge, and though early put to the study of the law, discovered an\r\nequally early bent in another direction. He was unfortunate in not\r\nobtaining the patronage then necessary to all men not of independent\r\nfortune. Though Elizabeth was personally familiar with him, she gave him\r\nnothing of importance--whether owing to the jealousy of his uncle and\r\ncousin, Burleigh and Robert Cecil, is a point not quite certain. The\r\npatronage of Essex did him very little good, and drew him into the worst\r\naction of his life. But after Elizabeth's death, and when a man of middle\r\nage, he at last began to mount the ladder, and came with some rapidity to\r\nthe summit of his profession, being made Lord Chancellor, and created Baron\r\nVerulam and Viscount St. Alban. The title Lord Bacon he never bore in\r\nstrictness, but it has been consecrated by the use of many generations, and\r\nit is perhaps pedantry to object to it. Entangled as a courtier in the\r\nrising hatred of the Court felt by the popular party, exposed by his own\r\ncarelessness, if not by actual venality in office, to the attacks of his\r\nenemies, and weakly supported, if supported at all, by the favourite\r\nBuckingham (who seems to have thought that Bacon took too much upon himself\r\nin state affairs), he lost, in 1621, all his places and emoluments, and was\r\nheavily fined. The retirement of his last few years produced much literary\r\nfruit, and he died (his death being caused or hastened by an injudicious\r\nexperiment) in 1626.\r\n\r\nGreat as is the place that Bacon occupies in English literature, he\r\noccupies it, as it were, _malgre lui_. Unlike almost all the greatest men\r\nof his own and even of the preceding generation, he seems to have thought\r\nlittle of the capacities, and less of the chances of the English language.\r\nHe held (and, unluckily for him, expressed his opinion in writing) that\r\n\"these modern languages will at one time or the other play the bankrupt\r\nwith books,\" and even when he wrote in the despised vernacular he took care\r\nto translate his work, or have it translated, into Latin in order to\r\nforestall the oblivion he dreaded. Nor is this his only phrase of contempt\r\ntowards his mother-tongue--the tongue which in his own lifetime served as a\r\nvehicle to a literature compared with which the whole literary achievement\r\nof Latin antiquity is but a neat school exercise, and which in every point\r\nbut accomplished precision of form may challenge comparison with Greek\r\nitself. This insensibility of Bacon's is characteristic enough, and might,\r\nif this were the place for any such subtlety, be connected with the other\r\ndefects of his strangely blended character--his pusillanimity, his lack of\r\npassion (let any one read the Essay on Love, and remember that some\r\npersons, not always inmates of lunatic asylums, have held that Bacon wrote\r\nthe plays of Shakespere), his love of empty pomp and display, and so\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nBut the English language which he thus despised had a noble and worthy\r\nrevenge on Bacon. Of his Latin works hardly anything but the _Novum\r\nOrganum_ is now read even for scholastic purposes, and it is not certain\r\nthat, but for the saving influences of academical study and prescription,\r\neven that might not slip out of the knowledge of all but specialists. But\r\nwith the wider and wider spread and study of English the _Essays_ and _The\r\nAdvancement of Learning_ are read ever more and more, and the only reason\r\nthat _The History of Henry VII._, _The New Atlantis_, and the _Sylva\r\nSylvarum_ do not receive equal attention, lies in the comparative\r\nobsoleteness of their matter, combined with the fact that the matter is the\r\nchief thing on which attention is bestowed in them. Even in the two works\r\nnoted, the _Essays_ and _The Advancement_, which can go both together in a\r\nsmall volume, Bacon shows himself at his very greatest in all respects, and\r\n(ignorant or careless as he was of the fact) as one of the greatest writers\r\nof English prose before the accession of Charles I.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of style in these two works are by no means the same;\r\nbut between them they represent fairly enough the characteristics of all\r\nBacon's English prose. It might indeed be desirable in studying it to add\r\nto them the _Henry the Seventh_, which is a model of clear historical\r\nnarration, not exactly picturesque, but never dull; and though not exactly\r\nerudite, yet by no means wanting in erudition, and exhibiting conclusions\r\nwhich, after two centuries and a half of record-grubbing, have not been\r\nseriously impugned or greatly altered by any modern historian. In this\r\nbook, which was written late, Bacon had, of course, the advantage of his\r\nlong previous training in the actual politics of a school not very greatly\r\naltered since the time he was describing, but this does not diminish the\r\ncredit due to him for formal excellence.\r\n\r\nThe _Essays_--which Bacon issued for the first time, to the number of ten,\r\nin 1597, when he was, comparatively speaking, a young man, which he\r\nreissued largely augmented in 1612, and yet again just before his death, in\r\ntheir final and fullest condition--are not so much in the modern sense\r\nessays as collections of thoughts more or less connected. We have, indeed,\r\nthe genesis of them in the very interesting commonplace book called the\r\n_Promus_ [butler or storekeeper] _of Elegancies_, the publication of which,\r\nas a whole, was for some reason or other not undertaken by Mr. Spedding,\r\nand is due to Mrs. Henry Pott. Here we have the quaint, but never merely\r\nquaint, analogies, the apt quotations, the singular flashes of reflection\r\nand illustration, which characterise Bacon, in their most unformed and\r\nnew-born condition. In the _Essays_ they are worked together, but still\r\nsententiously, and evidently with no attempt at sustained and fluent\r\nconnection of style. That Montaigne must have had some influence on Bacon\r\nis, of course, certain; though few things can be more unlike than the curt\r\nseverity of the scheme of the English essays and the interminable\r\ndiffuseness of the French. Yet here and there are passages in Montaigne\r\nwhich might almost be the work of a French Bacon, and in Bacon passages\r\nwhich might easily be the work of an English Montaigne. In both there is\r\nthe same odd mixture of dignity and familiarity--the familiarity\r\npredominating in Montaigne, the dignity in Bacon--and in both there is the\r\nunion of a rich fancy and a profound interest in ethical questions, with a\r\ncurious absence of passion and enthusiasm--a touch, as it may almost be\r\ncalled, of Philistinism, which in Bacon's case contrasts most strangely\r\nwith his frequently gorgeous language, and the evident richness of his\r\nimagination, or at least his fancy.\r\n\r\nThe scheme and manner of these essays naturally induced a sententious and\r\nalmost undeveloped manner of writing. An extraordinary number of separate\r\nphrases and sentences, which have become the common property of all who use\r\nthe language, and are probably most often used without any clear idea of\r\ntheir author, may be disinterred from them, as well as many striking images\r\nand pregnant thoughts, which have had less general currency. But the\r\ncompression of them (which is often so great that they might be printed\r\nsentence by sentence like verses of the Bible) prevents the author from\r\ndisplaying his command of a consecutive, elaborated, and harmonised style.\r\nWhat command he had of that style may be found, without looking far, in the\r\n_Henry the Seventh_, in the _Atlantis_, and in various minor works, some\r\noriginally written in Latin and translated, such as the magnificent passage\r\nwhich Dean Church has selected as describing the purpose and crown of the\r\nBaconian system. In such passages the purely oratorical faculty which he\r\nundoubtedly had (though like all the earlier oratory of England, with rare\r\nexceptions, its examples remain a mere tradition, and hardly even that)\r\ndisplays itself; and one cannot help regretting that, instead of going into\r\nthe law, where he never attained to much technical excellence, and where\r\nhis mere promotion was at first slow, and was no sooner quickened than it\r\nbrought him into difficulties and dangers, he had not sought the safer and\r\ncalmer haven of the Church, where he would have been more at leisure to\r\n\"take all knowledge to be his province;\" would have been less tempted to\r\nengage in the treacherous, and to him always but half-congenial, business\r\nof politics, and would have forestalled, and perhaps excelled, Jeremy\r\nTaylor as a sacred orator. If Bacon be Jeremy's inferior in exuberant\r\ngorgeousness, he is very much his superior in order and proportion, and\r\nquite his equal in sudden flashes of a quaint but illuminative rhetoric.\r\nFor after all that has been said of Bacon and his philosophy, he was a\r\nrhetorician rather than a philosopher. Half the puzzlement which has arisen\r\nin the efforts to get something exact out of the stately periods and\r\nsplendid promises of the _Novum Organum_ and its companions has arisen from\r\noversight of this eminently rhetorical character; and this character is the\r\nchief property of his style. It may seem presumptuous to extend the charges\r\nof want of depth which were formulated by good authorities in law and\r\nphysics against Bacon in his own day, yet he is everywhere \"not deep.\" He\r\nis stimulating beyond the recorded power of any other man except Socrates;\r\nhe is inexhaustible in analogy and illustration, full of wise saws, and of\r\ninstances as well ancient as modern. But he is by no means an accurate\r\nexpositor, still less a powerful reasoner, and his style is exactly suited\r\nto his mental gifts; now luminously fluent, now pregnantly brief; here just\r\nobscure enough to kindle the reader's desire of penetrating the obscurity,\r\nthere flashing with ornament which perhaps serves to conceal a flaw in the\r\nreasoning, but which certainly serves to allure and retain the attention of\r\nthe student. All these characteristics are the characteristics rather of\r\nthe great orator than of the great philosopher. His constant practice in\r\nevery kind of literary composition, and in the meditative thought which\r\nconstant literary composition perhaps sometimes tempts its practitioners to\r\ndispense with, enabled him to write on a vast variety of subjects, and in\r\nmany different styles. But of these it will always be found that two were\r\nmost familiar to him, the short sententious apothegm, parallel, or image,\r\nwhich suggests and stimulates even when it does not instruct, and the\r\nhalf-hortatory half-descriptive _discours d'ouverture_, where the writer is\r\nthe unwearied panegyrist of promised lands not perhaps to be identified\r\nwith great ease on any chart.[38]\r\n\r\n[38] Of Bacon in prose, as of Spenser, Shakespere, and Milton in verse, it\r\ndoes not seem necessary to give extracts, and for the same reason.\r\n\r\nA parallel in the Plutarchian manner between Bacon and Raleigh would in\r\nmany ways be pleasant, but only one point of it concerns us here,--that\r\nboth had been happier and perhaps had done greater things had they been\r\nsimple men of letters. Unlike Bacon, who, though he wrote fair verse, shows\r\nno poetical bent, Raleigh was _homo utriusque linguae_, and his works in\r\nverse, unequal as they are, occasionally touch the loftiest summits of\r\npoetry. It is very much the same in his prose. His minor books, mostly\r\nwritten hurriedly, and for a purpose, have hardly any share of the graces\r\nof style; and his masterpiece, the famous _History of the World_, is made\r\nup of short passages of the most extraordinary beauty, and long stretches\r\nof monotonous narration and digression, showing not much grace of style,\r\nand absolutely no sense of proportion or skill in arrangement. The\r\ncontrast is so strange that some have sought to see in the undoubted facts\r\nthat Raleigh, in his tedious prison labours, had assistants and helpers\r\n(Ben Jonson among others), a reason for the superior excellence of such set\r\npieces as the Preface, the Epilogue, and others, which are scattered about\r\nthe course of the work. But independently of the other fact that excellence\r\nof the most diverse kind meets us at every turn, though it also deserts us\r\nat every turn, in Raleigh's varied literary work, and that it would be\r\nabsurd to attribute all these passages to some \"affable familiar ghost,\"\r\nthere is the additional difficulty that in none of his reported helpers'\r\nown work do the peculiar graces of the purple passages of the _History_\r\noccur. The immortal descant on mortality with which the book closes, and\r\nwhich is one of the highest achievements of English prose, is not in the\r\nleast like Jonson, not in the least like Selden, not in the least like any\r\none of whose connection with Raleigh there is record. Donne might have\r\nwritten it; but there is not the smallest reason for supposing that he did,\r\nand many for being certain that he did not. Therefore, it is only fair to\r\ngive Raleigh himself the credit for this and all other passages of the\r\nkind. Their character and, at the same time, their comparative rarity are\r\nboth easily explicable. They are all obviously struck off in moments of\r\nexcitement--moments when the writer's variable and fanciful temperament was\r\nheated to flashing-point and gave off almost spontaneously these lightnings\r\nof prose as it gave, on other occasions, such lightnings of poetry as _The\r\nFaerie Queene_ sonnet, as \"the Lie,\" and as the other strange jewels (cats'\r\neyes and opals, rather than pearls or diamonds), which are strung along\r\nwith very many common pebbles on Raleigh's poetical necklace. In style they\r\nanticipate Browne (who probably learnt not a little from them) more than\r\nany other writer; and they cannot fairly be said to have been anticipated\r\nby any Englishman. The low and stately music of their cadences is a thing,\r\nexcept in Browne, almost unique, and it is not easy to trace it to any\r\npeculiar mannerism of vocabulary or of the arrangement of words. But\r\nRaleigh's usual style differs very little from that of other men of his\r\nday, who kept clear at once of euphuism and burlesque. Being chiefly\r\nnarrative, it is rather plainer than Hooker, who has some few points of\r\nresemblance with Raleigh, but considerably freer from the vices of\r\ndesultoriness and awkward syntax, than most writers of the day except\r\nHooker. But its most interesting characteristic to the student of\r\nliterature must always be the way in which it leads up to, without in the\r\nleast foretelling, the bursts of eloquence already referred to. Even\r\nMilton's alternations of splendid imagery with dull and scurrilous\r\ninvective, are hardly so strange as Raleigh's changes from jog-trot\r\ncommonplace to almost inspired declamation, if only for the reason that\r\nthey are much more intelligible. It must also be mentioned that Raleigh,\r\nlike Milton, seems to have had little or no humour.\r\n\r\nThe opening and closing passages of the _History_ are almost universally\r\nknown; a quainter, less splendid, but equally characteristic one may be\r\ngiven here though Mr. Arber has already extracted it:--\r\n\r\n     \"The four complexions resemble the four elements; and the seven\r\n     ages of man, the seven planets. Whereof our infancy is compared\r\n     to the moon; in which we seem only to live and grow, as plants.\r\n\r\n     \"The second age, to Mercury; wherein we are taught and\r\n     instructed.\r\n\r\n     \"Our third age, to Venus; the days of Love, Desire and Vanity.\r\n\r\n     \"The fourth, to the Sun; the strong, flourishing and beautiful\r\n     age of man's life.\r\n\r\n     \"The fifth, to Mars; in which we seek honour and victory; and in\r\n     which our thoughts travel to ambitious ends.\r\n\r\n     \"The sixth age is ascribed to Jupiter; in which we begin to take\r\n     account of our times, judge of ourselves, and grow to the\r\n     perfection of our understanding.\r\n\r\n     \"The last and seventh, to Saturn; wherein our days are sad and\r\n     overcast; and in which we find by dear and lamentable experience,\r\n     and by the loss which can never be repaired, that, of all our\r\n     vain passions and affections past, the sorrow only abideth. Our\r\n     attendants are sicknesses and variable infirmities: and by how\r\n     much the more we are accompanied with plenty, by so much the more\r\n     greedily is our end desired. Whom, when Time hath made unsociable\r\n     to others, we become a burden to ourselves: being of no other use\r\n     than to hold the riches we have from our successors. In this time\r\n     it is, when we, for the most part (and never before) prepare for\r\n     our Eternal Habitation, which we pass on unto with many sighs,\r\n     groans and sad thoughts: and in the end (by the workmanship of\r\n     Death) finish the sorrowful business of a wretched life. Towards\r\n     which we always travel, both sleeping and waking. Neither have\r\n     those beloved companions of honour and riches any power at all to\r\n     hold us any one day by the glorious promise of entertainments:\r\n     but by what crooked path soever we walk, the same leadeth on\r\n     directly to the House of Death, whose doors lie open at all\r\n     hours, and to all persons.\"\r\n\r\nBut great as are Bacon and Raleigh, they cannot approach, as writers of\r\nprose, the company of scholarly divines who produced--what is probably the\r\ngreatest prose work in any language--the Authorised Version of the Bible in\r\nEnglish. Now that there is at any rate some fear of this masterpiece\r\nceasing to be what it has been for three centuries--the school and training\r\nground of every man and woman of English speech in the noblest uses of\r\nEnglish tongue--every one who values that mother tongue is more especially\r\nbound to put on record his own allegiance to it. The work of the Company\r\nappears to have been loyally performed in common; and it is curious that\r\nsuch an unmatched result should have been the result of labours thus\r\ncombined, and not, as far as is known, controlled by any one guiding\r\nspirit. Among the translators were many excellent writers,--an advantage\r\nwhich they possessed in a much higher degree than their revisers in the\r\nnineteenth century, of whom few would be mentioned among the best living\r\nwriters of English by any competent authority. But, at the same time, no\r\nknown translator under James has left anything which at all equals in\r\nstrictly literary merit the Authorised Version, as it still is and as long\r\nmay it be. The fact is, however, less mysterious after a little examination\r\nthan it may seem at first sight. Putting aside all questions as to the\r\nintrinsic value of the subject-matter as out of our province, it will be\r\ngenerally admitted that the translators had in the greater part of the Old\r\nTestament, in a large part of the Apocrypha, and in no small part of the\r\nNew Testament, matter as distinguished from form, of very high literary\r\nvalue to begin with in their originals. In the second place, they had, in\r\nthe Septuagint and in the Vulgate, versions also of no small literary\r\nmerit to help them. In the third place, they had in the earlier English\r\nversions excellent quarries of suitable English terms, if not very\r\naccomplished models of style. These, however, were not in any way\r\nadvantages peculiar to themselves. The advantages which, in a manner at\r\nleast, were peculiar to themselves may be divided into two classes. They\r\nwere in the very centre of the great literary ferment of which in this\r\nvolume I am striving to give a history as little inadequate as possible.\r\nThey had in the air around them an English purged of archaisms and\r\nuncouthnesses, fully adapted to every literary purpose, and yet still racy\r\nof the soil, and free from that burden of hackneyed and outworn literary\r\nplatitudes and commonplaces with which centuries of voluminous literary\r\nproduction have vitiated and loaded the English of our own day. They were\r\nnot afraid of Latinising, but they had an ample stock of the pure\r\nvernacular to draw on. These things may be classed together. On the other\r\nside, but equally healthful, may be put the fact that the style and\r\nstructure of the originals and earlier versions, and especially that verse\r\ndivision which has been now so unwisely abandoned, served as safeguards\r\nagainst the besetting sin of all prose writers of their time, the habit of\r\nindulging in long wandering sentences, in paragraphs destitute of\r\nproportion and of grace, destitute even of ordinary manageableness and\r\nshape. The verses saved them from that once for all; while on the other\r\nhand their own taste, and the help given by the structure of the original\r\nin some cases, prevented them from losing sight of the wood for the trees,\r\nand omitting to consider the relation of verse to verse, as well as the\r\nantiphony of the clauses within the verse. Men without literary faculty\r\nmight no doubt have gone wrong; but these were men of great literary\r\nfaculty, whose chief liabilities to error were guarded against precisely by\r\nthe very conditions in which they found their work. The hour had come\r\nexactly, and so for once had the men.\r\n\r\nThe result of their labours is so universally known that it is not\r\nnecessary to say very much about it; but the mere fact of the universal\r\nknowledge carries with it a possibility of under-valuation. In another\r\nplace, dealing with the general subject of English prose style, I have\r\nselected the sixth and seventh verses of the eighth chapter of Solomon's\r\nSong as the best example known to me of absolutely perfect English\r\nprose--harmonious, modulated, yet in no sense trespassing the limits of\r\nprose and becoming poetry. I have in the same place selected, as a\r\ncompanion passage from a very different original, the Charity passage of\r\nthe First Epistle to the Corinthians, which has been so miserably and\r\nwantonly mangled and spoilt by the bad taste and ignorance of the late\r\nrevisers. I am tempted to dwell on this because it is very germane to our\r\nsubject. One of the blunders which spoils this passage in the Revised\r\nVersion is the pedantic substitution of \"mirror\" for \"glass,\" it having\r\napparently occurred to some wiseacre that glass was not known to the\r\nancients, or at least used for mirrors. Had this wiseacre had the slightest\r\nknowledge of English literature, a single title of Gascoigne's, \"The Steel\r\nGlass,\" would have dispensed him at once from any attempt at emendation;\r\nbut this is ever and always the way of the sciolist. Fortunately such a\r\nnational possession as the original Authorised Version, when once\r\nmultiplied and dispersed by the press, is out of reach of vandalism. The\r\nimproved version, constructed on very much the same principle as Davenant's\r\nor Ravenscroft's improvements on Shakespere, may be ordered to be read in\r\nchurches, and substituted for purposes of taking oaths. But the original\r\n(as it may be called in no burlesque sense such as that of a famous story)\r\nwill always be the text resorted to by scholars and men of letters for\r\npurposes of reading, and will remain the authentic lexicon, the recognised\r\nsource of English words and constructions of the best period. The days of\r\ncreation; the narratives of Joseph and his brethren, of Ruth, of the final\r\ndefeat of Ahab, of the discomfiture of the Assyrian host of Sennacherib;\r\nthe moral discourses of Ecclesiastes and Ecclesiasticus and the Book of\r\nWisdom; the poems of the Psalms and the prophets; the visions of the\r\nRevelation,--a hundred other passages which it is unnecessary to\r\ncatalogue,--will always be the _ne plus ultra_ of English composition in\r\ntheir several kinds, and the storehouse from which generation after\r\ngeneration of writers, sometimes actually hostile to religion and often\r\nindifferent to it, will draw the materials, and not unfrequently the actual\r\nform of their most impassioned and elaborate passages. Revision after\r\nrevision, constructed in corrupt following of the transient and embarrassed\r\nphantoms of ephemeral fashion in scholarship, may sink into the Great\r\nMother of Dead Dogs after setting right a tense here, and there\r\ntransferring a rendering from text to margin or from margin to text. But\r\nthe work of the unrevised version will remain unaffected by each of these\r\nfutile exercitations. All the elements, all the circumstances of a\r\ntranslation as perfect as can be accomplished in any circumstances and with\r\nany elements, were then present, and the workers were worthy of the work.\r\nThe plays of Shakespere and the English Bible are, and will ever be, the\r\ntwin monuments not merely of their own period, but of the perfection of\r\nEnglish, the complete expressions of the literary capacities of the\r\nlanguage, at the time when it had lost none of its pristine vigour, and had\r\nput on enough but not too much of the adornments and the limitations of\r\nwhat may be called literary civilisation.\r\n\r\nThe boundary between the prose of this period and that which we shall treat\r\nlater as \"Caroline\" is not very clearly fixed. Some men, such as Hall and\r\nDonne, whose poetical work runs parallel to that in prose which we are now\r\nnoticing, come as prose writers rather under the later date; others who\r\ncontinued to write till long after Elizabeth's death, and even after that\r\nof James, seem, by their general complexion, to belong chiefly to the\r\nearlier day. The first of these is Ben Jonson, whose high reputation in\r\nother ways has somewhat unduly damaged, or at least obscured, his merits as\r\na prose writer. His two chief works in this kind are his _English Grammar_,\r\nin which a sound knowledge of the rules of English writing is discovered,\r\nand the quaintly named _Explorata_ or _Discoveries_ and _Timber_--a\r\ncollection of notes varying from a mere aphorism to a respectable essay.\r\nIn these latter a singular power of writing prose appears. The book was not\r\npublished till after Ben's death, and is thought to have been in part at\r\nleast written during the last years of his life. But there can be no\r\ngreater contrast than exists between the prose style usual at that time--a\r\n_style tourmente_, choked with quotation, twisted in every direction by\r\nallusion and conceit, and marred by perpetual confusions of English with\r\nclassical grammar--and the straightforward, vigorous English of these\r\n_Discoveries_. They come, in character as in time, midway between Hooker\r\nand Dryden, and they incline rather to the more than to the less modern\r\nform. Here is found the prose character of Shakespere which, if less\r\nmagniloquent than that in verse, has a greater touch of sheer sincerity.\r\nHere, too, is an admirable short tractate on Style which exemplifies what\r\nit preaches; and a large number of other excellent things. Some, it is\r\ntrue, are set down in a shorthand fashion as if (which doubtless they were)\r\nthey were commonplace-book notes for working up in due season. But others\r\nand perhaps the majority (they all Baconian-wise have Latin titles, though\r\nonly one or two have the text in Latin) are written with complete attention\r\nto literary presentment; seldom though sometimes relapsing into loose\r\nconstruction of sentences and paragraphs, the besetting sin of the day, and\r\noften presenting, as in the following, a model of sententious but not dry\r\nform:--\r\n\r\n     \"We should not protect our sloth with the patronage of\r\n     difficulty. It is a false quarrel against nature that she helps\r\n     understanding but in a few, when the most part of mankind are\r\n     inclined by her thither, if they would take the pains; no less\r\n     than birds to fly, horses to run, etc., which if they lose it is\r\n     through their own sluggishness, and by that means become her\r\n     prodigies, not her children. I confess nature in children is more\r\n     patient of labour in study than in age; for the sense of the\r\n     pain, the judgment of the labour is absent, they do not measure\r\n     what they have done. And it is the thought and consideration that\r\n     affects us more than the weariness itself. Plato was not content\r\n     with the learning that Athens could give him, but sailed into\r\n     Italy, for Pythagoras' knowledge: and yet not thinking himself\r\n     sufficiently informed, went into Egypt, to the priests, and\r\n     learned their mysteries. He laboured, so must we. Many things may\r\n     be learned together and performed in one point of time; as\r\n     musicians exercise their memory, their voice, their fingers, and\r\n     sometimes their head and feet at once. And so a preacher, in the\r\n     invention of matter, election of words, composition of gesture,\r\n     look, pronunciation, motion, useth all these faculties at once:\r\n     and if we can express this variety together, why should not\r\n     divers studies, at divers hours, delight, when the variety is\r\n     able alone to refresh and repair us? As when a man is weary of\r\n     writing, to read; and then again of reading, to write. Wherein,\r\n     howsoever we do many things, yet are we (in a sort) still fresh\r\n     to what we begin; we are recreated with change as the stomach is\r\n     with meats. But some will say, this variety breeds confusion, and\r\n     makes that either we lose all or hold no more than the last. Why\r\n     do we not then persuade husbandmen that they should not till\r\n     land, help it with marle, lime, and compost? plant hop gardens,\r\n     prune trees, look to beehives, rear sheep, and all other cattle\r\n     at once? It is easier to do many things and continue, than to do\r\n     one thing long.\"\r\n\r\nNo other single writer until we come to the pamphleteers deserves separate\r\nor substantive mention; but in many divisions of literature there were\r\npractitioners who, if they have not kept much notoriety as masters of\r\nstyle, were well thought of even in that respect in their day, and were\r\nlong authorities in point of matter. The regular theological treatises of\r\nthe time present nothing equal to Hooker, who in part overlapped it, though\r\nthe Jesuit Parsons has some name for vigorous writing. In history, Knolles,\r\nthe historian of the Turks, and Sandys, the Eastern traveller and sacred\r\npoet, bear the bell for style among their fellows, such as Hayward, Camden,\r\nSpelman, Speed, and Stow. Daniel the poet, a very good prose writer in his\r\nway, was also a historian of England, but his chief prose work was his\r\n_Defence of Rhyme_. He had companions in the critical task; but it is\r\ncurious and by no means uninstructive to notice, that the immense creative\r\nproduction of the time seems to have to a great extent smothered the\r\ntheoretic and critical tendency which, as yet not resulting in actual\r\nperformance, betrayed itself at the beginning of the period in Webbe and\r\nPuttenham, in Harvey and Sidney. The example of Eden in collecting and\r\nEnglishing travels and voyages was followed by several writers, of whom\r\ntwo, successively working and residing, the elder at Oxford, and the\r\nyounger at Cambridge, made the two greatest collections of the kind in the\r\nlanguage for interest of matter, if not for perfection of style. These\r\nwere Richard Hakluyt and Samuel Purchas, a venerable pair. The perhaps\r\noverpraised, but still excellent Characters of the unfortunate Sir Thomas\r\nOverbury and the prose works, such as the _Counterblast_ and _Demonology_,\r\nof James I., are books whose authors have made them more famous than their\r\nintrinsic merits warrant, and in the various collections of \"works\" of the\r\nday, older and newer, we shall find examples nearly as miscellaneous as\r\nthose of the class of writers now to be noticed. Of all this miscellaneous\r\nwork it is impossible to give examples, but one critical passage from\r\nDaniel, and one descriptive from Hakluyt may serve:--\r\n\r\n     \"Methinks we should not so soon yield up our consents captive to\r\n     the authority of antiquity, unless we saw more reason; all our\r\n     understandings are not to be built by the square of Greece and\r\n     Italy. We are the children of nature as well as they, we are not\r\n     so placed out of the way of judgment but that the same sun of\r\n     discretion shineth upon us; we have our portion of the same\r\n     virtues, as well as of the same vices, et Catilinam quocunque in\r\n     populo videas, quocunque sub axe. Time and the turn of things\r\n     bring about these faculties according to the present estimation;\r\n     and, res temporibus, non tempore rebus servire opportet. So that\r\n     we must never rebel against use; quem penes arbitrium est, et vis\r\n     et norma loquendi. It is not the observing of trochaics nor their\r\n     iambics, that will make our writings aught the wiser: all their\r\n     poesy and all their philosophy is nothing, unless we bring the\r\n     discerning light of conceit with us to apply it to use. It is not\r\n     books, but only that great book of the world, and the\r\n     all-overspreading grace of Heaven that makes men truly judicial.\r\n     Nor can it but touch of arrogant ignorance to hold this or that\r\n     nation barbarous, these or those times gross, considering how\r\n     this manifold creature man, wheresoever he stand in the world,\r\n     hath always some disposition of worth, entertains the order of\r\n     society, affects that which is most in use, and is eminent in\r\n     some one thing or other that fits his humour or the times. The\r\n     Grecians held all other nations barbarous but themselves; yet\r\n     Pyrrhus, when he saw the well ordered marching of the Romans,\r\n     which made them see their presumptuous error, could say it was no\r\n     barbarous manner of proceeding. The Goths, Vandals, and\r\n     Longobards, whose coming down like an inundation overwhelmed, as\r\n     they say, all the glory of learning in Europe, have yet left us\r\n     still their laws and customs, as the originals of most of the\r\n     provincial constitutions of Christendom; which, well considered\r\n     with their other courses of government, may serve to clear them\r\n     from this imputation of ignorance. And though the vanquished\r\n     never speak well of the conqueror, yet even through the unsound\r\n     coverings of malediction appear these monuments of truth, as\r\n     argue well their worth, and proves them not without judgment,\r\n     though without Greek and Latin.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"To speak somewhat of these islands, being called, in old time,\r\n     _Insulae fortunae_, by the means of the flourishing thereof.

For they make wine better then any in Spain: and they\r\n     have grapes of such bigness that they may be compared to damsons,\r\n     and in taste inferior to none. For sugar, suckets, raisons of the\r\n     sun, and many other fruits, abundance: for rosin, and raw silk,\r\n     there is great store. They want neither corn, pullets, cattle,\r\n     nor yet wild fowl.\r\n\r\n     \"They have many camels also: which, being young, are eaten of the\r\n     people for victuals; and being old, they are used for carriage of\r\n     necessities. Whose property is, as he is taught, to kneel at the\r\n     taking of his load, and the unlading again; of understanding very\r\n     good, but of shape very deformed; with a little belly; long\r\n     misshapen legs; and feet very broad of flesh, without a hoof, all\r\n     whole saving the great toe; a back bearing up like a molehill, a\r\n     large and thin neck, with a little head, with a bunch of hard\r\n     flesh which Nature hath given him in his breast to lean upon.\r\n     This beast liveth hardly, and is contented with straw and\r\n     stubble; but of strong force, being well able to carry five\r\n     hundredweight.\r\n\r\n     \"In one of these islands called Ferro, there is, by the reports\r\n     of the inhabitants, a certain tree which raineth continually; by\r\n     the dropping whereof the inhabitants and cattle are satisfied\r\n     with water: for other water have they none in all the island. And\r\n     it raineth in such abundance that it were incredible unto a man\r\n     to believe such a virtue to be in a tree; but it is known to be a\r\n     Divine matter, and a thing ordained by God: at Whose power\r\n     therein, we ought not to marvel, seeing He did, by His Providence\r\n     (as we read in the Scriptures) when the Children of Israel were\r\n     going into the Land of Promise, feed them with manna from heaven,\r\n     for the space of forty years. Of these trees aforesaid, we saw in\r\n     Guinea many; being of great height, dropping continually; but not\r\n     so abundantly as the other, because the leaves are narrower and\r\n     are like the leaves of a pear tree. About these islands are\r\n     certain flitting islands, which have been oftentimes seen; and\r\n     when men approach near them, they vanished: as the like hath been\r\n     of these now known (by the report of the inhabitants) which were\r\n     not found but of a long time, one after the other; and,\r\n     therefore, it should seem he is not yet born, to whom God hath\r\n     appointed the finding of them.\r\n\r\n     \"In this island of Teneriff, there is a hill called the Pike,\r\n     because it is piked; which is, in height, by their report, twenty\r\n     leagues: having, both winter and summer, abundance of snow on the\r\n     top of it. This Pike may be seen, in a clear day, fifty leagues\r\n     off; but it sheweth as though it were a black cloud a great\r\n     height in the element. I have heard of none to be compared with\r\n     this in height; but in the Indies I have seen many, and, in my\r\n     judgment, not inferior to the Pike: and so the Spaniards write.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable developments of English prose at the time, and\r\none which has until very recently been almost inaccessible, except in a few\r\nexamples, to the student who has not the command of large libraries, while\r\neven by such students it has seldom been thoroughly examined, is the\r\nabundant and very miscellaneous collection of what are called, for want of\r\na better name, Pamphlets. The term is not too happy, but there is no other\r\n(except the still less happy Miscellany) which describes the thing. It\r\nconsists of a vast mass of purely popular literature, seldom written with\r\nany other aim than that of the modern journalist. That is to say, it was\r\nwritten to meet a current demand, to deal with subjects for one reason or\r\nother interesting at the moment, and, as a matter of course, to bring in\r\nsome profit to the writer. These pamphlets are thus as destitute of any\r\nlogical community of subject as the articles which compose a modern\r\nnewspaper--a production the absence of which they no doubt supplied, and of\r\nwhich they were in a way the forerunners. Attempts to classify their\r\nsubjects could only end in a hopeless cross division. They are religious\r\nvery often; political very seldom (for the fate of the luckless Stubbes in\r\nhis dealings with the French marriage was not suited to attract);\r\npolitico-religious in at least the instance of one famous group, the\r\nso-called Martin Marprelate Controversy; moral constantly; in very many,\r\nespecially the earlier instances, narrative, and following to a large\r\nextent in the steps of Lyly and Sidney; besides a large class of curious\r\ntracts dealing with the manners, and usually the bad side of the manners,\r\nof the town. Of the vast miscellaneous mass of these works by single\r\nunimportant or unknown authors it is almost impossible to give any account\r\nhere, though valuable instances will be found of them in Mr. Arber's\r\n_English Garner_. But the works of the six most important individual\r\nwriters of them--Greene, Nash, Harvey, Dekker, Lodge, Breton (to whom\r\nmight be added the verse-pamphleteer, but in no sense poet, Rowlands)--are\r\nluckily now accessible as wholes, Lodge and Rowlands having been published,\r\nor at least privately printed for subscribers, by the Hunterian Club of\r\nGlasgow, and the other five by the prolific industry of Dr. Grosart. The\r\nreprints of Petheram and of Mr. Arber, with new editions of Lyly and\r\nothers, have made most of the Marprelate tracts accessible. Some notice of\r\nthese collections will not only give a fair idea of the entire\r\nmiscellaneous prose of the Elizabethan period, but will also fill a\r\ndistinct gap in most histories of it. It will not be necessary to enter\r\ninto much personal detail about their authors, for most of them have been\r\nnoticed already in other capacities, and of Breton and Rowlands very little\r\nindeed is known. Greene and Lodge stand apart from their fellows in this\r\nrespect, that their work is, in some respects at any rate, much more like\r\nliterature and less like journalism, though by an odd and apparently\r\nperverse chance, this difference has rather hurt than saved it in the\r\nestimation of posterity. For the kind of literature which both wrote in\r\nthis way has gone out of fashion, and its purely literary graces are barely\r\nsufficient to save it from the point of view of form; while the bitter\r\npersonalities of Nash, and the quaint adaptations of bygone satire to\r\ncontemporary London life in which Dekker excelled, have a certain lasting\r\ninterest of matter. On the other hand, the two companions of Marlowe have\r\nthe advantage (which they little anticipated, and would perhaps less have\r\nrelished) of surviving as illustrations of Shakespere, of the Shakescene\r\nwho, decking himself out in their feathers, has by that act rescued\r\n_Pandosto_ and _Euphues' Golden Legacy_ from oblivion by associating them\r\nwith the immortality of _As You Like It_ and _The Winter's Tale_.\r\n\r\nOwing to the different forms in which this fleeting and unequal work has\r\nbeen reprinted, it is not very easy to decide off-hand on the relative bulk\r\nof the authors' works. But the palm in this respect must be divided between\r\nRobert Greene and Nicholas Breton, the former of whom fills eleven volumes\r\nof loosely-printed crown octavo, and the latter (in prose only) a thick\r\nquarto of very small and closely-printed double columns. Greene, who began\r\nhis work early under the immediate inspiration first of his travels and\r\nthen of Lyly's _Euphues_, started, as early as 1583, with _Mamillia, a\r\nLooking-Glass for the Ladies of England_, which, both in general character\r\nand in peculiarities of style, is an obvious copy of _Euphues_. _The Mirror\r\nof Modesty_ is more of a lay sermon, based on the story of Susanna. _The\r\nTritameron of Love_ is a dialogue without action, but _Arbasto, or the\r\nAnatomie of Fortune_ returns to the novel form, as does _The Card of\r\nFancy_. _Planetomachia_ is a collection of stories, illustrating the\r\npopular astrological notions, with an introduction on astrology generally.\r\n_Penelope's Web_ is another collection of stories, but _The Spanish\r\nMasquerado_ is one of the most interesting of the series. Written just at\r\nthe time of the Armada, it is pure journalism--a _livre de circonstance_\r\ncomposed to catch the popular temper with aid of a certain actual\r\nknowledge, and a fair amount of reading. Then Greene returned to euphuism\r\nin _Menaphon_, and in _Euphues, his Censure to Philautus_; nor are\r\n_Perimedes the Blacksmith_ and _Tully's Love_ much out of the same line.\r\n_The Royal Exchange_ again deviates, being a very quaint collection,\r\nquaintly arranged, of moral maxims, apophthegms, short stories, etc., for\r\nthe use of the citizens. Next, the author began the curious series, at\r\nfirst perhaps not very sincere, but certainly becoming so at last, of\r\nhalf-personal reminiscences and regrets, less pointed and well arranged\r\nthan Villon's, but remarkably similar. The first and longest of these was\r\n_Greene's Never too Late_, with its second part _Francesco's Fortunes_.\r\n_Greene's Metamorphosis_ is Euphuist once more, and _Greene's Mourning\r\nGarment_ and _Greene's Farewell to Folly_ are the same, with a touch of\r\npersonality. Then he diverged into the still more curious series on\r\n\"conny-catching\"--rooking, gulling, cheating, as we should call it. There\r\nare five or six of these tracts, and though there is not a little\r\nbookmaking in them, they are unquestionably full of instruction as to the\r\nways of the time. _Philomela_ returns once more to euphuism, but Greene is\r\nsoon back again with _A Quip for an Upstart Courtier_, a piece of social\r\nsatire, flying rather higher than his previous attempts. The zigzag is kept\r\nup in _Orpharion_, the last printed (at least in the only edition now\r\nknown) of the author's works during his lifetime. Not till after his death\r\ndid the best known and most personal of all his works appear, the famous\r\n_Groat's Worth of Wit Bought with a Million of Repentance_, in which the\r\n\"Shakescene\" passage and the exhortation to his friends to repentance\r\noccur. Two more tracts in something the same style--_Greene's Repentance_\r\nand _Greene's Vision_--followed. Their genuineness has been questioned, but\r\nseems to be fairly certain.\r\n\r\nThis full list--to which must be added the already mentioned _Pandosto, the\r\nTriumph of Time_, or _Dorastus and Fawnia_, and the translated _Debate\r\nbetween Folly and Love_--of a certainly not scanty life-work (Greene died\r\nwhen he was quite a young man, and wrote plays besides) has been given,\r\nbecause it is not only the earliest, but perhaps the most characteristic of\r\nthe whole. Despite the apparently unsuitable forms, it is evident that the\r\nwriter is striving, without knowing it, at what we call journalism. But\r\nfashion and the absence of models cramp and distort his work. Its main\r\nfeatures are to be found in the personal and satirical pieces, in the vivid\r\nand direct humanity of some touches in the euphuist tract-romances, in the\r\ndelightful snatches of verse which intersperse and relieve the\r\nheterogeneous erudition, the clumsy dialogue, and the rococo style. The two\r\nfollowing extracts give, the first a specimen of Greene's ornate and\r\nEuphuist style from _Orpharion_, the second a passage from his\r\nautobiographical or semi-autobiographical confessions in the _Groat's\r\nWorth_:--\r\n\r\n     \"I am Lydia that renowned Princess, whose never matched beauty\r\n     seemed like the gorgeous pomp of Phoebus, too bright for the day:\r\n     rung so strongly out of the trump of Fame as it filled every ear\r\n     with wonder: Daughter to Astolpho, the King of Lydia: who thought\r\n     himself not so fortunate for his diadem, sith other kings could\r\n     boast of crowns, nor for his great possessions, although endued\r\n     with large territories, as happy that he had a daughter whose\r\n     excellency in favour stained Venus, whose austere chastity set\r\n     Diana to silence with a blush. Know whatsoever thou art that\r\n     standest attentive to my tale, that the ruddiest rose in all\r\n     Damasco, the whitest lilies in the creeks of Danuby, might not if\r\n     they had united their native colours, but have bashed at the\r\n     vermilion stain, flourish'd upon the pure crystal of my face: the\r\n     Marguerites of the western Indies, counted more bright and rich\r\n     than that which Cleopatra quaffed to Anthony, the coral highest\r\n     in his pride upon the Afric shores, might well be graced to\r\n     resemble my teeth and lips, but never honoured to overreach my\r\n     pureness. Remaining thus the mirror of the world, and nature's\r\n     strangest miracle, there arrived in our Court a Thracian knight,\r\n     of personage tall, proportioned in most exquisite form, his face\r\n     but too fair for his qualities, for he was a brave and a resolute\r\n     soldier. This cavalier coming amongst divers others to see the\r\n     royalty of the state of Lydia, no sooner had a glance of my\r\n     beauty, but he set down his staff, resolving either to perish in\r\n     so sweet a labyrinth, or in time happily to stumble out with\r\n     Theseus. He had not stayed long in my father's court, but he\r\n     shewed such knightly deeds of chivalry amongst the nobility,\r\n     lightened with the extraordinary sparks of a courageous mind,\r\n     that not only he was liked and loved of all the chief peers of\r\n     the realms, but the report of his valour coming to my father's\r\n     ears, he was highly honoured of him, and placed in short time as\r\n     General of his warlike forces by land. Resting in this estimation\r\n     with the king, preferment was no means to quiet his mind, for\r\n     love had wounded so deep, as honour by no means might remedy,\r\n     that as the elephants can hardly be haled from the sight of the\r\n     waste, or the roe buck from gazing at red cloth, so there was no\r\n     object that could so much allure the wavering eyes of this\r\n     Thracian called Acestes, as the surpassing beauty of the Princess\r\n     Lydia, yea, so deeply he doted, that as the Chameleon gorgeth\r\n     herself with gazing into the air, so he fed his fancy with\r\n     staring on the heavenly face of his Goddess, so long dallying in\r\n     the flame, that he scorched his wings and in time consumed his\r\n     whole body. Being thus passionate, having none so familiar as he\r\n     durst make his confidant he fell thus to debate with himself.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"On the other side of the hedge sat one that heard his sorrow,\r\n     who getting over, came towards him, and brake off his passion.\r\n     When he approached, he saluted Roberto in this sort: Gentleman,\r\n     quoth he (for so you seem) I have by chance heard you discourse\r\n     some part of your grief; which appeareth to be more than you will\r\n     discover, or I can conceit. But if you vouchsafe such simple\r\n     comfort as my ability will yield, assure yourself, that I will\r\n     endeavour to do the best, that either may procure your profit, or\r\n     bring you pleasure: the rather, for that I suppose you are a\r\n     scholar, and pity it is men of learning should live in lack.\r\n\r\n     \"Roberto wondering to hear such good words, for that this iron\r\n     age affords few that esteem of virtue; returned him thankful\r\n     gratulations and (urged by necessity) uttered his present grief,\r\n     beseeching his advice how he might be employed. 'Why, easily,'\r\n     quoth he, 'and greatly to your benefit: for men of my profession\r\n     get by scholars their whole living.' 'What is your profession?'\r\n     said Roberto. 'Truly, sir,' said he, 'I am a player.' 'A player!'\r\n     quoth Roberto. 'I took you rather for a gentleman of great\r\n     living, for if by outward habit men should be censured, I tell\r\n     you, you would be taken for a substantial man.' 'So am I, where I\r\n     dwell' (quoth the player) 'reputed able, at my proper cost, to\r\n     build a windmill. What though the world once went hard with me,\r\n     when I was fain to carry my playing fardel a foot-back; _Tempora\r\n     mutantur_, I know you know the meaning of it better than I, but I\r\n     thus construe it; it is otherwise now; for my very share in\r\n     playing apparel will not be sold for two hundred pounds.' 'Truly'\r\n     (said Roberto) 'it is strange that you should so prosper in that\r\n     vain practise, for that it seems to me your voice is nothing\r\n     gracious.' 'Nay, then,' said the player, 'I mislike your\r\n     judgment: why, I am as famous for Delphrigas, and the King of\r\n     Fairies, as ever was any of my time. The twelve labours of\r\n     Hercules have I terribly thundered on the stage, and placed three\r\n     scenes of the devil on the highway to heaven.' 'Have ye so?'\r\n     (said Roberto) 'then I pray you, pardon me.' 'Nay more' (quoth\r\n     the player) 'I can serve to make a pretty speech, for I was a\r\n     country author, passing at a moral, for it was I that penn'd the\r\n     moral of man's wit, the Dialogue of Dives, and for seven years'\r\n     space was absolute interpreter of the puppets. But now my\r\n     Almanach is out of date.\r\n\r\n    The people make no estimation\r\n    Of morals teaching education.\r\n\r\n     Was not this pretty for a plain rhyme extempore? if ye will ye\r\n     shall have more.' 'Nay, it is enough,' said Roberto, 'but how\r\n     mean you to use me?' 'Why, sir, in making plays,' said the other,\r\n     'for which you shall be well paid, if you will take the pains.'\"\r\n\r\nThese same characteristics, though without the prevailing and in part\r\nobviously sincere melancholy which marks Greene's regrets, also distinguish\r\nLodge's prose work to such an extent that remarks on the two might\r\nsometimes be made simply interchangeable. But fortune was kinder to Lodge\r\nthan to his friend and collaborator. Nor does he seem to have had any\r\noccasion to \"tread the burning marl\" in company with conny-catchers and\r\ntheir associates. Lodge began with critical and polemical work--an academic\r\nif not very urbane reply to Stephen Gosson's _School of Abuse_; but in the\r\n_Alarum against Usurers_, which resembles and even preceded Greene's\r\nsimilar work, he took to the satirical-story-form. Indeed, the connection\r\nbetween Lodge and Greene was so close, and the difficulty of ascertaining\r\nthe exact dates of their compositions is so great, that it is impossible to\r\nbe sure which was the precise forerunner. Certainly if Lodge set Greene an\r\nexample in the _Alarum against Usurers_, he followed Greene's lead in\r\n_Forbonius and Prisceria_ some years afterwards, having written it on\r\nshipboard in a venture against the Spaniards. Lodge produced much the most\r\nfamous book of the euphuist school, next to _Euphues_ itself, as well as\r\nthe best known of this pamphlet series, in _Rosalynde_ or _Euphues' Golden\r\nLegacy_, from which Shakespere took the story of _As You Like It_, and of\r\nwhich an example follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"'Ah Phoebe,' quoth he, 'whereof art thou made, that thou\r\n     regardest not thy malady? Am I so hateful an object, that thine\r\n     eyes condemn me for an abject? or so base, that thy desires\r\n     cannot stoop so low as to lend me a gracious look? My passions\r\n     are many, my loves more, my thoughts loyalty, and my fancy faith:\r\n     all devoted in humble devoir to the service of Phoebe; and shall\r\n     I reap no reward for such fealties? The swain's daily labours is\r\n     quit with the evening's hire, the ploughman's toil is eased with\r\n     the hope of corn, what the ox sweats out at the plough he\r\n     fatteneth at the crib: but unfortunate Montanus[39] hath no salve\r\n     for his sorrows, nor any hope of recompense for the hazard of his\r\n     perplexed passions. If Phoebe, time may plead the proof of my\r\n     truth, twice seven winters have I loved fair Phoebe: if constancy\r\n     be a cause to further my suit, Montanus' thoughts have been\r\n     sealed in the sweet of Phoebe's excellence, as far from change as\r\n     she from love: if outward passions may discover inward\r\n     affections, the furrows in my face may discover the sorrows of my\r\n     heart, and the map of my looks the grief of my mind. Thou seest\r\n     (Phoebe) the tears of despair have made my cheeks full of\r\n     wrinkles, and my scalding sighs have made the air echo her pity\r\n     conceived in my plaints; Philomel hearing my passions, hath left\r\n     her mournful tunes to listen to the discourse of miseries. I have\r\n     portrayed in every tree the beauty of my mistress, and the\r\n     despair of my loves. What is it in the woods cannot witness my\r\n     woes? and who is it would not pity my plaints? only Phoebe. And\r\n     why? Because I am Montanus, and she Phoebe: I a worthless swain,\r\n     and she the most excellent of all fairies. Beautiful Phoebe! oh\r\n     might I say pitiful, then happy were I though I tasted but one\r\n     minute of that good hap. Measure Montanus, not by his fortunes,\r\n     but by his loves, and balance not his wealth but his desires, and\r\n     lend but one gracious look to cure a heap of disquieted cares: if\r\n     not, ah if Phoebe cannot love, let a storm of frowns end the\r\n     discontent of my thoughts, and so let me perish in my desires,\r\n     because they are above my deserts: only at my death this favour\r\n     cannot be denied me, that all shall say Montanus died for love of\r\n     hard hearted Phoebe.' At these words she filled her face full of\r\n     frowns and made him this short and sharp reply.\r\n\r\n     \"'Importunate shepherd, whose loves are lawless because restless:\r\n     are thy passions so extreme, that thou canst not conceal them\r\n     with patience? or art thou so folly-sick, that thou must needs be\r\n     fancy-sick, and in thy affection tied to such an exigent as none\r\n     serves but Phoebe? Well, sir, if your market can be made nowhere\r\n     else, home again, for your mart is at the fairest. Phoebe is no\r\n     lettuce for your lips, and her grapes hang so high, that gaze at\r\n     them you may, but touch them you cannot. Yet Montanus I speak not\r\n     this in pride, but in disdain: not that I scorn thee, but that I\r\n     hate love: for I count it as great honour to triumph over fancy\r\n     as over fortune. Rest thee content therefore Montanus, cease from\r\n     thy loves, and bridle thy looks, quench the sparkles before they\r\n     grow to a farther flame; for in loving me, thou shalt but live by\r\n     loss, and what thou utterest in words are all written in the\r\n     wind. Wert thou (Montanus) as fair as Paris, as hardy as Hector,\r\n     as constant as Troilus, as loving as Leander, Phoebe could not\r\n     love, because she cannot love at all: and therefore if thou\r\n     pursue me with Phoebus, I must flie with Daphne.'\"\r\n\r\n[39] The Silvius, it may be just necessary to observe, of _As You Like It_.\r\n\r\nThis book seems to have been very successful, and Lodge began to write\r\npamphlets vigorously, sometimes taking up the social satire, sometimes the\r\nmoral treatise, sometimes (and then most happily) the euphuist romance,\r\nsalted with charming poems. His last prose work in this kind (he wrote\r\nother things later) was the pretty and prettily-named _Margarite of\r\nAmerica_, in 1596.\r\n\r\nThe names of Nash and Harvey are intertwined even more closely than those\r\nof Greene and Lodge; but the conjunction is not a grasp of friendship but a\r\ngrip of hatred--a wrestle, not an embrace. The fact of the quarrel has\r\nattracted rather disproportionate attention from the days of Isaac Disraeli\r\nonwards; and its original cause is still extremely obscure and very\r\nunimportant. By some it is connected, causally as well as accidentally,\r\nwith the Martin Marprelate business; by some with the fact that Harvey\r\nbelonged to the inner Sidneian clique, Nash to the outer ring of\r\nprofessional journalists and Bohemians. It at any rate produced some\r\nremarkable varieties of the pamphlet, and demonstrated the keen interest\r\nwhich the world takes in the proceedings of any couple of literary men who\r\nchoose to abuse and befoul one another. Harvey, though no mean scholar,\r\nwas in mere writing no match for Nash; and his chief answer to the latter,\r\n_Pierce's Supererogation_, is about as rambling, incoherent, and\r\nineffective a combination of pedantry and insolence as need be wished for.\r\nIt has some not uninteresting, though usually very obscure, hints on\r\nliterary matters. Besides this, Harvey wrote letters to Spenser with their\r\nwell-known criticism and recommendation of classical forms, and _Foure\r\nLetters Touching Robert Greene and Others: with the Trimming of Thomas\r\nNash, Gentleman_. A sample of him, not in his abusive-dull, but in his\r\nscholarly-dull manner, may be given:--\r\n\r\n     \"Mine own rules and precepts of art, I believe will fall out not\r\n     greatly repugnant, though peradventure somewhat different: and\r\n     yet I am not so resolute, but I can be content to reserve the\r\n     copying out and publishing thereof, until I have a little better\r\n     consulted with my pillow, and taken some further advice of Madame\r\n     Sperienza. In the mean time, take this for a general caveat, and\r\n     say I have revealed one great mystery unto you: I am of opinion,\r\n     there is no one more regular and justifiable direction, either\r\n     for the assured and infallible certainty of our English\r\n     artificial prosody particularly, or generally to bring our\r\n     language into art, and to frame a grammar or rhetoric thereof;\r\n     than first of all universally to agree upon one and the same\r\n     orthography in all points conformable and proportionate to our\r\n     common natural prosody: whether Sir Thomas Smithies in that\r\n     respect be the most perfit, as surely it must needs be very good;\r\n     or else some other of profounder learning and longer experience,\r\n     than Sir Thomas was, shewing by necessary demonstration, wherein\r\n     he is defective, will undertake shortly to supply his wants and\r\n     make him more absolute. Myself dare not hope to hop after him,\r\n     till I see something or other, to or fro, publicly and\r\n     authentically established, as it were by a general council, or\r\n     Act of Parliament: and then peradventure, standing upon firmer\r\n     ground, for company sake, I may adventure to do as others do.\r\n     _Interim_, credit me, I dare give no precepts, nor set down any\r\n     certain general art: and yet see my boldness, I am not greatly\r\n     squeamish of my _Particular Examples_, whereas he that can but\r\n     reasonably skill of the one, will give easily a shrewd guess at\r\n     the other: considering that the one fetcheth his original and\r\n     offspring from the other. In which respect, to say troth, we\r\n     beginners have the start, and advantage of our followers, who are\r\n     to frame and conform both their examples and precepts, according\r\n     to precedent which they have of us: as no doubt Homer or some\r\n     other in Greek, and Ennius, or I know not who else in Latin, did\r\n     prejudice, and overrule those that followed them, as well for\r\n     the quantities of syllables, as number of feet, and the like:\r\n     their only examples going for current payment, and standing\r\n     instead of laws, and rules with the posterity.\"\r\n\r\nIn Harvey, more perhaps than anywhere else in prose, appears the abusive\r\nexaggeration, not humorous or Rabelaisian, but simply rancorous and dull,\r\nwhich mars so much Elizabethan work. In order not to fall into the same\r\nerror ourselves, we must abstain from repeating the very strong language\r\nwhich has sometimes been applied to his treatment of dead men, and such\r\ndead men as Greene and Marlowe, for apparently no other fault than their\r\nbeing friends of his enemy Nash. It is sufficient to say that Harvey had\r\nall the worst traits of \"donnishness,\" without having apparently any notion\r\nof that dignity which sometimes half excuses the don. He was emphatically\r\nof Mr. Carlyle's \"acrid-quack\" genus.\r\n\r\nThomas Nash will himself hardly escape the charge of acridity, but only\r\ninjustice or want of discernment will call him a quack. Unlike Harvey, but\r\nlike Greene and Lodge, he was a verse as well as a prose writer. But his\r\nverse is in comparison unimportant. Nor was he tempted to intersperse\r\nspecimens of it in his prose work. The absolutely best part of that\r\nwork--the Anti-Martinist pamphlets to be noticed presently--is only\r\nattributed to him conjecturally, though the grounds of attribution are very\r\nstrong. But his characteristics are fully evident in his undoubted\r\nproductions. The first of these in pamphlet form is the very odd thing\r\ncalled _Pierce Penniless_ [the name by which Nash became known], _his\r\nSupplication to the Devil_. It is a kind of rambling condemnation of\r\nluxury, for the most part delivered in the form of burlesque exhortation,\r\nwhich the mediaeval _sermons joyeux_ had made familiar in all European\r\ncountries. Probably some allusions in this refer to Harvey, whose\r\npragmatical pedantry may have in many ways annoyed Nash, a Cambridge man\r\nlike himself. At any rate the two soon plunged into a regular battle, the\r\ndocuments of which on Nash's side are, first a prognostication, something\r\nin the style of Rabelais, then a formal confutation of the _Four Letters_,\r\nand then the famous lampoon entitled _Have with you to Saffron Walden_\r\n[Harvey's birthplace], of which here is a specimen:--\r\n\r\n     \"His father he undid to furnish him to the Court once more, where\r\n     presenting himself in all the colours of the rainbow, and a pair\r\n     of moustaches like a black horse tail tied up in a knot, with two\r\n     tufts sticking out on each side, he was asked by no mean\r\n     personage, _Unde haec insania_? whence proceedeth this folly or\r\n     madness? and he replied with that weather-beaten piece of a verse\r\n     out of the Grammar, _Semel insanivimus omnes_, once in our days\r\n     there is none of us but have played the idiots; and so was he\r\n     counted and bade stand by for a Nodgscomb. He that most\r\n     patronized him, prying more searchingly into him, and finding\r\n     that he was more meet to make sport with than any way deeply to\r\n     be employed, with fair words shook him off, and told him he was\r\n     fitter for the University, than for the Court or his turn, and so\r\n     bade God prosper his studies, and sent for another Secretary to\r\n     Oxford.\r\n\r\n     \"Readers, be merry; for in me there shall want nothing I can do\r\n     to make you merry. You see I have brought the Doctor out of\r\n     request at Court, and it shall cost me a fall, but I will get him\r\n     hooted out of the University too, ere I give him over. What will\r\n     you give me when I bring him upon the Stage in one of the\r\n     principalest Colleges in Cambridge? Lay any wager with me, and I\r\n     will; or if you lay no wager at all, I'll fetch him aloft in\r\n     Pedantius, that exquisite Comedy in Trinity College; where under\r\n     the chief part, from which it took his name, as namely the\r\n     concise and firking finicaldo fine School master, he was full\r\n     drawn and delineated from the sole of his foot to the crown of\r\n     his head. The just manner of his phrase in his Orations and\r\n     Disputations they stuffed his mouth with, and no Buffianism\r\n     throughout his whole books, but they bolstered out his part with;\r\n     as those ragged remnants in his four familiar epistles 'twixt him\r\n     and _Senior Immerito, raptim scripta, noste manum et stylum_,\r\n     with innumerable other of his rabble-routs: and scoffing his\r\n     _Musarum Lachrymae_ with _Flebo amorem meum etiam musarum\r\n     lachrymis_; which, to give it his due, was a more collachrymate\r\n     wretched Treatise than my _Piers Penniless_, being the pitifulest\r\n     pangs that ever any man's Muse breathed forth. I leave out half;\r\n     not the carrying up of his gown, his nice gait on his pantoffles,\r\n     or the affected accent of his speech, but they personated. And if\r\n     I should reveal all, I think they borrowed his gown to play the\r\n     part in, the more to flout him. Let him deny this (and not damn\r\n     himself) for his life if he can. Let him deny that there was a\r\n     Shew made at Clare Hall of him and his two brothers, called,\r\n\r\n        \"_Tarra, rantantara turba tumultuosa Trigonum\r\n        Tri-Harveyorum Tri-harmonia_\r\n\r\n     Let him deny that there was another Shew made of the little\r\n     Minnow his brother, _Dodrans Dick_, at Peter-house called,\r\n\r\n        \"_Duns furens._ Dick Harvey in a frensy.\r\n\r\n     Whereupon Dick came and broke the College glass windows; and\r\n     Doctor Perne (being then either for himself or deputy\r\n     Vice-Chancellor) caused him to be fetched in, and set in the\r\n     Stocks till the Shew was ended, and a great part of the night\r\n     after.\"\r\n\r\n_The Terrors of the Night_, a discourse of apparitions, for once, among\r\nthese oddly-named pieces, tells a plain story. Its successor, _Christ's\r\nTears over Jerusalem_, Nash's longest book, is one of those rather\r\nenigmatical expressions of repentance for loose life which were so common\r\nat the time, and which, according to the charity of the reader, may be\r\nattributed to real feeling, to a temporary access of _Katzen-jammer_, or to\r\ndownright hypocrisy, bent only on manufacturing profitable \"copy,\" and\r\nvarying its style to catch different tastes. The most unfavourable\r\nhypothesis is probably unjust, and a certain tone of sincerity also runs\r\nthrough the next book, _The Unfortunate Traveller_, in which Nash, like\r\nmany others, inveighs against the practice of sending young Englishmen to\r\nbe corrupted abroad. It is noteworthy that this (the place of which in the\r\nhistory of the novel has been rather exaggerated) is the oldest authority\r\nfor the romance of Surrey and Geraldine; but it is uncertain whether this\r\nwas pure invention on Nash's part or not. Nash's _Lenten Stuff_ is very\r\ninteresting, being a panegyric on Great Yarmouth and its famous staple\r\ncommodity (though Nash was actually born at Lowestoft).\r\n\r\nIn Nash's work we find a style both of treatment and language entirely\r\ndifferent from anything of Greene's or Lodge's. He has no euphuism, his\r\nforte being either extravagant burlesque (in which the influence of\r\nRabelais is pretty directly perceptible, while he himself acknowledges\r\nindebtedness to some other sources, such as Bullen or Bullein, a dialogue\r\nwriter of the preceding generation), or else personal attack, boisterous\r\nand unscrupulous, but often most vigorous and effective. Diffuseness and\r\nwant of keeping to the point too frequently mar Nash's work; but when he\r\nshakes himself free from them, and goes straight for his enemy or his\r\nsubject, he is a singularly forcible writer. In his case more than in any\r\nof the others, the journalist born out of due time is perceptible. He had\r\nperhaps not much original message for the world. But he had eminently the\r\ntrick both of damaging controversial argument made light to catch the\r\npopular taste, and of easy discussion or narrative. The chief defects of\r\nhis work would probably have disappeared of themselves if he had had to\r\nwrite not pamphlets, but articles. He did, however, what he could; and he\r\nis worthy of a place in the history of literature if only for the sake of\r\n_Have with you to Saffron Walden_--the best example of its own kind to be\r\nfound before the end of the seventeenth century, if not the beginning of\r\nthe eighteenth.\r\n\r\nThomas Dekker was much less of a born prose writer than his half-namesake,\r\nNash. His best work, unlike Nash's, was done in verse, and, while he was\r\nfar Nash's superior, not merely in poetical expression but in creative\r\ngrasp of character, he was entirely destitute of Nash's incisive and direct\r\nfaculty of invective. Nevertheless his work, too, is memorable among the\r\nprose work of the time, and for special reasons. His first pamphlet\r\n(according to the peculiarity already noted in Rowlands's case) is not\r\nprose at all, but verse--yet not the verse of which Dekker had real\r\nmastery, being a very lamentable ballad of the destruction of Jerusalem,\r\nentitled _Canaan's Calamity_ (1598). The next, _The Wonderful Year_, is the\r\naccount of London in plague time, and has at least the interest of being\r\ncomparable with, and perhaps that of having to some extent inspired,\r\nDefoe's famous performance. Then, and of the same date, follows a very\r\ncurious piece, the foreign origin of which has not been so generally\r\nnoticed as that of Dekker's most famous prose production. _The Bachelor's\r\nBanquet_ is in effect only a free rendering of the immortal fifteenth\r\ncentury satire, assigned on no very solid evidence to Antoine de la Salle,\r\nthe _Quinze Joyes de Mariage_, the resemblance being kept down to the\r\nrecurrence at the end of each section of the same phrase, \"in Lob's\r\npound,\" which reproduces the less grotesque \"dans la nasse\" of the\r\noriginal. But here, as later, the skill with which Dekker adapts and brings\r\nin telling circumstances appropriate to his own day deserves every\r\nacknowledgment. _Dekker's Dreame_ is chiefly verse and chiefly pious; and\r\nthen at a date somewhat later than that of our present period, but\r\nconnected with it by the fact of authorship, begins a very interesting\r\nseries of pieces, more vivid if somewhat less well written than Greene's,\r\nand connected with his \"conny-catching\" course. _The Bellman of London_,\r\n_Lanthorn and Candlelight_, _A Strange Horse-Race_, _The Seven Deadly Sins\r\nof London_, _News from Hell_, _The Double P.P._, and _The Gull's Hornbook_,\r\nare all pamphlets of this class; the chief interest resting in _News from\r\nHell_ (which, according to the author's scheme, connects itself with Nash's\r\n_Pierce Penniless_, and is the devil's answer thereto) and _The Gull's\r\nHornbook_ (1609). This last, the best known of Dekker's work, is an\r\nEnglishing of the no less famous _Grobianus_ of Frederick Dedekind, and the\r\nsame skill of adaptation which was noticed in _The Bachelor's Banquet_ is\r\nobservable here. The spirit of these works seems to have been so popular\r\nthat Dekker kept it up in _The Dead Term_ [long vacation], _Work for\r\nArmourers_ (which, however, is less particular and connects itself with\r\nNash's sententious work), _The Raven's Almanack_, and _A Rod for Runaways_\r\n(1625). _The Four Birds of Noah's Ark_, which Dr. Grosart prints last, is\r\nof a totally different character, being purely a book of piety. It is thus\r\ninferior in interest to the series dealing with the low life of London,\r\nwhich contains most curious studies of the ancient order of ragamuffins (as\r\na modern satirist has pleasantly called them), and bears altogether marks\r\nof greater sincerity than the parallel studies of other writers. For about\r\nDekker, hack and penny-a-liner as he undoubtedly was, there was a\r\nsimplicity, a truth to nature, and at the same time a faculty of dramatic\r\npresentation in which Greene, Lodge, and Nash were wholly wanting; and his\r\nprose pamphlets smack of these good gifts in their measure as much as _The\r\nHonest Whore_. Indeed, on the whole, he seems to be the most trustworthy\r\nof these chroniclers of the English picaroons; and one feels disposed to\r\nbelieve that if the things which he tells did not actually happen,\r\nsomething very like them was probably happening every day in London during\r\nthe time of \"Eliza and our James.\" For the time of Eliza and our James was\r\nby no means a wholly heroic period, and it only loses, not gains, by the\r\nfiction that every man of letters was a Spenser and every man of affairs a\r\nSidney or even a Raleigh. Extracts from _The Seven Deadly Sins_ and _The\r\nGull's Hornbook_ may be given:--\r\n\r\n     \"O Candle-light! and art thou one of the cursed crew? hast thou\r\n     been set at the table of Princes and Noblemen? have all sorts of\r\n     people done reverence unto thee, and stood bare so soon as ever\r\n     they have seen thee? have thieves, traitors, and murderers been\r\n     afraid to come in thy presence, because they knew thee just, and\r\n     that thou wouldest discover them? And art thou now a harbourer of\r\n     all kinds of vices? nay, dost thou play the capital Vice thyself?\r\n     Hast thou had so many learned Lectures read before thee, and is\r\n     the light of thy understanding now clean put out, and have so\r\n     many profound scholars profited by thee? hast thou done such good\r\n     to Universities, been such a guide to the lame, and seen the\r\n     doing of so many good works, yet dost thou now look dimly, and\r\n     with a dull eye, upon all goodness? What comfort have sick men\r\n     taken (in weary and irksome nights) but only in thee? thou hast\r\n     been their physician and apothecary, and when the relish of\r\n     nothing could please them, the very shadow of thee hath been to\r\n     them a restorative consolation. The nurse hath stilled her\r\n     wayward infant, shewing it but to thee: What gladness hast thou\r\n     put into mariners' bosoms when thou hast met them on the sea!\r\n     What joy into the faint and benighted traveller when he has met\r\n     thee on the land! How many poor handicraftsmen by thee have\r\n     earned the best part of their living! And art thou now become a\r\n     companion for drunkards, for leachers, and for prodigals? Art\r\n     thou turned reprobate? thou wilt burn for it in hell. And so\r\n     odious is this thy apostasy, and hiding thyself from the light of\r\n     the truth, that at thy death and going out of the world, even\r\n     they that love thee best will tread thee under their feet: yea, I\r\n     that have thus played the herald, and proclaimed thy good parts,\r\n     will now play the crier and call thee into open court, to arraign\r\n     thee for thy misdemeanours.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"For do but consider what an excellent thing sleep is: it is so\r\n     inestimable a jewel that, if a tyrant would give his crown for an\r\n     hour's slumber, it cannot be bought: of so beautiful a shape is\r\n     it, that though a man lie with an Empress, his heart cannot be at\r\n     quiet till he leaves her embracements to be at rest with the\r\n     other: yea, so greatly indebted are we to this kinsman of death,\r\n     that we owe the better tributary, half of our life to him: and\r\n     there is good cause why we should do so: for sleep is that golden\r\n     chain that ties health and our bodies together. Who complains of\r\n     want? of wounds? of cares? of great men's oppressions? of\r\n     captivity? whilst he sleepeth? Beggars in their beds take as much\r\n     pleasure as kings: can we therefore surfeit on this delicate\r\n     Ambrosia? can we drink too much of that whereof to taste too\r\n     little tumbles us into a churchyard, and to use it but\r\n     indifferently throws us into Bedlam? No, no, look upon Endymion,\r\n     the moon's minion, who slept three score and fifteen years, and\r\n     was not a hair the worse for it. Can lying abed till noon (being\r\n     not the three score and fifteenth thousand part of his nap) be\r\n     hurtful?\r\n\r\n     \"Besides, by the opinion of all philosophers and physicians, it\r\n     is not good to trust the air with our bodies till the sun with\r\n     his flame-coloured wings hath fanned away the misty smoke of the\r\n     morning, and refined that thick tobacco-breath which the\r\n     rheumatic night throws abroad of purpose to put out the eye of\r\n     the element: which work questionless cannot be perfectly finished\r\n     till the sun's car-horses stand prancing on the very top of\r\n     highest noon: so that then (and not till then) is the most\r\n     healthful hour to be stirring. Do you require examples to\r\n     persuade you? At what time do Lords and Ladies use to rise but\r\n     then? Your simpering merchants' wives are the fairest lyers in\r\n     the world: and is not eleven o'clock their common hour? they find\r\n     (no doubt) unspeakable sweetness in such lying, else they would\r\n     not day by day put it so in practice. In a word, mid-day slumbers\r\n     are golden; they make the body fat, the skin fair, the flesh\r\n     plump, delicate and tender; they set a russet colour on the\r\n     cheeks of young women, and make lusty courage to rise up in men;\r\n     they make us thrifty, both in sparing victuals (for breakfasts\r\n     thereby are saved from the hell-mouth of the belly) and in\r\n     preserving apparel; for while we warm us in our beds our clothes\r\n     are not worn.\r\n\r\n     \"The casements of thine eyes being then at this commendable time\r\n     of the day newly set open, choose rather to have thy wind-pipe\r\n     cut in pieces than to salute any man. Bid not good-morrow so much\r\n     as to thy father, though he be an emperor. An idle ceremony it is\r\n     and can do him little good; to thyself it may bring much harm:\r\n     for if he be a wise man that knows how to hold his peace, of\r\n     necessity must he be counted a fool that cannot keep his tongue.\"\r\n\r\nThe voluminous work in pamphlet kind of Nicholas Breton, still more the\r\nverse efforts closely akin to it of Samuel Rowlands, John Davies of\r\nHereford and some others, must be passed over with very brief notice. Dr.\r\nGrosart's elaborate edition of the first-named has given a vast mass of\r\nmatter very interesting to the student of literature, but which cannot be\r\nhonestly recommended to the general reader. Breton, whose long life and\r\nperpetual literary activity fill up great part of our whole period, was an\r\nEssex gentleman of a good family (a fact which he never forgot), and\r\napparently for some time a dependent of the well-known Countess of\r\nPembroke, Sidney's sister. A much older man than most of the great wits of\r\nElizabeth's reign, he also survived most of them, and his publications, if\r\nnot his composition, cover a full half century, though he was _nel mezzo\r\ndel cammin_ at the date of the earliest. He was probably born some years\r\nbefore the middle of the sixteenth century, and certainly did not die\r\nbefore the first year of Charles I. If we could take as his the charming\r\nlullaby of _The Arbour of Amorous Devices_ he would stand (if only as a\r\nkind of \"single-speech\") high as a poet. But I fear that Dr. Grosart's\r\nattribution of it to him is based on little external and refuted by all\r\ninternal evidence. His best certain thing is the pretty \"Phillida and\r\nCorydon\" idyll, which may be found in _England's Helicon_ or in Mr. Ward's\r\n_Poets_. But I own that I can never read this latter without thinking of\r\ntwo lines of Fulke Greville's in the same metre and on no very different\r\ntheme--\r\n\r\n    \"O'er enamelled meads they went,\r\n    Quiet she, he passion-rent,\"\r\n\r\nwhich are simply worth all the works of Breton, prose and verse, unless we\r\ncount the _Lullaby_, put together. In the _mots rayonnants_, the _mots de\r\nlumiere_, he is sadly deficient. But his work (which is nearly as plentiful\r\nin verse as in prose) is, as has been said, very interesting to the\r\nliterary student, because it shows better perhaps than anything else the\r\nstyle of literature which a man, disdaining to condescend to burlesque or\r\nbawdry, not gifted with any extraordinary talent, either at prose or verse,\r\nbut possessed of a certain literary faculty, could then produce with a fair\r\nchance of being published and bought. It cannot be said that the result\r\nshows great daintiness in Breton's public. The verse, with an improvement\r\nin sweetness and fluency, is very much of the doggerel style which was\r\nprevalent before Spenser; and the prose, though showing considerable\r\nfaculty, if not of invention, yet of adroit imitation of previously\r\ninvented styles, is devoid of distinction and point. There are, however,\r\nexercises after Breton's own fashion in almost every popular style of the\r\ntime--euphuist romances, moral treatises, packets of letters, collections\r\nof jests and short tales, purely religious tractates, characters (after the\r\nstyle later illustrated by Overbury and Earle), dialogues, maxims, pictures\r\nof manners, collections of notes about foreign countries,--in fact, the\r\nwhole farrago of the modern periodical. The pervading characteristics are\r\nBreton's invariable modesty, his pious and, if I may be permitted to use\r\nthe word, gentlemanly spirit, and a fashion of writing which, if not very\r\npointed, picturesque, or epigrammatic, is clear, easy, and on the whole\r\nrather superior, in observance of the laws of grammar and arrangement, to\r\nthe work of men of much greater note in his day.\r\n\r\nThe verse pamphlets of Rowlands (whom I have not studied as thoroughly as\r\nmost others), Davies, and many less voluminous men, are placed here with\r\nall due apology for the liberty. They are seldom or never of much formal\r\nmerit, but they are interesting, first, because they testify to the hold\r\nwhich the mediaeval conception of verse, as a general literary medium as\r\nsuitable as prose and more attractive, had upon men even at this late time;\r\nand secondly, because, like the purely prose pamphlets, they are full of\r\ninformation as to the manners of the time. For Rowlands I may refer to Mr.\r\nGosse's essay. John Davies of Hereford, the writing-master, though he has\r\nbeen carefully edited for students, and is by no means unworthy of study,\r\nhas had less benefit of exposition to the general reader. He was not a\r\ngenius, but he is a good example of the rather dull man who, despite the\r\ndisfavour of circumstance, contrives by much assiduity and ingenious\r\nfollowing of models to attain a certain position in literature. There are\r\nJohn Davieses of Hereford in every age, but since the invention and filing\r\nof newspapers their individuality has been not a little merged. The\r\nanonymous journalist of our days is simply to the historian such and such\r\na paper, volume so-and-so, page so much, column this or that. The good John\r\nDavies, living in another age, still stands as _nominis umbra_, but with a\r\nnot inconsiderable body of work to throw the shadow.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable, and certainly one of not the least interesting\r\ndevelopments of the Elizabethan pamphlet remains to be noticed. This is the\r\ncelebrated series of \"Martin Marprelate\" tracts, with the replies which\r\nthey called forth. Indeed the popularity of this series may be said to have\r\ngiven a great impulse to the whole pamphleteering system. It is somewhat\r\nunfortunate that this interesting subject has never been taken up in full\r\nby a dispassionate historian of literature, sufficiently versed in politics\r\nand in theology. In mid-nineteenth century most, but by no means all of the\r\nmore notable tracts were reprinted by John Petheram, a London bookseller,\r\nwhose productions have since been issued under the well-known imprint of\r\nJohn Russell Smith, the publisher of the _Library of Old Authors_. This\r\ngave occasion to a review in _The Christian Remembrancer_, afterwards\r\nenlarged and printed as a book by Mr. Maskell, a High Churchman who\r\nsubsequently seceded to the Church of Rome. This latter accident has rather\r\nunfavourably and unfairly affected later judgments of his work, which,\r\nhowever, is certainly not free from party bias. It has scarcely been less\r\nunlucky that the chief recent dealers with the matter, Professor Arber (who\r\nprojected a valuable reprint of the whole series in his _English Scholars'\r\nLibrary_, and who prefaced it with a quite invaluable introductory sketch),\r\nand Dr. Grosart, who also included divers Anti-Martinist tracts in his\r\nprivately printed _Works of Nashe_, are very strongly prejudiced on the\r\nPuritan side.[40] Between these authorities the dispassionate inquirer who\r\nattacks the texts for himself is likely to feel somewhat in the position of\r\na man who exposes himself to a cross fire. The Martin Marprelate\r\ncontroversy, looked at without prejudice but with sufficient information,\r\nshows itself as a very early example of the reckless violence of private\r\ncrotcheteers on the one hand, and of the rather considerable unwisdom of\r\nthe official defenders of order on the other. \"Martin's\" method was to a\r\ncertain extent an anticipation of the famous move by which Pascal, fifty\r\nyears later, \"took theology out of the schools into drawing-rooms,\" except\r\nthat Martin and his adversaries transferred the venue rather to the\r\ntap-room than to the drawing-room. The controversy between the framers of\r\nthe Church of England in its present state, and the hot gospellers who,\r\nwith Thomas Cartwright at their head, denied the proposition (not deniable\r\nor denied now by any sane and scholarly disputant) that church discipline\r\nand government are points left to a great extent undefined in the\r\nScriptures, had gone on for years before Martin appeared. Cartwright and\r\nWhitgift had fought, with a certain advantage of warmth and eloquence on\r\nCartwright's side, and with an immense preponderance of logical cogency on\r\nWhitgift's. Many minor persons had joined in the struggle, and at last a\r\ndivine, more worthy than wise, John Bridges, Dean of Salisbury, had\r\nproduced on the orthodox side one of those enormous treatises (it had some\r\nfifteen hundred quarto pages) which are usually left unread by the side\r\nthey favour, and which exasperate the side they oppose. The ordinary law of\r\nthe time, moreover, which placed large powers in the hands of the bishops,\r\nand especially entrusted them with a rigid and complete censorship of the\r\npress, had begun to be put in force severely against the more outspoken\r\npartisans. Any one who will take the trouble to read the examination of\r\nHenry Barrow, which Mr. Arber has reprinted,[41] or even the \"moderate\"\r\ntracts of Nicholas Udall, which in a manner ushered in the Marprelate\r\ncontroversy, will probably be more surprised at the long-suffering of the\r\njudges than at the sufferings of their prisoners. Barrow, in a long and\r\npatient examination before the council, of which the Bishop of London and\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury were members, called them to their faces the\r\none a \"wolf,\" a \"bloody persecutor,\" and an \"apostate,\" the other \"a\r\nmonster\" and \"the second beast that is spoken of in the Revelations.\" The\r\n\"moderate\" Udall, after publishing a dialogue (in which an Anglican bishop\r\ncalled Diotrephes is represented, among other things, as planning measures\r\nagainst the Puritans in consort with a papist and an usurer), further\r\ncomposed a _Demonstration of Discipline_ in which, writing, according to\r\nMr. Arber, \"without any satire or invective,\" he calls the bishops merely\r\n_qua_ bishops, \"the wretched fathers of a filthy mother,\" with abundant\r\nepithets to match, and rains down on every practice of the existing church\r\ngovernment such terms as \"blasphemous,\" \"damnable,\" \"hellish,\" and the\r\nlike. To the modern reader who looks at these things with the eyes of the\r\npresent day, it may of course seem that it would have been wiser to let the\r\ndogs bark. But that was not the principle of the time: and as Mr. Arber\r\nmost frankly admits, it was certainly not the principle of the dogs\r\nthemselves. The Puritans claimed for themselves a not less absolute right\r\nto call in the secular arm if they could, and a much more absolute\r\ncertainty and righteousness for their tenets than the very hottest of their\r\nadversaries.\r\n\r\n[40] This prejudice is naturally still stronger in some American writers,\r\nnotably Dr. Dexter.\r\n\r\n[41] Arber, _Introductory Sketch_. p. 40 _sqq._ All the quotations and\r\nreferences which follow will be found in Arber's and Petheram's reprints or\r\nin Grosart's _Nash_, vol. 1. If the works cited are not given as wholes in\r\nthem, the fact will be noted. (See also Mr. Bond's _Lyly_.)\r\n\r\nUdall was directly, as well as indirectly, the begetter of the Martin\r\nMarprelate controversy: though after he got into trouble in connection with\r\nit, he made a sufficiently distinct expression of disapproval of the\r\nMartinist methods, and it seems to have been due more to accident and his\r\nown obstinacy than anything else that he died in prison instead of being\r\nobliged with the honourable banishment of a Guinea chaplaincy. His printer,\r\nWaldegrave, had had his press seized and his license withdrawn for\r\n_Diotrephes_, and resentment at this threw what, in the existing\r\narrangements of censorship and the Stationers' monopoly, was a very\r\ndifficult thing to obtain--command of a practical printer--into the hands\r\nof the malcontents. Chief among these malcontents was a certain Reverend\r\nJohn Penry, a Welshman by birth, a member, as was then not uncommon, of\r\nboth universities, and the author, among other more dubious publications,\r\nof a plea, intemperately stated in parts, but very sober and sensible at\r\nbottom, for a change in the system of allotting and administering the\r\nbenefices of the church in Wales. Which plea, be it observed in passing,\r\nhad it been attended to, it would have been better for both the church and\r\nstate of England at this day. The pamphlet[42] contained, however, a\r\ndistinct insinuation against the Queen, of designedly keeping Wales in\r\nignorance and subjection--an insinuation which, in those days, was\r\nequivalent to high treason. The book was seized, and the author imprisoned\r\n(1587). Now when, about a year after, and in the very height of the danger\r\nfrom the Armada, Waldegrave's livelihood was threatened by the proceedings\r\nabove referred to, it would appear that he obtained from the Continent, or\r\nhad previously secreted from his confiscated stock, printing tools, and\r\nthat he and Penry, at the house of Mistress Crane, at East Molesey, in\r\nSurrey, printed a certain tract, called, for shortness, \"The Epistle.\"[43]\r\nThis tract, of the authorship and character of which more presently,\r\ncreated a great sensation. It was immediately followed, the press being\r\nshifted for safety to the houses of divers Puritan country gentlemen, by\r\nthe promised _Epitome_. So great was the stir, that a formal answer of\r\ngreat length was put forth by \"T. C.\" (well known to be Thomas Cooper,\r\nBishop of Winchester), entitled, _An Admonition to the People of England_.\r\nThe Martinists, from their invisible and shifting citadel, replied with\r\nperhaps the cleverest tract of the whole controversy, named, with\r\ndeliberate quaintness, _Hay any Work for Cooper?_[44] (\"Have You any Work\r\nfor the Cooper?\" said to be an actual trade London cry). Thenceforward the\r\n_melee_ of pamphlets, answers, \"replies, duplies, quadruplies,\" became in\r\nsmall space indescribable. Petheram's prospectus of reprints (only\r\npartially carried out) enumerates twenty-six, almost all printed in the\r\nthree years 1588-1590; Mr. Arber, including preliminary works, counts some\r\nthirty. The perambulating press was once seized (at Newton Lane, near\r\nManchester), but Martin was not silenced. It is certain (though there are\r\nno remnants extant of the matter concerned) that Martin was brought on the\r\nstage in some form or other, and though the duration of the controversy was\r\nas short as its character was hot, it was rather suppressed than\r\nextinguished by the death of Udall in prison, and the execution of Penry\r\nand Barrow in 1593.\r\n\r\n[42] Large extracts from it are given by Arber.\r\n\r\n[43] As the titles of these productions are highly characteristic of the\r\nstyle of the controversy, and, indeed, are sometimes considerably more\r\npoignant than the text, it may be well to give some of them in full as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n_The Epistle._--Oh read over D. John Bridges, for it is a worthy work: Or\r\nan Epitome of the first book of that right worshipful volume, written\r\nagainst the Puritans, in the defence of the noble Clergy, by as worshipful\r\na Priest, John Bridges, Presbyter, Priest or Elder, Doctor of Divillity\r\n[_sic_], and Dean of Sarum, Wherein the arguments of the Puritans are\r\nwisely presented, that when they come to answer M. Doctor, they must needs\r\nsay something that hath been spoken. Compiled for the behoof and overthrow\r\nof the Parsons Fyckers and Currats [_sic_] that have learnt their\r\ncatechisms, and are past grace: by the reverend and worthy Martin\r\nMarprelate, gentleman, and dedicated to the Confocation [_sic_] house. The\r\nEpitome is not yet published, but it shall be when the Bishops are at\r\nconvenient leisure to view the same. In the mean time let them be content\r\nwith this learned Epistle. Printed, oversea, in Europe, within two furlongs\r\nof a Bouncing Priest, at the cost and charges of M. Marprelate, gentleman.\r\n\r\n[44] Hay any work for Cooper, or a brief pistle directed by way of an\r\nhublication [_sic_] to the reverend bishops, counselling them if they will\r\nneeds be barrelled up for fear of smelling in the nostrils of her Majesty\r\nand the State, that they would use the advice of Reverend Martin for the\r\nproviding of their Cooper; because the Reverend T. C. (by which mystical\r\nletters is understood either the bouncing parson of East Meon or Tom Cokes\r\nhis chaplain), hath shewed himself in his late admonition to the people of\r\nEngland to be an unskilful and beceitful [_sic_] tub-trimmer. Wherein\r\nworthy Martin quits him like a man, I warrant you in the modest defence of\r\nhis self and his learned pistles, and makes the Cooper's hoops to fly off,\r\nand the bishops' tubs to leak out of all cry. Penned and compiled by Martin\r\nthe metropolitan. Printed in Europe, not far from some of the bouncing\r\npriests.\r\n\r\nThe actual authorship of the Martinist Tracts is still purely a matter of\r\nhypothesis. Penry has been the general favourite, and perhaps the argument\r\nfrom the difference of style in his known works is not quite convincing.\r\nThe American writer Dr. Dexter, a fervent admirer, as stated above, of the\r\nPuritans, is for Barrow. Mr. Arber thinks that a gentleman of good birth\r\nnamed Job Throckmorton, who was certainly concerned in the affair, was\r\nprobably the author of the more characteristic passages. Fantastic\r\nsuggestions of Jesuit attempts to distract the Anglican Church have also\r\nbeen made,--attempts sufficiently refuted by the improbability of the\r\npersons known to be concerned lending themselves to such an intrigue, for,\r\nhotheads as Penry and the rest were, they were transparently honest. On the\r\nside of the defence, authorship is a little better ascertained. Of Cooper's\r\nwork there is no doubt, and some purely secular men of letters were oddly\r\nmixed up in the affair. It is all but certain that John Lyly wrote the\r\nso-called _Pap with a Hatchet_,[45] which in deliberate oddity of phrase,\r\nscurrility of language, and desultoriness of method outvies the wildest\r\nMartinist outbursts. The later tract, _An Almond for a Parrot_,[46] which\r\ndeserves a very similar description, may not improbably be the same\r\nauthor's; and Dr. Grosart has reasonably attributed four anti-Martinist\r\ntracts (_A Countercuff to Martin Junior_ [_Martin Junior_ was one of the\r\nMarprelate treatises], _Pasquil's Return_, _Martin's Month's Mind_, and\r\n_Pasquil's Apology_), to Nash. But the discussion of such questions comes\r\nbut ill within the limits of such a book as the present.\r\n\r\n[45] Pap with a Hatchet, alias A fig for my godson! or Crack me this nut,\r\nor A country cuff that is a sound box of the ear for the idiot Martin for\r\nto hold his peace, seeing the patch will take no warning. Written by one\r\nthat dares call a dog a dog, and made to prevent Martin's dog-days.\r\nImprinted by John-a-noke and John-a-stile for the baylive [_sic_] of\r\nWithernam, _cum privilegio perennitatis_; and are to be sold at the sign of\r\nthe crab-tree-cudgel in Thwackcoat Lane. A sentence. Martin hangs fit for\r\nmy mowing.\r\n\r\n[46] An Almond for a Parrot, or Cuthbert Curryknaves alms. Fit for the\r\nknave Martin, and the rest of those impudent beggars that cannot be content\r\nto stay their stomachs with a benefice, but they will needs break their\r\nfasts with our bishops. _Rimarum sum plenus._ Therefore beware, gentle\r\nreader, you catch not the hicket with laughing. Imprinted at a place, not\r\nfar from a place, by the assigns of Signior Somebody, and are to be sold at\r\nhis shop in Troubleknave Street at the sign of the Standish.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the characteristics of the actual tracts, as they\r\npresent themselves and whosoever wrote them, is, on the other hand,\r\nentirely within our competence. On the whole the literary merit of the\r\ntreatises has, I think, been overrated. The admirers of Martin have even\r\ngone so far as to traverse Penry's perfectly true statement that in using\r\nlight, not to say ribald, treatment of a serious subject, he was only\r\nfollowing [Marnix de Sainte Aldegonde and] other Protestant writers, and\r\nhave attributed to him an almost entire originality of method, owing at\r\nmost something to the popular \"gags\" of the actor Richard Tarleton, then\r\nrecently dead. This is quite uncritical. An exceedingly free treatment of\r\nsacred and serious affairs had been characteristic of the Reformers from\r\nLuther downward, and the new Martin only introduced the variety of style\r\nwhich any writer of considerable talents is sure to show. His method, at\r\nany rate for a time, is no doubt sufficiently amusing, though it is hardly\r\neffective. Serious arguments are mixed up with the wildest buffoonery, and\r\nunconscious absurdities (such as a solemn charge against the unlucky Bishop\r\nAylmer because he used the phrase \"by my faith,\" and enjoyed a game at\r\nbowls) with the most venomous assertion or insinuation of really odious\r\noffences. The official answer to the _Epistle_ and the _Epitome_ has been\r\npraised by no less a person than Bacon[47] for its gravity of tone.\r\nUnluckily Dr. Cooper was entirely destitute of the faculty of relieving\r\nargument with humour. He attacks the theology of the Martinists with\r\nlearning and logic that leave nothing to desire; but unluckily he proceeds\r\nin precisely the same style to deal laboriously with the quips assigned by\r\nMartin to Mistress Margaret Lawson (a noted Puritan shrew of the day), and\r\nwith mere idle things like the assertion that Whitgift \"carried Dr. Perne's\r\ncloakbag.\" The result is that, as has been said, the rejoinder _Hay any\r\nWork for Cooper_ shows Martin, at least at the beginning, at his very best.\r\nThe artificial simplicity of his distortions of Cooper's really simple\r\nstatements is not unworthy of Swift, or of the best of the more recent\r\npractitioners of the grave and polite kind of political irony. But this is\r\nat the beginning, and soon afterwards Martin relapses for the most part\r\ninto the alternation between serious argument which will not hold water and\r\ngrotesque buffoonery which has little to do with the matter. A passage from\r\nthe _Epistle_ lampooning Aylmer, Bishop of London, and a sample each of\r\n_Pap with a Hatchet_ and the _Almond_, will show the general style. But the\r\nmost characteristic pieces of all are generally too coarse and too\r\nirreverent to be quotable:--\r\n\r\n[47] In his _Advertisement Touching the Controversies of the Church of\r\nEngland_ (Works. Folio, 1753, ii. p. 375).\r\n\r\n     [Sidenote: _I'll make you weary of it dumb John, except you leave\r\n     persecuting._]\r\n\r\n     \"Well now to mine eloquence, for I can do it I tell you. Who made\r\n     the porter of his gate a dumb minister? Dumb John of London. Who\r\n     abuseth her Majesty's subjects, in urging them to subscribe\r\n     contrary to law? John of London. Who abuseth the high commission,\r\n     as much as any? John London (and D. Stanhope too). Who bound an\r\n     Essex minister, in 200_l._ to wear the surplice on Easter Day\r\n     last?

John London. Who goeth to bowls upon the\r\n     Sabbath? Dumb Dunstical John of good London hath done all this. I\r\n     will for this time leave this figure, and tell your venerable\r\n     masterdoms a tale worth the hearing: I had it at the second hand:\r\n     if he that told it me added anything, I do not commend him, but I\r\n     forgive him: The matter is this. A man dying in Fulham, made one\r\n     of the Bishop of London's men his executor. The man had\r\n     bequeathed certain legacies unto a poor shepherd in the town. The\r\n     shepherd could get nothing of the Bishop's man, and therefore\r\n     made his moan unto a gentleman of Fulham, that belongeth to the\r\n     court of requests. The gentleman's name is M. Madox. The poor\r\n     man's case came to be tried in the Court of Requests. The B. man\r\n     desired his master's help: Dumb John wrote to the masters of\r\n     requests to this effect, and I think these were his words:\r\n\r\n     \"'My masters of the requests, the bearer hereof being my man,\r\n     hath a cause before you: inasmuch as I understand how the matter\r\n     standeth, I pray you let my man be discharged the court, and I\r\n     will see an agreement made. Fare you well.' The letter came to M.\r\n     D. Dale, he answered it in this sort:\r\n\r\n     \"'My Lord of London, this man delivered your letter, I pray you\r\n     give him his dinner on Christmas Day for his labour, and fare you\r\n     well.'\r\n\r\n     \"Dumb John not speeding this way, sent for the said M. Madox: he\r\n     came, some rough words passed on both sides, Presbyter John said,\r\n     Master Madox was very saucy, especially seeing he knew before\r\n     whom he spake: namely, the Lord of Fulham. Whereunto the\r\n     gentleman answered that he had been a poor freeholder in Fulham,\r\n     before Don John came to be L. there, hoping also to be so, when\r\n     he and all his brood (my Lady his daughter and all) should be\r\n     gone. At the hearing of this speech, the wasp got my brother by\r\n     the nose, which made him in his rage to affirm, that he would be\r\n     L. of Fulham as long as he lived in despite of all England. Nay,\r\n     soft there, quoth M. Madox, except her Majesty. I pray you, that\r\n     is my meaning, call dumb John, and I tell thee Madox that thou\r\n     art but a Jack to use me so: Master Madox replying, said that\r\n     indeed his name was John, and if every John were a Jack, he was\r\n     content to be a Jack (there he hit my L. over the thumbs). The B.\r\n     growing in choler, said that Master Madox his name did shew what\r\n     he was, for saith he, thy name is mad ox, which declareth thee to\r\n     be an unruly and mad beast. M. Madox answered again, that the B.\r\n     name, if it were descanted upon, did most significantly shew his\r\n     qualities. For said he, you are called Elmar, but you may be\r\n     better called marelm, for you have marred all the elms in Fulham:\r\n     having cut them all down.

Zeal herself will\r\n     cry out upon thee, and curse the time that ever she was mashed by\r\n     thy malice, who like a blind leader of the blind, sufferedst her\r\n     to stumble at every step in Religion, and madest her seek in the\r\n     dimness of her sight, to murder her mother the Church, from whose\r\n     paps thou like an envious dog but yesterday pluckedst her.\r\n     However, proud scorner, thy whorish impudency may happen\r\n     hereafter to insist in the derision of these fearful\r\n     denunciations, and sport thy jester's pen at the speech of my\r\n     soul, yet take heed least despair be predominant in the day of\r\n     thy death, and thou instead of calling for mercy to thy Jesus,\r\n     repeat more oftener to thyself, _Sic morior damnatus ut Judas_!\r\n     And thus much, Martin, in the way of compassion, have I spoke for\r\n     thy edification, moved thereto by a brotherly commiseration,\r\n     which if thou be not too desperate in thy devilish attempts, may\r\n     reform thy heart to remorse, and thy pamphlets to some more\r\n     profitable theme of repentance.\"\r\n\r\nIf Martin Marprelate is compared with the _Epistolae Obscurorum Virorum_\r\nearlier, or the _Satire Menippee_ very little later, the want of polish and\r\ndirectness about contemporary English satire will be strikingly apparent.\r\nAt the same time he does not compare badly with his own antagonists. The\r\ndivines like Cooper are, as has been said, too serious. The men of letters\r\nlike Lyly and Nash are not nearly serious enough, though some exception may\r\nbe made for Nash, especially if _Pasquil's Apology_ be his. They out-Martin\r\nMartin himself in mere abusiveness, in deliberate quaintness of phrase, in\r\nfantastic vapourings and promises of the dreadful things that are going to\r\nbe done to the enemy. They deal some shrewd hits at the glaring faults of\r\ntheir subject, his outrageous abuse of authorities, his profanity, his\r\nribaldry, his irrelevance; but in point of the three last qualities there\r\nis not much to choose between him and them. One line of counter attack they\r\ndid indeed hit upon, which was followed up for generations with no small\r\nsuccess against the Nonconformists, and that is the charge of hypocritical\r\nabuse of the influence which the Nonconformist teachers early acquired over\r\nwomen. The germs of the unmatched passages to this effect in _The Tale of a\r\nTub_ may be found in the rough horseplay of _Pap with a Hatchet_ and _An\r\nAlmond for a Parrot_. But the spirit of the whole controversy is in fact a\r\nspirit of horseplay. Abuse takes the place of sarcasm, Rabelaisian\r\nluxuriance of words the place of the plain hard hitting, with no flourishes\r\nor capers, but with every blow given straight from the shoulder, which\r\nDryden and Halifax, Swift and Bentley, were to introduce into English\r\ncontroversy a hundred years later. The peculiar exuberance of Elizabethan\r\nliterature, evident in all its departments, is nowhere more evident than in\r\nthis department of the prose pamphlet, and in no section of that department\r\nis it more evident than in the Tracts of the Martin Marprelate Controversy.\r\nNever perhaps were more wild and whirling words used about any exceedingly\r\nserious and highly technical matter of discussion; and probably most\r\nreaders who have ventured into the midst of the tussle will sympathise with\r\nthe adjuration of _Plain Percivall the Peacemaker of England_ (supposed to\r\nbe Richard Harvey, brother of Gabriel, who was himself not entirely free\r\nfrom suspicion of concernment in the matter), \"My masters, that strive for\r\nthis supernatural art of wrangling, let all be husht and quiet a-God's\r\nname.\" It is needless to say that the disputants did not comply with Plain\r\nPercivall's request. Indeed they bestowed some of their choicest abuse on\r\nhim in return for his advice. Not even by the casting of the most\r\npeacemaking of all dust, that of years and the grave, can it be said that\r\nthese jars at last _compacta quiescunt_. For it is difficult to find any\r\naccount of the transaction which does not break out sooner or later into\r\nstrong language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD DRAMATIC PERIOD\r\n\r\n\r\nI have chosen, to fill the third division of our dramatic chapters, seven\r\nchief writers of distinguished individuality, reserving a certain fringe of\r\nanonymous plays and of less famous personalities for the fourth and last.\r\nThe seven exceptional persons are Beaumont and Fletcher, Webster,\r\nMiddleton, Heywood, Tourneur, and Day. It would be perhaps lost labour to\r\nattempt to make out a severe definition, shutting these off on the one hand\r\nfrom their predecessors, on the other from those that followed them. We\r\nmust be satisfied in such cases with an approach to exactness, and it is\r\ncertain that while most of the men just named had made some appearance in\r\nthe latest years of Elizabeth, and while one or two of them lasted into the\r\nearliest years of Charles, they all represent, in their period of\r\nflourishing and in the character of their work, the Jacobean age. In some\r\nof them, as in Middleton and Day, the Elizabethan type prevails; in others,\r\nas in Fletcher, a distinctly new flavour--a flavour not perceptible in\r\nShakespere, much less in Marlowe--appears. But in none of them is that\r\nother flavour of pronounced decadence, which appears in the work of men so\r\ngreat as Massinger and Ford, at all perceptible. We are still in the\r\ncreative period, and in some of the work to be now noticed we are in a\r\ncomparatively unformed stage of it. It has been said, and not unjustly\r\nsaid, that the work of Beaumont and Fletcher belongs, when looked at on\r\none side, not to the days of Elizabeth at all, but to the later seventeenth\r\ncentury; and this is true to the extent that the post-Restoration\r\ndramatists copied Fletcher and followed Fletcher very much more than\r\nShakespere. But not only dates but other characteristics refer the work of\r\nBeaumont and Fletcher to a distinctly earlier period than the work of\r\ntheir, in some sense, successors Massinger and Ford.\r\n\r\nIt will have been observed that I cleave to the old-fashioned nomenclature,\r\nand speak of \"Beaumont and Fletcher.\" Until very recently, when two new\r\neditions have made their appearance, there was for a time a certain\r\ntendency to bring Fletcher into greater prominence than his partner, but at\r\nthe same time and on the whole to depreciate both. I am in all things but\r\nill-disposed to admit innovation without the clearest and most cogent\r\nproofs; and although the comparatively short life of Beaumont makes it\r\nimpossible that he should have taken part in some of the fifty-two plays\r\ntraditionally assigned to the partnership (we may perhaps add Mr. Bullen's\r\nremarkable discovery of _Sir John Barneveldt_, in which Massinger probably\r\ntook Beaumont's place), I see no reason to dispute the well-established\r\ntheory that Beaumont contributed at least criticism, and probably original\r\nwork, to a large number of these plays; and that his influence probably\r\nsurvived himself in conditioning his partner's work. And I am also disposed\r\nto think that the plays attributed to the pair have scarcely had fair\r\nmeasure in comparison with the work of their contemporaries, which was so\r\nlong neglected. Beaumont and Fletcher kept the stage--kept it constantly\r\nand triumphantly--till almost, if not quite, within living memory; while\r\nsince the seventeenth century, and since its earlier part, I believe that\r\nvery few plays of Dekker's or Middleton's, of Webster's or of Ford's, have\r\nbeen presented to an English audience. This of itself constituted at the\r\ngreat revival of interest in Elizabethan literature something of a\r\nprejudice in favour of _les oublies et les dedaignes_, and this prejudice\r\nhas naturally grown stronger since all alike have been banished from the\r\nstage. The Copper Captain and the Humorous Lieutenant, Bessus and Monsieur\r\nThomas, are no longer on the boards to plead for their authors. The\r\ncomparative depreciation of Lamb and others is still on the shelves to\r\nsupport their rivals.\r\n\r\nAlthough we still know but little about either Beaumont or Fletcher\r\npersonally, they differ from most of their great contemporaries by having\r\ncome of \"kenned folk,\" and by having to all appearance, industrious as they\r\nwere, had no inducement to write for money. Francis Beaumont was born at\r\nGracedieu, in Leicestershire in 1584. He was the son of a chief-justice;\r\nhis family had for generations been eminent, chiefly in the law; his\r\nbrother, Sir John Beaumont, was not only a poet of some merit, but a man of\r\nposition, and Francis himself, two years before his death in 1616, married\r\na Kentish heiress. He was educated at Broadgates Hall (now Pembroke\r\nCollege), Oxford, and seems to have made acquaintance with John Fletcher\r\nsoon after quitting the University. Fletcher was five years older than his\r\nfriend, and of a clerical family, his father being Bishop of London, and\r\nhis uncle, Giles Fletcher (the author of _Licia_), a dignitary of the\r\nChurch. The younger Giles Fletcher and his brother Phineas were thus\r\ncousins of the dramatist. Fletcher was a Cambridge man, having been\r\neducated at Benet College (at present and indeed originally known as Corpus\r\nChristi). Little else is known of him except that he died of the plague in\r\n1625, nine years after Beaumont's death, as he had been born five years\r\nbefore him. These two men, however, one of whom was but thirty and the\r\nother not fifty when he died, have left by far the largest collection of\r\nprinted plays attributed to any English author. A good deal of dispute has\r\nbeen indulged in as to their probable shares,--the most likely opinion\r\nbeing that Fletcher was the creator and Beaumont (whose abilities in\r\ncriticism were recognised by such a judge as Ben Jonson) the critical and\r\nrevising spirit. About a third of the whole number have been supposed to\r\nrepresent Beaumont's influence more or less directly. These include the two\r\nfinest, _The Maid's Tragedy_ and _Philaster_; while as to the third play,\r\nwhich may be put on the same level, _The Two Noble Kinsmen_, early\r\nassertion, confirmed by a constant catena of the best critical authority,\r\nmaintains that Beaumont's place was taken by no less a collaborator than\r\nShakespere. Fletcher, as has been said, wrote in conjunction with Massinger\r\n(we know this for certain from Sir Aston Cokain), and with Rowley and\r\nothers, while Shirley seems to have finished some of his plays. Some modern\r\ncriticism has manifested a desire to apply the always uncertain and usually\r\nunprofitable tests of separation to the great mass of his work. With this\r\nwe need not busy ourselves. The received collection has quite sufficient\r\nidiosyncrasy of its own as a whole to make it superfluous for any one,\r\nexcept as a matter of amusement, to try to split it up.\r\n\r\nIts characteristics are, as has been said, sufficiently marked, both in\r\ndefects and in merits. The comparative depreciation which has come upon\r\nBeaumont and Fletcher naturally fixes on the defects. There is in the work\r\nof the pair, and especially in Fletcher's work when he wrought alone, a\r\ncertain loose fluency, an ungirt and relaxed air, which contrasts very\r\nstrongly with the strenuous ways of the elder playwrights. This exhibits\r\nitself not in plotting or playwork proper, but in style and in\r\nversification (the redundant syllable predominating, and every now and then\r\nthe verse slipping away altogether into the strange medley between verse\r\nand prose, which we shall find so frequent in the next and last period),\r\nand also in the characters. We quit indeed the monstrous types of cruelty,\r\nof lust, of revenge, in which many of the Elizabethans proper and of\r\nFletcher's own contemporaries delighted. But at the same time we find a\r\ndecidedly lowered standard of general morality--a distinct approach towards\r\nthe _fay ce que voudras_ of the Restoration. We are also nearer to the\r\nregion of the commonplace. Nowhere appears that attempt to grapple with the\r\nimpossible, that wrestle with the hardest problems, which Marlowe began,\r\nand which he taught to some at least of his followers. And lastly--despite\r\ninnumerable touches of tender and not a few of heroic poetry--the actual\r\npoetical value of the dramas at their best is below that of the best work\r\nof the preceding time, and of such contemporaries as Webster and Dekker.\r\nBeaumont and Fletcher constantly delight, but they do not very often\r\ntransport, and even when they do, it is with a less strange rapture than\r\nthat which communicates itself to the reader of Shakespere _passim_, and to\r\nthe readers of many of Shakespere's fellows here and there.\r\n\r\nThis, I think, is a fair allowance. But, when it is made, a goodly capital\r\nwhereon to draw still remains to our poets. In the first place, no sound\r\ncriticism can possibly overlook the astonishing volume and variety of their\r\nwork. No doubt they did not often (if they ever did) invent their fables.\r\nBut they have never failed to treat them in such a way as to make them\r\noriginal, and this of itself shows a wonderful faculty of invention and\r\nconstitutes an inexhaustible source of pleasure. This pleasure is all the\r\nmore pleasurable because the matter is always presented in a thoroughly\r\nworkmanlike form. The shapelessness, the incoherence, the necessity for\r\nendless annotation and patching together, which mar so many even of the\r\nfinest Elizabethan plays, have no place in Beaumont and Fletcher. Their\r\ndramatic construction is almost narrative in its clear and easy flow, in\r\nits absence of puzzles and piecings. Again, their stories are always\r\ninteresting, and their characters (especially the lighter ones) always more\r\nor less attractive. It used to be fashionable to praise their \"young men,\"\r\nprobably because of the agreeable contrast which they present with the\r\nbrutality of the Restoration hero; but their girls are more to my fancy.\r\nThey were not straightlaced, and have left some sufficiently ugly and (let\r\nit be added) not too natural types of sheer impudence, such as the Megra of\r\n_Philaster_. Nor could they ever attain to the romantic perfection of\r\nImogen in one kind, of Rosalind in another, of Juliet in a third. But for\r\nportraits of pleasant English girls not too squeamish, not at all afraid of\r\nlove-making, quite convinced of the hackneyed assertion of the mythologists\r\nthat jests and jokes go in the train of Venus, but true-hearted,\r\naffectionate, and of a sound, if not a very nice morality, commend me to\r\nFletcher's Dorotheas, and Marys, and Celias. Add to this the excellence of\r\ntheir comedy (there is little better comedy of its kind anywhere than that\r\nof _A King and no King_, of the _Humorous Lieutenant_, of _Rule a Wife and\r\nhave a Wife_), their generally high standard of dialogue verse, their\r\ncharming songs, and it will be seen that if they have not the daemonic\r\nvirtue of a few great dramatic poets, they have at any rate very good,\r\nsolid, pleasant, and plentiful substitutes for it.\r\n\r\nIt is no light matter to criticise more than fifty plays in not many times\r\nfifty lines; yet something must be said about some of them at any rate. The\r\nplay which usually opens the series, _The Maid's Tragedy_, is perhaps the\r\nfinest of all on the purely tragic side, though its plot is a little\r\nimprobable, and to modern notions not very agreeable. Hazlitt disliked it\r\nmuch; and though this is chiefly to be accounted for by the monarchical\r\ntone of it, it is certainly faulty in parts. It shows, in the first place,\r\nthe authors' greatest dramatic weakness--a weakness common indeed to all\r\ntheir tribe except Shakespere--the representation of sudden and quite\r\ninsufficiently motived moral revolutions; and, secondly, another fault of\r\ntheirs in the representation of helpless and rather nerveless virtue\r\npunished without fault of its own indeed, but also without any effort. The\r\nAspatia of _The Maid's Tragedy_ and the Bellario of _Philaster_, pathetic\r\nas they are, are also slightly irritating. Still the pathos is great, and\r\nthe quarrel or threatened quarrel of the friends Amintor and Melantius, the\r\nhorrible trial put upon Amintor by his sovereign and the abandoned Evadne,\r\nas well as the whole part of Evadne herself when she has once been (rather\r\nimprobably) converted, are excellent. A passage of some length from the\r\nlatter part of the play may supply as well as another the sufficient\r\nrequirement of an illustrative extract:--\r\n\r\n    _Evad._ \"O my lord!\r\n\r\n    _Amin._ How now?\r\n\r\n    _Evad._ My much abused Lord! (_Kneels._)\r\n\r\n    _Amin._ This cannot be.\r\n\r\n    _Evad._ I do not kneel to live, I dare not hope it;\r\n            The wrongs I did are greater: look upon me\r\n            Though I appear with all my faults.\r\n\r\n    _Amin._ Stand up.\r\n            This is a new way to beget more sorrow.\r\n            Heav'n knows, I have too many; do not mock me;\r\n            Though I am tame and bred up with my wrongs\r\n            Which are my foster-brothers, I may leap\r\n            Like a hand-wolf into my natural wildness\r\n            And do an outrage: pray thee, do not mock me.\r\n\r\n    _Evad._ My whole life is so leprous, it infects\r\n            All my repentance: I would buy your pardon\r\n            Though at the highest set, even with my life:\r\n            That slight contrition, that's no sacrifice\r\n            For what I have committed.\r\n\r\n    _Amin._ Sure I dazzle.\r\n            There cannot be a Faith in that foul woman\r\n            That knows no God more mighty than her mischiefs:\r\n            Thou dost still worse, still number on thy faults\r\n            To press my poor heart thus. Can I believe\r\n            There's any seed of virtue in that woman\r\n            Left to shoot up, that dares go on in sin\r\n            Known, and so known as thine is? O Evadne!\r\n            'Would, there were any safety in thy sex,\r\n            That I might put a thousand sorrows off,\r\n            And credit thy repentance! But I must not;\r\n            Thou'st brought me to that dull calamity,\r\n            To that strange misbelief of all the world\r\n            And all things that are in it; that, I fear\r\n            I shall fall like a tree, and find my grave,\r\n            Only remembering that I grieve.\r\n\r\n    _Evad._ My lord,\r\n            Give me your griefs: you are an innocent,\r\n            A soul as white as Heav'n.

Give me thy hand;\r\n            From this time I will know thee, and as far\r\n            As honour gives me leave, be thy Amintor.\r\n            When we meet next, I will salute thee fairly\r\n            And pray the gods to give thee happy days.\r\n            My charity shall go along with thee\r\n            Though my embraces must be far from thee.\r\n            I should ha' kill'd thee, but this sweet repentance\r\n            Locks up my vengeance, for which thus I kiss thee,\r\n            The last kiss we must take.\"\r\n\r\nThe beautiful play of _Philaster_ has already been glanced at; it is\r\nsufficient to add that its detached passages are deservedly the most famous\r\nof all. The insufficiency of the reasons of Philaster's jealousy may be\r\nconsidered by different persons as affecting to a different extent the\r\nmerit of the piece. In these two pieces tragedy, or at least tragi-comedy,\r\nhas the upper hand; it is in the next pair as usually arranged (for the\r\nchronological order of these plays is hitherto unsolved) that Fletcher's\r\nsingular _vis comica_ appears. _A King and no King_ has a very serious\r\nplot; and the loves of Arbaces and Panthea are most lofty, insolent, and\r\npassionate. But the comedy of Bessus and his two swordsmen, which is fresh\r\nand vivid even after Bobadil and Parolles (I do not say Falstaff, because I\r\nhold it a vulgar error to consider Falstaff as really a coward at all), is\r\nperhaps more generally interesting. As for _The Scornful Lady_ it is comedy\r\npure and simple, and very excellent comedy too. The callousness of the\r\nyounger Loveless--an ugly forerunner of Restoration manners--injures it a\r\nlittle, and the instantaneous and quite unreasonable conversion of the\r\nusurer Morecraft a little more. But the humours of the Lady herself (a most\r\nMolieresque personage), and those of Roger and Abigail, with many minor\r\ntouches, more than redeem it. The plays which follow [49] are all comical\r\nand mostly farcical. The situations, rather than the expressions of _The\r\nCustom of the Country_, bring it under the ban of a rather unfair\r\ncondemnation of Dryden's, pronounced when he was quite unsuccessfully\r\ntrying to free the drama of himself and his contemporaries from Collier's\r\ndamning charges. But there are many lively traits in it. _The Elder\r\nBrother_ is one of those many variations on _cedant arma togae_ which men of\r\nletters have always been somewhat prone to overvalue; but the excellent\r\ncomedy of _The Spanish Curate_ is not impaired by the fact that Dryden\r\nchose to adapt it after his own fashion in The _Spanish Friar_. In _Wit\r\nWithout Money_, though it is as usual amusing, the stage preference for a\r\n\"roaring boy,\" a senseless crack-brained spendthrift, appears perhaps a\r\nlittle too strongly. _The Beggar's Bush_ is interesting because of its\r\nearly indications of cant language, connecting it with Brome's _Jovial\r\nCrew_, and with Dekker's thieves' Latin pamphlets. But the faults and the\r\nmerits of Fletcher have scarcely found better expression anywhere than in\r\n_The Humorous Lieutenant_. Celia is his masterpiece in the delineation of\r\nthe type of girl outlined above, and awkward as her double courtship by\r\nDemetrius and his father Antigonus is, one somehow forgives it, despite the\r\nnauseous crew of go-betweens of both sexes whom Fletcher here as elsewhere\r\nseems to take a pleasure in introducing. As for the Lieutenant he is quite\r\ncharming; and even the ultra-farcical episode of his falling in love with\r\nthe king owing to a philtre is well carried off. Then follows the\r\ndelightful pastoral of _The Faithful Shepherdess_, which ranks with\r\nJonson's _Sad Shepherd_ and with _Comus_, as the three chiefs of its style\r\nin English. _The Loyal Subject_ falls a little behind, as also does _The\r\nMad Lover_; but _Rule a Wife and have a Wife_ again rises to the first\r\nclass. Inferior to Shakespere in the power of transcending without\r\ntravestying human affairs, to Jonson in sharply presented humours, to\r\nCongreve and Sheridan in rattling fire of dialogue, our authors have no\r\nsuperior in half-farcical, half-pathetic comedy of a certain kind, and they\r\nhave perhaps nowhere shown their power better than in the picture of the\r\nCopper Captain and his Wife. The flagrant absurdity of _The Laws of Candy_\r\n(which put the penalty of death on ingratitude, and apparently fix no\r\ncriterion of what ingratitude is, except the decision of the person who\r\nthinks himself ungratefully treated), spoils a play which is not worse\r\nwritten than the rest. But in _The False One_, based on Egyptian history\r\njust after Pompey's death, and _Valentinian_, which follows with a little\r\npoetical license the crimes and punishment of that Emperor, a return is\r\nmade to pure tragedy--in both cases with great success. The magnificent\r\npassage which Hazlitt singled out from _The False One_ is perhaps the\r\nauthor's or authors' highest attempt in tragic declamation, and may be\r\nconsidered to have stopped not far short of the highest tragic poetry.\r\n\r\n[49] It may perhaps be well to mention that the references to \"volumes\" are\r\nto the ten-volume edition of 1750, by Theobald, Seward, and others.\r\n\r\n    \"'Oh thou conqueror,\r\n    Thou glory of the world once, now the pity:\r\n    Thou awe of nations, wherefore didst thou fall thus?\r\n    What poor fate followed thee, and plucked thee on\r\n    To trust thy sacred life to an Egyptian?\r\n    The life and light of Rome to a blind stranger,\r\n    That honourable war ne'er taught a nobleness\r\n    Nor worthy circumstance show'd what a man was?\r\n    That never heard thy name sung but in banquets\r\n    And loose lascivious pleasures? to a boy\r\n    That had no faith to comprehend thy greatness\r\n    No study of thy life to know thy goodness?...\r\n    Egyptians, dare you think your high pyramides\r\n    Built to out-dure the sun, as you suppose,\r\n    Where your unworthy kings lie rak'd in ashes,\r\n    Are monuments fit for him! No, brood of Nilus,\r\n    Nothing can cover his high fame but heaven;\r\n    No pyramid set off his memories,\r\n    But the eternal substance of his greatness,\r\n    To which I leave him.'\"\r\n\r\nThe chief fault of _Valentinian_ is that the character of Maximus is very\r\nindistinctly drawn, and that of Eudoxia nearly unintelligible. These two\r\npure tragedies are contrasted with two comedies, _The Little French Lawyer_\r\nand _Monsieur Thomas_, which deserve high praise. The fabliau-motive of the\r\nfirst is happily contrasted with the character of Lamira and the friendship\r\nof Clerimont and Dinant; while no play has so many of Fletcher's agreeable\r\nyoung women as _Monsieur Thomas_. _The Bloody Brother_, which its title\r\nspeaks as sufficiently tragical, comes between two excellent comedies, _The\r\nChances_ and _The Wild Goose Chase_, which might serve as well as any\r\nothers for samples of the whole work on its comic side. In _The Chances_\r\nthe portrait of the hare-brained Don John is the chief thing; in _The Wild\r\nGoose Chase_, as in _Monsieur Thomas_, a whole bevy of lively characters,\r\nmale and female, dispute the reader's attention and divide his preference.\r\n_A Wife for a Month_ sounds comic, but is not a little alloyed with\r\ntragedy; and despite the pathos of its central situation, is marred by some\r\nof Fletcher's ugliest characters--the characters which Shakespere in\r\nPandarus and the nurse in _Romeo and Juliet_ took care to touch with his\r\nlightest finger. _The Lover's Progress_, a doubtful tragedy, and _The\r\nPilgrim_, a good comedy (revived at the end of the century, as was _The\r\nProphetess_ with certain help from Dryden), do not require any special\r\nnotice. Between these two last comes _The Captain_, a comedy neither of the\r\nbest nor yet of the worst. The tragi-comic _Queen of Corinth_ is a little\r\nheavy; but in _Bonduca_ we have one of the very best of the author's\r\ntragedies, the scenes with Caratach and his nephew, the boy Hengo, being\r\nfull of touches not wholly unworthy of Shakespere. _The Knight of the\r\nBurning Pestle_ (where Fletcher, forsaking his usual fantastic grounds of a\r\nFrance that is scarcely French, and an Italy that is extremely un-Italian,\r\ncomes to simple pictures of London middle-class life, such as those of\r\nJonson or Middleton) is a very happy piece of work indeed, despite the\r\ndifficulty of working out its double presentment of burlesque\r\nknight-errantry and straightforward comedy of manners. In _Love's\r\nPilgrimage_, with a Spanish subject and something of a Spanish style, there\r\nis not enough central interest, and the fortunes by land and sea of _The\r\nDouble Marriage_ do not make it one of Fletcher's most interesting plays.\r\nBut _The Maid in the Mill_ and _The Martial Maid_ are good farce, which\r\nalmost deserves the name of comedy; and _The Knight of Malta_ is a romantic\r\ndrama of merit. In _Women Pleased_ the humours of avarice and hungry\r\nservility are ingeniously treated, and one of the starveling Penurio's\r\nspeeches is among the best-known passages of all the plays, while the\r\nanti-Puritan satire of Hope-on-High Bomby is also noteworthy. The next four\r\nplays are less noticeable, and indeed for two volumes, of the edition\r\nreferred to, we come to fewer plays that are specially good. _The Night\r\nWalker_; or, _The Little Thief_, though not very probable in its incidents,\r\nhas a great deal of lively business, and is particularly noteworthy as\r\nsupplying proof of the singular popularity of bell-ringing with all classes\r\nof the population in the seventeenth century,--a popularity which probably\r\nprotected many old bells in the mania for church desecration. Not much can\r\nbe said for _The Woman's Prize_, or, _The Tamer Tamed_, an avowed sequel,\r\nand so to speak, antidote to _The Taming of the Shrew_, which chiefly\r\nproves that it is wise to let Shakespere alone. The authors have drawn to\r\nsome extent on the _Lysistrata_ to aid them, but have fallen as far short\r\nof the fun as of the indecency of that memorable play. With _The Island\r\nPrincess_ we return to a fair, though not more than a fair level of\r\nromantic tragi-comedy, but _The Noble Gentleman_ is the worst play ever\r\nattributed (even falsely) to authors of genius. The subject is perfectly\r\nuninteresting, the characters are all fools or knaves, and the means\r\nadopted to gull the hero through successive promotions to rank, and\r\nsuccessive deprivations of them (the genuineness of neither of which he\r\ntakes the least trouble to ascertain), are preposterous. _The Coronation_\r\nis much better, and _The Sea Voyage_, with a kind of Amazon story grafted\r\nupon a hint of _The Tempest_, is a capital play of its kind. Better still,\r\ndespite a certain looseness both of plot and moral, is _The Coxcomb_, where\r\nthe heroine Viola is a very touching figure. The extravagant absurdity of\r\nthe traveller Antonio is made more probable than is sometimes the case with\r\nour authors, and the situations of the whole join neatly, and pass\r\ntrippingly. _Wit at Several Weapons_ deserves a somewhat similar\r\ndescription, and so does _The Fair Maid of the Inn_; while _Cupid's\r\nRevenge_, though it shocked the editors of 1750 as a pagan kind of play,\r\nhas a fine tragical zest, and is quite true to classical belief in its\r\ndelineation of the ruthlessness of the offended Deity. Undoubtedly,\r\nhowever, the last volume of this edition supplies the most interesting\r\nmaterial of any except the first. Here is _The Two Noble Kinsmen_, a play\r\nfounded on the story of Palamon and Arcite, and containing what I think\r\nirrefragable proofs of Shakespere's writing and versification, though I am\r\nunable to discern anything very Shakesperian either in plot or character.\r\nThen comes the fine, though horrible tragedy of _Thierry and Theodoret_, in\r\nwhich the misdeeds of Queen Brunehault find chroniclers who are neither\r\nsqueamish nor feeble. The beautiful part of Ordella in this play, though\r\nsomewhat sentimental and improbable (as is always the case with Fletcher's\r\nvery virtuous characters) ranks at the head of its kind, and is much\r\nsuperior to that of Aspatia in _The Maid's Tragedy_. _The Woman Hater_,\r\nsaid to be Fletcher's earliest play, has a character of rare comic, or at\r\nleast farcical virtue in the smell-feast Lazarillo with his Odyssey in\r\nchase of the Umbrana's head (a delicacy which is perpetually escaping him);\r\nand _The Nice Valour_ contains, in Chamont and his brother, the most\r\nsuccessful attempts of the English stage at the delineation of the point of\r\nhonour gone mad. Not so much, perhaps, can be said for _An Honest Man's\r\nFortune_, which, with a mask and a clumsy, though in part beautiful, piece\r\nentitled _Four Plays in One_, makes up the tale. But whosoever has gone\r\nthrough that tale will, if he has any taste for the subject, admit that\r\nsuch a total of work, so varied in character, and so full of excellences in\r\nall its variety, has not been set to the credit of any name or names in\r\nEnglish literature, if we except only Shakespere. Of the highest and most\r\nterrible graces, as of the sweetest and most poetical, Beaumont and\r\nFletcher may have little to set beside the masterpieces of some other men;\r\nfor accomplished, varied, and fertile production, they need not fear any\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\nIt has not been usual to put Thomas Middleton in the front rank among the\r\ndramatists immediately second to Shakespere; but I have myself no\r\nhesitation in doing so. If he is not such a poet as Webster, he is even a\r\nbetter, and certainly a more versatile, dramatist; and if his plays are\r\ninferior as plays to those of Fletcher and Massinger, he has a mastery of\r\nthe very highest tragedy, which neither of them could attain. Except the\r\nbest scenes of _The White Devil_, and _The Duchess of Malfi_, there is\r\nnothing out of Shakespere that can match the best scenes of _The\r\nChangeling_; while Middleton had a comic faculty, in which, to all\r\nappearance, Webster was entirely lacking. A little more is known about\r\nMiddleton than about most of his fellows. He was the son of a gentleman,\r\nand was pretty certainly born in London about 1570. It does not appear that\r\nhe was a university man, but he seems to have been at Gray's Inn. His\r\nearliest known work was not dramatic, and was exceedingly bad. In 1597 he\r\npublished a verse paraphrase of the _Wisdom of Solomon_, which makes even\r\nthat admirable book unreadable; and if, as seems pretty certain, the\r\n_Microcynicon_ of two years later is his, he is responsible for one of the\r\nworst and feeblest exercises in the school--never a very strong one--of\r\nHall and Marston. Some prose tracts of the usual kind are not better; but\r\neither at the extreme end of the sixteenth century, or in the very earliest\r\nyears of the next, Middleton turned his attention to the then all absorbing\r\ndrama, and for many years was (chiefly in collaboration) a busy playwright.\r\nWe have some score of plays which are either his alone, or in greatest part\r\nhis. The order of their composition is very uncertain, and as with most of\r\nthe dramatists of the period, not a few of them never appeared in print\r\ntill long after the author's death. He was frequently employed in composing\r\npageants for the City of London, and in 1620 was appointed city\r\nchronologer. In 1624 Middleton got into trouble. His play, _The Game of\r\nChess_, which was a direct attack on Spain and Rome, and a personal satire\r\non Gondomar, was immensely popular, but its nine days' run was abruptly\r\nstopped on the complaint of the Spanish ambassador; the poet's son, it\r\nwould seem, had to appear before the Council, and Middleton himself was\r\n(according to tradition) imprisoned for some time. In this same year he was\r\nliving at Newington Butts. He died there in the summer of 1627, and was\r\nsucceeded as chronologer by Ben Jonson. His widow, Magdalen, received a\r\ngratuity from the Common Council, but seems to have followed her husband in\r\na little over a year.\r\n\r\nMiddleton's acknowledged, or at least accepted, habit of collaboration in\r\nmost of the work usually attributed to him, and the strong suspicion, if\r\nnot more than suspicion, that he collaborated in other plays, afford\r\nendless opportunity for the exercise of a certain kind of criticism. By\r\nemploying another kind we can discern quite sufficiently a strong\r\nindividuality in the work that is certainly, in part or in whole, his; and\r\nwe need not go farther. He seems to have had three different kinds of\r\ndramatic aptitude, in all of which he excelled. The larger number of his\r\nplays consist of examples of the rattling comedy of intrigue and manners,\r\noften openly representing London life as it was, sometimes transplanting\r\nwhat is an evident picture of home manners to some foreign scene apparently\r\nfor no other object than to make it more attractive to the spectators. To\r\nany one at all acquainted with the Elizabethan drama their very titles\r\nspeak them. These titles are _Blurt Master Constable_, _Michaelmas Term_,\r\n_A Trick to Catch the Old One_, _The Family of Love_ [a sharp satire on the\r\nPuritans], _A Mad World, my Masters_, _No Wit no Help Like a Woman's_, _A\r\nChaste Maid in Cheapside_, _Anything for a Quiet Life_, _More Dissemblers\r\nbesides Women_. As with all the humour-comedies of the time, the incidents\r\nare not unfrequently very improbable, and the action is conducted with such\r\nintricacy and want of clearly indicated lines, that it is sometimes very\r\ndifficult to follow. At the same time, Middleton has a faculty almost\r\npeculiar to himself of carrying, it might almost be said of hustling, the\r\nreader or spectator along, so that he has no time to stop and consider\r\ndefects. His characters are extremely human and lively, his dialogue seldom\r\nlags, his catastrophes, if not his plots, are often ingenious, and he is\r\nnever heavy. The moral atmosphere of his plays is not very refined,--by\r\nwhich I do not at all mean merely that he indulges in loose situations and\r\nloose language. All the dramatists from Shakespere downwards do that; and\r\nMiddleton is neither better nor worse than the average. But in striking\r\ncontrast to Shakespere and to others, Middleton has no kind of poetical\r\nmorality in the sense in which the term poetical justice is better known.\r\nHe is not too careful that the rogues shall not have the best of it; he\r\nmakes his most virtuous and his vilest characters hobnob together very\r\ncontentedly; and he is, in short, though never brutal, like the\r\npost-Restoration school, never very delicate. The style, however, of these\r\nworks of his did not easily admit of such delicacy, except in the infusion\r\nof a strong romantic element such as that which Shakespere almost always\r\ninfuses. Middleton has hardly done it more than once--in the charming\r\ncomedy of _The Spanish Gipsy_,--and the result there is so agreeable that\r\nthe reader only wishes he had done it oftener.\r\n\r\nUsually, however, when his thoughts took a turn of less levity than in\r\nthese careless humorous studies of contemporary life, he devoted himself\r\nnot to the higher comedy, but to tragedy of a very serious class, and when\r\nhe did this an odd phenomenon generally manifested itself. In Middleton's\r\nidea of tragedy, as in that of most of the playwrights, and probably all\r\nthe playgoers of his day, a comic underplot was a necessity; and, as we\r\nhave seen, he was himself undoubtedly able enough to furnish such a plot.\r\nBut either because he disliked mixing his tragic and comic veins, or for\r\nsome unknown reason, he seems usually to have called in on such occasions\r\nthe aid of Rowley, a vigorous writer of farce, who had sometimes been\r\njoined with him even in his comic work. Now, not only was Rowley little\r\nmore than a farce writer, but he seems to have been either unable to make,\r\nor quite careless of making, his farce connect itself in any tolerable\r\nfashion with the tragedy of which it formed a nominal part. The result is\r\nseen in its most perfect imperfection in the two plays of _The Mayor of\r\nQueenborough_ and _The Changeling_, both named from their comic features,\r\nand yet containing tragic scenes, the first of a very high order, the\r\nsecond of an order only overtopped by Shakespere at his best. The humours\r\nof the cobbler Mayor of Queenborough in the one case, of the lunatic asylum\r\nand the courting of its keeper's wife in the other, are such very mean\r\nthings that they can scarcely be criticised. But the desperate love of\r\nVortiger for Rowena in _The Mayor_, and the villainous plots against his\r\nchaste wife, Castiza, are real tragedy. Even these, however, fall far below\r\nthe terrible loves, if loves they are to be called, of Beatrice-Joanna, the\r\nheroine of _The Changeling_, and her servant, instrument, and murderer, De\r\nFlores. The plot of the tragic part of this play is intricate and not\r\nwholly savoury. It is sufficient to say that Beatrice having enticed De\r\nFlores to murder a lover whom she does not love, that so she may marry a\r\nlover whom she does love, is suddenly met by the murderer's demand of her\r\nhonour as the price of his services. She submits, and afterwards has to\r\npurchase fresh aid of murder from him by a continuance of her favours that\r\nshe may escape detection by her husband. Thus, roughly described, the theme\r\nmay look like the undigested horrors of _Lust's Dominion_, of _The\r\nInsatiate Countess_, and of _The Revenger's Tragedy_. It is, however, poles\r\nasunder from them. The girl, with her southern recklessness of anything but\r\nher immediate desires, and her southern indifference to deceiving the very\r\nman she loves, is sufficiently remarkable, as she stands out of the canvas.\r\nBut De Flores,--the broken gentleman, reduced to the position of a mere\r\ndependant, the libertine whose want of personal comeliness increases his\r\nmistress's contempt for him, the murderer double and treble dyed, as\r\naudacious as he is treacherous, and as cool and ready as he is fiery in\r\npassion,--is a study worthy to be classed at once with Iago, and inferior\r\nonly to Iago in their class. The several touches with which these two\r\ncharacters and their situations are brought out are as Shakesperian as\r\ntheir conception, and the whole of that part of the play in which they\r\nfigure is one of the most wonderful triumphs of English or of any drama.\r\nEven the change of manners and a bold word or two here and there, may not\r\nprevent me from giving the latter part of the central scene:--\r\n\r\n    _Beat._ \"Why 'tis impossible thou canst be so wicked,\r\n            Or shelter such a cunning cruelty,\r\n            To make his death the murderer of my honour!\r\n            Thy language is so bold and vicious,\r\n            I cannot see which way I can forgive it\r\n            With any modesty.\r\n\r\n    _De F._ Pish![50] you forget yourself:\r\n            A woman dipped in blood, and talk of modesty!\r\n\r\n    _Beat._ O misery of sin! would I'd been bound\r\n            Perpetually unto my living hate\r\n            In that Pisacquo, than to hear[51] these words.\r\n            Think but upon the distance that creation\r\n            Set 'twixt thy blood and mine, and keep thee there.\r\n\r\n    _De F._ Look but unto your conscience, read me _there_;\r\n            'Tis a true book, you'll find me there your equal:\r\n            Pish! fly not to your birth, but settle you\r\n            In what the act has made you; you're no more now.\r\n            You must forget your parentage to me;\r\n            You are the deed's creature;[52] by that name\r\n            You lost your first condition, and I shall urge[53] you\r\n            As peace and innocency has turn'd you out,\r\n            And made you one with me.\r\n\r\n    _Beat._ With thee, foul villain!\r\n\r\n    _De F._ Yes, my fair murderess: do _you_ urge _me_?\r\n            Though thou writ'st maid, thou whore in thine affection!\r\n            'Twas changed from thy first love, and that's a kind\r\n            Of whoredom in thy heart: and he's changed now\r\n            To bring thy second on, thy Alsemero,\r\n            Whom by all sweets that ever darkness tasted\r\n            If I enjoy thee not, thou ne'er enjoyest!\r\n            I'll blast the hopes and joys of marriage,\r\n            I'll confess all; my life I rate at nothing.\r\n\r\n    _Beat._ De Flores!\r\n\r\n    _De F._ I shall rest from all (lover's)[54] plagues then,\r\n            I live in pain now; that [love] shooting eye\r\n            Will burn my heart to cinders.\r\n\r\n    _Beat._ O sir, hear me!\r\n\r\n    _De F._ She that in life and love refuses me,\r\n            In death and shame my partner she shall be.\r\n\r\n    _Beat._ (_kneeling_). Stay, hear me once for all: I make thee master\r\n            Of all the wealth I have in gold and jewels;\r\n            Let me go poor unto my bed with honour\r\n            And I am rich in all things.\r\n\r\n    _De F._ Let this silence thee;\r\n            The wealth of all Valencia shall not buy\r\n            My pleasure from me.\r\n            Can you weep Fate from its determined purpose?\r\n            So soon may you weep me.\r\n\r\n    _Beat._ Vengeance begins;\r\n            Murder, I see, is followed by more sins:\r\n            Was my creation in the womb so curst\r\n            It must engender with a viper first?\r\n\r\n    _De F._ (_raising her_). Come, rise and shroud your blushes in my\r\n                  bosom,\r\n            Silence is one of pleasure's best receipts.\r\n            Thy peace is wrought for ever in this yielding.\r\n            'Las, how the turtle pants! thou'lt love anon\r\n            What thou so fear'st and faint'st to venture on.\"\r\n\r\n[50] In orig. \"Push,\" cf. \"Tush.\"\r\n\r\n[51] Rather than hear.\r\n\r\n[52] A trisyllable, as in strictness it ought to be.\r\n\r\n[53] = \"claim.\"\r\n\r\n[54] This omission and the substitution in the next line are due to Dyce,\r\nand may be called _certissima emendatio_.\r\n\r\nTwo other remarkable plays of Middleton's fall with some differences under\r\nthe same second division of his works. These are _The Witch_ and _Women\r\nBeware Women_. Except for the inevitable and rather attractive comparison\r\nwith _Macbeth_, _The Witch_ is hardly interesting. It consists of three\r\ndifferent sets of scenes most inartistically blended,--an awkward and\r\nineffective variation on the story of Alboin, Rosmunda and the skull for a\r\nserious main plot, some clumsy and rather unsavoury comic or tragi-comic\r\ninterludes, and the witch scenes. The two first are very nearly worthless;\r\nthe third is intrinsically, though far below _Macbeth_, interesting enough\r\nand indirectly more interesting because of the questions which have been\r\nstarted, as to the indebtedness of the two poets to each other. The best\r\nopinion seems to be that Shakespere most certainly did not copy Middleton,\r\nnor (a strange fancy of some) did he collaborate with Middleton, and that\r\nthe most probable thing is that both borrowed their names, and some details\r\nfrom Reginald Scot's _Discovery of Witchcraft_. _Women Beware Women_ on the\r\nother hand is one of Middleton's finest works, inferior only to _The\r\nChangeling_ in parts, and far superior to it as a whole. The temptation of\r\nBianca, the newly-married wife, by the duke's instrument, a cunning and\r\nshameless woman, is the title-theme, and in this part again Middleton's\r\nShakesperian verisimilitude and certainty of touch appear. The end of the\r\nplay is something marred by a slaughter more wholesale even than that of\r\n_Hamlet_, and by no means so well justified. Lastly, _A Fair Quarrel_ must\r\nbe mentioned, because of the very high praise which it has received from\r\nLamb and others. This praise has been directed chiefly to the situation of\r\nthe quarrel between Captain Ager and his friend, turning on a question (the\r\npoint of family honour), finely but perhaps a little tediously argued. The\r\ncomic scenes, however, which are probably Rowley's, are in his best vein of\r\nbustling swagger.\r\n\r\nI have said that Middleton, as it seems to me, has not been fully\r\nestimated. It is fortunately impossible to say the same of Webster, and the\r\nreasons of the difference are instructive. Middleton's great fault is that\r\nhe never took trouble enough about his work. A little trouble would have\r\nmade _The Changeling_ or _Women Beware Women_, or even _The Spanish Gipsy_,\r\nworthy to rank with all but Shakespere's very masterpieces. Webster also\r\nwas a collaborator, apparently an industrious one; but he never seems to\r\nhave taken his work lightly. He had, moreover, that incommunicable gift of\r\nthe highest poetry in scattered phrases which, as far as we can see,\r\nMiddleton had not. Next to nothing is known of him. He may have been parish\r\nclerk of St. Andrew's, Holborn; but the authority is very late, and the\r\ncommentators seemed to have jumped at it to explain Webster's fancy for\r\ndetails of death and burial--a cause and effect not sufficiently\r\nproportioned. Mr. Dyce has spent much trouble in proving that he could not\r\nhave been the author of some Puritan tracts published a full generation\r\nafter the date of his masterpieces. Heywood tells us that he was generally\r\ncalled \"Jack,\" a not uncommon thing when men are christened John. He\r\nhimself has left us a few very sententiously worded prefaces which do not\r\nargue great critical taste. We know from the usual sources (Henslowe's\r\nDiaries) that he was a working furnisher of plays, and from many rather\r\ndubious title-pages we suppose or know some of the plays he worked at.\r\n_Northward Ho! Westward Ho!_ and _Sir John Wyatt_ are pieces of dramatic\r\njournalism in which he seems to have helped Dekker. He adapted, with\r\nadditions, Marston's _Malcontent_, which is, in a crude way, very much in\r\nhis own vein: he contributed (according to rather late authority) some\r\ncharming scenes (elegantly extracted, on a hint of Mr. Gosse's, by a recent\r\neditor) to _A Cure for a Cuckold_, one of Rowley's characteristic and not\r\nungenial botches of humour-comedy; he wrote a bad pageant or two, and some\r\nmiscellaneous verses. But we know nothing of his life or death, and his\r\nfame rests on four plays, in which no other writer is either known or even\r\nhinted to have had a hand, and which are in different ways of the first\r\norder of interest, if not invariably of the first order of merit. These are\r\n_The Duchess of Malfi_, _The White Devil_, _The Devil's Law Case_, and\r\n_Appius and Virginia_.\r\n\r\nOf _Appius and Virginia_ the best thing to be said is to borrow\r\nSainte-Beuve's happy description of Moliere's _Don Garcie de Navarre_, and\r\nto call it an _essai pale et noble_. Webster is sometimes very close to\r\nShakespere; but to read _Appius and Virginia_, and then to read _Julius\r\nCaesar_ or _Coriolanus_, is to appreciate, in perhaps the most striking way\r\npossible, the universality which all good judges from Dryden downwards have\r\nrecognised in the prince of literature. Webster, though he was evidently a\r\ngood scholar, and even makes some parade of scholarship, was a Romantic to\r\nthe core, and was all abroad in these classical measures. _The Devil's Law\r\nCase_ sins in the opposite way, being hopelessly undigested, destitute of\r\nany central interest, and, despite fine passages, a mere \"salmagundi.\"\r\nThere remain the two famous plays of _The White Devil_ or _Vittoria\r\nCorombona_ and _The Duchess of Malfi_--plays which were rarely, if ever,\r\nacted after their author's days, and of which the earlier and, to my\r\njudgment, better was not a success even then, but which the judgment of\r\nthree generations has placed at the very head of all their class, and which\r\ncontain magnificent poetry.\r\n\r\nI have said that in my judgment _The White Devil_ is the better of the two;\r\nI shall add that it seems to me very far the better. Webster's plays are\r\ncomparatively well known, and there is no space here to tell their rather\r\nintricate arguments. It need only be said that the contrast of the two is\r\nstriking and unmistakable; and that Webster evidently meant in the one to\r\nindicate the punishment of female vice, in the other to draw pity and\r\nterror by the exhibition of the unprevented but not unavenged sufferings of\r\nfemale virtue. Certainly both are excellent subjects, and if the latter\r\nseem the harder, we have Imogen and Bellafront to show, in the most diverse\r\nmaterial, and with the most diverse setting possible, how genius can manage\r\nit. With regard to _The White Devil_, it has been suggested with some\r\nplausibility that it wants expansion. Certainly the action is rather\r\ncrowded, and the recourse to dumb show (which, however, Webster again\r\npermitted himself in _The Duchess_) looks like a kind of shorthand\r\nindication of scenes that might have been worked out. Even as it is,\r\nhowever, the sequence of events is intelligible, and the presentation of\r\ncharacter is complete. Indeed, if there is any fault to find with it, it\r\nseems to me that Webster has sinned rather by too much detail than by too\r\nlittle. We could spare several of the minor characters, though none are\r\nperhaps quite so otiose as Delio, Julio, and others in _The Duchess of\r\nMalfi_. We feel (or at least I feel) that Vittoria's villainous brother\r\nFlamineo is not as Iago and Aaron and De Flores are each in his way, a\r\nthoroughly live creature. We ask ourselves (or I ask myself) what is the\r\ngood of the repulsive and not in the least effective presentment of the\r\nMoor Zanche. Cardinal Monticelso is incontinent of tongue and singularly\r\nfeeble in deed,--for no rational man would, after describing Vittoria as a\r\nkind of pest to mankind, have condemned her to a punishment which was\r\napparently little more than residence in a rather disreputable but by no\r\nmeans constrained boarding-house, and no omnipotent pope would have let\r\nLudivico loose with a clear inkling of his murderous designs. But when\r\nthese criticisms and others are made, _The White Devil_ remains one of the\r\nmost glorious works of the period. Vittoria is perfect throughout; and in\r\nthe justly-lauded trial scene she has no superior on any stage. Brachiano\r\nis a thoroughly lifelike portrait of the man who is completely besotted\r\nwith an evil woman. Flamineo I have spoken of, and not favourably; yet in\r\nliterature, if not in life, he is a triumph; and above all the absorbing\r\ntragic interest of the play, which it is impossible to take up without\r\nfinishing, has to be counted in. But the real charm of _The White Devil_ is\r\nthe wholly miraculous poetry in phrases and short passages which it\r\ncontains. Vittoria's dream of the yew-tree, almost all the speeches of the\r\nunfortunate Isabella, and most of her rival's, have this merit. But the\r\nmost wonderful flashes of poetry are put in the mouth of the scoundrel\r\nFlamineo, where they have a singular effect. The famous dirge which\r\nCornelia sings can hardly be spoken of now, except in Lamb's artfully\r\nsimple phrase \"I never saw anything like it,\" and the final speeches of\r\nFlamineo and his sister deserve the same endorsement. Nor is even the proud\r\nfarewell of the Moor Zanche unworthy. It is impossible to describe the\r\n\"whirl of spirits\" (as the good old-fashioned phrase has it) into which the\r\nreading of this play sets the reader, except by saying that the cause of\r\nthat whirl is the secret of the best Elizabethan writers, and that it is\r\nnowhere, out of Shakespere, better exemplified than in the scene partly\r\nextracted from Middleton, and in such passages of _Vittoria Corombona_ as\r\nthe following:--\r\n\r\n     _Cor._ \"Will you make me such a fool? here's a white hand:\r\n            Can blood so soon be wash'd out? let me see;\r\n            When screech-owls croak upon the chimney-tops\r\n            And the strange cricket i' the oven sings and hops,\r\n            When yellow spots do on your hands appear,\r\n            Be certain then you of a corse shall hear.\r\n            Out upon 't, how 'tis speckled!

In the first place, we cannot sympathise with the duchess, despite\r\nher misfortunes, as we do with the \"White Devil.\" She is neither quite a\r\nvirtuous woman (for in that case she would not have resorted to so much\r\nconcealment) nor a frank professor of \"All for Love.\" Antonio, her\r\nso-called husband, is an unromantic and even questionable figure. Many of\r\nthe minor characters, as already hinted, would be much better away. Of the\r\ntwo brothers the Cardinal is a cold-blooded and uninteresting debauchee and\r\nmurderer, who sacrifices sisters and mistresses without any reasonable\r\nexcuse. Ferdinand, the other, is no doubt mad enough, but not interestingly\r\nmad, and no attempt is made to account in any way satisfactorily for the\r\ndelay of his vengeance. By common consent, even of the greatest admirers of\r\nthe play, the fifth act is a kind of gratuitous appendix of horrors stuck\r\non without art or reason. But the extraordinary force and beauty of the\r\nscene where the duchess is murdered; the touches of poetry, pure and\r\nsimple, which, as in the _The White Devil_, are scattered all over the\r\nplay; the fantastic accumulation of terrors before the climax; and the\r\nremarkable character of Bosola,--justify the high place generally assigned\r\nto the work. True, Bosola wants the last touches, the touches which\r\nShakespere would have given. He is not wholly conceivable as he is. But as\r\na \"Plain Dealer\" gone wrong, a \"Malcontent\" (Webster's work on that play\r\nvery likely suggested him), turned villain, a man whom ill-luck and\r\nfruitless following of courts have changed from a cynic to a scoundrel, he\r\nis a strangely original and successful study. The dramatic flashes in the\r\nplay would of themselves save it. \"I am Duchess of Malfi still,\" and the\r\nother famous one \"Cover her face; mine eyes dazzle; she died young,\" often\r\nas they have been quoted, can only be quoted again. They are of the first\r\norder of their kind, and, except the \"already _my_ De Flores!\" of _The\r\nChangeling_, there is nothing in the Elizabethan drama out of Shakespere to\r\nmatch them.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that some harm has been done to Thomas Heywood by the\r\nenthusiastic phrase in which Lamb described him as \"a prose Shakespere.\"\r\nThe phrase itself is in the original quite carefully and sufficiently\r\nexplained and qualified. But unluckily a telling description of the kind is\r\nsure to go far, while its qualifications remain behind; and (especially\r\nsince a reprint by Pearson in the year 1874 made the plays of Heywood, to\r\nwhich one or two have since been added more or less conjecturally by the\r\nindustry of Mr. Bullen, accessible as a whole) a certain revolt has been\r\nmanifested against the encomium. This revolt is the effect of haste. \"A\r\nprose Shakespere\" suggests to incautious readers something like Swift, like\r\nTaylor, like Carlyle,--something approaching in prose the supremacy of\r\nShakespere in verse. But obviously that is not what Lamb meant. Indeed when\r\none remembers that if Shakespere is anything, he is a poet, the phrase may\r\nrun the risk of receiving an under--not an over--valuation. It is evident,\r\nhowever, to any one who reads Lamb's remarks in full and carefully--it is\r\nstill more evident to any one who without much caring what Lamb or any one\r\nelse has said, reads Heywood for himself--what he did mean. He was looking\r\nonly at one or two sides of the myriad-sided one, and he justly saw that\r\nHeywood touched Shakespere on these sides, if only in an incomplete and\r\nunpoetic manner. What Heywood has in common with Shakespere, though his\r\nprosaic rather than poetic treatment brings it out in a much less brilliant\r\nway, is his sympathy with ordinary and domestic character, his aversion\r\nfrom the fantastic vices which many of his fellows were prone to attribute\r\nto their characters, his humanity, his kindness. The reckless tragedy of\r\nblood and massacre, the reckless comedy of revelry and intrigue, were\r\nalways repulsive to him, as far as we can judge from the comparatively\r\nscanty remnant of the hundreds of plays in which he boasted that he had had\r\na hand, if not a chief hand. Besides these plays (he confesses to\r\nauthorship or collaboration in two hundred and twenty) he was a voluminous\r\nwriter in prose and verse, though I do not myself pretend to much knowledge\r\nof his non-dramatic work. Its most interesting part would have been a\r\n_Lives of the Poets_, which we know that he intended, and which could\r\nhardly have failed to give much information about his famous\r\ncontemporaries. As it is, his most remarkable and best-known work, not\r\ncontained in one of his dramas, is the curious and constantly quoted\r\npassage half complaining that all the chief dramatists of his day were\r\nknown by abbreviations of their names, but characteristically and\r\ngood-humouredly ending with the license--\r\n\r\n    \"I hold he loves me best who calls me Tom.\"\r\n\r\nWe have unfortunately no knowledge which enables us to call him many names\r\nexcept such as are derived from critical examination of his works. Little,\r\nexcept that he is said to have been a Lincolnshire man and a Fellow of\r\nPeterhouse, is known of his history. His masterpiece, _The Woman killed\r\nwith Kindness_ (in which a deceived husband, coming to the knowledge of his\r\nshame, drives his rival to repentance, and his wife to repentance and\r\ndeath, by his charity), is not wholly admirable. Shakespere would have\r\nfelt, more fully than Heywood, the danger of presenting his hero something\r\nof a wittol without sufficient passion of religion or affection to justify\r\nhis tolerance. But the pathos is so great, the sense of \"the pity of it\" is\r\nso simply and unaffectedly rendered, that it is impossible not to rank\r\nHeywood very high. The most famous \"beauties\" are in the following\r\npassage:--\r\n\r\n       _Anne._ \"O with what face of brass, what brow of steel,\r\n               Can you unblushing speak this to the face\r\n               Of the espoused wife of so dear a friend?\r\n               It is my husband that maintains your state,\r\n               Will you dishonour him that in your power\r\n               Hath left his whole affairs? I am his wife,\r\n               Is it to _me_ you speak?\r\n\r\n    _Wendoll._                    \"O speak no more:\r\n               For more than this I know and have recorded\r\n               Within the red-leaved table of my heart.\r\n               Fair and of all beloved, I was not fearful\r\n               Bluntly to give my life unto your hand,\r\n               And at one hazard all my worldly means.\r\n               Go, tell your husband; he will turn me off\r\n               And I am then undone: I care not, I,\r\n               'Twas for your sake. Perchance in rage he'll kill me;\r\n               I care not, 'twas for you. Say I incur\r\n               The general name of villain through the world,\r\n               Of traitor to my friend. I care not, I.\r\n               Beggary, shame, death, scandal and reproach\r\n               For you I'll hazard all--why, what care I?\r\n               For you I'll live and in your love I'll die.\"\r\n\r\nAnne capitulates with a suddenness which has been generally and rightly\r\npronounced a blot on the play; but her husband is informed by a servant and\r\nresolves to discover the pair. The action is prolonged somewhat too much,\r\nand the somewhat unmanly strain of weakness in Frankford is too\r\nperceptible; but these scenes are full of fine passages, as this:--\r\n\r\n    _Fr._ \"A general silence hath surprised the house,\r\n          And this is the last door. Astonishment,\r\n          Fear and amazement beat[55] upon my heart\r\n          Even as a madman beats upon a drum.\r\n          O keep my eyes, you heavens, before I enter,\r\n          From any sight that may transfix my soul:\r\n          Or if there be so black a spectacle,\r\n          O strike mine eyes stark blind! Or if not so,\r\n          Lend me such patience to digest my grief\r\n          That I may keep this white and virgin hand\r\n          From any violent outrage, or red murder,\r\n          And with that prayer I enter.\"\r\n\r\n[55] First ed. \"Play,\" which I am half inclined to prefer.\r\n\r\nA subsequent speech of his--\r\n\r\n    \"O God, O God that it were possible\r\n    To undo things done,\"\r\n\r\nhardly comes short of the touch which would have given us instead of a\r\nprose Shakespere a Shakespere indeed; and all the rest of the play, as far\r\nas the main plot is concerned, is full of pathos.\r\n\r\nIn the great number of other pieces attributed to him, written in all the\r\npopular styles, except the two above referred to, merits and defects are\r\nmixed up in a very curious fashion. Never sinking to the lowest depth of\r\nthe Elizabethan playwright, including some great ones, Heywood never rises\r\nto anything like the highest height. His chronicle plays are very weak,\r\nshowing no grasp of heroic character, and a most lamentable slovenliness of\r\nrhythm. Few things are more curious than to contrast with _Henry VI._ (to\r\nwhich some critics will allow little of Shakespere's work) and _Richard\r\nIII._ the two parts of _Edward IV._, in which Heywood, after a manner,\r\nfills the gap. There are good lines here and there, and touching traits;\r\nbut the whole, as a whole, is quite ludicrously bad, and \"written to the\r\ngallery,\" the City gallery, in the most innocent fashion. _If You Know Not\r\nMe You Know Nobody_, or _The Troubles of Queen Elizabeth_, also in two\r\nparts, has the same curious innocence, the same prosaic character, but\r\nhardly as many redeeming flashes. Its first part deals with Elizabeth's\r\nreal \"troubles,\" in her sister's days; its second with the Armada period\r\nand the founding of the Royal Exchange. For Heywood, unlike most of the\r\ndramatists, was always true to the City, even to the eccentric extent of\r\nmaking, in _The Four Prentices of London_, Godfrey of Bouillon and his\r\nbrethren members of the prentice-brotherhood. His classical and allegorical\r\npieces, such as _The Golden Age_ and its fellows, are most tedious and not\r\nat all brief. The four of them (_The Iron Age_ has two parts) occupy a\r\nwhole volume of the reprint, or more than four hundred closely printed\r\npages; and their clumsy dramatisation of Ovid's _Metamorphoses_, with any\r\nother classical learning that Heywood could think of thrust in, presents\r\n(together with various minor pieces of a somewhat similar kind) as striking\r\na contrast with _Troilus and Cressida_, as _Edward IV._ does with _Henry\r\nVI._ His spectacles and pageants, chiefly in honour of London (_London's\r\nJus Honorarium_, with other metaphorical Latin titles of the same\r\ndescription) are heavy, the weakness of his versification being especially\r\nfelt in such pieces. His strength lies in the domestic and contemporary\r\ndrama, where his pathos had free play, unrestrained by the necessity of\r\ntrying to make it rise to chivalrous or heroic height, and where his keen\r\nobservation of his fellow-men made him true to mankind in general, at the\r\nsame time that he gave a vivid picture of contemporary manners. Of this\r\nclass of his plays _A Woman killed with Kindness_ is undoubtedly the chief,\r\nbut it has not a few companions, and those in a sufficiently wide and\r\nvaried class of subject. _The Fair Maid of the Exchange_ is, perhaps, not\r\nnow found to be so very delectable and full of mirth as it is asserted to\r\nbe on its title-page, because it is full of that improbability and neglect\r\nof verisimilitude which has been noted as the curse of the minor\r\nElizabethan drama. The \"Cripple of Fenchurch,\" the real hero of the piece,\r\nis a very unlikely cripple; the heroines chop and change their affections\r\nin the most surprising manner; and the characters generally indulge in that\r\ncurious self-description and soliloquising in dialogue which is never\r\nfound in Shakespere, and is found everywhere else. But it is still a lively\r\npicture of contemporary manners. We should be sorry to lose _The Fair Maid\r\nof the West_ with its picture of Devonshire sailors, foreign merchants,\r\nkings of Fez, Bashaws of various parts, Italian dukes, and what not. The\r\ntwo parts make anything but a good play, but they are decidedly\r\ninteresting, and their tone supports Mr. Bullen's conjecture that we owe to\r\nHeywood the, in parts, admirable play of _Dick of Devonshire_, a\r\ndramatisation of the quarter-staff feats in Spain of Richard Peake of\r\nTavistock. _The English Traveller_ may rank with _A Woman killed with\r\nKindness_ as Heywood's best plays (there is, indeed, a certain community of\r\nsubject between them), but _A Maidenhead well Lost_, and _The Witches of\r\nLancashire_, are not far behind it; nor is _A Challenge for Beauty_. We can\r\nhardly say so much for _Love's Mistress_, which dramatises the story of\r\n_Cupid and Psyche_, or for _The Wise Woman of Hogsdon_ (Hoxton), a play\r\nrather of Middleton's type. But in _The Royal King and Loyal Subject_, and\r\nin _Fortune by Land and Sea_, the author shows again the sympathy with\r\nchivalrous character and adventure which (if he never can be said to be\r\nfully up to its level in the matter of poetic expression) was evidently a\r\nfavourite and constant motive with him. In short, Heywood, even at his\r\nworst, is a writer whom it is impossible not to like. His very considerable\r\ntalent, though it stopped short of genius, was united with a pleasant and\r\ngenial temper, and little as we know of his life, his dedications and\r\nprefaces make us better acquainted with his personality than we are with\r\nthat of much more famous men.\r\n\r\nNo greater contrast is possible than that between our last two names--Day\r\nand Tourneur. Little is known of them: Day was at Cambridge in 1592-3;\r\nTourneur shared in the Cadiz voyage of 1625 and died on its return. Both,\r\nit is pretty certain, were young men at the end of Elizabeth's reign, and\r\nwere influenced strongly by the literary fashions set by greater men than\r\nthemselves. But whereas Day took to the graceful fantasticalities of Lyly\r\nand to the not very savage social satire of Greene, Tourneur (or Turner)\r\naddressed himself to the most ferocious school of sub-Marlovian tragedy,\r\nand to the rugged and almost unintelligible satire of Marston. Something\r\nhas been said of his effort in the latter vein, the _Transformed\r\nMetamorphosis_. His two tragedies, _The Atheist's Tragedy_ and _The\r\nRevenger's Tragedy_, have been rather variously judged. The concentration\r\nof gloomy and almost insane vigour in _The Revenger's Tragedy_, the\r\nsplendid poetry of a few passages which have long ago found a home in the\r\nextract books, and the less separable but equally distinct poetic value of\r\nscattered lines and phrases, cannot escape any competent reader. But, at\r\nthe same time, I find it almost impossible to say anything for either play\r\nas a whole, and here only I come a long way behind Mr. Swinburne in his\r\nadmiration of our dramatists. The _Atheist's Tragedy_ is an inextricable\r\nimbroglio of tragic and comic scenes and characters, in which it is hardly\r\npossible to see or follow any clue; while the low extravagance of all the\r\ncomedy and the frantic rant of not a little of the tragedy combine to\r\nstifle the real pathos of some of the characters. _The Revenger's Tragedy_\r\nis on a distinctly higher level; the determination of Vindice to revenge\r\nhis wrongs, and the noble and hapless figure of Castiza, could not have\r\nbeen presented as they are presented except by a man with a distinct strain\r\nof genius, both in conception and execution. But the effect, as a whole, is\r\nmarred by a profusion of almost all the worst faults of the drama of the\r\nwhole period from Peele to Davenant. The incoherence and improbability of\r\nthe action, the reckless, inartistic, butcherly prodigality of blood and\r\nhorrors, and the absence of any kind of redeeming interest of contrasting\r\nlight to all the shade, though very characteristic of a class, and that no\r\nsmall one, of Elizabethan drama, cannot be said to be otherwise than\r\ncharacteristic of its faults. As the best example (others are _The\r\nInsatiate Countess_, Chettle's _Hoffmann_, _Lust's Dominion_, and the\r\nsingular production which Mr. Bullen has printed as _The Distracted\r\nEmperor_) it is very well worth reading, and contrasting with the really\r\ngreat plays of the same class, such as _The Jew of Malta_ and _Titus\r\nAndronicus_, where, though the horrors are still overdone, yet genius has\r\ngiven them a kind of passport. But intrinsically it is mere nightmare.\r\n\r\nOf a very different temper and complexion is the work of John Day, who may\r\nhave been a Cambridge graduate, and was certainly a student of Gonville and\r\nCaius, as he describes himself on the title-page of some of his plays and\r\nof a prose tract printed by Mr. Bullen. He appears to have been dead in\r\n1640, and the chief thing positively known about him is that between the\r\nbeginning of 1598 and 1608 he collaborated in the surprising number of\r\ntwenty-one plays (all but _The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green_ unprinted)\r\nwith Haughton, Chettle, Dekker, and others. _The Parliament of Bees_, his\r\nmost famous and last printed work, is of a very uncommon kind in\r\nEnglish--being a sort of dramatic allegory, touched with a singularly\r\ngraceful and fanciful spirit. It is indeed rather a masque than a play, and\r\nconsists, after the opening Parliament held by the Master, or Viceroy Bee\r\n(quaintly appearing in the original, which may have been printed in 1607,\r\nthough no copy seems now discoverable earlier than 1641, as \"Mr. Bee\"), of\r\na series of characters or sketches of Bee-vices and virtues, which are very\r\nhuman. The termination, which contains much the best poetry in the piece,\r\nand much the best that Day ever wrote, introduces King Oberon giving\r\njudgment on the Bees from \"Mr. Bee\" downwards and banishing offenders. Here\r\noccurs the often-quoted passage, beginning--\r\n\r\n    \"And whither must these flies be sent?\"\r\n\r\nand including the fine speech of Oberon--\r\n\r\n    \"You should have cried so in your youth.\"\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that both in this play and elsewhere passages occur\r\nin Day which seem to have been borrowed or stolen from or by other writers,\r\nsuch as Dekker and Samuel Rowley; but a charitable and not improbable\r\nexplanation of this has been found in the known fact of his extensive and\r\nintricate collaboration. _The Isle of Gulls_, suggested in a way by the\r\n_Arcadia_, though in general plan also fantastic and, to use a much abused\r\nbut decidedly convenient word, pastoral, has a certain flavour of the\r\ncomedy of manners and of contemporary satire. Then we have the quaint piece\r\nof _Humour out of Breath_, a kind of study in the for once conjoined\r\nschools of Shakespere and Jonson--an attempt at a combination of humorous\r\nand romantic comedy with some pathetic writing, as here:--\r\n\r\n    \"[O] Early sorrow art got up so soon?\r\n    What, ere the sun ascendeth in the east?\r\n    O what an early waker art thou grown!\r\n    But cease discourse and close unto thy work.\r\n    Under this drooping myrtle will I sit,\r\n    And work awhile upon my corded net;\r\n    And as I work, record my sorrows past,\r\n    Asking old Time how long my woes shall last.\r\n    And first--but stay! alas! what do I see?\r\n    Moist gum-like tears drop from this mournful tree;\r\n    And see, it sticks like birdlime; 'twill not part,\r\n    Sorrow is even such birdlime at my heart.\r\n    Alas! poor tree, dost thou want company?\r\n    Thou dost, I see't, and I will weep with thee;\r\n    Thy sorrows make me dumb, and so shall mine,\r\n    It shall be tongueless, and so seem like thine.\r\n    Thus will I rest my head unto thy bark,\r\n    Whilst my sighs ease my sorrows.\"\r\n\r\nSomething the same may be said of _Law Tricks_, or _Who would have Thought\r\nit?_ which has, however, in the character of the Count Horatio, a touch of\r\ntragedy. Another piece of Day's is in quite a different vein, being an\r\naccount in dramatised form of the adventures of the three brothers\r\nShirley--a kind of play which, from _Sir Thomas Stukeley_ downwards,\r\nappears to have been a very favourite one with Elizabethan audiences,\r\nthough (as might indeed be expected) it was seldom executed in a very\r\nsuccessful manner. Lastly, or first, if chronological order is taken, comes\r\n_The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green_, written by Day in conjunction with\r\nChettle, and ranging itself with the half historical, half romantic plays\r\nwhich were, as has been pointed out above, favourites with the first school\r\nof dramatists. It seems to have been very popular, and had a second and\r\nthird part, not now extant, but is by no means as much to modern taste as\r\nsome of the others. Indeed both Day and Tourneur, despite the dates of\r\ntheir pieces, which, as far as known, are later, belong in more ways than\r\none to the early school, and show how its traditions survived alongside of\r\nthe more perfect work of the greater masters. Day himself is certainly not\r\na great master--indeed masterpieces would have been impossible, if they\r\nwould not have been superfluous, in the brisk purveying of theatrical\r\nmatter which, from Henslowe's accounts, we see that he kept up. He had\r\nfancy, a good deal of wit, considerable versatility, and something of the\r\nsame sunshiny temper, with less of the pathos, that has been noticed in\r\nHeywood. If he wrote _The Maid's Metamorphosis_ (also ascribed\r\nconjecturally to Lyly), he did something less dramatically good, but\r\nperhaps poetically better, than his other work; and if, as has sometimes\r\nbeen thought,[56] _The Return from Parnassus_ is his, he is richer still.\r\nBut even without these, his existing poetical baggage (the least part of\r\nthe work which we know he accomplished) is more than respectable, and shows\r\nmore perhaps than that of any other distinctly minor writer the vast amount\r\nof loose talent--of miscellaneous inspiration--which was afloat in the air\r\nof his time.\r\n\r\n[56] I agree with Professor Hales in thinking it very improbable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOL OF SPENSER AND THE TRIBE OF BEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reign of James I. is not, in mere poetry, quite such a brilliant period\r\nas it is in drama. The full influence of Donne and of Jonson, which\r\ncombined to produce the exquisite if not extraordinarily strong school of\r\nCaroline poets, did not work in it. Of its own bards the best, such as\r\nJonson himself and Drayton, were survivals of the Elizabethan school, and\r\nhave accordingly been anticipated here. Nevertheless, there were not a few\r\nverse-writers of mark who may be most conveniently assigned to this time,\r\nthough, as was the case with so many of their contemporaries, they had\r\nsometimes produced work of note before the accession of the British\r\nSolomon, and sometimes continued to produce it until far into the reign of\r\nhis son. Especially there are some of much mark who fall to be noticed\r\nhere, because their work is not, strictly speaking, of the schools that\r\nflourished under Elizabeth, or of the schools that flourished under\r\nCharles. We shall not find anything of the first interest in them; yet in\r\none way or in another there were few of them who were unworthy to be\r\ncontemporaries of Shakespere.\r\n\r\nJoshua Sylvester is one of those men of letters whom accident rather than\r\nproperty seems to have made absurd. He has existed in English literature\r\nchiefly as an Englisher of the Frenchman Du Bartas, whom an even greater\r\nignorance has chosen to regard as something grotesque. Du Bartas is one of\r\nthe grandest, if also one of the most unequal, poets of Europe, and Joshua\r\nSylvester, his translator, succeeded in keeping some of his grandeur if he\r\neven added to his inequality. His original work is insignificant compared\r\nwith his translation; but it is penetrated with the same qualities. He\r\nseems to have been a little deficient in humour, and his portrait--crowned\r\nwith a singularly stiff laurel, throated with a stiffer ruff, and clothed,\r\nas to the bust, with a doublet so stiff that it looks like textile\r\narmour--is not calculated to diminish the popular ridicule. Yet is\r\nSylvester not at all ridiculous. He was certainly a Kentish man, and\r\nprobably the son of a London clothier. His birth is guessed, on good\r\ngrounds, at 1563; and he was educated at Southampton under the famous\r\nrefugee, Saravia, to whom he owed that proficiency in French which made or\r\nhelped his fame. He did not, despite his wishes, go to either university,\r\nand was put to trade. In this he does not seem to have been prosperous;\r\nperhaps he gave too much time to translation. He was probably patronised by\r\nJames, and by Prince Henry certainly. In the last years of his life he was\r\nresident secretary to the English company of Merchant Venturers at\r\nMiddleburgh, where he died on the 28th September 1618. He was not a\r\nfortunate man, but his descendants seem to have flourished both in England,\r\nthe West Indies and America. As for his literary work, it requires no doubt\r\na certain amount of good will to read it. It is voluminous, even in the\r\noriginal part not very original, and constantly marred by that loquacity\r\nwhich, especially in times of great inspiration, comes upon the uninspired\r\nor not very strongly inspired. The point about Sylvester, as about so many\r\nothers of his time, is that, unlike the minor poets of our day and of some\r\nothers, he has constant flashes--constant hardly separable, but quite\r\nperceivable, scraps, which show how genially heated the brain of the nation\r\nwas. Nor should it be forgotten that his Du Bartas had a great effect for\r\ngenerations. The man of pure science may regret that generations should\r\nhave busied themselves about anything so thoroughly unscientific; but with\r\nthat point of view we are unconcerned. The important thing is that the\r\ngenerations in question learnt from Sylvester to take a poetical interest\r\nin the natural world.\r\n\r\nJohn Davies of Hereford, who must have been born at about the same time as\r\nSylvester, and who certainly died in the same year, is another curiosity of\r\nliterature. He was only a writing-master,--a professor of the curious,\r\nelaborate penmanship which is now quite dead,--and he seems at no time to\r\nhave been a man of wealth. But he was, in his vocation or otherwise,\r\nfamiliar with very interesting people, both of the fashionable and the\r\nliterary class. He succeeded, poor as he was, in getting thrice married to\r\nladies born; and, though he seems to have been something of a coxcomb, he\r\nwas apparently as little of a fool as coxcombry will consist with. His work\r\n(of the most miscellaneous character and wholly in verse, though in subject\r\nas well as treatment often better suiting prose) is voluminous, and he\r\nmight have been wholly treated (as he has already been referred to) with\r\nthe verse pamphleteers, especially Rowlands, of an earlier chapter. But\r\nfluent and unequal as his verse is--obviously the production of a man who\r\nhad little better to offer than journalism, but for whom the times did not\r\nprovide the opening of a journalist--there is a certain salt of wit in it\r\nwhich puts him above the mere pamphleteers. His epigrams (most of which are\r\ncontained in _The Scourge of Folly_, undated, like others of his books) are\r\nby no means despicable; the Welsh ancestors, whom he did not fail to\r\ncommemorate, seem to have endowed him with some of that faculty for\r\nlampooning and \"flyting\" which distinguished the Celtic race. That they are\r\nfrequently lacking in point ought hardly to be objected to him; for the age\r\nhad construed the miscellaneous examples of Martial indulgently, and Jonson\r\nin his own generation, and Herrick after him (two men with whom Davies\r\ncannot compare for a moment in general power), are in their epigrams\r\nfrequently as pointless and a good deal coarser. His variations on English\r\nproverbs are also remarkable. He had a respectable vein of religious\r\nmoralising, as the following sonnet from _Wit's Pilgrimage_ will show:--\r\n\r\n    \"When Will doth long to effect her own desires,\r\n    She makes the Wit, as vassal to the will,\r\n    To do what she, howe'er unright, requires,\r\n    Which wit doth, though repiningly, fulfil.\r\n    Yet, as well pleased (O languishing wit!)\r\n    He seems to effect her pleasure willingly,\r\n    And all his reasons to her reach doth fit;\r\n    So like the world, gets love by flattery.\r\n    That this is true a thousand witnesses,\r\n    Impartial conscience, will directly prove;\r\n    Then if we would not willingly transgress,\r\n    Our will should swayed be by rules of love,\r\n    Which holds the multitude of sins because\r\n    Her sin morally to him his servants draws.\"\r\n\r\nThe defect of Davies, as of not a few of his contemporaries, is that,\r\nhaving the power of saying things rememberable enough, he set himself to\r\nwrap them up and merge them in vast heaps of things altogether\r\nunrememberable. His successors have too often resembled him only in the\r\nlatter part of his gift. His longer works (_Mirum in Modum_, _Summa\r\nTotalis_, _Microcosmus_, _The Holy Rood_, _Humours Heaven on Earth_, are\r\nsome of their eccentric titles) might move simple wonder if a century which\r\nhas welcomed _The Course of Time_, and _Yesterday, To-day, and For Ever_,\r\nnot to mention examples even more recent than these, had any great reason\r\nto throw stones at its forerunners. But to deal with writers like Davies is\r\na little difficult in a book which aims both at being nothing if not\r\ncritical, and at doing justice to the minor as well as to the major\r\nluminaries of the time: while the difficulty is complicated by the\r\nnecessity of _not_ saying ditto to the invaluable labourers who have\r\nreintroduced him and others like him to readers. I am myself full of the\r\nmost unfeigned gratitude to my friend Dr. Grosart, to Professor Arber, and\r\nto others, for sparing students, whose time is the least disposable thing\r\nthey have, visits to public libraries or begging at rich men's doors for\r\nthe sight of books. I should be very sorry both as a student and as a lover\r\nof literature not to possess Davies, Breton, Sylvester, Quarles, and the\r\nrest, and not to read them from time to time. But I cannot help warning\r\nthose who are not professed students of the subject that in such writers\r\nthey have little good to seek; I cannot help noting the difference between\r\nthem and other writers of a very different order, and above all I cannot\r\nhelp raising a mild protest against the encomiums which are sometimes\r\npassed on them. Southey, in that nearly best of modern books unclassified,\r\n_The Doctor_, has a story of a glover who kept no gloves that were not\r\n\"Best.\" But when the facts came to be narrowly inquired into, it was found\r\nthat the ingenious tradesman had no less than five qualities--\"Best,\"\r\n\"Better than Best,\" \"Better than better than Best,\" \"Best of All,\" and the\r\n\"Real Best.\" Such language is a little delusive, and when I read the\r\nepithets of praise which are sometimes lavished, not by the same persons,\r\non Breton and Watson, I ask myself what we are to say of Spenser and\r\nShakespere.\r\n\r\nDavies has no doubt also suffered from the fact that he had a contemporary\r\nof the same name and surname, who was not only of higher rank, but of\r\nconsiderably greater powers. Sir John Davies was a Wiltshire man of good\r\nfamily: his mother, Mary Bennet of Pyt-house, being still represented by\r\nthe Benett-Stanfords of Dorsetshire and Brighton. Born about 1569, he was a\r\nmember of the University of Oxford, and a Templar; but appears to have been\r\nanything but a docile youth, so that both at Oxford and the Temple he came\r\nto blows with the authorities. He seems, however, to have gone back to\r\nOxford, and to have resided there till close of middle life; some if not\r\nmost of his poems dating thence. He entered Parliament in 1601, and after\r\nfiguring in the Opposition during Elizabeth's last years, was taken into\r\nfavour, like others in similar circumstances, by James. Immediately after\r\nthe latter's accession Davies became a law officer for Ireland, and did\r\ngood and not unperilous service there. He was mainly resident in Ireland\r\nfor some thirteen years, producing during the time a valuable \"Discovery of\r\nthe Causes of the Irish Discontent.\" For the last ten years of his life he\r\nseems to have practised as serjeant-at-law in England, frequently serving\r\nas judge or commissioner of assize, and he died in 1626. His poetical work\r\nconsists chiefly of three things, all written before 1600. These are _Nosce\r\nTeipsum_, or the immortality of the soul, in quatrains, and as light as the\r\nunsuitableness of the subject to verse will allow; a singularly clever\r\ncollection of acrostics called _Astraea_, all making the name of Elizabetha\r\nRegina; and the _Orchestra_, or poem on dancing, which has made his fame.\r\nFounded as it is on a mere conceit--the reduction of all natural phenomena\r\nto a grave and regulated motion which the author calls dancing--it is one\r\nof the very best poems of the school of Spenser, and in harmony of metre\r\n(the seven-lined stanza) and grace of illustration is sometimes not too far\r\nbehind Spenser himself. An extract from it may be fitly followed by one of\r\nthe acrostics of _Astraea_:--\r\n\r\n    \"As the victorious twins of Leda and Jove,\r\n    (That taught the Spartans dancing on the sands\r\n    Of swift Eurotas) dance in heaven above,\r\n    Knit and united with eternal bands;\r\n    Among the stars, their double image stands,\r\n    Where both are carried with an equal pace,\r\n    Together jumping in their turning race.\r\n\r\n    \"This is the net, wherein the sun's bright eye,\r\n    Venus and Mars entangled did behold;\r\n    For in this dance, their arms they so imply,\r\n    As each doth seem the other to enfold.\r\n    What if lewd wits another tale have told\r\n    Of jealous Vulcan, and of iron chains!\r\n    Yet this true sense that forged lie contains.\r\n\r\n    \"These various forms of dancing Love did frame,\r\n    And besides these, a hundred millions more;\r\n    And as he did invent, he taught the same:\r\n    With goodly gesture, and with comely show,\r\n    Now keeping state, now humbly honouring low.\r\n    And ever for the persons and the place\r\n    He taught most fit, and best according grace.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Each day of thine, sweet month of May,\r\n    Love makes a solemn Holy Day.\r\n    I will perform like duty;\r\n    Since thou resemblest every way\r\n    Astraea, Queen of Beauty.\r\n    Both you, fresh beauties do partake,\r\n    Either's aspect, doth summer make.\r\n    Thoughts of young Love awaking,\r\n    Hearts you both do cause to ache;\r\n    And yet be pleased with aching.\r\n    Right dear art thou, and so is She,\r\n    Even like attractive sympathy\r\n    Gains unto both, like dearness.\r\n    I ween this made antiquity\r\n    Name thee, sweet May of majesty,\r\n    As being both like in clearness.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief direct followers of Spenser were, however, Giles and Phineas\r\nFletcher, and William Browne. The two first were, as has been said, the\r\ncousins of John Fletcher the dramatist, and the sons of Dr. Giles Fletcher,\r\nthe author of _Licia_. The exact dates and circumstances of their lives are\r\nlittle known. Both were probably born between 1580 and 1590. Giles, though\r\nthe younger (?), died vicar of Alderton in Suffolk in 1623: Phineas, the\r\nelder (?), who was educated at Eton and King's College, Cambridge (Giles\r\nwas a member of Trinity College in the same university), also took orders,\r\nand was for nearly thirty years incumbent of Hilgay-in-the-Fens, dying in\r\n1650.\r\n\r\nGiles's extant work is a poem in four cantos or parts, generally entitled\r\n_Christ's Victory and Triumph_. He chose a curious and rather infelicitous\r\nvariation on the Spenserian stanza _ababbccc_, keeping the Alexandrine but\r\nmissing the seventh line, with a lyrical interlude here and there. The\r\nwhole treatment is highly allegorical, and the lusciousness of Spenser is\r\nimitated and overdone. Nevertheless the versification and imagery are often\r\nvery beautiful, as samples of the two kinds will show:--\r\n\r\n    \"The garden like a lady fair was cut\r\n    That lay as if she slumber'd in delight,\r\n    And to the open skies her eyes did shut;\r\n    The azure fields of Heav'n were 'sembled right\r\n    In a large round, set with the flow'rs of light:\r\n    The flow'rs-de-luce, and the round sparks of dew,\r\n    That hung upon their azure leaves did shew\r\n    Like twinkling stars, that sparkle in the evening blue.\r\n\r\n    \"Upon a hilly bank her head she cast,\r\n    On which the bower of Vain-delight was built,\r\n    White and red roses for her face were placed,\r\n    And for her tresses marigolds were spilt:\r\n    Them broadly she displayed like flaming gilt,\r\n    Till in the ocean the glad day were drowned:\r\n    Then up again her yellow locks she wound,\r\n    And with green fillets in their pretty cauls them bound.\r\n\r\n    \"What should I here depaint her lily hand,\r\n    Her veins of violets, her ermine breast,\r\n    Which there in orient colours living stand:\r\n    Or how her gown with living leaves is drest,\r\n    Or how her watchman, armed with boughy crest,\r\n    A wall of prim hid in his bushes bears\r\n    Shaking at every wind their leafy spears\r\n    While she supinely sleeps, nor to be waked fears.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"See, see the flowers that below,\r\n    Now as fresh as morning blow,\r\n    And of all the virgin rose,\r\n    That as bright Aurora shows:\r\n    How they all unleaved die,\r\n    Losing their virginity;\r\n    Like unto a summer shade,\r\n    But now born and now they fade.\r\n    Everything doth pass away,\r\n    There is danger in delay.\r\n    Come, come gather then the rose,\r\n    Gather it, or it you lose.\r\n    All the sand of Tagus' shore\r\n    Into my bosom casts his ore:\r\n    All the valleys' swimming corn\r\n    To my house is yearly borne:\r\n    Every grape of every vine\r\n    Is gladly bruis'd to make me wine,\r\n    While ten thousand kings, as proud,\r\n    To carry up my train have bow'd,\r\n    And a world of ladies send me\r\n    In my chambers to attend me.\r\n    All the stars in Heaven that shine,\r\n    And ten thousand more, are mine:\r\n    Only bend thy knee to me,\r\n    Thy wooing shall thy winning be.\"\r\n\r\n_The Purple Island_, Phineas Fletcher's chief work, is an allegorical poem\r\nof the human body, written in a stanza different only from that of\r\n_Christ's Victory_ in being of seven lines only, the quintet of Giles being\r\ncut down to a regular elegiac quatrain. This is still far below the\r\nSpenserian stanza, and the colour is inferior to that of Giles. Phineas\r\nfollows Spenser's manner, or rather his mannerisms, very closely indeed,\r\nand in detached passages not unsuccessfully, as here, where the transition\r\nfrom Spenser to Milton is marked:--\r\n\r\n    \"The early morn lets out the peeping day,\r\n    And strew'd his path with golden marigolds:\r\n    The Moon grows wan, and stars fly all away.\r\n    Whom Lucifer locks up in wonted folds\r\n    Till light is quench'd, and Heaven in seas hath flung\r\n    The headlong day: to th' hill the shepherds throng\r\n    And Thirsil now began to end his task and song:\r\n\r\n    \"'Who now, alas! shall teach my humble vein,\r\n    That never yet durst peep from covert glade,\r\n    But softly learnt for fear to sigh and plain\r\n    And vent her griefs to silent myrtle's shade?\r\n    Who now shall teach to change my oaten quill\r\n    For trumpet 'larms, or humble verses fill\r\n    With graceful majesty, and lofty rising skill?\r\n\r\n    \"'Ah, thou dread Spirit! shed thy holy fire,\r\n    Thy holy flame, into my frozen heart;\r\n    Teach thou my creeping measures to aspire\r\n    And swell in bigger notes, and higher art:\r\n    Teach my low Muse thy fierce alarms to ring,\r\n    And raise my soft strain to high thundering,\r\n    Tune thou my lofty song; thy battles must I sing.\r\n\r\n    \"'Such as thou wert within the sacred breast\r\n    Of that thrice famous poet, shepherd, king;\r\n    And taught'st his heart to frame his cantos best\r\n    Of all that e'er thy glorious works did sing;\r\n    Or as, those holy fishers once among,\r\n    Thou flamedst bright with sparkling parted tongues;\r\n    And brought'st down Heaven to Earth in those all-conquering songs.'\"\r\n\r\nBut where both fail is first in the adjustment of the harmony of the\r\nindividual stanza as a verse paragraph, and secondly in the management of\r\ntheir fable. Spenser has everywhere a certain romance-interest both of\r\nstory and character which carries off in its steady current, where carrying\r\noff is needed, both his allegorising and his long descriptions. The\r\nFletchers, unable to impart this interest, or unconscious of the necessity\r\nof imparting it, lose themselves in shallow overflowings like a stream that\r\noverruns its bank. But Giles was a master of gorgeous colouring in phrase\r\nand rhythm, while in _The Purple Island_ there are detached passages not\r\nquite unworthy of Spenser, when he is not at his very best--that is to say,\r\nworthy of almost any English poet. Phineas, moreover, has, to leave\r\n_Britain's Ida_ alone, a not inconsiderable amount of other work. His\r\nPiscatory Eclogues show the influence of _The Shepherd's Calendar_ as\r\nclosely as, perhaps more happily than, _The Purple Island_ shows the\r\ninfluence of _The Faerie Queene_, and in his miscellanies there is much\r\nmusical verse. It is, however, very noticeable that even in these\r\noccasional poems his vehicle is usually either the actual stanza of the\r\n_Island_, or something equally elaborate, unsuited though such stanzas\r\noften are to the purpose. These two poets indeed, though in poetical\r\ncapacity they surpassed all but one or two veterans of their own\r\ngeneration, seem to have been wholly subdued and carried away by the mighty\r\nflood of their master's poetical production. It is probable that, had he\r\nnot written, they would not have written at all; yet it is possible that,\r\nhad he not written, they would have produced something much more original\r\nand valuable. It ought to be mentioned that the influence of both upon\r\nMilton, directly and as handing on the tradition of Spenser, was evidently\r\nvery great. The strong Cambridge flavour (not very perceptible in Spenser\r\nhimself, but of which Milton is, at any rate in his early poems, full)\r\ncomes out in them, and from _Christ's Victory_ at any rate the poet of\r\n_Lycidas_, the _Ode on the Nativity_, and _Paradise Regained_, apparently\r\n\"took up,\" as the phrase of his own day went, not a few commodities.\r\n\r\nThe same rich borrower owed something to William Browne, who, in his turn,\r\nlike the Fletchers, but with a much less extensive indebtedness, levied on\r\nSpenser. Browne, however, was free from the _genius loci_, being a\r\nDevonshire man born and of Exeter College, Oxford, by education. He was\r\nborn, they say, in 1591, published the first part of _Britannia's\r\nPastorals_ in 1613, made many literary and some noble acquaintances, is\r\nthought to have lived for some time at Oxford as a tutor, and either in\r\nSurrey or in his native county for the rest of his life, which is (not\r\ncertainly) said to have ended about 1643. Browne was evidently a man of\r\nvery wide literary sympathy, which saved him from falling into the mere\r\ngroove of the Fletchers. He was a personal friend and an enthusiastic\r\ndevotee of Jonson, Drayton, Chapman. He was a student of Chaucer and\r\nOccleve. He was the dear friend and associate of a poet more gifted but\r\nmore unequal than himself, George Wither. All this various literary\r\ncultivation had the advantage of keeping him from being a mere\r\nmocking-bird, though it did not quite provide him with any prevailing or\r\nwholly original pipe of his own. _Britannia's Pastorals_ (the third book of\r\nwhich remained in MS. for more than two centuries) is a narrative but\r\nextremely desultory poem, in fluent and somewhat loose couplets,\r\ndiversified with lyrics full of local colour, and extremely pleasant to\r\nread, though hopelessly difficult to analyse in any short space, or indeed\r\nin any space at all. Browne seems to have meandered on exactly as the fancy\r\ntook him; and his ardent love for the country, his really artistic though\r\nsomewhat unchastened gift of poetical description and presentment enabled\r\nhim to go on just as he pleased, after a fashion, of which here are two\r\nspecimens in different measures:--\r\n\r\n                                \"'May first\r\n    (Quoth Marin) swains give lambs to thee;\r\n    And may thy flood have seignory\r\n    Of all floods else; and to thy fame\r\n    Meet greater springs, yet keep thy name.\r\n    May never newt, nor the toad\r\n    Within thy banks make their abode!\r\n    Taking thy journey from the sea\r\n    May'st thou ne'er happen in thy way\r\n    On nitre or on brimstone mine,\r\n    To spoil thy taste! This spring of thine,\r\n    Let it of nothing taste but earth,\r\n    And salt conceived in their birth.\r\n    Be ever fresh! Let no man dare\r\n    To spoil thy fish, make lock or wear,\r\n    But on thy margent still let dwell\r\n    Those flowers which have the sweetest smell.\r\n    And let the dust upon thy strand\r\n    Become like Tagus' golden sand.\r\n    Let as much good betide to thee\r\n    As thou hast favour shew'd to me.'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Here left the bird the cherry, and anon\r\n    Forsook her bosom, and for more is gone,\r\n    Making such speedy flights into the thick\r\n    That she admir'd he went and came so quick.\r\n    Then, lest his many cherries should distaste,\r\n    Some other fruit he brings than he brought last.\r\n    Sometime of strawberries a little stem\r\n    Oft changing colours as he gather'd them,\r\n    Some green, some white, some red, on them infus'd,\r\n    These lov'd, these fear'd, they blush'd to be so us'd.\r\n    The peascod green, oft with no little toil\r\n    He'd seek for in the fattest, fertil'st soil\r\n    And rend it from the stalk to bring it to her,\r\n    And in her bosom for acceptance woo her.\r\n    No berry in the grove or forest grew\r\n    That fit for nourishment the kind bird knew,\r\n    Nor any powerful herb in open field\r\n    To serve her brood the teeming earth did yield,\r\n    But with his utmost industry he sought it,\r\n    And to the cave for chaste Marina brought it.\"\r\n\r\n_The Shepherd's Pipe_, besides reproducing Occleve, is in parts reminiscent\r\nof Chaucer, in parts of Spenser, but always characterised by the free and\r\nunshackled movement which is Browne's great charm; and the same\r\ncharacteristics appear in the few minor poems attributed to him. Browne has\r\nbeen compared to Keats, who read and loved him, and there are certainly not\r\na few points of resemblance. Of Keats's higher or more restrained\r\nexcellences, such as appear in the finest passages of _St. Agnes' Eve_, and\r\n_Hyperion_, in the _Ode to a Grecian Urn_, and such minor pieces as _In a\r\nDrear-Nighted December_, Browne had nothing. But he, like Keats, had that\r\nkind of love of Nature which is really the love of a lover; and he had,\r\nlike Keats, a wonderful gift of expression of his love.[57] Nor is he ever\r\nprosaic, a praise which certainly cannot be accorded to some men of far\r\ngreater repute, and perhaps of occasionally higher gifts both in his own\r\ntime and others. The rarest notes of Apollo he has not, but he is never\r\ndriven, as the poet and friend of his, to whom we next come, was often\r\ndriven, to the words of Mercury. This special gift was not very common at\r\nthe time; and though that time produced better poets than Browne, it is\r\nworth noting in him. He may never reach the highest poetry, but he is\r\nalways a poet.\r\n\r\n[57] Something of the same love, but unluckily much less of the same gift,\r\noccurs in the poems of a friend of Browne's once hardly known except by\r\nsome fair verses on Shakespere (\"Renowned Spenser,\" etc.), but made fully\r\naccessible by Mr. R. Warwick Bond in 1893. This was William Basse, a\r\nretainer of the Wenman family near Thame, the author, probably or\r\ncertainly, of a quaint defence of retainership, _Sword and Buckler_ (1602),\r\nand of other poems--_Pastoral Elegies_, _Urania_, _Polyhymnia_,\r\netc.--together with an exceedingly odd piece, _The Metamorphosis of the\r\nWalnut-Tree of Boarstall_, which is not quite like anything else of the\r\ntime. Basse, who seems also to have spelt his name \"Bas,\" and perhaps lived\r\nand wrote through the first forty or fifty years of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, is but a moderate poet. Still he is not contemptible, and deserves\r\nto rank as a member of the Spenserian family on the pastoral side; while\r\nthe _Walnut-Tree_, though it may owe something to _The Oak and the Brere_,\r\nhas a quaintness which is not in Spenser, and not perhaps exactly anywhere\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nThe comparative impotence of even the best criticism to force writers on\r\npublic attention has never been better illustrated than in the case of\r\nGeorge Wither himself. The greater part of a century has passed since\r\nCharles Lamb's glowing eulogy of him was written, and the terms of that\r\neulogy have never been contested by competent authority. Yet there is no\r\ncomplete collection of his work in existence, and there is no complete\r\ncollection even of the poems, saving a privately printed one which is\r\ninaccessible except in large libraries, and to a few subscribers. His\r\nsacred poems, which are not his best, were indeed reprinted in the Library\r\nof Old Authors; and one song of his, the famous \"Shall I Wasting in\r\nDespair,\" is universally known. But the long and exquisite poem of\r\n_Philarete_ was not generally known (if it is generally known now, which\r\nmay be doubted) till Mr. Arber reprinted it in the fourth volume of his\r\n_English Garner_. Nor can _Fidelia_ and _The Shepherd's Hunting_, things\r\nscarcely inferior, be said to be familiar to the general reader. For this\r\nneglect there is but one excuse, and that an insufficient one, considering\r\nthe immense quantity of very indifferent contemporary work which has had\r\nthe honour of modern publication. What the excuse is we shall say\r\npresently. Wither was born at Brentworth, in the Alresford district of\r\nHampshire (a district afterwards delightfully described by him), on 11th\r\nJune 1588. His family was respectable; and though not the eldest son, he\r\nhad at one time some landed property. He was for two years at Magdalen\r\nCollege, Oxford, of which he speaks with much affection, but was removed\r\nbefore taking his degree. After a distasteful experience of farm work,\r\nowing to reverses of fortune in his family he came to London, entered at\r\nLincoln's Inn, and for some years haunted the town and the court. In 1613\r\nhe published his _Abuses Stript and Whipt_, one of the general and rather\r\nartificial satires not unfashionable at the time. For this, although the\r\nbook has no direct personal reference that can be discovered, he was\r\nimprisoned in the Marshalsea; and there wrote the charming poem of _The\r\nShepherd's Hunting_, 1615, and probably also _Fidelia_, an address from a\r\nfaithful nymph to an inconstant swain, which, though inferior to _The\r\nShepherd's Hunting_ and to _Philarete_ in the highest poetical worth, is a\r\nsignal example of Wither's copious and brightly-coloured style. Three years\r\nlater came the curious personal poem of the _Motto_, and in 1622\r\n_Philarete_ itself, which was followed in the very next year by the _Hymns\r\nand Songs of the Church_. Although Wither lived until 2d May 1667, and was\r\nconstantly active with his pen, his _Hallelujah_, 1641, another book of\r\nsacred verse, is the only production of his that has received or that\r\ndeserves much praise. The last thirty years of his long life were eventful\r\nand unfortunate. After being a somewhat fervent Royalist, he suddenly\r\nchanged his creed at the outbreak of the great rebellion, sold his estate\r\nto raise men for the Parliament, and was active in its cause with pen as\r\nwell as with sword. Naturally he got into trouble at the Restoration (as he\r\nhad previously done with Cromwell), and was imprisoned again, though after\r\na time he was released. At an earlier period he had been in difficulties\r\nwith the Stationers' Company on the subject of a royal patent which he had\r\nreceived from James, and which was afterwards (though still fruitlessly)\r\nconfirmed by Charles, for his _Hymns_. Indeed, Wither, though a man of very\r\nhigh character, seems to have had all his life what men of high character\r\nnot unfrequently have, a certain facility for getting into what is vulgarly\r\ncalled hot-water.\r\n\r\nThe defect in his work, which has been referred to above, and which is\r\nsomewhat passed over in the criticisms of Lamb and others, is its amazing\r\ninequality. This is the more remarkable in that evidence exists of not\r\ninfrequent retouching on his part with the rather unusual result of\r\nimprovement--a fact which would seem to show that he possessed some\r\ncritical faculty. Such possession, however, seems on the other hand to be\r\nquite incompatible with the production of the hopeless doggerel which he\r\nnot infrequently signs. The felicity of language and the command of\r\nrhythmical effect which he constantly displays, are extraordinary, as for\r\ninstance in the grand opening of his first Canticle:--\r\n\r\n    \"Come kiss me with those lips of thine,\r\n      For better are thy loves than wine;\r\n    And as the poured ointments be\r\n      Such is the savour of thy name,\r\n    And for the sweetness of the same\r\n      The virgins are in love with thee.\"\r\n\r\nCompare the following almost unbelievable rubbish--\r\n\r\n    \"As we with water wash away\r\n      Uncleanness from our flesh,\r\n    And sometimes often in a day\r\n      Ourselves are fain to wash.\"\r\n\r\nEven in his earlier and purely secular work there is something, though less\r\nof this inequality, and its cause is not at all dubious. No poet, certainly\r\nno poet of merit, seems to have written with such absolute spontaneity and\r\nwant of premeditation as Wither. The metre which was his favourite, and\r\nwhich he used with most success--the trochaic dimeter catalectic of seven\r\nsyllables--lends itself almost as readily as the octosyllable to this\r\nfrequently fatal fluency; but in Wither's hands, at least in his youth and\r\nearly manhood, it is wonderfully successful, as here:--\r\n\r\n    \"And sometimes, I do admire\r\n    All men burn not with desire.\r\n    Nay, I muse her servants are not\r\n    Pleading love: but O they dare not:\r\n    And I, therefore, wonder why\r\n    They do not grow sick and die.\r\n    Sure they would do so, but that,\r\n    By the ordinance of Fate,\r\n    There is some concealed thing\r\n    So each gazer limiting,\r\n    He can see no more of merit\r\n    Than beseems his worth and spirit.\r\n    For, in her, a grace there shines\r\n    That o'erdaring thoughts confines,\r\n    Making worthless men despair\r\n    To be loved of one so fair.\r\n    Yea the Destinies agree\r\n    Some good judgments blind should be:\r\n    And not gain the power of knowing\r\n    Those rare beauties, in her growing.\r\n    Reason doth as much imply,\r\n    For, if every judging eye\r\n    Which beholdeth her should there\r\n    Find what excellences are;\r\n    All, o'ercome by those perfections\r\n    Would be captive to affections.\r\n    So (in happiness unblest)\r\n    She for lovers should not rest.\"\r\n\r\nNor had he at times a less original and happy command of the rhymed\r\ndecasyllabic couplet, which he sometimes handles after a fashion which\r\nmakes one almost think of Dryden, and sometimes after a fashion (as in the\r\nlovely description of Alresford Pool at the opening of _Philarete_) which\r\nmakes one think of more modern poets still. Besides this metrical\r\nproficiency and gift, Wither at this time (he thought fit to apologise for\r\nit later) had a very happy knack of blending the warm amatory enthusiasm of\r\nhis time with sentiments of virtue and decency. There is in him absolutely\r\nnothing loose or obscene, and yet he is entirely free from the\r\nmilk-and-water propriety which sometimes irritates the reader in such books\r\nas Habington's _Castara_. Wither is never mawkish, though he is never\r\nloose, and the swing of his verse at its best is only equalled by the rush\r\nof thought and feeling which animates it. As it is perhaps necessary to\r\njustify this high opinion, we may as well give the \"Alresford Pool\" above\r\nnoted. It is like Browne, but it is better than anything Browne ever did;\r\nbeing like Browne, it is not unlike Keats; it is also singularly like Mr.\r\nWilliam Morris.\r\n\r\n    \"For pleasant was that Pool; and near it, then,\r\n    Was neither rotten marsh nor boggy fen.\r\n    It was not overgrown with boisterous sedge,\r\n    Nor grew there rudely, then, along the edge\r\n    A bending willow, nor a prickly bush,\r\n    Nor broad-leafed flag, nor reed, nor knotty rush:\r\n    But here, well ordered, was a grove with bowers;\r\n    There, grassy plots, set round about with flowers.\r\n    Here, you might, through the water, see the land\r\n    Appear, strewed o'er with white or yellow sand.\r\n    Yon, deeper was it; and the wind, by whiffs,\r\n    Would make it rise, and wash the little cliffs;\r\n    On which, oft pluming, sate, unfrighted then\r\n    The gagling wild goose, and the snow-white swan,\r\n    With all those flocks of fowl, which, to this day\r\n    Upon those quiet waters breed and play.\"\r\n\r\nWhen to this gift of description is added a frequent inspiration of pure\r\nfancy, it is scarcely surprising that--\r\n\r\n    \"Such a strain as might befit\r\n    Some brave Tuscan poet's wit,\"\r\n\r\nto borrow a couplet of his own, often adorns Wither's verse.\r\n\r\nTwo other poets of considerable interest and merit belong to this period,\r\nwho are rather Scotch than English, but who have usually been included in\r\nhistories of English literature--Drummond of Hawthornden, and Sir William\r\nAlexander, Earl of Stirling. Both, but especially Drummond, exhibit equally\r\nwith their English contemporaries the influences which produced the\r\nElizabethan Jacobean poetry; and though I am not myself disposed to go\r\nquite so far, the sonnets of Drummond have sometimes been ranked before all\r\nothers of the time except Shakespere's.\r\n\r\nWilliam Drummond was probably born at the beautiful seat whence he derived\r\nhis designation, on 13th December 1585. His father was Sir John Drummond,\r\nand he was educated in Edinburgh and in France, betaking himself, like\r\nalmost all young Scotchmen of family, to the study of the law. He came back\r\nto Scotland from France in 1610, and resided there for the greater part of\r\nhis life, though he left it on at least two occasions for long periods,\r\nonce travelling on the continent for eight years to recover from the grief\r\nof losing a lady to whom he was betrothed, and once retiring to avoid the\r\ninconveniences of the Civil War. Though a Royalist, Drummond submitted to\r\nbe requisitioned against the Crown, but as an atonement he is said to have\r\ndied of grief at Charles I.'s execution in 1649. The most famous incidents\r\nof his life are the visit that Ben Jonson paid to him, and the much\r\ndiscussed notes of that visit which Drummond left in manuscript. It would\r\nappear, on the whole, that Drummond was an example of a well-known type of\r\ncultivated dilettante, rather effeminate, equally unable to appreciate\r\nJonson's boisterous ways and to show open offence at them, and in the same\r\nway equally disinclined to take the popular side and to endure risk and\r\nloss in defending his principles. He shows better in his verse. His sonnets\r\nare of the true Elizabethan mould, exhibiting the Petrarchian grace and\r\nromance, informed with a fire and aspiring towards a romantic ideal beyond\r\nthe Italian. Like the older writers of the sonnet collections generally,\r\nDrummond intersperses his quatorzains with madrigals, lyrical pieces of\r\nvarious lengths, and even with what he calls \"songs,\"--that is to say, long\r\npoems in the heroic couplet. He was also a skilled writer of elegies, and\r\ntwo of his on Gustavus Adolphus and on Prince Henry have much merit.\r\nBesides the madrigals included in his sonnets he has left another\r\ncollection entitled \"Madrigals and Epigrams,\" including pieces both\r\nsentimental and satirical. As might be expected the former are much better\r\nthan the latter, which have the coarseness and the lack of point noticeable\r\nin most of the similar work of this time from Jonson to Herrick. We have\r\nalso of his a sacred collection (again very much in accordance with the\r\npractice of his models of the preceding generation), entitled _Flowers of\r\nSion_, and consisting, like the sonnets, of poems of various metres. One of\r\nthese is noticeable as suggesting the metre of Milton's \"Nativity,\" but\r\nwith an alteration of line number and rhyme order which spoils it. Yet a\r\nfourth collection of miscellanies differs not much in constitution from the\r\nothers, and Drummond's poetical work is completed by some local pieces,\r\nsuch as _Forth Feasting_, some hymns and divine poems, and an attempt in\r\nMacaronic called _Polemo-Middinia_, which is perhaps not his. He was also a\r\nprose writer, and a tract, entitled _The Cypress Grove_, has been not\r\nunjustly ranked as a kind of anticipation of Sir Thomas Browne, both in\r\nstyle and substance. Of his verse a sonnet and a madrigal may suffice, the\r\nfirst of which can be compared with the Sleep sonnet given earlier:--\r\n\r\n    \"Sleep, Silence' child, sweet father of soft rest,\r\n    Prince whose approach peace to all mortals brings,\r\n    Indifferent host to shepherds and to kings,\r\n    Sole comforter of minds which are oppressed;\r\n    Lo, by thy charming rod, all breathing things\r\n    Lie slumb'ring, with forgetfulness possess'd,\r\n    And yet o'er me to spread thy drowsy wings\r\n    Thou spar'st, alas! who cannot be thy guest.\r\n    Since I am thine, O come, but with that face\r\n    To inward light, which thou art wont to show,\r\n    With feigned solace ease a true felt woe;\r\n    Or if, deaf god, thou do deny that grace,\r\n    Come as thou wilt, and what thou wilt bequeath:\r\n    I long to kiss the image of my death.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"To the delightful green\r\n    Of you, fair radiant een,\r\n    Let each black yield, beneath the starry arch.\r\n    Eyes, burnish'd Heavens of love,\r\n    Sinople[58] lamps of Jove,\r\n    Save all those hearts which with your flames you parch\r\n    Two burning suns you prove;\r\n    All other eyes, compared with you, dear lights\r\n    Are Hells, or if not Hells, yet dumpish nights.\r\n    The heavens (if we their glass\r\n    The sea believe) are green, not perfect blue;\r\n    They all make fair, whatever fair yet was,\r\n    And they are fair because they look like you.\"\r\n\r\n[58] In heraldry (but not English heraldry) = \"green.\"\r\n\r\nSir William Alexander, a friend and countryman of Drummond (who bewailed\r\nhim in more than one mournful rhyme of great beauty), was born in 1580 of a\r\nfamily which, though it had for some generations borne the quasi-surname\r\nAlexander, is said to have been a branch of the Clan Macdonald. Alexander\r\nearly took to a court life, was much concerned in the proposed planting of\r\nNova Scotia, now chiefly remembered from its connection with the Order of\r\nBaronets, was Secretary of State for Scotland, and was raised to the\r\npeerage. He died in 1640. Professor Masson has called him \"the second-rate\r\nScottish sycophant of an inglorious despotism.\" He might as well be called\r\n\"the faithful servant of monarchy in its struggle with the encroachments of\r\nRepublicanism,\" and one description would be as much question-begging as\r\nthe other. But we are here concerned only with his literary work, which was\r\nconsiderable in bulk and quality. It consists chiefly of a collection of\r\nsonnets (varied as usual with madrigals, etc.), entitled _Aurora_; of a\r\nlong poem on _Doomsday_ in an eight-lined stanza; of a _Paraenesis_ to\r\nPrince Henry; and of four \"monarchic tragedies\" on _Darius_, _Croesus_,\r\n_Alexander_, and _Caesar_, equipped with choruses and other appliances of\r\nthe literary rather than the theatrical tragedy. It is perhaps in these\r\nchoruses that Alexander appears at his best; for his special forte was\r\ngrave and stately declamation, as the second of the following extracts will\r\nprove. The first is a sonnet from _Aurora_:--\r\n\r\n    \"Let some bewitched with a deceitful show,\r\n    Love earthly things unworthily esteem'd,\r\n    And losing that which cannot be redeemed\r\n    Pay back with pain according as they owe:\r\n    But I disdain to cast my eyes so low,\r\n    That for my thoughts o'er base a subject seem'd,\r\n    Which still the vulgar course too beaten deem'd;\r\n    And loftier things delighted for to know.\r\n    Though presently this plague me but with pain,\r\n    And vex the world with wondering at my woes:\r\n    Yet having gained that long desired repose\r\n    My mirth may more miraculous remain.\r\n    That for the which long languishing I pine,\r\n    It is a show, but yet a show divine.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Those who command above,\r\n    High presidents of Heaven,\r\n    By whom all things do move,\r\n    As they have order given,\r\n    What worldling can arise\r\n    Against them to repine?\r\n    Whilst castled in the skies\r\n    With providence divine;\r\n    They force this peopled round,\r\n    Their judgments to confess,\r\n    And in their wrath confound\r\n    Proud mortals who transgress\r\n    The bounds to them assigned\r\n    By Nature in their mind.\r\n\r\n    \"Base brood of th' Earth, vain man,\r\n    Why brag'st thou of thy might?\r\n    The Heavens thy courses scan,\r\n    Thou walk'st still in their sight;\r\n    Ere thou wast born, thy deeds\r\n    Their registers dilate,\r\n    And think that none exceeds\r\n    The bounds ordain'd by fate;\r\n    What heavens would have thee to,\r\n    Though they thy ways abhor,\r\n    That thou of force must do,\r\n    And thou canst do no more:\r\n    This reason would fulfil,\r\n    Their work should serve their will.\r\n\r\n    \"Are we not heirs of death,\r\n    In whom there is no trust?\r\n    Who, toss'd with restless breath,\r\n    Are but a drachm of dust;\r\n    Yet fools whenas we err,\r\n    And heavens do wrath contract,\r\n    If they a space defer\r\n    Just vengeance to exact,\r\n    Pride in our bosom creeps,\r\n    And misinforms us thus\r\n    That love in pleasure sleeps\r\n    Or takes no care of us:\r\n    'The eye of Heaven beholds\r\n    What every heart enfolds.'\"\r\n\r\nNot a few of his other sonnets are also worth reading, and the unpromising\r\nsubject of _Doomsday_ (which connects itself in style partly with Spenser,\r\nbut perhaps still more with _The Mirror for Magistrates_), does not prevent\r\nit from containing fine passages. Alexander had indeed more power of\r\nsustained versification than his friend Drummond, though he hardly touches\r\nthe latter in point of the poetical merit of short isolated passages and\r\npoems. Both bear perhaps a little too distinctly the complexion of\r\n\"_Gentlemen_ of the Press\"--men who are composing poems because it is the\r\nfashion, and because their education, leisure, and elegant tastes lead them\r\nto prefer that form of occupation. But perhaps what is most interesting\r\nabout them is the way in which they reproduce on a smaller scale the\r\nphenomenon presented by the Scotch poetical school of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. That school, as is well known, was a direct offshoot from, or\r\nfollowing of the school of Chaucer, though in Dunbar at least it succeeded\r\nin producing work almost, if not quite, original in form. In the same way,\r\nDrummond and Alexander, while able to the full to experience directly the\r\nforeign, and especially Italian influences which had been so strong on the\r\nElizabethans, were still in the main followers of the Elizabethans\r\nthemselves, and formed, as it were, a Scottish moon to the English sun of\r\npoetry. There is little or nothing that is distinctively national about\r\nthem, though in their following of the English model they show talent at\r\nleast equal to all but the best of the school they followed. But this fact,\r\njoined to those above noted, helps, no doubt, to give an air of want of\r\nspontaneity to their verse--an air as of the literary exercise.\r\n\r\nThere are other writers who might indifferently come in this chapter or in\r\nthat on Caroline poetry, for the reign of James was as much overlapped in\r\nthis respect by his son's as by Elizabeth's, and there are others who need\r\nbut slight notice, besides yet others--a great multitude--who can receive\r\nno notice at all. The doggerel of Taylor, the water-poet (not a bad prose\r\nwriter), received both patronage and attention, which seem to have annoyed\r\nhis betters, and he has been resuscitated even in our own times. Francis\r\nBeaumont, the coadjutor of Fletcher, has left independent poetical work\r\nwhich, on the whole, confirms the general theory that the chief execution\r\nof the joint plays must have been his partner's, but which (as in the\r\n_Letter to Ben Jonson_ and the fine stoicism of _The Honest Man's Fortune_)\r\ncontains some very good things. His brother, Sir John Beaumont, who died\r\nnot so young as Francis, but at the comparatively early age of forty-four,\r\nwas the author of a historical poem on _Bosworth Field_, as well as of\r\nminor pieces of higher merit, including some remarkable critical\r\nobservations on English verse. Two famous poems, which everyone knows by\r\nheart, the \"You Meaner Beauties of the Night\" of Sir Henry Wotton and the\r\n\"Tell Me no more how fair She is\" of Bishop Henry King, are merely perfect\r\nexamples of a style of verse which was largely if not often quite so\r\nperfectly practised by lesser or less known men, as well as by greater\r\nones.[59]\r\n\r\n[59] The most interesting collection and selection of verse of this class\r\nand time is undoubtedly Dr. Hannah's well-known and charming but rather\r\noddly entitled _Poems of Raleigh, Wotton, and other Courtly Poets_ in the\r\nAldine Series. I say oddly entitled, because though Raleigh and Wotton were\r\ncertainly courtiers, it would be hard to make the name good of some of the\r\nminor contributors.\r\n\r\nThere is, moreover, a class of verse which has been referred to\r\nincidentally before, and which may very likely be referred to incidentally\r\nagain, but which is too abundant, too characteristic, and too charming not\r\nto merit a place, if no very large one, to itself. I refer to the\r\ndelightful songs which are scattered all over the plays of the period, from\r\nGreene to Shirley. As far as Shakespere is concerned, these songs are well\r\nenough known, and Mr. Palgrave's _Treasury_, with Mr. Bullen's and Bell's\r\n_Songs from the Dramatists_, have given an inferior currency, but still a\r\ncurrency, to the best of the remainder. The earlier we have spoken of. But\r\nthe songs of Greene and his fellows, though charming, cannot compare with\r\nthose of the more properly Jacobean poets. To name only the best of each,\r\nBen Jonson gives us the exquisite \"Queen and Huntress,\" which is perhaps\r\nthe best-known piece of his whole work; the pleasant \"If I freely may\r\ndiscover,\" and best of all--unsurpassed indeed in any language for rolling\r\nmajesty of rhythm and romantic charm of tone--\"Drink to me only with thine\r\neyes.\" Again the songs in Beaumont and Fletcher stand very high, perhaps\r\nhighest of all next to Shakespere's in respect of the \"woodnote wild.\" If\r\nthe snatch of only half articulate poetry of the \"Lay a garland on my\r\nhearse,\" of _The Maid's Tragedy_, is really Fletcher's, he has here\r\nequalled Shakespere himself. We may add to it the fantastic and charming\r\n\"Beauty clear and fair,\" of _The Elder Brother_, the comic swing of \"Let\r\nthe bells ring,\" and \"The fit's upon me now;\" all the songs without\r\nexception in _The Faithful Shepherdess_, which is much less a drama than a\r\nmiscellany of the most delightful poetry; the lively war-song in _The Mad\r\nLover_, to which Dryden owed not a little; the catch, \"Drink to-day and\r\ndrown all sorrow;\" the strange song of the dead host in _The Lover's\r\nProgress_; the exquisite \"Weep no more,\" of _The Queen of Corinth_; the\r\nspirited \"Let the mill go round,\" of _The Maid in the Mill_; the \"Lovers\r\nrejoice,\" of _Cupid's Revenge_; the \"Roses, their sharp spines being gone,\"\r\nwhich is one of the most Shakesperean things of _The Two Noble Kinsmen_;\r\nthe famous \"Hence, all you vain-delights,\" of _The Nice Valour_, which\r\nMilton expanded into _Il Penseroso_, and the laughing song of the same\r\nplay. This long catalogue only contains a part of the singularly beautiful\r\nsong work of the great pair of dramatists, and as an example we may give\r\none of the least known from _The Captain_:--\r\n\r\n    \"Tell me, dearest, what is love?\r\n    'Tis a lightning from above;\r\n    'Tis an arrow, 'tis a fire,\r\n    'Tis a boy they call Desire.\r\n            'Tis a grave,\r\n            Gapes to have\r\n    Those poor fools that long to prove.\r\n\r\n    \"Tell me more, are women true?\r\n    Yes, some are, and some as you.\r\n    Some are willing, some are strange\r\n    Since you men first taught to change.\r\n            And till troth\r\n            Be in both,\r\n    All shall love to love anew.\r\n\r\n    \"Tell me more yet, can they grieve?\r\n    Yes, and sicken sore, but live,\r\n    And be wise, and delay\r\n    When you men are as wise as they.\r\n            Then I see,\r\n            Faith will be\r\n    Never till they both believe.\"\r\n\r\nThe dirge of _Vittoria Corombona_ and the preparation for death of _The\r\nDuchess of Malfi_ are Webster's sole but sufficient contributions to the\r\nlist. The witch songs of Middleton's _Witch_, and the gipsy, or rather\r\ntramp, songs of _More Dissemblers besides Women_ and _The Spanish Gipsy_,\r\nhave very high merit. The songs of _Patient Grissell_, which are pretty\r\ncertainly Dekker's, have been noticed already. The otherwise worthless play\r\nof _The Thracian Wonder_, attributed to Webster and Rowley, contains an\r\nunusual number of good songs. Heywood and Massinger were not great at\r\nsongs, and the superiority of those in _The Sun's Darling_ over the songs\r\nin Ford's other plays, seems to point to the authorship of Dekker. Finally,\r\nJames Shirley has the song gift of his greater predecessors. Every one\r\nknows \"The glories of our blood and state,\" but this is by no means his\r\nonly good song; it worthily closes the list of the kind--a kind which, when\r\nbrought together and perused separately, exhibits, perhaps, as well as\r\nanything else of equal compass, the extraordinary abundance of poetical\r\nspirit in the age. For songs like these are not to be hammered out by the\r\nmost diligent ingenuity, not to be spun by the light of the most\r\nassiduously fed lamp. The wind of such inspiration blows where, and only\r\nwhere, it listeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nMILTON, TAYLOR, CLARENDON, BROWNE, HOBBES\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the second and third quarters of the seventeenth century, or (to\r\ntake literary rather than chronological dates) between the death of Bacon\r\nand the publication of _Absalom and Achitophel_, there existed in England a\r\nquintet of men of letters, of such extraordinary power and individuality,\r\nthat it may be doubted whether any other period of our own literature can\r\nshow a group equal to them; while it is certain that no other literature,\r\nexcept, perhaps, in the age of Pericles, can match them. They were all,\r\nexcept Hobbes (who belonged by birth, though not by date and character of\r\nwriting, to an earlier generation than the rest), born, and they all died,\r\nwithin a very few years of each other. All were prose writers of the very\r\nhighest merit; and though only one was a poet, yet he had poetry enough to\r\nspare for all the five. Of the others, Clarendon, in some of the greatest\r\ncharacteristics of the historian, has been equalled by no Englishman, and\r\nsurpassed by few foreigners. Jeremy Taylor has been called the most\r\neloquent of men; and if this is a bold saying, it is scarcely too bold.\r\nHobbes stands with Bacon and Berkeley at the head of English-speaking\r\nphilosophers, and is, if not in general grasp, in range of ideas, or in\r\nliterary polish, yet in acuteness of thought and originality of expression,\r\nperhaps the superior of both his companions. The excellence of Browne is\r\nindeed more purely literary and intensely artistic first of all--a matter\r\nof expression rather than of substance,--while he is perhaps more flawed\r\nthan any of them by the fashionable vices of his time. Yet, as an artist,\r\nor rather architect, of words in the composite and florid style, it is vain\r\nto look anywhere for his superior.\r\n\r\nJohn Milton--the greatest, no doubt, of the five, if only because of his\r\nmastery of either harmony--was born in London on 9th December 1608, was\r\neducated at Cambridge, studied at home with unusual intensity and control\r\nof his own time and bent; travelled to Italy, returned, and engaged in the\r\nsomewhat unexpected task of school-keeping; was stimulated, by the outbreak\r\nof the disturbances between king and parliament, to take part with\r\nextraordinary bitterness in the strife of pamphlets on the republican and\r\nanti-prelatical side, defended the execution of the king in his capacity of\r\nLatin secretary to the Government (to which he had been appointed in 1649);\r\nwas struck with blindness, lay hid at the Restoration for some time in\r\norder to escape the Royalist vengeance (which does not seem very seriously\r\nto have threatened him), composed and published in 1667 the great poem of\r\n_Paradise Lost_, followed it with that of _Paradise Regained_, did not a\r\nlittle other work in prose and poetry, and died on 8th November 1674. He\r\nhad been thrice married, and his first wife had left him within a month of\r\nher marriage, thereby occasioning the singular series of pamphlets on\r\ndivorce, the theories of which, had she not returned, he had, it is said,\r\nintended to put into practice on his own responsibility. The general\r\nabstinence from all but the barest biographical outline which the scale of\r\nthis book imposes is perhaps nowhere a greater gain than in the case of\r\nMilton. His personal character was, owing to political motives, long\r\ntreated with excessive rigour. The reaction to Liberal politics early in\r\nthe nineteenth century substituted for this rigour a somewhat excessive\r\nadmiration, and even now the balance is hardly restored, as may be seen\r\nfrom the fact that a late biographer of his stigmatises his first wife, the\r\nunfortunate Mary Powell, as \"a dull and common girl,\" without a tittle of\r\nevidence except the bare fact of her difference with her husband, and some\r\ninnuendoes (indirect in themselves, and clearly tainted as testimony) in\r\nMilton's own divorce tracts. On the whole, Milton's character was not an\r\namiable one, nor even wholly estimable. It is probable that he never in the\r\ncourse of his whole life did anything that he considered wrong; but\r\nunfortunately, examples are not far to seek of the facility with which\r\ndesire can be made to confound itself with deliberate approval. That he was\r\nan exacting, if not a tyrannical husband and father, that he held in the\r\nmost peremptory and exaggerated fashion the doctrine of the superiority of\r\nman to woman, that his egotism in a man who had actually accomplished less\r\nwould be half ludicrous and half disgusting, that his faculty of\r\nappreciation beyond his own immediate tastes and interests was small, that\r\nhis intolerance surpassed that of an inquisitor, and that his controversial\r\nhabits and manners outdid the license even of that period of controversial\r\nabuse,--these are propositions which I cannot conceive to be disputed by\r\nany competent critic aware of the facts. If they have ever been denied, it\r\nis merely from the amiable but uncritical point of view which blinks all a\r\nman's personal defects in consideration of his literary genius. That we\r\ncannot afford to do here, especially as Milton's personal defects had no\r\nsmall influence on his literary character. But having honestly set down his\r\nfaults, let us now turn to the pleasanter side of the subject without fear\r\nof having to revert, except cursorily, to the uglier.\r\n\r\nThe same prejudice and partisanship, however, which have coloured the\r\nestimate of Milton's personal character have a little injured the literary\r\nestimate of him. It is agreed on all hands that Johnson's acute but unjust\r\ncriticism was directed as much by political and religious prejudice as by\r\nthe operation of narrow and mistaken rules of prosody and poetry; and all\r\nthese causes worked together to produce that extraordinary verdict on\r\n_Lycidas_, which has been thought unintelligible. But it would be idle to\r\ncontend that there is not nearly as much bias on the other side in the most\r\nglowing of his modern panegyrists--Macaulay and Landor. It is, no doubt, in\r\nregard to a champion so formidable, both as ally and as enemy, difficult\r\nto write without fear or favour, but it must be attempted.\r\n\r\nMilton's periods of literary production were three. In each of them he\r\nproduced work of the highest literary merit, but at the same time\r\nsingularly different in kind. In the first, covering the first thirty years\r\nof his life, he wrote no prose worth speaking of, but after juvenile\r\nefforts, and besides much Latin poetry of merit, produced the exquisite\r\npoems of _L'Allegro_ and _Il Penseroso_, the _Hymn on the Nativity_, the\r\nincomparable _Lycidas_, the _Comus_ (which I have the audacity to think his\r\ngreatest work, if scale and merit are considered), and the delicious\r\nfragments of the _Arcades_. Then his style abruptly changed, and for\r\nanother twenty years he devoted himself chiefly to polemical pamphlets,\r\nrelieved only by a few sonnets, whose strong originality and intensely\r\npersonal savour are uniform, while their poetical merit varies greatly. The\r\nthird period of fifteen years saw the composition of the great epics of\r\n_Paradise Lost_ and _Paradise Regained_, and of the tragedy of _Samson\r\nAgonistes_, together with at least the completion of a good deal of prose,\r\nincluding a curious _History of England_, wherein Milton expatiates with a\r\nsingular gusto over details which he must have known, and indeed allows\r\nthat he knew, to be fabulous. The production of each of these periods may\r\nbe advantageously dealt with separately and in order.\r\n\r\nMilton's Latin compositions both in prose and verse lie rather outside of\r\nour scope, though they afford a very interesting subject. It is perhaps\r\nsufficient to say that critics of such different times, tempers, and\r\nattitudes towards their subject as Johnson and the late Rector of\r\nLincoln,--critics who agree in nothing except literary competence,--are\r\npractically at one as to the remarkable excellence of Milton's Latin verse\r\nat its best. It is little read now, but it is a pity that any one who can\r\nread Latin should allow himself to be ignorant of at least the beautiful\r\n_Epitaphium Damonis_ on the poet's friend, Charles Diodati.\r\n\r\nThe dates of the few but exquisite poems of the first period are known with\r\nsome but not complete exactness. Milton was not an extremely precocious\r\npoet, and such early exercises as he has preserved deserve the description\r\nof being rather meritorious than remarkable. But in 1629, his year of\r\ndiscretion, he struck his own note first and firmly with the hymn on the\r\n\"Nativity.\" Two years later the beautiful sonnet on his three-and-twentieth\r\nyear followed. _L'Allegro_ and _Il Penseroso_ date not before, but probably\r\nnot much after, 1632; _Comus_ dating from 1634, and _Lycidas_ from 1637.\r\nAll these were written either in the later years at Cambridge, or in the\r\nperiod of independent study at Horton in Buckinghamshire--chiefly in the\r\nlatter. Almost every line and word of these poems has been commented on and\r\nfought over, and I cannot undertake to summarise the criticism of others.\r\nAmong the greater memorabilia of the subject is that wonderful Johnsonism,\r\nthe description of _Lycidas_ as \"harsh, the rhymes uncertain, and the\r\nnumbers unpleasing;\" among the minor, the fact that critics have gravely\r\nquarrelled among themselves over the epithet \"monumental\" applied to the\r\noak in _Il Penseroso_, when Spenser's \"Builder Oak\" (Milton was a\r\npassionate student of Spenser) would have given them the key at once, even\r\nif the same phrase had not occurred, as I believe it does, in Chaucer, also\r\na favourite of Milton's. We have only space here for first-hand criticism.\r\n\r\nThis body of work, then, is marked by two qualities: an extraordinary\r\ndegree of poetic merit, and a still more extraordinary originality of\r\npoetic kind. Although Milton is always Milton, it would be difficult to\r\nfind in another writer five poems, or (taking the _Allegro_ and its\r\ncompanion together) four, so different from each other and yet of such high\r\nmerit. And it would be still more difficult to find poems so independent in\r\ntheir excellence. Neither the influence of Jonson nor the influence of\r\nDonne--the two poetical influences in the air at the time, and the latter\r\nespecially strong at Cambridge--produced even the faintest effect on\r\nMilton. We know from his own words, and should have known even if he had\r\nnot mentioned it, that Shakespere and Spenser were his favourite studies in\r\nEnglish; yet, save in mere scattered phrases none of these poems owes\r\nanything to either. He has teachers but no models; masters, but only in the\r\nway of learning how to do, not what to do. The \"certain vital marks,\" of\r\nwhich he somewhat arrogantly speaks, are indeed there. I do not myself see\r\nthem least in the poem on the \"Nativity,\" which has been the least general\r\nfavourite. It shows youth in a certain inequality, in a slight overdose of\r\nornament, and especially in a very inartistic conclusion. But nowhere even\r\nin Milton does the mastery of harmonies appear better than in the exquisite\r\nrhythmical arrangement of the piece, in the almost unearthly beauty of the\r\nexordium, and in the famous stanzas beginning \"The oracles are dumb.\" It\r\nmust be remembered that at this time English lyric was in a very\r\nrudimentary and ill-organised condition. The exquisite snatches in the\r\ndramatists had been snatches merely; Spenser and his followers had chiefly\r\nconfined themselves to elaborate stanzas of full length lines, and\r\nelsewhere the octo-syllabic couplet, or the quatrain, or the dangerous\r\n\"eights and sixes,\" had been chiefly affected. The sestines and canzons and\r\nmadrigals of the sonneteers, for all the beauty of their occasional\r\nflashes, have nothing like the gracious and sustained majesty of the\r\n\"Nativity\" piece. For technical perfection in lyric metre, that is not so\r\nmuch to be sung as said, this ode has no precedent rival. As for\r\n_L'Allegro_ and _Il Penseroso_, who shall praise them fitly? They are among\r\nthe few things about which there is no difference of opinion, which are as\r\ndelightful to childhood as to criticism, to youth as to age. To dwell on\r\ntheir technical excellences (the chief of which is the unerring precision\r\nwith which the catalectic and acatalectic lines are arranged and\r\ninterchanged) has a certain air of impertinence about it. Even a critical\r\nKing Alfonso El Sabio could hardly think it possible that Milton might have\r\ntaken a hint here, although some persons have, it seems, been disturbed\r\nbecause skylarks do not come to the window, just as others are troubled\r\nbecause the flowers in _Lycidas_ do not grow at the same time, and because\r\nthey think they could see stars through the \"star-proof\" trees of the\r\n_Arcades_.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of the masque just mentioned consist only of three songs and\r\nan address in rhymed couplets. Of the songs, those ending--\r\n\r\n      Such a rural queen,\r\n    All Arcadia hath not seen,\r\n\r\nare equal to anything that Milton has done; the first song and the address,\r\nespecially the latter, do not fall far below them. But it is in _Comus_\r\nthat, if I have any skill of criticism, Milton's poetical power is at its\r\ngreatest height. Those who judge poetry on the ground of bulk, or of\r\noriginality of theme, or of anything else extra-poetical,--much more those\r\n(the greater number) who simply vary transmitted ideas,--may be scandalised\r\nat this assertion, but that will hardly matter much. And indeed the\r\nindebtedness of _Comus_ in point of subject (it is probably limited to the\r\nOdyssey, which is public property, and to George Peele's _Old Wives' Tale_,\r\nwhich gave little but a few hints of story) is scarcely greater than that\r\nof _Paradise Lost_; while the form of the drama, a kind nearly as venerable\r\nand majestic as that of the epic, is completely filled. And in _Comus_\r\nthere is none of the stiffness, none of the _longueurs_, none of the almost\r\nludicrous want of humour, which mar the larger poem. Humour indeed was what\r\nMilton always lacked; had he had it, Shakespere himself might hardly have\r\nbeen greater. The plan is not really more artificial than that of the epic;\r\nthough in the latter case it is masked to us by the scale, by the grandeur\r\nof the personages, and by the familiarity of the images to all men who have\r\nbeen brought up on the Bible. The versification, as even Johnson saw, is\r\nthe versification of _Paradise Lost_, and to my fancy at any rate it has a\r\nspring, a variety, a sweep and rush of genius, which are but rarely present\r\nlater. As for its beauty in parts, _quis vituperavit_? It is impossible to\r\nsingle out passages, for the whole is golden. The entering address of\r\nComus, the song \"Sweet Echo,\" the descriptive speech of the Spirit, and the\r\nmagnificent eulogy of the \"sun-clad power of chastity,\" would be the most\r\nbeautiful things where all is beautiful, if the unapproachable \"Sabrina\r\nfair\" did not come later, and were not sustained before and after, for\r\nnearly two hundred lines of pure nectar. If poetry could be taught by the\r\nreading of it, then indeed the critic's advice to a poet might be limited\r\nto this: \"Give your days and nights to the reading of _Comus_.\"\r\n\r\nThe sole excuses for Johnson's amazing verdict on _Lycidas_ are that it is\r\nnot quite so uniformly good, and that in his strictures on its \"rhyme\" and\r\n\"numbers\" he was evidently speaking from the point of view at which the\r\nregular couplet is regarded as the _ne plus ultra_ of poetry. There are\r\nindeed blotches in it. The speech of Peter, magnificently as it is\r\nintroduced, and strangely as it has captivated some critics, who seem to\r\nthink that anything attacking the Church of England must be poetry, is out\r\nof place, and in itself is obscure, pedantic, and grotesque. There is some\r\nover-classicism, and the scale of the piece does not admit the display of\r\nquite such sustained and varied power as in _Comus_. But what there is, is\r\nso exquisite that hardly can we find fault with Mr. Pattison's hyperbole\r\nwhen he called _Lycidas_ the \"high-water mark of English poetry.\"\r\nHigh-water mark even in the physical world is a variable limit. Shakespere\r\nconstantly, and some other poets here and there in short passages go beyond\r\nMilton. But in the same space we shall nowhere find anything that can outgo\r\nthe passage beginning \"Alas what boots it,\" down to \"head of thine,\" and\r\nthe whole conclusion from \"Return Alpheus.\" For melody of versification,\r\nfor richness of images, for curious felicity of expression, these cannot be\r\nsurpassed.\r\n\r\n\"But O the heavy change\"--to use an irresistible quotation, the more\r\nirresistible that the change is foreshadowed in _Lycidas_ itself--from the\r\ngolden poetry of these early days to the prose of the pamphlets. It is not\r\nthat Milton's literary faculty is less conspicuous here, or less\r\ninteresting. There is no English prose before him, none save Taylor's and\r\nBrowne's in his time, and absolutely none after him that can compare with\r\nthe finest passages of these singular productions. The often quoted\r\npersonal descriptions of his aims in life, his early literary studies, his\r\nviews of poetry and so forth, are almost equal in the \"other harmony of\r\nprose\" to _Comus_ and _Lycidas_. The deservedly famous _Areopagitica_ is\r\nfull of the most splendid concerted pieces of prose-music, and hardly\r\nanywhere from the _Tractate of Reformation Touching Church Discipline_ to\r\nthe _History of Britain_, which he revised just before his death, is it\r\npossible to read a page without coming across phrases, passages, and even\r\nwhole paragraphs, which are instinct with the most splendid life. But the\r\ndifference between Milton's poetry and his prose is, that in verse he is\r\nconstantly under the restraint (sometimes, in his later work especially,\r\ntoo much under the restraint) of the sense of style; while in his prose he\r\nseems to be wholly emancipated from it. Even in his finest passages he\r\nnever seems to know or to care how a period is going to end. He piles\r\nclause on clause, links conjunction to conjunction, regardless of breath,\r\nor sense, or the most ordinary laws of grammar. The second sentence of his\r\nfirst prose work contains about four hundred words, and is broken in the\r\ncourse of them like a wounded snake. In his very highest flights he will\r\nsuddenly drop to grotesque and bathos; and there is no more difficult task\r\n(_haud inexpertus loquor_) than the selection from Milton of any passage of\r\nlength which shall not contain faults of which a modern schoolboy or\r\ngutter-journalist would be ashamed. Nor is the matter made much better by\r\nthe consideration that it is not so much ignorance as temper which is the\r\ncause of this deformity. Lest it be thought that I speak harshly, let me\r\nquote from the late Mr. Mark Pattison, a strong sympathiser with Milton's\r\npolitics, in complete agreement if not with his religious views, yet with\r\nhis attitude towards dominant ecclesiasticism, and almost an idolater of\r\nhim from the purely literary point of view. In \"_Eikonoclastes_,\" Milton's\r\nreply to _Eikon Basilike_, Mr. Pattison says, and I do not care to attempt\r\nany improvement on the words, \"Milton is worse than tedious: his reply is\r\nin a tone of rude railing and insolent swagger which would have been always\r\nunbecoming, but which at this moment was grossly indecent.\" Elsewhere (and\r\nagain I have nothing to add) Mr. Pattison describes Milton's prose\r\npamphlets as \"a plunge into the depths of vulgar scurrility and libel\r\nbelow the level of average gentility and education.\" But the Rector of\r\nLincoln has not touched, or has touched very lightly, on the fault above\r\nnoted, the profound lack of humour that these pamphlets display. Others\r\nhave been as scurrilous, as libellous, as unfair; others have prostituted\r\nliterary genius to the composition of paid lampoons; but some at least of\r\nthem have been saved by the all-saving sense of humour. As any one who\r\nremembers the dreadful passage about the guns in _Paradise Lost_ must know,\r\nthe book of humour was to Milton a sealed book. He has flashes of wit,\r\nthough not many; his indignation of itself sometimes makes him really\r\nsarcastic. But humorous he is never.\r\n\r\nDestitute of this, the one saving grace of polemical literature, he plunged\r\nat the age of thirty-three into pamphlet writing. With a few exceptions his\r\nproduction in this kind may be thrown into four classes,--the\r\n_Areopagitica_ and the _Letter to Hartlib_ (much the best of the whole)\r\nstanding outside. The first class attacks prelatical government, and by\r\ndegrees glides, under the guise of apologetics for the famous\r\n_Smectymnuus_, into a fierce and indecent controversy with Bishop Hall,\r\ncontaining some of the worst examples of the author's deplorable inability\r\nto be jocular. Then comes the divorce series, which, with all its varied\r\nlearning, is chiefly comic, owing to Milton's unfortunate blindness to the\r\nfact that he was trying to make a public question out of private grievances\r\nof the particular kind which most of all demand silence. Next rank the\r\npieces composing the Apologia of regicide, the _Eikonoclastes_, the\r\ncontroversy with Salmasius (written in Latin), and the postscript thereto,\r\ndevoted to the obscure Morus. And lastly come the pamphlets in which, with\r\nsingular want of understanding of the course of events, Milton tried to\r\nargue Monk and the weary nation out of the purpose to shake off the heavy\r\nyoke of so-called liberty. The _History of Britain_, the very agreeable\r\nfragment on the _History of Muscovy_, the late _Treatise Against Popery_,\r\nin which the author holds out a kind of olive branch to the Church of\r\nEngland, in the very act of proclaiming his Arianism, and the two little\r\nmasterpieces already referred to, are independent of any such\r\nclassification. Yet even in them sometimes, as always in the others, _furor\r\narma ministrat_; and supplies them as badly as if he were supplying by\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\nNevertheless both Milton's faults and his merits as a prose writer are of\r\nthe most remarkable and interesting character. The former consist chiefly\r\nin the reckless haste with which he constructs (or rather altogether\r\nneglects the construction of) his periods and sentences, in an occasional\r\nconfusion of those rules of Latin syntax which are only applicable to a\r\nfully inflected language with the rules necessary in a language so\r\ndestitute of inflections as English, and in a lavish and sometimes both\r\nneedless and tasteless adaptation of Latin words. All these were faults of\r\nthe time, but it is true that they are faults which Milton, like his\r\ncontemporaries Taylor and Browne, aggravated almost wilfully. Of the three\r\nMilton, owing no doubt to the fury which animated him, is by far the most\r\nfaulty and uncritical. Taylor is the least remarkable of the three for\r\nclassicisms either of syntax or vocabulary; and Browne's excesses in this\r\nrespect are deliberate. Milton's are the effect of blind passion. Yet the\r\npassages which diversify and relieve his prose works are far more beautiful\r\nin their kind than anything to be found elsewhere in English prose. Though\r\nhe never trespasses into purely poetical rhythm, the solemn music of his\r\nown best verse is paralleled in these; and the rugged and grandiose\r\nvocabulary (it is particularly characteristic of Milton that he mixes the\r\nextremest vernacular with the most exquisite and scholarly phrasing) is\r\nfused and moulded with an altogether extraordinary power. Nor can we notice\r\nless the abundance of striking phrase, now quaint, now grand, now forcible,\r\nwhich in short clauses and \"jewels five words long\" occurs constantly, even\r\nin the passages least artistically finished as wholes. There is no English\r\nprose author whose prose is so constantly racy with such a distinct and\r\nvaried savour as Milton's. It is hardly possible to open him anywhere after\r\nthe fashion of the _Sortes Virgilianae_ without lighting on a line or a\r\ncouple of lines, which for the special purpose it is impossible to improve.\r\nAnd it might be contended with some plausibility that this abundance of\r\njewels, or purple patches, brings into rather unfair prominence the slips\r\nof grammar and taste, the inequalities of thought, the deplorable attempts\r\nto be funny, the rude outbursts of bargee invective, which also occur so\r\nnumerously. One other peculiarity, or rather one result of these\r\npeculiarities, remains to be noticed; and that is that Milton's prose is\r\nessentially inimitable. It would be difficult even to caricature or to\r\nparody it; and to imitate it as his verse, at least his later verse, has\r\nbeen so often imitated, is simply impossible.\r\n\r\nThe third and, in popular estimation, the most important period of Milton's\r\nproduction was again poetical. The characteristics of the poetry of the\r\nthree great works which illustrate it are admittedly uniform, though in\r\n_Samson Agonistes_ they exhibit themselves in a harder, drier, more\r\nossified form than in the two great epics. This relation is only a\r\nrepetition of the relation between _Paradise Lost_ and _Paradise Regained_\r\nthemselves on the one hand, and the poems of twenty years earlier,\r\nespecially _Comus_ and _Lycidas_, on the other. The wonderful Miltonic\r\nstyle, so artificial and yet such a triumph of art, is evident even so\r\nearly as the ode on the \"Nativity,\" and it merely developed its own\r\ncharacteristics up to the _Samson_ of forty years later. That it is a real\r\nstyle and not merely a trick, like so many others, is best shown by the\r\nfact that it is very hard, if not impossible, to analyse it finally into\r\nelements. The common opinion charges Milton with Latinising heavily; and so\r\nhe does. But we open _Paradise Lost_ at random, and we find a dozen lines,\r\nand not the least beautiful (the Third Day of Creation), without a word in\r\nthem that is not perfectly simple English, or if of Latin origin,\r\nnaturalised long before Milton's time, while the syntax is also quite\r\nvernacular. Again it is commonly thought that the habits of antithesis and\r\nparallelism, of omission of articles, of reversing the position of\r\nadjectives and adverbs, are specially Miltonic. Certainly Milton often\r\nindulges in them; yet in the same way the most random dipping will find\r\npassages (and any number of them) where no one of these habits is\r\nparticularly or eminently present, and yet which every one would recognise\r\nas Miltonic. As far as it is possible to put the finger on one peculiarity\r\nwhich explains part of the secret of Milton's pre-eminence, I should myself\r\nselect his unapproached care and felicity in building what may be called\r\nthe verse-paragraph. The dangers of blank verse (Milton's preference for\r\nwhich over rhyme was only one of his numerous will-worships) are many; but\r\nthe two greatest lie in easily understood directions. With the sense\r\ngenerally or frequently ending as the line ends (as may be seen in the\r\nearly dramatists and in many bad poets since), it becomes intolerably stiff\r\nand monotonous. With the process of _enjambement_ or overlapping,\r\npromiscuously and unskilfully indulged (the commonest fault during the last\r\ntwo centuries), it is apt to degenerate into a kind of metrical and barely\r\nmetrical prose, distinguished from prose proper by less variety of cadence,\r\nand by an occasional awkward sacrifice of sense and natural arrangement to\r\nthe restrictions which the writer accepts, but by which he knows not how to\r\nprofit. Milton has avoided both these dangers by adhering to what I have\r\nventured to call the verse-paragraph--that is to say, by arranging the\r\ndivisions of his sense in divisions of verse, which, albeit identical and\r\nnot different in their verse integers, are constructed with as much\r\ninternal concerted variety as the stanzas or strophes of a so-called\r\nPindaric ode. Of the apparently uniform and monotonous blank verse he has\r\nmade an instrument of almost protean variety by availing himself of the\r\ninfinite permutations of cadence, syllabic sound, variety of feet, and\r\nadjustment of sense to verse. The result is that he has, it may almost be\r\nsaid, made for himself out of simple blank verse all the conveniences of\r\nthe line, the couplet, and the stanza, punctuating and dividing by cadence,\r\nnot rhyme. No device that is possible within his limits--even to that most\r\ndangerous one of the pause after the first syllable of a line which has\r\n\"enjambed\" from the previous one--is strange to him, or sparingly used by\r\nhim, or used without success. And it is only necessary to contrast his\r\nverse with the blank verse of the next century, especially in its two chief\r\nexamples, Thomson and Young,--great verse-smiths both of them,--to observe\r\nhis superiority in art. These two, especially Thomson, try the\r\nverse-paragraph system, but they do it ostentatiously and clumsily.\r\nThomson's trick of ending such paragraphs with such lines as \"And Thule\r\nbellows through her utmost isles,\" often repeated with only verbal\r\nsubstitutions, is apt to make the reader think with a smile of the breath\r\nof relief which a man draws after a serious effort. \"Thank heaven that\r\nparagraph's done!\" the poet seems to be saying. Nothing of the kind is ever\r\nto be found in Milton. It is only on examination that the completeness of\r\nthese divisions is perceived. They are linked one to another with the same\r\nincomparably artful concealment of art which links their several and\r\ninternal clauses. And thus it is that Milton is able to carry his readers\r\nthrough (taking both poems together) sixteen books of epic, without much\r\nnarrative interest, with foregone conclusions, with long passages which are\r\nmerely versifications of well-known themes, and with others which the most\r\nfavourable critics admit to be, if not exactly dull, yet certainly not\r\nlively. Something the same may be said of _Samson_, though here a decided\r\nstiffening and mannerising of the verse is to some extent compensated by\r\nthe pathetic and human interest of the story. It is to be observed,\r\nhowever, that Milton has here abused the redundant syllable (the chief\r\npurely poetical mistake of which he has been guilty in any part of his\r\nwork, and which is partly noticeable in _Comus_), and that his choric odes\r\nare but dry sticks in comparison with _Lycidas_.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought strange that I should say little or nothing of the\r\nsubject of these immortal poems. But, in the first place, those critics of\r\npoetry who tell us that \"all depends on the subject\" seem to forget that,\r\naccording to this singular dictum, there is no difference between poetry\r\nand prose--between an epic and a blue-book. I prefer--having been brought\r\nup at the feet of Logic--to stick to the genus and differentia of poetry,\r\nand not to its accidents. Moreover, the matter of _Paradise Lost_ and its\r\nsequel is so universally known that it becomes unnecessary, and has been so\r\nmuch discussed that it seems superfluous, to rediscuss it. The inquiries\r\ninto Milton's indebtedness to forerunners strike me as among the idlest\r\ninquiries of the kind--which is saying a great deal. Italians, Frenchmen,\r\nDutchmen, Englishmen even, had doubtless treated the Creation and the Fall,\r\nAdam and Satan, before him. Perhaps he read them; perhaps he borrowed from\r\nthem. What then? Does any one believe that Andreini or Vondel, Sylvester or\r\nDu Bartas, could have written, or did in any measurable degree contribute\r\nto the writing of _Paradise Lost_? If he does he must be left to his\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nReference may perhaps be made to some remarks in Chapter IV. on the\r\ncomparative position of Milton in English poetry with the only two writers\r\nwho can be compared to him, if bulk and majesty of work be taken into\r\nconsideration, and not merely occasional bursts of poetry. Of his own\r\npoetical powers I trust that I shall not be considered a niggard admirer,\r\nbecause, both in the character of its subject (if we are to consider\r\nsubjects at all) and in its employment of rhyme, that greatest mechanical\r\naid of the poet, _The Faerie Queene_ seems to me greater, or because\r\nMilton's own earlier work seems to me to rank higher than _Paradise Lost_.\r\nThe general opinion is, of course, different; and one critic of no mean\r\nrepute, Christopher North, has argued that _Paradise Lost_ is the only\r\n\"great poem\" in existence. That question need not be argued here. It is\r\nsufficient to say that Milton is undoubtedly one of the few great poets in\r\nthe history of the world, and that if he falls short of Homer, Dante, and\r\nShakespere, it is chiefly because he expresses less of that humanity, both\r\nuniversal and quintessential, which they, and especially the last, put into\r\nverse. Narrowness is his fault. But the intense individuality which often\r\naccompanies narrowness is his great virtue--a virtue which no poet, which\r\nno writer either in verse or prose, has ever had in greater measure than\r\nhe, and which hardly any has been able to express with more varied and\r\nexquisite harmony.\r\n\r\nJeremy Taylor, the ornament and glory of the English pulpit, was born at\r\nCambridge in 1613. He was the son of a barber, but was well educated, and\r\nwas able to enter Caius College as a sizar at thirteen. He spent seven\r\nyears there, and took both degrees and orders at an unusually early age.\r\nApparently, however, no solid endowment was offered him in his own\r\nuniversity, and he owed such preferment as he had (it was never very great)\r\nto a chance opportunity of preaching at St. Paul's and a recommendation to\r\nLaud. That prelate--to whom all the infinite malignity of political and\r\nsectarian detraction has not been able to deny the title of an encourager,\r\nas few men have encouraged them, of learning and piety--took Taylor under\r\nhis protection, made him his chaplain, and procured him incorporation at\r\nOxford, a fellowship at All Souls, and finally the rectory of Uppingham. To\r\nthis Taylor was appointed in 1638, and next year he married a lady who bore\r\nhim several sons, but died young. Taylor early joined the king at Oxford,\r\nand is supposed to have followed his fortunes in the field; it is certain\r\nthat his rectory, lying in a Puritan district, was very soon sequestrated,\r\nthough not by any form of law. What took him into Wales and caused him to\r\nmarry his second wife, Joanna Brydges (an heiress on a small scale, and\r\nsaid to have been a natural daughter of Charles I.), is not known. But he\r\nsojourned in the principality during the greater part of the Commonwealth\r\nperiod, and was much patronised by the Earl of Carbery, who, while resident\r\nat Golden Grove, made him his chaplain. He also made the acquaintance of\r\nother persons of interest, the chief of whom were, in London (which he\r\nvisited not always of his own choice, for he was more than once\r\nimprisoned), John Evelyn, and in Wales, Mrs. Katherine Philips, \"the\r\nmatchless Orinda,\" to whom he dedicated one of the most interesting of his\r\nminor works, the _Measure and Offices of Friendship_. Not long before the\r\nRestoration he was offered, and strongly pressed to accept, the post of\r\nlecturer at Lisburn, in Ireland. He does not seem to have taken at all\r\nkindly to the notion, but was over-persuaded, and crossed the Channel. It\r\nwas perhaps owing to this false step that, when the Restoration arrived,\r\nthe preferment which he had in so many ways merited only came to him in the\r\ntents of Kedar. He was made Bishop of Down and Connor, held that see for\r\nseven years, and died (after much wrestling with Ulster Presbyterians and\r\nsome domestic misfortune) of fever in 1667.\r\n\r\nHis work is voluminous and always interesting; but only a small part of it\r\nconcerns us directly here, as exhibiting him at his best and most peculiar\r\nin the management of English prose. He wrote, it should be said, a few\r\nverses by no means destitute of merit, but they are so few, in comparison\r\nto the bulk of his work, that they may be neglected. Taylor's strong point\r\nwas not accuracy of statement or logical precision. His longest work, the\r\n_Ductor Dubitantium_, an elaborate manual of casuistry, is constantly\r\nmarred by the author's inability to fix on a single point, and to keep his\r\nargumentation close to that. In another, the _Unum Necessarium_, or\r\nDiscourse on Repentance, his looseness of statement and want of care in\r\ndriving several horses at once, involved him in a charge of Pelagianism, or\r\nsomething like it, which he wrote much to disprove, but which has so far\r\nlasted as to justify modern theologians in regarding his ideas on this and\r\nother theological points as, to say the least, confused. All over his work\r\ninexact quotation from memory, illicit argumentation, and an abiding\r\ninconsistency, mar the intellectual value, affecting not least his famous\r\n_Liberty of Prophesying_, or plea for toleration against the new\r\nPresbyterian uniformity,--the conformity of which treatise with modern\r\nideas has perhaps made some persons slow to recognise its faults. These\r\nshortcomings, however, are not more constant in Taylor's work than his\r\ngenuine piety, his fervent charity, his freedom from personal arrogance and\r\npretentiousness, and his ardent love for souls; while neither shortcomings\r\nnor virtues of this kind concern us here so much as the extraordinary\r\nrhetorical merits which distinguish all his work more or less, and which\r\nare chiefly noticeable in his Sermons, especially the Golden Grove course,\r\nand the funeral sermon on Lady Carbery, in his _Contemplations of the State\r\nof Man_, and in parts of his _Life of Christ_, and of the universally\r\npopular and admirable tractates on _Holy Living_ and _Holy Dying_.\r\n\r\nJeremy Taylor's style is emphatically and before all things florid and\r\nornate. It is not so elaborately quaint as Browne's; it is not so stiffly\r\nsplendid as Milton's; it is distinguished from both by a much less\r\nadmixture of Latinisms; but it is impossible to call it either verbally\r\nchastened or syntactically correct. Coleridge--an authority always to be\r\ndiffered with cautiously and under protest--holds indeed a different\r\nopinion. He will have it that Browne was the corruptor, though a corruptor\r\nof the greatest genius, in point of vocabulary, and that, as far as syntax\r\nis concerned, in Jeremy Taylor the sentences are often extremely long, and\r\nyet are generally so perspicuous in consequence of their logical structure\r\nthat they require no reperusal to be understood. And he will have the same\r\nto be true not only of Hooker (which may pass), but of Milton, in reference\r\nto whom admirers not less strong than Coleridge hold that he sometimes\r\nforgets the period altogether.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that Coleridge in these remarks was fighting the\r\nbattle of the recoverers of our great seventeenth century writers against\r\nthe devotees of \"correctness,\" and that in the very same context he makes\r\nthe unpardonable assertion that Gibbon's manner is \"the worst of all,\" and\r\nthat Tacitus \"writes in falsetto as compared to Tully.\" This is to \"fight a\r\nprize\" in the old phrase, not to judge from the catholic and universal\r\nstandpoint of impartial criticism; and in order to reduce Coleridge's\r\nassertions to that standard we must abate nearly as much from his praise of\r\nTaylor as from his abuse of Gibbon--an abuse, by the way, which is\r\nstrangely contrasted with praise of \"Junius.\" It is not true that, except\r\nby great complaisance of the reader, Jeremy Taylor's long sentences are at\r\nonce understandable. They may, of course, and generally can be understood\r\n_kata to semaino menon_, as a telegram with half the words left out may at\r\nthe other end of the scale be understood. But they constantly withstand\r\neven a generous parser, even one who is to the fullest extent ready to\r\nallow for idiom and individuality. They abuse in particular the conjunction\r\nto a most enormous extent--coupling by its means propositions which have no\r\nlogical connection, which start entirely different trains of thought, and\r\nwhich are only united because carelessness and fashion combined made it\r\nunnecessary for the writer to take the little extra trouble necessary for\r\ntheir separation. Taylor will, in the very middle of his finest passages,\r\nand with hardly so much as a comma's break, change _oratio obliqua_ to\r\n_oratio recta_, interrupt the sequence of tenses, make his verbs agree with\r\nthe nearest noun, irrespective of the connection, and in short, though he\r\nwas, while in Wales, a schoolmaster for some time, and author of a\r\ngrammatical treatise, will break Priscian's head with the calmest\r\nunconcern. It is quite true that these faults mainly occur in his more\r\nrhetorical passages, in his exercises rather of spoken than of written\r\nprose. But that, as any critic who is not an advocate must see, is no\r\npalliation. The real palliation is that the time had not yet aroused itself\r\nto the consciousness of the fact that letting English grammar at one moment\r\ngo to the winds altogether, and at the next subjecting it to the most\r\ninappropriate rules and licenses of Latin, was not the way to secure the\r\nestablishment of an accomplished and generally useful English prose. No\r\nstranger instance of prejudice can be given than that Coleridge, on the\r\npoint of asking, and justly, from Dryden \"a stricter grammar,\" should exalt\r\nto the skies a writer compared to whom Dryden is grammatically impeccable.\r\n\r\nBut a recognition of the fact that Taylor distinctly belongs to the\r\nantinomians of English prose, or at least to those guiltless heathens who\r\nlived before the laws of it had been asserted, can not in any competent\r\ncritic dull the sense of the wonderful beauty of his style. It has been\r\nsaid that this beauty is entirely of the florid and ornate order, lending\r\nitself in this way easily enough to the witty and well-worded, though\r\nunjust and ungenerous censure which South pronounced on it after the\r\nauthor's death. It may or may not be that the phrases there censured, \"The\r\nfringes of the north star,\" and \"The dew of angels' wings,\" and \"Thus have\r\nI seen a cloud rolling in its airy mansion,\" are not of that \"apostolic\r\nplainness\" that a Christian minister's speech should have. But they and\r\ntheir likes are extremely beautiful--save that in literature no less than\r\nin theology South has justly perstringed Taylor's constant and most\r\nunworthy affectation of introducing a simile by \"so I have seen.\" In the\r\nnext age the phrase was tediously abused, and in the age after, and ever\r\nsince, it became and has remained mere burlesque; but it was never good;\r\nand in the two fine specimen passages which follow it is a distinct blot:--\r\n\r\n     _The Prayers of Anger and of Lust._\r\n\r\n     \"Prayer is the peace of our spirit, the stillness of our\r\n     thoughts, the evenness of recollection, the seat of meditation,\r\n     the rest of our cares, and the calm of our tempest. Prayer is the\r\n     issue of a quiet mind, of untroubled thoughts; it is the daughter\r\n     of charity and the sister of meekness; and he that prays to God\r\n     with an angry--that is a troubled and discomposed--spirit, is\r\n     like him that retires into a battle to meditate and sets up his\r\n     closet in the outquarters of an army, and chooses a frontier\r\n     garrison to be wise in. Anger is a perfect alienation of the mind\r\n     from prayer, and therefore is contrary to that attention which\r\n     presents our prayers in a right line to God. For so have I seen a\r\n     lark rising from his bed of grass, soaring upwards and singing as\r\n     he rises and hopes to get to Heaven and climb above the clouds;\r\n     but the poor bird was beaten back with the loud sighings of an\r\n     eastern wind and his motion made irregular and inconstant,\r\n     descending more at every breath of the tempest than it could\r\n     recover by the vibration and frequent weighing of his wings; till\r\n     the little creature was forced to sit down and pant and stay till\r\n     the storm was over; and then it made a prosperous flight and did\r\n     rise and sing as if it had learned music and motion from an angel\r\n     as he passed sometimes through the air about his ministries here\r\n     below. So is the prayer of a good man: when his affairs have\r\n     required business, and his business was matter of discipline, and\r\n     his discipline was to pass upon a sinning person, or had a design\r\n     of charity, his duty met with infirmities of a man and anger was\r\n     its instrument, and the instrument became stronger than the prime\r\n     agent and raised a tempest and overruled the man; and then his\r\n     prayer was broken and his thoughts troubled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"For so an impure vapour--begotten of the slime of the earth by\r\n     the fevers and adulterous heats of an intemperate summer sun,\r\n     striving by the ladder of a mountain to climb to heaven and\r\n     rolling into various figures by an uneasy, unfixed revolution,\r\n     and stopped at the middle region of the air, being thrown from\r\n     his pride and attempt of passing towards the seat of the\r\n     stars--turns into an unwholesome flame and, like the breath of\r\n     hell, is confined into a prison of darkness and a cloud, till it\r\n     breaks into diseases, plagues and mildews, stinks and blastings.\r\n     So is the prayer of an unchaste person. It strives to climb the\r\n     battlements of heaven, but because it is a flame of sulphur salt\r\n     and bitumen, and was kindled in the dishonourable regions below,\r\n     derived from Hell and contrary to God, it cannot pass forth to\r\n     the element of love; but ends in barrenness and murmurs,\r\n     fantastic expectations and trifling imaginative confidences; and\r\n     they at last end in sorrows and despair.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, like all very florid writers, Taylor is liable to eclipses of\r\ntaste; yet both the wording of his flights and the occasion of them (they\r\nare to be found _passim_ in the _Sermons_) are almost wholly admirable. It\r\nis always a great and universal idea--never a mere conceit--that fires him.\r\nThe shortness and dangers of life, the weakness of children, the fragility\r\nof women's beauty and men's strength, the change of the seasons, the\r\nvicissitudes of empires, the impossibility of satisfying desire, the\r\ndisgust which follows satiety--these are, if any one chooses, commonplace\r\nenough; yet it is the observation of all who have carefully studied\r\nliterature, and the experience of all who have observed their own thoughts,\r\nthat it is always in relation to these commonplaces that the most beautiful\r\nexpressions and the noblest sentiments arise. The uncommon thought is too\r\nlikely if not too certain to be an uncommon conceit, and if not worthless,\r\nyet of inferior worth. Among prose writers Taylor is unequalled for his\r\ntouches of this universal material, for the genius with which he makes the\r\ncommon uncommon. For instance, he has the supreme faculty of always making\r\nthe verbal and the intellectual presentation of the thought alike\r\nbeautiful, of appealing to the ear and the mind at the same time, of never\r\ndepriving the apple of gold of its picture of silver. Yet for all this the\r\ncharge of over-elaboration which may justly be brought against Browne very\r\nrarely hits Taylor. He seldom or never has the appearance which ornate\r\nwriters of all times, and of his own more especially, so often have, of\r\ngoing back on a thought or a phrase to try to better it--of being\r\nstimulated by actual or fancied applause to cap the climax. His most\r\nbeautiful passages come quite suddenly and naturally as the subject\r\nrequires and as the thought strikes light in his mind. Nor are they ever,\r\nas Milton's so often are, marred by a descent as rapid as their rise. He is\r\nnever below a certain decent level; he may return to earth from heaven, but\r\nhe goes no lower, and reaches even his lower level by a quiet and equable\r\nsinking. As has been fully allowed, he has grave defects, the defects of\r\nhis time. But from some of these he was conspicuously free, and on the\r\nwhole no one in English prose (unless it be his successor here) has so much\r\ncommand of the enchanter's wand as Jeremy Taylor.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Browne was born in the heart of London in 1605, his father (of\r\nwhom little is known except one or two anecdotes corresponding with the\r\ncharacter of the son) having been a merchant of some property, and claiming\r\ndescent from a good family in Cheshire. This father died when he was quite\r\nyoung, and Browne is said to have been cheated by his guardians; but he was\r\nevidently at all times of his life in easy circumstances, and seems to have\r\nhad no complaint to make of his stepfather, Sir Thomas Dutton. This\r\nstepfather may at least possibly have been the hero of the duel with Sir\r\nHatton Cheeke, which Mr. Carlyle has made famous. With him Browne visited\r\nIreland, having previously been brought up at Winchester and at Broadgates\r\nHall, which became, during his own residence, Pembroke College, at Oxford.\r\nLater he made the usual grand tour. Then he took medical degrees; practised\r\nit is said, though on no very precise evidence, both in Oxfordshire and\r\nYorkshire; settled, why is not known, at Norwich; married in 1641 Dorothy\r\nMileham, a lady of good family in his adopted county; was a steady Royalist\r\nthrough the troubles; acquired a great name for medical and scientific\r\nknowledge, though he was not a Fellow of the Royal Society; was knighted by\r\nCharles II. in 1662, and died in 1682. His first literary appearance had\r\nbeen made forty years earlier in a way very common in French literary\r\nhistory, but so uncommon in English as to have drawn from Johnson a rather\r\nunwontedly illiberal sneer. At a time unknown, but by his own account\r\nbefore his thirtieth year (therefore before 1635), Browne had written the\r\n_Religio Medici_. It was, according to the habit of the time, copied and\r\nhanded about in MS. (there exist now five MS. copies showing remarkable\r\ndifferences with each other and the printed copies), and in 1642 it got\r\ninto print. A copy was sent by Lord Dorset to the famous Sir Kenelm Digby,\r\nthen under confinement for his opinions, and the husband of Venetia wrote\r\ncertain not very forcible and not wholly complimentary remarks which, as\r\nBrowne was informed, were at once put to press. A correspondence ensued,\r\nand Browne published an authorised copy, in which perhaps a little\r\n\"economy\" might be noticed. The book made an extraordinary impression, and\r\nwas widely translated and commented on in foreign languages, though its\r\nvogue was purely due to its intrinsic merits, and not at all to the\r\ncircumstances which enabled Milton (rather arrogantly and not with absolute\r\ntruth) to boast that \"Europe rang from side to side\" with his defence of\r\nthe execution of Charles I. Four years later, in 1646, Browne published his\r\nlargest and in every sense most popular book, the _Pseudodoxia Epidemica_\r\nor _Enquiry into Vulgar Errors_. Twelve more years passed before the\r\ngreatest, from a literary point of view, of his works, the _Hydriotaphia_\r\nor _Urn-Burial_,--a magnificent descant on the vanity of human life, based\r\non the discovery of certain cinerary urns in Norfolk,--appeared, in company\r\nwith the quaint _Garden of Cyrus_, a half-learned, half-fanciful discussion\r\nof the mysteries of the quincunx and the number five. Nor did he publish\r\nanything more himself; but two collections of posthumous works were issued\r\nafter his death, the most important item of which is the _Christian\r\nMorals_, and the total has been swelled since by extracts from his MSS.,\r\nwhich at the death of his grandson and namesake in 1710 were sold by\r\nauction. Most fortunately they were nearly all bought by Sir Hans Sloane,\r\nand are to this day in the British Museum. Browne's good luck in this\r\nrespect was completed by the devotion of his editor, Simon Wilkin, a\r\nNorwich bookseller of gentle blood and good education, who produced (1835)\r\nafter twelve years' labour of love what Southey has justly called the best\r\nedited book in the English language. Not to mention other editions, the\r\n_Religio Medici_, which exhibits, owing to its history, an unusual\r\nvariation of text, has been, together with the _Christian Morals_,\r\nseparately edited with great minuteness by Dr. Greenhill. Nor is it\r\nunimportant to notice that Johnson, during his period of literary\r\nhack-work, also edited Sir Thomas Browne, and wrote what Wilkin's good\r\ntaste has permitted to be still the standard text of his Life.\r\n\r\nThe work of this country doctor is, for personal savour, for strangeness,\r\nand for delight, one of the most notable things in English literature. It\r\nis not of extraordinary voluminousness, for though swollen in Wilkin's\r\nedition by abundant editorial matter, it fills but three of the well-known\r\nvolumes of Bohn's series, and, printed by itself, it might not much exceed\r\ntwo ordinary library octavos; but in character and interest it yields to\r\nthe work of no other English prose writer. It may be divided, from our\r\npoint of view, into two unequal parts, the smaller of which is in truth of\r\nthe greater interest. The _Vulgar Errors_, those of the smaller tracts\r\nwhich deal with subjects of natural history (as most of them do), many of\r\nthe commonplace book entries, the greater part of the _Garden of Cyrus_,\r\nand most of the _Letters_, are mainly distinguished by an interest of\r\nmatter constantly increased, it is true, by the display of the author's\r\nracy personality, and diversified here and there by passages also\r\ndisplaying his style to the full, but in general character not differing\r\nfrom the works of other curious writers in the delightful period which\r\npassed between the childish credulity of mediaeval and classical physics and\r\nthe arid analysis of the modern \"scientist.\" Sir Thomas Browne was of a\r\ncertain natural scepticism of temperament (a scepticism which, as displayed\r\nin relation to other matters in the _Religio Medici_, very unjustly\r\nbrought upon him the reproach of religious unorthodoxy); he was a trained\r\nand indefatigable observer of facts, and he was by no means prepared to\r\nreceive authority as final in any extra-religious matters. But he had a\r\nthoroughly literary, not to say poetical idiosyncrasy; he was both by\r\nnature and education disposed to seek for something more than that physical\r\nexplanation which, as the greatest of all anti-supernatural philosophers\r\nhas observed, merely pushes ignorance a little farther back; and he was\r\npossessed of an extraordinary fertility of imagination which made comment,\r\nanalogy, and amplification both easy and delightful to him. He was,\r\ntherefore, much more disposed--except in the face of absolutely conclusive\r\nevidence--to rationalise than to deny a vulgar error, to bring explanations\r\nand saving clauses to its aid, than to cut it adrift utterly. In this part\r\nof his work his distinguishing graces and peculiarities of style appear but\r\nsparingly and not eminently. In the other division, consisting of the\r\n_Religio Medici_, the _Urn-Burial_, the _Christian Morals_, and the _Letter\r\nto a Friend_, his strictly literary peculiarities, as being less hampered\r\nby the exposition of matter, have freer scope; and it must be recollected\r\nthat these literary peculiarities, independently of their own interest,\r\nhave been a main influence in determining the style of two of the most\r\nremarkable writers of English prose in the two centuries immediately\r\nsucceeding Browne. It has been said that Johnson edited him somewhat early;\r\nand all the best authorities are in accord that the Johnsonian Latinisms,\r\ndifferently managed as they are, are in all probability due more to the\r\nfollowing--if only to the unconscious following--of Browne than to anything\r\nelse. The second instance is more indubitable still and more happy. It\r\ndetracts nothing from the unique charm of \"Elia,\" and it will be most\r\nclearly recognised by those who know \"Elia\" best, that Lamb constantly\r\nborrows from Browne, that the mould and shape of his most characteristic\r\nphrases is frequently suggested directly by Sir Thomas, and that though\r\nthere seldom can have been a follower who put more of his own in his\r\nfollowing, it may be pronounced with confidence, \"no Browne, no Lamb,\" at\r\nleast in the forms in which we know the author of \"Elia\" best, and in which\r\nall those who know him best, though they may love him always, love him\r\nmost. Yet Browne is not a very easy author to \"sample.\" A few splendid\r\nsustained passages, like the famous one in the _Urn-Burial_, are\r\nuniversally known, but he is best in flashes. The following, from the\r\n_Christian Morals_, is characteristic enough:--\r\n\r\n     \"Punish not thyself with pleasure; glut not thy sense with\r\n     palative delights; nor revenge the contempt of temperance by the\r\n     penalty of satiety. Were there an age of delight or any pleasure\r\n     durable, who would not honour Volupia? but the race of delight is\r\n     short, and pleasures have mutable faces. The pleasures of one age\r\n     are not pleasures in another, and their lives fall short of our\r\n     own. Even in our sensual days the strength of delight is in its\r\n     seldomness or rarity, and sting in its satiety; mediocrity is its\r\n     life, and immoderacy its confusion. The luxurious emperors of old\r\n     inconsiderately satiated themselves with the dainties of sea and\r\n     land till, wearied through all varieties, their refections became\r\n     a study with them, and they were fain to feed by invention:\r\n     novices in true epicurism! which by mediocrity, paucity, quick\r\n     and healthful appetite, makes delights smartly acceptable;\r\n     whereby Epicurus himself found Jupiter's brain in a piece of\r\n     Cytheridian cheese, and the tongues of nightingales in a dish of\r\n     onions. Hereby healthful and temperate poverty hath the start of\r\n     nauseating luxury; unto whose clear and naked appetite every meal\r\n     is a feast, and in one single dish the first course of Metellus;\r\n     who are cheaply hungry, and never lose their hunger, or advantage\r\n     of a craving appetite, because obvious food contents it; while\r\n     Nero, half famish'd, could not feed upon a piece of bread, and,\r\n     lingering after his snowed water, hardly got down an ordinary cup\r\n     of _Calda_. By such circumscriptions of pleasure the contemned\r\n     philosophers reserved unto themselves the secret of delight,\r\n     which the Helluos of those days lost in their exorbitances. In\r\n     vain we study delight; it is at the command of every sober mind,\r\n     and in every sense born with us; but Nature, who teacheth us the\r\n     rule of pleasure, instructeth also in the bounds thereof and\r\n     where its line expireth. And therefore temperate minds, not\r\n     pressing their pleasures until the sting appeareth, enjoy their\r\n     contentations contentedly and without regret, and so escape the\r\n     folly of excess, to be pleased unto displacency.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"Bring candid eyes unto the perusal of men's works, and let not\r\n     Zoilism or detraction blast well-intended labours. He that\r\n     endureth no faults in men's writings must only read his own,\r\n     wherein for the most part all appeareth white. Quotation\r\n     mistakes, inadvertency, expedition and human lapses, may make not\r\n     only moles but warts in learned authors, who notwithstanding,\r\n     being judged by the capital matter, admit not of disparagement.\r\n     I should unwillingly affirm that Cicero was but slightly versed\r\n     in Homer, because in his work _De Gloria_ he ascribed those\r\n     verses unto Ajax which were delivered by Hector. What if Plautus,\r\n     in the account of Hercules, mistaketh nativity for conception?\r\n     Who would have mean thoughts of Apollinaris Sidonius, who seems\r\n     to mistake the river Tigris for Euphrates; and, though a good\r\n     historian and learned Bishop of Auvergne, had the misfortune to\r\n     be out in the story of David, making mention of him when the ark\r\n     was sent back by the Philistines upon a cart, which was before\r\n     his time? Though I have no great opinion of Machiavel's learning,\r\n     yet I shall not presently say that he was but a novice in Roman\r\n     History, because he was mistaken in placing Commodus after the\r\n     Emperor Severus. Capital truths are to be narrowly eyed,\r\n     collateral lapses and circumstantial deliveries not to be too\r\n     strictly sifted. And if the substantial subject be well forged\r\n     out, we need not examine the sparks which irregularly fly from\r\n     it.\"\r\n\r\nColeridge, as we have seen, charges Browne with corrupting the style of the\r\ngreat age. The charge is not just in regard to either of the two great\r\nfaults which are urged against the style, strictly speaking; while it is\r\nhardly just in reference to a minor charge which is brought against what is\r\nnot quite style, namely, the selection and treatment of the thought. The\r\ntwo charges first referred to are Latinising of vocabulary and disorderly\r\nsyntax of sentence. In regard to the first, Browne Latinises somewhat more\r\nthan Jeremy Taylor, hardly at all more than Milton, though he does not,\r\nlike Milton, contrast and relieve his Latinisms by indulgence in vernacular\r\nterms of the most idiomatic kind; and he is conspicuously free from the\r\ngreat fault both of Milton and of Taylor--the clumsy conglomeration of\r\nclauses which turns a sentence into a paragraph, and makes a badly ordered\r\nparagraph of it after all. Browne's sentences, especially those of the\r\nbooks regularly prepared for the press by him, are by no means long and are\r\nusually very perspicuous, being separable in some cases into shorter\r\nsentences by a mere mechanical repunctuation which, if tried on Taylor or\r\nMilton, would make nonsense. To say that they are sometimes longer than\r\nthey should be, and often awkwardly co-ordinated, is merely to say that he\r\nwrote when he wrote; but he by no means sins beyond his fellows. In regard\r\nto Latinisms his case is not so good. He constantly uses such words as\r\n\"clarity\" for \"clearness,\" \"ferity\" for \"fierceness\" or \"wildness,\" when\r\nnothing is gained by the exotic form. Dr. Greenhill's useful glossary to\r\nthe _Religio_ and the _Morals_ exhibits in tabular form not merely such\r\nterms as \"abbreviatures,\" \"aequilibriously,\" \"bivious,\" \"convincible,\"\r\n\"exantlation,\" and hundreds of others with which there is no need to fill\r\nthe page, but also a number only less considerable of those far more\r\nobjectionable usages which take a word generally understood in one sense\r\n(as, for instance, \"equable,\" \"gratitudes,\" and many others), and by\r\ntwisting or translation of its classical equivalents and etymons give it\r\nsome quite new sense in English. It is true that in some cases the usual\r\nsense was not then firmly established, but Browne can hardly be acquitted\r\nof wilfully preferring the obscurer.\r\n\r\nYet this hybrid and bizarre vocabulary is so admirably married to the\r\nsubstance of the writing that no one of taste can find fault with it. For\r\nBrowne (to come to the third point mentioned above), though he never\r\ndescends or diverges--whichever word may be preferred--to the extravagant\r\nand occasionally puerile conceits which even such writers as Fuller and\r\nGlanville cannot resist, has a quaintness at least equal to theirs. In no\r\ngreat writer is the unforeseen so constantly happening. Everyone who has\r\nwritten on him has quoted the famous termination of the _Garden of Cyrus_,\r\nwhere he determines that it is time to go to bed, because \"to keep our eyes\r\nopen longer were but to act our antipodes. The huntsmen are up in America,\r\nand they are already past their first sleep in Persia.\" A fancy so\r\nwhimsical as this, and yet so admirable in its whimsies, requires a style\r\nin accordance; and the very sentence quoted, though one of the plainest of\r\nBrowne's, and showing clearly that he does not always abuse Latinising,\r\nwould hardly be what it is without the word \"antipodes.\" So again in the\r\n_Christian Morals_, \"Be not stoically mistaken in the quality of sins, nor\r\ncommutatively iniquitous in the valuation of transgressions.\" No expression\r\nso terse and yet so striking could dispense with the classicism and the\r\ncatachresis of \"stoically.\" And so it is everywhere with Browne. His\r\nmanner is exactly proportioned to his matter; his exotic and unfamiliar\r\nvocabulary to the strangeness and novelty of his thoughts. He can never be\r\nreally popular; but for the meditative reading of instructed persons he is\r\nperhaps the most delightful of English prosemen.\r\n\r\nThere are probably few English writers in regard to whom the judgment of\r\ncritics, usually ranked as competent, has varied more than in regard to\r\nEdward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon. To some extent this is easily intelligible\r\nto any one who, with some equipment, reads any considerable quantity of his\r\nwork; but it would be idle to pretend that the great stumbling-block of all\r\ncriticism--the attention to matter rather than to form--has had nothing to\r\ndo with it. Clarendon, at first not a very zealous Royalist, was the only\r\nman of decided literary genius who, with contemporary knowledge, wrote the\r\nhistory of the great debate between king and commonwealth. The effect of\r\nhis history in deciding the question on the Royalist side was felt in\r\nEngland for more than a century; and since popular judgment has somewhat\r\nveered round to the other side, its chief exponents have found it necessary\r\neither to say as little as possible about Clarendon or to depreciate him.\r\nHis interesting political history cannot be detailed here. Of a good\r\nCheshire family, but not originally wealthy, he was educated as a lawyer,\r\nwas early adopted into the \"tribe of Ben,\" and was among the first to take\r\nadvantage of the opening which the disputes between king and parliament\r\ngave to men of his birth, education, and gifts. At first he was a moderate\r\nopponent of the king's attempts to dispense with parliament; but the\r\ngrowing evidence that the House of Commons was seeking to increase its own\r\nconstitutional power at the expense of the prerogative, and especially the\r\nanti-Church tendencies of the parliamentary leaders, converted him at first\r\ninto a moderate and then into a strong Royalist. One of the chief of the\r\nking's constitutional advisers, he was after the Restoration the most\r\ndistinguished by far of those Cavaliers who had parliamentary and\r\nconstitutional experience; and with the title and office of Chancellor, he\r\nexercised a practical premiership during the first seven years of the\r\nRestoration. But ill-fortune, and it must be confessed some unwisdom,\r\nmarked his government. He has been often and truly said to have been a\r\nstatesman of Elizabeth, born three-quarters of a century too late. He was\r\nthought by the public to be arbitrary, a courtier, and even to some extent\r\ncorrupt. He seemed to the king to be a tiresome formalist and censor, who\r\nwas only scrupulous in resisting the royal will. So he was impeached; and,\r\nbeing compelled to quit the kingdom, spent the last seven years of his life\r\nin France. His great works, begun during his first exile and completed\r\nduring his second, are the _History of the Rebellion_ and his own _Life_,\r\nthe former being by much the more important though the latter (divided into\r\na \"Life\" and a \"Continuation,\" the last of which starts from the\r\nRestoration) contains much interesting and important biographical and\r\nhistorical matter. The text of these works was conveyed by his heirs to the\r\nUniversity of Oxford, and long remained an exception to the general rule of\r\nthe terminableness of copyright.\r\n\r\nClarendon is a very striking example of the hackneyed remark, that in some\r\ncases at any rate men's merits are their own and their faults those of\r\ntheir time. His literary merits are, looked at by themselves, of nearly the\r\nhighest kind. He is certainly the best English writer (and may challenge\r\nany foreigner without much fear of the result) in the great, difficult, and\r\nnow almost lost art of character-(or, as it was called in his time,\r\nportrait-) drawing--that is to say, sketching in words the physical, moral,\r\nand mental, but especially the moral and mental, peculiarities of a given\r\nperson. Not a few of these characters of his are among the well-known\r\n\"beauties\" justified in selection by the endorsement of half a dozen\r\ngenerations. They are all full of life; and even where it may be thought\r\nthat prejudice has had something to do with the picture, still the subject\r\nlives, and is not a mere bundle of contradictory or even of superficially\r\ncompatible characteristics. Secondly, Clarendon is at his best an\r\nincomparable narrator. Many of his battles, though related with apparent\r\ncoolness, and without the slightest attempt to be picturesque, may rank as\r\nworks of art with his portraits, just as the portraits and battle pieces of\r\na great painter may rank together. The sober vivid touches, the little bits\r\nof what the French call _reportage_ or mere reproduction of the actual\r\nwords and deeds of the personages, the elaborate and carefully-concealed\r\nart of the composition, all deserve the highest praise. Here, for instance,\r\nis a fair average passage, showing Clarendon's masterly skill in summary\r\nnarration and his equally masterly, though, as some hold, rather\r\nunscrupulous faculty of insinuating depreciation:--\r\n\r\n     \"Since there will be often occasion to mention this gentleman,\r\n     Sir Richard Granvil, in the ensuing discourse, and because many\r\n     men believed that he was hardly dealt with in the next year,\r\n     where all the proceedings will be set down at large, it will not\r\n     be unfit in this place to say somewhat of him, and of the manner\r\n     and merit of his entering into the king's service some months\r\n     before the time we are now upon. He was of a very ancient and\r\n     worthy family in Cornwall which had in several ages produced men\r\n     of great courage, and very signal in their fidelity to and\r\n     service of the crown; and was himself younger brother (though in\r\n     his nature or humour not of kin to him) to the brave Sir Basil\r\n     Granvil who so courageously lost his life at the battle of\r\n     Lansdowne. Being a younger brother and a very young man, he went\r\n     into the Low Countries to learn the profession of a soldier; to\r\n     which he had devoted himself under the greatest general of that\r\n     age, Prince Maurice, and in the regiment of my Lord Vere, who was\r\n     general of all the English. In that service he was looked upon as\r\n     a man of courage and a diligent officer, in the quality of a\r\n     captain, to which he attained after four years' service. About\r\n     this time, in the end of the reign of King James, the war broke\r\n     out between England and Spain; and in the expedition to Cadiz\r\n     this gentleman served as a major to a regiment of foot, and\r\n     continued in the same command in the war that shortly after\r\n     followed against France; and at the Isle of Rhe insinuated\r\n     himself into the very good graces of the Duke of Buckingham, who\r\n     was the general in that mission; and after the unfortunate\r\n     retreat from thence was made colonel of a regiment with general\r\n     approbation and as an officer that well deserved it.\r\n\r\n     \"His credit increased every day with the duke: who, out of the\r\n     generosity of his nature, as a most generous person he was,\r\n     resolved to raise his fortune; towards the beginning of which, by\r\n     his countenance and solicitation, he prevailed with a rich widow\r\n     to marry him, who had been a lady of extraordinary beauty, which\r\n     she had not yet outlived; and though she had no great dower by\r\n     her husband, a younger brother of the Earl of Suffolk, yet she\r\n     inherited a fair fortune of her own near Plymouth, and was\r\n     besides very rich in a personal estate, and was looked upon as\r\n     the richest marriage of the West. This lady, by the duke's\r\n     credit, Sir Richard Granvil (for he was now made a knight and\r\n     baronet) obtained, and was thereby possessed of a plentiful\r\n     estate upon the borders of his own country, and where his own\r\n     family had great credit and authority. The war being now at an\r\n     end and he deprived of his great patron, [he] had nothing to\r\n     depend upon but the fortune of his wife: which, though ample\r\n     enough to have supported the expense a person of his quality\r\n     ought to have made, was not large enough to satisfy his vanity\r\n     and ambition, nor so great as he upon common reports had\r\n     possessed himself by her. By being not enough pleased with her\r\n     fortune he grew displeased with his wife, who, being a woman of a\r\n     haughty and imperious nature and of a wit superior to his,\r\n     quickly resented the disrespect she received from him and in no\r\n     respect studied to make herself easy to him. After some years\r\n     spent together in those domestic unsociable contestations, in\r\n     which he possessed himself of all her estate as the sole master\r\n     of it, without allowing her out of her own any competency for\r\n     herself, and indulged to himself all those licenses in her own\r\n     house which to women are most grievous, she found means to\r\n     withdraw herself from him; and was with all kindness received\r\n     into that family in which she had before been married and was\r\n     always very much respected.\"\r\n\r\nTo superficial observers, or observers who have convinced themselves that\r\nhigh lights and bright colourings are of the essence of the art of the\r\nprose writer, Clarendon may seem tame and jejune. He is in reality just the\r\ncontrary. His wood is tough enough and close-grained enough, but there is\r\nplenty of sap coursing through it. In yet a third respect, which is less\r\nclosely connected with the purely formal aspect of style, Clarendon stands,\r\nif not pre-eminent, very high among historians. This is his union of acute\r\npenetration and vigorous grasp in the treatment of complicated events. It\r\nhas been hinted that he seems to have somewhat lost grasp, if not\r\npenetration, after the Restoration. But at the time of his earlier\r\nparticipation in public affairs, and of his composition of the greater part\r\nof his historical writings, he was in the very vigour and prime of life;\r\nand though it may be that he was \"a Janus of one face,\" and looked rather\r\nbackward than forward, even then he was profoundly acquainted with the\r\nfacts of English history, with the character of his countrymen, and with\r\nthe relations of events as they happened. It may even be contended by those\r\nwho care for might-have-beens, that but for the headlong revolt against\r\nPuritanism, which inspired the majority of the nation with a kind of\r\ncarnival madness for many years after 1660, and the strange deficiency of\r\nstatesmen of even moderately respectable character on both sides (except\r\nClarendon himself, and the fairly upright though time-serving Temple, there\r\nis hardly a respectable man to be found on any side of politics for forty\r\nyears), Clarendon's post-Restoration policy itself would not have been the\r\nfailure that it was. But it is certain that on the events of his own middle\r\nage he looked with the keenest discernment, and with the widest\r\ncomprehension.\r\n\r\nAgainst these great merits must be set a treble portion of the great defect\r\nwhich, as we have said, vitiates all the English prose work of his time,\r\nthe unconscious or wilful ignoring of the very fundamental principles of\r\nsentence-and paragraph-architecture. His mere syntax, in the most\r\nrestricted sense of that word, is not very bad; he seldom indulges out of\r\nmere _incuria_ in false concords or blunders over a relative. But he is the\r\nmost offending soul alive at any time in English literature in one grave\r\npoint. No one has put together, or, to adopt a more expressive phrase,\r\nheaped together such enormous paragraphs; no one has linked clause on\r\nclause, parenthesis on parenthesis, epexegesis on exegesis, in such a\r\nbewildering concatenation of inextricable entanglement. Sometimes, of\r\ncourse, the difficulty is more apparent than real, and by simply\r\nsubstituting full stops and capitals for his colons and conjunctions, one\r\nmay, to some extent, simplify the chaos. But it is seldom that this is\r\nreally effective: it never produces really well balanced sentences and\r\nreally well constructed paragraphs; and there are constant instances in\r\nwhich it is not applicable at all. It is not that the jostling and confused\r\nrelatives are as a rule grammatically wrong, like the common blunder of\r\nputting an \"and which\" where there is no previous \"which\" expressed or\r\nimplied. They, simply, put as they are, bewilder and muddle the reader\r\nbecause the writer has not taken the trouble to break up his sentence into\r\ntwo or three. This is, of course, a very gross abuse, and except when the\r\ntalents above noticed either fuse his style into something better, or by\r\nthe interest they excite divert the attention of the reader, it constantly\r\nmakes Clarendon anything but agreeable reading, and produces an impression\r\nof dryness and prolixity with which he is not quite justly chargeable. The\r\nplain truth is that, as has been said often before, and may have to be said\r\nmore than once again, the sense of proportion and order in prose\r\ncomposition was not born. The famous example--the awful example--of Oliver\r\nCromwell's speeches shows the worst-known instance of this; but the best\r\nwriters of Cromwell's own generation--far better educated than he,\r\nprofessed men of letters after a fashion, and without the excuse of\r\nimpromptu, or of the scurry of unnoted, speech--sometimes came not far\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nAgainst one great writer of the time, however, no such charge can be justly\r\nbrought. Although much attention has recently been given to the\r\nphilosophical opinions of Hobbes, since the unjust prejudice against his\r\nreligious and political ideas wore away, and since the complete edition of\r\nhis writings published at last in 1843 by Sir William Molesworth made him\r\naccessible, the extraordinary merits of his style have on the whole had\r\nrather less than justice done to them. He was in many ways a very singular\r\nperson. Born at Malmesbury in the year of the Armada, he was educated at\r\nOxford, and early in the seventeenth century was appointed tutor to the\r\neldest son of Lord Hardwick, afterwards Earl of Devonshire. For full\r\nseventy years he was on and off in the service of the Cavendish family; but\r\nsometimes acted as tutor to others, and both in that capacity and for other\r\nreasons lived long abroad. In his earlier manhood he was much in the\r\nsociety of Bacon, Jonson, and the literary folk of the English capital; and\r\nlater he was equally familiar with the society (rather scientific than\r\nliterary) of Paris. In 1647 he was appointed mathematical tutor to the\r\nPrince of Wales; but his mathematics were not his most fortunate\r\nacquirement, and they involved him in long and acrimonious disputes with\r\nWallis and others--disputes, it may be said, where Hobbes was quite wrong.\r\nThe publication of his philosophical treatises, and especially of the\r\n_Leviathan_, brought him into very bad odour, not merely on political\r\ngrounds (which, so long as the Commonwealth lasted, would not have been\r\nsurprising), but for religious reasons; and during the last years of his\r\nlife, and for long afterwards, \"Hobbist\" was, certainly with very little\r\nwarrant from his writings, used as a kind of polite equivalent for atheist.\r\nHe was pensioned after the Restoration, and the protection of the king and\r\nthe Earl of Devonshire kept him scatheless, if ever there was any real\r\ndanger. Hobbes, however, was a timid and very much self-centred person,\r\nalways fancying that plots were being laid against him. He died at the\r\ngreat age of ninety-two.\r\n\r\nThis long life was wholly taken up with study, but did not produce a very\r\nlarge amount of original composition. It is true that his collected works\r\nfill sixteen volumes; but they are loosely printed, and much space is\r\noccupied with diagrams, indices, and such like things, while a very large\r\nproportion of the matter appears twice over, in Latin and in English. In\r\nthe latter case Hobbes usually wrote first in Latin, and was not always his\r\nown translator; but it would appear that he generally revised the work,\r\nthough he neither succeeded in obliterating nor perhaps attempted to\r\nobliterate the marks of the original vehicle. His earliest publication was\r\na singularly vigorous, if not always scholastically exact, translation of\r\nThucydides into English, which appeared in 1629. Thirteen years later he\r\npublished in Paris the _De Cive_, which was shortly followed by the\r\ntreatise on _Human Nature_ and the _De Corpore Politico_. The latter of\r\nthese was to a great extent worked up in the famous _Leviathan_, or the\r\n_Matter, Power, and Form of a Commonwealth_, which appeared in 1651. The\r\nimportant _De Corpore_, which corresponds to the _Leviathan_ on the\r\nphilosophical side, appeared in Latin in 1655, in English next year.\r\nBesides minor works, Hobbes employed his old age on a translation of Homer\r\ninto verse, and on a sketch of the Civil Wars called _Behemoth_.\r\n\r\nHis verse is a mere curiosity, though a considerable curiosity. The chief\r\nof it (the translation of Homer written in the quatrain, which his friend\r\nDavenant's _Gondibert_ had made popular) is completely lacking in poetical\r\nquality, of which, perhaps, no man ever had less than Hobbes; and it is\r\nwritten on a bad model. But it has so much of the nervous bull-dog strength\r\nwhich, in literature if not in life, was Hobbes's main characteristic, that\r\nit is sometimes both a truer and a better representative of the original\r\nthan some very mellifluous and elegant renderings. It is as a prose writer,\r\nhowever, that Hobbes made, and that he will keep, his fame. With his\r\nprinciples in the various branches of philosophy we have little or nothing\r\nto do. In choosing them he manifested, no doubt, something of the same\r\ndefiance of authority, and the same self-willed preference for his own not\r\ntoo well-educated opinion, which brought him to grief in his encounter with\r\nWallis. But when he had once left his starting points, his sureness of\r\nreasoning, his extreme perspicacity, and the unerring clearness and\r\ncertainty with which he kept before him, and expressed exactly what he\r\nmeant, made him at once one of the greatest thinkers and one of the\r\ngreatest writers of England. Hobbes never \"pays himself with words,\" never\r\nevades a difficulty by becoming obscure, never meanders on in the graceful\r\nallusive fashion of many philosophers,--a fashion for which the prevalent\r\nfaults of style were singularly convenient in his time. He has no ornament,\r\nhe does not seem to aim at anything more than the simplest and most\r\nstraightforward presentation of his views. But this very aim, assisted by\r\nhis practice in writing the terse and clear, if not very elegant, Latin\r\nwhich was the universal language of the literary Europe of his time,\r\nsuffices to preserve him from most of the current sins. Moreover, it is\r\nfair to remember that, though the last to die, he was the first to be born\r\nof the authors mentioned in this chapter, and that he may be supposed, late\r\nas he wrote, to have formed his style before the period of Jacobean and\r\nCaroline luxuriance.\r\n\r\nAlmost any one of Hobbes's books would suffice to illustrate his style; but\r\nthe short and interesting treatise on _Human Nature_, perhaps, shows it at\r\nits best. The author's exceptional clearness may be assisted by his lavish\r\nuse of italics; but it is not necessary to read far in order to see that it\r\nis in reality quite independent of any clumsy mechanical device. The\r\ncrabbed but sharply outlined style, the terse phrasing, the independence of\r\nall after-thoughts and tackings-on, manifest themselves at once to any\r\ncareful observer. Here for instance is a passage, perhaps his finest, on\r\nLove, followed by a political extract from another work:--\r\n\r\n     \"Of love, by which is to be understood the joy man taketh in the\r\n     fruition of any present good, hath been spoken already in the\r\n     first section, chapter seven, under which is contained the love\r\n     men bear to one another or pleasure they take in one another's\r\n     company: and by which nature men are said to be sociable. But\r\n     there is another kind of love which the Greeks call Eros, and is\r\n     that which we mean when we say that a man is in love: forasmuch\r\n     as this passion cannot be without diversity of sex, it cannot be\r\n     denied but that it participateth of that indefinite love\r\n     mentioned in the former section. But there is a great difference\r\n     betwixt the desire of a man indefinite and the same desire\r\n     limited _ad hunc_: and this is that love which is the great theme\r\n     of poets: but, notwithstanding their praises, it must be defined\r\n     by the word need: for it is a conception a man hath of his need\r\n     of that one person desired. The cause of this passion is not\r\n     always nor for the most part beauty, or other quality in the\r\n     beloved, unless there be withal hope in the person that loveth:\r\n     which may be gathered from this, that in great difference of\r\n     persons the greater have often fallen in love with the meaner,\r\n     but not contrary. And from hence it is that for the most part\r\n     they have much better fortune in love whose hopes are built on\r\n     something in their person than those that trust to their\r\n     expressions and service; and they that care less than they that\r\n     care more: which not perceiving, many men cast away their\r\n     services as one arrow after another, till, in the end, together\r\n     with their hopes, they lose their wits.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"There are some who therefore imagine monarchy to be more\r\n     grievous than democracy, because there is less liberty in that\r\n     than in this. If by liberty they mean an exemption from that\r\n     subjection which is due to the laws, that is, the commands of the\r\n     people; neither in democracy nor in any other state of\r\n     government whatsoever is there any such kind of liberty. If they\r\n     suppose liberty to consist in this, that there be few laws, few\r\n     prohibitions, and those too such that, except they were\r\n     forbidden, there could be no peace; then I deny that there is\r\n     more liberty in democracy than in monarchy; for the one as truly\r\n     consisteth with such a liberty as the other. For although the\r\n     word liberty may in large and ample letters be written over the\r\n     gates of any city whatsoever, yet it is not meant the subjects'\r\n     but the city's liberty; neither can that word with better right\r\n     be inscribed on a city which is governed by the people than that\r\n     which is ruled by a monarch. But when private men or subjects\r\n     demand liberty under the name of liberty, they ask not for\r\n     liberty but domination: which yet for want of understanding they\r\n     little consider. For if every man would grant the same liberty to\r\n     another which he desires for himself, as is commanded by the law\r\n     of nature, that same natural state would return again in which\r\n     all men may by right do all things; which if they knew they would\r\n     abhor, as being worse than all kinds of civil subjection\r\n     whatsoever. But if any man desire to have his single freedom, the\r\n     rest being bound, what does he else demand but to have the\r\n     dominion?\"\r\n\r\nIt may be observed that Hobbes's sentences are by no means very short as\r\nfar as actual length goes. He has some on a scale which in strictness is\r\nperhaps hardly justifiable. But what may generally be asserted of them is\r\nthat the author for the most part is true to that great rule, of logic and\r\nof style alike, which ordains that a single sentence shall be, as far as\r\npossible, the verbal presentation of a single thought, and not the\r\nagglomeration and sweeping together of a whole string and tissue of\r\nthoughts. It is noticeable, too, that Hobbes is very sparing of the\r\nadjective--the great resource and delight of flowery and discursive\r\nwriters. Sometimes, as in the famous comparison of human life to a race\r\n(where, by the way, a slight tendency to conceit manifests itself, and\r\nmakes him rather force some of his metaphors), his conciseness assumes a\r\ndistinctly epigrammatic form; and it is constantly visible also in his more\r\nconsecutive writings.\r\n\r\nIn the well-known passage on Laughter as \"a passion of sudden glory\" the\r\nwriter may be charged with allowing his fancy too free play; though I, for\r\nmy part, am inclined to consider the explanation the most satisfactory yet\r\ngiven of a difficult phenomenon. But the point is the distinctness with\r\nwhich Hobbes puts this novel and, at first sight, improbable idea, the apt\r\nturns and illustrations (standing at the same time far from the excess of\r\nillustration and analogy, by which many writers of his time would have spun\r\nit out into a chapter if not into a treatise), the succinct, forcible,\r\neconomical adjustment of the fewest words to the clearest exposition of\r\nthought. Perhaps these things strike the more as they are the more unlike\r\nthe work in juxtaposition with which one finds them; nor can it be\r\nmaintained that Hobbes's style is suitable for all purposes. Admirable for\r\nargument and exposition, it is apt to become bald in narration, and its\r\nabundance of clearness, when translated to less purely intellectual\r\nsubjects, may even expose it to the charge of being thin. Such a note as\r\nthat struck in the Love passage above given is rare, and sets one wondering\r\nwhether the dry-as-dust philosopher of Malmesbury, the man who seems to\r\nhave had hardly any human frailties except vanity and timidity, had himself\r\nfelt the bitterness of counting on expressions and services, the madness of\r\nthrowing away one effort after another to gain the favour of the beloved.\r\nBut it is very seldom that any such suggestion is provoked by remarks of\r\nHobbes's. His light is almost always dry; and in one sense, though not in\r\nanother, a little malignant. Yet nowhere is there to be found a style more\r\nabsolutely suited, not merely to the author's intentions but to his\r\nperformances--a form more exactly married to matter. Nor anywhere is there\r\nto be found a writer who is more independent of others. He may have owed\r\nsomething to his friend Jonson, in whose _Timber_ there are resemblances to\r\nHobbes; but he certainly owed nothing, and in all probability lent much, to\r\nthe Drydens, and Tillotsons, and Temples, who in the last twenty years of\r\nhis own life reformed English prose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nCAROLINE POETRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few periods of poetical development in English literary history\r\nwhich display, in a comparatively narrow compass, such well-marked and\r\npervading individuality as the period of Caroline poetry, beginning, it may\r\nbe, a little before the accession of Charles I., but terminating as a\r\nproducing period almost before the real accession of his son. The poets of\r\nthis period, in which but not of which Milton is, are numerous and\r\nremarkable, and at the head of them all stands Robert Herrick.\r\n\r\nVery little is really known about Herrick's history. That he was of a\r\nfamily which, distinguished above the common, but not exactly reaching\r\nnobility, had the credit of producing, besides himself, the indomitable\r\nWarden Heyrick of the Collegiate Church of Manchester in his own times, and\r\nthe mother of Swift in the times immediately succeeding his, is certain.\r\nThat he was born in London in 1591, that he went to Cambridge, that he had\r\na rather stingy guardian, that he associated to some extent with the tribe\r\nof Ben in the literary London of the second decade of the century, is also\r\ncertain. At last and rather late he was appointed to a living at Dean Prior\r\nin Devonshire, on the confines of the South Hams and Dartmoor. He did not\r\nlike it, being of that class of persons who cannot be happy out of a great\r\ntown. After the Civil War he was deprived, and his successor had not the\r\ndecency (the late Dr. Grosart, constant to his own party, made a very\r\nunsuccessful attempt to defend the delinquent) to pay him the shabby\r\npittance which the intruders were supposed to furnish to the rightful\r\nowners of benefices. At the Restoration he too was restored, and survived\r\nit fifteen years, dying in 1674; but his whole literary fame rests on work\r\npublished a quarter of a century before his death, and pretty certainly in\r\ngreat part written many years earlier.\r\n\r\nThe poems which then appeared were divided, in the published form, into two\r\nclasses: they may be divided, for purposes of poetical criticism, into\r\nthree. The _Hesperides_ (they are dated 1648, and the _Noble Numbers_ or\r\nsacred poems 1647; but both appeared together) consist in the first place\r\nof occasional poems, sometimes amatory, sometimes not; in the second, of\r\npersonal epigrams. Of this second class no human being who has any faculty\r\nof criticism can say any good. They are supposed by tradition to have been\r\ncomposed on parishioners: they may be hoped by charity (which has in this\r\ncase the support of literary criticism) to be merely literary\r\nexercises--bad imitations of Martial, through Ben Jonson. They are nastier\r\nthan the nastiest work of Swift; they are stupider than the stupidest\r\nattempts of Davies of Hereford; they are farther from the author's best\r\nthan the worst parts of Young's _Odes_ are from the best part of the _Night\r\nThoughts_. It is impossible without producing specimens (which God forbid\r\nthat any one who has a respect for Herrick, for literature, and for\r\ndecency, should do) to show how bad they are. Let it only be said that if\r\nthe worst epigram of Martial were stripped of Martial's wit, sense, and\r\nliterary form, it would be a kind of example of Herrick in this vein.\r\n\r\nIn his two other veins, but for certain tricks of speech, it is almost\r\nimpossible to recognise him for the same man. The secular vigour of the\r\n_Hesperides_, the spiritual vigour of the _Noble Numbers_, has rarely been\r\nequalled and never surpassed by any other writer. I cannot agree with Mr.\r\nGosse that Herrick is in any sense \"a Pagan.\" They had in his day shaken\r\noff the merely ascetic temper of the Middle Ages, and had not taken upon\r\nthem the mere materialism of the _Aufklaerung_, or the remorseful and\r\nsatiated attitude of the late eighteenth and nineteenth century. I believe\r\nthat the warmest of the Julia poems and the immortal \"Litany\" were written\r\nwith the same integrity of feeling. Here was a man who was grateful to the\r\nupper powers for the joys of life, or who was sorrowful and repentant\r\ntowards the upper powers when he felt that he had exceeded in enjoying\r\nthose joys, but who had no doubt of his gods, and no shame in approaching\r\nthem. The last--the absolutely last if we take his death-date--of those\r\npoets who have relished this life heartily, while heartily believing in\r\nanother, was Robert Herrick. There is not the slightest reason to suppose\r\nthat the _Hesperides_ were wholly _peches de jeunesse_ and the _Noble\r\nNumbers_ wholly pious palinodes. Both simply express, and express in a most\r\nvivid and distinct manner, the alternate or rather varying moods of a man\r\nof strong sensibilities, religious as well as sensual.\r\n\r\nOf the religious poems the already-mentioned \"Litany,\" while much the most\r\nfamiliar, is also far the best. There is nothing in English verse to equal\r\nit as an expression of religious fear; while there is also nothing in\r\nEnglish verse to equal the \"Thanksgiving,\" also well known, as an\r\nexpression of religious trust. The crystalline simplicity of Herrick's\r\nstyle deprives his religious poems of that fatal cut-and-dried appearance,\r\nthat vain repetition of certain phrases and thoughts, which mars the work\r\nof sacred poets generally, and which has led to an unjustly strong censure\r\nbeing laid on them by critics, so different from each other as Dr. Johnson\r\nand Mr. Matthew Arnold. As the alleged Paganism of some of Herrick's sacred\r\npoems exists only in the imagination of readers, so the alleged insincerity\r\nis equally hypothetical, and can only be supported by the argument\r\n(notoriously false to history and to human nature) that a man who could\r\nwrite the looser _Hesperides_ could not sincerely write the _Noble\r\nNumbers_. Every student of the lives of other men--every student of his own\r\nheart--knows, or should know, that this is an utter mistake.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, however, Herrick's most beautiful work is to be found in the\r\nprofane division, despite the admixture of the above-mentioned epigrams,\r\nthe dull foulness of which soils the most delightful pages to such an\r\nextent that, if it were ever allowable to take liberties with an author's\r\ndisposition of his own work, it would be allowable and desirable to pick\r\nthese ugly weeds out of the garden and stow them away in a rubbish heap of\r\nappendix all to themselves. Some of the best pieces of the _Hesperides_ are\r\neven better known than the two well-known _Noble Numbers_ above quoted. The\r\n\"Night Piece to Julia,\" the \"Daffodils,\" the splendid \"To Anthea,\" (\"Bid me\r\nto live\"), \"The Mad Maid's Song\" (worthy of the greatest of the generation\r\nbefore Herrick), the verses to Ben Jonson, those to Electra (\"I dare not\r\nask a kiss\"), the wonderful \"Burial Piece to Perilla,\" the \"Grace for a\r\nChild,\" the \"Corinna Maying\" (the chief of a large division of Herrick's\r\npoems which celebrate rustic festivals, superstitions, and folklore\r\ngenerally), the epitaph on Prudence Baldwin, and many others, are justly\r\nincluded in nearly all selections of English poetry, and many of them are\r\nknown by heart to every one who knows any poetry at all. One or two of the\r\nleast well known of them may perhaps be welcome again:--\r\n\r\n    \"Good morrow to the day so fair,\r\n      Good morning, sir, to you;\r\n    Good morrow to mine own torn hair\r\n      Bedabbled with the dew.\r\n\r\n    \"Good morning to this primrose too,\r\n      Good morrow to each maid;\r\n    That will with flowers the tomb bestrew\r\n      Wherein my love is laid.\r\n\r\n    \"Ah, woe is me, woe, woe is me,\r\n      Alack and well-a-day!\r\n    For pity, sir, find out that bee\r\n      That bore my love away.\r\n\r\n    \"I'll seek him in your bonnet brave,\r\n      I'll seek him in your eyes;\r\n    Nay, now I think, they've made his grave\r\n      I' th' bed of strawberries.\r\n\r\n    \"I'll seek him there: I know ere this\r\n      The cold, cold earth doth shake him;\r\n    But I will go, or send a kiss\r\n      By you, sir, to awake him.\r\n\r\n    \"Pray hurt him not; though he be dead\r\n      He knows well who do love him,\r\n    And who with green turfs rear his head,\r\n      And who do rudely move him.\r\n\r\n    \"He's soft and tender, pray take heed,\r\n      With bands of cowslips bind him,\r\n    And bring him home; but 'tis decreed\r\n      That I shall never find him.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"I dare not ask a kiss;\r\n      I dare not beg a smile;\r\n    Lest having that or this,\r\n      I might grow proud the while.\r\n\r\n    \"No, no--the utmost share\r\n      Of my desire shall be\r\n    Only to kiss that air\r\n      That lately kissed thee.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Here, a little child, I stand\r\n    Heaving up my either hand:\r\n    Cold as paddocks though they be\r\n    Here I lift them up to Thee,\r\n    For a benison to fall\r\n    On our meat and on us all.\r\n\r\n                        Amen.\"\r\n\r\nBut Herrick's charm is everywhere--except in the epigrams. It is very rare\r\nto find one of the hundreds of little poems which form his book destitute\r\nof the peculiar touch of phrasing, the eternising influence of style, which\r\ncharacterises the poetry of this particular period so remarkably. The\r\nsubject may be the merest trifle, the thought a hackneyed or insignificant\r\none. But the amber to enshrine the fly is always there in larger or\r\nsmaller, in clearer or more clouded, shape. There has often been a certain\r\ncontempt (connected no doubt with certain general critical errors as they\r\nseem to me, with which I shall deal at the end of this chapter) flavouring\r\ncritical notices of Herrick. I do not think that any one who judges poetry\r\nas poetry, who keeps its several kinds apart and does not demand epic\r\ngraces in lyric, dramatic substance in an anthologia, could ever feel or\r\nhint such a contempt. Whatever Herrick may have been as a man (of which we\r\nknow very little, and for which we need care less), he was a most exquisite\r\nand complete poet in his own way, neither was that way one to be lightly\r\nspoken of.\r\n\r\nIndissolubly connected with Herrick in age, in character, and in the\r\nsingularly unjust criticism which has at various times been bestowed on\r\nhim, is Thomas Carew. His birth-date has been very differently given as\r\n1587 and (that now preferred) 1598; but he died nearly forty years before\r\nthe author of the _Hesperides_, and nearly ten before the _Hesperides_\r\nthemselves were published, while his own poems were never collected till\r\nafter his own death. He was of a Gloucestershire branch of the famous\r\nDevonshire family of Carew, Cary, or Cruwys, was of Merton College, Oxford,\r\nand the Temple, travelled, followed the Court, was a disciple of Ben\r\nJonson, and a member of the learned and accomplished society of Clarendon's\r\nearlier days, obtained a place in the household of Charles I., is said by\r\nhis friend Hyde to have turned to devotion after a somewhat libertine life,\r\nand died in 1639, before the evil days of triumphant Puritanism, _felix\r\nopportunitate mortis_. He wrote little, and the scantiness of his\r\nproduction, together with the supposed pains it cost him, is ridiculed in\r\nSuckling's doggerel \"Sessions of the Poets.\" But this reproach (which Carew\r\nshares with Gray, and with not a few others of the most admirable names in\r\nliterature), unjust as it is, is less unjust than the general tone of\r\ncriticism on Carew since. The _locus classicus_ of depreciation both in\r\nregard to him and to Herrick is to be found, as might be expected, in one\r\nof the greatest, and one of the most wilfully capricious and untrustworthy\r\nof English critics, in Hazlitt. I am sorry to say that there can be little\r\nhesitation in setting down the extraordinary misjudgment of the passage in\r\nquestion (it occurs in the sixth Lecture on Elizabethan Literature), in\r\npart, at least, to the fact that Herrick, Carew, and Crashaw, who are\r\nsummarily damned in it, were Royalists. If there were any doubt about the\r\nmatter, it would be settled by the encomium bestowed in the very same\r\npassage on Marvell, who is, no doubt, as Hazlitt says, a true poet, but who\r\nas a poet is but seldom at the highest height of the authors of \"The\r\nLitany,\" \"The Rapture,\" and \"The Flaming Heart.\" Hazlitt, then, while on\r\nhis way to tell us that Herrick's two best pieces are some trivial\r\nanacreontics about Cupid and the Bees--things hackneyed through a dozen\r\nliteratures, and with no recommendation but a borrowed prettiness--while\r\nabout, I say, to deny Herrick the spirit of love or wine, and in the same\r\nbreath with the dismissal of Crashaw as a \"hectic enthusiast,\" informs us\r\nthat Carew was \"an elegant Court trifler,\" and describes his style as a\r\n\"frequent mixture of the superficial and commonplace, with far-fetched and\r\nimprobable conceits.\"\r\n\r\nWhat Carew really is, and what he may be peremptorily declared to be in\r\nopposition even to such a critic as Hazlitt, is something quite different.\r\nHe is one of the most perfect masters of lyrical form in English poetry. He\r\npossesses a command of the overlapped heroic couplet, which for sweep and\r\nrush of rhythm cannot be surpassed anywhere. He has, perhaps in a greater\r\ndegree than any poet of that time of conceits, the knack of modulating the\r\nextravagances of fancy by the control of reason, so that he never falls\r\ninto the unbelievableness of Donne, or Crashaw, or Cleveland. He had a\r\ndelicacy, when he chose to be delicate, which is quintessential, and a\r\nvigour which is thoroughly manly. Best of all, perhaps, he had the\r\nintelligence and the self-restraint to make all his poems wholes, and not\r\nmere congeries of verses. There is always, both in the scheme of his\r\nmeaning and the scheme of his metre, a definite plan of rise and fall, a\r\nconcerted effect. That these great merits were accompanied by not\r\ninconsiderable defects is true. Carew lacks the dewy freshness, the\r\nunstudied grace of Herrick. He is even more frankly and uncontrolledly\r\nsensual, and has paid the usual and inevitable penalty that his best poem,\r\n_The Rapture_, is, for the most part, unquotable, while another, if he\r\ncarried out its principles in this present year of grace, would run him the\r\nrisk of imprisonment with hard labour. His largest attempt--the masque\r\ncalled _Coelum Britannicum_--is heavy. His smaller poems, beautiful as they\r\nare, suffer somewhat from want of variety of subject. There is just so much\r\ntruth in Suckling's impertinence that the reader of Carew sometimes catches\r\nhimself repeating the lines of Carew's master, \"Still to be neat, still to\r\nbe drest,\" not indeed in full agreement with them, but not in exact\r\ndisagreement. One misses the \"wild civility\" of Herrick. This\r\nacknowledgment, I trust, will save me from any charge of overvaluing Carew.\r\n\r\nA man might, however, be easily tempted to overvalue him, who observes his\r\nbeauties, and who sees how, preserving the force, the poetic spell, of the\r\ntime, he was yet able, without in the least descending to the correctness\r\nof Waller and his followers, to introduce into his work something also\r\npreserving it from the weaknesses and inequalities which deface that of\r\nalmost all his contemporaries, and which, as we shall see, make much of the\r\ndramatic and poetical work of 1630-1660 a chaos of slipshod deformity to\r\nany one who has the sense of poetical form. It is an unwearying delight to\r\nread and re-read the second of his poems, the \"Persuasions to Love,\"\r\naddressed to a certain A. L. That the sentiment is common enough matters\r\nlittle; the commonest things in poetry are always the best. But the\r\ndelicate interchange of the catalectic and acatalectic dimeter, the\r\nwonderful plays and changes of cadence, the opening, as it were, of fresh\r\nstops at the beginning of each new paragraph of the verse, so that the\r\nmusic acquires a new colour, the felicity of the several phrases, the\r\ncunning heightening of the passion as the poet comes to \"Oh! love me then,\r\nand now begin it,\" and the dying fall of the close, make up to me, at\r\nleast, most charming pastime. It is not the same kind of pleasure, no\r\ndoubt, as that given by such an outburst as Crashaw's, to be mentioned\r\npresently, or by such pieces as the great soliloquies of Shakespere. Any\r\none may say, if he likes to use words which are question-begging, when not\r\nstrictly meaningless, that it is not such a \"high\" kind. But it is a kind,\r\nand in that kind perfect.\r\n\r\nCarew's best pieces, besides _The Rapture_, are the beautiful \"Ask me no\r\nmore,\" the first stanza of which is the weakest; the fine couplet poem,\r\n\"The Cruel Mistress,\" whose closing distich--\r\n\r\n    \"Of such a goddess no times leave record,\r\n    That burned the temple where she was adored\"--\r\n\r\nDryden conveyed with the wise and unblushing boldness which great poets\r\nuse; the \"Deposition from love,\" written in one of those combinations of\r\neights and sixes, the melodious charm of which seems to have died with the\r\nseventeenth century; the song, \"He that loves a rosy cheek,\" which, by the\r\nunusual morality of its sentiments, has perhaps secured a fame not quite\r\ndue to its poetical merits; the epitaph on Lady Mary Villers; the song\r\n\"Would you know what's soft?\" the song to his inconstant mistress:\r\n\r\n    \"When thou, poor excommunicate\r\n    From all the joys of love, shalt see\r\n    The full reward, and glorious fate\r\n    Which my strong faith shall purchase me,\r\n    Then curse thine own inconstancy.\r\n\r\n    \"A fairer hand than thine shall cure\r\n    That heart which thy false oaths did wound;\r\n    And to my soul, a soul more pure\r\n    Than thine, shall by love's hand be bound,\r\n    And both with equal glory crown'd.\r\n\r\n    \"Then shalt thou weep, entreat, complain\r\n    To Love, as I did once to thee;\r\n    When all thy tears shall be as vain\r\n    As mine were then, for thou shalt be\r\n    Damn'd for thy false apostacy.\"--\r\n\r\nthe pleasant pictures of the country houses of Wrest and Saxham; the\r\ncharming conceit of \"Red and white roses\":\r\n\r\n    \"Read in these roses the sad story\r\n    Of my hard fate and your own glory:\r\n    In the white you may discover\r\n    The paleness of a fainting lover;\r\n    In the red, the flames still feeding\r\n    On my heart with fresh wounds bleeding.\r\n    The white will tell you how I languish,\r\n    And the red express my anguish:\r\n    The white my innocence displaying\r\n    The red my martyrdom betraying.\r\n    The frowns that on your brow resided\r\n    Have those roses thus divided;\r\n    Oh! let your smiles but clear the weather\r\n    And then they both shall grow together.\"--\r\n\r\nand lastly, though it would be easy to extend this already long list of\r\nselections from a by no means extensive collection of poems, the grand\r\nelegy on Donne. By this last the reproach of vain and amatorious trifling\r\nwhich has been so often levelled at Carew is at once thrown back and\r\nblunted. No poem shows so great an influence on the masculine panegyrics\r\nwith which Dryden was to enrich the English of the next generation, and few\r\nare fuller of noteworthy phrases. The splendid epitaph which closes it--\r\n\r\n    \"Here lies a king that ruled as he thought fit\r\n    The universal monarchy of wit\"--\r\n\r\nis only the best passage, not the only good one, and it may be matched with\r\na fine and just description of English, ushered by a touch of acute\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\n    \"Thou shalt yield no precedence, but of time,\r\n    And the blind fate of language, whose tuned chime\r\n    More charms the outward sense: yet thou mayst claim\r\n    From so great disadvantage greater fame.\r\n    Since to the awe of thine imperious wit\r\n    Our troublesome language bends, made only fit\r\n    With her tough thick-ribbed hoops to gird about\r\n    Thy giant fancy, which had proved too stout\r\n    For their soft melting phrases.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it is the man who could write like this that Hazlitt calls an \"elegant\r\nCourt trifler!\"\r\n\r\nThe third of this great trio of poets, and with them the most remarkable of\r\nour whole group, was Richard Crashaw. He completes Carew and Herrick both\r\nin his qualities and (if a kind of bull may be permitted) in his defects,\r\nafter a fashion almost unexampled elsewhere and supremely interesting.\r\nHardly any one of the three could have appeared at any other time, and not\r\none but is distinguished from the others in the most marked way. Herrick,\r\ndespite his sometimes rather obtrusive learning, is emphatically the\r\nnatural man. He does not show much sign of the influence of good society,\r\nhis merits as well as his faults have a singular unpersonal and, if I may\r\nso say, _terraefilian_ connotation. Carew is a gentleman before all; but a\r\nrather profane gentleman. Crashaw is religious everywhere. Again, Herrick\r\nand Carew, despite their strong savour of the fashion of the time, are\r\neminently critics as well as poets. Carew has not let one piece critically\r\nunworthy of him pass his censorship: Herrick (if we exclude the filthy and\r\nfoolish epigrams into which he was led by corrupt following of Ben) has\r\nbeen equally careful. These two bards may have trouble with the _censor\r\nmorum_,--the _censor literarum_ they can brave with perfect confidence. It\r\nis otherwise with Crashaw. That he never, as far as can be seen, edited the\r\nbulk of his work for press at all matters little or nothing. But there is\r\nnot in his work the slightest sign of the exercise of any critical faculty\r\nbefore, during, or after production. His masterpiece, one of the most\r\nastonishing things in English or any other literature, comes without\r\nwarning at the end of _The Flaming Heart_. For page after page the poet has\r\nbeen poorly playing on some trifling conceits suggested by the picture of\r\nSaint Theresa and a seraph. First he thinks the painter ought to have\r\nchanged the attributes; then he doubts whether a lesser change will not do;\r\nand always he treats his subject in a vein of grovelling and grotesque\r\nconceit which the boy Dryden in the stage of his elegy on Lord Hastings\r\nwould have disdained. And then in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,\r\nwithout warning of any sort, the metre changes, the poet's inspiration\r\ncatches fire, and there rushes up into the heaven of poetry this marvellous\r\nrocket of song:--\r\n\r\n    \"Live in these conquering leaves: live all the same;\r\n    And walk through all tongues one triumphant flame;\r\n    Live here, great heart; and love, and die, and kill;\r\n    And bleed, and wound, and yield, and conquer still.\r\n    Let this immortal life where'er it comes\r\n    Walk in a crowd of loves and martyrdoms.\r\n    Let mystic deaths wait on't; and wise souls be\r\n    The love-slain witnesses of this life of thee.\r\n    O sweet incendiary! show here thy art,\r\n    Upon this carcase of a hard cold heart;\r\n    Let all thy scatter'd shafts of light, that play\r\n    Among the leaves of thy large books of day,\r\n    Combin'd against this breast at once break in,\r\n    And take away from me myself and sin;\r\n    This gracious robbery shall thy bounty be\r\n    And my best fortunes such fair spoils of me.\r\n    O thou undaunted daughter of desires!\r\n    By all thy pow'r of lights and fires;\r\n    By all the eagle in thee, all the dove;\r\n    By all thy lives and deaths of love;\r\n    By thy large draughts of intellectual day;\r\n    And by thy thirsts of love more large than they;\r\n    By all thy brim-fill'd bowls of fierce desire;\r\n    By thy last morning's draught of liquid fire;\r\n    By the full kingdom of that final kiss\r\n    That seized thy parting soul, and seal'd thee his;\r\n    By all the heavens thou hast in him,\r\n    (Fair sister of the seraphim)\r\n    By all of him we have in thee;\r\n    Leave nothing of myself in me.\r\n    Let me so read thy life, that I\r\n    Unto all life of mine may die.\"\r\n\r\nThe contrast is perhaps unique as regards the dead colourlessness of the\r\nbeginning, and the splendid colour of the end. But contrasts like it occur\r\nall over Crashaw's work.\r\n\r\nHe was a much younger man than either of the poets with whom we have\r\nleashed him, and his birth year used to be put at 1616, though Dr. Grosart\r\nhas made it probable that it was three years earlier. His father was a\r\nstern Anglican clergyman of extremely Protestant leanings, his mother died\r\nwhen Crashaw was young, but his stepmother appears to have been most\r\nunnovercal. Crashaw was educated at Charterhouse, and then went to\r\nCambridge, where in 1637 he became a fellow of Peterhouse, and came in for\r\nthe full tide of high church feeling, to which (under the mixed influence\r\nof Laud's policy, of the ascetic practices of the Ferrars of Gidding, and\r\nof a great architectural development afterwards defaced if not destroyed by\r\nPuritan brutality) Cambridge was even more exposed than Oxford. The\r\noutbreak of the civil war may or may not have found Crashaw at Cambridge;\r\nhe was at any rate deprived of his fellowship for not taking the covenant\r\nin 1643, and driven into exile. Already inclined doctrinally and in matters\r\nof practice to the older communion, and despairing of the resurrection of\r\nthe Church of England after her sufferings at the hands of the Parliament,\r\nCrashaw joined the Church of Rome, and journeyed to its metropolis. He was\r\nattached to the suit of Cardinal Pallotta, but is said to have been shocked\r\nby Italian manners. The cardinal procured him a canonry at Loretto, and\r\nthis he hastened to take up, but died in 1649 with suspicions of poison,\r\nwhich are not impossibly, but at the same time by no means necessarily\r\ntrue. His poems had already appeared under the double title of _Steps to\r\nthe Temple_ (sacred), and _Delights of the Muses_ (profane), but not under\r\nhis own editorship, or it would seem with his own choice of title. Several\r\nother editions followed,--one later than his death, with curious\r\nillustrations said to be, in part at least, of his own design. Manuscript\r\nsources, as in the case of some other poets of the time, have considerably\r\nenlarged the collection since. But a great part of it consists of epigrams\r\n(in the wide sense, and almost wholly sacred) in the classical tongues,\r\nwhich were sometimes translated by Crashaw himself. These are not always\r\ncorrect in style or prosody, but are often interesting. The famous line in\r\nreference to the miracle of Cana,\r\n\r\n    \"Vidit et erubuit nympha pudica Deum,\"\r\n\r\nis assigned to Crashaw as a boy at Cambridge; of his later faculty in the\r\nsame way the elaborate and, in its way, beautiful poem entitled _Bulla_\r\n(the Bubble) is the most remarkable.\r\n\r\nOur chief subject, however, is the English poems proper, sacred and\r\nprofane. In almost all of these there is noticeable an extraordinary\r\ninequality, the same in kind, if not in degree, as that on which we have\r\ncommented in the case of _The Flaming Heart_. Crashaw is never quite so\r\ngreat as there; but he is often quite as small. His exasperating lack of\r\nself-criticism has sometimes led selectors to make a cento out of his\r\npoems--notably in the case of the exceedingly pretty \"Wishes to His Unknown\r\nMistress,\" beginning, \"Whoe'er she be, That not impossible she, That shall\r\ncommand my heart and me\"--a poem, let it be added, which excuses this\r\ndubious process much less than most, inasmuch as nothing in it is\r\npositively bad, though it is rather too long. Here is the opening, preceded\r\nby a piece from another poem, \"A Hymn to Saint Theresa\":--\r\n\r\n    \"Those rare works, where thou shalt leave writ\r\n    Love's noble history, with wit\r\n    Taught thee by none but him, while here\r\n    They feed our souls, shall clothe thine there\r\n    Each heavenly word by whose hid flame\r\n    Our hard hearts shall strike fire, the same\r\n    Shall flourish on thy brows and be\r\n    Both fire to us and flame to thee:\r\n    Whose light shall live bright, in thy face\r\n    By glory, in our hearts by grace.\r\n\r\n    \"Thou shalt look round about, and see\r\n    Thousands of crown'd souls throng to be\r\n    Themselves thy crown, sons of thy vows:\r\n    The virgin births with which thy spouse\r\n    Made fruitful thy fair soul; go now\r\n    And with them all about thee, bow\r\n    To Him, 'Put on' (He'll say) 'put on,\r\n    My rosy love, that thy rich zone,\r\n    Sparkling with the sacred flames,\r\n    Of thousand souls whose happy names\r\n    Heaven heaps upon thy score, thy bright\r\n    Life brought them first to kiss the light\r\n    That kindled them to stars.' And so\r\n    Thou with the Lamb thy Lord shall go,\r\n    And whereso'er He sets His white\r\n    Steps, walk with Him those ways of light.\r\n    Which who in death would live to see\r\n    Must learn in life to die like thee.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Whoe'er she be,\r\n    That not impossible she,\r\n    That shall command my heart and me;\r\n\r\n    \"Where'er she lie,\r\n    Lock'd up from mortal eye,\r\n    In shady leaves of destiny;\r\n\r\n    \"Till that ripe birth\r\n    Of studied Fate stand forth,\r\n    And teach her fair steps to our earth:\r\n\r\n    \"Till that divine\r\n    Idea take a shrine\r\n    Of crystal flesh, through which to shine:\r\n\r\n    \"Meet you her, my wishes\r\n    Bespeak her to my blisses,\r\n    And be ye call'd, my absent kisses.\"\r\n\r\nThe first hymn to Saint Theresa, to which _The Flaming Heart_ is a kind of\r\nappendix, was written when Crashaw was still an Anglican (for which he did\r\nnot fail, later, to make a characteristic and very pretty, though quite\r\nunnecessary, apology). It has no passage quite up to the\r\nInvocation--Epiphonema, to give it the technical term--of the later poem.\r\nBut it is, on the contrary, good almost throughout, and is, for uniform\r\nexaltation, far the best of Crashaw's poems. Yet such uniform exaltation\r\nmust be seldom sought in him. It is in his little bursts, such as that in\r\nthe stanza beginning, \"O mother turtle dove,\" that his charm consists.\r\nOften, as in verse after verse of _The Weeper_, it has an unearthly\r\ndelicacy and witchery which only Blake, in a few snatches, has ever\r\nequalled; while at other times the poet seems to invent, in the most casual\r\nand unthinking fashion, new metrical effects and new jewelries of diction\r\nwhich the greatest lyric poets since--Coleridge, Shelley, Lord Tennyson,\r\nMr. Swinburne--have rather deliberately imitated than spontaneously\r\nrecovered. Yet to all this charm there is no small drawback. The very\r\nmaddest and most methodless of the \"Metaphysicals\" cannot touch Crashaw in\r\nhis tasteless use of conceits. When he, in _The Weeper_ just above referred\r\nto, calls the tears of Magdalene \"Wat'ry brothers,\" and \"Simpering sons of\r\nthose fair eyes,\" and when, in the most intolerable of all the poet's\r\nexcesses, the same eyes are called \"Two waking baths, two weeping motions,\r\nPortable and compendious oceans,\" which follow our Lord about the hills of\r\nGalilee, it is almost difficult to know whether to feel most contempt or\r\nindignation for a man who could so write. It is fair to say that there are\r\nvarious readings and omissions in the different editions which affect both\r\nthese passages. Yet the offence is that Crashaw should ever have written\r\nthem at all. Amends, however, are sure to be made before the reader has\r\nread much farther. Crashaw's longest poems--a version of Marini's _Sospetto\r\nd'Herode_, and one of the rather overpraised \"Lover and Nightingale\" story\r\nof Strada--are not his best; the metre in which both are written, though\r\nthe poet manages it well, lacks the extraordinary charm of his lyric\r\nmeasures. It does not appear that the \"Not impossible she\" ever made her\r\nappearance, and probably for a full half of his short life Crashaw burnt\r\nonly with religious fire. But no Englishman has expressed that fire as he\r\nhas, and none in his expression of any sentiment, sacred and profane, has\r\ndropped such notes of ethereal music. At his best he is far above singing,\r\nat his worst he is below a very childish prattle. But even then he is never\r\ncoarse, never offensive, not very often actually dull; and everywhere he\r\nmakes amends by flowers of the divinest poetry. Mr. Pope, who borrowed not\r\na little from him, thought, indeed, that you could find nothing of \"The\r\nreal part of poetry\" (correct construction and so forth) in Crashaw; and\r\nMr. Hayley gently rebukes Cowley (after observing that if Pope borrowed\r\nfrom Crashaw, it was \"as the sun borrows from the earth\") for his \"glowing\r\npanegyrick.\" Now, if the real part of poetry is anywhere in Hayley, or\r\nquintessentially in Pope, it certainly is not in Crashaw.\r\n\r\nThe group or school (for it is not easy to decide on either word, and\r\nobjections might be taken to each) at the head of which Herrick, Carew, and\r\nCrashaw must be placed, and which included Herbert and his band of sacred\r\nsingers, included also not a few minor groups, sufficiently different from\r\neach other, but all marked off sharply from the innovating and classical\r\nschool of Waller and his followers, which it is not proposed to treat in\r\nthis volume. All, without exception, show the influence in different ways\r\nof Ben Jonson and of Donne. But each has its own peculiarity. We find these\r\npeculiarities, together with anticipations of post-Reformation\r\ncharacteristics, mixed very curiously in the miscellanies of the time.\r\nThese are interesting enough, and may be studied with advantage, if not\r\nalso with pleasure, in the principal of them, _Wit's Recreations_ (1640).\r\nThis, with certain kindred works (_Wit Restored_, and the very unsavoury\r\n_Musarum Deliciae_ of Sir John Mennis and Dr. Smith), has been more than\r\nonce republished. In these curious collections, to mention only one\r\ninstance, numerous pieces of Herrick's appeared with considerable variants\r\nfrom the text of the _Hesperides_; and in their pages things old and new,\r\ncharming pastoral poems, _vers de societe_ of very unequal merit, ballads,\r\nsatires, epigrams, and a large quantity of mere scatology and doggerel, are\r\nheaped together pell-mell. Songs from the dramatists, especially Fletcher,\r\nmake their appearance, sometimes with slight variants, and there are forms\r\nof the drinking song in _Gammer Gurton's Needle_ long after, and of Sir\r\nJohn Suckling's \"Ballad on a Wedding,\" apparently somewhat before, their\r\nrespective publication in their proper places. Here is the joke about the\r\nwife and the almanack which reckless tradition has told of Dryden; printed\r\nwhen Lady Elizabeth Howard was in the nursery, and Dryden was not yet at\r\nWestminster. Here we learn how, probably about the second or third decade\r\nof the century, the favourite authors of learned ladies were \"Wither,\r\nDraiton, and Balzack\" (Guez de Balzac of the _Letters_), a very singular\r\ntrio; and how some at least loved the \"easy ambling\" of Heywood's prose,\r\nbut thought that he \"grovelled on the stage,\" which it must be confessed he\r\nnot uncommonly did. _Wit Restored_ contains the charming \"Phillida flouts\r\nMe,\" with other real \"delights.\" Even Milton makes his appearance in these\r\ncollections, which continued to be popular for more than a century, and\r\nacquired at intervals fresh vogue from the great names of Dryden and Pope.\r\n\r\nNeglecting or returning from these, we may class the minor Caroline poets\r\nunder the following heads. There are belated Elizabethans like Habington,\r\nsacred poets of the school of Herbert, translators like Stanley, Sherburne,\r\nand Quarles, philosophico-theological poets like Joseph Beaumont and More,\r\nand poets of society, such as Lovelace and Suckling, whose class\r\ndegenerated into a class of boon companion song-writers, such as Alexander\r\nBrome, and, at the extremity of our present period, Charles Cotton, in\r\nwhose verse (as for the matter of that in the famous muses of Lovelace and\r\nSuckling themselves) the rapidly degenerating prosody of the time is\r\nsometimes painfully evident. This is also apparent (though it is\r\ncompensated by much exquisite poetry, and on the strictly lyric side rarely\r\noffends) in the work of Randolph, Corbet, Cartwright, Chamberlayne of the\r\n_Pharonnida_, Sidney Godolphin, Shakerley Marmion, Cleveland, Benlowes,\r\nKynaston, John Hall, the enigmatic Chalkhill, Patrick Carey, Bishop King.\r\nThese about exhaust the list of poets who must be characterised here,\r\nthough it could be extended. Cowley, Marvell, and Waller fall outside our\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\nGeorge Herbert, the one popular name, if we except Lovelace and Suckling,\r\nof the last paragraph, was born at Montgomery Castle in 1593, of the great\r\nhouse now represented in the English peerage by the holders of the titles\r\nof Pembroke, Carnarvon, and Powis. George was the younger brother of the\r\nequally well-known Lord Herbert of Cherbury; and after being for some years\r\npublic orator at Cambridge, turned, it is said, on some despite or\r\ndisappointment, from secular to sacred business, accepted the living of\r\nBemerton, and, after holding it for a short time, died in 1633. Walton's\r\n_Life_ was hardly needed to fix Herbert in the popular mind, for his famous\r\nvolume of sacred poems, _The Temple_, would have done so, and has done so\r\nfar more firmly. It was not his only book by any means; he had displayed\r\nmuch wit as quite a boy in counter-lampooning Andrew Melville's ponderous\r\nand impudent _Anti-Tami-Cami-Categoria_, an attack on the English\r\nuniversities; and afterwards he wrote freely in Greek, Latin, and English,\r\nboth in prose and verse. Nothing, however, but _The Temple_ has held\r\npopular estimation, and that has held it firmly, being as much helped by\r\nthe Tractarian as by the Romantic movement. It may be confessed without\r\nshame and without innuendo that Herbert has been on the whole a greater\r\nfavourite with readers than with critics, and the reason is obvious. He is\r\nnot prodigal of the finest strokes of poetry. To take only his own\r\ncontemporaries, and undoubtedly pupils, his gentle moralising and devotion\r\nare tame and cold beside the burning glow of Crashaw, commonplace and\r\npopular beside the intellectual subtlety and, now and then, the inspired\r\ntouch of Vaughan. But he never drops into the flatness and the extravagance\r\nof both these writers, and his beauties, assuredly not mean in themselves,\r\nand very constantly present, are both in kind and in arrangement admirably\r\nsuited to the average comprehension. He is quaint and conceited; but his\r\nquaintnesses and conceits are never beyond the reach of any tolerably\r\nintelligent understanding. He is devout, but his devotion does not\r\ntransgress into the more fantastic regions of piety. He is a mystic, but of\r\nthe more exoteric school of mysticism. He expresses common needs, common\r\nthoughts, the everyday emotions of the Christian, just sublimated\r\nsufficiently to make them attractive. The fashion and his own taste gave\r\nhim a pleasing quaintness, which his good sense kept from being ever\r\nobscure or offensive or extravagant. The famous \"Sweet day so cool, so\r\ncalm, so bright,\" and many short passages which are known to every one,\r\nexpress Herbert perfectly. The thought is obvious, usual, in no sense far\r\nfetched. The morality is plain and simple. The expression, with a\r\nsufficient touch of the daintiness of the time, has nothing that is\r\nextraordinarily or ravishingly felicitous whether in phrasing or versing.\r\nHe is, in short, a poet whom all must respect; whom those that are in\r\nsympathy with his vein of thought cannot but revere; who did England an\r\ninestimable service, by giving to the highest and purest thoughts that\r\nfamiliar and abiding poetic garb which contributes so much to fix any\r\nthoughts in the mind, and of which, to tell the truth, poetry has been much\r\nmore prodigal to other departments of thought by no means so well\r\ndeserving. But it is impossible to call him a great poet even in his own\r\ndifficult class. The early Latin hymn writers are there to show what a\r\ngreat religious poet must be like. Crashaw, if his genius had been less\r\nirregular and jaculative, might have been such. Herbert is not, and could\r\nnot have been. With him it is an almost invariable custom to class Vaughan\r\nthe \"Silurist,\" and a common one to unite George Sandys, the traveller,\r\ntranslator of Ovid, and paraphrast of the Psalms and other parts of the\r\nBible. Sandys, an older man than Herbert by fifteen, and than Vaughan by\r\nmore than forty years, published rather late, so that he came as a sacred\r\npoet after Herbert, and not long before Vaughan. He was son of the\r\nArchbishop of York, and brother of that Edwin Sandys who was a pupil of\r\nHooker, and who is said to have been present on the melancholy occasion\r\nwhen the judicious one was \"called to rock the cradle.\" He is interesting\r\nfor a singular and early mastery of the couplet, which the following\r\nextract will show:--\r\n\r\n    \"O Thou, who all things hast of nothing made,\r\n    Whose hand the radiant firmament displayed,\r\n    With such an undiscerned swiftness hurled\r\n    About the steadfast centre of the world;\r\n    Against whose rapid course the restless sun,\r\n    And wandering flames in varied motions run.\r\n    Which heat, light, life infuse; time, night, and day\r\n    Distinguish; in our human bodies sway:\r\n    That hung'st the solid earth in fleeting air\r\n    Veined with clear springs which ambient seas repair.\r\n    In clouds the mountains wrap their hoary heads;\r\n    Luxurious valleys clothed with flowery meads;\r\n    Her trees yield fruit and shade; with liberal breasts\r\n    All creatures she, their common mother, feasts.\"\r\n\r\nHenry Vaughan was born in 1622, published _Poems_ in 1646 (for some of\r\nwhich he afterwards expressed a not wholly necessary repentance), _Olor\r\nIscanus_ (from Isca Silurum) in 1651, and _Silex Scintillans_, his\r\nbest-known book, in 1650 and 1655. He also published verses much later, and\r\ndid not die till 1695, being the latest lived of any man who has a claim to\r\nappear in this book, but his aftergrowths were not happy. To say that\r\nVaughan is a poet of one poem would not be true. But the universally known\r\n\r\n    \"They are all gone into the world of light\"\r\n\r\nis so very much better than anything else that he has done that it would be\r\nhardly fair to quote anything else, unless we could quote a great deal.\r\nLike Herbert, and in pretty obvious imitation of him, he set himself to\r\nbend the prevailing fancy for quips and quaintnesses into sacred uses, to\r\nsee that the Devil should not have all the best conceits. But he is not so\r\nuniformly successful, though he has greater depth and greater originality\r\nof thought.\r\n\r\nLovelace and Suckling are inextricably connected together, not merely by\r\ntheir style of poetry, but by their advocacy of the same cause, their date,\r\nand their melancholy end. Both (Suckling in 1609, Lovelace nine years\r\nlater) were born to large fortunes, both spent them, at least partially, in\r\nthe King's cause, and both died miserably,--Suckling, in 1642, by his own\r\nhand, his mind, according to a legend, unhinged by the tortures of the\r\nInquisition; Lovelace, two years before the Restoration, a needy though not\r\nan exiled cavalier, in London purlieus. Both have written songs of quite\r\nmarvellous and unparalleled exquisiteness, and both have left doggerel\r\nwhich would disgrace a schoolboy. Both, it may be suspected, held the\r\ndoctrine which Suckling openly champions, that a gentleman should not take\r\ntoo much trouble about his verses. The result, however, was in Lovelace's\r\ncase more disastrous than in Suckling's. It is not quite true that Lovelace\r\nleft nothing worth reading but the two immortal songs, \"To Lucasta on going\r\nto the Wars\" and \"To Althea from Prison;\" and it is only fair to say that\r\nthe corrupt condition of his text is evidently due, at least in part, to\r\nincompetent printing and the absence of revision. \"The Grasshopper\" is\r\nalmost worthy of the two better-known pieces, and there are others not far\r\nbelow it. But on the whole any one who knows those two (and who does not?)\r\nmay neglect Lovelace with safety. Suckling, even putting his dramatic work\r\naside, is not to be thus treated. True, he is often careless in the bad\r\nsense as well as in the good, though the doggerel of the \"Sessions\" and\r\nsome other pieces is probably intentional. But in his own vein, that of\r\ncoxcombry that is not quite cynical, and is quite intelligent, he is\r\nmarvellously happy. The famous song in _Aglaura_, the Allegro to Lovelace's\r\nPenseroso, \"Why so pale and wan, fond lover?\" is scarcely better than \"'Tis\r\nnow since I sat down before That foolish fort a heart,\" or \"Out upon it! I\r\nhave loved Three whole days together.\" Nor in more serious veins is the\r\nauthor to be slighted, as in \"The Dance;\" while as for the \"Ballad on a\r\nWedding,\" the best parts of this are by common consent incomparable. Side\r\nby side by these are to be found, as in Lovelace, pieces that will not even\r\nscan, and, as _not_ in Lovelace (who is not seldom loose but never nasty),\r\npieces of a dull and disgusting obscenity. But we do not go to Suckling for\r\nthese; we go to him for his easy grace, his agreeable impudence, his\r\nscandalous mock-disloyalty (for it is only mock-disloyalty after all) to\r\nthe \"Lord of Terrible Aspect,\" whom all his elder contemporaries worshipped\r\nso piously. Suckling's inconstancy and Lovelace's constancy may or may not\r\nbe equally poetical,--there is some reason for thinking that the lover of\r\nAlthea was actually driven to something like despair by the loss of his\r\nmistress. But that matters to us very little. The songs remain, and remain\r\nyet unsurpassed, as the most perfect celebrations, in one case of\r\nchivalrous devotion, in the other of the coxcomb side of gallantry, that\r\nliterature contains or is likely ever to contain. The songwriting faculty\r\nof the English, which had broken out some half century before, and had\r\nproduced so many masterpieces, was near its death, or at least near the\r\ntrance from which Burns and Blake revived it more than a century later,\r\nwhich even Dryden's superhuman faculty of verse could only galvanise. But\r\nat the last it threw off by the mouths of men, who otherwise seem to have\r\nhad very ordinary poetical powers, this little group of triumphs in song,\r\nto which have to be added the raptures--equally strange and sweet, equally\r\nunmatched of their kind, but nobler and more masculine--of the \"Great\r\nMarquis,\" the few and wonderful lines of Montrose. To quote \"My dear and\r\nonly love, I pray,\" or \"Great, good, and just, could I but rate,\" would be\r\nalmost as much an insult to the reader as to quote the above-mentioned\r\nlittle masterpieces of the two less heroic English cavaliers.\r\n\r\nQuarles, More, and Joseph Beaumont form, as it were, a kind of appendix to\r\nthe poetry of Herbert and Vaughan--an appendix very much less distinguished\r\nby poetical power, but very interesting as displaying the character of the\r\ntime and the fashion (strange enough to us moderns) in which almost every\r\ninterest of that time found its natural way into verse. The enormous\r\npopularity of Francis Quarles's _Emblems_ and _Enchiridion_ accounts to\r\nsome extent for the very unjust ridicule which has been lavished on him by\r\nmen of letters of his own and later times. But the silly antithesis of\r\nPope, a writer who, great as he was, was almost as ignorant of literary\r\nhistory as his model, Boileau, ought to prejudice no one, and it is\r\nstrictly true that Quarles's enormous volume hides, to some extent, his\r\nmerits. Born in 1592 at Romford, of a gentle though not very distinguished\r\nfamily, which enters into that curious literary genealogy of Swift, Dryden,\r\nand Herrick, he was educated at Cambridge, became cup-bearer to the\r\nill-fated and romantically renowned \"Goody Palsgrave,\" held the post which\r\nMiddleton and Jonson had held, of chronologer to the city of London,\r\nfollowed the King to Oxford to his loss, having previously had losses in\r\nIreland, and died early in 1644, leaving his memory to be defended in a\r\nrather affecting document by his widow, Ursula. Quarles was a kind of\r\njournalist to whom the vehicle of verse came more easily than the vehicle\r\nof prose, and the dangers of that state of things are well known. A mere\r\nlist of his work (the _Enchiridion_ is in prose, and a good thing too)\r\nwould far exceed any space that can be given to him here. All Quarles's\r\nwork is journey-work, but it is only fair to note the frequent wealth of\r\nfancy, the occasional felicity of expression, which illustrate this\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\nMore and Beaumont were not, like Quarles, poetical miscellanists and\r\nperiodical writers; but they seem to have shared with him the delusion\r\nthat poetry is an instrument of all work. Henry More, a man well\r\nconnected and who might have risen, but who preferred to pass the greater\r\npart of a long and studious life as a fellow of Christ's College,\r\nCambridge, is best known as a member of the theological school,\r\nindifferently called the Cambridge Platonists and the Cambridge\r\nLatitudinarians. His chief work in verse is a great philosophical poem,\r\nentitled the _Song of the Soul_, with such engaging sub-titles as\r\n_Psychozoia_, _Psychathanasia_, _Antipsychopannychia_, and\r\n_Antimonopsychia_. I shall not, I hope, be suspected of being ignorant of\r\nGreek, or disinclined to metaphysics, if I say that the _Song of the\r\nSoul_ appears to me a venerable mistake. A philosophical controversy\r\ncarried on in this fashion--\r\n\r\n    \"But contradiction, can that have place\r\n    In any soul? Plato affirms ideas;\r\n    But Aristotle, with his pugnacious race,\r\n    As idle figments stiffly them denies,\"\r\n\r\nseems to me to be a signal instance of the wrong thing in the wrong place.\r\nIt is quite true that More has, as Southey says, \"lines and passages of\r\nsublime beauty.\" A man of his time, actuated by its noble thought, trained\r\nas we know More to have been in the severest school of Spenser, and thus\r\nhabituated to the heavenly harmonies of that perfect poet, could hardly\r\nfail to produce such. But his muse is a chaotic not a cosmic one.\r\n\r\nSomething the same may be said of Joseph Beaumont, a friend of Crashaw, and\r\nlike him ejected from Peterhouse, son-in-law of Bishop Wren, and, later,\r\nhead of Jesus College. Beaumont, a strong cavalier and an orthodox\r\nchurchman, was a kind of adversary of More's, whose length and quaintness\r\nhe has exceeded, while he has almost rivalled his learning in _Psyche_ or\r\n_Love's Mystery_, a religious poem of huge dimensions, first published in\r\n1648 and later in 1702. Beaumont, as both fragments of this vast thing and\r\nhis minor poems show, had fancy, taste, and almost genius on opportunity;\r\nbut the prevailing mistake of his school, the idea that poetry is a fit\r\nvehicle for merely prosaic expression, is painfully apparent in him.\r\n\r\nFirst, for various reasons, among the nondescripts of the Caroline school,\r\ndeserves to be mentioned William Habington, a Roman Catholic gentleman of\r\ngood upper middle-class station, whose father was himself a man of letters,\r\nand had some trouble in the Gunpowder Plot. He was born at Hindlip Hall,\r\nnear Worcester, in the year of the plot itself, courted and married Lucy\r\nHerbert, daughter of his neighbour, Lord Powis, and published her charms\r\nand virtues in the collection called _Castara_, first issued in 1634.\r\nHabington also wrote a tragic comedy, _The Queen of Aragon_, and some other\r\nwork, but died in middle life. It is upon _Castara_ that his fame rests. To\r\ntell the truth it is, though, as had been said, an estimable, yet a rather\r\nirritating work. That Habington was a true lover every line of it shows;\r\nthat he had a strong infusion of the abundant poetical inspiration then\r\nabroad is shown by line after line, though hardly by poem after poem, among\r\nits pieces. His series of poems on the death of his friend Talbot is full\r\nof beauty. His religion is sincere, fervent, and often finely expressed;\r\nthough he never rose to Herbert's pure devotion, or to Crashaw's flaming\r\npoetry. One of the later _Castara_ poems may be given:--\r\n\r\n    \"We saw and woo'd each other's eyes,\r\n      My soul contracted then with thine,\r\n    And both burnt in one sacrifice,\r\n      By which our marriage grew divine.\r\n\r\n    \"Let wilder youths, whose soul is sense,\r\n      Profane the temple of delight,\r\n    And purchase endless penitence,\r\n      With the stolen pleasure of one night.\r\n\r\n    \"Time's ever ours, while we despise\r\n      The sensual idol of our clay,\r\n    For though the sun do set and rise,\r\n      We joy one everlasting day.\r\n\r\n    \"Whose light no jealous clouds obscure,\r\n      While each of us shine innocent,\r\n    The troubled stream is still impure;\r\n      With virtue flies away content.\r\n\r\n    \"And though opinions often err,\r\n      We'll court the modest smile of fame,\r\n    For sin's black danger circles her,\r\n      Who hath infection in her name.\r\n\r\n    \"Thus when to one dark silent room\r\n      Death shall our loving coffins thrust:\r\n    Fame will build columns on our tomb,\r\n      And add a perfume to our dust.\"\r\n\r\nBut _Castara_ is a real instance of what some foreign critics very unjustly\r\ncharge on English literature as a whole--a foolish and almost canting\r\nprudery. The poet dins the chastity of his mistress into his readers' heads\r\nuntil the readers in self-defence are driven to say, \"Sir, did any one\r\ndoubt it?\" He protests the freedom of his own passion from any admixture of\r\nfleshly influence, till half a suspicion of hypocrisy and more than half a\r\nfeeling of contempt force themselves on the hearer. A relentless critic\r\nmight connect these unpleasant features with the uncharitable and more than\r\northodox bigotry of his religious poems. Yet Habington, besides\r\ncontributing much agreeable verse to the literature of the period, is\r\ninvaluable as showing the counterside to Milton, the Catholic Puritanism\r\nwhich is no doubt inherent in the English nature, and which, had it not\r\nbeen for the Reformation, would probably have transformed Catholicism in a\r\nvery strange fashion.\r\n\r\nThere is no Puritanism of any kind in a group--it would hardly be fair to\r\ncall them a school--of \"Heroic\" poets to whom very little attention has\r\nbeen paid in histories of literature hitherto, but who lead up not merely\r\nto Davenant's _Gondibert_ and Cowley's _Davideis_, but to _Paradise Lost_\r\nitself. The \"Heroic\" poem was a kind generated partly by the precepts of\r\nthe Italian criticism, including Tasso, partly by the practice of Tasso\r\nhimself, and endeavouring to combine something of the unity of Epic with\r\nsomething and more of the variety of Romance. It may be represented here by\r\nthe work of Chalkhill, Chamberlayne, Marmion, and Kynaston. John Chalkhill,\r\nthe author of _Thealma and Clearchus_, was, with his work, introduced to\r\nthe public in 1683 by Izaak Walton, who styles him \"an acquaintant and\r\nfriend of Edmund Spenser.\" If so, he must have been one of the first of\r\nEnglish poets to adopt the very loose enjambed decasyllabic couplet in\r\nwhich his work, like that of Marmion and still more Chamberlayne, is\r\nwritten. His poem is unfinished, and the construction and working-up of the\r\nstory are looser even than the metre; but it contains a great deal of\r\ncharming description and some very poetical phrase.\r\n\r\nMuch the same may be said of the _Cupid and Psyche_ (1637) of the dramatist\r\nShakerley Marmion (_v. inf._), which follows the original of Apuleius with\r\nalternate closeness and liberty, but is always best when it is most\r\noriginal. The _Leoline and Sydanis_ (1642) of Sir Francis Kynaston is not\r\nin couplets but in rhyme royal--a metre of which the author was so fond\r\nthat he even translated the _Troilus and Cressida_ of Chaucer into Latin,\r\nretaining the seven-line stanza and its rhymes. Kynaston, who was a member\r\nof both universities and at one time proctor at Cambridge, was a man\r\ninterested in various kinds of learning, and even started an Academy or\r\n_Museum Minervae_ of his own. In _Leoline and Sydanis_ he sometimes comes\r\nnear to the mock heroic, but in his lyrics called _Cynthiades_ he comes\r\nnearer still to the best Caroline cry. One or two of his pieces have found\r\ntheir way into anthologies, but until the present writer reprinted his\r\nworks[60] he was almost unknown.\r\n\r\n[60] In _Minor Caroline Poets_, vols. i. and ii. (Oxford, 1905-6). An\r\nimportant addition to the religious verse of the time was made by Mr.\r\nDobell with the _Poems_ (London, 1903) of Thomas Traherne, a follower of\r\nHerbert, with some strange anticipations of Blake.\r\n\r\nThe most important by far, however, of this group is William Chamberlayne,\r\na physician of Shaftesbury, who, before or during the Civil War, began and\r\nafterwards finished (publishing it in 1659) the very long heroic romance of\r\n_Pharonnida_, a story of the most involved and confused character but with\r\nepisodes of great vividness and even sustained power: a piece of\r\nversification straining the liberties of _enjambement_ in line and want of\r\nconnection in syntax to the utmost; but a very mine of poetical expression\r\nand imagery. Jewels are to be picked up on every page by those who will\r\ntake the trouble to do so, and who are not offended by the extraordinary\r\nnonchalance of the composition.\r\n\r\nThe _Theophila_ of Edward Benlowes (1603?-1676) was printed in 1652 with\r\nelaborate and numerous engravings by Hollar, which have made it rare, and\r\nusually imperfect when met with. Benlowes was a Cambridge man (of St.\r\nJohn's College) by education, but lived latterly and died at Oxford, having\r\nbeen reduced from wealth to poverty by the liberality which made his\r\nfriends anagrammatise his name into \"Benevolus.\" His work was abused as an\r\nawful example of the extravagant style by Butler (_Character of a Small\r\nPoet_), and by Warburton in the next century; but it was never reprinted\r\ntill the date of the collection just noted. It is a really curious book,\r\ndisplaying the extraordinary _diffusion_ of poetical spirit still existing,\r\nbut in a hectic and decadent condition. Benlowes--a Cleveland with more\r\npoetry and less cleverness, or a very much weaker Crashaw--uses a\r\nmonorhymed triplet made up of a heroic, an octosyllable, and an Alexandrine\r\nwhich is as wilfully odd as the rest of him.\r\n\r\nRandolph, the youngest and not the least gifted of the tribe of Ben, died\r\nbefore he was thirty, after writing some noteworthy plays, and a certain\r\nnumber of minor poems, which, as it has been well observed, rather show\r\nthat he might have done anything, than that he did actually do something.\r\nCorbet was Bishop first of Oxford and then of Norwich, and died in 1635.\r\nCorbet's work is of that peculiar class which is usually, though not\r\nalways, due to \"University Wits,\" and which only appeals to people with a\r\nconsiderable appreciation of humour, and a large stock of general\r\ninformation. It is always occasional in character, and rarely succeeds so\r\nwell as when the treatment is one of distinct _persiflage_. Thus the elegy\r\non Donne is infinitely inferior to Carew's, and the mortuary epitaph on\r\nArabella Stuart is, for such a subject and from the pen of a man of great\r\ntalent, extraordinarily feeble. The burlesque epistle to Lord Mordaunt on\r\nhis journey to the North is great fun, and the \"Journey into France,\"\r\nthough, to borrow one of its own jokes, rather \"strong,\" is as good. The\r\n\"Exhortation to Mr. John Hammond,\" a ferocious satire on the Puritans,\r\ndistinguishes itself from almost all precedent work of the kind by the\r\nforce and directness of its attack, which almost anticipates Dryden. And\r\nCorbet had both pathetic and imaginative touches on occasion, as here:--\r\n\r\n    \"What I shall leave thee none can tell,\r\n    But all shall say I wish thee well,\r\n    I wish thee, Vin, before all wealth,\r\n    Both bodily and ghostly health;\r\n    Nor too much wealth, nor wit, come to thee,\r\n    So much of either may undo thee.\r\n    I wish thee learning, not for show,\r\n    Enough for to instruct and know;\r\n    Not such as gentlemen require\r\n    To prate at table, or at fire.\r\n    I wish thee all thy mother's graces,\r\n    Thy father's fortunes, and his places.\r\n    I wish thee friends, and one at court,\r\n    Not to build on, but support\r\n    To keep thee, not in doing many\r\n    Oppressions, but from suffering any.\r\n    I wish thee peace in all thy ways,\r\n    Nor lazy nor contentious days;\r\n    And when thy soul and body part\r\n    As innocent as now those art.\"\r\n\r\nCartwright, a short-lived man but a hard student, shows best in his dramas.\r\nIn his occasional poems, strongly influenced by Donne, he is best at\r\npanegyric, worst at burlesque and epigram. In \"On a Gentlewoman's Silk\r\nHood\" and some other pieces he may challenge comparison with the most\r\nfutile of the metaphysicals; but no one who has read his noble elegy on Sir\r\nBevil Grenvil, unequal as it is, will think lightly of Cartwright. Sir\r\nEdward Sherburne was chiefly a translator in the fashionable style. His\r\noriginal poems were those of a very inferior Carew (he even copies the name\r\nCelia), but they are often pretty. Alexander Brome, of whom very little is\r\nknown, and who must not be confounded with the dramatist, was a lawyer and\r\na cavalier song-writer, who too frequently wrote mere doggerel; but on the\r\nother hand, he sometimes did not, and when he escaped the evil influence,\r\nas in the stanzas \"Come, come, let us drink,\" \"The Trooper,\" and not a few\r\nothers, he has the right anacreontic vein.\r\n\r\nAs for Charles Cotton, his \"Virgil Travesty\" is deader than Scarron's, and\r\ndeserves to be so. The famous lines which Lamb has made known to every one\r\nin the essay on \"New Year's Day\" are the best thing he did. But there are\r\nmany excellent things scattered about his work, despite a strong taint of\r\nthe mere coarseness and nastiness which have been spoken of. And though he\r\nwas also much tainted with the hopeless indifference to prosody which\r\ndistinguished all these belated cavaliers, it is noteworthy that he was one\r\nof the few Englishmen for centuries to adopt the strict French forms and\r\nwrite rondeaux and the like. On the whole his poetical power has been a\r\nlittle undervalued, while he was also dexterous in prose.\r\n\r\nThomas Stanley has been classed above as a translator because he would\r\nprobably have liked to have his scholarship thus brought into prominence.\r\nIt was, both in ancient and modern tongues, very considerable. His\r\n_History of Philosophy_ was a classic for a very long time; and his edition\r\nof AEschylus had the honour of revision within the nineteenth century by\r\nPorson and by Butler. It is not certain that Bentley did not borrow from\r\nhim; and his versions of Anacreon, of various other Greek lyrists, of the\r\nlater Latins, and of modern writers in Spanish and Italian are most\r\nremarkable. But he was also an original poet in the best Caroline style of\r\nlyric; and his combination of family (for he was of the great Stanley\r\nstock), learning, and genius gave him a high position with men of letters\r\nof his day. Sidney Godolphin, who died very young fighting for the King in\r\nHopton's army, had no time to do much; but he has been magnificently\r\ncelebrated by no less authorities than Clarendon and Hobbes, and fragments\r\nof his work, which has only recently been collected, have long been known.\r\nNone of it, except a commendatory poem or two, was printed in his own time,\r\nand very little later; while the MSS. are not in very accomplished form,\r\nand show few or no signs of revision by the author. Some, however, of\r\nGodolphin's lyrics are of great beauty, and a couplet translation of the\r\n_Fourth AEneid_ has as much firmness as Sandys or Waller. Another precocious\r\npoet whose life also was cut short, though less heroically, and on the\r\nother side of politics, was John Hall, a Cambridge man, who at barely\r\ntwenty (1645-6) issued a volume of poems and another, _Horae Vacivae_, of\r\nprose essays, translated Longinus, did hack-work on the Cromwellian side,\r\nand died, it is said, of loose and lazy living. Hall's poems are of mixed\r\nkinds--sacred and profane, serious and comic--and the best of them, such as\r\n\"The Call\" and \"The Lure,\" have a slender but most attractive vein of\r\nfantastic charm. Patrick Carey, again, a Royalist and brother of the famous\r\nLord Falkland, brought up as a Roman Catholic but afterwards a convert to\r\nthe Church of England, left manuscript pieces, human and divine, which were\r\nprinted by Sir Walter Scott in 1819, and are extremely pleasant; while\r\nBishop King, though not often at the height of his well-known \"Tell me no\r\nmore how fair she is,\" never falls below a level much above the average.\r\nThe satirist John Cleveland, whose poems were extremely popular and exist\r\nin numerous editions (much blended with other men's work and hard to\r\ndisentangle), was made a sort of \"metaphysical helot\" by a reference in\r\nDryden's _Essay of Dramatic Poesy_ and quotations in Johnson's _Life of\r\nCowley_. He partly deserves this, though he has real originality of thought\r\nand phrase; but much of his work is political or occasional, and he does\r\nnot often rise to the quintessential exquisiteness of some of those who\r\nhave been mentioned. A few examples of this class may be given:--\r\n\r\n                                    \"Through a low\r\n    Dark vale, where shade-affecting walks did grow\r\n    Eternal strangers to the sun, did lie\r\n    The narrow path frequented only by\r\n    The forest tyrants when they bore their prey\r\n    From open dangers of discovering day.\r\n    Passed through this desert valley, they were now\r\n    Climbing an easy hill, whose every bough\r\n    Maintained a feathered chorister to sing\r\n    Soft panegyrics, and the rude winds bring\r\n    Into a murmuring slumber; whilst the calm\r\n    Morn on each leaf did hang the liquid balm\r\n    With an intent, before the next sun's birth\r\n    To drop it in those wounds which the cleft earth\r\n    Received from's last day's beams. The hill's ascent\r\n    Wound up by action, in a large extent\r\n    Of leafy plains, shows them the canopy\r\n    Beneath whose shadow their large way did lie.\"\r\n\r\n                    CHAMBERLAYNE, _Pharonnida_, iv. 1. 199-216.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that of these eighteen lines all but _four_ are\r\noverrun; and the resemblance to the couplet of Keats's _Endymion_ should\r\nnot be missed.\r\n\r\n    \"April is past, then do not shed,\r\n      And do not waste in vain,\r\n    Upon thy mother's earthy bed\r\n      Thy tears of silver rain.\r\n\r\n    \"Thou canst not hope that the cold earth\r\n      By wat'ring will bring forth\r\n    A flower like thee, or will give birth\r\n      To one of the like worth.\r\n\r\n    \"'Tis true the rain fall'n from the sky\r\n      Or from the clouded air,\r\n    Doth make the earth to fructify,\r\n      Ann makes the heaven more fair.\r\n\r\n    \"With thy dear face it is not so,\r\n      Which, if once overcast,\r\n    If thou rain down thy showers of woe,\r\n      They, like the sirens, blast.\r\n\r\n    \"Therefore, when sorrow shall becloud\r\n      Thy fair serenest day,\r\n    Weep not: thy sighs shall be allow'd\r\n      To chase the storm away.\r\n\r\n    \"Consider that the teeming vine,\r\n      If cut by chance [it] weep,\r\n    Doth bear no grapes to make the wine,\r\n      But feels eternal sleep.\"\r\n\r\n                    KYNASTON.\r\n\r\n      \"Be conquer'd by such charms; there shall\r\n          Not always such enticements fall.\r\n    What know we whether that rich spring of light\r\n          Will staunch his streams\r\n          Of golden beams\r\n      Ere the approach of night?\r\n\r\n      \"How know we whether't shall not be\r\n          The last to either thee or me?\r\n    He can at will his ancient brightness gain,\r\n          But thou and I\r\n          When we shall die\r\n      Shall still in dust remain.\"\r\n\r\n                    JOHN HALL.\r\n\r\nThis group of poets seems to demand a little general criticism. They stand\r\nmore by themselves than almost any other group in English literary history,\r\nmarked off in most cases with equal sharpness from predecessors, followers,\r\nand contemporaries. The best of them, Herrick and Carew, with Crashaw as a\r\ngreat thirdsman, called themselves \"sons\" of Ben Jonson, and so in a way\r\nthey were; but they were even more sons of Donne. That great writer's\r\nburning passion, his strange and labyrinthine conceits, the union in him of\r\nspiritual and sensual fire, influenced the idiosyncrasies of each as hardly\r\nany other writer's influence has done in other times; while his technical\r\nshortcomings had unquestionably a fatal effect on the weaker members of the\r\nschool. But there is also noticeable in them a separate and hardly\r\ndefinable influence which circumscribes their class even more distinctly.\r\nThey were, as I take it, the last set of poets anywhere in Europe to\r\nexhibit, in that most fertile department of poetry which seeks its\r\ninspiration in the love of man for woman, the frank expression of physical\r\naffection united with the spirit of chivalry, tempered by the consciousness\r\nof the fading of all natural delights, and foreshadowed by that\r\nintellectual introspection which has since developed itself in such great\r\nmeasure--some think out of all measure--in poetry. In the best of them\r\nthere is no cynicism at all. Herrick and Carew are only sorry that the\r\namatory fashion of this world passeth; they do not in the least undervalue\r\nit while it lasts, or sneer at it when it is gone. There is, at least to my\r\nthinking, little coarseness in them (I must perpetually except Herrick's\r\nepigrams), though there is, according to modern standards, a great deal of\r\nvery plain speaking. They have as much frank enjoyment of physical\r\npleasures as any classic or any mediaevalist; but they have what no classic\r\nexcept Catullus and perhaps Sappho had,--the fine rapture, the passing but\r\ntransforming madness which brings merely physical passion _sub specie\r\naeternitatis_; and they have in addition a faint preliminary touch of that\r\nanalytic and self-questioning spirit which refines even further upon the\r\nchivalric rapture and the classical-renaissance mysticism of the shadow of\r\ndeath, but which since their time has eaten up the simpler and franker\r\nmoods of passion itself. With them, as a necessary consequence, the\r\nphysical is (to anticipate a famous word of which more presently) always\r\nblended with the metaphysical. It is curious that, as one result of the\r\nchange of manner, this should have even been made a reproach to them--that\r\nthe ecstasy of their ecstasies should apparently have become not an excuse\r\nbut an additional crime. Yet if any grave and precise person will read\r\nCarew's _Rapture_, the most audacious, and of course wilfully audacious\r\nexpression of the style, and then turn to the archangel's colloquy with\r\nAdam in _Paradise Lost_, I should like to ask him on which side, according\r\nto his honour and conscience, the coarseness lies. I have myself no\r\nhesitation in saying that it lies with the husband of Mary Powell and the\r\nauthor of _Tetrachordon_, not with the lover of Celia and the author of the\r\nlines to \"A. L.\"\r\n\r\nThere are other matters to be considered in the determination of the\r\ncritical fortunes of the Caroline school. Those fortunes have been rather\r\nodd. Confounded at first in the general oblivion which the Restoration\r\nthrew on all works of \"the last age,\" and which deepened as the school of\r\nDryden passed into the school of Pope, the writers of the Donne-Cowley\r\ntradition were first exhumed for the purposes of _post-mortem_ examination\r\nby and in the remarkable \"Life\" of Johnson, devoted to the last member of\r\nthe class. It is at this time of day alike useless to defend the\r\nMetaphysical Poets against much that Johnson said, and to defend Johnson\r\nagainst the charge of confusion, inadequacy, and haste in his\r\ngeneralisations. The term metaphysical, originating with Dryden, and used\r\nby Johnson with a slight difference, may be easily miscomprehended by any\r\none who chooses to forget its legitimate application both etymologically\r\nand by usage to that which comes, as it were, behind or after nature. Still\r\nJohnson undoubtedly confounded in one common condemnation writers who have\r\nvery little in common, and (which was worse) criticised a peculiarity of\r\nexpression as if it had been a deliberate substitution of alloy for gold.\r\nThe best phrases of the metaphysical poets more than justify themselves to\r\nany one who looks at poetry with a more catholic appreciation than\r\nJohnson's training and associations enabled him to apply; and even the\r\nworst are but mistaken attempts to follow out a very sound principle, that\r\nof \"making the common as though it were not common.\" Towards the end of the\r\neighteenth century some of these poets, especially Herrick, were revived\r\nwith taste and success by Headley and other men of letters. But it so\r\nhappened that the three great critics of the later Romantic revival,\r\nHazlitt, Lamb, and Coleridge, were all strongly attracted to the bolder and\r\nmore irregular graces of the great dramatic poets, to the not less quaint\r\nbut less \"mignardised\" quaintnesses of prose writers like Burton, Browne,\r\nand Taylor, or to the massive splendours of the Elizabethan poets proper.\r\nThe poetry of the Caroline age was, therefore, a little slurred, and this\r\nmishap of falling between two schools has constantly recurred to it. Some\r\ncritics even who have done its separate authors justice, have subsequently\r\nindulged in palinodes, have talked about decadence and Alexandrianism and\r\nwhat not. The majority have simply let the Cavalier Poets (as they are\r\nsometimes termed by a mere historical coincidence) be something more than\r\nthe victims of the schools that preceded and followed them. The lovers of\r\nthe school of good sense which Waller founded regard the poets of this\r\nchapter as extravagant concettists; the lovers of the Elizabethan school\r\nproper regard them as effeminate triflers. One of Milton's gorgeous but\r\nconstantly illogical phrases about the poets of his day may perhaps have\r\ncreated a prejudice against these poets. But Milton was a politician as\r\nwell as a poet, a fanatic as well as a man of letters of seldom equalled,\r\nand never, save in two or three cases, surpassed powers. He was also a man\r\nof a more morose and unamiable private character than any other great poet\r\nthe world has known except Racine. The easy _bonhomie_ of the Caroline muse\r\nrepelled his austerity; its careless good-breeding shocked his middle-class\r\nand Puritan Philistinism; its laxity revolted his principles of morality.\r\nNot improbably the vein of sympathy which discovers itself in the exquisite\r\nverse of the _Comus_, of the _Allegro_ and _Penseroso_, of _Lycidas_\r\nitself, infuriated him (as such veins of sympathy when they are rudely\r\nchecked and turned from their course will often do) with those who indulged\r\ninstead of checking it. But because _Lycidas_ is magnificent, and _Il\r\nPenseroso_ charming poetry, we are not to think meanly of \"Fair\r\nDaffodils,\" or \"Ask me no more,\" of \"Going to the Wars,\" or \"Tell me no\r\nmore how fair she is.\"\r\n\r\nLet us clear our minds of this cant, and once more admit, as the student of\r\nliterature always has to remind himself, that a sapphire and diamond ring\r\nis not less beautiful because it is not a marble palace, or a bank of wild\r\nflowers in a wood because it is not a garden after the fashion of Lenotre.\r\nIn the division of English poetry which we have been reviewing, there are\r\nto be found some of the most exquisite examples of the gem and flower order\r\nof beauty that can be found in all literature. When Herrick bids Perilla\r\n\r\n                          \"Wind me in that very sheet\r\n    Which wrapt thy smooth limbs when thou didst implore\r\n    The gods' protection but the night before:\r\n    Follow me weeping to my turf, and there\r\n    Let fall a primrose and with it a tear;\r\n    Then lastly, let some weekly strewings be\r\n    Devoted to the memory of me.\r\n    _Then shall my ghost not walk about; but keep_\r\n    _Still in the cool and silent shades of sleep;_\"\r\n\r\nor when he writes that astonishing verse, so unlike his usual style--\r\n\r\n    \"In this world, _the Isle of Dreams_,\r\n    While we sit by sorrow's streams,\r\n    Tears and terrors are our themes;\"\r\n\r\nwhen Carew, in one of those miraculous closing bursts, carefully led up to,\r\nof which he has almost the secret, cries\r\n\r\n    \"_Oh, love me then, and now begin it,_\r\n    _Let us not lose this present minute;_\r\n    _For time and age will work that wrack_\r\n    _Which time nor age shall ne'er call back;_\"\r\n\r\nwhen even the sober blood in Habington's decent veins spurts in this\r\nsplendid sally--\r\n\r\n    \"So, 'mid the ice of the far northern sea,\r\n    A star about the Arctic circle may\r\n    Than ours yield clearer light; _yet that but shall_\r\n    _Serve at the frozen pilot's funeral_:\"\r\n\r\nwhen Crashaw writes as if caught by the very fire of which he speaks,--the\r\nfire of the flaming heart of Saint Theresa; when Lovelace, most careless\r\nand unliterary of all men, breaks out as if by simple instinct into those\r\nperfect verses which hardly even Burns and Shelley have equalled since,--it\r\nis impossible for any one who feels for poetry at all not to feel more than\r\nappreciation, not to feel sheer enthusiasm. Putting aside the very greatest\r\npoets of all, I hardly know any group of poetical workers who so often\r\ncause this enthusiasm as our present group, with their wonderful felicity\r\nof language; with their command of those lyrical measures which seem so\r\neasy and are so difficult; with their almost unparalleled blend of a\r\nsensuousness that does not make the intellect sluggish and of the loftiest\r\nspirituality.\r\n\r\nWhen we examine what is said against them, a great deal of it is found to\r\nbe based on that most treacherous of all foundations, a hard-driven\r\nmetaphor. Because they come at the end of a long and fertile period of\r\nliterature, because a colder and harder kind of poetry followed them, they\r\nare said to be \"decadence,\" \"autumn,\" \"over-ripe fruit,\" \"sunset,\" and so\r\nforth. These pretty analogies have done much harm in literary history. Of\r\nthe Muse it is most strictly and soberly true that \"Bocca bacciata non\r\nperde ventura, anzi rinuova come fa la luna.\" If there is any meaning about\r\nthe phrases of decadence, autumn, and the like, it is derived from the idea\r\nof approaching death and cessation. There is no death, no cessation, in\r\nliterature; and the sadness and decay of certain periods is mere fiction.\r\nAn autumn day would not be sad if the average human being did not (very\r\nproperly) take from it a warning of the shortness of his own life. But\r\nliterature is not short-lived. There was no sign of poetry dying when\r\nShelley lived two thousand five hundred years after Sappho, when Shakespere\r\nlived as long after Homer. Periods like the periods of the Greek Anthology\r\nor of our Caroline poetry are not periods of decay, but simply periods of\r\ndifference. There are no periods of decay in literature so long as anything\r\ngood is produced; and when nothing good is produced, it is only a sign\r\nthat the field is taking a healthy turn of fallow. In this time much that\r\nwas good, with a quite wonderful and charming goodness, was produced. What\r\nis more, it was a goodness which had its own distinct characteristics, some\r\nof which I have endeavoured to point out, and which the true lover of\r\npoetry would be as unwilling to lose as to lose the other goodnesses of all\r\nthe great periods, and of all but the greatest names in those periods. For\r\nthe unapproachables, for the first Three, for Homer, for Shakespere, for\r\nDante, I would myself (though I should be very sorry) give up all the poets\r\nwe have been reviewing. I should not like to have to choose between Herrick\r\nand Milton's earlier poems; between the Caroline poets, major and minor, as\r\njust reviewed on the one hand, and _The Faerie Queene_ on the other. But I\r\ncertainly would give _Paradise Regained_ for some score of poems of the\r\nwriters just named; and for them altogether I would give all but a few\r\npassages (I would not give those) of _Paradise Lost_. And, as I have\r\nendeavoured (perhaps to my readers' satiety) to point out, this comparative\r\nestimate is after all a radically unsound one. We are not called upon to\r\nweigh this kind of poetry against that kind; we are only incidentally, and\r\nin an uninvidious manner, called upon to weigh this poet against that even\r\nof the same kind. The whole question is, whether each is good in his own\r\nkind, and whether the kind is a worthy and delightful one. And in regard of\r\nmost of the poets just surveyed, both these questions can be answered with\r\nan unhesitating affirmative. If we had not these poets, one particular\r\nsavour, one particular form, of the poetical rapture would be lacking to\r\nthe poetical expert; just as if what Herrick himself calls \"the brave\r\nBurgundian wine\" were not, no amount of claret and champagne could replace\r\nit. For passionate sense of the good things of earth, and at the same time\r\nfor mystical feeling of their insecurity, for exquisite style without the\r\nfrigidity and the over-correctness which the more deliberate stylists\r\nfrequently display, for a blending of Nature and art that seems as if it\r\nmust have been as simply instinctive in all as it certainly was in some,\r\nthe poets of the Tribe of Ben, of the Tribe of Donne, who illustrated the\r\nperiod before Puritanism and Republicanism combined had changed England\r\nfrom merriment to sadness, stand alone in letters. We have had as good\r\nsince, but never the same--never any such blending of classical frankness,\r\nof mediaeval simplicity and chivalry, of modern reflection and thought.[61]\r\n\r\n[61] Since this book first appeared, some persons whose judgment I respect\r\nhave expressed to me surprise and regret that I have not given a higher and\r\nlarger place to Henry Vaughan. A higher I cannot give, because I think him,\r\ndespite the extreme beauty of his thought and (more rarely) of his\r\nexpression, a most imperfect poet; nor a larger, because that would involve\r\na critical arguing out of the matter, which would be unsuitable to the plan\r\nand scale of this book. Had he oftener written as he wrote in the famous\r\npoem referred to in the text, or as in the magnificent opening of \"The\r\nWorld\"--\r\n\r\n    \"I saw Eternity the other night,\r\n    _Like a great ring of pure and endless light_,\r\n        All calm as it was bright,\"\r\n\r\nthere would be much more to say of him. But he is not master of the\r\nexpression suitable to his noble and precious thought except in the\r\nbriefest bursts--bursts compared to which even Crashaw's are sustained and\r\nmethodical. His admirers claim for \"The Retreat\" the germ of Wordsworth's\r\ngreat ode, but if any one will compare the two he will hardly complain that\r\nVaughan has too little space here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTH DRAMATIC PERIOD\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo great names remain to be noticed in the Elizabethan drama (though\r\nneither produced a play till after Elizabeth was dead), some interesting\r\nplaywrights of third or fourth-rate importance have to be added to them,\r\nand in a postscript we shall have to gather up the minor or anonymous work,\r\nsome of it of very high excellence, of the second division of our whole\r\nsubject, including plays of the second, third, and fourth periods. But with\r\nthis fourth period we enter into what may really be called by comparison\r\n(remembering always what has been said in the last chapter) a period of\r\ndecadence, and at its latter end it becomes very decadent indeed. Only in\r\nFord perhaps, of our named and individual authors in this chapter, and in\r\nhim very rarely, occur the flashes of sheer poetry which, as we have seen\r\nin each of the three earlier chapters on the drama, lighten the work of the\r\nElizabethan and Jacobean dramatists proper with extraordinary and lavish\r\nbrilliance. Not even in Ford are to be found the whole and perfect studies\r\nof creative character which, even leaving Shakespere out of the question,\r\nare to be found earlier in plays and playwrights of all kinds and\r\nstrengths, from _The Maid's Tragedy_ and _Vittoria Corombona_, to _The\r\nMerry Devil of Edmonton_ and _A Cure for a Cuckold_. The tragedies have Ben\r\nJonson's labour without his force, the comedies his coarseness and lack of\r\ninspiriting life without his keen observation and incisive touch. As the\r\ntaste indeed turned more and more from tragedy to comedy, we get attempts\r\non the part of playwrights to win it back by a return to the bloody and\r\nmonstrous conceptions of an earlier time, treated, however, without the\r\nredeeming features of that time, though with a little more coherence and\r\nart. Massinger's _Unnatural Combat_, and Ford's _'Tis Pity She's a Whore_,\r\namong great plays, are examples of this: the numerous minor examples are\r\nhardly worth mentioning. But the most curious symptom of all was the\r\ngradual and, as it were, imperceptible loss of the secret of blank verse\r\nitself, which had been the instrument of the great triumphs of the stage\r\nfrom Marlowe to Dekker. Something of this loss of grasp may have been\r\nnoticed in the looseness of Fletcher and the over-stiffness of Jonson: it\r\nis perceptible distinctly even in Ford and Massinger. But as the\r\nRestoration, or rather the silencing of the theatres by the Commonwealth\r\napproaches, it becomes more and more evident until we reach the chaotic and\r\nhideous jumble of downright prose and verse that is neither prose nor\r\nverse, noticeable even in the early plays of Dryden, and chargeable no\r\ndoubt with the twenty years' return of the English drama to the comparative\r\nbarbarism of the couplet. This apparent loss of ear and rhythm-sense has\r\nbeen commented on already in reference to Lovelace, Suckling (himself a\r\ndramatist), and others of the minor Caroline poets; but it is far more\r\nnoticeable in drama, and resulted in the production, by some of the\r\nplaywrights of the transition period under Charles I. and Charles II., of\r\nsome of the most amorphous botches in the way of style that disfigure\r\nEnglish literature.\r\n\r\nWith the earliest and best work of Philip Massinger, however, we are at any\r\nrate chronologically still at a distance from the lamentable close of a\r\ngreat period. He was born in 1583, being the son of Arthur Massinger, a\r\n\"servant\" (pretty certainly in the gentle sense of service) to the Pembroke\r\nfamily. In 1602 he was entered at St. Alban's Hall in Oxford: he is\r\nsupposed to have left the university about 1609, and may have begun writing\r\nplays soon. But the first definite notice of his occupation or indeed of\r\nhis life that we have is his participation (about 1614) with Daborne and\r\nField in a begging letter to the well-known manager Henslowe for an advance\r\nof five pounds on \"the new play,\" nor was anything of his printed or\r\npositively known to be acted till 1622, the date of _The Virgin Martyr_.\r\nFrom that time onwards he appears frequently as an author, though many of\r\nhis plays were not printed till after his death in 1640. But nothing is\r\nknown of his life. He was buried on 18th March in St. Saviour's, Southwark,\r\nbeing designated as a \"stranger,\"--that is to say, not a parishioner.\r\n\r\nThirty-seven plays in all, or thirty-eight if we add Mr. Bullen's\r\nconjectural discovery, _Sir John Barneveldt_, are attributed to Massinger;\r\nbut of these many have perished, Massinger having somehow been specially\r\nobnoxious to the ravages of Warburton's cook. Eighteen survive; twelve of\r\nwhich were printed during the author's life. Massinger was thus an\r\nindustrious and voluminous author, one of many points which make Professor\r\nMinto's comparison of him to Gray a little surprising. He was, both at\r\nfirst and later, much given to collaboration,--indeed, there is a theory,\r\nnot without colour from contemporary rumour, that he had nearly if not\r\nquite as much to do as Beaumont with Fletcher's great work. But oddly\r\nenough the plays which he is known to have written alone do not, as in\r\nother cases, supply a very sure test of what is his share in those which he\r\nwrote conjointly. _The Old Law_, a singular play founded on a similar\r\nconception to that in the late Mr. Anthony Trollope's _Fixed Period_, is\r\nattributed also to Rowley and Dekker, and has sometimes been thought to be\r\nso early that Massinger, except as a mere boy, could have had no hand in\r\nit. The contradictions of critics over _The Virgin Martyr_ (by Massinger\r\nand Dekker) have been complete; some peremptorily handing over all the fine\r\nscenes to one, and some declaring that these very scenes could only be\r\nwritten by the other. It is pretty certain that the argumentative\r\ntheological part is Massinger's; for he had a strong liking for such\r\nthings, while the passages between Dorothea and her servant Angelo are at\r\nonce more delicate than most of his work, and more regular and even than\r\nDekker's. No companion is, however, assigned to him in _The Unnatural\r\nCombat_, which is probably a pretty early and certainly a characteristic\r\nexample of his style. His demerits appear in the exaggerated and crude\r\ndevilry of the wicked hero, old Malefort (who cheats his friend, makes away\r\nwith his wife, kills his son in single combat, and conceives an incestuous\r\npassion for his daughter), in the jerky alternation and improbable conduct\r\nof the plot, and in the merely extraneous connection of the farcical\r\nscenes. His merits appear in the stately versification and ethical interest\r\nof the debate which precedes the unnatural duel, and in the spirited and\r\nwell-told apologue (for it is almost that) of the needy soldier, Belgarde,\r\nwho is bidden not to appear at the governor's table in his shabby clothes,\r\nand makes his appearance in full armour. The debate between father and son\r\nmay be given:--\r\n\r\n    _Malef. sen._ \"Now we are alone, sir;\r\n                  And thou hast liberty to unload the burthen\r\n                  Which thou groan'st under. Speak thy griefs.\r\n\r\n    _Malef. jun._ I shall, sir;\r\n                  But in a perplex'd form and method, which\r\n                  You only can interpret: Would you had not\r\n                  A guilty knowledge in your bosom, of\r\n                  The language which you force me to deliver\r\n                  So I were nothing!

But the\r\nirrationality of the _donnee_ (Sforza the duke charges his favourite not to\r\nlet the duchess survive his own death, and the abuse of the authority thus\r\ngiven leads to horrible injustice and the death of both duchess and duke)\r\nmars the whole. The predilection of the author for sudden turns and twists\r\nof situation, his neglect to make his plots and characters acceptable and\r\nconceivable as wholes, appear indeed everywhere, even in what I have no\r\ndoubt in calling his real masterpiece by far, the fine tragi-comedy of _A\r\nNew Way to Pay Old Debts_. The revengeful trick by which a satellite of the\r\ngreat extortioner, Sir Giles Overreach, brings about his employer's\r\ndiscomfiture, regardless of his own ruin, is very like the denouement of\r\nthe Brass and Quilp part of the _Old Curiosity Shop_, may have suggested it\r\n(for _A New Way to Pay Old Debts_ lasted as an acting play well into\r\nDickens's time), and, like it, is a little improbable. But the play is an\r\nadmirable one, and Overreach (who, as is well known, was supposed to be a\r\nkind of study of his half namesake, Mompesson, the notorious monopolist) is\r\nby far the best single character that Massinger ever drew. He again came\r\nclose to true comedy in _The City Madam_, another of the best known of his\r\nplays, where the trick adopted at once to expose the villainy of the\r\napparently reformed spendthrift Luke, and to abate the ruinous extravagance\r\nof Lady Frugal and her daughters, is perhaps not beyond the limits of at\r\nleast dramatic verisimilitude, and gives occasion to some capital scenes.\r\n_The Bondman_, _The Renegado_, the curious _Parliament of Love_, which,\r\nlike others of Massinger's plays, is in an almost AEschylean state of\r\ntext-corruptness, _The Great Duke of Florence_, _The Maid of Honour_ (one\r\nof the very doubtful evidences of Massinger's supposed conversion to Roman\r\nCatholicism), _The Picture_ (containing excellent passages, but for\r\nimprobability and topsy-turviness of incident ranking with _The Duke of\r\nMilan_), _The Emperor of the East_, _The Guardian_, _A Very Woman_, _The\r\nBashful Lover_, are all plays on which, if there were space, it would be\r\ninteresting to comment; and they all display their author's strangely mixed\r\nmerits and defects. _The Roman Actor_ and _The Fatal Dowry_ must have a\r\nlittle more attention. The first is, I think, Massinger's best tragic\r\neffort; and the scene where Domitian murders Paris, with his tyrannical\r\nexplanation of the deed, shows a greater conception of tragic poetry--a\r\nlittle cold and stately, a little Racinish or at least Cornelian rather\r\nthan Shakesperian, but still passionate and worthy of the tragic\r\nstage--than anything that Massinger has done. _The Fatal Dowry_, written in\r\nconcert with Field and unceremoniously pillaged by Rowe in his once famous\r\n_Fair Penitent_, is a purely romantic tragedy, injured by the unattractive\r\ncharacter of the light-of-love Beaumelle before her repentance (Massinger\r\nnever could draw a woman), and by not a few of the author's favourite\r\nimprobabilities and glaring or rather startling non-sequiturs of action,\r\nbut full also of fine passages, especially of the quasi-forensic kind in\r\nwhich Massinger so much delights.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, it may seem inconsistent that, after allowing so many faults in\r\nMassinger, I should protest against the rather low estimate of him which\r\ncritics from Lamb downwards have generally given. Yet I do so protest. It\r\nis true that he has not the highest flashes either of verbal poetry or of\r\ndramatic character-drawing; and though Hartley Coleridge's dictum that he\r\nhad no humour has been exclaimed against, it is only verbally wrong. It is\r\nalso true that in him perhaps for the first time we perceive, what is sure\r\nto appear towards the close of a period, a distinct touch of _literary_\r\nborrowing--evidence of knowledge and following of his forerunners. Yet he\r\nhad a high, a varied, and a fertile imagination. He had, and was the last\r\nto have, an extensive and versatile command of blank verse, never perhaps\r\nreaching the most perfect mastery of Marlowe or of Shakespere, but\r\nsingularly free from monotony, and often both harmonious and dignified. He\r\ncould deal, and deal well, with a large range of subjects; and if he never\r\nascends to the height of a De Flores or a Bellafront, he never descends to\r\nthe depths in which both Middleton and Dekker too often complacently\r\nwallow. Unless we are to count by mere flashes, he must, I think, rank\r\nafter Shakespere, Fletcher, and Jonson among his fellows; and this I say,\r\nhonestly avowing that I have nothing like the enthusiasm for him that I\r\nhave for Webster, or for Dekker, or for Middleton. We may no doubt allow\r\ntoo much for bulk of work, for sustained excellence at a certain level, and\r\nfor general competence as against momentary excellence. But we may also\r\nallow far too little; and this has perhaps been the general tendency of\r\nlater criticism in regard to Massinger. It is unfortunate that he never\r\nsucceeded in making as perfect a single expression of his tragic ability as\r\nhe did of his comic, for the former was, I incline to think, the higher of\r\nthe two. But many of his plays are lost, and many of those which remain\r\ncome near to such excellence. It is by no means impossible that Massinger\r\nmay have lost incomparably by the misdeeds of the constantly execrated, but\r\nnever to be execrated enough, minion of that careless herald.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of Clarendon, almost absolutely contradictory opinions have\r\nbeen delivered, by critics of great authority, about John Ford. In one of\r\nthe most famous outbursts of his generous and enthusiastic estimate of the\r\nElizabethan period, Lamb has pronounced Ford to be of the first order of\r\npoets. Mr Swinburne, while bringing not a few limitations to this\r\ntremendous eulogy, has on the whole supported it in one of the most\r\nbrilliant of his prose essays; and critics as a rule have bowed to Lamb's\r\nverdict. On the other hand, Hazlitt (who is \"gey ill to differ with\" when\r\nthere are, as here, no extra-literary considerations to reckon) has\r\ntraversed that verdict in one of the most damaging utterances of\r\ncommonsense, yet not commonplace, criticism anywhere to be found, asking\r\nbluntly and pointedly whether the exceptionableness of the subject is not\r\nwhat constitutes the merit of Ford's greatest play, pronouncing the famous\r\nlast scene of _The Broken Heart_ extravagant, and fixing on \"a certain\r\nperversity of spirit\" in Ford generally. It is pretty clear that Hartley\r\nColeridge (who might be paralleled in our own day as a critic, who seldom\r\nwent wrong except through ignorance, though he had a sublime indifference\r\nas to the ignorance that sometimes led him wrong) was of no different\r\nopinion. It is not easy to settle such a quarrel. But I had the good\r\nfortune to read Ford before I had read anything except Hartley Coleridge's\r\nrather enigmatic verdict about him, and in the many years that have passed\r\nsince I have read him often again. The resulting opinion may not be\r\nexceptionally valuable, but it has at least stood the test of frequent\r\nre-reading of the original, and of reading of the main authorities among\r\nthe commentators.\r\n\r\nJohn Ford, like Fletcher and Beaumont, but unlike almost all others of his\r\nclass, was a person not compelled by need to write tragedies,--comedies of\r\nany comic merit he could never have written, were they his neck verse at\r\nHairibee. His father was a man of good family and position at Ilsington in\r\nDevon. His mother was of the well-known west-country house of the Pophams.\r\nHe was born(?) two years before the Armada, and three years after\r\nMassinger. He has no university record, but was a member of the Middle\r\nTemple, and takes at least some pains to assure us that he never wrote for\r\nmoney. Nevertheless, for the best part of thirty years he was a playwright,\r\nand he is frequently found collaborating with Dekker, the neediest if\r\nnearly the most gifted gutter-playwright of the time. Once he worked with\r\nWebster in a play (_The Murder of the Son upon the Mother_) which must have\r\ngiven the fullest possible opportunity to the appetite of both for horrors.\r\nOnce he, Rowley, and Dekker combined to produce the strange masterpiece\r\n(for a masterpiece it is in its own undisciplined way) of the _Witch of\r\nEdmonton_, where the obvious signs of a play hastily cobbled up to meet a\r\npopular demand do not obscure the talents of the cobblers. It must be\r\nconfessed that there is much less of Ford than of Rowley and Dekker in the\r\npiece, except perhaps its comparative regularity and the quite unreasonable\r\nand unintelligible bloodiness of the murder of Susan. In _The Sun's\r\nDarling_, due to Ford and Dekker, the numerous and charming lyrics are\r\npretty certainly Dekker's; though we could pronounce on this point with\r\nmore confidence if we had the two lost plays, _The Fairy Knight_ and _The\r\nBristowe Merchant_, in which the same collaborators are known to have been\r\nengaged. _The Fancies_, _Chaste and Noble_, and _The Lady's Trial_ which we\r\nhave, and which are known to be Ford's only, are but third-rate work by\r\ncommon consent, and _Love's Sacrifice_ has excited still stronger opinions\r\nof condemnation from persons favourable to Ford. This leaves us practically\r\nfour plays upon which to base our estimate--_'Tis Pity She's a Whore_, _The\r\nLover's Melancholy_, _The Broken Heart_, and _Perkin Warbeck_. The\r\nlast-named I shall take the liberty of dismissing summarily with the same\r\nborrowed description as Webster's _Appius and Virginia_. Hartley Coleridge,\r\nperhaps willing to make up if he could for a general distaste for Ford,\r\nvolunteered the strange judgment that it is the best specimen of the\r\nhistoric drama to be found out of Shakespere; and Hazlitt says nothing\r\nsavage about it. I shall say nothing more, savage or otherwise. _The\r\nLover's Melancholy_ has been to almost all its critics a kind of lute-case\r\nfor the very pretty version of Strada's fancy about the nightingale, which\r\nCrashaw did better; otherwise it is naught. We are, therefore, left with\r\n_'Tis Pity She's a Whore_ and _The Broken Heart_. For myself, in respect to\r\nthe first, after repeated readings and very careful weighings of what has\r\nbeen said, I come back to my first opinion--to wit, that the Annabella and\r\nGiovanni scenes, with all their perversity, all their availing themselves\r\nof what Hazlitt, with his unerring instinct, called \"unfair attractions,\"\r\nare among the very best things of their kind. Of what may be thought unfair\r\nin them I shall speak a little later: but allowing for this, the sheer\r\neffects of passion--the \"All for love and the world well lost,\" the\r\nshutting out, not instinctively or stupidly, but deliberately, and with\r\nfull knowledge, of all other considerations except the dictates of\r\ndesire--have never been so rendered in English except in _Romeo and Juliet_\r\nand _Antony and Cleopatra_. The comparison of course brings out Ford's\r\nweakness, not merely in execution, but in design; not merely in\r\naccomplishment, but in the choice of means for accomplishment. Shakespere\r\nhad no need of the _haut gout_ of incest, of the unnatural horrors of the\r\nheart on the dagger. But Ford had; and he in a way (I do not say fully)\r\njustified his use of these means.\r\n\r\n_The Broken Heart_ stands far lower. I own that I am with Hazlitt, not\r\nLamb, on the question of the admired death scene of Calantha. In the first\r\nplace, it is certainly borrowed from Marston's _Malcontent_; in the second,\r\nit is wholly unnatural; in the third, the great and crowning point of it is\r\nnot, as Lamb seemed to think, Calantha's sentimental inconsistency, but the\r\nconsistent and noble death of Orgilus. There Ford was at home, and long as\r\nit is it must be given:--\r\n\r\n     _Cal._ \"Bloody relator of thy stains in blood,\r\n            For that thou hast reported him, whose fortunes\r\n            And life by thee are both at once snatch'd from him,\r\n            With honourable mention, make thy choice\r\n            Of what death likes thee best, there's all our bounty.\r\n            But to excuse delays, let me, dear cousin,\r\n            Intreat you and these lords see execution\r\n            Instant before you part.\r\n\r\n    _Near._ Your will commands us.\r\n\r\n     _Org._ One suit, just queen, my last: vouchsafe your clemency\r\n            That by no common hand I be divided\r\n            From this my humble frailty.\r\n\r\n     _Cal._ To their wisdoms\r\n            Who are to be spectators of thine end\r\n            I make the reference: those that are dead\r\n            Are dead; had they not now died, of necessity\r\n            They must have paid the debt they owed to nature,\r\n            One time or other.

But if anything\r\ncould be decisive against Ford being \"of the first order of poets,\" even of\r\ndramatic poets, it would be the total lack of interest in the characters of\r\nCalantha and Ithocles. Fate-disappointed love seems (no doubt from\r\nsomething in his own history) to have had a singular attraction for Lamb;\r\nand the glorification, or, as it were, apotheosis of it in Calantha must\r\nhave appealed to him in one of those curious and illegitimate ways which\r\nevery critic knows. But the mere introduction of Bassanes would show that\r\nFord is not of the first order of poets. He is a purely contemptible\r\ncharacter, neither sublimed by passion of jealousy, nor kept whole by salt\r\nof comic exposition; a mischievous poisonous idiot who ought to have had\r\nhis brains knocked out, and whose brains would assuredly have been knocked\r\nout, by any Orgilus of real life. He is absolutely unequal to the place of\r\ncentral personage, and causer of the harms, of a romantic tragedy such as\r\n_The Broken Heart_.\r\n\r\nI have said \"by any Orgilus of real life,\" but Ford has little to do with\r\nreal life; and it is in this fact that the insufficiency of his claim to\r\nrank among the first order of poets lies. He was, it is evident, a man of\r\nthe greatest talent, even of great genius, who, coming at the end of a long\r\nliterary movement, exemplified the defects of its decadence. I could\r\ncompare him, if there was here any space for such a comparison, to\r\nBaudelaire or Flaubert with some profit; except that he never had\r\nBaudelaire's perfect sense of art, and that he does not seem, like\r\nFlaubert, to have laid in, before melancholy marked him for her own, a\r\nsufficient stock of living types to save him from the charge of being a\r\nmere study-student. There is no Frederic, no M. Homais, in his repertory.\r\nEven Giovanni--even Orgilus, his two masterpieces, are, if not exactly\r\nthings of shreds and patches, at any rate artificial persons, young men who\r\nhave known more of books than of life, and who persevere in their eccentric\r\ncourses with almost more than a half knowledge that they are eccentric.\r\nAnnabella is incomplete, though there is nothing, except her love,\r\nunnatural in her. The strokes which draw her are separate imaginations of a\r\nlearned draughtsman, not fresh transcripts from the living model. Penthea\r\nand Calantha are wholly artificial; a live Penthea would never have thought\r\nof such a fantastic martyrdom, unless she had been insane or suffering from\r\ngreen-sickness, and a live Calantha would have behaved in a perfectly\r\ndifferent fashion, or if she had behaved in the same, would have been quit\r\nfor her temporary aberration. We see (or at least I think I see) in Ford\r\nexactly the signs which are so familiar to us in our own day, and which\r\nrepeat themselves regularly at the end of all periods of distinct literary\r\ncreativeness--the signs of _excentricite voulue_. The author imagines that\r\n\"all is said\" in the ordinary way, and that he must go to the ends of the\r\nearth to fetch something extraordinary. If he is strong enough, as Ford\r\nwas, he fetches it, and it _is_ something extraordinary, and we owe him,\r\nwith all his extravagance, respect and honour for his labour. But we can\r\nnever put him on the level of the men who, keeping within ordinary limits,\r\nachieve masterpieces there.\r\n\r\nFord--an Elizabethan in the strict sense for nearly twenty years--did not\r\nsuffer from the decay which, as noted above, set in in regard to\r\nversification and language among the men of his own later day. He has not\r\nthe natural trick of verse and phrase which stamps his greatest\r\ncontemporaries unmistakably, and even such lesser ones as his collaborator,\r\nDekker, with a hardly mistakable mark; but his verse is nervous, well\r\nproportioned, well delivered, and at its best a noble medium. He was by\r\ngeneral consent utterly incapable of humour, and his low-comedy scenes are\r\namong the most loathsome in the English theatre. His lyrics are not equal\r\nto Shakespere's or Fletcher's, Dekker's or Shirley's, but they are better\r\nthan Massinger's. Although he frequently condescended to the Fletcherian\r\nlicense of the redundant syllable, he never seems to have dropped (as\r\nFletcher did sometimes, or at least allowed his collaborators to drop)\r\nfloundering into the Serbonian bog of stuff that is neither verse nor\r\nprose. He showed indeed (and Mr. Swinburne, with his usual insight, has\r\nnoticed it, though perhaps he has laid rather too much stress on it) a\r\ntendency towards a severe rule-and-line form both of tragic scheme and of\r\ntragic versification, which may be taken to correspond in a certain fashion\r\n(though Mr. Swinburne does not notice this) to the \"correctness\" in\r\nordinary poetry of Waller and his followers. Yet he shows no sign of\r\nwishing to discard either the admixture of comedy with tragedy (save in\r\n_The Broken Heart_, which is perhaps a crucial instance), or blank verse,\r\nor the freedom of the English stage in regard to the unities. In short,\r\nFord was a person distinctly deficient in initiative and planning genius,\r\nbut endowed with a great executive faculty. He wanted guidance in all the\r\ngreater lines of his art, and he had it not; the result being that he\r\nproduced unwholesome and undecided work, only saved by the unmistakable\r\npresence of poetical faculty. I do not think that Webster could ever have\r\ndone anything better than he did: I think that if Ford had been born twenty\r\nyears earlier he might have been second to Shakespere, and at any rate the\r\nequal of Ben Jonson and of Fletcher. But the flagging genius of the time\r\nmade its imprint on his own genius, which was of the second order, not the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nThe honour of being last in the great succession of Elizabethan dramatists\r\nis usually assigned to James Shirley.[62] Though last, Shirley is only in\r\npart least, and his plays deserve more reading than has usually fallen to\r\ntheir lot. Not only in the general character of his plays--a character\r\nhardly definable, but recognisable at once by the reader--but by the\r\noccurrence of such things as the famous song, \"The glories of our blood and\r\nstate,\" and not a few speeches and tirades, Shirley has a right to his\r\nplace; as he most unquestionably has also by date. He was born in London in\r\n1596, was educated at Merchant Tailors' School, and was a member of both\r\nuniversities, belonging to St. John's College at Oxford, and to Catherine\r\nHall at Cambridge. Like other dramatists he vacillated in religion, with\r\nsuch sincerity as to give up a living to which, having been ordained, he\r\nhad been presented. He was a schoolmaster for a time, began to write plays\r\nabout the date of the accession of Charles I., continued to do so till the\r\nclosing of the theatres, then returned to schoolmastering, and survived the\r\nRestoration nearly seven years, being buried at St. Giles's in 1666. He\r\nappears to have visited Ireland, and at least one monument of his visit\r\nremains in the eccentric play of _St. Patrick for Ireland_. He is usually\r\ncredited with thirty-nine plays, to which it is understood that others, now\r\nin MS., have to be added, while he may also have had a hand in some that\r\nare printed but not attributed to him. Shirley was neither a very great nor\r\na very strong man; and without originals to follow, it is probable that he\r\nwould have done nothing. But with Fletcher and Jonson before him he was\r\nable to strike out a certain line of half-humorous, half-romantic drama,\r\nand to follow it with curious equality through his long list of plays,\r\nhardly one of which is very much better than any other, hardly one of which\r\nfalls below a very respectable standard. He has few or no single scenes or\r\npassages of such high and sustained excellence as to be specially quotable;\r\nand there is throughout him an indefinable flavour as of study of his\r\nelders and betters, an appearance as of a highly competent and gifted pupil\r\nin a school, not as of a master and leader in a movement. The palm is\r\nperhaps generally and rightly assigned to _The Lady of Pleasure_, 1635, a\r\nplay bearing some faint resemblances to Massinger's _City Madam_, and\r\nFletcher's _Noble Gentleman_ (Shirley is known to have finished one or two\r\nplays of Fletcher's), and in its turn the original, or at least the\r\nforerunner of a long line of late seventeenth and eighteenth century plays\r\non the extravagance and haughtiness and caprice of fine ladies. Shirley\r\nindeed was much acted after the Restoration, and exhibits, though on the\r\nbetter side, the transition of the older into the newer school very well.\r\nOf his tragedies _The Traitor_ has the general suffrage, and perhaps\r\njustly. One of Shirley's most characteristic habits was that not of exactly\r\nadapting an old play, but of writing a new one on similar lines\r\naccommodated to the taste of his own day. He constantly did this with\r\nFletcher, and once in _The Cardinal_ he was rash enough to endeavour to\r\nimprove upon Webster. His excuse may have been that he was evidently in\r\nclose contact with the last survivors of the great school, for besides his\r\nwork with or on Fletcher, he collaborated with Chapman in the tragedy of\r\n_Chabot_ and the comedy of _The Ball_--the latter said to be one of the\r\nearliest _loci_ for the use of the word in the sense of an entertainment.\r\nHis versification profited by this personal or literary familiarity. It is\r\noccasionally lax, and sins especially by the redundant syllable or\r\nsyllables, and by the ugly break between auxiliary verbs and their\r\ncomplements, prepositions and their nouns, and so forth. But it never falls\r\ninto the mere shapelessness which was so common with his immediate and\r\nyounger contemporaries. Although, as has been said, long passages of high\r\nsustained poetry are not easily producible from him, two short extracts\r\nfrom _The Traitor_ will show his style favourably, but not too favourably.\r\nAmidea, the heroine, declares her intention--\r\n\r\n[62] There was a contemporary, Henry Shirley, who was also a playwright.\r\nHis only extant play, _The Martyred Soldier_, a piece of little merit, has\r\nbeen reprinted by Mr. Bullen.\r\n\r\n                        \"To have my name\r\n    Stand in the ivory register of virgins,\r\n    When I am dead. Before one factious thought\r\n    Should lurk within me to betray my fame\r\n    To such a blot, my hands shall mutiny\r\n    And boldly with a poniard teach my heart\r\n    To weep out a repentance.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this of her brother Florio's is better still--\r\n\r\n    \"Let me look upon my sister now:\r\n    Still she retains her beauty,\r\n    Death has been kind to leave her all this sweetness\r\n    Thus in a morning have I oft saluted\r\n    My sister in her chamber: sat upon\r\n    Her bed and talked of many harmless passages.\r\n    _But now 'tis night, and a long night with her:_\r\n    _I shall ne'er see these curtains drawn again_\r\n    _Until we meet in heaven._\"\r\n\r\nHere the touch, a little weakened it may be, but still the touch of the\r\ngreat age, is perceptible, especially in the last lines, where the metaphor\r\nof the \"curtains,\" common enough in itself for eyelids, derives freshness\r\nand appositeness from the previous mention of the bed. But Shirley is not\r\noften at this high tragic level. His supposed first play, _Love Tricks_,\r\nthough it appeared nearly forty years before the Restoration, has a curious\r\ntouch of post-Restoration comedy in its lively, extravagant, easy farce.\r\nSometimes, as in _The Witty Fair One_, he fell in with the growing habit of\r\nwriting a play mainly in prose, but dropping into verse here and there,\r\nthough he was quite as ready to write, as in _The Wedding_, a play in verse\r\nwith a little prose. Once he dramatised the _Arcadia_ bodily and by name.\r\nAt another time he would match a downright interlude like the _Contention\r\nfor Honour and Riches_ with a thinly-veiled morality like _Honoria and\r\nMammon_. He was a proficient at masques. _The Grateful Servant_, _The Royal\r\nMaster_, _The Duke's Mistress_, _The Doubtful Heir_, _The Constant Maid_,\r\n_The Humorous Courtier_, are plays whose very titles speak them, though the\r\nfirst is much the best. _The Changes_ or _Love in a Maze_ was slightly\r\nborrowed from by Dryden in _The Maiden Queen_, and _Hyde Park_, a very\r\nlively piece, set a fashion of direct comedy of manners which was largely\r\nfollowed, while _The Brothers_ and _The Gamester_ are other good examples\r\nof different styles. Generally Shirley seems to have been a man of amiable\r\ncharacter, and the worst thing on record about him is his very ungenerous\r\ngibing dedication of _The Bird in a Cage_ to Prynne, then in prison, for\r\nhis well-known attack on the stage, a piece of retaliation which, if the\r\nenemy had not been \"down,\" would have been fair enough.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Shirley's comedy deserves as a whole to be better spoken of than\r\nhis tragedy. It is a later variety of the same kind of comedy which we\r\nnoted as written so largely by Middleton,--a comedy of mingled manners,\r\nintrigue, and humours, improved a good deal in coherence and in stage\r\nmanagement, but destitute of the greater and more romantic touches which\r\nemerge from the chaos of the earlier style. Nearly all the writers whom I\r\nshall now proceed to mention practised this comedy, some better, some\r\nworse; but no one with quite such success as Shirley at his best, and no\r\none with anything like his industry, versatility, and generally high level\r\nof accomplishment. It should perhaps be said that the above-mentioned song,\r\nthe one piece of Shirley's generally known, is not from one of his more\r\ncharacteristic pieces, but from _The Contention of Ajax and Ulysses_, a\r\nwork of quite the author's latest days.\r\n\r\nThomas Randolph, the most gifted (according to general estimate rather than\r\nto specific performance) of the Tribe of Ben, was a much younger man than\r\nShirley, though he died more than thirty years earlier. Randolph was born\r\nnear Daventry in 1605, his father being a gentleman, and Lord Zouch's\r\nsteward. He was educated at Westminster, and at Trinity College, Cambridge,\r\nof which he became a fellow, and he was also incorporated at Oxford. His\r\nlife is supposed to have been merry, and was certainly short, for he died,\r\nof what disease is not known, in his thirtieth year. He left, however, no\r\ninconsiderable literary results; and if his dramas are not quite so\r\nrelatively good as his poems (there is certainly none of them which is in\r\nits own kind the equal of the fine answer to Ben Jonson's threat to leave\r\nthe stage and the Ode to Anthony Stafford), still they are interesting and\r\nshow a strong intellect and great literary facility. The two earliest,\r\n_Aristippus_ and _The Conceited Pedlar_, the first a slight dramatic\r\nsketch, the second a monologue, are eminent examples of the class of\r\nuniversity, not to say of undergraduate, wit; but far stronger and fuller\r\nof promise than most specimens of that class. _The Jealous Lovers_, a play\r\nwith classical nomenclature, and at first seeming to aim at the Terentian\r\nmodel, drifts off into something like the Jonsonian humour-comedy, of which\r\nit gives some good studies, but hardly a complete example. Much better are\r\n_The Muses' Looking-Glass_ and _Amyntas_, in which Randolph's academic\r\nschemes and names do not hide his vivid and fertile imagination. _The\r\nMuses' Looking-Glass_, a play vindicating the claim of the drama in general\r\nto the title, is a kind of morality, but a morality carried off with\r\ninfinite spirit, which excuses the frigid nature of the abstractions\r\npresented in it, and not seldom rises to the height of real comedy. The\r\nscene between Colax and Dyscolus, the professional flatterer and the\r\nprofessional snarler, is really excellent: and others equally good might be\r\npicked out. Of the two I am inclined to think that this play shows more\r\nnatural genius in the writer for its style, than the pretty pastoral of\r\n_Amyntas_, which has sometimes been preferred to it. The same penchant for\r\ncomedy appears in _Down with Knavery_, a very free and lively adaptation of\r\nthe _Plutus_ of Aristophanes. There is no doubt that Randolph's work gives\r\nthe impression of considerable power. At the same time it is fair to\r\nremember that the author's life was one very conducive to precocity,\r\ninasmuch as he underwent at once the three stimulating influences of an\r\nelaborate literary education, of endowed leisure to devote himself to what\r\nliterary occupations he pleased, and of the emulation caused by literary\r\nsociety. Jonson's friendship seems to have acted as a forcing-house on the\r\nliterary faculties of his friends, and it is quite as possible that, if\r\nRandolph had lived, he would have become a steady-going soaker or a\r\ndiligent but not originally productive scholar, as that he would have\r\nproduced anything of high substantive and permanent value. It is true that\r\nmany great writers had not at his age done such good work; but then it must\r\nbe remembered that they had also produced little or nothing in point of\r\nbulk. It may be plausibly argued that, good as what Randolph's first thirty\r\nyears gave is, it ought to have been better still if it was ever going to\r\nbe of the best. Hut these excursions into possibilities are not very\r\nprofitable, and the chief excuse for indulging in them is that Randolph's\r\ncritics and editors have generally done the same, and have as a rule\r\nperhaps pursued the indulgence in a rather too enthusiastic and sanguine\r\nspirit. What is not disputable at all is the example given by Randolph of\r\nthe powerful influence of Ben on his \"tribe.\"\r\n\r\nVery little is known of another of that tribe, Richard Brome. He was once\r\nservant to Ben Jonson, who, though in his own old age he was himself an\r\nunsuccessful, and Brome a very successful, dramatist, seems always to have\r\nregarded him with favour, and not to have been influenced by the rather\r\nilliberal attempts of Randolph and others to stir up bad blood between\r\nthem. Brome deserved this favour, and spoke nobly of his old master even\r\nafter Ben's death. He himself was certainly dead in 1653, when some of his\r\nplays were first collected by his namesake (but it would seem not\r\nrelation), Alexander Brome. The modern reprint of his dramas takes the\r\nliberty, singular in the collection to which it belongs, of not attempting\r\nany kind of critical or biographical introduction, and no book of reference\r\nthat I know is much more fertile, the latest authority--the _Dictionary of\r\nNational Biography_, in which Brome is dealt with by the very competent\r\nhand of the Master of Peterhouse--having little enough to tell. Brome's\r\nwork, however, speaks for itself and pretty distinctly to all who care to\r\nread it. It consists, as printed (for there were others now lost or\r\nuncollected), of fifteen plays, all comedies, all bearing a strong family\r\nlikeness, and all belonging to the class of comedy just referred to--that\r\nis to say, a cross between the style of Jonson and that of Fletcher. Of the\r\ngreater number of these, even if there were space here, there would be very\r\nlittle to say beyond this general description. Not one of them is rubbish;\r\nnot one of them is very good; but all are readable, or would be if they had\r\nreceived the trouble spent on much far inferior work, of a little editing\r\nto put the mechanical part of their presentation, such as the division of\r\nscenes, stage directions, etc., in a uniform and intelligible condition.\r\nTheir names (_A Mad Couple well Matched_, _The Sparagus Garden_, _The City\r\nWit_, and so forth) tell a good deal about their most common form; while\r\nin _The Lovesick Court_, and one or two others, the half-courtly,\r\nhalf-romantic comedy of Fletcher takes the place of urban humours. One or\r\ntwo, such as _The Queen and Concubine_, attempt a statelier and tragi-comic\r\nstyle, but this was not Brome's forte. Sometimes, as in _The Antipodes_,\r\nthere is an attempt at satire and comedy with a purpose. There are,\r\nhowever, two plays which stand out distinctly above the rest, and which are\r\nthe only plays of Brome's known to any but diligent students of this class\r\nof literature. These are _The Northern Lass_ and _A Jovial Crew_. The first\r\ndiffers from its fellows only as being of the same class, but better; and\r\nthe dialect of the _ingenue_ Constance seems to have been thought\r\ninteresting and pathetic. _The Jovial Crew_, with its lively pictures of\r\ngipsy life, is, though it may have been partly suggested by Fletcher's\r\n_Beggar's Bush_, a very pleasant and fresh comedy. It seems to have been\r\none of its author's last works, and he speaks of himself in it as \"old.\"\r\n\r\nOur two next figures are of somewhat minor importance. Sir Aston Cokain or\r\nCockaine, of a good Derbyshire family, was born in 1608, and after a long\r\nlife died just before the accession of James II. He seems (and indeed\r\npositively asserts himself) to have been intimate with most of the men of\r\nletters of Charles I.'s reign; and it has been unkindly suggested that\r\nposterity would have been much more indebted to him if he had given us the\r\nbiographical particulars, which in most cases are so much wanted concerning\r\nthem, instead of wasting his time on translated and original verse of very\r\nlittle value, and on dramatic composition of still less. As it is, we owe\r\nto him the knowledge of the not unimportant fact that Massinger was a\r\ncollaborator of Fletcher. His own plays are distinctly of the lower class,\r\nthough not quite valueless. _The Obstinate Lady_ is an echo of Fletcher and\r\nMassinger; _Trappolin Creduto Principe_, an adaptation of an Italian farce,\r\nis a good deal better, and is said, with various stage alterations, to have\r\nheld the boards till within the present century under the title of _A Duke\r\nand no Duke_, or _The Duke and the Devil_. It is in fact a not unskilful\r\nworking up of some well-tried theatrical motives, but has no great literary\r\nmerit. The tragedy of _Ovid_, a regular literary tragedy in careful if not\r\nvery powerful blank verse, is Cokain's most ambitious effort. Like his\r\nother work it is clearly an \"echo\" in character.\r\n\r\nA more interesting and characteristic example of the \"decadence\" is Henry\r\nGlapthorne. When the enthusiasm excited by Lamb's specimens, Hazlitt's, and\r\nColeridge's lectures for the Elizabethan drama, was fresh, and everybody\r\nwas hunting for new examples of the style, Glapthorne had the doubtful luck\r\nto be made the subject of a very laudatory article in the _Retrospective\r\nReview_, and two of his plays were reprinted. He was not left in this\r\nhonourable but comparatively safe seclusion, and many years later, in 1874,\r\nall his plays and poems as known were issued by themselves in Mr. Pearson's\r\nvaluable series of reprints. Since then Glapthorne has become something of\r\na butt; and Mr. Bullen, in conjecturally attributing to him a new play,\r\n_The Lady Mother_, takes occasion to speak rather unkindly of him. As usual\r\nit is a case of _ni cet exces d'honneur ni cette indignite_. Personally,\r\nGlapthorne has some of the interest that attaches to the unknown. Between\r\n1639 and 1643, or for the brief space of four years, it is clear that he\r\nwas a busy man of letters. He published five plays (six if we admit _The\r\nLady Mother_), which had some vogue, and survived as an acted poet into the\r\nRestoration period; he produced a small but not despicable collection of\r\npoems of his own; he edited those of his friend Thomas Beedome; he was\r\nhimself a friend of Cotton and of Lovelace. But of his antecedents and of\r\nthe life that followed this short period of literary activity we know\r\nabsolutely nothing. The guess that he was at St. Paul's School is a mere\r\nguess; and in the utter and total absence of the least scrap of\r\nbiographical information about him, his editor has thought it worth while\r\nto print in full some not unamusing but perfectly irrelevant documents\r\nconcerning the peccadillos of a certain _George_ Glapthorne of Whittlesea,\r\nwho was certainly a contemporary and perhaps a relation. Henry Glapthorne\r\nas a writer is certainly not great, but he is as certainly not\r\ncontemptible. His tragedy of _Albertus Wallenstein_ is not merely\r\ninteresting as showing a reversion to the practice, almost dropped in his\r\ntime (perhaps owing to censorship difficulties), of handling contemporary\r\nhistorical subjects, but contains passages of considerable poetical merit.\r\nHis _Argalus and Parthenia_, a dramatisation of part of the _Arcadia_,\r\ncaught the taste of his day, and, like the _Wallenstein_, is poetical if\r\nnot dramatic. The two comedies, _The Hollander_ and _Wit in a Constable_,\r\nare of the school which has been so frequently described, and not of its\r\nstrongest, but at the same time not of its weakest specimens. _Love's\r\nPrivilege_, sometimes held his best play, is a rather flabby tragi-comedy\r\nof the Fletcher-Shirley school. In short, Glapthorne, without being\r\npositively good, is good enough to have made it surprising that he is not\r\nbetter, if the explanation did not present itself pretty clearly. Though\r\nevidently not an old man at the time of writing (he has been guessed,\r\nprobably enough, to have been a contemporary of Milton, and perhaps a\r\nlittle older or a little younger), his work has the clear defects of age.\r\nIt is garrulous and given to self-repetition (so much so that one of Mr.\r\nBullen's reasons for attributing _The Lady Mother_ to Glapthorne is the\r\noccurrence in it of passages almost literally repeated in his known work);\r\nit testifies to a relish of, and a habituation to, the great school,\r\ncoupled with powers insufficient to emulate the work of the great school\r\nitself; it is exactly in flavour and character the last _not_ sprightly\r\nrunnings of a generous liquor. There is nowhere in it the same absolute\r\nflatness that occurs in the lesser men of the Restoration school, like the\r\nHowards and Boyle; the ancient gust is still too strong for that. It does\r\nnot show the vulgarity which even Davenant (who as a dramatist was ten\r\nyears Glapthorne's senior) too often displays. But we feel in reading it\r\nthat the good wine has gone, that we have come to that which is worse.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned Davenant; and though he is often classed with, and to some\r\nextent belongs to the post-Reformation school, he is ours for other\r\npurposes than that of mere mention. His Shakespere travesties (in one of\r\nwhich he was assisted by a greater than he), and even the operas and\r\n\"entertainments\" with which he not only evaded the prohibition of stage\r\nplays under the Commonwealth, but helped to produce a remarkable change in\r\nthe English drama, do not concern us. But it must be remembered that\r\nDavenant's earlier, most dramatic, and most original playmaking was done at\r\na time far within our limits. When the tragedy of _Albovine_ (Alboin) was\r\nproduced, the Restoration was more than thirty years distant, and Jonson,\r\nChapman, Dekker, and Marston--men in the strictest sense of the Elizabethan\r\nschool--were still living, and, in the case of all but Marston, writing.\r\n_The Cruel Brother_, which, though printed after, was licensed before,\r\ndates three years earlier; and between this time and the closing of the\r\ntheatres Davenant had ten plays acted and printed coincidently with the\r\nbest work of Massinger, Shirley, and Ford. Nor, though his fame is far\r\nbelow theirs, is the actual merit of these pieces (the two above mentioned,\r\n_The Wits_, _News from Plymouth_, _The Fair Favourite_, _The Unfortunate\r\nLovers_, etc.), so much inferior as the fame. The chief point in which\r\nDavenant fails is in the failing grasp of verse above noted. This is\r\ncurious and so characteristic that it is worth while to give an example of\r\nit, which shall be a fair average specimen and not of the worst:--\r\n\r\n    \"O noble maid, what expiation can\r\n    Make fit this young and cruel soldier for\r\n    Society of man that hath defiled\r\n    The genius of triumphant glorious war\r\n    With such a rape upon thy liberty!\r\n    Or what less hard than marble of\r\n    The Parian rock can'st thou believe my heart,\r\n    That nurst and bred him my disciple in\r\n    The camp, and yet could teach his valour no\r\n    More tenderness than injured Scytheans use\r\n    When they are wroth to a revenge? But he\r\n    Hath mourned for it: and now Evandra thou\r\n    Art strongly pitiful, that dost so long\r\n    Conceal an anger that would kill us both.\"\r\n\r\n                    _Love and Honour_, 1649.\r\n\r\nHere we have the very poetical counterpart of the last of Jaques' ages, the\r\nbig manly voice of the great dramatists sinking into a childish treble that\r\nstutters and drivels over the very alphabet of the poetical tongue.\r\n\r\nIn such a language as this poetry became impossible, and it is still a\r\nmatter for wonder by what trick of elocution actors can have made it\r\ntolerable on the stage. Yet it was certainly tolerated. And not only so,\r\nbut, when the theatre came to be open again, the discontent with blank\r\nverse, which partly at least drove Dryden and others into rhyme, never\r\nseems to have noticed the fact that the blank verse to which it objected\r\nwas execrably bad. When Dryden returned to the more natural medium, he\r\nwrote it not indeed with the old many-voiced charm of the best\r\nElizabethans, but with admirable eloquence and finish. Yet he himself in\r\nhis earliest plays staggered and slipped about with the rest, and I do not\r\nremember in his voluminous critical remarks anything going to show that he\r\nwas consciously aware of the slovenliness into which his master Davenant\r\nand others had allowed themselves and their followers to drop.\r\n\r\nOne more example and we shall have finished at once with those dramatists\r\nof our time whose work has been collected, and with the chief names of the\r\ndecadence. Sir John Suckling, who, in Mr. Swinburne's happy phrase--\r\n\r\n                        \"Stumbled from above\r\n    And reeled in slippery roads of alien art,\"\r\n\r\nis represented in the English theatre by four plays, _Aglaura_,\r\n_Brennoralt_, _The Sad One_, and the comedy of _The Goblins_. Of the\r\ntragedies some one, I forget who, has said truly that their names are the\r\nbest thing about them. Suckling had a fancy for romantic names, rather\r\nsuggesting sometimes the Minerva press of a later time, but still pretty.\r\nHis serious plays, however, have all the faults, metrical and other, which\r\nhave been noticed in Davenant, and in speaking of his own non-dramatic\r\nverse; and they possess as well serious faults as dramas--a combination of\r\nextravagance and dullness, a lack of playwright's grasp, an absence in\r\nshort of the root of the matter. How far in other directions besides mere\r\nversification he and his fellows had slipped from the right way, may be\r\nperhaps most pleasantly and quite fully discovered from the perusal, which\r\nis not very difficult, of his tragi-comedy or extravaganza, _The Goblins_.\r\nThere are several good points about this play--an abundance of not\r\naltogether stagey noble sentiment, an agreeable presentment of fresh and\r\ngallant youths, still smacking rather of Fletcher's madcap but heart-sound\r\ngallants, and not anticipating the heartless crudity of the cubs of the\r\nRestoration, a loveable feminine character, and so forth. But hardly a\r\nclever boy at school ever devised anything so extravagantly puerile as the\r\nplot, which turns on a set of banished men playing at hell and devils in\r\ncaverns close to a populous city, and brings into the action a series of\r\nthe most absurd escapes, duels, chance-meetings, hidings, findings, and all\r\nmanner of other devices for spinning out an unnatural story. Many who know\r\nnothing more of Suckling's plays know that _Aglaura_ enjoys the eccentric\r\npossession of two fifth acts, so that it can be made a tragedy or a\r\ntragi-comedy at pleasure. _The Sad One_, which is unfinished, is much\r\nbetter. The tragedy of _Brennoralt_ has some pathos, some pretty scenes,\r\nand some charming songs; but here again we meet with the most inconceivably\r\nbad verse, as here--a passage all the more striking because of its attempt,\r\nwilful or unconscious, to echo Shakespere:--\r\n\r\n    \"Sleep is as nice as woman;\r\n    The more I court it, the more it flies me.\r\n    Thy elder brother will be kinder yet,\r\n    Unsent-for death will come. To-morrow!\r\n    Well, what can to-morrow do?\r\n    'Twill cure the sense of honour lost;\r\n    I and my discontents shall rest together,\r\n    What hurt is there in this? But death against\r\n    The will is but a slovenly kind of potion;\r\n    And though prescribed by Heaven, it goes against men's stomachs.\r\n    So does it at fourscore too, when the soul's\r\n    Mewed up in narrow darkness: neither sees nor hears.\r\n    Pish! 'tis mere fondness in our nature.\r\n    A certain clownish cowardice that still\r\n    Would stay at home and dares not venture\r\n    Into foreign countries, though better than\r\n    Its own. Ha! what countries? for we receive\r\n    Descriptions of th' other world from our divines\r\n    As blind men take relations of this from us:\r\n    My thoughts lead me into the dark, and there\r\n    They'll leave me. I'll no more on it. Within!\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the last notes of the concert which opened with the music, if not\r\nat once of _Hamlet_ and _Othello_, at any rate of _Tamburlaine_ and\r\n_Faustus_.\r\n\r\nTo complete this sketch of the more famous and fortunate dramatists who\r\nhave attained to separate presentation, we must give some account of lesser\r\nmen and of those wholly anonymous works which are still to be found only in\r\ncollections such as Dodsley's, or in single publications. As the years\r\npass, the list of independently published authors increases. Mr. Bullen,\r\nwho issued the works of Thomas Nabbes and of Davenport, has promised those\r\nof W. Rowley. Nabbes, a member of the Tribe of Ben, and a man of easy\r\ntalent, was successful in comedy only, though he also attempted tragedy.\r\n_Microcosmus_ (1637), his best-known work, is half-masque, half-morality,\r\nand has considerable merit in a difficult kind. _The Bride_, _Covent\r\nGarden_, _Tottenham Court_, range with the already characterised work of\r\nBrome, but somewhat lower. Davenport's range was wider, and the interesting\r\nhistory of _King John and Matilda_, as well as the lively comedy of _The\r\nCity Nightcap_, together with other work, deserved, and have now received,\r\ncollection. William Rowley was of a higher stamp. His best work is probably\r\nto be found in the plays wherein, as mentioned more than once, he\r\ncollaborated with Middleton, with Massinger, with Webster, with Fletcher,\r\nwith Dekker, and in short with most of the best men of his time. It would\r\nappear that he was chiefly resorted to for comic underplots, in which he\r\nbrought in a good deal of horseplay, and a power of reporting the low-life\r\nhumours of the London of his day more accurate than refined, together with\r\nnot a little stock-stage wit, such as raillery of Welsh and Irish dialect.\r\nBut in the plays which are attributed to him alone, such as _A New Wonder_,\r\n_a Woman Never Vexed_, and _A Match at Midnight_, he shows not merely this\r\nsame _vis comica_ and rough and ready faculty of hitting off dramatic\r\nsituations, but an occasional touch of true pathos, and a faculty of\r\nknitting the whole action well together. He has often been confused with a\r\nhalf namesake, Samuel Rowley, of whom very little is known, but who in his\r\nchronicle play _When you see Me you know Me_, and his romantic drama of\r\n_The Noble Spanish Soldier_, has distinctly outstripped the ordinary\r\ndramatists of the time. Yet another collected dramatist, who has long had a\r\nhome in Dodsley, and who figures rather curiously in a later collection of\r\n\"Dramatists of the Restoration,\" though his dramatic fame was obtained many\r\nyears before, was Shakerley Marmion, author of the pretty poem of _Cupid\r\nand Psyche_, and a \"son\" of Ben Jonson. Marmion's three plays, of which the\r\nbest known is _The Antiquary_, are fair but not excessively favourable\r\nsamples of the favourite play of the time, a rather broad humour-comedy,\r\nwhich sometimes conjoined itself with, and sometimes stood aloof from,\r\neither a romantic and tragi-comical story or a downright tragedy.\r\n\r\nAmong the single plays comparatively few are of the latter kind. _The\r\nMiseries of Enforced Marriage_, a domestic tragi-comedy, connects itself\r\nwith the wholly tragical _Yorkshire Tragedy_, and is a kind of introduction\r\nto it. These domestic tragedies (of which another is _A Warning to Fair\r\nWomen_) were very popular at the time, and large numbers now lost seem to\r\nhave been produced by the dramatisation of notable crimes, past and\r\npresent. Their class is very curiously mixed up with the remarkable and, in\r\none sense or another, very interesting class of the dramas attributed, and\r\nin general estimation falsely attributed, to Shakespere. According to the\r\nfullest list these pseudo-Shakesperian plays number seventeen. They are\r\n_Fair Em_, _The Merry Devil of Edmonton_, _Edward III._, _The Birth of\r\nMerlin_, _The Troublesome Reign of King John_, _A Warning to Fair Women_,\r\n_The Arraignment of Paris_, _Arden of Feversham_, _Mucedorus_, _George a\r\nGreen the Pinner of Wakefield_, _The Two Noble Kinsmen_, _The London\r\nProdigal_, _Thomas Lord Cromwell_, _Sir John Oldcastle_, _The Puritan or\r\nthe Widow of Watling Street_, _The Yorkshire Tragedy_, and _Locrine_. Four\r\nof these, _Edward III._, _The Merry Devil of Edmonton_, _Arden of\r\nFeversham_, and _The Two Noble Kinsmen_, are in whole or parts very far\r\nsuperior to the rest. Of that rest _The Yorkshire Tragedy_, a violent and\r\nbloodthirsty little piece showing the frantic cruelty of the ruined\r\ngambler, Calverley, to his wife and children, is perhaps the most powerful,\r\nthough it is not in the least Shakesperian. But the four have claims, not\r\nindeed of a strong, but of a puzzling kind. In _Edward III._ and _The Two\r\nNoble Kinsmen_ there are no signs of Shakespere either in plot,\r\ncharacter-drawing, or general tone. But, on the contrary, there are in both\r\ncertain scenes where the versification and dialogue are so astonishingly\r\nShakesperian that it is almost impossible to account for the writing of\r\nthem by any one else than Shakespere. By far the larger majority of critics\r\ndeclare for the part authorship of Shakespere in _The Two Noble Kinsmen_; I\r\navow myself simply puzzled. On the other hand, I am nearly sure that he did\r\nnot write any part of _Edward III._, and I should take it to be a case of a\r\nkind not unknown in literature, where some writer of great but not very\r\noriginal faculty was strongly affected by the Shakesperian influence, and\r\nwrote this play while under it, but afterwards, either by death or\r\ndiversion to non-literary employments, left no other monument of himself\r\nthat can be traced or compared with it. The difficulty with _Arden of\r\nFeversham_ and _The Merry Devil_ is different. We shall presently speak of\r\nthe latter, which, good as it is, has nothing specially Shakesperian about\r\nit, except a great superiority in sanity, compactness, pleasant human\r\nsentiment, and graceful verse, to the ordinary anonymous or named work of\r\nthe time. But _Arden of Feversham_ is a very different piece of work. It is\r\na domestic tragedy of a peculiarly atrocious kind, Alice Arden, the wife,\r\nbeing led by her passion for a base paramour, Mosbie, to plot, and at last\r\ncarry out, the murder of her husband. Here it is not that the versification\r\nhas much resemblance to Shakespere's, or that single speeches smack of him,\r\nbut that the dramatic grasp of character both in principals and in\r\nsecondary characters has a distinct touch of his almost unmistakable hand.\r\nYet both in the selection and in the treatment of the subject the play\r\ndefinitely transgresses those principles which have been said to exhibit\r\nthemselves so uniformly and so strongly in the whole great body of his\r\nundoubted plays. There is a perversity and a dash of sordidness which are\r\nboth wholly un-Shakesperian. The only possible hypothesis on which it could\r\nbe admitted as Shakespere's would be that of an early experiment thrown off\r\nwhile he was seeking his way in a direction where he found no thoroughfare.\r\nBut the play is a remarkable one, and deserves the handsome and exact\r\nreproduction which Mr. Bullen has given it. _The Second Maiden's Tragedy_,\r\nlicensed 1611, but earlier in type, is one of the gloomy pity-and-terror\r\npieces which were so much affected in the earlier part of the period, but\r\nwhich seem to have given way later in the public taste to comedy. It is\r\nblack enough to have been attributed to Tourneur. _The Queen of Aragon_, by\r\nHabington, though in a different key, has something of the starchness\r\nrather than strength which characterises _Castara_. A much higher level is\r\nreached in the fine anonymous tragedy of _Nero_, where at least one\r\ncharacter, that of Petronius, is of great excellence, and where the verse,\r\nif a little declamatory, is of a very high order of declamation. The\r\nstrange piece, first published by Mr. Bullen, and called by him _The\r\nDistracted Emperor_, a tragedy based partly on the legend of Charlemagne\r\nand Fastrada, again gives us a specimen of horror-mongering. _The Return\r\nfrom Parnassus_ (see note, p. 81), famous for its personal touches and its\r\ncontribution to Shakespere literature, is interesting first for the\r\njudgments of contemporary writers, of which the Shakespere passages are\r\nonly the chief; secondly, for its evidence of the jealousy between the\r\nuniversities and the players, who after, in earlier times, coming chiefly\r\non the university wits for their supplies, had latterly taken to provide\r\nfor themselves; and thirdly, for its flashes of light on university and\r\nespecially undergraduate life. The comedy of _Wily Beguiled_ has also a\r\nstrong university touch, the scholar being made triumphant in it; and\r\n_Lingua_, sometimes attributed to Anthony Brewer, is a return, though a\r\nlively one, to the system of personification and allegory. _The Dumb\r\nKnight_, of or partly by Lewis Machin, belongs to the half-romantic,\r\nhalf-farcical class; but in _The Merry Devil of Edmonton_, the authorship\r\nof which is quite unknown, though Shakespere, Drayton, and other great\r\nnames have been put forward, a really delightful example of romantic\r\ncomedy, strictly English in subject, and combining pathos with wit,\r\nappears. _The Merry Devil_ probably stands highest among all the anonymous\r\nplays of the period on the lighter side, as _Arden of Feversham_ does on\r\nthe darker. Second to it as a comedy comes Porter's _Two Angry Women of\r\nAbingdon_ (1599), with less grace and fancy but almost equal lightness, and\r\na singularly exact picture of manners. With _Ram Alley_, attributed to the\r\nIrishman Lodowick Barry, we come back to a much lower level, that of the\r\nbustling comedy, of which something has been said generally in connection\r\nwith Middleton. To the same class belong Haughton's pleasant _Englishmen\r\nfor my Money_, a good patriot play, where certain foreigners, despite the\r\nfather's favour, are ousted from the courtship of three fair sisters;\r\n_Woman is a Weathercock_, and _Amends for Ladies_ (invective and palinode),\r\nby Nathaniel Field (first one of the little eyasses who competed with\r\nregular actors, and then himself an actor and playwright); Green's \"_Tu\r\nQuoque_\" or _The City Gallant_, attributed to the actor Cook, and deriving\r\nits odd first title from a well-known comedian of the time, and the\r\ncatchword which he had to utter in the play itself; _The Hog hath Lost his\r\nPearl_, a play on the name of a usurer whose daughter is married against\r\nhis will, by Taylor; _The Heir_ and _The Old Couple_, by Thomas May, more\r\nfamous still for his Latin versification; the rather overpraised _Ordinary_\r\nof Cartwright, Ben Jonson's most praised son; _The City Match_ by Dr.\r\nJasper Mayne. All these figure in the last, and most of them have figured\r\nin the earlier editions of Dodsley, with a few others hardly worth separate\r\nnotice. Mr. Bullen's delightful volumes of _Old Plays_ add the capital play\r\nof _Dick of Devonshire_ (see _ante_), the strange _Two Tragedies in One_ of\r\nRobert Yarington, three lively comedies deriving their names from originals\r\nof one kind or another, _Captain Underwit_, _Sir Giles Goosecap_, and _Dr.\r\nDodipoll_, with one or two more. One single play remains to be mentioned,\r\nboth because of its intrinsic merit, and because of the controversy which\r\nhas arisen respecting the question of priority between it and Ben Jonson's\r\n_Alchemist_. This is _Albumazar_, attributed to one Thomas Tomkis, and in\r\nall probability a university play of about the middle of James's reign.\r\nThere is nothing in it equal to the splendid bursts of Sir Epicure Mammon,\r\nor the all but first-rate comedy of Face, Dol, and Subtle, and of Abel\r\nDrugger; but Gifford, in particular, does injustice to it, and it is on the\r\nwhole a very fair specimen of the work of the time. Nothing indeed is more\r\nastonishing than the average goodness of that work, even when all\r\nallowances are made; and unjust as such a mere enumeration as these last\r\nparagraphs have given must be, it would be still more unjust to pass over\r\nin silence work so varied and so full of talent.[63]\r\n\r\n[63] A note may best serve for the plays of Thomas Goff (1591-1629), acted\r\nat his own college, Christ Church, but not published till after his death.\r\nThe three most noteworthy, _The Raging Turk_, _The Courageous Turk_, and\r\nthe _Tragedy of Orestes_, were republished together in 1656, and a comedy,\r\n_The Careless Shepherdess_, appeared in the same year. The tragedies, and\r\nespecially _The Raging Turk_, have been a byword for extravagant frigidity,\r\nthough, as they have never been printed in modern times, and as the\r\noriginals are rare, they have not been widely known at first hand. A\r\nperusal justifies the worst that has been said of them: though Goff wrote\r\nearly enough to escape the Caroline dry-rot in dramatic versification. His\r\nlines are stiff, but they usually scan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nMINOR CAROLINE PROSE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greatest, beyond all doubt, of the minor writers of the Caroline period\r\nin prose is Robert Burton. Less deliberately quaint than Fuller, he is\r\nnever, as Fuller sometimes is, puerile, and the greater concentration of\r\nhis thoughts and studies has produced what Fuller never quite produced, a\r\nmasterpiece. At the same time it must be confessed that Burton's more\r\nleisurely life assisted to a great extent in the production of his work.\r\nThe English collegiate system would have been almost sufficiently justified\r\nif it had produced nothing but _The Anatomy of Melancholy_; though there is\r\nsomething ironical, no doubt, in the fact that this ideal fruit of a\r\nstudious and endowed leisure was the work of one who, being a beneficed\r\nclergyman, ought not in strictness to have been a resident member of a\r\ncollege. Yet, elsewhere than in Oxford or Cambridge the book could hardly\r\nhave grown, and it is as unique as the institutions which produced it.\r\n\r\nThe author of the _Anatomy_ was the son of Ralph Burton of Lindley in\r\nLeicestershire, where he was born on the 8th of February 1577. He was\r\neducated at Sutton Coldfield School, and thence went to Brasenose College,\r\nOxford. He became a student of Christchurch--the equivalent of a fellow--in\r\n1599, and seems to have passed the whole of the rest of his life there,\r\nthough he took orders and enjoyed together or successively the living of\r\nSt. Thomas in Oxford, the vicarage of Walsby in Lincolnshire, and the\r\nrectory of Segrave in Leicestershire, at both of which latter places he\r\nseems to have kept the minimum of residence, though tradition gives him the\r\ncharacter of a good churchman, and though there is certainly nothing\r\ninconsistent with that character in the _Anatomy_. The picture of him which\r\nAnthony a Wood gives at a short second hand is very favourable; and the\r\nattempts to harmonise his \"horrid disorder of melancholy\" with his \"very\r\nmerry, facete, and juvenile company,\" arise evidently from almost ludicrous\r\nmisunderstanding of what melancholy means and is. As absurd, though more\r\nserious, is the traditionary libel obviously founded on the words in his\r\nepitaph (_Cui vitam et mortem dedit melancholia_), that having cast his\r\nnativity, he, in order not to be out as to the time of his death, committed\r\nsuicide. As he was sixty-three (one of the very commonest periods of death)\r\nat the time, the want of reason of the suggestion equals its want of\r\ncharity.\r\n\r\nThe offspring in English of Burton's sixty-three years of humorous study of\r\nmen and books is _The Anatomy of Melancholy_, first printed in 1621, and\r\nenlarged afterwards by the author. A critical edition of the _Anatomy_,\r\ngiving these enlargements exactly with other editorial matter, is very much\r\nwanted; but even in the rather inedited condition in which the book, old\r\nand new, is usually found, it is wholly acceptable. Its literary history is\r\nrather curious. Eight editions of it appeared in half a century from the\r\ndate of the first, and then, with other books of its time, it dropped out\r\nof notice except by the learned. Early in the present century it was\r\nrevived and reprinted with certain modernisations, and four or five\r\neditions succeeded each other at no long interval. The copies thus\r\ncirculated seem to have satisfied the demand for many years, and have been\r\nfollowed without much alteration in some later issues.\r\n\r\nThe book itself has been very variously judged. Fuller, in one of his least\r\nworthy moments, called it \"a book of philology.\" Anthony Wood, hitting on a\r\nnotion which has often been borrowed since, held that it is a convenient\r\ncommonplace book of classical quotations, which, with all respect to\r\nAnthony's memory (whom I am more especially bound to honour as a Merton\r\nman), is a gross and Philistine error. Johnson, as was to be expected,\r\nappreciated it thoroughly. Ferriar in his _Illustrations of Sterne_ pointed\r\nout the enormous indebtedness of Tristram Shandy to Democritus Junior.\r\nCharles Lamb, eloquently praising the \"fantastic great old man,\" exhibited\r\nperhaps more perversity than sense in denouncing the modern reprints which,\r\nafter all, are not like some modern reprints (notably one of Burton's\r\ncontemporary, Felltham, to be noticed shortly), in any real sense garbled.\r\nSince that time Burton has to some extent fallen back to the base uses of a\r\nquarry for half-educated journalists; nevertheless, all fit readers of\r\nEnglish literature have loved him.\r\n\r\nThe book is a sufficiently strange one at first sight; and it is perhaps no\r\ngreat wonder that uncritical readers should have been bewildered by the\r\nbristling quotations from utterly forgotten authorities which, with full\r\nand careful reference for the most part, stud its pages, by its elaborate\r\nbut apparently futile marshalling in \"partitions\" and \"members,\" in\r\n\"sections\" and \"subsections,\" and by the measureless license of digression\r\nwhich the author allows himself. It opens with a long epistle, filling some\r\nhundred pages in the modern editions, from Democritus Junior, as the author\r\ncalls himself, to the reader--an epistle which gives a true foretaste of\r\nthe character and style of the text, though, unlike that text, it is not\r\nscholastically divided. The division begins with the text itself, and even\r\nthe laziest reader will find the synopses of Burton's \"partitions\" a\r\ncurious study. It is impossible to be, at least in appearance, more\r\nmethodical, and all the typographical resources of brackets (sub-bracketed\r\neven to the seventh or eighth involution) and of reference letters are\r\nexhausted in order to draw up a conspectus of the causes, symptoms, nature,\r\neffects, and cure of melancholy. This method is not exactly the method of\r\nmadness, though it is quite possible for a reader to attach more (as also\r\nless) importance to it than it deserves. It seems probable on the whole\r\nthat the author, with the scholastic habits of his time, did actually draw\r\nout a programme for the treatment of his subject in some form not very\r\ndifferent from these wonderful synopses, and did actually endeavour to keep\r\nto it, or at any rate to work on its lines within the general compass of\r\nthe scheme. But on each several head (and reducing them to their lowest\r\nterms the heads are legion) he allowed himself the very widest freedom of\r\ndigression, not merely in extracting and applying the fruits of his\r\nnotebook, but in developing his own thoughts,--a mine hardly less rich if\r\nless extensive than the treasures of the Bodleian Library which are said to\r\nhave been put at his disposal.\r\n\r\nThe consequence is, that the book is one quite impossible to describe in\r\nbrief space. The melancholy of which the author treats, and of which, no\r\ndoubt, he was in some sort the victim, is very far from being the mere\r\nByronic or Wertherian disease which became so familiar some hundred years\r\nago. On the other hand, Burton being a practical, and, on the whole, very\r\nhealthy Englishman, it came something short of \"The Melencolia that\r\ntranscends all wit,\" the incurable pessimism and quiet despair which have\r\nbeen thought to be figured or prefigured in Durer's famous print. Yet it\r\napproaches, and that not distantly, to this latter. It is the Vanity of\r\nVanities of a man who has gone, in thought at least, over the whole round\r\nof human pleasures and interests, and who, if he has not exactly found all\r\nto be vanity, has found each to be accompanied by some _amari aliquid_. It\r\nis at the same time the frankly expressed hypochondria of a man whose\r\nbodily health was not quite so robust as his mental constitution. It is the\r\nsatiety of learning of a man who, nevertheless, knows that learning, or at\r\nleast literature, is the only cure for his disease.\r\n\r\nIn mere style there is perhaps nothing very strongly characteristic in\r\nBurton, though there is much that is noteworthy in the way in which he\r\nadapts his style to the peculiar character of his book. Like Rabelais, he\r\nhas but rarely occasion to break through his fantastic habit of stringing\r\nothers' pearls on a mere string of his own, and to set seriously to the\r\ncomposition of a paragraph of wholly original prose. But when he does, the\r\neffect is remarkable, and shows that it was owing to no poverty or\r\nawkwardness that he chose to be so much of a borrower. In his usual style,\r\nwhere a mere framework of original may enclose a score or more quotations,\r\ntranslated or not (the modern habit of translating Burton's quotations\r\nspoils, among other things, the zest of his own quaint habit of adding, as\r\nit were, in the same breath, a kind of summary or paraphrase in English of\r\nwhat he has said in Latin or Greek), he was not superior to his time in the\r\nloose construction of sentences; but the wonder is that his fashion of\r\nwriting did not make him even inferior to it. One of his peculiar\r\ntricks--the only one, perhaps, which he uses to the extent of a\r\nmannerism--is the suppression of the conjunctions \"or\" and \"and,\" which\r\ngives a very quaint air to his strings of synonyms. But an example will do\r\nmore here than much analysis:--\r\n\r\n     \"And why then should baseness of birth be objected to any man?\r\n     Who thinks worse of Tully for being _Arpinas_, an upstart? or\r\n     Agathocles, that Sicilian King, for being a potter's son?\r\n     Iphicrates and Marius were meanly born. What wise man thinks\r\n     better of any person for his nobility? as he[64] said in\r\n     Machiavel, _omnes codem patre nati_, Adam's sons, conceived all\r\n     and born in sin, etc. _We are by nature all as one, all alike, if\r\n     you see us naked; let us wear theirs, and they our clothes, and\r\n     what's the difference?_ To speak truth, as Bale did of P.\r\n     Schalichius, _I more esteem thy worth, learning, honesty, than\r\n     the nobility; honour thee more that thou art a writer, a doctor\r\n     of divinity, than earl of the Hunnes, baron of Skradine, or hast\r\n     title to such and such provinces, etc. Thou art more fortunate\r\n     and great_ (so Jovius writes to Cosmus Medices, then Duke of\r\n     Florence) _for thy virtues than for thy lovely wife and happy\r\n     children, friends, fortunes, or great Duchy of Tuscany_. So I\r\n     account thee, and who doth not so indeed? Abdalonymus was a\r\n     gardener, and yet by Alexander for his virtues made King of\r\n     Syria. How much better is it to be born of mean parentage and to\r\n     excel in worth, to be morally noble, which is preferred before\r\n     that natural nobility by divines, philosophers, and politicians,\r\n     to be learned, honest, discreet, well qualified to be fit for any\r\n     manner of employment in country and commonwealth, war and peace,\r\n     than to be _degeneres Neoptolemi_ as so many brave nobles are,\r\n     only wise because rich, otherwise idiots, illiterate, unfit for\r\n     any manner of service? Udalricus, Earl of Cilia, upbraided John\r\n     Huniades with the baseness of his birth; but he replied, _In te\r\n     Ciliensis comitatus turpiter exstinguitur, in me gloriose\r\n     Bistricensis exoritur_; thine earldom is consumed with riot; mine\r\n     begins with honour and renown. Thou hast had so many noble\r\n     ancestors; what is that to thee? _Vix ea nostra voco_; when thou\r\n     art a disard[65] thyself, _quid prodest Pontice longo stemmate\r\n     censeri_? etc. I conclude, hast thou a sound body and a good\r\n     soul, good bringing up? Art thou virtuous, honest, learned, well\r\n     qualified, religious? Are thy conditions good? Thou art a true\r\n     nobleman, perfectly noble though born of Thersites, _dummodo tu\r\n     sis Aeacidae similis non natus sed factus_, noble kat' exochen,\r\n     _for neither sword, nor fire, nor water, nor sickness, nor\r\n     outward violence, nor the devil himself can take thy good parts\r\n     from thee_. Be not ashamed of thy birth then; thou art a\r\n     gentleman all the world over, and shalt be honoured, whenas he,\r\n     strip him of his fine clothes, dispossess him of his wealth, is a\r\n     funge[66] (which Polynices in his banishment found true by\r\n     experience, gentry was not esteemed), like a piece of coin in\r\n     another country, that no man will take, and shall be contemned.\r\n     Once more, though thou be a barbarian born at Tontonteac, a\r\n     villain, a slave, a Saldanian negro, or a rude Virginian in\r\n     Dasamonquepeuc,[67] he a French monsieur, a Spanish don, a\r\n     seignior of Italy, I care not how descended, of what family, of\r\n     what order--baron, count, prince--if thou be well qualified and\r\n     he not but a degenerate Neoptolemus, I tell thee in a word thou\r\n     art a man and he is a beast.\"\r\n\r\n[64] Burton, with others of the time, constantly wrote \"he\" as the\r\nequivalent of the classical demonstratives. Modern, but not better, use\r\nprefers \"the man,\" or something similar.\r\n\r\n[65] A \"dizzard\" = a blockhead. Said to be connected with \"dizzy.\"\r\n\r\n[66] Fungus, mushroom.\r\n\r\n[67] Saldania is Saldanha Bay. As for Tontonteac and Dasamonquepeuc, I\r\nshall imitate the manly frankness of the boy in _Henry V._, and say, \"I do\r\nnot know what is the French for fer, and ferret, and firk.\"\r\n\r\nSuch, in his outward aspects, is Burton; but of him, even more than of most\r\nwriters, it may be said that a brick of the house is no sample. Only by\r\nreading him in the proper sense, and that with diligence, can his great\r\nlearning, his singular wit and fancy, and the general view of life and of\r\nthings belonging to life, which informs and converts to a whole his\r\nlearning, his wit, and his fancy alike, be properly conceived. For reading\r\neither continuous or desultory, either grave or gay, at all times of life\r\nand in all moods of temper, there are few authors who stand the test of\r\npractice so well as the author of _The Anatomy of Melancholy_.\r\n\r\nProbably, however, among those who can taste old authors, there will always\r\nbe a friendly but irreconcilable difference as to the merits of Fuller and\r\nBurton, when compared together. There never can be any among such as to the\r\nmerits of Fuller, considered in himself. Like Burton, he was a clerk in\r\norders; but his literary practice, though more copious than that of the\r\nauthor of _The Anatomy_, divorced him less from the discharge of his\r\nprofessional duties. He was born, like Dryden, but twenty-two years\r\nearlier, in 1608, at Aldwinkle in Northamptonshire, and in a parsonage\r\nthere, but of the other parish (for there are two close together). He was\r\neducated at Cambridge, and, being made prebendary of Salisbury, and vicar\r\nof Broadwindsor, almost as soon as he could take orders, seemed to be in a\r\nfair way of preferment. He worked as a parish priest up to 1640, the year\r\nof the beginning of troubles, and the year of his first important book,\r\n_The Holy War_. But he was a staunch Royalist, though by no means a bigot,\r\nand he did not, like other men of his time, see his way to play Mr.\r\nFacing-both-ways. For a time he was a preacher in London, then he followed\r\nthe camp as chaplain to the victorious army of Hopton, in the west, then\r\nfor a time again he was stationary at Exeter, and after the ruin of the\r\nRoyal cause he returned to London, where, though he did not recover his\r\nbenefices, he was leniently treated, and even, in 1655, obtained license to\r\npreach. Nevertheless, the Restoration would probably have brought him\r\npromotion, but he lived not long enough to receive it, dying on the 15th of\r\nAugust 1661. He was an extremely industrious writer, publishing, besides\r\nthe work already mentioned, and not a few minor pieces (_The Holy and\r\nProfane State_, _Thoughts and Contemplations in Good, Worse, and Better\r\nTimes_, _A Pisgah-sight of Palestine_), an extensive _Church History of\r\nBritain_, and, after his death, what is perhaps his masterpiece, _The\r\nWorthies of England_, an extraordinary miscellany, quartering the ground by\r\ncounties, filling, in the compactest edition, two mighty quartos, and\r\ncontaining perhaps the greatest account of miscellaneous fact to be found\r\nanywhere out of an encyclopedia, conveyed in a style the quaintest and most\r\nlively to be found anywhere out of the choicest essayists of the language.\r\n\r\nA man of genius who adored Fuller, and who owes to him more than to any one\r\nelse except Sir Thomas Browne, has done, in small compass, a service to his\r\nmemory which is not easily to be paralleled. Lamb's specimens from Fuller,\r\nmost of which are only two or three lines long, and none a pageful, for\r\nonce contradict the axiom quoted above as to a brick and a house. So\r\nperfectly has the genius of selector and author coincided, that not having\r\nmyself gone through the verification of them, I should hardly be surprised\r\nto find that Lamb had used his faculty of invention. Yet this would not\r\nmatter, for they are perfectly Fullerian. Although Fuller has justly been\r\npraised for his method, and although he never seems to have suffered his\r\nfancy to run away with him to the extent of forgetting or wilfully\r\nmisrepresenting a fact, the conceits, which are the chief characteristic of\r\nhis style, are comparatively independent of the subject. Coleridge has\r\nasserted that \"Wit was the stuff and substance of his intellect,\" an\r\nassertion which (with all the respect due to Coleridge) would have been\r\nbetter phrased in some such way as this,--that nearly the whole force of\r\nhis intellect concentrated itself upon the witty presentation of things. He\r\nis illimitably figurative, and though his figures seldom or never fail to\r\ncarry illumination of the subject with them, their peculiar character is\r\nsufficiently indicated by the fact that they can almost always be separated\r\nfrom the subject and from the context in which they occur without any\r\ndamage to their own felicity. To a thoroughly serious person, to a person\r\nlike Lord Chesterfield (who was indeed very serious in his own way, and\r\nabhorred proverbial philosophy), or to one who cannot away with the\r\nintroduction of a quip in connection with a solemn subject, and who thinks\r\nthat indulgence in a gibe is a clear proof that the writer has no solid\r\nargument to produce, Fuller must be nothing but a puzzle or a disgust. That\r\na pious and earnest divine should, even in that day of quaintness, compare\r\nthe gradual familiarisation of Christians with the sacraments of the Church\r\nto the habit of children first taking care of, and then neglecting a pair\r\nof new boots, or should describe a brother clerk as \"pronouncing the word\r\n_damn_ with such an emphasis as left a dismal echo in his auditors' ears a\r\ngood while longer,\" seems, no doubt, to some excellent people,\r\nunpardonable, and almost incomprehensible. Yet no one has ever impeached\r\nthe sincerity of Fuller's convictions, and the blamelessness of his life.\r\nThat a grave historian should intersperse the innumerable trivialities of\r\nthe _Worthies_ may be only less shocking. But he was an eminent proof of\r\nhis own axiom, \"That an ounce of mirth, with the same degree of grace, will\r\nserve God farther than a pound of sadness.\" Fuller is perhaps the only\r\nwriter who, voluminous as he is, will not disappoint the most superficial\r\ninquirer for proofs of the accuracy of the character usually given to him.\r\nNobody perhaps but himself, in trying to make the best of the Egyptian\r\nbondage of the Commonwealth, would have discovered that the Church, being\r\nunrepresented by any of the four hundred and odd members of Cromwell's\r\nParliament, was better off than when she had Archbishops, Bishops, and a\r\nconvocation all to herself, urging, \"what civil Christian would not plead\r\nfor a dumb man,\" and so enlisting all the four hundred and odd enemies as\r\nfriends and representatives. But it is impossible to enter fully on the\r\nsubject of Fuller's quips. What may fairly be said of them is, that while\r\nconstantly fantastic, and sometimes almost childish, they are never really\r\nsilly; that they are never, or hardly ever in bad taste; and that, quaint\r\nand far fetched as they are, there is almost always some application or\r\nsuggestion which saves them from being mere intellectual somersaults. The\r\nfamous one of the \"Images of God cut in ebony,\" is sufficient of itself to\r\nserve as a text. There is in it all the good side of the emancipation\r\npropaganda with an entire freedom from the extravagance, the vulgarity, the\r\ninjustice, the bad taste which marked that propaganda a century and more\r\nafterwards, when taken up by persons very different from Fuller. Perhaps it\r\nmay be well to give an extract of some length from him:--\r\n\r\n     \"A lady big with child was condemned to perpetual imprisonment,\r\n     and in the dungeon was delivered of a son, who continued with her\r\n     till a boy of some bigness. It happened at one time he heard his\r\n     mother (for see neither of them could, as to decern in so dark a\r\n     place) bemoan her condition.\r\n\r\n     \"Why, mother (said the child) do you complain, seeing you want\r\n     nothing you can wish, having clothes, meat, and drink sufficient?\r\n     Alas! child (returned the mother), I lack liberty, converse with\r\n     Christians, the light of the sun, and many things more, which\r\n     thou, being prison-born, neither art nor can be sensible of in\r\n     thy condition.\r\n\r\n     \"The _post-nati_, understand thereby such striplings born in\r\n     England since the death of monarchy therein, conceive this land,\r\n     their mother, to be in a good estate. For one fruitful harvest\r\n     followeth another, commodities are sold at reasonable rates,\r\n     abundance of brave clothes are worn in the city, though not by\r\n     such persons whose birth doth best become, but whose purses can\r\n     best bestow them.\r\n\r\n     \"But their mother, England, doth justly bemoan the sad difference\r\n     betwixt her present and former condition; when she enjoyed full\r\n     and free trade without payment of taxes, save so small they\r\n     seemed rather an acknowledgment of their allegiance than a burden\r\n     to their estate; when she had the court of a king, the House of\r\n     Lords, yea, and the Lord's house, decently kept, constantly\r\n     frequented, without falsehood in doctrine, or faction in\r\n     discipline. God of His goodness restore unto us so much of these\r\n     things as may consist with His glory and our good.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"I saw a servant maid, at the command of her mistress, make,\r\n     kindle, and blow a fire. Which done, she was posted away about\r\n     other business, whilst her mistress enjoyed the benefit of the\r\n     fire. Yet I observed that this servant, whilst industriously\r\n     employed in the kindling thereof, got a more general, kindly, and\r\n     continuing heat than her mistress herself. Her heat was only by\r\n     her, and not in her, staying with her no longer than she stayed\r\n     by the chimney; whilst the warmth of the maid was inlaid, and\r\n     equally diffused through the whole body.\r\n\r\n     \"An estate suddenly gotten is not so lasting to the owner thereof\r\n     as what is duly got by industry. The substance of the diligent,\r\n     saith Solomon, Prov. xii. 27, is precious. He cannot be counted\r\n     poor that hath so many pearls, precious brown bread, precious\r\n     small beer, precious plain clothes, etc. A comfortable\r\n     consideration in this our age, wherein many hands have learned\r\n     their lesson of labour, who were neither born nor bred with it.\"\r\n\r\nThe best judges have admitted that, in contradistinction to this perpetual\r\nquipping, which is, as far as it goes, of his time, the general style of\r\nFuller is on the whole rather more modern than the styles of his\r\ncontemporaries. It does not seem that this is due to deliberate intention\r\nof shortening and proportioning his prose; for he is as careless as any\r\none of the whole century about exact grammatical sequence, and seems to\r\nhave had no objection on any critical grounds to the long disjointed\r\nsentence which was the curse of the time. But his own ruling passion\r\ninsensibly disposed him to a certain brevity. He liked to express his\r\nfigurative conceits pointedly and antithetically; and point and antithesis\r\nare the two things most incompatible with clauses jointed _ad infinitum_ in\r\nClarendon's manner, with labyrinths of \"whos\" and \"whiches\" such as too\r\nfrequently content Milton and Taylor. Poles asunder from Hobbes, not merely\r\nin his ultimate conclusions but in the general quality of his mind, he\r\nperhaps comes nearest to the author of the treatise on _Human Nature_ in\r\nclear, sensible, unambiguous presentation of the thing that he means to\r\nsay; and this, joined to his fecundity in illustration of every kind,\r\ngreatly helps the readableness of his books. No work of his as a working\r\nout of an original conception can compete with _The Anatomy of Melancholy_;\r\nbut he is as superior in minor method to Burton as he is inferior in\r\ngeneral grasp.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the minor Carolines must be dismissed rapidly. A not\r\nunimportant position among the prose writers of this time is occupied by\r\nEdward Herbert, Lord Herbert of Cherbury, the elder brother of George\r\nHerbert the poet. He was born in 1583, and finished his life ingloriously,\r\nand indeed discreditably, during the troubles of the civil war, on the 20th\r\nof August 1648. His earlier career is elaborately if not exactly truthfully\r\nrecorded in his _Autobiography_, and its details have been carefully\r\nsupplemented by his latest editor, Mr. Lee. His literary activity was\r\nvarious and considerable. His greatest work--a treatise which has been\r\nrashly called the foundation of English deism, but which rather expresses\r\nthe vague and not wholly unorthodox doubt expressed earlier by Montaigne,\r\nand by contemporaries of Herbert's own, such as La Mothe le Vayer--was\r\nwritten in Latin, and has never been translated into English. He was an\r\nEnglish verse writer of some merit, though inferior to his brother. His\r\nambitious and academic _History of Henry VIII._ is a regular and not\r\nunsuccessful effort in English prose, prompted no doubt by the\r\nthoroughgoing courtiership which ranks with his vanity and want of\r\nstability on the most unfavourable aspect of Herbert's character. But\r\nposterity has agreed to take him as an English writer chiefly on the\r\nstrength of the Autobiography, which remained in manuscript for a century\r\nand more, and was published by Horace Walpole, rather against the will of\r\nLord Powis, its possessor and its author's representative. It is difficult\r\nto say that Lord Powis was wrong, especially considering that Herbert never\r\npublished these memoirs, and seems to have written them as much as anything\r\nelse for his own private satisfaction. It may be doubted whether there is\r\nany more astounding monument of coxcombry in literature. Herbert is\r\nsometimes cited as a model of a modern knight-errant, of an Amadis born too\r\nlate. Certainly, according to his own account, all women loved and all men\r\nfeared him; but for the former fact we have nothing but his own authority,\r\nand in regard to the latter we have counter evidence which renders it\r\nexceedingly doubtful. He was, according to his own account, a desperate\r\nduellist. But even by this account his duels had a curious habit of being\r\ninterrupted, in the immortal phrase of Mr. Winkle, by \"several police\r\nconstables;\" while in regard to actual war the exploits of his youth seem\r\nnot to have been great, and those of his age were wholly discreditable,\r\ninasmuch as being by profession an ardent Royalist, he took the first\r\nopportunity to make, without striking a blow, a profitable composition with\r\nthe Parliament. Nevertheless, despite the drawbacks of subject-matter, the\r\nautobiography is a very interesting piece of English prose. The narrative\r\nstyle, for all its coxcombry and its insistence on petty details, has a\r\nsingular vivacity; the constructions, though sometimes incorrect (\"the\r\nedict was so severe as they who transgressed were to lose their heads\"),\r\nare never merely slovenly; and the writer displays an art, very uncommon in\r\nhis time, in the alternation of short and long sentences and the general\r\nadjustment of the paragraph. Here and there, too, there are passages of\r\nmore elevated style which give reason for regretting that the _De Veritate_\r\nwas not written in English. It is very much to be feared that the chief\r\nreason for its being written in Latin was a desire on the author's part to\r\nescape awkward consequences by an appearance of catering for philosophers\r\nand the learned only. It must be admitted that neither of the two great\r\nfree-thinking Royalists, Hobbes and Herbert, is a wholly pleasant\r\ncharacter; but it may be at least said for the commoner (it cannot be said\r\nfor the peer) that he was constant to his principles, and that if somewhat\r\ncareful of his skin, he never seems to have been tempted to barter his\r\nconscience for it as Herbert did.\r\n\r\nHardly any other writer among the minor Caroline prosaists is important\r\nenough to justify a substantive notice in a work which has already reached\r\nand almost exceeded the limits accorded to it. The excellent style of\r\nCowley's _Essays_, which is almost more modern than the work of Dryden and\r\nTillotson, falls in great part actually beyond the limits of our time; and\r\nby character, if not by date, Cowley is left for special treatment in the\r\nfollowing volume. He sometimes relapses into what may be called the general\r\nqualities with their accompanying defects of Elizabethan prose--a contempt\r\nof proportion, clearness, and order; a reckless readiness to say everything\r\nthat is in the writer's mind, without considering whether it is appropriate\r\nor not; a confusion of English and classical grammar, and occasionally a\r\nvery scant attention even to rules which the classical grammars indicate\r\nyet more sternly than the vernacular. But as a rule he is distinguished for\r\nexactly the opposite of all these things. Much less modern than Cowley, but\r\nstill of a chaster and less fanciful style than most of his contemporaries,\r\nis the famous Protestant apologist, Chillingworth--a man whose orderly mind\r\nand freedom from anything like enthusiasm reflected themselves in the easy\r\nbalance of his style. Sanderson, Pearson, Baxter, the two former luminaries\r\nof the Church, the latter one of the chief literary lights of\r\nNonconformity, belong more or less to the period, as does Bishop Hall.\r\nBaxter is the most colloquial, the most fanciful, and the latest, of the\r\nthree grouped together; the other two are nearer to the plainness of\r\nChillingworth than to the ornateness of Jeremy Taylor. Few English prose\r\nwriters again are better known than Izaak Walton, though it might be\r\ndifficult to prove that in matter of pure literature he stands very high.\r\nThe engaging character of his subjects, and the still more engaging display\r\nof his own temper and mode of thought which he makes in almost every\r\nsentence, both of his _Complete Angler_ and of his hardly less known\r\n_Lives_, account for the survival and constant popularity of books which\r\nare neither above nor below the better work of their time in literary form.\r\nWalton was born in 1593 and died ninety years later. His early manhood was\r\nspent in London as a \"linen-draper,\" but in friendly conversation with the\r\nbest clerical and literary society. In 1643 he retired from London to avoid\r\nthe bustle of the Civil War, and the _Complete Angler_ appeared in 1653.\r\nAnother writer contemporary with Walton, though less long-lived, James\r\nHowell, has been the subject of very varying judgments; his appeal being\r\nvery much of the same kind as Walton's, but addressed to a different and\r\nnarrower class of persons. He was born in 1594(?) of a fair Welsh family,\r\nwas educated at Jesus College, Oxford, was employed more than once on\r\nconfidential business errands on the Continent, entered Parliament, was\r\nmade Clerk of the Council, was imprisoned for years in the Fleet during the\r\nCivil War, received at the Restoration the post of Historiographer, and\r\ndied in 1666. He wrote all manner of things, but has chiefly survived as\r\nthe author of a large collection of Familiar Letters, which have been great\r\nfavourites with some excellent judges. They have something of the agreeable\r\ngarrulousness of Walton. But Howell was not only much more of a gossip than\r\nIzaak; he was also a good deal of a coxcomb, while Walton was destitute of\r\neven a trace of coxcombry. In one, however, as in the other, the attraction\r\nof matter completely outdoes the purely literary attraction. The reader is\r\nglad to hear at first hand what men thought of Raleigh's execution; how\r\nBen Jonson behaved in his cups; how foreign parts looked to a genuine\r\nEnglish traveller early in the seventeenth century, and so forth. Moreover,\r\nthe book was long a very popular one, and an unusual number of anecdotes\r\nand scraps passed from it into the general literary stock of English\r\nwriters. But Howell's manner of telling his stories is not extraordinarily\r\nattractive, and has something self-conscious and artificial about it which\r\ndetracts from its interest. The _Characters_ of Overbury were followed and,\r\nno doubt, imitated by John Earle, afterwards Bishop of Salisbury, and a man\r\nof some importance. Earle, who was a fellow of Merton, called his sketches\r\n_Microcosmography_. Nothing in them approaches the celebrated if perhaps\r\nnot quite genuine milkmaid of Overbury; but they give evidence of a good\r\ndeal of direct observation often expressed in a style that is pointed, such\r\nas the description of a bowling green as a place fitted for \"the expense of\r\ntime, money, and oaths.\" The church historian and miscellanist Heylin\r\nbelongs also to the now fast multiplying class of professional writers who\r\ndealt with almost any subject as it might seem likely to hit the taste of\r\nthe public. The bold and fantastic speculations of Bishop Wilkins and Sir\r\nKenelm Digby, and the _Oceana_ or Ideal Republic (last of a long line) of\r\nJames Harrington (not to be confounded with the earlier Sir John Harington,\r\ntranslator of Ariosto), deserve some notice. The famous _Eikon Basilike_\r\n(the authorship of which has perhaps of late years been too confidently\r\nascribed to Dr. Gauden independently, rather than to the king, edited by\r\nGauden) has considerable literary merit. Last of all has to be mentioned a\r\ncurious book, which made some noise at its appearance, and which, though\r\nnot much read now, has had two seasons of genuine popularity, and is still\r\nhighly thought of by a few good judges. This is the _Resolves_ of Owen\r\nFeltham or Felltham. Not much is known of the author except that he was of\r\na respectable family in East Anglia, a family which seems to have been\r\nespecially seated in the neighbourhood of Lowestoft. Besides the _Resolves_\r\nhe wrote some verse, of which the most notable piece is a reply to Ben\r\nJonson's famous ode to himself (\"Come Leave the Loathed Stage\")--a reply\r\nwhich even such a sworn partisan as Gifford admits to be at least just if\r\nnot very kind. Felltham seems also to have engaged in controversy with\r\nanother Johnson, a Jesuit, on theological subjects. But save for the\r\n_Resolves_ he would be totally forgotten. The estimate of their value will\r\ndiffer very much, as the liking for not very original discussion of ethical\r\nsubjects and sound if not very subtle judgment on them overpowers or not in\r\nthe reader a distaste for style that has no particular distinction, and\r\nideas which, though often wholesome, are seldom other than obvious.\r\nWordsworth's well-known description of one of his own poems, as being \"a\r\nchain of extremely valuable thoughts,\" applies no doubt to the _Resolves_,\r\nwhich, except in elegance, rather resemble the better-known of Cicero's\r\nphilosophical works. Moreover, though possessing no great elegance, they\r\nare not inelegant; though it is difficult to forget how differently Bacon\r\nand Browne treated not dissimilar subjects at much the same time. So\r\npopular were they that besides the first edition (which is undated, but\r\nmust have appeared in or before 1628, the date of the second), eleven\r\nothers were called for up to 1709. But it was not for a hundred years that\r\nthey were again printed, and then the well-meaning but misguided zeal of\r\ntheir resuscitator led him not merely to modernise their spelling, etc. (a\r\nvenial sin, if, which I am not inclined very positively to lay down, it is\r\na sin at all), but to \"improve\" their style, sense, and sentiment by\r\nomission, alteration, and other tamperings with the text, so as to give the\r\nreader not what Mr. Felltham wrote early in the seventeenth century, but\r\nwhat Mr. Cummings thought he ought to have written early in the nineteenth.\r\n\r\nThis chapter might easily be enlarged, and indeed, as Dryden says, shame\r\nmust invade the breast of every writer of literary history on a small scale\r\nwho is fairly acquainted with his subject, when he thinks how many worthy\r\nmen--men much worthier than he can himself ever pretend to be--he has\r\nperforce omitted. Any critic inclined to find fault may ask me where is the\r\never-memorable John Hales? Where is Tom Coryat, that most egregious\r\nOdcombian? and Barnabee of the unforgotten, though scandalous, Itinerary?\r\nWhere is Sir Thomas Urquhart, quaintest of cavaliers, and not least\r\nadmirable of translators, who not only rendered Rabelais in a style worthy\r\nof him, who not only wrote in sober seriousness pamphlets with titles,\r\nwhich Master Francis could hardly have bettered in jest, but who composed a\r\npedigree of the Urquhart family _nominatim_ up to Noah and Adam, and then\r\nimprovised chimney pieces in Cromarty Castle, commemorating the prehistoric\r\nancestors whom he had excogitated? Where are the great Bishops from\r\nAndrewes and Cosin onwards, and the lesser Theologians who wrangled, and\r\nthe Latitudinarians who meditated, and the historians with Whitelocke at\r\ntheir head, and the countless writers of countless classes of books who\r\nmultiplied steadily as time went on? It can only be answered that they are\r\nnot, and that almost in the nature of things they cannot be here. It is not\r\nthat they are not intrinsically interesting; it is not merely that, being\r\nless intrinsically interesting than some of their forerunners or\r\ncontemporaries, they must give way when room is limited. It is that even if\r\ntheir individual performance were better than that of earlier men, even if\r\nthere were room and verge enough for them, they would less concern the\r\nliterary historian. For to him in all cases the later examples of a style\r\nare less important than the earlier, merely because they are late, because\r\nthey have had forerunners whom, consciously or unconsciously, they have\r\n(except in the case of a great genius here and there) imitated, and because\r\nas a necessary consequence they fall into the _numerus_--into the gross as\r\nthey would themselves have said--who must be represented only by choice\r\nexamples and not enumerated or criticised in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nA conclusion, like a preface, is perhaps to some extent an old-fashioned\r\nthing; and it is sometimes held that a writer does better not to sum up at\r\nall, but to leave the facts which he has accumulated to make their own way\r\ninto the intelligence of his readers. I am not able to accept this view of\r\nthe matter. In dealing with such a subject as that which has been handled\r\nin the foregoing pages, it is at least as necessary that the writer should\r\nhave something of _ensemble_ in his mind as that he should look carefully\r\ninto facts and dates and names. And he can give no such satisfactory\r\nevidence of his having possessed this _ensemble_, as a short summary of\r\nwhat, in his idea, the whole period looks like when taken at a bird's-eye\r\nview. For he has (or ought to have) given the details already; and his\r\nsummary, without in the least compelling readers to accept it, must give\r\nthem at least some means of judging whether he has been wandering over a\r\nplain trackless to him, or has been pursuing with confidence a well-planned\r\nand well-laid road.\r\n\r\nAt the time at which our period begins (and which, though psychological\r\nepochs rarely coincide exactly with chronological, is sufficiently\r\ncoincident with the accession of Elizabeth), it cannot be said with any\r\nprecision that there was an English _literature_ at all. There were eminent\r\nEnglish writers, though perhaps one only to whom the first rank could even\r\nby the utmost complaisance be opened or allowed. But there was no\r\nliterature, in the sense of a system of treating all subjects in the\r\nvernacular, according to methods more or less decidedly arranged and\r\naccepted by a considerable tradition of skilled craftsmen. Something of the\r\nkind had partially existed in the case of the Chaucerian poetic; but it was\r\nan altogether isolated something. Efforts, though hardly conscious ones,\r\nhad been made in the domain of prose by romancers, such as the practically\r\nunknown Thomas Mallory, by sacred orators like Latimer, by historians like\r\nMore, by a few struggling miscellaneous writers. Men like Ascham, Cheke,\r\nWilson, and others had, perhaps with a little touch of patronage,\r\nrecommended the regular cultivation of the English tongue; and immediately\r\nbefore the actual accession of Elizabeth the publication of Tottel's\r\n_Miscellany_ had shown by its collection of the best poetical work of the\r\npreceding half century the extraordinary effect which a judicious xenomania\r\n(if I may, without scaring the purists of language, borrow that useful word\r\nfrom the late Karl Hillebrand) may produce on English. It is to the\r\nexceptional fertilising power of such influences on our stock that we owe\r\nall the marvellous accomplishments of the English tongue, which in this\r\nrespect--itself at the head of the Teutonic tongues by an almost\r\nunapproachable distance--stands distinguished with its Teutonic sisters\r\ngenerally from the groups of languages with which it is most likely to be\r\ncontrasted. Its literary power is originally less conspicuous than that of\r\nthe Celtic and of the Latin stocks; the lack, notorious to this day, of one\r\nsingle original English folk-song of really great beauty is a rough and\r\ngeneral fact which is perfectly borne out by all other facts. But the\r\nexquisite folk-literature of the Celts is absolutely unable either by\r\nitself or with the help of foreign admixture to arrive at complete literary\r\nperfection. And the profound sense of form which characterises the Latins\r\nis apparently accompanied by such a deficiency of originality, that when\r\nany foreign model is accepted it receives hardly any colour from the native\r\ngenius, and remains a cultivated exotic. The less promising soil of\r\nAnglo-Saxon idiom waited for the foreign influences, ancient and modern, of\r\nthe Renaissance to act upon it, and then it produced a crop which has\r\ndwarfed all the produce of the modern world, and has nearly, if not quite,\r\nequalled in perfection, while it has much exceeded in bulk and length of\r\nflowering time, the produce of Greece.\r\n\r\nThe rush of foreign influences on the England of Elizabeth's time,\r\nstimulated alike by the printing press, by religious movements, by the\r\nrevival of ancient learning, and by the habits of travel and commerce, has\r\nnot been equalled in force and volume by anything else in history. But the\r\ndifferent influences of different languages and countries worked with very\r\ndifferent force. To the easier and more generally known of the classical\r\ntongues must be assigned by far the largest place. This was only natural at\r\na time when to the inherited and not yet decayed use of colloquial and\r\nfamiliar Latin as the vehicle of business, of literature, and of almost\r\neverything that required the committal of written words to paper, was added\r\nthe scholarly study of its classical period from the strictly humanist\r\npoint of view. If we could assign marks in the competition, Latin would\r\nhave to receive nearly as many as all its rivals put together; but Greek\r\nwould certainly not be second, though it affected, especially in the\r\nchannel of the Platonic dialogues, many of the highest and most gifted\r\nsouls. In the latter part of the present period there were probably\r\nscholars in England who, whether their merely philological attainments\r\nmight or might not pass muster now, were far better read in the actual\r\nliterature of the Greek classics than the very philologists who now disdain\r\nthem. Not a few of the chief matters in Greek literature--the epical\r\ngrandeur of Homer, the tragic principles of the three poets, and so\r\nforth--made themselves, at first or second hand, deeply felt. But on the\r\nwhole Greek did not occupy the second place. That place was occupied by\r\nItalian. It was Italy which had touched the spring that let loose the\r\npoetry of Surrey and Wyatt; Italy was the chief resort of travelled\r\nEnglishmen in the susceptible time of youth; Italy provided in Petrarch\r\n(Dante was much less read) and Boccaccio, in Ariosto and Tasso, an\r\ninexhaustible supply of models, both in prose and verse. Spain was only\r\nless influential because Spanish literature was in a much less finished\r\ncondition than Italian, and perhaps also because political causes made the\r\nfollowing of Spaniards seem almost unpatriotic. Yet the very same causes\r\nmade the Spanish language itself familiar to far more Englishmen than are\r\nfamiliar with it now, though the direct filiation of euphuism on Spanish\r\noriginals is no doubt erroneous, and though the English and Spanish dramas\r\nevolved themselves in lines rather parallel than connected.\r\n\r\nFrance and Germany were much (indeed infinitely) less influential, and the\r\nfact is from some points of view rather curious. Both were much nearer to\r\nEngland than Spain or Italy; there was much more frequent communication\r\nwith both; there was at no time really serious hostility with either; and\r\nthe genius of both languages was, the one from one side, the other from the\r\nother, closely connected with that of English. Yet in the great productions\r\nof our great period, the influence of Germany is only perceptible in some\r\nburlesque matter, such as _Eulenspiegel_ and _Grobianus_, in the furnishing\r\nof a certain amount of supernatural subject-matter like the Faust legend,\r\nand in details less important still. French influence is little greater; a\r\nfew allusions of \"E. K.\" to Marot and Ronsard; a few translations and\r\nimitations by Spenser, Watson, and others; the curious sonnets of\r\n_Zepheria_; a slight echo of Rabelais here and there; some adapted songs to\r\nmusic; and a translated play or two on the Senecan model.[68]\r\n\r\n[68] Some, like my friend Mr. Lee, would demur to this, especially as\r\nregards the sonnet. But Desportes, the chief creditor alleged, was himself\r\nan infinite borrower from the Italians. Soothern, an early but worthless\r\nsonneteer, _c._ 1584, did certainly imitate the French.\r\n\r\nBut France had already exercised a mighty influence upon England; and\r\nGermany had very little influence to exercise for centuries. Putting aside\r\nall pre-Chaucerian influence which may be detected, the outside guiding\r\nforce of literary English literature (which was almost exclusively poetry)\r\nhad been French from the end of the fourteenth century to the last\r\nsurvivals of the Scoto-Chaucerian school in Hawes, Skelton, and Lindsay.\r\nTrue, France had now something else to give; though it must be remembered\r\nthat her great school coincided with rather than preceded the great school\r\nof England, that the _Defense et Illustration de la Langue Francaise_ was\r\nbut a few years anterior to Tottel's _Miscellany_, and that, except Marot\r\nand Rabelais (neither of whom was neglected, though neither exercised much\r\nformal influence), the earlier French writers of the sixteenth century had\r\nnothing to teach England. On the other hand, Germany was utterly unable to\r\nsupply anything in the way of instruction in literary form; and it was\r\ninstruction in literary form which was needed to set the beanstalk of\r\nEnglish literature growing even unto the heavens. Despite the immense\r\nadvantage which the English adoption of German innovations in religion gave\r\nthe country of Luther, that country's backwardness made imitation\r\nimpossible. Luther himself had not elaborated anything like a German style;\r\nhe had simply cleared the vernacular of some of its grossest\r\nstumbling-blocks and started a good plain fashion of sentence. That was not\r\nwhat England wanted or was likely to want, but a far higher literary\r\ninstruction, which Germany could not give her and (for the matter of that)\r\nhas never been in a position to give her. The models which she sought had\r\nto be sought elsewhere, in Athens, in old Rome, in modern Tuscany.\r\n\r\nBut it would probably be unwise not to make allowance for a less\r\ncommonplace and more \"metaphysical\" explanation. It was precisely because\r\nFrench and German had certain affinities with English, while Italian and\r\nSpanish, not to mention the classical tongues, were strange and exotic,\r\nthat the influence of the latter group was preferred. The craving for\r\nsomething not familiar, for something new and strange, is well known enough\r\nin the individual; and nations are, after all, only aggregates of\r\nindividuals. It was exactly because the models of the south were so utterly\r\ndivided from the isolated Briton in style and character that he took so\r\nkindly to them, and that their study inspired him so well. There were not,\r\nindeed, wanting signs of what mischief might have been done if English\r\nsense had been less robust and the English genius of a less stubborn\r\nidiosyncrasy. Euphuism, the occasional practice of the Senecan drama, the\r\npreposterous and almost incredible experiments in classical metre of men\r\nnot merely like Drant and Harvey, but like Sidney and Spenser, were\r\nsufficiently striking symptoms of the ferment which was going on in the\r\nliterary constitution of the country. But they were only harmless\r\nheat-rashes, not malignant distempers, and the spirit of England won\r\nthrough them, with no loss of general health, probably with the result of\r\nthe healthy excretion of many peccant humours which might have been\r\nmischievous if driven in. Even the strongest of all the foreign forces, the\r\njust admiration of the masterpieces of classical antiquity, was not in any\r\nway hurtful; and it is curious enough that it is only in what may be called\r\nthe autumn and, comparatively speaking, the decadence of the period that\r\nanything that can be called pedantry is observed. It is in Milton and\r\nBrowne, not in Shakespere and Hooker, that there is an appearance of undue\r\ndomination and \"obsession\" by the classics.\r\n\r\nThe subdivisions of the period in which these purely literary influences\r\nworked in combination with those of the domestic and foreign policy of\r\nEngland (on which it is unnecessary here to dilate), can be drawn with\r\ntolerable precision. They are both better marked and more important in\r\nverse than in prose. For it cannot be too often asserted that the age, in\r\nthe wide sense, was, despite many notable achievements in the _sermo\r\npedestris_, not an age of prose but an age of poetry. The first period\r\nextends (taking literary dates) from the publication of Tottel's\r\n_Miscellany_ to that of _The Shepherd's Calendar_. It is not distinguished\r\nby much production of positive value. In poetry proper the writers pursue\r\nand exercise themselves upon the track of Surrey, Wyatt, and the other\r\nauthors whom Grimoald, or some other, collected; acquiring, no doubt, a\r\ncertain facility in the adjustment to iambic and other measures of the\r\naltered pronunciation since Chaucer's time; practising new combinations in\r\nstanza, but inclining too much to the doggerel Alexandrines and\r\nfourteeners (more doggerel still when chance or design divided them into\r\neights and sixes); repeating, without much variation, images and phrases\r\ndirectly borrowed from foreign models; and displaying, on the whole, a\r\nsingular lack of inspiration which half excuses the mistaken attempt of the\r\nyounger of them, and of their immediate successors, to arrive at the\r\ndesired poetical medium by the use of classical metres. Among men actually\r\nliving and writing at this time Lord Buckhurst alone displays a real\r\npoetical faculty. Nor is the case much better in respect of drama, though\r\nhere the restless variety of tentative displays even more clearly the\r\nvigorous life which underlay incomplete performance, and which promised\r\nbetter things shortly. The attempt of _Gorboduc_ and a few other plays to\r\nnaturalise the artificial tragedy, though a failure, was one of those\r\nfailures which, in the great literary \"rule of false,\" help the way to\r\nsuccess; the example of _Ralph Roister Doister_ and _Gammer Gurton's\r\nNeedle_ could not fail to stimulate the production of genuine native farce\r\nwhich might any day become _la bonne comedie_. And even the continued\r\ncomposition of Moralities showed signs of the growing desire for life and\r\nindividuality of character. Moreover, the intense and increasing liking for\r\nthe theatre in all classes of society, despite the discouragement of the\r\nauthorities, the miserable reward offered to actors and playwrights, and\r\nthe discredit which rested on the vocations of both, was certain in the\r\nordinary course of things to improve the supply. The third division of\r\nliterature made slower progress under less powerful stimulants. No\r\nemulation, like that which tempted the individual graduate or templar to\r\nrival Surrey in addressing his mistress's eyebrow, or Sackville in stately\r\nrhyming on English history, acted on the writers of prose. No public\r\ndemand, like that which produced the few known and the hundred forgotten\r\nplaywrights of the first half of Elizabeth's reign, served as a hotbed. But\r\nit is the great secret of prose that it can dispense with such stimulants.\r\nEverybody who wished to make his thoughts known began, with the help of\r\nthe printing press, to make them known; and the informal use of the\r\nvernacular, by dint of this unconscious practice and of the growing\r\nscholarship both of writers and readers, tended insensibly to make itself\r\nless of a mere written conversation and more of a finished prose style.\r\nPreaching in English, the prose pamphlet, and translations into the\r\nvernacular were, no doubt, the three great schoolmasters in the\r\ndisciplining of English prose. But by degrees all classes of subjects were\r\ntreated in the natural manner, and so the various subdivisions of prose\r\nstyle--oratorical, narrative, expository, and the rest--slowly evolved and\r\nseparated themselves, though hardly, even at the close of the time, had\r\nthey attained the condition of finish.\r\n\r\nThe year 1580 may be fixed on with almost mathematical accuracy as the date\r\nat which the great generation of Elizabethan writers first showed its hand\r\nwith Lyly's _Euphues_ in prose and Spenser's _Shepherd's Calendar_ in\r\nverse. Drama was a little, but not more than a little, later in showing the\r\nsame signs of rejuvenescence; and from that time forward till the end of\r\nthe century not a year passed without the appearance of some memorable work\r\nor writer; while the total production of the twenty years exceeds in\r\noriginality and force, if not always in artistic perfection of form, the\r\nproduction of any similar period in the world's history. The group of\r\nUniversity Wits, following the example of Lyly (who, however, in drama\r\nhardly belongs to the most original school), started the dramas of history,\r\nof romance, of domestic life; and, by fashioning through their leader\r\nMarlowe the tragic decasyllable, put into the hands of the still greater\r\ngroup who succeeded them an instrument, the power of which it is impossible\r\nto exaggerate. Before the close of the century they had themselves all\r\nceased their stormy careers; but Shakespere was in the full swing of his\r\nactivity; Ben Jonson had achieved the freshest and perhaps capital fruit of\r\nhis study of humours; Dekker, Webster, Middleton, Chapman, and a crowd of\r\nlesser writers had followed in his steps. In poetry proper the magnificent\r\nsuccess of _The Faerie Queen_ had in one sense no second; but it was\r\nsurrounded with a crowd of productions hardly inferior in their own way,\r\nthe chief being the result of the great and remarkable sonnet outburst of\r\nthe last decade of the century. The doggerel of the earlier years had\r\nalmost entirely disappeared, and in its place appeared the perfect\r\nconcerted music of the stanzas (from the sonnet and the Spenserian\r\ndownwards), the infinite variety of the decasyllable, and the exquisite\r\nlyric snatches of song in the dramatists, pamphleteers, and music-book\r\nwriters. Following the general law already indicated, the formal advance in\r\nprose was less, but an enormous stride was made in the direction of\r\napplying it to its various uses. The theologians, with Hooker at their\r\nhead, produced almost the first examples of the measured and dignified\r\ntreatment of argument and exposition. Bacon (towards the latter end it is\r\ntrue) produced the earliest specimens of his singular mixture of gravity\r\nand fancy, pregnant thought and quaint expression. History in the proper\r\nsense was hardly written, but a score of chroniclers, some not deficient in\r\nnarrative power, paved the way for future historians. In imaginative and\r\nmiscellaneous literature the fantastic extravagances of Lyly seemed as\r\nthough they might have an evil effect. In reality they only spurred\r\ningenious souls on to effort in refining prose, and in one particular\r\ndirection they had a most unlooked for result. The imitation in little by\r\nGreene, Lodge, and others, of their long-winded graces, helped to\r\npopularise the pamphlet, and the popularisation of the pamphlet led the way\r\nto periodical writing--an introduction perhaps of doubtful value in itself,\r\nbut certainly a matter of no small importance in the history of literature.\r\nAnd so by degrees professional men of letters arose--men of letters,\r\nprofessional in a sense, which had not existed since the days of the\r\ntravelling Jongleurs of the early Middle Ages. These men, by working for\r\nthe actors in drama, or by working for the publishers in the prose and\r\nverse pamphlet (for the latter form still held its ground), earned a\r\nsubsistence which would seem sometimes to have been not a mere pittance,\r\nand which at any rate, when folly and vice did not dissipate it, kept them\r\nalive. Much nonsense no doubt has been talked about the Fourth Estate; but\r\nsuch as it is, for good or for bad, it practically came into existence in\r\nthese prolific years.\r\n\r\nThe third period, that of vigorous manhood, may be said to coincide roughly\r\nwith the reign of James I., though if literary rather than political dates\r\nbe preferred, it might be made to begin with the death of Spenser in 1599,\r\nand to end with the damnation of Ben Jonson's _New Inn_ just thirty years\r\nlater. In the whole of this period till the very last there is no other\r\nsign of decadence than the gradual dropping off in the course of nature of\r\nthe great men of the preceding stage, not a few of whom, however, survived\r\ninto the next, while the places of those who fell were taken in some cases\r\nby others hardly below the greatest, such as Beaumont and Fletcher. Many of\r\nthe very greatest works of what is generally known as the Elizabethan\r\nera--the later dramas of Shakespere, almost the whole work of Ben Jonson,\r\nthe later poems of Drayton, Daniel, and Chapman, the plays of Webster and\r\nMiddleton, and the prose of Raleigh, the best work of Bacon, the poetry of\r\nBrowne and Wither--date from this time, while the astonishingly various and\r\nexcellent work of the two great dramatists above mentioned is wholly\r\ncomprised within it. And not only is there no sign of weakening, but there\r\nis hardly a sign of change. A slight, though only a slight, depression of\r\nthe imaginative and moral tone may be noticed or fancied in those who, like\r\nFletcher, are wholly of the period, and a certain improvement in general\r\ntechnical execution testifies to longer practice. But Webster might as well\r\nhave written years earlier (hardly so well years later) than he actually\r\ndid; and especially in the case of numerous anonymous or single works, the\r\ndate of which, or at least of their composition, is obscure, it is very\r\ndifficult from internal evidence of style and sentiment to assign them to\r\none date rather than to another, to the last part of the strictly\r\nElizabethan or the first part of the strictly Jacobean period. Were it not\r\nfor the occasional imitation of models, the occasional reference to dated\r\nfacts, it would be not so much difficult as impossible. If there seems to\r\nbe less audacity of experiment, less of the fire of youth, less of the\r\nunrestrainable restlessness of genius eager to burst its way, that, as has\r\nbeen already remarked of another difference, may not improbably be mainly\r\ndue to fancy, and to the knowledge that the later efforts actually were\r\nlater as to anything else. In prose more particularly there is no change\r\nwhatever. Few new experiments in style were tried, unless the _Characters_\r\nof Overbury and Earle may be called such. The miscellaneous pamphlets of\r\nthe time were written in much the same fashion, and in some cases by the\r\nsame men, as when, forty years before Jonson summoned himself to \"quit the\r\nloathed stage,\" Nash had alternately laughed at Gabriel Harvey, and\r\nsavagely lashed the Martinists. The graver writers certainly had not\r\nimproved upon, and had not greatly changed the style in which Hooker broke\r\nhis lance with Travers, or descanted on the sanctity of law. The\r\nhumour-comedy of Jonson, the romantic _drame_ of Fletcher, with the\r\nmarmoreally-finished minor poems of Ben, were the nearest approaches of any\r\nproduct of the time to novelty of general style, and all three were\r\ndestined to be constantly imitated, though only in the last case with much\r\nreal success, during the rest of our present period. Yet the\r\npost-Restoration comedy is almost as much due to Jonson and Fletcher as to\r\nforeign models, and the influence of both, after long failing to produce\r\nanything of merit, was not imperceptible even in Congreve and Vanbrugh.\r\n\r\nOf the fourth period, which practically covers the reign of Charles I. and\r\nthe interregnum of the Commonwealth, no one can say that it shows no signs\r\nof decadence, when the meaning of that word is calculated according to the\r\ncautions given above in noticing its poets. Yet the decadence is not at all\r\nof the kind which announces a long literary dead season, but only of that\r\nwhich shows that the old order is changing to a new. Nor if regard be\r\nmerely had to the great names which adorn the time, may it seem proper to\r\nuse the word decadence at all. To this period belong not only Milton, but\r\nTaylor, Browne, Clarendon, Hobbes (four of the greatest names in English\r\nprose), the strange union of learning in matter and quaintness in form\r\nwhich characterises Fuller and Burton, the great dramatic work of Massinger\r\nand Ford. To it also belongs the exquisite if sometimes artificial school\r\nof poetry which grew up under the joint inspiration of the great personal\r\ninfluence and important printed work of Ben Jonson on the one hand, and the\r\nsubtler but even more penetrating stimulant of the unpublished poetry of\r\nDonne on the other--a school which has produced lyrical work not surpassed\r\nby that of any other school or time, and which, in some specially poetical\r\ncharacteristics, may claim to stand alone.\r\n\r\nIf then, we speak of decadence, it is necessary to describe with some\r\nprecision what is meant, and to do so is not difficult, for the signs of it\r\nare evident, not merely in the rank and file of writers (though they are\r\nnaturally most prominent here), but to some extent in the great\r\nillustrations of the period themselves. In even the very best work of the\r\ntime there is a want of the peculiar freshness and spontaneity, as of\r\nspring water from the rock, which characterises earlier work. The art is\r\nconstantly admirable, but it is almost obtrusively art--a proposition which\r\nis universally true even of the greatest name of the time, of Milton, and\r\nwhich applies equally to Taylor and to Browne, to Massinger and to Ford,\r\nsometimes even to Herrick (extraordinary as is the grace which he manages\r\nto impart), and almost always to Carew. The lamp is seldom far off, though\r\nits odour may be the reverse of disagreeable. But in the work which is not\r\nquite so excellent, other symptoms appear which are as decisive and less\r\ntolerable. In the poetry of the time there appear, side by side with much\r\nexquisite melody and much priceless thought, the strangest blotches,\r\nalready more than once noticed, of doggerel, of conceits pushed to the\r\nverge of nonsense and over the verge of grotesque, of bad rhyme and bad\r\nrhythm which are evidently not the result of mere haste and creative\r\nenthusiasm but of absolutely defective ear, of a waning sense of harmony.\r\nIn the drama things are much worse. Only the two dramatists already\r\nmentioned, with the doubtful addition of Shirley, display anything like\r\ngreat or original talent. A few clever playwrights do their journey-work\r\nwith creditable craftsmanship. But even this characteristic is wanting in\r\nthe majority. The plots relapse into a chaos almost as great as that of the\r\ndrama of fifty years earlier, but with none of its excuse of inexperience\r\nand of redeeming purple patches. The characters are at once uninteresting\r\nand unpleasant; the measure hobbles and staggers; the dialogue varies\r\nbetween passages of dull declamation and passages of almost duller\r\nrepartee. Perhaps, though the prose names of the time are greater than\r\nthose of its dramatists, or, excluding Milton's, of its poets, the signs of\r\nsomething wrong are clearest in prose. It would be difficult to find in any\r\ngood prose writer between 1580 and 1625 shameless anomalies of arrangement,\r\nthe clumsy distortions of grammar, which the very greatest Caroline writers\r\npermit themselves in the intervals, and sometimes in the very course of\r\ntheir splendid eloquence; while, as for lesser men, the famous incoherences\r\nof Cromwell's speeches are hardly more than a caricature of the custom of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nSomething has yet to be said as to the general characteristics of this\r\ntime--characteristics which, scarcely discernible in the first period, yet\r\neven there to be traced in such work as that of Surrey and Sackville,\r\nemerge into full prominence in the next, continue with hardly any loss in\r\nthe third, and are discernible even in the \"decadence\" of the fourth. Even\r\nyet they are not universally recognised, and it appears to be sometimes\r\nthought that because critics speak with enthusiasm of periods in which,\r\nsave at rare intervals, and as it were by accident, they are not\r\ndiscernible at all, such critics are insensible to them where they occur.\r\nNever was there a grosser mistake. It is said that M. Taine, in private\r\nconversation, once said to a literary novice who rashly asked him whether\r\nhe liked this or that, \"Monsieur, en litterature j'aime tout.\" It was a\r\nnoble and correct sentiment, though it might be a little difficult for the\r\nparticular critic who formulated it to make good his claim to it as a\r\nmotto. The ideal critic undoubtedly does like everything in literature,\r\nprovided that it is good of its kind. He likes the unsophisticated\r\ntentatives of the earliest minstrel poetry, and the cultivated perfection\r\nof form of Racine and Pope; he likes the massive vigour of the French and\r\nEnglish sixteenth centuries, and the alembicated exquisiteness of Catullus\r\nand Carew; he does not dislike Webster because he is not Dryden, or Young\r\nbecause he is not Spenser; he does not quarrel with Sophocles because he is\r\nnot AEschylus, or with Hugo because he is not Heine. But at the same time it\r\nis impossible for him not to recognise that there are certain periods where\r\ninspiration and accomplishment meet in a fashion which may be sought for in\r\nvain at others. These are the great periods of literature, and there are\r\nperhaps only five of them, with five others which may be said to be almost\r\nlevel. The five first are the great age of Greek literature from AEschylus\r\nto Plato, the great ages of English and French literature in the sixteenth\r\nand seventeenth centuries, the whole range of Italian literature from Dante\r\nto Ariosto, and the second great age of English from the _Lyrical Ballads_\r\nto the death of Coleridge. It is the super-eminent glory of English that it\r\ncounts twice in the reckoning. The five seconds are the Augustan age of\r\nLatin, the short but brilliant period of Spanish literary development, the\r\nRomantic era in France, the age of Goethe in Germany, including Heine's\r\nearlier and best work, and (with difficulty, and by allowance chiefly of\r\nSwift and Dryden) the half century from the appearance of _Absalom and\r\nAchitophel_ to the appearance of _Gulliver_ and _The Dunciad_ in England.\r\nOut of these there are great men but no great periods, and the first class\r\nis distinguished from the second, not so much by the fact that almost all\r\nthe greatest literary names of the world are found in it, as because it is\r\nevident to a careful reader that there was more of the general spirit of\r\npoetry and of literature diffused in human brains at these times than at\r\nany other. It has been said more than once that English Elizabethan\r\nliterature may, and not merely in virtue of Shakespere, claim the first\r\nplace even among the first class. The full justification of this assertion\r\ncould only be given by actually going through the whole range of the\r\nliterature, book in hand. The foregoing pages have given it as it were in\r\n_precis_, rather than in any fuller fashion. And it has been thought better\r\nto devote some of the space permitted to extract as the only possible\r\nsubstitute for this continual book-in-hand exemplification. Many subjects\r\nwhich might properly form the subject of excursus in a larger history have\r\nbeen perforce omitted, the object being to give, not a series of\r\ninteresting essays on detached points, but a conspectus of the actual\r\nliterary progress and accomplishment of the century, from 1557 to 1660.\r\nSuch essays exist already in great numbers, though some no doubt are yet to\r\nwrite. The extraordinary influence of Plato, or at least of a more or less\r\nindistinctly understood Platonism, on many of the finer minds of the\r\nearlier and middle period, is a very interesting point, and it has been\r\nplausibly connected with the fact that Giordano Bruno was for some years a\r\nresident in England, and was acquainted with the Greville-Sidney circle at\r\nthe very time that that circle was almost the cradle of the new English\r\nliterature. The stimulus given not merely by the popular fancy for rough\r\ndramatic entertainments, but by the taste of courts and rich nobles for\r\nmasques--a taste which favoured the composition of such exquisite\r\nliterature as Ben Jonson's and Milton's masterpieces--is another side\r\nsubject of the same kind. I do not know that, much as has been written on\r\nthe Reformation, the direct influence of the form which the Reformation\r\ntook in England on the growth of English literature has ever been estimated\r\nand summarised fully and yet briefly, so as to show the contrast between\r\nthe distinctly anti-literary character of most of the foreign Protestant\r\nand the English Puritan movement on the one side, and the literary\r\ntendencies of Anglicanism on the other. The origins of Euphuism and of that\r\nlater form of preciousness which is sometimes called Gongorism and\r\nsometimes Marinism have been much discussed, but the last word has\r\ncertainly not been said on them. For these things, however (which are\r\nmerely quoted as examples of a very numerous class), there could be found\r\nno place here without excluding other things more centrally necessary to\r\nthe unfolding of the history. And therefore I may leave what I have written\r\nwith a short final indication of what seems to me the distinguishing mark\r\nof Elizabethan literature. That mark is not merely the presence of\r\nindividual works of the greatest excellence, but the diffusion throughout\r\nthe whole work of the time of a _vivida vis_, of flashes of beauty in prose\r\nand verse, which hardly any other period can show. Let us open one of the\r\nsongbooks of the time, Dowland's _Second Book of Airs_, published in the\r\ncentral year of our period, 1600, and reprinted by Mr Arber. Here almost at\r\nrandom we hit upon this snatch--\r\n\r\n    \"Come ye heavy states of night,\r\n    Do my father's spirit right;\r\n    Soundings baleful let me borrow,\r\n    Burthening my song with sorrow:\r\n    Come sorrow, come! Her eyes that sings\r\n    By thee, are turned into springs.\r\n\r\n    \"Come you Virgins of the night\r\n    That in dirges sad delight,\r\n    Quire my anthems; I do borrow\r\n    Gold nor pearl, but sounds of sorrow.\r\n    Come sorrow, come! Her eyes that sings\r\n    By thee, are turned into springs.\"\r\n\r\nIt does not matter who wrote that--the point is its occurrence in an\r\nordinary collection of songs to music neither better nor worse than many\r\nothers. When we read such verses as this, or as the still more charming\r\nAddress to Love given on page 122, there is evident at once the _non so\r\nche_ which distinguishes this period. There is a famous story of a\r\ngood-natured conversation between Scott and Moore in the latter days of Sir\r\nWalter, in which the two poets agreed that verse which would have made a\r\nfortune in their young days appeared constantly in magazines without being\r\nmuch regarded in their age. No sensible person will mistake the meaning of\r\nthe apparent praise. It meant that thirty years of remarkable original\r\nproduction and of much study of models had made possible and common a\r\nstandard of formal merit which was very rare at an earlier time. Now this\r\nstandard of formal merit undoubtedly did not generally exist in the days of\r\nElizabeth. But what did generally exist was the \"wind blowing where it\r\nlisteth,\" the presence and the influence of which are least likely to be\r\nmistaken or denied by those who are most strenuous in insisting on the\r\nimportance and the necessity of formal excellence itself. I once undertook\r\nfor several years the criticism of minor poetry for a literary journal,\r\nwhich gave more room than most to such things, and during the time I think\r\nI must have read through or looked over probably not much less than a\r\nthousand, certainly not less than five or six hundred volumes. I am\r\nspeaking with seriousness when I say that nothing like the note of the\r\nmerely casual pieces quoted or referred to above was to be detected in more\r\nthan at the outside two or three of these volumes, and that where it seemed\r\nto sound faintly some second volume of the same author's almost always came\r\nto smother it soon after. There was plenty of quite respectable poetic\r\nlearning: next to nothing of the poetic spirit. Now in the period dealt\r\nwith in this volume that spirit is everywhere, and so are its sisters, the\r\nspirits of drama and of prose. They may appear in full concentration and\r\nlustre, as in _Hamlet_ or _The Faerie Queene_; or in fitful and\r\nintermittent flashes, as in scores and hundreds of sonneteers,\r\npamphleteers, playwrights, madrigalists, preachers. But they are always not\r\nfar off. In reading other literatures a man may lose little by obeying the\r\nadvice of those who tell him only to read the best things: in reading\r\nElizabethan literature by obeying he can only disobey that advice, for the\r\nbest things are everywhere.[69]\r\n\r\n[69] In the twenty years which have passed since this book was first\r\npublished, monographs on most of the points indicated on p. 459 have\r\nappeared, both in England and America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--BIBLIOGRAPHICAL\r\n\r\nSingle plays, poems, etc., not mentioned in this Index will be found in the\r\ncollections referred to under the headings Arber, Bullen, Farmer, Grosart,\r\nHazlitt, Park, Simpson.\r\n\r\n  Alexander, Sir William. _See_ Stirling.\r\n\r\n  Arber, E., English Garner, vols. i.-viii., Birmingham and London,\r\n        1877-96.\r\n    _Also_ new editions in redistributed volumes by Lee, Collins,\r\n        and others.\r\n\r\n  Ascham, Roger, Toxophilus.
