G.H. MENDELL,\r\n\r\nCORPS OF TOPOGRAPHICAL ENGINEERS, U.S. ARMY,\r\n\r\nAND\r\n\r\nLieut. W.P. CRAIGHILL,\r\n\r\nCORPS OF ENGINEERS, U.S. ARMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginally published in 1862\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the execution of any undertaking there are extremes on either hand\r\nwhich are alike to be avoided. The rule holds in a special manner in\r\nmaking a translation. There is, on the one side, the extreme of too\r\nrigid adherence, word for word and line for line, to the original, and\r\non the other is the danger of using too free a pen. In either case the\r\nsense of the author may not be truly given. It is not always easy to\r\npreserve a proper mean between these extremes. The translators of\r\nJomini's Summary of the Principles of the Art of War have endeavored to\r\nrender their author into plain English, without mutilating or adding to\r\nhis ideas, attempting no display and making no criticisms.\r\n\r\nTo persons accustomed to read for instruction in military matters, it is\r\nnot necessary to say a word with reference to the merits of Jomini. To\r\nthose not thus accustomed heretofore, but who are becoming more\r\ninterested in such subjects, (and this class must include the great mass\r\nof the American public,) it is sufficient to say, and it may be said\r\nwith entire truth, that General Jomini is admitted by all competent\r\njudges to be one of the ablest military critics and historians of this\r\nor any other day.\r\n\r\nThe translation now presented to the people has been made with the\r\nearnest hope and the sincere expectation of its proving useful. As the\r\nexistence of a large, well-instructed standing army is deemed\r\nincompatible with our institutions, it becomes the more important that\r\nmilitary information be as extensively diffused as possible among the\r\npeople. If by the present work the translators shall find they have\r\ncontributed, even in an inconsiderable degree, to this important object,\r\nthey will be amply repaid for the care and labor expended upon it.\r\n\r\nTo those persons to whom the study of the art of war is a new one, it is\r\nrecommended to begin at the article \"Strategy,\" Chapter III., from that\r\npoint to read to the end of the Second Appendix, and then to return to\r\nChapters I. and II. It should be borne in mind that this subject, to be\r\nappreciated, must be studied, map in hand: this remark is especially\r\ntrue of strategy. An acquaintance with the campaigns of Napoleon I. is\r\nquite important, as they are constantly referred to by Jomini and by all\r\nother recent writers on the military art.\r\n\r\nU.S. Military Academy,\r\nWest Point, N.Y.\r\nJanuary, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATORS' PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS OF THE BRANCHES OF THE ART OF WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.

A sixth and essential branch, hitherto\r\nunrecognized, might be termed _Diplomacy in its relation to War_.\r\nAlthough this branch is more naturally and intimately connected with the\r\nprofession of a statesman than with that of a soldier, it cannot be\r\ndenied that, if it be useless to a subordinate general, it is\r\nindispensable to every general commanding an army: it enters into all\r\nthe combinations which may lead to a war, and has a connection with the\r\nvarious operations to be undertaken in this war; and, in this view, it\r\nshould have a place in a work like this.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, the art of war consists of six distinct parts:--\r\n\r\n1. Statesmanship in its relation to war.\r\n\r\n2. Strategy, or the art of properly directing masses upon the theater of\r\nwar, either for defense or for invasion.\r\n\r\n3. Grand Tactics.\r\n\r\n4. Logistics, or the art of moving armies.\r\n\r\n5. Engineering,--the attack and defense of fortifications.\r\n\r\n6. Minor Tactics.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to analyze the principal combinations of the first four\r\nbranches, omitting the consideration of tactics and of the art of\r\nengineering.\r\n\r\nFamiliarity with all these parts is not essential in order to be a good\r\ninfantry, cavalry, or artillery officer; but for a general, or for a\r\nstaff officer, this knowledge is indispensable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nSTATESMANSHIP IN ITS RELATION TO WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder this head are included those considerations from which a statesman\r\nconcludes whether a war is proper, opportune, or indispensable, and\r\ndetermines the various operations necessary to attain the object of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nA government goes to war,--\r\n\r\nTo reclaim certain rights or to defend them;\r\n\r\nTo protect and maintain the great interests of the state, as commerce,\r\nmanufactures, or agriculture;\r\n\r\nTo uphold neighboring states whose existence is necessary either for the\r\nsafety of the government or the balance of power;\r\n\r\nTo fulfill the obligations of offensive and defensive alliances;\r\n\r\nTo propagate political or religious theories, to crush them out, or to\r\ndefend them;\r\n\r\nTo increase the influence and power of the state by acquisitions of\r\nterritory;\r\n\r\nTo defend the threatened independence of the state;\r\n\r\nTo avenge insulted honor; or,\r\n\r\nFrom a mania for conquest.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that these different kinds of war influence in some\r\ndegree the nature and extent of the efforts and operations necessary for\r\nthe proposed end. The party who has provoked the war may be reduced to\r\nthe defensive, and the party assailed may assume the offensive; and\r\nthere may be other circumstances which will affect the nature and\r\nconduct of a war, as,--\r\n\r\n1. A state may simply make war against another state.\r\n\r\n2. A state may make war against several states in alliance with each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n3. A state in alliance with another may make war upon a single enemy.\r\n\r\n4. A state may be either the principal party or an auxiliary.\r\n\r\n5. In the latter case a state may join in the struggle at its beginning\r\nor after it has commenced.\r\n\r\n6. The theater of war may be upon the soil of the enemy, upon that of an\r\nally, or upon its own.\r\n\r\n7. If the war be one of invasion, it may be upon adjacent or distant\r\nterritory: it may be prudent and cautious, or it may be bold and\r\nadventurous.\r\n\r\n8. It may be a national war, either against ourselves or against the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n9. The war may be a civil or a religious war.\r\n\r\nWar is always to be conducted according to the great principles of the\r\nart; but great discretion must be exercised in the nature of the\r\noperations to be undertaken, which should depend upon the circumstances\r\nof the case.\r\n\r\nFor example: two hundred thousand French wishing to subjugate the\r\nSpanish people, united to a man against them, would not maneuver as the\r\nsame number of French in a march upon Vienna, or any other capital, to\r\ncompel a peace; nor would a French army fight the guerrillas of Mina as\r\nthey fought the Russians at Borodino; nor would a French army venture to\r\nmarch upon Vienna without considering what might be the tone and temper\r\nof the governments and communities between the Rhine and the Inn, or\r\nbetween the Danube and the Elbe. A regiment should always fight in\r\nnearly the same way; but commanding generals must be guided by\r\ncircumstances and events.\r\n\r\nTo these different combinations, which belong more or less to\r\nstatesmanship, may be added others which relate solely to the management\r\nof armies. The name Military Policy is given to them; for they belong\r\nexclusively neither to diplomacy nor to strategy, but are still of the\r\nhighest importance in the plans both of a statesman and a general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE I.\r\n\r\nOffensive Wars to Reclaim Rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a state has claims upon another, it may not always be best to\r\nenforce them by arms. The public interest must be consulted before\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe most just war is one which is founded upon undoubted rights, and\r\nwhich, in addition, promises to the state advantages commensurate with\r\nthe sacrifices required and the hazards incurred. Unfortunately, in our\r\ntimes there are so many doubtful and contested rights that most wars,\r\nthough apparently based upon bequests, or wills, or marriages, are in\r\nreality but wars of expediency. The question of the succession to the\r\nSpanish crown under Louis XIV. was very clear, since it was plainly\r\nsettled by a solemn will, and was supported by family ties and by the\r\ngeneral consent of the Spanish nation; yet it was stoutly contested by\r\nall Europe, and produced a general coalition against the legitimate\r\nlegatee.\r\n\r\nFrederick II., while Austria and France were at war, brought forward an\r\nold claim, entered Silesia in force and seized this province, thus\r\ndoubling the power of Prussia. This was a stroke of genius; and, even if\r\nhe had failed, he could not have been much censured; for the grandeur\r\nand importance of the enterprise justified him in his attempt, as far as\r\nsuch attempts can be justified.\r\n\r\nIn wars of this nature no rules can be laid down. To watch and to profit\r\nby every circumstance covers all that can be said. Offensive movements\r\nshould be suitable to the end to be attained. The most natural step\r\nwould be to occupy the disputed territory: then offensive operations may\r\nbe carried on according to circumstances and to the respective strength\r\nof the parties, the object being to secure the cession of the territory\r\nby the enemy, and the means being to threaten him in the heart of his\r\nown country. Every thing depends upon the alliances the parties may be\r\nable to secure with other states, and upon their military resources. In\r\nan offensive movement, scrupulous care must be exercised not to arouse\r\nthe jealousy of any other state which might come to the aid of the\r\nenemy. It is a part of the duty of a statesman to foresee this chance,\r\nand to obviate it by making proper explanations and giving proper\r\nguarantees to other states.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE II.\r\n\r\nOf Wars Defensive Politically, and Offensive in a Military Point of\r\nView.\r\n\r\n\r\nA state attacked by another which renews an old claim rarely yields it\r\nwithout a war: it prefers to defend its territory, as is always more\r\nhonorable. But it may be advantageous to take the offensive, instead of\r\nawaiting the attack on the frontiers.\r\n\r\nThere are often advantages in a war of invasion: there are also\r\nadvantages in awaiting the enemy upon one's own soil. A power with no\r\ninternal dissensions, and under no apprehension of an attack by a third\r\nparty, will always find it advantageous to carry the war upon hostile\r\nsoil. This course will spare its territory from devastation, carry on\r\nthe war at the expense of the enemy, excite the ardor of its soldiers,\r\nand depress the spirits of the adversary. Nevertheless, in a purely\r\nmilitary sense, it is certain that an army operating in its own\r\nterritory, upon a theater of which all the natural and artificial\r\nfeatures are well known, where all movements are aided by a knowledge of\r\nthe country, by the favor of the citizens, and the aid of the\r\nconstituted authorities, possesses great advantages.\r\n\r\nThese plain truths have their application in all descriptions of war;\r\nbut, if the principles of strategy are always the same, it is different\r\nwith the political part of war, which is modified by the tone of\r\ncommunities, by localities, and by the characters of men at the head of\r\nstates and armies. The fact of these modifications has been used to\r\nprove that war knows no rules. Military science rests upon principles\r\nwhich can never be safely violated in the presence of an active and\r\nskillful enemy, while the moral and political part of war presents these\r\nvariations. Plans of operations are made as circumstances may demand: to\r\nexecute these plans, the great principles of war must be observed.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the plan of a war against France, Austria, or Russia would\r\ndiffer widely from one against the brave but undisciplined bands of\r\nTurks, which cannot be kept in order, are not able to maneuver well, and\r\npossess no steadiness under misfortunes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE III.\r\n\r\nWars of Expediency.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe invasion of Silesia by Frederick II., and the war of the Spanish\r\nSuccession, were wars of expediency.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of wars of expediency: first, where a powerful state\r\nundertakes to acquire natural boundaries for commercial and political\r\nreasons; secondly, to lessen the power of a dangerous rival or to\r\nprevent his aggrandizement. These last are wars of intervention; for a\r\nstate will rarely singly attack a dangerous rival: it will endeavor to\r\nform a coalition for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThese views belong rather to statesmanship or diplomacy than to war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE IV.\r\n\r\nOf Wars with or without Allies.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, in a war an ally is to be desired, all other things being\r\nequal. Although a great state will more probably succeed than two weaker\r\nstates in alliance against it, still the alliance is stronger than\r\neither separately. The ally not only furnishes a contingent of troops,\r\nbut, in addition, annoys the enemy to a great degree by threatening\r\nportions of his frontier which otherwise would have been secure. All\r\nhistory teaches that no enemy is so insignificant as to be despised and\r\nneglected by any power, however formidable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE V.\r\n\r\nWars of Intervention.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo interfere in a contest already begun promises more advantages to a\r\nstate than war under any other circumstances; and the reason is plain.\r\nThe power which interferes throws upon one side of the scale its whole\r\nweight and influence; it interferes at the most opportune moment, when\r\nit can make decisive use of its resources.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of intervention: 1. Intervention in the internal\r\naffairs of neighboring states; 2. Intervention in external relations.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said as to the moral character of interventions of the\r\nfirst class, instances are frequent. The Romans acquired power by these\r\ninterferences, and the empire of the English India Company was assured\r\nin a similar manner. These interventions are not always successful.\r\nWhile Russia has added to her power by interference with Poland,\r\nAustria, on the contrary, was almost ruined by her attempt to interfere\r\nin the internal affairs of France during the Revolution.\r\n\r\nIntervention in the external relations of states is more legitimate, and\r\nperhaps more advantageous. It may be doubtful whether a nation has the\r\nright to interfere in the internal affairs of another people; but it\r\ncertainly has a right to oppose it when it propagates disorder which may\r\nreach the adjoining states.\r\n\r\nThere are three reasons for intervention in exterior foreign\r\nwars,--viz.: 1, by virtue of a treaty which binds to aid; 2, to maintain\r\nthe political equilibrium; 3, to avoid certain evil consequences of the\r\nwar already commenced, or to secure certain advantages from the war not\r\nto be obtained otherwise.\r\n\r\nHistory is filled with examples of powers which have fallen by neglect\r\nof these principles. \"A state begins to decline when it permits the\r\nimmoderate aggrandizement of a rival, and a secondary power may become\r\nthe arbiter of nations if it throw its weight into the balance at the\r\nproper time.\"\r\n\r\nIn a military view, it seems plain that the sudden appearance of a new\r\nand large army as a third party in a well-contested war must be\r\ndecisive. Much will depend upon its geographical position in reference\r\nto the armies already in the field. For example, in the winter of 1807\r\nNapoleon crossed the Vistula and ventured to the walls of Königsberg,\r\nleaving Austria on his rear and having Russia in front. If Austria had\r\nlaunched an army of one hundred thousand men from Bohemia upon the Oder,\r\nit is probable that the power of Napoleon would have been ended; there\r\nis every reason to think that his army could not have regained the\r\nRhine. Austria preferred to wait till she could raise four hundred\r\nthousand men. Two years afterward, with this force she took the field,\r\nand was beaten; while one hundred thousand men well employed at the\r\nproper time would have decided the fate of Europe.\r\n\r\nThere are several kinds of war resulting from these two different\r\ninterventions:--\r\n\r\n1. Where the intervention is merely auxiliary, and with a force\r\nspecified by former treaties.\r\n\r\n2. Where the intervention is to uphold a feeble neighbor by defending\r\nhis territory, thus shifting the scene of war to other soil.\r\n\r\n3. A state interferes as a principal party when near the theater of\r\nwar,--which supposes the case of a coalition of several powers against\r\none.\r\n\r\n4. A state interferes either in a struggle already in progress, or\r\ninterferes before the declaration of war.\r\n\r\nWhen a state intervenes with only a small contingent, in obedience to\r\ntreaty-stipulations, it is simply an accessory, and has but little voice\r\nin the main operations; but when it intervenes as a principal party, and\r\nwith an imposing force, the case is quite different.\r\n\r\nThe military chances in these wars are varied. The Russian army in the\r\nSeven Years' War was in fact auxiliary to that of Austria and France:\r\nstill, it was a principal party in the North until its occupation of\r\nPrussia. But when Generals Fermor and Soltikoff conducted the army as\r\nfar as Brandenburg it acted solely in the interest of Austria: the fate\r\nof these troops, far from their base, depended upon the good or bad\r\nmaneuvering of their allies.\r\n\r\nSuch distant excursions are dangerous, and generally delicate\r\noperations. The campaigns of 1799 and 1805 furnish sad illustrations of\r\nthis, to which we shall again refer in Article XXIX., in discussing the\r\nmilitary character of these expeditions.\r\n\r\nIt follows, then, that the safety of the army may be endangered by these\r\ndistant interventions. The counterbalancing advantage is that its own\r\nterritory cannot then be easily invaded, since the scene of hostilities\r\nis so distant; so that what may be a misfortune for the general may be,\r\nin a measure, an advantage to the state.\r\n\r\nIn wars of this character the essentials are to secure a general who is\r\nboth a statesman and a soldier; to have clear stipulations with the\r\nallies as to the part to be taken by each in the principal operations;\r\nfinally, to agree upon an objective point which shall be in harmony with\r\nthe common interests. By the neglect of these precautions, the greater\r\nnumber of coalitions have failed, or have maintained a difficult\r\nstruggle with a power more united but weaker than the allies.\r\n\r\nThe third kind of intervention, which consists in interfering with the\r\nwhole force of the state and near to its frontiers, is more promising\r\nthan the others. Austria had an opportunity of this character in 1807,\r\nbut failed to profit by it: she again had the opportunity in 1813.\r\nNapoleon had just collected his forces in Saxony, when Austria, taking\r\nhis front of operations in reverse, threw herself into the struggle with\r\ntwo hundred thousand men, with almost perfect certainty of success. She\r\nregained in two months the Italian empire and her influence in Germany,\r\nwhich had been lost by fifteen years of disaster. In this intervention\r\nAustria had not only the political but also the military chances in her\r\nfavor,--a double result, combining the highest advantages.\r\n\r\nHer success was rendered more certain by the fact that while the theater\r\nwas sufficiently near her frontiers to permit the greatest possible\r\ndisplay of force, she at the same time interfered in a contest already\r\nin progress, upon which she entered with the whole of her resources and\r\nat the time most opportune for her.\r\n\r\nThis double advantage is so decisive that it permits not only powerful\r\nmonarchies, but even small states, to exercise a controlling influence\r\nwhen they know how to profit by it.\r\n\r\nTwo examples may establish this. In 1552, the Elector Maurice of Saxony\r\nboldly declared war against Charles V., who was master of Spain, Italy,\r\nand the German empire, and had been victorious over Francis I. and held\r\nFrance in his grasp. This movement carried the war into the Tyrol, and\r\narrested the great conqueror in his career.\r\n\r\nIn 1706, the Duke of Savoy, Victor Amadeus, by declaring himself hostile\r\nto Louis XIV., changed the state of affairs in Italy, and caused the\r\nrecall of the French army from the banks of the Adige to the walls of\r\nTurin, where it encountered the great catastrophe which immortalized\r\nPrince Eugene.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to illustrate the importance and effect of these\r\nopportune interventions: more illustrations might be given, but they\r\ncould not add to the conviction of the reader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE VI.\r\n\r\nAggressive Wars for Conquest and other Reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two very different kinds of invasion: one attacks an adjoining\r\nstate; the other attacks a distant point, over intervening territory of\r\ngreat extent whose inhabitants may be neutral, doubtful, or hostile.\r\n\r\nWars of conquest, unhappily, are often prosperous,--as Alexander, Cæsar,\r\nand Napoleon during a portion of his career, have fully proved. However,\r\nthere are natural limits in these wars, which cannot be passed without\r\nincurring great disaster. Cambyses in Nubia, Darius in Scythia, Crassus\r\nand the Emperor Julian among the Parthians, and Napoleon in Russia,\r\nfurnish bloody proofs of these truths.--The love of conquest, however,\r\nwas not the only motive with Napoleon: his personal position, and his\r\ncontest with England, urged him to enterprises the aim of which was to\r\nmake him supreme. It is true that he loved war and its chances; but he\r\nwas also a victim to the necessity of succeeding in his efforts or of\r\nyielding to England. It might be said that he was sent into this world\r\nto teach generals and statesmen what they should avoid. His victories\r\nteach what may be accomplished by activity, boldness, and skill; his\r\ndisasters, what might have been avoided by prudence.\r\n\r\nA war of invasion without good reason--like that of Genghis Khan--is a\r\ncrime against humanity; but it may be excused, if not approved, when\r\ninduced by great interests or when conducted with good motives.\r\n\r\nThe invasions of Spain of 1808 and of 1823 differed equally in object\r\nand in results: the first was a cunning and wanton attack, which\r\nthreatened the existence of the Spanish nation, and was fatal to its\r\nauthor; the second, while combating dangerous principles, fostered the\r\ngeneral interests of the country, and was the more readily brought to a\r\nsuccessful termination because its object met with the approval of the\r\nmajority of the people whose territory was invaded.\r\n\r\nThese illustrations show that invasions are not necessarily all of the\r\nsame character. The first contributed largely to the fall of Napoleon;\r\nthe second restored the relation between France and Spain, which ought\r\nnever to have been changed.\r\n\r\nLet us hope that invasions may be rare. Still, it is better to attack\r\nthan to be invaded; and let us remember that the surest way to check the\r\nspirit of conquest and usurpation is to oppose it by intervention at the\r\nproper time.\r\n\r\nAn invasion, to be successful, must, be proportioned in magnitude to the\r\nend to be attained and to the obstacles to be overcome.\r\n\r\nAn invasion against an exasperated people, ready for all sacrifices and\r\nlikely to be aided by a powerful neighbor, is a dangerous enterprise, as\r\nwas well proved by the war in Spain, (1808,) and by the wars of the\r\nRevolution in 1792, 1793, and 1794. In these latter wars, if France was\r\nbetter prepared than Spain, she had no powerful ally, and she was\r\nattacked by all Europe upon both land and sea.\r\n\r\nAlthough the circumstances were different, the Russian invasion of\r\nTurkey developed, in some respects, the same symptoms of national\r\nresistance. The religious hatred of the Ottoman powerfully incited him\r\nto arms; but the same motive was powerless among the Greeks, who were\r\ntwice as numerous as the Turks. Had the interests of the Greeks and\r\nTurks been harmonized, as were those of Alsace with France, the united\r\npeople would have been stronger, but they would have lacked the element\r\nof religious fanaticism. The war of 1828 proved that Turkey was\r\nformidable only upon the frontiers, where her bravest troops were found,\r\nwhile in the interior all was weakness.\r\n\r\nWhen an invasion of a neighboring territory has nothing to fear from the\r\ninhabitants, the principles of strategy shape its course. The popular\r\nfeeling rendered the invasions of Italy, Austria, and Prussia so prompt.\r\n(These military points are treated of in Article XXIX.) But when the\r\ninvasion is distant and extensive territories intervene, its success\r\nwill depend more upon diplomacy than upon strategy. The first step to\r\ninsure success will be to secure the sincere and devoted alliance of a\r\nstate adjoining the enemy, which will afford reinforcements of troops,\r\nand, what is still more important, give a secure base of operations,\r\ndepots of supplies, and a safe refuge in case of disaster. The ally must\r\nhave the same interest in success as the invaders, to render all this\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nDiplomacy, while almost decisive in distant expeditions, is not\r\npowerless in adjacent invasions; for here a hostile intervention may\r\narrest the most brilliant successes. The invasions of Austria in 1805\r\nand 1809 might have ended differently if Prussia had interfered. The\r\ninvasion of the North of Germany in 1807 was, so to speak, permitted by\r\nAustria. That of Rumelia in 1829 might have ended in disaster, had not a\r\nwise statesmanship by negotiation obviated all chance of intervention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE VII.\r\n\r\nWars of Opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough wars of opinion, national wars, and civil wars are sometimes\r\nconfounded, they differ enough to require separate notice.\r\n\r\nWars of opinion may be intestine, both intestine and foreign, and,\r\nlastly, (which, however, is rare,) they may be foreign or exterior\r\nwithout being intestine or civil.\r\n\r\nWars of opinion between two states belong also to the class of wars of\r\nintervention; for they result either from doctrines which one party\r\ndesires to propagate among its neighbors, or from dogmas which it\r\ndesires to crush,--in both cases leading to intervention. Although\r\noriginating in religious or political dogmas, these wars are most\r\ndeplorable; for, like national wars, they enlist the worst passions, and\r\nbecome vindictive, cruel, and terrible.\r\n\r\nThe wars of Islamism, the Crusades, the Thirty Years' War, the wars of\r\nthe League, present nearly the same characteristics. Often religion is\r\nthe pretext to obtain political power, and the war is not really one of\r\ndogmas. The successors of Mohammed cared more to extend their empire\r\nthan to preach the Koran, and Philip II., bigot as he was, did not\r\nsustain the League in France for the purpose of advancing the Roman\r\nChurch. We agree with M. Ancelot that Louis IX., when he went on a\r\ncrusade in Egypt, thought more of the commerce of the Indies than of\r\ngaining possession of the Holy Sepulcher.\r\n\r\nThe dogma sometimes is not only a pretext, but is a powerful ally; for\r\nit excites the ardor of the people, and also creates a party. For\r\ninstance, the Swedes in the Thirty Years' War, and Philip II. in France,\r\nhad allies in the country more powerful than their armies. It may,\r\nhowever, happen, as in the Crusades and the wars of Islamism, that the\r\ndogma for which the war is waged, instead of friends, finds only bitter\r\nenemies in the country invaded; and then the contest becomes fearful.\r\n\r\nThe chances of support and resistance in wars of political opinions are\r\nabout equal. It may be recollected how in 1792 associations of fanatics\r\nthought it possible to propagate throughout Europe the famous\r\ndeclaration of the rights of man, and how governments became justly\r\nalarmed, and rushed to arms probably with the intention of only forcing\r\nthe lava of this volcano back into its crater and there extinguishing\r\nit. The means were not fortunate; for war and aggression are\r\ninappropriate measures for arresting an evil which lies wholly in the\r\nhuman passions, excited in a temporary paroxysm, of less duration as it\r\nis the more violent. Time is the true remedy for all bad passions and\r\nfor all anarchical doctrines. A civilized nation may bear the yoke of a\r\nfactious and unrestrained multitude for a short interval; but these\r\nstorms soon pass away, and reason resumes her sway. To attempt to\r\nrestrain such a mob by a foreign force is to attempt to restrain the\r\nexplosion of a mine when the powder has already been ignited: it is far\r\nbetter to await the explosion and afterward fill up the crater than to\r\ntry to prevent it and to perish in the attempt.\r\n\r\nAfter a profound study of the Revolution, I am convinced that, if the\r\nGirondists and National Assembly had not been threatened by foreign\r\narmaments, they would never have dared to lay their sacrilegious hands\r\nupon the feeble but venerable head of Louis XVI. The Girondists would\r\nnever have been crushed by the Mountain but for the reverses of\r\nDumouriez and the threats of invasion. And if they had been permitted to\r\nclash and quarrel with each other to their hearts' content, it is\r\nprobable that, instead of giving place to the terrible Convention, the\r\nAssembly would slowly have returned to the restoration of good,\r\ntemperate, monarchical doctrines, in accordance with the necessities and\r\nthe immemorial traditions of the French.\r\n\r\nIn a military view these wars are fearful, since the invading force not\r\nonly is met by the armies of the enemy, but is exposed to the attacks of\r\nan exasperated people. It may be said that the violence of one party\r\nwill necessarily create support for the invaders by the formation of\r\nanother and opposite one; but, if the exasperated party possesses all\r\nthe public resources, the armies, the forts, the arsenals, and if it is\r\nsupported by a large majority of the people, of what avail will be the\r\nsupport of the faction which possesses no such means? What service did\r\none hundred thousand Vendeans and one hundred thousand Federalists do\r\nfor the Coalition in 1793?\r\n\r\nHistory contains but a single example of a struggle like that of the\r\nRevolution; and it appears to clearly demonstrate the danger of\r\nattacking an intensely-excited nation. However the bad management of the\r\nmilitary operations was one cause of the unexpected result, and before\r\ndeducing any certain maxims from this war, we should ascertain what\r\nwould have been the result if after the flight of Dumouriez, instead of\r\ndestroying and capturing fortresses, the allies had informed the\r\ncommanders of those fortresses that they contemplated no wrong to\r\nFrance, to her forts or her brave armies, and had marched on Paris with\r\ntwo hundred thousand men. They might have restored the monarchy; and,\r\nagain, they might never have returned, at least without the protection\r\nof an equal force on their retreat to the Rhine. It is difficult to\r\ndecide this, since the experiment was never made, and as all would have\r\ndepended upon the course of the French nation and the army. The problem\r\nthus presents two equally grave solutions. The campaign of 1793 gave\r\none; whether the other might have been obtained, it is difficult to say.\r\nExperiment alone could have determined it.\r\n\r\nThe military precepts for such wars are nearly the same as for national\r\nwars, differing, however, in a vital point. In national wars the country\r\nshould be occupied and subjugated, the fortified places besieged and\r\nreduced, and the armies destroyed; whereas in wars of opinion it is of\r\nless importance to subjugate the country; here great efforts should be\r\nmade to gain the end speedily, without delaying for details, care being\r\nconstantly taken to avoid any acts which might alarm the nation for its\r\nindependence or the integrity of its territory.\r\n\r\nThe war in Spain in 1823 is an example which may be cited in favor of\r\nthis course in opposition to that of the Revolution. It is true that the\r\nconditions were slightly different; for the French army of 1792 was\r\nmade up of more solid elements than that of the Radicals of the Isla de\r\nLeon. The war of the Revolution was at once a war of opinion, a national\r\nwar, and a civil war,--while, if the first war in Spain in 1808 was\r\nthoroughly a national war, that of 1823 was a partial struggle of\r\nopinions without the element of nationality; and hence the enormous\r\ndifference in the results.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the expedition of the Duke of Angoulême was well carried out.\r\nInstead of attacking fortresses, he acted in conformity to the\r\nabove-mentioned precepts. Pushing on rapidly to the Ebro, he there\r\ndivided his forces, to seize, at their sources, all the elements of\r\nstrength of their enemies,--which they could safely do, since they were\r\nsustained by a majority of the inhabitants. If he had followed the\r\ninstructions of the Ministry, to proceed methodically to the conquest of\r\nthe country and the reduction of the fortresses between the Pyrenees and\r\nthe Ebro, in order to provide a base of operations, he would perhaps\r\nhave failed in his mission, or at least made the war a long and bloody\r\none, by exciting the national spirit by an occupation of the country\r\nsimilar to that of 1807.\r\n\r\nEmboldened by the hearty welcome of the people, he comprehended that it\r\nwas a political operation rather than a military one, and that it\r\nbehooved him to consummate it rapidly. His conduct, so different from\r\nthat of the allies in 1793, deserves careful attention from all charged\r\nwith similar missions. In three months the army was under the walls of\r\nCadiz.\r\n\r\nIf the events now transpiring in the Peninsula prove that statesmanship\r\nwas not able to profit by success in order to found a suitable and solid\r\norder of things, the fault was neither in the army nor in its\r\ncommanders, but in the Spanish government, which, yielding to the\r\ncounsel of violent reactionaries, was unable to rise to the height of\r\nits mission. The arbiter between two great hostile interests, Ferdinand\r\nblindly threw himself into the arms of the party which professed a deep\r\nveneration for the throne, but which intended to use the royal authority\r\nfor the furtherance of its own ends, regardless of consequences. The\r\nnation remained divided in two hostile camps, which it would not have\r\nbeen impossible to calm and reconcile in time. These camps came anew\r\ninto collision, as I predicted in Verona in 1823,--a striking lesson, by\r\nwhich no one is disposed to profit in that beautiful and unhappy land,\r\nalthough history is not wanting in examples to prove that violent\r\nreactions, any more than revolutions, are not elements with which to\r\nconstruct and consolidate. May God grant that from this frightful\r\nconflict may emerge a strong and respected monarchy, equally separated\r\nfrom all factions, and based upon a disciplined army as well as upon the\r\ngeneral interests of the country,--a monarchy capable of rallying to its\r\nsupport this incomprehensible Spanish nation, which, with merits not\r\nless extraordinary than its faults, was always a problem for those who\r\nwere in the best position to know it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE VIII.\r\n\r\nNational Wars.\r\n\r\n\r\nNational wars, to which we have referred in speaking of those of\r\ninvasion, are the most formidable of all. This name can only be applied\r\nto such as are waged against a united people, or a great majority of\r\nthem, filled with a noble ardor and determined to sustain their\r\nindependence: then every step is disputed, the army holds only its\r\ncamp-ground, its supplies can only be obtained at the point of the\r\nsword, and its convoys are everywhere threatened or captured.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of a spontaneous uprising of a nation is rarely seen; and,\r\nthough there be in it something grand and noble which commands our\r\nadmiration, the consequences are so terrible that, for the sake of\r\nhumanity, we ought to hope never to see it. This uprising must not be\r\nconfounded with a national defense in accordance with the institutions\r\nof the state and directed by the government.\r\n\r\nThis uprising may be produced by the most opposite causes. The serfs may\r\nrise in a body at the call of the government, and their masters,\r\naffected by a noble love of their sovereign and country, may set them\r\nthe example and take the command of them; and, similarly, a fanatical\r\npeople may arm under the appeal of its priests; or a people enthusiastic\r\nin its political opinions, or animated by a sacred love of its\r\ninstitutions, may rush to meet the enemy in defense of all it holds most\r\ndear.\r\n\r\nThe control of the sea is of much importance in the results of a\r\nnational invasion. If the people possess a long stretch of coast, and\r\nare masters of the sea or in alliance with a power which controls it,\r\ntheir power of resistance is quintupled, not only on account of the\r\nfacility of feeding the insurrection and of alarming the enemy on all\r\nthe points he may occupy, but still more by the difficulties which will\r\nbe thrown in the way of his procuring supplies by the sea.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the country may be such as to contribute to the facility\r\nof a national defense. In mountainous countries the people are always\r\nmost formidable; next to these are countries covered with extensive\r\nforests.\r\n\r\nThe resistance of the Swiss to Austria and to the Duke of Burgundy, that\r\nof the Catalans in 1712 and in 1809, the difficulties encountered by the\r\nRussians in the subjugation of the tribes of the Caucasus, and, finally,\r\nthe reiterated efforts of the Tyrolese, clearly demonstrate that the\r\ninhabitants of mountainous regions have always resisted for a longer\r\ntime than those of the plains,--which is due as much to the difference\r\nin character and customs as to the difference in the natural features of\r\nthe countries.\r\n\r\nDefiles and large forests, as well as rocky regions, favor this kind of\r\ndefense; and the Bocage of La Vendée, so justly celebrated, proves that\r\nany country, even if it be only traversed by large hedges and ditches or\r\ncanals, admits of a formidable defense.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties in the path of an army in wars of opinions, as well as\r\nin national wars, are very great, and render the mission of the general\r\nconducting them very difficult. The events just mentioned, the contest\r\nof the Netherlands with Philip II. and that of the Americans with the\r\nEnglish, furnish evident proofs of this; but the much more extraordinary\r\nstruggle of La Vendée with the victorious Republic, those of Spain,\r\nPortugal, and the Tyrol against Napoleon, and, finally, those of the\r\nMorea against the Turks, and of Navarre against the armies of Queen\r\nChristina, are still more striking illustrations.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties are particularly great when the people are supported by\r\na considerable nucleus of disciplined troops. The invader has only an\r\narmy: his adversaries have an army, and a people wholly or almost wholly\r\nin arms, and making means of resistance out of every thing, each\r\nindividual of whom conspires against the common enemy; even the\r\nnon-combatants have an interest in his ruin and accelerate it by every\r\nmeans in their power. He holds scarcely any ground but that upon which\r\nhe encamps; outside the limits of his camp every thing is hostile and\r\nmultiplies a thousandfold the difficulties he meets at every step.\r\n\r\nThese obstacles become almost insurmountable when the country is\r\ndifficult. Each armed inhabitant knows the smallest paths and their\r\nconnections; he finds everywhere a relative or friend who aids him; the\r\ncommanders also know the country, and, learning immediately the\r\nslightest movement on the part of the invader, can adopt the best\r\nmeasures to defeat his projects; while the latter, without information\r\nof their movements, and not in a condition to send out detachments to\r\ngain it, having no resource but in his bayonets, and certain safety only\r\nin the concentration of his columns, is like a blind man: his\r\ncombinations are failures; and when, after the most carefully-concerted\r\nmovements and the most rapid and fatiguing marches, he thinks he is\r\nabout to accomplish his aim and deal a terrible blow, he finds no signs\r\nof the enemy but his camp-fires: so that while, like Don Quixote, he is\r\nattacking windmills, his adversary is on his line of communications,\r\ndestroys the detachments left to guard it, surprises his convoys, his\r\ndepots, and carries on a war so disastrous for the invader that he must\r\ninevitably yield after a time.\r\n\r\nIn Spain I was a witness of two terrible examples of this kind. When\r\nNey's corps replaced Soult's at Corunna, I had camped the companies of\r\nthe artillery-train between Betanzos and Corunna, in the midst of four\r\nbrigades distant from the camp from two to three leagues, and no Spanish\r\nforces had been seen within fifty miles; Soult still occupied Santiago\r\nde Compostela, the division Maurice-Mathieu was at Ferrol and Lugo,\r\nMarchand's at Corunna and Betanzos: nevertheless, one fine night the\r\ncompanies of the train--men and horses--disappeared, and we were never\r\nable to discover what became of them: a solitary wounded corporal\r\nescaped to report that the peasants, led by their monks and priests, had\r\nthus made away with them. Four months afterward, Ney with a single\r\ndivision marched to conquer the Asturias, descending the valley of the\r\nNavia, while Kellermann debouched from Leon by the Oviedo road. A part\r\nof the corps of La Romana which was guarding the Asturias marched behind\r\nthe very heights which inclose the valley of the Navia, at most but a\r\nleague from our columns, without the marshal knowing a word of it: when\r\nhe was entering Gijon, the army of La Romana attacked the center of the\r\nregiments of the division Marchand, which, being scattered to guard\r\nGalicia, barely escaped, and that only by the prompt return of the\r\nmarshal to Lugo. This war presented a thousand incidents as striking as\r\nthis. All the gold of Mexico could not have procured reliable\r\ninformation for the French; what was given was but a lure to make them\r\nfall more readily into snares.\r\n\r\nNo army, however disciplined, can contend successfully against such a\r\nsystem applied to a great nation, unless it be strong enough to hold all\r\nthe essential points of the country, cover its communications, and at\r\nthe same time furnish an active force sufficient to beat the enemy\r\nwherever he may present himself. If this enemy has a regular army of\r\nrespectable size to be a nucleus around which to rally the people, what\r\nforce will be sufficient to be superior everywhere, and to assure the\r\nsafety of the long lines of communication against numerous bodies?\r\n\r\nThe Peninsular War should be carefully studied, to learn all the\r\nobstacles which a general and his brave troops may encounter in the\r\noccupation or conquest of a country whose people are all in arms. What\r\nefforts of patience, courage, and resignation did it not cost the troops\r\nof Napoleon, Massena, Soult, Ney, and Suchet to sustain themselves for\r\nsix years against three or four hundred thousand armed Spaniards and\r\nPortuguese supported by the regular armies of Wellington, Beresford,\r\nBlake, La Romana, Cuesta, Castaños, Reding, and Ballasteros!\r\n\r\nIf success be possible in such a war, the following general course will\r\nbe most likely to insure it,--viz.: make a display of a mass of troops\r\nproportioned to the obstacles and resistance likely to be encountered,\r\ncalm the popular passions in every possible way, exhaust them by time\r\nand patience, display courtesy, gentleness, and severity united, and,\r\nparticularly, deal justly. The examples of Henry IV. in the wars of the\r\nLeague, of Marshal Berwick in Catalonia, of Suchet in Aragon and\r\nValencia, of Hoche in La Vendée, are models of their kind, which may be\r\nemployed according to circumstances with equal success. The admirable\r\norder and discipline of the armies of Diebitsch and Paskevitch in the\r\nlate war were also models, and were not a little conducive to the\r\nsuccess of their enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe immense obstacles encountered by an invading force in these wars\r\nhave led some speculative persons to hope that there should never be any\r\nother kind, since then wars would become more rare, and, conquest being\r\nalso more difficult, would be less a temptation to ambitious leaders.\r\nThis reasoning is rather plausible than solid; for, to admit all its\r\nconsequences, it would be necessary always to be able to induce the\r\npeople to take up arms, and it would also be necessary for us to be\r\nconvinced that there would be in the future no wars but those of\r\nconquest, and that all legitimate though secondary wars, which are only\r\nto maintain the political equilibrium or defend the public interests,\r\nshould never occur again: otherwise, how could it be known when and how\r\nto excite the people to a national war? For example, if one hundred\r\nthousand Germans crossed the Rhine and entered France, originally with\r\nthe intention of preventing the conquest of Belgium by France, and\r\nwithout any other ambitious project, would it be a case where the whole\r\npopulation--men, women, and children--of Alsace, Lorraine, Champagne,\r\nand Burgundy, should rush to arms? to make a Saragossa of every walled\r\ntown, to bring about, by way of reprisals, murder, pillage, and\r\nincendiarism throughout the country? If all this be not done, and the\r\nGermans, in consequence of some success, should occupy these provinces,\r\nwho can say that they might not afterward seek to appropriate a part of\r\nthem, even though at first they had never contemplated it? The\r\ndifficulty of answering these two questions would seem to argue in favor\r\nof national wars. But is there no means of repelling such an invasion\r\nwithout bringing about an uprising of the whole population and a war of\r\nextermination? Is there no mean between these contests between the\r\npeople and the old regular method of war between permanent armies? Will\r\nit not be sufficient, for the efficient defense of the country, to\r\norganize a militia, or landwehr, which, uniformed and called by their\r\ngovernments into service, would regulate the part the people should take\r\nin the war, and place just limits to its barbarities?\r\n\r\nI answer in the affirmative; and, applying this mixed system to the\r\ncases stated above, I will guarantee that fifty thousand regular French\r\ntroops, supported by the National Guards of the East, would get the\r\nbetter of this German army which had crossed the Vosges; for, reduced to\r\nfifty thousand men by many detachments, upon nearing the Meuse or\r\narriving in Argonne it would have one hundred thousand men on its hands.\r\nTo attain this mean, we have laid it down as a necessity that good\r\nnational reserves be prepared for the army; which will be less expensive\r\nin peace and will insure the defense of the country in war. This system\r\nwas used by France in 1792, imitated by Austria in 1809, and by the\r\nwhole of Germany in 1813.\r\n\r\nI sum up this discussion by asserting that, without being a utopian\r\nphilanthropist, or a condottieri, a person may desire that wars of\r\nextermination may be banished from the code of nations, and that the\r\ndefenses of nations by disciplined militia, with the aid of good\r\npolitical alliances, may be sufficient to insure their independence.\r\n\r\nAs a soldier, preferring loyal and chivalrous warfare to organized\r\nassassination, if it be necessary to make a choice, I acknowledge that\r\nmy prejudices are in favor of the good old times when the French and\r\nEnglish Guards courteously invited each other to fire first,--as at\r\nFontenoy,--preferring them to the frightful epoch when priests, women,\r\nand children throughout Spain plotted the murder of isolated soldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE IX.\r\n\r\nCivil Wars, and Wars of Religion.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntestine wars, when not connected with a foreign quarrel, are generally\r\nthe result of a conflict of opinions, of political or religious\r\nsectarianism. In the Middle Ages they were more frequently the\r\ncollisions of feudal parties. Religious wars are above all the most\r\ndeplorable.\r\n\r\nWe can understand how a government may find it necessary to use force\r\nagainst its own subjects in order to crush out factions which would\r\nweaken the authority of the throne and the national strength; but that\r\nit should murder its citizens to compel them to say their prayers in\r\nFrench or Latin, or to recognize the supremacy of a foreign pontiff, is\r\ndifficult of conception. Never was a king more to be pitied than Louis\r\nXIV., who persecuted a million of industrious Protestants, who had put\r\nupon the throne his own Protestant ancestor. Wars of fanaticism are\r\nhorrible when mingled with exterior wars, and they are also frightful\r\nwhen they are family quarrels. The history of France in the times of the\r\nLeague should be an eternal lesson for nations and kings. It is\r\ndifficult to believe that a people so noble and chivalrous in the time\r\nof Francis I. should in twenty years have fallen into so deplorable a\r\nstate of brutality.\r\n\r\nTo give maxims in such wars would be absurd. There is one rule upon\r\nwhich all thoughtful men will be agreed: that is, to unite the two\r\nparties or sects to drive the foreigners from the soil, and afterward to\r\nreconcile by treaty the conflicting claims or rights. Indeed, the\r\nintervention of a third power in a religious dispute can only be with\r\nambitious views.\r\n\r\nGovernments may in good faith intervene to prevent the spreading of a\r\npolitical disease whose principles threaten social order; and, although\r\nthese fears are generally exaggerated and are often mere pretexts, it is\r\npossible that a state may believe its own institutions menaced. But in\r\nreligious disputes this is never the case; and Philip II. could have had\r\nno other object in interfering in the affairs of the League than to\r\nsubject France to his influence, or to dismember it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE X.\r\n\r\nDouble Wars, and the Danger of Undertaking Two Wars at Once.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe celebrated maxim of the Romans, not to undertake two great wars at\r\nthe same time, is so well known and so well appreciated as to spare the\r\nnecessity of demonstrating its wisdom.\r\n\r\nA government maybe compelled to maintain a war against two neighboring\r\nstates; but it will be extremely unfortunate if it does not find an ally\r\nto come to its aid, with a view to its own safety and the maintenance of\r\nthe political equilibrium. It will seldom be the case that the nations\r\nallied against it will have the same interest in the war and will enter\r\ninto it with all their resources; and, if one is only an auxiliary, it\r\nwill be an ordinary war.\r\n\r\nLouis XIV., Frederick the Great, the Emperor Alexander, and Napoleon,\r\nsustained gigantic struggles against united Europe. When such contests\r\narise from voluntary aggressions, they are proof of a capital error on\r\nthe part of the state which invites them; but if they arise from\r\nimperious and inevitable circumstances they must be met by seeking\r\nalliances, or by opposing such means of resistance as shall establish\r\nsomething like equality between the strength of the parties.\r\n\r\nThe great coalition against Louis XIV., nominally arising from his\r\ndesigns on Spain, had its real origin in previous aggressions which had\r\nalarmed his neighbors. To the combined forces of Europe he could only\r\noppose the faithful alliance of the Elector of Bavaria, and the more\r\nequivocal one of the Duke of Savoy, who, indeed, was not slow in adding\r\nto the number of his enemies. Frederick, with only the aid of the\r\nsubsidies of England, and fifty thousand auxiliaries from six different\r\nstates, sustained a war against the three most powerful monarchies of\r\nEurope: the division and folly of his opponents were his best friends.\r\n\r\nBoth these wars, as well as that sustained by Alexander in 1812, it was\r\nalmost impossible to avoid.\r\n\r\nFrance had the whole of Europe on its hands in 1793, in consequence of\r\nthe extravagant provocations of the Jacobins, and the Utopian ideas of\r\nthe Girondists, who boasted that with the support of the English fleets\r\nthey would defy all the kings in the world. The result of these absurd\r\ncalculations was a frightful upheaval of Europe, from which France\r\nmiraculously escaped.\r\n\r\nNapoleon is, to a certain degree, the only modern sovereign who has\r\nvoluntarily at the same time undertaken two, and even three, formidable\r\nwars,--with Spain, with England, and with Russia; but in the last case\r\nhe expected the aid of Austria and Prussia, to say nothing of that of\r\nTurkey and Sweden, upon which he counted with too much certainty; so\r\nthat the enterprise was not so adventurous on his part as has been\r\ngenerally supposed.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that there is a great distinction between a war made\r\nagainst a single state which is aided by a third acting as an auxiliary,\r\nand two wars conducted at the same time against two powerful nations in\r\nopposite quarters, who employ all their forces and resources. For\r\ninstance, the double contest of Napoleon in 1809 against Austria and\r\nSpain aided by England was a very different affair from a contest with\r\nAustria assisted by an auxiliary force of a given strength. These latter\r\ncontests belong to ordinary wars.\r\n\r\nIt follows, then, in general, that double wars should be avoided if\r\npossible, and, if cause of war be given by two states, it is more\r\nprudent to dissimulate or neglect the wrongs suffered from one of them,\r\nuntil a proper opportunity for redressing them shall arrive. The rule,\r\nhowever, is not without exception: the respective forces, the\r\nlocalities, the possibility of finding allies to restore, in a measure,\r\nequality of strength between the parties, are circumstances which will\r\ninfluence a government so threatened. We now have fulfilled our task, in\r\nnoting both the danger and the means of remedying it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMILITARY POLICY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already explained what we understand by this title. It embraces\r\nthe moral combinations relating to the operations of armies. If the\r\npolitical considerations which we have just discussed be also moral,\r\nthere are others which influence, in a certain degree, the conduct of a\r\nwar, which belong neither to diplomacy, strategy, nor tactics. We\r\ninclude these under the head of _Military Policy_.\r\n\r\nMilitary policy may be said to embrace all the combinations of any\r\nprojected war, except those relating to the diplomatic art and strategy;\r\nand, as their number is considerable, a separate article cannot be\r\nassigned to each without enlarging too much the limits of this work, and\r\nwithout deviating from my intention,--which is, not to give a treatise\r\non theses subjects, but to point out their relations to military\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nIndeed, in this class we may place the passions of the nation to be\r\nfought, their military system, their immediate means and their reserves,\r\ntheir financial resources, the attachment they bear to their government\r\nor their institutions, the character of the executive, the characters\r\nand military abilities of the commanders of their armies, the influence\r\nof cabinet councils or councils of war at the capital upon their\r\noperations, the system of war in favor with their staff, the established\r\nforce of the state and its armament, the military geography and\r\nstatistics of the state which is to be invaded, and, finally, the\r\nresources and obstacles of every kind likely to be met with, all of\r\nwhich are included neither in diplomacy nor in strategy.\r\n\r\nThere are no fixed rules on such subjects, except that the government\r\nshould neglect nothing in obtaining a knowledge of these details, and\r\nthat it is indispensable to take them into consideration in the\r\narrangement of all plans. We propose to sketch the principal points\r\nwhich ought to guide in this sort of combinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XI.\r\n\r\nMilitary Statistics and Geography.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the first of these sciences we understand the most thorough knowledge\r\npossible of the elements of power and military resources of the enemy\r\nwith whom we are called upon to contend; the second consists in the\r\ntopographical and strategic description of the theater of war, with all\r\nthe obstacles, natural or artificial, to be encountered, and the\r\nexamination of the permanent decisive points which may be presented in\r\nthe whole extent of the frontier or throughout the extent of the\r\ncountry. Besides the minister of war, the commanding general and his\r\nchief of staff should be afforded this information, under the penalty of\r\ncruel miscalculations in their plans, as happens frequently in our day,\r\ndespite the great strides civilized nations have taken in statistical,\r\ndiplomatic, geographical, and topographical sciences. I will cite two\r\nexamples of which I was cognizant. In 1796, Moreau's army, entering the\r\nBlack Forest, expected to find terrible mountains, frightful defiles and\r\nforests, and was greatly surprised to discover, after climbing the\r\ndeclivities of the plateau that slope to the Rhine, that these, with\r\ntheir spurs, were the only mountains, and that the country, from the\r\nsources of the Danube to Donauwerth, was a rich and level plain.\r\n\r\nThe second example was in 1813. Napoleon and his whole army supposed the\r\ninterior of Bohemia to be very mountainous,--whereas there is no\r\ndistrict in Europe more level, after the girdle of mountains surrounding\r\nit has been crossed, which may be done in a single march.\r\n\r\nAll European officers held the same erroneous opinions in reference to\r\nthe Balkan and the Turkish force in the interior. It seemed that it was\r\ngiven out at Constantinople that this province was an almost impregnable\r\nbarrier and the palladium of the empire,--an error which I, having lived\r\nin the Alps, did not entertain. Other prejudices, not less deeply\r\nrooted, have led to the belief that a people all the individuals of\r\nwhich are constantly armed would constitute a formidable militia and\r\nwould defend themselves to the last extremity. Experience has proved\r\nthat the old regulations which placed the elite of the Janissaries in\r\nthe frontier-cities of the Danube made the population of those cities\r\nmore warlike than the inhabitants of the interior. In fact, the projects\r\nof reform of the Sultan Mahmoud required the overthrow of the old\r\nsystem, and there was no time to replace it by the new: so that the\r\nempire was defenseless. Experience has constantly proved that a mere\r\nmultitude of brave men armed to the teeth make neither a good army nor a\r\nnational defense.\r\n\r\nLet us return to the necessity of knowing well the military geography\r\nand statistics of an empire. These sciences are not set forth in\r\ntreatises, and are yet to be developed. Lloyd, who wrote an essay upon\r\nthem, in describing the frontiers of the great states of Europe, was not\r\nfortunate in his maxims and predictions. He saw obstacles everywhere; he\r\nrepresents as impregnable the Austrian frontier on the Inn, between the\r\nTyrol and Passau, where Napoleon and Moreau maneuvered and triumphed\r\nwith armies of one hundred and fifty thousand men in 1800, 1805, and\r\n1809.\r\n\r\nBut, if these sciences are not publicly taught, the archives of the\r\nEuropean staff must necessarily possess many documents valuable for\r\ninstruction in them,--at least for the special staff school. Awaiting\r\nthe time when some studious officer, profiting by those published and\r\nunpublished documents, shall present Europe with a good military and\r\nstrategic geography, we may, thanks to the immense progress of\r\ntopography of late years, partially supply the want of it by the\r\nexcellent charts published in all European countries within the last\r\ntwenty years. At the beginning of the French Revolution topography was\r\nin its infancy: excepting the semi-topographical map of Cassini, the\r\nworks of Bakenberg alone merited the name. The Austrian and Prussian\r\nstaff schools, however, were good, and have since borne fruit. The\r\ncharts published recently at Vienna, at Berlin, Munich, Stuttgart, and\r\nParis, as well as those of the institute of Herder at Fribourg, promise\r\nto future generals immense resources unknown to their predecessors.\r\n\r\nMilitary statistics is not much better known than geography. We have but\r\nvague and superficial statements, from which the strength of armies and\r\nnavies is conjectured, and also the revenue supposed to be possessed by\r\na state,--which is far from being the knowledge necessary to plan\r\noperations. Our object here is not to discuss thoroughly these important\r\nsubjects, but to indicate them, as facilitating success in military\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XII.\r\n\r\nOther Causes which exercise an Influence upon the Success of a War.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the excited passions of a people are of themselves always a powerful\r\nenemy, both the general and his government should use their best efforts\r\nto allay them. We have nothing to add to what has been said on this\r\npoint under the head of national wars.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the general should do every thing to electrify his\r\nown soldiers, and to impart to them the same enthusiasm which he\r\nendeavors to repress in his adversaries. All armies are alike\r\nsusceptible of this spirit: the springs of action and means, only, vary\r\nwith the national character. Military eloquence is one means, and has\r\nbeen the subject of many a treatise. The proclamations of Napoleon and\r\nof Paskevitch, the addresses of the ancients to their soldiers, and\r\nthose of Suwaroff to men of still greater simplicity, are models of\r\ntheir different kinds. The eloquence of the Spanish Juntas, and the\r\nmiracles of the Madonna del Pilar, led to the same results by very\r\ndifferent means. In general, a cherished cause, and a general who\r\ninspires confidence by previous success, are powerful means of\r\nelectrifying an army and conducing to victory. Some dispute the\r\nadvantages of this enthusiasm, and prefer imperturbable coolness in\r\nbattle. Both have unmistakable advantages and disadvantages. Enthusiasm\r\nimpels to the performance of great actions: the difficulty is in\r\nmaintaining it constantly; and, when discouragement succeeds it,\r\ndisorder easily results.\r\n\r\nThe greater or less activity and boldness of the commanders of the\r\narmies are elements of success or failure, which cannot be submitted to\r\nrules. A cabinet and a commander ought to consider the intrinsic value\r\nof their troops, and that resulting from their organization as compared\r\nwith that of the enemy. A Russian general, commanding the most solidly\r\norganized troops in Europe, need not fear to undertake any thing against\r\nundisciplined and unorganized troops in an open country, however brave\r\nmay be its individuals.[1] Concert in action makes strength; order\r\nproduces this concert, and discipline insures order; and without\r\ndiscipline and order no success is possible. The Russian general would\r\nnot be so bold before European troops having the same instruction and\r\nnearly the same discipline as his own. Finally, a general may attempt\r\nwith a Mack as his antagonist what it would be madness to do with a\r\nNapoleon.\r\n\r\nThe action of a cabinet in reference to the control of armies influences\r\nthe boldness of their operations. A general whose genius and hands are\r\ntied by an Aulic council five hundred miles distant cannot be a match\r\nfor one who has liberty of action, other things being equal.\r\n\r\nAs to superiority in skill, it is one of the most certain pledges of\r\nvictory, all other things being equal. It is true that great generals\r\nhave often been beaten by inferior ones; but an exception does not make\r\na rule. An order misunderstood, a fortuitous event, may throw into the\r\nhands of the enemy all the chances of success which a skillful general\r\nhad prepared for himself by his maneuvers. But these are risks which\r\ncannot be foreseen nor avoided. Would it be fair on that account to\r\ndeny the influence of science and principles in ordinary affairs? This\r\nrisk even proves the triumph of the principles, for it happens that they\r\nare applied accidentally by the army against which it was intended to\r\napply them, and are the cause of its success. But, in admitting this\r\ntruth, it may be said that it is an argument against science; this\r\nobjection is not well founded, for a general's science consists in\r\nproviding for his side all the chances possible to be foreseen, and of\r\ncourse cannot extend to the caprices of destiny. Even if the number of\r\nbattles gained by skillful maneuvers did not exceed the number due to\r\naccident, it would not invalidate my assertion.\r\n\r\nIf the skill of a general is one of the surest elements of victory, it\r\nwill readily be seen that the judicious selection of generals is one of\r\nthe most delicate points in the science of government and one of the\r\nmost essential parts of the military policy of a state. Unfortunately,\r\nthis choice is influenced by so many petty passions, that chance, rank,\r\nage, favor, party spirit, jealousy, will have as much to do with it as\r\nthe public interest and justice. This subject is so important that we\r\nwill devote to it a separate article.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Irregular troops supported by disciplined troops may be of\r\nthe greatest value, in destroying convoys, intercepting communication,\r\n&c., and may--as in the case of the French in 1812--make a retreat very\r\ndisastrous.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XIII.\r\n\r\nMilitary Institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most important points of the military policy of a state is\r\nthe nature of its military institutions. A good army commanded by a\r\ngeneral of ordinary capacity may accomplish great feats; a bad army with\r\na good general may do equally well; but an army will certainly do a\r\ngreat deal more if its own superiority and that of the general be\r\ncombined.\r\n\r\nTwelve essential conditions concur in making a perfect army:--\r\n\r\n1. To have a good recruiting-system;\r\n\r\n2. A good organization;\r\n\r\n8. A well-organized system of national reserves;\r\n\r\n4. Good instruction of officers and men in drill and internal duties as\r\nwell as those of a campaign;\r\n\r\n5. A strict but not humiliating discipline, and a spirit of\r\nsubordination and punctuality, based on conviction rather than on the\r\nformalities of the service;\r\n\r\n6. A well-digested system of rewards, suitable to excite emulation;\r\n\r\n7. The special arms of engineering and artillery to be well instructed;\r\n\r\n8. An armament superior, if possible, to that of the enemy, both as to\r\ndefensive and offensive arms;\r\n\r\n9. A general staff capable of applying these elements, and having an\r\norganization calculated to advance the theoretical and practical\r\neducation of its officers;\r\n\r\n10. A good system for the commissariat, hospitals, and of general\r\nadministration;\r\n\r\n11. A good system of assignment to command, and of directing the\r\nprincipal operations of war;\r\n\r\n12. Exciting and keeping alive the military spirit of the people.\r\n\r\nTo these conditions might be added a good system of clothing and\r\nequipment; for, if this be of less direct importance on the field of\r\nbattle, it nevertheless has a bearing upon the preservation of the\r\ntroops; and it is always a great object to economize the lives and\r\nhealth of veterans.\r\n\r\nNone of the above twelve conditions can be neglected without grave\r\ninconvenience. A fine army, well drilled and disciplined, but without\r\nnational reserves, and unskillfully led, suffered Prussia to fall in\r\nfifteen days under the attacks of Napoleon. On the other hand, it has\r\noften been seen of how much advantage it is for a state to have a good\r\narmy. It was the care and skill of Philip and Alexander in forming and\r\ninstructing their phalanxes and rendering them easy to move, and capable\r\nof the most rapid maneuvers, which enabled the Macedonians to subjugate\r\nIndia and Persia with a handful of choice troops. It was the excessive\r\nlove of his father for soldiers which procured for Frederick the Great\r\nan army capable of executing his great enterprises.\r\n\r\nA government which neglects its army under any pretext whatever is thus\r\nculpable in the eyes of posterity, since it prepares humiliation for its\r\nstandards and its country, instead of by a different course preparing\r\nfor it success. We are far from saying that a government should\r\nsacrifice every thing to the army, for this would be absurd; but it\r\nought to make the army the object of its constant care; and if the\r\nprince has not a military education it will be very difficult for him to\r\nfulfill his duty in this respect. In this case--which is, unfortunately,\r\nof too frequent occurrence--the defect must be supplied by wise\r\ninstitutions, at the head of which are to be placed a good system of the\r\ngeneral staff, a good system of recruiting, and a good system of\r\nnational reserves.\r\n\r\nThere are, indeed, forms of government which do not always allow the\r\nexecutive the power of adopting the best systems. If the armies of the\r\nRoman and French republics, and those of Louis XIV. and Frederick of\r\nPrussia, prove that a good military system and a skillful direction of\r\noperations may be found in governments the most opposite in principle,\r\nit cannot be doubted that, in the present state of the world, the form\r\nof government exercises a great influence in the development of the\r\nmilitary strength of a nation and the value of its troops.\r\n\r\nWhen the control of the public funds is in the hands of those affected\r\nby local interest or party spirit, they may be so over-scrupulous and\r\npenurious as to take all power to carry on the war from the executive,\r\nwhom very many people seem to regard as a public enemy rather than as a\r\nchief devoted to all the national interests.\r\n\r\nThe abuse of badly-understood public liberties may also contribute to\r\nthis deplorable result. Then it will be impossible for the most\r\nfar-sighted administration to prepare in advance for a great war,\r\nwhether it be demanded by the most important interests of the country at\r\nsome future time, or whether it be immediate and necessary to resist\r\nsudden aggressions.\r\n\r\nIn the futile hope of rendering themselves popular, may not the members\r\nof an elective legislature, the majority of whom cannot be Richelieus,\r\nPitts, or Louvois, in a misconceived spirit of economy, allow the\r\ninstitutions necessary for a large, well-appointed, and disciplined army\r\nto fall into decay? Deceived by the seductive fallacies of an\r\nexaggerated philanthropy, may they not end in convincing themselves and\r\ntheir constituents that the pleasures of peace are always preferable to\r\nthe more statesmanlike preparations for war?\r\n\r\nI am far from advising that states should always have the hand upon the\r\nsword and always be established on a war-footing: such a condition of\r\nthings would be a scourge for the human race, and would not be possible,\r\nexcept under conditions not existing in all countries. I simply mean\r\nthat civilized governments ought always to be ready to carry on a war in\r\na short time,--that they should never be found unprepared. And the\r\nwisdom of their institutions may do as much in this work of preparation\r\nas foresight in their administration and the perfection of their system\r\nof military policy.\r\n\r\nIf, in ordinary times, under the rule of constitutional forms,\r\ngovernments subjected to all the changes of an elective legislature are\r\nless suitable than others for the creation or preparation of a\r\nformidable military power, nevertheless, in great crises these\r\ndeliberative bodies have sometimes attained very different results, and\r\nhave concurred in developing to the full extent the national strength.\r\nStill, the small number of such instances in history makes rather a list\r\nof exceptional cases, in which a tumultuous and violent assembly, placed\r\nunder the necessity of conquering or perishing, has profited by the\r\nextraordinary enthusiasm of the nation to save the country and\r\nthemselves at the same time by resorting to the most terrible measures\r\nand by calling to its aid an unlimited dictatorial power, which\r\noverthrew both liberty and law under the pretext of defending them. Here\r\nit is the dictatorship, or the absolute and monstrous usurpation of\r\npower, rather than the form of the deliberative assembly, which is the\r\ntrue cause of the display of energy. What happened in the Convention\r\nafter the fall of Robespierre and the terrible Committee of Public\r\nSafety proves this, as well as the Chambers of 1815. Now, if the\r\ndictatorial power, placed in the hands of a few, has always been a plank\r\nof safety in great crises, it seems natural to draw the conclusion that\r\ncountries controlled by elective assemblies must be politically and\r\nmilitarily weaker than pure monarchies, although in other respects they\r\npresent decided advantages.\r\n\r\nIt is particularly necessary to watch over the preservation of armies in\r\nthe interval of a long peace, for then they are most likely to\r\ndegenerate. It is important to foster the military spirit in the armies,\r\nand to exercise them in great maneuvers, which, though but faintly\r\nresembling those of actual war, still are of decided advantage in\r\npreparing them for war. It is not less important to prevent them from\r\nbecoming effeminate, which may be done by employing them in labors\r\nuseful for the defense of the country.\r\n\r\nThe isolation in garrisons of troops by regiments is one of the worst\r\npossible systems, and the Russian and Prussian system of divisions and\r\npermanent corps d'armée seems to be much preferable. In general terms,\r\nthe Russian army now may be presented as a model in many respects; and\r\nif in many points its customs would be useless and impracticable\r\nelsewhere, it must be admitted that many good institutions might well be\r\ncopied from it.\r\n\r\nAs to rewards and promotion, it is essential to respect long service,\r\nand at the same time to open a way for merit. Three-fourths of the\r\npromotions in each grade should be made according to the roster, and the\r\nremaining fourth reserved for those distinguished for merit and zeal. On\r\nthe contrary, in time of war the regular order of promotion should be\r\nsuspended, or at least reduced to a third of the promotions, leaving the\r\nother two-thirds for brilliant conduct and marked services.\r\n\r\nThe superiority of armament may increase the chances of success in war:\r\nit does not, of itself, gain battles, but it is a great element of\r\nsuccess. Every one can recall how nearly fatal to the French at Bylau\r\nand Marengo was their great inferiority in artillery. We may also refer\r\nto the great gain of the heavy French cavalry in the resumption of the\r\ncuirass, which they had for so long thrown aside. Every one knows the\r\ngreat advantage of the lance. Doubtless, as skirmishers lancers would\r\nnot be more effectual than hussars, but when charging in line it is a\r\nvery different affair. How many brave cavalry soldiers have been the\r\nvictims of the prejudice they bore against the lance because it was a\r\nlittle more trouble to carry than a saber!\r\n\r\nThe armament of armies is still susceptible of great improvements; the\r\nstate which shall take the lead in making them will secure great\r\nadvantages. There is little left to be desired in artillery; but the\r\noffensive and defensive arms of infantry and cavalry deserve the\r\nattention of a provident government.\r\n\r\nThe new inventions of the last twenty years seem to threaten a great\r\nrevolution in army organization, armament, and tactics. Strategy alone\r\nwill remain unaltered, with its principles the same as under the Scipios\r\nand Cæsars, Frederick and Napoleon, since they are independent of the\r\nnature of the arms and the organization of the troops.\r\n\r\nThe means of destruction are approaching perfection with frightful\r\nrapidity.[2] The Congreve rockets, the effect and direction of which it\r\nis said the Austrians can now regulate,--the shrapnel howitzers, which\r\nthrow a stream of canister as far as the range of a bullet,--the Perkins\r\nsteam-guns, which vomit forth as many balls as a battalion,--will\r\nmultiply the chances of destruction, as though the hecatombs of Eylau,\r\nBorodino, Leipsic, and Waterloo were not sufficient to decimate the\r\nEuropean races.\r\n\r\nIf governments do not combine in a congress to proscribe these\r\ninventions of destruction, there will be no course left but to make the\r\nhalf of an army consist of cavalry with cuirasses, in order to capture\r\nwith great rapidity these machines; and the infantry, even, will be\r\nobliged to resume its armor of the Middle Ages, without which a\r\nbattalion will be destroyed before engaging the enemy.\r\n\r\nWe may then see again the famous men-at-arms all covered with armor,\r\nand horses also will require the same protection.\r\n\r\nWhile there is doubt about the realization of these fears, it is,\r\nhowever, certain that artillery and pyrotechny have made advances which\r\nshould lead us to think of modifying the deep formation so much abused\r\nby Napoleon. We will recur to this in the chapter on Tactics.\r\n\r\nWe will here recapitulate, in a few words, the essential bases of the\r\nmilitary policy which ought to be adopted by a wise government.\r\n\r\n1. The prince should receive an education both political and military.\r\nHe will more probably find men of administrative ability in his councils\r\nthan good statesmen or soldiers; and hence he should be both of the\r\nlatter himself.\r\n\r\n2. If the prince in person does not lead his armies, it will be his\r\nfirst duty and his nearest interest to have his place well supplied. He\r\nmust confide the glory of his reign and the safety of his states to the\r\ngeneral most capable of directing his armies.\r\n\r\n3. The permanent army should not only always be upon a respectable\r\nfooting, but it should be capable of being doubled, if necessary, by\r\nreserves, which should always be prepared. Its instruction and\r\ndiscipline should be of a high character, as well as its organization;\r\nits armament should at least be as good as that of its neighbors, and\r\nsuperior if possible.\r\n\r\n4. The matériel of war should also be upon the best footing, and\r\nabundant. The reserves should be stored in the depots and arsenals.\r\nNational jealousy should not be allowed to prevent the adoption of all\r\nimprovements in this matériel made in other countries.\r\n\r\n5. It is necessary that the study of the military sciences should be\r\nencouraged and rewarded, as well as courage and zeal. The scientific\r\nmilitary corps should be esteemed and honored: this is the only way of\r\nsecuring for the army men of merit and genius.\r\n\r\n6. The general staff in times of peace should be employed in labors\r\npreparatory for all possible contingencies of war. Its archives should\r\nbe furnished with numerous historical details of the past, and with all\r\nstatistical, geographical, topographical, and strategic treatises and\r\npapers for the present and future. Hence it is essential that the chief\r\nof this corps, with a number of its officers, should be permanently\r\nstationed at the capital in time of peace, and the war-office should be\r\nsimply that of the general staff, except that there should be a secret\r\ndepartment for those documents to be concealed from the subalterns of\r\nthe corps.\r\n\r\n7. Nothing should be neglected to acquire a knowledge of the geography\r\nand the military statistics of other states, so as to know their\r\nmaterial and moral capacity for attack and defense, as well as the\r\nstrategic advantages of the two parties. Distinguished officers should\r\nbe employed in these scientific labors, and should be rewarded when they\r\nacquit themselves with marked ability.\r\n\r\n8. When a war is decided upon, it becomes necessary to prepare, not an\r\nentire plan of operations,--which is always impossible,--but a system of\r\noperations in reference to a prescribed aim; to provide a base, as well\r\nas all the material means necessary to guarantee the success of the\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\n9. The system of operations ought to be determined by the object of the\r\nwar, the kind of forces of the enemy, the nature and resources of the\r\ncountry, the characters of the nations and of their chiefs, whether of\r\nthe army or of the state. In fine, it should be based upon the moral and\r\nmaterial means of attack or defense which the enemy may be able to bring\r\ninto action; and it ought to take into consideration the probable\r\nalliances that may obtain in favor of or against either of the parties\r\nduring the war.\r\n\r\n10. The financial condition of a nation is to be weighed among the\r\nchances of a war. Still, it would be dangerous to constantly attribute\r\nto this condition the importance attached to it by Frederick the Great\r\nin the history of his times. He was probably right at his epoch, when\r\narmies were chiefly recruited by voluntary enlistment, when the last\r\ncrown brought the last soldier; but when national levies are well\r\norganised money will no longer exercise the same influence,--at least\r\nfor one or two campaigns. If England has proved that money will procure\r\nsoldiers and auxiliaries, France has proved that love of country and\r\nhonor are equally productive, and that, when necessary, war may be made\r\nto support war. France, indeed, in the fertility of her soil and the\r\nenthusiasm of her leaders, possessed sources of temporary power which\r\ncannot be adopted as a general base of a system; but the results of its\r\nefforts were none the less striking. Every year the numerous reports of\r\nthe cabinet of London, and particularly of M. d'Yvernois, announced that\r\nFrance was about to break down for want of money, while Napoleon had\r\n200,000,000 francs[3] in the vaults of the Tuileries, all the while\r\nmeeting the expenses of the government, including the pay of his armies.\r\n\r\nA power might be overrunning with gold and still defend itself very\r\nbadly. History, indeed, proves that the richest nation is neither the\r\nstrongest nor the happiest. Iron weighs at least as much as gold in the\r\nscales of military strength. Still, we must admit that a happy\r\ncombination of wise military institutions, of patriotism, of\r\nwell-regulated finances, of internal wealth and public credit, imparts\r\nto a nation the greatest strength and makes it best capable of\r\nsustaining a long war.\r\n\r\nA volume would be necessary to discuss all the circumstances under which\r\na nation may develop more or less strength, either by its gold or iron,\r\nand to determine the cases when war may be expected to support war. This\r\nresult can only be obtained by carrying the army into the territory of\r\nthe enemy; and all countries are not equally capable of furnishing\r\nresources to an assailant.\r\n\r\nWe need not extend further the investigation of these subjects which are\r\nnot directly connected with the art of war. It is sufficient for our\r\npurpose to indicate their relations to a projected war; and it will be\r\nfor the statesman to develop the modifications which circumstances and\r\nlocalities may make in these relations.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: It will be recollected that the author wrote this many\r\nyears ago, since which time the inventive genius of the age has been\r\nattentively directed to the improvement of fire-arms.

Whatever may be the decision on this point, it is certain\r\nthat if the prince possess the genius of Frederick, Peter the Great, or\r\nNapoleon, he will be far from leaving to his generals the honor of\r\nperforming great actions which he might do himself; for in this he would\r\nbe untrue to his own glory and to the well-being of the country.\r\n\r\nAs it is not our mission to discuss the question whether it is more\r\nfortunate for a nation to have a warlike or a peace-loving prince,\r\n(which is a philanthropic question, foreign to our subject,) we will\r\nonly state upon this point that, with equal merit and chances in other\r\nrespects, a sovereign will always have an advantage over a general who\r\nis himself not the head of a state. Leaving out of the question that he\r\nis responsible only to himself for his bold enterprises, he may do much\r\nby the certainty he has of being able to dispose of all the public\r\nresources for the attainment of his end. He also possesses the powerful\r\naccessory of his favor, of recompenses and punishments; all will be\r\ndevoted to the execution of his orders, and to insure for his\r\nenterprises the greatest success; no jealousy will interfere with the\r\nexecution of his projects, or at least its exhibition will be rare and\r\nin secondary operations. Here are, certainly, sufficient motives to\r\ninduce a prince to lead his armies, if he possess military capacity and\r\nthe contest be of a magnitude worthy of him. But if he possess no\r\nmilitary ability, if his character be feeble, and he be easily\r\ninfluenced, his presence with the army, instead of producing good\r\nresults, will open the way for all manner of intrigues. Each one will\r\npresent his projects to him; and, as he will not have the experience\r\nnecessary to estimate them according to their merits, he will submit his\r\njudgment to that of his intimates. His general, interfered with and\r\nopposed in all his enterprises, will be unable to achieve success, even\r\nif he have the requisite ability. It may be said that a sovereign might\r\naccompany the army and not interfere with his general, but, on the\r\ncontrary, aid him with all the weight of his influence. In this case his\r\npresence might be productive of good results, but it also might lead to\r\ngreat embarrassment. If the army were turned and cut off from its\r\ncommunications, and obliged to extricate itself, sword in hand, what sad\r\nresults might not follow from the presence of the sovereign at\r\nhead-quarters!\r\n\r\nWhen a prince feels the necessity of taking the field at the head of his\r\narmies, but lacks the necessary self-confidence to assume the supreme\r\ndirection of affairs, the best course will be that adopted by the\r\nPrussian government with Blücher,--viz.; he should be accompanied by two\r\ngenerals of the best capacity, one of them a man of executive ability,\r\nthe other a well-instructed staff officer. If this trinity be\r\nharmonious, it may yield excellent results, as in the case of the army\r\nof Silesia in 1813.\r\n\r\nThe same system might apply in the case where the sovereign judges it\r\nproper to intrust the command to a prince of his house, as has\r\nfrequently happened since the time of Louis XIV. It has often occurred\r\nthat the prince possessed only the titular command, and that an adviser,\r\nwho in reality commanded, was imposed upon him. This was the case with\r\nthe Duke of Orleans and Marsin at the famous battle of Turin, afterward\r\nwith the Duke of Burgundy and Vendôme at the battle of Audenarde, and, I\r\nthink, also at Ulm with the Archduke Ferdinand and Mack. This system is\r\ndeplorable, since no one is responsible for what is done. It is known\r\nthat at the battle of Turin the Duke of Orleans exhibited more sagacity\r\nthan Marsin, and it became necessary for the latter to show full secret\r\nauthority from the king before the prince would yield his judgment and\r\nallow the battle to be lost. So at Ulm the archduke displayed more skill\r\nand courage than Mack, who was to be his mentor.\r\n\r\nIf the prince possess the genius and experience of the Archduke Charles,\r\nhe should be invested with the untrammeled command, and be allowed full\r\nselection of his instruments. If he have not yet acquired the same\r\ntitles to command, he may then be provided with an educated general of\r\nthe staff, and another general distinguished for his talent in\r\nexecution; but in no case will it be wise to invest either of these\r\ncounselors with more authority than a voice in consultation.\r\n\r\nWe have already said that if the prince do not conduct his armies in\r\nperson, his most important duty will be to have the position of\r\ncommander well filled,--which, unfortunately, is not always done.\r\nWithout going back to ancient times, it will be sufficient to recall the\r\nmore modern examples under Louis XIV. and Louis XV. The merit of Prince\r\nEugene was estimated by his deformed figure, and this drove him (the\r\nablest commander of his time) into the ranks of the enemy. After\r\nLouvois' death, Tallard, Marsin, and Villeroi filled the places of\r\nTurenne, Condé, and Luxembourg, and subsequently Soubise and Clermont\r\nsucceeded Marshal Saxe. Between the fashionable selections made in the\r\nSaloons of the Pompadours and Dubarrys, and Napoleon's preference for\r\nmere soldiers, there are many gradations, and the margin is wide enough\r\nto afford the least intelligent government means of making rational\r\nnominations; but, in all ages, human weaknesses will exercise an\r\ninfluence in one way or another, and artifice will often carry off the\r\nprize from modest or timid merit, which awaits a call for its services.\r\nBut, leaving out of consideration all these influences, it will be\r\nprofitable to inquire in what respects this choice of a commander will\r\nbe difficult, even when the executive shall be most anxious to make it a\r\njudicious one. In the first place, to make choice of a skillful general\r\nrequires either that the person who makes the selection shall be a\r\nmilitary man, able to form an intelligent opinion, or that he should be\r\nguided by the opinions of others, which opens the way to the improper\r\ninfluence of cliques. The embarrassment is certainly less when there is\r\nat hand a general already illustrious by many victories; but, outside of\r\nthe fact that every general is not a great leader because he has gained\r\na battle, (for instance, Jourdan, Scherer, and many others,) it is not\r\nalways the case that a victorious general is at the disposition of the\r\ngovernment. It may well happen that after a long period of peace, there\r\nmay not be a single general in Europe who has commanded in chief. In\r\nthis case, it will be difficult to decide whether one general is better\r\nthan another. Those who have served long in peace will be at the head of\r\ntheir arms or corps, and will have the rank appropriate for this\r\nposition; but will they always be the most capable of filling it?\r\nMoreover, the intercourse of the heads of a government with their\r\nsubordinates is generally so rare and transient, that it is not\r\nastonishing they should experience difficulty in assigning men to their\r\nappropriate positions. The judgment of the prince, misled by\r\nappearances, may err, and, with the purest intentions, he may well be\r\ndeceived in his selections.\r\n\r\nOne of the surest means of escaping this misfortune would seem to be in\r\nrealizing the beautiful fiction of Fénélon in Telemachus, by finding a\r\nfaithful, sincere, and generous Philocles, who, standing between the\r\nprince and all aspirants for the command, would be able, by means of his\r\nmore direct relations to the public, to enlighten the monarch in\r\nreference to selections of individuals best recommended by their\r\ncharacter and abilities. But will this faithful friend never yield to\r\npersonal affections? Will he be always free from prejudice? Suwaroff was\r\nrejected by Potemkin on account of his appearance, and it required all\r\nthe art of Catherine to secure a regiment for the man who afterward shed\r\nso much luster upon the Russian arms.\r\n\r\nIt has been thought that public opinion is the best guide; but nothing\r\ncould be more dangerous. It voted Dumouriez to be a Cæsar, when he was\r\nignorant of the great operations of war. Would it have placed Bonaparte\r\nat the head of the army of Italy, when he was known only by two\r\ndirectors? Still, it must be admitted that, if not infallible, public\r\nsentiment is not to be despised, particularly if it survive great crises\r\nand the experience of events.\r\n\r\nThe most essential qualities for a general will always be as\r\nfollow:--First, _A high moral courage, capable of great resolutions_;\r\nSecondly, _A physical courage which takes no account of danger_. His\r\nscientific or military acquirements are secondary to the above-mentioned\r\ncharacteristics, though if great they will be valuable auxiliaries. It\r\nis not necessary that he should be a man of vast erudition. His\r\nknowledge may be limited, but it should be thorough, and he should be\r\nperfectly grounded in the principles at the base of the art of war. Next\r\nin importance come the qualities of his personal character. A man who is\r\ngallant, just, firm, upright, capable of esteeming merit in others\r\ninstead of being jealous of it, and skillful in making this merit\r\nconduce to his own glory, will always be a good general, and may even\r\npass for a great man. Unfortunately, the disposition to do justice to\r\nmerit in others is not the most common quality: mediocre minds are\r\nalways jealous, and inclined to surround themselves with persons of\r\nlittle ability, fearing the reputation of being led, and not realizing\r\nthat the nominal commander of an army always receives almost all the\r\nglory of its success, even when least entitled to it.\r\n\r\nThe question has often been discussed, whether it is preferable to\r\nassign to the command a general of long experience in service with\r\ntroops, or an officer of the staff, having generally but little\r\nexperience in the management of troops. It is beyond question that war\r\nis a distinct science of itself, and that it is quite possible to be\r\nable to combine operations skillfully without ever having led a regiment\r\nagainst an enemy. Peter the Great, Condé, Frederick, and Napoleon are\r\ninstances of it. It cannot, then, be denied that an officer from the\r\nstaff may as well as any other prove to be a great general, but it will\r\nnot be because he has grown gray in the duties of a quartermaster that\r\nhe will be capable of the supreme command, but because he has a natural\r\ngenius for war and possesses the requisite characteristics. So, also, a\r\ngeneral from the ranks of the infantry or cavalry may be as capable of\r\nconducting a campaign as the most profound tactician. So this question\r\ndoes not admit of a definite answer either in the affirmative or\r\nnegative, since almost all will depend upon the personal qualities of\r\nthe individuals; but the following remarks will be useful in leading to\r\na rational conclusion:--\r\n\r\n1. A general, selected from the general staff, engineers, or artillery,\r\nwho has commanded a division or a corps d'armée, will, with equal\r\nchances, be superior to one who is familiar with the service of but one\r\narm or special corps.\r\n\r\n2. A general from the line, who has made a study of the science of war,\r\nwill be equally fitted for the command.\r\n\r\n3. That the character of the man is above all other requisites in a\r\ncommander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nFinally, He will be a good general in whom are found united the\r\nrequisite personal characteristics and a thorough knowledge of the\r\nprinciples of the art of war.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of always selecting a good general has led to the\r\nformation of a good general staff, which being near the general may\r\nadvise him, and thus exercise a beneficial influence over the\r\noperations. A well-instructed general staff is one of the most useful of\r\norganizations; but care must be observed to prevent the introduction\r\ninto it of false principles, as in this case it might prove fatal.\r\n\r\nFrederick, when he established the military school of Potsdam, never\r\nthought it would lead to the \"right shoulder forward\" of General\r\nRuchel,[4] and to the teaching that the oblique order is the infallible\r\nrule for gaining all battles. How true it is that there is but a step\r\nfrom the sublime to the ridiculous!\r\n\r\nMoreover, there ought to exist perfect harmony between the general and\r\nhis chief of staff; and, if it be true that the latter should be a man\r\nof recognized ability, it is also proper to give the general the choice\r\nof the men who are to be his advisers. To impose a chief of staff upon a\r\ngeneral would be to create anarchy and want of harmony; while to permit\r\nhim to select a cipher for that position would be still more dangerous;\r\nfor if he be himself a man of little ability, indebted to favor or\r\nfortune for his station, the selection will be of vital importance. The\r\nbest means to avoid these dangers is to give the general the option of\r\nseveral designated officers, all of undoubted ability.\r\n\r\nIt has been thought, in succession, in almost all armies, that frequent\r\ncouncils of war, by aiding the commander with their advice, give more\r\nweight and effect to the direction of military operations. Doubtless, if\r\nthe commander were a Soubise, a Clermont, or a Mack, he might well find\r\nin a council of war opinions more valuable than his own; the majority of\r\nthe opinions given might be preferable to his; but what success could be\r\nexpected from operations conducted by others than those who have\r\noriginated and arranged them? What must be the result of an operation\r\nwhich is but partially understood by the commander, since it is not his\r\nown conception?\r\n\r\nI have undergone a pitiable experience as prompter at head-quarters, and\r\nno one has a better appreciation of the value of such services than\r\nmyself; and it is particularly in a council of war that such a part is\r\nabsurd. The greater the number and the higher the rank of the military\r\nofficers who compose the council, the more difficult will it be to\r\naccomplish the triumph of truth and reason, however small be the amount\r\nof dissent.\r\n\r\nWhat would have been the action of a council of war to which Napoleon\r\nproposed the movement of Arcola, the crossing of the Saint-Bernard, the\r\nmaneuver at Ulm, or that at Gera and Jena? The timid would have regarded\r\nthem as rash, even to madness, others would have seen a thousand\r\ndifficulties of execution, and all would have concurred in rejecting\r\nthem; and if, on the contrary, they had been adopted, and had been\r\nexecuted by any one but Napoleon, would they not certainly have proved\r\nfailures?\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, councils of war are a deplorable resource, and can be\r\nuseful only when concurring in opinion with the commander, in which case\r\nthey may give him more confidence in his own judgment, and, in addition,\r\nmay assure him that his lieutenants, being of his opinion, will use\r\nevery means to insure the success of the movement. This is the only\r\nadvantage of a council of war, which, moreover, should be simply\r\nconsultative and have no further authority; but if, instead of this\r\nharmony, there should be difference of opinion, it can only produce\r\nunfortunate results.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I think it safe to conclude that the best means of\r\norganizing the command of an army, in default of a general approved by\r\nexperience, is--\r\n\r\n1st. To give the command to a man of tried bravery, bold in the fight,\r\nand of unshaken firmness in danger.\r\n\r\n2d. To assign, as his chief of staff, a man of high ability, of open and\r\nfaithful character, between whom and the commander there may be perfect\r\nharmony. The victor will gain so much glory that he can spare some to\r\nthe friend who has contributed to his success. In this way Blücher,\r\naided by Gneisenau and Muffling, gained glory which probably he would\r\nnot have been able to do of himself. It is true that this double command\r\nis more objectionable than an undivided one when a state has a Napoleon,\r\na Frederick, or a Suwaroff to fill it; but when there is no great\r\ngeneral to lead the armies it is certainly the preferable system.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this important branch of the subject, another means of\r\ninfluencing military operations--viz.: that of a council of war at the\r\nseat of government--deserves notice. Louvois for a long time directed\r\nfrom Paris the armies of Louis XIV., and with success. Carnot, also,\r\nfrom Paris directed the armies of the Republic: in 1793 he did well, and\r\nsaved France; in 1794 his action was at first very unfortunate, but he\r\nrepaired his faults afterward by chance; in 1796 he was completely at\r\nfault. It is to be observed, however, that both Louvois and Carnot\r\nindividually controlled the armies, and that there was no council of\r\nwar. The Aulic council, sitting in Vienna, was often intrusted with the\r\nduty of directing the operations of the armies; and there has never been\r\nbut one opinion in Europe as to its fatal influence. Whether this\r\nopinion is right or wrong, the Austrian generals alone are able to\r\ndecide. My own opinion is that the functions of such a body in this\r\nconnection should be limited to the adoption of a general plan of\r\noperations. By this I do not mean a plan which should trace out the\r\ncampaign in detail, restricting the generals and compelling them to give\r\nbattle without regard to circumstances, but a plan which should\r\ndetermine the object of the campaign, the nature of the operations,\r\nwhether offensive or defensive, the material means to be applied to\r\nthese first enterprises, afterward for the reserves, and finally for the\r\nlevies which may be necessary if the country be invaded. These points,\r\nit is true, should be discussed in a council of both generals and\r\nministers, and to these points should the control of the council be\r\nlimited; for if it should not only order the general in command to march\r\nto Vienna or to Paris, but should also have the presumption to indicate\r\nthe manner in which he should maneuver to attain this object, the\r\nunfortunate general would certainly be beaten, and the whole\r\nresponsibility of his reverses should fall upon the shoulders of those\r\nwho, hundreds of miles distant, took upon themselves the duty of\r\ndirecting the army,--a duty so difficult for any one, even upon the\r\nscene of operations.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: General Ruchel thought at the battle of Jena that he could\r\nsave the army by giving the command to advance the right shoulder in\r\norder to form an oblique line.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XV.\r\n\r\nThe Military Spirit of Nations, and the Morale of Armies.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe adoption of the best regulations for the organization of an army\r\nwould be in vain if the government did not at the same time cultivate a\r\nmilitary spirit in its citizens. It may well be the case in London,\r\nsituated on an island and protected from invasion by its immense fleets,\r\nthat the title of a rich banker should be preferred to a military\r\ndecoration; but a continental nation imbued with the sentiments and\r\nhabits of the tradesmen of London or the bankers of Paris would sooner\r\nor later fall a prey to its neighbors. It was to the union of the civic\r\nvirtues and military spirit fostered by their institutions that the\r\nRomans were indebted for their grandeur; and when they lost these\r\nvirtues, and when, no longer regarding the military service as an honor\r\nas well as a duty, they relinquished it to mercenary Goths and Gauls,\r\nthe fall of the empire became inevitable. It is doubtless true that\r\nwhatever increases the prosperity of the country should be neither\r\nneglected nor despised; it is also necessary to honor the branches of\r\nindustry which are the first instruments of this prosperity; but they\r\nshould always be secondary to the great institutions which make up the\r\nstrength of states in encouraging the cultivation of the manly and\r\nheroic virtues. Policy and justice both agree on this point; for,\r\nwhatever Boileau may say, it is certainly more glorious to confront\r\ndeath in the footsteps of the Cæsars than to fatten upon the public\r\nmiseries by gambling on the vicissitudes of the national credit.\r\nMisfortune will certainly fall upon the land where the wealth of the\r\ntax-gatherer or the greedy gambler in stocks stands, in public\r\nestimation, above the uniform of the brave man who sacrifices his life,\r\nhealth, or fortune to the defense of his country.\r\n\r\nThe first means of encouraging the military spirit is to invest the army\r\nwith all possible social and public consideration. The second means is\r\nto give the preference to those who have rendered services to the state,\r\nin filling any vacancies in the administrative departments of the\r\ngovernment, or even to require a certain length of military service as a\r\nqualification for certain offices. A comparison of the ancient military\r\ninstitutions of Rome with those of Russia and Prussia, is a subject\r\nworthy of serious attention; and it would also be interesting to\r\ncontrast them with the doctrines of modern theorists, who declare\r\nagainst the employment of officers of the army in other public\r\nfunctions, and who wish for none but rhetoricians in the important\r\noffices of administration.[5] It is true that many public employments\r\ndemand a special course of study; but cannot the soldier, in the\r\nabundant leisure of peace, prepare himself for the career he would\r\nprefer after having fulfilled his debt to his country in the profession\r\nof arms? If these administrative offices were conferred upon officers\r\nretired from the army in a grade not lower than that of captain, would\r\nit not be a stimulant for officers to attain that rank, and would it not\r\nlead them, when in garrisons, to find their recreations elsewhere than\r\nin the theaters and public clubs?\r\n\r\nIt may be possible that this facility of transfer from the military to\r\nthe civil service would be rather injurious than favorable to a high\r\nmilitary spirit, and that to encourage this spirit it would be expedient\r\nto place the profession of the soldier above all others. This was the\r\nearly practice of the Mamelukes and Janissaries. Their soldiers were\r\nbought at the age of about seven years, and were educated in the idea\r\nthat they were to die by their standards. Even the English--so jealous\r\nof their rights--contract, in enlisting as soldiers, the obligation for\r\nthe whole length of their lives, and the Russian, in enlisting for\r\ntwenty-five years, does what is almost equivalent. In such armies, and\r\nin those recruited by voluntary enlistments, perhaps it would not be\r\nadvisable to tolerate this fusion of military and civil offices; but\r\nwhere the military service is a temporary duty imposed upon the people,\r\nthe case is different, and the old Roman laws which required a previous\r\nmilitary service of ten years in any aspirant for the public\r\nemployments, seem to be best calculated to preserve the military\r\nspirit,--particularly in this age, when the attainment of material\r\ncomfort and prosperity appears to be the dominant passion of the people.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, still, in my opinion, under all forms of\r\ngovernment, it will be a wise part to honor the military profession, in\r\norder to encourage the love of glory and all the warlike virtues, under\r\nthe penalty of receiving the reproaches of posterity and suffering\r\ninsult and dependency.\r\n\r\nIt is not sufficient to foster the military spirit among the people,\r\nbut, more than that, it is necessary to encourage it in the army. Of\r\nwhat avail would it be if the uniform be honored in the land and it be\r\nregarded as a duty to serve in the army, while the military virtues are\r\nwanting? The forces would be numerous but without valor.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm of an army and its military spirit are two quite\r\ndifferent things, and should not be confounded, although they produce\r\nthe same effects. The first is the effect of passions more or less of a\r\ntemporary character,--of a political or religious nature, for instance,\r\nor of a great love of country; while the latter, depending upon the\r\nskill of the commander and resulting from military institutions, is\r\nmore permanent and depends less upon circumstances, and should be the\r\nobject of the attention of every far-seeing government.[6] Courage\r\nshould be recompensed and honored, the different grades in rank\r\nrespected, and discipline should exist in the sentiments and convictions\r\nrather than in external forms only.\r\n\r\nThe officers should feel the conviction that resignation, bravery, and\r\nfaithful attention to duty are virtues without which no glory is\r\npossible, no army is respectable, and that firmness amid reverses is\r\nmore honorable than enthusiasm in success,--since courage alone is\r\nnecessary to storm a position, while it requires heroism to make a\r\ndifficult retreat before a victorious and enterprising enemy, always\r\nopposing to him a firm and unbroken front. A fine retreat should meet\r\nwith a reward equal to that given for a great victory.\r\n\r\nBy inuring armies to labor and fatigue, by keeping them from stagnation\r\nin garrison in times of peace, by inculcating their superiority over\r\ntheir enemies, without depreciating too much the latter, by inspiring a\r\nlove for great exploits,--in a word, by exciting their enthusiasm by\r\nevery means in harmony with their tone of mind, by honoring courage,\r\npunishing weakness, and disgracing cowardice,--we may expect to maintain\r\na high military spirit.\r\n\r\nEffeminacy was the chief cause of the ruin of the Roman legions: those\r\nformidable soldiers, who had borne the casque, buckler, and cuirass in\r\nthe times of the Scipios under the burning sun of Africa, found them too\r\nheavy in the cool climates of Germany and Gaul; and then the empire was\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nI have remarked that it is not well to create a too great contempt for\r\nthe enemy, lest the _morale_ of the soldier should be shaken if he\r\nencounter an obstinate resistance. Napoleon at Jena, addressing Lannes'\r\ntroops, praised the Prussian cavalry, but promised that they would\r\ncontend in vain against the bayonets of his Egyptians.\r\n\r\nThe officers and troops must be warned against those sudden panics\r\nwhich often seize the bravest armies when they are not well controlled\r\nby discipline, and hence when they do not recognize that in order is the\r\nsurest hope of safety. It was not from want of courage that one hundred\r\nthousand Turks were beaten at Peterwardein by Prince Eugene, and at\r\nKagoul by Romanzoff: it was because, once repulsed in their disorderly\r\ncharges, every one yielded to his personal feelings, and because they\r\nfought individually, but not in masses and in order. An army seized with\r\npanic is similarly in a state of demoralization; because when disorder\r\nis once introduced all concerted action on the part of individuals\r\nbecomes impossible, the voice of the officers can no longer be heard, no\r\nmaneuver for resuming the battle can be executed, and there is no\r\nresource but in ignominious flight.\r\n\r\nNations with powerful imaginations are particularly liable to panics;\r\nand nothing short of strong institutions and skillful leaders can remedy\r\nit. Even the French, whose military virtues when well led have never\r\nbeen questioned, have often performed some quick movements of this kind\r\nwhich were highly ridiculous. We may refer to the unbecoming panic which\r\npervaded the infantry of Marshal Villars after having gained the battle\r\nof Friedlingen, in 1704. The same occurred to Napoleon's infantry after\r\nthe victory of Wagram and when the enemy was in full retreat. A still\r\nmore extraordinary case was the flight of the 97th semi-brigade, fifteen\r\nhundred strong, at the siege of Genoa, before a platoon of cavalry. Two\r\ndays afterward these same men took Fort Diamond by one of the most\r\nvigorous assaults mentioned in modern history.\r\n\r\nStill, it would seem to be easy to convince brave men that death comes\r\nmore quickly and more surely to those who fly in disorder than to those\r\nwho remain together and present a firm front to the enemy, or who rally\r\npromptly when their lines have been for the instant broken.\r\n\r\nIn this respect the Russian army may be taken as a model by all others.\r\nThe firmness which it has displayed in all retreats is due in equal\r\ndegrees to the national character, the natural instincts of the\r\nsoldiers, and the excellent disciplinary institutions. Indeed, vivacity\r\nof imagination is not always the cause of the introduction of disorder:\r\nthe want of the habit of order often causes it, and the lack of\r\nprecautions on the part of the generals to maintain this order\r\ncontributes to it. I have often been astonished at the indifference of\r\nmost generals on this point. Not only did they not deign to take the\r\nslightest precaution to give the proper direction to small detachments\r\nor scattered men, and fail to adopt any signals to facilitate the\r\nrallying in each division of the fractions which may be scattered in a\r\nmomentary panic or in an irresistible charge of the enemy, but they were\r\noffended that any one should think of proposing such precautions. Still,\r\nthe most undoubted courage and the most severe discipline will often be\r\npowerless to remedy a great disorder, which might be in a great degree\r\nobviated by the use of rallying-signals for the different divisions.\r\nThere are, it is true, cases where all human resources are insufficient\r\nfor the maintenance of order, as when the physical sufferings of the\r\nsoldiers have been so great as to render them deaf to all appeals, and\r\nwhen their officers find it impossible to do any thing to organize\r\nthem,--which was the case in the retreat of 1812. Leaving out these\r\nexceptional cases, good habits of order, good logistical precautions for\r\nrallying, and good discipline will most frequently be successful, if not\r\nin preventing disorder, at least in promptly remedying it.\r\n\r\nIt is now time to leave this branch, of which I have only desired to\r\ntrace an outline, and to proceed to the examination of subjects which\r\nare purely military.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: For instance, in France, instead of excluding all officers\r\nfrom the privilege of the elective franchise, it should be given to all\r\ncolonels; and the generals should be eligible to the legislature. The\r\nmost venal deputies will not be those from military life.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: It is particularly important that this spirit should\r\npervade the officers and non-commissioned officers: if they be capable,\r\nand the nation brave, there need be no fear for the men.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSTRATEGY.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF STRATEGY AND THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe art of war, independently of its political and moral relations,\r\nconsists of five principal parts, viz.: Strategy, Grand Tactics,\r\nLogistics, Tactics of the different arms, and the Art of the Engineer.\r\nWe will treat of the first three branches, and begin by defining them.\r\nIn order to do this, we will follow the order of procedure of a general\r\nwhen war is first declared, who commences with the points of the highest\r\nimportance, as a plan of campaign, and afterward descends to the\r\nnecessary details. Tactics, on the contrary, begins with details, and\r\nascends to combinations and generalization necessary for the formation\r\nand handling of a great army.\r\n\r\nWe will suppose an army taking the field: the first care of its\r\ncommander should be to agree with the head of the state upon the\r\ncharacter of the war: then he must carefully study the theater of war,\r\nand select the most suitable base of operations, taking into\r\nconsideration the frontiers of the state and those of its allies.\r\n\r\nThe selection of this base and the proposed aim will determine the zone\r\nof operations. The general will take a first objective point: he will\r\nselect the line of operations leading to this point, either as a\r\ntemporary or permanent line, giving it the most advantageous direction;\r\nnamely, that which promises the greatest number of favorable\r\nopportunities with the least danger. An army marching on this line of\r\noperations will have a front of operations and a strategic front. The\r\ntemporary positions which the corps d'armée will occupy upon this front\r\nof operations, or upon the line of defense, will be strategic positions.\r\n\r\nWhen near its first objective point, and when it begins to meet\r\nresistance, the army will either attack the enemy or maneuver to compel\r\nhim to retreat; and for this end it will adopt one or two strategic\r\nlines of maneuvers, which, being temporary, may deviate to a certain\r\ndegree from the general line of operations, with which they must not be\r\nconfounded.\r\n\r\nTo connect the strategic front with the base as the advance is made,\r\nlines of supply, depots, &c. will be established.\r\n\r\nIf the line of operations be long, and there be hostile troops in\r\nannoying proximity to it, these bodies may either be attacked and\r\ndispersed or be merely observed, or the operations against the enemy may\r\nbe carried on without reference to them. If the second of these courses\r\nbe pursued, a double strategic front and large detachments will be the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nThe army being almost within reach of the first objective point, if the\r\nenemy oppose him there will be a battle; if indecisive, the fight will\r\nbe resumed; if the army gains the victory, it will secure its objective\r\npoint or will advance to attain a second. Should the first objective\r\npoint be the possession of an important fort, the siege will be\r\ncommenced. If the army be not strong enough to continue its march, after\r\ndetaching a sufficient force to maintain the siege, it will take a\r\nstrategic position to cover it, as did the army of Italy in 1796, which,\r\nless than fifty thousand strong, could not pass Mantua to enter Austria,\r\nleaving twenty-five thousand enemies within its walls, and having forty\r\nthousand more in front on the double line of the Tyrol and Frioul.\r\n\r\nIf the army be strong enough to make the best use of its victory, or if\r\nit have no siege to make, it will operate toward a second and more\r\nimportant objective point.\r\n\r\nIf this point be distant, it will be necessary to establish an\r\nintermediate point of support. One or more secure cities already\r\noccupied will form an eventual base: when this cannot be done, a small\r\nstrategic reserve may be established, which will protect the rear and\r\nalso the depots by temporary fortifications. When the army crosses large\r\nstreams, it will construct _têtes de pont_; and, if the bridges are\r\nwithin walled cities, earth-works will be thrown up to increase the\r\nmeans of defense and to secure the safety of the eventual base or the\r\nstrategic reserve which may occupy these posts.\r\n\r\nShould the battle be lost, the army will retreat toward its base, in\r\norder to be reinforced therefrom by detachments of troops, or, what is\r\nequivalent, to strengthen itself by the occupation of fortified posts\r\nand camps, thus compelling the enemy to halt or to divide his forces.\r\n\r\nWhen winter approaches, the armies will either go into quarters, or the\r\nfield will be kept by the army which has obtained decisive success and\r\nis desirous of profiting to the utmost by its superiority. These winter\r\ncampaigns are very trying to both armies, but in other respects do not\r\ndiffer from ordinary campaigns, unless it be in demanding increased\r\nactivity and energy to attain prompt success.\r\n\r\nSuch is the ordinary course of a war, and as such we will consider it,\r\nwhile discussing combinations which result from these operations.\r\n\r\nStrategy embraces the following points, viz.:--\r\n\r\n1. The selection of the theater of war, and the discussion of the\r\ndifferent combinations of which it admits.\r\n\r\n2. The determination of the decisive points in these combinations, and\r\nthe most favorable direction for operations.\r\n\r\n3. The selection and establishment of the fixed base and of the zone of\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n4. The selection of the objective point, whether offensive or defensive.\r\n\r\n5. The strategic fronts, lines of defense, and fronts of operations.\r\n\r\n6. The choice of lines of operations leading to the objective point or\r\nstrategic front.\r\n\r\n7. For a given operation, the best strategic line, and the different\r\nmaneuvers necessary to embrace all possible cases.\r\n\r\n8. The eventual bases of operations and the strategic reserves.\r\n\r\n9. The marches of armies, considered as maneuvers.\r\n\r\n10. The relation between the position of depots and the marches of the\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n11. Fortresses regarded as strategical means, as a refuge for an army,\r\nas an obstacle to its progress: the sieges to be made and to be covered.\r\n\r\n12. Points for intrenched camps, _tétes de pont,_ &c.\r\n\r\n13. The diversions to be made, and the large detachments necessary.\r\n\r\nThese points are principally of importance in the determination of the\r\nfirst steps of a campaign; but there are other operations of a mixed\r\nnature, such as passages of streams, retreats, surprises,\r\ndisembarkations, convoys, winter quarters, the execution of which\r\nbelongs to tactics, the conception and arrangement to strategy.\r\n\r\nThe maneuvering of an army upon the battle-field, and the different\r\nformations of troops for attack, constitute Grand Tactics. Logistics is\r\nthe art of moving armies. It comprises the order and details of marches\r\nand camps, and of quartering and supplying troops; in a word, it is the\r\nexecution of strategical and tactical enterprises.\r\n\r\nTo repeat. Strategy is the art of making war upon the map, and\r\ncomprehends the whole theater of operations. Grand Tactics is the art of\r\nposting troops upon the battle-field according to the accidents of the\r\nground, of bringing them into action, and the art of fighting upon the\r\nground, in contradistinction to planning upon a map. Its operations may\r\nextend over a field of ten or twelve miles in extent. Logistics\r\ncomprises the means and arrangements which work out the plans of\r\nstrategy and tactics. Strategy decides where to act; logistics brings\r\nthe troops to this point; grand tactics decides the manner of execution\r\nand the employment of the troops.\r\n\r\nIt is true that many battles have been decided by strategic movements,\r\nand have been, indeed, but a succession of them; but this only occurs in\r\nthe exceptional case of a dispersed army: for the general case of\r\npitched battles the above definition holds good.\r\n\r\nGrand Tactics, in addition to acts of local execution, relates to the\r\nfollowing objects:--\r\n\r\n1. The choice of positions and defensive lines of battle.\r\n\r\n2. The offensive in a defensive battle.\r\n\r\n3. The different orders of battle, or the grand maneuvers proper for the\r\nattack of the enemy's line.\r\n\r\n4. The collision of two armies on the march, or unexpected battles.\r\n\r\n5. Surprises of armies in the open field.\r\n\r\n6. The arrangements for leading troops into battle.\r\n\r\n7. The attack of positions and intrenched camps.\r\n\r\n8. _Coups de main_.\r\n\r\nAll other operations, such as relate to convoys, foraging-parties,\r\nskirmishes of advanced or rear guards, the attack of small posts, and\r\nany thing accomplished by a detachment or single division, may be\r\nregarded as details of war, and not included in the great operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF WAR.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to show that there is one great principle underlying all\r\nthe operations of war,--a principle which must be followed in all good\r\ncombinations. It is embraced in the following maxims:--\r\n\r\n1. To throw by strategic movements the mass of an army, successively,\r\nupon the decisive points of a theater of war, and also upon the\r\ncommunications of the enemy as much as possible without compromising\r\none's own.\r\n\r\n2. To maneuver to engage fractions of the hostile army with the bulk of\r\none's forces.\r\n\r\n3. On the battle-field, to throw the mass of the forces upon the\r\ndecisive point, or upon that portion of the hostile line which it is of\r\nthe first importance to overthrow.\r\n\r\n4. To so arrange that these masses shall not only be thrown upon the\r\ndecisive point, but that they shall engage at the proper times and with\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nThis principle has too much simplicity to escape criticism: one\r\nobjection is that it is easy to recommend throwing the mass of the\r\nforces upon the decisive points, but that the difficulty lies in\r\nrecognizing those points.\r\n\r\nThis truth is evident; and it would be little short of the ridiculous to\r\nenunciate such a general principle without accompanying it with all\r\nnecessary explanations for its application upon the field. In Article\r\nXIX. these decisive points will be described, and in Articles from\r\nXVIII. to XXII. will be discussed their relations to the different\r\ncombinations. Those students who, having attentively considered what is\r\nthere stated, still regard the determination of these points as a\r\nproblem without a solution, may well despair of ever comprehending\r\nstrategy.\r\n\r\nThe general theater of operations seldom contains more than three\r\nzones,--the right, the left, and the center; and each zone, front of\r\noperations, strategic position, and line of defense, as well as each\r\nline of battle, has the same subdivisions,--two extremities and the\r\ncenter. A direction upon one of these three will always be suitable for\r\nthe attainment of the desired end. A direction upon one of the two\r\nremaining will be less advantageous; while the third direction will be\r\nwholly inapplicable. In considering the object proposed in connection\r\nwith the positions of the enemy and the geography of the country, it\r\nwill appear that in every strategic movement or tactical maneuver the\r\nquestion for decision will always be, whether to maneuver to the right,\r\nto the left, or directly in front. The selection of one of these three\r\nsimple alternatives cannot, surely, be considered an enigma. The art of\r\ngiving the proper direction to the masses is certainly the basis of\r\nstrategy, although it is not the whole of the art of war. Executive\r\ntalent, skill, energy, and a quick apprehension of events are necessary\r\nto carry out any combinations previously arranged.\r\n\r\nWe will apply this great principle to the different cases of strategy\r\nand tactics, and then show, by the history of twenty celebrated\r\ncampaigns, that, with few exceptions, the most brilliant successes and\r\nthe greatest reverses resulted from an adherence to this principle in\r\nthe one case, and from a neglect of it in the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF STRATEGIC COMBINATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XVI.\r\n\r\nOf the System of Operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nWar once determined upon, the first point to be decided is, whether it\r\nshall be offensive or defensive; and we will first explain what is meant\r\nby these terms. There are several phases of the offensive: if against a\r\ngreat state, the whole or a large portion of whose territory is\r\nattacked, it is an _invasion_; if a province only, or a line of defense\r\nof moderate extent, be assailed, it is the ordinary offensive; finally,\r\nif the offensive is but an attack upon the enemy's position, and is\r\nconfined to a single operation, it is called the taking the\r\n_initiative_. In a moral and political view, the offensive is nearly\r\nalways advantageous: it carries the war upon foreign soil, saves the\r\nassailant's country from devastation, increases his resources and\r\ndiminishes those of his enemy, elevates the _morale_ of his army, and\r\ngenerally depresses the adversary. It sometimes happens that invasion\r\nexcites the ardor and energy of the adversary,--particularly when he\r\nfeels that the independence of his country is threatened.\r\n\r\nIn a military point of view, the offensive has its good and its bad\r\nside. Strategically, an invasion leads to deep lines of operations,\r\nwhich are always dangerous in a hostile country. All the obstacles in\r\nthe enemy's country, the mountains, rivers, defiles, and forts, are\r\nfavorable for defense, while the inhabitants and authorities of the\r\ncountry, so far from being the instruments of the invading army, are\r\ngenerally hostile. However, if success be obtained, the enemy is struck\r\nin a vital point: he is deprived of his resources and compelled to seek\r\na speedy termination of the contest.\r\n\r\nFor a single operation, which we have called the taking the\r\n_initiative_, the offensive is almost always advantageous, particularly\r\nin strategy. Indeed, if the art of war consists in throwing the masses\r\nupon the decisive points, to do this it will be necessary to take the\r\ninitiative. The attacking party knows what he is doing and what he\r\ndesires to do; he leads his masses to the point where he desires to\r\nstrike. He who awaits the attack is everywhere anticipated: the enemy\r\nfall with large force upon fractions of his force: he neither knows\r\nwhere his adversary proposes to attack him nor in what manner to repel\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nTactically, the offensive also possesses advantages, but they are less\r\npositive, since, the operations being upon a limited field, the party\r\ntaking the initiative cannot conceal them from the enemy, who may detect\r\nhis designs and by the aid of good reserves cause them to fail.\r\n\r\nThe attacking party labors under the disadvantages arising from the\r\nobstacles to be crossed before reaching the enemy's line; on which\r\naccount the advantages and disadvantages of the tactical offensive are\r\nabout equally balanced.\r\n\r\nWhatever advantages may be expected either politically or strategically\r\nfrom the offensive, it may not be possible to maintain it exclusively\r\nthroughout the war; for a campaign offensive in the beginning may become\r\ndefensive before it ends.\r\n\r\nA defensive war is not without its advantages, when wisely conducted. It\r\nmay be passive or active, taking the offensive at times. The passive\r\ndefense is always pernicious; the active may accomplish great successes.\r\nThe object of a defensive war being to protect, as long as possible, the\r\ncountry threatened by the enemy, all operations should be designed to\r\nretard his progress, to annoy him in his enterprises by multiplying\r\nobstacles and difficulties, without, however, compromising one's own\r\narmy. He who invades does so by reason of some superiority; he will then\r\nseek to make the issue as promptly as possible: the defense, on the\r\ncontrary, desires delay till his adversary is weakened by sending off\r\ndetachments, by marches, and by the privations and fatigues incident to\r\nhis progress.\r\n\r\nAn army is reduced to the defensive only by reverses or by a positive\r\ninferiority. It then seeks in the support of forts, and in natural or\r\nartificial barriers, the means of restoring equality by multiplying\r\nobstacles in the way of the enemy. This plan, when not carried to an\r\nextreme, promises many chances of success, but only when the general has\r\nthe good sense not to make the defense passive: he must not remain in\r\nhis positions to receive whatever blows may be given by his adversary;\r\nhe must, on the contrary, redouble his activity, and be constantly upon\r\nthe alert to improve all opportunities of assailing the weak points of\r\nthe enemy. This plan of war may be called the defensive-offensive, and\r\nmay have strategical as well as tactical advantages.. It combines the\r\nadvantages of both systems; for one who awaits his adversary upon a\r\nprepared field, with all his own resources in hand, surrounded by all\r\nthe advantages of being on his own ground, can with hope of success take\r\nthe initiative, and is fully able to judge when and where to strike.\r\n\r\nDuring the first three campaigns of the Seven Years' War Frederick was\r\nthe assailant; in the remaining four his conduct was a perfect model of\r\nthe defensive-offensive. He was, however, wonderfully aided in this by\r\nhis adversaries, who allowed him all the time he desired, and many\r\nopportunities of taking the offensive with success. Wellington's course\r\nwas mainly the same in Portugal, Spain, and Belgium, and it was the most\r\nsuitable in his circumstances. It seems plain that one of the greatest\r\ntalents of a general is to know how to use (it may be alternately) these\r\ntwo systems, and particularly to be able to take the initiative during\r\nthe progress of a defensive war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XVII.\r\n\r\nOf the Theater of Operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theater of a war comprises all the territory upon which the parties\r\nmay assail each other, whether it belong to themselves, their allies, or\r\nto weaker states who may be drawn into the war through fear or interest.\r\nWhen the war is also maritime, the theater may embrace both\r\nhemispheres,--as has happened in contests between France and England\r\nsince the time of Louis XIV. The theater of a war may thus be undefined,\r\nand must, not be confounded with the theater of operations of one or the\r\nother army. The theater of a continental war between France and Austria\r\nmay be confined to Italy, or may, in addition, comprise Germany if the\r\nGerman States take part therein.\r\n\r\nArmies may act in concert or separately: in the first case the whole\r\ntheater of operations may be considered as a single field upon which\r\nstrategy directs the armies for the attainment of a definite end. In the\r\nsecond case each army will have its own independent theater of\r\noperations. The _theater of operations_ of an army embraces all the\r\nterritory it may desire to invade and all that it may be necessary to\r\ndefend. If the army operates independently, it should not attempt any\r\nmaneuver beyond its own theater, (though it should leave it if it be in\r\ndanger of being surrounded,) since the supposition is that no concert of\r\naction has been arranged with the armies operating on the other fields.\r\nIf, on the contrary, there be concert of action, the theater of\r\noperations of each army taken singly is but a zone of operations of the\r\ngeneral field, occupied by the masses for the attainment of a common\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nIndependently of its topographical features, each theater upon which one\r\nor more armies operate is composed, for both parties, as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. Of a fixed base of operations.\r\n\r\n2. Of a principal objective point.\r\n\r\n3. Of fronts of operations, strategic fronts, and lines of defense.\r\n\r\n4. Of zones and lines of operations.\r\n\r\n5. Of temporary strategic lines and lines of communications.\r\n\r\n6. Of natural or artificial obstacles to be overcome or to oppose to the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n7. Of geographical strategic points, whose occupation is important,\r\neither for the offensive or defensive.\r\n\r\n8. Of accidental intermediate bases of operations between the objective\r\npoint and the primary base.\r\n\r\n9. Of points of refuge in case of reverse.\r\n\r\nFor illustration, let us suppose the case of France invading Austria\r\nwith two or three armies, to be concentrated under one commander, and\r\nstarting from Mayence, from the Upper Rhine, from Savoy or the Maritime\r\nAlps, respectively. The section of country which each of these armies\r\ntraverses may be considered as a zone of the general field of\r\noperations. But if the army of Italy goes but to the Adige without\r\nconcerted action with the army of the Rhine, then what was before but a\r\nzone becomes for that army a theater of operations.\r\n\r\nIn every case, each theater must have its own base, its own objective\r\npoint, its zones and lines of operations connecting the objective point\r\nwith the base, either in the offensive or the defensive.\r\n\r\nIt has been taught and published that rivers are lines of operations\r\n_par excellence._ Now, as such a line must possess two or three roads to\r\nmove the army within the range of its operations, and at least one line\r\nof retreat, rivers have been called lines of retreat, and even lines of\r\nmaneuver. It would be much more accurate to say that rivers are\r\nexcellent lines of supply, and powerful auxiliaries in the establishment\r\nof a good line of operations, but never the line itself.\r\n\r\nIt has also been maintained that, could one create a country expressly\r\nto be a good theater of war, converging roads would be avoided, because\r\nthey facilitate invasion. Every country has its capital, its rich cities\r\nfor manufactures or trade; and, in the very nature of things, these\r\npoints must be the centers of converging routes. Could Germany be made a\r\ndesert, to be molded into a theater of war at the pleasure of an\r\nindividual, commercial cities and centers of trade would spring up, and\r\nthe roads would again necessarily converge to these points. Moreover,\r\nwas not the Archduke Charles enabled to beat Jourdan in 1796 by the use\r\nof converging routes? Besides, these routes are more favorable for\r\ndefense than attack, since two divisions retreating upon these radial\r\nlines can effect a junction more quickly than two armies which are\r\npursuing, and they may thus united defeat each of the pursuing masses\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nSome authors have affirmed that mountainous countries abound in\r\nstrategic positions; others have maintained that, on the contrary,\r\nthese points are more rare among the Alps than in the plains, but also\r\nthat if more rare they are more important and more decisive.\r\n\r\nSome authors have represented that high ranges of mountains are, in war,\r\ninaccessible barriers. Napoleon, on the contrary, in speaking of the\r\nRhetian Alps, said that \"an army could pass wherever a man could put his\r\nfoot.\"\r\n\r\nGenerals no less experienced than himself in mountain-warfare have\r\nunited with him in this opinion, in admitting the great difficulty of\r\ncarrying on a defensive war in such localities unless the advantages of\r\npartisan and regular warfare can be combined, the first to guard the\r\nheights and to harass the enemy, the second to give battle at the\r\ndecisive points,--the junctions of the large valleys.\r\n\r\nThese differences of opinion are here noticed merely to show the reader\r\nthat, so far from the art having reached perfection, there are many\r\npoints that admit of discussion.\r\n\r\nThe most important topographical or artificial features which make up\r\nthe theater of a war will, in succeeding portions of this chapter, be\r\nexamined as to their strategic value; but here it may be proper to\r\nremark that this value will depend much upon the spirit and skill of the\r\ngeneral. The great leader who crossed the Saint-Bernard and ordered the\r\npassage of the Splugen was far from believing in the impregnability of\r\nthese chains; but he was also far from thinking that a muddy rivulet and\r\na walled inclosure could change his destiny at Waterloo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XVIII.\r\n\r\nBases of Operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nA base of operations is the portion of country from which the army\r\nobtains its reinforcements and resources, from which it starts when it\r\ntakes the offensive, to which it retreats when necessary, and by which\r\nit is supported when it takes position to cover the country defensively.\r\n\r\nThe base of operations is most generally that of supply,--though not\r\nnecessarily so, at least as far as food is concerned; as, for instance,\r\na French army upon the Elbe might be subsisted from Westphalia or\r\nFranconia, but its real base would certainly be upon the Rhine.\r\n\r\nWhen a frontier possesses good natural or artificial barriers, it may be\r\nalternately either an excellent base for offensive operations, or a line\r\nof defense when the state is invaded. In the latter case it will always\r\nbe prudent to have a second base in rear; for, although an army in its\r\nown country will everywhere find a point of support, there is still a\r\nvast difference between those parts of the country without military\r\npositions and means, as forts, arsenals, and fortified depots, and those\r\nother portions where these military resources are found; and these\r\nlatter alone can be considered as safe bases of operations. An army may\r\nhave in succession a number of bases: for instance, a French army in\r\nGermany will have the Rhine for its first base; it may have others\r\nbeyond this, wherever it has allies or permanent lines of defense; but\r\nif it is driven back across the Rhine it will have for a base either the\r\nMeuse or the Moselle: it might have a third upon the Seine, and a fourth\r\nupon the Loire.\r\n\r\nThese successive bases may not be entirely or nearly parallel to the\r\nfirst. On the contrary, a total change of direction may become\r\nnecessary. A French army repulsed beyond the Rhine might find a good\r\nbase on Béfort or Besançon, on Mézières or Sedan, as the Russian army\r\nafter the evacuation of Moscow left the base on the north and east and\r\nestablished itself upon the line of the Oka and the southern provinces.\r\nThese lateral bases perpendicular to the front of defense are often\r\ndecisive in preventing the enemy from penetrating to the heart of the\r\ncountry, or at least in rendering it impossible for him to maintain\r\nhimself there. A base upon a broad and rapid river, both banks being\r\nheld by strong works, would be as favorable as could be desired.\r\n\r\nThe more extended the base, the more difficulty will there be in\r\ncovering it; but it will also be more difficult to cut the army off from\r\nit. A state whose capital is too near the frontier cannot have so\r\nfavorable a base in a defensive war as one whose capital is more\r\nretired.\r\n\r\nA base, to be perfect, should have two or three fortified points of\r\nsufficient capacity for the establishment of depots of supply. There\r\nshould be a _tête de pont_ upon each of its unfordable streams.\r\n\r\nAll are now agreed upon these principles; but upon other points opinions\r\nhave varied. Some have asserted that a perfect base is one parallel to\r\nthat of the enemy. My opinion is that bases perpendicular to those of\r\nthe enemy are more advantageous, particularly such as have two sides\r\nalmost perpendicular to each other and forming a re-entrant angle, thus\r\naffording a double base if required, and which, by giving the control of\r\ntwo sides of the strategic field, assure two lines of retreat widely\r\napart, and facilitate any change of the line of operations which an\r\nunforeseen turn of affairs may necessitate.\r\n\r\nThe quotations which follow are from my treatise on Great Military\r\nOperations:--\r\n\r\n     \"The general configuration of the theater of war may also have a\r\n     great influence upon the direction of the lines of operations, and,\r\n     consequently, upon the direction of the bases.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n     \"If every theater of war forms a figure presenting four faces more\r\n     or less regular, one of the armies, at the opening of the campaign,\r\n     may hold one of these faces,--perhaps two,--while the enemy\r\n     occupies the other, the fourth being closed by insurmountable\r\n     obstacles. The different ways of occupying this theater will lead\r\n     to widely different combinations. To illustrate, we will cite the\r\n     theater of the French armies in Westphalia from 1757 to 1762, and\r\n     that of Napoleon in 1806, both of which are represented in Fig. 1,\r\n     p. 79. In the first case, the side A B was the North Sea, B D the\r\n     line of the Weser and the base of Duke Ferdinand, C D the line of\r\n     the Main and the base of the French army, A C the line of the\r\n     Rhine, also guarded by French troops. The French held two faces,\r\n     the North Sea being the third; and hence it was only necessary for\r\n     them, by maneuvers, to gain the side B D to be masters of the four\r\n     faces, including the base and the communications of the enemy. The\r\n     French army, starting from its base C D and gaining the front of\r\n     operations F G H, could cut off the allied army I from its base B\r\n     D; the latter would be thrown upon the angle A, formed by the lines\r\n     of the Rhine, the Ems, and the sea, while the army E could\r\n     communicate with its bases on the Main and Rhine.\r\n\r\n     \"The movement of Napoleon in 1806 on the Saale was similar. He\r\n     occupied at Jena and Naumburg the line F G H, then marched by Halle\r\n     and Dessau to force the Prussian army I upon the sea, represented\r\n     by the side A B. The result is well known.\r\n\r\n     \"The art, then, of selecting lines of operations is to give them\r\n     such directions as to seize the communications of the enemy without\r\n     losing one's own. The line F G H, by its extended position, and the\r\n     bend on the flank of the enemy, always protects the communications\r\n     with the base C D; and this is exactly the maneuvers of Marengo,\r\n     Ulm, and Jena.\r\n\r\n     \"When the theater of war does not border upon the sea, it is always\r\n     bounded by a powerful neutral state, which guards its frontiers and\r\n     closes one side of the square. This may not be an obstacle\r\n     insurmountable like the sea; but generally it may be considered as\r\n     an obstacle upon which it would be dangerous to retreat after a\r\n     defeat: hence it would be an advantage to force the enemy upon it.\r\n     The soil of a power which can bring into the field one hundred and\r\n     fifty or two hundred thousand troops cannot be violated with\r\n     impunity; and if a defeated army made the attempt, it would be none\r\n     the less cut off from its base. If the boundary of the theater of\r\n     war should be the territory of a weak state, it would be absorbed\r\n     in this theater, and the square would be enlarged till it reached\r\n     the frontiers of a powerful state, or the sea. The outline of the\r\n     frontiers may modify the shape of the quadrilateral so as to make\r\n     it approach the figure of a parallelogram or trapezoid, as in\r\n     Figure 2. In either case, the advantage of the army which has\r\n     control of two faces of the figure, and possesses the power of\r\n     establishing upon them a double base, will be still more decided,\r\n     since it will be able more easily to cut the enemy off from the\r\n     shortened side,--as was the case with the Prussian army in 1806,\r\n     with the side B D J of the parallelogram formed by the lines of the\r\n     Rhine, the Oder, the North Sea, and the mountainous frontier of\r\n     Franconia.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nThe selection of Bohemia as a base in 1813 goes to prove the truth of my\r\nopinion; for it was the perpendicularity of this base to that of the\r\nFrench army which enabled the allies to neutralize the immense\r\nadvantages which the line of the Elbe would otherwise have afforded\r\nNapoleon, and turned the advantages of the campaign in their favor.\r\nLikewise, in 1812, by establishing their base perpendicularly upon the\r\nOka and Kalouga, the Russians were able to execute their flank march\r\nupon Wiazma and Krasnoi.\r\n\r\nIf any thing further be required to establish these truths, it will only\r\nbe necessary to consider that, if the base be perpendicular to that of\r\nthe enemy, the front of operations will be parallel to his line of\r\noperations, and that hence it will be easy to attack his communications\r\nand line of retreat.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that perpendicular bases are particularly favorable\r\nin the case of a double frontier, as in the last figures. Critics may\r\nobject to this that it does not agree with what is elsewhere said in\r\nfavor of frontiers which are salient toward the enemy, and against\r\ndouble lines of operations with equality of force. (Art. XXI.) The\r\nobjection is not well founded; for the greatest advantage of a\r\nperpendicular base consists in the fact that it forms such a salient,\r\nwhich takes in reverse a portion of the theater of operations. On the\r\nother hand, a base with two faces by no means requires that both should\r\nbe occupied in force: on the contrary, upon one of them it will be\r\nsufficient to have some fortified points garrisoned by small bodies,\r\nwhile the great bulk of the force rests upon the other face,--as was\r\ndone in the campaigns of 1800 and 1806. The angle of nearly ninety\r\ndegrees formed by the portion of the Rhine from Constance to Basel, and\r\nthence to Kehl, gave General Moreau one base parallel and another\r\nperpendicular to that of his antagonist. He threw two divisions by his\r\nleft toward Kehl on the first base, to attract the attention of the\r\nenemy to that point, while he moved with nine divisions upon the\r\nextremity of the perpendicular face toward Schaffhausen, which carried\r\nhim in a few days to the gates of Augsburg, the two detached divisions\r\nhaving already rejoined him.\r\n\r\nIn 1806, Napoleon had also the double base of the Rhine and Main,\r\nforming almost a right re-entrant angle. He left Mortier upon the first\r\nand parallel one, while with the mass of his forces he gained the\r\nextremity of the perpendicular base, and thus intercepted the Prussians\r\nat Gera and Naumburg by reaching their line of retreat.\r\n\r\nIf so many imposing facts prove that bases with two faces, one of them\r\nbeing almost perpendicular to that of the enemy, are the best, it is\r\nwell to recollect that, in default of such a base, its advantages may be\r\npartially supplied by a change of strategic front, as will be seen in\r\nArticle XX.\r\n\r\nAnother very important point in reference to the proper direction of\r\nbases relates to those established on the sea-coast. These bases may be\r\nfavorable in some circumstances, but are equally unfavorable in others,\r\nas may be readily seen from what precedes. The danger which must always\r\nexist of an army being driven to the sea seems so clear, in the ease of\r\nthe establishment of the base upon it, (which bases can only be\r\nfavorable to naval powers,) that it is astonishing to hear in our day\r\npraises of such a base. Wellington, coming with a fleet to the relief of\r\nSpain and Portugal, could not have secured a better base than that of\r\nLisbon, or rather of the peninsula of Torres-Vedras, which covers all\r\nthe avenues to that capital on the land side. The sea and the Tagus not\r\nonly protected both flanks, but secured the safety of his only possible\r\nline of retreat, which was upon the fleet.\r\n\r\nBlinded by the advantages which the intrenched camp of Torres-Vedras\r\nsecured for the English, and not tracing effects to their real causes,\r\nmany generals in other respects wise contend that no bases are good\r\nexcept such as rest on the sea and thus afford the army facilities of\r\nsupply and refuge with both flanks secured. Fascinated by similar\r\nnotions, Colonel Carion-Nizas asserted that in 1813 Napoleon ought to\r\nhave posted half of his army in Bohemia and thrown one hundred and fifty\r\nthousand men on the mouths of the Elbe toward Hamburg; forgetting that\r\nthe first precept for a continental army is to establish its base upon\r\nthe front farthest _from_ the sea, so as to secure the benefit of all\r\nits elements of strength, from which it might find itself cut off if the\r\nbase were established upon the coast.\r\n\r\nAn insular and naval power acting on the continent would pursue a\r\ndiametrically opposite course, but resulting from the same principle,\r\nviz.: _to establish the base upon those points where it can be sustained\r\nby all the resources of the country, and at the same time insure a safe\r\nretreat._\r\n\r\nA state powerful both on land and sea, whose squadrons control the sea\r\nadjacent to the theater of operations, might well base an army of forty\r\nor fifty thousand men upon the coast, as its retreat by sea and its\r\nsupplies could be well assured; but to establish a continental army of\r\none hundred and fifty thousand men upon such a base, when opposed by a\r\ndisciplined and nearly equal force, would be an act of madness.\r\n\r\nHowever, as every maxim has its exceptions, there is a case in which it\r\nmay be admissible to base a continental army upon the sea: it is, when\r\nyour adversary is not formidable upon land, and when you, being master\r\nof the sea, can supply the army with more facility than in the interior.\r\nWe rarely see these conditions fulfilled: it was so, however, during the\r\nTurkish war of 1828 and 1829. The whole attention of the Russians was\r\ngiven to Varna and Bourghas, while Shumla was merely observed; a plan\r\nwhich they could not have pursued in the presence of a European army\r\n(even with the control of the sea) without great danger of ruin.\r\n\r\nDespite all that has been said by triflers who pretend to decide upon\r\nthe fate of empires, this war was, in the main, well conducted. The army\r\ncovered itself by obtaining the fortresses of Brailoff, Varna, and\r\nSilistria, and afterward by preparing a depot at Sizeboli. As soon as\r\nits base was well established it moved upon Adrianople, which previously\r\nwould have been madness. Had the season been a couple of months longer,\r\nor had the army not come so great a distance in 1828, the war would have\r\nterminated with the first campaign.\r\n\r\nBesides permanent bases, which are usually established upon our own\r\nfrontiers, or in the territory of a faithful ally, there are eventual or\r\ntemporary bases, which result from the operations in the enemy's\r\ncountry; but, as these are rather temporary points of support, they\r\nwill, to avoid confusion, be discussed in Article XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XIX.\r\n\r\nStrategic lines and Points, Decisive Points of the Theater of War, and\r\nObjective Points of Operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrategic lines and points are of different kinds. Some receive this\r\ntitle simply from their position, which gives them all their importance:\r\nthese are permanent geographical strategic points. Others have a value\r\nfrom the relations they bear to the positions of the masses of the\r\nhostile troops and to the enterprises likely to be directed against\r\nthem: such are strategic points of maneuver, and are eventual. Finally,\r\nthere are points which have only a secondary importance, and others\r\nwhose importance is constant and immense: the latter are called DECISIVE\r\nstrategic points.\r\n\r\nEvery point of the theater of war which is of military importance,\r\nwhether from its position as a center of communication, or from the\r\npresence of military establishments or fortifications, is a geographical\r\nstrategic point.\r\n\r\nA distinguished general affirms that such a point would not necessarily\r\nbe a strategic point, unless situated favorably for a contemplated\r\noperation. I think differently; for a strategic point is such\r\nessentially and by nature, and, no matter how far distant it may be from\r\nthe scene of the first enterprises, it may be included in the field by\r\nsome unforeseen turn of events, and thus acquire its full importance. It\r\nwould, then, be more accurate to state that all strategic points are not\r\nnecessarily decisive points.\r\n\r\nLines are strategic either from their geographical position or from\r\ntheir relation to temporary maneuvers. The first class may be subdivided\r\nas follows,--viz.: geographic lines which by their permanent importance\r\nbelong to the decisive points[7] of the theater of war, and those which\r\nhave value merely because they connect two strategic points.\r\n\r\nTo prevent confusion, we will elsewhere treat of strategic lines in\r\ntheir relations to maneuvers,--confining ourselves here to what relates\r\nto the _decisive and objective points_ of the zone of operations upon\r\nwhich enterprises occur.\r\n\r\nAlthough these are most intimately connected, since every objective\r\npoint ought necessarily to be one of the decisive points of the theater\r\nof war, there is nevertheless a distinction between them; for all\r\ndecisive points cannot be at the same time the objective of operations.\r\nWe will, then, define the first, in order to be more easily guided in\r\nour selection of the second.\r\n\r\nI think the name of _decisive strategic point_ should be given to all\r\nthose which are capable of exercising a marked influence either upon the\r\nresult of the campaign or upon a single enterprise. All points whose\r\ngeographical position and whose natural or artificial advantages favor\r\nthe attack or defense of a front of operations or of a line of defense\r\nare included in this number; and large, well-located fortresses occupy\r\nin importance the first rank among them.\r\n\r\nThe decisive points of a theater of war are of several kinds. The first\r\nare the geographic points and lines whose importance is permanent and a\r\nconsequence of the configuration of the country. For example, take the\r\ncase of the French in Belgium: whoever is master of the line of the\r\nMeuse will have the greatest advantages in taking possession of the\r\ncountry; for his adversary, being outflanked and inclosed between the\r\nMeuse and the North Sea, will be exposed to the danger of total ruin if\r\nhe give battle parallel to that sea.[8] Similarly, the valley of the\r\nDanube presents a series of important points which have caused it to be\r\nlooked upon as the key of Southern Germany.\r\n\r\nThose points the possession of which would give the control of the\r\njunction of several valleys and of the center of the chief lines of\r\ncommunication in a country are also _decisive geographic points_. For\r\ninstance, Lyons is an important strategic point, because it controls the\r\nvalleys of the Rhone and Saône, and is at the center of communications\r\nbetween France and Italy and between the South and East; but it would\r\nnot be a _decisive_ point unless well fortified or possessing an\r\nextended camp with _têtes de pont_. Leipsic is most certainly a\r\nstrategic point, inasmuch as it is at the junction of all the\r\ncommunications of Northern Germany. Were it fortified and did it occupy\r\nboth banks of the river, it would be almost the key of the country,--if\r\na country has a key, or if this expression means more than a decisive\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nAll capitals are strategic points, for the double reason that they are\r\nnot only centers of communications, but also the seats of power and\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIn mountainous countries there are defiles which are the only routes of\r\nexit practicable for an army; and these may be decisive in reference to\r\nany enterprise in this country. It is well known how great was the\r\nimportance of the defile of Bard, protected by a single small fort, in\r\n1800.\r\n\r\nThe second kind of decisive points are accidental points of maneuver,\r\nwhich result from the positions of the troops on both sides.\r\n\r\nWhen Mack was at Ulm, in 1805, awaiting the approach of the Russian army\r\nthrough Moravia, the decisive point in an attack upon him was Donauwerth\r\nor the Lower Lech; for if his adversaries gained it before him he was\r\ncut off from his line of retreat, and also from the army intended to\r\nsupport him. On the contrary, Kray, who, in 1800, was in the same\r\nposition, expected no aid from Bohemia, but rather from the Tyrol and\r\nfrom the army of Mélas in Italy: hence the decisive point of attack upon\r\nhim was not Donauwerth, but on the opposite side, by Schaffhausen, since\r\nthis would take in reverse his front of operations, expose his line of\r\nretreat, cut him off from his supporting army as well as from his base,\r\nand force him upon the Main. In the same campaign the first objective\r\npoint of Napoleon was to fall upon the right of Mélas by the\r\nSaint-Bernard, and to seize his line of communications: hence\r\nSaint-Bernard, Ivrea, and Piacenza were decisive points only by reason\r\nof the march of Mélas upon Nice.\r\n\r\nIt may be laid down as a general principle that the decisive points of\r\nmaneuver are on that flank of the enemy upon which, if his opponent\r\noperates, he can more easily cut him off from his base and supporting\r\nforces without being exposed to the same danger. The flank opposite to\r\nthe sea is always to be preferred, because it gives an opportunity of\r\nforcing the enemy upon the sea. The only exception to this is in the\r\ncase of an insular and inferior army, where the attempt, although\r\ndangerous, might be made to cut it off from the fleet.\r\n\r\nIf the enemy's forces are in detachments, or are too much extended, the\r\ndecisive point is his center; for by piercing that, his forces will be\r\nmore divided, their weakness increased, and the fractions may be crushed\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nThe decisive point of a battle-field will be determined by,--\r\n\r\n1. The features of the ground.\r\n\r\n2. The relation of the local features to the ultimate strategic aim.\r\n\r\n3. The positions occupied by the respective forces.\r\n\r\nThese considerations will be discussed in the chapter on battles.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE POINTS.\r\n\r\nThere are two classes of objective points,--objective _points of\r\nmaneuver_, and _geographical objective points_. A geographical objective\r\npoint may be an important fortress, the line of a river, a front of\r\noperations which affords good lines of defense or good points of support\r\nfor ulterior enterprises. _Objective points of maneuver_, in\r\ncontradistinction to _geographical objectives_, derive their importance\r\nfrom, and their positions depend upon, the situation of the hostile\r\nmasses.\r\n\r\nIn strategy, the object of the campaign determines the objective point.\r\nIf this aim be offensive, the point will be the possession of the\r\nhostile capital, or that of a province whose loss would compel the enemy\r\nto make peace. In a war of invasion the capital is, ordinarily, the\r\nobjective point. However, the geographical position of the capital, the\r\npolitical relations of the belligerents with their neighbors, and their\r\nrespective resources, are considerations foreign in themselves to the\r\nart of fighting battles, but intimately connected with plans of\r\noperations, and may decide whether an army should attempt or not to\r\noccupy the hostile capital. If it be concluded not to seize the capital,\r\nthe objective point might be a part of the front of operations or line\r\nof defense where an important fort is situated, the possession of which\r\nwould render safe the occupation of the neighboring territory. For\r\ninstance, if France were to invade Italy in a war against Austria, the\r\nfirst objective point would be the line of the Ticino and Po; the\r\nsecond, Mantua and the line of the Adige. In the defensive, the\r\nobjective point, instead of being that which it is desirable to gain\r\npossession of, is that which is to be defended. The capital, being\r\nconsidered the seat of power, becomes the principal objective point of\r\nthe defense; but there may be other points, as the defense of a first\r\nline and of the first base of operations. Thus, for a French army\r\nreduced to the defensive behind the Rhine, the first objective would be\r\nto prevent the passage of the river; it would endeavor to relieve the\r\nforts in Alsace if the enemy succeeded in effecting a passage of the\r\nriver and in besieging them: the second objective would be to cover the\r\nfirst base of operations upon the Meuse or Moselle,--which might be\r\nattained by a lateral defense as well as one in front.\r\n\r\nAs to the objective points of _maneuvers_,--that is, those which relate\r\nparticularly to the destruction or decomposition of the hostile\r\nforces,--their importance may be seen by what has already been said. The\r\ngreatest talent of a general, and the surest hope of success, lie in\r\nsome degree in the good choice of these points. This was the most\r\nconspicuous merit of Napoleon. Rejecting old systems, which were\r\nsatisfied by the capture of one or two points or with the occupation of\r\nan adjoining province, he was convinced that the best means of\r\naccomplishing great results was to dislodge and destroy the hostile\r\narmy,--since states and provinces fall of themselves when there is no\r\norganized force to protect them. To detect at a glance the relative\r\nadvantages presented by the different zones of operations, to\r\nconcentrate the mass of the forces upon that one which gave the best\r\npromise of success, to be indefatigable in ascertaining the approximate\r\nposition of the enemy, to fall with the rapidity of lightning upon his\r\ncenter if his front was too much extended, or upon that flank by which\r\nhe could more readily seize his communications, to outflank him, to cut\r\nhis line, to pursue him to the last, to disperse and destroy his\r\nforces,--such was the system followed by Napoleon in his first\r\ncampaigns. These campaigns proved this system to be one of the very\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nWhen these maneuvers were applied, in later years, to the long distances\r\nand the inhospitable regions of Russia, they were not so successful as\r\nin Germany: however, it must be remembered that, if this kind of war is\r\nnot suitable to all capacities, regions, or circumstances, its chances\r\nof success are still very great, and it is based upon principle.\r\nNapoleon abused the system; but this does not disprove its real\r\nadvantages when a proper limit is assigned to its enterprises and they\r\nare made in harmony with the respective conditions of the armies and of\r\nthe adjoining states.\r\n\r\nThe maxims to be given on these important strategic operations are\r\nalmost entirely included in what has been said upon decisive points, and\r\nin what will be stated in Article XXI. in discussing the choice of lines\r\nof operations.\r\n\r\nAs to the choice of objective points, every thing will generally depend\r\nupon the aim of the war and the character which political or other\r\ncircumstances may give it, and, finally, upon the military facilities of\r\nthe two parties.\r\n\r\nIn cases where there are powerful reasons for avoiding all risk, it may\r\nbe prudent to aim only at the acquisition of partial advantages,--such\r\nas the capture of a few towns or the possession of adjacent territory.\r\nIn other cases, where a party has the means of achieving a great success\r\nby incurring great dangers, he may attempt the destruction of the\r\nhostile army, as did Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThe maneuvers of Ulm and Jena cannot be recommended to an army whose\r\nonly object is the siege of Antwerp. For very different reasons, they\r\ncould not be recommended to the French army beyond the Niemen, five\r\nhundred leagues from its frontiers, because there would be much more to\r\nbe lost by failure than a general could reasonably hope to gain by\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of decisive points to be mentioned, which are\r\ndetermined more from political than from strategic considerations: they\r\nplay a great part in most coalitions, and influence the operations and\r\nplans of cabinets. They may be called _political objective points_.\r\n\r\nIndeed, besides the intimate connection between statesmanship and war in\r\nits preliminaries, in most campaigns some military enterprises are\r\nundertaken to carry out a political end, sometimes quite important, but\r\noften very irrational. They frequently lead to the commission of great\r\nerrors in strategy. We cite two examples. First, the expedition of the\r\nDuke of York to Dunkirk, suggested by old commercial views, gave to the\r\noperations of the allies a divergent direction, which caused their\r\nfailure: hence this objective point was bad in a military view. The\r\nexpedition of the same prince to Holland in 1799--likewise due to the\r\nviews of the English cabinet, sustained by the intentions of Austria on\r\nBelgium--was not less fatal; for it led to the march of the Archduke\r\nCharles from Zurich upon Manheim,--a step quite contrary to the\r\ninterests of the allied armies at the time it was undertaken. These\r\nillustrations prove that political objective points should be\r\nsubordinate to strategy, at least until after a great success has been\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nThis subject is so extensive and so complicated that it would be absurd\r\nto attempt to reduce it to a few rules. The only one which can be given\r\nhas just been alluded to, and is, that either the political objective\r\npoints should be selected according to the principles of strategy, or\r\ntheir consideration should be postponed till after the decisive events\r\nof the campaign. Applying this rule to the examples just given, it will\r\nbe seen that it was at Cambray or in the heart of France that Dunkirk\r\nshould have been conquered in 1793 and Holland delivered in 1799; in\r\nother words, by uniting all the strength of the allies for great\r\nattempts on the decisive points of the frontiers. Expeditions of this\r\nkind are generally included in grand diversions,--to be treated of in a\r\nseparate article.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: I may be reproached with inaccuracy of expression,--since a\r\nline cannot be a _point_, and yet I apply to lines the name of decisive\r\nor objective points. It seems almost useless to remark that _objective_\r\npoints are not geometric points, but that the name is a form of\r\nexpression used to designate the object which an army desires to\r\nattain.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: This only applies to continental armies, and not to the\r\nEnglish, who, having their base on Antwerp or Ostend, would have nothing\r\nto fear from an occupation of the line of the Meuse.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XX.\r\n\r\nFronts of Operations, Strategic Fronts, Lines of Defense, and Strategic\r\nPositions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some parts of the military science that so closely resemble\r\neach other, and are so intimately allied, that they are frequently\r\nconfounded, although they are decidedly distinct. Such are _fronts of\r\noperations, strategic fronts, lines of defense_, and _strategic\r\npositions_. It is proposed in this article to show the distinction\r\nbetween them and to expose their relations to each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRONTS OF OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIC FRONTS.\r\n\r\nWhen the masses of an army are posted in a zone of operations, they\r\ngenerally occupy strategic positions. The extent of the front occupied\r\ntoward the enemy is called the _strategic front_. The portion of the\r\ntheater of war from which an enemy can probably reach this front in two\r\nor three marches is called the _front of operations_.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance between these two fronts has caused many military men to\r\nconfound them, sometimes under one name and sometimes under the other.\r\n\r\nRigorously speaking, however, the strategic front designates that formed\r\nby the actual positions occupied by the masses of the army, while the\r\nother embraces the space separating the two armies, and extends one or\r\ntwo marches beyond each extremity of the strategic front, and includes\r\nthe ground upon which the armies will probably come in collision.\r\n\r\nWhen the operations of a campaign are on the eve of commencing, one of\r\nthe armies will decide to await the attack of the other, and will\r\nundertake to prepare a line of defense, which may be either that of the\r\nstrategic front or more to the rear. Hence the strategic front and line\r\nof defense may coincide, as was the case in 1795 and 1796 upon the\r\nRhine, which was then a line of defense for both Austrians and French,\r\nand at the same time their strategic front and front of operations. This\r\noccasional coincidence of these lines doubtless leads persons to\r\nconfound them, while they are really very different. An army has not\r\nnecessarily a line of defense, as, for example, when it invades: when\r\nits masses are concentrated in a single position, it has no strategic\r\nfront, but it is never without a front of operations.\r\n\r\nThe two following examples will illustrate the difference between the\r\ndifferent terms.\r\n\r\nAt the resumption of hostilities in 1813, Napoleon's front of operations\r\nextended at first from Hamburg to Wittenberg; thence it ran along the\r\nline of the allies toward Glogau and Breslau, (his right being at\r\nLöwenberg,) and followed along the frontier of Bohemia to Dresden. His\r\nforces were stationed on this grand front in four masses, whose\r\nstrategic positions were interior and central and presented three\r\ndifferent faces. Subsequently, he retired behind the Elbe. His real line\r\nof defense then extended only from Wittenberg to Dresden, with a bend to\r\nthe rear toward Marienberg, for Hamburg and Magdeburg were beyond the\r\nstrategic field, and it would have been fatal for him to have extended\r\nhis operations to these points.\r\n\r\nThe other example is his position about Mantua in 1796. His front of\r\noperations here really extended from the mountains of Bergamo to the\r\nAdriatic Sea, while his real line of defense was upon the Adige, between\r\nLake Garda and Legnago: afterward it was upon the Mincio, between\r\nPeschiera and Mantua, while his strategic front varied according to his\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nThe front of operations being the space which separates the two armies,\r\nand upon which they may fight, is ordinarily parallel to the base of\r\noperations. The strategic front will have the same direction, and ought\r\nto be perpendicular to the principal line of operations, and to extend\r\nfar enough on either flank to cover this line well. However, this\r\ndirection may vary, either on account of projects that are formed, or on\r\naccount of the attacks of the enemy; and it quite frequently happens\r\nthat it is necessary to have a front perpendicular to the base and\r\nparallel to the original line of operations. Such a change of strategic\r\nfront is one of the most important of all grand maneuvers, for by this\r\nmeans the control of two faces of the strategic field may be obtained,\r\nthus giving the army a position almost as favorable as if it possessed a\r\nbase with two faces. (See Art. XVIII.)\r\n\r\nThe strategic front of Napoleon in his march on Eylau illustrates these\r\npoints. His pivots of operations were at Warsaw and Thorn, which made\r\nthe Vistula a temporary base: the front became parallel to the Narew,\r\nfrom whence he set out, supported by Sierock, Pultusk, and Ostrolenka,\r\nto maneuver by his right and throw the Russians on Elbing and the\r\nBaltic. In such cases, if a point of support in the new direction can be\r\nobtained, the strategic front gives the advantages referred to above. It\r\nought to be borne in mind in such maneuvers that the army should always\r\nbe sure of regaining its temporary base if necessary; in other words,\r\nthat this base should be prolonged behind the strategic front, and\r\nshould be covered by it. Napoleon, marching from the Narew by Allenstein\r\nupon Eylau, had behind his left Thorn, and farther from the front of the\r\narmy the _tête de pont_ of Praga and Warsaw; so that his communications\r\nwere safe, while Benningsen, forced to face him and to make his line\r\nparallel to the Baltic, might be cut off from his base, and be thrown\r\nback upon the mouths of the Vistula. Napoleon executed another very\r\nremarkable change of strategic front in his march from Gera upon Jena\r\nand Naumburg in 1806. Moreau made another in moving by his right upon\r\nAugsburg and Dillingen, fronting the Danube and France, and thereby\r\nforcing Kray to evacuate the intrenched camp at Ulm.\r\n\r\nThe change of the strategic front to a position perpendicular to the\r\nbase may be a temporary movement for an operation of a few days'\r\nduration, or it may be for an indefinite time, in order to profit by\r\nimportant advantages afforded by certain localities, to strike decisive\r\nblows, or to procure for the army a good line of defense and good\r\npivots of operations, which would be almost equivalent to a real base.\r\n\r\nIt often happens that an army is compelled to have a double strategic\r\nfront, either by the features of the theater of war, or because every\r\nline of offensive operations requires protection on its flanks. As an\r\nexample of the first, the frontiers of Turkey and Spain may be cited. In\r\norder to cross the Balkan or the Ebro, an army would be obliged to\r\npresent a double front,--in the first case, to face the valley of the\r\nDanube; in the second, to confront forces coming from Saragossa or Leon.\r\n\r\nAll extensive countries necessitate, to a greater or less degree, the\r\nsame precaution. A French army in the valley of the Danube will require\r\na double front as soon as the Austrians have thrown sufficient troops\r\ninto the Tyrol or Bohemia to give rise to any anxiety. Those countries\r\nwhich present a narrow frontier to the enemy are the only exception,\r\nsince the troops left on the frontier to harass the flanks of the enemy\r\ncould themselves be cut off and captured. This necessity of double\r\nstrategic fronts is one of the most serious inconveniences of an\r\noffensive war, since it requires large detachments, which are always\r\ndangerous. (See Article XXXVI.)\r\n\r\nOf course, all that precedes relates to regular warfare. In a national\r\nor intestine war the whole country is the scene of hostilities.\r\nNevertheless, each large fraction of an army having a defined aim would\r\nhave its own strategic front determined by the features of the country\r\nand the positions occupied by the large bodies of the enemy. Thus,\r\nSuchet in Catalonia and Massena in Portugal each had a strategic front,\r\nwhile the front of some other corps of the army was not clearly defined.\r\n\r\n\r\nLINES OF DEFENSE.\r\n\r\nLines of defense are classified as strategical and tactical. Strategical\r\nlines of defense are subdivided into two classes: 1. Permanent lines of\r\ndefense, which are a part of the defensive system of a state, such as\r\nthe line of a fortified frontier; 2. Eventual lines of defense, which\r\nrelate only to the temporary position of an army.\r\n\r\nThe frontier is a permanent line of defense when it presents a\r\nwell-connected system of obstacles, natural and artificial, such as\r\nranges of mountains, broad rivers, and fortresses. Thus, the range of\r\nthe Alps between France and Piedmont is a line of defense, since the\r\npracticable passes are guarded by forts which would prove great\r\nobstacles in the way of an army, and since the outlets of the gorges in\r\nthe valleys of Piedmont are protected by large fortresses. The Rhine,\r\nthe Oder, and the Elbe may also be considered as permanent lines of\r\ndefense, on account of the important forts found upon them.\r\n\r\nEvery river of any considerable width, every range of mountains, and\r\nevery defile, having their weak points covered by temporary\r\nfortifications, may be regarded as _eventual lines of defense_, both\r\nstrategic and tactical, since they may arrest for some time the progress\r\nof the enemy, or may compel him to deviate to the right or left in\r\nsearch of a weaker point,--in which case the advantage is evidently\r\nstrategic. If the enemy attack in front, the lines present an evident\r\ntactical advantage, since it is always more difficult to drive an army\r\nfrom its position behind a river, or from a point naturally and\r\nartificially strong, than to attack it on an open plain. On the other\r\nhand, this advantage must not be considered unqualified, lest we should\r\nfall into the system of positions which has been the ruin of so many\r\narmies; for, whatever may be the facilities of a position for defense,\r\nit is quite certain that the party which remains in it passive and\r\nreceiving all the attacks of his adversary will finally yield.[9] In\r\naddition to this, since a position naturally very strong[10] is\r\ndifficult of access it will be as difficult of egress, the enemy may be\r\nable with an inferior force to confine the army by guarding all the\r\noutlets. This happened to the Saxons in the camp of Pirna, and to\r\nWurmser in Mantua.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRATEGIC POSITIONS.\r\n\r\nThere is a disposition of armies to which the name of strategic position\r\nmay be applied, to distinguish from tactical positions or positions for\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nStrategic positions are those taken for some time and which are intended\r\nto cover a much greater portion of the front of operations than would be\r\ncovered in an actual battle. All positions behind a river or upon a line\r\nof defense, the divisions of the army being separated by considerable\r\ndistances, are of this class, such as those of Napoleon at Rivoli,\r\nVerona, and Legnago to overlook the Adige. His positions in 1813 in\r\nSaxony and Silesia in advance of his line of defense were strategic. The\r\npositions of the Anglo-Prussian armies on the frontier of Belgium before\r\nthe battle of Ligny, (1814,) and that of Massena on the Limmat and Aar\r\nin 1799, were also strategic. Even winter quarters, when compact and in\r\nface of the enemy and not protected by an armistice, are strategic\r\npositions,--for instance, Napoleon on the Passarge in 1807. The daily\r\npositions taken up by an army beyond the reach of the enemy, which are\r\nsometimes spread out either to deceive him or to facilitate movements,\r\nare of this class.\r\n\r\nThis class also includes positions occupied by an army to cover several\r\npoints and positions held by the masses of an army for the purposes of\r\nobservation. The different positions taken up on a line of defense, the\r\npositions of detachments on a double front of operations, the position\r\nof a detachment covering a siege, the main army in the meanwhile\r\noperating on another point, are all strategic. Indeed, all large\r\ndetachments or fractions of an army may be considered as occupying\r\nstrategic positions.\r\n\r\nThe maxims to be given on the preceding points are few, since fronts,\r\nlines of defense, and strategic positions generally depend upon a\r\nmultitude of circumstances giving rise to infinite variety.\r\n\r\nIn every case, the first general rule is that the communications with\r\nthe different points of the line of operations be thoroughly assured.\r\n\r\nIn the defense it is desirable that the strategic fronts and lines of\r\ndefense should present both upon the flanks and front formidable natural\r\nor artificial obstacles to serve as points of support. The points of\r\nsupport on the strategic front are called _pivots of operations_, and\r\nare practical temporary bases, but quite different from pivots of\r\nmaneuver. For example, in 1796 Verona was an excellent pivot of\r\noperations for all Napoleon's enterprises about Mantua for eight months.\r\nIn 1813 Dresden was his pivot.\r\n\r\nPivots of maneuver are detachments of troops left to guard points which\r\nit is essential to hold, while the bulk of the army proceeds to the\r\nfulfillment of some important end; and when this is accomplished the\r\npivot of maneuver ceases to exist. Thus, Ney's corps was the pivot of\r\nNapoleon's maneuver by Donauwerth and Augsburg to cut Mack from his line\r\nof retreat. A pivot of operations, on the contrary, is a material point\r\nof both strategical and tactical importance, serves as a point of\r\nsupport and endures throughout a campaign.\r\n\r\nThe most desirable quality of a line of defense is that it should be as\r\nshort as possible, in order to be covered with facility by the army if\r\nit is compelled to take the defensive. It is also important that the\r\nextent of the strategic front should not be so great as to prevent the\r\nprompt concentration of the fractions of the army upon an advantageous\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nThe same does not altogether apply to the front of operations; for if it\r\nbe too contracted it would be difficult for an army on the offensive to\r\nmake strategic maneuvers calculated to produce great results, since a\r\nshort front could be easily covered by the defensive army. Neither\r\nshould the front of operations be too extended. Such a front is\r\nunsuitable for offensive operations, as it would give the enemy, if not\r\na good line of defense, at least ample space to escape from the results\r\nof a strategic maneuver even if well planned. Thus, the beautiful\r\noperations of Marengo, Ulm, and Jena could not have produced the same\r\nresults upon a theater of the magnitude of that of the Russian War in\r\n1812, since the enemy, even if cut off from his line of retreat, could\r\nhave found another by adopting a new zone of operations.\r\n\r\nThe essential conditions for every strategic position are that it should\r\nbe more compact than the forces opposed, that all fractions of the army\r\nshould have sure and easy means of concentrating, free from the\r\nintervention of the enemy. Thus, for forces nearly equal, all central or\r\ninterior positions would be preferable to exterior ones, since the front\r\nin the latter case would necessarily be more extended and would lead to\r\na dangerous division of force. Great mobility and activity on the part\r\nof the troops occupying these positions will be a strong element of\r\nsecurity or of superiority over the enemy, since it renders possible\r\nrapid concentration at different and successive points of the front.\r\n\r\nAn army should never long occupy any strategic point without making\r\nselection of one or two tactical positions, for the purpose of there\r\nconcentrating all the disposable force, and giving battle to the enemy\r\nwhen he shall have unveiled his designs. In this manner Napoleon\r\nprepared the fields of Rivoli and Austerlitz, Wellington that of\r\nWaterloo, and the Archduke Charles that of Wagram.\r\n\r\nWhen an army either camps or goes into quarters, the general should be\r\ncareful that the front be not too extended. A disposition which might be\r\ncalled the strategic square seems best, presenting three nearly-equal\r\nfaces, so that the distance to be passed over would be about equal for\r\nall the divisions in concentrating upon the common center to receive an\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nEvery strategic line of defense should always possess a tactical point\r\nupon which to rally for defense should the enemy cross the strategic\r\nfront. For instance, an army guarding a bank of a river, not being able\r\nto occupy in force the whole line, ought always to have a position in\r\nrear of the center selected, upon which to collect all his divisions, so\r\nas to oppose them united to the enemy when he has succeeded in effecting\r\na passage.\r\n\r\nFor an army entering a country with the purpose either of subjugation\r\nor of temporary occupation, it would always be prudent, however\r\nbrilliant may have been its earlier successes, to prepare a line of\r\ndefense as a refuge in case of reverse. This remark is made to complete\r\nthe subject: the lines themselves are intimately connected with\r\ntemporary bases, and will be discussed in a future article, (XXIII.)\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: This does not refer to intrenched camps, which make a great\r\ndifference. They are treated of in Article XXVII.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: It is a question here of positions of camps, and not of\r\npositions for battle. The latter will be treated of in the chapter\r\ndevoted to Grand Tactics, (Article XXX.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXI.\r\n\r\nZones and Lines of Operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nA zone of operations is a certain fraction of the whole theater of war,\r\nwhich may be traversed by an army in the attainment of its object,\r\nwhether it act singly or in concert with other and secondary armies. For\r\nexample, in the plan of campaign of 1796, Italy was the zone of the\r\nright, Bavaria that of the center, Franconia that of the left army.\r\n\r\nA zone of operations may sometimes present but a single _line of\r\noperations_, either on account of the configuration of the country, or\r\nof the small number of practicable routes for an army found therein.\r\nGenerally, however, a zone presents several _lines of operations_,\r\ndepending partly upon the plans of the campaign, partly upon the number\r\nof great routes of communication existing in the theater of operations.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be understood from this that every road is of itself a\r\n_line of operations_,--though doubtless it may happen that any good road\r\nin a certain turn of affairs may become for the time-being such a line;\r\nbut as long as it is only traversed by detachments, and lies beyond the\r\nsphere of the principal enterprises, it cannot truly be called the real\r\nline of operations. Moreover, the existence of several routes leading to\r\nthe same front of operations, and separated by one or two marches, would\r\nnot constitute so many lines of operations, but, being the\r\ncommunications of the different divisions of the same army, the whole\r\nspace bounded by them would constitute but a single line.\r\n\r\nThe term _zone of operations_ is applied to a large fraction of the\r\ngeneral theater of war; the term _lines of operations_ will designate\r\nthe part of this fraction embraced by the enterprises of the army.\r\nWhether it follow a single or several routes, the term _strategic\r\nlines_ will apply to those important lines which connect the decisive\r\npoints of the theater of operations either with each other or with the\r\nfront of operations; and, for the same reason, we give this name to\r\nthose lines which the army would follow to reach one of these decisive\r\npoints, or to accomplish an important maneuver which requires a\r\ntemporary deviation from the principal line of operations. _Lines of\r\ncommunications_ designate the practicable routes between the different\r\nportions of the army occupying different positions throughout the zone\r\nof operations.\r\n\r\nFor example, in 1813, after the accession of Austria to the Grand\r\nCoalition, three allied armies were to invade Saxony, one Bavaria, and\r\nanother Italy: so that Saxony, or rather the country between Dresden,\r\nMagdeburg, and Breslau, formed the zone of operations of the mass of the\r\nforces. This zone had three _lines of operations_ leading to Leipsic as\r\nan objective: the first was the line of the army of Bohemia, leading\r\nfrom the mountains of Erzgebirge by Dresden and Chemnitz upon Leipsic;\r\nthe second was the line of the army of Silesia, going from Breslau by\r\nDresden or by Wittenberg upon Leipsic; the third was that of Bernadotte\r\nfrom Berlin by Dessau to the same objective point. Each of these armies\r\nmarched upon two or more adjacent parallel routes, but it could not be\r\nsaid that there were as many lines of operations as roads. The principal\r\nline of operations is that followed by the bulk of the army, and upon\r\nwhich depots of provisions, munitions, and other supplies are echeloned,\r\nand over which, if compelled, it would retreat.\r\n\r\nIf the choice of a zone of operations involves no extensive\r\ncombinations, since there can never be more than two or three zones on\r\neach theater, and the advantages generally result from the localities,\r\nit is somewhat different with lines of operations, as they are divided\r\ninto different classes, according to their relations to the different\r\npositions of the enemy, to the communications upon the strategic field,\r\nand to the enterprises projected by the commander.\r\n\r\n_Simple lines of operations_ are those of an army acting from a\r\nfrontier when it is not subdivided into large independent bodies.\r\n\r\n_Double lines of operations_ are those of two independent armies\r\nproceeding from the same frontier, or those of two nearly equal armies\r\nwhich are commanded by the same general but are widely separated in\r\ndistance and for long intervals of time.[11]\r\n\r\n_Interior lines of operations_ are those adopted by one or two armies to\r\noppose several hostile bodies, and having such a direction that the\r\ngeneral can concentrate the masses and maneuver with his whole force in\r\na shorter period of time than it would require for the enemy to oppose\r\nto them a greater force.[12] _Exterior lines_ lead to the opposite\r\nresult, and are those formed by an army which operates at the same time\r\non both flanks of the enemy, or against several of his masses.\r\n\r\n_Concentric lines of operations_ are those which depart from\r\nwidely-separated points and meet at the same point, either in advance\r\nof or behind the base.\r\n\r\n_Divergent lines_ are those by which an army would leave a given point\r\nto move upon several distinct points. These lines, of course,\r\nnecessitate a subdivision of the army.\r\n\r\nThere are also _deep lines_, which are simply _long lines_.\r\n\r\nThe term _maneuver-lines_ I apply to momentary strategic lines, often\r\nadopted for a single temporary maneuver, and which are by no means to be\r\nconfounded with the real _lines of operations_.\r\n\r\n_Secondary lines_ are those of two armies acting so as to afford each\r\nother mutual support,--as, in 1796, the army of the Sambre and Meuse was\r\nsecondary to the army of the Rhine, and, in 1812, the army of Bagration\r\nwas secondary to that of Barclay.\r\n\r\n_Accidental lines_ are those brought about by events which change the\r\noriginal plan and give a new direction to operations. These are of the\r\nhighest importance. The proper occasions for their use are fully\r\nrecognized only by a great and active mind.\r\n\r\nThere may be, in addition, _provisional_ and _definitive lines of\r\noperations_. The first designate the line adopted by an army in a\r\npreliminary, decisive enterprise, after which it is at liberty to select\r\na more advantageous or direct line. They seem to belong as much to the\r\nclass of temporary or eventual strategic lines as to the class of lines\r\nof operations.\r\n\r\nThese definitions show how I differ from those authors who have preceded\r\nme. Lloyd and Bulow attribute to these lines no other importance than\r\nthat arising from their relations to the depots of the army: the latter\r\nhas even asserted that when an army is encamped near its depots it has\r\nno lines of operations.\r\n\r\nThe following example will disprove this paradox. Let us suppose two\r\narmies, the first on the Upper Rhine, the second in advance of\r\nDusseldorf or any other point of this frontier, and that their large\r\ndepots are immediately behind the river,--certainly the safest, nearest,\r\nand most advantageous position for them which could possibly be adopted.\r\nThese armies will have an offensive or defensive object: hence they\r\nwill certainly have lines of operations, arising from the different\r\nproposed enterprises.\r\n\r\n1. Their defensive territorial line, starting from their positions, will\r\nextend to the second line which they are to cover, and they would both\r\nbe cut off from this second line should the enemy establish himself in\r\nthe interval which separates them from it. Even if Mélas[13] had\r\npossessed a year's supplies in Alessandria, he would none the less have\r\nbeen cut off from his base of the Mincio as soon as the victorious enemy\r\noccupied the line of the Po.\r\n\r\n2. Their line would be double, and the enemy's single if he concentrated\r\nhis forces to defeat these armies successively; it would be a double\r\nexterior line, and the enemy's a double interior, if the latter divided\r\nhis forces into two masses, giving them such directions as to enable him\r\nto concentrate all his forces before the two armies first referred to\r\ncould unite.\r\n\r\nBulow would have been more nearly right had he asserted that an army on\r\nits own soil is less dependent on its primitive line of operations than\r\nwhen on foreign ground; for it finds in every direction points of\r\nsupport and some of the advantages which are sought for in the\r\nestablishment of lines of operations; it may even lose its line of\r\noperations without incurring great danger; but that is no reason why it\r\nhas no line of operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS UPON THE LINES OF OPERATIONS IN THE WARS OF THE FRENCH\r\nREVOLUTION.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this terrible and ever-varying struggle, Prussia and\r\nAustria were the only avowed enemies of France, and Italy was included\r\nin the theater of war only for purposes of reciprocal observation, it\r\nbeing too remote for decisive enterprises in view of the end proposed.\r\nThe real theater extended from Huningue to Dunkirk, and comprised three\r\nzones of operations,--the first reaching along the Rhine from Huningue\r\nto Landau, and thence to the Moselle; the center consisting of the\r\ninterval between the Meuse and Moselle; the third and left was the\r\nfrontier from Givet to Dunkirk.\r\n\r\nWhen France declared war, in April, 1792, her intention was to prevent a\r\nunion of her enemies; and she had then one hundred thousand men in the\r\nzones just described, while Austria had but thirty-five thousand in\r\nBelgium. It is quite impossible to understand why the French did not\r\nconquer this country, when no effectual resistance could have been made.\r\nFour months intervened between the declaration of war and the\r\nconcentration of the allied troops. Was it not probable that an invasion\r\nof Belgium would have prevented that of Champagne, and have given the\r\nKing of Prussia a conception of the strength of France, and induced him\r\nnot to sacrifice his armies for the secondary object of imposing upon\r\nFrance another form of government?\r\n\r\nWhen the Prussians arrived at Coblentz, toward the end of July, the\r\nFrench were no longer able to invade. This _rôle_ was reserved for the\r\nallies; and it is well known how they acquitted themselves.\r\n\r\nThe whole force of the French was now about one hundred and fifteen\r\nthousand men. It was scattered over a frontier of one hundred and forty\r\nleagues and divided into five corps d'armée, and could not make a good\r\ndefense; for to paralyze them and prevent their concentration it was\r\nonly necessary to attack the center. Political reasons were also in\r\nfavor of this plan of attack: the end proposed was political, and could\r\nonly be attained by rapid and vigorous measures. The line between the\r\nMoselle and Meuse, which was the center, was less fortified than the\r\nrest of the frontier, and, besides, gave the allies the advantage of the\r\nexcellent fortress of Luxembourg as a base. They wisely adopted this\r\nplan of attack; but the execution was not equal to the conception.\r\n\r\nThe court of Vienna had the greatest interest in the war, for family\r\nreasons, as well as on account of the dangers to which a reverse might\r\nsubject her provinces. For some reason, difficult to understand,\r\nAustria co-operated only to the extent of thirty battalions: forty-five\r\nthousand men remained as an army of observation in Brisgau, on the\r\nRhine, and in Flanders. Where were the imposing armies she afterward\r\ndisplayed? and what more useful disposition could have been made of them\r\nthan to protect the flanks of the invading army? This remarkable conduct\r\non the part of Austria, which cost her so much, may account for the\r\nresolution of Prussia to retire at a later period, and quit the field,\r\nas she did, at the very moment when she should have entered it. During\r\nthe campaign the Prussians did not exhibit the activity necessary for\r\nsuccess. They spent eight days uselessly in camp at Kons. If they had\r\nanticipated Dumouriez at the Little Islands, or had even made a more\r\nserious effort to drive him from them, they would still have had all the\r\nadvantage of a concentrated force against several scattered divisions,\r\nand could have prevented their junction and overthrown them separately.\r\nFrederick the Great would have justified the remark of Dumouriez at\r\nGrandpré,--that, if his antagonist had been the great king, he\r\n(Dumouriez) would already have been driven behind Châlons.\r\n\r\nThe Austrians in this campaign proved that they were still imbued with\r\nthe false system of Daun and Lascy, of covering every point in order to\r\nguard every point.\r\n\r\nThe fact of having twenty thousand men in Brisgau while the Moselle and\r\nSarre were uncovered, shows the fear they had of losing a village, and\r\nhow their system led to large detachments, which are frequently the ruin\r\nof armies.\r\n\r\nForgetting that the surest hope of victory lies in presenting the\r\nstrongest force, they thought it necessary to occupy the whole length of\r\na frontier to prevent invasion,--which was exactly the means of\r\nrendering invasion upon every point feasible.\r\n\r\nI will further observe that, in thin campaign, Dumouriez foolishly\r\nabandoned the pursuit of the allies in order to transfer the theater\r\nfrom the center to the extreme left of the general field. Moreover, he\r\nwas unable to perceive the great results rendered possible by this\r\nmovement, but attacked the army of the Duke of Saxe-Teschen in front,\r\nwhile by descending the Meuse to Namur he might have thrown it back upon\r\nthe North Sea toward Meuport or Ostend, and have destroyed it entirely\r\nin a more successful battle than that of Jemmapes.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1793 affords a new instance of the effect of a faulty\r\ndirection of operations. The Austrians were victorious, and recovered\r\nBelgium, because Dumouriez unskillfully extended his front of operations\r\nto the gates of Rotterdam. Thus far the conduct of the allies deserves\r\npraise: the desire of reconquering these rich provinces justified this\r\nenterprise, which, moreover, was judiciously directed against the\r\nextreme right of the long front of Dumouriez. But after the French had\r\nbeen driven back under the guns of Valenciennes, and were disorganized\r\nand unable to resist, why did the allies remain six months in front of a\r\nfew towns and permit the Committee of Public Safety to organize new\r\narmies? When the deplorable condition of France and the destitution of\r\nthe wreck of the army of Dampierre are considered, can the parades of\r\nthe allies in front of the fortresses in Flanders be understood?\r\n\r\nInvasions of a country whose strength lies mainly in the capital are\r\nparticularly advantageous. Under the government of a powerful prince,\r\nand in ordinary wars, the most important point is the head-quarters of\r\nthe army; but under a weak prince, in a republic, and still more in wars\r\nof opinion, the capital is generally the center of national power.[14]\r\nIf this is ever doubtful, it was not so on this occasion. Paris was\r\nFrance, and this to such an extent that two-thirds of the nation had\r\nrisen against the government which oppressed them. If, after having\r\nbeaten the French army at Famars, the allies had left the Dutch and\r\nHanoverians to observe what remained of it, while the English and the\r\nAustrians directed their operations upon the Meuse, the Sarre, and the\r\nMoselle, in concert with the Prussians and a part of the useless army\r\nof the Upper Rhine, a force of one hundred and twenty thousand men, with\r\nits flanks protected by other troops, could have been pushed forward. It\r\nis even probable that, without changing the direction of the war or\r\nrunning great risks, the Dutch and Hanoverians could have performed the\r\nduty of observing Maubeuge and Valenciennes, while the bulk of the army\r\npursued the remains of Dampierre's forces. After gaining several\r\nvictories, however, two hundred thousand men were engaged in carrying on\r\na few sieges and were not gaining a foot of ground. While they\r\nthreatened France with invasion, they placed fifteen or sixteen bodies\r\nof troops, defensively, to cover their own frontier! When Valenciennes\r\nand Mayence capitulated, instead of falling with all their forces upon\r\nthe camp at Cambray, they flew off, excentrically, to Dunkirk on one\r\nside and Landau on the other.\r\n\r\nIt is not less astonishing that, after making the greatest efforts in\r\nthe beginning of the campaign upon the right of the general field, they\r\nshould have shifted them afterward to the extreme left, so that while\r\nthe allies were operating in Flanders they were in no manner seconded or\r\naided by the imposing army upon the Rhine; and when, in its turn, this\r\narmy took up the offensive, the allies remained inactive upon the\r\nSambre. Do not these false combinations resemble those of Soubise and\r\nBroglie in 1761, and all the operations of the Seven Years' War?\r\n\r\nIn 1794 the phase of affairs is wholly changed. The French from a\r\npainful defensive pass to a brilliant offensive. The combinations of\r\nthis campaign were doubtless well considered; but it is wrong to\r\nrepresent them as forming a new system of war. To be convinced of this,\r\nit is only necessary to observe that the respective positions of the\r\narmies in this campaign and in that of 1757 were almost identical, and\r\nthe direction of the operations is quite the same. The French had four\r\ncorps, which constituted two armies, as the King of Prussia had four\r\ndivisions, which composed two armies.\r\n\r\nThese two large bodies took a concentric direction leading on Brussels,\r\nas Frederick and Schwerin had adopted in 1757 on Prague. The only\r\ndifference between the two plans is that the Austrian troops in Flanders\r\nwere not so much scattered as those of Brown in Bohemia; but this\r\ndifference is certainly not favorable to the plan of 1794. The position\r\nof the North Sea was also unfavorable for the latter plan. To outflank\r\nthe Austrian right, Pichegru was thrown between the sea and the mass of\r\nthe enemy,--a direction as dangerous and faulty as could be given to\r\ngreat operations. This movement was the same as that of Benningsen on\r\nthe Lower Vistula which almost lost the Russian army in 1807. The fate\r\nof the Prussian army, cut off from its communications and forced upon\r\nthe Baltic, is another proof of this truth.\r\n\r\nIf the Prince of Coburg had acted with ability, he could easily have\r\nmade Pichegru suffer for this audacious maneuver, which was performed a\r\nmonth before Jourdan was prepared to follow it up.\r\n\r\nThe center of the grand Austrian army intended to act upon the offensive\r\nwas before Landrecies; the army was composed of one hundred and six\r\nbattalions and one hundred and fifty squadrons; upon its right flank\r\nFlanders was covered by the corps d'armée of Clairfayt, and upon the\r\nleft Charleroi was covered by that of the Prince de Kaunitz. The gain of\r\na battle before Landrecies opened its gates; and upon General Chapuis\r\nwas found a plan of the diversion in Flanders: only _twelve battalions_\r\nwere sent to Clairfayt. A long time afterward, and after the French were\r\nknown to have been successful, the corps of the Duke of York marched to\r\nClairfayt's relief; but what was the use of the remainder of the army\r\nbefore Landrecies, after it was obliged by a loss of force to delay\r\ninvasion? The Prince of Coburg threw away all the advantages of his\r\ncentral position, by allowing the French to concentrate in Belgium and\r\nto beat all his large detachments in detail.\r\n\r\nFinally, the army moved, leaving a division at Cateau, and a part having\r\nbeen sent to the Prince de Kaunitz at Charleroi. If, instead of dividing\r\nthis grand army, it had been directed upon Turcoing, there would have\r\nbeen concentrated there one hundred battalions and one hundred and\r\nforty squadrons; and what must then have been the result of this famous\r\ndiversion of Pichegru, cut off from his own frontiers and shut up\r\nbetween the sea and two fortresses?\r\n\r\nThe plan of invasion adopted by the French had not only the radical\r\nerror of exterior lines: it also failed in execution. The diversion on\r\nCourtray took place on April 26, and Jourdan did not arrive at Charleroi\r\ntill the 3d of June,--more than a month afterward. Here was a splendid\r\nopportunity for the Austrians to profit by their central position. If\r\nthe Prussian army had maneuvered by its right and the Austrian army by\r\nits left,--that is, both upon the Meuse,--the state of affairs would\r\nhave been different. By establishing themselves in the center of a line\r\nof scattered forces they could have prevented the junction of the\r\ndifferent fractions. It may be dangerous in a battle to attack the\r\ncenter of a close line of troops when it can be simultaneously sustained\r\nby the wings and the reserves; but it is quite different on a line of\r\nthree hundred miles in extent.\r\n\r\nIn 1795 Prussia and Spain retired from the coalition, and the principal\r\ntheater of war was shifted from the Rhine to Italy,--which opened a new\r\nfield of glory for the French arms. Their lines of operations in this\r\ncampaign were double; they desired to operate by Dusseldorf and Manheim.\r\nClairfayt, wiser than his predecessors, concentrated his forces\r\nalternately upon these points, and gained victories at Manheim and in\r\nthe lines of Mayence so decisive that they caused the army of the Sambre\r\nand Meuse to recross the Rhine to cover the Moselle, and brought\r\nPichegru back to Landau.\r\n\r\nIn 1796 the lines of operations on the Rhine were copied from those of\r\n1757 and those in Flanders in 1794, but with different results. The\r\narmies of the Rhine, and of the Sambre and Meuse, set out from the\r\nextremities of the base, on routes converging to the Danube. As in 1794,\r\nthey were exterior lines. The Archduke Charles, more skillful than the\r\nPrince of Coburg, profited by his interior lines by concentrating his\r\nforces at a point nearer than that expected by the French. He then\r\nseized the instant when the Danube covered the corps of Latour, to\r\nsteal several marches upon Moreau and attack and overwhelm Jourdan: the\r\nbattle of Wurzburg decided the fate of Germany and compelled the army of\r\nMoreau to retreat.\r\n\r\nBonaparte now commences in Italy his extraordinary career. His plan is\r\nto separate the Piedmontese and Austrian armies. He succeeds by the\r\nbattle of Millesimo in causing them to take two exterior strategic\r\nlines, and beats them successively at Mondovi and Lodi. A formidable\r\narmy is collected in the Tyrol to raise the siege of Mantua: it commits\r\nthe error of marching there in two bodies separated by a lake. The\r\nlightning is not quicker than Napoleon. He raises the siege, abandons\r\nevery thing before Mantua, throws the greater part of his force upon the\r\nfirst column, which debouches by Brescia, beats it and forces it back\r\nupon the mountains: the second column arrives upon the same ground, and\r\nis there beaten in its turn, and compelled to retire into the Tyrol to\r\nkeep up its communications with the right. Wurmser, upon whom these\r\nlessons are lost, desires to cover the two lines of Roveredo and\r\nVicenza; Napoleon, after having overwhelmed and thrown the first back\r\nupon the Lavis, changes direction by the right, debouches by the gorges\r\nof the Brenta upon the left, and forces the remnant of this fine army to\r\ntake refuge in Mantua, where it is finally compelled to surrender.\r\n\r\nIn 1799 hostilities recommence: the French, punished for having formed\r\ntwo exterior lines in 1796, nevertheless, have three upon the Rhine and\r\nthe Danube. The army on the left observes the Lower Rhine, that of the\r\ncenter marches upon the Danube, Switzerland, flanking Italy and Swabia,\r\nbeing occupied by a third army as strong as both the others. _The three\r\narmies could be concentrated only in the valley of the Inn_, eighty\r\nleagues from their base of operations. The archduke has equal forces: he\r\nunites them against the center, which he defeats at Stockach, and the\r\narmy of Switzerland is compelled to evacuate the Grisons and Eastern\r\nSwitzerland. The allies in turn commit the same fault: instead of\r\nfollowing up their success on this central line, which cost them so\r\ndearly afterward, they formed a double line in Switzerland and on the\r\nLower Rhine. The army of Switzerland is beaten at Zurich, while the\r\nother trifles at Manheim.\r\n\r\nIn Italy the French undertake a double enterprise, which leaves\r\nthirty-two thousand men uselessly employed at Naples, while upon the\r\nAdige, where the vital blows were to be given or received, their force\r\nis too weak and meets with terrible reverses. When the army of Naples\r\nreturns to the North, it commits the error of adopting a strategic\r\ndirection opposed to Moreau's, and Suwaroff, by means of his central\r\nposition, from which he derives full profit, marches against this army\r\nand beats it, while some leagues from the other.\r\n\r\nIn 1800, Napoleon has returned from Egypt, and every thing is again\r\nchanged, and this campaign presents a new combination of lines of\r\noperations; one hundred and fifty thousand men march upon the two flanks\r\nof Switzerland, and debouch, one upon the Danube and the other upon the\r\nPo. This insures the conquest of vast regions. Modern history affords no\r\nsimilar combination. The French armies are upon interior lines,\r\naffording reciprocal support, while the Austrians are compelled to adopt\r\nan exterior line, which renders it impossible for them to communicate.\r\nBy a skillful arrangement of its progress, the army of the reserve cuts\r\noff the enemy from his line of operations, at the same time preserving\r\nits own relations with its base and with the army of the Rhine, which\r\nforms its secondary line.\r\n\r\nFig. 3 demonstrates this truth, and shows the respective situations of\r\nthe two parties. A and A A indicate the front of operations of the\r\narmies of the Rhine and of the reserve; B and B B, that of Kray and\r\nMélas; C C C C, the passes of the Saint-Bernard, of the Simplon, of the\r\nSaint-Gothard, and of the Splugen; D indicates the two lines of\r\noperations of the army of the reserve; E, the two lines of retreat of\r\nMélas; H J K, the French divisions preserving their line of retreat. It\r\nmay thus be seen that Mélas is cut off from his base, and that, on the\r\ncontrary, the French general runs no risk, since he preserves all his\r\ncommunications with the frontiers and with his secondary lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. THE STRATIGIC FIELD OF 1806.]\r\n\r\nThe analysis of the memorable events just sketched shows clearly the\r\nimportance of a proper selection of lines of maneuver in military\r\noperations. Indeed, discretion on this point may repair the disasters of\r\ndefeat, destroy the advantages of an adversary's victory, render his\r\ninvasion futile, or assure the conquest of a province.\r\n\r\nBy a comparison of the combinations and results of the most noted\r\ncampaigns, it will be seen that the lines of operations which have led\r\nto success have been established in conformity to the fundamental\r\nprinciple already alluded to,--viz.: that _simple and interior lines\r\nenable a general to bring into action, by strategic movements, upon the\r\nimportant point, a stronger force than the enemy_. The student may also\r\nsatisfy himself that those which have failed contained faults opposed to\r\nthis principle. An undue number of lines divides the forces, and permits\r\nfractions to be overwhelmed by the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIMS ON LINES OF OPERATIONS.\r\n\r\nFrom the analysis of all the events herein referred to, as well as from\r\nthat of many others, the following maxims result:--\r\n\r\n1. If the art of war consists in bringing into action upon the decisive\r\npoint of the theater of operations the greatest possible force, the\r\nchoice of the line of operations, being the primary means of attaining\r\nthis end, may be regarded as the fundamental idea in a good plan of a\r\ncampaign. Napoleon proved this by the direction he gave his armies in\r\n1805 on Donauwerth and in 1806 on Gera,--maneuvers that cannot be too\r\nmuch studied by military men.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is impossible to sketch in advance the whole campaign. The\r\nobjective point will be determined upon in advance, the general plan to\r\nbe followed to attain it, and the first enterprise to be undertaken for\r\nthis end: what is to follow will depend upon the result of this first\r\noperation and the new phases it may develop.\r\n\r\n2. The direction to be given to this line depends upon the geographical\r\nsituation of the theater of operations, but still more upon the position\r\nof the hostile masses upon this strategic field. _In every case,\r\nhowever, it must be directed upon the center or upon one of the\r\nextremities. Only when the assailing forces are vastly preponderating\r\nwould it be otherwise than a fatal error to act upon the center and the\r\ntwo extremities at the same time_.[15]\r\n\r\nIt may be laid down as a general principle, that, if the enemy divide\r\nhis forces on an extended front, the best direction of the maneuver-line\r\nwill be upon his center, but in every other case, when it is possible,\r\nthe best direction will be upon one of the flanks, and then upon the\r\nrear of his line of defense or front of operations.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of this maneuver arises more from the opportunity it\r\naffords of taking the line of defense in reverse than from the fact that\r\nby using it the assailant has to contend with but a part of the enemy's\r\nforce. Thus, the army of the Rhine in 1800, gaining the extreme left of\r\nthe line of defense of the Black Forest, caused it to yield almost\r\nwithout an effort. This army fought two battles on the right bank of the\r\nDanube, which, although not decisive, yet, from the judicious direction\r\nof the line of operations, brought about the invasion of Swabia and\r\nBavaria. The results of the march of the army of the reserve by the\r\nSaint-Bernard and Milan upon the extreme right of Mélas were still more\r\nbrilliant.\r\n\r\n3. Even when the extremity of the enemy's front of operations is gained,\r\nit is not always safe to act upon his rear, since by so doing the\r\nassailant in many cases will lose his own communications. To avoid this\r\ndanger, the line of operations should have a geographic and strategic\r\ndirection, such that the army will always find either to its rear or to\r\nthe right or left a safe line of retreat. In this case, to take\r\nadvantage of either of these flank lines of retreat would require a\r\nchange of direction of the line of operations, (Maxim 12.)\r\n\r\nThe ability to decide upon such a direction is among the most important\r\nqualities of a general. The importance of a direction is illustrated by\r\nthese examples.\r\n\r\nIf Napoleon in 1800, after passing the Saint-Bernard, had marched upon\r\nAsti or Alessandria, and had fought at Marengo without having previously\r\nprotected himself on the side of Lombardy and of the left bank of the\r\nPo, he would have been more thoroughly cut off from his line of retreat\r\nthan Mélas from his; but, having in his possession the secondary points\r\nof Casale and Pavia on the side of the Saint-Bernard, and Savona and\r\nTenda toward the Apennines, in case of reverse he had every means of\r\nregaining the Var or the Valais.\r\n\r\nIn 1806, if he had marched from Gera directly upon Leipsic, and had\r\nthere awaited the Prussian army returning from Weimar, he would have\r\nbeen cut off from the Rhine as much as the Duke of Brunswick from the\r\nElbe, while by falling back to the west in the direction of Weimar he\r\nplaced his front before the three roads of Saalfeld, Schleiz, and Hof,\r\nwhich thus became well-covered lines of communication. If the Prussians\r\nhad endeavored to cut him off from these lines by moving between Gera\r\nand Baireuth, they would have opened to him his most natural line,--the\r\nexcellent road from Leipsic to Frankfort,--as well as the two roads\r\nwhich lead from Saxony by Cassel to Coblentz, Cologne, and even Wesel.\r\n\r\n4. Two independent armies should not be formed upon the same frontier:\r\nsuch an arrangement could be proper only in the case of large\r\ncoalitions, or where the forces at disposal are too numerous to act upon\r\nthe same zone of operations; and even in this case it would be better to\r\nhave all the forces under the same commander, who accompanies the\r\nprincipal army.\r\n\r\n5. As a consequence of the last-mentioned principle, with equal forces\r\non the same frontier, a single line of operations will be more\r\nadvantageous than a double one.\r\n\r\n6. It may happen, however, that a double line will be necessary, either\r\nfrom the topography of the seat of war, or because a double line has\r\nbeen adopted by the enemy, and it will be necessary to oppose a part of\r\nthe army to each of his masses.\r\n\r\n7. In this case, interior or central lines will be preferable to\r\nexterior lines, since in the former case the fractions of the army can\r\nbe concentrated before those of the enemy, and may thus decide the fate\r\nof the campaign.[16] Such an army may, by a well-combined strategic\r\nplan, unite upon and overwhelm successively the fractions of the\r\nadversary's forces. To be assured of success in these maneuvers, a body\r\nof observation is left in front of the army to be held in check, with\r\ninstructions to avoid a serious engagement, but to delay the enemy as\r\nmuch as possible by taking advantage of the ground, continually falling\r\nback upon the principal army.\r\n\r\n8. A double line is applicable in the case of a decided superiority of\r\nforce, when each army will be a match for any force the enemy can bring\r\nagainst it. In this case this course will be advantageous,--since a\r\nsingle line would crowd the forces so much as to prevent them all from\r\nacting to advantage. However, it will always be prudent to support well\r\nthe army which, by reason of the nature of its theater and the\r\nrespective positions of the parties, has the most important duty to\r\nperform.\r\n\r\n9 The principal events of modern wars demonstrate the truth of two other\r\nmaxims. The first is, that two armies operating on interior lines and\r\nsustaining each other reciprocally, and opposing two armies superior in\r\nnumbers, should not allow themselves to be crowded into a too contracted\r\nspace, where the whole might be overwhelmed at once. This happened to\r\nNapoleon at Leipsic.[17] The second is, that interior lines should not\r\nbe abused by extending them too far, thus giving the enemy the\r\nopportunity of overcoming the corps of observation. This risk, however,\r\nmay be incurred if the end pursued by the main forces is so decisive as\r\nto conclude the war,--when the fate of these secondary bodies would be\r\nviewed with comparative indifference.\r\n\r\n10. For the same reason, two converging lines are more advantageous than\r\ntwo divergent. The first conform better to the principles of strategy,\r\nand possess the advantage of covering the lines of communication and\r\nsupply; but to be free from danger they should be so arranged that the\r\narmies which pass over them shall not be separately exposed to the\r\ncombined masses of the enemy, before being able to effect their\r\njunction.\r\n\r\n11. Divergent lines, however, may be advantageous when the center of the\r\nenemy has been broken and his forces separated either by a battle or by\r\na strategic movement,--in which case divergent operations would add to\r\nthe dispersion of the enemy. Such divergent lines would be interior,\r\nsince the pursuers could concentrate with more facility than the\r\npursued.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. It sometimes happens that an army is obliged to change its line of\r\noperations in the middle of a campaign. This is a very delicate and\r\nimportant step, which may lead to great successes, or to equally great\r\ndisasters if not applied with sagacity, and is used only to extricate an\r\narmy from an embarrassing position. Napoleon projected several of these\r\nchanges; for in his bold invasions he was provided with new plans to\r\nmeet unforeseen events.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Austerlitz, if defeated, he had resolved to adopt a\r\nline of operations through Bohemia on Passau or Ratisbon, which would\r\nhave opened a new and rich country to him, instead of returning by\r\nVienna, which route lay through an exhausted country and from which the\r\nArchduke Charles was endeavoring to cut him off. Frederick executed one\r\nof these changes of the line of operations after the raising of the\r\nsiege of Olmutz.\r\n\r\nIn 1814 Napoleon commenced the execution of a bolder maneuver, but one\r\nwhich was favored by the localities. It was to base himself upon the\r\nfortresses of Alsace and Lorraine, leaving the route to Paris open to\r\nthe allies. If Mortier and Marmont could have joined him, and had he\r\npossessed fifty thousand more men, this plan would have produced the\r\nmost decisive results and have put the seal on his military career.\r\n\r\n13. As before stated, the outline of the frontiers, and the geographical\r\ncharacter of the theater of operations, exercise a great influence on\r\nthe direction to be given to these lines, as well as upon the advantages\r\nto be obtained. Central positions, salient toward the enemy, like\r\nBohemia and Switzerland, are the most advantageous, because they\r\nnaturally lead to the adoption of interior lines and facilitate the\r\nproject of taking the enemy in reverse. The sides of this salient angle\r\nbecome so important that every means should be taken to render them\r\nimpregnable. In default of such central positions, their advantages may\r\nbe gained by the relative directions of maneuver-lines, as the following\r\nfigure will explain. C D maneuvering upon the right of the front of the\r\narmy A B, and H I upon the left flank of G F, will form two interior\r\nlines I K and C K upon an extremity of the exterior lines A B, F G,\r\nwhich they may overwhelm separately by combining upon them. Such was the\r\nresult of the operations of 1796, 1800, and 1809.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n                        Fig. 4.\r\n\r\n                                K\r\n                               /\\\r\n                              /  \\\r\n                             /    \\\r\n                            /      \\\r\n  F LLLLLLLLLLLLL G        /        \\        A LLLLLLLLLLLLLL B\r\n                          /          \\\r\n                         /            \\\r\n                        /              \\\r\n                       /                \\\r\n                      /                  \\\r\n                     /                    \\\r\n                    /                      \\\r\n                   /                        \\\r\n  H TTTTTTTTTTTTT I                          C TTTTTTTTTTTTTT D\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n14. The general configuration of the bases ought also to influence the\r\ndirection to be given to the lines of operations, these latter being\r\nnaturally dependent upon the former. It has already been shown that the\r\ngreatest advantage that can result from a choice of bases is when the\r\nfrontiers allow it to be assumed parallel to the line of operations of\r\nthe enemy, thus affording the opportunity of seizing this line and\r\ncutting him from his base.\r\n\r\nBut if, instead of directing the operations upon the decisive point, the\r\nline of operations be badly chosen, all the advantages of the\r\nperpendicular base may be lost, as will be seen by referring to the\r\nfigure on page 79. The army E, having the double base A C and C D, if it\r\nmarched toward F, instead of to the right toward G H, would lose all the\r\nstrategic advantages of its base C D.\r\n\r\nThe great art, then, of properly directing lines of operations, is so to\r\nestablish them in reference to the bases and to the marches of the army\r\nas to seize the communications of the enemy without imperiling one's\r\nown, and is the most important and most difficult problem in strategy.\r\n\r\n15. There is another point which exercises a manifest influence over the\r\ndirection to be given to the line of operations; it is when the\r\nprincipal enterprise of the campaign is to cross a large river in the\r\npresence of a numerous and well-appointed enemy. In this case, the\r\nchoice of this line depends neither upon the will of the general nor the\r\nadvantages to be gained by an attack on one or another point; for the\r\nfirst consideration will be to ascertain where the passage can be most\r\ncertainly effected, and where are to be found the means for this\r\npurpose. The passage of the Rhine in 1795, by Jourdan, was near\r\nDusseldorf, for the same reason that the Vistula in 1831 was crossed by\r\nMarshal Paskevitch near Ossiek,--viz., that in neither case was there\r\nthe bridge-train necessary for the purpose, and both were obliged to\r\nprocure and take up the rivers large boats, bought by the French in\r\nHolland, and by the Russians at Thorn and Dantzic. The neutrality of\r\nPrussia permitted the ascent of the river in both cases, and the enemy\r\nwas not able to prevent it. This apparently incalculable advantage led\r\nthe French into the double invasions of 1795 and 1796, which failed\r\nbecause the double line of operations caused the defeat of the armies\r\nseparately. Paskevitch was wiser, and passed the Upper Vistula with only\r\na small detachment and after the principal army had already arrived at\r\nLowicz.\r\n\r\nWhen an army is sufficiently provided with bridge-trains, the chances\r\nof failure are much lessened; but then, as always, it is necessary to\r\nselect the point which may, either on account of its topography or the\r\nposition of the enemy, be most advantageous. The discussion between\r\nNapoleon and Moreau on the passage of the Rhine in 1800 is one of the\r\nmost curious examples of the different combinations presented by this\r\nquestion, which is both strategic and tactical.\r\n\r\nSince it is necessary to protect the bridges, at least until a victory\r\nis gained, the point of passage will exercise an influence upon the\r\ndirections of a few marches immediately subsequent to the passage. The\r\npoint selected in every case for the principal passage will be upon the\r\ncenter or one of the flanks of the enemy.\r\n\r\nA united army which has forced a passage upon the center of an extended\r\nline might afterward adopt two divergent lines to complete the\r\ndispersion of the enemy, who, being unable to concentrate, would not\r\nthink of disturbing the bridges.\r\n\r\nIf the line of the river is so short that the hostile army is more\r\nconcentrated, and the general has the means of taking up after the\r\npassage a front perpendicular to the river, it would be better to pass\r\nit upon one of the extremities, in order to throw off the enemy from the\r\nbridges. This will be referred to in the article upon the passage of\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\n16. There is yet another combination of lines of operations to be\r\nnoticed. It is the marked difference of advantage between a line at home\r\nand one in a hostile country. The nature of the enemy's country will\r\nalso influence these chances. Let us suppose an army crosses the Alps or\r\nthe Rhine to carry on war in Italy or Germany. It encounters states of\r\nthe second rank; and, even if they are in alliance, there are always\r\nrivalries or collisions of interest which will deprive them of that\r\nunity and strength possessed by a single powerful state. On the other\r\nhand, a German army invading France would operate upon a line much more\r\ndangerous than that of the French in Italy, because upon the first could\r\nbe thrown the consolidated strength of Franco, united in feeling and\r\ninterest. An army on the defensive, with its line of operations on its\r\nown soil, has resources everywhere and in every thing: the inhabitants,\r\nauthorities, productions, towns, public depots and arsenals, and even\r\nprivate stores, are all in its favor. It is not ordinarily so abroad.\r\n\r\nLines of operations in rich, fertile, manufacturing regions offer to the\r\nassailants much greater advantages than when in barren or desert\r\nregions, particularly when the people are not united against the\r\ninvader. In provinces like those first named the army would find a\r\nthousand necessary supplies, while in the other huts and straw are about\r\nthe only resources. Horses probably may obtain pasturage; but every\r\nthing else must be carried by the army,--thus infinitely increasing the\r\nembarrassments and rendering bold operations much more rare and\r\ndangerous. The French armies, so long accustomed to the comforts of\r\nSwabia and Lombardy, almost perished in 1806 in the bogs of Pultusk, and\r\nactually did perish in 1812 in the marshy forests of Lithuania.\r\n\r\n17. There is another point in reference to these lines which is much\r\ninsisted upon by some, but which is more specious than important. It is\r\nthat on each side of the line of operations the country should be\r\ncleared of all enemies for a distance equal to the depth of this line:\r\notherwise the enemy might threaten the line of retreat. This rule is\r\neverywhere belied by the events of war. The nature of the country, the\r\nrivers and mountains, the morale of the armies, the spirit of the\r\npeople, the ability and energy of the commanders, cannot be estimated by\r\ndiagrams on paper. It is true that no considerable bodies of the enemy\r\ncould be permitted on the flanks of the line of retreat; but a\r\ncompliance with this demand would deprive an army of every means of\r\ntaking a step in a hostile country; and there is not a campaign in\r\nrecent wars, or in those of Marlborough and Eugene, which does not\r\ncontradict this assertion. Was not General Moreau at the gates of Vienna\r\nwhen Fussen, Scharnitz, and all the Tyrol were in possession of the\r\nAustrians? Was not Napoleon at Piacenza when Turin, Genoa, and the\r\nCol-di-Tenda were occupied by the army of Mélas? Did not Eugene march by\r\nway of Stradella and Asti to the aid of Turin, leaving the French upon\r\nthe Mincio but a few leagues from his base?\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS UPON INTERIOR LINES--WHAT HAS BEEN SAID AGAINST THEM.\r\n\r\nSome of my critics have disputed as to the meaning of words and upon\r\ndefinitions; others have censured where they but imperfectly understood;\r\nand others have, by the light of certain important events, taken it upon\r\nthemselves to deny my fundamental principles, without inquiring whether\r\nthe conditions of the case which might modify the application of these\r\nprinciples were such as were supposed, or without reflecting that, even\r\nadmitting what they claimed to be true, a single exception cannot\r\ndisprove a rule based upon the experience of ages and upon natural\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to my maxims upon interior lines, some have quoted the\r\nfamous and successful march of the allies upon Leipsic. This remarkable\r\nevent, at first glance, seems to stagger the faith of those who believe\r\nin principles. At best, however, it is but one of those exceptional\r\ncases from which nothing can be inferred in the face of thousands of\r\nopposed instances. Moreover, it is easy to show that, far from\r\noverthrowing the maxims it has been brought to oppose, it will go to\r\nestablish their soundness. Indeed, the critics had forgotten that in\r\ncase of a considerable numerical superiority I recommended double lines\r\nof operations as most advantageous, particularly when concentric and\r\narranged to combine an effort against the enemy at the decisive moment.\r\nNow, in the allied armies of Schwarzenberg, Blücher, Bernadotte, and\r\nBenningsen, this case of decided superiority is found. The inferior\r\narmy, to conform to the principles of this chapter, should have directed\r\nits efforts against one of the extremities of his adversary, and not\r\nupon the center as it did: so that the events quoted against me are\r\ndoubly in my favor.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if the central position of Napoleon between Dresden and the\r\nOder was disastrous, it must be attributed to the misfortunes of Culm,\r\nKatzbach, and Dennewitz,--in a word, to faults of execution, entirely\r\nforeign to the principles in question.\r\n\r\nWhat I propose is, to act offensively upon the most important point with\r\nthe greater part of the forces, but upon the secondary points to remain\r\non the defensive, in strong positions or behind a river, until the\r\ndecisive blow is struck, and the operation ended by the total defeat of\r\nan essential part of the army. Then the combined efforts of the whole\r\narmy may be directed upon other points. Whenever the secondary armies\r\nare exposed to a decisive shock during the absence of the mass of the\r\narmy, the system is not understood; and this was what happened in 1813.\r\n\r\nIf Napoleon, after his victory at Dresden, had vigorously pursued the\r\nallies into Bohemia, he would have escaped the disaster at Culm, have\r\nthreatened Prague, and perhaps have dissolved the Coalition. To this\r\nerror may be added a fault quite as great,--that of fighting decisive\r\nbattles when he was not present with the mass of his forces. At Katzbach\r\nhis instructions were not obeyed. He ordered Macdonald to wait for\r\nBlücher, and to fall upon him when he should expose himself by hold\r\nmovements. Macdonald, on the contrary, crossed his detachments over\r\ntorrents which were hourly becoming more swollen, and advanced to meet\r\nBlücher. If he had fulfilled his instructions and Napoleon had followed\r\nup his victory, there is no doubt that his plan of operations, based\r\nupon interior strategic lines and positions and upon a concentric line\r\nof operations, would have met with the most brilliant success. The study\r\nof his campaigns in Italy in 1796 and in France in 1814 shows that he\r\nknew how to apply this system.\r\n\r\nThere is another circumstance, of equal importance, which shows the\r\ninjustice of judging central lines by the fate of Napoleon in\r\nSaxony,--viz.: _that his front of operations was outflanked on the\r\nright, and even taken in reverse, by the geographical position of the\r\nfrontiers of Bohemia_. Such a case is of rare occurrence. A central\r\nposition with such faults is not to be compared to one without them.\r\nWhen Napoleon made the application of these principles in Italy, Poland,\r\nPrussia, and France, he was not exposed to the attack of a hostile\r\nenemy on his flanks and rear. Austria could have threatened him in 1807;\r\nbut she was then at peace with him and unarmed. To judge of a system of\r\noperations, it must be supposed that accidents and chances are to be as\r\nmuch in favor of as against it,--which was by no means the case in 1813,\r\neither in the geographic positions or in the state of the respective\r\nforces. Independently of this, it is absurd to quote the reverses at\r\nKatzbach and Dennewitz, suffered by his lieutenants, as proof capable of\r\ndestroying a principle the simplest application of which required these\r\nofficers not to allow themselves to be drawn into a serious engagement.\r\nInstead of avoiding they sought collisions. Indeed, what advantage can\r\nbe expected from the system of central lines, if the parts of the army\r\nwhich have been weakened in order to strike decisive blows elsewhere,\r\nshall themselves seek a disastrous contest, instead of being contented\r\nwith being bodies of observation?[18] In this case it is the enemy who\r\napplies the principle, and not he who has the interior lines. Moreover,\r\nin the succeeding campaign, the defense of Napoleon in Champagne, from\r\nthe battle of Brienne to that of Paris, demonstrates fully the truth of\r\nthese maxims.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of these two celebrated campaigns raises a strategic\r\nquestion which it would be difficult to answer by simple assertions\r\nfounded upon theories. It is, whether the system of central lines loses\r\nits advantages when the masses are very large. Agreeing with\r\nMontesquieu, that the greatest enterprises fail from the magnitude of\r\nthe arrangements necessary to consummate them, I am disposed to answer\r\nin the affirmative. It is very clear to me that an army of one hundred\r\nthousand men, occupying a central zone against three isolated armies of\r\nthirty or thirty-five thousand men, would be more sure of defeating them\r\nsuccessively than if the central mass were four hundred thousand strong\r\nagainst three armies of one hundred and thirty-five thousand each; and\r\nfor several good reasons:--\r\n\r\n1. Considering the difficulty of finding ground and time necessary to\r\nbring a very large force into action on the day of battle, an army of\r\none hundred and thirty or one hundred and forty thousand men may easily\r\nresist a much larger force.\r\n\r\n2. If driven from the field, there will be at least one hundred thousand\r\nmen to protect and insure an orderly retreat and effect a junction with\r\none of the other armies.\r\n\r\n3. The central army of four hundred thousand men requires such a\r\nquantity of provisions, munitions, horses, and _matériel_ of every kind,\r\nthat it will possess less mobility and facility in shifting its efforts\r\nfrom one part of the zone to another; to say nothing of the\r\nimpossibility of obtaining provisions from a region too restricted to\r\nsupport such numbers.\r\n\r\n4. The bodies of observation detached from the central mass to hold in\r\ncheck two armies of one hundred and thirty-five thousand each must be\r\nvery strong, (from eighty to ninety thousand each;) and, being of such\r\nmagnitude, if they are drawn into a serious engagement they will\r\nprobably suffer reverses, the effects of which might outweigh the\r\nadvantages gained by the principal army.\r\n\r\nI have never advocated exclusively either a concentric or eccentric\r\nsystem. All my works go to show the eternal influence of principles, and\r\nto demonstrate that operations to be successful must be applications of\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nDivergent or convergent operations may be either very good or very bad:\r\nall depends on the situation of the respective forces. The eccentric\r\nlines, for instance, are good when applied to a mass starting from a\r\ngiven point, and acting in divergent directions to divide and separately\r\ndestroy two hostile forces acting upon exterior lines. Such was the\r\nmaneuver of Frederick which brought about, at the end of the campaign of\r\n1767, the fine battles of Rossbach and Leuthen. Such were nearly all the\r\noperations of Napoleon, whose favorite maneuver was to unite, by\r\nclosely-calculated marches, imposing masses on the center, and, having\r\npierced the enemy's center or turned his front, to give them eccentric\r\ndirections to disperse the defeated army.[19]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, concentric operations are good in two cases: 1. When\r\nthey tend to concentrate a scattered army upon a point where it will be\r\nsure to arrive before the enemy; 2. When they direct to the same end the\r\nefforts of two armies which are in no danger of being beaten separately\r\nby a stronger enemy.\r\n\r\nConcentric operations, which just now seem to be so advantageous, may be\r\nmost pernicious,--which should teach us the necessity of detecting the\r\nprinciples upon which systems are based, and not to confound principles\r\nand systems; as, for instance, if two armies set out from a distant base\r\nto march convergently upon an enemy whose forces are on interior lines\r\nand more concentrated, it follows that the latter could effect a union\r\nbefore the former, and would inevitably defeat them; as was the case\r\nwith Moreau and Jourdan in 1796, opposed to the Archduke Charles.\r\n\r\nIn starting from the same points, or from two points much less separated\r\nthan Dusseldorf and Strasbourg, an army may be exposed to this danger.\r\nWhat was the fate of the concentric columns of Wurmser and\r\nQuasdanovitch, wishing to reach the Mincio by the two banks of Lake\r\nGarda? Can the result of the march of Napoleon and Grouchy on Brussels\r\nbe forgotten? Leaving Sombref, they were to march concentrically on this\r\ncity,--one by Quatre-Bras, the other by Wavre. Blücher and Wellington,\r\ntaking an interior strategic line, effected a junction before them, and\r\nthe terrible disaster of Waterloo proved to the world that the immutable\r\nprinciples of war cannot be violated with impunity.\r\n\r\nSuch events prove better than any arguments that a system which is not\r\nin accordance with the principles of war cannot be good. I lay no claim\r\nto the creation of these principles, for they have always existed, and\r\nwere applied by Cæsar, Scipio, and the Consul Nero, as well as by\r\nMarlborough and Eugene; but I claim to have been the first to point them\r\nout, and to lay down the principal chances in their various\r\napplications.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: This definition has been criticized; and, as it has given\r\nrise to misapprehension, it becomes necessary to explain it.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it must be borne in mind that it is a question of\r\n_maneuver-lines_, (that is, of strategic combinations,) and not of great\r\nroutes. It must also be admitted that an army marching upon two or three\r\nroutes, near enough to each other to admit of the concentration of the\r\ndifferent masses within forty-eight hours, would not have two or three\r\nlines of operations. When Moreau and Jourdan entered Germany with two\r\narmies of 70,000 men each, being independent of each other, there was a\r\ndouble line of operations; but a French army of which only a detachment\r\nstarts from the Lower Rhine to march on the Main, while the five or six\r\nother corps set out from the Upper Rhine to march on Ulm, would not have\r\na double line of operations in the sense in which I use the term to\r\ndesignate a maneuver. Napoleon, when he concentrated seven corps and set\r\nthem in motion by Bamberg to march on Gera, while Mortier with a single\r\ncorps marched on Cassel to occupy Hesse and flank the principal\r\nenterprise, had but a single general line of operations, with an\r\naccessory detachment. The territorial line was composed of two arms or\r\nradii, but the operation was not double.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Some German writers have said that I confound central\r\npositions with the line of operations,--in which assertion they are\r\nmistaken. An army may occupy a central position in the presence of two\r\nmasses of the enemy, and not have interior lines of operations: these\r\nare two very different things. Others have thought that I would have\r\ndone better to use the term _radii of operations_ to express the idea of\r\ndouble lines. The reasoning in this case is plausible if we conceive the\r\ntheater of operations to be a circle; but, as every radius is, after\r\nall, a line, it is simply a dispute about words.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: This assertion has been disputed. I think it is correct;\r\nfor Mélas, confined between the Bormida, the Tanaro, and the Po, was\r\nunable to recruit for his army, barely able to maintain a communication\r\nby couriers with his base, and he certainly would have been obliged to\r\ncut his way out or to surrender in case he had not been reinforced.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: The capture of Paris by the allies decided the fate of\r\nNapoleon; but he had no army, and was attacked by all Europe, and the\r\nFrench people had, in addition, separated their cause from his. If he\r\nhad possessed fifty thousand more old soldiers, he would have shown that\r\nthe capital was at his head-quarters.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: The inferiority of an army does not depend exclusively\r\nupon the number of soldiers: their military qualities, their _morale_,\r\nand the ability of their commander are also very important elements.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: When the fractions of an army are separated from the main\r\nbody by only a few marches, and particularly when they are not intended\r\nto act separately throughout the campaign, these are central strategic\r\npositions, and not lines of operations.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: In the movements immediately preceding the battle of\r\nLeipsic, Napoleon, strictly speaking, had but a single line of\r\noperations, and his armies were simply in central strategic positions;\r\nbut the principle is the same, and hence the example is illustrative of\r\nlines of operations.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: I am well aware that it is not always possible to avoid a\r\ncombat without running greater risks than would result from a check; but\r\nMacdonald might have fought Blücher to advantage if he had better\r\nunderstood Napoleon's instructions.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: It will not be thought strange that I sometimes approve of\r\nconcentric, and at other times divergent, maneuvers, when we reflect\r\nthat among the finest operations of Napoleon there are some in which he\r\nemployed these two systems alternately within twenty-four hours; for\r\nexample, in the movements about Ratisbon in 1809.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXII.\r\n\r\nStrategic Lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nMention has already been made of strategic lines of maneuvers, which\r\ndiffer essentially from lines of operations; and it will be well to\r\ndefine them, for many confound them. We will not consider those\r\nstrategic lines which have a great and permanent importance by reason of\r\ntheir position and their relation to the features of the country, like\r\nthe lines of the Danube and the Meuse, the chains of the Alps and the\r\nBalkan. Such lines can best be studied by a detailed and minute\r\nexamination of the topography of Europe; and an excellent model for this\r\nkind of study is found in the Archduke Charles's description of Southern\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nThe term _strategic_ is also applied to all communications which lead by\r\nthe most direct or advantageous route from one important point to\r\nanother, as well as from the strategic front of the army to all of its\r\nobjective points. It will be seen, then, that a theater of war is\r\ncrossed by a multitude of such lines, but that at any given time those\r\nonly which are concerned in the projected enterprise have any real\r\nimportance. This renders plain the distinction between the general line\r\nof operations of a whole campaign, and these _strategic_ lines, which\r\nare temporary and change with the operations of the army.\r\n\r\nBesides territorial strategic lines, there are _strategic lines of\r\nmaneuvers_.\r\n\r\nAn army having Germany as its general field might adopt as its zone of\r\noperations the space between the Alps and the Danube, or that between\r\nthe Danube and the Main, or that between the mountains of Franconia and\r\nthe sea. It would have upon its zone a single line of operations, or, at\r\nmost, a double concentric line, upon interior, or perhaps exterior,\r\ndirections,--while it would have successively perhaps twenty strategic\r\nlines as its enterprises were developed: it would have at first one for\r\neach wing which would join the general line of operations. If it\r\noperated in the zone between the Danube and the Alps, it might adopt,\r\naccording to events, the strategic line leading from Ulm on Donauwerth\r\nand Ratisbon, or that from Ulm to the Tyrol, or that which connects Ulm\r\nwith Nuremberg or Mayence.\r\n\r\nIt may, then, be assumed that the definitions applied to lines of\r\noperations, as well as the maxims referring to them, are necessarily\r\napplicable to strategic lines. These may be _concentric_, to inflict a\r\ndecisive blow, or _eccentric_, after victory. They are rarely _simple_,\r\nsince an army does not confine its march to a single road; but when they\r\nare double or triple, or even quadruple, they should be _interior_ if\r\nthe forces be equal, or _exterior_ in the case of great numerical\r\nsuperiority. The rigorous application of this rule may perhaps sometimes\r\nbe remitted in detaching a body on an exterior line, even when the\r\nforces are equal, to attain an important result without running much\r\nrisk; but this is an affair of detachments, and does not refer to the\r\nimportant masses.\r\n\r\nStrategic lines cannot be interior when our efforts are directed against\r\none of the extremities of the enemy's front of operations.\r\n\r\nThe maxims above given in reference to lines of operations holding good\r\nfor strategic lines, it is not necessary to repeat them, or to apply\r\nthem to particular examples; but there is one, however, which deserves\r\nmention,--viz.: that it is important generally, in the selection of\r\nthese temporary strategic lines, not to leave the line of operations\r\nexposed to the assaults of the enemy. Even this may, however, be done,\r\nto extricate the army from great danger, or to attain a great success;\r\nbut the operation must be of short duration, and care must have been\r\ntaken to prepare a plan of safe retreat, by a sudden change of the line\r\nof operations, if necessary, as has already been referred to.\r\n\r\nWe will illustrate this by the campaign of Waterloo. The Prussian army\r\nwas based upon the Rhine, its line of operations extended from Cologne\r\nand Coblentz on Luxembourg and Namur; Wellington's base was Antwerp,\r\nand his line of operations the short road to Brussels. The sudden attack\r\nby Napoleon on Flanders decided Blücher to receive battle parallel to\r\nthe English base, and not to his own, about which he seemed to have no\r\nuneasiness. This was pardonable, because he could always have a good\r\nchance of regaining Wesel or Nimeguen, and even might seek a refuge in\r\nAntwerp in the last extremity; but if the army had not had its powerful\r\nmaritime allies it would have been destroyed. Beaten at Ligny, and\r\nseeking refuge at Gembloux and then at Wavre, Blücher had but three\r\nstrategic lines to choose from: that which led directly to Maestricht,\r\nthat farther north on Venloo, or the one leading to the English army\r\nnear Mont St. Jean. He audaciously took the last, and triumphed by the\r\napplication of interior strategic lines,--which Napoleon here, perhaps\r\nfor the first time in his life, neglected. It will readily be seen that\r\nthe line followed from Gembloux by Wavre to Mont St. Jean was neither a\r\nline of operations of the Prussian army nor a line of battle, but a\r\n_strategic line of maneuver_, and was interior. It was bold, because he\r\nexposed fully his own natural line of operations. The fact that he\r\nsought a junction with the English made his movement accord with the\r\nprinciples of war.\r\n\r\nA less successful example was that of Ney at Dennewitz. Leaving\r\nWittenberg, and going in the direction of Berlin, he moved to the right\r\nto gain the extreme left of the allies, but in so doing he left his\r\nprimitive line of retreat exposed to the attacks of an enemy superior in\r\nforce. His object was to gain communication with Napoleon, whose\r\nintention was to join him by Herzberg or Luckau; but Ney should from the\r\nbeginning have taken all logistic and tactical means of accomplishing\r\nthis change of strategic line and of informing his army of it. He did\r\nnothing of this kind,--either from forgetfulness, or on account of the\r\nfeeling of aversion he had to any thing like a retreat,--and the severe\r\nlosses at Dennewitz were the result.\r\n\r\nNapoleon in 1796 gave one of the best illustrations of these different\r\ncombinations of strategic lines. His general line of operations extended\r\nfrom the Apennines to Verona. When he had driven Wurmser upon Roveredo\r\nand determined to pursue him into the Tyrol, he pushed on in the valley\r\nof the Adige to Trent and the Lavis, where he learned that Wurmser had\r\nmoved by the Brenta on the Frioul, doubtless to take him in reverse.\r\nThere were but three courses open to him,--to remain in the narrow\r\nvalley of the Adige at great risk, to retreat by Verona to meet Wurmser,\r\nor the last,--which was sublime, but rash,--to follow him into the\r\nvalley of the Brenta, which was encircled by rugged mountains whose two\r\npassages might be held by the Austrians. Napoleon was not the man to\r\nhesitate between three such alternatives. He left Vaubois on the Lavis\r\nto cover Trent, and marched with the remainder of his forces on Bassano.\r\nThe brilliant results of this bold step are well known. The route from\r\nTrent to Bassano was not the line of operations of the army, but a\r\n_strategic line of maneuver_ still bolder than that of Blücher on Wavre.\r\nHowever, it was an operation of only three or four days' duration, at\r\nthe end of which time Napoleon would either beat or be beaten at\r\nBassano: in the first case, he would open direct communication with\r\nVerona and his line of operations; in the second, he could regain in\r\ngreat haste Trent, where, reinforced by Vaubois, he could fall back\r\neither upon Verona or Peschiera. The difficulties of the country, which\r\nmade this march audacious in one respect, were favorable in another; for\r\neven if Wurmser had been victorious at Bassano he could not have\r\ninterfered with the return to Trent, as there was no road to enable him\r\nto anticipate Napoleon. If Davidovitch on the Lavis had driven Vaubois\r\nfrom Trent, he might have embarrassed Napoleon; but this Austrian\r\ngeneral, previously beaten at Roveredo, and ignorant of what the French\r\narmy was doing for several days, and thinking it was all upon him, would\r\nscarcely have thought of resuming the offensive before Napoleon beaten\r\nat Bassano would have been on his retreat. Indeed, if Davidovitch had\r\nadvanced as far as Roveredo, driving Vaubois before him, he would there\r\nhave been surrounded by two French armies, who would have inflicted upon\r\nhim the fate of Vandamme at Culm.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt on this event to show that a proper calculation of time\r\nand distances, joined to great activity, may lead to the success of many\r\nadventures which may seem very imprudent. I conclude from this that it\r\nmay be well sometimes to direct an army upon a route which exposes its\r\nline of operations, but that every measure must be taken to prevent the\r\nenemy from profiting by it, both by great rapidity of execution and by\r\ndemonstrations which will deceive him and leave him in ignorance of what\r\nis taking place. Still, it is a very hazardous maneuver, and only to be\r\nadopted under an urgent necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXIII.\r\n\r\nMeans of protecting a Line of Operations by Temporary Bases or\r\nStrategic Reserves.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a general enters a country offensively, he should form eventual or\r\ntemporary bases,--which, of course, are neither so safe nor so strong as\r\nhis own frontiers. A river with _têtes de ponts_, and one or two large\r\ntowns secure from a _coup de main_ to cover the depots of the army and\r\nto serve as points of assembling for the reserve troops, would be an\r\nexcellent base of this kind. Of course, such a line could not be a\r\ntemporary base if a hostile force were near the line of operations\r\nleading to the real base on the frontiers. Napoleon would have had a\r\ngood real base on the Elbe in 1813 if Austria had remained neutral; but,\r\nshe having joined his enemies, this line was taken in reverse, and\r\nbecame but a pivot of operations, favorable indeed for the execution of\r\na single enterprise, but dangerous for a prolonged occupation,\r\nparticularly in case of a serious reverse. As every army which is beaten\r\nin an enemy's country is exposed to the danger of being cut off from its\r\nown frontiers if it continues to occupy the country, these distant\r\ntemporary bases are rather temporary points of support than real bases,\r\nand are in a measure eventual lines of defense. In general, we cannot\r\nexpect to find in an enemy's country safe positions suitable even for a\r\ntemporary base; and the deficiency must be supplied by a strategic\r\nreserve,--which is purely a modern invention. Its merits and demerits\r\ndeserve notice.\r\n\r\nSTRATEGIC RESERVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nReserves play an important part in modern warfare. From the executive,\r\nwho prepares national reserves, down to the chief of a platoon of\r\nskirmishers, every commander now desires a reserve. A wise government\r\nalways provides good reserves for its armies, and the general uses them\r\nwhen they come under his command. The state has its reserves, the army\r\nhas its own, and every corps d'armée or division should not fail to\r\nprovide one.\r\n\r\nThe reserves of an army are of two kinds,--those on the battle-field,\r\nand those which are intended to recruit and support the army: the\r\nlatter, while organizing, may occupy important points of the theater of\r\nwar, and serve even as strategic reserves; their positions will depend\r\nnot only on their magnitude, but also on the nature of the frontiers and\r\nthe distance from the base to the front of operations. Whenever an army\r\ntakes the offensive, it should always contemplate the possibility of\r\nbeing compelled to act on the defensive, and by the posting of a reserve\r\nbetween the base and front of operations the advantage of an active\r\nreserve on the field of battle is gained: it can fly to the support of\r\nmenaced points without weakening the active army. It is true that to\r\nform a reserve a number of regiments must be withdrawn from active\r\nservice; but there are always reinforcements to arrive, recruits to be\r\ninstructed, and convalescents to be used; and by organizing central\r\ndepots for preparation of munitions and equipments, and by making them\r\nthe rendezvous of all detachments going to and coming from the army, and\r\nadding to them a few good regiments to give tone, a reserve may be\r\nformed capable of important service.\r\n\r\nNapoleon never failed to organize these reserves in his campaigns. Even\r\nin 1797, in his bold march on the Noric Alps, he had first Joubert on\r\nthe Adige, afterward Victor (returning from the Roman States) in the\r\nneighborhood of Verona. In 1805 Ney and Augereau played the part\r\nalternately in the Tyrol and Bavaria, and Mortier and Marmont near\r\nVienna.\r\n\r\nIn 1806 Napoleon formed like reserves on the Rhine, and Mortier used\r\nthem to reduce Hesse. At the same time, other reserves were forming at\r\nMayence under Kellermann, which took post, as fast as organized, between\r\nthe Rhine and Elbe, while Mortier was sent into Pomerania. When Napoleon\r\ndecided to push on to the Vistula in the same year, he directed, with\r\nmuch ostentation, the concentration of an army on the Elbe sixty\r\nthousand strong, its object being to protect Hamburg against the English\r\nand to influence Austria, whose disposition was as manifest as her\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nThe Prussians established a similar reserve in 1806 at Halle, but it was\r\nbadly posted: if it had been established upon the Elbe at Wittenberg or\r\nDessau, and had done its duty, it might have saved the army by giving\r\nPrince Hohenlohe and Blücher time to reach Berlin, or at least Stettin.\r\n\r\nThese reserves are particularly useful when the configuration of the\r\ncountry leads to double fronts of operations: they then fulfill the\r\ndouble object of observing the second front, and, in case of necessity,\r\nof aiding the operations of the main army when the enemy threatens its\r\nflanks or a reverse compels it to fall back toward this reserve.\r\n\r\nOf course, care must be taken not to create dangerous detachments, and\r\nwhenever these reserves can be dispensed with, it should be done, or the\r\ntroops in the depots only be employed as reserves. It is only in distant\r\ninvasions and sometimes on our own soil that they are useful: if the\r\nscene of hostilities be but five or six marches distant from the\r\nfrontier, they are quite superfluous. At home they may generally be\r\ndispensed with: it is only in the case of a serious invasion, when new\r\nlevies are organizing, that such a reserve, in an intrenched camp, under\r\nthe protection of a fortress which serves as a great depot, will be\r\nindispensable.\r\n\r\nThe general's talents will be exercised in judging of the use of these\r\nreserves according to the state of the country, the length of the line\r\nof operations, the nature of the fortified points, and the proximity of\r\na hostile state. He also decides upon their position, and endeavors to\r\nuse for this purpose troops which will not weaken his main army so much\r\nas the withdrawal of his good troops.\r\n\r\nThese reserves ought to hold the most important points between the base\r\nand front of operations, occupy the fortified places if any have been\r\nreduced, observe or invest those which are held by the enemy; and if\r\nthere be no fortress as a point of support, they should throw up\r\nintrenched camps or _têtes de ponts_ to protect the depots and to\r\nincrease the strength of their positions.\r\n\r\nAll that has been said upon pivots of operations is applicable to\r\ntemporary bases and to strategic reserves, which will be doubly valuable\r\nif they possess such well-located pivots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXIV.\r\n\r\nThe Old System of Wars of Position and the Modern System of Marches.\r\n\r\n\r\n_By the system of positions_ is understood the old manner of\r\nconducting a methodical war, with armies in tents, with their supplies\r\nat hand, engaged in watching each other; one besieging a city, the other\r\ncovering it; one, perhaps, endeavoring to acquire a small province, the\r\nother counteracting its efforts by occupying strong points. Such was war\r\nfrom the Middle Ages to the era of the French Revolution. During this\r\nrevolution great changes transpired, and many systems of more or less\r\nvalue sprang up. War was commenced in 1792 as it had been in 1762: the\r\nFrench encamped near their strong places, and the allies besieged them.\r\nIt was not till 1793, when assailed from without and within, that this\r\nsystem was changed. Thoroughly aroused, France threw one million men in\r\nfourteen armies upon her enemies. These armies had neither tents,\r\nprovisions, nor money. On their marches they bivouacked or were\r\nquartered in towns; their mobility was increased and became a means of\r\nsuccess. Their tactics changed also: the troops were put in columns,\r\nwhich were more easily handled than deployed lines, and, on account of\r\nthe broken character of the country of Flanders and the Vosges, they\r\nthrew out a part of their force as skirmishers to protect and cover the\r\ncolumns. This system, which was thus the result of circumstances, at\r\nfirst met with a success beyond all expectation: it disconcerted the\r\nmethodical Austrian and Prussian troops as well as their generals. Mack,\r\nto whom was attributed the success of the Prince of Coburg, increased\r\nhis reputation by directing the troops to extend their lines to oppose\r\nan open order to the fire of skirmishers. It had never occurred to the\r\npoor man that while the skirmishers made the noise the columns carried\r\nthe positions.\r\n\r\nThe first generals of the Republic were fighting-men, and nothing more.\r\nThe principal direction of affairs was in the hands of Carnot and of the\r\nCommittee of Public Safety: it was sometimes judicious, but often bad.\r\nCarnot was the author of one of the finest strategic movements of the\r\nwar. In 1793 he sent a reserve of fine troops successively to the aid of\r\nDunkirk, Maubeuge, and Landau, so that this small force, moving rapidly\r\nfrom point to point, and aided by the troops already collected at these\r\ndifferent points, compelled the enemy to evacuate France.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1794 opened badly. It was the force of circumstances,\r\nand not a premeditated plan, which brought about the strategic movement\r\nof the army of the Moselle on the Sambre; and it was this which led to\r\nthe success of Fleurus and the conquest of Belgium.\r\n\r\nIn 1795 the mistakes of the French were so great that they were imputed\r\nto treachery. The Austrians, on the contrary, were better commanded by\r\nClairfayt, Chateler, and Schmidt than they had been by Mack and the\r\nPrince of Coburg. The Archduke Charles, applying the principle of\r\ninterior lines, triumphed over Moreau and Jourdan in 1796 by a single\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\nUp to this time the fronts of the French armies had been large,--either\r\nto procure subsistence more easily, or because the generals thought it\r\nbetter to put all the divisions in line, leaving it to their commanders\r\nto arrange them for battle. The reserves were small detachments,\r\nincapable of redeeming the day even if the enemy succeeded in\r\noverwhelming but a single division. Such was the state of affairs when\r\nNapoleon made his _début_ in Italy. His activity from the beginning\r\nworsted the Austrians and Piedmontese: free from useless incumbrances,\r\nhis troops surpassed in mobility all modern armies. He conquered the\r\nItalian peninsula by a series of marches and strategic combats. His\r\nmarch on Vienna in 1797 was rash, but justified by the necessity of\r\novercoming the Archduke Charles before he could receive reinforcements\r\nfrom the Rhine.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1800, still more characteristic of the man, marked a new\r\nera in the conception of plans of campaign and lines of operations. He\r\nadopted bold objective points, which looked to nothing less than the\r\ncapture or destruction of whole armies. The orders of battle were less\r\nextended, and the more rational organization of armies in large bodies\r\nof two or three divisions was adopted. The system of modern strategy was\r\nhere fully developed, and the campaigns of 1805 and 1806 were merely\r\ncorollaries to the great problem solved in 1800. Tactically, the system\r\nof columns and skirmishers was too well adapted to the features of Italy\r\nnot to meet with his approval.\r\n\r\nIt may now be a question whether the system of Napoleon is adapted to\r\nall capacities, epochs, and armies, or whether, on the contrary, there\r\ncan be any return, in the light of the events of 1800 and 1809, to the\r\nold system of wars of position. After a comparison of the marches and\r\ncamps of the Seven Years' War with those of the _seven weeks'_ war,--as\r\nNapoleon called the campaign of 1806,--or with those of the three months\r\nwhich elapsed from the departure of the army from Boulogne in 1805 till\r\nits arrival in the plains of Moravia, the reader may easily decide as to\r\nthe relative merits of the two systems.\r\n\r\nThe system of Napoleon was _to march twenty-five miles a day, to fight,\r\nand then to camp in quiet_. He told me that he knew no other method of\r\nconducting a war than this.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that the adventurous character of this great man, his\r\npersonal situation, and the tone of the French mind, all concurred in\r\nurging him to undertakings which no other person, whether born upon a\r\nthrone, or a general under the orders of his government, would ever dare\r\nto adopt. This is probably true; but between the extremes of very\r\ndistant invasions, and wars of position, there is a proper mean, and,\r\nwithout imitating his impetuous audacity, we may pursue the line he has\r\nmarked out. It is probable that the old system of wars of positions will\r\nfor a long time be proscribed, or that, if adopted, it will be much\r\nmodified and improved.\r\n\r\nIf the art of war is enlarged by the adoption of the system of marches,\r\nhumanity, on the contrary, loses by it; for these rapid incursions and\r\nbivouacs of considerable masses, feeding upon the regions they overrun,\r\nare not materially different from the devastations of the barbarian\r\nhordes between the fourth and thirteenth centuries. Still, it is not\r\nlikely that the system will be speedily renounced; for a great truth has\r\nbeen demonstrated by Napoleon's wars,--viz.: that remoteness is not a\r\ncertain safeguard against invasion,--that a state to be secure must have\r\na good system of fortresses and lines of defense, of reserves and\r\nmilitary institutions, and, finally, a good system of government. Then\r\nthe people may everywhere be organized as militia, and may serve as\r\nreserves to the active armies, which will render the latter more\r\nformidable; and the greater the strength of the armies the more\r\nnecessary is the system of rapid operations and prompt results.\r\n\r\nIf, in time, social order assumes a calmer state,--if nations, instead\r\nof fighting for their existence, fight only for their interests, to\r\nacquire a natural frontier or to maintain the political\r\nequilibrium,--then a new right of nations may be agreed upon, and\r\nperhaps it will be possible to have armies on a less extensive scale.\r\nThen also we may see armies of from eighty to one hundred thousand men\r\nreturn to a mixed system of war,--a mean between the rapid incursions of\r\nNapoleon and the slow system of positions of the last century. Until\r\nthen we must expect to retain this system of marches, which has produced\r\nso great results; for the first to renounce it in the presence of an\r\nactive and capable enemy would probably be a victim to his indiscretion.\r\n\r\nThe science of marches now includes more than details, like the\r\nfollowing, viz.: the order of the different arms in column, the time of\r\ndeparture and arrival, the precautions to be observed in the march, and\r\nthe means of communication between the columns, all of which is a part\r\nof the duties of the staff of an army. Outside and beyond these very\r\nimportant details, there is a science of marches in the great operations\r\nof strategy. For instance, the march of Napoleon by the Saint-Bernard\r\nto fall upon the communications of Mélas, those made in 1805 by\r\nDonauwerth to cut off Mack, and in 1806 by Gera to turn the Prussians,\r\nthe march of Suwaroff from Turin to the Trebbia to meet Macdonald, that\r\nof the Russian army on Taroutin, then upon Krasnoi, were decisive\r\noperations, not because of their relation to Logistics, but on account\r\nof their strategic relations.\r\n\r\nIndeed, these skillful marches are but applications of the great\r\nprinciple of throwing the mass of the forces upon the decisive point;\r\nand this point is to be determined from the considerations given in\r\nArticle XIX. What was the passage of the Saint-Bernard but a line of\r\noperations directed against an extremity of the strategic front of the\r\nenemy, and thence upon his line of retreat? The marches of Ulm and Jena\r\nwere the same maneuvers; and what was Blücher's march at Waterloo but an\r\napplication of interior strategic lines?\r\n\r\nFrom this it may be concluded that all strategic movements which tend to\r\nthrow the mass of the army successively upon the different points of the\r\nfront of operations of the enemy, will be skillful, as they apply the\r\nprinciple of overwhelming a smaller force by a superior one. The\r\noperations of the French in 1793 from Dunkirk to Landau, and those of\r\nNapoleon in 1796, 1809, and 1814, are models of this kind.\r\n\r\nOne of the most essential points in the science of modern marches, is to\r\nso combine the movements of the columns as to cover the greatest\r\nstrategic front, when beyond the reach of the enemy, for the triple\r\nobject of deceiving him as to the objective in view, of moving with ease\r\nand rapidity, and of procuring supplies with more facility. However, it\r\nis necessary in this case to have previously arranged the means of\r\nconcentration of the columns in order to inflict a decisive blow.\r\n\r\nThis alternate application of extended and concentric movements is the\r\ntrue test of a great general.\r\n\r\nThere is another kind of marches, designated as _flank marches_, which\r\ndeserves notice. They have always been held up as very dangerous; but\r\nnothing satisfactory has ever been written about them. If by the term\r\n_flank marches_ are understood tactical maneuvers made upon the field of\r\nbattle in view of the enemy, it is certain that they are very delicate\r\noperations, though sometimes successful; but if reference is made to\r\nordinary strategic marches, I see nothing particularly dangerous in\r\nthem, unless the most common precautions of Logistics be neglected. In a\r\nstrategic movement, the two hostile armies ought to be separated by\r\nabout two marches, (counting the distance which separates the advanced\r\nguards from the enemy and from their own columns.) In such a case there\r\ncould be no danger in a strategic march from one point to another.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, two cases where such a march would be altogether\r\ninadmissible: the first is where the system of the line of operations,\r\nof the strategic lines, and of the front of operations is so chosen as\r\nto present the flank to the enemy during a whole operation. This was the\r\nfamous project of marching upon Leipsic, leaving Napoleon and Dresden on\r\nthe flank, which would, if carried out, have proved fatal to the allies.\r\nIt was modified by the Emperor Alexander upon the solicitations of the\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nThe second case is where the line of operations is very long, (as was\r\nthe case with Napoleon at Borodino,) and particularly if this line\r\naffords but a single suitable route for retreat: then every flank\r\nmovement exposing this line would be a great fault.\r\n\r\nIn countries abounding in secondary communications, flank movements are\r\nstill less dangerous, since, if repulsed, safety may be found in a\r\nchange of the line of operations. The physical and moral condition of\r\nthe troops and the more or less energetic characters of the commanders\r\nwill, of course, be elements in the determination of such movements.\r\n\r\nThe often-quoted marches of Jena and Ulm were actual flank maneuvers; so\r\nwas that upon Milan after the passage of the Chiusella, and that of\r\nMarshal Paskevitch to cross the Vistula at Ossiek; and their successful\r\nissue is well known.\r\n\r\nA tactical maneuver by the flank in the presence of the enemy is quite a\r\ndifferent affair. Ney suffered for a movement of this kind at Dennewitz,\r\nand so did Marmont at Salamanca and Frederick at Kolin.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the celebrated maneuver of Frederick at Leuthen was a\r\ntrue flank movement, but it was covered by a mass of cavalry concealed\r\nby the heights, and applied against an army which lay motionless in its\r\ncamp; and it was so successful because at the time of the decisive shock\r\nDaun was taken in flank, and not Frederick.\r\n\r\nIn the old system of marching in column at platoon distance, where line\r\nof battle could be formed to the right or left without deployment, (by a\r\nright or left into line,) movements parallel to the enemy's line were\r\nnot _flank marches_, because the flank of the column was the real front\r\nof the line of battle.\r\n\r\nThe famous march of Eugene within view of the French army, to turn the\r\nlines of Turin, was still more extraordinary than that of Leuthen, and\r\nno less successful.\r\n\r\nIn these different battles, the maneuvers were tactical and not\r\nstrategic. The march of Eugene from Mantua to Turin was one of the\r\ngreatest strategic operations of the age; but the case above referred to\r\nwas a movement made to turn the French camp the evening before the\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXV.\r\n\r\nDepots of Supplies, and their Relation to Marches.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject most nearly connected with the system of marches is the\r\ncommissariat, for to march quickly and for a long distance food must be\r\nsupplied; and the problem of supporting a numerous army in an enemy's\r\ncountry is a very difficult one. It is proposed to discuss the relation\r\nbetween the commissariat and strategy.\r\n\r\nIt will always be difficult to imagine how Darius and Xerxes subsisted\r\ntheir immense armies in Thrace, where now it would be a hard task to\r\nsupply thirty thousand men. During the Middle Ages, the Greeks,\r\nbarbarians, and more lately the Crusaders, maintained considerable\r\nbodies of men in that country. Cæsar said that war should support war,\r\nand he is generally believed to have lived at the expense of the\r\ncountries he overran.\r\n\r\nThe Middle Ages were remarkable for the great migrations of all kinds,\r\nand it would be interesting to know the numbers of the Huns, Vandals,\r\nGoths, and Mongols who successively traversed Europe, and how they lived\r\nduring their marches. The commissariat arrangements of the Crusaders\r\nwould also be an interesting subject of research.\r\n\r\nIn the early periods of modern history, it is probable that the armies\r\nof Francis I., in crossing the Alps into Italy, did not carry with them\r\nlarge stores of provisions; for armies of their magnitude, of forty or\r\nfifty thousand men, could easily find provisions in the rich valleys of\r\nthe Ticino and Po.\r\n\r\nUnder Louis XIV. and Frederick II. the armies were larger; they fought\r\non their own frontiers, and lived from their storehouses, which were\r\nestablished as they moved. This interfered greatly with operations,\r\nrestricting the troops within a distance from the depots dependent upon\r\nthe means of transportation, the rations they could carry, and the\r\nnumber of days necessary for wagons to go to the depots and return to\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolution, depots of supply were abandoned from necessity.\r\nThe large armies which invaded Belgium and Germany lived sometimes in\r\nthe houses of the people, sometimes by requisitions laid upon the\r\ncountry, and often by plunder and pillage. To subsist an army on the\r\ngranaries of Belgium, Italy, Swabia, and the rich banks of the Rhine and\r\nDanube, is easy,--particularly if it marches in a number of columns and\r\ndoes not exceed one hundred or one hundred and twenty thousand men; but\r\nthis would be very difficult in some other countries, and quite\r\nimpossible in Russia, Sweden, Poland, and Turkey. It may readily be\r\nconceived how great may be the rapidity and impetuosity of an army where\r\nevery thing depends only on the strength of the soldiers' legs. This\r\nsystem gave Napoleon great advantages; but he abused it by applying it\r\non too large a scale and to countries where it was impracticable.\r\n\r\nA general should be capable of making all the resources of the invaded\r\ncountry contribute to the success of his enterprises: he should use the\r\nlocal authorities, if they remain, to regulate the assessments so as to\r\nmake them uniform and legal, while he himself should see to their\r\nfulfillment. If the authorities do not remain, he should create\r\nprovisional ones of the leading men, and endow them with extraordinary\r\npowers. The provisions thus acquired should be collected at the points\r\nmost convenient for the operations of the army. In order to husband\r\nthem, the troops may be quartered in the towns and villages, taking care\r\nto reimburse the inhabitants for the extra charge thus laid upon them.\r\nThe inhabitants should also be required to furnish wagons to convey the\r\nsupplies to the points occupied by the troops.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to designate precisely what it will be prudent to\r\nundertake without having previously established these depots, as much\r\ndepends upon the season, country, strength of the armies, and spirit of\r\nthe people; but the following may be considered as general maxims:--\r\n\r\n1. That in fertile and populous regions not hostile, an army of one\r\nhundred to one hundred and twenty thousand men, when so far distant from\r\nthe enemy as to be able safely to recover a considerable extent of\r\ncountry, may draw its resources from it, during the time occupied by any\r\nsingle operation.\r\n\r\nAs the first operation never requires more than a month, during which\r\ntime the great body of the troops will be in motion, it will be\r\nsufficient to provide, by depots of provisions, for the eventual wants\r\nof the army, and particularly for those of the troops obliged to remain\r\nat a particular point. Thus, the army of Napoleon, while half of it was\r\nbesieging Ulm, would need bread until the surrender of the city; and if\r\nthere had been a scarcity the operation might have failed.\r\n\r\n2. During this time every effort should be made to collect the supplies\r\nobtained in the country, and to form depots, in order to subserve the\r\nwants of the army after the success of the operation, whether it take a\r\nposition to recruit or whether it undertake a new enterprise.\r\n\r\n3. The depots formed either by purchase or forced requisitions should be\r\necheloned as much as possible upon three different lines of\r\ncommunication, in order to supply with more facility the wings of the\r\narmy, and to extend as much as possible the area from which successive\r\nsupplies are to be drawn, and, lastly, in order that the depots should\r\nbe as well covered as possible. To this end, it would be well to have\r\nthe depots on lines converging toward the principal line of operations,\r\nwhich will be generally found in the center. This arrangement has two\r\nreal advantages: first, the depots are less exposed to the attempts of\r\nthe enemy, as his distance from them is thereby increased; secondly, it\r\nfacilitates the movements of the army in concentrating upon a single\r\npoint of the line of operations to the rear, with a view of retaking the\r\ninitiative from the enemy, who may have temporarily assumed the\r\noffensive and gained some advantage.\r\n\r\n4. In thinly-settled and unproductive regions the army will lack its\r\nmost necessary supplies: it will be prudent, in this case, not to\r\nadvance too far from its depots, and to carry with it sufficient\r\nprovisions to enable it, if compelled to do so, to fall back upon its\r\nlines of depots.\r\n\r\n5. In national wars where the inhabitants fly and destroy every thing in\r\ntheir path, as was the case in Spain, Portugal, Russia, and Turkey, it\r\nis impossible to advance unless attended by trains of provisions and\r\nwithout having a sure base of supply near the front of operations. Under\r\nthese circumstances a war of invasion becomes very difficult, if not\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n6. It is not only necessary to collect large quantities of supplies, but\r\nit is indispensable to have the means of conveying them with or after\r\nthe army; and this is the greatest difficulty, particularly on rapid\r\nexpeditions. To facilitate their transportation, the rations should\r\nconsist of the most portable articles,--as biscuit, rice, &c.: the\r\nwagons should be both light and strong, so as to pass over all kinds of\r\nroads. It will be necessary to collect all the vehicles of the country,\r\nand to insure good treatment to their owners or drivers; and these\r\nvehicles should be arranged in parks at different points, so as not to\r\ntake the drivers too far from their homes and in order to husband the\r\nsuccessive resources. Lastly, the soldier must he habituated to carry\r\nwith him several days' rations of bread, rice, or even of flour.\r\n\r\n7. The vicinity of the sea is invaluable for the transportation of\r\nsupplies; and the party which is master on this element can supply\r\nhimself at will. This advantage, however, is not absolute in the case of\r\na large continental army; for, in the desire to maintain communications\r\nwith its depots, it may be drawn into operations on the coast, thus\r\nexposing itself to the greatest risks if the enemy maneuver with the\r\nmass of his forces upon the extremity opposite the sea. If the army\r\nadvance too far from the coast, there will be danger of its\r\ncommunications being intercepted; and this danger increases with the\r\nprogress of the army.\r\n\r\n8. A continental army using the sea for transportation should base\r\nitself on the land, and have a reserve of provisions independent of its\r\nships, and a line of retreat prepared on the extremity of its strategic\r\nfront opposed to the sea.\r\n\r\n9. Navigable streams and canals, when parallel to the line of operations\r\nof the army, render the transportation of supplies much easier, and also\r\nfree the roads from the incumbrances of the numerous vehicles otherwise\r\nnecessary. For this reason, lines of operations thus situated are the\r\nmost favorable. The water-communications themselves are not in this case\r\nthe lines of operations, as has been asserted: on the contrary, it is\r\nessential that the troops should be able to move at some distance from\r\nthe river, in order to prevent the enemy from throwing back the exterior\r\nflank upon the river,--which might be as dangerous as if it were the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nIn the enemy's country the rivers can scarcely ever be used for\r\ntransportation, since the boats will probably be destroyed, and since a\r\nsmall body of men may easily embarrass the navigation. To render it\r\nsure, it is necessary to occupy both banks,--which is hazardous, as\r\nMortier experienced at Dirnstein. In a friendly country the advantages\r\nof rivers are more substantial.\r\n\r\n10. In default of bread or biscuit, the pressing wants of an army may be\r\nfed by cattle on the hoof; and these can generally be found, in populous\r\ncountries, in numbers to last for some little time. This source of\r\nsupply will, however, be soon exhausted; and, in addition, this plan\r\nleads to plunder. The requisitions for cattle should be well regulated;\r\nand the best plan of all is to supply the army with cattle purchased\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nI will end this article by recording a remark of Napoleon which may\r\nappear whimsical, but which is still not without reason. He said that in\r\nhis first campaigns the enemy was so well provided that when his troops\r\nwere in want of supplies he had only to fall upon the rear of the enemy\r\nto procure every thing in abundance. This is a remark upon which it\r\nwould be absurd to found a system, but which perhaps explains the\r\nsuccess of many a rash enterprise, and proves how much actual war\r\ndiffers from narrow theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXVI.\r\n\r\nThe Defense of Frontiers by Forts and Intrenched Lines.--Wars of\r\nSieges.\r\n\r\n\r\nForts serve two principal purposes: first, to cover the frontiers;\r\nsecondly, to aid the operations of the campaign.\r\n\r\nThe defense of frontiers is a problem generally somewhat indeterminate.\r\nIt is not so for those countries whose borders are covered with great\r\nnatural obstacles, and which present but few accessible points, and\r\nthese admitting of defense by the art of the engineer. The problem here\r\nis simple; but in open countries it is more difficult. The Alps and the\r\nPyrenees, and the lesser ranges of the Crapacks, of Riesengebirge, of\r\nErzgebirge, of the Böhmerwald, of the Black Forest, of the Vosges, and\r\nof the Jura, are not so formidable that they cannot be made more so by a\r\ngood system of fortresses.\r\n\r\nOf all these frontiers, that separating France and Piedmont was best\r\ncovered. The valleys of the Stura and Suza, the passes of Argentine, of\r\nMont-Genèvre, and of Mont-Cenis,--the only ones considered\r\npracticable,--were covered by masonry forts; and, in addition, works of\r\nconsiderable magnitude guarded the issues of the valleys in the plains\r\nof Piedmont. It was certainly no easy matter to surmount these\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nThese excellent artificial defenses will not always prevent the passage\r\nof an army, because the small works which are found in the gorges may be\r\ncarried, or the enemy, if he be bold, may find a passage over some other\r\nroute hitherto deemed impracticable. The passage of the Alps by Francis\r\nI.,--which is so well described by Gaillard,--Napoleon's passage of the\r\nSaint-Bernard, and the Splugen expedition, prove that there is truth in\r\nthe remark of Napoleon, _that an army can pass wherever a titan can set\r\nhis foot_,--a maxim not strictly true, but characteristic of the man,\r\nand applied by him with great success.\r\n\r\nOther countries are covered by large rivers, either as a first line or\r\nas a second. It is, however, remarkable that such lines, apparently so\r\nwell calculated to separate nations without interfering with trade and\r\ncommunication, are generally not part of the real frontier. It cannot be\r\nsaid that the Danube divides Bessarabia from the Ottoman empire as long\r\nas the Turks have a foothold in Moldavia. The Rhine was never the real\r\nfrontier of France and Germany; for the French for long periods held\r\npoints upon the right bank, while the Germans were in possession of\r\nMayence, Luxembourg, and the _têtes de ponts_ of Manheim and Wesel on\r\nthe left bank.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the Danube, the Rhine, Rhone, Elbe, Oder, Vistula, Po, and\r\nAdige be not exterior lines of the frontier, there is no reason why they\r\nshould not be fortified as lines of permanent defense, wherever they\r\npermit the use of a system suitable for covering a front of operations.\r\n\r\nAn example of this kind is the Inn, which separates Bavaria from\r\nAustria: flanked on the south by the Tyrolese Alps, on the north by\r\nBohemia and the Danube, its narrow front is covered by the three\r\nfortified places of Passau, Braunau, and Salzburg. Lloyd, with some\r\npoetic license, compares this frontier to two impregnable bastions whose\r\ncurtain is formed of three fine forts and whose ditch is one of the most\r\nrapid of rivers. He has exaggerated these advantages; for his epithet of\r\n\"impregnable\" was decidedly disproved by the bloody events of 1800,\r\n1805, and 1809.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the European states have frontiers by no means so\r\nformidable as that of the Alps and the Inn, being generally open, or\r\nconsisting of mountains with practicable passes at a considerable number\r\nof points. We propose to give a set of general maxims equally\r\napplicable to all cases.\r\n\r\nWhen the topography of a frontier is open, there should be no attempt to\r\nmake a complete line of defense by building too many fortresses,\r\nrequiring armies to garrison them, and which, after all, might not\r\nprevent an enemy from penetrating the country. It is much wiser to build\r\nfewer works, and to have them properly located, not with the expectation\r\nof absolutely preventing the ingress of the enemy, but to multiply the\r\nimpediments to his progress, and, at the same time, to support the\r\nmovements of the army which is to repel him.\r\n\r\nIf it be rare that a fortified place of itself absolutely prevents the\r\nprogress of an army, it is, nevertheless, an embarrassment, and compels\r\nthe army to detach a part of its force or to make _détours_ in its\r\nmarch; while, on the other hand, it imparts corresponding advantages to\r\nthe army which holds it, covers his depots, flanks, and movements, and,\r\nfinally, is a place of refuge in case of need.\r\n\r\nFortresses thus exercise a manifest influence over military operations;\r\nand we now propose to examine their relations to strategy.\r\n\r\nThe first point to be considered is their location; the second lies in\r\nthe distinction between the cases where an army can afford to pass the\r\nforts without a siege, and those where it will be necessary to besiege;\r\nthe third point is in reference to the relations of an army to a siege\r\nwhich it proposes to cover.\r\n\r\nAs fortresses properly located favor military operations, in the same\r\ndegree those which are unfortunately placed are disadvantageous. They\r\nare an incubus upon the army which is compelled to garrison them and the\r\nstate whose men and money are wasted upon them. There are many in Europe\r\nin this category. It is bad policy to cover a frontier with fortresses\r\nvery close together. This system has been wrongly imputed to Vauban,\r\nwho, on the contrary, had a controversy with Louvois about the great\r\nnumber of points the latter desired to fortify. The maxims on this point\r\nare as follow:--\r\n\r\n1. The fortified places should be in echelon, on three lines, and\r\nshould extend from the frontiers toward the capital.[20] There should be\r\nthree in the first line, as many in the second, and a large place in the\r\nthird, near the center of the state. If there be four fronts, this would\r\nrequire, for a complete system, from twenty-four to thirty places.\r\n\r\nIt will be objected that this number is large, and that even Austria has\r\nnot so many. It must be recollected that France has more than forty upon\r\nonly a third of its frontiers, (from Besançon to Dunkirk,) and still has\r\nnot enough on the third line in the center of the country. A Board\r\nconvened for the purpose of considering the system of fortresses has\r\ndecided quite recently that more were required. This does not prove that\r\nthere were not already too many, but that certain points in addition\r\nshould be fortified, while those on the first line, although too much\r\ncrowded, may be maintained since they are already in existence.\r\nAdmitting that France has two fronts from Dunkirk to Basel, one from\r\nBasel to Savoy, one from Savoy to Nice, in addition to the totally\r\ndistinct line of the Pyrenees and the coast-line, there are six fronts,\r\nrequiring forty to fifty places. Every military man will admit that this\r\nis enough, since the Swiss and coast fronts require fewer than the\r\nnortheast. The system of arrangement of these fortresses is an important\r\nelement of their usefulness. Austria has a less number, because she is\r\nbordered by the small German states, which, instead of being hostile,\r\nplace their own forts at her disposal. Moreover, the number above given\r\nis what was considered necessary for a state having four fronts of\r\nnearly equal development. Prussia, being long and narrow, and extending\r\nfrom Königsberg almost to the gates of Metz, should not be fortified\r\nupon the same system as France, Spain, or Austria. Thus the geographical\r\nposition and extent of states may either diminish or increase the number\r\nof fortresses, particularly when maritime forts are to be included.\r\n\r\n2. Fortresses should always occupy the important strategic points\r\nalready designated in Article XIX. As to their tactical qualities, their\r\nsites should not be commanded, and egress from them should be easy, in\r\norder to increase the difficulty of blockading them.\r\n\r\n3. Those which possess the greatest advantages, either as to their own\r\ndefense or for seconding the operations of an army, are certainly those\r\nsituated on great rivers and commanding both banks. Mayence, Coblentz,\r\nand Strasbourg, including Kehl, are true illustrations and models of\r\nthis kind. Places situated at the confluence of two great rivers command\r\nthree different fronts, and hence are of increased importance. Take, for\r\ninstance, Modlin. Mayence, when it had on the left bank of the Main the\r\nfort of Gustavusburg, and Cassel on the right, was the most formidable\r\nplace in Europe, but it required a garrison of twenty-five thousand men:\r\nso that works of this extent must be few in number.\r\n\r\n4. Large forts, when encompassing populous and commercial cities, are\r\npreferable to small ones,--particularly when the assistance of the\r\ncitizens can be relied on for their defense. Metz arrested the whole\r\npower of Charles V, and Lille for a whole year delayed Eugene and\r\nMarlborough. Strasbourg has many times proved the security of French\r\narmies. During the last wars these places were passed without being\r\nbesieged by the invading forces, because all Europe was in arms against\r\nFrance; but one hundred and fifty thousand Germans having in their front\r\none hundred thousand French could not penetrate to the Seine with\r\nimpunity, leaving behind them these well-fortified points.\r\n\r\n5. Formerly the operations of war were directed against towns, camps,\r\nand positions; recently they have been directed only against organized\r\narmies, leaving out of consideration all natural or artificial\r\nobstacles. The exclusive use of either of these systems is faulty: the\r\ntrue course is a mean between these extremes. Doubtless, it will always\r\nbe of the first importance to destroy and disorganize all the armies of\r\nthe enemy in the field, and to attain this end it may be allowable to\r\npass the fortresses; but if the success be only partial it will be\r\nunwise to push the invasion too far. Here, also, very much depends upon\r\nthe situation and respective strength of the armies and the spirit of\r\nthe nations.\r\n\r\nIf Austria were the sole antagonist of France, she could not follow in\r\nthe footsteps of the allies in 1814; neither is it probable that fifty\r\nthousand French will very soon risk themselves beyond the Noric Alps, in\r\nthe very heart of Austria, as Napoleon did in 1797.[21] Such events only\r\noccur under exceptional circumstances.\r\n\r\n6. It may be concluded from what precedes,--1st, that, while fortified\r\nplaces are essential supports, abuse in their application may, by\r\ndividing an army, weaken it instead of adding to its efficiency; 2d,\r\nthat an army may, with the view of destroying the enemy, pass the line\r\nof these forts,--always, however, leaving a force to observe them; 3d,\r\nthat an army cannot pass a large river, like the Danube or the Rhine,\r\nwithout reducing at least one of the fortresses on the river, in order\r\nto secure a good line of retreat. Once master of this place, the army\r\nmay advance on the offensive, leaving detachments to besiege other\r\nplaces; and the chances of the reduction of those places increase as the\r\narmy advances, since the enemy's opportunities of hindering the siege\r\nare correspondingly diminished.\r\n\r\n7. While large places are much the most advantageous among a friendly\r\npeople, smaller works are not without importance, not to arrest an\r\nenemy, who might mask them, but as they may materially aid the\r\noperations of an army in the field. The fort of Königstein in 1813 was\r\nas useful to the French as the fortress of Dresden, because it procured\r\na _tête de pont_ on the Elbe.\r\n\r\nIn a mountainous country, small, well-located forts are equal in value\r\nto fortified places, because their province is to close the passes, and\r\nnot to afford refuge to armies: the little fort of Bard, in the valley\r\nof Aosta, almost arrested Napoleon's army in 1800.\r\n\r\n8. It follows that each frontier should have one or two large fortresses\r\nas places of refuge, besides secondary forts and small posts to\r\nfacilitate military operations. Walled cities with a shallow ditch may\r\nbe very useful in the interior of a country, to contain depots,\r\nhospitals, &c, when they are strong enough to resist the attacks of any\r\nsmall bodies that may traverse the vicinity. They will be particularly\r\nserviceable if they can be defended by the militia, so as not to weaken\r\nthe active army.\r\n\r\n9. Large fortified places which are not in proper strategic positions\r\nare a positive misfortune for both the army and state.\r\n\r\n10. Those on the sea-coast are of importance only in a maritime war,\r\nexcept for depots: they may even prove disastrous for a continental\r\narmy, by holding out to it a delusive promise of support. Benningsen\r\nalmost lost the Russian armies by basing them in 1807 on\r\nKönigsberg,--which he did because it was convenient for supply. If the\r\nRussian army in 1812, instead of concentrating on Smolensk, had\r\nsupported itself on Dunaburg and Riga, it would have been in danger of\r\nbeing forced into the sea and of being cut off from all its bases.\r\n\r\nThe relations between sieges and the operations of active armies are of\r\ntwo kinds. An invading army may pass by fortified places without\r\nattacking them, but it must leave a force to invest them, or at least to\r\nwatch them; and when there are a number of them adjacent to each other\r\nit will be necessary to leave an entire corps d'armée, under a single\r\ncommander, to invest or watch them as circumstances may require. When\r\nthe invading army decides to attack a place, a sufficient force to carry\r\non the siege will be assigned to this duty; the remainder may either\r\ncontinue its march or take a position to cover the siege.\r\n\r\nFormerly the false system prevailed of encircling a city by a whole\r\narmy, which buried itself in lines of circumvallation and\r\ncontravallation. These lines cost as much in labor and expense as the\r\nsiege itself. The famous case of the lines of Turin, which were fifteen\r\nmiles in length, and, though guarded by seventy-eight thousand French,\r\nwere forced by Prince Eugene with forty thousand men in 1706, is enough\r\nto condemn this ridiculous system.\r\n\r\nMuch as the recital of the immense labors of Cæsar in the investment of\r\nAlise may excite our admiration, it is not probable that any general in\r\nour times will imitate his example. Nevertheless, it is very necessary\r\nfor the investing force to strengthen its position by detached works\r\ncommanding the routes by which the garrison might issue or by which the\r\nsiege might be disturbed from without. This was done by Napoleon at\r\nMantua, and by the Russians at Varna.\r\n\r\nExperience has proved that the best way to cover a siege is to beat and\r\npursue as far as possible the enemy's forces which could interfere. If\r\nthe besieging force is numerically inferior, it should take up a\r\nstrategic position covering all the avenues by which succor might\r\narrive; and when it approaches, as much of the besieging force as can be\r\nspared should unite with the covering force to fall upon the approaching\r\narmy and decide whether the siege shall continue or not.\r\n\r\nBonaparte in 1796, at Mantua, was a model of wisdom and skill for the\r\noperations of an army of observation.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRENCHED LINES.\r\n\r\nBesides the lines of circumvallation and contravallation referred to\r\nabove, there is another kind, which is more extended than they are, and\r\nis in a measure allied to permanent fortifications, because it is\r\nintended to protect a part of the frontiers.\r\n\r\nAs a fortress or an intrenched camp may, as a temporary refuge for an\r\narmy, be highly advantageous, so to the same degree is the system of\r\nintrenched lines absurd. I do not now refer to lines of small extent\r\nclosing a narrow gorge, like Fussen and Scharnitz, for they may be\r\nregarded as forts; but I speak of extended lines many leagues in length\r\nand intended to wholly close a part of the frontiers. For instance,\r\nthose of Wissembourg, which, covered by the Lauter flowing in front,\r\nsupported by the Rhine on the right and the Vosges on the left, seemed\r\nto fulfill all the conditions of safety; and yet they were forced on\r\nevery occasion when they were assailed.\r\n\r\nThe lines of Stollhofen, which on the right of the Rhine played the same\r\npart as those of Wissembourg on the left, were equally unfortunate; and\r\nthose of the Queich and the Kinzig had the same fate.\r\n\r\nThe lines of Turin, (1706,) and those of Mayence, (1795,) although\r\nintended as lines of circumvallation, were analogous to the lines in\r\nquestion in their extent and in the fate which befell them. However well\r\nthey may be supported by natural obstacles, their great extent paralyzes\r\ntheir defenders, and they are almost always susceptible of being turned.\r\nTo bury an army in intrenchments, where it may be outflanked and\r\nsurrounded, or forced in front even if secure from a flank attack, is\r\nmanifest folly; and it is to be hoped that we shall never see another\r\ninstance of it. Nevertheless, in our chapter on Tactics we will treat of\r\ntheir attack and defense.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to remark that, while it is absurd to use these extended\r\nlines, it would be equally foolish to neglect the advantages to be\r\nderived from detached works in increasing the strength of a besieging\r\nforce, the safety of a position, or the defense of a defile.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: The memorable campaign of 1829 is evidence of the value of\r\nsuch a system. If the Porte had possessed masonry forts in the defiles\r\nof the Balkan and a good fortress toward Faki, the Russians would not\r\nhave reached Adrianople, and the affair would not have been so simple.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Still, Napoleon was right in taking the offensive in the\r\nFrioul, since the Austrians were expecting a reinforcement from the\r\nRhine of twenty thousand men, and of course it was highly important to\r\nbeat the Archduke Charles before this force joined him. In view of the\r\ncircumstances of the case, Napoleon's conduct was in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of war.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXVII.\r\n\r\nThe Connection of Intrenched Camps and Têtes de Ponts with Strategy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be out of place here to go into details as to the sites of\r\nordinary camps and upon the means of covering them by advanced guards,\r\nor upon the advantages of field-fortifications in the defense of posts.\r\nOnly fortified camps enter into the combinations of grand tactics, and\r\neven of strategy; and this they do by the temporary support they afford\r\nan army.\r\n\r\nIt may be seen by the example of the camp of Buntzelwitz, which saved\r\nFrederick in 1761, and by those of Kehl and Dusseldorf in 1796, that\r\nsuch a refuge may prove of the greatest importance. The camp of Ulm, in\r\n1800, enabled Kray to arrest for a whole month the army of Moreau on\r\nthe Danube; and Wellington derived great advantages from his camp of\r\nTorres-Vedras. The Turks were greatly assisted in defending the country\r\nbetween the Danube and the Balkan Mountains by the camp of Shumla.\r\n\r\nThe principal rule in this connection is that camps should be\r\nestablished on strategic points which should also possess tactical\r\nadvantages. If the camp of Drissa was useless to the Russians in 1812,\r\nit was because it was not in a proper position in reference to their\r\ndefensive system, which should have rested upon Smolensk and Moscow.\r\nHence the Russians were compelled to abandon it after a few days.\r\n\r\nThe maxims which have been given for the determination of the great\r\ndecisive strategic points will apply to all intrenched camps, because\r\nthey ought only to be placed on such points. The influence of these\r\ncamps is variable: they may answer equally well as points of departure\r\nfor an offensive operation, as _têtes de ponts_ to assure the crossing\r\nof a large river, as protection for winter quarters, or as a refuge for\r\na defeated army.\r\n\r\nHowever good may be the site of such a camp, it will always be difficult\r\nto locate it so that it may not be turned, unless, like the camp of\r\nTorres-Vedras, it be upon a peninsula backed by the sea. Whenever it can\r\nbe passed either by the right or the left, the army will be compelled to\r\nabandon it or run the risk of being invested in it. The camp of Dresden\r\nwas an important support to Napoleon for two months; but as soon as it\r\nwas outflanked by the allies it had not the advantages even of an\r\nordinary fortress; for its extent led to the sacrifice of two corps\r\nwithin a few days for want of provisions.\r\n\r\nDespite all this, these camps, when only intended to afford temporary\r\nsupport to an army on the defensive, may still fulfill this end, even\r\nwhen the enemy passes by them, provided they cannot be taken in\r\nreverse,--that is, provided all their faces are equally safe from a\r\n_coup de main_. It is also important that they be established close to a\r\nfortress, where the depots may be safe, or which may cover the front of\r\nthe camp nearest to the line of retreat.\r\n\r\nIn general terms, such a camp on a river, with a large _tête de pont_\r\non the other side to command both banks, and near a large fortified city\r\nlike Mayence or Strasbourg, is of undoubted advantage; but it will never\r\nbe more than a temporary refuge, a means of gaining time and of\r\ncollecting reinforcements. When the object is to drive away the enemy,\r\nit will be necessary to leave the camp and carry on operations in the\r\nopen country.\r\n\r\nThe second maxim as to these camps is, that they are particularly\r\nadvantageous to an army at home or near its base of operations. If a\r\nFrench army occupied an intrenched camp on the Elbe, it would be lost\r\nwhen the space between the Rhine and Elbe was held by the enemy; but if\r\nit were invested in an intrenched camp near Strasbourg, it might with a\r\nlittle assistance resume its superiority and take the field, while the\r\nenemy in the interior of France and between the relieving force and the\r\nintrenched army would have great difficulty in recrossing the Rhine.\r\n\r\nWe have heretofore considered these camps in a strategic light; but\r\nseveral German generals have maintained that they are suitable to cover\r\nplaces or to prevent sieges,--which appears to me to be a little\r\nsophistical. Doubtless, it will be more difficult to besiege a place\r\nwhen an army is encamped on its glacis; and it maybe said that the forts\r\nand camps are a mutual support; but, according to my view, the real and\r\nprincipal use of intrenched camps is always to afford, if necessary, a\r\ntemporary refuge for an army, or the means of debouching offensively\r\nupon a decisive point or beyond a large river. To bury an army in such a\r\ncamp, to expose it to the danger of being outflanked and cut off, simply\r\nto retard a siege, would be folly. The example of Wurmser, who prolonged\r\nthe defense of Mantua, will be cited in opposition to this; but did not\r\nhis army perish? And was this sacrifice really useful? I do not think\r\nso; for, the place having been once relieved and revictualed, and the\r\nsiege-train having fallen into the hands of the Austrians, the siege was\r\nnecessarily changed into a blockade, and the town could only be taken by\r\nreason of famine; and, this being the case, Wurmser's presence ought\r\nrather to have hastened than retarded its surrender.\r\n\r\nThe intrenched camp of the Austrians before Mayence in 1795 would,\r\nindeed, have prevented the siege of the place, if the French had\r\npossessed the means of carrying on a siege, as long as the Rhine had not\r\nbeen crossed; but as soon as Jourdan appeared on the Lahn, and Moreau in\r\nthe Black Forest, it became necessary to abandon the camp and leave the\r\nplace to its own means of defense. It would only be in the event of a\r\nfortress occupying a point such that it would be impossible for an army\r\nto pass it without taking it, that an intrenched camp, with the object\r\nof preventing an attack upon it, would be established; and what place in\r\nEurope is upon such a site?\r\n\r\nSo far from agreeing with these German authors, on the contrary, it\r\nseems to me that a very important question in the establishment of these\r\ncamps near fortified places on a river, is whether they should be on the\r\nsame bank as the place, or upon the other. When it is necessary to make\r\na choice, by reason of the fact that the place cannot be located to\r\ncover both banks, I should decidedly prefer the latter.\r\n\r\nTo serve as a refuge or to favor a debouch, the camp should be on the\r\nbank of the river toward the enemy; and in this, case the principal\r\ndanger to be feared is that the enemy might take the camp in reverse by\r\npassing the river at some other point; and if the fortress were upon the\r\nsame bank us the camp, it would be of little service; while if upon the\r\nother bank, opposite to the camp, it would be almost impossible to take\r\nthe latter in reverse. For instance, the Russians, who could not hold\r\nfor twenty-four hours their camp of Drissa, would have defied the enemy\r\nfor a long time if there had been a fortification on the right bank of\r\nthe Dwina, covering the rear of the camp. So Moreau for three months, at\r\nKehl, withstood all the efforts of the Archduke Charles; while if\r\nStrasbourg had not been there upon the opposite bank his camp would\r\neasily have been turned by a passage of the Rhine.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it would be desirable to have the protection of the fortified\r\nplace upon the other bank too; and a place holding both banks would\r\nfulfill this condition. The fortification of Coblentz, recently\r\nconstructed, seems to introduce a new epoch. This system of the\r\nPrussians, combining the advantages of intrenched camps and permanent\r\nworks, deserves attentive consideration; but, whatever may be its\r\ndefects, it is nevertheless certain that it would afford immense\r\nadvantages to an army intended to operate on the Rhine. Indeed, the\r\ninconvenience of intrenched camps on large rivers is that they are only\r\nvery useful when beyond the river; and in this case they are exposed to\r\nthe dangers arising from destruction of bridges (as happened to Napoleon\r\nat Essling,)--to say nothing of the danger of losing their provisions\r\nand munitions, or even of a front attack against which the works might\r\nnot avail. The system of detached permanent works of Coblentz has the\r\nadvantage of avoiding these dangers, by protecting the depots on the\r\nsame bank as the army, and in guaranteeing to the army freedom from\r\nattack at least until the bridges be re-established. If the city were\r\nupon the right bank of the Rhine, and there were only an intrenched camp\r\nof field-works on the left bank, there would be no certainty of security\r\neither for the depots or the army. So, if Coblentz were a good ordinary\r\nfortress without detached forts, a large army could not so readily make\r\nit a place of refuge, nor would there be such facilities for debouching\r\nfrom it in the presence of an enemy. The fortress of Ehrenbreitstein,\r\nwhich is intended to protect Coblentz on the right bank, is so difficult\r\nof access that it would be quite easy to blockade it, and the egress of\r\na force of any magnitude might be vigorously disputed.\r\n\r\nMuch has been recently said of a new system used by the Archduke\r\nMaximilian to fortify the intrenched camp of Linz,--by masonry towers.\r\nAs I only know of it by hearsay and the description by Captain Allard in\r\nthe _Spectateur Militaire_, I cannot discuss it thoroughly. I only know\r\nthat the system of towers used at Genoa by the skillful Colonel Andreis\r\nappeared to me to be useful, but still susceptible of\r\nimprovements,--which the archduke seems to have added. We are told that\r\nthe towers of Linz, situated in ditches and covered by the glacis, have\r\nthe advantage of giving a concentrated horizontal fire and of being\r\nsheltered from the direct shot of the enemy. Such towers, if well\r\nflanked and connected by a parapet, may make a very advantageous\r\ncamp,--always, however, with some of the inconveniences of closed lines.\r\nIf the towers are isolated, and the intervals carefully covered by\r\nfield-works, (to be thrown up when required,) they will make a camp\r\npreferable to one covered by ordinary redoubts, but not so advantageous\r\nas afforded by the large detached forts of Coblentz. These towers number\r\nthirty-two, eight of which are on the left bank, with a square fort\r\ncommanding the Perlingsberg. Of these twenty-four on the right bank,\r\nsome seven or eight are only half-towers. The circumference of this line\r\nis about twelve miles. The towers are between five hundred and six\r\nhundred yards apart, and will be connected, in case of war, by a\r\npalisaded covered way. They are of masonry, of three tiers of guns, with\r\na barbette battery which is the principal defense, mounting eleven\r\ntwenty-four pounders. Two howitzers are placed in the upper tier. Those\r\ntowers are placed in a wide and deep ditch, the _déblais_ of which forms\r\na high glacis which protects the tower from direct shot; but I should\r\nthink it would be difficult to protect the artillery from direct fire.\r\n\r\nSome say that this has cost about three-fourths of what a complete\r\nbastioned enceinte, necessary to make Linz a fortress of the first rank,\r\nwould have cost; others maintain that it has not cost more than a\r\nquarter as much as a bastioned work, and that it subserves, besides, an\r\nentirely different object. If these works are to resist a regular siege,\r\nthey are certainly very defective; but, regarded as an intrenched camp\r\nto give refuge and an outlet upon both banks of the Danube for a large\r\narmy, they are appropriate, and would be of great importance in a war\r\nlike that of 1809, and, if existing then, would probably have saved the\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nTo complete a grand system, it would perhaps have been better to\r\nencircle Linz with a regular bastioned line, and then to have built\r\nseven or eight towers between the eastern salient and the mouth of the\r\nTraun, within a direct distance of about two and a half miles, so as to\r\nhave included for the camp only the curved space between Linz, the\r\nTraun, and the Danube. Then the double advantage of a fortress of the\r\nfirst rank and a camp under its guns would have been united, and, even\r\nif not quite so large, would have answered for a large army,\r\nparticularly if the eight towers on the left bank and the fort of\r\nPerlingsberg had been preserved.\r\n\r\nTÊTES DE PONTS.\r\n\r\n_Têtes de ponts_ are the most important of all field-works. The\r\ndifficulties of crossing a river, particularly a large one, in the face\r\nof the enemy, demonstrate abundantly the immense utility of such works,\r\nwhich can be less easily dispensed with than intrenched camps, since if\r\nthe bridges are safe an army is insured from the disastrous events which\r\nmay attend a rapid retreat across a large river.\r\n\r\n_Têtes de ponts_ are doubly advantageous when they are as it were\r\n_keeps_ for a large intrenched camp, and will be triply so if they also\r\ncover the bank opposite to the location of the camp, since then they\r\nwill mutually support each other. It is needless to state that these\r\nworks are particularly important in an enemy's country and upon all\r\nfronts where there are no permanent works. It may be observed that the\r\nprincipal difference between the system of intrenched camps and that of\r\n_têtes de ponts_ is that the best intrenched camps are composed of\r\ndetached and closed works, while _têtes de ponts_ usually consist of\r\ncontiguous works not closed. An intrenched line to admit of defense must\r\nbe occupied in force throughout its whole extent, which would generally\r\nrequire a large army; if, on the contrary, the intrenchments are\r\ndetached closed works, a comparatively small force can defend them.\r\n\r\nThe attack and defense of these works will be discussed in a subsequent\r\npart of this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXVIII.\r\n\r\nStrategic Operations in Mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nA mountainous country presents itself, in the combinations of war, under\r\nfour different aspects. It may be the whole theater of the war, or it\r\nmay be but a zone; it may be mountainous throughout its whole extent, or\r\nthere may be a line of mountains, upon emerging from which the army may\r\ndebouch into large and rich plains.\r\n\r\nIf Switzerland, the Tyrol, the Noric provinces, some parts of Turkey and\r\nHungary, Catalonia and Portugal, be excepted, in the European countries\r\nthe mountains are in single ranges. In these cases there is but a\r\ndifficult defile to cross,--a temporary obstacle, which, once overcome,\r\nis an advantage rather than an objection. In fact, the range once\r\ncrossed and the war carried into the plains, the chain of mountains may\r\nbe regarded as an eventual base, upon which the army may fall back and\r\nfind a temporary refuge. The only essential precaution to be observed\r\nis, not to allow the enemy to anticipate the army on this line of\r\nretreat. The part of the Alps between France and Italy, and the\r\nPyrenees, (which are not so high, though equally broad,) are of this\r\nnature. The mountains of Bohemia and of the Black Forest, and the\r\nVosges, belong to this class. In Catalonia the mountains cover the whole\r\ncountry as far as the Ebro: if the war were limited to this province,\r\nthe combinations would not be the same as if there were but a line of\r\nmountains. Hungary in this respect differs little from Lombardy and\r\nCastile; for if the Crapacks in the eastern and northern part are as\r\nmarked a feature as the Pyrenees, they are still but a temporary\r\nobstacle, and an army overcoming it, whether debouching in the basin of\r\nthe Waag, of the Neytra, or of the Theiss, or in the fields of\r\nMongatsch, would have the vast plains between the Danube and the Theiss\r\nfor a field of operations. The only difference would be in the roads,\r\nwhich in the Alps, though few in number, are excellent, while in Hungary\r\nthere are none of much value. In its northern part, this chain, though\r\nnot so high, becomes broader, and would seem to belong to that class of\r\nfields of operations which are wholly mountainous; but, as its\r\nevacuation may be compelled by decisive operations in the valleys of the\r\nWaag or the Theiss, it must be regarded as a temporary barrier. The\r\nattack and defense of this country, however, would be a strategic study\r\nof the most interesting character.\r\n\r\nWhen an extremely mountainous country, such as the Tyrol or Switzerland,\r\nis but a zone of operations, the importance of these mountains is\r\nsecondary, and they must be observed like a fortress, the armies\r\ndeciding the great contests in the valleys. It will, of course, be\r\notherwise if this be the whole field.\r\n\r\nIt has long been a question whether possession of the mountains gave\r\ncontrol of the valleys, or whether possession of the valleys gave\r\ncontrol of the mountains. The Archduke Charles, a very intelligent and\r\ncompetent judge, has declared for the latter, and has demonstrated that\r\nthe valley of the Danube is the key of Southern Germany. However, in\r\nthis kind of questions much depends upon the relative forces and their\r\narrangement in the country. If sixty thousand French were advancing on\r\nBavaria in presence of an equal force of Austrians, and the latter\r\nshould throw thirty thousand men into the Tyrol, intending to replace\r\nthem by reinforcements on its arrival on the Inn, it would be difficult\r\nfor the French to push on as far as this line, leaving so large a force\r\non its flanks masters of the outlets of Scharnitz, Fussen, Kufstein, and\r\nLofers. But if the French force were one hundred and twenty thousand\r\nmen, and had gained such successes as to establish its superiority over\r\nthe army in its front, then it might leave a sufficient detachment to\r\nmask the passes of the Tyrol and extend its progress as far as Linz,--as\r\nMoreau did in 1800.\r\n\r\nThus far we have considered these mountainous districts as only\r\naccessory zones. If we regard them as the principal fields of\r\noperations, the strategic problem seems to be more complicated. The\r\ncampaigns of 1799 and 1800 are equally rich in instruction on this\r\nbranch of the art. In my account of them I have endeavored to bring out\r\ntheir teachings by a historical exposition of the events; and I cannot\r\ndo better than refer my readers to it.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the results of the imprudent invasion of Switzerland by\r\nthe French Directory, and its fatal influence in doubling the extent of\r\nthe theater of operations and making it reach from the Texel to Naples,\r\nwe cannot too much applaud the wisdom of France and Austria in the\r\ntransactions which had for three centuries guaranteed the neutrality of\r\nSwitzerland. Every one will be convinced of this by carefully studying\r\nthe interesting campaigns of the Archduke Charles, Suwaroff, and\r\nMassena in 1799, and those of Napoleon and Moreau in 1800. The first is\r\na model for operations upon an entirely mountainous field; the second is\r\na model for wars in which the fate of mountainous countries is decided\r\non the plains.\r\n\r\nI will here state some of the deductions which seem to follow from this\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nWhen a country whose whole extent is mountainous is the principal\r\ntheater of operations, the strategic combinations cannot be entirely\r\nbased upon maxims applicable in an open country.\r\n\r\nTransversal maneuvers to gain the extremity of the front of operations\r\nof the enemy here become always very difficult, and often impossible. In\r\nsuch a country a considerable army can be maneuvered only in a small\r\nnumber of valleys, where the enemy will take care to post advanced\r\nguards of sufficient strength to delay the army long enough to provide\r\nmeans for defeating the enterprise; and, as the ridges which separate\r\nthese valleys will be generally crossed only by paths impracticable for\r\nthe passage of an army, transversal marches can only be made by small\r\nbodies of light troops.\r\n\r\nThe important natural strategic points will be at the junction of the\r\nlarger valleys or of the streams in those valleys, and will be few in\r\nnumber; and, if the defensive army occupy them with the mass of its\r\nforces, the invader will generally be compelled to resort to direct\r\nattacks to dislodge it.\r\n\r\nHowever, if great strategic maneuvers in these cases be more rare and\r\ndifficult, it by no means follows that they are less important. On the\r\ncontrary, if the assailant succeed in gaining possession of one of these\r\ncenters of communication between the large valleys upon the line of\r\nretreat of the enemy, it will be more serious for the latter than it\r\nwould be in an open country; since the occupation of one or two\r\ndifficult defiles will often be sufficient to cause the ruin of the\r\nwhole army.\r\n\r\nIf the attacking party have difficulties to overcome, it must be\r\nadmitted that the defense has quite as many, on account of the necessity\r\nof covering all the outlets by which an attack in force may be made\r\nupon the decisive points, and of the difficulties of the transversal\r\nmarches which it would be compelled to make to cover the menaced points.\r\nIn order to complete what I have said upon this kind of marches and the\r\ndifficulties of directing them, I will refer to what Napoleon did in\r\n1805 to cut off Mack from Ulm. If this operation was facilitated by the\r\nhundred roads which cross Swabia in all directions, and if it would have\r\nbeen impracticable in a mountainous country, for want of transversal\r\nroutes, to make the long circuit from Donauwerth by Augsburg to\r\nMemmingen, it is also true that Mack could by these same hundred roads\r\nhave effected his retreat with much greater facility than if he had been\r\nentrapped in one of the valleys of Switzerland or of the Tyrol, from\r\nwhich there was but a single outlet.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the general on the defensive may in a level country\r\nconcentrate a large part of his forces; for, if the enemy scatter to\r\noccupy all the roads by which the defensive army may retire, it will be\r\neasy for the latter to crush these isolated bodies; but in a very\r\nmountainous country, where there are ordinarily but one or two principal\r\nroutes into which other valleys open, even from the direction of the\r\nenemy, the concentration of forces becomes more difficult, since serious\r\ninconveniences may result if even one of these important valleys be not\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nNothing can better demonstrate the difficulty of strategic defense in\r\nmountainous regions than the perplexity in which we are involved when we\r\nattempt simply to give advice in such cases,--to say nothing of laying\r\ndown maxims for them. If it were but a question of the defense of a\r\nsingle definite front of small extent, consisting of four or five\r\nconverging valleys, the common junction of which is at a distance of two\r\nor three short marches from the summits of the ranges, it would be\r\neasier of solution. It would then be sufficient to recommend the\r\nconstruction of a good fort at the narrowest and least-easily turned\r\npoint of each of these valleys. Protected by these forts, a few brigades\r\nof infantry should be stationed to dispute the passage, while half the\r\narmy should be held in reserve at the junction, where it would be in\r\nposition either to sustain the advanced guards most seriously\r\nthreatened, or to fall upon the assailant with the whole force when he\r\ndebouches. If to this be added good instructions to the commanders of\r\nthe advanced guards, whether in assigning them the best point for\r\nrendezvous when their line of forts is pierced, or in directing them to\r\ncontinue to act in the mountains upon the flank of the enemy, the\r\ngeneral on the defensive may regard himself as invincible, thanks to the\r\nmany difficulties which the country offers to the assailant. But, if\r\nthere be other fronts like this upon the right and left, all of which\r\nare to be defended, the problem is changed: the difficulties of the\r\ndefense increase with the extent of the fronts, and this system of a\r\ncordon of forts becomes dangerous,--while it is not easy to adopt a\r\nbetter one.\r\n\r\nWe cannot be better convinced of these truths than by the consideration\r\nof the position of Massena in Switzerland in 1799. After Jourdan's\r\ndefeat at Stockach, he occupied the line from Basel by Schaffhausen and\r\nRheineck to Saint-Gothard, and thence by La Furca to Mont-Blanc. He had\r\nenemies in front of Basel, at Waldshut, at Schaffhausen, at Feldkirch,\r\nand at Chur; Bellegarde threatened the Saint-Gothard, and the Italian\r\narmy menaced the Simplon and the Saint-Bernard. How was he to defend\r\nsuch a circumference? and how could he leave open one of these great\r\nvalleys, thus risking every thing? From Rheinfelden to the Jura, toward\r\nSoleure, it was but two short marches, and there was the mouth of the\r\ntrap in which the French army was placed. This was, then, the pivot of\r\nthe defense. But how could he leave Schaffhausen unprotected? how\r\nabandon Rheineck and the Saint-Gothard? how open the Valais and the\r\napproach by Berne, without surrendering the whole of Switzerland to the\r\nCoalition? And if he covered each point even by a brigade, where would\r\nbe his army when he would need it to give battle to an approaching\r\nforce? It is a natural system on a level theater to concentrate the\r\nmasses of an army; but in the mountains such a course would surrender\r\nthe keys of the country, and, besides, it is not easy to say where an\r\ninferior army could be concentrated without compromising it.\r\n\r\nAfter the forced evacuation of the line of the Rhine and Zurich, it\r\nseemed that the only strategic point for Massena to defend was the line\r\nof the Jura. He was rash enough to stand upon the Albis,--a line shorter\r\nthan that of the Rhine, it is true, but exposed for an immense distance\r\nto the attacks of the Austrians. If Bellegarde, instead of going into\r\nLombardy by the Valtellina, had marched to Berne or made a junction with\r\nthe archduke, Massena would have been ruined. These events seem to prove\r\nthat if a country covered with high mountains be favorable for defense\r\nin a tactical point of view, it is different in a strategic sense,\r\nbecause it necessitates a division of the troops. This can only be\r\nremedied by giving them greater mobility and by passing often to the\r\noffensive.\r\n\r\nGeneral Clausewitz, whose logic is frequently defective, maintains, on\r\nthe contrary, that, movements being the most difficult part in this kind\r\nof war, the defensive party should avoid them, since by such a course he\r\nmight lose the advantages of the local defenses. He, however, ends by\r\ndemonstrating that a passive defense must yield under an active\r\nattack,--which goes to show that the initiative is no less favorable in\r\nmountains than in plains. If there could be any doubt on this point, it\r\nought to be dispelled by Massena's campaign in Switzerland, where he\r\nsustained himself only by attacking the enemy at every opportunity, even\r\nwhen he was obliged to seek him on the Grimsel and the Saint-Gothard.\r\nNapoleon's course was similar in 1796 in the Tyrol, when he was opposed\r\nto Wurmser and Alvinzi.\r\n\r\nAs for detailed strategic maneuvers, they may be comprehended by reading\r\nthe events of Suwaroff's expedition by the Saint-Gothard upon the\r\nMuttenthal. While we must approve his maneuvers in endeavoring to\r\ncapture Lecourbe in the valley of the Reuss, we must also admire the\r\npresence of mind, activity, and unyielding firmness which saved that\r\ngeneral and his division. Afterward, in the Schachenthal and the\r\nMuttenthal, Suwaroff was placed in the same position as Lecourbe had\r\nbeen, and extricated himself with equal ability. Not less extraordinary\r\nwas the ten days' campaign of General Molitor, who with four thousand\r\nmen was surrounded in the canton of Glaris by more than thirty thousand\r\nallies, and yet succeeded in maintaining himself behind the Linth after\r\nfour admirable fights. These events teach us the vanity of all theory\r\n_in details_, and also that in such a country a strong and heroic will\r\nis worth more than all the precepts in the world. After such lessons,\r\nneed I say that one of the principal rules of this kind of war is, not\r\nto risk one's self in the valleys without securing the heights? Shall I\r\nsay also that in this kind of war, more than in any other, operations\r\nshould be directed upon the communications of the enemy? And, finally,\r\nthat good temporary bases or lines of defense at the confluence of the\r\ngreat valleys, covered by strategic reserves, combined with great\r\nmobility and frequent offensive movements, will be the best means of\r\ndefending the country?\r\n\r\nI cannot terminate this article without remarking that mountainous\r\ncountries are particularly favorable for defense when the war is a\r\nnational one, in which the whole people rise up to defend their homes\r\nwith the obstinacy which enthusiasm for a holy cause imparts: every\r\nadvance is then dearly bought. But to be successful it is always\r\nnecessary that the people be sustained by a disciplined force, more or\r\nless numerous: without this they must finally yield, like the heroes of\r\nStanz and of the Tyrol.\r\n\r\nThe offensive against a mountainous country also presents a double case:\r\nit may either be directed upon a belt of mountains beyond which are\r\nextensive plains, or the whole theater may be mountainous.\r\n\r\nIn the first case there is little more to be done than this,--viz.: make\r\ndemonstrations upon the whole line of the frontier, in order to lead the\r\nenemy to extend his defense, and then force a passage at the point which\r\npromises the greatest results. The problem in such a case is to break\r\nthrough a cordon which is strong less on account of the numbers of the\r\ndefenders than from their position, and if broken at one point the whole\r\nline is forced. The history of Bard in 1800, and the capture of\r\nLeutasch and Scharnitz in 1805 by Ney, (who threw fourteen thousand men\r\non Innspruck in the midst of thirty thousand Austrians, and by seizing\r\nthis central point compelled them to retreat in all directions,) show\r\nthat with brave infantry and bold commanders these famous\r\nmountain-ranges can generally be forced.\r\n\r\nThe history of the passage of the Alps, where Francis I. turned the army\r\nwhich was awaiting him at Suza by passing the steep mountains between\r\nMont-Cenis and the valley of Queyras, is an example of those\r\n_insurmountable_ obstacles which can always be surmounted. To oppose him\r\nit would have been necessary to adopt a system of cordon; and we have\r\nalready seen what is to be expected of it. The position of the Swiss and\r\nItalians at Suza was even less wise than the cordon-system, because it\r\ninclosed them in a contracted valley without protecting the lateral\r\nissues. Their strategic plan ought to have been to throw troops into\r\nthese valleys to defend the defiles, and to post the bulk of the army\r\ntoward Turin or Carignano.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the _tactical_ difficulties of this kind of war, and\r\nthe immense advantages it affords the defense, we may be inclined to\r\nregard the concentration of a considerable force to penetrate by a\r\nsingle valley as an extremely rash maneuver, and to think that it ought\r\nto be divided into as many columns as there are practicable passes. In\r\nmy opinion, this is one of the most dangerous of all illusions; and to\r\nconfirm what I say it is only necessary to refer to the fate of the\r\ncolumns of Championnet at the battle of Fossano. If there be five or six\r\nroads on the menaced front, they should all, of course, be threatened;\r\nbut the army should cross the chain in not more than two masses, and the\r\nroutes which these follow should not be divergent; for if they were, the\r\nenemy might be able to defeat them separately. Napoleon's passage of the\r\nSaint-Bernard was wisely planned. He formed the bulk of his army on the\r\ncenter, with a division on each flank by Mont-Cenis and the Simplon, to\r\ndivide the attention of the enemy and flank his march.\r\n\r\nThe invasion of a country entirely covered with mountains is a much\r\ngreater and more difficult task than where a dénouement may be\r\naccomplished by a decisive battle in the open country; for fields of\r\nbattle for the deployment of large masses are rare in a mountainous\r\nregion, and the war becomes a succession of partial combats. Here it\r\nwould be imprudent, perhaps, to penetrate on a single point by a narrow\r\nand deep valley, whose outlets might be closed by the enemy and thus the\r\ninvading army be endangered: it might penetrate by the wings on two or\r\nthree lateral lines, whose outlets should not be too widely separated,\r\nthe marches being so arranged that the masses may debouch at the\r\njunction of the valleys at nearly the same instant. The enemy should be\r\ndriven from all the ridges which separate these valleys.\r\n\r\nOf all mountainous countries, the tactical defense of Switzerland would\r\nbe the easiest, if all her inhabitants were united in spirit; and with\r\ntheir assistance a disciplined force might hold its own against a triple\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nTo give specific precepts for complications which vary infinitely with\r\nlocalities, the resources and the condition of the people and armies,\r\nwould be absurd. History, well studied and understood, is the best\r\nschool for this kind of warfare. The account of the campaign of 1799 by\r\nthe Archduke Charles, that of the campaigns which I have given in my\r\nHistory of the Wars of the Revolution, the narrative of the campaign of\r\nthe Grisons by Ségur and Mathieu Dumas, that of Catalonia by Saint-Cyr\r\nand Suchet, the campaign of the Duke de Rohan in Valtellina, and the\r\npassage of the Alps by Gaillard, (Francis I.,) are good guides in this\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXIX.\r\n\r\nGrand Invasions and Distant Expeditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are several kinds of distant expeditions. The first are those\r\nwhich are merely auxiliary and belong to wars of intervention. The\r\nsecond are great continental invasions, through extensive tracts of\r\ncountry, which may be either friendly, neutral, doubtful, or hostile.\r\nThe third are of the same nature, but made partly on land, partly by sea\r\nby means of numerous fleets. The fourth class comprises those beyond the\r\nseas, to found, defend, or attack distant colonies. The fifth includes\r\nthe great descents, where the distance passed over is not very great,\r\nbut where a powerful state is attacked.\r\n\r\nAs to the first, in a strategic point of view, a Russian army on the\r\nRhine or in Italy, in alliance with the German States, would certainly\r\nbe stronger and more favorably situated than if it had reached either of\r\nthese points by passing over hostile or even neutral territory; for its\r\nbase, lines of operations, and eventual points of support will be the\r\nsame as those of its allies; it may find refuge behind their lines of\r\ndefense, provisions in their depots, and munitions in their\r\narsenals;--while in the other case its resources would be upon the\r\nVistula or the Niemen, and it might afford another example of the sad\r\nfate of many of these great invasions.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the important difference between a war in which a state is\r\nmerely an auxiliary, and a distant invasion undertaken for its own\r\ninterest and with its own resources, there are, nevertheless, dangers in\r\nthe way of these auxiliary armies, and perplexity for the commander of\r\nall the armies,--particularly if he belong to the state which is not a\r\nprincipal party; as may be learned from the campaign of 1805. General\r\nKoutousoff advanced on the Inn to the boundaries of Bavaria with thirty\r\nthousand Russians, to effect a junction with Mack, whose army in the\r\nmean time had been destroyed, with the exception of eighteen thousand\r\nmen brought back from Donauwerth by Kienmayer. The Russian general thus\r\nfound himself with fifty thousand men exposed to the impetuous activity\r\nof Napoleon with one hundred and fifty thousand, and, to complete his\r\nmisfortune, he was separated from his own frontiers by a distance of\r\nabout seven hundred and fifty miles. His position would have been\r\nhopeless if fifty thousand men had not arrived to reinforce him. The\r\nbattle of Austerlitz--due to a fault of Weyrother--endangered the\r\nRussian army anew, since it was so far from its base. It almost became\r\nthe victim of a distant alliance; and it was only peace that gave it the\r\nopportunity of regaining its own country.\r\n\r\nThe fate of Suwaroff after the victory of Novi, especially in the\r\nexpedition to Switzerland, and that of Hermann's corps at Bergen in\r\nHolland, are examples which should be well studied by every commander\r\nunder such circumstances. General Benningsen's position in 1807 was less\r\ndisadvantageous, because, being between the Vistula and the Niemen, his\r\ncommunications with his base were preserved and his operations were in\r\nno respect dependent upon his allies. We may also refer to the fate of\r\nthe French in Bohemia and Bavaria in 1742, when Frederick the Great\r\nabandoned them and made a separate peace. In this case the parties were\r\nallies rather than auxiliaries; but in the latter relation the political\r\nties are never woven so closely as to remove all points of dissension\r\nwhich may compromise military operations. Examples of this kind have\r\nbeen cited in Article XIX., on political objective points.\r\n\r\nHistory alone furnishes us instruction in reference to distant invasions\r\nacross extensive territories. When half of Europe was covered with\r\nforests, pasturages, and flocks, and when only horses and iron were\r\nnecessary to transplant whole nations from one end of the continent to\r\nthe other, the Goths, Huns, Vandals, Normans, Arabs, and Tartars overran\r\nempires in succession. But since the invention of powder and artillery\r\nand the organization of formidable standing armies, and particularly\r\nsince civilization and statesmanship have brought nations closer\r\ntogether and have taught them the necessity of reciprocally sustaining\r\neach other, no such events have taken place.\r\n\r\nBesides these migrations of nations, there were other expeditions in the\r\nMiddle Ages, which were of a more military character, as those of\r\nCharlemagne and others. Since the invention of powder there have been\r\nscarcely any, except the advance of Charles VIII. to Naples, and of\r\nCharles XII. into the Ukraine, which can be called distant invasions;\r\nfor the campaigns of the Spaniards in Flanders and of the Swedes in\r\nGermany were of a particular kind. The first was a civil war, and the\r\nSwedes were only auxiliaries to the Protestants of Germany; and,\r\nbesides, the forces concerned in both were not large. In modern times no\r\none but Napoleon has dared to transport the armies of half of Europe\r\nfrom the Rhine to the Volga; and there is little danger that he will be\r\nimitated.\r\n\r\nApart from the modifications which result from great distances, all\r\ninvasions, after the armies arrive upon the actual theater, present the\r\nsame operations as all other wars. As the chief difficulty arises from\r\nthese great distances, we should recall our maxims on deep lines of\r\noperations, strategic reserves, and eventual bases, as the only ones\r\napplicable; and here it is that their application is indispensable,\r\nalthough even that will not avert all danger. The campaign of 1812,\r\nalthough so ruinous to Napoleon, was a model for a distant invasion. His\r\ncare in leaving Prince Schwarzenberg and Reynier on the Bug, while\r\nMacdonald, Oudinot, and Wrede guarded the Dwina, Victor covered\r\nSmolensk, and Augereau was between the Oder and Vistula, proves that he\r\nhad neglected no humanly possible precaution in order to base himself\r\nsafely; but it also proves that the greatest enterprises may fail simply\r\non account of the magnitude of the preparations for their success.\r\n\r\nIf Napoleon erred in this contest, it was in neglecting diplomatic\r\nprecautions; in not uniting under one commander the different bodies of\r\ntroops on the Dwina and Dnieper; in remaining ten days too long at\r\nWilna; in giving the command of his right to his brother, who was\r\nunequal to it; and in confiding to Prince Schwarzenberg a duty which\r\nthat general could not perform with the devotedness of a Frenchman. I do\r\nnot speak now of his error in remaining in Moscow after the\r\nconflagration, since then there was no remedy for the misfortune;\r\nalthough it would not have been so great if the retreat had taken place\r\nimmediately. He has also been accused of having too much despised\r\ndistances, difficulties, and men, in pushing on as far as the Kremlin.\r\nBefore passing judgment upon him in this matter, however, we ought to\r\nknow the real motives which induced him to pass Smolensk, instead of\r\nwintering there as he had intended, and whether it would have been\r\npossible for him to remain between that city and Vitebsk without having\r\npreviously defeated the Russian army.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless true that Napoleon neglected too much the resentment of\r\nAustria, Prussia, and Sweden, and counted too surely upon a _dénouement_\r\nbetween Wilna and the Dwina. Although he fully appreciated the bravery\r\nof the Russian armies, he did not realize the spirit and energy of the\r\npeople. Finally, and chiefly, instead of procuring the hearty and\r\nsincere concurrence of a military state, whose territories would have\r\ngiven him a sure base for his attack upon the colossal power of Russia,\r\nhe founded his enterprise upon the co-operation of a brave and\r\nenthusiastic but fickle people, and besides, he neglected to turn to the\r\ngreatest advantage this ephemeral enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe fate of all such enterprises makes it evident that the capital point\r\nfor their success, and, in fact, the only maxim to be given, is \"never\r\nto attempt them without having secured the hearty and constant alliance\r\nof a respectable power near enough the field of operations to afford a\r\nproper base, where supplies of every kind may be accumulated, and which\r\nmay also in case of reverse serve as a refuge and afford new means of\r\nresuming the offensive.\" As to the precautions to be observed in these\r\noperations, the reader is referred to Articles XXI. and XXII., on the\r\nsafety of deep lines of operations and the establishment of eventual\r\nbases, as giving all the military means of lessening the danger; to\r\nthese should be added a just appreciation of distances, obstacles,\r\nseasons, and countries,--in short, accuracy in calculation and\r\nmoderation in success, in order that the enterprise may not be carried\r\ntoo far. We are far from thinking that any purely military maxims can\r\ninsure the success of remote invasions: in four thousand years only five\r\nor six have been successful, and in a hundred instances they have nearly\r\nruined nations and armies.\r\n\r\nExpeditions of the third class, partly on land, partly by sea, have been\r\nrare since the invention of artillery, the Crusades being the last in\r\ndate of occurrence; and probably the cause is that the control of the\r\nsea, after having been held in succession by several secondary powers,\r\nhas passed into the hands of England, an insular power, rich in ships,\r\nbut without the land-forces necessary for such expeditions.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that from both of these causes the condition of things now\r\nis very different from that existing when Xerxes marched to the conquest\r\nof Greece, followed by four thousand vessels of all dimensions, or when\r\nAlexander marched from Macedonia over Asia Minor to Tyre, while his\r\nfleet coasted the shore.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, if we no longer see such invasions, it is very true that\r\nthe assistance of a fleet of men-of-war and transports will always be of\r\nimmense value to any army on shore when the two can act in concert.\r\nStill, sailing-ships are an uncertain resource, for their progress\r\ndepends upon the winds,--which may be unfavorable: in addition, any kind\r\nof fleet is exposed to great dangers in storms, which are not of rare\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nThe more or less hostile tone of the people, the length of the line of\r\noperations, and the great distance of the principal objective point, are\r\nthe only points which require any deviation from the ordinary operations\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nInvasions of neighboring states, if less dangerous than distant ones,\r\nare still not without great danger of failure. A French army attacking\r\nCadiz might find a tomb on the Guadalquivir, although well based upon\r\nthe Pyrenees and possessing intermediate bases upon the Ebro and the\r\nTagus. Likewise, the army which in 1809 besieged Komorn in the heart of\r\nHungary might have been destroyed on the plains of Wagram without going\r\nas far as the Beresina. The antecedents, the number of disposable\r\ntroops, the successes already gained, the state of the country, will all\r\nbe elements in determining the extent of the enterprises to be\r\nundertaken; and to be able to proportion them well to his resources, in\r\nview of the attendant circumstances, is a great talent in a general.\r\nAlthough diplomacy does not play so important a part in these invasions\r\nas in those more distant, it is still of importance; since, as stated in\r\nArticle VI., there is no enemy, however insignificant, whom it would not\r\nbe useful to convert into an ally. The influence which the change of\r\npolicy of the Duke of Savoy in 1706 exercised over the events of that\r\nday, and the effects of the stand taken by Maurice of Saxony in 1551,\r\nand of Bavaria in 1813, prove clearly the importance of securing the\r\nstrict neutrality of all states adjoining the theater of war, when their\r\nco-operation cannot be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nEPITOME OF STRATEGY\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe task which I undertook seems to me to have been passably fulfilled\r\nby what has been stated in reference to the strategic combinations which\r\nenter ordinarily into a plan of campaign. We have seen, from the\r\ndefinition at the beginning of this chapter, that, in the most important\r\noperations in war, _strategy_ fixes the direction of movements, and that\r\nwe depend upon _tactics_ for their execution. Therefore, before treating\r\nof these mixed operations, it will be well to give here the combinations\r\nof grand tactics and of battles, as well as the maxims by the aid of\r\nwhich the application of the fundamental principle of war may be made.\r\n\r\nBy this method these operations, half strategic and half tactical, will\r\nbe better comprehended as a whole; but, in the first place, I will give\r\na synopsis of the contents of the preceding chapter.\r\n\r\nFrom the different articles which compose it, we may conclude that the\r\nmanner of applying the general principle of war to all possible theaters\r\nof operations is found in what follows:--\r\n\r\n1. In knowing how to make the best use of the advantages which the\r\nreciprocal directions of the two bases of operations may afford, in\r\naccordance with Article XVIII.\r\n\r\n2. In choosing, from the three zones ordinarily found in the strategic\r\nfield, that one upon which the greatest injury can be done to the enemy\r\nwith the least risk to one's self.\r\n\r\n3. In establishing well, and giving a good direction to, the lines of\r\noperations; adopting for defense the concentric system of the Archduke\r\nCharles in 1796 and of Napoleon in 1814; or that of Soult in 1814, for\r\nretreats parallel to the frontiers.\r\n\r\nOn the offensive we should follow the system which led to the success\r\nof Napoleon in 1800, 1805, and 1806, when he directed his line upon the\r\nextremity of the strategic front; or we might adopt his plan which was\r\nsuccessful in 1796, 1809, and 1814, of directing the line of operations\r\nupon the center of the strategic front: all of which is to be determined\r\nby the respective positions of the armies, and according to the maxims\r\npresented in Article XXI.\r\n\r\n4. In selecting judicious eventual lines of maneuver, by giving them\r\nsuch directions as always to be able to act with the greater mass of the\r\nforces, and to prevent the parts of the enemy from concentrating or from\r\naffording each other mutual support.\r\n\r\n5. In combining, in the same spirit of centralization, all strategic\r\npositions, and all large detachments made to cover the most important\r\nstrategic points of the theater of war.\r\n\r\n6. In imparting to the troops the greatest possible mobility and\r\nactivity, so as, by their successive employment upon points where it may\r\nbe important to act, to bring superior force to bear upon fractions of\r\nthe hostile army.\r\n\r\nThe system of rapid and continuous marches multiplies the effect of an\r\narmy, and at the same time neutralizes a great part of that of the\r\nenemy's, and is often sufficient to insure success; but its effect will\r\nbe quintupled if the marches be skillfully directed upon the decisive\r\nstrategic points of the zone of operations, where the severest blows to\r\nthe enemy can be given.\r\n\r\nHowever, as a general may not always be prepared to adopt this decisive\r\ncourse to the exclusion of every other, he must then be content with\r\nattaining a part of the object of every enterprise, by rapid and\r\nsuccessive employment of his forces upon isolated bodies of the enemy,\r\nthus insuring their defeat. A general who moves his masses rapidly and\r\ncontinually, and gives them proper directions, may be confident both of\r\ngaining victories and of securing great results therefrom.\r\n\r\nThe oft-cited operations of 1809 and 1814 prove these truths most\r\nsatisfactorily, as also does that ordered by Carnot in 1793, already\r\nmentioned in Article XXIV., and the details of which may be found in\r\nVolume IV. of my History of the Wars of the Revolution. Forty\r\nbattalions, carried successively from Dunkirk to Menin, Maubeuge, and\r\nLandau, by reinforcing the armies already at those points, gained four\r\nvictories and saved France. The whole science of marches would have been\r\nfound in this wise operation had it been directed upon the decisive\r\nstrategic point. The Austrian was then the principal army of the\r\nCoalition, and its line of retreat was upon Cologne: hence it was upon\r\nthe Meuse that a general effort of the French would have inflicted the\r\nmost severe blow. The Committee of Public Safety provided for the most\r\npressing danger, and the maneuver contains half of the strategic\r\nprinciple; the other half consists in giving to such efforts the most\r\ndecisive direction, as Napoleon did at Ulm, at Jena, and at Ratisbon.\r\nThe whole of strategy is contained in these four examples.\r\n\r\nIt is superfluous to add that one of the great ends of strategy is to be\r\nable to assure real advantages to the army by preparing the theater of\r\nwar most favorable for its operations, if they take place in its own\r\ncountry, by the location of fortified places, of intrenched camps, and\r\nof _têtes de ponts_, and by the opening of communications in the great\r\ndecisive directions: these constitute not the least interesting part of\r\nthe science. We have already seen how we are to recognize these lines\r\nand these decisive points, whether permanent or temporary. Napoleon has\r\nafforded instruction on this point by the roads of the Simplon and\r\nMont-Cenis; and Austria since 1815 has profited by it in the roads from\r\nthe Tyrol to Lombardy, the Saint-Gothard, and the Splugen, as well as by\r\ndifferent fortified places projected or completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nGRAND TACTICS AND BATTLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBattles are the actual conflicts of armies contending about great\r\nquestions of national policy and of strategy. Strategy directs armies to\r\nthe decisive points of a zone of operations, and influences, in advance,\r\nthe results of battles; but tactics, aided by courage, by genius and\r\nfortune, gains victories.\r\n\r\nGrand tactics is the art of making good combinations preliminary to\r\nbattles, as well as during their progress. The guiding principle in\r\ntactical combinations, as in those of strategy, is to bring the mass of\r\nthe force in hand against a part of the opposing army, and upon that\r\npoint the possession of which promises the most important results.\r\n\r\nBattles have been stated by some writers to be the chief and deciding\r\nfeatures of war. This assertion is not strictly true, as armies have\r\nbeen destroyed by strategic operations without the occurrence of pitched\r\nbattles, by a succession of inconsiderable affairs. It is also true that\r\na complete and decided victory may give rise to results of the same\r\ncharacter when there may have been no grand strategic combinations.\r\n\r\nThe results of a battle generally depend upon a union of causes which\r\nare not always within the scope of the military art: the nature of the\r\norder of battle adopted, the greater or less wisdom displayed in the\r\nplan of the battle, as well as the manner of carrying out its details,\r\nthe more or less loyal and enlightened co-operation of the officers\r\nsubordinate to the commander-in-chief, the cause of the contest, the\r\nproportions and quality of the troops, their greater or less enthusiasm,\r\nsuperiority on the one side or the other in artillery or cavalry, and\r\nthe manner of handling these arms; but it is the _morale_ of armies, as\r\nwell as of nations, more than any thing else, which makes victories and\r\ntheir results decisive. Clausewitz commits a grave error in asserting\r\nthat a battle not characterized by a maneuver to turn the enemy cannot\r\nresult in a complete victory. At the battle of Zama, Hannibal, in a few\r\nbrief hours, saw the fruits of twenty years of glory and success vanish\r\nbefore his eyes, although Scipio never had a thought of turning his\r\nposition. At Rivoli the turning-party was completely beaten; nor was the\r\nmaneuver more successful at Stockach in 1799, or at Austerlitz in 1805.\r\nAs is evident from Article XXXII., I by no means intend to discourage\r\nthe use of that maneuver, being, on the contrary, a constant advocate of\r\nit; but it is very important to know how to use it skillfully and\r\nopportunely, and I am, moreover, of opinion that if it be a general's\r\ndesign to make himself master of his enemy's communications while at the\r\nsame time holding his own, he would do better to employ strategic than\r\ntactical combinations to accomplish it.\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of battles: 1st, defensive battles, or those\r\nfought by armies in favorable positions taken up to await the enemy's\r\nattack; 2d, offensive battles, where one army attacks another in\r\nposition; 3d, battles fought unexpectedly, and resulting from the\r\ncollision of two armies meeting on the march. We will examine in\r\nsuccession the different combinations they present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXX.\r\n\r\nPositions and Defensive Battles.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen an army awaits an attack, it takes up a position and forms its line\r\nof battle. From the general definitions given at the beginning of this\r\nwork, it will appear that I make a distinction between _lines of battle_\r\nand _orders of battle_,--things which have been constantly confounded. I\r\nwill designate as a _line of battle_ the position occupied by\r\nbattalions, either deployed or in columns of attack, which an army will\r\ntake up to hold a camp and a certain portion of ground where it will\r\nawait attack, having no particular project in view for the future: it is\r\nthe right name to give to a body of troops formed with proper tactical\r\nintervals and distances upon one or more lines, as will be more fully\r\nexplained in Article XLIII. On the contrary, I will designate as an\r\n_order of battle_ an arrangement of troops indicating an intention to\r\nexecute a certain maneuver; as, for example, the parallel order, the\r\noblique order, the perpendicular order.\r\n\r\nThis nomenclature, although new, seems necessary to keeping up a proper\r\ndistinction between two things which should by no means be\r\nconfounded.[22] From the nature of the two things, it is evident that\r\nthe _line of battle_ belongs especially to defensive arrangements;\r\nbecause an army awaiting an attack without knowing what or where it will\r\nbe must necessarily form a rather indefinite and objectless line of\r\nbattle. _Order of battle_, on the contrary, indicating an arrangement of\r\ntroops formed with an intention of fighting while executing some\r\nmaneuver previously determined upon, belongs more particularly to\r\noffensive dispositions. However, it is by no means pretended that the\r\nline of battle is exclusively a defensive arrangement; for a body of\r\ntroops may in this formation very well proceed to the attack of a\r\nposition, while an army on the defensive may use the oblique order or\r\nany other. I refer above only to ordinary cases.\r\n\r\nWithout adhering strictly to what is called the system of a war of\r\npositions, an army may often find it proper to await the enemy at a\r\nfavorable point, strong by nature and selected beforehand for the\r\npurpose of there fighting a defensive battle. Such a position may be\r\ntaken up when the object is to cover an important objective point, such\r\nas a capital, large depots, or a decisive strategic point which controls\r\nthe surrounding country, or, finally, to cover a siege.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of positions,--the _strategic_, which has been\r\ndiscussed in Article XX., and the _tactical_. The latter, again, are\r\nsubdivided. In the first place, there are intrenched positions occupied\r\nto await the enemy under cover of works more or less connected,--in a\r\nword, intrenched camps. Their relations to strategic operations have\r\nbeen treated in Article XXVII., and their attack and defense are\r\ndiscussed in Article XXXV. Secondly, we have positions naturally strong,\r\nwhere armies encamp for the purpose of gaining a few days' time. Third\r\nand last are open positions, chosen in advance to fight on the\r\ndefensive. The characteristics to be sought in these positions vary\r\naccording to the object in view: it is, however, a matter of importance\r\nnot to be carried away by the mistaken idea, which prevails too\r\nextensively, of giving the preference to positions that are very steep\r\nand difficult of access,--quite suitable places, probably, for temporary\r\ncamps, but not always the best for battle-grounds. A position of this\r\nkind, to be really strong, must be not only steep and difficult of\r\naccess, but should be adapted to the end had in view in occupying it,\r\nshould offer as many advantages as possible for the kind of troops\r\nforming the principal strength of the army, and, finally, the obstacles\r\npresented by its features should be more disadvantageous for the enemy\r\nthan for the assailed. For example, it is certain that Massena, in\r\ntaking the strong position of the Albis, would have made a great error\r\nif his chief strength had been in cavalry and artillery; whilst it was\r\nexactly what was wanted for his excellent infantry. For the same reason,\r\nWellington, whose whole dependence was in the fire of his troops, made a\r\ngood choice of position at Waterloo, where all the avenues of approach\r\nwere well swept by his guns. The position of the Albis was, moreover,\r\nrather a strategic position, that of Waterloo being simply a\r\nbattle-ground.\r\n\r\nThe rules to be generally observed in selecting tactical positions are\r\nthe following:--\r\n\r\n     1. To have the communications to the front such as to make it\r\n     easier to fall upon the enemy at a favorable moment than for him to\r\n     approach the line of battle.\r\n\r\n     2. To give the artillery all its effect in the defense.\r\n\r\n     3. To have the ground suitable for concealing the movements of\r\n     troops between the wings, that they may be massed upon any point\r\n     deemed the proper one.\r\n\r\n     4. To be able to have a good view of the enemy's movements.\r\n\r\n     5. To have an unobstructed line of retreat.\r\n\r\n     6. To have the flanks well protected, either by natural or\r\n     artificial obstacles, so as to render impossible an attack upon\r\n     their extremities, and to oblige the enemy to attack the center, or\r\n     at least some point of the front.\r\n\r\n     This is a difficult condition to fulfill; for, if an army rests on\r\n     a river, or a mountain, or an impenetrable forest, and the smallest\r\n     reverse happens to it, a great disaster may be the result of the\r\n     broken line being forced back upon the very obstacles which seemed\r\n     to afford perfect protection. This danger--about which there can be\r\n     no doubt--gives rise to the thought that points admitting an easy\r\n     defense are better on a battle-field than insurmountable\r\n     obstacles.[23]\r\n\r\n     7. Sometimes a want of proper support for the flanks is remedied by\r\n     throwing a crotchet to the rear. This is dangerous; because a\r\n     crotchet stuck on a line hinders its movements, and the enemy may\r\n     cause great loss of life by placing his artillery in the angle of\r\n     the two lines prolonged. A strong reserve in close column behind\r\n     the wing to be guarded from assault seems better to fulfill the\r\n     required condition than the crotchet; but the nature of the ground\r\n     must always decide in the choice between the two methods. Full\r\n     details on this point are given in the description of the battle of\r\n     Prague, (Chapter II. of the Seven Years' War.)\r\n\r\n\r\n     8. We must endeavor in a defensive position not only to cover the\r\n     flanks, but it often happens that there are obstacles on other\r\n     points of the front, of such a character as to compel an attack\r\n     upon the center. Such a position will always be one of the most\r\n     advantageous for defense,--as was shown at Malplaquet and Waterloo.\r\n     Great obstacles are not essential for this purpose, as the smallest\r\n     accident of the ground is sometimes sufficient: thus, the\r\n     insignificant rivulet of Papelotte forced Ney to attack\r\n     Wellington's center, instead of the left as he had been ordered.\r\n\r\n     When a defense is made of such a position, care must be taken to\r\n     hold ready for movement portions of the wings thus covered, in\r\n     order that they may take part in the action instead of remaining\r\n     idle spectators of it.\r\n\r\nThe fact cannot be concealed, however, that all these means are but\r\npalliatives; and the best thing for an army standing on the defensive is\r\nto _know_ how to take the offensive at a proper time, and _to take it_.\r\nAmong the conditions to be satisfied by a defensive position has been\r\nmentioned that of enabling an easy and safe retreat; and this brings us\r\nto an examination of a question presented by the battle of Waterloo.\r\nWould an army with its rear resting upon a forest, and with a good road\r\nbehind the center and each wing, have its retreat compromised, as\r\nNapoleon imagined, if it should lose the battle? My own opinion is that\r\nsuch a position would be more favorable for a retreat than an entirely\r\nopen field; for a beaten army could not cross a plain without exposure\r\nto very great danger. Undoubtedly, if the retreat becomes a rout, a\r\nportion of the artillery left in battery in front of the forest would,\r\nin all probability, be lost; but the infantry and cavalry and a great\r\npart of the artillery could retire just as readily as across a plain.\r\nThere is, indeed, no better cover for an orderly retreat than a\r\nforest,--this statement being made upon the supposition that there are\r\nat least two good roads behind the line, that proper measures for\r\nretreat have been taken before the enemy has had an opportunity to press\r\ntoo closely, and, finally, that the enemy is not permitted by a flank\r\nmovement to be before the retreating army at the outlet of the forest,\r\nas was the case at Hohenlinden. The retreat would be the more secure if,\r\nas at Waterloo, the forest formed a concave line behind the center; for\r\nthis re-entering would become a place of arms to receive the troops and\r\ngive them time to pass off in succession on the main roads.\r\n\r\nWhen discussing strategic operations, mention was made of the varying\r\nchances which the two systems, the _defensive_ and the _offensive_, give\r\nrise to; and it was seen that especially in strategy the army taking the\r\ninitiative has the great advantage of bringing up its troops and\r\nstriking a blow where it may deem best, whilst the army which acts upon\r\nthe defensive and awaits an attack is anticipated in every direction, is\r\noften taken unawares, and is always obliged to regulate its movements by\r\nthose of the enemy. We have also seen that in tactics these advantages\r\nare not so marked, because in this case the operations occupy a smaller\r\nextent of ground, and the party taking the initiative cannot conceal his\r\nmovements from the enemy, who, instantly observing, may at once\r\ncounteract them by the aid of a good reserve. Moreover, the party\r\nadvancing upon the enemy has against him all the disadvantages arising\r\nfrom accidents of ground that he must pass before reaching the hostile\r\nline; and, however flat a country it may be, there are always\r\ninequalities of the surface, such as small ravines, thickets, hedges,\r\nfarm-houses, villages, &c., which must either be taken possession of or\r\nbe passed by. To these natural obstacles may also be added the enemy's\r\nbatteries to be carried, and the disorder which always prevails to a\r\ngreater or less extent in a body of men exposed to a continued fire\r\neither of musketry or artillery. Viewing the matter in the light of\r\nthese facts, all must agree that in tactical operations the advantages\r\nresulting from taking the initiative are balanced by the disadvantages.\r\n\r\nHowever undoubted these truths may be, there is another, still more\r\nmanifest, which has been demonstrated by the greatest events of history.\r\nEvery army which maintains a strictly defensive attitude must, if\r\nattacked, be at last driven from its position; whilst by profiting by\r\nall the advantages of the defensive system, and holding itself ready to\r\ntake the offensive when occasion offers, it may hope for the greatest\r\nsuccess. A general who stands motionless to receive his enemy, keeping\r\nstrictly on the defensive, may fight ever so bravely, but he must give\r\nway when properly attacked. It is not so, however, with a general who\r\nindeed waits to receive his enemy, but with the determination to fall\r\nupon him offensively at the proper moment, to wrest from him and\r\ntransfer to his own troops the moral effect always produced by an onward\r\nmovement when coupled with the certainty of throwing the main strength\r\ninto the action at the most important point,--a thing altogether\r\nimpossible when keeping strictly on the defensive. In fact, a general\r\nwho occupies a well-chosen position, where his movements are free, has\r\nthe advantage of observing the enemy's approach; his forces, previously\r\narranged in a suitable manner upon the position, aided by batteries\r\nplaced so as to produce the greatest effect, may make the enemy pay very\r\ndearly for his advance over the space separating the two armies; and\r\nwhen the assailant, after suffering severely, finds himself strongly\r\nassailed at the moment when the victory seemed to be in his hands, the\r\nadvantage will, in all probability, be his no longer, for the moral\r\neffect of such a counter-attack upon the part of an adversary supposed\r\nto be beaten is certainly enough to stagger the boldest troops.\r\n\r\nA general may, therefore, employ in his battles with equal success\r\neither the offensive or defensive system; but it is indispensable,--1st,\r\nthat, so far from limiting himself to a passive defense, he should know\r\nhow to take the offensive at favorable moments; 2d, that his\r\n_coup-d'oeil_ be certain and his coolness undoubted; 3d, that he be able\r\nto rely surely upon his troops; 4th, that, in retaking the offensive, he\r\nshould by no means neglect to apply the general principle which would\r\nhave regulated his order of battle had he done so in the beginning; 5th,\r\nthat he strike his blows upon decisive points. These truths are\r\ndemonstrated by Napoleon's course at Rivoli and Austerlitz, as well as\r\nby Wellington's at Talavera, at Salamanca, and at Waterloo.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: It is from no desire to make innovations that I have\r\nmodified old terms or made new. In the development of a science, it is\r\nwrong for the same word to designate two very different things; and, if\r\nwe continue to apply the term _order of battle_ to the disposition of\r\ntroops in line, it must be improper to designate certain important\r\nmaneuvers by the terms _oblique order of battle_, _concave order of\r\nbattle_, and it becomes necessary to use instead the terms _oblique\r\nsystem of battle_, &c.\r\n\r\nI prefer the method of designation I have adopted.

It may perhaps be said that\r\nthe courage of the defenders in the two cases was not the same; but,\r\nthrowing out of consideration this chance, it must be granted that the\r\ndifficulties of a position, when properly taken advantage of, need not\r\nbe insurmountable in order to render the attack abortive. At Elchingen\r\nthe great height and steepness of the banks, rendering the fire almost\r\nineffectual, were more disadvantageous than useful in the defense.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXXI.\r\n\r\nOffensive Battles, and Different Orders of Battle.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe understand by offensive battles those which an army fights when\r\nassaulting another in position.[24] An army reduced to the strategic\r\ndefensive often takes the offensive by making an attack, and an army\r\nreceiving an attack may, during the progress of the battle, take the\r\noffensive and obtain the advantages incident to it. History furnishes\r\nnumerous examples of battles of each of these kinds. As defensive\r\nbattles have been discussed in the preceding article, and the advantages\r\nof the defensive been pointed out, we will now proceed to the\r\nconsideration of offensive movements.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that the assailant generally has a moral advantage\r\nover the assailed, and almost always acts more understandingly than the\r\nlatter, who must be more or less in a state of uncertainty.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it is determined to attack the enemy, some order of attack\r\nmust be adopted; and that is what I have thought ought to be called\r\n_order of battle_.\r\n\r\nIt happens also quite frequently that a battle must be commenced without\r\na detailed plan, because the position of the enemy is not entirely\r\nknown. In either case it should be well understood that there is in\r\nevery battle-field a decisive point, the possession of which, more than\r\nof any other, helps to secure the victory, by enabling its holder to\r\nmake a proper application of the principles of war: arrangements should\r\ntherefore be made for striking the decisive blow upon this point.\r\n\r\nThe decisive point of a battle-field is determined, as has been already\r\nstated, by the character of the position, the bearing of different\r\nlocalities upon the strategic object in view, and, finally, by the\r\narrangement of the contending forces. For example, suppose an enemy's\r\nflank to rest upon high ground from which his whole line might be\r\nattained, the occupation of this height seems most important, tactically\r\nconsidered; but it may happen that the height in question is very\r\ndifficult of access, and situated exactly so as to be of the least\r\nimportance, strategically considered. At the battle of Bautzen the left\r\nof the allies rested upon the steep mountains of Bohemia, which province\r\nwas at that time rather neutral than hostile: it seemed that, tactically\r\nconsidered, the slope of these mountains was the decisive point to be\r\nheld, when it was just the reverse, because the allies had but one line\r\nof retreat upon Reichenbach and Gorlitz, and the French, by forcing the\r\nright, which was in the plain, would occupy this line of retreat and\r\nthrow the allies into the mountains, where they might have lost all\r\ntheir _matériel_ and a great part of the personnel of their army. This\r\ncourse was also easier for them on account of the difference in the\r\nfeatures of the ground, led to more important results, and would have\r\ndiminished the obstacles in the future.\r\n\r\nThe following truths may, I think, be deduced from what has been stated:\r\n1. The topographical key of a battle-field is not always the tactical\r\nkey; 2. The decisive point of a battle-field is certainly that which\r\ncombines strategic with topographical advantages; 3. When the\r\ndifficulties of the ground are not too formidable upon the strategic\r\npoint of the battle-field, this is generally the most important point;\r\n4. It is nevertheless true that the determination of this point depends\r\nvery much upon the arrangement of the contending forces. Thus, in lines\r\nof battle too much extended and divided the center will always be the\r\nproper point of attack; in lines well closed and connected the center is\r\nthe strongest point, since, independently of the reserves posted there,\r\nit is easy to support it from the flanks: the decisive point in this\r\ncase is therefore one of the extremities of the line. When the numerical\r\nsuperiority is considerable, an attack may be made simultaneously upon\r\nboth extremities, but not when the attacking force is equal or inferior\r\nnumerically to the enemy's. It appears, therefore, that all the\r\ncombinations of a battle consist in so employing the force in hand as to\r\nobtain the most effective action upon that one of the three points\r\nmentioned which offers the greatest number of chances of success,--a\r\npoint very easily determined by applying the analysis just mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe object of an offensive battle can only be to dislodge the enemy or\r\nto cut his line, unless it is intended by strategic maneuvers to ruin\r\nhis army completely. An enemy is dislodged either by overthrowing him at\r\nsome point of his line, or by outflanking him so as to take him in flank\r\nand rear, or by using both these methods at once; that is, attacking him\r\nin front while at the same time one wing is enveloped and his line\r\nturned.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish these different objects, it becomes necessary to make\r\nchoice of the most suitable order of battle for the method to be used.\r\n\r\nAt least twelve orders of battle may be enumerated, viz.: 1. The simple\r\nparallel order; 2. The parallel order with a defensive or offensive\r\ncrotchet; 3. The order reinforced upon one or both wings; 4. The order\r\nreinforced in the center; 5. The simple oblique order, or the oblique\r\nreinforced on the attacking wing; 6 and 7. The perpendicular order on\r\none or both wings; 8. The concave order; 9. The convex order; 10. The\r\norder by echelon on one or both wings; 11. The order by echelon on the\r\ncenter; 12. The order resulting from a strong combined attack upon the\r\ncenter and one extremity simultaneously. (See Figs. 5 to 16.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.[25]\r\n\r\nA TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT\r\n\r\n\r\n____________________________|____________________________ B ]\r\n\r\nEach of these orders may be used either by itself or, as has been\r\nstated, in connection with the maneuver of a strong column intended to\r\nturn the enemy's line. In order to a proper appreciation of the merits\r\nof each, it becomes necessary to test each by the application of the\r\ngeneral principles which have been laid down. For example, it is\r\nmanifest that the parallel order (Fig. 5) is worst of all, for it\r\nrequires no skill to fight one line against another, battalion against\r\nbattalion, with equal chances of success on either side: no tactical\r\nskill is needed in such a battle.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one important case where this is a suitable order,\r\nwhich occurs when an army, having taken the initiative in great\r\nstrategic operations, shall have succeeded in falling upon the enemy's\r\ncommunications and cutting off his line of retreat while covering its\r\nown; when the battle takes place between them, that army which has\r\nreached the rear of the other may use the parallel order, for, having\r\neffected the decisive maneuver previous to the battle, all its efforts\r\nshould now be directed toward the frustration of the enemy's endeavor to\r\nopen a way through for himself. Except for this single case, the\r\nparallel order is the worst of all. I do not mean to say that a battle\r\ncannot be gained while using this order, for one side or the other must\r\ngain the victory if the contest is continued; and the advantage will\r\nthen be upon his side who has the best troops, who best knows when to\r\nengage them, who best manages his reserve and is most favored by\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.\r\n\r\n                                       |       |\r\n                                       |       |\r\n                     A                 |       |B\r\nTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT       |\r\n                                               |\r\n______________________|________________________|\r\n                      B\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe parallel order with a crotchet upon the flank (Fig. 6) is most\r\nusually adopted in a defensive position. It may be also the result of an\r\noffensive combination; but then the crotchet is to the front, whilst in\r\nthe case of defense it is to the rear. The battle of Prague is a very\r\nremarkable example of the danger to which such a crotchet is exposed if\r\nproperly attacked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.\r\n                          A\r\nTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             ____|___\r\n             ___________________|____________________\r\n                                B            ____|___\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe parallel order reinforced upon one wing, (Fig. 7,) or upon the\r\ncenter, (Fig. 8, page 190,) to pierce that of the enemy, is much more\r\nfavorable than the two preceding ones, and is also much more in\r\naccordance with the general principles which have been laid down;\r\nalthough, when the contending forces are about equal, the part of the\r\nline which has been weakened to reinforce the other may have its own\r\nsafety compromised if placed in line parallel to the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.\r\n                         A\r\nTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT\r\n\r\n                  ________|________\r\n                  _________________\r\n                B _________________\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\nThe oblique order (Fig. 9) is the best for an inferior force attacking a\r\nsuperior; for, in addition to the advantage of bringing the main\r\nstrength of the forces against a single point of the enemy's line, it\r\nhas two others equally important, since the weakened wing is not only\r\nkept back from the attack of the enemy, but performs also the double\r\nduty of holding in position the part of his line not attacked, and of\r\nbeing at hand as a reserve for the support, if necessary, of the engaged\r\nwing. This order was used by the celebrated Epaminondas at the battles\r\nof Leuctra and Mantinea. The most brilliant example of its use in modern\r\ntimes was given by Frederick the Great at the battle of Leuthen.

The inference is that one division of the assailing army would\r\ntake a position perpendicular to the enemy's wing, whilst the remainder\r\nof the army would approach in front for the purpose of annoying him; and\r\nthis would always bring us back to one of the oblique orders shown in\r\nFigures 9 and 16.\r\n\r\nThe attack on both wings, whatever be the form of attack adopted, may be\r\nvery advantageous, but it is only admissible when the assailant is very\r\ndecidedly superior in numbers; for, if the fundamental principle is to\r\nbring the main strength of the forces upon the decisive point, a weaker\r\narmy would violate it in directing a divided attack against a superior\r\nforce. This truth will be clearly demonstrated farther on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.]\r\n\r\nThe order concave in the center (Fig. 12) has found advocates since the\r\nday when Hannibal by its use gained the battle of Cannæ. This order may\r\nindeed be very good when the progress of the battle itself gives rise to\r\nit; that is, when the enemy attacks the center, this retires before him,\r\nand he suffers himself to be enveloped by the wings. But, if this order\r\nis adopted before the battle begins, the enemy, instead of falling on\r\nthe center, has only to attack the wings, which present their\r\nextremities and are in precisely the same relative situation as if they\r\nhad been assailed in flank. This order would, therefore, be scarcely\r\never used except against an enemy who had taken the convex order to\r\nfight a battle, as will be seen farther on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12, _bis_.]\r\n\r\nAn army will rarely form a semicircle, preferring rather a broken line\r\nwith the center retired, (Fig. 12, _bis_.) If several writers may be\r\nbelieved, such an arrangement gave the victory to the English on the\r\nfamous days of Crécy and Agincourt. This order is certainly better than\r\na semicircle, since it does not so much present the flank to attack,\r\nwhilst allowing forward movement by echelon and preserving all the\r\nadvantages of concentration of fire. These advantages vanish if the\r\nenemy, instead of foolishly throwing himself upon the retired center, is\r\ncontent to watch it from a distance and makes his greatest effort upon\r\none wing. Essling, in 1809, is an example of the advantageous use of a\r\nconcave line; but it must not be inferred that Napoleon committed an\r\nerror in attacking the center; for an army fighting with the Danube\r\nbehind it and with no way of moving without uncovering its bridges of\r\ncommunication, must not be judged as if it had been free to maneuver at\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.]\r\n\r\nThe convex order with the center salient (Fig. 13) answers for an\r\nengagement immediately upon the passage of a river when the wings must\r\nbe retired and rested on the river to cover the bridges; also when a\r\ndefensive battle is to be fought with a river in rear, which is to be\r\npassed and the defile covered, as at Leipsic; and, finally, it may\r\nbecome a natural formation to resist an enemy forming a concave line. If\r\nan enemy directs his efforts against the center or against a single\r\nwing, this order might cause the ruin of the whole army.[26]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe French tried it at Fleurus in 1794, and were successful, because\r\nthe Prince of Coburg, in place of making a strong attack upon the center\r\nor upon a single extremity, divided his attack upon five or six\r\ndiverging lines, and particularly upon both wings at once. Nearly the\r\nsame convex order was adopted at Essling, and during the second and\r\nthird days of the famous battle of Leipsic. On the last occasion it had\r\njust the result that might have been expected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14\r\n                    A\r\nTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT\r\n\r\n_____                              _____\r\n    _____                      _____\r\n        _____              _____\r\n             _____  B  _____\r\n                 _______\r\n]\r\nThe order by echelon upon the two wings Fig. 14 is of the same nature as\r\nthe perpendicular order, (Fig. 11,) being, however, better than that,\r\nbecause, the echelons being nearest each other in the direction where\r\nthe reserve would be placed, the enemy would be less able, both as\r\nregards room and time, to throw himself into the interval of the center\r\nand make at that point a threatening counter-attack.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15\r\n                    A\r\nTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT\r\n\r\n                 ___|___\r\n            ___|__     __|___\r\n         _____              _____\r\n    _____B                      B_____\r\n_____                                _____\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe order by echelon on the center (Fig. 15) may be used with special\r\nsuccess against an army occupying a position too much cut up and too\r\nextended, because, its center being then somewhat isolated from the\r\nwings and liable to overthrow, the army thus cut in two would be\r\nprobably destroyed. But, applying the test of the same fundamental\r\nprinciple, this order of attack would appear to be less certain of\r\nsuccess against an army having a connected and closed line; for the\r\nreserve being generally near the center, and the wings being able to act\r\neither by concentrating their fire or by moving against the foremost\r\nechelons, might readily repulse them.\r\n\r\nIf this formation to some extent resembles the famous triangular wedge\r\nor _boar's head_ of the ancients, and the column of Winkelried, it also\r\ndiffers from them essentially; for, instead of forming one solid\r\nmass,--an impracticable thing in our day, on account of the use of\r\nartillery,--it would have a large open space in the middle, which would\r\nrender movements more easy. This formation is suitable, as has been\r\nsaid, for penetrating the center of a line too much extended, and might\r\nbe equally successful against a line unavoidably immovable; but if the\r\nwings of the attacked line are brought at a proper time against the\r\nflanks of the foremost echelons, disagreeable consequences might result.\r\nA parallel order considerably reinforced on the center might perhaps be\r\na much better arrangement, (Figs. 8 and 16;) for the parallel line in\r\nthis case would have at least the advantage of deceiving the enemy as to\r\nthe point of attack, and would hinder the wings from taking the echelons\r\nof the center by the flank.\r\n\r\nThis order by echelons was adopted by Laudon for the attack of the\r\nintrenched camp of Buntzelwitz. (Treatise on Grand Operations, chapter\r\nxxviii.) In such a case it is quite suitable; for it is then certain\r\nthat the defensive army being forced to remain within its intrenchments,\r\nthere is no danger of its attacking the echelons in flank. But, this\r\nformation having the inconvenience of indicating to the enemy the point\r\nof his line which it is desired to attack, false attacks should be made\r\nupon the wings, to mislead him as to the true point of attack.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig 16.]\r\n\r\nThe order of attack in columns on the center and on one extremity at the\r\nsame time (Fig. 16) is better than the preceding, especially in an\r\nattack upon an enemy's line strongly arranged and well connected. It may\r\neven be called the most reasonable of all the orders of battle. The\r\nattack upon the center, aided by a wing outflanking the enemy, prevents\r\nthe assailed party falling upon the assailant and taking him in flank,\r\nas was done by Hannibal and Marshal Saxe. The enemy's wing which is\r\nhemmed in between the attacks on the center and at the extremity, having\r\nto contend with nearly the entire opposing force, will be defeated and\r\nprobably destroyed. It was this maneuver which gave Napoleon his\r\nvictories of Wagram and Ligny. This was what he wished to attempt at\r\nBorodino,--where he obtained only a partial success, on account of the\r\nheroic conduct of the Russian left and the division of Paskevitch in the\r\nfamous central redoubt, and on account of the arrival of Baggavout's\r\ncorps on the wing he hoped to outflank. He used it also at\r\nBautzen,--where an unprecedented success would have been the result, but\r\nfor an accident which interfered with the maneuver of the left wing\r\nintended to cut off the allies from the road to Wurschen, every\r\narrangement having been made with that view.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that these different orders are not to be\r\nunderstood precisely as the geometrical figures indicate them. A general\r\nwho would expect to arrange his line of battle as regularly as upon\r\npaper or on a drill-ground would be greatly mistaken, and would be\r\nlikely to suffer defeat. This is particularly true as battles are now\r\nfought. In the time of Louis XIV. or of Frederick, it was possible to\r\nform lines of battle almost as regular as the geometrical figures,\r\nbecause armies camped under tents, almost always closely collected\r\ntogether, and were in presence of each other several days, thus giving\r\nample time for opening roads and clearing spaces to enable the columns\r\nto be at regular distances from each other. But in our day,--when armies\r\nbivouac, when their division into several corps gives greater mobility,\r\nwhen they take position near each other in obedience to orders given\r\nthem while out of reach of the general's eye, and often when there has\r\nbeen no time for thorough examination of the enemy's position,--finally,\r\nwhen the different arms of the service are intermingled in the line of\r\nbattle,--under these circumstances, all orders of battle which must be\r\nlaid out with great accuracy of detail are impracticable. These figures\r\nhave never been of any other use than to indicate approximate\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\nIf every army were a solid mass, capable of motion as a unit under the\r\ninfluence of one man's will and as rapidly as thought, the art of\r\nwinning battles would be reduced to choosing the most favorable order of\r\nbattle, and a general could reckon with certainty upon the success of\r\nmaneuvers arranged beforehand. But the facts are altogether different;\r\nfor the great difficulty of the tactics of battles will always be to\r\nrender certain the simultaneous entering into action of the numerous\r\nfractions whose efforts must combine to make such an attack as will give\r\ngood ground to hope for victory: in other words, the chief difficulty is\r\nto cause these fractions to unite in the execution of the decisive\r\nmaneuver which, in accordance with the original plan of the battle, is\r\nto result in victory.\r\n\r\nInaccurate transmission of orders, the manner in which they will be\r\nunderstood and executed by the subordinates of the general-in-chief,\r\nexcess of activity in some, lack of it in others, a defective\r\n_coup-d'oeil militaire_,--every thing of this kind may interfere with\r\nthe simultaneous entering into action of the different parts, without\r\nspeaking of the accidental circumstances which may delay or prevent the\r\narrival of a corps at the appointed place.\r\n\r\nHence result two undoubted truths: 1. The more simple a decisive\r\nmaneuver is, the more sure of success will it be; 2. Sudden maneuvers\r\nseasonably executed during an engagement are more likely to succeed than\r\nthose determined upon in advance, unless the latter, relating to\r\nprevious strategic movements, will bring up the columns which are to\r\ndecide the day upon those points where their presence will secure the\r\nexpected result. Waterloo and Bautzen are proofs of the last. From the\r\nmoment when Blücher and Bulow had reached the heights of Frichermont,\r\nnothing could have prevented the loss of the battle by the French, and\r\nthey could then only fight to make the defeat less complete. In like\r\nmanner, at Bautzen, as soon as Ney had reached Klix, the retreat of the\r\nallies during the night of the 20th of May could alone have saved them,\r\nfor on the 21st it was too late; and, if Ney had executed better what\r\nhe was advised to do, the victory would have been a very great one.\r\n\r\nAs to maneuvers for breaking through a line and calculations upon the\r\nco-operation of columns proceeding from the general front of the army,\r\nwith the intention of effecting large detours around an enemy's flank,\r\nit may be stated that their result is always doubtful, since it depends\r\nupon such an accurate execution of carefully-arranged plans as is rarely\r\nseen. This subject will be considered in Art. XXXII.\r\n\r\nBesides the difficulty of depending upon the exact application of an\r\norder of battle arranged in advance, it often happens that battles begin\r\nwithout even the assailant having a well-defined object, although the\r\ncollision may have been expected. This uncertainty results either from\r\ncircumstances prior to the battle, from ignorance of the enemy's\r\nposition and plans, or from the fact that a portion of the army may be\r\nstill expected to arrive on the field.\r\n\r\nFrom these things many people have concluded that it is impossible to\r\nreduce to different systems the formations of orders of battle, or that\r\nthe adoption of either of them can at all influence the result of an\r\nengagement,--an erroneous conclusion, in my opinion, even in the cases\r\ncited above. Indeed, in battles begun without any predetermined plan it\r\nis probable that at the opening of the engagement the armies will occupy\r\nlines nearly parallel and more or less strengthened upon some point; the\r\nparty acting upon the defensive, not knowing in what quarter the storm\r\nwill burst upon him, will hold a large part of his forces in reserve, to\r\nbe used as occasion may require; the assailant must make similar efforts\r\nto have his forces well in hand; but as soon as the point of attack\r\nshall have been determined, the mass of his troops will be directed\r\nagainst the center or upon one wing of the enemy, or upon both at once.\r\nWhatever may be the resulting formation, it will always bear a\r\nresemblance to one of the figures previously exhibited. Even in\r\nunexpected engagements the same thing would happen,--which will, it is\r\nhoped, be a sufficient proof of the fact that this classification of the\r\ndifferent systems or orders of battle is neither fanciful nor useless.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing even in Napoleon's battles which disproves my\r\nassertion, although they are less susceptible than any others of being\r\nrepresented by lines accurately laid down. We see him, however, at\r\nRivoli, at Austerlitz, and at Ratisbon, concentrating his forces toward\r\nthe center to be ready at the favorable moment to fall upon the enemy.\r\nAt the Pyramids he formed an oblique line of squares in echelon. At\r\nLeipsic, Essling, and Brienne he used a kind of convex order very like\r\nFig. 11. At Wagram his order was altogether like Fig. 16, bringing up\r\ntwo masses upon the center and right, while keeping back the left wing;\r\nand this he wished to repeat at Borodino and at Waterloo before the\r\nPrussians came up. At Eylau, although the collision was almost entirely\r\nunforeseen on account of the very unexpected return and offensive\r\nmovement of the Russians, he outflanked their left almost\r\nperpendicularly, whilst in another direction he was endeavoring to break\r\nthrough the center; but these attacks were not simultaneous, that on the\r\ncenter being repulsed at eleven o'clock, whilst Davoust did not attack\r\nvigorously upon the left until toward one. At Dresden he attacked by the\r\ntwo wings, for the first time probably in his life, because his center\r\nwas covered by a fortification and an intrenched camp, and, in addition,\r\nthe attack of his left was combined with that of Vandamme upon the\r\nenemy's line of retreat. At Marengo, if we may credit Napoleon himself,\r\nthe oblique order he assumed, resting his right at Castel Ceriole, saved\r\nhim from almost inevitable defeat. Ulm and Jena were battles won by\r\nstrategy before they were fought, tactics having but little to do with\r\nthem. At Ulm there was not even a regular battle.\r\n\r\nI think we may hence conclude that if it seems absurd to desire to mark\r\nout upon the ground orders of battle in such regular lines as would be\r\nused in tracing them on a sketch, a skillful general may nevertheless\r\nbear in mind the orders which have been indicated above, and may so\r\ncombine his troops on the battle-field that the arrangement shall be\r\nsimilar to one of them. He should endeavor in all his combinations,\r\nwhether deliberately arranged or adopted on the spur of the moment, to\r\nform a sound conclusion as to the important point of the battle-field;\r\nand this he can only do by observing well the direction of the enemy's\r\nline of battle, and not forgetting the direction in which strategy\r\nrequires him to operate. He will then give his attention and efforts to\r\nthis point, using a third of his force to keep the enemy in check or\r\nwatch his movements, while throwing the other two-thirds upon the point\r\nthe possession of which will insure him the victory. Acting thus, he\r\nwill have satisfied all the conditions the science of grand tactics can\r\nimpose upon him, and will have applied the principles of the art in the\r\nmost perfect manner. The manner of determining the decisive point of a\r\nbattle-field has been described in the preceding chapter, (Art. XIX.)\r\n\r\nHaving now explained the twelve orders of battle, it has occurred to me\r\nthat this would be a proper place to reply to several statements made in\r\nthe Memoirs of Napoleon published by General Montholon.\r\n\r\nThe great captain seems to consider the oblique order a modern\r\ninvention, a theorist's fancy,--an opinion I can by no means share; for\r\nthe oblique order is as old as Thebes and Sparta, and I have seen it\r\nused with my own eyes. This assertion of Napoleon's seems the more\r\nremarkable because Napoleon himself boasted of having used, at Marengo,\r\nthe very order of which he thus denies the existence.\r\n\r\nIf we understand that the oblique order is to be applied in the rigid\r\nand precise manner inculcated by General Ruchel at the Berlin school.\r\nNapoleon was certainly right in regarding it as an absurdity; but I\r\nrepeat that a line of battle never was a regular geometrical figure, and\r\nwhen such figures are used in discussing the combinations of tactics it\r\ncan only be for the purpose of giving definite expression to an idea by\r\nthe use of a known symbol. It is nevertheless true that every line of\r\nbattle which is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the enemy's must\r\nbe oblique of necessity. If one army attacks the extremity of another\r\narmy, the attacking wing being reinforced by massing troops upon it\r\nwhile the weakened wing is kept retired from attack, the direction of\r\nthe line must of necessity be a little oblique, since one end of it\r\nwill be nearer the enemy than the other. The oblique order is so far\r\nfrom being a mere fancy that we see it used when the order is that by\r\nechelons on one wing, (Fig. 14.)\r\n\r\nAs to the other orders of battle explained above, it cannot be denied\r\nthat at Essling and Fleurus the general arrangement of the Austrians was\r\na concave line, and that of the French a convex. In these orders\r\nparallel lines may be used as in the case of straight lines, and they\r\nwould be classified as belonging to the parallel system when no part of\r\nthe line was more strongly occupied or drawn up nearer to the enemy than\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nLaying aside for the present further consideration of these geometrical\r\nfigures, it is to be observed that, for the purpose of fighting battles\r\nin a truly scientific manner, the following points must be attended\r\nto:--\r\n\r\n     1. An offensive order of battle should have for its object to force\r\n     the enemy from his position by all reasonable means.\r\n\r\n     2. The maneuvers indicated by art are those intended to overwhelm\r\n     one wing only, or the center and one wing at the same time. An\r\n     enemy may also be dislodged by maneuvers for outflanking and\r\n     turning his position.\r\n\r\n     3. These attempts have a much greater probability of success if\r\n     concealed from the enemy until the very moment of the assault.\r\n\r\n     4. To attack the center and both wings at the same time, without\r\n     having very superior forces, would be entirely in opposition to the\r\n     rules of the art, unless one of these attacks can be made very\r\n     strongly without weakening the line too much at the other points.\r\n\r\n     5. The oblique order has no other object than to unite at least\r\n     half the force of the army in an overwhelming attack upon one wing,\r\n     while the remainder is retired to the rear, out of danger of\r\n     attack, being arranged either in echelon or in a single oblique\r\n     line.\r\n\r\n     6 The different formations, convex, concave, perpendicular, or\r\n     otherwise, may all be varied by having the lines of uniform\r\n     strength throughout, or by massing troops at one point.\r\n\r\n     7. The object of the defense being to defeat the plans of the\r\n     attacking party, the arrangements of a defensive order should be\r\n     such as to multiply the difficulties of approaching the position,\r\n     and to keep in hand a strong reserve, well concealed, and ready to\r\n     fall at the decisive moment upon a point where the enemy least\r\n     expect to meet it.\r\n\r\n     8. It is difficult to state with precision what is the best method\r\n     to use in forcing a hostile army to abandon its position. An order\r\n     of battle would be perfect which united the double advantages of\r\n     the fire of the arms and of the moral effect produced by an onset.\r\n     A skillful mixture of deployed lines and columns, acting\r\n     alternately as circumstances require, will always be a good\r\n     combination. In the practical use of this system many variations\r\n     must arise from differences in the _coup-d'oeil_ of commanders, the\r\n     _morale_ of officers and soldiers, their familiarity with maneuvers\r\n     and firings of all sorts, from varying localities, &c.\r\n\r\n     9. As it is essential in an offensive battle to drive the enemy\r\n     from his position and to cut him up as much as possible, the best\r\n     means of accomplishing this is to use as much material force as can\r\n     be accumulated against him. It sometimes happens, however, that the\r\n     direct application of main force is of doubtful utility, and better\r\n     results may follow from maneuvers to outflank and turn that wing\r\n     which is nearest the enemy's line of retreat. He may when thus\r\n     threatened retire, when he would fight strongly and successfully if\r\n     attacked by main force.\r\n\r\n     History is full of examples of the success of such maneuvers,\r\n     especially when used against generals of weak character; and,\r\n     although victories thus obtained are generally less decisive and\r\n     the hostile army is but little demoralized, such incomplete\r\n     successes are of sufficient importance not to be neglected, and a\r\n     skillful general should know how to employ the means to gain them\r\n     when opportunity offers, and especially should he combine these\r\n     turning movements with attacks by main force.\r\n\r\n     10. The combination of these two methods--that is to say, the\r\n     attack in front by main force and the turning maneuver--will render\r\n     the victory more certain than the use of either separately; but,\r\n     in all cases, too extended movements must be avoided, even in\r\n     presence of a contemptible enemy.\r\n\r\n     11. The manner of driving an enemy from his position by main force\r\n     is the following:--Throw his troops into confusion by a heavy and\r\n     well-directed fire of artillery, increase this confusion by\r\n     vigorous charges of cavalry, and follow up the advantages thus\r\n     gained by pushing forward masses of infantry well covered in front\r\n     by skirmishers and flanked by cavalry.\r\n\r\n     But, while we may expect success to follow such an attack upon the\r\n     first line, the second is still to be overcome, and, after that,\r\n     the reserve; and at this period of the engagement the attacking\r\n     party would usually be seriously embarrassed, did not the moral\r\n     effect of the defeat of the first line often occasion the retreat\r\n     of the second and cause the general in command to lose his presence\r\n     of mind. In fact, the attacking troops will usually be somewhat\r\n     disordered, even in victory, and it will often be very difficult to\r\n     replace them by those of the second line, because they generally\r\n     follow the first line at such a distance as not to come within\r\n     musket-range of the enemy; and it is always embarrassing to\r\n     substitute one division for another in the heat of battle, at the\r\n     moment when the enemy is putting forth all his strength in\r\n     repelling the attack.\r\n\r\n     These considerations lead to the belief that if the general and the\r\n     troops of the defensive army are equally active in the performance\r\n     of their duty, and preserve their presence of mind, if their flanks\r\n     and line of retreat are not threatened, the advantage will usually\r\n     be on their side at the second collision of the battle; but to\r\n     insure that result their second line and the cavalry must be\r\n     launched against the victorious battalions of the adversary at the\r\n     proper instant; for the loss of a few minutes may be irreparable,\r\n     and the second line may be drawn into the confusion of the first.\r\n\r\n     12. From the preceding facts may be deduced the following truth:\r\n     \"that the most difficult as well as the most certain of all the\r\n     means the assailant may use to gain the victory consists in\r\n     strongly supporting the first line with the troops of the second\r\n     line, and these with the reserve, and in a proper employment of\r\n     masses of cavalry and of batteries, to assist in striking the\r\n     decisive blow at the second line of the enemy; for here is\r\n     presented the greatest of all the problems of the tactics of\r\n     battles.\"\r\n\r\n     In this important crisis of battles, theory becomes an uncertain\r\n     guide; for it is then unequal to the emergency, and can never\r\n     compare in value with a natural talent for war, nor be a sufficient\r\n     substitute for that intuitive _coup-d'oeil_ imparted by experience\r\n     in battles to a general of tried bravery and coolness.\r\n\r\n     The simultaneous employment of the largest number of troops of all\r\n     arms combined, except a small reserve of each which should be\r\n     always held in hand,[27] will, therefore, at the critical moment of\r\n     the battle, be the problem which every skillful general will\r\n     attempt to solve and to which he should give his whole attention.\r\n     This critical moment is usually when the first line of the parties\r\n     is broken, and all the efforts of both contestants are put\r\n     forth,--on the one side to complete the victory, on the other to\r\n     wrest it from the enemy. It is scarcely necessary to say that, to\r\n     make this decisive blow more certain and effectual, a simultaneous\r\n     attack upon the enemy's flank would be very advantageous.\r\n\r\n     13. In the defensive the fire of musketry can be much more\r\n     effectively used than in the offensive, since when a position is to\r\n     be carried it can be accomplished only by moving upon it, and\r\n     marching and firing at the same time can be done only by troops as\r\n     skirmishers, being an impossibility for the principal masses. The\r\n     object of the defense being to break and throw into confusion the\r\n     troops advancing to the attack, the fire of artillery and musketry\r\n     will be the natural defensive means of the first line, and when the\r\n     enemy presses too closely the columns of the second line and part\r\n     of the cavalry must be launched against him. There will then be a\r\n     strong probability of his repulse.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: In every battle one party must be the assailant and the\r\nother assailed. Every battle is hence offensive for one party and\r\ndefensive for the other.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: The letter A in this and other figures of the twelve\r\norders indicates the defensive army, and B the offensive. The armies are\r\nrepresented each in a single line, in order not to complicate the\r\nfigures too much; but it should be observed that every order of battle\r\nought to be in two lines, whether the troops are deployed in columns of\r\nattack, in squares, or checkerwise.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: An attack upon the two extremities might succeed also in\r\nsome cases, either when the force was strong enough to try it, or the\r\nenemy was unable to weaken his center to support the wings. As a rule, a\r\nfalse attack to engage the center, and a strong attack against one\r\nextremity, would be the best method to use against such a line.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: The great reserves must, of course, be also engaged when\r\nit is necessary; but it is always a good plan to keep back, as a final\r\nreserve, two or three battalions and five or six squadrons. Moreau\r\ndecided the battle of Engen with four companies of infantry; and what\r\nKellermann's cavalry accomplished at Marengo is known to every reader of\r\nhistory.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXXII.\r\n\r\nTurning Maneuvers, and too extended Movement in Battles.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have spoken in the preceding article of maneuvers undertaken to turn\r\nan enemy's line upon the battle-field, and of the advantages which may\r\nbe expected from them. A few words remain to be said as to the wide\r\ndétours which these maneuvers sometimes occasion, causing the failure of\r\nso many plans seemingly well arranged.\r\n\r\nIt may be laid down as a principle that any movement is dangerous which\r\nis so extended as to give the enemy an opportunity, while it is taking\r\nplace, of beating the remainder of the army in position. Nevertheless,\r\nas the danger depends very much upon the rapid and certain _coup-d'oeil_\r\nof the opposing general, as well as upon the style of warfare to which\r\nhe is accustomed, it is not difficult to understand why so many\r\nmaneuvers of this kind have failed against some commanders and succeeded\r\nagainst others, and why such a movement which would have been hazardous\r\nin presence of Frederick, Napoleon, or Wellington might have entire\r\nsuccess against a general of limited capacity, who had not the tact to\r\ntake the offensive himself at the proper moment, or who might himself\r\nhave been in the habit of moving in this manner.\r\n\r\nIt seems, therefore, difficult to lay down a fixed rule on the subject.\r\nThe following directions are all that can be given. Keep the mass of the\r\nforce well in hand and ready to act at the proper moment, being careful,\r\nhowever, to avoid the danger of accumulating troops in too large bodies.\r\nA commander observing these precautions will be always prepared for any\r\nthing that may happen. If the opposing general shows little skill and\r\nseems inclined to indulge in extended movements, his adversary may be\r\nmore daring.\r\n\r\nA few examples drawn from history will serve to convince the reader of\r\nthe truth of my statements, and to show him how the results of these\r\nextended movements depend upon the characters of the generals and the\r\narmies concerned in them.\r\n\r\nIn the Seven Years' War, Frederick gained the battle of Prague because\r\nthe Austrians had left a feebly-defended interval of one thousand yards\r\nbetween their right and the remainder of their army,--the latter part\r\nremaining motionless while the right was overwhelmed. This inaction was\r\nthe more extraordinary as the left of the Austrians had a much shorter\r\ndistance to pass over in order to support their right than Frederick had\r\nto attack it; for the right was in the form of a crotchet, and Frederick\r\nwas obliged to move on the arc of a large semicircle to reach it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Frederick came near losing the battle of Torgau,\r\nbecause he made with his left a movement entirely too extended and\r\ndisconnected (nearly six miles) with a view of turning the right of\r\nMarshal Daun.[28] Mollendorf brought up the right by a concentric\r\nmovement to the heights of Siptitz, where he rejoined the king, whose\r\nline was thus reformed.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Rivoli is a noted instance in point. All who are familiar\r\nwith that battle know that Alvinzi and his chief of staff Weyrother\r\nwished to surround Napoleon's little army, which was concentrated on the\r\nplateau of Rivoli. Their center was beaten,--while their left was piled\r\nup in the ravine of the Adige, and Lusignan with their right was making\r\na wide _détour_ to get upon the rear of the French army, where he was\r\nspeedily surrounded and captured.\r\n\r\nNo one can forget the day of Stockach, where Jourdan conceived the\r\nunfortunate idea of causing an attack to be made upon a united army of\r\nsixty thousand men by three small divisions of seven thousand or eight\r\nthousand men, separated by distances of several leagues, whilst\r\nSaint-Cyr, with the third of the army, (thirteen thousand men,) was to\r\npass twelve miles beyond the right flank and get in rear of this army of\r\nsixty thousand men, which could not help being victorious over these\r\ndivided fractions, and should certainly have captured the part in their\r\nrear. Saint-Cyr's escape was indeed little less than a miracle.\r\n\r\nWe may call to mind how this same General Weyrother, who had desired to\r\nsurround Napoleon at Rivoli, attempted the same maneuver at Austerlitz,\r\nin spite of the severe lesson he had formerly received. The left wing of\r\nthe allied army, wishing to outflank Napoleon's right, to cut him off\r\nfrom Vienna, (where he did not desire to return,) by a circular movement\r\nof nearly six miles, opened an interval of a mile and a half in their\r\nline. Napoleon took advantage of this mistake, fell upon the center, and\r\nsurrounded their left, which was completely shut up between Lakes\r\nTellnitz and Melnitz.\r\n\r\nWellington gained the battle of Salamanca by a maneuver very similar to\r\nNapoleon's, because Marmont, who wished to cut off his retreat to\r\nPortugal, left an opening of a mile and a half in his line,--seeing\r\nwhich, the English general entirely defeated his left wing, that had no\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nIf Weyrother had been opposed to Jourdan at Rivoli or at Austerlitz, he\r\nmight have destroyed the French army, instead of suffering in each case\r\na total defeat; for the general who at Stockach attacked a mass of sixty\r\nthousand men with four small bodies of troops so much separated as to be\r\nunable to give mutual aid would not have known how to take proper\r\nadvantage of a wide detour effected in his presence. In the same way,\r\nMarmont was unfortunate in having at Salamanca an adversary whose chief\r\nmerit was a rapid and practiced tactical _coup-d'oeil_. With the Duke of\r\nYork or Moore for an antagonist, Marmont would probably have been\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nAmong the turning maneuvers which have succeeded in our day, Waterloo\r\nand Hohenlinden had the most brilliant results. Of these the first was\r\nalmost altogether a strategic operation, and was attended with a rare\r\nconcurrence of fortunate circumstances. As to Hohenlinden, we will\r\nsearch in vain in military history for another example of a single\r\nbrigade venturing into a forest in the midst of fifty thousand enemies,\r\nand there performing such astonishing feats as Richepanse effected in\r\nthe defile of Matenpoet, where he might have expected, in all\r\nprobability, to lay down his arms.\r\n\r\nAt Wagram the turning wing under Davoust contributed greatly to the\r\nsuccessful issue of the day; but, if the vigorous attack upon the center\r\nunder Macdonald, Oudinot, and Bernadotte had not rendered opportune\r\nassistance, it is by no means certain that a like success would have\r\nbeen the result.\r\n\r\nSo many examples of conflicting results might induce the conclusion that\r\nno rule on this subject can be given; but this would be erroneous; for\r\nit seems, on the contrary, quite evident that, by adopting as a rule an\r\norder of battle well closed and well connected, a general will find\r\nhimself prepared for any emergency, and little will be left to chance;\r\nbut it is specially important for him to have a correct estimate of his\r\nenemy's character and his usual style of warfare, to enable him to\r\nregulate his own actions accordingly. In case of superiority in numbers\r\nor discipline, maneuvers may be attempted which would be imprudent were\r\nthe forces equal or the commanders of the same capacity. A maneuver to\r\noutflank and turn a wing should be connected with other attacks, and\r\nopportunely supported by an attempt of the remainder of the army on the\r\nenemy's front, either against the wing turned or against the center.\r\nFinally, strategic operations to cut an enemy's line of communications\r\nbefore giving battle, and attack him in rear, the assailing army\r\npreserving its own line of retreat, are much more likely to be\r\nsuccessful and effectual, and, moreover, they require no disconnected\r\nmaneuver during the battle.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: For an account of these two battles, see Chapters II. and\r\nXXV. of the Treatise on Grand Military Operations.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXXIII.\r\n\r\nUnexpected Meeting of Two Armies on the March.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accidental and unexpected meeting of two armies on the march gives\r\nrise to one of the most imposing scenes in war.\r\n\r\nIn the greater number of battles, one party awaits his enemy in a\r\nposition chosen in advance, which is attacked after a reconnoissance as\r\nclose and accurate as possible. It often happens, however,--especially\r\nas war is now carried on,--that two armies approach each other, each\r\nintending to make an unexpected attack upon the other. A collision\r\nensues unexpected by both armies, since each finds the other where it\r\ndoes not anticipate a meeting. One army may also be attacked by another\r\nwhich has prepared a surprise for it,--as happened to the French at\r\nRossbach.\r\n\r\nA great occasion of this kind calls into play all the genius of a\r\nskillful general and of the warrior able to control events. It is always\r\npossible to gain a battle with brave troops, even where the commander\r\nmay not have great capacity; but victories like those of Lutzen,\r\nLuzzara, Eylau, Abensberg, can only be gained by a brilliant genius\r\nendowed with great coolness and using the wisest combinations.\r\n\r\nThere is so much chance in these accidental battles that it is by no\r\nmeans easy to lay down precise rules concerning them; but these are the\r\nvery cases in which it is necessary to keep clearly before the mind the\r\nfundamental principles of the art and the different methods of applying\r\nthem, in order to a proper arrangement of maneuvers that must be decided\r\nupon at the instant and in the midst of the crash of resounding arms.\r\n\r\nTwo armies marching, as they formerly did, with all their camp-equipage,\r\nand meeting unexpectedly, could do nothing better at first than cause\r\ntheir advanced guard to deploy to the right or left of the roads they\r\nare traversing. In each army the forces should at the same time be\r\nconcentrated so that they may be thrown in a proper direction\r\nconsidering the object of the march. A grave error would be committed in\r\ndeploying the whole army behind the advanced guard; because, even if the\r\ndeployment were accomplished, the result would be nothing more than a\r\nbadly-arranged parallel order, and if the enemy pressed the advanced\r\nguard with considerable vigor the consequence might be the rout of the\r\ntroops which were forming. (See the account of the battle of Rossbach,\r\nTreatise on Grand Operations.)\r\n\r\nIn the modern system, when armies are more easily moved, marching upon\r\nseveral roads, and divided into masses which may act independently,\r\nthese routs are not so much to be feared; but the principles are\r\nunchanged. The advanced guard must always be halted and formed, and then\r\nthe mass of the troops concentrated in that direction which is best\r\nsuited for carrying out the object of the march. Whatever maneuvers the\r\nenemy may then attempt, every thing will be in readiness to meet him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXXIV.\r\n\r\nOf Surprises of Armies.\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall not speak here of surprises of small detachments,--the chief\r\nfeatures in the wars of partisan or light troops, for which the light\r\nRussian and Turkish cavalry are so well adapted. I shall confine myself\r\nto an examination of the surprise of whole armies.\r\n\r\nBefore the invention of fire-arms, surprises were more easily effected\r\nthan at present; for the reports of artillery and musketry firing are\r\nheard to so great a distance that the surprise of an army is now next to\r\nan impossibility, unless the first duties of field-service are forgotten\r\nand the enemy is in the midst of the army before his presence is known\r\nbecause there are no outposts to give the alarm. The Seven Years' War\r\npresents a memorable example in the surprise of Hochkirch. It shows that\r\na surprise does not consist simply in falling upon troops that are\r\nsleeping or keeping a poor look-out, but that it may result from the\r\ncombination of a sudden attack upon, and a surrounding of, one extremity\r\nof the army. In fact, to surprise an army it is not necessary to take it\r\nso entirely unawares that the troops will not even have emerged from\r\ntheir tents, but it is sufficient to attack it in force at the point\r\nintended, before preparations can be made to meet the attack.\r\n\r\nAs armies at the present day seldom camp in tents when on a march,\r\nprearranged surprises are rare and difficult, because in order to plan\r\none it becomes necessary to have an accurate knowledge of the enemy's\r\ncamp. At Marengo, at Lutzen, and at Eylau there was something like a\r\nsurprise; but this term should only be applied to an entirely unexpected\r\nattack. The only great surprise to be cited is the case of Taroutin, in\r\n1812, where Murat was attacked and beaten by Benningsen. To excuse his\r\nimprudence, Murat pretended that a secret armistice was in force; but\r\nthere was really nothing of the kind, and he was surprised through his\r\nown negligence.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the most favorable manner of attacking an army is to\r\nfall upon its camp just before daybreak, at the moment when nothing of\r\nthe sort is expected. Confusion in the camp will certainly take place;\r\nand, if the assailant has an accurate knowledge of the locality and can\r\ngive a suitable tactical and strategic direction to the mass of his\r\nforces, he may expect a complete success, unless unforeseen events\r\noccur. This is an operation by no means to be despised in war, although\r\nit is rare, and less brilliant than a great strategic combination which\r\nrenders the victory certain even before the battle is fought.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason that advantage should be taken of all opportunities\r\nfor surprising an adversary, the necessary precautions should be used to\r\nprevent such attacks. The regulations for the government of any\r\nwell-organized army should point out the means for doing the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXXV.\r\n\r\nOf the Attack by Main Force of Fortified Places, Intrenched Camps or\r\nLines.--Of Coups de Main in General.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many fortified places which, although not regular fortresses,\r\nare regarded as secure against _coups de main_, but may nevertheless be\r\ncarried by escalade or assault, or through breaches not altogether\r\npracticable, but so steep as to require the use of ladders or some other\r\nmeans of getting to the parapet.\r\n\r\nThe attack of a place of this kind presents nearly the same combinations\r\nas that of an intrenched camp; for both belong to the class of _coups de\r\nmain_.\r\n\r\nThis kind of attack will vary with circumstances: 1st, with the strength\r\nof the works; 2d, with the character of the ground on which they are\r\nbuilt; 3d, with the fact of their being isolated or connected; 4th, with\r\nthe morale of the respective parties. History gives us examples of all\r\nof these varieties.\r\n\r\nFor examples, take the intrenched camps of Kehl, Dresden, and Warsaw,\r\nthe lines of Turin and Mayence, the intrenchments of Feldkirch,\r\nScharnitz, and Assiette. Here I have mentioned several cases, each with\r\nvarying circumstances and results. At Kehl (1796) the intrenchments were\r\nbetter connected and better constructed than at Warsaw. There was, in\r\nfact, a _tête de pont_ nearly equal to a permanent fortification; for\r\nthe archduke thought himself obliged to besiege it in form, and it would\r\nhave been extremely hazardous for him to make an open attack upon it. At\r\nWarsaw the works were isolated, but of considerable relief, and they had\r\nas a keep a large city surrounded by loopholed walls, armed and defended\r\nby a number of desperate men.\r\n\r\nDresden, in 1813, had for a keep a bastioned enceinte, one front of\r\nwhich, however, was dismantled and had no other parapet than such as was\r\nsuited to a field-work. The camp proper was protected by simple\r\nredoubts, at considerable distances apart, very poorly built, the keep\r\ngiving it its sole strength.[29]\r\n\r\nAt Mayence and at Turin there were continuous lines of circumvallation;\r\nbut if in the first case they were strong, they were certainly not so at\r\nTurin, where upon one of the important points there was an insignificant\r\nparapet with a command of three feet, and a ditch proportionally deep.\r\nIn the latter case, also, the lines were between two fires, as they were\r\nattacked in rear by a strong garrison at the moment when Prince Eugene\r\nassailed them from without. At Mayence the lines were attacked in front,\r\nonly a small detachment having succeeded in passing around the right\r\nflank.\r\n\r\nThe tactical measures to be taken in the attack of field-works are few\r\nin number. If it seems probable that a work may be surprised if attacked\r\na little before day, it is altogether proper to make the attempt; but if\r\nthis operation may be recommended in case of an isolated work, it is by\r\nno means to be expected that a large army occupying an intrenched camp\r\nwill permit itself to be surprised,--especially as the regulations of\r\nall services require armies to stand to their arms at dawn. As an attack\r\nby main force seems likely to be the method followed in this case, the\r\nfollowing simple and reasonable directions are laid down:--\r\n\r\n     1. Silence the guns of the work by a powerful artillery-fire,\r\n     which at the same time has the effect of discouraging the\r\n     defenders.\r\n\r\n     2. Provide for the troops all the materials necessary (such as\r\n     fascines and short ladders) to enable them to pass the ditch and\r\n     mount the parapet.\r\n\r\n     3. Direct three small columns upon the work to be taken,\r\n     skirmishers preceding them, and reserves being at hand for their\r\n     support.\r\n\r\n     4. Take advantage of every irregularity of the ground to get cover\r\n     for the troops, and keep them sheltered as long as possible.\r\n\r\n     5. Give detailed instructions to the principal columns as to their\r\n     duties when a work shall have been carried, and as to the manner of\r\n     attacking the troops occupying the camp. Designate the bodies of\r\n     cavalry which are to assist in attacking those troops if the ground\r\n     permits. When all these arrangements are made, there is nothing\r\n     more to be done but to bring up the troops to the attack as\r\n     actively as possible, while a detachment makes an attempt at the\r\n     gorge. Hesitancy and delay in such a case are worse than the most\r\n     daring rashness.\r\n\r\nThose gymnastic exercises are very useful which prepare soldiers for\r\nescalades and passing obstacles; and the engineers may with great\r\nadvantage give their attention to providing means for facilitating the\r\npassage of the ditches of field-works and climbing their parapets.\r\n\r\nAmong all the arrangements in cases of this kind of which I have read,\r\nnone are better than those for the assault of Warsaw and the intrenched\r\ncamp of Mayence. Thielke gives a description of Laudon's dispositions\r\nfor attacking the camp of Buntzelwitz, which, although not executed, is\r\nan excellent example for instruction. The attack of Warsaw may be cited\r\nas one of the finest operations of this sort, and does honor to Marshal\r\nPaskevitch and the troops who executed it. As an example not to be\r\nfollowed, no better can be given than the arrangements made for\r\nattacking Dresden in 1813.\r\n\r\nAmong attacks of this class may be mentioned the memorable assaults or\r\nescalades of Port Mahon in 1756, and of Berg-op-zoom in 1747,--both\r\npreceded by sieges, but still brilliant _coups de main_, since in\r\nneither case was the breach sufficiently large for a regular assault.\r\n\r\nContinuous intrenched lines, although seeming to have a better\r\ninterconnection than lines of detached works, are more easily carried,\r\nbecause they may be several leagues in extent, and it is almost\r\nimpossible to prevent an enemy from breaking through them at some point.\r\nThe capture of the lines of Mayence and Wissembourg, which are described\r\nin the History of the Wars of the Revolution, (Chapters XXI. and XXII.,)\r\nand that of the lines of Turin by Eugene of Savoy in 1706, are excellent\r\nlessons for study.\r\n\r\nThis famous event at Turin, which has been so often referred to, is so\r\nfamiliar to all readers that it is unnecessary to recall the details of\r\nit; but I cannot pass it by without remarking how easily the victory was\r\nbought and how little it should have been expected. The strategic plan\r\nwas certainly admirable; and the march from the Adige through Piacenza\r\nto Asti by the right bank of the Po, leaving the French on the Mincio,\r\nwas beautifully arranged, but its execution was exceedingly slow. When\r\nwe examine the operations near Turin, we must confess that the victors\r\nowed more to their good fortune than to their wisdom. It required no\r\ngreat effort of genius upon the part of Prince Eugene to prepare the\r\norder he issued to his army; and he must have felt a profound contempt\r\nfor his opponents to execute a march with thirty-five thousand allied\r\ntroops of ten different nations between eighty thousand Frenchmen on the\r\none side and the Alps on the other, and to pass around their camp for\r\nforty-eight hours by the most remarkable flank march that was ever\r\nattempted. The order for the attack was so brief and so devoid of\r\ninstruction that any staff officer of the present day ought to write a\r\nbetter. Directing the formation of eight columns of infantry by brigade\r\nin two lines, giving them orders to carry the intrenchments and to make\r\nopenings through them for the passage of the cavalry into the camp, make\r\nup the sum total of all the science exhibited by Eugene in order to\r\ncarry out his rash undertaking It is true he selected the weak point of\r\nthe intrenchment; for it was there so low that it covered only half the\r\nbodies of its defenders.\r\n\r\nBut I am wandering from my subject, and must return to the explanation\r\nof the measures most suitable for adoption in an attack on lines. If\r\nthey have a sufficient relief to make it difficult to carry them by\r\nassault, and if on the other hand they may be outflanked or turned by\r\nstrategic maneuvers, it is far better to pursue the course last\r\nindicated than to attempt a hazardous assault. If, however, there is any\r\nreason for preferring the attack by assault, it should be made upon one\r\nof the wings, because the center is the point most easily succored.\r\nThere have been cases where an attack on the wing was expected by the\r\ndefenders, and they have been deceived by a false attack made at that\r\npoint, while the real attack took place at the center, and succeeded\r\nsimply because unexpected. In these operations the locality and the\r\ncharacter of the generals engaged must decide as to the proper course to\r\nbe pursued.\r\n\r\nThe attack may be executed in the manner described for intrenched camps.\r\nIt has sometimes happened, however, that these lines have had the relief\r\nand proportions of permanent works; and in this case escalade would be\r\nquite difficult, except of old earthen works whose slopes were worn away\r\nfrom the lapse of time and had become accessible for infantry of\r\nmoderate activity. The ramparts of Ismail and Praga were of this\r\ncharacter; so also was the citadel of Smolensk, which Paskevitch so\r\ngloriously defended against Ney, because he preferred making his stand\r\nat the ravines in front, rather than take shelter behind a parapet with\r\nan inclination of scarcely thirty degrees.\r\n\r\nIf one extremity of a line rests upon a river, it seems absurd to think\r\nof penetrating upon that wing, because the enemy collecting his forces,\r\nthe mass of which would be near the center, might defeat the columns\r\nadvancing between the center and the river and completely destroy them.\r\nThis absurdity, however, has sometimes been successful; because the\r\nenemy driven behind his lines rarely thinks of making an offensive\r\nreturn upon the assailant, no matter how advantageous it might seem. A\r\ngeneral and soldiers who seek refuge behind lines are already half\r\nconquered, and the idea of taking the offensive does not occur to them\r\nwhen their intrenchments are attacked. Notwithstanding these facts, I\r\ncannot advise such a course; and the general who would run such a risk\r\nand meet the fate of Tallard at Blenheim could have no just cause of\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\nVery few directions can be given for the defense of intrenched camps and\r\nlines. The first is to be sure of having strong reserves placed between\r\nthe center and each wing, or, to speak more accurately, on the right of\r\nthe left wing and on the left of the right wing. With this arrangement\r\nsuccor can be easily and rapidly carried to a threatened point, which\r\ncould not be done were there but one central reserve. It has been\r\nsuggested that three reserves would not be too many if the intrenchment\r\nis very extensive; but I decidedly incline to the opinion that two are\r\nquite enough. Another recommendation may be given, and it is of great\r\nimportance,--that the troops be made to understand they must by no means\r\ndespair of finally defending a line which may be forced at one point;\r\nbecause, if a good reserve is at hand, it may take the offensive, attack\r\nthe assailant, and succeed in driving him out of the work he may have\r\nsupposed in his power.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUPS DE MAIN.\r\n\r\nThese are bold enterprises undertaken by a detachment of an army for the\r\ncapture of posts of different strength or importance.[30] They partake\r\nof the nature both of surprises and attacks by main force, for both\r\nthese methods may be employed in carrying an attempt of this sort to a\r\nsuccessful issue. Although _coups de main_ seem to be entirely tactical\r\noperations, their importance certainly depends on the relations of the\r\ncaptured posts to the strategic combinations in hand. It will become\r\nnecessary, therefore, to say a few words with reference to coups de main\r\nin Article XXXVI., when speaking of detachments. However tiresome these\r\nrepetitions may seem, I am obliged to state here the manner of executing\r\nsuch operations, as it is evidently a part of the subject of the attack\r\nof intrenchments.\r\n\r\nI do not pretend to say that the rules of tactics apply to these\r\noperations; for their name, _coups de main_, implies that ordinary rules\r\nare not applicable to them. I desire only to call attention to them, and\r\nrefer my readers to the different works, either historical or didactic,\r\nwhere they are mentioned.\r\n\r\nI have previously stated that important results may often follow from\r\nthese enterprises. The capture of Sizeboli in 1828, the unsuccessful\r\nattack of General Petrasch upon Kehl in 1796, the remarkable surprises\r\nof Cremona in 1702, of Gibraltar in 1704, and of Berg-op-zoom in 1814,\r\nas well as the escalades of Port Mahon and Badajos, give an idea of the\r\ndifferent kinds of _coup de main_. Some are effected by surprise, others\r\nby open force. Skill, stratagems, boldness, on the part of the\r\nassailant, and fear excited among the assailed, are some of the things\r\nwhich have an influence upon the successful issue of _coups de main_.\r\n\r\nAs war is now waged, the capture of a post, however strong, is no longer\r\nof the same importance as formerly unless it has a direct influence upon\r\nthe results of a great strategic operation.\r\n\r\nThe capture or destruction of a bridge defended by intrenchments, that\r\nof a large convoy, of a small fort closing important passes, like the\r\ntwo attacks which were made in 1799 upon the fort of Lucisteig in the\r\nGrisons; the capture of Leutasch and Scharnitz by Ney in 1805; finally,\r\nthe capture of a post not even fortified, but used as a great depot of\r\nprovisions and munitions much needed by the enemy;--such are the\r\nenterprises which will justify the risks to which a detachment engaging\r\nin them may be exposed.\r\n\r\nPosts have been captured by filling up the ditches sometimes with\r\nfascines, sometimes with bags of wool; and manure has been used for the\r\nsame purpose. Ladders are generally necessary, and should always be\r\nprepared. Hooks have been used in the hands and attached to the shoes of\r\nsoldiers, to help them in climbing rocky heights which commanded the\r\nintrenchment. An entrance was effected through the sewers at Cremona by\r\nPrince Eugene.\r\n\r\nIn reading such facts, we must draw from them not rules, but hints; for\r\nwhat has been done once may be done again.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: The number of defenders at Dresden the first day (August\r\n25) was twenty-four thousand, the next day, sixty-five thousand, and the\r\nthird day, more than one hundred thousand.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: The distinction between the importance and the strength of\r\na post must be observed; for it may be very strong and of very little\r\nimportance, and vice aversá.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nOF SEVERAL MIXED OPERATIONS, WHICH ARE IN CHARACTER PARTLY STRATEGICAL\r\nAND PARTLY TACTICAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXXVI.\r\n\r\nOf Diversions and Great Detachments.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe operations of the detachments an army may send out have so important\r\na bearing on the success of a campaign, that the duty of determining\r\ntheir strength and the proper occasions for them is one of the greatest\r\nand most delicate responsibilities imposed upon a commander. If nothing\r\nis more useful in war than a strong detachment opportunely sent out and\r\nhaving a good _ensemble_ of operations with the main body, it is equally\r\ncertain that no expedient is more dangerous when inconsiderately\r\nadopted. Frederick the Great regarded it as one of the essential\r\nqualities of a general to know how to make his adversary send out many\r\ndetachments, either with the view of destroying them in detail or of\r\nattacking the main body during their absence.\r\n\r\nThe division of armies into numerous detachments has sometimes been\r\ncarried to so great an extent, and with such poor results, that many\r\npersons now believe it better to have none of them. It is undoubtedly\r\nmuch safer and more agreeable for an army to be kept in a single mass;\r\nbut it is a thing at times impossible or incompatible with gaining a\r\ncomplete or even considerable success. The essential point in this\r\nmatter is to send out as few detachments as possible.\r\n\r\nThere are several kinds of detachments.\r\n\r\n     1. There are large corps dispatched to a distance from the zone of\r\n     operations of the main army, in order to make diversions of greater\r\n     or less importance.\r\n\r\n     2. There are large detachments made in the zone of operations to\r\n     cover important points of this zone, to carry on a siege, to guard\r\n     a secondary base, or to protect the line of operations if\r\n     threatened.\r\n\r\n     3. There are large detachments made upon the front of operations,\r\n     in face of the enemy, to act in concert with the main body in some\r\n     combined operation.\r\n\r\n     4. There are small detachments sent to a distance to try the effect\r\n     of surprise upon isolated points, whose capture may have an\r\n     important bearing upon the general operations of the campaign.\r\n\r\nI understand by diversions those secondary operations carried out at a\r\ndistance from the principal zone of operations, at the extremities of a\r\ntheater of war, upon the success of which it is sometimes foolishly\r\nsupposed the whole campaign depends. Such diversions are useful in but\r\ntwo cases, the first of which arises when the troops thus employed\r\ncannot conveniently act elsewhere on account of their distance from the\r\nreal theater of operations, and the second is that where such a\r\ndetachment would receive strong support from the population among which\r\nit was sent,--the latter case belonging rather to political than\r\nmilitary combinations. A few illustrative examples may not be out of\r\nplace here.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate results for the allied powers of the Anglo-Russian\r\nexpedition to Holland, and of that of the Archduke Charles toward the\r\nend of the last century, (which have been referred to in Article XIX.,)\r\nare well known.\r\n\r\nIn 1805, Napoleon was occupying Naples and Hanover. The allies intended\r\nan Anglo-Russian army to drive him out of Italy, while the combined\r\nforces of England, Russia, and Sweden should drive him from Hanover,\r\nnearly sixty thousand men being designed for these two widely-separated\r\npoints. But, while their troops were collecting at the two extremities\r\nof Europe, Napoleon ordered the evacuation of Naples and Hanover,\r\nSaint-Cyr hastened to effect a junction with Massena in the Frioul, and\r\nBernadotte, leaving Hanover, moved up to take part in the operations of\r\nUlm and Austerlitz. After these astonishing successes, Napoleon had no\r\ndifficulty in retaking Naples and Hanover. This is an example of the\r\nfailure of diversions. I will give an instance where such an operation\r\nwould have been proper.\r\n\r\nIn the civil wars of 1793, if the allies had sent twenty thousand men to\r\nLa Vendée, they would have accomplished much more than by increasing the\r\nnumbers of those who were fighting fruitlessly at Toulon, upon the\r\nRhine, and in Belgium. Here is a case where a diversion would have been\r\nnot only very useful, but decisive.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that, besides diversions to a distance and of\r\nsmall bodies, large corps are often detached in the zone of operations\r\nof the main army.\r\n\r\nIf the employment of these large corps thus detached for secondary\r\nobjects is more dangerous than the diversions above referred to, it is\r\nno less true that they are often highly proper and, it may be,\r\nindispensable.\r\n\r\nThese great detachments are chiefly of two kinds. The first are\r\npermanent corps which must be sometimes thrown out in a direction\r\nopposite to the main line of operations, and are to remain throughout a\r\ncampaign. The second are corps temporarily detached for the purpose of\r\nassisting in carrying out some special enterprise.\r\n\r\nAmong the first should be especially enumerated those fractions of an\r\narmy that are detached either to form the strategic reserve, of which\r\nmention has been made, or to cover lines of operation and retreat when\r\nthe configuration of the theater of the war exposes them to attack. For\r\nexample, a Russian army that wishes to cross the Balkan is obliged to\r\nleave a portion of its forces to observe Shumla, Routchouk, and the\r\nvalley of the Danube, whose direction is perpendicular to its line of\r\noperations. However successful it may be, a respectable force must\r\nalways be left toward Giurgevo or Krajova, and even on the right bank of\r\nthe river toward Routchouk.\r\n\r\nThis single example shows that it is sometimes necessary to have a\r\ndouble strategic front, and then the detachment of a considerable corps\r\nmust be made to offer front to a part of the enemy's army in rear of the\r\nmain army. Other localities and other circumstances might be mentioned\r\nwhere this measure would be equally essential to safety. One case is the\r\ndouble strategic front of the Tyrol and the Frioul for a French army\r\npassing the Adige. On whichever side it may wish to direct its main\r\ncolumn, a detachment must be left on the other front sufficiently strong\r\nto hold in check the enemy threatening to cut the line of\r\ncommunications. The third example is the frontier of Spain, which\r\nenables the Spaniards to establish a double front,--one covering the\r\nroad to Madrid, the other having Saragossa or Galicia as a base. To\r\nwhichever side the invading army turns, a detachment must be left on the\r\nother proportioned in magnitude to the enemy's force in that direction.\r\n\r\nAll that can be said on this point is that it is advantageous to enlarge\r\nas much as possible the field of operations of such detachments, and to\r\ngive them as much power of mobility as possible, in order to enable them\r\nby opportune movements to strike important blows. A most remarkable\r\nillustration of this truth was given by Napoleon in the campaign of\r\n1797. Obliged as he was to leave a corps of fifteen thousand men in the\r\nvalley of the Adige to observe the Tyrol while he was operating toward\r\nthe Noric Alps, he preferred to draw this corps to his aid, at the risk\r\nof losing temporarily his line of retreat, rather than leave the parts\r\nof his army disconnected and exposed to defeat in detail. Persuaded that\r\nhe could be victorious with his army united, he apprehended no\r\nparticular danger from the presence of a few hostile detachments upon\r\nhis communications.\r\n\r\nGreat movable and temporary detachments are made for the following\r\nreasons:--\r\n\r\n     1. To compel your enemy to retreat to cover his line of operations,\r\n     or else to cover your own.\r\n\r\n     2. To intercept a corps and prevent its junction with the main body\r\n     of the enemy, or to facilitate the approach of your own\r\n     reinforcements.\r\n\r\n     3. To observe and hold in position a large portion of the opposing\r\n     army, while a blow is struck at the remainder.\r\n\r\n     4. To carry off a considerable convoy of provisions or munitions,\r\n     on receiving which depended the continuance of a siege or the\r\n     success of any strategic enterprise, or to protect the march of a\r\n     convoy of your own.\r\n\r\n     5. To make a demonstration to draw the enemy in a direction where\r\n     you wish him to go, in order to facilitate the execution of an\r\n     enterprise in another direction.\r\n\r\n     6. To mask, or even to invest, one or more fortified places for a\r\n     certain time, with a view either to attack or to keep the garrison\r\n     shut up within the ramparts.\r\n\r\n     7. To take possession of an important point upon the communications\r\n     of an enemy already retreating.\r\n\r\nHowever great may be the temptation to undertake such operations as\r\nthose enumerated, it must be constantly borne in mind that they are\r\nalways secondary in importance, and that the essential thing is to be\r\nsuccessful at the decisive points. A multiplication of detachments must,\r\ntherefore, be avoided. Armies have been destroyed for no other reason\r\nthan that they were not kept together.\r\n\r\nWe will here refer to several of these enterprises, to show that their\r\nsuccess depends sometimes upon good fortune and sometimes upon the skill\r\nof their designer, and that they often fail from faulty execution.\r\n\r\nPeter the Great took the first step toward the destruction of Charles\r\nXII. by causing the seizure, by a strong detachment, of the famous\r\nconvoy Lowenhaupt was bringing up. Villars entirely defeated at Denain\r\nthe large detachment Prince Eugene sent out in 1709 under D'Albermale.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the great convoy Laudon took from Frederick during\r\nthe siege of Olmutz compelled the king to evacuate Moravia. The fate of\r\nthe two detachments of Fouquet at Landshut in 1760, and of Fink at Maxen\r\nin 1759, demonstrates how difficult it is at times to avoid making\r\ndetachments, and how dangerous they may be. To come nearer our own\r\ntimes, the disaster of Vandamme at Culm was a bloody lesson, teaching\r\nthat a corps must not be thrust forward too boldly: however, we must\r\nadmit that in this case the operation was well planned, and the fault\r\nwas not so much in sending out the detachment as in not supporting it\r\nproperly, as might easily have been done. That of Fink was destroyed at\r\nMaxen nearly on the same spot and for the same reason.\r\n\r\nDiversions or demonstrations in the zone of operations of the army are\r\ndecidedly advantageous when arranged for the purpose of engaging the\r\nenemy's attention in one direction, while the mass of the forces is\r\ncollected upon another point where the important blow is to be struck.\r\nIn such a case, care must be taken not only to avoid engaging the corps\r\nmaking the demonstration, but to recall it promptly toward the main\r\nbody. We will mention two examples as illustrations of these facts.\r\n\r\nIn 1800, Moreau, wishing to deceive Kray as to the true direction of his\r\nmarch, carried his left wing toward Rastadt from Kehl, whilst he was\r\nreally filing off his army toward Stockach; his left, having simply\r\nshown itself, returned toward the center by Fribourg in Brisgau.\r\n\r\nIn 1805, Napoleon, while master of Vienna, detached the corps of\r\nBernadotte to Iglau to overawe Bohemia and paralyze the Archduke\r\nFerdinand, who was assembling an army in that territory; in another\r\ndirection he sent Davoust to Presburg to show himself in Hungary; but he\r\nwithdrew them to Brunn, to take part in the event which was to decide\r\nthe issue of the campaign, and a great and decisive victory was the\r\nresult of his wise maneuvers. Operations of this kind, so far from being\r\nin opposition to the principles of the art of war, are necessary to\r\nfacilitate their application.\r\n\r\nIt readily appears from what goes before that precise rules cannot be\r\nlaid down for these operations, so varied in character, the success of\r\nwhich depends on so many minute details. Generals should run the risk of\r\nmaking detachments only after careful consideration and observation of\r\nall the surrounding circumstances. The only reasonable rules on the\r\nsubject are these: send out as few detachments as possible, and recall\r\nthorn immediately when their duty is performed. The inconveniences\r\nnecessarily attending them may be made as few as practicable, by giving\r\njudicious and carefully-prepared instructions to their commanders:\r\nherein lies the great talent of a good chief of staff.\r\n\r\nOne of the means of avoiding the disastrous results to which detachments\r\nsometimes lead is to neglect none of the precautions prescribed by\r\ntactics for increasing the strength of any force by posting it in good\r\npositions; but it is generally imprudent to engage in a serious conflict\r\nwith too large a body of troops. In such cases ease and rapidity of\r\nmotion will be most likely to insure safety. It seldom happens that it\r\nis right for a detachment to resolve to conquer or die in the position\r\nit has taken, whether voluntarily or by order.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that in all possible cases the rules of tactics and of\r\nfield-fortification must be applied by detachments as well as by the\r\narmy itself.\r\n\r\nSince we have included in the number of useful cases of detachments\r\nthose intended for _coups de main_, it is proper to mention a few\r\nexamples of this kind to enable the reader to judge for himself. We may\r\ncall to mind that one which was executed by the Russians toward the end\r\nof 1828 with the view of taking possession of Sizeboli in the Gulf of\r\nBourghas. The capture of this feebly-fortified gulf, which the Russians\r\nrapidly strengthened, procured for them in case of success an essential\r\n_point d'appui_ beyond the Balkan, where depots could be established in\r\nadvance for the army intending to cross those mountains: in case of\r\nfailure, no one was compromised,--not even the small corps which had\r\nbeen debarked, since it had a safe and certain retreat to the shipping.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, in the campaign of 1796, the _coup de main_ attempted by\r\nthe Austrians for the purpose of taking possession of Kehl and\r\ndestroying the bridge whilst Moreau was returning from Bavaria, would\r\nhave had very important consequences if it had not failed.\r\n\r\nIn attempts of this kind a little is risked to gain a great deal; and,\r\nas they can in no wise compromise the safety of the main army, they may\r\nbe freely recommended.\r\n\r\nSmall bodies of troops thrown forward into the zone of the enemy's\r\noperations belong to the class of detachments that are judicious. A few\r\nhundred horsemen thus risked will be no great loss if captured; and they\r\nmay be the means of causing the enemy great injury. The small\r\ndetachments sent out by the Russians in 1807, 1812, and 1813 were a\r\ngreat hinderance to Napoleon's operations, and several times caused his\r\nplans to fail by intercepting his couriers.\r\n\r\nFor such expeditions officers should be selected who are bold and full\r\nof stratagems. They ought to inflict upon the enemy all the injury they\r\ncan without compromising themselves. When an opportunity of striking a\r\ntelling blow presents itself, they should not think for a moment of any\r\ndangers or difficulties in their path. Generally, however, address and\r\npresence of mind, which will lead them to avoid useless danger, are\r\nqualities more necessary for a partisan than cool, calculating boldness.\r\nFor further information on this subject I refer my readers to Chapter\r\nXXXV. of the Treatise on Grand Operations, and to Article XLV. of this\r\nwork, on light cavalry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXXVII.\r\n\r\nPassage of Rivers and Other Streams.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe passage of a small stream, over which a bridge is already in place\r\nor might be easily constructed, presents none of the combinations\r\nbelonging to grand tactics or strategy; but the passage of a large\r\nriver, such as the Danube, the Rhine, the Po, the Elbe, the Oder, the\r\nVistula, the Inn, the Ticino, &c, is an operation worthy the closest\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nThe art of building military bridges is a special branch of military\r\nscience, which is committed to pontoniers or sappers. It is not from\r\nthis point of view that I propose to consider the passage of a stream,\r\nbut as the attack of a military position and as a maneuver.\r\n\r\nThe passage itself is a tactical operation; but the determination of the\r\npoint of passage may have an important connection with all the\r\noperations taking place within the entire theater of the war. The\r\npassage of the Rhine by General Moreau in 1800 is an excellent\r\nillustration of the truth of this remark. Napoleon, a more skillful\r\nstrategist than Moreau, desired him to cross at Schaffhausen in order to\r\ntake Kray's whole army in reverse, to reach Ulm before him, to cut him\r\noff from Austria and hurl him back upon the Main. Moreau, who had\r\nalready a bridge at Basel, preferred passing, with greater convenience\r\nto his army, in front of the enemy, to turning his extreme left. The\r\ntactical advantages seemed to his mind much more sure than the\r\nstrategical: he preferred the certainty of a partial success to the risk\r\nattending a victory which would have been a decisive one. In the same\r\ncampaign Napoleon's passage of the Po is another example of the high\r\nstrategic importance of the choice of the point of crossing. The army of\r\nthe reserve, after the engagement of the Chiusella, could either march\r\nby the left bank of the Po to Turin, or cross the river at Crescentino\r\nand march directly to Genoa. Napoleon preferred to cross the Ticino,\r\nenter Milan, effect a junction with Moncey who was approaching with\r\ntwenty thousand men by the Saint-Gothard pass, then to cross the Po at\r\nPiacenza, expecting to get before Mélas more certainly in that direction\r\nthan if he came down too soon upon his line of retreat. The passage of\r\nthe Danube at Donauwerth and Ingolstadt in 1805 was a very similar\r\noperation. The direction chosen for the passage was the prime cause of\r\nthe destruction of Mack's army.\r\n\r\nThe proper strategic point of passage is easily determined by\r\nrecollecting the principles laid down in Article XIX.; and it is here\r\nonly necessary to remind the reader that in crossing a river, as in\r\nevery other operation, there are permanent or geographical decisive\r\npoints, and others which are relative or eventual, depending on the\r\ndistribution of the hostile forces.\r\n\r\nIf the point selected combines strategic advantages with the tactical,\r\nno other point can be better; but if the locality presents obstacles\r\nexceedingly difficult to pass, another must be chosen, and in making the\r\nnew selection care should be taken to have the direction of the movement\r\nas nearly as possible coincident with the true strategic direction.\r\nIndependently of the general combinations, which exercise a great\r\ninfluence in fixing the point of passage, there is still another\r\nconsideration, connected with the locality itself. The best position is\r\nthat where the army after crossing can take its front of operations and\r\nline of battle perpendicular to the river, at least for the first\r\nmarches, without being forced to separate into several corps moving upon\r\ndifferent lines. This advantage will also save it the danger of fighting\r\na battle with a river in rear, as happened to Napoleon at Essling.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said with reference to the strategical considerations\r\ninfluencing the selection of the point of crossing a river. We will now\r\nproceed to speak of the passage itself. History is the best school in\r\nwhich to study the measures likely to insure the success of such\r\noperations. The ancients deemed the passage of the Granicus--which is a\r\nsmall stream--a wonderful exploit. So far as this point is concerned,\r\nthe people of modern days can cite much greater.\r\n\r\nThe passage of the Rhine at Tholhuys by Louis XIV. has been greatly\r\nlauded; and it was really remarkable. In our own time, General Dedon has\r\nmade famous the two passages of the Rhine at Kehl and of the Danube at\r\nHochstadt in 1800. His work is a model as far as concerns the details;\r\nand in these operations minute attention to details is every thing. More\r\nrecently, three other passages of the Danube, and the ever-famous\r\npassage of the Beresina, have exceeded every thing of the kind\r\npreviously seen. The two first were executed by Napoleon at Essling and\r\nat Wagram, in presence of an army of one hundred and twenty thousand men\r\nprovided with four hundred pieces of cannon, and at a point where the\r\nbed of the stream is broadest. General Pelet's interesting account of\r\nthem should be carefully read. The third was executed by the Russian\r\narmy at Satounovo in 1828, which, although not to be compared with the\r\ntwo just mentioned, was very remarkable on account of the great local\r\ndifficulties and the vigorous exertions made to surmount them. The\r\npassage of the Beresina was truly wonderful. My object not being to give\r\nhistorical details on this subject, I direct my readers to the special\r\nnarratives of these events. I will give several general rules to be\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n     1. It is essential to deceive the enemy as to the point of\r\n     passage, that he may not accumulate an opposing force there. In\r\n     addition to the strategic demonstrations, false attacks must be\r\n     made near the real one, to divide the attention and means of the\r\n     enemy. For this purpose half of the artillery should be employed to\r\n     make a great deal of noise at the points where the passage is not\r\n     to be made, whilst perfect silence should be preserved where the\r\n     real attempt is to be made.\r\n\r\n     2. The construction of the bridge should be covered as much as\r\n     possible by troops sent over in boats for the purpose of dislodging\r\n     the enemy who might interfere with the progress of the work; and\r\n     these troops should take possession at once of any villages, woods,\r\n     or other obstacles in the vicinity.\r\n\r\n     3. It is of importance also to arrange large batteries of heavy\r\n     caliber, not only to sweep the opposite bank, but to silence any\r\n     artillery the enemy might bring up to batter the bridge while\r\n     building. For this purpose it is convenient to have the bank from\r\n     which the passage is made somewhat higher than the other.\r\n\r\n     4. The proximity of a large island near the enemy's bank gives\r\n     great facilities for passing over troops in boats and for\r\n     constructing the bridge. In like manner, a smaller stream emptying\r\n     into the larger near the point of passage is a favorable place for\r\n     collecting and concealing boats and materials for the bridge.\r\n\r\n     5. It is well to choose a position where the river makes a\r\n     re-entering bend, as the batteries on the assailant's side can\r\n     cross their fire in front of the point where the troops are to land\r\n     from the boats and where the end of the bridge is to rest, thus\r\n     taking the enemy in front and flank when he attempts to oppose the\r\n     passage.\r\n\r\n     6. The locality selected should be near good roads on both banks,\r\n     that the army may have good communications to the front and rear on\r\n     both banks of the river. For this reason, those points where the\r\n     banks are high and steep should be usually avoided.\r\n\r\nThe rules for preventing a passage follow as a matter of course from\r\nthose for effecting it, as the duty of the defenders is to counteract\r\nthe efforts of the assailants. The important thing is to have the\r\ncourse of the river watched by bodies of light troops, without\r\nattempting to make a defense at every point. Concentrate rapidly at the\r\nthreatened point, in order to overwhelm the enemy while a part only of\r\nhis army shall have passed. Imitate the Duke of Vendôme at Cassano, and\r\nthe Archduke Charles at Essling in 1809,--the last example being\r\nparticularly worthy of praise, although the operation was not so\r\ndecidedly successful as might have been expected.\r\n\r\nIn Article XXI. attention was called to the influence that the passage\r\nof a river, in the opening of a campaign, may have in giving direction\r\nto the lines of operations. We will now see what connection it may have\r\nwith subsequent strategic movements.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest difficulties to be encountered after a passage is to\r\ncover the bridge against the enemy's efforts to destroy it, without\r\ninterfering too much with the free movement of the army. When the army\r\nis numerically very superior to the enemy, or when the river is passed\r\njust after a great victory gained, the difficulty mentioned is trifling;\r\nbut when the campaign is just opening, and the two opposing armies are\r\nabout equal, the case is very different.\r\n\r\nIf one hundred thousand Frenchmen pass the Rhine at Strasbourg or at\r\nManheim in presence of one hundred thousand Austrians, the first thing\r\nto be done will be to drive the enemy in three directions,--first,\r\nbefore them as far as the Black Forest, secondly, by the right in order\r\nto cover the bridges on the Upper Rhine, and thirdly, by the left to\r\ncover the bridges of Mayence and the Lower Rhine. This necessity is the\r\ncause of an unfortunate division of the forces; but, to make the\r\ninconveniences of this subdivision as few as possible, the idea must be\r\ninsisted on that it is by no means essential for the army to be\r\nseparated into three equal parts, nor need these detachments remain\r\nabsent longer than the few days required for taking possession of the\r\nnatural point of concentration of the enemy's forces.\r\n\r\nThe fact cannot be concealed, however, that the case supposed is one in\r\nwhich the general finds his position a most trying one; for if he\r\ndivides his army to protect his bridges he may be obliged to contend\r\nwith one of his subdivisions against the whole of the enemy's force, and\r\nhave it overwhelmed; and if he moves his army upon a single line, the\r\nenemy may divide his army and reassemble it at some unexpected point,\r\nthe bridges may be captured or destroyed, and the general may find\r\nhimself compromised before he has had time or opportunity to gain a\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nThe best course to be pursued is to place the bridges near a city which\r\nwill afford a strong defensive point for their protection, to infuse all\r\npossible vigor and activity into the first operations after the passage,\r\nto fall upon the subdivisions of the enemy's army in succession, and to\r\nbeat them in such a way that they will have no further desire of\r\ntouching the bridges. In some cases eccentric lines of operations may be\r\nused. If the enemy has divided his one hundred thousand men into several\r\ncorps, occupying posts of observation, a passage may be effected with\r\none hundred thousand men at a single point near the center of the line\r\nof posts, the isolated defensive corps at this position may be\r\noverwhelmed, and two masses of fifty thousand men each may then be\r\nformed, which, by taking diverging lines of operations, can certainly\r\ndrive off the successive portions of the opposing army, prevent them\r\nfrom reuniting, and remove them farther and farther from the bridges.\r\nBut if, on the contrary, the passage be effected at one extremity of the\r\nenemy's strategic front, by moving rapidly along this front the enemy\r\nmay be beaten throughout its whole extent,--in the same manner that\r\nFrederick tactically beat the Austrian line at Leuthen throughout its\r\nlength,--the bridges will be secure in rear of the army, and remain\r\nprotected during all the forward movements. It was in this manner that\r\nJourdan, having passed the Rhine at Dusseldorf in 1795, on the extreme\r\nright of the Austrians, could have advanced in perfect safety toward the\r\nMain. He was driven away because the French, having a double and\r\nexterior line of operations, left one hundred and twenty thousand men\r\ninactive between Mayence and Basel, while Clairfayt repulsed Jourdan\r\nupon the Lahn. But this cannot diminish the importance of the advantages\r\ngained by passing a river upon one extremity of the enemy's strategic\r\nfront. A commander-in-chief should either adopt this method, or that\r\npreviously explained, of a central mass at the moment of passage, and\r\nthe use of eccentric lines afterward, according to the circumstances of\r\nthe case, the situation of the frontiers and bases of operations, as\r\nwell as the positions of the enemy. The mention of these combinations,\r\nof which something has already been said in the article on lines of\r\noperations, does not appear out of place here, since their connection\r\nwith the location of bridges has been the chief point under discussion.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that, for cogent reasons, a double passage is\r\nattempted upon a single front of operations, as was the case with\r\nJourdan and Moreau in 1796. If the advantage is gained of having in case\r\nof need a double line of retreat, there is the inconvenience, in thus\r\noperating on the two extremities of the enemy's front, of forcing him,\r\nin a measure, to concentrate on his center, and he may be placed in a\r\ncondition to overwhelm separately the two armies which have crossed at\r\ndifferent points. Such an operation will always lead to disastrous\r\nresults when the opposing general has sufficient ability to know how to\r\ntake advantage of this violation of principles.\r\n\r\nIn such a case, the inconveniences of the double passage may be\r\ndiminished by passing over the mass of the forces at one of the points,\r\nwhich then becomes the decisive one, and by concentrating the two\r\nportions by interior lines as rapidly as possible, to prevent the enemy\r\nfrom destroying them separately. If Jourdan and Moreau had observed this\r\nrule, and made a junction of their forces in the direction of\r\nDonauwerth, instead of moving eccentrically, they would probably have\r\nachieved great successes in Bavaria, instead of being driven back upon\r\nthe Rhine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nRetreats and Pursuits.\r\n\r\n\r\nRetreats are certainly the most difficult operations in war. This remark\r\nis so true that the celebrated Prince de Ligne said, in his usual\r\npiquant style, that he could not conceive how an army ever succeeded in\r\nretreating. When we think of the physical and moral condition of an army\r\nin full retreat after a lost battle, of the difficulty of preserving\r\norder, and of the disasters to which disorder may lead, it is not hard\r\nto understand why the most experienced generals have hesitated to\r\nattempt such an operation.\r\n\r\nWhat method of retreat shall be recommended? Shall the fight be\r\ncontinued at all hazards until nightfall and the retreat executed under\r\ncover of the darkness? or is it better not to wait for this last chance,\r\nbut to abandon the field of battle while it can be done and a strong\r\nopposition still made to the pursuing army? Should a forced march be\r\nmade in the night, in order to get as much start of the enemy as\r\npossible? or is it better to halt after a half-march and make a show of\r\nfighting again? Each of these methods, although entirely proper in\r\ncertain cases, might in others prove ruinous to the whole army. If the\r\ntheory of war leaves any points unprovided for, that of retreats is\r\ncertainly one of them.\r\n\r\nIf you determine to fight vigorously until night, you may expose\r\nyourself to a complete defeat before that time arrives; and if a forced\r\nretreat must begin when the shades of night are shrouding every thing in\r\ndarkness and obscurity, how can you prevent the disintegration of your\r\narmy, which does not know what to do, and cannot see to do any thing\r\nproperly? If, on the other hand, the field of battle is abandoned in\r\nbroad daylight and before all possible efforts have been made to hold\r\nit, you may give up the contest at the very moment when the enemy is\r\nabout to do the same thing; and this fact coming to the knowledge of the\r\ntroops, you may lose their confidence,--as they are always inclined to\r\nblame a prudent general who retreats before the necessity for so doing\r\nmay be evident to themselves. Moreover, who can say that a retreat\r\ncommenced in the daylight in presence of an enterprising enemy may not\r\nbecome a rout?\r\n\r\nWhen the retreat is actually begun, it is no less difficult to decide\r\nwhether a forced march shall be made to get as much the start of the\r\nenemy as possible,--since this hurried movement might sometimes cause\r\nthe destruction of the army, and might, in other circumstances, be its\r\nsalvation. All that can be positively asserted on this subject is that,\r\nin general, with an army of considerable magnitude, it is best to\r\nretreat slowly, by short marches, with a well-arranged rear-guard of\r\nsufficient strength to hold the heads of the enemy's columns in check\r\nfor several hours.\r\n\r\nRetreats are of different kinds, depending upon the cause from which\r\nthey result. A general may retire of his own accord before fighting, in\r\norder to draw his adversary to a position which he prefers to his\r\npresent one. This is rather a prudent maneuver than a retreat. It was\r\nthus that Napoleon retired in 1805 from Wischau toward Brunn to draw the\r\nallies to a point which suited him as a battle-field. It was thus that\r\nWellington retired from Quatre-Bras to Waterloo. This is what I proposed\r\nto do before the attack at Dresden, when the arrival of Napoleon was\r\nknown. I represented the necessity of moving toward Dippoldiswalde to\r\nchoose a favorable battle-field. It was supposed to be a retreat that I\r\nwas proposing; and a mistaken idea of honor prevented a retrograde\r\nmovement without fighting, which would have been the means of avoiding\r\nthe catastrophe of the next day, (August 26, 1813.)\r\n\r\nA general may retire in order to hasten to the defense of a point\r\nthreatened by the enemy, either upon the flanks or upon the line of\r\nretreat. When an army is marching at a distance from its depots, in an\r\nexhausted country, it may be obliged to retire in order to get nearer\r\nits supplies. Finally, an army retires involuntarily after a lost\r\nbattle, or after an unsuccessful enterprise.\r\n\r\nThese are not the only causes having an influence in retreats. Their\r\ncharacter will vary with that of the country, with the distances to be\r\npassed over and the obstacles to be surmounted. They are specially\r\ndangerous in an enemy's country; and when the points at which the\r\nretreats begin are distant from the friendly country and the base of\r\noperations, they become painful and difficult.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the famous retreat of the Ten Thousand, so justly\r\ncelebrated, until the terrible catastrophe which befell the French army\r\nin 1812, history does not make mention of many remarkable retreats. That\r\nof Antony, driven out of Media, was more painful than glorious. That of\r\nthe Emperor Julian, harassed by the same Parthians, was a disaster. In\r\nmore recent days, the retreat of Charles VIII. to Naples, when he passed\r\nby a corps of the Italian army at Fornovo, was an admirable one. The\r\nretreat of M. de Bellisle from Prague does not deserve the praises it\r\nhas received. Those executed by the King of Prussia after raising the\r\nsiege of Olmutz and after the surprise at Hochkirch were very well\r\narranged; but they were for short distances. That of Moreau in 1796,\r\nwhich was magnified in importance by party spirit, was creditable, but\r\nnot at all extraordinary. The retreat of Lecourbe from Engadin to\r\nAltorf, and that of Macdonald by Pontremoli after the defeat of the\r\nTrebbia, as also that of Suwaroff from the Muttenthal to Chur, were\r\nglorious feats of arms, but partial in character and of short duration.\r\nThe retreat of the Russian army from the Niemen to Moscow--a space of\r\ntwo hundred and forty leagues,--in presence of such an enemy as Napoleon\r\nand such cavalry as the active and daring Murat commanded, was certainly\r\nadmirable. It was undoubtedly attended by many favorable circumstances,\r\nbut was highly deserving of praise, not only for the talent displayed by\r\nthe generals who directed its first stages, but also for the admirable\r\nfortitude and soldierly bearing of the troops who performed it. Although\r\nthe retreat from Moscow was a bloody catastrophe for Napoleon, it was\r\nalso glorious for him and the troops who were at Krasnoi and the\r\nBeresina,--because the skeleton of the army was saved, when not a single\r\nman should have returned. In this ever-memorable event both parties\r\ncovered themselves with glory.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of the distances and the nature of the country to be\r\ntraversed, the resources it offers, the obstacles to be encountered, the\r\nattacks to be apprehended, either in rear or in flank, superiority or\r\ninferiority in cavalry, the spirit of the troops, are circumstances\r\nwhich have a great effect in deciding the fate of retreats, leaving out\r\nof consideration the skillful arrangements which the generals may make\r\nfor their execution.\r\n\r\nA general falling back toward his native land along his line of\r\nmagazines and supplies may keep his troops together and in good order,\r\nand may effect a retreat with more safety than one compelled to subsist\r\nhis army in cantonments, finding it necessary to occupy an extended\r\nposition. It would be absurd to pretend that a French army retiring from\r\nMoscow to the Niemen without supplies of provisions, in want of cavalry\r\nand draft horses, could effect the movement in the same good order and\r\nwith the same steadiness as a Russian army, well provided with every\r\nthing necessary, marching in its own country, and covered by an immense\r\nnumber of light cavalry.\r\n\r\nThere are five methods of arranging a retreat:--\r\n\r\n     The first is to march in a single mass and upon one road.\r\n\r\n     The second consists in dividing the army into two or three corps,\r\n     marching at the distance of a day's march from each other, in order\r\n     to avoid confusion, especially in the _matériel_.\r\n\r\n     The third consists in marching upon a single front by several roads\r\n     nearly parallel and having a common point of arrival.\r\n\r\n     The fourth consists in moving by constantly converging roads.\r\n\r\n     The fifth, on the contrary, consists in moving along diverging\r\n     roads.\r\n\r\nI have nothing to say as to the formation of rear-guards; but it is\r\ntaken for granted that a good one should always be prepared and well\r\nsustained by a portion of the cavalry reserves. This arrangement is\r\ncommon to all kinds of retreats, but has nothing to do with the\r\nstrategic relations of these operations.\r\n\r\nAn army falling back in good order, with the intention of fighting as\r\nsoon as it shall have received expected reinforcements or as soon as it\r\nshall have reached a certain strategic position, should prefer the first\r\nmethod, as this particularly insures the compactness of the army and\r\nenables it to be in readiness for battle almost at any moment, since it\r\nis simply necessary to halt the heads of columns and form the remainder\r\nof the troops under their protection as they successively arrive. An\r\narmy employing this method must not, however, confine itself to the\r\nsingle main road, if there are side-roads sufficiently near to be\r\noccupied which may render its movements more rapid and secure.\r\n\r\nWhen Napoleon retired from Smolensk, he used the second method, having\r\nthe portions of his army separated by an entire march. He made therein a\r\ngreat mistake, because the enemy was not following upon his rear, but\r\nmoving along a lateral road which brought him in a nearly perpendicular\r\ndirection into the midst of the separated French corps. The three fatal\r\ndays of Krasnoi were the result. The employment of this method being\r\nchiefly to avoid incumbering the road, the interval between the\r\ndeparture of the several corps is sufficiently great when the artillery\r\nmay readily file off. Instead of separating the corps by a whole march,\r\nthe army would be better divided into two masses and a rear-guard, a\r\nhalf-march from each other. These masses, moving off in succession with\r\nan interval of two hours between the departure of their several\r\narmy-corps, may file off without incumbering the road, at least in\r\nordinary countries. In crossing the Saint-Bernard or the Balkan, other\r\ncalculations would doubtless be necessary.\r\n\r\nI apply this idea to an army of one hundred and twenty thousand or one\r\nhundred and fifty thousand men, having a rear-guard of twenty thousand\r\nor twenty-five thousand men distant about a half-march in rear. The army\r\nmay be divided into two masses of about sixty thousand men each,\r\nencamped at a distance of three or four leagues from each other. Each of\r\nthese masses will be subdivided into two or three corps, which may\r\neither move successively along the road or form in two lines across the\r\nroad. In either case, if one corps of thirty thousand men moves at five\r\nA.M. and the other at seven, there will be no danger of interference\r\nwith each other, unless something unusual should happen; for the second\r\nmass being at the same hours of the day about four leagues behind the\r\nfirst, they can never be occupying the same part of the road at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWhen there are practicable roads in the neighborhood, suitable at least\r\nfor infantry and cavalry, the intervals may be diminished. It is\r\nscarcely necessary to add that such an order of march can only be used\r\nwhen provisions are plentiful; and the third method is usually the best,\r\nbecause the army is then marching in battle-order. In long days and in\r\nhot countries the best times for marching are the night and the early\r\npart of the day. It is one of the most difficult problems of logistics\r\nto make suitable arrangements of hours of departures and halts for\r\narmies; and this is particularly the case in retreats.\r\n\r\nMany generals neglect to arrange the manner and times of halts, and\r\ngreat disorder on the march is the consequence, as each brigade or\r\ndivision takes the responsibility of halting whenever the soldiers are a\r\nlittle tired and find it agreeable to bivouac. The larger the army and\r\nthe more compactly it marches, the more important does it become to\r\narrange well the hours of departures and halts, especially if the army\r\nis to move at night. An ill-timed halt of part of a column may cause as\r\nmuch mischief as a rout.\r\n\r\nIf the rear-guard is closely pressed, the army should halt in order to\r\nrelieve it by a fresh corps taken from the second mass, which will halt\r\nwith this object in view. The enemy seeing eighty thousand men in\r\nbattle-order will think it necessary to halt and collect his columns;\r\nand then the retreat should recommence at nightfall, to regain the space\r\nwhich has been lost.\r\n\r\nThe third method, of retreating along several parallel roads, is\r\nexcellent when the roads are sufficiently near each other. But, if they\r\nare quite distant, one wing separated from the center and from the other\r\nwing may be compromised if the enemy attacks it in force and compels it\r\nto stand on the defensive. The Prussian army moving from Magdeburg\r\ntoward the Oder, in 1806, gives an example of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe fourth method, which consists in following concentric roads, is\r\nundoubtedly the best if the troops are distant from each other when the\r\nretreat is ordered. Nothing can be better, in such a case, than to unite\r\nthe forces; and the concentric retreat is the only method of effecting\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nThe fifth method indicated is nothing else than the famous system of\r\neccentric lines, which I have attributed to Bulow, and have opposed so\r\nwarmly in the earlier editions of my works, because I thought I could\r\nnot be mistaken either as to the sense of his remarks on the subject or\r\nas to the object of his system. I gathered from his definition that he\r\nrecommended to a retreating army, moving from any given position, to\r\nseparate into parts and pursue diverging roads, with the double object\r\nof withdrawing more readily from the enemy in pursuit and of arresting\r\nhis march by threatening his flanks and his line of communications. I\r\nfound great fault with the system, for the simple reason that a beaten\r\narmy is already weak enough, without absurdly still further dividing its\r\nforces and strength in presence of a victorious enemy.\r\n\r\nBulow has found defenders who declare that I mistake his meaning, and\r\nthat by the term _eccentric retreat_ he did not understand a retreat\r\nmade on several diverging roads, but one which, instead of being\r\ndirected toward the center of the base of operations or the center of\r\nthe country, should be eccentric to that focus of operations, and along\r\nthe line of the frontier of the country.\r\n\r\nI may possibly have taken an incorrect impression from his language, and\r\nin this case my criticism falls to the ground; for I have strongly\r\nrecommended that kind of a retreat to which I have given the name of the\r\nparallel retreat. It is my opinion that an army, leaving the line which\r\nleads from the frontiers to the center of the state, with a view of\r\nmoving to the right or the left, may very well pursue a course nearly\r\nparallel to the line of the frontiers, or to its front of operations and\r\nits base. It seems to me more rational to give the name of parallel\r\nretreat to such a movement as that described, designating as eccentric\r\nretreat that where diverging roads are followed, all leading from the\r\nstrategic front.\r\n\r\nHowever this dispute about words may result, the sole cause of which was\r\nthe obscurity of Bulow's text, I find fault only with those retreats\r\nmade along several diverging roads, under pretense of covering a greater\r\nextent of frontier and of threatening the enemy on both flanks.\r\n\r\nBy using these high-sounding words _flanks_, an air of importance may be\r\ngiven to systems entirely at variance with the principles of the art. An\r\narmy in retreat is always in a bad state, either physically or morally;\r\nbecause a retreat can only be the result of reverses or of numerical\r\ninferiority. Shall such an army be still more weakened by dividing it? I\r\nfind no fault with retreats executed in several columns, to increase the\r\nease of moving, when these columns can support each other; but I am\r\nspeaking of those made along diverging lines of operations. Suppose an\r\narmy of forty thousand men retreating before another of sixty thousand.\r\nIf the first forms four isolated divisions of about ten thousand men,\r\nthe enemy may maneuver with two masses of thirty thousand men each. Can\r\nhe not turn his adversary, surround, disperse, and ruin in succession\r\nall his divisions? How can they escape such a fate? _By concentration_.\r\nThis being in direct opposition to a divergent system, the latter falls\r\nof itself.\r\n\r\nI invoke to my support the great lessons of experience. When the leading\r\ndivisions of the army of Italy were repulsed by Wurmser, Bonaparte\r\ncollected them all together at Roverbella; and, although he had only\r\nforty thousand men, he fought and beat sixty thousand, because he had\r\nonly to contend against isolated columns. If he had made a divergent\r\nretreat, what would have become of his army and his victories? Wurmser,\r\nafter his first check, made an eccentric retreat, directing his two\r\nwings toward the extremities of the line of defense. What was the\r\nresult? His right, although supported by the mountains of the Tyrol, was\r\nbeaten at Trent. Bonaparte then fell upon the rear of his left, and\r\ndestroyed that at Bassano and Mantua.\r\n\r\nWhen the Archduke Charles gave way before the first efforts of the\r\nFrench armies in 1796, would he have saved Germany by an eccentric\r\nmovement? Was not the salvation of Germany due to his concentric\r\nretreat? At last Moreau, who had moved with a very extended line of\r\nisolated divisions, perceived that this was an excellent system for his\r\nown destruction, if he stood his ground and fought or adopted the\r\nalternative of retreating. He concentrated his scattered troops, and all\r\nthe efforts of the enemy were fruitless in presence of a mass which it\r\nwas necessary to watch throughout the whole length of a line of two\r\nhundred miles. Such examples must put an end to further discussion.[31]\r\n\r\nThere are two cases in which divergent retreats are admissible, and then\r\nonly as a last resource. First, when an army has experienced a great\r\ndefeat in its own country, and the scattered fragments seek protection\r\nwithin the walls of fortified places. Secondly, in a war where the\r\nsympathies of the whole population are enlisted, each fraction of the\r\narmy thus divided may serve as a nucleus of assembly in each province;\r\nbut in a purely methodical war, with regular armies, carried on\r\naccording to the principles of the art, divergent retreats are simply\r\nabsurd.\r\n\r\nThere is still another strategical consideration as to the direction of\r\na retreat,--to decide when it should be made perpendicularly to the\r\nfrontier and toward the interior of the country, or when it should be\r\nparallel to the frontier. For example, when Marshal Soult gave up the\r\nline of the Pyrenees in 1814, he had to choose one of two directions for\r\nhis retreat,--either by way of Bordeaux toward the interior of France,\r\nor by way of Toulouse parallel to the frontier formed by the Pyrenees.\r\nIn the same way, when Frederick retired from Moravia, he marched toward\r\nBohemia instead of returning to Silesia.\r\n\r\nThese parallel retreats are often to be preferred, for the reason that\r\nthey divert the enemy from a march upon the capital of the state and the\r\ncenter of its power. The propriety of giving such a direction to a\r\nretreat must be determined by the configuration of the frontiers, the\r\npositions of the fortresses, the greater or less space the army may\r\nhave for its marches, and the facilities for recovering its direct\r\ncommunications with the central portions of the state.\r\n\r\nSpain is admirably suited to the use of this system. If a French army\r\npenetrates by way of Bayonne, the Spaniards may base themselves upon\r\nPampeluna and Saragossa, or upon Leon and the Asturias; and in either\r\ncase the French cannot move directly to Madrid, because their line of\r\noperations would be at the mercy of their adversary.\r\n\r\nThe frontier of the Turkish empire on the Danube presents the same\r\nadvantages, if the Turks knew how to profit by them.\r\n\r\nIn France also the parallel retreat may be used, especially when the\r\nnation itself is not divided into two political parties each of which is\r\nstriving for the possession of the capital. If the hostile army\r\npenetrates through the Alps, the French can act on the Rhone and the\r\nSaône, passing around the frontier as far as the Moselle on one side, or\r\nas far as Provence on the other. If the enemy enters the country by way\r\nof Strasbourg, Mayence, or Valenciennes, the same thing can be done. The\r\noccupation of Paris by the enemy would be impossible, or at least very\r\nhazardous, so long as a French army remained in good condition and based\r\nupon its circle of fortified towns. The same is the case for all\r\ncountries having double fronts of operations.[32]\r\n\r\nAustria is perhaps not so fortunately situated, on account of the\r\ndirections of the Rhetian and Tyrolean Alps and of the river Danube.\r\nLloyd, however, considers Bohemia and the Tyrol as two bastions\r\nconnected by the strong curtain of the river Inn, and regards this\r\nfrontier as exceedingly well suited for parallel movements. This\r\nassertion was not well sustained by the events of the campaigns of 1800,\r\n1805, and 1809; but, as the parallel method has not yet had a fair trial\r\non that ground, the question is still an open one.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the propriety of applying the parallel method\r\ndepends mainly upon the existing and the antecedent circumstances of\r\neach case. If a French army should approach from the Rhine by way of\r\nBavaria, and should find allies in force upon the Lech and the Iser, it\r\nwould be a very delicate operation to throw the whole Austrian army into\r\nthe Tyrol and into Bohemia, with the expectation of arresting in this\r\nway the forward movement to Vienna. If half the Austrian army is left\r\nupon the Inn to cover the approaches to the capital, an unfortunate\r\ndivision of force is the consequence; and if it is decided to throw the\r\nwhole army into the Tyrol, leaving the way to Vienna open, there would\r\nbe great danger incurred if the enemy is at all enterprising. In Italy,\r\nbeyond the Mincio, the parallel method would be of difficult application\r\non the side of the Tyrol, as well as in Bohemia against an enemy\r\napproaching from Saxony, for the reason that the theater of operations\r\nwould be too contracted.\r\n\r\nIn Prussia the parallel retreat may be used with great advantage against\r\nan army debouching from Bohemia upon the Elbe or the Oder, whilst its\r\nemployment would be impossible against a French army moving from the\r\nRhine, or a Russian army from the Vistula, unless Prussia and Austria\r\nwere allies. This is a result of the geographical configuration of the\r\ncountry, which allows and even favors lateral movements: in the\r\ndirection of its greatest dimension, (from Memel to Mayence;) but such a\r\nmovement would be disastrous if made from Dresden to Stettin.\r\n\r\nWhen an army retreats, whatever may be the motive of the operation, a\r\npursuit always follows.\r\n\r\nA retreat, even when executed in the most skillful manner and by an army\r\nin good condition, always gives an advantage to the pursuing army; and\r\nthis is particularly the case after a defeat and when the source of\r\nsupplies and reinforcements is at a great distance; for a retreat then\r\nbecomes more difficult than any other operation in war, and its\r\ndifficulties increase in proportion to the skill exhibited by the enemy\r\nin conducting the pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe boldness and activity of the pursuit will depend, of course, upon\r\nthe character of the commanders and upon the _physique_ and _morale_ of\r\nthe two armies. It is difficult to prescribe fixed rules for all cases\r\nof pursuits, but the following points must be recollected:--\r\n\r\n     1. It is generally better to direct the pursuit upon the flank of\r\n     the retreating columns, especially when it is made in one's own\r\n     country and where no danger is incurred in moving perpendicularly\r\n     or diagonally upon the enemy's line of operations. Care must,\r\n     however, be taken not to make too large a circuit; for there might\r\n     then be danger of losing the retreating enemy entirely.\r\n\r\n     2. A pursuit should generally be as boldly and actively executed as\r\n     possible, especially when it is subsequent to a battle gained;\r\n     because the demoralized army may be wholly dispersed if vigorously\r\n     followed up.\r\n\r\n     3. There are very few cases where it is wise to make a bridge of\r\n     gold for the enemy, no matter what the old Roman proverb may say;\r\n     for it can scarcely ever be desirable to pay an enemy to leave a\r\n     country, unless in the case when an unexpected success shall have\r\n     been gained over him by an army much inferior to his in numbers.\r\n\r\nNothing further of importance can be added to what has been said on the\r\nsubject of retreats, as far as they are connected with grand\r\ncombinations of strategy. We may profitably indicate several tactical\r\nmeasures which may render them more easy of execution.\r\n\r\nOne of the surest means of making a retreat successfully is to\r\nfamiliarize the officers and soldiers with the idea that an enemy may be\r\nresisted quite as well when coming on the rear as on the front, and that\r\nthe preservation of order is the only means of saving a body of troops\r\nharassed by the enemy during a retrograde movement. Rigid discipline is\r\nat all times the best preservative of good order, but it is of special\r\nimportance during a retreat. To enforce discipline, subsistence must be\r\nfurnished, that the troops may not be obliged to straggle off for the\r\npurpose of getting supplies by marauding.\r\n\r\nIt is a good plan to give the command of the rear-guard to an officer\r\nof great coolness, and to attach to it staff officers who may, in\r\nadvance of its movements, examine and select points suitable for\r\noccupation to hold the enemy temporarily in check. Cavalry can rally so\r\nrapidly on the main body that it is evidently desirable to have\r\nconsiderable bodies of such troops, as they greatly facilitate the\r\nexecution of a slow and methodical retreat, and furnish the means of\r\nthoroughly examining the road itself and the neighborhood, so as to\r\nprevent an unexpected onset of the enemy upon the flanks of the\r\nretreating columns.\r\n\r\nIt is generally sufficient if the rear-guard keep the enemy at the\r\ndistance of half a day's march from the main body. The rear-guard would\r\nrun great risk of being itself cut off, if farther distant. When,\r\nhowever, there are defiles in its rear which are held by friends, it may\r\nincrease the sphere of its operations and remain a full day's march to\r\nthe rear; for a defile, when held, facilitates a retreat in the same\r\ndegree that it renders it more difficult if in the power of the enemy.\r\nIf the army is very numerous and the rear-guard proportionally large, it\r\nmay remain a day's march in rear. This will depend, however, upon its\r\nstrength, the nature of the country, and the character and strength of\r\nthe pursuing force. If the enemy presses up closely, it is of importance\r\nnot to permit him to do so with impunity, especially if the retreat is\r\nmade in good order. In such a case it is a good plan to halt from time\r\nto time and fall unexpectedly upon the enemy's advanced guard, as the\r\nArchduke Charles did in 1796 at Neresheim, Moreau at Biberach, and\r\nKleber at Ukerath. Such a maneuver almost always succeeds, on account of\r\nthe surprise occasioned by an unexpected offensive return upon a body of\r\ntroops which is thinking of little else than collecting trophies and\r\nspoils.\r\n\r\nPassages of rivers in retreat are also operations by no means devoid of\r\ninterest. If the stream is narrow and there are permanent bridges over\r\nit, the operation is nothing more than the passage of a defile; but when\r\nthe river is wide and is to be crossed upon a temporary military bridge,\r\nit is a maneuver of extreme delicacy. Among the precautions to be\r\ntaken, a very important one is to get the parks well advanced, so that\r\nthey may be out of the way of the army; for this purpose it is well for\r\nthe army to halt a half-day's march from the river. The rear-guard\r\nshould also keep at more than the usual distance from the main body,--as\r\nfar, in fact, as the locality and the respective forces opposed will\r\npermit. The army may thus file across the bridge without being too much\r\nhurried. The march of the rear-guard should be so arranged that it shall\r\nhave reached a position in front of the bridge just as the last of the\r\nmain body has passed. This will be a suitable moment for relieving the\r\nrear-guard by fresh troops strongly posted. The rear-guard will pass\r\nthrough the intervals of the fresh troops in position and will cross the\r\nriver; the enemy, coming up and finding fresh troops drawn up to give\r\nhim battle, will make no attempt to press them too closely. The new\r\nrear-guard will hold its position until night, and will then cross the\r\nriver, breaking the bridges after it.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, understood that as fast as the troops pass they form\r\non the opposite bank and plant batteries, so as to protect the corps\r\nleft to hold the enemy in check.\r\n\r\nThe dangers of such a passage in retreat, and the nature of the\r\nprecautions which facilitate it, indicate that measures should always be\r\ntaken to throw up intrenchments at the point where the bridge is to be\r\nconstructed and the passage made. Where time is not allowed for the\r\nconstruction of a regular _tête de pont_, a few well-armed redoubts will\r\nbe found of great value in covering the retreat of the last troops.\r\n\r\nIf the passage of a large river is so difficult when the enemy is only\r\npressing on the rear of the column, it is far more so when the army is\r\nthreatened both in front and rear and the river is guarded by the enemy\r\nin force.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated passage of the Beresina by the French is one of the most\r\nremarkable examples of such an operation. Never was an army in a more\r\ndesperate condition, and never was one extricated more gloriously and\r\nskillfully. Pressed by famine, benumbed with cold, distant twelve\r\nhundred miles from its base of operations, assailed by the enemy in\r\nfront and in rear, having a river with marshy banks in front, surrounded\r\nby vast forests, how could it hope to escape? It paid dearly for the\r\nhonor it gained. The mistake of Admiral Tschitchagoff doubtless helped\r\nits escape; but the army performed heroic deeds, for which due praise\r\nshould be given. We do not know whether to admire most the plan of\r\noperations which brought up the Russian armies from the extremities of\r\nMoldavia, from Moscow, and from Polotzk to the Beresina as to a\r\nrendezvous arranged in peace,--a plan which came near effecting the\r\ncapture of their formidable adversary,--or the wonderful firmness of the\r\nlion thus pursued, who succeeded in opening a way through his enemies.\r\n\r\nThe only rules to be laid down are, not to permit your army to be\r\nclosely pressed upon, to deceive the enemy as to the point of passage,\r\nand to fall headlong upon the corps which bars the way before the one\r\nwhich is following the rear of your column can come up. Never place\r\nyourself in a position to be exposed to such danger; for escape in such\r\na case is rare.\r\n\r\nIf a retreating army should strive to protect its bridges either by\r\nregular _têtes de font_, or at least by lines of redoubts to cover the\r\nrear-guard, it is natural, also, that the enemy pursuing should use\r\nevery effort to destroy the bridges. When the retreat is made down the\r\nbank of a river, wooden houses may be thrown into the stream, also\r\nfire-ships and mills,--a means the Austrians used in 1796 against\r\nJourdan's army, near Neuwied on the Rhine, where they nearly compromised\r\nthe army of the Sambre and the Meuse. The Archduke Charles did the same\r\nthing at Essling in 1809. He broke the bridge over the Danube, and\r\nbrought Napoleon to the brink of ruin.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to secure a bridge against attacks of this character\r\nunless there is time for placing a stockade above it. Boats may be\r\nanchored, provided with ropes and grappling-hooks to catch floating\r\nbodies and with means for extinguishing fire-boats.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Ten years after this first refutation of Bulow's idea, the\r\nconcentric retreat of Barclay and Bagration saved the Russian army.\r\nAlthough it did not prevent Napoleon's first success, it was, in the\r\nend, the cause of his ruin.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: In all these calculations I suppose the contending forces\r\nnearly equal. If the invading army is twice as strong as the defensive,\r\nit may be divided into two equal parts, one of which may move directly\r\nupon the capital, while the other may follow the army retiring along the\r\nfrontier. If the armies are equal, this is impossible.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XXXIX.\r\n\r\nOf Cantonments, either when on the March, or when established in Winter\r\nQuarters.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo much has been written on this point, and its connection with my\r\nsubject is so indirect, that I shall treat it very briefly.\r\n\r\nTo maintain an army in cantonments, in a war actively carried on, is\r\ngenerally difficult, however connected the arrangement may be, and there\r\nis almost always some point exposed to the enemy's attacks. A country\r\nwhere large towns abound, as Lombardy, Saxony, the Netherlands, Swabia,\r\nor old Prussia, presents more facilities for the establishment of\r\nquarters than one where towns are few; for in the former case the troops\r\nhave not only convenient supplies of food, but shelters which permit the\r\ndivisions of the army to be kept closely together. In Poland, Russia,\r\nportions of Austria and France, in Spain and in Southern Italy, it is\r\nmore difficult to put an army into winter quarters.\r\n\r\nFormerly, it was usual for each party to go into winter quarters at the\r\nend of October, and all the fighting after that time was of a partisan\r\ncharacter and carried on by the advanced troops forming the outposts.\r\n\r\nThe surprise of the Austrian winter quarters in Upper Alsace in 1674, by\r\nTurenne, is a good example, from which may be learned the best method of\r\nconducting such an enterprise, and the precautions to be taken on the\r\nother side to prevent its success.\r\n\r\nThe best rules to be laid down on this subject seem to me to be the\r\nfollowing. Establish the cantonments very compactly and connectedly and\r\noccupying a space as broad as long, in order to avoid having a too\r\nextended line of troops, which is always easily broken through and\r\ncannot be concentrated in time; cover them by a river, or by an outer\r\nline of troops in huts and with their position strengthened by\r\nfield-works; fix upon points of assembly which may be reached by all the\r\ntroops before the enemy can penetrate so far; keep all the avenues by\r\nwhich an enemy may approach constantly patrolled by bodies of cavalry;\r\nfinally, establish signals to give warning if an attack is made at any\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1807, Napoleon established his army in cantonments\r\nbehind the Passarge in face of the enemy, the advanced guard alone being\r\nhutted near the cities of Gutstadt, Osterode, &c. The army numbered more\r\nthan one hundred and twenty thousand men, and much skill was requisite\r\nin feeding it and keeping it otherwise comfortable in this position\r\nuntil June. The country was of a favorable character; but this cannot be\r\nexpected to be the case everywhere.\r\n\r\nAn army of one hundred thousand men may find it not very difficult to\r\nhave a compact and well-connected system of winter quarters in countries\r\nwhere large towns are numerous. The difficulty increases with the size\r\nof the army. It must be observed, however, that if the extent of country\r\noccupied increases in proportion to the numbers in the army, the means\r\nof opposing an irruption of the enemy increase in the same proportion.\r\nThe important point is to be able to assemble fifty thousand or sixty\r\nthousand men in twenty-four hours. With such an army in hand, and with\r\nthe certainty of having it rapidly increased, the enemy may be held in\r\ncheck, no matter how strong he may be, until the whole army is\r\nassembled.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, however, that there will always be a risk in going\r\ninto winter quarters if the enemy keeps his army in a body and seems\r\ninclined to make offensive movements; and the conclusion to be drawn\r\nfrom this fact is, that the only method of giving secure repose to an\r\narmy in winter or in the midst of a campaign is to establish it in\r\nquarters protected by a river, or to arrange an armistice.\r\n\r\nIn the strategic positions taken up by an army in the course of a\r\ncampaign, whether marching, or acting as an army of observation, or\r\nwaiting for a favorable opportunity of taking the offensive, it will\r\nprobably occupy quite compact cantonments. The selection of such\r\npositions requires great experience upon the part of a general, in order\r\nthat he may form correct conclusions as to what he may expect the enemy\r\nto do. An army should occupy space enough to enable it to subsist\r\nreadily, and it should also keep as much concentrated as possible, to be\r\nready for the enemy should he show himself; and these two conditions are\r\nby no means easily reconciled. There is no better arrangement than to\r\nplace the divisions of the army in a space nearly a square, so that in\r\ncase of need the whole may be assembled at any point where the enemy may\r\npresent himself. Nine divisions placed in this way, a half-day's march\r\nfrom each other, may in twelve hours assemble on the center. The same\r\nrules are to be observed in these cases as were laid down for winter\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XL.\r\n\r\nDescents.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are operations of rare occurrence, and may be classed as among the\r\nmost difficult in war when effected in presence of a well-prepared\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nSince the invention of gunpowder and the changes effected by it in\r\nnavies, transports are so helpless in presence of the monstrous\r\nthree-deckers of the present day, armed as they are with a hundred\r\ncannon, that an army can make a descent only with the assistance of a\r\nnumerous fleet of ships of war which can command the sea, at least until\r\nthe debarkation of the army takes place.\r\n\r\nBefore the invention of gunpowder, the transports were also the ships of\r\nwar; they were moved along at pleasure by using oars, were light, and\r\ncould skirt along the coasts; their number was in proportion to the\r\nnumber of troops to be embarked; and, aside from the danger of tempests,\r\nthe operations of a fleet could be arranged with almost as much\r\ncertainty as those of an army on land. Ancient history, for these\r\nreasons, gives us examples of more extensive debarkations than modern\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nWho does not recall to mind the immense forces transported by the\r\nPersians upon the Black Sea, the Bosporus, and the Archipelago,--the\r\ninnumerable hosts landed in Greece by Xerxes and Darius,--the great\r\nexpeditions of the Carthaginians and Romans to Spain and Sicily, that of\r\nAlexander into Asia Minor, those of Cæsar to England and Africa, that\r\nof Germanicus to the mouths of the Elbe,--the Crusades,--the expeditions\r\nof the Northmen to England, to France, and even to Italy?\r\n\r\nSince the invention of cannon, the too celebrated Armada of Philip II.\r\nwas the only enterprise of this kind of any magnitude until that set on\r\nfoot by Napoleon against England in 1803. All other marine expeditions\r\nwere of no great extent: as, for example, those of Charles V. and of\r\nSebastian of Portugal to the coast of Africa; also the several descents\r\nof the French into the United States of America, into Egypt and St.\r\nDomingo, of the English to Egypt, Holland, Copenhagen, Antwerp,\r\nPhiladelphia. I say nothing of Hoche's projected landing in Ireland; for\r\nthat was a failure, and is, at the same time, an example of the\r\ndifficulties to be apprehended in such attempts.\r\n\r\nThe large armies kept on foot in our day by the great states of the\r\nworld prevent descents with thirty or forty thousand men, except against\r\nsecond-rate powers; for it is extremely difficult to find transportation\r\nfor one hundred or one hundred and fifty thousand men with their immense\r\ntrains of artillery, munitions, cavalry, &c.\r\n\r\nWe were, however, on the point of seeing the solution of the vast\r\nproblem of the practicability of descents in great force, if it is true\r\nthat Napoleon seriously contemplated the transportation of one hundred\r\nand sixty thousand veterans from Boulogne to the British Isles:\r\nunfortunately, his failure to execute this gigantic undertaking has left\r\nus entirely in the dark as to this grave question.\r\n\r\nIt is not impossible to collect fifty French ships-of-the-line in the\r\nChannel by misleading the English; this was, in fact, upon the point of\r\nbeing done; it is then no longer impossible, with a favorable wind, to\r\npass over the flotilla in two days and effect a landing. But what would\r\nbecome of the army if a storm should disperse the fleet of ships of war\r\nand the English should return in force to the Channel and defeat the\r\nfleet or oblige it to regain its ports?\r\n\r\nPosterity will regret, as the loss of an example to all future\r\ngenerations, that this immense undertaking was not carried through, or\r\nat least attempted. Doubtless, many brave men would have met their\r\ndeaths; but were not those men mowed down more uselessly on the plains\r\nof Swabia, of Moravia, and of Castile, in the mountains of Portugal and\r\nthe forests of Lithuania? What man would not glory in assisting to bring\r\nto a conclusion the greatest trial of skill and strength ever seen\r\nbetween two great nations? At any rate, posterity will find in the\r\npreparations made for this descent one of the most valuable lessons the\r\npresent century has furnished for the study of soldiers and of\r\nstatesmen. The labors of every kind performed on the coasts of France\r\nfrom 1803 to 1805 will be among the most remarkable monuments of the\r\nactivity, foresight, and skill of Napoleon. It is recommended to the\r\ncareful attention of young officers. But, while admitting the\r\npossibility of success for a great descent upon a coast so near as the\r\nEnglish to Boulogne, what results should be expected if this armada had\r\nhad a long sea-voyage to make? How could so many small vessels be kept\r\nmoving, even for two days and nights? To what chances of ruin would not\r\nso many frail boats be exposed in navigating the open seas! Moreover,\r\nthe artillery, munitions of war, equipments, provisions, and fresh water\r\nthat must be carried with this multitude of men require immense labor in\r\npreparation and vast means of transportation.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown clearly the difficulties attending such an\r\nexpedition, even for thirty thousand men. From known facts, it is\r\nevident that a descent can be made with this number of men in four\r\ncases:--1st, against colonies or isolated possessions; 2d, against\r\nsecond-rate powers which cannot be immediately supported from abroad;\r\n3d, for the purpose of effecting a temporary diversion, or to capture a\r\nposition which it is important to hold for a time; 4th, to make a\r\ndiversion, at once political and military, against a state already\r\nengaged in a great war, whose troops are occupied at a distance from the\r\npoint of the descent.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to lay down rules for operations of this character.\r\nAbout the only recommendations I can make are the following. Deceive\r\nthe enemy as to the point of landing; choose a spot where the vessels\r\nmay anchor in safety and the troops be landed together; infuse as much\r\nactivity as possible into the operation, and take possession of some\r\nstrong point to cover the development of the troops as they land; put on\r\nshore at once a part of the artillery, to give confidence and protection\r\nto the troops that have landed.\r\n\r\nA great difficulty in such an operation is found in the fact that the\r\ntransports can never get near the beach, and the troops must be landed\r\nin boats and rafts,--which takes time and gives the enemy great\r\nadvantages. If the sea is rough, the men to be landed are exposed to\r\ngreat risks; for what can a body of infantry do, crowded in boats,\r\ntossed about by the waves, and ordinarily rendered unfit by sea-sickness\r\nfor the proper use of their arms?\r\n\r\nI can only advise the party on the defensive not to divide his forces\r\ntoo much by attempting to cover every point. It is an impossibility to\r\nline the entire coast with batteries and battalions for its defense; but\r\nthe approaches to those places where large establishments are to be\r\nprotected must be closed. Signals should be arranged for giving prompt\r\nnotice of the point where the enemy is landing, and all the disposable\r\nforce should be rapidly concentrated there, to prevent his gaining a\r\nfirm foothold.\r\n\r\nThe configuration of coasts has a great influence upon descents and\r\ntheir prosecution. There are countries where the coasts are steep and\r\npresent few points of easy access for the ships and the troops to be\r\nlanded: these few places may be more readily watched, and the descent\r\nbecomes more difficult.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is a strategical consideration connected with descents\r\nwhich may be usefully pointed out. The same principle which forbids a\r\ncontinental army from interposing the mass of its forces between the\r\nenemy and the sea requires, on the contrary, that an army landing upon a\r\ncoast should always keep its principal mass in communication with the\r\nshore, which is at once its line of retreat and its base of supplies.\r\nFor the same reason, its first care should be to make sure of the\r\npossession of one fortified harbor/ or at least of a tongue of land\r\nwhich is convenient to a good anchorage and may be easily strengthened\r\nby fortifications, in order that in case of reverse the troops may be\r\nre-embarked without hurry and loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nLOGISTICS; OR, THE PRACTICAL ART OF MOVING ARMIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XLI.\r\n\r\nA few Remarks on Logistics in General.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs logistics simply a science of detail? Or, on the contrary, is it a\r\ngeneral science, forming one of the most essential parts of the art of\r\nwar? or is it but a term, consecrated by long use, intended to designate\r\ncollectively the different branches of staff duty,--that is to say, the\r\ndifferent means of carrying out in practice the theoretical combinations\r\nof the art?\r\n\r\nThese questions will seem singular to those persons who are firmly\r\nconvinced that nothing more remains to be said about the art of war, and\r\nbelieve it wrong to search out new definitions where every thing seems\r\nalready accurately classified. For my own part, I am persuaded that good\r\ndefinitions lead to clear ideas; and I acknowledge some embarrassment in\r\nanswering these questions which seem so simple.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier editions of this work I followed the example of other\r\nmilitary writers, and called by the name of _logistics_ the details of\r\nstaff duties, which are the subject of regulations for field-service and\r\nof special instructions relating to the corps of quartermasters. This\r\nwas the result of prejudices consecrated by time. The word _logistics_\r\nis derived, as we know, from the title of the _major général des logìs_,\r\n(translated in German by _Quartiermeister_,) an officer whose duty it\r\nformerly was to lodge and camp the troops, to give direction to the\r\nmarches of columns, and to locate them upon the ground. Logistics was\r\nthen quite limited. But when war began to be waged without camps,\r\nmovements became more complicated, and the staff officers had more\r\nextended functions. The chief of staff began to perform the duty of\r\ntransmitting the conceptions of the general to the most distant points\r\nof the theater of war, and of procuring for him the necessary documents\r\nfor arranging plans of operations. The chief of staff was called to the\r\nassistance of the general in arranging his plans, to give information of\r\nthem to subordinates in orders and instructions, to explain them and to\r\nsupervise their execution both in their _ensemble_ and in their minute\r\ndetails: his duties were, therefore, evidently connected with all the\r\noperations of a campaign.\r\n\r\nTo be a good chief of staff, it became in this way necessary that a man\r\nshould be acquainted with all the various branches of the art of war. If\r\nthe term _logistics_ includes all this, the two works of the Archduke\r\nCharles, the voluminous treatises of Guibert, Laroche-Aymon, Bousmard,\r\nand Ternay, all taken together, would hardly give even an incomplete\r\nsketch of what logistics is; for it would be nothing more nor less than\r\nthe science of applying all possible military knowledge.\r\n\r\nIt appears from what has been said that the old term _logistics_ is\r\ninsufficient to designate the duties of staff officers, and that the\r\nreal duties of a corps of such officers, if an attempt be made to\r\ninstruct them in a proper manner for their performance, should be\r\naccurately prescribed by special regulations in accordance with the\r\ngeneral principles of the art. Governments should take the precaution to\r\npublish well-considered regulations, which should define all the duties\r\nof staff officers and should give clear and accurate instructions as to\r\nthe best methods of performing these duties.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian staff formerly had such a code of regulations for their\r\ngovernment; but it was somewhat behind the times, and was better adapted\r\nto the old methods of carrying on war than the present. This is the only\r\nwork of the kind I have seen. There are, no doubt, others, both public\r\nand secret; but I have no knowledge of their existence. Several\r\ngenerals--as, for instance, Grimoard and Thiebaut--have prepared\r\nmanuals for staff officers, and the new royal corps of France has issued\r\nseveral partial sets of instructions; but there is nowhere to be found a\r\ncomplete manual on the subject.\r\n\r\nIf it is agreed that the old _logistics_ had reference only to details\r\nof marches and camps, and, moreover, that the functions of staff\r\nofficers at the present day are intimately connected with the most\r\nimportant strategical combinations, it must be admitted that logistics\r\nincludes but a small part of the duties of staff officers; and if we\r\nretain the term we must understand it to be greatly extended and\r\ndeveloped in signification, so as to embrace not only the duties of\r\nordinary staff officers, but of generals-in-chief.\r\n\r\nTo convince my readers of this fact, I will mention the principal points\r\nthat must be included if we wish to embrace in one view every duty and\r\ndetail relating to the movements of armies and the undertakings\r\nresulting from such movements:--\r\n\r\n     1. The preparation of all the material necessary for setting the\r\n     army in motion, or, in other words, for opening the campaign.\r\n     Drawing up orders, instructions, and itineraries for the assemblage\r\n     of the army and its subsequent launching upon its theater of\r\n     operations.\r\n\r\n     2. Drawing up in a proper manner the orders of the general-in-chief\r\n     for different enterprises, as well as plans of attack in expected\r\n     battles.\r\n\r\n     3. Arranging with the chiefs of engineers and artillery the\r\n     measures to be taken for the security of the posts which are to be\r\n     used as depots, as well as those to be fortified in order to\r\n     facilitate the operations of the army.\r\n\r\n     4. Ordering and directing reconnoissances of every kind, and\r\n     procuring in this way, and by using spies, as exact information as\r\n     possible of the positions and movements of the enemy.\r\n\r\n     5. Taking every precaution for the proper execution of movements\r\n     ordered by the general. Arranging the march of the different\r\n     columns, so that all may move in an orderly and connected manner.\r\n     Ascertaining certainly that the means requisite for the ease and\r\n     safety of marches are prepared. Regulating the manner and time of\r\n     halts.\r\n\r\n     6. Giving proper composition to advanced guards, rear-guards,\r\n     flankers, and all detached bodies, and preparing good instructions\r\n     for their guidance. Providing all the means necessary for the\r\n     performance of their duties.\r\n\r\n     7. Prescribing forms and instructions for subordinate commanders or\r\n     their staff officers, relative to the different methods of drawing\r\n     up the troops in columns when the enemy is at hand, as well as\r\n     their formation in the most appropriate manner when the army is to\r\n     engage in battle, according to the nature of the ground and the\r\n     character of the enemy.[33]\r\n\r\n     8. Indicating to advanced guards and other detachments well-chosen\r\n     points of assembly in case of their attack by superior numbers, and\r\n     informing them what support they may hope to receive in case of\r\n     need.\r\n\r\n     9. Arranging and superintending the march of trains of baggage,\r\n     munitions, provisions, and ambulances, both with the columns and in\r\n     their rear, in such manner that they will not interfere with the\r\n     movements of the troops and will still be near at hand. Taking\r\n     precautions for order and security, both on the march and when\r\n     trains are halted and parked.\r\n\r\n     10. Providing for the successive arrival of convoys of supplies.\r\n     Collecting all the means of transportation of the country and of\r\n     the army, and regulating their use.\r\n\r\n     11. Directing the establishment of camps, and adopting regulations\r\n     for their safety, good order, and police.\r\n\r\n     12. Establishing and organizing lines of operations and supplies,\r\n     as well as lines of communications with these lines for detached\r\n     bodies. Designating officers capable of organizing and commanding\r\n     in rear of the army; looking out for the safety of detachments and\r\n     convoys, furnishing them good instructions, and looking out also\r\n     for preserving suitable means of communication of the army with its\r\n     base.\r\n\r\n     13. Organizing depots of convalescent, wounded, and sickly men,\r\n     movable hospitals, and workshops for repairs; providing for their\r\n     safety.\r\n\r\n     14. Keeping accurate record of all detachments, either on the\r\n     flanks or in rear; keeping an eye upon their movements, and looking\r\n     out for their return to the main column as soon as their service on\r\n     detachment is no longer necessary; giving them, when required, some\r\n     center of action, and forming strategic reserves.\r\n\r\n     15. Organizing marching battalions or companies to gather up\r\n     isolated men or small detachments moving in either direction\r\n     between the army and its base of operations.\r\n\r\n     16. In case of sieges, ordering and supervising the employment of\r\n     the troops in the trenches, making arrangements with the chiefs of\r\n     artillery and engineers as to the labors to be performed by those\r\n     troops and as to their management in sorties and assaults.\r\n\r\n     17. In retreats, taking precautionary measures for preserving\r\n     order; posting fresh troops to support and relieve the rear-guard;\r\n     causing intelligent officers to examine and select positions where\r\n     the rear-guard may advantageously halt, engage the enemy, check his\r\n     pursuit, and thus gain time; making provision in advance for the\r\n     movement of trains, that nothing shall be left behind, and that\r\n     they shall proceed in the most perfect order, taking all proper\r\n     precautions to insure safety.\r\n\r\n     18. In cantonments, assigning positions to the different corps;\r\n     indicating to each principal division of the army a place of\r\n     assembly in case of alarm; taking measures to see that all orders,\r\n     instructions, and regulations are implicitly observed.\r\n\r\nAn examination of this long list--which might easily be made much longer\r\nby entering into greater detail--will lead every reader to remark that\r\nthese are the duties rather of the general-in-chief than of staff\r\nofficers. This truth I announced some time ago; and it is for the very\r\npurpose of permitting the general-in-chief to give his whole attention\r\nto the supreme direction of the operations that he ought to be provided\r\nwith staff officers competent to relieve him of details of execution.\r\nTheir functions are therefore necessarily very intimately connected; and\r\nwoe to an army where these authorities cease to act in concert! This\r\nwant of harmony is often seen,--first, because generals are men and have\r\nfaults, and secondly, because in every army there are found individual\r\ninterests and pretensions, producing rivalry of the chiefs of staff and\r\nhindering them in performing their duties.[34]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not to be expected that this treatise shall contain rules for the\r\nguidance of staff officers in all the details of their multifarious\r\nduties; for, in the first place, every different nation has staff\r\nofficers with different names and rounds of duties,--so that I should be\r\nobliged to write new rules for each army; in the second place, these\r\ndetails are fully entered into in special books pertaining to these\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nI will, therefore, content myself with enlarging a little upon some of\r\nthe first articles enumerated above:--\r\n\r\n1. The measures to be taken by the staff officers for preparing the army\r\nto enter upon active operations in the field include all those which are\r\nlikely to facilitate the success of the first plan of operations. They\r\nshould, as a matter of course, make sure, by frequent inspections, that\r\nthe _matériel_ of all the arms of the service is in good order: horses,\r\ncarriages, caissons, teams, harness, shoes, &c. should be carefully\r\nexamined and any deficiencies supplied. Bridge-trains, engineer-tool\r\ntrains, _matériel_ of artillery, siege-trains if they are to move,\r\nambulances,--in a word, every thing which conies under the head of\r\n_matériel_,--should be carefully examined and placed in good order.\r\n\r\nIf the campaign is to be opened in the neighborhood of great rivers,\r\ngun-boats and flying bridges should be prepared, and all the small craft\r\nshould be collected at the points and at the bank where they will\r\nprobably be used. Intelligent officers should examine the most favorable\r\npoints both for embarkations and for landings,--preferring those\r\nlocalities which present the greatest chances of success for a primary\r\nestablishment on the opposite bank.\r\n\r\nThe staff officers will prepare all the itineraries that will be\r\nnecessary for the movement of the several corps of the army to the\r\nproper points of assemblage, making every effort to give such direction\r\nto the marches that the enemy shall be unable to learn from them any\r\nthing relative to the projected enterprise.\r\n\r\nIf the war is to be offensive, the staff officers arrange with the chief\r\nengineer officers what fortifications shall be erected near the base of\r\noperations, when _têtes de ponts_ or intrenched camps are to be\r\nconstructed there. If the war is defensive, these works will be built\r\nbetween the first line of defense and the second base.\r\n\r\n2. An essential branch of logistics is certainly that which relates to\r\nmaking arrangements of marches and attacks, which are fixed by the\r\ngeneral and notice of them given to the proper persons by the chiefs of\r\nstaff. The next most important qualification of a general, after that of\r\nknowing how to form good plans, is, unquestionably, that of facilitating\r\nthe execution of his orders by their clearness of style. Whatever may be\r\nthe real business of a chief of staff, the greatness of a\r\ncommander-in-chief will be always manifested in his plans; but if the\r\ngeneral lacks ability the chief of staff should supply it as far as he\r\ncan, having a proper understanding with the responsible chief.\r\n\r\nI have seen two very different methods employed in this branch of the\r\nservice. The first, which may be styled the old school, consists in\r\nissuing daily, for the regulation of the movements of the army, general\r\ninstructions filled with minute and somewhat pedantic details, so much\r\nthe more out of place as they are usually addressed to chiefs of corps,\r\nwho are supposed to be of sufficient experience not to require the same\r\nsort of instruction as would be given to junior subalterns just out of\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nThe other method is that of the detached orders given by Napoleon to\r\nhis marshals, prescribing for each one simply what concerned himself,\r\nand only informing him what corps were to operate with him, either on\r\nthe right or the left, but never pointing out the connection of the\r\noperations of the whole army.[35] I have good reasons for knowing that\r\nhe did this designedly, either to surround his operations with an air of\r\nmystery, or for fear that more specific orders might fall into the hands\r\nof the enemy and assist him in thwarting his plans.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly of great importance for a general to keep his plans\r\nsecret; and Frederick the Great was right when he said that if his\r\nnight-cap knew what was in his head he would throw it into the fire.\r\nThat kind of secrecy was practicable in Frederick's time, when his whole\r\narmy was kept closely about him; but when maneuvers of the vastness of\r\nNapoleon's are executed, and war is waged as in our day, what concert of\r\naction can be expected from generals who are utterly ignorant of what is\r\ngoing on around them?\r\n\r\nOf the two systems, the last seems to me preferable. A judicious mean\r\nmay be adopted between the eccentric conciseness of Napoleon and the\r\nminute verbosity which laid down for experienced generals like Barclay,\r\nKleist, and Wittgenstein precise directions for breaking into companies\r\nand reforming again in line of battle,--a piece of nonsense all the more\r\nridiculous because the execution of such an order in presence of the\r\nenemy is impracticable. It would be sufficient, I think, in such cases,\r\nto give the generals special orders relative to their own corps, and to\r\nadd a few lines in cipher informing them briefly as to the whole plan of\r\nthe operations and the part they are to take individually in executing\r\nit. When a proper cipher is wanting, the order may be transmitted\r\nverbally by an officer capable of understanding it and repeating it\r\naccurately. Indiscreet revelations need then be no longer feared, and\r\nconcert of action would be secured.\r\n\r\n3. The army being assembled, and being in readiness to undertake some\r\nenterprise, the important thing will be to secure as much concert and\r\nprecision of action as possible, whilst taking all the usual\r\nprecaution's to gain accurate information of the route it is to pursue\r\nand to cover its movements thoroughly.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of marches,--those which are made out of sight of\r\nthe enemy, and those which are made in his presence, either advancing or\r\nretiring. These marches particularly have undergone great changes in\r\nlate years. Formerly, armies seldom came in collision until they had\r\nbeen several days in presence of each other, and the attacking party had\r\nroads opened by pioneers for the columns to move up parallel to each\r\nother. At present, the attack is made more promptly, and the existing\r\nroads usually answer all purposes. It is, however, of importance, when\r\nan army is moving, that pioneers and sappers accompany the advanced\r\nguard, to increase the number of practicable roads, to remove\r\nobstructions, throw small bridges over creeks, &c., if necessary, and\r\nsecure the means of easy communication between the different corps of\r\nthe army.\r\n\r\nIn the present manner of marching, the calculation of times and\r\ndistances becomes more complicated: the columns having each a different\r\ndistance to pass over, in determining the hour of their departure and\r\ngiving them instructions the following particulars must be\r\nconsidered:--1, the distances to be passed over; 2, the amount of\r\n_matériel_ in each train; 3, the nature of the country; 4, the obstacles\r\nplaced in the way by the enemy; 5, the fact whether or not it is\r\nimportant for the march to be concealed or open.\r\n\r\nUnder present circumstances, the surest and simplest method of arranging\r\nthe movements of the great corps forming the wings of an army, or of all\r\nthose corps not marching with the column attached to the general\r\nhead-quarters, will be to trust the details to the experience of the\r\ngenerals commanding those corps,--being careful, however, to let them\r\nunderstand that the most exact punctuality is expected of them. It will\r\nthen be enough to indicate to them the point to be reached and the\r\nobject to be attained, the route to be pursued and the hour at which\r\nthey will be expected to be in position. They should be informed what\r\ncorps are marching either on the same roads with them or on side-roads\r\nto the right or left in order that they may govern themselves\r\naccordingly; they should receive whatever news there may be of the\r\nenemy, and have a line of retreat indicated to them.[36]\r\n\r\nAll those details whose object it is to prescribe each day for the\r\nchiefs of corps the method of forming their columns and placing them in\r\nposition are mere pedantry,--more hurtful than useful. To see that they\r\nmarch habitually according to regulation or custom is necessary; but\r\nthey should be free to arrange their movements so as to arrive at the\r\nappointed place and time, at the risk of being removed from their\r\ncommand if they fail to do so without sufficient reason. In retreats,\r\nhowever, which are made along a single road by an army separated into\r\ndivisions, the hours of departure and halts must be carefully regulated.\r\n\r\nEach column should have its own advanced guard and flankers, that its\r\nmarch may be conducted with the usual precautions: it is convenient\r\nalso, even when they form part of a second line, for the head of each\r\ncolumn to be preceded by a few pioneers and sappers, provided with tools\r\nfor removing obstacles or making repairs in case of accidents; a few of\r\nthese workmen should also accompany each train: in like manner, a light\r\ntrestle-bridge train will be found very useful.\r\n\r\n4. The army on the march is often preceded by a general advanced guard,\r\nor, as is more frequent in the modern system, the center and each wing\r\nmay have its special advanced guard. It is customary for the reserves\r\nand the center to accompany the head-quarters; and the general advanced\r\nguard, when there is one, will usually follow the same road: so that\r\nhalf the army is thus assembled on the central route. Under these\r\ncircumstances, the greatest care is requisite to prevent obstructing the\r\nroad. It happens sometimes, however, when the important stroke is to be\r\nmade in the direction of one of the wings, that the reserves, the\r\ngeneral head-quarters, and even the general advanced guard, may be moved\r\nin that direction: in this case, all the rules usually regulating the\r\nmarch of the center must be applied to that wing.\r\n\r\nAdvanced guards should be accompanied by good staff officers, capable of\r\nforming correct ideas as to the enemy's movements and of giving an\r\naccurate account of them to the general, thus enabling him to make his\r\nplans understandingly. The commander of the advanced guard should assist\r\nthe general in the same way. A general advanced guard should be composed\r\nof light troops of all arms, containing some of the _élite_ troops of\r\nthe army as a main body, a few dragoons prepared to fight on foot, some\r\nhorse-artillery, pontoniers, sappers, &c., with light trestles and\r\npontoons for passing small streams. A few good marksmen will not be out\r\nof place. A topographical officer should accompany it, to make a sketch\r\nof the country a mile or two on each side of the road. A body of\r\nirregular cavalry should always be attached, to spare the regular\r\ncavalry and to serve as scouts, because they are best suited to such\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n5. As the army advances and removes farther from its base, it becomes\r\nthe more necessary to have a good line of operations and of depots which\r\nmay keep up the connection of the army with its base. The staff officers\r\nwill divide the depots into departments, the principal depot being\r\nestablished in the town which can lodge and supply the greatest number\r\nof men: if there is a fortress suitably situated, it should be selected\r\nas the site of the principal depot.\r\n\r\nThe secondary depots may be separated by distances of from fifteen to\r\nthirty miles, usually in the towns of the country. The mean distance\r\napart will be about twenty to twenty-five miles. This will give fifteen\r\ndepots upon a line of three hundred miles, which should be divided into\r\nthree or four brigades of depots. Each of these will have a commander\r\nand a detachment of troops or of convalescent soldiers, who regulate the\r\narrangements for accommodating troops and give protection to the\r\nauthorities of the country, (if they remain;) they furnish facilities\r\nfor transmitting the mails and the necessary escorts; the commander sees\r\nthat the roads and bridges are kept in good order. If possible, there\r\nshould be a park of several carriages at each depot, certainly at the\r\nprincipal one in each brigade. The command of all the depots embraced\r\nwithin certain geographical limits should be intrusted to prudent and\r\nable general officers; for the security of the communications of the\r\narmy often depends on their operations.[37] These commands may sometimes\r\nbecome strategic reserves, as was explained in Art. XXIII.; a few good\r\nbattalions, with the assistance of movable detachments passing\r\ncontinually between the army and the base, will generally be able to\r\nkeep open the communications.\r\n\r\n6. The study of the measures, partly logistical and partly tactical, to\r\nbe taken by the staff officers in bringing the troops from the order of\r\nmarch to the different orders of battle, is very important, but requires\r\ngoing into such minute detail that I must pass it over nearly in\r\nsilence, contenting myself with referring my readers to the numerous\r\nworks specially devoted to this branch of the art of war.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this interesting subject, I think a few examples should\r\nbe given as illustrations of the great importance of a good system of\r\nlogistics. One of these examples is the wonderful concentration of the\r\nFrench army in the plains of Gera in 1806; another is the entrance of\r\nthe army upon the campaign of 1815.\r\n\r\nIn each of these cases Napoleon possessed the ability to make such\r\narrangements that his columns, starting from points widely separated,\r\nwere concentrated with wonderful precision upon the decisive point of\r\nthe zone of operations; and in this way he insured the successful issue\r\nof the campaign. The choice of the decisive point was the result of a\r\nskillful application of the principles of strategy; and the arrangements\r\nfor moving the troops give us an example of logistics which originated\r\nin his own closet. It has been long claimed that Berthier framed those\r\ninstructions which were conceived with so much precision and usually\r\ntransmitted with so much clearness; but I have had frequent\r\nopportunities of knowing that such was not the truth. The emperor was\r\nhis own chief staff officer. Provided with a pair of dividers opened to\r\na distance by the scale of from seventeen to twenty miles in a straight\r\nline, (which made from twenty-two to twenty-five miles, taking into\r\naccount the windings of the roads,) bending over and sometimes stretched\r\nat full length upon his map, where the positions of his corps and the\r\nsupposed positions of the enemy were marked by pins of different colors,\r\nhe was able to give orders for extensive movements with a certainty and\r\nprecision which were astonishing. Turning his dividers about from point\r\nto point on the map, he decided in a moment the number of marches\r\nnecessary for each of his columns to arrive at the desired point by a\r\ncertain day; then, placing pins in the new positions, and bearing in\r\nmind the rate of marching that he must assign to each column, and the\r\nhour of its setting out, he dictated those instructions which are alone\r\nenough to make any man famous.\r\n\r\nNey coming from the shores of Lake Constance, Lannes from Upper Swabia,\r\nSoult and Davoust from Bavaria and the Palatinate, Bernadotte and\r\nAugereau from Franconia, and the Imperial Guard from Paris, were all\r\nthus arranged in line on three parallel roads, to debouch simultaneously\r\nbetween Saalfeld, Gera, and Plauen, few persons in the army or in\r\nGermany having any conception of the object of these movements which\r\nseemed so very complicated.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, in 1815, when Blücher had his army quietly in\r\ncantonments between the Sambre and the Rhine, and Wellington was\r\nattending _fêtes_ in Brussels, both waiting a signal for the invasion of\r\nFrance, Napoleon, who was supposed to be at Paris entirely engrossed\r\nwith diplomatic ceremonies, at the head of his guard, which had been\r\nbut recently reformed in the capital, fell like a thunderbolt upon\r\nCharleroi and Blücher's quarters, his columns arriving from all points\r\nof the compass, with rare punctuality, on the 14th of June, in the\r\nplains of Beaumont and upon the banks of the Sambre. (Napoleon did not\r\nleave Paris until the 12th.)\r\n\r\nThe combinations described above were the results of wise strategic\r\ncalculations, but their execution was undoubtedly a masterpiece of\r\nlogistics. In order to exhibit more clearly the merit of these measures,\r\nI will mention, by way of contrast, two cases where faults in logistics\r\ncame very near leading to fatal consequences. Napoleon having been\r\nrecalled from Spain in 1809 by the fact of Austria's taking up arms, and\r\nbeing certain that this power intended war, he sent Berthier into\r\nBavaria upon the delicate duty of concentrating the army, which was\r\nextended from Braunau as far as Strasbourg and Erfurt. Davoust was\r\nreturning from the latter city, Oudinot from Frankfort; Massena, who had\r\nbeen on his way to Spain, was retiring toward Ulm by the Strasbourg\r\nroute; the Saxons, Bavarians, and Wurtembergers were moving from their\r\nrespective countries. The corps were thus separated by great distances,\r\nand the Austrians, who had been long concentrated, might easily break\r\nthrough this spider's web or brush away its threads. Napoleon was justly\r\nuneasy, and ordered Berthier to assemble the army at Ratisbon if the war\r\nhad not actually begun on his arrival, but, if it had, to concentrate it\r\nin a more retired position toward Ulm.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this alternative order was obvious. If the war had begun,\r\nRatisbon was too near the Austrian frontier for a point of assembly, as\r\nthe corps might thus be thrown separately into the midst of two hundred\r\nthousand enemies; but by fixing upon Ulm as the point of rendezvous the\r\narmy would be concentrated sooner, or, at any rate, the enemy would have\r\nfive or six marches more to make before reaching-it,--which was a\r\nhighly-important consideration as the parties were then situated.\r\n\r\nNo great talent was needed to understand this. Hostilities having\r\ncommenced, however, but a few days after Berthier's arrival at Munich,\r\nthis too celebrated chief of staff was so foolish as to adhere to a\r\nliteral obedience of the order he had received, without conceiving its\r\nobvious intention: he not only desired the army to assemble at Ratisbon,\r\nbut even obliged Davoust to return toward that city, when that marshal\r\nhad had the good sense to fall back from Amberg toward Ingolstadt.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, having, by good fortune, been informed by telegraph of the\r\npassage of the Inn twenty-four hours after its occurrence, came with the\r\nspeed of lightning to Abensberg, just as Davoust was on the point of\r\nbeing surrounded and his army cut in two or scattered by a mass of one\r\nhundred and eighty thousand enemies. We know how wonderfully Napoleon\r\nsucceeded in rallying his army, and what victories he gained on the\r\nglorious days of Abensberg, Siegberg, Landshut, Eckmühl, and Ratisbon,\r\nthat repaired the faults committed by his chief of staff with his\r\ncontemptible logistics.\r\n\r\nWe shall finish these illustrations with a notice of the events which\r\npreceded and were simultaneous with the passage of the Danube before the\r\nbattle of Wagram. The measures taken to bring to a specified point of\r\nthe island of Lobau the corps of the Viceroy of Italy from Hungary, that\r\nof Marmont from Styria, that of Bernadotte from Linz, are less wonderful\r\nthan the famous imperial decree of thirty-one articles which regulated\r\nthe details of the passage and the formation of the troops in the plains\r\nof Enzersdorf, in presence of one hundred and forty thousand Austrians\r\nand five hundred cannon, as if the operation had been a military _fête_.\r\nThese masses were all assembled upon the island on the evening of the\r\n4th of July; three bridges were immediately thrown over an arm of the\r\nDanube one hundred and fifty yards wide, on a very dark night and amidst\r\ntorrents of rain; one hundred and fifty thousand men passed over the\r\nbridges, in presence of a formidable enemy, and were drawn up before\r\nmid-day in the plain, three miles in advance of the bridges which they\r\ncovered by a change of front; the whole being accomplished in less time\r\nthan might have been supposed necessary had it been a simple maneuver\r\nfor instruction and after being several times repeated. The enemy had,\r\nit is true, determined to offer no serious opposition to the passage;\r\nbut Napoleon did not know that fact, and the merit of his dispositions\r\nis not at all diminished by it.\r\n\r\nSingularly enough, however, the chief of staff, although he made ten\r\ncopies of the famous decree, did not observe that by mistake the bridge\r\nof the center had been assigned to Davoust, who had the right wing,\r\nwhilst the bridge on the right was assigned to Oudinot, who was in the\r\ncenter. These two corps passed each other in the night, and, had it not\r\nbeen for the good sense of the men and their officers, a dreadful scene\r\nof confusion might have been the result. Thanks to the supineness of the\r\nenemy, the army escaped all disorder, except that arising from a few\r\ndetachments following corps to which they did not belong. The most\r\nremarkable feature of the whole transaction is found in the fact that\r\nafter such a blunder Berthier should have received the title of Prince\r\nof Wagram.\r\n\r\nThe error doubtless originated with Napoleon while dictating his decree;\r\nbut should it not have been detected by a chief of staff who made ten\r\ncopies of the order and whose duty it was to supervise the formation of\r\nthe troops?\r\n\r\nAnother no less extraordinary example of the importance of good\r\nlogistics was afforded at the battle of Leipsic. In fighting this\r\nbattle, with a defile in rear of the army as at Leipsic, and in the\r\nmidst of low ground, wooded, and cut up by small streams and gardens, it\r\nwas highly important to have a number of small bridges, to prepare the\r\nbanks for approaching them with ease, and to stake out the roads. These\r\nprecautions would not have prevented the loss of a decisive battle; but\r\nthey would have saved the lives of a considerable number of men, as well\r\nas the guns and carriages that were abandoned on account of the disorder\r\nand of there being no roads of escape. The unaccountable blowing up of\r\nthe bridge of Lindenau was also the result of unpardonable carelessness\r\nupon the part of the staff corps, which indeed existed only in name,\r\nowing to the manner of Berthier's management of it. We must also agree\r\nthat Napoleon, who was perfectly conversant with the logistical measures\r\nof an offensive campaign, had then never seriously thought what would\r\nbe proper precautions in the event of defeat, and when the emperor was\r\npresent himself no one thought of making any arrangement for the future\r\nunless by his direction.\r\n\r\nTo complete what I proposed when I commenced this article, it becomes\r\nnecessary for me to add some remarks with reference to reconnoissances.\r\nThey are of two kinds: the first are entirely topographical and\r\nstatistical, and their object is to gain a knowledge of a country, its\r\naccidents of ground, its roads, defiles, bridges, &c., and to learn its\r\nresources and means of every kind. At the present day, when the sciences\r\nof geography, topography, and statistics are in such an advanced state,\r\nthese reconnoissances are less necessary than formerly; but they are\r\nstill very useful, and it is not probable that the statistics of any\r\ncountry will ever be so accurate that they may be entirely dispensed\r\nwith. There are many excellent books of instruction as to the art of\r\nmaking these reconnoissances, and I must direct the attention of my\r\nreaders to them.\r\n\r\nReconnoissances of the other kind are ordered when it is necessary to\r\ngain information of the movements of the enemy. They are made by\r\ndetachments of greater or less strength. If the enemy is drawn up in\r\nbattle-order, the generals-in-chief or the chiefs of staff make the\r\nreconnoissance; if he is on the march, whole divisions of cavalry may be\r\nthrown out to break through his screen of posts.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: I refer here to general instructions and forms, which are\r\nnot to be repeated every day: such repetition would be impracticable.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: The chiefs of artillery, of engineers, and of the\r\nadministrative departments all claim to have direct connection with the\r\ngeneral-in-chief, and not with the chief of staff. There should, of\r\ncourse, be no hinderance to the freest intercourse between these high\r\nofficers and the commander; but he should work with them in presence of\r\nthe chief of staff, and send him all their correspondence: otherwise,\r\nconfusion is inevitable.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: I believe that at the passage of the Danube before Wagram,\r\nand at the opening of the second campaign of 1813, Napoleon deviated\r\nfrom his usual custom by issuing a general order.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: Napoleon never did this, because he maintained that no\r\ngeneral should ever think seriously of the possibility of being beaten.\r\nIn many marches it is certainly a useless precaution; but it is often\r\nindispensable.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: It may be objected that in some wars, as where the\r\npopulation is hostile, it may be very difficult, or impracticable, to\r\norganize lines of depots. In such cases they will certainly be exposed\r\nto great dangers; but these are the very cases where they are most\r\nnecessary and should be most numerous. The line from Bayonne to Madrid\r\nwas such a line, which resisted for four years the attacks of the\r\nguerrillas,--although convoys were sometimes seized. At one time the\r\nline extended as far as Cadiz.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XLII.\r\n\r\nOf Reconnoissances and other Means of gaining Correct Information of\r\nthe Movements of the Enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the surest ways of forming good combinations in war would be to\r\norder movements only after obtaining perfect information of the enemy's\r\nproceedings. In fact, how can any man say what he should do himself, if\r\nhe is ignorant what his adversary is about? As it is unquestionably of\r\nthe highest importance to gain this information, so it is a thing of the\r\nutmost difficulty, not to say impossibility; and this is one of the\r\nchief causes of the great difference between the theory and the practice\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nFrom this cause arise the mistakes of those generals who are simply\r\nlearned men without a natural talent for war, and who have not acquired\r\nthat practical _coup-d'oeil_ which is imparted by long experience in the\r\ndirection of military operations. It is a very easy matter for a\r\nschool-man to make a plan for outflanking a wing or threatening a line\r\nof communications upon a map, where he can regulate the positions of\r\nboth parties to suit himself; but when he has opposed to him a skillful,\r\nactive, and enterprising adversary, whose movements are a perfect\r\nriddle, then his difficulties begin, and we see an exhibition of the\r\nincapacity of an ordinary general with none of the resources of genius.\r\n\r\nI have seen so many proofs of this truth in my long life, that, if I had\r\nto put a general to the test, I should have a much higher regard for the\r\nman who could form sound conclusions as to the movements of the enemy\r\nthan for him who could make a grand display of theories,--things so\r\ndifficult to put in practice, but so easily understood when once\r\nexemplified.\r\n\r\nThere are four means of obtaining information of the enemy's operations.\r\nThe first is a well-arranged system of espionage; the second consists in\r\nreconnoissances made by skillful officers and light troops; the third,\r\nin questioning prisoners of war; the fourth, in forming hypotheses of\r\nprobabilities. This last idea I will enlarge upon farther on. There is\r\nalso a fifth method,--that of signals. Although this is used rather for\r\nindicating the presence of the enemy than for forming conclusions as to\r\nhis designs, it may be classed with the others.\r\n\r\nSpies will enable a general to learn more surely than by any other\r\nagency what is going on in the midst of the enemy's camps; for\r\nreconnoissances, however well made, can give no information of any thing\r\nbeyond the line of the advanced guard. I do not mean to say that they\r\nshould not be resorted to, for we must use every means of gaining\r\ninformation; but I do say that their results are small and not to be\r\ndepended upon. Reports of prisoners are often useful, but it is\r\ngenerally dangerous to credit them. A skillful chief of staff will\r\nalways be able to select intelligent officers who can so frame their\r\nquestions as to elicit important information from prisoners and\r\ndeserters.\r\n\r\nThe partisans who are sent to hang around the enemy's lines of\r\noperations may doubtless learn something of his movements; but it is\r\nalmost impossible to communicate with them and receive the information\r\nthey possess. An extensive system of espionage will generally be\r\nsuccessful: it is, however, difficult for a spy to penetrate to the\r\ngeneral's closet and learn the secret plans he may form: it is best for\r\nhim, therefore, to limit himself to information of what he sees with his\r\nown eyes or hears from reliable persons. Even when the general receives\r\nfrom his spies information of movements, he still knows nothing of those\r\nwhich may since have taken place, nor of what the enemy is going finally\r\nto attempt. Suppose, for example, he learns that such a corps has passed\r\nthrough Jena toward Weimar, and that another has passed through Gera\r\ntoward Naumburg: he must still ask himself the questions, Where are they\r\ngoing, and what enterprise are they engaged in? These things the most\r\nskillful spy cannot learn.\r\n\r\nWhen armies camped in tents and in a single mass, information of the\r\nenemy's operations was certain, because reconnoitering-parties could be\r\nthrown forward in sight of the camps, and the spies could report\r\naccurately their movements; but with the existing organization into\r\ncorps d'armée which either canton or bivouac, it is very difficult to\r\nlearn any thing about them. Spies may, however, be very useful when the\r\nhostile army is commanded by a great captain or a great sovereign who\r\nalways moves with the mass of his troops or with the reserves. Such, for\r\nexample, were the Emperors Alexander and Napoleon. If it was known when\r\nthey moved and what route they followed, it was not difficult to\r\nconclude what project was in view, and the details of the movements of\r\nsmaller bodies needed not to be attended to particularly.\r\n\r\nA skillful general may supply the defects of the other methods by making\r\nreasonable and well-founded hypotheses. I can with great satisfaction\r\nsay that this means hardly ever failed me. Though fortune never placed\r\nme at the head of an army, I have been chief of staff to nearly a\r\nhundred thousand men, and have been many times called into the councils\r\nof the greatest sovereigns of the day, when the question under\r\nconsideration was the proper direction to give to the combined armies of\r\nEurope; and I was never more than two or three times mistaken in my\r\nhypotheses and in my manner of solving the difficulties they offered. As\r\nI have said before, I have constantly noticed that, as an army can\r\noperate only upon the center or one extremity of its front of\r\noperations, there are seldom more than three or four suppositions that\r\ncan possibly be made. A mind fully convinced of these truths and\r\nconversant with the principles of war will always be able to form a plan\r\nwhich will provide in advance for the probable contingencies of the\r\nfuture. I will cite a few examples which have come under my own\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nIn 1806, when people in France were still uncertain as to the war with\r\nPrussia, I wrote a memoir upon the probabilities of the war and the\r\noperations which would take place.\r\n\r\nI made the three following hypotheses:--1st. The Prussians will await\r\nNapoleon's attack behind the Elbe, and will fight on the defensive as\r\nfar as the Oder, in expectation of aid from Russia and Austria; 2d. Or\r\nthey will advance upon the Saale, resting their left upon the frontier\r\nof Bohemia and defending the passes of the mountains of Franconia; 3d.\r\nOr else, expecting the French by the great Mayence road, they will\r\nadvance imprudently to Erfurt.\r\n\r\nI do not believe any other suppositions could be made, unless the\r\nPrussians were thought to be so foolish as to divide their forces,\r\nalready inferior to the French, upon the two directions of Wesel and\r\nMayence,--a useless mistake, since there had not been a French soldier\r\non the first of these roads since the Seven Years' War.\r\n\r\nThese hypotheses having been made as above stated, if any one should ask\r\nwhat course Napoleon ought to pursue, it was easy to reply \"that the\r\nmass of the French army being already assembled in Bavaria, it should be\r\nthrown upon the left of the Prussians by way of Grera and Hof, for the\r\ngordian knot of the campaign was in that direction, no matter what plan\r\nthey should adopt.\"\r\n\r\nIf they advanced to Erfurt, he could move to Gera, cut their line of\r\nretreat, and press them back along the Lower Elbe to the North Sea. If\r\nthey rested upon the Saale, he could attack their left by way of Hof and\r\nGera, defeat them partially, and reach Berlin before them by way of\r\nLeipsic. If they stood fast behind the Elbe, he must still attack them\r\nby way of Gera and Hof.\r\n\r\nSince Napoleon's direction of operations was so clearly fixed, what\r\nmattered it to him to know the details of their movements? Being certain\r\nof the correctness of these principles, I did not hesitate to announce,\r\n_a month before the war_, that Napoleon would attempt just what he did,\r\nand that if the Prussians passed the Saale battles would take place at\r\nJena and Naumburg!\r\n\r\nI relate this circumstance not from a feeling of vanity, for if that\r\nwere my motive I might mention many more of a similar character. I have\r\nonly been anxious to show that in war a plan of operations may be often\r\narranged, simply based upon the general principles of the art, without\r\nmuch attention being of necessity given to the details of the enemy's\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nReturning to our subject, I must state that the use of spies has been\r\nneglected to a remarkable degree in many modern armies. In 1813 the\r\nstaff of Prince Schwarzenberg had not a single sou for expenditure for\r\nsuch services, and the Emperor Alexander was obliged to furnish the\r\nstaff officers with funds from his own private purse to enable them to\r\nsend agents into Lusatia for the purpose of finding out Napoleon's\r\nwhereabouts. General Mack at Ulm, and the Duke of Brunswick in 1806,\r\nwere no better informed; and the French generals in Spain often suffered\r\nseverely, because it was impossible to obtain spies and to get\r\ninformation as to what was going on around them.\r\n\r\nThe Russian army is better provided than any other for gathering\r\ninformation, by the use of roving bodies of Cossacks; and history\r\nconfirms my assertion.\r\n\r\nThe expedition of Prince Koudacheff, who was sent after the battle of\r\nDresden to the Prince of Sweden, and who crossed the Elbe by swimming\r\nand marched in the midst of the French columns as far, nearly, as\r\nWittenberg, is a remarkable instance of this class. The information\r\nfurnished by the partisan troops of Generals Czernicheff, Benkendorf,\r\nDavidoff, and Seslawin was exceedingly valuable. We may recollect it was\r\nthrough a dispatch from Napoleon to the Empress Maria Louisa,\r\nintercepted near Châlons by the Cossacks, that the allies were informed\r\nof the plan he had formed of falling upon their communications with his\r\nwhole disposable force, basing his operations upon the fortified towns\r\nof Lorraine and Alsace. This highly-important piece of information\r\ndecided Blücher and Schwarzenberg to effect a junction of their armies,\r\nwhich the plainest principles of strategy had never previously brought\r\nto act in concert except at Leipsic and Brienne.\r\n\r\nWe know, also, that the warning given by Seslawin to General Doctoroff\r\nsaved him from being crushed at Borovsk by Napoleon, who had just left\r\nMoscow in retreat with his whole army. Doctoroff did not at first credit\r\nthis news,--which so irritated Seslawin that he effected the capture of\r\na French officer and several soldiers of the guard from the French\r\nbivouacs and sent them as proofs of its correctness. This warning, which\r\ndecided the march of Koutousoff to Maloi-Yaroslavitz, prevented Napoleon\r\nfrom taking the way by Kalouga, where he would have found greater\r\nfacilities for refitting his army and would have escaped the disastrous\r\ndays of Krasnoi and the Beresina. The catastrophe which befell him would\r\nthus have been lessened, though not entirely prevented.\r\n\r\nSuch examples, rare as they are, give us an excellent idea of what good\r\npartisan troops can accomplish when led by good officers.\r\n\r\nI will conclude this article with the following summary:--\r\n\r\n1. A general should neglect no means of gaining information of the\r\nenemy's movements, and, for this purpose, should make use of\r\nreconnoissances, spies, bodies of light troops commanded by capable\r\nofficers, signals, and questioning deserters and prisoners.\r\n\r\n2. By multiplying the means of obtaining information; for, no matter\r\nhow imperfect and contradictory they may be, the truth may often be\r\nsifted from them.\r\n\r\n3. Perfect reliance should be placed on none of these means.\r\n\r\n4. As it is impossible to obtain exact information by the methods\r\nmentioned, a general should never move without arranging several courses\r\nof action for himself, based upon probable hypotheses that the relative\r\nsituation of the armies enables him to make, and never losing sight of\r\nthe principles of the art.\r\n\r\nI can assure a general that, with such precautions, nothing very\r\nunexpected can befall him and cause his ruin,--as has so often happened\r\nto others; for, unless he is totally unfit to command an army, he should\r\nat least be able to form reasonable suppositions as to what the enemy is\r\ngoing to do, and fix for himself a certain line of conduct to suit each\r\nof these hypotheses.[38] It cannot be too much insisted upon that the\r\nreal secret of military genius consists in the ability to make these\r\nreasonable suppositions in any case; and, although their number is\r\nalways small, it is wonderful how much this highly-useful means of\r\nregulating one's conduct is neglected.\r\n\r\nIn order to make this article complete, I must state what is to be\r\ngained by using a system of signals. Of these there are several kinds.\r\nTelegraphic signals may be mentioned as the most important of all.\r\nNapoleon owes his astonishing success at Ratisbon, in 1809, to the fact\r\nof his having established a telegraphic communication between the\r\nhead-quarters of the army and France. He was still at Paris when the\r\nAustrian army crossed the Inn at Braunau with the intention of invading\r\nBavaria and breaking through his line of cantonments. Informed, in\r\ntwenty-four hours, of what was passing at a distance of seven hundred\r\nmiles, he threw himself into his traveling-carriage, and a week later he\r\nhad gained two victories under the walls of Ratisbon. Without the\r\ntelegraph, the campaign would have been lost. This single fact is\r\nsufficient to impress us with an idea of its value.\r\n\r\nIt has been proposed to use portable telegraphs. Such a telegraphic\r\narrangement, operated by men on horseback posted on high ground, could\r\ncommunicate the orders of the center to the extremities of a line of\r\nbattle, as well as the reports of the wings to the head-quarters.\r\nRepeated trials of it were made in Russia; but the project was given\r\nup,--for what reason, however, I have not been able to learn. These\r\ncommunications could only be very brief, and in misty weather the method\r\ncould not be depended upon. A vocabulary for such purposes could be\r\nreduced to a few short phrases, which might easily be represented by\r\nsigns. I think it a method by no means useless, even if it should be\r\nnecessary to send duplicates of the orders by officers capable of\r\ntransmitting them with accuracy. There would certainly be a gain of\r\nrapidity.[39] attempt of another kind was made in 1794, at the battle of\r\nFleurus, where General Jourdan made use of the services of a balloonist\r\nto observe and give notice of the movements of the Austrians. I am not\r\naware that he found the method a very useful one, as it was not again\r\nused; but it was claimed at the time that it assisted in gaining him the\r\nvictory: of this, however, I have great doubts.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the difficulty of having a balloonist in readiness\r\nto make an ascension at the proper moment, and of his making careful\r\nobservations upon what is going on below, whilst floating at the mercy\r\nof the winds above, has led to the abandonment of this method of gaining\r\ninformation. By giving the balloon no great elevation, sending up with\r\nit an officer capable of forming correct opinions as to the enemy's\r\nmovements, and perfecting a system of signals to be used in connection\r\nwith the balloon, considerable advantages might be expected from its\r\nuse. Sometimes the smoke of the battle, and the difficulty of\r\ndistinguishing the columns, that look like liliputians, so as to know to\r\nwhich party they belong, will make the reports of the balloonists very\r\nunreliable. For example, a balloonist would have been greatly\r\nembarrassed in deciding, at the battle of Waterloo, whether it was\r\nGrouchy or Blücher who was seen coming up by the Saint-Lambert road; but\r\nthis uncertainty need not exist where the armies are not so much mixed.\r\nI had ocular proof of the advantage to be derived from such observations\r\nwhen I was stationed in the spire of Gautsch, at the battle of Leipsic;\r\nand Prince Schwarzenberg's aid-de-camp, whom I had conducted to the same\r\npoint, could not deny that it was at my solicitation the prince was\r\nprevailed upon to emerge from the marsh between the Pleisse and the\r\nElster. An observer is doubtless more at his ease in a clock-tower than\r\nin a frail basket floating in mid-air; but steeples are not always at\r\nhand in the vicinity of battle-fields, and they cannot be transported at\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nThere is still another method of signaling, by the use of large fires\r\nkindled upon elevated points of the country. Before the invention of the\r\ntelegraph, they afforded the means of transmitting the news of an\r\ninvasion from one end of the country to the other. The Swiss have made\r\nuse of them to call the militia to arms. They have been also used to\r\ngive the alarm to winter quarters and to assemble the troops more\r\nrapidly. The signal-fires may be made still more useful if arranged so\r\nas to indicate to the corps of the army the direction of the enemy's\r\nthreatening movements and the point where they should concentrate to\r\nmeet him. These signals may also serve on sea-coasts to give notice of\r\ndescents.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is a kind of signals given to troops during an action, by\r\nmeans of military instruments. This method of signals has been brought\r\nto greater perfection in the Russian army than in any other I know of.\r\nWhile I am aware of the great importance of discovering a sure method of\r\nsetting in motion simultaneously a large mass of troops at the will of\r\nthe commander, I am convinced that it must be a long time before the\r\nproblem is solved. Signals with instruments are of little use except for\r\nskirmishers. A movement of a long line of troops may be made nearly\r\nsimultaneous by means of a shout begun at one point and passed rapidly\r\nfrom man to man; but these shouts seem generally to be a sort of\r\ninspiration, and are seldom the result of an order. I have seen but two\r\ncases of it in thirteen campaigns.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: I shall be accused, I suppose, of saying that no event in\r\nwar can ever occur which may not be foreseen and provided for. To prove\r\nthe falsity of this accusation, it is sufficient for me to cite the\r\nsurprises of Cremona, Berg-op-zoom, and Hochkirch. I am still of the\r\nopinion, however, that such events even as these might always have been\r\nanticipated, entirely or in part, as at least within the limits of\r\nprobability or possibility.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: When the above was written, the magnetic telegraph was not\r\nknown.--Translators.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nOF THE FORMATION OF TROOPS FOR BATTLE, AND THE SEPARATE OR COMBINED USE\r\nOF THE THREE ARMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XLIII.\r\n\r\nPosting Troops in Line of Battle.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving explained in Article XXX. what is to be understood by the term\r\n_line of battle_, it is proper to add in what manner it is to be formed,\r\nand how the different troops are to be distributed in it.\r\n\r\nBefore the French Revolution, all the infantry, formed in regiments and\r\nbrigades, was collected in a single battle-corps, drawn up in two lines,\r\neach of which had a right and a left wing. The cavalry was usually\r\nplaced upon the wings, and the artillery--which at this period was very\r\nunwieldy--was distributed along the front of each line. The army camped\r\ntogether, marching by lines or by wings; and, as there were two cavalry\r\nwings and two infantry wings, if the march was by wings four columns\r\nwere thus formed. When they marched by lines, (which was specially\r\napplicable to flank movements,) two columns were formed, unless, on\r\naccount of local circumstances, the cavalry or a part of the infantry\r\nhad camped in a third line,--which was rare.\r\n\r\nThis method simplified logistics very much, since it was only necessary\r\nto give such orders as the following:--\"The army will move in such\r\ndirection, by lines or by wings, by the right or by the left.\" This\r\nmonotonous but simple formation was seldom deviated from; and no better\r\ncould have been devised as war was carried on in those days.\r\n\r\nThe French attempted something new at Minden, by forming as many columns\r\nas brigades, and opening roads to bring them to the front in line,--a\r\nsimple impossibility.\r\n\r\nIf the labor of staff officers was diminished by this method of camping\r\nand marching by lines, it must be evident that if such a system were\r\napplied to an army of one hundred thousand or one hundred and fifty\r\nthousand men, there would be no end to the columns, and the result would\r\nbe the frequent occurrence of routs like that of Rossbach.\r\n\r\nThe French Revolution introduced the system of divisions, which broke up\r\nthe excessive compactness of the old formation, and brought upon the\r\nfield fractions capable of independent movement on any kind of ground.\r\nThis change was a real improvement,--although they went from one extreme\r\nto the other, by returning nearly to the legionary formation of the\r\nRomans. These divisions, composed usually of infantry, artillery, and\r\ncavalry, maneuvered and fought separately. They were very much extended,\r\neither to enable them to subsist without the use of depots, or with an\r\nabsurd expectation of prolonging the line in order to outflank that of\r\nthe enemy. The seven or eight divisions of an army were sometimes seen\r\nmarching on the same number of roads, ten or twelve miles distant from\r\neach other; the head-quarters was at the center, with no other support\r\nthan five or six small regiments of cavalry of three hundred or four\r\nhundred men each, so that if the enemy concentrated the mass of his\r\nforces against one of these divisions and beat it, the line was pierced,\r\nand the general-in-chief, having no disposable infantry reserve, could\r\ndo nothing but order a retreat to rally his scattered columns.\r\n\r\nBonaparte in his first Italian campaign remedied this difficulty, partly\r\nby the mobility of his army and the rapidity of his maneuvers, and\r\npartly by concentrating the mass of his divisions upon the point where\r\nthe decisive blow was to fall. When he became the head of the\r\ngovernment, and saw the sphere of his means and his plans constantly\r\nincreasing in magnitude, he readily perceived that a stronger\r\norganization was necessary: he avoided the extremes of the old system\r\nand the new, while still retaining the advantages of the divisional\r\nsystem. Beginning with the campaign of 1800, he organized corps of two\r\nor three divisions, which he placed under the command of\r\nlieutenant-generals, and formed of them the wings, the center, and the\r\nreserve of his army.[40]\r\n\r\nThis system was finally developed fully at the camp of Boulogne, where\r\nhe organized permanent army corps under the command of marshals, who had\r\nunder their orders three divisions of infantry, one of light cavalry,\r\nfrom thirty-six to forty pieces of cannon, and a number of sappers. Each\r\ncorps was thus a small army, able at need to act independently as an\r\narmy. The heavy cavalry was collected in a single strong reserve,\r\ncomposed of two divisions of cuirassiers, four of dragoons, and one of\r\nlight cavalry. The grenadiers and the guard formed an admirable infantry\r\nreserve. At a later period--1812--the cavalry was also organized into\r\ncorps of three divisions, to give greater unity of action to the\r\nconstantly-increasing masses of this arm. This organization was as near\r\nperfection as possible; and the grand army, that brought about such\r\ngreat results, was the model which all the armies of Europe soon\r\nimitated.\r\n\r\nSome military men, in their attempts to perfect the art, have\r\nrecommended that the infantry division, which sometimes has to act\r\nindependently, should contain three instead of two brigades, because\r\nthis number will allow one for the center and each wing. This would\r\ncertainly be an improvement; for if the division contains but two\r\nbrigades there is an open space left in the center between the brigades\r\non the wings: these brigades, having no common central support, cannot\r\nwith safety act independently of each other. Besides this, with three\r\nbrigades in a division, two may be engaged while the third is held in\r\nreserve,--a manifest advantage. But, if thirty brigades formed in ten\r\ndivisions of three brigades are better than when formed in fifteen\r\ndivisions of two brigades, it becomes necessary, in order to obtain this\r\nperfect divisional organization, to increase the numbers of the infantry\r\nby one-third, or to reduce the divisions of the army-corps from three to\r\ntwo,--which last would be a serious disadvantage, because the army-corps\r\nis much more frequently called upon to act independently than a\r\ndivision, and the subdivision into three parts is specially best for\r\nthat[41].\r\n\r\nWhat is the best organization to be given an army just setting out upon\r\na campaign will for a long time to come be a problem in logistics;\r\nbecause it is extremely difficult to maintain the original organization\r\nin the midst of the operations of war, and detachments must be sent out\r\ncontinually.\r\n\r\nThe history of the grand army of Boulogne, whose organization seemed to\r\nleave nothing farther to be desired, proves the assertion just made. The\r\ncenter under Soult, the right under Davoust, the left under Ney, and the\r\nreserve under Lannes, formed together a regular and formidable\r\nbattle-corps of thirteen divisions of infantry, without counting those\r\nof the guard and the grenadiers. Besides these, the corps of Bernadotte\r\nand Marmont detached to the right, and that of Augereau to the left,\r\nwere ready for action on the flanks. But after the passage of the Danube\r\nat Donauwerth every thing was changed. Ney, at first reinforced to five\r\ndivisions, was reduced to two; the battle-corps was divided partly to\r\nthe right and partly to the left, so that this fine arrangement was\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nIt will always be difficult to fix upon a stable organization. Events\r\nare, however, seldom so complicated as those of 1805; and Moreau's\r\ncampaign of 1800 proves that the original organization may sometimes be\r\nmaintained, at least for the mass of the army. With this view, it would\r\nseem prudent to organize an army in four parts,--two wings, a center,\r\nand a reserve. The composition of these parts may vary with the strength\r\nof the army; but in order to retain this organization it becomes\r\nnecessary to have a certain number of divisions out of the general line\r\nin order to furnish the necessary detachments. While these divisions are\r\nwith the army, they may be attached to that part which is to receive or\r\ngive the heaviest blows; or they may be employed on the flanks of the\r\nmain body, or to increase the strength of the reserve. Bach of the four\r\ngreat parts of the army may be a single corps of three or four\r\ndivisions, or two corps of two divisions each. In this last case there\r\nwould be seven corps, allowing one for the reserve; but this last corps\r\nshould contain three divisions, to give a reserve to each wing and to\r\nthe center.\r\n\r\nWith seven corps, unless several more are kept out of the general line\r\nin order to furnish detachments, it may happen that the extreme corps\r\nmay be detached, so that each wing might contain but two divisions, and\r\nfrom these a brigade might be occasionally detached to flank the march\r\nof the army, leaving but three brigades to a wing. This would be a weak\r\norder of battle.\r\n\r\nThese facts lead me to conclude that an organization of the line of\r\nbattle in four corps of three divisions of infantry and one of light\r\ncavalry, with three or four divisions for detachments, would be more\r\nstable than one of seven corps, each of two divisions.\r\n\r\nBut, as every thing depends upon the strength of the army and of the\r\nunits of which it is composed, as well as upon the character of the\r\noperations in which it may be engaged, the arrangement may be greatly\r\nvaried. I cannot go into these details, and shall simply exhibit the\r\nprincipal combinations that may result from forming the divisions in two\r\nor three brigades and the corps in two or three divisions. I have\r\nindicated the formation of two infantry corps in two lines, either one\r\nbehind the other, or side by side.

The cavalry attached to\r\nthe corps will be placed on the flanks. The brigades might be so drawn\r\nup as to have one regiment in the first line and one in the second.\r\n\r\nThe question here presents itself, whether it is ever proper to place\r\ntwo corps one behind the other, as Napoleon often did, particularly at\r\nWagram. I think that, except for the reserves, this arrangement may be\r\nused only in a position of expectation, and never as an order of battle;\r\nfor it is much better for each corps to have its own second line and its\r\nreserve than to pile up several corps, one behind the other, under\r\ndifferent commanders. However much one general may be disposed to\r\nsupport a colleague, he will always object to dividing up his troops for\r\nthat purpose; and when in the general of the first line he sees not a\r\ncolleague, but a hated rival, as too frequently happens, it is probable\r\nhe will be very slow in furnishing the assistance which may be greatly\r\nneeded. Moreover, a commander whose troops are spread out in a long line\r\ncannot execute his maneuvers with near so much facility as if his front\r\nwas only half as great and was supported by the remainder of his own\r\ntroops drawn up in rear.\r\n\r\nThe table below[42] will show that the number of men in an army will\r\nhave great influence in determining the best formation for it, and that\r\nthe subject is a complicated one.\r\n\r\nIn making our calculations, it is scarcely necessary to provide for the\r\ncase of such immense masses being in the field as were seen from 1812 to\r\n1815, when a single army contained fourteen corps varying in strength\r\nfrom two to five divisions. With such large numbers nothing better can\r\nbe proposed than a subdivision into corps of three divisions each. Of\r\nthese corps, eight would form the main body, and there would remain six\r\nfor detachments and for strengthening any point of the main line that\r\nmight require support. If this system be applied to an army of one\r\nhundred and fifty thousand men, it would be hardly practicable to employ\r\ndivisions of two brigades each where Napoleon and the allies used corps.\r\n\r\nIf nine divisions form the main body,--that is, the wings and the\r\ncenter,--and six others form the reserve and detachments, fifteen\r\ndivisions would be required, or thirty brigades,--which would make one\r\nhundred and eighty battalions, if each regiment contains three\r\nbattalions. This supposition brings our army up to one hundred and\r\nforty-five thousand foot-soldiers and two hundred thousand in all. With\r\nregiments of two battalions there would be required one hundred and\r\ntwenty battalions, or ninety-six thousand infantry; but if each regiment\r\ncontains but two battalions, each battalion should be one thousand men\r\nstrong, and this would increase the infantry to one hundred and twenty\r\nthousand men and the entire army to one hundred and sixty thousand men.\r\nThese calculations show that the strength of the minor subdivisions must\r\nbe carefully considered in arranging into corps and divisions. If an\r\narmy does not contain more than one hundred thousand men, the formation\r\nby divisions is perhaps better than by corps. An example of this was\r\nNapoleon's army of 1800.\r\n\r\nHaving now endeavored to explain the best method of giving a somewhat\r\npermanent organization to the main body of an army, it will not be out\r\nof place for me to inquire whether this permanency is desirable, and if\r\nit is not advantageous to deceive the enemy by frequently changing the\r\ncomposition of corps and their positions.\r\n\r\nI admit the advantage of thus deceiving the enemy; but it may be gained\r\nwhile still retaining a quite constant organization of the main body. If\r\nthe divisions intended for detachments are joined to the wings and the\r\ncenter,--that is, if those parts contain each four divisions instead of\r\nthree,--and if one or two divisions be occasionally added to the wing\r\nwhich is likely to bear the brunt of an engagement, each wing will be a\r\ncorps properly of four divisions; but detachments will generally reduce\r\nit to three, and sometimes two, while it might, again, be reinforced by\r\na portion of the reserve until it reached five divisions. The enemy\r\nwould thus never know exactly the strength of the different parts of the\r\nline.\r\n\r\nBut I have dwelt sufficiently on these details. It is probable that,\r\nwhatever be the strength and number of the subdivisions of an army, the\r\norganization into corps will long be retained by all the great powers of\r\nEurope, and calculations for the arrangement of the line of battle must\r\nbe made upon that basis.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the troops in the line of battle has changed in\r\nrecent times, as well as the manner of arranging the line. Formerly it\r\nwas usually composed of two lines, but now of two lines and one or more\r\nreserves. In recent[43] conflicts in Europe, when the masses brought\r\ninto collision were very large, the corps were not only formed in two\r\nlines, but one corps was placed behind another, thus making four lines;\r\nand, the reserve being drawn up in the same manner, six lines of\r\ninfantry were often the result, and several of cavalry. Such a formation\r\nmay answer well enough as a preparatory one, but is by no means the best\r\nfor battle, as it is entirely too deep.\r\n\r\nThe classical formation--if I may employ that term--is still two lines\r\nfor the infantry. The greater or less extent of the battle-field and the\r\nstrength of an army may necessarily produce greater depth at times; but\r\nthese cases are the exceptions, because the formation of two lines and\r\nthe reserves gives sufficient solidity, and enables a greater number of\r\nmen to be simultaneously engaged.\r\n\r\nWhen an army has a permanent advanced guard, it may be either formed in\r\nfront of the line of battle or be carried to the rear to strengthen the\r\nreserve;[44] but, as has been previously stated, this will not often\r\nhappen with the present method of forming and moving armies. Each wing\r\nhas usually its own advanced guard, and the advanced guard of the main\r\nor central portion of the army is naturally furnished by the leading\r\ncorps: upon coming into view of the enemy, these advanced bodies return\r\nto their proper positions in line of battle. Often the cavalry reserve\r\nis almost entirely with the advanced guard; but this does not prevent\r\nits taking, when necessary, the place fixed for it in the line of battle\r\nby the character of the position or by the wishes of the commanding\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been stated above, my readers will gather that very great\r\nchanges of army organization took place from the time of the revival of\r\nthe art of war and the invention of gunpowder to the French Revolution,\r\nand that to have a proper appreciation of the wars of Louis XIV., of\r\nPeter the Great, and of Frederick II., they should consider them from\r\nthe stand-point of those days.\r\n\r\nOne portion of the old method may still be employed; and if, by way of\r\nexample, it may not be regarded as a fundamental rule to post the\r\ncavalry on the wings, it may still be a very good arrangement for an\r\narmy of fifty or sixty thousand men, especially when the ground in the\r\ncenter is not so suitable for the evolutions of cavalry as that near the\r\nextremities. It is usual to attach one or two brigades of light cavalry\r\nto each infantry corps, those of the center being placed in preference\r\nto the rear, whilst those of the wings are placed upon the flanks. If\r\nthe reserves of cavalry are sufficiently numerous to permit the\r\norganization of three corps of this arm, giving one as reserve to the\r\ncenter and one to each wing, the arrangement is certainly a good one. If\r\nthat is impossible, this reserve may be formed in two columns, one on\r\nthe right of the left wing and the other on the left of the right wing.\r\nThese columns may thus readily move to any point of the line that may be\r\nthreatened.[45]\r\n\r\nThe artillery of the present day has greater mobility, and may, as\r\nformerly, be distributed along the front, that of each division\r\nremaining near it. It may be observed, moreover, that, the organization\r\nof the artillery having been greatly improved, an advantageous\r\ndistribution of it may be more readily made; but it is a great mistake\r\nto scatter it too much. Few precise rules can be laid down for the\r\nproper distribution of artillery. Who, for example, would dare to advise\r\nas a rule the filling up of a large gap in a line of battle with one\r\nhundred pieces of cannon in a single battery without adequate support,\r\nas Napoleon did successfully at Wagram? I do not desire to go here into\r\nmuch detail with reference to the use of this arm, but I will give the\r\nfollowing rules:--\r\n\r\n1. The horse-artillery should be placed on such ground that it can move\r\nfreely in every direction.\r\n\r\n2. Foot-artillery, on the contrary, and especially that of heavy\r\ncaliber, will be best posted where protected by ditches or hedges from\r\nsudden charges of cavalry. It is hardly necessary for me to add--what\r\nevery young officer should know already--that too elevated positions are\r\nnot those to give artillery its greatest effect. Flat or gently-sloping\r\nground is better.\r\n\r\n3. The horse-artillery usually maneuvers with the cavalry; but it is\r\nwell for each army-corps to have its own horse-artillery, to be readily\r\nthrown into any desired position. It is, moreover, proper to have\r\nhorse-artillery in reserve, which may be carried as rapidly as possible\r\nto any threatened point. General Benningsen had great cause for\r\nself-congratulation at Eylau because he had fifty light guns in reserve;\r\nfor they had a powerful influence in enabling him to recover himself\r\nwhen his line had been broken through between the center and the left.\r\n\r\n4. On the defensive, it is well to place some of the heavy batteries in\r\nfront, instead of holding them in reserve, since it is desirable to\r\nattack the enemy at the greatest possible distance, with a view of\r\nchecking his forward movement and causing disorder in his columns.\r\n\r\n5. On the defensive, it seems also advisable to have the artillery not\r\nin reserve distributed at equal intervals in batteries along the whole\r\nline, since it is important to repel the enemy at all points. This must\r\nnot, however, be regarded as an invariable rule; for the character of\r\nthe position and the designs of the enemy may oblige the mass of the\r\nartillery to move to a wing or to the center.\r\n\r\n6. In the offensive, it is equally advantageous to concentrate a very\r\npowerful artillery-fire upon a single point where it is desired to make\r\na decisive stroke, with a view of shattering the enemy's line to such a\r\ndegree that he will be unable to withstand an attack upon which the fate\r\nof the battle is to turn. I shall at another place have more to say as\r\nto the employment of artillery in battles.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: Thus, the army of the Rhine was composed of a right wing\r\nof three divisions under Lecourbe, of a center of three divisions under\r\nSaint-Cyr, and of a left of two divisions under Saint-Suzanne, the\r\ngeneral-in-chief having three divisions more as a reserve under his own\r\nimmediate orders.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: Thirty brigades formed in fifteen divisions of two\r\nbrigades each will have only fifteen brigades in the first line, while\r\nthe same thirty brigades formed in ten divisions of three brigades each\r\nmay have twenty brigades in the first line and ten in the second. But it\r\nthen becomes necessary to diminish the number of divisions and to have\r\nbut two in a corps,--which would be a faulty arrangement, because the\r\ncorps is much more likely to be called upon for independent action than\r\nthe division.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: Every army has two wings, a center, and a reserve,--in\r\nall, four principal subdivisions,--besides accidental detachments.\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the different formations that may be given to\r\ninfantry.\r\n\r\n1st.

If they do not consist of three battalions, then each\r\nbattalion should contain one thousand men.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: The term _recent_ here refers to the later wars of\r\nNapoleon I.--Translators.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: As the advanced guard is in presence of the enemy every\r\nday, and forms the rear-guard in retreat, it seems but fair at the hour\r\nof battle to assign it a position more retired than that in front of the\r\nline of battle.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: This disposition of the cavalry, of course, is made upon\r\nthe supposition that the ground is favorably situated for it. This is\r\nthe essential condition of every well-arranged line of battle.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XLIV.\r\n\r\nFormation and Employment of Infantry.\r\n\r\n\r\nInfantry is undoubtedly the most important arm of the service, since it\r\nforms four-fifths of an army and is used both in the attack and defense\r\nof positions. If we must admit that, next to the genius of the general,\r\nthe infantry arm is the most valuable instrument in gaining a victory,\r\nit is no less true that most important aid is given by the cavalry and\r\nartillery, and that without their assistance the infantry might at times\r\nbe very seriously compromised, and at others could achieve only partial\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nWe shall not here introduce those old discussions about the shallow and\r\nthe deep formations, although the question, which was supposed decided,\r\nis far from being settled absolutely. The war in Spain and the battle of\r\nWaterloo have again given rise to disputes as to the relative advantages\r\nof fire and the shallow order, and of columns of attack and the deep\r\norder. I will give my own opinion farther on.\r\n\r\nThere must, however, be no misconception on this subject. The question\r\nnow is not whether Lloyd was right in wishing to add a fourth rank,\r\narmed with pikes, to the infantry formation, with the expectation of\r\nproducing more effect by the shock when attacking, or opposing a greater\r\nresistance when attacked. Every officer of experience knows the\r\ndifficulty of moving in an orderly manner several deployed battalions in\r\nthree ranks at close order, and that a fourth rank would increase the\r\ndisorder without adding any advantage. It is astonishing that Lloyd, who\r\nhad seen service, should have insisted so much upon the material\r\nadvantage to be gained by thus increasing the mass of a battalion; for\r\nit very rarely happens that such a collision between opposing troops\r\ntakes place that mere weight decides the contest. If three ranks turn\r\ntheir backs to the enemy, the fourth will not check them. This increase\r\nin the number of ranks diminishes the front and the number of men firing\r\nupon the defensive, whilst in the offensive there is not near so much\r\nmobility as in the ordinary column of attack. It is much more difficult\r\nto move eight hundred men in line of battle in four ranks than in three:\r\nalthough in the former case the extent of front is less, the ranks\r\ncannot be kept properly closed.\r\n\r\nLloyd's proposal for remedying this diminution of front is so absurd\r\nthat it is wonderful how a man of talents could have imagined it. He\r\nwishes to deploy twenty battalions, and leave between them one hundred\r\nand fifty yards, or an interval equal to their front. We may well ask\r\nwhat would befall those battalions thus separated. The cavalry may\r\npenetrate the intervals and scatter them like dust before the whirlwind.\r\n\r\nBut the real question now is, shall the line of battle consist of\r\ndeployed battalions depending chiefly upon their fire, or of columns of\r\nattack, each battalion being formed in column on the central division\r\nand depending on its force and impetuosity?\r\n\r\nI will now proceed to sum up the particulars bearing upon a decision of\r\nthe question in hand.\r\n\r\nThere are, in fact, only five methods of forming troops to attack an\r\nenemy:--l, as skirmishers; 2, in deployed lines, either continuous or\r\ncheckerwise; 3, in lines of battalions formed in column on the central\r\ndivisions; 4, in deep masses; 5, in small squares.\r\n\r\nThe skirmishing-order is an accessory; for the duties of skirmishers\r\nare, not to form the line of battle, but to cover it by taking advantage\r\nof the ground, to protect the movements of columns, to fill up\r\nintervals, and to defend the skirts of a position.\r\n\r\nThese different manners of formation are, therefore, reducible to four:\r\nthe shallow order, where the line is deployed in three ranks; the\r\nhalf-deep order, formed of a line of battalions in columns doubled on\r\nthe center or in battalion squares; the mixed order, where regiments are\r\npartly in line and partly in column; finally, the deep order, composed\r\nof heavy columns of battalions deployed one behind the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.[46]\r\n\r\n   Deployed order in two lines.\r\n----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----\r\n----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe formation into two deployed lines with a reserve was formerly used\r\nto a great extent: it is particularly suitable on the defensive. These\r\ndeployed lines may either be continuous, (Fig. 29,) or checkerwise, or\r\nin echelons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.\r\n\r\nTwelve battalions in columns of attack in two lines, with skirmishers in\r\nthe intervals.\r\n\r\n    -----...-----...-----...-----...-----...-----\r\n    -----   -----   -----   -----   -----   -----\r\n    -----   -----   -----   -----   -----   -----\r\n    -----   -----   -----   -----   -----   -----\r\n-----...-----...-----...-----...-----...-----\r\n-----   -----   -----   -----   -----   -----\r\n-----   -----   -----   -----   -----   -----\r\n-----   -----   -----   -----   -----   -----\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nA more compact order is shown in Fig. 30, where each battalion is formed\r\ninto a column of attack, being by divisions upon the central division.\r\nIt is really a line of small columns\r\n\r\nIn the three-rank formation, a battalion with four divisions[47] will\r\nhave twelve ranks in such a column as shown above: there are in this way\r\ntoo many non-combatants, and the column presents too good a mark for the\r\nartillery. To remedy in part these inconveniences, it has been proposed,\r\nwhenever infantry is employed in columns of attack, to form it in two\r\nranks, to place only three divisions of a battalion one behind the\r\nother, and to spread out the fourth as skirmishers in the intervals of\r\nthe battalions and upon the flanks: when the cavalry charges, these\r\nskirmishers may rally behind the other three divisions. (See Fig. 31.)\r\nEach battalion would thus have two hundred more men to fire, besides\r\nthose thrown into the two front ranks from the third. There would be,\r\nalso, an increase of the whole front. By this arrangement, while having\r\nreally a depth of but six men, there would be a front of one hundred\r\nmen, and four hundred men who could discharge their fire-arms, for each\r\nbattalion. Force and mobility would both be obtained.[48] A battalion of\r\neight hundred men, formed in the ordinary manner in a column of four\r\ndivisions, has about sixty files in each division, of which the first\r\nalone--and only two ranks of that--discharge their pieces. Bach\r\nbattalion would deliver, therefore, one hundred and twenty shots at a\r\nvolley, whilst formed in the manner shown in Fig. 31 it would deliver\r\nfour hundred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.]\r\n\r\nWhile searching after methods of obtaining more fire when necessary, we\r\nmust not forget that a column of attack is not intended to fire, and\r\nthat its fire should be reserved until the last; for if it begins to\r\nfire while marching, the whole impulsive effect of its forward movement\r\nis lost. Moreover, this shallower order would only be advantageous\r\nagainst infantry, as the column of four divisions in three\r\nranks--forming a kind of solid square--would be better against cavalry.\r\nThe Archduke Charles found it advantageous at Essling, and particularly\r\nat Wagram, to adopt this last order, which was proposed by myself in my\r\nchapter on the General Principles of War, published in 1807. The brave\r\ncavalry of Bessières could make no impression upon these small masses.\r\n\r\nTo give more solidity to the column proposed, the skirmishers might, it\r\nis true, be recalled, and the fourth division reformed; but this would\r\nbe a two-rank formation, and would offer much less resistance to a\r\ncharge than the three-rank formation,--particularly on the flanks. If to\r\nremedy this inconvenience it is proposed to form squares, many military\r\nmen believe that when in two ranks squares would not resist so well as\r\ncolumns. The English squares at Waterloo were, however, only in two\r\nranks, and, notwithstanding the heroic efforts of the French cavalry,\r\nonly one battalion was broken. I will observe, in conclusion, that, if\r\nthe two-rank formation be used for the columns of attack, it will be\r\ndifficult to preserve that in three ranks for deployed lines, as it is\r\nscarcely possible to have two methods of formation, or, at any rate, to\r\nemploy them alternately in the same engagement. It is not probable that\r\nany European army, except the English, will undertake to use deployed\r\nlines in two ranks. If they do, they should never move except in columns\r\nof attack.\r\n\r\nI conclude that the system employed by the Russians and Prussians, of\r\nforming columns of four divisions in three ranks, of which one may be\r\nemployed as skirmishers when necessary, is more generally applicable\r\nthan any other; whilst the other, of which mention has been made, would\r\nbe suitable only in certain cases and would require a double formation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.]\r\n\r\nThere is a mixed order, which was used by Napoleon at the Tagliamento\r\nand by the Russians at Eylau, where, in regiments of three battalions,\r\none was deployed to form the first line, and two others to the rear in\r\ncolumns. (See Fig. 32.) This arrangement--which belongs also to the\r\nhalf-deep order--is suitable for the offensive-defensive, because the\r\nfirst line pours a powerful fire upon the enemy, which must throw him\r\ninto more or less confusion, and the troops formed in columns may\r\ndebouch through the intervals and fall with advantage upon him while in\r\ndisorder. This arrangement would probably be improved by placing the\r\nleading divisions of the two battalions of the wings upon the same line\r\nwith the central deployed battalion. There would thus be a\r\nhalf-battalion more to each regiment in the first line,--a by no means\r\nunimportant thing for the delivery of fire. There may be reason to fear\r\nthat, these divisions becoming actively engaged in firing, their\r\nbattalions which are formed in column to be readily launched against the\r\nenemy may not be easily disengaged for that purpose. The order may be\r\nuseful in many cases. I have therefore indicated it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 33.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 34.]\r\n\r\nThe order in very deep masses (see Figs. 33 and 34) is certainly the\r\nmost injudicious. In the later wars of Napoleon, twelve battalions were\r\nsometimes deployed and closed one upon the other, forming thirty-six\r\nranks closely packed together. Such masses are greatly exposed to the\r\ndestructive effects of artillery, their mobility and impulsion are\r\ndiminished, while their strength is not increased. The use of such\r\nmasses at Waterloo was one cause of the French being defeated.\r\nMacdonald's column was more fortunate at Wagram, but at a great\r\nsacrifice of life; and it is not probable that this column would have\r\nbeen victorious had it not been for the successes of Davoust and\r\nOudinot on the left of the archduke's line.\r\n\r\nWhen it is decided to risk such a mass, the precaution should certainly\r\nbe taken of placing on each flank a battalion marching in file, so that\r\nif the enemy should charge the mass in flank it need not be arrested in\r\nits progress. (See Fig. 33.) Under the protection of these battalions,\r\nwhich may face toward the enemy, the column may continue its march to\r\nthe point it is expected to reach: otherwise, this large mass, exposed\r\nto a powerful converging fire which it has no means of returning, will\r\nbe thrown into confusion like the column at Fontenoy, or broken as was\r\nthe Macedonian phalanx by Paulus Emilius.\r\n\r\nSquares are good in plains and to oppose an enemy who has a superiority\r\nin cavalry. It is agreed that the regimental square is best for the\r\ndefensive, and the battalion square for the offensive. (See Figs. 35,\r\n36, 37.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.\r\n\r\nDivision in battalion squares.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.\r\n\r\nThe same division in long battalion squares.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.\r\n\r\nSquared of regiments of three battalions.]\r\n\r\nThe figures may be perfect squares, or elongated to give a large front\r\nand pour a heavier column of fire in the direction of the enemy. A\r\nregiment of three battalions will thus form a long square, by wheeling\r\nthe center battalion half to the right and half to the left.\r\n\r\nIn the Turkish wars squares were almost exclusively used, because\r\nhostilities were carried on in the vast plains of Bessarabia, Moldavia,\r\nor Wallachia, and the Turks had an immense force of cavalry. But if the\r\nseat of war be the Balkan Mountains or beyond them, and their irregular\r\ncavalry be replaced by an army organized according to the proportions\r\nusual in Europe, the importance of the square will disappear, and the\r\nRussian infantry will show its superiority in Rumelia.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the order in squares by regiments or battalions\r\nseems suitable for every kind of attack, when the assailant has not the\r\nsuperiority in cavalry and maneuvers on level ground advantageous for\r\nthe enemy's charges. The elongated square, especially when applied to a\r\nbattalion of eight companies, three of which would march in front and\r\none on each side, would be much better to make an attack than a deployed\r\nbattalion. It would not be so good as the column proposed above; but\r\nthere would be less unsteadiness and more impulsion than if the\r\nbattalion marched in a deployed line. It would have the advantage, also,\r\nof being prepared to resist cavalry.\r\n\r\nSquares may also be drawn up in echelons, so as entirely to unmask each\r\nother. All the orders of battle may be formed of squares as well as with\r\ndeployed lines.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be stated with truth that any one of the formations described\r\nis always good or always bad; but there is one rule to the correctness\r\nof which every one will assent,--that a formation suitable for the\r\noffensive must possess the characteristics of _solidity, mobility_, and\r\n_momentum_, whilst for the defensive _solidity_ is requisite, and also\r\nthe power of delivering _as much fire as possible_.\r\n\r\nThis truth being admitted, it remains yet to be decided whether the\r\nbravest troops, formed in columns but unable to fire, can stand long in\r\npresence of a deployed line firing twenty thousand musket-balls in one\r\nround, and able to fire two hundred thousand or three hundred thousand\r\nin five minutes. In the later wars in Europe, positions have often been\r\ncarried by Russian, French, and Prussian columns with their arms at a\r\nshoulder and without firing a shot. This was a triumph of _momentum_ and\r\nthe moral effect it produces; but under the cool and deadly fire of the\r\nEnglish infantry the French columns did not succeed so well at Talavera,\r\nBusaco, Fuentes-de-Onore, Albuera, and Waterloo.\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, necessarily conclude from these facts that the\r\nadvantage is entirely in favor of the shallow formation and firing; for\r\nwhen the French formed their infantry in those dense masses, it is not\r\nat all wonderful that the deployed and marching battalions of which they\r\nwere composed, assailed on all sides by a deadly fire, should have been\r\nrepulsed. Would the same result have been witnessed if they had used\r\ncolumns of attack formed each of a single battalion doubled on the\r\ncenter? I think not. Before deciding finally as to the superiority of\r\nthe shallow order, with its facility for firing, over the half-deep\r\norder and its momentum, there should be several trials to see how a\r\ndeployed line would stand an assault from a formation like Fig. 31,\r\n(page 293.) These small columns have always succeeded wherever I have\r\nseen them tried.\r\n\r\nIs it indeed an easy matter to adopt any other order when marching to\r\nattack a position? Can an immense deployed line be moved up into action\r\nwhile firing? I think no one will answer affirmatively. Suppose the\r\nattempt made to bring up twenty or thirty battalions in line, while\r\nfiring either by file or by company, to the assault of a well-defended\r\nposition: it is not very probable they would ever reach the desired\r\npoint, or, if they did, it would be in about as good order as a flock of\r\nsheep.\r\n\r\nWhat conclusions shall be drawn from all that has been said? 1. If the\r\ndeep order is dangerous, the half-deep is excellent for the offensive.\r\n2. The column of attack of single battalions is the best formation for\r\ncarrying a position by assault; but its depth should be diminished as\r\nmuch as possible, that it may when necessary be able to deliver as heavy\r\na column of fire as possible, and to diminish the effect of the enemy's\r\nfire: it ought also to be well covered by skirmishers and supported by\r\ncavalry. 3. The formation having the first line deployed and the second\r\nin columns is the best-suited to the defensive. 4. Either of them may be\r\nsuccessful in the hands of a general of talent, who knows how to use\r\nhis troops properly in the manner indicated in Articles XVI. and XXX.\r\n\r\nSince this chapter was first written, numerous improvements have been\r\nmade in the arms both of infantry and artillery, making them much more\r\ndestructive. The effect of this is to incline men to prefer the\r\nshallower formations, even in the attack. We cannot, however, forget the\r\nlessons of experience; and, notwithstanding the use of rocket-batteries,\r\nshrapnel-shot, and the Perkins musket, I cannot imagine a better method\r\nof forming infantry for the attack than in columns of battalions. Some\r\npersons may perhaps desire to restore to infantry the helmets and\r\nbreastplates of the fifteenth century, before leading them to the attack\r\nin deployed lines. But, if there is a general return to the deployed\r\nsystem, some better arrangement must be devised for marching to the\r\nattack than long, continuous lines, and either columns must be used with\r\nproper distances for deployment upon arriving near the enemy's position,\r\nor lines drawn up checkerwise, or the march must be by the flanks of\r\ncompanies,--all of which maneuvers are hazardous in presence of an enemy\r\nwho is capable of profiting by the advantages on his side. A skillful\r\ncommander will use either, or a combination of all, of these\r\narrangements, according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nExperience long ago taught me that one of the most difficult tactical\r\nproblems is that of determining the best formation of troops for battle;\r\nbut I have also learned that to solve this problem by the use of a\r\nsingle method is an impossibility.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the topography of different countries is very\r\nvarious. In some, as Champagne, two hundred thousand men might be\r\nmaneuvered in deployed lines. In others, as Italy, Switzerland, the\r\nvalley of the Rhine, half of Hungary, it is barely possible to deploy a\r\ndivision of ten battalions. The degree of instruction of the troops, and\r\ntheir national characteristics, may also have an influence upon the\r\nsystem of formation.\r\n\r\nOwing to the thorough discipline of the Russian army and its instruction\r\nin maneuvers of every kind, it may maintain in movements in long lines\r\nso much order and steadiness as to enable it to adopt a system which\r\nwould be entirely out of the question for the French or Prussian armies\r\nof the present day. My long experience has taught me to believe that\r\nnothing is impossible; and I do not belong to the class of men who think\r\nthat there can be but one type and one system for all armies and all\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nTo approximate as nearly as we can to the solution of the problem, it\r\nseems to me, we ought to find out:--1. The best method of moving when in\r\nsight of the enemy, but beyond his reach; 2. The best method of coming\r\nto close quarters with him; 3. The best defensive order.\r\n\r\nIn whatever manner we may settle these points, it seems desirable in all\r\ncases to exercise the troops--1. In marching in columns of battalions\r\ndoubled on the center, with a view to deployment, if necessary, when\r\ncoming into musket-range, or even to attack in column; 2. In marching in\r\ncontinuous deployed lines of eight or ten battalions; 3. In marching in\r\ndeployed battalions arranged checkerwise,--as these broken lines are\r\nmore easily moved than continuous lines; 4. In moving to the front by\r\nthe flanks of companies; 5. In marching to the front in small squares,\r\neither in line or checkerwise; 6. In changing front while using these\r\ndifferent methods of marching; 7. In changes of front executed by\r\ncolumns of companies at full distance, without deployment,--a more\r\nexpeditious method than the others of changing front, and the one best\r\nsuited to all kinds of ground.\r\n\r\nOf all the methods of moving to the front, that by the flanks of\r\ncompanies would be the best if it was not somewhat dangerous. In a plain\r\nit succeeds admirably, and in broken ground is very convenient. It\r\nbreaks up a line very much; but by accustoming the officers and privates\r\nto it, and by keeping the guides and color-bearers well aligned, all\r\nconfusion can be avoided. The only objection to it is the danger to\r\nwhich the separated companies are exposed of being ridden down by\r\ncavalry. This danger may be avoided by having good cavalry scouts, and\r\nnot using this formation too near the enemy, but only in getting over\r\nthe first part of the large interval separating the two armies. At the\r\nleast sign of the enemy's proximity the line could be reformed\r\ninstantly, since the companies can come into line at a run. Whatever\r\nprecautions may be taken, this maneuver should only be practiced with\r\nwell-disciplined troops, never with militia or raw troops. I have never\r\nseen it tried in presence of an enemy,--but frequently at drills, where\r\nit has been found to succeed well, especially in changing front.\r\n\r\nI have also seen attempts made to march deployed battalions in\r\ncheckerwise order. They succeeded well; whilst marches of the same\r\nbattalions in continuous lines did not. The French, particularly, have\r\nnever been able to march steadily in deployed lines. This checkered\r\norder would be dangerous in case of an unexpected charge of cavalry. It\r\nmay be employed in the first stages of the movement forward, to make it\r\nmore easy, and the rear battalions would then come into line with the\r\nleading ones before reaching the enemy. Moreover, it is easy to form\r\nline at the moment of the charge, by leaving a small distance only\r\nbetween the leading and following battalions; for we must not forget\r\nthat in the checkered order there are not two lines, but a single one,\r\nwhich is broken, to avoid the wavering and disorder observed in the\r\nmarches of continuous lines.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to determine positively the best formation for\r\nmaking a serious and close attack upon an enemy. Of all the methods I\r\nhave seen tried, the following seemed to succeed best. Form twenty-four\r\nbattalions in two lines of battalions in columns doubled on the center\r\nready for deployment: the first line will advance at charging-pace\r\ntoward the enemy's line to within twice musket-range, and will then\r\ndeploy at a run; the voltigeur-companies of each battalion will spread\r\nout in skirmishing-order, the remaining companies forming line and\r\npouring in a continued fire by file; the second line of columns follows\r\nthe first, and the battalions composing it pass at charging-step through\r\nthe intervals of the first line. This maneuver was executed when no\r\nenemy was present; but it seems to me an irresistible combination of the\r\nadvantages of firing and of the column.\r\n\r\nBesides these lines of columns, there are three other methods of\r\nattacking in the half-deep order.\r\n\r\nThe first is that of lines composed of deployed battalions with others\r\nin column on the wings of those deployed, (Fig. 32, page 295.) The\r\ndeployed battalions and the leading divisions of those in column would\r\nopen fire at half musket-range, and the assault would then be made. The\r\nsecond is that of advancing a deployed line and firing until reaching\r\nhalf musket-range, then throwing forward the columns of the second line\r\nthrough the intervals of the first. The third is the order in echelons,\r\nmentioned on page 193, and shown in Fig. 15 on that page.\r\n\r\nFinally, a last method is that of advancing altogether in deployed\r\nlines, depending on the superiority of fire alone, until one or the\r\nother party takes to its heels,--a case not likely to happen.\r\n\r\nI cannot affirm positively which of these methods is the best; for I\r\nhave not seen them used in actual service. In fact, in real combats of\r\ninfantry I have never seen any thing but battalions deployed commencing\r\nto fire by company, and finally by file, or else columns marching firmly\r\nagainst the enemy, who either retired without awaiting the columns, or\r\nrepulsed them before an actual collision took place, or themselves moved\r\nout to meet the advance. I have seen _mêlées_ of infantry in defiles and\r\nin villages, where the heads of columns came in actual bodily collision\r\nand thrust each other with the bayonet; but I never saw such a thing on\r\na regular field of battle.\r\n\r\nIn whatever manner these discussions terminate, they are useful, and\r\nshould be continued. It would be absurd to discard as useless the fire\r\nof infantry, as it would be to give up entirely the half-deep formation;\r\nand an army is ruined if forced to adhere to precisely the same style of\r\ntactical maneuvers in every country it may enter and against every\r\ndifferent nation. It is not so much the mode of formation as the proper\r\ncombined use of the different arms which will insure victory. I must,\r\nhowever, except very deep masses, as they should be entirely abandoned.\r\n\r\nI will conclude this subject by stating that a most vital point to be\r\nattended to in leading infantry to the combat is to protect the troops\r\nas much as possible from the fire of the enemy's artillery, not by\r\nwithdrawing them at inopportune moments, but by taking advantage of all\r\ninequalities and accidents of the ground to hide them from the view of\r\nthe enemy. When the assaulting troops have arrived within musket-range,\r\nit is useless to calculate upon sheltering them longer: the assault is\r\nthen to be made. In such cases covers are only suitable for skirmishers\r\nand troops on the defensive.\r\n\r\nIt is generally quite important to defend villages on the front of a\r\nposition, or to endeavor to take them when held by an enemy who is\r\nassailed; but their importance should not be overestimated; for we must\r\nnever forget the noted battle of Blenheim, where Marlborough and Eugene,\r\nseeing the mass of the French infantry shut up in the villages, broke\r\nthrough the center and captured twenty-four battalions which were\r\nsacrificed in defending these posts.\r\n\r\nFor like reasons, it is useful to occupy clumps of trees or brushwood,\r\nwhich may afford cover to the party holding them. They shelter the\r\ntroops, conceal their movements, cover those of cavalry, and prevent the\r\nenemy from maneuvering in their neighborhood. The case of the park of\r\nHougoumont at the battle of Waterloo is a fine example of the influence\r\nthe possession of such a position, well chosen and strongly defended,\r\nmay have in deciding the fate of a battle. At Hochkirch and Kolin the\r\npossession of the woods was very important.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: In this and subsequent figures we suppose a division of\r\ntwelve battalions.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: The word _division_ being used to designate four or five\r\nregiments, as well as two companies of a battalion, there is danger of\r\nconfusion in its use.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: In the Russian army the skirmishers are taken from the\r\nthird rank of each division,--which makes the column eight men in depth,\r\ninstead of twelve, and gives more mobility. To facilitate rallying the\r\nskirmishers on the columns, it would be, perhaps, better to take the\r\nwhole fourth division for that purpose, thus giving nine ranks, or three\r\ndivisions of three ranks, against infantry, while against cavalry there\r\nwould be twelve ranks.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XLV.\r\n\r\nCavalry.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe use a general should make of his cavalry depends, of course,\r\nsomewhat upon its numerical strength as compared with that of the whole\r\narmy, and upon its quality. Even cavalry of an inferior character may be\r\nso handled as to produce very great results, if set in action at proper\r\nmoments.\r\n\r\nThe numerical proportion of cavalry to infantry in armies has varied\r\ngreatly. It depends on the natural tastes of nations making their\r\npeople more or less fit for good troopers. The number and quality of\r\nhorses, also, have something to do with it. In the wars of the\r\nRevolution, the French cavalry, although badly organized and greatly\r\ninferior to the Austrian, performed wonders. In 1796 I saw what was\r\npompously called the cavalry reserve of the army of the Rhine,--a weak\r\nbrigade of barely fifteen hundred horses! Ten years later I saw the same\r\nreserve consisting of fifteen thousand or twenty thousand horses,--so\r\nmuch had ideas and means changed.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, it may be stated that an army in an open country\r\nshould contain cavalry to the amount of one-sixth its whole strength; in\r\nmountainous countries one-tenth will suffice.\r\n\r\nThe principal value of cavalry is derived from its rapidity and ease of\r\nmotion. To these characteristics may be added its impetuosity; but we\r\nmust be careful lest a false application be made of this last.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be its importance in the _ensemble_ of the operations of\r\nwar, cavalry can never defend a position without the support of\r\ninfantry. Its chief duty is to open the way for gaining a victory, or to\r\nrender it complete by carrying off prisoners and trophies, pursuing the\r\nenemy, rapidly succoring a threatened point, overthrowing disordered\r\ninfantry, covering retreats of infantry and artillery. An army deficient\r\nin cavalry rarely obtains a great victory, and finds its retreats\r\nextremely difficult.\r\n\r\nThe proper time and manner of bringing cavalry into action depend upon\r\nthe ideas of the commander-in-chief, the plan of the battle, the enemy's\r\nmovements, and a thousand other circumstances which cannot be mentioned\r\nhere. I can only touch upon the principal things to be considered in its\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nAll are agreed that a general attack of cavalry against a line in good\r\norder cannot be attempted with much hope of success, unless it be\r\nsupported by infantry and artillery. At Waterloo the French paid dearly\r\nfor having violated this rule; and the cavalry of Frederick the Great\r\nfared no better at Kunnersdorf. A commander may sometimes feel obliged\r\nto push his cavalry forward alone, but generally the best time for\r\ncharging a line of infantry is when it is already engaged with opposing\r\ninfantry. The battles of Marengo, Eylau, Borodino, and several others\r\nprove this.\r\n\r\nThere is one case in which cavalry has a very decided superiority over\r\ninfantry,--when rain or snow dampens the arms of the latter and they\r\ncannot fire. Augereau's corps found this out, to their sorrow, at Eylau,\r\nand so did the Austrian left at Dresden.\r\n\r\nInfantry that has been shaken by a fire of artillery or in any other way\r\nmay be charged with success. A very remarkable charge of this kind was\r\nmade by the Prussian cavalry at Hohenfriedberg in 1745. A charge against\r\nsquares of good infantry in good order cannot succeed.\r\n\r\nA general cavalry charge is made to carry batteries of artillery and\r\nenable the infantry to take the position more easily; but the infantry\r\nmust then be at hand to sustain the cavalry, for a charge of this\r\ncharacter has only a momentary effect, which must be taken advantage of\r\nbefore the enemy can return offensively upon the broken cavalry. The\r\nbeautiful charge of the French upon Gosa at the battle of Leipsic,\r\nOctober 16, is a fine example of this kind. Those executed at Waterloo\r\nwith the same object in view were admirable, but failed because\r\nunsupported. The daring charge of Ney's weak cavalry upon Prince\r\nHohenlohe's artillery at Jena is an example of what may be done under\r\nsuch circumstances.\r\n\r\nGeneral charges are also made against the enemy's cavalry, to drive it\r\nfrom the field of battle and return more free to act against his\r\ninfantry.\r\n\r\nCavalry may be successfully thrown against the flank or rear of an\r\nenemy's line at the moment of its being attacked in front by the\r\ninfantry. If repulsed, it may rally upon the army at a gallop, and, if\r\nsuccessful, it may cause the loss of the enemy's army. This operation is\r\nrarely attempted, but I see no reason why it should not be very good;\r\nfor a body of cavalry well handled cannot be cut off even if it gets in\r\nrear of the enemy. This is a duty for which light cavalry is\r\nparticularly fitted.\r\n\r\nIn the defensive, cavalry may also produce very valuable results by\r\nopportune dashes at a body of the enemy which has engaged the opposing\r\nline and either broken it through or been on the point of doing so. It\r\nmay regain the advantages lost, change the face of affairs, and cause\r\nthe destruction of an enemy flushed and disordered by his own success.\r\nThis was proved at Eylau, where the Russians made a fine charge, and at\r\nWaterloo by the English cavalry. The special cavalry of a corps d'armée\r\nmay charge at opportune moments, either to co-operate in a combined\r\nattack, or to take advantage of a false movement of the enemy, or to\r\nfinish his defeat by pressing him while in retreat.\r\n\r\nIt is not an easy matter to determine the best mode of attacking, as it\r\ndepends upon the object in view and other circumstances. There are but\r\nfour methods of charging,--in columns, in lines at a trot, in lines at a\r\ngallop, and in open order,--all of which may be successfully used. In\r\ncharges in line, the lance is very useful; in _mêlées_, the saber is\r\nmuch better: hence comes the idea of giving the lance to the front rank,\r\nwhich makes the first onslaught, and the saber to the second rank, which\r\nfinishes the encounter usually in individual combats. Pistol-firing is\r\nof very little use except for outpost-duty, in a charge as foragers, or\r\nwhen light cavalry desires to annoy infantry and draw its fire previous\r\nto a charge. I do not know what the carbine is good for; since a body of\r\ncavalry armed with it must halt if they wish to fire with any accuracy,\r\nand they are then in a favorable condition for the enemy to attack.\r\nThere are few marksmen who can with any accuracy fire a musket while on\r\nhorseback and in rapid motion.\r\n\r\nI have just said that all the methods of charging may be equally good.\r\nIt must not be understood, however, that impetuosity always gives the\r\nadvantage in a shock of cavalry against cavalry: the fast trot, on the\r\ncontrary, seems to me the best gait for charges in line, because every\r\nthing depends, in such a case, upon the _ensemble_ and good order of the\r\nmovement,--things which cannot be obtained in charges at a fast gallop.\r\nGalloping is proper against artillery when it is important to get over\r\nthe ground as rapidly as possible. In like manner, if the cavalry is\r\narmed with sabers, it may take the gallop at two hundred yards from the\r\nenemy's line if it stands firmly to receive the attack. But if the\r\ncavalry is armed with the lance, the fast trot is the proper gait, since\r\nthe advantageous use of that weapon depends upon the preservation of\r\ngood order: in a _mêlée_ the lance is almost useless.\r\n\r\nIf the enemy advances at a fast trot, it does not seem prudent to gallop\r\nto meet him; for the galloping party will be much disordered, while the\r\ntrotting party will not. The only advantage of the gallop is its\r\napparent boldness and the moral effect it produces; but, if this is\r\nestimated at its true value by the enemy, it is reasonable to expect his\r\nfirm and compact mass to be victorious over a body of horsemen galloping\r\nin confusion.\r\n\r\nIn their charges against infantry the Turks and Mamelukes showed the\r\nsmall advantage of mere impetuosity. No cavalry will penetrate where\r\nlancers or cuirassiers at a trot cannot. It is only when infantry is\r\nmuch disordered, or their fire poorly maintained, that there is any\r\nadvantage in the impetuous gallop over the steady trot. To break good\r\nsquares, cannon and lancers are required, or, better still, cuirassiers\r\narmed with lances. For charges in open order there are no better models\r\nfor imitation than the Turks and the Cossacks.\r\n\r\nWhatever method be adopted in charging, one of the best ways of using\r\ncavalry is to throw several squadrons opportunely upon the flanks of an\r\nenemy's line which is also attacked in front. That this maneuver may be\r\ncompletely successful, especially in charges of cavalry against cavalry,\r\nit should be performed at the very moment when the lines come in\r\ncollision; for a minute too soon or too late its effect may be lost. It\r\nis highly important, therefore, that a cavalry commander should have a\r\nquick eye, sound judgment, and a cool head.\r\n\r\nMuch discussion has taken place about the proper manner of arming and\r\norganizing cavalry. The lance is the best arm for offensive purposes\r\nwhen a body of horsemen charge in line; for it enables them to strike an\r\nenemy who cannot reach them; but it is a very good plan to have a\r\nsecond rank or a reserve armed with sabers, which are more easily\r\nhandled than the lance in hand-to-hand fighting when the ranks become\r\nbroken. It would be, perhaps, better still to support a charge of\r\nlancers by a detachment of hussars, who can follow up the charge,\r\npenetrate the enemy's line, and complete the victory.\r\n\r\nThe cuirass is the best defensive armor. The lance and the cuirass of\r\nstrong leather doubled seem to me the best armament for light cavalry,\r\nthe saber and iron cuirass the best for heavy cavalry. Some military men\r\nof experience are inclined even to arm the cuirassiers with lances,\r\nbelieving that such cavalry, resembling very much the men-at-arms of\r\nformer days, would bear down every thing before them. A lance would\r\ncertainly suit them better than the musketoon; and I do not see why they\r\nshould not have lances like those of the light cavalry.\r\n\r\nOpinions will be always divided as to those amphibious animals called\r\ndragoons. It is certainly an advantage to have several battalions of\r\nmounted infantry, who can anticipate an enemy at a defile, defend it in\r\nretreat, or scour a wood; but to make cavalry out of foot-soldiers, or a\r\nsoldier who is equally good on horse or on foot, is very difficult. This\r\nmight have been supposed settled by the fate of the French dragoons when\r\nfighting on foot, had it not been seen that the Turkish cavalry fought\r\nquite as well dismounted as mounted. It has been said that the greatest\r\ninconvenience resulting from the use of dragoons consists in the fact of\r\nbeing obliged at one moment to make them believe infantry squares cannot\r\nresist their charges, and the next moment that a foot-soldier armed with\r\nhis musket is superior to any horseman in the world. This argument has\r\nmore plausibility than real force; for, instead of attempting to make\r\nmen believe such contradictory statements, it would be much more\r\nreasonable to tell them that if brave cavalry may break a square, brave\r\nfoot-soldiers may resist such a charge; that victory does not always\r\ndepend upon the superiority of the arm, but upon a thousand other\r\nthings; that the courage of the troops, the presence of mind of the\r\ncommanders, the opportuneness of maneuvers, the effect of artillery and\r\nmusketry fire, rain,--mud, even,--have been the causes of repulses or of\r\nvictories; and, finally, that a brave man, whether on foot or mounted,\r\nwill always be more than a match for a coward. By impressing these\r\ntruths upon dragoons, they will believe themselves superior to their\r\nadversaries whether they fight on foot or on horseback. This is the case\r\nwith the Turks and the Circassians, whose cavalry often dismount to\r\nfight on foot in a wood or behind a cover, musket in hand, like\r\nfoot-soldiers.\r\n\r\nIt requires, however, fine material and fine commanders to bring\r\nsoldiers to such perfection in knowledge of their duties.\r\n\r\nThe conviction of what brave men can accomplish, whether on foot or\r\nmounted, doubtless induced the Emperor Nicholas to collect the large\r\nnumber of fourteen or fifteen thousand dragoons in a single corps, while\r\nhe did not consider Napoleon's unfortunate experiment with French\r\ndragoons, and was not restrained by the fear of often wanting a regiment\r\nof these troops at some particular point. It is probable that this\r\nconcentration was ordered for the purpose of giving uniformity to the\r\ninstruction of the men in their duties as foot and mounted soldiers, and\r\nthat in war they were to be distributed to the different grand divisions\r\nof the army. It cannot be denied, however, that great advantages might\r\nresult to the general who could rapidly move up ten thousand men on\r\nhorseback to a decisive point and bring them into action as infantry. It\r\nthus appears that the methods of concentration and of distribution have\r\ntheir respective advantages and disadvantages. A judicious mean between\r\nthe extremes would be to attach a strong regiment to each wing of the\r\narmy and to the advanced guard, (or the rear-guard in a retreat,) and\r\nthen to unite the remaining troops of this arm in divisions or corps.\r\n\r\nEvery thing that was said with reference to the formation of infantry is\r\napplicable to cavalry, with the following modifications:--\r\n\r\n1. Lines deployed checkerwise or in echelons are much better for cavalry\r\nthan full lines; whilst for infantry lines drawn up checkerwise are too\r\nmuch disconnected, and would be in danger if the cavalry should succeed\r\nin penetrating and taking the battalions in flank. The checkerwise\r\nformation is only advantageous for infantry in preparatory movements\r\nbefore reaching the enemy, or else for lines of columns which can defend\r\nthemselves in every direction against cavalry. Whether checkered or full\r\nlines be used, the distance between them ought to be such that if one is\r\nchecked and thrown into confusion the others may not share it. It is\r\nwell to observe that in the checkered lines the distance may be less\r\nthan for full lines. In every case the second line should not be full.\r\nIt should be formed in columns by divisions, or at least there should be\r\nleft the spaces, if in line, of two squadrons, that may be in column\r\nupon the flank of each regiment, to facilitate the passage through of\r\nthe troops which have been brought up.\r\n\r\n2. When the order of columns of attack doubled on the center is used,\r\ncavalry should be formed in regiments and infantry only in battalions.\r\nThe regiments should contain six squadrons, in order that, by doubling\r\non the center into divisions, three may be formed. If there are only\r\nfour squadrons, there can be but two lines.\r\n\r\n3. The cavalry column of attack should never be formed _en masse_ like\r\nthat of infantry; but there should always be full or half squadron\r\ndistance, that each may have room to disengage itself and charge\r\nseparately. This distance will be so great only for those troops\r\nengaged. When they are at rest behind the line of battle, they may be\r\nclosed up, in order to cover less ground and diminish the space to be\r\npassed over when brought into action. The masses should, of course, be\r\nkept beyond cannon-range.\r\n\r\n4. A flank attack being much more to be apprehended by cavalry than in a\r\ncombat of infantry with infantry, several squadrons should be formed in\r\nechelons by platoons on the flanks of a line of cavalry, which may form\r\nto the right or left, to meet an enemy coming in that direction.\r\n\r\n5. For the same reason, it is important to throw several squadrons\r\nagainst the flanks of a line of cavalry which is attacked in front.\r\nIrregular cavalry is quite as good as the regular for this purpose, and\r\nit may be better.\r\n\r\n6. It is also of importance, especially in cavalry, that the\r\ncommander-in-chief increase the depth rather than the extent of the\r\nformation. For example, in a deployed division of two brigades it would\r\nnot be a good plan for one brigade to form in a single line behind the\r\nother, but each brigade should have one regiment in the first line and\r\none in the second. Each unit of the line will thus have its own proper\r\nreserve behind it,--an advantage not to be regarded as trifling; for in\r\na charge events succeed each other so rapidly that it is impossible for\r\na general to control the deployed regiments.\r\n\r\nBy adopting this arrangement, each general of brigade will be able to\r\ndispose of his own reserve; and it would be well, also, to have a\r\ngeneral reserve for the whole division. This consideration leads me to\r\nthink that five regiments would make a good division. The charge may\r\nthen be made in line by brigades of two regiments, the fifth serving as\r\na general reserve behind the center. Or three regiments may form the\r\nline, and two may be in column, one behind each wing. Or it may be\r\npreferable to use a mixed order, deploying two regiments and keeping the\r\nothers in column. This is a good arrangement, because the three\r\nregiments, formed in columns by divisions behind the center and flanks\r\nof the line, cover those points, and can readily pass the line if it is\r\nbeaten back. (See Fig. 38.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38. Cavalry division of five regiments.\r\n\r\nCavalry deployed should be in checkered order rather than in full\r\nlines.]\r\n\r\n7. Two essential points are regarded as generally settled for all\r\nencounters of cavalry against cavalry. One is that the first line must\r\nsooner or later be checked; for, even upon the supposition of the first\r\ncharge being entirely successful, it is always probable that the enemy\r\nwill bring fresh squadrons to the contest, and the first line must at\r\nlength be forced to rally behind the second. The other point is that,\r\nwith troops and commanders on both sides equally good, the victory will\r\nremain with the party having the last squadrons in reserve in readiness\r\nto be thrown upon the flank of the enemy's line while his front is also\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\nAttention to these truths will bring us to a just conclusion as to the\r\nproper method of forming a large mass of cavalry for battle.\r\n\r\nWhatever order be adopted, care must be taken to avoid deploying large\r\ncavalry corps in full lines; for a mass thus drawn up is very\r\nunmanageable, and if the first line is checked suddenly in its career\r\nthe second is also, and that without having an opportunity to strike a\r\nblow. This has been demonstrated many times. Take as an example the\r\nattack made by Nansouty in columns of regiments upon the Prussian\r\ncavalry deployed in front of Chateau-Thierry.\r\n\r\nIn opposing the formation of cavalry in more than two lines, I never\r\nintended to exclude the use of several lines checkerwise or in echelons,\r\nor of reserves formed in columns. I only meant to say that when cavalry,\r\nexpecting to make a charge, is drawn up in lines one behind the other,\r\nthe whole mass will be thrown into confusion as soon as the first line\r\nbreaks and turns.[49]\r\n\r\nWith cavalry still more than with infantry the _morale_ is very\r\nimportant. The quickness of eye and the coolness of the commander, and\r\nthe intelligence and bravery of the soldier, whether in the _mêlée_ or\r\nin the rally, will oftener be the means of assuring a victory than the\r\nadoption of this or that formation. When, however, a good formation is\r\nadopted and the advantages mentioned above are also present, the\r\nvictory is more certain; and nothing can excuse the use of a vicious\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nThe history of the wars between 1812 and 1815 has renewed the old\r\ndisputes upon the question whether regular cavalry will in the end get\r\nthe better over an irregular cavalry which will avoid all serious\r\nencounters, will retreat with the speed of the Parthians and return to\r\nthe combat with the same rapidity, wearing out the strength of its enemy\r\nby continual skirmishing. Lloyd has decided in the negative; and several\r\nexploits of the Cossacks when engaged with the excellent French cavalry\r\nseem to confirm his opinion. (When I speak of excellent French cavalry,\r\nI refer to its impetuous bravery, and not to its perfection; for it does\r\nnot compare with the Russian or German cavalry either in horsemanship,\r\norganization, or in care of the animals.) We must by no means conclude\r\nit possible for a body of light cavalry deployed as skirmishers to\r\naccomplish as much as the Cossacks or other irregular cavalry. They\r\nacquire a habit of moving in an apparently disorderly manner, whilst\r\nthey are all the time directing their individual efforts toward a common\r\nobject. The most practiced hussars can never perform such service as the\r\nCossacks, Tscherkesses, and Turks do instinctively.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that irregular charges may cause the defeat of the\r\nbest cavalry in partial skirmishes; but it has also demonstrated that\r\nthey are not to be depended upon in regular battles upon which the fate\r\nof a war may depend. Such charges are valuable accessories to an attack\r\nin line, but alone they can lead to no decisive results.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding facts we learn that it is always best to give cavalry\r\na regular organization, and furnish them long weapons, not omitting,\r\nhowever, to provide, for skirmishing, &c., an irregular cavalry armed\r\nwith pistols, lances, and sabers.\r\n\r\nWhatever system of organization be adopted, it is certain that a\r\nnumerous cavalry, whether regular or irregular, must have a great\r\ninfluence in giving a turn to the events of a war. It may excite a\r\nfeeling of apprehension at distant parts of the enemy's country, it can\r\ncarry off his convoys, it can encircle his army, make his\r\ncommunications very perilous, and destroy the _ensemble_ of his\r\noperations. In a word, it produces nearly the same results as a rising\r\n_en masse_ of a population, causing trouble on the front, flanks, and\r\nrear of an army, and reducing a general to a state of entire uncertainty\r\nin his calculations.\r\n\r\nAny system of organization, therefore, will be a good one which provides\r\nfor great enlargement of the cavalry in time of war by the incorporation\r\nof militia; for they may, with the aid of a few good regular squadrons,\r\nbe made excellent partisan soldiers. These militia would certainly not\r\npossess all the qualities of those warlike wandering tribes who live on\r\nhorseback and seem born cavalry-soldiers; but they could in a measure\r\nsupply the places of such. In this respect Russia is much better off\r\nthan any of her neighbors, both on account of the number and quality of\r\nher horsemen of the Don, and the character of the irregular militia she\r\ncan bring into the field at very short notice.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago I made the following statements in Chapter XXXV. of the\r\nTreatise on Grand Military Operations, when writing on this subject:--\r\n\r\n\"The immense advantages of the Cossacks to the Russian army are not to\r\nbe estimated. These light troops, which are insignificant in the shock\r\nof a great battle, (except for falling upon the flanks,) are terrible in\r\npursuits and in a war of posts. They are a most formidable obstacle to\r\nthe execution of a general's designs,--because he can never be sure of\r\nthe arrival and carrying out of his orders, his convoys are always in\r\ndanger, and his operations uncertain. If an army has had only a few\r\nregiments of these half-regular cavalry-soldiers, their real value has\r\nnot been known; but when their number increases to fifteen thousand or\r\ntwenty thousand, their usefulness is fully recognized,--especially in a\r\ncountry where the population is not hostile to them.\r\n\r\n\"When they are in the vicinity, every convoy must be provided with a\r\nstrong escort, and no movement can be expected to be undisturbed. Much\r\nunusual labor is thus made necessary upon the part of the opponent's\r\nregular cavalry, which is soon broken down by the unaccustomed fatigue.\r\n\r\n\"Volunteer hussars or lancers, raised at the time of war breaking out,\r\nmay be nearly as valuable as the Cossacks, if they are well officered\r\nand move freely about from point to point.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Hungarians, Transylvanians, and Croats, Austria has resources\r\npossessed by few other states. The services rendered by mounted militia\r\nhave proved, however, that this kind of cavalry may be very useful, if\r\nfor no other purpose than relieving the regular cavalry of those\r\noccasional and extra duties to be performed in all armies, such as\r\nforming escorts, acting as orderlies, protecting convoys, serving on\r\noutposts, &c. Mixed corps of regular and irregular cavalry may often be\r\nmore really useful than if they were entirely composed of cavalry of the\r\nline,--because the fear of compromising a body of these last often\r\nrestrains a general from pushing them forward in daring operations where\r\nhe would not hesitate to risk his irregulars, and he may thus lose\r\nexcellent opportunities of accomplishing great results.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: To disprove my statement, M. Wagner cites the case of the\r\nbattle of Ramillies, where Marlborough, by a general charge of cavalry\r\nin fall lines, succeeded in beating the French drawn up checkerwise.\r\nUnless my memory deceives me, the allied cavalry was at first formed\r\ncheckered in two lines; but the real cause of Marlborough's success was\r\nhis seeing that Villeroi had paralyzed half his army behind Anderkirch\r\nand Gette, and his having the good sense to withdraw thirty-eight\r\nsquadrons from this wing to reinforce his left, which in this way had\r\ntwice as many cavalry as the French, and outflanked them. But I\r\ncheerfully admit that there may be many exceptions to a rule which I\r\nhave not laid down more absolutely than all others relating to cavalry\r\ntactics,--a tactics, by the way, as changeable as the arm itself.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XLVI.\r\n\r\nEmployment of Artillery.\r\n\r\n\r\nArtillery is an arm equally formidable both in the offensive and\r\ndefensive. As an offensive means, a great battery well managed may break\r\nan enemy's line, throw it into confusion, and prepare the way for the\r\ntroops that are to make an assault. As a defensive means, it doubles the\r\nstrength of a position, not only on account of the material injury it\r\ninflicts upon the enemy while at a distance, and the consequent moral\r\neffect upon his troops, but also by greatly increasing the peril of\r\napproaching near, and specially within the range of grape. It is no less\r\nimportant in the attack and defense of fortified places or intrenched\r\ncamps; for it is one of the main reliances in modern systems of\r\nfortification.\r\n\r\nI have already in a former portion of this book given some directions as\r\nto the distribution of artillery in a line of battle; but it is\r\ndifficult to explain definitely the proper method of using it in the\r\nbattle itself. It will not be right to say that artillery can act\r\nindependently of the other arms, for it is rather an accessory. At\r\nWagram, however, Napoleon threw a battery of one hundred pieces into the\r\ngap left by the withdrawal of Massena's corps, and thus held in check\r\nthe Austrian center, notwithstanding their vigorous efforts to advance.\r\nThis was a special case, and should not be often imitated.\r\n\r\nI will content myself with laying down a few fundamental rules,\r\nobserving that they refer to the present state of artillery service,\r\n(1838.) The recent discoveries not yet being fully tested, I shall say\r\nlittle with reference to them.\r\n\r\n1. In the offensive, a certain portion of the artillery should\r\nconcentrate its fire upon the point where a decisive blow is to be\r\nstruck. Its first use is to shatter the enemy's line, and then it\r\nassists with its fire the attack of the infantry and cavalry.\r\n\r\n2. Several batteries of horse-artillery should follow the offensive\r\nmovements of the columns of attack, besides the foot-batteries intended\r\nfor the same purpose. Too much foot-artillery should not move with an\r\noffensive column. It may be posted so as to co-operate with the column\r\nwithout accompanying it. When the cannoneers can mount the boxes, it may\r\nhave greater mobility and be advanced farther to the front.\r\n\r\n3. It has already been stated that half of the horse-artillery should be\r\nheld in reserve, that it may be rapidly moved to any required point.[50]\r\nFor this purpose it should be placed upon the most open ground, whence\r\nit can move readily in every direction. I have already indicated the\r\nbest positions for the heavy calibers.\r\n\r\n4. The batteries, whatever may be their general distribution along the\r\ndefensive line, should give their attention particularly to those points\r\nwhere the enemy would be most likely to approach, either on account of\r\nthe facility or the advantage of so doing. The general of artillery\r\nshould therefore know the decisive strategic and tactical points of the\r\nbattle-field, as well as the topography of the whole space occupied. The\r\ndistribution of the reserves of artillery will be regulated by these.\r\n\r\n5. Artillery placed on level ground or ground sloping gently to the\r\nfront is most favorably situated either for point-blank or ricochet\r\nfiring: a converging fire is the best.\r\n\r\n6. It should be borne in mind that the chief office of all artillery in\r\nbattles is to overwhelm the enemy's troops, and not to reply to their\r\nbatteries. It is, nevertheless, often useful to fire at the batteries,\r\nin order to attract their fire. A third of the disposable artillery may\r\nbe assigned this duty, but two-thirds at least should be directed\r\nagainst the infantry and cavalry of the enemy.\r\n\r\n7. If the enemy advance in deployed lines, the batteries should endeavor\r\nto cross their fire in order to strike the lines obliquely. If guns can\r\nbe so placed as to enfilade a line of troops, a most powerful effect is\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n8. When the enemy advance in columns, they may be battered in front. It\r\nis advantageous also to attack them obliquely, and especially in flank\r\nand reverse. The moral effect of a reverse fire upon a body of troops is\r\ninconceivable; and the best soldiers are generally put to flight by it.\r\nThe fine movement of Ney on Preititz at Bautzen was neutralized by a few\r\npieces of Kleist's artillery, which took his columns in flank, checked\r\nthem, and decided the marshal to deviate from the excellent direction he\r\nwas pursuing. A few pieces of light artillery, thrown at all hazards\r\nupon the enemy's flank, may produce most important results, far\r\noverbalancing the risks run.\r\n\r\n9. Batteries should always have supports of infantry or cavalry, and\r\nespecially on their flanks. Cases may occur where the rule may be\r\ndeviated from: Wagram is a very remarkable example of this.\r\n\r\n10. It is very important that artillerists, when threatened by cavalry,\r\npreserve their coolness. They should fire first solid shot, next shells,\r\nand then grape, as long as possible. The infantry supports should, in\r\nsuch a case, form squares in the vicinity, to shelter the horses, and,\r\nwhen necessary, the cannoneers. When the infantry is drawn up behind\r\nthe pieces, large squares of sufficient size to contain whatever they\r\nshould cover are best; but when the infantry is on the flanks, smaller\r\nsquares are better. Rocket-batteries may also be very efficient in\r\nfrightening the horses.\r\n\r\n11. When infantry threatens artillery, the latter should continue its\r\nfire to the last moment, being careful not to commence firing too soon.\r\nThe cannoneers can always be sheltered from an infantry attack if the\r\nbattery is properly supported. This is a case for the co-operation of\r\nthe three arms; for, if the enemy's infantry is thrown into confusion by\r\nthe artillery, a combined attack upon it by cavalry and infantry will\r\ncause its destruction.\r\n\r\n12. The proportions of artillery have varied in different wars. Napoleon\r\nconquered Italy in 1800 with forty or fifty pieces,--whilst in 1812 he\r\ninvaded Russia with one thousand pieces thoroughly equipped, and failed.\r\nThese facts show that any fixed rule on the subject is inadmissible.\r\nUsually three pieces to a thousand combatants are allowed; but this\r\nallowance will depend on circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe relative proportions of heavy and light artillery vary also between\r\nwide limits. It is a great mistake to have too much heavy artillery,\r\nwhose mobility must be much less than that of the lighter calibers. A\r\nremarkable proof of the great importance of having a strong\r\nartillery-armament was given by Napoleon after the battle of Eylau. The\r\ngreat havoc occasioned among his troops by the numerous guns of the\r\nRussians opened his eyes to the necessity of increasing his own. With\r\nwonderful vigor, he set all the Prussian arsenals to work, those along\r\nthe Rhine, and even at Metz, to increase the number of his pieces, and\r\nto cast new ones in order to enable him to use the munitions previously\r\ncaptured. In three months he doubled the _matériel_ and _personnel_ of\r\nhis artillery, at a distance of one thousand miles from his own\r\nfrontiers,--a feat without a parallel in the annals of war.\r\n\r\n13. One of the surest means of using the artillery to the best advantage\r\nis to place in command of it a general who is at once a good strategist\r\nand tactician. This chief should be authorized to dispose not only of\r\nthe reserve artillery, but also of half the pieces attached to the\r\ndifferent corps or divisions of the army. He should also consult with\r\nthe commanding general as to the moment and place of concentration of\r\nthe mass of his artillery in order to contribute most to a successful\r\nissue of the day, and he should never take the responsibility of thus\r\nmassing his artillery without previous orders from the commanding\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: Greater mobility is now given to foot-artillery by\r\nmounting the men on the boxes.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XLVII.\r\n\r\nOf the Combined Use of the Three Arms.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo conclude this Summary in a proper manner, I ought to treat of the\r\ncombined use of the three arms; but I am restrained from so doing by\r\nconsidering the great variety of points necessary to be touched upon if\r\nI should attempt to go into an examination of all the detailed\r\noperations that would arise in the application of the general rules laid\r\ndown for each of the arms.\r\n\r\nSeveral authors--chiefly German--have treated this subject very\r\nextensively, and their labors are valuable principally because they\r\nconsist mainly of citations of numerous examples taken from the actual\r\nminor engagements of the later wars. These examples must indeed take the\r\nplace of rules, since experience has shown that fixed rules on the\r\nsubject cannot be laid down. It seems a waste of breath to say that the\r\ncommander of a body of troops composed of the three arms should employ\r\nthem so that they will give mutual support and assistance; but, after\r\nall, this is the only fundamental rule that can be established, for the\r\nattempt to prescribe for such a commander a special course of conduct in\r\nevery case that may arise, when these cases may be infinitely varied,\r\nwould involve him in an inextricable labyrinth of instructions. As the\r\nobject and limits of this Summary do not allow me to enter upon the\r\nconsideration of such details, I can only refer my readers to the best\r\nworks which do treat of them.\r\n\r\nI have said all I can properly say when I advise that the different arms\r\nbe posted in conformity with the character of the ground, according to\r\nthe object in view and the supposed designs of the enemy, and that they\r\nbe used simultaneously in the manner best suited to them, care being\r\ntaken to enable them to afford mutual support. A careful study of the\r\nevents of previous wars, and especially experience in the operations of\r\nwar, will give an officer correct ideas on these points, and the ability\r\nto use, at the right time and place, his knowledge of the properties of\r\nthe three arms, either single or combined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am constrained to recapitulate the principal facts which may be\r\nregarded as fundamental in war. War in its _ensemble_ is not a science,\r\nbut an art. Strategy, particularly, may indeed be regulated by fixed\r\nlaws resembling those of the positive sciences, but this is not true of\r\nwar viewed as a whole. Among other things, combats may be mentioned as\r\noften being quite independent of scientific combinations, and they may\r\nbecome essentially dramatic, personal qualities and inspirations and a\r\nthousand other things frequently being the controlling elements. The\r\npassions which agitate the masses that are brought into collision, the\r\nwarlike qualities of these masses, the energy and talent of their\r\ncommanders, the spirit, more or less martial, of nations and\r\nepochs,[51]--in a word, every thing that can be called the poetry and\r\nmetaphysics of war,--will have a permanent influence on its results.\r\n\r\nShall I be understood as saying that there are no such things as\r\ntactical rules, and that no theory of tactics can be useful? What\r\nmilitary man of intelligence would be guilty of such an absurdity? Are\r\nwe to imagine that Eugene and Marlborough triumphed simply by\r\ninspiration or by the superior courage and discipline of their\r\nbattalions? Or do we find in the events of Turin, Blenheim, and\r\nRamillies maneuvers resembling those seen at Talavera, Waterloo, Jena,\r\nor Austerlitz, which were the causes of the victory in each case? When\r\nthe application of a rule and the consequent maneuver have procured\r\nvictory a hundred times for skillful generals, and always have in their\r\nfavor the great probability of leading to success, shall their\r\noccasional failure be a sufficient reason for entirely denying their\r\nvalue and for distrusting the effect of the study of the art? Shall a\r\ntheory be pronounced absurd because it has only three-fourths of the\r\nwhole number of chances of success in its favor?\r\n\r\nThe _morale_ of an army and its chief officers has an influence upon the\r\nfate of a war; and this seems to be due to a certain physical effect\r\nproduced by the moral cause. For example, the impetuous attack upon a\r\nhostile line of twenty thousand brave men whose feelings are thoroughly\r\nenlisted in their cause will produce a much more powerful effect than\r\nthe attack of forty thousand demoralized or apathetic men upon the same\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nStrategy, as has already been explained, is the art of bringing the\r\ngreatest part of the forces of an army upon the important point of the\r\ntheater of war or of the zone of operations.\r\n\r\nTactics is the art of using these masses at the points to which they\r\nshall have been conducted by well-arranged marches; that is to say, the\r\nart of making them act at the decisive moment and at the decisive point\r\nof the field of battle. When troops are thinking more of flight than of\r\nfight, they can no longer be termed active masses in the sense in which\r\nI use the term.\r\n\r\nA general thoroughly instructed in the theory of war, but not possessed\r\nof military _coup-d'oeil_, coolness, and skill, may make an excellent\r\nstrategic plan and be entirely unable to apply the rules of tactics in\r\npresence of an enemy: his projects will not be successfully carried out,\r\nand his defeat will be probable. If he be a man of character, he will be\r\nable to diminish the evil results of his failure, but if he lose his\r\nwits he will lose his army.\r\n\r\nThe same general may, on the other hand, be at once a good tactician and\r\nstrategist, and have made all the arrangements for gaining a victory\r\nthat his means will permit: in this case, if he be only moderately\r\nseconded by his troops and subordinate officers, he will probably gain a\r\ndecided victory. If, however, his troops have neither discipline nor\r\ncourage, and his subordinate officers envy and deceive him,[52] he will\r\nundoubtedly see his fine hopes fade away, and his admirable combinations\r\ncan only have the effect of diminishing the disasters of an almost\r\nunavoidable defeat.\r\n\r\nNo system of tactics can lead to victory when the _morale_ of an army is\r\nbad; and even when it may be excellent the victory may depend upon some\r\noccurrence like the rupture of the bridges over the Danube at Essling.\r\nNeither will victories be necessarily gained or lost by rigid adherence\r\nto or rejection of this or that manner of forming troops for battle.\r\n\r\nThese truths need not lead to the conclusion that there can be no sound\r\nrules in war, the observance of which, the chances being equal, will\r\nlead to success. It is true that theories cannot teach men with\r\nmathematical precision what they should do in every possible case; but\r\nit is also certain that they will always point out the errors which\r\nshould be avoided; and this is a highly-important consideration, for\r\nthese rules thus become, in the hands of skillful generals commanding\r\nbrave troops, means of almost certain success.\r\n\r\nThe correctness of this statement cannot be denied; and it only remains\r\nto be able to discriminate between good rules and bad. In this ability\r\nconsists the whole of a man's genius for war. There are, however,\r\nleading principles which assist in obtaining this ability. Every maxim\r\nrelating to war will be good if it indicates the employment of the\r\ngreatest portion of the means of action at the decisive moment and\r\nplace. In Chapter III. I have specified all the strategic combinations\r\nwhich lead to such a result. As regards tactics, the principal thing to\r\nbe attended to is the choice of the most suitable order of battle for\r\nthe object in view. When we come to consider the action of masses on the\r\nfield, the means to be used may be an opportune charge of cavalry, a\r\nstrong battery put in position and unmasked at the proper moment, a\r\ncolumn of infantry making a headlong charge, or a deployed division\r\ncoolly and steadily pouring upon the enemy a fire, or they may consist\r\nof tactical maneuvers intended to threaten the enemy's flanks or rear,\r\nor any other maneuver calculated to diminish the confidence of the\r\nadversary. Each of these things may, in a particular case, be the cause\r\nof victory. To define the cases in which each should be preferred is\r\nsimply impossible.\r\n\r\nIf a general desires to be a successful actor in the great drama of war,\r\nhis first duty is to study carefully the theater of operations, that he\r\nmay see clearly the relative advantages and disadvantages it presents\r\nfor himself and his enemies. This being done, he can understandingly\r\nproceed to prepare his base of operations, then to choose the most\r\nsuitable zone of operations for his main efforts, and, in doing so, keep\r\nconstantly before his mind the principles of the art of war relative to\r\nlines and fronts of operations. The offensive army should particularly\r\nendeavor to cut up the opposing army by skillfully selecting objective\r\npoints of maneuver; it will then assume, as the objects of its\r\nsubsequent undertakings, geographical points of more or less importance,\r\ndepending upon its first successes.\r\n\r\nThe defensive army, on the contrary, should endeavor, by all means, to\r\nneutralize the first forward movement of its adversary, protracting\r\noperations as long as possible while not compromising the fate of the\r\nwar, and deferring a decisive battle until the time when a portion of\r\nthe enemy's forces are either exhausted by labors, or scattered for the\r\npurpose of occupying invaded provinces, masking fortified places,\r\ncovering sieges, protecting the line of operations, depots, &c.\r\n\r\nUp to this point every thing relates to a first plan of operations; but\r\nno plan can provide with certainty for that which is uncertain\r\nalways,--the character and the issue of the first conflict. If your\r\nlines of operations have been skillfully chosen and your movements well\r\nconcealed, and if on the other hand your enemy makes false movements\r\nwhich permit you to fall on fractions of his army, you maybe successful\r\nin your campaign, without fighting general battles, by the simple use of\r\nyour strategic advantages. But if the two parties seem about equally\r\nmatched at the time of conflict, there will result one of those\r\nstupendous tragedies like Borodino, Wagram, Waterloo, Bautzen, and\r\nDresden, where the precepts of grand tactics, as indicated in the\r\nchapter on that subject, must have a powerful influence.\r\n\r\nIf a few prejudiced military men, after reading this book and carefully\r\nstudying the detailed and correct history of the campaigns of the great\r\nmasters of the art of war, still contend that it has neither principles\r\nnor rules, I can only pity them, and reply, in the famous words of\r\nFrederick, that \"a mule which had made twenty campaigns under Prince\r\nEugene would not be a better tactician than at the beginning.\"\r\n\r\nCorrect theories, founded upon right principles, sustained by actual\r\nevents of wars, and added to accurate military history, will form a true\r\nschool of instruction for generals. If these means do not produce great\r\nmen, they will at least produce generals of sufficient skill to take\r\nrank next after the natural masters of the art of war.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: The well-known Spanish proverb, _He was brave on such a\r\nday_, may be applied to nations as to individuals. The French at\r\nRossbach were not the same people as at Jena, nor the Prussians at\r\nPrentzlow as at Dennewitz.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: The unskillful conduct of a subordinate who is incapable\r\nof understanding the merit of a maneuver which has been ordered, and who\r\nwill commit grave faults in its execution, may produce the same result\r\nof causing the failure of the plans of an excellent commander.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENT\r\n\r\nTO THE\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE ART OF WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Summary of the Art of War, published in 1836, to assist in the\r\nmilitary instruction of the Hereditary Grand Duke of Russia, contained a\r\nconcluding article that was never printed. I deem it expedient to give\r\nit now in the form of a supplement, and add a special article upon the\r\nmeans of acquiring a certain and ready strategic _coup-d'oeil_.\r\n\r\nIt is essential for the reader of my Summary to understand clearly that\r\nin the military science, as in every other, the study of details is easy\r\nfor the man who has learned how to seize the fundamental features to\r\nwhich all others are secondary. I am about to attempt a development of\r\nthese elements of the art; and my readers should endeavor to apprehend\r\nthem clearly and to apply them properly.\r\n\r\nI cannot too often repeat that the theory of the great combinations of\r\nwar is in itself very simple, and requires nothing more than ordinary\r\nintelligence and careful consideration. Notwithstanding its simplicity,\r\nmany learned military men have difficulty in grasping it thoroughly.\r\nTheir minds wander off to accessory details, in place of fixing\r\nthemselves on first causes, and they go a long way in search of what is\r\njust within their reach if they only would think so.\r\n\r\nTwo very different things must exist in a man to make him a general: _he\r\nmust know how to arrange a good plan of operations, and how to carry it\r\nto a successful termination_. The first of these talents may be a\r\nnatural gift, but it may also be acquired and developed by study. The\r\nsecond depends more on individual character, is rather a personal\r\nattribute, and cannot be created by study, although it may be improved.\r\n\r\nIt is particularly necessary for a monarch or the head of a government\r\nto possess the first of these talents, because in such case, although he\r\nmay not have the ability to execute, he can arrange plans of operations\r\nand decide correctly as to the excellence or defects of those submitted\r\nto him by others. He is thus enabled to estimate properly the capacity\r\nof his generals, and when he finds a general producing a good plan, and\r\nhaving firmness and coolness, such a man may be safely trusted with the\r\ncommand of an army.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the head of a state is a man of executive\r\nability, but not possessing the faculty of arranging wise military\r\ncombinations, he will be likely to commit all the faults that have\r\ncharacterized the campaigns of many celebrated warriors who were only\r\nbrave soldiers without being at all improved by study.\r\n\r\nFrom the principles which I have laid down, and their application to\r\nseveral famous campaigns, my readers will perceive that the theory of\r\nthe great combinations of war may be summed up in the following truths.\r\n\r\nThe science of strategy consists, in the first place, in knowing how to\r\nchoose well a theater of war and to estimate correctly that of the\r\nenemy. To do this, a general must accustom himself to decide as to the\r\nimportance of decisive points,--which is not a difficult matter when he\r\nis aided by the hints I have given on the subject, particularly in\r\nArticles from XVIII. to XXII.\r\n\r\nThe art consists, next, in a proper employment of the troops upon the\r\ntheater of operations, whether offensive or defensive. (See Article\r\nXVII.) This employment of the forces should be regulated by two\r\nfundamental principles: the first being, _to obtain by free and rapid\r\nmovements the advantage of bringing the mass of the troops against\r\nfractions of the enemy; the second, to strike in the most decisive\r\ndirection_,--that is to say, in that direction where the consequences of\r\nhis defeat may be most disastrous to the enemy, while at the same time\r\nhis success would yield him no great advantages.\r\n\r\nThe whole science of great military combination is comprised in these\r\ntwo fundamental truths. Therefore, all movements that are disconnected\r\nor more extended than those of the enemy would be grave faults; so also\r\nwould the occupation of a position that was too much cut up, or sending\r\nout a large detachment unnecessarily. On the contrary, every\r\nwell-connected, compact system of operations would be wise; so also with\r\ncentral strategic lines, and every strategic position less extended than\r\nthe enemy's.\r\n\r\nThe application of these fundamental principles is also very simple. If\r\nyou have one hundred battalions against an equal number of the enemy's,\r\nyou may, by their mobility and by taking the initiative, bring eighty of\r\nthem to the decisive point while employing the remaining twenty to\r\nobserve and deceive half of the opposing army. You will thus have eighty\r\nbattalions against fifty at the point where the important contest is to\r\ntake place. You will reach this point by rapid marches, by interior\r\nlines, or by a general movement toward one extremity of the hostile\r\nline. I have indicated the cases in which one or the other of these\r\nmeans is to be preferred. (See pages 114 and following.)\r\n\r\nIn arranging a plan of operations, it is important to remember _\"that a\r\nstrategic theater, as well as every position occupied by an army, has a\r\ncenter and two extremities.\"_ A theater has usually three zones,--a\r\nright, a left, and a central.\r\n\r\nIn choosing a zone of operations, select one,--1, that will furnish a\r\nsafe and advantageous base; 2, in which the least risk will be run by\r\nyourself, while the enemy will be most exposed to injury; 3, bearing in\r\nmind the antecedent situations of the two parties, and, 4, the\r\ndispositions and inclinations of the powers whose territories are near\r\nthe theater of war.\r\n\r\nOne of the zones will always be decidedly bad or dangerous, while the\r\nother two will be more or less suitable according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe zone and base being fixed upon, the object of the first attempts\r\nmust be selected. This is choosing an objective of operations. There are\r\ntwo very different kinds: some, that are called _territorial or\r\ngeographical objectives_, refer simply to an enemy's line of defense\r\nwhich it is desired to get possession of, or a fortress or intrenched\r\ncamp to be captured; _the others, on the contrary, consist entirely in\r\nthe destruction or disorganization of the enemy's forces, without giving\r\nattention to geographical points of any kind_. This was the favorite\r\nobjective of Napoleon.[53]\r\n\r\nI can profitably add nothing to what I have already written on this\r\npoint, (page 86;) _and, as the choice of the objective is by far the\r\nmost important thing in a plan of operations_, I recommend the whole of\r\nArticle XIX., (pages 84 and following.)\r\n\r\nThe objective being determined upon, the army will move toward it by one\r\nor two lines of operations, care being taken to conform to the\r\nfundamental principle laid down, and to avoid double lines, unless the\r\ncharacter of the theater of war makes it necessary to use them, or the\r\nenemy is very inferior either in the number or the quality of his\r\ntroops. Article XXI. treats this subject fully. If two geographical\r\nlines are used, it is essential to move the great mass of the forces\r\nalong the most important of them, and to occupy the secondary line by\r\ndetachments having a concentric direction, if possible, with the main\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nThe army, being on its way toward the objective, before arriving in\r\npresence of the enemy and giving battle, occupies daily or temporary\r\nstrategic positions: the front it embraces, or that upon which the enemy\r\nmay attack, is its front of operations. There is an important\r\nconsideration with reference to the direction of the front of operations\r\nand to changes it may receive, which I have dwelt upon in Article XX.,\r\n(page 93.)\r\n\r\nThe fundamental principle requires, even when the forces are equal, that\r\nthe front be less extensive than the enemy's,--especially if the front\r\nremains unchanged for some time. If your strategic positions are more\r\nclosely connected than the enemy's, you can concentrate more rapidly and\r\nmore easily than he can, and in this way the fundamental principle will\r\nbe applied. If your positions are interior and central, the enemy cannot\r\nconcentrate except by passing by the mass of your divisions or by moving\r\nin a circle around them: he is then exactly in a condition not to be\r\nable to apply the fundamental principle, while it is your most obvious\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nBut if you are very weak and the enemy very strong, a central position,\r\nthat may be surrounded on all sides by forces superior at every point,\r\nis untenable, unless the enemy's corps are very far separated from each\r\nother, as was the case with the allied armies in the Seven Years' War;\r\nor unless the central zone has a natural barrier on one or two of its\r\nsides, like the Rhine, the Danube, or the Alps, which would prevent the\r\nenemy from using his forces simultaneously. In case of great numerical\r\ninferiority it is, nevertheless, wiser to maneuver upon one of the\r\nextremities than upon the center of the enemy's line, especially if his\r\nmasses are sufficiently near to be dangerous to you.\r\n\r\nIt was stated above that strategy, besides indicating the decisive\r\npoints of a theater of war, requires two things:--1st, that the\r\nprincipal mass of the force be moved against fractions of the enemy's,\r\nto attack them in succession; 2d, that the best direction of movement be\r\nadopted,--that is to say, one leading straight to the decisive points\r\nalready known, and afterward upon secondary points.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate these immutable principles of strategy, I will give a\r\nsketch of the operations of the French at the close of 1793. (See Plate\r\nIII.)\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that the allies had ten principal corps on the\r\nfrontier of France from the Rhine to the North Sea.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of York was attacking Dunkirk. (No. 1.)\r\n\r\nMarshal Freytag was covering the siege. (No. 2.)\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Orange was occupying an intermediate position at Menin.\r\n(No. 3.)\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Coburg, with the main army, was attacking Maubeuge, and\r\nwas guarding the space between that place and the Scheldt by strong\r\ndetachments. (No. 4.)\r\n\r\nClairfayt was covering the siege. (No. 5.)\r\n\r\nBenjouski was covering Charleroi and the Meuse, toward Thuin and\r\nCharleroi, the fortifications of which were being rebuilt. (No. 6.)\r\n\r\nAnother corps was covering the Ardennes and Luxembourg. (No. 7.)\r\n\r\nThe Prussians were besieging Landau. (No. 8.)\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Brunswick was covering the siege in the Vosges. (No. 9.)\r\n\r\nGeneral Wurmser was observing Strasbourg and the army of the Rhine. (No.\r\n10.)\r\n\r\nThe French, besides the detachments in front of each of the hostile\r\ncorps, had five principal masses in the camps of Lille, Douai, Guise,\r\nSarre Louis, and Strasbourg, (a, b, c, d, e.) A strong reserve, (g,)\r\ncomposed of the best troops drawn from the camps of the northern\r\nfrontier, was intended to be thrown upon all the points of the enemy's\r\nline in succession, assisted by the troops already in the neighborhood,\r\n(i, k, l, m.)\r\n\r\nThis reserve; assisted by the divisions of the camp of Cassel near\r\nDunkirk, commenced its operations by beating corps 1 and 2, under the\r\nDuke of York; then that of the Dutch, (No. 3,) at Menin; next that of\r\nClairfayt, (5,) before Maubeuge; finally, joining the army of the\r\nMoselle toward Sarre Louis, it beat the Duke of Brunswick in the Vosges,\r\nand, with the assistance of the army of the Rhine, (f,) drove Wurmser\r\nfrom the lines of Wissembourg.\r\n\r\nThe general principle was certainly well applied, and every similar\r\noperation will be praiseworthy. But, as the Austrians composed half the\r\nallied forces, and they had their lines of retreat from the points 4, 5,\r\nand 6 upon the Rhine, it is evident that if the French had collected\r\nthree of their large corps in order to move them against Benjouski at\r\nThuin, (No. 6,) and then fallen upon the Prince of Coburg's left by the\r\nCharleroi road, they would have thrown the imperial army upon the North\r\nSea, and would have obtained immense results.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Public Safety deemed it a matter of great importance\r\nthat Dunkirk should not be permitted to fell into the hands of the\r\nEnglish. Besides this, York's corps, encamped on the downs, might be\r\ncut off and thrown upon the sea; and the disposable French masses for\r\nthis object were at Douai, Lille, and Cassel: so that there were good\r\nreasons for commencing operations by attacking the English. The\r\nprincipal undertaking failed, because Houchard did not appreciate the\r\nstrategic advantage he had, and did not know how to act on the line of\r\nretreat of the Anglo-Hanoverian army. He was guillotined, by way of\r\npunishment, although he saved Dunkirk; yet he failed to cut off the\r\nEnglish as he might have done.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that this movement of the French reserve along the\r\nwhole front was the cause of five victories, neither of which had\r\ndecisive results, _because the attacks were made in front_, and because,\r\nwhen the cities were relieved, the allied armies not being cut through,\r\nand the French reserve moving on to the different points in succession,\r\nnone of the victories was pushed to its legitimate consequences. If the\r\nFrench had based themselves upon the five fortified towns on the Meuse,\r\nhad collected one hundred thousand men by bold and rapid marches, had\r\nfallen upon the center of those separated corps, had crushed Benjouski,\r\nassailed the Prince of Coburg in his rear, beaten him, and pursued him\r\nvigorously as Napoleon pursued at Ratisbon, and as he wished to do at\r\nLigny in 1815, the result would have been very different.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned this example, as it illustrates very well the two\r\nimportant points to be attended to in the strategic management of masses\r\nof troops; that is, their employment at different points in succession\r\nand at decisive points.[54]\r\n\r\nEvery educated military man will be impressed by the truths educed, and\r\nwill be convinced that the excellence of maneuvers will depend upon\r\ntheir conforming to the principle already insisted upon; that is to say,\r\nthe great part of the force must be moved against one wing or the\r\ncenter, according to the position of the enemy's masses. It is of\r\nimportance in battles to calculate distances with still greater\r\naccuracy; for the results of movements on the battle-field following\r\nthem more rapidly than in the case of strategic maneuvers, every\r\nprecaution must be taken to avoid exposing any part of the line to a\r\ndangerous attack from the enemy, especially if he is compactly drawn up.\r\nAdd to these things calmness during the action; the ability to choose\r\npositions for fighting battles in the manner styled the defensive with\r\n_offensive returns_, (Art. XXX.;) the simultaneous employment of the\r\nforces in striking the decisive blow, (see pages from 202 to 204;) the\r\nfaculty of arousing the soldiers and moving them forward at opportune\r\nmoments; and we have mentioned every thing which can assist, as far as\r\nthe general is concerned, in assuring victories, and every thing which\r\nwill constitute him a skillful tactician.\r\n\r\nIt is almost always easy to determine the decisive point of a field of\r\nbattle, but not so with the decisive moment; and it is precisely here\r\nthat genius and experience are every thing, and mere theory of little\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nIt is important, also, to consider attentively Article XLII., which\r\nexplains how a general may make a small number of suppositions as to\r\nwhat the enemy may or can do, and as to what course of conduct he shall\r\nhimself pursue upon those hypotheses. He may thus accustom himself to be\r\nprepared for any eventuality.\r\n\r\nI must also call attention to Article XXVIII., upon great detachments.\r\nThese are necessary evils, and, if not managed with great care, may\r\nprove ruinous to the best armies. The essential rules on this point are,\r\nto make as few detachments as possible, _to have them readily movable_,\r\nto draw them back to the main body as soon as practicable, and to give\r\nthem good instructions for avoiding disasters.\r\n\r\nI have nothing to say relative to the first two chapters on military\r\npolicy; for they are themselves nothing more than a brief summary of\r\nthis part of the art of war, which chiefly concerns statesmen, but\r\nshould be thoroughly understood by military men. I will, however,\r\ninvite special attention to Article XIV., relating to the command of\r\narmies or to the choice of generals-in-chief,--a subject worthy the most\r\nanxious care upon the part of a wise government; for upon it often\r\ndepends the safety of the nation.\r\n\r\nWe may be confident that a good strategist will make a good chief of\r\nstaff for an army; but for the command in chief is required a man of\r\ntried qualities, of high character and known energy. The united action\r\nof two such men as commander-in-chief and chief of staff, when a great\r\ncaptain of the first order cannot be had, may produce the most brilliant\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: The objective may be in some degree\r\n_political_,--especially in cases of wars of intervention in the affairs\r\nof another country; but it then really becomes geographical.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: The operations mentioned show the advantage of employing\r\nmasses at the decisive point, not because it was done in 1793, but\r\nbecause it was not done. If Napoleon had been in Carnot's place, he\r\nwould have fallen with all his force upon Charleroi, whence be would\r\nhave attacked the left of the Prince of Coburg and cut his line of\r\nretreat. Let any one compare the results of Carnot's half-skillful\r\noperations with the wise maneuvers of Saint-Bernard and Jena, and be\r\nconvinced.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE\r\n\r\nUPON\r\n\r\nTHE MEANS OF ACQUIRING A GOOD STRATEGIC COUP-D'OEIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study of the principles of strategy can produce no valuable\r\npractical results if we do nothing more than keep them in remembrance,\r\nnever trying to apply them, with map in hand, to hypothetical wars, or\r\nto the brilliant operations of great captains. By such exercises may be\r\nprocured a rapid and certain strategic _coup-d'oeil_,--the most valuable\r\ncharacteristic of a good general, without which he can never put in\r\npractice the finest theories in the world.\r\n\r\nWhen a military man who is a student of his art has become fully\r\nimpressed by the advantages procured by moving a strong mass against\r\nsuccessive fractions of the enemy's force, and particularly when he\r\nrecognizes the importance of constantly directing the main efforts upon\r\ndecisive points of the theater of operations, he will naturally desire\r\nto be able to perceive at a glance what are these decisive points. I\r\nhave already, in Chapter III., page 70, of the preceding Summary,\r\nindicated the simple means by which this knowledge may be obtained.\r\nThere is, in fact, one truth of remarkable simplicity which obtains in\r\nall the combinations of a methodical war. It is this:--_in every\r\nposition a general may occupy, he has only to decide whether to operate\r\nby the right, by the left, or by the front_.\r\n\r\nTo be convinced of the correctness of this assertion, let us first take\r\nthis general in his private office at the opening of the war. His first\r\ncare will be to choose that zone of operations which will give him the\r\ngreatest number of chances of success and be the least dangerous for him\r\nin case of reverse. As no theater of operations can have more than three\r\nzones, (that of the right, that of the center, and that of the left,)\r\nand as I have in Articles from XVII. to XXII. pointed out the manner of\r\nperceiving the advantages and dangers of these zones, the choice of a\r\nzone of operations will be a matter of no difficulty.\r\n\r\nWhen the general has finally chosen a zone within which to operate with\r\nthe principal portion of his forces, and when these forces shall be\r\nestablished in that zone, the army will have a front of operations\r\ntoward the hostile army, which will also have one. Now, these fronts of\r\noperations will each have its right, left, and center. It only remains,\r\nthen, for the general to decide upon which of these directions he can\r\ninjure the enemy most,--for this will always be the best, especially if\r\nhe can move upon it without endangering his own communications. I have\r\ndwelt upon this point also in the preceding Summary.\r\n\r\nFinally, when the two armies are in presence of each other upon the\r\nfield of battle where the decisive collision is to ensue, and are upon\r\nthe point of coming to blows, they will each have a right, left, and\r\ncenter; and it remains for the general to decide still between these\r\nthree directions of striking.\r\n\r\nLet us take, as an illustration of the truths I have mentioned, the\r\ntheater of operations, already referred to, between the Rhine and the\r\nNorth Sea. (See Fig. 39.)\r\n\r\nAlthough this theater presents, in one point of view, four geographical\r\nsections,--viz.: the space between the Rhine and the Moselle, that\r\nbetween the Moselle and the Meuse, that between the Meuse and the\r\nScheldt, and that between the last river and the sea,--it is\r\nnevertheless true that an army of which A A is the base and B B the\r\nfront of operations will have only three general directions to choose\r\nfrom; for the two spaces in the center will form a single central zone,\r\nas it will always have one on the right and another on the left.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.]\r\n\r\nThe army B B, wishing to take the offensive against the army CC, whose\r\nbase was the Rhine, would have three directions in which to operate. If\r\nit maneuvered by the extreme right, descending the Moselle, (toward D,)\r\nit would evidently threaten the enemy's line of retreat toward the\r\nRhine; but he, concentrating the mass of his forces toward Luxembourg,\r\nmight fall upon the left of the army D and compel it to change front and\r\nfight a battle with its rear toward the Rhine, causing its ruin if\r\nseriously defeated.\r\n\r\nIf, on the contrary, the army B wished to make its greatest effort upon\r\nthe left, (toward E,) in order to take advantage of the finely-fortified\r\ntowns of Lille and Valenciennes, it would be exposed to inconveniences\r\nstill more serious than before. For the army CC, concentrating in force\r\ntoward Audenarde, might fall on the right of B, and, outflanking this\r\nwing in the battle, might throw it upon the impassable country toward\r\nAntwerp between the Scheldt and the sea,--where there would remain but\r\ntwo things for it to do: either to surrender at discretion, or cut its\r\nway through the enemy at the sacrifice of half its numbers.\r\n\r\nIt appears evident, therefore, that the left zone would be the most\r\ndisadvantageous for army B, and the right zone would be inconvenient,\r\nalthough somewhat favorable in a certain point of view. The central zone\r\nremains to be examined. This is found to possess all desirable\r\nadvantages, because the army B might move the mass of its force toward\r\nCharleroi with a view of cutting through the immense front of operations\r\nof the enemy, might overwhelm his center, and drive the right back upon\r\nAntwerp and the Lower Scheldt, without seriously exposing its own\r\ncommunications.\r\n\r\nWhen the forces are chiefly concentrated upon the most favorable zone,\r\nthey should, of course, have that direction of movement toward the\r\nenemy's front of operations which is in harmony with the chief object in\r\nview. For example, if you shall have operated by your right against the\r\nenemy's left, with the intention of cutting off the greater portion of\r\nhis army from its base of the Rhine, you should certainly continue to\r\noperate in the same direction; for if you should make your greatest\r\neffort against the right of the enemy's front, while your plan was to\r\ngain an advantage over his left, your operations could not result as you\r\nanticipated, no matter how well they might be executed. If, on the\r\ncontrary, you had decided to take the left zone, with the intention of\r\ncrowding the enemy back upon the sea, you ought constantly to maneuver\r\nby your right in order to accomplish your object; for if you maneuvered\r\nby the left, yourself and not the enemy would be the party thrown back\r\nupon the sea in case of a reverse.\r\n\r\nApplying these ideas to the theaters of the campaigns of Marengo, Ulm,\r\nand Jena, we find the same three zones, with this difference, that in\r\nthose campaigns the central direction was not the best. In 1800, the\r\ndirection of the left led straight to the left bank of the Po, on the\r\nline of retreat of Mélas; in 1805, the left zone was the one which led\r\nby the way of Donauwerth to the extreme right, and the line of retreat\r\nof Mack; in 1806, however, Napoleon could reach the Prussian line of\r\nretreat by the right zone, filing off from Bamberg toward Gera.\r\n\r\nIn 1800, Napoleon had to choose between a line of operations on the\r\nright, leading to the sea-shore toward Nice and Savona, that of the\r\ncenter, leading by Mont-Cenis toward Turin, and that of the left,\r\nleading to the line of communications of Mélas, by way of Saint-Bernard\r\nor the Simplon. The first two directions had nothing in their favor, and\r\nthe right might have been very dangerous,--as, in fact, it proved to\r\nMassena, who was forced back to Genoa and there besieged. The decisive\r\ndirection was evidently that by the left.\r\n\r\nI have said enough to explain my ideas on this point.\r\n\r\nThe subject of battles is somewhat more complicated; for in the\r\narrangements for these there are both strategical and tactical\r\nconsiderations to be taken into account and harmonized. A position for\r\nbattle, being necessarily connected with the line of retreat and the\r\nbase of operations, must have a well-defined strategic direction; but\r\nthis direction must also depend somewhat upon the character of the\r\nground and the stations of the troops of both parties to the engagement:\r\nthese are tactical considerations. Although an army usually takes such a\r\nposition for a battle as will keep its line of retreat behind it,\r\nsometimes it is obliged to assume a position parallel to this line. In\r\nsuch a case it is evident that if you fall with overwhelming force upon\r\nthe wing nearest the line of retreat, the enemy may be cut off or\r\ndestroyed, or, at least, have no other chance of escape than in forcing\r\nhis way through your line.\r\n\r\nI will here mention as illustrations the celebrated battle of Leuthen\r\nin 1757, of which I have given an account in the history of Frederick's\r\nwars, and the famous days of Krasnoi, in the retreat from Moscow in\r\n1812.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.]\r\n\r\nThe annexed figure (40) explains the combination at Krasnoi. The line A\r\nA is Napoleon's line of retreat toward C. He took the position B B to\r\ncover his line. It is evident that the principal mass of Koutousoff's\r\narmy D D should have moved to E E in order to fall on the right of the\r\nFrench, whose army would have been certainly destroyed if it had been\r\nanticipated at C; for everybody knows in what a state it was while thus\r\nfifteen hundred miles from its true base.\r\n\r\nThere was the same combination at Jemmapes, where Dumouriez, by\r\noutflanking the Austrian left, instead of attacking their right, would\r\nhave entirely cut them off from the Rhine.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Leuthen Frederick overwhelmed the Austrian left, which\r\nwas in the direction of their line of retreat; and for this reason the\r\nright wing was obliged to take refuge in Breslau, where it capitulated a\r\nfew days later.\r\n\r\nIn such cases there is no cause for hesitation. The decisive point is\r\nthat wing of the enemy which is nearest his line of retreat, and this\r\nline you must seize while protecting your own.\r\n\r\nWhen an enemy has one or two lines of retreat perpendicular to and\r\nbehind his position of battle, it will generally be best to attack the\r\ncenter, or that wing where the obstacles of the ground shall be the\r\nleast favorable for the defense; for in such a case the first\r\nconsideration is to gain the battle, without having in view the total\r\ndestruction of the enemy. That depends upon the relative numerical\r\nstrength, the _morale_ of the two armies, and other circumstances, with\r\nreference to which no fixed rules can be laid down.\r\n\r\nFinally, it happens sometimes that an army succeeds in seizing the\r\nenemy's line of retreat before fighting a battle, as Napoleon did at\r\nMarengo, Ulm, and Jena. The decisive point having in such case been\r\nsecured by skillful marches before fighting, it only remains to prevent\r\nthe enemy from forcing his way through your line. You can do nothing\r\nbetter than fight a parallel battle, as there is no reason for\r\nmaneuvering against one wing more than the other. But for the enemy who\r\nis thus cut off the case is very different. He should certainly strike\r\nmost heavily in the direction of that wing where he can hope most\r\nspeedily to regain his proper line of retreat; and if he throws the mass\r\nof his forces there, he may save at least a large portion of them. All\r\nthat he has to do is to determine whether this decisive effort shall be\r\ntoward the right or the left.\r\n\r\nIt is proper for me to remark that the passage of a great river in the\r\npresence of a hostile army is sometimes an exceptional case to which the\r\ngeneral rules will not apply. In these operations, which are of an\r\nexceedingly delicate character, the essential thing is to keep the\r\nbridges safe. If, after effecting the passage, a general should throw\r\nthe mass of his forces toward the right or the left with a view of\r\ntaking possession of some decisive point, or of driving his enemy back\r\nupon the river, whilst the latter was collecting all his forces in\r\nanother direction to seize the bridges, the former army might be in a\r\nvery critical condition in case of a reverse befalling it. The battle of\r\nWagram is an excellent example in point,--as good, indeed, as could be\r\ndesired. I have treated this subject in Article XXXVII., (pages 224 and\r\nfollowing.)\r\n\r\nA military man who clearly perceives the importance of the truths that\r\nhave been stated will succeed in acquiring a rapid and accurate\r\n_coup-d'oeil_. It will be admitted, moreover, that a general who\r\nestimates them at their true value, and accustoms himself to their use,\r\neither in reading military history, or in hypothetical cases on maps,\r\nwill seldom be in doubt, in real campaigns, what he ought to do; and\r\neven when his enemy attempts sudden and unexpected movements, he will\r\nalways be ready with suitable measures for counteracting them, by\r\nconstantly bearing in mind the few simple fundamental principles which\r\nshould regulate all the operations of war.\r\n\r\nHeaven forbid that I should pretend to lessen the dignity of the sublime\r\nart of war by reducing it to such simple elements! I appreciate\r\nthoroughly the difference between the directing principles of\r\ncombinations arranged in the quiet of the closet, and that special\r\ntalent which is indispensable to the individual who has, amidst the\r\nnoise and confusion of battle, to keep a hundred thousand men\r\nco-operating toward the attainment of one single object. I know well\r\nwhat should be the character and talents of the general who has to make\r\nsuch masses move as one man, to engage them at the proper point\r\nsimultaneously and at the proper moment, to keep them supplied with\r\narms, provisions, clothing, and munitions. Still, although this special\r\ntalent, to which I have referred, is indispensable, it must be granted\r\nthat the ability to give wise direction to masses upon the best\r\nstrategic points of a theater of operations is the most sublime\r\ncharacteristic of a great captain. How many brave armies, under the\r\ncommand of leaders who were also brave and possessed executive ability,\r\nhave lost not only battles, but even empires, because they were moved\r\nimprudently in one direction when they should have gone in the other!\r\nNumerous examples might be mentioned; but I will refer only to Ligny,\r\nWaterloo, Bautzen, Dennewitz, Leuthen.\r\n\r\nI will say no more; for I could only repeat what has already been said.\r\nTo relieve myself in advance of the blame which will be ascribed to me\r\nfor attaching too much importance to the application of the few maxims\r\nlaid down in my writings, I will repeat what I was the first to\r\nannounce:--\"_that war is not an exact science, but a drama full of\r\npassion_; that the moral qualities, the talents, the executive foresight\r\nand ability, the greatness of character, of the leaders, and the\r\nimpulses, sympathies, and passions of the masses, have a great influence\r\nupon it.\" I may be permitted also, after having written the detailed\r\nhistory of thirty campaigns and assisted in person in twelve of the most\r\ncelebrated of them, to declare that I have not found a single case where\r\nthese principles, correctly applied, did not lead to success.\r\n\r\nAs to the special executive ability and the well-balanced penetrating\r\nmind which distinguish the practical man from the one who knows only\r\nwhat others teach him, I confess that no book can introduce those things\r\ninto a head where the germ does not previously exist by nature. I have\r\nseen many generals--marshals, even--attain a certain degree of\r\nreputation by talking largely of principles which they conceived\r\nincorrectly in theory and could not apply at all. I have seen these men\r\nintrusted with the supreme command of armies, and make the most\r\nextravagant plans, because they were totally deficient in good judgment\r\nand were filled with inordinate self-conceit. My works are not intended\r\nfor such misguided persons as these, but my desire has been to\r\nfacilitate the study of the art of war for careful, inquiring minds, by\r\npointing out directing principles. Taking this view, I claim credit for\r\nhaving rendered valuable service to those officers who are really\r\ndesirous of gaining distinction in the profession of arms.\r\n\r\nFinally, I will conclude this short summary with one last truth:--\r\n\r\n\"The first of all the requisites for a man's success as a leader is,\r\nthat he be perfectly brave. When a general is animated by a truly\r\nmartial spirit and can communicate it to his soldiers, he may commit\r\nfaults, but he will gain victories and secure deserved laurels.\"\r\n\r\n[Blank Page]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND APPENDIX\r\n\r\nTO THE\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE ART OF WAR.\r\n\r\nON THE FORMATION OF TROOPS FOR BATTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHappening to be in Paris, near the end of 1851, a distinguished person\r\ndid me the honor to ask my opinion as to whether recent improvements in\r\nfire-arms would cause any great modifications in the manner of making\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nI replied that they would probably have an influence upon the details of\r\ntactics, but that, in great strategic operations and the grand\r\ncombinations of battles, victory would, now as ever, result from the\r\napplication of the principles which had led to the success of great\r\ngenerals in all ages,--of Alexander and Cæsar as well as of Frederick\r\nand Napoleon. My illustrious interlocutor seemed to be completely of my\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nThe heroic events which have recently occurred near Sebastopol have not\r\nproduced the slightest change in my opinion. This gigantic contest\r\nbetween two vast intrenched camps, occupied by entire armies and\r\nmounting two thousand guns of the largest caliber, is an event without\r\nprecedent, which will have no equal in the future; for the circumstances\r\nwhich produced it cannot occur again.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this contest of cannon with ramparts, bearing no resemblance\r\nto regular pitched battles fought in the center of a continent, cannot\r\ninfluence in any respect the great combinations of war, nor even the\r\ntactics of battles.\r\n\r\nThe bloody battles of the Alma and Inkermann, by giving evidence of the\r\nmurderous effect of the new fire-arms, naturally led me to investigate\r\nthe changes which it might be necessary to make on this account in the\r\ntactics for infantry.\r\n\r\nI shall endeavor to fulfill this task in a few words, in order to\r\ncomplete what was published on this point twenty years ago in the\r\nSummary of the Art of War.\r\n\r\nThe important question of the influence of musketry-fire in battles is\r\nnot new: it dates from the reign of Frederick the Great, and\r\nparticularly from the battle of Mollwitz, which he gained (it was said)\r\nbecause his infantry-soldiers, by the use of cylindrical rammers in\r\nloading their muskets, were able to fire three shots per minute more\r\nthan their enemies.[55] The discussion which arose at this epoch between\r\nthe partisans of the shallow and deep orders of formation for troops is\r\nknown to all military students.\r\n\r\nThe system of deployed lines in three ranks was adopted for the\r\ninfantry; the cavalry, formed in two ranks, and in the order of battle,\r\nwas deployed upon the wings, or a part was held in reserve.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated regulation for maneuvers of 1791 fixed the deployed as\r\nthe only order for battle: it seemed to admit the use of\r\nbattalion-columns doubled on the center only in partial combats,--such\r\nas an attack upon an isolated post, a village, a forest, or small\r\nintrenchments.[56]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe insufficient instruction in maneuvers of the troops of the Republic\r\nforced the generals, who were poor tacticians, to employ in battle the\r\nsystem of columns supported by numerous skirmishers. Besides this, the\r\nnature of the countries which formed the theaters of operations--the\r\nVosges, Alps, Pyrenees, and the difficult country of La Vendée--rendered\r\nthis the only appropriate system. How would it have been possible to\r\nattack the camps of Saorgio, Figueras, and Mont-Cenis with deployed\r\nregiments?\r\n\r\nIn Napoleon's time, the French generally used the system of columns, as\r\nthey were nearly always the assailants.\r\n\r\nIn 1807, I published, at Glogau in Silesia, a small pamphlet with the\r\ntitle of \"Summary of the General Principles of the Art of War,\" in which\r\nI proposed to admit for the attack the system of lines formed of columns\r\nof battalions by divisions of two companies; in other words, to march to\r\nthe attack in lines of battalions closed in mass or at half-distance,\r\npreceded by numerous skirmishers, and the columns being separated by\r\nintervals that may vary between that necessary for the deployment of a\r\nbattalion and the minimum of the front of one column.\r\n\r\nWhat I had recently seen in the campaigns of Ulm, Austerlitz, Jena, and\r\nEylau had convinced me of the difficulty, if not the impossibility, of\r\nmarching an army in deployed lines in either two or three ranks, to\r\nattack an enemy in position. It was this conviction which led me to\r\npublish the pamphlet above referred to. This work attracted some\r\nattention, not only on account of the treatise on strategy, but also on\r\naccount of what was said on tactics.\r\n\r\nThe successes gained by Wellington in Spain and at Waterloo with troops\r\ndeployed in lines of two ranks were generally attributed to the\r\nmurderous effect of the infantry-fire, and created doubt in some minds\r\nas to the propriety of the use of small columns; but it was not till\r\nafter 1815 that the controversies on the best formation for battle wore\r\nrenewed by the appearance of a pamphlet by the Marquis of Chambray.\r\n\r\nIn these discussions, I remarked the fatal tendency of the clearest\r\nminds to reduce every system of war to absolute forms, and to cast in\r\nthe same mold all the tactical combinations a general may arrange,\r\nwithout taking into consideration localities, moral circumstances,\r\nnational characteristics, or the abilities of the commanders. I had\r\nproposed to use lines of small columns, especially in the attack: I\r\nnever intended to make it an exclusive system, particularly for the\r\ndefense.\r\n\r\nI had two opportunities of being convinced that this formation was\r\napproved of by the greatest generals of our times. The first was at the\r\nCongress of Vienna, in the latter part of 1814: the Archduke Charles\r\nobserved \"that he was under great obligations for the summary I had\r\npublished in 1807, which General Walmoden had brought to him in 1808\r\nfrom Silesia.\" At the beginning of the war of 1809, the prince had not\r\nthought it possible to apply the formation which I had proposed; but at\r\nthe battle of Essling the contracted space of the field induced him to\r\nform a part of his army in columns by battalions, (the landwehr\r\nparticularly,) and they resisted admirably the furious charges of the\r\ncuirassiers of General d'Espagne, which, in the opinion of the archduke,\r\nthey could not have done if they had been deployed.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Wagram, the greater part of the Austrian line was\r\nformed in the same way as at Essling, and after two days of terrible\r\nfighting the archduke abandoned the field of battle, not because his\r\narmy was badly beaten, but because his left was outflanked and thrown\r\nback so as to endanger his line of retreat on Hungary. The prince was\r\nsatisfied that the firm bearing of his troops was in part due to this\r\nmixture of small columns with deployed battalions.\r\n\r\nThe second witness is Wellington; although his evidence is, apparently,\r\nnot so conclusive. Having been presented to him at the Congress of\r\nVerona in 1823, I had occasion to speak to him on the subject of the\r\ncontroversies to which his system of formation for battle (a system to\r\nwhich a great part of his success had been attributed) had given rise.\r\nHe remarked that he was convinced the manner of the attack of the French\r\nupon him, in columns more or less deep, was very dangerous against a\r\nsolid, well-armed infantry having confidence in its fire and well\r\nsupported by artillery and cavalry. I observed to the duke that these\r\ndeep columns were very different from the small columns which I\r\nproposed,--a formation which insures in the attack steadiness, force,\r\nand mobility, while deep masses afford no greater mobility and force\r\nthan a deployed line, and are very much more exposed to the ravages of\r\nartillery.\r\n\r\nI asked the illustrious general if at Waterloo he had not formed the\r\nHanoverian, Brunswick, and Belgian troops in columns by battalions. He\r\nanswered, \"Yes; because I could not depend upon them so well as upon the\r\nEnglish.\" I replied that this admission proved that he thought a line\r\nformed of columns by battalions was more firm than long deployed lines.\r\nHe replied, \"They are certainly good, also; but their use always depends\r\nupon the localities and the spirit of the troops. A general cannot act\r\nin the same manner under all circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nTo this illustrious evidence I might add that Napoleon himself, in the\r\ncampaign of 1813, prescribed for the attack the formation of the\r\ninfantry in columns by divisions of two companies in two ranks, as the\r\nmost suitable,--which was identically what I had proposed in 1807.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington also admitted that the French columns at\r\nWaterloo, particularly those of their right wing, were not small columns\r\nof battalions, but enormous masses, much more unwieldy and much deeper.\r\n\r\nIf we can believe the Prussian accounts and plans of the battle, it\r\nwould seem that Ney's four divisions were formed in but four columns, at\r\nleast in their march to the attack of La Haye Sainte and the line\r\nextending from this farm to the Papelotte. I was not present; but\r\nseveral officers have assured me that at one time the troops were formed\r\nin columns by divisions of two brigades each, the battalions being\r\ndeployed behind each other at six paces' interval.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance demonstrates how much is wanting in the military terms\r\nof the French. We give the same name of _division_ to masses of four\r\nregiments and to fractions of a battalion of two companies each,--which\r\nis absurd. Let us suppose, for example, that Napoleon had directed on\r\nthe 18th of June, 1815, the formation of the line in columns by\r\ndivisions and by battalions, intending that the regulation of 1813\r\nshould be followed. His lieutenants might naturally have understood it\r\nvery differently, and, according to their interpretation of the order,\r\nwould have executed one of the following formations:--\r\n\r\n1. Either the four divisions of the right wing would have been formed in\r\nfour large masses, each one of eight or twelve battalions, (according to\r\nthe strength of the regiments,) as is indicated in this figure for eight\r\nbattalions.[57]\r\n\r\n2. Or each division would have been formed in eight or twelve columns of\r\nbattalions by divisions of two platoons or companies, according to the\r\nsystem I have proposed, as in this figure, viz.:--\r\n\r\nI do not mean to assert positively that this confusion of words led to\r\nthe deep masses at Waterloo; but it might have done so; and it is\r\nimportant that in every language there should be two different terms to\r\nexpress two such different things as a _division_ of twelve battalions\r\nand a _division_ of a quarter of a battalion.\r\n\r\nStruck with what precedes, I thought it proper to modify my Summary\r\nalready referred to, which was too concise, and in my revision of it I\r\ndevoted a chapter to the discussion of the advantages and disadvantages\r\nof the different formations for battle. I also added some considerations\r\nrelative to a mixed system used at Eylau by General Benningsen, which\r\nconsisted in forming a regiment of three battalions by deploying the\r\ncentral one, the other two being in column on the wings.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter these discussions, I drew the conclusions:--\r\n\r\n1. That Wellington's system was certainly good for the defensive.\r\n\r\n2. That the system of Benningsen might, according to circumstances, be\r\nas good for the offensive as for the defensive, since it was\r\nsuccessfully used by Napoleon at the passage of the Tagliamento.\r\n\r\n3. That the most skillful tactician would experience great difficulty in\r\nmarching forty or fifty deployed battalions in two or three ranks over\r\nan interval of twelve or fifteen hundred yards, preserving sufficient\r\norder to attack an enemy in position with any chance of success, the\r\nfront all the while being played upon by artillery and musketry.\r\n\r\nI have never seen any thing of the kind in my experience. I regard it as\r\nimpossible, and am convinced that such a line could not advance to the\r\nattack in sufficiently good order to have the force necessary for\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nNapoleon was in the habit of addressing his marshals in these\r\nterms:--\"Take your troops up in good order, and make a vigorous assault\r\nupon the enemy.\" I ask, what means is there of carrying up to the\r\nassault of an enemy forty or fifty deployed battalions as a whole in\r\ngood order? They will reach the enemy in detachments disconnected from\r\neach other, and the commander cannot exercise any control over the mass\r\nas a whole.\r\n\r\nI saw nothing of this kind either at Ulm, Jena, Eylau, Bautzen, Dresden,\r\nCulm, or Leipsic; neither did it occur at Austerlitz, Friedland,\r\nKatzbach, or Dennewitz.\r\n\r\nI am not aware that Wellington, in any of his battles, ever marched in\r\ndeployed lines to the attack of an enemy in position. He generally\r\nawaited the attack. At Vittoria and Toulouse he gained the victory by\r\nmaneuvers against the flanks; and at Toulouse Soult's right wing was\r\nbeaten while descending the heights to attack. Even at Waterloo, what\r\nfate would have befallen the English army if, leaving the plateau of\r\nMont Saint-Jean, it had marched in deployed order to attack Napoleon in\r\nposition on the heights of La Belle Alliance?\r\n\r\nI will be pardoned for these recapitulations, as they seem to be\r\nnecessary to the solution of a question which has arisen since my\r\nSummary of the Art of War was written.\r\n\r\nSome German generals, recognizing fully the advantages derived in 1813\r\nfrom the system of columns of battalions, have endeavored to add to its\r\nvalue by dividing up the columns and increasing their number, so as to\r\nmake them more shallow and to facilitate their deployment. With this\r\nview, they propose, instead of forming four divisions or companies one\r\nbehind the other, to place them beside each other, not deployed, but in\r\nsmall columns. That is, if the battalion consists of four companies of\r\ntwo hundred and forty men each, each company is to be divided into four\r\nsections of sixty each: one of these sections will be dispersed as\r\nskirmishers, and the other three, in two ranks, will form a small\r\ncolumn; so that the battalion, instead of forming one column, will form\r\nfour, and the regiment of three battalions will form twelve small\r\ncolumns instead of three--\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n3d Battalion. 2d Battalion. 1st Battalion. --- --- --- --- --- --- ---\r\n--- --- --- --- ------ --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ------\r\n--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ------ --- --- --- --- --- ---\r\n--- --- --- --- ---]\r\n\r\nIt is certain that it would be easier to march such a line against the\r\nenemy than if deployed; but these diminutive columns of sixty\r\nskirmishers and one hundred and eighty men in the ranks would never\r\npresent the same order and solidity as a single column of a battalion.\r\nStill as the system has some advantages, it deserves a trial; and,\r\nindeed, it has already been practiced in Prussia and Austria.\r\n\r\nThe same formation applies equally to battalions of six or eight\r\ncompanies. In this case the battalion would not be formed by companies,\r\nbut by divisions of two companies,--that is, in three or four columns,\r\naccording to the number of companies.\r\n\r\nTwo serious inconveniences appear to me to attach to each of these\r\nformations. If vigorously charged by cavalry, these small subdivisions\r\nwould be in great danger; and even in attacking the enemy's line, if\r\ndriven back and pursued, disorder would be more likely to occur than in\r\nthe columns of battalions. Still, either of them may be employed,\r\naccording to circumstances, localities, and the _morale_ of the troops.\r\nExperience alone can assign to each its proper value. I am not aware\r\nwhether the Austrians applied these columns of companies at Custozza and\r\nNovara, or whether these maneuvers have only been practiced in their\r\ncamps of instruction.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, there is another not less important question to be\r\nconsidered:--\r\n\r\n\"Will the adoption of the rifled small-arms and improved balls bring\r\nabout any important changes in the formation for battle and the now\r\nrecognized principles of tactics?\"\r\n\r\nIf these arms aided the allies at the Alma and Inkermann, it was because\r\nthe Russians were not provided with them; and it must not be forgotten\r\nthat in a year or two all armies will alike be furnished with them, so\r\nthat in future the advantage will not be confined to one side.\r\n\r\nWhat change will it make in tactics?\r\n\r\nWill whole armies be deployed as skirmishers, or will it not still be\r\nnecessary to preserve either the formation of lines deployed in two or\r\nthree ranks, or lines of battalions in columns?\r\n\r\nWill battles become mere duels with the rifle, where the parties will\r\nfire upon each other, without maneuvering, until one or the other shall\r\nretreat or be destroyed?\r\n\r\nWhat military man will reply in the affirmative?\r\n\r\nIt follows, therefore, that, to decide battles, maneuvers are necessary,\r\nand victory will fall to the general who maneuvers most skillfully; and\r\nhe cannot maneuver except with deployed lines or lines of columns of\r\nbattalions, either whole or subdivided into columns of one or two\r\ncompanies. To attempt to prescribe by regulation under what\r\ncircumstances either of these systems is to be applied would be absurd.\r\n\r\nIf a general and an army can be found such that he can march upon the\r\nenemy in a deployed line of forty or fifty battalions, then let the\r\nshallow order be adopted, and the formation in columns be confined to\r\nthe attack of isolated posts; but I freely confess that I would never\r\naccept the command of an army under this condition. The only point for a\r\nregulation for the formation for battle is to forbid the use of very\r\ndeep columns, because they are heavy, and difficult to move and to keep\r\nin order. Besides, they are so much exposed to artillery that their\r\ndestruction seems inevitable, and their great depth does not increase in\r\nany respect their chances of success.\r\n\r\nIf the organization of an army were left to me, I would adopt for\r\ninfantry the formation in two ranks, and a regimental organization\r\naccording with the formation for battle. I would then make each regiment\r\nof infantry to consist of three battalions and a depot. Each battalion\r\nshould consist of six companies, so that when in column by division the\r\ndepth would be three divisions or six ranks.\r\n\r\nThis formation seems most reasonable, whether it is desired to form the\r\nbattalion in columns of attack by divisions on the center of each\r\nbattalion, or on any other division.\r\n\r\nThe columns of attack, since the depth is only six ranks, would not be\r\nso much exposed to the fire of artillery, but would still have the\r\nmobility necessary to take the troops up in good order and launch them\r\nupon the enemy with great force. The deployment of these small columns\r\ncould be executed with great ease and promptitude; and for the forming\r\nof a square a column of three divisions in depth would be preferable in\r\nseveral respects to one of four or six divisions.\r\n\r\nIn the Russian service each battalion consists of four companies of two\r\nhundred and fifty men each; each company being as strong as a division\r\nin the French organization. The maneuver of double column on the center\r\nis not practicable, since the center is here merely an interval\r\nseparating the second and third companies. Hence the column must be\r\nsimple, not on the center, but on one of the four companies. Something\r\nanalogous to the double column on the center would be attained by\r\nforming the first and fourth companies behind the second and third\r\nrespectively; but then the formation would be in two lines rather than\r\nin column; and this is the reason why I would prefer the organization of\r\nthe battalion in six companies or three divisions.\r\n\r\nBy dividing each of the four companies into two platoons, making eight\r\nin all, the formation of _double column on the center_ might be made on\r\nthe fourth and fifth platoons as the leading division; but then each\r\ndivision would be composed of two platoons belonging to different\r\ncompanies, so that each captain would have half of the men of his\r\ncompany under the command of another officer, and half of his own\r\ndivision would be made up of another company.\r\n\r\nSuch an arrangement in the attack would be very inconvenient; for, as\r\nthe captain is the real commander, father, and judge of the men of his\r\nown company, he can always obtain more from them in the way of duty than\r\nany stranger. In addition, if the double column should meet with a\r\ndecided repulse, and it should be necessary to reform it in line, it\r\nwould be difficult to prevent disorder, the platoons being obliged to\r\nrun from one side to the other to find their companies. In the French\r\nsystem, where each battalion consists of eight companies, forming as\r\nmany platoons at drill, this objection does not exist, since each\r\ncompany is conducted by its own captain. It is true that there will be\r\ntwo captains of companies in each division; but this will be rather an\r\nadvantage than the reverse, since there will be a rivalry and emulation\r\nbetween the two captains and their men, which will lead to greater\r\ndisplay of bravery: besides, if necessary, the senior captain is there,\r\nto command the division as a whole.\r\n\r\nIt is time to leave these secondary details and return to the important\r\nquestion at issue.\r\n\r\nSince I have alluded to the system adopted by Wellington, it is proper\r\nto explain it so that it can be estimated at its true value in the light\r\nof historical events.\r\n\r\nIn Spain and Portugal, particularly, Wellington had under his command a\r\nmass of troops of the country, in which he placed but little confidence\r\nin regular formation in a pitched battle, on account of their want of\r\ninstruction and discipline, but which were animated by a lively hatred\r\nof the French and formed bodies of skirmishers useful in harassing the\r\nenemy. Having learned by experience the effects of the fury and\r\nimpetuosity of the French columns when led by such men as Massena and\r\nNey, Wellington decided upon wise means of weakening this impetuosity\r\nand afterward securing a triumph over it. He chose positions difficult\r\nto approach, and covered all their avenues by swarms of Spanish and\r\nPortuguese riflemen, who were skilled in taking advantage of the\r\ninequalities of the ground; he placed a part of his artillery on the\r\ntactical crest of his position, and a part more to the rear, and riddled\r\nthe advancing columns with a murderous artillery and musketry fire,\r\nwhile his excellent English infantry, sheltered from the fire, were\r\nposted a hundred paces in rear of the crest, to await the arrival of\r\nthese columns; and when the latter appeared on the summit, wearied, out\r\nof breath, decimated in numbers, they were received with a general\r\ndischarge of artillery and musketry and immediately charged by the\r\ninfantry with the bayonet.\r\n\r\nThis system, which was perfectly rational and particularly applicable to\r\nSpain and Portugal, since he had there great numbers of this kind of\r\ntroops and there was a great deal of rough ground upon which they could\r\nbe useful as marksmen, needed some modifications to make it applicable\r\nto Belgium. At Waterloo the duke took his position on a plateau with a\r\ngentle slope like a glacis, where his artillery had a magnificent field\r\nof fire, and where it produced a terrible effect: both flanks of this\r\nplateau were well protected. Wellington, from the crest of the plateau,\r\ncould discover the slightest movement in the French army, while his own\r\nwere hidden; but, nevertheless, his system would not have prevented his\r\nlosing the battle if a number of other circumstances had not come to his\r\naid.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows more or less correctly the events of this terrible\r\nbattle, which I have elsewhere impartially described. I demonstrated\r\nthat its result was due neither to the musketry-fire nor to the use of\r\ndeployed lines by the English, but to the following accidental causes,\r\nviz.:--\r\n\r\n1. To the mud, which rendered the progress of the French in the attack\r\npainful and slow, and caused their first attacks to be less effective,\r\nand prevented their being properly sustained by the artillery.\r\n\r\n2. To the original formation of very deep columns on the part of the\r\nFrench, principally on the right wing.\r\n\r\n3. To the want of unity in the employment of the three arms: the\r\ninfantry and cavalry made a number of charges alternating with each\r\nother, but they were in no case simultaneous.\r\n\r\n4. Finally and chiefly, to the unexpected arrival of the whole Prussian\r\narmy at the decisive moment on the right flank, if not the rear, of the\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nEvery experienced military man will agree that, in spite of the mud and\r\nthe firmness of the English infantry, if the mass of the French infantry\r\nhad been thrown on the English in columns of battalions immediately\r\nafter the great charge of cavalry, the combined army would have been\r\nbroken and forced back on Antwerp. Independently of this, if the\r\nPrussians had not arrived, the English would have been compelled to\r\nretreat; and I maintain that this battle cannot justly be cited as proof\r\nof the superiority of musketry-fire over well-directed attacks in\r\ncolumns.\r\n\r\nFrom all these discussions we may draw the following conclusions,\r\nviz.:--\r\n\r\n1. That the improvements in fire-arms will not introduce any important\r\nchange in the manner of taking troops into battle, but that it would be\r\nuseful to introduce into the tactics of infantry the formation of\r\ncolumns by companies, and to have a numerous body of good riflemen or\r\nskirmishers, and to exercise the troops considerably in firing. Those\r\narmies which have whole regiments of light infantry may distribute them\r\nthrough the different brigades; but it would be preferable to detail\r\nsharp-shooters alternately in each company as they are needed, which\r\nwould be practicable when the troops are accustomed to firing: by this\r\nplan the light-infantry regiments could be employed in the line with the\r\nothers; and should the number of sharp-shooters taken from the companies\r\nbe at any time insufficient, they could be reinforced by a battalion of\r\nlight infantry to each division.\r\n\r\n2. That if Wellington's system of deployed lines and musketry-fire be\r\nexcellent for the defense, it would be difficult ever to employ it in an\r\nattack upon an enemy in position.\r\n\r\n3. That, in spite of the improvements of fire-arms, two armies in a\r\nbattle will not pass the day in firing at each other from a distance: it\r\nwill always be necessary for one of them to advance to the attack of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n4. That, as this advance is necessary, success will depend, as formerly,\r\nupon the most skillful maneuvering according to the principles of grand\r\ntactics, which consist in this, viz.: in knowing how to direct the great\r\nmass of the troops at the proper moment upon the decisive point of the\r\nbattle-field, and in employing for this purpose the simultaneous action\r\nof the three arms.\r\n\r\n5. That it would be difficult to add much to what has been said on this\r\nsubject in Chapters IV. and V.; and that it would be unreasonable to\r\ndefine by regulation an absolute system of formation for battle.\r\n\r\n6. That victory may with much certainty be expected by the party taking\r\nthe offensive when the general in command possesses the talent of taking\r\nhis troops into action in good order and of boldly attacking the enemy,\r\nadopting the system of formation best adapted to the ground, to the\r\nspirit and quality of his troops, and to his own character.\r\n\r\nFinally, I will terminate this article with the following remark: That\r\nwar, far from being an exact science, is a terrible and impassioned\r\ndrama, regulated, it is true, by three or four general principles, but\r\nalso dependent for its results upon a number of moral and physical\r\ncomplications.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: It is probable that Baron Jomini here refers to iron,\r\ninstead of cylindrical, ramrods. Before 1730, all European troops used\r\nwooden ramrods; and the credit of the invention of iron ones is\r\nattributed by some to the Prince of Anhalt, and by others to Prince\r\nLeopold of Dessau. The Prussians were the first to adopt the iron\r\nramrod, and at the date of the battle of Mollwitz (1741) it had not been\r\nintroduced into the Austrian service.\r\n\r\nFrederick did not adopt the cylindrical ramrod till 1777, thirty-six\r\nyears after the battle of Mollwitz. The advantage of the cylindrical\r\nramrod consisted in this,--that the soldier in loading saved the time\r\nnecessary to turn the ramrod; but obviously this small economy of time\r\ncould never have enabled him to load three times while the enemy loaded\r\nonce,--all other things being equal.--Translators.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: Columns by battalions closed in mass seemed only to be\r\nintended to use in long columns on the march, to keep them closed, in\r\norder to facilitate their deployment.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: We suppose each regiment to consist of two battalions: if\r\nthere should be three in each regiment, the deep column would then\r\nconsist of twelve lines of either twenty-four or thirty-six ranks, while\r\nin the next figure there would be twelve battalions on the line instead\r\nof eight, the depth not being increased.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSKETCH OF THE PRINCIPAL MARITIME EXPEDITIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have thought it proper to give here an account of the principal\r\nmaritime expeditions, to be taken in connection with maxims on descents.\r\n\r\nThe naval forces of Egypt, Phoenicia, and Rhodes are the earliest\r\nmentioned in history, and of them the account is confused. The Persians\r\nconquered these nations, as well as Asia Minor, and became the most\r\nformidable power on both land and sea.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the Carthaginians, who were masters of the coast of\r\nMauritania, being invited by the inhabitants of Cadiz, passed the\r\nstraits, colonized Boetica and took possession of the Balearic Isles and\r\nSardinia, and finally made a descent on Sicily.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks contended against the Persians with a success that could not\r\nhave been expected,--although no country was ever more favorably\r\nsituated for a naval power than Greece, with her fifty islands and her\r\ngreat extent of coast.\r\n\r\nThe merchant marine of Athens produced her prosperity, and gave her the\r\nnaval power to which Greece was indebted for her independence. Her\r\nfleets, united with those of the islands, were, under Themistocles, the\r\nterror of the Persians and the rulers of the East. They never made grand\r\ndescents, because their land-forces were not in proportion to their\r\nnaval strength. Had Greece been a united government instead of a\r\nconfederation of republics, and had the navies of Athens, Syracuse,\r\nCorinth, and Sparta been combined instead of fighting among each other,\r\nit is probable that the Greeks would have conquered the world before the\r\nRomans.\r\n\r\nIf we can believe the exaggerated traditions of the old Greek\r\nhistorians, the famous army of Xerxes had not less than four thousand\r\nvessels; and this number is astonishing, even when we read the account\r\nof them by Herodotus. It is more difficult to believe that at the same\r\ntime, and by a concerted movement, five thousand other vessels landed\r\nthree hundred thousand Carthaginians in Sicily, where they were totally\r\ndefeated by Gelon on the same day that Themistocles destroyed the fleet\r\nof Xerxes at Salamis. Three other expeditions, under Hannibal, Imilcon,\r\nand Hamilcar, carried into Sicily from one hundred to one hundred and\r\nfifty thousand men: Agrigentum and Palermo were taken, Lilybæum was\r\nfounded, and Syracuse besieged twice. The third time Androcles, with\r\nfifteen thousand men, landed in Africa, and made Carthage tremble. This\r\ncontest lasted one year and a half.\r\n\r\nAlexander the Great crossed the Hellespont with only fifty thousand men:\r\nhis naval force was only one hundred and sixty sail, while the Persians\r\nhad four hundred; and to save his fleet Alexander sent it back to\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\nAfter Alexander's death, his generals, who quarreled about the division\r\nof the empire, made no important naval expedition.\r\n\r\nPyrrhus, invited by the inhabitants of Tarentum and aided by their\r\nfleet, landed in Italy with twenty-six thousand infantry, three thousand\r\nhorses, and the first elephants which had been seen in Italy. This was\r\ntwo hundred and eighty years before the Christian era.\r\n\r\nConqueror of the Romans at Heraclea and Ascoli, it is difficult to\r\nunderstand why he should have gone to Sicily at the solicitation of the\r\nSyracusans to expel the Carthaginians. Recalled, after some success, by\r\nthe Tarentines, he recrossed the straits, harassed by the Carthaginian\r\nfleet: then, reinforced by the Samnites or Calabrians, he, a little too\r\nlate, concluded to march on Rome. He in turn was beaten and repulsed on\r\nBeneventum, when he returned to Epirus with nine thousand men, which was\r\nall that remained of his force.\r\n\r\nCarthage, which had been prospering for a long time, profited by the\r\nruin of Tyre and the Persian empire.\r\n\r\nThe Punic wars between Carthage and Rome, now the preponderating power\r\nin Italy, were the most celebrated in the maritime annals of antiquity.\r\nThe Romans were particularly remarkable for the rapidity with which they\r\nimproved and increased their marine. In the year 264 B.C. their boats or\r\nvessels were scarcely fit to cross to Sicily; and eight years after\r\nfound Regulus conqueror at Ecnomos, with three hundred and forty large\r\nvessels, each with three hundred rowers and one hundred and twenty\r\ncombatants, making in all one hundred and forty thousand men. The\r\nCarthaginians, it is said, were stronger by twelve to fifteen thousand\r\nmen and fifty vessels.\r\n\r\nThe victory of Ecnomos--perhaps more extraordinary than that of\r\nActium--was the first important step of the Romans toward universal\r\nempire. The subsequent descent in Africa consisted of forty thousand\r\nmen; but the greater part of this force being recalled to Sicily, the\r\nremainder was overthrown, and Regulus, being made prisoner, became as\r\ncelebrated by his death as by his famous victory.\r\n\r\nThe great fleet which was to avenge him was successful at Clypea, but\r\nwas destroyed on its return by a storm; and its successor met the same\r\nfate at Cape Palinuro. In the year 249 B.C. the Romans were defeated at\r\nDrepanum, and lost twenty-eight thousand men and more than one hundred\r\nvessels. Another fleet, on its way to besiege Lilybæum, in the same\r\nyear, was lost off Cape Pactyrus.\r\n\r\nDiscouraged by this succession of disasters, the Senate at first\r\nresolved to renounce the sea; but, observing that the power of Sicily\r\nand Spain resulted from their maritime superiority, it concluded to arm\r\nits fleets again, and in the year 242 Lutatius Catullus set out with\r\nthree hundred galleys and seven hundred transports for Drepanum, and\r\ngained the battle in the Ægates Islands, in which the Carthaginians lost\r\none hundred and twenty vessels. This victory brought to a close the\r\nfirst Punic war.\r\n\r\nThe second, distinguished by Hannibal's expedition to Italy, was less\r\nmaritime in its character. Scipio, however, bore the Roman eagles to\r\nCartagena, and by its capture destroyed forever the empire of the\r\nCarthaginians in Spain. Finally, he carried the war into Africa with a\r\nforce inferior to that of Regulus; but still he succeeded in gaining the\r\nbattle of Zama, imposing a shameful peace on Carthage and burning five\r\nhundred of her ships. Subsequently Scipio's brother crossed the\r\nHellespont with twenty-five thousand men, and at Magnesia gained the\r\ncelebrated victory which surrendered to the mercy of the Romans the\r\nkingdom of Antiochus and all Asia. This expedition was aided by a\r\nvictory gained at Myonnesus in Ionia, by the combined fleets of Rome and\r\nRhodes, over the navy of Antiochus.\r\n\r\nFrom this time Rome had no rival, and she continued to add to her power\r\nby using every means to insure to her the empire of the sea. Paulus\r\nEmilius in the year 168 B.C. landed at Samothrace at the head of\r\ntwenty-five thousand men, conquered Perseus, and brought Macedonia to\r\nsubmission.\r\n\r\nTwenty years later, the third Punic war decided the fate of Carthage.\r\nThe important port of Utica having been given up to the Romans, an\r\nimmense fleet was employed in transporting to this point eighty thousand\r\nfoot-soldiers and four thousand horses; Carthage was besieged, and the\r\nson of Paulus Emilius and adopted son of the great Scipio had the glory\r\nof completing the victory which Emilius and Scipio had begun, by\r\ndestroying the bitter rival of his country.\r\n\r\nAfter this triumph, the power of Rome in Africa, as well as in Europe,\r\nwas supreme; but her empire in Asia was for a moment shaken by\r\nMithridates. This powerful king, after seizing in succession the small\r\nadjacent states, was in command of not less than two hundred and fifty\r\nthousand men, and of a fleet of four hundred vessels, of which three\r\nhundred were decked. He defeated the three Roman generals who commanded\r\nin Cappadocia, invaded Asia Minor and massacred there at least eighty\r\nthousand Roman subjects, and even sent a large army into Greece.\r\n\r\nSylla landed in Greece with a reinforcement of twenty-five thousand\r\nRomans, and retook Athens; but Mithridates sent in succession two large\r\narmies by the Bosporus and the Dardanelles: the first, one hundred\r\nthousand strong, was destroyed at Chæronea, and the second, of eighty\r\nthousand men, met a similar fate at Orchomenus. At the same time,\r\nLucullus, having collected all the maritime resources of the cities of\r\nAsia Minor, the islands, and particularly of Rhodes, was prepared to\r\ntransport Sylla's army from Sestos to Asia; and Mithridates, from fear,\r\nmade peace.\r\n\r\nIn the second and third wars, respectively conducted by Murena and\r\nLucullus, there were no descents effected. Mithridates, driven step by\r\nstep into Colchis, and no longer able to keep the sea, conceived the\r\nproject of turning the Black Sea by the Caucasus, in order to pass\r\nthrough Thrace to assume the offensive,--a policy which it is difficult\r\nto understand, in view of the fact that he was unable to defend his\r\nkingdom against fifty thousand Romans.\r\n\r\nCæsar, in his second descent on England, had six hundred vessels,\r\ntransporting forty thousand men. During the civil wars he transported\r\nthirty-five thousand men to Greece. Antony came from Brundusium to join\r\nhim with twenty thousand men, and passed through the fleet of\r\nPompey,--in which act he was as much favored by the lucky star of Cæsar\r\nas by the arrangements of his lieutenants.\r\n\r\nAfterward Cæsar carried an army of sixty thousand men to Africa; they\r\ndid not, however, go in a body, but in successive detachments.\r\n\r\nThe greatest armament of the latter days of the Roman republic was that\r\nof Augustus, who transported eighty thousand men and twelve thousand\r\nhorses into Greece to oppose Antony; for, besides the numerous\r\ntransports required for such an army, there were two hundred and sixty\r\nvessels of war to protect them. Antony was superior in force on land,\r\nbut trusted the empire of the world to a naval battle: he had one\r\nhundred and seventy war-vessels, in addition to sixty of Cleopatra's\r\ngalleys, the whole manned by twenty-two thousand choice troops, besides\r\nthe necessary rowers.\r\n\r\nLater, Germanicus conducted an expedition of one thousand vessels,\r\ncarrying sixty thousand men, from the mouths of the Rhine to the mouths\r\nof the Ems. Half of this fleet was destroyed on its return by a storm;\r\nand it is difficult to understand why Germanicus, controlling both banks\r\nof the Rhine, should have exposed his army to the chances of the sea,\r\nwhen he could have reached the same point by land in a few days.\r\n\r\nWhen the Roman authority extended from the Rhine to the Euphrates,\r\nmaritime expeditions were rare; and the great contest with the races of\r\nthe North of Europe, which began after the division of the empire, gave\r\nemployment to the Roman armies on the sides of Germany and Thrace. The\r\neastern fraction of the empire still maintained a powerful navy, which\r\nthe possession of the islands of the Archipelago made a necessity, while\r\nat the same time it afforded the means.\r\n\r\nThe first five centuries of the Christian era afford but few events of\r\ninterest in maritime warfare. The Vandals, having acquired Spain, landed\r\nin Africa, eighty thousand strong, under Genseric. They were defeated by\r\nBelisarius; but, holding the Balearic Isles and Sicily, they controlled\r\nthe Mediterranean for a time.\r\n\r\nAt the very epoch when the nations of the East invaded Europe, the\r\nScandinavians began to land on the coast of England. Their operations\r\nare little better known than those of the barbarians: they are hidden in\r\nthe mysteries of Odin.\r\n\r\nThe Scandinavian bards attribute two thousand five hundred vessels to\r\nSweden. Less poetical accounts assign nine hundred and seventy to the\r\nDanes and three hundred to Norway: these frequently acted in concert.\r\n\r\nThe Swedes naturally turned their attention to the head of the Baltic,\r\nand drove the Varangians into Russia. The Danes, more favorably situated\r\nwith respect to the North Sea, directed their course toward the coasts\r\nof France and England.\r\n\r\nIf the account cited by Depping is correct, the greater part of these\r\nvessels were nothing more than fishermen's boats manned by a score of\r\nrowers. There were also _snekars_, with twenty banks or forty rowers.\r\nThe largest had thirty-four banks of rowers. The incursions of the\r\nDanes, who had long before ascended the Seine and Loire, lead us to\r\ninfer that the greater part of these vessels were very small.\r\n\r\nHowever, Hengist, invited by the Briton Vortigern, transported five\r\nthousand Saxons to England in eighteen vessels,--which would go to show\r\nthat there were then also large vessels, or that the marine of the Elbe\r\nwas superior to that of the Scandinavians.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 527 and 584, three new expeditions, under Ida and\r\nCridda, gained England for the Saxons, who divided it into seven\r\nkingdoms; and it was not until three centuries had elapsed (833) that\r\nthey were again united under the authority of Egbert.\r\n\r\nThe African races, in their turn, visited the South of Europe. In 712,\r\nthe Moors crossed the Straits of Gibraltar, under the lead of Tarik.\r\nThey came, five thousand strong, at the invitation of Count Julian; and,\r\nfar from meeting great resistance, they were welcomed by the numerous\r\nenemies of the Visigoths. This was the happy era of the Caliphs, and the\r\nArabs might well pass for liberators in comparison with the tyrants of\r\nthe North. Tarik's army, soon swelled to twenty thousand men, defeated\r\nRodrigo at Jerez and reduced the kingdom to submission. In time, several\r\nmillions of the inhabitants of Mauritania crossed the sea and settled in\r\nSpain; and if their numerous migrations cannot be regarded as descents,\r\nstill, they form one of the most curious and interesting scenes in\r\nhistory, occurring between the incursions of the Vandals in Africa and\r\nthe Crusades in the East.\r\n\r\nA revolution not less important, and one which has left more durable\r\ntraces, marked in the North the establishment of the vast empire now\r\nknown as Russia. The Varangian princes, invited by the Novgorodians, of\r\nwhom Rurik was the chief, soon signalized themselves by great\r\nexpeditions.\r\n\r\nIn 902, Oleg is said to have embarked eighty thousand men in two\r\nthousand boats on the Dnieper: they passed the falls of the river and\r\ndebouched in the Black Sea, while their cavalry followed the banks. They\r\nproceeded to Constantinople, and forced Leo the Philosopher to pay\r\ntribute.\r\n\r\nForty years subsequently, Igor took the same route with a fleet said to\r\nhave consisted of ten thousand boats. Near Constantinople his fleet,\r\nterrified by the effects of the Greek fire, was driven on the coast of\r\nAsia, where the force was disembarked. It was defeated, and the\r\nexpedition returned home.\r\n\r\nNot discouraged, Igor re-established his fleet and army and descended to\r\nthe mouths of the Danube, where the Emperor Romanus I. sent to renew the\r\ntribute and ask for peace, (943.)\r\n\r\nIn 967, Svatoslav, favored by the quarrel of Nicephorus with the King of\r\nBulgaria, embarked sixty thousand men, debouched into the Black Sea,\r\nascended the Danube, and seized Bulgaria. Recalled by the Petchenegs,\r\nwho were menacing Kiew, he entered into alliance with them and returned\r\ninto Bulgaria, broke his alliance with the Greeks, and, being reinforced\r\nby the Hungarians, crossed the Balkan and marched to attack Adrianople.\r\nThe throne of Constantine was held by Zimisces, who was worthy of his\r\nposition. Instead of purchasing safety by paying tribute, as his\r\npredecessors had done, he raised one hundred thousand men, armed a\r\nrespectable fleet, repulsed Svatoslav at Adrianople, obliged him to\r\nretreat to Silistria, and took by assault the capital of the Bulgarians.\r\nThe Russian prince marched to meet him, and gave battle not far from\r\nSilistria, but was obliged to re-enter the place, where he sustained one\r\nof the most memorable sieges recorded in history.\r\n\r\nIn a second and still more bloody battle, the Russians performed\r\nprodigies of valor, but were again compelled to yield to numbers.\r\nZimisces, honoring courage, finally concluded an advantageous treaty.\r\n\r\nAbout this period the Danes were attracted to England by the hope of\r\npillage; and we are told that Lothaire called their king, Ogier, to\r\nFrance to be avenged of his brothers. The first success of these pirates\r\nincreased their fondness for this sort of adventure, and for five or six\r\nyears their bands swarmed on the coasts of France and Britain and\r\ndevastated the country. Ogier, Hastings, Regner, and Sigefroi conducted\r\nthem sometimes to the mouths of the Seine, sometimes to the mouths of\r\nthe Loire, and finally to those of the Garonne. It is even asserted that\r\nHastings entered the Mediterranean and ascended the Rhone to Avignon;\r\nbut this is, to say the least, doubtful. The strength of their fleets is\r\nnot known: the largest seems to have been of three hundred sail.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the tenth century, Rollo at first landed in England,\r\nbut, finding little chance of success against Alfred, he entered into\r\nalliance with him, landed in Neustria in 911, and advanced from Rouen on\r\nParis: other bodies marched from Nantes on Chartres. Repulsed here,\r\nRollo overran and ravaged the neighboring provinces. Charles the Simple\r\nsaw no better means of delivering his kingdom of this ever-increasing\r\nscourge than to offer Rollo the fine province of Neustria on condition\r\nthat he would marry his daughter and turn Christian,--an offer which was\r\neagerly accepted.\r\n\r\nThirty years later, Rollo's step-son, annoyed by the successors of\r\nCharles, called to his aid the King of Denmark. The latter landed in\r\nconsiderable force, defeated the French, took the king prisoner, and\r\nassured Rollo's son in the possession of Normandy.\r\n\r\nDuring the same interval (838 to 950) the Danes exhibited even greater\r\nhostility toward England than to France, although they were much more\r\nassimilated to the Saxons than to the French in language and customs.\r\nIvar, after pillaging the kingdom, established his family in\r\nNorthumberland. Alfred the Great, at first beaten by Ivar's successors,\r\nsucceeded in regaining his throne and in compelling the submission of\r\nthe Danes.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of affairs changes anew: Sweyn, still more fortunate than\r\nIvar, after conquering and devastating England, granted peace on\r\ncondition that a sum of money should be paid, and returned to Denmark,\r\nleaving a part of his army behind him.\r\n\r\nEthelred, who had weakly disputed with Sweyn what remained of the Saxon\r\npower, thought he could not do better to free himself from his\r\nimportunate guests than to order a simultaneous massacre of all the\r\nDanes in the kingdom, (1002.) But Sweyn reappeared in the following\r\nyear at the head of an imposing force, and between 1003 and 1007 three\r\nsuccessive fleets effected disembarkations on the coast, and unfortunate\r\nEngland was ravaged anew.\r\n\r\nIn 1012, Sweyn landed at the mouth of the Humber and again swept over\r\nthe land like a torrent, and the English, tired of obedience to kings\r\nwho could not defend them, recognized him as king of the North. His son,\r\nCanute the Great, had to contend with a rival more worthy of him,\r\n(Edmund Ironside.) Returning from Denmark at the head of a considerable\r\nforce, and aided by the perfidious Edric, Canute ravaged the southern\r\npart of England and threatened London. A new division of the kingdom\r\nresulted; but, Edmund having been assassinated by Edric, Canute was\r\nfinally recognized as king of all England. Afterward he sailed to\r\nconquer Norway, from which country he returned to attack Scotland. When\r\nhe died, he divided the kingdom between his three children, according to\r\nthe usage of the times.\r\n\r\nFive years after Canute's death, the English assigned the crown to their\r\nAnglo-Saxon princes; but Edward, to whom it fell, was better fitted to\r\nbe a monk than to save a kingdom a prey to such commotions. He died in\r\n1066, leaving to Harold a crown which the chief of the Normans settled\r\nin France contested with him, and to whom, it is said, Edward had made a\r\ncession of the kingdom. Unfortunately for Harold, this chief was a great\r\nand ambitious man.\r\n\r\nThe year 1066 was marked by two extraordinary expeditions. While William\r\nthe Conqueror was preparing in Normandy a formidable armament against\r\nHarold, the brother of the latter, having been driven from\r\nNorthumberland for his crimes, sought support in Norway, and, with the\r\nKing of Norway, set out with thirty thousand men on five hundred\r\nvessels, and landed at the mouth of the Humber. Harold almost entirely\r\ndestroyed this force in a bloody battle fought near York; but a more\r\nformidable storm was about to burst upon his head. William took\r\nadvantage of the time when the Anglo-Saxon king was fighting the\r\nNorwegians, to sail from St. Valery with a very large armament. Hume\r\nasserts that he had three thousand transports; while other authorities\r\nreduce the number to twelve hundred, carrying from sixty to seventy\r\nthousand men. Harold hastened from York, and fought a decisive battle\r\nnear Hastings, in which he met an honorable death, and his fortunate\r\nrival soon reduced the country to submission.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, another William, surnamed Bras-de-fer, Robert\r\nGuiscard, and his brother Roger, conquered Calabria and Sicily with a\r\nhandful of troops,(1058 to 1070.)\r\n\r\nScarcely thirty years after these memorable events, an enthusiastic\r\npriest animated Europe with a fanatical frenzy and precipitated large\r\nforces upon Asia to conquer the Holy Land.\r\n\r\nAt first followed by one hundred thousand men, afterward by two hundred\r\nthousand badly-armed vagabonds who perished in great part under the\r\nattacks of the Hungarians, Bulgarians, and Greeks, Peter the Hermit\r\nsucceeded in crossing the Bosporus, and arrived before Nice with from\r\nfifty to sixty thousand men, who were either killed or captured by the\r\nSaracens.\r\n\r\nAn expedition more military in its character succeeded this campaign of\r\nreligious pilgrims. One hundred thousand men, composed of French,\r\nBurgundians, Germans, and inhabitants of Lorraine, under Godfrey of\r\nBouillon, marched through Austria on Constantinople; an equal number,\r\nunder the Count of Toulouse, marched by Lyons, Italy, Dalmatia, and\r\nMacedonia; and Bohemond, Prince of Tarentum, embarked with a force of\r\nNormans, Sicilians, and Italians, and took the route by Greece on\r\nGallipolis.\r\n\r\nThis extensive migration reminds us of the fabulous expeditions of\r\nXerxes. The Genoese, Venetian, and Greek fleets were chartered to\r\ntransport these swarms of Crusaders by the Bosporus or Dardanelles to\r\nAsia. More than four hundred thousand men were concentrated on the\r\nplains of Nice, where they avenged the defeat of their predecessors.\r\nGodfrey afterward led them across Asia and Syria as far as Jerusalem,\r\nwhere he founded a kingdom.\r\n\r\nAll the maritime resources of Greece and the flourishing republics of\r\nItaly were required to transport these masses across the Bosporus and in\r\nprovisioning them during the siege of Nice; and the great impulse thus\r\ngiven to the coast states of Italy was perhaps the most advantageous\r\nresult of the Crusades.\r\n\r\nThis temporary success of the Crusaders became the source of great\r\ndisasters. The Mussulmans, heretofore divided among themselves, united\r\nto resist the infidel, and divisions began to appear in the Christian\r\ncamps. A new expedition was necessary to aid the kingdom which the brave\r\nNoureddin was threatening. Louis VII. and the Emperor Conrad, each at\r\nthe head of one hundred thousand Crusaders, marched, as their\r\npredecessors had done, by the route of Constantinople, (1142.) But the\r\nGreeks, frightened by the recurring visits of these menacing guests,\r\nplotted their destruction.\r\n\r\nConrad, who was desirous of being first, fell into the traps laid for\r\nhim by the Turks, and was defeated in detachments in several battles by\r\nthe Sultan of Iconium. Louis, more fortunate, defeated the Turks on the\r\nbanks of the Mender; but, being deprived of the support of Conrad, and\r\nhis army being annoyed and partially beaten by the enemy in the passage\r\nof defiles, and being in want of supplies, he was confined to Attalia,\r\non the coast of Pamphylia, where he endeavored to embark his army. The\r\nmeans furnished by the Greeks were insufficient, and not more than\r\nfifteen or twenty thousand men arrived at Antioch with the king: the\r\nremainder either perished or fell into the hands of the Saracens.\r\n\r\nThis feeble reinforcement soon melted away under the attacks of the\r\nclimate and the daily contests with the enemy, although they were\r\ncontinually aided by small bodies brought over from Europe by the\r\nItalian ships; and they were again about to yield under the attacks of\r\nSaladin, when the court of Rome succeeded in effecting an alliance\r\nbetween the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and the Kings of France and\r\nEngland to save the Holy Land.\r\n\r\nThe emperor was the first to set out. At the head of one hundred\r\nthousand Germans, he opened a passage through Thrace in spite of the\r\nformal resistance of the Greeks, now governed by Isaac Angelus. He\r\nmarched to Gallipolis, crossed the Dardanelles, and seized Iconium. He\r\ndied in consequence of an imprudent bath in a river, which, it has been\r\npretended, was the Cydnus. His son, the Duke of Swabia, annoyed by the\r\nMussulmans and attacked by diseases, brought to Ptolemais scarcely six\r\nthousand men.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Richard Coeur-de-Lion[58] and Philip Augustus more\r\njudiciously took the route over the sea, and sailed from Marseilles and\r\nGenoa with two immense fleets,(1190.) The first seized Cyprus, and both\r\nlanded in Syria,--where they would probably have triumphed but for the\r\nrivalry which sprang up between them, in consequence of which Philip\r\nreturned to France.\r\n\r\nTwelve years later, a new Crusade was determined upon, (1203.) Part of\r\nthe Crusaders embarked from Provence or Italy; others, led by the Count\r\nof Flanders and the Marquis of Montferrat, proceeded to Venice, with the\r\nintention of embarking there. The party last mentioned were persuaded by\r\nthe skillful Dandolo to aid him in an attack upon Constantinople, upon\r\nthe pretext of upholding the rights of Alexis Angelus, the son of Isaac\r\nAngelus, who had fought the Emperor Frederick and was the successor of\r\nthose Comnenuses who had connived at the destruction of the armies of\r\nConrad and Louis VII.\r\n\r\nTwenty thousand men had the boldness to attack the ancient capital of\r\nthe world, which had at least two hundred thousand defenders. They\r\nassailed it by sea and land, and captured it. The usurper fled, and\r\nAlexis was replaced upon the throne, but was unable to retain his seat:\r\nthe Greeks made an insurrection in favor of Murzupha, but the Latins\r\ntook possession of Constantinople after a more bloody assault than the\r\nfirst, and placed upon the throne their chief, Count Baldwin of\r\nFlanders. This empire lasted a half-century. The remnant of the Greeks\r\ntook refuge at Nice and Trebizond.\r\n\r\nA sixth expedition was directed against Egypt by John of Brienne, who,\r\nnotwithstanding the successful issue of the horrible siege of Damietta,\r\nwas obliged to give way before the constantly-increasing efforts of the\r\nMussulman population. The remains of his splendid army, after a narrow\r\nescape from drowning in the Nile, deemed themselves very fortunate in\r\nbeing able to purchase permission to re-embark for Europe.\r\n\r\nThe court of Rome, whose interest it was to keep up the zeal of\r\nChristendom in these expeditions, of which it gathered all the fruits,\r\nencouraged the German princes to uphold the tottering realm at\r\nJerusalem. The Emperor Frederick and the Landgrave of Hesse embarked at\r\nBrundusium in 1227, at the head of forty thousand chosen soldiers. The\r\nlandgrave, and afterward Frederick himself, fell sick, and the fleet put\r\nin at Tarentum, from which port the emperor, irritated by the\r\npresumption of Gregory IX., who excommunicated him because he was too\r\nslow in the gratification of his wishes, at a later date proceeded with\r\nten thousand men, thus giving way to the fear inspired by the pontifical\r\nthunders.\r\n\r\nLouis IX., animated by the same feeling of fear, or impelled, if we may\r\ncredit Ancelot, by motives of a higher character, set out from\r\nAigues-Mortes, in 1248, with one hundred and twenty large vessels, and\r\nfifteen hundred smaller boats, hired from the Genoese, the Venetians and\r\nthe Catalans; for France was at that time without a navy, although\r\nwashed by two seas. This king proceeded to Cyprus, and, having there\r\ncollected a still larger force, set out, according to Joinville's\r\nstatement, with more than eighteen hundred vessels, to make a descent\r\ninto Egypt. His army must have numbered about eighty thousand men; for,\r\nalthough half of the fleet was scattered and cast away upon the coast of\r\nSyria, he marched upon Cairo a few months later with sixty thousand\r\nfighting-men, twenty thousand being mounted. It should be stated that\r\nthe Count of Poictiers had arrived also with troops from France.\r\n\r\nThe sad fortune experienced by this splendid army did not prevent the\r\nsame king from engaging in a new Crusade, twenty years later,(1270.) He\r\ndisembarked upon that occasion at the ruins of Carthage, and besieged\r\nTunis. The plague swept off half his army in a few months, and himself\r\nwas one of its victims. The King of Sicily, having arrived with powerful\r\nreinforcements at the time of Louis's death, and desiring to carry back\r\nthe remains of the army to his island of Sicily, encountered a tempest\r\nwhich caused a loss of four thousand men and twenty large ships. This\r\nprince was not deterred by this misfortune from desiring the conquest of\r\nthe Greek empire and of Constantinople, which seemed a prize of greater\r\nvalue and more readily obtained. Philip, the son and successor of Saint\r\nLouis, being anxious to return to France, would have nothing to do with\r\nthat project. This was the last effort. The Christians who were\r\nabandoned in Syria were destroyed in the noted attacks of Tripoli and\r\nPtolemais: some of the remnants of the religious orders took refuge at\r\nCyprus and established themselves at Rhodes.\r\n\r\nThe Mussulmans, in their turn, crossed the Dardanelles at Gallipolis in\r\n1355, and took possession, one after the other, of the European\r\nprovinces of the Eastern Empire, to which the Latins had themselves\r\ngiven the fatal blow.\r\n\r\nMohammed II., while besieging Constantinople in 1453, is said to have\r\nhad his fleet transported by land with a view to placing it in the canal\r\nand closing the port: it is stated to have been large enough to be\r\nmanned by twenty thousand select foot-soldiers. After the capture of\r\nthis capital, Mohammed found his means increased by all those of the\r\nGreek navy, and in a short time his empire attained the first rank of\r\nmaritime powers. He ordered an attack to be made upon Rhodes and upon\r\nOtranto on the Italian main, whilst he proceeded to Hungary in search of\r\na more worthy opponent (Hunniades.) Repulsed and wounded at Belgrade,\r\nthe sultan fell upon Trebizond with a numerous fleet, brought that city\r\nto sue for terms, and then proceeded with a fleet of four hundred sail\r\nto make a landing upon the island of Negropont, which he carried by\r\nassault. A second attempt upon Rhodes, executed, it is stated, at the\r\nhead of a hundred thousand men, by one of his ablest lieutenants, was a\r\nfailure, with loss to the assailants. Mohammed was preparing to go to\r\nthat point himself with an immense army assembled on the shores of\r\nIonia, which Vertot estimates at three hundred thousand men; but death\r\nclosed his career, and the project was not carried into effect.\r\n\r\nAbout the same period England began to be formidable to her neighbors on\r\nland as well as on the sea; the Dutch also, reclaiming their country\r\nfrom the inroads of the sea, were laying the foundations of a power more\r\nextraordinary even than that of Venice.\r\n\r\nEdward III. landed in France and besieged Calais with eight hundred\r\nships and forty thousand men.\r\n\r\nHenry V. made two descents in 1414 and 1417: he had, it is stated,\r\nfifteen hundred vessels and only thirty thousand men, of whom six\r\nthousand were cavalry.\r\n\r\nAll the events we have described as taking place, up to this period, and\r\nincluding the capture of Constantinople, were before the invention of\r\ngunpowder; for if Henry V. had cannon at Agincourt, as is claimed by\r\nsome writers, they were certainly not used in naval warfare. From that\r\ntime all the combinations of naval armaments were entirely changed; and\r\nthis revolution took place--if I may use that expression--at the time\r\nwhen the invention of the mariner's compass and the discovery of America\r\nand of the Cape of Good Hope were about to turn the maritime commerce of\r\nthe world into new channels and to establish an entirely new system of\r\ncolonial dependencies.\r\n\r\nI shall not mention in detail the expeditions of the Spaniards to\r\nAmerica, or those of the Portuguese, Dutch, and English to India by\r\ndoubling the Cape of Good Hope. Notwithstanding their great influence\r\nupon the commerce of the world,--notwithstanding the genius of Gama,\r\nAlbuquerque, and Cortez,--these expeditions, undertaken by small bodies\r\nof two or three thousand men against tribes who knew nothing of\r\nfire-arms, are of no interest in a military point of view.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish navy, whose fame had been greatly increased by this\r\ndiscovery of a new world, was at the height of its splendor in the reign\r\nof Charles V. However, the glory of the expedition to Tunis, which was\r\nconquered by this prince at the head of thirty thousand fine soldiers\r\ntransported in five hundred Genoese or Spanish vessels, was balanced by\r\nthe disaster which befell a similar expedition against Algiers, (1541,)\r\nundertaken when the season was too far advanced and in opposition to the\r\nwise counsels of Admiral Doria. The expedition was scarcely under way\r\nwhen the emperor saw one hundred and sixty of his ships and eight\r\nthousand men swallowed up by the waves: the remainder was saved by the\r\nskill of Doria, and assembled at Cape Metafuz, where Charles V. himself\r\narrived, after encountering great difficulties and peril.\r\n\r\nWhile these events were transpiring, the successors of Mohammed were not\r\nneglecting the advantages given them by the possession of so many fine\r\nmaritime provinces, which taught them at once the importance of the\r\ncontrol of the sea and furnished means for obtaining it. At this period\r\nthe Turks were quite as well informed with reference to artillery and\r\nthe military art in general as the Europeans. They reached the apex of\r\ntheir greatness under Solyman I., who besieged and captured Rhodes\r\n(1552) with an army stated to have reached the number of one hundred and\r\nforty thousand men,--which was still formidable even upon the\r\nsupposition of its strength being exaggerated by one-half.\r\n\r\nIn 1565, Mustapha and the celebrated Dragut made a descent upon Malta,\r\nwhere the Knights of Rhodes had made a new establishment; they carried\r\nover thirty-two thousand Janissaries, with one hundred and forty ships.\r\nJohn of Valetta, as is well known, gained an enduring fame by repulsing\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA more formidable expedition, consisting of two hundred vessels and\r\nfifty-five thousand men, was sent in 1527 to the isle of Cyprus, where\r\nNicosia was taken and Famagosta besieged. The horrible cruelties\r\npracticed by Mustapha increased the alarm occasioned by his progress.\r\nSpain, Venice, Naples, and Malta united their naval forces to succor\r\nCyprus; but Famagosta had already surrendered, notwithstanding the\r\nheroic defense of Bragadino, who was perfidiously flayed alive by\r\nMustapha's order, to avenge the death of forty thousand Turks that had\r\nperished in the space of two years spent on the island.\r\n\r\nThe allied fleet, under the orders of two heroes, Don John of Austria,\r\nbrother of Philip II., and Andrea Doria, attacked the Turkish fleet at\r\nthe entrance of the Gulf of Lepanto, near the promontory of Actium,\r\nwhere Antony and Augustus once fought for the empire of the world. The\r\nTurkish fleet was almost entirely destroyed: more than two hundred\r\nvessels and thirty thousand Turks were captured or perished, (1571.)\r\nThis victory did not put an end to the supremacy of the Turks, but was a\r\ngreat check in their career of greatness. However, they made such\r\nvigorous efforts that as large a fleet as the former one was sent to sea\r\nduring the next year. Peace terminated this contest, in which such\r\nenormous losses were sustained.\r\n\r\nThe bad fortune of Charles V. in his expedition against Algiers did not\r\ndeter Sebastian of Portugal from wishing to attempt the conquest of\r\nMorocco, where he was invited by a Moorish prince who had been deprived\r\nof his estates. Having disembarked upon the shores of Morocco at the\r\nhead of twenty thousand men, this young prince was killed and his army\r\ncut to pieces at the battle of Alcazar by Muley Abdulmalek, in 1578.\r\n\r\nPhilip II., whose pride had increased since the naval battle of Lepanto\r\non account of the success he had gained in France by his diplomacy and\r\nby the folly of the adherents of the League, deemed his arms\r\nirresistible. He thought to bring England to his feet. The invincible\r\nArmada intended to produce this effect, which has been so famous, was\r\ncomposed of an expeditionary force proceeding from Cadiz, including,\r\naccording to Hume's narrative, one hundred and thirty-seven vessels,\r\narmed with two thousand six hundred and thirty bronze cannon, and\r\ncarrying twenty thousand soldiers, in addition to eleven thousand\r\nsailors. To these forces was to be added an army of twenty-five thousand\r\nmen which the Duke of Parma was to bring up from the Netherlands by way\r\nof Ostend. A tempest and the efforts of the English caused the failure\r\nof this expedition, which, although of considerable magnitude for the\r\nperiod when it appeared, was by no means entitled to the high-sounding\r\nname it received: it lost thirteen thousand men and half the vessels\r\nbefore it even came near the English coast.\r\n\r\nAfter this expedition comes in chronological order that of Gustavus\r\nAdolphus to Germany,(1630.) The army contained only from fifteen to\r\neighteen thousand men: the fleet was quite large, and was manned by nine\r\nthousand sailors; M. Ancillon must, however, be mistaken in stating that\r\nit carried eight thousand cannon. The debarkation in Pomerania received\r\nlittle opposition from the Imperial troops, and the King of Sweden had a\r\nstrong party among the German people. His successor was the leader of a\r\nvery extraordinary expedition, which is resembled by only one other\r\nexample mentioned in history: I refer to the march of Charles X. of\r\nSweden across the Belt upon the ice, with a view of moving from Sleswick\r\nupon Copenhagen by way of the island of Funen,(1658.) He had twenty-five\r\nthousand men, of whom nine thousand were cavalry, and artillery in\r\nproportion. This undertaking was so much the more rash because the ice\r\nwas unsafe, several pieces of artillery and even the king's own carriage\r\nhaving broken through and been lost.\r\n\r\nAfter seventy-five years of peace, the war between Venice and the Turks\r\nrecommenced in 1645. The latter transported an army of fifty-five\r\nthousand men, in three hundred and fifty vessels, to Candia, and gained\r\npossession of the important post of Canea before the republic thought of\r\nsending succor. Although the people of Venice began to lose the spirit\r\nwhich made her great, she still numbered among her citizens some noble\r\nsouls: Morosini, Grimani, and Mocenigo struggled several years against\r\nthe Turks, who derived great advantages from their numerical superiority\r\nand the possession of Canea. The Venetian fleet had, nevertheless,\r\ngained a marked ascendency under the orders of Grimani, when a third of\r\nit was destroyed by a frightful tempest, in which the admiral himself\r\nperished.\r\n\r\nIn 1648, the siege of Candia began. Jussuf attacked the city furiously\r\nat the head of thirty thousand men: after being repulsed in two\r\nassaults, he was encouraged to attempt a third by a large breach being\r\nmade. The Turks entered the place: Mocenigo rushed to meet them,\r\nexpecting to die in their midst. A brilliant victory was the reward of\r\nhis heroic conduct: the enemy were repulsed and the ditches filled with\r\ntheir dead bodies.\r\n\r\nVenice might have driven off the Turks by sending twenty thousand men to\r\nCandia; but Europe rendered her but feeble support, and she had already\r\ncalled into active service all the men fit for war she could produce.\r\n\r\nThe siege, resumed some time after, lasted longer than that of Troy, and\r\neach campaign was marked by fresh attempts on the part of the Turks to\r\ncarry succor to their army and by naval victories gained by the\r\nVenetians. The latter people had kept up with the advance of naval\r\ntactics in Europe, and thus were plainly superior to the Mussulmans, who\r\nadhered to the old customs, and were made to pay dearly for every\r\nattempt to issue from the Dardanelles. Three persons of the name of\r\nMorosini, and several Mocenigos, made themselves famous in this\r\nprotracted struggle.\r\n\r\nFinally, the celebrated Coprougli, placed by his merits at the head of\r\nthe Ottoman ministry, resolved to take the personal direction of this\r\nwar which had lasted so long: he accordingly proceeded to the island,\r\nwhere transports had landed fifty thousand men, at whose head he\r\nconducted the attack in a vigorous manner.(1667.)\r\n\r\nIn this memorable siege the Turks exhibited more skill than previously:\r\ntheir artillery, of very heavy caliber, was well served, and, for the\r\nfirst time, they made use of trenches, which were the invention of an\r\nItalian engineer.\r\n\r\nThe Venetians, on their side, greatly improved the methods of defense by\r\nmines. Never had there been seen such furious zeal exhibited in mutual\r\ndestruction by combats, mines, and assaults. Their heroic resistance\r\nenabled the garrison to hold out during winter: in the spring, Venice\r\nsent reinforcements and the Duke of Feuillade brought a few hundreds of\r\nFrench volunteers.\r\n\r\nThe Turks had also received strong reinforcements, and redoubled their\r\nefforts. The siege was drawing to a close, when six thousand Frenchmen\r\ncame to the assistance of the garrison under the leadership of the Duke\r\nof Beaufort and Navailles,(1669.) A badly-conducted sortie discouraged\r\nthese presumptuous young men, and Navailles, disgusted with the\r\nsufferings endured in the siege, assumed the responsibility, at the end\r\nof two months, of carrying the remnant of his troops back to France.\r\nMorosini, having then but three thousand exhausted men to defend a place\r\nwhich was open on all sides, finally consented to evacuate it, and a\r\ntruce was agreed upon, which led to a formal treaty of peace. Candia had\r\ncost the Turks twenty-five years of efforts and more than one hundred\r\nthousand men killed in eighteen assaults and several hundred sorties. It\r\nis estimated that thirty-five thousand Christians of different nations\r\nperished in the glorious defense of the place.\r\n\r\nThe struggle between Louis XIV., Holland, and England gives examples of\r\ngreat maritime operations, but no remarkable descents. That of James II.\r\nin Ireland (1690) was composed of only six thousand Frenchmen, although\r\nDe Tourville's fleet contained seventy-three ships of the line, carrying\r\nfive thousand eight hundred cannon and twenty-nine thousand sailors. A\r\ngrave fault was committed in not throwing at least twenty thousand men\r\ninto Ireland with such means as were disposable. Two years later, De\r\nTourville had been conquered in the famous day of La Hogue, and the\r\nremains of the troops which had landed were enabled to return through\r\nthe instrumentality of a treaty which required their evacuation of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the eighteenth century, the Swedes and Russians\r\nundertook two expeditions very different in character.\r\n\r\nCharles XII., wishing to aid the Duke of Holstein, made a descent upon\r\nDenmark at the head of twenty thousand men, transported by two hundred\r\nvessels and protected by a strong squadron. He was really assisted by\r\nthe English and Dutch navies, but the expedition was not for that reason\r\nthe less remarkable in the details of the disembarkation. The same\r\nprince effected a descent into Livonia to aid Narva, but he landed his\r\ntroops at a Swedish port.\r\n\r\nPeter the Great, having some cause of complaint against the Persians,\r\nand wishing to take advantage of their dissensions, embarked (in 1722)\r\nupon the Volga: he entered the Caspian Sea with two hundred and seventy\r\nvessels, carrying twenty thousand foot-soldiers, and descended to\r\nAgrakhan, at the mouths of the Koisou, where he expected to meet his\r\ncavalry. This force, numbering nine thousand dragoons and five thousand\r\nCossacks, joined him after a land-march by way of the Caucasus. The czar\r\nthen seized Derbent, besieged Bakou, and finally made a treaty with one\r\nof the parties whose dissensions at that time filled with discord the\r\nempire of the Soofees: he procured the cession of Astrabad, the key of\r\nthe Caspian Sea and, in some measure, of the whole Persian empire.\r\n\r\nThe time of Louis XV. furnished examples of none but secondary\r\nexpeditions, unless we except that of Richelieu against Minorca, which\r\nwas very glorious as an escalade, but less extraordinary as a descent.\r\n\r\n[In 1762, an English fleet sailed from Portsmouth: this was joined by a\r\nportion of the squadron from Martinico. The whole amounted to nineteen\r\nships of the line, eighteen smaller vessels of war, and one hundred and\r\nfifty transports, carrying ten thousand men. The expedition besieged and\r\ncaptured Havana.--TRS.]\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards, however, in 1775, made a descent with fifteen or sixteen\r\nthousand men upon Algiers, with a view of punishing those rovers of the\r\nsea for their bold piracies; but the expedition, for want of harmonious\r\naction between the squadron and the land-forces, was unsuccessful, on\r\naccount of the murderous fire which the troops received from the\r\nTurkish and Arab musketeers dispersed among the undergrowth surrounding\r\nthe city. The troops returned to their vessels after having two thousand\r\nmen placed _hors de combat_.\r\n\r\nThe American war (1779) was the epoch of the greatest maritime efforts\r\nupon the part of the French. Europe was astonished to see this power\r\nsend Count d'Estaing to America with twenty-five ships of the line,\r\nwhile at the same time M. Orvilliers, with a Franco-Spanish fleet of\r\nsixty-five ships of the line, was to cover a descent to be effected with\r\nthree hundred transports and forty thousand men, assembled at Havre and\r\nSt. Malo.\r\n\r\nThis new armada moved back and forth for several months, but\r\naccomplished nothing: the winds finally drove it back to port.\r\n\r\nD'Estaing was more fortunate, as he succeeded in getting the superiority\r\nin the Antilles and in landing in the United States six thousand\r\nFrenchmen under Rochambeau, who were followed, at a later date, by\r\nanother division, and assisted in investing the English army under\r\nCornwallis at Yorktown, (1781:) the independence of America was thus\r\nsecured. France would perhaps have gained a triumph over her implacable\r\nrival more lasting in its effects, had she, in addition to the display\r\nmade in the English Channel, sent ten ships and seven or eight thousand\r\nmen more to India with Admiral Suffren.\r\n\r\nDuring the French Revolution, there were few examples of descents: the\r\nfire at Toulon, emigration, and the battle of Ushant had greatly injured\r\nthe French navy.\r\n\r\nHoche's expedition against Ireland with twenty-five thousand men was\r\nscattered by the winds, and no further attempts in that quarter were\r\nmade. (1796.)\r\n\r\nAt a later date, Bonaparte's expedition to Egypt, consisting of\r\ntwenty-three thousand men, thirteen ships, seventeen frigates, and four\r\nhundred transports, obtained great successes at first, which were\r\nfollowed by sad reverses. The Turks, in hopes of expelling him, landed\r\nfifteen thousand men at Aboukir, but were all captured or driven into\r\nthe sea, notwithstanding the advantages this peninsula gave them of\r\nintrenching themselves and waiting for reinforcements. This is an\r\nexcellent example for imitation by the party on the defensive under\r\nsimilar circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe expedition of considerable magnitude which was sent out in 1802 to\r\nSt. Domingo was remarkable as a descent, but failed on account of the\r\nravages of yellow fever.\r\n\r\nSince their success against Louis XIV., the English have given their\r\nattention more to the destruction of rival fleets and the subjugation of\r\ncolonies than to great descents. The attempts made in the eighteenth\r\ncentury against Brest and Cherbourg with bodies of ten or twelve\r\nthousand men amounted to nothing in the heart of a powerful state like\r\nFrance. The remarkable conquests which procured them their Indian empire\r\noccurred in succession. Having obtained possession of Calcutta, and then\r\nof Bengal, they strengthened themselves gradually by the arrival of\r\ntroops in small bodies and by using the Sepoys, whom they disciplined to\r\nthe number of one hundred and fifty thousand.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Russian expedition to Holland in 1799 was composed of forty\r\nthousand men, but they were not all landed at once: the study of the\r\ndetails of the operations is, however, quite interesting.\r\n\r\nIn 1801, Abercrombie, after threatening Ferrol and Cadiz, effected a\r\ndescent into Egypt with twenty thousand Englishmen. The results of this\r\nexpedition are well known.\r\n\r\nGeneral Stuart's expedition to Calabria, (1806,) after some successes at\r\nMaida, was for the purpose of regaining possession of Sicily. That\r\nagainst Buenos Ayres was more unfortunate in its results, and was\r\nterminated by a capitulation.\r\n\r\nIn 1807, Lord Cathcart attacked Copenhagen with twenty-five thousand\r\nmen, besieged and bombarded the city, and gained possession of the\r\nDanish fleet, which was his object.\r\n\r\nIn 1808, Wellington appeared in Portugal with fifteen thousand men.\r\nAfter gaining the victory of Vimeira, and assisted by the general rising\r\nof the Portuguese, he forced Junot to evacuate the kingdom. The same\r\narmy, increased in numbers to twenty-five thousand and placed under\r\nMoore's command, while making an effort to penetrate into Spain with a\r\nview of relieving Madrid, was forced to retreat to Corunna and there\r\nre-embark, after suffering severe losses. Wellington, having effected\r\nanother landing in Portugal with reinforcements, collected an army of\r\nthirty thousand Englishmen and as many Portuguese, with which he avenged\r\nMoore's misfortunes by surprising Soult at Oporto, (May, 1809,) and then\r\nbeating Joseph at Talavera, under the very gates of his capital.\r\n\r\nThe expedition to Antwerp in the same year was one of the largest\r\nEngland has undertaken since the time of Henry V. It was composed of not\r\nless than seventy thousand men in all,--forty thousand land-forces and\r\nthirty thousand sailors. It did not succeed, on account of the\r\nincapacity of the leader.\r\n\r\nA descent entirely similar in character to that of Charles X. of Sweden\r\nwas effected by thirty Russian battalions passing the Gulf of Bothnia on\r\nthe ice in five columns, with their artillery. Their object was to take\r\npossession of the islands of Aland and spread a feeling of apprehension\r\nto the very gates of Stockholm. Another division passed the gulf to\r\nUmeå, (March, 1809.)\r\n\r\nGeneral Murray succeeded in effecting a well-planned descent in the\r\nneighborhood of Tarragona in 1813, with the intention of cutting Suchet\r\noff from Valencia: however, after some successful operations, he thought\r\nbest to re-embark.\r\n\r\nThe expedition set on foot by England against Napoleon after his return\r\nfrom Elba in 1815 was remarkable on account of the great mass of\r\n_matériel_ landed at Ostend and Antwerp. The Anglo-Hanoverian army\r\ncontained sixty thousand men, but some came by land and others were\r\ndisembarked at a friendly port.\r\n\r\nThe English engaged in an undertaking in the same year which may be\r\nregarded as very extraordinary: I refer to the attack on the capital of\r\nthe United States. The world was astonished to see a handful of seven or\r\neight thousand Englishmen making their appearance in the midst of a\r\nstate embracing ten millions of people, taking possession of its\r\ncapital, and destroying all the public buildings,--results unparalleled\r\nin history. We would be tempted to despise the republican and unmilitary\r\nspirit of the inhabitants of those states if the same militia had not\r\nrisen, like those of Greece, Rome, and Switzerland, to defend their\r\nhomes against still more powerful attacks, and if, in the same year, an\r\nEnglish expedition more extensive than the other had not been entirely\r\ndefeated by the militia of Louisiana and other states under the orders\r\nof General Jackson.\r\n\r\nIf the somewhat fabulous numbers engaged in the irruption of Xerxes and\r\nthe Crusades be excepted, no undertaking of this kind which has been\r\nactually carried out, especially since fleets have been armed with\r\npowerful artillery, can at all be compared with the gigantic project and\r\nproportionate preparations made by Napoleon for throwing one hundred and\r\nfifty thousand veterans upon the shores of England by the use of three\r\nthousand launches or large gun-boats, protected by sixty ships of the\r\nline[59].\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding narrative the reader will perceive what a difference\r\nthere is in point of difficulty and probability of success between\r\ndescents attempted across a narrow arm of the sea, a few miles only in\r\nwidth, and those in which the troops and _matériel_ are to be\r\ntransported long distances over the open sea. This fact gives the reason\r\nwhy so many operations of this kind have been executed by way of the\r\nBosporus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[The following paragraphs have been compiled from authentic data:--\r\n\r\nIn 1830, the French government sent an expedition to Algiers, composed\r\nof an army of thirty-seven thousand five hundred men and one hundred and\r\neighty pieces of artillery. More than five hundred vessels of war and\r\ntransports were employed. The fleet sailed from Toulon.\r\n\r\nIn 1838, France sent a fleet of twenty-two vessels to Vera Cruz. The\r\ncastle of San Juan d'Ulloa fell into their hands after a short\r\nbombardment. A small force of about one thousand men, in three columns,\r\ntook the city of Vera Cruz by assault: the resistance was slight.\r\n\r\nIn 1847, the United States caused a descent to be made upon the coast of\r\nMexico, at Vera Cruz, with an army of thirteen thousand men, under the\r\ncommand of General Scott. One hundred and fifty vessels were employed,\r\nincluding men-of-war and transports. The city of Vera Cruz and the\r\ncastle of San Juan d'Ulloa speedily fell into the possession of the\r\nforces of the United States. This important post became the secondary\r\nbase of operations for the brilliant campaign which terminated with the\r\ncapture of the city of Mexico.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 commenced the memorable and gigantic contest between Russia on\r\nthe one side and England, France, Sardinia, and Turkey on the other.\r\nSeveral descents were made by the allied forces at different points of\r\nthe Russian coast: of these the first was in the Baltic Sea. An English\r\nfleet sailed from Spithead, under the command of Sir Charles Napier, on\r\nthe 12th of March, and a French fleet from Brest, under the command of\r\nVice-Admiral Parseval Deschênes, on the 19th of April. They effected a\r\njunction in the Bay of Barosund on the 11th of June. The allied fleet\r\nnumbered thirty ships and fifty frigates, corvettes, and other vessels.\r\nThe naval commanders wished to attack the defenses of Bomarsund, on one\r\nof the Aland Isles, but, after a reconnoissance, they came to the\r\nconclusion that it was necessary to have land-forces. A French corps of\r\nten thousand men was at once dispatched to Bomarsund under General\r\nBaraguay-d'Hilliers, and the place was speedily reduced.\r\n\r\nLater in the same year, the great expedition to the Crimea was executed;\r\nand with reference to it the following facts are mentioned, in order to\r\ngive an idea of its magnitude:--\r\n\r\nSeptember 14, 1854, an army of fifty-eight thousand five hundred men and\r\ntwo hundred pieces of artillery was landed near Eupatoria, composed of\r\nthirty thousand French, twenty-one thousand five hundred English, and\r\nseven thousand Turks. They were transported from Varna to the place of\r\nlanding by three hundred and eighty-nine ships, steamers, and\r\ntransports. This force fought and gained the battle of the Alma,\r\n(September 20,) and thence proceeded to Sebastopol. The English took\r\npossession of the harbor of Balaklava and the French of Kamiesch: these\r\nwere the points to which subsequent reinforcements and supplies for the\r\narmy in the Crimea were sent.\r\n\r\nNovember 5, at the battle of Inkermann, the allied army numbered\r\nseventy-one thousand men.\r\n\r\nAt the end of January, 1855, the French force was seventy-five thousand\r\nmen and ten thousand horses. Up to the same time, the English had sent\r\nfifty-four thousand men to the Crimea, but only fifteen thousand were\r\nalive, present, and fit for duty.\r\n\r\nFebruary 4, the French numbered eighty-five thousand; the English,\r\ntwenty-five thousand fit for duty; the Turks, twenty-five thousand.\r\n\r\nMay 8, 1855, General La Marmora arrived at Balaklava with fifteen\r\nthousand Sardinians.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of May, an expedition of sixteen thousand men was\r\nsent to Kertch.\r\n\r\nIn August, the French force at Sebastopol had risen to one hundred and\r\ntwenty thousand men.\r\n\r\nSeptember 8, the final assault took place, which resulted in the\r\nevacuation of the place by the Russians. The allies had then in battery\r\nmore than eight hundred pieces of artillery.\r\n\r\nThe fleet which co-operated with the land-forces in the artillery attack\r\nof October 17, 1854, consisted of twenty-five ships. There were present\r\nand prepared to attack in September, 1855, thirty-four ships.\r\n\r\nOctober, 1855, an expeditionary force of nine thousand men was sent to\r\nKinburn, which place was captured.\r\n\r\nMarshal Vaillant, in his report, as Minister of War, to the French\r\nemperor, says there were sent from France and Algeria three hundred and\r\nten thousand men and forty thousand horses, of which two hundred and\r\ntwenty-seven thousand men returned to France and Algeria.\r\n\r\nThe marshal's report gives the following striking facts, (he refers only\r\nto French operations:-)\r\n\r\nThe artillery _matériel_ at the disposal of the Army of the East\r\ncomprised one thousand seven hundred guns, two thousand gun-carriages,\r\ntwo thousand seven hundred wagons, two millions of projectiles, and nine\r\nmillion pounds of powder. There were sent to the army three thousand\r\ntons of powder, seventy millions of infantry-cartridges, two hundred and\r\nseventy thousand rounds of fixed ammunition, and eight thousand\r\nwar-rockets.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the final assault there were one hundred and eighteen\r\nbatteries, which during the siege had consumed seven million pounds of\r\npowder. They required one million sand-bags and fifty thousand gabions.\r\n\r\nOf engineer materials, fourteen thousand tons were sent. The engineers\r\nexecuted fifty miles of trenches, using eighty thousand gabions, sixty\r\nthousand fascines, and one million sand-bags.\r\n\r\nOf subsistence, fuel, and forage, five hundred thousand tons were sent.\r\n\r\nOf clothing, camp-equipage, and harness, twelve thousand tons.\r\n\r\nHospital stores, six thousand five hundred tons.\r\n\r\nProvision-wagons, ambulances, carts, forges, &c, eight thousand tons.\r\n\r\nIn all, about six hundred thousand tons.\r\n\r\nIt is not thought necessary to add similar facts for the English,\r\nSardinian, and Turkish armies.\r\n\r\nIn 1859, the Spaniards made a descent upon Morocco with a force of forty\r\nthousand infantry, eleven squadrons of cavalry, and eighty pieces of\r\nartillery, using twenty-one vessels of war with three hundred and\r\ntwenty-seven guns, besides twenty-four gun-boats and numerous\r\ntransports.\r\n\r\nIn 1860, a force of English and French was landed on the coast of China,\r\nwhence they marched to Pekin and dictated terms of peace. This\r\nexpedition is remarkable for the smallness of the numbers which\r\nventured, at such a great distance from their sources of supply and\r\nsuccor, to land upon a hostile shore and penetrate into the midst of the\r\nmost populous empire in the world.\r\n\r\nThe French expedition to Syria in 1860 was small in numbers, and\r\npresented no remarkable features.\r\n\r\nToward the close of the year 1861, the government of the United States\r\nsent an expedition of thirteen thousand men to Port Royal, on the coast\r\nof South Carolina, one of the seceding States. The fleet of war-vessels\r\nand transports sailed from Hampton Roads, under command of Captain\r\nDupont, and was dispersed by a violent gale: the losses of men and\r\n_matériel_ were small, however, and the fleet finally reached the\r\nrendezvous. The defenses of the harbor having been silenced by the naval\r\nforces, the disembarkation of the land-troops took place, General\r\nSherman being in command.\r\n\r\nEngland, France, and Spain are now (January 16, 1862) engaged in an\r\nexpedition directed against Mexico. The first operations were the\r\ncapture, by the Spanish forces, of Vera Cruz and its defenses: the\r\nMexicans offered no resistance at that point. The future will develop\r\nthe plans of the allies; but the ultimate result of a struggle (if,\r\nindeed, one be attempted by the Mexicans) cannot be doubted, when three\r\nof the most powerful states of Europe are arrayed against the feeble and\r\ntottering republic of Mexico.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: Richard sailed from England with twenty thousand foot and\r\nfive thousand horsemen, and landed in Normandy, whence he proceeded by\r\nland to Marseilles. We do not know what fleet he employed to transport\r\nhis troops to Asia. Philip embarked at Genoa on Italian ships, and with\r\na force at least as large as that of Richard.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: See the account of the expedition to
