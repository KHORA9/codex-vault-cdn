And,\r\nalthough I sought in vain for a chronological account of the festival,\r\nI discovered many interesting details of its observances dispersed in\r\nthe works of various authors; and, while I found that some of its\r\ngreater celebrations marked important epochs in our national history,\r\nI saw, also, that the successive celebrations of Christmas during\r\nnineteen centuries were important links in the chain of historical\r\nChristian evidences. I became enamoured of the subject, for, in\r\naddition to historical interest, there is the charm of its legendary\r\nlore, its picturesque customs, and popular games. It seemed to me that\r\nthe origin and hallowed associations of Christmas, its ancient customs\r\nand festivities, and the important part it has played in history\r\ncombine to make it a most fascinating subject. I resolved, therefore,\r\nto collect materials for a larger work on _Christmas_.\r\n\r\nHenceforth, I became a snapper-up of everything relating to\r\nChristmastide, utilised every opportunity of searching libraries,\r\nbookstalls, and catalogues of books in different parts of the country,\r\nand, subsequently, as a Reader of the British Museum Library, had\r\naccess to that vast storehouse of literary and historical treasures.\r\n\r\nSoon after commencing the work, I realised that I had entered a very\r\nspacious field of research, and that, having to deal with the\r\naccumulated materials of nineteen centuries, a large amount of labour\r\nwould be involved, and some years must elapse before, even if\r\ncircumstances proved favourable, I could hope to see the end of my\r\ntask. Still, I went on with the work, for I felt that a complete\r\naccount of Christmas, ancient and modern, at home and abroad, would\r\nprove generally acceptable, for while the historical events and\r\nlegendary lore would interest students and antiquaries, the holiday\r\nsports and popular celebrations would be no less attractive to general\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\nThe love of story-telling seems to be ingrained in human nature.\r\nTravellers tell of vari-coloured races sitting round their watch fires\r\nreciting deeds of the past; and letters from colonists show how, even\r\namidst forest-clearing, they have beguiled their evening hours by\r\ntelling or reading stories as they sat in the glow of their camp\r\nfires. And in old England there is the same love of tales and stories.\r\nOne of the chief delights of Christmastide is to sit in the united\r\nfamily circle and hear, tell, or read about the quaint habits and\r\npicturesque customs of Christmas in the olden time; and one of the\r\npurposes of _CHRISTMAS_ is to furnish the retailer of Christmas wares\r\nwith suitable things for re-filling his pack.\r\n\r\nFrom the vast store of materials collected it is not possible to do\r\nmore than make a selection. How far I have succeeded in setting forth\r\nthe subject in a way suited to the diversity of tastes among readers I\r\nmust leave to their judgment and indulgence; but I have this\r\nsatisfaction, that the gems of literature it contains are very rich\r\nindeed; and I acknowledge my great indebtedness to numerous writers of\r\ndifferent periods whose references to Christmas and its time-honoured\r\ncustoms are quoted.\r\n\r\nI have to acknowledge the courtesy of Mr. Henry Jewitt, Mr. E.\r\nWiseman, Messrs. Harper, and Messrs. Cassell & Co., in allowing their\r\nillustrations to appear in this work.\r\n\r\nMy aim is neither critical nor apologetic, but historical and\r\npictorial: it is not to say what might or ought to have been, but to\r\nset forth from extant records what has actually taken place: to give\r\nan account of the origin and hallowed associations of Christmas, and\r\nto depict, by pen and pencil, the important historical events and\r\ninteresting festivities of Christmastide during nineteen centuries.\r\nWith materials collected from different parts of the world, and from\r\nwritings both ancient and modern, I have endeavoured to give in the\r\npresent work a chronological account of the celebrations and\r\nobservances of Christmas from the birth of Christ to the end of the\r\nnineteenth century; but, in a few instances, the subject-matter has\r\nbeen allowed to take precedence of the chronological arrangement. Here\r\nwill be found accounts of primitive celebrations of the Nativity,\r\necclesiastical decisions fixing the date of Christmas, the connection\r\nof Christmas with the festivals of the ancients, Christmas in times of\r\npersecution, early celebrations in Britain, stately Christmas meetings\r\nof the Saxon, Danish, and Norman kings of England; Christmas during\r\nthe wars of the Roses, Royal Christmases under the Tudors, the Stuarts\r\nand the Kings and Queens of Modern England; Christmas at the Colleges\r\nand the Inns of Court; Entertainments of the nobility and gentry, and\r\npopular festivities; accounts of Christmas celebrations in different\r\nparts of Europe, in America and Canada, in the sultry lands of Africa\r\nand the ice-bound Arctic coasts, in India and China, at the Antipodes,\r\nin Australia and New Zealand, and in the Islands of the Pacific; in\r\nshort, throughout the civilised world.\r\n\r\nIn looking at the celebrations of Christmas, at different periods and\r\nin different places, I have observed that, whatever views men hold\r\nrespecting Christ, they all agree that His Advent is to be hailed with\r\njoy, and the nearer the forms of festivity have approximated to the\r\nteaching of Him who is celebrated the more real has been the joy of\r\nthose who have taken part in the celebrations.\r\n\r\nThe descriptions of the festivities and customs of different periods\r\nare given, as far as possible, on the authority of contemporary\r\nauthors, or writers who have special knowledge of those periods, and\r\nthe most reliable authorities have been consulted for facts and dates,\r\ngreat care being taken to make the work as accurate and trustworthy as\r\npossible. I sincerely wish that all who read it may find as much\r\npleasure in its perusal as I have had in its compilation.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM FRANCIS DAWSON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Contents]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.

F. D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER I._\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN AND ASSOCIATIONS OF CHRISTMAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST CHRISTMAS: THE ADVENT OF CHRIST.\r\n\r\n  Behold, a virgin shall conceive,\r\n  And bear a Son,\r\n  And shall call His name Immanuel.\r\n\r\n  (_Isaiah_ vii. 14.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNow the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When His mother Mary\r\nhad been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found\r\nwith child of the Holy Ghost. And Joseph her husband, being a\r\nrighteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, was\r\nminded to put her away privily. But when he thought on these things,\r\nbehold, an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying,\r\nJoseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife:\r\nfor that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And she shall\r\nbring forth a Son; and thou shalt call His name Jesus; for it is He\r\nthat shall save His people from their sins. Now all this is come to\r\npass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through\r\nthe prophet, saying,\r\n\r\n  Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a Son,\r\n  And they shall call His name Immanuel;\r\n\r\nwhich is, being interpreted, God with us. And Joseph arose from his\r\nsleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took unto\r\nhim his wife; and knew her not till she had brought forth a Son; and\r\nhe called His name Jesus.\r\n\r\n(_Matthew_ i. 18-25.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"There went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the\r\nworld should be taxed. And Joseph went to be taxed with Mary his\r\nespoused wife, being great with child.\" (_Luke_ ii. 1-5.)]\r\n\r\nAnd there were shepherds in the same country abiding in the field,\r\nand keeping watch by night over their flock. And an angel of the Lord\r\nstood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and\r\nthey were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Be not afraid;\r\nfor behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to\r\nall the people: for there is born to you this day in the city of David\r\na Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this is the sign unto you; Ye\r\nshall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger.\r\nAnd suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host\r\npraising God, and saying,\r\n\r\n  Glory to God in the highest,\r\n  And on earth peace among men in whom He is well pleased.\r\n\r\nAnd it came to pass, when the angels went away from them into heaven,\r\nthe shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem,\r\nand see this thing that is come to pass, which the Lord hath made\r\nknown unto us. And they came with haste, and found both Mary and\r\nJoseph, and the Babe lying in the manger. And when they saw it, they\r\nmade known concerning the saying which was spoken to them about this\r\nchild. And all that heard it wondered at the things which were spoken\r\nunto them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering\r\nthem in her heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising\r\nGod for all the things that they had heard and seen, even as it was\r\nspoken unto them.\r\n\r\n(_Luke_ ii. 8-20.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLACE OF THE NATIVITY.\r\n\r\nThe evangelist Matthew tells us that \"Jesus was born in Bethlehem of\r\nJudaea in the days of Herod the king;\" and Justin Martyr, who was born\r\nat Shechem and lived less than a century after the time of Christ,\r\nplaces the scene of the Nativity in a cave. Over this cave has risen\r\nthe Church and Convent of the Nativity, and there is a stone slab with\r\na star cut in it to mark the spot where the Saviour was born. Dean\r\nFarrar, who has been at the place, says: \"It is impossible to stand in\r\nthe little Chapel of the Nativity, and to look without emotion on the\r\nsilver star let into the white marble, encircled by its sixteen\r\neverburning lamps, and surrounded by the inscription, '_Hic de Virgine\r\nMaria Jesus Christus natus est_.'\"\r\n\r\nTo visit such a scene is to have the thoughts carried back to the\r\ngreatest event in the world's history, for it has been truly said that\r\nthe birth of Christ was the world's second birthday.\r\n\r\n  Now, death is life! and grief is turn'd to joy!\r\n    Since glory shone on that auspicious morn,\r\n  When God incarnate came, not to destroy,\r\n    But man to save and manhood's state adorn!\r\n\r\n  W. F. D.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Nativity by Sandro Botticelli\r\nCentre Portion of Picture in National Gallery]\r\n\r\nTHE WORD \"CHRISTMAS\": ITS ORTHOGRAPHY AND MEANING.\r\n\r\n\"Christmas\" (pronounced Kris'mas) signifies \"Christ's Mass,\" meaning\r\nthe festival of the Nativity of Christ, and the word has been\r\nvariously spelt at different periods. The following are obsolete forms\r\nof it found in old English writings: Crystmasse, Cristmes, Cristmas,\r\nCrestenmes, Crestenmas, Cristemes, Cristynmes, Crismas, Kyrsomas,\r\nXtemas, Cristesmesse, Cristemasse, Crystenmas, Crystynmas, Chrystmas,\r\nChrystemes, Chrystemasse, Chrystymesse, Cristenmas, Christenmas,\r\nChristmass, Christmes. Christmas has also been called _Noel_ or\r\n_Nowel_. As to the derivation of the word _Noel_, some say it is a\r\ncontraction of the French _nouvelles_ (tidings), _les bonnes\r\nnouvelles_, that is \"The good news of the Gospel\"; others take it as\r\nan abbreviation of the Gascon or Provencal _nadaue_, _nadal_, which\r\nmeans the same as the Latin _natalis_, that is, _dies natalis_, \"the\r\nbirthday.\" In \"The Franklin's Tale,\" Chaucer alludes to \"Nowel\" as a\r\nfestive cry at Christmastide: \"And 'Nowel' crieth every lusty man.\"\r\nSome say _Noel_ is a corruption of _Yule_, _Jule_, or _Ule_, meaning\r\n\"The festival of the sun.\" The name _Yule_ is still applied to the\r\nfestival in Scotland, and some other places. Christmas is represented\r\nin Welsh by _Nadolig_, which signifies \"the natal, or birth\"; in\r\nFrench by _Noel_; and in Italian by _Il Natale_, which, together with\r\nits cognate term in Spanish, is simply a contraction of _dies\r\nnatalis_, \"the birthday.\"\r\n\r\n  CHRISTMAS: blest Feast of the Nativity!\r\n  H eaven made thy lowly shrine\r\n  R esplendent with the gift of the eternal Deity\r\n  I n whom we live and move, whose large benignity\r\n  S pared not His Son divine:\r\n  T hat well-beloved Son by God was given,\r\n  M ankind to save with His redeeming blood;\r\n  A nd Jesus freely left the bliss of Heaven,\r\n  S uffering death, to achieve our lasting good.--W.

And the Wise Men, who came\r\nafterwards with presents from the East, being led to Bethlehem by the\r\nappearance of the miraculous star, may also be regarded as taking part\r\nin the first celebration of the Nativity, for the name Epiphany (now\r\nused to commemorate the manifestation of the Saviour) did not come\r\ninto use till long afterwards, and when it was first adopted among the\r\nOriental Churches it was designed to commemorate both the birth and\r\nbaptism of Jesus, which two events the Eastern Churches believed to\r\nhave occurred on January 6th. Whether the shepherds commemorated the\r\nFeast of the Nativity annually does not appear from the records of the\r\nEvangelists; but it is by no means improbable that to the end of their\r\nlives they would annually celebrate the most wonderful event which\r\nthey had witnessed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADORATION OF THE MAGI (Relievo.)\r\nFrom Pulpit of Pisa Nicola: Pisano]\r\n\r\nWithin thirty years after the death of our Lord, there were churches\r\nin Jerusalem, Caesarea, Rome, and the Syrian Antioch. In reference to\r\nthe latter, Bishop Ken beautifully says:--\r\n\r\n  \"Fair Antioch the rich, the great,\r\n  Of learning the imperial seat,\r\n      You readily inclined,\r\n      To light which on you shined;\r\n  It soon shot up to a meridian flame,\r\n  You first baptized it with a Christian name.\"\r\n\r\nClement, one of the Apostolic Fathers and third Bishop of Rome, who\r\nflourished in the first century, says: \"Brethren, keep diligently\r\nfeast-days, and truly in the first place the day of Christ's birth.\"\r\nAnd according to another of the early Bishops of Rome, it was ordained\r\nearly in the second century, \"that in the holy night of the Nativity\r\nof our Lord and Saviour, they do celebrate public church services and\r\nin them solemnly sing the Angels' Hymn, because also the same night He\r\nwas declared unto the shepherds by an angel, as the truth itself doth\r\nwitness.\"\r\n\r\nBut, before proceeding further with the historical narrative, it will\r\nbe well now to make more particular reference to the fixing of the\r\ndate of the festival.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIXING THE DATE OF CHRISTMAS.\r\n\r\nWhether the 25th of December, which is now observed as Christmas Day,\r\ncorrectly fixes the period of the year when Christ was born is still\r\ndoubtful, although it is a question upon which there has been much\r\ncontroversy. From Clement of Alexandria it appears, that when the\r\nfirst efforts were made to fix the season of the Advent, there were\r\nadvocates for the 20th of May, and for the 20th or 21st of April. It\r\nis also found that some communities of Christians celebrated the\r\nfestival on the 1st or 6th of January; others on the 29th of March,\r\nthe time of the Jewish Passover: while others observed it on the 29th\r\nof September, or Feast of Tabernacles. The Oriental Christians\r\ngenerally were of opinion that both the birth and baptism of Christ\r\ntook place on the 6th of January. Julius I., Bishop of Rome (A.D.\r\n337-352), contended that the 25th of December was the date of Christ's\r\nbirth, a view to which the majority of the Eastern Church ultimately\r\ncame round, while the Church of the West adopted from their brethren\r\nin the East the view that the baptism was on the 6th of January. It\r\nis, at any rate, certain that after St. Chrysostom Christmas was\r\nobserved on the 25th of December in East and West alike, except in the\r\nArmenian Church, which still remains faithful to January 6th. St.\r\nChrysostom, who died in the beginning of the fifth century, informs\r\nus, in one of his Epistles, that Julius, on the solicitation of St.\r\nCyril of Jerusalem, caused strict inquiries to be made on the subject,\r\nand thereafter, following what seemed to be the best authenticated\r\ntradition, settled authoritatively the 25th of December as the\r\nanniversary of Christ's birth, the _Festorum omnium metropolis_, as it\r\nis styled by Chrysostom. It may be observed, however, that some have\r\nrepresented this fixing of the day to have been accomplished by St.\r\nTelesphorus, who was Bishop of Rome A.D. 127-139, but the authority\r\nfor the assertion is very doubtful. There is good ground for\r\nmaintaining that Easter and its accessory celebrations mark with\r\ntolerable accuracy the anniversaries of the Passion and Resurrection\r\nof our Lord, because we know that the events themselves took place at\r\nthe period of the Jewish Passover; but no such precision of date can\r\nbe adduced as regards Christmas. Dr. Geikie[1] says: \"The _season_ at\r\nwhich Christ was born is inferred from the fact that He was six months\r\nyounger than John, respecting the date of whose birth we have the help\r\nof knowing the time of the annunciation during his father's\r\nministrations in Jerusalem. Still, the whole subject is very\r\nuncertain. Ewald appears to fix the date of the birth as five years\r\nearlier than our era. Petavius and Usher fix it as on the 25th of\r\nDecember, five years before our era; Bengel, on the 25th of December,\r\nfour years before our era; Anger and Winer, four years before our era,\r\nin the spring; Scaliger, three years before our era, in October; St.\r\nJerome, three years before our era, on December 25th; Eusebius, two\r\nyears before our era, on January 6th; and Ideler, seven years before\r\nour era, in December.\" Milton, following the immemorial tradition of\r\nthe Church, says that--\r\n\r\n  \"It was the winter wild.\"\r\n\r\nBut there are still many who think that the 25th of December does not\r\ncorrespond with the actual date of the birth of Christ, and regard the\r\nincident of the flocks and shepherds in the open field, recorded by\r\nSt. Luke, as indicative of spring rather than winter. This incident,\r\nit is thought, could not have taken place in the inclement month of\r\nDecember, and it has been conjectured, with some probability, that the\r\n25th of December was chosen in order to substitute the purified joy of\r\na Christian festival for the license of the _Bacchanalia_ and\r\n_Saturnalia_ which were kept at that season. It is most probable that\r\nthe Advent took place between December, 749, of Rome, and February,\r\n750.\r\n\r\nDionysius Exiguus, surnamed the Little, a Romish monk of the sixth\r\ncentury, a Scythian by birth, and who died A.D. 556, fixed the birth\r\nof Christ in the year of Rome 753, but the best authorities are now\r\nagreed that 753 was not the year in which the Saviour of mankind was\r\nborn. The Nativity is now placed, not as might have been expected, in\r\nA.D. 1, but in B.C. 5 or 4. The mode of reckoning by the \"year of our\r\nLord\" was first introduced by Dionysius, in his \"Cyclus Paschalis,\" a\r\ntreatise on the computation of Easter, in the first half of the sixth\r\ncentury. Up to that time the received computation of events through\r\nthe western portion of Christendom had been from the supposed\r\nfoundation of Rome (B.C. 754), and events were marked accordingly as\r\nhappening in this or that year, _Anno Urbis Conditae_, or by the\r\ninitial letters A.U.C. In the East some historians continued to reckon\r\nfrom the era of Seleucidae, which dated from the accession of Seleucus\r\nNicator to the monarchy of Syria, in B.C. 312. The new computation was\r\nreceived by Christendom in the sixth century, and adopted without\r\nadequate inquiry, till the sixteenth century. A more careful\r\nexamination of the data presented by the Gospel history, and, in\r\nparticular, by the fact that \"Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea\"\r\nbefore the death of Herod, showed that Dionysius had made a mistake of\r\nfour years, or perhaps more, in his calculations. The death of Herod\r\ntook place in the year of Rome A.U.C. 750, just before the Passover.\r\nThis year coincided with what in our common chronology would be B.C.\r\n4--so that we have to recognise the fact that our own reckoning is\r\nerroneous, and to fix B.C. 5 or 4 as the date of the Nativity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE INNS ARE FULL.\"]\r\n\r\nNow, out of the consideration of the time at which the Christmas\r\nfestival is fixed, naturally arises another question, viz.:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONNECTION OF CHRISTMAS WITH ANCIENT FESTIVALS.\r\n\r\nSir Isaac Newton[2] says the Feast of the Nativity, and most of the\r\nother ecclesiastical anniversaries, were originally fixed at cardinal\r\npoints of the year, without any reference to the dates of the\r\nincidents which they commemorated, dates which, by lapse of time, it\r\nwas impossible to ascertain. Thus the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary\r\nwas placed on the 25th of March, or about the time of the vernal\r\nequinox; the Feast of St. Michael on the 29th of September, or near\r\nthe autumnal equinox; and the Birth of Christ at the time of the\r\nwinter solstice. Christmas was thus fixed at the time of the year when\r\nthe most celebrated festivals of the ancients were held in honour of\r\nthe return of the sun which at the winter solstice begins gradually to\r\nregain power and to ascend apparently in the horizon. Previously to\r\nthis (says William Sandys, F.S.A.),[3] the year was drawing to a\r\nclose, and the world was typically considered to be in the same state.\r\nThe promised restoration of light and commencement of a new era were\r\ntherefore hailed with rejoicings and thanksgivings. The Saxon and\r\nother northern nations kept a festival at this time of the year in\r\nhonour of Thor, in which they mingled feasting, drinking, and dancing\r\nwith sacrifices and religious rites. It was called Yule, or Jule, a\r\nterm of which the derivation has caused dispute amongst antiquaries;\r\nsome considering it to mean a festival, and others stating that Iol,\r\nor Iul (spelt in various ways), is a primitive word, conveying the\r\nidea of Revolution or Wheel, and applicable therefore to the return of\r\nthe sun. The _Bacchanalia_ and _Saturnalia_ of the Romans had\r\napparently the same object as the Yuletide, or feast of the Northern\r\nnations, and were probably adopted from some more ancient nations, as\r\nthe Greeks, Mexicans, Persians, Chinese, &c., had all something\r\nsimilar. In the course of them, as is well known, masters and slaves\r\nwere supposed to be on an equality; indeed, the former waited on the\r\nlatter.[4] Presents were mutually given and received, as Christmas\r\npresents in these days. Towards the end of the feast, when the sun was\r\non its return, and the world was considered to be renovated, a king or\r\nruler was chosen, with considerable power granted to him during his\r\nephemeral reign, whence may have sprung some of the Twelfth-Night\r\nrevels, mingled with those in honour of the Manifestation and\r\nAdoration of the Magi. And, in all probability, some other Christmas\r\ncustoms are adopted from the festivals of the ancients, as decking\r\nwith evergreens and mistletoe (relics of Druidism) and the wassail\r\nbowl. It is not surprising, therefore, that Bacchanalian illustrations\r\nhave been found among the decorations in the early Christian Churches.\r\nThe illustration on the following page is from a mosaic in the Church\r\nof St. Constantine, Rome, A.D. 320.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAPE GATHERING AND THE VINTAGE.\r\nMOSAIC IN THE CHURCH OF ST. CONSTANTINE, ROME, A.D. 320.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM AN IVORY (PART OF BOOK COVER)\r\nGERMAN NINTH CENTURY BRITISH MUSEUM]\r\n\r\nDr. Cassel, of Germany, an erudite Jewish convert who is little known\r\nin this country, has endeavoured to show that the festival of\r\nChristmas has a Judaean origin. He considers that its customs are\r\nsignificantly in accordance with those of the Jewish festival of the\r\nDedication of the Temple. This feast was held in the winter time, on\r\nthe 25th of Cisleu (December 20th), having been founded by Judas\r\nMaccabaeus in honour of the cleansing of the Temple in B.C. 164, six\r\nyears and a half after its profanation by Antiochus Epiphanes. In\r\nconnection with Dr. Cassel's theory it may be remarked that the German\r\nword _Weihnachten_ (from _weihen_, \"to consecrate, inaugurate,\" and\r\n_nacht_, \"night\") leads directly to the meaning, \"Night of the\r\nDedication.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT ROMAN ILLUSTRATIONS.]\r\n\r\nIn proceeding with our historical survey, then, we must recollect that\r\nin the festivities of Christmastide there is a mingling of the Divine\r\nwith the human elements of society--the establishment and development\r\nof a Christian festival on pagan soil and in the midst of\r\nsuperstitious surroundings. Unless this be borne in mind it is\r\nimpossible to understand some customs connected with the celebration\r\nof Christmas. For while the festival commemorates the Nativity of\r\nChrist, it also illustrates the ancient practices of the various\r\npeoples who have taken part in the commemoration, and not\r\ninappropriately so, as the event commemorated is also linked to the\r\npast. \"Christmas\" (says Dean Stanley) \"brings before us the relations\r\nof the Christian religion to the religions which went before; for the\r\nbirth at Bethlehem was itself a link with the past. The coming of\r\nJesus Christ was not unheralded or unforeseen. Even in the heathen\r\nworld there had been anticipations of an event of a character not\r\nunlike this. In Plato's Dialogue bright ideals had been drawn of the\r\njust man; in Virgil's Eclogues there had been a vision of a new and\r\npeaceful order of things. But it was in the Jewish nation that these\r\nanticipations were most distinct. That wonderful people in all its\r\nhistory had looked, not backward, but forward. The appearance of Jesus\r\nChrist was not merely the accomplishment of certain predictions; it\r\nwas the fulfilment of this wide and deep expectation of a whole\r\npeople, and that people the most remarkable in the ancient world.\"\r\nThus Dean Stanley links Christianity with the older religions of the\r\nworld, as other writers have connected the festival of Christmas with\r\nthe festivals of paganism and Judaism. The first Christians were\r\nexposed to the dissolute habits and idolatrous practices of\r\nheathenism, as well as the superstitious ceremonials of Judaism, and\r\nit is in these influences that we must seek the true origin of many of\r\nthe usages and institutions of Christianity. The old hall of Roman\r\njustice and exchange--an edifice expressive of the popular life of\r\nGreece and Rome--was not deemed too secular to be used as the first\r\nChristian place of worship: pagan statues were preserved as objects of\r\nadoration, being changed but in name; names describing the functions\r\nof Church officers were copied from the civil vocabulary of the time;\r\nthe ceremonies of Christian worship were accommodated as far as\r\npossible to those of the heathen, that new converts might not be much\r\nstartled at the change, and at the Christmas festival Christians\r\nindulged in revels closely resembling those of the _Saturnalia_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT ROMAN ILLUSTRATIONS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS IN TIMES OF PERSECUTION.\r\n\r\nIt is known that the Feast of the Nativity was observed as early as\r\nthe first century, and that it was kept by the primitive Christians\r\neven in dark days of persecution. \"They wandered in deserts, and in\r\nmountains, and in dens and caves of the earth\" (Heb. xi. 38). Yet they\r\nwere faithful to Christ, and the Catacombs of Rome contain evidence\r\nthat they celebrated the Nativity.\r\n\r\nThe opening up of these Catacombs has brought to light many most\r\ninteresting relics of primitive Christianity. In these Christian\r\ncemeteries and places of worship there are signs not only of the deep\r\nemotion and hope with which they buried their dead, but also of their\r\nsimple forms of worship and the festive joy with which they\r\ncommemorated the Nativity of Christ. On the rock-hewn tombs these\r\nprimitive Christians wrote the thoughts that were most consoling to\r\nthemselves, or painted on the walls the figures which gave them the\r\nmost pleasure. The subjects of these paintings are for the most part\r\ntaken from the Bible, and the one which illustrates the earliest and\r\nmost universal of these pictures, and exhibits their Christmas joy, is\r\n\"The Adoration of the Magi.\" Another of these emblems of joyous\r\nfestivity which is frequently seen, is a vine, with its branches and\r\npurple clusters spreading in every direction, reminding us that in\r\nEastern countries the vintage is the great holiday of the year. In the\r\nJewish Church there was no festival so joyous as the Feast of\r\nTabernacles, when they gathered the fruit of the vineyard, and in some\r\nof the earlier celebrations of the Nativity these festivities were\r\nclosely copied. And as all down the ages pagan elements have mingled\r\nin the festivities of Christmas, so in the Catacombs they are not\r\nabsent. There is Orpheus playing on his harp to the beasts; Bacchus as\r\nthe god of the vintage; Psyche, the butterfly of the soul; the Jordan\r\nas the god of the rivers. The classical and the Christian, the Hebrew\r\nand the Hellenic elements had not yet parted; and the unearthing of\r\nthese pictures after the lapse of centuries affords another\r\ninteresting clue to the origin of some of the customs of\r\nChristmastide. It is astonishing how many of the Catacomb decorations\r\nare taken from heathen sources and copied from heathen paintings; yet\r\nwe need not wonder when we reflect that the vine was used by the early\r\nChristians as an emblem of gladness, and it was scarcely possible for\r\nthem to celebrate the Feast of the Nativity--a festival of glad\r\ntidings--without some sort of _Bacchanalia_. Thus it appears that even\r\nbeneath the palaces and temples of pagan Rome the birth of Christ was\r\ncelebrated, this early undermining of paganism by Christianity being,\r\nas it were, the germ of the final victory, and the secret praise,\r\nwhich came like muffled music from the Catacombs in honour of the\r\nNativity, the prelude to the triumph-song in which they shall unite\r\nwho receive from Christ the unwithering crown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT AGAPE.\r\n\r\n(_From Withrow's_ \"_Catacombs of Rome_,\" which states that the\r\ninscriptions, according to Dr. Maitland, should be expanded thus IRENE\r\nDA CALDA[M AQVAM]--\"Peace, give hot water,\" and AGAPE MISCE MI [VINVM\r\nCVM AQVA]--\"Love, mix me wine with water,\" the allusion being to the\r\nancient custom of tempering wine with water, hot or cold)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut they who would wear the crown must first bear the cross, and these\r\nearly Christians had to pass through dreadful days of persecution.\r\nSome of them were made food for the torches of the atrocious Nero,\r\nothers were thrown into the Imperial fish-ponds to fatten lampreys for\r\nthe Bacchanalian banquets, and many were mangled to death by savage\r\nbeasts, or still more savage men, to make sport for thousands of\r\npitiless sightseers, while not a single thumb was turned to make the\r\nsign of mercy. But perhaps the most gigantic and horrible of all\r\nChristmas atrocities were those perpetrated by the tyrant Diocletian,\r\nwho became Emperor A.D. 284. The early years of his reign were\r\ncharacterised by some sort of religious toleration, but when his\r\npersecutions began many endured martyrdom, and the storm of his fury\r\nburst on the Christians in the year 303. A multitude of Christians of\r\nall ages had assembled to commemorate the Nativity in the temple at\r\nNicomedia, in Bithynia, when the tyrant Emperor had the town\r\nsurrounded by soldiers and set on fire, and about twenty thousand\r\npersons perished. The persecutions were carried on throughout the\r\nRoman Empire, and the death-roll included some British martyrs,\r\nBritain being at that time a Roman province. St. Alban, who was put to\r\ndeath at Verulam in Diocletian's reign, is said to have been the first\r\nChristian martyr in Britain. On the retirement of Diocletian, satiated\r\nwith slaughter and wearied with wickedness, Galerius continued the\r\npersecutions for a while. But the time of deliverance was at hand, for\r\nthe martyrs had made more converts in their deaths than in their\r\nlives. It was vainly hoped that Christianity would be destroyed, but\r\nin the succeeding reign of Constantine it became the religion of the\r\nempire. Not one of the martyrs had died in vain or passed through\r\ndeath unrecorded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n \"There is a record traced on high,\r\n  That shall endure eternally;\r\n  The angel standing by God's throne\r\n  Treasures there each word and groan;\r\n  And not the martyr's speech alone,\r\n  But every word is there depicted,\r\n    With every circumstance of pain\r\n  The crimson stream, the gash inflicted--\r\n    And not a drop is shed in vain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCELEBRATIONS UNDER CONSTANTINE THE GREAT.\r\n\r\nWith the accession of Constantine (born at York, February 27, 274, son\r\nof the sub-Emperor Constantius by a British mother, the \"fair Helena\r\nof York,\" and who, on the death of his father at York in 306, was in\r\nBritain proclaimed Emperor of the Roman Empire) brighter days came to\r\nthe Christians, for his first act was one of favour to them. He had\r\nbeen present at the promulgation of Diocletian's edict of the last and\r\nfiercest of the persecutions against the Christians, in 303, at\r\nNicomedia, soon after which the imperial palace was struck by\r\nlightning, and the conjunction of the events seems to have deeply\r\nimpressed him. No sooner had he ascended the throne than his good\r\nfeeling towards the Christians took the active form of an edict of\r\ntoleration, and subsequently he accepted Christianity, and his example\r\nwas followed by the greater part of his family. And now the\r\nChristians, who had formerly hidden away in the darkness of the\r\nCatacombs and encouraged one another with \"Alleluias,\" which served as\r\na sort of invitatory or mutual call to each other to praise the Lord,\r\nmight come forth into the Imperial sunshine and hold their services in\r\nbasilicas or public halls, the roofs of which (Jerome tells us)\r\n\"re-echoed with their cries of Alleluia,\" while Ambrose says the sound\r\nof their psalms as they sang in celebration of the Nativity \"was like\r\nthe surging of the sea in great waves of sound.\" And the Catacombs\r\ncontain confirmatory evidence of the joy with which relatives of the\r\nEmperor participated in Christian festivities. In the tomb of\r\nConstantia, the sister of the Emperor Constantine, the only\r\ndecorations are children gathering the vintage, plucking the grapes,\r\ncarrying baskets of grapes on their heads, dancing on the grapes to\r\npress out the wine. This primitive conception of the Founder of\r\nChristianity shows the faith of these early Christians to have been of\r\na joyous and festive character, and the Graduals for Christmas Eve and\r\nChristmas morning, the beautiful Kyrie Eleisons (which in later times\r\npassed into carols), and the other festival music which has come down\r\nto us through that wonderful compilation of Christian song, _Gregory's\r\nAntiphonary_, show that Christmas stood out prominently in the\r\ncelebrations of the now established Church, for the Emperor\r\nConstantine had transferred the seat of government to Constantinople,\r\nand Christianity was formally recognised as the established religion.\r\n\r\n\r\nEPISCOPAL REFERENCES TO CHRISTMAS AND CAUTIONS AGAINST EXCESSES.\r\n\r\nCyprian, the intrepid Bishop of Carthage, whose stormy episcopate\r\nclosed with the crown of martyrdom in the latter half of the third\r\ncentury, began his treatise on the Nativity thus: \"The much wished-for\r\nand long expected Nativity of Christ is come, the famous solemnity is\r\ncome\"--expressions which indicate the desire with which the Church\r\nlooked forward to the festival, and the fame which its celebrations\r\nhad acquired in the popular mind. And in later times, after the\r\nfulness of festivity at Christmas had resulted in some excesses,\r\nBishop Gregory Nazianzen (who died in 389), fearing the spiritual\r\nthanksgiving was in danger of being subordinated to the temporal\r\nrejoicing, cautioned all Christians \"against feasting to excess,\r\ndancing, and crowning the doors (practices derived from the heathens);\r\nurging the celebration of the festival after an heavenly and not an\r\nearthly manner.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Council, generally called _Concilium Africanum_, held A.D. 408,\r\n\"stage-playes and spectacles are forbidden on the Lord's-day,\r\nChristmas-day, and other solemn Christian festivalls.\" Theodosius the\r\nyounger, in his laws _de Spectaculis_, in 425, forbade shows or games\r\non the Nativity, and some other feasts. And in the Council of Auxerre,\r\nin Burgundy, in 578, disguisings are again forbidden, and at another\r\nCouncil, in 614, it was found necessary to repeat the prohibitory\r\ncanons in stronger terms, declaring it to be unlawful to make any\r\nindecent plays upon the Kalends of January, according to the profane\r\npractices of the pagans. But it is also recorded that the more devout\r\nChristians in these early times celebrated the festival without\r\nindulging in the forbidden excesses.\r\n\r\n    [1] Notes to \"Life of Christ.\"\r\n\r\n    [2] \"Commentary on the Prophecies of Daniel.\"\r\n\r\n    [3] Introduction to \"Christmas Carols,\" 1833.\r\n\r\n    [4] The Emperor Nero himself is known to have presided at\r\n    the _Saturnalia_, having been made by lot the _Rex\r\n    bibendi_, or Master of the Revels. Indeed it was at one of\r\n    these festivals that he instigated the murder of the young\r\n    Prince Britannicus, the last male descendant of the family\r\n    of the Claudii, who had been expelled from his rights by\r\n    violence and crime; and the atrocious act was committed\r\n    amid the revels over which Nero was presiding as master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER III._\r\n\r\nEARLY CHRISTMAS CELEBRATIONS IN BRITAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nEARLY CELEBRATIONS IN BRITAIN.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded that there were \"saints in Caesar's household,\" and we\r\nhave also the best authority for saying there were converts among\r\nRoman soldiers. Cornelius, a Roman centurion, \"was a just man and one\r\nthat feared God,\" and other Roman converts are referred to in\r\nScripture as having been found among the officers of the Roman Empire.\r\nAnd although it is not known who first preached the Gospel in Britain,\r\nit seems almost certain that Christianity entered with the Roman\r\ninvasion in A.D. 43. As in Palestine some of the earlier converts\r\nserved Christ secretly \"for fear of the Jews,\" so, in all probability,\r\ndid they in Britain for fear of the Romans. We know that some\r\nconfessed Christ and closed their earthly career with the crown of\r\nmartyrdom. It is also certain that very early in the Christian era\r\nChristmas was celebrated in Britain, mingling in its festivities some\r\nof the winter-festival customs of the ancient Britons and the Roman\r\ninvaders, for traces of those celebrations are still seen in some of\r\nthe Christmas customs of modern times. Moreover, it is known that\r\nChristians were tolerated in Britain by some of the Roman governors\r\nbefore the days of Constantine. It was in the time of the fourth Roman\r\nEmperor, Claudius, that part of Britain was first really conquered.\r\nClaudius himself came over in the year 43, and his generals afterwards\r\nwent on with the war, conquering one after another of the British\r\nchiefs, Caradoc, whom the Romans called Caractacus, holding out the\r\nlongest and the most bravely. This intrepid King of the Silurians, who\r\nlived in South Wales and the neighbouring parts, withstood the Romans\r\nfor several years, but was at last defeated at a great battle,\r\nsupposed to have taken place in Shropshire, where there is a hill\r\nstill called Caer Caradoc. Caradoc and his family were taken prisoners\r\nand led before the Emperor at Rome, when he made a remarkable speech\r\nwhich has been preserved for us by Tacitus. When he saw the splendid\r\ncity of Rome, he wondered that an Emperor who lived in such splendour\r\nshould have meddled with his humble home in Britain; and in his\r\naddress before the Emperor Claudius, who received him seated on his\r\nthrone with the Empress Agrippina by his side, Caradoc said: \"My fate\r\nthis day appears as sad for me as it is glorious for thee. I had\r\nhorses, soldiers, arms, and treasures; is it surprising that I should\r\nregret the loss of them? If it is thy will to command the universe, is\r\nit a reason we should voluntarily accept slavery? Had I yielded\r\nsooner, thy fortune and my glory would have been less, and oblivion\r\nwould soon have followed my execution. If thou sparest my life, I\r\nshall be an eternal monument of thy clemency.\" Although the Romans had\r\nvery often killed their captives, to the honour of Claudius be it said\r\nthat he treated Caradoc kindly, gave him his liberty, and, according\r\nto some historians, allowed him to reign in part of Britain as a\r\nprince subject to Rome. It is surprising that an emperor who had shown\r\nsuch clemency could afterwards become one of Rome's sanguinary\r\ntyrants; but Claudius was a man of weak intellect.\r\n\r\nThere were several of the Roman Emperors and Governors who befriended\r\nthe Christians, took part in their Christmas festivities, and\r\nprofessed faith in Christ. The Venerable Bede says: \"In the reign of\r\nMarcus Aurelius Antonius, and his partner in the Empire, Lucius Verus,\r\nwhen Eleutherius was Bishop of Rome, Lucius, a British king, sent a\r\nletter to his prelate, desiring his directions to make him a\r\nChristian. The holy bishop immediately complied with this pious\r\nrequest; and thus the Britons, being brought over to Christianity,\r\ncontinued without warping or disturbance till the reign of the Emperor\r\nDiocletian.\" And Selden says: \"Howsoever, by injury of time, the\r\nmemory of this great and illustrious Prince King Lucy hath been\r\nembezzled and smuggled; this, upon the credit of the ancient writers,\r\nappears plainly, that the pitiful fopperies of the Pagans, and the\r\nworship of their idol devils, did begin to flag, and within a short\r\ntime would have given place to the worship of the true God.\" As this\r\n\"illustrious Prince King Lucy\"--Lucius Verus--flourished in the latter\r\npart of the second century, and is credited with the erection of our\r\nfirst Christian Church on the site of St. Martin's, at Canterbury, it\r\nseems clear that even in those early days Christianity was making\r\nprogress in Britain. From the time of Julius Agricola, who was Roman\r\nCommander from 78 to 84, Britain had been a Roman province, and\r\nalthough the Romans never conquered the whole of the island, yet\r\nduring their occupation of what they called their province (the whole\r\nof Britain, excepting that portion north of the Firths of Forth and\r\nClyde), they encouraged the Christmas festivities and did much to\r\ncivilise the people whom they had conquered and whom they governed for\r\nmore than three hundred years. They built towns in different parts of\r\nthe country and constructed good roads from one town to another, for\r\nthey were excellent builders and road-makers. Some of the Roman\r\nemperors visited Britain and others were chosen by the soldiers of\r\nBritain; and in the reigns of Constantine the Great and other tolerant\r\nemperors the Britains lived like Romans, adopted Roman manners and\r\ncustoms, and some of them learned to speak the Latin language.\r\nChristian churches were built and bishoprics founded; a hierarchy was\r\nestablished, and at the Council of Arles, in 314, three British\r\nbishops took part--those of York, London, and Camulodunum (which is\r\nnow Colchester or Malden, authorities are divided, but Freeman says\r\nColchester). The canons framed at Arles on this occasion became the\r\nlaw of the British Church, and in this more favourable period for\r\nChristians the Christmas festival was kept with great rejoicing. But\r\nthis settled state of affairs was subsequently disturbed by the\r\ndeparture of the Romans and the several invasions of the Anglo-Saxons\r\nand the Danes which preceded the Norman Conquest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS AGAIN IN TROUBLOUS TIMES: THE DEPARTURE OF THE ROMANS AND\r\nTHE INVASION OF THE ANGLO-SAXONS.\r\n\r\nThe outgoing of the Romans and the incoming of the Angles, the Saxons,\r\nand the Jutes disastrously affected the festival of Christmas, for the\r\ninvaders were heathens, and Christianity was swept westward before\r\nthem. They had lived in a part of the Continent which had not been\r\nreached by Christianity nor classic culture, and they worshipped the\r\nfalse gods of Woden and Thunder, and were addicted to various\r\nheathenish practices, some of which now mingled with the festivities\r\nof Christmastide. Still, as these Angles came to stay and have given\r\ntheir name to our country, it may be well to note that they came over\r\nto Britain from the one country which is known to have borne the name\r\nof Angeln or the Engle-land, and which is now called Sleswick, a\r\ndistrict in the middle of that peninsula which parts the Baltic from\r\nthe North Sea or German Ocean. The Romans having become weakened\r\nthrough their conflicts with Germany and other nations, at the\r\nbeginning of the fifth century, the Emperor Honorius recalled the\r\nRoman legions from Britain, and this made it much easier for the\r\nAngles and Saxons (who had previously tried to get in) to come and\r\nremain in this country. Thus our Teuton forefathers came and conquered\r\nmuch the greater part of Britain, the Picts and Scots remaining in the\r\nnorth and the Welsh in the west of the island. It was their custom to\r\nkill or make slaves of all the people they could, and so completely\r\ndid they conquer that part of Britain in which they settled that they\r\nkept their own language and manners and their own heathenish religion,\r\nand destroyed or desecrated Christian churches which had been set up.\r\nHence Christian missionaries were required to convert our ancestral\r\nworshippers of Woden and Thunder, and a difficult business it was to\r\nChristianise such pagans, for they stuck to their false gods with the\r\nsame tenacity that the northern nations did.\r\n\r\nIn his poem of \"King Olaf's Christmas\" Longfellow refers to the\r\nworship of Thor and Odin alongside with the worship of Christ in the\r\nnorthern nations:--\r\n\r\n \"At Drontheim, Olaf the King\r\n  Heard the bells of Yule-tide ring,\r\n      As he sat in his banquet-hall.\r\n  Drinking the nut-brown ale,\r\n  With his bearded Berserks hale\r\n      And tall.\r\n\r\n  *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n  O'er his drinking horn, the sign\r\n  He made of the Cross divine\r\n      As he drank, and muttered his prayers;\r\n  But the Berserks evermore\r\n  Made the sign of the Hammer of Thor\r\n      Over theirs.\"\r\n\r\nIn England, too, Christ and Thor were worshipped side by side for at\r\nleast 150 years after the introduction of Christianity, for while some\r\nof the English accepted Christ as their true friend and Saviour, He\r\nwas not accepted by all the people. Indeed, the struggle against Him\r\nis still going on, but we anticipate the time when He shall be\r\nvictorious all along the line.\r\n\r\nThe Christmas festival was duly observed by the missionaries who came\r\nto the South of England from Rome, headed by Augustine, and in the\r\nnorthern parts of the country the Christian festivities were revived\r\nby the Celtic missionaries from Iona, under Aidan, the famous\r\nColumbian monk. At least half of England was covered by the Columbian\r\nmonks, whose great foundation upon the rocky island of Iona, in the\r\nHebrides, was the source of Christianity to Scotland. The ritual of\r\nthe Celtic differed from that of the Romish missionaries, and caused\r\nconfusion, till at the Synod of Whitby (664) the Northumbrian Kingdom\r\nadopted the Roman usages, and England obtained ecclesiastical unity as\r\na branch of the Church of Rome. Thus unity in the Church preceded by\r\nseveral centuries unity in the State.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUEEN BERTHA.]\r\n\r\nIn connection with Augustine's mission to England, a memorable story\r\n(recorded in Green's \"History of the English People\") tells how, when\r\nbut a young Roman deacon, Gregory had noted the white bodies, the fair\r\nfaces, the golden hair of some youths who stood bound in the\r\nmarket-place of Rome. \"From what country do these slaves come?\" he\r\nasked the traders who brought them. \"They are English, Angles!\" the\r\nslave-dealers answered. The deacon's pity veiled itself in poetic\r\nhumour. \"Not Angles, but Angels,\" he said, \"with faces so angel-like!\r\nFrom what country come they?\" \"They come,\" said the merchants, \"from\r\nDeira.\" \"De ira!\" was the untranslatable reply; \"aye, plucked from\r\nGod's ire, and called to Christ's mercy! And what is the name of their\r\nking?\" \"AElla,\" they told him, and Gregory seized on the words as of\r\ngood omen. \"Alleluia shall be sung in AElla's land!\" he cried, and\r\npassed on, musing how the angel-faces should be brought to sing it.\r\nOnly three or four years had gone by when the deacon had become Bishop\r\nof Rome, and the marriage of Bertha, daughter of the Frankish king,\r\nCharibert of Paris, with AEthelberht, King of Kent, gave him the\r\nopening he sought; for Bertha, like her Frankish kinsfolk, was a\r\nChristian.\r\n\r\nAnd so, after negotiations with the rulers of Gaul, Gregory sent\r\nAugustine, at the head of a band of monks, to preach the gospel to the\r\nEnglish people. The missionaries landed in 597, on the very spot where\r\nHengest had landed more than a century before, in the Isle of Thanet;\r\nand the king received them sitting in the open air on the chalk-down\r\nabove Minster, where the eye nowadays catches, miles away over the\r\nmarshes, the dim tower of Canterbury. Rowbotham, in his \"History of\r\nMusic,\" says that wherever Gregory sent missionaries he also sent\r\ncopies of the Gregorian song as he had arranged it in his\r\n\"Antiphonary.\" And he bade them go singing among the people. And\r\nAugustine entered Kent bearing a silver cross and a banner with the\r\nimage of Christ painted on it, while a long train of choristers walked\r\nbehind him chanting the _Kyrie Eleison_. In this way they came to the\r\ncourt of AEthelberht, who assigned them Canterbury as an abode; and\r\nthey entered Canterbury with similar pomp, and as they passed through\r\nthe gates they sang this petition: \"Lord, we beseech Thee to keep Thy\r\nwrath away from this city and from Thy holy Church, Alleluia!\"\r\n\r\nAs papal Rome preserved many relics of heathen Rome, so, in like\r\nmanner, Pope Gregory, in sending Augustine over to convert the\r\nAnglo-Saxons, directed him to accommodate the ceremonies of the\r\nChristian worship as much as possible to those of the heathen, that\r\nthe people might not be much startled at the change; and, in\r\nparticular, he advised him to allow converts to kill and eat at the\r\nChristmas festival a great number of oxen to the glory of God, as they\r\nhad formerly done to the honour of the devil. The clergy, therefore,\r\nendeavoured to connect the remnants of Pagan idolatry with\r\nChristianity, and also allowed some of the practices of our British\r\nancestors to mingle in the festivities of Christmastide. The religion\r\nof the Druids, the priests of the ancient Britons, is supposed to have\r\nbeen somewhat similar to that of the Brahmins of India, the Magi of\r\nPersia, and the Chaldeans of Syria. They worshipped in groves,\r\nregarded the oak and mistletoe as objects of veneration, and offered\r\nsacrifices. Before Christianity came to Britain December was called\r\n\"Aerra Geola,\" because the sun then \"turns his glorious course.\" And\r\nunder different names, such as Woden (another form of Odin), Thor,\r\nThunder, Saturn, &c., the pagans held their festivals of rejoicing at\r\nthe winter solstice; and so many of the ancient customs connected with\r\nthese festivals were modified and made subservient to Christianity.\r\n\r\nSome of the English even tried to serve Christ and the older gods\r\ntogether, like the Roman Emperor, Alexander Severus, whose chapel\r\ncontained Orpheus side by side with Abraham and Christ. \"Roedwald of\r\nEast Anglia resolved to serve Christ and the older gods together, and\r\na pagan and a Christian altar fronted one another in the same royal\r\ntemple.\"[5] Kent, however, seems to have been evangelised rapidly, for\r\nit is recorded that on Christmas Day, 597, no less than ten thousand\r\npersons were baptized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBefore his death Augustine was able to see almost the whole of Kent\r\nand Essex nominally Christian.\r\n\r\nChristmas was now celebrated as the principal festival of the year,\r\nfor our Anglo-Saxon forefathers delighted in the festivities of the\r\nHalig-Monath (holy month), as they called the month of December, in\r\nallusion to Christmas Day. At the great festival of Christmas the\r\nmeetings of the Witenagemot were held, as well as at Easter and\r\nWhitsuntide, wherever the Court happened to be. And at these times the\r\nAnglo-Saxon, and afterwards the Danish, Kings of England lived in\r\nstate, wore their crowns, and were surrounded by all the great men of\r\ntheir kingdoms (together with strangers of rank) who were sumptuously\r\nentertained, and the most important affairs of state were brought\r\nunder consideration. There was also an outflow of generous hospitality\r\ntowards the poor, who had a hard time of it during the rest of the\r\nyear, and who required the Christmas gifts to provide them with such\r\ncreature comforts as would help them through the inclement season of\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\nReaders of Saxon history will remember that chieftains in the festive\r\nhall are alluded to in the comparison made by one of King Edwin's\r\nchiefs, in discussing the welcome to be given to the Christian\r\nmissionary Paulinus: \"The present life of man, O King, seems to me, in\r\ncomparison of that time which is unknown to us, like to the swift\r\nflight of a sparrow through the hall where you sit at your meal in\r\nwinter, with your chiefs and attendants, warmed by a fire made in the\r\nmiddle of the hall, while storms of rain or snow prevail without.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ANCIENT FIREPLACE.]\r\n\r\nThe \"hall\" was the principal part of a gentleman's house in Saxon\r\ntimes--the place of entertainment and hospitality--and at\r\nChristmastide the doors were never shut against any who appeared to be\r\nworthy of welcome. And with such modes of travelling as were in vogue\r\nin those days one can readily understand that, not only at Christmas,\r\nbut also at other seasons, the rule of hospitality to strangers was a\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\nTo this period belong the princely pageants and the magnificent\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS ENTERTAINMENTS OF KING ARTHUR\r\n\r\nand the Knights of his Round Table. We know that some people are\r\ninclined to discredit the accounts which have come down to us of this\r\nfamous British King and Christian hero, but for our own part we are\r\ninclined to trust the old chroniclers, at all events so far as to\r\nbelieve that they give us true pictures\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRAVELLING IN THE OLDEN TIME, WITH A \"CHRISTMAS FOOL\"\r\nON THE FRONT SEAT.]\r\n\r\nof the manners and customs of the times of which they write; and in\r\nthis prosaic age it may surely be permitted to us at Christmastide to\r\nlinger over the doings of those romantic days,\r\n\r\n  \"When every morning brought a noble chance,\r\n   And every chance brought out a noble knight.\"[6]\r\n\r\nSir John Froissart tells us of the princely pageants which King Arthur\r\nheld at Windsor in the sixth century, and of the sumptuous Christmas\r\nbanquetings at his Round Table--the very Round Table (so we are to\r\nbelieve, on the authority of Dr. Milner)[7] which has been preserved\r\nin the old chapel, now termed the county hall, at Winchester. It\r\nconsists of stout oak plank, perforated with many bullets, supposed to\r\nhave been shot by Cromwell's soldiers. It is painted with a figure to\r\nrepresent King Arthur, and with the names of his twenty-four knights\r\nas they are stated in the romances of the old chroniclers. This famous\r\nPrince, who instituted the military order of the Knights of the Round\r\nTable, is also credited with the reintroduction of Christianity at\r\nYork after the Saxon invaders had destroyed the first churches built\r\nthere. He was unwearying in his warfare against enemies of the\r\nreligion of Christ. His first great enterprise was the siege of a\r\nSaxon army at York, and, having afterwards won brilliant victories in\r\nSomersetshire and other parts of southern England, he again marched\r\nnorthward and penetrated Scotland to attack the Picts and Scots, who\r\nhad long harassed the border. On returning from Scotland, Arthur\r\nrested his wearied army at York and kept Christmas with great\r\nbountifulness. Geoffrey of Monmouth says he was a prince of\r\n\"unparalleled courage and generosity,\" and his Christmas at York was\r\nkept with the greatest joy and festivity. Then was the round table\r\nfilled with jocund guests, and the minstrels, gleemen, harpers,\r\npipe-players, jugglers, and dancers were as happy round about their\r\nlog-fires as if they had shone in the blaze of a thousand gas-lights.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WILD BOAR HUNT: KILLING THE BOAR.]\r\n\r\nKing Arthur and his Knights also indulged in out-door amusements, as\r\nhunting, hawking, running, leaping, wrestling, jousts, and tourneys.\r\n\"So,\" says Sir Thomas Malory,[8] \"passed forth all the winter with all\r\nmanner of hunting and hawking, and jousts and tourneys were many\r\nbetween many great lords. And ever, in all manner of places, Sir\r\nLavaine got great worship, that he was nobly renowned among many of\r\nthe knights of the Round Table. Thus it passed on until Christmas, and\r\nevery day there were jousts made for a diamond, that whosoever joust\r\nbest should have a diamond. But Sir Launcelot would not joust, but if\r\nit were a great joust cried; but Sir Lavaine jousted there all the\r\nChristmas passing well, and most was praised; for there were few that\r\ndid so well as he; wherefore all manner of knights deemed that Sir\r\nLavaine should be made a Knight of the Round Table, at the next high\r\nfeast of Pentecost.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANGLO-SAXON EXCESSES\r\n\r\nare referred to by some of the old chroniclers, intemperance being a\r\nvery prevalent vice at the Christmas festival. Ale and mead were their\r\nfavourite drinks; wines were used as occasional luxuries. \"When all\r\nwere satisfied with dinner,\" says an old chronicler, \"and their tables\r\nwere removed, they continued drinking till the evening.\" And another\r\ntells how drinking and gaming went on through the greater part of the\r\nnight. Chaucer's one solitary reference to Christmastide is an\r\nallegorical representation of the jovial feasting which was the\r\ncharacteristic feature of this great festival held in \"the colde\r\nfrosty season of December.\"\r\n\r\n \"Janus sits by the fire with double beard,\r\n  And drinketh of his bugle horn the wine:\r\n  Before him stands the brawn of tusked swine,\r\n  And 'Nowel' cryeth every lusty man.\"[9]\r\n\r\nThe Saxons were strongly attached to field sports, and as the \"brawn\r\nof the tusked swine\" was the first Christmas dish, it was provided by\r\nthe pleasant preliminary pastime of hunting the wild boar; and the\r\nincidents of the chase afforded interesting table talk when the boar's\r\nhead was brought in ceremoniously to the Christmas festival.\r\n\r\nProminent among the Anglo-Saxon amusements of Christmastide, Strutt\r\nmentions their propensity for gaming with dice, as derived from their\r\nancestors, for Tacitus assures us that the ancient Germans would not\r\nonly hazard all their wealth, but even stake their liberty, upon the\r\nturn of the dice: \"and he who loses submits to servitude, though\r\nyounger and stronger than his antagonist, and patiently permits\r\nhimself to be bound and sold in the market; and this madness they\r\ndignify by the name of honour.\" Chess and backgammon were also\r\nfavourite games with the Anglo-Saxons, and a large portion of the\r\nnight was appropriated to the pursuit of these sedentary amusements,\r\nespecially at the Christmas season of the year, when the early\r\ndarkness stopped out-door games.\r\n\r\n \"When they had dined, as I can you say,\r\n  Lords and ladies went to play;\r\n  Some to tables, and some to chess,\r\n  With other games more and less.\"[10]\r\n\r\nOur Saxon forefathers were very superstitious. They had many\r\npretenders to witchcraft. They believed in the powers of philtres and\r\nspells, and invocated spirits; and they relished a blood-curdling\r\nghost story at Christmas quite as much as their twentieth-century\r\ndescendants. They confided in prognostics, and believed in the\r\ninfluence of particular times and seasons; and at Christmastide they\r\nderived peculiar pleasure from their belief in the immunity of the\r\nseason from malign influences--a belief which descended to Elizabethan\r\ndays, and is referred to by Shakespeare, in \"Hamlet\":--\r\n\r\n \"Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes,\r\n  Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,\r\n  The bird of dawning singeth all night long:\r\n  And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;\r\n  The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,\r\n  No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,\r\n  So hallowed and so gracious is the time.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADORATION OF THE MAGI\r\nOLD GLASS WINCHESTER CATHEDRAL]\r\n\r\nWe cannot pass over this period without mentioning a great Christmas\r\nin the history of our Teutonic kinsmen on the Continent, for the\r\nSaxons of England and those of Germany have the same Teutonic origin.\r\nWe refer to\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CROWNING OF CHARLEMAGNE EMPEROR OF THE ROMANS ON CHRISTMAS DAY.\r\n\r\nThe coronation took place at Rome, on Christmas Day, in the year 800.\r\nFreeman[11] says that when Charles was King of the Franks and Lombards\r\nand Patrician of the Romans, he was on very friendly terms with the\r\nmighty Offa, King of the Angles that dwelt in Mercia. Charles and Offa\r\nnot only exchanged letters and gifts, but each gave the subjects of\r\nthe other various rights in his dominions, and they made a league\r\ntogether, \"for that they two were the mightiest of all the kings that\r\ndwelt in the Western lands.\" As conqueror of the old Saxons in\r\nGermany, Charles may be regarded as the first King of all Germany, and\r\nhe was the first man of any Teutonic nation who was called Roman\r\nEmperor. He was crowned with the diadem of the Caesars, by Pope Leo, in\r\nthe name of Charles Augustus, Emperor of the Romans. And it was held\r\nfor a thousand years after, down to the year 1806, that the King of\r\nthe Franks, or, as he was afterwards called, the King of Germany, had\r\na right to be crowned by the Pope of Rome, and to be called Emperor of\r\nthe Romans. In the year 1806, however, the Emperor Francis the Second,\r\nwho was also King of Hungary and Archduke of Austria, resigned the\r\nRoman Empire and the Kingdom of Germany. Since that time no Emperor of\r\nthe Romans has been chosen; but a new German Emperor has been created,\r\nand the event may be regarded as one of Christmastide, for the\r\nvictorious soldiers who brought it about spent their Christmas in the\r\nFrench capital, and during the festival arranged for the\r\nre-establishment of the German Empire. So it happens, that while\r\nreferring to the crowning of the first German Emperor of the Roman\r\nEmpire, on Christmas Day, 800, we are able to record that more than a\r\nthousand years afterwards the unification of the German Empire and the\r\ncreation of its first Emperor also occurred at Christmastide, under\r\nthe influence of the German triumphs over the French in the war of\r\n1870. The imposing event was resolved upon by the German Princes on\r\nDecember 18, 1870, the preliminaries were completed during the\r\nChristmas festival, and on January 18, 1871, in the Galerie des Glaces\r\nof the chateau of Versailles, William, King of Prussia, was crowned\r\nand proclaimed first Emperor of the new German Empire.\r\n\r\nNow, going back again over a millennium, we come to\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS IN THE TIME OF ALFRED THE GREAT.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Alfred the Great a law was passed with relation to\r\nholidays, by virtue of which the twelve days after the Nativity of our\r\nSaviour were set apart for the celebration of the Christmas festival.\r\nSome writers are of opinion that, but for Alfred's strict observance\r\nof the \"full twelve holy days,\" he would not have been defeated by the\r\nDanes in the year 878. It was just after Twelfth-night that the Danish\r\nhost came suddenly--\"bestole,\" as the old Chronicle says--to\r\nChippenham. Then \"they rode through the West Saxons' land, and there\r\nsat down, and mickle of the folk over sea they drove, and of others\r\nthe most deal they rode over; all but the King Alfred; he with a\r\nlittle band hardly fared after the woods and on the moor-fastnesses.\"\r\nBut whether or not Alfred's preparations for the battle just referred\r\nto were hindered by his enjoyment of the festivities of Christmastide\r\nwith his subjects, it is quite certain that the King won the hearts of\r\nhis people by the great interest he took in their welfare. This good\r\nking--whose intimacy with his people we delight to associate with the\r\nhomely incident of the burning of a cottager's cakes--kept the\r\nChristmas festival quite as heartily as any of the early English\r\nkings, but not so boisterously as some of them. Of the many beautiful\r\nstories told about him, one might very well belong to Christmastide.\r\nIt is said that, wishing to know what the Danes were about, and how\r\nstrong they were, King Alfred one day set out from Athelney in the\r\ndisguise of a Christmas minstrel, and went into the Danish camp, and\r\nstayed there several days, amusing the Danes with his playing, till he\r\nhad seen all he wanted, and then went back without any one finding him\r\nout.\r\n\r\nNow, passing on to\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS UNDER THE DANISH KINGS OF ENGLAND,\r\n\r\nwe find that in 961 King Edgar celebrated the Christmas\r\nfestival with great splendour at York; and in 1013 Ethelred\r\nkept his Christmas with the brave citizens of London who had\r\ndefended the capital during a siege and stoutly resisted Swegen,\r\nthe tyrant king of the Danes. Sir Walter Scott, in his beautiful\r\npoem of \"Marmion,\" thus pictures the \"savage Dane\" keeping\r\nthe great winter festival:--\r\n\r\n \"Even, heathen yet, the savage Dane\r\n  At Iol more deep the mead did drain;\r\n  High on the beach his galleys drew,\r\n  And feasted all his pirate crew;\r\n  Then in his low and pine-built hall,\r\n  Where shields and axes deck'd the wall,\r\n  They gorged upon the half-dress'd steer;\r\n  Caroused in seas of sable beer;\r\n  While round, in brutal jest, were thrown\r\n  The half-gnaw'd rib, and marrow bone:\r\n  Or listen'd all, in grim delight.\r\n  While Scalds yell'd out the joys of fight.\r\n  Then forth, in frenzy, would they hie,\r\n  While wildly-loose their red locks fly,\r\n  And dancing round the blazing pile,\r\n  They make such barbarous mirth the while,\r\n  As best might to the mind recall\r\n  The boisterous joys of Odin's hall.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the citizens of London saw that Swegen had succeeded all over\r\nEngland except their own city, they thought it was no use holding out\r\nany longer, and they too, submitted and gave hostages. And so Swegen\r\nwas the first Dane who was king, or (as Florence calls him) \"Tyrant\r\nover all England;\" and Ethelred, sometimes called the \"Unready,\" King\r\nof the West Saxons, who had struggled unsuccessfully against the\r\nDanes, fled with his wife and children to his brother-in-law's court\r\nin Normandy. On the death of Swegen, the Danes of his fleet chose his\r\nson Cnut to be King, but the English invited Ethelred to return from\r\nNormandy and renew the struggle with the Danes. He did so, and the\r\nAnglo-Saxon Chronicle says: \"He held his kingdom with great toil and\r\ngreat difficulty the while that his life lasted.\" After his death and\r\nthat of his son Edmund, Cnut was finally elected and crowned.\r\nFreeman,[12] in recording the event, says that: \"At the Christmas of\r\n1016-1017, Cnut was a third time chosen king over all England, and one\r\nof the first things that he did was to send to Normandy for the\r\nwidowed Lady Emma, though she was many years older than he was. She\r\ncame over; she married the new king; and was again Lady of the\r\nEnglish. She bore Cnut two children, Harthacnut and Gunhild. Her three\r\nchildren by Ethelred were left in Normandy. She seems not to have\r\ncared at all for them or for the memory of Ethelred; her whole love\r\npassed to her new husband and her new children. Thus it came about\r\nthat the children of Ethelred were brought up in Normandy, and had the\r\nfeelings of Normans rather than Englishmen, a thing which again\r\ngreatly helped the Norman Conquest.\"\r\n\r\nCnut's first acts of government in England were a series of murders;\r\nbut he afterwards became a wise and temperate king. He even identified\r\nhimself with the patriotism which had withstood the stranger. He\r\njoined heartily in the festivities of Christmastide, and atoned for\r\nhis father's ravages by costly gifts to the religious houses. And his\r\nlove for monks broke out in the song which he composed as he listened\r\nto their chant at Ely: \"Merrily sang the monks in Ely when Cnut King\r\nrowed by\" across the vast fen-waters that surrounded their Abbey.\r\n\"Row, boatmen, near the land, and hear we these monks sing.\"[13]\r\n\r\n \"'All hail!' the monks at Christmas sang;\r\n  The merry monks who kept with cheer\r\n  The gladdest day of all the year.\"[14]\r\n\r\nIt is said that Cnut, who is also called Canute, \"marked one of his\r\nroyal Christmases by a piece of sudden retributive justice: bored\r\nbeyond all endurance by the Saxon Edric's iteration of the traitorous\r\nservices he had rendered him, the King exclaimed to Edric, Earl of\r\nNorthumberland: 'Then let him receive his deserts, that he may not\r\nbetray us as he betrayed Ethelred and Edmund!' upon which the ready\r\nNorwegian disposed of all fear on that score by cutting down the\r\nboaster with his axe, and throwing his body into the Thames.\"[15]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1035, King Cnut died at Shaftesbury, and was buried in\r\nWinchester Cathedral. His sons, Harold and Harthacnut, did not possess\r\nthe capacity for good government, otherwise the reign of the Danes\r\nmight have continued. As it was, their reigns, though short, were\r\ntroublesome. Harold died at Oxford in 1040, and was buried at\r\nWestminster (being the first king who was buried there); Harthacnut\r\ndied at Lambeth at a wedding-feast in 1042, and was buried beside his\r\nfather in Winchester Cathedral. And thus ended the reigns of the\r\nDanish kings of England.\r\n\r\nNow we come to\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF EDWARD THE CONFESSOR,\r\n\r\nwho, we are told, was heartily chosen by all the people, for the two\r\nvery good reasons, that he was an Englishman by birth, and the only\r\nman of either the English or the Danish royal families who was at\r\nhand. He was the son of Ethelred and Emma, and at the Christmas\r\nfestival of his coronation there was great rejoicing. As his early\r\ntraining had been at the court of his uncle, Richard the Good, in\r\nNormandy, he had learnt to prefer Norman-French customs and life to\r\nthose of the English. During his reign, therefore, he brought over\r\nmany strangers and appointed them to high ecclesiastical and other\r\noffices, and Norman influence and refinement of manners gradually\r\nincreased at the English court, and this, of course, led to the more\r\nstately celebration of the Christmas festival. The King himself, being\r\nof a pious and meditative disposition, naturally took more interest in\r\nthe religious than the temporal rejoicings, and the administration of\r\nstate affairs was left almost entirely to members of the house of\r\nGodwin during the principal part of his reign. Many disturbances\r\noccurred during Edward's reign in different parts of the country,\r\nespecially on the Welsh border. At the Christmas meeting of the King\r\nand his Wise Men, at Gloucester, in 1053, it was ordered that Rhys,\r\nthe brother of Gruffydd, the South Welsh king, be put to death for his\r\ngreat plunder and mischief. The same year, the great Earl Godwine,\r\nwhile dining with the king at Winchester at the Easter feast, suddenly\r\nfell in a fit, died four days after, and was buried in the old\r\ncathedral. A few years later (1065), the Northumbrians complained that\r\nEarl Tostig, Harold's brother, had caused Gospatric, one of the chief\r\nThanes, to be treacherously murdered when he came to the King's court\r\nthe Christmas before. King Edward kept his last Christmas (1065), and\r\nhad the meeting of his Wise Men in London instead of Gloucester as\r\nusual. His great object was to finish his new church at Westminster,\r\nand to have it hallowed before he died. He lived just long enough to\r\nhave this done. On Innocent's Day the new Minster was consecrated, but\r\nthe King was too ill to be there, so the Lady Edith stood in his\r\nstead. And on January 5, 1066, King Edward, the son of Ethelred, died.\r\nOn the morning of the day following his death, the body of the\r\nConfessor was laid in the tomb, in his new church; and on the same\r\nday--\r\n\r\n\r\nHAROLD WAS CROWNED KING\r\n\r\nin his stead. Thus three very important events--the consecration of\r\nWestminster Abbey, the death of Edward the Confessor, and the crowning\r\nof Harold--all occurred during the same Christmas festival.\r\n\r\nIn the terrible year 1066 England had three kings. The reign of\r\nHarold, the son of Godwine, who succeeded Edward the Confessor,\r\nterminated at the battle of Senlac, or Hastings, and on the following\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS DAY WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR WAS CROWNED KING\r\n\r\nby Archbishop Ealdred. He had not at that time conquered all the land,\r\nand it was a long while before he really possessed the whole of it.\r\nStill, he was the king, chosen, crowned, and anointed, and no one ever\r\nwas able to drive him out of the land, and the crown of England has\r\never since been held by his descendants.\r\n\r\n    [5] Green's \"History of the English People.\"\r\n\r\n    [6] Tennyson.\r\n\r\n    [7] \"History of Winchester.\"\r\n\r\n    [8] \"History of King Arthur and His Noble Knights.\"\r\n\r\n    [9] \"The Franklin's Tale.\"\r\n\r\n    [10] \"Romance of Ipomydon.\"\r\n\r\n    [11] \"Old English History.\"\r\n\r\n    [12] \"Short History of the Norman Conquest.\"\r\n\r\n    [13] \"History of the English People.\"\r\n\r\n    [14] J.

They \"loved to display\r\ntheir magnificence, not in huge piles of food and hogsheads of strong\r\ndrink, but in large and stately edifices, rich armour, gallant horses,\r\nchoice falcons, well-ordered tournaments, banquets delicate rather\r\nthan abundant, and wines remarkable rather for their exquisite flavour\r\nthan for their intoxicating power.\" Quite so. But even the Normans\r\nwere not all temperate. And, while it is quite true that the refined\r\nmanners and chivalrous spirit of the Normans exercised a powerful\r\ninfluence on the Anglo-Saxons, it is equally true that the conquerors\r\non mingling with the English people adopted many of the ancient\r\ncustoms to which they tenaciously clung, and these included the\r\ncustoms of Christmastide.\r\n\r\nThe Norman kings and nobles displayed their taste for magnificence in\r\nthe most remarkable manner at their coronations, tournaments, and\r\ntheir celebrations of Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide. The great\r\ncouncils of the Norman reigns which assembled at Christmas and the\r\nother great festivals, were in appearance a continuation of the\r\nWitenagemots, but the power of the barons became very formal in the\r\npresence of such despotic monarchs as William the Conqueror and his\r\nsons. At the Christmas festival all the prelates and nobles of the\r\nkingdom were, by their tenures, obliged to attend their sovereign to\r\nassist in the administration of justice and in deliberation on the\r\ngreat affairs of the kingdom. On these occasions the King wore his\r\ncrown, and feasted his nobles in the great hall of his palace, and\r\nmade them presents as marks of his royal favour, after which they\r\nproceeded to the consideration of State affairs. Wherever the Court\r\nhappened to be, there was usually a large assemblage of gleemen, who\r\nwere jugglers and pantomimists as well as minstrels, and were\r\naccustomed to associate themselves in companies, and amuse the\r\nspectators with feats of strength and agility, dancing, tumbling, and\r\nsleight-of-hand tricks, as well as musical performances. Among the\r\nminstrels who came into England with William the Conqueror was one\r\nnamed Taillefer, who was present at the battle of Hastings, and rode\r\nin front of the Norman army, inspiriting the soldiers by his songs. He\r\nsang of Roland, the heroic captain of Charlemagne, tossing his sword\r\nin the air and catching it again as he approached the English line. He\r\nwas the first to strike a blow at the English, but after mortally\r\nwounding one or two of King Harold's warriors, he was himself struck\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nAt the Christmas feast minstrels played on various musical instruments\r\nduring dinner, and sang or told tales afterwards, both in the hall and\r\nin the chamber to which the king and his nobles retired for amusement.\r\nThus it is written of a court minstrel:--\r\n\r\n \"Before the King he set him down\r\n  And took his harp of merry soun,\r\n  And, as he full well can,\r\n  Many merry notes he began.\r\n  The king beheld, and sat full still,\r\n  To hear his harping he had good will.\r\n  When he left off his harping,\r\n  To him said that rich king,\r\n  Minstrel, we liketh well thy glee,\r\n  What thing that thou ask of me\r\n  Largely I will thee pay;\r\n  Therefore ask now and asay.\" (_Sir Orpheo._)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLIND MINSTREL AT A FEAST.]\r\n\r\nAfter the Conquest the first entertainments given by William the\r\nConqueror were those to his victorious warriors:--\r\n\r\n \"Every warrior's manly neck\r\n  Chains of regal honour deck,\r\n  Wreathed in many a golden link:\r\n  From the golden cup they drink\r\n  Nectar that the bees produce,\r\n  Or the grape's extatic juice.\r\n  Flush'd with mirth and hope they burn.\"\r\n\r\n  _The Gododin._\r\n\r\nIn 1067 the Conqueror kept a grand Christmas in London. He had spent\r\neight months of that year rewarding his warriors and gratifying his\r\nsubjects in Normandy, where he had held a round of feasts and made a\r\ngrand display of the valuable booty which he had won by his sword. A\r\npart of his plunder he sent to the Pope along with the banner of\r\nHarold. Another portion, consisting of gold, golden vases, and richly\r\nembroidered stuffs, was distributed among the abbeys, monasteries, and\r\nchurches of his native duchy, \"neither monks nor priests remaining\r\nwithout a guerdon.\" After spending the greater part of the year in\r\nsplendid entertainments in Normandy, apparently undisturbed by the\r\nreports which had reached him of discontent and insurrection among his\r\nnew subjects in England, William at length embarked at Dieppe on the\r\n6th of December, 1067, and returned to London to celebrate the\r\napproaching festival of Christmas. With the object of quieting the\r\ndiscontent which prevailed, he invited a considerable number of the\r\nSaxon chiefs to take part in the Christmas festival, which was kept\r\nwith unusual splendour; and he also caused a proclamation to be read\r\nin all the churches of the capital declaring it to be his will that\r\n\"all the citizens of London should enjoy their national laws as in the\r\ndays of King Edward.\" But his policy of friendship and conciliation\r\nwas soon changed into one of cruelty and oppression.\r\n\r\nAt the instigation of Swein, the King of Denmark, who appeared in the\r\nHumber with a fleet, the people in the north of England and in some\r\nother parts rose in revolt against the rule of the Conqueror in 1068.\r\nSo skilfully had the revolt been planned that even William was taken\r\nby surprise. While he was hunting in the Forest of Dean he heard of\r\nthe loss of York and the slaughter of his garrison of 3,000 Normans,\r\nand resolved to avenge the disaster. Proceeding to the Humber with his\r\nhorsemen, by a heavy bribe he got the King of Denmark to withdraw his\r\nfleet; then, after some delay, spent in punishing revolters in the\r\nWelsh border, he attacked and took the city of York. The land in\r\nDurham and Northumberland was still quite unsubdued, and some of\r\nWilliam's soldiers had fared badly in their attempts to take\r\npossession. At the Christmas feast of 1068 William made a grant of the\r\nearldom of Northumberland to Robert of Comines, who set out with a\r\nNorman army to take possession. But he fared no better than his\r\npredecessors had done. The men of the land determined to withstand\r\nhim, but through the help of Bishop AEthelwine he entered Durham\r\npeaceably. But he let his men plunder, so the men of the city rose and\r\nslew him and his followers. And now, says Freeman,[16] William \"did\r\none of the most frightful deeds of his life. He caused all Northern\r\nEngland, beginning with Yorkshire, to be utterly laid waste, that its\r\npeople might not be able to fight against him any more. The havoc was\r\nfearful; men were starved or sold themselves as slaves, and the land\r\ndid not recover for many years. Then King William wore his crown and\r\nkept his Christmas at York\" (1069).\r\n\r\nNow the Conqueror set barons in different parts of the country, and\r\neach of them kept his own miniature court and celebrated Christmas\r\nafter the costly Norman style. In his beautiful poem of \"The Norman\r\nBaron\" Longfellow pictures one of these Christmas celebrations, and\r\ntells how--\r\n\r\n \"In the hall, the serf and vassal\r\n  Held, that night, their Christmas wassail;\r\n  Many a carol, old and saintly,\r\n      Sang the minstrels and the waits.\r\n\r\n  And so loud these Saxon gleemen\r\n  Sang to slaves the songs of freemen,\r\n  That the storm was heard but faintly\r\n      Knocking at the castle-gates.\r\n\r\n  Till at length the lays they chaunted\r\n  Reached the chamber terror-haunted,\r\n  Where the monk, with accents holy,\r\n      Whispered at the baron's ear.\r\n\r\n  Tears upon his eyelids glistened\r\n  As he paused awhile and listened,\r\n  And the dying baron slowly\r\n      Turned his weary head to hear.\r\n\r\n 'Wassail for the kingly stranger\r\n  Born and cradled in a manger!\r\n  King, like David, priest, like Aaron,\r\n      Christ is born to set us free!'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MINSTRELS' CHRISTMAS SERENADE AT AN OLD BARONIAL HALL.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Strutt, the popular sports and pastimes prevalent at the\r\nclose of the Saxon era were not subjected to any material change by\r\nthe coming of the Normans. But William and his immediate successors\r\nrestricted the privileges of the chase, and imposed great penalties on\r\nthose who presumed to destroy the game in the royal forests without a\r\nproper license. The wild boar and the wolf still afforded sport at the\r\nChristmas season, and there was an abundance of smaller game. Leaping,\r\nrunning, wrestling, the casting of darts, and other pastimes which\r\nrequired bodily strength and agility were also practised, and when the\r\nfrost set in various games were engaged in upon the ice. It is not\r\nknown at what time skating made its first appearance in England, but\r\nwe find some traces of such an exercise in the thirteenth century, at\r\nwhich period, according to Fitzstephen, it was customary in the\r\nwinter, when the ice would bear them, for the young citizens of London\r\nto fasten the leg bones of animals under the soles of their feet by\r\ntying them round their ankles; and then, taking a pole shod with iron\r\ninto their hands, they pushed themselves forward by striking it\r\nagainst the ice, and moved with celerity equal, says the author, to a\r\nbird flying through the air, or an arrow from a cross-bow; but some\r\nallowance, we presume, must be made for the poetical figure: he then\r\nadds, \"At times, two of them thus furnished agree to start opposite\r\none to another, at a great distance; they meet, elevate their poles,\r\nattack, and strike each other, when one or both of them fall, and not\r\nwithout some bodily hurt; and, even after their fall, are carried a\r\ngreat distance from each other, by the rapidity of the motion, and\r\nwhatever part of the head comes upon the ice it is sure to be laid\r\nbare.\"\r\n\r\nThe meetings of the King and his Wise Men for the consideration of\r\nstate affairs were continued at the great festivals, and that held at\r\nChristmas in 1085 is memorable on account of the resolution then\r\npassed to make the Domesday survey, in reference to which Freeman\r\nsays: \"One of the greatest acts of William's reign, and that by which\r\nwe come to know more about England in his time than from any other\r\nsource, was done in the assembly held at Gloucester at the Christmas\r\nof 1085. Then the King had, as the Chronicle says, 'very deep speech\r\nwith his Wise Men.' This 'deep speech' in English is in French\r\n_parlement_; and so we see how our assemblies came by their later\r\nname. And the end of the deep speech was that commissioners were sent\r\nthrough all England, save only the Bishopric of Durham and the earldom\r\nof Northumberland, to make a survey of the land. They were to set down\r\nby whom every piece of land, great and small, was held then, by whom\r\nit was held in King Edward's day, what it was worth now, and what it\r\nhad been worth in King Edward's day. All this was written in a book\r\nkept at Winchester, which men called _Domesday Book_. It is a most\r\nwonderful record, and tells us more of the state of England just at\r\nthat moment than we know of it for a long time before or after.\"\r\n\r\nThe Domesday Book was completed in 1086, and the following year\r\n(1087) William the Conqueror died, and his son, William Rufus,\r\nsucceeded him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WESTMINSTER HALL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CORONATION OF WILLIAM THE RED\r\n\r\ntook place at Westminster on September 26, 1087, Archbishop Lanfranc\r\nofficiating. The King kept his first Christmas sumptuously at\r\nWestminster, and, Freeman says, \"it seems to have been then that he\r\ngave back the earldom of Kent to his uncle, Bishop Odo.\" The character\r\nof the Royal Christmases degenerated during the reign of Rufus, whose\r\nlicentiousness fouled the festivities. In the latter part of his reign\r\nRufus reared the spacious hall at Westminster, where so many Royal\r\nChristmases were afterwards kept, and which Pope calls\r\n\r\n  \"Rufus's roaring hall.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a magnificent relic of the profuse hospitality of former times.\r\nRichard the Second heightened its walls and added its noble roof of\r\nBritish oak, which shows the excellence of the wood carving of that\r\nperiod. Although Sir Charles Barry has shortened the Hall of its\r\nformer proportions to fit it as a vestibule to the New Houses of\r\nParliament, it is still a noble and spacious building, and one cannot\r\nwalk through it without in imagination recalling some of the Royal\r\nChristmases and other stately scenes which have been witnessed there.\r\nThe last of these festal glories was the coronation of George the\r\nFourth, which took place in 1821. This grand old hall at Westminster\r\nwas the theatre of Rufus's feasting and revelry; but, vast as the\r\nedifice then was, it did not equal the ideas of the extravagant\r\nmonarch. An old chronicler states that one of the King's courtiers,\r\nhaving observed that the building was too large for the purposes of\r\nits construction, Rufus replied, \"This halle is not begge enough by\r\none half, and is but a bedchamber in comparison of that I mind to\r\nmake.\" Yet this hall was for centuries the largest of its kind in\r\nEurope, and in it the Christmas feasts were magnificently kept.\r\n\r\nAfter a reign of thirteen years the vicious life of William Rufus met\r\nwith a tragical close. His dead body was found by peasants in a glade\r\nof the New Forest with the arrow either of a hunter or an assassin in\r\nhis breast. Sir Walter Tyrrel, a Norman knight, who had been hunting\r\nwith the king just before his death, fled to Normandy immediately\r\nafterwards, and was suspected of being a regicide. The body of Rufus\r\nwas buried in Winchester Cathedral.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS IN THE REIGN OF HENRY I.\r\n\r\nHenry the First's Christmas festival at Windsor, in 1126, was a\r\nmemorable one. In that year Henry's daughter Matilda became a widow by\r\nthe death of her husband, Henry V. of Germany, and King Henry\r\ndetermined to appoint her his successor to the throne of England and\r\nthe Dukedom of Normandy. On Christmas Day, 1126, a general assembly of\r\nthe nobles and higher ecclesiastics of the kingdom was held at Windsor\r\nfor the purpose of declaring the Empress Matilda (as she was still\r\ncalled) the legitimate successor of Henry I., and the clergy and\r\nNorman barons of both countries swore allegiance to her in the event\r\nof the king's death. This appointment of Matilda was made by Henry in\r\nconsequence of the calamity which occurred just before Christmas, in\r\n1120, when he lost his much-loved son, Prince William--the only male\r\nlegitimate issue of Henry--through the wreck of _La Blanche Nef_ (the\r\nWhite Ship). On board the vessel were Prince William, his half-brother\r\nRichard, and Henry's natural daughter the Countess of Perche, as well\r\nas about a hundred and forty young noblemen of the most distinguished\r\nfamilies in England and Normandy, all of whom were lost in their\r\npassage home, only a few hours after the safe arrival of the king in\r\nEngland. Henry is said to have swooned at the intelligence, and was\r\nnever afterwards seen to smile. He had returned home anticipating a\r\njoyous Christmas festival, a season of glad tidings, but he was\r\nclosely followed by this sad news of the death of the heir apparent.\r\nThe incident has called forth one of the most beautiful poems of Mrs.\r\nHemans, from which we quote two verses:--\r\n\r\n \"The bark that held a prince went down,\r\n    The sweeping waves rolled on;\r\n  And what was England's glorious crown\r\n    To him that wept a son?\r\n  He lived--for life may long be borne,\r\n    Ere sorrow break its chain:\r\n  Why comes not death to those who mourn?\r\n    He never smiled again!\r\n\r\n  *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n  He sat where festal bowls went round,\r\n    He heard the minstrel sing;\r\n  He saw the tourney's victor crowned,\r\n    Amidst the kingly ring;\r\n  A murmur of the restless deep\r\n    Was blent with every strain,\r\n  A voice of winds that would not sleep,--\r\n    He never smiled again!\"\r\n\r\nIn 1127 Henry invited the king of the Scots to Windsor to join in the\r\nroyal celebration of Christmas, but the festivities were marred by an\r\nunseemly quarrel between the two primates. Thurstan, Archbishop of\r\nYork, encroaching upon the privileges of his brother of Canterbury\r\n(William de Corbeuil), insisted upon placing the crown upon the king's\r\nhead ere he set out for church. This the partisans of Canterbury would\r\nnot allow, settling the matter by turning Thurstan's chaplain and\r\nfollowers out of doors, and thereby causing such strife between the\r\nheads of the Church that they both set off to Rome to lay their\r\ngrievances before the Pope. And, subsequently, appeals to Rome became\r\nfrequent, until a satisfactory adjustment of the powers and privileges\r\nof the two archbishops was arrived at. The Archbishop of Canterbury\r\nwas acknowledged Primate of all England and Metropolitan; but, while\r\nthe privilege of crowning the sovereign was reserved for the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, that of crowning the Queen Consort was given\r\nto the Archbishop of York.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRANGE OLD STORIES OF CHRISTMASTIDE.\r\n\r\nThe progress of literature under the Conqueror and his sons was very\r\ngreat, many devoting themselves almost entirely to literary pursuits.\r\nLanfranc and Anselm, the Archbishops of Canterbury, had proved\r\nthemselves worthy of their exalted station. Their precepts and\r\nexamples had awakened the clergy and kindled an ardour for learning\r\nunknown in any preceding age. Nor did this enthusiasm perish with its\r\nauthors: it was kept alive by the honours which were lavished on all\r\nwho could boast of literary acquirements. During the reign of Henry I.\r\nGeoffrey of Monmouth published his History of the Britons, and William\r\nof Malmesbury assures us that every poet hastened to the court of\r\nHenry's Queen Matilda, at Westminster, to read his verses to the Queen\r\nand partake of her bounty. William of Malmesbury carefully collected\r\nthe lighter ballads which embodied the popular traditions of the\r\nEnglish kings, and he tells an amusing story which is connected with\r\nthe festival of Christmas. In early times dancing developed into a\r\nsort of passion, men and women continually dancing and singing\r\ntogether, holding one another by the hands, and concluding the dances\r\nwith kisses. These levities were at first encouraged by the Church,\r\nbut afterwards, seeing the abuse of them, the priests were compelled\r\nto reprimand and restrain the people. And the story told by William of\r\nMalmesbury describes the singular punishment which came upon some\r\nyoung men and women for disturbing a priest who was performing mass on\r\nthe eve of Christmas. \"I, Othbert, a sinner,\" says the story, \"have\r\nlived to tell the tale. It was the vigil of the Blessed Virgin, and in\r\na town where was a church of St. Magnus. And the priest, Rathbertus,\r\nhad just begun the mass, and I, with my comrades, fifteen young women\r\nand seventeen young men, were dancing outside the church. And we were\r\nsinging so loud that our songs were distinctly heard inside the\r\nbuilding, and interrupted the service of the mass. And the priest came\r\nout and told us to desist; and when we did not, he prayed God and St.\r\nMagnus that we might dance as our punishment for a year to come. A\r\nyouth, whose sister was dancing with us, seized her by the arm to drag\r\nher away, but it came off in his hand, and she danced on. For a whole\r\nyear we continued. No rain fell on us; cold, nor heat, nor hunger, nor\r\nthirst, nor fatigue affected us; neither our shoes nor our clothes\r\nwore out; but still we went on dancing. We trod the earth down to our\r\nknees, next to our middles, and at last were dancing in a pit. At the\r\nend of the year release came.\"\r\n\r\nGiraldus Cambrensis, amongst many ridiculous Christmas stories of\r\nmiracles, visions, and apparitions, tells of one devil who acted a\r\nconsiderable time as a gentleman's butler with great prudence and\r\nprobity; and of another who was a very diligent and learned clergyman,\r\nand a mighty favourite of his archbishop. This last clerical devil\r\nwas, it seems, an excellent historian, and used to divert the\r\nArchbishop with telling him old stories, some of which referred to the\r\nincarnation of our Saviour, and were related at the Christmas season.\r\n\"Before the incarnation of our Saviour,\" said the Archbishop's\r\nhistorian, \"the devils had great power over mankind, but after that\r\nevent their power was much diminished and they were obliged to fly.\r\nSome of them threw themselves into the sea; some concealed themselves\r\nin hollow trees, or in the clefts of rocks; and I myself plunged into\r\na certain fountain. As soon as he had said this, finding that he had\r\ndiscovered his secret, his face was covered with blushes, he went out\r\nof the room, and was no more seen.\"\r\n\r\nThe following cut (taken from MS. Harl., No. 4751, of the end of the\r\ntwelfth century) represents an elephant, with its castle and armed\r\nmen, engaged in battle. The bestiaries relate many strange things of\r\nthe elephant. They say that, though so large and powerful, and so\r\ncourageous against larger animals, it is afraid of a mouse; that its\r\nnature is so cold that it will never seek the company of the female\r\nuntil, wandering in the direction of Paradise, it meets with the plant\r\ncalled the mandrake, and eats of it, and that each female bears but\r\none young one in her life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAbsurd as we consider such stories, they were believed by the Normans,\r\nwho were no less credulous than the Anglo-Saxons. This is evident\r\nfrom the large number of miracles, revelations, visions, and\r\nenchantments which are related with great gravity by the old\r\nchroniclers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MISRULE OF KING STEPHEN.\r\n\r\nStephen of Blois was crowned at Westminster Abbey during the Christmas\r\nfestival (December 26, 1135). As a King of Misrule, he was fitly\r\ncrowned at Christmastide, and it would have been a good thing for the\r\nnation if his reign had been of the ephemeral character which was\r\ncustomary to Lords of Misrule. The nineteen years of his reign were\r\nyears of disorder unparalleled in any period of our history. On the\r\nlanding of Henry the First's daughter, \"the Empress Matilda,\" who\r\nclaimed the English crown for her son Henry, a long struggle ensued,\r\nand the country was divided between the adherents of the two rivals,\r\nthe West supporting Matilda, and London and the East Stephen. For a\r\ntime the successes in war alternated between the two parties. A defeat\r\nat Lincoln left Stephen a prisoner in the hands of his enemies; but\r\nafter his escape he laid siege to the city of Oxford, where Matilda\r\nhad assembled her followers. \"The Lady\" of the English (as Matilda was\r\nthen called) had retreated into the castle, which, though a place of\r\ngreat strength, proved to be insufficiently victualled. It was\r\nsurrounded and cut off from all supplies without, and at Christmastide\r\n(1142), after a siege of three months, Matilda consulted her own\r\nsafety by taking flight. On a cold December night, when the ground was\r\ncovered with snow, she quitted the castle at midnight, attended by\r\nfour knights, who as well as herself were clothed in white, in order\r\nthat they might pass unobserved through the lines of their enemies.\r\nThe adventurous \"Lady\" made good her escape, and crossing the river\r\nunnoticed on the ice, found her way to Abingdon. The long anarchy was\r\nended by the Treaty of Wallingford (1153), Stephen being recognised as\r\nking during his life, and the succession devolving upon Matilda's son\r\nHenry. A year had hardly passed from the signing of the treaty, when\r\nStephen's death gave Henry the crown, and his coronation took place at\r\nChristmastide, 1154, at Westminster.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF HENRY II.,\r\n\r\nit has been truly said, \"initiated the rule of law,\" as distinct from\r\ndespotism, whether personal or tempered by routine, of the Norman\r\nkings. And now the despotic barons began gradually to be shorn of\r\ntheir power, and the dungeons of their \"Adulterine\" castles to be\r\nstripped of their horrors, and it seemed more appropriate to celebrate\r\nthe season of glad tidings. King Henry the Second kept his first\r\nChristmas at Bermondsey with great solemnity, marking the occasion by\r\npassing his royal word to expel all foreigners from the kingdom,\r\nwhereupon William of Ypres and his Flemings decamped without waiting\r\nfor further notice. In 1158 Henry, celebrating the Christmas festival\r\nat Worcester, took the crown from his head and placed it upon the\r\naltar, after which he never wore it. But he did not cease to keep\r\nChristmas. In 1171 he went to Ireland, where the chiefs of the land\r\ndisplayed a wonderful alacrity in taking the oath of allegiance, and\r\nwere rewarded by being entertained in a style that astonished them.\r\nFinding no place in Dublin large enough to contain his own followers,\r\nmuch less his guests, Henry had a house built in Irish fashion of\r\ntwigs and wattles in the village of Hogges, and there held high\r\nrevelry during Christmastide, teaching his new subjects to eat cranes'\r\nflesh, and take their part in miracle plays, masques, mummeries, and\r\ntournaments. And a great number of oxen were roasted, so that all the\r\npeople might take part in the rejoicings.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS ENTERTAINMENTS AT CONSTANTINOPLE.\r\n\r\nIn his description of Christian Constantinople, Benjamin of Tudela, a\r\nSpanish Jew, who travelled through the East in the twelfth century\r\n(1159 or 1160), describes a \"place where the king diverts himself,\r\ncalled the hippodrome, near to the wall of the palace. There it is\r\nthat every year, on the day of the birth of Jesus the Nazarene, the\r\nking gives a grand entertainment. There are represented by magic arts\r\nbefore the king and queen, figures of all kinds of men that exist in\r\nthe world; thither also are taken lions, bears, tigers, and wild\r\nasses, which are made to fight together; as well as birds. There is no\r\nsuch sight to be seen in all the world.\" At Constantinople, on the\r\nmarriage of the Emperor Manuel with Mary, daughter of the Prince of\r\nAntioch, on Christmas Day, 1161, there were great rejoicings, and\r\nsimilar spectacular entertainments to those described by Benjamin of\r\nTudela.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ARCHBISHOP MURDERED AT CHRISTMASTIDE.\r\n\r\nDuring the Christmas festival of 1170 (December 29th) occurred an\r\nevent memorable in ecclesiastical history--the murder of Thomas\r\nBecket, Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1162 Becket (who had previously\r\nbeen Chancellor to Henry II.) was made Archbishop, in succession to\r\nArchbishop Theobald. The King soon found that he who had served him\r\nfaithfully as Chancellor would oppose him doggedly as Archbishop.\r\nHenry determined to subject the Church as well as the State to the\r\nsupremacy of the law; and Becket determined to resist the King to the\r\nend, thus manifesting his desire for martyrdom in the cause of the\r\nChurch. Henry had greatly offended the Archbishop by causing his\r\neldest son to be crowned by the Archbishop of York. For this violation\r\nof the rights of Canterbury Becket threatened to lay the country under\r\nan interdict, which he had the power from the Pope to pronounce. A\r\nsort of reconciliation was effected between the King and the\r\nArchbishop at Freteval on July 21, 1170, but a further dispute arose\r\non Becket delaying his return to England, the King being anxious to\r\nget him out of France. The Archbishop was full of complaints against\r\nHenry for the injuries he had done to his see, and the King stood upon\r\nhis dignity, regardless of the threatened interdiction. The Archbishop\r\nreturned to England on the 1st of December, and was joyfully received\r\nby the people. His enemies, however, and especially the family of De\r\nBroc, did all they could to annoy him; and on Christmas Day he uttered\r\na violent anathema against them. He preached from the text, \"I come to\r\ndie among you,\" evidently anticipating what might be the personal\r\nconsequences of his action. He told his congregation that one of the\r\narchbishops had been a martyr, and they would probably soon see\r\nanother; but before he departed home he would avenge some of the\r\nwrongs the Church had suffered during the previous seven years. Then\r\nhe thundered forth his sentence of excommunication against Ranulph and\r\nRobert de Broc, and Nigellus, rector of Harrow. Meanwhile news had\r\nreached the King that Becket had excommunicated certain bishops who\r\nhad taken part in his son's coronation. In a fit of exasperation the\r\nKing uttered some hasty words of anger against the Archbishop. Acting\r\nupon these, four of Henry's knights--Hugh de Morville, Reginald\r\nFitzUrse, William de Tracy, and Richard Brito--crossed to England,\r\ntaking with them Ranulf de Broc and a band of men, and murdered the\r\nArchbishop in Canterbury Cathedral. In the altercation which took\r\nplace before the consummation of the terrible deed, the Primate was\r\nasked to absolve the bishops whom he had excommunicated, but he\r\nrefused in a defiant and insulting manner. \"Then die,\" exclaimed\r\nFitzUrse, striking at Becket's head with his weapon; but the devoted\r\ncross-bearer warded off the blow with his own arm, which was badly\r\ncut, so that the Archbishop was but slightly injured. One of the\r\nattacking party then called out, \"Fly, or thou diest!\" The Archbishop,\r\nhowever, clasped his hands, and, with the blood streaming down his\r\nface, fervently exclaimed, \"To God, to St. Mary, to the holy patrons\r\nof this Church, and to St. Denis I commend my soul and the Church's\r\ncause.\" He was then struck down by a second blow, and the third\r\ncompleted the tragedy; whereupon one of the murderers, putting his\r\nfoot on the dead prelate's neck, cried, \"Thus dies a traitor!\" In 1173\r\nthe Archbishop was canonised, and his festival was appointed for the\r\nday of his martyrdom; and for three centuries after his death the\r\nshrine of St. Thomas at Canterbury was a favourite place of\r\npilgrimage, so great was the impression that his martyrdom made on the\r\nminds of the English people. As early as the Easter of 1171 Becket's\r\nsepulchre was the scene of many miracles, if Matthew Paris, the\r\nhistorian, is to be believed. What must have been the credulity of the\r\npeople in an age when an historian could gravely write, as Matthew\r\nParis did in 1171? \"In this year, about Easter, it pleased the Lord\r\nJesus Christ to irradiate his glorious martyr Thomas Becket with many\r\nmiracles, that it might appear to all the world he had obtained a\r\nvictory suitable to his merits. None who approached his sepulchre in\r\nfaith returned without a cure. For strength was restored to the lame,\r\nhearing to the deaf, sight to the blind, speech to the dumb, health to\r\nthe lepers, and life to the dead. Nay, not only men and women, but\r\neven birds and beasts were raised from death to life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL CHRISTMASES AT WINDSOR.\r\n\r\nWindsor Castle appears to have been the favourite residence of Henry\r\nII. When, in 1175, he had united with him his son Henry in his crown\r\nand prerogatives, the two kings held an assembly at Windsor, attended\r\nby the judges, deputies of counties and districts, and all the great\r\nofficers of state. Henry also kept his ensuing Christmas with the\r\nmagnificence and display peculiar to the times, and all the ancient\r\nsports and usages; in which the nobles and gentry of the surrounding\r\ncountry assisted with much splendour at the hunt and tourney, and\r\nbestowed lavish gifts on the spectators and the people. After the\r\nkingdom was parcelled out into four jurisdictions, another assembly\r\nwas held at the castle, in 1179, by the two kings; and, in 1184, Henry\r\nfor the last time celebrated his Christmas in the same hall of state:\r\nhis son, who had shared the throne with him, being then dead.\r\n\r\nFor the festivals of this period the tables of princes, prelates, and\r\ngreat barons were plentifully supplied with many dishes of meat\r\ndressed in various ways. The Normans sent agents into different\r\ncountries to collect the most rare dishes for their tables, by which\r\nmeans, says John of Salisbury, this island, which is naturally\r\nproductive of plenty and variety of provisions, was overflowed with\r\neverything that could inflame a luxurious appetite. The same writer\r\nsays he was present at an entertainment which lasted from three\r\no'clock in the afternoon to midnight; at which delicacies were served\r\nup which had been brought from Constantinople, Babylon, Alexandria,\r\nPalestine, Tripoli, Syria, and Phoenicia. The sumptuous\r\nentertainments which the kings of England gave to their nobles and\r\nprelates at the festivals of Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide\r\ndiffused a taste for profuse and expensive banqueting; for the wealthy\r\nbarons, prelates, and gentry, in their own castles and mansions,\r\nimitated the splendour of the royal entertainments. Great men had some\r\nkinds of provisions at their tables which are not now to be found in\r\nBritain. When Henry II. entertained his own court, the great officers\r\nof his army, and all the kings and great men in Ireland, at the feast\r\nof Christmas, 1171, the Irish princes and chieftains were quite\r\nastonished at the profusion and variety of provisions which they\r\nbeheld, and were with difficulty prevailed on by Henry to eat the\r\nflesh of cranes, a kind of food to which they had not been accustomed.\r\nDellegrout, maupigyrum, karumpie, and other dishes were then used, the\r\ncomposition of which is now unknown, or doubtful. Persons of rank and\r\nwealth had variety of drinks, as well as meats; for, besides wines of\r\nvarious kinds, they had pigment, morat, mead, hypocras, claret, cider,\r\nperry, and ale. The claret of those times was wine clarified and mixed\r\nwith spices, and hypocras was wine mixed with honey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A COOK OF THE PERIOD.]\r\n\r\nThe profusion of viands and drinks, obtained at great expense from\r\ndifferent parts of the world for the gratification of the animal\r\nappetites at such festivals as have been described, naturally led to\r\n\r\n\r\nEXCESSES IN EATING AND DRINKING,\r\n\r\nand from the statements and illustrations in old manuscripts it would\r\nappear that \"the merry monks\" were prominent in gastronomical circles.\r\nAnd extant records also state that the abbots of some of the\r\nmonasteries found it necessary to make regulations restraining the\r\nmonks, and to these regulations the monks objected. Consequently the\r\nmonks of St. Swithin at Winchester made a formal complaint to Henry\r\nII. against their abbot for taking away three of the thirteen dishes\r\nthey used to have at dinner. The monks of Canterbury were still more\r\nluxurious, for they had at least seventeen dishes every day besides a\r\ndessert; and these dishes were dressed with spices and sauces which\r\nexcited the appetite as well as pleased the taste. And of course the\r\nfestive season of Christmas was an occasion of special indulgence.\r\nSometimes serious excesses were followed by severe discipline,\r\nadministered after the manner shown in the ancient illustration which\r\nis reproduced here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONK UNDERGOING DISCIPLINE.]\r\n\r\nBut these excesses were by no means confined to the monks. The Norman\r\nbarons and gentry adopted many of the manners of the English among\r\nwhom they lived, and especially was this the case in regard to the\r\ndrinking customs of Christmastide. Instead of commending the Normans\r\nof his time for their sobriety, as he might have done their ancestors,\r\nPeter of Blois, who was chaplain to Henry II., says: \"When you behold\r\nour barons and knights going upon a military expedition you see their\r\nbaggage horses loaded, not with iron but wine, not with lances but\r\ncheeses, not with swords but bottles, not with spears but spits. You\r\nwould imagine they were going to prepare a great feast rather than to\r\nmake war. There are even too many who boast of their excessive\r\ndrunkenness and gluttony, and labour to acquire fame by swallowing\r\ngreat quantities of meat and drink.\" The earliest existing carol known\r\nto antiquaries is in the Anglo-Norman language, and contains\r\nreferences to the drinking customs of the period:--\r\n\r\n \"To English ale, and Gascon wine,\r\n  And French, doth Christmas much incline--\r\n          And Anjou's too;\r\n  He makes his neighbour freely drink,\r\n  So that in sleep his head doth sink\r\n          Often by day.\r\n  May joys flow from God above\r\n  To all those who Christmas love.\r\n\r\n  Lords, by Christmas and the host\r\n  Of this mansion hear my toast--\r\n         Drink it well--\r\n  Each must drain his cup of wine,\r\n\r\n  And I the first will toss off mine:\r\n          Thus I advise,\r\n  Here then I bid you all _Wassail_,\r\n  Cursed be he who will not say Drinkhail.\"[17]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WASSAILING AT CHRISTMASTIDE.]\r\n\r\nProceeding with our historical narrative we come now to\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANTIC REIGN OF RICHARD THE FIRST,\r\n\r\nsurnamed Coeur de Lion, the second son of Henry II. and Eleanor of\r\nAquitaine, who succeeded to the English throne on the death of his\r\nfather in 1189. Richard is generally supposed to have derived his\r\nsurname from a superiority of animal courage; but, if the metrical\r\nromance bearing his name, and written in the thirteenth century, be\r\nentitled to credit, he earned it nobly and literally, by plucking out\r\nthe heart of a lion, to whose fury he had been exposed by the Duke of\r\nAustria for having slain his son with a blow of his fist. In the\r\nnumerous descriptions afforded by the romance Richard is a most\r\nimposing personage. He is said to have carried with him to the\r\nCrusades, and to have afterwards presented to Tancred, King of Sicily,\r\nthe wonder-working sword of King Arthur--\r\n\r\n \"The gude sword Caliburne\r\n   that Arthur luffed so well.\"\r\n\r\nHe is also said to have carried a shaft, or lance, 14 feet in length,\r\nand\r\n\r\n              \"An axe for the nones,\r\n  To break therewith the Sarasyns bones.\r\n  The head was wrought right wele,\r\n  Therein was twenty pounds of steel.\"\r\n\r\nBut, without attempting to follow Richard through all the brilliant\r\nepisodes of his romantic career, there can be no doubt that he was a\r\nking of great strength and courage, and that his valorous deeds won\r\nthe admiration of poets and chroniclers, who have surrounded him with\r\na splendid halo of romance. Contemporary writers tell us that while\r\nRichard kept magnificent Christmases abroad with the King of Sicily\r\nand other potentates, his justiciars (especially the extravagant\r\nWilliam Longchamp, Bishop of Ely) were no less lavish in their\r\nexpenditure for festive entertainments at home. And the old romance of\r\n\"Richard Coeur de Lion\" assures us that--\r\n\r\n \"Christmas is a time full honest;\r\n  Kyng Richard it honoured with gret feste.\r\n  All his clerks and barouns\r\n  Were set in their pavylouns,\r\n  And seryed with grete plente\r\n  Of mete and drink and each dainte.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the Crusades had a vast influence upon our\r\nliterary tastes, as well as upon the national manners and the\r\nfestivities of Christmastide. On their return from the Holy Land the\r\npilgrims and Crusaders brought with them new subjects for theatrical\r\nrepresentation, founded on the objects of their devotion and the\r\nincidents in their wars, and these found expression in the early\r\nmysteries and other plays of Christmastide--that of St. George and the\r\nDragon, which survived to modern times, probably owing its origin to\r\nthis period. It is to Richard Coeur de Lion that we are indebted for\r\nthe rise of chivalry in England. It was he who developed tilts and\r\ntournaments, and under his auspices these diversions assumed a\r\nmilitary air, the genius of poetry flourished, and the fair sex was\r\nexalted in admiration. How delightful was it then, beneath the\r\ninspiring gaze of the fair--\r\n\r\n \"Sternly to strike the quintin down;\r\n  Or fiercely storm some turf-formed town;\r\n  To rush with valour's doughty sway,\r\n  Against a Babylon of clay;\r\n  A Memphis shake with furious shock,\r\n  Or raze some flower-built Antioch!\"[18]\r\n\r\nOn the death of Richard, in 1199, his brother\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN WAS CROWNED KING OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nThe youngest and favourite son of Henry II., John, was humoured in\r\nchildhood and grew to be an arrogant and petulant man, and was one of\r\nthe worst of English kings. He possessed ability, but not discipline.\r\nHe could neither govern himself nor his kingdom. He was tyrannical and\r\npassionate, and spent a good deal of time in the gratification of his\r\nanimal appetites. He was fond of display and good living, and\r\nextravagant in his Christmas entertainments. When, in 1201, he kept\r\nChristmas at Guildford he taxed his purse and ingenuity in providing\r\nall his servitors with costly apparel, and he was greatly annoyed\r\nbecause the Archbishop of Canterbury, in a similar fit of sumptuary\r\nextravagance, sought to outdo his sovereign. John, however, cunningly\r\nconcealed his displeasure at the time, but punished the prelate by a\r\ncostly celebration of the next Easter festival at Canterbury at the\r\nArchbishop's expense. In consequence of John's frequent quarrels with\r\nhis nobles the attendance at his Christmas feasts became smaller every\r\nyear, until he could only muster a very meagre company around his\r\nfestive board, and it was said that he had almost as many enemies as\r\nthere were nobles in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn 1205 John spent his Christmas at the ancient town of Brill, in the\r\nVale of Aylesbury, and in 1213 he kept a Royal Christmas in the great\r\nhall at Westminster.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNA CHARTA DEMANDED AT A CHRISTMAS FESTIVAL.\r\n\r\nThe Christmas of 1214 is memorable in English history as the festival\r\nat which the barons demanded from King John that document which as the\r\nfoundation of our English liberties is known to us by the name of\r\n_Magna Charta_, that is, the Great Charter. John's tyranny and\r\nlawlessness had become intolerable, and the people's hope hung on the\r\nfortunes of the French campaign in which he was then engaged. His\r\ndefeat at the battle of Bouvines, fought on July 27, 1214, gave\r\nstrength to his opponents; and after his return to England the barons\r\nsecretly met at St. Edmundsbury and swore to demand from him, if\r\nneedful by force of arms, the restoration of their liberties by\r\ncharter under the king's seal. Having agreed to assemble at the Court\r\nfor this purpose during the approaching festival of Christmas they\r\nseparated. When Christmas Day arrived John was at Worcester, attended\r\nonly by a few of his immediate retainers and some foreign mercenaries.\r\nNone of his great vassals came, as was customary at Christmas, to\r\noffer their congratulations. His attendants tried in vain to assume an\r\nappearance of cheerfulness and festivity; but John, alarmed at the\r\nabsence of the barons, hastily rode to London and there shut himself\r\nup in the house of the Knights Templars. On the Feast of the Epiphany\r\nthe barons assembled in great force at London and presenting\r\nthemselves in arms before the King formally demanded his confirmation\r\nof the laws of Edward the Confessor and Henry I. At first John assumed\r\na bold and defiant air and met the barons with an absolute refusal\r\nand threats; but, finding the nobles were firm, he sank to the\r\nmeanness of subterfuge, and pleaded the necessity of time for the\r\nconsideration of demands so weighty. With some reluctance the barons\r\ngranted the delay, and ultimately, in 1215, the tyrant bowed to the\r\ninevitable, called the barons to a conference at Runnymede, and there\r\nsigned the Great Charter, whose most important clauses protect the\r\npersonal liberty and property of every freeman in the kingdom by\r\ngiving security from arbitrary imprisonment and unjust exactions.\r\n\r\n    [16] \"Short History of the Norman Conquest.\"\r\n\r\n    [17] Wassail and Drinkhail are both derived from the\r\n    Anglo-Saxon. They were the common drinking pledges of the\r\n    age. Wassail is equivalent to the phrase, \"Your health,\"\r\n    of the present day. Drinkhail, which literally signifies\r\n    \"drink health,\" was the usual acknowledgment of the other\r\n    pledge. The carol from which the verses are quoted was\r\n    evidently sung by the wandering minstrels who visited the\r\n    castles of the Norman nobility at the festive season of\r\n    Christmas.\r\n\r\n    [18] Grattan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS, FROM MAGNA CHARTA TO THE END OF THE WARS OF THE ROSES.\r\n\r\n(1215-1485.)\r\n\r\nSoon after the disaster which overtook John's army at the Wash the\r\nKing ended his wretched career by death. He died on October 18, 1216,\r\nin the castle of Newark on the Trent, and the old chroniclers describe\r\nhim as dying in an extremity of agony and remorse.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY THE THIRD,\r\n\r\nsometimes called \"Henry of Winchester,\" came to the throne in\r\ntroublous times, before he was ten years of age. The tyranny of his\r\nfather had alienated every class of his subjects, and the barons who\r\nhad obtained Magna Charta from King John had called in Louis of\r\nFrance. But through the conciliatory measures of the Regent Pembroke\r\ntowards the barons, and the strong support which the Roman Church gave\r\nthe boy-king (whose father had meanly done homage to the Pope), the\r\nforeigners were expelled, and the opposition of the barons was\r\nsuppressed for a time, though in later years they again struggled with\r\nthe crown for supremacy of power. When Henry had grown to manhood and\r\nthe responsibility of government rested upon his own shoulders, he\r\nstill exulted in the protection of the Holy See, which found in him a\r\nsubservient vassal. He fasted during Lent, but feasted right royally\r\nboth at Christmas and Easter. In 1234 he kept a grand Christmas in the\r\nGreat Hall at Westminster, and other royal Christmases were celebrated\r\nat Windsor Castle and at his palace at Winchester. He made large\r\nadditions to Windsor Castle, and some of his mandates giving minute\r\ndirections for the decoration of his palace at Winchester are still\r\npreserved. He enjoyed the old plays and ballets of Christmastide\r\nintroduced from France at this period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROYAL PARTY DINING IN STATE.]\r\n\r\nHenry the Third's most splendid Christmas was in the twentieth year of\r\nhis reign, when he welcomed Eleanor, daughter of the Count of\r\nProvence, to whom he was married on January 14, 1236. The youthful\r\nprincess left Provence amidst the rejoicings of the whole kingdom.\r\nShe was accompanied by Henry's ambassadors and a grand cavalcade, in\r\nwhich were more than three hundred ladies on horseback. Her route lay\r\nthrough Navarre and France. On reaching England, at Dover, the\r\nprincess and her train proceeded to Canterbury, where Henry awaited\r\ntheir coming. It was in that ancient city that the royal pair were\r\nmarried by the Archbishop Edmund and the prelates who accompanied\r\nEleanor. From Canterbury the newly-wedded king and queen set out for\r\nLondon, attended by a splendid array of nobles, prelates, knights and\r\nladies. On the 20th of January, Eleanor was crowned at Westminster\r\nwith great splendour. Matthew Paris, the historian, gives an\r\ninteresting description of the royal procession, and the loyal welcome\r\nof the citizens of London: \"There had assembled together so great a\r\nnumber of the nobility of both sexes, so great a number of religious\r\norders, so great a concourse of the populace, and so great a variety\r\nof players, that London could scarcely contain them in her capacious\r\nbosom. Therefore was the city adorned with silk hangings, and with\r\nbanners, crowns, palls, tapers, and lamps, and with certain marvellous\r\ningenuities and devices; all the streets being cleaned from dirt, mud,\r\nsticks and everything offensive. The citizens of London going to meet\r\nthe king and queen, ornamented and trapped and wondrously sported\r\ntheir swift horses; and on the same day they went from the City to\r\nWestminster, that they might discharge the service of butler to the\r\nking in his coronation, which is acknowledged to belong to them of\r\nancient right. They went in well-marshalled array, adorned in silken\r\nvestments, wrapped in gold-woven mantles, with fancifully-devised\r\ngarments, sitting on valuable horses refulgent with new bits and\r\nsaddles: and they bore three hundred and sixty gold and silver cups,\r\nthe king's trumpeters going before and sounding their trumpets; so\r\nthat so wonderful a novelty produced a laudable astonishment in the\r\nspectators.\" The literary monk of St. Albans also describes the\r\nsplendour of the feast, and the order of the service of the different\r\nvassals of the crown, many of whom were called upon at the coronation\r\nto perform certain peculiar services. According to the ancient City\r\nrecords, \"these served in order in that most elegant and unheard-of\r\nfeast: the Bishop of Chichester, the Chancellor, with the cup of\r\nprecious stones, which was one of the ancient regalia of the king,\r\nclothed in his pontificals, preceded the king, who was clad in royal\r\nattire, and wearing the crown. Hugh de Pateshall walked before with\r\nthe patine, clothed in a dalmatica; and the Earls of Chester, Lincoln,\r\nand Warren, bearing the swords, preceded him. But the two renowned\r\nknights, Sir Richard Siward and Sir Nicholas de Molis, carried the two\r\nroyal sceptres before the king; and the square purple cloth of silk,\r\nwhich was supported upon four silver lances, with four little bells of\r\nsilver gilt, held over the king wherever he walked, was carried by the\r\nbarons of the Cinque Ports; four being assigned to each lance, from\r\nthe diversity of ports, that one port should not seem to be preferred\r\nbefore the other. The same in like manner bore a cloth of silk over\r\nthe queen, walking behind the king, which said cloths they claimed to\r\nbe theirs by right, and obtained them. And William de Beauchamp of\r\nBedford, who had the office of almoner from times of old, found the\r\nstriped cloth or _burel_, which was laid down under the king's feet as\r\nhe went from the hall as far as the pulpit of the Church of\r\nWestminster; and that part of the cloth that was _within_ the Church\r\nalways fell to the sexton in whatever church the king was crowned; and\r\nall that was _without_ the church was distributed among the poor, by\r\nthe hands of William the almoner.\" The ancient records contain many\r\nother particulars respecting the ceremonies which graced the marriage\r\nfeast of Henry and Eleanor of Provence, but enough has been quoted to\r\nshow the magnificence of the celebration.\r\n\r\nYear by year, as the Christmas festival came round, it was royally\r\ncelebrated wherever the Court happened to be, even though the king had\r\nto pledge his plate and jewels with the citizens of London to\r\nreplenish his exchequer. But Henry's Royal Christmases did not allay\r\nthe growing disaffection of his subjects on account of his showing too\r\nmuch favour to foreigners; and some of the barons who attended the\r\nRoyal Christmas at Westminster in 1241, left in high dudgeon, because\r\nthe place of honour at the banquet was occupied by the papal legate,\r\nthen about to leave England, \"to the sorrow of no man but the king.\"\r\nIn 1252, Henry gave in marriage his beautiful daughter Margaret, to\r\nAlexander, King of the Scots, and held his Christmas at the same time.\r\nThe city of York was the scene of the regal festivities. The marriage\r\ntook place on Christmas Day, the bridegroom and many of his nobles\r\nreceiving knighthood at the hands of the English king. Henry seems to\r\nhave conciliated the English barons for a time, for most of them were\r\npresent at the marriage festivities, and he counted a thousand knights\r\nin his train; while Alexander brought sixty splendidly-attired\r\nScottish knights with him. That the banqueting was on no mean scale is\r\nevident from the fact that six hundred fat oxen were slaughtered for\r\nthe occasion, the gift of the Archbishop of York, who also subscribed\r\nfour thousand marks (L2,700) towards the expenses. The consumption of\r\nmeats and drinks at such feasts was enormous. An extant order of\r\nHenry's, addressed to his keeper of wines, directs him to deliver two\r\ntuns of white and one of red wine, to make garhiofilac and claret 'as\r\nusual,' for the king at Christmas; and upon another occasion the\r\nSheriffs of Gloucestershire and Sussex were called upon to supply part\r\nof the necessary provisions; the first named being directed to get\r\ntwenty salmon, and make pies of them; while the latter was instructed\r\nto send ten peacocks, ten brawns with their heads, and other things.\r\nAnd all this provision was necessary, for while Henry feasted the\r\nrich, he did not forget the poor. When he kept his Christmas at\r\nWinchester in 1248, he ordered his treasurer to fill Westminster Hall\r\nwith poor people, and feast them there for a week. Twenty years\r\nafterwards, he kept his Royal Christmas in London for fifteen days,\r\nopening a fair meantime at Westminster, and forbidding any shop to be\r\nopened in London as long as the festival lasted. This prohibition of\r\nbusiness naturally displeased the citizens of London, but the king\r\nwould not withdraw his prohibition until they agreed to make him a\r\npresent of two thousand pounds, upon the receipt of which the\r\nprohibition was withdrawn.\r\n\r\nWe cannot pass over this period without reference to the summoning of\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST ENGLISH PARLIAMENT,\r\n\r\nwhich was a great event of Christmastide.\r\n\r\nThe Barons' Wars interfered seriously with the Christmas festivities,\r\nbut they solved the problem of how to ensure the government of the\r\nrealm in accordance with the provisions of the Great Charter. The King\r\n(Henry III.) had sworn again and again to observe the Charter, but his\r\noath was no sooner taken than it was unscrupulously broken. The\r\nbarons, with the patriotic Simon de Montfort at their head, were\r\ndetermined to uphold the rights of the people, and insisted on the\r\nking's compliance with the provisions of the Charter; and this\r\nstruggle with the Crown yielded one of the greatest events of\r\nChristmastide: the summoning of the first national Parliament. By\r\nsummoning the representatives of the cities and boroughs to sit beside\r\nthe knights of the shires, the barons and the bishops in the\r\nParliament of the realm, Simon de Montfort created a new force in\r\nEnglish politics. This first national assembly met at Westminster, in\r\nJanuary, 1265, while the king was a prisoner of Earl Simon. The form\r\nof national representation thus inaugurated had an immense influence\r\non the rising liberties of the people, and has endured to our own\r\ntimes. It is not surprising, therefore, that the adoption of this\r\nmeasure by the great Earl of Leicester invested his memory with a\r\nlustre which has not been dimmed by the lapse of centuries. The\r\npaltering of the king called forth the patriotism of the people. \"So\r\nmay a glory from defect arise.\" The sevenfold lustre of the rainbow is\r\nonly seen when there is rain as well as sun.\r\n\r\n \"Only the prism's obstruction shows aright\r\n  The secret of a sunbeam, breaks its light\r\n  Into the jewelled bow from blankest white;\r\n    So may a glory from defect arise.\"[19]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH OF ROBIN HOOD ON CHRISTMAS EVE.\r\n\r\nThe famous freebooter, Robin Hood, who, according to tradition,\r\nflourished in Sherwood Forest in the distracted reign of Henry the\r\nThird, is said to have died on Christmas Eve, in the year 1247. The\r\ncareer of this hero of many popular ballads is not part of our\r\nsubject, though Hone[20] records his death as a Christmas event; and\r\nStowe, writing in 1590, evidently believes in Robin Hood as an\r\nhistorical personage, for he says, \"he suffered no woman to be\r\noppressed ... poor men's goods he spared, abundantly relieving them\r\nwith that which by theft he got from the abbeys, and the houses of\r\nrich old earles.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the doubtful doings of the romantic chief and his band of\r\nfreebooters, we now pass on to the\r\n\r\n\r\nREIGN OF EDWARD THE FIRST.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nEdward the First was in the truest sense a national king. He was\r\nEnglish to the core, and he won the love of his people by his bravery,\r\njustice, and good government. He joined freely in the national sports\r\nand pastimes, and kept the Christmas festival with great splendour.\r\nThere was much of the chivalric in his character, and he shared to the\r\nfull his people's love of hard fighting. He was invested with the\r\nhonour of knighthood and went to foreign courts to display his\r\nprowess. Matthew of Westminster states that while Edward was\r\ntravelling in France, he heard that a lord of Burgundy was continually\r\ncommitting outrages on the persons and property of his neighbours. In\r\nthe true spirit of chivalry Edward attacked the castle of the\r\nuncourteous baron. His prowess asserted the cause of justice, and he\r\nbestowed the domains which he had won upon a nobler lord. For the sake\r\nof acquiring military fame he exposed himself to great dangers in the\r\nHoly Land, and, during his journey homeward, saved his life by sheer\r\nfighting in a tournament at Challon. At his \"Round Table of\r\nKenilworth\" a hundred lords and ladies \"clad all in silk\" renewed the\r\nfaded glories of Arthur's Court, and kept Christmas with great\r\nmagnificence. In 1277, Llewellyn, Prince of Wales, bidden from his\r\nmountain fastnesses \"with a kiss of peace,\" sat a guest at the\r\nChristmas feast of Edward, but he was soon to fall the last defender\r\nof his weeping country's independence in unequal battle with the\r\nEnglish King. In 1281-2, Edward kept his feast of Christmas at\r\nWorcester, and there was \"such a frost and snow as no man living could\r\nremember the like.\" Rivers were frozen over, even including the Thames\r\nand Severn; fish in ponds, and birds in woods died for want of food;\r\nand on the breaking up of the ice five of the arches of old London\r\nbridge were carried away by the stream, and the like happened to many\r\nother bridges. In 1286 Edward kept his Christmas at Oxford, but the\r\nhonour was accompanied by an unpleasant episode in the hanging of the\r\nMayor by the King's command. In 1290, 1292, and 1303, Edward the\r\nFirst kept Royal Christmases in the great hall at Westminster. On\r\nhis way to Scotland, in the year 1299, the King witnessed the\r\nChristmas ceremonial of the Boy Bishop. He permitted one of the\r\nboy bishops to say vespers before him in his chapel at Heton, near\r\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne, and made a present to the performers of forty\r\nshillings, no inconsiderable sum in those days. During his Scotch\r\nwars, in 1301, Edward, on the approach of winter, took up his quarters\r\nin Linlithgow, where he built a castle and kept his Christmas; and\r\nduring his reign he celebrated the festival at other places not\r\nusually so honoured--namely, Bury, Ipswich, Bristol, Berwick,\r\nCarlisle, and Lincoln.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD THE SECOND\r\n\r\nsucceeded his father in 1307, being the fourth son of Edward I. and\r\nEleanor of Castile. He took great delight in the Christmas revels and\r\nexpended large sums of money in the entertainment of his court\r\nfavourites. In 1311 he kept his Christmas at York, rejoicing in the\r\npresence of Piers Gaveston, whom he had recalled from banishment in\r\nutter disregard of advice given to him by his father (Edward I.) on\r\nhis death-bed. Edward II. kept his Christmas in the great hall at\r\nWestminster in 1317, when, however, few nobles were present, \"because\r\nof discord betwixt them and the King;\" but in 1320 the Royal Christmas\r\nwas kept at Westminster \"with great honour and glorie.\" In 1324-5 the\r\nKing's Christmas was sumptuously observed at Nottingham, but the\r\nfollowing year found Edward a prisoner at Kenilworth, while his wife,\r\nwho had successfully intrigued with Roger Mortimer, leader of the\r\nBarons, observed the Christmas festivities with her son at\r\nWallingford, glad at the downfall of her husband. Edward was an\r\nirresolute and weak-minded king. He displayed singular incapacity for\r\ngovernment, wasting almost all his time in frivolous amusements. The\r\nchief characteristics of his reign were defeat and disgrace abroad,\r\nand misrule ending in misery at home. Instead of following the example\r\nof his noble father, Edward I., who has been deservedly styled \"the\r\ngreatest of the Plantagenets,\" he proved himself the weakest of that\r\nline of kings, spending his time in such trifling diversions as \"cross\r\nand pile,\" a game of chance with coins. He was so utterly devoid of\r\nself-respect that he even borrowed money of his barber to carry on\r\nthis frivolous pastime, such items as the following being found in his\r\nwardrobe rolls:--\"Item, paid to Henry, the king's barber, for money\r\nwhich he lent the king to play at cross and pile, five shillings.\r\nItem, paid to Pires Barnard, usher of the king's chamber, money which\r\nhe lent the king, and which he lost at cross and pile; to Monsieur\r\nRobert Wattewille eightpence.\" At length the barons, tired of\r\nEdward's misgovernment, revolted, and made the king a prisoner. During\r\nthe Christmas festival of 1326, Edward was imprisoned in Kenilworth\r\nCastle. While there he was informed that in a Parliament held at\r\nWestminster, during Christmas 1326-7, he was deposed, and his son\r\nEdward, then only fourteen years of age, elected in his stead. On the\r\n21st of September in the same year Edward II. ended his miserable\r\ncareer in Berkeley Castle, being, it is supposed, cruelly murdered by\r\nhis keepers.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD THE THIRD'S CORONATION\r\n\r\nfestivities were a sumptuous enlargement of the Christmas celebration,\r\nwhich usually extended over Twelfth Night. It is said that the\r\nbanqueting cost the equivalent of forty thousand pounds of our money;\r\nand before the young king there appeared quite a multitude of\r\nminstrels, mimics, and gleemen. Professor Henry Morley[21] gives a\r\nspecimen of the metrical romances which were translated from the\r\nFrench for recitation at the royal and noble banquets of this period.\r\nThey were \"busy with action, and told with a lively freedom;\" and, in\r\nthe one quoted, \"The Fabliau of Sir Cleges,\" we catch some interesting\r\nreferences to the celebration of Christmas:--\r\n\r\n \"Every year Sir Cleges would\r\n  At Christmas a great feast hold\r\n    In worship of that day,\r\n  As royal in alle thing\r\n  As he hadde been a king\r\n    For sooth as I you say.\r\n  Rich and poor in the country about\r\n  Should be there withouten doubt;\r\n    There would no man say nay.\r\n  Minstrels would not be behind,\r\n  For there they might most mirthes find\r\n    There would they be aye.\r\n\r\n \"Minstrels when the feast was done\r\n  Withouten giftes should not gon,\r\n    And that both rich and good:\r\n  Horse, robes and riche ring,\r\n  Gold, silver, and other thing,\r\n    To mend with their mood.\r\n  Ten yeare such feast be held,\r\n  In the worship of Mary mild\r\n    And for Him that died on the rood.\r\n  By that his good began to slake\r\n  For the great feasts that he did make.\r\n    The knight gentil of blood.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"KEPE OPEN COURT\" AT CHRISTMAS.\r\n\r\nFroissart, in Cap. XIIII. of his \"Chronicles,\"[22] gives the\r\nfollowing account of the Christmas Celebration at which Edward the\r\nThird was crowned:--\r\n\r\n\"After that the most part of the company of Heynaulte were departed,\r\nand syr John Heynaulte lorde of Beamonde taryed, the Quene gave leve\r\nto her people to departe, savynge a certayne noble knightis the whiche\r\nshe kept styl about her and her s[=o]ne, to counsell them, and\r\ncommaunded all them that departed, to be at London the next Christmas,\r\nfor as than she was determyned to kepe open court, and all they\r\npromysed her so to do. And whan Christmas was come, she helde a great\r\ncourt. And thyther came dukes, erles, barons, knightis, and all the\r\nnobles of the realme, with prelates, and burgesses of good townes, and\r\nat this assemble it was advised that the realme coud nat long endure\r\nwithout a head and a chief lord. Than they put in wrytynge all the\r\ndedis of the kyng who was in prison, and all that he had done by evyll\r\ncounsell, and all his usages, and evyll behavyngis, and how evyll he\r\nhad governed his realme, the which was redde openly in playn audience,\r\nto thentent that the noble sagis of the realme might take therof good\r\nadvyce, and to fall at acorde how the realme shuld be governed from\r\nthensforth; and whan all the cases and dedis that the kyng had done\r\nand c[=o]sented to, and all his behavyng and usages were red, and wel\r\nunderstand, the barons and knightis and al ye co[=u]sels of the\r\nrealme, drew them aparte to co[=u]sell, and the most part of them\r\naccorded, and namely the great lordes and nobles, with the burgesses\r\nof ye good townes, accordyng as they had hard say, and knew themselfe\r\nthe most parte of his dedis. Wherfore they c[=o]cluded that such a man\r\nwas nat worthy to be a kyng. But they all accorded that Edward his\r\neldeste son who was ther present, and was ryghtful heyre, shuld be\r\ncrowned kyng in stede of his father, so that he would take good\r\ncounsell, sage and true about hym, so that the realme from thensforth\r\nmyght be better governed than it was before, and that the olde kyng\r\nhis father shuld be well and honestly kept as long as he lyved\r\naccordyng to his astate; and thus as it was agreed by all the nobles,\r\nso it was accomplysshed, and than was crowned with a crowne royall at\r\nthe palaice of Westminster, beside L[=o]don, the yong kyng Edward the\r\nIII. who in his dayes after was right fortunate and happy in armes.\r\nThis coronacion was in the yere of our Lorde MCCCXXVI, on Christymas\r\nday, and as than the yong kyng was about the age of XVI., and they\r\nheld the fest tyl the c[=o]vercion of saynt Paule followyng: and in\r\nthe mean tyme greatly was fested sir John of Heynaulte and all the\r\nprincis and nobles of his co[=u]tre, and was gyven to hym, and to his\r\ncompany, many ryche jewels. And so he and his company in great feast\r\nand solas both with lordis and ladyes taried tyll the XII. day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD BALLIOL, OF SCOTLAND, DEFEATED AT CHRISTMAS.\r\n\r\nThe Christmas of 1332 is memorable in Scottish annals as the time of\r\nthe defeat of Edward Balliol, the \"phantom king\" of Scotland. His\r\nsuccess was as unreal as a dream. He was solemnly crowned at Scone in\r\nthe month of September, 1332, fondly imagining that he had permanently\r\nconquered the patriotic Scottish nobles who had opposed him. His\r\nreign, however, only lasted for a few months. The leaders of the\r\nnational party suddenly assembled a force, and attacked him, while he\r\nwas feasting at Annan, in Dumfriesshire, where he had gone to keep his\r\nChristmas. A body of horse under Sir Archibald, the young Earl of\r\nMoray, and Sir Simon Fraser, made a dash into the town to surprise\r\nBalliol, and he escaped only by springing upon a horse without any\r\nsaddle, leaving behind him his brother Henry slain. Balliol escaped to\r\nEngland and was kindly received by Edward III., who afterwards made\r\nfresh expeditions into Scotland to support him. \"Whenever the English\r\nking appeared the Scots retired to their mountain fastnesses, while\r\nEdward and his army overran the country with little opposition, burnt\r\nthe houses, and laid waste the lands of those whom he styled rebels;\r\nbut whenever he returned to England they came forth again, only the\r\nmore embittered against the contemptible minion of the English king,\r\nthe more determined against the tyranny of England. The regent, Sir\r\nAndrew Murray, pursued, with untiring activity, Balliol and his\r\nadherents. When Edward marched homeward to spend in London the\r\nChristmas of 1336, he left Scotland to all appearance prostrate, and\r\nflattered himself that it was completely subdued. Never was it further\r\nfrom such a condition. Only one spirit animated the Scottish\r\nnation--that of eternal resistance to the monarch who had inflicted on\r\nit such calamities, and set a slave on its throne.\"[23]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTTAGE CHRISTMAS-KEEPING IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\nAt this period the greatest of the Bishops of Winchester, William of\r\nWykeham, was a schoolboy. He was born of humble parents, educated at\r\nWinchester school, and afterwards became secretary to Uvedale, Lord of\r\nWickham Manor, through whom he was introduced to King Edward III. In\r\nhis interesting \"Story of the Boyhood of William of Wykeham,\" the Rev.\r\nW. A. C. Chevalier thus pictures William's Christmas holidays:--\r\n\r\n\"Three days after William's arrival home was Christmas-eve. There were\r\ngreat preparations in the cottage for spending Christmas worthily, for\r\nif there was one thing more than another that John Longe believed in,\r\nit was the proper keeping of Christmas. It was a part of the worthy\r\nyeoman's faith. He was a humble and thorough believer in all the\r\ntenets of Christianity, he worshipped the Saviour and adored His\r\nNativity, but his faith was a cheerful one, and he thought he best\r\nhonoured his Master by enjoying the good gifts which He sent. Hence\r\nit was a part of his creed to be jovial at Christmas-tide. And so\r\nDame Alice had been busy all that day, and a part of the day before,\r\nmaking Christmas pies, dressing Christmas meats, and otherwise making\r\nready for the great festival. John Longe, too, had not been idle. He\r\nand his men had been working hard all day getting in huge Yule-logs\r\nfor the great kitchen fire, whilst William and little Agnes had been\r\nemployed in decorating the kitchen with evergreens and mistletoe,\r\ndisplaying in great profusion the red berries of the holly bushes.\r\nEverything was decked with evergreens, from the cups and platters on\r\nthe shelves to the hams and bacon hanging from the ceiling.\"\r\n\r\nAt length the preparations were completed; then came the telling of\r\ntales and cheerful gossip round the blazing fire on Christmas Eve, and\r\nthe roasting of chestnuts on the embers. \"Christmas Day passed at the\r\nlittle homestead with all the social and religious honours that the\r\nhonest yeoman could think of. The little household attended the\r\nservice of Mass in the morning, and then, with clear consciences and\r\nsimple hearts, spent the rest of the day in domestic and convivial\r\nenjoyment.\"\r\n\r\nReturning to royalty, we next see illustrated Froissart's statement\r\nthat \"Edward the third was right fortunate and happy in armes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD THE THIRD'S VICTORIES AND FESTIVITIES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDuring the invasion of France, Edward III. raised the martial glory of\r\nEngland by his splendid victories at Crecy, Poictiers, and other\r\nplaces; and he kept Christmas right royally with his soldiers on\r\nFrench soil. After the battle of Crecy, at which the Prince of Wales\r\ngained the celebrated title of the Black Prince, Edward marched upon\r\nCalais, and laid siege to it; and at length he took the place. During\r\nEdward's absence, England was invaded by David II. of Scotland, who\r\nwas defeated and taken prisoner by the army under Philippa, Edward's\r\nQueen. The brave Queen then joined King Edward on the French\r\nbattle-ground, and they kept the Christmas of 1346 with much\r\nrejoicing.\r\n\r\nDuring the Christmas festivities of this period the most noble Order\r\nof the Garter was instituted by King Edward III. to excite emulation\r\namongst the aristocratic warriors of the time, in imitation of orders\r\nof a similar kind, both religious and military, which had been\r\ninstituted by different monarchs of Europe; and that those who were\r\nadmitted to the order were enjoined to exalt the religion of Christ\r\nis evident from some lines which Chaucer addressed to the Lords and\r\nKnights--\r\n\r\n \"Do forth, do forth, continue your succour,\r\n  Hold up Christ's banner, let it not fall.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again--\r\n\r\n \"Ye Lordis eke, shining in noble fame,\r\n  To which appropered is the maintenance\r\n  Of Christ 'is cause; in honour of his name,\r\n  Shove on, and put his foes to utterance.\"\r\n\r\nIn imitation of King Arthur, Edward III. set up at Windsor a Round\r\nTable, which was consecrated with feasts and tournaments, and baptized\r\nwith the blood of the brave. On New Year's Day, 1344, he issued his\r\nroyal letters of protection for the safe-coming and return of foreign\r\nknights to the solemn jousts which he appointed to be held at Windsor\r\non St. Hilary's Day, in extension of the Christmas festivities. The\r\nfestival was opened with a splendid supper; and the next day, and\r\nuntil Lent, all kinds of knightly feats of arms were performed. \"The\r\nqueen and her ladies,\" says an old historian, \"that they might with\r\nmore convenience behold this spectacle, were orderly seated upon a\r\nfirm ballustrade, or scaffold, with rails before it, running all round\r\nthe lists. And certainly their extraordinary beauties, set so\r\nadvantageously forth with excessive riches of apparel, did prove a\r\nsight as full of pleasant encouragement to the combatants, as the\r\nfierce hacklings of men and horses, gallantly armed, were a delightful\r\nterror to the feminine beholders.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LADIES LOOKING FROM THE HUSTINGS UPON THE TOURNAMENT.]\r\n\r\nIn 1348 Edward III. kept a grand Christmas at Guildford. \"Orders were\r\ngiven to manufacture for the Christmas sports eighty tunics of buckram\r\nof different colours, and a large number of masks--some with faces of\r\nwomen, some with beards, some like angel heads of silver. There were\r\nto be mantles embroidered with heads of dragons, tunics wrought with\r\nheads and wings of peacocks, and embroidered in many other fantastic\r\nways. The celebration of Christmas lasted from All Hallow's Eve, the\r\n31st of October, till the day after the Purification, the 3rd of\r\nFebruary. At the court a lord of misrule was appointed, who reigned\r\nduring the whole of this period, and was called 'the master of merry\r\ndisports.' He ruled over and organised all the games and sports, and\r\nduring the period of his rule there was nothing but a succession of\r\nmasques, disguisings, and dances of all kinds. All the nobles, even\r\nthe Mayor of London, had an officer of this kind chosen in their\r\nhouseholds. Dancing was a very favourite amusement. It was practised\r\nby the nobility of both sexes. The damsels of London spent their\r\nevenings in dancing before their masters' doors, and the country\r\nlasses danced upon the village green.\"[24]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LORD OF MISRULE.]\r\n\r\nA Royal Christmas was kept at Westminster, with great splendour, in\r\n1358, when King Edward had two crowned guests at his feast; but these\r\nwere present from no choice of their own: they were the victims to the\r\nfortune of war at Poictiers and Neville's Cross. And in\r\n1362, King David of Scotland and the King of Cyprus met at King\r\nEdward's grand entertainments. The later years of his life were spent\r\nby this great warrior-king in partial retirement from public affairs,\r\nand under the influence of his mistress, Alice Perrers, while John of\r\nGaunt took a leading part in the government of the state. In 1376\r\nEdward the Black Prince died, and the same year King Edward III. kept\r\nhis last Christmas at Westminster, the festival being made memorable\r\nby all the nobles of the realm attending to swear fealty to the son of\r\nthe Black Prince, who, by the King's desire, took precedence of his\r\nuncles at the banquet as befitted the heir apparent to the crown. The\r\nKing died on the 21st of June, 1377, having reigned for just over half\r\na century.\r\n\r\nThe old chronicler, Stowe, refers to a\r\n\r\n\r\nTERRIBLE CHRISTMAS TEMPEST,\r\n\r\nwhich he says occurred in 1362: \"The King held his Christmas at\r\nWindsore, and the XV. day following a sore and vehement south-west\r\nwinde brake forth, so hideous that it overthrew high houses, towers,\r\nsteeples, and trees, and so bowed them, that the residue which fell\r\nnot, but remained standing, were the weaker.\"\r\n\r\nKing Edward the Third's wardrobe accounts witness to the\r\n\r\n\r\nCOSTLY CHRISTMAS ROBES\r\n\r\nthat were worn at this period. And these accounts also show that Alice\r\nPerrers was associated with the King's daughter and granddaughter in\r\nthe Christmas entertainments. There are items in 1376 stating that the\r\nKing's daughter Isabella (styled Countess of Bedford), and her\r\ndaughter (afterwards wife of Vere, Earl of Oxford), were provided with\r\nrich garments trimmed with ermine, in the fashion of the robes of the\r\nGarter, and with others of shaggy velvet, trimmed with the same fur,\r\nfor the Christmas festival; while articles of apparel equally costly\r\nare registered as sent by the King to his chamber at Shene, to be\r\ngiven to Alice Perrers. And at a festival at Windsor the King caused\r\ntwelve ladies (including his daughters and Alice Perrers) to be\r\nclothed in handsome hunting suits, with ornamented bows and arrows, to\r\nshoot at the King's deer; and a very attractive band of foresters they\r\nmade. We have also seen that eighty costly tunics were provided for\r\nthe Christmas sports and disguisings at Guildford.\r\n\r\nWe now come to a\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMICALLY CRUEL CHRISTMAS INCIDENT,\r\n\r\nrecorded by Sir John Froissart, and which he says gave \"great joye\" to\r\nthe hilarious \"knightes and squyers\" who kept the festival with \"the\r\nErle of Foiz\":--\r\n\r\n\"So it was on a Christmas day the Erle of Foiz helde a great feest,\r\nand a plentifull of knightes and squyers, as it is his usage; and it\r\nwas a colde day, and the erle dyned in the hall, and with him great\r\ncompany of lordes; and after dyner he departed out of the hall, and\r\nwent up into a galarye of xxiiii stayres of heyght, in which galarye\r\nther was a great chymney, wherin they made fyre whan therle was ther;\r\nand at that tyme there was but a small fyre, for the erle loved no\r\ngreat fyre; howbeit, he hadde woode ynoughe there about, and in Bierne\r\nis wode ynoughe. The same daye it was a great frost and very colde:\r\nand when the erle was in the galarye, and saw the fyre so lytell, he\r\nsayde to the knightes and squiers about hym, Sirs, this is but a small\r\nfyre, and the day so colde: than Ernalton of Spayne went downe the\r\nstayres, and beneth in the courte he sawe a great meny of asses, laden\r\nwith woode to serve the house: than he went and toke one of the\r\ngrettest asses, with all the woode, and layde hym on his backe, and\r\nwent up all the stayres into the galary, and dyde cast downe the asse\r\nwith all the woode into the chymney, and the asses fete upward;\r\nwherof the erle of Foiz had great joye, and so hadde all they that\r\nwere there, and had marveyle of his strength howe he alone came up all\r\nthe stayres with the asse and the woode in his necke.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPassing on to\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF RICHARD THE SECOND,\r\n\r\nthe son of Edward the Black Prince and Joan of Kent, who came to the\r\nthrone (in tutelage) on the death of his grandfather, Edward III.\r\n(1377), we find that costly banquetings, disguisings, pageants, and\r\nplays continued to be the diversions of Christmastide at court. From\r\nthe rolls of the royal wardrobe, it appears that at the Christmas\r\nfestival in 1391, the sages of the law were made subjects for\r\ndisguisements, this entry being made: \"Pro XXI _coifs_ de tela linea\r\npro hominibus de lege contrafactis pro Ludo regis tempore natalis\r\nDomini anno XII.\" That is, for twenty-one linen coifs for\r\ncounterfeiting men of the law in the King's play at Christmas. And\r\nStrutt[25] says that in the same year (1391) the parish clerks of\r\nLondon put forth a play at Skinners' Wells, near Smithfield, which\r\ncontinued three days: the king, queen, and many of the nobility, being\r\npresent at the performance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [On one side is the legend, MONETA NOVA ADRIANI\r\nSTVLTORV PAPE, the last E being in the field of the piece, on which is\r\nrepresented the Pope, with his double cross and tiara, with a fool in\r\nfull costume approaching his bauble to the pontifical cross, and two\r\npersons behind, who form part of his escort. On the reverse is a\r\n\"mother fool,\" with her bauble, attended by a grotesque person with a\r\ncardinal's hat, with the oft-recurring legend, STVLTORV INFINITVS EST\r\nNVMERVS.]]\r\n\r\nBut the miracle plays and mysteries performed by the Churchmen\r\ndiffered greatly from the secular plays and interludes which at this\r\nperiod \"were acted by strolling companies of minstrels, jugglers,\r\ntumblers, dancers, bourdours, or jesters, and other performers\r\nproperly qualified for the different parts of the entertainment, which\r\nadmitted of a variety of exhibitions. These pastimes are of higher\r\nantiquity than the ecclesiastical plays; and they were much relished\r\nnot only by the vulgar part of the people, but also by the nobility.\r\nThe courts of the kings of England, and the castles of the great earls\r\nand barons, were crowded with the performers of the secular plays,\r\nwhere they were well received and handsomely rewarded; vast sums of\r\nmoney were lavishly bestowed upon these secular itinerants, which\r\ninduced the monks and other ecclesiastics to turn actors themselves,\r\nin order to obtain a share of the public bounty. But to give the\r\nbetter colouring to their undertaking, they took the subjects of their\r\ndialogues from the holy writ, and performed them in the churches. The\r\nsecular showmen, however, retained their popularity notwithstanding\r\nthe exertions of their clerical rivals, who diligently endeavoured to\r\nbring them into disgrace, by bitterly inveighing against the\r\nfilthiness and immorality of their exhibitions. On the other hand, the\r\nitinerant players sometimes invaded the province of the churchmen, and\r\nperformed their mysteries, or others similar to them, as we find from\r\na petition presented to Richard II. by the scholars of St. Paul's\r\nSchool, wherein complaint is made against the secular actors, because\r\nthey took upon themselves to act plays composed from the Scripture\r\nhistory, to the great prejudice of the clergy, who had been at much\r\nexpense to prepare such performances for public exhibition at the\r\nfestival of Christmas.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A COURT FOOL.]\r\n\r\nIn his Christmas feasts Richard the Second outdid his predecessors in\r\nprodigal hospitality. He delighted in the neighbourhood of Eltham,\r\nand spent much of his time in feasting with his favourites at the\r\nroyal palace there. In 1386 (notwithstanding the still prevalent\r\ndistress, which had continued from the time of the peasant revolt)\r\nRichard kept the Christmas festivities at Eltham with great\r\nextravagance, at the same time entertaining Leon, King of Armenia, in\r\na manner utterly unjustified by the state of the royal exchequer,\r\nwhich had been replenished by illegal methods. And, on the completion\r\nof his enlargements and embellishments of Westminster Hall, Richard\r\nreopened it with \"a most royal Christmas feast\" of twenty-eight oxen\r\nand three hundred sheep, and game and fowls without number, feeding\r\nten thousand guests for many days. Yet but a few years afterwards\r\n(such is the fickleness of fortune and the instability of human\r\naffairs) this same king, who had seen the \"Merciless Parliament,\" who\r\nhad robbed Hereford of his estates, who had been robed in cloth of\r\ngold and precious stones, and who had alienated his subjects by his\r\nown extravagance, was himself deposed and sentenced to lifelong\r\nbanishment, his doom being pronounced in the very hall which he had\r\nreared to such magnificence for his own glory. Thus ingloriously\r\nRichard disappears from history, for nothing certain is known of the\r\ntime, manner, or place of his death, though it is conjectured that he\r\nwas speedily murdered. How history repeats itself! Richard's\r\nignominious end recalls to mind the verse in which an English poet\r\ndepicts the end of an Eastern king who was too fond of revelling:--\r\n\r\n \"That night they slew him on his father's throne,\r\n  The deed unnoticed and the hand unknown:\r\n  Crownless and sceptreless Belshazzar lay,\r\n  A robe of purple round a form of clay!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAND CHRISTMAS TOURNAMENT.\r\n\r\nAn example of the tournaments which were favourite diversions of kings\r\nand nobles at this period is found in that held at Christmastide in\r\nLondon in 1389. Richard II., his three uncles, and the greater barons\r\nhaving heard of a famous tournament at Paris at the entry of Isabel,\r\nQueen of France, resolved to hold one of equal splendour at London, in\r\nwhich sixty English knights, conducted to the scene of action by sixty\r\nladies, should challenge all foreign knights. They therefore sent\r\nheralds into all parts of England, Scotland, Germany, Italy, Flanders,\r\nBrabant, Hainault, and France to proclaim the time, place, and other\r\ncircumstances of the proposed gathering, and to invite all valorous\r\nknights and squires to honour it with their presence. This, says the\r\nhistorian, excited a strong desire in the knights and squires of all\r\nthese countries to attend to see the manners and equipages of the\r\nEnglish, and others to tourney. The lists were prepared in Smithfield,\r\nand chambers erected around them for the accommodation of the king,\r\nqueen, princes, lords, ladies, heralds, and other spectators. As the\r\ntime approached many important personages of both sexes, attended by\r\nnumerous retinues, arrived in London. On the first day of the\r\ntournament (Sunday) sixty-five horses, richly furnished for the\r\njousts, issued one by one from the Tower, each conducted by a squire\r\nof honour, and proceeded in a slow pace through the streets of London\r\nto Smithfield, attended by a numerous band of trumpeters and other\r\nminstrels. Immediately after, sixty young ladies, elegantly attired\r\nand riding on palfreys, issued from the same place, and each lady\r\nleading a knight completely armed by a silver chain, they proceeded\r\nslowly to the field. When they arrived there the ladies were lifted\r\nfrom the palfreys and conducted to the chambers provided for them; the\r\nknights mounted their horses and began the jousts, in which they\r\nexhibited such feats of valour and dexterity as won the admiration of\r\nthe spectators. When the approach of night put an end to the jousts\r\nthe company repaired to the palace of the Bishop of London, in St.\r\nPaul's Street, where the king and queen then staying, the supper was\r\nprepared. The ladies, knights, and heralds who had been appointed\r\njudges awarded one of the prizes, a crown of gold, to the Earl of St.\r\nPaul as the best performer among the foreign knights, and the other, a\r\nrich girdle adorned with gold and precious stones, to the Earl of\r\nHuntingdon as the best performer of the English. After a sumptuous\r\nsupper the ladies and knights spent the remainder of the night in\r\ndancing. The tournaments were continued in a similar manner on Monday,\r\nTuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and on Saturday the Court,\r\nwith all the company, removed to Windsor, where the jousts, feasting,\r\nand other diversions were renewed, and lasted several days longer.\r\nSubsequently the king presented the foreign ladies, lords, and knights\r\nwith valuable gifts, and they returned to their own countries highly\r\npleased with the entertainment which they had enjoyed in England.\r\n\r\n\r\nKING HENRY THE FOURTH\r\n\r\nwas born at Bolingbroke, in Lincolnshire, being the eldest son of John\r\nof Gaunt and of his first wife, the heiress of the house of Lancaster,\r\nand a grandson of Edward III. On the death of John of Gaunt in 1399,\r\nRichard II. seized his lands, having in the previous year banished\r\nHenry of Bolingbroke. On Henry hearing what had occurred, knowing his\r\nown popularity and Richard's unpopularity, Henry returned from\r\nbanishment, and succeeded in an attack on Richard, whom he made a\r\nprisoner. Then summoning a Parliament, at which Richard was formally\r\ndeposed and himself made king, Henry came to the throne with the title\r\nof Henry IV. Soon, however, he found himself menaced by danger. Some\r\nof the lords who had been stripped of the honours and wealth heaped\r\nupon them by Richard entered into a conspiracy to assassinate Henry\r\nthe usurper. During the Christmas holidays they met frequently at the\r\nlodgings of the Abbot of Westminster to plan the king's destruction.\r\nAfter much deliberation they agreed to hold a splendid tournament at\r\nOxford on the 3rd of January, 1400. Henry was to be invited to\r\npreside, and while intent on the spectacle a number of picked men were\r\nto kill him and his sons. The king was keeping his Christmas at\r\nWindsor, whither the Earl of Huntingdon presented himself and gave him\r\nthe invitation. Henry accepted it, but on the 2nd of January, the day\r\nprevious to the tournament, the Earl of Rutland, who was privy to the\r\nplot, went secretly to Windsor and informed the king of the\r\narrangements which had been made for his assassination. The same\r\nevening, after dusk, the king proceeded to London; and the next day\r\nwhen the conspirators assembled at Oxford they were surprised to find\r\nthat neither the king nor their own accomplice, Rutland, had arrived.\r\nSuspecting treachery they resolved to proceed at once to Windsor and\r\nsurprise Henry, but arrived only to find that he had escaped. They\r\nafterwards raised the standard of revolt, but their insurrection\r\nproved abortive, and the fate of the leaders was summary and\r\nsanguinary.\r\n\r\nThe favourite palace of Henry the Fourth was at Eltham, where, in the\r\nsecond year of his reign, he kept a grand Christmas, and entertained\r\nthe Emperor of Constantinople. At this festival the men of London made\r\na \"gret mummyng to him of XII. Aldermen and theire sones, for which\r\nthey had gret thanke.\" Similar festivities were observed at several\r\nsubsequent festivals; then the king's health gave way, and he passed\r\nthe last Christmas of his life in seclusion at Eltham, suffering from\r\nfits of epilepsy, and lying frequently for hours in an unconscious\r\nstate. After Candlemas he was so much better as to be able to return\r\nto his palace at Westminster, but he died there on the 20th of March\r\nthe same year (1413). The final scene and the parting words of the\r\nking to his son, who became Henry V., have been beautifully depicted\r\nby Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n\r\nKING HENRY THE FIFTH.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the Christmas festival in 1414 a conspiracy to\r\nmurder the king is alleged against the Lollards, but the charge has\r\nnever been satisfactorily proved. \"If we are to believe the\r\nchroniclers of the times the Lollards resolved to anticipate their\r\nenemies, to take up arms and to repel force by force. Seeing clearly\r\nthat war to the death was determined against them by the Church, and\r\nthat the king had yielded at least a tacit consent to this iniquitous\r\npolicy, they came to the conclusion to kill not only the bishops, but\r\nthe king and all his kin. So atrocious a conspiracy is not readily to\r\nbe credited against men who contended for a greater purity of gospel\r\ntruth, nor against men of the practical and military knowledge of Lord\r\nCobham. But over the whole of these transactions there hangs a veil of\r\nimpenetrable mystery, and we can only say that the Lollards are\r\ncharged with endeavouring to surprise the king and his brother at\r\nEltham, as they were keeping their Christmas festivities there, and\r\nthat this attempt failed through the Court receiving intimation of the\r\ndesign and suddenly removing to Westminster.\"[26] Lord Cobham was put\r\nto death by cruel torture in St. Giles's Fields, London, on Christmas\r\nDay, 1418.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of his reign Henry invaded France and achieved a\r\nseries of brilliant successes, including the famous victory at\r\nAgincourt. The hero of this great battle did not allow the holiday\r\nseason to interfere with his military operations; but he did\r\ngenerously suspend proceedings against Rouen upon Christmas Day and\r\nsupply his hungry foes with food for that day only, so that they might\r\nkeep the feast of Christmas. After his military successes in France\r\nHenry married the Princess Katherine, the youngest daughter of Charles\r\nVI., King of France, and the king and queen spent their first\r\nChristmas of wedded life at Paris, the festival being celebrated by a\r\nseries of magnificent entertainments. Henry's subsequent journey to\r\nEngland was \"like the ovation of an ancient conqueror.\" He and his\r\nqueen were received with great festivity at the different towns on\r\ntheir way, and on the 1st of February they left Calais, and landed at\r\nDover, where, according to Monstrelet, \"Katherine was received as if\r\nshe had been an angel of God.\" All classes united to make the\r\nreception of the hero of Agincourt and his beautiful bride a most\r\nmagnificent one. They proceeded first to Eltham, and thence, after due\r\nrest, to London, where Katherine was crowned with great rejoicing on\r\nthe 24th of February, 1421. Henry's brilliant career was cut short by\r\nhis death on the last day of August, 1422.\r\n\r\n \"Small time, but, in that small, most greatly liv'd\r\n    This star of England: fortune made his sword;\r\n  By which the world's best garden he achiev'd,\r\n    And of it left his son imperial lord.\"[27]\r\n\r\nFabian's account of the stately feast at the coronation of\r\nHenry the Fifth's newly-wedded consort is an interesting\r\npicture of the\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURT LIFE AND CHRISTMAS FESTIVITIES OF THE PERIOD.\r\n\r\nQueen Katherine was conveyed to the great hall at Westminster and\r\nthere set to dinner. Upon her right hand, at the end of the table, sat\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury, and Henry, surnamed the rich Cardinal of\r\nWinchester; and upon her left hand the King of Scotland in his royal\r\nrobes; near the end sat the Duchess of York and the Countess of\r\nHuntingdon. The Earl of March, holding a sceptre, knelt upon her right\r\nside, and the Earl-Marshal upon her left; his Countess sat at the\r\nQueen's left foot under the table, and the Countess of Kent at her\r\nright foot. Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, was overlooker, and stood\r\nbefore the Queen bareheaded; Sir Richard Nevill was carver, the Earl\r\nof Suffolk's brother cupbearer, Sir John Steward server, Lord Clifford\r\npanterer, Lord Willoughby butler, Lord Grey de Ruthyn naperer, the\r\nLord Audley almoner, and the Earl of Worcester, Earl-Marshal, rode\r\nabout the hall during dinner on a charger, with a number of constables\r\nto keep order.\r\n\r\nThe bill of fare consisted of: _First course_--Brawn and mustard,\r\ndedells in burneaux, frument with balien, pike in erbage (pike stuffed\r\nwith herbs), lamprey powdered, trout, codling, fried plaice and\r\nmarling, crabs, leche lumbard flourished, and tarts. Then came a\r\nsubtlety representing a pelican sitting on her nest with her young and\r\nan image of St. Katherine bearing a book and disputing with the\r\ndoctors, bearing a reason (motto) in her right hand, saying, in the\r\nFrench apparently of Stratford-at-the-Bow, \"Madame le Royne,\" and the\r\npelican as an answer--\r\n\r\n \"Ce est la signe\r\n  Et lu Roy\r\n  Pur tenir ioy\r\n  Et a tout sa gent,\r\n  Elle mete sa entent.\"\r\n\r\n_Second course_--Jelly coloured with columbine flowers, white potage,\r\nor cream of almonds, bream of the sea, conger, soles, cheven, barbel\r\nwith roach, fresh salmon, halibut, gurnets, broiled roach, fried\r\nsmelt, crayfish or lobster, leche damask with the king's word or\r\nproverb flourished \"_une sanz plus_.\" Lamprey fresh baked, flampeyn\r\nflourished with an escutcheon royal, therein three crowns of gold,\r\nplanted with flowers de luce, and flowers of camomile wrought of\r\nconfections. Then a subtlety representing a panther with an image of\r\nSt. Katherine having a wheel in one hand and a roll with a reason in\r\nthe other, saying--\r\n\r\n \"La royne ma file,\r\n  In ceste ile,\r\n  Par bon reson\r\n  Alues renoun.\"\r\n\r\n_Third course_--Dates in composite, cream mottled, carp, turbot,\r\ntench, perch, fresh sturgeon with whelks, porpoise roasted, memis\r\nfried, crayfish, prawns, eels roasted with lamprey, a leche called the\r\nwhite leche flourished with hawthorn leaves and red haws, and a march\r\npane, garnished with figures of angels, having among them an image of\r\nSt. Katherine holding this reason--\r\n\r\n \"Il est ecrit,\r\n  Pour voir et dit\r\n  Per mariage pur\r\n  C'est guerre ne dure.\"\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, a subtlety representing a tiger looking into a mirror, and\r\na man sitting on horseback fully armed, holding in his arms a tiger's\r\nwhelp, with this reason, \"Par force sanz reson il ay pryse ceste\r\nbeste,\" and with his one hand making a countenance of throwing mirrors\r\nat the great tiger, the which held this reason--\r\n\r\n \"Gile de mirror,\r\n  Ma fete distour.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Marble Panel Florentine 1420,\r\nS. Kensington museum.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nKING HENRY THE SIXTH\r\n\r\nbecame king in 1422, before he was nine months old, and although the\r\nregency of the two kingdoms to which he was heir had been arranged by\r\nHenry V. before his death, the reign of the third king of the House of\r\nLancaster saw the undoing of much that had been accomplished in the\r\nreigns of his father and grandfather. It was during the reign of\r\nHenry VI. that Joan of Arc came forward alleging her Divine commission\r\nto rescue France from the English invader. But it is not part of our\r\nsubject to describe her heroic career. The troublous times which made\r\nthe French heroine a name in history were unfavourable to Christmas\r\nfestivities. The Royal Christmases of Henry the Sixth were less costly\r\nthan those of his immediate predecessors. But as soon as he was old\r\nenough to do so he observed the festival, as did also his soldiers,\r\neven in time of war. Mills[28] mentions that, \"during the memorable\r\nsiege of Orleans [1428-9], at the request of the English the\r\nfestivities of Christmas suspended the horrors of war, and the\r\nnativity of the Saviour was commemorated to the sound of martial\r\nmusic. Talbot, Suffolk, and other ornaments of English chivalry made\r\npresents of fruits to the accomplished Dunois, who vied with their\r\ncourtesy by presenting to Suffolk some black plush he wished for as a\r\nlining for his dress in the then winter season. The high-spirited\r\nknights of one side challenged the prowest knights of the other, as\r\ntheir predecessors in chivalry had done. It is observable, however,\r\nthat these jousts were not held in honour of the ladies, but the\r\nchallenge always declared that if there were in the other host a\r\nknight so generous and loving of his country as to be willing to\r\ncombat in her defence, he was invited to present himself.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Henry IV.'s Cradle]\r\n\r\nIn 1433 Henry kept his Christmas at Bury, and in 1436 at Kenilworth\r\nCastle. Nothing remarkable, however, is recorded respecting these\r\nfestivities. But some interesting particulars have been preserved of a\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS PLAY PERFORMED IN 1445\r\n\r\nat Middleton Tower, Norfolk, the family seat of Lord Scales, one of\r\nthe early owners of Sandringham, which is now a residence of the\r\nPrince of Wales. Mrs. Herbert Jones[29] says:--\r\n\r\n\"One winter, when he was about forty-six years old, in a quiet\r\ninterval soon after Henry the Sixth's marriage to Margaret of Anjou,\r\nLord Scales and his wife were living at Middleton. In a south-east\r\ndirection lay the higher ground where rose the Blackborough Priory of\r\nnuns, founded by a previous Lady Scales; west of them, at three miles'\r\ndistance, bristling with the architecture of the Middle Ages in all\r\nits bloom and beauty, before religious disunion had defaced it,\r\nprosperous in its self-government, stood the town of Lynn.\r\n\r\n\"The mayor and council had organised a play to be acted on Christmas\r\nDay, 1445, before the Lord Scales at Middleton, representing scenes\r\nfrom the Nativity of our Lord. Large sums were paid by order of the\r\nmayor for the requisite dresses, ornaments, and scenery, some of which\r\nwere supplied by the 'Nathan' of Lynn, and others prepared and bought\r\nexpressly. 'John Clerk' performed the angel Gabriel, and a lady of the\r\nname of Gilbert the Virgin Mary. Their parts were to be sung. Four\r\nother performers were also paid for their services, and the whole\r\nparty, headed by the mayor, set off with their paraphernalia in a\r\ncart, harnessed to four or more horses, for Middleton on Christmas\r\nmorning. The breakfast of the carters was paid for at the inn by the\r\ntown, but the magnates from Lynn and the actors were entertained at\r\nthe castle.[30]\r\n\r\n\"It was in the courtyard that this quaint representation took place;\r\nthe musical dialogues, the songs and hymns, the profusion of\r\nornaments, personal and otherwise, recorded as pressed on to the\r\nstage, the grotesque angel and virgin, must have furnished a lively\r\nhour under the castle walls on that long-ago Christmas Day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WARS OF THE ROSES.\r\n\r\nDuring the destructive wars of York and Lancaster the festivities of\r\nChristmas were frequently interrupted by hostilities, for some of the\r\nmost bloody encounters (as, for example, the terrible battle of\r\nWakefield) occurred at Christmastide. The wars of the contending\r\nfactions continued throughout the reign of Henry VI., whose personal\r\nweakness left the House of Lancaster at the mercy of the Parliament,\r\nin which the voice of the Barons was paramount. That the country was\r\nin a state of shameful misgovernment was shown by the attitude of the\r\ncommercial class and the insurrection under John Cade; yet Henry could\r\nfind time for amusement. \"Under pretence of change of air the court\r\nremoved to Coventry that the king might enjoy the sports of the\r\nfield.\"[31]\r\n\r\nThe Christmases of Henry were not kept with the splendour which\r\ncharacterised those of his rival and successor, Edward IV. Henry's\r\nhabits were religious, and his house expenses parsimonious--sometimes\r\nnecessarily so, for he was short of money. From the introduction to\r\nthe \"Paston Letters\" (edited by Mr. James Gairdner) it appears that\r\nthe king was in such impecunious circumstances in 1451 that he had to\r\nborrow his expenses for Christmas: \"The government was getting\r\nparalysed alike by debt and by indecision. 'As for tidings here,'\r\nwrites John Bocking, 'I certify you all that is nought, or will be\r\nnought. The king borroweth his expenses.'\" Henry anticipated what Ben\r\nJonson discovered in a later age, that--\r\n\r\n \"Christmas is near;\r\n  And neither good cheer,\r\n  Mirth, fooling, nor wit,\r\n  Nor any least fit\r\n  Of gambol or sport\r\n  Will come at the Court,\r\n  If there be no money.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so rather than leave Christmas unobserved the poor king \"borrowed\r\nhis expenses.\" Subsequently Henry's health failed, and then later\r\ncomes the record: \"At Christmas [1454], to the great joy of the\r\nnation, the king began to recover from his painful illness. He woke\r\nup, as it were, from a long sleep. So decidedly had he regained his\r\nfaculties that on St. John's Day (27th December) he commanded his\r\nalmoner to ride to Canterbury with an offering, and his secretary to\r\npresent another at the shrine of St. Edward.\"[32]\r\n\r\nThe terrible battle of Wakefield at Christmastide, 1460, was one of\r\nthe most important victories won by the Lancastrians during the Wars\r\nof the Roses. The king, Henry VI., had secretly encouraged Richard,\r\nDuke of York, that the nation would soon be ready to assent to the\r\nrestoration of the legitimate branch of the royal family. Richard was\r\nthe son of Anne Mortimer, who was descended from Philippa, the only\r\ndaughter of the Duke of Clarence, second son of Edward III.; and\r\nconsequently he stood in the order of succession before the king\r\nactually on the throne, who was descended from John of Gaunt, a\r\nyounger son of Edward III. The Duke of York at length openly advanced\r\nhis title as the true heir to the crown, and urged Parliament to\r\nconfer it upon him. As, however, the Lancastrian branch of the royal\r\nfamily had enjoyed the crown for three generations it was resolved\r\nthat Henry VI. should continue to reign during his life and that\r\nRichard should succeed him. This compromise greatly displeased the\r\nqueen, Margaret, who was indignant at the injury it inflicted on her\r\nson. She therefore urged the nobles who had hitherto supported her\r\nhusband to take up arms on behalf of his son. Accordingly the Earl of\r\nNorthumberland, with Lords Dacre, Clifford, and Nevil, assembled an\r\narmy at York, and were soon joined by the Duke of Somerset and the\r\nEarl of Devon. \"Parliament being prorogued in December, the Duke of\r\nYork and the Earl of Salisbury hastened from London with a large armed\r\nforce towards York, but coming unexpectedly upon the troops of the\r\nDuke of Somerset at Worksop, their vanguard was destroyed. On the 21st\r\nof December, however, they reached Sandal Castle with six thousand\r\nmen, and kept their Christmas there, notwithstanding that the enemy\r\nunder the Duke of Somerset and the Earl of Northumberland were close\r\nby at Pontefract\" (_William Wyrcester_). On the 30th of December the\r\nopposing forces met at Wakefield, and in the terrible battle which\r\nensued Richard, Duke of York was slain, his son, Lord Rutland, was\r\nmurdered by Lord Clifford while escaping from the battlefield, and the\r\nEarl of Salisbury and others were taken as prisoners to Pontefract,\r\nwhere they were beheaded.\r\n\r\nEdward, son of Richard Duke of York, was afterwards joined by his\r\ncousin, Richard, Earl of Warwick, the famous \"kingmaker.\" They\r\nhastened northwards and met the Lancastrians at Towton, where a\r\ndecisive battle was fought, and won by the Yorkists. Edward was then\r\nrecognised by Parliament and proclaimed king as Edward IV., and Henry\r\nVI. was attainted of high treason.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN 1461 EDWARD THE FOURTH\r\n\r\ncalled his first Parliament at Westminster, and concluded the session\r\nby the unusual but popular measure of a speech from the throne to the\r\nCommons delivered by himself. It was during this session that the\r\nstatute was passed prohibiting the great and rich from giving or\r\nwearing any liveries or signs of companionship, except while serving\r\nunder the king; from receiving or maintaining plunderers, robbers,\r\nmalefactors, or unlawful hunters; and from allowing dice and cards in\r\ntheir houses beyond the twelve days of Christmas (Parl. Rolls, 488).\r\n\r\nThe Christmas festival was kept by Edward IV. with great magnificence,\r\nthe king's natural inclinations leading him to adopt whatever was\r\nsplendid and costly. \"At the Christmas festivities he appeared in a\r\nvariety of most costly dresses, of a form never seen before, which he\r\nthought displayed his person to considerable advantage\" (_Croyland\r\nChronicler_). Sir Frederick Madden's narrative of the visit of the\r\nLord of Granthuse, Governor of Holland, to Edward, in 1472, paints in\r\nglowing colours the luxury of the English Court. On his arrival at\r\nWindsor he was received by Lord Hastings, who conducted him to the\r\nchambers of the King and Queen. These apartments were richly hung with\r\ncloth of gold arras. When he had spoken with the King, who presented\r\nhim to the Queen's Grace, the Lord Chamberlain, Hastings, was ordered\r\nto conduct him to his chamber, where supper was ready for him. \"After\r\nhe had supped the King had him brought immediately to the Queen's own\r\nchamber, where she and her ladies were playing at the marteaux [a\r\ngame played with small balls of different colours]; and some of her\r\nladies were playing at closheys [ninepins] of ivory, and dancing, and\r\nsome at divers other games: the which sight was full pleasant to them.\r\nAlso the King danced with my Lady Elizabeth, his eldest daughter. In\r\nthe morning when Matins was done, the King heard, in his own chapel,\r\nOur Lady-Mass, which was most melodiously chaunted, the Lord Granthuse\r\nbeing present. When the Mass was done, the King gave the said Lord\r\nGranthuse a cup of gold, garnished with pearl. In the midst of the cup\r\nwas a great piece of unicorn's horn, to my estimation seven inches in\r\ncompass; and on the cover of the cup a great sapphire.\" After\r\nbreakfast the King came into the Quadrangle. \"My Lord Prince, also,\r\nborne by his Chamberlain, called Master Vaughan, which bade the Lord\r\nof Granthuse welcome. Then the King had him and all his company into\r\nthe little Park, where he made him have great sport; and there the\r\nKing made him ride on his own horse, on a right fair hobby, the which\r\nthe King gave him.\" The King's dinner was \"ordained\" in the Lodge,\r\nWindsor Park. After dinner they hunted again, and the King showed his\r\nguest his garden and vineyard of pleasure. Then \"the Queen did ordain\r\na great banquet in her own chamber, at which King Edward, her eldest\r\ndaughter the Lady Elisabeth, the Duchess of Exeter, the Lady Rivers,\r\nand the Lord of Granthuse, all sat with her at one mess; and, at the\r\nsame table, sat the Duke of Buckingham, my Lady, his wife, with divers\r\nother ladies, my Lord Hastings, Chamberlain to the King, my Lord\r\nBerners, Chamberlain to the Queen, the son of Lord Granthuse, and\r\nMaster George Barthe, Secretary to the Duke of Burgundy, Louis Stacy,\r\nUsher to the Duke of Burgundy, George Martigny, and also certain\r\nnobles of the King's own court. There was a side table, at which sat a\r\ngreat view (_show_) of ladies, all on the one side. Also, in the outer\r\nchamber, sat the Queen's gentlewomen, all on one side. And on the\r\nother side of the table, over against them, as many of the Lord\r\nGranthuse's servants, as touching to the abundant welfare, like as it\r\nis according to such a banquet. And when they had supped my Lady\r\nElizabeth, the King's eldest daughter, danced with the Duke of\r\nBuckingham and divers other ladies also. Then about nine of the clock,\r\nthe King and the Queen, with her ladies and gentlewomen, brought the\r\nsaid Lord of Granthuse to three chambers of plesance, all hanged with\r\nwhite silk and linen cloth, and all the floors covered with carpets.\r\nThere was ordained a bed for himself of as good down as could be\r\ngotten. The sheets of Rennes cloth and also fine fustians; the\r\ncounterpane, cloth of gold, furred with ermines. The tester and ceiler\r\nalso shining cloth of gold; the curtains of white sarcenet; as for his\r\nhead-suit and pillows, they were of the Queen's own ordonnance. In the\r\nsecond chamber was likewise another state-bed, all white. Also, in the\r\nsame chamber, was made a couch with feather beds, and hanged with a\r\ntent, knit like a net, and there was a cupboard. In the third chamber\r\nwas ordained a bayne (_bath_) or two, which were covered with tents of\r\nwhite cloth. And, when the King and the Queen with all her ladies and\r\ngentlemen had showed him these chambers, they turned again to their\r\nown chambers, and left the said Lord Granthuse there, accompanied with\r\nthe Lord Chamberlain (Hastings), who undressed him, and they both went\r\ntogether to the bath.--And when they had been in their baths as long\r\nas was their pleasure, they had green ginger, divers syrups, comfits,\r\nand ipocras, and then they went to bed. And in the morning he took his\r\ncup with the King and Queen, and returned to Westminster again.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1465 Edward the Fourth and his Queen kept Christmas in the Abbey at\r\nCoventry, and for six days (says _William Wyrcester_) \"the Duke of\r\nClarence dissembled there.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1478 the King celebrated the Christmas festival at Westminster with\r\ngreat pomp, wearing his crown, feasting his nobles, and making\r\npresents to his household; and in 1482-3 he kept a splendid Christmas\r\nat Eltham, more than two thousand people being fed at his expense\r\nevery day. Edward almost entirely rebuilt Eltham Palace, of which the\r\nhall was the noblest part. In that hall he kept the Christmas\r\nfestival, \"with bountiful hospitality for high and low, and abundance\r\nof mirth and sport.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the continental visitors who participated in the royal\r\nfestivities of this period was Leo von Rozmital, brother of George,\r\nKing of Bohemia. His retinue included Tetzel, who, in describing the\r\nCourt of Edward the Fourth, after remarking upon Edward's own handsome\r\nperson, says, \"The king has the finest set of courtiers that a man may\r\nfind in Christendom. He invited my Lord Leo and all his noble\r\ncompanions, and gave them a very costly feast, and also he gave to\r\neach of them the medal of his order, to every knight a golden one, and\r\nto every one who was not a knight a silver one; and he himself hung\r\nthem upon their necks. Another day the king called us to court. In the\r\nmorning the queen (Elizabeth Woodville) went from child-bed to church\r\nwith a splendid procession of many priests, bearing relics, and many\r\nscholars, all singing, and carrying burning candles. Besides there was\r\na great company of women and maidens from the country and from London,\r\nwho were bidden to attend. There were also a great number of\r\ntrumpeters, pipers, and other players, with forty-two of the king's\r\nsinging men, who sang very sweetly. Also, there were four and twenty\r\nheralds and pursuivants, and sixty lords and knights. Then came the\r\nqueen, led by two dukes, and with a canopy borne over her. Behind her\r\nfollowed her mother and above sixty ladies and maidens. Having heard\r\nthe service sung, and kneeled down in the church, she returned with\r\nthe same procession to her palace. Here all who had taken part in the\r\nprocession were invited to a feast, and all sat down, the men and the\r\nwomen, the clergy and the laity, each in his rank, filling four large\r\nrooms. Also, the king invited my lord and all his noble attendants to\r\nthe table where he usually dined with his courtiers. And one of the\r\nking's greatest lords must sit at the king's table upon the king's\r\nstool, in the place of the king; and my lord sat at the same table\r\nonly two steps below him. Then all the honours which were due to the\r\nking had to be paid to the lord who sat in his place, and also to my\r\nlord; and it is incredible what ceremonies we observed there. While we\r\nwere eating, the king was making presents to all the trumpeters,\r\npipers, players, and heralds; to the last alone he gave four hundred\r\nnobles, and every one, when he received his pay, came to the tables\r\nand told aloud what the king had given him. When my lord had done\r\neating, he was conducted into a costly ornamented room, where the\r\nqueen was to dine, and there he was seated in a corner that he might\r\nsee all the expensive provisions. The queen sat down on a golden stool\r\nalone at her table, and her mother and the queen's sister stood far\r\nbelow her. And when the queen spoke to her mother or to the king's\r\nsister, they kneeled down every time before her, and remained kneeling\r\nuntil the queen drank water. And all her ladies and maids, and those\r\nwho waited upon her, even great lords, had to kneel while she was\r\neating, which continued three hours(!). After dinner there was\r\ndancing, but the queen remained sitting upon her stool, and her mother\r\nkneeled before her. The king's sister danced with two dukes, and the\r\nbeautiful dances and reverences performed before the queen--the like I\r\nhave never seen, nor such beautiful maidens. Among them were eight\r\nduchesses, and above thirty countesses and others, all daughters of\r\ngreat people. After the dance the king's singing men came in and sang.\r\nWhen the king heard mass sung in his private chapel my lord was\r\nadmitted: then the king had his relics shown to us, and many sacred\r\nthings in London. Among them we saw a stone from the Mount of Olives,\r\nupon which there is the footprint of Jesus Christ, our Lady's girdle,\r\nand many other relics.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCARDS AND OTHER CHRISTMAS DIVERSIONS IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\nThe amusements of the people in the fifteenth century are referred to\r\nby Thomas Wright, Esq., M.A., F.S.A., who says: \"In England, in the\r\nthird year of the reign of Edward IV. (1463), the importation of\r\nplaying-cards, probably from Germany, was forbidden, among other\r\nthings, by Act of Parliament; and as that Act is understood to have\r\nbeen called for by the English manufacturers, who suffered by the\r\nforeign trade, it can hardly be doubted that cards were then\r\nmanufactured in England on a rather extensive scale. Cards had then,\r\nindeed, evidently become very popular in England; and only twenty\r\nyears afterwards they are spoken of as the common Christmas game, for\r\nMargery Paston wrote as follows to her husband, John Paston, on the\r\n24th of December in 1483:--'Please it you to weet (_know_) that I sent\r\nyour eldest son John to my Lady Morley, to have knowledge of what\r\nsports were used in her house in the Christmas next following after\r\nthe decease of my lord her husband; and she said that there were none\r\ndisguisings, nor harpings, nor luting, nor singing, nor none loud\r\ndisports, but playing at the tables, and the chess, and _cards_--such\r\ndisports she gave her folks leave to play, and none other.... I sent\r\nyour younger son to the lady Stapleton, and she said according to my\r\nlady Morley's saying in that, and as she had seen used in places of\r\nworship (_gentlemen's houses_) there as she had been.' ... After the\r\nmiddle of the fifteenth century, cards came into very general use; and\r\nat the beginning of the following century, there was such a rage for\r\ncard-playing, that an attempt was made early in the reign of Henry\r\nVIII. to restrict their use by law to the period of Christmas. When,\r\nhowever, people sat down to dinner at noon, and had no other\r\noccupation for the rest of the day, they needed amusement of some sort\r\nto pass the time; and a poet of the fifteenth century observes truly--\r\n\r\n 'A man may dryfe forthe the day that long tyme dwellis\r\n  With harpyng and pipyng, and other mery spellis,\r\n          With gle, and wyth game.'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LADY MUSICIAN OF THE 15TH CENTURY.]\r\n\r\nAnother book well known to bibliomaniacs (\"Dives and Pauper,\" ed. W.\r\nde Worde; 1496) says: \"For to represente in playnge at Crystmasse\r\nherodes and the thre kynges and other processes of the gospelles both\r\nthen and at Ester and other tymes also it is lefull and\r\nc[=o]mendable.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUSTIC CHRISTMAS MINSTREL WITH PIPE AND TABOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD THE FIFTH\r\n\r\nsucceeded his father, Edward IV., in the dangerous days of 1483. He\r\nwas at Ludlow when his father died, being under the guardianship of\r\nhis uncle, Earl Rivers, and attended by other members of the Woodville\r\nfamily. Almost immediately he set out for London, but when he reached\r\nStony Stratford, on April 29th, he was met by his uncle Richard, Duke\r\nof Gloucester, who had arrested Lord Rivers and Lord Richard Grey. The\r\nyoung king (a boy of thirteen) renewed his journey under Gloucester's\r\ncharge, and on reaching London was lodged in the Tower. His mother, on\r\nhearing of the arrest of Rivers and Grey, had taken sanctuary at\r\nWestminster. Lord Hastings, a supporter of the king, was arrested and\r\nexecuted because he would not sanction Gloucester's nefarious schemes\r\nfor obtaining the throne. About the same time Rivers and Grey were\r\nbeheaded at Pontefract, whither they had been taken by Gloucester's\r\norders. Soon afterwards the Queen was compelled to deliver up the\r\nyoung Duke of York to Richard, who sent him to join his brother in the\r\nTower. On June 22nd, at the request of Richard, Dr. Shaw, brother of\r\nthe Lord Mayor of London, delivered a sermon at St. Paul's Cross, in\r\nwhich he insisted on the illegitimacy of Edward V. and his brother. On\r\nJune 25th a deputation of nobles and citizens of London offered the\r\ncrown to Richard. He accepted it, and began to reign as Richard III.\r\nAnd, according to a confession afterwards made by Sir James Tyrell,\r\none of Richard's officers, the two young princes remained in the\r\nTower, being put to death by their Uncle Richard's orders. Thus,\r\natrociously, began the reign of the murderous usurper,\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD THE THIRD.\r\n\r\nThe King kept his first Christmas at Kenilworth Castle, having\r\npreviously visited the city of Coventry, at the festival of _Corpus\r\nChristi_, to see the plays. The accounts of Kenilworth Castle show\r\nthat in 1484 John Beaufitz was paid L20 \"for divers reparacions made\r\nin the Castell of Kyllingworth\" by order of Richard III. At this time,\r\nsays Philip de Comines, \"he was reigning in greater splendour and\r\nauthority than any king of England for the last hundred years.\" The\r\nfollowing year Richard kept Christmas in the great hall at\r\nWestminster, celebrating the festival with great pomp and splendour,\r\nencouraging the recreations usual at the season, and so attentively\r\nobserving the ancient customs that a warrant is entered for the\r\npayment of \"200 marks for certain new year's gifts bought against the\r\nfeast of Christmas.\" The festivities continued without interruption\r\nuntil the day of the Epiphany, when they terminated with an\r\nentertainment of extraordinary magnificence given by the monarch to\r\nhis nobles in Westminster Hall--\"the King himself wearing his crown,\"\r\nare the words of the Croyland historian, \"and holding a splendid feast\r\nin the great hall, similar to that of his coronation.\" \"Little did\r\nRichard imagine that this would be the last feast at which he would\r\npreside--the last time he would display his crown in peace before his\r\nassembled peers.\"[33] An allusion to this Christmas festival, and to\r\nthe King's wicked nature, is contained in a note to Bacon's \"Life of\r\nKing Henry VII.,\" which says: \"Richard's wife was Anne, the younger\r\ndaughter of Warwick the King-maker. She died 16th March, 1485. It was\r\nrumoured that her death was by poison, and that Richard wished to\r\nmarry his niece Elizabeth of York, eldest daughter of Edward IV. It is\r\nsaid that in the festivities of the previous Christmas the Princess\r\nElizabeth had been dressed in robes of the same fashion and colour as\r\nthose of the Queen. Ratcliffe and Catesby, the King's confidants, are\r\ncredited with having represented to Richard that this marriage of so\r\nnear a kinswoman would be an object of horror to the people, and bring\r\non him the condemnation of the clergy.\"\r\n\r\nAt a Christmas festival at Rhedon, in Brittany, Henry of Richmond met\r\nEnglish exiles to the number of 500, and swore to marry Elizabeth of\r\nYork as soon as he should subdue the usurper; and thereupon the exiles\r\nunanimously agreed to support him as their sovereign. On the 1st of\r\nAugust, 1485, Henry set sail from Harfleur with an army of 3,000 men,\r\nand a few days afterwards landed at Milford Haven. He was received\r\nwith manifest delight, and as he advanced through Wales his forces\r\nwere increased to upwards of 6,000 men. Before the close of the month\r\nhe had encountered the royal army and slain the King at Bosworth\r\nField, and by this memorable victory had terminated the terrible Wars\r\nof the Roses and introduced into England a new dynasty.\r\n\r\n    [19] Browning.\r\n\r\n    [20] \"Every-day Book,\" vol. ii. p. 1635.\r\n\r\n    [21] \"Shorter Poems.\"\r\n\r\n    [22] Sir John Froissart's Chronicles of England, France,\r\n    Spain, Portugal, Scotland, Brittany, Flanders, and the\r\n    adjoining countries; translated from the original French,\r\n    at the command of King Henry the Eighth, by John\r\n    Bourchier, Lord Berners.

AND HENRY VIII.\r\n\r\n(1485-1547.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY THE SEVENTH\r\n\r\nWas the son of Edmund Tudor, Earl of Richmond, son of Owen Tudor, a\r\nWelsh gentleman who had married the widow of Henry V. His mother,\r\nMargaret, was a great-granddaughter of John of Gaunt by Catherine\r\nSwynford. In early life Henry was under the protection of Henry VI.;\r\nbut after the battle of Tewkesbury he was taken by his uncle, Jasper\r\nTudor, Earl of Pembroke, to Brittany for safety. Edward IV. made\r\nseveral unsuccessful attempts to get him into his power, and Richard\r\nIII. also sent spies into Brittany to ascertain his doings. On\r\nChristmas Day, 1483, the English exiles, who gathered round Henry in\r\nBrittany, took an oath in the Cathedral of Rheims to support him in\r\nousting Richard and succeeding him to the English throne. Henry, on\r\nhis part, agreed to reconcile the contending parties by marrying\r\nElizabeth of York, eldest daughter and co-heir of Edward IV., and this\r\npromise he faithfully kept. After his defeat of Richard the Third at\r\nBosworth he assumed the royal title, advanced to London, and had\r\nhimself crowned King of England; and at the following Christmas\r\nfestival he married Elizabeth of York. The Archbishop who married them\r\n(Archbishop Bourchier) had crowned both Richard III. and Henry VII.,\r\nand Fuller quaintly describes this last official act of marrying King\r\nHenry to Elizabeth of York as the holding of \"the posie on which the\r\nWhite Rose and the Red Rose were tied together.\" And Bacon says, \"the\r\nso-long-expected and so-much-desired marriage between the King and the\r\nLady Elizabeth was celebrated with greater triumph and demonstrations,\r\nespecially on the people's part, of joy and gladness, than the days\r\neither of his entry or coronation.\"\r\n\r\nThe Christmas festivities were attended to with increasing zest during\r\nthe reign of Henry VII., for the King studied magnificence quite as\r\nmuch as his predecessors had done. His riding dress was \"a doublet of\r\ngreen or white cloth of gold satin, with a long gown of purple velvet,\r\nfurred with ermine, powdered, open at the sides, and purpled with\r\nermine, with a rich sarpe (scarf) and garter.\" His horse was richly\r\ncaparisoned, and bore a saddle of estate, covered with gold. His\r\nMajesty was attended by seven henchmen, clothed in doublets of crimson\r\nsatin, with gowns of white cloth of gold. The Queen appeared with\r\nequal splendour, \"wearing a round circle of gold, set with pearls and\r\nprecious stones, arrayed in a kirtle of white damask cloth of gold,\r\nfurred with miniver pure, garnished, having a train of the same, with\r\ndamask cloth of gold, furred with ermine, with a great lace, and two\r\nbuttons and tassels of white silk, and gold at the breast above.\" And\r\nthe royal apartments were kept with great splendour. At his ninth\r\nChristmas festival (Dec. 31, 1494) the King established new rules for\r\nthe government of the royal household (preserved among the Harleian\r\nMSS.), which he directed should be kept \"in most straightest wise.\"\r\nThe Royal Household Book of the period, in the Chapter-house at\r\nWestminster, contains numerous disbursements connected with Christmas\r\ndiversions. In the seventh year of this reign is a payment to Wat Alyn\r\n(Walter Alwyn) in full payment for the disguising made at Christmas,\r\nL14 13s. 4d., and payments for similar purposes occur in the following\r\nyears. Another book, also in the Chapter-house, called \"The Kyng's\r\nboke of paymentis,\" contains entries of various sums given to players\r\nand others who assisted to amuse the King at Christmas, and among the\r\nrest, to the Lord of Misrule (or Abbot as he is sometimes called), for\r\nseveral years, \"in rewarde for his besynes in Crestenmes holydays, L6\r\n13s. 4d.\" The plays at this festival seem to have been acted by the\r\n\"gentlemen of the King's Chapell,\" as there are several liberal\r\npayments to certain of them for playing on Twelfth Night; for\r\ninstance, an entry on January 7th, 23 Henry VII., of a reward to five\r\nof them of L6 13s. 4d., for acting before the King on the previous\r\nnight; but there was a distinct set of players for other times.\r\n\r\nLeland, speaking of 1489, says: \"This Cristmas I saw no disgysyngs,\r\nand but right few plays. But ther was an Abbot of Misrule, that made\r\nmuch sport and did right well his office.\" In the following year,\r\nhowever, \"on neweres day at nyght, there was a goodly disgysyng,\" and\r\n\"many and dyvers pleyes.\"\r\n\r\nThat the Christmas festival did not pass unobserved by the men of this\r\nperiod who navigated the high seas we know from the name of a Cuban\r\nport which was\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHRISTMAS DISCOVERY BY CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Day, 1492, Christopher Columbus, the celebrated Genoese\r\nnavigator, landed at a newly-discovered port in Cuba, which he named\r\nNavidad, because he landed there on Christmas Day.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRE AT THE ROYAL RESIDENCE, SHENE,\r\n\r\nwas the event of Christmas, 1497. It broke out in the palace,\r\non the evening of December 21st, while the royal family were\r\nthere, and for three hours raged fiercely, destroying, with the\r\nfairest portion of the building, the rich furniture, beds, tapestry,\r\nand other decorations of the principal chambers. Fortunately\r\nan alarm was given in time, and the royal and noble personages\r\nof the Court escaped to a place of safety. In consequence of\r\nthis fire the King built the fine new palace of Richmond.\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL CHRISTMASES\r\n\r\nwere kept by Henry VII. at Westminster Hall with great hospitality,\r\nthe King wearing his crown, and feasting numerous guests, loading the\r\nbanquet-table with peacocks, swans, herons, conger, sturgeon, brawn,\r\nand all the delicacies of the period. At his ninth Christmas festival\r\nthe Mayor and Aldermen of London were feasted with great splendour at\r\nWestminster, the King showing them various sports on the night\r\nfollowing in the great hall, which was richly hung with tapestry:\r\n\"which sports being ended _in the morning_, the king, queen, and court\r\nsat down at a table of stone, to 120 dishes, placed by as many knights\r\nand esquires, while the Mayor was served with twenty-four dishes and\r\nabundance of wine. And finally the King and Queen being conveyed with\r\ngreat lights into the palace, the Mayor, with his company in barges,\r\nreturned to London by break of the next day.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the ancient records of the Royal Household it appears that on the\r\nmorning of New Year's Day, the King \"sitting in his foot-sheet,\"\r\nreceived according to prescribed ceremony a new year's gift from the\r\nQueen, duly rewarding the various officers and messengers, according\r\nto their rank. The Queen also \"sat in her foot-sheet,\" and received\r\ngifts in the same manner, paying a less reward. And on this day, as\r\nwell as on Christmas Day, the King wore his kirtle, his surcoat and\r\nhis pane of arms; and he walked, having his hat of estate on his head,\r\nhis sword borne before him, with the chamberlain, steward, treasurer,\r\ncomptroller, preceding the sword and the ushers; before whom must walk\r\nall the other lords except those who wore robes, who must follow the\r\nKing. The highest nobleman in rank, or the King's brother, if present,\r\nto lead the Queen; another of the King's brothers, or else the Prince,\r\nto walk with the King's train-bearer. On Twelfth Day the King was to\r\ngo \"crowned, in his royal robes, kirtle, and surcoat, his furred hood\r\nabout his neck, and his ermines upon his arms, of gold set full of\r\nrich stones with balasses, sapphires, rubies, emeralds, and pearls.\"\r\nThis ornament was considered so sacred, that \"no temporal man\" (none\r\nof the laity) but the King was to presume to touch it; an esquire of\r\nthe body was to bring it in a fair handkerchief, and the King was to\r\nput it on with his own hands; he must also have his sceptre in his\r\nright hand, the ball with the cross in his left hand, and must offer\r\nat the altar gold, silver, and incense, which offering the Dean of the\r\nChapel was to send to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and this was to\r\nentitle the Dean to the next vacant benefice. The King was to change\r\nhis mantle when going to meat, and to take off his hood and lay it\r\nabout his neck, \"clasping it before with a rich _owche_.\" The King and\r\nthe Queen on Twelfth Night were to take the _void_ (evening repast) in\r\nthe hall; as for the wassail, the steward and treasurer were to go for\r\nit, bearing their staves; the chapel choir to stand on the side of the\r\nhall, and when the steward entered at the hall door he was to cry\r\nthree times, \"Wassail! Wassail! Wassail!\" and the chapel to answer\r\nwith a good song; and when all was done the King and Queen retired to\r\ntheir chamber.\r\n\r\nAmong the special features of the banquets of this period were the\r\ndevices for the table called subtleties, made of paste, jelly, or\r\nblanc-mange, placed in the middle of the board, with labels describing\r\nthem; various shapes of animals were frequent; and on a saint's day,\r\nangels, prophets, and patriarchs were set upon the table in plenty.\r\nCertain dishes were also directed as proper for different degrees of\r\npersons; as \"conies parboiled, or else rabbits, for they are better\r\nfor a lord\"; and \"for a great lord take squirrels, for they are better\r\nthan conies\"; a whole chicken for a lord; and \"seven mackerel in a\r\ndish, with a dragge of fine sugar,\" was also a dish for a lord. But\r\nthe most famous dish was \"the peacock enkakyll, which is foremost in\r\nthe procession to the king's table.\" Here is the recipe for this royal\r\ndish: Take and flay off the skin with the feathers, tail, and the neck\r\nand head thereon; then take the skin, and all the feathers, and lay it\r\non the table abroad, and strew thereon ground cinnamon; then take the\r\npeacock and roast him, and baste him with raw yolks of eggs; and when\r\nhe is roasted, take him off, and let him cool awhile, and take him and\r\nsew him in his skin, and gild his comb, and so serve him with the last\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARD-PLAYING WAS FORBIDDEN EXCEPT AT CHRISTMAS,\r\n\r\nby a statute passed in the reign of Henry VII. A Scotch writer,[34]\r\nreferring to this prohibition, says: \"A universal Christmas custom of\r\nthe olden time was playing at cards; persons who never touched a card\r\nat any other season of the year felt bound to play a few games at\r\nChristmas. The practice had even the sanction of the law. A\r\nprohibitory statute of Henry VII.'s reign, forbade card-playing save\r\nduring the Christmas holidays. Of course, this prohibition extended\r\nonly to persons of humble rank; Henry's daughter, the Princess\r\nMargaret, played cards with her suitor, James IV. of Scotland; and\r\nJames himself kept up the custom, receiving from his treasurer, at\r\nMelrose, on Christmas Night, 1496, thirty-five unicorns, eleven French\r\ncrowns, a ducat, a _ridare_, and a _leu_, in all about equal to L42 of\r\nmodern money, to use at the card-table.\" Now, as the Scottish king was\r\nnot married to the English princess until 1503, it is quite clear that\r\nhe had learned to play cards long before his courtship with Margaret;\r\nfor in 1496, when he received so much card-money from his treasurer,\r\nthe English princess was but seven years of age. James had evidently\r\nlearned to play at cards with the Scottish barons who frequented his\r\nfather's Court, and whose lawlessness led to the revolt which ended in\r\nthe defeat and melancholy fate of James III. (1488), and gave the\r\nsuccession to his son, James IV., at the early age of fifteen years.\r\nThe no less tragic end of James IV. at Flodden Field, in 1513, is\r\nstrikingly depicted by Sir Walter Scott, who tells:--\r\n\r\n \"Of the stern strife, and carnage drear,\r\n    Of Flodden's fatal field,\r\n  Where shiver'd was fair Scotland's spear,\r\n    And broken was her shield.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF HENRY THE EIGHTH.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Henry VII., who had given England peace and\r\nprosperity, and established firmly his own house on the English\r\nthrone, in 1509, his son Henry became king as Henry VIII. He was a\r\nhandsome and accomplished young man, and his accession was an occasion\r\nof great rejoicing. Henry kept his first\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL CHRISTMAS AT RICHMOND,\r\n\r\nwith great magnificence. Proclaimed king on the 22nd of April at the\r\nage of eighteen, and married on the 3rd of June to Katherine of\r\nArragon, widow of his deceased brother Arthur, Prince of Wales, the\r\nyouthful Monarch and his Queen were afterwards crowned at Westminster\r\nAbbey by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and spent the first Christmas\r\nof their wedded life at Richmond. \"And a very pleasant time it ought\r\nto have been to the Queen, for every species of entertainment was\r\nthere got up by the handsome young king and his gallant company of\r\ncourtiers, for her particular gratification. There was a grand\r\ntournament on the green, before the palace, which was rendered\r\nbrilliant with pavilions, and the other gay structures always erected\r\nfor these chivalrous ceremonies. The King and Queen took their places\r\nin the customary elevated position, surrounded by the nobles and\r\nbeauties of the Court, to witness the feats of arms of the many\r\ngallant knights who had thronged to display their prowess before their\r\nsovereign; these, with their esquires, the heralds, pages, and other\r\nattendants, mounted and on foot, clad in their gay apparel, the\r\nknights wearing handsome suits of armour, and careering on gaily\r\ncaparisoned horses, made a very inspiriting scene, in which the\r\ninterest deepened when the usual combats between individuals or select\r\ncompanies commenced.\"[35]\r\n\r\n \"For every knight that loved chivalry,\r\n  And would his thanks have a passant name,\r\n  Hath prayed that he might be of that game,\r\n  And well was him that thereto chosen was.\"[36]\r\n\r\nThe spectacle presented was one of great splendour; for \"the\r\ncommencement of the reign of Henry VIII., who was then styled by his\r\nloving subjects 'the rose without a thorn,' witnessed a remarkable\r\nrevival of magnificence in personal decoration. So brilliant were the\r\ndresses of both sexes at the grand entertainment over which the King\r\nand Queen presided at Richmond, that it is difficult to convey an\r\nadequate idea of their splendour. But in the first half of the\r\nsixteenth century the principal Courts of Europe were distinguished by\r\na similar love of display, which, though it fostered habits of luxury,\r\nafforded an extraordinary impulse towards art.\"[37] In England the\r\nlove of finery became so general among the people that several\r\nstatutes were passed during Henry's reign to restrain it. But while\r\nthe King was quite willing that his subjects should observe due\r\npropriety in regard to their own dress and adornments, not exceeding\r\nthe regulations laid down for their particular rank or station in\r\nlife, he was lavish in his own expenditure, and it pleased the people\r\nto see Henry dressed in kingly fashion. He greatly increased his own\r\npopularity by taking part in the tournaments, in which \"he did\r\nexceedingly well\"; and he also assisted in the several curious and\r\npicturesque masques of Christmastide.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion the King with some of the chief nobles of his Court\r\nappeared apparelled as Robin Hood and his foresters, in which disguise\r\nhe entered unexpectedly into the Queen's chamber, \"whereat,\" says\r\nHolinshed, \"the Queen and her ladies were greatly amazed, as well for\r\nthe strange sight as for the sudden appearance.\"\r\n\r\nThe splendour of the Court festivities necessitated\r\n\r\n\r\nINCREASED EXPENDITURE FOR CHRISTMAS-KEEPING,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding that the King's domestic affairs were managed by \"a\r\ngood number of honourable, virtuous, wise, expert, and discreet\r\npersons of his Council.\" The preserved bills of fare show that the\r\nCourt diet was liberal generally, but especially sumptuous at the\r\ngrand entertainments of Christmas. And the Royal Household Accounts\r\nalso show increased expenditure for the diversions, as well as for the\r\nbanquetings, of the festival. For instance, the payments to the Lord\r\nof Misrule, which in Henry the Seventh's time never exceeded L6 13s.\r\n4d., were raised by Henry the Eighth in his first year to L8 6s. 8d.,\r\nand subsequently to L15 6s. 8d. In the first year is a payment to \"Rob\r\nAmadas upon his bill for certain plate of gold stuf bought of him for\r\nthe disguisings,\" L451 12s. 2d.; and another to \"Willm. Buttry upon\r\nhis bill for certen sylks bought of him for the disguisings,\" L133 7s.\r\n5d. In the sixth year are charges \"To Leonard Friscobald for diverse\r\nvelvets, and other sylks, for the disguising,\" L247 12s. 7d.; and \"To\r\nRichard Gybson for certen apparell, &c., for the disguysing at the\r\nfest of Cristemes last,\" L137 14s. 1/2d. Considerable payments are\r\nmade to the same Gybson in after years for the same purpose,\r\nparticularly in the eleventh, for revels, called a Maskelyn. In the\r\ntenth year large rewards were given to the gentlemen and children of\r\nthe King's Chapel; the former having L13 6s. 8d. \"for their good\r\nattendance in Xtemas\"; and \"Mr. Cornisse for playing affore the King\r\nopon newyeres day at nyght with the children,\" L6 13s. 4d.\r\n\r\nHall, in his Chronicle, Henry VIII. folio 15b, 16a, gives the\r\nfollowing account of a\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL MASQUERADE AT GREENWICH,\r\n\r\nwhere the King was keeping his Christmas in 1512: \"On the daie of the\r\nEpiphanie, at night, the King with XI others, wer disguised after the\r\nmaner of Italie, called a maske, a thing not seen afore in England;\r\nthei were appareled in garments long and brode, wrought all with gold,\r\nwith visers and cappes of gold; and after the banket doen, these\r\nmaskers came in with six gentlemen disguised in silke, bearing staffe\r\ntorches, and desired the ladies to daunce: some were content, and some\r\nthat new the fashion of it refused, because it was a thing not\r\ncommonly seen. And after thei daunced and communed together, as the\r\nfashion of the maske is, thei tooke their leave and departed, and so\r\ndid the quene and all the ladies.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1521 the King kept his Christmas at Greenwich \"with great nobleness\r\nand open court,\" and again in 1525. In 1527, he received the French\r\nEmbassy here, and also kept his Christmas \"with revels, masks,\r\ndisguisings, and banquets royal;\" as he did again in 1533, in 1537,\r\nand in 1543; the last-mentioned year \"he entertained twenty-one of the\r\nScottish nobility whom he had taken prisoners at Salom Moss, and gave\r\nthem their liberty without ransom.\"[38]\r\n\r\nOn all these occasions Henry diverted his guests right royally,\r\nspending vast sums on the masques and disguisings; but none of the\r\nChristmas diversions proved greater attractions than\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KING'S TOURNAMENT DISPLAYS.\r\n\r\nTo these splendid exercises Henry gave unremitting attention, and not\r\nto display proficiency in them was almost to lose his favour; yet some\r\ndiscretion was required to rival, but not to excel the King, whose\r\nardent temper could not brook superiority in another. But, although\r\nvictory was always reserved for royalty, it is but fair to allow that\r\nthe King was no mean adept in those pursuits for which his bodily\r\npowers and frequent exercise had qualified him.\r\n\r\nAmong the most distinguished Knights of Henry's Court Charles Brandon\r\nwas pre-eminent, not only for his personal beauty and the elegance\r\nthat attended every movement which the various evolutions of the game\r\nrequired, but for his courage, judgment, and skill, qualities which he\r\ndisplayed to great advantage at the royal festivities. This celebrated\r\nman was the son of Sir William Brandon, who, bearing the standard of\r\nHenry the Seventh, was slain by Richard the Third at Bosworth Field.\r\nThree sons of the Howard family were also distinguished at the royal\r\ntournaments. Lord Thomas Howard was one of the most promising\r\nwarriors, and, unfortunately, one of the most dissolute men at the\r\nCourt of Henry. Sir Edward and Sir Edmund Howard, the one famed for\r\nnaval exploits, the other less remarkable, but not without celebrity\r\nfor courage. Sir Thomas Knevet, Master of the Horse, and Lord Neville,\r\nbrother to the Marquis of Dorset, were also prominent in the lists of\r\ncombat. The trumpets blew to the field the fresh, young gallants and\r\nnoblemen, gorgeously apparelled with curious devices of arts and of\r\nembroideries, \"as well in their coats as in trappers for their horses;\r\nsome in gold, some in silver, some in tinsel, and divers others in\r\ngoldsmith's work goodly to behold.\" Such was the array in which the\r\nyoung knights came forth at Richmond, in the splendid tournament which\r\nimmediately succeeded Henry's coronation, \"assuming the name and\r\ndevices of the knights or scholars of Pallas, clothed in garments of\r\ngreen velvet, carrying a crystal shield, on which was pourtrayed the\r\ngoddess Minerva, and had the bases and barbs of their horses\r\nembroidered with roses and pomegranates of gold; those of Diana were\r\ndecorated with the bramble-bush, displayed in a similar manner. The\r\nprize of valour was the crystal shield. Between the lists the\r\nspectators were amused with a pageant, representing a park enclosed\r\nwith pales, containing fallow deer, and attended by foresters and\r\nhuntsmen. The park being moved towards the place where the queen sat,\r\nthe gates were opened, the deer were let out, pursued by greyhounds,\r\nkilled and presented by Diana's champions to the Queen and the ladies.\r\nThus were they included in the amusement, not only as observers, but\r\nas participators; nor were the populace without their share of\r\nenjoyments; streams of Rhenish wine and of claret, which flowed from\r\nthe mouths of animals sculptured in stone and wood, were appropriated\r\nto their refreshment. Night closed on the joyous scene; but before its\r\napproach the King, perceiving that the ardour of the combatants had\r\nbecome intemperate and dangerous, wisely limited the number of\r\nstrokes, and closed the tourney.\r\n\r\n\"It was about this period that the tournament ceased to be merely a\r\nchivalric combat; and, united with the pageant, acquired more of the\r\ndramatic character. The pageant consisted of a temporary building,\r\nmoved on biers, generally representing castles, rocks, mountains,\r\npalaces, gardens, or forests. The decoration of these ambulating\r\nscenes was attended with considerable expense, but was seldom\r\nconducted with taste or consistency. They generally contained figures,\r\npersonating a curious medley of nymphs, savages, heathen gods, and\r\nChristian saints, giants and the nine worthies, who descended and\r\ndanced among the spectators.\r\n\r\n\"On the night of the Epiphany (1516) a pageant was introduced into the\r\nhall at Richmond, representing a hill studded with gold and precious\r\nstones, and having on its summit a tree of gold, from which hung roses\r\nand pomegranates. From the declivity of the hill descended a lady\r\nrichly attired, who, with the gentlemen, or, as they were then called,\r\nchildren of honour, danced a morris before the King.\r\n\r\n\"On another occasion, in the presence of the Court, an artificial\r\nforest was drawn in by a lion and an antelope, the hides of which were\r\nrichly embroidered with golden ornaments; the animals were harnessed\r\nwith chains of gold, and on each sat a fair damsel in gay apparel. In\r\nthe midst of the forest, which was thus introduced, appeared a gilded\r\ntower, at the gates of which stood a youth, holding in his hands a\r\ngarland of roses, as the prize of valour in a tournament which\r\nsucceeded the pageant.\"[39]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS FESTIVITIES OF NOBLEMEN AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nThe royal magnificence was imitated by the nobility and gentry of the\r\nperiod, who kept the Christmas festival with much display and\r\nprodigality, maintaining such numerous retinues as to constitute a\r\nminiature court. The various household books that still exist show the\r\nstate in which they lived. From that of the Northumberland family\r\n(1512), it appears that the \"Almonar\" was often \"a maker of\r\nInterludys,\" and had \"a servaunt to the intent for writynge the\r\nparts.\" The persons on the establishment of the Chapel performed plays\r\nfrom some sacred subject during Christmas; as \"My lorde usith and\r\naccustomyth to gyf yerely, if his lordship kepe a chapell and be at\r\nhome, them of his lordschipes chapell, if they doo play the Play of\r\nthe Nativitie uppon Cristynmes day in the mornnynge in my lords\r\nchapell befor his lordship, xxs.\" Other players were also permitted\r\nand encouraged, and a Master of the Revells appointed to superintend.\r\nAnd \"My lorde useth and accustomyth yerly to gyf hym which is ordynede\r\nto be Master of the Revells yerly in my lordis hous in Cristmas for\r\nthe overseyinge and orderinge of his lordschips Playes, Interludes,\r\nand Dresinge that is plaid befor his lordship in his hous in the XII\r\ndayes of Christenmas, and they to have in rewarde for that caus yerly,\r\nxxs.\" Another entry shows that 13s. 4d. was the price paid to the\r\nchaplain, William Peres, in the 17th Henry VIII., \"for makyng an\r\nEnterlued to be playd this next Christenmas.\"\r\n\r\nIn this reign the working classes were allowed greater privileges at\r\nChristmas than at any other part of the year. The Act of 11 Henry VII.\r\nc. 2, against unlawful games, expressly forbids Artificers, Labourers,\r\nServants, or Apprentices, to play at any such games, except at\r\nChristmas, and then only in their masters' houses by the permission of\r\nthe latter; and a penalty of 6s. 8d. was incurred by any householder\r\nallowing such games, except during those holidays; which, according to\r\nStow, extended from All-hallows evening to the day after Candlemas\r\nDay. The Act of 33 Henry VIII. c. 9, enacts more particularly, \"That\r\nno manner of Artificer or Craftsman of any handicraft or occupation,\r\nHusbandman, Apprentice, Labourer, Servant at husbandry, Journeyman, or\r\nServant of Artificer, Mariners, Fishermen, Watermen, or any\r\nServing-man, shall from the said feast of the Nativity of _St. John\r\nBaptist_, play at the Tables, Tennis, Dice, Cards, Bowls, Clash,\r\nCoyting, Logating, or any other unlawful Game, out of _Christmas_,\r\nunder the pain of xxs. to be forfeit for every time; and in\r\n_Christmas_ to play at any of the said Games in their Masters' houses,\r\nor in their Masters' presence.\"\r\n\r\nIn his description of the \"mummings and masquerades\" of this period,\r\nStrutt[40] says that the \"mummeries\" practised by the lower classes\r\nof the people usually took place at the Christmas holidays; and such\r\npersons as could not procure masks rubbed their faces over with soot,\r\nor painted them; hence Sebastian Brant, in his \"Ship of Fools\"\r\n(translated by Alexander Barclay, and printed by Pynson, in 1508)\r\nalluding to this custom, says:\r\n\r\n \"The one hath a visor ugley set on his face,\r\n    Another hath on a vile counterfaite vesture,\r\n  Or painteth his visage with fume in such case,\r\n    That what he is, himself is scantily sure.\"\r\n\r\nSandys,[41] in reference to this period, says: \"The lower classes,\r\nstill practising the ceremonies and superstitions of their\r\nforefathers, added to them some imitations of the revelries of their\r\nsuperiors, but, as may be supposed, of a grosser description; and many\r\nabuses were committed. It was, therefore, found necessary by an Act\r\npassed in the 3rd year of Henry VIII. to order that no person should\r\nappear abroad like mummers, covering their faces with vizors, and in\r\ndisguised apparel, under pain of three months' imprisonment; and a\r\npenalty of 20s. was declared against such as kept vizors in their\r\nhouse for the purpose of mumming. It was not intended, however, to\r\ndebar people from proper recreations during this season, but, on the\r\ncontrary, we have reason to believe that many indulgencies were\r\nafforded them, and that landlords and masters assisted them with the\r\nmeans of enjoying the customary festivities; listening to their tales\r\nof legendary lore, round the yule block, when weary of more boisterous\r\nsports, and encouraging them by their presence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nKING HENRY VIII.'S \"STILL CHRISTMAS.\"\r\n\r\nIn the 17th year of his reign, in consequence of the prevalence of the\r\nplague in London, the King kept his Christmas quietly in the old\r\npalace at Eltham, whence it was called the \"still Christmas.\" This\r\nsuppression of the mirth and jollity which were the usual concomitants\r\nof the festive season did not satisfy the haughty Cardinal Wolsey, who\r\n\"laye at the Manor of Richemond, and there kept open householde, to\r\nlordes, ladies, and all other that would come, with plaies and\r\ndisguisyng in most royall maner; whiche sore greved the people, and in\r\nespeciall the Kynges servauntes, to se hym kepe an open Court and the\r\nKyng a secret Court.\"[42]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROYAL CHRISTMASES\r\n\r\nsubsequently kept, however, made amends for the cessation of\r\nfestivities at the Kyng's \"Still Christmas,\" especially the royal\r\ncelebrations at Greenwich. In 1527 the \"solemne Christmas\" held there\r\nwas \"with revels, maskes, disguisings, and banquets; and on the\r\nthirtieth of December and the third of January were solemne Justs\r\nholden, when at night the King and fifteen other with him, came to\r\nBridewell, and there putting on masking apparell, took his barge, and\r\nrowed to the Cardinall's (Woolsey) place, where were at supper many\r\nLords and Ladyes, who danced with the maskers, and after the dancing\r\nwas made a great Banquet.\"[43]\r\n\r\nDuring the girlhood of the Princess (afterwards Queen) Mary,\r\nentertainments were given for her amusement, especially at\r\nChristmastide; and she gave presents to the King's players, the\r\nchildren of the Chapel, and others. But, Sandys says, that \"as she\r\ngrew up, and her temper got soured, she probably lost all enjoyment of\r\nsuch scenes.\" Ellis, in his \"Original Letters,\" gives a curious\r\napplication from the Council for the household of the Lady Mary to the\r\nCardinal Wolsey, to obtain his directions and leave to celebrate the\r\nensuing Christmas. In this letter the reader is reminded of the long\r\ntrain of sports and merriment which made Christmas cheerful to our\r\nancestors. The Cardinal, at the same time that he established a\r\nhousehold for the young Duke of Richmond, had also \"ordained a\r\ncouncil, and stablished another household for the Lady Mary, then\r\nbeing _Princess of the Realm_.\"[44] The letter which seems to have\r\nbeen written in the same year in which the household was established,\r\n1525, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Please it youre Grace for the great repaire of straungers supposed\r\nunto the Pryncesse honorable householde this solempne fest of\r\nCristmas, We humbly beseche the same to let us knowe youre gracious\r\npleasure concernyng as well a ship of silver for the almes disshe\r\nrequysite for her high estate, and spice plats, as also for trumpetts\r\nand a rebek to be sent, and whither we shall appoynte any Lord of\r\nMysrule for the said honorable householde, provide for enterluds,\r\ndisgysyngs, or pleyes in the said fest, or for banket on twelf nyght.\r\nAnd in likewise whither the Pryncesse shall sende any newe yeres gifts\r\nto the Kinge, the Quene, your Grace, and the Frensshe Quene, and of\r\nthe value and devise of the same.

Bromley\r\n                                   Thomas Audeley.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS AND THE REFORMATION.\r\n\r\nThe great Reformer, Martin Luther, took much interest in the\r\nfestivities of Christmastide, including, of course, the\r\nChristmas-tree. One of his biographers[45] tells how young Luther,\r\nwith other boys of Mansfeld, a village to the north-west of Eisleben,\r\nsang Christmas carols \"in honour of the Babe of Bethlehem.\" And the\r\nsame writer says, \"Luther may be justly regarded as the central\r\nrepresentative of the Reformation in its early period, for this among\r\nother reasons--that he, more powerfully than any other, impressed upon\r\nthe new doctrine the character of glad tidings of great joy.\" On\r\nChristmas Day, 1521, Martin Luther \"administered the communion in both\r\nkinds, and almost without discrimination of applicants,\" in the parish\r\nchurch of Eisenach, his \"beloved town.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARTIN LUTHER AND THE CHRISTMAS TREE.]\r\n\r\nIn England, the desire for some reform in the Church was recognised\r\neven by Cardinal Wolsey, who obtained from the Pope permission to\r\nsuppress thirty monasteries, and use their revenues for educational\r\npurposes; and Wolsey's schemes of reform might have progressed further\r\nif Henry VIII. had not been fascinated by Anne Boleyn. But the King's\r\namour with the \"little lively brunette\" precipitated a crisis in the\r\nrelations between Church and State.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LITTLE ORLEANS MADONNA OF RAPHAEL]\r\n\r\nHenry, who, by virtue of a papal dispensation, had married his\r\nbrother's widow, Katherine, now needed papal consent to a divorce,\r\nthat he might marry Anne Boleyn, and when he found that he could not\r\nobtain it, he resolved to be his own Pope, \"sole protector and supreme\r\nhead of the Church and clergy of England.\" And among the events of\r\nChristmastide may be mentioned the resolution of the King's minister,\r\nThomas Cromwell, and his party, in 1533, to break the ecclesiastical\r\nconnection with Rome, and establish an independent Church in England.\r\nThe necessary Bills were framed and introduced to Parliament soon\r\nafter the Christmas holidays by Cromwell, who for his successful\r\nservices was made Chancellor of the Exchequer for life. Authority in\r\nall matters ecclesiastical, as well as civil, was vested solely in the\r\nCrown, and the \"courts spiritual\" became as thoroughly the King's\r\ncourts as the temporal courts at Westminster. The enslavement of the\r\nclergy, the dissolution of the monasteries, and the gagging of the\r\npulpits followed, the years of Cromwell's administration being an\r\nEnglish reign of terror. But the ruthless manner in which he struck\r\ndown his victims sickened the English people, and they exhibited their\r\ndisapprobation in a manner which arrested the attention of the King.\r\nThe time of Cromwell himself was coming, for the block was the goal to\r\nwhich Henry's favourite minister was surely hastening; and it is only\r\nanticipating events by very few years, to say that he was beheaded on\r\nTower Hill, July 28, 1540.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER ROYAL CHRISTMAS.\r\n\r\nThat following the execution of Anne Boleyn (1536), Henry spent in the\r\ncompany of his third Queen, Jane Seymour, at Richmond Palace, with a\r\nmerry party, and subsequently crossed the frozen Thames to Greenwich.\r\nDuring the following summer the Queen went with her husband on a\r\nprogress, and in the autumn retired to Hampton Court, where she gave\r\nbirth to a son (who became Edward VI.), and died twelve days\r\nafterwards, on the 14th of October, 1537.\r\n\r\nDuring the married life of Queen Jane, the Princess Mary was often\r\nwith the Court at Richmond, affecting affectionate attachment for the\r\nQueen, apparently to conciliate her father. The birth of a prince,\r\nfollowed by the death of the queen, it might have been thought would\r\nhave a chastening effect upon Mary, as somewhat altering her\r\nprospects; but after acting as chief mourner to her friendly\r\nstepmother, she spent a pleasant Christmas at Richmond, where she\r\nremained till February. Her losses at cards during the Christmas\r\nfestivities were very considerable, for she was fond of gambling. And\r\nshe appears to have also amused herself a good deal with her\r\nattendant, \"Jane the Fool,\" to whose maintenance she contributed while\r\nstaying at Richmond. One curious entry in the Household Book of the\r\nPrincess Mary is: \"Item, for shaving Jane fooles hedde, iiiid.\"\r\nAnother is: \"Item, geven Heywood, playeng an enterlude with his\r\nchildren before my Ladye's grace xls.\"\r\n\r\nThe great event of Christmas, 1539, was\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LANDING OF ANNE OF CLEVES,\r\n\r\nat Deal, on the 27th of December. King Henry had become alarmed at the\r\ncombination between France and Spain, and his unprincipled Chancellor,\r\nCromwell, desirous of regaining his lost influence with the King,\r\nrecommended a Protestant marriage. He told Henry that Anne, daughter\r\nof John III., Duke of Cleves, was greatly extolled for her beauty and\r\ngood sense, and that by marrying her he would acquire the friendship\r\nof the Princes of Germany, in counterpoise to the designs of France\r\nand Spain. Henry despatched Hans Holbein to take the lady's portrait,\r\nand, being delighted with the picture produced, soon concluded a\r\ntreaty of marriage, and sent the Lord Admiral Fitzwilliam, Earl of\r\nSouthampton, to receive the Princess at Calais, and conduct her to\r\nEngland. On her arrival Henry was greatly disappointed. He did not\r\nthink the Princess as charming as her portrait; and, unfortunately for\r\nher, she was unable to woo him with winning words, for she could speak\r\nno language but German, and of that Henry did not understand a word.\r\nThough not ugly (as many contemporaries testify), she was plain in\r\nperson and manners, and she and her maidens, of whom she brought a\r\ngreat train, are said to have been as homely and awkward a bevy as\r\never came to England in the cause of Royal matrimony. The Royal\r\nBluebeard, who had consorted with such celebrated beauties as Anne\r\nBoleyn and Jane Seymour, recollecting what his queens had been, and\r\nwhat Holbein and Cromwell had told him should again be, entered the\r\npresence of Anne of Cleves with great anticipation, but was\r\nthunderstruck at the first sight of the reality. Lord John Russell,\r\nwho was present, declared \"that he had never seen his highness so\r\nmarvellously astonished and abashed as on that occasion.\" The marriage\r\nwas celebrated on the 6th of January, 1540, but Henry never became\r\nreconciled to his German queen; and he very soon vented his anger upon\r\nCromwell for being the means of bringing him, not a wife, but \"a great\r\nFlanders mare.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS AT THE COLLEGES.\r\n\r\nThe fine old tower of Magdalen College, embowered in verdure (as\r\nthough decorated for Christmas), is one of the most picturesque of the\r\nvenerable academical institutions of Oxford. It stands on the east\r\nside of the Cherwell, and is the first object of interest to catch the\r\neye of the traveller who enters the city from the London Road. This\r\ncollege was the scene of many Christmas festivities in the olden time,\r\nwhen it was the custom of the several colleges to elect a \"Christmas\r\nLord, or Lord of Misrule, styled in the registers _Rex Fabarum_ and\r\n_Rex Regni Fabarum_; which custom continued till the Reformation of\r\nReligion, and then that producing Puritanism, and Puritanism\r\nPresbytery, the profession of it looked upon such laudable and\r\ningenious customs as Popish, diabolical and anti-Christian.\"[46]\r\nQueen's College, Oxford (whose members have from time immemorial been\r\ndaily summoned to dine in hall by sound of trumpet, instead of by\r\nbell as elsewhere), is noted for its ancient Christmas ceremony of\r\nushering in the boar's head with the singing of the famous carol--\r\n\r\n     \"_Caput afri differo\r\n      Reddens laudes Domino._\r\n  The boar's head in hand bring I,\r\n  With garlands gay and rosemary,\r\n  I pray you all sing merrily\r\n      _Qui estis in convivio_.\"\r\n\r\nTradition says that this old custom commemorates the deliverance of a\r\nstudent of the college, who, while walking in the country, studying\r\nAristotle, was attacked by a wild boar from Shotover Forest, whereupon\r\nhe crammed the philosopher down the throat of the savage, and thus\r\nescaped from its tusks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAGDALEN COLLEGE, OXFORD.]\r\n\r\nWarton[47] mentions that, \"in an original draught of the Statutes of\r\nTrinity College, at Cambridge, founded in 1546, one of the chapters is\r\nentitled _De Praefecto Ludorum qui Imperator dicitur_, under whose\r\ndirection and authority Latin Comedies and Tragedies are to be\r\nexhibited in the hall at Christmas. With regard to the peculiar\r\nbusiness and office of Imperator it is ordered that one of the Masters\r\nof Arts shall be placed over the juniors, every Christmas, for the\r\nregulation of their games and diversions at that season of festivity.\r\nAt the same time, he is to govern the whole society in the hall and\r\nchapel, as a republic committed to his special charge by a set of laws\r\nwhich he is to frame in Latin and Greek verse. His sovereignty is to\r\nlast during the twelve days of Christmas, and he is to exercise the\r\nsame power on Candlemas.\" His fee amounted to forty shillings. Similar\r\ncustoms were observed at other colleges during Christmastide. In a\r\nsubsequent chapter of this work will be found an account of a grand\r\nexhibition of the Christmas Prince, at St. John's College, Oxford, in\r\nthe year 1607.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRINGING IN THE BOAR'S HEAD WITH MINSTRELSY.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS AT THE INNS OF COURT AND GREAT HOUSES.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Henry the Eighth the Christmases at the Inns of Court\r\nbecame celebrated, especially those at Lincoln's Inn, which had kept\r\nthem as early as the reign of Henry VI. The Temples and Gray's Inn\r\nafterwards disputed the palm with it. Every Corporation appointed a\r\nLord of Misrule or Master of Merry Disports, and, according to Stow,\r\nthere was the like \"in the house of every nobleman of honour or good\r\nworship, were he spiritual or temporal.\" And during the period of the\r\nsway of the Lord of Misrule, \"there were fine and subtle disguisings,\r\nmasks, and mummeries, with playing at cards for counters, nails, and\r\npoints in every house, more for pastime than for gain.\" Town and\r\ncountry would seem to have vied with each other as to which should\r\nexhibit the greatest extravagance in the Christmas entertainments, but\r\n(as in the days of Massinger the poet), the town carried off the\r\npalm:--\r\n\r\n            \"Men may talk of country Christmasses--\r\n  Their thirty-pound buttered eggs, their pies of carps' tongues,\r\n  Their pheasants drenched with ambergris, the carcases\r\n  Of three fat wethers bruised for gravy; to\r\n  Make sauce for a single peacock; yet their feasts\r\n  Were fasts, compared with the city's.\"\r\n\r\nThe earliest particular account of the regulations for conducting one\r\nof these grand Christmases is in the 9th of Henry VIII.,[48] when,\r\nbesides the King for Christmas Day, the Marshal and the Master of the\r\nRevels, it is ordered that the King of Cockneys, on Childermas Day,\r\nshould sit and have due service, and \"that Jack Straw, and all his\r\nadherents, should be thenceforth utterly banished, and no more to be\r\nused in this house, upon pain to forfeit for every time five pounds,\r\nto be levied on every fellow hapning to offend against this rule.\"\r\n\"Jack Straw\" was a kind of masque, which was very much disliked by the\r\naristocratic and elder part of the community, hence the amount of the\r\nfine imposed. The Society of Gray's Inn, however, in 1527, got into a\r\nworse scrape than permitting Jack Straw and his adherents, for they\r\nacted a play (the first on record at the Inns of Court) during this\r\nChristmas, the effect whereof was, that Lord Governance was ruled by\r\nDissipation and Negligence, by whose evil order Lady Public Weal was\r\nput from Governance. Cardinal Wolsey, conscience-smitten, thought this\r\nto be a reflection on himself, and deprived the author, Sergeant Roe,\r\nof his coif, and committed him to the Fleet, together with Thomas\r\nMoyle, one of the actors, until it was satisfactorily explained to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIt was found necessary from time to time to make regulations to limit\r\nthe extent of these revels and plays, and to provide for the expenses,\r\nwhich were considerable, and they were therefore not performed every\r\nyear. In 1531 the Lincoln's Inn Society agreed that if the two Temples\r\nkept Christmas, they would also do so, not liking to be outdone. And\r\nlater an order was made in Gray's Inn that no Comedies, commonly\r\ncalled Interludes, should be acted in the refectory in the intervals\r\nof vacation, except at the celebration of Christmas; and that then the\r\nwhole body of students should jointly contribute towards the dresses,\r\nscenes, and decorations.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the Christmas hospitality of the period, we refer to\r\nthe establishment of John Carminow, whose family was of high repute in\r\nthe county of Cornwall in the time of Henry the Eighth. Hals says that\r\n\"he kept open house for all comers and goers, drinkers, minstrells,\r\ndancers, and what not, during the Christmas time, and that his usual\r\nallowance of provision for those twelve days, was twelve fat bullocks,\r\ntwenty Cornish bushels of wheat (_i.e._, fifty Winchesters),\r\nthirty-six sheep, with hogs, lambs, and fowls of all sort, and drink\r\nmade of wheat and oat-malt proportionable; for at that time\r\nbarley-malt was little known or used in those parts.\"\r\n\r\nThat the beneficed clergy of this period also \"made merry\" with their\r\nparishioners is quite clear from the writings of \"Master Hugh\r\nLatimer,\" who, in Henry's reign, held the benefice of West Kington, in\r\nWiltshire. A citation for heresy being issued against Latimer, he\r\nwrote with his peculiar medley of humour and pathos: \"I intend to make\r\nmerry with my parishioners this Christmas, for all the sorrow, lest\r\nperchance I may never return to them again.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most celebrated personages of this period was\r\n\r\n\r\nWILL SOMERS, THE KING'S JESTER.\r\n\r\nThis famous fool enlivened the Christmas festivities at the Court of\r\nHenry the Eighth, and many quaint stories are told of his drolleries\r\nand witticisms. Though a reputed fool, his sarcastic wit and sparkling\r\ntalents at repartee won him great celebrity. Very little is known of\r\nhis actual biography, but some interesting things are told about him\r\nin a scarce tract, entitled \"A pleasant History of the Life and Death\r\nof Will Somers,\" &c. (which was first published in 1676, and a great\r\npart of which is said to have been taken from Andrew Borde's\r\ncollection of \"The Merry Jests and Witty Shifts of Scoggin\"). \"And now\r\nwho but Will Sommers, the King's Fool? who had got such an interest in\r\nhim by his quick and facetious jests, that he could have admittance to\r\nhis Majesty's Chamber, and have his ear, when a great nobleman, nay, a\r\nprivy counsellor, could not be suffered to speak with him: and\r\nfarther, if the King were angry or displeased with anything, if no man\r\nelse durst demand the cause of his discontent, then was Will Sommers\r\nprovided with one pleasant conceit or another, to take off the edge of\r\nhis displeasure. Being of an easy and tractable disposition he soon\r\nfound the fashions of the court, and obtained a general love and\r\nnotice of the nobility; for he was no carry-tale, nor flattering\r\ninsinuator to breed discord and dissension, but an honest, plain,\r\ndownright [man], that would speak home without halting, and tell the\r\ntruth of purpose to shame the devil--so that his plainness, mixed with\r\na kind of facetiousness, and tartness with pleasantry, made him\r\nacceptable into the company of all men.\" There cannot, perhaps, be a\r\ngreater proof of the estimation in which Somers was held by King\r\nHenry, than the circumstance of his portrait having been twice\r\nintroduced into the same piece with that of the King; once in the fine\r\npicture by Holbein of Henry VIII. and his family, and again, in an\r\nilluminated Psalter which was expressly written for the King, by John\r\nMallard, his chaplain and secretary (\"_Regis Orator et Calamo_\"), and\r\nis now preserved in the British Museum. According to an ancient\r\ncustom, there is prefixed to Psalm lii., \"_dixit incipens_\" in the\r\nPsalter, a miniature illumination of King David and a Fool, whose\r\nfigures, in this instance, are portraits of Henry VIII. and his\r\nfavourite Will Somers. The King is seated at a kind of altar table,\r\nand playing on the harp, whilst Somers who is standing near him, with\r\nhis hands clasped over his breast, appears to listen with admiration.\r\nThe King wears a round flat cap, furred, and a vest of imperial purple\r\nstriped with gold, and fluted at bottom; his doublet is red, padded\r\nwith white; his hose crimson; on his right leg is a blue garter.\r\nSomers is in a vest, with a hood thrown over the back; his stockings\r\nare blue; at his girdle is a black pouch.\r\n\r\nWhen Henry VIII. became old and inactive, his Christmases grew\r\ngradually duller, until he did little more than sit out a play or two,\r\nand gamble with his courtiers, his Christmas play-money requiring a\r\nspecial draught upon the treasury, usually for a hundred pounds.

Which\r\ngentleman so well supplied his office, both in show of sundry sights\r\nand devices of rare inventions, and in act of diverse interludes, and\r\nmatters of pastime plaied by persons, as not onlie satisfied the\r\ncommon sort, but also were verie well liked and allowed by the\r\nCouncell, and other of skill in the like pastimes; but best of all by\r\nthe young King himselfe, as appeered by his princelie liberalitie in\r\nrewarding that service.\" The old chronicler quaintly adds, that\r\n\"Christmas being thus passed with much mirth and pastime, it was\r\nthought now good to proceed to the execution of the judgment against\r\nthe Duke of Somerset.\" The day of execution was the 22nd of January,\r\n1552, six weeks after the passing of the sentence.\r\n\r\nKing Edward took part in some of the Christmas masques performed at\r\nhis Court, with other youths of his age and stature, all the\r\nperformers being suitably attired in costly garments. Will Somers also\r\nfigured in some of these masques. The young King seems to have found\r\nmore amusement in the pageants superintended by Master Ferrers than he\r\nhad gained from some of the solemnities of the state in which he had\r\nbeen obliged to play a prominent part; but none of the diversions\r\nrestored him to good health. Large sums of money were expended on\r\nthese Christmas entertainments, and the King handsomely rewarded the\r\nMaster of his pastimes.\r\n\r\nGeorge Ferrers, who was a lawyer, a poet, and an historian, was\r\ncertainly well qualified for his task, and well supplied with the\r\nmeans of making sport, as \"Master of the King's Pastimes.\" He\r\ncomplained to Sir Thomas Cawarden that the dresses provided for his\r\nassistants were not sufficient, and immediately an order was given for\r\nbetter provision. He provided clowns, jugglers, tumblers, men to dance\r\nthe fool's dance, besides being assisted by the \"Court Fool\" of the\r\ntime--John Smyth. This man was newly supplied for the occasion, having\r\na long fool's coat of yellow cloth of gold, fringed all over with\r\nwhite, red, and green velvet, containing 71/2 yards at L2 per yard,\r\nguarded with plain yellow cloth of gold, 4 yards at 33s. 4d. per yard;\r\nwith a hood and a pair of buskins of the same figured gold containing\r\n21/2 yards at L5, and a girdle of yellow sarsenet containing one\r\nquarter 16d., the whole value of \"the fool's dress\" being L26 14s. 8d.\r\nFerrers, as the \"Lord of Misrule\" wore a robe of rich stuff made of\r\nsilk and golden thread containing 9 yards at 16s. a yard, guarded with\r\nembroidered cloth of gold, wrought in knots, 14 yards at 11s. 4d. a\r\nyard; having fur of red feathers, with a cape of camlet thrum. A coat\r\nof flat silver, fine with works, 5 yards at 50s., with an embroidered\r\ngarb of leaves of gold and coloured silk, containing 15 yards at 20s.\r\na yard. He wore a cap of maintenance, hose buskins, panticles of\r\nBruges satin, a girdle of yellow sarsenet with various decorations,\r\nthe cost of his dress being L52 8s. 8d., which, considering the\r\nrelative value of money, must be considered a very costly dress.\r\n\r\nThe office which George Ferrers so ably filled had been too often held\r\nby those who possessed neither the wit nor the genius it required;\r\nbut, originally, persons of high rank and ability had been chosen to\r\nperform these somewhat difficult duties. Ferrers received L100 for the\r\ncharges of his office; and afterwards the Lord Mayor, who probably had\r\nbeen at the Royal festival, entertained him in London. The cost of the\r\nRoyal festivities exceeded L700.\r\n\r\nStowe, in his \"Annals,\" thus refers to the celebration: \"The King kept\r\nhis Christmasse with open houshold at Greenwich, George Ferrers,\r\nGentleman of Lincolnes Inne, being Lord of the merry Disports all the\r\n12 dayes, who so pleasantly and wisely behaved himselfe, that the King\r\nhad great delight in his pastimes. On Monday the fourth of January,\r\nthe said Lord of Merry Disports came by water to London, and landed at\r\nthe Tower-wharfe, entered the Tower, and then rode through the\r\nTower-streete, where he was received by Sergeant Vawce, Lord of\r\nMisrule to John Mainard, one of the Sheriffes of London, and so\r\nconducted through the Citie with a great company of young Lords and\r\ngentlemen, to the house of Sir George Barne, Lord Maior; where he,\r\nwith the chiefe of his company dined, and after had a great banquet;\r\nand, at his departure, the Lord Maior gave him a standing cup, with a\r\ncover of silver and gilt, of the value of ten pounds, for a reward;\r\nand also set a hogs-head of wine, and a barrell of beere, at his\r\ngate, for his traine that followed him; the residue of his gentlemen\r\nand servants dined at other Aldermen's houses, and with the sheriffes,\r\nand so departed to the Tower wharfe againe, and to the Court by water,\r\nto the great commendation of the Maior and Aldermen, and highly\r\naccepted of the King and Councell.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIGIOUS MATTERS\r\n\r\noccupied public attention throughout the reign of Edward VI.\r\nThe young king was willing to support the reforming projects of\r\nArchbishop Cranmer, and assented to the publication of the new Liturgy\r\nin the Prayer Book of 1549, and the Act of Uniformity. And with the\r\nsanction of the sovereign, Cranmer, in 1552, issued a revised Liturgy,\r\nknown as the Second Prayer Book of King Edward VI., and the Forty-two\r\nArticles, which were markedly Protestant in tendency. On his health\r\nfailing, the King, acting on the advice of the Duke of Northumberland,\r\naltered the settlement of the crown as arranged in the will of Henry\r\nVIII., and made a will excluding Mary and Elizabeth from the\r\nsuccession in favour of Lady Jane Grey, daughter-in-law of\r\nNorthumberland, which was sanctioned by Archbishop Cranmer and the\r\nPrivy Council. Although Cranmer had sanctioned this act with great\r\nreluctance, and on the assurance of the judges, it sufficed to secure\r\nhis condemnation for high treason on Mary's accession. Edward sank\r\nrapidly and died on July 6, 1553.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Northumberland then\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAIMED LADY JANE GREY QUEEN,\r\n\r\nbut the people refused to recognise the usurpation. After a brief\r\nreign of eleven days,\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CROWN WAS TRANSFERRED TO MARY,\r\n\r\ndaughter of Henry VIII. and Catherine of Arragon, and Lady Jane Grey\r\nand her husband were sent to the Tower, and subsequently condemned to\r\ndeath. They were kept in captivity for some time, and were not\r\nexecuted until after Wyatt's rebellion in 1554.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Virgin & Child, Chirbury.]\r\n\r\nMary was a firm Roman Catholic, and she looked to her uncle, Charles\r\nV. of Spain, for assistance and support. In January, 1554, much to the\r\ndisappointment of her subjects, she concluded a treaty of marriage\r\nwith Philip of Spain, son of Charles V. Afterwards her reign was\r\ndisturbed by insurrections, and also by the persecution of Protestants\r\nby Cardinal Pole, who came over to England to push forward the Roman\r\nCatholic reaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS TROUBLED REIGN\r\n\r\nwas not congenial to Christmas festivities, though they were still\r\nkept up in different parts of the country. During the Christmas\r\nfestival (January 2, 1554) a splendid embassy, sent by the Emperor,\r\nCharles the Fifth, headed by the Counts Egmont and Lalain, the Lord of\r\nCourrieres, and the Sieur de Nigry, landed in Kent, to arrange the\r\nmarriage between Queen Mary and Philip. The unpopularity of the\r\nproceeding was immediately manifested, for the men of Kent, taking\r\nEgmont for Philip, rose in fury and would have killed him if they\r\ncould have got at him. Although an attempt was made to allay the fears\r\nof the English, within a few days three insurrections broke out in\r\ndifferent parts of the kingdom, the most formidable being that under\r\nSir Thomas Wyatt, who fixed his headquarters at Rochester. In city and\r\ncourt alike panic prevailed. The lawyers in Westminster Hall pleaded\r\nin suits of armour hidden under their robes, and Dr. Weston preached\r\nbefore the Queen in Whitehall Chapel, on Candlemas Day, in armour\r\nunder his clerical vestments. Mary alone seemed calm and\r\nself-possessed. She mounted her horse, and, attended by her ladies and\r\nher Council, rode into the City, where, summoning Sir Thomas White,\r\nLord Mayor, and the Aldermen, who all came clad in armour under their\r\ncivic livery, she ascended a chair of State, and with her sceptre in\r\nher hand addressed them, declaring she would never marry except with\r\nthe leave of her Parliament. Her courage gained the day. The rebellion\r\nwas speedily quelled and the ringleaders put to death; and the\r\nfollowing July the marriage took place. Mary's subsequent reign was a\r\n\"reign of terror, a time of fire and blood, such as has no parallel in\r\nthe history of England.\"[49]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS DIVERSIONS OF QUEEN MARY.\r\n\r\nDuring her \"reign of terror\" Queen Mary was diverted by Christmas\r\nplays and pageants, and she showed some interest in the amusements of\r\nthe people. Strutt's \"Sports and Pastimes,\" in an article on the\r\n\"Antiquity of Tumbling,\" says: \"It would seem that these artists were\r\nreally famous mirth-makers; for one of them had the address to excite\r\nthe merriment of that solemn bigot Queen Mary. 'After her Majesty,'\r\nobserves Strype, 'had reviewed the royal pensioners in Greenwich Park,\r\nthere came a tumbler, and played many pretty feats, the Queen and\r\nCardinal Pole looking on; whereat she was observed to laugh\r\nheartily.'\" Strutt also mentions that \"when Mary visited her sister,\r\nthe Princess Elizabeth, during her confinement at Hatfield House, the\r\nnext morning, after mass, a grand exhibition of bear-baiting was made\r\nfor their amusement, with which, it is said, 'their highnesses were\r\nright well content.'\" The idle pageantry of the Boy-bishop, which had\r\nbeen formally abrogated by proclamation from the King, in the\r\nthirty-third year of Henry VIII., was revived by his daughter Mary.\r\nStrutt says that \"in the second year of her reign an edict, dated\r\nNovember 13, 1554, was issued from the Bishop of London to all the\r\nclergy of his diocese, to have a Boy-bishop in procession. The year\r\nfollowing, 'the child Bishop, of Paules Church, with his company,'\r\nwere admitted into the Queen's privy chamber, where he sang before her\r\non Saint Nicholas Day, and upon Holy Innocents Day. After the death of\r\nMary this silly mummery was totally discontinued.\"\r\n\r\nThe Christmas entertainments of Philip and Mary at Richmond are thus\r\ndescribed by Folkstone Williams:[50] \"The Queen strove to entertain\r\nher Royal husband with masques, notwithstanding that he had seen many\r\nfair and rich beyond the seas; and Nicholas Udall, the stern\r\nschoolmaster, was ordered to furnish the drama. An idea of these\r\nperformances may be gathered from the properties of a masque of\r\npatrons of gallies like Venetian senators with galley-slaves for their\r\ntorch-bearers, represented at Court in Christmas of the first and\r\nsecond years of Philip and Mary, with a Masque of six Venuses, or\r\namorous ladies, with six Cupids, and as many torch-bearers. Among them\r\nwere lions' heads, sixteen other headpieces, made in quaint fashion\r\nfor the Turkish magistrates, as well as eight falchions for them, the\r\nsheaths covered with green velvet, and bullioned with copper. There\r\nwere eight headpieces for women-masks, goddesses and huntresses. A\r\nmasque of eight mariners, of cloth of gold and silver, and six pairs\r\nof chains for the galley slaves. Another mask of goddesses and\r\nhuntresses, with Turks, was performed on the following Shrovetide; and\r\none of six Hercules, or men of war, coming from the sea with six\r\nMariners to their torch-bearers, was played a little later. Besides\r\nwhich, we find mention of a masque of covetous men with long noses--a\r\nmasque of men like Argus--a masque of women Moors--a masque of\r\nAmazons--one of black and tawney tinsel, with baboons' faces--one of\r\nPolanders, and one of women with Diana hunting.\"\r\n\r\nNichols (\"Progresses,\" vol. i. p. 18) says that in 1557 the Princess\r\nElizabeth was present at a Royal Christmas kept with great solemnity\r\nby Queen Mary and King Philip at Hampton Court. \"On Christmas Eve, the\r\ngreat hall of the palace was illuminated with a thousand lamps\r\ncuriously disposed. The Princess supped at the same table in the hall\r\nwith the King and Queen, next the cloth of state; and after supper,\r\nwas served with a perfumed napkin and plates of confects by the Lord\r\nPaget. But she retired to her ladies before the revels, maskings, and\r\ndisguisings began. On St. Stephen's day she heard mattins in the\r\nQueen's closet adjoining to the chapel, where she was attired in a\r\nrobe of white sattin, strung all over with large pearls. On the 29th\r\nday of December she sate with their majesties and the nobility at a\r\ngrand spectacle of justing, when two hundred spears were broken. Half\r\nof the combatants were accoutred in the Almaine and half in the\r\nSpanish fashion. Thus our chronicler, who is fond of minute\r\ndescription. But these and other particularities, insignificant as\r\nthey seem, which he has recorded so carefully, are a vindication of\r\nQueen Mary's character in the treatment of her sister; they prove that\r\nthe Princess, during her residence at Hatfield, lived in splendour and\r\naffluence; that she was often admitted to the diversions of the Court;\r\nand that her present situation was by no means a state of oppression\r\nand imprisonment, as it has been represented by most of our\r\nhistorians.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Saints and angels.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROMISH PRIESTLY PRACTICES\r\n\r\non \"Christmass-daye,\" at this period, are referred to in the\r\nfollowing translation from Naogeorgus, by Barnaby Googe:--\r\n\r\n \"Then comes the day wherein the Lorde did bring his birth to passe;\r\n  Whereas at midnight up they rise, and every man to Masse,\r\n  This time so holy counted is, that divers earnestly\r\n  Do think the waters all to wine are chaunged sodainly;\r\n  In that same houre that Christ Himselfe was borne, and came to light,\r\n  And unto water streight againe transformde and altred quight.\r\n  There are beside that mindfully the money still do watch,\r\n  That first to aultar commes, which then they privily do snatch.\r\n  The priestes, least other should it have, take oft the same away,\r\n  Whereby they thinke throughout the yeare to have good lucke in play,\r\n  And not to lose: then straight at game till day-light do they strive,\r\n  To make some present proofe how well their hallowde pence wil thrive.\r\n  Three Masses every priest doth singe upon that solemn day,\r\n  With offrings unto every one, that so the more may play.\r\n  This done, a woodden childe in clowtes is on the aultar set,\r\n  About the which both boyes and gyrles do daunce and trymly jet;\r\n  And Carrols sing in prayse of Christ, and, for to helpe them heare,\r\n  The organs aunswere every verse with sweete and solemne cheare.\r\n  The priestes do rore aloude; and round about the parentes stande\r\n  To see the sport, and with their voyce do helpe them and their hande.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTMAS MUMMERS\r\n\r\nplayed a prominent part in the festivities of this period, and the\r\nfollowing illustration shows how they went a-mumming.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RIDING A-MUMMING AT CHRISTMASTIDE.]\r\n\r\nQueen Mary died on November 17, 1558, and her half-sister,\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZABETH, CAME TO THE THRONE\r\n\r\nin perilous times, for plots of assassination were rife, and England\r\nwas engaged on the side of Spain in war with France. But the alliance\r\nwith Spain soon came to an end, for Queen Elizabeth saw that the\r\ndefence of Protestantism at home and peace with France abroad were\r\nnecessary for her own security and the good of her subjects. She began\r\nher reign by regarding the welfare of her people, and she soon won and\r\nnever lost their affection.\r\n\r\nWith the accession of Queen Elizabeth there was a revival of the\r\ncourtly pomp and pageantry which were marked characteristics of her\r\nfather's reign. Just before the Christmas festival (1558) the new\r\nqueen made a state entry into the metropolis, attended by a\r\nmagnificent throng of nobles, ladies, and gentlemen, and a vast\r\nconcourse of people from all the country round. At Highgate she was\r\nmet by the bishops, who kneeled by the wayside and offered their\r\nallegiance. She received them graciously and gave them all her hand to\r\nkiss, except Bonner, whom she treated with marked coldness, on account\r\nof his atrocious cruelties: an intimation of her own intentions on the\r\nscore of religion which gave satisfaction to the people. In the\r\npageantry which was got up to grace her entry into London, a figure\r\nrepresenting \"Truth\" dropped from one of the triumphal arches, and\r\nlaid before the young Queen a copy of the Scriptures. Holinshed says\r\nshe revived the book with becoming reverence, and, pressing it to her\r\nbosom, declared that of all the gifts and honours conferred upon her\r\nby the loyalty of the people this was the most acceptable. Yet\r\nGreen,[51] in describing Elizabeth's reign, says: \"Nothing is more\r\nrevolting in the Queen, but nothing is more characteristic, than her\r\nshameless mendacity. It was an age of political lying, but in the\r\nprofusion and recklessness of her lies Elizabeth stood without a peer\r\nin Christendom.\"\r\n\r\nSir William Fitzwilliam, writing to Mr. More, of Loseley, Surrey, a\r\nfew weeks after the accession of Elizabeth, as an important piece of\r\nCourt news, says: \"You shall understand that yesterday, being\r\nChristmas Day, the Queen's Majesty repaired to her great closet with\r\nher nobles and ladies, as hath been accustomed in such high feasts;\r\nand she, perceiving a bishop preparing himself to mass, all in the old\r\nform, tarried there until the gospel was done, and when all the people\r\nlooked for her to have offered according to the old fashion, she with\r\nher nobles returned again from the closet and the mass, on to her\r\nprivy chamber, which was strange unto divers. Blessed be God in all\r\nHis gifts.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the Christmas festival (1558) preparations went on for the\r\ncoronation of Elizabeth, which was to take place on the 15th of\r\nJanuary. On the 12th of that month she proceeded to the Tower by\r\nwater, attended by the lord mayor and citizens, and greeted with peals\r\nof ordnance, with music and gorgeous pageantry--a marked contrast to\r\nher previous entrance there as a suspected traitor in imminent peril\r\nof her life. Two days later the Queen rode in state from the Tower to\r\nWestminster, \"most honourably accompanied, as well with gentlemen,\r\nbarons, and other the nobility of this realm, as also with a notable\r\ntrain of godly and beautiful ladies, richly appointed,\" and all riding\r\non horseback. The streets through which the procession passed were\r\nadorned with stately pageants, costly decorations, and various\r\nartistic devices, and were crowded with enthusiastic spectators, eager\r\nto welcome their new sovereign, and to applaud \"the signs they noticed\r\nin her of a most prince-like courage, and great readiness of wit.\" On\r\nthe following day (Sunday, the 15th of January) Elizabeth was crowned\r\nin Westminster Abbey, by Dr. Oglethorpe, Bishop of Carlisle, \"Queen of\r\nEngland, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith.\" The ceremonials\r\nof the coronation were regulated according to ancient custom, and the\r\nentertainment in Westminster Hall was on a scale of great\r\nmagnificence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DUMB SHOW IN THE TIME OF ELIZABETH.\r\n(_From Messrs Cassell & Co.'s \"English Plays,\" by permission_)]\r\n\r\nElizabeth was particularly fond of dramatic displays, and her first\r\nRoyal Christmas was celebrated with plays and pageants of a most\r\ncostly description. Complaints, however, being made of the expense of\r\nthese entertainments, she determined to control them, and directed an\r\nestimate to be made in the second year of her reign for the masques\r\nand pastimes to be shown before her at Christmas and Shrovetide. Sir\r\nThomas Cawarden was then, as he had for some time previous been,\r\nMaster of the Revels. According to Collier, the estimate amounted to\r\nL227 11s. 2d., being nearly L200 less than the expenses in the former\r\nyear. The control over the expenses, however, must soon have ceased,\r\nfor in subsequent years the sums were greatly enlarged.\r\n\r\nNichols[52] mentions that on Twelfth Day, 1559, in the afternoon, the\r\nLord Mayor and Aldermen, and all the crafts of London, and the\r\nBachelors of the Mayor's Company, went in procession to St. Paul's,\r\nafter the old custom, and there did hear a sermon. The same day a\r\nstage was set up in the hall for a play; and after the play was over,\r\nthere was a fine mask; and, afterwards, a great banquet which lasted\r\ntill midnight.\r\n\r\nIn this reign a more decorous and even refined style of entertainment\r\nhad usurped the place of the boisterous feastings of former times, but\r\nthere was no diminution in that ancient spirit of hospitality, the\r\nexercise of which had become a part of the national faith. This is\r\nevident from the poems of Thomas Tusser (born 1515--died 1580) and\r\nother writers, who show that the English noblemen and yeomen of that\r\ntime made hospitality a prominent feature in the festivities of the\r\nChristmas season. In his \"Christmas Husbandry Fare,\" Tusser says:--\r\n\r\n \"Good husband and housewife, now chiefly be glad\r\n  Things handsome to have, as they ought to be had,\r\n  They both do provide against Christmas do come,\r\n  To welcome their neighbour, good cheer to have some;\r\n  Good bread and good drink, a good fire in the hall,\r\n  Brawn pudding and souse, and good mustard withal.\r\n\r\n  Beef, mutton, and pork, shred pies of the best,\r\n  Pig, veal, goose, and capon, and turkey well dressed;\r\n  Cheese, apples, and nuts, jolly carols to hear,\r\n  As then in the country is counted good cheer.\r\n\r\n  What cost to good husband is any of this?\r\n  Good household provision only it is;\r\n  Of other the like I do leave out a many,\r\n  That costeth the husbandman never a penny.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAND CHRISTMAS OF THE INNER TEMPLE, 1561-2.\r\n\r\nProfessor Henry Morley[53] says the first English tragedy, \"Gorboduc,\"\r\nwas written for the Christmas festivities of the Inner Temple in the\r\nyear 1561 by two young members of that Inn--Thomas Norton, then\r\ntwenty-nine years old, and Thomas Sackville, then aged twenty-five.\r\nAnd the play was performed at this \"Grand Christmass\" kept by the\r\nmembers of the Inner Temple. Before a \"Grand Christmas\" was kept the\r\nmatter was discussed in a parliament of the Inn, held on the eve of\r\nSt. Thomas's Day, December 21st. If it was resolved upon, the two\r\nyoungest of those who served as butlers for the festival lighted two\r\ntorches, with which they preceded the benchers to the upper end of the\r\nhall. The senior bencher there made a speech; officers were appointed\r\nfor the occasion, \"and then, in token of joy and good liking, the\r\nBench and company pass beneath the hearth and sing a carol.\"[54] The\r\nrevellings began on Christmas Eve, when three Masters of the Revels\r\nsat at the head of one of the tables. All took their places to the\r\nsound of music played before the hearth. Then the musicians withdrew\r\nto the buttery, and were themselves feasted. They returned when dinner\r\nwas ended to sing a song at the highest table. Then all tables were\r\ncleared, and revels and dancing were begun, to be continued until\r\nsupper and after supper. The senior Master of the Revels, after dinner\r\nand after supper, sang a carol or song, and commanded other gentlemen\r\nthere present to join him. This form of high festivity was maintained\r\nduring the twelve days of Christmas, closing on Twelfth Night. On\r\nChristmas Day (which in 1561 was a Thursday), at the first course of\r\nthe dinner, the boar's head was brought in upon a platter, followed by\r\nminstrelsy. On St. Stephen's Day, December the 26th, the Constable\r\nMarshal entered the hall in gilt armour, with a nest of feathers of\r\nall colours on his helm, and a gilt pole-axe in his hand; with him\r\nsixteen trumpeters, four drums and fifes, and four men armed from the\r\nmiddle upward. Those all marched three times about the hearth, and the\r\nConstable Marshal, then kneeling to the Lord Chancellor, made a\r\nspeech, desiring the honour of admission into his service, delivered\r\nhis naked sword, and was solemnly seated. That was the usual\r\nceremonial when a Grand Christmas was kept. At this particular\r\nChristmas, 1561, in the fourth year of Elizabeth, it was Lord Robert\r\nDudley, afterwards Earl of Leicester, who was Constable Marshal, and\r\nwith chivalrous gallantry, taking in fantastic style the name of\r\nPalaphilos, Knight of the Honourable Order of Pegasus, Pegasus being\r\nthe armorial device of the Inner Temple, he contributed to the\r\nsplendour of this part of the entertainment. After the seating of the\r\nConstable Marshal, on the same St. Stephen's Day, December the 26th,\r\nthe Master of the Game entered in green velvet, and the Ranger of the\r\nForest in green satin; these also went three times about the fire,\r\nblowing their hunting-horns. When they also had been ceremoniously\r\nseated, there entered a huntsman with a fox and a cat bound at the end\r\nof a staff. He was followed by nine or ten couple of hounds, who\r\nhunted the fox and the cat to the glowing horns, and killed them\r\nbeneath the fire. After dinner, the Constable Marshal called a\r\nburlesque Court, and began the Revels, with the help of the Lord of\r\nMisrule. At seven o'clock in the morning of St. John's Day, December\r\nthe 27th (which was a Saturday in 1561) the Lord of Misrule was afoot\r\nwith power to summon men to breakfast with him when service had closed\r\nin the church. After breakfast, the authority of this Christmas\r\nofficial was in abeyance till the after-dinner Revels. So the\r\nceremonies went on till the Banqueting Night, which followed New\r\nYear's Day. That was the night of hospitality. Invitations were sent\r\nout to every House of Court, that they and the Inns of Chancery might\r\nsee a play and masque. The hall was furnished with scaffolds for the\r\nladies who were then invited to behold the sports. After the play,\r\nthere was a banquet for the ladies in the library; and in the hall\r\nthere was also a banquet for the Lord Chancellor and invited ancients\r\nof other Houses. On Twelfth Day, the last of the Revels, there were\r\nbrawn, mustard, and malmsey for breakfast after morning prayer, and\r\nthe dinner as on St. John's Day.\r\n\r\nThe following particulars of this \"Grand Christmas\" at the Inner\r\nTemple are from Nichols's \"Progresses of Queen Elizabeth\":--\r\n\r\n\"In the fourth year of Queen Elizabeth's reign there was kept\r\na magnificent Christmas here; at which the Lord Robert Dudley\r\n(afterwards Earl of Leicester) was the chief person (his title\r\nPalaphilos), being Constable and Marshall; whose officers were\r\nas followeth:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Onslow, Lord Chancellour.\r\n  Anthony Stapleton, Lord Treasurer.\r\n  Robert Kelway, Lord Privy Seal.\r\n  John Fuller, Chief Justice of the King's Bench.\r\n  William Pole, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas.\r\n  Roger Manwood, Chief Baron of the Exchequer.\r\n  Mr. Bashe, Steward of the Household.\r\n  Mr. Copley, Marshall of the Household.\r\n  Mr. Paten, Chief Butler.\r\n  Christopher Hatton, Master of the Game.

Thus, as I abode in\r\ndespair, either to return or to continue my former purpose, I chanced\r\nto see coming towards me an honest citizen, clothed in a long garment,\r\nkeeping the highway, seeming to walk for his recreation, which\r\nprognosticated rather peace than perill; of whom I demanded the cause\r\nof this great shot; who friendly answered, \"It is,\" quoth he, \"a\r\nwarning shot to the Constable Marshall of the Inner Temple, to prepare\r\nto dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"'\"Why,\" said I, \"what, is he of that estate that seeketh no other\r\nmeans to warn his officers than with so terrible shot in so peaceable\r\na country?\" \"Marry,\" saith he, \"he uttereth himself the better to be\r\nthat officer whose name he beareth.\"\r\n\r\n\"'I then demanded, \"What province did he govern, that needed such an\r\nofficer?\" He answered me, \"The province was not great in quantity, but\r\nantient in true nobility. A place,\" said he, \"privileged by the most\r\nexcellent Princess the High Governor of the whole Island, wherein are\r\nstore of Gentlemen of the whole Realm, that repair thither to learn to\r\nrule and obey by Law, to yield their fleece to their Prince and\r\nCommonweal; as also to use all other exercises of body and mind\r\nwhereunto nature most aptly serveth to adorn, by speaking,\r\ncountenance, gesture, and use of apparel the person of a Gentleman;\r\nwhereby amity is obtained, and continued, that Gentlemen of all\r\ncountries, in their young years, nourished together in one place, with\r\nsuch comely order, and daily conference, are knit by continual\r\nacquaintance in such unity of minds and manners as lightly never after\r\nis severed, than which is nothing more profitable to the Commonweale.\"\r\n\r\n\"'And after he had told me thus much of honour of the place, I\r\ncommended in mine own conceit the policy of the Governour, which\r\nseemed to utter in itself the foundation of a good Commonweal; for\r\nthat, the best of their people from tender years trained up in\r\nprecepts of justice, it could not choose but yield forth a profitable\r\nPeople to a wise Commonweal; wherefore I determined with myself to\r\nmake proof of what I heard by report.\r\n\r\n\"'The next day I thought of my pastime to walk to this Temple, and\r\nentring in at the gates, I found the building nothing costly; but many\r\ncomely Gentlemen of face and person, and thereto very courteous, saw I\r\nto pass to and fro, so as it seemed a Prince's port to be at hand; and\r\npassing forward, entred into a Church of antient building, wherein\r\nwere many monuments of noble personages armed in knightly habit, with\r\ntheir cotes depainted in ancient shields, whereat I took pleasure to\r\nbehold. Thus gazing as one bereft with the rare sight, there came unto\r\nme an Hereaught, by name Palaphilos, a King of Armes, who courteously\r\nsaluted me, saying, \"For that I was a stranger, and seeming by my\r\ndemeanour a lover of honour, I was his guest of right,\" whose courtesy\r\n(as reason was) I obeyed; answering, \"I was at his commandment.\"\r\n\r\n\"'\"Then,\" said he, \"ye shall go to mine own lodging here within the\r\nPalace, where we will have such cheer as the time and country will\r\nyield us;\" where, I assure you I was so entertained, and no where I\r\nmet with better cheer or company, &c.\r\n\r\n\"'--Thus talking, we entred the Prince his Hall, where anon we heard\r\nthe noise of drum and fyfe. \"What meaneth this drum?\" said I. Quoth\r\nhe, \"This is to warn Gentlemen of the Houshold to repair to the\r\ndresser; wherefore come on with me, and ye shall stand where ye may\r\nbest see the Hall served:\" and so from thence brought me into a long\r\ngallery, that stretched itself along the Hall neer the Prince's table,\r\nwhere I saw the Prince set: a man of tall personage, a manly\r\ncountenance, somewhat brown of visage, strongly featured, and thereto\r\ncomely proportioned in all lineaments of body. At the nether end of\r\nthe same table were placed the Embassadors of sundry Princes. Before\r\nhim stood the carver, sewer, and cupbearer, with great number of\r\ngentlemen-wayters attending his person; the ushers making place to\r\nstrangers, of sundry regions that came to behold the honour of this\r\nmighty Captain. After the placing of these honourable guests, the Lord\r\nSteward, Treasurer, and Keeper of Pallas Seal, with divers honourable\r\npersonages of that Nobility, were placed at a side-table neer\r\nadjoining the Prince on the right hand: and at another table, on the\r\nleft side, were placed the Treasurer of the Houshold, Secretary, the\r\nPrince his Serjeant at the Law, four Masters of the Revels, the King\r\nof Arms, the Dean of the Chappel, and divers Gentlemen Pensioners to\r\nfurnish the same.\r\n\r\n\"'At another table, on the other side, were set the Master of the\r\nGame, and his Chief Ranger, Masters of Houshold, Clerks of the Green\r\nCloth and Check, with divers other strangers to furnish the same.\r\n\r\n\"'On the other side against them began the table, the Lieutenant of\r\nthe Tower, accompanied with divers Captains of foot-bands and shot.\r\nAt the nether end of the Hall began the table, the High Butler, the\r\nPanter, Clerks of the Kitchen, Master Cook of the Privy Kitchen,\r\nfurnished throughout with the souldiers and Guard of the Prince: all\r\nwhich, with number of inferior officers placed and served in the Hall,\r\nbesides the great resort of strangers, I spare to write.\r\n\r\n\"'The Prince so served with tender meats, sweet fruits, and dainty\r\ndelicates confectioned with curious cookery, as it seemed wonder a\r\nworld to observe the provision: and at every course the trumpetters\r\nblew the couragious blast of deadly war, with noise of drum and fyfe,\r\nwith the sweet harmony of violins, sack-butts, recorders, and\r\ncornetts, with other instruments of musick, as it seemed Apollo's harp\r\nhad tuned their stroke.\r\n\r\n\"'Thus the Hall was served after the most ancient order of the Island;\r\nin commendation whereof I say, I have also seen the service of great\r\nPrinces, in solemn seasons and times of triumph, yet the order hereof\r\nwas not inferior to any.\r\n\r\n\"'But to proceed, this Herehaught Palaphilos, even before the second\r\ncourse came in, standing at the high table, said in this manner: \"The\r\nmighty Palaphilos, Prince of Sophie, High Constable Marshall of the\r\nKnights Templars, Patron of the Honourable Order of Pegasus:\" and\r\ntherewith cryeth, \"A Largess.\" The Prince, praysing the Herehaught,\r\nbountifully rewarded him with a chain to the value of an hundred\r\ntalents.\r\n\r\n\"'I assure you I languish for want of cunning ripely to utter that I\r\nsaw so orderly handled appertaining to service; wherefore I cease, and\r\nreturn to my purpose.\r\n\r\n\"'The supper ended, and tables taken up, the High Constable rose, and\r\na while stood under the place of honour, where his achievement was\r\nbeautifully embroidered, and devised of sundry matters, with the\r\nAmbassadors of foreign nations, as he thought good, till Palaphilos,\r\nKing of Armes, came in, his Herehaught Marshal, and Pursuivant before\r\nhim; and after followed his messenger and Calligate Knight; who\r\nputting off his coronal, made his humble obeysance to the Prince, by\r\nwhom he was commanded to draw neer, and understand his pleasure;\r\nsaying to him; in few words, to this effect: \"Palaphilos, seeing it\r\nhath pleased the high Pallas, to think me to demerit the office of\r\nthis place; and thereto this night past vouchsafed to descend from\r\nheavens to increase my further honour, by creating me Knight of her\r\nOrder of Pegasus; as also commanded me to join in the same Society\r\nsuch valiant Gentlemen throughout her province, whose living honour\r\nhath best deserved the same, the choice whereof most aptly belongeth\r\nto your skill, being the watchman of their doings, and register of\r\ntheir deserts; I will ye choose as well throughout our whole armyes,\r\nas elsewhere, of such special gentlemen, as the gods hath appointed,\r\nthe number of twenty-four, and the names of them present us:\r\ncommanding also those chosen persons to appear in our presence in\r\nknightly habit, that with conveniency we may proceed in our purpose.\"\r\nThis done, Palaphilos obeying his Prince's commandement, with\r\ntwenty-four valiant Knights, all apparelled in long white vestures,\r\nwith each man a scarf of Pallas colours, and them presented, with\r\ntheir names, to the Prince; who allowed well his choise, and commanded\r\nhim to do his office. Who, after his duty to the Prince, bowed towards\r\nthese worthy personages, standing every man in his antienty, as he had\r\nborne armes in the field, and began to shew his Prince's pleasure;\r\nwith the honour of the Order.'\"\r\n\r\n\"_Other Particulars touching these Grand Christmasses, extracted\r\nout of the Accompts of the House_.\r\n\r\n\"First, it hath been the duty of the Steward, to provide five fat\r\nbrawns, vessels, wood, and other necessaries belonging to the kitchen:\r\nas also all manner of spices, flesh, fowl, and other cates for the\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\n\"The office of the Chief Butler, to provide a rich cupboard of plate,\r\nsilver and parcel gilt: seaven dozen of silver and gilt spoons: twelve\r\nfair salt-cellers, likewise silver and gilt: twenty candlesticks of\r\nthe like.\r\n\r\n\"Twelve fine large table cloths, of damask and diaper. Twenty dozen of\r\nnapkins suitable at the least. Three dozen of fair large towels;\r\nwhereof the Gentleman Sewers, and Butlers of the House, to have every\r\nof them one at mealtimes, during their attendance. Likewise to provide\r\ncarving knives; twenty dozen of white cups and green potts: a carving\r\ntable; torches; bread, beer, and ale. And the chief of the Butlers was\r\nto give attendance on the highest table in the Hall, with wine, ale\r\nand beer: and all the other Butlers to attend at the other tables in\r\nlike sort.\r\n\r\n\"The cupboard of plate is to remain in the Hall on Christmas Day, St.\r\nStephen's Day and New Year's Day, from breakfast time ended untill\r\nafter supper. Upon the banquetting night it was removed into the\r\nbuttry; which in all respects was very laudably performed.\r\n\r\n\"The office of the Constable Marshall to provide for his employment, a\r\nfair gilt compleat harneys, with a nest of fethers in the helm; a fair\r\npole-axe to bear in his hand, to be chevalrously ordered on Christmas\r\nDay and other days, as afterwards is shewed; touching the ordering and\r\nsettling of all which ceremonies, during the said Grand Christmas, a\r\nsolemn consultation was held at their Parliament in this house; in the\r\nform following:\r\n\r\n\"First, at the Parliament kept in their Parliament Chamber in this\r\nHouse, on the even at night of St. Thomas the Apostle, officers are to\r\nattend, according as they had been long before that time, at a former\r\nParliament named and elected to undergo several offices for this time\r\nof solemnity, honour, and pleasance; of which officers these are the\r\nmost eminent; namely, the Steward, Marshall, Constable Marshall,\r\nButler and Master of the Game. These officers are made known and\r\nelected in Trinity Term next before; and to have knowledg thereof by\r\nletters, in the country, to the end they may prepare themselves\r\nagainst All-Hallow-tide; that, if such nominated officers happen to\r\nfail, others may then be chosen in their rooms. The other officers are\r\nappointed at other times nearer Christmas Day.\r\n\r\n\"If the Steward, or any of the said officers named in Trinity Term,\r\nrefuse or fail, he or they were fined every one, at the discretion of\r\nthe Bench; and the officers aforenamed agreed upon. And at such a\r\nParliament, if it be fully resolved to proceed with such a Grand\r\nChristmas, then the two youngest Butlers must light two torches, and\r\ngo before the Bench to the upper end of the Hall; who being set down,\r\nthe antientest Bencher delivereth a speech briefly, to the whole\r\nsociety of Gentlemen then present, touching their consent as afore:\r\nwhich ended, the eldest Butler is to publish all the officers' names,\r\nappointed in Parliament; and then in token of joy and good-liking, the\r\nBench and Company pass beneath the harth, and sing a carol, and so to\r\nboyer.\r\n\r\n\"_Christmas Eve._--The Marshall at dinner is to place at the highest\r\ntable's end, and next to the Library, all on one side thereof, the\r\nmost antient persons in the company present: the Dean of the Chappel\r\nnext to him; then an antient or Bencher, beneath him. At the other end\r\nof the table, the Sewer, Cup-bearer, and Carver. At the upper end of\r\nthe bench-table, the King's Serjeant and Chief Butler; and when the\r\nSteward hath served in, and set on the table the first mess, then he\r\nis also to sit down.\r\n\r\n\"Also at the supper end of the other table, on the other side of the\r\nHall, are to be placed the three Masters of the Revels; and at the\r\nlower end of the bench-table are to sit, the King's Attorney, the\r\nRanger of the Forest, and the Master of the Game. And at the lower end\r\nof the table, on the other side of the Hall, the fourth Master of the\r\nRevels, the Common Serjeant, and Constable-Marshall. And at the upper\r\nend of the Utter Barrister's table, the Marshal sitteth, when he hath\r\nserved in the first mess; the Clark of the Kitchen also, and the Clark\r\nof the Sowce-tub, when they have done their offices in the kitchen,\r\nsit down. And at the upper end of the Clark's table, the Lieutenant of\r\nthe Tower, and the attendant to the Buttery are placed.\r\n\r\n\"At these two tables last rehersed, the persons they may sit upon both\r\nsides of the table; but of the other three tables all are to sit upon\r\none side. And then the Butlers or Christmas Servants, are first to\r\ncover the tables with fair linnen table-cloths; and furnish them with\r\nsalt-cellers, napkins, and trenchers, and a silver spoon. And then the\r\nButlers of the House must place at the salt-celler, at every the said\r\nfirst three highest tables, a stock of trenchers and bread; and at the\r\nother tables, bread onely without trenchers.\r\n\r\n\"At the first course the minstrels must sound their instruments, and\r\ngo before; and the Steward and Marshall are next to follow together;\r\nand after them the Gentleman Sewer; and then cometh the meat. Those\r\nthree officers are to make altogether three solemn curtesies, at three\r\nseveral times, between the skreen and the upper table; beginning with\r\nthe first at the end of the Bencher's table; the second at the midst;\r\nand the third at the other end; and then standing by the Sewer\r\nperformeth his office.\r\n\r\n\"When the first table is set and served, the Steward's table is next\r\nto be served. After him the Master's table of the Revells; then that\r\nof the Master of the Game. The High Constable-Marshall; then the\r\nLieutenant of the Tower; then the Utter Barrister's table; and lastly\r\nthe Clerk's table; all which time the musick must stand right above\r\nthe harth side, with the noise of their musick; their faces direct\r\ntowards the highest table; and that done, to return into the buttry,\r\nwith their music sounding.\r\n\r\n\"At the second course every table is to be served as at the first\r\ncourse, in every respect; which performed the Servitors and Musicians\r\nare to resort to the place assigned for them to dine at; which is the\r\nValects or Yeoman's table, beneath the skreen. Dinner ended the\r\nmusicians prepare to sing a song, at the highest table: which ceremony\r\naccomplished, then the officers are to address themselves every one in\r\nhis office, to avoid the tables in fair and decent manner, they\r\nbeginning at the Clerk's table; thence proceed to the next; and thence\r\nto all the others till the highest table be solemnly avoided.\r\n\r\n\"Then, after a little repose, the persons at the highest table arise\r\nand prepare to revells: in which time, the Butlers, and other\r\nServitors with them, are to dine in the Library.\r\n\r\n\"At both the doors in the hall are porters, to view the comers in and\r\nout at meal times; to each of them is allowed a cast of bread, and a\r\ncaudle nightly after supper.\r\n\r\n\"At night before supper are revels and dancing, and so also after\r\nsupper during the twelve daies of Christmas. The antientest Master of\r\nthe Revels is, after dinner and supper, to sing a caroll or song; and\r\ncommand other gentlemen then there present to sing with him and the\r\ncompany; and so it is very decently performed.\r\n\r\n\"A repast at dinner is 8d.\r\n\r\n\"_Christmas Day._--Service in the Church ended, the Gentlemen\r\npresently repair into the hall to breakfast, with brawn, mustard and\r\nmalmsey.\r\n\r\n\"At dinner, the Butler appointed for the Grand Christmas, is to see\r\nthe tables covered and furnished: and the Ordinary Butlers of the\r\nHouse are decently to set bread, napkins, and trenchers in good form,\r\nat every table; with spoones and knives.\r\n\r\n\"At the first course is served in a fair and large bore's-head, upon a\r\nsilver platter, with minstralsye. Two Gentlemen in gowns are to\r\nattend at supper, and to bear two fair torches of wax, next before the\r\nMusicians and Trumpetters, and to stand above the fire with the musick\r\ntill the first course be served in through the Hall. Which performed,\r\nthey, with the musick, are to return into the buttery. The like course\r\nis to be observed in all things, during the time of Christmas. The\r\nlike at supper.\r\n\r\n\"At service time, this evening, the two youngest Butlers are to bear\r\ntwo torches _Genealogia_.\r\n\r\n\"A repast at dinner is 12d. which strangers of worth are admitted to\r\ntake in the Hall; and such are to be placed at the discretion of the\r\nMarshall.\r\n\r\n\"_St. Stephen's Day._--The Butler, appointed for Christmas, is to see\r\nthe tables covered, and furnished with salt-sellers, napkins, bread,\r\ntrenchers, and spoons. Young Gentlemen of the House are to attend and\r\nserve till the latter dinner, and then dine themselves.\r\n\r\n\"This day the Sewer, Carver, and Cup-bearer are to serve as afore.\r\nAfter the first course served in, the Constable-Marshall cometh into\r\nthe Hall, arrayed with a fair rich compleat harneys, white and bright,\r\nand gilt, with a nest of fethers of all colours upon his crest or\r\nhelm, and a gilt pole-axe in his hand: to whom is associate the\r\nLieutenant of the Tower, armed with a fair white armour, a nest of\r\nfethers in his helm, and a like pole-axe in his hand; and with them\r\nsixteen Trumpetters; four drums and fifes going in rank before them;\r\nand with them attendeth four men in white harneys, from the middle\r\nupwards, and halberds in their hands, bearing on their shoulders the\r\nTower: which persons, with the drums, trumpets and musick, go three\r\ntimes about the fire. Then the Constable-Marshall, after two or three\r\ncurtesies made, kneeleth down before the Lord Chancellor; behind him\r\nthe Lieutenant; and they kneeling, the Constable-Marshall pronounceth\r\nan oration of a quarter of an hour's length, therby declaring the\r\npurpose of his coming; and that his purpose is to be admitted into his\r\nLordship's service.\r\n\r\n\"The Lord Chancellor saith, 'He will take further advice therein.'\r\n\r\n\"Then the Constable-Marshall, standing up, in submissive manner\r\ndelivereth his naked sword to the Steward; who giveth it to the Lord\r\nChancellor: and thereupon the Lord Chancellor willeth the Marshall to\r\nplace the Constable-Marshall in his seat: and so he doth, with the\r\nLieutenant also in his seat or place. During this ceremony the Tower\r\nis placed beneath the fire.\r\n\r\n\"Then cometh the Master of the Game, apparelled in green velvet, and\r\nthe Ranger of the Forest also, in a green suit of satten; bearing in\r\nhis hand a green bow and divers arrows, with either of them a hunting\r\nhorn about their necks; blowing together three blasts of venery, they\r\npace round about the fire three times. Then the Master of the Game\r\nmaketh three curtesies; as aforesaid; and kneeleth down before the\r\nLord Chancellor, declaring the cause of his coming; and desireth to be\r\nadmitted into his service, &c. All this time the Ranger of the Forest\r\nstandeth directly behind him. Then the Master of the Game standeth up.\r\n\r\n\"This ceremony also performed, a Huntsman cometh into the Hall, with a\r\nfox and a purse-net; with a cat, both bound at the end of a staff; and\r\nwith them nine or ten couple of hounds, with the blowing of hunting\r\nhornes. And the fox and cat are by the hounds set upon, and killed\r\nbeneath the fire. This sport finished the Marshall placeth them in\r\ntheir several appointed places.\r\n\r\n\"Then proceedeth the second course; which done, and served out, the\r\nCommon Serjeant delivereth a plausible speech to the Lord Chancellour,\r\nand his company at the highest table, how necessary a thing it is to\r\nhave officers at this present; the Constable-Marshall and Master of\r\nthe Game, for the better honour and reputation of the Commonwealth;\r\nand wisheth them to be received, &c.\r\n\r\n\"Then the King's Serjeant at Law declareth and inferreth the\r\nnecessity; which heard the Lord Chancellor desireth respite of farther\r\nadvice. Then the antientest of the Masters of the Revels singeth a\r\nsong with the assistance of others there present.\r\n\r\n\"At Supper the Hall is to be served in all solemnity, as upon\r\nChristmas Day, both the first and second course to the highest table.\r\nSupper ended the Constable-Marshall presenteth himself with drums\r\nafore him, mounted upon a scaffold, born by four men; and goeth three\r\ntimes round about the harthe, crying out aloud, 'A Lord, a lord,' &c.\r\nThen he descendeth and goeth to dance, &c. And after he calleth his\r\nCourt every one by name, one by one, in this manner:\r\n\r\n\"Sir _Francis Flatterer_ of _Fowlehurst_, in the county of\r\n_Buckingham_.\r\n\r\n\"Sir _Randle Rakabite_, of _Rascall-Hall_, in the county of\r\n_Rakehell_.\r\n\r\n\"Sir _Morgan Mumchance_, of _Much Monkery_, in the county of _Mad\r\nMopery_.\r\n\r\n\"Sir _Bartholomew Baldbreech_, of _Buttocks-bury_, in the county of\r\n_Brekeneck_.\r\n\r\n\"This done the Lord of Misrule addresseth himself to the banquet;\r\nwhich ended with some minstralsye, mirth and dancing every man\r\ndeparteth to rest.\r\n\r\n\"At every mess is a pot of wine allowed.\r\n\r\n\"Every repast is 6d.\r\n\r\n\"_St. John's Day._--About seaven of the clock in the morning, the Lord\r\nof Misrule is abroad, and if he lack any officer or attendant, he\r\nrepaireth to their chambers, and compelleth them to attend in person\r\nupon him after service in the church, to breakfast, with brawn,\r\nmustard, and malmsey. After breakfast ended, his Lordship's power is\r\nin suspense, until his personal presence at night; and then his power\r\nis most potent.\r\n\r\n\"At dinner and supper is observed the diet and service performed on\r\nSt. Stephen's Day. After the second course served in, the King's\r\nSerjeant, orator-like, declareth the disorder of the\r\nConstable-Marshall, and of the Common-Serjeant: which complaint is\r\nanswered by the Common-Serjeant; who defendeth himself and the\r\nConstable-Marshall with words of great efficacy. Hereto the King's\r\nSerjeant replyeth. They rejoyn, &c., and who so is found faulty is\r\ncommitted to the Tower, &c.\r\n\r\n\"If any officer be absent at dinner or supper times; if it be\r\ncomplained of, he that sitteth in his place is adjudged to have like\r\npunishment as the officer should have had being present: and then\r\nwithal he is enjoyned to supply the office of the true absent officer,\r\nin all pointe. If any offendor escape from the Lieutenant into the\r\nButtery, and bring into the Hall a manchet upon the point of a knife,\r\nhe is pardoned: for the buttry in that case is a sanctuary. After\r\ncheese served to the table not any is commanded to sing.\r\n\r\n\"_Childermas Day._--In the morning, as afore on Monday, the Hall is\r\nserved; saving that the Sewer, Carver, and Cup-bearer, do not attend\r\nany service. Also like ceremony at supper.\r\n\r\n\"_Thursday._--At breakfast, brawn, mustard, and malmsey. At dinner,\r\nroast beef, venison-pasties, with like solemnities as afore. And at\r\nsupper, mutton and hens roasted.\r\n\r\n\"_New Year's Day._--In the morning, breakfast as formerly. At dinner\r\nlike solemnity as on Christmas Eve.\r\n\r\n\"_The Banquetting Night._--It is proper to the Butler's office, to\r\ngive warning to every House of Court, of this banquet; to the end that\r\nthey and the Innes of Chancery, be invited thereto to see a play and\r\nmask. The hall is to be furnished with scaffolds to sit on, for Ladies\r\nto behold the sports, on each side. Which ended the ladyes are to be\r\nbrought into the Library, unto the Banquet there; and a table is to be\r\ncovered and furnished with all banquetting dishes, for the Lord\r\nChancellor, in the Hall; where he is to call to him the Ancients of\r\nother Houses, as many as may be on the one side of the table. The\r\nBanquet is to be served in by the Gentlemen of the House.\r\n\r\n\"The Marshall and Steward are to come before the Lord Chancellour's\r\nmess. The Butlers for Christmas must serve wine; and the Butlers of\r\nthe House beer and ale, &c. When the banquet is ended, then cometh\r\ninto the Hall the Constable-Marshall, fairly mounted on his mule; and\r\ndeviseth some sport for passing away the rest of the night.\r\n\r\n\"_Twelf Day._--At breakfast, brawn, mustard, and malmsey, after\r\nmorning prayer ended. And at dinner, the Hall is to be served as upon\r\nSt. John's Day.\"\r\n\r\n              *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe performance of \"Gorboduc\" at the Inner Temple was received with\r\nsuch great applause, and the services of Lord Robert Dudley, first\r\nfavourite of the Queen, so highly appreciated at that particular\r\n\"grand Christmasse,\" that Queen Elizabeth commanded a repetition of\r\nthe play about a fortnight later, before herself, at her Court at\r\nWhitehall. A contemporary MS. note (Cotton MSS., Vit. F. v.) says of\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERFORMANCE BEFORE THE QUEEN,\r\n\r\nthat \"on the 18th of January, 1562, there was a play in the Queen's\r\nHall at Westminster by the gentlemen of the Temple after a great mask,\r\nfor there was a great scaffold in the hall, with great triumph as has\r\nbeen seen; and the morrow after, the scaffold was taken down.\" An\r\nunauthorised edition of the play was first published, in September of\r\nthat year, by William Griffith, a bookseller in St. Dunstan's\r\nChurchyard; but nine years afterwards an authorised and \"true copy\" of\r\nthe play was published by John Day, of Aldersgate, the title being\r\nthen altered from \"Gorboduc\" (in which name the spurious edition had\r\nbeen issued) to \"Ferrex and Porrex.\" The title of this edition set\r\nforth that the play was \"without addition or alteration, but\r\naltogether as the same was shewed on stage before the Queen's\r\nMajestie, by the gentlemen of the Inner Temple.\" The argument of the\r\nplay was taken from Geoffrey of Monmouth's \"History of British Kings,\"\r\nand was a call to Englishmen to cease from strife among themselves and\r\nbecome an united people, obedient to one undisputed rule:--\r\n\r\n \"Within one land one single rule is best:\r\n  Divided reigns do make divided hearts;\r\n  But peace preserves the country and the prince.\"\r\n\r\nIt recalled the horrors of the civil wars, and forbade the like\r\nagain:--\r\n\r\n \"What princes slain before their timely hour!\r\n  What waste of towns and people in the land!\r\n  What treasons heap'd on murders and on spoils!\r\n  Whose just revenge e'en yet is scarcely ceas'd:\r\n  Ruthful remembrance is yet raw in mind.\r\n  The gods forbid the like to chance again.\"\r\n\r\nA good description of the play, with copious extracts, is published in\r\nMorley's \"English Plays,\" from which it also appears that \"Queen\r\nMary's expenditure on players and musicians had been between two and\r\nthree thousand pounds a year in salaries. Elizabeth reduced this\r\nestablishment, but still paid salaries to interlude players and\r\nmusicians, to a keeper of bears and mastiffs, as well as to the\r\ngentlemen and children of the chapel. The Master of the Children had a\r\nsalary of forty pounds a year; the children had largesse at high\r\nfeasts, and when additional use was made of their services; and each\r\nGentleman of the Chapel had nineteenpence a day, with board and\r\nclothing. The Master of the Chapel who at this time had the training\r\nof the children was Richard Edwards, who had written lighter pieces\r\nfor them to act before her Majesty, and now applied his skill to the\r\nwriting of English comedies, and teaching his boys to act them for the\r\npleasure of the Queen. The new form of entertainment made its way at\r\nCourt and through the country.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FOOL OF THE OLD PLAY.\r\n(_From a Print by Breughel._)]\r\n\r\nAt this period\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTMAS REVELS AT THE INNS OF COURT\r\n\r\nwere observed with much zest and jollity. Sandys (writing in 1833 of\r\nElizabeth's time) says:--\r\n\r\n\"The order of the usual Christmas amusements at the Inns of Court at\r\nthis period would cause some curious scenes if carried into effect in\r\nthe present day. Barristers singing and dancing before the judges,\r\nserjeants and benchers, would 'draw a house' if spectators were\r\nadmitted. Of so serious import was this dancing considered, that by an\r\norder in Lincoln's Inn of February, 7th James I., the under barristers\r\nwere by decimation put out of commons because the whole bar offended\r\nby not dancing on Candlemas Day preceding, according to the ancient\r\norder of the society, when the judges were present; with a threat that\r\nif the fault were repeated, they should be fined or disbarred.\"\r\n\r\nSir William Dugdale makes the following reference to\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTMAS REVELS OF THE INNER TEMPLE:--\r\n\r\n\"First, the solemn Revells (after dinner, and the play ended,) are\r\nbegun by the whole House, Judges, Sergeants at Law, Benchers; the\r\nUtter and Inner Barr; and they led by the _Master of the Revells_: and\r\none of the Gentlemen of the Utter Barr are chosen to sing a song to\r\nthe Judges, Serjeants, or Masters of the Bench; which is usually\r\nperformed; and in default thereof, there may be an amerciament. Then\r\nthe Judges and Benchers take their places, and sit down at the upper\r\nend of the Hall. Which done, the _Utter-Barristers_ and\r\n_Inner-Barristers_, perform a second solemn Revell before them. Which\r\nended, the _Utter-Barristers_ take their places and sit down. Some of\r\nthe Gentlemen of the _Inner-Barr_, do present the House with dancing,\r\nwhich is called the _Post Revells_, and continue their Dances, till\r\nthe Judges or Bench think meet to rise and depart.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HARD FROST OF 1564\r\n\r\ngave the citizens of London an opportunity of keeping Christmas on the\r\nice. An old chronicler says: \"From 21st December, 1564, a hard frost\r\nprevailed, and on new year's eve, people went over and alongst the\r\nThames on the ise from London Bridge to Westminster. Some plaied at\r\nthe football as boldlie there, as if it had been on the drie land;\r\ndivers of the Court, being then at Westminster shot dailie at prickes\r\nset upon the Thames, and tradition says, Queen Elizabeth herself\r\nwalked upon the ise. The people both men and women, went on the Thames\r\nin greater numbers than in any street of the City of London. On the\r\nthird daie of January, 1565, at night it began to thaw, and on the\r\nfifth there was no ise to be seene between London Bridge and Lambeth,\r\nwhich sudden thaw caused great floods, and high waters, that bore\r\ndowne bridges and houses and drowned Manie people in England.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW QUEEN ELIZABETH WENT TO WORSHIP, CHRISTMAS, 1565.\r\n\r\nNichols[55] gives the following particular account of Queen\r\nElizabeth's attendance at Divine worship, at the \"Chappell of\r\nWhitehall, Westminster,\" Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, 1565:--\r\n\r\n\"Item, on Monday, the 24th of December, the Officers of Arms being\r\nthere present, the Queen's Majesty came to the evening prayer, the\r\nsword borne by the Earle of Warwick, her trayn borne by the Lady\r\nStrange.\r\n\r\n\"Item, on Christmas Day her Majesty came to service very richly\r\napparelled in a gown of purple velvet embroidered with silver very\r\nrichly set with stones, with a rich collar set with stones; the Earl\r\nof Warwick bare the sword, the Lady Strange the trayn. After the\r\nCreed, the Queene's Majesty went down to the offering, and having a\r\nshort forme with a carpet, and a cushion laid by a gentleman usher,\r\nthe ... taken by the Lord Chamberlain, her Majesty kneeled down, her\r\noffering given her by the Marquis of Northampton; after which she went\r\ninto her traverse, where she abode till the time of the communion, and\r\nthen came forth, and kneeled down at the cushion and carpet aforesaid;\r\nthe Gentlemen Ushers delivered the towel to the Lord Chamberlain, who\r\ndelivered the same to be holden by the Earl of Sussex on the right\r\nhand, and the Earl of Leicester on the left hand; the Bishop of\r\nRochester served the Queen both of wine and bread; then the Queen went\r\ninto the traverse again; and the Ladie Cicilie, wife of the Marquis of\r\nBaden, came out of the traverse, and kneeled at the place where the\r\nQueen kneeled, but she had no cushion, but one to kneel on; after she\r\nhad received she returned to the traverse again; then the Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury and the Lord Chamberlain received the Communion with the\r\nMother of the Maids; after which the service proceeded to the end, and\r\nthe Queen returned again to the Chamber of presence strait, and not\r\nthe closet. Her Majesty dined not abroad; the said Officers of Arms\r\nhad a mess of meat of seven dishes, with bread, beer, ale, and wine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL CHRISTMASES AT HAMPTON COURT.\r\n\r\nIn 1568, the Earl of Shrewsbury, writing from Hampton Court to his\r\ncountess, says, \"The Plage is disposed far abrode in London, so that\r\nthe Queene kepes hur Kyrsomas her, and goth not to Grenwych as it was\r\nmete.\" Meet or not, Elizabeth kept many Christmases at Hampton Court,\r\nbanqueting, dancing, and dicing--the last being a favourite amusement\r\nwith her, because she generally won, thanks to her dice being so\r\nloaded as to throw up the higher numbers. Writing from Hampton Court\r\nat Christmas, 1572, Sir Thomas Smith says: \"If ye would what we do\r\nhere, we play at tables, dance, and keep Christmasse.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Coat of Arms.]\r\n\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELIZABETH'S SINGERS AND PLAYERS.\r\n\r\nThe Christmas entertainments of Queen Elizabeth were enlivened by the\r\nbeautiful singing of the children of her Majesty's Chapel. From the\r\nnotes to Gascoigne's _Princely Pleasures_ (1821) it appears that Queen\r\nElizabeth retained on her Royal establishment four sets of singing\r\nboys; which belonged to the Cathedral of St. Paul, the Abbey of\r\nWestminster, St. George's Chapel, Windsor, and the Household Chapel.\r\nFor the support and reinforcement of her musical bands, Elizabeth,\r\nlike the other English Sovereigns, issued warrants for taking \"up\r\nsuche apt and meete children, as are fitt to be instructed and framed\r\nin the Art and Science of Musicke and Singing.\" Thomas Tusser, the\r\nwell-known author of \"Five Hundreth Points of Good Husbandrye,\" was in\r\nhis youth a choir boy of St. Paul's. Nor is it astonishing, that\r\nalthough masses had ceased to be performed, the Queen should yet\r\nendeavour to preserve sacred melody in a high state of perfection;\r\nsince, according to Burney, she was herself greatly skilled in musical\r\nlearning. \"If her Majesty,\" says that eminent author, \"was ever able\r\nto execute any of the pieces that are preserved in a MS. which goes\r\nunder the name of Queen Elizabeth's Virginal-book, she must have been\r\na very great player, as some of the pieces which were composed by\r\nTallis, Bird, Giles, Farnaby, Dr. Bull, and others, are so difficult\r\nthat it would be hardly possible to find a master in Europe who would\r\nundertake to play any of them at the end of a month's practice.\"[56]\r\nBut the children of the chapel were also employed in the theatrical\r\nexhibitions represented at Court, for which their musical education\r\nhad peculiarly qualified them. Richard Edwards, an eminent poet and\r\nmusician of the sixteenth century, had written two comedies; Damon and\r\nPythias, and Palemon and Arcite, which, according to Wood, were often\r\nacted before the Queen, both at Court and at Oxford.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ACTING OF ONE OF SHAKESPEARE'S PLAYS IN THE TIME OF\r\nQUEEN ELIZABETH.\r\n(_By permission, from Messrs Cassell & Co's \"Illustrated History of\r\nEngland_\")]\r\n\r\nWith the latter of these Queen Elizabeth was so much delighted that\r\nshe promised Edwards a reward, which she subsequently gave him by\r\nmaking him first Gentleman of her Chapel, and in 1561 Master of the\r\nChildren on the death of Richard Bowyer. As the Queen was particularly\r\nattached to dramatic entertainments, about 1569 she formed the\r\nchildren of the Royal Chapel into a company of theatrical performers,\r\nand placed them under the superintendence of Edwards. Not long after\r\nshe formed a second society of players under the title of the\r\n\"Children of the Revels,\" and by these two companies all Lyly's plays,\r\nand many of Shakespeare's and Jonson's, were first performed. Jonson\r\nhas celebrated one of the chapel children, named Salathiel Pavy, who\r\nwas famous for his performance of old men, but who died about 1601,\r\nunder the age of thirteen. In his beautiful epitaph of Pavy, Jonson\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n \"'Twas a child that did so thrive\r\n    In grace and feature,\r\n  As heaven and nature seem'd to strive\r\n    Which own'd the creature.\r\n  Years he number'd scarce thirteen\r\n    When fates turn'd cruel,\r\n  Yet three fill'd Zodiacs had he been\r\n    The stage's jewel;\r\n  And did act, what now we moan.\r\n    Old men so duly,\r\n  That the Parcoe thought him one\r\n    He played so truly.\"\r\n\r\nThe Shakespearian period had its grand Christmases, for\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTMAS PLAYERS\r\n\r\nat the Court of Queen Elizabeth included England's greatest dramatist,\r\nWilliam Shakespeare; and the Queen not only took delight in witnessing\r\nShakespeare's plays, but also admired the poet as a player. The\r\nhistrionic ability of Shakespeare was by no means contemptible, though\r\nprobably not such as to have transmitted his name to posterity had he\r\nconfined himself exclusively to acting. Rowe informs us that \"the\r\ntip-top of his performances was the ghost in his own _Hamlet_;\" but\r\nAubrey states that he \"did act exceedingly well\"; and Cheetle, a\r\ncontemporary of the poet, who had seen him perform, assures us that he\r\nwas \"excellent in the quality he professed.\" An anecdote is preserved\r\nin connection with Shakespeare's playing before Queen Elizabeth. While\r\nhe was taking the part of a king, in the presence of the Queen,\r\nElizabeth rose, and, in crossing the stage, dropped her glove as she\r\npassed the poet. No notice was taken by him of the incident; and the\r\nQueen, desirous of finding out whether this was the result of\r\ninadvertence, or a determination to preserve the consistency of his\r\npart, moved again towards him, and again dropped her glove.\r\nShakespeare then stooped down to pick it up, saying, in the character\r\nof the monarch whom he was playing--\r\n\r\n \"And though now bent on this high embassy,\r\n  Yet stoop we to take up our cousin's glove.\"\r\n\r\nHe then retired and presented the glove to the Queen, who was highly\r\npleased with his courtly performance.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAND CHRISTMAS AT GRAY'S INN.\r\n\r\nIn 1594 there was a celebrated Christmas at Gray's Inn, of which an\r\naccount was published in 1688 under the following title:--\r\n\r\n\"Gesta Grayorum: or the History of the High and Mighty Prince, Henry\r\nPrince of Purpoole, Arch-Duke of Stapulia and Bernardia, Duke of High\r\nand Nether Holborn, Marquis of St. Giles and Tottenham, Count\r\nPalatine of Bloomsbury and Clerkenwell, Great Lord of the Cantons of\r\nIslington, Kentish-Town, Paddington, and Knights-bridge, Knight of the\r\nmost Heroical Order of the Helmet, and Sovereign of the same; Who\r\nReigned and Died, A.D. 1594. Together with a Masque, as it was\r\npresented (by his Highness's Command) for the entertainment of Q.\r\nElizabeth; who, with the Nobles of both Courts, was present thereat.\r\nLondon, Printed for W. Canning, at his shop in the Temple-Cloysters,\r\nMDCLXXXVIII. Price one shilling.\" 4to nine sheets, dedicated \"To the\r\nmost honourable Matthew Smyth, Esq., Comptroller of the honourable\r\nsociety of the Inner Temple.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Purpoole was Mr. Henry Helmes, a Norfolk gentleman, \"who\r\nwas thought to be accomplished with all good parts, fit for so great a\r\ndignity; and was also a very proper man of personage, and very active\r\nin dancing and revelling.\" His coffers were filled by voluntary\r\ncontributors, amongst whom the lord treasurer, Sir William Cecil, sent\r\nhim ten pounds, and a purse of rich needlework.\r\n\r\nThe performers were highly applauded by Queen Elizabeth, who expressed\r\nsatisfaction in her own peculiar style. When the actors had performed\r\ntheir Masque, some of her Majesty's courtiers danced a measure,\r\nwhereupon the Queen exclaimed: \"What! shall we have bread and cheese\r\nafter a banquet?\" Finally the Prince and his Officers of State were\r\nhonoured by kissing her fair hands, and receiving the most flattering\r\ncommendations. The whole amusement terminated in fighting at barriers;\r\nthe Earl of Essex, and others, challengers; the Earl of Cumberland and\r\ncompany defendants, \"into which number,\" says the narrator, \"our\r\nPrince was taken, and behaved himself so valiantly and skilfully\r\ntherein, that he had the prize adjudged due unto him, which it pleased\r\nher Majesty to deliver him with her own hands; telling him, that it\r\nwas not her gift, for if it had, it should have been better; but she\r\ngave it to him, as that prize which was due to his desert, and good\r\nbehaviour in those exercises; and that hereafter he should be\r\nremembered with a better reward from herself. The prize was a jewel,\r\nset with seventeen diamonds and four rubies; in value accounted worth\r\na hundred marks.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is the Gray's Inn list of performers, which included\r\nsome gentlemen who were afterwards \"distinguished members in the law.\"\r\n\r\n[From \"Gesta Grayorum,\" page 6.]\r\n\r\n\"The order of the Prince of Purpoole's proceedings, with his\r\nofficers and

The full title is: \"Christmas's\r\nLamentation for the losse of his acquaintance; showing how he is forst\r\nto leave the country and come to London.\" It appears to have been\r\npublished at the end of the sixteenth or the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century. The burden of the song is that Christmas \"charity\r\nfrom the country is fled,\" and the first verse will sufficiently\r\nindicate the style of the writing:--\r\n\r\n  Christmas is my name, far have I gone,\r\n  Have I gone, have I gone, have I gone, without regard,\r\n  Whereas great men by flocks there be flown,\r\n  There be flown, there be flown, there be flown, to London-ward;\r\n  Where they in pomp and pleasure do waste\r\n  That which Christmas was wonted to feast, Welladay!\r\n  Houses where music was wont for to ring\r\n  Nothing but bats and owlets do sing.\r\n      Welladay! Welladay! Welladay! where should I stay?\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD CHRISTMAS RETURNED\r\n\r\nis the title of a lively Christmas ditty which is a kind of reply to\r\nthe preceding ballad. It is preserved in the collection formed by\r\nSamuel Pepys, some time Secretary to the Admiralty, and author of the\r\nfamous diary, and by him bequeathed to Magdalene College, Cambridge.\r\nThe full title and first verse of the old song are as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Old Christmas returned, or Hospitality revived; being a Looking-glass\r\nfor Rich Misers, wherein they may see (if they be not blind) how much\r\nthey are to blame for their penurious house-keeping, and likewise an\r\nencouragement to those noble-minded gentry, who lay out a great part\r\nof their estates in hospitality, relieving such persons as have need\r\nthereof:\r\n\r\n 'Who feasts the poor, a true reward shall find,\r\n  Or helps the old, the feeble, lame, and blind.'\"\r\n\r\n \"All you that to feasting and mirth are inclined,\r\n  Come, here is good news for to pleasure your mind;\r\n  Old Christmas is come for to keep open house,\r\n  He scorns to be guilty of starving a mouse;\r\n  Then come, boys, and welcome, for diet the chief,\r\n  Plum-pudding, goose, capon, minc'd pies, and roast beef.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS-KEEPING IN THE COUNTRY\r\n\r\nwas revived in accordance with the commands of Queen Elizabeth, who\r\nlistened sympathetically to the \"Lamentations\" of her lowlier\r\nsubjects. Their complaint was that the royal and public pageants at\r\nChristmastide allured to the metropolis many country gentlemen, who,\r\nneglecting the comforts of their dependents in the country at this\r\nseason, dissipated in town part of their means for assisting them, and\r\nincapacitated themselves from continuing that hospitality for which\r\nthe country had been so long noted. In order to check this practice,\r\nthe gentlemen of Norfolk and Suffolk were commanded by Queen Elizabeth\r\nto depart from London before Christmas, and \"to repair to their\r\ncounties, and there to keep hospitality amongst their neighbours.\" The\r\npresence of the higher classes was needed among the country people to\r\ngive that assistance which was quaintly recommended by Tusser in his\r\n\"Hundreth good Points of Husbandrie\":\r\n\r\n \"At Christmas be mery, and thanke God of all:\r\n  And feast thy pore neighbours, the great with the small.\r\n  Yea al the yere long have an eie to the poore:\r\n  And God shall sende luck to kepe open thy doore.\"\r\n\r\nHenry Lord Berkeley, who had a seat in Warwickshire,\r\nappears to have set a good example in this respect to the\r\nnoblemen of the period, for, according to Dugdale, \"the greatest\r\npart of this lord's abydinge after his mother's death, happenynge\r\nin the sixth yeare of Queen Elizabeth, was at Callowdon, till his\r\nown death in the eleventh of Kinge James, from whence, once\r\nin two or three yeares, hee used in July to come to Berkeley.\"\r\nThe historic house of Berkeley essentially belongs to Gloucestershire;\r\nbut on the death of Edward VI., Henry Lord Berkeley,\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n \"With a good old fashion, when Christmas was come,\r\n  To call in all his old neighbours with bagpipe and drum.\"]\r\n\r\nby descent from the Mowbrays and the Segraves, became possessed of the\r\nancient Manor and castellated mansion of Caludon, near Coventry, where\r\nhe lived in splendour, and kept a grand retinue, being profuse in his\r\nhospitalities at Christmas, as well as in his alms to the poor\r\nthroughout the year. \"As touchinge the Almes to the poore of 5 & six\r\ncountry p'ishes & villages hard adjoyninge to Callowdon were relieved,\r\nwith each of them a neepe of holsome pottage, with a peece of beoffe\r\nor mutton therin, halfe a cheate loafe, & a kan of beere, besides the\r\nprivate Almes that dayly went out of his purse never without eight or\r\nten shillings in single money of ijd iijd & groates, & besides\r\nhis Maundy & Thursday before Ester day, wherein many poore men and\r\nwomen were clothed by the liberality of this lord and his first wife,\r\nwhilest they lived; and besides twenty markes, or twenty pound, or\r\nmore, which thrice each yeare, against the feaste of Christmas, Ester,\r\nand Whitsontide, was sent by this Lord to two or three of the chiefest\r\nInhabitants of these villages, and of Gosford Street at Coventry, to\r\nbee distributed amongst the poore accordinge to their discretions.\r\nSuch was the humanity of this Lord, that in tymes of Christmas and\r\nother festyvalls, when his neighbor townships were invited and feasted\r\nin his Hall, hee would, in the midst of their dynner, ryse from his\r\nowne, & goynge to each of their tables in his Hall, cheerfully bid\r\nthem welcome. And his further order was, having guests of Honour or\r\nremarkable ranke that filled his owne table, to seate himselfe at the\r\nlower end; and when such guests filled but half his bord, & a meaner\r\ndegree the rest of his table, then to seate himselfe the last of the\r\nfirst ranke, & the first of the later, which was about the midst of\r\nhis large tables, neare the salt.\"\r\n\r\nAnother home of Christmas hospitality in the days of \"Good Queen Bess\"\r\nwas Penshurst in Kent, the birthplace of the distinguished and\r\nchivalrous Sir Philip Sidney. \"All who enjoyed the hospitality of\r\nPenshurst,\" says Mills's _History of Chivalry_, \"were equal in\r\nconsideration of the host; there were no odious distinctions of rank\r\nor fortune; 'the dishes did not grow coarser as they receded from the\r\nhead of the table,' and no huge salt-cellar divided the noble from the\r\nignoble guests.\" That hospitality was the honourable distinction of\r\nthe Sidney family in general is also evident from Ben Jonson's lines\r\non Penshurst:\r\n\r\n              \"Whose liberal board doth flow\r\n  With all that hospitality doth know!\r\n  Where comes no guest but is allow'd to eat,\r\n  Without his fear, and of thy Lord's own meat\r\n  Where the same beer and bread, and self-same wine,\r\n  That is His Lordship's, shall be also mine.\"[57]\r\n\r\nA reviewer of \"The Sidneys of Penshurst,\" by Philip Sidney, says there\r\nis a tradition that the Black Prince and his Fair Maid of Kent once\r\nspent their Christmastide at Penshurst, whose banqueting hall, one of\r\nthe finest in England, dates back to that age of chivalry. At\r\nPenshurst Spenser wrote part of his \"Shepherd's Calendar,\" and Ben\r\nJonson drank and rhymed and revelled in this stateliest of English\r\nmanor houses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHRISTMAS IN THE HALL.\r\n\r\n  \"A man might then behold,\r\n    At Christmas, in each hall,\r\n  Good fires to curb the cold,\r\n    And meat for great and small.\"]\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth died on March 23, 1603, after nominating James VI. of\r\nScotland as her successor, and\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACCESSION OF KING JAMES,\r\n\r\nas James I. of England, united the crowns of England and Scotland,\r\nwhich had been the aim of Mary Queen of Scots before her death.\r\n\r\n    [49] Cassell's \"History of England.\"\r\n\r\n    [50] \"Domestic Memoirs of the Royal Family.\"\r\n\r\n    [51] \"History of the English People.\"\r\n\r\n    [52] \"Progresses.\"\r\n\r\n    [53] \"English Plays.\"\r\n\r\n    [54] Sir William Dugdale's \"Origines Juridiciales.\"\r\n\r\n    [55] \"Progresses.\"\r\n\r\n    [56] \"History of Music,\" vol iii. p. 15.\r\n\r\n    [57] Gifford's \"Ben Jonson,\" vol. viii. p. 254.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER VIII._\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS UNDER JAMES I.\r\n\r\n(1603-1625.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURT MASQUES.\r\n\r\nThe Court entertainments of Christmastide in the reign of James the\r\nFirst consisted chiefly of the magnificent masques of Ben Jonson and\r\nothers, who, by their training in the preceding reign, had acquired a\r\nmastery of the dramatic art. The company to which Shakespeare belonged\r\n(that of Lord Chamberlain's players) became the King's players on the\r\naccession of James, and several of Shakespeare's plays were produced\r\nat Court. But very early in this reign plays gave place to the more\r\ncostly and elaborate entertainments called masques, but which were\r\nvery different from the dumb-show masques of Elizabeth's reign, the\r\nmasquerades of Henry the Eighth, and the low-buffoonery masques of\r\nearlier times. At the Court of James thousands of pounds were\r\nsometimes expended on the production of a single masque. To the aid of\r\npoetry, composed by poets of the first rank, came the most skilful\r\nmusicians and the most ingenious machinists. Inigo Jones, who became\r\narchitect to the Court in 1606, shared honours with Ben Jonson in the\r\nproduction of the Court masques, as did also Henry Lawes, the eminent\r\nmusician. In some of the masques the devices of attire were the work\r\nof \"Master Jones,\" as well as the invention and the architecture of\r\nthe whole of the scenery. D'Israeli[58] says:--\"That the moveable\r\nscenery of these masques formed as perfect a scenical illusion as any\r\nthat our own age, with all its perfection and decoration, has attained\r\nto, will not be denied by those who have read the few masques that\r\nhave been printed. They usually contrived a double division of the\r\nscene; one part was for some time concealed from the spectator, which\r\nproduced surprise and variety. Thus in the Lord's Masque, at the\r\nmarriage of the Palatine, the scene was divided into two parts from\r\nthe roof to the floor; the lower part being first discovered, there\r\nappeared a wood in perspective, the innermost part being of \"releeve\r\nor whole round,\" the rest painted. On the left a cave, and on the\r\nright a thicket from which issued Orpheus. At the back of the scene,\r\nat the sudden fall of a curtain, the upper part broke on the\r\nspectators, a heaven of clouds of all hues; the stars suddenly\r\nvanished, the clouds dispersed; an element of artificial fire played\r\nabout the house of Prometheus--a bright and transparent cloud reaching\r\nfrom the heavens to the earth, whence the eight maskers descended with\r\nthe music of a full song; and at the end of their descent the cloud\r\nbroke in twain, and one part of it, as with a wind, was blown athwart\r\nthe scene. While this cloud was vanishing, the wood, being the under\r\npart of the scene, was insensibly changing: a perspective view opened,\r\nwith porticoes on each side, and female statues of silver, accompanied\r\nwith ornaments of architecture, filled the end of the house of\r\nPrometheus, and seemed all of goldsmith's work. The women of\r\nPrometheus descended from their niches till the anger of Jupiter\r\nturned them again into statues. It is evident, too, that the size of\r\nthe procenium accorded with the magnificence of the scene; for I find\r\nchoruses described, 'and changeable conveyances of the song,' in\r\nmanner of an echo, performed by more than forty different voices and\r\ninstruments in various parts of the scene.\"\r\n\r\nThe masque, as Lord Bacon says, was composed for princes, and by\r\nprinces it was played. The King and Queen, Prince Henry, and Prince\r\nCharles (afterwards Charles the First) all appeared in Court masques,\r\nas did also the nobility and gentry of the Court, foreign ambassadors,\r\nand other eminent personages.\r\n\r\nIn his notes to \"The Masque of Queens,\" Ben Jonson refers several\r\ntimes to \"the King's Majesty's book (our sovereign) of Demonology.\"\r\nThe goat ridden was said to be often the devil himself, but \"of the\r\ngreen cock, we have no other ground (to confess ingenuously) than a\r\nvulgar fable of a witch, that with a cock of that colour, and a bottom\r\nof blue thread, would transport herself through the air; and so\r\nescaped (at the time of her being brought to execution) from the hand\r\nof justice. It was a tale when I went to school.\"\r\n\r\nThat there was no lack of ability for carrying out the Court commands\r\nin regard to the Christmas entertainments of this period is evident\r\nfrom the company of eminent men who used to meet at the \"Mermaid.\"\r\n\"Sir Walter Raleigh,\" says Gifford,[59] \"previously to his unfortunate\r\nengagement with the wretched Cobham and others, had instituted a\r\nmeeting of _beaux esprits_ at the Mermaid, a celebrated tavern in\r\nFriday Street. Of this club, which combined more talent and genius,\r\nperhaps, than ever met together before or since, Jonson was a member;\r\nand here, for many years, he regularly repaired with Shakespeare,\r\nBeaumont, Fletcher, Selden, Cotton, Carew, Martin, Donne, and many\r\nothers, whose names, even at this distant period, call up a mingled\r\nfeeling of reverence and respect.\" Here, in the full flow and\r\nconfidence of friendship, the lively and interesting \"wit-combats\"\r\ntook place between Shakespeare and Jonson; and hither, in probable\r\nallusion to them, Beaumont fondly lets his thoughts wander in his\r\nletter to Jonson from the country.\r\n\r\n                   \"What things have we seen,\r\n  Done at the Mermaid? heard words that have been,\r\n  So nimble, and so full of subtle flame,\r\n  As if that every one from whom they came,\r\n  Had meant to put his whole wit in a jest,\" &c.\r\n\r\nMasques, however, were not the only Christmas diversions of royalty at\r\nthis period, for James I. was very fond of hunting, and Nichols[60]\r\nsays that, in 1604, the King kept\r\n\r\n\r\nA ROYAL CHRISTMAS AT ROYSTON,\r\n\r\nat his new hunting seat there, and \"between the 18th of December and\r\n22nd of January he there knighted Sir Richard Hussey, of Salop; Sir\r\nEdward Bushell, of Gloucestershire; Sir John Fenwick, of\r\nNorthumberland; Sir John Huet, of London; Sir Robert Jermyn, of\r\nSuffolk; Sir Isaac Jermyn, of Suffolk; Sir John Rowse; Sir Thomas\r\nMuschamp, of Surrey. Mr. Chamberlaine, in a letter to Mr. Winwood from\r\nLondon, December 18th, says: 'The King came back from Royston on\r\nSaturday; but so far from being weary or satisfyed with those sports,\r\nthat presently after the holy-days he makes reckoning to be there\r\nagaine, or, as some say, to go further towards Lincolnshire, to a\r\nplace called _Ancaster Heath_.'\"\r\n\r\nIn this letter Mr. Chamberlaine also refers to\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER COURT AMUSEMENTS OF CHRISTMASTIDE,\r\n\r\nfor, proceeding, he says:--\r\n\r\n\"In the meantime here is great provision for Cockpit, to entertaine\r\nhim at home, and of Masks and Revells against the marriage of Sir\r\nPhilip Herbert and the Lady Susan Vere, which is to be celebrated on\r\nSt. John's Day. The Queen hath likewise a great Mask in hand against\r\nTwelfth-tide, for which there was L3,000 delivered a month ago. Her\r\nbrother, the Duke of Holst, is here still, procuring a levy of men to\r\ncarry into Hungary. The Tragedy of 'Gowry,' with all the action and\r\nactors, hath been twice represented by the King's Players, with\r\nexceeding concourse of all sorts of people; but whether the matter or\r\nmanner be not well handled, or that it be thought unfit that Princes\r\nshould be played on the stage in their lifetime, I hear that some\r\ngreat Councellors are much displeased with it, and so 'tis thought\r\nshall be forbidden. And so wishing a merry Christmas and many a good\r\nyear to you and Mrs. Winwood, I committ you to God. Yours, most\r\nassuredly, John Chamberlaine.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the 26th of January, Mr. Chamberlaine writes thus to Mr. Winwood:\r\n'I doubt not but Dudley Carleton hath acquainted you with all their\r\nChristmas-games at Court, for he was a spectator of all the sports and\r\nshows. The King went to Royston two days after Twelfth-tide, where and\r\nthereabout he hath continued ever since, and finds such felicity in\r\nthat hunting life, that he hath written to the Councill that it is the\r\nonly means to maintain his health, which being the health and welfare\r\nof us all, he desires them to take the charge and burden of affairs,\r\nand foresee that he be not interrupted or _troubled with too much\r\nbusiness_.'\"\r\n\r\nCampion's Masque in honour of Lord Hayes and his bride was presented\r\nbefore King James, at Whitehall, on Twelfth Night, 1606; and in\r\nreference to the Christmas festivities at Court the following year\r\n(1607), Mr. Chamberlaine, writing to Sir D. Carleton, on the 5th of\r\nJanuary, says:\r\n\r\n\"The Masque goes forward at Court for Twelfth-day, though I doubt the\r\nNew Room will be scant ready. All the Holidays there were Plays; but\r\nwith so little concourse of strangers, that they say they wanted\r\ncompany. The King was very earnest to have one on Christmas-night; but\r\nthe Lords told him it was not the fashion. Which answer pleased him\r\nnot a whit; but he said, 'What do you tell me of the fashion? I will\r\nmake it a fashion.' Yesterday he dined in the Presence in great pomp,\r\nwith two rich cupboards of plate, the one gold, the other that of the\r\nHouse of Burgundy pawned to Queen Elizabeth by the States of Brabant,\r\nand hath seldom been seen abroad, being exceeding massy, fair, and\r\nsumptuous. I could learn no reason of this extraordinary bravery, but\r\nthat he would show himself in glory to certain Scots that were never\r\nhere before, as they say there be many lately come, and that the Court\r\nis full of new and strange faces. Yesterday there were to be shewn\r\ncertain rare fire-works contrived by a Dane, two Dutchmen, and Sir\r\nThomas Challoner, in concert.\"\r\n\r\nOn January 8th, another letter of Mr. Chamberlaine thus refers to\r\ngaming at Court: \"On the Twelfth-eve there was great golden play at\r\nCourt. No Gamester admitted that brought not L300 at least. Montgomery\r\nplayed the King's money, and won him L750, which he had for his\r\nlabour. The Lord Montegle lost the Queen L400. Sir Robert Cary, for\r\nthe Prince, L300; and the Earl Salisbury, L300; the Lord Buckhurst,\r\nL500; _et sic de caeteris_. So that I heard of no winner but the King\r\nand Sir Francis Wolley, who got above L800. The King went a\r\nhawking-journey yesterday to Theobalds and returns to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\"Above Westminster the Thames is quite frozen over; and the Archbishop\r\ncame from Lambeth, on Twelfth-day, over the ice to Court. Many\r\nfanciful experiments are daily put in practice; as certain youths\r\nburnt a gallon of wine upon the ice, and made all the passengers\r\npartakers. But the best is, of an honest woman (they say) that had a\r\ngreat longing to encrease her family on the Thames\" (Nichols's\r\n\"Progresses\").\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF JAMES I.'S FAVOURITES\r\n\r\ndates from Christmas Day, 1607, when he knighted Robert Carr, or Ker,\r\na young border Scot of the Kers of Fernihurst, the first of the\r\nfavourites who ruled both the King and the kingdom. Carr had been some\r\nyears in France, and being a handsome youth--\"straight-limbed,\r\nwell-formed, strong-shouldered, and smooth-faced\"--he had been led to\r\nbelieve that if he cultivated his personal appearance and a\r\ncourtliness of address, he was sure of making his fortune at the Court\r\nof James. \"Accordingly he managed to appear as page to Lord Dingwall\r\nat a grand tilting match at Westminster, in 1606. According to\r\nchivalric usage it became his duty to present his lord's shield to his\r\nMajesty; but in manoeuvring his horse on the occasion it fell and\r\nbroke his leg. That fall was his rise. James was immediately struck\r\nwith the beauty of the youth who lay disabled at his feet, and had him\r\nstraightway carried into a house near Charing Cross, and sent his own\r\nsurgeon to him.... On Christmas Day, 1607, James knighted him and made\r\nhim a gentleman of the bedchamber, so as to have him constantly about\r\nhis person. Such was his favour that every one pressed around him to\r\nobtain their suits with the King. He received rich presents; the\r\nladies courted his attention; the greatest lords did him the most\r\nobsequious and disgusting homage.\"[61] He afterwards formed that\r\nconnection with Frances Howard, Countess of Essex, which resulted in\r\nher divorce from her husband, and, subsequently, on his marrying Lady\r\nEssex, the King made him Earl of Somerset, that the lady might not\r\nlose in rank. On the circumstances attending the murder of Sir Thomas\r\nOverbury being brought to light, the complicity of Somerset was\r\nthought to be involved in the ascertained guilt of his wife. In May,\r\n1616, the Countess was convicted; a week later her husband shared her\r\nfate. After a long imprisonment Somerset was pardoned, and ended his\r\nlife in obscurity.\r\n\r\nIn this reign the Court revels and shows of Christmas were imitated at\r\nthe country seats of the nobility and gentry, and at the Colleges of\r\nOxford and Cambridge. An account has been preserved of one of the most\r\nremarkable exhibitions of this kind, entitled--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE CHRISTMAS PRINCE.\"\r\n\r\nIt took place in the year 1607, at St. John's College, Oxford, and the\r\nauthentic account was published from the original manuscript, in 1816,\r\nby Robert Tripbook, of 23, Old Bond Street, London: \"To the\r\nPresident, Fellows, and Scholars of St. John Baptist College, in the\r\nUniversity of Oxford, this curious Record of an ancient custom in\r\ntheir Society, is respectfully inscribed by the Publisher.\" Of the\r\nauthenticity of this description the Publisher says \"no doubt can\r\npossibly exist, it was written by an eye-witness of, and performer in,\r\nthe sports; and is now printed, for the first time, from the original\r\nmanuscript preserved in the College Library.\r\n\r\n\"From the Boy Bishop, the Christmas Prince may be supposed to derive\r\nhis origin. Whilst the former was bearing sway in the ecclesiastical\r\nfoundations, the latter was elected to celebrate the festivities of\r\nChristmas in the King's palace, at the seats of the nobility, at the\r\nuniversities, and in the Inns of Court. The custom prevailed till the\r\nascendancy of the Puritans during the civil war; and some idea of the\r\nexpense, and general support it received, may be formed from the\r\naccount of the Gray's Inn Prince and an extract from one of the\r\nStrafford Papers. The latter is from a letter written by the Rev. G.\r\nGarrard to the Earl of Strafford, dated Jan. 8, 1635: 'The Middle\r\nTemple House have set up a prince, who carries himself in great state;\r\none Mr. Vivian a Cornish gentleman, whose father Sir Francis Vivian\r\nwas fined in the Star-Chamber about a castle he held in Cornwall,\r\nabout three years since. He hath all his great officers attending him,\r\nlord keeper, lord treasurer, eight white staves at the least, captain\r\nof his pensioners, captain of his guard, two chaplains, who on Sunday\r\nlast preached before him, and in the pulpit made three low legs to his\r\nexcellency before they began, which is much laughed at. My lord\r\nchamberlain lent him two fair cloths of state, one hung up in the hall\r\nunder which he dines, the other in his privy chamber; he is served on\r\nthe knee, and all that come to see him kiss his hand on their knee. My\r\nlord of Salisbury hath sent him pole-axes for his pensioners. He sent\r\nto my lord of Holland, his justice in Eyre, for venison, which he\r\nwillingly sends him; to the lord mayor and sheriffs of London for\r\nwine, all obey. Twelfth-day was a great day, going to the chapel many\r\npetitions were delivered him, which he gave to his masters of the\r\nrequests. He hath a favourite, whom with some others, gentlemen of\r\ngreat quality, he knighted at his return from church, and dined in\r\ngreat state; at the going out of the chambers into the garden, when he\r\ndrank the King's health, the glass being at his mouth he let it fall,\r\nwhich much defaced his purple satten suit, for so he was clothed that\r\nday, having a cloak of the same down to his foot, for he mourns for\r\nhis father who lately died. It cost this prince L2,000 out of his own\r\npurse. I hear of no other design, but that all this is done to make\r\nthem fit to give the prince elector a royal entertainment with masks,\r\ndancings, and some other exercises of wit, in orations or\r\narraignments, that day that they invite him.'\r\n\r\n\"The writer, or narrator, of the events connected with the Christmas\r\nPrince of St. John's was Griffin Higgs, who was descended of a\r\nrespectable and opulent family in Gloucestershire, though he was\r\nhimself born at Stoke Abbat, near Henley on Thames, in 1589. He was\r\neducated at St. John's, and thence, in 1611, elected fellow of Merton\r\ncollege, where he distinguished himself, in the execution of the\r\nprocuratorial duties, as a man of great courage, though, says Wood, of\r\nlittle stature. In 1627 he was appointed chaplain to the Queen of\r\nBohemia, by her brother Charles the First, and during his absence, in\r\nthe performance of his duties, was created a doctor of divinity at\r\nLeyden by the learned Andrew Rivet. He returned, after a residence\r\nabroad of about twelve years, when he had the valuable rectory of\r\nClive or Cliff, near Dover, and shortly after the deanery of\r\nLichfield, conferred upon him. During the civil wars he was a sufferer\r\nfor the royal cause, and, losing his preferment, retired to the place\r\nof his birth, where he died in the year 1659, and was buried in the\r\nchancel of the church of South Stoke.\r\n\r\n\"Thomas Tucker, the elected Prince, was born in London, in 1586,\r\nentered at St. John's in 1601, became fellow of that house and took\r\nholy orders. He afterwards had the vicarage of Pipping-burge, or\r\nPemberge, in Kent, and the rectory of Portshead, near Bristol, and\r\nfinally obtained the third stall in the cathedral church of Bristol,\r\nin which he was succeeded, August 25, 1660, by Richard Standfast.\"\r\n\r\nThe following explanation is given of \"the apparently strange titles\r\nof the Prince of St. John's: 'The most magnificent and renowned\r\nThomas, by the favour of Fortune, Prince of _Alba Fortunata_, Lord St.\r\nJohns, high Regent of the Hall, Duke of St. Giles, Marquis of\r\nMagdalens, Landgrave of the Grove, County Palatine of the Cloisters,\r\nChief Bailiff of the Beaumonts, High Ruler of Rome, Master of the\r\nManor of Waltham, Governor of Gloucester Green, Sole Commander of all\r\nTilts,' &c. The Prince of _Alba Fortunata_ alludes, as may be readily\r\nconjectured, to the name of the founder, Sir Thomas _White_; St.\r\nJohn's, and the Hall, are equally clear; Magdalens is the parish in\r\nwhich a portion of the college stands, and a part of which belongs to\r\nthe society; the Grove and the Cloisters are again parts of the home\r\ndomain of the college; Beaumonts is the name of a portion of land\r\nbelonging to the college, on which stands the ruin of the palace of\r\nBeaumonts, built about the year 1128 by King Henry the First; Rome is\r\na piece of land so called, near to the end of the walk called _Non\r\nUltra_, on the north side of Oxford. The manor of Waltham, or Walton,\r\nis situate in the north suburb of Oxford, and is the property of the\r\ncollege, as is a considerable portion of Gloucester-green, which\r\nthough now better known as the site of an extensive bridewell, was in\r\n1607 literally a meadow, and without any building more contiguous than\r\nGloucester-hall, from which house it derived its name.\"\r\n\r\nThen follows \"A true and faithfull relation of the rising and fall of\r\nThomas Tucker, Prince of _Alba Fortunata_, Lord St. Johns, &c., with\r\nall the occurrents which happened throughout his whole domination.\"\r\n\r\n\"It happened in the yeare of our Lord 1607, the 31 of October, beinge\r\nAll Sayntes Eve, that at night a fier was made in the Hall of St. John\r\nBaptist's Colledge, in Oxon, accordinge to the custome and statuts of\r\nthe same place, at which time the whole companye or most parte of the\r\nStudents of the same house mette together to beginne their Christmas,\r\nof which some came to see sports, to witte the Seniors as well\r\nGraduates, as Under-graduates. Others to make sports, viz., Studentes\r\nof the seconde yeare, whom they call Poulderlings, others to make\r\nsporte with all, of this last sorte were they whome they call\r\nFresh-menn, Punies of the first yeare, who are by no meanes admitted\r\nto be agents or behoulders of those sports, before themselves have\r\nbeen patient perfourmers of them. But (as it often falleth out) the\r\nFreshmen or patients, thinkinge the Poulderlings or Agentes too buysie\r\nand nimble, They them too dull and backwarde in theyr duety, the\r\nstanders by findinge both of them too forwarde and violente, the\r\nsportes for that night for feare of tumultes weare broken upp, everye\r\nmann betakinge himself to his reste.\r\n\r\n\"The next night followinge, beinge the feast of All Sayntes, at nighte\r\nthey mett agayne together; And whereas it was hoped a night's sleepe\r\nwould have somewhat abated their rage, it contraryewise sett a greater\r\nedge on theyr furye, they havinge all this while but consulted how to\r\ngett more strength one agaynst another, and consequently to breed newe\r\nquarrells and contradictions, in so much that the strife and\r\ncontentions of youthes and children had like to have sett Men together\r\nby the eares, to the utter annihilatinge of all Christmas sportes for\r\nthe whole yeare followinge.\r\n\r\n\"Wherfore for the avoydinge both the one, and the other, some who\r\nstudied the quiet of all, mentioned the choosinge of a Christmas Lord,\r\nor Prince of the Revells, who should have authorytie both to appoynt &\r\nmoderate all such games, and pastimes as should ensue, & to punishe\r\nall offenders which should any way hinder or interrupte the free &\r\nquiet passage of any antient & allowed sporte.\r\n\r\n\"This motion (for that the person of a Prince or Lorde of the Revells\r\nhad not been knowen amongst them for thirty yeares before, and so\r\nconsequentlye the danger, charge and trouble of such jestinge was\r\ncleane forgotten) was presentlye allowed and greedilye apprehended of\r\nall; Wher upon 13 of the senior Under graduates (7 of the bodye of the\r\nHouse & 6 Comoners, Electors in such a case) withdrew themselves into\r\nthe parlour, where after longe debatinge whether they should chouse a\r\nGraduate or an Under Graduate, thinkinge the former would not\r\nvouchsafe to undertake it at theyr appoyntmentes, the latter should\r\nnot be upheld & backed as it was meete & necessary for such a place,\r\nthey came forth rather to make triall what would be done, than to\r\nresolve what should be done. And therefore at their first entrance\r\ninto the Hall meeting Sir Towse a younge man (as they thought) fitt\r\nfor the choyse, they laid handes on him, and by maine strength\r\nliftinge him upp, _viva voce_, pronounced him Lord. But hee as\r\nstronglye refusinge the place as they violentlye thrust it upon him,\r\nshewing with all reasons why hee could by no meanes undergoe such a\r\ncharge, they gott onlye this good by their first attempt, that they\r\nunderstood heer by how that the whole Colledge was rather willinge a\r\nSeniour Batchelour at least, if not a junior Master should be chosen\r\nin to the place rather than any Under graduate, because they would\r\nrather an earnest sporte than a scoffinge jest should be made of it.\r\nWher fore the Electors returninge againe into the Parlour and\r\nshuttinge the dore close upon themselves begaune more seriously to\r\nconsult of the matter, and findinge some unable, some unwillinge to\r\ntake the place, at length they concluded to make the 2 weird printing\r\nerror?] assay but with more formalitie and deliberation; resolvinge,\r\nif they were not now seconded of all handes, to meddle no more with\r\nit. Wherfore, enteringe the second time in to the Hall they desired\r\none of the 10 Seniors & one of the Deanes of the Colledge to hold the\r\nScrutinye and the Vice-President to sitt by as overseer, who willingly\r\nharkeninge to their request, sate all 3 downe at the highe table: Then\r\nthe Electors went up one by one in senioritye to give their voyce by\r\nwritinge. In the meane time there was great expectation who should bee\r\nthe Man. Some in the lower ende of the Hall, to make sporte, had theyr\r\nNames loudest in their mouthes whome they least thought of in their\r\nmindes, & whome they knew should come shortest of the place. At length\r\nall the voyces being given and, accordinge to custome, the Scrutinie\r\nat large being burned, the Vice-president with the rest stoode upp,\r\nand out of the abstract the Deane read distinctly in the hearinge of\r\nall present as followeth\r\n\r\n \"_Nominantur in hoc Scrutinio duo quorum_\r\n    { 1 Joanes Towse, _habet suffragia sex_.\r\n    { 2us Thomas Tucker, _habet suffragia septem_.\r\n\r\n\"These wordes were not out of his mouthe before a generall and loud\r\ncrie was made of Tucker, Tucker, Vivat, Vivat, &ct. After which all\r\nthe younger sorte rane forth of the Colledge crieinge the same in the\r\nstreets; which Sir Tucker beinge then howsde not farr from the\r\nColledge, over hearinge, kept himself close till the companye were\r\npast, and then, as soone and secretly as he could, gott him to his\r\nChamber; where (after he had been longe sought for abroad in the\r\nTowne, and at home in the Colledge, haste and desire out runinge it\r\nself, and seekinge there last where it might first finde) he was in a\r\nmanner surprised, and more by violence than any will of his owne,\r\ntaken upp & with continuall & joyfull outcries, carried about the\r\nHall, and so backe to his Chamber, as his owne request was, where for\r\nthat night he rested, dismissinge the Company and desiringe some time\r\nto think of their loves and goodwill, and to consider of his owne\r\ncharge and place.\r\n\r\n\"About 3 or 4 dayes after, on the 5 of November the Lord Elect with\r\nthe Batchelours, and some of the Senior Under-graduates came into the\r\nHall where every man beinge seated in his order, many speaches were\r\nmade by diverse of diverse matters, some commendinge a monarchicall\r\nstate of Governmente, and the sometimes suddayne necessitye of\r\nDictators, others discommendinge both. Some again extollinge sportes &\r\nrevells, others mainely disallowinge them, all of them drawinge some\r\nconclusion concerninge the like or dislike of the government newly\r\nbegune, and like for a little space to continue amongst them. In the\r\nende the Lord Elect himselfe, to conclude all, delivered his owne\r\nminde in manner followinge:--\r\n\r\n\"Quae beneficia (Viri Electores clarissimi) plus difficultatis atque,\r\noneris apportant collacata, qu[=a] debite administrata; poterunt honoris,\r\ncaute magis primo in limine credo excipienda qu[=a] aut imensae dignitatis\r\nexpectatione appetenda auide, aut boni incogniti coeco appetitu\r\napp'hendenda temere.

And not\r\nlong after the whole company of the Batchelours sent 2 bills to the\r\nMasters fire, the one cravinge duety and alleageance, the other money\r\nand maintenance in manner & forme followinge:\r\n\r\n  \"The coppye of a Bill sent by the Lord Elect, and the whole\r\n     Company of the Batchelours to the Masters fire, cravinge their\r\n     duety and alleageance.\r\n\r\n\"Not doubtinge of those ceremonious and outward duetyes which\r\nyourselves (for example sake) will performe, Wee _Thomas Tucker_ with\r\nthe rest of the Bacchelours are bold to entreat, but as _Thomas, Lord\r\nElect_, with the rest of our Councell are ready to expect, that no\r\nTutor or Officer whatsoever shall at any time, or upon any occasion,\r\nintermeddle, or partake with any scholler, or youth whatsoever, but\r\nleavinge all matters to the discretion of our selves, stand to those\r\ncensures and judgementes which wee shall give of all offenders that\r\nare under our govermente in causes appertaininge to our government.\r\nAll wayes promisinge a carefull readinesse to see schollerlike\r\nexcercise performed, and orderly quietnesse mayntained in all sortes;\r\nThis as Wee promise for our owne partes, so Wee would willingly desire\r\nthat you should promise the performance of the rest of your partes,\r\naccordinge to that bountye & love which allready you have shewed us.\r\n\r\n      Yours,    Thomas Tucker\r\n  Joseph Fletcher     Thomas Downer\r\n  John Smith          Rouland Juxon\r\n  Richard Baylye      John Huckstepp\r\n  Richard Holbrooke   James Bearblocke\r\n  John Towse          John English\r\n\r\n\"This Bill subscribed with all their handes was seene and allowed by\r\nall the Masters, who promised rather more than lesse than that which\r\nwas demanded. But concerninge the other Bill for Subsidyes, it was\r\nanswered that it was not in their power to grant it without the\r\nPresident, whose cominge home was every day expected: against which\r\ntime it was provided, and delivered unto him; who together with the 10\r\nSeniors, was loath to grant any thinge till they were certified what\r\nsportes should bee, of what quality & charge, that so they might the\r\nbetter proportion the one to the other, the meanes to the matter: They\r\nwere allso willinge to knowe what particular Men would take upon them\r\nthe care of furnishinge particular nightes. For they would by no\r\nmeanes relye upon generall promises because they were not ignorant how\r\nthat which concerneth all in generall is by no man in speciall\r\nregarded. Wherfore they beinge somewhat, although not fully, satisfied\r\nin their demaundes by some of the Masters, whom they seemed cheefly to\r\ntrust with the whole businesse, the Bill was againe perused, and every\r\nman ceazed in manner and forme followinge:\r\n\r\n \"'The coppye of an auncient Act for taxes and subsidyes made in the\r\n     raygne of our Predecessor of famous memorye, in this Parliament\r\n     held in Aula Regni the vi^{th} of November 1577 and now for Our\r\n     Self new ratified and published, anno regni j November 7 1607.\r\n\r\n\"'Because all lovinge & loyall Subjects doe owe not onely themselves,\r\nbut allso their landes, livinges, goodes, and what soever they call\r\ntheirs, to the good of the Commonwealth, and estate under which they\r\npeaceably enjoy all, It is further enacted that no man dissemble his\r\nestate, or hide his abilitye, but be willinge at all times to pay such\r\nduetyes, taxes, and subsidies, as shall be lawfully demaunded &\r\nthought reasonable without the hinderance of his owne estate, upon\r\npayne of forfettinge himself and his goodes whatsoever.'\r\n\r\n  [List of contributions amounting to 52^{li} xiii^{s.} vii]\r\n\r\n\"Though the whole company had thus largely contributed towards the\r\nensuinge sportes, yet it was found that when all thinges necessary\r\nshould be layed toegether, a great sum of money would be wantinge, and\r\ntherfore a course was thought upon of sendinge out privie Seales to\r\nable & willinge Gentlemen which had been sometimes Fellowes or\r\ncommoners of the Colledge that it would please them to better the\r\nstocke, and out of their good will contribute somewhat towardes the\r\nPrince's Revells.\"\r\n\r\nThen followed the form of the writ issued, \"To our trustye and\r\nwelbeloved Knight, or Esquire,\" &c. \"Given under our privye Seale at\r\nour Pallace of St. John's in Oxen, the seventh of December in the\r\nfirst yeare of our rayne, 1607.\" Then follow \"the names of those who\r\nwere served with this writt, and who most willingly obeyed upon the\r\nreceipt thereof,\" contributing altogether xvi^{li} x^{s} 0.\r\n\"Others were served and bragd of it, as though they had given, but\r\nsent nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"For all these Subsidies at home, and helpes abroad, yet it was founde\r\nthat in the ende there would rather be want (as indeed it happened)\r\nthan any superfluitye, and therfore the Prince tooke order with the\r\nBowsers to send out warrantes to all the Tenantes & other friendes of\r\nthe Colledge, that they should send in extraordinary provision against\r\nevery Feast, which accordingly was performed; some sendinge money,\r\nsome wine, some venison, some other provision, every one accordinge to\r\nhis abilitye.\r\n\r\n\"All thinges beinge thus sufficiently (as it was thought) provided\r\nfor, the Councell table, with the Lord himself, mett together to\r\nnominate officers & to appoint the day of the Prince's publike\r\ninstallment which was agreed should be on St. Andrews Day at night;\r\nbecause at that time the Colledge allso was to chouse their new\r\nofficers for the yeare followinge.\r\n\r\n\"Now for that they would not playnely and barely install him without\r\nany farther ceremonies, it was thought fitt that his whole ensuinge\r\nRegiment (for good lucke sake) should be consecrated to the _Deitie of\r\nFortune_, as the sole Mistres and Patronesse of his estate, and\r\ntherfore a schollerlike devise called _Ara Fortunae_ was provided for\r\nhis installment; which was performed in manner & forme followinge:\r\n\r\n\r\nARA FORTUNAE.\r\n\r\n_Inter-locutores._\r\n\r\nPrinceps.\r\nFortuna.\r\nTolmaea.\r\nThesaurarius.\r\nCamerarius.\r\nJurisconsultus.\r\nPhilosophus.\r\nRusticus.\r\nStultus.\r\nRebellis Primus.\r\n---- Secundus.\r\n---- Tertius.\r\n---- Quartus.\r\nNuncius.\r\n\r\n*     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n[The Drama is not given on account of its length.

But for all this it\r\nbegan before 8 of clock, and was well liked by the whole audience,\r\nwho, how unrulye so ever they meante to bee afterwardes, resolved I\r\nthink at first with their good applause and quiet behaviour to drawe\r\nus on so farr, as wee should not bee able to returne backwardes\r\nwithout shame & discreditt. They gave us at the ende 4 severall &\r\ngenerall plaudites; at the 2 wherof the Canopie which hunge over the\r\nAltare of Fortune (as it had been frighted with the noise, or meante\r\nto signifie that 2 plaudites were as much as it deserved) suddenly\r\nfell downe; but it was cleanly supported by some of the standers by\r\ntill the company was voyded, that none but our selves took notice of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Some upon the sight of this Showe (for the better enoblinge of his\r\nperson, and drawinge his pedigree even from the Godes because the\r\nPrince's name was Tucker, and the last Prince before him was Dr. Case)\r\nmade this conceipt that _Casus et Fortuna genuerunt [Greek: Tycheron]\r\nPrincipem Fortunatum_--so the one his father, and the other his\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n\"Another accident worthy observation (and which was allso then\r\nobserved) was that the Foole carelesly sittinge downe at the Prince's\r\nfeete brake his staff in the midst, whence wee could not but directly\r\ngather a verye ill omen, that the default and follye of some would bee\r\nthe very breaknecke of our ensueing sports, which how it fell out, I\r\nleave to the censures of others; our selves (I am sure) were guilty to\r\nour selves of many weaknesses and faultes, the number wherof were\r\nincreased by the crossinge untowardnesse, and backwardnesse of divers\r\nof the Prince's neerest followers, nay the Prince himself had some\r\nweaknesses which did much prejudice his state, wherof the chiefest\r\nweere his openesse, and familiaritye with all sortes, beinge\r\nunwillinge to displease eny, yet not able to please all. But to\r\nproceede:--On St. Thomas day at night the officers before elect were\r\nsolemnly proclaimed by a Sergeant at armes, and an Herauld, the\r\ntrumpetts soundinge beetwixt every title.

After\r\nsupper there was a private Showe performed in the manner of an\r\nInterlude, contayninge the order of the Saturnalls, and shewinge the\r\nfirst cause of Christmas-candles, and in the ende there was an\r\napplication made to the Day and Nativitie of Christ, all which was\r\nperformed in manner followinge:\r\n\r\nSATURNALIA.\r\n\r\nHercules\r\nCurius\r\nDoulus\r\n\r\n*     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\"This shew was very well liked of our selves, and the better: first,\r\nbecause itt was the voluntary service of a younge youth; nexte,\r\nbecause there were no strangers to trouble us.\r\n\r\n\"St. Steevens day was past over in silence, and so had St. John's day\r\nalso; butt that some of the Prince's honest neighbours of St. Giles's\r\npresented him with a maske, or morris, which though it were but\r\nrudely performed, yet itt being so freely and lovingly profered, it\r\ncould not but bee as lovingly received.\r\n\r\n\"The same nighte, the twelve daies were suddenly, and as it were\r\nextempore, brought in, to offer their service to the Prince, the\r\nholy-daies speaking Latine, and the working-daies English, the\r\ntransition was this:\r\n\r\n  Yee see these working-daies they weare no satten,\r\n  And I assure you they can speake no Latten;\r\n  But if you please to stay a-while,\r\n  Some shepheard for them will change the style.\r\n\r\n\"After some few daunces the Prince, not much liking the sporte (for\r\nthat most of them were out both in their speeches and measures, having\r\nbut thought of this devise some few houres before) rose, and lefte the\r\nhall, after whose departure, an honest fellow to breake of the sportes\r\nfor that night, and to void the company made suddenly this Epilogue:\r\n\r\n  These daunces were perform'd of yore\r\n  By many worthy Elfes,\r\n  Now if you will have any more\r\n  Pray shake your heeles your selves.\r\n\r\n\"The next day being Innocents-day, it was expected, and partly\r\ndetermined by our selves, that the Tragedy of _Philomela_ should have\r\nbeen publickly acted, which (as wee thought) would well have fitted\r\nthe day, by reason of the murder of Innocent Itis. But the carpenters\r\nbeing no way ready with the stage, or scaffolds (whereof\r\nnotwithstanding some were made before Christmas), wee were constrained\r\nto deferre it till the nexte day, which was the 29th of December.\r\n\r\nPHILOMELA.\r\n\r\nTereus, Rex Thraciae.\r\nProgne, Regina, Uxor Terei,\r\nEugenes, a consilijs Terei.\r\nPhaulus, Seruus Terei,\r\nTres Socii Terei a Classe,\r\nAncilla Prognes.\r\nPhilomela, Soror Prognes\r\nItis, Filius Pronges et Terei\r\nAncilla Philomelae.\r\nFaustulus, Pastor Regius.\r\nFaustula, Pastoris Filia.\r\n\r\nChorus.\r\n\r\nTerra\r\nMare.\r\n\r\n*     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\"The whole play was wel acted and wel liked.\r\n\r\n\"New-yeare's eve was wholly spent in preparation for the Prince's\r\ntriumphs, so that nothing was done or expected that night.\r\n\r\n\"Next day in the morning (beeing New-yeare's-day) the Prince sent Mr.\r\nRichard Swinnerton, one of the Squires of his body to Mr. President\r\nwith a paire of gloves, charging him to say nothing but these two\r\nverses:\r\n\r\n  The Prince and his Councell, in signe of their loves,\r\n  Present you, their President, with these paire of gloves.\r\n\r\n\"There was some what else written in the paper which covered them, but\r\nwhat it is uncertaine.\r\n\r\n\"At night were celebrated the Prince's triumphs, at which time onely\r\nand never before nor after he was carryed in full state from his\r\npallace to the hall, where in the sight of the whole University a\r\nsupplication was presented unto him by Time and seconded with a shew\r\ncalled _Times Complaint_.

for the\r\nPrologue (to the great prejudice of that which followed) was most\r\nshamefully out, and having but halfe a verse to say, so that by the\r\nvery sense the audience was able to prompt him in that which followed,\r\nyet hee could not goe forward, but after long stay and silence, was\r\ncompelled abruptly to leave the stage, whereupon beeing to play\r\nanother part, hee was so dasht, that hee did nothing well that night.\r\n\r\n\"After him Good-wife Spiggot, comming forth before her time, was most\r\nmiserably at a non plus & made others so also, whilst her selfe\r\nstaulked in the middest like a great Harry-Lion (as it pleased the\r\naudience to terme it), either saying nothing at all, or nothing to the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\"The drunken-man, which in the repetitions had much pleased and done\r\nvery well, was now so ambitious of his action, that he would needs\r\nmake his part much longer than it was, and stood so long upon it all,\r\nthat he grew most tedious, whereuppon it was well observed and said by\r\none that\r\n\r\n      ----'twas pitty there should bee\r\n  In any pleasing thing satiety.\r\n\r\n\"To make up the messe of absurdities the company had so fil'd the\r\nstage, that there was no roome to doe any thing well, to bee sure many\r\nthinges were mistaken and therefore could not but bee very\r\ndistastfull, for it was thought that particular men were aymed at, and\r\ndisciphered by the drunken-man, and Justice Bryar, though it was fully\r\nknowne to our-selves that the author had no such purpose.\r\n\r\n\"In fine, expectation the devourer of all good endeavours had\r\nswallowed more in the very name and title of the interlude than was\r\neither provided or intended in the whole matter, for wee onely\r\nproposed to our selves a shew, but the towne expected a perfect and\r\nabsolute play, so that all things mett to make us unhappy that night,\r\nand had not Time him selfe (whose lines and actions were thought good)\r\nsomewhat pleased them, they would never have endured us without\r\nhissing, howsoever in the end they gave us two or three cold\r\nplaudites, though they departed no way satisfyed, unlesse it were in\r\nthe shew about the quadrangle, wherein the Prince was carryd to his\r\nchamber in the same state that hee came from thence in the beginning\r\n(as is above mentioned), the whole company of actors beeing added to\r\nhis traine who immediately followed him before the guard in this\r\norder:\r\n\r\nFirst, Time alone, attended, with two pages and lightes.\r\n\r\nNext, Veritas alone, likewise attended.\r\n\r\nThen Error and Opinion, which all the way they went pull'd Veritas by\r\n  the sleeve, one by one and the other by the other, but shee would not\r\n  harken to them.\r\n\r\nAfter these came Studioso and Philonices, both pleading the case, one\r\n  upon his ringers and the other with both his hands.\r\n\r\nThen came Manco, the lame souldiour and Philonices his man; the\r\n  souldiour haulting without his cruch, the other beating him with the\r\n  cruch for counterfeyting.\r\n\r\nAfter these came Clinias and Bellicoso houlding the halter betwixt\r\n  them, which Bellicoso had found in Clinias his pocket.\r\n\r\nLast after these came Humphry Swallow and good wife Spiggot, hee\r\n  reeling uppon her, she pulling and hayling him for the money he\r\n  ought her.\r\n\r\nAfter these came the guard as before, and so the Prince in full state\r\n  was conveyed to his pallace.\r\n\r\n\"Here wee were all so discouraged that wee could have found in our\r\nheartes to have gone no farther. But then consulting with our selves\r\nwee thought it no way fitt to leave when thinges were at the worst,\r\nand therefore resolved by more industry and better care of those\r\nthings which should follow, to sue out a fine of recovery for our\r\ncredites. Whereuppon the comedy which was already a foote and\r\nappointed to bee done on 12 day, was revewed and corrected by the best\r\njudgments in the house, & a Chorus by their direction inserted, to\r\nexcuse former faults, all which was a cause that Twelfe eve & Twelfe\r\nday past away in silence, because the comedy beeing wholy altered\r\ncould not bee so soone acted, neyther could any other thing bee so\r\nsuddenly provided to furnish those nights.\r\n\r\n\"Heere the Lord-treasurer made a complaint to the King and the rest of\r\nhis councell that his treasure was poore and almost exhausted, so that\r\nwithout a fresh supply or new subsidy nothing more could bee done. And\r\nthat this might not seem an idle complaint, a bill of some of the\r\nparticulars and chiefe expences was exhibited, wherein it might\r\nappeare how costly the presedent revels had beene.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Bill of Expences\" amounted to lxiiij^{li} v^{s} o^{d}.\r\n\r\n\"This bill beeing seene and allowed, they begane to cast about for\r\nmore money, whereuppon a new privy seale was drawn in Latin.\" \"Those\r\nwhich were served with this writte and obey'd\" contributed a total sum\r\nof 5^{li}.\r\n\r\n\"This beeing not as yet sufficient there was a new subsedy levyed by\r\nthe Junior Masters and the rest of the Colledge to the summe of Six\r\nPoundes three shillings, whereuppon finding themselves againe before\r\nhand, and resolving to save nothing for a deare yeare, they proceeded\r\nto new expences and new troubles.\r\n\r\n\"The Suneday after, beeing the last day of the Vacation and tenth day\r\nof the moneth, two shewes were privately performed in the Lodging, the\r\none presently after dinner called _Somnium Fundatoris_, viz., the\r\ntradition that wee have concearning the three trees that wee have in\r\nthe President his garden.

Besides the season was so severe and tempestuous with\r\nwind and snow, which had continued some dayes without ceasing, and the\r\ncomplaint of the poore was so grievious for want of wood and meate,\r\nwhich by this time were growne very scant and deere, that they urged\r\nit was a time rather to lament and weepe than make sports in,\r\nwhereupon a streight inhibition was sent out from the officers, that\r\nno man should thinke of playing that night or any time after, till the\r\nweather should breake up and bee more temperate, for they thought it\r\nno way fitt publickly to revell at a time of such generall wo and\r\ncalamity.\r\n\r\n\"But yet because all thinges were in a readinesse and the expectation\r\nof the whole towne was set uppon that night, the younger men of the\r\nColledge went forward with their buisnes, intending to take no notice\r\nof what the officers had aggreed uppon, wherefore some of the officers\r\nwere fayne to come in person to forbid the worke-men, and to undo some\r\nthings which were already done, to the great griefe and discouragement\r\nof all the youth, who, though the weather was extreame cold, were\r\nthemselves most hotte uppon the matter in hand, resolving now or never\r\nto recover their losse credit.\r\n\r\n\"And, as though the heavens had favoured their designes, so it\r\nhappened that about noone the weather brake up and it begann to thaw,\r\nwhereuppon the President was agayne importun'd by the Prince himselfe\r\nand his councell for the performance of the Comedy that night; who\r\n(seeing they were all so earnest) did not so much graunt, as not deny\r\nthem, their request, whereuppon they begann againe to sett forward the\r\nbuisnes, and what they wanted in time they made up by their\r\nwillingnesse and paynes, so that for all these crosses they begann the\r\nplay before 7 a clocke and performed it in manner following:\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILOMATHES.\r\n\r\nINTERLOQUTORES.\r\n\r\nChorus.\r\n\r\nJanus.\r\nTempus.\r\n\r\nMotus       Locus.\r\nQuies       Vacuum.\r\n\r\nPhilomathes.

For the straungenes\r\nof the matter, and rarity of the fashion of their action pleased above\r\nexpectation.\r\n\r\n\"At the end of this shew for the more rarity, there was one brought in\r\nmy Lord's Stockes with this speech made uppon itt:\r\n\r\n\"'My Lord, I which am the lowest, am now become the lowdest, though\r\n(I hope) not the lewdest of your Lordshippe's servauntes.

Nay, I wil\r\nbee bould to compare it to your Lordshippe's braine, for what is there\r\ndesigned is heere executed. In these sells or ventricles are fancy,\r\nunderstanding, and memory. For such as your Lordshippe doth not fancy\r\nare put in the first hole, such as were dull and without understanding\r\nwere put in the second hole, but such as your Lordshippe threatned\r\n(remember this) or I'le remember you, were put in the last and lowest\r\ndungeon, _cum nemini obtrudi potest itur ad me_.

First the steward and buttler (who\r\nfor their auncient fidelity kept their places according as they had\r\nlong before beene appointed by the Colledge) were commaunded to bring\r\ntheir bookes, and by them to call up all the howse, whereupon (every\r\none beeing first charged to aunswere to his name) it presently\r\nappeared who were present and who were absent.\r\n\r\n\"After this the Master of the Revels and the Knight Marshall were\r\nwilled to appoint severall sportes that no man might bee seene idle\r\nupon payne of the Prince's high displeasure whereupon presently some\r\nwent to cardes, some to dice, some to dauncing, every one to some\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n\"Not long after, for more variety sake, there was brought in a maske;\r\nthe devise was sudden and extempore, videl: a little page attired in\r\nhis long coats, with these six verses which were spoke as soone as he\r\nentered the hall.\r\n\r\n \"These are six carpet knights, and I one page\r\n  Can easily bring in six that bee of age,\r\n  They come to visite this your highnes court,\r\n  And if they can, to make your honour sport.\r\n  Nay, this is all, for I have seene the day\r\n  A richer maske had not so much to say.\r\n\r\n\"After these maskers had finished the measures, and some few other\r\ndaunces, the said page waved them forth with his wan, and spake these\r\ntwo verses:\r\n\r\n \"There are three they say would shew you an anticke,\r\n  But when you see them, you'll thinke them franticke.\r\n\r\n\"Then there came in three in an anticke which were well attyred for\r\nthat purpose, and daunced well to the great delite of the beholders.\r\n\r\n\"After these had stollen away one by one, as the manner is, it pleased\r\nthe Prince to aske what was a clocke, it beeing aunswered almost\r\ntwelve hee presently called in for supper. But first the bill of those\r\nwhich were before noted to bee absent was called, to see whether any\r\nof them would yet appeare, and the Prince would deale favourably with\r\nthem. It was also examined whether any of those which were present\r\nbefore were now gon to bed, and accordingly authority was given by the\r\nPrince to the marshalls of the hall and other officers to search the\r\nchambers for sleepers, and where they made aunswere to aske the reason\r\nof their slothfull neglect or wilfull contempt of the Prince's\r\ncommands, and if they pleaded either infirmity or age to take their\r\nfine, and so quietly to depart, first causing them faithfull to give\r\ntheir words that they harboured no other idle or suspicious parsons.\r\nBut if they knoct at any of the chambers of those that were absent and\r\nnobody would answer, then they had full authority to breake open the\r\ndores and to make a privy search, and if they found any abed they\r\ntooke them as they were in their shirts and carryed them downe in\r\nstate to the hall after this manner:--\r\n\r\n\"First went the marshals with lights to make room.\r\n\r\nThen came one squire carrying the goune of him whom they\r\n     brought and another that carryed his hatt & band.\r\n\r\nThen came two other squires whereof one carryed his dublet\r\n     the other his breeches.\r\n\r\nThen came two with lights.\r\n\r\nNext came he that was in his shirt carryed by two in a chaire\r\n     and covered with a blanket.\r\n\r\nLast behind came one squire more that carryed his shoes &\r\n     stockings.\r\n\r\n\"All these beeing entered the hall, the squires made their attendance\r\nabout him, with great observance, every one reaching him his apparrell\r\nas it pleased him to call for it, and then also helping him on with\r\nit. And this was the punishment of those that were found a bed.\r\n\r\n\"Others which were found up in their chambers & would not answer were\r\nviolently brought downe with bills and staves as malefactors and by\r\nthe Knight Marshals appointment were committed close prisoners to the\r\nPrince's castle, videl. the stocks, which were placed upon a table to\r\nthat purpose, that those which were punished might bee seene to the\r\nterrour of others.\r\n\r\n\"By this time supper was ready and the sewer called to the\r\ndresser whereupon the buttery bell was presently rung, as it\r\nuses to bee at other ordinary meales, besides a trumpet was\r\nsounded at the kitchen hatch to call the wayters together.\r\n\r\n\"After the first messe was served in, the Prince with the rest\r\nof his councell satt downe, then all the rest of the howse in\r\nseniority.\r\n\r\n\"Towardes the end of supper two gentlemen of the second table fell out,\r\nwee could never distinctly know about what, it was verely supposed\r\nthemselves scarsly knew, but from wordes they fell suddenly to blowes,\r\nand ere any man was aware, one of them had stabbed the other into the\r\narme with his knife to the great prejudice of the mirth, which should or\r\nwould have followed that night. But the offender was presently\r\napprehended (and though a gentleman of some worth) put into my Lord's\r\nstocks, where hee lay most part of that night with shame and blame\r\nenough. And yet for all that punishment the next day he was convented\r\nbefore the officers of the Colledge, and there agayne more grievously\r\npunished; for the fault was much agravated by the circumstances of the\r\ntime, place and person that was hurt, who was a very worshipfull\r\nknight's sonne and heyre.\r\n\r\n\"After this the Prince with some of the better sort of the\r\nhowse beeing much disconted with the mischaunce that had\r\nhappened, retyred themselves into the president lodging, where\r\nprivatly they made themselves merry, with a wassall called the\r\nfive bells of Magdalen Church, because it was an auncient note\r\nof those bells, that they were almost never silent. This shew\r\nfor the better grace of the night was performed by some of the\r\nMasters and officers themselves in manner following:\r\n\r\n\"_Enter the Clerke of Magdalens alone,_\r\n\r\n \"Your kind acceptance of the late devise\r\n  Presented by St. Gyles's clerke, my neighbour,\r\n  Hath hartned mee to furnish in a trice\r\n  This nights up sitting with a two houres labour:\r\n      For any thing I hope, though ne're so naghty\r\n      Wil be accepted in a Vigilate.\r\n\r\n  I have observed as your sportes did passe all\r\n  (A fault of mine to bee too curious)\r\n  The twelfe night slipt away without a wassall,\r\n  A great defect, to custome most injurious:\r\n      Which I to mend have done my best endeavour\r\n      To bring it in, for better late than never.\r\n\r\n  And more, for our more tuneable proceeding,\r\n  I have ta'ne downe the five bells in our towre,\r\n  Which will performe it, if you give them heeding,\r\n  Most musically, though they ring an houre.--\r\n      Now I go in to oyle my bells and pruin them,\r\n      When I come downe Ile bring them downe & tune them.\r\n\r\n_Exit._\r\n\r\n\"After a while he returned with five others presenting his five bells,\r\nand tyed with five bell-ropes, which after he had pulled one by one,\r\nthey all began a peale, and sang in Latin as followeth:--\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Jam sumus laetis dapibus repleti,\r\n  Copiam vobis ferimus fluentem,\r\n  Gaudium vobis canimus jocose\r\n                          Vivite laeti.\r\n\r\n  Te deum dicunt (venerande Bacche)\r\n  Te deum dicunt (reverenda mater)\r\n  Vos graves vobis removete luctus:\r\n                          Vivite laeti.\r\n\r\n  Dat Ceres vires, hominumque firmat\r\n  Corpora, et Bacchus pater ille vini\r\n  Liberat curis animos molestis:\r\n                          Vivite laeti.\r\n\r\n  Ne dolor vestros animos fatiget,\r\n  Vos jubet laeta haec removere curas\r\n  Turba, laetari feriaeque suadent\r\n                          Vivite laeti.\r\n\r\n  En Ceres laetae segetis creatrix,\r\n  Et pater vini placidique somni\r\n  Pocula haec vobis hilares ministrant\r\n                               (monarcha\r\n                          Sume (\r\n                               (magister.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bibunt omnes ordine dum, actores haec ultima carmina saepius repetunt;\r\nmax singuli toti conventui sic ordine gratulantur._\r\n\r\n_Tenor._\r\n\r\n  Reddere faelicem si quemquam copia possit\r\n    Copia faelicis nomen habere jubet,\r\n  Copia laete jubet tristes depellere curas,\r\n    Copia quam cingit Bacchus et alma Ceres.\r\n\r\n_Counter._\r\n\r\n  Quem non delectant moderate pocula sumpta?\r\n\r\n_Tenor._\r\n\r\n    Cujus non animum dulcia vina juvant?\r\n  Dulcia vina juvant dulcem dant vina soporem,\r\n    Magnificas ornant dulcia vina dapes.\r\n\r\n_Meane._\r\n\r\n  Frugibus alma Ceres mortalia pectora nutrit,\r\n    Exornant campurn frugibus alma Ceres.\r\n  Si cuiquam desint Cerelia dona, nec illi\r\n    Lenaei patris munera grata placent.\r\n\r\n  Nec vobis Cereris nec Bacchi munera desint,\r\n    Annuat et votis Jupiter ipse meis.\r\n\r\n_Treble._\r\n\r\n  Alma Ceres vestris epulis laetatur, et ecce\r\n    Copia cum Baccho gaudia laeta canunt\r\n                 _Mox omnes cantantes Exeunt._\r\n\r\n  Gaudium laetum canimus, canemus\r\n  Hoc idem semper, nec enim dolere\r\n  Jam licet, laetae feriae hic aguntur\r\n                              Vivite laeti.\r\n\r\n  Saepius nobis reriae revertant,\r\n  Saepius vinum liceat potare,\r\n  Saepius vobis hilares canamus\r\n                            Vivite laeti.\r\n\r\n\"This then was suddenly and extempore clapt together for want of a\r\nbetter, but notwithstanding was as willingly and chearefully receaved\r\nas it was proferd.\r\n\r\n\"By this time it was foure a clocke and liberty was given to every one\r\nto goe to bed or stay up as long as they pleased. The Prince with his\r\ncouncell brake up their watch, so did most of the Masters of the\r\nhouse, but the younger sort stayed up till prayers time, and durst not\r\ngoe to bed for feare of one another. For some, after they had licence\r\nto depart, were fetcht out of their beds by their fellowes, and not\r\nsuffered to put on their clothes till they came into the hall. And\r\nthus the day came and made an end of the night's sport.\r\n\r\n\"On the sixt of February, beeing egge Satterday, it pleased some\r\ngentlemen schollers in the towne to make a dauncing night of it. They\r\nhad provided many new and curious daunces for the maske of Penelope's\r\nWoers, but the yeare beeing far spent and Lent drawing on and many\r\nother thinges to bee performed, the Prince was not able to bestow that\r\nstate upon them which their love & skill deserved. But their good will\r\nwas very kindely received by the Prince in this night's private\r\ntravels. They had some apparell suddenly provided for them, and these\r\nfew Latin verses for their induction:\r\n\r\n \"Isti fuere credo Penelopes proci\r\n  Quos justa forsan ira Telemachi domo\r\n  Expulit Ulyssis.\r\n\r\n\"After all this sport was ended the Prince entertayned them very\r\nroyally with good store of wine and a banquet, where they were very\r\nmerry and well pleased all that night.\r\n\r\n\"Against the next Tuesday following, beeing Shrovetuesday, the great\r\nstage was againe set up and the scaffolds built about the hall for the\r\nPrince's resignation, which was performed that night with great state\r\nand solemnity in manner and forme following:\r\n\r\nIRA SEU TUMULUS FORTUNE.\r\n\r\nINTERLOCUTORES.\r\n\r\nPrinceps.\r\nAdmiralius.\r\nThesaurarius.\r\nComptrollarius.\r\nCancellarius.\r\nJustitiarius.\r\nMarescallus.\r\nCamerarius.\r\nPhilosophus.\r\nCynicus.\r\nMomus.\r\nPolycrates.\r\nPhiladelphus.\r\nJuridicus.\r\nMagister Ludorem.\r\nAnteambulo Primus.\r\nAnteambulo Secundus.\r\nStultus.\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n\r\nMinerva\r\nEuphemia\r\nFortuna.\r\nTolmaea.\r\n\r\n*     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\"Many straungers of all sorts were invited to this shew, and many more\r\ncame together, for the name's sake only of a resignacon, to see the\r\nmanner and solemnity of it, for that it was reported (and truly) that\r\nthere was nothing els to bee done or seene beside the resignacon and\r\nno man thought so much could have beene said of so little matter.\r\n\r\n\"The stage was never so oppressed with company, insomuch that it was\r\nverely thought it could not bee performed that night for want of\r\nroome; but the audience was so favourable as to stand as close and\r\nyeeld as much backe as was possible; so that for all tumults it began\r\nabout 7 a clocke, and was very well liked of all.\r\n\r\n\"Only some few, more upon their owne guilty suspicion than our plaine\r\nintention, thinking themselves toucht at that verse of _Momus_:\r\n\r\n \"Dixi et quem dederat cursum fortuna peregi,\r\n\r\nlaboured to raise an hissing, but it was soon smothered, and the whole\r\ncompany in the end gave us good applause and departed very well\r\npleased.\r\n\r\n\"After the shew was ended, the sometimes Lord was carried in state to\r\nhis owne private chamber after this manner:\r\n\r\nFirst went two Squires with lights.\r\n\r\nNext Euphemia and Tolmaea.\r\n\r\nThen 2 other Squires with lightes.\r\n\r\nNext Minerva and Fortuna.\r\n\r\nThen came 4 other Squires with lightes, and in the midst of\r\n    them 4 schollers bearing on their shoulders a tombe\r\n    or sepulcher adorned with scutchions and little flagges,\r\n    wherein all the Prince's honours had bene buried before.\r\n\r\nAfter this came the Prince alone in his schollers gowne and\r\n    hood as the chiefe mourner.\r\n\r\nThen all the rest of his Counsell and company likewise in\r\n    blacke gownes and hoodes, like mourners, two by two.\r\n\r\n\"All these were said to goe to the Temple of Minerva there to\r\nconsecrate and erecte the sepulcher, and this state was very well\r\nliked of all that saw itt.\r\n\r\n\"Heere wee thought to have made an end of all, and to have puld downe\r\nthe scaffolds and stage, but then many said that so much preparacon\r\nwas too much for so small a show. Besides there was an English Tragedy\r\nalmost ready, which they were very earnest should bee performed, but\r\nmany arguments were alledged against it: first, for the time, because\r\nit was neere Lent, and consequently a season unfitt for\r\nplaies--Secondly, the stile for that itt was English, a language\r\nunfitt for the Universitie, especially to end so much late sporte with\r\nall--Thirdly, the suspicon of some did more hinder it than all the\r\nrest, for that it was thought that some particulars were aimed att in\r\nthe Chorus, which must needs bee distastfull--Lastly, the ill lucke,\r\nwhich wee had before with English, made many very loth to have any\r\nthing done againe in that straine.\r\n\r\n\"But these objections being aunswered all well as might bee, and\r\nfaithfull promise being made and taken that if any word were thought\r\npersonall, it should be presently put out, the stage was suffered to\r\nstand, and the scaffolds somewhat enlarged against the Saturday\r\nfollowing. Att which time such a concourse of people from all places,\r\nand of all sorts came together presently after dinner, that itt was\r\nthought impossible any thing should have beene done that night for\r\ntumults. Yet in the beginning such order and care was taken (every one\r\nbeing willing att the last cast to helpe towardes the making a good\r\nend,) that the stage was kept voide of all company, and the scaffoldes\r\nwere reserved for straungers and men sorte, better than ever they were\r\nbefore, so that it began very peaceably somewhat before six a clocke,\r\nand was performed in manner following:\r\n\r\nPERIANDER.\r\n\r\nCHORUS\r\n\r\nThe Master of the Revels.

The chiefest in the hall commaunded\r\nthat notice should be taken of him, that hee might afterwards bee\r\npunished for his boldnes;--but as soone as it at once appeared that he\r\nwas an actor, their disdaine and anger turned to much pleasure and\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\n\"All were so pleased att the whole course of this play, that there\r\nwere at least eight generall plaudites given in the midst of it in\r\ndivers places and to divers persons.\r\n\r\n\"In the end, they clapped their hands so long, that they went forth of\r\nthe colledge clapping.\r\n\r\n\"But in the midst of all this good liking wee were neere two\r\nmischaunces, the one from Lycophron who lost a faire gold ring from\r\nhis finger, which notwithstanding all the hurleburly in the end of the\r\nplay, was soone found againe; the other from Periander, who, going to\r\nkill his daughter Eugenia, did not so couch his dagger within his\r\nhand, but that hee prickt her through all her attire, but (as God\r\nwould have it) it was onely a scratch and so it passed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\"Many other thinges were in this yeare intended which neither were nor\r\ncould be performed. As the maske of Penelope's Wooer, with the State\r\nof Telemachus, with a Controversie of Jrus and his ragged Company,\r\nwhereof a great parte was made. The devise of the Embassage from\r\nLubber-land, whereof also a parte was made. The Creation of White\r\nKnights of the order of Aristotle's Well, which should bee sworne to\r\ndefend Aristotle against all authors, water against wine, footemen\r\nagainst horsemen, and many more such like injunctions. A lottery for\r\nthose of the colledge or straungers as itt pleased them to draw, not\r\nfor matters of wealth, but only of mirth and witt. The triumph of all\r\nthe founders of the colledges in Oxford, a devise much thought on, but\r\nit required more invention, more cost than the time would affoord. The\r\nholding of a court leet and baron for the Prince, wherein there should\r\nhave beene leasses drawne, copies taken, surrenders made, all which\r\nwere not so much neglected as prevented by the shortnes of time and\r\nwant of money, better wits and richer daies may hereafter make upp\r\nwhich was then lefte unperfect.\r\n\r\n\"Here some letters might be inserted, and other gratulatory messages\r\nfrom divers friends to the Prince, but it is high time to make an end\r\nof this tedious and fruitelesse relation, unlesse the knowledge of\r\ntrouble and vanity bee fruitefull.\r\n\r\n\"Wee intended in these exercises the practise and audacity of our\r\nyouth, the credit and good name of our colledge, the love and favor of\r\nthe University; but instead of all these (so easie a thing it is to be\r\ndeceived in a good meaning) wee met with peevishnesse at home,\r\nperversnes abroad, contradictions everywhere; some never thought\r\nthemselves entreated enough to their owne good and creditt; others\r\nthought themselves able to doe nothing if they could not thwarte and\r\nhinder something; most stood by and gave aime, willing to see much and\r\ndoe nothing, nay perchaunce they were ready to procure most trouble,\r\nwhich would bee sure to yield least helpe. And yet wee may not so much\r\ngrudge at faults at home as wee may justly complaine of hard measure\r\nabroad; for instead of the love and favour of the Universitie, wee\r\nfound our selves (wee will say justly) taxed for any the least error\r\n(though ingenious spirits would have pardoned many things, where all\r\nthings were intended for their owne pleasure) but most unjustly\r\ncensured, and envied for that which was done (wee dare say)\r\nindifferently well: so that, in a word, wee paide deere for trouble,\r\nand in a manner hired and sent for men to doe us wrong.\r\n\r\n\"Let others herafter take heed how they attempte the like, unlesse\r\nthey find better meanes at home, and better mindes abroad. And yet wee\r\ncannot complaine of all, some ment well and said well, and those tooke\r\ngood will for good paiment, good endevors for good performaunce, and\r\nsuch (in this kind) shall deserve a private favour, when other shal\r\nbee denied a common benefitt.\r\n\r\n \"_Seria vix recte agnoscit, qui ludicra nescit._\r\n\r\nFINIS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS TOURNAMENTS.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of James the First there was a revival of chivalric\r\nexercises, especially in connection with the training of the young\r\nPrince Henry. Almost as soon as he could wield a lance and manage his\r\nhorse when clothed in complete armour, he insisted on taking his place\r\nat the lists; and from this time no great tournament took place in\r\nEngland in which his Royal Highness did not take part. The most\r\nimportant of these exhibitions was\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND \"FEAT OF ARMES\"\r\n\r\nwhich took place on Twelfth Night, 1610, at the palace of Whitehall,\r\nin the presence of King James I. and his queen, and a brilliant\r\nassemblage of lords, ladies, and gentlemen, among whom were several\r\nforeign ambassadors, when the heir-apparent, Prince Henry, was in the\r\n16th year of his age, and therefore arrived at the period for claiming\r\nthe principality of Wales and the duchy of Cornwall. It was granted to\r\nhim by the king and the High Court of Parliament, and the 4th of June\r\nfollowing appointed for his investiture: \"the Christmas before which,\"\r\nSir Charles Cornwallis says, \"his highnesse, not onely for his owne\r\nrecreation, but also that the world might know what a brave prince\r\nthey were likely to enjoy, under the name of Meliades, lord of the\r\nisles, (an ancient title due to the first born of Scotland,) did, in\r\nhis name, by some appointed for the same purpose, strangely attired,\r\naccompanied with drummes and trumpets, in the presence, before the\r\nking and queene, and in the presence of the whole Court, deliver a\r\nchallenge to all knights of Great Britaine.\" The challenge was to this\r\neffect, \"That Meliades, their noble master, burning with an earnest\r\ndesire to trie the valour of his young yeares in foraigne countryes,\r\nand to know where vertue triumphed most, had sent them abroad to espy\r\nthe same, who, after their long travailes in all countreys, and\r\nreturne,\" had nowhere discovered it, \"save in the fortunate isle of\r\nGreat Britaine: which ministring matter of exceeding joy to their\r\nyoung Meliades, who (as they said) could lineally derive his pedegree\r\nfrom the famous knights of this isle, was the cause that he had now\r\nsent to present the first fruits of his chivalrie at his majesties'\r\nfeete: then after returning with a short speech to her majestie, next\r\nto the earles, lords, and knights, excusing their lord in this their\r\nso sudden and short warning, and, lastly, to the ladies; they, after\r\nhumble delivery of their chartle concerning time, place, conditions,\r\nnumber of weapons and assailants, tooke their leave, departing\r\nsolemnly as they entered.\"\r\n\r\nThen preparations began to be made for this great fight, and each was\r\nhappy who found himself admitted for a defendant, much more an\r\nassailant. \"At last to encounter his highness, six assailants, and\r\nfifty-eight defendants, consisting of earles, barons, knights, and\r\nesquires, were appointed and chosen; eight defendants to one\r\nassailant, every assailant being to fight by turnes eight several\r\ntimes fighting, two every time with push and pike of sword, twelve\r\nstrokes at a time; after which, the barre for separation was to be let\r\ndowne until a fresh onset.\" The summons ran in these words:\r\n\r\n\"To our verie loving good ffreind sir Gilbert Loughton, knight, geave\r\ntheis with speed:\r\n\r\n\"After our hartie commendacions unto you. The prince, his highnes,\r\nhath commanded us to signifie to you that whereas he doth intend to\r\nmake a challenge in his owne person at the Barriers, with six other\r\nassistants, to bee performed some tyme this Christmas; and that he\r\nhath made choice of you for one of the defendants (whereof wee have\r\ncomandement to give you knowledge), that theruppon you may so repaire\r\nhither to prepare yourselfe, as you may bee fitt to attend him.\r\nHereunto expecting your speedie answer wee rest, from Whitehall this\r\n25th of December, 1609. Your very loving friends,\r\n\r\nNottingham.    T. Suffolke.    E. Worcester.\"\r\n\r\nOn New Year's Day, 1610, or the day after, the Prince's challenge was\r\nproclaimed at court, and \"his highnesse, in his own lodging, in the\r\nChristmas, did feast the earles, barons, and knights, assailants and\r\ndefendants, until the great Twelfth appointed night, on which this\r\ngreat fight was to be performed.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of January, in the evening, \"the barriers\" were held at the\r\npalace of Whitehall, in the presence of the king and queen, the\r\nambassadors of Spain and Venice, and the peers and ladies of the land,\r\nwith a multitude of others assembled in the banquetting-house: at the\r\nupper end whereof was the king's chair of state, and on the right a\r\nsumptuous pavilion for the prince and his associates, whence, \"with\r\ngreat bravery and ingenious devices, they descended into the middell\r\nof the roome, and there the prince performed his first feates of\r\narmes, that is to say, at _Barriers_, against all commers, being\r\nassisted onlie with six others, viz., the duke of Lenox, the earle of\r\nArundell, the earle of Southampton, the lord Hay, sir Thomas Somerset,\r\nand sir Richard Preston, who was shortly afterwards created lord\r\nDingwell.\"\r\n\r\nTo answer these challengers came fifty-six earles, barons, knights,\r\nand esquiers. They were at \"the lower end of the roome, where was\r\nerected a very delicat and pleasant place, where in privat manner they\r\nand their traine remained, which was so very great that no man\r\nimagined that the place could have concealed halfe so many.\" Thence\r\nthey issued in comely order, \"to the middell of the roome, where sate\r\nthe king and the queene, and the court, to behold the barriers, with\r\nthe several showes and devices of each combatant.\" Every challenger\r\nfought with eight several defendants two several combats at two\r\nseveral weapons, viz. at push of pike, and with single sword. \"The\r\nprince performed this challenge with wonderous skill and courage, to\r\nthe great joy and admiration of the beholders,\" he \"not being full\r\nsixteene yeeres of age until the 19th of February.\" These feats, and\r\nother \"triumphant shewes,\" began before ten o'clock at night, and\r\ncontinued until three o'clock in the morning, \"being Sonday.\" The\r\nspeeches at \"the barriers\" were written by Ben Jonson. The next day\r\n(Sunday) the prince rode in great pomp to convoy the king to St.\r\nJames', whither he had invited him and all the court to supper, the\r\nqueen alone being absent; and then the prince bestowed prizes to the\r\nthree combatants best deserving; namely, the Earl of Montgomery, Sir\r\nThomas Darey (son of Lord Darey), and Sir Robert Gourdon. Thus ended\r\nthe Twelftide court festivities in 1610.\r\n\r\nDuring the early years of James's reign tournaments divided with\r\nmasques the favour of the Court; and, as we have just seen when Prince\r\nHenry reached his sixteenth year, he put himself forth in a more\r\nheroic manner than usual with princes of his time to engage in \"feats\r\nof armes\" and chivalric exercises; but after his death (1612) these\r\nsports fell quite out of fashion, and George Wither, a poet of the\r\nperiod, expresses, in the person of Britannia, the feelings of the\r\nnation:--\r\n\r\n \"Alas! who now shall grace my tournaments,\r\n  Or honour me with deeds of chivalry?\r\n  What shall become of all my merriments,\r\n  My ceremonies, shows of heraldry,\r\n  And other rites?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nReligious matters received a good deal of attention from James I. in\r\nthe later years of his reign, and his Majesty's proposals raised the\r\nquestion of the observance of\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTMAS FESTIVAL IN SCOTLAND.\r\n\r\nIn 1617 the King made a journey to Scotland with the object of\r\nestablishing the English Church in all its forms and authority as the\r\nState Church of Scotland for ever. One of the famous Five Articles in\r\nwhich the King set forth his will proposed \"That the festivals of\r\nChristmas, Good Friday, Easter, Ascension Day, and Whit Sunday, should\r\nbe observed in Scotland just as in England.\" The Articles were\r\nreceived with unequivocal marks of displeasure, many of the churches\r\nrefusing to obey the royal command, and the revival of the festival of\r\nChristmas was denounced as the return of the ancient Saturnalia. Three\r\nyears later the King obtained an Act of Parliament enforcing the\r\nArticles on the repugnant spirit of the people. \"Dr. Laud, whose name\r\nwe now meet for the first time, afterwards to become so notorious,\r\neven urged James to go further lengths; but his fatal advice was\r\ndestined to act with more force on the next generation.\"[63]\r\n\r\nThe King returned to London very much displeased with the religious\r\nviews of his Scotch subjects, and his sourness seems to have\r\nmanifested itself even at Christmastide, for on December 20th of this\r\nyear Mr. Chamberlaine thus wrote to Sir Dudley Carleton: \"The King\r\nhath been at Theobald's ever since Wednesday, and came to town this\r\nday. I am sorry to hear that he grows every day more froward, and with\r\nsuch a kind of morosity, that doth either argue a great discontent in\r\nmind, or a distemper of humours in his body. Yet he is never so out of\r\ntune but the very sight of my Lord of Buckingham doth settle and quiet\r\nall.\"[64]\r\n\r\nSo soothed and softened was the King by \"my Lord of Buckingham\" that\r\nMr. Chamberlaine, writing again on the 3rd of January, says that on\r\nNew Year's Day the earl was created \"Marquis of Buckingham, a dignity\r\nthe King hath not bestowed since his coming to this crown.\" And, says\r\nthe same writer, \"This night was the Lord Marquiss's [Buckingham's]\r\ngreat\r\n\r\n\r\nFEAST, WHERE WERE THE KING AND PRINCE,\r\n\r\nwith Lords and Ladies _sans nombre_. You may guess at the rest of the\r\ncheer by this scantling, that there were said to be seventeen dozen of\r\npheasants, and twelve partridges in a dish throughout; which methinks\r\nwas rather spoil than largess; yet for all the plenty of presents, the\r\nsupper cost L600. Sir Thomas Edmondes undertook the providing and\r\nmanaging of all, so that it was much after the French. The King was\r\nexceedingly pleased, and could not be satisfied with commending the\r\nmeat and the Master; and yet some stick not to say, that young Sir\r\nHenry Mildmay, a son of George Brooke, that was executed at\r\nWinchester, and a son of Sir William Monson's, begins to come into\r\nconsideration.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAILING HEALTH OF THE KING\r\n\r\ninterfered somewhat with the celebration of the subsequent Royal\r\nChristmases of this reign; and Nichols, referring to the Court\r\ncelebrations of Twelfth Day, 1620-1, says:\r\n\r\n\"'On Twelfth Day the King went to Chappel, but they had much ado to\r\nsupport him. He offered gold, frankincence, and myrrhe, and touched 80\r\nof the evil.'[65] In the evening 'the French Ambassador and his choise\r\nfollowers were brought to court by the Earle of Warwick to be present\r\nat a Maske; he seated as before with the King, the better sort of the\r\nother on a fourme behind the Lords, the Lord Treasurer onely and the\r\nMarquesse of Hamilton sitting at the upper end of it, and all the rest\r\nin a box, and in the best places of the scaffolds on the right hand of\r\nhis Majesty. No other Ambassadors were at that time present or\r\ninvited.'\"\r\n\r\nAs to\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTMAS FESTIVITIES\r\n\r\nof the next year (1621-2) Nichols[66] says Mr. Meade wrote thus to Sir\r\nMartin Stuteville:--\r\n\r\n\"'The Lieutenant of Middle Temple played a game this Christmas-time,\r\nwhereat his Majesty was highly displeased. He made choise of some\r\nthirty of the civillest and best-fashioned gentlemen of the House to\r\nsup with him; and, being at supper, took a cup of wine in one hand,\r\nand held his sword drawn in the other, and so began a health to the\r\ndistressed Lady Elizabeth [the Queen of Bohemia], and having drunk,\r\nkissed his sword, and laying his hand upon it, took an oath to live\r\nand die in her service; then delivered the cup and sword to the next,\r\nand so the health and ceremonie went round.\r\n\r\n\"'The Gentlemen of Graye's Inne, to make an end of Christmas on\r\nTwelfe-night, in the dead time of the night, shot off all the chambers\r\nthey had borrowed from the Tower, being as many as filled four carts.\r\nThe King, awakened with this noise, started out of his bed, and cryed,\r\n\"Treason, treason,\" &c., and that the Cittie was in an uprore, in such\r\nsort (as it is told) that the whole court was raised and almost in\r\narmes, the Earle of Arundell running to the Bed-chamber with his sword\r\ndrawne as to rescue the King's person.'\"\r\n\r\nIn this reign many accomplished writers assisted in the Christmas\r\nfestivities. Professor Henry Morley[67] mentions that in December,\r\n1623, the name of Philip Massinger, poet and dramatist, first appeared\r\nin the office book of the Master of the Revells, when his \"Bondman\"\r\nwas acted, and the play was first printed in 1624.\r\n\r\nKing James I. died at Theobald's, Herts, on the 27th March, 1625, and\r\nwas buried in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n\r\nKING JAMES I. AND BISHOP ANDREWES ON CHRISTMAS DAYS.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable fact that Bishop Andrewes preached seventeen sermons on\r\nthe Nativity before James I. gives an unusual interest to the\r\nChristmas Day services of this reign. Nichols makes the following\r\nreferences to them:--\r\n\r\n1605. \"On Christmas Day the King attended Divine Service at Whitehall,\r\nwhere Dr Lancelot Andrews, then recently promoted to the Bishoprick of\r\nChichester, preached before his Majesty, on the Epistle of St. Paul to\r\nthe Hebrews, ii. 16.\"\r\n\r\n1606. \"On Christmas Day, the King attended Divine Service at\r\nWhitehall, where Bishop Andrews, now decidedly the King's favourite\r\nPreacher, discoursed on Esaias ix. 6.\"\r\n\r\n1607. \"On Thursday, being Christmas Day, the King attended Divine\r\nService at Whitehall, and there heard Bishop Andrews preach on 1 Tim.\r\niii. 16.\"\r\n\r\n1609. \"Monday, December 25, being Christmas Day, the King attended\r\nDivine Service at Whitehall, and there heard the Bishop of Ely, Dr.\r\nAndrews, on Galat. iv. 4, 5.\" In a note Nichols says: \"This sermon was\r\nmuch admired by the King. This was probably the reason that it was\r\nprinted in 1610, together with that the Bishop preached on the same\r\noccasion in that year, under the following title: 'Two Sermons\r\npreached before the King's Majestie at Whitehall; of the Birth of\r\nChrist; the one on Christmas Day, anno 1609, the other on Christmas\r\nDay last, anno 1610. By the Bishop of Elie, his Majestie's Almoner.\r\nImprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the King's most\r\nexcellent Majestie, anno 1610.'\"\r\n\r\n1610. \"On Tuesday, the 25th December, Christmas Day, the King attended\r\nDivine Service at Whitehall, where Bishop Andrews preached on Luke ii.\r\n9, 10.\"\r\n\r\n1611. \"On Christmas Day the King attended Divine Service at Whitehall,\r\nand Bishop Andrews preached on John. i. 14.\"\r\n\r\n1612. \"On Friday, 25th December, Christmas Day was kept as usual at\r\nWhitehall; where the King attended Divine Service, and Bishop Andrews\r\n(as usual) preached.\"\r\n\r\n1613. \"Saturday, 25th December, being Christmas Day, was kept with the\r\nusual solemnities; the King attended Divine service at Whitehall, and\r\nBishop Andrews preached.\"\r\n\r\n1614. \"His Majesty returned to keep Christmas Day, as was customary,\r\nat Whitehall. Bishop Andrews addressed him from the pulpit as usual.\"\r\n\r\n1615. \"'On Christmas Day, the King, being sorely troubled with the\r\ngout, was not able to go to Divine service; but heard a sermon in\r\nprivate, and took the Sacrament.' The Preacher was, as usual, Bishop\r\nAndrews.\"\r\n\r\n1616. \"On Christmas Day, Thomas, Earl of Arundel, who was educated\r\nfrom his youth in the Popish Religion, and had lately travelled all\r\nover Italy detesting the abuses of the Papists, embraced the\r\nProtestant religion, and received the Sacrament in the King's Chapel\r\nat Whitehall, where Bishop Andrews preached, as was customary, a\r\nsermon suited to the Festival of the Nativity.\"\r\n\r\n1618. \"On the 25th [December], Bishop Andrews resumed his post as\r\npreacher on Christmas Day, before the King at Whitehall. His text was\r\nfrom Luke ii. 12, 13.\"\r\n\r\n1619. \"Christmas was kept by the King at Whitehall, as had ever been\r\nhis practice; and Bishop Andrews preached then before him, on\r\nSaturday, the 25th.\"\r\n\r\n1620. \"During the month of December, before the King left the country,\r\nhe knighted at Newmarket, Sir Francis Michell, afterward degraded in\r\nJune 1621; and at Theobalds, Sir Gilbert Cornwall. On the 23rd, his\r\nMajestie 'came to Westminster, but went not to Chappel, being\r\nprevented by the gout.' On Monday, the 25th, however, being Christmas\r\nDay, Bishop Andrews preached before him at Whitehall, on Matt. ii. 1,\r\n2; and during Christmas, Sir Clement Cotterell and Sir Henry Carvell\r\nwere there knighted.\"\r\n\r\n1622. \"On the 25th [December] Bishop Andrews resumed his Christmas\r\nstation in the pulpit at Whitehall, and thence preached to the King\r\nand his Court on the same text as he had adopted on the same occasion\r\ntwo years before, Matt. ii. 1, 2.\"\r\n\r\n1623. \"The King kept inviolate his old custom of being at Whitehall on\r\nChristmas Day, and hearing there a sermon from Bishop Andrews, who\r\nthis year preached on Ephes. i. 10.\"\r\n\r\n1624. \"On Saturday, the 25th of December, Bishop Andrews preached\r\nbefore his Majesty at Whitehall, on Psalm ii. 7, it being at least the\r\nseventeenth, as it was the last, Christmas Day on which King James\r\nheard that favourite preacher.\"\r\n\r\nThe unique series of \"Seventeen Sermons on the Nativity, preached\r\nbefore King James I. at Whitehall, by the Right Honourable and\r\nReverend Father in God, Lancelot Andrewes, sometime Lord Bishop of\r\nWinchester,\" were preserved to posterity by an order of Charles I.,\r\nwho, after Bishop Andrewes's death, commanded Bishops Laud and\r\nBuckeridge to collect and publish his sermons. This series of sermons\r\non the Nativity have recently been reprinted in \"The Ancient and\r\nModern Library of Theological Literature,\" and the editor, after\r\nreferring to the ability and integrity of Bishop Andrewes, says: \"An\r\ninterest apart from that which must be created by his genius,\r\nlearning, and character, belongs to him as the exponent of the mind\r\nand practice of the English Church in the years that intervened\r\nbetween the Reformation and the Revolution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POPULAR AMUSEMENTS OF CHRISTMASTIDE\r\n\r\nat this period are thus enumerated by Robert Burton in his \"Anatomy of\r\nMelancholy,\" published in 1621:--\r\n\r\n\"The ordinary recreations which we have in winter are cards, tables\r\nand dice, shovelboard, chess-play, the philosopher's game, small\r\ntrunks, billiards, music, masks, singing, dancing, ule games, catches,\r\npurposes, questions; merry tales of errant knights, kings, queens,\r\nlovers, lords, ladies, giants, dwarfs, thieves, fairies, goblins,\r\nfriars, witches, and the rest.\"\r\n\r\nThe following curious cut is from the title-page of the amusing story\r\nof the great \"Giant Gargantua\" of this period:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Giant Gargantua\"]\r\n\r\nThe legends of Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, Bevis of\r\nSouthampton, Guy of Warwick, Adam Bell, and Clymme of Clough, were\r\nfavourites among the lovers of romance; but the people of this age,\r\nbeing very superstitious, were very fond of stories about ghosts and\r\ngoblins, believing them to be founded on fact, and also attributing\r\nfeats performed by conjurors and jugglers to supernatural agency. The\r\nKing himself was equally superstitious, for Strutt in describing the\r\ntricks of jugglers says: \"Our learned monarch, James I., was perfectly\r\nconvinced that these, and other inferior feats exhibited by the\r\ntregetours, could only be performed by the agency of the devil, 'who,'\r\nsays he, 'will learne them many juglarie tricks, at cardes and dice,\r\nto deceive men's senses thereby, and such innumerable false\r\npractiques, which are proved by over-many in this age.'\"[68]\r\n\r\nLooking back to the ancient superstitions about ghosts and fairies,\r\nDryden, the poet, has some lines which may fitly close this chapter:--\r\n\r\n \"I speak of ancient times, for now the swain\r\n  Returning late may pass the woods in vain,\r\n  And never hope to see the mighty train;\r\n  In vain the dairy now with mint is dressed,\r\n  The dairy-maid expects no fairy guest,\r\n  To skim the bowls and after pay the feast.\r\n  She sighs and shakes her empty shoes in vain,\r\n  No silver penny to reward her pain:\r\n  For priests, with prayers and other godly gear,\r\n  Have made the merry goblins disappear.\"\r\n\r\n    [58] \"Curiosities of Literature.\"\r\n\r\n    [59] \"Memoirs of Ben Jonson.\"\r\n\r\n    [60] \"Progresses of King James the First.\"\r\n\r\n    [61] Cassell's \"History of England.\"\r\n\r\n    [62] This portion is inserted to introduce _the Prince's\r\n    Triumph_, as they are termed.\r\n\r\n    [63] Cassell's \"History of England.\"\r\n\r\n    [64] Nichols's \"Progresses.\"\r\n\r\n    [65] \"Camden's Annals.\"\r\n\r\n    [66] \"Progresses.\"\r\n\r\n    [67] \"Library of English Literature.\"\r\n\r\n    [68] \"Daemonologie,\" by King James I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS UNDER CHARLES I. AND THE\r\nCOMMONWEALTH.\r\n\r\n(1625-1660.)\r\n\r\n\r\nKING CHARLES THE FIRST\r\n\r\nwas the second son of James I. and of Anne, daughter of Frederick\r\nIII., King of Denmark, and he came to the throne on the death of his\r\nfather in March 1625. As Prince Charles he had taken part in the Court\r\nentertainments of Christmastide, and had particularly distinguished\r\nhimself in Ben Jonson's masque, \"The Vision of Delight.\" These\r\nmagnificent Christmas masques were continued after Charles's accession\r\nto the throne until the troubles of his reign stopped them.\r\nGifford[69] mentions that Jonson's \"Masque of Owls\" was presented at\r\nKenilworth Castle, \"By the Ghost of Captain Cox mounted on his\r\nHobby-horse, in 1626\":--\r\n\r\n\"_Enter_ Captain Cox, _on his Hobby-horse._\r\n\r\n  Room! room! for my horse will wince,\r\n  If he come within so many yards of a prince;\r\n  And though he have not on his wings,\r\n  He will do strange things,\r\n  He is the Pegasus that uses\r\n  To wait on Warwick Muses;\r\n  And on gaudy-days he paces\r\n  Before the Coventry Graces;\r\n  For to tell you true, and in rhyme,\r\n  He was foal'd in Queen Elizabeth's time,\r\n  When the great Earl of Lester\r\n  In this castle did feast her.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOBBY-HORSE.]\r\n\r\nJonson's \"The Fortunate Isles, and Their Union,\" a masque designed for\r\nthe Court, was presented on Twelfth Night, 1626; and \"Love's Triumph\r\nthrough Callipolis\" (a masque invented by Ben Jonson and Inigo Jones)\r\nwas presented at Court in 1630.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LORD OF MISRULE\r\n\r\nalso made merry at Christmas at this period; but it sometimes happened\r\nthat when he went forth with his band of merry men, they got into\r\ntrouble. An instance of this, which occurred in 1627, is recorded in\r\none of Meade's letters to Sir Martin Stuteville. The letter is worth\r\nreprinting as an illustration of the manners of the age, and as\r\nrelating to what was probably the last Lord of Misrule elected by the\r\nbarristers. Meade writes:--\"On Saturday the Templars chose one Mr.\r\nPalmer their Lord of Misrule, who, on Twelfth-eve, late in the night,\r\nsent out to gather up his rents at five shillings a house in Ram-alley\r\nand Fleet Street. At every door they came to they winded the\r\nTemple-horn, and if at the second blast or summons they within opened\r\nnot the door, then the Lord of Misrule cried out, 'Give fire, gunner!'\r\nHis gunner was a robustious Vulcan, and the gun or petard itself was a\r\nhuge overgrown smith's hammer. This being complained of to my Lord\r\nMayor, he said he would be with them about eleven o'clock on Sunday\r\nnight last; willing that all that ward should attend him with their\r\nhalberds, and that himself, besides those that came out of his house,\r\nshould bring the watches along with him. His lordship, thus attended,\r\nadvanced as high as Ram-alley in martial equipage: when forth came the\r\nLord of Misrule, attended by his gallants, out of the Temple-gate,\r\nwith their swords all armed _in cuerpo_. A halberdier bade the Lord of\r\nMisrule come to my Lord Mayor. He answered, No! let the Lord Mayor\r\ncome to me! At length they agreed to meet halfway: and, as the\r\ninterview of rival princes is never without danger of some ill\r\naccident, so it happened in this: for first, Mr. Palmer being\r\nquarrelled with for not pulling off his hat to my Lord Mayor, and\r\ngiving cross answers, the halberds began to fly about his ears, and he\r\nand his company to brandish their swords. At last being beaten to the\r\nground, and the Lord of Misrule sore wounded, they were fain to yield\r\nto the longer and more numerous weapon. My Lord Mayor taking Mr.\r\nPalmer by the shoulder, led him to the Compter, and thrust him in at\r\nthe prison-gate with a kind of indignation; and so, notwithstanding\r\nhis hurts, he was forced to lie among the common prisoners for two\r\nnights. On Tuesday the King's attorney became a suitor to my Lord\r\nMayor for their liberty: which his lordship granted, upon condition\r\nthat they should repay the gathered rents, and do reparations upon\r\nbroken doors. Thus the game ended. Mr. Attorney-General, being of the\r\nsame house, fetched them in his own coach, and carried them to the\r\ncourt, where the King himself reconciled my Lord Mayor and them\r\ntogether with joining all hands; the gentlemen of the Temple being\r\nthis Shrovetide to present a Mask to their majesties, over and besides\r\nthe King's own great Mask, to be performed at the Banquetting-house by\r\nan hundred actors.\"\r\n\r\nWe get other glances at\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTMAS FESTIVITIES IN THE 17TH CENTURY\r\n\r\nthrough contemporary writers of the period. Nicholas Breton,[70]\r\nwriting in merry mood, says: \"It is now Christmas, and not a cup of\r\ndrink must pass without a carol; the beasts, fowl, and fish come to a\r\ngeneral execution, and the corn is ground to dust for the bakehouse\r\nand the pastry: cards and dice purge many a purse, and the youth show\r\ntheir agility in shoeing of the wild mare: now, good cheer, and\r\nwelcome, and God be with you, and I thank you:--and against the New\r\nYear provide for the presents:--The Lord of Misrule is no mean man for\r\nhis time, and the guests of the high table must lack no wine: the\r\nlusty bloods must look about them like men, and piping and dancing\r\nputs away much melancholy: stolen venison is sweet, and a fat coney is\r\nworth money: pit-falls are now set for small birds, and a woodcock\r\nhangs himself in a gin: a good fire heats all the house, and a full\r\nalms-basket makes the beggar's prayers:--the maskers and the mummers\r\nmake the merry sport, but if they lose their money their drum goes\r\ndead: swearers and swaggerers are sent away to the ale-house, and\r\nunruly wenches go in danger of judgment; musicians now make their\r\ninstruments speak out, and a good song is worth the hearing. In sum it\r\nis a holy time, a duty in Christians for the remembrance of Christ and\r\ncustom among friends for the maintenance of good fellowship. In brief\r\nI thus conclude it: I hold it a memory of the Heaven's love and the\r\nworld's peace, the mirth of the honest, and the meeting of the\r\nfriendly. Farewell.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1633, William Prynne, a Puritan lawyer, published his\r\n\"Histriomastix,\" against plays, masques, balls, the decking of houses\r\nwith evergreens at Christmas, &c., for which he was committed to the\r\nTower, prosecuted in the Star Chamber, and sentenced to pay a fine to\r\nthe King of L5,000, to be expelled from the University of Oxford, from\r\nthe Society of Lincoln's Inn, and from his profession of the law; to\r\nstand twice in the pillory, each time losing an ear; to have his book\r\nburnt before his face by the hangman; and to suffer perpetual\r\nimprisonment: a most barbarous sentence, which Green[71] says, \"showed\r\nthe hard cruelty of the Primate.\"\r\n\r\nMilton's masque of \"Comus\" was produced the following year (1634) for\r\nperformance at Ludlow Castle, in Shropshire, which was the seat of\r\ngovernment for the Principality of Wales, the Earl of Bridgewater\r\nbeing then the Lord President, and having a jurisdiction and military\r\ncommand that comprised the English counties of Gloucester, Worcester,\r\nHereford and Shropshire. Ludlow Castle was to the Lord President of\r\nWales of that period what Dublin Castle is to the Lord Lieutenant of\r\nIreland in the present day; and, as hospitality was one of the duties\r\nof the Lord President's office, the Earl and Countess of Bridgewater\r\ngave a grand entertainment to the country people, in which the masque\r\nof \"Comus\" was an important feature. The music was composed by the\r\neminent musician Henry Lawes, and the masque was adapted for\r\nperformance by the family of the earl and countess, who then had ten\r\nchildren--eight daughters and two sons.\r\n\r\nIt is quite refreshing to think of the author of \"Paradise Lost,\" with\r\nhis friend Lawes, the musician, among the country dancers, listening\r\nto the song of the attendant spirit:--\r\n\r\n \"Back, shepherds, back; enough your play\r\n  Till next sun-shine holiday:\r\n  Here be, without duck or nod,\r\n  Other trippings to be trod\r\n  Of lighter toes, and such court guise\r\n  As Mercury did first devise\r\n  With the mincing Dryades,\r\n  On the lawns, and on the leas.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Milton was a courtier when he wrote the Masque at Ludlow Castle,\"\r\nsays Charles Lamb, \"and still more of a courtier when he composed the\r\n'Arcades'\" (a masque, or entertainment presented to the Countess\r\nDowager of Derby, at Harefield, by some noble persons of her family).\r\n\"When the national struggle was to begin, he becomingly cast these\r\nvarieties behind him.\"\r\n\r\nFrom \"Archaeologia\" (vol. xviii. p. 335), we learn that \"Richard\r\nEvelyn, Esq., High Sheriff of Surrey and Sussex in 1634, held a\r\nsplendid Christmas at his mansion at Wotton, having a regular Lord of\r\nMisrule for the occasion: and it appears it was then the custom for\r\nthe neighbours to send presents of eatables to provide for the great\r\nconsumption consequent upon such entertainments. The following is a\r\nlist of those sent on this occasion: two sides of venison, two half\r\nbrawns, three pigs, ninety capons, five geese, six turkeys, four\r\nrabbits, eight partridges, two pullets, five sugar loaves, half a\r\npound of nutmeg, one basket of apples, two baskets of pears.\"\r\n\r\nHone[72] states that \"in the ninth year of King Charles I. the four\r\nInns of Court provided a Christmas mask, which cost L2,400, and the\r\nKing invited a hundred and twenty gentlemen of the four Inns to a mask\r\nat Whitehall on Shrove Tuesday following.\" And Sandys says that on the\r\n13th December, 1637, a warrant under Privy Seal was issued to George\r\nKirke, for L150 to provide masking apparel for the King; and on the\r\n1st of the same month Edmund Taverner had a warrant for L1,400 towards\r\nthe charge of a mask to be presented at Whitehall the next Twelfth\r\nNight. A similar sum for a similar purpose was granted to Michael\r\nOldisworth on the 3rd of January, 1639.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the entertainments at the Inns of Court, Sandys\r\nmentions that by an order, 17th November, 4th Charles I., all playing\r\nat dice, cards, or otherwise was forbidden at Gray's Inn, except\r\nduring the 20 days in Christmas.\r\n\r\nAs indicating the prolongation of the Christmas revels at this period,\r\nit is recorded that in February, 1633, there was a celebrated masque,\r\ncalled \"The Triumph of Peace,\" presented jointly by the two Temples,\r\nLincoln's Inn and Gray's Inn, which cost the Societies about L20,000.\r\nEvelyn, in his \"Memoirs,\" relates, that on the 15th December, 1641, he\r\nwas elected one of the Comptrollers of the Middle Temple revellers,\r\n\"as the custom of ye young students and gentlemen was, the Christmas\r\nbeing kept this yeare with greate solemnity\"; but he got excused.\r\n\r\nAn order still existed directing the nobility and gentry who had\r\nmansions in the country \"to repair to them to keep hospitality meet to\r\ntheir degrees;\" for a note in Collier's History states that Sir J.\r\nAstley, on the 20th of March, 1637, in consequence of ill-health,\r\nobtained a license to reside in London, or where he pleased, at\r\nChristmas, or any other times; which proves such license to have been\r\nrequisite.\r\n\r\nAt this period noblemen and gentlemen lived like petty princes, and in\r\nthe arrangement of their households copied their sovereign, having\r\nofficers of the same import, and even heralds wearing their coat of\r\narms at Christmas, and other solemn feasts, crying largesse thrice at\r\nthe proper times. They feasted in their halls where many of the\r\nChristmas sports were performed. When coals were introduced the hearth\r\nwas commonly in the middle, whence, according to Aubrey, is the\r\nsaying, \"Round about our coal-fire.\" Christmas was considered as the\r\ncommemoration of a holy festival, to be observed with cheerfulness as\r\nwell as devotion. The comforts and personal gratification of their\r\ndependants were provided for by the landlords, their merriment\r\nencouraged, and their sports joined. The working man looked forward to\r\nChristmas as the time which repaid his former toils; and gratitude for\r\nworldly comforts then received caused him to reflect on the eternal\r\nblessings bestowed on mankind by the event then commemorated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SERVANTS' CHRISTMAS FEAST.]\r\n\r\nOf all our English poets, Robert Herrick, a writer of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, has left us the most complete contemporary picture of the\r\nChristmas season. He was born in Cheapside, London, and received his\r\nearly education, it is supposed, at Westminster School, whence he\r\nremoved to Cambridge, and after taking his M.A. degree in 1620, left\r\nCambridge. He afterwards spent some years in London in familiar\r\nintercourse with the wits and writers of the age, enjoying those\r\n\"lyric feasts\" which are celebrated in his \"Ode to Ben Jonson\":--\r\n\r\n                 \"Ah Ben!\r\n             Say how or when\r\n           Shall we, thy guests\r\n         Meet at those lyric feasts\r\n             Made at the Sun,\r\n        The Dog, the Triple Tun;\r\n       Where we such clusters had\r\n     As made us nobly wild, not mad?\r\n       And yet each verse of thine\r\n   Outdid the meat, outdid the frolic wine.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1629 he accepted the living of Dean Prior, in Devonshire, where he\r\nlived as a bachelor Vicar, being ejected by the Long Parliament,\r\nreturning on the Restoration under Charles the Second, and dying at\r\nlength at the age of eighty-four. He was buried in the Church at Dean\r\nPrior, where a memorial tablet has latterly been erected to his\r\nmemory. And it is fitting that he should die and be buried in the\r\nquiet Devonshire hamlet from which he drew so much of his happiest\r\ninspiration, and which will always be associated now with the endless\r\ncharm of the \"Hesperides.\"\r\n\r\nIn \"A New Year's Gift, sent to Sir Simeon Steward,\" included in his\r\n\"Hesperides,\" Herrick refers to the Christmas sports of the time, and\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n \"No new device or late-found trick\r\n\r\n  *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n  We send you; but here a jolly\r\n  Verse crowned with ivy and with holly;\r\n  That tells of winter's tales and mirth,\r\n  That milk-maids make about the hearth,\r\n  Of Christmas sports, the Wassail bowl,\r\n  That's tossed up after Fox-i'-th'-hole;\r\n  Of Blind-man's-buff, and of the care\r\n  That young men have to shoe the Mare;\r\n  Of Twelfth-tide cake, of peas and beans,\r\n  Wherewith ye make those merry scenes,\r\n  When as ye choose your king and queen,\r\n  And cry out, 'Hey for our town green.'\r\n  Of ash-heaps in the which ye use\r\n  Husbands and wives by streaks to choose:\r\n  Of crackling laurel, which fore-sounds\r\n  A plenteous harvest to your grounds;\r\n  Of these, and such like things, for shift,\r\n  We send instead of New-year's gift.\r\n  Read then, and when your faces shine\r\n  With bucksome meat and cap'ring wine,\r\n  Remember us in cups full crowned,\r\n  And let our city's health go round,\r\n  Quite through the young maids and the men,\r\n  To the ninth number, if not ten,\r\n  Until the fired chestnuts leap\r\n  For joy to see the fruits ye reap,\r\n  From the plump chalice and the cup\r\n  That tempts till it be tossed up.\r\n  Then as ye sit about your embers,\r\n  Call not to mind those fled Decembers;\r\n  But think on these, that are t' appear,\r\n  As daughters to the instant year;\r\n  Sit crowned with rose-buds and carouse,\r\n  Till _Liber Pater_ twirls the house\r\n  About your ears, and lay upon\r\n  The year, your cares, that's fled and gone.\r\n  And let the russet swains the plough\r\n  And harrow hang up resting now;\r\n  And to the bagpipe all address\r\n  Till sleep takes place of weariness.\r\n  And thus, throughout, with Christmas plays,\r\n  Frolic the full twelve holy-days.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR ISAAC NEWTON'S BIRTH, ON CHRISTMAS DAY,\r\n\r\nat Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, was the most important Christmas event\r\nof the memorable year which saw the outbreak of the Civil War (1642).\r\nIn the year of the Restoration he entered Cambridge, where the\r\nteaching of Isaac Barrow quickened his genius for mathematics, and\r\nfrom the time he left College his life became a series of wonderful\r\nphysical discoveries. As early as 1666, he discovered the law of\r\ngravitation, but it was not till the eve of the Revolution that his\r\n\"Principia\" revealed to the world his new theory of the universe.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CUSTOMS OF CHRISTMASTIDE IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\"A Christmas Carol,\" by George Wither, a well-known poet of this\r\nperiod, contains many allusions to the customs of Christmastide:--\r\n\r\n  So, now is come our joyful'st feast;\r\n    Let every man be jolly;\r\n  Each room with ivy leaves is drest,\r\n    And every post with holly.\r\n  Though some churls at our mirth repine,\r\n  Round your foreheads garlands twine;\r\n  Drown sorrow in a cup of wine,\r\n    And let us all be merry.\r\n\r\n  Now all our neighbours' chimneys smoke,\r\n    And Christmas blocks are burning;\r\n  Their ovens they with baked meats choke,\r\n    And all their spits are turning.\r\n  Without the door let sorrow lie;\r\n  And if for cold it hap to die,\r\n  We'll bury 't in a Christmas pie,\r\n    And ever more be merry.\r\n\r\n  Now every lad is wondrous trim,\r\n    And no man minds his labour;\r\n  Our lasses have provided them\r\n    A bag-pipe and a tabour;\r\n  Young men and maids, and girls and boys,\r\n  Give life to one another's joys;\r\n  And you anon shall by their noise\r\n    Perceive that they are merry.\r\n\r\n  Rank misers now do sparing shun;\r\n    Their hall of music soundeth;\r\n  And dogs thence with whole shoulders run,\r\n    So all things there aboundeth.\r\n  The country folks themselves advance\r\n  With crowdy-muttons[73] out of France;\r\n  And Jack shall pipe, and Jill shall dance,\r\n    And all the town be merry.\r\n\r\n  Ned Squash hath fetched his bands from pawn,\r\n    And all his best apparel;\r\n  Brisk Nell hath bought a ruff of lawn\r\n    With droppings of the barrel;\r\n  And those that hardly all the year\r\n  Had bread to eat, or rags to wear,\r\n  Will have both clothes and dainty fare,\r\n    And all the day be merry.\r\n\r\n  Now poor men to the justices\r\n    With capons make their errants;\r\n  And if they hap to fail of these;\r\n    They plague them with their warrants;\r\n  But now they feed them with good cheer.\r\n  And what they want they take in beer;\r\n  For Christmas comes but once a year,\r\n    And then they shall be merry.\r\n\r\n  Good farmers in the country nurse\r\n    The poor that else were undone;\r\n  Some landlords spend their money worse,\r\n    On lust and pride at London.\r\n  There the roys'ters they do play,\r\n  Drab and dice their lands away,\r\n  Which may be ours another day;\r\n    And therefore let's be merry.\r\n\r\n  The client now his suit forbears,\r\n    The prisoner's heart is eased:\r\n  The debtor drinks away his cares,\r\n    And for the time is pleased.\r\n  Though other purses be more fat,\r\n  Why should we pine or grieve at that?\r\n  Hang sorrow! care will kill a cat,\r\n    And therefore let's be merry.\r\n\r\n  Hark! how the wags abroad do call\r\n    Each other forth to rambling:\r\n  Anon you'll see them in the hall\r\n    For nuts and apples scrambling.\r\n  Hark! how the roofs with laughter sound!\r\n  Anon they'll think the house goes round,\r\n  For they the cellar's depth have found,\r\n    And there they will be merry.\r\n\r\n  The wenches with their wassail bowls\r\n    About the streets are singing;\r\n  The boys are come to catch the owls,\r\n    The wild mare in is bringing.\r\n  Our kitchen-boy hath broke his box,[74]\r\n  And to the dealing of the ox\r\n  Our honest neighbours come by flocks,\r\n    And here they will be merry.\r\n\r\n  Now kings and queens poor sheep cotes have,\r\n    And mate with everybody;\r\n  The honest now may play the knave,\r\n    And wise men play the noddy.\r\n  Some youths will now a mumming go,\r\n  Some others play at Rowland-ho\r\n  And twenty other gambols mo,\r\n    Because they will be merry.\r\n\r\n  Then wherefore in these merry days\r\n    Should we, I pray, be duller?\r\n  No, let us sing some roundelays,\r\n    To make our mirth the fuller.\r\n  And, whilst thus inspired we sing,\r\n  Let all the streets with echoes ring,\r\n  Woods and hills, and everything,\r\n    Bear witness we are merry.\r\n\r\nThe preceding poem was evidently written by Wither before the Civil\r\nWar troubles of the reign of Charles the First had interfered to damp\r\nthe national hilarity, or check the rejoicings at the festive season\r\nof Christmas.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEFEAT OF THE ROYALISTS,\r\n\r\nthe overthrow of the monarchy, and the changes resulting therefrom at\r\nChristmastide are alluded to in \"The Complaint of Christmas, written\r\nafter Twelftide, and printed before Candlemas, 1646,\" by old John\r\nTaylor, the Water Poet, who says: \"All the liberty and harmless\r\nsports, the merry gambols, dances and friscols, with which the toiling\r\nploughman and labourer once a year were wont to be recreated, and\r\ntheir spirits and hopes revived for a whole twelvemonth, are now\r\nextinct and put out of use, in such a fashion as if they never had\r\nbeen. Thus are the merry lords of bad rule at Westminster; nay, more,\r\ntheir madness hath extended itself to the very vegetables; senseless\r\ntrees, herbs, and weeds, are in a profane estimation amongst\r\nthem--holly, ivy, mistletoe, rosemary, bays, are accounted ungodly\r\nbranches of superstition for your entertainment. And to roast a\r\nsirloin of beef, to touch a collar of brawn, to take a pie, to put a\r\nplum in the pottage pot, to burn a great candle, or to lay one block\r\nthe more in the fire for your sake, Master Christmas, is enough to\r\nmake a man to be suspected and taken for a Christian, for which he\r\nshall be apprehended for committing high Parliament Treason and mighty\r\nmalignancy against the general Council of the Directorian private\r\nPresbyterian Conventicle.\"\r\n\r\nWith the success of the Parliamentarians, certain changes came in the\r\nruling manners of the age; but\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ATTEMPT TO ABOLISH CHRISTMAS DAY\r\n\r\nwas, of course, a signal failure. The event commemorated made it\r\nimpossible for the commemoration to cease. Men may differ as to the\r\nmode of celebration, but the Christ must and will be celebrated.\r\n\r\n\"In 1642,\" says Sandys, \"the first ordinances were issued to suppress\r\nthe performance of plays, and hesitation was expressed as to the\r\nmanner of keeping Christmas. Some shops in London were even opened on\r\nChristmas Day, 1643, part of the people being fearful of a Popish\r\nobservance of the day. The Puritans gradually prevailed, and in 1647\r\nsome parish officers were committed for permitting ministers to preach\r\nupon Christmas Day, and for adorning the church. On the 3rd of June in\r\nthe same year, it was ordained by the Lords and Commons in Parliament\r\nthat the feast of the Nativity of Christ, with other holidays, should\r\nbe no longer observed, and that all scholars, apprentices, and other\r\nservants, with the leave and approbation of their masters, should have\r\nsuch relaxation from labour on the second Tuesday in every month as\r\nthey used to have from such festivals and holy days; and in\r\nCanterbury, on the 22nd of December following, the crier went round by\r\ndirection of the Mayor, and proclaimed that Christmas Day and all\r\nother superstitious festivals should be put down, and a market kept\r\nupon that day.\"\r\n\r\nIn describing \"The First Christmas under the Puritan Directory,\" the\r\n_Saturday Review_ (December 27, 1884) says:--\"It must have been taken\r\nas a piece of good luck by the Parliamentary and Puritanical masters\r\nof England, or, as they would have said, as 'a providence,' that the\r\nChristmas Day of 1645 fell upon a week-day. It was the first Christmas\r\nDay after the legislative abolition of the Anglican Prayer-book and\r\nthe establishment of 'the Directory' in its stead; and, if it had\r\nfallen upon a Sunday, the Churches must have been opened. A 'Sabbath'\r\ncould not be ignored, even though it chanced to be the 25th of\r\nDecember. There can be small doubt that, if the Presbyterian and\r\nIndependent preachers who held all the English parishes subject to the\r\nParliament had been obliged to go into the pulpits on the 25th of\r\nDecember 1645, they would again have irritated the masses of the\r\npeople by ferociously 'improving the occasion.' The Parliament had not\r\nthe courage to repeat the brutal experiment of the previous year. It\r\nwas easy to abolish the feast by an ordinance; but it was risky to\r\ninsist by an ordinance that the English people and English families\r\nshould keep the dearest and most sacred of their festivals as a fast.\r\nThe rulers knew that such an ordinance would not be obeyed. They\r\nresolved simply to ignore the day, or treat it as any ordinary\r\nThursday. Doubtless many of the members kept up some sort of\r\ncelebration of the old family festival in their own private houses.\r\nBut the legislators marched solemnly to the Lower House, and the\r\n'divines' marched as solemnly to the Assembly in the Jerusalem\r\nChamber, affecting to take no notice of the unusual aspect of the\r\nshops and streets, which everywhere bore witness to the fact that\r\nthere was a deep and fundamental estrangement between 'the State' and\r\n'the people,' and that the people were actually keeping the festival\r\nwhich the 'Synod' had declared to be profane and superstitious, and\r\nwhich the Parliament to please the Scots, the Nonconformists, and the\r\nSectaries, had abolished by law. 'Notwithstanding the Ordinance,'\r\nwrote a Member of the House of Commons, the Erastian Whitelock, in his\r\n'Memorials,' 'yet generally this day, in London, the shops were shut\r\nand the day observed.' The Christmas number of the _Mercurius\r\nAcademicus_ (December 25 to 31, 1645), states that General Browne, who\r\nwas a Presbyterian zealot, 'proclaimed' the abolition of Christmas\r\nDay at Abingdon, and 'sent out his warrants for men to work on\r\nthat day especially.' ... The Parliamentary newspaper, _The Weekly\r\nAccount_, (LIII. week, 1645), has the bald record: 'Thursday, Decemb.\r\n25. The Commons sate in a Grand Committee concerning the privileges of\r\nmembers of their House.' The news in the Tuesday paper, _The\r\nKingdome's Weekly Intelligencer_ (No. 152), is equally thin:\r\n'Thursday, Decemb. 25, vulgarly known by the name of Christmas Day,\r\nboth Houses sate. The House of Commons more especially debated some\r\nthings in reference to the privileges of that House, and made some\r\norders therein.' ... The Presbyterian and Independent divines spent\r\nChristmas Day in the 'Synod' of Westminster. December the 25th, 1645,\r\nwas entered in their minutes as 'Session 561.' ... The City newspaper\r\nof that period, _Mercurius Civicus, or London's Intelligencer_, in\r\nwhat we may call its Christmas number (No. 135, December 18 to\r\nDecember 24, 1645), printed an article explaining to the citizens of\r\nLondon the absurdity, if not the impiety, of keeping Christmas Day.\r\nEvery good citizen was expected to open his shop as usual on the\r\ncoming Thursday, and compel his apprentices to keep behind the\r\ncounter. The City newspaper stated, that it was more probable that the\r\nSaviour was born in September than in December, and quotes 'a late\r\nreverend minister's opinion, that God did conceale the time when\r\nChrist was borne, upon the same reason that He tooke away the body of\r\nMoses, that they might not put an holinesse upon that day.' If the\r\napprentices want a holiday, 'let them keep the fift of November, and\r\nother dayes of that nature, or the late great mercy of God in the\r\ntaking of Hereford, which deserves an especiall day of thanksgiving.'\r\nThe mass of the English folk meanwhile protested by all such ways as\r\nwere open to them against the outlandish new religion which was being\r\ninvented for them. The _Mercuricus Civicus_ complained that, 'Many\r\npeople in these times are too much addicted to the superstitious\r\nobservance of this day, December 25th, and other saints days, as they\r\nare called.' It was asked in a 'Hue and Cry after Christmas,'\r\npublished anonymously at the end of the year 1645, 'Where may\r\nChristmas be found?' The answer is, 'In the corner of a translator's\r\nshop, where the cobbler was wont so merrily to chant his carols.' _The\r\nModerate Intelligencer_, which devoted itself to 'impartially\r\ncommunicating martiall affaires,' in its forty-third number (December\r\n25, 1645, to January 1, 1646), expressed itself as scandalized at the\r\nzeal with which the English people, in spite of Parliament and the\r\nAssembly, had kept their Christmas. Social phenomena lay beyond the\r\nusual ken of the military chroniclers; but 'we shall only observe,'\r\nthey wrote, 'the loathnesse of the People to part with it, which\r\ncertainly argues a greater adoration than should have been. Hardly\r\nforty shops were open within the lines upon that day. The State hath\r\ndone well to null it out of this respect, as Moses did the Brazen\r\nSerpent.' The Scriptural knowledge of the Puritan military newsmen was\r\ncuriously at fault; they evidently confounded Moses with Hezekiah,\r\nunless they substituted the lawgiver for the king, because they\r\nthought it unwise to represent the King as the foe of idolatry. The\r\ntraditional scorn of the Pharisee for the common people which know not\r\nthe law comes out in the ironical passage with which the 'martiall'\r\norgan concludes its reference to the distressing social symptom; 'Sure\r\nif there were an ordinance for recreation and labour upon the Lord's\r\nDay, or Sabbath (like the prelatical Book of Sports), these would want\r\nno observers. Unwillingness to obey, in a multitude, argues generally\r\nthe goodnesse of a law, readinesse the contrary, especially in those\r\nlaws which have anything of religion in them.' Hence the puritanical\r\ntyrants thought the observation of Christmas Day should be visited in\r\nfuture years with more severe penalties. A few days after Christmas a\r\npamphlet was issued under the title of 'The Arraignment, Conviction,\r\nand Imprisonment of Christmas.' A letter from a 'Malignant scholar' in\r\nOxford, where Christmas had been observed as usual, to 'a Malignant\r\nlady in London,' had contained the promise or threat, according to the\r\npamphleteer, that the King would shortly appear in London, and restore\r\nto his poor people their old social and religious liberties. 'We shall\r\nsoon be in London, and have all things as they were wont.' There was\r\nsmall chance, six months after Naseby, of the fulfilment of the\r\nprediction. The puritanical pamphleteer, however, owns that it would\r\nbe welcome to 'every 'prentice boy,' because the return of the King\r\nwould have meant the return of a free Christmas, which he sorely\r\nmissed. 'All popish, prelatical, Jesuitical, ignorant, Judaical, and\r\nsuperstitious persons,' said he, 'ask after the old, old, old, very\r\nold grey-bearded gentleman called Christmas, who was wont to be a very\r\nfamiliar ghest (_sic_). Whoever finds him again shall be rewarded with\r\na benediction from the Pope, a hundred oaths from the Cavaliers, forty\r\nkisses from the wanton wenches, and be made pursuivant to the next\r\nArchbishop.' 'The poor,' he added, 'are sorry for it. They go to every\r\ndoor a-begging, as they were wont to do, 'Good Mistress, somewhat\r\nagainst this good time.' Instead of going to the alehouse to be\r\ndrunke, they are fain to work all the holy dayes.' Again, 'The\r\nschollars come into the hall, where their hungry stomacks had thought\r\nto have found good brawne and Christmas pie, roast-beef and\r\nplum-porridge. But no such matter. Away, ye profane! These are\r\nsuperstitious meats; your stomacks must be fed with sound doctrine.'\"\r\n\r\nIn the _National Magazine_ (1857), Dr. Doran, on \"The Ups and Downs of\r\nChristmas,\" remarks upon the stout resistance given by the citizens of\r\nLondon to the order of the Puritan Parliament, that shops should be\r\nopened and churches closed on Christmas Day. \"We may have a sermon on\r\nany other day,\" said the London apprentices, who did not always go to\r\nhear it, \"why should we be deprived on this day?\" \"It is no longer\r\nlawful for the day to be kept,\" was the reply. \"Nay,\" exclaimed the\r\nsharp-witted fellows, \"you keep it yourselves by thus distinguishing\r\nit by desecration.\" \"They declared,\" says Dr. Doran, \"they would go to\r\nchurch; numerous preachers promised to be ready for them with prayer\r\nand lecture; and the porters of Cornhill swore they would dress up\r\ntheir conduit with holly, if it were only to prove that in that\r\northodox and heavily-enduring body there was some respect yet left for\r\nChristianity and hard drinking--for the raising of the holly was ever\r\naccompanied by the lifting of tankards.\r\n\r\n\"Nor was the gallant Christmas spirit less lively in the country than\r\nin the capital. At Oxford there was a world of skull-breaking; and at\r\nIpswich the festival was celebrated by some loss of life. Canterbury\r\nespecially distinguished itself by its violent opposition to the\r\nmunicipal order to be mirthless. There was a combat there, which was\r\nmost rudely maintained, and in which the mayor got pummelled until he\r\nwas as senseless as a pocket of hops. The mob mauled him terribly,\r\nbroke all his windows, as well as his bones, and, as we are told,\r\n'burnt the stoupes at the coming in of his door.' So serious was the\r\nriot, so complete the popular victory, and so jubilant the exultation,\r\nthat thousands of the never-conquered men of Kent and Kentish men met\r\nin Canterbury, and passed a solemn resolution that if they could not\r\nhave their Christmas Day, they were determined to have the King on his\r\nthrone again.\"\r\n\r\nOf the Canterbury riot an account is given in a rare tract, published\r\nin 1647 (preserved in the British Museum), and entitled--\r\n\r\n\"The Declaration of many thousands of the city of Canterbury, or\r\ncounty of Kent. Concerning the late tumult in the city of Canterbury,\r\nprovokt by the Mayor's violent proceedings against those who desired\r\nto continue the celebration of the Feast of Christ's Nativity, 1,500\r\nyears and upwards maintained in the Church. Together with their\r\nResolutions for the restitution of His Majestie to his Crown and\r\ndignity, whereby Religion may be restored to its ancient splendour,\r\nand the known Laws of this Kingdom maintained. As also their desires\r\nto all His Majesties loyall subjects within his Dominions, for their\r\nconcurrence and assistance in this so good and pious a work.\"\r\n\r\nThe resolutions of the Canterbury citizens were not couched in the\r\nchoicest terms, for the tract states that the two Houses of Parliament\r\n\"have sate above seven years to hatch Cocatrices and Vipers, they have\r\nfilled the kingdom with Serpents, bloodthirsty Souldiers, extorting\r\nCommittees, Sequestrators, Excisemen; all the Rogues and scumme of the\r\nkingdom have they set on work to torment and vex the people, to rob\r\nthem, and to eat the bread out of their mouthes; they have raised a\r\ncauselesse and unnaturall Warre against their own Soveraigne Lord and\r\nKing, a most pious Christian Prince, contrary to their allegiance and\r\nduty, and have shed innocent blood in this Land. Religion is onely\r\ntalkt of, nothing done; they have put down what is good,\" &c., &c. And\r\nfurther on the tract says:--\"The cause of this so sudden a posture of\r\ndefence which we have put our selves into was the violent proceedings\r\nof the Mayor of this city of Canterbury and his uncivill carriage in\r\npersuance of some petty order of the House of Commons for hindering\r\nthe celebration of Christ's Nativity so long continued in the Church\r\nof God. That which we so much desired that day was but a Sermon, which\r\nany other day of the weeke was tollerable by the orders and practise\r\nof the two Houses and all their adherents, but that day (because it\r\nwas Christ's birth day) we must have none; that which is good all the\r\nyeer long, yet is this day superstitious. The Mayor causing some of us\r\nto be beaten contrary to his oath and office, who ought to preserve\r\nthe peace, and to that purpose chiefly is the sword of justice put\r\ninto his hands, and wrongfully imprisoned divers of us, because we did\r\nassemble ourselves to hear the Word of God, which he was pleased to\r\ninterpret a Ryot; yet we were unarmed, behaved ourselves civilly,\r\nintended no such tumult as afterwards we were forc'd unto; but at\r\nlast, seeing the manifest wrong done to our children, servants, and\r\nneighbours, by beating, wounding, and imprisoning them, and to release\r\nthem that were imprisoned, and did call unto our assistance our\r\nbrethren of the county of Kent, who very readily came in to us, as\r\nhave associated themselves to us in this our just and lawfull defence,\r\nand do concurre with us in this our Remonstrance concerning the King\r\nMajestie, and the settlement of the peace in this Kingdome.\" And the\r\ntract afterwards expresses the desire that \"all his Majesties loyall\r\nsubjects within his Dominions\" will \"readily and cheerfully concurre\r\nand assist in this so good and pious a work.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the single sheets in the British Museum is an order of\r\nParliament, dated the 24th of December, 1652, directing,\r\n\r\n\"That no observation shall be had of the five and twentieth day of\r\nDecember, commonly called Christmas Day; nor any solemnity used or\r\nexercised in churches upon that day in respect thereof.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to the celebration of Christmas Day in 1657, Evelyn says:--\r\n\r\n\"I went to London with my wife to celebrate Christmas Day, Mr. Gunning\r\npreaching in Exeter Chapel, on Micah vii. 2. Sermon ended; as he was\r\ngiving us the Holy Sacrament the chapel was surrounded with soldiers,\r\nand all the communicants and assembly surprised and kept prisoners by\r\nthem, some in the house, others carried away. It fell to my share to\r\nbe confined to a room in the house, where yet I was permitted to dine\r\nwith the master of it, the Countess of Dorset, Lady Hatton, and some\r\nothers of quality who invited me. In the afternoon came Colonel\r\nWhalley, Goffe, and others from Whitehall to examine us one by one;\r\nsome they committed to the Marshal, some to prison. When I came before\r\nthem they took my name and abode, examined me why, contrary to the\r\nordinance made that none should any longer observe the superstitious\r\ntime of the Nativity (as esteemed by them), I durst offend, and\r\nparticularly be at Common Prayers, which they told me was but the mass\r\nin English, and particularly pray for Charles Stuart, for which we had\r\nno Scripture. I told them we did not pray for Charles Stuart, but for\r\nall Christian kings, princes, and governors. They replied, in so doing\r\nwe prayed for the King of Spain too, who was their enemy and a Papist;\r\nwith other frivolous and ensnaring questions and much threatening,\r\nand, finding no colour to detain me, they dismissed me with much pity\r\nof my ignorance. These were men of high flight and above ordinances,\r\nand spake spiteful things of our Lord's Nativity. As we went up to\r\nreceive the sacrament the miscreants held their muskets against us, as\r\nif they would have shot us at the altar, but yet suffering us to\r\nfinish the office of communion, as perhaps not having instructions\r\nwhat to do in case they found us in that action; so I got home late\r\nthe next day, blessed be God!\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the adverse acts of the Puritans, however, and the\r\nsuppression of Christmas observances in high places, the old customs\r\nand festivities were still observed in different parts of the country,\r\nthough with less ostentation than formerly; and various publications\r\nappeared which plainly showed that the popular sentiments were in\r\nfavour of the festivities. The motto of No. 37 of _Mercurius\r\nDemocritus_, from December 22, 1652, begins:\r\n\r\n \"Old Christmas now is come to town\r\n    Though few do him regard,\r\n  He laughs to see them going down\r\n    That have put down his Lord.\"\r\n\r\nIn \"The Vindication of Father Christmas,\" 1653, a mock complaint in\r\nthe character of Father Christmas, he laments the treatment he had\r\nreceived for the last twelve years, and that he was even then but\r\ncoolly received. \"But welcome, or not welcome, I am come,\" he says,\r\nand then states that his \"best and freest welcome was with some kinde\r\nof country farmers in Devonshire,\" thus describing his entertainment\r\namong them:--\"After dinner we arose from the boord, and sate by the\r\nfire, where the harth was imbrodered all over with roasted apples,\r\npiping hot, expecting a bole of ale for a cooler, which immediately\r\nwas transformed into warm lamb wool. After which we discoursed merily,\r\nwithout either prophaneness or obscenity; some went to cards; others\r\nsung carols and pleasant songs (suitable to the times), and then the\r\npoor laboring Hinds, and maid-servants, with the plow-boys, went\r\nnimbly to dancing; the poor toyling wretches being glad of my\r\ncompany, because they had little or no sport at all till I came\r\namongst them; and therefore they skipped and leaped for joy, singing a\r\ncarol to the tune of hey,\r\n\r\n \"Let's dance and sing, and make good chear,\r\n    For Christmas comes but once a year:\r\n  Draw hogsheads dry, let flagons fly,\r\n    For now the bells shall ring;\r\n  Whilst we endeavour to make good\r\n    The title 'gainst a King.\r\n\r\n\"Thus at active games, and gambols of hot cockles, shooing the wild\r\nmare, and the like harmless sports, some part of the tedious night was\r\nspent.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL TROUBLES\r\n\r\nwere not brought to an end by the execution of Charles I. on the 30th\r\nof January, 1649. In addition to the rioting caused by the attempt to\r\nabolish the festival of Christmas by law, the Lord Protector (Oliver\r\nCromwell) had to struggle against discontented republicans and also\r\nagainst fresh outbreaks of the Royalists; and, although able to carry\r\non the Protectorate to the end of his own life, Cromwell was unable to\r\nsecure a strong successor. He died on September 3, 1658, having on his\r\ndeathbed nominated his son Richard to succeed him. Richard Cromwell\r\nwas accepted in England and by the European Powers, and carried\r\nhimself discreetly in his new position. A Parliament was assembled on\r\nJanuary 17, 1659, which recognised the new Protector, but the\r\nrepublican minority, headed by Vane and Haselrig, united with the\r\nofficers of the army, headed by Lambert, Fleetwood, and Desborough, to\r\nforce him to dissolve Parliament (April 22, 1659). The Protector's\r\nsupporters urged him to meet force by force, but he replied, \"I will\r\nnot have a drop of blood spilt for the preservation of my greatness,\r\nwhich is a burden to me.\" He signed a formal abdication (May, 1659),\r\nin return for which the restored Rump undertook the discharge of his\r\ndebts. After the Restoration Richard Cromwell fled to the Continent,\r\nwhere he remained for many years, returning to England in 1680. A\r\nportion of his property was afterwards restored to him. He died at\r\nCheshunt, Hertfordshire, in 1712.\r\n\r\nOn Richard Cromwell declining to uphold the Protectorate by force of\r\narms, the only hope of establishing a settled form of government and\r\nof saving the country from a military despotism seemed to be in the\r\nrestoration of the monarchy; therefore, chiefly through the\r\ninstrumentality of General Monk, Charles, the son of Charles I. and\r\nHenrietta Maria, was invited to return to England. He at once\r\nresponded, and entered London in triumph as Charles II., on May 29,\r\n1660, having previously signed the declaration of Breda. By this\r\ndeclaration the King granted a free and general pardon to all \"who\r\nwithin forty days after the publishing hereof shall lay hold upon this\r\nour grace and favour, and shall by any public act declare their doing\r\nso,\" except such as the Parliament of both houses should except.\r\n\r\n    [69] \"Works of Ben Jonson.\"\r\n\r\n    [70] \"Fantasticks,\" 1626.\r\n\r\n    [71] \"History of the English People.\"\r\n\r\n    [72] \"Year Book.\"\r\n\r\n    [73] Fiddlers.\r\n\r\n    [74] An allusion to the Christmas money-box, made of\r\n    earthenware which required to be broken to obtain\r\n    possession of the money it held.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS FROM THE RESTORATION TO\r\nTHE DEATH OF GEORGE II.\r\n\r\n(1660-1760.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RESTORATION OF THE MONARCHY\r\n\r\nunder Charles II., sometimes styled the \"Merry Monarch,\" was an\r\noccasion of great rejoicing, and the spirit in which the\r\nso-long-fugitive Prince, who once eluded his pursuers by hiding in an\r\noak, was now welcomed as \"Charles our King\" by \"the roaring, ranting\"\r\nportion of the populace is set forth in the following ballad, written\r\nfor the first Christmas after the Restoration, printed in London, the\r\nsame year, and now copied from a collection of illustrated broadsides\r\npreserved in the Library of the British Museum:--\r\n\r\n\r\nMERRY BOYS OF CHRISTMAS,\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nThe Milk-maid's New Year's Gift.\r\n\r\n  When Lads and Lasses take delight,\r\n    together for to be;\r\n  They pass away the Winter night,\r\n    and live most merrily.\r\n\r\n    To the tune of, _Hey boys up go we_.\r\n\r\n  Come, come my roaring ranting boys\r\n    lets never be cast down,\r\n  We'l never mind the female toys,\r\n    but Loyal be to th' Crown:\r\n  We'l never break our hearts with care,\r\n    nor be cast down with fear,\r\n  Our bellys then let us prepare\r\n    to drink some Christmas Beer.\r\n\r\n  Then here's a health to Charles our King,\r\n    throughout the world admir'd,\r\n  Let us his great applauses sing,\r\n    that we so much desir'd,\r\n  And wisht amongst us for to reign,\r\n    when Oliver rul'd here,\r\n  But since he's home return'd again,\r\n    come fill some Christmas Beer.\r\n\r\n  These holidays we'l briskly drink,\r\n    all mirth we will devise,\r\n  No Treason we will speak or think,\r\n    then bring us brave minc'd pies\r\n  Roast Beef and brave Plum porridge,\r\n    our Loyal hearts to chear,\r\n  Then prithee make no more ado,\r\n    but bring us Christmas Beer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE HACKIN\"]\r\n\r\n[In these Times all the Spits were sparkling the _Hackin_ must be boiled\r\nby Daybreak or else two young Men took the Maiden by the Arms and run\r\nher round the Market Place till she was ashamed of her laziness.--_Round\r\nabout our Coal Fire or Christmas Entertainments_ published in 1740.]\r\n\r\nMany of the popular songs of this period complain of the decline of\r\nthe Christmas celebrations during the time of the Commonwealth, and\r\nsome of them contrast the present with former celebrations. In a\r\nballad called \"The Old and Young Courtier,\" printed in 1670, comparing\r\nthe times of Queen Elizabeth with those of her successors, the fifth\r\nand twelfth verses contain the following parallel respecting\r\nChristmas--\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n \"With a good old fashion, when Christmasse was come,\r\n  To call in all his old neighbours with bagpipe and drum,\r\n  With good chear enough to furnish every old room,\r\n  And old liquor, able to make a cat speak, and man dumb\r\n          Like an old Courtier of the Queen's,\r\n          And the Queen's old Courtier\"\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n \"With a new fashion, when Christmas is drawing on,\r\n  On a new journey to London straight we all must begone,\r\n  And leave none to keep house, but our new porter John,\r\n  Who relieves the poor with a thump on the back with a stone,\r\n          Like a young courtier of the King's,\r\n          And the King's young courtier\"\r\n\r\n(_Percy's Reliques_)\r\n\r\nAnother called \"Time's Alteration, or, the Old Man's Rehearsal, what\r\nbrave dayes he knew a great while agone, when his old cap was new,\"\r\nsays--\r\n\r\n \"A man might then behold,\r\n    At Christmas, in each hall,\r\n  Good fires to curb the cold\r\n    And meat for great and small;\r\n  The neighbours were friendly bidden,\r\n    And all had welcome true,\r\n  The poor from the gates were not chidden,\r\n    When this old cap was new\r\n\r\n  Black jacks to every man\r\n    Were filled with wine and beer,\r\n  No pewter pot nor can\r\n    In those days did appear\r\n  Good cheer in a nobleman's house\r\n    Was counted a seemly shew,\r\n  We wanted no brawn nor souse,\r\n     When this old cap was new.\"\r\n\r\n(_Evans's Ballads_)\r\n\r\nReferring to the Restoration of the monarchy, and contrasting it with\r\nthe Protectorate period, _Poor Robin's Almanack_, 1685, says--\r\n\r\n \"Now thanks to God for Charles' return,\r\n  Whose absence made old Christmas mourn,\r\n  For then we scarcely did it know,\r\n  Whether it Christmas were or no\r\n\r\n*    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\n  To feast the poor was counted sin,\r\n  When treason that great praise did win\r\n  May we ne'er see the like again,\r\n  The roguish Rump should o'er us reign.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the Restoration an effort was made to revive the Christmas\r\nentertainments of the Court at Whitehall, but they do not appear to\r\nhave recovered their former splendour. The habits of Charles the\r\nSecond were of too sensual a nature to induce him to interest himself\r\nin such pursuits; besides which the manners of the country had been\r\nchanged during the sway of the Puritans. Pepys states that Charles II.\r\nvisited Lincoln's Inn to see the Christmas revels of 1661, \"there\r\nbeing, according to an old custom, a Prince and all his nobles, and\r\nother matters of sport and charge.\" And the diary of the Rev. John\r\nWard, vicar of Stratford-upon-Avon, extending from 1648 to 1679,\r\nstates: \"The Duke of Norfolk expended L20,000 in keeping Christmas.\r\nCharles II. gave over keeping that festival on this account; his\r\nmunificence gave great offence at Court.\" Sandys mentions that a\r\npastoral called _Calisto_, written by Crowne, was acted by the\r\ndaughters of the Duke of York and the young nobility. About the same\r\ntime the Lady Anne, afterwards Queen, acted the part of Semandra in\r\nLee's \"Mithridates.\" Betterton and his wife instructed the performers,\r\nin remembrance of which, when Anne came to the throne, she gave the\r\nlatter a pension of L100 a year.\r\n\r\nThe Inns of Court also had their Christmas feasts; but the conduct of\r\nthem was evidently not so much coveted as in former times, for there\r\nis an entry in the records of Gray's Inn on November 3, 1682, \"That\r\nMr. Richard Gipps, on his promise to perform the office of Master of\r\nthe Revels, this and the next Term, be called to the Bar of Grace,\"\r\n_i.e._, without payment of the usual fees: thus holding out a reward\r\nfor his services, instead of allowing him, as in former times, to\r\nspend a large portion of his private fortune unrequited, except by the\r\nhonour of the temporary office.\r\n\r\nAmong the principal of the royal amusements in the time of Charles the\r\nSecond were horse-racing and theatrical performances. The King kept an\r\nestablishment at Newmarket, where, according to Strutt, \"he entered\r\nhorses and ran them in his name.\" And the author of some doggerel\r\nverses, referring to Burford Downs, says:--\r\n\r\n \"Next for the glory of the place,\r\n  Here has been rode many a race,--\r\n  King Charles the Second I saw here;\r\n  But I've forgotten in what year.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS AT SEA IN 1675.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Henry Teonge, chaplain of an English ship of war, gives in\r\nhis diary a description of the manner in which the Christmas was spent\r\non board, in 1675:--\"Dec. 25, 1675.--Crismas day wee keepe thus. At 4\r\nin the morning our trumpeters all doe flatt their trumpetts, and begin\r\nat our Captain's cabin, and thence to all the officers' and\r\ngentlemen's cabins; playing a levite at each cabine door, and bidding\r\ngood morrow, wishing a merry Crismas. After they goe to their station,\r\nviz., on the poope, and sound 3 levitts in honour of the morning. At\r\n10 wee goe to prayers and sermon; text, Zacc. ix. 9. Our Captaine had\r\nall his officers and gentlemen to dinner with him, where wee had\r\nexcellent good fayre: a ribb of beife, plumb-puddings, minct pyes, &c.\r\nand plenty of good wines of severall sorts; dranke healths to the\r\nKing, to our wives and friends, and ended the day with much civill\r\nmyrth.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS-KEEPING IN THE COUNTRY,\r\n\r\nat this period, is referred to by different writers.\r\n\r\nAmong the Garrick Plays in the British Museum is \"_The Christmas\r\nOrdinary, a Private Show_; wherein is expressed the jovial Freedom of\r\nthat Festival: as it was acted at a Gentleman's House among other\r\nRevels. By W. R., Master of Arts, 4 to. London, 1682.\"\r\n\r\nThe Memoirs of the hospitable Sir John Reresby (Camden Society)\r\ncontain references to the Christmas festivities at Thrybergh. In 1682,\r\nthere assembled on Christmas Eve nineteen of the poorer tenants from\r\nDenby and Hooton; on Christmas Day twenty-six of the poorer tenants\r\nfrom Thrybergh, Brinsford, and Mexborough; on St. Stephen's Day\r\nfarmers and better sort of tenants to the number of fifty-four; on St.\r\nJohn's-day forty five of the chief tenants; on the 30th of December\r\neighteen gentlemen of the neighbourhood with their wives; on the 1st\r\nof January sixteen gentlemen; on the 4th twelve of the neighbouring\r\nclergymen; and on the 6th seven gentlemen and tradesmen. Among the\r\nguests who lodged at the house were \"Mr. Rigden, merchant of York, and\r\nhis wife, a handsome woman,\" and \"Mr. Belton, an ingenious clergyman,\r\nbut too much a good fellow.\" How the \"ingenious clergyman\" became \"too\r\nmuch of a good fellow\" may be easily guessed from Sir John's further\r\nobservation that \"_the expense of liquor_, _both of wine & others, was\r\nconsiderable_, as of other provisions, and my friends appeared well\r\nsatisfied.\" In 1684, writes Sir John, \"I returned to Thrybergh, by\r\nGod's mercy, in safety, to keep Christmas amongst my neighbours and\r\ntenants. I had more company this Christmas than heretofore. The four\r\nfirst days of the new year all my tenants of Thrybergh, Brinsford,\r\nDenby, Mexborough, Hooton Roberts, and Rotterham dined with me; the\r\nrest of the time some four-score of gentlemen and yeomen with their\r\nwives were invited, besides some that came from York; so that all the\r\nbeds in the house and most in the town were taken up. There were\r\nseldom less than four-score, counting all sorts of people, that dined\r\nin the house every day, and some days many more. On New Year's-day\r\nchiefly there dined above three hundred, so that whole sheep were\r\nroasted and served up to feed them. For music I had four violins,\r\nbesides bagpipes, drums, and trumpets.\"\r\n\r\nAt Houghton Chapel, Nottinghamshire, says an old writer, \"the good Sir\r\nWilliam Hollis kept his house in great splendour and hospitality. He\r\nbegan Christmas at All Hallowtide, and continued it till Candlemas,\r\nduring which time any man was permitted to stay three days without\r\nbeing asked who he was, or from whence he came.\" This generous knight\r\nhad many guests who rejoiced in the couplet:--\r\n\r\n  \"If I ask'not my guest whence and whither his way,\r\n  'Tis because I would have him here with me to stay.\"\r\n\r\nIt is no part of our purpose to enter into details of the events which\r\nled up to the Revolution. Suffice it to say, that during the reign of\r\nCharles II. began the great struggle between the King and the people,\r\nbut Charles steadily refused to alter the succession by excluding his\r\nbrother James. He died on the 6th of February, 1685, and\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES II. CAME TO THE THRONE\r\n\r\nin the midst of an unsettled state of affairs. James made a bold, but\r\nunsuccessful, attempt to restore the power of Romanism in England,\r\nand, ultimately, consulted his own safety by fleeing to France,\r\nlanding at Ambleteuse, in Brittany, on Christmas Day, 1688,\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTMAS OF THE REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\nThe flight of James put an end to the struggle between Crown and\r\npeople, and the offering of the Crown, with constitutional\r\nlimitations, to William, Prince of Orange, and his wife Mary, daughter\r\nof King James II. and granddaughter of King Charles I. of England,\r\nspeedily followed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM AND MARY\r\n\r\naccepted the invitation of the English people, and began their reign\r\non February 13, 1689. They both took an interest in the sports and\r\npastimes of the people. Strutt says William patronised horse-racing,\r\n\"and established an academy for riding; and his queen not only\r\ncontinued the bounty of her predecessors, but added several plates to\r\nthe former donations.\" The death of Queen Mary, from small-pox, on the\r\n28th of December, 1694, cast a gloom over the Christmas festivities,\r\nand left King William almost heart-broken at her loss. As to\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTMAS FESTIVITIES\r\n\r\nBrand says that in \"Batt upon Batt,\" a Poem by a Person of Quality\r\n(1694), speaking of Batt's carving knives and other implements, the\r\nauthor asks:--\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Without their help, who can good Christmas keep?\r\n  Our teeth would chatter and our eyes would weep;\r\n  Hunger and dullness would invade our feasts,\r\n  Did not Batt find us arms against such guests.\r\n  He is the cunning engineer, whose skill\r\n  Makes fools to carve the goose, and shape the quill:\r\n  Fancy and wit unto our meals supplies:\r\n  Carols, and not minc'd-meat, make Christmas pies.\r\n  'Tis mirth, not dishes, sets a table off;\r\n  Brutes and Phanaticks eat, and never laugh.\r\n\r\n  *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n  When _brawn, with powdred wig_, comes swaggering in,\r\n  And mighty serjeant ushers in the Chine,\r\n  What ought a wise man first to think upon?\r\n  Have I my Tools? if not, I am undone:\r\n  For 'tis a law concerns both saint and sinner,\r\n  He that hath no knife must have no dinner.\r\n  So he falls on; pig, goose, and capon, feel\r\n  The goodness of his stomach and Batt's steel.\r\n  In such fierce frays, alas! there no remorse is;\r\n  All flesh is grass, which makes men feed like horses:\r\n  But when the battle's done, _off goes the hat_,\r\n  And each man sheaths, with God-a-mercy Batt.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Batt upon Batt\" also gives the following account of the Christmas\r\nGambols in 1694:--\r\n\r\n \"O mortal man! is eating all you do\r\n  At Christ-Tide? or the making Sing-songs? No:\r\n  Our Batt can _dance_, play at _high Jinks with Dice_,\r\n  At any primitive, orthodoxal Vice.\r\n  _Shooing the wild Mare, tumbling the young Wenches,\r\n  Drinking all Night_, and sleeping on the Benches.\r\n  Shew me a man can _shuffle fair and cut_,\r\n  Yet always _have three Trays in hand at Putt_:\r\n  Shew me a man can _turn up Noddy_ still,\r\n  And _deal himself three Fives too_ when he will:\r\n  Conclude with _one and thirty, and a Pair_,\r\n  Never fail _Ten in stock_, and yet play fair,\r\n  If Batt be not that Wight, I lose my aim.\"\r\n\r\nAnother enumeration of the festive sports of this season occurs (says\r\nBrand) in a poem entitled Christmas--\r\n\r\n              \"Young Men and Maidens, now\r\n  At _Feed the Dove_ (with laurel leaf in mouth)\r\n  Or _Blindman's Buff_, or _Hunt the Slipper_ play,\r\n  Replete with glee. Some, haply, _Cards_ adopt;\r\n  Of it to _Forfeits_ they the Sport confine,\r\n  The happy Folk, adjacent to the fire,\r\n  Their Stations take; excepting one alone.\r\n  (Sometimes the social Mistress of the house)\r\n  Who sits within the centre of the room,\r\n  To cry the pawns; much is the laughter, now,\r\n  Of such as can't the Christmas Catch repeat,\r\n  And who, perchance, are sentenc'd to salute\r\n  The jetty beauties of the chimney black,\r\n  Or Lady's shoe: others, more lucky far,\r\n  By hap or favour, meet a sweeter doom,\r\n  And on each fair-one's lovely lips imprint\r\n  The ardent kiss.\"\r\n\r\n_Poor Robin's Almanack_ (1695) thus rejoices at the return of the\r\nfestival:--\r\n\r\n \"Now thrice welcome, Christmas,\r\n    Which brings us good cheer,\r\n  Minc'd-pies and plumb-porridge,\r\n    Good ale and strong beer;\r\n  With pig, goose, and capon,\r\n    The best that may be,\r\n  So well doth the weather\r\n    And our stomachs agree.\r\n\r\n  Observe how the chimneys\r\n    Do smoak all about,\r\n  The cooks are providing\r\n    For dinner, no doubt;\r\n  But those on whose tables\r\n    No victuals appear,\r\n  O may they keep Lent\r\n    All the rest of the year!\r\n\r\n  With holly and ivy\r\n    So green and so gay;\r\n  We deck up our houses\r\n    As fresh as the day,\r\n  With bays and rosemary,\r\n    And laurel compleat,\r\n  And every one now\r\n    Is a king in conceit.\r\n\r\n  *     *     *    *    *\r\n\r\n  But as for curmudgeons,\r\n    Who will not be free,\r\n  I wish they may die\r\n    On the three-legged tree.\"\r\n\r\nAt Christmastide, 1696, an Act of Attainder was passed against Sir\r\nJohn Fenwick, one of the most ardent of the Jacobite conspirators who\r\ntook part in the plot to assassinate the King. He was executed on\r\nTower Hill, January 28, 1697. This was the last instance in English\r\nhistory in which a person was attainted by Act of Parliament, and\r\nHallam's opinion of this Act of Attainder is that \"it did not, like\r\nsome acts of attainder, inflict a punishment beyond the offence, but\r\nsupplied the deficiency of legal evidence.\"\r\n\r\nPeter the Great, of Russia, kept the Christmas of 1697 in England,\r\nresiding at Sayes Court, a house of the celebrated John Evelyn, close\r\nto Deptford Dockyard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS, 1701.\r\n\r\n[From _Poor Robin's Almanack_.]\r\n\r\n  Now enter Christmas like a man,\r\n  Armed with spit and dripping-pan,\r\n  Attended with pasty, plum-pie,\r\n  Puddings, plum-porridge, furmity;\r\n  With beef, pork, mutton of each sort\r\n  More than my pen can make report;\r\n  Pig, swan, goose, rabbits, partridge, teal,\r\n  With legs and loins and breasts of veal:\r\n  But above all the minced pies\r\n  Must mention'd be in any wise,\r\n  Or else my Muse were much to blame,\r\n  Since they from Christmas take their name.\r\n  With these, or any one of these,\r\n  A man may dine well if he please;\r\n  Yet this must well be understood,--\r\n  Though one of these be singly good,\r\n  Yet more the merrier is the best\r\n  As well of dishes as of guest.\r\n    But the times are grown so bad\r\n  Scarce one dish for the poor is had;\r\n  Good housekeeping is laid aside,\r\n  And all is spent to maintain pride;\r\n  Good works are counted popish, and\r\n  Small charity is in the land.\r\n  A man may sooner (truth I tell ye)\r\n  Break his own neck than fill his belly.\r\n  Good God amend what is amiss\r\n  And send a remedy to this,\r\n  That Christmas day again may rise\r\n  And we enjoy our Christmas pies.\r\n\r\nThe Christmas customs of this period are thus referred to by the\r\n\"Bellman, on Christmas Eve\":--\r\n\r\n \"This night (you may my Almanack believe)\r\n  Is the return of famous Christmas Eve:\r\n  Ye virgins then your cleanly rooms prepare,\r\n  And let the windows bays and laurels wear;\r\n  Your _Rosemary_ preserve to dress your _Beef_,\r\n  Not forget me, which I advise in chief.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS, AT HADDON HALL,\r\n\r\nwas magnificently kept in the early part of the eighteenth century.\r\nThe amount of good cheer that was required for the table may be\r\nreadily imagined from the magnitude of the culinary furniture in the\r\nkitchen--two vast fireplaces, with irons for sustaining a surprising\r\nnumber of spits, and several enormous chopping-blocks--which survived\r\nto the nineteenth century. John, the ninth Earl and first Duke of\r\nRutland (created Marquis of Granby and Duke of Rutland in 1703),\r\nrevived in the ancient spirit the hospitality of Christmastide. He\r\nkept sevenscore servants, and his twelve days' feasts at Christmas\r\nrecalled the bountiful celebrations of the \"King of the Peak,\" Sir\r\nGeorge Vernon--the last male heir of the Vernon family in Derbyshire\r\nwho inherited the manor of Haddon, and who died in the seventh year of\r\nQueen Elizabeth's reign. \"The King of the Peak\" was the father of the\r\ncharming Dorothy Vernon, the fair heiress, whose romantic elopement is\r\nthus depicted in \"Picturesque Europe\":--\"In the fullness of time\r\nDorothy loved, but her father did not approve. She determined to\r\nelope; and now we must fill, in fancy, the Long Gallery with the\r\nsplendour of a revel and the stately joy of a great ball in the time\r\nof Elizabeth. In the midst of the noise and excitement the fair young\r\ndaughter of the house steals unobserved away. She issues from _her_\r\ndoor, and her light feet fly with tremulous speed along the darkling\r\nTerrace, flecked with light from the blazing ball-room, till they\r\nreach a postern in the wall, which opens upon the void of the night\r\noutside dancing Haddon. At that postern some one is waiting eagerly\r\nfor her; waiting with swift horses. That some one is young Sir John\r\nManners, second son of the House of Rutland, and her own true love.\r\nThe anxious lovers mount, and ride rapidly and silently away; and so\r\nDorothy Vernon transfers Haddon to the owners of Belvoir; and the\r\nboar's head of Vernon becomes mingled, at Haddon, with the peacock of\r\nManners. We fancy with sympathetic pleasure that night-ride and the\r\nhurried marriage; and--forgetting that the thing happened 'ages long\r\nagone'--we wish, with full hearts, all happiness to the dear and\r\ncharming Dorothy!\"\r\n\r\nFrom the boar's head of Vernon and the peacock of Manners, thought\r\npasses quite naturally to the boar's head and peacock, which were\r\nprincipal items of Christmas fare in the olden time.\r\n\r\nIn her \"Collected Writings,\" Janetta, Duchess of Rutland, gives an\r\ninteresting account of a revival of some of the ancient glories of\r\nHaddon:\r\n\r\n\"In the winter of 1872 the late Duke entertained the Prince and\r\nPrincess of Wales in the banqueting hall at luncheon, when the boar's\r\nhead and peacock in pride were carried in, and formed part of the\r\nfare, as in olden days: while once more musicians filled the\r\nminstrels' gallery, great logs blazed in the huge fireplace, and\r\nscarlet hangings were spread over the walls.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ANCIENT FIREPLACE.]\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of February, 1702, King William III. fell from his horse,\r\nbreaking his collar-bone and sustaining other serious injuries, which\r\nterminated fatally on Sunday, the 8th of March. He was succeeded by\r\nQueen Anne, who was the second daughter of King James II., and the\r\nlast of the Stuart sovereigns.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUEEN ANNE KEPT A ROYAL CHRISTMAS\r\n\r\nat Windsor, in 1703, and entertained the new King of Spain, who\r\narrived at Spithead on the 26th of December. \"The Queen dispatched the\r\nDukes of Somerset and Marlborough to conduct him to Windsor, and\r\nPrince George met him on the way at Petworth, the seat of the Duke of\r\nSomerset, and conducted him to Windsor on the 29th. The King was\r\nentertained in great state for three days at Windsor, during which\r\ntime he was politic enough to ingratiate himself with the Duchess of\r\nMarlborough. When the Duchess presented the basin and napkin after\r\nsupper to the Queen for her to wash her hands, the King gallantly took\r\nthe napkin and held it himself, and on returning it to the Queen's\r\ngreat favourite, he presented her with a superb diamond ring. After\r\nthree days the King returned to Portsmouth, and on the 4th of January,\r\n1704, he embarked on board the fleet commanded by Sir George Rooke,\r\nfor Portugal, accompanied by a body of land forces under the Duke of\r\nSchomberg. The voyage was, however, a most stormy one, and when the\r\nfleet had nearly reached Cape Finisterre, it was compelled to put back\r\nto Spithead, where it remained till the middle of February. His next\r\nattempt was more successful, and he landed in Lisbon amid much popular\r\ndemonstration, though the court itself was sunk in sorrow by the death\r\nof the Infanta, whom he went to marry.\"[75]\r\n\r\nAt the Christmas festivities the following year (1704) there were\r\ngreat rejoicings over the return home of the Duke of Marlborough from\r\nthe continental wars. \"He arrived in England in the middle of\r\nDecember, carrying with him Marshal Tallard and the rest of the\r\ndistinguished officers, with the standards and other trophies of his\r\nvictories. He was received with acclaim by all classes, except a few\r\nUltra Tories, who threatened to impeach him for his rash march to the\r\nDanube. As Parliament had assembled, Marlborough took his seat in the\r\nHouse of Peers the day after his arrival, where he was complimented on\r\nhis magnificent success by the Lord Keeper. This was followed by a\r\ndeputation with a vote of thanks from the Commons, and by similar\r\nhonours from the City. But perhaps the most palpable triumph of\r\nMarlborough was the transferring of the military trophies which he had\r\ntaken from the Tower, where they were first deposited, to Westminster\r\nHall. This was done by each soldier carrying a standard or other\r\ntrophy, amid the thunders of artillery and the hurrahs of the people;\r\nsuch a spectacle never having been witnessed since the days of the\r\nSpanish Armada. The Royal Manor of Woodstock was granted him, and\r\nBlenheim Mansion erected at the cost of the nation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS-KEEPING IN THE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nThe country squire of three hundred a year, an independent gentleman\r\nin the reign of Queen Anne, is described as having \"never played at\r\ncards but at Christmas, when the family pack was produced from the\r\nmantle-piece.\" \"His chief drink the year round was generally ale,\r\nexcept at this season, the 5th of November, or some gala days, when he\r\nwould make a bowl of strong brandy punch, garnished with a toast and\r\nnutmeg. In the corner of his hall, by the fireside, stood a large\r\nwooden two-armed chair, with a cushion, and within the chimney corner\r\nwere a couple of seats. Here, at Christmas, he entertained his\r\ntenants, assembled round a glowing fire, made of the roots of trees,\r\nand other great logs, and told and heard the traditionary tales of the\r\nvillage, respecting ghosts and witches, till fear made them afraid to\r\nmove. In the meantime the jorum of ale was in continual\r\ncirculation.\"[76]\r\n\r\n \"This is Yuletide! Bring the holly boughs,\r\n    Deck the old mansion with its berries red;\r\n  Bring in the mistletoe, that lover's vows\r\n    Be sweetly sealed the while it hangs o'erhead.\r\n  Pile on the logs, fresh gathered from the wood,\r\n    And let the firelight dance upon the walls,\r\n  The while we tell the stories of the good,\r\n    The brave, the noble, that the past recalls.\"[77]\r\n\r\nMany interesting tales respecting the manners and customs of the\r\neighteenth century are given by Steele and Addison in their well-known\r\nseries of papers entitled the _Spectator_. Charity and hospitality are\r\nconspicuous traits of the typical country gentleman of the period, Sir\r\nRoger de Coverley. \"Sir Roger,\" says the _Spectator_, \"after the\r\nlaudable custom of his ancestors, always keeps open house at\r\nChristmas. I learned from him, that he had killed eight fat hogs for\r\nthis season; that he had dealt about his chines very liberally amongst\r\nhis neighbours; and that in particular he had sent a string of hog's\r\npuddings with a pack of cards to every poor family in the parish. 'I\r\nhave often thought,' says Sir Roger, 'it happens well that Christmas\r\nshould fall out in the middle of winter. It is the most dead\r\nuncomfortable time of the year, when the poor people would suffer very\r\nmuch from their poverty and cold, if they had not good cheer, warm\r\nfires, and Christmas gambols to support them. I love to rejoice their\r\npoor hearts at this season, and to see the whole village merry in my\r\ngreat hall. I allow a double quantity of malt to my small beer, and\r\nset it running for twelve days to every one that calls for it. I have\r\nalways a piece of cold beef and a mince-pie upon the table, and am\r\nwonderfully pleased to see my tenants pass away a whole evening in\r\nplaying their innocent tricks, and smutting one another. Our friend\r\nWill Wimble is as merry as any of them, and shows a thousand roguish\r\ntricks upon these occasions.\"\r\n\r\nPuppet-shows and other scenic exhibitions with moving figures were\r\namong the Christmas amusements in the reign of Queen Anne. Strutt\r\nquotes a description of such an exhibition \"by the manager of a show\r\nexhibited at the great house in the Strand, over against the Globe\r\nTavern, near Hungerford Market; the best places at one shilling and\r\nthe others at sixpence each: 'To be seen, the greatest Piece of\r\nCuriosity that ever arrived in England, being made by a famous\r\nengineer from the camp before Lisle, who, with great labour and\r\nindustry, has collected into a moving picture the following figures:\r\nfirst, it doth represent the confederate camp, and the army lying\r\nintrenched before the town; secondly, the convoys and the mules with\r\nPrince Eugene's baggage; thirdly, the English forces commanded by the\r\nDuke of Marlborough; likewise, several vessels laden with provisions\r\nfor the army, which are so artificially done as to seem to drive the\r\nwater before them. The city and the citadel are very fine, with all\r\nits outworks, ravelins, horn-works, counter-scarps, half-moons, and\r\npalisades; the French horse marching out at one gate, and the\r\nconfederate army marching in at the other; the prince's travelling\r\ncoach with two generals in it, one saluting the company as it passes\r\nby; then a trumpeter sounds a call as he rides, at the noise whereof a\r\nsleeping sentinel starts, and lifts up his head, but, not being\r\nespied, lies down to sleep again; beside abundance more admirable\r\ncuriosities too tedious to be inserted here.' He then modestly adds,\r\n'In short, the whole piece is so contrived by art that it seems to be\r\nlife and nature.'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DRUID PRIESTESS BEARING MISTLETOE.]\r\n\r\nTumbling and feats of agility were also fashionable during the\r\nChristmas festival at this period, for in one of the _Tatlers_ (No.\r\n115, dated January 3, 1709) the following passage occurs: \"I went on\r\nFriday last to the Opera, and was surprised to find a thin house at\r\nso noble an entertainment, 'till I heard that the tumbler was not to\r\nmake his appearance that night.\" The sword-dance--dancing \"among the\r\npoints of swords and spears with most wonderful agility, and even with\r\nthe most elegant and graceful motions\"--rope-dancing, feats of\r\nbalancing, leaping and vaulting, tricks by horses and other animals,\r\nand bull-baiting and bear-baiting were also among the public\r\namusements. And _Hot Cockles_ was one of the favourite indoor\r\namusements of Christmastide. Strutt, in his \"Sports and Pastimes,\"\r\nsays, _Hot Cockles_ is from the French _hautes-coquilles_, \"a play in\r\nwhich one kneels, and covering his eyes, lays his head in another's\r\nlap and guesses who struck him.\" John Gay, a poet of the time, thus\r\npleasantly writes of the game:--\r\n\r\n \"As at Hot Cockles once I laid me down,\r\n  And felt the weighty hand of many a clown,\r\n  Buxoma gave a gentle tap, and I\r\n  Quick rose, and read soft mischief in her eye.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn the death of Queen Anne (August 11, 1714) Prince George Louis of\r\nHanover was proclaimed King of England as\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE THE FIRST.\r\n\r\nThere was little change in the Christmas festivities in this reign,\r\nfor, as Mr. Thackeray says in his lively sketch of George I.: \"He was\r\na moderate ruler of England. His aim was to leave it to itself as much\r\nas possible, and to live out of it as much as he could. His heart was\r\nin Hanover.\" The most important addition to the plays of the period\r\nwas\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTMAS PANTOMIME.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A NEST OF FOOLS]\r\n\r\nIn his \"English Plays,\" Professor Henry Morley thus records the\r\nintroduction of the modern English pantomime, which has since been the\r\ngreat show of Christmastide:--\r\n\r\n\"The theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields, which Christopher Rich had been\r\nrestoring, his son, John Rich, was allowed to open on the 18th of\r\nDecember, 1714. John Rich was a clever mimic, and after a year or two\r\nhe found it to his advantage to compete with the actors in a fashion\r\nof his own. He was the inventor of the modern English form of\r\npantomime, with a serious part that he took from Ovid's Metamorphosis\r\nor any fabulous history, and a comic addition of the courtship of\r\nharlequin and columbine, with surprising tricks and transformations.\r\nHe introduced the old Italian characters of pantomime under changed\r\nconditions, and beginning with 'Harlequin Sorcerer' in 1717, continued\r\nto produce these entertainments until a year before his death in 1761.\r\nThey have since been retained as Christmas shows upon the English\r\nstage.\"\r\n\r\nIn a note to \"The Dunciad,\" Pope complains of \"the extravagancies\r\nintroduced on the stage, and frequented by persons of the first\r\nquality in England to the twentieth and thirtieth time,\" and states\r\nthat \"_all_ the extravagances\" in the following lines of the poem\r\nactually appeared on the stage:--\r\n\r\n \"See now, what Dulness and her sons admire!\r\n  See what the charms, that smite the simple heart\r\n  Not touch'd by nature, and not reach'd by art.\r\n  His never-blushing head he turn'd aside,\r\n  (Not half so pleased when Goodman prophesied)\r\n  And look'd, and saw a sable Sorcerer rise,\r\n  Swift to whose hand a winged volume flies:\r\n  All sudden, gorgons hiss, and dragons glare,\r\n  And ten-horn'd fiends and giants rush to war.\r\n  Hell rises, Heaven descends, and dance on earth:\r\n  Gods, imps, and monsters, music, rage, and mirth,\r\n  A fire, a jig, a battle, and a ball,\r\n  Till one wide conflagration swallows all.\r\n    Thence a new world, to nature's laws unknown,\r\n  Breaks out refulgent, with a heaven its own:\r\n  Another Cynthia her new journey runs,\r\n  And other planets circle other suns.\r\n  The forests dance, the rivers upward rise,\r\n  Whales sport in woods, and dolphins in the skies;\r\n  And last, to give the whole creation grace,\r\n  Lo! one vast egg produces human race.\"\r\n\r\nDavid Garrick, the eminent actor, wrote in a similar strain, finding\r\nit hard to hold his own against the patrons of the pantomime:--\r\n\r\n \"They in the drama find no joys,\r\n  But doat on mimicry and toys.\r\n  Thus, when a dance is in my bill,\r\n  Nobility my boxes fill;\r\n  Or send three days before the time,\r\n  To crowd a new-made pantomime.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"OLD MERRY PLENTIFUL CHRISTMAS,\"\r\n\r\nat this period, is sketched by a writer in _Poor Robin's Almanack_,\r\nfor 1723, thus:--\"Now comes on old merry plentiful Christmas. The\r\nHusbandman lays his great Log behind the fire, and with a few of his\r\nneighbours, over a good fire, taps his Christmas beer, cuts his\r\nChristmas cheese, and sets forward for a merry Christmas. The Landlord\r\n(for we hope there are yet some generous ones left) invites his\r\nTenants and Labourers, and with a good Sirloin of Roast Beef, and a\r\nfew pitchers of nappy ale or beer, he wisheth them all a merry\r\nChristmas. The beggar begs his bread, sells some of it for money to\r\nbuy drink, and without fear of being arrested, or call'd upon for\r\nparish duties, has as merry a Christmas as any of them all.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE MASK DANCE.\"]\r\n\r\nSo the people made merry at Christmas throughout the reign of George\r\nI., who died on June 10, 1727, and was succeeded by his son,\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE THE SECOND.\r\n\r\nIn this reign the customs of Christmas were kept up with unabated\r\nheartiness, and liberality to the poor was not forgotten. The\r\ncustomary distributions of creature comforts on Christmas Eve were\r\ncontinued, and, in some instances, provision for the maintenance of\r\nthem was made in the wills of worthy parishioners. An instance of this\r\nkind is recorded in Devonshire. \"It appears, from a statement of\r\ncharities in an old book, that John Martyn, by will, 28th of November,\r\n1729, gave to the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of the\r\nparish of St. Mary Major, Exeter, twenty pounds, to be put out at\r\ninterest, and the profits thereof to be laid out every Christmas Eve\r\nin twenty pieces of beef, to be distributed to twenty poor people of\r\nthe parish, such as had no relief on that day, for ever.\"[78]\r\n\r\nThat\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS HOUSEKEEPING IN LONDON,\r\n\r\nat this period, was excellent, both as to quantity and quality, is\r\nevident, from a contribution made to _Read's Weekly Journal_, of\r\nSaturday, January 9, 1731, by Mr. Thomas North, who thus describes the\r\nChristmas entertainment and good cheer he met with in London at the\r\nhouse of a friend: \"It was the house of an eminent and worthy\r\nmerchant, and tho', sir, I have been accustomed in my own country to\r\nwhat may very well be called good housekeeping, yet I assure you I\r\nshould have taken this dinner to have been provided for a whole\r\nparish, rather than for about a dozen gentlemen: 'Tis impossible for\r\nme to give you half our bill of fare, so you must be content to know\r\nthat we had turkies, geese, capons, puddings of a dozen sorts more\r\nthan I had ever seen in my life, besides brawn, roast beef, and many\r\nthings of which I know not the names, minc'd pyes in abundance, and a\r\nthing they call plumb pottage, which may be good for ought I know,\r\nthough it seems to me to have 50 different tastes. Our wines were of\r\nthe best, as were all the rest of our liquors; in short, the God of\r\nplenty seemed to reign here, and to make everything perfect, our\r\ncompany was polite and every way agreeable; nothing but mirth and\r\nloyal healths went round. If a stranger were to have made an estimate\r\nof London from this place, he would imagine it not only the most rich\r\nbut the most happy city in the world.\"\r\n\r\nAnother interesting item of this period is the following--\r\n\r\n\r\nCURIOUS CHRISTMAS ADVERTISEMENT,\r\n\r\nwhich has been cut from some publication and (by the late Mr. Joseph\r\nHaslewood) inserted between pages 358 and 359 of the British Museum\r\nlarge paper copy of Brand's \"Antiquities,\" and dated December, 1739:--\r\n\r\n\"This day is published, Price 6d.\r\n\r\n\"THE TRIAL OF OLD FATHER CHRISTMAS for encouraging his Majesty's\r\nsubjects in Idleness, Drunkenness, Gaming, Rioting, and all manner of\r\nExtravagance and Debauchery, at the Assizes held in the city of\r\nProfusion before the Lord Chief Justice Churchman, Mr. Justice Feast,\r\nMr. Justice Gambol, and several other his Majesty's Justices of Oyer\r\nand Terminer, and Gaol-Delivery.\r\n\r\n\"To which is added a Diary found in the Pocket of Old Father\r\nChristmas, with Directions to all Lovers of him how to welcome their\r\nneighbours; likewise the Judge's sentence and Opinion how Christmas\r\nought to be kept; and further Witty Tales and Merry Stories designed\r\nfor Christmas Evenings Diversion, when round about our Coal Fire.\r\n\r\nBy Josiah King,\r\n\r\nPrinter for T.

And what was worse than this, she must not play with the\r\nYoung Fellows that Day, but stand Neuter, like a Girl doing penance in\r\na Winding-sheet at a Church-door.\r\n\r\n\"But now let us enquire a little farther, to arrive at the Sense of\r\nthe Thing; this great Festival was in former Times kept with so much\r\nFreedom and Openness of Heart, that every one in the Country where a\r\nGentleman resided, possessed at least a Day of Pleasure in the\r\n_Christmas_ Holydays; the Tables were all spread from the first to the\r\nlast, the Sir-Loyns of Beef, the Minc'd-Pies, the Plumb-Porridge, the\r\nCapons, Turkeys, Geese, and Plumb-Puddings, were all brought upon the\r\nboard; and all those who had sharp stomachs and sharp Knives eat\r\nheartily and were welcome, which gave rise to the Proverb--\r\n\r\n  _Merry in the Hall, when Beards wag all._\"\r\n\r\n\"There were then Turnspits employed, who by the time Dinner was over,\r\nwould look as black and as greasy as a Welch Porridge-pot, but the\r\nJacks have since turned them all out of Doors. The Geese which used to\r\nbe fatted for the honest Neighbours, have been of late sent to\r\n_London_, and the Quills made into Pens to convey away the Landlord's\r\nEstate; the Sheep are drove away to raise Money to answer the Loss of\r\na Game at Dice or Cards, and their Skins made into Parchment for Deeds\r\nand Indentures; nay even the poor innocent Bee, who used to pay its\r\nTribute to the Lord once a Year at least in good Metheglin, for the\r\nEntertainment of the Guests, and its Wax converted into beneficial\r\nPlaisters for sick Neighbours, is now used for the sealing of Deeds to\r\nhis Disadvantage.\r\n\r\n\"But give me the Man _who has a good Heart_, and has Spirit enough to\r\nkeep up the Old way of Hospitality, feeds his People till they are as\r\nplump as Partridges, and as fat as Porpoises that every Servant may\r\nappear as jolly as the late Bishop of _Winchester's_ Porter at\r\n_Chelsea_.\r\n\r\n\"The News-Papers however inform us, that the Spirit of Hospitality has\r\nnot quite forsaken us; for three or four of them tell us, that several\r\nof the Gentry are gone down to their respective Seats in the Country,\r\nin order to keep their _Christmas_ in the Old Way, and entertain their\r\nTenants and Trades-folks as their Ancestors used to do and I wish them\r\na merry _Christmas_ accordingly. I must also take notice to the stingy\r\nTribe, that if they don't at least make their Tenants or Tradesmen\r\ndrink when they come to see them in the Christmas Holydays, they have\r\nLiberty of retaliating which is a Law of very ancient Date.\r\n\r\n\"A merry Gentleman of my Acquaintance desires I will insert, that the\r\nold Folks in Days of yore kept open House at _Christmas_ out of\r\nInterest; for then, says he, they receive the greatest Part of their\r\nRent in Kind; such as Wheat, Barley or Malt, Oxen, Calves, Sheep,\r\nSwine, Turkeys, Capon, Geese, and such like; and they not having Room\r\nenough to preserve their Grain, or Fodder enough to preserve their\r\nCattle or Poultry, nor Markets to sell off the Overplus, they were\r\nobliged to use them in their own Houses; and by treating the People of\r\nthe Country, gained Credit amongst them, and riveted the Minds and\r\nGoodwill of their Neighbours so firmly in them, that no one durst\r\nventure to oppose them. The 'Squire's Will was done whatever came on\r\nit; for if he happened to ask a Neighbour what it was a Clock, they\r\nreturned with a low Scrape, it is what your Worship pleases.\r\n\r\n\"The Dancing and Singing of the Benchers in the great Inns of Court in\r\n_Christmas_, is in some sort founded upon Interest; for they hold, as\r\nI am informed, some Priviledge by Dancing about the Fire in the middle\r\nof their Hall, and singing the Song of _Round about our Coal Fire_,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n\"This time of year being cold and frosty generally speaking, or when\r\nJack-Frost commonly takes us by the Nose, the Diversions are within\r\nDoors, either in Exercise or by the Fire-side.\r\n\r\n\"Country-Dancing is one of the chief Exercises....\r\n\r\n\"Then comes Mumming or Masquerading, when the 'Squire's Wardrobe is\r\nransacked for Dresses of all Kinds, and the coal-hole searched\r\naround, or corks burnt to black the Faces of the Fair, or make\r\nDeputy-Mustaches, and every one in the Family except the 'Squire\r\nhimself must be transformed from what they were....\r\n\r\n\"Or else there is a Match at _Blind-Man's-Buff_, and then it is lawful\r\nto set anything in the way for Folks to tumble over....\r\n\r\n\"As for _Puss in the Corner_, that is a very harmless Sport, and one\r\nmay romp at it as much as one will....\r\n\r\n\"The next game to this is _Questions and Commands_, when the Commander\r\nmay oblige his Subject to answer any lawful Question, and make the\r\nsame obey him instantly, under the penalty of being smutted, or paying\r\nsuch Forfeit as may be laid on the Aggressor; but the Forfeits being\r\ngenerally fixed at some certain Price, as a Shilling, Half a Crown,\r\n&c., so every one knowing what to do if they should be too stubborn to\r\nsubmit, make themselves easy at discretion.\r\n\r\n\"As for the Game of _Hoop and Hide_, the Parties have the Liberty of\r\nhiding where they will, in any part of the House; and if they happen\r\nto be caught, the Dispute ends in Kissing, &c.\r\n\r\n\"Most of the other Diversions are Cards and Dice, but they are seldom\r\nset on foot, unless a Lawyer is at hand, to breed some dispute for him\r\nto decide, or at least have some Party in.\r\n\r\n\"And now I come to another Entertainment frequently used, which is of\r\nthe Story-telling Order, _viz._ of Hobgoblins, Witches, Conjurers,\r\nGhosts, Fairies, and such like common Disturbers.\"\r\n\r\nAt this period\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVID GARRICK'S CHRISTMAS ACTING\r\n\r\nwon him great applause. At Christmas, 1741, he brought out at\r\nGoodman's Fields a Christmas Farce, written by himself, entitled \"The\r\nLying Valet,\" wherein the great actor took the part of \"Sharp.\" It was\r\nthought the most diverting farce ever performed. \"There was a general\r\nroar from beginning to end. So great was his versatility that people\r\nwere not able to determine whether he was best in tragedy or comedy.\"\r\nOn his benefit, when his real name was placed on the bills for the\r\nfirst time, there was an immense gathering, and the applause was quite\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\nThe Christmas festivities of 1745 were marred by the\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTURBANCES OF THE JACOBITES,\r\n\r\nunder the romantic \"Prince Charlie,\" whose attempted invasion of\r\nEngland speedily collapsed.\r\n\r\nPointer, in his _Oxoniensis Academia_ (1749) refers to\r\n\r\n\r\nAN OLD CHRISTMAS CUSTOM\r\n\r\nof this period. He states that at Merton College, Oxford, the Fellows\r\nmeet together in the Hall, on Christmas Eve, to sing a Psalm and drink\r\na grace-cup to one another (called _Poculum Charitatis_), wishing one\r\nanother health and happiness.\r\n\r\nThe Christmas of 1752 was\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST CHRISTMAS UNDER THE \"NEW STYLE,\"\r\n\r\nand many refused to observe the festival eleven days earlier than\r\nusual, but insisted on keeping \"Old Christmas Day.\" Why should they be\r\nrobbed of eleven days by a new Act of Parliament? It was of no use to\r\ntell them that it had been discovered that the fractional few minutes\r\nwhich are tailed on to the days and hours which make up the year had,\r\nby neglect through many centuries, brought us into a wrong condition,\r\nand that to set us right it would be necessary to give credit for\r\neleven days which nobody was conscious of having enjoyed. The law,\r\nhowever, had said that it should be so. Accordingly, the day after the\r\n2nd of September, 1752, was called the 14th, to the great indignation\r\nof thousands, who reckoned that they had thus been cut off from nearly\r\na fortnight of life which honestly belonged to them. These persons\r\nsturdily refused to acknowledge the Christmas Eve and Day of the new\r\ncalendar. They averred that the true festival was that which now began\r\non the 5th of January _next year_. They would go to church, they said,\r\non no other day; nor eat mince-pies nor drink punch but in reference\r\nto this one day. The clergy had a hard time of it with these\r\nrecusants. It will be well, therefore, to quote one singular example\r\nto show how this recusancy was encountered. It is from a collection of\r\npamphlet-sermons preserved by George III., none of which, however,\r\nhave anything curious or particularly meritorious about them save this\r\none, which was preached on Friday, January 5, 1753, \"Old Christmas\r\nDay.\" Mr. Francis Blackburne, \"one of the candid disquisitors,\" opened\r\nhis church on that day, which was crowded by a congregation anxious to\r\nsee the day celebrated as that of the anniversary of the Nativity. The\r\nservice for Christmas Day, however, was not used. \"I will answer your\r\nexpectations so far,\" said the preacher in his sermon, \"as to give you\r\na _sermon on the day_; and the rather because I perceive you are\r\ndisappointed of _something else_ that you expected.\" The purport of\r\nthe discourse is to show that the change of style was desirable, and\r\nthat it having been effected by Act of Parliament, with the sanction\r\nof the King, there was nothing for it but acquiescence. \"For,\" says\r\nthe preacher, \"had I, to oblige you, disobeyed this Act of Parliament,\r\nit is very probable I might have lost my benefice, which, you know, is\r\nall the subsistence I have in the world; and I should have been\r\nrightly served; for who am I that I should fly in the face of his\r\nMajesty and the Parliament? These things are left to be ordered by the\r\nhigher powers; and in any such case as that, I hope not to think\r\nmyself wiser than the King, the whole nobility, and principal gentry\r\nof Great Britain\"!!\r\n\r\nThe peasants of Buckinghamshire, however, pitched upon a very pretty\r\nmethod to settle the question of Christmas, left so meekly by Mr.\r\nBlackburne to the King, nobility, and most of the gentry. They\r\nbethought themselves of a blackthorn near one of their villages; and\r\nthis thorn was for the nonce declared to be the growth of a slip from\r\nthe Christmas-flowering thorn at Glastonbury. If the Buckinghamshire\r\nthorn, so argued the peasants, will only blossom in the night of the\r\n24th of December, we will go to church next day, and allow that the\r\nChristmas by Act of Parliament is the true Christmas; but no blossom\r\nno feast, and there shall be no revel till the eve of old Christmas\r\nDay. They watched the thorn and drank to its budding; but as it\r\nproduced no promise of a flower by the morning, they turned to go\r\nhomewards as best they might, perfectly satisfied with the success of\r\nthe experiment. Some were interrupted in their way by their respective\r\n\"vicars,\" who took them by the arm and would fain have persuaded them\r\nto go to church. They argued the question by field, stile, and\r\nchurch-gate; but not a Bucks peasant would consent to enter a pew till\r\nthe parson had promised to preach a sermon to, and smoke a pipe with,\r\nthem on the only Christmas Day they chose to acknowledge.\r\n\r\nNow, however, this old prejudice has been conquered, and the \"new\r\nstyle\" has maintained its ground. It has even done more, for its\r\nauthors have so arranged the years and leap years that a confusion in\r\nthe time of Christmas or any other festival is not likely to occur\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n    [75] Cassell's \"History of England.\"\r\n\r\n    [76] Grose.\r\n\r\n    [77] Herbert H.

After the sermon was over,\r\nhis Majesty, Prince Edward and Princess Augusta went into the Chapel\r\nRoyal, and received the sacrament from the hands of the Bishop of\r\nDurham; and the King offered the byzant, or wedge of gold, in a purse,\r\nfor the benefit of the poor, and the royal family all made offerings.\r\nHis Majesty afterwards dined with his royal mother at Leicester House,\r\nand in the evening returned to St. James's.\"[79]\r\n\r\nAt this period\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAVOURITE CHRISTMAS DIVERSION\r\n\r\nwas card-playing. The King himself spent a great deal of his time in\r\nplaying at cards with the ladies and gentlemen of his court. In doing\r\nso, however, he was but following the example of George II., of whom\r\nthe biographer already quoted (Mr. Huish) says:--\r\n\r\n\"After the death of Queen Caroline, the King was very fond of a game\r\nat cards with the Countess of Pembroke, Albemarle, and other\r\ndistinguished ladies. His attachment to cards was transferred to his\r\nattachment for the ladies, and it was said that what he gained by the\r\none he lost by the other.\" Cards were very much resorted to at the\r\nfamily parties and other social gatherings held during the twelve days\r\nof Christmas. Hone makes various allusions to card-playing at\r\nChristmastide, and Washington Irving, in his \"Life of Oliver\r\nGoldsmith,\" pictures the poet \"keeping the card-table in an uproar.\"\r\nMrs. Bunbury invited Goldsmith down to Barton to pass the Christmas\r\nholidays. Irving regrets \"that we have no record of this Christmas\r\nvisit to Barton; that the poet had no Boswell to follow at his heels,\r\nand take notes of all his sayings and doings. We can only picture him\r\nin our minds, casting off all care; enacting the Lord of Misrule;\r\npresiding at the Christmas revels; providing all kinds of merriment;\r\nkeeping the card-table in an uproar, and finally opening the ball on\r\nthe first day of the year in his spring-velvet suit, with the Jessamy\r\nBride for a partner.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the reprint additions made in the British Museum large paper copy\r\nof Brand's \"Antiquities,\" by the late Mr. Joseph Haslewood, and dated\r\nJanuary, 1779, we quote the following verses descriptive of the\r\nconcluding portion of the Christmas festivities at this period:--\r\n\r\nTWELFTH DAY.\r\n\r\n  Now the jovial girls and boys,\r\n    Struggling for the cake and plumbs,\r\n  Testify their eager joys,\r\n    And lick their fingers and their thumbs.\r\n\r\n  Statesmen like, they struggle still,\r\n    Scarcely hands kept out of dishes,\r\n  And yet, when they have had their fill,\r\n    Still anxious for the loaves and fishes.\r\n\r\n  Kings and Queens, in petty state,\r\n    Now their sovereign will declare,\r\n  But other sovereigns' plans they hate,\r\n    Full fond of peace--detesting war.\r\n\r\n  One moral from this tale appears,\r\n    Worth notice when a world's at stake;\r\n  That all our hopes and all our fears,\r\n    Are but a _struggling for the_ Cake.\r\n\r\nOther particulars of the\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPULAR CHRISTMAS FESTIVITIES\r\n\r\nin the latter part of the eighteenth century are gleaned from\r\ncontemporary writers:--\r\n\r\n\"At Ripon, on Christmas Eve, the grocers, send each of their customers\r\na pound or half of currants and raisins to make a Christmas pudding.\r\nThe chandlers also send large mould candles, and the coopers logs of\r\nwood, generally called _Yule clogs_, which are always used on\r\nChristmas Eve; but should it be so large as not to be all burnt that\r\nnight, which is frequently the case, the remains are kept till old\r\nChristmas Eve.\"[80]\r\n\r\nIn Sinclair's Account of Scotland, parish of Kirkden, county of Angus\r\n(1792), Christmas is said to be held as a great festival in the\r\nneighbourhood. \"The servant is free from his master, and goes about\r\nvisiting his friends and acquaintance. The poorest must have beef or\r\nmutton on the table, and what they call a dinner with their friends.\r\nMany amuse themselves with various diversions, particularly with\r\nshooting for prizes, called here _wad-shooting_; and many do but\r\nlittle business all the Christmas week; the evening of almost every\r\nday being spent in amusement.\" And in the account of Keith, in\r\nBanffshire, the inhabitants are said to \"have no pastimes or holidays,\r\nexcept dancing on Christmas and New Year's Day.\"\r\n\r\nBoyhood's Christmas Breaking-up is thus described in a poem entitled\r\n\"Christmas\" (Bristol, 1795):--\r\n\r\n \"A school there was, within a well-known town,\r\n  (Bridgwater call'd), in which the boys were wont,\r\n  At _breaking-up_ for Christmas' lov'd recess,\r\n  To meet the master, on the happy morn,\r\n  At early hour; the custom, too, prevail'd,\r\n  That he who first the seminary reach'd\r\n  Should, instantly, perambulate the streets\r\n  With sounding horn, to rouse his fellows up;\r\n  And, as a compensation for his care,\r\n  His flourish'd copies, and his chapter-task,\r\n  Before the rest, he from the master had.\r\n  For many days, ere breaking-up commenced,\r\n  Much was the clamour, 'mongst the beardless crowd,\r\n  Who first would dare his well-warm'd bed forego,\r\n  And, round the town, with horn of ox equipp'd,\r\n  His schoolmates call. Great emulation glow'd\r\n  In all their breasts; but, when the morning came,\r\n  Straightway was heard, resounding through the streets,\r\n  The pleasing blast (more welcome far, to them,\r\n  Than is, to sportsmen, the delightful cry\r\n  Of hounds on chase), which soon together brought\r\n  A tribe of boys, who, thund'ring at the doors\r\n  Of those, their fellows, sunk in Somnus' arms,\r\n  Great hubbub made, and much the town alarm'd.\r\n  At length the gladsome, congregated throng,\r\n  Toward the school their willing progress bent,\r\n  With loud huzzas, and, crowded round the desk,\r\n  Where sat the master busy at his books,\r\n  In reg'lar order, each receiv'd his own,\r\n  The youngsters then, enfranchised from the school,\r\n  Their fav'rite sports pursued.\"\r\n\r\nA writer in the _Gentleman's Magazine_ for February, 1795, gives the\r\nfollowing account of a Christmas Eve custom at the house of Sir ----\r\nHolt, Bart., of Aston, near Birmingham:\r\n\r\n\"As soon as supper is over, a table is set in the hall. On it is\r\nplaced a brown loaf, with twenty silver threepences stuck on the top\r\nof it, a tankard of ale, with pipes and tobacco; and the two oldest\r\nservants have chairs behind it, to sit as judges if they please. The\r\nsteward brings the servants, both men and women, by one at a time,\r\ncovered with a winnow-sheet, and lays their right hand on the loaf,\r\nexposing no other part of the body. The oldest of the two judges\r\nguesses at the person, by naming a name, then the younger judge, and\r\nlastly the oldest again. If they hit upon the right name, the steward\r\nleads the person back again; but, if they do not, he takes off the\r\nwinnow-sheet, and the person receives a threepence, makes a low\r\nobeisance to the judges, but speaks not a word. When the second\r\nservant was brought, the younger judge guessed first and third; and\r\nthis they did alternately, till all the money was given away.

You have\r\nno turkeys; you would not desecrate the festival by offering up a\r\nwithered Chinese bantam, instead of the savoury grand Norfolcian\r\nholocaust, that smokes all around my nostrils at this moment from a\r\nthousand firesides. Then what puddings have you? Where will you get\r\nholly to stick in your churches, or churches to stick your dried\r\ntea-leaves (that must be the substitute) in? Come out of Babylon, O my\r\nfriend.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ITALIAN MINSTRELS IN LONDON, AT CHRISTMAS, 1825.\r\n(_From a sketch of that period._)]\r\n\r\n \"Ranged in a row, with guitars slung\r\n  Before them thus, they played and sung:\r\n  Their instruments and choral voice\r\n  Bid each glad guest still more rejoice;\r\n  And each guest wish'd again to hear\r\n  Their wild guitars and voices clear.\"[82]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTMAS GAMES\r\n\r\nat the beginning of the nineteenth century include the old Christmas\r\ngame of _Forfeits_, for every breach of the rules of which the players\r\nhave to deposit some little article as a forfeit, to be redeemed by\r\nsome sportive penalty, imposed by the \"Crier of the Forfeits\" (usually\r\na bonnie lassie). The \"crying of the forfeits\" and paying of the\r\npenalties creates much merriment, particularly when a bashful youth is\r\nsentenced to \"kiss through the fire-tongs\" some beautiful romp of a\r\ngirl, who delights playing him tricks while the room rings with\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nSome of the old pastimes, however, have fallen into disuse, as, for\r\ninstance, the once popular game of _Hot Cockles_, _Hunt the Slipper_,\r\nand \"the vulgar game of _Post and Pair_\"; but _Cards_ are still\r\npopular, and Snapdragon continues such Christmas merriment as is set\r\nforth in the following verses:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSNAP DRAGON.\r\n\r\n \"Here he comes with flaming bowl,\r\n  Don't he mean to take his toll,\r\n                    Snip! Snap! Dragon!\r\n  Take care you don't take too much,\r\n  Be not greedy in your clutch,\r\n                    Snip! Snap!

Dragon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't 'ee fear him, be but bold,\" accords with the advice of a writer\r\nin \"Pantalogia,\" in 1813, who says that when the brandy in the bowl is\r\nset on fire, and raisins thrown into it, those who are unused to the\r\nsport are afraid to take out, but the raisins may be safely snatched\r\nby a quick motion and put blazing into the mouth, which being closed,\r\nthe fire is at once extinguished. The game requires both courage and\r\nrapidity of action, and a good deal of merriment is caused by the\r\nunsuccessful efforts of competitors for the raisins in the flaming\r\nbowl.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLINDMAN'S BUFF.\r\n\r\nA favourite game of Christmastide, is thus described by Thomas\r\nMiller, in his \"Sports and Pastimes of Merry England\":--\r\n\r\n\"The very youngest of our brothers and sisters can join in this old\r\nEnglish game: and it is selfish to select only such sports as they\r\ncannot become sharers of. Its ancient name is 'hoodman-blind'; and\r\nwhen hoods were worn by both men and women--centuries before hats and\r\ncaps were so common as they are now--the hood was reversed, placed\r\nhind-before, and was, no doubt, a much surer way of blinding the\r\nplayer than that now adopted--for we have seen Charley try to catch\r\nhis pretty cousin Caroline, by chasing her behind chairs and into all\r\nsorts of corners, to our strong conviction that he was not half so\r\nwell blinded as he ought to have been. Some said he could see through\r\nthe black silk handkerchief; others that it ought to have been tied\r\nclean over his nose, for that when he looked down he could see her\r\nfeet, wherever she moved; and Charley had often been heard to say that\r\nshe had the prettiest foot and ankle he had ever seen. But there he\r\ngoes, head over heels across a chair, tearing off Caroline's gown\r\nskirt in his fall, as he clutches it in the hope of saving himself.\r\nNow, that is what I call retributive justice; for she threw down the\r\nchair for him to stumble over, and, if he has grazed his knees, she\r\nsuffers under a torn dress, and must retire until one of the maids\r\ndarn up the rent. But now the mirth and glee grow 'fast and furious,'\r\nfor hoodman blind has imprisoned three or four of the youngest boys in\r\na corner, and can place his hand on whichever he likes. Into what a\r\nsmall compass they have forced themselves! But the one behind has the\r\nwall at his back, and, taking advantage of so good a purchase, he\r\nsends his three laughing companions sprawling on the floor, and is\r\nhimself caught through their having fallen, as his shoulder is the\r\nfirst that is grasped by Blindman-buff--so that he must now submit to\r\nbe hooded.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLINDMAN'S BUFF.\r\n(_In the last century_.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTMAS DANCE.\r\n\r\n \"Again the ball-room is wide open thrown,\r\n    The oak beams festooned with the garlands gay;\r\n  The red dais where the fiddlers sit alone,\r\n    Where, flushed with pride, the good old tunes they play.\r\n  Strike, fiddlers, strike!

During the Christmas holidays they\r\namuse themselves with a game of kamman, which consists in impelling a\r\nwooden ball with a crooked stick to a given point, while an adversary\r\nendeavours to drive it in a contrary direction.\"\r\n\r\nYORKSHIRE.\r\n\r\nA writer in \"Time's Telescope\" (1822) states that in Yorkshire at\r\neight o'clock on Christmas Eve the bells greet \"Old Father Christmas\"\r\nwith a merry peal, the children parade the streets with drums,\r\ntrumpets, bells, or perhaps, in their absence, with the poker and\r\nshovel, taken from their humble cottage fire; the yule candle is\r\nlighted, and--\r\n\r\n        \"High on the cheerful fire\r\n  Is blazing seen th' enormous Christmas brand.\"\r\n\r\nSupper is served, of which one dish, from the lordly mansion to the\r\nhumblest shed, is invariably furmety; yule cake, one of which is\r\nalways made for each individual in the family, and other more\r\nsubstantial viands are also added.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME SOCIAL FESTIVITIES\r\n\r\nof Christmastide are sketched by a contributor to the _New Monthly\r\nMagazine_, December 1, 1825, who says:--\r\n\r\n\"On the north side of the church at M. are a great many holly-trees.\r\nIt is from these that our dining and bed-rooms are furnished with\r\nboughs. Families take it by turns to entertain their friends. They\r\nmeet early; the beef and pudding are noble; the mince-pies--peculiar;\r\nthe nuts half play-things and half-eatables; the oranges as cold and\r\nacid as they ought to be, furnishing us with a superfluity which we\r\ncan afford to laugh at; the cakes indestructible; the wassail bowls\r\ngenerous, old English, huge, demanding ladles, threatening overflow as\r\nthey come in, solid with roasted apples when set down. Towards\r\nbed-time you hear of elder-wine, and not seldom of punch. At the\r\nmanorhouse it is pretty much the same as elsewhere. Girls, although\r\nthey be ladies, are kissed under the mistletoe. If any family among us\r\nhappen to have hit upon an exquisite brewing, they send some of it\r\nround about, the squire's house included; and he does the same by the\r\nrest. Riddles, hot-cockles, forfeits, music, dances sudden and not to\r\nbe suppressed, prevail among great and small; and from two o'clock in\r\nthe day to midnight, M. looks like a deserted place out of doors, but\r\nis full of life and merriment within. Playing at knights and ladies\r\nlast year, a jade of a charming creature must needs send me out for a\r\npiece of ice to put in her wine. It was evening and a hard frost. I\r\nshall never forget the cold, cutting, dreary, dead look of every thing\r\nout of doors, with a wind through the wiry trees, and the snow on the\r\nground, contrasted with the sudden return to warmth, light, and\r\njoviality.\r\n\r\n\"I remember we had a discussion that time as to what was the great\r\npoint and crowning glory of Christmas. Many were for mince-pie; some\r\nfor the beef and plum-pudding; more for the wassail-bowl; a maiden\r\nlady timidly said the mistletoe; but we agreed at last, that although\r\nall these were prodigious, and some of them exclusively belonging to\r\nthe season, the _fire_ was the great indispensable. Upon which we all\r\nturned our faces towards it, and began warming our already scorched\r\nhands. A great blazing fire, too big, is the visible heart and soul\r\nof Christmas. You may do without beef and plum-pudding; even the\r\nabsence of mince-pie may be tolerated; there must be a bowl,\r\npoetically speaking, but it need not be absolutely wassail. The bowl\r\nmay give place to the bottle. But a huge, heaped-up, _over_ heaped-up,\r\nall-attracting fire, with a semicircle of faces about it, is not to be\r\ndenied us. It is the _lar_ and genius of the meeting; the proof\r\npositive of the season; the representative of all our warm emotions\r\nand bright thoughts; the glorious eye of the room; the inciter to\r\nmirth, yet the retainer of order; the amalgamater of the age and sex;\r\nthe universal relish. Tastes may differ even on a mince-pie; but who\r\ngainsays a fire? The absence of other luxuries still leaves you in\r\npossession of that; but\r\n\r\n 'Who can hold a fire in his hand\r\n  With thinking on the frostiest twelfth-cake?'\r\n\r\n\"Let me have a dinner of some sort, no matter what, and then give me\r\nmy fire, and my friends, the humblest glass of wine, and a few\r\npenn'orths of chestnuts, and I will still make out my Christmas. What!\r\nHave we not Burgundy in our blood? Have we not joke, laughter,\r\nrepartee, bright eyes, comedies of other people, and comedies of our\r\nown; songs, memories, hopes? [An organ strikes up in the street at\r\nthis word, as if to answer me in the affirmative. Right thou old\r\nspirit of harmony, wandering about in that ark of thine, and touching\r\nthe public ear with sweetness and an abstraction! Let the multitude\r\nbustle on, but not unarrested by thee and by others, and not\r\nunreminded of the happiness of renewing a wise childhood.] As to our\r\nold friends the chestnuts, if anybody wants an excuse to his dignity\r\nfor roasting them, let him take the authority of Milton. 'Who now,'\r\nsays he lamenting the loss of his friend Deodati,--'who now will help\r\nto soothe my cares for me, and make the long night seem short with his\r\nconversation; while the roasting pear hisses tenderly on the fire, and\r\nthe nuts burst away with a noise,--\r\n\r\n 'And out of doors a washing storm o'erwhelms\r\n  Nature pitch-dark, and rides the thundering elms?'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS IN THE HIGHLANDS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFrom Grant's \"Popular Superstitions of the Highlands\" Hone gathered\r\nthe following account:--\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the brightening glow of the eastern sky warns the anxious\r\nhouse-maid of the approach of Christmas Day, she rises full of\r\nanxiety at the prospect of her morning labours. The meal, which was\r\nsteeped in the _sowans-bowie_ a fortnight ago, to make the\r\n_Prechdachdan sour_, or _sour scones_, is the first object of her\r\nattention. The gridiron is put on the fire, and the sour scones are\r\nsoon followed by hard cakes, soft cakes, buttered cakes, brandered\r\nbannocks, and pannich perm. The baking being once over, the sowans pot\r\nsucceeds the gridiron, full of new sowans, which are to be given to\r\nthe family, agreeably to custom, this day in their beds. The\r\nsowans are boiled into the consistence of molasses, when the\r\n_Lagan-le-vrich_, or yeast bread, to distinguish it from boiled\r\nsowans, is ready. It is then poured into as many bickers as there are\r\nindividuals to partake of it, and presently served to the whole, old\r\nand young. It would suit well the pen of a Burns, or the pencil of a\r\nHogarth, to paint the scene which follows. The ambrosial food is\r\ndespatched in aspiring draughts by the family, who soon give evident\r\nproofs of the enlivening effects of the _Lagan-le-vrich_. As soon as\r\neach despatches his bicker, he jumps out of bed--the elder branches to\r\nexamine the ominous signs of the day,[84] and the younger to enter on\r\nits amusements. Flocking to the swing, a favourite amusement on this\r\noccasion, the youngest of the family get the first '_shoulder_,' and\r\nthe next oldest in regular succession. In order to add the more to the\r\nspirit of the exercise, it is a common practice with the person in the\r\n_swing_, and the person appointed to swing him, to enter into a very\r\nwarm and humorous altercation. As the swinged person approaches the\r\nswinger, he exclaims, _Ei mi tu chal_, 'I'll eat your kail.' To this\r\nthe swinger replies, with a violent shove, _Cha ni u mu chal_, 'You\r\nshan't eat my kail.' These threats and repulses are sometimes carried\r\nto such a height, as to break down or capsize the threatener, which\r\ngenerally puts an end to the quarrel.\r\n\r\n\"As the day advances, those minor amusements are terminated at the\r\nreport of the gun, or the rattle of the ball clubs--the gun inviting\r\nthe marksman to the '_Kiavamuchd_,' or prize-shooting, and the latter\r\nto '_Luchd-vouil_,' or the ball combatants--both the principal sports\r\nof the day. Tired at length of the active amusements of the field,\r\nthey exchange them for the substantial entertainments of the table.\r\nGroaning under the '_sonsy haggis_,'[85] and many other savoury\r\ndainties, unseen for twelve months before, the relish communicated to\r\nthe company, by the appearance of the festive board, is more easily\r\nconceived than described. The dinner once despatched, the flowing bowl\r\nsucceeds, and the sparkling glass flies to and fro like a weaver's\r\nshuttle. As it continues its rounds, the spirits of the company become\r\nmore jovial and happy. Animated by its cheering influence, even old\r\ndecrepitude no longer feels his habitual pains--the fire of youth is\r\nin his eye, as he details to the company the exploits which\r\ndistinguished him in the days of '_auld langsyne_;' while the young,\r\nwith hearts inflamed with '_love and glory_,' long to mingle in the\r\nmore lively scenes of mirth, to display their prowess and agility.\r\nLeaving the patriarchs to finish those professions of friendship for\r\neach other, in which they are so devoutly engaged, the younger part of\r\nthe company will shape their course to the ball-room, or the\r\ncard-table, as their individual inclinations suggest; and the\r\nremainder of the evening is spent with the greatest pleasure of which\r\nhuman nature is susceptible.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSWORD DANCING AT CHRISTMAS.\r\n\r\nHone's \"Table Book\" (vol. i.), 1827, contains a letter descriptive of\r\nthe pitmen of Northumberland, which says:--\r\n\r\n\"The ancient custom of sword-dancing at Christmas is kept up in\r\nNorthumberland exclusively by these people. They may be constantly\r\nseen at that festive season with their fiddler, bands of swordsmen,\r\nTommy and Bessy, most grotesquely dressed, performing their annual\r\nroutine of warlike evolutions.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the present writer heard of similar festivities at Christmastide\r\nin the Madeley district of Shropshire, accompanied by grotesque\r\nimitations of the ancient hobby-horse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCUMBERLAND.\r\n\r\n\"A. W. R.,\" writing to Hone's \"Year Book,\" December 8,\r\n1827, says:--\r\n\r\n\"Nowhere does the Christmas season produce more heart-inspiring\r\nmirth than among the inhabitants of Cumberland.\r\n\r\n\"With Christmas Eve commences a regular series of 'festivities and\r\nmerry makings.' Night after night, if you want the farmer or his\r\nfamily, you must look for them anywhere but at home; and in the\r\ndifferent houses that you pass at one, two, or three in the morning,\r\nshould you happen to be out so late, you will find candles and fires\r\nstill unextinguished. At Christmas, every farmer gives two 'feasts,'\r\none called 't' ould foaks neet,' which is for those who are married,\r\nand the other 't' young foaks neet,' for those who are single. Suppose\r\nyou and I, sir, take the liberty of attending one of these feasts\r\nunasked (which by the bye is considered no liberty at all in\r\nCumberland) and see what is going on. Upon entering the room we behold\r\nseveral card parties, some at 'whist,' others at 'loo' (there called\r\n'lant'), or any other game that may suit their fancy. You will be\r\nsurprised on looking over the company to find that there is no\r\ndistinction of persons. Masters and servants, rich and poor, humble\r\nand lofty, all mingle together without restraint--all cares are\r\nforgotten--and each one seems to glory in his own enjoyment and in\r\nthat of his fellow-creatures. It is pleasant to find ourselves in such\r\nsociety, especially as it is rarely in one's life that such\r\nopportunities offer. Cast your eyes towards the sideboard, and there\r\nsee that large bowl of punch, which the good wife is inviting her\r\nguests to partake of, with apples, oranges, biscuits, and other\r\nagreeable eatables in plenty. The hospitable master welcomes us with a\r\nsmiling countenance and requests us to take seats and join one of the\r\ntables.\r\n\r\n\"In due time some one enters to tell the company that supper is\r\nwaiting in the next room. Thither we adjourn, and find the raised and\r\nmince pies, all sorts of tarts, and all cold--except the welcomes and\r\nentreaties--with cream, ale, &c., in abundance; in the midst of all a\r\nlarge goose pie, which seems to say 'Come and cut again.'\r\n\r\n\"After supper the party return to the card room, sit there for two or\r\nthree hours longer, and afterwards make the best of their way home, to\r\ntake a good long nap, and prepare for the same scene the next night.\r\nAt these 'feasts' intoxication is entirely out of the question--it\r\nnever happens.\r\n\r\n\"Such are the innocent amusements of these people.\"\r\n\r\n \"With gentle deeds and kindly thoughts,\r\n    And loving words withal,\r\n  Welcome the merry Christmas in\r\n    And hear a brother's call.\"[86]\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVISION FOR THE POOR ON CHRISTMAS DAY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GIVING AWAY OF CHRISTMAS DOLES.]\r\n\r\nBy the will of John Popple, dated the 12th of March, 1830, L4 yearly\r\nis to be paid unto the vicar, churchwardens, and overseers of the poor\r\nof the parish of Burnham, Buckinghamshire, to provide for the poor\r\npeople who should be residing in the poorhouse, a dinner, with a\r\nproper quantity of good ale and likewise with tobacco and snuff on\r\nChristmas Day.[87]\r\n\r\nThis kindly provision of Mr. Popple for the poor shows that he wished\r\nto keep up the good old Christmas customs which are so much admired by\r\nthe \"old man\" in Southey's \"The Old Mansion\" (a poem of this period).\r\nIn recalling the good doings at the mansion \"in my lady's time\" the\r\n\"old man\" says:--\r\n\r\n                        \"A woful day\r\n 'Twas for the poor when to her grave she went!\r\n\r\n          *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n                         Were they sick?\r\n  She had rare cordial waters, and for herbs\r\n  She could have taught the doctors. Then at winter,\r\n  When weekly she distributed the bread\r\n  In the poor old porch, to see her and to hear\r\n  The blessings on her! And I warrant them\r\n  They were a blessing to her when her wealth\r\n  Had been no comfort else. At Christmas, sir!\r\n  It would have warmed your heart if you had seen\r\n  Her Christmas kitchen; how the blazing fire\r\n  Made her fine pewter shine, and holly boughs\r\n  So cheerful red; and as for mistletoe,\r\n  The finest bough that grew in the country round\r\n  Was mark'd for madam. Then her old ale went\r\n  So bountiful about! a Christmas cask,--\r\n  And 'twas a noble one!--God help me, sir!\r\n  But I shall never see such days again.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROYAL CHRISTMASES\r\n\r\nIn the reigns of George IV. and William IV., though not kept with the\r\ngrandeur of earlier reigns, were observed with much rejoicing and\r\nfestivity, and the Royal Bounties to the poor of the metropolis and\r\nthe country districts surrounding Windsor and the other Royal Palaces\r\nwere dispensed with the customary generosity. In his \"Sketch Book,\"\r\nWashington Irving, who was born in the reign of George III. (1783),\r\nand lived on through the reigns of George IV., and William IV., and\r\nthe first two decades of the reign of Queen Victoria, gives delightful\r\ndescriptions of the\r\n\r\n\r\nFESTIVITIES OF THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY\r\n\r\nof the period, recalling the times when the old halls of castles and\r\nmanor houses resounded with the harp and the Christmas Carol and their\r\nample boards groaned under the weight of hospitality. He had travelled\r\na good deal on both sides of the Atlantic and he gives a picturesque\r\naccount of an old English stage coach journey \"on the day preceding\r\nChristmas.\" The coach was crowded with passengers. \"It was also loaded\r\nwith hampers of game, and baskets and boxes of delicacies; and hares\r\nhung dangling their long ears about the coachman's box, presents from\r\ndistant friends for the impending feast. I had three fine rosy-cheeked\r\nschoolboys for my fellow-passengers inside, full of the buxom health\r\nand manly spirit which I have observed in the children of this\r\ncountry. They were returning home for the holidays in high glee, and\r\npromising themselves a world of enjoyment. It was delightful to hear\r\nthe gigantic plans of the little rogues, and the impracticable feats\r\nthey were to perform during their six weeks' emancipation from the\r\nabhorred thraldom of book, birch, and pedagogue.\"\r\n\r\nThen follows Irving's graphic sketch of the English stage coachman,\r\nand the incidents of the journey, during which it seemed \"as if\r\neverybody was in good looks and good spirits.\r\n\r\n\"Game, poultry, and other luxuries of the table, were in brisk\r\ncirculation in the villages; the grocers,' butchers,' and fruiterers'\r\nshops were thronged with customers. The house-wives were stirring\r\nbriskly about, putting their dwellings in order; and the glossy\r\nbranches of holly, with their bright red berries, began to appear at\r\nthe windows.\"\r\n\r\n*     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\"In the evening we reached a village where I had determined to pass\r\nthe night. As we drove into the great gateway of the inn, I saw on one\r\nside the light of a rousing kitchen fire beaming through a window. I\r\nentered, and admired, for the hundredth time, that picture of\r\nconvenience, neatness, and broad, honest enjoyment, the kitchen of an\r\nEnglish inn. It was of spacious dimensions, hung round with copper and\r\ntin vessels highly polished, and decorated here and there with a\r\nChristmas green.... The scene completely realised poor Robin's [1684]\r\nhumble idea of the comforts of mid-winter:\r\n\r\n 'Now trees their leafy hats do bare\r\n  To reverence winter's silver hair;\r\n  A handsome hostess, merry host,\r\n  A pot of ale now and a toast,\r\n  Tobacco and a good coal fire,\r\n  Are things this season doth require.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Irving afterwards depicts, in his own graphic style, the Christmas\r\nfestivities observed at an old-fashioned English hall, and tells how\r\nthe generous squire pointed with pleasure to the indications of good\r\ncheer reeking from the chimneys of the comfortable farmhouses, and low\r\nthatched cottages. \"I love,\" said he, \"to see this day well kept by\r\nrich and poor; it is a great thing to have one day in the year, at\r\nleast, when you are sure of being welcome wherever you go, and of\r\nhaving, as it were, the world all thrown open to you; and I am almost\r\ndisposed to join with poor Robin, in his malediction on every churlish\r\nenemy to this honest festival:\r\n\r\n \"'Those who at Christmas do repine,\r\n     And would fain hence despatch him,\r\n   May they with old Duke Humphry dine,\r\n     Or else may Squire Ketch catch 'em.'\r\n\r\n\"The squire went on to lament the deplorable decay of the games and\r\namusements which were once prevalent at this season among the lower\r\norders, and countenanced by the higher; when the old halls of castles\r\nand manor-houses were thrown open at daylight; when the tables were\r\ncovered with brawn, and beef, and humming ale; when the harp and the\r\ncarol resounded all day long, and when rich and poor were alike\r\nwelcome to enter and make merry. 'Our old games and local customs,'\r\nsaid he, 'had a great effect in making the peasant fond of his home,\r\nand the promotion of them by the gentry made him fond of his lord.\r\nThey made the times merrier, and kinder and better; and I can truly\r\nsay with one of our old poets:\r\n\r\n \"'I like them well--the curious preciseness\r\n   And all-pretended gravity of those\r\n   That seek to banish hence these harmless sports,\r\n   Have thrust away much ancient honesty.'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTMASES OF QUEEN VICTORIA\r\n\r\nhave been kept with much bountifulness, but after the gracious manner\r\nof a Christian Queen who cares more for the welfare of her beloved\r\nsubjects than for ostentatious display. Her Majesty's Royal bounties\r\nto the poor of the metropolis and its environs, and also to others in\r\nthe country districts surrounding the several Royal Palaces are well\r\nknown, the ancient Christmas and New Year's gifts being dispensed with\r\ngreat generosity. The number of aged and afflicted persons usually\r\nrelieved by the Lord High Almoner in sums of 5s. and 13s. exceeds an\r\naggregate of 1,200. Then there is the distribution of the beef--a most\r\ninteresting feature of the Royal Bounty--which takes place in the\r\nRiding School at Windsor Castle, under the superintendence of the\r\nseveral Court officials. The meat, divided into portions of from three\r\npounds to seven pounds, and decorated with sprigs of holly, is\r\narranged upon a table placed in the middle of the Riding School, and\r\ncovered with white cloths from the Lord Steward's department of the\r\npalace. During the distribution the bells of St. John's Church ring a\r\nmerry peal. There are usually many hundreds of recipients and the\r\nweight of the beef allotted amounts to many thousands of pounds. Coals\r\nand clothing and other creature comforts are liberally dispensed,\r\naccording to the needs of the poor. In times of war and seasons of\r\ndistress hospitable entertainments, Christmas-trees, &c., are also\r\nprovided for the wives and children of soldiers and sailors on active\r\nservice; and in many other ways the Royal Bounty is extended to the\r\npoor and needy at Christmastide.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTMAS AT WINDSOR CASTLE, IN 1841,\r\n\r\nis thus referred to in the \"Life of the Prince Consort\" (by Theodore\r\nMartin):--\r\n\r\n\"When Christmas came round with its pleasant festivities and its\r\nshining Christmas-trees, it had within it a new source of delight for\r\nthe Royal parents. 'To think,' says the Queen's 'Journal,' 'that we\r\nhave two children now, and one who enjoys the sight already, is like a\r\ndream!' And in writing to his father the Prince expresses the same\r\nfeeling. 'This,' he says, 'is the dear Christmas Eve, on which I have\r\nso often listened with impatience for your step, which was to usher us\r\ninto the present-room. To-day I have two children of my own to give\r\npresents to, who, they know not why, are full of happy wonder at the\r\nGerman Christmas-tree and its radiant candles.'\r\n\r\n\"The coming year was danced into in good old English fashion. In the\r\nmiddle of the dance, as the clock finished striking twelve, a flourish\r\nof trumpets was blown, in accordance with a German custom. This, the\r\nQueen's 'Journal' records, 'had a fine solemn effect, and quite\r\naffected dear Albert, who turned pale, and had tears in his eyes, and\r\npressed my hand very warmly. It touched me too, for I felt that he\r\nmust think of his dear native country, which he has left for me.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS AT OSBORNE.\r\n\r\nWriting from Cowes, on Christmas Eve, in reference to the Christmas\r\nfestivities at Osborne in the last decade of the nineteenth century, a\r\ncorrespondent says:--\r\n\r\n\"After transacting business the Queen drove out this afternoon,\r\nreturning to Osborne just as the setting sun illumines with its rosy\r\nrays the Paladin Towers of her Majesty's marine residence. The Queen\r\ndesires to live, as far as the cares of State permit, the life of a\r\nprivate lady. Her Majesty loves the seclusion of this lordly estate,\r\nand here at Christmas time she enjoys the society of her children and\r\ngrandchildren, who meet together as less exalted families do at this\r\nmerry season to reciprocate the same homely delights as those which\r\nare experienced throughout the land.\r\n\r\n\"This afternoon a pleasant little festivity has been celebrated at\r\nOsborne House, where her Majesty, with an ever-kindly interest in her\r\nservants and dependants, has for many years inaugurated Christmas in a\r\nsimilar way, the children of her tenantry and the old and infirm\r\nenjoying by the Royal bounty the first taste of Christmas fare. The\r\nOsborne estate now comprises 5,000 acres, and it includes the Prince\r\nConsort's model farm. The children of the labourers--who are housed in\r\nexcellent cottages--attend the Whippingham National Schools, a pretty\r\nblock of buildings, distant one mile from Osborne. About half the\r\nnumber of scholars live upon the Queen's estate, and, in accordance\r\nwith annual custom, the mistresses of the schools, the Misses Thomas,\r\naccompanied by the staff of teachers, have conducted a little band of\r\nboys and girls--fifty-four in all--to the house, there to take tea and\r\nto receive the customary Christmas gifts. Until very recently the\r\nQueen herself presided at the distribution; but the Princess Beatrice\r\nhas lately relieved her mother of the fatigue involved; for the\r\nceremony is no mere formality, it is made the occasion of many a\r\nkindly word the remembrance of which far outlasts the gifts. All sorts\r\nof rumours are current on the estate for weeks before this Christmas\r\nEve gathering as to the nature of the presents to be bestowed, for no\r\none is supposed to know beforehand what they will be; but there was a\r\npretty shrewd guess to-day that the boys would be given gloves, and\r\nthe girls cloaks. In some cases the former had had scarves or cloth\r\nfor suits, and the latter dresses or shawls. Whatever the Christmas\r\npresents may be, here they are, arranged upon tables in two long\r\nlines, in the servants' hall. To this holly-decorated apartment the\r\nexpectant youngsters are brought, and their delighted gaze falls upon\r\na huge Christmas-tree laden with beautiful toys. Everybody knows that\r\nthe tree will be there, and moreover that its summit will be crowned\r\nwith a splendid doll. Now, the ultimate ownership of this doll is a\r\nmatter of much concern; it needs deliberation, as it is awarded to the\r\nbest child, and the judges are the children themselves. The trophy is\r\nhanded to the keeping of Miss Thomas, and on the next 1st of May the\r\nchildren select by their votes the most popular girl in the school to\r\nbe elected May Queen. To her the gift goes, and no fairer way could be\r\ndevised. The Princess Beatrice always makes a point of knowing to whom\r\nthe prize has been awarded. Her Royal Highness is so constantly a\r\nvisitor to the cottagers and to the school that she has many an\r\ninquiry to make of the little ones as they come forward to receive\r\ntheir gifts.\r\n\r\n\"The girls are called up first by the mistress, and Mr. Andrew Blake,\r\nthe steward, introduces each child to the Princess Beatrice, to whom\r\nMr. Blake hands the presents that her Royal Highness may bestow them\r\nupon the recipients with a word of good will, which makes the day\r\nmemorable. Then the boys are summoned to participate in the\r\ndistribution of good things, which, it should be explained, consist\r\nnot only of seasonable and sensible clothing, but toys from the tree,\r\npresented by the Queen's grandchildren, who, with their parents, grace\r\nthe ceremony with their presence and make the occasion one of family\r\ninterest. The Ladies-in-Waiting also attend. Each boy and girl gets in\r\naddition a nicely-bound story-book and a large slice of plum pudding\r\nneatly packed in paper, and if any little one is sick at home its\r\nportion is carefully reserved. But the hospitality of the Queen is not\r\nlimited to the children. On alternate years the old men and women\r\nresident on the estate are given, under the same pleasant auspices,\r\npresents of blankets or clothing. To-day it was the turn of the men,\r\nand they received tweed for suits. The aged people have their pudding\r\nas well. For the farm labourers and boys, who are not bidden to this\r\nentertainment, there is a distribution of tickets, each representing a\r\ngoodly joint of beef for the Christmas dinner. The festivity this\r\nafternoon was brought to a close by the children singing the National\r\nAnthem in the courtyard.\r\n\r\n\"The Queen is accustomed to spend Christmas Day very quietly,\r\nattending service at the Chapel at Osborne in the morning, and in the\r\nevening the Royal family meeting at dinner. There are Christmas trees\r\nfor the children, and for the servants too, but the houshold reserves\r\nits principal festivity for the New Year--a day which is specially set\r\naside for their entertainment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTMAS FESTIVITIES AT SANDRINGHAM\r\n\r\nare observed with generous hospitality by their Royal Highnesses the\r\nPrince and Princess of Wales, who take special interest in the\r\nenjoyment of their tenants, and also remember the poor. A\r\ntime-honoured custom on Christmas Eve is the distribution of prime\r\njoints of meat to the labourers employed on the Royal estate, and to\r\nthe poor of the five parishes of Sandringham, West Newton, Babingley,\r\nDersingham, and Wolferton. From twelve to fifteen hundred pounds of\r\nmeat are usually distributed, and such other gifts are made as the\r\ninclemency of the season and the necessities of the poor require. In\r\nSandringham \"Past and Present,\" 1888, Mrs. Herbert Jones\r\nsays:--\"Sandringham, which is the centre of a generous hospitality,\r\nhas not only been in every way raised, benefited, and enriched since\r\nit passed into the royal hands, which may be said to have created it\r\nafresh, but rests under the happy glow shed over it by the preference\r\nof a princess\r\n\r\n \"'Whose peerless feature joined with her birth,\r\n   Approve her fit for none but for a king.'\r\n                         Shakespeare's _Henry VI_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Christmas Generosity of the late Duke of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to the press a lieutenant of Marines makes the following\r\nreference to a Christmas entertainment given by H.R.H. the Duke of\r\nEdinburgh, in 1886: \"Last night a large party, consisting of many\r\nofficers of the Fleet, including all the 'old ships' of the Duke, and\r\nthree or four midshipmen from every ship in the Fleet, were invited to\r\na Christmas-tree at S. Antonio Palace. In the course of the evening\r\ntwo lotteries were drawn, all the numbers being prizes, each guest\r\nconsequently getting two. I have had an opportunity of seeing many of\r\nthese, and they are all most beautiful and useful objects, ranging in\r\nvalue from five shillings to perhaps three or four pounds. I should\r\nthink that at least half the prizes I have seen were worth over one\r\npound.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER SEASONABLE HOSPITALITY AND BENEVOLENCE.\r\n\r\nThe good example set by royalty is followed throughout the land.\r\nFriendly hospitalities are general at Christmastide, and in London and\r\nother large centres of population many thousands of poor people are\r\nprovided with free breakfasts, dinners, teas, and suppers on Christmas\r\nDay, public halls and school-rooms being utilised for purposes of\r\nentertainment; children in hospitals are plentifully supplied with\r\ntoys, and Christmas parties are also given to the poor at the private\r\nresidences of benevolent people. As an illustrative instance of\r\ngenerous Christmas hospitality by a landowner we cite the following:--\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS DINNER TO FIVE THOUSAND POOR.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Eve, 1887, Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, Bart., the largest\r\nlandowner in the Principality of Wales, gave his annual Christmas\r\ngifts to the aged and deserving poor throughout the extensive mining\r\ndistricts of Ruabon, Rhosllanerchrugog, Cern, and Rhosymedre,\r\nDenbighshire, where much distress prevailed in consequence of the\r\ndepression in trade. Several fine oxen were slain in Wynnstay Park,\r\nand the beef was distributed in pieces ranging from 4lb. to 7lb.,\r\naccording to the number of members in each family. A Christmas dinner\r\nwas thus provided for upwards of 5,000 persons. In addition to this,\r\nLady Williams Wynn provided thousands of yards of flannel and cloth\r\nfor clothing, together with a large number of blankets, the aged men\r\nand women also receiving a shilling with the gift. The hon. baronet\r\nhad also erected an elaborate spacious hospital to the memory of his\r\nuncle, the late Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, M.P., and presented it to\r\nthe parish.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTIONS OF CHRISTMAS FARE TO THE POOR\r\n\r\nare liberally made from various centres in different parts of London,\r\nand thus many thousands of those who have fallen below the poverty\r\nline share in the festivities of Christmastide.\r\n\r\nThis illustration of Christian caterers dispensing creature comforts\r\nto the poor children may be taken as representative of many such\r\nChristmas scenes in the metropolis. For over forty years the St.\r\nGiles' Christian Mission, now under the superintendence of Mr. W. M.\r\nWheatley, has been exercising a beneficial influence among the needy\r\npoor, and, it is stated, that at least 104,000 people have through\r\nthis Mission been enabled to make a fresh start in life. Many other\r\nChurch Missions are doing similar work. In addition to treats to poor\r\nchildren and aged people at Christmastide, there are also great\r\ndistributions of Christmas fare:--Joints of roasting meat,\r\nplum-puddings, cakes, groceries, warm clothing, toys, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POOR CHILDREN'S TREAT IN MODERN TIMES.]\r\n\r\nAt a recent distribution of a Christmas charity at Millbrook,\r\nSouthampton, the Rev. A. C. Blunt stated that one of the recipients\r\nhad nearly reached her 102nd year. She was born in Hampshire, and down\r\nto a very recent period had been able to do needlework.\r\n\r\nIn many cities and towns Christmas gifts are distributed on St.\r\nThomas's Day, and as an example we cite the Brighton distribution in\r\n1886, on which occasion the Brighton Police Court was filled by a\r\ncongregation of some of the \"oldest inhabitants.\" And there was a\r\ndistribution from the magistrates poor-box of a Christmas gift of half\r\na sovereign to 150 of the aged poor whose claims to the bounty had\r\nbeen inquired into by the police. Formerly 100 used to be cheered in\r\nthis way, but the contributions to the box this year enabled a wider\r\ncircle to share in the dole. There was a wonderful collection of old\r\npeople, for the average age was over 83 years. The oldest was a\r\nvenerable widow, who confessed to being 96 years old, the next was\r\nanother lady of 94 years, and then came two old fellows who had each\r\nattained 93 years. Many of the recipients were too infirm to appear,\r\nbut the oldest of them all, the lady of 96 came into court despite the\r\nsharpness of the wind and the frozen roads.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTMAS AT BELVOIR CASTLE,\r\n\r\nkept with generous liberality by the Duke of Rutland, in 1883, may be\r\ncited as an example of Christmas customs continued by the head of a\r\nnoble house:\r\n\r\n\"The usual Christmas gifts were given to the poor of Knipton,\r\nWoolsthorpe, and Redmile--nearly two hundred in number--consisting of\r\ncalico, flannel dresses, stockings, and handkerchiefs, each person at\r\nthe same time receiving a loaf of bread and a pint of ale. Twenty-one\r\nbales of goods, containing counterpanes, blankets, and sheets, were\r\nalso sent to the clergy of as many different villages for distribution\r\namongst the poor. The servants at the Castle and workmen of the\r\nestablishment had their Christmas dinner, tea, and supper, the servants'\r\nhall having been beautifully decorated. At one end of the room was a\r\ncoronet, with the letter 'R'; and at the opposite end three coronets,\r\nwith the 'peacock in pride,' being the crest of the Rutland family.\r\nThe following mottoes, in large letters, were conspicuous, 'Long live\r\nthe Duke of Rutland,' 'Long live Lord and Lady John Manners and\r\nfamily,' and 'A Merry Christmas to you all.' These were enclosed in a\r\nneat border. From the top of the room were suspended long festoons of\r\nlinked ribbons of red, white, blue, and orange. All present thoroughly\r\nenjoyed themselves, as it was the wish of his Grace they should do.\"\r\n\r\nSimilar hospitalities are dispensed by other noblemen and gentlemen in\r\ndifferent parts of the country at Christmas.\r\n\r\n*     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe lordly hospitality of Lincolnshire is depicted in\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE BARON'S YULE FEAST:\r\n\r\nA Christmas Rhyme; by Thomas Cooper, the Chartist\" (1846); which is\r\ninscribed to the Countess of Blessington, and in the advertisement the\r\nauthor offers \"but one apology for the production of a metrical essay,\r\ncomposed chiefly of imperfect and immature pieces: The ambition to\r\ncontribute towards the fund of Christmas entertainment.\" The scene of\r\nthe Baron's Yule Feast is depicted in Torksey's Hall, Torksey being\r\none of the first towns in Lincolnshire in the Saxon period. After some\r\nintroductory verses the writer says:\r\n\r\n \"It is the season when our sires\r\n    Kept jocund holiday;\r\n  And, now, around our charier fires,\r\n    Old Yule shall have a lay:--\r\n  A prison-bard is once more free;\r\n  And, ere he yields his voice to thee,\r\n  His song a merry-song shall be!\r\n\r\n  Sir Wilfrid de Thorold freely holds\r\n    What his stout sires held before--\r\n  Broad lands for plough and fruitful folds,--\r\n    Though by gold he sets no store;\r\n  And he saith, from fen and woodland wolds\r\n    From marish, heath, and moor,--\r\n      To feast in his hall\r\n      Both free and thrall,\r\n    Shall come as they came of yore.\r\n\r\n  *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n  Now merrily ring the lady-bells\r\n    Of the nunnery by the Fosse:--\r\n  Say the hinds their silver music swells\r\n  'Like the blessed angels' syllables,\r\n    At His birth who bore the cross.'\r\n\r\n  And solemnly swells Saint Leonard's chime\r\n    And the great bell loud and deep:--\r\n  Say the gossips, 'Let's talk of the holy time\r\n    When the shepherds watched their sheep;\r\n  And the Babe was born for all souls' crime\r\n    In the weakness of flesh to weep.'--\r\n  But, anon, shrills the pipe of the merry mime\r\n    And their simple hearts upleap.\r\n\r\n  'God save your souls, good Christian folk!\r\n    God save your souls from sin!--\r\n  Blythe Yule is come--let us blythely joke!'--\r\n    Cry the mummers ere they begin.\r\n\r\n  Then, plough-boy Jack, in kirtle gay,--\r\n    Though shod with clouted shoon,--\r\n  Stands forth the wilful maid to play\r\n  Who ever saith to her lover, 'Nay'--\r\n    When he sues for a lover's boon.\r\n\r\n  While Hob the smith with sturdy arm\r\n    Circleth the feigned maid;\r\n  And, spite of Jack's assumed alarm,\r\n  Busseth his lips, like a lover warm,\r\n    And will not 'Nay' be said\r\n\r\n  Then loffe the gossips, as if wit\r\n    Were mingled with the joke:\r\n  Gentles,--they were with folly smit,--\r\n  Natheless, their memories acquit\r\n    Of crime--these simple folk!\r\n\r\n  No harmful thoughts their revels blight,--\r\n  Devoid of bitter hate and spite,\r\n    They hold their merriment;--\r\n  And, till the chimes tell noon at night,\r\n    Their joy shall be unspent!\r\n\r\n  Come haste ye to bold Thorold's hall,\r\n    And crowd his kitchen wide;\r\n  For there, he saith, both free and thrall\r\n    Shall sport this good Yule-tide.\"\r\n\r\nIn subsequent verses the writer depicts the bringing in of the yule\r\nlog to the Baron's Hall,\r\n\r\n            \"Where its brave old heart\r\n            A glow shall impart\r\n  To the heart of each guest at the festival.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n  They pile the Yule-log on the hearth,--\r\n    Soak toasted crabs in ale;\r\n  And while they sip, their homely mirth\r\n  Is joyous as if all the earth\r\n    For man were void of bale!\r\n\r\n  And why should fears for future years,\r\n  Mix jolly ale with thoughts of tears\r\n    When in the horn 'tis poured?\r\n  And why should ghost of sorrow fright\r\n  The bold heart of an English knight\r\n    When beef is on the board?\r\n\r\n  De Thorold's guests are wiser than\r\n    The men of mopish lore;\r\n  For round they push the smiling can\r\n    And slice the plattered store.\r\n\r\n  And round they thrust the ponderous cheese,\r\n    And the loaves of wheat and rye;\r\n  None stinteth him for lack of ease--\r\n  For each a stintless welcome sees\r\n    In the Baron's blythesome eye.\r\n\r\n  The Baron joineth the joyous feast--\r\n    But not in pomp or pride;\r\n  He smileth on the humblest guest\r\n  So gladsomely--all feel that rest\r\n    Of heart which doth abide\r\n  Where deeds of generousness attest\r\n  The welcome of the tongue professed\r\n    Is not within belied.\"\r\n\r\n*     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nIn subsequent verses a stranger minstrel appears on the festive scene,\r\nand tells his tale of love in song, acquitting himself\r\n\r\n \"So rare and gentle, that the hall\r\n  Rings with applause which one and all\r\n  Render who share the festival.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSome of the poets of this period have dealt playfully with the\r\nfestivities of Christmastide, as, for example, Laman Blanchard (1845)\r\nin the following effusion:--\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS CHIT-CHAT.\r\n\r\nIn a Large Family Circle.\r\n\r\n  \"The day of all days we have seen\r\n  Is Christmas,\" said Sue to Eugene;\r\n  \"More welcome in village and city\r\n  Than Mayday,\" said Andrew to Kitty.\r\n  \"Why 'Mistletoe's' twenty times sweeter\r\n  Than 'May,'\" said Matilda to Peter;\r\n  \"And so you will find it, if I'm a\r\n  True prophet,\" said James to Jemima.\r\n  \"I'll stay up to supper, no bed,\"\r\n  Then lisped little Laura to Ned.\r\n  \"The girls all good-natured and dressy,\r\n  And bright-cheeked,\" said Arthur to Jessie;\r\n  \"Yes, hoping ere next year to marry,\r\n  The madcaps!\" said Charlotte to Harry.\r\n  \"So steaming, so savoury, so juicy,\r\n  The feast,\" said fat Charley to Lucy.\r\n  \"Quadrilles and Charades might come on\r\n  Before dinner,\" said Martha to John.\r\n  \"You'll find the roast beef when you're dizzy,\r\n  A settler,\" said Walter to Lizzy.\r\n  \"Oh, horrid! one wing of a wren,\r\n  With a pea,\" said Belinda to Ben.\r\n  \"Sublime!\" said--displaying his leg--\r\n  George Frederick Augustus to Peg.\r\n  \"At Christmas refinement is all fuss\r\n  And nonsense,\" said Fan to Adolphus.\r\n  \"Would romps--or a tale of a fairy--\r\n  Best suit you,\" said Robert to Mary.\r\n  \"At stories that work ghost and witch hard,\r\n  I tremble,\" said Rosa to Richard.\r\n  \"A ghostly hair-standing dilemma\r\n  Needs 'bishop,'\" said Alfred to Emma;\r\n  \"What fun when with fear a stout crony\r\n  Turns pale,\" said Maria to Tony;\r\n  \"And Hector, unable to rally,\r\n  Runs screaming,\" said Jacob to Sally.\r\n  \"While you and I dance in the dark\r\n  The polka,\" said Ruth unto Mark:\r\n  \"Each catching, according to fancy,\r\n  His neighbour,\" said wild Tom to Nancy;\r\n  \"Till candles, to show what we can do,\r\n  Are brought in,\" said Ann to Orlando;\r\n  \"And then we all laugh what is truly a\r\n  Heart's laugh,\" said William to Julia.\r\n  \"Then

Shabby!\" said Soph to Theophilus;\r\n  \"To meet again under the holly,\r\n  _Et cetera_,\" said Paul to fair Polly.\r\n  \"Dear Uncle, has ordered his chariot;\r\n  All's over,\" said Matthew to Harriet.\r\n  \"And pray now be all going to bedward,\"\r\n  Said kind Aunt Rebecca to Edward!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS EVE, 1849,\r\n\r\nis the time of Robert Browning's beautiful poem of \"Christmas Eve and\r\nEaster Day,\" in which the poet sings the song of man's immortality,\r\nproclaiming, as Easter Day breaks and Christ rises, that\r\n\r\n  \"Mercy every way is infinite.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnd, in his beautiful poem of \"In Memoriam,\" Lord Tennyson\r\nassociates some of his finest verses with the ringing of\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTMAS BELLS.\r\n\r\n \"Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky,\r\n    The flying cloud, the frosty light:\r\n    The year is dying in the night;\r\n  Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.\r\n\r\n  Ring out the old, ring in the new,\r\n    Ring, happy bells, across the snow:\r\n    The year is going, let him go;\r\n  Ring out the false, ring in the true.\r\n\r\n  *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n  Ring out old shapes of foul disease;\r\n    Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;\r\n    Ring out the thousand wars of old,\r\n  Ring in the thousand years of peace.\r\n\r\n  Ring in the valiant man and free,\r\n    The larger heart, the kindlier hand;\r\n    Ring out the darkness of the land,\r\n  Ring in the Christ that is to be.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHRISTMAS BELLS.]\r\n\r\nAs the poet Longfellow stood on the lofty tower of Bruges\r\nCathedral the belfry chimes set him musing, and of those\r\nchimes he says:\r\n\r\n  \"Then most musical and solemn, bringing back the olden times,\r\n  With their strange, unearthly changes, rang the melancholy chimes,\r\n  Like the psalms from some old cloister, when the nuns sing in the\r\n    choir;\r\n  And the great bell tolled among them, like the chanting of a friar.\r\n  Visions of the days departed, shadowy phantoms filled my brain:\r\n  They who live in history only seemed to walk the earth again.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR CARDS\r\n\r\nwere first circulated in England in 1846. That year not more than a\r\nthousand copies were printed, and that was considered a large sale.\r\nThe numbers distributed annually soon increased to tens and hundreds\r\nof thousands, and now there are millions of them. Mr. J. C. Horsley,\r\na member of the Royal Academy, designed this first card which\r\nwas sent out in 1846. It represents a family party of three\r\ngenerations--grandfather and grandmother, father and mother, and\r\nlittle children--and all are supposed to be joining in the sentiment,\r\n\"A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you.\" The card was issued\r\nfrom the office of one of the periodicals of the time, _Felix\r\nSummerley's Home Treasury_. It was first lithographed, and then it was\r\ncoloured by hand.\r\n\r\nChristmas and New Year Cards became very popular in the decade\r\n1870-1880. But then, however, simple cards alone did not suffice. Like\r\nmany other things, they felt the influence of the latter-day\r\n_renaissance_ of art, and by a sort of evolutionary process developed\r\ncards monochrome and coloured, \"Christmas Bell\" cards, palettes,\r\nscrolls, circular and oval panels, stars, fans, crescents, and other\r\nshaped novelties; embossed cards, the iridescent series, the rustic\r\nand frosted cards, the folding series, the jewel cards, the crayons,\r\nand private cards on which the sender's name and sentiments are\r\nprinted in gold, silver, or colours; hand-painted cards with\r\nlandscapes, seascapes, and floral decorations; paintings on porcelain;\r\nsatin cards, fringed silk, plush, Broche, and other artistically\r\nmade-up novelties; \"art-gem\" panels; elaborate booklets, and other\r\nelegant souvenirs of the festive season. Many of the Christmas\r\nbooklets are beautifully illustrated editions of popular poems and\r\ncarols.\r\n\r\n\"Quartette\" cards, \"Snap\" cards, and other cards of games for the\r\ndiversion of social gatherings are also extensively used at\r\nChristmastide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSTIC CHRISTMAS MASQUE.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a wish expressed by the Lady Londesborough, a\r\nMasque, entitled, \"Recollections of Old Christmas,\" was performed at\r\nGrimston at Christmas, 1850, the following prologue being contributed\r\nby Barry Cornwall:--\r\n\r\n \"When winter nights grow long,\r\n   And winds without blow cold,\r\n  We sit in a ring round the warm wood-fire,\r\n   And listen to stories old!\r\n  And we try to look grave (as maids should be),\r\n  When the men bring in boughs of the laurel tree.\r\n      O the laurel, the evergreen tree!\r\n      The poets have laurels--and why not we?\r\n\r\n  How pleasant when night falls down,\r\n   And hides the wintry sun,\r\n  To see them come in to the blazing fire,\r\n   And know that their work is done;\r\n  Whilst many bring in, with a laugh or rhyme,\r\n  Green branches of holly for Christmas time!\r\n      O the holly, the bright green holly!\r\n      It tells (like a tongue) that the times are jolly!\r\n\r\n  Sometimes--(in _our_ grave house\r\n    Observe this happeneth not;)\r\n  But at times, the evergreen laurel boughs,\r\n    And the holly are all forgot!\r\n  And then! what then? Why the men laugh low,\r\n  And hang up a branch of--the misletoe!\r\n      Oh, brave is the laurel! and brave is the holly!\r\n      But the misletoe banisheth melancholy!\r\n  Ah, nobody knows, nor ever _shall_ know,\r\n  What is done under the misletoe!\"\r\n\r\nA printed copy of the Masque, which bears date, \"Tuesday, XXIV\r\nDecember, MDCCCL.,\" is preserved in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"CHARACTERS\r\n\r\n(Which speak)\r\n\r\n\"Old Father Christmas         Hon.

Thomas Hood's \"Haunted House,\" S. T.\r\nColeridge's \"Ancient Mariner,\" and some other weird works of poetry\r\nhave also been found serviceable in producing that strange chill of\r\nthe blood, that creeping kind of feeling all over you, which is one of\r\nthe enjoyments of Christmastide. Coleridge (says the late Mr. George\r\nDawson)[88] \"holds the first place amongst English poets in this\r\nobjective teaching of the vague, the mystic, the dreamy, and the\r\nimaginative. I defy any man of imagination or sensibility to have\r\n'The Ancient Mariner' read to him, by the flickering firelight on\r\nChristmas night, by a master mind possessed by the mystic spirit of\r\nthe poem, and not find himself taken away from the good regions of\r\n'ability to account for,' and taken into some far-off dreamland, and\r\nmade even to start at his own footfall, and almost to shudder at his\r\nown shadow. You shall sit round the fire at Christmas time, good men\r\nand true every one of you; you shall come there armed with your patent\r\nphilosophy; that creak you have heard, it is only the door--the list\r\nis not carefully put round the door, and it is the wintry wind that\r\nwhistles through the crevices. Ghosts and spectres belong to the olden\r\ntimes; science has waved its wand and laid them all. We have no\r\nsuperstition about us; we walk enlightened nineteenth-century men; it\r\nis quite beneath us to be superstitious. By and bye, one begins to\r\ntell tales of ghosts and spirits; and another begins, and it goes all\r\nround; and there comes over you a curious feeling--a very\r\nunphilosophical feeling, in fact, because the pulsations of air from\r\nthe tongue of the storyteller ought not to bring over you that\r\npeculiar feeling. You have only heard words, tales--confessedly by the\r\nstoryteller himself only tales, such as may figure in the next monthly\r\nmagazine for pure entertainment and amusement. But why do you feel so,\r\nthen? If you say that these things are mere hallucinations, vague\r\nair-beating or tale-telling, why, good philosopher, do you feel so\r\ncurious, so all-overish, as it were? Again, you are a man without the\r\nleast terror in you, as brave and bold a man as ever stepped: living\r\nman cannot frighten you, and verily the dead rise not with you. But\r\nyou are brought, towards midnight, to the stile over which is gained a\r\nview of the village churchyard, where sleep the dead in quietness.\r\nYour manhood begins just to ooze away a little; you are caught\r\noccasionally whistling to keep your courage up; you do not expect to\r\nsee a ghost, but you are ready to see one, or to make one.\" At such a\r\nmoment, think of the scene depicted by Coleridge:--\r\n\r\n\"'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high;\r\n  The dead men stood together.\r\n\r\n  All stood together on the deck,\r\n    For a charnel-dungeon fitter:\r\n  All fixed on me their stony eyes,\r\n    That in the moon did glitter.\r\n\r\n  The pang, the curse, with which they died,\r\n    Had never passed away:\r\n  I could not draw my eyes from theirs,\r\n    Nor turn them up to pray.\"\r\n\r\nWith this weird tale in his mind in the mystic stillness of midnight\r\nwould an imaginative man be likely to deny the reality of the spirit\r\nworld? The chances are that he would be spellbound; or, if he had\r\nbreath enough, would cry out--\r\n\r\n  \"Angels and ministers of grace, defend us!\"\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1421, the widow of Ralph Cranbourne, of Dipmore End, in\r\nthe parish of Sandhurst, Berks, was one midnight alarmed by a noise in\r\nher bedchamber, and, looking up, she saw at her bedfoot the appearance\r\nof a skeleton (which she verily believed was her husband) nodding and\r\ntalking to her upon its fingers, or finger bones, after the manner of\r\na dumb person. Whereupon she was so terrified, that after striving to\r\nscream aloud, which she could not, for her tongue clave to her mouth,\r\nshe fell backward as in a swoon; yet not so insensible withal but she\r\ncould see that at this the figure became greatly agitated and\r\ndistressed, and would have clasped her, but upon her appearance of\r\nloathing it desisted, only moving its jaw upward and downward, as if\r\nit would cry for help but could not for want of its parts of speech.\r\nAt length, she growing more and more faint, and likely to die of fear,\r\nthe spectre suddenly, as if at a thought, began to swing round its\r\nhand, which was loose at the wrist, with a brisk motion, and the\r\nfinger bones being long and hard, and striking sharply against each\r\nother, made a loud noise like to the springing of a watchman's rattle.\r\nAt which alarm, the neighbours running in, stoutly armed, as against\r\nthieves or murderers, the spectre suddenly departed.\"[89]\r\n\r\n \"His shoes they were coffins, his dim eye reveal'd\r\n    The gleam of a grave-lamp with vapours oppress'd;\r\n  And a dark crimson necklace of blood-drops congeal'd\r\n    Reflected each bone that jagg'd out of his breast.\"[90]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nWELCOME TO CHRISTMAS.\r\n\r\nBy MARY HOWITT.\r\n\r\n  He comes--the brave old Christmas!\r\n    His sturdy steps I hear;\r\n  We will give him a hearty welcome,\r\n    For he comes but once a year!\r\n\r\n  And of all our old acquaintance\r\n    'Tis he we like the best;\r\n  There's a jolly old way about him--\r\n    There's a warm heart in his breast.\r\n\r\n  He is not too proud to enter\r\n    Your house though it be mean;\r\n  Yet is company fit for a courtier,\r\n    And is welcomed by the Queen!\r\n\r\n  He can tell you a hundred stories\r\n    Of the Old World's whims and ways,\r\n  And how they merrily wish'd him joy\r\n    In our fathers' courting days.\r\n\r\n  He laughs with the heartiest laughter\r\n    That does one good to hear;\r\n  'Tis a pity so brave an old fellow\r\n    Should come but once a year!\r\n\r\n  But once, then, let us be ready,\r\n    With all that he can desire--\r\n  With plenty of holly and ivy,\r\n    And a huge log for the fire;\r\n\r\n  With plenty of noble actions,\r\n    And plenty of warm good-will;\r\n  With our hearts as full of kindness\r\n    As the board we mean to fill.\r\n\r\n  With plenty of store in the larder,\r\n    And plenty of wine in the bin;\r\n  And plenty of mirth for the kitchen;\r\n    Then open and let him in!\r\n\r\n  Oh, he is a fine old fellow--\r\n    His heart's in the truest place;\r\n  You may know that at once by the children,\r\n    Who glory to see his face.\r\n\r\n  For he never forgets the children,\r\n    They all are dear to him;\r\n  You'll see that with wonderful presents\r\n    His pockets are cramm'd to the brim.\r\n\r\n  Nor will he forget the servants,\r\n    Whether you've many or one;\r\n  Nor the poor old man at the corner;\r\n    Nor the widow who lives alone.\r\n\r\n  He is rich as a Jew, is Old Christmas,\r\n    I wish he would make me his heir;\r\n  But he has plenty to do with his money,\r\n    And he is not given to spare.\r\n\r\n  Not he--bless the good old fellow!\r\n    He hates to hoard his pelf;\r\n  He wishes to make all people\r\n    As gay as he is himself.\r\n\r\n  So he goes to the parish unions--\r\n    North, south, and west and east--\r\n  And there he gives the paupers,\r\n    At his own expense a feast.\r\n\r\n  He gives the old men tobacco,\r\n    And the women a cup of tea;\r\n  And he takes the pauper children,\r\n    And dances them on his knee.\r\n\r\n  I wish you could see those paupers\r\n    Sit down to his noble cheer,\r\n  You would wish, like them, and no wonder,\r\n    That he stay'd the livelong year.\r\n\r\n  Yes, he is the best old fellow\r\n    That ever on earth you met;\r\n  And he gave us a boon when first he came\r\n    Which we can never forget.\r\n\r\n  So we will give him a welcome\r\n    Shall gladden his old heart's core!\r\n  And let us in good and gracious deeds\r\n    Resemble him more and more!\r\n\r\n_December 21, 1850._\r\n\r\n\r\nWASSAILING THE APPLE-TREES.\r\n\r\nWriting on this subject, in the _Antiquary_, March, 1895, Mr. Harry\r\nHems, of Exeter, introduces the reduced copy of an illustration which\r\nappears on the following page, and which he states was published in\r\nthe _Illustrated London News_, January 11, 1851.\r\n\r\nThe picture (says Mr. Hems) \"presents, as will be seen, a frosty,\r\nmoonlight night, with a brilliantly-lit old farmhouse in the\r\nbackground. In the fore are leafless fruit-trees, and three men firing\r\nguns at them, whilst the jovial farmer and another man drink success\r\nto the year's crop from glasses evidently filled from a jug of cider,\r\nwhich the latter also holds a-high. A crowd of peasants--men, women\r\nand children--are gathered around, and the following description is\r\nappended:--\r\n\r\n\"'Amongst the scenes of jocund hospitality in this holiday season,\r\nthat are handed down to us, is one which not only presents an\r\nenlivening picture, but offers proof of the superstition that still\r\nprevails in the Western counties. On Twelfth-even, in Devonshire, it\r\nis customary for the farmer to leave his warm fireside, accompanied by\r\na band of rustics, with guns, blunderbusses, &c., presenting an\r\nappearance which at other times would be somewhat alarming. Thus\r\narmed, the band proceeds to an adjoining orchard, where is selected\r\none of the most fruitful and aged of the apple-trees, grouping round\r\nwhich they stand and offer up their invocations in the following\r\nquaint doggerel rhyme:--\r\n\r\n    \"'Here's to thee,\r\n      Old apple-tree!\r\n  Whence thou mayst bud,\r\n  And whence thou mayst blow,\r\n  And whence thou mayst bear\r\n      Apples enow:\r\n      Hats full,\r\n      Caps full,\r\n  Bushels, bushels, sacks full,\r\n  And my pockets full too!\r\n      Huzza! huzza!'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WASSAILING THE APPLE-TREES IN DEVONSHIRE.]\r\n\r\nThe cider-jug is then passed round, and, with many a hearty shout, the\r\nparty fire off their guns, charged with powder only, amidst the\r\nbranches, sometimes frightening the owl from its midnight haunt. With\r\nconfident hopes they return to the farmhouse, and are refused\r\nadmittance, in spite of all weather, till some lucky wight guesses\r\naright the peculiar roast the maidens are preparing for their comfort.\r\nThis done, all enter, and soon right merrily the jovial glass goes\r\nround, that man who gained admittance receiving the honour of King for\r\nthe evening, and till a late hour he reigns, amidst laughter, fun, and\r\njollity. The origin of this custom is not known, but it is supposed to\r\nbe one of great antiquity.\r\n\r\n\"'The illustration is from a sketch by Mr. Colebrooke, Stockdale.'\"\r\n\r\nWe may add that, in the seventeenth century, a similar custom seems to\r\nhave been observed in some places on Christmas Eve, for in Herrick's\r\n_Hesperides_ the wassailing of fruit trees is among the Christmas Eve\r\nceremonies:--\r\n\r\n \"Wassail the trees, that they may beare\r\n  You many a plum, and many a peare;\r\n  For more or less fruits they will bring,\r\n  As you do give them wassailing.\"\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS MORNING IN EXETER CATHEDRAL.\r\n\r\nWriting from Exeter, in 1852, a correspondent says \"the custom of\r\nwelcoming this season of holy joy with 'psalms and hymns and spiritual\r\nsongs' lingers in the cathedral city of Exeter; where, during\r\nChristmas Eve, the parish choirs perambulate the streets singing\r\nanthems, with instrumental accompaniments. The singing is protracted\r\nthrough the night, when the celebration often assumes a more secular\r\ncharacter than is strictly in accordance with the festival. A more\r\nsacred commemoration is, however, at hand.\r\n\r\n\"At a quarter-past seven o'clock on Christmas morning the assemblage\r\nof persons in the nave of Exeter Cathedral is usually very numerous:\r\nthere are the remnants of the previous vigil, with unwashed faces and\r\nsleepy eyes; but a large number are early risers, who have left their\r\nbeds for better purposes than a revel. There is a great muster of the\r\nchoir, and the fine Old Hundredth Psalm is sung from the gallery to a\r\nfull organ, whose billows of sound roll through the vaulted edifice.\r\nThe scene is strikingly picturesque: all is dim and shadowy; the red\r\nlight from the flaring candles falling upon upturned faces, and here\r\nand there falling upon a piece of grave sculpture, whilst the grey\r\nlight of day begins to stream through the antique windows, adding to\r\nthe solemnity of the scene. As the last verse of the psalm peals\r\nforth, the crowd begins to move, and the spacious cathedral is soon\r\nleft to the more devout few who remain to attend the morning service\r\nin the Lady-chapel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA WELSH CHRISTMAS.\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Christmas Chronicles of Llanfairpwllycrochon,\" by R. P.\r\nHampton Roberts, in _Notes and Queries_, December 21, 1878, we quote\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n\"Now Thomas Thomas, and Mary Jones, and all their neighbours, had\r\ngreat veneration for Christmas, and enjoyed much pleasure in\r\nlooking forward to the annual recurrence of the feast. Not that\r\nthey looked upon it as a feast in any ecclesiastical sense, for\r\nLlanfairpwllycrochon was decidedly Calvinistically Methodist, and\r\nrejected all such things as mere popish superstition.\r\n\r\n\"The Christmas goose was a great institution at Llanfairpwllycrochon.\r\nThe annual goose club had no existence there, it is true, but the\r\nannual goose had nevertheless. Thomas Thomas, after his memorable\r\nvisit to London, came home imbued with one English idea which startled\r\nthe villagers more than anything had done since the famous bonfire on\r\nthe outlying hill when the heir came of age, and it was a long time\r\nbefore they recovered from their surprise. It was nothing less\r\nthan a proposition to substitute beef for the Christmas dinner\r\ninstead of a goose. Here was a sad falling off from the ways of\r\nLlanfairpwllycrochon! And Thomas Thomas was a man who persisted in an\r\nidea once it entered his mind--an event of rare occurrence, it is\r\ntrue, and consequently all the more stubborn whenever it did occur.\r\nThomas Thomas had, however, sufficient respect for the opinion of his\r\nneighbours to make him compromise matters by providing for himself\r\nalone a small beefsteak as an adjunct to the time-honoured goose.\r\n\r\n\"Another Christmas institution at Llanfairpwllycrochon was the\r\nuniversal pudding, mixed as is wont by every member of the family.\r\nThen there was the bun-loaf, or _barabrith_, one of the grand\r\ninstitutions of Llanfairpwllycrochon. Many were the pains taken over\r\nthis huge loaf--made large enough to last a week or fortnight,\r\naccording to the appetites of the juvenile partakers--and the combined\r\n\"Christmas-boxes\" of the grocer and baker went to make up the\r\nappetising whole, with much more in addition.\r\n\r\n\"Christmas Eve was a day of exceeding joy at Llanfairpwllycrochon. The\r\nmanufacture of paper ornaments and 'kissing bushes,' radiant with\r\noranges, apples, paper roses, and such like fanciful additions as\r\nmight suit the taste or means of the house-holder, occupied most of\r\nthe day. And then they had to be put up, and the house in its\r\nChristmas decorations looked more resplendent than the imagination of\r\nthe most advanced villager--at present at school, and of the mature\r\nage of five and a half years, the rising hope of the schoolmaster, and\r\na Lord Chancellor in embryo in fine--could have pictured. As a reward\r\nfor the day's toil came the night's sweet task of making _cyflath_,\r\n_i.e._, toffee. Thomas Thomas, and those who spoke the Saxon tongue\r\namong the villagers, called it 'taffy.' Once had Thomas Thomas been\r\ncorrected in his pronunciation, but the hardy Saxon who ventured on\r\nthe bold proceeding was silenced when he heard that he was not to\r\nthink he was going to persuade a reasonable man into mutilating the\r\nEnglish tongue. 'Taffy it iss, and taffy I says,' and there was an end\r\nof the matter. Without taffy the inhabitants of Llanfairpwllycrochon,\r\nit was firmly believed by the vicar, would not have known the\r\ndifference between Christmas and another time, and it is not therefore\r\nmatter for surprise that they should so tenaciously cling to its\r\nannual making. At midnight, when the syrupy stuff was sufficiently\r\nboiled, it would be poured into a pan and put into the open air to\r\ncool. Here was an opportunity for the beaux of the village which could\r\nnot be missed. They would steal, if possible, the whole, pan and all,\r\nand entail a second making on the unfortunate victims of their\r\npractical joke.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes the Christmas Eve proceedings would be varied by holding a\r\nlarge evening party, continued all night, the principal amusement of\r\nwhich would be the boiling of toffee, one arm taking, when another was\r\ntired, the large wooden spoon, and turning the boiling mass of sugar\r\nand treacle, this process being continued for many hours, until\r\nnothing would be left to partake of but a black, burnt sort of crisp,\r\nsugary cinder. Sometimes the long boiling would only result in a soft\r\nmass, disagreeable to the taste and awkward to the hand, the combined\r\nefforts of each member of the party failing to secure consistency or\r\nstrength in the mixed ingredients.\r\n\r\n\"And then there were the carols at midnight, and many more were the\r\nChristmas customs at Llanfairpwllycrochon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF THE SEASON.\r\n\r\n  \"These Christmas decorations are _so_ jolly!\"\r\n     She cried, zeal shining in her orbs of blue.\r\n  \"_Don't_ you like laurel gleaming under holly?\"\r\n     He answered, \"_I_ love mistletoe over _yew_!\"--_Punch._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"ST. GEORGE\" IN COMBAT WITH \"ST. PETER.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nYORKSHIRE SWORD-ACTORS.\r\n\r\nUnder this title, Mr. T. M. Fallow, M.A., F.S.A., writing in the\r\n_Antiquary_, May, 1895, gives an account of rustic performances which\r\nwere witnessed at Christmastide in the neighbourhood of Leeds about\r\nfifteen years earlier, and he illustrates the subject with a series of\r\npictures from photographs taken at the time, which are here\r\nreproduced. The play depicted is that of the \"Seven Champions of\r\nChristendom,\" and in the picture on the preceding page \"St. George\" is\r\nshown engaged in combat with \"St. Peter,\" while \"St. Andrew\" and \"St.\r\nDenys\" are each kneeling on one knee, a sign of their having been\r\nvanquished.\r\n\r\n\"It may be well to point out,\" says Mr. Fallow, \"that in the West\r\nRiding, or at any rate in the neighbourhood of Leeds, the sword-actors\r\nwere quite distinct from the 'mummers.' They generally numbered nine\r\nor ten lads, who, disguised by false beards as men, were dressed in\r\ncostume as appropriate to the occasion as their knowledge and finances\r\nwould permit, and who acted, with more or less skill, a short play,\r\nwhich, as a rule, was either the 'Peace Egg' or the 'Seven Champions\r\nof Christendom.' The following illustration shows two of the\r\n'champions,' as photographed at the time stated:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"ST. PETER.\" \"ST. DENYS.\"]\r\n\r\n\"There was a little indefiniteness,\" says Mr. Fallow, \"as to the\r\ncharacters represented in the play, but usually they were the King of\r\nEgypt, his daughter, a fool or jester, St. George, St. Andrew, St.\r\nPatrick, St. David, St. Denys, St. James, and a St. Thewhs, who\r\nrepresented a Northern nation--Russia, or sometimes Denmark--and whose\r\nexact identity seems obscure. The seven champions occasionally\r\nincluded St. Peter of Rome, as in the group whose photograph is given.\r\nSt. George engaged in mortal combat with each champion in succession,\r\nfighting for the hand of the King of Egypt's daughter. When at length\r\neach of the six was slain, St. George, having vanquished them all, won\r\nthe fair lady, amid the applause of the bystanders. Then, at the\r\nconclusion, after a general clashing and crossing of swords, the fool\r\nor jester stepped forward, and wound up the performance with an appeal\r\nfor pecuniary recognition.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER CHRISTMAS PERFORMANCES.\r\n\r\nIn a Christmas article, published in 1869, Dr. Rimbault mentions the\r\nperformance of \"St. George and the Dragon\" in the extreme western and\r\nnorthern parts of the country. The following five characters are\r\ngiven: Father Christmas, Turkish Knight, King of Egypt, St. George,\r\nDoctor. Other writers mention similar plays, with variations of\r\ncharacters, as seen in the rural parts of Northamptonshire,\r\nWarwickshire, and Staffordshire, and the present writer has himself\r\nseen such plays at Madeley, in Shropshire.\r\n\r\nS. Arnott, of Turnham Green, writing in _Notes and Queries_, December\r\n21, 1878, says: \"When I was living at Hollington, near Hastings, in\r\nthe year 1869, the village boys were in the habit of visiting the\r\nhouses of the gentry at Christmas time to perform a play, which had\r\nbeen handed down by tradition.\" The description of the play which then\r\nfollowed shows that it was another variation of the well-known\r\nChristmas play, and included the \"Turkish Knight,\" the \"Bold Slasher,\"\r\nand other familiar characters.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SCOTCH FIRST FOOTING.\r\n\r\nWriting on \"Mid-winter Customs in the North,\" Mr. Edward Garrett says\r\n\"it is not easy to write of 'Christmas customs in the North,' because\r\nmany of them, even though connected with the Christmas festival, do\r\nnot take place till January 6th, that being Christmas Day, Old Style,\r\nwhile most of them are associated with the New Year, either Old or New\r\nStyle, one of the most striking celebrations coming off on January\r\n11th, regarded as 'New Year's Eve.'\r\n\r\n\"Christmas itself has never been a national Scottish festival since\r\nthe Reformation. On its purely festive side, it has become somewhat of\r\na 'fashion' of late years, but its ancient customs have only lingered\r\non in those districts where Episcopacy has taken deep root. Such a\r\ndistrict is 'Buchan'--a track of country in the north-east of\r\nAberdeenshire--a place which cannot be better described than in the\r\nwords of one of its own gifted sons, Dr. Walter Smith:--\r\n\r\n \"'A treeless land, where beeves are good,\r\n     And men have quaint, old-fashioned ways,\r\n   And every burn has ballad lore,\r\n     And every hamlet has its song,\r\n   And on its surf-beat, rocky shore\r\n     The eerie legend lingers long.\r\n   Old customs live there, unaware\r\n     That they are garments cast away,\r\n   And what of light is lingering there\r\n     Is lingering light of yesterday.'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SCOTCH FIRST FOOTING.]\r\n\r\n\r\nYULETIDE CUSTOMS IN SHETLAND.\r\n\r\nThe inherent Scandinavianism of the Shetlander, which leads him to\r\nrepudiate the appellation of Scotchman, and to cherish in secret the\r\nold customs and superstitions of his ancestors, asserts itself yearly\r\nin the high jinks with which he continues to honour the old holy days\r\nof Yule. Until within the last two or three years, he pertinaciously\r\nadhered to the old style in his observance of these festivities. On\r\nChristmas Eve, New Year's Eve, and Uphelya--the twenty-fourth day\r\nafter Yule, and that on which the holy or holidays are supposed to be\r\n\"up\"--the youths of Lerwick, attired in fantastic dresses, go\r\n\"guising\" about the town in bands, visiting their friends and\r\nacquaintances and reproducing in miniature the carnival of more\r\nsouthern climes. On one or other of these occasions a torchlight\r\nprocession forms part of the revelry. Formerly blazing tar barrels\r\nwere dragged about the town, and afterwards, with the first break of\r\nmorning, dashed over the Knab into the sea. But this ancient and\r\ndangerous custom has very properly been discontinued. The dresses of\r\nthe guisers are often of the most expensive and fanciful description.\r\nHighlanders, Spanish cavaliers, negro minstrels, soldiers in the\r\npeaked caps, kerseymere breeches, and scarlet coats turned up with\r\nbuff, of the reign of George II., Robin Hoods, and Maid Marians were\r\nfound in the motley throng. Some, with a boldness worthy of\r\nAristophanes himself, caricature the dress, the walk, or some other\r\neccentricity of leading personages in the town; others--for the spirit\r\nof \"the Happy Land\" has reached these hyperborean regions--make\r\npleasant game of well-known political characters. Each band of guisers\r\nhas its fiddler, who walks before it, playing \"Scalloway Lasses,\" or\r\n\"The Foula Reel,\" or \"The Nippin' Grund,\" or some other archaic tune.\r\nThus conducted, and blowing a horn to give notice of their approach,\r\nthe maskers enter the doors of all houses which they find open, dance\r\na measure with the inmates, partake of and offer refreshment, and then\r\ndepart to repeat the same courtesies elsewhere. At daylight the horn\r\nof the Most Worthy Grand Guiser, a mysterious personage, whose\r\npersonality and functions are enveloped in the deepest concealment, is\r\nheard summoning all the bands to end their revels, and when, in the\r\ncold grey dawn of the winter morning, the worthy citizens of Lerwick\r\nawake to pursue their wonted avocations, not a trace remains of the\r\nsaturnalia of the night before.--Sheriff Rampini, in _Good Words_.\r\n\r\nNow, passing from the islands to the sea itself, it is pleasant to\r\nnote that in recent years Christian hearts have carried\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS CHEER TO THE NORTH SEA FISHERMEN.\r\n\r\nThrough the \"Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen\" twelve thousand brave and\r\nhardy fishermen have been cheered at Christmastide, for to their\r\nfleets the Mission's vessels now take medical and surgical aid, books\r\nand magazines, woollen garments and tobacco, which, as adjuncts to\r\nhigher religious aid, are turning the once wild and desperate\r\nocean roughs into clean-living sailors and good husbands and\r\nfathers--therefore are these days on the North Sea better far than\r\nthose that are gone. Thousands of these brave men turn at Christmas to\r\nthe M.D.S.F. flag as to the one bright link which binds them to\r\nfriendly hearts ashore, assuring them that in England's Christmas\r\nfestivities they and their like have a real part, and are no longer\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nSome facts recorded by the Rev. John Sinclair[91] illustrate the\r\ndangers of the wild winter sea, and also set forth some\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS EXPERIENCES IN THE ORKNEY ISLES.\r\n\r\nThey were related to Mr. Sinclair by Mr. Traill, chief of the clan,\r\nwith whom he stayed on the occasion of his visit to the island of\r\nPappa Westra. The first of the two incidents was as follows:--\"One\r\nChristmas Day,\" says Mr. Traill, \"during a heavy gale, I wrapped my\r\ncloak about me, and started off with my telescope to walk upon the\r\ncliffs. Coming to the other side of the island, on which the surf was\r\nbeating violently, I observed a vessel a few miles off fire a signal\r\nof distress. I hastened to the nearest point, and with the help of my\r\nglass perceived that she was Dutch built, and that, having lost her\r\nrudder, she was quite unmanageable. She fired several guns at short\r\nintervals, and my people came in large numbers to give assistance. But\r\nthe surf was so fearful that nothing could be done. No boat could have\r\nlived a moment in such a sea. We were all utterly helpless. As the\r\nvessel drifted towards us, I could see the whole tragedy as distinctly\r\nas if it had been acted on the stage. Immediately below me were a\r\nnumber of my fellow-creatures, now alive and in health, and in a few\r\nmoments they would all be mangled corpses. I could make out the\r\nexpression of their features, and see in what manner each was\r\npreparing for inevitable death. But whether they climbed up into the\r\nshrouds, or held by ropes on deck while the sea was washing over the\r\nbulwarks, their fate was the same. The first wave lifted the vessel so\r\nhigh that I almost thought it would have placed her upon the land. She\r\nfell back, keel upwards. The next wave struck her with such terrific\r\nforce against the cliffs that she was shivered at once into a thousand\r\npieces; hardly two planks held together. It seemed as if she had been\r\nmade of glass. Not a soul escaped. One or two bodies, with a few\r\nplanks and casks, were all that ever reached the shore.\" Well might\r\nMr. Traill add, \"I was haunted for months by the remembrance of that\r\nheartrending sight.\"\r\n\r\nThe other story related by Mr. Traill shows that a Christmas party may\r\nbe detained indefinitely in one of these remote islands, should the\r\nweather prove unfavourable. At Christmastide, a former Laird of Westra\r\n\"collected a numerous party from all the neighbouring islands to\r\ncelebrate the christening of his eldest son.\" His hospitalities cost\r\nhim dear. A storm arose; his guests could not get away; instead of\r\nenjoying their society for a few days, he was obliged to entertain\r\nthem at a ruinous expense for many weeks. His larder, his cellar, and\r\nhis barns, were by degrees exhausted. His farm stock had all\r\n\r\nbeen slaughtered, except the old bull, which he was reserving as a\r\nlast resource, when at length the wind abated, and a calm delivered\r\nhim from this ruinous situation.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that in these remote islands of Scotland Christmas is\r\nnot forgotten. But a writer in a well-known Scotch journal says the\r\nsurest sign of the general joy is \"Christmas in the Workhouse\":--\r\n\r\n \"Christmas was gay in the old squire's hall,\r\n    Gay at the village inn,\r\n  Cheery and loud by the farmer's fire,\r\n    Happy the manse within;\r\n  But the surest signs of the general joy,\r\n    And that all the world was happy--very,\r\n  Were the sounds that proved at the workhouse door\r\n    That even 'the paupers' were merry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA REMARKABLE CHRISTMAS GATHERING.\r\n\r\nThe Greenwich Hospital for Sick Seamen of all Nations presented on\r\nChristmas Day, 1880, a remarkable gathering of national\r\nrepresentatives. There were 179 sailors, representing 31\r\nnationalities, belonging to ships of 19 distinct nations. They were\r\nsummed up thus:--England, 77; Wales, 3; Scotland, 9; Ireland, 11;\r\nNorway, 10; Sweden, 9; Finland, 6; United States, 5; Denmark, 5;\r\nBritish India, 4; France, 3; Germany, 3; Nova Scotia, 3; Russia, 2;\r\nAustria, 2; Italy, 2; Cape de Verd Islands, 2; Chili, 2; Jamaica, 2;\r\nBarbadoes, 2; St. Thomas, 2; Spain, 1; Portugal, 1; Canada, 1; New\r\nBrunswick, 1; Transvaal, 1; Gold Coast, 1; Brazil, 1; St. Kitts, 1;\r\nMauritius, 1; Society Islands, 1. The mercantile marines represented\r\nwere no bad index to the proportion of the carrying trade of the world\r\neach nation undertakes:--England, 96 vessels; Ireland, 3; Scotland,\r\n16; Wales, 4; Norway, 7; Sweden, 5; United States, 6; Denmark, 2;\r\nFrance, 2; Germany, 3; Nova Scotia, 7; Russia, 2; Netherlands, 4;\r\nChannel Islands, 2; New Brunswick, 2; Italy, 1; Zanzibar, 1; Spain, 1.\r\n\r\nThe early morning brought warm Christmas wishes to the patients. Each\r\nfound by his bedside a packet addressed to him by name. Some good lady\r\nhad taken the enormous pains to work a pretty, and, at the same time,\r\nstout and serviceable wallet, with the inscription, \"My letters,\"\r\nembroidered thereupon, and to accompany this little gift, in every\r\ncase, with a short and seasonable letter of Christmas wishes, using\r\nother languages than English, to suit the convenience of every\r\nrecipient. The initials under which these offerings came were \"N. C.\r\nH.\" Other gifts, Christmas cards and Christmas reading, in the shape\r\nof magazines and illustrated papers were gladly welcomed.\r\n\r\nThe decorations of the corridors and rooms had given occupation to the\r\nsick sailors for several days, and sentiments of loyalty to the Queen\r\nand the Royal Family were abundantly displayed, together with\r\nportraits of members of the Royal Family which had been drawn from\r\nfancy.\r\n\r\nThe officers and nurses had dedicated to them some specimens of real\r\nsailor poetry, combining the names of the staff. With grim humour, the\r\n\"operation room\" bore above it \"Nil desperandum\"; and the decorated\r\nwalls of the hospital told the onlookers that \"small vessels should\r\nkeep in shore,\" that \"windmills are not turned by a pair of bellows,\"\r\nthat \"good things are not found in heaps,\" that \"hasty people fish in\r\nempty ponds,\" that \"plenty, like want, ruins many,\" &c.\r\n\r\nThe dinner at one o'clock was a great success. All who could get out\r\nof bed made it a point of honour to be present. But for adverse winds\r\nkeeping ships from entering the Thames, the guests would have been\r\nmore numerous. But, as it was, the patients under the roof numbered\r\n179. There were, of course, difficulties of language; but no \"Jack\"\r\never ploughed the sea who does not understand a Christmas dinner; and,\r\nbesides, the hospital in its nurses and staff possesses the means of\r\nconversing in seventeen different languages.\r\n\r\nThe scene was a thoroughly Christmas one; and many other festive\r\nscenes, almost as interesting, were seen in all parts of England.\r\nWhether recorded or unrecorded, who does not rejoice in such efforts\r\nto promote \"goodwill amongst men,\" and long for the time--\r\n\r\n \"When peace shall over all the earth\r\n    Its ancient splendours fling,\r\n  And the whole world send back the song,\r\n    Which now the angels sing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS CRACKERS.\r\n\r\nOne of the popular institutions inseparable from the festivities of\r\nChristmastide has long been the \"cracker.\" The satisfaction which young\r\npeople especially experience in pulling the opposite ends of a gelatine\r\nand paper cylinder is of the keenest, accompanied as the operation is by\r\na mixed anticipation--half fearful as to the explosion that is to\r\nfollow, and wholly delightful with regard to the bonbon or motto which\r\nwill thus be brought to light. Much amusement is afforded to the lads\r\nand lassies by the fortune-telling verses which some of the crackers\r\ncontain. But the cracker of our early days was something far different\r\nfrom what it is now. The sharp \"crack\" with which the article exploded,\r\nand from which it took its name, was then its principal, and, in some\r\ncases, its only feature; and the exclamation, \"I know I shall scream,\"\r\nwhich John Leech, in one of his sketches, puts into the mouth of two\r\npretty girls engaged in cracker-pulling, indicated about the all of\r\ndelight which that occupation afforded. Since then, however, the cracker\r\nhas undergone a gradual development. Becoming by degrees a receptacle\r\nfor bon-bons, rhymed mottoes, little paper caps and aprons, and similar\r\ntoys, it has passed on to another and higher stage, and is even made a\r\nvehicle for high art illustrations. Considerable artistic talent has\r\nbeen introduced in the adornment of these novelties. For instance, the\r\n\"Silhouette\" crackers are illustrated with black figures, comprising\r\nportraits of well-known characters in the political, military, and\r\nsocial world, exquisitely executed, while appropriate designs have been\r\nadapted to other varieties, respectively designated \"Cameos,\"\r\n\"Bric-a-brac,\" \"Musical Toys,\" &c.; and it is quite evident that the\r\neducation of the young in matters of good taste is not overlooked in the\r\nprovision of opportunities for merriment.\r\n\r\nSANTA CLAUS AND THE STOCKING.\r\n\r\n  Hang up the baby's stocking! Be\r\n   sure you don't forget! The dear\r\n    little dimpled darling, she never\r\n     saw   Christmas   yet!   But   I've\r\n     told her all about it, and she opened\r\n     her  big  blue  eyes; and I'm sure\r\n     she understood it--she  looked so\r\n     funny and wise. * * *  Dear, what\r\n    a tiny stocking!  It doesn't take\r\n   much to hold such little pink toes\r\n  as baby's away from the frost and\r\n cold.  But then,  for  the baby's\r\n Christmas, it will never do at all.\r\n  Why! Santa wouldn't be looking\r\n   for    anything    half   so\r\n    small.  * * *  I know what\r\n     will do for the baby. I've\r\n      thought of the very best\r\n       plan.   I'll  borrow  a\r\n        stocking  of Grandma's,\r\n         the longest that ever\r\n          I can.  And  you'll\r\n          hang  it  by  mine,\r\n          dear mother, right\r\n         here in the corner,\r\n        so!   And  leave  a\r\n       letter to Santa, and\r\n      fasten   it on to the\r\n     toe. * * * Write--this\r\n    is the baby's stocking,\r\n   that hangs in the corner\r\n    here.  You  never have\r\n     seen her, Santa, for\r\n      she only came this\r\n       year.   But  she's\r\n        just the blessed'st\r\n         baby.   And  now\r\n          before  you  go,\r\n           just  cram  her\r\n            stocking  with\r\n            goodies, from\r\n             the top clean\r\n               down to\r\n                 the\r\n                  toe!\r\n\r\n\r\nFATALLY BURNT IN CHRISTMAS COSTUMES.\r\n\r\nThe Christmastide of 1885-6 was marred by two fatal accidents which\r\nagain illustrate the danger of dressing for entertainments in\r\nhighly-inflammable materials. In the first case a London lady, on\r\nBoxing Night, was entertaining some friends, and appeared herself in\r\nthe costume of _Winter_. She was dressed in a white robe of thin\r\nfabric, and stood under a canopy from which fell pieces of cotton wool\r\nto represent snowflakes, and in their descent one of them caught light\r\nat the candelabra, and fell at deceased's feet. In trying to put it\r\nout with her foot her dress caught fire, and she was immediately\r\nenveloped in flames. So inflammable was the material that, although\r\nprompt assistance was rendered, she was so severely burnt as to become\r\nunconscious. A medical man was sent for, and everything possible was\r\ndone for her; but she sank gradually, and died from exhaustion. The\r\nsecond of these tragical incidents plunged a Paris family in deep\r\nsorrow. The parents, who lived in a beautiful detached house in the\r\nRue de la Bienfaisance, had arranged that their children and some\r\nyouthful cousins were to play before a party of friends on New Year's\r\nNight on the stage of a little theatre which had just been added to\r\ntheir house. The play was to represent the decrepit old year going out\r\nand the new one coming in. The eldest daughter, a charming girl of\r\nfourteen, was to be the good genius of 1886, and to be dressed in a\r\nloose transparent robe. On the appointed evening, after the company\r\nhad assembled, she donned her stage costume and ran into her mother's\r\nbedroom to see how it became her. While looking at herself in a mirror\r\non the toilette table her loose sleeve came in contact with the flame\r\nof a candle and blazed up. She screamed for help and tried to roll\r\nherself in the bed clothes; but the bed, being covered with a lace\r\ncoverlet and curtained with muslin was also set on fire, and soon the\r\nwhole room was ablaze. By the time help arrived the girl's clothes\r\nwere all burning into the flesh; but such was her vitality that, in\r\nspite of the dreadful state in which every inch of her body was, she\r\nsurvived the accident many hours.\r\n\r\nSimilar disasters occurred at Christmas festivities in 1889, at\r\nDetroit, and in 1891, at Wortley, Leeds. In the former several little\r\nchildren were fatally burnt, and in the latter fifteen children were\r\nset on fire, eleven of them fatally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS LITERATURE\r\n\r\nis too large a subject to enter upon at length, for a bulky volume\r\nwould scarcely suffice to describe the numerous Christmas annuals,\r\nillustrated Christmas numbers, newspaper supplements and variety\r\npapers which have become popular at Christmastide since the first\r\nappearance of Dickens's \"Christmas Stories.\" The development of the\r\nChristmas trade in this light literature has been marvellous, and it\r\nis increasing year by year. And the same may be said of the charming\r\ngift-books which are published annually just before Christmas.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS LETTER MISSIONS.\r\n\r\nThrough the various letter missions that have been established\r\nthousands of Christmas letters and illustrated missives, bright with\r\nanecdote, are despatched annually to the inmates of convalescent homes\r\nand hospitals, and are heartily welcomed by the recipients, for every\r\none likes to be remembered on Christmas Day.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POST-OFFICE OFFICIALS AND POSTMEN\r\n\r\nhave, however, been very heavily weighted with these new Christmas\r\ncustoms. They have inflicted upon postmen and letter-sorters an amount\r\nof extra labour that is almost incredible. The postal-parcel work is\r\nalso very heavy at the festive season.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RAILWAYS AT CHRISTMAS.\r\n\r\n \"Home for the holidays, here we go;\r\n  Bless me, the train is exceedingly slow!\r\n  Pray, Mr. Engineer, get up your steam,\r\n  And let us be off, with a puff and a scream!\r\n  We have two long hours to travel, you say;\r\n  Come, Mr. Engineer, gallop away!\"[92]\r\n\r\nThis familiar verse recalls the eagerness of the schoolboy to be home\r\nfor the Christmas holidays. And adults are no less eager to join their\r\nfriends at the festive season; many travel long journeys in order to\r\ndo so. Hence the great pressure of work on railway employes, and the\r\ncongested state of the traffic at Christmastide. Two or three days\r\nbefore Christmas Day the newspapers publish what are called \"railway\r\narrangements,\" detailing the privileges granted by this and that\r\ncompany, and presenting the holiday traveller with a sort of\r\nappetising programme; and any one who will spend an hour at any of the\r\ngreat termini of the metropolis at this period can see the remarkable\r\nextent to which the public avail themselves of the facilities offered.\r\nThe growth of railway travelling at Christmastide has, indeed, been\r\nmarvellous in recent years, and it becomes greater every year. The\r\ncrowded state of the railway stations, and the trains that roll out of\r\nthem heavily laden with men, women, and children, wedged together by\r\nparcels bursting with good cheer, show most unmistakably that we have\r\nnot forgotten the traditions of Christmas as a time of happy\r\ngatherings in the family circles of Old England.\r\n\r\n*     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nBut, as there is also much Christmas-keeping in other parts of the\r\nworld, we pass now to--\r\n\r\n    [79] Huish's \"Life of George the Third.\"\r\n\r\n    [80] _Gentleman's Magazine_, 1790.\r\n\r\n    [81] Copied from an undated leaflet inserted in the\r\n    British Museum copy of Brand's \"Antiquities,\" by the late\r\n    Mr Joseph Hazlewood.\r\n\r\n    [82] Hone's \"Every-day Book,\" 1826.\r\n\r\n    [83] Herbert H.

The gallant bands that have from time to time gone\r\nforth to a bloodless campaign in the icy north, have always managed to\r\nkeep their Christmas right joyously. Certainly they could not complain\r\nof uncongenial skies or unseasonable temperatures; while, so far as\r\nsnow and ice are necessary to thorough enjoyment, the supply in the\r\nArctic regions is on a scale sufficient to satisfy the most ardent\r\nadmirer of an old-fashioned Christmas. The frozen-in Investigators\r\nunder McClure kept their first Arctic Christmas soberly, cheerfully,\r\nand in good fellowship, round tables groaning with good cheer, in the\r\nshape of Sandwich Island beef, musk veal from the Prince of Wales's\r\nStrait, mince-meat from England, splendid preserves from the Green\r\nIsle, and dainty dishes from Scotland. Every one talked of home, and\r\nspeculated respecting the doings of dear ones there; and healths were\r\ndrunk, not omitting those of their fellow-labourers sauntering\r\nsomewhere in the regions about, but how near or how far away none\r\ncould tell. When the festival came round again, the _Investigator_ and\r\n_Enterprise_ were alone in their glory, and they were separated by\r\nmiles of frozen sea; but they had solved the great problem.[93] On\r\nboard the _Investigator_, frost-bound in the Bay of Mercy, things went\r\nas merry as the proverbial marriage-bell. After divine service,\r\neverybody took a constitutional on the ice until dinner-time; then the\r\nofficers sat down to a meal of which the _piece de resistance_ was a\r\nhaunch of Banks' Island reindeer, weighing twenty pounds, with fat two\r\ninches thick, and a most delicious flavour; while the crew were\r\nregaling upon venison and other good things, double allowance of grog\r\nincluded; and dinner discussed, dancing, singing, and skylarking\r\nfilled up the holiday hours till bedtime; the fun being kept up with\r\nunflagging humour, and with such propriety withal as to make their\r\nleader wish the anxious folks at home could have witnessed the scene\r\ncreated amidst so many gloomy influences, by the crew of a ship after\r\ntwo years' sojourn in those ice-bound regions upon their own\r\nresources. Another Christmas found the brave fellows still confined in\r\ntheir snowy prison; but their table boasted plum-pudding rich enough\r\nfor Arctic appetites, Banks' Land venison, Mercy Bay hare-soup,\r\nptarmigan pasties, and musk-ox beef--hung-beef, surely, seeing it had\r\nbeen dangling in the rigging above two years. The poets among the men\r\nwrote songs making light of the hardships they had endured; the\r\npainters exhibited pictures of past perils; comic actors were not\r\nwanting; and the whole company, casting all anxiety to the winds,\r\nenjoyed themselves to the utmost.\"[94]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1870, before the breaking out of the Franco-German\r\nwar, Germany sent out two ships, the _Germania_ and the _Hansa_, with\r\nthe hope of reaching the North Pole. As is usually the case in Arctic\r\nexpeditions, little could be done during the first season, and the\r\nships were obliged to take up their winter-quarters off the east coast\r\nof Greenland. They had already been separated, so that the crew of one\r\nvessel, had no idea of the condition of the other. An officer upon the\r\n_Germania_ gives the following interesting account of their Christmas\r\nfestivities in the Arctic regions:--\r\n\r\n\"To the men who have already lived many weary months among the\r\nicebergs, Christmas signifies, in addition to its other associations,\r\nthat the half of their long night--with its fearful storms, its\r\nenforced cessation of all energy, its discomfort and sadness--has\r\npassed, and that the sun will soon again shed its life and\r\nwarmth-giving beams on the long-deserted North. From this time the\r\ngrim twilight, during which noon has been hardly distinguishable from\r\nthe other hours, grows daily lighter, until at length all hearts are\r\ngladdened, and a cheerful activity is once again called forth by the\r\nfirst glimpse of the sun. Christmas, the midnight of the Arctic\r\nexplorer, thus marks a period in his life which he has good cause to\r\nconsider a joyful one.\r\n\r\n\"For days before the festival, an unusual activity was observable all\r\nover the ship; and as soon as the severe storm which raged from\r\nDecember 16th to the 21st had abated, parties were organised, under\r\nour botanist, Dr. Pansch, to certain points of Sabine Island, near to\r\nwhich we were anchored, where, in a strangely sheltered nook, several\r\nvarieties of a native Greenland evergreen plant, _Andromeda\r\ntetragona_, were to be found. A great quantity of this plant was\r\nconveyed on board, to be converted into a Christmas-tree. Under the\r\norders of Dr. Pansch, the Andromeda was wound round small pieces of\r\nwood, several of which were attached, like fir-twigs, to a large\r\nbough; and when these boughs were fastened to a pole, they formed a\r\nvery respectable fir-tree.\r\n\r\n\"After dinner on Christmas Day, the cabin was cleared for the\r\ncompletion of the preparations; and on our recall at six o'clock, we\r\nfound that all had assumed an unwontedly festive appearance. The walls\r\nwere decorated with the signal-flags and our national eagle; and the\r\nlarge cabin table, somewhat enlarged to make room to seat seventeen\r\nmen, was covered with a clean white cloth, which had been reserved for\r\nthe occasion. On the table stood the 'fir' tree, shining in the\r\nsplendour of many little wax-lights, and ornaments with all sorts of\r\nlittle treasures, some of which, such as the gilded walnuts, had\r\nalready seen a Christmas in Germany; below the tree was a small\r\npresent for each of us, provided long beforehand, in readiness for\r\nthe day, by loving friends and relatives at home. There was a packet\r\ntoo for each of the crew, containing some little joking gift, prepared\r\nby the mirth-loving Dr. Pansch, and a useful present also; while the\r\nofficers were each and all remembered.\r\n\r\n\"When the lights burned down, and the resinous Andromeda was beginning\r\nto take fire, the tree was put aside, and a feast began, at which full\r\njustice was done to the costly Sicilian wine with which a friend had\r\ngenerously supplied us before we left home. We had a dish of roast\r\nseal! Some cakes were made by the cook, and the steward produced his\r\nbest stores. For the evening, the division between the fore and aft\r\ncabins was removed, and there was free intercourse between officers\r\nand men; many a toast was drunk to the memory of friends at home, and\r\nat midnight a polar ball was improvised by a dance on the ice. The\r\nboatswain, the best musician of the party, seated himself with his\r\nhand-organ between the antlers of a reindeer which lay near the ship,\r\nand the men danced two and two on their novel flooring of hard ice!\r\n\r\n\"Such was our experience of a Christmas in the north polar circle; but\r\nthe uncertainties of Arctic voyaging are great, and the two ships of\r\nour expedition made trial of the widely different fates which await\r\nthe travellers in those frozen regions: and while we on the _Germania_\r\nwere singularly fortunate in escaping accidents and in keeping our\r\ncrew, in spite of some hardships, in sound health and good spirits,\r\nthe _Hansa_ was crushed by the ice, and her crew, after facing\r\nunheard-of dangers, and passing two hundred days on a block of ice,\r\nwere barely rescued to return home.\"\r\n\r\nYet even to the crew of the ill-fated _Hansa_ Christmas brought some\r\nfestivities. The tremendous gale which had raged for many days ceased\r\njust before the day, and the heavy fall of snow with which it\r\nterminated, and which had almost buried the black huts that the\r\nshipwrecked men had constructed for themselves upon the drifting\r\nicebergs from the _debris_ of the wreck, had produced a considerable\r\nrise in the temperature, and there was every indication that a season\r\nof calm might now be anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe log-book of the _Hansa_ thus describes the celebration of the\r\nfestival:--\"The tree was erected in the afternoon, while the greater\r\npart of the crew took a walk; and the lonely hut shone with wonderful\r\nbrightness amid the snow. Christmas upon a Greenland iceberg! The tree\r\nwas artistically put together of firwood and mat-weed, and Dr. Laube\r\nhad saved a twist of wax-taper for the illumination. Chains of\r\ncoloured paper and newly-baked cakes were not wanting, and the men had\r\nmade a knapsack and a revolver case as a present for the captain. We\r\nopened the leaden chests of presents from Professor Hochstetter and\r\nthe Geological Society, and were much amused by their contents. Each\r\nman had a glass of port wine; and we then turned over the old\r\nnewspapers which we found in the chests, and drew lots for the\r\npresents, which consisted of small musical instruments such as fifes,\r\njew's-harps, trumpets, &c., with draughts and other games, puppets,\r\ncrackers, &c. In the evening we feasted on chocolate and gingerbread.\"\r\n\r\n\"We observed the day very quietly,\" writes Dr. Laube in his diary. \"If\r\nthis Christmas be the last we are to see, it was at least a cheerful\r\none; but should a happy return home be decreed for us, the next will,\r\nwe trust, be far brighter. May God so grant!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS IN THE CRIMEA.\r\n\r\nThe Christmas of 1854 was a dismal one for the soldiers in the Crimea,\r\nwitnessing and enduring what Lord John Russell spoke of as \"the\r\nhorrible and heartrending scenes of that Crimean winter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to General Muddle,\" says a journal of the period, \"the Crimean\r\nChristmas of 1854 was anything but what it ought to and might have\r\nbeen; and the knowledge that plenty of good things had been provided\r\nby thoughtful hearts at home, but which were anywhere but where they\r\nwere wanted, did not add to the merriment of our poor overworked,\r\nunderfed army; and although some desperate efforts were made to be\r\njolly on dreary outpost and in uncomfortable trenches, they only\r\nresulted in miserable failure. The following Christmas was doubly\r\nenjoyable by comparison. The stubborn fortress (Sebastopol) had fallen\r\nat last to its more stubborn assailants; habit had deprived frost and\r\nsnow of their terrors, and every hut ran over with hams, preserves,\r\nvegetables, and mysterious tins, till it resembled a grocer's store.\r\nThe valleys of Miscomia, too, were rich in mistletoe, to be had for\r\nthe trouble of gathering; but few cared to undergo that trouble for\r\nthe sake of what only reminded them of unattainable sweets, and made\r\nthem sigh for the girls they had left behind them.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1855, Messrs. Macmillan & Co. published a poem by H. R. F.,\r\nentitled \"Christmas Dawn, 1854,\" in which the writer pictures the\r\nfestivities marred by war:--\r\n\r\n                    \"A happy Christmas!\r\n  Happy! to whom? Perchance to infancy,\r\n  And innocent childhood, while the germ of sin,\r\n  Yet undeveloped, leaves a virgin soil\r\n  For joy, and Death and Sorrow are but names.\r\n  But who, that bears a mind matured to thought,\r\n  A heart to feel, shall look abroad this day\r\n  And speak of happiness? The church is deckt\r\n  With festive garlands, and the sunbeams glance\r\n  From glossy evergreens; the mistletoe\r\n  Pearl-studded, and the holly's lustrous bough\r\n  Gleaming with coral fruitage; but we muse\r\n  Of laurel blent with cypress. Gaze we down\r\n  Yon crowded aisle? the mourner's dusky weeds\r\n  Sadden the eye; and they who wear them not\r\n  Have mourning in their hearts, or lavish tears\r\n  Of sympathy on griefs too deeply lodged\r\n  For man's weak ministry.\r\n                           A happy Christmas!\r\n  Ah me! how many hearths are desolate!\r\n  How many a vacant seat awaits in vain\r\n  The loved one who returns not! Shall we drain\r\n  The cheerful cup--a health to absent friends?\r\n  Whom do we pledge? the living or the dead?\"\r\n\r\nThus did the poet, \"sick at heart,\" explore \"the realm of sorrow\"; and\r\nthen again he mused:\r\n\r\n \"In humbler mood to hail the auspicious day,\r\n  Shine forth rejoicing in thy strength, O sun,\r\n  Shine through the dubious mists and tearful show'rs\r\n  That darken Hope's clear azure! Christ is born,\r\n  The life of those who wake, and those who sleep--\r\n  The Day-spring from on high hath looked on us;\r\n  And we, who linger militant on earth,\r\n  Are one in Him, with those, the loved and lost,\r\n  Whose early graves keep the red field they won\r\n  Upon a stranger shore. Ah! not in vain\r\n  Went up from many a wild Crimean ridge\r\n  The soldier's pray'r, responsive to the vows\r\n  Breathed far away in many an English home.\r\n  Not vain the awakened charities, that gush\r\n  Through countless channels--Christian brotherhoods\r\n  Of mercy; and that glorious sister-band\r\n  Who sow by Death's chill waters!--Not in vain,\r\n  My country! ever loved, but dearest now\r\n  In this thine hour of sorrow, hast thou learnt\r\n  To bow to Him who chastens. We must weep--\r\n  We may rejoice in weeping\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS IN ABYSSINIA.\r\n\r\nWherever Englishmen are on the 25th of December, there is Christmas.\r\nWhether it be in the icy regions of the Arctic zone, or in the\r\nsweltering heat of tropical sunshine, the coming round of the great\r\nfeast brings with it to every Englishman a hearty desire to celebrate\r\nit duly. And if this cannot be done in exactly home-fashion, the\r\nfestival is kept as happily as circumstances will allow. In this\r\nspirit did our soldiers keep Christmas in Abyssinia, in 1867, with the\r\nthermometer at seventy-five in the shade, and even here the edibles\r\nincluded at least one traditional dish--a joint of roast beef. There\r\nwas also an abundance of spur-fowls, guinea-fowls, venison, mutton,\r\n&c., and the place in which the festive board was spread was decorated\r\nwith branches of fir and such other substitutes for holly and\r\nmistletoe as could be found.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS-KEEPING IN INDIA\r\n\r\nat different periods shows the same determination of our British\r\nsoldiers to honour the Christmas festival.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, the saviours of our Indian Empire very nearly lost their\r\nChristmas. The army was encamped at Intha, within sight of Nepaul,\r\nwaiting for the rain to clear off and the tents to dry, ere it moved\r\non to drive the Sepoys into the Raptee. The skies cleared on Christmas\r\nmorning, and Lord Clyde was for marching at once, but relented in time\r\nto save the men's puddings from being spoiled--not only relented, but\r\nhimself gave a Christmas banquet, at which the favoured guests sat\r\ndown to well-served tables laden with barons of beef, turkeys, mutton,\r\ngame, fish, fowls, plum-puddings, mince-pies, &c. To allay the thirst\r\nsuch substantial fare created, appeared beakers of pale ale from\r\nBurton and Glasgow; porter from London and Dublin; champagne, moselle,\r\nsherry, and old port, 'rather bothered by travelling twenty miles a\r\nday on a camel back.' Following the chief's example, each regiment had\r\na glorious spread, and throughout the wide expanse of tents sounds of\r\nrejoicing were heard, for the soldiers kept Christmas right merrily.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRITISH SOLDIERS AND SAILORS IN SOUTH AFRICA\r\n\r\ndid their best to observe the Christmas festival in good old English\r\nstyle, even during the sieges of Ladysmith, Kimberley, and Mafeking,\r\nwhen provisions were to be had only at famine prices. The ingenious\r\nTommy Atkins, in distant lands, has often found sylvan substitutes for\r\nmistletoe and holly, and native viands to take the place of\r\nplum-puddings and mince-pies, but it is not so easy to find\r\nsubstitutes for the social circles in old England, and when the time\r\ncomes round for the Christmas dance Tommy's thoughts \"Return again to\r\nthe girl I've left behind me.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, it sometimes falls to the lot of soldiers and war\r\ncorrespondents to spend their Christmas in most outlandish places. Mr.\r\nArchibald Forbes has left on record (in the _English Illustrated\r\nMagazine_, 1885) an interesting account of his own Christmastide in\r\nthe Khyber Pass.\r\n\r\nIn his graphic style the intrepid war correspondent describes the\r\n\"ride long and hard\" which Kinloch and he had through the Khyber to\r\nJelalabad plain to fulfil \"the tryst they had made to spend Christmas\r\nDay with the cheery comrades of Sir Sam Browne's headquarter staff.\"\r\nThey had an adventurous journey together from the Dakka camp to\r\nJumrood, where Forbes left Kinloch with Maude's division.\r\n\r\nFurther on, Mr. Forbes says: \"I am not prepared to be definite, after\r\nfive years, as to the number of plum-puddings forming that little\r\nhillock on the top of my dak-gharry between Jhelum and Peshawur, on\r\nthe apex of which sat the faithful John amidst a whirl of dust. At\r\nPeshawur the heap of Christmas gifts were loaded into the panniers of\r\na camel, and the ship of the desert started on its measured solemn\r\ntramp up through the defiles of the Khyber.\" Then Mr. Forbes tells us\r\nhow he joined Kinloch again at General Maude's headquarters at\r\nJumrood. Kinloch \"had not forgotten his tryst, but meanwhile there\r\nwere military duties to be done.\" After the discharge of these\r\n\"military duties,\" which included a night march to surprise a\r\nbarbarous clan called Zukkur-Kehls, Forbes and Kinloch joined General\r\nTytler's column on its return march to Dakka, because at Dakka they\r\nwould be nearer to their friends of Sir Sam Browne's headquarters.\r\n\"Tytler determined to make his exit from the Zukkur-Kahl Valley by a\r\npreviously unexplored pass, toward which the force moved for its\r\nnight's bivouac. About the entrance to the glen there was a fine\r\nforest of ilex and holly, large, sturdy, spreading trees, whence\r\ndangled long sprays of mistletoe; the mistletoe bough was here indeed,\r\nand Christmas was close, but where the fair ones whom, under other\r\ncircumstances, the amorous youth of our column would have so\r\nenthusiastically led under that spray which accords so sweet a\r\nlicense? The young ones prattled of those impossible joys; but the\r\nseniors, less frivolous, were concerned by the increasing narrowness\r\nof the gorge, and by the dropping fire that hung on our skirts as we\r\nentered it. However, there was but one casualty--a poor fellow of the\r\n17th Regiment had his thigh smashed by a bullet--and we spent the\r\nnight under the ilex trees without further molestation.... It was\r\nChristmas Eve when we sat chatting with young Beatson in his lonely\r\npost by the Chardai streamlet; but a few hours of morning riding would\r\ncarry us to Jellalabad whither Sir Sam Browne's camp had been\r\nadvanced, and we were easy on the score of being true to tryst. As in\r\nthe cold grey dawn we resumed our journey, leaving the young officer\r\nwho had been our host to concern himself with the watchfulness of his\r\npicquets and the vigilance of his patrols, there was a sound of\r\nunintentional mockery in the conventional wish of a 'Merry Christmas'\r\nto the gallant lad, and there was a wistfulness in his answering\r\nsmile.... The road to the encampment, the white canvas of whose\r\ntents showed through the intervening hills, was traversed at a hand\r\ngallop; and presently Kinloch and myself found ourselves in the street\r\nof the headquarter camp, shaking hands with friends and comrades, and\r\ntrying to reply to a medley of disjointed questions. The bugles were\r\nsounding for the Christmas Day Church Parade as we finished a hurried\r\nbreakfast. Out there on the plain the British troops of the division\r\nwere standing in hollow square, the officers grouped in the centre....\r\nThe headquarter street we found swept and garnished, the flagstaff\r\nbedecked with holly, and a regimental band playing 'Home, Sweet Home.'\r\nDear old Sir Sam Browne did not believe in luxury when on campaign,\r\nbut now for the first time I saw him at least comfortable.... The mess\r\nanteroom was the camp street outside the dining tent; and at the\r\nfashionable late hour of eight we 'went in' to dinner, to the strains\r\nof the _Roast Beef of Old England_. It was a right jovial feast, and\r\nthe most cordial good-fellowship prevailed. He would have been a\r\ncynical epicurean who would have criticised the appointments; the\r\nbanquet itself was above all cavil. Rummaging among some old papers\r\nthe other day, I found the _menu_, which deserves to be quoted:\r\n'Soup--Julienne. Fish--Whitebait (from the Cabul River).\r\nEntrees--Cotelettes aux Champignons, Poulets a la Mayonaise.\r\nJoints--Ham and fowls, roast beef, roast saddle of mutton, boiled\r\nbrisket of beef, boiled leg of mutton and caper sauce. Curry--chicken.\r\nSweets--Lemon jelly, blancmange, apricot tart, plum-pudding. Grilled\r\nsardines, cheese fritters, cheese, dessert.' Truth compels the avowal\r\nthat there was no table-linen, nor was the board resplendent with\r\nplate or gay with flowers. Table crockery was deficient, or to be more\r\naccurate, there was none. All the dishes were of metal, and the soup\r\nwas eaten, or rather drunk, out of mugs and iron teacups. But it\r\ntasted none the worse on this account, and let it be recorded that\r\nthere _were_ champagne glasses, while between every two guests a\r\nportly magnum reared its golden head. Except 'The Queen,' of course,\r\nthere were but two toasts after the feast--one was 'Absent Friends,'\r\ndrunk in a wistful silence, and the other, the caterer's health,\r\ngreeted with vociferous enthusiasm. A few fields off the wood had been\r\ncollecting all day for the Christmas camp-fire of the 10th Hussars,\r\nand by ten o'clock the blaze of it was mounting high into the murky\r\ngloom. A right merry and social gathering it was round the bright glow\r\nof this Yule log in a far-off land. The flames danced on the wide\r\ncircle of bearded faces, on the tangled fleeces of the postheens, on\r\nthe gold braid of the forage caps, on the sombre hoods of beshliks....\r\nThe songs ranged from gay to grave; the former mood in the ascendency.\r\nBut occasionally there was sung a ditty, the associations with which\r\nbrought it about that there came something strangely like a tear into\r\nthe voice of the singer, and that a yearning wistfulness fell upon the\r\nfaces of the listeners. The bronzed troopers in the background shaded\r\nwith their hands the fire-flash from their eyes; and as the familiar\r\nhomely strain ceased that recalled home and love and trailed at the\r\nheart strings till the breast felt to heave and the tears to rise,\r\nthere would be a little pause of eloquent silence which told how\r\nthoughts had gone astraying half across the globe to the loved ones in\r\ndear old England, and were loath to come back again to the rum and the\r\ncamp fire in Jellalabad plain. Ah, how many stood or sat around that\r\ncamp fire that were never to see old England more? The snow had not\r\nmelted on the Sufed Koh when half a squadron of the troopers were\r\ndrowned in the treacherous Cabul river. No brighter soul or sweeter\r\nsinger round that fire than Monty Slade; but the life went out of\r\nMonty Slade with his face to the foe and his wet sword grasped in a\r\nsoldier-grip; and he lies under the palm trees by the wells of El\r\nTeb.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS IN CANADA.\r\n\r\nIn Canada the severe and long-continued frosts convert a good deal of\r\nland and water into fields of ice, and skating is a very popular\r\namusement of Christmastide. Sleighing is also very fashionable, and\r\nthe large tracts of country covered with snow afford ample scope for\r\nthe pastime. The jingle of the sleigh bells is heard in all the\r\nprincipal thoroughfares which at the season of the great winter\r\nfestival present quite an animated appearance. The ears of the sleigh\r\ndrivers are usually covered either by the cap or with a comforter,\r\nwhich in very cold weather is also wrapped over the mouth and nose.\r\n\r\n\"Christmas Day,\" says an English Colonist, \"is spent quietly in our\r\nown houses. New Year's Day is the day of general rejoicing, when every\r\none either visits or receives their friends: and so, thinking of the\r\nmerry times we have had in Old England, and comparing them with the\r\nquietness of to-day, we feel more like strangers in a strange land\r\nthan ever before.\r\n\r\n\"As a special treat, we are to have a real English Christmas dinner\r\nto-day, and our housekeeper has made a wonderful plum-pudding. The\r\nturkey is already steaming upon the table, and we soon fall to work\r\nupon him. He is well cooked, but there seems to be something wrong\r\nwith his legs, which are so tough and sinewy that we come to the\r\nconclusion that he must have been training for a walking match. The\r\nrest of the dinner passes off very well, with the exception of the\r\nplum-pudding, which has to be brought to the table in a basin, as it\r\nfirmly refuses to bind.\r\n\r\n\"After dinner we retire to the sitting-room, and sit round the stove\r\ntalking, while those of us addicted to the fragrant weed have a quiet\r\nsmoke. Thus passes Christmas afternoon.\r\n\r\n\"Tea-time soon comes round, and after we have refreshed ourselves, we\r\nresolve to end the day by paying a visit to a neighbour who possesses\r\nan American organ, and Christmas evening closes in to the music of\r\nthose sweet old carols which that evening are heard over the whole\r\nworld wherever an English colony is to be found.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS IN AUSTRALIA.\r\n\r\nChristmas festivities in Australia are carried on in what we should\r\ncall \"summer weather.\" There is no lack of good cheer and good living,\r\nbut cold and snow are at this season unknown, and skating and\r\nsnowballing, as a consequence, are sports unheard of at Christmastide\r\nby the youth in the Antipodes. Large parties and excursions are often\r\narranged for spending a short time in the parks and fields, and\r\nChristmas picnics partake much of the character of English\r\n\"gipsy-parties.\" The inhabitants being chiefly English, many of the\r\nceremonies customary in English homes are observed, and the changes\r\nthat are made are enforced for the most part by the difference in\r\nclimate, and by the altered circumstances under which the various\r\nfestivities are arranged.\r\n\r\nIn \"A Summer Christmas,\" Douglas B. W. Sladen thus describes the\r\nAustralian festivities:--\r\n\r\n \"The Christmas dinner was at two,\r\n  And all that wealth or pains could do\r\n  Was done to make it a success;\r\n  And marks of female tastefulness,\r\n  And traces of a lady's care,\r\n  Were noticeable everywhere.\r\n  The port was old, the champagne dry,\r\n  And every kind of luxury\r\n  Which Melbourne could supply was there.\r\n  They had the staple Christmas fare,\r\n  Roast beef and turkey (this was wild),\r\n  Mince-pies, plum-pudding, rich and mild,\r\n  One for the ladies, one designed\r\n  For Mr. Forte's severer mind,\r\n  Were on the board, yet in a way\r\n  It did not seem like Christmas day\r\n  With no gigantic beech yule-logs\r\n  Blazing between the brass fire-dogs,\r\n  And with 100 deg. in the shade\r\n  On the thermometer displayed.\r\n  Nor were there Christmas offerings\r\n  Of tasteful inexpensive things,\r\n  Like those which one in England sends\r\n  At Christmas to his kin and friends,\r\n  Though the Professor with him took\r\n  A present of a recent book\r\n  For Lil and Madge and Mrs. Forte,\r\n  And though a card of some new sort\r\n  Had been arranged by Lil to face\r\n  At breakfast everybody's place.\r\n  When dinner ended nearly all\r\n  Stole off to lounges in the hall.\r\n\r\n  *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n  All save the two old folks and Lil,\r\n  Who made their hearts expand and thrill\r\n  By playing snatches, slow and clear,\r\n  Of carols they'd been used to hear\r\n  Some half a century ago\r\n  At High Wick Manor, when the two\r\n  Were bashful maidens: they talked on,\r\n  Of England and what they had done\r\n  On byegone Christmas nights at home,\r\n  Of friends beyond the Northern foam,\r\n  And friends beyond that other sea,\r\n  Yet further--whither ceaselessly\r\n  Travellers follow the old track,\r\n  But whence no messenger comes back.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS IN NEW ZEALAND.\r\n\r\nIn 1887, we received a letter from Mr. W. M. Stanton, of Nelson, New\r\nZealand, giving the following interesting account of the colonists'\r\nobservance of Christmas:--\r\n\r\n\"And now, as to Christmas, I wish I could express all I feel on this\r\npeculiarly English season of 'peace and goodwill.' I remember the\r\npicturesque snow (seen here only on the distant blue mountain tops),\r\nthe icy stalactites pendant from the leafless branches, the twitter of\r\nthe robin redbreast, the holly, and the mistletoe, decorated homes,\r\nredolent with the effects of the festive cooking, and the warm blazing\r\nfirelight, the meeting of families and of friends, the waits, the\r\ngrand old peals from the belfries; but, alas, here these childhood\r\nassociations are dispelled, half broken, and we acclimatised denizens\r\nadapt our festivities to other modes--not that we forget the Christmas\r\nseason, but enjoy it differently, as I will briefly tell you, as you\r\nask, 'how we spend Christmas in New Zealand.' First, our ladies\r\ndecorate the churches for the Christmas services, not with the\r\nevergreens of old exclusively; they do indeed affect the holly, ivy,\r\nand (New Zealand) mistletoe, but they make up with umbrageous and rich\r\nferns, lachipoden, lauristinas, Portugal laurels, and our own\r\nbeautiful evergreen, Ngaio, and with all the midsummer flowers at\r\ncommand; then the clerk, the storeman, the merchant, and the mechanic\r\nindulge in 'trips,' or day excursions, in small steamboats, to the\r\nneighbouring bays surrounding small townships, and villages on the\r\ncoast. Others again, take the train for a day's outing and play\r\nquoits, rounders, lawn tennis, and the like; the sportsman, perhaps,\r\npreferring his gun and his dog; families, again, are picnic-mad, for\r\nyour colonist can rival the Cockney any day for making his holiday in\r\nthe country. It may be to 'the rocks' he goes to watch his youngsters\r\npaddling in the rolling tide, or to the toil of clambering up the 'dim\r\nmountain,' which seems to suit their hardy lungs better than the shade\r\nof the 'fern glen,' and a journey of eighteen miles to the Maori Pa is\r\nas nothing. The Union Company's fine coasting steamships run\r\npassengers at half fares at this season, and the result is an\r\ninterchange of visits between the dwellers in Nelson, Wellington,\r\nMarlboro', and Wanjani, amongst whom there is much rivalry and more\r\nfriendship. Then there is the Christmas regatta, the performance of\r\nthe 'Messiah' by the musical societies, and the inevitable evening\r\ndances, and thus the New Zealand Christmas is spent.\r\n\r\n\"I am reminded, by my young clerk, that the mail is about closing, and\r\nthat this letter must also close, if it is to go to-day, and thus I\r\nmust omit the mention of the new year's festivities, which properly\r\nbelong to our numerous Scottish fellow settlers who in their own\r\ncountry ignore Christmas as a popish superstition; they are, however,\r\nnow becoming anglicised ('Englified' they call it) in their habits,\r\nand similarly the Midland county men of England enter into their\r\nCaledonian custom, from the harmless orgies of 'Hagmenae' to the\r\nfrantic capers of 'Gillie Cullum,' to the skirl of the panting piper.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS AT THE SANDWICH ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nIn \"A Voyage in the _Sunbeam_,\" Lady Brassey gives an interesting\r\naccount of the keeping of Christmas, 1876, on the Sandwich Islands. We\r\nquote the following extracts:--\r\n\r\n\"Twenty minutes' hard riding brought us to the door of the 'Volcano\r\nHouse,' from which issued the comforting light of a large wood fire,\r\nreaching half way up the chimney.\r\n\r\n\"Everything at this inn is most comfortable, though the style is rough\r\nand ready. The interior is just now decorated for Christmas, with\r\nwreaths, and evergreens, and ferns, and branches of white plumes, not\r\nunlike _reva-reva_, made from the path of the silver grass.\r\n\r\n\"The grandeur of the view in the direction of the volcano increased as\r\nthe evening wore on. The fiery cloud above the present crater grew in\r\nsize and depth of colour; the extinct crater glowed red in thirty or\r\nforty different places; and clouds of white vapour issued from every\r\ncrack and crevice in the ground, adding to the sulphurous smell with\r\nwhich the atmosphere was laden. Our room faced the volcano: there were\r\nno blinds, and I drew back the curtains and lay watching the splendid\r\nscene until I fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\"_Sunday, December 24th (Christmas Eve)_--I was up at four o'clock to\r\ngaze once more on the wondrous spectacle that lay before me. The\r\nmolten lava still glowed in many places, the red cloud over the fiery\r\nlake was bright as ever, and steam was slowly ascending in every\r\ndirection over hill and valley, till, as the sun rose, it became\r\ndifficult to distinguish clearly the sulphurous vapours from the\r\nmorning mists. We walked down to the Sulphur Banks, about a quarter of\r\na mile from the 'Volcano House,' and burnt our gloves and boots in our\r\nendeavours to procure crystals, the beauty of which generally\r\ndisappeared after a very short exposure to the air. We succeeded,\r\nhowever, in finding a few good specimens, and, by wrapping them at\r\nonce in paper and cotton-wool and putting them into a bottle, hope to\r\nbring them home uninjured.\r\n\r\n\"_Monday, December 25th (Christmas Day)_--Turning in last night was\r\nthe work of a very few minutes, and this morning I awoke perfectly\r\nrefreshed and ready to appreciate anew the wonders of the prospect\r\nthat met my eyes. The pillar of fire was still distinctly visible,\r\nwhen I looked out from my window, though it was not so bright as when\r\nI had last seen it, but even as I looked it began to fade and\r\ngradually disappeared. At the same moment a river of glowing lava\r\nissued from the side of the bank we had climbed with so much\r\ndifficulty yesterday, and slowly but surely overflowed the ground we\r\nhad walked over. You may imagine the feelings with which we gazed upon\r\nthis startling phenomenon, which had it occurred a few hours earlier,\r\nmight have caused the destruction of the whole party.\r\n\r\n*     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\"It would, I think, be difficult to imagine a more interesting and\r\nexciting mode of spending Christmas Eve than yesterday has taught us,\r\nor a stranger situation in which to exchange our Christmas greetings\r\nthan beneath the grass roof of an inn on the edge of a volcano in the\r\nremote Sandwich Islands.\r\n\r\n*     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\"The ride down to Hilo was as dull and monotonous as our upward\r\njourney had been. At last we reached the pier, where we found the\r\nusual little crowd waiting to see us off. The girls who had followed\r\nus when we first landed came forward shyly when they thought they were\r\nunobserved, and again encircled me with _leis_ of gay and fragrant\r\nflowers. The custom of decorating themselves with wreaths on every\r\npossible occasion is in my eyes a charming one, and I like the\r\ninhabitants of Polynesia for their love of flowers.\r\n\r\n\"The whole town was _en fete_ to-day. Natives were riding about in\r\npairs, in the cleanest of bright cotton dresses and the freshest of\r\n_leis_ and garlands. Our own men from the yacht contributed not a\r\nlittle to the gaiety of the scene. They were all on shore, and the\r\ngreater part of them were galloping about on horseback, tumbling off,\r\nscrambling on again, laughing, flirting, joking, and enjoying\r\nthemselves generally after a fashion peculiar to English sailors. As\r\nfar as we know the only evil result of all this merriment was that the\r\ndoctor received a good many applications for diachylon plaster in the\r\ncourse of the evening, to repair various 'abrasions of the cuticle,'\r\nas he expressed it.\r\n\r\n\"I think at least half the population of Hilo had been on board the\r\nyacht in the course of the day, as a Christmas treat. At last we took\r\na boat and went off too, accompanied by Mr. Lyman. The appearance of\r\nthe 'Sunbeam' from the shore was very gay, and as we approached it\r\nbecame more festive still. All her masts were tipped with sugar-canes\r\nin bloom. Her stern was adorned with flowers, and in the arms of the\r\nfigurehead was a large bouquet. She was surrounded with boats, the\r\noccupants of which cheered us heartily as we rode alongside. The whole\r\ndeck was festooned with tropical plants and flowers, and the\r\ndecorations of the cabins were even more beautiful and elaborate. I\r\nbelieve all hands had been hard at work ever since we left to produce\r\nthis wonderful effect, and every garden in Hilo had furnished a\r\ncontribution to please and surprise us on our return.\r\n\r\n\"The choir from Hilo came out in boats in the evening, sang all sorts\r\nof songs, sacred and secular, and cheered everybody till they were\r\nhoarse. After this, having had a cold dinner, in order to save\r\ntrouble, and having duly drunk the health of our friends at home, we\r\nall adjourned to the saloon, to assist in the distribution of some\r\nChristmas presents--a ceremony which afforded great delight to the\r\nchildren, and which was equally pleasing to the elder people and to\r\nthe crew, if one may judge from their behaviour on the occasion.\r\n\r\n\"Then we sat on deck, gazing at the cloud of fire over Kilauea, and\r\nwondering if the appearance of the crater could ever be grander than\r\nit was last night, when we were standing on its brim.\r\n\r\n\"So ended Christmas Day, 1876, at Hilo, in Hawaii. God grant that\r\nthere may be many more as pleasant for us in the future!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS ON BOARD THE \"SUNBEAM,\" 1879.\r\n\r\n                \"The wind is chill,\r\n  But let it whistle as it will\r\n  We'll keep our Christmas merry still.\"\r\n\r\nIn \"Sunshine and Storm in the East, or Cruises to Cyprus and\r\nConstantinople,\" Lady Brassey gives an interesting account of the\r\ncelebration of Christmas on board the _Sunbeam_, between Malta and\r\nMarseilles, December 25, 1879:--\"We had service early and then spent a\r\nlong busy morning in arranging all the presents for the children,\r\nservants, and crew, and in decorating the cabin. We could not manage\r\nany holly, but we had carefully preserved one bough of mistletoe from\r\nArtaki Bay, and had brought on board at Malta baskets full of flowers,\r\nso that all the pictures, lamps, and even walls, were wreathed with\r\nfestoons of bougainvillaea, ivy, and other creeping plants; while in\r\nevery available corner were placed, vases, bowls, and soup-plates,\r\ncontaining flowers. If not exactly 'gay with holly-berries,' so dear\r\nto English hearts from their association with yule-tide at home, the\r\ngeneral appearance of the cabins was highly satisfactory. In the\r\nmeantime they had been busy in the kitchen and pantry departments,\r\npreparing all sorts of good things for dinner, and pretty things for\r\ndessert, in order that the crew and servants might enjoy a more\r\nsumptuous repast than usual. A Christmas tree, a snow man, or an ice\r\ncave, for the distribution of presents, was not within the limit of\r\nour resources; but we decorated our tables and sideboards with bright\r\nshawls and scarves, and wreathed and divided the surface of each with\r\ngarlands of flowers, placing in every division a pretty Christmas\r\ncard, bearing the name of the recipient of the present, which was\r\nhidden away among the flowers beneath.... For the men there was plenty\r\nof tobacco, besides books and useful things; for the children toys;\r\nand for ourselves, slippers and little remembrances of various kinds,\r\nsome sent from home to meet us, others recent purchases. The\r\ndistribution over, one or two speeches were made, and mutual\r\ncongratulations and good wishes were exchanged. Then the crew and\r\nservants retired to enjoy the, to them, all-important event of the\r\nday--dinner and dessert. After our own late dinner, we thought of\r\nthose near and dear to us at home, and drank to the health of 'absent\r\nfriends.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA MISSIONARY'S CHRISTMAS IN CHINA.\r\n\r\nIn a letter from Tsing Cheu Fu Chefoo, December 24, 1887, the Rev. A.\r\nG. Jones, Baptist missionary, says:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Dawson asks how Englishmen spend Christmas in China. Well, it\r\ndepends. Some spend it at the ports dog-racing and eating\r\npudding--having a night of it. The missionaries generally take no\r\nnotice of it. In our mission we hold one of the semi-annual\r\ndedication-of-children services on Christmas. We think it a very\r\nappropriate day for the recognition of the sacredness of the gift of\r\ntrust of children. The idea is a Chinese one, originating with one of\r\nour Christians, and we adopted it as the day for the custom.\r\nTomorrow will be Christmas Day, and I have come out twenty miles\r\nthis evening to hold a service of that kind with the semi-annual\r\ncommunion as it happens. It will be a cold, cheerless room in a\r\nclay-built cabin down in the corner of a bare valley in a trap and\r\nbasalt district with sparse vegetation and a bare aspect. A cold spot\r\nwith a handful of Christians, bearing their testimony alone out on the\r\nmargin of our field of work. I hope to see 40 or 50 patients up to\r\nsundown, and then have worship with them at night. That will be my\r\nChristmas. This evening--in the city--all the children and our wives\r\nare having a Christmas tree in the theological lecture-room, and on\r\nTuesday next I guess we'll have our dinner. John Bull, Paddy, Sandy,\r\nand Taffy all seem to agree in _that_ feature. My Sunday will only be\r\na sample of others. So it goes--working away. Now I must say goodbye.\r\nMany thanks and many good wishes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO CHRISTMAS ISLAND.\r\n\r\nLetters were received in December, 1887, from H.M.S. _Egeria_,\r\nCommander Pelham Aldrich, containing particulars of a visit she had\r\nrecently made to Christmas Island, which she was ordered to explore\r\nfor scientific purposes. Christmas Island is situated in the Indian\r\nOcean, in latitude 11 deg. south, longitude 105 deg. 30' east; it is 1,100\r\nfeet above the sea, is twelve miles long and eight miles broad. The\r\nofficers and men told off for exploring purposes found that the whole\r\nplace was composed of coral and rock; notwithstanding this, however,\r\nit is covered almost completely with trees and shrubs, the trees,\r\nwhich are of large dimensions, seeming to grow literally out of the\r\nrock itself, earth surfaces being conspicuous by their absence. It is\r\nuninhabited by human beings, nor could any traces of animals be\r\ndiscovered, but seabirds swarm over every part of the island, and\r\nabout four hundred wood pigeons were shot by the explorers while they\r\nremained there. No fruits or vegetable matter fit for consumption\r\ncould, however, be found, nor the existence of any supply of fresh\r\nwater, and the belief is that the vegetation of the island is\r\ndependent for nourishment on the dews and the heavy rains that fall.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\nWriting just before the Christmas festival of 1855, Mr. Howard Paul\r\nsays the general manner of celebrating Christmas Day is much the same\r\nwherever professors of the Christian faith are found; and the United\r\nStates, as the great Transatlantic offshoot of Saxon principles, would\r\nbe the first to conserve the traditional ceremonies handed down from\r\ntime immemorial by our canonical progenitors of the East. But every\r\nnation has its idiocratic notions, minute and otherwise, and it is not\r\nstrange that the Americans, as a creative people, have peculiar and\r\nvaried ways of their own in keeping this, the most remarkable day in\r\nthe calendar. Now and then they add a supplemental form to the\r\naccepted code--characteristic of the mutable and progressive spirit of\r\nthe people--though there still exists the Church service, the\r\nconventional carol, the evergreen decorations, the plum-puddings, the\r\npantomime, and a score of other \"demonstrations\" that never can\r\nlegitimately be forgotten.\r\n\r\nSociety generally seems to apportion the day thus: Church in the\r\nmorning, dinner in the afternoon, and amusements in the evening. The\r\nChristmas dinners concentrate the scattered members of families, who\r\nmeet together to break bread in social harmony, and exchange those\r\nhome sentiments that cement the happiness of kindred. To-day the\r\nprodigal once more returns to the paternal roof; the spendthrift\r\nforsakes his boon companions; the convivialist deserts the wine-cup.\r\nThe beautiful genius of domestic love has triumphed, and who can\r\nforesee the blessed results?\r\n\r\nParties, balls, and fetes, with their endless routine of gaieties, are\r\nlooked forward to, as pleasures are, the wide world over; and all\r\nclasses, from highest to lowest, have their modes of enjoyment marked\r\nout. Preparation follows preparation in festal succession. Sorrow\r\nhides her Gorgon head, care may betake itself to any dreary recesses,\r\nfor Christmas must be a gala!\r\n\r\nThere is generally snow on the ground at this time; if Nature is\r\namiable, there is sure to be; and a Christmas sleigh-ride is one of\r\nthose American delights that defy rivalry. There is no withstanding\r\nthe merry chime of the bells and a fleet passage over the snow-skirted\r\nroads. Town and country look as if they had arisen in the morning in\r\nrobes of unsullied white. Every housetop is spangled with the bright\r\nelement; soft flakes are coquetting in the atmosphere, and a pure\r\nmantle has been spread on all sides, that fairly invites one to\r\ndisport upon its gleaming surface.\r\n\r\nWe abide quietly within our pleasant home on either the eve or night\r\nof Christmas. How the sleighs glide by in rapid glee, the music of the\r\nbells and the songs of the excursionists falling on our ears in very\r\nwildness. We strive in vain to content ourselves. We glance at the\r\ncheerful fire, and hearken to the genial voices around us. We\r\nphilosophise, and struggle against the tokens of merriment without;\r\nbut the restraint is torture. We, too, must join the revellers, and\r\nhave a sleigh-ride. Girls, get on your fur; wrap yourselves up warmly\r\nin the old bear-skin; hunt up the old guitar; the sleigh is at the\r\ndoor, the moon is beaming. The bells tinkle and away we go!\r\n\r\nAn old English legend was transplanted many years ago on the shores of\r\nAmerica, that took root and flourished with wonderful luxuriance,\r\nconsidering it was not indigenous to the country. Probably it was\r\ntaken over to New York by one of the primitive Knickerbockers, or it\r\nmight have clung to some of the drowsy burgomasters who had forsaken\r\nthe pictorial tiles of dear old Amsterdam about the time of Peter de\r\nLaar, or Il Bombaccia, as the Italians call him, got into disgrace in\r\nRome. However this may be, certain it is that Santa Claus, or St.\r\nNicholas, the kind Patron-saint of the Juveniles, makes his annual\r\nappearance on Christmas Eve, for the purpose of dispensing gifts to\r\nall good children. This festive elf is supposed to be a queer little\r\ncreature that descends the chimney, viewlessly, in the deep hours of\r\nnight, laden with gifts and presents, which he bestows with no sparing\r\nhand, reserving to himself a supernatural discrimination that he seems\r\nto exercise with every satisfaction. Before going to bed the children\r\nhang their newest stockings near the chimney, or pin them to the\r\ncurtains of the bed. Midnight finds a world of hosiery waiting for\r\nfavours; and the only wonder is that a single Santa Claus can get\r\naround among them all. The story goes that he never misses one,\r\nprovided it belongs to a deserving youngster, and morning is sure to\r\nbring no reproach that the Christmas Wizard has not nobly performed\r\nhis wondrous duties. We need scarcely enlighten the reader as to who\r\nthe real Santa Claus is. Every indulgent parent contributes to the\r\npleasing deception, though the juveniles are strong in their faith of\r\ntheir generous holiday patron. The following favourite lines\r\ngraphically describe a visit of St. Nicholas, and, being in great\r\nvogue with the young people of America, are fondly reproduced from\r\nyear to year:--\r\n\r\n\"'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house,\r\n  Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;\r\n  The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,\r\n  In the hope that St. Nicholas soon would be there.\r\n  The children were nestled all snug in their beds,\r\n  While visions of sugar plums danced through their heads;\r\n  And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,\r\n  Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,\r\n  When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,\r\n  I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.\r\n  The way to the window, I flew like a flash,\r\n  Tore open the shutters, and threw up the sash;\r\n  The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow\r\n  Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below.\r\n  When what to my wondering eyes should appear\r\n  But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer;\r\n  With a little old driver, so lively and quick,\r\n  I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.\r\n  More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,\r\n  And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name--\r\n  Now Dasher! now Dancer! Now Prancer! now Vixen!\r\n  On Comet! on Cupid! on Donder and Blixen!\r\n  To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall!\r\n  Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!'\r\n  As the leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,\r\n  When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;\r\n  So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,\r\n  With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too.\r\n  And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof,\r\n  The prancing and pawing of each little hoof;\r\n  As I drew in my head and was turning around,\r\n  Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.\r\n  He was dressed all in furs from his head to his foot\r\n  And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.\r\n  A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,\r\n  And he looked like a pedlar just opening his pack.\r\n  His eyes, how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!\r\n  His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry;\r\n  His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,\r\n  And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.\r\n  The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,\r\n  And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.\r\n  He had a broad face and a little round belly\r\n  That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.\r\n  He was chubby and plump--a right jolly old elf;\r\n  And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.\r\n  A wink of his eye and a twist of his head\r\n  Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.\r\n  He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,\r\n  And filled all the stockings--then turned with a jerk,\r\n  And laying his finger aside of his nose,\r\n  And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;\r\n  He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,\r\n  And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.\r\n  But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,\r\n  'Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!'\"\r\n\r\nA curious feature of an American Christmas is the egg-nogg and free\r\nlunch, distributed at all the hotels and cafes. A week at least\r\nbefore the 25th fanciful signs are suspended over the fountains of the\r\nbars (the hotel-keepers are quite classic in their ideas) announcing\r\nsuperb lunch and egg-noggs on Christmas Day. This invitation is sure\r\nto meet with a large response from the amateur epicures about town,\r\nwho, ever on the _qui vive_ for a banquet gratis, flock to the festive\r\nstandard, since it has never been found a difficult matter to give\r\nthings away, from the time old Heliogabalus gastronomed in Phoenicia\r\nup to the present hour. A splendid hall in one of the principal\r\nhotels, at this moment, occurs to us. A table, the length of the\r\napartment, is spread and furnished with twenty made dishes peculiar to\r\nthe Christmas _cuisine_. There are _chorodens_ and _fricassees_,\r\n_ragouts_ and _calipee_, of rapturous delicacy. Each dish is labelled,\r\nand attended by a black servant, who serves its contents on very small\r\nwhite gilt-edged plates. At the head of the table a vast bowl,\r\nornamented with indescribable Chinese figures, contains the\r\negg-nogg--a palatable compound of milk, eggs, brandy, and spices,\r\nnankeenish in colour, with froth enough on its surface to generate any\r\nnumber of Venuses, if the old Peloponnesian anecdote is worth\r\nremembering at all. Over the egg-nogg mine host usually officiates,\r\nall smiles and benignity, pouring the rich draught with miraculous\r\ndexterity into cut-glass goblets, and passing it to the surrounding\r\nguests with profuse hand. On this occasion the long range of fancy\r\ndrinks are forgotten. Sherry-cobblers, mint-juleps, gin-slings, and\r\npunches, are set aside in order that the sway of the Christmas draught\r\nmay be supreme. Free lunches are extremely common in the United\r\nStates, what are called \"eleven o'clock snacks\" especially; but the\r\naccompaniment of egg-nogg belongs unequivocally to the death of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe presentation of \"boxes\" and souvenirs is the same in America as in\r\nEngland, the token of remembrance having an inseparable alliance with\r\nthe same period. Everybody expects to give and receive. A month before\r\nthe event the fancy stores are crowded all day long with old and young\r\nin search of suitable _souvenirs_, and every object is purchased, from\r\ncostliest gems to the tawdriest _babiole_ that may get into the\r\nmarket. If the weather should be fine, the principal streets are\r\nthronged with ladies shopping in sleighs; and hither and thither sleds\r\nshoot by, laden with parcels of painted toys, instruments of mock\r\nmusic and septuagenarian dread, from a penny trumpet to a sheepskin\r\ndrum.\r\n\r\nChristmas seems to be a popular period among the young folk for being\r\nmated, and a surprising number approach the altar this morning.\r\nWhether it is that orange-flowers and bridal gifts are admirably\r\nadapted to the time, or that a longer lease of happiness is ensured\r\nfrom the joyous character of the occasion, we are not sufficiently\r\nlearned in hymeneal lore to announce. The Christmas week, however, is\r\na merry one for the honeymoon, as little is thought of but mirth and\r\ngaiety until the dawning New Year soberly suggests that we should put\r\naside our masquerade manners.\r\n\r\nIn drawing-room amusements society has a wealth of pleasing indoor\r\npastimes. We remember the sententious Question _reunions_, the\r\nhilarious Surprise parties, Fairy-bowl, and Hunt-the-slipper. We can\r\nnever forget the vagabond Calathumpians, who employ in their bands\r\neverything inharmonious, from a fire-shovel to a stewpan, causing more\r\ndin than the demons down under the sea ever dreamed of.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, between the sleigh-rides, the bell-melodies, old Santa\r\nClaus and his fictions, the egg-nogg and lunches, the weddings and the\r\nwillingness to be entertained, the Americans find no difficulty in\r\nenjoying Christmas Day. Old forms and new notions come in for a share\r\nof observances; and the young country, in a glow of good humour, with\r\none voice exclaims, \"Le bon temps vienara!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT HARRISON AS \"SANTA CLAUS.\"\r\n\r\nWriting from New York on December 22, 1891, a correspondent says:\r\n\"President Harrison was seen by your correspondent at the White House\r\nyesterday, and was asked what he thought about Christmas and its\r\nreligious and social influences. The President expressed himself\r\nwilling to offer his opinions, and said: 'Christmas is the most sacred\r\nreligious festival of the year, and should be an occasion of general\r\nrejoicing throughout the land, from the humblest citizen to the\r\nhighest official, who, for the time being, should forget or put behind\r\nhim his cares and annoyances, and participate in the spirit of\r\nseasonable festivity. We intend to make it a happy day at the White\r\nHouse--all the members of my family, representing four generations,\r\nwill gather around the big table in the State dining-room to have an\r\nold-fashioned Christmas dinner. Besides Mrs. Harrison, there will be\r\nher father, Dr. Scott, Mr. and Mrs. M'Kee and their children, Mrs.\r\nDimmick and Lieutenant and Mrs. Parker. I am an ardent believer in the\r\nduty we owe to ourselves as Christians to make merry for children at\r\nChristmas time, and we shall have an old-fashioned Christmas tree for\r\nthe grandchildren upstairs; and I shall be their Santa Claus myself.\r\nIf my influence goes for aught in this busy world let me hope that my\r\nexample may be followed in every family in the land.'\r\n\r\n\"Christmas is made as much of in this country as it is in England, if\r\nnot more. The plum-pudding is not universal, but the Christmas tree is\r\nin almost every home. Even in the tenement districts of the East side,\r\ninhabited by the labouring and poorer classes, these vernal emblems of\r\nthe anniversary are quite as much in demand as in other quarters, and\r\nif they and the gifts hung upon them are less elaborate than their\r\nWest side congeners, the household enthusiasm which welcomes them is\r\nquite as marked. As in London, the streets are flooded with Christmas\r\nnumbers of the periodicals, which, it may be remarked, are this year\r\nmore elaborate in design and execution than ever. The use of Christmas\r\ncards has also obtained surprising proportions. A marked feature of\r\nthis year's Christmas is the variety and elegance of offerings after\r\nthe Paris fashion, which are of a purely ornamental and but slight\r\nutilitarian character. There are bonbonnieres in a variety of forms,\r\nsome of them very magnificent and expensive; while the Christmas cards\r\nrange in prices from a cent to ten dollars each. These bonbonnieres,\r\ndecked with expensive ribbon or hand-painted with designs of the\r\nseason, attain prices as high as forty dollars each, and are in great\r\nfavour among the wealthy classes. Flowers are also much used, and,\r\njust now, are exceedingly costly.\r\n\r\n\"While the usual religious ceremonies of the day are generally\r\nobserved here, the mass of the community are inclined to treat the\r\noccasion as a festive rather than a solemn occasion, and upon\r\nfestivity the whole population at the present time seems bent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"MERRY CHRISTMAS\" WITH THE NEGROES.\r\n\r\nA journalist who has been amongst the negroes in the Southern States\r\nof America thus describes their Christmas festivities:--\r\n\r\n\"Christmas in the South of the United States is a time-honoured\r\nholiday season, as ancient as the settlement of the Cavalier colonies\r\nthemselves. We may imagine it to have been imported from 'merrie\r\nEngland' by the large-hearted Papist, Lord Baltimore, into Maryland,\r\nand by that chivalric group of Virginian colonists, of whom the\r\ncentral historical figure is the famous Captain John Smith, of\r\nPocahontas memory. Perhaps Christmas was even the more heartily\r\ncelebrated among these true Papist and Church of England settlers from\r\nthe disgust which they felt at the stern contempt in which the Natal\r\nDay was held by 'stiff-necked Puritans' of New England. At least,\r\nwhile in New England the pilgrims were wont to work with exceptional\r\nmight on Christmas Day, to show their detestation of it, traditions\r\nare still extant of the jovial Southern merrymaking of the festival.\r\nChristmas, with many of the Old England customs imported to the new\r\nsoil, derived new spirit and enjoyment from customs which had their\r\norigin in the Colonies themselves. Above all was it the gala\r\nseason--the period to be looked forward to and revelled in--of the\r\nnegroes. Slavery, with all its horrors and wickedness, had at least\r\nsome genial features; and the latitude which the masters gave to the\r\nslaves at Christmas time, the freedom with which the blacks were wont\r\nto concentrate a year's enjoyment into the Christmas week, was one of\r\nthese. In Washington, where until the war slavery existed in a mild\r\nand more civilised form, the negro celebrations of Christmas were the\r\npeculiar and amusing feature of the season. And many of these customs,\r\nwhich grew up amid slavery, have survived that institution. The\r\nWashington negroes, free, have pretty much the same zest for their\r\ntime-honoured amusements which they had when under the dominion of the\r\noligarchy. Christmas is still their great gala and occasion for\r\nmerry-making, and the sable creatures thoroughly understand the art of\r\nhaving a good time, being superior, at least in this respect, to many\r\na _blase_ Prince and Court noble distracted with _ennui_. Those who\r\nhave seen the 'Minstrels' may derive some idea, though but a slight\r\none, of the negro pastimes and peculiarities. They are, above all, a\r\nsocial, enthusiastic, whole-souled race; they have their own ideas of\r\nrank and social caste, and they have a humour which is homely, but\r\nthoroughly genial, and quite the monopoly of their race. They insist\r\non the whole of Christmas week for a holiday. 'Missus' must manage how\r\nshe can. To insist on chaining them down in the kitchen during that\r\nhalcyon time would stir up blank rebellion. Dancing and music are\r\ntheir favourite Christmas recreations; they manage both with a will.\r\nIn the city suburbs there are many modest little frame-houses\r\ninhabited by the blacks; now and then a homely inn kept by a dusky\r\nlandlord. Here in Christmas time you will witness many jolly and\r\ninfectiously pleasant scenes. There is a 'sound of revelry by night.'\r\nYou are free to enter, and observe near by the countless gyrations of\r\nthe negro cotillon, the intricate and deftly executed jig, the rude\r\nmelody of banjos and 'cornstalk fiddles.' They are always proud to\r\nhave 'de white folks' for spectators and applauders, and will give\r\nyou the best seat, and will outdo themselves in their anxiety to show\r\noff at their best before you. You will be astonished to observe the\r\nscrupulous neatness of the men, the gaudy and ostentatious habiliments\r\nof 'de ladies.' The negroes have an intense ambition to imitate the\r\nupper classes of white society. They will study the apparel of a\r\nwell-dressed gentleman, and squander their money on 'swallow-tail'\r\ncoats, high dickeys, white neckties, and the most elaborate arts of\r\ntheir dusky barbers. The women are even more imitative of their\r\nmistresses. Ribbons, laces, and silks adorn them, on festive\r\noccasions, of the most painfully vivid colours, and fashioned in all\r\nthe extravagance of negro taste. Not less anxious are they to imitate\r\nthe manners of aristocracy. The excessive chivalry and overwhelming\r\npoliteness of the men towards the women is amazing. They make gallant\r\nspeeches in which they insert as many of the longest and most learned\r\nwords as they can master, picked up at random, and not always\r\npeculiarly adapted to the use made of them. Their excitement in the\r\ndance, and at the sound of music, grows as intense as does their furor\r\nin a Methodist revival meeting. They have, too, dances and music\r\npeculiar to themselves--jigs and country dances which seem to have no\r\nmethod, yet which are perfectly adapted to and rhythmic with the\r\ninspiring abrupt thud of the banjo and the bones. As they dance, they\r\nshout and sing, slap their hands and knees, and lose themselves in the\r\nenthusiasm of the moment. The negroes look forward to Christmas not\r\nless as the season for present-giving than that of frolicking and\r\njollity. Early in the morning they hasten upstairs, and catch 'massa'\r\nand 'missus' and 'de chillun' with a respectful but eager 'Merry\r\nChristmas,' and are sure to get in return a new coat or pair of boots,\r\na gingham dress, or ear-rings more showy than expensive. They have\r\nsaved up, too, a pittance from their wages, to expend in a souvenir\r\nfor 'Dinah' or 'Pompey,' the never-to-be-forgotten belle or\r\nsweetheart.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS IN FRANCE.\r\n\r\nThe following account of Christmas in France, in 1823, is given by an\r\nEnglish writer of the period:--\r\n\r\n\"The habits and customs of Parisians vary much from those of our own\r\nmetropolis at all times, but at no time more than at this festive\r\nseason. An Englishman in Paris, who had been for some time without\r\nreferring to his almanac, would not know Christmas Day from another\r\nday by the appearance of the capital. It is indeed set down as a _jour\r\nde fete_ in the calendar, but all the ordinary business life is\r\ntransacted; the streets are as usual, crowded with waggons and\r\ncoaches; the shops, with few exceptions, are open, although on other\r\n_fete_ days the order for closing them is rigorously enforced, and if\r\nnot attended to, a fine levied; and at the churches nothing\r\nextraordinary is going forward. All this is surprising in a Catholic\r\ncountry, which professes to pay much attention to the outward rites of\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\n\"On _Christmas Eve_, indeed, there is some bustle for a midnight mass,\r\nto which immense numbers flock, as the priests, on this occasion, get\r\nup a showy spectacle which rivals the theatres. The altars are dressed\r\nwith flowers, and the churches decorated profusely; but there is\r\nlittle in all this to please men who have been accustomed to the John\r\nBull mode of spending the evening. The good English habit of meeting\r\ntogether to forgive offences and injuries, and to cement\r\nreconciliations, is here unknown. The French listen to the Church\r\nmusic, and to the singing of their choirs, which is generally\r\nexcellent, but they know nothing of the origin of the day and of the\r\nduties which it imposes. The English residents in Paris, however, do\r\nnot forget our mode of celebrating this day. Acts of charity from the\r\nrich to the needy, religious attendance at church, and a full\r\nobservance of hospitable rites, are there witnessed. Paris furnishes\r\nall the requisites for a good pudding, and the turkeys are excellent,\r\nthough the beef is not to be displayed as a prize production.\r\n\r\n\"On _Christmas Day_ all the English cooks in Paris are in full\r\nbusiness. The queen of cooks, however, is Harriet Dunn, of the\r\nBoulevard. As Sir Astley Cooper among the cutters of limbs, and\r\nd'Egville among the cutters of capers, so is Harriet Dunn among the\r\nprofessors of one of the most necessary, and in its results most\r\ngratifying professions in existence; her services are secured\r\nbeforehand by special retainers; and happy is the peer who can point\r\nto his pudding, and declare that it is of the true Dunn composition.\r\nHer fame has even extended to the provinces. For some time previous to\r\nChristmas Day, she forwards puddings in cases to all parts of the\r\ncountry, ready cooked and fit for the table, after the necessary\r\nwarming. All this is, of course, for the English. No prejudice can be\r\nstronger than that of the French against plum-pudding--a Frenchman\r\nwill dress like an Englishman, swear like an Englishman, and get drunk\r\nlike an Englishman; but if you would offend him for ever compel him to\r\neat plum-pudding. A few of the leading restaurateurs, wishing to\r\nappear extraordinary, have _plomb-pooding_ upon their cartes, but in\r\nno instance is it ever ordered by a Frenchman. Everybody has heard the\r\nstory of St. Louis--Henri Qautre, or whoever else it might be--who,\r\nwishing to regale the English ambassador on Christmas Day with a\r\nplum-pudding, procured an excellent recipe for making one, which he\r\ngave to his cook, with strict injunctions that it should be prepared\r\nwith due attention to all particulars. The weight of the ingredients,\r\nthe size of the copper, the quantity of water, the duration of time,\r\neverything was attended to except one trifle--the king forgot the\r\ncloth, and the pudding was served up, like so much soup in immense\r\ntureens, to the surprise of the ambassador, who was, however, too well\r\nbred to express his astonishment. Louis XVIII., either to show his\r\ncontempt of the prejudices of his countrymen, or to keep up a custom\r\nwhich suits his palate, has always an enormous pudding on Christmas\r\nDay, the remains of which, when it leaves the table, he requires to be\r\neaten by the servants, _bon gre, mauvais gre_; but in this instance\r\neven the commands of sovereignty are disregarded, except by the\r\nnumerous English in his service, consisting of several valets, grooms,\r\ncoachmen, &c., besides a great number of ladies' maids in the service\r\nof the duchesses of Angouleme and Berri, who very frequently partake\r\nof the dainties of the king's table.\"\r\n\r\nIn his \"Year Book, 1832,\" Hone says that at Rouen, after the _Te\r\nDeum_, in the nocturnal office or vigil of Christmas, the\r\necclesiastics celebrated the \"office of the shepherds\" in the\r\nfollowing manner:--\r\n\r\n\"The image of the Virgin Mary was placed in a stable prepared behind\r\nthe altar. A boy from above, before the choir, in the likeness of an\r\nangel, announced the nativity to certain canons or vicars, who entered\r\nas shepherds through the great door of the choir, clothed in tunicks\r\nand amesses. Many boys in the vaults of the church, like angels, then\r\nbegan the '_gloria in excelsis_.' The shepherds, hearing this,\r\nadvanced to the stable, singing '_peace, goodwill_,' &c. As soon as\r\nthey entered it, two priests in dalmaticks, as if women (quasi\r\nobstetrices) who were stationed at the stable, said, 'Whom seek ye?'\r\nThe shepherds answered, according to the angelic annunciation, 'Our\r\nSaviour Christ.' The women then opening the curtain exhibited the boy,\r\nsaying, 'The little one is here as the Prophet Isaiah said.' They then\r\nshowed the mother, saying, 'Behold the Virgin,' &c. Upon these\r\nexhibitions they bowed and worshipped the boy, and saluted his mother.\r\nThe office ended by their returning to the choir, and singing,\r\nAlleluia, &c.\"[95]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS DAY IN BESIEGED PARIS.\r\n\r\n\"Christmas, Paris,\r\n\"_Sunday, Dec. 25, 1870, 98th day of the Siege._\r\n\r\n\"Never has a sadder Christmas dawned on any city. Cold, hunger, agony,\r\ngrief, and despair sit enthroned at every habitation in Paris. It is\r\nthe coldest day of the season and the fuel is very short; and the\r\ngovernment has had to take hold of the fuel question, and the\r\nmagnificent shade-trees that have for ages adorned the avenues of this\r\ncity are all likely to go in the vain struggle to save France. So says\r\nthe Official Journal of this morning. The sufferings of the past week\r\nexceed by far anything we have seen. There is scarcely any meat but\r\nhorse-meat, and the government is now rationing. It carries out its\r\nwork with impartiality. The omnibus-horse, the cab-horse, the\r\nwork-horse, and the fancy-horse, all go alike in the mournful\r\nprocession to the butchery shops--the magnificent blooded steed of the\r\nRothschilds by the side of the old plug of the cabman. Fresh beef,\r\nmutton, pork are now out of the question. A little poultry yet remains\r\nat fabulous prices. In walking through the Rue St. Lazare I saw a\r\nmiddling-sized goose and chicken for sale in a shop-window, and I had\r\nthe curiosity to step in and inquire the price (rash man that I was).\r\nThe price of the goose was $25, and the chicken $7.\"[96]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS IN PARIS IN 1886.\r\n\r\nThe Paris correspondent of the _Daily Telegraph_ writes:--\"Although\r\nNew Year's Day is the great French festival, the fashion of\r\ncelebrating Christmas something after the English custom is gaining\r\nground in Paris every year. Thus a good deal of mistletoe now makes\r\nits appearance on the boulevards and in the shop windows, and it is\r\nevident that the famous Druidical plant, which is shipped in such\r\nlarge quantities every year to England from Normandy and Brittany, is\r\nfast becoming popular among Parisians. Another custom, that of\r\ndecorating Christmas trees in the English and German style, has\r\nbecome quite an annual solemnity here since the influx of Alsatians\r\nand Lorrainers, while it is considered _chic_, in many quarters, to\r\neat approximate plum-pudding on the 25th of December. Unfortunately,\r\nthe Parisian 'blom budding,' unless prepared by British hands, is\r\ngenerally a concoction of culinary atrocities, tasting, let us say,\r\nlike saveloy soup and ginger-bread porridge. In a few instances the\r\n'Angleesh blom budding' has been served at French tables in a soup\r\ntureen; and guests have been known to direct fearful and furtive\r\nglances towards it, just as an Englishman might regard with mingled\r\nfeelings of surprise and suspicion a fricassee of frogs. But\r\nindependently of foreign innovations, Parisians have their own way of\r\ncelebrating Noel. To-night (Christmas Eve) for instance, there will be\r\nmidnight masses in the principal churches, when appropriate canticles\r\nand Adam's popular 'Noel' will be sung. In many private houses the\r\n_boudin_ will also be eaten after the midnight mass, the rich\r\nbaptising it in champagne, and the _petit bourgeois_, who has not a\r\nwine cellar, in a cheap concoction of bottled stuff with a Bordeaux\r\nlabel but a strong Paris flavour. The feast of Noel is, however, more\r\narchaically, and at the same time more earnestly, celebrated in\r\nprovincial France. In the south the head of the family kindles the\r\nyule-log, or _buche-de-Noel_, which is supposed to continue burning\r\nuntil the arrival of spring. Paterfamilias also lights the _calen_, or\r\nChristmas lamp, which represents the Star of Bethlehem, and then all\r\nrepair to the midnight mass in those picturesque groups which painters\r\nhave delighted to commit to canvas. The inevitable _baraques_, or\r\nbooths, which are allowed to remain on the great boulevards from\r\nChristmas Eve until the Feast of the Kings, on January 6, have made\r\ntheir appearance. They extend from the Place de la Madeleine to the\r\nPlace de la Republique, and are also visible on some of the other\r\nboulevards of the metropolis. Their glittering contents are the same\r\nas usual, and, despite their want of novelty, crowds of people lounged\r\nalong the boulevards this afternoon and inspected them with as much\r\ncuriosity as if they formed part of a Russian fair which had been\r\ntemporarily transported from Nijni Novgorod to Paris. What was more\r\nattractive, however, was the show of holly, mistletoe, fir-trees,\r\ncamellias, tea-roses, and tulips in the famous flower-market outside\r\nthe Madeleine. A large tent has been erected, which protects the\r\nsellers of winter flowers from the rain, and this gives the market a\r\ngayer and more brilliant appearance than usual. What strikes one more\r\nthan anything else, however, is the number of French people whom one\r\nsees purchasing holly bushes and mistletoe, which they carry home in\r\nhuge bundles, after the good old English fashion. Notwithstanding the\r\ndampness and gloom of the weather, which hovers between frost and\r\nrain, the general aspect of Paris to-day is one of cheerful and\r\npicturesque animation, and the laughing crowds with whom one jostles\r\nin the streets are thoroughly imbued with the festive character of the\r\nseason.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS IN NORMANDY.\r\n\r\nIn describing the old-custom-loving people of Lower Normandy, a writer\r\non \"Calvados,\" in 1884-5, thus refers to the season of Christmas and\r\nTwelfth-tide: \"Now Christmas arrives, and young and old go up to greet\r\nthe little child Jesus, lying on his bed of straw at the Virgin\r\nMother's feet and smiling to all the world. Overhead the old cracked\r\nbell clangs exultant, answering to other bells faint and far on the\r\nmidnight air; a hundred candles are burning and every church window\r\nshines through the darkness like the gates of that holy New Jerusalem\r\n'whose light was as a stone most precious--a jasper-stone clear as\r\ncrystal.' With Twelfth-tide this fair vision suffers a metamorphosis,\r\nblazoning out into the paganish saturnalia of bonfires, which in\r\nCalvados is transferred from St. John's Eve _le jour des Rois_. Red\r\nflames leap skyward, fed by dry pine fagots, and our erstwhile devout\r\npeasants, throwing moderation to the winds, join hands, dance, and\r\nleap for good luck through blinding smoke and embers, shouting their\r\nrude doggerel:\r\n\r\n\"'Adieu les Rois\r\n  Jusqu'a douze mois,\r\n  Douze mois passes\r\n  Les _bougelees_.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS IN PROVENCE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROVENCAL PLAYS AT CHRISTMASTIDE.]\r\n\r\nHeinrich Heine delighted in the infantile childishness of a Provencal\r\nChristmas. He never saw anything prettier in his life, he said, than a\r\nNoel procession on the coast of the Mediterranean. A beautiful young\r\nwoman and an equally lovely child sat on a donkey, which an old\r\nfisherman in a flowing brown gown was supposed to be leading into\r\nEgypt. Young girls robed in white muslin were supposed to be angels,\r\nand hovered near the child and its mother to supply to him sweetmeats\r\nand other refreshments. At a respectful distance there was a\r\nprocession of nuns and village children, and then a band of vocalists\r\nand instrumentalists. Flowers and streaming banners were unsparingly\r\nused. Bright sunshine played upon them, and the deep blue sea formed a\r\nbackground. The seafaring people who looked on, not knowing whether to\r\nvenerate or laugh, did both. Falling upon their knees they went\r\nthrough a short devotional exercise, and then rose to join the\r\nprocession and give themselves up to unrestricted mirth. In the\r\nchateaux of the South of France _creches_ are still exhibited, and\r\n_creche_ suppers given to the poorer neighbours, and to some of the\r\nrich, who are placed at a table \"above the salt.\" There are also\r\n\"Bethlehem Stable\" puppet-shows, at which the Holy Family, their\r\nvisitors, and four-footed associates are brought forward as _dramatis\r\npersonae_. St. Joseph, the wise men, and the shepherds are made to\r\nspeak in _patois_. But the Virgin says what she has to say in\r\nclassical French. In the refinement of her diction, her elevation\r\nabove those with her is expressed. At Marseilles an annual fair of\r\nstatuettes is held, the profits of which are spent in setting up\r\nBethlehem _creches_ in the churches and other places. Each statuette\r\nrepresents a contemporaneous celebrity, and is contained in the hollow\r\npart of the wax bust of some saint. Gambetta, Thiers, Cavour, Queen\r\nVictoria, Grevy, the Pope, Paul Bert, Rouvier (who is a Marseillais),\r\nthe late Czar and other celebrities have appeared among the\r\n_figurines_ hidden within the saintly busts.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS IN CORSICA.\r\n\r\n\"A Winter in Corsica,\" by \"Two Ladies,\" published in 1868, contains an\r\ninteresting account of the celebration of Christmas in that\r\npicturesque island of the Mediterranean which is known as the\r\nbirthplace of Napoleon Bonaparte--\"One day shortly before Christmas\r\nour hostess, or landlady, was very busy with an old body in the\r\nkitchen, who had come to make sundry cakes in preparation for that\r\nfestive season. We were all called down to see what was going on, and\r\nour attention was particularly directed to the great oven which was\r\nheated on purpose to bake them. One kind of cake was made of chesnut\r\nflour, another of eggs and _broche_ (a kind of curds made from goats'\r\nmilk), but the principal sort was composed chiefly of almonds,\r\nextremely good and not unlike macaroons, but thicker and more\r\nsubstantial. For several days previously, everybody in the house had\r\nbeen busy blanching and pounding almonds; not only the two servants,\r\nbut Rose and Clara, the young work-women who were so often staying in\r\nthe house, and who, indeed, at one time seemed to form part of the\r\nestablishment. The old cook herself, a stout and dumpy person, was\r\nworth looking at, as she stood surrounded by these young women, who\r\ndid very little but watch her operations; and the whole formed quite\r\nan animated picture of a foreign _menage_, which one rarely has the\r\nopportunity of seeing.\r\n\r\n*     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\"Towards Christmas, considerable preparations began to be made in the\r\nshops for the coming season, but chiefly, perhaps, for New Year's Day,\r\nwhich is kept throughout France as a grand _fete_ day. Sweetmeats in\r\ngreat variety filled the windows, and especially what were called\r\n_pralines_--an almond comfit covered with rough sugar, and of a\r\npeculiar flavour. They are very good, and cost three francs per pound.\r\n\r\n*     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\"It seemed strange writing to friends at home wishing them 'a happy\r\nChristmas,' when we seemed scarcely to have done with summer.\r\n\r\n\"There was certainly a good deal of novelty in our mode of passing\r\nChristmas-time in Ajaccio.\r\n\r\n\"We had expressed the wish to be present at midnight mass, in the\r\ncathedral, on Christmas Eve, and our kind hostess readily promised to\r\ntake us, and also said we should have a _petit souper_ with her on our\r\nreturn. She told us afterwards that she had spoken to the organist,\r\nand obtained permission for us to go into the organ-loft, where we\r\nshould have a good view over the church, and not be inconvenienced by\r\nthe crowd. Accordingly, a little before eleven o'clock, we all went\r\ndownstairs, and, accompanied by madame, as well as by a gentleman and\r\nhis daughter, friends of hers, proceeded to the cathedral.\r\n\r\n\"As there is no gas in Ajaccio, the church of course is lighted only\r\nwith candles, and very dim and gloomy it looked, especially at first,\r\nand during a dull monotonous kind of chanting, which we were told were\r\nthe offices to the Virgin.\r\n\r\n\"By and by, as midnight drew near, and the mass was about to commence,\r\na great number of candles were lighted on the high altar and in the\r\nside chapels, and the scene became more brilliant and animated. We\r\nlooked down upon a perfect sea of heads, the women all wearing the\r\nnational handkerchiefs, many of these of bright colours, and making\r\nthem conspicuous among the men, of whom there were also a very large\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\n\"At length the organ struck up, the higher priests entered, wearing\r\ntheir richest robes, followed by numerous attendants. Each bowed and\r\nknelt as he passed the altar, and took his allotted place, and then\r\nthe service began. At one point, supposed to be the moment of our\r\nSaviour's birth, there was quite an uproar. The people clapped their\r\nhands, and stamped, and shouted, trumpets sounded, and the organ\r\npealed forth its loudest tones.\r\n\r\n\"Then there was a very sweet hymn-tune played, and some beautiful\r\nvoices sang Adeste Fideles, which was by far the most pleasing part of\r\nthe service to our minds. Next came the reading of the Gospel, with\r\nmuch formality of kissing and bowing, and incensing; the book was\r\nmoved from side to side and from place to place; then one priest on\r\nhis knees held it up above his head, while another, sitting, read a\r\nshort passage, and a third came forward to the front of the enclosed\r\nspace near the altar, flinging the censer round and about. Then the\r\nlittle bell tinkled, and all that mass of heads bowed down lower, the\r\nHost was raised, the communion taken by the priests, and at one\r\no'clock all was over.\r\n\r\n\"We gladly regained the fresh air, which, though rather cold, was much\r\nneeded after the close atmosphere of the crowded cathedral. The moon\r\nwas very bright, and we hastened home with appetites sharpened by our\r\nwalk, for what proved to be a handsome dinner, rather than a _petit\r\nsouper_.\r\n\r\n*     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\"For ourselves, we did not forget the old home custom of Christmas\r\ndecorations, and took some pains to dress our _salon_ with evergreens,\r\nwhich we brought down from the hills the previous day. Although we had\r\nneither holly nor mistletoe, we found good substitutes for them in the\r\nelegant-leaved lentiscus, the tree heath and sweetly perfumed myrtle;\r\nwhile round the mirror and a picture of the Virgin on the opposite\r\nwall we twined garlands of the graceful sarsaparilla. The whole looked\r\nextremely pretty, and gave quite a festive appearance to the room.\r\n\r\n\"On Christmas Day we joined some English friends for a walk, about\r\neleven o'clock. It was a charming morning, bright and hot, as we\r\nstrolled along the shore to the orange-garden of Barbacaja, where we\r\ngathered oranges fresh from the trees.\r\n\r\n\"On returning home to dinner no plum-pudding or mince-pies awaited us\r\ncertainly, but we had tolerably good beef, for a wonder, and lamb,\r\n_merles_, and new potatoes.\r\n\r\n*     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\"Christmas Day in Corsica is observed by the people as a religious\r\nfestival, but not as a social one; and there are no family gatherings\r\nas in England and Germany. This arises, no doubt, from that\r\nnon-existence of true domestic life which must strike all English\r\ntaking up a temporary residence in France.\r\n\r\n\"There was a succession of _fete_ days throughout Christmas week, when\r\nthe shops were shut and the people dressed in holiday attire. But the\r\ngreat day to which every one seems to look forward is the first of the\r\nyear, _le Jour de l'An_. Presents are then made by everybody to\r\neverybody, and visits of congratulation, or merely of ceremony,\r\nreceived and expected. The gifts are sometimes costly and handsome,\r\nbut generally they are trifling, merely valuable as works of\r\nremembrance, consisting chiefly of bonbons, boxes of crystallised\r\nfruits, and other confectionery.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS IN CHIOS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From an ivory, Byzantine. British Museum ]\r\n\r\nThe preceding illustration of Eastern art belongs to the same period\r\nas many of the Christmas customs which have survived in Chios, and it\r\ncarries our thoughts back to the time when Byzantium was the capital\r\nof the Greek Empire in the east. From an interesting account by an\r\nEnglish writer in the _Cornhill Magazine_, for December, 1886, who\r\nspent a Christmas amongst the Greeks of this once prosperous isle of\r\nChios, it appears that, two days before Christmas, he took up his\r\nquarters at \"the village of St. George, a good day's journey from the\r\ntown, on the slopes of a backbone of mountains, which divides Chios\r\nfrom north to south.\" On the morning following the arrival at St.\r\nGeorge, \"echoes of home\" were heard which caused the writer to\r\nexclaim: \"Surely they don't have Christmas waits here.\" Outside the\r\nhouse stood a crowd of children singing songs and carrying baskets.\r\nFrom the window, the mistress of the house was seen standing amongst\r\nthe children \"talking hard, and putting handfuls of something into\r\neach basket out of a bag.\" \"On descending,\" says the writer, \"I\r\ninquired the cause of this early invasion, and learnt that it is\r\ncustomary on the day before Christmas for children to go round to the\r\nhouses of the village early, before the celebration of the liturgy,\r\nand collect what is called 'the luck of Christ'--that is to say,\r\nwalnuts, almonds, figs, raisins, and the like. Every housewife is\r\ncareful to have a large stock of these things ready overnight, and if\r\nchildren come after her stock is exhausted she says, 'Christ has taken\r\nthem and passed by.' The urchins, who are not always willing to accept\r\nthis excuse, revile her with uncomplimentary remarks, and wish her\r\ncloven feet, and other disagreeable things.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer visited the chief inhabitants of St. George, and was\r\nregaled with \"spoonfuls of jam, cups of coffee, and glasses of mastic\r\nliquer\"; and, in a farmyard, \"saw oxen with scarlet horns,\" it being\r\nthe custom, on the day before Christmas, for \"every man to kill his\r\npig, and if he has cattle to anoint their horns with blood, thereby\r\nsecuring their health for the coming year.\r\n\r\n\"It is very interesting to see the birthplace of our own Christmas\r\ncustoms here in Greece, for it is an undoubted fact that all we see\r\nnow in Greek islands has survived since Byzantine days. Turkish rule\r\nhas in no way interfered with religious observances, and during four\r\nor five centuries of isolation from the civilised world the\r\nconservative spirit of the East has preserved intact for us customs as\r\nthey were in the early days of Christianity; inasmuch as the Eastern\r\nChurch was the first Christian Church, it was the parent of all\r\nChristian customs. Many of these customs were mere adaptations of the\r\npagan to the Christian ceremonial--a necessary measure, doubtless, at\r\na time when a new religion was forced on a deeply superstitious\r\npopulation. The saints of the Christian took the place of the gods of\r\nthe \"Iliad.\" Old customs attending religious observances have been\r\npeculiarly tenacious in these islands, and here it is that we must\r\nlook for the pedigree of our own quaint Christian habits. We have seen\r\nthe children of St. George collecting their Christmas-boxes, we have\r\nspoken of pig-killing, and we will now introduce ourselves to Chiote\r\nChristmas-trees, the _rhamnae_, as they are called here, which take the\r\nform of an offering of fruits of the earth and flowers by tenants to\r\ntheir landlords.\r\n\r\n\"The form of these offerings is varied: one tenant we saw chose to\r\nmake his in the shape of a tripod; others merely adorn poles, but all\r\nof them effect this decoration in a similar fashion, more gaudily than\r\nartistically. The pole is over a yard in height, and around it are\r\nbound wreaths of myrtle, olive, and orange leaves; to these are fixed\r\nany flowers that may be found, geraniums, anemones, and the like, and,\r\nby way of further decoration, oranges, lemons, and strips of gold and\r\ncoloured paper are added.\r\n\r\n\"On Christmas morning the tenants of the numerous gardens of Chios\r\nproceed to the houses of their landlords, riding on mules and carrying\r\na _rhamna_ in front of them and a pair of fowls behind. As many as\r\nthree hundred of these may be seen entering the capital of Chios on\r\nthis day, and I was told the sight is very imposing. At St. George we\r\nhad not so many of them, but sufficient for our purpose. On reaching\r\nhis landlord's house the peasant sets up the trophy in the outer room,\r\nto be admired by all who come; the fowls he hands over to the\r\nhousewife; and then he takes the large family jars or _amphorae_, as\r\nthey still call them, to the well, and draws the drinking water for\r\nhis landlord's Christmas necessities.\r\n\r\n\"In the afternoon each landlord gives 'a table' to his tenants, a good\r\nsubstantial meal, at which many healths are drunk, compliments\r\nexchanged, and songs sung, and before returning home each man receives\r\na present of money in return for his offerings. A Greek never gives a\r\npresent without expecting an equivalent in return.\"\r\n\r\nAnother Christmas custom in Chios which reminded the writer of the\r\nEnglish custom of carol-singing is thus described: \"There are five\r\nparishes in the village of St. George, each supplied with a church,\r\npriests, acolytes, and candle-lighters, who answer to our vergers, and\r\nwho are responsible for the lighting of the many lamps and candles\r\nwhich adorn an Eastern church. These good people assemble together on\r\nChristmas Day, after the liturgy is over, and form what is called 'a\r\nmusical company'; one man is secured to play the lyre, another the\r\nharp, another the cymbals, and another leads the singing--if the\r\nmonotonous chanting in which they indulge can be dignified by the\r\ntitle of singing. The candle-lighter, armed with a brass tray, is the\r\nrecognised leader of this musical company, and all day long he\r\nconducts them from one house to another in the parish to play, sing,\r\nand collect alms. These musicians of St. George have far more\r\nconsideration for the feelings of their fellow-creatures than English\r\ncarol-singers, for the candle-lighter is always sent on ahead to\r\ninquire of the household they propose to visit if there is mourning in\r\nthe house, or any other valid reason why the musicians should not\r\nplay, in which case the candle-lighter merely presents his tray,\r\nreceives his offering, and passes on. Never, if they can help it, will\r\na family refuse admission to the musicians. They have not many\r\namusements, poor things, and their Christmas entertainment pleases\r\nthem vastly.\r\n\r\n\"The carols of these islands are exceedingly old-world and quaint.\r\nWhen permission is given the troupe advance towards the door, singing\r\na sort of greeting as follows: 'Come now and open your gates to our\r\nparty; we have one or two sweet words to sing to you.' The door is\r\nthen opened by the master of the house; he greets them and begs them\r\nto come in, whilst the other members of the family place chairs at one\r\nend of the room, on which the musicians seat themselves. The first\r\ncarol is a genuine Christmas one, a sort of religious recognition of\r\nthe occasion, according to our notions fraught with a frivolity almost\r\nbordering on blasphemy; but then it must be remembered that these\r\npeasants have formed their own simple ideas of the life of Christ, the\r\nVirgin, and the saints, to which they have given utterance in their\r\nsongs. A priest of St. George kindly supplied me with the words of\r\nsome of their carols, and this is a translation of one of the\r\nprefatory songs with which the musical company commence:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'Christmas, Christmas! Christ is born;\r\n  Saints rejoice and devils mourn.\r\n  Christmas, Christmas! Christ was fed\r\n  On sweet honey, milk, and bread,\r\n  Just as now our rulers eat\r\n  Bread and milk, and honey sweet.'\r\n\r\nAfter this the company sing a series of songs addressed to the various\r\nmembers of the family, to the father, to the mother, to the daughters,\r\nto the sons; if there chances to be a betrothed couple there, they are\r\nsure to be greeted with a special song; the little children, too, are\r\nexhorted in song to be good and diligent at school. Of these songs\r\nthere are an infinite number, and many of them give us curious\r\nglimpses into the life, not of to-day, but of ages which have long\r\nsince passed away.\r\n\r\n\"The following song is addressed to the master of the house, and has\r\ndoubtless been sung for centuries of Christmases since the old\r\nByzantine days when such things as are mentioned in the song really\r\nexisted in the houses. This is a word-for-word translation:--\r\n\r\n\"'We have come to our venerable master;\r\n  To his lofty house with marble halls.\r\n  His walls are decorated with mosaic;\r\n  With the lathe his doors are turned.\r\n  Angels and archangels are around his windows,\r\n  And in the midst of his house is spread a golden carpet\r\n  And from the ceiling the golden chandelier sheds light.\r\n  It lights the guests as they come and go.\r\n  It lights our venerable master.'\r\n\r\nOn the conclusion of their carols the musicians pause for rest, the\r\ncymbal-player throws his cymbal on the floor, and the candle-lighter\r\ndoes the same thing with his tray, and into these the master of the\r\nhouse deposits his gifts to his parish church, and if they are a\r\nnewly-married couple they tie up presents of food for the musicians in\r\na handkerchief--figs, almonds, &c., which the cymbal-player fastens\r\nround his neck or ties to his girdle.\r\n\r\n\"Before the musicians take their departure the housewife hurries off\r\nto her cupboard and produces a tray with the inevitable jam thereon.\r\nCoffee and mastic are served, and the compliments of the season are\r\nexchanged. Whilst the candle-lighter is absent looking for another\r\nhouse at which to sing, the musicians sing their farewell, 'We wish\r\nhealth to your family, and health to yourself. We go to join the\r\n_pallicari_.'\r\n\r\n\"In villages where the singing of carols has fallen into disuse the\r\ninhabitants are content with the priestly blessing only. To distribute\r\nthis the priest of each parish starts off on Christmas morning with\r\nthe candle-lighter and his tray, and an acolyte to wave the censer; he\r\nblesses the shops, he sprinkles holy water over the commodities, and\r\nthen he does the same by the houses; the smell of incense perfumes the\r\nair, and the candle-lighter rattles his tray ostentatiously to show\r\nwhat a lot of coppers he has got.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS IN A GREEK CHURCH.\r\n\r\n\"Swan's Journal of a Voyage up the Mediterranean, 1826,\" gives the\r\nfollowing account of Christmas in a Greek Church:--\r\n\r\n\"Thursday, January 6th, this being Christmas Day with the Greek\r\nCatholics, their 'churches are adorned in the gayest manner. I entered\r\none, in which a sort of raree-show had been set up, illumed with a\r\nmultitude of candles: the subject of it was the birth of Christ, who\r\nwas represented in the background by a little waxen figure wrapped up\r\nin embroidery, and reclining upon an embroidered cushion, which rested\r\nupon another of pink satin. This was supposed to be the manger where\r\nhe was born. Behind the image two paper bulls' heads looked\r\nunutterable things. On the right was the Virgin Mary, and on the left\r\none of the eastern Magi. Paper clouds, in which the paper heads of\r\nnumberless cherubs appeared, enveloped the whole; while from a\r\npasteboard cottage stalked a wooden monk, with dogs, and sheep, and\r\ncamels, goats, lions, and lambs; here walked a maiden upon a stratum\r\nof sods and dried earth, and there a shepherd flourishing aloft his\r\npastoral staff. The construction of these august figures was chiefly\r\nDutch: they were intermixed with china images and miserable daubs on\r\npaper. In the centre a real fountain, in miniature, squirted forth\r\nwater to the ineffable delight of crowds of prostrate worshippers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS IN ROME.\r\n\r\nHone[97] states that after Christmas Day, during the remainder of\r\nDecember, there is a Presepio, or representation of the manger, in\r\nwhich our Saviour was laid, to be seen in many of the churches at\r\nRome. That of the Ara Coeli is the best worth seeing, which church\r\noccupies the site of the temple of Jupiter, and is adorned with some\r\nof its beautiful pillars. On entering, we found daylight completely\r\nexcluded from the church; and until we advanced, we did not perceive\r\nthe artificial light, which was so managed as to stream in fluctuating\r\nrays, from intervening silvery clouds, and shed a radiance over the\r\nlovely babe and bending mother, who, in the most graceful attitude,\r\nlightly holds up the drapery which half conceals her sleeping infant\r\nfrom the bystanders. He lies in richly embroidered swaddling clothes,\r\nand his person, as well as that of his virgin mother, is ornamented\r\nwith diamonds and other precious stones; for which purpose, we are\r\ninformed, the princesses and ladies of high rank lend their jewels.\r\nGroups of cattle grazing, peasantry engaged in different occupations,\r\nand other objects, enliven the picturesque scenery; every living\r\ncreature in the group, with eyes directed towards the Presepio, falls\r\nprostrate in adoration. In the front of this theatrical representation\r\na little girl, about six or eight years old, stood on a bench,\r\npreaching extempore, as it appeared, to the persons who filled the\r\nchurch, with all the gesticulation of a little actress, probably in\r\ncommemoration of those words of the psalmist, quoted by our blessed\r\nLord--\"Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings Thou hast perfected\r\npraise.\" In this manner the Scriptures are _acted_; not \"read, marked,\r\nand inwardly digested.\" The whole scene had, however, a striking\r\neffect, well calculated to work upon the minds of a people whose\r\nreligion consists so largely in outward show. [From \"A Narrative of\r\nThree Years in Italy.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALABRIAN SHEPHERDS PLAYING IN ROME AT CHRISTMAS.\r\n(_From Hone's \"Every-day Book_,\" 1826)]\r\n\r\nAs at the beginning, so in the latter part of the nineteenth century,\r\nthe church celebrations of Christmas continue to be great Christmas\r\nattractions in the Eternal City.\r\n\r\nFrom the description of one who was present at the Christmas\r\ncelebration of 1883, we quote the following extracts:--\r\n\r\n\"On Christmas morning, at ten o'clock, when all the world was not only\r\nawake, but up and doing, mass was being said and sung in the principal\r\nchurches, but the great string of visitors to the Imperial City bent\r\ntheir steps towards St. Peter's to witness the celebration of this the\r\ngreatest feast in the greatest Christian Church.\r\n\r\n\"As the heavy leather curtain which hangs before the door fell behind\r\none, this sacred building seemed indeed the world's cathedral; for\r\nhere were various crowds from various nations, and men and women\r\nfollowers of all forms of faiths, and men and women of no faith at\r\nall. The great church was full of light and colour--of light that came\r\nin broad yellow beams through the great dome and the high eastern\r\nwindows, making the candles on the side altars and the hundred\r\never-burning lamps around the St. Peter's shrine look dim and yellow\r\nin the fulness of its radiance; and of colour combined of friezes of\r\nburnished gold, and brilliant frescoes, and rich altar pieces, and\r\nbronze statues, and slabs of oriental alabaster, and blocks of red\r\nporphyry and lapis lazuli, and guilded vaulted ceiling, and walls of\r\ninlaid marbles.\r\n\r\n\"In the large choir chapel, containing the tomb of Clement IX., three\r\nsuccessive High Masses were celebrated, the full choir of St. Peter's\r\nattending. In the handsomely carved old oak stalls sat bishops in\r\npurple and rich lace, canons in white, and minor canons in grey fur\r\ncapes, priests and deacons, and a hundred acolytes wearing\r\nsilver-buckled shoes and surplices. This chapel, with its life-size\r\nmarble figures resting on the cornices, has two organs, and here the\r\nchoicest music is frequently heard.\r\n\r\n\"Of course the choir chapel was much too small to hold the great\r\ncrowd, which, therefore, overflowed into the aisles and nave of the\r\nvast church, where the music could be heard likewise. This crowd broke\r\nup into groups, each worthy of a study, and all combining to afford an\r\neffect at once strange and picturesque. There are groups of Americans,\r\nEnglish, French, Germans, and Italians promenading round the church,\r\ntalking in their respective native tongues, gesticulating, and now and\r\nthen pausing to admire a picture or examine a statue. Acquaintances\r\nmeet and greet; friends introduce mutual friends; compliments are\r\nexchanged, and appointments made. Meanwhile masses are being said at\r\nall the side altars, which are surrounded by knots of people who fall\r\non their knees at the sound of a little bell, and say their prayers\r\nquite undisturbed by the general murmur going on around them.\r\n\r\n\"Presently there is a stir in the crowd surrounding the choir chapel;\r\nthe organ is at its loudest, and then comes a long procession of\r\nvergers in purple and scarlet facings, and cross and torch bearers,\r\nand censer bearers, and acolytes and deacons and priests and canons\r\nand bishops, and a red-robed cardinal in vestments of cloth of gold\r\nwrought and figured with many a sacred sign, and, moreover, adorned\r\nwith precious stones; and High Mass at St. Peter's, on Christmas Day,\r\nis at an end.\r\n\r\n\"During the day most of the shops and all the Government offices were\r\nopen. Soldiers were drilled all day long in the Piazza Vittorio\r\nEmanuele, and were formally marched to their various barracks, headed\r\nby bands discoursing martial music; whilst the postmen delivered their\r\nfreight of letters as on ordinary days of the week. In the afternoon\r\nmost of those who were at St. Peter's in the morning assembled to hear\r\nGrand Vespers at the handsome and famous church of San Maria Maggiore,\r\none of the oldest in Christendom, the Mosaics on the chancel arch\r\ndating from the fifth century. The church was illuminated with\r\nhundreds of candles and hung with scarlet drapery, the effect being\r\nvery fine; the music such as can alone be heard in Rome. On the high\r\naltar was exhibited in a massive case of gold and crystal two staves\r\nsaid to have been taken from the manger in which Christ was laid, this\r\nbeing carried round the church at the conclusion of Vespers. Almost\r\nevery English visitor in Rome was present.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS AT MONTE CARLO.\r\n\r\n\"Every one has heard of the tiny principality of Monaco, with its six\r\nsquare miles of territory facing the Mediterranean, and lying below\r\nthe wonderful Corniche-road, which has been for ages the great highway\r\nsouth of the Alps, connecting the South of France with Northern Italy.\r\nOf course many visitors come here to gamble, but an increasing number\r\nare attracted by the beauty of the scenery and the charm of the\r\nclimate; and here some hundreds of Englishmen and Englishwomen spent\r\ntheir Christmas Day and ate the conventional plum-pudding. Christmas\r\nhad been ushered in by a salvo of artillery and a High Mass at the\r\ncathedral at eleven on Christmas Eve, and holly and mistletoe (which\r\nseemed strangely out of place amongst the yellow roses and hedges of\r\ngeraniums) were in many hands. As illustrating the mildness of the\r\nclimate and the natural beauty of the district, the following flowers\r\nwere in full bloom in the open air on Christmas Day: roses of every\r\nvariety, geraniums, primulas, heliotropes, carnations, anemones,\r\nnarcissus, sweetwilliams, stocks, cactus, and pinks; and to these may\r\nbe added lemon trees and orange trees laden with their golden fruit.\r\nAs evening wore on a strong gale burst upon the shore, and Christmas\r\nDay closed amongst waving foliage and clanging doors and clouds of\r\ndust, and the fierce thud of angry surf upon the sea-shore below.\r\n\r\n\"January 2, 1890.

B.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS EVE FESTIVITIES IN GERMANY.\r\n\r\nIn \"The German Christmas Eve,\" 1846, Madame Apolline Flohr recalls her\r\n\"childish recollections\" of the Christmas festivities in the \"happy\r\nfamily\" of which she was a member. They met amid the glare of a\r\nhundred lights, and according to an old-established custom, they soon\r\njoined in chaunting the simple hymn which begins:--\r\n\r\n \"Now let us thank our God;\r\n    Uplift our hands and hearts:\r\n  Eternal be His praise,\r\n    Who all good things imparts!\"\r\n\r\nAfter the singing (says the writer), I ventured for the first time, to\r\napproach the pile of Christmas gifts intended for my sisters, my\r\nbrothers, and myself.\r\n\r\nThe Christmas tree, always the common property of the children of the\r\nhouse, bore gilded fruits of every species; and as we gazed with\r\nchildish delight on these sparkling treasures our dear parents wiped\r\naway the tears they had plentifully shed, while our young voices were\r\nringing out the sweet hymn, led by our friend, Herr Von Clappart, with\r\nsuch deep and solemn emotion.\r\n\r\nNow, as the dear mother led each child to his or her own little\r\ntable--for the gifts for each were laid out separately, and thus\r\napportioned beforehand--all was joy and merriment.\r\n\r\nA large table stood in the midst, surrounded by smaller ones,\r\nliterally laden with pretty and ingenious toys, the gifts of friends\r\nand kindred. We liked the toys very much indeed. We were, however, too\r\nhappy to endure quiet pleasure very long, and all prepared to assemble\r\naround the Christmas tree. After a delightful dance around the tree,\r\nand around our dear parents, our presents were again examined; for the\r\nvariety of offerings made on these occasions would much exceed the\r\nbelief of a stranger to our customs. Every article for children's\r\nclothing was here to be found, both for ornament and use; nor were\r\nbooks forgotten. It was then I received my first Bible and\r\nPrayer-book; and at the moment the precious gift was placed in my\r\nhand, I resolved to accompany my parents to church the following\r\nmorning at five o'clock. (This early attendance at public worship on\r\nChristmas morning is a custom observed in Central Germany, and is\r\ncalled Christ-Kirche.)\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of withdrawing, in order to attire ourselves in some of\r\nour new dresses, having been performed, we re-entered the apartment,\r\nupon which the great folding-doors being thrown open, a second\r\nChristmas tree appeared, laden with hundreds of lights. This effect\r\nwas produced by the tree being placed opposite some large\r\nlooking-glasses, which reflected the lights and redoubled their\r\nbrilliancy.\r\n\r\nHere hung the gifts prepared by the hands of the children for their\r\nbeloved parents.\r\n\r\nMy eldest sister, Charlotte, had knitted for her mother a beautiful\r\nevening cap, and a long purse for her father.\r\n\r\nEmily presented each one of the family with a pair of mittens; and the\r\nlittle Adolphine made similar offerings of open-worked stockings, her\r\nfirst attempt.\r\n\r\nOur parents were also surprised and delighted to receive some\r\ndrawings, exceedingly well executed, by my brothers, accompanied by a\r\nletter of thanks from those dear boys, for the kind permission to take\r\nlessons which had been granted to them during the last half-year.\r\n\r\nThe great bell had called us together at five o'clock in the\r\nafternoon, to receive our Christmas gifts; and though at eleven our\r\neyes and hearts were still wide awake, yet were we obliged to retire,\r\nand leave all these objects of delight behind us. All remembered that,\r\nat least, the elder branches of the family must rise betimes the next\r\nmorning to attend the Christ-Kirche, and to hear a sermon on the birth\r\nof the Saviour of Mankind.\r\n\r\nThe great excitement of the previous evening, and the vision of\r\ndelight that still hovered around my fancy, prevented my sleeping\r\nsoundly; so that when the others were attempting to steal away the\r\nnext morning to go to church, I was fully roused, and implored so\r\nearnestly to be taken with the rest of the family, that at length my\r\nprayer was granted; but on condition that I should keep perfectly\r\nstill during the service.\r\n\r\nArrived at the church we found it brilliantly illuminated, and\r\ndecorated with the boughs of the holly and other evergreens.\r\n\r\nIt is quite certain that a child of five years old could not\r\nunderstand the importance, beauty, and extreme fitness of the sublime\r\nservice she so often witnessed in after life; yet I can recollect a\r\npeculiarly sweet, sacred, and mysterious feeling taking possession of\r\nme, as my infant mind received the one simple impression that this was\r\nthe birthday of the Saviour I had been taught to love and pray to,\r\nsince my infant lips could lisp a word.\r\n\r\nSince early impressions are likely to be permanent, it is considered\r\nmost important in my fatherland to surround, Christmas with all joyous\r\nand holy associations. A day of days, indeed, it is with us--a day\r\nnever to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nSo far is this feeling carried, that it is no uncommon pastime, even\r\nat the beginning of the new year, to project plans and presents, happy\r\nsurprises, and unlooked-for offerings, to be presented at the far-off\r\ntime of Christmas festivity.\r\n\r\n*     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAnother writer, at the latter end of the nineteenth century, gives the\r\nfollowing account of the Christmas festivities at the German Court,\r\nfrom which it appears that the long-cherished Christmas customs are\r\nwell preserved in the highest circle in Germany:--\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS AT THE GERMAN COURT.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with an old custom the Royal Family of Prussia celebrate\r\nChristmas in a private manner at the Emperor William's palace, where\r\nthe \"blue dining-hall\" on the first floor is arranged as the Christmas\r\nroom. Two long rows of tables are placed in this hall, and two smaller\r\ntables stand in the corners on either side of the pillared door\r\nleading to the ballroom. On these tables stand twelve of the finest\r\nand tallest fir-trees, reaching nearly to the ceiling, and covered\r\nwith innumerable white wax candles placed in wire-holders, but without\r\nany other decoration.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of the 24th great packages are brought into this room\r\ncontaining the presents for the members of the Imperial household, and\r\nin the presence of the Emperor his Chamberlain distributes them on the\r\ntables under the trees. The monarch always takes an active part in\r\nthis work, and, walking about briskly from one table to the other,\r\nhelps to place the objects in the most advantageous positions, and\r\nfastens on them slips of white paper on which he himself has written\r\nthe names of the recipients. The Empress is also present, occupied\r\nwith arranging the presents for the ladies of her own household. The\r\ntwo separate tables still remain empty, until the Emperor and the\r\nEmpress have left the room, as they are destined to hold the presents\r\nfor their Majesties.\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock the entire Royal Family assemble in the large\r\ndining-hall of the Palace for their Christmas dinner. Besides all the\r\nPrinces and Princesses without exception, the members of the Imperial\r\nhousehold, the chiefs of the Emperor's military and civil Cabinets,\r\nand a number of adjutants are also present.\r\n\r\nShortly after the termination of the dinner the double doors leading\r\nto the blue hall are thrown wide open at a sign from the Emperor, and\r\nthe brilliant sight of the twelve great fir-trees bearing thousands of\r\nlighted tapers is disclosed to view. This is the great moment of the\r\nGerman Christmas Eve celebration. The Imperial couples then form in\r\nprocession, and all proceed to the Christmas room. The Emperor and the\r\nEmpress then personally lead the members of their households to the\r\npresents which are grouped in long rows on the tables, and which\r\ncomprise hundreds of articles, both valuable and useful, objects of\r\nart, pictures, statuary, &c. Meanwhile, the two separate tables still\r\nremain hidden under white draperies. In other rooms all the officials\r\nand servants of the palace, down to the youngest stable-boy, are\r\npresented with their Christmas-boxes. At about nine o'clock the\r\nImperial Family and their guests again return to the dining-room,\r\nwhere a plain supper is then served. According to old tradition, the\r\nmenu always includes the following dishes: \"Carp cooked in beer\" (a\r\nPolish custom), and \"Mohnpielen,\" an East Prussian dish, composed of\r\npoppy-seed, white bread, almonds and raisins, stewed in milk. After\r\nthe supper all return once more to the Christmas room, where the\r\nsecond part of the celebration--the exchange of presents among the\r\nRoyal Family--then comes off.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's table stands on the right side of the ballroom door, and\r\nevery object placed on it bears a paper with an inscription intimating\r\nby whom the present is given. The presents for the Empress on the\r\nother table are arranged in the same manner. Among the objects never\r\nmissing at the Emperor's Christmas are some large Nuremberg ginger\r\ncakes, with the inscription \"Weihnachten\" and the year. About\r\nhalf-an-hour later tea is taken, and this terminates the Christmas Eve\r\nof the first family of the German Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS THROUGHOUT GERMANY,\r\n\r\nit may be added, is similarly observed in the year 1900. From the\r\nImperial palace to the poor man's cottage there is not a family in\r\nGermany that has not its Christmas tree and \"Weihnachts\r\nBescheerung\"--Christmas distribution of presents. For the very poor\r\ndistricts of Berlin provision is made by the municipal authorities or\r\ncharitable societies to give the children this form of amusement,\r\nwhich they look forward to throughout the year.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTMAS FESTIVITIES IN AUSTRIA\r\n\r\nare similar to those in Germany, the prominent feature being the\r\nbeautifully-adorned and splendidly-lighted Christmas-tree. At one of\r\nthese celebrations, a few years ago, the numerous presents received by\r\nthe young Princess Elizabeth included a speaking doll, fitted with a\r\nphonograph cylinder, which created no small astonishment. Among other\r\nthings, the doll was able to recite a poem composed by the Archduchess\r\nMarie Valerie in honour of Christmas Eve.\r\n\r\nThe poor and destitute of Vienna are not forgotten, for, in addition\r\nto the Christmas-tree which is set up at the palace for them, a large\r\nnumber of charitable associations in the various districts of Vienna\r\nhave also Christmas-trees laden with presents for the poor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS EVE IN ST. MARK'S, VENICE.\r\n\r\nYou go into the Duomo late on Christmas Eve, and find the time-stained\r\nalabasters and dark aisles lit up with five hundreds of wax candles\r\nover seven feet high. The massive silver lamps suspended across the\r\nchoir have the inner lamps all ablaze, as is also the graceful\r\nByzantine chandelier in the centre of the nave that glitters like a\r\ncluster of stars from dozens of tiny glass cups with wick and oil\r\nwithin. In the solemn and mysterious gloom you pass figures of men and\r\nwomen kneeling in devotion before the many shrines. Some are\r\naccompanied by well-behaved and discreet dogs, who sit patiently\r\nwaiting till their owners' prayer shall be over; whilst others less\r\nwell trained, run about from group to group to smell out their friends\r\nor growl at foes. You slowly work your way through the throng to the\r\nhigh altar. That unique reredos, brought from Constantinople in early\r\ntimes--the magnificent \"Pala d'Ora,\" an enamelled work wrought on\r\nplates of gold and silver, and studded with precious stones--is\r\nunveiled, and the front of the altar has a rich frontispiece of the\r\nthirteenth century, which is of silver washed with gold, and embossed\r\nfigures. Numbers of ponderous candles throw a glimmer over the\r\ntreasures with which St. Mark's is so richly endowed, that are\r\nprofusely displayed on the altar. Bishops, canons and priests in full\r\ndress are standing and kneeling, and the handsome and much-beloved\r\nPatriarch of Venice officiates, in dress of gorgeous scarlet and\r\ncream-coloured old lace, and heavy-brocaded cope, that is afterwards\r\nexchanged for one of ermine, and flashing rings and jewelled cross.\r\nThere is no music, but a deep quiet pervades the dim golden domes\r\noverhead and the faintly-lighted transepts. Stray rays of light catch\r\nthe smooth surface of the mosaics, which throw off sparkles of\r\nbrightness and cast deeper shadows beyond the uncertain radiance.\r\nAfter the midnight mass is celebrated you pass out with the stream of\r\npeople into the cold, frosty night, with only the bright stars to\r\nguide you through the silent alleys to your rooms, where you wish each\r\nother \"A Merry Christmas!\" and retire to sleep, and to dream of the\r\nold home in England.--_Queen_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SASSOFERRATO (GIOVANNI BATTISTA SALVI) 1605-85\r\nmuseum naples]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS IN NAPLES.\r\n\r\nAn English writer who spent a Christmas in Naples a few\r\nyears ago, says:--\r\n\r\n\"In the south Christmas is bright and gay, and in truth noisy. The\r\n_festa natalizie_, as it is called in Naples, is celebrated by fairs\r\nand bonfires and fireworks. In the Toledo, that famous street known\r\nto all the world, booths are erected beside the shops, flaming in\r\ncolour, and filled with all sorts of tempting wares. Throughout\r\nChristmas Eve an immense crowd of men, women, and children throng this\r\nstreet, nearly a mile in length. The vendors shriek at the top of\r\ntheir voice, praising themselves and their goods, and then, with merry\r\npeals of laughter, exhibit with Neapolitan drollery all the arts of\r\ntheir trade. The crowd catch the contagious spirit of fun, and toss\r\nwitticisms to and fro, until the welkin rings with shouts and\r\nlaughter. A revolution in Paris could not create greater excitement,\r\nor greater noise, than the Christmas fair at Naples, the largest, and\r\ncertainly the merriest, in the world. As night draws on the mirth\r\ngrows uproarious; improvisations abound. Pulcinello attracts laughing\r\ncrowds. The bagpipes strike with their ear-piercing sounds, and arise\r\nshrill above the universal din. Fireworks are let off at every street\r\ncorner, flaming torches carried in procession parade the streets;\r\nrockets rise in the air, coloured lamps are hung over doorways, and in\r\nthe midst of the blaze of light the church bells announce the midnight\r\nMass, and the crowd leave the fair and the streets, and on bended knee\r\nare worshipping.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Luis de Vargas 1502-1568 Seville Cathedral]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS IN SPAIN.\r\n\r\nSpain in winter must be divided into Spain the frigid and Spain the\r\nsemi-tropic; for while snow lies a foot deep at Christmas in the\r\nnorth, in the south the sun is shining brightly, and flowers of spring\r\nare peeping out, and a nosegay of heliotrope and open-air geraniums is\r\nthe Christmas-holly and mistletoe of Andalusia. There is no chill in\r\nthe air, there is no frost on the window-pane.\r\n\r\nWhen Christmas Eve comes the two days' holiday commences. At twelve\r\nthe labourers leave their work, repair home, and dress in their best.\r\nThen the shops are all ablaze with lights, ribbons and streamers, with\r\ntempting fare of sweets and sausages, with red and yellow serge to\r\nmake warm petticoats; with cymbals, drums, and _zambombas_. The chief\r\nsweetmeats, peculiar to Christmas, and bought alike by rich and poor,\r\nare the various kinds of preserved fruits, incrusted with sugar, and\r\nthe famous _turrni_. This last, which is of four kinds, and may be\r\ncalled in English phraseology, \"almond rock,\" is brought to your door,\r\nand buy it you must. A coarse kind is sold to the poor at a cheap\r\nrate. Other comestibles, peculiar to Christmas, are almond soup,\r\ntruffled turkey, roasted chestnuts, and nuts of every sort.\r\n\r\nBefore the _Noche-buena_, or Christmas Eve, however, one or two good\r\ndeeds have been done by the civil and military authorities. On the\r\ntwenty-third or twenty-fourth the custom is for the military governor\r\nto visit all the soldier prisoners, in company with their respective\r\ndefensores, or advocates; and, _de officio_, there and then, he\r\nliberates all who are in gaol for light offences. This plan is also\r\npursued in the civil prisons; and thus a beautiful custom is kept up\r\nin classic, romantic, Old-world Spain, and a ray of hope enters into\r\nand illuminates even the bitter darkness of a Spanish prisoners' den.\r\n\r\nIt is Christmas Eve. The poor man has his relations round him, over\r\nhis humble _puchero_ (stew): the rich man likewise. _Friends_ have not\r\ncome, \"for it is not the custom.\" In Spain only blood relations eat\r\nand drink in the house as invited guests. Families meet as in England.\r\nTwo per cent. of the soldiers get a fortnight's leave of absence and a\r\nfree pass; and there is joy in peasant homes over peasant charcoal\r\npans. The dusky shades of evening are stealing over olive grove and\r\nwithering vineyard, and every house lights up its tiny oil lamp, and\r\nevery image of the Virgin is illuminated with a taper. In Eija, near\r\nCordova, an image or portrait of the Virgin and the Babe new-born,\r\nhangs in well-nigh every room in every house. And why? Because the\r\nbeautiful belief is rooted in those simple minds, that, on Christmas\r\nEve, ere the clock strikes twelve, the Virgin, bringing blessings in\r\nher train, visits every house where she can find an image or portrait\r\nof _her Son_. And many a girl kneels down in robes of white before her\r\nhumble portrait of the Babe and prays; and hears a rustle in the room,\r\nand thinks, \"the Virgin comes: she brings me my Christmas Eve\r\nblessing;\" and turns, and lo! it is _her mother_, and the Virgin's\r\nblessing is the mother's kiss!\r\n\r\nIn Northern Andalusia you have the _zambomba_, a flower-pot perforated\r\nby a hollow reed, which, wetted and rubbed with the finger, gives out\r\na hollow, scraping, monotonous sound. In Southern Andalusia the\r\n_panderita_, or tambourine, is the chief instrument. It is wreathed\r\nwith gaudy ribbons, and decked with bells, and beaten, shaken, and\r\ntossed in the air with graceful abandon to the strains of the\r\nChristmas hymn:\r\n\r\n \"This night is the good night,\r\n  And therefore is no night of rest!\"\r\n\r\nOr, perhaps, the Church chant is sung, called \"The child of God was\r\nborn.\"\r\n\r\nThen also men click the castanet in wine-shop and cottage; and in such\r\nold-world towns as Eija, where no railway has penetrated, a\r\nbreast-plate of eccentrically strung bones--slung round the neck and\r\nplayed with sticks--is still seen and heard.\r\n\r\nThe turkeys have been slaughtered and are smoking on the fire. The\r\nnight is drawing on and now the meal is over. Twelve o'clock strikes,\r\nand in one moment every bell from every belfrey clangs out its\r\nsummons. Poltroon were he who had gone to bed before twelve on\r\n_Noche-buena_. From every house the inmates hurry to the gaily-lit\r\nchurch and throng its aisles, a dark-robed crowd of worshippers. The\r\norgan peals out, the priests and choir chant at this midnight hour the\r\nChristmas hymn, and at last (in some out-of-the-way towns) the\r\npriests, in gaudiest robes, bring out from under the altar and expose\r\naloft to the crowds, in swaddling-clothes of gold and white, the Babe\r\nnew-born, and all fall down and cross themselves in mute adoration.\r\nThis service is universal, and is called the \"Misa del Gallo,\" or\r\nCock-crow Mass, and even in Madrid it is customary to attend it. There\r\nare three masses also on Christmas Day, and the Church rule, strictly\r\nobserved, is that if a man fail to attend this Midnight Mass he must,\r\nto save his religious character, attend all three on Christmas Day. In\r\nantique towns, like Eija, there are two days' early mass (called \"Misa\r\ndi Luz\") anterior to the \"Misa del Gallo,\" at 4 a.m., and in the raw\r\nmorning the churches are thronged with rich and poor. In that strange,\r\nold-world town, also, the chief dame goes to the Midnight Mass, all\r\nher men-servants in procession before her, each playing a different\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nChristmas Eve is over. It is 1.30 a.m. on Christmas morning, and the\r\ncrowds, orderly, devout, cheerful, are wending their way home. Then\r\nall is hushed; all have sought repose; there are no drunken riots; the\r\ndark streets are lit by the tiny oil lamps; the watchman's monotonous\r\ncry alone is heard, \"Ave Maria purissima; las dos; y sereno.\"\r\n\r\nThe three masses at the churches on Christmas Day are all chanted to\r\njoyous music. Then the poor come in to pay their rent of turkeys,\r\npigs, olives, or what not, to their landlord, and he gives them a\r\nChristmas-box: such as a piece of salt fish, or money, or what may be.\r\nThen, when you enter your house, you will find on your table, with the\r\nheading, \"A Happy Christmas,\" a book of little leaflets, printed with\r\nverses. These are the petitions of the postman, scavenger, telegraph\r\nman, newsboy, &c., asking you for a Christmas-box. Poor fellows! they\r\nget little enough, and a couple of francs is well bestowed on them\r\nonce a year. After mid-day breakfast or luncheon is over, rich and\r\npoor walk out and take the air, and a gaudy, pompous crowd they form\r\nas a rule. As regards presents at Christmas, the rule is, in primitive\r\nSpain, to send a present to the _Cura_ (parish priest) and the doctor.\r\nMany Spaniards pay a fixed annual sum to their medical man, and he\r\nattends all the family, including servants. His salary is sent to him\r\nat Christmas, with the addition of a turkey, or a cake, or some fine\r\nsweetmeats.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Eve the provincial hospitals present one of their most\r\nstriking aspects to the visitor. It is a feast-day, and instead of the\r\nusual stew, the soup called _caldo_--and very weak stuff it is--or the\r\nstir-about and fried bread, the sick have their good sound meats,\r\ncooked in savoury and most approved fashion, their tumbler of wine,\r\ntheir extra cigar. Visitors, kindly Spanish ladies, come in, their\r\nhands laden with sweets and tobacco, &c., and the sight of the black\r\nsilk dresses trailing over the lowly hospital couches is most human\r\nand pathetic. At last _night_--the veritable Christmas Eve comes. The\r\nchapels in these hospitals are generally on the ground floor, and\r\nfrequently sunk some feet below it, but open to the hospital; so that\r\nthe poor inmates who can leave their beds can hobble to the railing\r\nand look down into the chapel--one mass of dazzling lights, glitter,\r\ncolour, and music: and thus, without the fatigue of descending the\r\nstairs, can join in the service. At half-past eleven at night the\r\nchapel is gaily lit up; carriage after carriage, mule-cart after\r\nmule-cart rattles up to the hospital door, discharging crowds of\r\nladies and gentlemen in evening dress; thus the common people, chiefly\r\nthe young, with their tambourines and zambombas, pour into the chapel\r\nfrom _Campo_, and alley, and street, and soon the chapel is filled;\r\nwhile above, sitting, hobbling, lying all round the rails, and gazing\r\ndown upon the motley and noisy throng below, are the inmates of the\r\nhospital. The priest begins the Midnight Mass, and the organs take up\r\nthe service, the whole of which, for one hour, is chanted. Meanwhile,\r\nthe tambourines and other musical instruments are busy, and join in\r\nthe strains of the organ; and the din, glitter, and excitement are\r\nmost exhilarating. And thus the occupants of the Spanish provincial\r\nhospitals join in the festivities of Christmastide, as seen by one\r\nwho has dwelt \"_Among the Spanish People_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS CUSTOMS IN NORWAY.\r\n\r\nA writer who knows the manners and habits of the people of Norway, and\r\ntheir customs at Christmastide, says:--\r\n\r\n\"At Christiania, and other Norwegian towns, there is, or used to be, a\r\ndelicate Christmas custom of offering to a lady a brooch or a pair of\r\nearings in a truss of hay. The house-door of the person to be\r\ncomplimented is pushed open, and there is thrown into the house a\r\ntruss of hay or straw, a sheaf of corn, or a bag of chaff. In some\r\npart of this \"bottle of hay\" envelope, there is a \"needle\" as a\r\npresent to be hunted for. A friend of mine once received from her\r\nbetrothed, according to the Christmas custom, an exceedingly large\r\nbrown paper parcel, which, on being opened, revealed a second parcel\r\nwith a loving motto on the cover. And so on, parcel within parcel,\r\nmotto within motto, till the kernel of this paper husk--which was at\r\nlength discovered to be a delicate piece of minute jewellery--was\r\narrived at.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the prettiest of Christmas customs is the Norwegian practice of\r\ngiving, on Christmas Day, a dinner to the birds. On Christmas morning\r\nevery gable, gateway, or barn-door, is decorated with a sheaf of corn\r\nfixed on the top of a tall pole, wherefrom it is intended that the\r\nbirds should make their Christmas dinner. Even the peasants contrive\r\nto have a handful set by for this purpose, and what the birds do not\r\neat on Christmas Day, remains for them to finish at their leisure\r\nduring the winter.\r\n\r\nOn New Year's Day in Norway, friends and acquaintances exchange calls\r\nand good wishes. In the corner of each reception-room is placed a\r\nlittle table, furnished all through the day with wine and cakes for\r\nthe refreshment of the visitors; who talk, and compliment, and flirt,\r\nand sip wine, and nibble cake from house to house, with great\r\nperseverance.\r\n\r\nBetween Christmas and Twelfth Day mummers are in season. They are\r\ncalled \"Julebukker,\" or Christmas goblins. They invariably appear\r\nafter dark, and in masks and fancy dresses. A host may therefore have\r\nto entertain in the course of the season, a Punch, Mephistopheles,\r\nCharlemagne, Number, Nip, Gustavus, Oberon, and whole companies of\r\nother fanciful and historic characters; but, as their antics are\r\nperformed in silence, they are not particularly cheerful company.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS IN RUSSIA.\r\n\r\nWith Christmas Eve begins the festive season known in Russia as\r\n_Svyatki_ or _Svyatuie Vechera_ (Holy Evenings), which lasts till the\r\nEpiphany. The numerous sportive ceremonies which are associated with\r\nit resemble, in many respects, those with which we are familiar, but\r\nthey are rendered specially interesting and valuable by the relics of\r\nthe past which they have been the means of preserving--the fragments\r\nof ritual song which refer to the ancient paganism of the land, the\r\ntime-honoured customs which originally belonged to the feasts with\r\nwhich the heathen Slavs greeted each year the return of the sun. On\r\nChristmas Eve commences the singing of the songs called _Kolyadki_, a\r\nword, generally supposed to be akin to _Kalendae_, though reference is\r\nmade in some of them to a mysterious being, apparently a solar\r\ngoddess, named Kolyada. \"Kolyada, Kolyada! Kolyada has come. We\r\nwandered about, we sought holy Kolyada in all the courtyards,\"\r\ncommences one of these old songs, for many a year, no doubt, solemnly\r\nsung by the young people who used in olden times to escort from\r\nhomestead to homestead a sledge in which sat a girl dressed in white,\r\nwho represented the benignant goddess. Nowadays these songs have in\r\nmany places fallen into disuse, or are kept up only by the children\r\nwho go from house to house, to congratulate the inhabitants on the\r\narrival of Christmas, and to wish them a prosperous New Year. In every\r\nhome, says one of these archaic poems, are three inner chambers. In\r\none is the bright moon, in another the red sun, in a third many stars.\r\nThe bright moon--that is the master of the house; the red sun--that is\r\nthe housewife; the many stars--they are the little children.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Church sternly sets its face against the old customs with\r\nwhich the Christmas season was associated, denouncing the \"fiendish\r\nsongs,\" and \"devilish games,\" the \"graceless talk,\" the \"nocturnal\r\ngambols,\" and the various kinds of divination in which the faithful\r\npersisted in indulging. But, although repressed, they were not to be\r\ndestroyed, and at various seasons of the year, but especially those of\r\nthe summer and winter solstice, the \"orthodox,\" in spite of their\r\npastors, made merry with old heathenish sports, and, after listening\r\nto Christian psalms in church, went home and sang songs framed by\r\ntheir ancestors in honour of heathen divinities. Thus century after\r\ncentury went by, and the fortunes of Russia underwent great changes.\r\nBut still in the villages were the old customs kept up, and when\r\nChristmas Day came round it was greeted by survivals of the ceremonies\r\nwith which the ancient Slavs hailed the returning sun god, who caused\r\nthe days to lengthen, and filled the minds of men with hopes of a new\r\nyear rich in fruits and grain. One of the customs to which the Church\r\nmost strongly objected was that of mumming. As in other lands, so in\r\nRussia it was customary for mummers to go about at Christmastide,\r\nvisiting various homes in which the festivities of the season were\r\nbeing kept up, and there dancing, and performing all kinds of antics.\r\nProminent parts were always played by human representatives of a goat\r\nand a bear. Some of the party would be disguised as \"Lazaruses,\" that\r\nis, as the blind beggars who bear that name, and whose plaintive\r\nstrains have resounded all over Russia from the earliest times to the\r\npresent day. The rest disguised themselves as they best could, a\r\ncertain number of them being generally supposed to play the part of\r\nthieves desirous to break in and steal. When, after a time, they were\r\nadmitted into the room where the Christmas guests were assembled, the\r\ngoat and the bear would dance a merry round together, the Lazaruses\r\nwould sing their \"dumps so dull and heavy,\" and the rest of the\r\nperformers would exert themselves to produce exhilaration. Even among\r\nthe upper classes it was long the custom at this time of year for the\r\nyoung people to dress up and visit their neighbours in disguise. Thus\r\nin Count Tolstoy's \"Peace and War,\" a novel which aims at giving a\r\ntrue account of the Russia of the early part of the present century,\r\nthere is a charming description of a visit of this kind paid by the\r\nyounger members of one family to another. On a bright frosty night the\r\nsledges are suddenly ordered, and the young people dress up, and away\r\nthey drive across the crackling snow to a country house six miles off,\r\nall the actors creating a great sensation, but especially the fair\r\nmaiden Sonya, who proves irresistible when clad in her cousin's hussar\r\nuniform and adorned with an elegant moustache. Such mummers as these\r\nwould lay aside their disguises with a light conscience, but the\r\npeasant was apt to feel a depressing qualm when the sports were over;\r\nand it is said that, even at the present day, there are rustics who do\r\nnot venture to go to church, after having taken part in a mumming,\r\nuntil they have washed off their guilt by immersing themselves in the\r\nbenumbing waters of an ice-hole.\r\n\r\nNext to the mumming, what the Church most objected to was the\r\ndivination always practised at Christmas festivals. With one of its\r\nforms a number of songs have been associated, termed _podblyudnuiya_,\r\nas connected with a _blyudo_, a dish or bowl. Into some vessel of this\r\nkind the young people drop tokens. A cloth is then thrown over it, and\r\nthe various objects are drawn out, one after another, to the sound of\r\nsongs, from the tenor of which the owners deduce omens relative to\r\ntheir future happiness. As bread and salt are also thrown into the\r\nbowl, the ceremony may be supposed to have originally partaken of the\r\nnature of a sacrifice. After these songs are over ought to come the\r\ngame known as the \"burial of the gold.\" The last ring remaining in the\r\nprophetic bowl is taken out by one of the girls, who keeps it\r\nconcealed in her hand. The others sit in a circle, resting their hands\r\non their knees. She walks slowly round, while the first four lines are\r\nsung in chorus of the song beginning, \"See here, gold I bury, I bury.\"\r\nThen she slips the ring into one of their hands, from which it is\r\nrapidly passed on to another, the song being continued the while. When\r\nit comes to an end the \"gold burier\" must try to guess in whose hand\r\nthe ring is concealed. This game is a poetical form of our \"hunt the\r\nslipper.\" Like many other Slavonic customs it is by some archaeologists\r\ntraced home to Greece. By certain mythologists the \"gold\" is supposed\r\nto be an emblem of the sun, long hidden by envious wintry clouds, but\r\nat this time of year beginning to prolong the hours of daylight. To\r\nthe sun really refer, in all probability, the bonfires with which\r\nChristmastide, as well as the New Year and Midsummer is greeted in\r\nRussia. In the Ukraine the sweepings from a cottage are carefully\r\npreserved from Christmas Day to New Year's Day, and are then burnt in\r\na garden at sunrise. Among some of the Slavs, such as the Servians,\r\nCroatians, and Dalmatians, a _badnyak_, or piece of wood answering to\r\nthe northern Yule-log, is solemnly burnt on Christmas Eve. But the\r\nsignificance originally attached to these practices has long been\r\nforgotten. Thus the grave attempts of olden times to search the\r\nsecrets of futurity have degenerated into the sportive guesses of\r\nyoung people, who half believe that they may learn from omens at\r\nChristmas time what manner of marriages are in store for them.\r\nDivinings of this kind are known to all lands, and bear a strong\r\nfamily likeness; but it is, of course, only in a cold country that a\r\nspinster can find an opportunity of sitting beside a hole cut in the\r\nsurface of a frozen river, listening to prophetic sounds proceeding\r\nfrom beneath the ice, and possibly seeing the image of the husband who\r\nshe is to marry within the year trembling in the freezing water.\r\nThroughout the whole period of the _Svyatki_, the idea of marriage\r\nprobably keeps possession of the minds of many Russian maidens, and on\r\nthe eve of the Epiphany, the feast with which those Christmas holidays\r\ncome to an end, it is still said to be the custom for the village\r\ngirls to go out into the open air and to beseech the \"stars, stars,\r\ndear little stars,\" to be so benignant as to\r\n\r\n \"Send forth through the christened world\r\n  Arrangers of weddings.\"\r\n\r\nW. R. S. Ralston, in _Notes and Queries_, Dec. 21, 1878.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS-KEEPING IN AFRICA.\r\n\r\n\"A certain young man about town\" (says _Chambers's Journal_, December\r\n25, 1869), \"once forsook the sweet shady side of Pall Mall for the\r\nsake of smoking his cigar in savage Africa; but when Christmas came,\r\nhe was seized with a desire to spend it in Christian company, and this\r\nis how he did spend it: 'We English once possessed the Senegal; and\r\nthere, every Christmas Eve, the Feast of Lanterns used to be held. The\r\nnative women picked up the words and airs of the carols; the custom\r\nhad descended to the Gambia, and even to the Casemanche, where it is\r\nstill preserved. A few minutes after I had ridden up, sounds of music\r\nwere heard, and a crowd of blacks came to the door, carrying the model\r\nof a ship made of paper, and illuminated within; and hollowed pumpkins\r\nalso lighted up for the occasion. Then they sang some of our dear old\r\nChristmas carols, and among others, one which I had heard years ago\r\non Christmas Eve at Oxford:\r\n\r\n  Nowel, Nowel, the angels did say,\r\n  To certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay--\r\n  In fields as they lay keeping their sheep,\r\n  One cold winter's night, which was so deep.\r\n          Nowel, Nowel, Nowel, Nowel,\r\n          Born is the King of Israel.\r\n\r\nYou can imagine with what feelings I listened to those simple words,\r\nsung by negresses who knew not a phrase of English besides. You can\r\nimagine what recollections they called up, as I sat under an African\r\nsky, the palm-trees rustling above my head, and the crocodiles moaning\r\nin the river beyond. I thought of the snow lying thick upon the\r\nground; of the keen, clear, frosty air. I thought of the ruddy fire\r\nwhich would be blazing in a room I knew; and of those young faces\r\nwhich would be beaming still more brightly by its side; I thought\r\nof--oh, of a hundred things, which I can laugh at now, because I am in\r\nEngland, but which, in Africa, made me more wretched than I can well\r\nexpress.'\r\n\r\n\"Next day, sadness and sentiment gave way, for a while at least, to\r\nmore prosaical feelings. When Mr. Reade sat down to his Christmas\r\ndinner, he must have wished, with Macbeth, 'May good digestion wait on\r\nappetite,' as he contemplated the fare awaiting discussion, and to\r\nwhich a boar's head grinned a welcome. Snails from France, oysters\r\ntorn from trees, gazelle cutlets, stewed iguana, smoked elephant,\r\nfried locusts, manati-breasts, hippopotamus steaks, boiled alligator,\r\nroasted crocodile eggs, monkeys on toast, land crabs and Africa soles,\r\ncarp, and mullet--detestable in themselves, but triumphant proof of\r\nthe skill of the cook--furnished forth the festival-table, in company\r\nwith potatoes, plantains, pine-apples, oranges, papaws, bananas, and\r\nvarious fruits rejoicing in extraordinary shapes, long native names,\r\nand very nasty flavours; and last, but not least, palm-cabbage stewed\r\nin white sauce, 'the ambrosia of the gods,' and a bottle of good\r\nBordeaux at every's man's elbow. When evening came, Mr. Reade and a\r\nspecial friend sought the river: 'The rosy wine had rouged our yellow\r\ncheeks, and we lay back on the cushions, and watched the setting sun\r\nwith languid, half-closed eyes. Four men, who might have served as\r\nmodels to Appelles, bent slowly to their stroke, and murmured forth a\r\nsweet and plaintive song. Their oars, obedient to their voice, rippled\r\nthe still water, and dropped from their blades pearls, which the sun\r\nmade rubies with its rays. Two beautiful girls, who sat before us in\r\nthe bow, raised their rounded arms and tinkled their bracelets in the\r\nair. Then, gliding into the water, they brought us flowers from\r\nbeneath the dark bushes, and kissed the hands which took them, with\r\nwet and laughing lips. Like a dark curtain, the warm night fell upon\r\nus; strange cries roused from the forest; beasts of the waters plunged\r\naround us, and my honest friend's hand pressed mine. And Christmas\r\nDay was over. We might seek long for a stranger contrast to an\r\nEnglishman's Christmas at home, although--to adapt some seasonable\r\nlines--\r\n\r\n                                Where'er\r\n  An English heart exists to do and dare,\r\n  Where, amid Afric's sands, the lion roars,\r\n  Where endless winter chains the silent shores,\r\n  Where smiles the sea round coral islets bright,\r\n  Where Brahma's temple's sleep in glowing light--\r\n  In every spot where England's sons may roam,\r\n  Dear Christmas-tide still speaks to them of Home!\"\r\n\r\n    [93] The discovery of the North-West Passage for\r\n    navigation from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific, by the\r\n    northern coasts of the American continent; first\r\n    successfully traversed by Sir R.

C. Lomax's Successors\r\nLichfield_)]\r\n\r\nChristmas carols have been sung at Lichfield from long before the time\r\nof \"the mighty Offa,\" King of the Mercians, in whose days and by whose\r\ninfluence Lichfield became for a time an archiepiscopal see, being\r\nelevated to that dignity by Pope Adrian, in 785. And, in the\r\nseventeenth century, the Deanery of Lichfield was conferred upon the\r\nRev. Griffin Higgs, the writer of the events connected with the\r\nexhibition of \"The Christmas Prince\" at St. John's College, Oxford, in\r\n1607, whose authentic account of these interesting historical events\r\nwill be found in an earlier chapter of this work.\r\n\r\nThe Christmas carols at Lichfield Cathedral, sung by the full choir at\r\nthe special evening service on St. Stephen's Day (December 26th),\r\nhave, for many years, attracted large and appreciative congregations,\r\nand the last of these celebrations in the nineteenth century (on\r\nDecember 26, 1900) was well sustained by the singers and attended by\r\nmany hundreds of citizens and visitors. Eight Christmas Carols and an\r\nanthem were sung, the concluding Carol being \"The First Nowell\"; and\r\nthe organist (Mr. J. B. Lott, Mus. Bac., Oxon) played the Pastoral\r\nSymphony from Sullivan's \"Light of the World,\" Mendelssohn's March\r\n(\"Cornelius\"), the Pastoral Symphony from Handel's \"Messiah,\" and\r\nother exquisite voluntaries. From the anthem, E. H. Sears's beautiful\r\nverses beginning\r\n\r\n \"It came upon the midnight clear,\r\n  That glorious song of old,\"\r\n\r\nset to Stainer's music and well sung, we quote the concluding\r\npredictive stanza:\r\n\r\n \"For lo, the days are hast'ning on,\r\n    By prophet-bards foretold,\r\n  When with the ever-circling years\r\n    Comes round the age of gold;\r\n  When peace shall over all the earth\r\n    Its ancient splendours fling,\r\n  And the whole world give back the song\r\n    Which now the angels sing.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nAbbot of
