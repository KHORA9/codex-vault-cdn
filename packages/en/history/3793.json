AND HIS COURT\r\n\r\nMARIA THERESA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE CONFERENCE.\r\n\r\nIn the council-chamber of the Empress Maria Theresa, the six lords, who\r\ncomposed her cabinet council, awaited the entrance of their imperial\r\nmistress to open the sitting.\r\n\r\nAt this sitting, a great political question was to be discussed and its\r\ngravity seemed to be reflected in the faces of the lords, as, in low\r\ntones, they whispered together in the dim, spacious apartment, whose\r\nantiquated furniture of dark velvet tapestry corresponded well with the\r\nanxious looks of its occupants.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the room stood the Baron von Bartenstein and the Count\r\nvon Uhlefeld, the two powerful statesmen who for thirteen years had been\r\nhonored by the confidence of the empress. Together they stood, their\r\nconsequence acknowledged by all, while with proud and lofty mien, they\r\nwhispered of state secrets.\r\n\r\nUpon the fair, smooth face of Bartenstein appeared an expression of\r\nhaughty triumph, which he was at no pains to conceal; and over the\r\ndelicate mouth of Von Uhlefeld fluttered a smile of ineffable\r\ncomplacency.\r\n\r\n\"I feel perfectly secure,\" whispered Von Bartenstein. \"The empress will\r\ncertainly renew the treaties, and continue the policy which we have\r\nhitherto pursued with such brilliant results to Austria.\"\r\n\r\n\"The empress is wise,\" returned Uhlefeld. \"She can reckon upon our\r\nstanch support, and so long as she pursues this policy, we will sustain\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nWhile he spoke, there shot from his eyes such a glance of conscious\r\npower, that the two lords who, from the recess of a neighboring window,\r\nwere watching the imperial favorites, were completely dazzled.\r\n\r\n\"See, count\" murmured one to the other, \"see how Count Uhlefeld smiles\r\nto-day. Doubtless he knows already what the decision of the empress is\r\nto be; and that it is in accordance with his wishes, no one can doubt\r\nwho looks upon him now.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be well for us,\" replied Count Colloredo, \"if we subscribe\r\nunconditionally to the opinions of the lord chancellor. I, for my part,\r\nwill do so all the more readily, that I confess to you my utter\r\nignorance of the question which is to come before us to-day. I was\r\nreally so preoccupied at our last sitting that I--I failed exactly to\r\ncomprehend its nature. I think, therefore, that it will be well for us\r\nto vote with Count von Uhlefeld--that is, if the president of the Aulic\r\nCouncil, Count Harrach, does not entertain other opinions.\"\r\n\r\nCount Harrach bowed. \"As for me,\" sighed he, \"I must, as usual, vote\r\nwith Count Bartenstein. His will be, as it ever is, the decisive voice\r\nof the day; and its echo will be heard from the lips of the empress. Let\r\nus echo them both, and so be the means of helping to crush the\r\npresumption of yonder crafty and arrogant courtier.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he glanced toward the massive table of carved oak, around\r\nwhich were arranged the leathern arm-chairs of the members of the Aulic\r\nCouncil. Count Colloredo followed the glance of his friend, which, with\r\na supercilious expression, rested upon the person to whom he alluded.\r\nThis person was seated in one of the chairs, deeply absorbed in the\r\nperusal of the papers that lay before him upon the table. He was a man\r\nof slight and elegant proportions, whose youthful face contrasted\r\nsingularly with the dark, manly, and weather-beaten countenances of the\r\nother members of the council. Not a fault marred the beauty of this fair\r\nface; not the shadow of a wrinkle ruffled the polish of the brow; even\r\nthe lovely mouth itself was free from those lines by which thought and\r\ncare are wont to mark the passage of man through life. One thing,\r\nhowever, was wanting to this beautiful mask. It was devoid of\r\nexpression. Those delicate features were immobile and stony, No trace of\r\nemotion stirred the compressed lips; no shadow of thought flickered over\r\nthe high, marble brow; and the glance of those clear, light-blue eyes\r\nwas as calm, cold, and unfeeling as that of a statue. This young man,\r\nwith Medusa-like beauty, was Anthony Wenzel von Kaunitz, whom Maria\r\nTheresa had lately recalled from Paris to take his seat in her cabinet\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\nThe looks of Harrach and Colloredo were directed toward him, but he\r\nappeared not to observe them, and went on quietly with his examination\r\nof the state papers.\r\n\r\n\"You think, then, count,\" whispered Colloredo, thoughtfully, \"that young\r\nKaunitz cherishes the absurd hope of an alliance with France?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure of it. I know that a few days ago the French ambassador\r\ndelivered to him a most affectionate missive from his friend the\r\nMarquise de Pompadour; and I know too that yesterday he replied to it in\r\na similar strain: It is his fixed idea, and that of La Pompadour also,\r\nto drive Austria into a new line of policy, by making her the ally of\r\nFrance.\"\r\n\r\nCount Colloredo laughed. \"The best cure that I know of for fixed ideas\r\nis the madhouse,\" replied he, \"and thither we will send little Kaunitz\r\nif--\"\r\n\r\nHe ceased suddenly, for Kaunitz had slowly raised his eyes from the\r\ntable, and they now rested with such an icy gaze upon the smiling face\r\nof Colloredo, that the frightened statesman shivered.\r\n\r\n\"If he should have heard me!\" murmured he. \"If he--\" but the poor count\r\nhad no further time for reflection; for at that moment the folding-doors\r\nleading to the private apartments of the empress were thrown open, and\r\nthe lord high steward announced the approach of her majesty.\r\n\r\nThe councillors advanced to the table, and in respectful silence awaited\r\nthe imperial entrance.\r\n\r\nThe rustling of silk was heard; and then the quick step of the Countess\r\nFuchs, whose duty it was to accompany the empress to the threshold of\r\nher council-chamber, and to close the door behind her.\r\n\r\nAnd now appeared the majestic figure of the empress. The lords laid\r\ntheir hands upon their swords, and inclined their heads in reverence\r\nbefore the imperial lady, who with light, elastic step advanced to the\r\ntable, while the Countess Fuchs noiselessly closed the door and\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nThe empress smilingly acknowledged the salutation, though her smile was\r\nlost to her respectful subjects, who, in obedience to the strict Spanish\r\netiquette which prevailed at the Austrian court, remained with their\r\nheads bent until the sovereign had taken her seat upon the throne.\r\n\r\nOne of these subjects had bent his head with the rest, but he had\r\nventured to raise it again, and he at least met the glance of royalty.\r\nThis bold subject was Kaunitz, the youngest of the councillors.\r\n\r\nHe gazed at the advancing empress, and for the first time a smile\r\nflitted over his stony features. And well might the sight of his\r\nsovereign lady stir the marble heart of Kaunitz; for Maria Theresa was\r\none of the loveliest women of her day. Though thirty-six years of age,\r\nand the mother of thirteen children, she was still beautiful, and the\r\nAustrians were proud to excess of her beauty. Her high, thoughtful\r\nforehead was shaded by a profusion of blond hair, which lightly powdered\r\nand gathered up behind in one rich mass, was there confined by a golden\r\nnet. Her large, starry eyes were of that peculiar gray which changes\r\nwith every emotion of the soul; at one time seeming to be heavenly-blue,\r\nat another the darkest and most flashing brown. Her bold profile\r\nbetokened great pride; but every look of haughtiness was softened away\r\nby the enchanting expression of a mouth in whose exquisite beauty no\r\ntrace of the so-called \"Austrian lip\" could be seen. Her figure, loftier\r\nthan is usual with women, was of faultless symmetry, while her graceful\r\nbust would have seemed to the eyes of Praxiteles the waking to life of\r\nhis own dreams of Juno.\r\n\r\nThose who looked upon this beautiful empress could well realize the\r\nemotions which thirteen years before had stirred the hearts of the\r\nHungarian nobles as she stood before them; and had wrought them up to\r\nthat height of enthusiasm which culminated in the well-known shout of\r\n\r\n\"MORIAMUR PRO REGE NOSTRO!\"\r\n\r\n\"Our king!\" cried the Hungarians, and they were right. For Maria\r\nTheresa, who with her husband, was the tender wife; toward her children,\r\nthe loving mother; was in all that related to her empire, her people,\r\nand her sovereignty, a man both in the scope of her comprehension and\r\nthe strength of her will. She was capable of sketching bold lines of\r\npolicy, and of following them out without reference to personal\r\npredilections or prejudices, both of which she was fully competent to\r\nstifle, wherever they threatened interference with the good of her\r\nrealm, or her sense of duty as a sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe energy and determination of her character were written upon the\r\nlofty brow of Maria Theresa; and now, as she approached her councillors,\r\nthese characteristics beamed forth from her countenance with such power\r\nand such beauty, that Kaunitz himself was overawed, and for one moment a\r\nsmile lit up his cold features.\r\n\r\nNo one saw this smile except the imperial lady, who had woke the Memnon\r\ninto life; and as she took her seat upon the throne, she slightly bent\r\nher head in return.\r\n\r\nNow, with her clear and sonorous voice, she invited her councillors also\r\nto be seated, and at once reached out her hand for the memoranda which\r\nCount Bartenstein had prepared for her examination.\r\n\r\nShe glanced quickly over the papers, and laid them aside. \"My lords of\r\nthe Aulic Council,\" said she, in tones of deep earnestness, \"we have\r\nto-day a question of gravest import to discuss. I crave thereunto your\r\nattention and advice. We are at this sitting to deliberate upon the\r\nfuture policy of Austria, and deeply significant will be the result of\r\nthis day's deliberations to Austria's welfare. Some of our old treaties\r\nare about to expire. Time, which has somewhat moderated the bitterness\r\nof our enemies, seems also to have weakened the amity of our friends.\r\nBoth are dying away; and the question now before us is, whether we shall\r\nextinguish enmity, or rekindle friendship? For seventy years past\r\nEngland, Holland, and Sardinia have been our allies. For three hundred\r\nyears France has been our hereditary enemy. Shall we renew our alliance\r\nwith the former powers, or seek new relations with the latter? Let me\r\nhave your views, my lords.\"\r\n\r\nWith these concluding words, Maria Theresa waved her hand, and pointed\r\nto Count Uhlefeld. The lord chancellor arose, and with a dignified\r\ninclination of the head, responded to the appeal.\r\n\r\n\"Since your majesty permits me to speak, I vote without hesitation for\r\nthe renewal of our treaty with the maritime powers. For seventy years\r\nour relations with these powers have been amicable and honorable. In our\r\ndays of greatest extremity--when Louis XIV. took Alsatia and the city of\r\nStrasburg, and his ally, the Turkish Sultan, besieged Vienna--when two\r\npowerful enemies threatened Austria with destruction, it was this\r\nalliance with the maritime powers and with Sardinia, which, next to the\r\nsuccor of the generous King of Poland, saved our capital, and Savoy held\r\nLombardy in check, while England and Holland guarded the Netherlands,\r\nwhich, since the days of Philip II., have ever been the nest of\r\nrebellion and revolt. To this alliance, therefore, we owe it that your\r\nmajesty still reigns over those seditious provinces. To Savoy we are\r\nindebted for Lombardy; while France, perfidious France, has not only\r\nrobbed us of our territory, but to this day asserts her right to its\r\npossession! No, your majesty--so long as France retains that which\r\nbelongs to Austria, Austria will neither forgive her enmity nor forget\r\nit. See, on the contrary, how the maritime powers have befriended us! It\r\nwas THEIR gold which enabled us first to withstand France, and afterward\r\nPrussia--THEIR gold that filled your majesty's coffers--THEIR gold that\r\nsustained and confirmed the prosperity of your majesty's dominions. This\r\nis the alliance that I advocate, and with all my heart I vote for its\r\nrenewal. It is but just that the princes and rulers of the earth should\r\ngive example to the world of good faith in their dealings; for the\r\nintegrity of the sovereign is a pledge to all nations of the integrity\r\nof his people.\"\r\n\r\nCount Uhlefeld resumed his seat, and after him rose the powerful\r\nfavorite of the empress, Count Bartenstein, who, in a long and animated\r\naddress, came vehemently to the support of Uhlefeld.\r\n\r\nThen came Counts Colloredo and Harrach, and the lord high steward, Count\r\nKhevenhuller--all unanimous for a renewal of the old treaty. Not one of\r\nthese rich, proud nobles would have dared to breathe a sentiment in\r\nopposition to the two powerful statesmen that had spoken before them.\r\nBartenstein and Uhlefeld had passed the word. The alliance must continue\r\nwith those maritime powers, from whose subsidies such unexampled wealth\r\nhad flowed into the coffers of Austria, and--those of the lords of the\r\nexchequer! For, up to the times of which we write, it was a fundamental\r\ndoctrine of court faith, that the task of inquiry into the accounts of\r\nthe imperial treasury was one far beneath the dignity of the sovereign.\r\nThe lords of the exchequer, therefore, were responsible to nobody for\r\ntheir administration of the funds arising from the Dutch and English\r\nsubsidies.\r\n\r\nIt was natural, then, that the majority of the Aulic Council should vote\r\nfor the old alliance. While they argued and voted, Kaunitz, the least\r\nimportant personage of them all, sat perfectly unconcerned, paying not\r\nthe slightest attention to the wise deductions of his colleagues. He\r\nseemed much occupied in straightening loose papers, mending his pen, and\r\nremoving with his finger-tips the tiny, specks that flecked the lustre\r\nof his velvet coat. Once, while Bartenstein was delivering his long\r\naddress, Kaunitz carried his indifference so far as to draw out his\r\nrepeater (on which was painted a portrait of La Pompadour, set in\r\ndiamonds) and strike the hour! The musical ring of the little bell\r\nsounded a fairy accompaniment to the deep and earnest tones of\r\nBartenstein's voice; while Kaunitz, seeming to hear nothing else, held\r\nthe watch up to his ear and counted its strokes. [Footnote: Vide\r\nKormayr, \"Austrian Plutarch,\" vol. xii., p.352.] The empress, who was\r\naccustomed to visit the least manifestation of such inattention on the\r\npart of her councillors with open censure--the empress, so observant of\r\nform, and so exacting of its observance in others--seemed singularly\r\nindulgent to-day; for while Kaunitz was listening to the music of his\r\nwatch, his imperial mistress looked on with half a smile. At last, when\r\nthe fifth orator had spoken, and it became the turn of Kaunitz to vote,\r\nMaria Theresa turned her flashing eyes upon him with a glance of anxious\r\nand appealing expectation.\r\n\r\nAs her look met his, how had all coldness and unconcern vanished from\r\nhis face! How glowed his eyes with the lustre of great and world-swaying\r\nthoughts, as, rising from his chair, he returned the gaze of his\r\nsovereign with one that seemed to crave forbearance!\r\n\r\nBut Kaunitz had almost preternatural control over his emotions, and he\r\nrecovered himself at once.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot vote for a renewal of our worn-out alliance with the maritime\r\npowers,\" said he, in a clear and determined voice. As he uttered these\r\nwords, looks of astonishment and disapprobation were, visible upon the\r\nfaces of his colleagues. The lord chancellor contented himself with a\r\ncontemptuous shrug and a supercilious smile. Kaunitz perceived it, and\r\nmet both shrug and smile with undisturbed composure, while calmly and\r\nslowly he repeated his offending words. For a moment he paused, as if to\r\ngive time to his hearers to test the flavor of his new and startling\r\nlanguage. Then, firm and collected, he went on:\r\n\r\n\"Our alliance with England and Holland has long been a yoke and a\r\nhumiliation to Austria. If, in its earlier days, this alliance ever\r\nafforded us protection, dearly have we paid for that protection, and we\r\nhave been forced to buy it with fearful sacrifices to our national\r\npride. Never for one moment have these two powers allowed us to forget\r\nthat we have been dependent upon their bounty for money and defence.\r\nJealous of the growing power and influence of Austria, before whose\r\nyouthful and vigorous career lies the glory of future greatness--jealous\r\nof our increasing wealth--jealous of the splendor of Maria Theresa's\r\nreign--these powers, whose faded laurels are buried in the grave of the\r\npast, have compassed sea and land to stop the flow of our prosperity,\r\nand sting the pride of our nationality. With their tyrannical commercial\r\nedicts, they have dealt injury to friends as well as foes. The closing\r\nof the Scheldt and Rhine, the Barrier treaty, and all the other\r\nrestrictions upon trade devised by those crafty English to damage the\r\ntraffic of other nations, all these compacts have been made as binding\r\nupon Austria as upon every other European power. Unmindful of their\r\nalliance with us, the maritime powers have closed their ports against\r\nour ships; and while affecting to watch the Netherlands in our behalf,\r\nthey have been nothing better than spies, seeking to discover whether\r\nour flag transcended in the least the limits of our own blockaded\r\nfrontiers; and whether to any but to themselves accrued the profits of\r\ntrade with the Baltic and North Seas. Vraiment, such friendship lies\r\nheavily upon us, and its weight feels almost like that of enmity. At\r\nAix-la-Chapelle I had to remind the English ambassador that his\r\nunknightly and arrogant bearing toward Austria was unseemly both to the\r\nsex and majesty of Austria's empress. And our august sovereign herself,\r\nnot long since, saw fit to reprove the insolence of this same British\r\nenvoy, who in her very presence spoke of the Netherlands as though they\r\nhad been a boon to Austria from England's clemency. Incensed at the tone\r\nof this representative of our friends, the empress exclaimed: 'Am I not\r\nruler in the Netherlands as well as in Vienna? Do I hold my right of\r\nempire from England and Holland?'\" [Footnote: Coxe, \"History of the\r\nHouse of Austria,\" vol. v., p. 51.]\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" interrupted Maria Theresa, impetuously, \"yes, it is true. The\r\narrogance of these royal traders has provoked me beyond all bearing. I\r\nwill no longer permit them to insinuate of my own imperial rights that I\r\nhold them as favors from the hand of any earthly power. It chafes the\r\npride of an empress-queen to be CALLED a friend and TREATED as a vassal;\r\nand I intend that these proud allies shall feel that I resent their\r\naffronts!\"\r\n\r\nIt was wonderful to see the effect of these impassioned words upon the\r\nauditors of the empress. They quaked as they thought how they had voted,\r\nand their awe-stricken faces were pallid with fright. Uhlefeld and\r\nBartenstein exchanged glances of amazement and dismay; while the other\r\nnobles, like adroit courtiers, fixed their looks, with awakening\r\nadmiration, upon Kaunitz, in whom their experienced eyes were just\r\ndiscovering the rising luminary of a new political firmament.\r\n\r\nHe, meanwhile, had inclined his head and smiled when the empress had\r\ninterrupted him. She ceased, and after a short pause, Kaunitz resumed,\r\nwith unaltered equanimity: \"Your majesty has been graciously pleased to\r\ntestify, in your own sovereign person, to the tyranny of our two\r\nnorthern allies. It remains, therefore, to speak of Sardinia\r\nalone--Sardinia, who HELD LOMBARDY IN CHECK. No sooner had Victor\r\nAmadeus put his royal signature to the treaty made by him with Austria,\r\nthan he turned to his confidants and said (loud enough for us to hear\r\nhim in Vienna): 'Lombardy is mine. I will take it, but I shall eat it\r\nup, leaf by leaf, like an artichoke.' And methinks his majesty of\r\nSardinia has proved himself to be a good trencherman. He has already\r\nswallowed several leaves of his artichoke, in that he is master of\r\nseveral of the fairest provinces of Lombardy. It is true that this royal\r\ngourmand has laid aside his crown; and that in his place reigns Victor\r\nEmanuel, of whom Lord Chesterfield, in a burst of enthusiasm, has said,\r\nthat `he never did and never will commit an act of injustice.' Concede\r\nthat Victor Emanuel is the soul of honor; still,\" added Kaunitz with a\r\nshake of the head, and an incredulous smile \"still--the Italian princes\r\nare abominable geographers--and they are inordinately fond of\r\nartichokes. [Footnote: Kaunitz's own words. Kotmayr, \"Austrian\r\nPlutarch,\" vol. xi.] Now their fondness for this vegetable is as\r\ndangerous to Austria as the too loving grasp of her northern allies, who\r\nwith their friendly hands not only close their ports against us, but lay\r\nthe weight of their favors so heavily upon our heads as to force us\r\ndown upon our knees before them. What have we from England and Holland\r\nbut their subsidies? And Austria can now afford to relinquish them--\r\nAustria is rich, powerful, prosperous enough to be allowed to proffer\r\nher friendship where it will be honorably returned. Austria, then, must\r\nbe freed from her oppressive alliance with the maritime powers. She has\r\nyouth and vitality enough to shake off this bondage, and strike for the\r\nnew path which shall lead her to greatness and glory. There is a moral\r\nand intangible greatness, of whose existence these trading Englishmen\r\nhave no conception, but which the refined and elevated people of France\r\nare fully competent to appreciate. France extends to us her hand, and\r\noffers us alliance on terms of equality. Cooperating with France, we\r\nshall defy the enmity of all Europe. With our two-edged sword we shall\r\nturn the scales of future European strife, and make peace or war for\r\nother nations. France, too, is our natural ally, for she is our\r\nneighbor. And she is more than this, for she is our ally by the sacred\r\nunity of one faith. The Holy Father at Rome, who blesses the arms of\r\nAustria, will no longer look sorrowfully upon Austria's league with\r\nheresy. When apostolic France and we are one, the blessings of the\r\nChurch will descend upon our alliance. Religion, therefore, as well as\r\nhonest statesmanship, call for the treaty with France.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" cried Maria Theresa, rising quickly from her seat, her eyes\r\nglowing with enthusiastic fire, \"I vote joyfully with Count Kaunitz. I,\r\ntoo, vote for alliance with France. The count has spoken as it stirs my\r\nheart to hear an Austrian speak. He loves his fatherland, and in his\r\ndevotion he casts far from him all thought of worldly profit or\r\nadvancement. I tender him my warmest thanks, and I will take his words\r\nto heart.\"\r\n\r\nOvercome with the excitement of the moment, the empress reached her hand\r\nto Kaunitz, who eagerly seized and pressed it to his lips.\r\n\r\nCount Uhlefeld watched this extraordinary scene with astonishment and\r\nconsternation. Bartenstein, so long the favorite minister of Maria\r\nTheresa, was deadly pale, and his lips were compressed as though he were\r\ntrying to suppress a burst of rage. Harrach, Colloredo, and Khevenhuller\r\nhung their heads, while they turned over in their little minds how best\r\nto curry favor with the new minister.\r\n\r\nThe empress saw nothing of the dismayed faces around her. Her soul was\r\nfilled with high emotions, and her countenance beamed gloriously with\r\nthe fervor of her boundless patriotism.\r\n\r\n\"Everything for Austria! My heart, my soul, my life, all are for my\r\nfatherland,\" said Maria Theresa, with her beautiful eyes raised to\r\nheaven. \"And now, my lords,\" added she, after a pause, \"I must retire,\r\nto beg light and counsel from the Almighty. I have learned your\r\ndifferent views on the great question of this day; and when Heaven shall\r\nhave taught me what to do, I will decide.\"\r\n\r\nShe waved her hand in parting salutation, and with her loftiest imperial\r\nbearing left the room.\r\n\r\nUntil the doors were closed, the lords of the council remained standing\r\nwith inclined heads. Then they looked from one to another with faces of\r\nwonder and inquiry. Kaunitz alone seemed unembarrassed; and gathering up\r\nhis papers with as much unconcern as if nothing had happened, he\r\nslightly bent his head and left the room.\r\n\r\nNever before had any member of the Aulic Council dared to leave that\r\nroom until the lord chancellor had given the signal of departure. It was\r\na case of unparalleled violation of court etiquette. Count Uhlefeld was\r\naghast, and Bartenstein seemed crushed. Without exchanging a word, the\r\ntwo friends rose, and with eyes cast down, and faces pale with the\r\nanguish of that hour, together they left the council-chamber toward\r\nwhich they had repaired with hearts and bearing so triumphant.\r\n\r\nColloredo and Harrach followed silently to the anteroom, and bowed\r\ndeferentially as their late masters passed through. But no sooner had\r\nthe door closed, than the two courtiers exchanged malicious smiles.\r\n\r\n\"Fallen favorites,\" laughed Harrach. \"Quenched lights which yesterday\r\nshone like suns, and to-day are burnt to ashes! There is to be a soiree\r\nto-night at Bartenstein's. For the first time in eleven years I shall\r\nstay away from Bartenstein's soirees.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" replied Colloredo, laughing, \"had invited Ulhlefeld for\r\nto-morrow. But, as the entertainment was all in his honor, I shall be\r\ntaken with a sudden indisposition, and countermand my supper.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will be a most summary proceeding,\" said Harrach. \"I see that you\r\nbelieve the sun of Uhlefeld and Bartenstein has set forever.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am convinced of it. They have their death-blow.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the rising sun? You think it will be called Kaunitz?\"\r\n\r\n\"Will be? It is called Kaunitz: so take my advice. Kaunitz I know, is\r\nnot a man to be bribed; but he has two weaknesses--women and horses.\r\nYou are, for the present, the favorite of La Fortina; and yesterday you\r\nwon from Count Esterhazy an Arabian, which Kaunitz says is the finest\r\nhorse in Vienna. If I were you, I would present to him both my mistress\r\nand my horse. Who knows but what these courtesies may induce him to\r\nadopt you as a PROTEGE?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE LETTER.\r\n\r\nFrom her cabinet council the empress passed at once to her private\r\napartments. When business was over for the, day, she loved to cast the\r\ncares of sovereignty behind, and become a woman--chatting with her\r\nladies of honor over the \"on dits\" of the court and city. During the\r\nhours devoted to her toilet, Maria Theresa gave herself up unreservedly\r\nto enjoyment. But she was so impetuous, that her ladies of honor were\r\nnever quite secure that some little annoyance would not ruffle the\r\nserenity of her temper. The young girl whose duty it was to read aloud\r\nto the empress and dress her hair, used to declare that she would sooner\r\nwade through three hours' worth of Latin dispatches from Hungary, than\r\nspend one half hour as imperial hair-dresser.\r\n\r\nBut today, as she entered her dressing-room, the eyes of the empress\r\nbeamed with pleasure, and her mouth was wreathed with sunny smiles. The\r\nlittle hair-dresser was delighted, and with a responsive smile took her\r\nplace, and prepared for her important duties. Maria Theresa glided into\r\nthe chair, and with her own hands began to unfasten the golden net that\r\nconfined her hair. She then leaned forward, and, with a pleased\r\nexpression, contemplated the beautiful face that looked out from the\r\nsilver-framed Venetian glass before which she sat.\r\n\r\n\"Make me very charming today, Charlotte,\" said she. [Footnote: Charlotte\r\nvon Hieronymus was the mother of Caroline Pichler.]\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty needs no help from me to look charming,\" said the gentle\r\nvoice of the little tire-woman. \"No hair-dresser had lent you her aid on\r\nthat day when your Magyar nobles swore to die for you, and yet the world\r\nsays that never were eyes of loyal subjects dazzled by such beauty and\r\nsuch grace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes, child, but that was thirteen years ago. Thirteen years! How\r\nmany cares have lain upon my heart since that day! If my face is\r\nwrinkled and my hair grown gray, I may thank that hateful King of\r\nPrussia, for he is the cause of it all.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he has no greater sins to repent of than those two,\" replied\r\nCharlotte, with an admiring smile, \"he may sleep soundly. Your majesty's\r\nforehead is unruffled by a wrinkle, and your hair is as glossy and as\r\nbrown as ever it was.\"\r\n\r\nBrighter still was the smile of the empress, as she turned quickly round\r\nand exclaimed: \"Then you think I have still beauty enough to please the\r\nemperor? If you do, make good use of it today, for I have something of\r\nimportance to ask of him, and I long to find favor in his eyes. To work,\r\nthen, Charlotte, and be quick, for--\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment, the silken hangings before the door of the dressing-room\r\nwere drawn hastily aside, and the Countess Fuchs stepped forward.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, countess,\" continued the empress, \"you are just in time for a\r\ncabinet toilet council.\"\r\n\r\nBut the lady of honor showed no disposition to respond to the gay\r\ngreeting of her sovereign. With stiffest Spanish ceremony, she\r\ncourtesied deeply. \"Pardon me, your majesty, if I interrupt you,\" said\r\nshe, solemnly, \"but I have something to communicate to yourself alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, countess!\" exclaimed Maria Theresa, anxiously, \"you look as if you\r\nbare me sad tidings. But speak out-Charlotte knows as many state secrets\r\nas you do; you need not be reserved before her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me,\" again replied the ceremonious lady, with another deep\r\ncourtesy, \"I bring no news of state--I must speak with your majesty\r\nalone.\"'\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the empress dilated with fear. \"No state secret,\" murmured\r\nshe; \"oh, what can it be, then? Go, Charlotte, go, child, and remain\r\nuntil I recall you.\"\r\n\r\nThe door closed behind the tired woman, and the empress cried out: \"Now\r\nwe are alone, be quick, and speak out what you have to say. You have\r\ncome to give me pain, I feel it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty ordered me, some time since,\" began the countess in her\r\nlow, unsympathizing tones, \"to watch the imperial household, so that\r\nnothing might transpire within it that came not to the knowledge of your\r\nmajesty. I have lately watched the movements of the emperor's valet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" cried the empress, clasping her hands convulsively together, \"you\r\nwatched him, and\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty, I watched him, and I was informed this morning that\r\nhe had left the emperor's apartments with a sealed note in his hands,\r\nand had gone into the city.\"\r\n\r\n\"No more just yet,\" said the empress, with trembling lip.\r\n\r\n\"Give me air! I cannot breathe.\" With wild emotion she tore open her\r\nvelvet bodice, and heaving a deep sigh, signed to the countess to go on.\r\n\r\n\"My spy awaited Gaspardi's return, and stopped him. He was forbidden, in\r\nthe name of your majesty, to go farther. \"\r\n\r\n\"Go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was brought to me, your majesty, and now awaits your orders.\"\r\n\r\n\"So that if there is an answer to the note, he has it,\" said Maria\r\nTheresa, sharply. The countess bowed.\r\n\r\n\"Where is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the antechamber, your majesty.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress bounded from her seat, and walked across the room. Her face\r\nwas flushed with anger, and she trembled in every limb. She seemed\r\nundecided what to do; but at last she stopped suddenly, and blushing\r\ndeeply, without looking at the countess, she said in a low voice, \"Bring\r\nhim hither.\"\r\n\r\nThe countess disappeared and returned, followed by Gaspardi. Maria\r\nTheresa strode impetuously forward, and bent her threatening eyes upon\r\nthe valet. But the shrewd Italian knew better than to meet the lightning\r\nglance of an angry empress. With downcast looks and reverential\r\nobeisance he awaited her commands. \"Look at me, Gaspardi,\" said she, in\r\ntones that sounded in the valet's ears like distant thunder. \"Answer my\r\nquestions, sir\"\r\n\r\nGaspardi raised his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"To whom was the note addressed that was given you by the emperor this\r\nmorning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty, I did not presume to look at it,\" replied Gaspardi,\r\nquietly. \"His imperial majesty was pleased to tell me where to take it,\r\nand that sufficed me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And whither did you take it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Imperial majesty, I have forgotten the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"What street, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, imperial majesty; these dreadful German names are too hard\r\nfor my Italian tongue. As soon as I had obeyed his majesty's commands, I\r\nforgot the name of the street.\"\r\n\r\n\"So that you are resolved not to tell me where you went with the\r\nemperor's note?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, imperial majesty, I have totally forgotten.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress looked as if she longed to annihilate a menial who defied\r\nher so successfully.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" exclaimed she, \"that you are crafty and deceitful, but you\r\nshall not escape me. I command you, as your sovereign, to give up the\r\nnote you bear about you for the emperor. I myself will deliver it to his\r\nmajesty.\"\r\n\r\nGaspardi gave a start, and unconsciously his hand sought the place where\r\nthe note was concealed. He turned very pale and stammered, \"Imperial\r\nmajesty, I have no letter for the emperor.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have it there!\" thundered the infuriated empress, as with\r\nthreatening hand she pointed to the valet's breast. \"Deliver it at once,\r\nor I will call my lackeys to search you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty forces me then to betray my lord and emperor?\" asked\r\nGaspardi, trembling.\r\n\r\n\"You serve him more faithfully by relinquishing the letter than by\r\nretaining it,\" returned Maria Theresa, hastily. \"Once more I command you\r\nto give it up.\"\r\n\r\nGaspardi heaved a sigh of anguish, and looked imploringly at the\r\nempress. But in the trembling lips, the flashing eyes, the flushed\r\ncheeks that met his entreating glance, he saw no symptoms of relenting,\r\nand he dared the strife no longer. His hand shook as he drew forth the\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nThe empress uttered a cry, and with the fury of a lioness snatched the\r\npaper and crushed it in her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty,\" whispered the countess, \"dismiss the valet before\r\nhe learns too much. He might--\"\r\n\r\n\"Woe to him if he breathes a word to one human being!\" cried the\r\nempress, with menacing gesture. \"Woe to him if he dare breathe one word\r\nto his master!\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven forbid that I should betray the secrets of my sovereign!\" cried\r\nthe affrighted Gaspardi. \"But, imperial majesty, what am I to say to my\r\nlord the emperor?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will tell your lord that you brought no answer, and it will not be\r\nthe first lie with which you have befooled his imperial ears,\" replied\r\nMaria Theresa coutemptuously, while she waved her hand as a signal of\r\ndismissal. The unhappy Mercury retired, and as he disappeared, the\r\npent-up anguish of the empress burst forth.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Margaretta,\" cried she, in accents of wildest grief, \"what an\r\nunfortunate woman I am! In all my life I have loved but one man! My\r\nheart, my soul, my every thought are his, and he robs me, the mother of\r\nhis children, of his love, and bestows it upon another!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the inconstancy is but momentary,\" replied the countess, who\r\nburned to know the contents of the letter. \"Perhaps there is no\r\ninconstancy at all. This may be nothing but an effort on the part of\r\nsome frivolous coquette to draw our handsome emperor within the net of\r\nher guilty attractions. The note would show--\" The empress scarcely\r\nheeded the words of her confidante. She had opened her hand, and was\r\ngazing upon the crumpled paper that held her husband's secret.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" murmured she, plaintively. \"Oh, it seems to me that a thousand\r\ndaggers have sprung from this little paper, to make my heart's blood\r\nflow. Who is the foolhardy woman that would entice my husband from his\r\nloyalty to me? Woe, woe to her when I shall have learned her name! And I\r\nwill learn it!\" cried the unhappy wife. \"I myself will take this letter\r\nto the emperor, and he shall open it in my presence. I will have\r\njustice! Adultery is a fearful crime, and fearful shall be its\r\npunishment in my realms. The name! the name! Oh, that I knew the name of\r\nthe execrable woman who has dared to lift her treasonable eyes toward my\r\nhusband!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is easier than to learn it, your majesty,\" whispered the\r\ncountess, \"squat like a toad, close to the ear of Eve\"--\"the letter will\r\nreveal it.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress frowned. Oh, for Ithuriel then!\r\n\r\n\"Dost mean that I shall open a letter which was never intended to be\r\nread by me?\"\r\n\r\nThe countess pointed to the paper. \"Your majesty has already broken the\r\nseal. You crushed it unintentionally. There remains but to unfold the\r\npaper, and every thing is explained. I will wage that it comes from the\r\nbeautiful dancer Riccardo, whom the emperor admired so much last night\r\nin the ballet, and whom he declared to be the most bewitching creature\r\nhe had ever seen.\"\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the empress dropped burning tears, and, covering her face\r\nwith her hands, she sobbed aloud. Then she seemed ashamed of her\r\nemotion, and raised her beautiful head again.\r\n\r\n\"It is contemptible so to mourn for one who is faithless,\" said she. \"It\r\nis for me to judge and to punish, and that will I! It is my duty as\r\nruler of Austria to bring crime to light. I will soon learn who it is\r\nthat dares to exchange letters with the husband of the reigning empress.\r\nAnd after all, the speediest, the simplest way to do this, lies before\r\nme. I must open the letter, for justice sake; but I swear that I will\r\nnot read one word contained within its stages. I will see the name of\r\nthe writer alone; and then I can be sure that curiosity and personal\r\ninterest have not prompted me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so Maria Theresa silenced her scruples, and persuaded herself that\r\nshe was compelled to do as the tempter had suggested. She tore open the\r\nnote; but true to her self-imposed vow, she paused on the threshold of\r\ndishonor, and read nothing but the writer's name.\r\n\r\n\"Riccardo!\" cried she, wildly. \"You were right, Margaretta: an intrigue\r\nwith the Riccardo. The emperor has written to her--the emperor, my\r\nhusband!\"\r\n\r\nShe folded the fatal letter, and oh, how her white hands trembled as she\r\nlaid it upon the table I and how deadly pale were the cheeks that had\r\nflushed with anger when Gaspardi had been by!\r\n\r\nThe countess was not deceived by this phase of the empress's grief. She\r\nknew that the storm would burst, and she thought it better to divide its\r\nwrath. She stepped lightly out to call the confessor of her victim.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa was unconscious of being alone. She stood before the table\r\nstaring at the letter. Gradually her paleness vanished, and the hue of\r\nanger once more deepened on her cheeks. Her eyes, which had just been\r\ndrooping with tears, flamed again with indignation; and her expanded\r\nnostrils, her twitching mouth, and her heaving chest, betrayed the fury\r\nof the storm that was raging within.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I will trample her under foot!\" muttered she between her teeth,\r\nwhile she raised her hand as if she would fain have dealt a\r\nleach-stroke. \"I will prove to the court--to the empire--to the world,\r\nhow Maria Theresa hates vice, and how she punishes crime, without\r\nrespect of persons. Both criminals shall feel the lash of justice. If my\r\nwoman's heart break, the empress shall do her duty. It shall not be said\r\nthat lust holds its revels in Vienna, as at the obscene courts of\r\nVersailles and St. Petersburg. No! Nor shall the libertines of Vienna\r\npoint to the Austrian emperor as their model, nor shall their weeping\r\nwives be taunted with reports of the indulgence of the Austrian empress.\r\nMorality and decorum shall prevail in Vienna. The fire of my royal\r\nvengeance shall consume that bold harlot, and then--then for the\r\nemperor!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty will never consent to bring disgrace upon the father of\r\nyour imperial children,\" said a gentle voice close by, and, turning at\r\nthe sound, the empress beheld her confessor.\r\n\r\nShe advanced hastily toward Father Porhammer. \"How!\" exclaimed she\r\nangrily, \"how!--you venture to plead for the emperor? You come hither to\r\nstay the hand of justice?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do indeed,\" replied the father, \"for to-day at least, her hand, if\r\nuplifted against the emperor, must recoil upon the empress. The honor of\r\nmy august sovereigns cannot be divided. Your majesty must throw the\r\nshield of your love over the fault of your imperial husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I cannot! I cannot suffer this mortal blow in silence,\" sobbed the\r\nempress.\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" said the father, smiling, \"the wife may be severe, though the\r\nempress be clement.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she, father--must she also be pardoned? she who has enticed my\r\nhusband from his conjugal faith?\"\r\n\r\n\"As for the Riccardo,\" replied Father Porhammer, \"I have heard that she\r\nis a sinful woman, whose beauty has led many men astray. If your majesty\r\ndeem her dangerous, she can be made to leave Vienna; but let retribution\r\ngo no further.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, be it so,\" sighed the empress, whose heart was already softening.\r\n\"You are right, reverend father, but La Riccardo shall leave Vienna\r\nforever.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, she hastened to her escritoire, and wrote and signed the\r\norder for the banishment of the danseuse.\r\n\r\n\"There.\" cried she, handing the order to the priest. \"I pray you, dear\r\nfather, remit this to Count Bartenstein, and let him see that she goes\r\nhence this very day. And when I shall have laid this evil spirit,\r\nperchance I may find peace once more. But, no, no!\" continued she, her\r\neyes filling with tears; \"when she has gone, some other enchantress will\r\ncome in her place to charm my husband's love away. Oh, father, if\r\nchastity is not in the heart, sin will always find entrance there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty; and therefore should the portals of the heart be\r\never guarded against the enemy. As watchmen are appointed to guard the\r\nproperty, so are the servants of God sent on earth to extend the\r\nprotection of Heaven to the hearts of your people.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why may I not aid them in their holy labors?\" exclaimed the\r\nempress, glowing suddenly with a new interest. \"Why may I not appoint a\r\ncommittee of good and wise men to watch over the morals of my subjects,\r\nand to warn them from temptation, ere it has time to become sin? Come,\r\nfather, you must aid me in this good work. Help me to be the earthly, as\r\nthe Blessed Virgin is the heavenly mother of the Austrian people. Sketch\r\nme some plan whereby I may organize my scheme. I feel sure that your\r\nsuggestions will be dictated by that Heaven to which you have devoted\r\nyour whole life.\"\r\n\r\n\"May the spirit of counsel and the spirit of wisdom enlighten my\r\nunderstanding,\" said the father, with solemn fervor, \"that I may\r\nworthily accomplish the mission with which my empress has intrusted me!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, your majesty,\" whispered the Countess Fuchs, \"in your magnanimous\r\nprojects for your people, you are losing sight of yourself. The Riccardo\r\nhas not yet been banished; and the emperor, seeing that no answer is\r\ncoming to his note, may seek an interview: Who can guess the\r\nconsequences of a meeting?\"\r\n\r\nThe empress shivered, as the countess probed the wounds herself had made\r\nin that poor, jealous heart.\r\n\r\n\"True, true,\" returned she, in an unsteady voice. \"Go, father, and begin\r\nmy work of reform, by casting out that wicked woman from among the\r\nunhappy wives of Vienna. I myself will announce her departure to the\r\nemperor. And now, dear friends, leave me. You, father, to Count\r\nBartenstein. Countess, recall Charlotte, and send me my tire-women. Let\r\nthe princes and princesses be regally attired to-day. I will meet the\r\nemperor in their midst.\"\r\n\r\nThe confessor bowed and retired, and the countess opening the door of\r\nthe inner dressing-room, beckoned to Charlotte, who, in the recess of a\r\ndeep bay-window, sat wearily awaiting the summons to return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE TOILET OF THE EMPRESS.\r\n\r\nSO dark and gloomy was the face of the empress, that poor Charlotte's\r\nheart misgave her, as with a suppressed sigh she resumed her place, and\r\nonce more took down the rich masses of her sovereign lady's hair. Maria\r\nTheresa looked sternly at the reflection of her little maid of honor's\r\nface in the glass. She saw how Charlotte's hands trembled and this\r\nincreased her ill-humor. Again she raised her eyes to her own image, and\r\nsaw plainly that anger was unbecoming to her. The flush on her face was\r\nnot rosy, but purple; and the scowl upon her brow was fast deepening\r\ninto a wrinkle. Her bosom heaved with a heavy, heavy sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" thought she, \"if I am ever again to find favor in his eyes, I must\r\nalways smile; for smiles are the last glowing tints of beauty's sunset.\r\nAnd yet, how can I smile, when my heart is breaking? He said that the\r\nRiccardo was the loveliest woman he had ever seen. Alas! I remember the\r\nday when he knelt at my feet, and spoke thus of me. Oh, my Franz! Am I\r\nindeed old, and no longer lovable?\"\r\n\r\nIn her anxiety to scrutinize her own features, the empress bent suddenly\r\nforward, and the heavy mass of puffs and braids that formed the coiffure\r\nshe had selected for the day, gave way. She felt the sharp points of the\r\nhair-pins in her head, and, miserable and nervous as she was, they\r\nseemed to wound her cruelly. Starting from her chair, she poured forth a\r\ntorrent of reproaches upon Charlotte's head, who, pale and trembling\r\nmore than ever, repaired the damage, and placed among the braids a\r\nbouquet of white roses. These white roses deepened the unbecoming\r\nredness of the empress's face. She perceived this at once, and losing\r\nall self-control, tore the flowers from her hair, and dashed them on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n\"You are all leagued against me.\" cried she, indignantly. \"You are\r\ntrying your best to disfigure me, and to make me look old before my\r\ntime. Who ever saw such a ridiculous structure as this headdress, that\r\nmakes me look like a perambulating castle on a chessboard? Come, another\r\ncoiffure, and let it not be such a ridiculous one as this.\"\r\n\r\nCharlotte, of course, did not remind her mistress that the coiffure and\r\nroses had been her own selection. She had nothing to do but to obey in\r\nsilence, and begin her work again.\r\n\r\nAt last the painful task was at an end. The empress looked keenly at\r\nherself in the glass, and convinced that she really looked well, she\r\ncalled imperatively for her tire-women. In came the procession, bearing\r\npooped-skirt rich-embroidered train, golden-flowered petticoat, and\r\nbodice flashing with diamonds. But the empress, usually so affable at\r\nher toilet, surveyed both maids and apparel with gloomy indifference. In\r\nmoody silence she reached out her feet, while her slippers were\r\nexchanged for high-heeled shoes. Not a look had she to bestow upon the\r\nmagnificent dress which enhanced a thousandfold her mature beauty.\r\nWithout a word she dismissed the maids of honor, all except Charlotte,\r\nwhose crowning labor it was to give the last touch to the imperial head\r\nwhen the rest of the toilet had been declared to be complete.\r\n\r\nAgain Maria Theresa stood before that high Venetian glass, and certainly\r\nit did give back the image of a regal beauty. For a while she examined\r\nher costume from head to foot; and at last---at last, her beautiful blue\r\neyes beamed bright with satisfaction, and a smile rippled the corners of\r\nher mouth.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said she, aloud. \"No, it is not so. I am neither old nor ugly. The\r\nlight of youth has not yet fled from my brow. My beauty's sun has not\r\nyet set forever. My Franz will love me still; and however charming\r\nyounger women may be, he will remember the beloved of his boyhood, and\r\nwe will yet be happy in reciprocal affection, come what may to us as\r\nemperor and empress. I do not believe that he said he had never seen so\r\nlovely a woman as Riccardo. Poor, dear Franz! He has a tedious life as\r\nhusband of the reigning sovereign. From sheer ennui he sometimes wanders\r\nfrom his wife's heart, but oh! he must, he must return to me; for if I\r\nwere to lose him, earthly splendor would be valueless to me forever!\"\r\n\r\nCharlotte, who stood behind her mistress with the comb in her hand, was\r\ndismayed at all that she heard; and the plaintive tones of this\r\nmagnificent empress, at whose feet lay a world of might, touched her\r\nheart's core. But she sickened as she thought that her presence had been\r\nunheeded, and that the empress had fancied herself alone, while the\r\nsecrets of her heart were thus struggling into words. The ample train\r\ncompletely screened little Charlotte from view, and a deadly paleness\r\noverspread her countenance as she awaited discovery.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the empress turned, and putting her hand tenderly on\r\nCharlotte's head, she said, in a voice of indescribable melancholy \"Be\r\nwarned, Charlotte, and if you marry, never marry a man who has nothing\r\nto do. Men will grow inconstant from sheer ennui.\" [Footnote: Maria\r\nTheresa's words. See Caroline Pichler. \"Memoirs of My Life.\"]\r\n\r\n\"I never expect to marry, beloved mistress,\" said the young girl, deeply\r\ntouched by this confidence. \"I wish to live and die in your majesty's\r\nservice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you? And can you bear for a lifetime with my impatience, dear\r\nchild?\" asked the empress, kissing the little devotee on the forehead.\r\n\"You know now, my little Charlotte, why I have been so unkind to-day;\r\nyou know that my heart was bleeding with such anguish, that had I not\r\nbroken out in anger, I must have stifled with agony. You have seen into\r\nthe depths of my heart, and why should I not confide in you, who know\r\nevery secret of my state-council? No one suspects what misery lies under\r\nthe regal mantle. And I care not to exhibit myself to the world's pity.\r\nWhen Maria Theresa weeps, let her God and those who love her be the\r\nwitnesses of her sorrow. Go, now, good little Charlotte, and forget\r\nevery thing except your sovereign's love for you. Tell the governess of\r\nthe Archduke Ferdinand to bring him hither. Let the other imperial\r\nchildren await me in my reception-room; and tell the page in the\r\nanteroom to announce to his majesty that I request the honor of a visit\r\nfrom him.\"\r\n\r\nCharlotte, once more happy, left the room, her heart filled with joy for\r\nherself, and gentle sorrow for her sovereign.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the empress thought over the coming interview. \"I will try to\r\nrecall him to me by love,\" murmured she, softly. \"I will not reproach\r\nhim, and although as his empress I have a double claim upon his loyalty,\r\nI will not appeal to any thing but his own dear heart; and when he hears\r\nhow he has made his poor Theresa suffer, I know--\"\r\n\r\nHere her voice failed her, and tears filled her eyes. But she dashed\r\nthem quickly away, for steps approached, and the governess entered, with\r\nthe infant prince in her arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nHUSBAND AND WIFE.\r\n\r\nA half an hour later, the princes and princesses of Austria were all\r\nassembled in their mother's private parlor. They were a beautiful group.\r\nThe empress, in their midst, held little Ferdinand in her arms.\r\nClose-peeping through the folds of their mother's rich dress, were three\r\nother little ones; and a few steps farther were the Archduchesses\r\nChristine and Amelia. Near the open harpsichord stood the graceful form\r\nof the empress's eldest child, the Princess Elizabeth, who now and then\r\nran her fingers lightly over the instrument, while she awaited the\r\narrival of her father.\r\n\r\nIn the pride of her maternity and beauty stood the empress-queen; but\r\nher heart throbbed painfully, though she smiled upon her children.\r\n\r\nThe page announced the coming of the emperor, and then left the room.\r\nThe empress made a sign to her eldest daughter, who seated herself\r\nbefore the harpsichord. The door opened, and on the threshold appeared\r\nthe tall, elegant form of the Emperor Francis. Elizabeth began a\r\nbrilliant \"Welcome,\" and all the young voices joined in one loud chorus,\r\n\"Long live our emperor, our sovereign, and our father!\" sang the\r\nchildren; but clear above them all were heard the sonorous tones of the\r\nmother, exclaiming in the fulness of her love, \"Long live my emperor,\r\nand my husband!\" As if every tender chord of Maria Theresa's heart had\r\nbeen struck, she broke forth into one of Metastasio's most passionate\r\nsongs; while Elizabeth, catching the inspiration, accompanied her mother\r\nwith sweetest melody. The empress, her little babe in her arms, was\r\nwrapped up in the ecstasy of the moment. Never had she looked more\r\nenchanting than she did as she ceased, and gave one look of love to her\r\nadmiring husband.\r\n\r\nThe emperor contemplated for a moment the lovely group before him, and\r\nthen, full of emotion, came forward, and bending over his wife, he\r\nkissed the round white arm that held the baby, and whispered to the\r\nmother a few words of rapture at her surpassing beauty.\r\n\r\n\"But tell me, gracious empress,\" said he, aloud, \"to what am I indebted\r\nfor this charming surprise?\"\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the empress shot fire, but instead of a reply, she bent down\r\nto the little Archduchess Josepha, who was just old enough to lisp her\r\nfather's name, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Josepha, tell the emperor what festival we celebrate to-day\" the little\r\none, turning to her father, said, \"To-day is imperial mamma's\r\nwedding-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our wedding-day!\" murmured the emperor, \"and I could forget it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no! my dear husband,\" said the empress, \"I am sure that you cannot\r\nhave forgotten this joyous anniversary. Its remembrance is burned in\r\nyour heart, and the presence of your children here, my trust, has\r\nawakened that remembrance, and carried you back with me to the happy,\r\nhappy days of our early love.\"\r\n\r\nThe voice of the wife was almost tearful, as she spoke those tender\r\nwords; and the emperor, touched and humbled at the thought of his own\r\noversight, sought to change the subject. \"But why,\" asked he, looking\r\naround, \"why, if all our other children are here to greet their father,\r\nis Joseph absent from this happy family gathering?\"\r\n\r\n\"He has been disobedient and obstinate again,\" said the empress, with a\r\nshrug of her shoulders, \"and his preceptor, to punish him, kept him\r\naway\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor walked to the door. \"Surely,\" exclaimed he, \"on such a day\r\nas this, when all my dear children are around me, my son and the future\r\nemperor should be the first to bid me welcome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay, my husband,\" cried the empress, who had no intention of allowing\r\nthe emperor to escape so easily from his embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\"You must be content to remain with us, without the future emperor of\r\nGermany, whose reign, I hope I may be allowed to pray, is yet for some\r\nyears postponed. Or is this a happy device of the future emperor's\r\nfather to remind me, on my wedding-day, that I am growing old enough to\r\nbegin to think of the day of my decease?\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor was perfectly amazed. Although he was accustomed to such\r\noutbursts on the part of his wife, he searched vainly in his heart for\r\nthe cause of her intense bitterness to-day. He looked his astonishment;\r\nand the empress, mindful of her resolve not to reproach him, tried her\r\nbest to smile. The emperor shook his head thoughtfully as he watched her\r\nface, and said half aloud: \"All is not right with thee, Theresa; thou\r\nsmilest like a lioness, not like a woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then,\" said she sharply, \"the lioness has called you to look\r\nupon her whelps. One day they will be lions and lionesses too, and in\r\nthat day they will avenge the injuries of their mother.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress, as she spoke, felt that her smothered jealousy was bursting\r\nforth. She hastily dismissed her children, and going herself to the\r\ndoor, she called for the governess of the baby, and almost threw him in\r\nher arms.\r\n\r\n\"I foresee the coming of a storm,\" thought the emperor, as the door\r\nbeing closed, Maria Theresa came quickly back, and stood before him.\r\n\r\n\"And is it indeed true,\" said she bitterly, \"that you had forgotten your\r\nwedding-day? Not a throb of your heart to remind you of the past!\"\r\n\r\n\"My memory does not cling to dates, Theresa,\" replied the emperor.\r\n\"What, if to-day be accidentally the anniversary of our marriage? With\r\nevery beating of my heart, I celebrate the hour itself, when I won the\r\nproud and beautiful heiress of Austria; and when I remember that she\r\ndeigned to love ME, the poor Archduke of Lorraine, my happiness\r\noverwhelms me. Come, then, my beautiful, my beloved Theresa; come to my\r\nheart, that I may thank you for all the blessings that I owe to your\r\nlove. See, dearest, we are alone; let us forget royalty for to-day, and\r\nbe happy together in all the fulness of mutual confidence and\r\naffection.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he would have pressed her to his heart, but the empress drew\r\ncoldly back, and turned deadly pale. This unembarrassed and confident\r\ntenderness irritated her beyond expression. That her faithless spouse\r\nshould, without the slightest remorse, act the part of the devoted\r\nlover, outraged her very sense of decency.\r\n\r\n\"Really, my husband, it becomes you well to prate of confidence and\r\naffection, who have ceased to think of your own wife, and have eyes\r\nalone for the wife of another!\"\r\n\r\n\"Again jealous?\" sighed the emperor wearily. \"Will you never cease to\r\ncloud our domestic sky by these absurd and groundless suspicions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Groundless!\" cried the empress, tearing the letter violently from her\r\nbosom. \"With this proof of your guilt confronting you, you will not dare\r\nto say that I am jealous without cause!\"\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to inquire of your majesty, what this letter is to prove?\"\r\n\r\n\"It proves that to-day you have written a letter to a woman, of whom\r\nyesterday you said that she was the most beautiful woman in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no recollection of saying such a thing of any woman; and I am\r\nsurprised that your majesty should encourage your attendants to repeat\r\nsuch contemptible tales,\" replied the emperor, with some bitterness.\r\n\"Were I like you, the reigning sovereign of a great empire, I should\r\nreally find no time to indulge in gossip and scandal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty will oblige me by refraining from any comment upon affairs\r\nwhich do not concern you. I alone am reigning empress here, and it is\r\nfor my people to judge whether I do my duty to them; certainly not for\r\nyou, who, while I am with my ministers of state, employ your leisure\r\nhours in writing love-letters to my subjects.\"\r\n\r\n\"I? I write a love-letter?\" said the emperor.\r\n\r\n\"How dare you deny it? \"cried the outraged empress. \"Have you also\r\nforgotten that this morning you sent Gaspardi out of the palace on an\r\nerrand?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I have not forgotten it,\" replied the emperor, with growing\r\nastonishment. But Maria Theresa remarked that he looked confused, and\r\navoided her eye.\r\n\r\n\"You confess, then, that you sent the letter, and requested an answer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I received no answer,\" said the emperor, with embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\"There is your answer,\" thundered the enraged wife. \"I took it from\r\nGaspardi myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is it possible, Theresa, that you have read a letter addressed to\r\nme?\" asked the emperor, in a severe voice.\r\n\r\nThe empress blushed, and her eyes sought the ground.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said she, \"I have not read it, Franz.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is open,\" persisted he, taking it from his wife's hand. \"Who,\r\nthen, has dared to break the seal of a letter addressed to me?\"\r\n\r\nAnd the emperor, usually so mild toward his wife, stood erect, with\r\nstormy brow and eyes flashing with anger.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa in her turn was surprised. She looked earnestly at him,\r\nand confessed inwardly that never had she seen him look so handsome; and\r\nshe felt an inexplicable and secret pleasure that her Franz, for once in\r\nhis life, was really angry with her.\r\n\r\n\"I broke the seal of the letter, but I swear to you that I did not read\r\none word of it,\" replied she. \"I wished to see the signature only, and\r\nthat signature was enough to convince me that I had a faithless husband,\r\nwho outrages an empress by giving her a dancer as her rival!\"\r\n\r\n\"The signature convinced you of this?\" asked the emperor.\r\n\r\n\"It did!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you read nothing else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, I tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, madam,\" returned he, seriously, handing the letter back to her,\r\n\"do me the favor to read the whole of it. After breaking the seal, you\r\nneed not hesitate. I exact it of you.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress looked overwhelmed. \"You exact of me to read a love-letter\r\naddressed to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I do. You took it from my valet, you broke it open, and now I\r\nbeg you will be so good as to read it aloud, for I have not yet read it\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will read it, then,\" cried the empress, scornfully. \"And I promise\r\nyou that I shall not suppress a word of its contents.\"\r\n\r\n\"Read on,\" said the emperor, quietly.\r\n\r\nThe empress, with loud and angry tone, began:\r\n\r\n\"To his Gracious Majesty, the Emperor:\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty has honored me by asking my advice upon a subject of the\r\nhighest importance. But your majesty is much nearer the goal than I. It\r\nis true that my gracious master, the count, led me to the vestibule of\r\nthe temple of science, but further I have not penetrated. What I know I\r\nwill joyfully impart to your majesty; and joyfully will I aid you in\r\nyour search after that which the whole world is seeking. I will come at\r\nthe appointed hour.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty's loyal servant,\r\n\r\n\"RICCARDO.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand a word,\" said the mystified empress.\r\n\r\n\"But I do,\" returned the emperor, with a meaning smile. \"Since your\r\nmajesty has thrust yourself into the portals of my confidence, I must\r\ne'en take you with me into the penetralia, and confess at once that I\r\nhave a passion, which has cost me many a sleepless night, and has\r\npreoccupied my thoughts, even when I was by your majesty's side.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I see nothing of love or passion in this letter,\" replied Maria\r\nTheresa, glancing once more at its singular contents.\r\n\r\n\"And yet it speaks of nothing else. I may just as well confess, too,\r\nthat in pursuit of the object of my love, I have spent three hundred\r\nthousand guilders, and thrown away at least one hundred thousand\r\nguilders' worth of diamonds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your mistress must be either very coy or very grasping,\" said Maria\r\nTheresa, almost convulsed with jealousy.\r\n\r\n\"She is very coy,\" said the emperor. \"All my gold and diamonds have won\r\nme not a smile--she will not yield up her secret. But I believe that she\r\nhas responded to the love of one happy mortal, Count Saint-Germain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Count Saint-Germain!\" exclaimed the empress, amazed.\r\n\r\n\"Himself, your majesty. He is one of the fortunate few, to whom the coy\r\nbeauty has succumbed; and to take his place I would give millions. Now,\r\nI heard yesterday that the confidant of the count was in Vienna; and,\r\nhoping to learn something from him, I invited him hither. Signor\r\nRiccardo--\"\r\n\r\n\"SIGNOR Riccardo! Was this letter written by a man?\"\r\n\r\n\"By the husband of the dancer.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your letter was addressed to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Even so, madame.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then this passion of which you speak is your old passion--alchemy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is. I had promised you to give it up, but it proves stronger\r\nthan I. Not to annoy you, I have ever since worked secretly in my\r\nlaboratory. I have just conceived a new idea. I am about to try the\r\nexperiment of consolidating small diamonds into one large one, by means\r\nof a burning-glass.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress answered this with a hearty, happy laugh, and went up to her\r\nhusband with outstretched hands.\r\n\r\n\"Franz,\" said she, \"I am a simpleton; and all that has been for\r\ntormenting in my heart is sheer nonsense. My crown does not prevent me\r\nfrom being a silly woman. But, my heart's love, forgive my folly for the\r\nsake of my affection.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of responding to this appeal, the emperor stood perfectly still,\r\nand gazed earnestly and seriously at his wife.\r\n\r\n\"Your jealousy,\" said he, after a moment's silence, \"I freely forgive,\r\nfor it is a source of more misery to you than to me. But this jealousy\r\nhas attacked my honor as a man, and that I cannot forgive. As reigning\r\nempress, I render you homage, and am content to occupy the second pace\r\nin Austria's realms. I will not deny that such a rule is irksome to me,\r\nfor I, like you, have lofty dreams of ambition; and I could have wished\r\nthat, in giving me the TITLE, you had allowed me sometimes the\r\nprivileges of a co-regent. But I have seen that my co-regency irritated\r\nand annoyed you; I have, therefore, renounced all thought of governing\r\nempires. I have done this, not only because I love you, Theresa, but\r\nbecause you are worthy by your intellect to govern your people without\r\nmy help. In the world, therefore, I am known as the husband of the\r\nreigning empress; but at home I am lord of my own household, and here I\r\nreign supreme. The emperor may be subordinate to his sovereign, but the\r\nman will acknowledge no superior; and the dignity of his manhood shall\r\nbe respected, even by yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven forbid that I should ever seek to wound it!\" exclaimed Maria\r\nTheresa, while she gazed with rapture upon her husband's noble\r\ncountenance, and thought that never had he looked so handsome as at this\r\nmoment, when, for the first time, he asserted his authority against\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\"You HAVE wounded it, your majesty,\" replied the emperor, with emphasis.\r\n\"You have dogged my steps with spies; you have suffered my character to\r\nbe discussed by your attendants. You have gone so far as to compromise\r\nme with my own servants; forcing them to disobey me by virtue of your\r\nrights as sovereign exercised in opposition to mine as your husband. I\r\ngave Gaspardi orders to deliver Riccardo's note to me alone. I forbade\r\nhim to tell any one whither he went. YOU took my note from him by force,\r\nand committed the grave wrong of compelling a servant, hitherto\r\nfaithful, to disobey and betray his master.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did indeed wrong you, dear Franz,\" said the empress, already\r\npenitent. \"In Gaspardi's presence I will ask your pardon for my\r\nindelicate intrusion, and before him I will bear witness to his\r\nfidelity. I alone was to blame. I promise you, too, to sin no more\r\nagainst you, my beloved, for your love is the brightest jewel in my\r\ncrown. Without it, no happiness would grandeur give to me. Forgive me,\r\nthen, my own Franz--forgive your unhappy Theresa!\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, she inclined her head toward her husband, and looked up to\r\nhim with such eyes of love, that he could but gaze enraptured upon her\r\nbewitching beauty.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Franz, come!\" said she tenderly; \"surely, that wicked jest of\r\nyours has amply revenged you. Be satisfied with having given me a\r\nheartache for jealousy of the coy mistress upon whom you have wasted\r\nyour diamonds, and be magnanimous.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, Theresa?--will you be magnanimous also? Will you leave my\r\nservants and my letters alone, and set no more spies to dog my steps?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, Franz, I will never behave as I have done to-day, while we both\r\nlive. Now, if you will sign my pardon, I will tell you a piece of news\r\nwith which I intend shortly to surprise all Austria.\"\r\n\r\n\"Out with it, then, and if it is good news I sign the pardon,\" said the\r\nemperor, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"It is excellent news,\" cried the empress, \"for it will give new life to\r\nAustria. It will bring down revenge upon our enemies, and revenge upon\r\nthat wicked infidel who took my beautiful Silesia from me, and who,\r\nboasting of his impiety, calls it enlightenment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you not yet forgiven Frederick for that little bit of Silesia that\r\nhe stole from you?\" asked the emperor, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"No, I have not yet forgiven him, nor do I ever expect to do so. I owe\r\nit to him, that, years ago, I came like a beggar before the Magyars to\r\nwhimper for help and defence. I have never yet forgotten the humiliation\r\nof that day, Franz.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet, Theresa, we must confess that Frederick is a great man, and it\r\nwere well for Austria if we were allies; for such an alliance would\r\nsecure the blessings of a stable peace to Europe.\"\r\n\r\n\"It cannot be,\" cried the empress. \"There is no sympathy between Austria\r\nand Prussia, and peace will never come to Europe until one succumbs to\r\nthe other. No dependence is to be placed upon alliances between\r\nincongruous nations. In spite of our allies, the English, the Dutch, and\r\nthe Russians, the King of Prussia has robbed me of my province; and all\r\nthe help I have ever got from them was empty condolence. For this reason\r\nI have sought for alliance with another power--a power which will\r\ncordially unite with me in crushing that hateful infidel, to whom\r\nnothing in life is sacred. This is the news that I promised you. Our\r\ntreaty with England and Holland is about to expire, and the new ally I\r\nhave found for Austria is France.\"\r\n\r\n\"An alliance with France is not a natural one for Austria, and can never\r\nbe enduring,\" exclaimed the emperor. [Footnote: The emperor's own words.\r\nCoxe, \"History of the House of Austria,\" vol. v., p. 67.]\r\n\r\n\"It WILL be enduring,\" cried Maria Theresa, proudly, \"for it is equally\r\ndesired by both nations. Not only Louis XV., but the Marquise de\r\nPompadour is impatient to have the treaty signed.\"\r\n\r\n\"That means that Kaunitz has been flattering the marquise, and the\r\nmarquise, Kaunitz. But words are not treaties, and the marquise's\r\npromises are of no consequence whatever.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Franz, I tell you that we have gone further than words. Of this,\r\nhowever, no one knows, except the King of France, myself, Kaunitz, and\r\nthe marquise.\"\r\n\r\n\"How in the world did you manage to buy the good-will of the marquise?\r\nHow many millions did you pay for the precious boon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a kreutzer, dear husband, only a letter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Letter! Letter from whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"A letter from me to the marquise.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" cried the emperor, laughing. \"You write to La Pompadour--YOU,\r\nTheresa?\"\r\n\r\n\"With my own hand, I have written to her, and more than once,\" returned\r\nMaria Theresa, joining in the laugh. \"And what do you suppose I did, to\r\nsave my honor in the matter? I pretended to think that she was the wife\r\nof the king, and addressed her as 'Madame, ma soeur et cousine.'\"\r\n\r\nHere the emperor laughed immoderately. \"Well, well!\" exclaimed he. \"So\r\nthe Empress-Queen of Austria and Hungary writes with her own hand to her\r\nbeloved cousin La Pompadour!\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you know what she calls me?\" laughed the empress in return.\r\n\"Yesterday I had a letter from her in which she calls me, sportively,\r\n'Ma chere reine.'\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor broke out into such a volley of laughter, that he threw\r\nhimself back upon a chair, which broke under him, and the empress had to\r\ncome to his assistance, for he was too convulsed to get up alone.\r\n[Footnote: Historical.]\r\n\r\n\"Oh dear! oh dear!\" groaned the emperor, still continuing to laugh. \"I\r\nshall die of this intelligence. Maria Theresa in correspondence with\r\nMadame d'Etoiles!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what of it, Franz?\" asked Maria Theresa. \"Did I not write to the\r\nprima donna Farinelli when we were seeking alliance with Spain? and is\r\nthe marquise not as good as a soprano singer?\" [Footnote: The empress's\r\nown words. Coxe, vol. v., p. 69.]\r\n\r\nThe emperor looked at her with such a droll expression that she gave up\r\nall idea of defending herself from ridicule, and laughed as heartily as\r\nhe did.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a page knocked, and announced the Archduke Joseph and his\r\npreceptor.\r\n\r\n\"Poor lad!\" said the emperor; \"I suppose he comes, as usual, accompanied\r\nby an accuser.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE ARCHDUKE JOSEPH.\r\n\r\nThe emperor was right; Father Francis came in with complaints of his\r\nhighness. While the father with great pathos set forth the reason of the\r\narchduke's absence from the family circle, the culprit stood by,\r\napparently indifferent to all that was being said. But, to any one\r\nobserving him closely, his tremulous mouth, and the short, convulsive\r\nsighs, which he vainly strove to repress, showed the real anxiety of his\r\nfast-beating heart. He thrust back his rising tears, for the little\r\nprince teas too proud to crave sympathy; and he had already learned how\r\nto hide emotion by a cold and haughty bearing. From his childhood he had\r\nborne a secret sorrow in his heart--the sorrow of seeing his young\r\nbrother Carl preferred to himself. Not only was Carl the darling of his\r\nparents, but he was the pet and plaything of the whole palace. True, the\r\npoor little archduke was not gifted with the grace and charming naivete\r\nof his brother. He was awkward, serious, and his countenance wore an\r\nexpression of discontent, which was thought to betray an evil\r\ndisposition, but which, in reality, was but the reflection of the heavy\r\nsorrow which clouded his young heart. No one seemed to understand--no\r\none seemed to love him. Alone in the midst of that gay and splendid\r\ncourt, he was never noticed except to be chided. [Footnote: Hubner,\r\n\"Life of Joseph II.,\" page 15.] The buds of his poor young heart were\r\nblighted by the mildew of neglect, so that outwardly he was cold,\r\nsarcastic, and sullen, while inwardly he glowed with a thousand\r\nemotions, which he dared reveal to no one, for no one seemed to dream\r\nthat he was capable of feeling them.\r\n\r\nTo-day, as usual, he was brought before his parents as a culprit; and\r\nwithout daring to utter a word in his own defence, he stood by, while\r\nFather Francis told how many times he had yawned over the \"Lives of the\r\nMartyrs;\" and how he had refused to read, longer than one hour, a most\r\nedifying commentary of the Fathers on the Holy Scriptures.\r\n\r\nThe empress heard with displeasure of her son's lack of piety; and she\r\nlooked severely at him, while he gazed sullenly at a portrait that hung\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\n\"And can it be, my son,\" exclaimed she, \"that you close your heart\r\nagainst the word of God, and refuse to read religious books?\"\r\n\r\nThe boy gave her a glance of defiance. \"I do not know,\" said he,\r\ncarelessly, \"whether the books are religious or not; but I know that\r\nthey are tiresome, and teach me nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gracious Heaven!\" cried the empress, with horror, \"hear the impious\r\nchild!\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather, your majesty,\" said Father Francis, \"let us pray Heaven to\r\nsoften his heart.\" The emperor alone said nothing; but he looked at the\r\nboy with a friendly and sympathizing glance. The child saw the look, and\r\nfor one moment a flush of pleasure passed over his face. He raised his\r\neyes with an appealing expression toward his father, who could no longer\r\nresist the temptation of coming to his relief.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" suggested he, \"the books may be dull to a child of Joseph's\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\n\"No book,\" returned the empress, \"should be dull that treats of God and\r\nof His holy Church.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the work, your majesty, which we were reading, was a most learned\r\nand celebrated treatise,\" said Father Francis; \"one highly calculated to\r\nedify and instruct youth.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph turned away from the father, and spoke to the emperor.\r\n\r\n\"We have already gone through five volumes of it, your majesty, and I am\r\ntired to death of it. Moreover, I don't believe half that I read in his\r\nstupid books.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress, as she heard this, uttered a cry of pain. She felt an icy\r\ncoldness benumb her heart, as she remembered that this unbelieving boy\r\nwas one day to succeed her on the throne of Austria. The emperor, too,\r\nwas pained. By the deadly paleness of her face, he guessed the pane that\r\nwas rending his wife's heart, and he dared say no more in defence of his\r\nson.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty sees,\" continued Father Francis, \"how far is the heart of\r\nhis highness from God and the Church. His instructors are grieved at his\r\nprecocious unbelief, and they are this day to confer together upon the\r\npainful subject. The hour of the conference is at hand, and I crave your\r\nmajesty's leave to repair thither.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the empress, with a deprecating gesture; \"no. Remain, good\r\nfather. Let this conference he held in the presence of the emperor and\r\nmyself. It is fitting that we both know the worst in regard to our\r\nchild.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor bowed acquiescence, and crossing the room, took a seat by\r\nthe side of the empress.\r\n\r\nHe rang a little golden bell; and the page who came at the summons, was\r\nordered to request the attendance of the preceptors of his highness the\r\nCrown Prince of Austria.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa leaned her head upon her hand, and with a sad and\r\nperplexed countenance watched the open door. The emperor, with his arm\r\nthrown over the gilded back of the divan, looked earnestly at the young\r\nculprit, who, pale, and with a beating heart, was trying his best to\r\nsuppress his increasing emotion.\r\n\r\n\"I will not cry,\" thought he, scarcely able to restrain his tears; \"for\r\nthat would be a triumph for my detestable teachers. I am not going to\r\ngive them the pleasure of knowing that I am miserable.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, by dint of great exertion, he mastered his agitation. He was so\r\nsuccessful, that he did not move a muscle nor turn his head when the\r\nsolemn procession of his accusers entered the room.\r\n\r\nFirst, at the head, came Father Porhammer, who gave him lessons in logic\r\nand physic; after him walked the engineer Briguen, professor of\r\nmathematics; then Herr von Leporini, who instructed him in general\r\nhistory; Herrvson Bartenstein, who expounded the political history of\r\nthe house of Austria; Baron von Beck, who was his instructor in\r\njudicature; and finally, his governor, Count Bathiany, the only one\r\ntoward whom the young prince felt a grain of good-will.\r\n\r\nThe empress greeted them with grave courtesy, and exhorted them to say\r\nwithout reserve before his parents what they thought of the progress and\r\ndisposition of the archduke.\r\n\r\nCount Bathiany, with an encouraging smile directed toward his pupil,\r\nassured their majesties that the archduke was anxious to do right--not\r\nbecause he was told so to do by others, but because he followed the\r\ndictates of his own conscience. True, his highness would not see through\r\nthe eyes of any other person; but this, though it might be a defect in a\r\nchild, would be the reverse in a man--above all, in a sovereign. \"In\r\nproof of the archduke's sincere desire to do right,\" continued Count\r\nBathiany, \"allow me to repeat to your majesties something which he said\r\nto me yesterday. We were reading together Bellegarde on knowledge of\r\nself and of human nature. The beautiful thoughts of the author so\r\ntouched the heart of his highness, that, stopping suddenly, he exclaimed\r\nto me, 'We must read this again; for when I come to the throne I shall\r\nneed to know, not only myself, but other men also.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Well said, my son!\" exclaimed the emperor.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot agree with your majesty,\" said the empress, coldly. \"_I_ do\r\nnot think it praiseworthy for a child of his age to look forward with\r\ncomplacency to the day when his mother's death will confer upon him a\r\nthrone. To rile it would seem more natural if Joseph thought more of his\r\npresent duties and less of his future honors.\"\r\n\r\nA breathless silence followed these bitter words. The emperor, in\r\nconfusion, withdrew behind the harpsichord. The archduke looked\r\nperfectly indifferent. While Count Bathiany had been repeating his\r\nwords, his face had slightly flushed; but when he heard the sharp\r\nreproof of his mother, he raised his head, and gave her back another\r\ndefiant look. With the same sullen haughtiness, he stared first at one\r\naccuser, and then at another, while each one in his turn gave judgment\r\nagainst him. First, and most vehement in his denunciations, was Count\r\nBartenstein. He denounced the archduke as idle and inattentive. He never\r\nwould have any political sagacity whatever. Why, even the great work, in\r\nfifteen folios, which he (Count Bartenstein) had compiled from the\r\nimperial archives for the especial instruction of the prince, even THAT\r\nfailed to interest him! [Footnote: Hormayer says that this book was\r\nheavy and filled with tiresome details. (No wonder! In fifteen\r\nfolios.--Trane.)]\r\n\r\nThen followed the rest of their professorships. One complained of\r\ndisrespect; another of carelessness; a third of disobedience; a fourth\r\nof irreligion. All concurred in declaring the archduke to be obstinate,\r\nunfeeling, and intractable.\r\n\r\nHis face, meanwhile, grew paler and harder, until it seemed almost to\r\nstiffen into marble. Although every censorious word went like a dagger\r\nto his sensitive heart, he still kept on murmuring to himself, \"I will\r\nnot cry, I will not cry.\"\r\n\r\nHis mother divined nothing of the agony which, like a wild tornado, was\r\ndesolating the fair face of her child's whole being. She saw nothing\r\nbeyond the portals of that cold and sullen aspect, and the sight filled\r\nher with sorrow and anger.\r\n\r\n\"Alas,\" cried she bitterly, \"you are right! He is a refractory and\r\nunfeeling boy.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment, like the voice of a conciliatory angel, were heard the\r\nsoft tones of the melody with which the empress had greeted her husband\r\nthat morning. It was the emperor, whose hands seemed unconsciously to\r\nwander over the keys of the harpsichord, while every head bent entranced\r\nto listen.\r\n\r\nWhen the first tones of the heavenly melody fell upon his ear, the young\r\nprince began to tremble. His features softened; his lips, so scornfully\r\ncompressed, now parted, as if to drink in every sound; his eyes filled\r\nwith tears, and every angry feeling of his heart was hushed by the magic\r\nof music. With a voice of love it seemed to call him, and unable to\r\nresist its power and its pathos, he burst into a flood of tears, and\r\nwith one bound reached his father's arms, sobbing--\r\n\r\n\"Father, dear father, pity me!\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor drew the poor boy close to his heart. He kissed his blond\r\ncurls, and whispering, said: \"Dear child, I knew that you were not\r\nheartless. I was sure that you would come when your father called.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress had started from her seat, and she now stood in the centre\r\nof the room, earnestly gazing upon her husband and her child. Her\r\nmother's heart beat wildly, and tears of tenderness suffused her eyes.\r\nShe longed to speak some word of pardon to her son; but before all\r\nthings, Maria Theresa honored court ceremony. She would not, for the\r\nworld, that her subjects had seen her otherwise than self-possessed and\r\nregal in her bearing.\r\n\r\nWith one great effort she mastered her emotions; and before the strength\r\nof her will, the mighty flood rolled back upon her heart. Not a tear\r\nthat glistened in her eyelids fell; not a tone of her clear, silvery\r\nvoice was heard to falter.\r\n\r\n\"Count Bathiany,\" said she, \"I perceive that in the education of the\r\narchduke, the humanizing influences of music have been overlooked. Music\r\nto-day has been more powerful with him than filial love or moral\r\nobligation. Select for him, then, a skilful teacher, who will make use\r\nof his art to lead my son back to duty and religion.\" [Footnote: Maria\r\nTheresa's own words. Coxe, \"House of Austria,\" vol. v.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nKAUNITZ.\r\n\r\nThree weeks had elapsed since the memorable sitting at which Maria\r\nTheresa had declared in favor of a new line of policy. Three long weeks\r\nhad gone by, and still no message came for Kaunitz; and still\r\nBartenstein and Uhlefeld held the reins of power.\r\n\r\nWith hasty steps, Kaunitz paced the floor of his study. Gone was all\r\ncoldness and impassibility from his face. His eyes glowed with restless\r\nfire, and his features twitched nervously.\r\n\r\nHis secretary, who sat before the writing-table, had been gazing\r\nanxiously at the count for sometime. He shook his head gloomily, as he\r\ncontemplated the strange sight of Kaunitz, agitated and disturbed.\r\n\r\nKaunitz caught the eye of his confidant, and coming hastily toward the\r\ntable, he stood for a few moments without speaking a word. Suddenly he\r\nburst into a loud, harsh laugh--a laugh so bitter, so sardonic, that\r\nBaron Binder turned pale as he heard the sound.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you so pale, Binder?\" asked Kaunitz, still laughing. \"Why do\r\nyou start as if you had received an electric shock?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your laughing is like an electric shock to my heart,\" replied the\r\nbaron. \"Its sound was enough to make a man pale. Why, for ten years I\r\nhave lived under your roof, and never have I heard you laugh before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you are right, Binder, for in sooth my laugh echoes gloomily\r\nwithin the walls of my own heart. But I could not help it--you had such\r\na droll, censorious expression on your face.\"\r\n\r\n\"No wonder,\" returned Baron Binder. \"It vexes me to see a statesman so\r\nirresolute and unmanned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Statesman!\" exclaimed Kaunitz, bitterly. \"Who knows whether my role of\r\nstatesman is not played out already?\"\r\n\r\nHe resumed his walk in moody silence, while Binder followed him with his\r\neyes. Suddenly Kaunitz stopped again before the table. \"Baron,\" said he,\r\n\"you have known me intimately for ten years. In all my embassies you\r\nhave been with me as attache. Since we have lived together, have you\r\never known me to be faint-hearted?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" cried the baron, \"never! I have seen you brave the anger of\r\nmonarchs, the hatred of enemies, the treachery of friends and\r\nmistresses. I have stood by your side in more than one duel, and never\r\nbefore have I seen you otherwise than calm and resolute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Judge, then, how sickening to me is this suspense, since, for the first\r\ntime in my life, I falter. Oh! I tremble lest--\"\r\n\r\n\"Lest what?\" asked the baron, with interest.\r\n\r\n\"Binder, I fear that Maria Theresa may prove less an empress than a\r\nwoman. I fear that the persuasions of the handsome Francis of Lorraine\r\nmay outweigh her own convictions of right. What if her husband's\r\ncaresses, her confessor's counsel, or her own feminine caprice, should\r\nblind her to the welfare of her subjects and the interest of her empire?\r\nOh, what a giant structure will fall to the earth, if, at this crisis,\r\nthe empress should fail me! Think what a triumph it would be to dash\r\naside my rivals and seize the helm of state to gather, upon the deck of\r\none stout ship, all the paltry principalities that call themselves\r\n'Austria;' to band them into one consolidated nation; and then to steer\r\nthis noble ship into a haven of greatness and glorious peace! Binder, to\r\nthis end alone I live. I have outlived all human illusions. I have no\r\nfaith in love--it is bought and sold. No faith in the tears of men; none\r\nin their smiles. Society, to me, is one vast mad house. If, in its\r\nfrenzied walls, I show that I am sane, the delirious throng will shout\r\nout, 'Seize the lunatic!' Therefore must I seem as mad as they, and\r\ntherefore it is that, outside of this study, I commit a thousand\r\nfollies. In such a world I have no faith; but, Binder, I believe in\r\ndivine ambition. It is the only passion that has ever stirred my\r\nheart--the only passion worthy to fill the soul of a MAN! My only love,\r\nthen, ambition. My only dream is of power. Oh! that I might eclipse and\r\noutlive the names of my rivals! But alas! alas! I fear that the\r\ngreatness of Kaunitz will be wrecked upon the shoals of Maria Theresa's\r\nshallowness!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said the baron vehemently. \"Fear nothing, Kaunitz; you are the\r\nman who is destined to make Austria great, and to disperse the clouds of\r\nignorance that darken the minds of her people.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may be sure that if ever I attain power, Binder, nor church nor\r\nchurchman shall have a voice in Austria. Kaunitz alone shall reign. But\r\nwill Maria Theresa consent? Will she ever have strength of mind to burst\r\nthe shackles with which silly love and silly devotion have bound her? I\r\nfear not. Religion--\"\r\n\r\nHere the door opened, and the count's valet handed a card to the\r\nsecretary.\r\n\r\n\"A visit from Count Bartenstein!\" exclaimed the baron triumphantly. \"Ah!\r\nI knew--\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you receive him here, in the study?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will receive him nowhere,\" replied Kaunitz coldly. \"Say to the\r\ncount,\" added he to the valet, \"that I am engaged, and beg to be\r\nexcused.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! You deny yourself to the prime minister?\" cried Binder,\r\nterrified.\r\n\r\nKaunitz motioned to the servant to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\"Binder,\" said he exultingly, \"do you not see from this visit that MY\r\nday is about to dawn, and that Bartenstein is the first lark to greet\r\nthe rising sun? His visit proves that he feels a presentiment of his\r\nfall and my rebuff shall verify it. The whole world will understand that\r\nwhen Bartenstein was turned away from my door, I gave old Austria, as\r\nwell as himself, a parting kick. Away with anxiety and fear! The deluge\r\nis over, and old Bartenstein has brought me the olive-branch that\r\nannounces dry land and safety.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear count!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Binder, dry land and safety. Now we will be merry, and lift our\r\nhead high up into clouds of Olympic revel! Away with your deeds and your\r\nparchments! We are no longer bookworms, but butterflies. Let us sport\r\namong the roses!\"\r\n\r\nWhile Kaunitz spoke, he seized a hand-bell from the table, and rang\r\nvehemently.\r\n\r\n\"Make ready for me in my dressing-room,\" said he to the valet. \"Let the\r\ncook prepare a costly dinner for twenty persons. Let the steward select\r\nthe rarest wines in the cellar. Tell him to see that the Champagne is\r\nnot too warm, nor the Johannisberg to cold; the Sillery too dry, nor the\r\nLachryma Christi too acid. Order two carriages, and send one for Signora\r\nFerlina, and the other for Signora Sacco. Send two footmen to Counts\r\nHarrach and Colloredo, with my compliments. Stay--here is a list of the\r\nother guests. Send a messenger to the apartments of my sister, the\r\ncountess. Tell her, with my respects, to oblige me by dining to-day in\r\nher own private rooms. I will not need her to preside over my\r\ndinner-table to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my lord,\" stammered the valet, \"the countess--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--what of her?\"\r\n\r\n\"The countess has been de--gone for a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gone, without taking leave? Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"There, my lord,\" replied the valet in a low voice, pointing upward\r\ntoward heaven.\r\n\r\n\"What does he mean, Binder?\" asked Kaunitz, with a shrug.\r\n\r\nBinder shrugged responsive.\r\n\r\n\"The good countess,\" said he, \"had been ill for some time, but did not\r\nwish to disturb you. You must have been partially prepared for the\r\nmelancholy event, for the countess has not appeared at table for three\r\nweeks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me? Not at all. Do you suppose that during these last three weeks I\r\nhave had time to think of her? I never remarked her absence. When did\r\nthe--the--ceremony take place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Day before yesterday. I attended to every thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear friend, how I thank you for sparing me the sight of these\r\nhideous rites! Your arrangements must have been exquisite, for I never\r\nso much as suspected the thing. Fortunately, it is all over, and we can\r\nenjoy ourselves as usual. Here, Philip. Let the house look festive:\r\nflowers on the staircases and in the entrance-hall; oranges and roses in\r\nthe dining-room; vanilla-sticks in the coffee-cups instead of teaspoons.\r\nAway with you!\"\r\n\r\nThe valet bowed, and when he was out of hearing Kaunitz renewed his\r\nthanks to the baron.\r\n\r\n\"Once more, thank you for speeding my sister on her journey, and for\r\nsaving me all knowledge of this unpleasant affair. How glad the signoras\r\nwill be to hear that the countess has positively gone, never to return!\r\nWhom shall I get to replace her? Well, never mind now; some other time\r\nwe'll settle that little matter. Now to my toilet.\"\r\n\r\nHe bent his head to the baron, and with light, elastic step passed into\r\nhis dressing-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE TOILET.\r\n\r\nWhen Kaunitz entered his dressing-room, his features had resumed their\r\nusual immobility. He walked in, without seeming to be aware of the\r\npresence of his attendants, who, ranged on either side of the apartment,\r\nawaited his commands.\r\n\r\nHe went up to his large Venetian mirror, and there surveyed himself at\r\nfull length. With anxious glance his keen eyes sought out every faint\r\nline that told of the four-and-thirty years of his life. The picture\r\nseemed deeply interesting, for he stood a long time before the glass.\r\nAlt last the scrutiny was ended, and he turned slightly toward the\r\nhair-dresser.\r\n\r\n\"Is the peruke ready?\"\r\n\r\nThe hair-dresser fluttered off to a bandbox, that lay on the\r\ntoilet-table; and lifted out a fantastic-looking blond peruke,\r\nconstructed after \"his excellency's own design.\" Kaunitz was not aware\r\nof it, but this wig of his, with its droll mixture of flowing locks\r\nbefore, and prim purse behind, was an exact counterpart of the life and\r\ncharacter of its inventor. He had had no intention of being symbolic in\r\nhis contrivance; it had been solely designed to conceal the little\r\ntell-tale lines that were just about to indent the smooth surface of his\r\nwhite forehead. He bent his proud head, while the hair-dresser placed\r\nthe wonderful wig, and then fell to studying its effect. Here he drew a\r\ncurl forward, there he gently removed another; placing each one in its\r\nposition over his eyebrows, so that no treacherous side-light should\r\nreveal any thing he chose to hide. Finally the work was done.\r\n\"Hippolyte,\" said he, to the hair-dresser, who stood breathlessly by,\r\n\"this is the way in which my wig is to be dressed from this day\r\nforward.\" [Footnote: From this time Kaunitz wore his wig in this\r\neccentric fashion. It was adopted by the exquisites of Vienna, and\r\ncalled \"the Kaunitz peruke.\"]\r\n\r\nHippolyte bowed low, and stepped back to give place to the valets who\r\ncame in with the count's costume. One bore a rich habit embroidered with\r\ngold, and the other a pair of velvet-shorts, red stockings, and\r\ndiamond-buckled shoes.\r\n\r\n\"A simpler habit--Spanish, without embroidery, and white stockings.\"\r\n\r\nWhite stockings! The valets were astounded at such high treason against\r\nthe court regulations of Vienna. But Kaunitz, with a slight and\r\ncontemptuous shrug, ordered them a second time to bring him white\r\nstockings, and never to presume to bring any other.\r\n\r\n\"Now, go and await me in the puderkammer.\" [Footnote: Literally,\r\n\"powder-room.\"]\r\n\r\nThe valets backed out as if in the presence of royalty, and the\r\neccentric statesman was left with his chief valet. The toilet was\r\ncompleted in solemn silence. Then, the count walked to the mirror to\r\ntake another look at his adored person. He gave a complaisant stroke to\r\nhis ruff of richest Alencon, smoothed the folds of his habit, carefully\r\narranged the lace frills that fell over his white hands, and then\r\nturning to his valet he said, \"Powder-mantle.\"\r\n\r\nThe valet unfolded a little package, and, with preter-careful hands,\r\ndropped a long white mantle over the shoulders of the ministerial\r\ncoxcomb. Is light folds closed around him, and, with an Olympian nod, he\r\nturned toward the door, while the valet flew to open it. As soon as the\r\ncount appeared, the other valets, who, with the hair-dresser, stood on\r\neither side of the room, raised each one a long brush dipped in\r\nhair-powder, and waved it to and fro. Clouds of white dust filled the\r\nroom; while through the mist, with grave and deliberate gait, walked\r\nKaunitz, every now and then halting, when the brushes all stopped; then\r\ngiving the word of command, they all fell vigorously to work again. Four\r\ntimes he went through the farce, and then, grave as a ghost, walked back\r\nto his dressing-room, followed by the hair-dresser.\r\n\r\nAt the door, the chief valet carefully removed the powder-mantle, and\r\nfor the third time Raunitz turned to the mirror. Then he carefully wiped\r\nthe powder from his eyes, and, with a smile of extreme satisfaction he\r\nturned to the hair-dresser.\r\n\r\n\"Confess, Hippolyte, that nothing is more beautifying than powder. See\r\nhow exquisitely it lies on the front ringlets, and how airily it is\r\ndistributed over the entire peruke. Vraiment, I am proud of my\r\ninvention.\"\r\n\r\nHippolyte protested that it was worthy of the godlike intellect of his\r\nexcellency, and was destined to make an era in the annals of\r\nhair-dressing.\r\n\r\n\"The annals of hair-dressing,\" replied his excellency, \"are not to be\r\nenriched with any account of my method of using powder. If ever I hear a\r\nword of this discovery breathed outside of these rooms, I dismiss the\r\nwhole pack of you. Do you hear?\"\r\n\r\nDown went the obsequious heads, while Kaunitz continued, with his fine\r\ncambric handkerchief, to remove the last specks of powder from his\r\neyelids. When he had sufficiently caressed and admired himself, he went\r\nto the door. It opened, and two valets, who stood outside, presented\r\nhim, one with a jewelled snuff-box, the other with an embroidered\r\nhandkerchief. A large brown dog, that lay couchant in the hall, rose and\r\nfollowed him, and the last act of the daily farce was over.\r\n\r\nThe count passed into his study, and going at once to the table, he\r\nturned over the papers. \"No message yet from the empress,\" said he,\r\nchagrined. \"What if Bartenstein's visit was NOT a politic, but a\r\ntriumphant one? What a--\"\r\n\r\nHere the door opened, and Baron Binder entered. \"Your excellency,\" said\r\nhe, smiling, \"I have taken upon myself to bear you a message which your\r\nservants declined to bring. It is to announce a visitor. The hour for\r\nreception has gone by, but he was so urgent, that I really could not\r\nrefuse his entreaties that you might be told of his presence. Pardon my\r\nofficiousness, but you know how soft-hearted I am. I never could resist\r\nimportunity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is your suppliant friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"Count Bartenstein, my lord.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bartenstein! Bartenstein back already!\" exclaimed Kaunitz, exultingly.\r\n\"And he begged--he begged for an interview, you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Begged! the word is faint to express his supplications.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I am not mistaken!\" cried Kaunitz, with a loud, triumphant voice:\r\n\"if Bartenstein begs, it is all over with him. Twice in my anteroom in\r\none day! That is equivalent to a message from the empress.\" And Kaunitz,\r\nnot caring to dissimulate with Binder, gave vent to his exceeding joy.\r\n\r\n\"And you will be magnanimous--you will see him, will you not?\" asked\r\nBinder, imploringly.\r\n\r\n\"What for?\" asked the heartless statesman. \"If he means business, the\r\ncouncil-chamber is the place for THAT; if he comes to visit ME--'I beg\r\nto be excused.'\"\r\n\r\n\"But when I beg you, for MY sake, count,\" persisted the good-natured\r\nbaron; \"the sight of fallen greatness is such a painful one! How can any\r\none add to it a feather's weight of anguish?\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz laid his hands upon the broad shoulders of his friend, and in\r\nhis eye there kindled something like a ray of affection.\r\n\r\n\"Grown-up child, your heart is as soft as if it had never been breathed\r\nupon by the airs of this wicked world. Say no more about Bartenstein,\r\nand I will reward your interest in his misfortune by making you his\r\nsuccessor. You shall be state referendarius yourself. Come along, you\r\nchicken-hearted statesman, and let us play a game of billiards.\"\r\n\r\n\"First,\" said Binder, sadly, \"I must deliver my painful message to Count\r\nBartenstein.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! the page can be sent to dismiss him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there is no reason why we should keep the poor man waiting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Him, the poor man, say you? I remember the day when I waited in HIS\r\nanteroom, and as I am an honest man, I shall pay him with interest, Come\r\nalong, my dear future state referendarius.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE RED STOCKINGS.\r\n\r\nAt Kaunitz's dinner-table on that day revelry reigned triumphant. No\r\njest was too bold for the lips of the men; and if perchance upon the\r\ncheeks of their beautiful companions there rose the slightest flush of\r\nwomanly shame, the knights of the revel shouted applause, and pealed\r\nforth their praises in wildest dithyrambics. With glowing faces and eyes\r\nof flame they ate their highly-spiced viands, and drank their fiery\r\nwines, until all restraint was flung aside, and madness ruled the hour.\r\n\r\nThe lovely Ferlina, whom Kaunitz had placed next to himself, was\r\nbeautiful as Grecian Phryne; and Sacco, who was between her adorers,\r\nHarrach and Colloredo, was bold and bewitching as Lais.\r\n\r\nThe odor of flowers--the sound of distant music, every thing that could\r\nintoxicate the senses, was there. It was one of those orgies which\r\nKaunitz alone knew how to devise, and into which all the lesser\r\nlibertines of Vienna longed to be initiated; for once admitted there,\r\nthey were graduates in the school of vice.\r\n\r\nThe guests were excited beyond control, but not so the host. He who\r\ninvoked the demon that possessed the rest, sat perfectly collected. With\r\nthe coolness of a helmsman he steered the flower-laden bark of\r\nvoluptuousness toward the breakers, while he befooled its passengers\r\nwith visions of fatal beauty.\r\n\r\nThe feast was at an end, and as Kaunitz reviewed the faces of the\r\ncompany and saw that for the day their passions were weary from\r\nindulgence, he said to himself, with diabolical calmness: \"Now that they\r\nhave exhausted every other pleasure, we will sharpen the blunted edge of\r\ndesire with gambling! When the life of the heart is burnt to ashes, it\r\nwill still revive at the chink of gold.\"\r\n\r\n\"To the gaming-table, friends, to the gaming-table!\" cried he. And the\r\ndull eyes grew bright, while the guests followed him to the\r\ngreen-covered table, which stood at the farther end of the dining-room.\r\n\r\nKaunitz took from a casket a heap of gold, while La Ferlina gazed upon\r\nit with longing sighs. Harrach and Colloredo poured showers from their\r\npurses, and Sacco looked from one to the other with her most ineffable\r\nsmiles. Kaunitz saw it all, and as he threw the dice into the golden\r\ndice-box, he muttered, \"Miserable worms, ye think yourselves gods, and\r\nare the slaves of a little fiend, whose name is GOLD.\"\r\n\r\nAs he raised the dice-box, the door opened, and his first valet appeared\r\non the threshold.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your excellency, that I presume to enter the room. But there\r\nis a messenger from the empress, and she begs your excellency's\r\nimmediate attendance.\"\r\n\r\nWith an air of consummate indifference, Kaunitz replaced the dice on the\r\ntable. \"My carriage,\" was his reply to the valet; and to his guests,\r\nwith a graceful inclination, he said, \"Do not let this interrupt you.\r\nCount Harrach will be my banker. In this casket are ten thousand\r\nflorins--I go halves with the charming Ferlina.\"\r\n\r\nSignora Ferlina could not contain herself for joy, and in the exuberance\r\nof her gratitude, she disturbed some of the folds of Kaunitz's lace\r\nruff. Kaunitz was furious; but, without changing a muscle, he went on.\r\n\"Farewell, my lords--farewell, ladies! I must away to the post of duty.\"\r\n\r\nAnother bend of the head, and he disappeared. The valets and\r\nhair-dresser were already buzzing around his dressing-room with\r\ncourt-dress and red stocking, but Kaunitz waved them all away, and\r\ncalled Hippolyte to arrange a curl of his hair that was displaced.\r\n\r\nThe chief valet, who had been petrified with astonishment, now came to\r\nlife; and advanced, holding in his hand the rich court-dress.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon, your excellency; but my lord the count is about to have an\r\naudience with her imperial majesty?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" was the curt reply.\r\n\r\n\"Then your excellency must comply with the etiquette of the empress's\r\ncourt, which requires the full Spanish dress, dagger, and red\r\nstockings.\"\r\n\r\n\"MUST?\" said Kaunitz contemptuously. \"Fool! From this day, no one shall\r\nsay to Count Kaunitz, 'Must.' Bear that in mind. Hand me my muff.\"\r\n\r\n\"Muff, my lord?\" echoed the valet.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, fool, my hands are cold.\"\r\n\r\nThe valet looked out of the window, where flamed the radiance of a June\r\nsun, and with a deep sigh for the waywardness of his master, handed the\r\nmuff.\r\n\r\nKaunitz thrust in his hands, and slowly left the room, followed by the\r\ndog, the valets, and the hair-dresser. Every time his excellency went\r\nout, this procession came as far as the carriage door, to see that\r\nnothing remained imperfect in this toilet. With the muff held close to\r\nhis mouth, for fear a breath of air should enter it, Kaunitz passed\r\nthrough the lofty corridors of his house to his state-carriage. The dog\r\nwished to get in, but he waved her gently back, saying:\r\n\r\n\"No, Phaedra, not to-day. I dare not take you there.\"\r\n\r\nThe carriage rolled off, and the servants looked after in dumb\r\nconsternation. At last the first valet, with a malicious smile, said to\r\nthe others:\r\n\r\n\"I stick to my opinion--he is crazy. Who but a madman would hope to be\r\nadmitted to her imperial majesty's presence without red stockings and a\r\ndagger?\"\r\n\r\nHippolyte shook his head. \"No, no, he is no madman; he is only a\r\nsingular genius, who knows the world, and snaps his fingers at it.\"\r\n\r\nThe valet was not far from right. The simple dress, white stockings, and\r\nthe absence of the dagger, raised a commotion in the palace.\r\n\r\nThe page in the entrance-hall was afraid to announce the count, and he\r\nrushed into the anteroom to consult the marshal of the imperial\r\nhousehold. The latter, with his sweetest smile, hastened to meet the\r\nindignant count.\r\n\r\n\"Have the goodness, my lord,\" said Kaunitz imperiously, \"not to detain\r\nme any longer. The empress has called me to her presence; say that I am\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, count,\" cried the horror-stricken marshal, \"you cannot seriously\r\nmean to present yourself in such a garb. Doubtless you have forgotten,\r\nfrom absence of mind, to array yourself as court etiquette exacts of her\r\nmajesty's servants. If you will do me the favor to accompany me to my\r\nown apartments, I will with great pleasure supply the red stockings and\r\ndagger.\"\r\n\r\nCount Kaunitz shrugged his shoulders disdainfully. \"Her majesty sent for\r\nME, not for my red stockings; therefore, please to announce me.\"\r\n\r\nThe marshal retreated, in his surprise, several steps. \"Never,\" cried he\r\nindignantly, \"never would I presume to do so unheard-of a thing! Such a\r\ntransgression of her majesty's orders is inadmissible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" replied Kaunitz coolly, \"I shall then have the pleasure of\r\nannouncing myself.\"\r\n\r\nHe passed by the marshal and dismayed page, and was advancing to the\r\ndoor that led to the imperial apartments.\r\n\r\n\"Hold! hold!\" groaned the marshal, whose consternation was now at its\r\nheight. \"That were too presuming! Since her majesty has commanded your\r\nattendance, I will do my duty. I leave it to yourself, my lord, to\r\nexcuse your own boldness, if you can carry it so far as to attempt a\r\njustification of your conduct.\"\r\n\r\nHe bowed, and passed into the next room; then into the cabinet of the\r\nempress, whence he returned with word for Count Kaunitz to enter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nNEW AUSTRIA.\r\n\r\nThe empress received the count with a most gracious smile. \"You are\r\nlate,\" she said, reaching out her hand for him to kiss.\r\n\r\n\"I came very near not reaching your majesty's presence at all, for those\r\ntwo wiseacres in the anteroom refused me entrance, because I had neither\r\nred stockings nor a dagger.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress then perceived the omission, and she frowned. \"Why did you\r\npresent yourself here, without them?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"Because, your majesty, I detest red stockings; and I really cannot see\r\nwhy I should be compelled to wear any thing that is so distasteful to\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa was so surprised, that she scarcely knew what reply to\r\nmake to the argument; so Kaunitz continued:\r\n\r\n\"And as for the dagger, that is no emblem of my craft. I am not a\r\nsoldier, but a statesman; my implement is the crowquill.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the tongue,\" replied the empress, \"for you certainly know how to\r\nuse it. Let us dismiss the dagger and red stockings, then, and speak of\r\nyour pen and your tongue, for I need them both. I have well weighed the\r\nmatters under consideration, and have taken counsel of Heaven and of my\r\nown conscience. I hope that my decision will be for the best.\"\r\n\r\nCount Kaunitz, courtier though he was, could not repress a slight\r\nshiver, nor could he master the paleness that overspread his anxious\r\nface.\r\n\r\nThe empress went on: \"I have irrevocably decided. I abide by what I said\r\nin council. A new day shall dawn upon Austria--God grant that it prove a\r\nhappy one! Away, then, with the old alliance! we offer our hand to\r\nFrance, and you shall conduct the negotiations. I appoint you lord high\r\nchancellor in the place of Count Uhlefeld. And you owe me some thanks,\r\nfor I assure you that, to carry out my opposition to my ministers, I\r\nhave striven with countless difficulties.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank your majesty for resolving upon an alliance with France,\" said\r\nKaunitz, earnestly; \"for I do believe that it will conduce to Austria's\r\nwelfare.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you not thank me for making you prime minister, or is the\r\nappointment unwelcome?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be the happiest of mortals if I can accept; but that question\r\nis for your majesty to decide.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress colored, and looked displeased, while Kaunitz, \"himself\r\nagain,\" stood composed and collected before her.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said she, quickly, \"you wish me to beg you to accept the highest\r\noffice in Austria! Do you think it a favor you do me to become my prime\r\nminister, Kaunitz?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty,\" replied Kaunitz in his soft, calm tones, \"I think not of\r\nmyself, but of Austria that I love, and of you, my honored empress, whom\r\nI would die to serve. But I must know whether it will be allowed me to\r\nserve my empress and my fatherland as I can and will serve them both.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean? Explain yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I am to labor in your behalf, my empress, I must have free hands,\r\nwithout colleagues by my side, to discuss my plans and plot against\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said the empress, smiling, \"I understand. You mean Bartenstein and\r\nCounts Harrach and Colloredo. True, they are your rivals.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, your majesty, not my rivals, I hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, your enemies, if you like that better,\" said the empress.\r\n\"I shall not chain you together, then. I will find other places\r\nwherewith to compensate them for their past services, and you may find\r\nother colleagues.\"\r\n\r\n\"I desire no colleagues, your majesty,\" replied Kaunitz, \"I wish to be\r\nprime and only minister. Then together we will weld Austria's many\r\ndependencies into one great empire, and unite its governments under one\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yours, count?\" asked Maria Theresa, in a slight tone of irony.\r\n\r\n\"Yours, my sovereign. Whatever you may think, up to this moment you have\r\nnot reigned supreme in Austria. By your side have Bartenstein and\r\nUhlefeld reigned like lesser emperors. Is not Lombardy governed by its\r\nown princes, and does not the Viceroy of Hungary make laws and edicts,\r\nwhich are brought to you for signature?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am truly hemmed in on every side. But I see no remedy for the\r\nevil--I cannot govern everywhere. Hungary and Lombardy have their own\r\nconstitutions, and must have their own separate governments.\"\r\n\r\n\"So long as that state of things lasts, neither Hungary nor Lombardy\r\nwill be portions of the Austrian empire,\" said Kaunitz.\r\n\r\n\"There is no remedy, Kaunitz,\" returned Maria Theresa; \"I have thought\r\nthese difficulties over and over. My arm is too short to reach to the\r\nfarthest ends of my realms, and I must be content to delegate some of my\r\npower. One hand cannot navigate the ship of state.\"\r\n\r\n\"But one head can steer it, your majesty, and one head can direct the\r\nhands that work it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And will the count be one of my hands?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed, your majesty. But the fingers must be subject to this\r\nhand, and the hand will then carry out, in all security, the plans of\r\nits august head, the empress.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean to say that you wish to be alone as my minister?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I am truly to serve your majesty, it must be so. Let not the\r\nsovereignty of Austria be frittered away in multitudinous rivulets;\r\ngather it all in one full, fertilizing stream. One head and one hand\r\nover Austria's destiny, and then will she grow independent and\r\nall-powerful.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, man,\" cried the empress, \"you cannot sustain the burden you\r\ncovet!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will have ample help, your majesty. I will seek ready hands and\r\nwilling hearts that believe in me, and will do my behests. These must\r\nnot be my coadjutors, but my subalterns, who think through me, and work\r\nfor me. If your majesty will grant me this privilege, then I can serve\r\nAustria. I know that I am asking for high prerogatives; but for\r\nAustria's sake, Maria Theresa will dare every thing; and together we\r\nwill accomplish the consolidation of her disjecta membra into one great\r\nempire. The policy which conducts our financial affairs must emanate\r\nfrom yourself, and our foreign policy must be bold and frank, that\r\nfriends and foes may both know what we mean. We must coffin and bury old\r\nAustria with the dead that sleep on the battle-grounds of lost Silesia;\r\nand from her ashes we must build a new empire, of which Hungary and\r\nLombardy shall be integral parts. Hand in hand with France, we will be\r\nthe lawgivers of all Europe; and when, thanks to our thrift and the rich\r\ntribute of our provinces, we pay our national debt, then we may laugh at\r\nEnglish subsidies and Dutch commerce. And lastly, we will cast our eyes\r\nonce more upon Silesia, and methinks if France and Austria together\r\nshould demand restitution of King Frederick, he will scarcely be so rash\r\nas to say nay. The ministers of Louis XV., who were adverse to our\r\nalliance, are about to retire, and the Duke de Choiseul, our firm friend\r\nand the favorite of Mme. de Pompadour, will replace Richelieu. Choiseul\r\nseeks our friendship, and the day of our triumph is dawning. Such, your\r\nmajesty, are my dreams for Austria; it rests with you to make them\r\nrealities!\"\r\n\r\nThe empress had listened with increasing interest to every word that\r\nKaunitz had spoken. She had risen from her seat and was pacing the room\r\nin a state of high excitement. As he ceased she stopped in front of him,\r\nand her large, sparkling orbs of blue glowed with an expression of\r\nhappiness and hope.\r\n\r\n\"I believe that you are the man for Austria,\" said she. \"I believe that\r\ntogether we can carry out our plans and projects. God grant that they be\r\nrighteous and just in His sight! You have read my heart, and you know\r\nthat I can never reconcile myself to the loss of Silesia. You know that\r\nbetween me and Frederick no harmony can ever exist; no treaty can ever\r\nbe signed to which he is a party. [Footnote: Maria Theresa's own words.]\r\nI will take the hand of France, not so much for love of herself as for\r\nher enmity to Prussia. Will you work with me to make war on Frederick if\r\nI appoint you sole minister, Kaunitz? For I tell you that I burn to\r\nrenew my strife with the King of Prussia, and I would rather give him\r\nbattle to-day than to-morrow.\" [Footnote: Maria Theresa's own words.\r\nCoxe.]\r\n\r\n\"I comprehend your majesty's feelings, and fully share them. As soon as\r\nFrance and ourselves understand one another, we will make a league\r\nagainst Frederick, and may easily make him strike the first blow; for\r\neven now he is longing to appropriate another Silesia.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I am longing to cross swords with him for the one he has stolen. I\r\ncannot bear to think of going to my fathers with a diminished\r\ninheritance; I cannot brook the thought that my woman's hands have not\r\nbeen strong enough to preserve my rights; for I feel that if I have the\r\nheart of a woman, I have the head of a man. To see Austria great and\r\npowerful, to see her men noble and her women virtuous--that is my dream,\r\nmy hope, my aim in life. You are the one to perfect what I have\r\nconceived, Kaunitz; will you give me your hand to this great work?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, your majesty, so help me God!\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you have Austria's good alone in view, in all that you counsel as\r\nmy minister?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, so help me God!\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you take counsel with me how we may justly and righteously govern\r\nAustria, without prejudice, without self-love, without thought of\r\nworldly fame, not from love or fear of man, but for the sake of God from\r\nwhose hands we hold our empire?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, so help me God!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Maria Theresa, after a pause, \"you are my sole minister,\r\nand I empower you to preside over the affairs of state, in the manner\r\nyou may judge fittest for the welfare of the Austrian people.\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz was as self-possessed a worldling as ever sought to hide his\r\nemotions; but he could not suppress an exclamation of rapture, nor an\r\nexpression of triumph, which lit up his face as nothing had ever\r\nillumined it before.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty,\" said he, when he found words, \"I accept the trust, and\r\nas there is a God above to judge me, I will hold it faithfully. My days\r\nand nights, my youth and age, with their thoughts, their will, their\r\nevery faculty, shall be laid upon the shrine of Austria's greatness; and\r\nif for one moment I ever sacrifice your majesty to any interest of mine,\r\nmay I die a death of torture and disgrace!\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe you; your countenance reflects your heart, and Almighty God\r\nhas heard your words. One thing remember--that Maria Theresa suffers no\r\nminister to dictate to her. She is the reigning sovereign of her people,\r\nand will not suffer a finger to be laid upon her imperial rights. Were\r\nhe a thousand times prime minister, the man that presumed too far with\r\nme I would hurl from his eminence to the lowest depths of disgrace. And\r\nnow that we understand one another, we will clasp hands like men, who\r\nare pledged before God to do their duty.\"\r\n\r\nShe extended her hand to Kaunitz, who grasped it in his own. \"I swear,\"\r\nsaid he, solemnly, \"to do my duty; and never can I forget this hour. I\r\nswear to my SOVEREIGN, Maria Theresa, loyalty unto death; and before my\r\nEMPRESS I bow my knee, and so do homage to the greatest woman of her\r\nage.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress smiled, while Kaunitz knelt and kissed her fair, jewelled\r\nhand. \"May God grant that you speak truth, Kaunitz, and may my posterity\r\nnot have to blush for me! 'Every thing for Austria,' shall be your motto\r\nand mine; and this flaming device shall light us on our way through\r\nlife. Now go, lord high chancellor, and see that the world finds a\r\nphoenix in the ashes of the old regime which to-day we have consigned to\r\nthe dust!\" [Footnote: From this time, Kaunitz was the sole minister of\r\nthe empress; and he kept his promise to Binder, who became state\r\nreferendarius, in the place of the once-powerful Bartenstein.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISABELLA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG SOLDIER.\r\n\r\nKaunitz's prophecy had been fulfilled. No sooner was it known that\r\nAustria and France were allies, than Frederick of Prussia, with all\r\nhaste, made treaties with England. These opposite alliances were the\r\nsignal for war. For seven years this war held its blood-stained lash\r\nover Austria, and every nation in Europe suffered more or less from its\r\neffects. Maria Theresa began it with sharp words, to which Frederick had\r\nresponded with his sharper sword.\r\n\r\nThe king, through his ambassador, asked the meaning of her extensive\r\nmilitary preparations throughout Austria, to which the empress, nettled\r\nby the arrogance of the demand, had replied that she believed she had a\r\nright to mass troops for the protection of herself and her allies,\r\nwithout rendering account of her acts to foreign kings. Upon the receipt\r\nof this reply, Frederick marched his troops into Saxony, and so began\r\nthe \"Seven Years' War,\" a war that was prosecuted on both sides with\r\nbitter vindictiveness.\r\n\r\nThroughout Austria the wildest enthusiasm prevailed. Rich and poor,\r\nyoung and old, all rushed to the fight. The warlike spirit that pervaded\r\nher people made its way to the heart of the empress's eldest son. The\r\nArchduke Joseph had for some time been entreating his mother to allow\r\nhim to join the army; and, at last, though much against her will, she\r\nhad yielded to his urgent desire. The day on which news of a victory,\r\nnear Kunnersdorf, over Frederick, reached the palace, the empress had\r\ngiven her consent, and her son was to be allowed to go in search of\r\nlaurel-wreaths wherewith to deck his imperial brow.\r\n\r\nThis permission to enter the army was the first great joy of Joseph's\r\nlife. His heart, at last freed from its weight of conventional duties,\r\nand forced submission to the requirements of court etiquette, soared\r\nhigh into regions of exultant happiness. His countenance, once so cold\r\nand impassible, was now full of joyous changes; his eyes, once so dull\r\nand weary, glowed with the fire of awakened enthusiasm, and they looked\r\nso brilliant a blue, that it seemed as if some little ray from heaven\r\nhad found its way into their clear, bright depths. The poor boy was an\r\naltered creature. He was frolicsome with his friends; and as for those\r\nwhom he considered his enemies, he cared nothing for their likes or\r\ndislikes. He had nothing to lose or gain from them; he was to leave the\r\ncourt, leave Vienna, leave every troublesome remembrance behind, and go,\r\nfar from all tormentors, to the army.\r\n\r\nThe preparations were at an end; the archduke bad taken formal leave of\r\nhis mother's court; this evening he was to spend in the imperial family\r\ncircle; and early on the next morning his journey would begin. He had\r\njust written a last note of farewell to a friend. Alone in his room, he\r\nstood before a mirror, contemplating with a smile his own image. He was\r\nnot looking at his handsome face, though happiness was lending it\r\nexquisite beauty; the object of his rapturous admiration was the white\r\nuniform, which, for the first time, he wore in place of his court-dress.\r\nHe was no longer the descendant of Charles the Fifth, no longer the son\r\nof the empress, he was a soldier--a free, self-sustaining man, whose\r\ndestiny lay in his own hands, and whose future deeds would prove him\r\nworthy to be the son of his great ancestor.\r\n\r\nAs, almost intoxicated with excess of joy, he stood before the glass,\r\nthe door opened gently, and a youth of about his own age entered the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your highness,\" said the youth, bowing, \"if I enter without\r\npermission. Doubtless your highness did not hear me knock, and I found\r\nno one in your anteroom to announce me.\"\r\n\r\nThe prince turned around, and reached out his hand, saying, with a\r\nlaugh: \"No, no, you found nobody. I have discharged old Dame Etiquette\r\nfrom my service, and you see before you not his imperial highness, the\r\nArchduke Joseph, crown prince of Austria, but a young soldier, brimful\r\nof happiness, master of nothing but his own sword, with which he means\r\nto carve out his fortunes on the battlefield. Oh, Dominick! I have\r\ndropped the rosary, and taken up the sabre; and I mean to twist such a\r\nforest of laurels about my head, that it will be impossible for me ever\r\nto wear a night-cap again, were it even sent me as a present from the\r\npope himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not talk so loud, your highness; you will frighten the proprieties\r\nout of their wits.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph laughed. \"Dominick Kaunitz\" said he, \"you are the son of your\r\nrespected father, no doubt of it; for you behave prettily before the\r\nbare walls themselves. But fear not, son of the mighty minister, MY walls\r\nare dumb, and nobody is near to tell tales. We are alone, for I have\r\ndismissed all my attendants; and here I may give loud vent to my\r\nhallelujahs, which I now proceed to do by singing you a song which I\r\nlearned not long ago from an invalid soldier in the street.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the prince began, in a sonorous bass voice, to sing:\r\n\r\n\"Oh! the young cannon is my bride! Her orange-wreath is twined with bay,\r\nAnd on the blood-red battle-field We'll celebrate our wedding-day.\r\nTrara! trara! No priest is there To bless the rites, No--\"\r\n\r\nHere young Kaunitz, all etiquette despising, put his hands before the\r\nmouth of the prince; and, while the latter strove, in spite of him, to\r\ngo on with his song, he said, in low but anxious tones:\r\n\r\n\"For Heavens sake, your highness, listen to me. You plunge yourself\r\nwantonly into danger. Do you suppose that your powerful voice does not\r\nresound through the corridors of the palace?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if it is heard, Dominick, what of it? I bid farewell to my\r\nenemies, and this is my 'Hosanna.' You ought to be ashamed of yourself\r\nto stop me. My tormentors, you think, have heard the beginning of my\r\nsong; well, the devil take it, but they shall have the end!\"\r\n\r\nOnce more the archduke began to sing; but Dominick caught his arm. \"Do\r\nyou wish,\" said he, \"to have the empress revoke her permission?\"\r\n\r\nThe archduke laughed, \"Why, Dominick, you are crazed with grief for my\r\nloss, I do believe; the empress revoke her imperial word, now, when all\r\nmy preparations are made, and I go to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Empresses do revoke their words, and preparations are often made, to be\r\nfollowed by--nothing,\" replied Dominick.\r\n\r\nThe prince looked in consternation at his young friend. \"Are you in\r\nearnest, dear Dominick?\" asked he. \"Do you indeed think it possible that\r\nI could be hindered from going to the army, on the very eve of my\r\ndeparture?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do, your highness.\"\r\n\r\nThe archduke grew pale, and in a tremulous voice said, \"Upon what do you\r\nfound your supposition, my friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my dear lord,\" replied Dominick, \"it is no supposition, I fear it\r\nis a fact; and I fear, too, that it is your own fault if this\r\ndisappointment awaits you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Heaven!\" exclaimed the prince, in tones of anguish, \"what can I\r\nhave done to deserve such fearful chastisement?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have displeased the empress by neglect of your religious duties.\r\nFor more than two weeks you have not entered a place of worship; and,\r\nyesterday, when the Countess Fuchs remonstrated with your highness, you\r\nreplied with an unseemly jest. You said, 'Dearest countess, I hope to\r\nprove to you that, although I neglect my mass, I can be pious on the\r\nbattle-field. There, on the altar of my country, I mean to sacrifice\r\ncountless enemies, and that will be an offering quite as pleasing in the\r\nsight of God.' Were those not your words, prince?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, they were--but I meant no impiety. My heart was so full of\r\njoy that it effervesced in wild words; but surely my mother cannot mean,\r\nfor such a harmless jest, to dash my every hope to the earth!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, your highness, this is only one offence out of many of which you\r\nare accused. I have no time to repeat them now, for my errand here is\r\nimportant and pressing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where learned you all this?\" asked the poor archduke.\r\n\r\n\"Bend down your ear, and I will tell you. My father told me every word\r\nof it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The lord high chancellor? Impossible!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it would seem impossible that he should repeat any thing, and\r\ntherefore you may know how seriously the matter affects your highness\r\nwhen I tell you that he sent me to warn you.\"\r\n\r\nA quick, loud knock at the door interrupted him, and before the archduke\r\ncould say \"Come in,\" the Emperor Francis was in the room. His face\r\nlooked careworn, and he cast a glance of tender compassion upon his son.\r\n\r\n\"My child,\" said he, \"I come to speak to you in private a thing I cannot\r\ncompass in my own apartments.\"\r\n\r\nDominick bowed to take leave, but the emperor withheld him. \"Stay,\" said\r\nhe, \"for you may serve us, Dominick. I know you to be Joseph's best\r\nfriend, and you will not betray him. But I have no time for words. Tell\r\nme quickly, Joseph, is there any secret outlet to these apartments? Do\r\nyou know of any hidden stairway by which you could escape from the\r\npalace?\"\r\n\r\n\"I, father! I have secret doors in my apartments? Is this some new\r\ndevice of my enemies to injure me in the eyes of the empress?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, hush, Joseph!--How like he is in temperament to his\r\nmother!--Answer me at once; there is no question of enemies, but of\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you have me do with secret doors and stairways?\" asked\r\nJoseph.\r\n\r\nThe emperor came close to his son, and, in low, cautious tones,\r\nwhispered, \"I would have you, this very hour, leave the palace\r\nprivately, mount your horse, and speed away from Vienna.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fly, my dear father?\" cried Joseph. \"Has it come to this, that the son\r\nmust fly from the face of his own mother? Am I a criminal, who must not\r\nbe told of what crime I am accused? No, your majesty; if death, or\r\nimprisonment for life, were here to threaten me, I would not fly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor would I counsel flight, my son, were you accused of wrong; but this\r\nis not a question of crime, of poisoned beaker, or of castle dungeon--it\r\nis simply this: Do you wish to join the army, or are you ready to give\r\nup your commission and stay at home?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my dear father,\" cried Joseph, \"you well know that I have but one\r\ndesire on earth--and that is, to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, hear me. It has been represented to the empress that your lust\r\nfor war has made you so reckless, so bloodthirsty, and so impious, that\r\ncamp-life will prove your ruin. In her excess of maternal love, she has\r\ntaken the alarm, and has resolved to shield you from danger by\r\nwithdrawing her consent to your departure.\"\r\n\r\nThe archduke's eyes filled with tears. The emperor laid his hand\r\nsympathizingly upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Do not despair, dear child,\" said he, tenderly; \"perhaps all is not\r\nlost, and I may be able to assist you. I can comprehend the nature of\r\nyour sorrow, for I have suffered the same bitter disappointment. If,\r\ninstead of leading a useless life, a mere appanage of the empress, I had\r\nbeen permitted to follow the dictates of my heart, and command her\r\narmies, I might have--but why speak of my waning career? You are young,\r\nand I do not wish to see your life darkened by such early\r\ndisappointment. Therefore, listen to me. You know nothing of the change\r\nin your prospects--you have not as yet, received no orders to remain.\r\nWrite to your mother, that, preferring to go without the grief of taking\r\nleave, you have presumed to start tonight without her knowledge, hoping\r\nsoon to embrace her again, and lay your first-earned laurels at her\r\nfeet.\"\r\n\r\nThe archduke hastened to obey his father, and sat down to write. The\r\nemperor, meanwhile, signed to young Kaunitz, who had kept himself\r\nrespectfully aloof.\r\n\r\n\"Have you a courser,\" asked he, \"to sell to Joseph, and two good\r\nservants that can accompany him until his own attendants can be sent\r\nafter him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I came hither, your majesty, prepared to make the same proposition,\r\nwith the fleetest horse in my father's stables, and two trusty servants,\r\nwell mounted, all of which await his highness at the postern gate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your father's best horse? Then he knows of this affair?\" \"It was he who\r\nsent me to the archduke's assistance. He told me, in case of necessity,\r\nto propose flight, and to be ready for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The letter is ready,\" said the archduke, coming forward.\r\n\r\n\"I myself will hand it to the empress,\" said his father, taking it, \"and\r\nI will tell her that I counselled you to go as you did.\"\r\n\r\n\"But dear father, the empress will be angry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my son,\" said the emperor, with a peculiar smile, \"I have\r\nsurvived so many little passing storms, that I shall doubtless survive\r\nthis one. The empress has the best and noblest heart in the world, and\r\nits sunshine is always brightest after a storm. Go, then, my child, I\r\nwill answer for your sin and mine. The empress has said nothing to me of\r\nher change of purpose; she looks upon it as a state affair, and with her\r\nstate affairs I am never made acquainted. Since accident has betrayed it\r\nto me, I have a right to use my knowledge in your behalf, and I\r\nundertake to appease your mother. Here is a purse with two thousand\r\nlouis d'ors; it is enough for a few days of incognito. Throw your\r\nmilitary cloak about you, and away!\"\r\n\r\nYoung Kaunitz laid the cloak upon the shoulders of the archduke, whose\r\neyes beamed forth the gratitude that filled his heart.\r\n\r\n\"Oh my father and my sovereign,\" said he in a voice that trembled with\r\nemotion, \"my whole life will not be long enough to thank you for what\r\nyon are doing for me in this critical hour. Till now I have loved you\r\nindeed as my father, but henceforth I must look upon you as my\r\nbenefactor also, as my dearest and best friend. My heart and my soul are\r\nyours, dear father; may I be worthy of your love and of the sacrifice\r\nyou are making for me to-day!\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor folded his son to his heart, and kissed his fair forehead.\r\n\"Farewell, dear boy,\" whispered he; \"return to me a victor and a hero.\r\nMay you earn for your father on the battle-field the laurels which he\r\nhas seen in dreams! God bless you!\"\r\n\r\nThey then left the room, Count Kaunitz leading the way, to see if the\r\npassage was clear.\r\n\r\n\"I will go with you as far as the staircase,\" continued the emperor,\r\n\"and then--\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment Dominick, who had gone forward into the corridor, rushed\r\nback into the room pale and trembling, \"It is too late!\" exclaimed he in\r\na stifled voice; \"there comes a messenger from the empress!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE EMPRESS AND HER SON.\r\n\r\nThe young count was not mistaken. It was indeed a message from the\r\nempress. It was the marshal of the household, followed by four pages who\r\ncame to command the presence of the archduke, to whom her majesty wished\r\nto impart something of importance.\r\n\r\nA deadly paleness overspread the face of the young prince, and his whole\r\nframe shivered. The emperor felt the shudder, and drew his son's arm\r\ncloser to his heart. \"Courage, my son, courage!\" whispered he: then\r\nturning toward the imperial embassy, he said aloud, \"Announce to her\r\nmajesty that I will accompany the arch-duke in a few moments.\" And as\r\nthe marshal stood irresolute and confused, the emperor, smiling, said:\r\n\"Oh, I see that you have been ordered to accompany the prince\r\nyourselves. Come, then, my son, we will e'en go along with the\r\nmessengers.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa was pacing the floor of her apartment in great excitement.\r\nHer large, flashing eyes now and then turned toward the door; and\r\nwhenever she fancied that footsteps approached, she stopped, and seemed\r\nalmost to gasp with anxiety.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she turned toward Father Porhaminer, who, with the Countess\r\nFuchs, stood by the side of the sofa from which she had risen. \"Father,\"\r\nsaid she, in a tremulous voice, \"I cannot tell why it is that, as I\r\nawait my son's presence here, my heart is overwhelmed with anguish. I\r\nfeel as if I were about to do him an injustice, and for all the kingdoms\r\nof the world I would not do him wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" replied the father, \"your majesty is about to rescue that beloved\r\nson from destruction; but as your majesty is a loving mother, it\r\nafflicts you to disappoint your child. Still, our Lord has commanded if\r\nthe right eye offend, to pluck it out; and so is it your majesty's duty\r\nto pluck from your son's heart the evil growing there, even were his\r\nheart's blood to follow. The wounds you may inflict upon your dear\r\nchild, for God's sake, will soon be healed by His Almighty hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was so happy to become a soldier!\" murmured the empress, who had\r\nresumed her agitated walk; \"his eyes were so bright, and his bearing was\r\nso full of joy and pride! My boy is so handsome, so like his dear\r\nfather, that my heart throbs when I see him, as it did in the days when\r\nwe were young lovers! A laurel-wreath would well become his fair brow,\r\nand I--how proudly I should have welcomed my young hero to my heart once\r\nmore! Dear, dear boy, must I then wake you so rudely from your first\r\ndream of ambition?--I must. He would come to evil in the lawless life of\r\nthe camp; God forgive him, but he is as mad for the fight as Don John of\r\nAustria! I should never see him again; he would seek death in his first\r\nbattle.. Oh, I could not survive it; my heart would break if I should\r\nhave to give up my first-born! Four of my children lie in the vaults of\r\nSt. Stephen's--I cannot part with my Joseph! Countess,\" she said,\r\nturning suddenly to her lady of Honor, \"is it not true that Joseph told\r\nyou he thought that the altar of the battle-field and the sacrifice, of\r\nhis enemies was--\"\r\n\r\n\"His majesty the emperor and his imperial highness, the Archduke\r\nJoseph!\" said the marshal of the household; and the door was flung open\r\nfor their entrance.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa advanced, and bowed slightly to the emperor. \"Your\r\nmajesty's visit at this unusual hour surprises me,\" said she with\r\nemphasis.\r\n\r\n\"I am aware,\" replied the emperor graciously, \"that I was not expected;\r\nbut as this is the last day of our son's residence under the parental\r\nroof, I am sure that my wife will see nothing strange in my visit. I was\r\nwith the archduke when your majesty's message reached him, and knowing\r\nthat you could have no secrets with the son which the father might not\r\nhear, I followed the impulse of my affection, and came with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what signifies this singular and unseemly dress in which my son\r\npresents himself before his sovereign?\" asked Maria Theresa, angrily\r\nsurveying the uniform which, nevertheless, she acknowledged in her heart\r\nwas beyond expression becoming to him.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your majesty,\" replied the son, \"I had tried on one uniform,\r\nand if I was to obey your summons at once, there was no time for a\r\nchange in my dress.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, indeed,\" said the emperor, \"I think the dress becoming. Our boy\r\nwill make a fine-looking soldier.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress being precisely of that opinion herself, was so much the\r\nmore vexed at her husband for giving it expression. She bit her lip, and\r\nher brow contracted, as was usual with her when she was growing angry.\r\n\r\n\"You held it then as a fact, my son, that you were a soldier?\" said she,\r\ncatching her breath with anxiety.\r\n\r\nJoseph raised his fine eyes, with an imploring expression, to the face\r\nof his mother. \"Your majesty had promised me that I should be a\r\nsoldier,\" replied he firmly, \"and I have never yet known my mother to\r\nbreak her imperial word to the least of her subjects.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear him!\" cried the empress, with a laugh of derision, \"he almost\r\nthreatens me! This young sir will try to make it a point of honor with\r\nme to keep my word.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your majesty,\" replied Joseph calmly, \"I have never allowed\r\nmyself to doubt your imperial word for one moment of my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, your highness has my imperial permission to doubt it now,\"\r\ncried the empress, severely humiliated by the implied rebuke; \"I allow\r\nyou to doubt whether I will ever hold promises that have been rashly and\r\ninjudiciously made.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, your majesty,\" cried the emperor, \"surely you will not retract\r\nyour word in the face of the whole world, that knows of Joseph's\r\nappointment!\"\r\n\r\n\"What to me is the opinion of the world?\" returned the haughty empress.\r\n\"To God and my conscience alone I am responsible for my acts, and to\r\nthem I will answer it that I take back my promise, and declare that\r\nJoseph shall not go into the army!\"\r\n\r\nJoseph uttered a cry of anguish. \"Mother! mother!\" sobbed the unhappy\r\nboy, \"it cannot be!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why can it not be?\" said the empress, haughtily.\r\n\r\n\"Because it would be a cruel and heartless deed,\" cried the archduke,\r\nlosing all control over himself, \"so to make sport of my holiest and\r\npurest hopes in life; and because I never, never can believe that my own\r\nmother would seek to break my heart.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress was about to return a scathing reply, when the emperor laid\r\nhis gentle hand upon her shoulder, and the words died upon her lips.\r\n\r\n\"I beseech of you, my wife,\" said he, \"to remember that we are not\r\nalone. Joseph is no child; and it ill becomes any but his parents to\r\nwitness his humiliation. Have the goodness, then, to dismiss your\r\nattendants, and let us deal with our son alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why shall I dismiss them?\" cried the empress, \"they are my trusty\r\nconfidants; and they have a right to hear all that the future Emperor of\r\nAustria presumes to say to his mother!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me,\" replied the emperor, \"I differ with you, and desire that\r\nthey should not hear our family discussions. In these things I too have\r\nmy right; and if your majesty does not command them to leave the room, I\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa looked at the countenance of her husband, which was firm\r\nand resolved in its expression. In her confusion she could find no\r\nretort. The emperor waited awhile, and seeing that she did not speak, he\r\nturned toward the two followers, who stood, without moving, at their\r\nposts.\r\n\r\n\"I request the Countess Fuchs and Father Porhammer to leave the room,\"\r\nsaid he, with dignity. \"Family concerns are discussed in private.\"\r\n\r\nThe pair did not go. Father Porhammer interrogated the face of the\r\nempress; and the countess, indignant that her curiosity was to be\r\nfrustrated, looked defiant.\r\n\r\nThis bold disregard of her husband's command was irritating to the\r\nfeelings of the empress. She thought that his orders should have\r\noutweighed her mere remonstrance, and she now felt it her duty to\r\nsignify as much.\r\n\r\n\"Countess Fuchs,\" said she, \"doubtless the emperor has not spoken loud\r\nenough for you to hear the command he has just given you. You have not\r\nunderstood his words, and I will take the trouble to repeat them. The\r\nemperor said, 'I request the Countess Fuchs and Father Porhammer to\r\nleave the room. Our family concerns we will discuss in private.'\"\r\n\r\nThe lady of honor colored, and, with deep inclinations, Father Porhammer\r\nand herself left the room.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa looked after them until the door was shut, then she\r\nsmilingly reached her hand to the emperor, who thanked her with a\r\npressure and a look of deepest affection. The archduke had retired to\r\nthe embrasure of a window, perhaps to seek composure, perhaps to hide\r\nhis tears.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Maria Theresa, sternly, while her fiery eyes sought the\r\nfigure of her son, \"now we are alone, and Joseph is at liberty to speak.\r\nI beg him to remember, that in the person of his mother, he also sees\r\nhis sovereign, and that the empress will resent every word of disloyalty\r\nspoken to the parent. And I hold it to be highly disloyal for my son to\r\naccuse me of making sport of his hopes. I have not come to my latest\r\ndetermination from cruelty or caprice; I have made it in the strength of\r\nmy maternal love to shield my child from sin, and in the rectitude of my\r\nimperial responsibility to my people, who have a right to claim from me\r\nthat I bestow upon them a monarch who is worthy to reign over Austria.\r\nTherefore, my son, as empress and mother, I say that you shall remain.\r\nThat is now my unalterable will. If this decision grieves you, be humble\r\nand submissive; and remember that it is your duty, as son and subject,\r\nto obey without demurring. Then shall we be good friends, and greet one\r\nanother heartily, as though you had at this moment returned from the\r\nvictorious battle-field. There is my hand. Be welcome, my dear and\r\nmuch-beloved child.\"\r\n\r\nThe heart of the empress had gradually softened, and as she smiled and\r\nextended her hand, her beautiful eyes were filled to overflowing with\r\ntears. But Joseph, deathly pale, crossed his arms, and returned her\r\nglances of love with a haughty, defiant look, that almost approached to\r\ndislike.\r\n\r\n\"My son,\" said the emperor, \"do you not see your dear mother's hand\r\nextended to meet yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see it, I see it,\" cried Joseph, passionately, \"but I cannot take\r\nit--I cannot play my part in this mockery of a return. No, mother, no, I\r\ncannot kiss the hand that has so cruelly dashed my hopes to earth. And\r\nyou wish to carry your tyranny so far as to exact that I receive it with\r\na smile? Oh, mother, my heart is breaking! Have pity on me, and take\r\nback those cruel words; let me go, let me go. Do not make me a byword\r\nfor the world, that hereafter will refuse me its respect. Let me go, if\r\nbut for a few weeks, and on the day that you command my return, I will\r\ncome home. Oh, my heart was too small to hold the love I bore you for\r\nyour consent to my departure. It seemed to me that I had lust begun to\r\nlive; the world was full of beauty, and I forgot all the trials of my\r\nchildhood. For one week I have been young, dear mother; hurl me not back\r\nagain into that dark dungeon of solitude where so much of my short life\r\nhas been spent. Do not condemn me to live as I have hitherto lived; give\r\nme freedom, give me my manhood's rights!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no! a thousand times no!\" cried the exasperated empress; \"I see now\r\nthat I am right to keep such an unfeeling and ungrateful son at home. He\r\ntalks of his sufferings forsooth! What has he ever suffered at my\r\nhands?\"\r\n\r\n\"What have I suffered?\" exclaimed Joseph, whose teeth chattered as if he\r\nwere having a chill, and who was no longer in a state to suppress the\r\nterrible eruption of his heart's agony. \"What have I suffered, ask you?\r\nI will tell you, empress-mother, what I have suffered since first I\r\ncould love, or think, or endure. As a child I have felt that my mother\r\nloved another son more than she loved me. When my longing eyes sought\r\nhers, they were riveted upon another face. When my brother and I have\r\nsinned together, he has been forgiven, when I have been punished. Sorrow\r\nand jealousy were in my heart, and no one cared enough for me to ask why\r\nI wept. I was left to suffer without one word of kindness--and you\r\nwondered that I was taciturn, and mocked at my slighted longings for\r\nlove, and called them by hard names. And then you pointed to my caressed\r\nand indulged brother, and bade me be gay like him!\"\r\n\r\n\"My son, my son!\" cried the emperor, \"control yourself; you know not\r\nwhat you say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let him go on, Francis,\" said the pale mother, \"it is well that I\r\nshould know his heart at last.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" continued the maddened archduke, \"let me go on, for in my heart\r\nthere is nothing but misery and slighted affection. Oh, mother, mother!\"\r\nexclaimed he, suddenly changing from defiance to the most pathetic\r\nentreaty, \"on my knees I implore you to let me go; have mercy, have\r\nmercy upon your wretched son!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the young prince, with outstretched hands, threw himself upon his\r\nknees before his mother. The long-suppressed tears gushed forth, and the\r\nwild tempest of his ungovernable fury was spent, and now he sobbed as if\r\nindeed his young heart was breaking.\r\n\r\nThe emperor could scarcely restrain the impulse he felt to weep with his\r\nson; but he came and laid his hand upon the poor boy's head, and looked\r\nwith passionate entreaty at the empress.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Theresa,\" said he, \"be compassionate and forgiving. Pardon him,\r\nbeloved, the hard and unjust words which, in the bitterness of a first\r\nsorrow, he has spoken to the best of mothers. Raise him up from the\r\ndepths of his despair, and grant the boon, for which, I am sure, he will\r\nlove you beyond bounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish that I dared to grant it to yourself, Francis,\" replied the\r\nempress, sadly and tearfully; \"but you see that he has made it\r\nimpossible. I dare not do it. The mother has no right to plead with the\r\nempress for her rebellious son. What he has said I freely forgive--God\r\ngrant that I may forget it! Well do I know how stormy is youth, and I\r\nremember that Joseph is my son. It is the wild Spanish blood of my\r\nancestry that boils in his veins, and, therefore, I forgive him with all\r\nmy heart. But revoke my last sentence--that I cannot do. To do so would\r\nbe to confirm him in wrong. Rise, my son Joseph--I forgive all your\r\ncruel words; but what I have said, I have said. You remain at home.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph rose slowly from his knees. The tears in his eyes were dried; his\r\nlips were compressed, and once more he wore the old look of cold and\r\nsullen indifference. He made a profound inclination before his mother.\r\n\"I have heard the empress's commands,\" said he, in a hoarse and\r\nunnatural voice; \"it is my duty to obey. Allow me to go to my prison,\r\nthat I may doff this manly garb, which is no longer suitable to my\r\nblasted career.\"\r\n\r\nWithout awaiting the answer, he turned away, and with hasty strides left\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nThe empress watched him in speechless anxiety. As the door closed upon\r\nhim, her features assumed an expression of tenderness and she said: \"Go\r\nquickly, Franz--go after him. Try to comfort and sustain him. I do not\r\nknow why, but I feel uneasy--\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment a cry was heard in the anteroom, and the fall of a heavy\r\nbody to the floor.\r\n\r\n\"God help me--it is Joseph!\" shrieked the empress; and, forgetting all\r\nceremony, she darted from the room, and rushed by her dismayed\r\nattendants through the anteroom, out into the corridor. Stretched on the\r\nfloor, insensible and lifeless, lay her son.\r\n\r\nWithout a word the empress waved off the crowd that was assembled around\r\nhis body. The might of her love gave her supernatural strength, and\r\nfolding her arms around her child, she covered his pale face with\r\nkisses, and from the very midst of the frightened attendants she bore\r\nhim herself to her room, where she laid him softly upon her own bed.\r\n\r\nNo one except the emperor had ventured to follow. He stood near, and\r\nreached the salts, to which the empress had silently pointed. She rubbed\r\nher son's temples, held the salts to his nostrils, and at last, when he\r\ngave signs of life, she turned to the emperor and burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Franz,\" said she, \"I almost wish that he were sick, that day and\r\nnight I might watch by his bedside, and his poor heart might feel the\r\nfull extent of a mother's love for her first-born child.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps God granted her prayer, that these two noble hearts might no\r\nlonger be estranged, but that each might at last meet the other in the\r\nfullest confidence of mutual love.\r\n\r\nA violent attack of fever followed the swoon of the archduke. The\r\nempress never left his side. He slept in her own room, and she watched\r\nover him with gentlest and most affectionate care.\r\n\r\nWhenever Joseph awaked from his fever-dreams and unclosed his eyes\r\nthere, close to his bedside he saw the empress, who greeted him with\r\nloving words and softest caresses. Whenever, in his fever-thirst, he\r\ncalled for drink, her hand held the cup to his parched lips; and\r\nwhenever that soft, cool hand was laid upon his hot brow, he felt as if\r\nits touch chased away all pain and soothed all sorrow.\r\n\r\nWhen he recovered enough to sit up, still his mother would not consent\r\nfor him to leave her room for his own. As long as he was an invalid, he\r\nshould be hers alone. In her room, and through her loving care, should\r\nhe find returning health. His sisters and brothers assembled there to\r\ncheer him with their childish mirth, and his young friend, Dominick\r\nKaunitz, came daily to entertain him with his lively gossip. Altogether,\r\nthe archduke was happy. If he had lost fame, he had found love.\r\n\r\nOne day, when, cushioned in his great soft arm-chair, he was chatting\r\nwith his favorite tutor, Count Bathiany, the empress entered the room,\r\nher face lit up with a happy smile, while in her hands she held an etui\r\nof red morocco.\r\n\r\n\"What think you I have in this etui, dear?\" she said, coming forward,\r\nand bending over her son to bestow a kiss.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know; but I guess it is some new gift of love from my mother's\r\ndear hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--rightly guessed. It is a genuine gift of love and, with God's\r\ngrace, it may prove the brightest gift in your future crown. Since I\r\nwould not let you leave my house, my son, I feel it my duty, at least,\r\nto do my best to make your home a happy one. I also wish to show you\r\nthat, in my sight, you are no longer a boy, but a man worthy to govern\r\nyour own household. Look at the picture in this case, and if it pleases\r\nyou, my darling son, I give you, not only the portrait but the ORIGINAL\r\nalso.\"\r\n\r\nShe handed him the case, in which lay the miniature of a young girl of\r\nsurpassing beauty, whose large, dark eyes seemed to gaze upon him with a\r\nlook of melancholy entreaty.\r\n\r\nThe archduke contemplated the picture for some time, and gradually over\r\nhis pale face there stole a flush of vague delight.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" asked the empress, \"does the maiden please you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please me!\" echoed the archduke, without withdrawing his eyes from the\r\npicture. \"'Tis the image of an angel! There is something in her look so\r\nbeseeching, something in her smile so sad, that I feel as if I would\r\nfall at her feet and weep; and yet, mother--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear him, Franz,\" cried Maria Theresa to the emperor, who, unobserved\r\nby his son, had entered the room. \"Hear our own child! love in his heart\r\nwill be a sentiment as holy, as faithful, and as profound as it has been\r\nwith us for many happy years! Will you have the angel for your wife,\r\nJoseph?\"\r\n\r\nThe archduke raised his expressive eyes to the face of his mother. \"If I\r\nwill have her!\" murmured he, sadly. \"Dear mother, would she deign to\r\nlook upon me? Will she not rather turn away from him to whom the whole\r\nworld is indifferent?\"\r\n\r\n\"My precious child, she will love and honor you, as the world will do,\r\nwhen it comes to know your noble heart.\" And once more the empress bent\r\nover her son and imprinted a kiss upon his pale brow. \"It is settled\r\nthen, my son, that you shall offer your hand to this beautiful girl. In\r\none week you will have attained your nineteenth birthday, and you shall\r\ngive a good example to your sisters. Do you like the prospect?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear mother, I am perfectly satisfied.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you do not ask her name or rank?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have chosen her for me; and I take her from your hand without name\r\nor rank.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" cried the delighted empress, \"Count Bathiany, you have ever been\r\nthe favorite preceptor of the archduke. Upon you, then, shall this\r\nhonorable mission devolve. To-morrow, as ambassador extraordinary from\r\nour court, you shall go in state to ask of Don Philip of Parma the hand\r\nof his daughter Isabella for his imperial highness, the crown prince of\r\nAustria.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nAN ITALIAN NIGHT.\r\n\r\nThe moon is up, but she is hidden behind heavy masses of clouds\r\n--welcome clouds that shelter lovers' secrets. The fountains, whose\r\nsilvery showers keep such sweet time to the murmurings of love, plash\r\ngently on, hushing the sound of lovers' voices; on the bosom of yonder\r\nmarble-tinctured lake, two snow-white swans are floating silently; and,\r\nfar amid groves of myrtle and olive, the nightingale warbles her notes\r\nof love. Not a step echoes through the long avenues of the ducal park,\r\nnot a light glimmers from the windows of the ducal palace. 'Tis the hour\r\nof midnight, and gentle sleep hath come to all.\r\n\r\nTo all, save two. Stay yet awhile behind the cloud, O tell-tale moon!\r\nfor there--there are the lovers. See where fair Juliet leans from the\r\nmarble balcony; while Romeo, below, whispers of plighted vows that\r\nnaught shall cancel save--death!\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow, beloved, to-morrow, thou wilt be mine forever?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will be thine in the face of the whole world.\"\r\n\r\n\"And wilt thou never repent? Hast thou strength to brave the world's\r\nscorn for my sake?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do I need strength to stretch forth my hand for that which is dearer to\r\nme than all the world beside? Oh, there is selfishness in my love,\r\nRiccardo, for it loses sight of the dangers that will threaten thee on\r\nthe day when thou callest me wife!\"\r\n\r\n\"There is but one danger, dearest--that of losing thee! I know no\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, be cautious, for my sake. Remember, we live on Spanish soil,\r\nthough Italy's skies are overhead; and Spanish vengeance is sharp and\r\nswift. Betray not thy hopes by smile or glance--in a few davs we will be\r\nfar away in the paradise where our happiness shall be hidden from all\r\neyes, save those of angels. Be guarded therefore, dear one--for see!\r\nEven now the moon is forth again in all her splendor; and were my\r\nfather's spies to track thee!--Gracious Heaven, go! Think of Spanish\r\ndaggers, and let us part for a few short hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I will go, strengthened to turn my eyes from thy beauty, by\r\nthoughts of to-morrow's bliss! In the chapel I await thee.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will be there. The priest will not betray us?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was the friend of my childhood--we may trust him, Isabella.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, Heaven bless thee! good-night. Hark!--did I not hear something\r\nrustle in the thicket?\"\r\n\r\n\"The wind sighing through the pine-trees, love.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, adieu, till morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Adieu, sweet one!\"\r\n\r\nThe moon burst forth in full radiance, and revealed the manly form that\r\nhurried through the avenue; while clear as in noonday could be seen the\r\nslender white figure that watched his retreating steps.\r\n\r\nHe is hidden now, but she still lingers, listening enraptured to the\r\nfountain's murmur and the nightingale's song; looking upward at the moon\r\nas she wandered through heaven's pathless way, and thinking that never\r\nhad earth or sky seemed so lovely before--\r\n\r\nBut hark! What sounds are those? A cry, a fearful cry rends the air; and\r\nit comes from the thicket where, a moment before, he disappeared from\r\nher sight.\r\n\r\nShe started--then, breathless as a statue, she listened in deadly\r\nsuspense. Again that cry, that dreadful cry, pierces through the\r\nstillness of the night, freezing her young heart with horror! \"His\r\ndeath-wail!\" cried the wretched girl; and careless of danger, scarce\r\nknowing what she did, heeding nothing but the sound of her lover's\r\nvoice, she sprang from the balcony, and as though moonbeams had drawn\r\nher thither, she swung herself to the ground. For one moment her slight\r\nform wavered, then she darted forward and flew through the avenue to the\r\nthicket. Away she sped, though the moon shone so bright that she could\r\nbe distinctly seen, her own shadow following like a dusky phantom\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nBe friendly, now, fair moon, and light her to her lover, that she may\r\nlook into his eyes once more before they close forever!\r\n\r\nShe has reached the spot, and, with a low cry, she throws herself by the\r\nside of the tall figure that lies stretched at its length upon the green\r\nsward.\r\n\r\nYes, it is he; he whom she loves; the soul of her soul, the life of her\r\nlife! And he lies cold and motionless, his eyes staring blindly upon the\r\nheavens, his purple lips unclosing to exhale his last sighs, while from\r\ntwo hideous wounds in his side the blood streams over the white dress of\r\nhis betrothed. But he is not dead; his blood is still warm.\r\n\r\nShe bends over and kisses his cold lips; she tears her lace mantle from\r\nher shoulders, and, pressing it to his wounds, tries to stanch the\r\nlife-blood welling from his side. The mantle grows scarlet with his\r\ngore, but the lips are whiter and colder with each kiss. She knows,\r\nalas! that there is one nearer to him now than she--Azrael is between\r\nher and her lover. He grows colder, stiffer; and--O God!--the\r\ndeath-rattle!\r\n\r\n\"Take me with thee, take me, take me!\" screamed the despairing girl; and\r\nher arms clasped frantically around the body, until they seemed as if\r\nthey were indeed stiffening into one eternal embrace.\r\n\r\n\"Have pity, Riccardo! My life, my soul, leave me not here without thee!\r\nOne word--one look, beloved!\"\r\n\r\nShe stared at him in wild despair, and seeing that he made no sign of\r\nresponse to her passionate appeal, she raised her hands to heaven, and\r\nkneeling by his side, she prayed.\r\n\r\n\"O God, merciful God, take not his fleeting life until he has given me\r\none last word--until he has told me how long we shall be parted!\"\r\n\r\nHer arms sank heavily down, and she sought the face of the dying man,\r\nwhispering--oh, how tenderly!--\"Hear me, my own; tell me when I shall\r\nfollow thee to heaven!\"\r\n\r\nShe ceased, for suddenly she felt him tremble; his eyes moved until they\r\nmet hers, and once more a smile flitted across those blanched lips. He\r\nraised his head, and slowly his body moved, until, supported in HER\r\narms, he sat erect. Enraptured, he laid her cheek to his, and waited;\r\nfor love had called him back to life, and he would speak.\r\n\r\n\"We shall meet again in three--\"\r\n\r\nHe fell back, and with a last cry expired. Love had struggled hard with\r\ndeath; but death had won the victory.\r\n\r\nIsabel shed no tears. She closed her lover's eyes; gave him one long,\r\nlast kiss; and, as she bent over him, her hair was soaked in his blood.\r\nShe took the mantle, wet with gore, and pressed it to her heart.\r\n\"Precious mantle,\" said she, \"we need not part; in three days--or\r\nperchance he said three hours--we shall lie together in the coffin!\r\nUntil then, Riccardo, farewell!\"\r\n\r\nSlowly she turned and left the horrible place. Without faltering she\r\ncame up the long moonlit avenue, her head thrown back, and her large,\r\nlustrous eyes fixed upon heaven, as though she sought to find her\r\nlover's soul somewhere among the floating clouds.\r\n\r\nThe moon flung its radiance around her path; and ever, as she walked, it\r\ngrew brighter, until the poor, stricken child of earth looked like a\r\nglorified saint. \"God grant that it be three hours!\" murmured she;\r\n\"three days were an eternity!\"\r\n\r\nShe reached the palace, without having thought that there was no door\r\nopen by which she could enter, when suddenly a form emerged from the\r\nshadowed wall, and a woman's voice whispered:\r\n\r\n\"Quick, for Heaven's sake! the side-door is open, and all in the palace\r\nsleep!\"\r\n\r\n\"I, too, in three hours shall sleep!\" cried Isabella, triumphantly, and\r\nwith these words she fell to the ground in a swoon. [Footnote: Caroline\r\nPichler, \"Memoirs of My Life.\" Part I. page 139.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nISABELLA OF PARMA.\r\n\r\nThe Princess Isabella slept unusually late the next morning. Her little\r\nbell, that summoned the ladies of honor, had not yet rung, and the day\r\nwas far advanced. The first cameriera seemed troubled, and whispered her\r\napprehensions that the princess was sick; for she had observed, for some\r\ndays, she said, that her highness had looked pale.\r\n\r\n\"But we must go into her room, ladies,\" added she; \"for it is almost\r\ntime for her highness to visit the duke, and he never forgives an\r\nomission of ceremonial. Follow me, then; _I_ will undertake to awaken\r\nthe princess.\"\r\n\r\nShe opened the door softly, and entered the sleeping-room of the\r\nprincess, followed by the other maids of honor.\r\n\r\n\"She sleeps yet,\" said the cameriera; \"but I MUST waken her,\" murmured\r\nshe to herself, \"it is my duty.\"\r\n\r\nShe advanced, and drew aside the heavy folds of the pink silk curtains\r\nthat hung around the bed.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your highness,\" she whispered; \"but--\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped; for, to her great surprise, the princess was awake. She lay\r\nin her long white night-dress, with her hands crossed over her breast,\r\nand her head cushioned on the rose-colored pillow that contrasted\r\npainfully with the pallor of her marble-white face. Her large eyes were\r\ndistended, and fixed upon a picture of the blessed Virgin that hung at\r\nthe foot of the bed. Slowly her looks turned upon her attendants, who,\r\nbreathless and frightened, gazed upon the rosy pillow, and the pallid\r\nface that lay in its midst, dazzling their eyes with its whiteness.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me,\" again whispered the cameriera, \"it is almost noonday.\"\r\n\r\n\"What hour?\" murmured the princess.\r\n\r\n\"It is ten o'clock, your highness.\"\r\n\r\nThe princess shivered, and exclaimed, \"For three days, then!\" And\r\nturning away, she began to pray in a low voice, and none but God knew\r\nthe meaning of that whispered prayer.\r\n\r\nHer prayer over, she passed her little white hand over the dark locks\r\nthat fell around her face and made an effort to rise.\r\n\r\nHer maids of honor saw that she was ill, and hastened to assist her. The\r\nhour of the princess's toilet was to her attendants the most delightful\r\nhour of the day. From her bedchamber all ceremonial was banished; and\r\nthere, with her young companions, Isabella was accustomed to laugh,\r\njest, sing, and be as merry and as free from care as the least of her\r\nfather's subjects.\r\n\r\nPhilip of Parma was by birth a Spaniard, one of the sons of Philip the\r\nFifth. After the vicissitudes of war which wrested Naples and Parma from\r\nthe hands of Austria, Don Carlos of Spain became king of Naples, and Don\r\nPhilip, duke of Parma. Isabella, then a child of seven years, had been\r\nallowed the privilege of taking with her to Italy her young playmates,\r\nwho, for form's sake, as she grew older, became her maids of honor. But\r\nthey were her dear and chosen friends, and with them she was accustomed\r\nto speak the Spanish language only.\r\n\r\nHer mother, daughter of Louis XV., had introduced French customs into\r\nthe court of Parma, and during her life the gayety and grace of French\r\nmanners had rendered that court one of the most attractive in Europe.\r\nBut the lovely Duchess of Parma died, and with her died all that made\r\ncourt life endurable. The French language was forbidden, and French\r\ncustoms were banished. Some said that the duke had loved his wife so\r\ndeeply, that in his grief he had excluded from his court every thing\r\nsuggestive of his past happiness. Others contended that he had made her\r\nlife so wretched by his jealous and tyrannical conduct, that remorse had\r\ndriven him to banish, if possible, every reminder of the woman whom he\r\nhad almost murdered.\r\n\r\nIn the hearts of her children the mother's memory was enshrined; and the\r\nbrother and sister were accustomed for her sake, in their private\r\nintercourse, to speak HER language altogether.\r\n\r\nAt court they spoke the language of the country; and Isabella--who with\r\nher friends sang boleros and danced the cachuca; with her brother, read\r\nRacine and Corneille--was equally happy while she hung enraptured upon\r\nthe strains of Pergolese's music, or gazed entranced upon the pictures\r\nof Correggio and the Veronese. The princess herself was both a painter\r\nand musician, and no one, more than she, loved Italy and Italian art.\r\n\r\nSuch, until this wretched morning, had been the life of young Isabella.\r\nWhat was she now? A cold, white image, in whose staring eyes the light\r\nwas quenched--from whose blanched lips the smile had fled forever!\r\n\r\nHer grieved attendants could scarcely suppress their tears, as sadly and\r\nsilently they arrayed her in her rich robes; while she, not seeming to\r\nknow where she was, gazed at her own reflected image with a look of\r\nstupid horror. They dressed her beautiful hair, and bound it up in massy\r\nbraids. They smoothed it over her death-cold forehead, and shuddered to\r\nsee how like a corpse she looked. At last the task was at an end, and\r\nthe cameriera coming toward her, offered the cup of chocolate which she\r\nwas accustomed to drink at that hour. Tenderly she besought the unhappy\r\ngirl to partake of it, but Isabella waved away the cup, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Dear friend, offer me no earthly food. I pine for the banquet of\r\nangels. Let the chaplain be called to bring the viaticum. I wish to\r\nreceive the last sacraments of the dying.\"\r\n\r\nA cry of horror burst from the lips of the maids of honor.\r\n\r\n\"The chaplain! The last sacraments! For you, my beloved child?\" asked\r\nthe sobbing cameriera.\r\n\r\n\"For me,\" replied Isabella.\r\n\r\n\"Heavenly Father!\" exclaimed the aja. \"Have you then presumed to\r\nanticipate the will of God, and to go before His presence, uncalled?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, death will come to me, I will not seek it. I will endure life\r\nas long as God wills, but, in three days, I shall be called hence.\"\r\n\r\nThe young girls crowded around her, weeping, and imploring her not to\r\nleave them.\r\n\r\nIsabella's white lips parted with a strange smile. \"You tell me not to\r\ndie, dear friends; do you not see that I am already dead? My heart is\r\nbleeding.\"\r\n\r\nThe hand of the cameriera was laid upon her arm, and she whispered: \"My\r\nchild, be silent; you know not what you say.\"\r\n\r\nIsabella bowed her head, and then looking tenderly around at her\r\nkneeling companions, she said: \"Rise and sit by me, my dear girls, and\r\nlisten to what I am about to say, for we speak together for the last\r\ntime on earth. \"\r\n\r\nThe maidens arose, and obeyed, while Isabella leaned her head for a few\r\nmoments upon the bosom of her mother's friend, the cameriera. There was\r\na pause, during which the poor girl seemed to have received some comfort\r\nin those friendly arms; for she finally sighed, and, raising her head\r\nagain, she spoke solemnly, but not unnaturally.\r\n\r\n\"I had last night a singular vision,\" she said. \"The spirit of my mother\r\nappeared to me, and said that in three days I was to die. I believe in\r\nthis vision. Do not weep, dear sisters; I go to eternal rest. Life is\r\nbitter, death is sweet. Pray for me, that my mother's prophetic words be\r\nverified; and you, beloved friend of that mother,\" added she, kissing\r\nthe cameriera's cheek, \"you who know the depths of my heart, and its\r\nsecret, silent agony, pray for your child, and praying, ask of her\r\nheavenly Father--death.\"\r\n\r\nThe aja made no reply, she was weeping with the others.\r\n\r\nIsabella contemplated the group for a moment, while a ray of life lit up\r\nher eyes, showing that, even now, it was sad to part from her friends\r\nforever. But the expression was momentary. Her face returned to its\r\ndeadly paleness, as gasping for breath, she stammered:\r\n\"Now--now--for--my father! Estrella, go to the apartments of the duke,\r\nand say that I desire an interview with his royal highness.\"\r\n\r\nThe young girl returned in a few moments with an answer. His royal\r\nhighness had that morning gone some distance in the country on a hunting\r\nexcursion, and would be absent for several days.\r\n\r\nIsabella looked at the cameriera, who still stood beside her, and her\r\npale lips quivered. \"Did I not know it?\" whispered she; \"I told you\r\ntruly, HE did it! God forgive him, I cannot.--And now,\" continued she,\r\naloud, \"now to my last earthly affairs.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, she called for her caskets of jewels and divided them between\r\nthe young maids of honor; and cutting from her hair one rich, massy\r\nlock, she placed it in Estrella's hand, saying, \"Share it among you\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\nTo the cameriera she gave a sealed packet, and then bade them leave her\r\nto herself; for the ringing of the chapel bell announced the departure\r\nof the priest thence, with the blessed sacrament.\r\n\r\nThe sacred rites were ended. On her knees the Princess Isabella had made\r\nher confession, and had revealed to the shuddering priest the horrible\r\nsecrets of the preceding night. She had received absolution, and had\r\npartaken of the holy communion.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my child,\" said the priest, in a voice tremulous with sympathy,\r\n\"you have received the blessing of God, and you are prepared for His\r\ncoming. May He be merciful to you, and grant your prayer for release\r\nfrom this earth! I, too, will pray that your martyrdom be short.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen!\" softly murmured Isabella.\r\n\r\n\"But the ways of the Lord are inscrutable, and it may be that He wills\r\nit otherwise. If, in His incomprehensible wisdom, He should declare that\r\nyour days shall be long on this earth, promise me to endure your lot\r\nwith resignation, nor seek to hasten what He has deemed it best to\r\ndelay?\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise, holy father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make a vow, then, to the Lord, that by the memory of your mother you\r\nwill fulfil every duty that presents itself to you in life, until God\r\nhas spoken the word that will call you to Himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I swear, by the memory of my mother, that I will live a life of\r\nresignation and of usefulness until God in His mercy, shall free me from\r\nmy prison.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right, dear unhappy child,\" said the father, smoothing, with his\r\ntrembling hands, the soft hair that lay on either side of her forehead.\r\n\"May God reward thee, and in His infinite mercy shorten thy sufferings!\"\r\n\r\nHe stooped, and kissing her pale brow, made the sign of the cross above\r\nher kneeling figure. Then, with eyes blinded by tears, he slowly\r\nretreated to his own room, where he threw himself upon his knees and\r\nprayed that God would give strength to them both to bear the cross of\r\nthat dreadful secret.\r\n\r\nIsabella, too, remained alone. In feverish longing for death, she sat,\r\nneither hearing the voices of her friends who begged for admission, nor\r\nthe pleadings of her brother, who besought her to see him and give him\r\none last embrace. Through the long night that followed, still kneeling,\r\nshe prayed. When the sun rose, she murmured, \"To-morrow!\" and through\r\nthe day her fancy wandered to the verge of madness. Sometimes visions of\r\nbeckoning angels swarmed around her; then they fled, and in their places\r\nstood a hideous skeleton, that, with ghastly smile, held out his\r\nfleshless hand, and strove to clasp hers.\r\n\r\nAgain the night set in, and the next morning at break of day, Isabella\r\nrose from her knees, and, hailing the rising sun, cried exultingly,\r\n\"To-day!\"\r\n\r\nExhausted from fasting and such long vigils, her head reeled, and she\r\nstaggered to her couch. A cold shudder crept over her limbs; all was\r\ndark as night about her; she tried to clasp her hands in prayer and\r\ncould not, for they were numb and powerless. \"This is welcome death!\"\r\nthought she, and her lips parted with a happy smile. Her head fell\r\nbackward on the pillow, and her senses fled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY.\r\n\r\nThe Princess Isabella opened her eyes, and in their dark and lustrous\r\ndepths shone returning reason; they glared no more with fever-madness,\r\nbut were sadder and sweeter than ever.\r\n\r\nShe gazed at the forms that surrounded her bedside; at the priest, who,\r\nwith folded hands, was praying at her head; at the cameriera, who knelt\r\nbeside him; at the young girls, who, gathered in a lovely group at her\r\nfeet, smiled and wept by turns as she looked upon them; and lastly, she\r\nfelt a kiss upon her hand, and, looking there, she beheld her brother,\r\nwho wept with joy.\r\n\r\n\"Where am I?\" asked she, feebly.\r\n\r\n\"You are with those who love you best, darling,\" said Fernando,\r\njoyfully. \"With us, who have prayed so long, that the good God has heard\r\nand restored you to life.\"\r\n\r\n\"I still live, then,\" said she, sadly. \"And how long have I lain here,\r\nfriends?\"\r\n\r\nThe priest advanced, and blessing her, took her by the hand. \"For four\r\nweeks, daughter, you have been unconscious of every thing that passed\r\naround you. You see, therefore, that your heavenly Father bids you\r\nlive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Four weeks?\" whispered the poor girl. \"Then, in three months we shall\r\nmeet again.\"\r\n\r\nShe closed her eyes, and lay silent for a while. At length, the priest,\r\nbending close to her ear, whispered, \"Think, daughter, of the vows,\r\nwhich, by the memory of your mother, you have made to God!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will remember them,\" murmured she, sadly.\r\n\r\nAnd from this day she mended, until life and strength were restored to\r\nher even as before. She thought of her vow, and made no resistance to\r\nthe will of Heaven; but she hoped for death, and awaited her three\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nSustained by these hopes, she recovered. But her heart was wounded past\r\nall cure; gone were her smiles and her songs. Quietly, sadly, and\r\nsolemnly glided away the new life to which she had been born through\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe first day on which she felt able to leave her room, she sent to\r\ncrave an audience of her father. She had been told that, during her\r\ndelirium, he had often visited her chamber; but, since her\r\nconvalescence, he had not sent so much as an inquiry after her health.\r\n\r\nHe did not, however, deny the interview she sought. He awaited his\r\ndaughter, said the messenger, in his own apartments.\r\n\r\nThe princess shuddered, and a deadly faintness came over her.\r\n\r\n\"My God! my God! will I ever be able to go through this bitter hour?\r\nMust I, indeed, look upon him who--\"\r\n\r\nShe closed her eyes to shut out the frightful remembrance. Then,\r\ngathering all her strength for the trial, she rose to seek her father,\r\nand make one last request of him.\r\n\r\nWith her head thrown proudly back, and her dark eyes flashing with\r\nresolve, she entered his cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe duke was entirely alone. He had dismissed his attendants, and now\r\nstood in the centre of the room, awaiting his daughter in gloomy\r\nsilence. His cold, stern features had grown more repulsive than ever to\r\nthe unhappy girl; his piercing eyes more revengeful; his thin, pale lips\r\nmore cruel. He seemed to her a pitiless stranger, and she could not\r\nadvance to meet him. Powerless and faint, she stood at the door; all her\r\nstrength gone.\r\n\r\nA few moments of anguish went by, and then the duke, extending his hand,\r\nsaid, in a tone of command, \"Come hither, Isabella.\"\r\n\r\nShe stepped forward, and almost touched his hand, when, shuddering, her\r\narm dropped heavily down, and forgetting all caution, she murmured, in\r\ntones of deepest agony, \"I cannot! I cannot!\"\r\n\r\nThe duke's eyes shot fire, as he, too, dropped his extended hand, and\r\ndeep, angry folds wrinkled his forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Why have you desired this interview?\" asked he.\r\n\r\n\"I have a request to prefer, my father,\" replied Isabella.\r\n\r\nHe bent his head. \"Speak,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"I come to entreat of my father the permission to take the veil.\"\r\n\r\n\"And wherefore, I should like to know?\" said the duke, carelessly.\r\n\r\n\"That I may dedicate my few remaining days to the service of the Lord.\"\r\n\r\n\"Girlish folly!\" said he, with a contemptuous laugh, while he paced up\r\nand down the room.\r\n\r\nIsabella made no reply, but stood awaiting a more direct answer to her\r\npetition. Suddenly, he came up to her, and spoke:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot grant your request,\" said he. \"I have other plans for you. The\r\ngrandchild of the King of Spain cannot be permitted to die a penitent in\r\na cloister; if she has atonement to make for crime, let her make it, not\r\nunder the serge of the nun, but under the purple of the empress.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no ambition,\" said Isabella, trembling. \"Allow me, I entreat\r\nyou, to enter a convent.\"\r\n\r\n\"I repeat that I have other plans for you. I, too, have no ambition for\r\nYOU,\" said the father, coldly, \"but I am ambitious for my house, and\r\nthrough you I shall attain my end. One of the greatest monarchs of\r\nEurope has sought your hand for the heir of her throne, and I have\r\nresolved that you shall become his wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fate will refuse it to him--Fate, more merciful than my father. I have\r\nbut a few weeks to live--before a month has elapsed, I shall be in my\r\ngrave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go there, if it pleases you,\" cried the duke, \"but die with royal robes\r\nabout you. You shall not die a nun.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one on earth, my father, has a right to detain me. If your highness\r\nrefuse your consent. I will fly to a convent without your permission.\r\nAnd princely though you be, you shall not drag from the altar the bride\r\nof the Lord.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you rebel against my authority!\" cried the duke, with a look that\r\nsent a deadly pang to the heart of his daughter. \"Know, that I have\r\npower to judge you for such treason, and lay your defiant head upon the\r\nblock!\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not fear death,\" replied Isabella; \"I await it with impatience.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you are possessed with a lovesick desire to die! But hear what I\r\nhave to say, and mark it well. I will relate to you an affair that took\r\nplace--whilst you were ill. The only son of one of the noblest families\r\nin Parma, the pride of his race, and the idol of his parents, conceived\r\na plot against my house, whose treason was equal to parricide. I learned\r\nhis designs; and with my own eyes and my own ears, I verified his guilt.\r\nHe was an archtraitor; he had deserved to die on the scaffold. But I had\r\npity on his family, and spared them the disgrace of a public execution.\r\nI took his life secretly, and his parents are spared the shame of\r\nknowing how he died. Shall I tell you the name of this dead traitor?\"\r\n\r\nIsabella raised her hand, and parting her blanched lips, she said\r\nhoarsely, \"No no! in mercy, no!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then I proceed. This traitor, whom I judged, and to whom I\r\ndeat his death-stab, had an accomplice. Do you listen?\"\r\n\r\nLike a broken lily, Isabella's head sank down upon her breast.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you listen. The accomplice is placed in a position which makes it\r\ninexpedient for me to punish her in her own person. But should she\r\nthwart me, should she not fully and cheerfully comply with my demands\r\nupon her loyalty, I will see that she suffers more than death in the\r\nfamily of her accomplice. I shall publish the guilt of the dead criminal\r\nto the whole world; I will disgrace and dishonor his whole race, and his\r\nyoung sister, with her parents, shall be driven penniless from my\r\nrealms, to beg or starve in a stranger land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Father!\" cried the wretched girl, while her every limb quivered with\r\nthe torture he inflicted, \"I am ready to do your will. I will marry whom\r\nyou choose, and so long as God condemns me to earth, I will obey you in\r\nall things. But you shall promise me on your princely honor to shield\r\nfrom all shame or harm the family of--of--the deceased; to befriend his\r\nsister, and if she should ever wish to marry, to honor and favor her\r\nchoice. Promise me this, and as long as I live I submit to your will.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise, on my honor, to do all this, and to forget for their sakes\r\nthe crime of their son.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise also, on my sacred honor, to accept the husband you have\r\nchosen for me. But I will not suffer long, for my life is almost spent.\"\r\n\r\nThe duke shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Your highness,\" continued his daughter, \"will inform me on what day I\r\nam to be affianced. I await your commands, and beg your highness's\r\npermission to withdraw to my apartments.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you nothing more to say to your father, Isabella?\" asked he in a\r\nfaltering voice.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing more to say to your royal highness.\" She courtesied deeply,\r\nand, without a glance at her father, left the room.\r\n\r\nThe duke looked after her with an expression of sorrow. \"I have lost her\r\nforever!\" said he. \"When I struck him, I pierced her heart also. Well,\r\nso let it be! Better a dead child than a dishonored house!\"\r\n\r\nHe then rang a little golden bell, and ordered preparations to be made\r\nfor another grand hunt on the morrow.\r\n\r\nIsabella accepted her destiny nobly. She resolved to fulfil her promises\r\nstrictly; but she hoped that God would be satisfied with the sacrifice,\r\nand release her before the day of her nuptials.\r\n\r\nFinally came the day on which, for the third time, she had hoped to die.\r\nShe felt a solemn joy steal over her heart, and she desired her maids of\r\nhonor to deck her in bridal white. Her dark hair was wreathed with\r\norange-blossoms, and in her bosom she wore an orange-bud. She was lovely\r\nbeyond expression, and her attendants whispered among themselves, though\r\nIsabella neither saw nor heard them. She who awaited death took no heed\r\nof what was going on around her in the palace.\r\n\r\nAnd yet her stake in that palace was great. On the day before the\r\nembassy had arrived, which was to change her fate, and open to her a new\r\nlife at the court of the Austrian empress.\r\n\r\nThe duke had received his guests with royal courtesy. But he had\r\nbesought the count to postpone his interview with the princess until the\r\nmorrow; for with cruel mockery of his child's sorrow, Philip of Parma\r\nhad contrived that the day on which she had hoped to meet her dead\r\nlover, should be the day of her betrothal to the Archduke of Austria.\r\n\r\nIsabella was the only person in the palace who had not heard of the\r\narrival. She had withdrawn into her private cabinet, and there she\r\ncounted every pulsation of her heart. She dared not hope to die a\r\nnatural death; she was looking forward to some accident that was to\r\nrelease her from life; something direct from the hand of God she thought\r\nwould, on that day, make good the prophecy of her lover.\r\n\r\nShe hoped, watched, prayed. She was startled from her solitude by a\r\nknocking at the door, and her father's voice called for admission.\r\n\r\nThe princess, obedient to her promise, rose and opened the door. Her\r\nfather surveyed her with a smile of derision. \"You have done well,\" said\r\nhe, \"to deck yourself as a bride; not as the bride of Death, but as the\r\naffianced wife of the LIVING lover who will one day make you empress of\r\nAustria. His ambassador awaits us now in the great hall of state. Follow\r\nme into the next room, where your maids of honor are assembled to attend\r\nyou. Mark me, Isabella! When we arrive in the hall, the ambassador will\r\nadvance, and in terms befitting the honor conferred, he will request\r\nyour acceptance of the archduke's hand. I leave it to your tact and\r\ndiscretion to answer him as becomes the princess of a great and royal\r\nhouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"And will your highness perform your promise to ME?\" asked Isabella\r\ncalmly. \"Shall his parents live secure in possession of their noble name\r\nand estates; and shall his sister be the special object of your\r\nhighness's protection and favor?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do all this, provided you give me satisfaction as relates to\r\nyour marriage.\"\r\n\r\nIsabella bowed. \"Then I am ready to accompany your royal highness to the\r\nhall of state, and to accept with courtesy the offer of the Austrian\r\nambassador.\"\r\n\r\nForth went the beautiful martyr and her train through the gorgeous\r\napartments of the palace, until they reached the hall of the throne.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the hall the duke left his daughter and her attendants,\r\nwhile he mounted the throne and took his seat upon the ducal chair.\r\n\r\nAnd now advanced Count Bathiany. With all the fervor which her matchless\r\nbeauty inspired, he begged of the princess her fair hand for his future\r\nsovereign the Archduke of Austria. As the count ceased, every eye turned\r\ntoward the infanta. She had listened with calm dignity to the words of\r\nthe ambassador, and her large, melancholy eyes had been riveted upon his\r\nface while he delivered his errand. There was a pause--a few moments\r\nwere needed by that broken heart to hush its moanings, and bare itself\r\nfor the sacrifice. The brow of the duke darkened, and he was about to\r\ninterpose, when he saw his daughter bow her head. Then she spoke, and\r\nevery one bent forward to listen to the silvery tones of her voice.\r\n\r\n\"I feel deeply honored,\" said she, \"by the preference of her imperial\r\nmajesty of Austria; an alliance with her eldest son is above my deserts;\r\nbut since it is their desire, I accept the great honor conferred upon\r\nme. I regret, however, that their majesties should have directed their\r\nchoice toward me; for I am convinced that I shall not live long enough\r\nto fulfil the destiny to which this marriage calls me.\" [Footnote: The\r\ninfanta's own words; as veritably historical as is this whole relation\r\nof her death-prophecy and its unhappy fulfilment. See Wraxall, \"Memoirs\r\nof the Courts,\" etc., and Caroline Pichler.]\r\n\r\nWhen at last the ceremonies of this day of agony were ended; when the\r\ninfanta had dismissed her ladies of honor, and was once more\r\nalone--alone with God and with the past, she threw herself upon her\r\ncouch, and, with her hands meekly folded across her breast, she lay,\r\nlooking up, far beyond the palace dome to heaven.\r\n\r\nThere she prayed until midnight, and when the clock had told the hour,\r\nshe arose to the new life that awaited her, with its new promises, new\r\nexpectations, new ties--but no new hopes.\r\n\r\n\"Heavenly Father,\" exclaimed she, \"it has begun, and I will bear it to\r\nthe bitter end! I am now the betrothed, and soon will be the wife of\r\nanother. If I have sinned in my consent to marry one whom I can never\r\nlove, pardon me, O Lord! and hear me vow that I will faithfully fulfil\r\nmy duty toward him. I am the affianced of another! Farewell, my beloved,\r\nfarewell, FOR THREE LONG YEARS!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE DREAM OF LOVE.\r\n\r\nThe wedding-festival was over, and Vienna was resting from the fatigue\r\nof the brilliant entertainments by which the marriage of the archduke\r\nhad been followed, both in court and city. And indeed the rejoicings had\r\nbeen conducted with imperial magnificence. For eight days, the people of\r\nVienna, without respect of rank, had been admitted to the palace, to\r\nwitness the court festivities; while in the city and at Schonbrunn,\r\nnightly balls were given at the expense of the empress, where the happy\r\nViennese danced and feasted to their hearts' content.\r\n\r\nThey had returned the bounty of their sovereign by erecting triumphal\r\narches, strewing the ground with flowers, and rending the air with\r\nshouts, whenever the young archduchess had appeared in the streets.\r\n\r\nThe great maestro Gluck had composed an opera for the occasion; and\r\nwhen, on the night of its representation, the empress made her\r\nappearance in the imperial loge, followed by the archduke and his bride,\r\nthe enthusiasm of the people was so great that Gluck waited a quarter of\r\nan hour, baton in hand, before he could begin his overture.\r\n\r\nBut now the jubilee was over, the shouts were hushed, the people had\r\nreturned to their accustomed routine of life, and the exchequer of the\r\nempress was minus--one million of florins.\r\n\r\nThe court had withdrawn to the palace of Schonbrunn, there to enjoy in\r\nprivacy the last golden days of autumn, as well as to afford to the\r\nnewly-married pair a taste of that retirement so congenial to lovers.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa, always munificent, had devoted one wing of the palace to\r\nthe exclusive use of her young daughter-in-law; and her apartments were\r\nfitted up with the last degree of splendor. Elegant mirrors, buhl and\r\ngilded furniture, costly turkey carpets and exquisite paintings adorned\r\nthis princely home; and as the princess was known to be skilled both as\r\na painter and musician, one room was fitted up for her as a studio, and\r\nanother as a music-hall.\r\n\r\nFrom the music-room, a glass door led to a balcony filled with rare and\r\nbeautiful flowers. This balcony overlooked the park, and beyond was seen\r\nthe city, made lovely by the soft gray veil of distance, which lends\r\nsuch beauty to a landscape.\r\n\r\nOn this perfumed balcony sat the youthful pair. Isabella reclined in an\r\narm-chair; and at her feet on a low ottoman sat Joseph, looking up into\r\nher face, his eyes beaming with happiness. It was a lovely sight--that\r\nof these two young creatures, who, in the sweet, still evening, sat\r\ntogether, unveiling to one another the secrets of two blameless hearts,\r\nand forgetting rank, station, and the world, were tasting the pure joys\r\nof happily wedded love.\r\n\r\nThe evening breeze whispered Nature's soft low greeting to them both;\r\nand through the myrtle-branches that, hanging over the balcony,\r\nclustered around Isabella's head, the setting sun flung showers of gold\r\nthat lit up her face with the glory of an angel. Bright as an angel\r\nseemed she to her husband, who, sitting at her feet, gazed enraptured\r\nupon her. How graceful he thought the contour of her oval face; how rich\r\nthe scarlet of her lovely mouth; what noble thoughts were written on her\r\npale and lofty brow, and how glossy were the masses of her raven black\r\nhair! And those wondrous eyes! Dark and light, lustrous and dim, at one\r\nmoment they flashed with intellect, at another they glistened with\r\nunshed tears. Her form, too, was slender and graceful, for Nature had\r\ndenied her nothing; and the charm of her appearance (above all, to an\r\neve weary of splendor) was made complete by the vapory muslin dress that\r\nfell around her perfect figure like a silver-white cloud. The only\r\nornament that flecked its snow was a bunch of pink roses, which the\r\narchduke with his own hand had culled for his wife that morning. She\r\nwore them in her bosom, and they were the crowning beauty of that\r\nsimple, elegant dress.\r\n\r\nIsabella's head rested amongst the myrtle-branches; her eyes were fixed\r\nupon the heavens, with a look of ineffable sadness, and gradually the\r\nsmile had died from her lips. Her countenance contrasted singularly with\r\nthat of the archduke. Since his marriage, he had grown handsomer than\r\never; and from his bright expressive face beamed the silent eloquence of\r\na young and joyful existence.\r\n\r\nIn his joy he did not see the painful shadows that were darkening his\r\nwife's pale beauty. For a while, a deep stillness was about them.\r\nFlooded by the gold of the setting sun, lay the park at their feet;\r\nfarther off glimmered the domes of St. Stephen at Vienna, and faint over\r\nthe evening air came the soothing tones of the vesper-bell.\r\n\r\n\"How beautiful is the world!\" said Joseph, at length; and, at the sound\r\nof his voice, suddenly breaking the stillness that had been so congenial\r\nto her reveries, Isabella started. A slight shiver ran through her\r\nframe, and her eyes unwillingly came back to earth. He did not see it.\r\n\"Oh, how lovely is life, my Isabella, now that the music of thy heart\r\nreplies to mine! Never has earth seemed to me so full of beauty, as it\r\ndoes now that I call thee wife.\"\r\n\r\nIsabella laid her soft hand upon her husband's head, and looked at him\r\nfor a while. At length she stifled a sigh, and said, \"Are you then\r\nhappy, my husband?\"\r\n\r\nHe drew down the little hand that was resting on his blonde curls and\r\nkissed it fervently. \"A boon, my beloved. When we are alone, let us\r\nbanish Spanish formality from our intercourse. Be the future empress\r\nbefore the world, but to me be my wife, and call me 'thou.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" replied she, blushing. \"And I repeat my question, art thou\r\nhappy, my husband?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell thee, dearest. There seems within me such a flood of melody\r\nseeking voice, that sometimes, for very ecstasy, I feel as if I must\r\nshout aloud all the pent-up joy that other men have frittered away from\r\nboyhood, and I have garnered up for this hour. Again I feel intoxicated\r\nwith happiness, and fear that I am dreaming. I tremble lest some rude\r\nhand awake me, and I look around for proof of my sober, waking bliss. I\r\nfind it, and then breaks forth my soul in hosannas to God. And when,\r\nmingling among men, I see a face that looks sad or pale, I feel such\r\nsympathy for him who is less happy than I, that I make vows, when I am\r\nemperor, to heal all sorrow, and wipe away all tears. Then come great\r\nand noble aspirations, and I long to give back to my people the\r\nblessings with which they greeted thee, my own Isabella. This is not one\r\nfeeling, but the meeting of many. Is it happiness, dearest?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell,\" replied she; \"for happiness is a thing so heavenly in\r\nits nature, that one hardly dares to give it a name, lest it take\r\nflight, and soar back to its home above the skies. Let us not press it\r\ntoo closely, lest we seek it and it be gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall do as it pleases thee,\" said Joseph, snatching her two hands,\r\nand pressing them to his heart. \"I know that when thou art by, Happiness\r\nis here, and she cannot go back to heaven, unless she take thee too.\"\r\nAnd again he looked at his wife, as if he would fair have blended their\r\ndual being into one.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to make thee a confession, Isabel,\" resumed he. \"It is a great\r\ncrime, dearest, but thou wilt give me absolution, I know. As I look\r\nback, I can scarce believe it myself, but--hear. When the empress gave\r\nme thy miniature, beautiful though it was, I gave my consent to marry,\r\nbut my heart was untouched. When Count Bathiany departed on his mission,\r\nI prayed that every obstacle might encumber his advance: and oh, my\r\nbeloved! when I heard that thou wert coming, I almost wished thee buried\r\nunder Alpine avalanches. When I was told of thy arrival, I longed to fly\r\naway from Vienna, from rank and royalty, to some far country, some\r\nsecluded spot, where no reasons of state policy would force me to give\r\nmy hand to an unknown bride. Was I not a barbarian, sweetest, was I not\r\nan arch-traitor?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, thou wert only a boy-prince, writhing under the heavy load of thy\r\nroyalty.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I was a criminal; but oh, how I have expiated my sin! When I saw\r\nthee my heart leaped into life; and now it trembles lest thou love not\r\nme! But thou wilt love me, wilt thou not? thou who hast made me so happy\r\nthat I wish I had a hundred hearts; for one is not enough to contain the\r\nlove I feel for thee!\" [Footnote: These are his own words. Caroccioli\r\n\"Life of Joseph II.\"]\r\n\r\nIsabella was gazing at him with a melancholy smile. \"Dreamer!\" said she,\r\nin a low trembling tone, that sounded to Joseph like heavenly music--\"\r\ndreamer! the heart that through God's goodness is filled with love is of\r\nitself supernaturally magnified; for love is a revelation from heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sweet priestess of love! how truly thou art the interpreter of our\r\npassion! For it is OURS, my Isabella, is it not? It is our love of which\r\nwe speak, not mine alone. I have confessed to thee; now do the same by\r\nme. Tell me, my wife, didst thou hate the man to whom thy passive hand\r\nwas given, without one thought of thee or of thy heart's predilections?\"\r\n\r\nHow little he guessed the torture he inflicted! He looked into her eyes\r\nwith such trusting faith, with such calm security of happiness, that her\r\nsweet face beamed with tender pity, while her cheeks deepened into\r\nscarlet blushes, as she listened to his passionate declarations of love.\r\nPoor Isabella!\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said she, \"no, I never hated thee, Joseph. I had already heard\r\nenough to feel esteem for my future husband; and, therefore, I did not\r\nhate, I pitied him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pity him, my own, and wherefore?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because without consulting HIS heart, he was affianced to an unknown\r\ngirl, unworthy to be the partner of his brilliant destiny. Poor Isabella\r\nof Parma was never made to be an empress, Joseph.\"\r\n\r\n\"She was, she was! She is fit to be empress of the world, for all\r\npoetry, all goodness, all intellect and beauty look out from the depths\r\nof her lustrous eyes. Oh, look upon me, star of my life, and promise to\r\nguide me ever with thy holy light!\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he took her in his arms, and pressed her to his tender, manly\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\"Promise me, beloved;\" whispered he, \"promise never to leave me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise,\" said the pale wife, \"never to forsake thee, until God calls\r\nme hence to--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" interrupted Joseph, \"may that hour never strike till I be in\r\nheaven to receive thee; for love is selfish, Isabella, and my daily\r\nprayer is now, that thy dear hand may close my eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"God will not hear that prayer, Joseph,\" replied Isabella; and as she\r\nspoke, her head sank upon his shoulder, and her long hair fell from its\r\nfastening, and, like a heavy mourning-veil, shrouded them both. Her\r\nhusband held her close to his heart, and as he kissed her, she felt his\r\ntears drop upon her cheek.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" said he, \"why it is, but I feel sometimes as if a\r\ntempest were gathering above my head. And yet, the heavens are\r\ncloudless, the sun has set; and see, the moon rises, looking in her pale\r\nbeauty, even as thou dost, my love. She has borrowed loveliness from\r\nthee to-night, for, surely, she was never so fair before. But all seems\r\nlovely when thou art near, and, I think, that, perchance--thou lovest\r\nme. Tell me, Isabella, tell me, dearest, that thou dost love me.\"\r\n\r\nShe raised her head, and met his passionate gaze with a look so sad that\r\nhis heart grew cold with apprehension. Then her eyes turned heavenward,\r\nand her lips moved. He knew that she was praying. But why, at such a\r\nmoment?\r\n\r\n\"Tell me the truth!\" cried he, vehemently--\"tell me the truth!\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot answer thee in words,\" murmured Isabella, \"but thou shalt have\r\nmusic--love's own interpreter. Come, let us go into the music-room.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, light as a fairy, she tripped before, opening herself the door,\r\nthough he strove to prevent her.\r\n\r\n\"No, this is MY temple, and my hands unclose the doors,\" said she, once\r\nmore self-possessed.\r\n\r\nHer husband followed her, enchanted. She looked around at the various\r\ninstruments, and struck a few chords on the piano.\r\n\r\n\"No. This is too earthly. My own favorite instrument shall speak for\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, she opened a case that lay on the table, and took from it a\r\nviolin.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" said she to her husband, \"is the violin that came with me from\r\nItaly.\"\r\n\r\n\"How, Isabella,\" exclaimed he, \"dost thou play on my favorite\r\ninstrument?\"\r\n\r\n\"The violin, to me, is dear above all instruments,\" replied she; \"it\r\nalone has tones that respond to those of the human heart.\" [Footnote:\r\nThe infanta, who played on several instruments, excelled on the violin.\r\nWraxall, vol. ii., page 390.]\r\n\r\nWith indescribable grace she raised the violin to her shoulder, and\r\nbegan to play. At first her chords were light and airy as the sounds\r\nfrom an AEolian harp; then the melody swelled until it broke into a gush\r\nof harmony that vibrated through every chord of the archduke's beating\r\nheart. As he stood breathless and entranced, she seemed to him like that\r\npicture by Fiesole, of the angel that comforts the dying. This\r\npicture had always been, above all others, the archduke's favorite, and\r\nnow it stood embodied before him, a living, breathing divinity.\r\n\r\nThe music died away to his ear, though still she played; but now it\r\nseemed to stream from her eyes that shone like luminous stars, and flow\r\nfrom her softly moving lips, that whispered to the spirits which now\r\nlow, now loud, laughed, sighed, or sobbed out their responses from the\r\nmagic violin.\r\n\r\nIsabella was no longer a woman and his wife. She was a glorified spirit;\r\nand now he trembled lest his angel should vanish, and leave him nothing\r\nbut the memory of a heavenly vision. His eyes filled with tears; a\r\nconvulsive sigh broke from his breast, and, burying his face in his\r\nhands, he sank down upon the sofa.\r\n\r\nA light shudder ran through Isabella's frame; her eyes, which had\r\nwandered far, far beyond the portals that shut us out from heaven,\r\nlooked wildly around. Her husband's sigh had awakened her from a\r\nblissful dream, and once more her weary heart sank desolate to the\r\nearth. But with an expression of tenderest pity she turned toward him\r\nand smiled. Then her music changed; it pealed out in rich harmony, fit\r\nfor mortal ears. She saw her complete mastery over the archduke's soul;\r\nhis eyes grew bright and joyful once more, and from his countenance\r\nbeamed the light of perfect contentment.\r\n\r\n\"Our epithalamium!\" exclaimed he, overjoyed, and no longer able to\r\ncontrol his exultation, he darted from his seat, and clasped the dear\r\nmusician in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"I thank thee, my Isabella,\" said he, with a voice that trembled with\r\nexcess of happiness. \"Yes, this is the voice of love; thou hast answered\r\nme with our wedding-song. In this melody is drowned every bitter\r\nremembrance of my life; the discords of the past have melted into\r\nrichest harmony--for thou returnest my love. A thousand times I thank\r\nthee; this hour is sacred to me forever.\r\n\r\n\"Thou hast said that thou lovest me,\" continued the happy husband, \"and\r\nnow I feel the power and strength of a god. I am ready for the battle of\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I think that I saw the god weep. Poor mortal friend, gods shed no\r\ntears--tears are the baptism of humanity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, gods must weep for joy, Isabella, else they could not feel its\r\nperfection!\"\r\n\r\n\"May Heaven grant that thou weep no other tears!\" said the wife,\r\nsolemnly. \"But hear,\" continued she, raising her little hand, \"the\r\npalace clock strikes eight, and we promised her majesty to spend this\r\nevening with the imperial family circle. We must be punctual, and I have\r\nscarcely time to dress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, wilt thou change that sweet simple dress? Art thou not always the\r\npride of the court? Come--thy muslin and roses will shame all the silk\r\nand jewels of my sisters. Come!\"\r\n\r\nShe laid her hand gently upon the arm that drew her forward, and\r\ncourtesied before him with mock ceremony.\r\n\r\n\"My lord and husband,\" said she, laughing, \"although your imperial\r\nhighness has banished Madame Etiquette from our balcony, remember that\r\nshe stands grimly awaiting us by yonder door, and we must take her with\r\nus into the presence of our august empress. Madame Etiquette would never\r\npermit me to pass in this simple dress. She would order me indignantly\r\nfrom her sight, and your highness also. Go, therefore, and don your\r\nrichest Spanish habit. In fifteen minutes I await your highness here.\"\r\n\r\nShe made another deep courtesy. The archduke, taking up the jest,\r\napproached her, and, kissing her hand, replied:\r\n\r\n\"I obey your imperial highness, as your loyal husband and loving\r\nsubject. I shall deck myself with stars and orders; and in princely\r\nsplendor I shall return, as becomes the spouse of the archduchess of\r\nAustria. Your highness's obedient servant.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in true Spanish fashion, he bent his knee and kissed the hem of her\r\nrobe. Backing out of her presence he bowed again as he reached the door,\r\nbut catching her laughing eyes, he suddenly dashed right over Madame\r\nEtiquette, and catching his wife in his arms, he gave her a last and a\r\nright burgher-like kiss. The archduke was very happy, and the\r\narchduchess--well! One day God will reward her!\r\n\r\nAs the door closed, the expression of her face changed. The smile died\r\nfrom her lips, and her eyes were dim with tears.\r\n\r\n\"Poor boy!\" murmured she, \"he loves me, and I--I suffer him to believe\r\nthat I return his love, while--But I am right,\" said the devoted girl,\r\nand she clasped her hands convulsively together.\r\n\r\n\"O my Saviour!\" cried she \"in mercy give me grace while I live, to be\r\ntrue to the vows, that before thine altar, I have sworn to the Archduke\r\nof Austria! It were cruel in me to wound his noble heart--cruel to awake\r\nhim from his dream of love! Let him at least be happy while I live; and\r\nLord give me strength that I faint not under my burden!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nGLUCK.\r\n\r\nThe sun had risen, flooding the earth with light, and the people of\r\nVienna had already begun their labors for the day. But the curtains had\r\nnot yet been drawn from a richly-furnished room, whose walls were lined\r\nwith books; and in whose centre stood a table covered with papers,\r\nwhereon the lights, not yet extinguished, were dropping their waxen\r\ntears from two lofty silver candelabra. At this table sat a man, looking\r\nearnestly at a paper covered with notes of music. He had sat there the\r\nwhole night long, and his countenance gave no indication of the\r\nexhaustion that follows upon night-watching. His large, dark, gray eyes\r\nflashed whenever he raised his head thoughtfully, as he frequently did;\r\nand when music was born of his thoughts, a smile illuminated his\r\notherwise plain face, and a wonderful light played about his magnificent\r\nforehead; the glory of that genius which had made it her dwelling-place.\r\n\r\nThe form of this man was as striking as his face. Tall and commanding in\r\nstature, his wide shoulders seemed proudly to bear the weight of the\r\nhead that towered above them, and in his lofty bearing there was a\r\ndignitv that betokened either rank or genius.\r\n\r\nHe had both; for this man was Christopher von Gluck, son of a huntsman\r\nof Prince Eugene, who was born in 1714 in the village of Weidenwang.\r\n\r\nThis son of the poor huntsman was known throughout all Europe; and in\r\nItaly, the nobles in their palaces and the people on the streets sang\r\nthe melodies of Phedra, Antigone, Semiramide, and Telemacco. In Germany\r\nhe was less known; and in Vienna alone, was he truly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThere he sat, unconscious of the daylight. On a chair at his side lay a\r\nviolin and a flute; near them, a violoncello leaned against the wall and\r\nwithin reach of his hand stood one of those upright pianos just then\r\ncoming into fashion.\r\n\r\nAt one moment he wrote rapidly, at another he hummed a melody; again,\r\nhalf declaiming, half singing, he read off a recitative; and then bent\r\nover and wrote with all his might. The light began to smoke, and the wax\r\ndropped over his music, but he saw none of it; neither saw he the\r\ndaylight that had replaced his candles. He was so absorbed in his work\r\nas not to hear a knock at his door.\r\n\r\nBut now the knock was repeated; and this time so distinctly that it\r\nwaked him from his dream of harmony, and he frowned. He rose, and\r\nstriding to the door, withdrew the bolt.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and a tall, elegant woman, in a tasteful morning-dress\r\ncame in. Her fine, regular features were disturbed, and her eyes were\r\nred with weeping or watching. When she saw Gluck looking so fresh and\r\nvigorous, she smiled, and said, \"Heaven be praised, you are alive and\r\nwell! I have passed a night of anxious terror on your account.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why, Marianne?\" asked he, his brow unbent, and his face beaming\r\nwith tenderness; for Gluck idolized his beautiful wife.\r\n\r\nShe looked at his quiet, inquiring face, and broke into a merry laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the barbarian,\" cried she, \"not to know of what he has been guilty\r\nof! Why, Christopher, look at those burnt-out wax lights--look at the\r\ndaylight wondering at you through your curtains. Last night, at ten\r\no'clock, I lit these candles, and you promised to work for only two\r\nhours more. Look at them now, and see what you have been doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, I do believe that I have been here all night,\" said Gluck, with\r\nnaive astonishment. \"But I assure you, Marianne, that I fully intended\r\nto go to bed at the end of two hours. Is it my fault if the night has\r\nseemed so short? Twelve hours since we parted? Can it be?\"\r\n\r\nHe went to the window and drew the curtains. \"Day!\" cried he, \"and the\r\nsun so bright!\" He looked out with a smile; but suddenly his brow grew\r\nthoughtful, and he said in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, may the light of day shine upon me also!\"\r\n\r\nHis wife laid her hand upon his arm. \"And upon whom falls the light of\r\nday, if not upon you?\" asked she, reproachfully. \"Look back upon your\r\ntwenty operas, and see each one bearing its laurel-wreath, and shouting\r\nto the world your fame! And now look into the future, and see their\r\nunborn sisters, whose lips one day will open to the harmony of your\r\nmusic, and will teach all nations to love your memory! And I,\r\nChristopher, I believe more in your future than in your past successes.\r\nIf I did not, think you that I would indulge you as I do in your\r\nartistic eccentricities, and sit like a lovelorn maiden outside of this\r\ndoor, my ear strained to listen for your breathing--dreading lest some\r\nsudden stroke should have quenched the light of that genius which you\r\novertask--yet daring not to ask entrance, lest my presence should\r\naffright your other loves, the Muses? Yes, my dear husband, I have faith\r\nin the power of your genius; and for you this glorious sun has risen\r\nto-day. Chase those clouds from the heaven of your brow. They are\r\nill-timed.\"\r\n\r\nIn the height of her enthusiasm she twined her arms around his neck, and\r\nrested her head upon Gluck's bosom.\r\n\r\nHe bent down and kissed her forehead. \"Then, my wife has faith, not in\r\nwhat I have done, but in what I can do? Is it so, love?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, Christopher. I believe in the power of your genius.\"\r\n\r\nGluck's face wore an expression of triumph as she said this, and he\r\nsmiled. His smile was very beautiful, and ever, when she saw it, his\r\nwife felt a thrill of happiness. Never had it seemed to her so full of\r\nheavenly inspiration.\r\n\r\n\"Since such is your faith in me, my Egeria, you will then have courage\r\nto hear what I have to tell. Tear away the laurel-wreaths from my past\r\nworks, Marianne--burn them to ashes. They are dust and to dust they will\r\nsurely return. Their mirth and their melody, their pomp and their\r\npathos, are all lies. They are not the true children of\r\ninspiration--they are impostors. They are the offspring of our affected\r\nand falsely sentimental times, and deserve not immortality. Away with\r\nthem! A new day shall begin for me, or I shall hide my head in bitter\r\nsolitude, despising my race, who applaud the juggler, and turn away in\r\ncoldness from the veritable artiste.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed Marianne, \"those far-famed operas that delight the\r\nworld--are they nothing more than clever deceptions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing more,\" cried Gluck. \"They did not gush from the holy fount of\r\ninspiration; they were composed and arranged to suit the taste of the\r\npublic and the dexterity of the singers, who, if they trill and juggle\r\nwith their voices, think that they have reached the summit of musical\r\nperfection. But this must no longer be. I have written for time, I shall\r\nnow work for immortality. Let me interpret what the angels have\r\nwhispered, and then you shall hear a language which nothing but music\r\ncan translate. What are the lame efforts of speech by the side of its\r\nthrilling tones? Music is a divine revelation, but men have not yet\r\nreceived it in their hearts. I have been made its messenger, and I shall\r\nspeak the message faithfully.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Christopher,\" interposed Marianne, \"I fear you will find no\r\nfollowers. If the message be too lofty for the hearers, the messenger\r\nwill be driven away in disgrace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear the coward!\" cried Gluck vehemently; \"see the woman's nature\r\nshrinking from the path of honor because it is beset with danger. I did\r\nwell not to let you know the nature of my last labors, for with your\r\nsighs and croakings you would have turned me back again into the highway\r\nof falsehood. But you are too late, poltroon. The work is done, and it\r\nshall see light.\" Gluck looked at his wife's face, and the expression he\r\nsaw there made him pause. He was already sorry, and ready to atone. \"No,\r\nno! I wrong you, my Egeria: not only are you the wife of my love, but\r\nthe friend of my genius. Come, dearest, let us brave the world together;\r\nand even if that fail us, let us never doubt the might of truth and the\r\nglory of its interpreters.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Gluck reached out his hands; and his wife, with a trusting\r\nsmile laid both hers upon them. \"How can you doubt me, Christopher?\"\r\nasked she. \"Look back into the past, to the days of our courtship, and\r\nsay then who was faint-hearted, and who then declared that his little\r\nweight of grief was too heavy for those broad shoulders to bear.\"\r\n\r\n\"I! I!\" confessed Gluck; \"but I was in love, and a man in love is always\r\na craven.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I suppose,\" laughed Marianne, \"that I was not in love, which will\r\naccount for my energy and patience on that occasion. To think that my\r\nrich father thought me too good for Gluck!--Heaven forgive me but I\r\ncould not mourn him as I might have done, had his death not left me free\r\nto marry you, you ill-natured giant. Yes! and now that twelve years have\r\ngone by, I love you twice as well as I did; and God, who knew there was\r\nno room in my heart for other loves, has given me no children, for I\r\nlong for none. You are to me husband, lover, friend, and--you need not\r\nshake your head, sir--you are child, too. Then why have you kept your\r\nsecrets from me--tell me, traitor, why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not because you were faint-hearted, my beloved,\" said Gluck with\r\nemotion; \"my violent temper wronged us both, when it provoked me to\r\nutter a word so false. But genius must labor in secret and in silence;\r\nits works are like those enchanted treasures of which we have\r\nread--speak of their existence, and lo! they are ashes, Sometimes genius\r\nholds an enchanted treasure before the eyes of the artiste, who in holy\r\nmeditation must earn it for himself. One word spoken breaketh the spell,\r\nand therefore it was, Marianne, that I spoke not the word. But the\r\ntreasure is mine; I have earned it, and at my wife's feet I lay it,\r\nperchance that she may stand by my side, while the world rejects it as\r\nworthless, and heaps obloquy upon my head.\"\r\n\r\n\"His will be a bold hand that casts the first stone at the giant!\" said\r\nMarianne, looking proudly upon the tall and stalwart figure of her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n\"You call me giant, and that recalls to me a fact which bears upon the\r\nsubject of our conversation now,\" said Gluck, with a laugh. \"It was the\r\nfall of my 'Giant' that first showed me the precipice toward which I, my\r\nworks, and all my musical predecessors, were hastening.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean your 'Cuduta de Giganti,' which you tried to exhibit before\r\nthose icy English people?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not speak against the English, Marianne; they are a good, upright\r\nnation. It is not their fault if they are better versed in bookkeeping\r\nthan in music; and I do not know that they are far wrong when they\r\nprefer the chink of gold to the strumming and piping which, until now,\r\nthe world, turning up the whites of its eyes, has called music. I, who\r\nhad been piping and strumming with the rest, suddenly rushed out of the\r\nthrong, and thrusting my masterpiece in their faces, told them that it\r\nwas music. Was it their fault if they turned their backs and would not\r\nbelieve me? I think not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh I you need not excuse the English, Christopher. I know the history\r\nof the 'Cuduta de Giganti,' although Master Gluck has never told it me.\r\nI know that the young artist met with no favor at English hands; and I\r\nknow that because his works were not a lame repetition of Italian music\r\nand water, the discerning Londoners voted it worthless. I know, too,\r\nthat Master Gluck, in his distress, took counsel with the great Handel,\r\nand besought him to point out the opera's defects. Then said Handel--\"\r\n\r\n\"How, dear prattler, you know what Handel said?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do, Master Gluck. Handel said: 'You have given yourself too much\r\ntrouble, man. To please the English public you must make a great noise.\r\nGive them plenty of brass and sheep-skin.'\"\r\n\r\n\"So he did,\" cried Gluck, convulsed with laughter. \"I followed his\r\nadvice. I sprinkled the choruses with trumpet and drum, and the second\r\ntime the opera came out it was a complete success.\"\r\n\r\nMarianne joined in the mirth of her husband.\r\n\r\n\"But now, if all this is true, why do you like the English?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because my failure in England taught me the utter worthlessness of our\r\npresent school of music, and inspired me with the desire to reform it.\"\r\n\r\nHe drew her arm within his, and seated her on the divan by his side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW OPERA.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Marianne,\" said he, putting his arm around her waist, \"hear the\r\nsecret history of my musical career. I will tell you of the misfortunes\r\nwhich my genius has encountered through life. I begin with England. It\r\nis of no use to go back to the privations of my boyhood, though they\r\nwere many; for hunger and thirst are the tribute that man must pay to\r\nfate for the capital which genius gives to him, and which he must\r\nincrease with all his might and all his strength. Even as a boy I craved\r\nless for bread than for fame; and I consecrated my life and soul to art.\r\nI thought that I was in the right way, for I had written eight operas,\r\nwhich the Italians lauded to the skies. But the 'Caduta de Giganti' was\r\na failure, and 'Artamene' likewise. This double fiasco enraged me (you\r\nknow my bad temper, Marianne). I could not bear to be so misconceived. I\r\nwas determined to show the English that, in spite of them, I was an\r\nartiste. I longed to bring them to my feet, as Jupiter did the Titans.\r\nSo I ordered from one of those poetasters to be found in every land, a\r\nsort of libretto called, in theatrical parlance, a lyric drama; and to\r\nthe words of this monstrosity I arranged the very finest airs of my\r\nseveral operas. When I had completed this musical kaleidoscope I called\r\nit 'Pyramus and Thisbe.' I dished up my olla podrida, and set it before\r\nthe hungry English; but they did not relish it. The public remained\r\ncold, and, what was far worse, I remained cold myself. I thought over\r\nthis singular result, and wondered how it was that music which, as a\r\npart of the operas for which it was written, had seemed so full of soul,\r\nnow faded into insipidity when transplanted to the soil of other\r\ndramatic situations. I found the answer in the question. It was because\r\nI had transplanted my music from its native soil, that its beauty had\r\nflown. Then it burst upon my mind that the libretto is the father of the\r\nopera, the music its mother; and so, if the father be not strong and\r\nlusty, the mother will bring forth a sickly offspring, which offspring\r\ncannot grow up to perfection. Now, my operas are sickly, for they are\r\nthe children of an unsound father, who is no true poet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, still, rash man!\" whispered Marianne, looking around as though\r\nshe feared listeners. \"Do you forget that the father of your operas is\r\nMetastasio?\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember it too well; for many of my works have perished from their\r\nunion with his weak and sentimental verses. Perished, in MY estimation,\r\nI mean; for to make my operas passable, I have often been obliged to\r\nwrite fiery music to insipid words; and introduce fioritures out of\r\nplace, that the nightingales might compensate to the world for the\r\nshortcomings of the poet. Well, my heart has bled while I wrote such\r\nmusic, and I prayed to God to send me a true poet--one who could write\r\nof something else besides love; one, who could rise to the height of my\r\nown inspiration, and who could develop a genuine lyric drama, with\r\ncharacters, not personages, and a plot whose interest should increase\r\nunto its end.\"\r\n\r\n\"And have you found him?\" asked Marianne, with a meaning smile. \"I have.\r\nIt is-\"\r\n\r\n\"Calzabigi,\" interrupted she.\r\n\r\n\"How!\" cried the fiery Gluck, \"after promising secrecy, has he been\r\nunable to curb his tongue?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, Christopher! he has not said a word to me. I guessed this\r\nlong ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how comes it that you never hinted a word of it to ME?\"\r\n\r\n\"I waited for the hour when you deemed it best to speak, my love; for I\r\nfully comprehend the reasons for your silence. I waited therefore until\r\nMinerva should come forth, full armed, to challenge Jove's opponents to\r\nthe strife. Meanwhile I had faith in God and thee, Christopher, and I\r\nprayed for Heaven's blessing on thy genius.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven will hear thy prayer, my better self,\" cried Gluck, drawing his\r\nwife close to his heart. \"Oh, how happy I feel to be permitted to speak\r\nwith thee of my past labors! How gladly shall I listen to thy criticisms\r\nor thy approval! both, more to me than those of all the world beside.\r\nCome, Marianne, I will begin now.\"\r\n\r\nHe sprang up from the divan, and would have hurried to the piano, but\r\nMarianne held him back. \"Maestro,\" said she, \"before we sacrifice to\r\nApollo, let us give to life and mortality their rights. Prose awaits us\r\nin the dining-room, and we shall give her audience before we open the\r\npages of this nameless opera.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall hear its name, Marianne. It is--\"\r\n\r\nMarianne put her arms around his neck, and whispered, \"Hush, my Orpheus!\"\r\n\r\n\"How! You know that also?\"\r\n\r\nShe raised her hand, as if in menace. \"Know, Christopher, that little\r\nHymen tolerates no man who has secrets from his wife. You tried to be\r\nsilent, but betrayed yourself in your sleep. You do not know how often\r\nduring the night you have called Eurydice in tones of plaintive music.\r\nNor do you know how, as you appealed to the deities of the infernal\r\nregions, I shuddered at the power of your weird notes!\"\r\n\r\n\"You heard, then,\" cried Cluck, enchanted. \"And you--\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend Prose, Prose calls with angry voice. Away to the dining-room!\r\nA man who has revelled all night with the Muses, needs refreshment in\r\nthe morning. Nay--you need not frown like Jupiter Tonans--you must go\r\nwith me to eat earthly food, before I taste your nectar and ambrosia.\r\nCome, and to reward your industry you shall have a glass of Lacrimae\r\nChristi from the cellar of the Duke of Bologna.\"\r\n\r\nShe drew him from the room, and succeeded in landing him at the\r\nbreakfast-table.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I will not hear a word about art,\" said Marianne, when the\r\nservants had brought in the breakfast. \"I am the physician, both of body\r\nand mind, and condemn you to a silence of fifteen minutes. Then you may\r\ntalk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of my opera, carissima?\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven forbid! of the wind and weather--nothing else. Now hush, and\r\ndrink your chocolate.\"\r\n\r\nSo Gluck, obedient, drank his chocolate, and ate his biscuit and\r\npartridge-wing in silence.\r\n\r\nAll at once, the comfortable stillness was broken by a loud ringing of\r\nthe door-bell, and a servant announced Signor Calzabigi.\r\n\r\nGluck darted off from the table, but Marianne, laughing, brought him\r\nback again. \"First, your glass of Lacrimae Christi,\" said she.\r\n\"Calzabigi will be indulgent and wait for us a moment.\"\r\n\r\nHe took the glass, and inclining his head, drank her health.\r\n\r\n\"Marianne,\" said he cheerfully, \"I have been amiable and tractable as a\r\ngood child. Enough of Prose, then--give me my freedom now, will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, maestro; you are free; your body is refreshed, and can bear the\r\nweight of that strong soul that has no infirmities to impede its flight.\r\nFly, if you list--to Calzabigi!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nRANIER VON CALZABIGI.\r\n\r\nThe door of the drawing-room bad scarcely opened before Calzabigi\r\nhastened forward to meet Gluck. But, seeing his wife, he stopped, and\r\nmade a profound inclination.\r\n\r\n\"Speak out, friend,\" cried Gluck merrily. \"She knows every thing, and\r\nthink what a treasure of a wife she is! She has known it all along,\r\nwithout betraying herself by a word.\"\r\n\r\n\"And does that surprise you?\" answered Calzabigi, \"It does not me, for\r\nwell I know that the signora is an angel of prudence as well as of\r\ngoodness. The signora will allow me to speak before her? Well, then,\r\nmaestro, the die is cast. I am just from the house of Count Durazzo, to\r\nwhom, at your request, I took the opera yesterday. The count sat up all\r\nnight to examine it; and this morning, when I was ushered into his room,\r\nI found him still in his evening-dress, the score on the table before\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear, Marianne,\" exclaimed Gluck, triumphantly, \"it is not only the\r\ncomposer who forgets to sleep for the sake of this opera. And what said\r\nthe theatrical director, Raniero?\"\r\n\r\n\"He said that no intrigue and no opposition should prevent him from\r\nrepresenting this magnificent opera. He says that he feels proud of the\r\nprivilege of introducing such a chef-d'oeuvre to the world. He has\r\nalready sent for the transcribers; he has chosen the performers, and\r\nbegs of the author to distribute the parts. But every thing must be done\r\nat once, for the opera comes out in October to celebrate the birthday of\r\nthe young Archduchess Isabella.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is impossible,\" cried Gluck. \"We are in July, and such an opera\r\ncannot be learned in three months.\"\r\n\r\n\"With good-will, it can be done, Christopher,\" said Marianne,\r\nimploringly. \"Do not leave your enemies time to cabal against you;\r\nsnatch the victory from them before they have time for strategy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not know what you require at my hands,\" returned he,\r\npassionately. \"You do not know how an ill-timed pause or a slighted rest\r\nwould mar the fair face of my godlike music, and travesty its beauty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear how he defames himself!\" laughed Marianne, \"as if it were so easy\r\nto desecrate Gluck's masterpiece.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is precisely because it is my masterpiece that it is easy to\r\ntravesty,\" returned Gluck, earnestly. \"The lines which distinguish the\r\nhand of a Raphael from that of a lesser genius are so delicate as to be\r\nalmost imperceptible. Slight deviations of the pencil have no effect\r\nupon a caricature; but you well know how completely a beautiful face\r\nmaybe disfigured by a few unskilful touches. I will cite as an example\r\nthe aria of 'Orpheus,' 'Che faro senza Euridice' Change its expression\r\nby the smallest discrepancy of time or modulation, and you transform it\r\ninto a tune for a puppet-show. In music of this description a misplaced\r\npiano or forte, an ill-judged fioriture, an error of movement, either\r\none, will alter the effect of the whole scene. The opera must,\r\ntherefore, be rehearsed under my own direction, for the composer is the\r\nsoul of his opera, and his presence is as necessary to its success as is\r\nthat of the sun to the creation.\" [Footnote: These are Gluck's own\r\nwords. Anton Schmid, \"Life of Gluck,\" page 152.]\r\n\r\n\"Well, I am sure, you can manage the whole troupe with that stentor\r\nvoice of yours,\" replied Marianne.\r\n\r\n\"If you do not consent, Gluck,\" interposed Calzabigi, \"they will have to\r\nrehearse for the birthday fete an opera of Hasse and Metastasio.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" shrieked Gluck, \"lay aside my 'Orpheus' for one of Hasse's puny\r\noperas? Never! My opera is almost complete. It needs but one last aria\r\nto stand out before the world in all its fulness of perfection, and\r\nshall I suffer it to be laid aside to give place to one of his tooting,\r\njingling performances? No, no. My 'Orpheus' shall not retire before\r\nHasse's pitiful jeremiades. It shall be forthcoming on the birthday, and\r\nI must train the singers by day and by night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right!\" exclaimed Marianne, \"and we shall crown you with new laurels,\r\nChristopher, on that eventful night.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not so sure of that, Marianne. It is easier to criticise than to\r\nappreciate, and every thing original or new provokes the opposition of\r\nthe multitude. In our case, they have double provocation, for\r\nCalzabigi's poem is as original as my music. We have both striven for\r\nsimplicity, nature, and truth; we have both discarded clap-trap of every\r\nsort. Oh, Calzabigi, my friend, how happy for me that I have found such\r\na poet! If, through his 'Orpheus,' Gluck is to attain fame, he well\r\nknows how much of it is due to the inspiration of your noble poem.\"\r\n\r\n\"And never,\" exclaimed Calzabigi, grasping the extended hand of the\r\ncomposer, \"never would the name of poor Calzabigi have been known, had\r\nGluck not borne it along upon the pinions of his own fame. If the world\r\ncalls me poet, it is because my poem has borrowed beauty from Gluck's\r\ncelestial music.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Gluck, laughing, \"and if your poem fails, you will be\r\nequally indebted to Gluck's music. Those half-learned critics, so\r\nnumerous in the world, who are far more injurious to art than the\r\nignorant, will rave against our opera. Another class of musical pedants\r\nwill be for discovering carelessness, and, for aught we know, the\r\nmajority of the world may follow in their wake, and condemn our opera as\r\nbarbarous, discordant, and overstrained.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must try to forestall all these prejudices, and win the critics to\r\nthe side of truth and real art,\" said Marianne.\r\n\r\n\"The signora is right,\" said Calzabigi. \"It is not so much for our own\r\nsake, as for the sake of art, that we should strive to have a fair\r\nhearing before the world. We have the powerful party of Metastasio and\r\nHasse to gain. But I will deal with them myself. You, maestro, speak a\r\nword of encouragement to Hasse, and he will be so overjoyed, that he\r\nwill laud your opera to the skies. And pray, be a man among men, and do\r\nas other composers have done before: pay a visit to the singers, and ask\r\nthem to bring all their skill to the representation of your great work;\r\nask them to--\"\r\n\r\nHere, Gluck, boiling over with indignation, broke in upon Calzabigi, so\r\nas actually to make the poet start back.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" cried he, in a voice of thunder, \"shall I visit the ladies'\r\nmaids also, and make them declarations of love? Shall I present each\r\nsinger with a golden snuff-box, while I entertain the troupe at a\r\nsupper, where champagne shall flow like water, and Indian birds-nests\r\nshall be served up with diamonds? Shall I present myself in full\r\ncourt-dress at the anteroom of the tenor, and, slipping a ducat in the\r\nhand of his valet, solicit the honor of an interview? Shall I then bribe\r\nthe maid of the prima donna to let me lay upon her mistress's\r\ntoilet-table a poem, a dedication, and a set of jewels? Shame upon you,\r\ncravens, that would have genius beg for suffrages from mediocrity!\r\nRather would I throw my 'Orpheus' behind the fire, and let every opera I\r\nhave ever written follow it to destruction. I would bite out my tongue,\r\nand spit it in Hasse's face, sooner than go before him with a mouth full\r\nof flattering lies, to befool him with praise of that patchwork he has\r\nmade, and calls AN OPERA! When I was obscure and unknown, I scorned\r\nthese tricks of trade; and think you that to-day I would stoop to such\r\nbaseness? Eight years ago, in Rome, a cabal was formed to cause the\r\nfailure of my 'Trionfo de Camillo,' Cardinal Albini came to assure me\r\nthat his influence should put down the plots of my enemies. I thanked\r\nhim, but refused all protection for my opera: and I told his eminence\r\nthat my works must depend upon their own worth for success. [Footnote:\r\nThis is true. Anton Schmid, page 88.] And you dare, at this time, to\r\ncome with such proposals to me? You are not worthy of my friendship. I\r\nwill have nothing further to say to either of you, you cringing\r\npuppets!\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, with his dark-blue dressing-gown flying out like an angry\r\ncloud behind him, Gluck strode across the room, and sailed off to his\r\nprivate study.\r\n\r\nMarianne, smiling, reached out her hand to the astounded poet. \"Forgive\r\nhis stormy temper,\" said she, gently; \"he can no more bear contradiction\r\nthan a spoiled child. His wrath looks formidable; but though there is\r\nmuch thunder, there is no lightning about him. Wait a quarter of an\r\nhour, kind friend, and he will be back, suing for pardon and imploring\r\nus to take his hand, just like a naughty child that he is. Then he will\r\nsmile, and look so ashamed that you will never have the heart to feel\r\nresentful.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have none already,\" replied Calzabigi; \"his thunder has rolled\r\ngrandly over our heads, and right noble are its sounds; but the\r\nlightning has spared us. We are safe, and--unconvinced. For, indeed,\r\nsignora,\" continued Raniero, with earnestness, \"we are right. No\r\nreliance is ever to be placed upon the justice or good taste of the\r\nworld, and since the maestro refuses to propitiate his judges; I will\r\nundertake the task myself. I shall go at once to Metastasio, and after\r\nthat I shall invite the performers to a supper.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE BIRTHDAY.\r\n\r\nIt was the birthday of the Archduchess Isabella, and all Vienna was\r\nalive with festivity. The passionate love of the archduke for his\r\nbeautiful young wife was well known, and the people hastened to offer\r\nhomage to the beloved partner of their future emperor.\r\n\r\nFrom early morning the equipages of the nobility were seen hurrying to\r\nthe palace, where the archduchess in state, surrounded by the other\r\nmembers of the imperial family, received the congratulations of the\r\ncourt. In an adjoining room, on a table of white marble, were exhibited\r\nthe rich gifts by which her new relatives had testified their affection;\r\nfor Isabella was adored by her husband's family.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Francis, usually so simple, had presented her with a set of\r\njewels, worth half a million; and the empress, whose joy in the\r\nhappiness of her son's wedded life knew no bounds, was lavish in her\r\ndemonstrations of love to the woman who had awakened his heart to gentle\r\nemotions.\r\n\r\nNot only had every variety of rich costumes been ordered for Isabella\r\nfrom Paris, but the empress had gone so far as to present a set of\r\nbridal jewels to her little grand-daughter, a child scarcely a year old.\r\nThis magnificent parure of diamonds, sapphires, and pearls, was the\r\nadmiration of the whole court. Around it lay the offerings of the young\r\nsisters-in-law, all of whom, with one exception, had presented\r\nsomething. The Princess Christina, the dearest friend of Isabella, had\r\npainted her miniature, and this beautiful likeness was intended as a\r\npresent to the Archduke Joseph. [Footnote: Wraxall, page 80.] He\r\nreceived it with delight; and while his large blue eyes wandered from\r\nthe portrait to the original, he testified his pleasure by every\r\npossible expression of rapture and gratitude. \"And yet,\" said he, \"there\r\nis something in this picture which I have never seen in your\r\ncountenance, Isabella. Your eyes, which to me have always seemed to\r\nborrow their light from heaven, here look dark and unfathomable, as if\r\nwithin their melancholy depths there lay a secret full of untold\r\nsorrow.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph did not perceive the look of intelligence that passed between his\r\nwife and sister as he spoke these words: he still gazed upon the\r\npicture, and at last his face, which had been lit up with joy, grew\r\nsorrowful and full of thought. Suddenly he laid the miniature down, and\r\nplacing his hands upon Isabella's shoulders, he looked searchingly at\r\nher pale countenance.\r\n\r\n\"Look at me, my beloved,\" whispered he, tenderly, \"let me see your\r\nbewitching smile, that it may give the lie to yonder strange image. I\r\nsee there your beautiful features, but instead of my loving and beloved\r\nwife, my happy, smiling Isabella, I see an angel, but, oh, I see a\r\nmartyr, too, dying of some secret sorrow. That is not your face--is it\r\nmy wife? YOU have never looked so wretched, so heart-broken! Speak,\r\nIsabella, you are happy, are you not, my own one?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear husband,\" whispered she, scarcely moving her blanched lips,\r\n\"I am happy and contented in your happiness, But see, the empress\r\nbeckons to you. She seems about to present some stranger to your\r\nnotice.\"\r\n\r\nThe archduke left to obey the summons, and Isabella and Christina\r\nremained together, looking vacantly upon the birthday-table and the\r\nsplendid gifts that lay in such rich profusion before their eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Poor brother!\" murmured Christina, \"he loves as few have ever loved\r\nbefore! And you, dear sister, can you not kindle one spark from the\r\nembers of your heart to warm--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why speak of my dead heart?\" said Isabella, mournfully. \"Did I not long\r\nago confide to you its terrible secret? You, my trusted and dearest\r\nfriend, have you not seen how I pray Heaven for strength to hold before\r\nmy husband's eyes the faint ray of light which he mistakes for the\r\nsunshine of love? Dear Joseph! His heart is so noble and so rich with\r\nlove that he sees not the poverty of mine. May God be merciful that his\r\ndelusion last at least as long as my life! then will I die happy; for I\r\nshall have done my duty in the face of a sorrow transcending all other\r\nsorrows.\"\r\n\r\nChristina bent her head over the glittering heaps before her, that no\r\none might see her tears. But Isabella saw them as they fell upon the\r\nbridal gifts of her little daughter.\r\n\r\nShe pointed to the jewels. \"See, Christina, your tears are brighter than\r\nour dear mother's diamonds. Now, were the emperor here--\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven forbid!\" said Christina, as with her gossamer handkerchief she\r\nwiped away the fallen tear. \"If the empress were to know this, she would\r\nbe justly displeased, that, on such a day, my tears should dim the\r\nsplendor of your little daughter's bridal jewels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give yourself no concern for my daughter's jewels, Christina; she will\r\nnever see her bridal-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"How? Do you expect her to be an old maid, like my two eldest sisters?\"\r\nasked Christina, with assumed playfulness.\r\n\r\nIsabella laid her hand on Christina's shoulder. \"I believe,\" said she,\r\nsolemnly, \"or rather I know, that my daughter will ere long be an\r\nangel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Isabella,\" cried Christina, almost impatiently, \"is it not enough\r\nthat you prophesy your own death, to make me wretched, without adding to\r\nmy grief by predicting that of your child, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot leave her behind, Christina; I should be unhappy without her.\r\nShe must follow me--but hush! Here comes the empress --let us be happy\r\nfor her sake.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with a sweet smile, Isabella advanced to greet her mother-in-law.\r\n\r\n\"My dearest daughter,\" said the empress, \"I long for this ceremonial to\r\nend, that we may enjoy our happiness en famille. We must dine in\r\nprivate, unless you wish it otherwise, for to-day you are empress of all\r\nhearts, and your wishes are commands.\"\r\n\r\nIsabella raised the hand of the empress to her lips. \"I have but one\r\nwish to-day, your majesty,\" said she; \"it is that you love me.\"\r\n\r\n\"That wish was granted before it was uttered, my beloved child,\" replied\r\nthe empress, tenderly, \"for indeed I love you more and more each day of\r\nmy life; and when I see you and my son together, your happiness seems\r\nlike the old melody of my own happy bridal so many years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" said Isabella, \"your majesty looks so young--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, child, I am a grandmother,\" replied the empress, smiling proudly,\r\n\"but my heart is as young as ever, and it leaps with joy when I look\r\nupon the son whom you have made so happy. Why, HIS heart looks out of\r\nhis great, blue eyes with such--But see for yourself, here he comes!\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the archduke entered the room, and advanced toward his\r\nmother, while at the door, apparently awaiting his return, stood the\r\nemperor and the lord high chancellor, Kaunitz.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your majesty, if I interrupt you,\" said the archduke. \"I\r\nhave just learned from the marshal of the imperial household that your\r\nmajesty has declined going to the opera to-night. Can this be possible,\r\nwhen Gluck's new opera has been rehearsing for two months with especial\r\nreference to this occasion?\"\r\n\r\n\"It can,\" replied the empress, \"for I do not interdict the\r\nrepresentation--I only absent myself from it.\"\r\n\r\nThe archduke crimsoned, and he was about to make some hasty reply, when\r\nhe felt the pressure of his wife's hand upon his arm. He smiled, and\r\ncontrolled himself at once.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me, if I venture to remonstrate with your majesty,\" replied he,\r\ngood-humoredly. \"This new opera of Gluck is a musical gem, and is well\r\nworthy your majesty's notice.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been told, on the contrary, that it is very tiresome,\" exclaimed\r\nthe empress with impatience. \"The libretto is heavy, and the music also.\r\nIt is highly probable that the opera will fail, and it would certainly\r\nbe unfortunate if, on this day of rejoicing, we should assemble there to\r\nwitness the failure.\"\r\n\r\n\"But your majesty may have been misinformed,\" persisted Joseph. \"Let me\r\nbeg of you, my dear mother, for the sake of the great maestro, who would\r\ntake your absence sorely to heart, as well as for the sake of the\r\ndirector, Count Durazzo, who has taken such pains to produce this new\r\nmasterpiece--let me beg you to reconsider your decision.\"\r\n\r\n\"And allow me to add my entreaties to those of Joseph,\" said the\r\nemperor; entering the room. \"All Vienna awaits the new representation as\r\na high artistic gratification. Without your majesty's presence the\r\ntriumph of the maestro will be incomplete.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the emperor, too, opposes me?\" said Maria Theresa. \"Does he, too,\r\ndesert the old style, to follow these new-fangled musical\r\neccentricities? Have we not all enjoyed the opera as it exists at\r\npresent? And if so, why shall this Master Gluck step suddenly forward\r\nand announce to us that we know nothing of music, and that what we have\r\nhitherto admired as such was nothing more than trumpery? Why does he\r\ndisdain the poetry of Metastasio, to adopt that of a man whom nobody\r\nknows? I will not lend my hand to mortify the old man who for thirty\r\nyears has been our court-poet. I owe it to him, at least, not to appear\r\nat this representation, and that is reason enough for me to refuse my\r\npresence there.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Calzabigi's poem is of surpassing beauty,\" remonstrated the\r\nemperor; \"for Kaunitz himself has seen it, and is in raptures with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Kaunitz, too, has given his adherence to the new musical caprice of\r\nMaster Gluck?\" said the empress, signing to the count to come forward.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty,\" said Kaunitz, bowing, \"I also am for the new and\r\nstartling, whether in politics or in music. I have learned this lesson\r\nfrom my imperial mistress, whose new line of policy now commands the\r\nadmiration of all Europe.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress received these flattering words with an emotion of visible\r\npleasure; for it was seldom that Kaunitz paid compliments, even to\r\nsovereigns.\r\n\r\n\"You mean, then, that Gluck has not only produced something new, but\r\nsomething of worth, also?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty, music has cut off her queue, and really in her new\r\ncoiffure she is divinely beautiful. Moreover, your majesty has rewarded\r\nthe seventy years of Metastasio with a rich pension, proof enough to him\r\nof the estimation in which his talents are held. Metastasio belongs to\r\nthe old regime you have pensioned off; Calzabigi and Gluck are children\r\nof our new Austria. Your majesty's self has created this Austria, and\r\nyou owe to her children your imperial countenance and favor.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have been told there will be some strife to-night between the\r\nrival parties,\" said the empress.\r\n\r\n\"And since when has your majesty shunned the battle-field?\" asked\r\nKaunitz.\r\n\r\n\"But the defeat, count, I fear the defeat. The opera is sure to fail.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one knows better than your majesty how to console the vanquished.\r\nYour majesty was never greater than when, after the defeat of\r\nField-marshal Daun, you went forth to meet him with all the honors which\r\nyou would have awarded to a victorious general. [Footnote: After the\r\nbattle of Torgau, which Daun lost.] If Gluck fails to-day, he will not\r\nbe the less a great artiste, and your majesty will sustain him under his\r\nreverses.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress laughed. \"It is dangerous to contend with Kaunitz, for he\r\nslays me with my own weapons. And you, too, my husband, would have me\r\nabandon Hasse and Metastasio, who are so pious and so good, for this\r\nGluck, whom I have never met inside of a church? Gluck is not even a\r\nChristian.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he is a genius,\" cried out Joseph, \"and genius is pleasing in the\r\nsight of God. Metastasio and Hasse are old, and having nothing better to\r\ndo, they go to church. If they were young, your majesty would not meet\r\nthem so often, I fancy.\"\r\n\r\nThe face of the empress grew scarlet while the archduke poured forth\r\nthese thoughtless words; and all present felt that Gluck and his cause\r\nwere lost.\r\n\r\nBut Isabella came to the rescue. Approaching the empress and kissing her\r\nhand, she said: \"Your majesty has been so good as to say that to-day you\r\nwould refuse me nothing. I have two requests to make. May I speak?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear child, you may,\" replied the empress, already appeased by the\r\ngentle voice of her beloved daughter-in-law. \"I know so well that you\r\nwill ask nothing unseemly that I do not fear to grant your requests.\r\nWhat are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"First, your majesty, I beg that my husband and I be permitted to attend\r\nthe mass that is to be celebrated in your private chapel, that by your\r\nside we may beg of God to give peace to Austria, and to bless us, your\r\nmajesty's own family, with unity and love among ourselves. Will you\r\npermit this?\"\r\n\r\nThe empress, in her animated way, drew the archduchess toward her, and\r\nkissed her tenderly.\r\n\r\n\"You are an angel, Isabella,\" said she, \"and discord ceases at the very\r\nsound of your voice. Yes, dearest child, you shall come with Joseph; and\r\nside by side we will pray for peace and family concord. For the second\r\nboon, I guess it. Is it not that I grant your husband's petition?\"\r\n\r\nIsabella, smiling, bowed her head, and the empress turned toward the\r\nemperor.\r\n\r\n\"Well, your majesty,\" continued she, \"since my presence is\r\nindispensable, I bow to your superior judgment in art, and the court\r\nmust attend the opera to-night. Are you satisfied, my son?\" asked she of\r\nthe archduke. \"Are you satisfied now that I have sacrificed my\r\nprejudices to give you pleasure? And on some future occasion will you do\r\nas much for me, should I require it?\"\r\n\r\n\"With shame I shall remember your majesty's goodness in pardoning my\r\nungracious behavior to-day\" replied the archduke, fervently pressing his\r\nmother's hands to his lips.\r\n\r\n\"I not only forgive but forget it, my son,\" said Maria Theresa, with one\r\nof her enchanting smiles; \"this is a day of rejoicing, and no clouds\r\nshall darken our happiness. Let us now retire to the chapel, for,\r\nbelieve me, dear son, it is not well to forget our heavenly Father until\r\nage forces us to remember our dependence. A great and brilliant destiny\r\nis before you, Joseph, and much you need help from Heaven. Watch and\r\npray while you are young, that you may call down the blessing of God\r\nupon your career.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nORPHEUS AND EURYDICE.\r\n\r\nOn that night, all Vienna sped to the Imperial Opera-house. Not lords\r\nand ladies alone, but commoners and artisans with their wives, thronged\r\nto hear the wonderful music which for three weeks had divided the\r\nViennese into two bitter factions. On one side stood Metastasio, the\r\nvenerable court-poet, whose laurels dated from the reign of the\r\nempress's father. Linked with his fame was that of Hasse, who for forty\r\nyears had been called \"Il caro Sassone\" Hasse, who had composed so many\r\noperas, was often heard to say, that, when it came upon him unawares, he\r\ndid not know his own music.\r\n\r\nAll Italy had declared for Hasse and Metastasio, and in scornful\r\nsecurity the Italians had predicted the discomfiture of the new school\r\nof music.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand were Gluck and his friend Calzabigi, whose partisans\r\ndisdained the old style, and lauded the new one to the skies. Gluck was\r\nperfectly indifferent to all this strife of party. Not once, since the\r\nfirst day of rehearsal, had his countenance lost its expression of calm\r\nand lofty security. Resolved to conquer, he receded before no obstacle.\r\nIn vain had the prima donna, the renowned Gabrielle, complained of\r\nhoarseness: Gluck blandly excused her, and volunteered to send for her\r\nrival, Tibaldi, to take the role of Eurydice. This threat cured the\r\nhoarseness, and Gabrielle attended the rehearsals punctually. In vain\r\nhad Guadagni attempted, by a few fioritures, to give an Italian turn to\r\nthe severe simplicity of Orpheus's air. At the least deviation from his\r\ntext, Gluck, with a frown, would recall the ambitious tenor, and do away\r\nwith his embellishments. In vain had the chorus-singers complained of\r\nthe impossibility of learning their parts. Gluck instructed them one by\r\none. He had trained the orchestra, too, to fullest precision; and\r\nfinally, every difficulty overcome, the great opera of \"Orpheus and\r\nEurydice\" was ready for representation on the birthday of the\r\nArchduchess Isabella.\r\n\r\nShortly before the hour of performance, Gluck entered his drawing-room\r\nin a rich court-dress, his coat covered with decorations. His wife met\r\nhim, elegantly attired, and sparkling with diamonds. She held out her\r\nhand, and smiled a happy smile.\r\n\r\n\"Look at me, my hero,\" said she. \"I have arrayed myself in my\r\nwedding-jewels. I feel to-night as I did on the day when we plighted our\r\nfaith to one another before the altar. Then, dear Christopher, our\r\nhearts were united; to-day--our souls. Is it not so? And are we not one\r\nin spirit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dearest, yes,\" replied Gluck, folding her in his arms, \"never have\r\nI so prized and loved you as in these later days of strife and struggle.\r\nWell do I feel what a blessing to man is a noble woman! Often during our\r\nrehearsals, when I have encountered the supercilious glances of\r\nperformers and orchestra, the thought of your dear self has given me\r\nstrength to confront and defy their scorn. And when, weary in mind and\r\nbody, I have found my way home, the touch of your hand has refreshed and\r\ncooled the fever in my heart. And often when others have pronounced my\r\nmusic worthless, I might have despaired, but for the remembrance of your\r\nemotion. I thought of your tears and of your rapture, and hope revived\r\nin my sick heart. Your applause, dear wife, has sustained me to the\r\nend.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, dear Christopher,\" replied Marianne, \"not my applause, but the\r\nmight of your own inspiration. That which is truly great must sooner or\r\nlater prevail over mediocrity.\"\r\n\r\n\"The world is not so appreciative as you fancy. Marianne! Else had\r\nSocrates not drunk of the poisoned beaker, nor Christ, our Lord, been\r\ncrucified. Mediocrity is popular, because it has the sympathy of the\r\nmasses. Not only does it come within their comprehension, but it is\r\naccommodating; it does not wound their littleness. I know, dear wife,\r\nthat my opera is a veritable work of art, and therefore do I tremble\r\nthat its verdict is in the hands of mediocrity. Poor Marianne! You have\r\narrayed yourself for a bridal, and it MAY happen that we go to the\r\nfuneral of my masterpiece.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, even so,\" replied the spirited wife, \"I shall not have decked\r\nmyself in vain; I shall die like the Indian widow, upon the funeral pile\r\nof my dear husband's greatness. I will both live and die with you,\r\nmaestro; whether you are apotheosized or stoned, your worth can neither\r\nbe magnified nor lessened by the world. My faith in your genius is\r\nindependent of public opinion; and whether you conquer or die, your\r\nopera must live.\"\r\n\r\n\"How I wish,\" said Gluck thoughtfully, \"that from above, I might look\r\ndown a hundred years hence and see whether indeed my works will have\r\nvalue on earth, or be thrown aside as antiquated trumpery! But it is\r\nuseless--an impenetrable cloud covers the future, and we must e'en\r\ncontent ourselves with the verdict of the day. Let me be strong to meet\r\nit!--Come, Marianne, the carriage is coming to the door, and we must go.\r\nBut is all this splendor to be hidden behind the lattice-work of my\r\nlittle stage-box?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, Christopher,\" said his wife gayly; \"on such a night as this, I\r\nhave taken another box; from whence I can be a happy witness of my\r\nhusband's triumph.\"\r\n\r\n\"What intrepid confidence the woman possesses!\" exclaimed Gluck,\r\ncatching his wife's gayety. \"But how will my brave champion feel, if she\r\nhas to see as well as hear the hisses that may possibly greet us\r\nto-night!\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall feel heartily ashamed of the audience,\" replied Marianne, \"and\r\nshall take no pains to conceal my contempt.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall see,\" answered Gluck, handing her to the carriage, and\r\nfollowing her with a merry laugh. \"Now, forward!\"\r\n\r\nWithin the theatre all was commotion. On one side, the partisans from\r\nthe old school, who, from prejudice or custom, adhered to Hasse and\r\nMetastasio, predicted failure. This party was composed of Italians, and\r\nof all those who had \"gone out\" with old Austria. New Austria, on the\r\nother hand, with all the young dilettante of Vienna, were resolved to\r\nsustain Gluck, and, if possible, secure to his new opera an\r\nunprecedented triumph. The excitement reached even those boxes where sat\r\nthe elite of the Viennese nobility. Even THEIR voices were to be heard\r\ndiscussing the merits or demerits of the musical apple of discord. The\r\nGluckites related that Guadagni who, at first, had been strongly\r\nprejudiced against the opera, had finally been moved to tears by its\r\nexquisite harmony, and had said to Gluck that he was learning for the\r\nfirst time to what heights of beauty music might soar. The Hasseites\r\nreplied that the opera was none the less tedious for Guadagni's word.\r\nMoreover, if Hasse and Metastasio had not openly condemned Gluck's\r\nmusical innovations, it was because they were both satisfied that the\r\nopera would damn itself, and they were present to witness the\r\ndiscomfiture of its composer. [Footnote: Anton Schmid, \"Ritter von\r\nGluck,\" page 92.]\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a hush in the theatre. The attention of the\r\ndisputants was directed toward a small box, in the first tier, the door\r\nof which had opened to give entrance to two persons. One was an old man\r\nwith silver-white hair, which flowed in ringlets on either side of his\r\npale and delicate face. His thin lips were parted with an affable smile,\r\nand the glance of his small dark eyes was mild, benevolent, and in\r\nkeeping with the rest of his countenance. His small, bent figure was\r\nclothed in the cassock of an abbe, but the simplicity of his costume was\r\nheightened by the order of Theresa which, attached to a silk ribbon,\r\nhung around his neck.\r\n\r\nThe other was a tall, gaunt man, in the dress of court maestro de\r\ncapello. His lean face was proud and serious, his large mouth wore an\r\nexpression of scorn, and his full-orbed, light-blue eyes had a glance of\r\npower which accorded well with his lofty stature. The two advanced arm\r\nin arm toward the railing, and, at their appearance, a storm of applause\r\narose from the parterre, while the partisans of the Italian school\r\ncried; \"Long live Hasse! Long live Metastasio!\"\r\n\r\nThey bowed and took their seats. While this was transpiring, the wife of\r\nGluck entered her box. With a quiet smile she listened to the shouts\r\nthat greeted her husband's rivals.\r\n\r\n\"He too\" thought she, \"will have his greeting and his triumph.\"\r\n\r\nShe was not mistaken. No sooner had Gluck appeared in the orchestra,\r\nthan, from boxes as well as parterre, a thousand voices pealed forth his\r\nwelcome: \"Long live Gluck! long live the great maestro!\"\r\n\r\nGluck bowed gracefully, while Marianne, happy but tranquil, unfolded her\r\njewelled fan, and leaned back in supreme satisfaction. Metastasio\r\nwhispered something to Hasse, who nodded his head, and then began to run\r\nhis fingers through the masses of his bushy, gray hair.\r\n\r\nSuddenly were heard these words: \"Her majesty the empress, and the\r\nimperial court!\"\r\n\r\nHushed now was every sound. Every eye was turned toward the box\r\nsurmounted by the double-headed eagle of Austria. The marshal of the\r\nhousehold appeared with his golden wand, the doors of the box flew\r\nasunder, the audience rose, and the empress, leaning on the arm of the\r\nemperor, entered her box. Magnificently dressed, and sparkling with\r\ndiamonds, her transcendent beauty seemed still more to dazzle the eyes\r\nof her enraptured subjects. She was followed by the archduke, who, in\r\nconversation with his wife, seemed scarcely to heed the greetings of his\r\nfuture subjects. Behind them came a bevy of princes and princesses, all\r\nof whom, including little Marie Antoinette and Maximilian, the two\r\nyoungest, had been permitted to accompany the imperial party. It was a\r\nfamily festival, and Maria Theresa chose on this occasion to appear\r\nbefore her people in the character of a mother.\r\n\r\nThe empress and her husband came forward and bowed. The former then\r\nglided gracefully into her large gilt arm-chair, while the latter signed\r\nto his children to be seated.\r\n\r\nThis was the signal of the music to begin. The audience resumed their\r\nseats, Gluck raised the leader's staff, and signed to the musicians.\r\n\r\nThe overture began. In breathless silence the audience listened to that\r\nshort, earnest overture, whose horns, trumpets, and hautboys seemed to\r\nherald the coming of kings and heroes.\r\n\r\nThe curtain rose, and, in a funeral hall, Orpheus poured forth his grief\r\nfor the loss of his Eurydice. With this pathetic complaint mingled the\r\nvoices of the chorus of mourners; then a solo from Orpheus, in which he\r\nbewails anew the fate of the noble woman who had died for his sake. The\r\ngod of love appears, counselling him to descend himself to the infernal\r\nregions. Orpheus, strengthened and revived by hope, resolves to tempt\r\nthe dangerous descent, and calls upon his friends to share his fate.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first act the curtain fell amid the profoundest\r\nsilence. The Hasseites shrugged their shoulders, and even Gluck's\r\nwarmest adherents felt undecided what to say of this severe Doric music,\r\nwhich disdained all the coquetries of art, and rejected all superfluous\r\nembellishment.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad that Metastasio is here,\" said the empress, \"for his presence\r\nwill prove to Calzabigi that he is not a pensioned dotard. And what\r\nthinks my daughter of the opera?\" asked Maria Theresa of the infanta.\r\n\r\nBut when she saw Isabella's face, her heart grew faint with fear. The\r\narchduchess was pale as death, and her countenance wore an expression of\r\ngrief bordering on despair. Her large, dark eyes, distended to their\r\nutmost, were fixed upon the ceiling; and she seemed as if she still\r\nheard the wailings of Orpheus and the plaintive chorus of his friends.\r\n\r\nJoseph saw nothing of this. He had taken a seat farther back, and was\r\nchatting gayly with his little brothers and sisters.\r\n\r\n\"God help me!\" murmured the empress; \"she looks as if she were dying!\r\nOh, if she were right with her dismal prophecy of death! What if indeed\r\nshe is to leave us? Have mercy, O God! I know that I love her too well.\r\nShe will be taken from me; Heaven will claim from me this sacrifice!\"\r\n[Footnote: The empress's words. Caraccioli, \"Life of Joseph II.,\" page\r\n87.]\r\n\r\nIsabella shuddered, and awakened from her horrid dream. Her eyes fell,\r\nher cheeks flushed, and once more her lips parted with a gentle smile.\r\nWith a tender and appealing look, she turned toward the empress and\r\nkissed her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your majesty,\" whispered she; \"the music has entranced and\r\nbewildered me. I was in another world, and was lost to the present.\"\r\n\r\n\"The music pleases you, then?\" asked the empress.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, your majesty,\" cried Isabella, \"this is no music to give pleasure;\r\nit is the sublimest language of truth and love!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the empress tenderly, \"if you prize it so highly, dearest,\r\nI will prove to you how dearly I love you, for your verdict and mine\r\ndisagree. Our next festive day will be that on which Joseph is to be\r\ncrowned King of Rome. And we shall do homage to the taste of the Queen\r\nof Rome by ordering that this opera be repeated on the occasion of her\r\ncoronation.\"\r\n\r\nIsabella shook her head. \"I shall not live long enough to be crowned\r\nQueen of Rome.\" [Footnote: Isabella's own words. Wraxall, ii., page 394.]\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa was about to murmur a reply, when the curtain rose, and\r\nthe second act of the opera opened.\r\n\r\nThe audience, who had been loudly canvassing the music, were silenced,\r\nand awaited in breathless expectation the unfolding of the plot. Soon\r\ncame the wonderful scene between Orpheus and the furies who guard the\r\ngates of Avernus. The beseeching tones of Orpheus, and the inexorable\r\n\"No!\" of the furies, made every listener tremble. Even Hasse, overcome\r\nby the sublimity of the music, bowed his head with the rest; and\r\nMetastasio, enraptured with the words, murmured, \"Ah, che poesia\r\ndivina!\" Murmurs of applause were heard from every side of the theatre;\r\nthey grew with every scene, and at last burst forth in wild shouts. It\r\nseemed as if the audience were gradually rising to the appreciation of\r\nthis new and unknown music, until with one accord its matchless beauty\r\nburst upon their hearts and overpowered them.\r\n\r\nWhen the curtain fell a second time, the applause knew no bounds. The\r\nGluckites, in triumphant silence, hearkened to the voices of the\r\ndeeply-moved multitude, who gave full vent to their emotions, and\r\nnoisily exchanged the thoughts to which the wonderful opera had given\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\nMarianne, supremely happy, listened enraptured, while wreaths fell in\r\nshowers around the head of her beloved husband. The adherents of Hasse\r\nand Metastasio no longer dared to raise their voices in opposition to\r\nthe public verdict. In this state of excitement the third act began.\r\nWith increasing delight, the audience listened. When Eurydice, condemned\r\nto return to the infernal regions, sang her plaintive aria, sobs were\r\nheard throughout the theatre, and murmurs of applause were audible\r\nduring the whole scene. But when Orpheus concluded his passionate aria\r\n'Che faro senza Eurydice,' the people could contain their enthusiasm no\r\nlonger. Exalted, carried away, with beating hearts and tearful eyes,\r\nthey cried \"Da capo!\" and when Guadagni, in compliance with the call,\r\nhad repeated his solo, the audience shouted out so often the name of\r\nGluck, that he could resist his joy no longer. He turned, and they saw\r\nhis noble face scarlet with blushes; then arose another storm. Again and\r\nagain the \"vivas\" and the clappings were renewed, each time more frantic\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\nHasse, tired of the spectacle of his rival's triumph, had disappeared.\r\nMetastasio, more magnanimous, had remained, and applauded as loudly as\r\nany. Marianne, to conceal her tears, had hidden her face behind her open\r\nfan; and as the applause of the people increased, until it resembled the\r\nshouts of victory, she murmured: \"I knew it, I knew it! The true and\r\nbeautiful must always prevail.\"\r\n\r\nThe fire of enthusiasm had spread to the imperial box. The emperor had\r\nmore than once been heard to call out, \"Bravo!\" and Maria Theresa had\r\nseveral times felt her eyes grow dim. But she brushed away her tears and\r\nexclaimed: \"It is beautiful, certainly; but it is a heathen opera, in\r\nwhich not God but gods are invoked!\"\r\n\r\nIsabella said nothing. She had held up before her face the bouquet which\r\nher husband had gathered for her, that her tears might fall unseen among\r\nits flowers. Joseph saw those tears shining like dew-drops upon its\r\nrose-leaves, and, taking it from her hands, he kissed them away. \"Do not\r\nweep, my Isabella,\" whispered he tenderly; \"your tears fall like a\r\nweight of sorrow upon my heart. Wipe them away, beloved. The day will\r\ncome when you also shall be an empress, and your people will do you\r\nhomage as I do now; and then you will have it in your power to heal\r\ntheir sorrows, and wipe away their tears; and they will love and bless\r\nyou as I--\"\r\n\r\nA final burst of applause drowned the voice of the archduke. The opera\r\nwas at an end, and the people were calling again for Gluck, the creator\r\nof the lyric drama.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\"IN THREE YEARS, WE MEET AGAIN.\"\r\n\r\nThe war was over. All Vienna was rejoicing that the struggle which had\r\ncaused so much bloodshed was at an end, and that Austria and Prussia had\r\nmade peace.\r\n\r\nNeither of the two had gained any thing by this long war, except\r\nglorious victories, honorable wounds, and a knowledge of the power and\r\nbravery of its enemy. Both had serious burdens to bear, which, for many\r\nyears to come, would be painful reminders of the past. Austria, to cover\r\nthe expenses of the war, had invented paper money, and had flooded the\r\nempire with millions of coupons. Prussia had coined base money, and all\r\nthe employes of the state had received notes, which were nicknamed\r\n\"Beamtenscheine.\" After the war these notes were exchanged for this base\r\ncurrency, which soon afterward was withdrawn from circulation as\r\nworthless. But Prussia had obtained from Austria full recognition of her\r\nrights to Silesia, and she in return had pledged herself to vote for\r\nJoseph as candidate for the crown of Rome, and to support the\r\npretensions of the empress to the reversion of the duchy of Modena.\r\n\r\nWe have said that all Vienna was rejoicing, and turned out to receive\r\nthe returning army with laurel wreaths and oaken boughs. The people\r\nbreathed freely once more; they shouted and feasted, and prepared\r\nthemselves to enjoy to their utmost the blessings of peace.\r\n\r\nBut while the nation shouted for joy, a cloud was gathering over the\r\nimperial palace, and its black shadow darkened the faces of the once\r\nhappy family.\r\n\r\nThere wanted now but a few months to complete the third year of the\r\narchduke's marriage, and the young princesses seized every opportunity\r\nto make schemes of pleasure for the joyous anniversary. Isabella viewed\r\nthese projects with a mournful smile. Her countenance became sadder and\r\nmore serious, except when in the presence of her husband. There she\r\nassumed an appearance of gayety: laughing, jesting, and drawing from her\r\nviolin its sweetest sounds. But, with her attendants, or in the company\r\nof the other members of the imperial family, she was melancholy, and\r\nmade her preparations for death, which she foretold would overtake her\r\nvery soon.\r\n\r\n\"You believe this terrible presentiment, my daughter?\" said the empress\r\nto her one day. \"Will you indeed forsake us who love you so dearly?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not that I will, but that I MUST go,\" replied she. \"It is God who\r\ncalls me, and I must obey.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why do you think that God has called you?\"\r\n\r\nIsabella was silent for a moment, then she raised her eyes with a\r\nstrange, unspeakable look to the face of the empress. \"A dream has\r\nannounced it to me,\" said she, \"a dream in which I place implicit\r\nfaith.\"\r\n\r\n\"A dream?\" said the pious empress to herself. \"It is true that God\r\nsometimes speaks to men in dreams; sometimes reveals to us in sleep\r\nsecrets which He denies to our waking, earthly eyes. What was your\r\ndream, love?\"\r\n\r\n\"What I saw?\" whispered she, almost inaudibly. \"There are visions which\r\nno words can describe. They do not pass as pictures before the eye, but\r\nwith unquenchable fire they brand themselves upon the heart. What I saw?\r\nI saw a beloved and dying face, a breathing corpse. I lay overwhelmed\r\nwith grief near the outstretched form of my--my--mother. Oh, believe me,\r\nthe prayer of despair has power over death itself, and the cry of a\r\nbroken heart calls back the parting soul. I wept, I implored, I prayed,\r\nuntil the dim eyes opened, the icy lips moved and the stiffening corpse\r\narose and looked at me, at me who knelt in wild anguish by its side.\"\r\n\r\n\"Horrible! \"cried the empress. \"And this awful dream did not awake you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I did not awake, and even now it seems to me that all these things\r\nwere real. I saw the corpse erect, and I heard the words which its\r\nhollow and unearthly voice spoke to me: `We shall meet again in\r\nthree--'\"\r\n\r\n\"Say no more, say no more,\" said the pale empress, crossing herself.\r\n\"You speak with such an air of conviction, that for a moment I too\r\nseemed to see this dreadful dream. When had you your dream?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the autumn of 1760, your majesty.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress said nothing. She imprinted a kiss upon the forehead of the\r\ninfants, and hastily withdrew to her own apartments.\r\n\r\n\"I will pray, I will pray!\" sobbed she. \"Perhaps God will have mercy\r\nupon us.\"\r\n\r\nShe ordered her private carriage and drove to St. Stephens, where,\r\nprostrate among the tombs of her ancestors, she prayed for more than an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nFrom this day Maria Theresa became sad and silent, anxiously watching\r\nthe countenance of Isabella, to see if it betokened death. But weeks\r\npassed by, and the infanta's prophecy began to be regarded as a delusion\r\nonly fit to provoke a smile. The empress alone remained impressed by it.\r\nShe still gazed with sorrowing love at the pale and melancholy face of\r\nher daughter-in-law.\r\n\r\n\"You have made a convert of my mother,\" said the Archduchess Christina\r\none day to Isabella, \"although,\" added she, laughing, \"you never looked\r\nbetter in your life.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, Christina, you do not believe?\" said Isabella, putting her arm\r\naround Christina's neck. \"You, my friend, and the confidante of my\r\nsorrows, you would wish to prolong the burden of this life of secret\r\nwretchedness and dissimulation?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe in the goodness of God, and in the excellence of your own\r\nheart, dear Isabella. These three years once passed away, as soon as you\r\nwill have been convinced that this prophecy was indeed nothing but a\r\ndream, your heart will reopen to life and love. A new future will loom\r\nup before you, and at last you will reward the love of my poor brother,\r\nnot by noble self-sacrifice, but by veritable affection.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would that you spoke the truth!\" returned Isabella sadly. \"Had my heart\r\nbeen capable of loving, I would have loved him long ago--him, whose\r\nnoble and confiding love is at once my pride and my grief. Believe me\r\nwhen I tell you that in these few years of married life I have suffered\r\nterribly. I have striven with my sorrows, I have tried to overcome the\r\npast, I have desired to live and to enjoy life--but in vain. My heart\r\nwas dead, and could not awake to life--I have only suffered and waited\r\nfor release.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gracious Heaven!\" cried Christina, unmoved by the confidence with which\r\nIsabella spoke, \"is there nothing then that can bind you to life? If you\r\nare cold to the burning love of your husband, are you indifferent to\r\nyour child?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think that I will leave my child?\" said Isabella, looking\r\nsurprised. \"Oh, no! She will come to me before she is seven years old.\"\r\n[Footnote: The infanta's own words. This interview of Isabella with\r\nChristina is historical, and the most extraordinary part of it is, that\r\nthe prophecy of her child's death was fulfilled.]\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Isabella, Isabella, I cannot believe that you will be taken from\r\nus,\" cried Christina, bursting into tears, and encircling her sister\r\nwith her arms, as though she fancied that they might shield her from the\r\ntouch of death. \"Stay with us, darling, we love you so dearly!\"\r\n\r\nHer voice choked by emotion, she laid her head upon Isabella's shoulder,\r\nand wept piteously. The infanta kissed her, and whispered words of\r\ntenderness, and Christina's sobs died away. Both were silent. Together\r\nthey stood with sad hearts and blanched cheeks, two imperial princesses\r\nin the prime of youth, beauty, and worldly station, yet both bowed down\r\nby grief.\r\n\r\nTheir lips slightly moved in prayer, but all around was silent. Suddenly\r\nthe silence was broken by the deep, full sound of a large clock which\r\nstood on the mantel-piece. Isaella raised her pale face, and listened\r\nwith a shudder.\r\n\r\nFor many months this clock had not struck the hour. The clockmaker, who\r\nhad been sent to repair it, had pronounced the machinery to be so\r\ncompletely destroyed, that it would have to be renewed. Isabella could\r\nnot summon resolution to part with the clock. It was a dear memento of\r\nhome, and of her mother. She had therefore preferred to keep it,\r\nalthough it would never sound again.\r\n\r\nAnd now it struck! Loud, even, and full-toned, it pealed the hour, and\r\nits clear, metallic voice rang sharply through the room.\r\n\r\nIsabella raised her head, and, pointing to the clock, said, with a\r\nshudder: \"Christina, it is the signal--I am called!\" [Footnote:\r\nHistorical. Wraxall, p. 387.]\r\n\r\nShe drew back, as if in fear, while the clock went on with its\r\nrelentless strokes. \"Come, come, let us away!\" murmured Christina, with\r\npale and trembling lips.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, come,\" sighed Isabella.\r\n\r\nShe made a step, but her trembling feet refused to support her. She grew\r\ndizzy, and sank down upon her knees.\r\n\r\nChristina uttered a cry, and would have flown for help but Isabella held\r\nher back. \"My end approaches,\" said she. \"My senses fail me. Hear my\r\nlast words. When I am dead, you will find a letter for you. Swear that\r\nyou will comply with its demands.\"\r\n\r\n\"I swear!\" said Christina, solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"I am content. Now call the physician.\"\r\n\r\nDay after day of anguish went by--of such anguish as the human heart can\r\nbear, but which human language is inadequate to paint.\r\n\r\nIsabella was borne to her chamber, and the imperial physician was called\r\nin. The empress followed him to the bedside, where pale and motionless\r\nsat Joseph, his eyes riveted upon the beloved wife who, for the first\r\ntime, refused to smile upon him, for the first time was deaf to his\r\nwords of love and sorrow.\r\n\r\nThe physician bent over the princess and took her hand. He felt her\r\nhead, then her heart, while the empress, with folded hands, stood\r\npraying beside him: and Joseph, whose eyes were now turned upon him,\r\nlooked into his face, as if his whole soul lay in one long gaze of\r\nentreaty.\r\n\r\nVan Swieten spoke not a word, but continued his examination. He bade the\r\nweeping attendants uncover the feet of the princess, and bent over them\r\nin close and anxious scrutiny. As he raised his eyes, the archduke saw\r\nthat Van Swieten was very pale.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, doctor,\" cried he, in tones of agony, \"do not say that she will\r\ndie! You have saved so many lives! Save my wife, my treasured wife, and\r\ntake all that I possess in the world beside!\"\r\n\r\nThe physician replied not, but went again to the head of the bed, and\r\nlooked intently at the face of the princess. It had now turned scarlet,\r\nand here and there was flecked with spots of purple. Van Swieten\r\nsnatched from Joseph one of the burning hands which he held clasped\r\nwithin his own.\r\n\r\n\"Let me hold her dear hands,\" said he, kissing them again and again.\r\n\r\nThe doctor held up the little hand he had taken, which, first as white\r\nas fallen snow, was now empurpled with disease. He turned it over,\r\nlooked into the palm, opened the fingers, and examined them closely.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor, in mercy, speak!\" said the agonized husband. \"Do you not see\r\nthat I shall die before your eyes, unless you promise that she shall\r\nlive!\"\r\n\r\nThe empress prayed no longer. When she saw how Van Swieten was examining\r\nthe fingers of the archduchess, she uttered a stifled cry, and hiding\r\nher head with her hands, she wept silently. At the foot of the bed knelt\r\nthe attendants, all with their tearful eyes lifted to the face of him\r\nwho would promise life or pronounce death. Van Swieten gently laid down\r\nthe hand of his patient, and opened her dress over the breast. As though\r\nhe had seen enough, he closed it quickly and stood erect.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were now fixed upon Joseph with an expression of deep and\r\npainful sympathy. \"Speak,\" said Joseph, with trembling lips, \"I have\r\ncourage to hear.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is my duty to speak,\" replied Van Swieten, \"my duty to exact of her\r\nmajesty and of your highness to leave the room. The archduchess has the\r\nsmall-pox.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa sank insensible to the floor. From the anteroom where he\r\nwas waiting the emperor heard the fall, and hastening at the sound, he\r\nbore his wife away.\r\n\r\nJoseph, meanwhile, sat as though he had been struck by a thunderbolt.\r\n\r\n\"Archduke Joseph,\" cried Van Swieten, \"by the duty you owe to your\r\ncountry and your parents I implore you to leave this infected spot.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph raised his head, and a smile illumined his pale face. \"Oh,\" cried\r\nhe, \"I am a happy man; I have had the small-pox! I at least can remain\r\nwith her until she recovers or dies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but you will convey the infection to your relatives.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not leave the room, doctor,\" said Joseph resolutely. \"No inmate\r\nof the palace shall receive the infection through me. I myself will be\r\nIsabella's nurse until--\"\r\n\r\nHe could speak no more; he covered his face with his hands, and his\r\ntears fell in showers over the pillow of his unconscious wife.\r\n\r\nVan Swieten opposed him no longer. He was suffered to remain, nursing\r\nthe archduchess with a love that defied all fatigue.\r\n\r\nOf all this Isabella was ignorant. Her large, staring eyes were fixed\r\nupon her tender guardian, but she knew him not; she spoke to him in\r\nwords of burning tenderness, such as never before had fallen from her\r\nlips; but while she poured out her love, she called him by another name,\r\nshe called him Riccardo--and while she told him that he was dearer to\r\nher than all the world beside, she warned him to beware of her father.\r\nSometimes, in her delirium, she saw a bloody corpse beside her, and she\r\nprayed to die by its side. Then she seemed to listen to another voice,\r\nand her little hands were clasped in agony, while, exhausted with the\r\nhorror of the vision, she murmured, \"Three years! three years! O God,\r\nwhat martyrdom! In three years we meet again!\"\r\n\r\nHer husband heeded not her wild language, he listened to the music of\r\nher voice. That voice was all that was left to remind him of his once\r\nbeautiful Isabella; it was still as sweet as in the days when her beauty\r\nhad almost maddened him--that beauty which had flown forever, and left\r\nits possessor a hideous mass of blood and corruption.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth day of her illness Isabella recovered from her delirium.\r\nShe opened her eyes and fixed them upon her husband with a look of calm\r\nintelligence. \"Farewell, Joseph!\" said she softly. \"Farewell! It is over\r\nnow, and I die.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, darling, you will not die,\" cried he, bursting into tears. \"You\r\nwould not leave me, beloved, you will live to bless me again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not sorrow for me,\" said she. \"Forgive and forget me.\" As Joseph,\r\novercome by his emotion, made no reply, she repeated her words with more\r\nemphasis: \"Forgive me, Joseph, say that you forgive me, for otherwise I\r\nshall not die in peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forgive thee!\" cried he. \"I forgive thee, who for three years hast made\r\nmy life one long sunny day!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou wert happy, then,\" asked she, \"happy through me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was, I AM happy, if thou wilt not leave me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" sighed the wife, \"I die in peace. He was happy, I have done my\r\nduty, I have atoned--\"\r\n\r\nHer head fell back. A long, fearful silence ensued. Suddenly a\r\nshriek--the shriek of a man, was heard. When the attendants rushed in,\r\nIsabella was dead, and Joseph had fallen insensible upon the body.\r\n[Footnote: This extraordinary account of the life and death of the\r\ninfanta, Isabella of Parma, is no romance; it rests upon facts which are\r\nmentioned by historians of the reign of Maria Theresa. Caroline Pichler,\r\nwhose mother was tire-woman to the empress when the archduchess died,\r\nrelates the history of the prophecy, wherein Isabella, first in three\r\nhours, then in as many days, weeks, months, and years, awaited her\r\ndeath. She also relates the fact of her death at the expiration of three\r\nyears, \"in the arms of her despairing husband.\" Caroline Fichler,\r\n\"Memoirs of my Life.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nCHE FARO SENZA EURYDICE.\r\n\r\nThe funeral rites were ended, and Isabella of Parma slept in St.\r\nStephen's, in the tomb of the kaisers.\r\n\r\nJoseph had refused to attend the funeral. From the hour his\r\nconsciousness had returned to him he had locked himself within his\r\napartments, and night and day he was heard pacing the floor with dull\r\nand measured tread. Not even the empress, who had stood imploring at the\r\ndoor, could obtain a word in answer to her entreaties. For two days and\r\nnights lie remained within. On the third day the emperor knocked at the\r\ndoor, and announced to his son that all was now ready for the funeral,\r\nand his presence was indispensable.\r\n\r\nJoseph opened the door, and, without a word, leaned upon his father's\r\narm, and traversed the long suite of apartments hung in black, until\r\nthey reached the room where lay the body of his wife. There, amid\r\nburning wax-lights, was the hideous coffin that enclosed his beloved\r\none, and was about to bear away forever his life, his love, and his\r\nhappiness. When he saw the coffin, a stifled cry arose from his breast.\r\nHe darted with open arms toward it, and, bending down, hid his face upon\r\nthe lid.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the doors of the room were opened, and the empress\r\nentered, attended by her daughters, all in deep mourning. Their faces\r\nwere wan with weeping, as were those of all who followed the bereaved\r\nsovereign. Meanwhile Joseph neither saw nor heard what passed around\r\nhim. The ceremonies began, but while the priest performed the funeral\r\nrites, the archduke murmured words which brought tears to the eyes of\r\nhis father and mother.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa approached her stricken son. She kissed his hair, and laid\r\nher hand lovingly upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"My son,\" said she, with quivering lip, \"arise and be a man. Her soul is\r\nwith God and with us; let us give her body to the earth that bore it.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the empress spoke, the bells of the churches began to toll, and\r\nfrom the streets were heard the beating of muffled drums, and the\r\nbooming of the cannon that announced to Vienna the moving of the funeral\r\nprocession.\r\n\r\n\"Come, my son, come,\" repeated the empress. \"Our time of trial is at\r\nhand.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph raised his head from the coffin, and stared wildly around. He saw\r\nthe priests, the acolytes with their smoking censers, the weeping\r\nattendants of his wife; he saw the black hangings, the groups of\r\nmourners, and his father and mother standing pale and sad beside him; he\r\nheard the tolling of the bells and the dull sound of the funeral drum;\r\nand now, now indeed he felt the awful reality of his bereavement, and\r\nknew that as yet he had suffered nothing. Tears filled his eyes, and he\r\nsank upon his father's breast. Sobs and wailings filled the funeral\r\nhall, while without the inexorable knell went on, the drums still beat,\r\nthe cannon roared, all calling for the coffin, for whose entrance the\r\nimperial vault lay open.\r\n\r\nOnce more Joseph approached this dreadful coffin. He kissed it, and\r\ntaking from it one of the roses with which it had been decked, he said,\r\n\"Farewell, my wife, my treasure; farewell, my adored Isabella!\" Then\r\nturning toward the empress, he added, \"Thank you, dearest mother, for\r\nthe courage which bears you through this bitter trial; for me, I cannot\r\nfollow you. Greet my ancestors and say to them that never came a nobler\r\nvictim to the grave than the one which you bear thither to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will not go with us!\" said the empress, astounded.\r\n\r\n\"No, mother, no. Mingle dust with dust, but do not ask me to look into\r\nmy Isabella's grave.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned, and without a word or another look at the coffin, he left the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\"Let him go,\" whispered the emperor. \"I believe that it would kill him\r\nto witness the funeral ceremony.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress gave a sign, and the cortege moved with the coffin to the\r\ncatafalque, which, drawn by twelve black horses, awaited the body in\r\nfront of the palace.\r\n\r\nJoseph once more retreated to his room, and there, through the stillness\r\nof the deserted palace, might be heard his ceaseless tramp, that sounded\r\nas though it might be the hammer that was fashioning another coffin to\r\nbreak the hearts of the imperial family. At least it seemed so to the\r\nsorrowing empress, who listened to the dull sound of her son's footsteps\r\nwith superstitious fear. She had gone to him, on her return from the\r\nfuneral, to console him with her love and sympathy. But the door was\r\nlocked, and her affectionate entreaties for admission were unanswered.\r\n\r\nShe turned to the emperor. \"Something must be done to bend the obstinacy\r\nof this solitary grief,\" said she anxiously. \"I know Joseph. His is a\r\npassionate and obdurate nature, strong in love as in hate. He had\r\nyielded his whole soul to his wife, and now, alas! I fear that she will\r\ndraw him with her to the grave. What shall we do, Franz, to comfort him?\r\nHow shall we entice him from this odious room, which he paces like a\r\nlion in his cage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go once more and command him to open the door. He will not have the\r\ncourage to defy you,\" said the emperor.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa knocked again, and cried out, \"My son Joseph, I command\r\nyou, as your sovereign and mother, to open the door.\"\r\n\r\nNo answer. Still the same dull, everlasting tread.\r\n\r\nThe empress stood awhile to listen; then, flushing with anger, she\r\nexclaimed, \"It is in vain. We have lost all control over him. His sorrow\r\nhas made him cruel and rebellious, even toward his mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this is unmanly,\" cried the emperor with displeasure. \"It is a\r\nmiserable weakness to sink so helpless under grief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Think you so?\" said the empress, ready to vent upon the emperor her\r\nvexation at the conduct of her son. \"In your pride of manhood you deem\r\nit weak that Joseph grieves for his wife. I dare say that were your\r\nmajesty placed in similar circumstances, you would know full well how to\r\nbear my loss like a man. But your majesty must remember that Joseph has\r\nnot your wisdom and experience. He is but a poor, artless youth, who has\r\nbeen weak enough to love his wife without stint. This is a fault for\r\nwhich I crave the emperor's indulgence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, your majesty,\" replied the emperor, smiling, \"God forbid that he\r\nshould ever grow less affectionate! I was only vexed that the voice of\r\nMaria Theresa should have less power over my son than it has over his\r\nfather; that silvery voice which bewitched me in youth, and through life\r\nhas soothed my every pang.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress, completely softened, reached out her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Would you, indeed, mourn for me, Franz?\" said she tenderly. \"Would you\r\nrefuse to listen to father or mother for my sake? My dearest, you would,\r\nI believe. From our childhood we were lovers, we will be lovers in our\r\nold age, and when we part the one that is left will mourn as deeply as\r\nJoseph. Let us, then, be lenient with his grief, until our love and\r\nforbearance shall have won him to come and weep upon his mother's\r\nbreast.\"\r\n\r\n\"If your majesty permit,\" said Christina, stepping forward, \"I will try\r\nto soften his grief.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can you do, dear child?\" asked the empress of her favorite\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\n\"I have a message for him,\" replied Christina. \"I swore to Isabella that\r\nno one but myself should reveal it to Joseph. I know that it will prove\r\nconsolatory, and Isabella also knew it. For this reason she intrusted it\r\nto me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Try, then my daughter, try if your voice will have more power than\r\nmine. Meanwhile I will essay the power of music. It over-came him once\r\nwhen he was a boy. We will try him with the music that Isabella loved\r\nbest.\"\r\n\r\nShe called a page and spoke with him in a low voice. In conclusion she\r\nsaid, \"Let the carriage go at once and bring him hither in a quarter of\r\nan hour.\"\r\n\r\nThe page withdrew, and the imperial family were again alone. \"Now, my\r\ndaughter,\" said the empress, \"see if he will speak to you.\"\r\n\r\nChristina approached the door. \"My brother Joseph,\" said she, \"I beseech\r\nyou open the door to me. I come from Isabella; it is she who sends me to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThe bolt was withdrawn, and for a moment the pale face of Joseph\r\nappeared at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Come in,\" said he, waving his hand to Christina. She followed him into\r\nthe room where so many, many tears had been shed. \"Now speak,\" said he,\r\n\"what did Isabella say to you?\"\r\n\r\nHis sister looked with pity upon his ghastly face and those hollow eyes\r\ngrown glassy with weeping. \"Poor, poor Joseph!\" said she softly, \"I see\r\nthat your love for her was beyond all bounds.\"\r\n\r\nHe made a motion of impatience. \"Do not pity me,\" said he. \"My grief is\r\ntoo sacred for sympathy. I do not need it. Tell me at once, what said\r\nIsabella?\"\r\n\r\nChristina hesitated. She felt as if the balm she was about to bring\r\nwould prove more painful than the wounds it was intended to heal.\r\n\r\n\"Speak, I tell you,\" cried Joseph angrily. \"If you have made use of\r\nIsabella's name to gain access to my presence, it is a trick for which I\r\nwill never forgive you. Why did you disturb me? I was with her,\"\r\ncontinued he, staring at the divan where so often they had sat together.\r\n\"She wore her white dress and the pink roses, and she smiled with her\r\nenchanting smile. I lay at her feet, I looked into her eyes, I heard the\r\nmelody of her voice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she ever say that she loved you?\" asked Christina.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her intently and grew thoughtful. \"I do not know,\" said he\r\nafter a pause, \"whether she ever told me so in words. But there needed\r\nno words. I saw her love in every glance, in every smile. Her whole life\r\nwas love, and oh! I have lost it forever!\"\r\n\r\n\"You have not lost it, for you never possessed it,\" said Christina\r\n\r\nJoseph drew back and frowned. \"What is that?\" said be hastily\r\n\r\nChristina approached him, and laying her hand upon his shoulder, she\r\nlooked into his face until her eyes filled with tears.\r\n\r\n\"I say,\" whispered she in a tremulous voice, \"do not mourn any longer,\r\ndear brother. For she for whom you grieve, she whom you call your\r\nIsabella, never loved you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not true,\" cried Joseph vehemently. \"It is a lie, a wicked lie\r\nthat you have devised to lessen my grief.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing but the truth, and I promised Isabella to tell it to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph sank almost insensible upon the divan. Christina seated herself\r\nnear him, and throwing her arms around him, sobbed, \"My brother, my\r\ndarling brother, think no more of the dead, but turn your heart toward\r\nus; for we love you, and Isabella never did. She merely endured your\r\nlove.\"\r\n\r\n\"Endured my love!\" murmured Joseph, and his head sank powerless upon\r\nChristina's bosom. But suddenly he rose, and looking with a beseeching\r\nexpression at his sister's beautiful face, he said\r\n\r\n\"Bethink you, Christina, of what you do. Think that I love Isabella with\r\nall the strength and glow of my heart; think that for me she was the\r\nembodiment of all beauty, goodness, and purity. Do not seek to comfort\r\nme by destroying my faith in the truth of the only woman I have ever\r\nloved. In whom shall I have faith, if not in her? If HER love was a lie,\r\nis there love in this world? Oh, Christina, in mercy say that you have\r\nsought to comfort by deceiving me!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have sought to comfort you, by telling you the truth. If you will not\r\nbelieve me, believe her own words.\"\r\n\r\nShe drew a paper from her dress and handed it to Joseph. \"It is a\r\nletter,\" said she, \"which Isabella gave me, and she made me swear that I\r\nwould fulfil its behests. Read, and be satisfied.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph unfolded the letter. \"It is her handwriting,\" said he to himself,\r\nand he tried to read it but in vain; his hand trembled, and his eyes\r\nfilled with tears.\r\n\r\nHe gave it back to Christina, who read it aloud:\r\n\r\n\"My Christina--confidant of my sufferings and sorrow--hear my dying\r\nrequest. To you I leave the task of consoling my husband. His noble\r\ntears shall not be shed over the grave of one who is unworthy of them.\r\nTell him the truth, tell him all you know, show him this letter, and bid\r\nhim not grieve for one who never loved him. Do this for me, it is my\r\nlast request. ISABELLA.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly, from the adjoining room, the sweet tones of music were heard;\r\nthe air was tremulous with melody, which at first soft and low, swelled\r\nlouder and louder until it filled the room with a gush of harmony that\r\nstirred the hearts of those who listened with sweetest and holiest\r\nemotions.\r\n\r\nJoseph bent eagerly forward. He knew those strains so well! He\r\nremembered the night when Isabella's tears had fallen among the\r\nrose-leaves, and he had kissed them away. He saw her once more in the\r\npride of her beauty, looking at him from the depths of those glorious\r\ndark eyes which he had so madly loved. The music gave life and being to\r\nthese memories, and its glamour brought back the dead from her grave! He\r\nremembered how he had asked her if she loved him, and how, avoiding the\r\nwords so difficult to speak, she had answered with the witching tones of\r\nher violin. Oh, that heavenly evening hour upon the balcony! She had\r\nsaid, \"Love has its own language: come and listen.\" And Christina said\r\nSHE HAD NOT LOVED! He could not, would not believe her!\r\n\r\nHe took the letter from Christina's hand and kissed the paper. \"I do not\r\nbelieve you,\" he said softly. \"My trust in her is like my sorrow--for\r\neternity!\"\r\n\r\nThis imperturbable faith had the effect of hardening Christina, and\r\nmaking her cruel. \"You shall believe me,\" said she hastily. \"You shall\r\nsee in her own handwriting that she loved another.\"\r\n\r\n\"ANOTHER! \"cried the wretched husband. \"I will kill him!\"\r\n\r\n\"He died before you ever knew her,\" said Christina, frightened at the\r\neffect of her own heartlessness.\r\n\r\nA smile overspread his face. \"Dead, before I knew her! Then she forgot\r\nhim when I loved her.\" He took up the letter and read it again. \"Oh,\"\r\nsaid he, \"see how magnanimous was my Isabella. She has been false to her\r\nown heart that she might save me from sorrow. She thought it would dry\r\nmy tears to think that she did not love me. Oh, beloved, I see through\r\nthy noble falsehood--in death as in life I know every working of that\r\nunselfish heart!\"\r\n\r\nChristina said nothing, but she grew more inflexible in her purpose. \"He\r\nshall be convinced,\" said she to herself. \"I will give him her letters\r\nto me, and then he will know that he never has been loved.\"\r\n\r\nAgain pealed forth the sounds of that heavenly music. Now the violin,\r\nmingling with the tones of the harpsichord, glide into a melody of\r\ndivinest beauty; and the full, rich tones of a woman's voice warbled the\r\ncomplaint of Orpheus: \"Che faro senza Eurydice!\"\r\n\r\nJoseph sighed convulsively, and a faint color tinged his pale cheeks.\r\nThis was Isabella's favorite air; and once more the vision started up\r\nbefore him, once more he saw the tears, he kissed them, and looked into\r\nthe depths of those starry eyes!\r\n\r\nHe rose from the divan, and, drawn thither by a power which he could not\r\ncontend, he left the room, and followed the music that was calling him\r\nfrom madness back to reason.\r\n\r\nAt the harpsichord sat Ritter Gluck, and by him stood the Archduchess\r\nElizabeth, whose rich and beautiful voice had exorcised the evil spirit.\r\n\r\nThe emperor and empress, with all their children, came forward to meet\r\nthe unhappy one, and all with tearful eyes kissed and welcomed him with\r\ntender words of love.\r\n\r\nGluck alone seemed not to have seen the archduke. He was chiding\r\nElizabeth for singing falsely, and called upon her to repeat her song.\r\nNevertheless, while he corrected his pupil, the big tears were coursing\r\none another down his cheeks, and fell upon his hands, as they wandered\r\nover the instrument, enrapturing every ear.\r\n\r\nElizabeth began again; and again were heard the heart-breaking tones of\r\n\"Che faro senza Eurydice!\"\r\n\r\nAll eyes turned upon the bereaved Orpheus. The empress opened her arms,\r\nand completely subdued, he darted to his mother's heart, and cried out,\r\n\"Che faro senza Eurydice!\"\r\n\r\nAgain and again the mother kissed her weeping son. The emperor folded\r\nthem both to his loving heart. The brothers and sisters wept for mingled\r\ngrief and joy. Elizabeth's voice failed her, and she sang no more. But\r\nGluck played on, his hands weaving new strains of harmony such as earth\r\nhad never heard before. His head thrown back, his eyes upturned toward\r\nheaven, his face beaming with inspiration, he listened to his music,\r\nwhile from Joseph's anguish was born the wonderful song in Alceste, \"No\r\ncrudel, no posso vivere, to to sai, senza de te.\"\r\n\r\nThe melody went on, the parents caressed their child, and on his\r\nmother's bosom Joseph wept the last tears of his great youthful sorrow.\r\nThe dream of love was over! Grief had made of him a man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKING OF ROME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nFATHER PORHAMMER AND COUNT KAUNITZ.\r\n\r\nThe empress paced her cabinet with hasty steps. Near the large table,\r\ncovered with papers of state, stood Father Porhammer.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure of what you say?\" said Maria Theresa with impatience. \"Are\r\nyou sure that the lord chancellor so far forgets his honor and dignity\r\nas to spend his hours of leisure in the company of disreputable\r\nactresses? Is it true that his house is the scene of shameful orgies and\r\nsaturnalian feasts?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is even so, your majesty,\" replied Porhammer. \"It is unhappily true\r\nthat he whom your majesty has raised to the first place in the empire\r\nof--\"\r\n\r\n\"The first place!\" echoed the empress angrily. \"Know, sir, that the\r\nfirst place in the empire is mine. From God I hold my power and my\r\ncrown, and I depute them to no man--I alone reign in Austria.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty,\" resumed the father, \"did not allow me to finish. I was\r\nabout to say that he whom your majesty has made your most illustrious\r\nsubject, he who ought to give to all your subjects an example of moral\r\nconduct, is a profligate and libertine. That infamous school of Paris,\r\nwhere reigns the wanton Marquise de Pompadour, the debauched court of\r\nVersailles--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold, father, and remember that France is Austria's dearest ally,\"\r\ninterrupted the empress.\r\n\r\nThe father bowed. \"The school of Parisian gallantry, of which the lord\r\nchancellor is a graduate, has borne its fruits. Count Kaunitz mocks at\r\nreligion, chastity, and every other virtue. Instead of giving an\r\nhonorable mistress to his house, it is the home of Foliazzi, the singer,\r\nwho holds him fast with her rosy chains.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must send her away from Vienna.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, your majesty, if you send her, Count Kaunitz will go with her. He\r\ncannot live without La Foliazzi. Even when he comes hither to your\r\nmajesty's august presence, La Foliazzi is in his coach, and she awaits\r\nhis return at the doors of the imperial palace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible! I will not believe such scandalous reports. Count Kaunitz\r\nnever would dare bring his mistresses to my palace doors; he never would\r\nhave the audacity to treat his official visits to myself as episodes in\r\na life of lasciviousness with an unchaste singer. You shall withdraw\r\nyour words, Father Porhammer, or you shall prove them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will prove them, your majesty.\"\r\n\r\nJust then the door opened, and a page announced the lord chancellor,\r\nCount Kaunitz.\r\n\r\n\"Admit Count Kaunitz,\" said the empress, \"and you, Father Porhammer,\r\nremain.\"\r\n\r\nThe father withdrew within the embrasure of a window, while the lord\r\nchancellor followed the page into the presence of the empress. The\r\ncount's face was as fair and his cheeks as rosy as ever; he wore the\r\nsame fantastic peruke of his own invention, and his figure was as\r\nstraight and slender as it had ever been. Ten years had gone by since he\r\nbecame prime minister, but nothing had altered HIM. So marble-like his\r\nface, that age could not wrinkle, nor care trace a line upon its stony\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nHe did not wait for the imperial greeting, but came forward in his\r\ncareless, unceremonious way, not as though he stood before his\r\nsovereign, but as if he had come to visit a lady of his own rank.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty sees,\" said he, with a courteous inclination of the head,\r\n\"that I use the permission which has been granted me, of seeking an\r\naudience whenever the state demands it. As I come, not to intrude upon\r\nyour majesty with idle conversation, but to speak of grave and important\r\nmatters of state, I do not apologize for coming unbidden.\"\r\n\r\nThe easy and unembarrassed manner in which Kaunitz announced himself had\r\nits effect upon the empress. She who was so accustomed to give vent to\r\nthe feelings of the moment, overcame her displeasure and received her\r\nminister with her usual affability.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty, then, will grant an audience to your minister of state?\"\r\nsaid Kaunitz, looking sharply at the priest who stood unconcerned at the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\"Since the lord chancellor comes at such an unusual hour,\" replied the\r\nempress, \"I must conclude that his business is of an imperative nature.\r\nI am therefore ready to hear him.\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz bowed, and then turning with an arrogant gesture toward the\r\nempress's confessor, he said, \"Do you hear, Father Porhammer? the\r\nempress will hold a council with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hear it, my lord,\" said the priest.\r\n\r\n\"Then as we are not on the subject of religion, you will have the\r\ngoodness to leave the room.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was ordered by her majesty to remain,\" replied Father Porhammer\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\nKaunitz turned toward the empress, who, with knit and angry brow, was\r\nlistening to her minister.\r\n\r\n\"If it be the empress's pleasure,\" said he, bowing, \"I will take the\r\nliberty of retiring until her majesty is at leisure for earthly affairs.\r\nReligion and politics are not to be confounded together; the former\r\nbeing the weightier subject of the two, I give way.\"\r\n\r\nHe bowed again, and was about to leave the room, when the empress\r\nrecalled him.\r\n\r\n\"Stay!\" said she. \"Father Porhammer will leave us for a while.\"\r\n\r\nWithout a word, the father bowed and withdrew.\r\n\r\n\"Now speak, Count Kaunitz,\" said the empress, hastily, \"and let the\r\naffair be important that has led you to drive my confessor, in such an\r\nuncourteous fashion, from my presence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Weighty, most weighty is the news that concerns the imperial house of\r\nAustria,\" said Kaunitz, with his unruffled equanimity. \"A courier has\r\nbrought me tidings of the archduke's election as King of Rome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\" said Maria Theresa. \"That is no news. The voice of Prussia\r\ndecided that matter long ago; and this is the only advantage we have\r\never reaped from our long and terrible war with Frederick?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty, no, this is not the only thing we have obtained. This\r\nwar has yielded us material advantages. It has increased the military\r\nstrength of the country; it has placed before the eyes of all Europe the\r\ninexhaustible nature of Austria's resources; it has brought all the\r\nlittle Germanic principalities under Austria's dominion. It has united\r\nHungary, Sclavonia, Italy, Bohemia, and Lombardy under Austria's flag\r\nand Austria's field-marshals. Indeed, your majesty, this war has given\r\nus something of far more value than Prussia's vote. The bloody baptism\r\nof the battle-field has made Austrians of all those who bled for\r\nAustria's rights.\"\r\n\r\n\"That does not prevent that abominable man from clinging to my fair\r\ndomain of Silesia. How will my ancestor, the great Charles, greet me\r\nwhen I go to my grave, bearing the tidings that under my reign Austria\r\nhas been shorn of a principality?\"\r\n\r\n\"No such tidings shall your majesty bear to your forefathers,\" replied\r\nKaunitz, fervently. \"Leave Frederick alone with his bit of a\r\nprincipality; more trouble than profit may it be to him! Long before he\r\nwill have transformed his Silesian Austrians into loyal Prussians, we\r\nshall have repaired the damage he has done us by new and richer\r\nacquisitions.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no!\" cried the empress, \"let us have no more war. What we do\r\nnot possess by just right, I never will consent to win with the sword.\"\r\n\r\n\"But inheritance and alliance bestow rights,\" persisted the minister.\r\n\"Your majesty has marriageable daughters and sons, and it is time to\r\nthink of negotiating honorable alliances for them.\"\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the empress sparkled, and her face beamed with happy smiles.\r\nThe establishment of her children was her constant thought by night and\r\nday, and in broaching this subject, Kaunitz was meeting her dearest\r\nwishes. Her displeasure against him melted away like snow before the\r\nsun, and she gave herself up entirely to the pleasing discussion.\r\n\r\n\"It will be difficult to find husbands for my daughters\" said she. \"All\r\nthe reigning heads of European families are married, and their sons are\r\ntoo young for Elizabeth and Amelia. I cannot marry my grown-up daughters\r\nto boys; nor can I bring a set of insignificant sons-in-law to hang\r\nabout the court. My husband the emperor would never consent to bestow\r\nhis daughters upon petty princes, who, instead of bringing influence\r\nwith them, would derive their reflected consequence from an alliance\r\nwith us. If we cannot find them husbands worthy of their station, my\r\ndaughters must remain single, or devote their lives to God.\"\r\n\r\n\"If your majesty's eldest daughters choose that holy vocation, politics\r\nneed not interfere with their inclinations, the boyish heirs of European\r\nkingdoms can await the advent of the younger princesses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let them wait,\" said the empress; \"we will train noble queens for\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the Archduke Leopold need not wait,\" said Kaunitz; \"we will begin\r\nwith him. The Spanish ambassador has received from his sovereign, Carlos\r\nIV., a letter directing him to offer his daughter Maria Louisa to your\r\nmajesty's second son. Knowing that his highness the Archduke Joseph is\r\nyour majesty's successor, he supposes that the Emperor Francis will\r\nbestow upon his second son the grand duchy of Tuscany. \"\r\n\r\n\"A very good alliance,\" returned Maria Theresa, nodding her head. \"The\r\nwomen of the house of Bourbon are all estimable. Our lost Isabella was a\r\nlovely woman. Well, the grand-daughter of the King of Spain having died,\r\nlet us renew our connection with him through his daughter; and may God\r\ngrant to Leopold happier nuptials than were those of my poor Joseph.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Archduke Joseph, too, must marry,\" said Kaunitz. \"Poor Joseph!\"\r\nsighed the empress; \"even now his heart is full of sorrow; and while he\r\nmourns his dead, we make plans to marry him to another! But you are\r\nright, count; he must marry. We cannot listen to his heart, he must\r\nsacrifice himself to duty. Austria must have another heir. But let us\r\ngive him a little respite.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will forget his sorrow when he is crowned King of Rome,\" said\r\nKaunitz. \"Ambition is certain to cure love; and the possession of a\r\ncrown may well console any man for the loss of a woman.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa was displeased. \"Do you deem it, then, so light a thing?\"\r\nsaid she, with a frown, \"to lose a beloved wife? Do you think it great\r\nhappiness to wear a crown? You know nothing either of the pains of power\r\nor the joys of marriage; but I can tell you that many a time I would\r\nhave fainted under the burden of my crown, had my Franz not sustained me\r\nwith his loving and beloved hand. But what know you of love? Your heart\r\nis a market-place wherein you seek slaves for your harem, but no\r\nhonorable woman would make it her home. I have heard scandalous reports\r\nconcerning your house, Count Kaunitz; I have--\"\r\n\r\nA light knock was heard at the door, and as the empress gave the word,\r\nFather Porhammer entered the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nMATRIMONIAL PLANS.\r\n\r\nFather Porhammer came forward, while the empress looked at him with a\r\nglance of astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me, your majesty, for this intrusion. It is in accordance with\r\nyour gracious commands, whose fulfilment I have no right to delay. I was\r\nordered by your majesty to prove the fact which I asserted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, have you the proof?\" said the empress, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"I have, your majesty. It is in the carriage of the lord chancellor, at\r\nthe great door of the palace.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress made an exclamation; and her face grew scarlet with anger.\r\nHer stormy looks rested upon Kaunitz, who, perfectly unconcerned, seemed\r\nnot to have heard what Porhammer had said. This undisturbed serenity on\r\nthe part of her minister gave the empress time for recollection. She\r\nknew from experience that the lightning of her wrath would play\r\nharmlessly about the head of this living statue, and she felt more\r\nkeenly than she had ever done before, that however Kaunitz's private\r\nlife might shock her own sense of honor and decency, his vast intellect\r\nas minister of state was indispensable to Austria.\r\n\r\nWith a quick and haughty gesture, she motioned the priest away, and then\r\nbegan to pace up and down the length of the apartment.\r\n\r\nKaunitz remained tranquil near the table, his cold glances resting now\r\non the papers, now on the pictures that hung opposite to him. He was\r\nbusily engaged arranging his Alengon ruffles, when the empress stopped,\r\nand fixed her fiery eyes upon him.\r\n\r\n\"My lord chancellor, Count Kaunitz, tell me who sits in your carriage\r\nbefore the doors of my palace, awaiting your return from this\r\nconference?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who sits in my carriage, your majesty? I was not aware that any one was\r\nthere whose name it was necessary for me to announce to your imperial\r\nmajesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can well believe that you would not dare to pronounce the name of\r\nthat person in my presence,\" cried the empress, indignantly \"but let me\r\ntell you, sir count, that your behavior is highly displeasing to me, and\r\nthat I blush to hear the things I do, to the disparagement of your honor\r\nand morality.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has your majesty any complaint to make of me as minister, or as\r\npresident of council?\" asked Kaunitz, almost roughly. \"Have I not\r\nfulfilled the vows I made to your majesty ten years ago? Have I\r\ndischarged my duties carelessly? The ship of state which, in her hour of\r\nperil, was confided to my hands, have I not steered her safely through\r\nrocks and reefs? Or, have I been unfaithful to my trust? If your majesty\r\ncan convict me of crime, or even of negligence, then sit in judgment\r\nupon the culprit. Tell me of what state offence am I accused?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not speak of my prime minister,\" replied the empress somewhat\r\nembarrassed. \"I have no fault to find with HIM. On the contrary, he has\r\nnobly kept the pledge he made to me and to my Austria, and he has been a\r\nwise, faithful, and conscientious servant. But this is not enough; there\r\nare also duties to perform toward God, toward society, and toward one's\r\nself.\"\r\n\r\n\"For your majesty, as well as for me, it suffices that I am true to my\r\nduties as your subject. As to my duty as a man, this is no place to\r\ndiscuss a matter which lies between God and myself it would be\r\nindecorous for me to raise the veil of my private life before the eyes\r\nof your majesty. I came here to speak of Austria's welfare and yours,\r\nnot of me or mine.\"\r\n\r\nWithout giving the empress time to make any reply, Kaunitz resumed the\r\nsubject which had been interrupted by the visit of Father Porhammer.\r\n\r\n\"Though your majesty may deem it expedient to postpone the marriage of\r\nthe Archduke Joseph, still, that need not prevent us from taking the\r\nsteps that will be necessary to secure an advantageous alliance for the\r\nheir to the throne. We can grant a respite to the Archduke of Austria,\r\nbut the King of Rome must stifle his grief, and attend to the calls of\r\nduty. He must silence his heart, for the Emperor of Austria must have a\r\nsuccessor.\"\r\n\r\n\"At least let us choose him a bride worthy to succeed in his affections\r\nthe angelic wife he has lost,\" said the empress, with feeling.\r\n\r\nSomething like a smile flitted over Kaunitz's sardonic face. \"Your\r\nmajesty must pardon me, but you view this matter entirely too much as a\r\nthing of sentiment; whereas, in effect, it is an affair of policy. The\r\nmain object of the archduke's marriage is to find a princess whose\r\nfamily can advance the interests of the state, and who is in a condition\r\nto bear children.\"\r\n\r\n\"And have you already found such a wife for my poor child?\" asked the\r\nempress. \"Have you one to propose whom policy will approve, and who will\r\nnot be distasteful to the eye or the heart?\"\r\n\r\n\"She must be a German princess,\" said Kaunitz.\r\n\r\n\"Why MUST?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the house of Hapsburg must court the good-will of all Germany,\r\nwhich, through this long war and from the divided interests of the\r\nGerman people, it is in danger of losing. Prussia, grown morally strong\r\nby the war, is about to become the rival of Austria, and even now she\r\nseeks to have a voice in German politics. Northern Germany already\r\ninclines to Prussia by its sympathies of creed and opinion. If we allow\r\nthis to go on, Prussia will divide Germany into two halves. The northern\r\nhalf, that which is Protestant, and in my opinion the wiser half,\r\nbecause free from the prejudices of religion, will belong to enlightened\r\nPrussia; the southern half, the bigoted Catholic portion, that which\r\nbelieves in the pope and his Jesuits, may perhaps adhere to Austria.\r\nThen comes revolution. Prussia will have for her allies, not only\r\nnorthern Germany, but Sweden, England, Holland, Denmark, even Russia.\r\nEvery step she takes in advance will drive back Austria; and the day may\r\ncome when Prussia, our powerful enemy, will seek for the Margrave of\r\nBrandenburg the crown of the Kaisers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never! never!\" exclaimed Maria Theresa, passionately--\"To think of this\r\nlittle Burgrave of Nuremberg, the vassal of Rudolf of Hapsburg, growing\r\nto be the rival of the stately house of Austria! No, no! Never shall the\r\nday dawn when Austria descends to an equality with Prussia! We are\r\nnatural enemies; we can no more call the Brandenburgs brothers than the\r\neagle can claim kindred with the vulture! You are right, count; the\r\nstrife of the battle-field is over, let us gird ourselves for that of\r\ndiplomacy. Let us be wary and watchful; not only the state but the holy\r\nchurch is in danger. I can no longer allow this prince of infidels to\r\npropagate his unbelief or his Protestantism throughout my Catholic\r\nfatherland. We are the ally and the daughter of our holy father, the\r\npope, and we must be up and doing for God and for our country. Now let\r\nus think how we are to check this thirst of Prussia for power.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are two expedients,\" said Kaunitz, calmly interrupting the\r\nempress in her torrent of indignation.\r\n\r\n\"Let us hear them.\"\r\n\r\n\"The first one is to strengthen our interest with Germany either by\r\noffers of advantages and honors, payment of subsidies; or by matrimonial\r\nalliances. For this reason it is that the future king of Rome must\r\nchoose his wife among the princesses of Germany. Through your majesty's\r\nother children we will ally ourselves to the rest of Europe. The\r\nBourbons reign in the south, and they must all be allied to the house of\r\nHapsubrg. Through the marriage of Archduke Leopold with the daughter of\r\nthe King of Spain, we shall gain a powerful ally; and the archduke\r\nhimself, as Grand Duke of Tuscany, will represent Austria's interest in\r\nItaly. If the Crown Prince of Parma and the young King of Naples unite\r\nthemselves to two of your majesty's daughters, then all Italy will be\r\nleagued with Austria. When this is accomplished, the word 'Italy' will\r\nbe a geographical designation, but the country will be an Austrian\r\ndependency. Now for Western Europe. For France, we must confirm our\r\nalliance with her also. The son of the dauphin, the grandson of Louis\r\nXV., is now eleven years old; just three years older than the\r\nArchduchess Marie Antoinette.\"\r\n\r\n\"Truly, Kaunitz, your plans are great,\" cried the empress, her face full\r\nof smiles and radiant with joy. \"The emperor often calls me a\r\nmatch-maker, but I am an insignificant schemer by YOUR side. I must say\r\nthat I approve your plans, and will do all that I can to insure them\r\nsuccess.\"\r\n\r\n\"The most of them are for the future; before all things we must bestir\r\nourselves about the present. You have seen how later, we can secure the\r\nfriendship of the south; that of the north must come through the\r\nmarriage of the King of Rome. His selection of a German princess will\r\nincline all Germany toward your majesty's imperial house. Naarest to\r\nPrussia are the two important principalities of Bavaria and Saxony.\"\r\n\r\n\"And both have unmarried princesses,\" exclaimed the empress, joyfully.\r\n\"I wish we might select the daughter of the Elector of Saxony, for that\r\nhouse has suffered so much for Austria, that I would gladly do it this\r\nfavor. But I have heard that the Princess Mary Kunigunde has very few\r\ncharms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps Josepha of Bavaria may be handsomer,\" said Kaunitz dryly.\r\n\r\n\"She is nevertheless the daughter of Charles VII., and he has never been\r\nmy friend. I have suffered much from this man, and would you have me\r\naccept his daughter as mine?\"\r\n\r\n\"There can be no resentment for bygones in politics,\" said Kaunitz,\r\ndeliberately.\r\n\r\n\"But there may be gratitude for past services,\" exclaimed the empress,\r\nwarmly. \"I shall never forget how Hungary sustained me when this man\r\nwould have robbed me of my crown. I never would have worn my imperial\r\ndiadem but for the help of God, and the sword of St. Stephen, which my\r\nbrave Magyars drew for me on the battle-field! Without Hungary I would\r\nhave been dethroned, and shall I now place the crown of St. Stephen's\r\nupon the brow of an enemy's daughter! It would be an injustice to my\r\nloyal Hungarians. I shall give my voice to Mary of Saxony, but if Joseph\r\nprefers Josepha, I will not oppose his choice. And this matter settled,\r\ntell me your other plans for strengthening the power of Austria.\"\r\n\r\n\"My second plan is to humanize the Hungarian nobles. These nobles reign\r\nin Hungary like so many petty sovereigns. There is no such thing as\r\nnationality among them. The country is divided into nobles and vassals.\r\nThe nobles are so powerful that the government is completely lost sight\r\nof, and the real sovereigns of Hungary are the Magyars.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is in some sense true,\" answered the empress. \"I have often felt\r\nhow dangerous to my rights was the arrogance of my Hungarian subjects.\r\nThey lift their haughty heads too near the regions of royalty.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your majesty's great ancestor, Charles V. once said that nothing\r\nhad a right to lift its head in the vicinity of a king. The very trees\r\nwould he lop, that their branches might not grow too near to heaven; how\r\nmuch more the heads of men, when they were raised too high.\"\r\n\r\n\"But such a policy shall never be mine--I will never buy obedience with\r\noppression. Besides, I have already said that I am under obligations to\r\nmy Hungarian nobles, and I will not injure a hair of their heads.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are other ways of conquering besides the sword,\" said the crafty\r\nKaunitz. \"Coercion would but fortify the Magyars in their insolence.\r\nThese haughty lords must be enticed from their fastnesses to Vienna.\r\nThey must be greeted with honors, titles, and estates. They must be\r\ntaught to love splendor, to spend money, to accumulate debts, until they\r\nbecome bankrupt, and their possessions in Hungary fall into the hands of\r\nthe crown.\"\r\n\r\n\"What an infamous policy!\" cried the empress.\r\n\r\n\"Good, nevertheless,\" said Kaunitz calmly. \"Nothing can be done with the\r\nMagyars by force. They must be vanquished by pleasure, and also by\r\nmarriage. They must be made to take home Viennese wives, who will\r\ninitiate them into the arts of refined life, who will help them to waste\r\ntheir money, and so cut off the wings of their freedom. He who has\r\nlearned to love pleasure will have no taste for sedition, and he who is\r\nin debt is no longer free. Your majesty must bestow gifts and places at\r\ncourt; the Magyars will grow ambitious--they will become hangers-on of\r\nprinces, and--dissipation, ostentation, and extravagance will do the\r\nrest.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Kaunitz was unfolding his satanic schemes, the empress walked up\r\nand down, in visible agitation. When he ceased, she came and stood\r\nbefore him, and with her searching eyes tried to look through the mask\r\nof his impenetrable countenance.\r\n\r\n\"What you have said there,\" said she, \"is a mournful leaf from the book\r\nof worldly wisdom which guides your actions, and it is enough to make an\r\nhonest heart ache to think that good is to be reached by such foul\r\nmeans. My heart struggles against such a course, but my head approves\r\nit, and I dare not listen to my womanly scruples, for I am a sovereign.\r\nMay the wiles of the women of Vienna make loyal subjects of my brave\r\nHungarians! I will bestow honors without end; but for aught else, let it\r\ncome as it may. Extravagance, debt, and sequestration, they must bring\r\nabout themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will follow; and then sequestered estates must go to Austrian\r\nnobles, that our own people may mingle with the Magyars at home, and\r\nstrengthen the influence of your majesty's house in Hungary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say no more,\" said the empress, mournfully. \"Bring them hither, if you\r\ncan. But my heart aches, and my ears burn to have heard what you have\r\nsaid. Say no more of Hungary to me--let us speak of our bright plans for\r\nmy children. It makes me happy to think that so many of them will wear\r\ncrowns.\"\r\n\r\n\"The first will be that of the King of Rome, and I trust that, before\r\nhis coronation, your majesty will have persuaded him to marry one of the\r\ntwo German princesses of whom we have spoken.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Saxon or the Bavarian,\" said the empress. \"I think he will\r\ncomply--for he will understand as well as ourselves the urgency of the\r\ncase. When is the coronation to take place?\"\r\n\r\n\"In two weeks, your majesty.\" \"Then poor Joseph has but fourteen days\r\nfor his grief. When he returns from Frankfort, I shall remind him of his\r\nduty as a sovereign. But hark! It is twelve o'clock--the hour for mass.\r\nIf the lord chancellor has nothing more to propose, I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your majesty. I have an insignificant petition to\r\npresent--it concerns myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a pleasure to me,\" said Maria Theresa, \"to think that in any way\r\nI can gratify you. Speak, then, without fear. What can I do to serve\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is only for the sake of decorum, your majesty,\" replied Kaunitz.\r\n\"You say that I have been useful to the country. I confess that I, too,\r\nthink that I deserve something from Austria. If I were another man, and\r\nKaunitz stood by, as I reviewed in my mind all that he has done and is\r\ntrying still to do to make Austria powerful, I would speak thus to your\r\nmajesty: 'It is in the power of the empress to distinguish merit by\r\nelevating it to a position above the common herd. Your majesty has\r\nhonored Count Kaunitz by calling him your right hand. When the head of a\r\nbody politic is an empress, it is not enough for the right hand to be\r\ncalled a count.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I call you prince?\" laughed Maria Theresa.\r\n\r\n\"Just what I was about to propose to your majesty,\" said Kaunitz, as he\r\nmade a deeper inclination than usual before the empress.\r\n\r\n\"Then it shall be so,\" said she, warmly. \"From this moment my esteemed\r\nminister is Prince Kaunitz, and the letters patent shall be made out\r\nthis very day.\"\r\n\r\nShe extended her hand to the new-made prince, who kissed it fervently.\r\n\r\n\"I take this title, so graciously bestowed, not because it will confer\r\nsplendor upon my own name, but because it will prove to the world that\r\nthose who serve Maria Theresa with fidelity, she delights to honor. And\r\nnow that this trifling matter is arranged, I beg your majesty's\r\npermission to retire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Until to-morrow,\" replied the empress, with a smile.\r\n\r\nShe waved her hand; but as Kaunitz left the room, he heard her following\r\nhim into the anteroom. He had already opened the door leading into the\r\nhall, but hearing her still advance, he turned again, and made a\r\nprofound inclination.\r\n\r\n\"Au revoir, my dear prince,\" said the empress, loud enough for Father\r\nPorhammer, who waited to accompany her to the chapel, to hear her\r\ngreeting.\r\n\r\nThe father could not withhold some trace of his displeasure from his\r\ncountenance, while Kaunitz, with a faint, derisive smile, passed on. The\r\nempress, at that moment, reopened the door, and came out into the hall.\r\nFather Porhammer, advancing to her, said, \"Did I not prove to your\r\nmajesty the truth of my statement concerning the immorality of--\"\r\n\r\n\"The what?\" said the empress, with an absent air. \"Oh yes, yes. I had\r\nforgotten. You wished to prove to me that the lord chancellor had some\r\nperson in his carriage awaiting his return. I believe you,\r\nfather--doubtless there is some one in the carriage of the lord\r\nchancellor, whom it would be improper to name in my presence. But listen\r\nto what I have to say on this subject. It is better for you and for me\r\nnot to see what goes on either in the lord chancellor's house or in his\r\ncarriage. Close your eyes, as I shall mine, to whatever is objectionable\r\nin his life. I cannot afford to lose his services. So far as I am\r\nconcerned, he is blameless. His life may be loose, but his loyalty is\r\nfirm; he is a wise and great statesman, and that, you will allow, is a\r\nvirtue which may well cover a multitude of sins.\"\r\n\r\nFather Porhammer bowed to the will of his sovereign; Prince Kaunitz went\r\non with his life of debauchery.\r\n\r\n\"Let us hasten to the chapel,\" added the empress; and a page throwing\r\nopen the doors of another apartment, Maria Theresa joined her lords and\r\nladies in waiting, and the imperial court entered the chapel.\r\n\r\nBut the thoughts of the empress were more of earth than heaven, on that\r\nmorning. Her heart was filled with maternal cares, and when the services\r\nwere over, and she had arrived at the door of her cabinet, she dismissed\r\nher attendants, and summoned to her presence the marshal of the\r\nhousehold, Count Dietrichstein.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he appeared, Maria Theresa said eagerly: \"Come hither, count.\r\nI wish to have a confidential conversation with you. You are an old and\r\nfaithful servant of my family, and I know that I can depend upon your\r\ndiscretion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty well knows that I would sooner die than betray a secret of\r\nmy imperial mistress,\" exclaimed good, fat, old Dietrichstein,\r\nfervently.\r\n\r\nThe empress looked kindly at his real, good-humored face. \"And you would\r\nrather die than tell me an untruth also, is it not so?\" said she,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n\"That,\" replied Count Dietrichstein, with another smile, \"that is an\r\nembarrassing question; for there are cases, when even your majesty's\r\nself--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes; but in this instance I earnestly desire to hear the\r\nunvarnished truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"If so, your majesty's desire is for me a command, and I will answer\r\ntruthfully whatever you ask.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, listen to me. You have just returned from a tour in Bavaria\r\nand Saxony. Of course you have seen the two princesses. Mary Kunigunde\r\nand Josepha.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know them both,\" said Dietrichstein, puffing.\r\n\r\n\"Well, tell me what sort of person is the Princess Mary Kunigunde?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is slender,\" replied Dietrichstein, shrugging his shoulders;\r\n\"slender as a bean-pole. If your majesty will pardon me the expression\r\nin favor of its truth, her bones rattle as she walks, and if you should\r\nchance to touch her by accident, I pity you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you will retreat from the collision bruised.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a wicked slanderer, count,\" replied the empress. \"You mean to\r\nsay that the Princess of Saxony is frail and feminine in her\r\nappearance.\"\r\n\r\n\"If your majesty pleases, so be it; but if you looked into her serene\r\nHighness's face, you might mistake her for a man, nevertheless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Holy Virgin! what does the man mean?\" cried the empress, astounded.\r\n\r\n\"I mean,\" said the count, with a sort of comic seriousness, \"that the\r\nfrail and feminine princess has a black beard which a cornet might\r\nenvy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, count! you saw her at twilight, and mistook a shadow on her\r\nface for a beard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your majesty, you commanded me to tell the truth. I saw the\r\nprincess by sunlight as well as by candlelight. Under all circumstances,\r\nthis black shadow overhung her not very small mouth; and I have strong\r\nreason for persisting in my opinion that it was a flourishing beard.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Josepha of Bavaria--is she handsomer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Handsomer, your majesty,\" cried the old count. \"It is said that she is\r\na good and estimable person; if this be true, her soul is very, very\r\ndifferent from her body. Indeed, her beauty may be said to rival that of\r\nthe Princess Mary.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a keen critic,\" sighed the empress. \"But suppose you were\r\nobliged to marry either one of the princesses, which one would you\r\nchoose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty!\" exclaimed the old count, horror stricken. \"I never would\r\nhave the assurance to raise my eyes to thoughts of marriage with a\r\nserene highness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said the empress, \"suppose you were a prince and her equal\r\nin birth, which one then would you prefer?\"\r\n\r\nThe count looked at the floor, and was silent.\r\n\r\n\"The truth, the truth!\" cried the empress. \"Speak out and do not fear.\r\nWhatever you say shall be sacred with me. Now tell me, which of the two\r\nwould you take to wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said Count Dietrichstein, with a grimace of excessive\r\ndisgust, \"since your majesty obliges me to suppose the case, I will tell\r\nthe truth. If by any artifice I could escape, nothing on earth would\r\ninduce me to marry either one of them. But if the knife were at my\r\nthroat, and I had no other way of saving my life, I would take the\r\nPrincess Josepha, for she--\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak out,\" said the empress, amused, though sorely disappointed. \"You\r\nwould marry Josepha of Bavaria because--\"\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" sighed the fat old count, \"if she is horribly ugly, she has,\r\nat least, something like a woman's bosom.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa broke out into a hearty laugh. \"You are right,\" said she,\r\n\"the reason is a very good one, and has its weight. I thank you for your\r\ncandor, and will turn over in my mind what you have told me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But your majesty has promised not to betray me,\" protested the count\r\nwith imploring look.\r\n\r\n\"And I will keep my promise faithfully,\" replied the empress, reaching\r\nhim her hand. \"Nevertheless, I cling to the hope that you have\r\nexaggerated the defects of the princesses, and that they are not\r\naltogether as ugly as you have pictured them to me.\" [Footnote: This\r\nconversation is historical, and the criticism of Count Dietrichstein\r\nupon the two princesses, as here related, is almost verbatim. See\r\nWraxall's \"Memoirs,\" vol. ii., page 406.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nJOSEPHA OF BAVARIA.\r\n\r\nFestivity reigned at the court and throughout the city of Vienna. The\r\nweather was cold, but the streets were thronged with people and hung\r\nwith garlands. Nothing was thought of but balls, illuminations, and\r\ndress. Every one was curious to see the splendid spectacle of the\r\nday--the entrance of the bride of the King of Rome into Vienna.\r\n\r\nThe plans of the lord chancellor were beginning to unfold themselves.\r\nThe Archduke Joseph had been crowned King of Rome at Frankfort, and the\r\nempress on his return, had prepared him for his second bridal. He had\r\nstoutly refused at first, but finally had yielded to the reasonings of\r\nhis mother and the persuasions of his father. He had been told to choose\r\nbetween Mary Kunigunde and Josepha.\r\n\r\nNot far from Toplitz, as if by accident, he met the Princess Mary out on\r\na hunting party. The princess was on horseback; but she rode awkwardly,\r\nand her demeanor was shy and ungraceful. She well knew the object of\r\nthis casual meeting, and when the King of Rome approached to greet her,\r\nshe turned pale and trembled as she felt the gaze of his large blue\r\neyes. Her paleness did not increase her beauty, nor did her shyness\r\ncontribute to make her interesting. Joseph was annoyed at her\r\ntaciturnity and disgusted with her ugliness. After a few brief words he\r\nbowed, and galloped off to join his retinue. The princess looked sadly\r\nafter him, and returned home with a troubled heart. She knew that she\r\nhad been disdained, and that the King of Rome would never choose her for\r\nhis bride.\r\n\r\nShe was right. Joseph preferred the Princess Josepha, whom he had also\r\n\"met by chance.\" He, like Count Dietrichstein, having the knife at his\r\nthroat, selected her for his bride who was minus the flourishing black\r\nbeard.\r\n\r\nIt was the 22d of January of the year 1765, and the wedding-day of the\r\nKing of Rome. From early morning the archduchesses at the palace had\r\nbeen practising a lyric drama from the pen of Metastasio called \"Il\r\nParnasso Confuso.\" The music was by Gluck, and his deep bass was heard\r\naccompanying the sweet rich voices of the bridegroom's sisters. They had\r\nstudied their parts diligently, and felt quite confident of success, as\r\nthey gathered around the maestro. But Gluck was never satisfied, and he\r\nkept Apollo and the Muses at their music-lesson until their ladies of\r\nhonor were obliged to inform them that they must positively retire to\r\ntheir toilets, a courier having arrived to say that the princess had\r\nentered the gates of the city.\r\n\r\nWhile all these preparations were going on around him, the King of Rome\r\ntarried in his private apartments. He was in the room wherein he had\r\nlocked himself after the death of Isabella, the room where day and night\r\nhe had deplored his lost happiness, until Christina had so rudely\r\nawakened him from his dream of love and sorrow.\r\n\r\nThis miserable consolation had had its effect. Joseph wiped away his\r\ntears, and having read Isabella's letters and convinced himself that she\r\nnever had loved him, he had forborne to murmur at her loss.\r\n\r\nOn this, his bridal-day, he was thinking of the time when alone and\r\nheart-broken he had paced this room for three days and nights; and now,\r\nsurrounded by festivity and splendor, he paced the floor again, awaiting\r\nthe moment when he should have to mount his horse and meet the princess.\r\nHe was not with the living bride, but with the dead one; and as he\r\nthought of her grace, her smiles, her surpassing beauty, his lip curled\r\nwith a sneer, and his brow grew dark and stormy.\r\n\r\n\"And she, too, deceived me,\" said he; \"those smiles, those glances, that\r\nlove, all were false. While she lay in my arms and listened to my words\r\nof love, her heart was in the grave with her murdered lover! Oh, my God!\r\nnow that I know that she deceived me, in whom can I place my trust? Even\r\nnow, what am I but a dependent boy, the slave of the empress and of her\r\nall-powerful minister, who force upon me a woman whom I hate, and bid me\r\nmake her the mother of my children? Oh, when will my shackles fall, when\r\nshall I be free!\"\r\n\r\nIn the distance was heard the dull sound of a cannon. \"Already!\" cried\r\nthe unhappy bridegroom. \"It is time for me to meet my bride, and to\r\nbegin the loathsome farce of a second bridal. Verily, if I did not hate\r\nthis Josepha, I could pity her. She will not find me a loving husband.\r\nThe Queen of Rome will never be an enviable woman!\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he threw around his shoulders his velvet cloak edged with\r\nermine, and left the room to join his retinue. They were to meet the\r\nprincess and accompany her to the castle of Schonbrunn. It was there\r\nthat the imperial family awaited the bridal party, and there in the\r\nchapel the marriage was to be solemnized.\r\n\r\nThe streets were thronged with people that shouted for joy: the\r\nbalconies and windows were filled with elegant women, who smiled and\r\nwaved their hands in greeting to the royal pair. For all the world this\r\nwas a day of rejoicing, except for the two persons for whose sake the\r\nrest rejoiced. These had no part in the universal gayety; and the mirth\r\nwhich was inspired by their presence found no echo in their\r\nsouls--Joseph's heart was full of dislike and ill-will toward his\r\nbetrothed, and she was unhappy, fearing the reception that awaited her.\r\nShe had trembled as she thought of the meeting with Joseph, and then of\r\nthe proud, powerful, and beautiful woman who was his mother. The fame of\r\nher intellect, fascinations, and beauty had reached the court of Munich,\r\nand poor Josepha knew very well that SHE was neither handsome,\r\ncultivated, nor charming. Her education had been neglected, and if she\r\nhad attained to the honor of being Queen of Rome and Empress-elect of\r\nAustria, it was not that she had any right to a station so exalted, it\r\nwas that her brother was childless and had promised his inheritance to\r\nAustria.\r\n\r\nJosepha was sad as she thought of these things, but she could not\r\nsuppress an emotion of joy when she saw the brilliant cortege hat was\r\ncoming from Vienna to meet her. This proud and handsome horseman, whose\r\nblue eyes shone like stars, this was her husband, the lord of her\r\ndestiny! She had seen him once before, and had loved him from that\r\nmoment. True, he had not chosen her from inclination, but she could not\r\nshut her heart to the bliss of being his wife, he who, to-day a king,\r\nwould in future years place an imperial crown upon her brow.\r\n\r\nAnd now the two cavalcades met; the carriage of the princess drew up,\r\nand the King of Rome dismounting, came toward her with a low inclination\r\nof the head. Around them stood the noblemen of his suite, whose splendid\r\nuniforms and decorations dazzled the eye with their brilliancy. They\r\nsprang from their horses and each one reverentially saluted the\r\nbride-elect. This done, the King of Rome assisted her to alight, that\r\nshe might mount the magnificent horse which was now led forward by the\r\nempress's chief master of the horse.\r\n\r\nWhen her betrothed held out his hand to her, Josepha, blushing, looked\r\nat him with a timid and tender glance, which seemed to implore a return\r\nof her love. She could not speak a word, but she pressed his hand.\r\n\r\nJoseph, so far from returning the pressure, looked surprised--almost\r\ndisdainful; and, stepping back, he left to the master of the horse and\r\nthe other lords in waiting the care of assisting the princess to mount.\r\nShe sprang into the saddle with perfect confidence, and grasped her\r\nreins with so much skill, that although the beautiful animal reared and\r\npranced until his bridle was covered with foam, his rider was perfectly\r\nat ease.\r\n\r\n\"She is, at least, a good horsewoman,\" said Joseph to himself, as he\r\ntook his place by her side.\r\n\r\nAnd now the bells chimed merrily, and the cannon proclaimed to all\r\nVienna that the royal pair were about to enter the city.\r\n\r\nSilently they rode through the flower-strewn streets, silently they\r\nheard the joyous shouts of the multitude, here and there smiling wearily\r\nin return, but both tired of splendor, and both longing for rest.\r\nNeither spoke to the other; what had they to say to one another--they\r\nwhom policy had chained together for life?\r\n\r\nAt the farther end of the city the state-coach of the empress awaited\r\nthe princess. With an indifferent and careless air, Joseph handed\r\nJosepha to the carriage. This time she dared not press his hand; but as\r\nthe door closed upon herself and her governess, she threw herself back\r\nupon the velvet cushions and wept bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"For the love of Heaven, what mean these tears, your highness?\" cried\r\nthe governess. \"Your highness's head-dress will be ruined, and your eyes\r\nwill be swollen.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis true,\" murmured Josepha, \"I have no right to weep as other women\r\ndo, at such a time. I am nothing but a puppet, that laughs or weeps as\r\netiquette ordains.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your highness is excited and does not see your destiny in its true\r\nlight,\" replied the lady, with sympathy. \"It is one which any woman on\r\nearth might envy. You are about to become the wife of the handsomest\r\nprince in all Europe, an emperor in prospect, and son of the great Maria\r\nTheresa, whose beauty and goodness are the theme of the whole world. And\r\nthen the lovely and accomplished Archduchesses of Austria--they are to\r\nbe your sisters-in-law!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the princess, passionately, \"and look at me. You have known\r\nme since my infancy, dear friend, therefore you need not flatter me\r\nbecause of my station. Look at me, and tell me if it is not enough to\r\nbreak my heart, that I must appear before this beautiful empress and her\r\ndaughters, and that I must try to win the affections of this prince, the\r\nglance of whose eye is enough to kindle love in the heart of every woman\r\nliving--oh say, and speak without reserve--tell me if a woman so\r\nobscure, so ignorant, and so destitute of charms, can ever hope to be\r\nloved or cherished by such a family?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your highness is worthy of all affection, and deserves the choicest of\r\nthe blessings that are in store for you,\" replied the lady of honor\r\nwarmly. \"No one knowing your noble heart would say that any station is\r\ntoo exalted for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! who will be troubled with looking into my heart in imperial\r\nVienna?\" sobbed the disheartened Josepha. \"Externals are every thing in\r\ncourt; and I, unhappy one, who scarcely dare not utter my heart's\r\nyearnings to those who encourage me, what will become of me if I meet\r\nwith cold glances or scornful words? I feel how little I am skilled to\r\nwin love, and the consciousness of my defects heightens them and renders\r\nme still more repulsive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your highness is unjust toward yourself. No one else would ever dream\r\nof speaking in such terms of you. Be happy, dear lady, and you will soon\r\ngrow comely, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Happy!\" sighed the princess, looking from the window at the elegant and\r\ngraceful prince, who, cold and stern as though he had been following the\r\ndead, vouchsafed not a look toward the carriage where sat his bride.\r\n\r\nWith another sigh she turned her head. Her eyes encountered those of the\r\ngoverness, fixed upon her in wondering sympathy. With a bitter smile\r\nJosephs, laid her hand upon the shoulder of her friend.\r\n\r\n\"I must tell you something, Lucy,\" said she--\"something terrible and\r\nsad. Hear well my words, and mark them! I already love my betrothed\r\nbeyond power of expression; but he will never return my love. I shall\r\nworship him, and I feel that he will hate me!\"\r\n\r\nBlushing painfully at the sound of her own words, the princess hid her\r\nface in her hands.\r\n\r\nThe carriage stopped, and now the confused and self-tortured girl had to\r\ngo forward to meet the emperor, who waited at the foot of the great\r\nstaircase to conduct her to the presence of the empress. Maria Theresa\r\ncame gracefully forward, surrounded by her beautiful daughters and a\r\ndazzling train of lords and ladies. Josepha's head reeled when she saw\r\nthem, and almost fainting, she sank down at the feet of the empress.\r\n\r\n\"Mercy, gracious empress, mercy!\" sobbed the poor girl, almost beside\r\nherself with terror; while, regardless of all courtly decorum, she\r\ncovered the hand of Maria Theresa with tears and kisses.\r\n\r\nA sneer was perceptible on the faces of the courtiers, and the young\r\narchduchesses smiled derisively; but Maria Theresa, whose generous heart\r\nbeat in sympathetic response to the emotion and fright of the poor young\r\nstranger, kindly raised her up, and, kissing her forehead, encouraged\r\nher with gracious words.\r\n\r\n\"Be welcome, my daughter,\" said she, in her clear and silvery voice,\r\n\"May all the happiness be yours through life! Come, my children, let us\r\nhasten to the chapel.\"\r\n\r\nShe made a sign to her husband, and took the arm of the King of Rome.\r\nThe emperor followed with the Princess Josepha, and now through the\r\nsplendid halls, that dazzled the eye with festive magnificence, came the\r\nlong train of courtiers and ladies that graced the pageant of this royal\r\nbridal. In the chapel, before the altar, stood Cardinal Megazzi,\r\nsurrounded by priests and acolytes, all arrayed in the pomp and splendor\r\nattendant on a solemn Catholic ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe princess had not been wedded by proxy; it was therefore necessary\r\nthat she should be married with the blessings of the church, before she\r\nproceedcd in state to the throne-room to receive the homage due to her\r\nas a queen. No time had therefore been given her to retire before the\r\nceremony, and she was married in her travelling-dress. At the entrance\r\nof the chapel stood the new ladies in waiting of the Queen of Rome. One\r\nof them relieved her of her hat, which the empress replaced by a wreath\r\nof myrtle. Then Maria Theresa, having placed the hand of Josepha in that\r\nof her son, the imperial cortege approached the altar.\r\n\r\nAs they stood before the chancel, the King of Rome, overcome by the\r\nbitterness of the moment, bowed his head to his unfortunate bride and\r\nwhispered, \"Poor Josepha, I pity you!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE MARRIAGE NIGHT.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonial was over. The empress herself had conducted the young\r\nQueen of Rome to her apartments; and she had stood by her side, while\r\nher tire-woman exchanged her dress of golden tissue for a light white\r\nnegligee of finest cambric trimmed with costly lace. With her own hand\r\nMaria Theresa unfastened the myrtle-wreath and coronet of diamonds that\r\nencircled her daughter-in-law's brow. She then kissed Josepha\r\naffectionately, and, bidding her good-night, she besought the blessing\r\nof God upon both her children.\r\n\r\nAnd now the princess was alone in this vast apartment. On one side,\r\nunder a canopy of blue velvet embroidered with gold, was the state-bed\r\nof the Queen of Rome. Close by stood the toilet of gold with its\r\nwilderness of jewels and etuis, all the gifts of the empress. On the\r\nwalls of blue velvet hung large Venetian mirrors, filling the room with\r\nimages of that gorgeous bed of state. In the centre, on a marble table,\r\nthirty wax-lights in silver candelabra illumined the splendor of the\r\nscene. The heavy velvet window curtains were closed; but they threw no\r\nshadow, for the park of Schonbrunn was illuminated by two hundred\r\nthousand lamps, which far and near lit up the castle on this festive\r\nevening with a flood of fiery splendor. [Footnote: Hormayer,\r\n\"Reminiscences of Vienna,\" vol. v., page 81.]\r\n\r\nThe Queen of Rome was alone, her bridesmaids and attendants had left\r\nher, and she awaited her husband, who would enter her room through a\r\nprivate door which, close to the bed of state, led to his own\r\napartments.\r\n\r\nWith beating heart and in feverish suspense, trembling with hope and\r\nfear, Josepha paced her magnificent room. Heavy sighs broke from her\r\nbosom, hot tears fell from her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"He will come,\" cried she, wringing her hands, \"he will come and look\r\ninto my face with his heavenly blue eyes, and I--I shall cast down mine\r\nlike a culprit, and dare not confide my secret to him. O God! O God! I\r\nhave sworn to conceal my infirmity, for it is not contagious and will\r\nharm no one--and yet my heart misgives me when I think that--Oh, no! no!\r\nIt will soon be over, and he will never have known it. Were he told of\r\nit, it might prejudice him against me, and how could I bear to see those\r\nbeauteous eyes turned away from me in disgust? I will keep my secret;\r\nand after--my love shall atone to him for this one breach of faith. Oh,\r\nmy God! teach me how to win him! I have nothing to bring to this\r\nsplendid court save the gushing fountains of my love for him--oh, my\r\nfather, why have I nothing but this to offer--why have I neither beauty\r\nnor grace to please my husband's eyes--for I love him, oh, I love him\r\nalready more than my life!\"\r\n\r\nShe started, for she heard a sound near the side door. Now the key\r\nturned in the lock, and in another moment the king walked in. He still\r\nwore the magnificent Spanish court-dress in which he had received the\r\nhomage of his marriage guests. The order of the Golden Fleece was on his\r\nbreast, and also the sparkling diamond cross of the imperial house of\r\nHapsburg. Josepha, blushing, recalled to mind her night negligee, and\r\ndared not raise her eyes.\r\n\r\nFor a while they stood opposite to one another, Josepha, in painful\r\nconfusion; Joseph, his eyes bent with cold scrutiny upon her person. At\r\nlength he approached and touched her gently on the arm.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you tremble so?\" asked he kindly. \"Raise your head and look at\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nSlowly she lifted her eyes, and looked at him with a gaze of entreaty.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said be, with a bitter smile, \"am I so frightful that you have\r\nreason to tremble at my coming?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not tremble from fear or fright,\" said she, in a voice scarcely\r\naudible.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you have no confidence in me,\" said he, \"you wish to hide your\r\nemotions from me. And yet madame, let me tell you that nothing but\r\nmutual and perfect confidence will help us through this hour and through\r\nlife. Come, then. Josepha, I will set you the example. I will confide in\r\nyou without reserve. Give me your hand and let us sit together on yonder\r\ndivan.\"\r\n\r\nShe placed her trembling hand within his, and he led her to the sofa. A\r\nflood of deep and silent joy overwhelmed her heart, as alone in that\r\nroyal apartment, which was hers, she sat by the side of this man whom\r\nshe had already loved with passion.\r\n\r\n\"First, madame, let me ask your forgiveness for accepting a hand which\r\nwas not freely bestowed by yourself, but was placed in mine by the\r\ninexorable policy of the destiny that rules kings. In obeying the\r\ncommands of your brother, you have not only married one whom you did not\r\nknow, but perhaps you have been forced to stifle other wishes, other\r\ninclinations.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" cried she, earnestly, \"no. I have left nothing to regret, I have\r\nmade no sacrifice, I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you have sacrificed your freedom, the most precious boon that\r\nHeaven has bestowed on man, to become the galley-slave of policy and\r\nprincely station. Poor Josepha, I pity you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not pity me,\" said Josepha, tearfully, \"pity yourself, whose freedom\r\nhas been sacrificed to me. You have given your honored hand to a woman\r\nwhom you do not love, a woman who would be too happy--\"\r\n\r\n\"Had she the power to free herself and me from this compulsory union,\"\r\ninterrupted Joseph. \"I believe you, for I read in your countenance that\r\nyour heart is good and noble, and gladly would contribute to the\r\nhappiness of your fellow-creatures. But we must both accept the destiny\r\nwhich the hand of diplomacy has woven for us. The heads that wear the\r\ncrowns must also wear the thorns. But we will try to lighten the pain to\r\none another. You have become my wife without love, and I, too, have\r\nbecome your HUSBAND--without love.\"\r\n\r\nJosepha's head fell, she sighed, and murmured something which Joseph\r\ncould not hear.\r\n\r\nHe went on: \"I do not come to you with vain pretensions of a man who\r\nfancies he has won an honorable woman's heart because the priest has bid\r\nthem love one another. I will not take advantage of the rights which\r\neither diplomacy or church has given me over you. Here at least there\r\nshall be no dissimulation; here we shall both be privileged to avow\r\nhonestly and honorably that we are not lovers. Then let us be friends. I\r\ncome to you in all frankness, offering myself to be to you as a brother.\r\nPerhaps it may come to pass that I win your love; perchance your\r\ngoodness and your worth may win my sad heart back again to life--the day\r\nmay come when we shall be able to say that we love each other. Let us\r\nawait this day, and soften the interval by mutual confidence and trust.\r\nAnd should it ever come to us, Josepha, we will then seal with\r\nheart-felt embrace the bond which the church has made between us to-day.\r\nTake me, then, as brother and friend, and be to me a sister and\r\ncompanion. Will you, Josepha?\"\r\n\r\nHe reached out his hand, and looked at her with a glance of brotherly\r\nkindness. She gave him hers with a mournful smile, and her eyes sought\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome, then, my friend and sister,\" said Joseph warmly. \"Now for\r\nunreserved confidence. You promise me that, do you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise,\" gasped the poor girl.\r\n\r\n\"And you will open your heart that I may read its every page?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will--I promise to keep nothing from you.\" \"I promise the same to\r\nyou, and perhaps this plant of friendship may one day bear the flowers\r\nof love. You are inexperienced in the ways of court-life. You will need\r\na pilot to steer you safe amid reefs and breakers. I will be this pilot\r\nto you, I will teach you what to suspect and to avoid. Above all, never\r\nventure to have an opinion that does not coincide with that of the\r\nempress. We are all a pious and well-brought-up family who see with her\r\neyes, and hear with her ears, and never dare confess that we possess\r\nsight or hearing in our own persons. Recollect that you, too, must fall\r\nin the line of puppets, and give up your senses to the empress.\"\r\n\r\n\"But in the depths of my own heart I trust that I may see with the eyes\r\nof the King of Rome,\" replied Josepha with a smile. \"For if I am to\r\nlearn from you, I must surely dare to use my senses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but let no one suspect that you learn any thing from me. In this\r\ncourt we tread on flowers; and if one of our flowers chances to wither\r\nwe cover it over with a pater-noster, and that makes all right again.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose it will not be made right?\" returned Josepha. \"Suppose that\r\nprayer should fail?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gracious Heaven, what do I hear!\" cried Joseph. \"What profane doubt are\r\nyou so bold as to utter! You do not belong to the stupid, pious band,\r\nwho think that prayer cures all woes? Poor Josepha, let no one but me\r\nhear such heresy from your lips--pray, pray; or make believe to pray; no\r\none will ever ask you whether your heart is in it or not. And if any one\r\nseeks to know, answer nothing. Pray on, and mistrust every one.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! mistrust the generous friend whom kind Providence has given to me\r\nthis day!\" cried Josepha with feeling. \"That I can never do. You have\r\nencouraged me to confide in you, and even had you not done so, you would\r\nhave won my confidence unsought. \"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad that you think so,\" returned Joseph. \"Let us begin at once,\r\nthen. Have you a wish that I have it in my power to gratify? Or have you\r\nany thing in your heart which you will confide to me as a proof of your\r\nfaith in my friendship?\"\r\n\r\nJosepha started, and her cheeks grew white with fear. This question\r\nawakened her from her short dream of hope and happiness, and she\r\nremembered that she had a secret which it was her duty to reveal to her\r\nhusband. She looked furtively at him. Perhaps he had heard something,\r\nand this was a trial of her truth. But no! His face was tranquil and\r\nunsuspecting; there was nothing searching in the glance of his deep-blue\r\neyes. No! he knew nothing, and wherefore cloud the brightness of the\r\nhour with a confession which might crush its promise of future bliss?\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Joseph kindly, \"is there nothing on your heart that you\r\nwould confide to your friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" at last said Joseplia resolutely. \"My life has been dull and\r\nuneventful. It is only today that I begin to live; the sun of hope is\r\ndawning upon my heart; I feel as if I might--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hark!\" said Joseph, \"I think I hear some one coming. Yes; there is\r\nsurely a light tap at the door.\"\r\n\r\nThe king rose hastily and crossed the room toward the little side-door.\r\n\r\n\"Is any one there?\" asked he in a loud tone of displeasure.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty,\" whispered a trembling voice, \"and I pray you\r\nearnestly to open the door.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is my valet Anselmo,\" said Joseph to the princess, while he withdrew\r\nthe bolt.\r\n\r\nIt was Anselmo, in truth, who, with mysterious mien, beckoned to his\r\nlord to come out.\r\n\r\n\"Will your majesty condescend to step into the corridor, that I may\r\ndeliver the message with which I am intrusted?\" said the valet.\r\n\r\n\"Is it so weighty, Anselmo, that it cannot lie upon your conscience\r\nuntil morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not one moment can I defer it, your majesty, for I was told that your\r\nmajesty's well-being and health depended upon my speed.\"\r\n\r\nThe king stepped outside and closed the door. \"Who sent you hither,\r\nAnselmo?\" asked he.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know, sire, but I suspect. It was a female form enveloped in a\r\nlong black cloak, with a hood which concealed her face. She came from\r\nthe gallery which leads to the apartments of their imperial highnesses,\r\nyour majesty's sisters, and entered your majesty's own cabinet, which I\r\nhad left open while I was lighting your majesty hither.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what said she?\" asked the king impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"She asked if your majesty had gone into the queen's apartments When I\r\ntold her that you had, she held out this note and said: 'Speed to the\r\nking, and as you value his health and welfare, give him this note at\r\nonce.' She disappeared, and here, your majesty, is the note.\"\r\n\r\nThe king took the paper, which by the dim light of the corridor he could\r\nnot read.\r\n\r\n\"And who do you think is the mysterious lady, Anselmo?\" asked he.\r\n\r\n\"Sire, I do not know. Perhaps your majesty will recognize the\r\nhandwriting.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish to know, Anselmo, who YOU think was hidden under that cloak?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, your majesty,\" said Anselmo, in a whisper scarcely audible,\r\n\"I think it was the Archduchess Christina.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suspected as much,\" said the king to himself. \"It is some intrigue of\r\nhers against the Princess Josepha, whom she hates because I selected her\r\nin preference to the sister of Christina's lover, the Elector of\r\nSaxony.\" [Footnote: The Princess Christina was in love with the Elector\r\nof Saxony; but the Emperor Francis was opposed to the marriage.\r\nChristina used all her influence to bring about a marriage between her\r\nbrother and Mary Kunigunde the sister of her lover, hoping thereby to\r\npave the way for her own union with the handsome Albert. Failing in\r\nthis, she became the bitter enemy of the unhappy woman to whom Joseph\r\nhad given the preference.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps Anselmo understood a few words of this soliloquy, for he\r\ncontinued: \"A courier arrived from Saxony, and I was told by my sister,\r\nthe tire-woman of her highness, that the Archduchess Christina had\r\nreceived a packet of letters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Anselmo,\" said the king, \"if to-morrow you should be asked\r\nwhether you delivered the note, say that I tore it up without opening\r\nit. Do you hear?\"\r\n\r\nDismissing the valet with a wave of the hand, he returned to the\r\nprincess.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me,\" said he, \"for leaving you, and allow me in your presence to\r\nread a note which has just been mysteriously delivered into my hands. I\r\nwish to give you a proof of my confidence, by entrusting you at once\r\nwith my secrets.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he approached the marble centre-table, and opened the letter.\r\n\r\nWhat was it that blanched Josepha's cheek and made her tremble, as\r\nJoseph smiled and looked at her? Why did she stare at him while he read,\r\nand why did her heart stand still with fright, as she saw his expression\r\nchange?\r\n\r\nHe seemed shocked at the contents of the note, and when he raised his\r\neyes and their glance met that of Josepha, she saw them filled with\r\naversion and scorn.\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" said he, and his voice had grown harsh, \"madame, I asked you\r\nin good faith whether you had anything to confide to my honor. I\r\nexpressed a desire to win your confidence. You answered that you had\r\nnothing to tell. Once more I ask, have you any thing to say? The more\r\nhumiliating the confession, the more will I appreciate your candor.\r\nSpeak, therefore.\"\r\n\r\nJosepha answered not a word. Her teeth chattered so painfully that she\r\ncould not articulate; she trembled so violently that she had to grasp\r\nthe back of an arm-chair for support.\r\n\r\nJoseph saw this, and he laughed a hoarse and contemptuous laugh. She did\r\nnot ask him why he sneered. She threw herself at his feet, and raised\r\nher arms imploringly.\r\n\r\n\"Mercy,\" cried the unhappy woman, \"mercy!\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed again, and held the paper before her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Read, madame, read!\" said he rudely.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot,\" sobbed she. \"I will not read what has been written of me. I\r\nwill tell you myself all that I know. I will confide my secret to you; I\r\nwill indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have nothing to confide, madame,\" cried Joseph. \"With a sincere and\r\nholy desire to perform my duty I asked for your friendship and your\r\nconfidence. I cast them both back, for you have allowed the hour of\r\ntrust to go by! Now it is too late! You are accused. Do not look to me\r\nfor protection; vindicate yourself if you can. Read this letter, and\r\ntell me if the writer speaks the truth.\"\r\n\r\nJosepha still knelt at his feet; but her arms had fallen in despair. She\r\nknew that she had nothing more to hope from her husband: she felt that\r\nshe was about to be sentenced to a life of utter misery.\r\n\r\n\"You will not read?\" said Joseph, as unnoticed, Josepha lay at his feet.\r\n\"If so, I must read the letter for you myself. It warns me not to come\r\ntoo near to your royal person. It--\"\r\n\r\n\"I will spare you, sire,\" exclaimed she, as with the energy of despair\r\nshe rose to her feet. \"You will not let me speak, you shall see for\r\nyourself!\"\r\n\r\nWith a frantic gesture, she tore her dress from her neck and shoulders,\r\nand heedless that she stood with arms and bosom exposed, she let it fall\r\nto the floor, and bowed her head as if to receive the stroke of the\r\nheadsman's axe.\r\n\r\n\"Know my secret,\" said she, as she folded her hands and stood before her\r\noutraged husband. \"And now hear me. A few months ago I had a beloved\r\nbrother, whom I loved the more that he was unfortunate and afflicted.\r\nFrom his childhood he had suffered from a malady which his physicians\r\ncalled leprosy. The very servants deserted him, for it was said that the\r\ndisease was contagious. I loved my brother with devotion; I went to him\r\nand nursed him until he died. God shielded me, for I did not take the\r\nmalady. But on my neck and back there came dark spots which, although\r\nthey are painful, are not contagious. My physicians tod me that my\r\nstrong constitution had rejected the leprosy, and these spots were a\r\nregeneration of my skin, which would soon disappear. This, sire, is my\r\nfatal secret; and now judge me. It is in your power to make me the\r\nhappiest of mortals, by granting me a generous pardon; but I will not\r\ncomplain if you condemn and despise me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Complain if you choose, it is indifferent to me,\" cried Joseph, with a\r\nhoarse laugh. \"Never in this world shall you be my wife. If the hateful\r\ntie that binds me to you cannot be unloosed, I will make you answerable\r\nfor every day of disgust and misery that I am forced to pass under the\r\nsame roof with you. If I am cursed before the world with the name of\r\nyour husband. I shall punish you in secret with my everlasting hate.\"\r\n\r\nAs if stricken by lightning, she fell to the floor. Her fallen dress\r\nexposed to view her beautiful form. Her arms, which were folded above\r\nher head, were round and white as those of a Greek statue; and as she\r\nlay with her full, graceful shoulders bared almost to the waist, she\r\nlooked like Niobe just stricken by the wrath of a god.\r\n\r\nJoseph was unmindful of this. He had no sympathy with the noble\r\nsacrifice which her loving heart had offered to a dying brother. He saw\r\nneither her youth nor her grace; he saw but those dark spots upon her\r\nback, and he shuddered as she raised her arm to clasp his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Do not touch me,\" exclaimed he, starting back. \"Your touch is\r\npollution. We are forever divorced. To day the priest joined our bands\r\ntogether, but to-night I part them never more to meet. Farewell.\"\r\n\r\nAnd hurling at her prostrate form the letter which had betrayed her, he\r\nturned and left the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nAN UNHAPPY MARRIAGE.\r\n\r\nIt was the morning after the wedding. Maria Theresa had just completed\r\nher toilet, and was smiling at her own beautiful image reflected in the\r\nlooking-glass. She looked every inch an empress in her rich crimson\r\nvelvet dress, with its long and graceful train, and its border of\r\nermine. Her superb blond hair had been exquisitely dressed by her little\r\nfavourite Charlotte von Hieronymus. It was sprinkled with gold-powder,\r\nand the coiffure was heightened by a little cap of crimson velvet,\r\nattached to the hair by arrows of gold set with costly brilliants. The\r\ncomplexion of the empress was so lovely, that she never wore rouge; and\r\nsurely such eyes as hers needed none of the \"adulteries of art\" to\r\nheighten their brilliancy or beauty. Although she was in her forty-ninth\r\nyear, and had given birth to sixteen children, Maria Theresa was still\r\nbeautiful not only youthful in appearance, but youthful in heart, and in\r\nthe strength and greatness of her intellect. She loved the emperor as\r\nfondly as she had done twenty-eight years before, and each of her ten\r\nliving children was as dear to her maternal heart as if each had been an\r\nonly child.\r\n\r\nShe had arrayed herself with unusual magnificence to celebrate the entry\r\nof the newly-married couple into Vienna. The imperial cortege was to\r\nstop at the cathedral of St. Stephen, there to witness the bridals of\r\ntwenty-five young couples, all of whom the empress had dowered in honor\r\nof her son's second marriage.\r\n\r\n\"Surely the prayers of these fifty lovers will bring happiness upon the\r\nheads of my son and his wife,\" said the empress to herself. \"They need\r\nprayers indeed, for poor Josepha is very unlike our peerless Isabella,\r\nand I fear she will not be attractive enough to cause the dead to be\r\nforgotten. Still, she seems mild and kind-hearted, and I have already\r\nread in her eyes that she is in love with Joseph. I hope this will lead\r\nhim to love her in return. Sometimes a man will love a woman through\r\npity, afterward through habit.\"\r\n\r\nA nervous and impatient knock at her door interrupted the current of the\r\nempress's thoughts; the door was flung open without further ceremony,\r\nand the King of Rome entered the room. He was pale and agitated, and to\r\nhis mother's affectionate welcome he replied by a deep inclination of\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\nThe empress perceived at once that something was wrong, and her heart\r\nbeat rapidly.\r\n\r\n\"My dear boy,\" said she, \"you do not wear a holiday face, and your young\r\nbride--\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no bride,\" interrupted Joseph, angrily. \"I have come to beg of\r\nyour majesty to discontinue these rejoicings, or at least to excuse me\r\nfrom appearing in public at the side of the Princess of Bavaria. She is\r\nnot my wife, nor ever shall be!\"\r\n\r\n\"What means this?\" stammered the empress, bewildered.\r\n\r\n\"It means that my marriage is null and void; and that no human power\r\nshall force me to be husband of a creature tainted with leprosy.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress uttered a cry of horror.\r\n\r\n\"My son, my son!\" exclaimed she, \"what unheard of charge is this!\"\r\n\r\n\"A charge which is a miserable truth, your majesty. Do you not remember\r\nto have heard that the natural son of Charles of Bavaria had died, not\r\nlong ago, of leprosy which he had contracted during a journey to the\r\nEast? Well, his tender and self-sacrificing half-sister volunteered to\r\nnurse him, and was with him until he died. Your majesty, no doubt, will\r\nlook upon this as something very fine and Christian-like. I, on the\r\ncontrary, would have found it more honorable, if the princess had\r\nadvised us of the legacy she wears upon her back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Woe to her and to the house of Bavaria, if you speak the truth, my\r\nson!\" cried the empress, indignantly.\r\n\r\n\"If your majesty will send Van Swieten to her, you may convince yourself\r\nof the fact.\"\r\n\r\nA few moments later Van Swieten entered the room. His fame was European.\r\nHe was well known as a man of great skill and science; added to this,\r\nhis noble frankness and high moral worth had greatly endeared him to the\r\nimperial family. Maria Theresa went hastily forward to meet him.\r\n\r\n\"Van Swieten,\" said she, with a voice trembling from agitation, \"you\r\nhave been our friend in many an hour of sorrow, and many a secret of the\r\nhouse of Hapsburg has been faithfully buried in your loyal heart. Help\r\nme again, and, above all, let it he in secrecy. The King of Rome says\r\nfearful things of his wife. I will not believe them until I hear your\r\nverdict. Go at once, I implore you, to the princess, and command her, in\r\nmy name, to declare her malady.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, your majesty, she has not called for my advice,\" replied Van\r\nSwieten, with surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Then she must take it unasked,\" said the empress. \"The princess will\r\nreceive you, and you will know how to win her to reveal her condition.\r\nAs soon as you leave her, return to me.\"\r\n\r\nVan Swieten bowed and left the room. The empress and her son remained\r\ntogether. Neither spoke a word. The King of Rome stood in the embrasure\r\nof a window, looking sullenly up at the sky. The empress walked\r\nhurriedly to and fro, careless that her violent motions were filling her\r\ndress with the gold powder that fell from her head like little showers\r\nof stars.\r\n\r\n\"Christina, was right to warn me,\" said she, after a long pause. \"I\r\nnever should have consented to this alliance with the daughter of my\r\nenemy. It is of no use to patch up old enmities. Charles was humbled and\r\ndefeated by me, and now comes this Josepha, to revenge her father's\r\nlosses, and to bring sorrow to my child. Oh, my son, why did you not\r\nallow my counsel, and marry the Princess of Saxony? But it is useless to\r\nreproach you. The evil is done--let us consult together how best we may\r\nbear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all!\" cried Joseph.\" We must consult how we may soonest cast it\r\naway from us. Your majesty will never require of me the sacrifice of\r\nremaining bound to that woman. I obeyed your behest; and in spite of my\r\ndisinclination to a second marriage, I bent my will before the\r\nnecessities of diplomacy, and the command of my sovereign. But we are\r\nnow on a ground where the duty of a subject ends, and the honor of a man\r\nstands preeminent. I never will consent to be the husband of this woman\r\nwhose person is disgusting to me. Far above all claims of political\r\nexpediency, I hold my right as a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you hold them with unbecoming language,\" replied the empress, who\r\ndid not at all relish the tone of the King of Rome. \"And let me tell\r\nyou, my royal son, that an upright and honorable prince thinks less of\r\nhis rights as a man than of his duties as a ruler. He strives, while a\r\nprince, to be a man; and while a man, to sacrifice his inclinations to\r\nthe calls of a princely station.\"\r\n\r\n\"But not his personal honor,\" cried Joseph. \"Your majesty's code is that\r\nof Macchiavelli, who counsels a prince never to let his feelings as a\r\nman interfere with his policy as a ruler.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress was about to make an angry rejoinder to this remark, when\r\nthe door opened, and Van Swieten reappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said the empress, \"did you see her, Van Swieten?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty,\" replied Van Swieten, with emphasis, \"I have seen\r\nthe Queen of Rome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say that she has no disease that unfits her to be the\r\nwife of the King of Rome?\" asked Maria Theresa.\r\n\r\n\"Her only malady is a cutaneous one, which in a short time will be\r\ncompletely cured. Some persons are so happily organized that they throw\r\noff disease, even when in contact with it. The princess possesses this\r\nsound and healthy organization The poison which she inhaled by her\r\nbrother's bedside, has settled upon her skin in a harmless eruption--her\r\nconstitution is untouched. In a few weeks all trace of it will\r\ndisappear, and nothing will remain to remind us of her noble disregard\r\nof self, save the memory of her heroism and magnanimity. For, indeed,\r\nyour majesty, it is easier to confront death on the battle-field than to\r\nface it in the pestiferous atmosphere of a sick-room. \"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa turned with a radiant smile toward her son. \"You see, my\r\nson \"said she,\" that you have done injustice to your noble wife. Go,\r\nthen, and entreat her forgiveness.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty,\" said a soft voice behind them, \"it is for me to\r\nimplore my husband's forgiveness.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress turned and beheld her daughter-in-law, splendidly attired,\r\nbut pale and wan with unmistakable grief.\r\n\r\n\"Josepha, how came you hither?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"I followed Herr van Swieten,\" replied Josepha. \"He told me that your\r\nmajesty and the King of Rome were here, awaiting his verdict, and I\r\njudged from his manner that it would be in my favor. Therefore I came,\r\nand having heard his flattering words, which I do not deserve, I am here\r\nto inculpate myself. No, Herr van Swieten, if there were any merit in\r\nsuffering for a brother whom I dearly loved, it would all be effaced by\r\nthe wrong which I have done to the King of Rome. I feel that I was\r\nguilty in not confiding my malady to your majesty, and I bow my head\r\nbefore the justice of my punishment, severe though it maybe.\"\r\n\r\n\"It shall not be severe, my daughter,\" said the empress, whose kind\r\nheart was completely overcome by Josepha's humility--\"I, for my part,\r\nforgive you; you are already sufficiently punished.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank your majesty,\" returned Josepha, kissing her outstretched hand.\r\n\"It is easy for one so magnanimous, to pardon the guilty; but my\r\nhusband, will he also forgive me?\"\r\n\r\nShe turned her pale and imploring face toward Joseph, who, with his arms\r\ncrossed, looked scornfully back.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said she sadly, \"no. To obtain his forgiveness, I must make a full\r\nconfession of my fault.\"\r\n\r\nShe approached the window, but her head was cast down so that she did\r\nnot see with what a look of hate Joseph beheld her advancing toward him.\r\n\r\n\"To obtain your pardon, sire,\" said she, \"I must say why I deceived you.\r\nIt was because I preferred perjury to the loss of my earthly\r\nhappiness--the unspeakable happiness of being your wife. I was afraid of\r\nlosing my treasure. For I love you beyond all power of expression; from\r\nthe first moment of our meeting, I have loved you, and this love which,\r\nthanks to Almighty God, I have a right to avow before the world--this\r\nlove it was that misled me. Oh, my husband, have mercy, and forgive the\r\nfault that was born of my excessive love for you. A whole life of love\r\nand obedience shall atone for my sin. Forgive me, forgive me, for the\r\nsake of my love!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, overwhelmed by her grief, the princess knelt at the feet of her\r\nhusband, and raised her hands in supplication for pardon.\r\n\r\nThe empress looked on with sympathetic heart and tearful eyes; she\r\nexpected at every moment to see Joseph raise up his wife, and press her\r\nto his heart for her touching avowal of love. She expected to hear HIM\r\nimplore forgiveness; but she was sadly mistaken.\r\n\r\nJoseph stood immovable, his eyes flashing scorn and fury at the kneeling\r\nprinces before him.\r\n\r\nThis outraged all the pride of Maria Theresa's womanhood. Hastily\r\napproaching Josepha, and stretching her arms toward her, she said: \"If\r\nJoseph has no mercy in his obdurate heart, I at least will not witness\r\nsuch humiliation on the part of his wife. Rise, my daughter, and take\r\nshelter under my love; I will not suffer you to be oppressed--not even\r\nby my own son.\"\r\n\r\nShe would have raised Josepha, but the poor girl waved her gently back.\r\n\"No, dear lady,\" said she, sobbing, \"let me remain until he forgives\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let her remain, your majesty,\" cried Joseph with a burst of wrath, \"she\r\nis in her proper place. But if she means to kneel until she has obtained\r\nmy forgiveness, let her kneel throughout all eternity! I consented to\r\nthis marriage for expediency's sake, and I would have done my best to\r\nmake the burden as light for us both as lay in my power. Your majesty\r\nknows how she has deceived me; you have heard her pitiful lie with its\r\npitiful excuse. I might have forgiven her for marrying me, with her\r\ndisgusting disease, but for being a liar--never!\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough,\" cried the empress, as much excited by her son's obduracy as by\r\nJosepha's touching confession. \"This scene must end, and so help me God,\r\nit shall never be enacted a second time! You are bound to one another\r\nfor life, and together you shall remain. Each mortal has his weight of\r\ngrief to bear. Bear yours in silence, and bear it as becomes your\r\ndignity and station. Have the manliness to smile before the world, my\r\nson, as beseems a prince who has more regard for his princely duties\r\nthan for his rights as a man to happiness.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with that imposing grandeur which Maria Theresa knew so well how to\r\nassume, she continued: \"Rise, Queen of Rome, and never again forget\r\neither your own royal station or the dignity of your womanhood. Give her\r\nyour hand, my son; if you will not love, you must at least honor and\r\nrespect your wife. The bells of Vienna even now are pealing your\r\nwelcome; the people await their sovereigns, and it does not become us to\r\nkeep them in suspense on such an occasion as this.\"\r\n\r\nWithout looking back to see the effect of her words, the empress left\r\nthe room, and called to her pages to fling wide the palace doors.\r\n\r\n\"Apprise the court that we are ready to move,\" said she, in a commanding\r\nvoice, \"and let the carriages approach.\"\r\n\r\nThe pages threw open the wide doors; the emperor and the archduchesses\r\nentered, and following them came the courtiers and ladies of the\r\nimperial household in all the splendor of flashing jewels and costly\r\nrobes.\r\n\r\nThe empress, with unruffled serenity, advanced to meet them. Not once\r\nwere her eyes cast behind toward the unhappy couple, whom she knew\r\nperfectly well had yielded to the force of circumstances, and were\r\nalready throwing the veil of etiquette and courtly decorum over their\r\nbleeding hearts.\r\n\r\nAn hour later the imperial family made its entry into Vienna. In her\r\ngilded state-carriage sat the proud and beautiful empress, and at her\r\nside was the pale Queen of Rome. On either side of the carriage rode the\r\ntwo husbands, the Emperor Francis of Lorraine and the King of Rome. The\r\npeople once more shouted for joy, wishing long life to the imperial\r\npair, and joy to the newly-married couple. From one side to another the\r\nempress and the queen bowed and smiled to all, while the King of Rome\r\nthanked the enraptured Viennese for their welcome. On this clay appeared\r\na new color in Vienna, so called in honor of Joseph's deep-blue eyes; it\r\nwas called \"imperial blue.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the bells chimed; the cannon roared; while in the cathedral the\r\nfifty lovers awaited the King and Queen of Rome, whose marriage filled\r\nall hearts with joy, and seemed to realize every dream of happiness on\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nA STATESMAN'S HOURS OF DALLIANCE.\r\n\r\n\"Are there many people in the anteroom?\" asked Prince Kaunitz of the\r\nstate referendarius, Baron Binder.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your highness,\" returned Binder, \"all waiting impatiently for your\r\nappearance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let them wait, the stupid, strutting representatives of littleness! The\r\nmore insignificant the petty masters, the more conceited are the petty\r\nambassadors. I have no time to see them to-day. We are at peace with the\r\nwhole world, and our only diplomacy regards marrying and giving in\r\nmarriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"So far you have nothing to boast or in that line,\" said Binder,\r\nlaughing. \"There are all sorts of stories afloat about the unhappy\r\nmarriage of the King of Rome. Sorne go so far as to say that he shows\r\nhis dislike in public.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! what matters it whether a prince is a happy husband or not? When a\r\nking sets up pretensions to conjugal felicity, he is either an egotist\r\nor a fool. If the King of Rome cannot love his good, stupid, ugly wife,\r\nhe can make love to the dowry she brings him. A goodly inheritance comes\r\nwith her; what matters it if a woman be thrown into the bargain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, prince, a woman is sometimes harder to conquer than a province; and\r\nI think the King of Rome would much rather have won his Bavaria with the\r\nsword.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he is a blockhead full of sublime nonsense, who mistakes his\r\nlove of novelty for wisdom. He would break his head against a wall, this\r\nobstinate King of Rome, while I crept safely through a mouse-hole. Walls\r\nare not so easily battered down as he supposes; but mouse-holes abound\r\neverywhere, as this sapient king will find out some of these days. It\r\nwas much easier for us to creep into Bavaria with the help of the lovely\r\nJosepha, than to flourish our sword in her brother's face. He has not\r\nlong to live, and we shall come peacefully in possession of his fair\r\nprovince.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or rather, the war for its possession will be waged in the king's\r\nprivate apartments.\"\r\n\r\n\"On that silly subject again!\" exclaimed Kaunitz, impatiently. \"If your\r\nheart bleeds so freely for the sentimental sorrows of the King of Rome,\r\nyou may have another opportunity for your sensibilities in the marriage\r\nof his brother Leopold; for I assure you that his intended is not one\r\nwhit handsomer, or more intelligent, than Josepha of Bavaria. So you see\r\nthat the King of Rome will not be apt to envy his brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your highness is to escort the Infanta of Spain to Innspruck?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I, indeed; that honor I do not confer upon insignificant princesses\r\nwho are nothing but grand-duchesses elect. I go to Innspruck one day\r\nsooner than the imperial family, to inspect the preparations for the\r\nfestivities, and then I shall go as far as the gates of Innspruck--no\r\nfarther, to receive Donna Maria Louisa.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the reason why your levee is so crowded to-day,\" replied Binder\r\nlaughing. \"The foreign ministers wish to take leave of their master. And\r\nnow they have waited long enough for you, prince.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not see one of them. Austria, thanks to me, is now so powerful\r\nthat I need give myself no concern to soothe the anger of a dozen petty\r\nenvoys, and to-day there are none other in the anteroom.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Dutch and Saxon ministers,\" urged Binder.\r\n\r\n\"Little nobodies,\" said Kaunitz, with a shrug. \"I will not see them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, indeed, you presume too much upon their littleness. Only yesterday\r\nyou invited the Hessian ambassador to dine, and then you sat down to\r\ntable without him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was three minutes behind the time. And do you imagine that Prince\r\nKaunitz waits for a poor little Hessian envoy? I did it on purpose to\r\nteach him punctuality.\"\r\n\r\nHere the prince rang a bell, and ordered a page to dismiss the gentlemen\r\nin the anteroom. [Footnote: Report of the Prussian ambassador Baron\r\nFurst to Frederick II.]\r\n\r\nBaron Binder looked after the page and shook his head. Kaunitz smiled.\r\n\"Enough of ambassadors for to-day. The ship of Austria lies proudly and\r\nsafely in the haven of her own greatness; and would you deprive the\r\npilot of a few hours of relaxation? I shall have to take the helm again\r\nto-morrow, when I go to Innspruck, and do you grumble if for a few hours\r\nI enjoy life to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was not aware that dismissing one's visitors was a way to enjoy\r\nlife,\" said Binder.\r\n\r\n\"I do not mean that, you old pedant. Do you hear that tapping at the\r\ndoor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I hear it. It is from the little private door that leads to the\r\ncorridor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that corridor, as you know, leads to a side-entrance of the\r\npalace, and if you look out of the window you will see there the\r\nequipage of the handsomest, frailest, and most fascinating actress in\r\nall Vienna--the equipage of the divine Foliazzi. Hear how the knocking\r\ngrows louder. My charmer becomes impatient.\"\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to retire, then,\" said Binder, \"and leave the field to the\r\nprima donna.\" As he left the room, he muttered: \"If Kaunitz were not a\r\ngreat statesman, he would be a ridiculous old fop!\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz listened with perfect a unconcern to the repeated knocking of\r\nhis charmer until Binder was out of of sight, then he walked up to the\r\nlooking-glass, smoothed his locks, straightened his ruffles, and drew\r\nthe bolt of the door. The beautiful Foliazzi, in a coquettish and most\r\nbecoming morning-costume, radiant with smiles and beauty, entered the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nKaunitz greeted her coldly, and answered her rapturous salutation by a\r\nfaint nod. \"Your impatience is very annoying, Olympia,\" said he; \"you\r\nbeat upon my door like a drum-major.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your highness, it is the impatience of a longing heart,\" said the\r\nsinger. \"Do you know that it seems to me a thousand years since last I\r\nwas allowed to enter these gates of Paradise! For eight days I have been\r\nplunged in deepest sorrow, watching your carriage as it passed by my\r\nhouse, snatching every note from my footman's hands in the hope that it\r\nmight be one from you--hoping in vain, and at last yielded myself up to\r\nfell despair.\"\r\n\r\n\"You express yourself warmly,\" said Kaunitz, umnoved.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed; for a feeling heart always finds strong expression,\"\r\nanswered the signora, showing a row of teeth between her rosy lips that\r\nlooked like precious pearls. \"And now my adored reprobate, why have you\r\nbanished me from your presence for an eternity? Which of my two enemies\r\nhave prevailed against me, politics or the Countess Clary? Justify\r\nyourself, unkind but beloved prince; say that you have not deceived me,\r\nfor my heart yearns to forgive you?\"\r\n\r\nShe came very, very near, and with her bewitching smiles looked up into\r\nKaunitz's face.\r\n\r\nKaunitz bent to receive the caress, and laid his hand fondly upon her\r\nraven black hair. \"Is it true that you have longed for me--very true\r\nindeed?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"I never knew how dear you were to me until I had endured the\r\nintolerable pangs of your absence,\" replied Foliazzi, leaning her head\r\nupon the prince's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"You love me, then, Olympia? Tell me, dearest, tell me truly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Unjust! You ask me such a question!\" cried the signora, putting her\r\narms around the prince's neck. \"If I love you? Do you not feel it in\r\nevery pulsation of my heart? do you not read it in every glance of my\r\neyes? Can you not FEEL that my only thought is of you--my only life,\r\nyour love?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am really glad to hear it,\" said Kaunitz, with statue-like\r\ntranquillity. \"And now I will tell you why I have not sent for you this\r\npast week. It was that I might not interrupt your tender interviews with\r\nCount Palffy, nor frighten away the poor enamoured fool from the snares\r\nyou were laying for him.\"\r\n\r\nThe signora looked perfectly astounded. \"But surely,\" stammered she,\r\n\"your highness does not believe--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no! I believe nothing; I know that the Olympia who loves me so\r\npassionately, has been for two days the fair friend of the young, rich,\r\nand prodigal Count Palffy.\"\r\n\r\nHere the signora laughed outright. \"But, your highness, if you knew\r\nthis, why did you not stop me in my protestations, and tell me so?\"\r\n\r\n\"I only wanted to see whether, really, you were a finished actress. I\r\ncongratulate you, Olympia; I could not have done it better myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prince,\" said the signora, seriously, \"I learned the whole of this\r\nscene from yourself; and in my relations with you I have followed the\r\nexample you gave me. While you swore eternal love to me, you were making\r\ndeclarations to the Countess Clary. Oh, my lord, I have suffered at your\r\nhands, and the whole world sympathizes with my disappointment! The whole\r\nworld knows of your double dealings with women, and calls you a\r\nheartless young libertine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it?\" cried Kaunitz, for a moment forgetting his coldness, and\r\nshowing his satisfaction in his face. \"Does it, indeed, call me a\r\nheartless young libertine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the signora, who seemed not to see his gratification.\r\n\"And when people see a man who is adored by women, and is false to them\r\nall, they say, 'He is a little Kaunitz.'\"\r\n\r\nWhen the signora said this, Kaunitz did what he had not done for years,\r\nhe broke out into a laugh, repeating triumphantly, \"A little Kaunitz.\r\nBut mark you,\" continued he, \"other libertines are called little\r\nKaunitzes, but I alone am the great Kaunitz.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" sighed the signora, \"and this great Kaunitz it is who has\r\nabandoned me. While I worshipped the air he breathed, he sat at the feet\r\nof the Countess Clary, repeating to her the self-same protestations with\r\nwhich an hour before he had intoxicated my senses. Oh, when I heard\r\nthis, jealousy and despair took possession of my soul. I was resolved to\r\nbe revenged, and so I permitted the advances of Count Palffy. Ha! while\r\nI endured his presence, I felt that my heart was wholly and forever\r\nyours! Oh, my adored, my great Kaunitz, say that you love me, and at\r\nyour feet I throw all the lesser Kaunitzes in token of my fealty!\"\r\n\r\nThe signora would have flung her arms around him, but Kaunitz with a\r\ncommanding gesture waved her off.\r\n\r\n\"Very well done, Olympia,\" said he, nodding his head. \"You are as\r\naccomplished as you are beautiful; and well I understand how it is that\r\nyou infatuate by your charms all manner of little Kaunitzes. But now\r\nlisten to Kaunitz the great. I not only allow, but order you to continue\r\nyour intrigue with Count Palffy. Take every thing he offers; wring his\r\npurse dry; and the sooner you ruin him the better.\"\r\n\r\n\"That means that I importune you with my love. Farewell, prince, and may\r\nyou never repent of your cruelty to poor Olympia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay,\" said Kaunitz, coolly. \"I have not done with you. Continue your\r\namours with the Hungarian, and love him as much as you choose,\r\nprovided--\"\r\n\r\n\"Provided?\" echoed the singer anxiously, as Kaunitz paused.\r\n\r\n\"Provided you affect before the world to be still my mistress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my beloved prince,\" cried Foliazzi, \"you will not cast me off!\" and\r\nin spite of his disinclination she folded Kaunitz to her heart.\r\n\r\nThe prince struggled to get free. \"You have disarranged my whole dress,\"\r\nsaid he, peevishly. \"On account of your folly I shall have to make my\r\ntoilet again. Hear me, and let me alone. I said that you would AFFECT to\r\nbe my mistress. To this end you will drive as usual to the side-door by\r\nwhich you have been accustomed to enter the palace, and while your\r\ncarriage stands there for one hour, you shall be treated to a costly\r\nbreakfast in my little boudoir every morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"By your side, my own prince?\"\r\n\r\n\"By yourself, my own Olympia. I have not time to devote an hour to you\r\nevery day. Your carriage shall stand at my door in the morning. Every\r\nevening mine will be for an hour before yours, and while it remains\r\nthere I forbid you to be at home to any one whatsoever.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall think of nothing but you until that hour,\" said the signora,\r\nfondly.\r\n\r\n\"Vraiment, you are very presuming to suppose that I shall trouble myself\r\nto come in the carriage,\" replied Kaunitz, contemptuously. \"It is enough\r\nthat the coach being there, the world will suppose that I am there also.\r\nA man of fashion must have the name of possessing a mistress; but a\r\nstatesman cannot waste his valuable time on women. You are my mistress,\r\nostensibly, and therefore I give you a year's salary of four thousand\r\nguilders.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are an angel--a god!\" cried La Foliazzi, this time with genuine\r\nrapture. \"You come upon one like Jupiter, in a shower of gold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I have no wish to fall into the embraces of my Danae. Now,\r\nhear my last words. If you ever dare let it transpire that you are not\r\nreally my mistress, I shall punish you severely. I will not only stop\r\nyour salary, but I will cite you before the committee of morals, and you\r\nshall be forced into a marriage with somebody.\"\r\n\r\nThe singer shuddered and drew back. \"Let me go at once into my boudoir.\r\nIs my breakfast ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--your morning visits there begin to-morrow. Now go home to Count\r\nPalffy, and do not forget our contract.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not forget it, prince,\" replied the signora, smiling. \"I await\r\nyour coach this evening. You may kiss me if you choose.\"\r\n\r\nShe bent her head to his and held out her delicate cheek, fresh as a\r\nrose.\r\n\r\n\"Simpleton,\" said he, slightly tapping her beautiful mouth, \"do you\r\nsuppose that the great Kaunitz would kiss any lips but those which, like\r\nthe sensitive mimosa, shrink from the touch of man Go away. Count Palffy\r\nwill feel honored to reap the kisses I have left.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave her his hand, and looked after her, as with light and graceful\r\ncarriage she left the room.\r\n\r\n\"She is surpassingly beautiful,\" said Kaunitz to himself. \"Every one\r\nenvies me; but each one thinks it quite a matter of course that the\r\nloveliest woman in Vienna should be glad to be my mistress. Ah! two\r\no'clock. My guests await me. But before I go I must bring down the\r\nCountess Clary from the airy heaven which she has built for herself.\"\r\n\r\nHe rang, and a page appeared; for from the time he became a prince,\r\nKaunitz introduced four pages in his household, and kept open table\r\ndaily for twelve persons.\r\n\r\n\"Tell the Countess Clary,\" said he, \"that in a few moments I will\r\nconduct her to the dining-room. Then await me in my puderkammer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nPRINCE KAUNITZ AND RITTER GLUCK.\r\n\r\nPrince Kaunitz had finished his promenade in the powder-room, and having\r\nascertained by means of his mirror that his peruke was in order, he\r\nbetook himself to the apartments of the Countess Clary, to conduct her\r\nto table.\r\n\r\nThe young countess, Kaunitz's niece, and a widow scarcely thirty years\r\nof age, flew to greet her uncle, radiant with smiles and happiness.\r\n\r\n\"What an unexpected honor you confer upon me, my dear uncle!\" said she,\r\nwith her sweet low voice. \"Coming yourself to conduct me to the table!\r\nHow I thank you for preparing me a triumph which every woman in Vienna\r\nwill envy me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I came with no intention whatever of preparing you a triumph or a\r\npleasure. I came solely because I wish to have a few words with you\r\nbefore we go to dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am all ears, your highness,\" said the countess, smiling.\r\n\r\nKaunitz looked at his young and lovely niece with uncommon scrutiny.\r\n\"You have been crying,\" said he, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed,\" said she, blushing.\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose that you can deceive me? I repeat it, you have been\r\ncrying. Will you presume to contradict me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, dear uncle, I will not.\"\r\n\r\n\"And wherefore? No prevarication; I must know.\"\r\n\r\nThe young countess raised her soft blue eyes to the face of the haughty\r\nprince. \"I will tell the truth,\" said she, again blushing. \"I was crying\r\nbecause La Foliazzi was so long with you to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jealous, too!\" said Kaunitz, with a sneer. \"And pray, who ever gave\r\nyou the right of being jealous of me?\"\r\n\r\nThe countess said nothing, but her eyes filled with tears.\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to discuss this matter with you. I came for this purpose. Our\r\nrelations must be distinctly understood if they are to last. You must\r\nhave the goodness to remember their origin. When you were left a widow\r\nyou turned to me, as your nearest relative, for assistance. You were\r\nunprotected, and your husband had left you nothing. I gave you my\r\nprotection, not because I was in any way pleased with you, but because\r\nyou were my sister's child. I invited you hither to do the honors of my\r\nhouse, to give orders to the cooks and steward, to overlook my household\r\narrangements, and to receive my guests in a manner worthy of their host.\r\nTo insure you the appearance and consideration due to you as my niece\r\nand as the lady of my house, I gave you a remuneration of two thousand\r\nguilders a year. Were not these my terms?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your highness, they were. They filled me with gratitude and joy;\r\nand never will I forget your kindness.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems, however, that you do forget it,\" replied the heartless uncle.\r\n\"How does it happen that you take the liberty of being unhappy because\r\nLa Foliazzi is in my room! What business is it of yours, whom I receive\r\nor entertain? Have I ever given you the slightest hope that from my\r\nniece I would ever raise you to the eminence of being my wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never, never, dear uncle,\" said the countess, scarlet with shame. \"You\r\nhave never been otherwise to me than my generous benefactor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then oblige me by silencing the absurd rumors that may have led you\r\ninto the delusion of supposing that I intended to make of you a\r\nprincess. I wish you to know that I have no idea of marrying again; and\r\nif ever I should form another matrimonial alliance, it will either be\r\nwith an imperial or a royal princes. Will you be so good as to remember\r\nthis and to act accordingly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied the countess, her eyes filling with tears. \"I\r\nassure your highness that I have never been so presuming as to regard\r\nyou otherwise than as my kinsman and guardian. My feelings of admiration\r\nfor you are indeed enthusiastic; but I have never felt any thing toward\r\nyou but the attachment of a daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray do not trouble yourself to feel any thing at all on my account,\"\r\nsaid Kaunitz, ill-humoredly. \"I am not under the necessity of playing\r\nthe part of a tender father toward you; therefore, dry up the tears you\r\ntook the trouble to shed on La Foliazzi's account. But enough of this\r\nfolly. I hope that we understand each other, and that I will not have to\r\nrepeat this conversation. Be so good as to take my arm. We will go\r\nforward to meet our guests.\"\r\n\r\nThe young countess took the arm of the prince, and they entered the\r\ndrawing-room. The guests had long been assembled there, but it never\r\noccurred to Kaunitz to make any apology for his late appearance.\r\nNevertheless, his guests were all noble; some of them representatives of\r\nprincely houses or powerful kingdoms. Kaunitz, however, was not only the\r\nall-powerful minister of Maria Theresa; it was well known that his\r\nslender, diamond-studded fingers directed the policy of all Europe. No\r\none in that room had the courage to resent his rudeness. All seemed to\r\nfeel honored as he walked haughtily forward with a slight inclination of\r\nhis head to the many, and a condescending smile to the few whom it\r\npleased him to distinguish by his notice. [Footnote: Wraxall, \"Memoirs,\"\r\nvol. i., page 380.]\r\n\r\nPrince Kaunitz did not choose to perceive that several distinguished\r\nambassadors, as well as a German prince, himself a reigning sovereign,\r\nwere present as his guests. He passed them all by to accost a small,\r\ngraceful man who, seated in a recess, had received no further attention\r\nfrom the high-born company than a condescending nod. Kaunitz gave him\r\nhis hand, and welcomed him audibly. The honored guest was Noverre, the\r\ninventor of the ballet as it is performed to-day on the stage. Noverre\r\nblushed with pleasure at the reception given him, while the other guests\r\nscarcely concealed their chagrin.\r\n\r\nJust then the folding-doors were thrown wide open, and the steward\r\nannounced in a loud voice that the table of his lord the prince was\r\nserved. The company arose, and the ladies looked to see which of them\r\nwas to have the honor of being conducted to the table by the host.\r\nKaunitz feigned neither to see nor to hear. He continued his\r\nconversation with Noverre, and when he had quite done, he sauntered\r\ncarelessly up to his other guests. Suddenly he paused, and his eyes\r\nwandered from one to another with a searching glance.\r\n\r\n\"Good Heaven!\" exclaimed he, \"of what a rudeness we were about to be\r\nguilty. I had invited Ritter Gluck to meet us to-day, and he has not yet\r\narrived. It shall not be said of me that I was ever wanting in respect\r\nto genius as transcendent as his. I must beg of my distinguished guests\r\nto await his arrival before going to dinner.\" [Footnote: Swinburne, vol.\r\nI., page 80.]\r\n\r\nHereupon he resumed his conversation with Noverre. The other guests\r\nwere indignant, for they all felt the insult. The nobles disapproved of\r\nthe fashion, which had been introduced by Kaunitz, of mingling artists\r\nand savans of no birth with the aristocracy of Vienna; and the\r\nambassadors felt it as a personal injury that Kaunitz, who yesterday had\r\nrefused to wait for them, to-day called upon them to wait for a\r\nmusician.\r\n\r\nKaunitz pretended not to see the displeasure which, nevertheless, his\r\nguests were at no great pains to conceal, and he went on talking in an\r\nanimated strain with Noverre. The poor dancer, meanwhile, gave short and\r\nembarrassed answers. He had remarked the discontent of the company, and\r\nthe prince's over-politeness oppressed him, the more so as he perceived\r\none of the lords gradually approaching with the intention of addressing\r\nthe prince. With the deepest respect the dancer attempted to withdraw,\r\nbut the merciless Kaunitz caught him by one of the buttons of his velvet\r\ncoat, and held him fast.\r\n\r\n\"Do not stir,\" said the prince. \"I see the duke quite as well as you do,\r\nbut he is a liar and a braggart--I dislike him, and he shall not speak\r\nwith me. Tell me something about the new ballet that you are arranging\r\nfor the emperor's festival. I hear that Gluck has composed the music.\r\nBut hush! Here comes the maestro.\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz walked rapidly forward and met Gluck in the middle of the room.\r\nThey greeted one another cordially, but proudly--as two princes might\r\nhave done. Around them stood the other guests, frowning to see these two\r\nmen, both so proud, so conscious of greatness, scarcely seeming aware\r\nthat others besides themselves were present. Gluck was in full\r\ncourt-dress; at his side a sword; on his breast the brilliant order of\r\nthe pope. With unembarrassed courtesy he received the greeting of the\r\nprince, and made no apology for his tardy appearance.\r\n\r\n\"Thank Heaven, you have come at last!\" exclaimed Kaunitz, in an audible\r\nvoice. \"I was afraid that the gods, angels, and spirits who are the\r\ndaily associates of the great maestro would deprive us poor mortals of\r\nthe honor of dining with the favorite of the Muses and the Graces.\"\r\n\r\n\"The gods, the Muses, and the Graces are the associates of Prince\r\nKaunitz,\" returned Gluck. \"If they are not to be found in their temples,\r\nwe may be sure that they have taken refuge here.\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz, who never vouchsafed a civil word in return for compliments,\r\nbowed his head, and with a gratified smile turned to his assembled\r\nguests.\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said he, \"let us sit down to dinner.\"\r\n\r\nBut the company waited for the signal to rise which would be given when\r\nthe host offered his arm to the lady whom he complimented by taking her\r\nin to dinner.\r\n\r\nThe prince looked around, and his eyes rested again on Gluck.\r\n\r\n\"I beg of the Ritter Gluck,\" said he, graciously, \"the honor of\r\nconducting him to the table.\" And with a courteous bow he offered his\r\narm. \"Favorite of the Muses, come with me. I am too true a worshipper of\r\nyour nine lovely mistresses, to resign you to any one else.\"\r\n\r\nGluck, with a smile appreciative of the honor conferred upon him, took\r\nthe arm of the prince, and was led into the dining-room.\r\n\r\nBehind them came the other guests. All wore discontented faces; for this\r\ntime the slight had been offered not only to dukes and ambassadors, but\r\nto the ladies themselves, who could not help feeling bitterly this utter\r\ndisregard of all etiquette and good-breeding.\r\n\r\nOn the day after the dinner Kaunitz started for Innspruck to superintend\r\nthe festivities preparing for the marriage of the Archduke Leopold.\r\nCount Durazzo, the director of the theatre, had preceded the prince by a\r\nweek. Noverre, with his ballet-dancers, was to follow. The great opera\r\nof \"Orpheus and Eurydice,\" whose fame was now European was being\r\nrehearsed at Innspruck, for representation on the first night of the\r\nfestival.\r\n\r\nAlthough Florian Gassman was a leader of acknowledged skill, Gluck, at\r\nthe request of the emperor, had gone to Innspruck to direct and oversee\r\nthe rehearsals.\r\n\r\nThe furies had just concluded their chorus, and Gluck had given the\r\nsignal for dismissal, when Prince Kaunitz entered the theatre, and came\r\nforward, offering his hand to the maestro.\r\n\r\n\"Well, maestro,\" said be, \"are you satisfied with your artistes? Are we\r\nto have a great musical treat to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\nGluck shrugged his shoulders. \"My singers are not the angels who taught\r\nme this music, but for mortals they sing well. I scarcely think that\r\nDonna Maria Louisa has ever heard any thing comparable to the music\r\nwhich is to welcome her to Innspruck.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to hear it,\" said Kaunitz, with his usual composure, although\r\nhe was inwardly annoyed at Gluck's complacency. \"But as I promised the\r\nempress to see and hear every thing myself, I must hear and judge of\r\nyour opera also. Be so good as to have it repeated.\"\r\n\r\nGluck looked at the prince in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"What,\" cried he, \"your highness wishes them to go through the whole\r\nopera without an audience?\"\r\n\r\nPrince Kaunitz raised his lofty head in displeasure, and said: \"Ritter\r\nGluck, quality has always been esteemed before quantity. I alone am an\r\naudience. Let the opera begin, the audience is here.\" [Footnote: The\r\nprince's own words. Swinburne, vol. 1, page 302.]\r\n\r\nGluck did not answer immediately. He frowned and looked down. Suddenly\r\nhe raised his head, and his face wore its usual expression of energy and\r\npower.\r\n\r\n\"I will gratify your highness. I myself would like to hear the opera\r\nwithout participating in it. Ladies and gentlemen of the coulisses, be\r\nso kind as to return! Gentlemen of the orchestra, resume your\r\ninstruments! Gassman, have the goodness to lead. Do your best. Let us\r\nhave your highest interpretation of art--for you have an audience such\r\nas you may never have again. Prince Kaunitz and Ritter Gluck are your\r\nlisteners!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nAN UNFORTUNATE MEETING.\r\n\r\nFestival followed festival. The streets of the beautiful capital of\r\nTyrol were gay with the multitudes who thronged to the marriage of the\r\nempress's second son.\r\n\r\nIt was the second day after the wedding. On the first evening the opera\r\nof \"Orpheus and Eurydice\" had been triumphantly represented before the\r\nelite of the city. A second representation had been called for by the\r\ndelighted audience, although at the imperial palace a magnificent mask\r\nball was to be given, for which two thousand invitations had been\r\nissued. It was a splendid confusion of lights, jewels, velvet, satins,\r\nand flowers. All the nations of the world had met in that imperial\r\nballroom; not only mortals, but fairies, sylphides, and heathen gods and\r\ngoddesses. It was a bewildering scene, that crowd of fantastic\r\nrevellers, whose faces were every one hidden by velvet masks, through\r\nwhich dark eyes glittered, like stars upon the blackness of the night.\r\n\r\nThe imperial family alone appeared without masks. Maria Theresa, in a\r\ndress of blue velvet, studded with golden embroidery, her fair white\r\nforehead encircled by a coronet of diamonds and sapphires, walked\r\namong her guests with enchanting smiles and gracious words. She leaned\r\nupon the arm of the King of Rome, who, looking more cheerful than usual,\r\nchatted gayly with his mother or with the crowd around them. Near them\r\nwere the Grand Duke Leopold and his bride, so absorbed in one another\r\nthat it was easy to see that they at least were happy in their\r\naffections. Behind them flocked the young archduchesses, who were\r\nenjoying the ball to the utmost. Whenever the empress approached a group\r\nof her guests, they stood in respectful silence while she and her\r\nhandsome family passed by: but as soon as she had left them, their\r\nadmiration burst forth in every imaginable form of words. The empress,\r\nwho overheard these murmured plaudits, smiled proudly upon her young\r\ndaughters, who, even if they had been no archduchesses, would still have\r\nbeen the handsomest girls in Austria.\r\n\r\nWhile the empress, in the full splendor of her rank and beauty, was\r\nrepresenting the sovereign of Austria, the emperor, mingling with the\r\nguests, was taking the liberty of amusing himself as ordinary mortals\r\nlove to do at a masked ball. On his arm hung a mask of most graceful\r\nfigure, but so completely was she disguised that nothing could be\r\nascertained with regard to her name or rank. Some whispered that it was\r\nthe emperor's new favorite, the Countess of Auersberg.\r\n\r\nAs the pair went by, the emperor overheard the conjectures of the crowd,\r\nand he turned with a smile to the lady who accompanied him.\r\n\r\n\"Do not fear,\" said he; \"there is no danger of your being recognized.\r\nYou are mistaken for another lady. I promised you that you should meet\r\nJoseph here, and I will keep my promise. Let us try to make our way\r\nthrough the crowd, that we may join him as soon as possible; for I feel\r\noppressed this evening, I know not why.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then, your majesty, let me go back into the anteroom,\" said the\r\nveiled lady. \"I begin to feel all the rashness of my undertaking, and\r\nalthough it has the sanction of your majesty and the empress, I feel\r\nlike a criminal, every moment dreading discovery. Let us go back.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" replied the emperor, \"let us remain until the interview with\r\nJoseph is over. I shall feel no better in the anteroom than here. I\r\nnever shall be well until I leave this beautiful, fearful Tyrol. Its\r\nmountains weigh heavily upon my head and my breast. But let us sit down\r\nawhile. I love to listen to the people's talk, when the court is not\r\nby.\"\r\n\r\n\"But while your majesty is present the court is here,\" said the lady.\r\n\r\n\"Not so, my dear,\" whispered the emperor; \"the empress and my children\r\nare the court, I am but a private nobleman. Ah, there they come! See how\r\nbeautiful and stately the empress looks! Who would suppose that this\r\ngrown-up family were her children!--But she, she signs us to approach.\r\nTake courage, and await me here.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the emperor hastened toward his wife, who received him with a\r\nloving smile of welcome.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my son,\" said she, withdrawing her arm from Joseph, \"I give you\r\nyour freedom. I advise you to mix among the masks, and to go in search\r\nof adventures. We have done enough for ceremony, I think we may now\r\nenjoy ourselves a little like the rest of mankind. If we were younger,\r\nFranzel, we, too, would mix with yonder crowd, and dance awhile. But I\r\nsuppose we must leave that to our children, and betake ourselves to the\r\ncard-table or to the opera-house.\"\r\n\r\n\"If your majesty leaves me the choice,\" said the emperor, \"I vote for\r\nthe opera.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress took his arm, while she turned to the Countess Lerchenfeld,\r\nthe governess of the archduchesses. \"To the dancing-room, countess,\"\r\nsaid she; \"the archduchesses may dance, but no masks must enter the\r\nroom. Now, my dear husband, follow me. Adieu, Joseph! To-morrow I expect\r\nto hear what fortune has befallen you to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty forgets that Fortune is a woman,\" returned Joseph,\r\nsmiling, \"and you know that I have no luck with women.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or you will not have it,\" said the empress, laughing, and leaving her\r\nson to his thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"Or you will not have it,\" repeated a soft voice near, and Joseph,\r\nturning, saw an elegant-looking woman, veiled and masked.\r\n\r\n\"Fair mask,\" said he, smiling, \"although you have the qualities of Echo,\r\nyou have not yet pined away to invisibility.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps, sire, my body is only the coffin of my heart, and my heart the\r\nunfortunate Echo that has grieved herself to death and invisibility. But\r\nperhaps your majesty does not believe in the power of grief, for\r\ndoubtless you are unacquainted with its pangs.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why should you imagine that I am unacquainted with grief?\" asked\r\nJoseph.\r\n\r\n\"Because your majesty's station is exalted above that of other men;\r\nbecause God has blessed you with a noble heart, that is worthy of your\r\ndestiny--the destiny which gives you the power of making other mortals\r\nhappy.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know all this?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see it,\" whispered she, \"in your eyes--those eyes that reflect the\r\nblue of heaven. Oh, sire, may never a cloud darken that heaven!\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you for your pious wish,\" replied the king sadly, \"but if you\r\nare mortal, you know that in this world there are no such things as\r\ncloudless skies. Let us not speak of such serious matters; give me your\r\narm, and let us join in the mirth that is around us.\"\r\n\r\n\"If your majesty will permit me, I will while away the hour by relating\r\nto you a sad story of life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why a sad story, why not a merry one?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I came here for no other object than to relate this sad story\r\nto yourself. I came to crave your majesty's sympathy and clemency in\r\nbehalf of a suffering fellow-creature.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I do any thing in the matter?\" asked the king.\r\n\r\n\"From your majesty alone do I hope for succor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well; if so, let me hear the story. I will listen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, my mournful history will ill accord with the merriment of a\r\nballroom. If you will condescend to go with me to one of the boxes in\r\nthe gallery, I will there confide my secret to your ear, and there I\r\nhope to soften your heart. Oh, sire, do not tarry; it is a case of life\r\nor death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Joseph, after a pause, \"I will go. After all, I am about to\r\nhave an adventure.\"\r\n\r\nThe mask bowed, and made her way through the crowd to a side-door which\r\nopened upon the private staircase leading to the boxes. Joseph looked\r\nwith interest at the light and elegant form that preceded him, and said\r\nto himself, \"Truly an adventure! I will follow it to the end.\"\r\n\r\nThey were now in the galleries, from whence a beautiful view of the\r\nballroom was obtained. The lady entered a box, the king followed. The\r\nsound of the music, and the gay voices of the dancers, came with\r\nsoftened murmur to the ears of the king. He thought of the past, but\r\nrousing himself to the exigencies of the present, he turned to the lady\r\nand said: \"Now, fair mask, to your narrative.\"\r\n\r\n\"Swear first to bear me to the end! Swear it by the memory of Isabella,\r\nwhom you so passionately loved!\"\r\n\r\n\"Isabella!\" cried Joseph, turning pale. \"You are very bold, madame, to\r\ncall that name, and call it here! But speak. By her loved memory I will\r\nlisten.\"\r\n\r\nShe took his hand, and pressed it to her lips. Then she begged the king\r\nto be seated, and took her place by his side.\r\n\r\n\"Sire, I wish to relate to you the history of a woman whom God has\r\neither blessed or cursed; a woman who, if she were not most unfortunate,\r\nwould be the happiest of mortals.\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak as the Sphinx did before the gates of Thebes. How can one be\r\nat the same time blessed and cursed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, it is a blessing to be capable of loving with passion; it is a\r\ncurse to love, and not be loved in return.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a greater curse,\" murmured Joseph, \"to feign love and not to feel\r\nit. I have been a victim of such hypocrisy, and never shall I outlive\r\nits bitter memories.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" began the lady, \"the woman of whom I speak would willingly give\r\na year of her life if the man she loves would but vouchsafe to her\r\nthirsting heart one single glance of love. Think how wretched she must\r\nbe, when even the appearance of love would satisfy her. But do not\r\nsuppose, sire, that this woman is the victim of a guilty passion which\r\nshe dare not own. She is a wife, and the man she adores, and who loves\r\nher not, is her husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why does he not love her?\" asked Joseph quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said the mask, in an agitated voice, \"because she has sinned\r\nagainst him. On the day of her marriage, although he nobly invited her\r\nconfidence, she hid from him a--a--malady. Oh, in mercy, do not go! You\r\nMUST hear me\" cried she; almost frenzied, \"you swore by the memory of\r\nIsabella to listen.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph resumed his seat, and said roughly, \"Go on, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a crime,\" continued she in a voice of deepest emotion, \"but she\r\nhas paid dearly for her sin. Her husband repulsed her, but her heart was\r\nstill his; he despised her, and yet she adores him. Her malady has long\r\nsince disappeared; her heart alone is sick; that heart which will break\r\nif her lord refuse to forgive her the offence that was born of her love\r\nfor him! But oh, sire, he has no pity. When she meets him with imploring\r\nlooks, he turns away; her letters he sends to her unopened. Oh, he is\r\nsevere in his wrath; it is like vengeance from Heaven! But still she\r\nloves, and still she hopes that one day he will be generous, and forgive\r\nher another crime--that of not being blessed with beauty. For months she\r\nhas longed to tell him that she repents of her faults, that her\r\npunishment is just; but, oh! oh! she begs for mercy. She was forbidden\r\nto follow him to Innspruck, but she could not stay behind. His parents\r\ngave their consent, and she is here at your knees, my lord and king, to\r\nplead for mercy. Oh! has there not been enough of cruelty? See me\r\nhumbled at your feet; reach me your beloved hand, and bid me sit by your\r\nside! \"\r\n\r\nShe had sunk to the ground, and now tearing from her face the mask and\r\nveil, the King of Rome beheld the death-like countenance of his despised\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nJoseph rose from his seat and looked at her with inexorable hate.\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" said he, \"thanks to the name which you used to force me into\r\ncompliance, I have heard you out. I married you without affection, and\r\nyou had been my wife but a few short hours when you turned my\r\nindifference into undying hate. You come and whine to me for my love;\r\nand you inform me that you are love sick on my account. If so, I dare\r\nsay that Van Swieten, who cured you of leprosy, can also cure you of\r\nyour unfortunate attachment. If you never knew it before, allow me to\r\ninform you that YOUR love gives you no claim to MINE; and when a woman\r\nhas the indelicacy to thrust herself upon a man who has never sought\r\nher, she must expect to be despised and humbled to the dust. And now,\r\nmadame, as I still have the misfortune to be your husband, listen to my\r\ncommands. You came here in spite of my prohibition; as you pass in the\r\nworld for my wife, you shall at least be obedient to my will. Go back\r\nthis night to Vienna, and never again presume to entrap me into another\r\ninterview like this!\"\r\n\r\nWithout vouchsafing a look at the fainting woman who lay at his feet,\r\nJoseph left the box, and descended to the ballroom. But what wail was\r\nthat, which, coming from the imperial banqueting-hall, hushed every\r\nsound of music and mirth, and drove the gay multitude in terror from the\r\nballroom?\r\n\r\nThe King of Rome was hastily making his way through the terrified crowd,\r\nwhen he was met by one of his own officers.\r\n\r\n\"I have been seeking your majesty,\" said he in a trembling voice. \"The\r\nemperor--\"\r\n\r\n\"In Heaven's name, what of the emperor?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is very ill, your majesty. On leaving the theatre, he was struck\r\ndown by apoplexy.\"\r\n\r\nThe king made no reply. He dashed on from room to room until he reached\r\nhis father's sleeping-apartment.\r\n\r\nAnd there on the bed, that white, motionless body; that cold, insensible\r\npiece of clay; that marble image without breath--was all that earth now\r\nheld of the Emperor Francis of Lorraine. He was dead, and his wish had\r\nbeen granted. He had gone forever from the \"beautiful, fearful Tyrol;\"\r\nand its mountains lay no longer heavily on his breast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nMOURNING.\r\n\r\nThe sound of rejoicings was hushed. The people of Innspruck had hastened\r\nto remove from the streets every symbol of festivity. The flowers and\r\nflags, the triumphal arches, and the wreathed arcades had disappeared.\r\nThe epithalamium had been followed by the dirge.\r\n\r\nNight had set in--the first night of the emperor's death. The corpse\r\nstill lay on the bed where its last breath had been drawn, and no one\r\nwas with the deceased sovereign except two night-watchers, whose drowsy\r\nheads were buried in the arm-chairs wherein they sat. Death had banished\r\nceremony. In the presence of their dead emperor, his attendants were\r\nseated and slept. In the centre of the room stood the coffin that\r\nawaited the imperial remains; for on the morrow the funeral ceremonies\r\nwere to begin. But the empress had ordered that on this night all\r\nceremony should be suspended.\r\n\r\nDeep silence reigned throughout Innspruck. The citizens, worn out with\r\nthe excitement of the day, had all retired to rest. Even the children of\r\nthe deceased had forgotten their sorrow in sleep. Maria Theresa alone\r\nsought no rest.\r\n\r\nAll that day she had been overwhelmed by grief; even prayer seemed to\r\nbring no relief to her heart. But now she was tranquil, she had thrust\r\nback her tears; and the empress-widow, all etiquette forgetting, was\r\nmaking her husband's shroud.\r\n\r\nAs a woman, she grieved for the partner of her joys and sorrows; as a\r\nwoman, she wished to pay the last sad honors to the only man whom she\r\nhad ever loved. She whose hands were accustomed to the sceptre, now held\r\na needle, and to all offers of assistance she made but one reply.\r\n\r\n\"None of you are worthy to help me in this holy work, for none of you\r\nloved him. For you, he was the beneficent and honored sovereign, but for\r\nme, he was the joy, the light, the air of my life. I, who loved him,\r\nhave alone the right to work upon his shroud.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, your majesty,\" cried the Countess Dann, while her eyes filled with\r\nsympathizing tears, \"would that the world could see with what devotion\r\nthe great Maria Theresa sits in the stillness of the night, and with her\r\nown hands prepares her husband's shroud!\"\r\n\r\nThe empress quickly raised her head, and, with something like her\r\naccustomed imperiousness, said: \"I forbid any one of you to speak of\r\nwhat you have seen to-night. In the simplicity of my grief, I do what my\r\nheart urges me to do; but let not my sorrow become the subject of the\r\nworld's idle gossip. When the husband dies his wife, be she empress or\r\nbeggar, is nothing but a sorrowing widow. Ah! I am indeed beggared of\r\nall my wealth, for I have lost the dearest treasure I possessed on\r\nearth. All my joys will die with him.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress's sobs choked her utterance; and burying her face in the\r\nshroud, she wept aloud.\r\n\r\n\"In the name of Heaven, your majesty, do not let your tears fall upon\r\nthe shroud!\" cried the Countess Dann, while she tried with gentle force\r\nto wrest the cloth from the empress's hands. \"I have heard it said that\r\nwhat is laid in the coffin bedewed with tears, draws after it to the\r\ngrave the one who sheds them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would it were true!\" exclaimed the empress, who had already resumed her\r\nwork. \"Would that my Francis could open his arms to receive me, that I\r\nmight rest by his side from the cares of life! Would that I were with\r\nhim, who was my lover from earliest childhood; for cold and cheerless\r\nwill be the life that is no longer lit up by his smile.\"\r\n\r\nShe bent over her work, and nothing further was said; but her ladies of\r\nhonor gazed with tearful eyes upon the high-born mourner, who, in her\r\nlong, black dress, was making a shroud for her lost husband.\r\n\r\nAt last the task was completed, and she rose from her seat. With a sad\r\nsmile she threw the shroud over her head, and it fell around her\r\nmajestic form like a white veil.\r\n\r\n\"My veil of eternal widowhood!\" said she. \"Let me warm it with my love,\r\nthat it may not lie too cold upon my darling's breast. Now, my friends,\r\ngo and rest. Pray for the emperor, and for his heart-broken wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely,\" said the Countess Daun, \"your majesty will not send us away\r\nuntil we have attended to your wants. Let us remain; we will watch by\r\nyour bedside.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, countess, I will dispense with your services to-night. Charlote von\r\nHieronymus will stay with me.\"\r\n\r\nTurning to her beloved little tire-woman she said: \"I want your\r\nattendance yet awhile, Charlotte; you are to dress my hair to-night as\r\nbecomes a widow. Good-night, ladies.\"\r\n\r\nThe ladies of honor, with deep courtesies, left the room. As the door\r\nclosed behind them, she said to Charlotte: \"Now, Charlotte, dear child,\r\nyou shall go with me on my last visit to the emperor. Take a pair of\r\nscissors, and come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Scissors, your majesty?\" said Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dear,\" replied she, as she advanced to her work-table from\r\nwhence she took up a silver candelabrum, and signed to Charlotte to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nWrapping the shroud close about her, the empress went forward through\r\nthe long suite of magnificent but dark and empty rooms, that lay between\r\nher and her husband. Her tall white figure, enveloped in the shroud,\r\nlooked in the gloom of night like a ghost. The light which she carried,\r\nas it flashed across her face gave it a weird aspect; and as the two\r\nwanderers went flitting by the large mirrors that here and there\r\nornamented the rooms, they looked like a vision which had started up for\r\na moment, then vanished into utter darkness.\r\n\r\nAt last they came to a door which stood ajar, through which a light was\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\n\"We are here,\" said the empress, leaning against the door for support.\r\n\"Step lightly, Charlotte, and make no noise, for the emperor sleeps.\"\r\n\r\nThere on the bed, with its yellow, sunken face, was the corpse that had\r\nbeen her husband--the only man she had ever loved. And that hideous\r\nblack coffin, which looked all the gloomier for the wax-lights that\r\nburned around it, was his last resting-place.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa shuddered when she saw all this; but her strong will came\r\nto her help, and she went steadily forward until she reached the\r\nnight-watchers. She awoke them and said, \"Go, wait in the next room\r\nuntil I call you.\" Charlotte was already on her knees, praying.\r\n\r\nThe empress stood once more irresolute, then rushing forward with a cry\r\nshe leaned over the body.\r\n\r\nPresently she laid her hand lovingly upon the staring eyes of the\r\ncorpse, and looked long and tenderly at the face.\r\n\r\n\"Shut your eyes, my Franz,\" said she softly, \"shut your eyes, for never\r\nhave they looked so coldly upon me before. Do not forget me in heaven,\r\nmy beloved; but leave your heart with me; mine has been with you for so\r\nmany years! First I loved you as a child--then as a maiden--and lastly,\r\nI loved you as a wife and the mother of your children. And I will ever\r\nlove you, my own one. I was true as your wife, and I will be true as\r\nyour widow. Farewell, my beloved, farewell!\"\r\n\r\nShe bent over and kissed the emperor's mouth, and for a moment laid her\r\nhead upon his cold, still bosom. Then again she drew her hand softly\r\nacross his eyes, and tried to close them. A proud smile flitted over her\r\nwan face, for the eyes of the corpse closed. The loving hand of the wife\r\nhad prevailed where every other effort had failed. True to her wishes in\r\ndeath as in life, the dead emperor had shut his eyes to earth forever.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Charlotte, come,\" cried the empress, almost joyfully, \"see how my\r\nemperor loves me! He hears me still, and has granted my last request. I\r\nwill mourn no more, but will think of the day when I shall go to him\r\nagain and share his home in heaven. Until then, my Franz, farewell!\"\r\n\r\nShe bent her head, and taking the shroud from her shoulders, she spread\r\nit carefully over the coffin, smoothing every wrinkle with her hands,\r\nuntil it lay as perfect as the covering of a couch.\r\n\r\n\"Call the valets, Charlotte,\" said she; and as they entered the room,\r\nshe motioned them to advance. \"Help me to lay the emperor on yonder\r\nbed,\" said she. \"Take the feet and body, and I will bear his head.\"\r\n\r\nWith her strong arms, she raised him as a mother would move her sleeping\r\nchild, and, with the help of the valets, she laid her husband in his\r\ncoffin. This done, she again sent away the attendants, and then wrapped\r\nthe body in the shroud as though she had been protecting it from the\r\ncold.\r\n\r\n\"Come hither, Charlotte,\" said she, \"with your scissors.\" Charlotte\r\napproached noiselessly. \"Cut off my hair,\" continued she, taking out her\r\ncomb, and letting down the rich masses until it fell about her person\r\nlike another shroud.\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty, no,\" cried Charlotte, bursting into tears. \"I never\r\ncan cut off that magnificent hair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good child,\" said the empress, \"many a weary hour has that magnificent\r\nhair cost you, and do you ask to have it spared? It shall give you no\r\nmore trouble. Take the scissors and cut it off!\"\r\n\r\n\"Has your majesty then forgotten,\" pleaded Charlotte, \"how dearly the\r\nemperor loved this hair?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Charlotte, and therefore he must have it. 'Tis the last love-token\r\nI have to give him. I cannot die with him like an Indian wife; but\r\nreligion does not forbid me to lay this offering at least in his coffin.\r\nHe used so often to pass his hands through it--he was so proud of its\r\nbeauty, that now he is gone, no one else shall see it. Say no more,\r\nCharlotte, but cut it off.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress bent her head, while Charlotte, with a heart-felt sigh and\r\ntrembling hands, cut off the long and beautiful blond hair which Maria\r\nTheresa laid as a love-token in the coffin of her husband. [Footnote:\r\nCaroline Pichler. \"Memoirs,\" vol. i., p.23.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nTHE IMPERIAL ABBESS.\r\n\r\nThe funeral rites were over. In the crypt of the church of the\r\nCapuchins, under the monument which, twenty years before, the empress\r\nhad built for herself and her husband, lay the body of Emperor Francis.\r\nIn this vault slept all the imperial dead of the house of Hapsburg. One\r\nafter another, with closed eyes and folded hands their marble effigies\r\nwere stretched across their tombs, stiff and cold as the bones that were\r\nburied beneath. The eternal night of death reigned over those couchant\r\nimages of stone and bronze.\r\n\r\nBut Maria Theresa and her emperor had conquered death. Both rising from\r\nthe tomb, their eyes were fixed upon each other with an expression of\r\ndeepest tenderness; while Azrael, who stood behind with a wreath of\r\ncypress in his hands, seemed to have transformed himself into an angel\r\nof love that sanctified their union even beyond the tomb.\r\n\r\nAll had left the vault save the widowed empress; she had remained behind\r\nto weep and pray. Her prayers ended, she drew her long black cloak\r\naround her and strode through the church, unmindful of the monks, who,\r\non either side of the aisle, awaited her appearance in respectful\r\nsilence. She heeded neither their inclined heads nor their looks of\r\nsympathy; stunned by grief, she was unmindful of externals, and scarcely\r\nknew that she had left the vault, when her coach stopped before the\r\nimperial palace.\r\n\r\nOnce there Maria Theresa passed by the splendid apartments which she had\r\ninhabited during her husband's life, and ascending the staircase to the\r\nsecond story of the palace, she entered upon the dwelling which had been\r\nprepared for her widowhood. It was simple to coldness. Hung with black,\r\nnothing relieved the gloom of these rooms; neither mirror, picture,\r\ngilding, nor flowers were there. The bedroom looked sad in the extreme.\r\nThe walls were hung in gray silk; gray velvet curtains were drawn in\r\nfront of the small widow's bed; the floor was covered with a gray carpet\r\nstudded with white lilies, and the furniture was like the curtains, of\r\ndim, dull gray velvet. [Footnote: Caroline Pichler, \"Memoirs,\" vol. i.,\r\np. 20.]\r\n\r\nAs the empress entered this dismal room she saluted her ladies of honor\r\nwho had followed her, and now stood awaiting her commands at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Bring all my dresses, shawls, laces, and jewels to me in the\r\nreception-room, and send a messenger to Prince Kaunitz to say that I\r\nawait his presence.\"\r\n\r\nThe ladies of honor left the room silently, and the empress, closing the\r\ndoor, began again to weep and pray. Meanwhile her attendants were\r\noccupied bringing up the costly wardrobe of their imperial mistress. In\r\na little while the dark rooms were brightened with velvet and silk of\r\nevery color, with gold and silver, with jewels and flowers.\r\n\r\nThe ladies looked with eager and admiring eyes at the magnificence which\r\nhad transformed this funereal apartment into a bazaar of elegance and\r\nluxury, scarcely daring to speak the hopes and wishes that were filling\r\nall their hearts. Suddenly their curious eyes sought the ground, for the\r\nempress appeared and entered the room. What a contrast between this pale\r\nfigure, clad in simplest mourning, and the rich costumes which in the\r\ndays of her happiness had heightened her beauty; those days which seemed\r\nto lie so far, far away from the bitter present\r\n\r\nThe empress laid her hand upon her heart, as if to stifle a cry of\r\nanguish; then approaching the black marble table, she took up some of\r\nthe dresses that lay upon it.\r\n\r\nWith a voice softer and more pathetic than ever they had heard before,\r\nshe begged the companions of her happier days to accept and wear these\r\ncostly things as a legacy from the emperor. She then divied them as se\r\nthought best; assigning to each lady what best became her and was most\r\nappropriate.\r\n\r\nHer ladies stood weeping around, while Maria Theresa besought each one\r\nto pardon the trouble she had given in her joyous days, for the sake of\r\nthe misery she now endured. And as she entreated them to forget that she\r\nhad been imperious and exacting, they knelt weeping at her feet, and\r\nearnestly implored her not to leave them.\r\n\r\nThe empress sadly shook her head. \"I am no longer an empress,\" said she,\r\n\"I am a poor, humbled woman, who needs no more attendance, whose only\r\naim on earth is to serve God and die in His favor! Pray for the emperor,\r\nchar friends, and pray for me also.\"\r\n\r\nSlowly turning away, she left the room and entered her cabinet, which\r\nopened into the gray bedroom.\r\n\r\n\"And now to my last worldly task,\" said she, as ringing a silver\r\nhand-bell she bade a page conduct Prince Kaunitz to her presence.\r\n\r\nThe page opened the door, and the prince came in.\r\n\r\nThe empress greeted him with a silent bend of her head, and exhausted,\r\nsank into an arm-chair that stood before her writing-desk. Kaunitz,\r\nwithout awaiting permission, took a seat opposite.\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause. At length Kaunitz said: \"Your majesty has\r\nhonored me by commanding my presence hither.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I sent for you because I have something of great importance to\r\nsay,\" replied the empress.\r\n\r\n\"I am all attention,\" replied the minister. \"For it is worthy of your\r\nnoble self so soon to stifle your grief and to attend to the duties of\r\nyour crown. You have sent for me that we may work. And your majesty has\r\ndone well, for much business has accumulated on our hands since we last\r\nheld a cabinet council.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress shook her head. \"Business no longer troubles me,\" replied\r\nshe; \"I have sent for you to say that we are no longer to work\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does that mean that your majesty is about to dismiss me in disgrace?\r\nAre you no longer satisfied with your minister?\" asked Kaunitz.\r\n\r\n\"No, prince. It means that I myself must retire from the bustle and\r\nvanities of this world. My hands are no longer fit to wield a sceptre;\r\nthey must be folded in prayer--in prayer for my emperor, who was called\r\naway without receiving the sacraments of the church. My strength is gone\r\nfrom me; my crown oppresses me; I can no longer be an empress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you made a sovereign by any power of yours?\" asked Kaunitz. \"Had\r\nyou the choice of becoming an empress or remaining an archduchess? What\r\ndid your majesty say to me when the insolent Charles of Bavaria tried to\r\nwrest your imperial crown from your head?--'I received my crown from the\r\nhands of God, and I must defend my divine right!' Floods of noble blood\r\nwere spilled that Maria Theresa might preserve her right; and does she\r\nnow intend to dim the glory of her crown by sacrificing it to her sorrow\r\nas a wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am tired of life and of the world, and I intend to take refuge from\r\ntheir troubles in a cloister. Say no more! I am resolved to go, and the\r\npalace at Innspruck shall be my convent. There, on the spot where he\r\ndied, will I make my vows; and as an abbess will I spend my life praying\r\nthat God may give him eternal rest. My vocation as a sovereign is at an\r\nend; I resign my sceptre to my son.\" [Footnote: Coxe, \"History of the\r\nHouse of Austria,\" vol. v., page 188.]\r\n\r\n\"That means that your majesty will destroy with your own hands the\r\nstructure you had commenced; that you have grown faint-hearted, and are\r\nunfaithful to your duty and to your subjects.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will follow the steps of my great ancestor, Charles V.,\" cried the\r\nempress with energy. \"I lay down my earthly dignity to humble myself\r\nbefore God.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your majesty will be quite as unhappy as your ancestor. Do you\r\nsuppose that the poor monk ever was able to forget that he had been a\r\ngreat prince?\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet Charles V. remained for several years in a cloister.\" \"But what\r\na life, your majesty! A life of regret, repentance, and despair. Believe\r\nme, it is far better like Caesar to die pierced by twenty daggers on the\r\nsteps of a throne, than voluntarily to descend from that throne to enter\r\nthe miserable walls of a cloister.\"\r\n\r\n\"Better perhaps for those who have not renounced the world and its\r\npomps,\" cried the empress, raising her beautiful eyes to heaven. \"But it\r\nis neither satiety nor weariness of grandeur that has drive me to a\r\ncloister. It is my love for my emperor, my yearning to be alone with God\r\nand the past.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, your majesty,\" said Kaunitz with emphasis, \"you will not be alone\r\nwith the past; the maledictions of your people will follow you Will they\r\nhold you guiltless to have broken your faith with them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not have broken my faith; I shall have left to my people a\r\nsuccessor to whom sooner or later they will owe the same allegiance as\r\nthey now owe me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But a successor who will overturn all that his mother has done for\r\nAustria's welfare. Your majesty laid the foundations of Austria's\r\ngreatness. To that end you called me to the lofty station which I now\r\noccupy. Remember that together we pledged our lives and love to Austria.\r\nBe not untrue to the covenant. In the name of that people which I then\r\nrepresented, I claim from their emperor, Maria Theresa, the strict\r\nfulfilment of her bond. I call upon her to be true to her duty as the\r\nruler of a great nation, until the hand of God releases her from her\r\ncrown and her life.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Kaunitz spoke, Maria Theresa walked up and down the room with\r\ntroubled brow and folded arms. As lie ceased, she came and stood before\r\nhim, looking earnestly into his face, which now had cast aside its mask\r\nof tranquillity, and showed visible signs of agitation.\r\n\r\n\"You are a bold advocate of my people's claims,\" said she; \"a brave\r\ndefender of my Austria. I rejoice to know it, and never will take\r\numbrage at what you have so nobly spoken. But you have not convinced me;\r\nmy sorrow speaks louder than your arguments. You have termed me 'your\r\nemperor.' I know why you have once more called me by that flattering\r\ntitle. You wish to remind me that in mounting the throne of my ancestors\r\nI lost the right to grieve as a woman, and pledged myself to gird on the\r\narmor of manhood. Hitherto I have made it my pride to plan, to reign, to\r\nfight like a man. I have always feared that men might say of me that my\r\nhand was too weak to grasp the reins of power. But God, who perhaps gave\r\nme the head of a man while leaving me the heart of a woman, has punished\r\nme for my ambition. He has left me to learn that, alas! I am but a\r\nwoman--with all the weakness of my sex. It is that womanly heart which,\r\nthrobbing with an anguish that no words can paint, has vanquished my\r\nhead; and loud above all thoughts of my duty as an empress is the wail\r\nof my sorrow as a widow! But I will show you, Kaunitz, that I am not\r\nstubborn. I shall communicate my intentions to no one. For four weeks I\r\nwill retire to my cloister. Instead of naming Joseph my successor, I\r\nwill appoint him co-regent. If, after four weeks of probation, I still\r\nfeel that I can without guilt retire from the world, shall I then be\r\nabsolved from my oath, and suffered to lay down my crown without\r\nreproach from my faithful minister?\"\r\n\r\n\"If, after four weeks of unlimited power delegated to the Emperor\r\nJoseph, your majesty still thinks that you have a right to abdicate,\"\r\nreplied Kaunitz, \"I shall make no opposition to your majesty's choice of\r\na private vocation, for I shall feel that after that time remonstrance\r\nwith you would be useless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, my novitiate shall begin to-morrow. Apprise the court and\r\nthe foreign representatives that I wish to meet them in the throne-room,\r\nwhere in their presence I will appoint my son emperor co-regent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CO-REGENT.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa had kept her word. She had appointed her son co-regent,\r\ninvesting the young emperor with full power to reign, to make laws, to\r\npunish, to reward, and to govern her people, while she retired to the\r\npalace of Innspruck. There she dwelt in strictest privacy, scarcely\r\nseeing her children, and restricting her intercourse to the first lady\r\nof honor, her confessor, and a few chosen friends, whom she sometimes\r\nadmitted to her mournful rooms.\r\n\r\nJoseph, the young emperor of four-and-twenty years, was now monarch of\r\nall Austria, Hungary, Lombardy, and the Netherlands. He had reached the\r\ngoal of his longings for power, and now he could begin to think about\r\nthe happiness of his people.\r\n\r\nSince the intoxicating moment when Maria Theresa, in the presence of the\r\nwhole court, had named him co-regent, and delivered over to his hands\r\nher vast empire, Joseph felt as if he had suddenly been transported to a\r\nworld of enchantment. He had, together with her ministers, dissuaded the\r\nempress from her resolution of retiring to Innspruck; but even as he\r\njoined his voice to theirs, his heart was trembling with fear lest she\r\nshould yield. He felt that if she revoked the power she had conferred,\r\nhe would almost die with disappointment. But the empress remained firm,\r\nand her son was triumphant.\r\n\r\nShe had gone from the throne to the solitude of her own apartments, and\r\nleft him lord and emperor of Austria! He would no longer be obliged to\r\nconceal his thoughts; they should come out into the broad day as deeds,\r\nfor he was sovereign there!\r\n\r\nA day and night had passed by since his mother had renounced her rights\r\nto him. He could not sleep. His head was full of plans, his heart of\r\nemotion. He dared not sleep--he who was the guardian of millions of his\r\nfellow-beings--he who felt ready to shed his heart's blood for their\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nOn the first day, Joseph had been in council with the ministers of\r\nstate. The will of the deceased emperor had been opened, and his son now\r\nlearned, that while his mother was conferring upon him power, his father\r\nhad left him boundless wealth. The Emperor Francis had left his eldest\r\nson sole heir to his estates in Hungary and Galicia, to his jewels and\r\ntreasures, and also to the millions of money which he had accumulated\r\nthrough manufactures and trade.\r\n\r\nHe had also left to his eldest son the twenty-two millions of coupons\r\nwhich he had taken for the gold which he had advanced to the state for\r\nthe prosecution of the Seven Years' War. Joseph was therefore the\r\nrichest prince in all Germany, for his father's vast estates amounted to\r\none hundred and fifty-nine millions of guilders. [Footnote: Hubner,\r\n\"Life of Joseph II.\" vol. i., page 28.] But he who had been so\r\nintoxicated with joy at his mother's gift, seemed scarcely moved at all\r\nas he received the tidings of his vast inheritance.\r\n\r\n\"I wish that my father had bought all the coupons that were issued, and\r\nthat they were all mine,\" said he, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty would be no gainer thereby,\" replied the lord keeper of\r\nthe finances, Von Kinsky. \"These coupons bear but little interest, and\r\npaper money is not gold. Its value is nominal.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it has one merit,\" replied the emperor, smiling; \"it can be burned.\r\nOh, what a miserable invention is this paper money, which represents\r\nvalue, but possesses none! Suppose that all the holders of these coupons\r\nwere to come in this morning and ask for their redemption, could the\r\nimperial coffers meet their obligations?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if they all came at once, your majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the people have a right to call for them,\" said the emperor. \"In\r\nlending their money, they showed their confidence in the government, and\r\nthis confidence must not be betrayed. Let the twenty-two millions of\r\ncoupons be put in a package and brought to my private apartments. I wish\r\nto dispose of them.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout this day Joseph was so absorbed by business, both private and\r\nofficial, that he had no opportunity of exhibiting himself in his new\r\ncharacter, either to his family or his subjects.\r\n\r\nBut, on the second day of his co-regency, the young emperor appeared in\r\npublic. On this day, the Viennese celebrated the deliverance of Vienna\r\nfrom the Turks by John Sobieski and his brave Polish legions. The\r\nmourning of the female members of the imperial family did not permit\r\nthem to mingle as usual with the people on this favorite festival; but\r\nthe emperor resolved to show himself on this occasion in the character\r\nof a sovereign. All Vienna was eager to see him as soon as it became\r\nrumored that he would certainly attend the mass in honor of the day at\r\nthe cathedral of St. Stephen.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the young emperor was in his palace. The anterooms were\r\nfilled with petitioners of every sort, who, through bribes offered to\r\nthe members of the imperial household, had penetrated thus far, and were\r\nnow awaiting the appearance of the emperor. The anterooms of Maria\r\nTheresa had always been thronged with these petitioners, and now they\r\njostled each other without ceremony, each one hoping to be remarked by\r\nthe emperor as he passed on to his carriage.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the commotion ceased and took the form of a panic as the door\r\nopened and the valets of the emperor came forward, their hands filled\r\nwith the petitions which they had just taken in. They had all been\r\nrefused!\r\n\r\nA few moments afterward the door opened again, and the lord chamberlain,\r\nCount Rosenberg, advanced to the centre of the room.\r\n\r\nThere was no necessity for the pages to order silence, for the crowd\r\nwere breathless with expectation, and the deepest stillness reigned\r\nthroughout the thronged rooms while Count Rosenberg read the first\r\ngreeting of the emperor to his people.\r\n\r\nIt was sharp, and to the point. It forbade, in strongest terms, all\r\nindirect efforts to obtain promotion or pensions; and it declared once\r\nfor all that merit alone would be the test of all applications presented\r\nto the Emperor Joseph II.\r\n\r\nWhen the count had done reading the proclamation, the valets laid the\r\npetitions upon a table, that each man might select and remove his own\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty has made some enemies to-day,\" said Count Rosenberg, as he\r\nreentered the cabinet of the emperor. \"I saw many a scowl in the\r\nanteroom as I passed by the disappointed multitude that thronged my\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish the friendship of intriguers and flatterers,\" replied the\r\nemperor with a merry laugh. \"If my proclamations make me enemies, I\r\nthink they will also make me friends. The good shall be satisfied with\r\nmy rule; for, during my mother's reign, I have observed much and thought\r\nmuch. And now the day has come when the power is mine to reward virtue\r\nand punish vice.\"\r\n\r\n\"May Heaven grant that your majesty's day draw to a close without clouds\r\nor storms!\" said Rosenberg.\r\n\r\nThe emperor laughed again. \"What do you fear, my friend?\" asked he.\r\n\"Have you so long shared with me my burden of dissimulation, that you\r\nare frightened to see our shackles fall? Are you afraid of the fresh\r\nair, because we wear our masks no longer? Patience, Rosenberg, and al\r\nwill be well with us. Our dreams are about to be fulfilled: what we have\r\nwhispered together in the twilight of mutual trust, we may now cry out\r\nwith free and joyous shouts--'Reform! reform!' My people have prayed\r\nquite enough, they shall now learn to do something better--they shall\r\nthink; they have been long enough led by faith, like little children. I\r\nwill give them confirmation, and they shall enter upon the\r\nresponsibilities of manhood. I mean to be a blessing to the virtuous,\r\nand a terror to the vicious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unhappily, there is more evil than good in this world,\" said Count\r\nRosenberg, sighing, \"and a man, though he can seldom count his friends,\r\nis never at a loss to count his enemies.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand you,\" said Joseph, smiling. \"I intend to draw out\r\nthe fangs of the wicked, so that they shall have power to injure no\r\none.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty will do this if time be granted you,\" said the count.\r\n\"If--\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" cried the emperor, impatiently, as Rosenberg\r\nhesitated. \"Speak on. What do you fear?\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear,\" whispered the count, \"that your day will be darkened by bigots\r\nand priests. I fear that the empress will not leave you freedom to carry\r\nout your reformation. I fear that your enemies will dry up her tears,\r\nand unclasp her folded hands, to force within their grasp the sceptre to\r\nwhich your manhood gives you exclusive right. I fear the influence of\r\nher confessor, Father Porhammer: try to conciliate him. It is far better\r\nto win over our opponents by forbearance, than to exasperate them by\r\nopen warfare.\"\r\n\r\n\"But open warfare is my right,\" cried Joseph, \"and I am powerful enough\r\nto despise all opponents, as well as strong enough to pursue my way\r\nwithout regard to the wickedness of all the bigots in Christendom. Face\r\nto face shall we stand, and I defy them all! We have had enough, too, of\r\nSpanish etiquette and Italian mummery here. Now we shall have honest\r\nGerman customs; we shall be Germans in thought, in speech, and in\r\nsentiment. This is my dream, my bright and beautiful dream! Austria\r\nshall one day be Germanized; the kingdoms and provinces which compose my\r\ndominions shall no longer be separate nationalities, but all shall be\r\nthe branches of one lofty tree. The limbs shall lose their names, and be\r\ncalled by that of the trunk; and the trunk shall bear the name of\r\nGermany. High above the boughs of this noble tree, which shall extend\r\nfrom France to Poland, I will place my banner and my crown, and before\r\ntheir might all Europe shall bow. This is my dream, Rosenberg, my dream\r\nof future greatness!\"\r\n\r\n\"While I listen and look upon your majesty's countenance, bright with\r\ninspiration, I, too, bow before the grandeur of your thought, and feel\r\nas if this godlike dream must surely become a glorious truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"It shall be glorious truth, Rosenberg,\" exclaimed the emperor. \"Why\r\nshould Germany be severed into many parts, when France and Spain are\r\neach a kingdom in itself? Why is England so powerful? Because Scotland\r\nand Ireland have lost their identity in hers. Sweden and Norway, are\r\nthey not, or rather ought they not to be, one? And Russia, how many\r\ndifferent races own the sway of the mighty Czar? My empire, too, shall\r\nbecome strong through unity, and I shall be not only emperor of Austria,\r\nbut, in very deed and truth, emperor of all Germany!\"\r\n\r\nRosenberg shook his head, and sighed. \"Ah, your majesty,\" said he, \"you\r\nare so young that you believe in the realization of mortal dreams.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do, and I intend to workout their realization myself. I shall begin\r\nby being German myself. I intend to do away with ceremony, priestcraft,\r\nand foreign influence. To that intent, my lord chamberlain, you will see\r\nthat all foreigners are dismissed from the palace, and their places\r\nsupplied by Germans. My two Italian valets I make over to Porhammer.\r\nNothing but German shall be spoken at court. I will have neither French\r\nnor Italian actors here. Count Durazzo shall dismiss his foreign troupes\r\nand employ Germans in their stead. [Footnote: Gross-Hoffinger, \"History\r\nof Joseph II.,\" vol. i., p. 91.] Let him see that the German stage\r\nflourishes and does honor to the metropolis of the German empire.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is an ordinance that will enchant the youths of Vienna,\" replied\r\nthe count, gayly.\r\n\r\n\"Here is another which will equally rejoice their hearts as well as\r\nthose of all the pretty women in Vienna,\" added the emperor.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty means to revoke the power of the committee on morals?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not quite. I dare not fly so soon in the face of my lady-mother's pet\r\ninstitutions,\" returned Joseph, laughing; \"but I shall suspend them\r\nuntil further notice. Now the pretty sinners may all go to sleep in\r\npeace. Now the young girls of Vienna may walk the streets without being\r\nasked whither they go, or whence they come. Reform! reform! But hark!\r\nthere are the church-bells; I go to exhibit myself to my subjects. Come,\r\nlet us away.\"\r\n\r\n\"But your majesty has not made your toilet. The valets are now waiting\r\nwith your Spanish court-dress in your dressing-room.\"\r\n\r\n\"I make them a present of it,\" said the emperor. \"The day of Spanish\r\ncourt-dresses is over. The uniform of my regiment shall be my\r\ncourt-dress hereafter, so that you see I am dressed and ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then allow me to order that the carriage of state be prepared for your\r\nmajesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Order that the carriage of state be left to rot in the empress's\r\nstables,\" returned Joseph. \"The day of etiquette, also, is over. I am a\r\nman like other men, and have as much use of my limbs as they. Let\r\ncripples and dotards ride--I shall go to church on foot.\"\r\n\r\n\"But your majesty,\" remonstrated Rosenberg, \"what will the people say\r\nwhen they see their emperor stripped of all the pomp of his high\r\nstation? They will think that you hold them too cheaply to visit them in\r\nstate.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no. My people will feel that I come among them, not with the cold\r\nsplendor of my rank, but with the warmth of human sympathy and human\r\nnature, and they will greet me with more enthusiasm than if I came in my\r\ncarriage of state.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor was right. The people who had thronged every street through\r\nwhich he was to pass, shouted for joy, when they saw the ruler of all\r\nAustria on foot, accompanied by a few of his friends, making his way\r\namong them with as much simplicity as a burgher.\r\n\r\nAt first astonishment had repressed the enthusiasm of the Viennese, but\r\nthis momentary reticence overcome, the subjects of Joseph the Second\r\nrent the air with their cries of welcome, and pressed around his path,\r\nall eager to look into the face of the sovereign who walked among his\r\npeople as an equal and a man.\r\n\r\n\"See him! see him!\" cried they. \"See the German prince who is not\r\nashamed to be a German! See our emperor in the uniform of the German\r\ninfantry! Long live the emperor! Long live our fatherland! Long live the\r\nemperor!\" shouted the multitude while Joseph, his heart overflowing with\r\njoy, made his way at last to the cathedral of St. Stephen.\r\n\r\nAnd now the trumpets sounded, and the mighty organ thundered forth a\r\nwelcome, while cardinals and priests lifted their voices, and the clergy\r\nsang the \"Salvum fac imperatorum nostrum.\"\r\n\r\nAnd ever and anon, through the open windows of the cathedral, the people\r\nshouted, \"Long live the emperor! Long live our fatherland!\"\r\n\r\nOvercome by the ovation, Joseph sank down upon his knees, and his heart\r\nsoftened by the scene, the circumstances, and the sublime chants of the\r\nchurch, he prayed. Clasping his hands, he prayed that God might give him\r\nstrength to do his duty to his subjects, and to make them happy.\r\n\r\nThe \"Salvum fac imperatorum\" over, the mass for the repose of the soul\r\nof Sobieski and his twelve thousand Poles was intoned. The emperor\r\nprayed for them, and thanked the Almighty Ruler of all things for the\r\nrescue they had brought to Vienna in her hour of danger from the\r\ninfidel.\r\n\r\nThis was the first public act of Joseph's reign as co-regent.\r\n\r\nThe mass over, the people witnessed another public act of the young\r\nemperor's reign. While Joseph, smiling and bending his head to the\r\ncrowds that pressed around him, was quietly pursuing his way back to the\r\npalace, a procession was seen coming through the streets which attracted\r\nthe attention of the multitude, and called forth their wonder.\r\n\r\nFirst came a file of soldiers, with shouldered carbines, then an open\r\nvehicle drawn by horses from the imperial stables, then another file of\r\nsoldiers. Within the wagons sat several officers of the emperor's\r\nhousehold, with large rolls of paper in their hands, and behind it was a\r\ndetachment of cavalry with drawn sabres.\r\n\r\n\"What means this pageant?\" asked the people of one another.\r\n\r\nFor all answer to this question, the multitudes pressed forward and fell\r\nin with the mysterious procession.\r\n\r\nThe train moved on, until it arrived at an open market-place, where it\r\nhalted. In the centre of the square was a heap of fagots, near which\r\nstood two men with lighted torches in their hands.\r\n\r\n\"An execution!\" cried the terror-stricken multitude. \"But what an\r\nexecution! Who was to be burnt at the stake?\"\r\n\r\nWhile the crowd were murmuring within themselves, the officers of the\r\nemperor's household advanced to the pile, and laid the rolls of papers\r\nwhich they had brought, upon it. They then signed to the people for\r\nsilence, and one of the officers addressed the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"The Emperor Joseph, co-regent with the Empress Maria Theresa, sends\r\ngreeting to his subjects,\" cried he in a clear, loud voice. \"To-day, the\r\nfirst of his reign, and the festival of John Sobieski the deliverer of\r\nVienna, he wishes to prove to his people how much he loves them. In\r\ntestimony whereof, he presents to them twenty-two millions of coupons,\r\nbequeathed to him by his father the late Emperor Francis. These papers\r\nare the coupons. In the name of the Emperor Joseph approach, ye\r\ntorch-bearers, and kindle the pile, that the people of Austria, made\r\nricher by twenty-two millions, may recognize, in this sacrifice, the\r\nlove of their sovereign.\"\r\n\r\nThe torches were applied, and high in the air soared the flames that\r\nwere consuming the emperor's bequest, while the faces of the multitude\r\naround were lit up by the glare of the burning pile.\r\n\r\nThe bells of the churches began to chime, the flames soared higher and\r\nhigher, and the people looked on in wondering gratitude at the\r\ntwenty-two millions of consuming guilders, which were the first offering\r\nof Joseph II to his subjects. [Hormayer. \"Austrian Plutarch.\" vol. i. p\r\n129]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nHAROUN AL RASCHID.\r\n\r\nThe emperor was alone in his dressing-cabinet. He stood before a mirror,\r\ncovering his rich blond curls with a large wig, which fell in long\r\nringlets over his shoulders, and completed the very singular costume in\r\nwhich it had pleased is majesty to array himself.\r\n\r\nThe emperor surveyed himself with evident satisfaction, and broke out\r\ninto a hearty laugh. \"I think,\" said he, \"that in this dark-haired fop,\r\nwith his fashionable costume, no one will recognize the emperor. I\r\nsuppose that in this disguise I may go undetected in search of\r\nadventures. If I am to be of use as a prince, I must see all things,\r\nprove all things, and learn all things. It is written, 'Prove all\r\nthings, and hold fast to that which is good.' I am afraid that I shall\r\nnot hold fast to much that comes under my observation.\"\r\n\r\nHe drew back from the mirror, threw over his shoulders a little cloak,\r\nbordered with fur, set a three-cornered hat upon the top of his wig,\r\ntook up a small gold-headed cane, and then returned to survey himself a\r\nsecond time.\r\n\r\n\"A fop of the latest style--that is to say, a fool of the first water\r\n--looks out upon himself from this looking-glass,\" said he, laughing.\r\n\"It would be an affront to my majesty if any one were to presume to\r\nsuspect the emperor under this absurd disguise. I hope I shall be as\r\nsuccessful in the way of adventures as was my predecessor Haroun al\r\nRaschid.\"\r\n\r\nHe drew his cloak close around him, and stepped from a little private\r\ndoor that opened from his dressing-room into the corridor which led to\r\nthe apartments of his wife. Retired and unobserved, the Empress Josepha\r\nlived within these rooms, which from the first night of their marriage,\r\nher husband had never reentered. The corridor was empty. Joseph could\r\ntherefore pass out unobserved, until he reached a private staircase\r\nleading to the lower floor of the palace. Once there, he raised his\r\nhead, and stepped boldly out into the hall. The porters allowed him to\r\npass without suspicion, and, unrecognized, the young adventurer reached\r\nthe public thoroughfares.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" thought he, with a sensation of childish delight, \"now I am free,\r\na man just like other men. I defy any one to see my divine right upon my\r\nbrow, or to observe any difference between the 'imperial blue' of my\r\neyes, and the ordinary blue of those of my subjects.\"\r\n\r\n\"Halt, there!\" cried a threatening voice to the careless pedestrian.\r\n\"Out of the way, young coxcomb; do you suppose that I must give way to\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, your worship,\" replied Joseph, smiling, as with an active\r\nbound he cleared the way for a colossal carman, who, covered with sweat\r\nand dust, was wheeling a load of bricks in a barrow.\r\n\r\nThe carman stopped, and surveying the emperor angrily, cried out in a\r\nvoice of thunder, \"What do you mean by calling me 'your worship?' Do you\r\nmean to insult me because you are wasting your father's money on your\r\npretty person, decked out like a flower-girl on a holiday?\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven forbid that I should seek to insult you!\" replied the emperor.\r\n\"The size of your fists is enough to inspire any one with respect. For\r\nall the world I would not offend their owner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, go your way, you whippersnapper,\" muttered the carman,\r\nwhile the emperor congratulated himself upon having gotten out of the\r\nscrape without detection.\r\n\r\n\"It would have been a pretty anecdote for the history of the Emperor\r\nJoseph, had he been discovered in a street brawl with a carman,\" said he\r\nto himself. \"A little more, and my imperial face would have been pounded\r\ninto jelly by that Hercules of a fellow! It is not such an easy matter\r\nas I had supposed, to mix on equal terms with other men! But I shall\r\nlearn by bitter experience how to behave.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment Joseph heard the sounds of weeping. Turning, he beheld\r\ncoming toward him a young girl of about sixteen, whose slight figure, in\r\nspite of the cool autumn day, was scarcely covered by a thin, patched\r\ndress of dark stuff. An old, faded silk handkerchief was thrown over her\r\nshoulders; her sweet, pale face was bedewed with tears, and her lips\r\nwere murmuring gentle complaints, though no one stopped to listen. On\r\nher right arm she carried a bundle, which every now and then she\r\nwatched, as if afraid that some one might rob her of its treasures.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a kind voice whispered, \"Why do you weep, my child?\"\r\n\r\nThe young girl started and met the gaze of a young man, whose blue eyes\r\nwere fixed upon her with an expression of tenderest sympathy.\r\n\r\n\"I weep,\" said she, \"because I am unhappy,\" and she quickened her steps\r\nthat she might leave him behind. But the emperor kept pace with her.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you walk so fast? are you afraid of me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear the committee of morals,\" said she, blushing. \"If they should\r\nsee me with you, I might be mistaken for--\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever been suspected by them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, although I have always tried, when I was in the streets, to\r\navoid observation. Go, sir, go. Do not heed my tears. I am accustomed to\r\nmisfortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is said that the emperor has suspended the office of that\r\ncommittee.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad of it,\" replied the girl, \"for good and evil are alike\r\nexposed to suspicion; and I would like to walk the streets without fear\r\nof being taken for what I am not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going, child?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going,\" replied she, with a fresh burst of tears, \"to sell the\r\nclothes I carry in this bundle.\"\r\n\r\n\"What clothes, child?\"\r\n\r\n\"The last decent covering that my poor mother owns,\" sobbed the girl.\r\n\r\n\"You are, then, very poor?\" asked the emperor, softly.\r\n\r\n\"Very poor. We are often hungry, and have no food but our own bitter\r\ntears. These are the last clothes we have, but they must go for bread,\r\nand then perhaps we shall perish of cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor girl! have you no father?\"\r\n\r\n\"My father died in defence of Austria and the empress, and as a reward\r\nof his devotion to his sovereign, his wife and child have been left to\r\ndie of want.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your father was a soldier?\" asked the emperor, much affected.\r\n\r\n\"He was an officer, who served with distinction in the Seven Years' War.\r\nBut he never was promoted. He died for Maria Theresa, and his widow and\r\nchild will soon follow him to the grave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why have you never applied to the empress for relief? Her purse is\r\nalways open to the wants of the needy.\"\r\n\r\n\"To obtain any thing from royalty, sir, you know that one must have\r\ninfluence,\" replied the girl, bitterly. \"We have no influence, nor would\r\nwe know how to intrigue for favor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then, do you not go to the emperor? He at least has no fancy for\r\nintriguers and flatterers. You should have gone to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be haughtily repulsed?\" said she. \"Oh, sir, the new emperor is a man\r\nwhose only love is a love of power, and whose only pleasure is to make\r\nthat power felt by others. Has he not already refused to listen to any\r\npetition whatever? Did he not forbid his people to come to him for\r\nfavors?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did that,\" replied Joseph, \"because he wished to do justice to all;\r\nand for that reason he has done away with all presentation of petitions\r\nthrough courtiers or other officers of his household. But he has\r\nappointed an hour to receive all those who present their petitions in\r\nperson.\"\r\n\r\n\"So he has said,\" returned the girl, \"but no one believes him. His\r\nguards will turn away all who are not richly dressed, and so the emperor\r\nwill have promised to see the people, though the people will never be\r\nallowed to come into his presence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have the Austrians so little faith in the sincerity of the emperor?\"\r\nasked Joseph. \"Do they think that his heart--\"\r\n\r\n\"His heart!\" exclaimed the girl. \"The emperor is without a heart. Even\r\ntoward his mother he is said to be undutiful and obstinate. He hates his\r\nwife, and she is as mild as an angel. He whose pleasure it is to see an\r\nempress at his feet, do you suppose that he can sympathize with the\r\nmisfortunes of his subjects? No, no; he has already stopped all pensions\r\nwhich the generous empress had given from her private purse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he intends to bestow them upon worthier objects.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; it is because he is a miser.\"\r\n\r\n\"He a miser!\" cried Joseph. \"Did he not some days ago burn up twenty-two\r\nmillions of coupons?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was said so; but no one saw them; and it is whispered that the\r\ntwenty-two millions were nothing but pieces of waste paper.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor was speechless. He looked at this young traducer with an\r\nexpression of real horror.\r\n\r\n\"How!\" at length said he, in a voice choked by emotion, \"the emperor is\r\nsuspected of such baseness!\"\r\n\r\n\"He is known to be selfish and miserly,\" replied his tormentor.\r\n\r\nJoseph's eyes flashed with anger; but conquering his bitterness, he\r\nconstrained himself to smile.\r\n\r\n\"My child,\" said he, \"you have been deceived. If you knew the emperor,\r\nyou would find that he is generous and ready to do justice to all men.\r\nGo home and write your petition; and come to-day at noon to the imperial\r\npalace. The guards will allow you to pass, and a servant will be there\r\nto conduct you to me. I, myself, will present your petition, and I know\r\nthat the emperor will not refuse a pension to the widow and child of a\r\nbrave Austrian officer.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl's eyes filled with tears as she attempted to thank her unknown\r\nbenefactor.\r\n\r\nBut the emperor, who had allowed her to abuse him without interruption,\r\nwould not listen to her praises.\r\n\r\n\"Your mother is sick, and needs care,\" said he. \"Go home, and do not\r\nsell your clothes, for you will need them to visit the emperor. How much\r\ndid you expect to get for them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I expected seven ducats, for a portion of this clothing is my mother's\r\nwedding-dress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, my child, let me beg you to accept twelve,\" said he, drawing out\r\nhis purse. \"I hope they will suffice for your wants until the emperor\r\nfills them all.\"\r\n\r\nThe young girl bent over and kissed Joseph's hand. \"Oh, sir,\" said she,\r\n\"you save us from death, and we have nothing to offer in return but our\r\npoor prayers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray for the emperor,\" said he, gently. \"Pray God that he may win the\r\nlove of his people. Farewell! I shall wait for you today, at noon.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, Joseph quickened his pace, and was soon lost to view.\r\n\r\n\"My second adventure,\" thought he. \"I must confess that it is not very\r\nflattering to walk incognito about the streets and hear the sentiments\r\nof one's own subjects. How often do kings mistake the murmurings of\r\ndiscontent for the outpourings of joy! It is so pleasant to believe in\r\nthe love of our subjects, and to shut our eyes to all doubts of their\r\nloyalty! But I am resolved to see and judge of the people for myself. My\r\npath will often be beset with thorns, but Fate has not made me a monarch\r\nfor my own good; I am an emperor for the good of others. That child has\r\nrevealed some painful truths to me; it would seem as if I were fated\r\nforever to be misjudged.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nTHE DISGUISE REMOVED.\r\n\r\nAt mid-day the emperor reentered the palace gates. This time he came\r\nthrough the principal entrance, feeling quite secure in his disguise.\r\n\r\nHe proceeded at once to the hall of reception, wondering whether his\r\nyoung protegee would present herself as he had requested her to do.\r\n\r\nThe sentries allowed him to pass, supposing him to be one of those about\r\nto seek an audience with the emperor. Unsuspected he reached the hall.\r\n\r\nYes, there was his little accuser. She stood trembling and blushing in\r\none corner of the room, holding in her hand a paper. As she recognized\r\nher unknown protector, she hastened to meet him, and timidly gave him\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sir,\" said she, \"you have been true to your word. I was so afraid\r\nyou would forget me, that I was several times on the point of leaving\r\nthis grand place. I feel lonely and ashamed; for you see that no one is\r\nhere but myself. Nobody trusts the emperor. And I, who am here, will\r\nsurely be repulsed; he never will be as kind as you have been to a poor\r\nfriendless girl. My mother has no hope; and if she has sent me to the\r\npalace, it was that I might see you again, and once more pour forth my\r\ngratitude for your kindness. If you would add another to the generous\r\ngift you have already bestowed, tell me your name, that my mother and I\r\nmay beg God's blessing upon it, and then let me go, for I feel that my\r\nvisit here will be vain!\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear child,\" said Joseph, laughing, \"if all the emperor's opponents\r\nwere as headstrong as you, the poor man would have but little hope of\r\never gaining the good-will of his subjects. But I intend to prove to you\r\nthat you are unjust. Give me your petition. I myself will present it for\r\nyou. Wait awhile, until I send a messenger who will conduct you to the\r\nemperor. Follow him and fear nothing, for I shall be there, too, and\r\nthere I will tell you my name. Au revoir.\"\r\n\r\nThe young girl looked anxiously after him as he disappeared and once\r\nmore betook herself to the window. Gradually the room filled with a sad,\r\nhumble, and trembling crowd, such as often throngs the anterooms of\r\nprinces and nobles--a crowd which, with tearful eyes and sorrowing\r\nhearts, so often returns home without succor and without hope.\r\n\r\nBut the people who were assembled in this hall of reception seemed more\r\nsanguine than is usual with petitioners for imperial favor. They chatted\r\ntogether of their various expectations; they spoke of the emperor's\r\nbenevolence; and all seemed to hope that they would be heard with\r\npatience, and favorably answered. A door opened, and an officer entered.\r\nHe looked sharply around the room, and then went directly to the window,\r\nwhere the young girl, with a beating heart, was listening to the praises\r\nof that emperor whom in her soul she believed to be a tyrant.\r\n\r\n\"The emperor will he here presently,\" said the officer, in answer to a\r\nstorm of inquiries from every side. \"But I have been ordered first to\r\nconduct this young lady, the daughter of a deceased officer, to his\r\nmajesty's presence.\"\r\n\r\nShe followed him, silent and anxious. They went through suites of\r\nsplendid rooms, whose costly decorations struck the child of poverty\r\nwith new dismay. At last they stopped in a richly gilded saloon, covered\r\nwith a carpet of Gobelin, and hung with the same rich tapestry.\r\n\r\n\"Remain here,\" said the officer, \"while I announce you to his majesty.\"\r\n\r\nHe disappeared behind the velvet portiere, and the frightened girl\r\nremained with a crowd of richly-dressed nobles, whose embroidered\r\ncourt-dresses and diamond crosses, almost blinded her with their\r\nsplendor.\r\n\r\nOnce more the portiere was drawn aside, and the officer beckoned the\r\ngirl to advance. She did so with trembling limbs and throbbing heart.\r\nThe hangings fell, and she was in the dread presence of the emperor. He\r\nstood near a window with his back toward her--a tall, graceful man, in a\r\nwhite uniform.\r\n\r\nThe poor girl felt as if she would cease to breathe, for this was the\r\ndecisive moment of her young life. The emperor could either consign her\r\nto misery, or raise her to comfort, and wipe away the tears of her dear,\r\nsuffering mother.\r\n\r\nHe turned and looked at her with a benevolent smile. \"Come hither, my\r\nchild,\" said he. \"You would speak with the emperor. I am he.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl uttered a stifled cry, and falling on her knees, she hid her\r\ndeath-like face in her hands. For she had recognized her unknown\r\nprotector. Yes, this noble man, who had proffered help and promised\r\nprotection, this was the emperor, and to his face she had called him\r\nmiser and tyrant!\r\n\r\nShe never for one moment thought whether he would punish her insolence;\r\nshe had but one feeling, that of unspeakable anguish for having wounded\r\na noble and generous heart. This alone caused her shame and grief.\r\n\r\nThe emperor approached, and looked with tenderness at the kneeling\r\nmaiden, through whose fingers her tears were flowing in streams.\r\n\r\n\"I have read your petition, and have found that you spoke the truth.\r\nFrom this day your father's pay falls to your mother; and at her death\r\nit shall revert to you. I beg you both to forgive the tardiness of this\r\nact of justice; for neither the empress nor I had ever heard that your\r\nfather had any family. Once more forgive us for all that you have\r\nendured since his death. And now, my child, rise from your knees; for\r\nhuman beings should kneel before God alone. Dry your tears, and hasten\r\nto your mother. Tell her that the emperor is not as heartless as he has\r\nbeen pictured to her by his enemies.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" cried she, \"I cannot rise until my sovereign has forgiven my\r\npresumption and my calumnies.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are forgiven; for what could you know of me, you poor child, but\r\nwhat you had been told? But now you know me yourself; and for the future\r\nif you hear me traduced, you will defend me, will you not?\" [Footnote:\r\nHistorical.] He reached out his hand, which she kissed and bedewed with\r\nher tears.\r\n\r\nThe emperor raised her tenderly. \"Be comforted; for if you cry so\r\nbitterly my courtiers will think that I have been unkind to you. You\r\ntold me just now that you wished to know the name of your protector that\r\nyou might pray for him. Well, my child, pray for me--my name is Joseph.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nROSARY AND SCEPTRE.\r\n\r\nThe four weeks to which Maria Theresa had limited her novitiate had\r\nalmost expired. She still secluded herself from the world, and, in the\r\ndeep retirement of her palatial cloister, would suffer no mention of\r\nworldly affairs in her presence.\r\n\r\nIn vain her confessor and her attendants strove to awaken her interest\r\nto the dissatisfaction of the people with the wild projects of reform\r\nthat threatened the subversion of all social order. From the day of her\r\nretirement, Maria Theresa had forbidden the slightest allusion to\r\npolitics. Her confesser had on one occasion ventured a hint on the\r\nsubject of the changes which were being made by the emperor, but the\r\nempress had turned her flashing eyes upon him, and had reminded him\r\nthat, as the servant of the Lord, he was there to exhort and to pray,\r\nnot to concern himself about the trivialities of this world.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion the Countess Fuchs had presumed to mention the\r\nchanges in the imperial household. The empress interrupted her coldly,\r\nsaying that if she had not lost her relish for the vanities of the\r\ncourt, the countess must absent herself until further orders.\r\n\r\nThis severity had put an end to all plans for inducing the empress to\r\nresume the cares of empire. She was now at liberty to weep and pray\r\nwithout distraction. Even her children, who came daily to kiss her hand,\r\nwere allowed no conversation but that which turned upon religion. When\r\nthe morning services were ended, they silently withdrew to their rooms.\r\n\r\nFor a few days past, the Archduchess Christina had absented herself from\r\nthis mournful levee. On the first day of her nonappearance the empress\r\nhad not appeared to remark her absence. But on the second day her eyes\r\nwandered sadly from her prayer book to her children, and her lips seemed\r\nready to frame some question. Instead of speaking, she bent her head\r\nover her rosary, and strove to pray with more devotion than usual.\r\n\r\nFinally came a third day, and still Christina was absent. The empress\r\ncould no longer master her maternal anxiety, and as the Archduchess\r\nElizabeth approached to kiss her hand, she spoke. \"Where is Christina?\r\nWhy is she not with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"My sister is sick, your majesty,\" replied the archduchess. And as\r\nthough she feared to displease her mother by further speech, she bent\r\nher head and withdrew.\r\n\r\nThe next day when the imperial children entered their mother's\r\napartment, her prayer-book was lying on the table, while she, pale and\r\nagitated, was pacing the room with hasty steps. She received her family\r\nwith a slight motion of her head, and looked anxiously toward the door,\r\nuntil it had closed after the entrance of little Marie Antoinette. Then\r\nthe empress sighed, and turned away her head lest her children should\r\nsee the tears that were gushing from her eyes.\r\n\r\nBut when mass was over, and little, Marie Antoinette approached her\r\nmother, she took the child up in her arms, and tenderly kissing her\r\ncheek, said: \"How is Christina, my darling?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sister Christina is very sick, imperial mamma,\" replied the child, \"and\r\nshe cries all day long. But she loves you very dearly, and longs to see\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress put down her little daughter without a word, and as if she\r\nthought to mortify her worldliness, she signed to all present to\r\nwithdraw, and falling upon her knees, prayed long and fervently. An hour\r\nor two after she sent for her confessor. As he left her room and passed\r\nthrough the anteroom, the attendants saw that his countenance looked\r\njoyous in the extreme. They flocked to hear if there was any hope of\r\nconvincing the empress of the necessity of her return to the world.\r\n\r\n\"I think there is much,\" replied the father. \"God be thanked, her\r\nmaternal love has overcome the dangerous lethargy into which sorrow had\r\nplunged our beloved sovereign. For a time she was overcome by her grief\r\nas a widow; but she begins to feel that her children have a right to her\r\ncounsels and care. Later she will recognize the claims of her people and\r\nAustria will be saved from the mad schemes of that unbelieving dreamer,\r\nher son.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you really believe that her majesty will return to the throne'?\"\r\nasked the countess.\r\n\r\n\"I do. She besought me in trembling tones to tell her something of her\r\nbeloved child--and I did nothing to tranquillize her, --for she has no\r\nright to seclude herself from her people. Maria Theresa is a greater\r\nsovereign than her son will ever be, and Austria cannot afford to lose\r\nher now. She will visit her daughter to-day. Tell the archduchess not to\r\nfear her brother's opposition; for her mother, once resolved to return\r\nto her people, will see that her own daughters are not made wretched by\r\na tyrannical brother. The princess will marry her lover.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hasten. How soon may we expect the empress?\"\r\n\r\n\"She will surely be there before many hours. Solitude is not congenial\r\nto Maria Theresa's heart; her active mind craves occupation, and her\r\ngrief requires it. Let us appeal to her affections through the illness\r\nof her child, and complete reaction will ensue. If once we can persuade\r\nher to quit her seclusion, the cloister-dream is over. Let us all work\r\nin concert to restore her to the world. It is not the sovereign of a\r\ngreat nation who has a right like Mary to sit at the feet of Jesus. Go\r\nat once, Count Bathiany, and may God bless the efforts we are making to\r\nrestore our empress to her sense of duty. Church and state are alike\r\nendangered by the fatal step she has taken.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ABBESS AND AN EMPRESS.\r\n\r\nIT was the hour of dinner. Complete silence reigned throughout the\r\nimperial palace, except in the halls and stairways that led from the\r\nimperial dining-hall to the kitchens below. Both lay far from the\r\napartments of the empress-abbess. She, therefore, felt that she could\r\nvisit her child without fear of observation. She had just concluded her\r\nown solitary dinner, and was trying to collect her thoughts for prayer.\r\nIn vain. They WOULD wander to the sick-bed of her daughter, whom fancy\r\npictured dying without the precious cares that a mother's hand alone is\r\ngifted to bestow. Maria Theresa felt that her heart was all too\r\nstorm-tossed for prayer. She closed her book with a pang of\r\nself-reproach, and rose from her arm-chair.\r\n\r\n\"It is useless,\" said she, at last. \"I must obey the call of my\r\nrebellious heart, and tread once more the paths of earthly love and\r\nearthly cares. I cannot remain here and think that my Christina longs\r\nfor her mother's presence, and that I may not wipe her tears away with\r\nmy kisses. It is my duty to tend my sick child. I am not in the right\r\npath, or a merciful God would strengthen me to tread it courageously. I\r\nmust replace their father to my children. Poor orphans! They need twice\r\nthe love I gave before, and, God forgive me, I was about to abandon them\r\nentirely. It is no injury to the memory of my Francis, for, through his\r\nchildren, I shall but love him the more. How I long once more to press\r\nthem to my heart! Yes, I must go, and this is the hour. I will pass by\r\nthe private corridors, and surprise my Christina in her solitude.\"\r\n\r\nWith more activity than she bad been able to summon to her help since\r\nthe emperor's burial, Maria Theresa to her dressing-room, and snatching\r\nup her long, black cloak, threw it around her person. As she was drawing\r\nthe hood over her face, she caught a glimpse of herself in a mirror\r\nclose by. She was shocked at her own image; her face so corpse-like, her\r\ncloak so like a hideous pall.\r\n\r\n\"I look like a ghost,\" thought the empress. \"And indeed I am dead to all\r\nhappiness, for I have buried my all! But Christina will be shocked at my\r\nlooks. I must not frighten the poor child.\"\r\n\r\nAnd actuated partly by maternal love, partly by womanly vanity, Maria\r\nTheresa slipped back the ugly hood that hid her white forehead and\r\nopened the black crape collar which encircled her neck, so that some\r\nportion of her throat was visible.\r\n\r\n\"I will always be my Franz's poor widow,\" said the empress, while she\r\narranged her toilet, \"but I will not affright my children by my\r\ndress--now I look more like their mother. Let me hasten to my child.\"\r\n\r\nAnd having again flung back the hood so that some portions of her\r\nbeautiful hair could be seen, she left the room. She opened the door\r\nsoftly and looked into the next apartment. She had well calculated her\r\ntime, for no one was there; her ladies of honor had all gone to dinner.\r\n\r\n\"That is pleasant,\" said she. \"I am glad not to meet their wondering\r\nfaces; glad not to be greeted as an empress, for I am an empress no\r\nlonger. I am a poor, humble widow, fulfilling the only earthly duties\r\nnow left me to perform.\"\r\n\r\nShe bent her head and went softly through the second anteroom to the\r\nhall. Again, all was empty and silent; neither page, nor sentry, nor\r\nlackey to be seen. She knew not why, but a feeling of desolation came\r\nover her. She had bidden adieu to the etiquette due to her rank, but\r\nthis, she thought, was carrying the point too far.\r\n\r\n\"If I had had the misfortune to fall suddenly ill,\" said she, \"I must\r\nhave called in vain for succor. No one is by to hear my voice. But at\r\nleast there must be sentries in the other hall.\" No! That hall too was\r\nempty. No lackeys were there, no guards! For the first time in her life,\r\nMaria Theresa was out of hearing of any human being, and she felt a pang\r\nof disappointment and humiliation. She started at the sound of her own\r\nfootsteps, and walked faster, that she might come within sight of some\r\none-any one. Suddenly, to her joy, she heard the sound of voices, and\r\npaused to listen.\r\n\r\nThe door of the room whence the voices were heard was slightly ajar, and\r\nthe empress overheard the following conversation. The speakers were\r\nFather Porhammer and the Countess Fuchs. \"Do not despair,\" said the\r\nfather; \"the empress is forgiving and magnanimous; and when she shall\r\nhave admitted you again to her presence, it will be your duty to aid all\r\nthose who love Austria, by using your influence to recall her majesty to\r\nthe throne. Woe to Austria if she persists in elevating her grief above\r\nher duty as a sovereign! Woe to the nation if her son, that rebellious\r\nchild of the church, reign over this land! His insane love of novelty--\"\r\n\"For Heaven's sake, father,\" replied the countess, \"say nothing against\r\nthe emperor! His mother's will has placed him on the throne, and we must\r\nsubmit.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress heard no more. With noiseless tread she hurried on, until\r\nshe turned the corner of a side-hall and then she relaxed her pace. She\r\npondered over what she had just heard, and it did not contribute to\r\ntranquillize her mind.\r\n\r\n\"What can he be doing?\" thought she.\" What are those mad schemes of\r\nwhich my friends have tried to apprise me? He was ever self-willed and\r\nstubborn; ever inclined to skepticism. Alas! alas! I foresee sad days\r\nfor my poor Austria!\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment the empress had gained a small landing which led to a\r\nstaircase which she had to descend. She was about to proceed on her way\r\nwhen she perceived a man, whose back was turned toward her, seated on\r\nthe topmost step. He was so quiet that she thought he was asleep. But as\r\nher foot touched him he turned carelessly round, and perceiving the\r\nempress, rose slowly, and bent his head as though to any lady whom he\r\nmight pass.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa was astonished. She knew not what to think of the\r\nirreverent bearing of this man, who was no other than Stockel, one of\r\nthe servants whose duty it had been, for thirty years, to light the\r\nfires in her dressing-room.\r\n\r\nHe had been accustomed every morning to appear before his imperial lady,\r\nin winter, to see that her fires were burning; in summer, to distribute\r\nher alms. Steckel was from Tyrol, he had been a favorite servant of the\r\nempress; and being an upright and intelligent man, his word was known to\r\nhave some weight with her. [Footnote: Thiebault, \"Memoires de Vlugt\r\nAns.\"] Stockel had been the most respectful and loyal of servants; the\r\nappearance alone of the empress had always made his old wrinkled face\r\nlight up with joy. How did it happen that now, when he had been parted\r\nfrom her for four weeks, he seemed indifferent?\r\n\r\n\"He is offended because I have never sent for him,\" thought the\r\nkind-hearted empress;' \"I must try to appease him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to see you, Stockel,\" said she, with one of her own\r\nbewitching smiles; \"it is long since you have visited me in my room. I\r\nam such a poor, sorrowing widow, that I have not had heart enough to\r\nthink of the poverty of others.\"\r\n\r\nSteckel said nothing. He turned and slightly shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"How?\" said Maria Theresa good-humoredly, \"are you offended? Have you\r\nthe heart to be angry with your empress?\"\r\n\r\n\"Empress?\" returned Stockel; \"I took your highness for a pious nun. The\r\nwhole world knows that Maria Theresa is no longer an empress; she no\r\nlonger reigns in Austria.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa felt a pang as she heard these words, and her cheeks\r\nflushed--almost with anger. But overcoming the feeling she smiled sadly\r\nand said: \"I see that you are really angry, poor Stockel. You do not\r\nlike to see my palace made a cloister. You think, perhaps, that I have\r\ndone wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not pretend to judge of the acts of the rulers of earth,\" replied\r\nhe gloomily. \"Perhaps the deeds which in ordinary people would be called\r\ncowardly, may with them be great and noble. I know nothing about it; but\r\nI know what my beloved empress once said to me. She was then young and\r\nenergetic, and she had not forgotten the oath she had taken when the\r\narchbishop crowned her at St. Stephen's--the oath which bound her to be\r\na faithful ruler over her people until God released her.\"\r\n\r\n\"What said your empress then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell your highness. I had lost my young wife, the one I loved\r\nbest on earth, and I came to beg my discharge; for my longing was to go\r\nback to my native mountains and live a hermit's life in Tyrol. My\r\nempress would not release me. `How!' said she, 'are you so weak that you\r\nmust skulk away from the world because Almigthy God has seen fit to\r\nbereave you of your wife? He tries your faith, man, and you must be\r\nfirm, whether you face the storm or bask in the sunshine. Did you not\r\npromise to serve me faithfully, and will you now cast away your useful\r\nlife in vain sorrow? What would you think of me were I so lightly to\r\nbreak my oath to my people--I who must lift my head above every tempest\r\nof private sorrow, to fulfill my vow until death,' Thus spoke my\r\nempress; but that was many years ago, and she was then sovereign of all\r\nAustria.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa looked down, and the tear-drops that had been gathering in\r\nher eyes fell upon her black dress, where they glistened like diamonds.\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" whispered she, \"I was sovereign of all Austria.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what prevents you from being sovereign to-day?\" asked Stockel\r\neagerly. \"Have your people released you?\"\r\n\r\nThe empress waved her hand impatiently. \"Enough,\" said she, \"let me go\r\nmy way!\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have a petition to make, and as it is the last favor I shall ever\r\nask, I hope your majesty will not deny me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak your wish,\" replied Maria Theresa hastily.\r\n\r\n\"I beg of your majesty to allow me to quit your service,\" replied the\r\nman moodily. \"I cannot forget the words of Maria Theresa. I will not\r\nskulk away from the world while I have strength to work. I am tired of\r\nthe idle life I lead. It is summer, and there is no fire to kindle. As\r\nfor the poor unfortunates whom I used to visit, I can do them no good;\r\ntheir benefactress is no more. I must do something, or life will be a\r\nburden; and if your majesty will condescend to give me leave, I shall\r\nseek another place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another place, Stockel!\" said the empress. \"What other place?\"\r\n\r\n\"A place in the household of the REIGNING empress,\" answered Stockel\r\nwith a low inclination.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa raised her head, and her astonishment was visible in her\r\nlarge, open eyes.\r\n\r\n\"The reigning empress?\" said she musing. \"Who can that be?\"\r\n\r\n\"The wife of the reigning emperor, your majesty,\" said Stockel grimly.\r\n\r\nThe empress threw back her proud head, and drew her mantle convulsively\r\naround her.\r\n\r\n\"It is well,\" said she, \"Come to me to-morrow, and you shall hear my\r\ndecision.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE REIGNING EMPRESS.\r\n\r\nThe empress went slowly down the staircase. This staircase led to the\r\nleft wing of the palace, where the apartments of the imperial children\r\nwere situated. From earliest childhood the daughters of Maria Theresa\r\nhad had each one her separate suite. Each one had her governess, her\r\nladies of honor, and her train of servants, and lived as if in a\r\nminiature court.\r\n\r\nOn great festivals, national or domestic, the younger members of the\r\nimperial family were invited to the table of the empress; otherwise they\r\nate in private with their retinue, and each child had a separate table.\r\n\r\nIt was now the dinner-hour, and Maria Theresa had selected it, because\r\nshe felt sure that all the attendants of her children were at table, and\r\nno one would know of her visit to Christina. But she was mistaken. As\r\nshe passed by the anteroom leading to the apartments of her children,\r\nshe heard the voices of the lords and ladies in waiting, and through the\r\nhalf-opened door, saw them chatting together in groups. They did not\r\nseem to observe their ex-sovereign; they went on conversing as if\r\nnothing had happened. But as the empress was passing the apartments of\r\nlittle Marie Antoinette, her governess appeared, and, with a cry of joy,\r\nthrew herself at Maria Theresa's feet, and covered her hand with kisses.\r\nThe empress smiled. A thrill of pleasure ran through her frame, as she\r\nreceived the homage to which from her birth she had been accustomed.\r\n\r\n\"Rise, countess,\" said she, kindly, \"and do not let Marie Antoinette\r\nknow that I am near. But, tell me, how comes it that at this hour I find\r\nthe retinue of my children at leisure, while they are at table?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are at leisure, your majesty,\" replied the countess, \"because we are\r\nwaiting for their highnesses to rise from the table.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it then a festival, that my children should be dining at the\r\nimperial table?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please your majesty, the reigning emperor has abolished the private\r\ntables of their highnesses your children. He finds it cheaper and more\r\nconvenient for all the members of the imperial family to be served at\r\nonce and at one table.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where, then, do my children dine?\" asked the empress, with asperity.\r\n\r\n\"En famille, with her imperial majesty, the reigning empress.\"\r\n\r\n\"The reigning empress!\" echoed Maria Theresa, with a frown. \"But how\r\ncomes it that my children leave their rooms without a retinue? Have you,\r\nthen, already forgotten that I never permit a breach of court-ceremonial\r\non any account?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please your majesty, the emperor dislikes etiquette, and he has\r\nstrictly forbidden all Spanish customs as laughable and ridiculous. He\r\nhas forbidden all attendance upon the imperial family, except on new\r\nyear's day. He has also forbidden us to kneel before his majesty,\r\nbecause it is an outlandish Spanish custom, and a homage due to God\r\nalone. All the French and Italian servants of the palace are dismissed,\r\nand their places are supplied by natives. The emperor wishes to have\r\nevery thing at his court essentially German. For that reason he has\r\nordered the mass to be translated and celebrated in the German\r\nlanguage.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress heaved a sigh, and drew her mantilla over her face, as if to\r\nshut out the future which was unrolling itself to her view. She felt\r\nsick at heart; for she began to comprehend that her successor was not\r\nonly creating a new order of things, but was speaking with contempt of\r\nhis mother's reign. But she would not comtemplate the sad vision; she\r\nstrove to turn back her thoughts to the present.\r\n\r\n\"But if you no longer have your private table,\" continued she, \"why not\r\naccompany the princesses?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the emperor deems it fitting that the imperial family should\r\ndine alone. We, ladies in waiting, dine in a small room set apart for\r\nus, and then return to our apartments to await their highnesses.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the lords in waiting, do they not dine with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty, they have received orders at one o'clock to go to\r\ntheir own houses, or to their former lodgings to dine. The court table\r\nis abolished, and the emperor finds that by so doing he has economized a\r\nvery considerable sum.\"\r\n\r\nA deep flush of anger passed over the face of Maria Theresa, and her lip\r\ncurled contemptuously. Economy was one of the few virtues which the\r\nprofuse and munificent empress had never learned to practise. She\r\nconsidered it beneath the dignity of a sovereign to count the cost of\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n\"Enough,\" said she, in a constrained voice, \"I will go to Christina. Let\r\nno one know of my visit. I desire to see my sick daughter alone.\"\r\n\r\nShe bent her lofty head, and walked rapidly away. With a beating heart\r\nshe opened the door that led to the sleeping-room of the princess. There\r\non a couch lay a pale, weeping figure, the empress's darling, her\r\nbeautiful Christina.\r\n\r\nShe stopped for a moment on the threshold, and looked lovingly at the\r\ndear child, whom, for four days, she had not seen; then a thrill of\r\nunutterable joy pervaded her whole being. At this moment Christina\r\nraised her languid eyes; her glance met that of her mother; and with a\r\npiercing cry, she sprang from the couch. But, overcome by weakness and\r\nemotion, she faltered, grew paler, and sank to the floor.\r\n\r\nThe empress darted forward and caught her fainting daughter in her arms.\r\nShe carried her to the divan, laid her softly down, and, with quivering\r\nlip, surveyed the pale face and closed eyes of the princess.\r\n\r\nShe recovered slowly, and at length, heaving a deep sigh unclosed her\r\neyes. Mother and child contemplated each other with loving glances, and\r\nas the archduchess raised her arms and clasped them around her mother's\r\nneck, she whispered feebly: \"Oh, now, all is well! I am no longer\r\ndesolate; my dear, dear mother has returned to me. She has not forsaken\r\nus; she will shield us from oppression and misfortune.\"\r\n\r\nLike a frightened dove Christina clung to the empress, and burying her\r\nface in her mother's breast, she wept tears of relief and joy.\r\n\r\nThe empress drew her close to her heart. \"Yes, darling,\" said she, with\r\nfervor, \"I am here to shield you, and I will never forsake you again. No\r\none on earth shall oppress you now. Tell me, dear child, what goes wrong\r\nwith you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, mother, \"whispered Christina, \"there is one in Austria, more\r\npowerful than yourself, who will force me to his will. You cannot shield\r\nme from the emperor, for you have given him the power to rule over us;\r\nand, oh, how cruelly he uses his right!\"\r\n\r\n\"What I have given, I can recall, \"cried the empress. \"Mine are the\r\npower and the crown, and I have not yet relinquished them. Now speak,\r\nChristina; what grieves you, and why are your eyes so red with weeping?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I am the most unhappy of mortals,\" cried Christina,\r\npassionately. \"Because I am denied the right which every peasant-girl\r\nexercises; the right of refusing a man whom I do not love. Oh, mother,\r\nif you can, save me from the detested Duke of Chablais,--whom my cruel\r\nbrother forces upon me as a husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that your sorrow, my child?\" exclaimed the empress. \"Joseph is like\r\nhis father; he loves wealth. The emperor had proposed this half-brother\r\nof the King of Sardinia for you, Christina, but I refused my consent;\r\nand, now without my knowledge, Joseph would force him upon you, because\r\nof his great riches. But patience, patience, my daughter. I will show\r\nyou that I am not so powerless as you think; I will show you that no one\r\nin Austria shall give away my Christina without her mother's\r\napprobation.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the empress spoke, her cheeks flushed, and her eyes glowed with a\r\nproud consciousness of might not yet renounced forever. The sorrowing\r\nwidow was being once more transformed into the stately sovereign, and\r\nthe eyes, which had been so dimmed by tears, were lit up by the fire of\r\nnew resolves.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, mother, my own imperial mother,\" said Christina, \"do not only free\r\nme from the man whom I detest, but bless me with the hand of the man I\r\nlove. You well know how long I have loved Albert of Saxony, you know how\r\ndear I am to him. I have sworn never to be the wife of another, and I\r\nwill keep my oath, or die! Oh, mother, do not make me the sport of\r\npolicy and ambition! Let me be happy with him whom I love. What are\r\ncrowns and sceptres and splendor, when the heart is without love and\r\nhope? I am willing to lead a simple life with Albert--let me be happy in\r\nmy own way. Oh, mother! I love him so far above all earthly creatures,\r\nthat I would rather be buried with him in the grave than be an empress\r\nwithout him.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she fell upon her knees and wept anew. The empress had listened\r\nmusingly to her daughter's appeal. While Christina was speaking, the\r\nglamour of her own past love was upon her heart.\r\n\r\nShe was a girl again; and once more her life seemed bound up in the love\r\nshe bore to young Francis of Lorraine. Thus had she spoken, so had she\r\nentreated her father, the proud emperor, until he had relented, and she\r\nhad become the wife of Christina's own father! Not only maternal love,\r\nbut womanly sympathy pleaded for her unhappy child.\r\n\r\nShe bent over her, and with her white hand fondly stroked the rich\r\nmasses of Christina's golden-brown hair.\r\n\r\n\"Do not weep, my daughter,\" said she tenderly. \"True, you have spoken\r\nwords most unseemly for one of your birth; for it is the duty of a\r\nprincess to buy her splendor and her rank with many a stifled longing\r\nand many a disappointment of the affections. Kind fate bestowed upon me\r\nnot only grandeur, but the husband of my love, and daily do I thank the\r\ngood God who gave me to my best beloved Franz. I do not know why you,\r\ntoo, may not be made a happy exception to the lot of princesses. I have\r\nstill four beautiful daughters for whom state policy may seek alliances.\r\nI will permit one of my children to be happy as I have been. God grant\r\nthat the rest may find happiness go hand in hand with duty.\"\r\n\r\nThe princess, enraptured, would have thrown her arms around her mother's\r\nneck; but suddenly, her face, which had grown rosy with joy, became pale\r\nagain, and her countenance wore an expression of deep disappointment.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, mother,\" cried she, \"we build castles, while we forget that you are\r\nno longer the sovereign of Austria. And while you weep and pray in your\r\ndark cell, the emperor, with undutiful hand, overturns the edifice of\r\nAustria's greatness--that edifice which you, dearest mother, had reared\r\nwith your own hands. He is like Erostratus; his only fame will be to\r\nhave destroyed a temple which he had not the cunning to build.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will wrest the fagots from his sacrilegious hands,\" cried the\r\nempress.\r\n\r\nThe archduchess seemed not to have heard her mother's words She threw\r\nher arms around the empress, and, clinging convulsively to her,\r\nexclaimed, \"Oh, do, not forsake me, my mother and my empress. That\r\nhorrible woman, who was dragged from her obscurity to curse my brother's\r\nlife; that tiresome, hideous Josepha--do not suffer her to wear your\r\ntitle and your crown. O God! O God! Must I live to see Maria Theresa\r\nhumbled, while Josepha of Bavaria is the reigning empress of Austria?\"\r\n\r\nThe empress started. This was the third time she had heard these words,\r\nand each time it seemed as if a dagger had pierced her proud heart.\r\n\r\n\"Josepha of Bavaria the reigning empress of Austria!\" said she\r\nscornfully. \"We shall see how long she is to bear my title and wear my\r\ncrown! But I am weary, my daughter. I must go to my solitude, but fear\r\nnothing. Whether I be empress or abbess, no man on earth shall oppress\r\nmy children. The doors of the cloister have not yet closed upon me; I am\r\nstill, if I choose to be, the reigning empress of Austria.\"\r\n\r\nShe pressed a kiss upon Christina's forehead, and left the room.\r\n\r\nOn her return she encountered no one, and she was just about to open the\r\ndoor of her own anteroom, when she caught the sound of voices from\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\n\"But I tell you, gentlemen,\" cried an angry voice, \"that her majesty,\r\nthe ex-empress, receives no one, and has no longer any revenues. She has\r\nnothing more to do with the administration of affairs in Austria.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I must see the empress,\" replied a second and a deprecating voice.\r\n\"It is my right, for she is our sovereign, and she cannot so forsake us.\r\nLet me see the empress. My life depends upon her goodness.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" cried a third voice, \"I too must see her. Not for myself do I\r\nseek this audience, but for her subjects. Oh, for the love of Austria,\r\nlet me speak with my gracious sovereign!\"\r\n\r\n\"But I tell you that I dare not,\" cried the ruffled page. \"It would ruin\r\nme not only with her majesty, but with the reigning emperor. The widowed\r\nempress has no more voice in state affairs, and the emperor never will\r\nsuffer her to have any, for he has all the power to himself, and he\r\nnever means to yield an inch of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Woe then to Austria!\" cried the third speaker.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you cry, 'Woe to Austria?'\" asked a voice outside; and the tall,\r\nmajestic form of the empress appeared at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Our empress!\" cried the two petitioners, while both fell at her feet\r\nand looked into her voice with unmistakeable joy.\r\n\r\nThe empress greeted them kindly, but she added: \"Rise, gentlemen. I hear\r\nthat my son, the emperor, has forbidden his subjects to kneel to him;\r\nthey shall not, therefore, kneel to me, for he is right. To God alone\r\nbelongs such homage. Rise, therefore, Father Aloysius; the brothers of\r\nthe holy order of Jesus must never kneel, to fellow-mortal. And you,\r\nCounsellor Bundener, rise also, and stand erect. Your limbs have grown\r\nstiff in my service; in your old age you have the right to spare them.\r\nYou,\" added she, turning to the page, \"return to your post, and attend\r\nmore faithfully to your duty than you have done to-day. When I left this\r\nroom, no one guarded the entrance to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty,\" stammered the confused page, \"it was the dinner-hour,\r\nand I had never dreamed of your leaving your apartments. His majesty the\r\nemperor has reduced the pages and sentries to half their number, and\r\nthere are no longer enough of us to relieve one another as we were\r\naccustomed to do under the reign of your majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is well,\" said the empress haughtily. \"I will restore order to my\r\nhousehold before another day has passed. And now, gentlemen, what brings\r\nyou hither? Speak, Father Aloysius.\"\r\n\r\n\"My conscience, your majesty,\" replied Father Aloysius, fervently. \"I\r\ncannot stand by and see the hailstorm of corruption that devastates our\r\nunhappy country. I cannot see Austria flooded with the works of French\r\nphilosophers and German infidels. What is to become of religion and\r\ndecency if Voltaire and Rousseau are to be the teachers of Austrian\r\nyouth!\"\r\n\r\n\"It rests with yourself, my friend,\" replied the empress, \"to protect\r\nthe youth of Austria from such contaminating influences. Why do those\r\nwhom I appointed censors of the press permit the introduction of these\r\ngodless works in my realms?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty's realms!\" replied the father sadly. \"Alas, they are no\r\nlonger yours. Your son is emperor and master of Austria, and he has\r\ncommanded the printing and distribution of every infidel work of modern\r\ntimes. The censors of the press have been silenced, and ordered to\r\ndiscontinue their revision of books.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has my son presumed so far?\" cried the empress, angrily. \"Has he dared\r\nto overthrow the barriers which for the good of my subjects I had raised\r\nto protect them from the corrupt influences of French infidelity? Has be\r\nordered the dissemination of obscene and ungodly books? O my God! How\r\nculpable have I been to the trust which thou hast placed in my hands! I\r\nfeel my guilt; I have sinned in the excess of my grief. But I will\r\nconquer my weak heart. Go in peace, father. I will ponder your words,\r\nand to-morrow you shall hear from me.\"\r\n\r\nThe father bowed and retired, while the empress turned toward Counsellor\r\nBundener and inquired the cause of his distress.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, your majesty,\" cried the old man in accents of despair, \"unless you\r\nhelp me I am ruined. If you come not again to my assistance my children\r\nwill starve, for I am old and--\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" interrupted the empress, \"your children starve with the pension\r\nI gave you from my own private purse?\"\r\n\r\n\"You did, indeed, give me a generous pension,\" replied Bundener, \"and\r\nmay God bless your majesty, for a more bountiful sovereign never bore\r\nthe weight of a crown. But desolation and despair sit in the places\r\nwhere once your majesty's name was mingled each day with the prayers of\r\nthose whom you had succored. The emperor has withdrawn every pension\r\nbestowed by you. He has received a statement of every annuity paid by\r\nyour majesty's orders, and has declared his intention of cleaning out\r\nthe Augean stables of this wasteful beneficence.\" [Footnote: Hubner,\r\n\"Life of Joseph II.,\" vol. i., p. 28.]\r\n\r\nThe empress could not suppress a cry of indignation. Her face grew\r\nscarlet, and her lips parted. But she conquered the angry impulse that\r\nwould have led her to disparage her son in the presence of his subject,\r\nand her mouth closed firmly. With agitated mien she paced her apartment,\r\nher eyes flashing, her breast heaving, her whole frame convulsed with a\r\nsense of insulted maternity. Then she came toward the counsellor, and\r\nlifting her proud head as though Olympus had owned her sway, she spoke:\r\n\r\n\"Go home, my friend,\" said she imperiously, \"and believe my royal word\r\nwhen I assure you that neither you nor any other of my pensioners shall\r\nbe robbed of your annuities. Princely faith shall be sacred above all\r\nconsideration of thrift, and we shall see who dares impeach mine!\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Maria Theresa passed into her dressing-room, where her ladies\r\nof honor were assembled. They all bent the knee as she entered, and\r\nawaited her commands in reverential silence. At that moment the flourish\r\nof trumpets and the call of the guards to arms were heard. The empress\r\nlooked astounded, and directed an inquiring glance toward the window.\r\nShe knew full well the meaning of that trumpet signal and that call to\r\narms; they were heard on the departure or the return of one person only\r\nin Austria, and that person was herself, the empress.\r\n\r\nFor the third time the trumpet sounded. \"What means this?\" asked she,\r\nfrowning.\r\n\r\n\"Please your majesty,\" answered a lady of the bedchamber, \"it signifies\r\nthat her imperial majesty, the reigning empress, has returned from her\r\nwalk in the palace gardens.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa answered not a word. She walked quickly past her\r\nattendants and laid her hand upon the lock of the door which led into\r\nher private study. Her head was thrown back, her eyes were full of\r\nflashing resolve, and the tone of her voice was clear, full, and\r\nmajestic. It betokened that Maria Theresa was \"herself again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let Prince Kaunitz be summoned,\" said she. \"Send hither the Countess\r\nFuchs and Father Porhammer. Tell the two latter to come to my study when\r\nthe prince leaves it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE CO-REGENT DEPOSED.\r\n\r\nScarcely a quarter of an hour had elapsed since the empress's orders had\r\nbeen issued, when a page announced Prince Kaunitz.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa went forward to receive him. Her whole being seemed filled\r\nwith a feverish excitement which contrasted singularly with the\r\nunaltered demeanor of her prime minister, who, cold and tranquil as\r\never, advanced to meet his sovereign, and bowed with his usual phlegm.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Maria Theresa, after a pause, \"every thing has not changed\r\nin the four weeks of my retirement from court. You at least are the same\r\nin appearance. Let me hope that you are the same in spirit and in mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please your majesty,\" replied Kaunitz, \"four weeks have not yet gone by\r\nsince I had the honor of an interview with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" asked the empress, impatiently. \"Do you wish\r\nto remind me that I had resolved to wait four weeks before I decided\r\nupon a permanent course of action?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty,\" said Kaunitz. \"I am somewhat vain, as everybody\r\nknows, and I have already seen my triumph in your majesty's face. I read\r\nthere that my noble empress has proved me a true prophet. She has not\r\nyet been away from her subjects four weeks, and already her head has\r\nsilenced the weakness of her heart. Three weeks have sufficed to bring\r\nMaria Theresa once more to her sense of duty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said the empress, \"are you then so sure that my novitiate will not\r\nend in a cloister?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am convinced of it. For never shall I forget the day on which your\r\nmajesty swore to be a faithful ruler over Austria as long as you lived.\r\nI am convinced of it, too, because I know that, although my empress has\r\nthe heart of a woman, she has the head of a man, and in all well-ordered\r\nunions the head rules the household.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress smiled faintly, but said nothing. Her arms were crossed over\r\nher breast, her head was bent in thought, and she went slowly back and\r\nforth from one end of her study to the other. Kaunitz followed her with\r\nhis large, tranquil eyes, which seemed to penetrate to the remotest\r\nregions of her throbbing heart.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she stood before him, and for a moment gazed earnestly in his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"Kaunitz,\" said she, \"I have not only considered you for many years as a\r\nwise and great statesman, but, what is better yet, I have esteemed you\r\nas a man of honor. I exact of you that you act honorably and openly\r\ntoward me in this hour. Do you promise?\"\r\n\r\n\"An honorable man, your majesty, need not promise to do that which honor\r\nrequires of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, true. But you might pay unconscious deference to my rank or to my\r\nsex. Courtesy might mislead you. This is precisely what I warn you to\r\navoid. I wish you to speak candidly without thought or consideration for\r\nempress or woman. Remember how you pledged your life to Austria's\r\ngood--and, forgetting all else, answer me truthfully and without fear.\r\nWill you, Kaunitz?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, your majesty. Ask, and you shall be truthfully answered--so\r\nhelp me God.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, tell me, which of us is better calculated to reign in\r\nAustria--Joseph or myself? Which of us will best promote the welfare of\r\nthe Austrian people? Do not answer me at once. Take time to reflect upon\r\nthe subject, for a, weighty question lies in the balance of this hour. I\r\ncannot trust myself in this decision, for I have wept so many tears that\r\nI have not the strength to see wherein my duty lies. I cannot even trust\r\nmy own misgivings, for pride or vanity may have blinded my eyes to\r\ntruth. I am not sure that I view things in their proper light. It is\r\nuseless, therefore, for me to speak. I desire to hear no one but\r\nyourself. I swear to you by the memory of Charles V., that, whatever you\r\nsay shall be sacred; for I have exacted of you candor--and say what you\r\nwill, your candor shall not offend. Who, then, is best fitted to reign,\r\nJoseph or I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty, I have had full time to reflect upon this weighty\r\nquestion; for since first you announced your intention to resign the\r\nthrone, I have thought of nothing else. In politics we know neither\r\npredilection nor prejudice. Necessity and interest decide all things.\r\nYour majesty has so often called me a good politician, that I have ended\r\nby believing myself to be one. It follows thence that, in deliberating\r\nupon this great question, I have laid aside all personal inclination and\r\nsympathy, and have had in view the welfare of Austria alone. But for\r\nthis, the matter would have required no thought, for the Emperor Joseph\r\nand I have nothing in common. He fears me, and I do not love him.\r\n[Footnote: Kaunitz's own words. Wrazall, vol. ii., p. 490.] We never\r\ncould be made to understand one another; for the language of the heart\r\nis not to be forced by edicts, as is the language of the court. The\r\nemperor has forbidden all tongues in Germany, save one. If he persist in\r\nthis, he will alienate his subjects, and Austria will soon lose her\r\ngreatness. When a titan intends to force his people to forget their\r\nmother-tongue, he must do it by degrees; and if he succeeds, he will be\r\na skilful teacher. The best reforms are to be introduced through the\r\nbyways of life. If we trust them on the highway, they shock and terrify\r\nthe people. The young emperor, regardless of these considerations, has\r\nviolently suppressed whatever seemed injudicious to him in your\r\nmajesty's administration. Perhaps you had done too much; your son,\r\ncertainly, does too little. I hear everywhere of interdicts, but nowhere\r\nof concessions. Old things destroyed, but nothing created to replace\r\nthem. What will be the result of this? Austria must soon be reduced to a\r\nmass of ruins, and your son will go down to posterity with a fame like\r\nthat of Attila. Save Austria! save him from the curse that threatens\r\nboth. We have not yet completed the noble edifice of which eleven years\r\nago we laid the foundations. We must finish the structure, and so solid\r\nmust be its walls that our thoughtless young reformer shall not have\r\nstrength to batter them down. Your majesty must remain the reigning\r\nEmpress of Austria. You cannot resign your empire to your son. Duty and\r\nthe welfare of your subjects forbid it.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress inclined her head approvingly. \"I believe that you are\r\nright, Kaunitz,\" replied she. \"It is not in the pride, but in the deep\r\nhumility of my heart, that I reassume the crown which God himself placed\r\nupon my head. I have no right to say that the load is too heavy since He\r\nwills me to bear it. Indeed I feel that He will give me strength to\r\naccomplish His will in me, and I am now ready to say, 'Behold the\r\nhandmaid of the Lord; be it done to me according to His word.' I will\r\nnever again lift my treasonable hand against that crown which I pray\r\nHeaven I may wear for the good of my people. But you, prince, you must\r\nbe at my side; together we have planned for Austria, together we must\r\ncomplete the noble structure of her greatness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I remain, your majesty, and will never cease to labor until the banner\r\nof the Hapsburg floats proudly from its battlements. But we must\r\ndecorate as well as strengthen. We have beautiful young princesses whose\r\nalliances will bring wealth and splendor to our imperial edifice.\r\nWithin, we shall have solid walls that will insure the durability of our\r\nstructure; without, we shall have brilliant alliances that will perfect\r\nits beauty.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have a marriage to propose?\" said the empress, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"I have, your majesty, a marriage with the young King of Naples.\"\r\n\r\n\"For which of my daughters?\" asked Maria Theresa uneasily.\r\n\r\n\"For the one your majesty shall select.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it shall be Johanna. She is very beautiful, and has a proud and\r\nambitious heart which craves less for love than for rank and splendor.\r\nBut if I give one of my daughters to diplomacy, you must leave me\r\nanother for domestic happiness. Christina has undertaken to think that\r\nshe must marry for love, and I think we ought to make her happy in her\r\nown modest way. We owe amends to Albert of Saxony for having declined an\r\nalliance with his sister; we also owe him something for his fidelity and\r\ngood faith as an ally. Let the young lovers be united, then; we have\r\ngold and daughters enough to tolerate one marriage of inclination in our\r\nimperial house.\"\r\n\r\n\"But your majesty will give up the youngest, Marie Antoinette, to\r\ndiplomacy, will you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"You destine her to the throne of France, prince--is it not so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty. The son of the dauphin is a noble youth, and\r\nalthough his father was unfriendly to Austria, Choiseuil and La\r\nPompadour are for us. Marie Antoinette, therefore, is to be Queen of\r\nFrance. This, however, must be a profound secret between ourselves.\r\nWhile her little highness is being fashioned for her future dignity, we\r\nmust marry her elder sisters, if not so brilliantly, at least as\r\nadvantageously as we can. First, then, upon the list is the Archduchess\r\nChristina. We must find some suitable rank for herself and her husband,\r\nand your majesty will of course bestow a dowry worthy of your daughter's\r\nbirth and station.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will present them the duchy of Teschen as a wedding-gift, and it must\r\nbe your care, prince, to find an appointment for the Elector of Saxony\r\nthat will be worthy of my son-in-law.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us name him Captain-General and Stadtholder of Hungary. That will\r\nbe an effectual means of converting the Hungarians into Austrians, and\r\nthe appointment is in every way suitable to the elector's rank.\" The\r\nempress nodded, smiling acquiescence. \"Your head,\" said she, \"is always\r\nin the right place; and sometimes I cannot help thinking that your heart\r\nis better than the world believes it to be, else how could you so\r\nreadily divine the hearts of others? How quickly have you devised the\r\nbest of schemes to promote my daughter's happiness, without compromising\r\nher imperial station! Christina shall be Stadthalterin of Hungary; and\r\nin her name and my own I thank you for the suggestion. One thing,\r\nhowever, lies heavy on my heart. It is the thought of the blow I am\r\nabout to inflict upon my poor Joseph. How will he bear to be deprived of\r\nhis sovereignty?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think your majesty named him co-regent only,\" said Kaunitz.\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" replied the empress, \"and in very truth I withdraw nothing but\r\na temporary privilege. As empress I know my right to resume the reins of\r\npower; but it grieves my maternal heart to exercise it. I think I see\r\nhim now, poor boy, with his great blue eyes fixed in despair upon me. I\r\nnever shall have the courage to announce my return to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"There will be no need to restrict him in his co-regency. He can be\r\nremoved to the war department, where he may reign unfettered.\"\r\n\r\n\"He shall have unlimited power there,\" exclaimed the empress, joyfully.\r\n\"It is the proper province of a man, and Joseph will fill the station\r\nfar better than I have ever done. I promise not to interfere with him in\r\nthe field. For other state affairs, I shall attend to them myself, and I\r\ndo not think that I will ever delegate my power a second time. You had\r\nbest inform Joseph of my resumption of the throne, and let the Frau\r\nJosepha also be advised that she is no longer reigning empress of\r\nAustria. For me, I must always remain at heart a sorrowing widow. My\r\nsorrows I can never overcome; my widow's weeds I shall never lay aside.\r\n[Footnote: She kept her word. Every month, on the day of her husband's\r\ndeath, she spent the day in solitary prayer and on every yearly\r\nanniversary of her widowhood, she knelt for hours by the side of the\r\nemperor's tomb, praying for the repose of his soul. Her private\r\napartments were ever after hung with gray, and her coaches and liveries\r\nwere of the same sad hue.--Caroline Pichler, \"Memoirs.\"] But above the\r\nweeds I will wear the mantle of royalty; and since you have so\r\ndetermined for me, Austria shall once more own the sway of Maria\r\nTheresa. \"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nMOTHER AND SON.\r\n\r\nThe dream was over--the blessed dream of philanthropy and reform! The\r\nreins of power had been snatched from his hands, and Joseph was once\r\nmore consigned to a life of insignificant inactivity. Like a wounded\r\nbird, whose broken wing no longer bears him aloft his heart fluttered\r\nand fell--its high hopes dashed to earth. The old influences which he\r\nhated, were at work again, and he had no recourse but absolute silence.\r\nHis deep humiliation, he was constrained to hide under a mask of\r\nserenity; but he knew that his spirit was crushed, and night fell over\r\nhis stricken soul. Still, he struggled against the chill of his despair,\r\nand with all the strength of his being he strove against misfortune.\r\n\r\n\"I will not succumb,\" thought he, \"I will not be vanquished by this\r\nsecret grief. I will not be a cause of sorrow to my friends and of\r\ntriumph to my enemies--I will live and overpower misfortune. Since all\r\nin Vienna is so dark, let me seek sunshine elsewhere--I will\r\ntravel!--Away from this stifling court, to breathe the free air of\r\nheaven! Here I am an emperor without an empire; there at least I shall\r\nbe a man, to whom the world belongs, wherever his steed has strength and\r\nspeed to bear him. Yes, let me travel, that I may gird up my loins for\r\nthe day when the sun of royalty shall rise for me. It will come! it will\r\ncome! And when it dawns, it must find me strong, refreshed, and ready\r\nfor action.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor made his preparations to depart, and then, in compliance\r\nwith the requisitions of court etiquette, he sought his mother, to\r\nobtain her consent to his journey. Maria Theresa received her son with\r\nthat half-mournful tenderness which lent such an indescribable\r\nfascination to her appearance and manners. She looked at him with a\r\nsmile so winning and affectionate, that Joseph, in spite of himself,\r\nfelt touched and gladdened; and the hand which his mother held out was\r\nmost fervently pressed to his lips. It was the first time they had met\r\nin private since the empress had reascended her throne, and both felt\r\nthe embarrassment and significance of the hour.\r\n\r\n\"I have longed for this moment with anxious and beating heart, my son,\"\r\nsaid the mother, while she drew him toward her. \"I know, my child, that\r\nyour heart is embittered toward me. You think that I would have been\r\nwiser as well as kinder had I never left my widow's cloister. But\r\nreflect, my dear son, as I have done, that my sceptre was given me by\r\nthe hand of God, and that it would be sinful and cowardly in me to give\r\nit into the hands of another until He, in His wisdom, releases me from\r\ndurance.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph looked with genuine emotion at the agitated countenance of his\r\nmother. He saw the tears gather and fall from her eyes; he saw the\r\nquivering lip, the trembling frame; he felt that her integrity was\r\nbeyond suspicion, her love for him beyond all question. The icy barriers\r\nthat had closed upon his heart, gave way; he felt the warm and sunny\r\nglow of a mother's unspeakable love, and, yielding to the impulse of the\r\nmoment, he flung his arms around the empress's neck, while he covered\r\nher face with kisses. \"Mother, my dear mother!\" sobbed he; and as if\r\nthese words had opened the floodgates of all the love which filled his\r\nheart, he leaned his head upon her bosom, and was silent.\r\n\r\nShe smiled fondly upon him as he lay there; she returned his kisses, and\r\nstroked his fair, high forehead with her loving hand.\r\n\r\n\"Have you come back once more to your mother's heart, my darling?\"\r\nwhispered she. \"Have you found your way back to the nest whence you have\r\nwandered away so long, you stray birdling? Do you feel, my son, that the\r\nmother's bosom is the resting-place for her children? Oh! promise me, my\r\nheart's treasure, to trust and love me from this hour? We are human, and\r\ntherefore we are sinful and erring. I well know, dear boy, that I have\r\nmany failings. From my heart I regret them; and if in your short life,\r\nas boy or man, I have grieved you, pardon me, dearest, for I have not\r\nmeant it in unkindness.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, mother,\"' said Joseph, \"it is I who should sue for pardon. My heart\r\nis wild and stubborn; but I believe that it beats with a love as true\r\nand warm for my empress as that of any other man in Austria. Have\r\npatience with me, then, my mother, for I am indeed a wandering bird;\r\nand, in my wild flight, the shafts of this life have wounded and maimed\r\nme. But let us not speak of life--mine is a blasted one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my son, let us speak of your life, and of its misfortunes; for I\r\nknow that Josepha of Bavaria is its chiefest sorrow. I have heard\r\nsomething of your unhappiness as a husband, and I pity you both.\"\r\n\r\n\"You pity her!\" cried Joseph, hastily. \"How does she deserve my mother's\r\ncompassion?\"\r\n\r\nThe empress laid her hand gently upon her son's shoulder. \"She loves\r\nyou, Joseph,\" said she, \"and I cannot refuse my sympathy to a woman who\r\nloves without hope of return.\"\r\n\r\n\"She loves me!\" exclaimed Joseph with a laugh of derision. \"Yes--and her\r\nlove is my abhorrence and my shame. Her ogling glances make me shudder\r\nwith disgust. When she turns upon me her blotched and pimpled face, and\r\ncalls me by the name of husband, the courtiers sneer, and I--I feel as\r\nif I would love to forget my manhood and fell her to the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is certainly ugly,\" said the empress, shaking her head, \"but uglier\r\nwomen than she have inspired love. And remember, Joseph, that you chose\r\nher yourself. Besides, she has an excellent heart, if you would but take\r\nthe trouble to explore its unknown regions. Moreover, you will one day\r\nbe sole Emperor of Austria, and you should seek to give an heir to your\r\nthrone. If Josepha were the mother of your children, you would no longer\r\nthink her ugly.\"\r\n\r\n\"SHE the mother of my children!\" cried Joseph, with such keenness of\r\nhate, that the empress shuddered. \"Do you think me capable of such a\r\ndegradation? You have not seen Van Swieten lately, or he would have told\r\nyou that this woman, in addition to her other attractions, is troubled\r\nwith a new malady.\"\r\n\r\n\"Van Swieten did not mention it to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, your majesty, I will mention it. This so-called empress has\r\nthe scurvy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my son, my poor boy!\" cried the empress, putting her arm around\r\nJoseph's neck as though she would have shielded him from infection.\r\n\"That is a disgusting malady, but Van Swieten's skill will soon conquer\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but neither he nor you will ever conquer my hate for her. Not all\r\nthe world could make me forgive the deception that was practised upon me\r\nwhen she was allowed to become my wife. THIS woman the mother of my\r\nchildren! No! No one shall ever force me to be the father of any thing\r\nborn of Josepha of Bavaria!\"\r\n\r\nThe empress turned away and sighed. It was in vain. This was hatred\r\nstrong as death. \"May God comfort you both!\" said she, mournfully.\r\n\r\n\"Then He must put us asunder!\" cried out Joseph, almost beside himself.\r\n\"Believe me, mother,\" continued he, \"death alone can bring us\r\nconsolation; and may God forgive me when I pray that this atoning angel\r\nmay come to my relief! She or I! No longer can I bear this ridicule of\r\nhearing this leper called an empress!\"\r\n\r\n\"Travel, then, my dear son,\" said his mother. \"Travel and try to enjoy\r\nlife away from Vienna. Perchance when you will have seen how little true\r\nhappinesss there is on earth, experience may come to your help, and\r\nteach you to be less unhappy.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor shook his head. \"Nothing,\" replied he, moodily, \"can ever\r\nconsole me. Wherever I go, I shall hear the rattle of my prisoner's\r\nchain. Let us speak of it no more. I thank your majesty for the\r\npermission to leave Vienna, and I thank you for this bright and sacred\r\nhour, whose memory will bless me as long as I live. You have been to me\r\nthis day a tender and sympathizing mother. May I henceforward be to you\r\na grateful and obedient son.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have not yet told me whither you desire to travel,\" said the\r\nempress, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\"With your majesty's permission, I would wish to travel in Bohemia and\r\nMoravia, and then I wish to visit the courts of Dresden and Munich. Both\r\nsovereigns, through their ambassadors, have sent me urgent invitations.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be uncourteous to refuse,\" said the empress, earnestly. \"It is\r\npolitic for us, as far as possible, to bind all the German princes to us\r\nby interchange of kindness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since this is your majesty's opinion, I hope that you will also consent\r\nto my acceptance of a third invitation. The King of Prussia has\r\nrequested to have an interview with me at Torgau.\"\r\n\r\nThe brow of the empress darkened.\r\n\r\n\"The King of Prussia?\" said she, almost breathless.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty, and to be frank with you it is of all my invitations\r\nthe one which I most desire to accept. I long to see face to face the\r\nking whom all Europe, friend or foe, unites in calling 'Frederick the\r\nGreat'--great not only as a hero, but also as a lawgiver.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" cried the empress, with indignation, \"the king whom infidels\r\ndelight to honor. I never supposed that he would presume to approach my\r\nson and heir as an equal. The Margrave of Brandenburg has a right to\r\nhold the wash-basin of the Emperor of Germany, but methinks he forgets\r\nhis rank when he invites him to an interview. \"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, your majesty,\" replied Joseph, smiling, \"the Margrave of\r\nBrandenburg, to our sorrow and our loss, has proved himself a king; in\r\nmore than one battle has he held the wash-basin for Austria's sovereign,\r\nbut it was to fill it with Austrian blood.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa grew more and more angry as she heard these bold words.\r\n\"It ill becomes my son,\" said she, \"to be the panegyrist of the victor\r\nwhose laurels were snatched from his mother's brow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Justice impels me to acknowledge merit, whether I see it in friend or\r\nfoe,\" answered the emperor. \"Frederick of Prussia is a great man, and I\r\nonly hope that I may ever resemble him.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress uttered an exclamation, and her large eyes darted lightning\r\nglances.\r\n\r\n\"And thus speaks my son of the man who has injured and robbed his\r\nmother!\" exclaimed she indignantly. \"My son would press his hand who has\r\nspilled such seas of Austrian blood--would worship as a hero the enemy\r\nof his race! But so long as I reign in Austria, no Hapsburger shall\r\ncondescend to give the hand to a Hohenzollern. There is an old feud\r\nbetween our houses; it cannot be healed.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if there is feud, your majesty perceives that it is not the fault\r\nof the King of Prussia, since he holds out the right hand of friendship.\r\nI think it much more Christian-like to bury feuds than to perpetuate\r\nthem. Your majesty sees, then, how Frederick has been calumniated, since\r\nhe follows the Christian precept which commands us to forgive our\r\nenemies.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish to have nothing to do with him,\" said the empress.\r\n\r\n\"But, as I had the honor of saying before, the king has sent me a\r\npressing invitation, and you said just now that it would be uncourteous\r\nto refuse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the invitation of Frederick. I will not consent to that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not even if I beg it as a favor to myself?\" asked Joseph fervently.\r\n\"Not even if I tell you that I have no wish so near at heart as that of\r\nknowing the King of Prussia? Think of this day, so brightened to me by\r\nthe sunshine of your tenderness! Let the mother plead for me with the\r\nsovereign; for it is not to my empress, it is to my mother that I\r\nconfide my hopes and wishes. Oh, do not drown the harmony of this hour\r\nin discord! Do not interpose a cloud between us now.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress threw back her head. \"You threaten me, sir, with your\r\ndispleasure? If there are clouds between us, see that they disperse from\r\nyour own brow, and show me the face of a loyal subject and a respectful\r\nson. I will not consent to this visit to the King of Prussia; the very\r\nthought of it is galling to my pride.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that your majesty's last word?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is my last.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I have nothing further to say, except that, as in duty bound, I\r\nwill obey the orders of my sovereign,\" replied Joseph, turning deathly\r\npale. \"I shall refuse the invitation of the King of Prussia, and beg\r\nleave to retire.\"\r\n\r\nWithout awaiting the answer of his mother, he bowed, and hastily left\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\"Dismissed like a school-boy,\" muttered he, while tears of rage flowed\r\ndown his cheeks. \"Two chains on my feet--the chains of this accursed\r\nmarriage, and the chains of my filial duty, impede my every step. When I\r\nwould advance, they hold me back and eat into my flesh. But it is of no\r\nuse to complain, I must learn to bear my fate like a man. I cannot rebel\r\nopenly, therefore must I be silent. But my time will come!\"\r\n\r\nHe raised his head proudly, and with a firm step took the way to his\r\nprivate apartments. He went at once into his study, where, on his\r\nwriting-desk, lay the letter of the King of Prussia.\r\n\r\nThe emperor seated himself at the desk, and, with a heavy sigh, took up\r\nhis pen. \"Tell the king, your master,\" wrote he, \"that I am not yet my\r\nown master; I am the slave of another will. But I will find means some\r\nday to atone for the rudeness which I have been forced to offer him in\r\nreturn for his kindness.\" [Footnote: Hubner, \"Life of Joseph II.,\" vol.\r\ni., p. 87.--Gross-Hofflinger, vol. 1., p. 116.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nDEATH THE LIBERATOR.\r\n\r\nThe cruel enemy which had laid low so many branches of the noble house\r\nof Hapsburg, had once more found entrance into the imperial palace at\r\nVienna. This terrific invisible foe, which, from generation to\r\ngeneration, had hunted the imperial family with such keen ferocity, was\r\nthe small-pox. Emperors and Empresses of Austria had been its victims,\r\nand almost every one of Maria Theresa's children bore, sooner or later,\r\nits brand upon their faces. This fiend had robbed them of the fair\r\nIsabella; and now its envenomed hand was laid upon the affianced bride\r\nof the King of Naples. The beautiful young Johanna was borne to the\r\nvaults of the Capuchins, while in the palace its inmates were\r\npanic-stricken to hear that Josepha of Bavaria, too, had taken the\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\nWith such lightning swiftness had the venom darted through the veins of\r\nthe unhappy empress, that her attendants had fled in disgust from the\r\npestiferous atmosphere of her chamber.\r\n\r\nAnd there, with one hired nurse, whom the humane Van Swieten had\r\nprocured from a hospital, lay the wife of the Emperor of Austria.\r\n\r\nNo loving hand smoothed the pillow beneath her burning head or held the\r\ncooling cup to her blood-stained lips; no friendly voice whispered words\r\nof sympathy; no familiar face bent over her with looks of pity.\r\n\r\nAlone and forsaken, as she had lived, so must she die! At his first\r\nwife's bedside Joseph had watched day and night; but Josepha's he did\r\nnot approach. In vain had she sent each day, through Van Swieten, a\r\npetition to see him, if only once; Joseph returned, for all answer, that\r\nhis duty to his mother and sisters forbade the risk.\r\n\r\nAnd there lay the woman whose princely station mocked her misery; there\r\nshe lay unpitied and unloved. The inmates of the palace hurried past the\r\ninfected room, stopping their breathing as they ran: the daughters of\r\nMaria Theresa never so much as inquired whether their abhorred\r\nsister-in-law were living or dead.\r\n\r\nBut the poor dying empress was not even alone with her misery. Memory\r\nwas there to haunt her with mournful histories of her past life: pale,\r\ntearful, despairing were these ghosts of an existence uncheckered by one\r\nray of happiness. Ah, with what a heart full of trembling hope had she\r\nentered the walls of this palace, which to her had proved a prisoner's\r\ncell! With what rapture had she heard the approaching step of that\r\nhigh-born emperor, her husband, on their wedding-night; and oh, how\r\nfearful and how swift had fallen the bolt of his vengeance upon her sin!\r\nMemory whispered her of this.\r\n\r\nShe thought of the Emperor Francis, of his tender sympathy with her\r\nsorrow; she remembered how he had conspired with her on that fatal night\r\nat Innspruck. Then she remembered her husband's scorn, his withering\r\ninsults, and her loss of consciousness. She thought how she had been\r\nfound on the floor, and awakened by the terrifying intelligence of the\r\nemperor's sudden death. Her tears, her despair, she remembered all; and\r\nher wail of sorrow at the loss of her kindest friend. [Wraxall, vol.\r\nii., page 411.] Memory whispered her of this.\r\n\r\nShe thought of her dreary life from that day forward: forever the\r\nshrinking victim of Christina's sneers, because she, and not the sister\r\nof Albert of Saxony, had become the emperor's wife. Even the\r\nkind-hearted Maria Theresa had been cold to her; even she, so loving, so\r\naffectionate, had never loved Josepha. And the wretched woman thought\r\nhow one day when the imperial family had dined together, and her\r\nentrance had been announced as that of \"Her majesty, the reigning\r\nempress,\" the archduchesses had sneered, and their mother had smiled in\r\nderision. Memory whispered her of this. [Footnote: Hubner, \"Life of\r\nJoseph II.,\" p. 27.]\r\n\r\nShe thought how her poor, martyred heart had never been able to give up\r\nall hope of love and happiness; how day by day she had striven, through\r\nhumility and obedience, to appease her husband's anger. But he had\r\nalways repulsed her. One day she had resolved that he SHOULD see her.\r\nShe knew that the emperor was in the daily habit of sitting on the\r\nbalcony which divided her apartments from his. She watched his coming,\r\nand went forward to meet him. But when he saw her, in spite of her tears\r\nand supplications, with a gesture of disgust, he left the balcony and\r\nclosed the window that led to it. The next day, when she ventured a\r\nsecond time on the balcony, she found it separated by a high partition,\r\nshutting out all hope of seeing her husband more. And she remembered\r\nhow, one day afterward, when she stepped out upon it, and her husband\r\nbecame aware of her presence, he had, in sight of all the passers-by,\r\nstarted back into his room, and flung down his window with violence.\r\n[Footnote: Caroline Pichler, \"Memoirs,\" vol. i., p. 182.] Memory\r\nwhispered her of this.\r\n\r\nBut now that she had expiated her first fault by two years of bitter\r\nrepentance, now that death was about to free him from her hated presence\r\nforever, surely he would have mercy, and forgive her the crime of having\r\ndarkened his life by their unhappy union.\r\n\r\nOh, that once more she could look into the heaven of those deep-blue\r\neyes! That once more before she died she could hear the music of that\r\nvoice, which to her was like the harmony of angels' tongues!\r\n\r\nIn vain! Ever came Van Swieten with the same cold message--\"The emperor\r\ncannot compromise the safety of his relatives.\"\r\n\r\nAt last, in the energy of despair, Josepha sat erect in her bed, and\r\nwith her livid, bloody hands, wrote a letter which Van Swieten, at her\r\nearnest entreaty, delivered to the emperor.\r\n\r\nWhen, after a short absence, he returned with another denial, she gave\r\nsuch a shriek of anguish that it was heard throughout the palace.\r\n\r\nVan Swieten, overwhelmed by pity for the poor martyr, felt that he must\r\nmake one more effort in her behalf. He could do nothing for her: bodily,\r\nshe was beyond his power to heal; but he was resolved to be the\r\nphysician of her broken heart, and, if it lay within the power of man,\r\nto soothe and comfort her dying moments.\r\n\r\nWith the letter which Joseph had returned to him, he hastened to the\r\nEmpress Maria Theresa. To her he pictured the agony of her dying\r\ndaughter-in-law, and besought her to soften the emperor's heart.\r\n\r\nThe empress listened with deep emotion to the long-tried friend of her\r\nhouse. Tears of sympathy gathered in her eyes, and fell over her pale\r\ncheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Joseph will not grant her request, because he fears the infection for\r\nus?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty, that is his pretext.\"\r\n\r\n\"He need not fear for me, and he can remain at a distance from the other\r\nmembers of the family,\" said Maria Theresa. \"But I know what are his\r\nreal sentiments. He hates Josepha, and it is his hatred alone that\r\nprevents him from granting her petition. He has a hard, unforgiving\r\nheart, he never will pardon his wife--not even when she lies cold in her\r\ngrave.\"\r\n\r\n\"And she will not die until she has seen him,\" returned Van Swieten,\r\nsadly. \"It seems as if she had power to keep off death until the last\r\naim of her being has been reached. Oh, it is fearful to see a soul of\r\nsuch fire and resolution in a body already decaying.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress shuddered. \"Come, Van Swieten,\" said she, resolutely, \"I\r\nknow how to force Joseph to the bedside of his poor, dying wife.\"\r\n\r\nShe rose, and would have gone to the door, but Van Swieten, all ceremony\r\nforgetting, held her back.\r\n\r\n\"I will call the emperor myself,\" said he; \"whither would your majesty\r\ngo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not detain me,\" cried the empress, \"I must go to the emperor.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what then?\" asked Van Swieten, alarmed.\r\n\r\nThe empress, who had already crossed her anteroom, looked back with a\r\ncountenance beaming with noble energy.\r\n\r\n\"I will do my duty,\" replied she. \"I will do what Christian feeling\r\nprompts. I will go to Josepha.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty, no,\" cried Van Swieten, again laying hands upon his\r\nsovereign. \"You owe it to your people and your children not to expose\r\nyourself to danger.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress smiled sadly. \"Doctor, where did Isabella and Johanna take\r\nthe infection? God called them to Himself, and God has shielded me, If\r\nit pleases Him that I also shall suffer this fearful scourge, it will\r\nnot be from contagion. It will be from His divine hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, your majesty, it will be my fault,\" cried Van Swieten. \"On my\r\nhead will be the sin.\"\r\n\r\n\"I free you from all responsibility,\" replied she, \"and say no more; for\r\nit is my duty to visit this deserted woman's death-bed. I have been less\r\nkind to her than I should have been, and less indulgent than on MY\r\ndeath-bed I will wish to have been. I have not been a tender mother to\r\nher, living--let me comfort her, at least, now that she is dying.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she has not asked for your majesty,\" persisted Van Swieten.\r\n\"Wherefore--\"\r\n\r\nBut suddenly he stopped, and a cry of horror was stifled between his\r\nlips. He had seen upon the forehead and cheeks of the empress those\r\nsmall, dark spots which revealed to his experienced eye that it was too\r\nlate to shield her from infection.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa was too excited to remark the paleness of Van Swieten. She\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\"Go to Joseph, and tell him that I await him at the death-bed of his\r\nwife. He will not dare refuse her now. Go, doctor, we must both do our\r\nduty.\"\r\n\r\nVan Swieten stepped aside, for he had blocked the door.\r\n\r\n\"Go, your majesty,\" said he, almost inaudibly. \"I will not detain you,\r\nbut will see the emperor.\" He turned away, sick at heart. \"One empress\r\ndying, and another!--O God! grant me help that I may save my beloved\r\nMaria Theresa!\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the empress hurried through the deserted halls of the palace\r\nto the room of the unhappy Josepha. As she approached the door, she\r\nheard her voice in tones of bitterest anguish. The sound filled the\r\nheart of Maria Theresa with deepest sympathy and sorrow.\r\n\r\nFor one moment she stood irresolute; then, gathering all her strength,\r\nshe opened the door, and went in. At the foot of the bed knelt two\r\nUrsuline nuns, those angels of mercy who are ever present to comfort the\r\ndying. The entrance of the empress did not interrupt their prayers. They\r\nknew that no one could rescue the dying woman; they were praying Heaven\r\nto comfort her departing soul.\r\n\r\nBut was she comforted? She ceased her lamentations, and now lay still.\r\nShe had heard the door open, and had struggled to rise; but she was too\r\nweak, and sank back with a groan.\r\n\r\nBut she had seen the empress, who, with the courage of a noble spirit,\r\nhad conquered her disgust, and advancing to the bed, bent over Josepha\r\nwith a sweet, sad smile. Josepha saw it, and the empress looked more\r\nbeautiful to her dying eyes than she had ever looked before.\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, my poor daughter,\" whispered she, in broken accents. \"I\r\ncome to give you a mother's blessing, and to beg of Almighty God to give\r\nyou peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Peace, peace!\" echoed the sufferer, while the empress, with a shudder\r\nsurveyed her black and bloated face.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she uttered a cry, and opened her arms. \"He comes! he comes!\"\r\ncried she; and her dying eyes unclosed with a ray of joy.\r\n\r\nYes, he came--he, whom she had so longed to see.\r\n\r\nWhen Van Swieten told him that the empress had gone to Josepha's room,\r\nhe started from his seat, and hurried through the corridor with such\r\nwild speed that the physician had been unable to follow him.\r\n\r\nHastily approaching the bed, he put his arms gently around his mother,\r\nand sought to lead her away.\r\n\r\n\"Mother,\" said he, imploringly, \"leave this room. It is my duty to be\r\nhere, not yours. Bid adieu to the Empress Josepha, and go hence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, oh!\" groaned Josepha, falling back upon her pillow, \"he does not\r\ncome for my sake, but for his mother's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Josepha,\" replied Joseph, \"I am here for your sake also, and I\r\nshall remain with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I also will remain,\" said Maria Theresa. \"This sacred hour shall unite\r\nin love those who so long have been severed by error and\r\nmisapprehension. Life is a succession of strivings to do well, and\r\nrelapses into wrong. We feel that we have erred toward you, and we come\r\nwith overflowing hearts to crave forgiveness. Forgive us, Josepha, as\r\nyou hope to be forgiven!\"\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me also, Josepha,\" said Joseph, with genuine emotion. \"Let us\r\npart in peace. Forgive me my obduracy, as from my soul I forgive you. We\r\nhave both been unhappy--\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" interrupted Josepha, \"I have not been unhappy; for I--I have\r\nloved. I die happy; for he whom I love no longer turns abhorrent from my\r\npresence. I shall die by the light of your pardoning smile. Death, that\r\ncomes every moment nearer, death, to me, brings happiness. He comes with\r\nhis cold kiss, to take my parting breath--the only kiss my lips have\r\never felt. He brings me love and consolation. He takes from my face the\r\nhideous mask which it has worn through life; and my soul's beauty, in\r\nanother world, shall win me Joseph's love. Oh death, the comforter! I\r\nfeel thy kiss. Farewell, Joseph, farewell!\"\r\n\r\n\"Farewell!\" whispered Joseph and Maria Theresa.\r\n\r\nA fearful pause ensued--a slight spasm--a gasp--and all was over.\r\n\r\n\"She is released!\" said Van Swieten. \"May her soul rest in peace!\"\r\n\r\nThe Ursulines intoned the prayers for the dead, and Maria Theresa, in\r\ntears, clasped her hands and faltered out the responses. Suddenly she\r\nreeled, heaved a sigh, and fell back in the emperor's arms.\r\n\r\n\"My mother, my dear mother!\" cried he, terrified.\r\n\r\nVan Swieten touched him lightly. \"Do not arouse her. Yonder sleeps the\r\none empress in death--her pains are past; but this one, our beloved\r\nMaria Theresa, has yet to suffer. May God be merciful and spare her\r\nlife!\"\r\n\r\n\"Her life!\" cried Joseph, turning pale.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, her life,\" said Van Swieten, solemnly. \"The empress has the\r\nsmall-pox.\" [Footnote: The Empress Josepha died May 28, 1767, at the age\r\nof twenty nine years. Her body was so decayed by small pox, that, before\r\nher death the flesh fell from her in pieces. It was so completely\r\ndecomposed, that it was impossible to pay it the customary funeral\r\nhonors. It was hurriedly wrapped up in a linen cloth, and coffined. From\r\nthese circumstances a rumor prevailed in Bavaria that she had not died,\r\nbut had been forced into a cloister by her husband.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nTHE MIRROR.\r\n\r\nSix fearful weeks had gone by--six weeks of anxiety, suspense, and care,\r\nnot only for the imperial family, but for all Austria.\r\n\r\nLike the lightning flash, intelligence had gone through the land that\r\nthe empress was in danger, and her subjects had lost interest in every\r\nthing except the bulletins issued from the palace where Van Swieten and\r\nVon Storck watched day and night by the bedside of their beloved\r\nsovereign. Deputations were sent to Vienna, sympathizing with the\r\nemperor, and the avenues to the palace were thronged with thousands of\r\nanxious faces, each waiting eagerly for the bulletins that came out four\r\ntimes a day.\r\n\r\nAt last the danger passed away. Van Swieten slept at home, and the\r\nempress was recovering.\r\n\r\nShe had recovered. Leaning on the arm of the emperor, and surrounded by\r\nher happy children, Maria Theresa left her widow's cell to take up her\r\nabode in the new and splendid apartments which, during her\r\nconvalescence, Joseph had prepared for her reception.\r\n\r\nShe thanked her son for his loving attention, so contrary to his usual\r\nhabits of economy, and therefore so much the more a proof of his earnest\r\ndesire to give pleasure to his mother. She, in her turn, sought to give\r\nstrong expression to her gratitude, by admiring with enthusiasm all that\r\nhad been done for her. She stopped to examine the costly Turkey carpets,\r\nthe gorgeous Gobelin tapestries on the walls, the tables carved of\r\nprecious woods, or inlaid with jewels and Florentine mosaic, the rich\r\nfurniture covered with velvet and gold, the magnificent lustres of\r\nsparkling crystal, and the elegant trifles which here and there were\r\ntastefully disposed upon etageres or consoles.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, my son,\" cried the empress, surveying the beautiful suite, \"you\r\nhave decorated these rooms with the taste and prodigality of a woman. It\r\nadds much to my enjoyment of their beauty to think that all this is the\r\nwork of your loving hands. But one thing has my princely son forgotten;\r\nand therein he betrays his sex, showing that he is no woman, but in very\r\ntruth a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I forgotten something, your majesty?\" asked Joseph.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; something, my son, which a woman could never have overlooked.\r\nThere are no mirrors in my splendid home.\"\r\n\r\n\"No mirrors!\" exclaimed Joseph, looking confused. \"No--yes --indeed,\r\nyour majesty is right, I had forgotten them. But I beg a thousand\r\npardons for my negligence, and I will see that it is repaired. I shall\r\norder the costliest Venetian mirrors to be made for these apartments.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Joseph spoke, his mother looked earnestly at his blushing face,\r\nand perfectly divined both his embarrassment and its cause. She turned\r\nher eyes upon her daughters, who, with theirs cast down, were sharing\r\ntheir brother's perplexity.\r\n\r\n\"I must wait then until my mirrors are made,\" said the empress, after a\r\npause. \"You must think that I have less than woman's vanity, my son, if\r\nyou expect me to remain for weeks without a greeting from my\r\nlooking-glass. Of course the small-pox has not dared to disfigure the\r\nface of an empress; I feel secure against its sacrilegious touch. Is it\r\nnot so, my little Marie Antoinette? Has it not respected your mother's\r\ncomeliness?\"\r\n\r\nThe little archduchess looked frightened at the question, and timidly\r\nraised her large eyes. \"My imperial mamma is as handsome as ever she\r\nwas,\" said the child, in a trembling voice.\r\n\r\n\"And she will always be handsome to us, should she live until old age\r\nshall have wrinkled her face and paled her cheeks,\" cried Joseph warmly.\r\n\"The picture of her youthful grace and beauty is engraved upon our\r\nhearts, and nothing can ever remove it thence. To the eyes of her\r\nchildren a noble and beloved mother is always beautiful. \"\r\n\r\nThe empress said nothing in reply. She smiled affectionately upon her\r\nson, and inclining her head kindly to the others, retired to her\r\nsitting-room. She walked several times up and down, and finally\r\napproached her mirror. In accordance with an old superstition, which\r\npronounces it ill-luck to allow a looking-glass in the room of a sick\r\nperson, this large mirror had been covered with a heavy silk curtain.\r\nThe empress drew it back; but instead of her looking-glass, she was\r\nconfronted by a portrait of her late husband, the emperor. She uttered\r\nan exclamation of surprise and joy, and contemplated the picture with a\r\nhappy smile. \"God bless thee, my Franz, my noble emperor!\" whispered\r\nshe. \"Thou art ever the same; thy dear smile is unaltered, although I am\r\nno longer thy handsome bride, but a hideous and disfigured being, from\r\nwhom my children deem it fit to conceal a looking-glass. Look at me with\r\nthy dear eyes, Franz; thou wert ever my mirror, and in thy light have I\r\nseen my brightest day of earthly joy. My departed beauty leaves me not\r\none pang of regret, since thou art gone for whom alone I prized it.\r\nMaria Theresa has ceased to be a woman--she is nothing more than a\r\nsovereign, and what to her are the scars of the small-pox? But I must\r\nsee what I look like,\" said she, dropping the curtain. \"I will show them\r\nthat I am not as foolish as they imagine.\"\r\n\r\nShe took up her little golden bell and rang. The door of the next room\r\nopened, and Charlotte von Hieronymus entered. The empress smiled and\r\nsaid: \"It is time to make my toilet. I will dine to-day en famille with\r\nthe emperor, and I must be dressed. Let us go into my dressing-room.\"\r\n\r\nThe maid of honor courtesied and opened the door. Every thing there was\r\nready for the empress. The tire-woman, the mistress of the wardrobe, the\r\nmaids of honor were all at their posts; and Charlotte hastened to take\r\nher place behind the large arm-chair in which the empress was accustomed\r\nto have her hair dressed.\r\n\r\nBut Maria Theresa saw that she had not been expected in her\r\ndressing-room, for her cheval-glass was encumbered with shawls, dresses,\r\nand cloaks. She took her seat, smilingly saying to herself, \"I shall see\r\nmyself now, face to face.\"\r\n\r\nCharlotte passed the comb through the short hair of the empress, and\r\nsighed as she thought of the offering that had been laid in the\r\nemperor's coffin; while the other maids of honor stood silent around.\r\nMaria Theresa, usually so familiar and talkative at this hour, spoke not\r\na word. She looked sharply at the cheval-glass, and began carelessly,\r\nand as if by chance, to remove with her foot, the dresses that\r\nencumbered it; then, as if ashamed of her artifice, she suddenly rose\r\nfrom the chair, and with an energetic gesture unbared the mirror.\r\n\r\nNo mirror was there! Nothing greeted the empress's eyes save the empty\r\nframe. She turned a reproachful glance upon the little coiffeuse.\r\n\r\nCharlotte fell upon her knees, and looked imploringly at the empress.\r\n\"It is my fault, your majesty,\" said she, blushing and trembling; \"I\r\nalone am the culprit. Pardon my maladroitness, I pray you?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, child?\" asked the empress.\r\n\r\n\"I--I broke the looking-glass, your majesty. I stumbled over it in the\r\ndark, and shivered it to pieces. I am very, very awkward--I am very\r\nsorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! You overturned this heavy mirror!\" said Maria Theresa. \"If so,\r\nthere must have been a fearful crash. How comes it that I never heard\r\nany thing--I who for six weeks have been ill in the adjoining room?\"\r\n\r\n\"It happened just at the time when your majesty was delirious with\r\nfever; and--\"\r\n\r\n\"And this mirror has been broken for three weeks!\" said Maria Theresa,\r\nraising her eyebrows and looking intently at Charlotte's blushing face.\r\n\"Three weeks ago! I think you might have had it replaced, Charlotte, by\r\nthis time; hey, child?\"\r\n\r\nCharlotte's eyes sought the floor. At length she stammered, in a voice\r\nscarcely audible, \"Please your majesty, I could not suppose that you\r\nwould miss the glass so soon. You have made so little use of mirrors\r\nsince--\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough of this nonsense,\" interrupted the empress. \"You have been well\r\ndrilled, and have played your part with some talent, but don't imagine\r\nthat I am the dupe of all this pretty acting. Get up, child; don't make\r\na fool of yourself, but put on my crape cap for me, and then go as\r\nquickly as you can for a looking-glass.\"\r\n\r\n\"A looking-glass, your majesty?\" cried Charlotte in a frightened voice.\r\n\r\n\"A looking-glass,\" repeated the empress emphatically.\r\n\r\n\"I have none, your majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said Maria Theresa, her patience sorely tried by all this,\r\n\"let some one with better eyes than yours look for one. Go, Sophie, and\r\nbid one of the pages bring me a mirror from my old apartments below. I\r\ndo not suppose that there has been a general crashing of all the mirrors\r\nin the palace. In a quarter of an hour I shall be in my sitting-room. At\r\nthe end of that time the mirror must be there. Be quick, Sophie; and\r\nyou, Charlotte, finish the combing of my hair. There is but little to do\r\nto it now, so dry your tears.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" whispered Charlotte, \"I would there were more to do. I cannot help\r\ncrying, your majesty when I see the ruins of that beautiful hair.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet, poor child, you have spent so many weary hours over it,\"\r\nreplied the princess. \"You ought to be glad that your delicate little\r\nhands are no longer obliged to bear its weight--Charlotte,\" said she\r\nsuddenly, \"you have several times asked for your dismissal. Now, you\r\nshall have it, and you shall marry your lover, Counsellor Greiner. I\r\nmyself will give you away, and bestow the dowry.\"\r\n\r\nThe grateful girl pressed the hand of the empress to her lips, while she\r\nwhispered words of love and thanks.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa smiled, and took her seat, while Charlotte completed her\r\ntoilet. Match-making was the empress's great weakness, and she was in\r\nhigh spirits over the prospect of marrying Charlotte.\r\n\r\nThe simple mourning costume was soon donned, and the empress rose to\r\nleave her dressing-room. As she passed the empty frame of the Psyche,\r\nshe turned laughing toward her maid of honor.\r\n\r\n\"I give you this mirror, Charlotte,\" said she. \"If the glass is really\r\nbroken, it shall be replaced by the costliest one that Venice can\r\nproduce. It will be to you a souvenir of your successful debut as an\r\nactress on this day. You have really done admirably. But let me tell you\r\none thing, my child,\" continued Maria Theresa, taking Charlotte's hand\r\nin hers. \"Never be an actress with your husband; but let your heart be\r\nreflected in all your words and deeds, as yonder mirror will give back\r\nthe truthful picture of your face. Let all be clear and bright in your\r\nmarried intercourse; and see that no breath of deception ever cloud its\r\nsurface. Take this wedding-gift, and cherish it as a faithful monitor.\r\nTruth is a light that comes to us from Heaven; let us look steadily at\r\nit, for evil as well as for good. This is the hour of my trial--no great\r\none--but still a trial. Let me now look at truth, and learn to bear the\r\nrevelation it is about to make.\"\r\n\r\nShe opened the door, and entered her sitting-room. Her commands had been\r\nobeyed; the mirror was in its place. She advanced with resolute step,\r\nbut as she approached the glass her eyes were instinctively cast down,\r\nuntil she stood directly before it. The decisive moment had arrived; she\r\nwas to see--what?\r\n\r\nSlowly her eyes were raised, and she looked. She uttered a low cry, and\r\nstarted back in horror. She had seen a strange, scarred, empurpled face,\r\nwhose colorless lips and hard features had filled her soul with\r\nloathing.\r\n\r\nBut with all the strength of her brave and noble heart, Maria Theresa\r\novercame the shock, and looked again. She forced her eyes to contemplate\r\nthe fearful image that confronted her once beautiful face, and long and\r\nearnestly she gazed upon it.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said she at last, with a sigh, \"I must make acquaintance with\r\nthis caricature of my former self. I must accustom myself to the\r\nmortifying fact that this is Maria Theresa, or I might some of these\r\ndays call for a page to drive out that hideous old crone! I must learn,\r\ntoo, to be resigned, for it is the hand of my heavenly Father that has\r\ncovered my face with this grotesque mask. Since He has thought fit to\r\ndeprive me of my beauty, let His divine will be done.\"\r\n\r\nFor some moments she remained silent, still gazing intently at the\r\nmirror. Finally a smile overspread her entire countenance, and she\r\nnodded at the image in the glass.\r\n\r\n\"Well! you ugly old woman,\" said she aloud, \"we have begun our\r\nacquaintance. Let us be good friends. I do not intend to make one effort\r\nto lessen your ugliness by womanly art; I must seek to win its pardon\r\nfrom the world by noble deeds and a well-spent life. Perhaps, in future\r\ndays, when my subjects lament my homeliness, they may add that\r\nnevertheless I was a GOOD, and--well! in this hour of humiliation we may\r\npraise one another, I think--perchance a GREAT sovereign.\"\r\n\r\nHere the empress turned from the mirror and crossing over to the spot\r\nwhere the emperor's portrait hung, she continued her soliloquy. \"But\r\nFranz, dear Franz, you at least are spared the sight of your Theresa's\r\ntransformation. I could not have borne this as I do, if you had been\r\nhere to witness it. Now! what matters it? My people will not remind me\r\nof it, and my children have already promised to love me, and forgive my\r\ndeformity. Sleep, then, my beloved, until I rejoin you in heaven. There,\r\nthe mask will fall for me, as for poor Josepha, and there we shall be\r\nglorified and happy.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress then returned to the dressing-room, where her attendants,\r\nanxious and unhappy, awaited her reappearance. What was their\r\nastonishment to see her tranquil and smiling, not a trace of discontent\r\nupon her countenance!\r\n\r\n\"Let the steward of the household be apprised that I will have mirrors\r\nin all my apartments. They can be hung at once, and may be replaced by\r\nthose which the emperor has ordered, whenever they arrive from Venice.\r\nLet my page Gustavus repair to Cardinal Migazzi and inform him that\r\nto-morrow I make my public thanksgiving in the cathedral of St. Stephen.\r\nI shall go on foot and in the midst of my people, that they may see me\r\nand know that I am not ashamed of the judgments of God. Let Prince\r\nKaunitz be advised that on to-morrow, after the holy sacrifice, I will\r\nreceive him here. Open my doors and windows, and let us breathe the free\r\nair of heaven. I am no longer an invalid, my friends; I am strong, and\r\nready to begin life anew.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nTHE INTERVIEW WITH KAUNITZ.\r\n\r\nFrom earliest morning the streets of Vienna had been thronged by a\r\njoyous multitude, eagerly awaiting the sight of their restored\r\nsovereign. All Vienna had mourned when the empress lay ill; all Vienna\r\nnow rejoiced that she had recovered. Maria Theresa's road to the church\r\nwas one long triumph--the outpouring of the sincere love which filled\r\nthe hearts of her subjects. The empress had done nothing to court this\r\nhomage; for the notice given to the cardinal had been as short as it\r\npossibly could be; but the news of the thanksgiving had flown from one\r\nend of Vienna to the other; and every corporation and society, the\r\nstudents of every college, and every citizen that was at liberty to\r\nleave home, flocked to congratulate the well-beloved sovereign. The\r\nstreets through which she had to pass were lined with people bearing\r\nflags, banners, and emblems, while near them stood the children of the\r\neducational and orphan asylums, which had been endowed by the\r\nmunificence of the empress. Lofty and lowly, rich and poor, stood in\r\nfriendly contact with each other; even the nobles, imitating Maria\r\nTheresa's affability, mixed smiling and free among the people. All sense\r\nof rank and station seemed lost in the universal joy of the hour.\r\n\r\nThe bells chimed, and the people rent the air with shouts; for this was\r\nthe signal of the empress's sortie from the palace, and her people knew\r\nthat she was coming to meet them. At last they saw her; leaning on the\r\narm of the emperor, and followed by her other children, she came, proud\r\nand resolute as ever. It was a beautiful sight, this empress with her\r\nten lovely sons and daughters, all joyful and smiling, as like simple\r\nsubjects they walked through the streets toward the church, to thank God\r\nfor her recovery.\r\n\r\nInexpressible joy beamed from Maria Theresa's eyes--those superb eyes\r\nwhose light the small-pox could not quench. Her great and noble soul\r\nlooked out from their azure depths, and her head seemed encircled by a\r\nglory. In this hour she was no \"ugly old crone,\" she was the happy,\r\nproud, triumphant empress, who in the eyes of her people was both\r\nbeautiful and beloved. For the moment her widow's sorrows were\r\nforgotten; and when surrounded by so many loyal hearts, she sank on her\r\nknees before the altar of St. Stephen, she thanked God for the joy of\r\nthis hour, and made a vow that her whole life should be devoted to the\r\nwelfare of the people who on this day had given her so touching a\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\nExhausted not only by emotion, but by the heat of the July sun which\r\nshone on her head as she returned, the empress at last reached her own\r\nrooms. Her tire-women hastened to relieve her of her coverings and to\r\ndry her moistened hair and face. But she waved them back.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, my friends, let me refresh myself in my own way. The air is\r\nmore skilful than your hands, and is softer than your napkins. Open the\r\ndoors and the windows, and place my arm-chair in the middle of the\r\nroom.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, your majesty,\" remonstrated one of the maids of honor, \"you forget\r\nyour condition. The draught will do you injury.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know what such fastidious people mean by a draught,\" replied\r\nthe empress, laughing and taking her seat; \"but I know that the good God\r\nhas sent this air from heaven for man's enjoyment; and when I feel its\r\ncool kiss upon my cheek, I think that God is nigh. I have always loved\r\nto feel the breath of my Creator, and therefore it is that I have always\r\nbeen strong and healthy. See! see! how it blows away my mantle! You are\r\nright, sweet summer wind, I will throw the burden away.\"\r\n\r\nShe let fall her mantle, and gave her bare shoulders to the wind,\r\nenjoying the breeze, and frightening her maids of honor out of their\r\npropriety.\r\n\r\n\"Now, let me have some refreshment,\" cried she. Away sped two or three\r\nof the ladies, each one anxious to escape from the gust that was driving\r\nevery thing before it in the empress's rooms. A page brought in a tray,\r\nand there, in the centre of the room, the empress, although yet\r\noverheated, ate a plate of strawberries, and drank a glass of lemonade,\r\ncooled in ice. [Footnote: Caroline Pichler, \"Memoirs,\" vol i., pp.\r\n18,19.  Maria Theresa supported without pain extreme degrees of heat and\r\ncold. Summer and winter her windows stood open, and often the\r\nsnow-flakes have been seen to fall upon her escritoire while she wrote.\r\nIn winter, the Emperor Joseph always came into his mother's rooms\r\nwrapped in furs.]\r\n\r\nShe was interrupted, in the midst of all this comfort, by another page,\r\nwho announced Prince Kaunitz. Maria Theresa rose hastily from her seat.\r\n\"Shut all the doors and windows,\" exclaimed she, \"do not let him scent\r\nthe draught.\" [Footnote: Wraxall, vol. ii., p. 380.]\r\n\r\nWhile her orders were being obeyed, she looked around to convince\r\nherself that every avenue was closed through which the wind might\r\npenetrate, and that done, she ordered the door to be thrown open, and\r\nthe prince admitted.\r\n\r\nPrince Kaunitz approached with his usual serious and tranquil demeanor.\r\nHe bowed low, and said: \"I congratulate your majesty and the Austrian\r\nempire, upon your happy recovery. I, who have no fear of any other\r\nenemy, have trembled before this deadly foe of your imperial house. For\r\nall other dangers we have craft and valor; but against this one no\r\nbravery or statesmanship can avail.\"\r\n\r\n\"But skill has availed; and to Van Swieten, under Providence, I am\r\nindebted for my life,\" cried the empress, warmly. \"I know, Kaunitz, that\r\nyou have but little faith in heavenly or earthly physicians; and I pray\r\nGod that you may never acquire it through the bitter experience of such\r\nsuffering as I have but lately endured! Often during my sleepless nights\r\nI have longed for a sight of your grave face, and it grieved me to think\r\nthat perchance we might never meet again to talk of Austria, and plan\r\nfor Austria's welfare. \"\r\n\r\n\"But I knew that your majesty would recover,\" said Kaunitz, with unusual\r\nwarmth; \"I knew it, for Austria cannot spare you, and as long as there\r\nis work for you here below, your strong mind will bid defiance to\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa colored with pleasure. It was so seldom that Kaunitz gave\r\nutterance to such sentiments, that his praise was really worth having.\r\n\r\n\"You think, then, that Austria needs me?\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"I do, indeed, your majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if God had called me to Himself, what would you have done?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would still have labored, as in duty bound, for my country; but I\r\nwould have owed a lifelong grudge to Providence for its want of wisdom.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a scoffer, Kaunitz,\" said the empress. \"Your Creator is very\r\nmerciful to allow you time to utter the unchristian sentiments which are\r\nforever falling from your lips. But God sees the heart of man, and He\r\nknows that yours is better than your words. Since the loving,\r\nall-suffering Lord forgives you, so will I. But tell me, how has my\r\nempire fared during these six long weeks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, your majesty. Throughout the day I worked for myself, throughout\r\nthe night for you, and nothing is behindhand. Each day adds to our\r\ninternal strength, that gives us consideration abroad, and soon we shall\r\nhold our own as one of the four great European powers, mightier than in\r\nthe days when the sun never set upon Austrian realms. The empire of\r\nCharles V. was grand, but it was not solid. It resembled a reversed\r\npyramid, in danger of being crushed by its own weight. The pyramid\r\nto-day is less in size, but greater in base and therefore firmer in\r\nfoundation. [Footnote: \"Letters of a French Traveller,\" volt i., p.\r\n421.] Strength does not depend so much upon size as upon proportion: and\r\nAustria, although her territory has been vaster, has never been so truly\r\npowerful as she is in this, the reign of your majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"If Silesia were but ours again! As for Naples and Alsatia, they were\r\nnever more than disjecta membra of our empire; and they were always less\r\nprofit than trouble. But Silesia is ours--ours by a common ancestry, a\r\ncommon language, and the strong tie of affection. I shall never recover\r\nfront the blow that I received when I lost Silesia.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall have restitution some of these days, your majesty,\" said\r\nKaunitz.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say that I shall ever recover Silesia?\" asked the\r\nempress, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"From the King of Prussia? No--never! He holds fast to his possessions,\r\nand his sharp sword would be unsheathed to-morrow, were we to lay the\r\nweight of a finger upon his right to Silesia. But we shall be otherwise\r\nrevenged, in the day when we shall feel that we have attained the\r\nnoontide of our power and strength.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not intend to propose to me a war of aggression!\" said the\r\nempress, shocked.\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty, but if we should see two eagles tearing to pieces a\r\nlamb which is beyond hope of rescue, our two-headed eagle must swoop\r\ndown upon the robbers, and demand his share of the booty. I foresee evil\r\ndoings among our neighbors. Catharine of Russia is bold and\r\nunscrupulous; Frederick of Prussia knows it, and he already seeks the\r\nfriendship of Russia, that he may gain an accomplice as well as an\r\nally.\"\r\n\r\n\"God forbid that I should follow in the wake of the King of Prussia!\"\r\ncried Maria Theresa. \"Never will I accept, much less seek an alliance\r\nwith this cruel woman; whose throne is blood-stained and whose heart is\r\ndead to every sentiment of womanly virtue and honor!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty need have no intercourse with the woman; you have only to\r\nconfer with the sovereign of a powerful neighboring empire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Russia is not a neighboring empire,\" exclaimed the empress. \"On one\r\noccasion I wrote to the Empress Elizabeth, 'I will always be your\r\nfriend, but with my consent you shall never be my neighbor.' [Footnote:\r\nHistorical.] Poland lies between Russia and Austria.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Kaunitz, with one of his meaning smiles, \"but how long will\r\nPoland divide us from Russia?\"\r\n\r\n\"Man!\" exclaimed Maria Theresa with horror, \"you do not surely insinuate\r\nthat we would dare to lay a hand upon Poland?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not we, but the Empress of Russia will--\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible! impossible! She dare not do it--\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz shrugged his shoulders. \"DARE, your majesty? Some things we dare\r\nnot attempt because they are difficult; others are difficult because we\r\ndare not attempt them. [Footnote: Kaunitz's own words. Hormayer,\r\n\"Plutarch,\" vol. xii., p. 271.] The Empress of Russia dares do any\r\nthing; for she knows how to take things easily, and believes in her own\r\nforesight. Despots are grasping, and Catharine is a great despot. We\r\nmust make haste to secure her good-will, that when the time comes we may\r\nall understand one another.\"\r\n\r\n\"I!\" exclaimed the empress, \"I should stoop so low as to seek the\r\ngood-will of this wicked empress, who mounted her throne upon the dead\r\nbody of her husband, while her lovers stood by, their hands reeking with\r\nthe blood of the murdered emperor! Oh, Kaunitz! you would never ask me\r\nto do this thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty is great enough to sacrifice your personal antipathies to\r\nthe good of your country. Your majesty once condescended to write to\r\nFarinelli and THAT act won us the friendship of the King of Spain and of\r\nhis sons; THAT letter will be the means of placing an Archduchess of\r\nAustria on the throne of Naples.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would have been,\" said Maria Theresa, heaving a sigh. \"The bride of the\r\nKing of Naples is no more! My poor Johanna! My beautiful child!\"\r\n\r\n\"But the Archduchess Josepha lives, and I had intended to propose to\r\nyour majesty to accept the hand of the King of Naples for her highness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the house of Naples then so desirous of our alliance that it has\r\nalready offered its heir to another one of my daughters? I am sorry that\r\nwe should be obliged to accept, for I have heard of late that the king\r\nis an illiterate and trifling fellow, scarcely better than the lazzaroni\r\nwho are his chosen associates. Josepha will not be happy with such a\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty, her highness does not marry the young ignoramus who, to\r\nbe sure, knows neither how to read nor write--she marries the King of\r\nNaples; and surely if any thing can gracefully conceal a man's faults,\r\nit is the purple mantle of royalty.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will give my child to this representative of royalty,\" said Maria\r\nTheresa sadly, \"but I look upon her as a victim of expediency. If she is\r\ntrue to her God and to her spouse, I must be content, even though, as a\r\nwoman, Josepha's life will be a blank.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this alliance,\" said Kaunitz, still pursuing the object for which\r\nhe was contending, \"this marriage is the result of one letter to\r\nFarinelli. Your majesty once condescended to write to La Pompadour. THAT\r\nletter won the friendship of France, and its fruits will be the marriage\r\nof the Archduchess Marie Antoinette, and her elevation to the throne of\r\nFrance. Your majesty sees then what important results have sprung from\r\ntwo friendly letters which my honored sovereign has not disdained to\r\nwrite. Surely when wise statesmanship prompts your majesty to indite a\r\nthird letter to the Empress of Russia, you will not refuse its counsels\r\nand suggestions. The two first letters were worth to us two thrones; the\r\nthird may chance to be worth a new province.\"\r\n\r\n\"A new province!\" exclaimed the empress, coming closer to Kaunitz, and\r\nin her eagerness laying her hand upon his shoulder. \"Tell me--what wise\r\nand wicked stratagem do you hatch within your brain to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"My plans, so please your majesty,\" said the prince, raising his eyes so\r\nas to meet those of the empress, \"my plans are not of to-day. They--\"\r\n\r\nBut suddenly he grew dumb, and gazed horror-stricken at the face of\r\nMaria Theresa. Kaunitz was short-sighted, and up to this moment be had\r\nremained in ignorance of the fearful change that had forever transformed\r\nthe empress's beauty into ugliness. The discovery had left him\r\nspeechless.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" cried the empress, not suspecting the cause of his sudden\r\nsilence. \"You have not the courage to confide your plans to me? They\r\nmust be dishonorable. If not, in the name of Heaven, speak!\"\r\n\r\nThe prince answered not a word. The shock had been too great; and as he\r\ngazed upon that scarred and blotched face, once so smooth, fair, and\r\nbeautiful, his presence of mind forsook him, and his diplomacy came to\r\nnaught.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me your majesty\" said he, as pale and staggering he retreated\r\ntoward the door. \"A sudden faintness has come over me, and every thing\r\nswims before my vision. Let me entreat your permission to retire.\"\r\n\r\nWithout awaiting the empress's reply, he made a hasty bow, and fled from\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nThe empress looked after him in utter astonishment. \"What has come over\r\nthe man?\" said she to herself. \"He looks as if he had seen a ghost!\r\nWell--I suppose it is nothing more than a fit of eccentricity.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she flung back her head with a half-disdainful smile. But as she did\r\nso, her eyes lit accidentally upon the mirror, and she saw her own image\r\nreflected in its bright depths.\r\n\r\nShe started; for she had already forgotten the \"ugly old woman\" whom she\r\nhad apostrophized on the day previous. Suddenly she burst into a peal of\r\nlaughter, and cried out. \"No wonder poor Kaunitz looked as if he had\r\nseen something horrible! HE SAW ME--and I am the Medusa that turned him\r\ninto stone. Poor, short-sighted man! He had been in blissful ignorance\r\nof my altered looks until I laid my hand upon his shoulder. I must do\r\nsomething to heal the wound I have inflicted. I owe him more than I can\r\nwell repay. I will give him a brilliant decoration, and that will be a\r\ncure-all; for Kaunitz is very vain and very fond of show.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the empress was writing the note which was to accompany her gift,\r\nKaunitz, with his handkerchief over his mouth, was dashing through the\r\npalace corridors to his carriage. With an impatient gesture he motioned\r\nto his coachman to drive home with all speed.\r\n\r\nNot with his usual stateliness, but panting, almost running, did Kaunitz\r\ntraverse the gilded halls of his own palace, which were open to-day in\r\nhonor of the empress's recovery, and were already festive with the sound\r\nof the guests assembling to a magnificent dinner which was to celebrate\r\nthe event. Without a word to the Countess Clary, who came forward\r\nelegantly attired for the occasion, Kaunitz flew to his study, and\r\nsinking into an arm-chair, he covered his face with his hands. He felt\r\nas if he had been face to face with death. That was not his beautiful,\r\nmajestic, superb Maria Theresa; it was a frightful vision--a messenger\r\nfrom the grave, that forced upon his unwilling mind the dreadful\r\nfuturity that awaits all who are born of woman.\r\n\r\n\"Could it be? Was this indeed the empress, whose beauty had intoxicated\r\nher subjects, as drawing from its sheath the sword of St. Stephen, she\r\nheld it flashing in the sun, and called upon them to defend her rights?\r\nOh, could it be that this woman, once beautiful as Olympian Juno, had\r\nbeen transformed into such a caricature?\"\r\n\r\nA thrill of pain darted through the whole frame of the prince, and he\r\ndid what since his mother's death he had never done--he wept.\r\n\r\nBut gradually he overcame his grief, the scanty fountain of his tears\r\ndried up, and he resumed his cold and habitual demeanor. For a long time\r\nhe sat motionless in his chair, staring at the wall that was opposite.\r\nFinally he moved toward his escritoire and took up a pen.\r\n\r\nHe began to write instructions for the use of his secretaries. They were\r\nnever to pronounce in his presence the two words DEATH and SMALL-POX. If\r\nthose words ever occurred in any correspondence or official paper that\r\nwas to come before his notice, they were to be erased. Those who\r\npresented themselves before the prince were to be warned that these\r\nfearful words must never pass their lips in his presence. A secretary\r\nwas to go at once to the Countess Clary, that she might prepare the\r\nguests of the prince, and caution them against the use of the offensive\r\nwords. [Footnote: Hormayer, \"Austrian Plutarch,\" vol. xii., p. 374.]\r\n\r\nWhen Kaunitz had completed these singular instructions, he rang, and\r\ngave the paper to a page. As he did so, a servant entered with a letter\r\nand a package from her majesty the empress.\r\n\r\nThe package contained the grand cross of the order of St Stephen but\r\ninstead of the usual symbol the cross was composed of costly brilliants.\r\nThe letter was in the empress's own hand--a worthy answer to the\r\n\"instructions\" which Kaunitz was in the act of sending to his\r\nsecretaries.\r\n\r\nThe empress wrote as follows: \"I send you the grand cross of St.\r\nStephen; but as a mark of distinction you must wear it in brilliants.\r\nYou have done so much to dignify it, that I seize with eagerness the\r\nopportunity which presents itself to offer you a tribute of that\r\ngratitude which I feel for your services, and shall continue to feel\r\nuntil the day of my death. MARIA THERESA.\" [Footnote: Wraxall, vol.\r\nii., p. 479.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nTHE ARCHDUCHESS JOSEPHA.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the empress and her prime minister approached their\r\nfulfilment; Austria was about to contract ties of kindred with her\r\npowerful neighbors.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa had again consented to receive the King of Naples as her\r\nson-in-law, and he was the affianced husband of the archduchess Josepha.\r\nThe palace of Lichtenstein, the residence of the Neapolitan ambassador\r\nwas, in consequence of the betrothal, the scene of splendid festivities,\r\nand in the imperial palace preparations were making for the approaching\r\nnuptials. They were to be solemnized on the fifteenth of October, and\r\nimmediately after the ceremony the young bride was to leave Vienna for\r\nNaples.\r\n\r\nEvery thing was gayety and bustle; all were deep in consultation over\r\ndress and jewels; and the great topic of court conversation was the\r\nparure of brilliants sent by the King of Spain, whose surpassing\r\nmagnificence had called forth an expresson of astonishment from the lips\r\nof the empress herself.\r\n\r\nThe trousseau of the archduchess was exposed in the apartments which had\r\nonce been occupied by the empress and her husband; and now Maria\r\nTheresa, followed by a bevy of wondering young archduchesses, was\r\nexamining her daughter's princely wardrobe, that with her own eyes she\r\nmight be sure that nothing was wanting to render it worthy of a\r\nqueen-elect. The young girls burst into exclamations of rapture when\r\nthey approached the table where, in its snowy purity, lay the bridal\r\ndress of white velvet, embroidered with pearls and diamonds.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" cried little Marie Antoinette, while she stroked it with her\r\npretty, rosy hand, \"oh, my beautiful Josepha, you will look like an\r\nangel, when you wear this lovely white dress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say rather, like a queen,\" returned Josepha, smiling. \"When a woman is\r\na queen, she is sure to look like an angel in the eyes of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does not follow, however, that because she is a queen, she shall be\r\nas happy as an angel,\" remarked the Archduchess Maria Amelia, who was\r\nbetrothed to the Duke of Parma.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, I would rather be the unhappy queen of an important\r\nkingdom than the happy wife of a poor little prince,\" replied Josepha,\r\nas, raising her superb diadem of brilliants, she advanced to a mirror\r\nand placed it upon her brow. \"Do you think,\" asked she proudly, \"that I\r\ncan be very miserable while I wear these starry gems upon my forehead?\r\nOh no! If it were set with thorns that drew my blood, I would rather\r\nwear this royal diadem than the light coronet of an insignificant\r\nduchess.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" exclaimed Amelia, \"would rather wear the ring of a beggar than\r\nbe the wife of a king who neither reads nor writes, and throughout all\r\nEurope is known by the name of a lazzarone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before whom millions of subjects must, nevertheless, bend the knee, and\r\nwho, despite of all, is a powerful and wealthy monarch,\" returned\r\nJosepha, angrily.\r\n\r\n\"That is, if his master, the Marquis Tannucci allows it,\" cried the\r\nArchduchess Caroline, laughing. \"For you know very well, Josepha, that\r\nTannucci is the king of your lazzaroni-king, and when he behaves amiss,\r\nputs him on his knees for punishment. Now when you are his wife, you can\r\ngo and comfort him in disgrace, and kneel down in the corner by his\r\nside. How interesting it will be!\"\r\n\r\nUpon this the Archduchess Amelia began to laugh, while her sisters\r\njoined in--all except Marie Antoinette, who with an expression of\r\nsympathy, turned to Josepha.\r\n\r\n\"Do not mind them, my Josepha,\" said she; \"if your king can not read,\r\nyou can teach him, and he will love you all the better; and in spite of\r\nevery thing, you will be a happy queen in the end.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not mind them, Antoinette,\" returned Josepha, her eyes flashing\r\nwith anger, \"for I well know that they are envious of my prosperity, and\r\nwould willingly supplant me. But my day of retaliation will come. It\r\nwill be that on which my sisters shall be forced to acknowledge the rank\r\nof the Queen of Naples, and to yield her precedence!\"\r\n\r\nA burst of indignation would have been the reply to these haughty words,\r\nhad the Archduchess Caroline not felt a hand upon her shoulder, and\r\nheard a voice which commanded silence.\r\n\r\nThe empress, who, at the beginning of this spicy dialogue, had been\r\nabsent on her survey in a neighboring apartment, had returned, and had\r\nheard Josepha's last words. Shocked and grieved, she came forward, and\r\nstood in the midst of her daughters.\r\n\r\n\"Peace!\" exclaimed the imperial mother. \"I have heard such words of\r\narrogance fall from your lips as must be expiated by humble petition to\r\nyour Creator. Sinful creatures are we all, whether we be princesses or\r\npeasants; and if we dare to lift our poor heads in pride of birth or\r\nstation, God will surely punish us. With a breath He overturns the\r\nsceptres of kings--with a breath He hurls our crowns to earth, until,\r\ncowering at His feet, we acknowledge our unworthiness. It becomes a\r\nqueen to remember that she is a mortal, powerless without the grace of\r\nGod to do one good action, and wearing under the purple of royalty the\r\ntattered raiment of humanity. But it is these absurd vanities that have\r\nstirred up the demon of pride in your hearts,\" continued the empress,\r\ngiving a disdainful toss to the velvet wedding-dress; \"let us leave\r\nthese wretched gew-gaws and betake ourselves to the purer air of our own\r\nrooms.\"\r\n\r\nShe waved her hand, and motioning to her daughters, they followed her,\r\nsilent and ashamed. All had their eyes cast down, and none saw the tears\r\nthat now fell like rain from Josepha's eyes. She was thoroughly\r\nmortified and longed to escape to her room; but as she bent her head to\r\ntake leave of the empress, the latter motioned her to remain.\r\n\r\n\"I have as yet a few words to speak with you, my daughter,\" said Maria\r\nTheresa, as she closed the door of her dressing-room. \"Your haughty\r\nconduct of this day has reminded me that you have a sacred duty to\r\nperform. The vanities of the world will have less weight with you when\r\nyou return from the graves of your ancestors. Go to the imperial vault,\r\nand learn from the ashes of the emperors and empresses who sleep there,\r\nthe nothingness of all worldly splendor. Kneel down beside your dear\r\nfather's tomb, and pray for humility. Tell him to pray for me, Josepha,\r\nfor my crown weighs heavily upon my brow, and I fain would be at rest.\"\r\n\r\nJosepha made no answer. She stared at her mother with an expression of\r\nhorror and incredulity, as though she meant to ask if she had heard her\r\nwords aright.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my daughter!\" cried Maria Theresa, surprised at Josepha's\r\nsilence. \"Why do you linger? Go--go, child, and recalling the sins of\r\nyour life, beg pardon of God, and the blessing of your deceased father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me that blessing yourself, dear mother,\" faltered the princess,\r\nclasping her hands, and looking imploringly at the empress. \"My father's\r\nspirit is here, it is not in that fearful vault.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress started. \"I cannot believe,\" said she, with severity, \"that\r\nmy daughter has cause to tremble before the ashes of her father. The\r\nguilty alone fear death; innocence is never afraid!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh mother, mother! I have no sin upon my soul, and yet I--\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" echoed the empress as Josepha paused.\r\n\r\n\"And yet I shiver at the very thought of going thither,\" said the\r\narchduchess. \"Yes your majesty, I shiver at the thought of encountering\r\nthe black coffins and mouldering skeletons of my forefathers. Oh,\r\nmother, have pity on my youth and cowardice! Do not force me to that\r\nhorrid place!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no right to exempt you from the performance of this sacred duty,\r\nJosepha,\" replied the empress firmly. \"It is a time-honored custom of\r\nour family, that the princesses of Austria, who marry kings, should take\r\nleave of the graves of their ancestors. I cannot release the Queen of\r\nNaples from her duty. She is to wear the crown, she must bear the\r\ncross.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I dread it! I dread it so!\" murmured Josepha. \"I shudder at the\r\nthought of Josepha's corpse. I never loved her, and she died without\r\nforgiving me. Oh, do not force me to go alone in the presence of the\r\ndead!\"\r\n\r\n\"I command you to go into the vault where repose the holy ashes of your\r\nfathers,\" repeated the empress sternly. \"Bend your lofty head, my\r\ndaughter, and throw yourself with humility upon the graves of your\r\nancestors, there to learn the vanity of all human greatness and human\r\npower.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercy, mercy!\" cried the terrified girl. \"I cannot, I cannot obey your\r\ndreadful behest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who dares say 'I cannot,' when duty is in question?\" exclaimed the\r\nempress. \"You are my daughter and my subject still, and I will see\r\nwhether you intend to defy my authority.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, she rose and rang her little golden bell. \"The carriage of\r\nthe Archduchess Josepha,\" said she to the page who answered the summons.\r\n\"Let a courier be dispatched to the Capuchin fathers to inform them that\r\nin a quarter of an hour the princess will visit the imperial vault. Now,\r\nprincess,\" continued the empress as the page left the room, \"you will\r\nnot surely have the hardihood to say again, 'I cannot?'\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" faltered Josepha, \"I will obey. But one thing I must ask. Does\r\nyour majesty wish to kill me?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, child?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean that I will die, if you force me to this vault,\" replied\r\nJosepha, pale as death. \"I feel it in the icy chill that seizes my heart\r\neven now. I tell you, mother, that I will die, if you send me to the\r\nfearful place where Josepha's corpse infects the air with its\r\ndeath-mould. Do you still desire that I shall go?\"\r\n\r\n\"You need not seek to frighten me, Josepha; stratagem will avail you\r\nnothing,\" replied the empress, coldly. \"It is not given to mortals to\r\nknow the hour of their death, and I cannot allow myself to be influenced\r\nby such folly. Go, my child, there is nothing to fear; the spirits of\r\nyour forefathers will shield you from harm,\" added she kindly.\r\n\r\n\"I go,\" replied Josepha; \"but my mother has sentenced me to death.\"\r\n\r\nShe bent her head and left the room. The empress looked after her\r\ndaughter as she went, and a sudden pang shot through her heart. She felt\r\nas though she could not let her go--she felt as if she must call her\r\nback, and pressing her to her heart, release her from the ordeal which\r\ntried her young soul so fearfully.\r\n\r\nJust then the princess, who had reached the door, turned her large dark\r\neyes with another look of entreaty. This was enough to restore the\r\nempress to her self-possession.\r\n\r\nShe would not call her back. She saw rather than heard the trembling\r\nlips that strove to form a last appeal for mercy, and the graceful\r\nfigure vanished.\r\n\r\nWhen she was out of sight, all the tenderness, all the anxiety of the\r\nempress returned. She rushed forward, then suddenly stood still and\r\nshaking her head, she murmured, \"No! no! It would be unpardonable\r\nweakness. I cannot yield. She must go to the grave of her fathers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nTHE DEPARTURE.\r\n\r\nThe messenger had returned, the carriage waited, and Josepha had no\r\nlonger a pretext for delaying her visit to the vault. She must obey her\r\nmother's behest--she must perform the horrible pilgrimage! Pale and\r\nspeechless she suffered her attendants to throw her mantle around her,\r\nand then, as if in obedience to some invisible phantom that beckoned her\r\non, she rose from her seat and advanced rigidly to the door. Suddenly\r\nshe paused, and, turning to her maid of honor, she said, \"Be so kind as\r\nto call my sister Antoinette, I must bid her farewell.\"\r\n\r\nA few moments elapsed, when the door opened and the Archduchess Marie\r\nAntoinette flew into her sister's arms. Josepha pressed her closely to\r\nher heart.\r\n\r\n\"I could not go, my darling\" whispered she, \"without once more seeing\r\nyou. Let me look, for the last time, upon that sweet face, and those\r\nbright eyes that are lit up with the blue of heaven. Kiss me, dear, and\r\npromise not to forget me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can never forget, never cease to love you, sister,\" replied the\r\nchild, returning Josepha's caresses. \"But why do you say farewell? Why\r\nare you crying? Are you going to leave us already for that young king\r\nwho is to take you away from us? Oh, Josepha, how can you love a man\r\nwhom you have never seen?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not love the King of Naples, dear child,\" said Josepha, sadly.\r\n\"Oh, Antoinette! would you could understand my sorrows!\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak, dear sister,\" replied Antoinette, tenderly. \"Am I not twelve\r\nyears old, and does not the Countess Lerchenfeld tell me, every time I\r\ndo wrong, that I am no longer a child? Tell me, then, what grieves you?\r\nI will keep your secret, I promise you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I weep,\" said Josepha, \"because it is so sad to die before one has\r\nknown the happiness of living.\"\r\n\r\n\"Die!\" exclaimed Antoinette, turning pale. \"Why do you speak of dying,\r\nyou who are about to become a queen?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall never live to be a queen, my sister. The empress has commanded\r\nme to visit the imperial vault. I go thither to-day; in a few days I\r\nshall be carried thither, never to return. [Footnote: The princess's own\r\nwords. See \"Memoires sur la Vie Privee de Marie Antoinette,\" par Madame\r\nCampan, vol i., p. 38.] Farewell, Antoinette; I leave you to-day, but\r\nI leave you for the grave.\"\r\n\r\n\"'No, no, no!\" screamed the child. \"You shall not go. I will throw\r\nmyself at the feet of the empress, and never rise until she has released\r\nyou, dear sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you yet to learn that the empress never retracts her words? It is\r\nuseless. I trust go, and my death-warrant is signed.\"\r\n\r\n\"It shall not be!\" cried Antoinette, beside herself with grief. \"Wait\r\ndear, Josepha, until I return. I go to obtain your release.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can you say to the empress, my poor little one?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will beg for mercy, and if she will not listen, I shall rise and tell\r\nher fearlessly, 'Your majesty, Josepha says that you have sentenced her\r\nto death. No mortal has power over the life of an imperial princess; God\r\nalone has that power. My sister must not go into the vault, for if she\r\ndoes, she dies, and that by your hand.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd as the child spoke these words, she threw back her head, and her\r\neyes darted fire. She looked like her mother.\r\n\r\n\"I see, Antoinette,\" said Josepha, with a smile, \"that you would not\r\nsubmit tamely to death. You have a brave soul, my little sister, and\r\nwill know how to straggle against misfortune. But I--I have no spirit, I\r\ncan only suffer and obey; and before I die, I must open my heart to\r\nyou--you shall receive my last thoughts.\"\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette looked with tearful eyes at her sister, and sank, white\r\nas a lily, on her knees.\r\n\r\n\"I am ready,\" said she, folding her hands, while Josepha bent forward,\r\nand laid her hand, as with a blessing, upon Antoinette's soft blond\r\nhair.\r\n\r\n\"When I am dead,\" said Josepha, \"go to my sisters, and beg them to\r\nforgive my unkind words. Tell them that I loved them all dearly. Say to\r\nMaria Amelia that she must pardon my unsisterly conduct. It arose, not\r\nfrom haughtiness, but from despair. For, Antoinette, I hated the King of\r\nNaples, and well I knew what a miserable fate awaited me as his queen.\r\nBut there was no rescue for me, that I knew; so I tried to hide my grief\r\nunder the semblance of exultation. Tell her to forgive me for the sake\r\nof the tears I have shed in secret over this hated betrothal. How often\r\nhave I called upon death to liberate me! and yet, now that the dark\r\nshadow of Azrael's icy wing is upon me, I fear to die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me die for you, sister!\" exclaimed Antoinette, resolutely. \"Give me\r\nthe hood and mantle. I will cover my face, and no one will know that it\r\nis I, for I am almost as tall as you. If I never return from the vault\r\nalive, the empress will pardon you for my sake. Oh, I should die happy,\r\nif my death would rescue you, Josepha.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Antoinette attempted to draw off her sister's mantle, and put it\r\naround her own shoulders. But Josepha withheld her.\r\n\r\n\"Dear child,\" said she, kissing her, \"is it possible that you are\r\nwilling to die for me, you who are so young and happy?\"\r\n\r\n\"For that very reason, Josepha,\" said Antoinette, \"it might be well to\r\ndie. Who knows what sorrows the world may have in reserve for me? Let me\r\ndie to-day, dear sister, let me--\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment the door opened, and the maid of honor of the Archduchess\r\nJosepha appeared.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your highness,\" said she deprecatingly. \"A page of her\r\nmajesty is here to know if you have gone to the imperial vaults.\"\r\n\r\n\"Apprise her majesty that I am about to leave,\" replied Josepha, with\r\ndignity. Taking Antoinette in her arms, she said, in a whisper: \"You\r\nsee, it is I who must die. Farewell, dearest; may you live and be\r\nhappy!\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, she tore herself away from the weeping child and hastened to\r\nher carriage. Antoinette, with a shriek, rushed forward to follow, but\r\nJosepha had fastened the door. The poor child sank on her knees and\r\nbegan to pray. But prayer brought no consolation. She thought of her\r\nsister dying from terror, and wrung her hands while she cried aloud.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she ceased, started to her feet, and the blood mounted to her\r\npale face.\r\n\r\n\"The secret door!\" exclaimed she. \"I had forgotten it.\" She crossed the\r\nroom toward a picture that hung on a wall opposite, and touching a\r\nspring in its frame, it flew back and revealed a communication with one\r\nof the state-apartments. She sprang through the opening, her golden hair\r\nflying out in showers behind her, her cheeks glowing, her eyes flashing,\r\nand her heart beating wildly as she sped through the palace to the\r\nempress's apartments. The sentry would have stopped her; but throwing\r\nhim off with an imperious gesture, she darted through the door, and all\r\nceremony forgetting, flew to the sitting-room of the empress, and threw\r\nherself at her mother's feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nINOCULATION.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa was standing in the embrasure of a window, and she\r\nscarcely turned her head as she heard the rustling behind her. She took\r\nno notice of the breach of etiquette of which Antoinette was guilty, in\r\nrushing unannounced upon her solitude. Her eyes were fixed upon the\r\nchapel of the Capuchins in whose vaults lay so many whom she had loved.\r\nHer heart and thoughts were within those gray walls, now with her\r\nhusband and her dead children, now with Josepha, for whom she felt pang\r\nafter pang of anxiety. In an absent tone she turned and said:\r\n\r\n\"What brings you hither, little Antoinette?\"\r\n\r\n\"Josepha, dear mother. Have pity on Josepha!\"\r\n\r\nThe empress, with a thrill of joy at her heart, replied, \"She did not\r\ngo, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, she went because you forced her to go, but she went with a\r\nbroken heart. Oh, mamma, Josepha says that the dead are waiting to take\r\nher with them! May I not order my carriage and fly to bring her back?\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa said nothing. Her eyes turned first upon the beautiful\r\nlittle suppliant at her feet, then they wandered out through the evening\r\nhaze, and rested on the dark towers of the Capuchin chapel.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear mamma,\" continued Antoinette, \"if I may not bring her back, at\r\nleast let me share her danger. Be good to your poor little Antoinette.\r\nYou promised, if I behaved well, to do something for me, mamma, and now\r\nI deserve a reward, for Count Brandeis says that I have been a good girl\r\nof late. Do not shake your head, it would make me better if I went to\r\npray with Josepha. You do not know how vain and worldly I am. When I saw\r\nJosepha's beautiful jewels I was quite envious of her; and indeed,\r\nmamma, no one needs solitude and prayer more than I. Let me go and pray\r\nfor grace by the grave of my father.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress laid her hand upon her daughter's head, and looked at her\r\nbeautiful countenance with an expression of deepest tenderness.\r\n\r\n\"You are a noble-hearted child, my Antoinette,\" said she. \"With such\r\nsensibility as yours, you are likely to suffer from the faults and\r\nmisconceptions of the world; for magnanimity is so rare that it is often\r\nmisunderstood. You would share your sister's danger, while believing in\r\nits reality. No, no, darling, I cannot accept your generous sacrifice.\r\nIt would be useless, for Josepha's terror will shorten her prayers.\r\nBefore you could reach the chapel, she will have left it--\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa paused, and again looked out from the window. The rolling\r\nof carriage-wheels was distinctly heard coming toward the palace. Now it\r\nceased, and the sentry's voice was heard at the gates.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" cried the empress, joyfully, \"I was right. It is Josepha. Her\r\ndevotions have not been long; but I will confess to you, Antoinette,\r\nthat a weight is lifted from my heart. I have not breathed freely since\r\nshe left my presence. Oh, I will forgive her for her short prayers, for\r\nthey have shortened my miserable suspense!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me go and bring her to you, mamma.\" cried Antoinette, clapping her\r\nhands and darting toward the door. But the empress held her back.\r\n\r\n\"No, dear, remain with me. Josepha's heart will reveal to her that her\r\nmother longs to welcome her back.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment a page announced the Countess Lerchenfeld.\r\n\r\n\"It is not my child!\" cried the empress, turning pale.\r\n\r\nThe countess, too, was very pale, and she trembled as she approached the\r\nimperial mother.\r\n\r\n\"She is dead!\" murmured Marie Antoinette, sinking almost fainting to the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nBut the empress called out, \"Where is my child! In mercy, tell me why\r\nyou are here without her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please your majesty,\" replied the countess, \"I come to beg that you\r\nwill excuse her highness. She has been suddenly taken sick. She was\r\nlifted insensible to the carriage, and has not yet recovered her\r\nconsciousness.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa reeled, and a deathly paleness overspread her countenance.\r\n\"Sick!\" murmured she, with quivering lip. \"What--what happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know, your majesty. Accordng to your imperial command I\r\naccompanied her highness to the chapel. I went as far as the stairway\r\nthat leads to the crypts. Her highness was strangely agitated. I tried\r\nto soothe her, but as she looked below, and saw the open door, she\r\nshuddered, and clinging to me, whispered: 'Countess, I scent the\r\nloathesome corpse that even now stirs in its coffin at my approach.'\r\nAgain I strove to comfort her, but all in vain. Scarcely able to support\r\nherself, she bade me farewell, and commended herself to your majesty.\r\nThen, clinging to the damp walls, she tottered below, and disappeared.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did you not hold her back!\" cried Marie Antoinette. \"You had the\r\ncruelty to leave her--\"\r\n\r\n\"Peace, Antoinette,\" said the empress, raising her hand, imploringly.\r\n\"What else?\" asked she, hoarsely.\r\n\r\n\"I stood at the head of the stairway, your majesty, awaiting her\r\nhighness's return. For a while all was silent; then I heard a piercing\r\nshriek and I hastened to the vault--\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it my child?\" asked the empress, now as rigid as a marble statue.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty. I found her highness kneeling, with her head resting\r\nupon the tomb of the emperor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Insensible?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty. I approached and found her icy cold, her eyes\r\ndilated, and her face covered with drops of cold sweat. She was scarcely\r\nable to speak, but in broken accents she related to me that, as she was\r\nmaking her way toward the altar at the head of the emperor's tomb, she\r\nsuddenly became sensible that something was holding her back.\r\nHorror-stricken, she strove to fly, but could not. When, as she turned\r\nher head, she beheld the coffin of the Empress Josepha, and saw that\r\nfrom thence came the power that held her back. With a shriek she bounded\r\nforward, and fell at the foot of the emperor's tomb. I supported her\r\nuntil we reached the chapel--door, when she fainted, and I had to call\r\nfor help to bear her to her carriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now?\" asked the empress, who was weeping bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"She is still unconscious, your majesty. Herr van Swieten and the\r\nemperor are at her bedside.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" cried the unhappy empress, \"I, too, must be with my poor,\r\nmartyred child.\"\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette would have followed, but her mother bade her remain,\r\nand hastening from the room, Maria Theresa ran breathless through the\r\ncorridors until she reached her daughter's apartments.\r\n\r\nThere, like a crushed lily, lay the fair bride of Naples, while near her\r\nstood her brother in speechless grief. At the foot of the bed Van\r\nSwieten and one of the maids of honor were rubbing her white feet with\r\nstimulants.\r\n\r\nThe empress laid her hand upon Josepha's cold brow, and turning to Van\r\nSwieten, as though in his hands lay the fate of her child, as she asked:\r\n\r\n\"Will she die?\"\r\n\r\n\"Life and death,\" replied the physician, \"are in the hands of the Lord.\r\nAs long as there is life, there is hope.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa, shook her head. \"I have no hope,\" said she, with the\r\ncalmness of despair. \"'Tis the enemy of our house. Is it not, Van\r\nSwieten? Has she not the small-pox?\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear so, your majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"She must die, then--and it is I who have murdered her!\" shrieked the\r\nempress, wildly; and she fell fainting to the floor.\r\n\r\nOn the fifteenth of October, the day on which Josepha was to have given\r\nher hand to the King of Naples, the bells of Vienna tolled her funeral\r\nknell.\r\n\r\nNot in her gilded carriage rode the fair young bride, but cold and\r\nlifeless she lay under the black and silver pall on which were placed a\r\nmyrtle-wreath and a royal crown of gold.\r\n\r\nAnother Spouse had claimed her hand, and the marriage-rites were\r\nsolemnized in the still vaults of the chapel of the Capuchins.\r\n\r\nThe empress had not left her daughter's room since the fatal day of her\r\nreturn from the chapel. With all the tenderness of her affectionate\r\nnature she had been the nurse of her suffering child. Not a tear was in\r\nher eye, nor a murmur on her lips. Silent, vigilant, and sleepless, she\r\nhad struggled with the foe that was wresting yet another loved one from\r\nher house.\r\n\r\nDay by day Josepha grew worse until she lay dying. Still the empress\r\nshed no tear. Bending over her daughter's bed, she received her last\r\nsigh. And now she watched the corpse, and would not be moved, though the\r\nemperor and Van Swieten implored her to seek rest.\r\n\r\nWhen the body was removed, the poor, tearless mourner followed it from\r\nthe room through the halls and gates of the palace until it was laid in\r\nthe grave.\r\n\r\nThen she returned home, and, without a word, retired to her own\r\napartments. There, on a table, lay heaps of papers and letters with\r\nunbroken seals. But the empress heeded nothing of all this. Maternity\r\nreigned supreme in her heart--there was room in it for grief and remorse\r\nalone. She strode to the window, and there, as she had done not many\r\ndays before, she looked out upon the gray towers of the chapel, and\r\nthought how she had driven her own precious child into the dismal depths\r\nof its loathsome vaults.\r\n\r\nThe door was softly opened, and the emperor and Van Swieten were seen\r\nwith anxious looks directed toward the window where the empress was\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\n\"What is to be done?\" said Joseph. \"How is she to be awakened from that\r\nfearful torpor?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must bring about some crisis,\" replied Van Swieten, thoughtfully.\r\n\"We must awake both the empress and the mother. The one must have\r\nwork--the other, tears. This frozen sea of grief must thaw, or her\r\nmajesty will die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctor,\" cried Joseph, \"save her, I implore you. Do something to\r\nhumanize this marble grief.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will try, your majesty. With your permission I will assemble the\r\nimperial family here, and we will ask to be admitted to the presence of\r\nthe empress. The Archduchess Marie Antoinette and the Archduke\r\nMaximilian I shall not summon.\"\r\n\r\nNot long after, the door was once more softly opened, and the Emperor\r\nJoseph, followed by his sisters and the doctor, entered the empress's\r\nsitting-room.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa was still erect before the window, staring at the dark\r\ntowers of the chapel.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty,\" said Joseph, approaching, \"your children are here to\r\nmourn with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is well,\" replied Maria Theresa, without stirring from her position.\r\n\"I thank you all. But leave me, my children. I would mourn alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"But before we go, will not your majesty vouchsafe one look of\r\nkindness?\" entreated the emperor. \"May we not kiss your hand? Oh, my\r\nbeloved mother, your living children, too, have a right to your love! Do\r\nnot turn away so coldly from us. Let your children comfort their sad\r\nhearts with the sight of your dear and honored countenance.\"\r\n\r\nThere was so much genuine feeling in Joseph's voice, as he uttered these\r\nwords, that his mother could not resist him. She turned and gave him her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, my son,\" said she, \"for your loving words. They fall\r\nlike balsam upon my sore and wounded heart. God bless you all, my\r\nchildren, who have come hither to comfort your poor, sorrowing mother.\"\r\n\r\nThe archduchesses flocked, weeping to her side, and smiled through their\r\ntears, as they met her glance of love. But suddenly she started, and\r\nlooked searchingly around the room.\r\n\r\n\"Where are my little ones?\" said she anxiously.\r\n\r\nNo one spoke, but the group all turned their eyes upon Van Swieten,\r\nwhose presence, until now, had been unobserved by the empress.\r\n\r\nLike an angry lioness, she sprang forward to the threshold, and laid her\r\nhand upon Van Swieten's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"What means your presence here, Van Swieten?\" cried she loudly. \"What\r\nfearful message do you bear me now? My children my children! where are\r\nthey?\"\r\n\r\n\"In their rooms, your majesty,\" replied Van Swieten, seriously. \"I came\r\nhither expressly to apologize for their absence. It was I who prevented\r\nthem from coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so?\" exclaimed the empress.\r\n\r\n\"Because, your majesty, they have never had the small-pox; and contact\r\nwith you would be dangerous for them. For some weeks they must absent\r\nthemselves from your majesty's presence.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not telling me the truth, Van Swieten!\" cried Maria Theresa,\r\nhastily. \"My children are sick, and I must go to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty may banish me forever from the palace,\" said he, \"but as\r\nlong as I remain, you cannot approach your children. It is my duty to\r\nshield them from the infection which still clings to your majesty's\r\nperson. Would you be the probable cause of their death?\"\r\n\r\nThe earnest tone with which Van Swieten put this question so overcame\r\nthe empress, that she raised both her arms, and cried out in a voice of\r\npiercing anguish: \"Ah! it is I who caused Josepha's death!--I who\r\nmurdered my unhappy child!\"\r\n\r\nThese words once uttered, the icy bonds that had frozen her heart gave\r\nway, and Maria Theresa wept.\r\n\r\n\"She is saved!\" whispered Van Swieten to the emperor. \"Will your majesty\r\nnow request the archduchesses to retire? The empress does not like to be\r\nseen in tears; and this paroxysm once over, the presence of her\r\ndaughters will embarrass her.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor communicated Van Swieten's wish, and the princesses silently\r\nand noiselessly withdrew. The empress was on her knees, while showers of\r\nhealing tears were refreshing her seethed heart.\r\n\r\n\"Let us try to induce her to rise,\" whispered Van Swieten. \"This hour,\r\nif it please God, may prove a signal blessing to all Austria.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor approached, and tenderly strove to lift his mother, while he\r\nlavished words of love and comfort upon her. She allowed him to lead\r\ntier to a divan, where gradually the tempest of her grief gave place to\r\ndeep-drawn sighs, and, finally, to peace. The crisis, however, was long\r\nand terrible, for the affections of Maria Theresa were as strong as her\r\nwill; and fierce had been the conflict between the two.\r\n\r\nFor some time a deep silence reigned throughout the room. Finally, the\r\nempress raised her eyes and said, \"You will speak the truth, both of\r\nyou, will you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"We will, your majesty,\" replied the emperor and Van Swieten.\r\n\r\n\"Then, Joseph, say--are my children well and safe?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are, my dearest mother, and but for the doctor's prohibition, both\r\nwould have accompanied us thither.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa then turned to the physician. \"Van Swieten,\" said she,\r\n\"you, too, must swear to speak the truth. I have something to ask of you\r\nalso.\"\r\n\r\n\"I swear, your majesty,\" replied Van Swieten.\r\n\r\n\"Then say if I am the cause of my daughter's death. Do not answer me at\r\nonce. Take time for reflection, and, as Almighty God hears us, answer me\r\nconscientiously.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Nothing was heard save the heavy breathing of the\r\nempress, and the ticking of the golden clock that stood upon the mantel.\r\nMaria Theresa sat with her head bowed down upon her hands; before her\r\nstood Joseph, his pale and noble face turned toward the physician, and\r\nhis eyes fixed upon him with an expression of deepest entreaty. Van\r\nSwieten saw the look and answered it by a scarcely perceptible motion of\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n\"Now, speak, Van Swieten,\" said the empress, raising her head, and\r\nlooking him full in the face.\" Was Josepha's visit to the chapel-vault\r\nthe cause of her death?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty,\" said the physician gravely. \"In THIS SENSE you\r\nwere not guilty of her highness's death; for the body, in smallpox, is\r\ninfected long before it shows itself on the surface. Had her highness\r\nreceived the infection in the crypts of the chapel, she would be still\r\nliving. Her terror and presentiment of death were merely symptoms of the\r\ndisease.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress reached out both her hands to Van Swieten, and said: \"Thank\r\nyou, my friend. You surely would not deceive me with false comfort; I\r\ncan, therefore, even in the face of this great sorrow, find courage to\r\nlive and do my duty. I may weep for my lost child, but while weeping I\r\nmay feel that Heaven's will, and not my guilt, compassed her death.\r\nThank you, my dear son, for your sympathy and tenderness. You will never\r\nknow what comfort your love has been to me this day.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, she drew the emperor close to her, and putting both her arms\r\naround his neck, kissed him tenderly.\r\n\r\n\"Van Swieten,\" said she, then, \"what do you mean by saying that 'in this\r\nsense' I was not guilty of Josepha's death.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think, your majesty,\" replied the emperor, \"that I can explain those\r\nwords. He means to say that had you yielded to his frequent petitions to\r\nmake use of inoculation as a safeguard against the violence of the\r\nsmall-pox, our dear Josepha might have survived her attack. Is it not\r\nso, Van Swieten?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, your Majesty. If the empress would consent to allow the\r\nintroduction in Austria of inoculation for the small-pox, she would not\r\nonly shield her own family from danger, but would confer a great\r\nblessing on her subjects.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, Van Swieten,\" replied the empress, after a pause, \"what you\r\npropose seems sinful to me. Besides, I have heard that many who were\r\ninoculated for small-pox have died of its effects. But for this, they\r\nmight have lived for many years. How can I reconcile it to my conscience\r\nto assume such an awful responsibility?\" \"But,\" urged Van Swieten,\r\n\"thousands have been rescued, where two or three have perished. I do not\r\nsay that the remedy is infallible; but I can safely say that out of one\r\nhundred cases, ninety, by its use, are rendered innoxious. Oh, your\r\nmajesty! when you remember that within ten years five members of your\r\nfamily have been victims to this terrific scourge--when you remember how\r\nfor weeks Austria was in extremest sorrow while your majesty lay so ill,\r\nhow can you refuse such a boon for yourself and your people?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is hard for me to refuse any thing to the one whose skilful hand\r\nrestored me to life,\" replied the empress, while she reached her hand to\r\nVan Swieten.\r\n\r\n\"My dear, dear mother!\" exclaimed Joseph, \"do not refuse him! He asks\r\nyou to save the lives of thousands. Think how different life would have\r\nbeen for me had my Isabella lived! Think of my sister;--think of\r\nAntoinette and Maximilian, who long to be with you and cannot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctor,\" said the empress, \"if my children were inoculated, how long\r\nwould it be before I could see them?\"\r\n\r\n\"In two hours, your majesty; for in that time the poison would have\r\npermeated their systems.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the empress had resumed her habit of walking to and fro\r\nwhen she was debating any thing in her mind. She went on for some time,\r\nwhile Van Swieten and the emperor followed her movements with anxious\r\nlooks.\r\n\r\nFinally sire spoke. \"Well, my son,\" said she, coming close to Joseph,\r\nand smiling fondly upon him, \"I yield to you as co-regent of Austria.\r\nYou, too, have some right to speak in this matter, and your wishes shall\r\ndecide mine. To you, also, Van Swieten, I yield in gratitude for all\r\nthat you have done for me and mine. Let Austria profit by this new\r\ndiscovery, and may it prove a blessing to us all! Are you satisfied,\r\nJoseph?\"\r\n\r\n\"More than satisfied,\" exclaimed he, kissing his mother's hand.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Van Swieten,\" continued Maria Theresa, \"hasten to inoculate my\r\nchildren. I long to fold them to my poor aching heart. Remember, you\r\nhave promised that I shall see them in two hours!\"\r\n\r\n\"In two hours they shall be here, your majesty,\" said Van Swieten, as he\r\nhurried away.\r\n\r\n\"Stop a moment,\" cried Maria Theresa. \"As you have been the instigator\r\nof this thing, upon your shoulders shall fall the work that must arise\r\nfrom it. I exact of you, therefore, to superintend the inoculation of my\r\nsubjects, and your pay as chief medical inspector shall be five thousand\r\nflorins. I also give my palace at Hetzendorf as a model hospital for the\r\nreception of the children of fifty families, who shall there be\r\ninoculated and cared for at my expense. This is the monument I shall\r\nerect to my beloved Josepha; and when the little ones who are rescued\r\nfrom death thank God for their recovery, they will pray for my poor\r\nchild's departed soul. Does this please you, my son?\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor did not answer--his heart was too full for speech. The\r\nempress saw his agitation, and opening her arms to clasp him in her\r\nembrace, she faltered out, \"Come, dear child, and together let us mourn\r\nfor our beloved dead.\" [Footnote: The institution founded on that day by\r\nthe empress went very soon into operation. Every spring the children of\r\nfifty families among the nobles and gentry were received at the hospital\r\nof Hetzendorf. The empress was accustomed to visit the institution\r\nfrequently; and at the end of each season, she gave its little inmates a\r\nsplendid ball, which was always attended by herself and her daughters.\r\nThe festivities closed with concerts, lotteries, and a present to each\r\nchild.

Coxe, \"History of\r\nthe House of Austria,\" vol. v. p. 188.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nAN ADVENTURE.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely day in June--one of those glorious days when field and\r\nwood are like a lofty cathedral, where the birds are the choir, and the\r\nwind stirring the censers of the forest perfume, is the organ; while\r\nman, in ecstasy with nature's beauty, glances enraptured from heaven to\r\nearth--from earth again to heaven.\r\n\r\nBut pleasantest of all on such a day are the reveries that come and go\r\nover the heart, under the shade of a noble oak that lifts its crowned\r\nhead to the clouds, while birds twitter love-songs among its branches,\r\nand lovers lie dreaming on the green sward below.\r\n\r\nSo thought a young man as he reclined under the shadow of a tall\r\nbeech-tree that skirted the green border of a meadow, somewhere near the\r\nwoods around Schonbrunn. He had fastened his horse to a tree not far\r\noff, and while the steed cropped the fresh grass, its owner revelled in\r\nthe luxury of sylvan solitude. With an expression of quiet enjoyment he\r\nglanced now upon the soft, green meadow, now at the dim, shady woods,\r\nand then at the blue and silver sky that parted him from heaven.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! how delightful it is,\" thought he, \"to drop the shackles of\r\nroyalty, and to be a man! Oh, beautiful sky, with livery of 'kaiser\r\nblue,' change thy hue, and hide me in a dark cloud that I may be safe\r\nfrom the homage of courtiers and sycophants! If they knew that I was\r\nhere, how soon would they pursue and imprison me again in my gilded cage\r\nof imperial grandeur!\"\r\n\r\nJust then, in the distance, was heard the sound of a hunting horn, and\r\nthe emperor's soliloquy was cut short. An expression of annoyance was\r\nvisible on his features, as he listened. But instead of advancing, the\r\nsounds receded until finally they were lost in the sighing of the wind\r\namong the forest-trees.\r\n\r\n\"They have passed by,\" exclaimed he joyfully. \"This day is mine, and I\r\nam free. What a charm is in that word FREEDOM! I feel it now; no emperor\r\nam I, but a man, to whom the animals will turn their backs, without\r\nsuspecting that they refuse to look upon an anointed sovereign. But\r\nhark! what is that? A doe--a timid doe--perhaps an enchanted princess\r\nwho can resume her shape at the bidding of a prince only. Here am I,\r\nsweet princess--ready, as soon as you become a woman, to leap into your\r\narms.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor grasped his fowling-piece that was leaning against the\r\nbeech. But the doe caught the sound, raised her graceful head, and her\r\nmild eye sought the enemy that threatened her. She saw him, and as he\r\nraised the gun to take aim, she cleared the road with one wild bound,\r\nand in a few moments was lost in a thicket.\r\n\r\nThe emperor leaped on his horse, exclaiming, \"I must catch my enchanted\r\nprincess;\" and giving his steed the rein, away they flew on the track of\r\nthe doe; away they flew over fallen trunks and through brier and copse,\r\nuntil the panting steed would have recoiled before a wide hedge--but the\r\nemperor cried, \"Over it! over it! The princess is beyond!\" and the\r\nfoaming horse gathered up his forelegs for the leap. He made a spring,\r\nbut missed, and with a loud crash, horse and rider fell into the ditch\r\non the farther side of the hedge.\r\n\r\nThe emperor fell under the horse, who, in its efforts to rise, inflicted\r\ndreadful suffering upon its master. He felt that his senses were leaving\r\nhim, and thought that he was being crushed to death. The load upon his\r\nbreast was insufferable, and in his ears there came a sound like the\r\nroaring of the ocean. He uttered one cry for help, commended himself to\r\nHeaven, and fainted.\r\n\r\nHow long he lay there, he never knew. When he opened his weary eyes\r\nagain, he lay on the sward near the hedge, with his head resting upon\r\nthe lap of a beautiful girl, who was contemplating him with looks of\r\ntenderest pity. By her side knelt another young girl, who was bathing\r\nhis temples with water.\r\n\r\n\"Look, Marianne,\" exclaimed she joyfully; \"he begins to move. Oh, dear\r\nsister, we have saved his life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, Kathi,\" whispered the other. \"He has not yet his senses. He\r\nlooks as if he were dreaming of angels. But he will soon awake.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't wonder that be dreams of angels, Marianne, when he looks at\r\nyou,\" said Kathi, contemplating her beautiful sister. \"But now that he\r\nis safe, I will go and look after his horse. Poor animal! he trembles\r\nyet with fright, and I think he has lamed his leg. I will lead him to\r\nthe spring where he can drink and cool his foot. You know the curate\r\nsays that water is a great doctor for man and beast.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying she took up the bridle, and coaxing the horse gently, he\r\nfollowed her, although he shuddered with the pain of his limb.\r\n\r\nShe disappeared behind a little grove of trees, while her sister\r\ncontemplated their handsome patient. He lay perfectly quiet, his eyes\r\nopen, but feeling too weary for speech. He felt uncertain whether he\r\nwaked or dreamed, nor did he care; for the present moment was\r\nunutterably sweet. His pain was slight, and with his head pillowed upon\r\nthe lap of the lovely girl whose face was beautiful as that of Eve in\r\nthe groves of Eden, the emperor gazed on in rapture.\r\n\r\nMarianne became gradually aware that his glances spoke admiration, for\r\nher color slowly deepened, until it glowed like the petals of a\r\nnewly-opened rose. The emperor smiled as he watched her blushes. \"Do\r\nangels then blush?\" asked he softly.\r\n\r\n\"He still dreams,\" said Marianne, shaking her head. \"I thought just now\r\nthat his senses were returning.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, child,\" replied Joseph, \"I do not dream. I see before me the\r\nloveliest vision that ever blessed the eyes of man, or else--I have\r\novertaken the enchanted princess. Oh, princess! it was cruel of you to\r\nlure one over that treacherous hedge!\" Marianne looked alarmed. \"Poor,\r\npoor young man!\" murmured she in a low voice, \"he is delirious. I must\r\nmoisten his head again.\"\r\n\r\nShe extended her hand to the little pail that held the water, but Joseph\r\ncaught it, and pressed it warmly to his lips. Marianne blushed anew,\r\nwith painful embarrassment, and sought to withdraw her hand.\r\n\r\nThe emperor would not yield it. \"Let me kiss the hand of the angel that\r\nhas rescued me from death,\" said he. \"For 'tis you, is it not, who saved\r\nmy life?\"\r\n\r\n\"My sister and I, sir, were coming through the wood,\" replied Marianne,\r\n\"when we saw your horse galloping directly toward the hedge. We knew\r\nwhat must happen, and ran with all our might toward you, but before we\r\nreached you, the horse had made the leap. Oh, I shudder when I think of\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\nAnd her face grew white again, while her lustrous eyes were dimmed with\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\"Go on, go on, my--. No, I will not call you princess lest you should\r\nthink me delirious. I am not delirious, beautiful Marianne! but I dream,\r\nI dream of my boyhood and almost believe that I have come upon enchanted\r\nground. Your sweet voice--your lovely face --this delicious wood--it all\r\nseems like fairy-land! But speak on; where did you find me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Under the horse, sir; and the first thing we did was to free you from\r\nits weight. We took the rein, and, after some efforts, we got him to his\r\nfeet. Kathi led him away, and I--I--\"\r\n\r\n\"You, Marianne! tell me--what did you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I,\" said she, looking down--\"I bore you as well as I was able to this\r\nspot. I do not know how I did it, but fright gives one very great\r\nstrength.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on, go on!\"\r\n\r\n\"We had been gathering mushrooms in the woods, when we saw you. As soon\r\nas Kathi had tied the horse, she ran for her little pail, poured out the\r\nmushrooms, and filling it with water, we bathed your head until you\r\nrevived. This, sir, is the whole history, and now that you have\r\nrecovered, I will help you to rise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet, not yet, enchantress. I cannot raise my head from its\r\ndelicious pillow. Let me dream for a few moments longer. Fairy-land is\r\nalmost like heaven.\"\r\n\r\nMarianne said no more, but her eyes sought the ground, and her face grew\r\nscarlet. The emperor still gazed upon her wonderful beauty, and thought\r\nthat nothing he had ever seen in gilded halls could approach this\r\npeasant-girl, whose red dress and black bodice were more dazzling to his\r\neyes than the laces and diamonds of all Vienna assembled.\r\n\r\n\"Where,\" asked he, observing that her snowy shoulders were bare, \"where\r\ndid you get a kerchief to bathe my head?\"\r\n\r\nMarianne started and laid her hands upon her neck. \"Good Heaven!\"\r\nmurmured she to herself; \"it was the kerchief from my own bosom!\"\r\nUnconsciously she reached her hand to take it from the pail.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said Joseph, stopping her; \"would you wear that dripping\r\nkerchief? No, no! let the sky, the birds, and the wood-nymphs look at\r\nthose graceful shoulders; and if I may not look, I will shut my eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! do not shut your eyes; they are blue as the sky itself!\" replied\r\nMarianne. But as she spoke she drew forward the long braids that trailed\r\nbehind her on the ground, and quickly untwisting them, her hair fell in\r\nshowers around her neck and shoulders, so that they were effectually\r\nconcealed.\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" said the emperor. \"Your hair is as beautiful as the\r\nrest of your person. It surpasses the sables of a Russian princess. You\r\nknow perfectly well how to adorn yourself, you bewitching child.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not mean to adorn myself, sir,\" said Marianne. \"Why, then, did\r\nyou cover yourself with that superb mantle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because, sir, I--I was cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you so icy, then, that you freeze in midsummer?\"\r\n\r\nShe said nothing, but bent her head in confusion. Luckily, at that\r\nmoment, Kathi came in sight with the horse.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir,\" exclaimed Marianne, \"you can rise, can you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not unless you help me, for my head is yet very light.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, if that be so, then stay where you are, and try to sleep,\r\nwhile I pray to the blessed Virgin to protect you.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Kathi came forward, and, when she saw the emperor, nodded her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\"God be praised, sir,\" cried she, \"you have your senses once more! You\r\nhave gotten off cheaply with nothing but a black eye. But, bless me! how\r\nquiet you are, Marianne! Who would think, that while the gentleman was\r\nout of his senses, you were crying as if he had been your sweetheart!\r\nWhy, sir, her tears fell upon your face and waked you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me,\" whispered Marianne, \"I wiped them away with the kerchief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you deprive me of those sweet tears?\" whispered the emperor.\r\nBut Kathi was talking all the while.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" continued she, \"try to get up. Put one arm around me, and the\r\nother around Marianne, and we will set you upon your legs, to find out\r\nwhether they are sound. Come--one, two, three; now!\" With the help of\r\nthe strong peasant-girl, the emperor arose and stood erect. But he\r\ncomplained of dizziness, and would have Marianne to sustain him.\r\n\r\nShe approached with a smile, while he, drawing her gently to his side,\r\nlooked into her eyes. The poor girl trembled, she knew not why, for\r\nassuredly she was not afraid.\r\n\r\nKathi, who had gone back for the horse, now came up, leading him to his\r\nmaster. \"Now,\" said she, \"we are all ready to go. Your horse is a little\r\nlame, and not yet able to bear you. Whither shall we lead you, sir?\r\nWhere is your home?\"\r\n\r\n\"My home!\" exclaimed the emperor, with troubled mien. \"I had forgotten\r\nthat I had a home.\" This question had awakened him from his idyl.\r\n\r\n\"Where is my home?\" echoed he sadly. \"It is in Vienna. Can you put me on\r\nthe road thither?\"\r\n\r\n\"That can we, sir; but it is a long way for such a gentleman as you to\r\ntravel on foot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us go, then, to the highway, and perhaps I may there find some\r\nconveyance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" cried the gleeful Kathi, \"forward, march!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet, Kathi. Not until I have thanked you for the great service you\r\nhave rendered me. Let me give you some testimony of my gratitude. Before\r\nwe part, let me gratify some wish of yours. Speak first, Kathi.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm,\" said Kathi, \"I have many wishes. It is not so easy to say what I\r\nwant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, take time, and think for a moment, child.\"\r\n\r\nKathi looked as if she were making a bold resolve.\r\n\r\n\"That ring upon your finger--it is the prettiest thing I ever saw. Will\r\nyou give it to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kathi!\" exclaimed Marianne, \"how can you ask such a thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" returned Kathi, reddening; \"did he not tell me to say what I\r\nwanted?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Marianne in a low voice, \"but it may be a gift--perhaps it\r\nis from his sweetheart!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Marianne,\" replied the emperor sadly, \"I have no sweetheart. No one\r\ncares whether I give or keep the ring. Take it, Kathi.\"\r\n\r\nKathi held out her hand, and when it had been placed upon her finger she\r\nturned it around to see it glisten, and laughed for joy.\r\n\r\n\"And you, Marianne,\" said Joseph, changing his tone as he addressed the\r\nbeautiful creature who stood at his side, \"tell me your wish. Let it be\r\nsomething hard to perform, for then I shall be all the happier to grant\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nBut Marianne spoke not a word.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Marianne,\" cried Kathi impatiently, \"do you not see that he is a\r\nrich and great lord, who will give you any thing you ask? Why do you\r\nstand so dumb?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, dear Marianne,\" whispered the emperor, \"have you no wish that I\r\ncan gratify?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" cried Marianne, in a voice scarcely audible.\r\n\r\n\"Speak it, then, sweet one, and it shall be granted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, sir,\" said Marianne, her cheeks glowing, though her eyes were\r\nstill cast down, \"my father's house is hard by. Come and rest awhile\r\nunder his roof, and let me give you a glass of milk, and to your horse\r\nsome fresh hay.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor seemed to grow very weak while Marianne spoke, for he clung\r\nto her as though he had been afraid to fall.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Marianne,\" replied he, \"and God bless you for the kind suggestion!\r\nLet me for once forget the world and imagine that I, too, am a peasant,\r\nwith no thought of earth beyond these enchanted woods. Take me to the\r\ncottage where your father lives, and let me eat of his bread. I am\r\nhungry.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the emperor, with his strange suite, set off for the cottage of\r\nConrad the peasant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE JUDGMENT OF SOLOMON.\r\n\r\nOld Conrad stood in his doorway, shading his old eyes from the sunbeams,\r\nwhile he looked anxiously down the road that led to the village. It was\r\nnoonday, and yet the hearth of the kitchen was empty and cold. No kettle\r\nwas on the hob, no platter upon the table. And yet his daughters had\r\nstarted early for the woods, and surely they must have gathered their\r\nmushrooms hours ago.\r\n\r\nThe old peasant began to be anxious. If it had been Kathi alone, it\r\nwould have been easy enough to guess at the delay. She was gossiping\r\nwith Valentine, and forgetting that she had father or sister, home or\r\ndinner. But Marianne was along, and she never flirted or loitered. What\r\ncould be the matter? But--what was that coming up the road? Marianne!\r\nYes, truly, Marianne with a fine lord at her side, who seemed closer to\r\nher than propriety seemed to allow.\r\n\r\n\"Gracious Heaven!\" thought the old man, \"what has come over my bashful\r\nMarianne? What would the villagers say if they should see her now? And\r\nwhat comes behind? Kathi, with a horse. Are the maidens bewitched?\"\r\n\r\nThey came nearer; and now Kathi, from the top of her voice, bade him\r\ngood-day.\r\n\r\n\"Are we not fine, father?\" cried she, with a loud laugh. But Marianne,\r\ncoming forward with the emperor, bent gracefully before her old father.\r\n\r\n\"See, dear father,\" said she in her soft, musical tones, \"we bring you a\r\nguest who to-day will share our humble dinner with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"A guest whose life has been saved by your daughters,\" added Joseph,\r\nextending his hand.\r\n\r\n\"And a very rich somebody he must be, father,\" cried Kathi, \"for see how\r\nhe has paid us for our help. Look at this brave ring, how it glistens!\r\nIt is mine; and Marianne might have had as much if she had chosen. But\r\nwhat do you think she asked him?--to come home and get a glass of milk!\"\r\n\r\n\"That was well done of my Marianne,\" said the father, proudly. \"It would\r\nhave been a pity not to let me see the brave gentleman, if indeed you\r\nhave been so happy as to save his life. Come in, my lord, come in. You\r\nare welcome. What we have we give cordially.\"\r\n\r\n\"And therefore what you give will be gratefully received,\" replied the\r\nemperor, entering and seating himself.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir,\" said Marianne, \"I will go and prepare the dinner.\" So\r\nsaying, she passed into the cottage kitchen.\r\n\r\n\"That is a beautiful maiden,\" said Joseph, looking wistfully after the\r\ngraceful figure as it disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"They are my heart's joy, both of them,\" replied Conrad. \"They are brisk\r\nas fawns, and industrious as bees. And yet I am often sad as I look at\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I am old and poor. I have nothing to leave them, and when I\r\ndie, they will have to go to service. That frets me. It is because I\r\nlove the maidens so dearly that I am troubled about them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let their poverty trouble you no longer, my friend. I will provide for\r\nthem. I have it in my power to make them both comfortable, and that they\r\nshall be, I promise you.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man spoke his thanks, and presently came Marianne to announce\r\nthe dinner. It was served in an arbor covered with honeysuckles and red\r\nbeans, and the emperor thought that he had never had a better dinner in\r\nhis imperial palace. The shackles of his greatness had fallen from him,\r\nand he drank deeply of the present hour, without a thought for the\r\nmorrow. Marianne was at his side, and as he looked into the lustrous\r\ndepths of her dark eyes, he wished himself a peasant that he might look\r\ninto them forever.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Kathi and her father walked together in the garden. They were\r\nboth examining the diamond ring, and the hearts of both were filled with\r\nambitious thoughts and hopes.\r\n\r\n\"He must be very rich,\" said Kathi, in a low voice. \"He has fallen in\r\nlove with Marianne, 'tis plain, and she has only to ask and have any\r\nthing she likes. Look, father, he is kissing her! But don't let them see\r\nyou. The more he loves her, the more he will give us. But you must speak\r\nto Marianne, father. She is as silly as a sheep, and doesn't care\r\nwhether we are poor or rich. Call her here, and tell her that she MUST\r\nask for a great sum of money--enough for us to buy a fine farm. Then\r\nValentine will marry me at once, and I shall be able to give a\r\nwedding-dress to all the other maidens in the village.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose that the lord should want Marianne?\" asked Conrad, turning\r\npale.\r\n\r\nKathi still held up her ring, and she turned toward the sun until it\r\nseemed to be in a blaze. \"Look, father,\" said she, in a low tone,\r\n\"look.\"\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the old man were fixed upon the jewel; and strange hopes,\r\nwith which, until now, he had been unacquainted, stirred his heart. The\r\nserpent had found its way into Eden, and it spoke to both in the glitter\r\nof this unhappy ring.\r\n\r\n\"Father,\" said Kathi, at length, \"if Marianne had such a ring as this on\r\nher finger she would find many hundred wooers who would forgive her for\r\nhaving had ONE before them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\" cried the old man. \"If your mother were alive to hear these\r\nguilty words, she would think that you were no longer innocent yourself.\r\nHow I wish she were here in this trying hour! But since you have no\r\nparent but me, I must protect you from shame.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words the old man walked resolutely to the arbor, followed by\r\nKathi, who implored him not to ruin their fortunes.\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" said Conrad, \"the day wanes. If you intend to reach Vienna\r\ntonight, you have no time to lose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" thought Joseph, \"my dream is over. You are right,\" said he to\r\nthe peasant, \"unless you will shelter me to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have but one bed in my house, sir,\" replied Conrad, \"and that is in\r\nthe little room of my daughters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let me sleep there,\" said Joseph, with the arrogance of one\r\naccustomed to command.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" faltered Marianne, springing to her father's side, as though she\r\nwould seek protection from these ensnaring words.\r\n\r\nBut Kathi shook her sister's arm, and surveying her blushing face,\r\nexclaimed with a loud laugh, \"You are a fool. What harm can it do us, if\r\nthe gentleman sleeps in our room? We can make ourselves a bed of hay on\r\nthe floor, and give him the bedstead. No one will ever think any the\r\nless of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so, too,\" said Joseph, who was now resolved to see of what\r\nstuff the peasant was made. \"Do not hesitate so. Let me sleep in your\r\ndaughters' room, and I will give you a handful of gold for my lodging.\"\r\n\r\nKathi gave a cry of delight, and going close to her father, she\r\nwhispered, \"Father, you will not refuse! Think--a handful of gold! We\r\nwill be the richest farmers in the village! There are two of us--there\r\ncan be no danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" asked Joseph, impatiently, \"have you decided? Did you not tell\r\nme that you were poor? and is this not an opportunity I offer you to\r\nenrich your daughters!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" replied the old man, solemnly, \"I do not know whether this\r\nopportunity may not be for evil, instead of good. I am a poor and simple\r\nfarmer, and cannot decide for myself whether the mere fact of your\r\nsleeping in the same room with my daughters is right or not. Our curate\r\nis a very holy man; I will apply to him for advice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Joseph, \"go and fetch him, he shall decide.\"\r\n\r\nOld Conrad left the garden, followed again by Kathi, who was resolved to\r\nleave the great lord alone with her sister. Marianne, who before had\r\nbeen so happy and unembarrassed, now started forward with the intention\r\nof going with her father. But the emperor would not allow it. He caught\r\nher by both hands and held her fast.\r\n\r\n\"Stay, frightened doe,\" said he softly. \"You are right, dear child, to\r\ntremble before men, for they are full of deceit; but do not be afraid of\r\nme; I will not harm you.\"\r\n\r\nMarianne raised her dark, tearful eyes to his face, and gradually a\r\nsmile lit up her lovely features.\r\n\r\n\"I believe you, my lord,\" said she. \"You have, perhaps, already seen\r\nthat I would do any thing on earth for you, were it even to give up my\r\nlife; but for no one would I do that which my mother would blame if she\r\nwere living--on no account would I do that which I might not tell in\r\nprayer to my heavenly Father.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor looked once more at her lovely face.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Marianne! why are you a peasant!\" exclaimed he. Then raising his\r\neyes to heaven. \"Almighty God,\" continued he, \"shield her from harm. In\r\nThy presence I swear to protect her honor--even from myself. \"\r\n\r\nAt that moment old Conrad appeared in the road. At his side was a little\r\nold man in a faded cassock, whose spare white hair scarcely covered his\r\nbald head.\r\n\r\nJoseph came forward, holding Marianne by the hand. Kathi darted from the\r\nhouse, laughing vociferously. The priest advanced, his eyes fixed upon\r\nthe face of the stranger. All at once, pointing with his finger to\r\nJoseph, he cried out:\r\n\r\n\"Conrad, a great honor has befallen your house. Your guest is the\r\nemperor!\"\r\n\r\n\"The emperor!\" exclaimed three voices--two in joyous notes, the third\r\nwith the cry of despair.\r\n\r\nConrad and Kathi were on their knees; Marianne leaned deathly pale\r\nagainst the arbor.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, father,\" replied Joseph, mastering his annoyance at the\r\nrevelation; \"yes, I am the emperor. But, my friends, do not offer me\r\nsuch homage as belongs to God alone. Rise, Conrad. Old men should not\r\nkneel before young ones. Rise, Kathi. Men should kneel before pretty\r\nmaidens, no matter whether they be princesses or peasants. And now,\r\nfather, hear my petition. I am tired and suffering. I have had a fall\r\nfrom my horse, and I do not wish to go to-night to Vienna. I have\r\noffered this old man a handful of gold to give me his only bed--the one\r\nin his daughters' room. But he will not give his consent without your\r\napproval. Decide between us, and remember who it is that asks for\r\nlodging here.\"\r\n\r\nThe head of the old priest sank upon his breast.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" thought Kathi, \"I hope he will say yes.\"\r\n\r\nMarianne made not a movement, while her father looked anxiously toward\r\nthe priest.\r\n\r\n\"Well, father, well,\" cried Joseph. \"You say nothing--and yet I have\r\ntold you that the emperor craves a night's lodging in the room of these\r\nyoung girls. You see that I ask where I might command. I should think\r\nthat the lord of the whole land is also lord of the little room of two\r\npeasant-girls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty. You are lord of the room, but not of the honor of\r\nthese peasant-girls,\" replied the curate, raising his eyes, and steadily\r\nmeeting those of Joseph. [Footnote: \"Life of Joseph II., Emperor of\r\nAustria,\" vol iii., p. 89.]\r\n\r\n\"Nobly answered, father,\" replied the emperor, taking the old priest's\r\nhand, and pressing it between his own. \"Had you decided otherwise, I\r\nwould not have forgiven you. Before the servant of the Lord, the claims\r\nof the sovereign are on an equality with those of his subject. Pardon\r\nme, Conrad, for testing your honor as I did, and accept my horse as a\r\ntoken of my respect. If you should ever wish to sell him, bring him to\r\nthe imperial stables, and he will be ransomed by me for a thousand\r\nflorins.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, your majesty,\" said the happy old man, \"I shall die content for my\r\nchildren are provided for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now we are rich,\" cried Kathi, \"the best match in the village will be\r\nproud to marry either one of us.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor, meanwhile, took out his pocket-book, and, tearing out a\r\nleaf, wrote some words upon it.\r\n\r\nFolding the paper, he advanced to Marianne, and handing it to her, said:\r\n\r\n\"My dear child, when your father presents this paper to the marshal of\r\nmy household, Count Rosenberg, he will give him in return for you five\r\nhundred florins.\"\r\n\r\n\"Five hundred florins!\" exclaimed Kathi, with envious looks.\r\n\r\n\"Take the paper, Marianne,\" pleaded the emperor. \"It is your dowry.\"\r\n\r\nMarianne raised her tearful eyes, but her hands did not move to take the\r\ngift. She reflected for a moment, and then spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Five hundred florins,\" said she, \"is not that a large sum?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, my child,\" replied Joseph.\r\n\r\n\"More than the value of the ring you gave my sister, is it not?\" asked\r\nshe.\r\n\r\nThe emperor looked disappointed. \"Yes, Marianne,\" replied he, with a\r\nsigh. \"You have no reason to envy your sister. Kathi's ring is not worth\r\nmore than a hundred florins.\"\r\n\r\nHe still held the paper in his hands. Suddenly Marianne took it from\r\nhim, and crossed over to her sister.\r\n\r\n\"You hear, Kathi,\" said she, \"you hear what the emperor says. This paper\r\nis worth five times as much as your ring. Let us exchange.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, she held out the paper, while Kathi with a scream of delight,\r\nsnatched it from her hand, and as quick as thought, drew the ring from\r\nher own finger.\r\n\r\n\"If you repent your bargain, Marianne,\" said she, \"so much the worse for\r\nyou. The dowry is mine--and mine it shall remain.\"\r\n\r\nMarianne did not listen. She placed the ring upon her own hand, and\r\ncontemplated it with a smile of satisfaction. Then going up to the\r\npriest, she addressed him with a grace that would have been winning in a\r\ncountess.\r\n\r\n\"Father,\" said she, \"you have heard the exchange that Kathi and I have\r\nmade. The dowry is hers--the ring is mine. As long as I live, I shall\r\nwear this token of my emperor's condescending goodness. And when I die,\r\nfather, promise me that my ring shall go with me to the grave.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor, all etiquette forgetting, made a step forward, with his\r\narms extended. But recovering himself, he stopped; his arms dropped\r\nheavily to his side, and he heaved a deep, deep sigh.\r\n\r\nInstead of approaching Marianne, he drew near to the priest.\r\n\r\n\"Father,\" said he, \"my mother will perhaps feel some anxiety on my\r\naccount. Will you be so kind as to accompany me to the post-house, where\r\nI may perhaps be able to procure some vehicle for Vienna.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am ready, your majesty,\" replied the curate; \"and if it pleases you,\r\nwe will set out at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it,\" sighed Joseph. \"Farewell, Conrad,\" continued he; \"hearken to\r\nthe counsels of your excellent pastor, for he is a faithful servant of\r\nGod. Farewell, Kathi; now that you have a dowery, you will speedily find\r\na husband. Let me be godfather to the first baby.\"\r\n\r\nKathi blushed and laughed, while the emperor turned to the pale\r\nMarianne. He took her hand, and, pressing it to his lips, he said to the\r\npriest, who was looking on with anxious eyes--\r\n\r\n\"A man has the right to kiss the hand of a lovely and innocent girl like\r\nthis, even though he have the misfortune to be born an emperor. Has he\r\nnot, father?\"\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for an answer, Joseph dropped the poor little cold hand,\r\nand turned away.\r\n\r\nThe old priest followed, while Conrad and his daughters looked on,\r\nscarcely crediting the evidence of their senses.\r\n\r\nThe emperor had reached the cottage-gate, when suddenly he turned, and\r\nspoke again.\r\n\r\n\"Marianne, one last request. Will you give me the kerchief with which\r\nyou were bathing my head to-day? The evening air is pool about my\r\nthroat. I am subject to hoarseness.\"\r\n\r\nMarianne was trembling so that she could not answer. But Kathi came\r\nforward, and taking the kerchief from a rosebush where It had been hung\r\nto dry, she ran forward, and gave it into the emperor's hands.\r\n\r\nHe bowed, and continued his way.\r\n\r\nMarianne gazed wistfully down the road at the tall and noble form that\r\nwas disappearing from her sight--perhaps forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nTWO AFFIANCED QUEENS.\r\n\r\nThere was great activity in the private apartments of the empress. Maria\r\nTheresa, whose forenoons were usually dedicated to business of state,\r\nwas now engaged in giving audience to jewellers, milliners, and\r\nmantuamakers.\r\n\r\nFor whom were these preparations? No one knew, although every one\r\ndesired to know. The secret seemed especially to interest the two young\r\nArchduchesses Caroline and Marie Antoinette. These silks, satins, laces,\r\nand jewels signified--marriage. Of that, there could be no doubt. But\r\nwho was to be the bride? The Archduchess Elizabeth was past thirty.\r\nCould it be that there was any truth in the rumor of a projected\r\nmarriage between herself and the old King of France? She was tired of\r\nlife at the court of Austria, and would have welcomed the change, had\r\nthe negotiations which were pending on that subject ever come to\r\nanything. But they did not. [Footnote: They were frustrated by the\r\nCountess du Barry, who never forgave the Duke de Choiseul for\r\nentertaining the project. Du Barry prevailed upon the king to say that\r\nhe was too old to marry, and she revenged herself on Choiseul by\r\nbringing about his disgrace. Alex. Dumas, \"History of Louis XV.\"]\r\n\r\nCaroline and Marie Antoinette were very incredulous when it was hinted\r\nthat their mother's preparations were intended for their eldest sister.\r\nThey laughed at the absurdity of Elizabeth's faded pretensions.\r\n\r\n\"It must be that I am about to be married,\" said Caroline, as she\r\nentered her little sister's room one morning, in full dress. \"The\r\nempress has commanded my presence in her cabinet to-day, and that\r\nbetokens something unusual and important. But bless me you, too, are in\r\nfull dress?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Marie Antoinette, laughing, and echoing her sister's words,\r\n\"it must certainly be myself that is about to be married, for the\r\nempress has commanded my presence in her cabinet, and, of course, she\r\nhas something of great importance to communicate.\"\r\n\r\n\"How! You also?\" exclaimed Caroline. \"At what hour?\"\r\n\r\n\"At twelve exactly, your highness,\" answered Marie Antoinette, with a\r\ndeep courtesy.\r\n\r\n\"The same hour. Then we must go together. I suppose that the empress\r\nintends to propose a husband for me, and a new tutor for you,\r\nAntoinette.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray, why not a husband?\" laughed Marie Antoinette.\r\n\r\n\"Because, you saucy child,\" replied her sister, \"husbands are not dolls\r\nfor little girls to play with.\"\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette tossed her pretty bead, saying, \"Let me tell you,\r\nCaroline, that little girls are sometimes as wise as their elders, and I\r\nshall give you a proof of my superior wisdom, by not returning irony for\r\nirony. Perhaps it may be you who is to be married--perhaps it may be\r\nboth of us. There are more crowns in Europe than one. But hark! there\r\nsounds the clock. The empress expects us.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave her hand to her sister, and the two princesses went laughing\r\ntogether to their mother's room.\r\n\r\nThe empress received them with an affectionate smile, and although her\r\ndaughters were accustomed to stand in her presence, to-day she told them\r\nto sit on either side of her.\r\n\r\nThey were both beautiful, and their mother surveyed them with pride and\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n\"Come, dear children,\" said she, \"we will banish etiquette for a while.\r\nTo-day I am no empress, I am but a mother. But why do you both smile so\r\nsignificantly at one another? Are you guessing at what is to be the\r\nsubject of our interview?\"\r\n\r\n\"What can it be, your majesty,\" said Caroline gayly, \"but the\r\nexplanation of the riddle that has been puzzling all the brains in the\r\npalace for a month past?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have guessed,\" answered Maria Theresa, laughing. \"It is of your own\r\nmarriage that I would speak. I have accepted a crown for you, my\r\nCaroline, and the ambassador who will conduct you to your kingdom is\r\nalready on his way. Your trousseau is magnificent and worthy of a queen.\r\nYour fair brow was made for a royal diadem, and in yonder room lies one\r\nthat is made up of a constellation of diamonds.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the king--the man--who is he?\" asked Caroline anxiously. \"Tell me,\r\nyour majesty, to whom I am affianced?\"\r\n\r\nThe empress's brow grew ruffled.\r\n\r\n\"My daughter,\" said she, \"a princess marries not a king, but a kingdom.\r\nIt is given to few mortals wearing crowns to add to their royalty\r\ndomestic happiness. It becomes you more to ask whether you are to be a\r\ngreat and powerful queen, than the name of the man who is to place his\r\ncrown upon your head.\"\r\n\r\nThe princess was silent, but she said to herself, \"If she means to hand\r\nme over to the horrid old King of France, I shall say emphatically--No!\"\r\n\r\nThe empress went on. \"Diplomacy is the wooer of royal maidens, and\r\ndiplomacy has chosen you both. For you, too, my little Antoinette, are\r\npromised to the heir of a crown.\"\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette nodded to Caroline. \"I told you so,\" said she. \"Mamma\r\ndid not call me hither to propose a new tutor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dear,\" said the empress, laughing, \"I did call you hither for\r\nthat object also. A little girl who is destined to reign over one of the\r\ngreatest nations in the world must prepare herself conscientiously to\r\nfill her station worthily. You have a noble mission, my child; through\r\nyour marriage the enmity so long subsisting between Austria and France\r\nshall be converted into amity and concord.\"\r\n\r\n\"France!\" screamed Antoinette. \"Your majesty would surely not marry me\r\nto the horrid old Louis XV.!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no!\" replied the empress, heartily amused. \"You are affianced to his\r\ngrandson, who one of these days will be called Louis XVI.\"\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette uttered a cry and started from her seat. \"Oh my God!\"\r\nexclaimed she.\r\n\r\n\"What--what is the matter?\" cried Maria Theresa. \"Speak, my child, what\r\nails you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" murmured Antoinette, shaking her head sadly. \"Your majesty\r\nwould only laugh.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it? I insist upon knowing why it is that you shudder at the\r\nname of Louis XVI.? Have you heard aught to his disadvantage? Has your\r\nbrother the emperor--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" interrupted Marie Antoinette, quickly, \"the emperor has never\r\nmentioned his name to me. No one has ever spoken disparagingly of the\r\ndauphin in my presence. What made me shudder at the mention of his\r\ntitle, is the recollection of a fearful prophecy which was related to me\r\nyesterday, by my French teacher, as we were reading the hisory of\r\nCatherine de Medicis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell it to me, then, my daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since your majesty commands me, I obey,\" said the young girl,\r\ngracefully inclining her head. \"Catherine de Medicis, though she was\r\nvery learned, was a very superstitious woman. One of her astrologers\r\nowned a magic looking-glass. He brought it before the queen, and she\r\ncommanded him to show her in the mirror the destiny of her royal house.\r\nHe obeyed, and drew back the curtain that covered the face of the\r\nlooking-glass.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what did she see there?\" asked the empress, with interest.\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette continued: \"She saw the lily-decked throne of France;\r\nand upon it appeared, one after another, her sons, Henry, Francis, and\r\nCharles. Then came her hated son-in-law, Henry of Navarre; after him,\r\nLouis XIII.--then his grandson, Louis XIV., then Louis XV.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then she saw nothing. She waited a few moments after Louis XV. had\r\ndisappeared, and then she saw a figure with a crown upon his head, but\r\nthis figure soon was hidden by a cloud; and, in his place, the throne\r\nwas filled with snakes and cats, who were tearing each other to pieces.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fearful sight!\" said Maria Theresa, rising from her seat and walking\r\nabout the room.\r\n\r\n\"It was fearful to Catherine de Medicis, your majesty, for she fainted.\r\nNow you know why I dread to be the bride of the one who is to be called\r\nLouis XVI.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress said nothing. For a while, she went to and fro through the\r\nroom; then she resumed her seat, and threw back her proud head with a\r\nforced smile.\r\n\r\n\"These are silly fables,\" said she, \"tales with which nurses might\r\nfrighten little children, but only fit to provoke laughter from rational\r\nbeings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your majesty,\" interposed Antoinette \"but Louis XV. is not\r\ntoo rational to be affected by them.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that, child?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it, your majesty, because Monsieur le Maitre, who published this\r\nprophecy in his journal 'L'Espion Ture,' was imprisoned for fifteen\r\nyears in the Bastile, on account of it. He is still there, although he\r\nhas powerful friends who have interceded for him in vain.\" [Footnote:\r\nSwinburne, p. 60.]\r\n\r\n\"And Aufresne told you all this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"He ought to go to the Bastile with Le Maitre, then. But I hope that my\r\nlittle Antoinette has too much sense to be affected by Aufresne's\r\nnonsense, and that she will accept the husband whom her sovereign and\r\nmother has chosen for her. It is a bright destiny, that of a Queen of\r\nFrance; and if snakes and cats should come near your throne, you must\r\ntread them under foot. Look up, my child, and have courage. In two years\r\nyou will be the bride of the dauphin. Prepare yourself meanwhile to be a\r\nworthy representative of your native Austria. The Queen of France must,\r\nas far as she is able, assimilate herself to the customs and language of\r\nher people. With that intention, Prince Kaunitz has commissioned the\r\nDuke de Choiseul to select you a new teacher. He will be accompanied by\r\ntwo French ladies of honor. These people, my dear, are to form your\r\nmanners according to the requirements of court etiquette in France; but\r\nin your heart, my child, I trust that you will always be an Austrian.\r\nThat you may not be too French, Gluck will continue to give you music\r\nlessons. I flatter myself that the French cannot compete with us in\r\nmusic. Study well, and try to deserve the brilliant destiny in store for\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nShe drew Antoinette close to her and kissed her fondly.\r\n\r\n\"I will obey your majesty in all things,\" whispered the child, and sadly\r\nshe resumed her seat.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Caroline,\" continued the empress, \"a word with you. You see with\r\nwhat modesty and submission your sister has accepted her destiny. Follow\r\nher example, and prepare yourself to receive your affianced husband,\r\nFerdinand of Naples.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Caroline, now, who turned pale and shuddered. She uttered a cry\r\nof horror, and raised her hands in abhorrence. \"Never! Never, your\r\nmajesty,\" cried she, \"I cannot do it. You would not be so unnatural as\r\nto--\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not?\" asked the empress, coldly.\r\n\r\n\"Because God Himself has declared against our alliance with the King of\r\nNaples. He it is who interposed to save my sisters from this marriage.\r\nIn mercy, my mother, do not sentence me also to death!\"\r\n\r\nThe empress grew pale, and her lip quivered. But Maria Theresa, was\r\nforever warring with her own emotions, so that nothing was gained for\r\nCaroline by this appeal to her maternal love.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed she, recovering her self-possession. \"do you also seek\r\nto frighten me? I am not the cowardly simpleton for which you mistake\r\nme. As if the King of Naples were a vampire, to murder his wives at dead\r\nof night! No, Caroline, no! If it has pleased the Almighty to afflict\r\nme, by taking to Himself the two dear children who were to have been\r\nQueens of Naples, it is a sad coincidence--nothing more.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I cannot marry him!\" cried Caroline, wringing her hands; \"I should\r\nbe forever seeing at his side the spectral figures of my dead sisters.\r\nMother, dear mother, have pity on me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Have pity on her!\" echoed Antoinette, kneeling at the empress's feet.\r\n\r\n\"Enough!\" exclaimed Maria Theresa, in a commanding voice. \"I have\r\nspoken, it is for you to obey; for my word has been given, and I cannot\r\nretract. If, as your mother, I feel my heart grow weak with sympathy for\r\nyour weakness, as your empress, I spurn its cowardly promptings; for my\r\nimperial word shall be held sacred, if it cost me my life. Rise, both of\r\nyou. It ill becomes the Queens of France and Naples to bow their knees\r\nlike beggars. Obedience is more praiseworthy than humiliation. Go to\r\nyour apartments; pray for courage to bear your crosses, and God's\r\nblessing will shield you from all evil.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will pray God to give me grace to die in His favor,\" faltered\r\nCaroline.\r\n\r\n\"I will pray Him to take my life at once, rather than I should live to\r\nshare the destiny of Louis XVI.!\" whispered Antoinette, while the two\r\nimperial martyrs bowed low before their mother, and retired each to her\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa looked after their sweet, childish figures, and when the\r\ndoor had closed upon them, she buried her face in the cushions of the\r\nsofa where they had been sitting together, and wept.\r\n\r\n\"My children! my children! Each a queen, and both in tears! Oh, Heavenly\r\nFather, grant that I may not have erred, in forcing this weight of\r\nroyalty upon their tender heads. Mother of God, thou hast loved a child!\r\nBy that holy love, pray for those who would faint if their crowns should\r\nbe of thorns!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPEROR OF AUSTRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nTHE DINNER AT THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR'S.\r\n\r\nPrince Kaunitz sat lazily reclining in his arm-chair, playing with his\r\njewelled snuff-box and listening with an appearance of unconcern to a\r\nman who, in an attitude of profoundest respect, was relating to him a\r\nremarkable story of a young emperor and a beautiful peasant-girl, in\r\nwhich there was much talk of woods, diamonds, milk, and an Arabian\r\nsteed.\r\n\r\nThe smile that was upon the face of the minister might either betoken\r\namusement or incredulity.\r\n\r\nThe detective was at that period of his story where the emperor parted\r\nfrom old Conrad and his daughters. He now paused to see the effect of\r\nhis narration.\r\n\r\n\"Very pretty, indeed,\" said the prince, nodding his head, \"but romances\r\nare out of fashion. In these days we prefer truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does your highness suppose I am not speaking truth'?\" said the man.\r\n\r\nKaunitz took a pinch of snuff, and replied coldly, \"I suppose nothing\r\nabout it. Somebody, I know, has been playing upon your love of the\r\nmarvellous. I know that you are not telling me the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your highness!\" exclaimed Eberhard, with the air of an injured man, \"no\r\none can impose upon my credulity, for I believe nothing but that which I\r\nsee. I had this adventure from old Conrad himself, and I saw him receive\r\na thousand ducats for the horse. In the joy of his foolish old heart, he\r\ntold me the whole story; and as he saw the deep interest which I felt in\r\nthe tale, he invited me to his house, where I saw the beautiful\r\nMarianne, with her diamond on her finger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you acted like a fool; for the emperor knows you as well as all\r\nVienna does, and he will be furious when he discovers that we have been\r\nwatching his pastoral amours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, your highness is right, I would be a poor fool to go there\r\nwithout great precaution; for, as you very justly remarked, I am well\r\nknown in Vienna. But when I made the old peasant's acquaintance I was\r\ndisguised, and I defy anybody to know me when I choose to play\r\nincognito. I wore a gray wig and a black patch over one eye. In this\r\ndress I visited them, and had the story all over again, with variations,\r\nfrom that coquettish village beauty, Kathi.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long ago?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three weeks, your highness.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many times since then has the emperor visited his inamorata?\"\r\n\r\n\"Six times, your highness. Old Conrad has bought a farm, where he lives\r\nin a handsome house, in which each of his daughters now has a room of\r\nher own. Marianne's room opens on the garden, where the emperor drinks\r\nhis milk and enjoys the privilege of her society.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have the girls any lovers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, your highness; but they have grown so proud that Kathi will\r\nhave nothing to say to her sweetheart, Valentine; while Marianne, it is\r\nsaid has never encouraged any of the young men in the village. Indeed,\r\nthey are all afraid of her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because they know that the emperor honors her with his presence?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your highness, the emperor has not allowed the family to whisper a\r\nword of his agency in their newly-gotten wealth. They give out that it\r\nis a legacy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do the emperor and Marianne see one another in secret, without the\r\ncurate and the father's knowledge?\"\r\n\r\nEberhard shrugged his shoulders. \"Day before yesterday, Marianne went\r\nalone to the woods to gather mushrooms, and never came home until dusk.\r\nShe had been lost in the woods. It was the day on which the emperor was\r\nto visit the farm, but he did not come. Perhaps he got lost too.\r\nTo-morrow, Marianne is to gather mushrooms again. I, too, shall go--to\r\ncut wood,\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\" asked Kaunitz.\r\n\r\n\"That is all, for to-day, your highness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. Go home and invent a continuation of your story. Let no one\r\nknow of it meanwhile except myself. You can boast of more than some\r\npoets and literati can say, for you have amused me, and I will reward\r\nyou. Here are two gold ducats for you.\"\r\n\r\nEberhard bowed low as he received them, but when he had left the room,\r\nand was out of sight of Kaunitz, he turned toward the door muttering,\r\n\"As if I were such a fool as to sell my precious secret to you for two\r\npaltry ducats! I know of others who will pay me for my news, and they\r\nshall have it.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Kaunitz, buried in his arm-chair, was revolving the story is\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\n\"An emperor, a widower of two wives,\" said he to himself, \"and he treats\r\nus to an idyl of the genuine Gessner stamp! An imperial Damon who spends\r\nhis time twining wreaths of roses with his Philis! Well--he had better\r\nbe left to play the fool in peace; his pastoral will keep him from\r\nmeddling in state affairs. Men call me the coachman of European\r\npolitics; so be it, and let no one meddle with my coach-box. That noble\r\nempress is of one mind with me, but this emperor would like to snatch\r\nthe reins, and go careering over the heavens for himself. So much the\r\nbetter if he flirts and drinks milk with a dairymaid. But how long will\r\nit last? Eberhard, of course, has gone to Porhammer, who being piously\r\ndisinclined to such little pastimes, will go straight to the empress;\r\nand then Damon will be reproved, and I--I may fall under her displeasure\r\nfor having known and concealed her son's intrigue. What shall I do?\r\nShall I warn the emperor so that he can carry off his Semele, and go on\r\nwith his amours? Or shall I--bah! Let things shape themselves. What do I\r\ncare for them all? I am the coachman of Europe, and they are my\r\npassengers.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Kaunitz threw back his head, and, being alone, indulged\r\nhimself in a chuckle. It was speedily smothered, however, for three taps\r\nat the door announced the approach of the minister's valet.\r\n\r\n\"The fool intends to remind me that it is time to dress,\" said he to\r\nhimself. \"There must be some important engagement on hand to make him so\r\naudacious. Come in, Hippolyte!--Any engagement for dinner?\" asked he, as\r\nHippolyte made his appearance.\r\n\r\n\"So please your highness, you dine to-day with the Frenoh ambassador.\"\r\n\r\n\"What o'clock is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three o'clock, your highness.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is time. Tell the cook to send my dinner to the palace of the French\r\nambassador. His excellency knows the terms on which I dine out of my own\r\nhouse?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had the honor to explain them fully, your highness.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he acceded to them?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did, your highness. Your highness, he said, was welcome to bring\r\nyour dinner, if you preferred it to his. He had one request, however, to\r\nmake, which was that you would not bring your post-dessert; a request\r\nwhich I did not understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand it perfectly. The Count de Breteuil means that he would\r\nlike me to leave my mouth-cleaning apparatus at home. Come, since it is\r\ntime, let us begin to dress.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he rose, and presently he was walking to and fro in the\r\npowder-room, buried in his white mantle, while the servants waved their\r\npowder-brushes, and the air was dense with white clouds.\r\n\r\n\"Order the carriage,\" said the prince, when Hippolyte had presented the\r\nsnuff-box and the handkerchief of cobweb cambric and lace. \"Three\r\nfootmen to stand behind my chair.\"\r\n\r\nHippolyte went to order the footmen to the hotel of the Count de\r\nBreteuil, while his master slowly made his way to the anteroom where six\r\nlackeys awaited him, each one bearing aloft a long silk cloak.\r\n\r\n\"What says the thermometer to-day?\" asked he.\r\n\r\nThe lackey with the first cloak stepped to a window and examined the\r\nthermometer that was fastened outside.\r\n\r\n\"Sixty degrees, your highness--temperate,\" said the man.\r\n\r\n\"Cold! Four cloaks,\" said Kaunitz; and stepping through the row of\r\nservants, one after the other laid cloak upon cloak over his shoulders.\r\nWhen the fourth one had been wrapped around him, he ordered a fifth for\r\nhis return, and putting his handkerchief to his mouth for fear he might\r\nswallow a breath of air, the coachman of Europe proceeded to his\r\ncarriage, where Hippolyte was ready to help him in.\r\n\r\n\"Is my mouth-cleaning apparatus in the rumble?\" asked the prince, as he\r\nsank back in the soft cushions.\r\n\r\n\"Your highness said that his excellency had requested--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I did not say that I should heed his excellency's request.\r\nQuick, and bring it hither! Cups, brushes, essences, and every thing!\"\r\n\r\nOff started Hippolyte, and Kaunitz drew his four cloaks around his\r\nprecious person while he muttered to himself, \"I shall show my lord,\r\nCount de Breteuil, that the man who has the honor of receiving Kaunitz\r\nat his table, makes no conditions with such a guest. The French\r\nambassador grows arrogant, and I must teach him that the rules of\r\netiquette and customs of society are for him and his compeers, but not\r\nfor me. Whatever Kaunitz does is becoming and en regle. Voila\r\ntout.--Forward!\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Count de Breteuil was receiving his distinguished guests.\r\nAfter the topics of the day had been discussed, he informed them that he\r\nwas glad to be able to promise that Prince Kaunitz would come to dinner\r\nwithout his abominable apparatus.\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\" exclaimed the ladies.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" replied the count. \"I have complied with one of his absurd\r\nconditions--he brings his dinner; but I made it my especial request that\r\nhe would omit his usual post-dessert.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he agreed?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would appear so, since he has accepted. It must be so, for see, he\r\nis here.\"\r\n\r\nThe count went forward to meet the prince, who deigned not the smallest\r\napology for having kept the guests waiting a whole hour.\r\n\r\nThey repaired to the dining-room, where a costly and luxurious dinner\r\nmade amends to the company for their protracted fast.\r\n\r\nKaunitz, however, took no notice of these delicate viands. He ate his\r\nown dinner, and was served by his own lackeys.\r\n\r\n\"Your highness,\" said his neighbor, the Princess Esterhazy, \"you should\r\ntaste this pate a la Soubise, it is delicious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows what abominable ingredients may not have gone into its\r\ncomposition?\" said Kaunitz. \"I might poison myself if I tasted the\r\nvillanous compound. It is all very well for ordinary people to eat from\r\nother men's kitchens. If they die the ranks close up and nobody misses\r\nthem; but I owe my life to Austria and to Europe. Eat your pate a la\r\nSoubise, if it suit you; I eat nothing but viands a la Kaunitz, and I\r\ntrust to no cook but my own.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the same with the Tokay, the Johannisberg and the Champagne.\r\nKaunitz affected not to see them, while one of his lackeys reached him a\r\nglass of water on a golden salver. Kaunitz held it up to the light. \"How\r\ndare you bring me water from the count's fountain?\" said he, with a\r\nthreatening look.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, your highness,\" stammered the frightened servant, \"I drew it\r\nmyself from your highness's own fountain.\"\r\n\r\n\"How,\" laughed the Princess Esterhazy, \"you bring your water, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madame, I do, for it is the purest water in Vienna, and I have\r\nalready told you that my health is of the first importance to Austria.\r\nBread, Baptiste!\"\r\n\r\nBaptiste was behind the chair, with a golden plate, on which lay two or\r\nthree slices of bread, which he presented.\r\n\r\n\"And bread, too, from his house,\" cried the princess, laughing\r\nimmoderately.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madame,\" replied Kaunitz, gravely, \"I eat no bread but that of my\r\nown baker.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" replied the gay young princess. \"I am not surprised at your taking\r\nsuch wondrous good care of yourself; what astonishes me is, that you\r\nshould be allowed to enjoy such privileges in a house that is not your\r\nown. Why, Louis XIV. could not have been more exacting when he\r\ncondescended to dine with a subject!\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz raised his cold blue eyes so as to meet the look of the bold\r\nspeaker. \"Madame,\" said he, \"Louis XIV. was Louis XIV., and I am\r\nKaunitz.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he took a glass of water from HIS fountain, and ate a piece\r\nof bread from HIS baker. He then leaned back in his chair and took an\r\nanimated part in the conversation.\r\n\r\nThis was only because thereby he knew that he would dazzle his hearers\r\nby speaking English, French, Italian, or Spanish, as occasion required.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was at an end and dessert came on the table. Of course\r\nKaunitz refused to partake of it; but while the other guests were\r\nenjoying their confections, he took advantage of a pause in the\r\nconversation, to say to his pretty neighbor:\r\n\r\n\"Now, princess, that the company have enjoyed THEIR dessert, I shall\r\ntake the liberty of ordering MINE.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you have your own dessert?\" asked the princess, while the guests\r\nlistened to hear what was coming.\r\n\r\n\"I have,\" said Kaunitz. \"I have brought my dessert, of course.\r\nHippolyte, my etui.\"\r\n\r\nHippolyte brought the offensive etui and laid it on the dinner-table,\r\nwhile Baptiste approached with a glass of water. Kaunitz opened the case\r\nwith quiet indifference and examined its content. There were several\r\nsmall mirrors, various kinds of brushes, scissors, knives, a whet-stone,\r\nand a pile of little linen napkins. [Footnote: Swinburne, vol i., page\r\n353.]\r\n\r\nWhile Kaunitz examined and took out his disgusting little utensils the\r\nladies looked at Count Breteuil, who could scarcely credit the evidence\r\nof his senses. But as Kaunitz set a looking-glass before him, raised his\r\nupper lip, and closed his teeth, preparatory to a cleaning, the count\r\nrose indignant from his seat.\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said he, \"we will return to the drawing-room for\r\ncoffee; Prince Kaunitz desires this room to himself.\"\r\n\r\nThe company departed, leaving Kaunitz alone. He did not look as if he\r\nhad heard or seen any thing. He went on grinning, brushing his teeth,\r\ndrying them in and out with his napkins, and finished off with washing\r\nhis hands and cleaning his nails. This done, he walked deliberately back\r\nto the drawing-room, and, going immediately toward the host, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Count, I am about to return home. You have taken very great pains to\r\nprepare a dinner for me, and I shall make you a princely return. From\r\nthis day forward I dine no more from home; your dinner, therefore, will\r\nbe immortal, for history will relate that the last time Prince Kaunitz\r\ndined away from his own palace, he dined at that of the French\r\nambassador.\" With this he bowed, and slowly left the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nMARIANNE'S DISAPPEARANCE.\r\n\r\nKaunitz remained true to his policy in the drama of \"The Emperor and the\r\nDairy-Maid.\" He allowed things to run their course. Twice a week,\r\nEberhard came with additional information to which the minister listened\r\nwith deep interest, but his interest never took the shape of action.\r\nWhat did he care?\r\n\r\n\"This imperial idyl is a disease,\" thought he. \"It will have its crisis\r\nby and by, like a cutaneous eruption. Let it come. Why should I help the\r\npatient when I have not been called in?\"\r\n\r\nNot long after, however, he was called in. One morning he was lying in\r\nhis dressing-gown on a divan, his head bound up in half a dozen silk\r\nhandkerchiefs, and his whole person in the primeval disorder of a\r\nslovenly neglige, when his valet announced--the Emperor Joseph.\r\n\r\nKaunitz half rose, saying with a yawn, \"Show his majesty to the state\r\nreception-room, and beg him to await me there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no time to wait, my dear prince,\" said a soft and melancholy\r\nvoice behind him; and, as Kaunitz turned round, he saw the emperor who\r\nwas already at his side.\r\n\r\nThe prince motioned to Hippolyte to leave the room. He went out on\r\ntiptoe, and, as he reached the threshold, the emperor himself closed the\r\ndoor and locked it. Kaunitz, who had risen, stood in the middle of the\r\nroom, looking as indifferent to the visit of an emperor as to that of a\r\ntailor.\r\n\r\n\"Prince,\" said Joseph, returning and offering his hand, \"we have not\r\nhitherto been good friends, but you see that I hold you in esteem, for I\r\ncome to claim your assistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I expected your majesty,\" replied Kaunitz.\r\n\r\nThe emperor cast his eyes over the velvet dressing-gown and the half\r\ndozen head handkerchiefs, and looked his astonishment. The prince\r\nunderstood the glance, and replied to it.\r\n\r\n\"I did not expect your majesty quite so soon. A few hours later I would\r\nhave been ready to receive you. Will you permit me to retire for a few\r\nmoments, that I may at least make my head, if not the rest of my person,\r\npresentable?\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor took the hand of the prince and led him back to the divan.\r\n\"My dear Kaunitz,\" said he, \"when a man's head is in such a maze as mine\r\nto-day, he concerns himself very little about the looks of other men.\r\nSit down again, and I will take this armchair by you.\"\r\n\r\nHe drew Kaunitz, with gentle force, upon the divan, and then seated\r\nhimself at his side.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what brings me to you?\" said Joseph, blushing.\r\n\r\n\"I believe that I do, your majesty. It is no state affair, for on state\r\naffairs, unhappily, we are ever at variance.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor laughed a sardonic laugh. \"What need have I of a state\r\ncouncillor, I who am but a puppet in the hands of my mother, I who must\r\nstand, with shackled arms, and look on while she reigns? But it is in\r\nvain to murmur. I watch and wait; and while I wait, I find myself\r\ninclining fast to your policy. I believe you to be an honorable\r\nstatesman, and I believe also that the course you have pursued, you have\r\nchose because you are convinced that it is wise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty means the French alliance,\" said Kaunitz. \"You, like your\r\ndeceased father, have always opposed it, and but for the firmness of and\r\nwisdom of the empress, it would have failed. But we need not discuss\r\nthis matter to-day; I owe the honor conferred upon me to another\r\nquestion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you know why I am here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe that I know,\" replied Kaunitz, playing with the silk tassels\r\nof his dressing-gown. \"I have lately heard a tale about an emperor who\r\nwas lost in a forest and rescued by a peasant-girl. The sovereign was\r\ngrateful, as a matter of course, and the damsel forthwith melted away\r\nwith love at the sight of him, as Semele did for Jupiter. That, too, may\r\nbe very natural; but let me tell your majesty, it is dangerous for the\r\ncommittee on morals do not approve of such pastorals, and the empress--\"\r\n\r\n\"That accursed committee!\" cried Joseph. \"It is they who discovered it,\r\nand you who betrayed me.\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz slightly elevated his shoulders, and his eyes rested, unmoved,\r\nupon the emperor's glowing face. \"I have never yet,\" said he, \"descended\r\nto the office of an informer. Had your majesty addressed me on this\r\nsubject some weeks ago, I should have said to you, 'You are dreaming a\r\nvery pretty dream of innocence, moonshine, and childishness. If you do\r\nnot wish to be roughly awakened, go and dream at a distance from Vienna;\r\nfor here there are certainly some people who will think it their duty to\r\ndisturb you!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you not warn me, Kaunitz?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not wish to have the appearance of forcing myself into your\r\nmajesty's confidence. I had not been intrusted with your secret, and had\r\nno right to warn you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you warned the empress instead,\" said Joseph, bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"I warned nobody, your majesty. I said to myself, 'He is an enviable man\r\nto be able, in the midst of an artificial life, to enjoy the sweets of\r\nrural intercourse.' I foresaw what must inevitably happen; and pitied\r\nthe innocent Eve, who will, ere long, be exiled from paradise.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is exiled!\" cried the emperor. \"She has been removed, I know not\r\nwhere. She has disappeared, and no trace of her can I find.\"\r\n\r\n\"Disappeared!\" exclaimed Kaunitz, astonished. \"Then I have not heard the\r\nwhole truth. I did not even know that she was to be removed; I only\r\nsuspected it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me the truth!\" cried the emperor, sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" said Kaunitz, proudly, \"there may be times when it is the part\r\nof wisdom to be silent; but it is never permitted to a man of honor to\r\nbe untruthful. I know nothing of this girl's disappearance. The most\r\nthat I anticipated was a forced marriage. This, I knew, would occasion\r\nnew differences between the empress and your majesty, and I had supposed\r\nthat you were coming to me to call for my mediation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must believe you,\" sighed the emperor. \"But prove your integrity by\r\nhelping me to find her. Oh, Kaunitz, I beseech of you, help me, and earn\r\nthereby my gratitude and undying regard!\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I waited so long for your majesty's regard, to earn it on account\r\nof a silly peasant?\" said Kaunitz, with a bitter smile. \"I hope that I\r\nshall have a niche in the temple of the world's esteem, even if I do\r\nfail in finding the daughter of Conrad the boor. If your majesty has\r\nnever esteemed me before, you will not begin to do so today; and, as\r\nregards your promised gratitude; the whole world knows, and your majesty\r\nalso knows, that I am not to be bribed; but I am ready, from the depths\r\nof my own attachment to you, to do all that I can to help you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kaunitz,\" said the emperor, offering him his hand, \"you intend to force\r\nme to love you.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I ever did force your majesty to love me,\" replied Kaunitz, with\r\nanimation, \"I should count it the happiest day of my life. If I ever\r\nsucceed in winning your confidence, then I may hope to complete the work\r\nI have begun--that of uniting your majesty's dominions into one great\r\nwhole, before which all Europe shall bow in reverence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us speak of other things,\" interrupted the emperor. \"Help me to\r\nfind Marianne.\"\r\n\r\n\"Allow me one question, then--am I the only person to whom your majesty\r\nhas spoken on this subject?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I have spoken to one other man. I have consulted the shrewdest\r\ndetective in all Vienna, and have promised him a large reward if he will\r\nserve me. He came to me this morning. He had discovered nothing, but\r\ngave me to understand that it was you who had betrayed me to the\r\nempress.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is his name, your majesty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eberhard. He has sworn to unravel the mystery for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it certainly will be unravelled, for he it is who has been\r\ntracking your majesty, and who has been the means of betraying you to\r\nthe empress. I, too, have been giving him gold, with this difference,\r\nthat your majesty trusted him, and I did not. He is at the bottom of the\r\nwhole plot.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor sprang from his seat, and hastened to the door. Kaunitz\r\nfollowed, and ventured to detain him.\r\n\r\n\"I must go,\" cried Joseph, impatiently. \"I must force Eberhard to tell\r\nme what has been done with Marianne.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will not find him. He, too, has disappeared.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I must go to the empress to beg her to be merciful to that poor\r\nchild who is suffering on my account. I will exact it of her.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will only make the matter worse.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph stamped his foot, and uttered a cry of fury. \"What must I do,\r\nthen?\" exclaimed he.\r\n\r\n\"Be silent and affect indifference. As soon as the empress believes that\r\nyou have grown careless on the girl's account, she will begin to think\r\nthat she has taken the matter too seriously to heart. Conrad must sell\r\nhis farm, and remove far away from Vienna. Once settled, let him come\r\nand claim his daughter, and the empress will be very glad to be rid of\r\nher. Do this, and all will be right.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph frowned, and seemed reluctant to follow this advice.\r\n\r\nKaunitz saw his unwillingness, and continued \"This is the only means of\r\nrestoring the girl to peace of mind, and your majesty owes her this\r\nreparation. The poor thing has been rudely precipitated from the clouds;\r\nand as the comedy is over, the best thing we can do for her is to\r\nconvince her that it as a comedy, and that the curtain has fallen. Your\r\nmajesty, however, must not again lay your imperial hand upon the simple\r\nweb of her destiny: leave it to your inferiors to gather up its broken\r\nthreads. Go away from Vienna; travel, and seek recreation. Leave\r\nMarianne to me, and I swear to you that I will rescue and befriend her.\r\nWhen you have gone, I shall go to the empress and relate the whole\r\nstory. I shall tell all the truth; Maria Theresa has a noble, generous\r\nheart; and she will not do any injury to the one who was instrumental in\r\nsaving the life of her darling son. She will do any thing for her\r\nhappiness, provided it do not compromise the honor of her imperial\r\nhouse. And she is right. But you must go, and once gone, Marianne shall\r\nbe free.\"\r\n\r\n\"Free not only from others, but from me also,\" said the emperor, deeply\r\naffected. \"I feel I have erred toward this innocent young girl. I have\r\ndeeply sinned; for, regardless of her peace of mind, I have allowed\r\nmyself to dream of a love that could bring naught and misery to both.\r\nFor I will not conceal from you, my friend, how much it costs me to\r\nrenounce this sweet creature, and to promise that I will see her no\r\nmore. My intercourse with her was the last dying sigh of a love which\r\nhas gone from my heart forevermore. But--it must be sacrificed. Rescue\r\nher, and try to make her happy, Kaunitz; try to efface from her heart\r\nthe memory of my blasting love.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise to free her, but I cannot promise to rescue her from the\r\nmemory of your majesty's love. Who knows that from the ring which she\r\nhas sworn to wear forever, she may not have inhaled a poison that will\r\nshorten her young life? To rescue her from such a fate lies not in the\r\npower of man. Time--the great comforter--may heal her wounds, but your\r\nmajesty must promise never to ask whither she has gone. For you she must\r\nbe dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise, on my imperial honor, never to see her again,\" said Joseph,\r\nin a faltering voice. \"I will leave to-morrow. Thank God, the world is\r\nwide; and, far away from Vienna, I, too, can seek for oblivion, and,\r\nperchance, for another ray of earthly happiness.\" And so ended the\r\npastoral of the emperor and the village maid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nCOUNT FALKENSTEIN.\r\n\r\n\"Away with care and sorrow! Away with royalty and state!\" cried the\r\nemperor, as the long train of wagons, which had accompanied him from\r\nVienna, were disappearing in the distance.\r\n\r\nThe empress had caused preparation for her son's journey to be made with\r\nimperial pomp. A brilliant cortege of nobles and gentleman had followed\r\nthe emperor's caleche, and behind them came twelve wagons with beds,\r\ncooking utensils, and provisions--the whole gotten up with true princely\r\nmagnificence.\r\n\r\nThe emperor had said nothing, and had left Vienna amid the chiming of\r\nbells and the loud greetings of the people. For two days he submitted to\r\nthe tedious pageants of public receptions, stupid addresses, girls in\r\nwhite, and flower-decked arches; but on the morning of the third day,\r\ntwo couriers announced not only to the discomfited gentlemen composing\r\nhis suite, but to the conductors of the provision-train, that the\r\nemperor would excuse them from further attendance.\r\n\r\nEverybody was astonished, and everybody was disappointed. The emperor,\r\nmeanwhile, stood by laughing, until the last wagon was out of sight.\r\n\r\n\"Away with sorrow and care!\" cried he, approaching his two carriage\r\ncompanions, Counts Rosenberg and Coronini. \"Note, any friends,\"\r\nexclaimed he, putting a hand upon the shoulder of each one, \"now the\r\nworld is ours! Let us enjoy our rich inheritance! But--bless me, how\r\nforlorn you both look! What is the matter? have I been mistaken in\r\nsupposing you would relish my plan of travel?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty,\" replied Rosenberg, with a forced smile, \"but I am\r\nafraid you will scarcely relish it yourself. You have parted with every\r\nconvenience that snakes travelling endurable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty will have to put up with many a sorry dinner and many an\r\nuncomfortable bed,\" sighed Comnini.\r\n\r\n\"I am tired of comforts and conveniences,\" rejoined the emperor,\r\nlaughing, \"and I long for the variety of privation. But, in my\r\nthoughtlessness, I had taken it for granted that you, too, were weary of\r\ngrandeur, and would like to get a taste of ordinary life. If I am\r\nmistaken, you are free to return with my discharged cortege; I force no\r\none to share my hardships. Speak quickly, for there is yet time for me\r\nto select other fellow-travellers.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, your majesty,\" said Rosenberg gayly, \"I will go whither you go,\r\nand share your privations!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here I stay, to live and die at your majesty's side!\" cried Coronini,\r\nwith comic fervor.\r\n\r\nThe emperor nodded. \"Thank you both, my friends; I had counted upon you,\r\nand would have regretted your refusal to go with me. Thank Heaven, we\r\nare no longer under the necessity of parading our rank about the world!\r\nI cannot express to you the joy I feel at the prospect of going about\r\nunnoticed, like any other man.\"\r\n\r\n\"That joy will be denied your majesty,\" said Rosenberg, with a slight\r\ninclination. \"The Emperor Joseph can never go unnoticed, like ordinary\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not hope it, your majesty!\" cried Coronini. \"Your majesty's rank is\r\nstamped upon your brow, and you cannot hide it.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor looked down on the sandy hillock on which they stood, then\r\nupward at the bright-blue sky above their heads.\r\n\r\n\"Are we then under the gilded dome of my mother's palace,\" sail he,\r\nafter a pause, \"that I should still hear the language of courtly\r\nfalsehood? Awake, my friends, for this is not Austria's imperial\r\ncapital! It is the world which God created, and here upon our mother\r\nearth we stand as man to mail. A little shining beetle is creeping on my\r\nboot as familiarly as it would on the sabot of a base-born laborer. If\r\nmy divine right were written upon my brow, would not the insects\r\nacknowledge my sovereignty, as in Eden they its golden wings and leave\r\nme without a sign--Happy beetle! Would that I too had wings, that I\r\nmight flee away and be at rest!\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor heaved a sigh, and his thoughts evidently wandered faraway\r\nfrom the scene before him. But presently recalling himself, he spoke\r\nagain. Pointing to the sky, he said:\r\n\r\n\"And now, friends, look above you where the heavens enthrone a Jehovah,\r\nin whose sight all men are equal: and so long as we dwell together under\r\nthe open sky, remember him who has said, 'Thou shalt have no other gods\r\nbefore me!\"'\r\n\r\n\"But, your majesty--\"\r\n\r\n\"Majesty! Where is any majesty here? If I were a lion, to shake the\r\nforest with my roar I might pretend to majesty among the brutes; but you\r\nsee that I am, in all things, like yourself--neither nobler nor greater\r\nthan you. In Vienna I am your sovereign: so be it; but while we travel,\r\nI am simply Count Falkenstein. I beg you to respect this name and title,\r\nfor the Falkensteins are an older race of nobles than the Hapsburgs, and\r\nthe turreted castle of my ancestors, the counts, is one of the oldest in\r\nGermany. Away, then, with royalty! I ask for admittance into your own\r\nrank. Will you accept me, and promise that we shall be on terms of\r\nequality?\"\r\n\r\nHe offered a hand to each of his friends, and would not permit them to\r\ndo otherwise than press it, in token of assent.\r\n\r\n\"Now let me tell you my plans. We travel like three happy fellows, bent\r\nupon recreation alone. We go and stay as it best suits us; when we are\r\nhungry, we will dine; when we are tired, we will sleep. A little straw\r\nwill make our beds, and our cloaks shall keep us warm. [Footnote: The\r\nemperor, during his tour as Count Falkenstein, repeatedly slept on\r\nstraw, over which a leathern cover was spread. Hubner, i., p. 43.] In\r\nFlorence I shall be forced to play the emperor, as the reigning duke is\r\nmy brother; but he, too, will join us, and then we shall all go on\r\ntravelling incognito. First we visit Rome, then Naples. We must find out\r\nwhether our sister Caroline has taught her lazzaroni-king to read and\r\nwrite; and when we shall have learned something of her domestic life, we\r\nwill turn our faces homeward. In Milan I roust again play the emperor,\r\nfor Lombardy needs my protection, and I must give it. From Lombardy I\r\nreturn to Vienna. Does the route please you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exceedingly, count,\" replied Rosenberg.\r\n\r\n\"It does, indeed, your highness,\" added Coronini.\r\n\r\n\"And why, my highness?\" asked Joseph, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Because the Counts of Falkenstein were princes, and the title being\r\nappropriate, I hope your majesty will allow me to use it.\" \"I regret\r\nvery much, most worthy master-of-ceremonies-itinerant, that I cannot do\r\nso. Pack up your court-manners, Coronini, and carry them in your trunk\r\nuntil we get back to Vienna. \"\r\n\r\n\"So be it, then,\" sighed Coronini, \"since your m--, I mean my lord count,\r\nwill have it so, we must be content to have you hidden under a cloud,\r\nlike Jupiter, when he made acquaintance with Io.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jupiter, Coronini, you are ambitious in your similes,\" replied the\r\nemperor, laughing. \"You look very much like Io, do you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope we may be as lucky as the gods,\" interrupted Rosenberg, \"for\r\nevery time they visited the earth they were sure to fall in with all the\r\npretty women.\"\r\n\r\n\"True; but mythology teaches that the women who aspired to love gods,\r\nforfeited both happiness and life,\" replied the emperor, with a touch of\r\nsadness in his voice. \"But pshaw!\" continued he, suddenly, \"what do I\r\nsay? Away with retrospection! Let us come out of the clouds, and\r\napproach, both of you, while I intrust you with a great secret--I am\r\nhungry. \"\r\n\r\nThe two counts started in breathless haste for the carriage, near which\r\nthe emperor's valet and the postilion were in earnest conversation; but\r\nthey returned with very long faces.\r\n\r\n\"Count,\" said Rosenberg, sadly, \"we have nothing to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"The valet says that Count Falkentstein ordered every thing to be sent\r\nback to Vienna except our trunks,\" sighed Coronini. \"All the wine,\r\nbread, game, and delicacies remained in the wagons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" cried the emperor, laughing heartily at the contretemps,\r\n\"let us go and ask for dinner in yonder village behind the wood.\"\r\n\r\n\"The postilion says that there is not a public house anywhere about,\"\r\ncontinued Coronini, in great distress. \"He says that we will find\r\nnothing to eat in the village.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of making a reply, the emperor walked to the hillock, and\r\nquestioned the postilion himself.\r\n\r\n\"What is the name of the village beyond the forest?\" asked he.\r\n\r\n\"Wichern, your majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do we change horses there?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty, we harness up at Unterbergen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can we get any breakfast at Wichern, think you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, your majesty, not a morsel of any thing--none but peasants live\r\nin the village.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my friend, do the peasants live without eating?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, your majesty, they eat anything! They live on bread, bacon, eggs,\r\nand milk, with sometimes a mess of cabbage or beans.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you call that having nothing to eat?\" exclaimed Joseph, hastening\r\njoyfully back to his friends. \"Come, come; we shall find dinner at\r\nWichern, and if nobody will cook for us, we will cook for ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nCoronini opened his eyes like full moons.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you stare so, Coronini? Are not all soldiers cooks? I, at least,\r\nam resolved to learn, and I feel beforehand that I shall do honor to\r\nmyself. Cook and butler, I shall fill both offices. Come, we are going\r\nto enjoy ourselves. Thomas, tell the postilion to drive as far as the\r\nentrance of the village. We will forage on foot.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor bounded into the carriage, the two noblemen followed, the\r\npostilion cracked his whip, and they were soon at Wichern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nWHAT THEY FOUND AT WICHERN.\r\n\r\nThe carriage stopped, and before the valet had had time to open the\r\ndoor, the emperor leaped to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said he, merrily, \"come and seek your fortunes. Thomas, you\r\nremain with the carriage. Drive under the shade of that tree and wait\r\nfor our return. Before all things, I forbid you to tell anybody who we\r\nare. From this day forward, my name is Count Falkenstein. Mark me! I\r\nexpect you to preserve my incognito.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will obey you, my lord count,\" said the valet, with a bow.\r\n\r\nThe emperor with his two companions walked toward the village. Nothing\r\nvery hopeful was to be seen as they looked up the dirty little streets.\r\nThe wretched mud cottages stood each one apart, their yards separated by\r\nscraggy willow-hedges, upon which ragged old garments were hanging in\r\nthe sun to dry. Between the hedges were muddy pools, over which the\r\nducks were wrangling for the bits of weed that floated on the surface of\r\nthe foul waters. On their borders, in the very midst of the rubbish and\r\nkitchen offal that lay about in heaps, dirty, half-naked children, with\r\nstraw-colored hair, tumbled over one another, or paddled in the water.\r\nIn the farm-yards around the dung-heaps, the youngest children of the\r\ncottagers kept company with the sow and her grunting pigs. Before the\r\nslovenly entrances of the huts here and there sat dirty, unseemly old\r\nmen and women, who stared at the three strangers as they surveyed the\r\nuninviting picture before them.\r\n\r\n\"I congratulate the emperor that he is not obliged to look upon this\r\nshocking scene,\" said Joseph. \"I am glad that his people cannot cry out\r\nto him for help, since help for such squalor as this there is none on\r\nearth.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are not as wretched as you suppose,\" said Rosenberg. \"These people\r\nare scarcely above the brute creation; and they know of nothing better\r\nthan the existence which is so shocking to you. They were born and bred\r\nin squalor, and provided their pastures yield forage, their hens lay\r\neggs and their cows give milk, they live and die contented.\"\r\n\r\n\"If so, they are an enviable set of mortals,\" replied Joseph, laughing,\r\n\"and we, who require so much for our comfort, are poorer than they. But\r\nas there is no help for our poverty, let us think of dinner. Here are\r\nthree streets; the village seems to have been divided for our especial\r\naccommodation. Each one shall take a street, and in one hour from now we\r\nmeet at the carriage, each man with a dish of contribution. En avant! I\r\ntake the street before me; you do the same. Look at your watches, and be\r\npunctual.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he waved his hand and hastened forward. The same solitude and\r\nmisery met his view as he walked on; the same ducks, hens, sows, and\r\ntumbling children; with now and then the shrill treble of a scolding\r\nwoman, or the melancholy lowing of a sick cow.\r\n\r\n\"I am curious now,\" thought the emperor, \"to know how and where I am to\r\nfind my dinner. But stay--here is a cottage less slovenly than its\r\nneighbors; I shall tempt my fortunes there.\"\r\n\r\nHe opened the wicker gate and entered the yard. The lazy sow that lay on\r\nthe dunghill grunted, but took no further notice of the imperial\r\nintruder. He stopped before the low cottage door and knocked, but no one\r\ncame. The place seemed silent and deserted; not the faintest hum of life\r\nwas to be heard from within.\r\n\r\n\"I shall take the liberty of going in without awaiting an invitation,\"\r\nsaid the emperor, pushing open the door and entering the cottage. But he\r\nstarted at the unexpected sight that met his view as he looked around\r\nthe room. It was a miserable place, cold and bare; not a chair or any\r\nother article of household furniture was to be seen; but in the centre\r\nof the room stood a small deal coffin, and in the coffin was the corpse\r\nof a child. Stiff and cold, beautiful and tranquil, lay the babe, a\r\nsmile still lingering around its mouth, while its half-open eyes seemed\r\nfixed upon the white roses that were clasped in its little dimpled\r\nhands. The coffin lay in the midst of flowers, and within slept the dead\r\nchild, transfigured and glorified.\r\n\r\nThe emperor advanced softly and bent over it. He looked with tender\r\nsympathy at the little marble image which yesterday was a poor, ragged\r\npeasant, to-day was a bright and winged angel. His thoughts flew back to\r\nthe imperial palace, where his little motherless daughter was fading\r\naway from earth, and the father prayed for his only child. He took from\r\nthe passive hands a rose, and softly as he came, he left the solitary\r\ncottage, wherein an angel was keeping watch.\r\n\r\nHe passed over to the neighboring yard. Here too, everything seemed to\r\nbe at rest: but a savory odor saluted the nostrils of the noble\r\nadventurer which at least betokened the presence of beings who hungered\r\nand thirsted, and had some regard for the creature comforts of life.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said the emperor, drawing in the fragrant smell, \"that savors of\r\nmeat and greens,\" and he hurried through the house to the kitchen. Sure\r\nenough, there blazed a roaring fire, and from the chimney-crane hung the\r\nsteaming pot whence issued the delightful aroma of budding dinner. On\r\nthe hearth stood a young woman of cleanly appearance, who was stirring\r\nthe contents of the pot with a great wooden spoon.\r\n\r\n\"Good-morning, madame,\" said the emperor, in a loud, cheerful voice. The\r\nwoman started, gave a scream, and turned her glowing face to the door.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by coming into strange people's houses and frightening\r\nthem so?\" cried she, angrily. \"Nobody asked you in, I am sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, madame,\" said the emperor. \"I was urgently invited.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like to know who invited you, for nobody is here but myself,\r\nand I don't want you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madame; but your steaming kettle, I do assure you, has given me a\r\npressing invitation to dine here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! you are witty, are you? Well, carry your wits elsewhere; they won't\r\nserve you here. My kettle calls nobody but those who are to eat of my\r\ndinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the very thing I want, madame. I want to eat of your dinner.\"\r\nAs he spoke, the emperor kept advancing until he came close upon the\r\nkettle and its tempting contents; but the peasant-woman pushed him\r\nrudely back, and thrusting her broad person between himself and the\r\ncoveted pot, she looked defiance at him, and broke out into a torrent of\r\nabuse.\r\n\r\nThe emperor laughed aloud. \"I don't wish to rob you,\" said he. \"I will\r\npay you handsomely if you will only let me have your dinner. What have\r\nyou in that pot?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is none of your business. With my bacon and beans you have no\r\nconcern.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bacon and beans! Oh, my craving stomach! Here, take this piece of gold\r\nand give the some directly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you take me for a fool, to sell my dinner just as the men will be\r\ncoming from the field!\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means for a fool,\" said the emperor, soothingly; \"but if you show\r\nthe men that golden ducat they will wait patiently until you cook them\r\nanother dinner. Your husband can buy himself a fine holiday suit with\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has one, and don't want two. Go your way; you shall not have a\r\nmorsel of my dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if I give you two gold pieces? Come, do be accommodating, and give\r\nme the bacon and beans.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you yon shall not have them,\" screamed the termagant. \"I have no\r\nuse for your gold, but I want my dinner. So be off with you. You will\r\nget nothing from me if you beg all day long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, madame; I bid you good-morning,\" said Joseph, laughing, but\r\ninwardly chagrined at his fiasco. \"I must go on, however,\" thought he;\r\nand he entered the yard of the next house. Before the door sat a pale\r\nyoung woman, with a new-born infant in her arms. She looked up with a\r\nlanguid smile.\r\n\r\n\"I am hungry,\" said Joseph, after greeting her with uncovered head.\r\n\"Have you any thing good in your kitchen?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head sadly. \"I am a poor, weak creature, sir, and cannot\r\nget a meal for my husband,\" replied she; \"he will have to cook his own\r\ndinner when he comes home.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what will he cook to-day, for instance?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose he will make an omelet; for the hens have been cackling a\r\ngreat deal this morning, and an omelet is made in a few minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it? So much the better, then; you can show me how to make one, and I\r\nwill pay you well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go in the hen-coop, sir, and see if you find any eggs. My husband will\r\nwant three of them; the rest are at your service.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is the hen-coop?\" asked Joseph, much pleased.\r\n\r\n\"Go through the kitchen out into the yard, and you will see a little\r\nroom with a wooden bolt; that is the hen-coop.\"\r\n\r\n\"I go,\" cried Joseph merrily. Presently great commotion was heard among\r\nthe hens, and the emperor returned with a glowing face, his hair and\r\ncoat well sprinkled with straw. He came forward with both hands full of\r\neggs.\r\n\r\n\"Here are eight,\" said he. \"Three for your husband, and five for me. Now\r\ntell me how I must cook them.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will have to go to the kitchen, sir. There you will find a flitch\r\nof bacon. Cut off some slices, put them in a pan you will see there, and\r\nset it on the fire. My neighbor has just now made some for poor John.\r\nThen look on the dresser and take some milk and a little flour. Make a\r\nbatter of them with the eggs, pour it upon your bacon, and when the eggs\r\nare done, the omelet is made. It is the easiest thing in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear good woman, it will be a desperately hard task for me,\" said\r\nthe emperor with a sigh. \"I'm afraid I shall make a very poor omelet.\r\nWon't you come into the kitchen and make it for me? Do, I will pay you\r\nwell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear gentleman,\" said the young woman, blushing \"do you think I am so\r\nidle as to sit here, if I could get up and help you? I was brought to\r\nbed yesterday of this baby; and I am such a poor, sickly thing that I\r\nshall not be able to get up before two days. As the day was bright, dear\r\nJohn brought me and the baby out here, because it was more cheerful on\r\nthe door-sill than within. I am a weak, useless creature, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Weak! useless!\" cried the emperor, astounded; \"and you expect to be up\r\nin three days after your confinement? Poor little thing! Have you no\r\nphysician and no medicine?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Lord is my physician, sir,\" said the simple creature, \"and my\r\nmedicine is the fresh air. But let me think of your omelet. If you\r\ncannot make it yourself, just step to the cottage on the left, and call\r\nmy neighbor. She is very good to me, and she will make your omelet for\r\nyou with pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"A thousand thanks,\" said the emperor, hastening to follow the\r\ndirections. He, returned in a few moments with a good-humored, healthy\r\nyoung woman, who went cheerfully to work, and the omelet was soon made.\r\n\r\nOne hour after he had parted from his friends, the emperor was seen\r\ncoming along the street with a platter in his hand and a little bucket\r\non his arm. He walked carefully, his eyes fixed upon his precious dish,\r\nall anxiety lest it should fall from his hands.\r\n\r\nThomas was thunderstruck. An emperor carrying an earthen platter in his\r\nhand! He darted forward to receive it, but Joseph motioned him away.\r\n\r\n\"Don't touch me, Thomas,\" said he, \"or I shall let it fall. I intend to\r\nplace it with my own hands. Go, now, and set the table. Pile up some of\r\nthose flat stones, and bring the carriage cushions. We will dine under\r\nthat wide-spreading oak. Make haste, I am very hungry.\"\r\n\r\nOff went Thomas, obedient, though bewildered; and he had soon improvised\r\na, table, over which he laid a shining damask cloth. Luckily, the\r\nemperor's camp-chest had not been put in the baggage-wagon, or his\r\nmajesty would have had to eat with his fingers. But the golden service\r\nwas soon forthcoming, with goblets of sparkling crystal, and three\r\nbottles of fine old Hungarian wine.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Joseph triumphantly, \"let me place my dishes.\" With these\r\nwords he put on his platter and basket, with great ceremony and\r\nundisguised satisfaction.\r\n\r\nA curious medley of wealth and poverty were these golden plates and\r\nforks, with the coarse red platter, that contained the hard-earned\r\nomelet. But the omelet was smoking and savory, and the strawberries were\r\nsplendid.\r\n\r\nWhile the emperor was enjoying the result of his foraging expedition,\r\nRosenberg and Coronini were seen approaching, each with his earthen\r\nplatter in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"The hour is up and we are here,\" said Coronini. \"I have the honor of\r\nlaying my dish at your m--feet, count.\"\r\n\r\n\"Potatoes! beautiful roasted potatoes!\" cried Joseph. \"Why, count, you\r\nhave brought us a treat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I rejoice to hear it, my lord count; for I was threatened with a\r\nbroomstick when I tore it from the hands of the woman, who vowed I\r\nshould not have a single potato. I dashed two ducats at her feet and\r\nmade off with all speed; for the hour was almost up, and I had exhausted\r\nall my manners in the ten houses, which I had visited in vain, before my\r\nsuccessful raid upon hers.\"\r\n\r\n\"And will not my lord count cast an eye upon my dish?\" asked Rosenberg.\r\n\r\n\"He has obtained that for which I sued in vain!\" cried Joseph. \"He has\r\nactually brought bacon and beans.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I did not sue; I stormed and threatened. Neither did I waste my\r\ngold to obtain my end. I threw the woman a silver thaler and plenty of\r\nabuse in the bargain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us be seated!\" said the emperor, \"and pray admire my omelet and my\r\nstrawberries. Now, Coronini, the strawberries are tempting, but before\r\nyou taste them, I must tell you that they are tainted with treason:\r\ntreason toward my own sacred person. Reflect well before you decide to\r\neat them. What I am going to relate is as terrible as it is true. While\r\nmy omelet was cooking, I strolled out into the road to see if there was\r\nany thing else in Wichern besides poultry, pigs, and dirty children.\r\nComing toward me I perceived a pretty little barefoot boy, with a basket\r\nfull of red, luscious strawberries. I asked where he was going. He said\r\nto the neighboring village to sell his strawberries to the farmer's\r\nwife, who had ordered them. I offered to buy them, but my gold could not\r\ntempt the child--he refused peremptorily to sell them to me at any\r\nprice. I argued, pleaded, threatened; all to no purpose. At length,\r\nseeing there was no other alternative, I snatched his strawberries away,\r\nthrew him a ducat, and walked off with the prize. He picked up the gold,\r\nbut as he did so, he saluted my imperial ears with an epithet--such an\r\nepithet! Oh, you will shudder when you hear what language the little\r\nrascal used to his sovereign! You never will be able to bear it,\r\nCoronini: you, whose loyalty is offended every time you address me as\r\nCount Falkenstein. I only wonder that the sun did not hide its head, and\r\nthe earth tremble at the sacrilege! What do you suppose he called\r\nme?--An ass! He did, I assure you. That little bare-legged boy called\r\nhis emperor an ass! Now, Coronini, do you think you can taste of the\r\nstrawberries that were gathered by those treacherous little hands?\"\r\n\r\n\"If my lord count allows it, I will venture to eat,\" replied Coronini,\r\n\"for I really think there was no treason committed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why! not when he called me an--\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray do not say it again,\" entreated Coronini, raising his hands\r\ndeprecatingly; \"it cuts me to the heart. But Count Falkenstein had\r\nalready proclaimed that no majesty was by, and when no majesty, was\r\nthere, no majesty could be insulted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you sophist! Did you not say that I wore my title upon my brow? Did\r\nyou not tell me that I could not hide my majesty from the sons of men?\r\nBut I forgive you, and the boy also. Let us drink his health while we\r\nenjoy his strawberries. Fill your glasses to the brim, and having done\r\nhonor to those who furnished our repast, allow me to propose--ourselves:\r\nTo the health of those who are about to eat a dinner which they have\r\nearned by the sweat of their brow.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the emperor touched the glasses of his friends.\r\n\r\n\"Now, postilion,\" cried he, before they drank, \"blow us a blast on your\r\nhorn--a right merry blast!\"\r\n\r\nThe postilion put the horn to his lips, and while he blew the glasses\r\nclinked gayly; and the friends laughed, jested, and ate their dinner\r\nwith a relish they had seldom known before. [Footnote: Hubner, \"Life of\r\nJoseph II.,\" vol. i., page 40.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\nTHE SOMNAMBULIST.\r\n\r\nThe policy instituted by Kaunitz, when he became sole minister of the\r\nempress, had now culminated in the alliance of Austria with France,\r\nthrough the solemn betrothal of the childish Marie Antoinette with the\r\ndauphin. The union was complete--it was to be cemented by the strong tie\r\nof intermarriage; and now, that success had crowned the schemes to which\r\nshe had yielded such hearty consent, Maria Theresa was anxious,\r\nrestless, and unhappy. Vainly she strove to thrust from her memory the\r\nprophecy which had been foretold in relation to the destinies of France.\r\nWith anguish she remembered the cry of Marie Antoinette; with horror she\r\nrecurred to the vision which had overcome Catherine de Medicis.\r\n\r\n\"It is sinful in me,\" thought the empress, as one morning she left her\r\npillow from inability to sleep. \"God alone is Lord of futurity, and no\r\nhuman hand dare lift its black curtain! But stay,\" cried she, suddenly\r\nspringing up, and in her eager haste beginning to dress without\r\nassistance. \"There is in Vienna a holy nun, who is said to be a\r\nprophetess, and Father Gassner, to whom I have extended protection, he,\r\ntoo, is said at times to enjoy the privilege of God's prophets of old.\r\nPerhaps they have been sent in mercy to warn us, lest, in our ignorance\r\nof consequences, we stumble and sin.\"\r\n\r\nFor some time the empress walked up and down her room, undecided whether\r\nto turn the sibylline leaves or not. It might be sinful to question, it\r\nmight be fatal to remain ignorant. Was it, or was it not the will of\r\nGod, that she should pry into the great mystery of futurity? Surely it\r\ncould not be sinful, else why should He have given to His servants the\r\ngift of prophecy?\r\n\r\n\"I will go to the Ursuline nun,\" concluded she, \"and Father Gassner\r\nshall come to me.\"\r\n\r\nShe rang, and ordered a carriage, with no attendant but her first lady\r\nof honor. \"No footman, no outriders, but a simple court equipage; and\r\ninform Father Gassner that in one hour I shall await him in the palace.\"\r\n\r\nIn less than half an hour the carriage of the empress was at the gate of\r\nthe Ursuline Convent. Completely disguised in a long black cloak, with\r\nher face hidden under a thick veil, Maria Theresa leaped eagerly to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nHer attendant was about to follow, but the empress motioned her to\r\nremain. \"Await me here,\" said she, \"I do not wish to be known in the\r\nconvent. I am about to imitate my son, and visit my subjects incognito.\"\r\n\r\nThe porteress, who had recognized the imperial liveries, made no\r\nopposition to the entrance of the tall, veiled figure. She supposed her\r\nto be some lady of the empress's household, and allowed her to pass at\r\nonce into the hall, following her steps with undisguised curiosity.\r\n\r\nShe had already ascended the staircase, when she turned to the\r\nporteress.\r\n\r\n\"In which cell is the invalid nun?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"Your highness means Sister Margaret, the somnambulist?\" asked the\r\nporteress. \"She has been taken to the parlor of the abbess, for the\r\nconvenience of the many who visit her now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does she pretend to reveal the future?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would make your highness's hair stand on end to hear her! She has\r\nbeen asleep this morning, and do you know what she said in her sleep.\r\nShe prophesied that the convent would be honored by a visit from the\r\nempress on this very day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she, indeed?\" faltered Maria Theresa. \"When? How long ago?\"\r\n\r\n\"About two hours ago, your highness. And as she is never mistaken, the\r\nabbess has prepared all things for her majesty's reception. Doubtless\r\nyour ladyship has been sent to announce her?\"\r\n\r\n\"You really feel sure that she will come?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. Sister Margaret's visions are prophetic--we cannot doubt\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress shuddered, and drew her cloak close around her. \"Gracious\r\nHeaven!\" thought she, \"what if she should prophesy evil for my\r\nchild?--It is well,\" added she, aloud; \"where shall I find her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your highness has only to turn to the left; the last door leads into\r\nthe parlor of the abbess.\"\r\n\r\nA deep silence reigned throughout the convent. The empress went on\r\nthrough the dim, long corridor, now with hurried step and wildly-beating\r\nheart, now suddenly pausing faint and irresolute, to lean against a\r\npillar, and gather courage for the interview. As she turned the corner\r\nof the corridor, a flood of light, streaming through an oriel window,\r\nrevived and cheered her. She stepped forward and looked. The window\r\nopened upon the chapel, where the lights were burning upon the altar,\r\nand high mass was about to begin; for Sister Margaret had said that the\r\nempress was very near.\r\n\r\n\"It is true. They are waiting for me. Oh, she must be a prophetess, for,\r\ntwo hours ago, I had not dreamed of coming hither! I feel my courage\r\nfail me. I will go back. I dare not hear, for it is too late.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress turned and retraced her steps; then once more calling up all\r\nher fortitude, she returned. \"For,\" thought she, \"if God permits me to\r\nsee, why should I remain blind? He it is who has sent me to this holy\r\nprophetess. I must listen for my Antoinette's sake.\"\r\n\r\nA second time she went forward, reached the parlor, and opened the door.\r\nShe had scarcely appeared on the threshold, cloaked and screened by her\r\nthick black veil, when a clear voice, whose tones were preterhuman in\r\ntheir melody, addressed her. \"Hail, Empress of Austria! All hail to her\r\nwho cometh hither!\"\r\n\r\n\"She is indeed a prophetess!\" murmured the empress. \"She knows me\r\nthrough my disguise.\"\r\n\r\nShe approached the bed and bent over it. The nun lay with closed eyes;\r\nbut a heavenly smile was upon her lips, and a holy light seemed to play\r\naround her pale but beautiful face. Not the least tinge of color was on\r\nher cheeks; and but for the tint of carmine upon her lips--so unearthly,\r\nso seraphic was her beauty--that she might have been mistaken for a\r\nsculptor's dream of Azrael, the pale angel of death.\r\n\r\nWhile the empress gazed awe-stricken, the abbess and the nuns, who had\r\nbeen kneeling around the bed, arose to greet their sovereign.\r\n\r\n\"Is it indeed our gracious empress?\" asked the abbess.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa withdrew her hat and veil, and revealed her pale, agitated\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"I am the empress,\" said she,, \"But I implore you let there be no\r\nceremony because of my visit. In this sacred habitation, God alone is\r\ngreat, and His creatures are all equal before Him. We are in the\r\npresence of the servant to whom He has condescended to speak, while to\r\nthe sovereigns of earth He is silent. To Him alone belongs homage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gracious empress, Sister Margaret had announced your majesty's visit,\r\nand we were to have greeted you as becomes Christian subjects. The\r\nchapel is prepared, the altar is decked.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will repair later to the church, mother. At present, my visit is to\r\nSister Margaret.\"\r\n\r\n\"If so, your majesty must not delay. She sleeps but three hours at a\r\ntime, and she will soon awake. She has the gift of prophecy in her sleep\r\nonly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then go, holy mother, and leave me alone with her. Go and await me in\r\nthe church.\"\r\n\r\nThe abbess glanced at the clock on the wall. \"She will awake in ten\r\nminutes,\" said she, and with noiseless steps the nuns all left the room.\r\n\r\nThe empress waited until the door was closed and the sound of their\r\nlight footfall had died away; then again approaching the bed, she\r\ncalled, \"Sister Margaret.\"\r\n\r\nThe nun trembled, and her brow grew troubled. \"Oh,\" said she, \"the\r\nangels have flown! Why have you come with your sad notes of sorrow to\r\nsilence the harmony of my heavenly dreams?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know then that I am sad?\" asked the empress.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your heart is open to me. I see your anguish. The mother comes to\r\nme, not the empress.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa feeling herself in the presence of a supernatural being,\r\nglided down upon her knees. \"You are right,\" said she, \"it is indeed a\r\nsorrowing mother who kneels before you, imploring you, in the humility\r\nof my heart, to say what God hath revealed of her daughter s fate!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" cried the nun, in a voice of anguish.\r\n\r\nBut the empress went on. \"My soul trembles for Marie Antoinette.\r\nSomething seems to warn me not to trust my child to the foul atmosphere\r\nof that court of France, where Du Barry sits by the side of the king,\r\nand the nobles pay her homage as though she were a virtuous queen. Oh!\r\ntell me, holy sister, what will become of my Antoinette in France?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! oh!\" wailed the nun, and she writhed upon her bed.\r\n\r\n\"She is so sweet, so pure, so innocent!\" continued the empress. \"My\r\nspotless dove! Will she soil her wings? Oh, sister, speak to me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" cried the nun, for the third time, and the empress trembled, while\r\nher face grew white as that of the prophetess.\r\n\r\n\"I am on my knees,\" murmured she, \"and I await your answer. Sister\r\nMargaret! Sister Margaret! in the name of God, who has endowed you with\r\nsuperhuman wisdom, tell me what is to be the fate of Marie Antoinette?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou hast called on the name of God,\" said the nun, in a strange, clear\r\nvoice, \"and I am forced to answer thee. Thou wouldst know the fate of\r\nMarie Antoinette? Hear it: She will live through much evil, but will\r\nreturn to virtue.\" [Footnote: Swinburne vol. i., p. 351.]\r\n\r\n\"She will then cease to be virtuous,\" cried the empress, bursting into\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\"She will learn much evil,\" repeated the nun, turning uneasily on her\r\nbed. \"She will endure--poor Marie Antoinette! Unhappy Queen of France!\r\nWoe! woe!\"\r\n\r\n\"Woe unto me!\" cried the wretched mother. \"Woe unto her who leadeth her\r\nchildren into temptation!\"\r\n\r\n\"She will return to virtue!\" murmured the nun, indistinctly. \"Poor\r\nQueen--of--France!\"\r\n\r\nWith a loud cry she threw out her arms, and sat upright in the bed. Her\r\neyes opened, and she looked around the room.\r\n\r\n\"Where is the reverend mother?\" cried she. \"Were are the sisters?\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly her eyes rested upon the black and veiled figure of the\r\nempress.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" exclaimed she. \"Away with you, black shadow! I am not yet\r\ndead! Not yet! Oh, this pain! this pain!\" and the nun fell back upon her\r\npillow.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa rose from her knees, and, wild with terror, fled from the\r\nroom. Away she sped through the long, dark corridor to the window that\r\noverlooked the chapel, where the nuns were awaiting her return--away\r\ndown the wide stone staircase, through the hall, out into the open air.\r\nShe hurried into the carriage, and, once seated, fell back upon the\r\ncushions and wept aloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\nTHE PROPHECY.\r\n\r\nThe empress spoke not a word during the drive to the palace. She was so\r\nabsorbed in her sorrow as to be unconscious of the presence of another\r\nperson, and she wept without restraint until the carriage stopped. Then,\r\nstifling her sobs and hastily drying her tears, she dropped her veil and\r\nwalked with her usual majestic gait through the palace halls. In her\r\nanteroom she met a gentleman in waiting coming toward her.\r\n\r\n\"Father Gassner, your majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, so please your majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let him follow me into my cabinet,\" said the empress, going forward,\r\nwhile the courtier and the priest came behind. When she reached the door\r\nof her cabinet she turned. \"Wait here,\" said she. \"When I ring, I beg of\r\nyou to enter, father. The count will await your return in this room.\"\r\n\r\nShe entered her cabinet and closed the door. Once more alone, she gave\r\nvent to her sorrow. She wept aloud, and in her ears she seemed to hear\r\nthe clear, metallic voice of the sick nun pealing out those dreadful\r\nwords: \"She will live through much evil, but will return to virtue.\"\r\n\r\nBut Maria Theresa was no coward. She was determined to master her\r\ncredulity.\r\n\r\n\"I am a simpleton,\" thought she. \"I must forget the dreams of a\r\ndelirious nun. How could I be so weak as to imagine that God would\r\npermit an hysterical invalid to prophesy to a sound and strong woman\r\nlike myself? I will speak with Father Gassner. Perhaps he may see the\r\nfuture differently. If he does, I shall know that they are both false\r\nprophets, and their prophecies I shall throw to the winds.\"\r\n\r\nStrengthened by these reflections, the empress touched her bell. The\r\ndoor opened, and Father Gassner entered the room. He bowed, and then\r\ndrawing his tall, majestic figure to its full height, he remained\r\nstanding by the door, with his large, dark-blue eyes fixed upon the face\r\nof the empress. She returned the glance. There seemed to be a strife\r\nbetween the eyes of the sovereign, who was accustomed to see others bend\r\nbefore her, and those of the inspired man, whose intercourse was with\r\nthe Lord of lords and the King of kings. Each met the other with dignity\r\nand composure.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the empress strode haughtily up to the priest and said in a\r\ntone that sounded almost defiant:\r\n\r\n\"Father Gassner, have you the courage to look me in the face and assert\r\nyourself to be a prophet?\"\r\n\r\n\"It requires no courage to avow a gift, which God, in the superabundance\r\nof His goodness, has bestowed upon one who does not deserve it,\" replied\r\nthe father, gently. \"If my eyes are opened to see, or my hand to heal,\r\nglory be to God who has blessed them! The light, the grace are not mine,\r\nwhy should I deny my Lord?\" [Footnote: Father Gassner was one of the\r\nmost remarkable thaumaturgists of the eighteenth century. He healed all\r\nsorts of diseases by the touch of his hand and multitudes flocked to him\r\nfor cure. His extraordinary powers displeased the bishop of his diocese,\r\nand, to avoid censure, Father Gassner sought protection from the\r\nempress, who held him in great reverence. His prediction concerning the\r\nfate of Marie Antoinette was generally known long before its\r\naccomplishment. It was related to Madame Campan, by a son of Kaunitz,\r\nyears before the Revolution.]\r\n\r\n\"Then, if I question you as to the future, you will answer?\"\r\n\r\n\"If it is given to me to do so, I will answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, then, whether Antoinette will be happy in her marriage?\" The\r\npriest turned pale, but he said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Speak, speak; or I will denounce you as a false prophet!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this the only thing your majesty has to ask of me?\"\r\n\r\n\"The only one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then denounce me--for I cannot answer your majesty.\"\r\n\r\nGassner turned, and his hand was upon the lock of the door.\r\n\r\n\"Stay!\" cried the empress, haughtily. \"I command you, as your sovereign,\r\nto speak the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"The truth?\" cried Gassner, in a voice of anguish, and his large eyes\r\nopened with an expression of horror.\r\n\r\nWhat did he see with those eyes that seemed to look far out into the dim\r\naisles of the terrible future?\r\n\r\n\"The truth!\" echoed the unhappy mother. \"Tell me, will my Antoinette be\r\nhappy?\"\r\n\r\nDeep sighs convulsed the breast of the priest, and, with a look of\r\ninexpressible agony, he answered, solemnly:\r\n\r\n\"Empress of Austria, WE HAVE ALL OUR CROSS TO BEAR!\"\r\n[Footnote: \"Memoires de Madame Campan,\" vol. ii., p. 14.]\r\n\r\nThe empress started back, with a cry.\r\n\r\n\"Again, again!\" murmured she, burying her face in her hands. But\r\nsuddenly coming forward, her eyes flaming like those of an angry\r\nlioness, she said:\r\n\r\n\"What mean these riddles? Speak out at once, and tell me, without\r\nequivocation--what is to be the fate of Antoinette?\"\r\n\r\n\"WE HAVE ALL OUR CROSS TO BEAR,\" repeated the priest, \"and the Queen of\r\nFrance will surely have hers.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words he turned and left the room.\r\n\r\nPale and rigid, the empress stood in the middle of the room, murmuring\r\nto herself the two fearful prophecies: \"She will live through much evil,\r\nbut will return to virtue.\"--\"We have all our cross to bear, and the\r\nQueen of France will surely have hers.\"\r\n\r\nFor a while Maria Theresa was overwhelmed by the double blow she had\r\nreceived. But it was not in her nature to succumb to circumstances. She\r\nmust overrule them.\r\n\r\nShe rang her bell, and a page entered the room.\r\n\r\n\"Let a messenger be dispatched to Prince Kaunitz, I wish to see his\r\nhighness. He can come to me unannounced.\"\r\n\r\nNot long after the prince made his appearance. A short sharp glance at\r\nthe agitated mien of the empress showed to the experienced diplomatist\r\nthat to-day, as so often before, he must oppose the shield of\r\nindifference to the storm of passion with which he was about to contend.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty,\" said he, \"has sent for me, just as I was about to\r\nrequest an audience. I am in receipt of letters from the emperor. He has\r\nspent a day with the King of Prussia.\"\r\n\r\nHe attempted to give the letters into the hands of the empress, but she\r\nput them back with a gesture of impatience.\r\n\r\n\"Prince Kaunitz,\" said she, \"it is you who have done this-you must undo\r\nit. It cannot, shall not be.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does your majesty mean?\" asked Kaunitz, astonished. \"I speak of\r\nthat which lies nearest my heart,\" said the empress, warmly.\r\n\r\n\"Of the meeting of the emperor with the King of Prussia,\" returned\r\nKaunitz, quietly. \"Yesterday they met at Neisse. It was a glorious\r\ninterview. The two monarchs embraced, and the emperor remarked-\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough, enough!\" cried Maria Theresa, impatiently. \"You affect to\r\nmisunderstand me. I speak of Antoinette's engagement to the dauphin. It\r\nmust be broken. My daughter shall not go to France.\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz was so completely astounded, so sincerely astounded, that he was\r\nspeechless. The paint upon his face could not conceal the angry flush\r\nthat colored it, nor his pet locks cover the wrinkles that rose up to\r\ndisfigure his forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Do not stare at me as if you thought I was parting with my senses,\"\r\ncried the empress. \"I know very well what I say. I will not turn my\r\ninnocent Antoinette into that den of corruption. She shall not bear a\r\ncross from which it is in my power to save her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who speaks of crosses?\" asked Kaunitz, bewildered. \"The only thing of\r\nwhich I have heard is a royal crown wherewith her brow is to be decked.\"\r\n\r\n\"She shall not wear that crown?\" exclaimed Maria Theresa. \"God himself\r\nhas warned me through the lips of His prophets, and not unheeded shall\r\nthe warning fall.\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz breathed more freely, and his features resumed their wonted\r\ncalmness.\r\n\r\n\"If that is all,\" thought he, gayly, \"I shall be victorious. An ebullition\r\nof superstition is easily quieted by a little good news.\" \"Your majesty\r\nhas been following the new fashion,\" said he, aloud; \"you have been\r\nconsulting the fortune-tellers. I presume you have visited the nun who\r\nis subject to pious hysterics; and Father Gassner, I see, has been\r\nvisiting your majesty, for I met him as I was coming to the palace. I\r\ncould not help laughing as I saw his absurd length of visage.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa, in reply to this irony, related the answers which had\r\nbeen made to her questions.\r\n\r\nKaunitz listened with sublime indifference, and evinced not a spark of\r\nsympathy. When the empress had concluded her story, he merely said\r\n\r\n\"What else, your majesty?\"\r\n\r\n\"What else?\" echoed the empress, surprised \"Yes, your majesty. Surely\r\nthere must be something more than a pair of vague sentences, a pair of\r\n'ohs' and 'ahs;' and a sick nun and a silly priest. These insignificant\r\nnothings are certainly not enough to overturn the structure which for\r\nten years we have employed all our skill to build up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I well know that you are an infidel and an unbeliever, Kaunitz,\" cried\r\nthe empress, vexed at the quiet sneers of her minister. \"I know you\r\nbelieve that only which you can understand and explain.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty, I believe all that is reasonable. What I cannot\r\ncomprehend is unreasonable.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress glanced angrily at his stony countenance. \"God sometimes\r\nspeaks to us through the mouths of His chosen ones,\" cried she; \"and, as\r\nI believe in the inspiration of Sister Margaret and Father Gassner, my\r\ndaughter shall not go to France.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that your majesty's unalterable resolution?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" returned Kaunitz, bowing, \"allow me to make a request for\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Allow me at once to retire from your majesty's service.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kaunitz!\" exclaimed Maria Theresa, \"is it possible that you would\r\nforsake me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty; it is you who forsake me. You are willing, for the\r\nsake of two crazy seers, to destroy the fabric which it has been the\r\nwork of my life to construct. Your majesty desires that I should remain\r\nyour minister, and with my own hand should undo the web that I have\r\nwoven with such trouble to myself? All Europe knows that the French\r\nalliance is my work. To this end I have labored by day and lain awake by\r\nnight; to this end I have flattered and bribed; to this end I have seen\r\nmy friend De Choiseul disgraced, while I bowed low before his miserable\r\nsuccessor, that I might win him and that wretched Du Barry to my\r\npurpose!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are irretrievably bent upon this alliance?\" asked the empress,\r\nthoughtfully. \"It was then not to gratify me that you sought to place a\r\ncrown upon my dear child's head?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty's wishes have always been sacred to me, but I should never\r\nhave sought to gratify them, had they not been in accordance with my\r\nsense of duty to Austria. I have not sought to make a queen of the\r\nArchduchess Maria Antoinette. I have sought to unite Austria with\r\nFrance, and to strengthen the southwestern powers of Europe against the\r\ninfidelity and barbarism of Prussia and Russia. In spite of all that is\r\ntaking place at Neisse, Austria and Prussia are, and ever will be,\r\nenemies. The king and the emperor may flatter and smile, but neither\r\nbelieves what the other says. Frederick will never lose an opportunity\r\nof robbing. He ogles Russia, and would gladly see her our 'neighbor,' if\r\nby so doing he were to gain an insignificant province for Prussia. It is\r\nto ward off these dangerous accomplices that we seek alliance with\r\nFrance, and through France, with Spain, Portugal, and Italy. And now,\r\nwhen the goal is won, and the prize is ours, your majesty retracts her\r\nimperial word! You are the sovereign, and your will must be, done. But I\r\ncannot lend my hand to that which my reason condemns as unwise, and my\r\nconscience as dishonorable. I beg of your majesty, to-day and forever,\r\nto dismiss me from your service!\"\r\n\r\nThe empress did not make any reply. She had risen, and was walking\r\nhastily up and down, murmuring low, inarticulate words and heaving deep,\r\nconvulsive sighs. Kaunitz followed her with the eye of a cool physician,\r\nwho watches the crisis of a brain-fever. He looked down, however, as the\r\nempress, stopping, raised her dark, glowing eyes to his. When he met her\r\nglance his expression had changed; it had become as usual.\r\n\r\n\"You have heard the pleadings of the mother,\" said she, breathing hard,\r\n\"and you have silenced them with your cold arguments. The empress has\r\nheard, and she it is who must decide against herself. She has no right\r\nto sacrifice her empire to her maternity. May God forgive me,\" continued\r\nshe, solemnly clasping her hands, \"if I err in quelling the voice of my\r\nlove which cries so loudly against this union. Let it be accomplished!\r\nMarie Antoinette shall be the bride of Louis XVI.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spoken like the noble Empress of Austria!\" cried Kaunitz, triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\"Do not praise me,\" returned Maria Theresa sadly; \"but hear what I have\r\nto say. You have spoken words so bold, that it would seem you fancy\r\nyourself to be Emperor of Austria. It was not you who sought alliance\r\nwith France, but myself. You did nothing but follow out my intentions\r\nand obey my commands. The sin of my refusal, therefore, was nothing to\r\nyou or your conscience--it rested on my head alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"May God preserve your majesty to your country and your subjects! May\r\nyou long be Austria's head, and I--your right hand!\" exclaimed Kaunitz.\r\n\r\n\"You do not then wish to retire?\" asked she, with a languid smile.\r\n\r\n\"I beg of your majesty to forgive and retain me.\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it, then,\" returned the empress, with a light inclination of the\r\nhead. \"But I cannot hear any more to-day. You have no sympathy with my\r\ntrials as a mother. I have sacrificed my child to Austria, but my heart\r\nis pierced with sorrow and apprehension. Leave me to my tears. I cannot\r\nfeel for any one except my child--my poor, innocent child!\"\r\n\r\nShe turned hastily away, that he might not see the tears that were\r\nalready streaming down her face. Kaunitz bowed, and left the cabinet\r\nwith his usual cold, proud step.\r\n\r\nThe minister once gone, Maria Theresa gave herself up to the wildest\r\ngrief. No one saw her anguish but God; no one ever knew how the powerful\r\nempress writhed and wrung her hands in her powerless agony; no one but\r\nGod and the dead emperor, whose mild eyes beamed compassion from the\r\ngilt frame in which his picture hung, upon the wall. To this picture\r\nMaria Theresa at last raised her eyes, and it seemed, to her excited\r\nimagination, that her husband smiled and whispered words of consolation.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear Franz, I hear you,\" said she. \"You would remind me that this\r\nis our wedding-day. Alas, I know it! Once a day of joy, and from this\r\nmoment the anniversary of a great sorrow! Franz, it is OUR child that is\r\nthe victim! The sweet Antoinette, whose eyes are so like her father's!\r\nOh, dear husband, my heart is heavy with grief; Why may I not go to rest\r\ntoo? But thou wilt not love me if my courage fail. I will be brave,\r\nFranz; I will work, and try to do my duty.\"\r\n\r\nShe approached her writing-table, and began to overlook the heaps of\r\npapers that awaited her inspection and signature. Gradually her brow\r\ncleared and her face resumed its usual expression of deep thought and\r\nhigh resolve. The mother forgot her grief, and the empress was absorbed\r\nin the cares of state.\r\n\r\nShe felt so strongly the comfort and sustenance derived from labor, that\r\non that day she dined alone, and returned immediately to her\r\nwriting-desk. Twilight came on, and still the empress was at work.\r\nFinally the rolling of carriages toward the imperial theatre was heard,\r\nand presently the shouts of the applauding audience. The empress heard\r\nnothing. She had never attended the theatre since her husband's death,\r\nand it was nothing to her that to-night Lessing's beautiful drama,\r\n\"Emilia Galotti,\" was being represented for the first time in Vienna.\r\n\r\nTwilight deepened into night, and the empress rang for lights. Then\r\nretiring to her dressing-room, she threw off her heavy court costume,\r\nand exchanged it for a simple peignoir, in which she returned to her\r\ncabinet and still wrote on.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the stillness was broken by a knock, and a page entered with a\r\ngolden salver, on which lay a letter.\r\n\r\n\"A courier from Florence, your majesty,\" said he.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa took the letter, and dismissed the page. \"From my\r\nLeopold,\" said she, while she opened it. \"It is an extra courier. It\r\nmust announce the accouchement of his wife. Oh, my heart, how it beats!\"\r\n\r\nWith trembling hands she held the missive and read it. But at once her\r\nface was lighted up with joy, and throwing herself upon her knees before\r\nthe portrait of the emperor, she said, \"Franz, Leopold has given us a\r\ngrandson. Do you hear?\"\r\n\r\nNo answer came in response to the joyful cry of the empress, and she\r\ncould not bear the burden of her joy alone. Some one must rejoice with\r\nher. She craved sympathy, and she must go out to seek it.\r\n\r\nShe left her cabinet. Unmindful of her dress, she sped through the long\r\ncorridors, farther and still farther, down the staircase and away to the\r\nextremest end of the palace, until she reached the imperial theatre.\r\n\r\nThat night it was crowded. The interest of the spectators had deepened\r\nas the play went on. They were absorbed in the scene between Emilia and\r\nher father, when a door was heard to open and to shut.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in the imperial box, which had so long been empty, a tall and\r\nnoble figure bent forward, far over the railing, and a clear, musical\r\nvoice cried out:\r\n\r\n\"Leopold has a son!\"\r\n\r\nThe audience, as if electrified, rose with one accord from their seats.\r\nAll turned toward the imperial box. Each one had recognized the voice of\r\nthe adored Maria Theresa, and every heart over-flowed with the joy of\r\nthe moment.\r\n\r\nThe empress repeated her words:\r\n\r\n\"Leopold has a son, and it is born on my wedding-day. Wish me joy, dear\r\nfriends, of my grandson!\"\r\n\r\nThen arose such a storm of congratulations as never before had been\r\nheard within those theatre walls. The women wept, and the men waved\r\ntheir hats and cheered; while all, with one voice, cried out. \"Long live\r\nMaria Theresa! Long live the imperial grandmother!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\nTHE GIFT.\r\n\r\nAll prophecies defying, Maria Theresa had given her daughter to France.\r\nIn the month of May, 1770, the Archduchess Marie Antoinette was married\r\nby proxy in Vienna; and amid the ringing of bells, the booming of\r\ncannon, and the shouts of the populace, the beautiful young dauphiness\r\nleft Austria to meet her inevitable fate.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the imperial palace, too, one room was darkening under the\r\nshadow of approaching death. It was that in which Isabella's daughter\r\nwas passing from earth to heaven.\r\n\r\nThe emperor knew that his child was dying; and many an hour he spent at\r\nher solitary bedside, where, tranquil and smiling, she murmured words\r\nwhich her father knew were whispered to the angels.\r\n\r\nThe emperor sorrowed deeply for the severance of the last tie that bound\r\nhim to the bright and beautiful dream of his early married life. But he\r\nwas so accustomed to sorrow, that on the occasion of his sister's\r\nmarriage, he had gone through the forms required by etiquette, without\r\nany visible emotion.\r\n\r\nBut the festivities were at an end. The future Queen of France had\r\nbidden farewell to her native Vienna, and the marriage guests had\r\ndeparted; while darker and darker grew the chamber of the dying child,\r\nand sadder the face of the widowed father. The emperor kissed his\r\ndaughter's burning forehead, and held her little transparent hand in\r\nhis. \"Farewell, my angel,\" whispered he; \"since thy mother calls thee,\r\ngo, my little Theresa. Tell her that she was my only love--my first and\r\nlast. Go, beloved, and pray for thy unhappy father.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more he kissed her, and when he raised his head, her face was\r\nmoistened with his tears. He turned hastily away and left the room.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" thought he, \"to my duty, I must forget my own sorrows that I\r\nmay wipe away the tears of my sorrowing people. There is so much grief\r\nand want in Austria! Oh, my child, my little one! Amid the blessings of\r\nthe suffering poor shalt thou stretch forth thy wings and take the\r\nflight to heaven!\"\r\n\r\nHe was on his way to seek an audience of his mother. Maria Theresa was\r\nin her cabinet, and was somewhat surprised to see her son at this\r\nunusual hour of the day.\r\n\r\n\"I come to your majesty to beg a boon,\" said Joseph, with a sad smile.\r\n\"Yesterday you were distributing Antoinette's wedding-gifts to your\r\nchildren; I alone received nothing. Is there nothing for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing for you, my son!\" exclaimed Maria Theresa, astonished. \"Why,\r\nevery thing is yours, and therefore I have nothing to give. Where your\r\nright is indisputable, my presents are superfluous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mother; but it does not become one so generous as you, to let her\r\neldest son wait for an inheritance, when she might make him a handsome\r\npresent of her own free will. Be generous, then, and give me something,\r\ntoo. I wish to be on an equality with the other children.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, you grown-up child, what will you have?\" asked the empress,\r\nlaughing. \"Of course you have already chosen your gift, and it is mere\r\ngallantry on your part to beg for what you might take without leave. But\r\nlet us hear. What is it? You have only to ask and have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! May I choose my wedding-gift?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you imperial beggar, you may.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, give me the government claims upon the four lower classes.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress looked aghast. \"Is it money you desire?\" said she. \"Say how\r\nmuch, and you shall have it from my private purse. But do not rob the\r\npoor! The claim that you covet is the tax levied upon all the working\r\nclasses, and you know how numerous they are.\"\r\n\r\n\"For that very reason, I want it. It is a princely gift. Shall I have\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\nThe empress reflected for a few moments. \"I know,\" said she, looking up\r\nwith one of her sweetest smiles, \"I know that you will not misuse your\r\npower; for I remember the fate of your father's legacy, the three\r\nmillions of coupons. You shall have the claim, my son. It is yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will your majesty draw out the deed of gift?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, my son. It is YOUR wedding-gift from our darling Antoinette.\r\nBut you will acquaint me, from time to time, with the use you are making\r\nof your power over the poor classes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will render my account to your majesty. But first draw out the deed.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress stepped to her escritoire and wrote a few lines, to which\r\nshe affixed the imperial signature and seal.\r\n\r\n\"There it is,\" said she. \"I bestow upon my son, the emperor, all the\r\ngovernment claims to the impost levied upon the four lower classes. Will\r\nthat do?\"\r\n\r\n\"It will, and from my heart I thank my dear mother for the gracious\r\ngift.\"\r\n\r\nHe took the hand of the empress to kiss it, but she held his fast in her\r\ngrasp, and looked at him with an expression of tenderness; and anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"You are pale, my son,\" said she, affectionately. \"I see that your heart\r\nis sad.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" replied Joseph, with quivering lip, \"I should rejoice, for I\r\nam about to have an angel in heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor little Theresa!\" murmured the empress, while the tears rose to her\r\neyes. \"She has never been a healthy child. Isabella calls her hence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Joseph, bitterly; \"she calls my child away, that, she may\r\nbreak the last link that bound her to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must believe, my child, that it is for the best. The will of God,\r\nhowever painful its manifestations, is holy, wise and merciful. Isabella\r\ndeclared to us that she would call the child when it had reached its\r\nseventh year; she goes to her mother. And now that this bitter dream of\r\nyour early love is past, perhaps your heart may awaken once more to\r\nlove. There are many beautiful princesses in Europe, and not one of them\r\nwould refuse the hand of the Emperor of Austria. It is for you to\r\nchoose, and no one shall dictate your choice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would your majesty convert me into a bluebeard?\" cried Joseph,\r\ncoloring. \"Do you not see that I murder my wives? Enough, that two of\r\nthem are buried in the chapel of the Capuchins, and that to-morrow,\r\nperhaps, my child will join them. Leopold has given an heir to my\r\nthrone, and I am satisfied.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you talk of a successor, my son?\" said the empress, \"you who are\r\nso young?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty, I am old,\" replied Joseph, mournfully--\"so old that I have\r\nno hope of happiness on earth. You see that to-day, when you have been\r\nso gracious, I am too wretched to do aught but thank you for your\r\nsplendid gift. Let me retire, then, to my unhappy solitude; I am not fit\r\nto look upon your sweet and honored countenance. I must exile myself\r\nuntil my trial is past.\"\r\n\r\nHe left the room, and hastening to his cabinet, \"Now,\" exclaimed he,\r\n\"now for my mother's gift.\"\r\n\r\nHe sat dozen and wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR PRINCE KALUITZ: By the enclosed, you will see that the empress,\r\nmy mother, has presented me with all the government claims upon the\r\nworking-classes. Will you make immediate arrangements to acquaint the\r\ncollectors with the following:\r\n\r\n\"'No tax shall be collected from the working-classes during the\r\nremainder of my life.' \"Joseph.\" [Footnote: Historical. Hubner, vol.\r\nii., p, 86.]\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" thought he, as he laid aside his pen, \"this document will gladden\r\nmany a heart, and it will, perchance, win forgiveness for my own\r\nweakness. But, why should monarchs have hearts of flesh like other men,\r\nsince they have no right to feel, to love, or to grieve? Be still,\r\nthrobbing heart, that the emperor may forget himself, to remember his\r\nsubjects! Yes, my subjects--my children --I will make you happy! I\r\nwill--'\r\n\r\nThere was a light tap at the door, and the governess of the little\r\nArchduchess Maria Theresa entered the room.\r\n\r\n\"I have come,\" said she, in a faltering voice, \"to announce to your\r\nmajesty that the princess has breathed her last.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor made no reply. He motioned the lady to retire, and bowing\r\nhis head, gave way to one long burst of grief.\r\n\r\nFor hours he sat there, solitary and broken-hearted. At length the\r\nparoxysm was over. He raised his head, and his eyes were tearless and\r\nbright.\r\n\r\n\"It is over!\" exclaimed he, in clear and unfaltering tones. \"The past is\r\nburied; and I am born anew to a life whereof the aim shall be Austria's\r\ngreatness and her people's welfare. I am no more a husband, no more a\r\nfather. Austria shall be my bride, and every Austrian my child.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\nTHE CONFERENCE.\r\n\r\nGreat excitement prevailed at Neustadt. All work was suspended, all the\r\nshops were shut, and although it was not Sunday, the people, in their\r\nholiday attire, seemed to have cast away all thought of the wants,\r\ncares, and occupations of everyday life. For, although it was not\r\nSunday, it was a holiday--a holiday for Neustadt, since this was the\r\nbirthday of Neustadt's fame. For hundreds of years the little village\r\nhad existed in profound obscurity, its simple inhabitants dreaming away\r\ntheir lives far from the clamor of the world and its vicissitudes. Their\r\nslumbers had been disturbed by the Seven Years' War, and many a father,\r\nson, husband, and lover had fought and fallen on its bloodthirsty\r\nbattlefield. But with the return of peace came insignificance, and\r\nvillagers of Neustadt went on dreaming as before.\r\n\r\nToday, however, on the 3d of September, in the year 1770, they were\r\nawakened by an event which gave to Neustadt a place in history. The two\r\ngreatest potentates in Germany were to meet there to bury their past\r\nenmity, and pledge to each other the right hand of fellowship.\r\n\r\nThese two potentates were the Emperor of Austria and the King of\r\nPrussia. It was, therefore, not surprising that all Neustadt should be\r\nout of doors to witness the baptism of Neustadt's celebrity.\r\n\r\nThe streets were thronged with well-dressed people, the houses were hung\r\nwith garlands and wreaths, the church-bells were ringing, and all the\r\ndignitaries of the town had turned out to witness the pageant.\r\n\r\nAnd now the moment had arrived. The thunder of cannon, the shouts of the\r\npeople who thronged the avenue that led to the palace, and the clang of\r\nmartial music, announced the approach of the emperor, whom his people\r\nwere frantic to welcome.\r\n\r\nHe came, a young man, on a jet-black Arabian, who rode ahead of those\r\nglittering nobles--this was the Emperor Joseph, the hope of Austria.\r\n\r\nA thousand voices rent the air with shouts, while Joseph smiled, and\r\nbowed, and raised his eyes to the balconies, whence showers of bouquets\r\nwere falling around him.\r\n\r\nHe was inclining his head, when a wrest, of red roses and\r\norange-flowers, aimed by some skilful hand, fell directly upon his\r\nsaddle-bow. He smiled, and taking up the wreath, looked around to see\r\nwhence it came. Suddenly his eye brightened, and his countenance\r\nexpressed increased interest, while he reined in his horse that he might\r\nlook again at a lady who was leaning over a balcony just above him. Her\r\ntall and elegant figure was clothed in a dress of black velvet, closed\r\nfrom her white throat to her round waist by buttons of large and\r\nmagnificent diamonds, whose brilliancy was almost dazzling. Her youthful\r\nand beautiful face was colorless, with that exquisite and delicate\r\npallor which has no affinity to ill-health, but resembles the spiritual\r\nbeauty of a marble statue. Her glossy black hair defined the exquisite\r\noval of that fair face, as a rich frame sets off a fine painting. On her\r\nhead she wore a diadem of brilliants, which confined a rich black-lace\r\nveil, that fluttered like a dark cloud around her graceful figure. Her\r\ncountenance wore an expression of profound sadness, and her large,\r\nlustrous eyes were riveted with an earnest gaze upon the emperor.\r\n\r\nHe bowed to his saddle-bow, but she did not seem to recognize the\r\ncompliment, for her glance and her sadness were unchanged.\r\n\r\n\"The wreath is not from her,\" thought Joseph, with a feeling of\r\ndisappointment; but as he turned for one more look at her lovely face,\r\nhe remarked a bouquet which she wore in her bosom. It was similar to the\r\nwreath which he held. The same white orange-blossoms and red roses,\r\nfastened together by the same white and red ribbon, whose long streamers\r\nwere now fluttering in the wind.\r\n\r\nA triumphant smile overspread the features of the emperor, as blushing,\r\nhe bowed again and passed on. But his face no longer wore its expression\r\nof careless gratification. He grew absent and thoughtful; he forgot to\r\nreturn the greetings of the people; and vainly the ladies, who crowded\r\nwindow and balcony, threw flowers in his way, or waved their\r\nhandkerchiefs in greeting. He saw nothing but the beautiful vision in\r\nthe black veil, and wondered whence she came and what could be the\r\nhidden meaning of the red and white flowers which she wore and gave to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe was glad when the pageant of his entry into Neustadt was over, and,\r\ndismounting quickly, he entered the palace, followed by Field-Marshal\r\nLacy and Count Rosenberg.\r\n\r\nThe people looked after them and shouted anew. But their attention was\r\ndirected from the emperor to a carriage, drawn by four horses, which,\r\nadvancing in the very centre of the brilliant cortege, seemed to contain\r\nsome imperial personage, for the staff were around it, as though forming\r\nits escort. The curtains of the carriage were all drawn, so that nothing\r\ncould be seen of its occupant.\r\n\r\nWho could it be? A woman, of course; since no man would dare to be\r\ndriven, while the Emperor of Austria rode. It could be no other than the\r\nEmpress Maria Theresa, who had taken the journey to Neustadt, that she\r\nmight look, face to face, upon her celebrated opponent, and offer him\r\nher own hand in pledge of future good understanding.\r\n\r\nWhile the populace hoped and speculated, the mysterious equipage arrived\r\nbefore the palace gates. The rich-liveried footmen sprang from the\r\nrumble, and stationed themselves at the door of the coach. The two\r\nothers, who were seated on the box, did likewise; bringing with them, as\r\nthey alighted on the ground, a roll of rich Turkey carpeting, which they\r\nlaid, with great precision, from the carriage to the palace steps.\r\n\r\nThen the people were convinced that it was the empress. Who but the\r\nsovereign lady of Austria and Hungary would walk the streets upon a\r\ncarpet of such magnificence? And they thronged nearer, eager to catch\r\nthe first glance of their beloved and honored empress.\r\n\r\nThe carpet was laid without a wrinkle. One of the footmen opened the\r\ncarriage door, while another approached the fore-wheel.\r\n\r\n\"She comes! she comes!\" cried the populace, and they crowded around in\r\neager delight.\r\n\r\nOne foot was put forward--not a foot encased in a satin slipper, but a\r\nfoot in a buckled shoe, which, glistening though it was with diamonds,\r\nwas not that of an empress. The occupant of the carriage was a man!\r\n\r\n\"A man!\" exclaimed the bystanders, astounded. Yes. Here he came, wrapped\r\nup in a bearskin, which, on this warm summer day, was enough to dissolve\r\nan ordinary human being into vapor. Not content with his wrapping, his\r\nhands were encased in a huge muff, which he held close to his face, that\r\nhe might not inhale one single breath of the air that was refreshing\r\neverybody else. His head was covered by a hood which concealed his face,\r\nof which nothing was visible save a pair of light-blue eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen he had disappeared within the palace doors, the footmen rolled up\r\nthe carpet and replaced it on the coach-box.\r\n\r\nThe populace, who had been looking on in speechless wonder, now began to\r\nlaugh and whisper. Some said it was the King of the North Pole; others\r\ndeclared it was an Arctic bear; others again thought the gentleman had\r\nstarted for Siberia and had lost his way. Finally the desire to know who\r\nhe was grew uncontrollable, and, thronging around his lackeys, the\r\npeople shouted out:\r\n\r\n\"Who is he? Tell us, who is be?\"\r\n\r\nThe lackeys, with the gravity of heralds-at-arms, shouted out in return:\r\n\r\n\"This is his highness Prince Kaunitz, prime minister of their majesties\r\nthe Empress Maria Theresa and the Emperor Joseph of Austria!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\nKAUNITZ.\r\n\r\n\"What an abominable idea!\" exclaimed Prince Kaunitz, as, perfectly\r\nexhausted from his journey, he fell into an armchair in his own room.\r\n\"What an abominable idea to undertake this journey! These German roads\r\nare as rough and uncouth as the Germans themselves, and I only wonder\r\nthat we have arrived without breaking our ribs!\"\r\n\r\n\"It would certainly have been more convenient,\" said Baron Binder, \"if\r\nthe King of Prussia had visited us in Vienna.\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz turned his large eyes full upon his friend.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" said he, \"that you jest, Binder; for you MUST know that it\r\nis never safe to have your enemy under your own roof.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your highness, then, has no confidence in the protestations of love\r\nthat are going on between the emperor and the king?\"\r\n\r\nThe prince made no reply. He was looking at himself in a mirror,\r\ncriticising his toilet, which had just been completed by the expert\r\nHippolyte. Apparently it was satisfactory, for he looked up and spoke:\r\n\r\n\"You are a grown-up child, Binder; you stare, and believe every thing.\r\nHave you not yet learned that statesmanship recognizes nothing but\r\ninterests? To-day it is to the interest of Frederick to squeeze our\r\nhands and protest that he loves us; to-morrow (if he can), he will put\r\nanother Silesia in his royal pocket. We, too, have found it convenient\r\nto write him a love-letter or two; but to-day, if we would, we would\r\npluck off his crown, and make him a little margrave again! Our intimacy\r\nreminds me of a sight I once saw while we were in Paris. It was a cage,\r\nin which animals, naturally antagonistic, were living in a state of\r\nperfect concord. A dog and cat were dining sociably together from one\r\nplate, and, not far off, a turkey-hen was comfortably perched upon the\r\nback of a fox, who, so far from betraying any symptom of appetite for\r\nthe turkey, looked quite oblivious of her proximity. I gave the keeper a\r\nlouis d'or, and he told me his secret. The dog's teeth were drawn, and\r\nthe cat's claws were pared off; this, of course, forced both to keep the\r\npeace. As for the turkey-hen, she was fastened to the back of the fox\r\nwith fine wire, and this was the secret of her security.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" cried Binder, laughing, \"this is the history of many a human\r\nalliance. How many foxes I have known who carried their hens upon their\r\nbacks and made believe to love them, because they dared not do\r\notherwise!\"\r\n\r\n\"Peace, Binder, my story is not yet ended. One morning the dog and the\r\ncat were found dead in THEIR corner; and in the other, the fox lay\r\nbleeding and moaning; while of the hen, nothing remained save her\r\nfeathers. Time--the despot that rules us all, had outwitted the keeper\r\nand asserted the laws of Nature. The cat's claws had grown out, and so\r\nhad the dog's teeth. The fox, after much pondering over his misfortunes,\r\nhad discovered the reason why he could not reach the hen; and this done,\r\nhe worked at the wires until they broke. Of course he revenged himself\r\non the spot by gobbling her up; but in his wrath at the wires, he had\r\nthrust them so deeply into his own flesh that the wounds they made upon\r\nhis body caused his death. And so ended the compulsory alliance of four\r\nnatural enemies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does your highness apply that anecdote to us?\" asked Binder. \"Are we to\r\nend like the cat and the dog?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the present,\" said Kaunitz, thoughtfully, \"our teeth and claws are\r\nharmless. We must wait until they have grown out again!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your highness, then, assigns us the role of the dog?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. I leave it to Prussia to play the cat--she has scratched us\r\nmore than once, and even to-day, when she covers her paws with velvet, I\r\nfeel the claws underneath. I came hither to watch her. I am curious to\r\nknow what it is in Frederick that has so bewitched the young Emperor of\r\nAustria.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would appear that his majesty of Prussia has extraordinary powers of\r\nfascination. No one can resist him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall resist him,\" said Kaunitz, \"for against his fascinations I am\r\ndefended by the talisman of our mutual hate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not say so, your highness. The King of Prussia may fear, but he\r\ncannot hate you. And did he not make it a special request that you\r\nshould accompany the emperor?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did; and however disinclined I might be to accept his invitation, I\r\nhave come lest he should suppose that I am afraid to encounter his eagle\r\neyes. [Footnote: Ferrand, \"History of the Dismemberment of Poland,\" vol.\r\ni., p. 103.] I fear HIM! HE intimidate me! It is expedient for the\r\npresent that Austria and Prussia should be quasi allies, for in this way\r\npeace has been secured to Europe. But my system of diplomacy, which the\r\nempress has made her own, forbids me to make any permanent alliance with\r\na prince who lives politically from hand to mouth, and has no fixed line\r\nof policy. [Footnote: Kaunitz's own words. See Ferrand. vol. i., v. 69.]\r\nNo--I do not fear him; for I see through his hypocritical professions,\r\nand in spite of his usurped crown I feel myself to be more than his\r\nequal. If he has won thirteen victories on the battle-field, I have\r\nfought twice as many in the cabinet, where the fight is hand to hand,\r\nand the victor conquers without an army. On this field he will scarcely\r\ndare to encounter me. If he does, he will find his master for once!\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" repeated Kaunitz emphatically, \"he will find his master in me. I\r\nhave never failed to make other men subservient to my schemes, and the\r\nKing of Prussia shall grace my triumph with the rest. He is the vassal\r\nof Austria, and I will be the one to force him back to his allegiance.\r\nIt is scandalous that this petty king should have been suffered to play\r\nan important part in European affairs. I will drive him from his\r\naccidental grandeur, and he shall return to his duty. I will humble him\r\nif I can; for this King of Prussia is the only man in Europe who has\r\ndenied me the honors and consideration due me as a politician and a\r\nprince.\" [Footnote: Kaunitz's own words. Ferrand, vol. i., p. 104]\r\n\r\nWhile Kaunitz spoke, his marble face grew animated, and his eyes glowed\r\nwith the fire of hate.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, prince!\" exclaimed Binder, anxious to subdue the fiend that was\r\nrising in his friend's heart, \"everybody knows that you are the coachman\r\nof Europe, and that it is in the power of no man to wrest the reins from\r\nyour hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"May this Prussian ride behind as my footman!\" cried Kaunitz, gnashing\r\nhis teeth. \"Oh, I know him! I know why he pays a million of subsidy\r\nannually to his accomplice, the virtuous Catherine, that she may\r\ncontinue her assaults upon Poland and Turkey! I know whither his\r\nlongings travel; but when he stretches his hand out for the booty, we\r\ntoo will be there to claim our share, and he shall yield it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your highness speaks in riddles,\" said Binder, shrugging his shoulders.\r\n\"I am accustomed, as you know, to look through your political\r\nspectacles; and I beg you to explain, for I am perfectly at a loss to\r\nunderstand you.\"\r\n\r\nThe countenance of Kaunitz had resumed its impassible look. He threw\r\nback his head, and fixed his cold, heartless blue eyes upon the baron.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know,\" said he, \"what William the Silent once said of himself?\r\n'If I knew that my night-cap had found out my thoughts I would throw it\r\nin the fire.' Now, Binder, do not aim to be my night-cap, or I shall\r\nburn you to a cinder.--But enough of this. It would seem that the\r\nEmperor Joseph expects me to wait upon him. Well--if it please him that\r\nI should make the first visit, I will humor him. When a man feels that\r\nhe is lord and master of another, he can afford to be condescending! I\r\nwill indulge the emperor's whim.\"\r\n\r\nHe rang, and one of his valets entered the room.\r\n\r\n\"Is his majesty in the castle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your highness. His majesty has been reviewing the troops.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is his majesty now?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is with his suite in the parlor that overlooks the square.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it far from this room?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your highness. It is close by.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then reach me a cloak and muff, and woe to you if I encounter a draught\r\non my way!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\nSOUVENIR D'EPERIES.\r\n\r\nThe emperor stood in the centre of the room in lively conversation with\r\nthe gentlemen of his suite. As Kaunitz entered, he stopped at once, and\r\ncoming forward, received the prince with a cordial welcome.\r\n\r\nKaunitz replied by a low bow, and nodded slightly to Prince de Ligne and\r\nGeneral Lacy.\r\n\r\n\"Your highness is just in time,\" said the emperor. \"These gentlemen need\r\nencouragement. They have been blushing and trembling like two young\r\ndebutantes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before whom, your majesty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!--before the great Frederick, of course. And De Ligne, who is\r\nconsidered the most elegant man in Vienna, actually trembled more than\r\nanybody else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Actors trembling before their manager!\" said Kaunitz, with a slight\r\nshrug. \"Compose yourselves, gentlemen; the King of Prussia is too much\r\nabsorbed in his own role to take any notice of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is right,\" cried the emperor. \"Encourage the debutantes, prince!\"\r\n\r\n\"I scarcely think that the prince will succeed where your majesty has\r\nfailed,\" said General von Lacy proudly.\r\n\r\n\"And his highness will hardly have any time to devote to us, for\r\ndoubtless he too is practising the role which he must play before the\r\nKing of Prussia,\" added De Ligne.\r\n\r\n\"I beg to impress upon the Prince de Ligne,\" interrupted Kaunitz, \"that\r\nthe verb 'must' is one which I am well accustomed to conjugate for\r\nothers but never allow others to conjugate for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I for one have had it conjugated for me by your highness,\" said the\r\nemperor, laughing. \"Nobody in Austria knows it in all its moods and\r\ntenses better than I. But I have always recognized you as my teacher,\r\nand hope always to remain your faithful pupil.\"\r\n\r\nThe clouds which were gathering on Kaunitz's brow now shifted to the\r\nfaces of Lacy and De Ligne.\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing to teach your majesty,\" replied Kaunitz, almost smiling;\r\n\"but allow me as a faithful servant to offer you a suggestion. Present\r\nto the King of Prussia that beautiful wreath which you hold in your\r\nhand, as an emblem of the friendship which to-day we pledge to Prussia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I,\" cried Joseph, while he held up his wreath and admired its white\r\nand red roses. \"I shall keep my bouquet, were it only for the sake of\r\nthe beautiful donor. You, prince, who penetrate all things, have pity on\r\nme, and find out her name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty saw her, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Saw her? Yes, by Aphrodite, I did; and never in my life did I see a\r\nlovelier woman. She stood there in her velvet dress and veil, looking\r\nfor all the world like the queen of night, of starry night. You see how\r\nshe has impressed me, since I, who am so prosaic, launch out into\r\nextravagance of speech to describe her.\"\r\n\r\n\"She was in mourning?\" asked Kaunitz thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Clothed in black, except the diamonds that sparkled on her bodice, and\r\nthe bouquet (a match to mine) which she wore in her bosom. Ah, your\r\nhighness, how you look at my poor flowers, as if treason were lurking\r\namong their leaves!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a beautiful bouquet,\" said Kaunitz, eying it critically, \"and\r\nvery peculiar. Will your majesty allow me to examine it?\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor handed over the wreath. \"Take it,\" said he, \"but be merciful\r\nto my pretty delinquents.\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz took the flowers and looked at them as he would have done at any\r\nother thing that might be the links in a chain of evidence, and passed\r\nhis slender, white fingers through the long ribbons that fastened them\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\"The lady who threw these flowers is a Pole,\" said he, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that?\" cried the emperor.\r\n\r\n\"It is certainly not accidental that the wreath should be composed of\r\nwhite and red roses, and tied with a knot of white and red ribbons.\r\nWhite and red, you remember, are the colors of the so-called Republic\r\nof Poland.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right!\" exclaimed Joseph, \"and she wears mourning because a\r\nnoble woman must necessarily grieve for the sufferings of her bleeding\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" said Kaunitz, who, meanwhile, was opening the leaves and\r\nsearching among them, \"here is a paper. Does your majesty permit me to\r\ndraw it out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. I gave you the wreath to examine, and you shall have the\r\nbenefit of all that you discover.\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz bowed his thanks, and began to untwist the stems of the flowers.\r\nThe emperor and the two courtiers looked on with interest. The prince\r\ndrew forth a little folded paper, and reached it over to the emperor.\r\n\r\n\"Have the goodness, your majesty, to read it yourself. A declaration of\r\nlove from a lady is not intended for my profane eyes.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor sighed. \"No,\" said he, \"it is no declaration for me. I am\r\nnot so happy. Read, your highness, read it aloud.\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz unfolded the paper, and read. \"Souvenir d'Eperies\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing more?\" asked Joseph.\r\n\r\nKaunitz replied by handing him the note.\r\n\r\n\"How strange! Only these words, and no explanation. I cannot understand\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"These words prove my supposition, your majesty. The donor is a Polish\r\nlady and one of the Confederates.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am convinced of it. When your majesty was travelling in Hungary, did\r\nyou not spend a day at Eperies, and honor the Confederates by receiving\r\nthem both publicly and privately?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" replied Joseph, warmly. \"And it gladdened my heart to assure\r\nthese brave, struggling patriots of my sympathy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did not your majesty go so far as to promise them mediation with\r\nPrussia and Russia?\" [Footnote: Ferrand. vol. i., p. 79.]\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" replied the emperor, with a faint blush.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, this female confederate meant to remind you of your promise\r\non the day when you are to hold a conference with Frederick,\" said\r\nKaunitz, allowing the wreath to slip through his fingers to the floor.\r\n\"There, your majesty,\" continued he, \"your beautiful Pole is at your\r\nfeet. Will you rescue her, or unite in crushing her to the earth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I will rescue her,\" replied Joseph, \"that she may not fall into the\r\nhands of ambitious Catharine. It would give her great pleasure to deck\r\nher Muscovite head with these sweet Polish roses; but she shall not have\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, and before his courtiers could anticipate his action,\r\nthe emperor stooped and picked up the wreath.\r\n\r\n\"Have a care, your majesty,\" said the wary Kaunitz, \"how you espouse\r\nPolish quarrels. The Poles are unlucky. They can die like men, but they\r\ndo not live like men. Beware of Polish roses, for their perfume is not\r\nwholesome.\"\r\n\r\nJust then a shout was heard in the distance, and the emperor hastened to\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\n\"It is the King of Prussia!\" cried he, joyfully, and he walked toward\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nPrince Kaunitz took the liberty of going immediately up and interposing\r\nhis tall person between Joseph and the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty,\" said he, reproachfully, \"what are you about to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am about to go forward to meet the King of Prussia. He is just\r\ndescending from his carriage. Do not detain me,\" replied Joseph,\r\nhastily.\r\n\r\n\"But has your majesty forgotten that at Neisse, when the King of Prussia\r\nwas the host, he came no farther than the stairway to meet you? It is\r\nnot seemly that Austria should condescend to Prussia.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear prince,\" said the emperor, with a peculiar laugh, \"it is your\r\nbusiness to respect these conventions. It is mine to regulate them. As\r\nthe LITTLE sovereign of Austria I hasten to do homage to the GREAT King\r\nof Prussia.\"\r\n\r\nAnd gently putting the minister aside: the emperor walked rapidly out,\r\nfollowed by his suite.\r\n\r\nKaunitz looked after him with stormy brow.\r\n\r\n\"Incorrigible fanatic!\" said he to himself. \"Will you never cease to\r\nbutt your empty head against the wall? You will butt in vain as long as\r\n_I_ have power and life. Go. It befits such a little emperor as you to\r\nhumble yourself before your great king; but Austria is represented in MY\r\nperson, and I remain here!\"\r\n\r\nHe looked around the room, and his eyes fell upon the wreath, which the\r\nemperor had laid by the side of his hat, on the table. A sneer\r\noverspread his countenance as he went toward it, and shook off some of\r\nthe leaves which were already fading.\r\n\r\n\"How soon they fall!\" said he. \"I think that the glorious republic will\r\nbe quite as short-lived as they. Meanwhile I shall see that the\r\n'Souvenir d'Eperies' lives no longer than roses have a right to live.\"\r\n\r\nHe left the room, resolved to find out who it was that had bestowed the\r\nwreath. \"For,\" thought he, \"she may prove a useful instrument with which\r\nto operate on either side.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\nFREDERICK THE GREAT.\r\n\r\nWith youthful ardor, unconscious that his head was uncovered, the\r\nemperor hurried down the staircase into the street. Looking neither to\r\nthe right nor to the left, his eyes fixed upon the spot whence the king\r\nwas advancing, the emperor rushed onward, for the first time in his life\r\nslighting the people who thronged around, full of joy at sight of his\r\nelegant and handsome person.\r\n\r\nFrederick was coming with equal rapidity, and now, in the very centre of\r\nthe square, the monarchs met.\r\n\r\nAt this moment all was quiet. The military, ranged in lines around, were\r\nglistening with gold lace and brightened arms. Behind them came the\r\npeople, who far and near were seen flowing in one great stream toward\r\nthe square, while on the balconies and through the open windows of the\r\nhouses around richly-dressed matrons and beautiful maidens enclosed the\r\nscene, like one long wreath of variegated flowers.\r\n\r\nThey met; and in the joy of his youthful enthusiasm, the emperor threw\r\nhimself into the arms of the King of Prussia, and embraced him with a\r\ntenderness that was almost filial. The king returned the caress, and\r\npressed the young monarch to his heart.\r\n\r\nWhile the King of Prussia had been advancing, the people in silence were\r\nrevolving in their minds the blood, the treasure, the long years of\r\nstruggle which Austrians had owed to this warlike Frederick. But when\r\nthey saw how Joseph greeted him, they forgot every thing, and he now\r\nseemed to their excited imaginations to come like a resplendent sun of\r\npeace, whose rays streamed far into the distance of a happy and\r\nprosperous futurity.\r\n\r\nIt was peace! peace!--the hopes of peace that filled every eye with\r\ntears, and bowed every unconscious knee in prayer to Almighty God.\r\n\r\nFrom the midst of the kneeling multitude, a voice was heard to cry out,\r\n\"Long live peace!\" A thousand other voices echoed the words, \"Long live\r\npeace!\"\r\n\r\n\"Long live the emperor and the king!\" cried the same voice; and now the\r\nair was rent with shouts, while from street and square, and from every\r\nhouse, the cry went up to heaven, \"Long live the emperor! Long live the\r\nking!\"\r\n\r\nFrederick withdrew from Joseph's embrace, and bowed to the multitude\r\nwith that bright and fascinating smile which no one was ever known to\r\nresist.\r\n\r\nHe then turned to the emperor, and presenting the young Prince of\r\nPrussia and the two Princes of Brunswick, he pointed to the white\r\nuniforms which they wore, and said: \"Sire, I bring you some new\r\nrecruits. [Footnote: The king wore the Austrian uniform, embroided with\r\nsilver. The princes and the king's suite also wore it.] We are all\r\ndesirous of serving under your banner. And we feel that it would be an\r\nhonor,\" continued he, looking around the square, \"to be the\r\ncompanions-in-arms of your majesty's soldiers, for each man looks like a\r\ntrue son of Mars.\"\r\n\r\n\"If so,\" replied the emperor, \"they have reason to rejoice, since to-day\r\nthey are permitted, for the first time, to do homage to their father.\"\r\n\r\nFrederick smiled, and taking Joseph's arm, they walked together to the\r\npalace. The king was conducted at once to the apartments prepared for\r\nhis occupation, whence he shortly emerged to join the noble company\r\nassembled in the hall that led into the dining-room.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant suite of the emperor were awaiting the princely pair, and\r\nwhen they entered the hall together, followed by the cortege of Prussia,\r\nevery head bowed with deferential awe, and every eye sought the ground.\r\nOne head only bent slightly, and one pair of eyes looked boldly into the\r\nface of Frederick the Great.\r\n\r\nThe eagle eye of the king remarked him at once, and with an affable\r\nsmile he approached the haughty minister.\r\n\r\n\"I rejoice, at last, to meet Prince Kaunitz face to face,\" said he, in\r\nhis soft and musical voice. \"We need no introduction to one another. I\r\nam not such a barbarian as to require that he should be pointed out to\r\nme whom all Europe knows, admires, and respects.\"\r\n\r\nSomething happened to which Kaunitz was totally unaccustomed--he\r\nblushed. In spite of himself, he smiled and bowed very, very low; but he\r\nfound no words wherewith to reply to Frederick's flattering address.\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" said the emperor, coming to the rescue, \"you are making the most\r\nself-possessed men in Austria grow speechless with ecstasy. Even Kaunitz\r\nis at a loss to answer you; and as for poor De Ligne, he is completely\r\ndazzled. But by an by, he will get accustomed to the sun's splendor, and\r\nthen he will recover his accustomed address.\" [Footnote: The emperor's\r\nwords. \"Conversations with Frederick the Great,\" by Prince de Ligne, p.\r\n11.]\r\n\r\n\"I know him well,\" said Frederick, with another bewitching smile. \"I\r\nhave read your letter to Jean Jacques Rousseau, prince; and I know it to\r\nbe genuine, for it is too beautiful to be a forgery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, sire!\" replied De Ligne, \"I am not of such renown that obscure\r\nwriters should seek to forge my name.\" [Footnote: Not long before this,\r\na letter had been written to Jean Jacques, and signed with the king's\r\nname. The writer of this letter was Horace Walpole.]\r\n\r\nThe king bowed, and turned to Field-Marshal von Lacy.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty need not present this man either,\" said he, laying his hand\r\nupon Lacy's shoulder, \"he has given me entirely too much trouble for me\r\nnot to be familiar with his features. I have good reason to remember Von\r\nLacy, and to rejoice that he is not quartermaster-general to-day; for in\r\nthat capacity, I and my soldiers have suffered enough from him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where is Loudon?\" asked the emperor. \"He is very late to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not his habit,\" replied Frederick, quickly, \"I have seldom been\r\nable to come upon the field as soon as he. But, sire, we have done him\r\ninjustice, for he is here, punctual as though he waited his enemies, not\r\nhis friends.\"\r\n\r\nCrossing over to Loudon, and disregarding his stiff demeanor, Frederick\r\ntook his hand, and greeted him with the most cordial expressions of\r\nregard.\r\n\r\n\"If it be agreeable to your majesty,\" said the emperor, as the doors\r\nwere flung open, \"we will proceed to dinner.\" And he offered his arm.\r\n\r\nFrederick took it, but he still kept his eyes upon Loudon.\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" said he to Joseph, \"if I am to have the honor of sitting beside\r\nyour majesty at the table, pray, let me have Loudon on the other side. I\r\nwould much rather have him there than opposite--I feel safer.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the king walked on, and the company passed into the\r\ndining-room.\r\n\r\n\"If he turns the heads of all the court with his flattery,\" muttered\r\nKaunitz, following just after the princely pair, \"he shall not succeed\r\nwith me. What fine things, to be sure! But flattery indiscriminately\r\nbestowed leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. He wishes Loudon for his\r\nneighbor, forsooth, as if a man could have any rational intercourse with\r\nsuch an ignorant, ill-bred, awkward dolt as he is.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Kaunitz, who was secretly chagrined at the choice of the king, took\r\nthe seat which bad been assigned to him by the emperor. It was at\r\nJoseph's own table, directly opposite the two sovereigns\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Frederick, laughing and nodding to Kaunitz, \"now I am\r\nsatisfied. If I would rather have Loudon beside me, I would rather have\r\nthe greatest statesman in Europe before me, for it is only when I can\r\nsee him that I feel quite safe from his diplomatic grasp. I take shelter\r\nunder your highness's eye. Be indulgent to an old soldier, whose sword\r\nhas so often been struck from his hands by your magic pen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty's pen is as sharp as your sword,\" replied Kaunitz, \"and\r\nthe world has learned to fear and admire the one as much as the other.\r\nWe offer resistance to neither; but pay willing homage to the prince who\r\nis at once a statesman, an author, and a warrior.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor whispered to Frederick: \"Sire, a compliment from Kaunitz is\r\nlike the flower upon the aloe-it blooms once in a century.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI.\r\n\r\nTHE PRIMA DONNA.\r\n\r\nThe festivities of the first day were concluded with a ballet. Great\r\npreparations had been made for the reception of the King of Prussia.\r\nNoverre with his dancers, and Florian Gassman with his opera corps had\r\nbeen summoned to Neustadt. They came in twenty wagons laden with\r\nscenery, coulisses, machinery, and costumes, all of which was intended\r\nto prove to Frederick that, although the court of Berlin was the\r\nacknowledged seat of literature and the fine arts, Vienna was not\r\naltogether forsaken by the Muses.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty must be indulgent to our theatrical efforts,\" said the\r\nemperor, as they took their seats in the box which had been prepared for\r\ntheir occupation. \"We all know that in Berlin the Muses and Graces have\r\ntheir home; they seldom visit Vienna, for they are loyal and love to sit\r\nat the feet of their master.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, sire, you speak of the past. Time was when the Muses were not\r\nunpropitious; but now that I am an old man, they have proved inconstant,\r\nand have fled from Sans-Souci forever. The Muses themselves are young,\r\nand it is but natural that they should seek your majesty's protection. I\r\nam thankful through your intervention, to be admitted once more to\r\nParnassus.\"\r\n\r\nJust as the king was about to seat himself he remarked Kaunitz, who,\r\nwith his usual grave indifference, was advancing to a chair not far off.\r\n\r\nFrederick turned smilingly to Joseph. \"Your majesty and I,\" said he,\r\n\"might stand to-night as representatives of youthful and aged\r\nsovereignty. We both need wisdom in our councils. Let us invite Prince\r\nKaunitz to sit between us.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor bowed, and beckoned to the prince, who, having heard\r\ndistinctly what had been intended for his ears, could not suppress a\r\nmomentary expression of exultation. Never in his life bad lie made a bow\r\nso profound as that with which he took the seat which a king had\r\nresigned to him. He was so exultant that in the course of the evening he\r\nwas actually heard to laugh. The ballet began. Gods and goddesses\r\nfluttered about the stage, Muses and Graces grouped themselves together\r\nin attitudes of surpassing beauty; and finally, with one grand tableau,\r\ncomposed of all the dancers, the curtain fell.\r\n\r\nAfter the ballet came a concert. It was to open with an air from Gluck's\r\nopera of \"Alceste,\" sung in costume by the celebrated Bernasconi.\r\n\r\nThe orchestra played the introduction, and the curtain rose but the\r\nprima donna did not appear. The leader looked toward the coulisses, but\r\nin vain; and the audience began to express their impatience in audible\r\nmurmurs.\r\n\r\nThe curtain fell slowly, and the marshal of the emperor's household,\r\ncoming forward, spoke a few words to Joseph, in a low voice.\r\n\r\nHe turned to the king. \"Sire, I have to apologize to you for this\r\nunlucky contretemps. Signora Bernasconi has been taken suddenly sick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" replied Frederick, laughing, \"I am quite au fait to the sudden\r\nillness of prima donnas. But since I have ordered a half month's salary\r\nto be withdrawn from every singer who falls sick on a night of\r\nrepresentation, my cantatrices at Berlin enjoy unprecedented health.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bernasconi must have been made sick by her anxiety to appear well in\r\nyour majesty's critical eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not believe it. These princesses of the stage are more capricious\r\nthan veritable princesses. Above all, the Italians.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Bernasconi,\" said Kaunitz, \"is not an Italian. She belongs to a\r\nnoble Polish family.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the worse,\" laughed Frederick. \"That Polish blood is forever\r\nboiling over. I am surprised that your highness should permit your\r\ndirector to give to a Polish woman a role of importance. Wherever the\r\nPoles go, they bring trouble and strife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps so, sire,\" replied Kaunitz; \"but they are excellent actors, and\r\nno people understand better how to represent heroes.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this, Kaunitz drew out his jewelled snuff-box, enriched with\r\na medallion portrait of his imperial mistress, Maria Theresa.\r\n\r\n\"To represent heroes, I grant you; but just as we are beginning to feel\r\nan interest in the spectacle of their heroism, To the stage-armor falls\r\noff, the tin sword rattles, and we find that we were wasting our\r\nsympathies upon a band of play-actors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said Kaunitz, as he dipped his long, white fingers into the\r\nsnuff-box, \"perhaps we may live to see the stage break under them, and\r\nthen they may cease to be actors, and become lunatics.\"\r\n\r\nFrederick's eagle eyes were fixed upon Kaunitz while he spoke, but the\r\nminister still continued to play with his snuff-box.\r\n\r\n\"Prince,\" said he, laughing, \"we have been antagonists for so many years\r\nthat we must celebrate our first meeting by a pledge of future\r\ngood-will. The Indians are accustomed at such times to smoke the calumet\r\nof peace. Here we have tobacco under another form. Will you allow me a\r\npinch from your snuff-box?\"\r\n\r\nThis was a token of such great condescension that even the haughty\r\nKaunitz was seen to blush with gratified vanity. With unusual eagerness,\r\nhe presented his snuff-box to the king.\r\n\r\nThe king took the snuff and as he did so, remarked, \"This is the first\r\ntime I have ever taken snuff from another man's box.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your majesty,\" replied Kaunitz, quickly. \"Silesia was a\r\npinch from our snuff-box.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said Frederick, laughing, \"but the tobacco was so strong that it\r\nhas cost me many an uncomfortable sneeze; and nobody as ever been civil\r\nenough to say, `Heaven bless you.'\"\r\n\r\nWhile the king and Kaunitz jested together, Signor Tobaldi had been\r\nsinging his aria; and now that he ceased, Frederick, for the first time,\r\nbecame aware that any music had been going on.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty,\" said the emperor, \"has done injustice, for once, to a\r\nprima donna. Bernasconi is really sick, but she has sent a substitute.\"\r\n\r\n\"These substitutes,\" said Frederick, \"are always on the look-out for\r\nsuch opportunities of sliding into notice; but unhappily they are not\r\noften equal to the tasks they are so eager to perform.\"\r\n\r\n\"This substitute,\" said Joseph, \"is no rival opera-singer. She is a dear\r\nfriend of Bernasconi's, who speaks of her singing with enthusiasm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that possible? Does one singer go into raptures over another? By all\r\nmeans let us hear the phoenix.\"\r\n\r\nThe king looked toward the stage, and his countenance assumed at once an\r\nexpression of genuine interest.\r\n\r\nOnce more the orchestra began the introduction to Gluck's beautiful\r\naria. Meanwhile a tall and elegant person was seen to advance toward the\r\nfoot-lights. Her pure Grecian robe, half covered with a mantle of purple\r\nvelvet, richly embroidered in gold, fell in graceful folds froth her\r\nsnowy shoulders. Her dark hair, worn in the Grecian style, was confined\r\nby a diadem of brilliants; and the short, white tunic which she wore\r\nunder her mantle, was fastened by a girdle blazing with jewels.\r\n\r\nShe was so transcendently beautiful that Frederick could not resist the\r\ntemptation of joining in the applause which greeted her entrance. She\r\nseemed unconscious of the effect she produced, so earnestly and\r\nanxiously were her large, lustrous eyes fixed upon the spot where\r\nFrederick and Joseph were sitting together. She raised her graceful arms\r\nas she began the prayer of Alceste; but her looks were riveted upon the\r\nsovereigns, who represent divinity on earth. When she sang, the tones of\r\nher glorious voice sank deep into the hearts of all who listened. Now it\r\nwas clear, pure, and vibrating, wooing the air like a clarionet--now it\r\ncaressed the ear like a speaking violin--and upon it poured forth\r\nvolumes of harmony that filled all space, as the the booming organ fills\r\nthe aisles of a vast and lofty cathedral. Gluck, the hypercritical\r\nGluck, would have been ravished to hear his music as she sang it; and\r\nFrederick, who, up to this hour, had refused to acknowledge the genius\r\nof the great German, now sat breathless with rapture, as he listened to\r\nsuch music and such interpretation of music as never had been heard\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Joseph was unmindful of it all. He had a vague idea of\r\ncelestial sounds that seemed to drown him in an ocean of melody; but he\r\nheard not a note of Alceste's prayer. Every sense was stunned save\r\none--and that one was sight.\r\n\r\n\"It is she,\" murmured he, as the siren ceased to sing: \"it is she, the\r\nbeautiful Pole. How resplendent she is to-night!\" Then turning to\r\nKaunitz, whose observing eyes bad been watching his face and whose sharp\r\nears had caught his words, he whispered:\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember the bouquet that was thrown to me this morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"I forget nothing your majesty deigns to communicate to me,\" replied\r\nKaunitz.\r\n\r\n\"This is she. Who can she be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Kaunitz, slightly elevating his eyebrows. \"The 'Souvenir\r\nd'Eperies.' Now I comprehend Bernasconi's illness. She felt ill through\r\npatriotism, that this adroit countrywoman of hers might have the\r\nopportunity of being remarked by your majesty. I would not be at all\r\nsurprised if she went out of the way of prima donnas to attract your\r\nmajesty's attention. These Polish women are fanatics in their love of\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor said nothing in reply. He scarcely listened. His eyes were\r\nstill upon the descending curtain that hid the mysterious beauty from\r\nhis sight. If her object had been to attract him, she had certainly\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\nThe audience were waiting for some signal from either Joseph or\r\nFrederick that they might give vent to their admiration. The king\r\nunderstood the general feeling, and began to applaud with his hands. In\r\na moment the applause became vociferous, and it did not cease until the\r\ncurtain drew up a second time, and the prima donna came forward to\r\nreceive her ovation.\r\n\r\nFor one moment they surveyed the enchanting singer, and then broke out\r\ninto another wild storm, in which the emperor joined so heartily that\r\nhis voice was heard above the din, crying out, \"Brava! bravissima!\"\r\n\r\nThe singer sought his glance, and meeting it, blushed deeply. Then,\r\ncoming forward a few steps, she began once more to sing.\r\n\r\nHer song was a passionate appeal to the two princes, whom she addressed\r\nopenly, in behalf of Poland.\r\n\r\nIt was over, and not a sound was heard in the theatre. The audience\r\nhung, in breathless anxiety, upon the verdict that must come from those\r\nwho had been addressed. They were so intent upon Frederick and Joseph\r\nthat they did not see the singer leave the stage. They were not\r\ndestined, however, to be enlightened or relieved, for no demonstration\r\nwas made in the imperial box.\r\n\r\nBut Joseph, rising from his seat, signed to the marshal of the household\r\nto approach.\r\n\r\n\"Go, count,\" said he, \"go quickly, and ask her name. Tell her it is the\r\nemperor who desires to know her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Her name is Poland,\" said Kaunitz, in an absent tone. Then, addressing\r\nJoseph, he continued: \"Did I not tell your majesty that your adventure\r\nwas not to end with the throwing of a bouquet? I know these Polish\r\nwomen; they coquette with every thing--above all, with the throes of\r\ntheir dying fatherland.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor smiled, but said nothing. He was watching the return of the\r\nmarshal of the household.\r\n\r\n\"Well, count, what is her name?\" cried he earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"Sire, I am unable to find it out. The lady has left the theatre, and no\r\none here, not even the director, knows her name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange,\" said the emperor. \"Let a messenger, then, be sent to\r\nBernasconi: she, of course, must know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your majesty, I have been to Bernasconi. She is here,\r\npreparing to sing her second air. She has suddenly recovered and will\r\nhave the honor of appearing before your majesties in a few moments.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what said Bernasconi of the Polish singer?\"\r\n\r\n\"She does not know her name, your majesty. She showed me a letter from\r\nColonel Dumourriez, the French plenipotentiary to the Polish Republic.\r\nHe designates her only as a Polish lady of noble birth, whose remarkable\r\nvocal powers were worthy of your majesty's admiration.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear that?\" said Frederick to Kaunitz. \"Do you hear that? The\r\nFrench plenipotentiary sends this prima donna to sing before the\r\nemperor. Vraiment, it seems that France is disgusted with war, and\r\nintends to try her hand at sentiment. Petticoat-government is so\r\nsecurely established there, that I suppose the French are about to throw\r\na petticoat over the heads of their allies. France and Poland are two\r\nfevimes galantes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire,\" replied Kaunitz, \"but one of them is old and ugly. Lindaine\r\nLa Pologne is an old coquette, who puts on youthful airs, and thinks she\r\nhides her wrinkles with paint.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does your highness, then, believe that her youth is forever past? Can\r\nshe never be rejuvenated?\" asked Frederick, with a searching look at\r\nKaunitz's marble features.\r\n\r\n\"Sire, people who waste their youth in dissipation and rioting, have no\r\nstrength when the day of real warfare dawns.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it would seem that the Empress of Russia has some intention of\r\nmaking a serious attack upon the poor old lady,\" said Frederick, while\r\nfor the second time he took a pinch from the snuff-box of the crafty\r\nAustrian.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the concert was going on. Bernasconi, completely restored,\r\nsang the beautiful air from \"Orpheus and Eurydice,\" and Frederick\r\napplauded as before. But the emperor sat silent and abstracted. His\r\nthoughts were with that Polish woman, whose love of country had brought\r\nher to Neustadt to remind him of the promises he had made to the\r\nConfederates at Eperies.\r\n\r\n\"How enthusiastically she loves Poland!\" said he to himself. \"She will\r\nof course find means to cross my path again, for she seeks to interest\r\nme in the fate of her fatherland. The next time she comes, I will do\r\nlike the prince in the fairy-tale, I will strew pitch upon the\r\nthreshold, that she may not be able to escape from me again.\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz, too, was preoccupied with thoughts of the bewitching\r\nConfederate, but the fact that she would be sure to come again was not\r\nquite so consoling to him as to Joseph.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he returned home, he called for his private secretary, who\r\nwas one of the most dexterous detectives in Vienna.\r\n\r\n\"You will make inquiries at once as to the whereabout of the prima donna\r\nwho sang before me and their majesties to-night. Tomorrow at nine\r\no'clock I must know who she is, where she lodges, and what is her\r\nbusiness here.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER, LXII.\r\n\r\nFREDERICK THE GREAT AND PRINCE KAUNITZ.\r\n\r\nThe great review, which had been gotten up in honor of the King of\r\nPrussia, was over. In this review Frederick had become acquainted with\r\nthe strength of the Austrian army, the superiority of its cavalry, and\r\nthe military capacity of the emperor who was its commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nThe king had been loud in his praises of all three, and had embraced the\r\nemperor in presence of the whole army.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the review, Frederick sent a page to announce to\r\nPrince Kaunitz that he woud be glad to see him in his own private\r\napartments.\r\n\r\nKaunitz at once declared his readiness to wait upon the king, and to the\r\nunspeakable astonishment of his valet, had actually shortened his toilet\r\nand had betrayed some indifference to the arrangement of his peruke. As\r\nhe left the room, his gait was elastic and active, and his countenance\r\nbore visible marks of the excitement with which he was looking forward\r\nto the coming interview.\r\n\r\nBut Kaunitz himself became suddenly aware of all this, and he set to\r\nwork to force back his emotion. The nearer he came to the king's suite\r\nof rooms, the slower became his step and the calmer his mien. At last it\r\nwas tranquillized, and the minister looked almost as cold and\r\nindifferent as ever.\r\n\r\nArrived at the door of the antechamber, he looked around, and having\r\nconvinced himself that no one was in sight, he drew from his\r\nbreast-pocket a small mirror which he always wore about his person.\r\nSharply he viewed himself therein, until gradually, as he looked, his\r\nface resumed the stony aspect which like a thickening haze concealed his\r\nemotions from other men's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"It is really not worth my while,\" thought he, \"to get up an excitement\r\nbecause I am about to have a conference with that small bit of royalty,\r\nFrederick. If he should discover it, he might suppose that I, like the\r\nrest of the world, am abashed in the presence of a king because he has\r\nsome military fame. No--no--what excites me is the fact that I am about\r\nto write a bit of history; for this interview between Prussia and\r\nAustria will be historical. It is the fate of Europe--that fate which I\r\nhold in my hands, that stirs me with such unwonted emotion. This King of\r\nPrussia has nothing to do with it. No doubt he hopes to hoodwink me with\r\nflattery, but I shall work him to my ends, and force him to that line of\r\npolicy which I have long ago laid down for Austria's welfare.\"\r\n\r\nHere the mirror was returned to his pocket, and he opened the door of\r\nthe anteroom. The sweet sounds of a flute broke in upon his ear as he\r\nentered. The king's aide-de-camp came up and whispered that his\r\nsovereign was accustomed to play on the flute daily, and that he never\r\nfailed even when in camp to solace his solitude with music.\r\n\r\nPrince Kaunitz answered with a shrug, and pointing to the door, said,\r\n\"Announce me to his majesty.\"\r\n\r\nThe aide-de-camp opened the door and announced his highness Prince\r\nKaunitz.\r\n\r\nThe flute ceased, and the rich, musical voice of Frederick was heard to\r\nsay, \"He can enter.\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz was not much pleased to receive a permission where he fancied\r\nhimself entitled to an invitation; but he had no alternative, so he\r\nwalked languidly forward while the officer held the door open.\r\n\r\n\"Shut the door, and admit no one during the visit of Prince Kaunitz,\"\r\nsaid the king. Then turning to the prince, he pointed to his flute. \"I\r\nsuspect you are amused to see such an old fellow as I coquetting with\r\nthe fine arts; but I assure you that my flute is one of my trustiest\r\nfriends. She has never deceived me, and keeps my secrets faithfully. My\r\nalliance with her is for life. Ask her, and she will tell you that we\r\nlive on terms of truest friendship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unhappily, I do not understand the language of your lady-love. Your\r\nmajesty will perhaps allow me to turn my attention to another one of\r\nyour feminine allies, toward whom I shall venture to question your\r\nmajesty's good faith.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of what lady do you speak?\" cried Frederick, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Of the Empress Catharine,\" replied Kaunitz, slightly inclining his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said the king, laughing, \"you dart like an arrow to the point, and\r\ntransfix me at once upon the barb of politics. Let us sit down, then.\r\nThe arm-chair which you are taking now, may boast hereater that it is\r\nthe courser which has carried the greatest statesman in Europe to a\r\nfield where he is sure to win new victories.\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz was careful to seat himself at the same time as the king, and\r\nthey both sat before a table covered with charts, papers, and books.\r\n\r\nA short pause ensued. Both were collecting their energies for the\r\nstrife. The king, with his eagle eye, gazed upon the face of the astute\r\ndiplomatist while he, pretending not to see it, looked perfectly\r\noblivious of kings or emperors.\r\n\r\n\"So you will ask of Catharine whether I am a loyal ally or not'!\" asked\r\nthe king at last.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire, for unluckily the Empress of Russia is the one who can give\r\nme information.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why unluckily?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I grieve to see that a German prince is willing to form\r\nalliances with her, who, if she could, would bring all Europe under her\r\nyoke, and make every European sovereign her vassal. Russia grows hourly\r\nmore dangerous and more grasping. She foments discord and incites wars,\r\nfor she finds her fortune in the dissensions of other nations, and at\r\nevery misunderstanding between other powers, she makes a step toward the\r\ngoal whither she travels.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is that goal?\"\r\n\r\n\"The subjugation of all Europe,\" cried Kaunitz, with unusual warmth.\"\r\nRussia's policy is that of unprincipled ambition; and if so far she has\r\nnot progressed in her lust of dominion, it is Austria, or rather the\r\npolicy which I dictate to Austria, that has checked her advance. It is I\r\nwho have restored the balance of power, by conquering Austria's\r\nantipathy to France, by isolating haughty England, and hunting all\r\nEurope against rapacious Russia. But Russia never loses sight of the\r\npolicy initiated by Peter the Great; and as I have stemmed the tide of\r\nher aggression toward the west, it is overflowing toward the south and\r\nthe east. All, justice disregarding. Russian armies occupy Poland; and\r\nbefore long the ships of Russia will swarm in the Black Sea and threaten\r\nConstantinople. Russia is perforce a robber, for she is internally\r\nexhausted, and unless she seeks new ports for her commerce, and new\r\nsources of revenue, she is ruined.\"\r\n\r\n\"You err, I assure you,\" cried Frederick, eagerly. \"Russia is in a\r\ncondition to sustain any burden; her revenues this year show an increase\r\nover the last of five hundred thousand rubles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then this increase comes probably from the million of subsidy which\r\nyour majesty has agreed to pay to Russia,\" said Kaunitz, bowing.\r\n[Footnote: Ferrand, \"History of the Dismemberment of Poland,\" vol. i.,\r\np. 84.] \"Such rich tribute may well give her strength to attempt any\r\nthing; but every thaler which your majesty pays into her treasury is a\r\nfirebrand which will one day consume all Europe. If indeed, as you say,\r\nRussia is strong and formidable, it is for your majesty to hold her in\r\ncheck; if she is exhausted, her alliance is not worth having.\"\r\n[Footnote: Kaunitz's own words. Ferrand, vol. i., p. 108.]\r\n\r\n\"Your highness seems eager to have me break off my connection with\r\nRussia,\" said the king, while a cloud passed over his face. \"You wish to\r\nprove that Russia is a power whose friendship is worthless and whose\r\nenmity is to be despised. And yet it is well known to me how zealously\r\nthe Austrian ambassador was intriguing not long ago to induce Russia to\r\ncast me aside and enter into an alliance with you. Your highness must\r\nexcuse me if I throw aside the double-edged blade of courtly\r\ndissimulation. I am an old soldier and my tongue refuses to utter any\r\nthing but unvarnished truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"If your majesty permits,\" replied Kaunitz with some warmth, \"I, too,\r\nwill speak the unvarnished truth. You are pleased to charge me with\r\nseeking to alienate Russia from Prussia while striving to promote an\r\nalliance of the former with Austria. Will your majesty allow me to reply\r\nto this accusation in full without interruption?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" replied Frederick, nodding his head. \"Speak on, I shall not\r\nput in a word.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII.\r\n\r\nRUSSIA A FOE TO ALL EUROPE.\r\n\r\nPrince Kaunitz remained silent for a time, as though he were turning\r\nover in his mind what he should say to the king. Then slowly raising his\r\nhead, he met the scrutinizing glance of Frederick with perfect\r\ncomposure, and spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\"At the conclusion of the unhappy war which desolated both Austria and\r\nPrussia, I had to consider what course for the future was likely to\r\nrecuperate the prostrate energies of Austria. I resolved in my mind\r\nvarious schemes, and laid them before her imperial majesty. The one\r\nwhich I advocated and which was adopted by the empress, had mainly for\r\nits object the pacification of all European broils, and the restoration\r\nof the various Austrian dependencies to order and prosperity. For some\r\ntime I waited to see whether your majesty would not seek to conciliate\r\nFrance, and renew your old league of friendship with her king. But the\r\npolicy pursued by your majesty at the court of Russia convinced me that\r\nyou were thinking exclusively of securing your provinces in the east.\r\nThis once understood, it became the interest of Austria to rivet the\r\nlinks which bound her to France; for an alliance with her offered the\r\nsame advantages to us as that of Russia did to Prussia. Moreover, it was\r\nAustria's opinion that Prussia was now too closely bound to Russia for\r\nher ever to seek an alliance with France. It therefore appeared that our\r\ngood understanding with the latter would conduce to preserve the balance\r\nof power among European nations, and that it would meet with the favor\r\nof all those potentates who were anxious for peace. It follows thence\r\nthat the court of Vienna is perfectly content with her relations toward\r\nFrance; and I expressly and distinctly declare to your majesty that we\r\nnever will seek to alienate Russia from Prussia, that we never will\r\nencourage any advances from Russia, and that your majesty may rest\r\nassured that we never will deviate from our present line of policy. This\r\nwas what I desired to explain, and I thank your majesty for the courtesy\r\nwith which You have listened to me.\" [Footnote: This discourse of Kannitz is\r\nhistorical. It is found in Ferrand's \"Histoire des Trois Demembrements\r\nde la Pologue,\" vol. i., p. 112.]\r\n\r\nThe face of the king, which at first had looked distrustful, was now\r\nentirely free from suspicion. He rose from his chair, and giving his\r\nhand to Kaunitz, said with a cordial smile\r\n\r\n\"This is what I call noble and candid statesmanship. You have not spoken\r\nas a diplomatist, but as a great minister, who, feeling his strength,\r\nhas no reason to conceal his actions. I will answer in the same spirit.\r\nSit down again and hear me. You fear Russia, and think that if she gains\r\ntoo great an ascendency among nations, she will use it to the detriment\r\nof all Europe. I agree with you, and I myself would view the\r\naggrandizement of Russia under Catharine with disapprobation and\r\ndistrust. You are right, and I feel the embarrassment of my present\r\npolitical condition. At the commencement of this Turkish war, I would\r\nhave used my honest endeavors to check the usurping advances of Russia,\r\nnot only in Turkey but also in Poland. But I myself was in a critical\r\nposition. You, who had been represented to me as the most rapacious of\r\ndiplomatists, you had prejudiced all Europe against me, so that for\r\nseven long years my only allies were my rights and my good sword. The\r\nonly hand reached out to me was that of Russia; policy constrained me to\r\ngrasp and retain it. It is both to my honor and my interest that I keep\r\nfaith with Russia,, and eschew all shifts and tergiversations in my\r\ndealings with her. Her alliance is advantageous to Prussia, and\r\ntherefore I pay her large subsidies, give her advice, allow my officers\r\nto enlist in her armies, and finally I have promised the empress that\r\nshould Austria interfere in behalf of the Turks, I will use all my\r\ninfluence to mediate between you.\" [Footnote: Dolan. \"Memoirs of My\r\nTimes,\" vol. i., p. 458.]\r\n\r\n\"Does that mean that if Russia and Austria should go to war, your\r\nmajesty will stand by the former?\"\r\n\r\n\"It means that I will make every effort to prevent a war between Russia\r\nand Austria. If, in spite of all that I could do, there should be war\r\nbetween you, it would not be possible for Prussia to remain neutral.\r\nWere she to do so, she would deserve the contempt both of friend and\r\nfoe. I would fulfil my obligations to Russia, that I might secure the\r\nduration of our alliance. But I sincerely hope that it may be my good\r\nfortune to mediate with such results as will spare me the espousal of\r\neither party's quarrel.\"\r\n\r\n\"If so, Russia must abandon her ambitious projects in Turkey, and she\r\nmust speedily consent to secure peace to Poland,\" replied Kaunitz\r\nwarmly.\r\n\r\nThe king smiled, and taking from the table a sealed packet, he presented\r\nit to Kaunitz.\r\n\r\n\"A letter for me!\" exclaimed the minister, surprised.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your highness. A few moments before you came hither, a courier\r\narrived from Constantinople with dispatches for you and for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does your majesty allow me to open them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I request you to read them while I read mine, Which are, as yet,\r\nunopened. I have only read the report of my ambassador at\r\nConstantinople. Let us see what news we have.\"\r\n\r\nThe king, with a smiling inclination of the head, settled himself in his\r\narm-chair, and began to read.\r\n\r\nA long pause ensued. Both tried to seem absorbed in the dispatches from\r\nTurkey, yet each one gave now and then a hasty, furtive glance at the\r\nother. If their eyes met, they were quickly cast, down again, and so\r\nthey continued to watch and read; until there was no more excuse for\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\"Bad news from Turkey,\" said Frederick, speaking first, and putting down\r\nhis letters.\r\n\r\n\"The Porte has been unfortunate,\" said Kaunitz, shrugging his shoulders\r\nand looking perfectly indifferent. \"Russia has not only gained a great\r\nvictory on land, but has defeated him at sea, and has burnt his fleet.\"\r\n\r\n\"The consequence of all this is, that Turkey now turns to Austria and\r\nPrussia for help, \"replied the king.\" Upon our intervention now, hangs\r\nthe peace of all Europe. We have a most important mission to perform.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty intends to undertake it?\" asked Kaunitz carelessly.\r\n\r\n\"I am resolved to do all that I can to prevent war. It is such a\r\nterrible scourge, that no nation has a right to fold her hands and see\r\nits horrors, if by any step of hers it can be averted or stopped. Turkey\r\nasks for intervention, that she may be restored to the blessings of\r\npeace. Shall we refuse her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Austria cannot mediate in this affair unless Russia first proposes it,\"\r\nsaid Kaunitz, in a listless tone. \"The court of Vienna cannot make\r\npropositions to Russia. It therefore rests with your majesty to induce\r\nthe Empress Catharine to make the same request of Austria, as Turkey has\r\nmade of us both.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will propose it to the empress,\" said the king eagerly; \"and I feel\r\nsure that she will agree to do so.\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz bowed loftily. \"Then,\" replied he, \"Austria will mediate; but\r\nlet it be understood that the peace is to be an honorable one for\r\nTurkey, and that Russia ceases any further aggression in that quarter.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Porte will be under the necessity of making some concessions,\" said\r\nthe king, \"since he it is whose arms have sustained reverses. But Turkey\r\nmay still remain a second-rate power, for I think that Russia will be\r\nsatisfied with the Crimea and the Black Sea for herself and a guaranty\r\nof independent sovereigns for Wallachia and Moldavia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Independent princes appointed by Russia!\" cried Kaunitz.\r\n\r\n\"My imperial sovereign will never consent to have a Russian province\r\ncontiguous to Austria; and should Moldavia and Wallachia be governed by\r\nhospodars and petty despots, their pretended independence would soon\r\nmelt away into a Russian dependency. Austria, too, would esteem it a\r\ngreat misfortune if Russia should come into possession of the Crimea and\r\nthe Black Sea. Her dominion over the Black Sea would be more dangerous\r\nto Europe than an extension of her territory. Nothing, in short, would\r\nbe so fatal to that independence which is dear to all nations, as the\r\ncession of this important outlet to Russia.\" [Footnote: The prince's\r\nown words. Ferrand, i., p. 112.\r\n\r\n\"Your highness may be right,\" said the king; \"and Austria has more to\r\nfear from this dominion than Prussia; for the Danube is a finger of the\r\nBlack Sea, which might be used to seize some of your fairest provinces.\r\nWe will keep this in view when we enter upon our negotiations with\r\nRussia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before we begin them at all, we must exact of Russia to restore peace\r\nto Poland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ali, you wish to draw Poland info the circle of intervention?\" said\r\nFrederick, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"The court of Vienna cannot suffer Russia to oppress this unfortunate\r\npeople as she has hitherto done. Not only has she forced Stan islaus\r\nAugustus upon them, but she has also compelled them to alter their\r\nconstitution, and, in the face of all justice, her armies occupy Poland,\r\ndevastating the country, and oppressing both royalists and\r\nrepublicans.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are resolved to speak of Poland,\" said Frederick, again taking so\r\nlarge a pinch of snuff that it bedaubed not only his face, but his white\r\nAustrian uniform. He brushed it off with his fingers, and shaking his\r\nhead, said: \"I am not neat enough to wear this elegant dress. I am not\r\nworthy of wearing the Austrian livery.\" He then resumed: \"You interest\r\nyourself in Poland. I thought that Polish independence had been thrown\r\nto the winds. I thought, also, that your highness was of the same\r\nopinion on this question as the Empress Catharine, who says that she\r\nneither knows where Polish territory begins nor where it ends. Now I am\r\nequally at a loss to know what is and what is not Poland, for in Warsaw\r\na Russian army seems to be perfectly at home, and in the south of Poland\r\nan Austrian regiment affirms that they occupy Polish ground by command\r\nof the Austrian government.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty is pleased to speak of the county of Zips. Zips has always\r\nbelonged to Hungary. It was mortgaged by the Emperor Sigismund to his\r\nbrother-in-law ZVladislaw Jagello for a sum of money. Hungary has never\r\nparted with her right to this country; and, as we have been compelled to\r\nsend troops to our frontier to watch Russia, the opportunity presents\r\nitself for us to demonstrate to Poland that Austria can never consent to\r\nregard a mortgaged province as one either given or sold. Zips belongs to\r\nAustria, and we will pay back to the King of Poland the sum for which it\r\nwas mortgaged. That is all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but it will be difficult not only for Poland, but for all Europe,\r\nwhich is accustomed to consider Zips as Polish territory, to remember\r\nyour highness's new boundaries. I, for my part, do not understand it,\r\nand I will be much obliged to you if, according to your new order of\r\nthings, you will show the where Hungary ends and Poland begins.\"\r\n[Footnote: The kng's own words. Ferrand, P. 112.]\r\n\r\n\"Where the county of Zips ends, and where the boundaries of Hungary\r\nbegan in olden times, there the line that separates Austria from Poland\r\nshould be drawn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" sighed the king, \"you speak of the olden time. But we must settle\r\nall these things now with regard to the present. I happen, by chance, to\r\nhave a rnah of Poland on my table. Oblige me now by showing me Poland as\r\nyour highness understands its boundaries.\"\r\n\r\nThe king stood up, and unfolding a map, laid it on the table. Kaunitz\r\nalso rose, and stood on the opposite side. \"Now,\" said Frederick, \"let\r\nme see the county of Zips.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE MAP OF POLAND.\r\n\r\n\"HERE, your majesty, is Zips,\" said Kaunitz, as he passed his delicate\r\nwhite finger over the lower part of the map.\r\n\r\nThe king leaned over, and looked thoughtfully at the moving finger. For\r\nsome time he kept silence. Then he raised his head, and suet the gaze of\r\nthe prince.\r\n\r\n\"A very pretty piece of land which Austria takes from her neighbor,\" said\r\nhe, with a piercing glance at Kaunitz. \"Austria takes nothing from her\r\nneighbor, sire, except that which belongs to her,\" replied Kaunitz,\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\n\"How very fortunate it is that this particular piece of land should\r\nbelong to Austria!\" said the king; with a slight sneer. \"You see that\r\nPoland, who for so many centuries had supposed herself to be the\r\nrightful owner of the Zips, has, in virtue of such ownership, projected\r\nbeyond the Carpathian Mountains quite to the interior of Hungary. Now a\r\nwedge of that sort is inconvenient, perhaps dangerous, and it is lucky\r\nfor Austria that she has found out her right of possession in that\r\nquarter. It not only contracts her neighbor's domains, but essentially\r\nincreases her own. It now concerns Austria to prove to Europe her right\r\nto this annexation, for Europe is somewhat astonished to hear of it. \"\r\n\r\n\"In the court-chancery, at Vienna, are the documents to prove that the\r\nZips was mortgaged by the Emperor Sigismund to his brother-in-law\r\nWladislaw, in the year 1412, for the sum of thirty-seven thousand\r\ngroschen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since 1412!\" cried Frederick. \"Three hundred and fifty-five years'\r\npossession on the part of Poland has not invalidated the title of\r\nAustria to the Zips! My lawful claim to Silesia was of more modern date\r\nthan this, and yet Austria would have made it appear that it was\r\nsuperannuated.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty has proved, conclusively, that it was not so,\" replied\r\nKaunitz, with a slight inclination of the head.\r\n\r\n\"Will Austria take the course which I pursued to vindicate my right?\"\r\nasked the king, quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Stanislaus will not allow us to proceed to extremities,\" replied the\r\nPrince. \"True, he complained at first, and wrote to the empress-queen to\r\ndemand what he called justice.\"\r\n\r\n\"And will your highness inform me what the empress-queen replied in\r\nanswer to these demands?\"\r\n\r\n\"She wrote to the King of Poland that the time had arrived when it\r\nbecame incumbent upon her to derive the boundaries of her empire. That,\r\nin her annexation of the Zips to Austria, she was actuated, not by any\r\nlust of territorial aggrandizement, but by a conviction of her just and\r\ninalienable rights. She was prepared, not only to assert, but to defend\r\nthem; and she took this opportunity to define the lines of her frontier,\r\nfor the reason that Poland was in a state of internal warfare, the end\r\nof which no man could foresee.\" [Footnote: Ferrand, i., p. 94.]\r\n\r\n\"If I were King of Poland, such plain language as this would put me on\r\nmy guard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, if you were King of Poland, no foreign power would employ such\r\nlanguage toward you,\" said Kaunitz, with a half smile.\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" replied the king, shaking his head. \"The King of Poland\r\nis a weak, good-natured fellow. He cannot forget that he has been the\r\nlover of Catharine of Russia, and I verily believe, that if she were to\r\nmake a sign, he would lay, not only himself, but all Poland, at her\r\nfeet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Austria would never suffer her to accept it,\" cried Kauuitz.\r\n\r\nThe king shrugged his shoulders. \"And yet, it would appear that when\r\nZips lay at her feet, the Empress of Austria was ready to embrace it.\r\nBut everybody grows eccentric when Poland is in question. My brother\r\nHenry, who is in St. Petersburg, was one day discussing this matter of\r\nthe annexation of Zips with the empress. As Catharine, like myself, has\r\nnever had the privilege of examining the records in the court of\r\nchancery at Vienna, she expressed some doubt as to the justice of\r\nAustria's appropriation in that quarter. 'It seems,' said she, 'as if\r\none had noting to do but stoop down to pick up something in\r\nPoland.'[Footnote: Ruthfore's \"History of Poland,\" vol. iv., p. 210.]\r\nNow, when proud Austria and her lofty Kaunitz condescend to stoop and\r\npick up, why shall not other people follow their example? I, too, shall\r\nbe obliged to march my troops into Poland, for every misfortune seems\r\nabout to visit this unhappy land. Who knows that in the archives at\r\nBerlin there may not be some document to prove that I, also, have a\r\nright to extend the lines of my frontier?\"\r\n\r\nWhile Frederick spoke, he kept his eyes fixed upon the face of Prince\r\nKaunitz, as though he would have read to the very bottom of his soul.\r\nThe latter pretended not to be aware of it; he looked perfectly blank,\r\nwhile he affected to be still interested in examining the map.\r\n\r\n\"It would be fortunate if your majesty could discover such documents in\r\nYOUR archives,\" replied he, coolly. \"I have been told that you have,\r\nheretofore, sought for them in Warsaw; unhappily, without being able to\r\nfind any.\"\r\n\r\nThe king could not repress a slight start as he heard this revelation of\r\nhis own machinations. Kaunitz again affected to see nothing, although he\r\nwas looking directly in the king's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I say,\" continued Kaunitz, \"that it would be most fortunate if, JUST AT\r\nTHIS TIME, your majesty could recover your titles to that portion of\r\nPoland which lies contiguous to Russia. Austria, I assure you, will\r\nplace no difficulties in the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really,\" replied the king, \"I must say that these lines form a better\r\nnatural frontier than my present boundaries.\" Here he passed his hand\r\nsomewhere through the north-western provinces of Poland, while he\r\ncontinued: \"Would my word suffice if I were to say to Austria that the\r\ndocuments, proving my right to this territory, are to be found in the\r\narchives at Berlin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty's word, as regards this question, is worth more than the\r\ndocuments,\" said Kaunitz, deliberately.\r\n\r\n\"But what would Catharine say?--she who looks upon Poland as her own?\"\r\n\r\n\"If she says any thing, it is high time she were undeceived in that\r\nrespect,\" said Kaunitz, hastily. \"She must be satisfied to share equally\r\nwith others. Your majesty was pleased to relate to me a portion of the\r\nconversation between the empress and Prince Henry. The empress said, 'It\r\nseems as if one had nothing to do but stoop down to pick up something in\r\nPoland.' But you forgot the sequel. She added these words: 'If the court\r\nof Vienna begins the dismemberment of Poland I think that her neighbors\r\nhave a right to continue it.'\" [Footnote: La Roche Aymon \"Vie du Prince\r\nHenry\" p. 171.]\r\n\r\n\"Vraiment, your highness has trusty reporters, and your agents serve you\r\nadmirably!\" exclaimed the king.\r\n\r\nKaunitz bowed haughtily.\r\n\r\n\"We are your majesty's imitators,\" replied he. \"First during the\r\nSilesian war, then at the court of Dresden, we learned from you the\r\nvalue of secret information. [Footnote: Through his ambassador at\r\nDresden, Frederick had bribed the keeper of the Saxon archives to send\r\nhim copies of the secret treaties between Austria and Saxony. He did\r\neven worse, for the attache of the Austrian embassy at Berlin was in his\r\npay, and he sent the king copies of all the Austrian dispatches.--L.\r\nMuhlbach, \"Life of Frederick the Great.\"] Having been apprised of the\r\nremarkable words of the empress, I began to fear that she might encroach\r\nupon Poland without regard to the claims of Austria. Your majesty is\r\naware that the Russian army occupy Warsaw, and that a cordon of Russian\r\ntroops extend as far as the frontiers of Turkey.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if I draw my cordon beyond the district of Netz,\" cried the king,\r\ndrawing his finger across the map as if it had been a sword, \"and\r\nAustria extends her frontier beyond Galicia and the Zips, the republic\r\nof Poland will occupy but a small space on the map of Europe.\"\r\n\r\n\"The smaller the better; the fewer Poles there are in the world the less\r\nstrife there will be. The cradle of the Poles is that apple of discord\r\nwhich Eris once threw upon the table of the gods; they were born of its\r\nseeds, and dissension is their native element. As long as there lives a\r\nPole on the earth, that Pole will breed trouble among his neighbors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said the king, taking a pinch of snuff, \"and yet your highness was\r\nindignant at Catharine because she would force the Poles to keep the\r\npeace. She appears to ME to be entirely of one mind with yourself. She,\r\ntoo, looks upon Poland as the apple of Eris, and she has found it so\r\nover-ripe that it is in danger of falling from the tree. She has\r\nstationed her gardener, Stanislaus, to guard it. Let him watch over it.\r\nIt belongs to him, and if it come to the ground, he has nobody to blame\r\nbut himself. Meanwhile, should it burst, we will find means to prevent\r\nit from soiling US. Now let us speak of Turkey. That unlucky Porte must\r\nhave something done for him, and while we mediate in his behalf, I hope\r\nto bring about a good understanding between Austria and Russia. Let us\r\ndo our best to promote a general peace. Europe is bleeding at every\r\npore; let us bind up her wounds, and restore her to health.\"\r\n\r\n\"Austria is willing to promote the general welfare,\" replied Kaunitz,\r\nfollowing the king's example and rising from his chair, \"but first\r\nRussia must conclude an honorable peace with Turkey, and she must\r\nabandon her rapacious designs upon the rest of Europe. But should the\r\nEmpress of Russia compel us to war with her on this question we will not\r\nhave recourse to arms until we have found means to alienate from her the\r\nmost formidable of her allies.\"\r\n\r\nThe king laughed. \"I approve your policy,\" said he, \"but I am curious to\r\nknow how you would manage to prevent me from keeping my word. I am\r\ncertainly pledged to Russia, but I hope that the negotiations into which\r\nwe are about to enter will end in peace. I shall send a resume of our\r\nconference to the empress, and use every effort to establish friendly\r\nrelations between you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will your majesty communicate her reply to me?\" asked Kaunitz.\r\n\r\n\"I certainly will; for I am a soldier, not a diplomatist, and I am so\r\nmuch in love with truth that I shall be her devotee until the last\r\nmoment of my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, sire, a man must be a hero like yourself to have the courage to\r\nlove so dangerous a mistress. Truth is a rose with a thousand thorns. He\r\nwho plucks it will be wounded, and woe to the head of him who wears it\r\nin his crown!\"\r\n\r\n\"You and I have fought and bled too often on the field of diplomacy to\r\nbe tender about our heads. Let us, then, wear the crown of truth, and\r\nbear with its thorns.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the king reached out his hand, and Kaunitz took his leave.\r\n\r\nAfter the prince had left the room, Frederick remained for a few minutes\r\nlistening, until he heard the door of the farther anteroom closed.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Hertzberg,\" cried he, \"come out--the coast is clear.\"\r\n\r\nA gigantic screen, which divided the room in two, began to move, and\r\nforth came Count Herizberg, the king's prime minister.\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear it all?\" asked Frederick, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"I did, so please your majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you write it down, so that I can send its resume to the Empress\r\nCatharine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty, as far as it was possible to do so, I have written\r\ndown every word of your conference,\" said Hertzberg, with a dissatisfied\r\nexpression of countenance.\r\n\r\nThe king raised his large eyes with an inquiring look at the face of his\r\ntrusty minister. \"Are you not satisfied, Hertzberg? Why do you shake\r\nyour head? You have three wrinkles in your forehead, and the corners of\r\nyour mouth turn down as they always do when something has displeased\r\nyou. Speak out, man. Of what do you complain?\"\r\n\r\n\"First, I complain that your majesty has allowed the old fox to perceive\r\nthat you, as well as himself, entertain designs upon Poland, and that in\r\na manner you are willing to guarantee to Austria her theft of the Zips.\r\nI also complain that you have consented to induce Russia, through the\r\nintervention of Austria, to make peace with Turkey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\" asked the king.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty; that is all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, hear my defence. As regards your first complaint, I allowed\r\nthe old fox (as you call him) to scent my desire for Polish game,\r\nbecause I wished to find out exactly how far I could venture to go in\r\nthe matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire, and the consequences will be, that Austria, who has already\r\nappropriated the Zips, will stoop down to pick up something else. She\r\nhas already had her share of the booty, why should she divide with your\r\nmajesty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let Austria have her second share,\" cried the king, laughing. \"It will\r\nearn for her a double amount of the world's censure. [Footnote: The\r\nking's own words. Coxe, \"History of Austria,\" vol. v., p. 20.] As regards\r\nyour second complaint, let me tell you, that at this moment peace is\r\nindispensable to us all, and for this reason I desire to bring Russia\r\nand Austria into friendly relations with one another. I think it not\r\nonly wiser but more honorable to pacify Europe than to light the torch\r\nof war a second time. It is not an easy matter to secure a general\r\npeace, and we must all make some concessions to achieve a result so\r\ndesirable. Do you suppose that it is as easy to conciliate unfriendly\r\npowers as it is to write bad verses? I assure you, Hertzberg, that I\r\nwould rather sit down to render the whole Jewish history into madrigals,\r\nthan undertake to fuse into unanimity the conflicting interests of three\r\nsovereigns, when two out of the three are women! But I will do my best.\r\nWhen your neighbor's house is on fire, help to put it out, or it may\r\ncommunicate and burn down your own.\" [Footnote: The king's own\r\nwords. \"Ceuvres Posthumes,\" vol. ii., p. 187]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV.\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTESS WIELOPOLSKA.\r\n\r\n\"You really think that he will come, Matuschka?\" asked the Countess\r\nWielopolska of her waiting-woman, who, standing behind the chair, was\r\nfastening a string of pearls in her lady's dusky hair.\r\n\r\n\"I know he will come, your ladyship,\" replied Matuschka.\r\n\r\n\"And you have seen the emperor and spoken to him!\" exclaimed the\r\ncountess, pressing her delicate white hands upon her heart, as though\r\nshe strove to imprison its wild emotions.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I have, my lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, tell me of it again, Matuschka; tell me, that I may not fancy it a\r\ndream!\" cried the countess, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, my lady, I took your note to the palace, where the emperor\r\nhas given positive orders that every one who wishes it shall be admitted\r\nto his presence. The guard before the door let me pass into the\r\nantechamber. One of the lords in waiting told me that the emperor would\r\nbe there before a quarter of an hour. I had not waited so long when the\r\ndoor opened and a handsome young man in a plain white uniform walked in.\r\nI should never have taken him for the emperor, except that the lord\r\nstood up so straight when he saw him. Then I knelt down and gave the\r\nletter. The emperor took it and said: 'Tell your lady that I am not\r\nprepared to receive ladies in my palace; but since she wishes to see me,\r\nI will go to her. If she will be at home this evening, I will find time\r\nto call upon her myself.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" cried the countess, \"he will soon be here. I shall see him--speak\r\nto him--pour out the longings of my bursting heart! Oh, Matuschka, as\r\nthe moment approaches, I feel as if I could fly away and plunge into the\r\nwild waters of the Vistula that bear my husband's corpse, or sink\r\nlifeless upon the battle-field that is reddened with the blood of my\r\nbrothers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not think of these dreadful things, dear lady,\" said Matuschka,\r\ntrying to keep back her tears; \"it is twilight, and the emperor will\r\nsoon be here. Look cheerful--for you are as beautiful as an angel when\r\nyou smile, and the emperor will be much more apt to be moved by your\r\nsmiles than by your tears.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Matuschka,\" cried the countess, rising hastily from her\r\nseat. \"I will not weep, for I must try to find favor in the emperor's\r\neyes.\"\r\n\r\nShe crossed the room and stood before a Psyche, where for some time she\r\nscrutinized her own features; not with the self-complacency of a vain\r\nwoman, but with the critical acuteness of an artist who contemplates a\r\nfine picture. Gradually her eyes grew soft and her mouth rippled with a\r\nsmile. Like a mourning Juno she stood in the long black velvet dress\r\nthat sharply defined the outlines of her faultless bust and fell in\r\ngraceful folds around her stately figure. Her bodice was clasped by an\r\nagrafe of richest pearls; and the white throat and the jewel lay\r\ntogether, pearl beside pearl, each rivalling the snowy lustre of the\r\nother. Had it not been for those starry eyes that looked out so full of\r\nmournful splendor, her face might have seemed too statuesque in its\r\nbeauty; but from their dark depths all the enthusiasm of a nature that\r\nhad concentrated its every emotion into one master-passion, lit up her\r\nface with flashes that came and went like summer lightning.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am beautiful,\" whispered she, while a sad smile played around\r\nher exquisite month. \"My beauty is the last weapon left me wherewith to\r\nbattle for Poland. I must take advantage of it. Life and honor, wealth\r\nand blood, every thing for my country!\"\r\n\r\nShe turned to her waiting-woman as a queen would have done who was\r\ndismissing her subjects.\r\n\r\n\"Go, Matuschka,\" said she, \"and take some rest. You have been laboring\r\nfor me all day, and I cannot bear to think that the only friend left me\r\nin this world should be overtasked for me. Sometimes you look at me as\r\nmy mother once did; and then I dream that I feel her hand laid lovingly\r\nupon my head, and hear her dear voice exhorting me to pray that God\r\nwould bless me with strength to do my duty to my bleeding country.\"\r\nMatuschka fell upon her knees and kissed the hem of her mistress's robe.\r\n\r\n\"Do not give way,\" sobbed she, \"do not grieve now.\"\r\n\r\nThe countess did not hear. She had thrown back her head and was gazing\r\nabsently above. \"Oh, yes, I am mindful of my duty,\" murmured she. \"I\r\nhave not forgotten the vow I made to my mother and sealed upon her dying\r\nlips with my last kiss! I have been a faithful daughter of my\r\nfatherland. I have given every thing--there remains nothing but myself,\r\nand oh, how gladly would I give my life for Poland! But God has forsaken\r\nus; His eyes are turned away!\"\r\n\r\n\"Accuse not the Lord, dear lady,\" prayed Matuschka. \"Put your trust in\r\nHim, and take courage.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true. I have no right to accuse my Maker,\" sighed the\r\ncountess. \"When the last drop of Polish blood is spent and the last\r\nPolish heart is crushed beneath the tramp of the enemy's hosts, then it\r\nwill be time to cry to Heaven! Rise, Matuschka, and weep no more. All is\r\nnot yet lost. Let us hope, and labor that hope may become reality, and\r\nPoland may be free!\"\r\n\r\nShe reached her hand to Matuschka and passed into an adjoining room. It\r\nwas the state apartment of the inn, and was always reserved for\r\ndistinguished guests. It had been richly furnished, but the teeth of\r\ntime had nibbled many a rent in the old-fashioned furniture, the faded\r\ncurtains, and the well-worn carpet. Matuschka, however, had given an air\r\nof some elegance to the place. On the carved oak table in the centre\r\nstood a vase of flowers; and, that her dear mistress might have\r\nsomething to remind her of home, Matuschka had procured a piano, to\r\nwhich the countess, when weary of her thoughts, might confide the hopes\r\nand fears that were surging in her storm-tossed heart.\r\n\r\nThe piano was open, and a sheet of music lay on the desk. As the\r\ncountess perceived it, she walked rapidly toward the instrument and sat\r\ndown before it.\r\n\r\n\"I will sing,\" said she. \"The emperor loves music, above all things the\r\nmusic of Gluck.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned over the leaves, and then said, softly:\r\n\r\n\"`Orpheus and Eurydice!' La, Bernasconi told me that this was his\r\nfavorite opera. Oh, that I knew which aria he loved the best?\"\r\n\r\nShe struck a few chords, and in a low voice began to sing. Gradually her\r\nbeautiful features lost their sadness, she seemed to forget herself and\r\nher sorrows, and to yield up her soul to the influence of Gluck's\r\nheavenly music. And now, with all the power, the melody, the pathos of\r\nher matchless voice, she sang, \"Che faro senza Eurydice!\"\r\n\r\nThe more she sang, the brighter grew her lovely face. Forgetful of all\r\nthings around, she gave herself wholly up to the inspiration of the\r\nhour, and from its fountains of harmony she drew sweetest draughts of\r\nconsolation and of hope.\r\n\r\nThe door had opened, and she had not beard it. On the threshold stood\r\nthe emperor, followed by Matuschka, while the countess, all unmindful,\r\nfilled the air with strains so divine, that they might have been the\r\nmarriage-hymns of Love wedded to Song.\r\n\r\nThe emperor had stopped for a moment to listen. His face, which at first\r\nhad worn an expression of smiling flippancy, now changed its aspect. He\r\nrecognized the music, and felt his heart heat wildly. With a commanding\r\ngesture, he motioned Matuschka to withdraw, and noiselessly closed the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXYI.\r\n\r\nTHE EMPEROR AND THE COUNTESS.\r\n\r\nThe countess continued to sing, although Joseph had advanced as far as\r\nthe centre of the room. The thickness of the carpet made his footfall\r\ninaudible. He stood with his right hand resting upon the oak table,\r\nwhile he leaned forward to listen, and one by one the dead memories of\r\nhis youthful love came thronging around his heart, and filling it with\r\nan ecstasy that was half joy and half sorrow.\r\n\r\nMore and more impassioned grew the music, while the air was tremulous\r\nwith melody. It softened and softened, until it melted away in sobs. The\r\nhands of the enchantress fell from the keys; she bowed her head, and\r\nleaning against the music, burst into tears. The emperor, too, felt the\r\ntear-drops gather in his eyes; he dashed them away, and went rapidly up\r\nto the piano.\r\n\r\n\"Countess,\" said he, in his soft, mellow tones, \"I felt it no\r\nindiscretion to listen unseen to your heavenly music, but no one save\r\nGod has a right to witness your grief.\"\r\n\r\nShe started, and rising quickly, the emperor saw the face of the lady\r\nwho had thrown him the wreath.\r\n\r\n\"It is she!\" cried he, \"the beautiful Confederate! I thank you from my\r\nheart for the favor you have done me, for I have sought you for some\r\ndays in vain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty sought me?\" said she, smiling. \"Then I am sure that you\r\nare ready to sympathize with misfortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you need sympathy?\" asked he, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Sire, I am a daughter of Poland,\" replied she.\r\n\r\n\"And the Wielopolskas are among the noblest and richest of Poland's\r\nnoble families.\"\r\n\r\n\"Noble! Rich! Our castles have been burned by the Russians, our fields\r\nhave been laid waste, our vassals have been massacred, and of our\r\nkinsmen, some have died under the knout, while others drag out a life of\r\nmartyrdom in Siberia.\"\r\n\r\n\"One of the Counts Wielopolska was a favorite of the king, was he not?\"\r\nasked Joseph, much moved.\r\n\r\n\"He was my husband,\" replied she, bitterly. \"Heedless of his\r\ncountrymen's warnings, he believed in the patriotism of Stanislaus. When\r\nhe saw his error, he felt that he merited death, and expiated his fault\r\nby self-destruction. His grave is in the Vistula.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unhappy wife!\" exclaimed the emperor. \"And had you no other kinsman?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had a father and three brothers.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire, but I have them no longer. My brothers died on the field of\r\nbattle; my father, oh, my father!--God grant that he be no more among\r\nthe living, FOR HE IS IN SIBERIA!\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor raised his hands in horror; then extending them to the\r\ncountess, he took hers, and said in a voice of deepest sympathy \"I thank\r\nyou for coming to me. Tell me your plans for the future, that I may\r\nlearn how best I may serve you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, I have none,\" sighed she. \"Life is so mournful, that I long to\r\nclose my eyes forever upon its tragedies, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"But what?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should then be robbed of the sight of him who has promised succor to\r\nmy fatherland,\" cried she, passionately, while she sank upon her knees\r\nand clasped her hands convulsively together.\r\n\r\nJoseph bent over, and would have raised her from the floor. \"It ill\r\nbecomes such beauty to kneel before me,\" said he, softly.\r\n\r\n\"Let me kneel, let me kneel!\" exclaimed she, while her beautiful eyes\r\nsuffused with tears. \"Here, at your feet, let me implore your protection\r\nfor Poland! Have mercy, sire, upon the Confederates, whose only crime is\r\ntheir resistance to foreign oppression. Reach out your imperial band to\r\nTHEM, and bid them be free, for they must either be slaves, or die by\r\ntheir own hands. Emperor of Austria, save the children of Sobieski from\r\nbarbarous Russia!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not fear,\" replied Joseph, kindly. \"I promised the Confederates that\r\nAustria would recognize their envoy, and I will redeem my word. Rise,\r\ncountess, I implore you, rise, and may the day not be distant when I\r\nshall extend my hand to Poland as I now do to you. You have a pledge of\r\nmy sincerity, in the fact that we have both a common enemy, and it will\r\nnot be my fault if I do not oppose her, sword in hand. Still, although\r\nmen call me emperor, I am the puppet of another will. The crown of\r\nAustria is on my mother's head; its shadow, alone, is upon mine. I speak\r\nfrankly to you; but our acquaintance is peculiar, and, by its nature,\r\nhas broken down the ordinary barriers of conventional life. Your songs\r\nand your tears have spoken directly to my heart recalling the oniy happy\r\ndays that I have ever known on earth. But I am growing sentimental. You\r\nwill pardon me, I know, for you are a woman, and have known what it is\r\nto love.\"\r\n\r\nShe slowly shook her head. \"No, sire,\" replied she, \"I have never known\r\nwhat it was to love.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor looked directly in her eyes. SHE! Beautiful and majestic as\r\nHera,--SHE, not know what it was to love! \"And your husband--\" asked he.\r\n\r\n\"I was married to him as Poland was given to Stanislaus. I never saw him\r\nuntil he became my husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your heart refused allegiance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, I have never yet seen the man who was destined to reign over my\r\nheart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you are proud! I envy him who is destined to conquer that\r\nenchanting domain.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked for one moment at the emperor, and then said, blushing:\r\n\"Sire, my heart will succumb to him who rescues Poland. With rapture it\r\nwill acknowledge him as lord and sovereign of my being.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor made no reply. He gazed with a significant smile at the\r\nlovely enthusiast, until she blushed again, and her eyes sought the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, countess,\" said Joseph, after a pause, \"if all the women of Poland\r\nwere of your mind, a multitudinous army would soon flock to her\r\nstandard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every Polish woman is of one mind with me. We are all the daughters of\r\none mother, and our love for her is stronger than death.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor shook his lead. \"Were this true,\" replied he, \"Poland would\r\nnever have fallen as she has done. But far be it from me to heap\r\nreproaches upon the unfortunate. I will do what it lies in my power to\r\ndo for the Poles, provided they are willing to second my efforts for\r\nthemselves. If they would have peace, however, with other nations, they\r\nmust show strength and unity of purpose among themselves. Until they can\r\nstand before the world in the serried ranks of a national unanimity,\r\nthey must expect to be assailed by their rapacious neighbors. But let us\r\nforget politics for a moment. I long to speak to you of yourself. What\r\nare your plans? How can I serve you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, I have no plans. I ask nothing of the world but a place of\r\nrefuge, where I can sorrow unseen.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are too young, and, pardon me, if I add, too beautiful, to fly from\r\nthe world. Come to Vienna, and learn from me how easy it is to live\r\nwithout happiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty will allow me to go to Vienna?\" cried the countess,\r\njoyfully. \"Ever since I have felt that I could do nothing for Poland, I\r\nhave longed to live in Vienna, that I might breathe the same atmosphere\r\nwith your majesty and the Empress Maria Theresa. You are the only\r\nsovereigns in Europe who have shown any compassion for the misfortunes\r\nof my country, and before your generous sympathy my heart bows down in\r\ngratitude and admiration.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say you so, proud heart, that has never bowed before?\" exclaimed the\r\nemperor, smiling, and taking the countess's white hand in his. \"Come,\r\nthen, to Vienna, not to do homage, but to receive it, for nothing\r\nbecomes your beauty more than pride. Come to Vienna., and I will see\r\nthat new friends and new ties awaken your heart to love and happiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have one relative in Vienna, sire, the Countess von Salmour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! one of the empress's ladies of honor. Then you will not need my\r\nprotection there, for the countess is in high favor with the empress;\r\nand I may say, that she has more influence at court than I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" said the countess, raising her large eyes with an appealing\r\nlook, \"I shall go to Vienna, if I go under your majesty's protection and\r\nwith your sanction.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall have both,\" replied Joseph, warmly. \"I will write to my\r\nmother to-day, and you shall present my letter. When will you leave? I\r\ndare not ask you to tarry here, for this is no place for lovely and\r\nunprotected women. Moreover, the King of Prussia has no sympathy with\r\nPoland, and he will like you the less for the touching appeal you made\r\nin her behalf when you sang at the concert. Greet the empress for me,\r\nand let me hope that you will stir her heart as you have stirred mine.\r\nAnd now farewell. My time has expired: the King of Prussia expects me to\r\nsupper. I must part from you, but I leave comforted, since I am enabled\r\nto say in parting, 'Au revoir.'\"\r\n\r\nHe bowed, and turned to quit the room. But at the door he spoke again.\r\n\r\n\"If I ever win the right to claim any thing of you, will you sing for me\r\nthe aria that I found you singing to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! your majesty,\" said the countess, coming eagerly forward. \"you have\r\nalready earned the right to claim whatsoever you desire of me. I can\r\nnever speak my gratitude for your condescension; perhaps music will\r\nspeak for me. How gladly, then, will I sing when you command me!\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall claim the promise in Vienna,\" said he, as he left the room.\r\n\r\nThe countess remained standing just where he had met her, breathlessly\r\nlistening to his voice, which for a while she heard in the anteroom, and\r\nthen to the last echoes of his retreating steps.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the door was opened, and Matuschka, with joyful mien, came\r\nforward with a purse in her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my lady,\" exclaimed she, \"the emperor has given me this purse to\r\ndefray our expenses to Vienna!\"\r\n\r\nThe countess started, and her pale face suffused with crimson shame.\r\n\r\n\"Alms!\" said she, bitterly. \"He treats me like a beggar!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, lady,\" said Matuschka abashed; \"the emperor told me that he had\r\nbegged you to go to Vienna for business of state, and that he had a\r\nright to provide the expenses of our journey there. He said--\"\r\n\r\nThe countess waved her hand impatiently. \"Go back to the emperor,\" said\r\nshe haughtily. \"Tell him that you dare not offer this purse to your\r\nlady, for you know that she would rather die than receive alms, even\r\nfrom an emperor.\"\r\n\r\nMatuschka cast down her eyes, and turned away. But she hesitated, and\r\nlooked timidly at her mistress, whose great, glowing eyes were fixed\r\nupon her in unmistakable displeasure.\r\n\r\n\"My lady,\" said she, with embarrassment, \"I will do your bidding, but\r\nyou who have been so rich and great, know nothing of the troubles of\r\npoverty. Your money is exhausted. I would rather melt my own heart's\r\nblood into gold than tell you so; but indeed, dear lady, if you refuse\r\nthe emperor's gift you wilt be without a kreutzer in your purse.\"\r\n\r\nThe countess raised her hands to her hair and unfastened the pearl\r\nwreath with which Matuschka had decorated it in anticipation of the\r\nemperor's visit.\r\n\r\n\"There--take this and sell it. You will readily find a jeweller who\r\nunderstands its value, and if he pays us but the half, it will be twice\r\nthe sum which you hold in the emperor's purse.\"\r\n\r\n\"My lady, would you sell your family jewels? Have you forgotten that\r\nyour family are pledged not to sell their heirlooms?\"\r\n\r\n\"God will forgive me if I break my vow. It is more honorable to part\r\nwith my ancestral jewels than to receive alms. I have no heirs, and no\r\none will be wronged by the act. I have but my mother--Poland. For her I\r\nam ready to sacrifice the little I possess, and when nothing else\r\nremains, I shall yield my life. Go, Matuschka, go!\"\r\n\r\nMatuschka took the wreath and wept. \"I go, lady,\" sobbed she. \"This will\r\nlast you for half a year, and then the armlets, then the diadem of\r\nbrilliants, the bracelets, and the necklace, must all go. God grant you\r\nmay live so long on these family treasures, that old Matuschka may be\r\nspared the humiliation of selling the rest! I have lived too long, since\r\nI must chaffer with a base-born tradesman for the jewels that were the\r\nroyal gift of John Sobieski to my lady's noble ancestors.\"\r\n\r\nShe raised the countess's robe to her lips, and left the room. Her\r\nmistress looked after her, but her thoughts were wandering elsewhere.\r\nSlowly sinking on her knees, she began to pray, and the burden of her\r\nprayer was this:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my God, grant that I may win his love!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII.\r\n\r\nMARIA THERESA.\r\n\r\nThe pearls were sold, the countess had arrived in Vienna; and she was in\r\nthe presence of the empress, whom, although they had never met before,\r\nshe had so long regarded with affectionate admiration.\r\n\r\n\"I rejoice to see you,\" said Maria Theresa, graciously extending her\r\nhand. \"It gives me pleasure to receive a relative of the Countess von\r\nSalmour. But you have another claim upon my sympathy, for you are a\r\nPolish woman, and I can never forget that, but for John Sobieski, Vienna\r\nwould have been a prey to the infidel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon your majesty's generous remembrance of Sobieski's alliance rests\r\nthe last hope of Poland!\" exclaimed the countess, kneeling and kissing\r\nthe hand of the empress. \"God has inclined to her redemption the heart\r\nof the noblest woman in Europe, and through her magnanimity will the\r\nwicked Empress of Russia receive her check. Oh, your majesty, that\r\nwoman, in the height of her arrogance, believes to-day that you are only\r\ntoo willing to further her rapacity and participate in her crimes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Never shall it be said that she and I have one thought or one object in\r\ncommon!\" cried Maria Theresa, her face glowing with indignation. \"Let\r\nher cease her oppression of Poland, or the Austrian eagle will seize the\r\nRussian vulture!\"\r\n\r\nThe face of the countess grew radiant with joy. Raising her beautiful\r\narms to heaven, she cried out exultingly: \"King of kings, Thou hast\r\nheard! Maria Theresa comes to our help! Oh, your majesty, how many\r\nthousand hearts, from this day, will bow down in homage before your\r\nthrone! Hereafter, not God, but Maria Theresa, will be our refuge!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not blaspheme,\" cried the empress, crossing herself. \"I am but the\r\nservant of the Lord, and I do His divine will on earth. God is our\r\nrefuge and our strength, and He will nerve my arm to overcome evil and\r\nwork out good. I will countenance and uphold the Confederates, because\r\nit is my honest conviction that their cause is just, and that they are\r\nthe only party in Poland who act in honor and good faith.\" [Foonote: The\r\nempress's own words. See Ferrand, i., p. 72.]\r\n\r\n\"Hitherto, they would have died to vindicate that honor and that faith;\r\nnow they will live to defend it from their oppressors. Oh, your majesty,\r\npardon me, if, in my rapture at your goodness, I forget what is due to\r\nyour exalted station. My heart will burst if I may not give utterance to\r\nmy joy. I am a lonely creature, with no tie but that which binds me to\r\nmy unhappy mother, Polonia!\"\r\n\r\n\"So young, and without home or kindred!\" said the empress, kindly. \"I\r\nhave already heard of your misfortunes, poor child, from my son the\r\nemperor.\"\r\n\r\nAt the name of the emperor, the countess's pale face was tinged with a\r\nfaint rosy color. The empress did not remark it, for she was already\r\nthinking what a pity it was that such a surpassingly beautiful woman\r\nshould be a widow; that such an enchanting creature should be unloved\r\nand unwedded.\r\n\r\n\"You are too handsome,\" said she, \"to remain single. Woman was made for\r\nlove and marriage. Happy is she who can devote her whole heart to the\r\nsweet responsibilities of domestic life, and who is not called upon to\r\nassume the duties that weigh down the head of royalty.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the empress spoke, her eyes were fixed upon the portrait of the\r\nEmperor Francis, which still hung between the windows in the place of\r\nthe mirror, which had been removed from its frame. The Countess\r\nWielopolska had been admitted to the gay sitting-room.\r\n\r\n\"Earthly grandeur,\" continued she, \"is beset with pains and cares; but\r\nthe happy wife, whose subjects are her own dear children, is one degree\r\nremoved from the bliss of angels. You must marry, my dear, and I will\r\nfind for you a brilliant parti.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am poor, your majesty, and am too proud to enter a rich man's palace\r\nwithout a dowry. \"\r\n\r\n\"You shall have your dowry. I shall instruct my ambassador at St.\r\nPetersburg to demand the return of your estates. It will be one good\r\ndeed by which that woman [Footnote: The words by which Maria Theresa\r\nalways designated Catharine.] may expiate some of her many crimes. Your\r\nestates once restored, you will be an equal match for any nobleman in\r\nEurope. \"\r\n\r\n\"If I should receive my estates through your majesty's intercession,\"\r\nreplied the countess, \"my home would be an asylum for all the\r\nunfortunate Poles. I should think it treason to dream of personal\r\nhappiness, while Poland lies shackled and bleeding.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Poland shall be free!\" cried the empress, with enthusiasm. \"With\r\nthe cooperation of France, the voice of Austria will be so loud that\r\nRussia will hear, and withdraw her unjust claims. We will strike off the\r\nfetters of Poland, while we forge a gentle chain for the Countess\r\nWielopolska: a chain that falls so lightly upon woman, that its burden\r\nis sweeter than freedom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty must forgive me,\" reiterated the countess; \"I have sworn\r\non my mother's grave, that as long as I can be useful, I will live for\r\nPoland. Should she regain her freedom, I will retire to a convent, where\r\nevery breath I draw shall be a thanksgiving to God. Should she be doomed\r\nto slavery, she will need her sons and daughters no more, and then I\r\nwill die. Your majesty sees that I am already betrothed. I shall soon be\r\nthe bride of Heaven, or the bride of Death.\"\r\n\r\n\"The bride of Heaven!\" repeated the empress, her eyes swimming with\r\ntears. \"Then be it so; it is not I who would entice Mary from her\r\nMaster's feet. The world is full of Marthas, troubled about many things.\r\nGo, choose the better part, sweet enthusiast, and I will see that you\r\nhave cause for thanksgiving. \"\r\n\r\nShe reached her hand to the countess, who kissed it and withdrew. As she\r\nopened the door, she felt the bolt turn from the outside.\r\n\r\n\"His highness Prince Kaunitz,\" cried a page; and as the countess was\r\nmaking one last inclination of the head, the tall, slender form of\r\nKaunitz filled the space behind her.\r\n\r\n\"Have I permission to enter, your majesty?\" said the minister.\r\n\r\n\"You are always welcome, prince,\" replied the empress.\r\n\r\nKaunitz bowed slightly, and as he raised his cold eye to the face of the\r\ncountess, a faint smile flitted over his features, but it was followed\r\nby a sneer. Without acknowledging her presence by the smallest courtesy,\r\nhe advanced to the empress, and the door closed upon Poland forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\r\n\r\nMARIE ANTOINETTE AND COURT ETIQUETTE.\r\n\r\n\"Letters from France, your majesty,\" said Kaunitz, and the face of the\r\nempress grew bright as she recognized the handwriting of her daughter.\r\n\r\n\"The dauphiness is well?\" said she. \"Next to her dear self, I love to\r\nsee her writing. Ah, I have grown very lonely since my little Antoinette\r\nhas left me! One by one my children go; one dear face alone remains,\"\r\ncontinued she, pointing to the portrait of the emperor. Then looking at\r\nthe letters in the hands of the prince, she said:\r\n\r\n\"Have you good news?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty. The dauphiness is adored by the French people. They\r\nrepeat her bon mots, write odes and madrigals to her beauty, and hang up\r\nher portrait in their houses. When she drives out in her caleche they\r\nimpede its progress with their welcomes; and when she appears at the\r\ntheatre, the prima donnas are forgotten. Half a year ago, when she made\r\nher entry into Paris and more than a hundred thousand people went out to\r\nmeet her, the Duke de Brissac said, 'Madame, you have one hundred\r\nthousand lovers, and yet the dauphin will never be jealous of them.'\r\n[Footnote: \"Memoirs of Madame de Campan,\" vol. i., p. 60.] The dear old\r\nDuke! He little knew what literal truth he spoke of the dauphin on that\r\noccasion.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked the empress, hastily. \"I know by the\r\nexpression of your face that you have something unpleasant to tell.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean to say the dauphin is not jealous, because he is the only man in\r\nFrance who is not in love with the dauphiness.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress turned scarlet. \"This is a serious charge which you presume\r\nto make against the dauphin,\" said she, frowning.\r\n\r\n\"It is unhappily true,\" replied Kaunitz, coolly,\r\n\r\n\"The dauphiness makes no mention of such a state of things in her letter.\r\nIt does not breathe a word of complaint.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the dauphiness, in the innocence of her heart, has no idea of\r\nthe grounds which she has for complaint.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress looked displeased. \"Do you know that your language is\r\noffensive?\" said she. \"You assert that the dauphin is insensible to the\r\ncharms of his beautiful young wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty well knows that I never assert a falsehood. The dauphin is\r\nnot in love with his wife, and I do not believe that she has an advocate\r\nat the court of Louis XV. Since the shameless partisans of Du Barry have\r\ntriumphed over the noble Duke of Choiseul, the dauphiness is without a\r\nfriend. The Duke d'Arguillon is anti-Austrian, and your majesty knows\r\nwhat an enemy to Austria was the father of the dauphin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you seek to torture me, Kaunitz?\" said the empress, impatiently.\r\n\"You are not telling me all this for nothing. Say at once what you have\r\nto say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty has not yet read the letter which I had the honor of\r\nhanding to you just now, I believe,\" said Kaunitz.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa took up the letter from the gueridon on which she had\r\nlaid it, and began to look it over.\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" sighed she. \"The dauphiness complains of solitude. 'Since\r\nthe Duke de Choiseul has left,' writes she, 'I am alone, and without a\r\nfriend.' You are right. The dauphiness is in danger. She writes that her\r\nenemies are intriguing to part her from the dauphin. They attempted in\r\nFontainebleau to assign her a suite of apartments remote from those of\r\nher husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the anti-Austrian party, seeing that he is indifferent to her, are\r\ndoing their best to convert this indifference into dislike. But the\r\ndauphiness saw through the affair, and complained to the king.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was right and bold!\" cried the empress, joyfully.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it was bold, for it gained another enemy for the dauphiness. She\r\nshould have spoken to the king through the Duke d'Arguillon, instead of\r\nwhich she applied to his majesty herself. The duke will never forgive\r\nher; and when the Duchess de Noailles reproved the dauphiness, she\r\nreplied that she would never take counsel of etiquette where her family\r\naffairs were concerned. The consequence is that the duchess also has\r\ngone over to the enemy.\"\r\n\r\n\"To the enemy?\" exclaimed the empress, anxiously. \"Has she, then, other\r\nenemies?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame de Marsan, the governess of the sisters of the dauphin, will\r\nnever forgive her for having interfered in the education of the young\r\nprincesses.\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely the daughters of the king will be kind to my poor Marie\r\nAntoinette!\" exclaimed the empress, ready to burst into tears. \"They\r\npromised to love her; and it is but natural and womanly that they should\r\nshun the party which upholds the profligate woman who rules the King of\r\nFrance!\"\r\n\r\nPrince Kaunitz slightly elevated his shoulders. \"Madame Adelaide, the\r\neldest, until the marriage of the dauphin, held the first place at\r\ncourt. Now, the daupbiness has precedence of her, and the court\r\ncard-parties are held in her apartments. Madaine Adelaide, therefore,\r\nhas refused to be present, and retires to her own rooms, where she holds\r\nrival card-parties which are attended by the anti-Austrians, who are\r\nopposed to Du Barry. This is the second party who intrigue against the\r\ndauphiness.--Madame Sophie perchance remembers her in her prayers; but\r\nshe is too pious to be of use to anybody. Madame Victoire, who really\r\nloves the dauphiness, is so sickly, that she scarcely ever leaves her\r\nroom. For a while she held little reunions there, which, being very\r\npleasant, were for a while attended by the dauphiness; but Madame de\r\nNoailles objected, and court etiquette required that they should be\r\ndiscontinued.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress had risen and was acing the floor in great agitation. \"So\r\nyoung, so lovely, and slighted by her husband!\" murmured she, bitterly,\r\nwhile large tear-drops stood in her eyes. \"The daughter of the Caesars\r\nin strife with a king's base-born mistress and a vile faction who hate\r\nher without cause! And I--her mother --an empress, am powerless to help\r\nher!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty,\" said Kaunitz, \"not altogether powerless. You cannot\r\nhelp her with armies, but you can do so with good advice, and no one can\r\nadvise her as effectually as her mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Advise her? What advice can I give?\" cried the empress, angrily. \"Shall\r\nI counsel her to attend the petits soupers of the king, and truckle to\r\nhis mistress? Never! never! My daughter may be unhappy, but she shall\r\nnot be dishonored!\"\r\n\r\n\"I should not presume to make any such proposition to the dauphiness,\"\r\nsaid Kaunitz, quietly. \"One cannot condescend to Du Barry as we did to La\r\nPompadour. The latter was at least a woman of mind, the former is\r\nnothing more than a vulgar beauty. But there is another lady whose\r\ninfluence at court is without limit--one whom Du Barry contemns, but\r\nwhom the dauphiness would do well to conciliate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of what lady do you speak, Kaunitz?\"\r\n\r\n\"I speak of Madame Etiquette, your majesty. She is a stiff and tiresome\r\nold dame, I grant you, but in France she presides over every thing.\r\nWithout her the royal family can neither sleep nor wake; they can\r\nneither take a meal if they be in health, nor a purge if they be\r\nindisposed, without her everlasting surveillance. She directs their\r\ndress, amusements, associates, and behavior; she presides over their\r\npleasures, their weariness, their social hours, and their hours of\r\nsolitude. This may be uncomfortable, but royalty cannot escape it, and\r\nit must he endured.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the business of Madame de Noailles to attend to the requisitions\r\nof court etiquette,\" said the empress, impatiently. \"And of the\r\ndauphiness to attend to her representations,\" added Kaunitz.\r\n\r\n\"She will certainly have enough discretion to conform herself to such\r\nobligations!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty, a girl of fifteen who has a hundred thousand lovers is\r\nnot apt to be troubled with discretion. The dauphiness is bored to death\r\nby Madame de Noailles's eternal sermons, and therein she may be right.\r\nBut she turns the mistress of ceremonies into ridicule, and therein she\r\nis wrong. In an outburst of her vexation the dauphiness one day called\r\nher 'old Madame Etiquette,' and, as the bon mots of a future queen are\r\napt to be repeated, Madame de Noailles goes by no other name at court.\r\nAgain--not long ago the dauphiness gave a party of pleasure at\r\nVersailles. The company were mounted on donkeys.\"\r\n\r\n\"On donkeys!\" cried the empress with horror.\r\n\r\n\"On donkeys,\" repeated Kaunitz, with composure. \"The donkey on which the\r\ndauphiness rode was unworthy of the honor conferred upon it. It threw\r\nits royal rider.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Antoinette fell off?\"\r\n\r\n\"She fell, your majesty--and fell without exercising any particular\r\ndiscretion in the matter. The Count d'Artois came forward to her\r\nassistance, but she waved him off, saying with comic earnestness, 'Do\r\nnot touch me for your life! Send a courier for Madame Etiquette and wait\r\nuntil she has prescribed the important ceremonies with which a\r\ndauphiness is to be remounted upon the back of her donkey.' Every one\r\nlaughed of course, and the next day when the thing was repeated,\r\neverybody in Paris was heartily amused--except Madame de Noailles. She\r\ndid not laugh.\"\r\n\r\nNeither could the empress vouchsafe a smile, although the affair was\r\nludicrous enough. She was still walking to and fro, her face scarlet\r\nwith mortification. She stopped directly in front of her unsympathizing\r\nminister, and said: \"You are right. I must warn Antoinette that she is\r\ngoing too far. Oh, my heart bleeds when I think of my dear,\r\ninexperienced child cast friendless upon the reef, of that dangerous and\r\ncorrupt court of France! My God! my God! why did I not heed the warning\r\nI received? Why did I consent to let her go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because your majesty was too wise to be guided by lunatics and\r\nimpostors, and because you recognized, not only the imperative necessity\r\nwhich placed Marie Antoinette upon the throne of France, but also the\r\nvalue and the blessing of a close alliance with the French.\"\r\n\r\n\"God grant it may prove a blessing!\" sighed the empress. \"I will write\r\nto-day, and implore her to call to aid all her discretion--for Heaven\r\nknows it is needed at the court of France!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not an easy thing to call up discretion whenever discretion is\r\nneeded,\" said Kaunitz, thoughtfully. \"Has not your majesty, with that\r\ngoodness which does so much honor to your heart, gone so far as to\r\npromise help to the quarrelsome Poles?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the empress, warmly, \"and I intend to keep my promise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Promises, your majesty, are sometimes made which it is impossible to\r\nkeep.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I make no such promises, and therefore honor requires that I fulfil\r\nmy imperial pledge. Yes, we have promised help and comfort to the\r\npatriotic Confederates, the defenders of liberty and of the true faith,\r\nand God forbid that we should ever deceive those who trust to us for\r\nprotection!\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz bowed. \"Then your majesty will have the goodness to apprise the\r\nemperor that the army must be put upon a war footing; our magazines must\r\nbe replenished, and Austria must prepare herself to suffer all the\r\nhorrors of a long war.\"\r\n\r\n\"A war? With whom?\" exclaimed the astounded empress.\r\n\r\n\"With Russia, Prussia, Sweden, perchance with all Europe. Does your\r\nmajesty suppose that the great powers will suffer the establishment of a\r\nrepublic here, under the protection of Austria?--a republic upon the\r\nbody politic of a continent of monarchies, which, like a scirrhous sore,\r\nwill spread disease that must end in death to all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of what republic do you speak?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE TRIUMPH OF DIPLOMACY.\r\n\r\n\"I speak of Poland,\" said Kaunitz, with his accustomed indifference. \"I\r\nspeak of those insolent Confederates, who, emboldened by the\r\ncondescension of your majesty and the emperor, are ready to dare every\r\nthing for the propagation of their pernicious political doctrines. They\r\nhave been pleased to declare Stanislaus deposed, and the throne of\r\nPoland vacant. This declaration has been committed to writing, and with\r\nthe signatures of the leading Confederates attached to it, has been\r\nactually placed in the king's hands, in his own palace at Warsaw. Not\r\ncontent with this, they have distributed thousands of these documents\r\nthroughout Poland, so that the question to-day, in that miserable\r\nhornets' nest, is not whether the right of the Confederates are to be\r\nguaranteed to them, but whether the kingdom of Poland shall remain a\r\nmonarchy or be converted into a republic.\"\r\n\r\n\"If this be true, then Poland is lost, and there is no hope for the\r\nConfederates,\" replied the empress. \"I promised them protection against\r\nforeign aggression, but with their internal quarrels I will not\r\ninterfere.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be a dangerous precedent if Austria should justify those who\r\nlay sacrilegious hands upon the crown of their lawful sovereign; and,\r\nfor my part, my principles forbid me to uphold a band of rebels, who are\r\nengaged in an insolent conspiracy to dethrone their king.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, prince; it will never do for us to uphold them. As I\r\nhave openly declared my sympathy with the Confederates, so I must openly\r\nexpress to them my entire disapprobation of their republican\r\nproclivities.\"\r\n\r\n\"If your majesty does that, a war with France will be the consequence of\r\nyour frankness. France has promised succor to the Confederates, and has\r\nalready sent Dumouriez with troops, arms, and gold. France is longing to\r\nhave a voice in the differences between Russia and Turkey, and she only\r\nawaits cooperation from Austria to declare openly against Russia. She\r\nwill declare against ourselves, if, after your majesty's promises, we\r\nsuddenly change front and take part against the seditious Poles.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can we do, then, to avert war?\" cried the empress, anxiously. \"Ah,\r\nprince, you see that the days of my youth and my valor are past! I\r\nshudder when I look back upon the blood that has been shed under my\r\nreign, and nothing but the direst necessity will ever compel me to be\r\nthe cause of spilling another drop of Austrian blood. [Footnote: The\r\nempress's own words. F. V. Raumor, \"Contributions to Modern History.\"\r\nvol. iv., p. 419.] How, then, shall we shape our course so as to avoid\r\nwar?\"\r\n\r\n\"Our policy,\" said Kaunitz, \"is to do nothing. We must look on and be\r\nwatchful, while we carefully keep our own counsel. We propitiate France\r\nby allowing her to believe in the continuance of our sympathy with the\r\nPoles, while we pacify Russia and Prussia by remaining actually\r\nneutral.\"\r\n\r\n\"But while we temporize and equivocate,\" cried the empress, with fervor,\r\n\"Russia will annihilate the Poles, who, if they have gone too far in\r\ntheir thirst for freedom, have valiantly contended for their just\r\nrights, and are now about to lose them through the evils of disunion. It\r\ngrieves me to think that we are about to abandon an unhappy nation to\r\nthe oppression of that woman, who stops at nothing to compass her wicked\r\ndesigns. She who did not shrink from the murder of her own husband, do\r\nyou imagine that she will stop short of the annexation of Poland to\r\nRussia?\"\r\n\r\n\"We will not suffer her to annex Poland,\" said Kaunitz, slowly nodding\r\nhis head. \"As long as we are at peace with Russia, she will do nothing to\r\nprovoke our enmity; for France is at our side, and even Prussia would\r\nremonstrate, if Catharine should be so bold as to appropriate Poland to\r\nherself alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mistaken. The King of Prussia, who is so covetous of that which\r\nbelongs to others, will gladly share the booty with Russia,.\"\r\n\r\n\"Austria could never suffer the copartnership. If such an emergency\r\nshould arise, we would have to make up our minds to declare war against\r\nthem both, or--\"\r\n\r\n\"Or?\" asked the empress, holding her breath, as he paused.\r\n\r\n\"Or,\" said Kaunitz, fixing his cold blue eye directly upon her face, \"or\r\nwe would have to share with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Share what?\"\r\n\r\n\"The apple of discord. Anarchy is a three-headed monster; if it is to be\r\ndestroyed, every head must fall. It is now devouring Poland; and I think\r\nthat the three great powers are strong enough to slay the monster once\r\nfor all.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is all very plausible,\" said Maria Theresa, shaking her head, \"but\r\nit is not just. You will never convince me that good can be born of\r\nevil. What you propose is neither more nor less than to smite the\r\nsuppliant that lies helpless at your feet. I will have nothing in common\r\nwith the Messalina who desecrates her sovereignty by the commission of\r\nevery unwomanly crime; and as for Frederick of Prussia, I mistrust him.\r\nHe has been my enemy for too many years for me ever to believe that he\r\ncan be sincerely my friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"France was our enemy for three hundred years, and yet we are allied by\r\nmore than ordinary ties.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our alliance will soon come to naught if we walk in the path to which\r\nyou would lead us, prince. France will not be dear to the misery of\r\nPoland. She will hear the death-cry, and come to the rescue.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty, France will wait to see what we propose to do until\r\nit is too late, and she will perceive that a resort to arms will in no\r\nwise affect a fait accompli. I, therefore, repeat that the only way to\r\nprevent the Polish conflagration from spreading to other nations is for\r\nus to preserve a strict neutrality, taking part with neither disputant.\"\r\n\r\n\"War must be averted,\" exclaimed Maria Theresa, warmly. \"My first duty is\r\nto Austria, and Austria must have peace. To preserve this blessing to my\r\nsubjects, I will do any thing that is consistent with my honor and the\r\ndictates of my conscience.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, your majesty, diplomacy has no conscience; it can have but one\r\nrule--that of expediency.\"\r\n\r\n\"You concede, then, that the policy you advocate is not a conscientious\r\none?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty; but it is one which it is imperative for us to\r\nfollow. Necessity alone decides a national course of action. A good\r\nstatesman cannot be a cosmopolitan. He looks out for himself, and leaves\r\nothers to do the same. If Poland succumbs, it will be because she has\r\nnot the strength to live. Therefore, if her hour be come, let her die.\r\nWe dare not go to her relief, for, before the weal of other nations, we\r\nmust have peace and prosperity for Austria.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose that France should insist that we define our position?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we can do so--in words. It is so easy to hide one's thoughts,\r\nwhile we assure our allies of our 'distinguished consideration!'\"\r\n\r\nThe empress heaved a deep sigh.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said she, \"that clouds are gathering over the political\r\nhorizon, and that you are resolved to shield your own house, while the\r\ntempest devastates the home of your neighbor. Be it so. I must have\r\npeace; for I have no right to sacrifice my people before the altars of\r\nstrange gods. This is my first great obligation, and all other claims\r\nmust give way to it.--\r\n\r\n\"THEY MUST GIVE WAY,\" continued the empress, slowly communing with\r\nherself, \"but oh! it seems cruel. I scarcely dare ask myself what is to\r\nbe the fate of Poland? Heaven direct us, for all human wisdom has come\r\nto naught!\"\r\n\r\nThen, turning toward Kaunitz, she held out her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Go, prince,\" said she, \"and be assured that what we have spoken to each\r\nother to-day shall remain sacred between us.\"\r\n\r\nThe prince bowed, and left he room.\r\n\r\nThe empress was alone. She went to and fro, while her disturbed\r\ncountenance betrayed the violent struggle that was raging in her noble,\r\nhonest heart.\r\n\r\n\"I know what they want,\" murmured she. \"Joseph thirsts for glory and\r\nconquest, and Kautnitz upholds him. They want their share of the booty.\r\nAnd they will overrule my sympathy, and prove to me that I am bound to\r\ninaction. Poland will be dismembered, and I shall bear my portion of the\r\ncrime. I shudder at the deed, and yet I cannot raise my hand without\r\nshedding my people's blood. I must take counsel of Heaven!\"\r\n\r\nShe rang, and commanded the presence of her confessor.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he will throw some light upon this darkness, and the just God\r\nwill do the rest!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX.\r\n\r\nGOSSIP.\r\n\r\nThe Countess Wielopolska was alone in her room. She walked to and fro;\r\nsometimes stopping before a large pier-glass to survey her own person,\r\nsometimes hastening to the window, at the sound of a carriage passing\r\nby; then retiring disappointed as the vehicle went on.\r\n\r\n\"He comes late,\" thought she. \"Perhaps he has forgotten that he promised\r\nto come. Gracious Heaven! what, if he should be proof against the\r\nblandishments of woman! I fear me he is too cold--and Poland will be\r\nlost. And yet his eye, when it rests upon me, speaks the language of\r\nlove, and his hand trembles when it touches mine. Ah! And I--when he is\r\nby, I sometimes forget the great cause for which I live, and--no, no,\r\nno!\" exclaimed she aloud, \"it must not, shalt not be! My heart must know\r\nbut one love--the love of country. Away with such silly, girlish\r\ndreaming! I am ashamed--\"\r\n\r\nHere the countess paused, to listen again, for this time a carriage\r\nstopped before the door, and the little French clock struck the hour.\r\n\r\n\"He comes,\" whispered she, scarcely breathing, and she turned her bright\r\nsmiling face toward the door. It opened, and admitted a young woman\r\nwhose marvellous beauty was enhanced by all the auxiliaries of a superb\r\ntoilet and a profusion of magnificent jewels.\r\n\r\n\"Countess Zamoiska,\" exclaimed the disappointed hostess, coming forward,\r\nand striving to keep up the smile.\r\n\r\n\"And why such a cold reception, my dear Anna,\" asked the visitor, with a\r\nwarm embrace. \"Am I not always the same Luschinka, to whom you vowed\r\neternal friendship when we were school-girls together?\"\r\n\r\n\"We vowed eternal friendship,\" sighed the Countess Wielopolska, \"but\r\nsince we were happy school-girls, six years have gone by, and fearful\r\ntragedies have arisen to darken our lives and embitter our young\r\nhearts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw!\" said the lady, casting admiring glances at herself in the\r\nmirror. \"I do not know why these years should be so sad to you. They\r\nhave certainly improved your beauty, for I declare to you, Anna, that\r\nyou were scarcely as pretty when you left school as you are today. Am I\r\naltered for the worse? My heart, as you see, has not changed, for as\r\nsoon as I heard you were in Vienna, I flew to embrace you. What a pity,\r\nyour family would mix themselves up in those hateful politics! You might\r\nhave been the leader of fashion in Warsaw. And your stupid husband, too,\r\nto think of his killing himself on the very day of a masked ball, and\r\nspoiling the royal quadrille!\"\r\n\r\n\"The royal quadrille,\" echoed the countess, in an absent tone; \"yes, the\r\nking, General Repnin, he who put to death so many Polish nobles, and the\r\nbrutal Branicki, whose pastime it is to set fire to Polish villages,\r\nthey were to have been the other dancers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes and they completed their quadrille, in spite of Count Wielopolska.\r\nBibeskoi offered himself as a substitute, and sat up the whole night to\r\nlearn the figures. Bibeskoi is a delightful partner.\"\r\n\r\n\"A Russian,\" exclaimed the countess.\r\n\r\n\"What signifies a man's nation when he dances well?\" laughed the lady.\r\n\"Tris done, ma chere, are you still mad on the subject of politics? And\r\ndo you still sympathize with the poor crazy Confederates?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know, Luschinka, that Count Pac was my father's dearest friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it, poor man; he is at the top and bottom of all the trouble. I\r\nbeseech you, chere Anna, let us put aside politics; I cannot see what\r\npleasure a woman can find in such tiresome things. Mon Dieu, there are\r\nso many other things more pleasing as well as more important! For\r\ninstance: how do people pass their time in Vienna? Have you many lovers?\r\nDo you go to many balls?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think me so base that I could dance while Poland is in chains?\"\r\nsaid the countess, frowning.\r\n\r\nThe Countess Zamoiska laughed aloud. \"Voyons--are you going to play\r\nJeanne d'Arc to bring female heroism into fashion? Oh, Anna! We have\r\nnever had more delightful balls in Warsaw than have been given since so\r\nmany Russian regiments have been stationed there.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have danced with those who have murdered your brothers and\r\nrelatives?--danced while the people of Poland are trodden under foot!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, bah! Ne parlez pas du people!\" cried the Countess Zamoiska, with a\r\ngesture of disgust. \"A set of beastly peasants, no better than their own\r\ncattle, or a band of genteel robbers, who have made it unsafe to live\r\nanywhere on Polish soil, even in Warsaw.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" sighed the Countess Wielopolska, \"let us drop politics\r\nand speak of other things.\"\r\n\r\n\"A la bonne heure. Let us have a little chronique scandaleuse. Ah, ma\r\nchere, I am at home there, for we lead an enchanting life in Warsaw. The\r\nking is a handsome man, and, in spite of the Empress Catharine, his\r\nheart is still susceptible of the tender passion. You remember his\r\nliaison with the Countess Kanizka, your sister-in-law?\"\r\n\r\n\"A base, dishonored woman, who stooped to be the mistress of the man who\r\nhas betrayed her country!\"\r\n\r\n\"A king, nevertheless, and a very handsome man; and she was inconsolable\r\nwhen he ceased to love her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! she was abandoned, then, was she?\" cried the Countess Wielopolska.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, dear Anna! Your sister-in-law was not guilty of the belise of\r\nplaying Queen Dido. As she felt quite sure that the king would leave her\r\nsoon or late, she anticipated the day, and left him. Was it not\r\nexcellent? She went off with Prince Repnin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prince Repnin!\" exclaimed the countess with horror. \"The Russian\r\nambassador!\"\r\n\r\n\"The same. You should have seen the despair of the king. But he was\r\namiable even in his grief. He tried all sorts of lover's stratagems to\r\nwin back the countess; he prowled around her house at night singing like\r\na Troubadour; be wrote her bushels of letters to implore an interview.\r\nAll in vain. The liaison with Repnin was made public, and that, of\r\ncourse, ended the affair. The king was inconsolable. [Footnote: Wraxall,\r\n\"Memoirs of the Court of Vienna,\" vol. ii., p. 96.] He gave ball after\r\nball, never missed an evening at the theatre, gambled all night, gave\r\nsleighing parties, and so on, but it was easy to see that his heart was\r\nbroken; and had not Tissona, the pretty cantatrice, succeeded in\r\ncomforting him, I really do believe that our handsome king would have\r\nkilled himself for despair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, he is consoled, is he?\" said the countess with curling lips. \"He\r\njests and dances, serenades and gambles, while the gory knout reeks with\r\nthe noblest blood in Poland, and her noblest sons are staggering along\r\nthe frozen wastes of Siberia! Oh Stanislaus! Stanislaus! A day of\r\nreckoning will come for him who wears the splendor of royalty, yet casts\r\naway its obligations!\"\r\n\r\n\"Vraiment, dear Anna, to hear your rhapsodies, one would almost believe\r\nyou to be one of the Confederates who lately attempted the life of the\r\nking,\" cried the Countess Zamoiska, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Who attempted the king's life?\" said the countess, turning pale.\r\n\r\n\"Why three robbers: Lukawski, Strawinski, and Kosinski.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never heard of it,\" replied the countess, much agitated. \"Tell me\r\nwhat you know of it, if you can, Luschinka.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is an abominable thing, and long too,\" said Luschinka, with a shrug.\r\n\"The conspirators were disguised as peasants, and actually had the\r\nassurance to come to Warsaw. There were thirty of them, but the three I\r\ntell you of were the leaders. The king was on his way to his uncle's\r\npalace, which is in the suburbs of Warsaw. They had the insolence to\r\nfall upon him in the streets, and his attendants got frightened and ran\r\noff. Then the conspirators tore the king from his coach and carried him\r\noff, swearing that if he uttered one cry they would murder him. Wasn't\r\nit awful? Do you think that the dear king didn't have the courage to\r\nkeep as quiet as a mouse while they took him off with them to the forest\r\nof Bielani? Here they robbed him of all he had, leaving him nothing but\r\nthe ribbon that belonged to the order of the White Eagle. Then they\r\ndispersed to give the news of his capture to their accomplices, and\r\nKosinski was left to dispatch him. Did you ever!\"\r\n\r\n\"Further, further!\" said the countess, scarcely able to speak, as her\r\nold school-mate paused in her narrative.\r\n\r\nLuschinka laughed. \"Doesn't it sound just like a fairy tale, Anna? But\r\nit is as true as I live, and happened on the third of November of this\r\nblessed year 1771. So Kosinski and six others dragged and dragged the\r\nking until he lost his shoes, and was all torn and scratched, and even\r\nwounded. Whenever the others wanted to stop and kill the king, Kosinski\r\nobjected that the place was not lonely enough. All at once they came\r\nupon the Russian patrol. Then the five other murderers ran off, leaving\r\nthe king and Kosinski alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Kosinski?\" asked the countess, with anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"Kusinski went on with his sword drawn over the king's head, although he\r\nbegged him for rest. But the king saw that Kosinski looked undecided and\r\nuneasy, so as they came near to the Convent of Bielani, he said to\r\nKosinski, 'I see that you don't know which way to act, so you had\r\nbetter let me go into the convent to hide, while you make your escape by\r\nsome other way.' But Kosinski said no, he had sworn to kill him. So they\r\nwent on farther, until they came to Mariemont, a castle belonging to the\r\nElector of Saxony. Here the king begged for rest, and they sat down and\r\nbegan to talk. Then Kosinkski told the king he was not killing him of\r\nhis own will, but because he had been ordered to do so by others, to\r\npunish the king for all his sins, poor fellow! against Poland. The king\r\nthen said it was not his fault, but all the fault of Russia, and at last\r\nhe softened the murderer's heart. Kosinski threw himself at the king's\r\nfeet and begged pardon, and promised to save him. So Stanislaus promised\r\nto forgive him, and it was all arranged between them. They went on to a\r\nmill near Mariemont, and begged the miller to let in two travellers who\r\nhad lost their way. At first the miller took them to be robbers, but\r\nafter a great deal of begging, he let them in. Then the king tore a leaf\r\nout of his pocket-book, and wrote a note to General Cocceji. The\r\nmiller's daughter took it to Warsaw, not without much begging on the\r\nking's part; and you can conceive the joy of the people when they heard\r\nthat the king was safe, for everybody seeing his cloak in the streets,\r\nand his hat and plume on the road, naturally supposed that he had been\r\nmurdered. Well, General Cocceji, followed by the whole court, hurried to\r\nthe mill; and when they arrived, there was Kosinski standing before the\r\ndoor with a drawn sword in his hand. He let in the general, and there on\r\nthe floor, in the miller's shirt, lay the king fast asleep. So Cocceji\r\nwent down on his knees and kissed his hand, and called him his lord and\r\nking, and the people of the mill, who had never dreamed who it was, all\r\ndropped on their knees and begged for mercy. So the king then forgave\r\neverybody, and went back to Warsaw with Cocceji. This, my dear, is a\r\ntrue history of the attempt that was made by the Confederates on the\r\nlife of the handsomest man in Poland!\" [Footnote: Wraxall, \"Memoirs,\"\r\nvol. ii., p. 76.]\r\n\r\n\"A strange and sad history,\" said the Countess Anna. \"However guilty the\r\nking may be, it would be disgraceful if he were murdered by his own\r\nsubjects.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my love, these Confederates refuse to acknowledge him for their\r\nking! Did you not know that they had been so ridiculous as to depose\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"What have the Confederates to do with a band of robbers who plundered\r\nthe king and would have murdered him?\" asked Anna indignantly.\" Are they\r\nto be made answerable for the crimes of a horde of banditti?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ma chere, the banditti were the tools of the Confederates. They have\r\nbeen taken, and every thing has been discovered. Pulawski, their great\r\nhero, hired the assassins and bound them by an oath. Letters found upon\r\nLukawski, who boasts of his share in the villany, shows that Pulawski\r\nwas the head conspirator, and that the plot had been approved by Zaremba\r\nand Pac!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then all is lost!\" murmured Anna. \"If the Confederates have sullied the\r\nhonor of Poland by consenting to crime as a means to work out her\r\nindependence, Poland will never regain her freedom. Oh, that I should\r\nhave lived to see this day!\"\r\n\r\nShe covered her face with her hands, and sobbed aloud.\r\n\r\n\"Vraiment, Anna,\" said the Countess Zamoiska pettishly, \"I cannot\r\nunderstand you. Instead of rejoicing over the king's escape, here you\r\nbegin to cry over the sins of his murderers. All Poland is exasperated\r\nagainst them, and nothing can save them. [Footnote: Lukawski and\r\nStrawinski were executed. They died cursing Kosinski as a traitor.\r\nWraxall, vol. ii., p. 83.] So, dear Anna, dry your eyes, or they will be\r\nas red as a cardinal's hat. Goodness me, if I hadn't wonderful strength\r\nof mind, I might have cried myself into a fright long ago; for you have\r\nno idea of the sufferings I have lived through. You talk of Poland, and\r\nnever ask a word about myself. It shows how little interest you feel in\r\nme, that you still call me by the name of my first husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you married a second time?\" asked Anna, raising her head.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, ma chere, my name has not been Zamoiska for four years. Dear me!\r\nThe king knows what misery it is to be tied to a person that loves you\r\nno longer; and luckily for us, he has the power of divorce. He does it\r\nfor the asking, and every divorce is a signal for a succession of\r\nbrilliant balls; for you understand that people don't part to go on and\r\npout. They marry at once, and, of course everybody gives balls, routs,\r\nand dinners, in honor of the weddings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you married again in this way?\" asked the countess, gravely.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" replied the unconscious Luschinka; \"I have been twice married\r\nand twice divorced; but it was not my fault. I loved my first husband\r\nwith a depth of passion which he could not appreciate, and I was in an\r\nagony of despair when six months after our marriage he told me that he\r\nloved me no longer, and was dying for the Countess Luwiendo. She was my\r\nbosom friend, so you can imagine my grief; mais j'ai su faire bonne mine\r\na mauvais jeux. I invited the countess to my villa, and there, under the\r\nshade of the old trees in the park, we walked arm in arm, and arranged\r\nwith my husband all the conditions of the separation. Every one praised\r\nmy generous conduct; the men in particular were in raptures, and Prince\r\nLubomirski, on the strength of it, fell so desperately in love with me,\r\nthat he divorced his wife and offered me his hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did not accept it!\" exclaimed Countess Anna.\r\n\r\n\"What a question!\" said the ex-countess, pouting. \"The prince was young,\r\nrich, charming and a great favorite with the king. We loved each other,\r\nand, of course, were married. But, indeed, my dear, love does seem to\r\nhave such butterfly wings that you scarcely catch it before it is gone!\r\nMy second husband broke my heart exactly as my first had done; he asked\r\nme to leave him, and of course I had to go. Men are abominable beings,\r\nAnna: scarcely were we divorced before he married a third wife.\"\r\n[Footnote: Wraxall, ii., p. 110.]\r\n\r\n\"Poland is lost--lost!\" murmured the Countess Anna. \"She is falling\r\nunder the weight of her children's crimes. Lost! O Poland, my unhappy\r\ncountry!\"\r\n\r\n\"Au contraire, ma chere, Warsaw was never gayer than it is at present.\r\nDid I not tell you that every divorce was followed by a marriage, and\r\nthat the king was delighted with the masquerades and balls, and all that\r\nsort of thing? Why, nothing is heard in Warsaw at night but laughter,\r\nmusic, and the chink of glasses.\"\r\n\r\n\"And nevertheless you could tear yourself away\" said the Countess\r\nironically.\r\n\r\n\"I had to go,\" sighed the princess. \"I am on my way to Italy. You see,\r\nma chere, it would have been inconvenient and might have made me\r\nridiculous to go out in society, meeting my husbands with their two\r\nwives, and I--abandoned by both these faithless men. I should have been\r\nobliged to marry a third time, but my heart revolted against it.\" \"Then\r\nyou travel alone to Italy?\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means, mon amour, I am travelling with the most bewitching\r\ncreature!--my lover. Oh, Anna, he is the handsomest man I ever laid my\r\neyes upon; the most delightful! and he paints so divinely that the\r\nEmpress Catharine has appointed him her court painter. I love him beyond\r\nall expression; I adore him! You need not smile, Anna, que voulez-vous?\r\nLe coeur toujours vierge pour un second amour.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you love him so dearly, why, then, does your heart revolt against a\r\nmarriage with him?\" asked the Countess Anna.\r\n\r\n\"I told you he was a painter, and not a nobleman,\" answered the\r\nex-princess, impatiently. \"One loves an artist, but cannot marry him. Do\r\nyou suppose I would be so ridiculous as to give up my title to be the\r\nrespectable wife of a painter? The Princess Lubomirski a Madame Wand,\r\nsimple Wand! Oh, no! I shall travel with him, but I will not marry him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then go!\" exclaimed the Countess Anna, rising, and casting looks of\r\nscorn upon the princess. \"Degenerate daughter of a degenerate\r\nfatherland, go, and drag your shame with you to Italy! Go, and enjoy\r\nyour sinful lusts, while Poland breathes her last, and vultures prey\r\nupon her dishonored corpse. But take with you the contempt of every\r\nPolish heart, that beats with love for the land that gave you birth!\"\r\n\r\nShe turned, and without a word of farewell, proudly left the room. The\r\nprincess raised her brow and opened her pretty mouth in bewilderment;\r\nthen rising, and going up to the mirror, she smoothed her hair and began\r\nto laugh.\r\n\r\n\"What a pathetic fool!\" said she. \"Anybody might know that her mother\r\nhad been an actress. To think of the daughter of an artiste getting up a\r\nscene because a princess will not stoop to marry a painter! Queulle\r\nbetise!\"\r\n\r\nWith these words she went back to her carriage and drove off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI.\r\n\r\nAN EXPLANATION.\r\n\r\nThe Countess Anna, meanwhile, had retired to her room. Exhausted by her\r\nown emotions, she sank into a chair, and clasping her hands\r\nconvulsively, she stared, with distended eyes, upon the blank wall\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\nShe was perfectly unconscious that, after a time, the door had opened\r\nand Matuschka stood before her. It was not until the old woman had taken\r\nher hand and raised it to her lips, that she started from her mournful\r\nreverie.\r\n\r\n\"What now, Matuschka?\" said she, awakening from her dream.\r\n\r\n\"My lady, I come to know what we are to do. The pearl necklace and\r\nwreath are sold, and they have maintained the Countess Wielopolska as\r\nbeseems her rank; but we live upon our capital, and it lessens every\r\nday. Oh, my lady, why will you conceal your poverty, when the emperor--\"\r\n\r\n\"Peace!\" interrupted the countess. \"When we speak of our poverty don't\r\nname the emperor. If there is no more money in our purse, take the\r\ndiadem of brilliants, sell the diamonds and replace them with false\r\nstones. They will bring a thousand ducats, and that sum will last us for\r\na whole year.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\" sobbed Matuschka.\r\n\r\n\"And then,\" echoed the countess, thoughtfully, \"then we will either be\r\nhappy or ready for death. Go, Matuschka, let no one know that I am\r\nselling my diamonds; but replace them by to-morrow morning; for I must\r\nwear them at the emperor's reception.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your whole set, pearls and diamonds, are now false,\" said the\r\npersevering servant. \"What will the emperor say when he hears of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"He must never know of it. Now go, and return quickly.\"\r\n\r\nMatuschka, looking almost angrily at her lady, left the room. In the\r\nanteroom stood a man wrapped in a cloak. She went quickly up to him with\r\nthe open etui.\r\n\r\n\"The diamond coronet,\" whispered she. \"I am to sell the jewels and have\r\ntheir places filled with false ones. It is to be done before to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much does she expect for it?\" asked the visitor in a low voice\r\n\r\n\"A thousand ducats, sire.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will send the sum to-night. Hide the coronet until to-morrow and then\r\nreturn it to her. Where is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"In her cabinet, your majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let no one enter until I return.\"\r\n\r\nHe then threw down his cloak, and without knocking opened the door. The\r\ncountess was still lost in thought. She still gazed at the blank wall,\r\nstill heard the flippant voice which had poured out its profanity as\r\nthough life had been a jest and immorality a dream.\r\n\r\nThe emperor stopped to contemplate her for a moment, and his large,\r\nloving eyes rested fondly on her noble form.\r\n\r\n\"Countess Anna,\" said he, softly.\r\n\r\n\"The emperor!\" exclaimed she, rising and coming joyfully forward, while\r\na deep blush overspread her face.\r\n\r\n\"What! Will you not respect my incognito? Will you not receive me as\r\nCount Falkenstein?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is not the name of the emperor the first that is pronounced by the\r\npriest when he prays before the altar for his fellow-creatures?\" replied\r\nshe, with an enchanting smile. \"Think of my heart as a priest, and let\r\nthat name be ever the first I speak in my prayers to Heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"By heaven, if priests resembled you, I should not hate them as I do.\r\nCome, my lovely priestess, then call me emperor if you will, but receive\r\nme as Count Falkenstein.\"\r\n\r\n\"Welcome, count,\" replied she, cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"God be praised, then, my royalty has disappeared for a while,\" said\r\nJoseph.\r\n\r\n\"And yet, my lord and emperor, it is the privilege of royalty to heal\r\nall wounds, to wipe away all tears, and to comfort all sorrow. What a\r\nmagnificent prerogative it is to hold in one's own hand the happiness of\r\nthousands?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is happiness, sweet moralist?\" cried Joseph. \"Mankind are forever\r\nin search of it, yet no man has ever found it.\" \"What is happiness!\"\r\nexclaimed she, with enthusiasm. \"It is to have the power of ruling\r\ndestiny--it is to stand upon the Himalaya of your might; when,\r\nstretching forth your imperial hand, you can say to the oppressed among\r\nnations, 'Come unto me, ye who strive against tyranny, and I will give\r\nyou freedom!'\"\r\n\r\n\"In other words,\" replied the emperor, with an arch smile, \"it is to\r\nmarch to Poland and give battle to the Empress of Russia.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, it is!\" cried she, with the fervor of a Miriam. \"It is to be the\r\nMessiah of crucified Freedom, to redeem your fellows from bondage, and\r\nto earn the blessings of a people to whom your name, for all time, will\r\nstand as the type of all that is great in a sovereign and good in a man!\r\nOh, Emperor of Austria, be the generous redeemer of my country!\"\r\n\r\nAnd scarcely knowing what she said, she took his hand and pressed it to\r\nher heart.\r\n\r\nJoseph withdrew it gently, saying, \"Peace, lovely enthusiast, peace!\r\nGive politics to the winds! She is an abominable old hag, and the very\r\nrustling of her sibylline leaves as she turns them over in the cabinet\r\nof the empress makes me shudder with disgust. Let us drive her hence,\r\nthen. I came hither to taste a few drops of happiness at YOUR side,\r\nsweet Anna.\"\r\n\r\nThe countess sighed wearily as the emperor drew her to his side; and her\r\npale, inspired face was turned upon him with a look of unutterable\r\nanguish.\r\n\r\nThe emperor saw it, and leaned his head back upon the cushion of the\r\nsofa. After a pause he said: \"How sweet it is to be here!\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet you came late,\" whispered she, reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\"Because I travelled by a circuitous route; got into one hackney-coach\r\nand out of another; drove hither, thither, and everywhere, to baffle my\r\nmother's spies. Do you suppose that any one of her bigoted followers\r\nwould believe in a chaste friendship like ours? Do you suppose they\r\nwould understand the blameless longings I have to see your lovely face,\r\nand to listen to the melody of your matchless voice? Tell me, Countess\r\nAnna, how have I deserved the rich boon of your friendship?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, Count Falkenstein,\" replied she, with a bewitching smile, \"tell me\r\nhow I have earned yours? Moreover, who tells you that I am disinterested\r\nin my sentiments? The day may come when you will understand how entirely\r\nI rely upon you for assistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have not given your friendship exclusively for the sake of the\r\nday that may come? Have you?\" said the emperor, with a piercing glance\r\nat her beautiful pale face.\r\n\r\nThe countess cast down her eyes and blushed. \"Do you mistrust me?\" asked\r\nshe in a low, trembling voice.\r\n\r\n\"Give me a proof of your confidence in me,\" said Joseph, rising and\r\ntaking both her hands in his. \"You call me friend--give me, then, the\r\nright of a friend. Let me in some degree replace to you the fortune of\r\nwhich the Russian empress has robbed you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mistaken, sire,\" said the countess, proudly; \"the Russian did\r\nnot rob me of every thing. She took my lands, but I have invested funds\r\nin foreign securities which yield me an ample income. I have also my\r\nfamily jewels, and as long as you see me wearing them you may feel sure\r\nthat I have other means of support.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor shook his head. \"You are not wearing your family jewels,\r\nAnna,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"How, sire!\" exclaimed she, blushing.\r\n\r\nHe leaned over, and in a low voice said, \"Your jewels are false, your\r\npearls are imitation, and there is not a single diamond in that coronet\r\nyou intend to wear at my mother's reception to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nThe cheeks of the countess grew scarlet with confusion, and her head\r\ndropped with shame. The emperor laid his hand upon her arm. \"Now, Anna,\"\r\nsaid he, tenderly, \"now that I know all, grant me the happiness of\r\nrelieving you from your temporary embarrassments. Gracious Heaven! You\r\nwho are not ashamed to confide your distress to pawnbrokers and\r\njewellers, you refuse to trust ME!\"\r\n\r\n\"I would rather be under obligations to a stranger than to a friend,\"\r\nreturned the countess in a voice scarcely audible.\r\n\r\n\"But, Anna,\" cried the emperor, with a sudden burst of feeling, \"you\r\nwould rattler be obliged to the man whom you loved than to a stranger.\r\nOh, if you but loved me, there would be no question of 'mine or thine'\r\nbetween us! It is said--I have betrayed myself, and I need stifle my\r\npassion no longer; for I love you, beautiful Anna, I love you from my\r\nsoul, and, at your feet, I implore you to give me that which is above\r\nall wealth or titles. Give me your love, be mine. Answer me, answer me.\r\nDo you love me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" whispered she, without raising her head.\r\n\r\nThe emperor threw his arm around her waist. \"Then,\" said he, \"from this\r\nhour you give me the right to provide for you. Do you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sire, I can provide for myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" cried Joseph, angrily, \"you do not love me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire, I love you. You predicted that my heart would find its\r\nmaster. It has bowed before you and owns your sway. In the name of that\r\nlove I crave help for Poland. She cries to Heaven for vengeance, and\r\nHeaven has not heard the cry. She is threatened by Russia and Prussia,\r\nand if noble Austria abandon her, she is lost! Oh, generous Austria,\r\nrescue my native land from her foes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed the emperor, sarcastically, \"you call me Austria, and\r\nyour love is bestowed upon my station and my armies! It is not I whom\r\nyou love, but that Emperor of Austria in whose hand lies the power that\r\nmay rescue Poland. \"\r\n\r\n\"I love YOU; but my love is grafted upon the hope I so long have\r\ncherished that in you I recognize the savior of my country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" cried the emperor, with a sneer.\r\n\r\nThe countess did not hear him. She continued: \"Until I loved you, every\r\nthrob of my heart belonged to Poland. She, alone, was the object of my\r\nlove and of my prayers. But since then, sire, the holy fire that burned\r\nupon the altar is quenched. I am faithless to my vestal vow, and I feel\r\nwithin my soul the tempest of an earthly passion. I have broken the oath\r\nthat I made to my dying mother, for there is one more dear to me than\r\nPoland now, and for him are the prayers, the hopes, the longings, and\r\nthe dreams that all belonged to Poland! Oh, my lord and my lover,\r\nreconcile me to my conscience! Let me believe that my loves are one; and\r\non the day when your victorious eagles shall have driven away the\r\nvultures that prey upon my fatherland, I will throw myself at your feet,\r\nand live for your love alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, indeed,\" said the emperor, with a sardonic laugh: \"you will go to\r\nsuch extremity in your patriotism! You will sell yourself, that Poland\r\nmay be redeemed through your dishonor. I congratulate you upon your\r\ndexterous statesmanship. You sought me, I perceive, that by the magic of\r\nyour intoxicating beauty, you might lure me to sacrifice the lives of my\r\npeople in behalf of yours. Your love is a stratagem of diplomacy,\r\nnothing more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sire,\" cried she, in tones of anguish, \"you despise then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all; I admire your policy, but unhappily it is only partially\r\nsuccessful. You had calculated that I would not be proof against your\r\nbeauty, your talents, your fascinations. You are right; I am taken in\r\nthe snare, for I love you madly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do I not return your love from my heart?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"Stay,\" cried Joseph, \"hear me out. One-half your policy, I say, was\r\nsuccessful; the other has been at fault. As your lover I will do any\r\nthing that man can do to make you happy; but my head belongs to my\r\nfatherland, and you cannot rule it, through my heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, I seek nothing that is inconsistent with Austria's welfare. I ask\r\nhelp for Poland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which help might involve Austria in a ruinous war with two powerful\r\nnations, and leave her so exhausted that she would have to stand by and\r\nwitness the partition of Poland without daring to claim a share for\r\nherself.\"\r\n\r\n\"The partition of Poland!\" exclaimed the countess, with a cry of horror.\r\n\"Avenging God, wilt Thou suffer such culmination of human wickedness!\r\nAnd you, sire, could you share in such a crime? But, no! no! no!--see\r\nhow misfortune has maddened me, when I doubt the honor of the noble\r\nEmperor of Austria! Never would the lofty and generous Joseph stoop to\r\nsuch infamy as this!\"\r\n\r\n\"If Poland must succumb, I will act as becomes my station and\r\nresponsibilities as the sovereign of a great empire, and I will do that\r\nwhich the wisdom and prudence of my mother shall dictate to her son. But\r\nAnna, dear Anna,\" continued he, passionately, \"why should the sweet\r\nconfession of our love be lost in the turbid roar of these political\r\nwaters? Tell me that you love me as a woman ought to love, having no\r\nGod, no faith, no country, but her lover; losing her identity and living\r\nfor his happiness alone!\"\r\n\r\n\"I love you, I love you,\" murmured she, with indescribable tenderness;\r\nand clasping her hands, she fell upon her knees and raised her eyes to\r\nhim with a look that made him long to fold her to his heart, and yield\r\nup his empire, had she requested it, at his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Help for Poland,\" prayed she again, \"help for Poland, and I am yours\r\nforever!\"\r\n\r\nJoseph grew angry with himself and with her. \"Love does not chaffer,\"\r\nsaid he, rudely. \"When a woman loves, she must recognize her master and\r\nbow before his will--otherwise there is no love. For the last time I\r\nask, do you love me?\"\r\n\r\n\"More than life or honor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then be a woman, and yield yourself to me. Away with nationality--it\r\nis an abstraction. What are Poland and the world to you? Here, upon my\r\nheart, are your country and your altars. Come, without condition and\r\nwithout reserve. I cannot promise to free Poland, but, by the bright\r\nheaven above us, I swear to make you happy!\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head mournfully, and rose from her knees.\r\n\r\n\"Make me happy?\" echoed she. \"For me there can be no happiness while\r\nPoland sorrows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say that again,\" thundered the emperor, \"and we part forever!\"\r\n\r\n\"I say it again!\" said she, with proud tranquillity, but pale as death.\r\n\r\n\"And yet, if I am not ready to sacrifice my own people for yours, you\r\nwill not believe in my love! You are unwilling to give up an idle dream\r\nof Polish freedom; and you ask of me, a man and an emperor, that I shall\r\nbring to you the offering of my own honor and of my people's happiness!\"\r\n\r\nShe said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"It is enough!\" cried Joseph, his eyes flashing with anger. \"Pride\r\nagainst pride! We part. For the first thing I require of a woman who\r\nloves me, is submission. It grieves me bitterly to find you so\r\nunwomanly. I would have prized your love above every earthly blessing,\r\nhad you given it freely. Conditionally I will not accept it; above all,\r\nwhen its conditions relate to the government of my empire. No woman\r\nshall ever have a voice in my affairs of state. If, for that reason, she\r\nreject me, I must submit; although, as at this moment, my heart bleeds\r\nat her rejection.\"\r\n\r\n\"And mine? MY HEART?\" exclaimed the countess, raising her tearful eyes\r\nto his.\r\n\r\n\"Pride will cure you,\" replied he, with a bitter smile. \"Go back to your\r\nfatherland that you love so well and I shall imitate you, and turn to\r\nmine for comfort. There is many a mourning heart in Austria less haughty\r\nthan yours, to which, perchance, I may be able to bring joy or\r\nconsolation. God grant me some compensation in life for the supreme\r\nmisery of this hour! Farewell, Countess Wielopolska. To-night I leave\r\nVienna.\"\r\n\r\nHe crossed the room, while she looked after him as though her lips were\r\nparting to utter a cry.\r\n\r\nAt the door he turned once more to say farewell. Still she spoke not a\r\nword, but looked as though, like Niobe, she were stiffening into marble.\r\n\r\nThe emperor opened the door, and passed into the anteroom.\r\n\r\nAs he disappeared, she uttered a low cry, and clasped both her hands\r\nover her heart.\r\n\r\n\"My God! my God! I love him,\" sobbed she, and reeling backward, she fell\r\nfainting to the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXII\r\n\r\nFAMINE IN BOHEMIA.\r\n\r\nThe cry of distress from Bohemia reached Vienna, and came to the\r\nknowledge of the emperor. Joseph hastened to bring succor and comfort to\r\nhis unhappy subjects.\r\n\r\nThe need great. Two successive years of short harvest had spread want\r\nand tribulation throughout all Germany, especially in Bohemia and\r\nMoravia, where a terrible inundation, added to the failure of the crops,\r\nhad destroyed the fruits and vegetables of every field and every little\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nThe country was one vast desert. From every cottage went forth the wail\r\nof hunger. The stalls were empty of cattle, the barns of corn. The\r\nploughs lay empty on the ground, for there was neither grain to sow nor\r\noxen to drive. There were neither men nor women to till the soil, for\r\nthere was no money to pay nor food to sustain them. Each man was alone\r\nin his want, and each sufferer in the egotism of a misery that stifled\r\nall humanity, complained that no one fed him, when all were fainting for\r\nlack of food.\r\n\r\n\"Bread! bread!\" The dreadful cry arose from hundreds of emaciated\r\nbeings, old and young, who, in the crowded cities, lay dying in the\r\nstreets, their wasted hands raised in vain supplication to the\r\npassers-by.\r\n\r\n\"Bread! bread!\" moaned the peasant in his hut, and the villager at the\r\nway-side; as with glaring eyes they stared at the traveller, who, more\r\nfortunate than they, was leaving Bohemia for happier climes, and,\r\nsurely, in gratitude for his own rescue, would throw a crust to the\r\nstarving wretches whom he left behind.\r\n\r\nThere they lay, watching for the elegant carriages, the horsemen, the\r\nwagons, that were accustomed to pass there on their road to Prague. But\r\nnow the high-road was empty, for the famine had extended to Prague, and\r\nno one cared to go thither.\r\n\r\nAnd yet on either side of the road were hundreds of beings who long ago\r\nhad left their miserable huts, and now lay in heaps upon the ground, the\r\nheavens their only shelter, the wide world their home. These were the\r\ninhabitants of the mountains, who had come down to the neighboring\r\nvillages for help, but had been rudely driven away by those whose\r\nsufferings had maddened them, and turned their hearts to stone.\r\n\r\nThey had lain there for a day, and yet not one trace of a traveller had\r\nthey seen. The mid-day sun had blistered their foreheads, but they had\r\nnot felt it, for the fiery pangs of hunger were keener than the sun; and\r\nnow the evening air that fanned their burning brows, brought no relief,\r\nfor fiercer and more cruel grew the gnawings of the fiend within.\r\n\r\n\"There is no help on earth,\" cried an old woman, the grandmother of a\r\nwhole generation of stalwart mountaineers who lay stricken around her.\r\nThere were her son and his wife, once such a stately pair, now reduced\r\nto two pale spectres; there were troops of grandchildren, once\r\nround-cheeked as the carved angels on the altar of the village chapel,\r\nnow hollow-eyed and skinny, with their blanched faces upturned\r\nimploringly to the parents who were scarcely conscious of their presence\r\nthere. Hunger had extinguished youth, strength, beauty, and had almost\r\nuprooted love. Not only had it destroyed their bodies, but it had even\r\ncorrupted their souls.\r\n\r\n\"There is no help on earth,\" cried the old woman again, with such energy\r\nof despair that her voice found its way to the dull ear of every\r\nsufferer around. And now from every hollow voice came back the mournful\r\nchorus, \"There is no help on earth!\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no help in heaven!\" shrieked an old man, who with his family\r\nwas lying in a hollow, whence their moans were heard as though coming\r\nfrom the grave. \"There is no God in heaven, else He would hear our\r\ncries? There is no God!\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no God!\" echoed the maddened wretches, and many a wasted arm\r\nwas raised in defiance to heaven.\r\n\r\n\"Peace, peace, my friends!\" cried the grandmother, \"let us not sin\r\nbecause we starve. We can but die, and the Lord will receive us!\" And as\r\nshe spoke, she raised her trembling body and stretched forth her poor,\r\nwithered arms, as though she would have calmed the tempest she had\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n\"Peace, Father Martin!\" cried she, in a voice of authority. \"There is a\r\nGod above, but He has turned away His face because of our sins. Let us\r\npray to see the light of His countenance. Come, friends, let its gather\r\nup all our strength and pray.\"\r\n\r\nShe arose and knelt, while, inspired by her example, the multitude knelt\r\nalso. Old and young, men and women, all with one supreme effort lifted\r\nup their hands to heaven.\r\n\r\nBut the prayer was over, the petitioners fell prostrate to the earth,\r\nand still no sign of help from above!\r\n\r\n\"You see, Mother Elizabeth,\" groaned Father Martin, \"your prayers are\r\nall in vain. Heaven is empty, and we must die.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must die, we must die!\" howled the famishing multitude, and,\r\nexhausted by the might of their own despair, they fell to rise no more.\r\nA long, tearful silence ensued. Here and there a faint moan struggled\r\nfor utterance, and a defiant arm was raised as though to threaten\r\nOmnipotence; then the poor, puny creatures, whom hunger had bereft of\r\nreason, shivered, dropped their hands, and again lay still.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the silence was broken by the faint sound of carriage-wheels.\r\nNearer and more near it came, until the horses' heads were to be seen\r\nthrough the clouds of dust that enveloped the vehicle. The poor peasants\r\nheard, but scarcely heeded it. They stared in mute despair, or\r\nmurmured, \"It is too late!\"\r\n\r\nStill the carriage rolled on, the dust grew thicker, and now it hid from\r\nthe travellers' view the miserable wretches that lay dying around them.\r\nBut. Heaven be praised, they stop!\r\n\r\nThere were two carriages, followed by outriders. The first carriage\r\ncontained three persons, all clad in dark, plain civilian's clothes; but\r\nit was easy to recognize, in the youngest of the three, the most\r\nimportant personage of all. It was he who had given the order to halt,\r\nand now without waiting for assistance, he leaped from the carriage and\r\nwalked at once to the foremost group of sufferers. He bent down to, the\r\nold woman, who, turning her fever-stricken face to him, moaned feebly.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" said the traveller, in a gentle and sympathizing\r\ntone. \"How can I help you?\"\r\n\r\nThe old mother made a violent effort and spoke. \"Hunger!\" said she. \"I\r\nburn--burn--hunger!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hunger! hunger!\" echoed the people around, shaking off their lethargy,\r\nand awakening once more to hope.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my God, this woman will die before we can succor her!\" exclaimed\r\nthe young man, sorrowfully. \"Hasten; Lacy, and bring me some wine.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have none,\" replied Lacy. \"Your majesty gave away your last bottle\r\nin the village behind.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she will die!\" exclaimed the emperor, as bending over the poor old\r\nwoman, he took her skinny hand in his.\r\n\r\n\"We must die,\" murmured she, while her parched tongue protruded from her\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n\"Sire, you are in danger,\" whispered Lacy,\r\n\r\n\"Rise, your majesty,\" interrupted Rosenberg, \"these unhappy people have\r\nthe typhus that accompanies starvation, and it is contagious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Contagious for those who hunger, but not for us,\" replied Joseph. \"Oh,\r\nmy friends,\" continued he, \"see here are three generations all dying for\r\nwant of food. Gracious Heaven! They have lost all resemblance to\r\nhumanity. Hunger has likened them to animals. Oh, it is dreadful to\r\nthink that a crust of bread or a sip of wine might awaken these\r\nsuffering creatures to reason; but flour and grain can be of no avail\r\nhere!\"\r\n\r\n\"They may avail elsewhere, sire,\" said Rosenberg, \"and if we can do\r\nnothing for these, let us go on and help others.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is fearful,\" said the emperor, \"but I will not leave until I have\r\nmade an effort to save them.\"\r\n\r\nHe signed to one of his outriders, and taking out a leaf of his\r\npocket-book, wrote something upon it. \"Gallop for your life to Prague,\"\r\nsaid he, \"and give this paper to the lord steward of the palace. He must\r\nat once send a wagon hither, laden with food and wine, and that he may\r\nbe able to do it without delay, tell him to take the stores from the\r\npalace and all the viands that are preparing in the kitchen for my\r\nreception. This paper will be your warrant. As soon as you shall have\r\ndelivered your message, fill a portmanteau with old Hungarian wine and\r\ngallop back to me. Be here within two hours, if you kill two of my best\r\nhorses to compass the distance.\"\r\n\r\nThe outrider took the paper and, setting spurs to his horse, galloped\r\noff to Prague.\r\n\r\n\"And now, my friends,\" continued the emperor, \"although we have no wine,\r\nwe have bread and meat. Not much, it is true, but I think it will save\r\nthese people from death.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor hastened in the direction of his carriage. \"Quick, Gunther,\r\nhand me the camp-chest.\"\r\n\r\n\"But your majesty has not eaten a morsel to-day,\" urged Rosenberg,\r\nfollowing him. \"I cannot consent to see the food prepared for you,\r\nbestowed upon any one. You will lose your health if you fast for such a\r\nlength of time. You owe it to your mother, the empress, and to your\r\nsubjects, not to deprive yourself of food.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I could eat in the presence of such hunger?\" cried the\r\nemperor, impatiently. \"Come, Gunther, come all of you, and help me. Here\r\nis a large fowl. Cut it into little morsels, and--oh, what a\r\ndiscovery!--a jar of beef jelly. While you carve the fowl, I will\r\ndistribute the jelly. Come, Lacy and Rosenberg, take each a portion of\r\nthis chicken, and cut it up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Heaven, Lacy, come to my relief!\" cried Rosenberg. \"The emperor is\r\nabout to give away his last morsel. We both have had breakfast, but he\r\nhas not tasted food for a day.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is right, our noble emperor,\" replied Lacy, \"in the presence of such\r\nsuffering he is right to forget himself; if he could not do so, he would\r\nnot be worthy to be a sovereign.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor heard none of this; he was already with the sufferers,\r\ndistributing his food. With earnest look, and firm and rapid hand, he\r\nput a teaspoonful of jelly between the parched, half-opened lips of the\r\ngrandmother, while Gunther, imitating him, did the same for her son.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the emperor looked to see the effect of his remedy. He saw\r\nan expression of joy flit over the features of the poor old woman, and\r\nthen her lips moved, and she swallowed the jelly.\r\n\r\n\"See, see!\" cried the emperor, overjoyed, \"she takes it. Oh, Gunther,\r\nthis will save them until help comes from Prague! But there are so many\r\nof them! Do you think we have a hundred teaspoonfuls of jelly in the\r\njar?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he looked anxiously at Gunther.\r\n\r\n\"It is a large jar, your majesty,\" said Gunther, \"and I think it will\r\nhold out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be sparing of it at any rate, and do not heap up your spoons. And now,\r\nnot another word! We must go to work.\"\r\n\r\nHe stooped down and spoke no more, but his face was lit up by the fire\r\nof the Christian charity that was consuming his noble heart. He looked\r\nas must have looked his ancestor Rudolph of Hapsburg, who, once meeting\r\na footsore priest bearing the viaticum to a dying parishioner, gave up\r\nhis horse to the servant of God, and continued his way on foot.\r\n\r\nWhile the emperor flew from group to group, resuscitating his expiring\r\nsubjects, Lacy and Rosenberg were carefully cutting up the fowl that had\r\nbeen roasted for his dinner. A deep silence reigned around, all nature\r\nseemed to be at peace, and over the reclining sufferers the evening sun\r\nthrew long rays of rosy light, that illumined their pallid faces with\r\nthe hue of hope and returning life.\r\n\r\nGradually there was motion in the scene. Here and there a head arose\r\nfrom the ground, then a body, and presently a gleam of intelligence shot\r\nathwart those glaring, bloodshot eyes. The emperor watched them with a\r\nhappy smile. His errand of mercy was at an end. The jar was empty, but\r\nevery one had received a share, and all were reviving.\r\n\r\n\"Now give them a morsel of chicken,\" said Joseph. \"A small piece will\r\nsuffice, for after their long fast they can only eat sparingly of food;\r\nand they will have had enough until help come to us from Prague.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Rosenberg, affectionately, \"I hope that your majesty, too,\r\nwill take something. There will certainly be enough left for you to eat\r\nyour dinner without remorse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind me, Rosenberg,\" laughed the emperor. \"I shall not die of\r\nstarvation, I promise you. When the creature cries out for nourishment,\r\nI shall give it; but I think that my Maker will not love me the less for\r\nhaving, voluntarily, felt the pangs of hunger for once in my life. I can\r\nnever forget this day in Bohemia; it has confirmed my resolution to\r\nreign for the good of my people alone, and as God hears me, they shall\r\nbe happy when I govern them.--But your chicken is ready. To satisfy\r\nyou, I will go and beg my supper in yonder village, and, as there are\r\nenough of you to attend to these poor sufferers, I will take Lacy to\r\nkeep me company. Come, Lacy.\"\r\n\r\nHe took the arm of the field-marshal, and both presently disappeared\r\nbehind the trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK BROTH.\r\n\r\nIn a quarter of an hour they had reached the village. The same absence\r\nof all life struck painfully upon the emperor's heart as they walked\r\nalong the deserted streets and heard nothing save the echo of their own\r\nfootsteps. Not the lowing of a cow nor the bleating of a sheep, not one\r\nfamiliar rural sound broke the mournful stillness that brooded over the\r\nair. Occasionally a ghastly figure in tattered garments, from whose\r\nvacant eyes the light of reason seemed to have fled, was seen crouching\r\nat the door of a hut, wherein his wife and children were starving. This\r\nwas the only token of life that greeted the eyes of the grave and silent\r\npair.\r\n\r\n\"Lacy,\" at last sighed the emperor, \"how fearful is this deadly silence!\r\nOne might fancy that he walked in Pompeii; and Pompeii, alas, is not\r\nmore lonely. To think that I, an emperor, must look on and give no\r\nhelp!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, sire, you can give help,\" said Lacy, encouragingly. \"There\r\nmust be some means by which this fearful famine can be arrested.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have ordered corn from Hungary, where the harvest has been abundant.\r\nTo encourage the importation of grain in Bohemia, I have promised,\r\nbesides good prices, a premium of one hundred guilders for each\r\nwell-laden, four-horse wagon of grain that arrives before the expiration\r\nof three weeks.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the people will be exhausted before three weeks.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have also ordered the commissary store-houses to be opened in Prague,\r\nand the grain to be distributed.\"\r\n\r\n\"This will last but for a few days.\" returned Lacy, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n\"Then what can I do?\" exclaimed the emperor, sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n\"The famine is so great that it can scarcely have arisen from natural\r\ncauses. Where scarcity is, there will always be found the extortioner,\r\nwho profits by it. Those who have grain are withholding it for higher\r\nprices.\"\r\n\r\n\"Woe to them, if I light upon their stores!\" exclaimed Joseph,\r\nindignantly. \"Woe to those who traffic in the fruits of the earth, which\r\nGod has bestowed for the use of all men!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty will not find them. They will be carefully hidden away\r\nfrom your sight.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will seek until I find,\" replied the emperor. \"But look there, Lacy,\r\nwhat a stately dwelling rears its proud head beyond that grove of trees!\r\nIs it the setting sun that gilds the windows just now?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty, the light is from within. I suppose it is the castle\r\nof the nobleman, who owns the village.\"\r\n\r\nThey walked a few paces farther, when the emperor spoke again. \"See,\r\nLacy, here is a hut, from whose chimney I see smoke. Perhaps I shall\r\nfind something to eat within.\"\r\n\r\nHe opened the door of the cottage, and there on the floor, in a heap,\r\nlay a woman with four children. Their hollow eyes were fixed without the\r\nslightest interest upon the strangers, for they were in the last stage\r\nof hunger-typhus, and saw nothing.\r\n\r\nLacy hurried the emperor away, saying, \"Nothing can help these except\r\ndeath. I know this terrible fever. I saw it in Moravia in '62.\"\r\n\r\nThey stepped from the cottage to the kitchen. A fire was burning in the\r\nchimney, and before it stood a man who was stirring the contents of a\r\npot.\r\n\r\n\"God be praised!\" exclaimed the emperor, \"here is food.\"\r\n\r\nThe man turned and showed a sunken, famished countenance.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want supper?\" said he roughly. \"I have a mess in my pot that an\r\nemperor might covet.\"\r\n\r\n\"He does covet it, my friend,\" said the emperor, laughing. \"What have\r\nyou there?\"\r\n\r\nThe man threw sinister glances at the well-dressed strangers, who jarred\r\nthe funeral air of his cottage with untimely mirth.\r\n\r\n\"Did you come here to mock me?\" said he. \"Fine folks, like you, are\r\nafter no good in a poor man's cottage. If you come here to pasture upon\r\nour misery, go into the house, and there you will see a sight that will\r\nrejoice the rich man's heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my friend,\" replied the emperor, soothingly, \"we come to ask for a\r\nshare of your supper.\"\r\n\r\nThe man broke out into a sardonic laugh. \"My supper!\" cried he. \"Come,\r\nthen, and see it. It is earth and water!\"\r\n\r\n\"Earth and water!\" cried the horror-stricken Joseph.\r\n\r\nThe peasant nodded. \"Yes,\" said he, \"the earth gives growth to the corn,\r\nand as I have got no corn, I am trying to see what it will do for me! I\r\nhave already tasted grass. It is so green and fresh, and seems so sweet\r\nto our cattle, that we tried to eat the SWEET GREEN GRASS.\" And he\r\nsmiled, but it was the smile of a demon.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my God!\" cried the emperor.\r\n\r\n\"But it seems,\" continued the man, as though speaking to himself, \"that\r\nGod loves cattle better than he does men; for the grass which\r\nstrengthens them, made us so sick, so sick, that it would have been a\r\nmercy if we had all died. It seems that we cannot die, however, so now I\r\nam going to eat the glorious earth. Hurrah! My supper is ready.\"\r\n\r\nHe swung the kettle upon the table and poured the black mass into a\r\nplatter.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said he, with a fiendish grin, \"now will the great folks like to\r\nsup with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the emperor, gravely, \"I will taste of your supper.\"\r\n\r\nHe stepped to the table, and took the spoon which the bewildered peasant\r\nheld out to him. Pale with excitement, the emperor put the spoon to his\r\nmouth, and tasted. Then he reached it to Lacy.\r\n\r\n\"Taste it, Lacy\" said he. \"Oh, to think that these are men who suffer\r\nthe pangs of starvation!\" And completely overcome by his sorrowing\r\nsympathy, the emperor's eyes overflowed with tears.\r\n\r\nThe peasant saw them and said, \"Yes, my lord, we are men, but God has\r\nforsaken us. He has been more merciful to the cattle, for they have all\r\ndied.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how came this fearful famine among you?\" asked Lacy. \"Did you not\r\nplant corn?\"\r\n\r\n\"How could we plant corn when we had none? For two years our crops have\r\nfailed, and hunger has eaten our vitals until there is not a man in the\r\nvillage who has the strength to raise a fagot.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I saw a castle as we came thither,\" said Lacy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you saw the castle of the Baron von Weifach. The whole country\r\nbelongs to him; but we are free peasants. As long as we made any thing,\r\nwe paid him our tithes. But we have nothing now.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with a groan he sank down upon the wooden settle that stood behind\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"The baron does nothing for you, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should he?\" said the man, with a bitter laugh. \"We pay no more\r\ntithes, and we are of no use to him. He prays every day for the famine\r\nto last, and God hears his prayers, for God forsakes the poor and loves\r\nthe rich.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how does he profit by the famine?\" asked Lacy.\r\n\r\n\"We have been profitable laborers to him, my lord. For several years\r\npast, his corn-fields have been weighed down with golden tassels that\r\nmade the heart leap with joy at sight of their beauty. He had so much\r\nthat his barns would not hold it, and he had to put up other great\r\nbarns, thatched with straw, to shelter it. This year, it is true, he has\r\nreaped nothing, but what of that? His barns are still full to\r\noverflowing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how comes there such famine, when his barns are full of corn?\"\r\nasked the emperor, who was listening with intense interest.\r\n\r\n\"That is a question which does little honor to your head, sir,\" said the\r\npeasant, with a grating laugh. \"The famine in Bohemia is terrible\r\nprecisely because the extortioners hold back their grain and will not\r\nsell it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there is a law against the hoarding of grain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there are laws made so that the poor may be punished by them and\r\nthe rich protected,\" said the peasant, with a sinister look. \"Oh, yes,\r\nthere are laws! The rich have only to say that they have no corn, and\r\nthere the law ends.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you think that the Baron von Weifach has grain?\"\r\n\r\nThe peasant nodded. \"I know it,\" said he, \"and when the time comes, he\r\nwill put it in the market.\"\r\n\r\n\"What time?\"\r\n\r\n\"When the need of the people will be so great that they will part with\r\ntheir last acre of land or last handful of gold for a few bushels of\r\ngrain. Several years ago, when corn was cheap, he sent his corn abroad\r\nto a country where the harvest had been short; but he will not do so\r\nthis year, for the rich men have speculated so well that corn is dearer\r\nhere than it is over the frontiers. [Footnote: Gross-Hoffinger, \"Life\r\nand Reign of Joseph II.,\" vol. i., p. 138. Carl Ramshorn, \"Life and\r\nTimes of Joseph II.,\" p. 99.] But I have enough of your questions. Let\r\nme alone, and go about your business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you buy food with money?\" asked the emperor, kindly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed, sir,\" said the peasant, while a ray of hope entered the\r\ndark prison of his desponding heart. \"If I had money, the housekeeper of\r\nthe baron would sell me bread, wheat, meat--oh, she would sell me any\r\nthing if I had money to pay for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take this, then,\" said the emperor, laying several gold pieces on the\r\ntable. \"I hope to bring you more permanent relief, later.\"\r\n\r\nThe peasant, with a cry, threw himself upon the gold. He paid no\r\nattention whatever to the donor. Shouting for joy at the same time that\r\nhe was shedding tears in profusion, he darted, with his prize, to his\r\nstarving wife and children, to bid them live until he brought them food.\r\n\r\nWithout, stood the emperor and Lacy. \"O God!\" murmured he to himself,\r\n\"and I have thought myself a most unhappy man! What is the grief of the\r\nheart to such bodily torture as this! Come, Lacy, come. The day of\r\nreckoning is here, and, by the eternal God, I will punish the guilty!\"\r\n\r\n\"What means your majesty?\" asked Lacy, as the emperor, instead of\r\nreturning to the village, strode forward toward the path that led to the\r\ncastle.\r\n\r\n\"I mean to go at once to yonder castle,\" cried lie, with a threatening\r\ngesture, \"and my hand shall fall heavily upon the extortioner who\r\nwithholds his grain from the people.\"\r\n\r\n\"But your majesty,\" urged Lacy, \"the word of one discontented peasant is\r\nnot enough to convict a man. You must have proofs before you condemn\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, Lacy, you are right. I must seek for proofs.\"\r\n\r\n\"How, your majesty?\"\r\n\r\n\"By going to the castle. My plan is already laid. As they seem to be\r\nfeasting to-day, I am likely to find a goodly assemblage of rich men\r\ntogether. I must get an invitation to the feast, and once there, if the\r\ncharge be just, I promise to furnish the proofs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty's undertaking is not a safe one. I must, therefore,\r\naccompany you,\" said Lacy.\r\n\r\n\"No, Lacy, I intend that you shall meet me there. Return to the place\r\nwhere we left Rosenberg and the others, take one of the carriages, and\r\ndrive with him to the castle. When you arrive there, ask for me, and say\r\nthat you are now ready to proceed on our journey. Gunther can remain\r\nwith the mountaineers, and if our provisions arrive from Prague, he can\r\ndispatch a courier to let us know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we ask for your majesty at the castle, sire?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not by my own name. Ask for Baron von Josephi, for by that title I\r\nshall introduce myself. Now farewell, and au revoir.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE EXTORTIONERS OF QUALITY.\r\n\r\nThe drawing-room of the Freiherr von Weifach was splendidly illuminated.\r\nHundreds of wax lights were multiplied to infinity in the spacious\r\nmirrors that lined the walls, and separated one from another the\r\nrichly-framed portraits of the freiherr's noble ancestors. In the\r\nbanquet-hall, the dinner-table was resplendent with silver and\r\ngold--with porcelain and crystal. Flowers sent out their perfume from\r\ncostliest vases of Dresden china, and rich old wines sparkled in goblets\r\nof glittering glass. Around the table sat a company of richly-dressed\r\nladies and gentlemen of rank. They had been four hours at dinner, and\r\nthe sense of enjoyment, springing from the satisfaction of appetite, was\r\nvisible, not only on the flushed faces of the men, but betrayed itself\r\nupon the rosy-tinted faces of the elegant women who were their\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nThe dessert was on the table. The guests were indulging themselves in\r\nsome of those post-prandial effusions which are apt to blossom from\r\nheads overheated by wine, and are generally richer in words than in\r\nwisdom. The host, with flattering preliminaries, had proposed the health\r\nof the ladies, and every goblet sparkled to the brim. Just at that\r\nmoment a servant entered the room and whispered a few words in his ear.\r\nHe turned, smiling to his guests and, apologizing for the interruption,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, I leave it to you to decide the question just\r\nproposed to me. A gentleman has at this moment arrived at the castle,\r\nrequesting permission to remain until some repairs can be made to his\r\ncarriage, which has met with an accident in the neighboring village.\r\nShall we invite him to join us while he awaits the return of his\r\nvehicle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us not be rash in our hospitality,\" replied the freiherrin, from\r\nthe opposite side of the table. \"In the name of the noble ladies\r\nassembled here, I crave to know whether the stranger who comes so sans\r\nfagon to our castle, is worthy of the honor proposed by my husband. In\r\nother words, is he a personage of rank?\"\r\n\r\n\"He presents himself as the Baron von Josephi,\" said the freiherr.\r\n\r\n\"One of the oldest families in Hungary!\" exclaimed one of the guests.\r\n\r\n\"Then he can be admitted,\" responded the hostess. \"At least, if it be\r\nagreeable to the ladies?\"\r\n\r\nUnanimous consent was given, and the freiherr arose from his seat to\r\nconvey the invitation to the stranger.\r\n\r\n\"The Baron von Josephi!\" said he, reentering with the gentleman, and\r\nleading him at once to the freiherrin. She received him with smiling\r\ncourtesy, while the rest of the company directed their glances toward\r\nhim, anxious to see how he would acquit himself in his rather\r\nembarrassing position. He was perfectly self-possessed, and in every\r\ngesture showed himself to be a man of the world.\r\n\r\nWith quiet grace he took his seat at the side of the hostess, and,\r\nas he looked around with his large blue eyes, he seemed rather to be\r\ncriticising than criticised. With a sharp, searching expression, his\r\nglances went from one of the company to another, until they in their\r\nturn felt not only embarrassed, but harassed and uneasy.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know why,\" whispered one of them to the lady who sat next to\r\nhim, \"but this newcomer's face seems very familiar to me. I must have\r\nmet him somewhere before this.\"\r\n\r\n\"You certainly might remember him,\" replied the lady, \"if it were only\r\nfor his beautiful eyes. I never saw such eyes in my life. His manners,\r\ntoo, are distinguished. I judge that he must have lived at court.\"\r\n\r\n\"In other words, you prefer a man who fawns at court to one who reigns\r\nlike a prince over his own estates,\" said the first speaker, warmly.\r\n\"I, for my part--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush! Let us hear what he is saying,\" interrupted the lady.\r\n\r\n\"I am under many obligations for your hospitality,\" said the Baron von\r\nJosephi to the hostess. \"For three days that I have travelled in\r\nBohemia, I have met with nothing but poverty and starvation. Thanks to\r\nmy entrance into your splendid home, I see that plenty still reigns in\r\nthe castle, although it may have departed from the cottage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, thank Heaven, we know how to take care of our own interests here,\"\r\nsaid the freiherr, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"And yet you see how things are exaggerated,\" replied the Baron von\r\nJosephi, laughing. \"Such dreadful tidings of the famine in Bohemia\r\nreached Vienna that the emperor is actually on his way to investigate\r\nthe matter. I met him not far from Budweis, and he seemed very sad I\r\nthought.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the saints, he has reason to feel sad,\" exclaimed one of the guests.\r\n\"He will find nothing here for his howling subjects. He would have been\r\nwiser had he stayed in Vienna!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, poor, sentimental little emperor!\" cried another with a laugh. \"He\r\nwill find that the stamp of his imperial foot will conjure no corn out\r\nof the earth, wherewith to feed his starving boors.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not see why he should meddle with the boors at all,\" added a\r\nthird. \"Hungry serfs are easy to govern; they have no time to cry for\r\nrights when they are crying for bread.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the gentlemen are going to talk of politics,\" said the hostess,\r\nrising from her seat, \"it is time for ladies to retire. Come, ladies,\r\nour cavaliers will join us when coffee is served.\"\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen rose, and not until the last lady had passed from the room\r\ndid they resume their seats.\r\n\r\n\"And now, gentlemen,\" said Baron von Josephi, \"as our political gossip\r\ncan no longer annoy the ladies, allow me to say that my presence here is\r\nnot accidental, as I had led you to suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to what are we indebted for the honor?\" asked the host.\r\n\r\n\"I will explain,\" said the baron, inclining his head. \"You have received\r\nme with the hospitality of the olden time, without inquiring my rank,\r\nlineage, or dwelling-place. Permit me to introduce myself. I have\r\nestates in Moravia, and they are contiguous to those of Count Hoditz.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" replied Freiherr von Weifach, \"I sympathize with you, for\r\nnowhere in Austria has the famine been more severe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Severe, indeed! The poor are dying like flies, for they cannot learn to\r\nlive upon grass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither will they learn to live upon it in Bohemia,\" said the freiherr,\r\nlaughing. \"The people are so unreasonable! The noblest race-horse lives\r\nupon hay and grass; why should it not be good enough for a peasant of\r\nlow degree?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mere prejudice on the part of the peasant!\" returned the baron. \"I have\r\nalways suspected him of affectation. I have no patience with grumblers.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, baron,\" said his neighbor, nodding and smiling. \"The\r\npeople are idle and wasteful; and if we were to listen to their\r\ncomplaints, we would soon be as poor as they.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what if a few thousand perish here and there?\" interposed another.\r\n\"They never would be missed, for they multiply like potatoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say, baron,\" resumed the host, \"that you paid no attention to the\r\ncomplaints of your peasantry?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did like Ulysses, gentlemen; I stopped my ears with wax, that my\r\nheart might not grow weak.\"\r\n\r\n\"A melodious siren song, to be sure,\" laughed the company; \"a dirge of\r\nbread! bread! bread!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you know the song, I perceive,\" said the Baron von Josephi, joining\r\nin the laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and we do as you have done, baron. We stop our ears.\"\r\n\r\n\"The consequence is,\" continued Josephi, \"that my granaries are full to\r\noverflowing. I was on my way to Prague to dispose of it, but the want\r\nwhich I have seen on your estates, freiherr, has touched my heart.\r\nNowhere have I beheld any thing to equal it. Hundreds of starving\r\npeasants are on the high-road, not a mile off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you honor us with your presence to tell me this?\" asked the host,\r\nwith lowering brow. \"If so, you might have spared your trouble, for I\r\nknow it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no; I came to you with the best intentions. I have no pity for the\r\npeasant, but some for yourself. The health of his workmen is the\r\nnobleman's wealth. Now my own people are almost all dead, and as I\r\ngrieve to see your lands wasted, I offer you my corn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which means that you wish me to buy it,\" said the freiherr, with a\r\nsignificant smile.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and you can have it at once. I know that I might do better by\r\nwaiting, but I have a tender heart, and am willing to part with it now.\r\nI make you the offer.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much a strich?\" [Footnote: A strich, in Prague, was something more\r\nthan two bushels.] asked the freiherr.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty florins. You will find it cheap.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very cheap, forsooth!\" cried the host, with a loud laugh, in which his\r\nguests all joined. \"You wish me to buy your corn for my peasants? Why,\r\nit will be worth its weight in gold, and they have none wherewith to pay\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a humane landlord and a nobleman; and I take it for granted\r\nthat you will make it a gift to your peasantry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you not do as much yourself?\" asked the freiherr, scornfully.\r\n\"Have you not just now said that your people were dying, while your\r\ngranaries are full? No, no; I want no corn; but when corn has truly\r\nrisen to twenty florins, then I shall open my granaries, and my crops\r\nshall be for sale.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the freiherr filled his glass and drank a bumper.\r\n\r\n\"You should not speak so loud,\" said Josephi \"for you know that the\r\nemperor has issued an edict, exacting that all those who have grain\r\nshall meet him in Prague, that the government may buy their grain at a\r\nreasonable price.\"\r\n\r\n\"What fool would heed such an edict?\" cried the freiherr. \"The emperor\r\nis not master of our granaries. In the rural districts the nobleman is\r\nemperor, and God forbid that it should ever be otherwise!\"\r\n\r\n\"But the emperor has appointed commissioners, who go from place to\r\nplace, and inspect the crops.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes they came hither, and they came to all of us--did they not, my\r\nlords?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes!\" cried a chorus of merry noblemen.\r\n\r\n\"But they found nothing--nothing but a few hundred florins that glided,\r\nunaccountably, into their hands, and caused them to abscond in a hurry.\r\nThis people-loving emperor deserves the eternal gratitude of his\r\ncommissioners, for although they found no corn for him, they found an\r\nabundance of gold for themselves.\"\r\n\r\nJosephi colored violently, and his whole frame trembled. His hand\r\nclutched the wine-glass which he held, and he seemed to breathe with\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nNo one observed it. The company were excited by wine, and their senses\r\nwere dim and clouded. But for this sumptuous dinner, at which he had\r\nindulged himself too far, the freiherr would never have betrayed the\r\nsecret of his overflowing barns.\r\n\r\nJosephi, meanwhile, controlled his indignation, and spoke again. \"So,\r\nfreiherr, you all reject my proposal.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do. God be praised, I have enough and to spare!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, gentlemen.\" continued the baron, \"I offer it to any one of you.\r\nYou are all from this unhappy district, and some one of you must be in\r\nneed of grain.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are the freiherr's neighbors, and have borrowed his wisdom,\" said\r\none of the company, \"and I can answer for all present that they are well\r\nprovided.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are seven of you present, and none needing grain!\" exclaimed Von\r\nJosephi.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Seven noblemen, all abounding in grain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seven extortioners!\" cried Josephi, rising from his seat, and looking\r\nas if he would have stricken them to the earth with the lightning of his\r\nflashing eyes.\r\n\r\n\"What means this insolence?\" asked the host.\r\n\r\n\"It means that I have found here seven men of noble birth, who have\r\ndisgraced their caste by fattening upon the misery of their fellows. But\r\nby the eternal God! the extortioner shall be branded throughout the\r\nworld. And be he gentle or base-born, he shall feel the weight of my\r\njust indignation.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the emperor spoke, the company had been awaking from the stupor\r\ncaused by the wine they had been drinking. Gradually their heads were\r\nraised to listen, and their eyes shot fire, until, at last, they sprang\r\nfrom their seats, crying out:\r\n\r\n\"Who dares speak thus to us? By what right do you come to insult us?\"\r\n\r\n\"By what right?\" thundered the emperor. \"The emperor has given me the\r\nright--the little chicken-hearted emperor, whose commissioners you have\r\nbribed, and whose subjects you have oppressed, until nothing remains for\r\nhim but to come among you and drag your infamy to daylight with his own\r\nhands.\"\r\n\r\n\"The emperor! it is the emperor!\" groaned the terror-stricken\r\nextortioners, while Joseph looked contemptuously upon their pale and\r\nconscience-stricken faces.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the host burst into a maudlin laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Do you not see,\" said he, \"that our facetious guest is making game of\r\nus to revenge himself for our refusal to buy his corn?\"\r\n\r\n\"True, true,\" cried the lords together. \"It's a jest--a trick to--\"\r\n\r\n\"Peace!\" cried the emperor. \"The hour for jesting has passed by, and the\r\nhour of retribution is here. I came to Bohemia to feed my starving\r\nsubjects, and I will feed them! But I shall also punish those who,\r\nhaving bread, have withheld it from the poor. You shall not bribe ME\r\nwith your parchments of nobility or with your pride of family. The\r\npillory is for the criminal, and his rank shall not save him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercy, gracious sovereign, mercy!\" cried the freiherr, whose glowing\r\ncheeks were now as pale as death. \"Your majesty will not condemn us for\r\nthe idle words we have spoken from excesss of wine?\"\r\n\r\n\"What mercy had you upon the wailing wretches, of whose misery you have\r\nmade such sport to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty,\" said one of the noblemen, sullenly, \"there is no law to\r\nprevent a man from holding his own, and the Bohemian nobleman has his\r\nown code of justice, and is amenable to no other.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Bohemian nobleman shall enjoy it no longer!\" exclaimed the outraged\r\nemperor. \"Before their earthly judges men shall be equal, as they are\r\nbefore the throne of God.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment the door opened, and the emperor's suite came in. \"Lacy,\r\nLacy!\" cried Joseph, \"you were right. The famine is not the result of a\r\nshort harvest. It is due to these monsters of wickedness, whom you see\r\nbefore you in the enjoyment of every luxury that sensuality can crave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercy, sire, mercy!\" cried a chorus of imploring voices, and looking\r\nbehind him, the emperor saw the ladies, who all sank upon their knees at\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\nWhile Joseph had been speaking with Lacy, the lord of the castle had\r\nhastened to communicate their disgrace, and to bring the wives of the\r\ncriminals to their assistance.\r\n\r\nThe emperor frowned. \"Ladies,\" said he, \"we are on the subject of\r\npolitics, the same subject which banished you hence not long ago. Rise,\r\ntherefore, and retire--this is no place for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sire,\" cried the Freiherrin von Weifach, \"I will not rise until I\r\nobtain pardon for my husband. I do not know of what he has been guilty,\r\nbut I know that our noble emperor cannot condemn the man under whose\r\nroof he has come as an invited guest. I know that the emperor is too\r\ngenerous to punish him, who, confiding in him as a man, little suspected\r\nthat he who came under a borrowed name was the sovereign lord of all\r\nAustria.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, madame, you reproach me with an hour spent at your table, and you\r\nexpect me to overlook crime in consideration of the common courtesy\r\nextended to me as a man of your own rank. I was so fortunate as to\r\noverhear the little discussion that preceded my entrance here. Rise,\r\nmadame, I am not fond of Spanish customs, nor do I like to see women on\r\ntheir knees.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercy for my husband!\" reiterated the freiherrin. \"Forgive him for\r\nthinking more of his own family than of others. What he did was for love\r\nof his wife and children.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed the emperor, \"you call that love of his family! You\r\nwould elevate his cruel avarice into a domestic virtue. I congratulate\r\nyou upon your high standard of ethics! But rise, I command you.\r\nMeanwhile, you are right on one point at least. I have eaten of your\r\nsalt, and I am too true a nobleman to betray you to the emperor. I will\r\nmerely tell him that the corn is found, and that his poor people may\r\nrejoice. Open your granaries, therefore, my lords. Let each of you this\r\nnight send a courier to your tenants, proffering grain to all, free of\r\ncharge stipulating only that, as a return for the gift, the peasantry\r\nshall bestow a portion of their corn upon their mother earth. [Footnote:\r\nGross-Hoffinger, vol. i., p. 141.] You will see how magical is the\r\neffect of generosity. Your stores will scatter blessings over this\r\nunhappy land, and the poor will bless you as their benefactors. Yes,\r\ngentlemen, from this day forward you will be the friends of the needy;\r\nfor, God be praised, you have corn, and, for the sake of your corn, I\r\nforgive you. But see that the future makes full atonement for the past.\"\r\n\r\nNo one answered a word. With sullen mien and downcast eyes they stood,\r\nwhile the emperor surveyed them with surprise.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said he, after a long and painful pause, \"not a word of thanks!\r\nJoy has made you dumb, I perceive. And no wonder; for to feel (for the\r\nfirst time) the pleasures of benevolence may well make you speechless\r\nwith happiness. As for you, madame,\" continued the emperor, addressing\r\nhis hostess, \"I will not deprive you of a share in your husband's\r\ngenerosity. You will be so kind as to call up your servants and bid them\r\nload a wagon with the remains of our excellent dinner, not forgetting\r\nthe wines; and you will then send it, with your greetings, to your\r\ntenants in yonder village. Your servants can go from house to house\r\nuntil the store is exhausted.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do what your majesty commands,\" said the freiherrin, pale with\r\nrage.\r\n\r\n\"I do not doubt it,\" replied the emperor, laughing. \"And as I will be\r\nglad to hear how your bounty is received in the village, two of my own\r\nattendants will accompany yours. Farewell, my lords, I must leave you,\r\nfor I have a large company on the high-road whom I have invited to\r\nsupper. The freiherrin will oblige me by receiving them to-night as her\r\nguests. In this stately castle there are, doubtless, several rooms that\r\ncan be thrown open to these weary, suffering mountaineers. Have I your\r\npermission to send them hither?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will obey your majesty's commands,\" sobbed the lady, no longer able\r\nto control her tears.\r\n\r\nThe emperor bowed, and turning to his attendants, said, \"Come, my\r\nfriends, our messengers have probably arrived before this, and our\r\nguests await us.\"\r\n\r\nHe advanced to the door, but suddenly stopped and addressed the company.\r\n\"My lords,\" said he, \"for once your wisdom has been at fault. It is well\r\nthat the sentimental little emperor did not remain, as you advised, in\r\nVienna; for the stamp of his imperial foot has struck abundance out of\r\nthe earth, and it will save the lives of his starving boors.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXV.\r\n\r\nDIPLOMATIC ESOTERICS.\r\n\r\nPrince Kaunitz was in his cabinet. Baron Binder was reading aloud the\r\nsecret dispatches which had just come in from the Austrian ambassador at\r\nBerlin, the young Baron van Swieten. Meanwhile, Kaunitz was busy with a\r\nbrush of peacock's feathers, dusting the expensive trifles that covered\r\nhis escritoire, or polishing its ebony surface with a fine silk\r\nhandkerchief which he kept for the purpose. This furbishing of trinkets\r\nand furniture was a private pastime with the all-powerful minister; and\r\nmany a personage of rank was made to wait in the anteroom, while he\r\nfinished his dusting or rearranged his bijouterie, until it was grouped\r\nto his satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe dispatches which were being read were of the highest importance; for\r\nthey related to a confidential conversation with the King of Prussia on\r\nthe subject of the political apple, at which all were striving for the\r\nlargest bite. The King of Prussia, wrote the ambassador, had spoken\r\njestingly of the partition of Poland. He had bespoken for himself the\r\ndistrict of Netz and Polish Prussia, premising that Dantzic, Thorn, and\r\nCracow were to be left to Poland.\r\n\r\n\"Very well arranged,\" said Kaunitz, with his accustomed sang froid,\r\nwhile he brightened the jewels of a Sevres inkstand which had been\r\npresented to him by Madame de Pompadour. \"Vraiment the naivete of this\r\nFrederick is prodigious. He appropriates the richest and most cultivated\r\ndistricts of Poland to himself; and then inserts, as an unimportant\r\nclause, the stipulation that Cracow, with its adjacent territory, the\r\nrich salt mines of Wieliczka, shall not belong to Austria.\"\r\n\r\n\"Van Swieten would not agree to the arrangement,\" said Binder, \"and he\r\nfurthermore declared to the king that such a distribution would be\r\nprejudicial to Austria. He proposed, however, that Austria might be\r\nindemnified by the possession of Bosnia and Servia, which the Porte\r\nshould be made to yield.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a preposterous fool!\" exclaimed Kaunitz. \"Who gave him the right\r\nto make such a proposition--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, your highness, I suppose he thought--\"\r\n\r\n\"He has no right to think,\" interrupted Kaunitz. \"I ask of no employe of\r\nmine to think. My envoys have nothing to do but to work out MY thoughts,\r\nand that without any intervention of their own fancies. It is very\r\npresuming in my little diplomatic agents to think what I have not\r\nthought, and of their own accord to make propositions to foreign courts.\r\nWrite and tell him so, Binder, and add, that neither our permanent\r\npeaceful relations with Turkey, nor the sentiments of consideration\r\nwhich are entertained by the empress for the Porte, will allow of any\r\nattempt to lessen his territory.\" [Footnote: Wilhelm von Dohm, \"Memoirs\r\nof My Time,\" vol. i., 489.]\r\n\r\n\"Then you are really in earnest, and intend to be a firm ally of the\r\nPorte?\" inquired Binder with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"In earnest!\" repeated Kaunitz, with a shrug. \"You statesman in\r\nswaddling-clothes! You do not know the first principles of your\r\nprofession; and yet you have lived with me for thirty years! In\r\ndiplomacy there is no such thing as stability of policy. Policy shapes\r\nitself according to circumstances, and changes as they change. The man\r\nwho attempted to follow fixed principles in international policy, would\r\nsoon find himself and his government on the verge of a precipice.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet there is no statesman in Europe who adheres so closely to his\r\nprinciples as yourself,\" exclaimed Binder, with the enthusiasm of true\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\nKaunitz majestically inclined his head. \"My principles are these: To\r\nmake Austria rich, great, powerful. Austria shall be quoeungue modo, the\r\nfirst power in Europe; and in after-years the world shall say that the\r\ngenius of Kaunitz placed her on the mountain-peaks of her greatness. For\r\nthis end, it is indispensable that I remain at the head of European\r\naffairs. Not only Austria, but all Europe, looks to me to guide her\r\nthrough the storm that is threatening the general peace. I dare not\r\nleave the helm of state to take one hour's rest; for what would become\r\nof the great continental ship if, seeking my own comfort, I were to\r\nretire and yield her fortunes to some unsteady hand? There is no one to\r\nreplace me! No one! It is only once in a century that Heaven vouchsafes\r\na great statesman to the world. This makes me fear for Austria when I\r\nshall have gone from earth and there is no one to succeed me.\"\r\n[Footnote: The prince's own words. See Swinburne, vol. i., p. 230.]\r\n\r\n\"May you live many years to rule in Austria!\" cried Binder, warmly; \"you\r\nare indispensable to her welfare.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it,\" said Kaunitz, gravely. \"But there are aspirants for\r\npolitical fame in Austria, who would like to lay their awkward hands\r\nupon the web that I weave? No one knows how far the youthful impetuosity\r\nand boundless vanity of such ambition may go. It might lead its\r\npossessor to entertain the insane idea that he could govern Austria\r\nwithout my guidance.\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak of the Emperor Joseph?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do. He is ambitious, overbearing, and vain. He mistakes his\r\nstupid longings to do good for capacity. He lusts for fame through war\r\nand conquest, and would change every thing in his mother's empire, for\r\nthe mere satisfaction of knowing that the change was his own work. Oh,\r\nwhat would become of Austria if I were not by, to keep him within\r\nbounds? It will task all my genius to steer between the Scylla of a\r\nbigoted, peace-loving empress, and the Charybdis of this reckless\r\nemperor; to reconcile their antagonisms, and overrule their prejudices.\r\nMaria Theresa is for peace and a treaty with the Porte, who has lately\r\nbeen a good-natured, harmless neighbor--Joseph thirsts for war that he\r\nmay enlarge his dominions and parade himself before the world as a\r\nmilitary genius. If his mother were to die to-morrow, he would plunge\r\nheadlong into a war with Russia or Turkey, whichever one he might happen\r\nto fancy. I am obliged to hold this prospect forever before his eyes to\r\nkeep him quiet. I must also pay my tribute to the whims of the reigning\r\nempress; and if we declare war to pacify Joseph, we must also make it\r\nappear to Maria Theresa that war is inevitable.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Heaven, that is a delicate web, indeed!\" cried Binder, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and let no presuming hand ever touch a thread of it!\" replied\r\nKaunitz. \"I say as much as I have said to you, Binder, because the\r\ngreatest minds must sometimes find a vent for their conceptions, and I\r\ntrust nobody on earth except you. Now you know what I mean by 'permanent\r\ntreaties with the Porte,' and I hope you will not ask any more silly\r\nquestions. You ignoramus! that have lived so long with Kaunitz and have\r\nnot yet learned to know him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your highness is beyond the comprehension of ordinary men,\" said\r\nBinder, with a good-humored smile.\r\n\r\n\"I believe so,\" replied Kaunitz, with truthful simplicity; while he\r\ncarefully placed his paper, pens, lines, and penknife in the drawer\r\nwherein they belonged.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and a servant announced his excellency Osman Pacha,\r\nambassador of the Ottoman Porte.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" replied Kaunitz with a nod, \"I will see him presently.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said he to Binder, as the door closed upon the servant, \"we\r\nare about to begin in earnest with the Porte. I shall receive him in the\r\ndrawing-room. Meanwhile, remain here, for I shall need you again.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled kindly upon his friend, and left the room. Binder looked after\r\nhim with tenderest admiration. \"He is a very great man,\" said he to\r\nhimself, \"and he is right. But for him, Austria would fall to the rank\r\nof a second power. What if he does know it and boast of it? He is a\r\ntruthful and candid man. Voild tout.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he sat down to write to Van Swieten in Berlin to beware of saying\r\nany thing prejudicial to the interests of the Porte.\r\n\r\nHe had just concluded his letter when Kaunitz returned. His countenance\r\nwas beaming with satisfaction and his lips were half parting with a\r\nsmile. \"Binder,\" said he, laying a roll of papers on the escritoire,\r\n\"here are sugar-plums for the emperor. Can you guess what I have in\r\nthese papers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a declaration of war from Russia!\" exclaimed Binder.\r\n\r\n\"Hm; something very like it, I assure you. Listen! It is the secret\r\ntreaty that our minister at Constantinople, Herr von Thugut, has just\r\nconcluded with the Porte. The Sultan has already signed it, and to-day I\r\nshall present it for signature to the empress. She will do it readily;\r\nfor although she may not absolutely dote on the infidel, she hates\r\nRussia; and the unbelieving Turk is dearer to her than her Christian\r\ncousin, the Empress Catharine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, after all, we are the firm allies of Turkey?\" said Binder.\r\n\r\nThe prince gave a shrug, and trifled with the papers he had brought with\r\nhim. \"We have bound ourselves,\" said he, reading here and there among\r\nthe leaves, \"to bring about a peace between Russia and Turkey, by which\r\nthe former shall restore to the latter all the provinces which she has\r\nconquered from the Porte; or, if not all, those which are indispensable\r\nto preserve the honor of Turkey intact. We have furthermore bound\r\nourselves to secure the independence of the Republic of Poland.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, prince, that contradicts all your previous understandings with\r\nPrussia and Russia; it contradicts your plans for the partition of\r\nPoland. It will certainly lead to war, for our highness has forgotten\r\nthat Prussia and Russia have already agreed, for the soi disant\r\npacification of Poland, to appropriate the greater part of her provinces\r\nto themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg you to believe, my verdant friend, that I never forget any\r\nthing,\" said Kaunitz, somewhat haughtily. \"I am perfectly au fait to the\r\nRusso-Prussian treaty; but I have not been invited to the banquet, and I\r\ndo not intend to go uninvited. When they speak, we will consider their\r\noffers. If they say nothing, we go to war. If they speak, we will allow\r\nourselves to be persuaded to share the booty which we cannot restore to\r\nits owners. In that way, we are in a manner forced into this coalition,\r\nand the opprobrium of the act falls upon those who devised it, while\r\nMaria Theresa's scruples will be more easily overcome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prince,\" said Binder, with a sigh, \"I give it up. I never will make a\r\nstatesman. I listen to your words as to a Delphic oracle, and do not\r\npretend to understand their ambiguous meaning. I understand, however, do\r\nI not, that we are the allies of the Sultan? Now we thereby do him a\r\ngreat favor--what does he give in return?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much, but still something,\" said Kaunitz, with composure, while his\r\nfingers again turned over the leaves. \"The Porte, who, like yourself,\r\napprehends war with Russia, understands that if Austria is to befriend\r\nhim, she must put her army upon a war footing. If Austria is to do this\r\nfor the sake of Turkey, Turkey of course must furnish the means. The\r\nPorte then, in the course of the next eight months, will pay us the sum\r\nof twenty thousand purses, each containing five hundred silver piasters.\r\nFour thousand purses will be paid down as soon as the treaty is signed.\"\r\n[Footnote: Dohm, \"Memoirs of My Time,\" vol. i., p. 471.]\r\n\r\n\"Ten millions of piasters!\" exclaimed Binder, with uplifted hands. \"By\r\nHeaven, prince, you are a second Moses. You know how to strike a rock so\r\nthat a silver fountain shall gush from its barrenness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall make good use of it, too. Our coffers need replenishing, and\r\nthe emperor will rejoice to see them filled with the gold of the\r\ninfidel. It will enable him to raise and equip a gallant army, and that\r\nwill give him such unbounded delight that we are sure of his signature.\r\nBesides this, the Porte presents us with a goodly portion of Wallachia;\r\nhe fixes the boundaries of Transylvania to our complete satisfaction,\r\nand allows us free trade with the Ottoman empire, both by land and by\r\nwater.\"\r\n\r\n\"But all these concessions will cost us a war with Russia. The rapacious\r\nCzarina will be furious when she hears of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"She will not hear of them,\" said Kaunitz, quietly. \"I have made it a\r\nstringent condition with Osman Pacha that the treaty with Turkey shall\r\nbe a profound secret. The Sultan and his vizier have pledged their word,\r\nand the Mussulman may always be trusted. We will only make the treaty\r\npublic in case of a war with Russia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whence it follows that as Russia is much more likely to court our\r\nfriendship than our enmity, the treaty with the Porte is all moonshine.\"\r\n\r\n\"With the exception of the ten millions of piasters, which are terrene\r\nand tangible. It remains now to see whether Turkey will keep silence or\r\nRussia will speak! In either case, the peace of all Europe now lies in\r\nAustria's hands. We will preserve or destroy it as is most advantageous\r\nto our own interests.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment the door leading to the anteroom was opened, and a page\r\nannounced Prince Gallitzin, ambassador of her majesty the Empress of\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nThis announcement following the subjects which had been under\r\ndiscussion, was so significant, that Kaunitz could not conceal his sense\r\nof its supreme importance. He was slightly disturbed; but recovering\r\nhimself almost instantaneously, he said:\r\n\r\n\"In five minutes I will receive his highness in this room. Now begone,\r\nand open the door punctually.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can the Russian minister want to-day?\" said Binder.\r\n\r\n\"He has come to speak at last,\" replied Kaunitz, taking breath.\r\n\r\n\"Not of the partition of Poland, but of your Turkish treaty. You will\r\nsee that he if he gain any thing by talking, the Porte will not keep\r\nsilence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Three minutes gone,\" said Kaunitz, taking out his watch.\r\n\r\n\"Not another word, Binder. Step behind that screen and listen to our\r\ndiscussion. It will save me the trouble of repeating it to you.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Binder was concealing himself, Kaunitz was composing his visage\r\nbefore a looking-glass. It soon reached its accustomed serenity, and not\r\na lock of the peruke was out of place.\r\n\r\nIn five minutes the page reopened the door and announced the entrance of\r\nthe Russian ambassador.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVI.\r\n\r\nRUSSIA SPEAKS.\r\n\r\nPrince Kaunitz stood in the centre of the room when the Russian minister\r\nmade his appearance. He raised his cold blue eyes with perfect\r\nindifference to the smiling face of the Russian, who bowed low, while\r\nhis host vouchsafed him a slight inclination of the head. Prince\r\nGallitzin seemed to be as unconscious of this haughty reception as of\r\nthe fact that Kaunitz had not moved forward a singe step to greet him.\r\nHe traversed with unruffled courtesy the distance that separated him\r\nfrom Austria, and offered his hand with the grace of a finished\r\ncourtier.\r\n\r\nKaunitz raised his languidly, and allowed it to rest for a moment in the\r\npalm of his cordial visitor.\r\n\r\n\"See, what a propitious incident,\" said Prince Gallitzin; \"Austria and\r\nRussia have given each other the hand. \"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your highness,\" replied Kaunitz gravely, \"Russia has offered\r\nher hand, and Austria takes it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But without returning my cordial pressure,\" said the Russian.\r\n\r\nPrince Kaunitz appeared not to hear this affectionate reproach. He\r\npointed to the arm-chairs on either side of the escritoire, saying, \"Let\r\nus be seated.\"\r\n\r\nPrince Gallitzin waited until Kaunitz had taken his seat, which he did\r\nin a most deliberate manner, then he took the chair opposite. \"Your\r\nhighness has been so good as to look over the new proposals for peace\r\nwhich Russia has offered to Turkey?\" asked Prince Gallitzin.\r\n\r\n\"I have read them,\" replied Raunitz, curtly.\r\n\r\n\"Your highness will then have remarked that, accommodating herself to\r\nthe wishes of Austria, Russia has retained only such of her conditions\r\nas were necessary to the preservation of her dignity before the world.\r\nBut my imperial mistress has instructed me to say explicitly that her\r\nmoderation toward Turkey is exclusively the fruit of her consideration\r\nfor Austria. But for this consideration, Turkey would have felt the full\r\nweight of the empress's vengeance; and it might have come to pass that\r\nthis Porte, who already totters with his own weakness, would have been\r\nprecipitated by Russia far into the depths of the Black Sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case Russia would have learned that Austra is a diver that\r\nknows how to fish for pearls. We would have rescued the Porte from the\r\nBlack Sea, and if he had not been strong enough to sustain himself, we\r\nwould have exacted a tonic at your hands in the form of more\r\nadvantageous conditions of peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then our conditions are not satisfactory?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are of such a nature that Austria cannot entertain them for a\r\nmoment. Turkey can never consent to the independence of the Crimea and\r\nWallachia, nor will Austria counsel her to such an indiscreet\r\nconcession. This would be so contrary to the interests of Austria that\r\nwe would oppose it, even should Turkey be forced by untoward\r\ncircumstances to yield the point.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" cried Gallitzin, laughing, \"Austria would find herself in the\r\nsingular position of a nation warring with another to force that nation\r\nto take care of its own interests. Will your highness then tell me, what\r\nare the conditions which Austria is willing to accept for Turkey?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are these: that the right of the Sultan to appoint the Khan of the\r\nCrimea and the Hospodar of Wallachia remain untouched. If Russia will\r\nrecognize the sovereignty of the Porte in that quarter, then Austria\r\nwill induce him to withdraw his pretensions in Tartary.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to leave to Russia the territory she has conquered there?\" asked\r\nGallitzin with his ineffable smile. \"The czarina has no desire to\r\nenlarge her vast empire. Russia does not war in the Crimea for herself,\r\nbut for a noble race of men who feel rich and powerful enough to elect\r\ntheir own rulers. Her struggle in Tartary is simply that of civilization\r\nand freedom against barbarism and tyranny.\"\r\n\r\n\"How beautiful all this sounds in the mouth of a Russian!\" said Kaunitz,\r\nsmiling. \"You will acknowledge that Russia is not always consistent; for\r\ninstance--in Poland, where she does not perceive the right of a noble\r\nrace of men to elect their own rulers, but forces upon them a king whom\r\nthey all despise. I must now declare to you that my sovereign will enter\r\ninto negotiations with Turkey on one condition only: that the\r\nterritorial rights of Poland be left untouched, not only by Russia, but\r\nby any other European power!\" [Footnote: V. Dohm. \"Memoirs\" vol. i., p.\r\n492.]\r\n\r\nPrince Gallitzin stared at Kaunitz as he heard these astounding words;\r\nbut the Austrian met his gaze with perfect unconcern.\r\n\r\n\"Your highness defends the integrity of Polish territory,\" said\r\nGallitzin, after a short pause, \"and yet you have been the first to\r\ninvade it. Is not the Zips a portion of the kingdom of Poland?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your highness, no. The Zips was originally a Hungarian dependency,\r\nand was mortgaged to Poland. We intend to resume our property and pay\r\nthe mortgage in the usual way. This is not at all to the point. We speak\r\nof the fate of Poland. As for Austria, she aims at nothing but her\r\nrights; and as soon as the Empress of Russia withdraws her troops from\r\nPolish ground, we will withdraw ours, as well as all pretensions\r\nwhatever to the smallest portion of Polish territory.\"\r\n\r\n\"And doubtless your highness intends to restore every thing for which\r\nthe Poles are now contending. Her ancient constitution, for instance;\r\nthat constitution which has been thrown upon the political system of\r\nEurope like the apple of Eris, threatening discord and conflict without\r\nend.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Kaunitz, quickly, \"their constitution must be modified as the\r\ninterests of their neighbors may require. We must unite on some\r\nmodifications that are suitable to us, and if Poland refuse to accept\r\nthere, she must be forced to do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" cried Gallitzin, much relieved, \"if your highness is of this mind\r\nwe will soon understand one another; and I may, therefore, be permitted\r\nto speak with perfect frankness on the part of Russia.\"\r\n\r\n\"At last!\" exclaimed Kaunitz, taking a long breath. \"Russia will speak\r\nat last! So far she has only acted; and I confess that her actions have\r\nbeen inexplicable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Russia keeps pace with Austria,\" said Gallitzin. \"The court of Vienna\r\nsays that the integrity of Poland must be respected; nevertheless she is\r\nthe first to lay her hand upon it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some things we dare not do because they seem too difficult, others only\r\nseem to be difficult because we dare not do them. We have taken our\r\nslice of Poland because it belonged to us, and the difficulty of the\r\nstep has not deterred us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, your highness, as regards your right to the Zips, there is not a\r\nkingdom in Europe that has not some old forgotten right to her\r\nneighbor's territory! Russia and--Prussia, too, have similar claims on\r\nPoland, so that if it be agreeable to the empress-queen and to--your\r\nhighness we will meet together to have an understanding on the subject.\r\nSome little time may be required to define our several claims, but this\r\nonce settled, there will be no further difficulty in the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said Kaunitz, with a satisfied air, \"that we already understand\r\none another. As Russia has spoken and has made proposals, Austria is\r\nready to respond. But before we attend to our own affairs, let us give\r\npeace to Turkey. The court of Vienna will negotiate between you. Let me\r\nadvise you to be exorbitant in your demands; go somewhat beyond your\r\nreal intentions, so that Austria may be obliged to decline your\r\nproposals.\"\r\n\r\n\"And in this way your highness proposes to bring about a peace with\r\nTurkey?\" asked Prince Gallitzin, astounded.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I do. Austria declines the proposals; Russia moderates her\r\ndemands, that is, she concedes what she never intended to exact, and\r\npresents this as her ultimatum. Austria, satisfied with the concessions\r\nnow offered to her ally, is of opinion that he should accept them; and\r\nif he prove unreasonable, must force him to do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your highness is indeed a great statesman!\" exclaimed Gallitzin, with\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"When a Russian ambassador says so it must be true,\" replied Kaunitz,\r\nbowing. \"As to Poland, the great question there is to preserve the\r\nbalance of power. I beg, therefore, that Russia and Prussia will make\r\nknown at once the extent of their claims there, that Austria may shape\r\nhers accordingly. I shall enter at once into correspondence with the\r\nKing of Prussia, to ascertain his views as to the future boundaries of\r\nPoland. Two things are indispensable to insure the success of this\r\naffair.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"First: perfect frankness between the three powers who are to act as\r\none; and celerity of action, lest Poland should be quieted before we\r\ncome in with our remedy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you. And second?\"\r\n\r\n\"Second: profound secrecy. If France or England were to scent the\r\naffair, there would be troublesome intervention, and we might all be\r\ndisappointed. Europe must not learn the partition of Poland until it is\r\na fait accompli.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise discretion both for Russia and Prussia,\" said Gallitzin,\r\neagerly. \"Europe shall not hear of it until our troops are on the spot\r\nto defend us from outside interference. All that is necessary now is to\r\nfind three equal portions, so that each claimant shall be satisfied.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said Kaunitz carelessly, as he played with the lace that edged is\r\ncuffs, \"if three equal parts are not to be found on Polish ground, we\r\ncan trespass upon the property of another neighbor who has too much\r\nland; and if he resists, we can very soon bring him to reason.\"\r\n\r\nPrince Gallitzin looked with visible astonishment at the cold and calm\r\nface of the Austrian. \"Another neighbor?\" echoed he, with embarrassment.\r\n\"But we have no neighbor unless it be the Porte himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely the neighbor to whom I have reference,\" said Kaunitz, nodding\r\nhis head. \"He is almost as troublesome as Poland, and will be the better\r\nfor a little blood-letting. I authorize your highness to lay these\r\npropositions before your court; and I await the answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" cried Gallitzin, laughing while he arose from his chair, \"you will\r\nalways find Russia ready for a surgical operation upon the body of her\r\nhereditary enemy. The law, both of nature and of necessity, impels her\r\nto prey upon Turkey, and the will of Peter the Great can never be\r\ncarried out until the foot of Russia rests upon the Sultans throne at\r\nStamboul.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Kaunitz, when Prince Gallitzin had taken his leave, \"did\r\nyou understand our conference, Binder?\"\r\n\r\n\"Understand!\" exclaimed Binder, coming from behind the screen. \"No,\r\nindeed! I must have been drunk or dreaming. I surely did not hear your\r\nhighness, who, not an hour since, concluded a treaty with Turkey by\r\nwhich the independence of Poland was to be guaranteed--I surely did not\r\nhear you agree to a partition between Russia, Prussia, and Austria!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you did. We are driven to accept our share of Poland merely by way\r\nof decreasing that of our neighbors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I DID understand as regards Poland. But I must have been dreaming\r\nwhen I thought you had told me that we had concluded a treaty with the\r\nPorte by which he pays us ten millions of piasters for our good offices\r\nwith Russia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. I certainly told you so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, dear prince, I have lost my senses,\" cried Binder, \"for indeed I\r\ndreamed that you had proposed to Russia, in case there was not land\r\nenough to satisfy you all in Poland, to take some from the Sultan. \"\r\n\r\n\"You have heard aright. You are very tiresome with your questions and\r\nyour stupid, wonder-stricken face. I suppose if a piece of Poland were\r\nthrown at your feet, you would pick it up and hand it over to\r\nStanislaus; and if the Porte stood before you with a million of\r\npiasters, you would say, 'Not for the world!' It is easy to see what\r\nwould become of Austria in your dainty hands! An enviable position she\r\nwould hold, if conscience were to guide her policy!\"\r\n\r\n\"No danger while YOU hold the reins, for there will never be a trace of\r\nconscience in your policy,\" muttered Binder, gathering up his papers and\r\npassing into the adjoining room.\r\n\r\nPrince Kaunitz shrugged his shoulders and rang his bell.\r\n\r\n\"My new state-coach,\" said he to Hippolyte, who, instead of flying off\r\nas usual to obey, remained standing at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you stand there?\" asked the Prince.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your highness, the state-coach is not ready,\" stammered the\r\nvalet.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet ready?\" repeated the prince, accenting each word. \"Did I not\r\norder it to be here at two o'clock?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your highness, but the upholsterer could not understand the\r\ndrawings which were given him. He began to work by them, but was obliged\r\nto undo his work, and this caused the delay.\"\r\n\r\n\"The man has the assurance to say that he could not work after the\r\ndrawings made by my own hand?\" asked Kaunitz, with a firey glance of\r\nanger in his eyes. \"Because he is an ass does the churl dare to\r\ncriticise my drawings? Let him bring the body of the coach to the\r\npalace, and I will show him that he is a bungler and knows nothing of\r\nhis trade.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the prince, in his rage, stalked to the door. Suddenly he stopped.\r\n\"What is the state of the thermometer to-day?\" said he.\r\n\r\nThe valet flew to the window and examined the little thermometer that\r\nhung outside.\r\n\r\n\"Sixty degrees, your highness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sixty degrees!\" sighed the prince. \"Then I dare not go to the\r\ncoach-house. Is the coach mounted on the wheels?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your highness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let the upholsterer have the carriage brought to my room, with the\r\ndrawings and his tools. Be off! In ten minutes all must be here!\"\r\n\r\nJust ten minutes later the door opened, and in came a handbarrow, upon\r\nwhich stood the body of the coach. It was one mass of bronze,\r\nplate-glass mirrors, and gilding. Behind it appeared the upholsterer,\r\npale with fright, carrying on one arm a bundle of satin and velvet, and\r\nin his right hand holding the drawings of the prince. \"Set it down in\r\nthe centre of the room,\" said Kaunitz, imperiously, and then turning a\r\nlook of wrath upon the unhappy upholsterer, he said, with terrible\r\nemphasis: \"Is it true that you have the audacity to say that you cannot\r\nwork after my drawings?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope your highness will forgive me,\" stammered the upholsterer, \"but\r\nthere is not room in the inside of the coach for all the bows and\r\nrosettes. I would have been obliged to make them so small that the coach\r\nwould have looked like one of the patterns we show to our customers. \"\r\n\r\n\"And you dare tell me that to my face? Do you suppose that I do not know\r\nyour miserable trade, or do you mean that it is easier to govern an\r\nempire than to trim up a coach? I will prove to you that I am a better\r\nupholsterer than you are. Open the door, and I will decorate the coach\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\nThe upholsterer opened the richly-gilded glass door, and Kaunitz, as\r\nmuch in earnest as when he had been giving and taking a kingdom, entered\r\nthe coach and seated himself.\r\n\r\n\"Give me the satin and velvet, and hold up the drawings, that I may work\r\nafter them. Some of you hand me the nails, and some one have the needle\r\nready. You shall see how Prince Kaunitz, through the stupidity of his\r\nupholsterer, is obliged to decorate the interior of his own coach.\"\r\n\r\nThe prince began to work; and in the same room where he had signed\r\ntreaties and received ambassadors, the great Austrian statesman sewed\r\nand hammered until he had decorated his carriage to his own\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST PETITION.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa paced her cabinet in visible agitation. Her face was sad\r\nbeyond expression, and her eyes turned anxiously toward the door.\r\n\r\n\"I tremble,\" murmured she; \"for the first time in my life I mistrust the\r\ndeed I am about to do. All is not clear in the depths of my conscience;\r\nthe voice that whispers such misgivings to my heart, is one which shames\r\nthe worldly wisdom of my councillors. We are about to do a wicked deed,\r\nand we shall answer for it before Heaven! Would that my right hand had\r\nlost its cunning, ere ever it had been forced to sign this cruel\r\ndocument! Oh, it is an unholy thing, this alliance with an unbelieving\r\nking and a dissolute empress! And an alliance for what? To destroy a\r\nkingdom, and to rob its unhappy people of their nationality forever!\"\r\n\r\n\"But what avails remorse?\" continued she, heaving a deep sigh. \"It is\r\ntoo late, too late! In a few moments Joseph will be here to exact my\r\nsignature, and I dare not refuse it. I have yielded my right to protest\r\nagainst this crime, and--ah, he comes!\" cried the empress, pressing her\r\nhands upon her heart, as she heard the lock of the door turning.\r\n\r\nShe fell into an arm-chair and trembled violently. But it was not the\r\nemperor who appeared as the door opened; it was the Baroness von\r\nSalmour, governess to the archduchesses.\r\n\r\n\"Baroness!\" cried the empress, \"it must be something of most imminent\r\nimportance that brings you hither. What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I come in the name of misfortune to ask of your majesty a favor,\" said\r\nthe baroness, earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"Speak, then, and speak quickly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will your majesty grant an audience to my unhappy country-woman, the\r\nCountess Wielopolska?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Countess Anna!\" said the empress, with a shudder. Then, as if\r\nashamed of her agitation, she added, quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Admit her. If the emperor comes, let him enter also.\"\r\n\r\nThe baroness courtesied and withdrew, but she left the door open; and\r\nnow was seen advancing the tall and graceful figure of the countess. Her\r\nface was pale as that of the dead. She still wore her black velvet\r\ndress, and the long veil which fell around her person, hovered about her\r\nlike a dark, storm-heralding cloud.\r\n\r\n\"She looks like the angel of death,\" murmured the empress. \"It seems to\r\nme that if those pale, transparent hands, which she folds over her\r\nbreast, were to unclasp, her icy breath would still the beatings of my\r\nheart forever!\"\r\n\r\nThe countess glided in like a vision, and the door closed behind her.\r\nThe empress received her with an affable smile.\r\n\r\n\"It is very long since I have seen you,\" said the proud Maria Theresa,\r\nwith an embarrassment to which her rank had hitherto made her a\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\n\"I was waiting to be summoned by your majesty,\" replied the countess.\r\n\r\n\"And as I did not summon you, you came voluntarily. That was kind. I am\r\nvery glad to see you.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady replied to these flattering words by an inclination of the\r\nhead, and a pause ensued. Each one seemed waiting for the other to\r\nspeak. As the empress perceived, after a while, that the lips of the\r\npale countess did not move, she resolved to break the irksome silence\r\nherself. In her own frank way, scorning all circumlocution, she went at\r\nonce to the subject nearest their hearts.\r\n\r\n\"I know why you are here to-day,\" said she, with a painful blush. \"You\r\nhave heard of the fate which threatens Poland, and you have come to ask\r\nif thus I fulfil the promises I made to you! Speak--is it not so? Have I\r\nnot rightly read the meaning of that lovely but joyless face?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is so,\" sighed the countess, and her voice trembled with unshed\r\ntears. \"Yes, from the solitude wherein I had buried my grief since last\r\nI saw your majesty, I have heard the fatal tidings of my country's woe,\r\nand yet I live! Oh, why should the body survive, when the soul is dead?\"\r\n\r\nHer words died away upon her lips, and she seemed to grow paler and more\r\npale as though every drop of blood in her veins had stiffened and turned\r\nto ice. But she heaved a sigh and rallied, for hope now touched her\r\nheart, and the statue awoke to life.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, great empress,\" said she, with fervor, \"I come to you, in whose\r\npowerful hand lies the issue of my country's fate, whose mighty word can\r\nbid us live, or doom us to death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, were it so, you would not sue in vain!\" cried the empress,\r\nsorrowfully. \"Had the fate of Poland lain in MY hands, she would have\r\nrisen triumphant from the arena, where she has battled so bravely for\r\nher sacred rights!\"\r\n\r\n\"Poland's fate lies in your majesty's hand!\" exclaimed the countess,\r\nvehemently. \"You have not yet signed the warrant for my country's\r\nexecution; you are still innocent of her blood; your hand is still free\r\nfrom participation in the crime of her enemies and yours! Oh, let me\r\nkiss that hand and bless it, while yet it is spotless and pure as your\r\nnoble heart.\"\r\n\r\nHurried away by the might of the sorrow that overwhelmed her, the\r\ncountess darted forward, and throwing herself at the feet of the\r\nempress, drew her hand fervently to her lips.\r\n\r\n\"Rise, dear countess Anna, rise,\" said the empress, soothingly. \"I cannot\r\nbear to see you at my feet, when I can do nothing to avert the fate of\r\nPoland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who, then, can help her, if not your majesty?\" cried the countess. \"Oh,\r\nI did not come hither to reproach you; I came but to entreat you to\r\nspeak the word that will disenthrall my country!\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot do it; as God hears me, I cannot,\" repeated Maria Theresa, in\r\na voice of anguish. \"I have striven against it with all my might. What I\r\nhave suffered for your countrymen, no one will ever know! The anxious\r\ndays and wretched nights that I have spent for their sakes, have\r\nthreatened my life.\" [Footnote: The empress's own words. See Raumer,\r\n\"Contributions to Modern History,\" vol. iv., p. 539.]\r\n\r\n\"I CANNOT!\" echoed the countess, who seemed to have heard nothing but\r\nthese few words. \"An empress!--an empress! who, with a wave of her hand,\r\nsways millions of men, and is responsible for her actions to no earthly\r\npower!\"\r\n\r\n\"Save that which resides in the claims of her subjects upon the\r\nsovereign, who is bound to reign for their good. I am responsible to my\r\npeople for the preservation of peace. Too much blood has been shed since\r\nI came to the throne; and nothing would induce me to be the cause that\r\nthe soil of Austria should be crimsoned by another drop.\" [Footnote: The\r\nempress's own words. See Wolf, \"Austria under Maria Theresa,\" p. 527.]\r\n\r\n\"And to spare a drop of Austrian blood, your majesty will deal the blow\r\nthat murders a whole nation!\" cried the countess, rising to her feet and\r\nlooking defiance at the empress. \"In your egotism for Austria, you turn\r\nfrom a noble nation who have as good a right to freedom as your own\r\npeople!\"\r\n\r\n\"Countess, you forget yourself. By what right do you reprove me?\"\r\n\r\n\"By the right which misfortune gives to truth,\" replied she, proudly,\r\n\"and by the right which your imperial word has given me to speak. For\r\nnow I recall to you that promise, and I ask where is the eagle that was\r\nto swoop down upon the vultures which are preying upon Poland?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they have caged the eagle,\" said the empress, sadly. \"God in heaven\r\nknows how manfully I have battled for Poland. When I threatened\r\ninterference, the answer was this: 'We have resolved to dismember\r\nPoland, and you shall not prevent us.' What, then, could I do? Declare\r\nwar? That were to ruin my people. Remain passive, while my enemies\r\nenlarged their frontiers, so as to endanger my own? We then had recourse\r\nto stratagem. We defended our soil inch by inch, and gave up when\r\nresistance became fanaticism. We required for our share more than we\r\ndesired, hoping to be refused. But no! To my sorrow and disappointment,\r\neven more was apportioned than we had claimed. Oh! the whole thing has\r\nbeen so repugnant to my sense of justice, that I refused to take any\r\nshare in its arrangements, and all the negotiations have been conducted\r\nby the emperor, Prince Kaunitz and Marshal Lacy.\" [Footnote: This\r\ndiscourse is historical. See Wolf, p. 825. Raumer, vol. iv., p. 540.]\r\n\r\n\"And these are the ashes of the mighty promises of emperors and\r\nempresses!\" exclaimed the countess, bitterly. \"Oh, empress, think of the\r\ntime when you shall appear before God, to give account of your deeds!\r\nHow will you answer, when the record of this day is brought before you?\r\nFor the last time I am at your feet. Oh, as you hope for mercy above, do\r\nnot sign the act that dismembers Poland!\"\r\n\r\nShe was again on her knees; her beautiful eyes drowned in tears, and her\r\nhands clasped convulsively above her head.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my God!\" exclaimed the empress, rising to her feet, \"she does not\r\nbelieve me.\" Then bending tenderly over the countess, she pressed her\r\nhands between her own, and gently raised her to a seat.\r\n\r\n\"Do you not see how deeply I suffer, when I have no spirit to chide your\r\nhard words to me? It is because I comprehend your sorrow, poor child,\r\nthat I forgive your injustice. And now, to prove my sincerity,\" added\r\nshe, going to her escritoire and taking from it a letter, \"read this! I\r\nwas about to send it to Prince Kaunitz when your visit caused me to\r\nforget it. Read it aloud, that I may know whether you understand me at\r\nlast.\"\r\n\r\nThe countess unfolded the letter and read:\r\n\r\n\"When my own empire was threatened, and I knew not where to lay my head;\r\nwhen the sorrows of childbirth were overtaking me, I threw myself upon\r\nGod and my just rights. But to-day, when humanity, justice, ay--reason\r\nitself, cry aloud against our acts, I confess to you that my anxiety\r\ntranscends all that I have ever suffered in my life before. Tell me,\r\nPrince Kaunitz, have you thought of the evil example we are giving to\r\nthe nations of earth, when, for the sake of a few acres of additional\r\nterritory, we cast away our reputation, our dignity, and our honor?\r\n\r\n\"If I yield to-day, it is because I struggle alone, and no longer have\r\nthe vigor of mind to contend for right, as in years gone by I would have\r\ndone. I am overpowered, but I surrender with a bleeding heart.\"\r\n[Footnote: This letter was written by Maria Theresa's own hand. See\r\nHormayer, \"Pocket History of Our Native Land,\" 1831, p. 66.]\r\n\r\nThe countess remained looking at the parer for a time, then she raised\r\nher tearful eyes to the face of the empress. \"I thank your majesty,\"\r\nsaid she, deeply moved, \"for allowing me to see this letter. It will\r\nremain in history as a noble monument of Maria Theresa's rectitude. I\r\nhave no longer a word of blame for you; and once again, in love and\r\nreverence, I kiss this hand, although I know that to-day it must sign\r\nthe death-warrant of unhappy Poland.\"\r\n\r\nShe drew near, and raised the hand of the empress to her lips. But Maria\r\nTheresa threw her arms around the countess, exclaiming: \"To my heart,\r\ndear, unhappy one! I cannot save Poland, but I can weep with her\r\nloveliest and noblest daughter!\"\r\n\r\nThe countess, overcome by this unexpected tenderness, leaned upon the\r\nbosom of the empress, and wept. Maria Theresa stroked her lustrous black\r\nhair, and, as she kissed her marble cheek, the tears that had gathered\r\nin her eyes, fell upon the head of the countess, where they glittered\r\nlike stars upon the darkness of the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVIII.\r\n\r\nFINIS POLONIE.\r\n\r\nNeither saw the door open; but both heard a soft, melodious voice,\r\nsaying: \"Pardon me, your majesty, I thought you were alone.\"\r\n\r\nThe countess uttered a low cry, and trembled from head to foot.\r\n\r\n\"Do not fear,\" said the empress, as she gently withdrew her arms, \"it is\r\nmy son the emperor. We need not hide our tears from him, for he knows\r\nthat this is not the first time his mother has wept for Poland.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor said nothing; he stood staring at the pale and trembling\r\nAnna. He, too, grew deathly pale as he looked, and now his trembling\r\nlimbs answered to the agitation that was overpowering her. Suddenly, as\r\nthough awaking from a painful dream, he approached, and offering his\r\nhand, said:\r\n\r\n\"I rejoice to see you. I have long sought you in vain.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not appear to see him. Her arm hung listlessly at her side,\r\nwhile her figure swayed to and fro like a storm-tossed lily.\r\n\r\n\"I have not been in Vienna,\" answered she, in a voice scarcely audible.\r\n\"I had gone to bury my sorrow in solitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"But her love for Poland brought her hither,\" said the empress, putting\r\nher arm affectionately around the countess's waist.\r\n\r\n\"I believe you,\" returned Joseph, bitterly. \"The fate of Poland is the\r\nonly thing worthy of touching the Countess Wielopolska. She is not a\r\nwoman, she is a Pole--nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nOne low wail struggled from the depths of her breaking heart, but she\r\nspoke not a word.\r\n\r\nThe emperor went on: \"The Countess Wielopolska is not a woman. She is a\r\nmonad, representing patriotism; and he who cannot think as she does, is\r\na criminal unworthy of her regard.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are cruel, my son,\" said the empress, deprecatingly. \"If the\r\ncountess has been bitter in her reproaches to you, we must remember her\r\ngrief and her right to reproach us. We should be gentle with\r\nmisfortune--above all, when we can bring no relief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let him go on, your majesty,\" murmured the wretched Anna, while her\r\neyes were raised with a look of supreme agony upon the stern face of the\r\nemperor.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty is right. I am nothing but a Pole, and I will die with my\r\nfatherland. Your hands shall close our coffin-lids, for our fates will\r\nnot cost you a tear. The dear, noble empress has wept for us both, and\r\nthe remembrance of her sympathy and of your cruelty we will carry with\r\nus to the grave.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor's eyes flashed angrily, and he was about to retort, but he\r\ncontrolled himself and approached the empress.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty will pardon me if I interrupt your interesting\r\nconversation, but state affairs are peremptory, and supersede all other\r\nconsiderations. Your majesty has commanded my presence that I might sign\r\nthe act of partition. The courier, who is to convey the news to Berlin\r\nand St. Petersburg, is ready to go. Allow me to ask if your majesty has\r\nsigned?\"\r\n\r\nThe countess, who understood perfectly that the emperor, in passing her\r\nby, to treat with his mother of this dreadful act of partition, wished\r\nto force her to retire, withdrew silently to the door.\r\n\r\nBut the empress, hurt that her son should have been so unfeeling, went\r\nforward, and led her back to her seat.\r\n\r\n\"No, countess, stay. The emperor says that you represent Poland. Then\r\nlet him justify his acts to us both, and prove that what he has done is\r\nright. I have suffered such anguish of mind over the partition of\r\nPoland, that Joseph would lift a load from my heart, if he could show me\r\nthat it is inevitable. My son, you have come for my signature. Before\r\nGod, your mother, and Poland herself, justify our deed, and I will sign\r\nthe act.\"\r\n\r\n\"Justify? There are many things which we may defend without being able\r\nto justify them: and stern necessity often forces us to the use of\r\nmeasures which conscience disapproves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prove to me, then, the necessity which has forced us to dismember a\r\ncountry whose people have never injured us,\" said the empress,\r\nauthoritatively.\r\n\r\n\"But whose disunion at home has become dangerous to their neighbors.\r\nPoland lies like a sick man in our midst, whose dying breath infects the\r\nland. When there is a fire in our neighborhood, we are sometimes obliged\r\nto tear down the burning house lest the fire spread to our own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" interrupted the countess, \"but you do not rob the neighbor of his\r\nland. The soil belongs to him who owns the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the Poles are not worthy to own their soil. What is Poland to-day?\r\nA race of slaves and peasants, without law or order, driven hither and\r\nthither by a lewd and corrupt aristocracy, who, instead of blushing for\r\nthe degeneracy of their caste, hold their saturnalia over the very\r\ngraves of their noble ancestors. And at the head of this degenerate\r\npeople is their king, the minion of a foreign court, who promulgates the\r\nlaws which he receives from his imperial Russian mistress. Verily, God\r\nhas weighed the Polish nation in His balance, and they have been found\r\nwanting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough!\" faltered the countess, raising her hand in deprecation. \"Why\r\nwill you vilify a people who are in the throes of death?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it is not enough,\" said the emperor, sternly. \"The empress says\r\nthat I must justify the acts of the three powers to Poland--that pale\r\nand beautiful statue before me which lives--and yet is not a woman. I\r\nsay it again: a nation dies by its own corruption! Poland bears within\r\nherself the seeds of her destruction. Her people have been false to\r\ntheir antecedents, false to themselves, to their honor, and even to\r\ntheir faith.\" [Footnote: Wolf. \"Austria under Maria Theresa.\" p. 535.]\r\n\r\n\"You accuse, but you bring no proofs!\" exclaimed the countess, her eyes\r\nnow flashing with wounded pride.\r\n\r\n\"It will not be difficult to collect my proofs,\" said the emperor,\r\nsneering. \"Look at what takes place in Poland, since your countrymen\r\nhave foreseen the fate of their fatherland. What are the Polish diet\r\ndoing since they anticipate the close of their sittings? Voting\r\nthemselves pensions, property, and every conceivable revenue, at the\r\nexpense of the republic, and giving her, with their own parricidal\r\nhands, the coup de grace. Such shameless corruption has never come to\r\nlight in the history of any other nation. Freedom and fatherland are in\r\nevery mouth, but, in reality, no people care less for either than do the\r\nPoles. Slaves, who, while they hold out their hands to be manacled, are\r\nstriving to reign over other slaves! [Footnote: Raumer, \"Contributions,\"\r\nVol. iv., p. 551.] This is a picture of the Poland whom you love, and\r\nthrough her own crimes she is dying.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not true!\" cried the indignant countess. \"She dies through the\r\ncovetousness and greed of her neighbors. It is they who have sown\r\ndissension in Poland, while forcing upon her unhappy people a king who\r\nis nothing but the despicable tool of their despicable intrigues.\"\r\n\r\n\"All this has no reference to Austria,\" objected the emperor. \"We had\r\nnothing to do with the selection of the king--nothing to do with the\r\nprojects of dismemberment. They were resolved upon, with or without our\r\nsanction, and the law of self-preservation demands that if we cannot\r\nprevent, we must endeavor to profit by them. I know that the partition\r\nof Poland has an appearance of gross outrage which is obvious to every\r\neye; while the stringent necessity which has driven Austria to\r\nparticipate in it is known to few. I confess that I would be grieved if\r\nthe world should misjudge me on this question; for I try, both in public\r\nand private life, to be an honest man; and I believe that honesty in\r\nstatesmanship is the wisest and soundest policy. [Footnote: The\r\nemperor's own words. See Raumer, \"Contributions,\" &c., Vol. iv., p.\r\n539.] We could not do otherwise than we have done, and now, with the\r\nfull conviction of the exigency which has called for the act, I repeat\r\nmy question to your majesty, have you signed the act, or will you be so\r\nkind as to sign it now?\"\r\n\r\nThe empress had listened with profound attention to her son's discourse,\r\nand her countenance, which before had been pale with anxiety, had\r\nassumed an expression of blended serenity and resolution. A pause\r\nensued. Marble-white and speechless the countess, with half-open mouth,\r\nstarted and bent forward, her eyes fixed upon the empress; the emperor,\r\nstern and proud, threw back his head and gazed defiantly.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this throbbing silence, Maria Theresa went forward and\r\ntook her seat at the escritoire. She dipped her pen in the silver\r\ninkstand, and a sob, that sounded like the last death-sigh, escaped from\r\nthe lips of the countess. The empress turned quickly around; but the\r\nglance of her eye was resolute and her hand was firm.\r\n\r\nShe bent over the parchment and wrote; then, throwing her pen on the\r\nfloor, she turned to the emperor and pointed with her right hand to the\r\ndeed. \"Placet,\" cried she, with her clear, ringing voice--\"placet, since\r\nso many great and wise men will have it so. When I am dead, the world\r\nwill learn what came of this violation of all that man holds sacred.\"\r\n[Footnote: The empress's own words.]\r\n\r\nAnd either that she might conceal her own emotion, or avoid an outburst\r\nof grief from the countess, the empress walked hastily through the room,\r\nand shut herself up in her dressing-room.\r\n\r\nThe countess moaned, and murmuring, \"Finis Poloniae!\" she, too,\r\nattempted to cross the room.\r\n\r\nThe emperor watched her, his eyes beaming with tenderness, his heart a\r\nprey to violent anguish. As she reached the door, he saw her reel and\r\ncling to a column for support.\r\n\r\nWith one bound he reached her, and flinging his arms around her swaying\r\nfigure, she fell, almost unconscious, upon his bosom. For one\r\nbewildering moment she lay there.\r\n\r\n\"Finis Poloniae!\" murmured she again, and, drawing herself up to her\r\nfull height, she again approached the door.\r\n\r\n\"Farewell!\" said she, softly.\r\n\r\nThe emperor seized her hand. \"Anna,\" said he, imploringly, \"Anna, do we\r\npart thus? Is this our last interview? Shall we never meet again?\"\r\n\r\nShe turned, and all the love that she had struggled to conquer was in\r\nher eyes as they met his. \"We shall meet once more,\" replied she.\r\n\r\n\"When?\" cried Joseph, frantic with grief.\r\n\r\n\"When the hour has come for us to meet again, I will send for you.\r\nPromise to be there to receive my last farewell.\"\r\n\r\n\"I swear to be there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, farewell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, beloved Anna! Oh, let me touch your hand once more!\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" said she, harshly; and, opening the door, she disappeared, and the\r\nemperor was left alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE MAD COUNTESS.\r\n\r\nCount Starhemberg paced his splendid drawing-room in a state of great\r\nexcitement. Sometimes he murmured broken sentences, then he sighed\r\nheavily, and again he seemed to be a prey to fear. Occasionally, his\r\neyes glanced almost reproachfully toward the figure of a young man, who,\r\nwith folded arms and smiling countenance, stood in the embrasure of a\r\nwindow watching the old man's agitation.\r\n\r\nAs the clock on the marble mantel struck the hour, the count stopped\r\nbefore his young visitor, and looked searchingly at his mild and\r\neffeminate farce.\r\n\r\n\"The half hour has elapsed, Count Esterhazy,\" said he, solemnly. \"I have\r\ntold you frankly that my niece, although a beautiful and perchance a\r\ngood-hearted woman, has a temper which is the terror of my household.\r\nShe inherits this misfortune from her deceased father, and, unhappily,\r\nher lovely and amiable mother did not long survive him. There has been\r\nno one, therefore, to control her; and her terrible temper has never\r\nbeen restrained. Do not say to me that I might have conquered it! I have\r\ndedicated my whole life to her; and lest she should make another being\r\nunhappy, I have remained a bachelor, as you perceive. But I had made a\r\nsolemn promise to her parents that I would be a father to her, and I\r\nhave kept my promise. It is not my fault if their child is less amiable\r\nthan other women. She has an energetic character, and I fear that if she\r\nmarries, she will find means to tyrannize over her husband. I repeat\r\nthis to you count, that we may clearly understand each other; and now\r\nthat the half hour has gone by, do you still urge your suit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, count, I do,\" replied Esterhazy in a, soft, treble voice. \"I\r\nrepeat to you the offer of my hand to the Countess Margaret\r\nStarhemberg.\"\r\n\r\nThe count bowed. \"I have done my duty, and, being cleared of all\r\nresponsibility in the affair, I give my consent. You must now try to win\r\nhers.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would like to see the countess in your presence,\" said Esterhazy,\r\nunmoved.\r\n\r\nCount Starhemberg rang the bell, and ordered a servant to bear a request\r\nto his niece to join him in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\"The countess would have the honor of joining her uncle immediately,\"\r\nwas the answer.\r\n\r\n\"This promises well,\" said the old count, looking relieved. \"She\r\ngenerally practises her music at this hour; and I am surprised that--\"\r\n\r\nJust then the sharp tones of an angry female voice were heard without,\r\nthen the jingling of glasses, then a crash, and the fall of some heavy\r\nmetallic body.\r\n\r\n\"That is my niece,\" said the old man with a shiver. \"With that fanfare\r\nshe usually announces her coming.\"\r\n\r\nNow the door was flung violently open, and a tall, magnificent woman\r\ndashed into the room. Her features, marvellously chiselled as those of\r\nthe antique Venus, would have been irresistible in beauty, if their\r\nexpression had corresponded to their symmetry--But in her large black\r\neyes glared the fire of ungoverned passion, and her rosy mouth was\r\ncurled with contempt.\r\n\r\nHer tall figure was of exquisite proportions; and her arms, adorned but\r\nnot hidden by the lace which fell from the short sleeves of her crimson\r\nvelvet dress, were as fair and beautiful as those of the Venus of Milo.\r\n\r\nCount Esterhazy, intoxicated by the sight of her wondrous beauty,\r\nwithdrew abashed behind the window-curtain, while the countess, graceful\r\nas an angry leopardess, bounded through the room, and stood before her\r\nuncle.\r\n\r\n\"Who has annoyed you, my child?\" asked he timidly.\r\n\r\n\"He is an idiot, an awkward animal, and shall be driven from the house\r\nwith the lash!\" cried she. \"Just imagine, uncle, that as I was coming\r\nhither, I met him in the anteroom with a plateau of cups and glasses.\r\nWhen he saw me, the fool fell to trembling as if he had seen an evil\r\nspirit--the plateau shook; and my dear mother's last gift, the goblet\r\nfrom which she had cooled her dying lips, fell to the floor and was\r\nbroken.\"\r\n\r\nHer voice, at first so loud and angry, was now soft and pathetic, and\r\nher eyes glistened with tears. She shook them off impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"I can well understand, dear child, how much it must have grieved you to\r\nlose this precious relic,\" said her uncle, soothingly.\r\n\r\nShe blushed as though she had been surprised in a fault.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it was not that,\" said she, pettishly, \"it is all the same to me\r\nwhether the goblet was a relic or not, for I hate sentiment. But I\r\ndetest such an awkward fool. He never COULD carry any thing without\r\nletting it fall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, my child, he has often carried you for hours in his arms, and yet\r\nhe never let you fall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle, your jests are insupportable,\" cried she, stamping with her\r\nlittle satin-slippered foot upon the carpet. \"You excuse this\r\ngray-headed dunce merely to vex me, and to remind me that I am an orphan\r\nwithout a home.\"\r\n\r\n\"But my dear--\"\r\n\r\n\"Peace! I will not be interrupted. If I am tyrannized over in every\r\nother way, I will at least claim the right to speak--I wish to say that\r\nthis old plague shall not remain here another day to torment my life\r\nwith his nonsense. This time, however, I made him feel the weight of my\r\nhand. His face was as red as my dress after it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You struck my faithful old Isidor?\" cried the count, shocked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did,\" replied she, looking defiantly into her uncle's mild face.\r\n\"I beat him well, and then I threw the whole waiter of cups and glasses\r\nupon the floor. Have you any fault to find with that, my sympathizing\r\nuncle?\"\r\n\r\n\"None, none,\" said the old man. \"If it gave you pleasure to break the\r\nglasses, we will go out and buy others.\"\r\n\r\n\"WE! No, indeed, we shall not. Isidor shall pay for them from his wages.\r\nIt was his fault that I was obliged to break them, and no one shall\r\nsuffer for it except himself. I claim that as an act of bare justice to\r\nmyself. \"\r\n\r\n\"But, my dear countess--\"\r\n\r\nShe stamped her foot again. \"Great God! have you no object in life\r\nexcept that of contradicting and ill-treating me?\"\r\n\r\nThe count sighed and approached the door. She heard him, and an exulting\r\nsmile lit up her beautiful, stormy face.\r\n\r\n\"Well, as you will not tell him, I shall do it myself. Yes--I shall do\r\nit myself. Do you hear, uncle? You shall not say a word to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will say nothing, Margaret. Will you now allow me to speak of other\r\nthings? Is your vehemence--\"\r\n\r\n\"UNCLE!\"\r\n\r\n\"In your just displeasure, you have overlooked the fact that we are not\r\nalone.\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the window where, half hidden by the heavy silk drapery,\r\nstood Count Frank Esterhazy. The countess followed her uncle's glance,\r\nand as she became aware of the visitor's presence, burst into a merry\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\"Do not be frightened, young man,\" said she then; \"you may come out from\r\nyour corner. I am not a cat, and I don't devour mice. Ah, you have heard\r\nour discussion? What a pity you are not a dramatic poet, you have had\r\nsuch an opportunity for depicting a foolish old guardian and his\r\nspirited ward!\"\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately, I am not a poet,\" said the young count, coming forward\r\nand bowing to the floor. \"If I were, I could write to-day a hundred\r\nsonnets to the eyes of the majestic Hera whose anger heightens her\r\nwonderful beauty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle,\" said the countess, suddenly assuming a stately and court-like\r\ndemeanor, \"be so good as to present me this young stranger, who pays\r\nsuch insipid compliments.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear niece, let me introduce Count Frank Esterhazy, a nobleman just\r\nreturned from Italy, who is in high favor with the empress.\"\r\n\r\n\"The latter is no recommendation, uncle, for am I not also a favorite\r\nwith the empress? Have you not often told me so, when the empress was\r\nhumbling me with some of her tyrannical condescension?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, my child, I have said so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you see that it is not necessary to be estimable for one to gain\r\nthe empress's good-will. For my part, I wish she loved me less, for then\r\nshe would spare me some of the long sermons with which she edifies me,\r\nwhen I happen to appear at court.\"\r\n\r\n\"That, probably, is the reason you appear so seldom,\" said Count\r\nEsterhazy. \"I have heard your absence complained of.\"\r\n\r\n\"By her majesty?\" asked Count Starhemberg.\r\n\r\n\"No, your excellency, by the emperor.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dare I repeat his words?\" asked Esterhazy, appealing to the countess.\r\nShe bowed her head, and leaned against the back of an arm-chair.\r\n\r\n\"I was yesterday at the empress's reception. The emperor was so kind as\r\nto do the honors of the court to me. He pointed out the several beauties\r\nof Vienna, who were all strangers to me--'But,' said he, 'the most\r\nbeautiful woman in Austria I cannot show you, for she is not here. The\r\nCountess Margaret von Starhemberg has the beauty of Juno and Venus\r\nunited.'\"\r\n\r\nThe countess said nothing; she stood with downcast eyes. Her cheek had\r\npaled, and her lips were firmly compressed together. Suddenly she\r\nrallied and said, with a careless laugh\r\n\r\n\"I wager that the empress and her ladies made some amiable commentary on\r\nthe emperor's words. Come, tell me, what said the empress?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you command me, countess, I will tell you. The empress added, with a\r\nsigh, 'It is true, she is as beautiful as a goddess, but it is Eris whom\r\nshe resembles.\"'\r\n\r\n\"Very witty!\" exclaimed the countess, with a sneer.\r\n\r\n\"And the emperor?\" inquired the uncle.\r\n\r\n\"The emperor frowned at the ladies, who began to laugh. 'Your majesty\r\nmay be right,' said he, 'but Grecian mythology has forgotten to say\r\nwhether the fierce goddess was ever vanquished by love. Love tames the\r\nmost turbulent of women.\"'\r\n\r\nThe countess uttered a sharp cry, and caught with both her hands at the\r\nback of the arm-chair. Her eyes closed, and a deadly paleness overspread\r\nher countenance. Her uncle hastened to put his arm around her, inquiring\r\ntenderly, \"Dearest child, what ails you?\"\r\n\r\nShe leaned for a while upon his shoulder; then raising her head while\r\ndeep blushes crimsoned her cheeks, she said, haughtily: \"It is nothing.\r\nA sudden faintness to which I am subject.\" With an inclination of the\r\nhead to Count Esterhazy, she continued\r\n\r\n\"You will be so good as not to mention this weakness of mine. It is\r\npurely physical, and I hope to conquer it in time. I am rejoiced to\r\nthink that I have verified the words of the empress and have appeared\r\nbefore you to-day as an Eris. I suppose you came hither to see me out of\r\ncuriosity.\"\r\n\r\n\"No Countess Margaret, the purport of my visit was any thing but\r\ncuriosity. I come, with the sanction of your guardian, to offer you my\r\nhand.\"\r\n\r\nThe black eyes of the countess darted fire at the smiling suitor.\r\n\r\n\"You do not answer me,\" said he blandly. \"I say that I have won the\r\nconsent of your uncle, and respectfully solicit yours. It shall be the\r\nstudy of my life to make you happy, and, perhaps, at some future day, my\r\nuntiring devotion may win a return of my love. Speak, then, countess;\r\nsay that you will be my wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never, never!\" cried she, stretching forth her arms as though to ward\r\naway some threatening evil. \"I shall never be the wife of any man. I was\r\nnot made for marriage, I cannot bow my will before that of any other\r\nfellow-mortal.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not require you to do so,\" replied the count, as though he had\r\nnow removed every objection. \"You will be in my house as you are here,\r\nabsolute mistress of all things, and I shall claim nothing but the right\r\nof being your humblest and most devoted servant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unhappily for you, you know not what you claim,\" exclaimed the countess\r\nangrily. \"Ask my uncle, ask his household, and they will tell you that I\r\nam a tyrant, changing my will twenty times an hour; hating to-day the\r\nthing I shall love to-morrow. You would aspire to be my husband, would\r\nyou? Have you no friends to warn you of the reefs upon which you are\r\nrunning that poor little crazy bark of yours? Why the very people, as\r\nthey see me pass, tell of my frantic doings; and every child in Vienna\r\nknows that I beat my servants, rage about my uncle's house like the foul\r\nfiend, and dash through the streets on horseback like the Wild\r\nHuntsman.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Love tames the wildest hearts,' so says the emperor.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret started, and darted a fiery glance at his tranquil face.\r\n\r\n\"But I do not love you, I tell you; and it is useless to say another\r\nword on the subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" said the count, taking her hand, \"it is not useless. I beseech\r\nyou, do not deny my suit.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the door opened, and a servant came in with a golden\r\ntray, on which lay a letter.\r\n\r\n\"From her majesty the empress,\" said the servant, handing it to Count\r\nStarhemberg. The count took the letter and went into the embrasure of\r\nthe window, while the servant retired noiselessly.\r\n\r\n\"Countess Margaret,\" said Count Esterhazy, in an imploring voice, \"once\r\nmore I entreat you to accept me as your husband.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with withering contempt. \"Have I not told you,\" cried\r\nshe, passionately, \"that I do not love you? A man of honor ceases to\r\nimportune a woman after such an avowal.\"\r\n\r\n\"A man of spirit never gives up; he perseveres, in the hope that sooner\r\nor later, he will reach his goal. No man has the right to expect that he\r\nwill obtain a treasure without trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cant! miserable cant!\" And the great glowing eyes that were looking\r\nwith such scorn at the alight figure of the count, encountered their own\r\nimage in the glass before which they both were standing.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" cried she, pointing to the mirror, \"yonder reflection gives its\r\nanswer to your suit. Do you see that tall woman, whose head towers above\r\nthe blond mannikin that stands beside her? Look at her black hair, her\r\nfiery eyes, and resolute bearing! And now look at the little fair-haired\r\npuppet, that resembles a man about as much as do the statuettes on my\r\ntoilet-table. Ah, sir count, if you were the woman and I the man there\r\nmight be marriage between us! But as it is, you would die of my\r\nviolence, or I of your insipidity. So, excuse me.\"\r\n\r\nShe made a deep courtesy and turned to leave the room. But she felt a\r\ntouch upon her shoulder, and looking back, she saw her uncle gazing at\r\nher with a face of great anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"My child,\" said he, in a faltering voice, \"do not send Count Esterhazy\r\nso rudely away. He is rich, noble, and distinguished, and in every way\r\nworthy of my lovely niece. Do not refuse him, Margaret.\"\r\n\r\n\"The count has recovered from his stupid delusion, uncle; I have told\r\nhim how impossible it is for me to accept his hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my poor child, you must try to love him. You dare not reject his\r\noffer.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! _I_ dare not reject whom I please!\" cried she, in a voice shrill\r\nwith passion.\r\n\r\n\"No, you dare not. The empress commands you to accept the hand of Count\r\nEsterhazy. Here is the note I have at this moment received from her\r\nmajesty.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret tore the paper savagely from her uncle's hand. With staring\r\neyes she read its contents, while her whole body trembled violently, and\r\nher lips were bloody with the efforts she was making to suppress a\r\nscream.\r\n\r\nAt last she gave it back. \"Read it,\" said she, hoarsely; \"the letters\r\nswim before my eyes.\"\r\n\r\nThe count took the note and read:\r\n\r\n\"Dear Count Starhemberg: It is my desire that your niece, the Countess\r\nMargaret, shall become the wife of some honorable man. In this way she\r\nmay hope to conquer her ungovernable temper, and become a reasonable\r\nwoman. I have heard that Count Esterhazy intends to become her suitor,\r\nand I command her to accept his hand. She has led a life of wild\r\nindependence, and it is time she were tamed by the cares, duties, and\r\nresponsibilities of matrimony. I am both her empress and godmother, and\r\nI use my double right for her good. The marriage shall take place in one\r\nweek, or she goes into a convent. That is my ultimatum. \"I remain yours\r\nwith sentiments of esteem, \"MARIA THERESA.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXX.\r\n\r\nTHE BETROTHAL.\r\n\r\nA long pause ensued after the reading of the letter. The countess stood\r\nwith her eyes riveted upon her uncle's face, as though she were waiting\r\nfor something more. The young count watched her furtively, but he looked\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\n\"You see, my child,\" at last sighed the old count, \"it is inevitable.\r\nThe empress must be obeyed.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" screamed the wretched girl, awaking from her stupor, \"I will\r\nnot be the wife of that man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you will have to go into a convent.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" cried she, her face suddenly lighting up with a flash of\r\nhope--\"no, I will do neither. There is a means of rescuing me from\r\nboth.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned with a bewitching smile to Count Esterhazy, and in a voice\r\nwhose softness was music to his ear, she addressed him:\r\n\r\n\"In your hands lies the power to rescue me from a forced bridal. You\r\nhave heard that despotic note from the empress. Match-making is a\r\nmonomania with Maria Theresa: it is useless, therefore, for me to appeal\r\nto her, for on a question of marriage she is inexorable. But you, Count\r\nEsterhazy,\" continued she, in tones of caressing melody, \"you will\r\nrescue me, will you not? I cannot be your wife, for I do not love you; I\r\ncannot go into a convent, for I have no piety. Go, then, to the empress,\r\nand tell her that you do not wish to marry me. You, at least, are free.\r\nRefuse to accept me for your wife, and this miserable comedy is at an\r\nend.\"\r\n\r\nShe had clasped her little white hands, and was looking imploringly in\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\nThe young man shook his head. \"I cannot say this to the empress,\" said\r\nhe, quietly, \"for it is she who sent me hither to woo you.\"\r\n\r\n\"The empress sent you hither!\" cried the countess, springing forward\r\nlike a lioness. \"You came not as a free suitor, but as an obedient slave\r\nof the empress.\"\r\n\r\n\"I came at the command of the empress,\" said the young man, mildly.\r\n\r\nThe countess burst into a loud laugh.\r\n\r\n\"That, then, was the glowing love which you were describing just now;\r\nthat your tender wish to live for my happiness alone. Obedient\r\nschool-boy! You were told to come and ask for my hand, and you came--for\r\nfear of being whipped--Oh! why am I not a man? By the heaven above! no\r\nwoman should inflict upon me such contumely!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" said Count Esterhazy, taking no note of her words, \"that\r\nthe empress ordered me hither. But since I have seen you, I need no\r\nprompting save that of my own heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Peace, fool! nobody believes you. You had consented to woo me, in\r\nobedience to your despotic sovereign. But you have seen me; now you know\r\nwith how much justice I am called 'The Mad Countess,' and now, surely,\r\nyou have manhood enough to reject a termagant like me. Go, then, and\r\ntell the empress that I was willing, but you were not--\"\r\n\r\n\"I would not thus belie you, lovely Margaret.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do I care whether you belie me or not, so that I am rid of you?\"\r\nsaid she, contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\"Submit, my dear child,\" said the old count, with tears in his eyes.\r\n\"'Tis the first time in your life that you have been thwarted, and\r\ntherefore it is hard for you to succumb.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not submit!\" cried Margaret, flinging back her head. \"I will not\r\nmarry this man. Uncle, dear uncle, leave me one moment with him. I have\r\nsomething to say that he alone must hear.\"\r\n\r\nThe count withdrew at once into another room.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir, that we are alone, I have a secret to reveal--to God and to\r\nyourself. Swear by the memory of your mother that you will not betray\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"I swear.\"\r\n\r\nShe bowed her head, as though accepting the oath. \"And now,\" raid she,\r\nfaltering and blushing, \"I will tell you why I can never be your wife.\r\nI--\" she hesitated, and her head sank upon her bosom, while she stifled\r\na sigh. \"I love another,\" whispered she, almost inarticulately. \"Yes, I\r\nlove another. I love him with every throb of my heart, with all the\r\nstrength of my being. My every breath is a prayer for him. Every wish,\r\nhope, and longing of my soul points to him alone. I would die to give\r\nhim one hour of joy. Now, that I have made this avowal, you retract your\r\nsuit, do you not? You will go now to the empress and say that you will\r\nnot accept me for your wife. You give me my freedom, surely--you give it\r\nto me now.\"\r\n\r\nCount Esterhazy smiled compassionately. \"This is a fable, countess,\r\nwhich you have invented to escape me. A few moments ago you said that\r\nyou would never love.\"\r\n\r\n\"I said that to disincline you to marry me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not believe you,\" said Esterhazy, calmly. \"You have invented this\r\nstory of your love for that end; but it is a falsehood, for you are as\r\ncold as an icicle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I wish that I were. For this love is my greatest misfortune. Look\r\nat me, count. Does this seem like dissimulation?\"\r\n\r\nAnd she raised up to his view a face, scarlet with blushes, and eyes\r\nfilled with burning tears.\r\n\r\n\"No, countess,\" sail Esterbazy, after contemplating her earnestly, \"I\r\nwill believe the tears that glisten in your speaking eyes. But now,\r\nanswer me one question. Your confidence gives me the right to ask it. Is\r\nyour love returned?\"\r\n\r\nShe remained silent, as if communing with herself, while every trace of\r\ncolor vanished from her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said she, at last, with quivering lips. \"No, he does not know it;\r\nand if he did, he could not offer me his hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" replied Esterhazy, coolly, \"your love is no impediment to our\r\nmarriage. Cherish it, if you choose; raise altars to this unknown god,\r\nand deck them with the brightest flowers of devotion. I will not inquire\r\nthe name of your deity. Your secret is safe, even from myself. I, on the\r\ncontrary, have never loved. My heart stands with doors and windows open,\r\nready to receive its mistress; and as the empress has selected you, it\r\nwaits joyfully for you to take possession.\"\r\n\r\nThe countess laid her hand upon his arm, and grasped it like a vise.\r\n\r\n\"You will not recede!\" said she, hoarsely. \"You still persist in\r\ndesiring me for your wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have told me that your love is hopeless, therefore is mine hopeful.\r\nPerhaps one day it may succeed in winning yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you do not love me,\" shrieked the maddened girl. \"You are here by\r\ncommand of the empress.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the Esterhazys have always been the loyal servants of the empress.\r\nWhenever she commands, they obey--were it at the cost of life and\r\nhappiness. Allow me, then, to persevere in my obedience, not only to her\r\ndesires, but to my own. I once more solicit the honor of your hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Woe to you if, after this, I yield!\" cried she, with threatening\r\ngesture. \"I have stooped to entreat you, and my prayers have been vain.\r\nI have withdrawn the womanly veil that concealed my heart's cherished\r\nsecret, and you have not renounced your unmanly suit. I said that I did\r\nnot love you. Look at me, and hear me, while I vow eternal hatred,\r\nshould I be forced to give you my hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is but one step from hate to love. Allow me to hope that you will\r\nthink better of it, and take that step.\"\r\n\r\nA fearful cry rang from her lips, her eyes glowed like burning coals,\r\nand she raised her clinched hand as though she had hoped it might fell\r\nhim to the earth. But suddenly it sank helpless to her side, and she\r\nlooked long and searchingly into Count Esterhazy's face.\r\n\r\nA long silence ensued. \"It is well,\" said she, at length, in clear,\r\nshrill tones. \"You have challenged me to mortal combat, and it may be\r\nthat you will win. But, oh, believe me when I tell you that victory will\r\nbring you no glory! Your strength is not your own; it lies in the\r\nimperial hand of Maria Theresa. I swear to you that if I become your\r\nwife, my whole life shall be consecrated to hatred and revenge. Count\r\nEsterhazy, I hold my word inviolate, whether I pledge it to friend or\r\nfoe; tend when the blight shall fall upon your head that will grow out\r\nof this hour we have spent together, remember that had you been a man of\r\nhonor you might have spared yourself the shame!\"\r\n\r\nWithout another word she lifted her proud head, and, with a look of\r\nwithering scorn, left the room.\r\n\r\nCount Esterhazy's eyes followed her retreating figure, and his placid\r\nbrow grew troubled. \"Beautiful as she is,\" murmured he, \"it is dangerous\r\nto woo her. She has the beauty of Medusa. My heart positively seems to\r\npetrify under her glance. I would be more than willing to renounce the\r\nhonor of wedding this beautiful demon, but I dare not refuse.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he drew out his delicate, embroidered handkerchief to wipe off the\r\nbig drops of sweat that stood upon his forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" asked Count Starhemberg, opening the door and putting through\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n\"Pray come in,\" said Esterhazy, in a piteous tone.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, my niece has left! Well, I suppose that, as usual, she has\r\nconquered, and you release her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" replied the unhappy mannikin; \"I still beg for the honor\r\nof her hand. The empress has spoken, and I have only to obey.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXI.\r\n\r\nFRANZ ANTONY MESMER.\r\n\r\nFor some weeks great excitement had existed in Vienna. In all\r\nassemblies, coffee-houses, and restaurants, in the streets and on the\r\npublic places, the topic of conversation had been the wonderful cures of\r\nthe Suabian physician, Mesmer. These cures contravened all past\r\nexperience, and set at naught all reason. Mesmer made no use of\r\ndecoction or electuary--he prescribed neither baths nor cataplasms; he\r\ncured his patients by the power of his hand and the glance of his large,\r\ndark eye. He breathed upon their foreheads, and forthwith they saw\r\nvisions of far-off lands; he passed the tips of his fingers over their\r\nfaces, and pain and suffering vanished at his touch. No wonder that\r\nphysicians denounced him as a charlatan, and apothecaries reviled him as\r\nan impostor.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that the populace, so prone to believe the marvellous, had\r\nfaith in Mesmer, and reverenced him as a saint. Why should he not\r\nperform miracles with his hand, as did Moses with a rod, when he struck\r\nthe rock? Why should not the power of his eye master disease, as once\r\nthe glance of the Apostles gave speech to the dumb, and awakened life in\r\nthe dead?\r\n\r\nMesmer, too, was an apostle--the apostle of a new faith. He bade\r\nsuffering humanity turn to heaven for relief. \"The reflection from the\r\nplanets,\" said he, \"and the rays of the sun, exercise over the human\r\nsystem a magnetic power. The great remedy for disease lies in this\r\nmagnetic power, which resides in iron and steel, and which has its\r\nhighest and most mysterious development in man.\"\r\n\r\nThe people believed, and sought his healing hand. He mastered their\r\ninfirmities, and soothed their sufferings. But the more the world\r\nhonored and trusted him, the more bitter grew the hatred of the faculty.\r\nEach day brought him fresh blessings and fresh imprecations. The\r\nphysicians, who, in Salzburg, had hurled Paracelsus from a rock, dared\r\nnot attempt the life of Mesmer; but they persecuted him as an impostor,\r\nand proved, by learned and scientific deduction, that his system was a\r\nlying absurdity.\r\n\r\nThose who affected strength of mind, and refused to believe any thing\r\nexcept that which could be demonstrated by process of reasoning, gave in\r\ntheir adherence to the indignant physicians. Those, on the contrary, who\r\nhad faith in the mysteries of religion, were disciples of Mesmer; and\r\nthey reverenced him as a prophet sent from heaven, to prove the\r\nsupremacy of nature over knowledge.\r\n\r\nMesmer's fame had reached the court, and the empress herself became\r\ninterested in his extraordinary achievements. In vain Van Swieten and\r\nStork besought her to silence the audacious quack, who was ruining a\r\ngreat profession. She shook her head, and would have nothing to do with\r\nthe feud.\r\n\r\n\"I shall wait and see,\" said she. \"His system is harmless, and I shall\r\nnot fetter him. One thing is certain. His manipulations will never\r\npoison anybody, as many a regular physician's prescription has done, and\r\nhe shall not be molested. He has voluntarily sought an ordeal which will\r\ndetermine his position before the world. If he cures the blindness of my\r\nlittle protege, Therese, I shall give in my adherence with the rest; for\r\nhe who restores the blind to sight, holds his skill from above.\"\r\n\r\nThis young girl was known to all Vienna. In her second year, after an\r\nattack of suppressed measles, she had become blind, and all attempts to\r\nrestore her sight had proved unavailing. But if sight had been denied to\r\nher eyes, her soul was lit up by the inspiration of art. When Therese\r\nsat before the harpsichord and her dexterous fingers wandered over its\r\nkeys--when, with undisturbed serenity, she executed the most difficult\r\nmusic that could be written for the instrument, no one who saw her\r\nbeautiful eyes could have surmised their inutility. Her features were\r\nexpressive, and those sightless eyes apemed at times to brighten with\r\njoy, or to grow dim with sorrow. Nevertheless, Therese von Paradies was\r\nwholly blind; her eyes were merely the portals of her soul--they sent\r\nforth light, but received none in return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXII.\r\n\r\nTHERESE VON PARADIES.\r\n\r\nTherese von Paradies was in her room; her mother stood near, for, with\r\nthe assistance of a maid, she had just completed her daughter's toilet.\r\nTherese was elegantly dressed, and she seemed to enjoy her splendor\r\nalthough she was not permitted to see it.\r\n\r\n\"Say, mother,\" said she, as the last touch had been given to her dress,\r\n\"of what material is my gown? It feels as soft as a young girl's cheek.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is satin, my child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Satin? And the color?\"\r\n\r\n\"White.\"\r\n\r\n\"White!\" repeated she, softly. \"The color without color. How strange\r\nthat must be! I shudder when I think that I shall see it before long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should you shudder?\" said her mother, tenderly. \"You should\r\nrejoice, dear child, that the world, with all its beauties, is about to\r\nbecome known to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" replied Therese, thoughtfully. \"I shall enter upon a\r\nnew world which will astonish and perchance affright me by its\r\nstrangeness. Now I know you all in my heart, but when I see you I shall\r\nno longer recognize you. Oh, mother, why do you wish me to be restored\r\nto sight? I am very happy as I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Silly child, you will be still happier when you see. It is absurd for\r\nyou to dread an event which will add a hundredfold to your enjoyment of\r\nlife.\"'\r\n\r\n\"And why absurd, dear mother? Does not the heart of the bride, on her\r\nwedding-day, beat half in hope and half in fear? And is not her soul\r\nfilled with sweet apprehension? I am a bride--the bride of light--and I\r\nawait my lover to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, who knows if light will come?\" sighed the mother.\r\n\r\n\"It will come, mother,\" said Therese, confidently. \"I felt it yesterday,\r\nwhen, for a moment, Mesmer removed the bandage from my eyes. It was for\r\na second, but I SAW, and what I saw cut like a sharp sword athwart my\r\neyes, and I fell, almost unconscious.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was a ray of light---the first glance of your bridegroom!\" cried\r\nthe mother, joyfully.\r\n\r\n\"Then I fear that I shall never be able to bear his presence,\" replied\r\nTherese, sadly. \"But tell me, mother, am I dressed as becomes a bride?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Therese, you are beautifully dressed; for to-day we receive a\r\nthrong of distinguished guests. The empress herself has sent one of her\r\nlords in waiting, to bear her the tidings of your restoration to sight.\r\nThe two great doctors, Van Swieten and Stork, will be here to see the\r\nmarvel; and princes and princesses, lords and ladies, ministers and\r\ngenerals, will be around you.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is my hair dressed?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is dressed as you like it, a la Matignon. Pepi has built a tower\r\nupon your head at least three quarters of an ell high, and above that is\r\na blue rosette, with long ends.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is indeed very high,\" replied Therese, laughing, \"for I cannot reach\r\nit with my hands. But I have another question to ask, dear mother.\r\nPromise me that it shall be frankly answered.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, tell me, is my appearance pleasing? Hitherto every one has\r\nbeen kind to me because of my misfortune; but when I stand upon equal\r\nfooting with other women, do you think that I am pretty enough to give\r\npleasure to my friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dear, you are very handsome,\" said the mother, smiling\r\nlovingly at her child's simplicity. \"Your figure is graceful, your face\r\nis oval, your features are regular, and your brow is high and\r\nthoughtful. When the light of day shall be reflected from your large,\r\ndark eyes, you will be a beautiful woman, my daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, dear mother, these are pleasant tidings,\" said Therese,\r\nkissing her.\r\n\r\n\"I must leave you, dearest,\" said her mother, softly disengaging herself\r\nfrom Therese's arms. \"I have my own toilet to make, and some preparations\r\nfor our guests. I will send the maid.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, dear mother, send no one. I need silence and solitude. I, too, have\r\npreparations to make for the heavenly guest that visits me to-day. I\r\nmust strengthen my soul by prayer.\"\r\n\r\nShe accompanied her mother to the door, kissed her again, and returning,\r\nseated herself at the harpsichord. And now from its keys came forth\r\nsounds of mirth and melancholy, of love and complaint, of prayers and\r\ntear. At one time she intoned a hymn of joy; then came stealing over the\r\nair a melody that brought tears to the eyes of the musician; then it\r\nchanged and swelled into a torrent of gushing harmony.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she paused, a tremor ran through her frame, and a blush slowly\r\nmantled her cheek. Her hands fell, and her bosom heaved. As if drawn by\r\nsome invisible power, she rose from her instrument and went toward the\r\ndoor. In the centre of the room she stopped and pressed her hands upon\r\nher heart.\r\n\r\n\"He comes,\" murmured she, with a smile of ecstasy, \"he mounts the\r\nstaircase, now he is in the corridor, his hand is upon the door.\"\r\n\r\nYes; the door opened so softly that the acutest ear could not have\r\ndetected a sound. But Therese felt it, and she would have gone forward,\r\nbut her feet were paralyzed, and she remained with outstretched arms.\r\nWith her heart she had seen him who now appeared upon the threshold. The\r\nperson, whose coming had so agitated the young girl, was a man of\r\nscarcely forty years, of a lofty imposing carriage, and of prepossessing\r\nfeatures. His large, blue eyes rested upon Therese with a glance of\r\npower, which thrilled through every fibre of her being. He held out his\r\nright arm toward her; then slowly lowering it, he pointed to the floor.\r\nTherese followed its motion and sank on her knees. A triumphant smile\r\nbeamed over Mesmer's face, and he raised his hand again. The girl arose,\r\nand as though she had seen him open his arms, she darted forward and\r\nlaid her head upon his breast.\r\n\r\n\"Mesmer, my friend, my physician,\" whispered she, softly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is I,\" replied Mesmer, in a rich, melodious voice. \"Your heart\r\nhas seen me, your eyes shall see me too, my child.\"\r\n\r\nHe led her to a sofa and seated her gently beside him. Then passing his\r\noutstretched band before her, she trembled.\r\n\r\n\"You are very much excited to-day, Therese,\" said he, with a slight tone\r\nof disapprobation.\r\n\r\n\"I am excited because you are so, dear friend,\" said the blind girl.\r\n\"Your eyes dart beams that threaten to consume the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"A world of ignorance and of wickedness,\" said he, in reply. \"Yes,\r\nTherese, I will consume it to-day, and in its stead shall arise a\r\nsupernatural world; yet one to which banished Nature shall return and\r\nclaim her rights to man. Oh, will I have strength to say, 'Let there be\r\nlight!\"'\r\n\r\n\"Dear friend, if you doubt the result, do not expose yourself to the\r\nhumiliation of failure. I am satisfied with my blindness, for I have a\r\nworld of light in my heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" cried Mesmer, with energy, \"the work is begun, it must be\r\ncompleted. You MUST see, Therese, or all for which I have striven will\r\nrecoil upon my head, and bury me beneath its ruins. This day decides not\r\nonly your fate, poor child, but mine. To-day must Mesmer prove to the\r\nworld that the animal magnetism, which physicians deride as a quackery,\r\nsavans deny as impracticable, and the people ignorantly worship as\r\nsorcery, is a golden link which binds humanity to heaven. To-day you\r\nshall be healed by the magnetic power which binds you to me, and links\r\nus both to God.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heal me then, dear master!\" cried the girl, inspired by his enthusiasm.\r\n\"Restore me to sight, and, in so doing, give light to those who cannot\r\nsee your Godlike gift.\"\r\n\r\nHe laid his hand upon her shoulder, and gazed earnestly in her face.\r\n\"You have faith in me then, Theresa, have you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe in you, and I comprehend you, master. I know that I shall\r\nsee; and when the scales fall from my eyes, the light of conviction will\r\ndawn for others. They will then comprehend that there is a power in\r\nNature stronger than the craft of bare human wisdom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you speak my very thoughts, dear Therese,\" said Mesmer, tenderly.\r\n\"You see into my mind, and its perceptions find birth upon your lips.\r\nLet doctors sneer, and learned skeptics disbelieve, but the day will\r\ncome when all must acknowledge that magnetism is truth, and all human\r\nwisdom lies. Physicians, though, will be its deadliest enemies, for they\r\nare travellers, who, having strayed from the right path, go farther and\r\nfarther from truth, because they will not retrace their steps.\"\r\n[Footnote: Mesmer's own words. See \"Franz Anton Mesmer, of Suabia,\" by\r\nDr. Justinus Kerner. p. 58.]\r\n\r\n\"But you will show them the path, my master, and the world will honor\r\nyou above other men.\"\r\n\r\n\"If ingratitude do not blind it to truth. It is hard to find daylight in\r\nthe labyrinth of established faith. I, too, have wandered in this\r\nlabyrinth, but in all my divarications I sought for Truth. With\r\npassionate longing I called her to my help. Far removed from the hum of\r\nhuman imbecility, down among the solitudes of untrodden forests I sought\r\nher. Here I was face to face with Nature, and listened for response to\r\nthe anxious questionings of my restless heart. It was well for me that\r\nthe trees were the only witnesses of my agitation, for my fellow-men,\r\nhad they met, would have chained me as a madman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I, master. I would have understood your noble strife.\"\r\n\r\nMesmer pressed her hand and went on: \"Every occupation became\r\ndistasteful to me, every moment dedicated to aught else seemed to be\r\ntreason to truth. I regretted the time which it cost me to translate my\r\nthoughts into words, and I formed the singular resolution of keeping\r\nsilence. For three months I reflected without speaking a word. At the\r\nend of this time a new faculty unfolded itself in my mind, and I began\r\nto see with rapture that the day of truth had dawned. I knew that\r\nhenceforth my life would be one long struggle against preconceived\r\nerror; but this did not affright me. So much the more did I feel the\r\nobligation resting upon me to impart to my fellow-beings the gifts I had\r\nreceived. I have suffered much from their prejudices; but most from the\r\nsneers of envious physicians, who, sooner than receive a light from\r\nother hands, would stumble in the night of their ignorance forever.\r\n[Footnote: This whole conversation is in Mesmer's words. See Justinus\r\nKerner, p. 60.] But my day of triumph is here. You, Therese, are the\r\nevangelist of my new faith, and your restored vision shall announce it\r\nto the world!\"\r\n\r\n\"It shall, dear master, it shall; and against their will these infidels\r\nshall believe. They will see that we have all been blind together--all\r\nbut you, who, questioning in faith, have received your answer from on\r\nhigh. Take the bandage from my eyes and let me see the light of day! I\r\ntremble no longer with apprehension of its splendor!\"\r\n\r\nMesmer held her back as she raised her hands to her head. \"Not yet,\r\nTherese. Your bandage must be removed in the presence of my enemies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whom do you expect, master?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have told you--I expect my enemies. Professor Barth will be there to\r\nsneer at the charlatan who, by an invisible power, has healed the malady\r\nwhich his couching knife would have sought in vain to remove. Doctor\r\nIngenhaus, my bitter rival, will be there, to find out by what infernal\r\nmagic the charlatan has cured hundreds of patients pronounced by him\r\nincurable. Father Hell will be there, to see if the presence of a great\r\nastronomer will not affright the charlatan. Oh, yes!--And others will be\r\nthere--none seeking knowledge, but all hoping to see me discomfited.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not call yourself so often by that unworthy name,\" said Therese\r\nsorrowfully.\r\n\r\n\"Men call me so; I may as well accept the title.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps they have called you so in days gone by; but from this day they\r\nwill call you 'Master,' and will crave your pardon for the obloquy they\r\nhave heaped upon your noble head.\"\r\n\r\n\"How little you know of the world, Therese! It never pardons those who\r\nconvict it of error; and above all other hatred is the hatred that\r\nmankind feel for their benefactors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gracious Heaven, master, if this is the world which is to open to my\r\nview, in mercy leave me to my blindness!\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped suddenly, and sank back upon the cushion of the sofa. Mesmer\r\nraised his hands and passed them before her forehead.\r\n\r\n\"You are too much excited. Sleep!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, I do not wish to sleep,\" murmured she.\r\n\r\n\"I command you to sleep,\" repeated Mesmer.\r\n\r\nTherese heaved a sigh; her head fell farther back, and her audible,\r\nregular breathing soon proved that sleep had come at the bidding of her\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nMesmer bent over her, and began his manipulations. He approached her\r\nlips, and opening her mouth, breathed into it. She smiled a happy smile.\r\nHe then raised his hands and touching the crown of her head described\r\nhalf-circles in the air; then stooping over her, he again inhaled her\r\nbreath, and breathed his own into her mouth.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and the mother of Therese came in.\r\n\r\n\"The guests are here,\" said she.\r\n\r\nMesmer inclined his head. \"We are ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ready and Therese sleeps so soundly?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will awake her when it is time. Where is my harmonicon?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the parlor, where you ordered it to be placed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us go, then, and thence we will call Therese. \"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST DAY OF LIGHT.\r\n\r\nThe elite of Vienna were assembled in the drawing-room of Herr von\r\nParadies. The aristocratic, the scientific, and the artistic world were\r\nrepresented; and the empress, as before intimated, had sent her\r\nmessenger to take notes of the extraordinary experiment which was that\r\nday to be tried upon the person of her young pensioner. At the request\r\nof Mesmer, some of the lower classes were there also, for it was his\r\ndesire that the cottage as well as the palace should bear testimony to\r\nthe triumph of animal magnetism over the prejudices of conventional\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nBy order of Mesmer, the room had been darkened, and heavy green curtains\r\nhung before every window. Seats were arranged around the room, in the\r\ncentre of which was a space occupied by a couch, some chairs, and a\r\ntable on which lay a box.\r\n\r\nUpon this box the eyes of the spectators were riveted; and Professor\r\nBarth himself, in spite of his arrogant bearing, felt quite as much\r\ncuriosity as his neighbors, to see its contents.\r\n\r\n\"You will see, Herr Kollege,\" said he to one who sat beside him, \"you\r\nwill see that he merely wishes to collect this brilliant assemblage in\r\norder to perform an operation in their presence, and so make a name for\r\nhimself. This box of course contains the instruments. Wait and watch for\r\nthe lancet that first or last is sure to make its appearance.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will be the use of his lancet,\" replied Herr Kollege, \"when there\r\nis nothing upon which it can operate? The girl is irretrievably blind;\r\nfor neither knife nor lancet can restore life to the deadened optical\r\nnerve.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he attempts to use the lancet in MY presence,\" said the professor in\r\na threatening tone, \"I will prevent him. I shall watch him closely, and\r\nwoe to the impostor if I surprise him at a trick!\"\r\n\r\n\"The box does not contain surgical instruments,\" whispered the\r\nastronomer Hell. \"I know what he has in there.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" asked the others eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"A planet, my friends. You know be is given to meddling with planets. I\r\nhope it is one unknown to science; for if he has carried off any of MY\r\nstars, I shall have him arrested for robbery.\"\r\n\r\nThis sally caused much laughter, which was interrupted by the entrance\r\nof Mesmer with Frau von Paradies. Without seeming to observe the\r\nspectators who now thronged the room, Mesmer advanced to the table where\r\nlay the box. His face was pale, but perfectly resolute; and as his eyes\r\nwere raised to meet those of the guests, each one felt that whatever\r\nmight be the result, in the soul of the operator there was neither doubt\r\nnor fear.\r\n\r\nMesmer opened the box. A breathless silence greeted this act. Every\r\nwhisper was hushed, every straining glance was fixed upon that\r\nmysterious coffer. He seated himself before it, and Professor Barth\r\nwhispered, \"Now he is about to take out his instruments.\"\r\n\r\nBut he was interrupted by the sound of music--music so exquisite that\r\nthe heart of the learned professor himself responded to its pathos. It\r\nswelled and swelled until it penetrated the room and filled all space\r\nwith its thrilling notes. All present felt its power, and every eye was\r\nfixed upon the enchanter, who was swaying a multitude as though their\r\nemotions had been his slaves, and his music the voice that bade them\r\nlive or die.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" whispered the astronomer, \"you made a mistake of a part of speech.\r\nThe man has not instruments, but AN instrument.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" replied the professor, \"and your planet turns out to be an\r\ninsignificant harmonicon.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the lancet,\" added Inaenhaus, \"is a cork, with a whale-bone\r\nhandle.\"\r\n\r\nMesmer played on, and now his music seemed an entreaty to some invisible\r\nspirit to appear and reveal itself to mortal eyes. At least, so it\r\nsounded to the ears of his listeners. They started--for responsive to\r\nthe call, a tall white figure, whose feet seemed scarcely to touch the\r\nfloor, glided in and stood for a moment irresolute. Mesmer raised his\r\nhand and stretching it out toward her, she moved. Still he played on,\r\nand nearer and nearer she came, while the music grew louder and more\r\nirresistible in its pleadings.\r\n\r\nA movement was perceptible among the spectators. Several ladies had\r\nfainted; their nerves had given way before the might of that wonderful\r\nmusic.[Footnote: It frequently happened that not only women, but men\r\nalso, fainted, when Mesmer played on the glass-harmonicon. Justinus\r\nKerner, p. 41.] But no one felt disposed to move to assist them, for all\r\nwere absorbed by the spell, and each one gazed in speechless expectation\r\nupon Mesmer and Therese.\r\n\r\nHe still played on, but he threw up his head, and his large eyes were\r\ndirected toward his patient with a look of authority. She felt the\r\nglance and trembled. Then she hastened her steps, and smilingly advanced\r\nuntil she stood close beside the table. He pointed to the couch, and she\r\nimmediately turned toward it and sat down.\r\n\r\n\"This is well gotten up,\" said Professor Barth. \"The scene must have\r\nbeen rehearsed more than once.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the blind are to be restored to sight by harmonicons,\" whispered\r\nDoctor Ingenhaus, \"I shall throw my books to the winds, and become an\r\nitinerant musician.\"\r\n\r\n\"If planets are to be brought down by a wave of the hand,\" said Hell, \"I\r\nwill break all my telescopes, and offer my services to Mesmer as an\r\namanuensis.\"\r\n\r\nThe harmonicon ceased, and the censorious professors were forced to stop\r\ntheir cavilling.\r\n\r\nMesmer arose, and, approaching Therese, made a few passes above her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\"My eyes burn as if they were pierced with red-hot daggers,\" said she,\r\nwith an expression of great suffering.\r\n\r\nHe now directed the tips of his fingers toward her eyes, and touched the\r\nbandage.\r\n\r\n\"Remove the bandage, and see!\" cried he in a loud voice.\r\n\r\nTherese tore it off, and pale as death she gazed with wonder at the\r\n\"Master,\" who stood directly in front of her. Pointing to him, she said\r\nwith an expression of fear and dislike:\r\n\r\n\"Is that a man which stands before me?\" [Footnote: Therese's own words.\r\nJustinus Kerner, p. 63.]\r\n\r\nMesmer bowed his head. Therese started back, exclaiming, \"It is fearful!\r\nBut where is Mesmer? Show me Mesmer!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am he,\" said Mesmer, approaching her.\r\n\r\nShe drew back and looked at him with a scrutinizing expression.\r\n\r\n\"I had supposed that the human face was radiant with joy,\" said she,\r\n\"but this one looks like incarnate woe. Are all mankind sad? Where is my\r\nmother?\"\r\n\r\nFrau von Paradies was awaiting her daughter's call; she now came\r\nforward, her face beaming with love and joy. But Therese, instead of\r\nmeeting her with equal fervor, shrank, and covered her face with her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\"Therese, my daughter, look upon me,\" said the mother.\r\n\r\n\"It is her voice,\" cried Therese, joyfully, removing her hands. Frau von\r\nParadies stood by, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Is this my mother?\" continued she, looking up into her face. \"Yes--it\r\nmust be so; those tearful eyes are full of love. Oh, mother, come\r\nnearer, and let me look into those loving eyes!\"\r\n\r\nHer mother leaned over her, but again Therese recoiled. \"What a frightful\r\nthing!\" said she, with a look of fear.\r\n\r\n\"What, Therese? What is frightful?\" asked her mother.\r\n\r\n\"Look at your mother, Therese,\" said Mesmer. She heard the well-beloved\r\nvoice, and her hands fell from her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Now tell me, what disturbs you,\" said Frau von Paradies.\r\n\r\nTherese raised her hand and pointed to her mother's nose. \"It is that,\"\r\nsaid she. \"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is my nose!\" exclaimed her mother, laughing, and her laugh was\r\nechoed throughout the room.\r\n\r\n\"This nose on the human face is horrible,\" said Therese. \"It threatens\r\nme as though it would stab my eyes.\" [Footnote: These are the exact\r\nwords of Therese. Justinus Kerner, p 68.]\r\n\r\n\"I will show you the figure of a man who threatens,\" said Mesmer,\r\nassuming an angry air, clinching his fists, and advancing a few paces.\r\n\r\nTherese fell upon her knees with a cry. \"You will kill me!\" exclaimed\r\nshe, cowering to the floor.\r\n\r\nThe spectators were thunderstruck. Even Professor Barth yielded to the\r\noverwhelming evidence of his senses.\r\n\r\n\"By Heaven, it is no deception!\" exclaimed he. \"She sees!\"\r\n\r\n\"Since Professor Barth is convinced, no one will dare dispute the fact,\"\r\nobserved Mesmer, loud enough to be overheard by the professor.\r\n\r\nBarth frowned, and pretended not to hear. He already repented of what he\r\nhad said, and would have bought back his own words with a handful of\r\nducats. But it was too late. Every one had heard him, and on every side\r\nmurmurs of astonishment and of admiration grew into distinct applause.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Therese was greeting her father and her other relatives. But\r\nshe, who had always been so affectionate, was now embarrassed and cold.\r\n\r\n\"I knew it,\" said she, sadly. \"I knew that the gift of sight would not\r\nincrease my happiness. Imagination had drawn your images, and I loved\r\nthe pictures she had painted. But now that I see you with the eyes of\r\nflesh, my heart recoils from participation in the sad secrets which your\r\ncareworn faces reveal. Ah, I believe that love, in its highest sense, is\r\nknown to the blind alone! But where is Bello? Let me see my dog, the\r\nfaithful companion of my days of dependence.\"\r\n\r\nBello had been whining at the door, and as Frau von Paradies opened it,\r\nhe bounded to his mistress, caressing her with his paws, and licking her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nTherese bent over him, and the dog raised his eyes to hers. She stroked\r\nhis glossy, black coat and; for the first time since she had recovered\r\nher sight, she smiled.\r\n\r\n\"This dog is more pleasing to me than man,\" said she, communing with\r\nherself. \"There is truth in his eyes, and his face does not terrify me,\r\nlike those of my own race.\" [Footnote: Therese's own words. Justinus\r\nKerner, p. 63.]\r\n\r\n\"I think we may take our leave,\" growled Professor Barth, \"the comedy is\r\nover, and the relations and friends can applaud the author and the\r\nactress. I don't feel it my duty to remain for that purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I,\" added Doctor Ingenhaus, as he prepared to accompany the\r\nprofessor. \"My head is in a whirl with the antics of this devilish\r\ndoctor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take me with you,\" said Father Hell. \"I must go and look after my\r\nplanets. I'm afraid we shall miss another Pleiad.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the representatives of science took their leave. At the door\r\nthey met Count von Langermann, the messenger of the empress.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, gentlemen,\" said he, \"you are hastening from this enchanted spot to\r\nannounce its wonders to the world. No one will venture to doubt, when\r\nsuch learned professors have seen and believed. I myself am on my way to\r\napprise the empress of Mesmer's success.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray inform the empress, also, that we have seen an admirable comedy,\r\ncount,\" said Barth, with a sneer.\r\n\r\n\"A comedy!\" echoed the count. \"It is a marvellous reality. Yourself\r\nconfessed it, professor.\"\r\n\r\n\"A careless word, prematurely uttered, is not to be accepted as\r\nevidence,\" growled Barth.\r\n\r\n\"Such astounding things demand time for consideration. They may be\r\noptical delusions,\" added Ingenhaus.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, gentlemen, the fact is a stubborn one,\" laughed Count Langermann.\r\n\"Therese von Paradies has recovered her sight without couching-knife or\r\nlancet, and I shall certainly convey the news of the miracle to the\r\nempress.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do?\" asked the astronomer of his compeers, as Count\r\nLangermann bowed and left them.\r\n\r\nProfessor Barth answered nothing.\r\n\r\n\"We must devise something to prop up science, or she will fall upon our\r\nheads and crush us to death,\" said Ingenhaus.\r\n\r\n\"What are we to do?\" repeated Barth, slowly, as after an embarrassing\r\nsilence, the three had walked some distance together down the street. \"I\r\nwill tell you what we must do. Treat the whole thing as a farce, and\r\nmaintain, in the face of all opposition, that Therese von Paradies is\r\nstill blind.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my honored friend, unhappily for us all, you have made this\r\nimpracticable by your awkward enthusiasm.\"\r\n\r\n\"I spoke ironically, and the ass mistook sarcasm for conviction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and so did everybody else.\" sighed Hell. \"You will find it\r\ndifficult to convince the world that you were not in earnest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps today and tomorrow I may fail to convince the world, but the\r\nday after it will begin to reason and to doubt. If we do not oppose this\r\nquack with a strong phalanx of learned men, we shall be sneered at for\r\nour previous incredulity. Now I adhere to my text. Therese von Paradies\r\nis blind, and no one shall prove to me that she can see. Come to my\r\nstudy, and let us talk this provoking matter over.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Therese was receiving the congratulations of her friends. She\r\ngazed at their unknown faces with a melancholy smile, and frowned when\r\nit was said to her, \"This is the friend whom you love so much\"--\"This is\r\nthe relative whose society has always been so agreeable to you.\"\r\n\r\nThen she closed her eyes, and said they were weary. \"Let me hear your\r\nvoices, and so accustom myself to your strange countenances,\" said she.\r\n\"Speak, dear friends; I would rather know you with the heart than with\r\nthese deceiving eyes.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as one of her female companions came up to greet her, Therese\r\nburst into a merry laugh. \"What absurd thing is that growing out of your\r\nhead?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"Why, that is the coiffure, which you like the best,\" replied her\r\nmother. \"It is a coiffure a la Matignon.\"\r\n\r\nTherese raised her hands to her own head. \"True, the very same towering\r\nabsurdity. I never will wear it again, mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very fashionable, and you will become accustomed to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I shall never be reconciled to such a caricature. Now that I can\r\nchoose for myself, I shall attend less to fashion than to fitness in my\r\ndress. But I have seen mankind--let me see nature and heaven. Mesmer,\r\nmay I look upon the skies?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, my child, and we will try if your eyes can bear the full light of\r\nday,\" replied Mesmer, fondly, and taking her arm he led her toward the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nBut Therese, usually so firm in her tread, took short, uncertain steps,\r\nand seemed afraid to advance.\r\n\r\n\"Gracious Heaven!\" exclaimed she, clinging anxiously to Mesmer, \"see how\r\nthe windows come toward us! We shall be crushed to death!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Therese; it is we who advance, not they. You will soon acquire a\r\npractical knowledge of the laws of optics, and learn to calculate\r\ndistances and sizes as well as the rest of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is this?\" cried she, as they approached the tall mirror that\r\nwas placed between the windows.\r\n\r\n\"That is a mirror.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is that man who is so like yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is only the reflection of my person in the mirror.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is that ridiculous being with the coiffure a la Matignon?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I!\" exclaimed she, quickly advancing to the mirror. But suddenly she\r\nretreated in alarm. \"Gracious Heaven! it comes so fast that it will\r\nthrow me down. \"Then she stopped for a moment and laughed. \"See,\" said\r\nshe, \"the girl is as cowardly as myself. The farther I step back the\r\nfarther she retreats also.\"\r\n\r\n\"All this is an optical delusion, Therese. The girl is nothing but a\r\nreflection, a picture of yourself in the mirror.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, I forgot. You told me that just now,\" replied Therese, drawing\r\nher hand wearily across her forehead. \"Well, let me contemplate myself.\r\nThis, then, is my likeness,\" said she, musing. \"My mother was mistaken.\r\nThis face is not handsome. It is weary and soulless. Come, master, I\r\nhave enough of it--let me see the heavens.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait until I draw the curtain to see whether you are able to bear the\r\nfull light of day.\"\r\n\r\nThe curtain was lifted, and Therese, giving a scream, hid her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it cuts like the point of a dagger!\" cried she.\r\n\r\n\"I thought so; you will have to become gradually accustomed to it. You\r\nshall see the sky this evening. But now you must suffer me to bind up\r\nyour eyes, for they must have rest.\" [Footnote: The description of\r\nTherese's impressions, and the words she used upon the recovery of her\r\nsight, are not imaginary. They are all cited by Justinus Kerner, and\r\nwere related to him by her own father.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIV.\r\n\r\nDIPLOMATIC STRATEGY.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Joseph was in his cabinet, engaged in looking over the\r\nletters and documents of the day, when a page announced his highness\r\nPrince Kaunitz. Joseph waved his hand in token of consent, and when the\r\nprince appeared at the door, rose to meet him as he entered the room.\r\n\r\n\"It must be business of state that brings your highness to my study at\r\nthis early hour,\" said the emperor.\r\n\r\n\"It is indeed, sire,\" said Kaunitz, taking the chair which Joseph\r\nhimself had just placed for him.\r\n\r\n\"And it must be a day of rejoicing with you, prince, for I see that you\r\nwear every order with which you have been decorated by every court in\r\nEurope. What does this display signify?\"\r\n\r\n\"It signifies, sire, that the day has come, which I have awaited for\r\ntwenty years, the day for which I have schemed and toiled, and which for\r\nme shall be the proudest day of my life. I go out to battle, and if I am\r\nto be victorious, your majesty must come to my assistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it a duel with the empress, in which I am to be your second? I thank\r\nyou for the honor, but you know that I have no influence with my lady\r\nmother. I am an emperor without a sceptre. But tell me Kaunitz, what is\r\nthe cause of the trouble?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know it, sire, and I have come to prove to you that I am a man of\r\nmy word, and keep my promises.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not remember that you ever promised me any thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I do. I remember a day on which my young emperor came to me to\r\ncomplain of a wrong which had been inflicted upon him at court.\"\r\n\r\n\"Marianne!\" exclaimed the emperor, with a sigh. \"Yes, yes, the day on\r\nwhich I lost sight of her forever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire. The emperor, worthy of his high vocation, relinquished the\r\ngirl who had found favor in his eyes, and for this sacrifice I promised\r\nhim my loyal friendship. Three objects formed the ties that bound us\r\ntogether on that day. Does your majesty remember?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. You promised to place Austria at the head of European affairs; you\r\nhave done so. You promised indemnity for Silesia; we have it in our\r\nrecent acquisitions in Poland.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promised also to crush the priesthood, and to ruin the Jesuits,\"\r\ncried Kaunitz, exultingly, \"and I am here to fulfil my promise. The hour\r\nhas come; for I am on my way to obtain the consent of the empress to the\r\nbanishment of the Jesuits from Austria.\"\r\n\r\n\"You never will obtain it. Attachment to the Order of Jesus is an\r\ninheritance with the house of Hapsburg; and my mother styles me a\r\ndegenerate son because I do not participate in the feeling.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will find means to alienate the empress,\" said Kaunitz, quietly.\r\n\r\n\"I hope so, but I doubt it. Tell me what I am to do, and I am ready to\r\nmake another charge against them.\"\r\n\r\nPrince Kaunitz opened his pocket-book, and took thence a letter which he\r\nhanded to the emperor.\r\n\r\n\"Will your majesty have the goodness to hand this to the empress? It is\r\na letter from Carlos III., in which he earnestly requests his\r\nillustrious kinswoman to give protection no longer to the Jesuits, whom\r\nhe has driven from Spain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed?\" said the emperor, smiling. \"If that is all, the Spanish\r\nambassador might have delivered it quite as well as I.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sire, that is not all. It was the King of Spain's request that your\r\nmajesty should deliver the letter, and sustain it by every argument\r\nwhich your well-known enmity to the Jesuits might suggest.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am more than willing to undertake it; but to-day, as ever, my\r\nrepresentations to the empress will be vain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do your best, sire, and I will come to your relief with a reserved\r\nforce, which will do good service. Only allow me to request that you\r\nwill not quit the empress until the reserve comes up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the parts we are to play are distributed and learned by heart?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so; and Heaven be propitious, that the scenery may work well, and\r\nthe actors may know their cue!\"\r\n\r\n\"We have accomplices, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be accompanied by the papal nuncio, and if your majesty permits\r\nme, I will go for him at once. In half an hour I shall come to the\r\nrescue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go, then, and I fly to the empress,\" cried Joseph, with exultation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXV.\r\n\r\nDOMINUS AC REDEMPTOR NOSTER.\r\n\r\nTrue to their agreement, the emperor sought an interview with his\r\nmother. Not enjoying, like her prime minister, the privilege of entering\r\nthe empress's presence without formal leave, Joseph was always obliged\r\nto wait in her anteroom until the chamberlain returned with her\r\nmajesty's answer. To-day the empress was propitious, and gave word for\r\nher son to be admitted to her private cabinet at once. That he might\r\nenter promptly upon the object of his visit, the emperor opened the\r\ninterview by handing the letter of the King of Spain, and requesting her\r\nmajesty to read it in his presence.\r\n\r\nThe empress, surprised at the urgency of the demand, sat before her\r\nescritoire and read the missive of her royal relative; while her son,\r\nwith folded arms, stood near a window, and scrutinized her countenance.\r\n\r\nHe saw how gradually her expression lowered, until heavy folds\r\ncorrugated her brow, and deep heavings agitated her chest.\r\n\r\n\"Those are the sea-gulls that announce the coming storm,\" said he, to\r\nhimself. \"I must be on my guard lest I be engulfed in the foaming\r\nwaves.\"\r\n\r\nAs if she had guessed his thoughts, Maria Theresa raised her eyes from\r\nthe letter, and darted a look of displeasure at her son.\r\n\r\n\"Is the emperor aware of the contents of this letter?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"I believe so, your majesty,\" replied he, coming forward and bowing. \"It\r\nis an urgent request on the part of the King of Spain to have the\r\nJesuits removed from Austria.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing less,\" cried the empress, indignantly. \"He expects me to assume\r\nall his enmity toward the Jesuits, and urges it in a most unseemly\r\nmanner. Doubtless, he requested your majesty to present his letter in\r\nperson, because it is well known, that in this, as in all other things,\r\nyour opinions are at variance with those of your mother. I presume this\r\nis a new tilt against my predilections, like that in which you overthrew\r\nme but a few weeks since, when I signed the act that ruined Poland.\r\nSpeak out. Are you not here to sustain the King of Spain?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am, your majesty,\" cried Joseph, reddening. \"I would do as the King\r\nof Spain has done. I would importune you until the power of the Jesuits\r\nis crushed in Austria, as it has been crushed in France and in Spain.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will not succeed!\" cried the empress, trying to control her rising\r\nanger. \"I make no protest against the action of the kings of France,\r\nSpain, or Portugal, for I presume that they have decided according to\r\ntheir convictions; but in Austria the Jesuits deserve all praise for\r\ntheir enlightened piety, and their existence is so essential to the\r\nwell-being of the people, that I shall sustain and protect them as long\r\nas I live.\" [Footnote: Peter Philip Wolf, \"General History of the\r\nJesuits,\" vol. iv., p. 53.]\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" cried Joseph, passionately, \"Austria is lost. If I were capable\r\nof hate, I should hate these Jesuits, who, propagating the senile\r\nvagaries of an old Spanish dotard, have sought to govern the souls of\r\nmen, and have striven for nothing on earth or in heaven save the\r\nextension of their own influence and authority.\"\r\n\r\n\"It appears to me that my son has no reason to lament the softness of\r\nhis own heart,\" replied Maria Theresa, bitterly. \"If he were absolute\r\nsovereign here, the Jesuits would be exiled to-morrow; and the King of\r\nPrussia, for whom he entertains such unbounded admiration, would be the\r\nfirst one to offer them shelter. I will answer your vituperation, my\r\nson, by reading to you a letter written by Frederick to his agent in\r\nRome. It relates to the rumor now afloat that the pope is about to\r\ndisperse the holy brotherhood. I have just received a copy of it from\r\nItaly, and it rejoices me to be able to lay it before you. Hear your\r\ndemi-god.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress took a paper from her escritoire, and unfolding it, read\r\naloud:\r\n\r\n\"Announce distinctly, but without bravado, that as regards the Jesuits,\r\nI am resolved to uphold them for the future, as I have done hitherto.\r\nSeek a fitting opportunity to communicate my sentiments on the subject\r\nto the pope. I have guaranteed free exercise of religion to my subjects\r\nin Silesia. I have never known a priesthood worthier of esteem than the\r\nJesuits. Add to this, that as I am an infidel, the pope cannot dispense\r\nme from the obligation of performing my duty as an honorable man and an\r\nupright sovereign. \"FREDERICK.\" [Footnote: Peter Philip Wolf, \"General\r\nHistory of the Jesuits,\" vol. iv., p. 53.]\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" asked the empress, as she folded the letter, \"shall the infidel\r\nshame the Christian? Would you seriously ask of me to be less clement to\r\nthe priesthood than a Protestant prince? Never, never shall it be said\r\nthat Maria Theresa was ungrateful to the noble brotherhood who are the\r\nbulwarks of order and of legitimate authority.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph was about to snake an angry retort, when the door opened and a\r\npage announced, with great formality:\r\n\r\n\"His highness Prince Kaunitz, and his eminence the papal nuncio,\r\nMonsignore Garampi.\"\r\n\r\nThe two ministers followed close upon the announcement, and the nuncio\r\nwas received by the empress with a beaming smile.\r\n\r\n\"I am curious to know what has brought Prince Kaunitz and the papal\r\nnuncio together,\" said she. \"It is unusual to see the prime minister of\r\nAustria in the company of churchmen. It must, therefore, be something\r\nsignificant which has united church and state to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty is right,\" replied Kaunitz, \"the visit of the nuncio is so\r\nsignificant for Austria, that the visit of your majesty's minister in\r\nhis company was imperative.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your eminence comes to speak of state affairs?\" inquired the empress,\r\nsurprised.\r\n\r\nThe nuncio drew from his robe a parchment to which was affixed a ribbon\r\nwith the papal seal.\r\n\r\n\"His holiness instructed me to read this document to your apostolic\r\nmajesty,\" said Monsignore Garampi, with a respectful inclination of the\r\nhead. \"Will your majesty allow me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said the empress, leaning forward to listen.\r\n\r\nThe nuncio then unfolded the parchment, and amid the breathless\r\nattention of all present, read the celebrated document, which in history\r\nbears the name of its first words \"Dominus ac Redemptor Noster.\" This\r\nletter stated that in all ages the pope had claimed the right to found\r\nreligious orders or to abolish them. It cited Gregory, who had abolished\r\nthe order of the Mendicant Friars; and Clement V., who had suppressed\r\nthat of the Templars. It then referred to the Society of the Brotherhood\r\nof Jesus. It stated that this society had hitherto been sustained and\r\nfostered by the papal see, on acccount of its signal usefulness and the\r\neminent piety of its members. But of late, the brotherhood had\r\nmanifested a spirit of contentiousness amongst themselves, as well as\r\ntoward other orders, organizations, and universities; and had thereby\r\nfallen under the displeasure of the princes from whom they had received\r\nencouragement and protection.\r\n\r\nWhen the nuncio had read thus far, he paused and raised his eyes to the\r\nface of the empress. It was very pale and agitated, while the\r\ncountenance of the emperor, on the contrary, was flushed with triumph.\r\nJoseph tried to meet the glance of Prince Kaunitz's eye, but it was\r\nblank as ever; sometimes fixed vacantly upon the nuncio, and then\r\nturning with cold indifference toward the speaking countenances of the\r\ndevoted friend and inveterate enemy of the Order of Jesus.\r\n\r\n\"Go on, your eminence,\" at length faltered the empress.\r\n\r\nThe nuncio bowed and continued in an audible voice: \"Seeing that between\r\nthe Holy See and the kings of France, Spain, Portugal, and the Sicilies,\r\nmisunderstandings have arisen which are attributable to the influence\r\nof the Order of Jesus; seeing that the society at this present time has\r\nceased to bear the rich fruits of its past usefulness; the pope, after\r\nconscientious deliberation, has resolved, in the fulness of his\r\napostolic right, to suppress the brotherhood.\"\r\n\r\nA loud cry burst from the lips of the empress, as overwhelmed by these\r\nbitter tidings she covered her face with her hands. The emperor\r\napproached as though he wished to address her, but she waved him off\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Away, Joseph!\" said she; \"I will listen neither to your condolence nor\r\nto your exultation. Let me advise you, too, to moderate your transports,\r\nfor this is Austrian soil, and no one reigns in Austria but Maria\r\nTheresa. The Jesuits have been a blessing to mankind; they have\r\ninstructed our youth, and have been the guardians of all knowledge; they\r\nhave encouraged the arts and sciences, and have disseminated the\r\nChristian faith in every part of the world. They have been the true and\r\nloyal friends of my house; and in their day of adversity, though I may\r\nnot defend them against their ecclesiastical superiors, I will protect\r\nthem against malice and insult.\"\r\n\r\nThus spoke the generous and true-hearted Maria Theresa; but her efforts\r\nto sustain the Jesuits, as an organized brotherhood, were fruitless.\r\nThey were an ecclesiastic fraternity, and as such, their existence was\r\nbeyond the reach of civil authority. As individuals, they were her\r\nsubjects; but as a society, they were amenable to the laws of the\r\nChurch, and by that code alone, they stood or fell.\r\n\r\nBravely she struggled; but the earnest representations of the nuncio,\r\nthe sharp, cutting arguments of Kaunitz, and her own reluctance to come\r\nto a rupture with the pope in a matter essentially within ecclesiastical\r\njurisdiction, all these things united, bore down her opposition; and\r\nwith the same reluctance as she had felt in acquiescing to the partition\r\nof Poland, she consented to the suppression of the Society of Jesus.\r\n\r\n\"Come hither, my son,\" said the empress, reaching her hand to Joseph.\r\n\"Since I have seen fit to give my consent to this thing, I have nothing\r\nwherewith to reproach you. As co-regent I hope that what I am about to\r\nsay will obtain your approbation. Monsignore, you have read to me the\r\norder of his holiness, Clement XIV., for the suppression of the Jesuits.\r\nFor my part, nothing would ever have induced me to expel them from my\r\ndominions. But since his holiness sees fit to do so, I feel it to be my\r\nduty, as a true daughter of the Church, to allow the order to be put\r\ninto execution. [Footnote: The empress's own words. Gross-Horitnger,\r\nvol. i., p. 195.] Acquaint his holiness with my decision, and remain a\r\nfew moments that you may witness the promptitude with which his\r\nintentions shall be carried out.\"\r\n\r\nShe sat down to her escritoire, and tracing a few lines upon a piece of\r\npaper, handed it to Prince Kaunitz.\r\n\r\n\"Prince,\" said she, \"here is the order, which, in accordance to strict\r\nform, must be in my own handwriting. Take it to Cardinal Migazzi. Let\r\nhim carry out the intentions of the pope, and himself perform the\r\nfuneral rites of the devoted Sons of Jesus.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned away her head, that none might see the tears which were\r\nstreaming from her eyes. Then rising from her seat, she crossed the\r\nroom. Those who had brought this grief upon her, watched her noble form,\r\nand as they saw how her step faltered, they exchanged silent glances of\r\nsympathy. When she reached the door, she turned, and then they saw her\r\npale, sad face and tearful eyes.\r\n\r\n\"When the cardinal visits the College of the Jesuits to read the papal\r\norder, let an imperial commissarius accompany him,\" said Maria Theresa\r\nin an imperative tone. \"Immediately after its promulgation, he shall\r\npromise to the Jesuits my imperial favor and protection, if they submit\r\nto the will of the pope as becomes true servants of God and of the\r\nChurch. It shall also be exacted that the proceedings against the Order\r\nof Jesus shall be conducted with lenity and due respect; and for the\r\nfuture, I shall never suffer any member of the society to be treated\r\nwith contumely or scorn.\" [Footnote: The empress's words. Adam Wolf.\r\n\"Maria Theresa,\" p. 432.]\r\n\r\nShe bowed her lofty head, and withdrew.\r\n\r\nComplete silence followed the disappearance of the empress. No one dared\r\nto violate the significance of the moment by a word. The nuncio bowed\r\nlow to the emperor and retired; but as Kaunitz was about to follow,\r\nJoseph came hastily forward and clasped him in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"I thank you,\" whispered he. \"You have fulfilled your pledges, and\r\nAustria is free. My obligations to you are for life!\"\r\n\r\nThe two ministers then went down together to the great palace gate,\r\nwhere their state-carriages awaited them.\r\n\r\nPrince Kaunitz greeted the nuncio with another silent bow; and shrinking\r\nfrom the blasts of a mild September day, [Footnote: The papal order was\r\npromulgated in Vienna on September 10, 1773.] wrapped himself up in six\r\ncloaks, and sealed up his mouth with a huge muff of Rahles. He then\r\nstepped into his carriage, and drove off. Once safe and alone within his\r\nexhausted receiver, he dropped his muff for a moment, and, wonderful to\r\nrelate--he smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Let Wings shape themselves as they will,\" said he, thoughtfully. \"I am\r\nabsolute master of Austria. Whether the sovereign be called Maria\r\nTheresa, or Joseph, it is all one to me. Both feel my worth, and both\r\nhave vowed to me eternal gratitude. Poland has fallen--the Jesuits are\r\ndispersed; but Kaunitz is steadfast, for he is the pillar upon which the\r\nimperial house leans for support!\"\r\n\r\nFour weeks after the publication of the papal order by Cardinal Migazzi,\r\nthe great doors of the Jesuit College were opened, and forth from its\r\nportals came the brotherhood of the Order of Jesus.\r\n\r\nLed by their superior, all in their long black cassocks, with rosaries\r\nhanging at their blue girdles, they left the familiar home, which had\r\nbeen theirs for a hundred years. Each one carried in his hands his Bible\r\nand breviary. The faces of the brothers were pale and unspeakably sad,\r\nand their lips were compressed as though to thrust back the misery that\r\nwas surging within their hearts.\r\n\r\nThe multitude were mute as they. Not a word, whether of sympathy or of\r\nanimosity, greeted the silent procession. On went the noiseless,\r\nspectre-like train until it reached the market-place. There the superior\r\nstopped, and the brothers gathered around him in one vast circle.\r\n\r\nHe uncovered his head, and all followed his example. All bowed their\r\nheads in prayer to God who had willed that this great humiliation should\r\nbefall them. In one last petition to Heaven for resignation, they bade\r\nadieu to their glorious past with its glorious memories; and the people,\r\novercome by the simple sublimity of the scene, fell upon their knees and\r\nwept, repeating, while they wept, the prayers which they had learned\r\nfrom the teachers with whom they were parting forever.\r\n\r\nThe prayer was ended, and now the superior went from brother to brother,\r\ntaking the hand of each one. And every man faltered a blessing which\r\ntheir chief returned. So he went from one to another, until he had\r\ngreeted them all; then passing from the crowd, with a Jesuit on either\r\nside, he disappeared.\r\n\r\nSo ended the dispersion of the Order of Jesus, whom the whole world\r\nbelieved to be crushed forever. But they knew better; for, as crowding\r\naround their chief, they had whispered: \"Shall we ever be a brotherhood\r\nagain?\" he had returned the pressure of their friendly hands, and had\r\nreplied with prophetic fervor:\r\n\r\n\"Yes; whenever it is God's will to reinstate us. Wait patiently for the\r\nhour. It will surely come; for Loyola's order, like the soul, is\r\nimmortal!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVI.\r\n\r\nHEART-STRUGGLES.\r\n\r\nThe week of delay which the empress had granted to the Countess Margaret\r\nhad passed away, and the eve of her bridal had dawned. During those\r\neight eventful days the countess had been more fitful than ever, and her\r\nuncle's household had suffered accordingly.\r\n\r\n\"She will take her life,\" whispered the servants among themselves, as\r\neach day, like a pale spectre, she glided through the house, to mount\r\nher wild Arabian. The two footmen who accompanied her on these\r\noccasions, told how she galloped so madly that they could scarcely keep\r\npace with her; and then suddenly checked her horse, and with her head\r\nbent over its neck, remained motionless and wept.\r\n\r\nOnce the emperor had surprised her in tears, and when she became aware\r\nof his presence, she started off on a mad run and left him far behind.\r\nThis occurred twice; but the third time the emperor came upon her so\r\nquickly, that before she had time to fly, he had grasped her rein. The\r\nfootmen declared that they had never heard such a cry as she gave; and\r\nthey thought that the emperor would be highly offended. But he only\r\nlaughed, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Now, countess, you are my prisoner; and I shall not allow my beautiful\r\nAmazon to go, until she has told me why we never see her at court.\"\r\n\r\nThe countess turned so pale that her servants thought she would fall\r\nfrom her horse, and the emperor cried out: \"Good Heaven! what is the\r\nmatter with you?\"\r\n\r\nShe broke into a loud laugh, and striking her horse with the whip, tried\r\nto gallop off again. But the emperor put spurs to his horse, and the two\r\ndashed on together. Neck and neck they ran; the countess lashing her\r\nArabian until he made wild leaps into the air, the emperor urging his\r\nBarb with whip and spur, until his flanks were white with foam. At last\r\nhe came so near, that he made a grasp at her rein and caught it,\r\nexclaiming, with a merry laugh:\r\n\r\n\"Caught again!\"\r\n\r\nThe countess turned around with eyes that darted lightning.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you laugh so immoderately?\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"Because we are enacting such a delightfully comic scene. But do not\r\nlook so angry; your bright eyes are on fire, and they make a man's heart\r\nboil over. Answer my question, and I restore you to freedom. Why do you\r\nshun me, and why do you never come to court?\"\r\n\r\nNow the pale cheeks flushed, and the voice was subdued until its tones\r\nwere like plaintive music. \"Sire, I do not visit the court, because I am\r\na poor, unhappy creature, unfitted for society, and because no one\r\nmisses me there.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why do you fly from me as if I were Lucifer, the son of the\r\nmorning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, your majesty, grief flies from the light of day, and seeks the\r\ncover of friendly night! And now, free my horse, if you would not have\r\nme fall dead at your feet!\"\r\n\r\nAgain she turned pale, and trembled from head to foot. When the emperor\r\nsaw this, he loosed her rein, and bowing to her saddle bow, galloped\r\naway--out of sight. The countess turned her horse's head, and went\r\nslowly home.\r\n\r\nAll this Count Starhemberg learned from the footmen, for never a word\r\nhad his niece spoken to him since the unhappy day of Count Esterhazy's\r\nvisit. To say the truth, the old man was not sorry that her sorrow had\r\ntaken the shape of taciturnity; for her pale cheeks and glaring eyes\r\naffrighted him; and he hugged himself close in his short-lived security,\r\nas each day she declined to appear at table, and was served in the\r\nsolitude of her own room. She was served; but her food returned\r\nuntouched. Neither did she seem to sleep; for at all times of the night\r\nshe could be heard pacing her room. Then she would sit for hours before\r\nher piano; and, although her playing and singing had been equally\r\nrenowned, her uncle had never suspected the genius that had lain\r\nconcealed in the touch of her hands and the sound of her voice. It was\r\nno longer the \"fierce countess,\" whose dashing execution had distanced\r\nall gentler rivals; it was a timid maiden, whose first love was finding\r\nutterance in entrancing melody. On the night following her last\r\nencounter with the emperor, the music became more passionate in its\r\ncharacter. It was less tender, but far more sad; and often it ceased,\r\nbecause the musician stopped to weep.\r\n\r\nHer uncle heard her sob, and following the impulse of his affection and\r\ncompassion, he opened the room, and came softly in. He called her, and\r\nshe raised her head. The light from the wax-candles that stood on the\r\nharpsichord fell directly upon her face, which was bedewed with tears.\r\nHer uncle's entrance seemed neither to have surprised nor irritated her.\r\nWith an expression of indescribable woe she merely murmured\r\n\r\n\"See, uncle, to what the empress has reduced me.\"\r\n\r\nHer uncle took her in his arms, and, like a weary child, she leaned her\r\nhead upon his shoulder. Suddenly she started, and disengaging herself,\r\nshe stood before him, and took his hands in hers.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, is it inevitable? Must I bow my head like a slave to this marriage,\r\nwhile my heart proclaims an eternal NO!\"\r\n\r\nThe old count wiped his eyes. \"I fear there is no hope, my child. I have\r\ndone all that I could.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you done?\"\r\n\r\n\"I first appealed to Count Esterhazy; but he declared himself to be too\r\nintoxicated by your beauty to resign you. I then tried to interest some\r\nof our friends at court; but no one dared to intercede for my darling.\r\nThe empress has received a severe blow in the expulsion of the Jesuits,\r\nand no one has the courage to come between her and her mania for\r\nmatch-making. I then appealed to her majesty myself; but in vain. Her\r\nonly answer was this: 'You were to marry the count, or go into a\r\nconvent.' She added, that to-morrow every thing would be prepared in the\r\ncourt chapel for your marriage; that she, herself, would honor you by\r\ngiving you away; and that, if you did not come punctually, when the\r\nimperial state coach was sent for you, she would have you taken instead\r\nto a convent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\" asked she, with a painful blush.\r\n\r\n\"No, Margaret. I saw the emperor also.\"\r\n\r\n\"What said he?\" asked the countess, in a hoarse voice, pressing so\r\nheavily upon the old man's shoulder, that he could scarcely stand under\r\nthe weight of her hands. \"Word for word, tell me what he said.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you. The emperor said: 'Dear count, no one would serve you\r\nsooner than I. But as regards her mania for marrying people, the empress\r\nis inflexible. And, indeed, it seems to me that she has chosen admirably\r\nfor your beautiful niece. Count Esterhazy is young, handsome, immensely\r\nrich, and a favorite at court. You will see, dear count, that she will\r\nend by making him an affectionate and obedient wife; for a young girl's\r\nhate is very often nothing but concealed love. Those were the emperor's\r\nwords, my dear. I protested against his interpretation of your dislike\r\nto Count Esterhazy--but in vain.\"\r\n\r\nTo this, Margaret replied not a word. Her hands had gradually fallen\r\nfrom her uncle's shoulders, until they hung listless at her side. Her\r\ngraceful head was bowed down by the sharp stroke of the humiliation\r\nwhich had just stricken her, and her whole attitude was that of hopeless\r\ndisconsolation.\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments she threw back her head with wild defiance. \"He will\r\nfind that he is a false prophet,\" exclaimed she, with a laugh of scorn.\r\n\"I promise him that.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my dear girl--\" began Count Starhemberg. \"Will you, too, insult me\r\nwith prophecies of my future obedience to this fine young man? Do you,\r\ntoo, wish to prove to me that I am a fortunate--\"\r\n\r\n\"My child, I wish nothing of the sort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what means the 'but'? Does it mean that I am to be consoled by the\r\nsplendor that is to attend this--execution? Does it mean that my\r\nmaidenly blushes--the blushes that betray my secret love--are to be\r\nhidden by a veil of priceless lace? Does it mean that the chains, with\r\nwhich your peerless empress will fetter my arms, are to be of gold,\r\nsecured with diamonds? Have you taken care to provide the myrtle-wreath,\r\nthe emblem of love, wherewith to deck the bride's bow? O God! O God! May\r\nsome imperial daughter of this woman suffer worse than death for this!\"\r\n\r\nThe count shuddered, and left the room. He had not dared to say that, in\r\ntruth, her bridal-dress was all that she had described. It had all been\r\nchosen. The rich robe, the costly veil, the golden bracelets, the\r\nglittering diamonds, even the myrtle-wreath, the emblem of the humble as\r\nwell as the high-born bride--all were there, awaiting the morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE FORCED BRIDAL.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony was to take place at eleven o'clock. The imperial carriage\r\nof state was at the door; and behind it stood the gilded coaches of\r\nCounts Esterhazy and Starhemberg. The former had been awaiting the\r\nappearance of his bride for two hours; but to all his tender messages\r\nshe had curtly replied that she would come when she was ready.\r\n\r\n\"I fear she will play us some dreadful trick,\" sighed the old count.\r\n\r\n\"My dear count,\" returned Esterhazy, \"no man would be so presuming as to\r\nthwart the empress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not--but my niece has more character than some men.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have I done for her to scorn me as she does!\" cried the unhappy\r\nlittle bridegroom.\r\n\r\n\"You have opposed her, that is all. My niece is an Amazon, and cannot\r\nbear to give up her heart at another's will! Had she been left free, it\r\nmight have been otherwise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you really think she will come to love me?\" asked Esterhazy,\r\nsurveying his diminutive comeliness in the mirror opposite.\r\n\r\n\"I am quite sure of it, and so is the emperor. Take courage, then; bear\r\nwith her whims for a while; they are nothing but harmless summer\r\nlightnings. Do not heed the storm; think of the flowers that will spring\r\nup to beautify your life, when the showers of her tears shall have\r\npassed away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I will be patient. She shall exhaust herself.\"\r\n\r\nHere the door opened, and the countess's maid entered with a request\r\nthat Count Esterhazy would follow her to her lady's apartment.\r\n\r\nThe count kissed his hand to Count Starhemberg and hurried away. When he\r\nentered the countess's sitting-room, she was standing in all the pride\r\nof her bridal attire, and seemed more transcendently beautiful than\r\never. The court-dress, with its long trail, heightened the elegance of\r\nher figure, and the silver-spotted veil, that fell to her feet,\r\nenveloped her like a white evening cloud. But how little did her face\r\naccord with this superb festive dress Her cheek was deadly pale; her\r\nexquisite mouth was writhing with anguish, and her great, glowing eyes\r\ndarted glances of fiery hatred.\r\n\r\n\"You really have the courage to persevere, Count Esterhazy? You will\r\nperpetrate the crime of marriage with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"When a man opens his arms to receive the most enchanting woman that\r\never was sent on earth, do you call that a crime?\" said Esterhazy,\r\ntenderly.\r\n\r\nAn impatient shrug was the answer to this attempt at gallantry.\r\n\r\n\"Have I not told you that you would earn nothing for your reward but my\r\nhatred? In the despair of my heart, have I not told you that I love\r\nanother man? Oh, you have come to tell me that you spare me the\r\nsacrifice--have you not? You will not force a helpless girl to marry\r\nyou, who does so only to escape a convent--will you? Oh, tell me that\r\nyou have summoned manliness enough to resist the empress, and to give me\r\nmy freedom!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have summoned manliness enough to resist you; and bearing your anger,\r\nI am resolved to take the bewitching woman to wife whom my generous\r\nempress has selected for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a contemptible coward!\" cried she.\r\n\r\n\"I forgive you the epithet, because I am in love,\" replied he, with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"But if you have no pity for me,\" cried she wildly, \"have pity on\r\nyourself. You have seen how I treat my uncle, and yet I love him dearly.\r\nThink what your fate will be, since I hate you immeasurably.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said he, \"can you expect me to be more merciful to myself than to\r\nyou? No, no! I rely upon my love to conquer your hate. It will do so all\r\nin good time.\"\r\n\r\n\"As there is a God in heaven, you will rue this hour!\" cried Margaret\r\nwith mingled defiance and despair.\r\n\r\n\"Come, countess, come. The empress and her son await us in the\r\ncourt-chapel.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret shivered, and drew her veil around her. She advanced toward the\r\ndoor, but as the count was in the act of opening it, she laid her two\r\nhands upon his arm, and held him back. \"Have mercy with my soul!\" sobbed\r\nshe. \"It is lost if I become your wife. I have a stormy temper, and\r\nsorrow will expand it into wickedness. I feel that I shall be capable of\r\ncrime if you force me to this marriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gracious Heaven!\" cried the count, pettishly, \"if you abhor me to such\r\na degree, why do you not go into a convent?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had resolved to do so, for the convent is less repulsive to me than a\r\nhome in your palace; but I could not bring myself to the sacrifice.\r\nNo!--Were I to be immured within those convent walls, I should forever\r\nbe shut out from the sight of him whom I love. Do you hear this? Do you\r\nhear that I marry you only to be free to see him, to hear his voice, to\r\ncatch one glance of his eye as he passes me in the crowd? Oh, you will\r\nnot take to wife a woman who meditates such perjury as this! You will\r\nnot give your father's name to her who is going to the altar with a lie\r\nupon her lips and a crime upon her soul! Go-tell all this to the\r\nempress. Tell her that you will not disgrace your noble house by a\r\nmarriage with me! Oh, Count Esterhazy, be merciful, be merciful!\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible, countess, impossible; were it even possible for me to belie\r\nyou by such language. I shall not see the empress until we stand before\r\nthe altar together, and then she will be in her oratorium, far beyond my\r\nreach.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, you can reject nie at the altar. Oh, see how I humble myself!\r\nI am on my knees before you. Spurn me from you in the face of the whole\r\nworld!\"\r\n\r\nCount Esterhazy looked thoughtful. Unhappily, the countess on her knees\r\nwas more beautiful than ever; so that remembering her uncle's words, he\r\nsaid to himself\r\n\r\n\"Yes-I will humor her-I must feign to yield.\"\r\n\r\nHe stretched out his hands, saying, \"Rise, countess. It does not become\r\na sovereign to kneel before her slave. I have no longer the power to\r\noppose your will. Before the altar, I will say `No' to the priest's\r\nquestion, and you shall be free.\"\r\n\r\nThe countess uttered a loud cry of joy, and rose to her feet. And as her\r\npale cheek kindled with hope, and her eyes beamed with happiness, she\r\nwas more beautiful than she had ever been in her life before, and Count\r\nEsterhazy exulted over it.\r\n\r\n\"God bless you!\" exclaimed she, with a heavenly smile. \"You have earned\r\nmy affection now; for my life I vow to love you as a cherished brother.\r\nCome, dear, generous, noble friend, come. Let us hasten to the chapel.\"\r\n\r\nIt was she now who opened the door. Count Starhemberg awaited them in\r\nthe drawing-room. Margaret flew to meet him, and embracing him, said\r\n\r\n\"Do I not look like a happy bride now? Come, uncle, come, dear Count\r\nEsterbazy, let us go to our bridal.\"\r\n\r\nShe took Esterhazy's arm, and be placed her in the carriage. The old\r\ncount followed, in speechless wonder.\r\n\r\nAt the door of the chapel, they were met by the empress's first lady of\r\nhonor, who conducted the bride to the altar. The emperor walked by the\r\nside of Count Esterhazy. The face of the countess was radiant with\r\nhappiness, and all who saw her confessed that she was lovely beyond all\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nAnd now the ceremonial began. The priest turned to Count Esterhazy and\r\nasked him if he took the Countess Maragret von Starhemberg for his\r\nwedded wife--to love, honor, and cherish her until death should them\r\ndivide.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, and Margaret looked with a bright smile at the face\r\nof her bridegroom. But the eyes of the spectators were fixed upon him in\r\nastonishment, and the brow of the empress grew stormy.\r\n\r\n\"Will you take this woman for your wedded wife?\" repeated the priest.\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" said Esterhazy, in a loud firm voice.\r\n\r\nA cry escaped from the lips of Margaret. She was so faint that she\r\nreeled and would have fallen, but for the friendly support of an arm\r\nthat sustained her, and the witching tones of a voice that whispered:\r\n\"Poor girl, remember that a cloister awaits you.\" She recognized the\r\nvoice of the emperor; and overcoming her weakness, the courage of\r\ndespair came to her help.\r\n\r\nShe raised herself from Joseph's arms and taking the vinaigrette that\r\nwas tendered her by the lady of honor, she inhaled its reviving aroma;\r\nthen she looked at the priest.\r\n\r\nHe continued, and repeated his solemn question to her. Etiquette\r\nrequired that before she answered, she should have the sanction of the\r\nempress. The countess turned, with a low inclination, to the lady of\r\nhonor, who, in her turn, courtesied deeply to the empress.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa bowed acquiescence, and the bride, having thanked her with\r\nanother courtesy, turned once more to the priest and said, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nThe ceremony was over, and the young couple received the\r\ncongratulations of the court. Even the empress herself descended\r\nfrom the oratorium to meet them.\r\n\r\n\"I have chosen a very excellent husband for you,\" said she, smiling,\r\n\"and I have no doubt you will be a very happy woman.\" \"It must be so, of\r\ncourse, your majesty,\" replied the bride; \"for had your majesty not\r\nascertained that this marriage had been made in heaven, you would not\r\nhave ordered it on earth, I presume.\" Maria Theresa darted a look of\r\nanger at the countess, and turning her back upon such presumption,\r\noffered her good wishes to the count.\r\n\r\n\"What did you say, to irritate the empress so?\" whispered Joseph to the\r\nbride.\r\n\r\nMargaret repeated her words. \"That was a bold answer,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Has your majesty ever taken me for a coward? I think I have shown\r\npreter-human courage this day.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Because you have married Count Esterhazy? Believe me, you will be\r\nthe happiest of tyrants, and he the humblest of your slaves.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will show him that slaves deserve the lash!\" cried she, with a look\r\nof hatred at her husband, who came forward to conduct her to the palace,\r\nwhere the marriage guests were now to be received.\r\n\r\nThe festivities of the day over, the empress's lady of honor conducted\r\nthe countess to her new home. It was the duty of this lady to assist the\r\nbride in removing her rich wedding-dress, and assuming the costly\r\nneglige which lay ready prepared for her on a lounge in her magnificent\r\ndressing-room.\r\n\r\nBut the countess imperiously refused to change her dress. \"Have the\r\ngoodness,\" said she, \"to say to her majesty, that you conducted me to my\r\ndressing-room. You can say further,\" added she, hearing the door open,\r\n\"that you left me with Count Esterhazy.\"\r\n\r\nShe pointed to the count, who entered, greeting the ladies with a\r\nrespectful bow.\r\n\r\n\"I will leave you, then,\" said the lady, kissing Marearet's forehead.\r\n\"May Heaven bless you!\"\r\n\r\nCount Esterhazy was now alone with his wife. With a radiant smile and\r\nboth hands outstretched, he came toward her.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome to my house, beautiful Margaret! From this hour you reign\r\nsupreme in the palace of the Esterhazys.\"\r\n\r\nThe countess stepped back. \"Do not dare to touch my hand. A gulf yawns\r\nbetween us; and if you attempt to bridge it, I will throw you, headlong,\r\ninto its fiery abyss.\"\r\n\r\n\"What gulf? Point it out to me, that I may bridge it with my love,\"\r\ncried Esterhazy.\r\n\r\n\"The gulf of my contempt,\" said she, coldly. \"You are a coward and a\r\nliar. You have deceived a woman who trusted herself to your honor; and\r\nGod in heaven, who would not hear my prayers, God shall be the witness\r\nof my vengeance. Oh, you shall repent from this hour to come, that ever\r\nyou called me wife! I scorn to be a liar like you, and I tell you to\r\nbeware. I will revenge myself for this accursed treachery.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not fear your revenge, for you have a noble heart. The day will\r\ncome when I shall be forgiven for my deception. Heaven is always clement\r\ntoward the repentant sinner; and you are my heaven, Margaret. I await\r\nthe day of mercy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such mercy as Heaven has shown to me, I shall show to you,\" cried she.\r\n\"And now, sir, leave this room. I have nothing more to say to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, Margaret!\" said Esterhazy, with an incredulous smile, \"you would\r\ndeny me the sweet right of visiting your room? Chide, if you will; but\r\nbe not so cruel. Let me have the first kiss--\"\r\n\r\nAs he attempted to put his arms around her, Margaret uttered a fearful\r\ncry. Freeing herself with such violence that Esterhazy reeled backward\r\nwith the shock, she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"You are worse than a coward, for you would take advantage of rights\r\nwhich my hatred has annulled forever.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Margaret, my wife--\"\r\n\r\n\"Count Esterhazy,\" said Margaret slowly, \"I forbid you ever to use that\r\nword in this room. Before the world I must endure the humiliation of\r\nbeing called your wife; but once over the threshold of my own room, I am\r\nMargaret Starhemberg, and you shall never know me as any other Margaret.\r\nNow go!\"\r\n\r\nShe pointed to the door; and as the count looked into her face, where\r\npassion was so condensed that it almost resembled tranquillity, he had\r\nnot the hardihood to persist. He felt that he had gained his first and\r\nlast victory.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had passed the door, Margaret locked and bolted it; then,\r\nalone with the supreme anguish that had been crushed for these long,\r\nlong hours, she fell upon her knees, and wept until the morning-star\r\nlooked down upon her agony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVIII.\r\n\r\nPRINCE LOUIS DE ROHAN.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal prince, Louis de Rohan, French ambassador at Vienna, had\r\npetitioned the empress for a private audience, and the honor had been\r\ngranted him. It was the first time, since a year, that he had enjoyed\r\nthis privilege; and the proud prince had determined that all Vienna\r\nshould know it, for all Vienna was fully aware of the empress's dislike\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by a brilliant cortege, the prince set out for the palace.\r\nSix footmen stood behind his gilded carriage, while inside, seated upon\r\ncushions of white satin, the prince dispensed smiles to the women, and\r\nnods to the men who thronged the streets to get a glimpse of his\r\nmagnificence. Four pages, in the Rohan livery, dispensed silver coin to\r\nthe populace; while behind came four carriages, bearing eight noblemen\r\nof the proudest families in France, and four other carriages which bore\r\nthe household of this haughty prince of church and realm. [Footnote: In\r\nthe beginning of the year 1780, Prince de Rohan was made cardinal and\r\ngrand almoner of France. Before that time, he had been Archbishop of\r\nStrasburg. \"Memoires sur la Vie Privee de Marie Antoinette,\" vol. i., p.\r\n47.]\r\n\r\nThe cortege moved slowly, and the people shouted. From every window,\r\nburgher's or nobleman's, handsome women greeted the handsome cardinal\r\nwho was known to be a connoisseur in female beauty. The crowd outside\r\nfollowed him to the palace-gates, and when his carriage stopped, they\r\nshouted so vociferously, that the noise reached the ears of the empress;\r\nand so long, that their shouts had not ceased when the cardinal, leaving\r\nhis brilliant suite, was ushered into the small reception-room where\r\nMaria Theresa awaited him.\r\n\r\nShe stood by the window, and half turned her head, as the prince, with\r\nprofoundest salutations, came forward. She received his obsequious\r\nhomage with a slight inclination of the head.\r\n\r\n\"Can your eminence tell me the meaning of this din?\" asked she, curtly.\r\n\r\n\"I regret not to be able to do so, your majesty. I hear no din; I have\r\nheard nothing save the friendly greetings of your people, whose piety\r\nedifies my heart as a priest, and whose welcome is dear to me as a quasi\r\nsubject of your majesty. For the mother of my future queen must allow me\r\nthe right to consider myself almost as her subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would prefer that you considered yourself wholly the subject of my\r\ndaughter; as I doubt whether she will ever find much loyalty in your\r\nheart, prince. But before we go further, pray inform me what means all\r\nthis parade attendant upon the visit of the French ambassador here\r\nto-day? I am not aware that we are in the carnival; nor have I an\r\nunmarried daughter for whom any French prince can have sent you to\r\npropose. \"\r\n\r\n\"Surely your majesty would not compare the follies of the carnival with\r\nthe solemnity of an imperial betrothal,\" said the archbishop,\r\ndeferentially.\r\n\r\n\"Be so good as not to evade my question. I ask why you came to the\r\npalace with a procession just fit to take its place in a carnival?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the day on which the mother of the dauphiness receives me, is a\r\ngreat festival for me. I have so long sued for an audience, that when it\r\nis granted me, I may well be allowed to celebrate it with the pomp which\r\nbefits the honor conferred.\"\r\n\r\n\"And in such a style that all Vienna may know it, and the rumor of your\r\naudience reach the ears of the dauphiness herself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot hope that the dauphiness takes interest enough in the French\r\nambassador to care whether he be received at a foreign court or not,\"\r\nreplied the cardinal, still in his most respectful tone. \"I request you\r\nto come to the point,\" said Maria Theresa, impatiently. \"Tell me, at\r\nonce, why you have asked for an audience? What seeks the French\r\nambassador of the empress of Austria?\"\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to say that had I appeared to-day before your majesty as the\r\nFrench ambassador, I would have been accompanied by my attaches and\r\nreceived by your majesty in state. But your majesty is so gracious as to\r\nreceive me in private. It follows, therefore, that the Cardinal de\r\nRohan, the cousin of the dauphin, visits the imperial mother of the\r\nyoung dauphiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"In other words, you come hither to complain of the dauphiness-consort;\r\nagain to renew the unpleasant topics which have been the cause of my\r\nrepeated refusals to see you here.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty, no. I deem it my sacred duty to speak confidentially\r\nto the mother of the dauphiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the mother of the dauphiness-consort will listen,\" cried the proud\r\nempress, sharply emphasizing the word \"consort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your majesty, the apparent oversight,\" said De ROhan, with a\r\nsmile. \"But as a prince of the church, it behooves me, above all things,\r\nto be truthful, and the Dauphiness of France is not yet\r\ndauphiness-consort. Your majesty knows that as well as I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that my daughter's enemies and mine have succeeded so far in\r\nkeeping herself and her husband asunder,\" said the empress bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"But the dauphiness possesses, in her beauty, worth, and sweetness,\r\nweapons wherewith to disarm her enemies, if she would but use them,\"\r\nsaid De Rohan, with a shrug. \"Unhappily, she makes no attempt to disarm\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come--say what you have to say without so much circumlocution,\" cried\r\nMaria Theresa, imperiously. \"What new complaint have the French against\r\nmy daughter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty is the only person that can influence the proud spirit of\r\nthe dauphiness. Marie Antoinette adores her mother, and your majesty's\r\nadvice will have great weight with her.\"\r\n\r\n\"What advice shall I give her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Advise her to give less occasion to her enemies to censure her levity\r\nand her contempt of conventional forms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who dares accuse my daughter of levity?\" said the empress, her eyes\r\nflashing with angry pride.\r\n\r\n\"Those who, in the corruption of their own hearts, mistake for\r\nwantonness that which is nothing more than the thoughtlessness of\r\nunsuspecting innocence.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are pleased to speak in riddles. I am Maria Theresa--not Oedipus. \"\r\n\r\n\"I will speak intelligently,\" said De Rohan, with his everlasting smile.\r\n\"There are many things, innocent in themselves, which do not appear so\r\nto worldly eyes. Innocence may be attractive in a cottage, but it is not\r\nso in a palace. An ordinary woman, even of rank, has the right, in the\r\nprivacy of her own room, to indulge herself in childish sport; but your\r\nmajesty's self cannot justify your daughter when I tell you that she is\r\nin the habit of playing wild games with the young ladies who have been\r\nselected as her companions.\"\r\n\r\n\"My poor little Antoinette!\" exclaimed the empress, her eyes filling\r\nwith compassionate tears. \"Her enemies, who do not allow her to be a\r\nwife, might surely permit her to remain a child! I have heard before\r\nto-day, of the harmless diversions which she enjoys with her young\r\nsisters-in-law. If there were any sense of justice in France, you would\r\nunderstand that, to amuse half-grown girls, the dauphiness must herself\r\nplay the child. But I know that she has been blamed for her natural\r\ngayety, poor darling; and I know that Madame de Marsan will never\r\nforgive her for feeling a sisterly interest in the education of the\r\nyoung princesses of France. [Footnote: Madame de Marsan was their\r\ngoverness.] I know that the saloons of Madame de Marsan are a hot-bed of\r\ngossip, and that every action of the dauphiness is there distorted into\r\ncrime. [Footnote: \"Memoires de Madame de Campan.\" vol. i., p. 65.] If my\r\nlord cardinal has nothing else to tell me it was scarcely worth his\r\nwhile to come to the palace in so pompous a manner, with such a solemn\r\nface.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not come to your majesty to accuse the dauphiness, but to warn\r\nher, against her enemies; for unfortunately she HAS enemies at court.\r\nThese enemies not only deride her private diversions, but, with\r\naffectation of outraged virtue, they speak of recreations, hitherto\r\nunheard of at the court of France.\"\r\n\r\n\"What recreations, pray?\"\r\n\r\n\"The dauphiness, without the sanction of the king; indulges in private\r\ntheatricals.\"\r\n\r\n\"Private theatricals! That must be an invention of her enemies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your majesty, it is the truth. The dauphiness and her\r\nmarried sisters-in-law take the female characters, and the brothers of\r\nthe king the male. Sometimes Monsieur de Campan, the private secretary\r\nof the deceased queen, and his son, who fills the same office for the\r\ndauphiness, join the actors. The royal troupe give their entertainments\r\nin an empty entre-sol, to which the household have no access. The Count\r\nof Provence plays the jeune premier, but the Count d'Artois also is\r\nconsidered a good performer. I am told that the costumes of the\r\nprincesses are magnificent, and their rivalry carried to the extreme.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress, affecting not to hear the last amiable remark, said \"Who\r\nare the audience?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is but one spectator, your majesty, the dauphin himself.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa's face lighted up at once, and she smiled.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal went on: \"The aunts of the dauphin themselves are not\r\nadmitted to their confidence, lest they might inform the king, and his\r\nmajesty forbid the indecorous representations.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall write to the dauphiness and advise her to give up these\r\nrepresentations,\" said Maria Theresa, calmly, \"not because they are\r\nindecorous, but because they are a pretext for her enemies. If she has\r\nthe approbation of her husband, that of itself ought to suffice to the\r\ncourt; for it is not an unheard thing to have dramatic representations\r\nby the royal family. Louis XIV. appeared on the boards as a dancer; and\r\neven under the pious Madame de Maintenon, the princes and princesses of\r\nFrance acted the dramas of Corneille and Racine.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they had the permission of the king, and none of them were future\r\nqueens.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of that? If the queen approved of the exhibition, the dauphiness\r\nmight surely repeat it. My daughter is doing no more at Versailles, than\r\nshe has been accustomed to do at Schonbrunn, in her mother's presence.\"\r\n\r\n\"The etiquette of the two courts is dissimilar,\" said De Rohan, with a\r\nshrug. \"In Vienna, an archduchess is permitted to do that which, in\r\nParis, would be considered an impropriety.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another complaint!\" cried the empress, out of patience.\r\n\r\n\"The dauphiness finds it a bore,\" continued De Rohan, \"to he accompanied\r\nwherever she goes, by two ladies of honor. She has, therefore, been seen\r\nin the palace, even in the gardens of Versailles, without any escort,\r\nexcept that of two servants.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you come to the end of your complaints?\" said the empress scarcely\r\nable to control her passion.\r\n\r\n\"I have, your majesty. Allow me to add, that the reputation of a woman\r\nseldom dies from a single blow--it expires gradually from repeated\r\npricks of the needle. And queens are as liable to such mortality as\r\nother women.\"\r\n\r\n\"It ill becomes the Prince de Rohan to pass judgment upon the honor of\r\nwomen,\" cried Maria Theresa, exasperated by his lip-morality. \"If the\r\nFrench ambassador presumes to come to me with such trivial complaints as\r\nI have heard to-day, I will direct my minister in Paris to make\r\nrepresentations to the king of another and a more serious nature.\"\r\n\r\n\"Regarding the unpardonable indifference of the dauphin to his wife?\"\r\nasked the cardinal, with sympathizing air.\r\n\r\n\"No. Regarding the unpardonable conduct of the French ambassador in\r\nVienna.\" exclaimed the empress. \"If the cardinal is so shocked at a\r\nslight breach of etiquette, he should be careful to conceal his own\r\ndeformities under its sheltering veil. Innocence may sin against\r\nceremony; but he, who leads a dissolute and voluptuous life, should make\r\ndecorum a shield wherewith to cover his own shame!\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank your majesty for this axiom so replete with worldly wisdom. But\r\nfor whom can it be intended? Certainly not for the dauphiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; for yourself, prince and cardinal!\" cried the empress, beside\r\nherself with anger. \"For the prelate who, unmindful of his rank and of\r\nits obligations, carries on his shameless intrigues even with the ladies\r\nof my court. For the ambassador who, leading a life of Oriental\r\nmagnificence, is treading under foot the honor of his country, by living\r\nupon the credulity of his inferiors. All Vienna knows that your\r\nhousehold makes unworthy use of your privileges as a foreign minister,\r\nby importing goods free of tax, and reselling them here. All Vienna\r\nknows that there are more silk stockings sold at the hotel of the French\r\nembassy than in all Paris and Lyons together. The world blames me for\r\nhaving revoked the privilege enjoyed by foreign embassies to import\r\ntheir clothing free of duty. It does not know that the abuse of this\r\nprivilege by yourself has forced me to the measure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty is very kind to take so much trouble to investigate the\r\naffairs of my household. You are more au fait to the details than\r\nmyself. I was not aware, for instance, that silk stockings were sold at\r\nthe embassy. No more than I was aware that I had had any amours with the\r\nladies of the court. I have a very cold heart, and, perhaps, that is the\r\nreason why I have never seen one to whom I would devote a second\r\nthought. As regards my manner of living, I consider it appropriate to my\r\nrank, titles, and means; and that is all that I feel it necessary to say\r\non the subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"You dispose of these charges in a summary manner. To hear you, one\r\nwould really suppose there was not the slightest ground for reproach in\r\nyour life,\" said the empress, satirically.\r\n\r\n\"That this is quite within the range of possibility, is proved by the\r\ncase of the dauphiness,\" replied De Rohan. \"If your majesty thinks so\r\nlittle of her breaches of etiquette, it seems to me that mine are of\r\nstill less consequence. And allow me to say, that the French nation will\r\nsooner forgive me a thousand intrigues with the ladies of Vienna, than\r\npass over the smallest deviation from court usages on the part of the\r\ndauphiness. Marie Antoinette has defied them more than once, and I fear\r\nme, she will bitterly repent her thoughtlessness. Her enemies are\r\nwatchful and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I see that they are watchful,\" exclaimed Maria Theresa, \"I see it.\r\nDo not deny it, you are one of those whose evil eyes see evil doings in\r\nevery impulse of my dear defenceless child's heart. But have a care, sir\r\ncardinal, the friendless dauphiness will one day be Queen of France, and\r\nshe will then have it in her power to bring to justice those who\r\npersecute her now!\" [Footnote: \"Memoires de Madame de Campan,\" vol. i.,\r\np. 47.]\r\n\r\n\"I hope that I shall never be accused of such fellowship,\" said De\r\nRohan, for the first time losing his proud self-possession.\r\n\r\n\"I, the Empress of Austria, accuse you to-day of it!\" cried Maria\r\nTheresa, with threatening mien. \"Oh, my lord, it does you little\r\nhonor--you, a royal personage and a prince of the church, to exchange\r\nletters with a Du Barry, to whose shameless ears you defame the mother\r\nof your future queen!\"\r\n\r\n\"When did I do this? When was I so lost to honor as to speak a\r\ndisrespectful word of the Empress of Austria?\"\r\n\r\n\"You deny it--do you? Let me tell you that your praise or your blame are\r\nall one to me; and if I have granted you this interview, it was to show\r\nyou how little I am disturbed by your censorious language. I know\r\nsomething of the intriguing at Versailles. I have even heard of the\r\nprivate orgies of the 'Oeil de Boeuf,' where Louis entertains his\r\nfavorites. And I will tell you what took place at the last one. The\r\nCountess du Barry was diverting the company with accounts of the\r\nhypocrisy of the Empress of Austria; and to prove it, she drew from her\r\npocket-book a letter, saying: 'Hear what the Cardinal de Rohan says\r\nabout her.' Now, cardinal, do you still deny that you correspond with\r\nher?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do deny it,\" said the prince, firmly. \"I deny that I ever have\r\nwritten her a word.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress took from her pocket a paper, and read as follows\r\n\r\n\"True, I have seen Maria Theresa weeping over the fate of Poland, but\r\nthis sovereign, who is such an adept in the art of dissimulation,\r\nappears to have tears and sighs at her command. In one hand she holds\r\nher pocket-handkerchief, and in the other the sword with which she cuts\r\noff a third of that unhappy country.\" [Footnote: \"Memoires de Weber\r\nconcernant Marie Antoinette,\" vol. viii., p. 803.]\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir cardinal, upon your sacred honor, did you or did you not write\r\nthese words?\"\r\n\r\nThe prince turned pale, and grasped the arm of the chair on which he\r\nsat.\r\n\r\n\"Upon your honor and your conscience, before God!\" reiterated the\r\nempress.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal raised his eyes slowly, and in a low voice, said \"I dare\r\nnot deny it. I wrote them. In an unlucky hour I wrote them--but not to\r\nDu Barry.\"\r\n\r\n\"To whom, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"To one who has betrayed me to Du Barry. Far be it for me to name him. I\r\nalone will bear the weight of your majesty's displeasure. I alone am the\r\nculprit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know of no culprit in the matter,\" replied Maria Theresa, throwing\r\nback her stately head. \"I stand before God and before the world, and\r\nevery man has a right to pass sentence upon my actions--even the\r\nCardinal de Rohan. I merely wish to show him that the dauphiness and her\r\nmother both know what to expect of his eminence.\"\r\n\r\n\"The dauphiness knows of this letter?\" cried De Rohan.\r\n\r\n\"It is she who sent me this copy.\"\r\n\r\nThe prince bowed his head down upon his hands.\r\n\r\n\"I am lost!\" murmured he.\r\n\r\nThe empress surveyed him with mistrust. Such emotion on the part of such\r\na man astonished her, and she doubted its sincerity.\r\n\r\n\"Why this comedy, prince?\" said she. \"I have already told you that I am\r\nindifferent to your opinion.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the dauphiness never will forgive me,\" said he, uncovering his\r\nface. \"My contrition is no comedy: for I look with prophetic eyes into\r\nthe future--and there I see anguish and tears.\"\r\n\r\n\"For whom?\" said Maria Theresa, scornfully.\r\n\r\n\"For me, and perchance for the dauphiness. She considers me her enemy,\r\nand will treat me as such. But hatred is a two-edged sword which is as\r\napt to wound the one who holds it as the one for whom it is unsheathed.\r\nOh, your majesty, warn the dauphiness! She stands upon the brow of a\r\nprecipice, and if she do not recede, her enemies will thrust her\r\nheadlong into the abyss below. Marie Antoinette is an angel of innocence\r\nand chastity, but the world in which she lives does not understand the\r\nlanguage of angels; and the wicked will soil her wings, that her purity\r\nmay not be a reproach to their own foulness. Warn the dauphiness to\r\nbeware of her enemies. But, as God hears me, I am not one of them. Marie\r\nAntoinette will never believe me, and, therefore, my fate is sealed. I\r\nbeg leave of your majesty to withdraw.\"\r\n\r\nWithout awaiting the answer, the prince bowed and retired.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa looked thoughtfully after him, and long after be had\r\nclosed the door, she remained standing in the centre of the room, a prey\r\nto the anxious misgivings which his visit had kindled in her heart.\r\n\r\n\"He is right,\" said she, after a time. \"She wanders upon the edge of a\r\nprecipice, and I must save her. But, oh my God! where shall I find a\r\nfriend who will love her enough to brave her displeasure, and, in the\r\nmidst of the flattery which surrounds her, will raise the honest voice\r\nof reproof and censure? Ah, she is so unhappy, my little Antoinette, and\r\nI have no power to help her! Oh my God! succor my persecuted child!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE POLES AT VIENNA.\r\n\r\nThe three powers which had lived so long at variance, had united\r\nthemselves in one common cause--the pacification of Poland. In vain had\r\nStanislaus refused his assent to their friendly intervention. In vain\r\nhad he appealed to England and France for help. Neither of these powers\r\nwas willing, for the sake of unhappy Poland, to become involved in a war\r\nwith three nations, who were ready to hurl their consolidated strength\r\nagainst any sovereign who would have presumed to dispute their joint\r\naction.\r\n\r\nIn vain King Stanislaus began, by swearing, that sooner than consent to\r\nthe dismemberment of Poland, he would lose his right hand. The three\r\npowers, tired of his impotent struggles, informed him, through their\r\nenvoys at Warsaw, that there were limits to the moderation which decorum\r\nprescribed to governments; that they stood upon these limits, and\r\nawaited his speedy acquiescence to the act of partition. [Footnote:\r\nRaumer, \"Contributions to Modern History,\" vol. iv., p 516.] The Russian\r\nempress added that, if Stanislaus did not call a convention of the\r\nPolish Diet to recognize the act, she would devastate his land, so that\r\nhe would not have a silver spoon left to him. [Footnote: Raumer,\r\n\"Contributions to Modern History,\" vol. i., p. 507.]\r\n\r\nThe unhappy king had no longer the nerve to brave such terrific threats.\r\nHe submitted to the will of his tyrants, and came in as a fourth power,\r\neager to obtain as much as he could for his own individual advantage.\r\n\r\nThe wretched Poles took no notice of the edicts of a king who had been\r\nforced upon them by a strange sovereign. Only a few cowards and\r\nhirelings obeyed the call for a convention; so that in all, there were\r\nonly thirty-six members, who, under the surveillance of Austrian and\r\nPrussian hussars, signed their names to the act of partition.\r\n\r\nThe King of Prussia received Pomerelia, and the district of Nantz;\r\nRussia took Livonia, and several important waywodeships; and Austria\r\nobtained the county of Zips, a portion of Galicia and of Lodomeria, and\r\nhalf of the palatinate of Cracow.\r\n\r\nHere and there an isolated voice was raised to protest against the\r\nstupendous robbery; but it was lost amidst the clash of arms and the\r\ntread of soldiery. Whenever a word was spoken that fretted the\r\nsensibilities of Austria or Prussia, Catharine said she was willing to\r\nbear all the blame of the thing; and, laughing heartily, she called the\r\nprotests that were sent on the subject, \"moutarde apres diner.\"\r\nFrederick resorted to self-deception, proclaiming to the world, \"that\r\nfor the first tune the King and the Republic of Poland were established\r\non a firm basis; that they could now apply themselves in peace to the\r\nconstruction of such a government as would tend to preserve the balance\r\nof power between proximate nations, and prevent them from clashing.\"\r\n[Footnote: Raumer, \"Contributions,\" p. 542.]\r\n\r\nThe Poles, in silent rancor, submitted to their fate, and took the oath\r\nof allegiance to their oppressors. New boundary-lines were drawn, and\r\nnew names assigned to the sundered provinces of the dismembered\r\nfatherland. The citadels were given over to their foreign masters, and\r\nnow the deed was consummated.\r\n\r\nEven Maria Theresa rejoiced to know it, and whether to relieve her\r\nburdened heart, or to pretend to the world that she approved of the\r\ntransaction, she ordered a solemn \"Te Deum\" to be sung in the cathedral\r\nof St. Stephen, in commemoration of the event.\r\n\r\nThe entire court was to assist at this ceremony, after which the empress\r\nwas to receive the oath exacted from those of her new subjects who\r\ndesired to retain possession of their property.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the court were in the anteroom, awaiting the entrance of\r\nthe sovereigns. Their handsome, rouged faces were bright with\r\nsatisfaction; for they had all suffered from the misery which, for a\r\nyear past, had been endured by their imperial mistress. Now they might\r\nlook forward to serene skies and a renewal of court festivities, and\r\nthey congratulated one another in triumph.\r\n\r\nBut they were cautious not to give too audible expression to their\r\nhopes. They whispered their expectations of pleasure, now and then\r\ncasting stolen glances at a tall figure in black, which, sorrowful and\r\nalone, stood tearfully regarding the crowds in the streets who were\r\nhurrying to church to celebrate her country's downfall. This was the\r\nCountess von Salmour, governess to the Archduchess Mariana. With the\r\nother ladies of the palace, she was to accompany the empress to the\r\ncathedral; but it was clear to all beholders that to her this was a day\r\nof supreme humiliation.\r\n\r\nThe great bell of St. Stephen's announced to her people that the empress\r\nwas about to leave the palace. The folding-doors were flung open, and\r\nshe appeared leaning on the arm of the emperor, followed by the princes,\r\nprincesses, generals, and statesmen of her realms. Silently the ladies\r\nof honor ranged themselves on either side of the room to let the\r\nimperial family pass by. Maria Theresa's eyes glanced hastily around,\r\nand fell upon the pale, wan features of the Countess von Salmour.\r\n\r\nAll eyes now sought the face of the unhappy lady, whose sad mourning\r\ngarments were in such striking contrast with the magnificent dresses of\r\nthe ladies around her.\r\n\r\n\"Madame von Salmour,\" said the empress, \"I dispense you from your duties\r\nfor this day. You need not accompany the court to church.\"\r\n\r\nThe countess courtesied deeply, and replied: \"Your majesty is right to\r\nexcuse me; for had I gone with the court to church, I might have been\r\ntempted to utter treason to Heaven against the oppressors of my\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nThe company were aghast at the audacity of the rejoinder, but the\r\nempress replied with great mildness:\r\n\r\n\"You are right; for the temptation would indeed be great, and it is\r\nnoble of you to speak the truth. I respect your candor.\"\r\n\r\nShe was about to pass on, but paused as if she had forgotten something.\r\n\r\n\"Is the Countess Wielopolska in Vienna?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"She arrived yesterday, your majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go to her while we are at church.\" said Maria Theresa, compassionately.\r\n\r\nMadame von Salmour glanced toward the emperor, who, with an expression\r\nof painful embarrassment, was listening to their conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your majesty,\" said the lady, \"the Countess Wielopolska is\r\nmaking preparations for a journey, and she receives no one. We parted\r\nyesterday. To-morrow she leaves Vienna forever.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad that she intends to travel,\" said Maria Theresa; approvingly.\r\n\"It will divert her mind;\" and with a friendly smile, she took leave of\r\nthe governess, and passed on.\r\n\r\nJoseph followed with wildly throbbing heart; and neither the triumphant\r\nstrains of the Te Deum, nor the congratulatory shouts of his subjects,\r\ncould bring back serenity to his stormy brow. He knelt before the altar,\r\nand with burning shame thought of his first entry into St. Stephen's as\r\nEmperor of Austria. It had been the anniversary of the deliverance of\r\nVienna by John Sobieski and his Poles; and in the self-same spot where\r\nthe emperor had thanked God for this deliverance, he now knelt in\r\nacknowledgment of the new principalities which were the fruits of his\r\nown ingratitude to Poland.\r\n\r\nFrom these painful and humiliating retrospections, the emperor's\r\nthoughts wandered to the beautiful being, who, like a hamadryad, had\r\nblended her life with the tree of Polish liberty. He thought of that\r\nface whose pallid splendor reminded him of the glories of waning day;\r\nand he listened through the long, dim aisles of memory, to the sound of\r\nthat enchanting voice, whose melody had won his heart long ago on that\r\nfirst, happy evening at Neustadt.\r\n\r\nThe Countess Wielopolska was leaving Vienna forever, and yet there was\r\nno message for him. A longing, that seemed to drown him in the flood of\r\nits intensity, rushed over his soul. He would fly to her presence and\r\nimplore her to forgive the chant of victory that was rejoicing over her\r\ncountry's grave! Oh, the crash of that stunning harmony, how it maddened\r\nhim, as kneeling, he listened to its last exultant notes!\r\n\r\nIt was over, and Joseph scarcely knew where he was, until his mother\r\nlaid her hand upon his shoulder and motioned him to rise.\r\n\r\nIn the great reception-room, with all the pomp of imperial splendor,\r\nMaria Theresa sat upon her throne and received the homage of her new\r\nsubjects. Each one, as he passed, knelt before the powerful empress, and\r\nas he rose, the chief marshal of the household announced his name and\r\nrank. The ceremony over, Maria Theresa descended from the throne to\r\ngreet her Polish subjects in a less formal manner. No one possessed to a\r\ngreater degree than herself the art of bewitching those whom she desired\r\nto propitiate; and to-day, though her youth and beauty were no longer\r\nthere to heighten the charms of her address, her elegant carriage, her\r\never-splendid eyes, and graceful affability, were as potent to win\r\nhearts as ever. Discontent vanished from the faces of the Poles, and by\r\nand by they gathered into groups, in which were mingled Hungarians,\r\nItalians, and Austrians, all the subjects of that one great empress.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the Poles had adopted the French costume of the day. Few\r\nhad possessed the hardihood to appear before their new sovereign in\r\ntheir rich national dress. Among these few was an old man of tall\r\nstature and distinguished appearance, who attracted the attention of\r\nevery one present.\r\n\r\nWhile his countrymen unbent their brows to the sunshine of Maria\r\nTheresa's gracious words, he remained apart in the recess of a window.\r\nWith scowling mien and folded arms, he surveyed the company; nor could\r\nthe empress herself, obtain from him more than a haughty inclination of\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\nThe emperor was conversing gayly with two Polish noblemen, whose\r\ncheerful demeanor bore evidence to the transitory nature of their\r\nnational grief, when he observed this old man.\r\n\r\n\"Can you tell me,\" said he, \"the name of yonder proud and angry\r\nnobleman?\"\r\n\r\nThe faces of the two grew scarlet, as following the direction of the\r\nemperor's finger, they saw the eyes of the old man fixed, with scorn,\r\nupon their smiling countenances.\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said one of them, uneasily, \"is Count Kannienski.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, the old partisan leader!\" exclaimed the emperor. \"As he does not\r\nseem inclined to come to me, I will go forward and greet him myself.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Joseph crossed over to the window where, the old count was\r\nstanding. He received him with a cold, solemn bow.\r\n\r\n\"I rejoice to meet Count Kannienski, and to express to him my esteem for\r\nhis character,\" began the emperor, reaching out his hand.\r\n\r\nThe count did not appear to perceive the gesture, and merely made a\r\nsilent bow. But Joseph would not be deterred from his purpose by a\r\nhauteur which he knew very well how to excuse.\r\n\r\n\"Is this your first visit to Vienna?\" asked he.\r\n\r\n\"My first and last visit, sire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you pleased with the Austrian capital?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty, Vienna does not please me.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor smiled. Instead of being irritated at the haughtiness with\r\nwhich his advances were met, he felt both respect and sympathy for the\r\nnoble old man who disdained to conceal his discontent from the eyes of\r\nthe sovereign himself.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder that you do not like Vienna. It has great attractions for\r\nstrangers, and you meet so many of your countrymen here just now!--there\r\nwere never as many Poles in Vienna before.\"\r\n\r\nAn angry glance shot athwart the face of the old man. \"There were many\r\nmore when John Sobieski delivered Vienna from the hands of her enemies,\"\r\nsaid he. \"But that is almost a hundred years ago, and the memory of\r\nprinces does not extend so far to the obligations of the past.\r\n[Footnote: This whole conversation is historical. It was often related\r\nby the emperor who said that he had been so touched by Count\r\nKannienski's patriotism and boldness, that but for the fear of a\r\nrepulse, he would have embraced him. Swinburne, vol. i., page 349.]\r\nBut,\" continued he, more courteously, \"I did not come here to speak of\r\nmy country. We must be resigned to the fate apportioned to us by\r\nProvidence, and you see how readily my countrymen adapt themselves to\r\nthe vicissitudes of their national life.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet, count, their smiles are less pleasing to me than your frowns.\r\nIn spite of the present, I cherish the past, and honor those who mourn\r\nover the misfortunes of their native land.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man was touched, and looked at the handsome, expressive face of\r\nthe emperor. \"Sire,\" said he, sadly, \"if Stanislaus had resembled you,\r\nPoland would have been free. But I have not come hither to-day to whine\r\nover the unalterable past. Nor did I come to pay homage to the empress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless the empress would rejoice to become acquainted with the\r\nbrave Count Kannienski. Allow me, count, to present you.\"\r\n\r\nKannienski shook his gray locks. \"No, sire, I came to Vienna purely for\r\nthe sake of a woman who will die under the weight of this day's anguish.\r\nI came to console her with what poor consolation I have to bestow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she a Pole?\" asked Joseph, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire; she is the last true-hearted Polish woman left on earth, and\r\nI fear she is about to die upon the grave of her fatherland.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I ask her name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Countess Anna Wielopolska. She it is who sent me to the palace, and I\r\ncame because she asked of me one last friendly service.\"\r\n\r\n\"You bring me a message?\" faltered the emperor.\r\n\r\n\"The countess begs to remind the emperor of the promise he made on the\r\nday when the empress signed the act of--\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember,\" interrupted the emperor.\r\n\r\n\"She asks, if mindful of his promise, he will visit her to-morrow\r\nafternoon at six o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where shall I find her?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the very same room which she occupied before. I have delivered my\r\nmessage. Your majesty will, therefore, permit me to withdraw.\"\r\n\r\nHe bowed and turned away. Slowly and proudly he made his way through the\r\ngiddy crowd, without a word of recognition for the frivolous Poles who\r\nsaluted him as he passed.\r\n\r\n\"He is the last Polish hero, as she is the last Polish heroine,\" sighed\r\nthe emperor, as he followed the old man with his eyes. \"Our destiny is\r\naccomplished. She would bid me a last farewell.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XC.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST FAREWELL.\r\n\r\nCountess Anna Wielopolska was alone in her room, which, like herself,\r\nwas decked to receive some great and distinguished guest. A rich carpet\r\ncovered the floor, flowers bloomed in costly vases, the piano was\r\nopened, and the music on the stand showed that the countess still found\r\nconsolation in her genius. But she herself was strangely altered since\r\nthe day on which she had thrown her bouquet to the emperor in Neustadt.\r\nNevertheless she wore the same dress of black velvet, the same jewels,\r\nand in her bosom the same bouquet of white roses, bound with a long\r\nscarlet ribbon.\r\n\r\nHer heart beat high, and her anxious eyes wandered to the little bronze\r\nclock that stood upon a console opposite. The clock struck six, and her\r\npale cheek flushed with anticipated happiness.\r\n\r\n\"It is the hour,\" said she. \"I shall see him once more.\" And as she\r\nspoke, a carriage stopped, and she heard his step within the vestibule\r\nbelow. Trembling in every limb, she approached the door, and bent her\r\near to listen.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he comes,\" whispered she, while, with a gesture of extreme\r\nagitation she drew from her pocket a little case, whence she took a tiny\r\nflask, containing a transparent, crimson liquid. She held it for a few\r\nseconds to the light, and now she could hear the sound of his voice, as\r\nhe spoke with Matuschka in the anteroom. The steps came nearer and\r\nnearer yet.\r\n\r\n\"It is time,\" murmured she; and hastily moving the golden capsule that\r\ncovered the vial, she put it to her lips and drank it to the last drop.\r\n\r\n\"One hour of happiness,\" said she, replacing the vial in her pocket, and\r\nhastening back to the door.\r\n\r\nIt was opened, and the emperor entered the room. Anna met him, with both\r\nhands outstretched, and smiled with unmistakable love as he came forward\r\nto greet her. Silent, but with visible agitation, the emperor looked\r\ninto those eyes, which were already resplendent with the glory of\r\napproaching death. Long they gazed upon each other without a word, yet\r\nspeaking love with eyes and lips.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the emperor dropped her hands, and laying his own gently upon\r\nher cheeks, he drew down her head, and rested it upon his breast. She\r\nleft it there, and looked up with a tender smile.\r\n\r\n\"Do not speak, love,\" said he. \"I am an astrologer, who looks into his\r\nheaven to read the secrets there. And, oh,\" sighed he, after he had\r\ngazed for a time. \"I see sorrow and suffering written upon that snowy\r\nbrow. Tears have dimmed the splendor of my stars, but they have not been\r\nable to lessen their beauty. I know you again, my queen of the night, as\r\nyou first appeared to me at Neustadt. You are still the same proud\r\nbeing, Anna.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, dearest, no. I am a trembling woman, craving nothing from earth\r\nsave the glance of my beloved, and the privilege of dying in his\r\nembrace.\"\r\n\r\n\"She who loves, desires to live for her lover,\" said he, pressing her\r\nagain and again to his heart.\r\n\r\n\"Death is the entrance to eternal life, and she who truly loves will\r\nlove throughout eternity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak not of death in this hour of ecstasy, when I have found you once\r\nmore as I had pictured you in dreams. Oh, Anna, Anna! will you part me\r\nfrom you again? Have you indeed brought me hither to cheat me with\r\nvisions of love, and then to say farewell, forever!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Joseph, I bid you eternal welcome. Oh, my lover, my soul has gone\r\nforth to meet yours, and nothing shall ever part us again.\"\r\n\r\n\"And are you mine at last!\" cried Joseph, kissing her passionately. \"Has\r\nthe statue felt the ray of love, and uttered its first sweet sound? Oh,\r\nhow I longed to hear that sound! I have gone about by day, wearing the\r\nweight of sovereignty upon my fainting shoulders; and by night I have\r\nwept like a lovesick boy for your sake, Anna; but no one suspected it.\r\nNo one knew that the emperor was unhappy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew it,\" whispered she--\"I knew it; for your sorrows have all been\r\nmine.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" cried Joseph, awaking from his dream of bliss, \"you told me\r\nthat Poland was dearer to you than I. I remember it now You refused me\r\nyour hand, and forsook me for the sake of your country.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, now, beloved,\" said she, clinging to him, \"now I am but a woman--a\r\nwoman who abandons her fatherland with all its memories, and asks but\r\none blessing of Heaven--the blessing of living and dying in her lover's\r\narms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if you would not kill me, speak no more of dying, Anna! Now you are\r\nmine--mine for life; and my heart leaps with joy as it did when first I\r\nheard your heavenly voice. Let me hear it once more. Sing to me, my\r\ntreasure.\"\r\n\r\nShe went to the harpsichord, and the emperor bent over her, smiling as\r\nhe watched the motion of her graceful hands upon the keys. She struck a\r\nfew full chords, and then glided into a melody of melancholy sweetness.\r\nThe emperor listened attentively; then, suddenly smiling, he recognized\r\nthe song which she had sung before the King of Prussia and himself.\r\n\r\nThe words were different now. They represented Poland as a beggared\r\nqueen, wandering from door to door, repulsed by all. She is starving,\r\nbut she remembers that death will release her from shame and hunger.\r\n\r\nThe countess was singing these lines--\r\n\r\n    \"If life to her hath brought disgrace,\r\n     Honor returns with death's embrace--\"\r\n\r\nwhen she stopped and her hands fell powerless from the instrument. The\r\nemperor raised her head, and saw with alarm that her face was distorted\r\nby pain. Without a word, he took her in his arms, and, carrying her\r\nacross the room, laid her gently upon the sofa. She raised her loving\r\neyes to his, and tried to steal her arm around his neck, but it fell\r\nheavily to her side. Joseph saw it, and a pang of apprehension shook his\r\nmanly frame.\r\n\r\n\"Anna!\" groaned he, \"what means this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Honor returns with death's embrace,\" whispered she.\r\n\r\nThe emperor uttered a savage cry, and raised his despairing arms to\r\nheaven. \"And it was false,\" cried he, almost mad with grief--\"it was\r\nfalse! She had not forgotten Poland. Oh, cruel, cruel Anna!\" and he\r\nsobbed piteously, while she strove to put her trembling hand upon his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\"Cruel to myself, Joseph, for I have just begun to value life. But I\r\nswore to my mother that I would not outlive the disgrace of Poland; and\r\nyou would have ceased to love me had I violated my oath. Forgive the\r\npain I inflict upon you, dearest. I longed for one single hour of\r\nhappiness, and I have found it here. With my dying breath I bless you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there no remedy?\" asked he, scarcely able to speak.\r\n\r\n\"None,\" said she, with a fluttering smile. \"I obtained the poison from\r\nCagliostro. Nay--dear one, do not weep: you see that I could not live.\r\nOh, do not hide your face from me; let me die with my eyes fixed upon\r\nyours!\"\r\n\r\n\"And,\" cried Joseph, \"must I live forever?\"\r\n\r\n\"You must live for your subjects--live to be great and good, yet ever\r\nmistrusted, ever misunderstood. But onward, my prince, and the blessing\r\nof God be upon you! Think, too, that the Poles, my brethren, are among\r\nyour subjects, and promise me to love and cherish them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Try to reconcile them to their fate--do not return their ill-will;\r\nswear to me that you will be clement to my countrymen?\"\r\n\r\n\"I swear! I swear to respect their misfortunes, and to make them happy!\"\r\n\r\nOne last, beaming illuminated her face. \"Thank you--dearest,\" said she,\r\nwith difficulty. \"My spirit shall look out from the eye of every Pole,\r\nto whom you will have given--one moment--of joy! Oh, what agony!\r\nFarewell!\"\r\n\r\nOne more look--one shudder--and all was still.\r\n\r\nThe emperor fell upon his knees by the body, and prayed long and\r\nfervently. The little clock struck seven. The hour of happiness had\r\npassed away forever.\r\n\r\nThe following day, Joseph, pale, but perfectly calm, sought an interview\r\nwith his mother.\r\n\r\n\"I come to ask leave of absence of your majesty,\" said he, languidly.\r\n\r\n\"Leave of absence, my son? Do you wish to travel again so soon?\"\r\n\r\n\"I must travel, your majesty. I must make a journey to Galicia, to\r\nbecome acquainted with our new subjects.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it might be as well for us to show them some consideration at\r\nthis period. I had already thought of this; but I have been told that\r\nGalicia is rather an uncivilized country, and that the people are\r\nill-disposed toward us.\"\r\n\r\n\"We cannot expect them to love their oppressors, your majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"No--but it is a dreadful country. No roads--no inns--miles and miles of\r\nuninhabited woods, infested by robbers. Oh, my son, postpone your\r\njourney to a milder season! I shall be trembling for your safety.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no danger, your majesty. Give me your consent; I am very, very\r\ndesirous of visiting Poland.\"\r\n\r\n\"But no vehicle can travel there at this time of year, my son.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will go on horseback, your majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where will you get provisions, Joseph? Where will you rest at\r\nnight?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will rest wherever night overtakes me, either in a cottage, on my\r\nhorse, or on the ground. And as for food, mother, if there is food for\r\nour people, there will be some for me; and if there should be scarcity,\r\nit is but just that I should share their hardships. Let me go, I entreat\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go, then, my son, and God's blessing be with you,\" said the empress,\r\nkissing her son's forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Joseph!\" said she, as he was leaving the room, \"have you heard that the\r\npoor young Countess Anna has committed suicide on account of the\r\ntroubles in Poland?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty,\" replied Joseph, without flinching.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you had better defer your journey for a day to attend her\r\nfuneral. All the Poles will be there; and as we both knew and admired\r\nher, I think it would propitiate our new subjects if we gave some public\r\nmark of sympathy by following the body to the grave. I have forbidden\r\nmention to be made of the manner of her death, that she may not be\r\ndenied a resting-place within consecrated ground.\"\r\n\r\nHow she probed his wound until the flesh quivered with agony!\r\n\r\n\"The Countess Wielopolska is not to be interred in Austria, your\r\nmajesty,\" said he. \"Count Kannienski will accompany the body to Poland.\r\nNear Cracow there is a mound wherein it is said that Wanda, the first\r\nQueen of Poland, was buried. Anna Wielopolska will share her tomb. Her\r\nheroic spirit could rest nowhere save in Poland. When I visit Cracow I\r\nwill go thither to plant flowers upon her grave, that the white roses\r\nshe loved may grow from the consecrated earth that lies upon her heart.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCI.\r\n\r\nTHE CONCERT.\r\n\r\nTherese Paradies was to give a concert, the first at which she had\r\nperformed since the restoration of her sight. Of course, the hall was\r\nthronged, for in spite of the incontrovertible fact itself, and of its\r\ncorroboration by the Paradies family, there were two parties in\r\nVienna--one who believed in the cure, and the other who did not. Those\r\nwho did not, doubted upon the respectable testimony of Professor Barth,\r\nDoctor Ingenhaus, and the entire faculty, who, one and all, protested\r\nagainst the shameful imposition which Mesmer was practising upon an\r\nenlightened public.\r\n\r\nThe audience, therefore, was less interested in Therese's music,\r\nwonderful as it was, than in her eyes; for her father had announced that\r\nduring the pauses Therese would prove to the incredulous that her cure\r\nwas no deception.\r\n\r\nProfessor Barth, Doctor Ingenhaus, and the astronomer were there in the\r\nfront row, sneering away the convictions of all who were within hearing.\r\nHerr Paradies now appeared, and as he stood reckoning the profits that\r\nwere to gladden his pockets on that eventful evening, Barth left his\r\nseat and approached him.\r\n\r\n\"You really believe, do you, that your daughter sees?\" said the\r\nprofessor.\r\n\r\n\"She sees as well as I do. Were you not there to witness it yourself\r\nwhen her bandage was removed?\"\r\n\r\n\"I humored the jest to see how far the impudence of Mesmer and the\r\ncredulity of his admirers would travel together. I hear curious accounts\r\nof your daughter's mistakes, granting her the use of her eyesight. It is\r\nsaid that some one presented her a flower, when, looking at it, she\r\nremarked, 'What a pretty star!' And did she not put a hair-pin in her\r\nmother's cheek while trying to fasten her hair?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she did both these things, but I think they prove her to be making\r\nawkward use of a new faculty. She is not likely to know the name of a\r\nthing when she sees it for the first time; neither has she learned to\r\nappreciate distances. Objects quite close to her she sometimes stumbles\r\nupon, and those out of reach she puts out her hand to take. All this\r\nwill correct itself, and when Therese has become as familiar with\r\nprospective illusions as the rest of us, she will go out into the\r\nstreets, and the world will be convinced.\"\r\n\r\n\"You really believe it, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am as convinced of it as that I see myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very disinterested of you to publish it,\" said the professor,\r\nlooking significantly at the happy father. \"This acknowledgment will\r\ncost you a considerable sum.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" asked Von Paradies, frightened. \"I do not understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very simple, nevertheless,\" said the professor, carelessly. \"Does\r\nthe empress give your daughter a pension?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. You know she does, and a handsome one, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course it is lost to her,\" replied Berth, enjoying the sudden\r\npaleness which overspread the radiant face of Von Paradies. \"A girl who\r\nsees has no right to the money which is given to the blind, and I heard\r\nVon Stork this very day saying that as soon as it was proved that your\r\ndaughter could see, he intended to apply to the empress for her pension\r\nin behalf of another party.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this pension is our chief support; it enables us to live very\r\ncomfortably. If it were withdrawn, I should be a beggar.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would not alter the case. Pensions are granted to those who by\r\ntheir misfortunes have a claim upon the public charity. The claim dies\r\nfrom the moment that your daughter's infirmity is removed. Through the\r\nfavor of the empress she has become a scientific musician, and this now\r\nmust be her capital. She can teach music and give concerts.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that will not maintain us respectably,\" urged Von Paradies, with\r\nincreasing uneasiness.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it will not maintain you as you live with your handsome\r\npension. But you need not starve. Be that as it may, there is a blind\r\ncountess who is my patient, for whom Von Stork is to obtain the pension\r\nas soon as you can convince the faculty that your daughter is no longer\r\nin need of it. This patient, I assure you, will receive it as long as\r\nshe lives, for it will never enter into her head to fancy that she has\r\nbeen cured by Master Mesmer.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my dear professor,\" entreated Von Paradies, \"have mercy on me and\r\nmy family! For sixteen years we have received this income, and it had\r\nbeen secured to us during Therese's lifetime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, it goes to the countess, if she is not blind, I tell you.\r\nThe empress (so says Von Stork) has never refused a request of his\r\nbecause he never asks any thing but that which is just and reasonable.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are ruined!\" exclaimed Von Paradies, in accents of despair.\r\n\r\n\"Not unless you prove to us that your daughter IS NOT DECEIVING YOU,\"\r\nreplied Barth, with sharp emphasis. \"If you can show her to be blind,\r\nyou are saved; and Von Stork would petition the empress, in\r\nconsideration of the shameful imposition practised upon your paternal\r\nlove, to increase the pension. Well--this evening's entertainment will\r\ndecide the matter. Meanwhile, adieu!\"\r\n\r\nThe professor lounged back to his seat, leaving his poisoned arrow\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said Barth, smiling, as he saw the victim writhe, \"that I\r\nhave given him a receipt for his daughter's eyes that will be more\r\npotent than Mesmer's passes. It will never do to restore the age of\r\nmiracles.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed; if miracles are to make their appearance upon the stage of\r\nthis world, what becomes of science?\" asked Ingenhaus.\r\n\r\n\"Let us await the end of the farce,\" said the professor. \"Here she\r\ncomes.\"\r\n\r\nA murmur went through the hall as Therese entered. The guests rose from\r\ntheir seats to obtain a sight of her. They had known her from infancy;\r\nbut to-night she was an object of new and absorbing interest, even to\r\nthe elegant crowd, who seldom condescended to be astonished at anything.\r\n\r\nTherese seemed to feel her position, for whereas she had been accustomed\r\nto trip into the concert-room with perfect self-possession, she now came\r\ntimidly forward, with downcast eyes. The audience had always received\r\nher with enthusiasm, for she was a great artiste; but now perfect\r\nsilence greeted her entrance, for nothing was remembered, save the\r\nmarvel which her appearance there was to attest.\r\n\r\nWhether accidentally or intentionally, several chairs were in her way as\r\nshe passed to the instrument. She avoided them with perfect confidence,\r\nscarcely brushing them with the folds of her white satin dress.\r\n\r\n\"She is cured! She is no longer blind!\" murmured the spectators; and\r\nwith renewed curiosity, they watched her every motion.\r\n\r\nThere were three people within the concert-room upon whom these murmurs\r\nproduced profound and dissimilar impressions. Barth frowned angrily; Von\r\nParadies grew paler and trembled like a coward as he was; while Mesmer,\r\nwho leaned against a pillar, fixed his eyes upon Therese with a glance\r\nof supreme happiness. Therese returned the glance with one of such deep\r\ntrust and love, that no one who saw it could doubt her power of vision.\r\nThe audience burst out into one simultaneous storm of applause, and this\r\nreminded the young girl that she was not alone with her \"master.\" She\r\nraised her eyes for the first time toward the spectators, and met every\r\nglance directed toward herself.\r\n\r\nThe sight of this sea of upturned faces so terrified the poor child,\r\nthat she felt faint and dizzy. She groped about with her hands, to find\r\na seat, for she could scarcely stand.\r\n\r\nThe action attracted universal attention. A significant look passed\r\nbetween Von Paradies and Barth, while Mesmer's brow darkened, and his\r\nface flushed with disappointment. It was very unfortunate--that\r\nfaintness of Therese. She stood irresolute and alone, unable to advance,\r\nand too weak to see the chair that stood close at hand.\r\n\r\nFor some time, the audience surveyed her with breathless interest.\r\nSuddenly the silence was broken by a voice in the crowd:\r\n\r\n\"Will no one take pity upon the girl and lead her to the harpsichord? Do\r\nyou not see that she is as blind as ever?\"\r\n\r\nTherese recovered herself when she heard these insulting words, and her\r\neyes flashed strangely for eyes that could not see.\r\n\r\n\"I am not blind!\" cried she, in a clear, firm voice, and as if the sneer\r\nhad restored her strength and self-possession, she came forward at once,\r\nand took her seat.\r\n\r\nThe audience applauded a second time, and Therese bowed and smiled.\r\nWhile she drew off her gloves, she looked back at Mesmer, who returned\r\nthe glance with one of affectionate pride.\r\n\r\nScarcely knowing what she did, Therese began to play. She kept her eyes\r\nfixed upon Mesmer, and as she felt the power of his magnetic glance, she\r\nsoared into heights of harmony that ravished the ears of her listeners,\r\nand left all her previous performances far behind.\r\n\r\nShe ended with a sigh, as though awaking from some heavenly dream. Never\r\nhad she been so enthusiastically applauded as now. This time it was not\r\nher vision, but her incomparable skill which had elicited the\r\nacclamations of the public; and Therese, happy in her success, bowed,\r\nand smiled again upon her admirers.\r\n\r\nAnd now the artistic exhibition was at an end. Herr von Paradies,\r\nadvancing, informed the public that they would now proceed to test the\r\ngenuineness of his daughter's cure. He then came to the edge of the\r\nplatform, and spoke in a loud, distinct voice: \"I request the\r\ndistinguished company, who have brought books or music for the purpose,\r\nto hand them to me, that we may discover whether in truth she sees, or\r\nimagines that she sees. I beg so much the more for your attention,\r\nladies and gentlemen,\" continued he, in a faltering voice, \"that this\r\nnight is to decide a fearful doubt in my own mind. Doctor Mesmer affirms\r\nthat my daughter's vision has been restored. I, alas! believe that she\r\nis yet blind!\"\r\n\r\nThe audience expressed astonishment; Therese uttered a cry of horror,\r\nand turned to Mesmer, who, pale and stunned by the shock of her father's\r\ncruel words, had lost all power to come to the poor child's assistance.\r\n\r\nBarth was laughing behind his pocket-handkerchief. \"The remedy works,\"\r\nwhispered he to Ingenhaus--\"the remedy works.\"\r\n\r\nTwo gentlemen arose. One handed a book, the other a sheet of music. As\r\nVon Paradies turned the book over to his daughter, she gave him a\r\nreproachful look. She opened it and read: \"Emilia Galotti, by Gotthold\r\nEphraim Lessing.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, now,\" continued she, \"if one of the ladies present will select a\r\npassage, and another will look over me as I read, the audience can thus\r\nconvince themselves that I see.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most distinguished ladies in Vienna approached Therese and\r\nstood close by her side, while another, a celebrated actress, requested\r\nher to open the book at page 71.\r\n\r\nTherese turned over the leaves and found the place.\r\n\r\n\"That is right, my love,\" said the countess. \"Now read.\"\r\n\r\nTherese began to read, and when she ended, the excitement of the people\r\nknew no bounds.\r\n\r\n\"She sees! She sees!\" cried the people. \"Who can doubt it?\"\r\n\r\nAnd now from the crowd arose a voice:\r\n\r\n\"We have enough proof. The fact is self-evident, and we may all\r\ncongratulate the fraulein upon the recovery of her sight. Let us have\r\nmore of her delightful music.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry that I cannot agree with Doctor Mesmer's invisible patron,\"\r\nsaid Von Paradies. \"I strive to forget that I am her father, and place\r\nmyself on the side of the incredulous public, who have a right to demand\r\nwhether indeed the days of miracles have returned.\"\r\n\r\n\"My remedy does wonders,\" said Barth to the faculty.\r\n\r\nHerr von Paradies continued: \"This being the case, it is easier for us\r\nto suppose that the distinguished actress, who selected the page, has\r\nbeen requested to do so, than to believe that my daughter has seen the\r\nwords just read; for this lady is known to be a follower of Doctor\r\nMesmer. Perhaps the countess did not remark that the corner of the leaf\r\nis slightly turned down.\"\r\n\r\nHe took the book and passed the leaves rapidly over his thumb.\r\n\r\n\"Here it is,\" said he, holding it up.\r\n\r\n\"Father!\" exclaimed Therese, indignantly, \"I saw you turn the leaf a few\r\nminutes ago with your own hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"SAW\" cried Von Paradies, raising his hands. Then turning to the\r\naudience, he continued: \"As regards this book, it was handed to me just\r\nnow by Baron von Horka, one of Mesmer's most devoted adherents. He may\r\nhave been commissioned to select this particular work, and Therese may\r\nbe aware of it. If I am thus stringent in my acceptance of the evidence\r\nin this case, it is because I long to possess the sweet assurance of my\r\ndear child's complete cure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear him,\" laughed Barth, touching Ingenhaus on the elbow.\r\n\r\nTherese, meanwhile, was growing embarrassed; and, looking to Mesmer for\r\nencouragement she lost sight of every thing under the influence of his\r\neyes. Her father held the paper before her, but she was not aware of it.\r\nThe audience whispered, but Mesmer at that moment, turning away from\r\nTherese, she sighed, and, recovering her self-possession, took the paper\r\nand placed it before the harpsichord.\r\n\r\n\"March, from 'OEdipus,'\" said she, seating herself before the\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Therese,\" cried her father, \"you read the title without turning to\r\nthe title-page.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw the piece when it was handed to you by Ritter Gluck.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are acquainted with Gluck?\" asked Von Paradies. \"He has never been\r\nto our house.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have seen him at Doctor Mesmer's,\" replied Therese.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, indeed! Ritter Gluck, who hands the music, is like Baron von Horka,\r\nwho brought the book, a friend of Mesmer's,\" said Von Paradies, with a\r\nsneer that affrighted his daughter and made her tremble.\r\n\r\nBut she placed her hands upon the keys and began to play.\r\n\r\nThe enraptured audience again forgot her eyes, and, entranced by the\r\nmusic, hung breathless upon her notes, while she executed the\r\nmagnificent funeral march in \"OEdipus.\" Suddenly, at the conclusion of a\r\npassage of exquisite beauty, she ceased, and her hands wandered feebly\r\nover the keys, Her father, who was turning the leaves, looked almost\r\nscornfully at the poor girl; who, alarmed and bewildered by his\r\nunaccountable conduct, grew deadly pale, and finally, with a deep sigh,\r\nclosed her eyes.\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments she began again. From her agile fingers dropped\r\nshowers of pearly notes, while, through all the fanciful combinations of\r\nsound, was beard the solemn and majestic chant of the funeral march. The\r\naudience could scarcely contain their raptures; and yet they dared not\r\napplaud for fear of losing a note.\r\n\r\nShe seemed to be astray in a wilderness of harmony, when her father,\r\nwith an impatient gesture, laid his hands upon her fingers and held them\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\"You are no longer playing by note!\" exclaimed he, with affected\r\nsurprise. \"You are giving us voluntaries from 'Orpheus,' instead of the\r\nfuneral march. I appeal to the public to say whether my daughter is\r\nplaying the funeral march?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, then a voice, tremulous with emotion, said, \"No, it\r\nis no longer the funeral march; it is now a beautiful arrangement from\r\n'Orpheus.'\"\r\n\r\nHerr von Paradies, with an expression of profoundest anguish, threw his\r\narm around his daughter, exclaiming, \"Oh, my beloved child, it is then\r\nas I feared! We have been deceived, and you are blind for life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Father!\" screamed Therese, flinging him off; \"father, you know--\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that you are blind,\" cried he, following her, and again clasping\r\nher in his arms. \"Come, my poor child, come, and fear nothing! Your\r\nfather will work for you; and his hand shall guide your faltering steps.\r\nOh, my child! May God forgive those who have brought this bitter\r\ndisappointment upon my head! My dream of hope is over. You are blind,\r\nTherese, hopelessly blind, and your father's heart is broken!\"\r\n\r\nThe audience were deeply moved by this outburst of paternal grief and\r\ntenderness. Here and there were heard half-audible murmurs of sympathy,\r\nand many of the ladies had their handkerchiefs to their eyes. Everybody\r\nwas touched except Professor Barth. He, on the contrary, was chuckling\r\nwith satisfaction, and felt much more inclined to applaud than to\r\ncommiserate. He looked at Ingenhaus, who, not being in the secret, was\r\ndivided between sympathy for the father and indignation toward the\r\ncharlatan. Indeed, he had so far forgotten his own interest in the\r\nscene, that he was weeping with the rest.\r\n\r\n\"Console yourself, my friend,\" said Barth, \"all this is the result of my\r\nefforts in behalf of science. I deserve a public vote of thanks for\r\nhaving out-mesmered Mesmer.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped--for Therese's voice was heard in open strife with her\r\nfather. \"Let me go!\" cried she, with passion. \"I am not blind. As God\r\nhears me, I see--but oh, how fearful have been the revelations that\r\nsight has made to me this night!\"\r\n\r\nPoor, poor Therese! The shock of her father's treachery had proved too\r\ngreat for her girlish frame. She reeled and fell back insensible in his\r\narms.\r\n\r\nVon Paradies, with simulated anguish, turned to the audience and bowed\r\nhis stricken head. Then raising his daughter in his arms, he carried her\r\naway from the stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCII.\r\n\r\nTHE CATASTROPHE.\r\n\r\nTherese lay for several hours unconscious, while her mother wept, and\r\nwatched over her, and her father stood by, sullenly awaiting the result.\r\n\r\nAt last she heaved a sigh and opened her eyes. \"Where am I?\" asked she,\r\nfeebly.\r\n\r\n\"At home, darling,\" replied the tender mother, bending over and kissing\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"No--I am in the fearful concert-room. They stare at me with those\r\npiercing daggers which men call eyes; and oh, their glances hurt me,\r\nmother! There they sit, heartlessly applauding my misery, because it has\r\nshaped itself into music! Let me go; I am strong, and I SEE!\"\r\n\r\nShe attempted to rise, but her father held her back. \"Lie still, my\r\nchild,\" said he, reproachfully; \"it is in vain for you to carry this\r\ndeception further. Trust your parents, and confess that you are blind.\r\nWere it otherwise, you would not mistake your own familiar chamber for\r\nthe vast concert-room. For Mesmer's sake, you have sought to deceive us,\r\nbut it is useless, for we know that you are blind.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are blind--you are blind!\" These oft-repeated words seemed fraught\r\nwith a power that almost made her doubt her own senses. She saw, and yet\r\nshe felt as if sight were receding from her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my God! Why will my father madden me!\" cried the unhappy girl,\r\nrising in spite of all efforts to detain her, and looking around the\r\nroom. \"Ah--now I remember, I fainted and was brought home. Yes, father,\r\nyes, I tell you that I see,\" cried she, wringing her hands, and writhing\r\nwith the agony he was inflicting upon her. \"I see in the window the blue\r\nflower-pot which Mesmer brought me yesterday--there opposite stands my\r\nharpsichord, and its black and white keys are beckoning me to come and\r\ncaress them. Two open books lie upon the table, and over it are\r\nscattered drawings and engravings. Oh, father, have I not described\r\nthings as they are?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, child--you have long been familiar with this room, and need not\r\nthe help of eyes to describe it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then,\" continued she, \"I see you both. I see my mother's dear face,\r\ntender as it was when first my eyes opened to the light of its love;\r\nand, my father, I see you with the same frown that terrified me in the\r\nconcert-room--the same scowl that to my frightened fancy, seemed that of\r\nsome mocking fiend who sought to drive me back to blindness! What is it,\r\nfather? What has changed you so that you love your child no longer, and\r\nseek to take the new life that God has just bestowed?\"\r\n\r\n\"God has bestowed nothing upon you, and I will no longer be the tool of\r\nan impostor,\" replied he, morosely. \"Am I to be the laughing-stock of\r\nVienna, while men of distinction see through the tricks of the\r\ncharlatan? I must and will have the strength to confess my folly, and to\r\nadmit that you are blind.\"\r\n\r\nTherese uttered a cry, and shook as though a chill had seized her. \"O\r\nGod, help me!\" murmured the poor girl, sinking in her mother's\r\noutstretched arms, and weeping piteously. Suddenly she raised her head\r\nand gradually her face brightened, her cheeks flushed, her lips parted\r\nwith a smile, and her large expressive eyes beamed with happiness. Once\r\nmore she trembled--but with joy, and leaning her head upon her mother's\r\nshoulder, she whispered, \"He comes.\"\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and Mesmer's tall and commanding figure advanced toward\r\nthe group. Therese flew to meet him and grasped his hands in hers.\r\n\r\n\"Come, master, come and shield me! God be thanked, you are here to\r\nshelter me. If you leave again, I shall lose my sight.\"\r\n\r\nHe passed his hands lightly over her face, and looked earnestly into her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"You are dissatisfied with me, master,\" said she anxiously. \"You are\r\ndispleased at my childish behavior. I know that I was silly; but when I\r\nsaw those multitudinous heads so close together, all with eyes that were\r\nfixed on me alone, I began again to feel afraid of my own race. It\r\nseemed as if the walls were advancing to meet me--and I retreated in\r\nterror.\"\r\n\r\n\"What confused you at the harpsichord, child?\"\r\n\r\n\"The sight of the small, dazzling notes, and the singular motions of my\r\nown fingers. I am so unaccustomed to see, that hands and notes appeared\r\nto be dancing a mad Morrisco, until at last I grew confused and saw\r\nnothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"All this is so natural,\" said Mesmer sadly, \"for the seat of your\r\ninfirmity lay in the nerves. And now that they require rest, you are a\r\nprey to agitation and to tears. Unhappy Therese, there are some who seek\r\nto plunge you back into the darkness from whence I have rescued you!\"\r\n\r\nShe put her arms upon his shoulders and sobbed, \"Save me, master, save\r\nme--I could not bear blindness now!\"\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the room stood Von Paradies and his wife. She laid\r\nher hand upon his arm, saying imploringly:\r\n\r\n\"What signifies all this mystery, husband? Why do you torture our little\r\nTherese so cruelly? You know that she sees; why, then, do you--\"\r\n\r\n\"Peace!\" interrupted Von Paradies angrily. \"If Therese does not become\r\nblind again, we shall lose our pension.\"\r\n\r\n\"My poor child,\" sobbed the mother, \"you are lost!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have come to your help, Therese,\" said Mesmer audibly. \"I know all\r\nthat is passing under this roof,\" continued he, with a look of scorn at\r\nher parents. \"They are trying to deprive you of your sight, and they\r\nwell know that excitement and weeping will destroy it. But my name and\r\nhonor are linked with your fortunes, child; and I shall struggle for\r\nboth. I have come to take you to the villa, with my other patients. You\r\nshall be under my wife's care, and will remain with us until your eyes\r\nare fortified against nervous impressions. The carriage is at the door.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am ready to go,\" replied Therese joyfully.\r\n\r\n\"I will not suffer her to leave the house!\" cried Von Paradies, striding\r\nangrily forward. \"Therese is my daughter, and shall not be torn from her\r\nfather's protection.\"\r\n\r\n\"She goes with me,\" thundered Mesmer with eyes that flashed lightning,\r\nlike those of Olympian Zeus. \"You gave her to me as a patient, and until\r\nshe is cured she belongs to her physician.\"\r\n\r\nHe took Therese in his arms and carried her toward the door. But Von\r\nParadies, with a roar like that of some wild animal, placed himself\r\nbefore it and defended the passage.\r\n\r\n\"Let me pass,\" cried he.\r\n\r\n\"Go--but first put down Therese.\"\r\n\r\n\"No--you shall not deprive her of the sight I have bestowed.\" With these\r\nwords, he raised his muscular right arm, and swinging off Von Paradies\r\nas if he had been a child, Mesmer passed the opening and stood outside.\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, and fear nothing,\" cried he, \"for your pension will not be\r\nwithdrawn. Therese is once more blind. But as God is just, I will\r\nrestore her again to sight!\"\r\n\r\nMesmer, however, was destined to be foiled. His enemies were richer and\r\nmore influential than he; and Von Paradies, in mortal terror for his\r\npension, sustained them. Von Stork obtained an order, commanding the\r\nrelinquishment of Therese to her natural guarians; and her father, armed\r\nwith the document, went and demanded his daughter. Therese flew to\r\nMesmer's arms, and a fearful scene ensued. It shall be described in\r\nMesmer's own words.\r\n\r\n\"The father of Therese, resolved to carry her away by main force, rushed\r\nupon me with an unsheathed sword. I succeeded in disarming him, but the\r\nmother and daughter both fell insensible at my feet: the former from\r\nterror, the latter because her unnatural father had hurled her against\r\nthe wall, where she had struck her head with such violence as to lose\r\nall consciousness. Madame von Paradies recovered and went home; but poor\r\nTherese was in a state of such nervous agony that she lost her sight\r\nentirely. I trembled for her life and reason. Having no desire to\r\nrevenge myself upon her parents, I did all that I could to save her.\r\nHerr von Paradies, sustained by those who had instigated him, filled\r\nVienna with the cry of persecution. I became an object of universal\r\ncontumely, and a second order was obtained by which I was commanded to\r\ndeliver Therese to her father.\" [Footnote: Justinus Kerner, \"Fraaz Anton\r\nMesmer,\" p.70.]\r\n\r\nFrom this time Therese remained blind, and continued to give concerts in\r\nVienna, as she had done before. Barth and his accomplices were\r\ntriumphant; and Mesmer, disgusted with his countrymen, left Vienna, and\r\nmade his home in Paris.\r\n\r\nTherese von Paradies then, as her father asserted, was blind. Whether\r\nshe ever was any thing else, remains to this day an open question. The\r\nfaculty denied furiously that she had seen; Mesmer's friends, on the\r\ncontrary, declared solemnly that she had been restored by animal\r\nmagnetism; but that her cruel father, for the sake of the pension, had\r\npersecuted her, and so succeeded in destroying her eyesight forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIE ANTOINETTE\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCIII.\r\n\r\nLE ROI EST MORT, VIVE LE ROI!\r\n\r\nIt was the evening of the tenth of May, 1774. The palace of Versailles,\r\nthe seat of royal splendor, was gloomy, silent, and empty. Regality,\r\nerst so pleasure-loving and voluptuous, now lay with crown all dim, and\r\npurple all stained, awaiting the last sigh of an old, expiring king,\r\nwhose demise was to restore to it an inheritance of youth, beauty, and\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nIn one wing of the palace royalty hovered over a youthful pair, as the\r\ngenius of hope; in another it frowned upon the weak old king as the\r\nimplacable angel of death.\r\n\r\nLouis the Fifteenth was balancing the great account of his life--a life\r\nof luxury, voluptuousness, and supreme selfishness. Yielding to the\r\nentreaties of his daughters, he had sent for the Archbishop of Paris;\r\nbut knowing perfectly well that the sacraments of the church would not\r\nbe administered under a roof which was polluted by the presence of Du\r\nBarry, the old libertine had banished her to the Chateau de Ruelles.\r\n\r\nBut Monseigneur de Beaumontr required something more than this of the\r\nroyal sinner. He exacted that he should make public confession of his\r\nscandalous life in presence of the court to which he had given such\r\nshameful example. The king had struggled against such open humiliation,\r\nbut the archbishop was firm, and the fear of death predominating over\r\npride, Louis consented to make the sacrifice.\r\n\r\nFor three days the courtiers had hung about the anteroom, afraid to\r\nenter (for the king's disease was small-pox), yet afraid to take flight,\r\nlest by some chance he should recover. But now the doors of the royal\r\napartments were flung wide open, and there was great trepidation among\r\nthe crowd. The archbishop in his canonicals was seen standing by the bed\r\nof state; on one side of him stood the grand almoner, and on the other\r\nthe minister, the Duke d'Aiguillon. At the foot of the bed knelt the\r\ndaughters of the king, who in soft whispers were trying to comfort their\r\nmiserable father.\r\n\r\n\"The king wishes to bid adieu to his friends!\" cried the Duke\r\nd'Aiguillon, in a loud voice.\r\n\r\nHere was a dilemma! Everybody was afraid of the small-pox, for the\r\nhandsome Marquis de Letorieres, whom Louis had insisted upon seeing, had\r\njust died of the infection, and nobody desired to follow him. And yet\r\nthe king might outlive this attack, and then--what?\r\n\r\nOnce more the Duke d'Aiguillon called out for the king's friends; and,\r\ntrembling from apprehension of results that might follow this latter\r\ncontingency, they entered the chamber of death. The atmosphere was\r\nfearful. Not all the fumes of the incense which was sending its vapory\r\nwreaths to the pictured ceilings could overpower the odor of approaching\r\ndissolution. In vain the acolytes swung their golden censers--death was\r\nthere, and the scent of the grave.\r\n\r\nBreathless and with compressed lips the king's friends listened to his\r\nindistinct mutterings, and looked upon his swollen, livid, blackened\r\nface. Each one had hurried by, and now they all were free again, and\r\nwere preparing to fly as far as possible from the infected spot. But the\r\nclear, solemn voice of the archbishop--that voice which so often had\r\nstricken terror to their worldly hearts--was heard again, and he bade\r\nthem stay.\r\n\r\n\"The king asks pardon of his subjects for the wicked and scandalous life\r\nwhich he has led on earth,\" said the archbishop. \"Although as a man he\r\nis responsible to God alone for his deeds, as a sovereign he\r\nacknowledges to his subjects that he heartily repents of his wickedness,\r\nand desires to live only that he may do penance for the past and make\r\namends for the future.\"\r\n\r\nA piteous groan escaped from the lips of the dying monarch, but his\r\n\"friends\" did not stay to hear it; they fled precipitately from the\r\nfrightful scene.\r\n\r\nWhile here a trembling soul was being driven from its earthly dwelling,\r\nin another wing of the palace the other members of the royal family were\r\nin the chapel at prayer. The evening services were over, and the\r\nchaplain was reading the \"forty hours' prayer,\" when the sky became\r\nsuddenly obscured, peal upon peal of thunder resounded along the\r\nheavens, and night enveloped the chapel in its dismal pall of black.\r\nLivid flashes of lightning lit up the pale faces of the royal\r\nsupplicants, while to every faltering prayer that fell from their lips\r\nthe answer came from above in the roar of the angry thunder-clap.\r\n\r\nThere, before the altar, knelt the doomed pair, the innocent heirs of a\r\nselfish and luxurious race of kings; whose sins were to be visited upon\r\ntheir unconscious heads. No wonder they wept--no wonder they shuddered\r\non the dark and stormy night which heralded their reign.\r\n\r\nThe rites were ended, and the dauphin and dauphiness went silently\r\ntogether to their apartments. The few trusty attendants who were\r\ngathered in the anteroom greeted them with faint smiles, and uttered\r\nsilent orisons in their behalf; for who could help compassionating these\r\ntwo young creatures, upon whose inexperienced heads the thorny crown of\r\nroyalty was so soon to be placed?\r\n\r\nAs they entered the door, a flash of lightning; that seemed like the\r\nfire which smote the guilty cities of Israel, flashed athwart their\r\npaths, and the thunder cracked and rattled above the roof as though it\r\nhad been riving that palace-dome asunder. The dauphiness cried out, and\r\nclung to her husband's arm. He, scarcely less appalled, stood motionless\r\non the threshold.\r\n\r\nThe violence of the wind at that moment had burst open some outer door.\r\nThe lights in the chandeliers were almost extinguished, and one solitary\r\nwax-light, that had been burning in the recess of a window, went\r\nentirely out. Regardless of etiquette, and of the presence of the royal\r\npair, Monsieur de Campan sprang to the chandelier, and, relighting the\r\ncandle, quickly replaced it in the window.\r\n\r\nThe dauphin beheld the act with astonishment, for no one at that court\r\nwas more observant of decorum than Monsieur de Campan.\r\n\r\n\"What means that light in the window?\" inquired the dauphin, in his\r\nclear, touching voice.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your highness, it is merely a ceremony,\" replied Monsieur de\r\nCampan, confused.\r\n\r\n\"What ceremony?\" asked the dauphin, with surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Your highness commands me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I request you--if the dauphiness permits,\" said Louis, turning to his\r\nwife, who, almost exhausted, leaned for support against him, and bowed\r\nher head.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty has given orders, that as soon as the event, which is\r\nabout to take place, has occurred, the whole court shall leave\r\nVersailles for Choisy. Now it would not be possible to issue verbal\r\norders in such a moment as the one which we await; so that the master of\r\nthe horse and myself had agreed upon a signal by which the matter could\r\nbe arranged without speech. The garden du corps, pages, equerries,\r\ncoaches, coachmen, and outriders, are all assembled in the court-yard,\r\ntheir eyes fixed upon this light. As soon as it is extinguished, it will\r\nbe understood that the moment has arrived when the court is to leave\r\nVersailles.\"\r\n\r\n\"The disappearance of the light, then, will communicate the tidings of\r\nthe king's death?\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Campan bowed. Louis drew his wife hurriedly forward, and\r\npassed into another room, where, with his hands folded behind him, he\r\nwalked to and fro.\r\n\r\n\"God is just,\" murmured he to himself, \"and there is retribution in\r\nheaven.\"\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette, whose large violet eyes had followed her husband's\r\nmotions, raised them to his face with a look of inquiry. She rose from\r\nthe divan on which she was sitting, and putting her small, white hand\r\nupon the dauphin's shoulder, said:\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Louis?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean that this solitary light, for whose disappearance these people\r\nare waiting, shines in retribution for the fearful death-bed of my\r\nfather.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Antoinette, how should you? You have never heard the tragic story\r\nof my father's death, have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my husband,\" said she, tenderly; \"tell it to me now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, Antoinette. He was one of the best and truest hearts that ever\r\nlived; and yet these selfish courtiers all forsook him in his dying\r\nhour. He lay alone and abandoned in his room by all save my angelic\r\nmother, who nursed him as loving woman alone can nurse. The court was at\r\nFontainebleau, and the dauphin's father announced that as soon as his\r\nson had expired, they would all journey to Choisy. My father, who in an\r\narm-chair, was inhaling, for the last time, the balmy breath of spring,\r\nsaw these hurried preparations for departure from the open window where\r\nhe sat. He saw carriages, horses, trunks, lackeys, and equerries ready\r\nat a moment's warning to move. He saw that the signal for the rushing\r\ncrowd to depart was to be his death. Turning to his physician, he said,\r\nwith a sad smile, 'I must not be too long in dying, for these people are\r\nbecoming impatient.'\" [Footnote: Soulavie, \"Memoires,\" etc., vol. i.]\r\n\r\n\"Shameful!\" cried Marie Antoinette, wiping away her tears.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, more than shameful!\" exclaimed Louis. \"Now, you see, that the hour\r\nof retribution has come, for once more the court grows impatient with\r\nthe length of a dying sovereign's agony. Oh, would that my noble father\r\nwere alive! How much more worthy was he to be a king than I.\"\r\n\r\n\"From my heart I echo your wish,\" said Antoinette, fervently. \"How was\r\nit that he died so young?\"\r\n\r\nLouis looked searchingly at the face of his young wife. \"He died of a\r\nmalady whose name is an impeachment of the honor of those who survive\r\nhim,\" said the dauphin, sternly, \"and my mother died of the same\r\ndisease. [Footnote: It was generally believed that the dauphin and his\r\nwife were poisoned by a political party, whose leader was the Duke de\r\nChoiseul. The royal couple belonged to the anti-Austrian party.\r\n\"Memoires de Campan,\" vol. i., p. 78.] But let us not throw any darker\r\nshadows over the gloom of this heavy hour. I am stifled--I have a\r\npresentiment of--\" A loud shout interrupted the dauphin. It came nearer\r\nand nearer, and now it reached the anteroom, where the crowding\r\ncourtiers were pouring in to greet King Louis XVI.\r\n\r\nThe dauphin and his wife were at no loss to understand these shouts.\r\nThey exchanged glances of fear, and side by side they fell upon their\r\nknees while, with tear-streaming eyes, they faltered. \"O God have mercy\r\nupon us, we are so young to reign!\" [Footnote: \"Memoires de Campan,\"\r\nvol. i., p. 78.]\r\n\r\nThe doors were thrown open, and the mistress of ceremonies of Marie\r\nAntoinette appeared. Behind her came a multitude of lords and ladies,\r\ntheir curious eyes peering at what they had never expected to see--a\r\nroyal couple assuming the purple, not with pomp and pride, but with\r\nhumility, distrust, and prayer.\r\n\r\nThey rose, and faced their subjects. Madame de Noailles courtesied so\r\nlow that she was upon her knees.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesties will forgive this intrusion,\" said she, with all the\r\naplomb of her dignity. \"I come to request that your majesties will\r\nrepair to the state reception-room to receive the congratulations of\r\nyour royal relatives, and those of your court, who are all waiting\r\nanxiously to do you homage.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a request, from the lips of Madame de Noailles, was the exaction of\r\nan indispensable form of court-etiquette, which the young couple dared\r\nnot evade.\r\n\r\nArm in arm they went, Marie Antoinette hiding her tears with her\r\nhandkerchief, and looking inexpressibly lovely in her childish emotions,\r\nwhile the loud greetings of a magnificent court hailed her as their\r\nqueen.\r\n\r\nWhile the consorts of the royal princes folded their sister-in-law in\r\ntheir arms, the princes, with courtly decorum, bowed ceremoniously\r\nbefore the king.\r\n\r\n\"Permit us, sire,\" began the Count of Provence, \"to be the first to lay\r\nour homage at your majesty's feet, and to--\"\r\n\r\n\"My brothers, my brothers!\" cried Louis, deeply affected, \"is my crown\r\nto rob me of the dear ties of kindred? Oh, do not call me king, for I\r\ncannot afford to lose the dear companions of my childhood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" replied the Count of Provence, \"you shall not lose them; and for\r\nus, our gain is two-fold. We receive from God a gracious king, and\r\nretain our much-loved brother.\" And the count embraced the king, who had\r\nopened his arms to receive him.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour later, the chateau of Versailles was deserted. The\r\ncourtiers, pages, equerries, and lackeys, had all departed, delighted to\r\nleave that infected atmosphere within whose poisonous influence the iron\r\nrules of etiquette had detained them while Louis XV. lived. None of them\r\nfelt inclined to do homage to departed royalty. Even the Duke de\r\nVillequier, first gentleman of the bed-chamber, in his terror, forgot\r\netiquette; and instead of watching the king's corpse, he, too, made\r\nready to go with the rest.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur,\" said the duke to Andouille, the king's physician, \"I leave\r\nyou that you may be able to open and embalm the body.\" Andouille grew\r\npale, for he knew perfectly well that the performance of such a ceremony\r\nas that, was his death-warrant. However, after a pause, he replied, \"I\r\nam ready, your grace, but you must remain to hold the king's head. It\r\nis, as you know, a part of your duty as gentleman of the bedchamber.\"\r\n[Footnote: Campan, vol. i., p. 79]\r\n\r\nThe Duke de Villequier said nothing. He merely bowed and hurried from\r\nthe room. Andouille followed his example, but, more considerate than the\r\nother attendants of the king, he made some provision for the deserted\r\ncorpse. He sent for one of the subordinates of the palace, and ordered\r\nhim to watch by the body. Then, going to his carriage, he saw several\r\nhodmen lounging about, who were carrying mortar for some repairs that\r\nwere being made at the palace. The physician called them, and bade them\r\ngo tell the lord-Steward that the king's coffin must be saturated with\r\nspirits of wine, and his winding-sheet also.\r\n\r\nSuch were the preparations that were made for the obsequies of the\r\ndefunct king; and his body was watched by a few servants and these\r\nhodmen whom Andouille had employed as messengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCIV.\r\n\r\nTHE MEMORANDA.\r\n\r\nIt was early in the morning. The court had accompanied the king and\r\nqueen to Choisy, and thither had flocked the representatives of every\r\nclass in Paris, to do homage to the king and wish him a prosperous\r\nreign.\r\n\r\nThe people seemed wild with joy, and nobody vouchsafed a thought to the\r\nmemory of the \"Bien-aime,\" whose body was even now being taken to its\r\nlast rest, in the vaults of St. Denis. The funeral train was any thing\r\nbut imposing. The coffin, placed upon a large hunting-wagon, was\r\nfollowed by two carriages, containing the Duke d'Ayen, the Duke\r\nd'Aumont, and two priests. Twenty pages and as many grooms closed the\r\nprocession, which went along without attracting the notice of anybody.\r\nThe burial-service was read in the crypt, and the coffin hastily lowered\r\nin the vault, which was not only walled up, but cemented also, for fear\r\nthe infection imprisoned within might escape from the dungeon of the\r\ndead and infest the abodes of the living.\r\n\r\nNot one of the royal family had followed the body. The king was at\r\nChoisy, and all hearts were turned to him. Thousands of men went in and\r\nout of the palace, each one with his burden of fears, hopes, uneasiness\r\nor expectations. Who was now to find favor at court! Would it be the\r\nqueen, or the aunts of the king? What fate awaited Du Barry? Who would\r\nbe prime minister?\r\n\r\nWhile these matters were being discussed without, the king, who had not\r\nyet made his appearance, was in his cabinet. His disordered mien,\r\ntangled hair, and red eyes, as well as the lights that still flickered\r\nin the chaneliers, showed plainly that he had not been to bed that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nHe could not sleep. The future lowered dark and threatening before him,\r\nand day had not brought comfort to his anxious mind. Great drops of\r\nsweat stood upon his brow, and his face, never at the best of tunes\r\nhandsome, to-day was less attractive than ever. \"I am so young!\" thought\r\nhe, despondently. \"I know of no man at this court, in whose honesty I\r\ncan confide. Every man of them has curried favor with that shameless\r\nwoman whose presence has defiled the throne of my ancestors, and\r\ndisgraced the declining years of my grandfather. To whom shall I turn?\r\nWho will give counsel to a poor, inexperienced youth?\"\r\n\r\nA slight knock was heard at the door. The king rose and opened it.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur de Nicolai,\" said Louis, surprised, as the old man stood.\r\nbefore him with head inclined. \"What brings you to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"The will of your deceased father, sire.\"\r\n\r\nThe king stepped back and motioned him to enter. \"Now speak,\" said he.\r\n\"I know that you were with my father on his death-bed; and I have often\r\nsought to win your friendship, but until now leave sought in vain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, I was afraid that if I betrayed an interest in your majesty, I\r\nmight not be allowed to live long enough to fulfil the trust confided to\r\nme by your father. I had sworn that on the day you ascended the throne\r\nof France I would deliver his will to your majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you have preserved it? You have brought it to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, here it is,\" said the old nobleman, taking from his breast a\r\nsealed package, and laying it in the king's hands.\r\n\r\nLouis grasped it eagerly, and deeply moved, read the address \"Papers to\r\nbe delivered to whichever one of my sons ascends the throne of France.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty sees that I have kept my trust,\" said De Nicolai.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, why is not my father here to reign in my stead!\" exclaimed Louis.\r\n\r\n\"He died, sire, that he might be spared the sight of the disgrace which\r\nhas overtaken France. He died that the world might bear witness to the\r\nbaseness of those who, since his death, have swayed the destinies of\r\nFrance. He did not die in vain. Your majesty's self will profit by his\r\nmartyrdom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have heard of it all. I know the invisible hand that dealt the\r\ndeath-blow to my father, my mother, and my grand-mother. I know it,\r\nand--\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, your majesty's father forgave his enemies; and, through me, he\r\nprays your majesty to do likewise.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will obey,\" said Louis, inclining his head, \"and leave the guilty to\r\nthe vengeance of Heaven. \"\r\n\r\n\"And now, sire, that my mission is accomplished, allow me to retire, and\r\nlet me entreat you to lay your father's words to heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do so, I promise you. Can I do aught to serve you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty, I have nothing to ask of man.\"\r\n\r\nThe king gave him his hand, and followed him with wistful eyes until the\r\ndoor had closed behind him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how beggared seems a king, when he has nothing wherewith to\r\nrecognize the loyalty and love of his friends!\" thought Louis, with a\r\nweary sigh.\r\n\r\nHe took up the packet and read: \"Treaty concluded between Louis XV. and\r\nMaria Theresa, on the 1st of May, 1756. Arguments to prove that, sooner\r\nor later, the Austrian alliance will be an injury to France.\"\r\n\r\nThe king turned over the pages and read the following:\r\n\r\n\"Whichever one of my sons is called to the throne of Louis XV. let him\r\nhearken to the warning of his father. Beware, my son, of entanglements\r\nwith Austria. Never seek the hand of an Austrian princess; for marriages\r\nwith Austria have brought no blessing to France.\"\r\n\r\nThe king sighed heavily, and his head sank upon his breast. \"Too\r\nlate--too late, my father! My fate is decided!\" And Louis took up the\r\nsecond memorandum.\r\n\r\n\"List of persons whom I recommend to my son, the King of France.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!--this is the guide I was seeking. Let me see. First,--`Monsieur de\r\nMaurepas--a statesman who has steadily opposed the policy advocated by\r\nLa Pompadour.' That is well--I shall recall him from banishment.\r\n'Messieurs de Machault, de Nivernois, de Muy Perigord, de Broglie,\r\nd'Estaing, and others--all men of honor.' How far-sighted was my father,\r\nin recommending these men! They are the very nobles who have kept aloof\r\nfrom the late king's mistresses. With one exception, I adopt the list;\r\nbut there is one among them, who stooped to be a flatterer of Du Barry.\r\nThe Duke d'Aiguillon is certainly a statesman, but he cannot be of my\r\nministry.\"\r\n\r\nHere the king paused, perplexed to know who should be appointed in\r\nD'Aiguillon's place. Suddenly his face brightened, and he rose from his\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\"Marie Antoinette,\" thought he, \"I will advise with her. Though we may\r\nnot love one another, we are friendly; and she has a right to my\r\nconfidence. Besides, she is intelligent and principled.\"\r\n\r\nHere the king took up his memoranda, and prepared to seek his wife. He\r\nhad gotten as far as the door, when his expression changed again, and\r\nhis face once more wore a look of blank despondency. With a grieved and\r\nperplexed mind, he returned to the table.\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" sighed he, falling back into his chair, \"that will never do.\r\nShe is an Austrian; and her policy would be in direct opposition to that\r\nof my father.\"\r\n\r\nFor some time the poor young king sat in profound discouragement.\r\nFinally, with a long, weary sigh, he raised his head, and began to\r\nreflect again. At last he solved he difficult problem. \"Ah!--I have it\r\nnow,\" thought he, heartily relieved. \"I will go to Madame Adelaide. She\r\nwas my mother's dearest friend and my father's favorite sister. She\r\nshall be my counsellor. I believe that, with her assistance, I may\r\nsucceed in carrying out the policy dictated by my father.\"\r\n\r\nHe gathered up his papers, and went into the anteroom, where he ordered\r\na page to go to Madame Adelaide, and say that the king would visit her\r\nif she could conveniently receive him. [Footnote: Madame Adelaide, an\r\nanti-Austrian, and, therefore, one of the queen's enemies was,\r\nthroughout his whole reign, the counsellor of her nephew.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCV.\r\n\r\nFRANCE AND AUSTRIA.\r\n\r\nWhile the king was closeted with Madame Adelaide, the queen, on her\r\nside, was receiving her royal household. This ceremony over, she had\r\ngladly retired to the privacy of her own room, there to restore order to\r\nher confused mind.\r\n\r\nBut her rest was not of long duration, for presently came Monsieur de\r\nCampan to announce the visit of the Austrian ambassador.\r\n\r\nThe queen received him most cordially, rising from her seat, and\r\nadvancing a few steps to meet him. Madame de Noailles, who, conforming\r\nto etiquette, had entered with Monsieur de Campan, and was to remain in\r\nthe room during the interview, was shocked at the queen, and frowned\r\nvisibly.\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette paid no attention to her. She reached her hand to Count\r\nvon Mercy, and allowed him to press it to his lips.\r\n\r\nAgain Madame de Noailles was horror-stricken. The kissing of the queen's\r\nhand was a state ceremonial, and was inadmissible in private.\r\n\r\nThe queen had forgotten the existence of her mistress of ceremonies.\r\nWith sparkling eyes and beaming smiles she greeted the old count, who,\r\nto her, was the representative of all that she loved--her mother, her\r\nsisters, and her native country.\r\n\r\n\"Have you news for me from Vienna, count?\" said she, in a voice whose\r\ntones were strikingly like those of her mother.\r\n\r\n\"I bring to your majesty letters of condolence and of congratulation\r\nfrom the empress and the emperor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you must be a conjurer, count. Our reign is not twenty-four hours\r\nold yet, and you bring us congratulations from Vienna?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will explain, your majesty,\" said the old count, with a smile. \"You\r\nremember, that more than a week ago the king lay in a stupor, which, for\r\nsome hours, was supposed to be death. During his stupor, my courier\r\nstarted for Vienna, and the messenger sent after him, to stop the\r\ndispatches, arrived too late. The answers had been sent, and there are\r\nthe congratulatory letters.\"\r\n\r\nThe count handed his papers, and as the queen cast down her beautiful\r\neyes to read the address, she exclaimed, joyfully:\r\n\r\n\"My mother's handwriting and my brother's!\"\r\n\r\nShe broke the seal of the empress's letter, and her countenance fell.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but official papers,\" said she, sighing and putting them on the\r\ntable. \"I know the contents of Joseph's letter without reading it. Have\r\nyou no news for me from Vienna? Think of something to tell me from home,\r\ndear count.\"\r\n\r\nCount von Mercy cast a stolen glance at the mistress of ceremonies, who,\r\nstiff and watchful, stood close by the side of the queen's chair. Marie\r\nAntoinette understood the look.\r\n\r\n\"Madame de Noailles\" said she, turning with a smile to address her, \"you\r\nwill not, I hope, think me rude, if I request you to allow me a few\r\nmoments interview with Count von Mercy. He has something to say to me\r\nthat is of a strictly confidential nature.\"\r\n\r\nThe mistress of ceremonies did not appear to have heard a word of this\r\naddress. Marie Antoinette reddened, and threw back her head.\r\n\r\n\"I request Madame de Noailles,\" repeated she, changing her tone, \"to\r\nretire into the reception-room. I wish to speak with Count von Mercy\r\nalone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must be permitted to say that your majesty's request cannot be\r\ngranted,\" replied Madame de Noailles. \"No Queen of France is permitted\r\nto receive a foreign ambassador otherwise than in the presence of the\r\ncourt. I shall have to ask his majesty's pardon for a breach of decorum,\r\nwhich I was too late to prevent--the reception of the ambassador here\r\nwith myself alone to witness the interview.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen's eyes flashed with anger as she listened to this presumptuous\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n\"You will have to ask pardon of no one but myself, madame, for your\r\nunseemly language to your sovereign.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, your majesty, I perform my duty, and this requires of me to\r\nsee that no one here commits any breach of court etiquette. The laws of\r\netiquette are as binding upon the queen as upon her subjects--and she\r\ncannot infringe them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I announce to you, madame, that no laws of yours shall be binding upon\r\nme. The Queen of France is here to make laws--not to receive them. And\r\nfor the last time I command you to quit this room, and to leave me alone\r\nwith the representative of my imperial mother.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Noailles made a deep courtesy, and backed out of the room.\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette looked after her, until the last traces of her long\r\ntrain had vanished, and the silk portiere had fallen in its place.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said she, taking a long breath, \"at last I have gained a victory.\r\nIt is now my turn to lecture, and madame has received her first\r\nscolding. Well, count, now that she is fairly off, what have you to tell\r\nme from Vienna?\"\r\n\r\nCount von Mercy looked toward the door, and having convinced himself\r\nthat it was well closed, he drew from his pocket a package, and\r\npresented it to the queen.\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette hastily tore open the seals and began to read.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said she, with a disappointed look, \"this is no private letter. It\r\nis nothing but a letter of instructions, directing me how to win the\r\nking's confidence, so as to influence his policy and secure a new ally\r\nto Austria. The empress need not remind me that I must look to the\r\ninterests of the house of Hapsburg. The Queen of France will never\r\nforget that she is the daughter of Maria Theresa, and she will do all in\r\nher power to promote an alliance between France and Austria. Tell my\r\nmother that I never will cease to be her subject, and that her interests\r\nshall always be mine. And now for the other mission.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Heaven!\" cried she, after opening the letter, \"more politics.\" She\r\nlooked down the page, and read: \"Personages whom I recommend as suitable\r\nfor the counsellors and household of the king.\"\r\n\r\nThis was quite a long list in the empress's handwriting, and at its head\r\nstood the name of the Duke de Choiseul. \"The Queen of France must use\r\nevery effort to secure his appointment as minister, for he is sincerely\r\nattached to us.\"\r\n\r\nMany other distinguished names were there; but not one of those which\r\nhad been mentioned by the king's father.\r\n\r\n\"I will preserve this paper with care,\" said Marie Antoinette, burying\r\nher letters deep in her pocket. \"No doubt, you know their contents,\r\ncount. A postscript says, 'Consult frequently with Mercy;' so let us\r\nbegin at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will your majesty not read the letter of the emperor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should I read it now? It grieves me to see these political\r\ndocuments from the hands of dear relatives who ought to write to me of\r\nhome and love. I will put it with the official letter of the empress for\r\nthe king to read.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your majesty, but I do not think it is official.\"\r\n\r\n\"Read it for me, then,\" said the queen, throwing herself back in the\r\ndeep recesses of her arm-chair. \"I have confidence enough in you to be\r\nwilling that you shall see my brother's letter, should it even be a\r\nprivate one.\"\r\n\r\nCount von Mercy bowed, and unfolded the letter, which was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Madame: I congratulate you upon your husband's accession to the throne\r\nof France. He will repair the faults of his predecessor's reign, and win\r\nthe love of his people. The French nation has groaned under the\r\ninflictions of a king who not only proscribed parliament, but intrusted\r\nevery office of state to his favorites. He banished De Choiseul,\r\nMalesherbes, and Chalotais; and in their stead elevated the Maurepas,\r\nthe D'Aiguillons, and that hateful Abbe Terray, who, for rapacity, were\r\nnone of them better than Du Barry--and thus he ended by losing the love\r\nof his subjects. I have often pitied Louis XV. for degrading himself as\r\nhe did before the eyes of his family, his subjects, and the world.\r\n\r\n\"Unite your efforts to those of your husband, that you may win the love\r\nof the French nation. Leave no stone unturned to secure their affection,\r\nfor, by so doing, you will prove a blessing to your people.\r\n\r\n\"Strengthen our alliance with France, and apply yourself to the mission\r\nfor which you were educated--that of peace-maker between two of the most\r\nimportant powers of Europe.\r\n\r\n\"I kiss your hands, and remain, with the highest esteem and\r\nconsideration, your majesty's friend and brother,\r\n\r\n\"Joseph.\" [Footnote: \"Letters of Joseph II, as Characteristic\r\nContributions,\" etc., p. 20.]\r\n\r\n\"You are right, count,\" said the queen, as the ambassador concluded his\r\nreading. \"This is no official document, but a most significant letter of\r\ninstructions. I am expected to preserve peace between France and\r\nAustria. Ah, I fear that I am not calculated to walk the slippery arena\r\nof politics, and I confess to you that I feel in no wise drawn toward\r\nit. It does seem to me that a queen of nineteen may be pardoned if she\r\nfeels some desire to enjoy life. I intend to begin by breaking the\r\nfetters which have hitherto made such wretched puppets of the queens of\r\nFrance; and before long you will see the workings of my court\r\nrevolution. But there is one thing near to my heart, which you must\r\nassist me to compass. The Duke de Choiseul must be minister of foreign\r\naffairs. I know that he desires it, and I am under obligations to him\r\nwhich deserve some return. I owe it to him that I am Queen of France.\r\nNow, if I succeed in elevating Choiseul to the ministry,\" continued the\r\nqueen, with an appealing smile, \"I hope that Austria will be satisfied,\r\nand will allow me to retire from the field. The Duke de Choiseul will be\r\na much abler auxiliary than I, near the king. We must, therefore, have\r\nhim recalled.\"\r\n\r\n\"The duke arrived in Paris from Chanteloup this morning, but does not\r\nthink it advisable to present himself, until he receives a message from\r\nthe king.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall see that the message is sent,\" said Marie Antoinette,\r\nconfidently. \"The king will not refuse me, I know. You shrug your\r\nshoulders, count. Do you think it doubtful?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty condescends to speak confidentially with me,\" said the\r\ncount, seriously. \"I am an old servant of your house, and my hair has\r\ngrown gray in its service. In consideration, then, of the deep affection\r\nwhich I have ever felt for your majesty, will you allow me to speak with\r\nyou frankly?\"\r\n\r\n\"I implore you, count, to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, your majesty, let me warn you to be careful. Things do not work\r\nat this French court as they ought to do. Your majesty has bitter\r\nenemies, who await an opportunity to declare themselves openly. The\r\nCount of Provence and the aunts of the king are at the head, and,\r\nbelieve me, they are watchful spies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my God!\" cried the poor young queen, \"what have I done to earn\r\ntheir enmity?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are an Austrian princess, and that suffices for them. Your marriage\r\nwas a victory over the anti-Austrian party, for which the Duke de\r\nChoiseul never will be forgiven; and as for yourself, if you give them\r\nthe opportunity, they will not scruple to take revenge upon your own\r\nroyal person. The Count of Provence has a sharp tongue, and his aunts\r\nand himself will spare no means to wound or to injure you. Therefore,\r\npardon me, if again I bid you beware of your enemies. There is Madame de\r\nNoailles, for instance, she belongs to the most powerful families in\r\nFrance, and the French nation regard her as the palladium of the queen's\r\nhonor. Your majesty cannot afford to offend her. It would be a great\r\nmisfortune for you, if she should resign her office; for her resignation\r\nwould place on the list of your enemies all the most influential nobles\r\nin France.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\" asked the queen, with a painful blush.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty; and I thank you for your condescension in listening\r\nso long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then hear me,\" said Marie Antoinette, rising and standing proudly\r\nbefore him. \"You tell me that I have enemies. Be it so, and may God\r\nforgive them! But it were unworthy the daughter of Maria Theresa to\r\nstoop to conciliate them. With visor raised, and front exposed, I stand\r\nbefore them. My blameless life shall be my defence, for I will so live\r\nthat all France shall be my champions. As for Madame de Noailles, I will\r\nmake no concessions to her. My virtue needs no more protection from\r\netiquette than that of any other woman. Heretofore the Queens of France\r\nhave been nothing but Marionettes in the hands of their high-born\r\nduennas. I intend to transform the puppets into women, whom the French\r\nnation can love and esteem, for I wish my people to know that their\r\nqueen's virtue is not a thing of form, but the veritable overflowing of\r\na heart aspiring to perfection.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right royally spoken!\" said a soft voice behind, and the queen\r\nstarting, beheld the king, who, having opened the door quietly, had\r\nheard her last words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCVI.\r\n\r\nTHE KING'S LIST.\r\n\r\nMarie Antoniette, with a happy smile, gave her hand to her husband. He\r\nraised it to his lips, and kissed it so fervently that his young wife\r\nblushed with pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what brings me to you, Antoinette?\" said he gayly. \"The\r\ndeadly anxiety of good Madame Etiquette. She met me in the anteroom, and\r\nconfessed that she had been guilty of the crime of leaving the queen\r\nalone with a foreign ambassador. To relieve her mind, I promised to come\r\nhither myself, and put an end to the treason that was hatching between\r\nFrance ad Austria.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Marie Antoinette, with a bewitching pout, \"then you came, not\r\nto see me, but to save Madame Etiquette a fit of the vapors.\"\r\n\r\n\"I made use of her as a pretext to intrude myself upon you,\" said the\r\nking with embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, your majesty well knows that you need no pretext to come in my\r\npresence!\" said Marie Antoinette, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, I require it just now, for I have broken up a charming\r\ntete-a-tete,\" said the king, bowing to Von Mercy.\r\n\r\n\"The count has brought me letters from the empress,\" said Marie\r\nAntoinette, \"And what do you suppose they were? Congratulations upon our\r\naccession to the throne.\"\r\n\r\nThe king smiled, but expressed no surprise.\r\n\r\n\"What, you are not surprised!\" said the queen. \"Do you take the count\r\nfor a sorcerer?\"\r\n\r\n\"I take him for a true and loyal friend of his sovereign,\" said Louis,\r\n\"and I only wish that I possessed one as faithful. But I am not at all\r\nastonished to hear of the congratulations, since the courier started off\r\nwith the news a week ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty knew it, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"A king must know all things,\" said he gravely. \"Are you not of my\r\nopinion, count? Is it not proper that a sovereign should possess a\r\nknowledge of every important letter which comes into his kingdom or\r\nleaves it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe so, your majesty,\" replied the count, somewhat confused.\r\n\r\n\"I am convinced of it, and so is the Empress of Austria,\" said the king,\r\nwith a laugh. \"She is admirably well posted in all that concerns foreign\r\ncourts, and not a document leaves the French embassy in Vienna of which\r\nshe has not a copy. Is it not so, Count von Mercy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not believe, sire, that there is any person in the French embassy\r\ncapable of betraying the interests of his country, or of revealing its\r\nsecrets.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then change your creed, count, for in every country there are men open\r\nto bribery. But,\" continued he, turning to the queen, \"we have wandered\r\nfrom our subject--your majesty's letters from Vienna. Have you good\r\nnews?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is merely official, sire,\" replied the queen, handing the letter to\r\nthe king.\r\n\r\nLouis looked it over; then replacing it upon the table, said, \"And the\r\nother letters?\"\r\n\r\n\"Which other letters?\" asked the queen.\r\n\r\n\"Did you not tell me there were several?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sire,\" replied the queen, reddening.\r\n\r\n\"What fables men do invent!\" exclaimed the king. \"A courier has just\r\narrived from the French embassy, in Vienna, with dispatches informing us\r\nthat Count von Mercy had received for your majesty one official letter\r\nfrom the empress, and two private letters of instruction, one of which\r\ncontained a list of persons recommended by her majesty; and, finally, a\r\nfourth missive, private, from the Emperor Joseph. And all this is pure\r\ninvention, Count von Mercy?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, your majesty,\" said the count, with much embarrassment, while\r\nMarie Antoinette cast down her eyes, and blushed.\r\n\r\nThe king enjoyed their confusion for a while; he seemed to take pleasure\r\nin this first triumph of his regal power, and a smile flitted over his\r\nrather clumsy features.\r\n\r\n\"You see, then,\" continued he, \"that I have received false intelligence,\r\nand it is evident that Austrians are less corrupt than Frenchmen, for I\r\nam told that Count von Mercy and Prince Kaunitz are au fait to every\r\nthing that transpires in the palace here. Be that as it may, we intend\r\nto follow the example of the queen. Our policy shall be so frank and\r\nhonorable that all the world may know it and welcome. But--it occurs to\r\nme that the mistress of ceremonies is in great anguish of mind. She will\r\nnot recover her equanimity until she sees you again, count.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case, your majesty, I beg leave to retire,\" replied the count.\r\n\r\nThe king bowed, and the queen gave him her hand.\r\n\r\nAs the count was about to raise the portiere, the king called him back.\r\n\"Do you send a courier to Vienna to-day?\" asked his majesty. \"Yes, sire,\r\nin one hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let me impart to you a secret which I think will interest her\r\nimperial majesty of Austria--my new ministry.\"\r\n\r\n\"How! has your your majesty already chosen them?\" asked Marie\r\nAntoinette, anxiously.\r\n\r\nThe king nodded. \"It was my first sacred duty to seek guides for my\r\ninexperience, and I have chosen ministers who are able statesmen, and\r\nhave already served before.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen's eyes brightened, and even Count von Mercy seemed surprised\r\nand pleased.\r\n\r\n\"Do, your majesty, let us have their names,\" said Marie Antoinette.\r\n\r\n\"First, Monsieur de Maurepas.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen uttered an exclamation. \"The minister of the regency, who has\r\nbeen banished for forty years!\"\r\n\r\n\"The same. He was a friend of my father. He will be prime minister; and\r\nas I am so unfortunate as to have to bear the weight of royalty at\r\ntwenty years, I have taken care to select old and experienced men as my\r\ncounsellors.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is to succeed the Duke d'Aiguillon?\" cried Marie Antoinette,\r\n\"for I presume that your majesty intends to give him his dismissal.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would be glad to retain him as my minister,\" said the king,\r\npointedly, \"for his policy is identical with mine. He has the interests\r\nof France at heart, and has never suffered himself to be led away by\r\nforeign influence. But unluckily, he was too intimate with Du Barry, and\r\non this ground I shall dismiss him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And his successor?\" asked the queen, scarcely able to restrain her\r\nbitter disappointment.\r\n\r\n\"His successor is the Count do Vergennes.\"\r\n\r\n\"De Vergennes!\" cried the queen, scornfully. \"He who married a slave in\r\nConstantinople?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you have heard that ridiculous story, which was invented by\r\nMonsieur de Choiseul? Nobody here ever believed it; and let me tell you\r\nthat the Countess de Vergennes enjoys the esteem and consideration of\r\nall who know her. Vergennes himself is a man of talent, and will do me\r\ngood service. The other ministers are: for the war department, Count de\r\nMuy; for the minister of finance, instead of that hateful Abbe\r\nTerray--(was not that the emperor's expression?)--I have chosen Count de\r\nClugny.\"\r\n\r\n\"Count de Clugny!\" said Marie Antoinette, again beginning to hope. \"Does\r\nyour majesty mean the friend of the Duke de Choiseul?\"\r\n\r\n\"Himself, madame,\" said the king, coolly. \"And while you are speaking of\r\nMonsieur de Choiseul, I am reminded that this is not the first time his\r\nname has been mentioned to-day. You, Count von Mercy, are a friend of\r\nhis--I am not. You can, therefore, tell me whether it is true that he\r\nhas left Chantoloup, wither the deceased king had banished him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire, the Duke de Choiseul arrived this morning in Paris.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can he want in Paris?\" asked the king, with an unconscious look.\r\n\"Why did he leave Chanteloup? It seems to me that for the man who is so\r\nlucky as to have a landed estate, this is the very time of year to stay\r\nthere. You had better advise your friend to return to the country. And\r\nnow, count, you know all that I have to tell, and I will detain you no\r\nlonger. Madame de Noailles must be in despair. Comfort her by informing\r\nher that you left the Queen of France in the company of her husband.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCVII.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST PASQUINADE.\r\n\r\nThe court had left Choisy for the Chateau de la Muette, near Paris. Here\r\nthe queen was to hold her first public levee, and her subjects longed to\r\nappear before her, for the Parisians were enthusiastic admirers of grace\r\nand beauty. Marie Antoinette had won their hearts by refusing to accept\r\nthe tax called \"La ceinture de la reine.\" This tax was the perquisite of\r\nthe Queen of France on her accession to the throne. But having\r\ndiscovered that the nobles had managed to evade it and cast the burden\r\nof taxation upon the poor, Marie Antoinette had requested her husband's\r\nleave to relinquish her right to it. Like wildfire the news of the young\r\nqueen's generosity spread throughout Paris; and in all the streets,\r\ncafe, and cabarets the people were singing this couplet\r\n\r\n\"Vous renoncez, charmante souveraine, Au plus beau de vos revenus; A\r\nquol vous serviraiio la celnture de refine, Vous avez celle de Venus.\"\r\n\r\nThey sang, they shouted, and made merry, happy in the possession of a\r\nyoung king, and a beautiful queen, casting never a thought toward him\r\nwho, years before, had been surnamed Le Bien-aime.[Footnote: \"Memoires\r\nde Weber,\" vol. i., p. 43.]\r\n\r\nOne speculating jeweller, alone, honored the memory of the deceased\r\nking, and made his fortune thereby. He manufactured a mourning\r\nsnuff-box, of black shagreen, whose lid was ornamented with a portrait\r\nof the queen. He called his boxes \"La consolation, dans le\r\nchagrin,\"[Footnote: \"Mbmoires de Madame de Campan\" vol. i., p. 91.] and\r\nhis portrait and pun became so popular, that in less than a week he had\r\nsold a hundred thousand of these boxes.[Footnote: This word \"chagrin,\"\r\nsignifies not only grief, but also that preparation of leather, which,\r\nin English, is called \"shagreen.\" Hence the pun.]\r\n\r\nLouis, also, had his share of the national good-will. He renounced the\r\ntax called \"Le joyeux avenement;\" and to commemorate the act, another\r\nsnuff-box made its appearance in Paris as a pendant to the \"Consolation\r\nin Grief.\" The king's box contained the portraits of Louis XII. and\r\nHenry IV. Below these, was his own likeness, with the following\r\ninscription: \"Les peres du peuple, XII et IV. font XVI.\" These boxes\r\nwere as popular as those of the queen, and Louis and Marie Antoinette\r\nwere the idols of the Parisians.\r\n\r\n\"Long live the king!\" was the cry from morn till night. Hope brightened\r\nevery eye, and reigned in every heart. The people dreamed of peace,\r\nhappiness, and plenty, and the fashions symbolized their state of mind.\r\nThe women dressed their heads with ears of wheat, and ate their dragees\r\nfrom cornucopias. The men poured out their enthusiasm in sonnets and\r\naddresses, and every thing in France was couleur de rose.\r\n\r\nCouleur de rose--with one exception. The anti-Austrian party frowned,\r\nand plotted, and hated. Exasperated by the enthusiasm which the\r\nbeautiful young queen inspired, they watched her every motion, eager to\r\nmagnify the most trivial imperfection into crime; hoping, sooner or\r\nlater, to render her obnoxious to the French people, and finally, to\r\ncompass the end of all their wicked intrigues--a separation between the\r\nking and queen, and the disgrace and banishment of Marie Antoinette to\r\nAustria.\r\n\r\nIt was the day of the grand reception, at La Muette, where every lady\r\nhaving a right to appear at court might come uninvited and be presented\r\nto the queen. The great throne-room was prepared for the occasion; and\r\nalthough its decorations were black, they were tastefully enlivened with\r\nwhite and silver. The throne itself was covered with black velvet,\r\ntrimmed with silver and fringe. Hundreds of ladies thronged the room,\r\nall with their eyes fixed upon the door through which the queen and her\r\ncourt must make their entrance.\r\n\r\nThe folding-doors were thrown wide open, and, announced by her mistress\r\nof ceremonies, Marie Antoinette appeared.\r\n\r\nA murmur of admiration was heard among the crowd. Never had the queen\r\nlooked so transcendently lovely as she did to-day in her dress of deep\r\nmourning. She seemed to feel the solemnity of her position as\r\nqueen-consort of a great nation, and the expression of her face was\r\ntranquil and dignified. No woman ever represented royalty with better\r\ngrace than Marie Antoinette, and the old coquettes of the regency and of\r\nthe corrupt court of Louis XV. were awed by her stateliness. They could\r\nnot but confess that they were in the presence of a noble and virtuous\r\nwoman; therefore they disliked her, whispering one to the other, \"What\r\nan actress!\"\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette took her seat upon the throne. On her right and left\r\nwere the royal family, and behind them the ladies of the court. Opposite\r\nstood Madame de Noailles, whose duty it was to present those who were\r\nunknown to the queen.\r\n\r\nThe presentation began. Forth in their high-heeled shoes came the\r\nnoble-born widows, who, old and faded, were loath to forget that in the\r\ndays of the regency they had been blooming like the queen, and who, in\r\nhappy ignorance of their crow's feet and wrinkles, were decked in the\r\nself-same costumes which had once set off their roses and dimples.\r\n\r\nIt was a ludicrous sight--these ugly old women, with their jewels and\r\npatches, their extraordinary head-dresses and their deep, courtesies,\r\npainful by reason of the aching bones of three-score and ten. The young\r\nprincesses dared not raise their eyes to these representatives of\r\nby-gone coquetry, for they were afraid to commit a crime--they were\r\nafraid that they might laugh. But the ladies of honor, safe behind the\r\nhoops of the queen and her sisters-in-law made merry over the\r\nmagnificent old ruins. Madame de Noailles was so busy with the front,\r\nthat she overlooked the rear, where the lively young Marquise de\r\nCharente Tounerre, tired of standing, had glided down and seated herself\r\ncomfortably on the floor. Neither could she see that the marquise, in\r\nthe exuberance of her youthful spirits, was pulling the other ladies by\r\ntheir skirts, and amusing them with mimicry of the venerable coquettes\r\nbefore mentioned; so that while etiquette and ceremony were parading\r\ntheir ugliness in front of the throne, behind it, youth and beauty were\r\ntittering and enjoying the absurd pageant in utter thoughtlessness of\r\nall consequences.\r\n\r\nThe mistress of ceremonies was in the act of presenting one of the most\r\nshrivelled and most elaborately dressed of the ancients, when the queen,\r\nattracted by the whispering behind, turned her head in the direction of\r\nher ladies of honor. There on the floor, sat the Marquise de Charente\r\nTounerre, imitating every gesture of the old comtesse; while the others,\r\nincluding the princesses themselves, were pursing up their lips, and\r\nsmothering their laughter behind handkerchiefs and fans. The drolleries\r\nof the marquise were too much for the queen. She turned away in terror,\r\nlest they should infect her with untimely levity, and just at that\r\nmoment the comtesse made precisely such a courtesy as the marquise was\r\nmaking behind her.\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette felt that her dignity was departing. She straggled to\r\nrecall it, but in vain; and instead of the stately inclination which it\r\nwas her duty to return, she suddenly opened her fan to hide the mirth\r\nwhich she was unable to control.\r\n\r\nThe gesture was seen not only by the austere mistress of ceremonies, but\r\nby the comtesse herself, who, furious at the insult, looked daggers at\r\nthe queen, and omitting her third courtesy, swept indignantly to her\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nA short pause ensued. Madame de Noailles was so shocked that she forgot\r\nto give the signal for another presentation. The queen's face was still\r\nburied under her fan, and the princesses had followed her example.\r\nDiscontent was manifest upon the countenances of all present, and the\r\nlady whose turn it was to advance did so with visible reluctance.\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette recovered her self-possession, and looked with perfect\r\nserenity toward the high and mighty duchess, whose titles were being\r\npompously enumerated by the punctilious mistress of ceremonies. As ill\r\nluck would have it, this one was older, uglier, and more strangely\r\nbedizened than all the others together. The queen felt a spasmodic\r\ntwitch of her face; she colored violently, and opening her fan again, it\r\nwas evident to all that assemblage of censorious dames that for the\r\nsecond time youth and animal spirits had prevailed over decorum.\r\n\r\nIn vain Marie Antoinette sought to repair the contretemps. In vain she\r\nwent among them with her sweetest smiles and most gracious words. Their\r\noutraged grandeur was not to be appeased--she had offended beyond\r\nforgiveness.\r\n\r\nThe Areopagus sent forth its fist. The queen was a frivolous woman; she\r\nhad that worst of failings--a taste for satire. She despised all\r\nconventionalities, and trampled all etiquette under foot.\r\n\r\nOn that day the number of her enemies was increased by more than a\r\nhundred persons, who attacked her with tongues sharper than two-edged\r\nswords. The first thrust was given her on the morning that followed the\r\nreception; and the same people who a few days before had been singing\r\nher praises on the Pont-neuf, were equally, if not better pleased with\r\nthe ballad of \"La Reine moqueuse,\" of which the cruel refrain was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"Petite reine de vingt ails Vous qui traitez si mal les gens, Vous\r\nrepasserez la barriere Laire, laire, laire, lanlaire, lanla.\" [Footnote:\r\n\"Memoires de Madame de C'ampan,\" vol. i., pp. 90, 91.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW FASHIONS.\r\n\r\nThe queen had submitted to a state of things which she felt to be\r\nirremediable. She had renounced all idea of interceding with the king\r\nfor De Choiseul, for she felt that interference on her part would be\r\nresented; and she could not afford to lessen, by so much as a shade, the\r\nkindly feelings which her husband had begun to manifest toward her.\r\n\r\nLouis appeared to have no greater happiness than that which he found in\r\nhis wife's society. They were often seen wandering in the shady walks of\r\nthe palace gardens, talking, jesting, and laughing together, as might\r\nhave done any other young couple, unencumbered by the burden of royalty.\r\nIt had even happened to Louis to steal an arm around the graceful form\r\nof the queen, and once or twice to bestow a shy kiss upon her ivory\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the king was thawing; and Marie Antoinette, who had so\r\nlonged and pined for his regard, sometimes blushed, while with beating\r\nheart she indulged a hope that the king was falling in love.\r\n\r\nShe sought, by every means in her power, to please him; and she who,\r\nhitherto, had seemed indifferent to dress, now bestowed hours of thought\r\nupon the toilet of the day.\r\n\r\nThe anti-Austrian party, the royal aunts, the brothers of the king, and\r\nthe Orleans family, all her enemies, observed this new taste for dress\r\nwith secret satisfaction. Not one of them suspected that it was aimed at\r\nthe heart of the king; and that Marie Antoinette, whom they were\r\nderiding as a coquette, was coquetting with her husband, and dressing\r\nfor him alone. So they flattered and encouraged her, hoping to divert\r\nher mind from politics, and urge her on to ruin.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Chartres had mentioned to the queen a Parisian modiste,\r\nwho had instituted a complete revolution in dress. This wonderful\r\nmodiste, whose taste in modes was exquisite, was Mademoiselle Bertin.\r\nThe duchess had described her dresses, laces, caps, and coiffures, with\r\nso much enthusiasm, that Marie Antoinette grew impatient with curiosity,\r\nordered her carriage, and sent a message to Madauie de Noailles to\r\nprepare to accompany her at once to Bertin's establishment.\r\n\r\nMadame received this message with indignation, and instead of making\r\nready to obey, went in hot haste to the queen's reception room.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to drive to Bertin's to make some purchases,\" said Marie\r\nAntoinette, as her tormentor appeared at the door.\r\n\r\n\"That is impossible, your majesty,\" said the guardian of the inferno of\r\netiquette. \"No Queen of France has ever set foot within the precincts of\r\na shop, or has ever appeared in a public place of that sort. It would be\r\nsuch an egregious breach of etiquette, that I am convinced your majesty\r\nwill not be guilty of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the queen, with a scornful laugh, \"I will not disturb your\r\nvirtuous convictions. I will not be guilty of that which no Queen of\r\nFrance has ever stooped to do, so that you can have Bertin sent to the\r\npalace, and I can examine her goods here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here! Your majesty would receive a modiste in your reception room!\"\r\ncried De Noailles, rolling up the whites of her eyes. \"I beseech your\r\nmajesty to remember that none but the noble ladies, who have the\r\nprivilege of the tabouret, are allowed to enter the queen's\r\nreception-room.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen bit her rosy lips. \"Well, then, madame,\" said she, \"I will\r\nreceive Bertin in my own cabinet. I presume there can be no objections\r\nto that; and, if there were, I should certainly not heed them.\"\r\n\r\n\"The duty of my office, nevertheless, obliges me to remark to your--\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no office at this court which justifies any one in a direct\r\ndisobedience of the queen's orders. Go, then, madame, and order that\r\nBertin be sent to me in an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" murmured Marie Antoinette, as the mistress of ceremonies slowly\r\nretreated, \"that woman's sole delight in life is to irritate and annoy\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\nAn hour later, Mademoiselle Bertin made her appearance before the queen.\r\nFour royal lackeys followed her, laden with band-boxes.\r\n\r\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said the queen, \"have you brought me the latest\r\nfashions?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty,\" replied Bertin, reverentially, \"I bring the\r\nmaterials wherewith to fill your majesty's orders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you not told to bring your samples of fashions?\" asked Marie\r\nAntoinette, with surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty, there are no new fashions,\" said Bertin. \"Your majesty's\r\nword is necessary to create them. A queen does not follow the fashion,\r\nit follows her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you intend that I shall invent now fashions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty. The Queen of France cannot stoop to wear that which\r\nhas already been worn by others.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" said the queen, pleased by the flattery of the shrewd\r\nmodiste.\" Make haste, and show me your goods, that I may begin at once\r\nto set the fashions to the court. It will be quite an amusement to\r\ninvent new modes of dress.\"\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Bertin smiled, and, opening her boxes, exhibited her goods.\r\nThere were the beautiful silken fabrics of Lyons; the shimmering white\r\nsatin, besprinkled with bouquets that rivalled nature; there were heavy,\r\nshining velvets, heightened by embroidery of gold and silver; laces,\r\nfrom Alencon and Valenciennes, whose web was as delicate as though elfin\r\nfingers, had spun the threads; muslins, from India, so fine that they\r\ncould only he woven in water; crapes, from China, with the softness of\r\nsatin and the sheen of velvet; there were graceful ostrich-plumes from\r\nAfrica, and flowers from Paris, so wondrous in their beauty that nothing\r\nwas wanting to their perfection save perfume.\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette flitted from one treasure to another; her white hands\r\nat one moment deriving new beauty from the dark velvets upon which they\r\nrested; at another, looking lovelier than ever, as they toyed with the\r\ntransparent laces. There was nothing queenly about her now. She was\r\nmerely a charming woman, anxious to outshine all other women in the eyes\r\nof one man.\r\n\r\nWhen Mademoiselle Berlin took her leave, the queen gave her orders to\r\nreturn to the palace daily. \"One thing I shall exact of you,\r\nmademoiselle, you shall disclose the secret of my toilet for the day to\r\nnobody; and the fashions shall be made public at the end of one week.\"\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Bertin, with a solemnity befitting the importance of her\r\noffice, swore that henceforth the hands which had been honored by\r\ncarrying out the ideas of a queen, should never work for lesser mortals;\r\nthat her dresses should be made with closed doors, and that she would\r\nrather be led to execution than betray to a living soul the mysteries of\r\nher royal patroness's toilet. [Footnote: Mademoiselle Bertin, from that\r\nday, became an important personage, and received many a rich present\r\nfrom noble ladies anxious to imitate the queen in dress.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCIX\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPLE OF ETIQUETTE.\r\n\r\nThe hour for the queen's toilet was one of ravishment to Madame de\r\nNoailles; for it was a daily glorification of that etiquette which she\r\nworshipped, and which Marie Antoinette abhorred. In that hour, its\r\nchains were on her hands and feet. She could neither breathe, speak, nor\r\nmove, but within the narrow limits of its weary exactions.\r\n\r\nThe queen's toilet, then, was Madame de Noailles' triumph; and she\r\nalways made her appearance in the dressing-room with an air of supreme\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe first lady of honor poured the water into the golden basin, and\r\nMarie Antoinette, who at least had the privilege of washing her own\r\nhands, stood patiently waiting until the towel had been passed by a lady\r\nof the bedchamber to the same lady of honor who had poured out the\r\nwater. The latter, on one knee, gave the towel, and the queen wiped her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nThe second act of the royal toilet began at the solemn moment when the\r\nqueen changed her richly-embroidered night-chemise for the simpler one\r\nshe wore during the day. This changing of garments was a sublime\r\nceremonial, not only in the queen's dressing-room, but also in that of\r\nthe king. At the king's great levee, none but a prince of the blood had\r\nthe right to reach him his shirt. At the lesser levee, the nobleman whom\r\nthe king wished to honor, was called upon to fill this high office; and\r\nthe enviable mortal, thus honored, remained near the king's person for\r\nthe whole day; was entitled to dine at the royal table, and had a seat\r\nin the king's hunting-wagon.\r\n\r\nNow, at the toilet of the queen, the ceremonial was different; and, as\r\nin all such matters, more onerous for the woman than for the man. The\r\nhonor of presenting the chemise, devolved upon the lady present whose\r\nrank was the highest.\r\n\r\nOn the particular day to which we allude, it was the privilege of Madame\r\nde Noailles. Marie Antoinette had allowed her night-dress to slip from\r\nher shoulders, and stood, bare to the waist, awaiting the pleasure of\r\nher mistress of ceremonies. She crossed her beautiful arms, and bent her\r\nhead in readiness to receive the chemise, which the lady of the\r\nbedchamber was in the act of passing to Madame de Noailles.\r\n\r\nAt this moment there was a knock at the door, and the Duchess of Orleans\r\nentered the room. A triumphant smile lit up the face of Madame\r\nEtiquette, for now the ceremony would be prolonged. It was no longer her\r\nduty, it was that of the duchess, to wait upon the queen. But the proud\r\nCountess de Noailles could not condescend to pass the garment to the\r\nduchess. That was the duty of the aforesaid lady of the bedchamber. The\r\nmistress of ceremonies motioned her to approach, and the duchess began\r\nto draw off her gloves.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Marie Antoinette, with folded arms, stood beautiful as one of\r\nDian's nymphs, but very uncomfortable in her beauty; for she was\r\nbeginning to grow chilly, and her teeth chattered. At last the\r\npreparations were made, and the duchess advanced with the coveted\r\ngarment.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she stopped, and stood perfectly still. She had heard the voice\r\nof \"Madame,\" the Countess of Provence; and it would have been an\r\nunpardonable sin for the Duchess of Orleans to deprive a princess of the\r\nblood, of handing the chemise to the queen.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and the sister-in-law of Marie Antoinette came in. The\r\nduchess retreated--Madame de Noailles approached slowly and relieved her\r\nof the chemise, and with unflinching deliberation, again gave it into\r\nthe hands of the lady of the bedchamber.\r\n\r\nAnd there stood the queen, shivering and waiting. Scarlet with shame and\r\nanger, though trembling from head to foot, she murmured resentful words\r\nagainst her tormentors. The princess saw it all, and hastened to her\r\nrelief. Without stopping to remove her gloves, she took the chemise, and\r\nadvancing, in great haste, to throw it over the queen's head, she struck\r\nagainst her high toupet and disarranged the headdress.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my dear sister,\" said the queen, laughing, \"my hair will have to be\r\ndressed anew.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Noailles drew down her eyebrows, as she was accustomed to do\r\nwhen irritated by indecorum, and motioned to the second lady of the\r\nbedchamber to put on the queen's shoes, The royal toilet now went on\r\nmore smoothly, and was completed according to form. This done, it became\r\nthe duty of the victim to pass into her reception-room, attended by her\r\nladies. Madame de Noailles had opened the door and stood before it like\r\na she-cerberus waiting for her prey to pass within, when the queen,\r\nstill laughing at her disordered coiffure, threw herself into a chair\r\nbefore cheval-glass, and said:\r\n\r\n\"I hope, madame, that etiquette does not require of the Queen of France\r\nto appear before her court with dishevelled hair. If I may be permitted\r\nto express a preference in the matter, I would like to have my hair in\r\norder.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Noailles closed the door, and turned stiffly to the first lady\r\nof the bedchamber.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" said Marie Antoinette, \"I will not trouble my good Madame de\r\nCampan today. Did my secretary fetch the hair-dresser from Paris?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty,\" said a lady in waiting, \"the hair-dresser is in the\r\nouter room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go and call him, De Campan. And now, ladies,\" said Marie Antionette to\r\nthe princesses, \"you shall see one of the demi-gods. Leonard is called\r\nin the world of fashion 'le dieu des coiffures.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Leonard!\" exclaimed Madame de Noailles. \"And has your majesty then\r\nforgotten that the queen is not permitted to be waited upon by any but\r\nwomanly hands?\"\r\n\r\n\"The queen not permitted!\" echoed Marie Antoinette, proudly. \"We shall\r\nsee whether the Queen of France asks permission of her subjects to\r\nemploy a male or female hair dresser!\"\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and the discussion was stopped by the entrance of\r\nMadame de Campan with Leonard.\r\n\r\n\"Now, ladies,\" continued the queen, \"be so good as to await me in the\r\nreception-room.\" As she saw that the prim lips of De Noailles were about\r\nto be opened, she added: \"The mistress of ceremonies and the ladies of\r\nthe bedchamber will remain.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard's skilful hands were soon at work, loosening the queen's hair;\r\nand it glistened, as it fell, like glimmering gold. He surveyed it with\r\nsuch looks of enthusiasm as a statuary might bestow upon the spotless\r\nblock of marble, whence he will fashion, ere long, the statue of a\r\ngoddess.\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette, from the mirror, saw his complacent face, and smiled.\r\n\"What style do you intend to adopt for me?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"The coiffure a la Marie Antoinette,\" said Leonard.\r\n\r\n\"I have never seen it.\"\r\n\r\nHere Leonard sank the subject, and became the artiste. His head went\r\nproudly back with a look of conscious power.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty must not think me so barren of invention that I should\r\ndeck the head of my queen with a coiffure that has been seen before by\r\nmortal eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you are about to invent a coiffure?\"\r\n\r\n\"If it please your majesty--if your majesty will condescend to leave its\r\nfashion to the inspiration of my genius.\"\r\n\r\n\"Follow your inspiration by all means,\" said the queen, highly amused,\r\nand Leonard began his work. A long, solemn pause ensued, and all eyes\r\nwere strained to see the result. He combed the queen's hair over a\r\ntrellis of fine wire, then he introduced two down cushions, which he had\r\nbrought in his band-box, and after he had built him a tower of a foot\r\nhigh, he took a long breath and surveyed the structure. Then he glanced\r\nat the toilet-table where lay a mass of flowers, feathers, and laces,\r\nwhich Bertin had left.\r\n\r\n\"May I be allowed to select from these?\" asked he.\r\n\r\nThe queen nodded, and Leonard chose a bunch of white ostrich-feathers,\r\nwhich he prepared to place in her head.\r\n\r\n\"Feathers!\" cried Marie Antoinette. \"You surely are not going to put\r\nfeathers in my hair!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your majesty,\" said Leonard, with an air of supreme wisdom,\r\n\"if I beg you to allow me to complete my coiffure, before you decide\r\nupon its merits.\" And he went to work to fasten the feathers in his\r\ntower.\r\n\r\n\"This is really becoming,\" said the queen, not reflecting that her\r\nbeautiful face with its lofty brow and exquisite contour could bear any\r\nabomination with which Leonard chose to invest it.\r\n\r\n\"I adopt the feathers,\" said she, \"and allow you to call the coiffure\r\nafter me. Poor ostriches, they will not thank me! From this day you are\r\nin my service, Monsieur Leonard, and my steward will assign you your\r\napartments.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard bowed with the dignity of an artist who feels that in the favor\r\nof his sovereign he receives his merited reward.\r\n\r\n\"Come every morning at this hour, and every evening at seven o'clock,\"\r\nsaid Marie Antoinette. \"Meanwhile, you are at liberty to dress the hair\r\nof as many ladies as you choose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your majesty,\" interposed Madame de Noailles. \"An old\r\nimmutable regulation of the French court forbids any person employed by\r\nthe royal family to serve a subject; and the coiffeur of the queen\r\ncannot be allowed to dress the hair of any lady in France.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, I give him permission to dress as many heads as he\r\npleases, when he is not in attendance upon myself. What is the use of a\r\nman's taste and talent if it is all to be wasted on one monotonous\r\nemployment? Let Monsieur Leonard exercise his ingenuity upon different\r\nstyles of women, that he may have scope for his imagination.\"\r\n\r\nThe mistress of ceremonies sighed, and opened the door. Marie Antoinette\r\napproached it gayly, for she was all anxiety to test the effect of her\r\ncoiffure upon the ladies in waiting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER C.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW FASHIONS AND THEIR UNHAPPY RESULTS.\r\n\r\nA murmur of surprise and admiration was heard among the ladies, when the\r\nqueen appeared in the reception-room. The Countess of Provence could\r\nscarcely retain her discontent, as she surveyed the magnificent costume\r\nof her beautiful sister-in-law.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments the queen enjoyed the pleasure of being sincerely\r\nadmired. Then, advancing to the princess, she took her hand and said:\r\n\"Oblige me, dear sister, by dining with the king and myself en famille.\r\nLet us have a social meal together to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, your majesty, I will do so with pleasure; but what you are\r\npleased to call a family dinner will lose all its charm through the\r\ncuriosity of your majesty's admirers, who come from Paris, from\r\nVersailles, and from all the ends of the earth, to look at the royal\r\nfamily taking their dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" said the queen, eagerly. \"I look upon this daily\r\nexhibition as a tyrannical custom, which must be abolished. It is too\r\nhard that we cannot have our meals in private, but must be gazed at like\r\nanimals, and denied the privilege of confidential intercourse. I have\r\nsubmitted to be stared at for four years, but the queen is not to be\r\nruled as the dauphiness has been. We shall dine to-day en famille, and\r\nfrom this time the public have access to our dining-room no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is delightful news,\" answered the princess, \"but I pity the good\r\npeople who are coming in expectation of seeing your majesty at table.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will return to their homes,\" said the queen, slightly raising her\r\nshoulders, \"and when they reflect coolly on the subject, they will\r\ncertainly not think less of me because I prefer to dine like the rest of\r\nthe world. I believe that if we desire popularity with the people, we\r\nmust show them that we have feeling hearts like themselves, and it is by\r\nsuch means that I hope to gain the love of the French nation.\"\r\n\r\nThe princess was secretly vexed at the honesty and purity of the queen's\r\nmotives, but she forced a smile, and replied: \"You have already\r\nsucceeded in doing so: for the French people adore you; and if they\r\ncould only see you to-day in that piquant head-dress, they would verify\r\nthe saying of the mayor of Paris: 'Your majesty beholds in us a hundred\r\nthousand lovers.' \"\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette laughed. \"Quite a respectable army,\" said she slightly\r\nblushing; \"but to complete its worth it must be commanded by the king.\r\nHow surprised he will be to see us dining in private!\"\r\n\r\n\"His majesty has not been consulted?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a surprise which I have in store for him. He has often bewailed\r\nthis stupid custom, but dared not complain, for fear of remarks. I am\r\nless timid than he, and I am about to give you a proof of the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame de Noailles,\" added she, aloud, \"inform the ushers that while\r\nthe royal family are at dinner no strangers will be admitted to the\r\ndining-room. The privilege of entrance shall cease from to-day.\"\r\n\r\nThe countess had been awaiting her opportunity to speak.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty,\" said she, with an expression of painful anxiety, \"I\r\nentreat of you not to revoke that privilege! Believe me when I tell you\r\nthat it is dangerous to interfere with customs which are so old that the\r\npeople have grown to look upon them as right. Ever since the days of\r\nFrancis I the royal family has dined in public, and every decently-clad\r\nperson has enjoyed the privilege of entering the banquet-room. Moreover,\r\nallow me to observe to your majesty that this public meal is an express\r\nceremony of the French court, and it is indispensable to its dignity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Etiquette, madame,\" replied Marie Antoinette, \"is not made for\r\nsovereigns, but regulated by them. You speak of the people's rights;\r\nallow me to claim something for mine. It has ever been the habit of\r\nkings and queens to give commands, not to receive them. Let me,\r\ntherefore, advise you to strike out from your code of etiquette the rule\r\nwhich obliges us to dine in public, and to insert in its stead the\r\nfollowing: `On days of festivals or of public rejoicing, the people will\r\nbe admitted to the king's dining-room.' And now, sister, let us take a\r\nturn in the park.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the queen took the arm of the princess, and, followed by the\r\nladies in waiting, they went out upon the terrace. Madame de Noailles\r\nremained behind in the large, empty reception-room. Her face was pale\r\nand troubled, and she leaned despondently against the high back of an\r\narm-chair near that from which the queen had just risen.\r\n\r\n\"Royalty totters on its throne!\" murmured she, in a low voice. \"This\r\nwoman's bold hand is shaking the pillars of her own temple, and when it\r\nfalls it will bury both king and queen under its fragments. She laughs\r\nat etiquette as ridiculous despotism; she does not know that it is the\r\nhalo that renders her sacred in the eyes of the people. I see the\r\ntempest lowering,\" continued the mistress of ceremonies, after a\r\nthoughtful pause. \"The queen is surrounded by enemies whom she defies,\r\nand those who would be her friends she alienates by her haughtiness. In\r\nthe innocence of her thoughtless heart, what unhappy precedents has she\r\nestablished this day! They are the dragon's teeth that will grow armed\r\nmen to destroy their sower. She despises conventionalities and braves\r\nold customs. She does not know how dearly she will pay for her milliner,\r\nher hair-dresser, and her dinners in private! I have done my duty. I\r\nhave warned and remonstrated, and will continue to do so as long as my\r\npatience and honor can endure the humiliations to which I am\r\nexposed--but no longer! By the Heaven that hears me--no longer!\"\r\n\r\nThe countess was right. The apparently trifling incidents of the day\r\nwere fraught with mournful consequences to the queen. Heretofore she had\r\nbeen remarked for her simplicity of dress; from the introduction of\r\nBertin and Leonard into her household she dressed with rare\r\nmagnificence. Not only the ladies of the court, but those of the city,\r\nfollowed her extravagance at a distance. They must wear the same jewels,\r\nthe same flowers, the same costly silks and laces. Ostrich-feathers\r\nbecame the rage, and they were soon so scarce that fabulous prices were\r\npaid to import them for the use of the Frenchwomen.\r\n\r\nThe trousseau of a young beauty became as important as her dowry.\r\nMothers and husbands sighed, and at last ended by abusing the queen. It\r\nwas she who had set the example of this wasteful luxury in dress; she\r\nwho had bewitched all the women, so that they had gone mad for a feather\r\nor a flower. Strife was in every house. Parents were at variance with\r\ntheir children; marriages were broken off through the exactions of the\r\nbrides; and on all sides the blame of everybody's domestic troubles fell\r\nupon the shoulders of the queen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CI.\r\n\r\nSUNRISE.\r\n\r\nThe court had now moved to Marly. Each day brought its variety of\r\nsports, and the palace became the very shrine of pleasure. Even the\r\nking, fascinated by his wife's grace and gayety, lost his awkward\r\nbearing, and became a devoted lover. He was ready to gratify every whim\r\nof hers without ever inquiring whether it was consistent with the\r\ndignity and station of a queen. True, all her whims were innocent in\r\nthemselves; but some of them were childish, and therefore inappropriate\r\nto her position.\r\n\r\nThe king grew so bold that he paid graceful compliments to the queen on\r\nthe subject of her beauty; and in the exuberance of his young, gushing\r\nlove, he went beyond his courtiers in felicity of expression, so that\r\nfinally he became more eloquent than D'Artois, more impassioned than De\r\nChartres, and more piquant than De Provence.\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette beheld this transformation with rapture; and her little\r\ninnocent coquetries with the princes and noblemen of the court had but\r\none aim--that of heightening the effect of her charms upon her royal\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n\"One of these days,\" thought she, \"he will learn to love me. I await\r\nthis day, as Nature throughout her dark winter nights, awaits the rising\r\nof the glorious sun. Oh how happy will I be when the morning of my\r\nwedded love has dawned!\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\"--added she, interrupting herself and smiling, \"what a simpleton I\r\nam with my similes; like a blind man enraptured with a color! I talk of\r\nsunrise--I, who am such a barbarian that I never saw the day dawn in my\r\nlife!--And to think that the French are so fond of comparing me to the\r\nrising sun! I think I had better make acquaintance with the original of\r\nwhich I hear so often that I am the copy!\"\r\n\r\nSo the queen, full of a new idea, sent for the Countessde Noailles.\r\n\"Madame,\" said she, \"can you tell me at what hour the sun rises?\"\r\n\r\n\"When the sun rises!\" exclaimed madame, who had hardly ever taken the\r\ntrouble to remember that the sun rose at all.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madame, I wish to know at what hour the sun rises; and I hope\r\nthere is nothing in your code of etiquette which forbids the Queen of\r\nFrance to aspire to a knowledge of that very commonplace fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"I regret, your majesty, that I cannot enlighten you, for I have never\r\nfelt any interest in the matter. But if you allow me, I will make the\r\nnecessary inquiries.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do so, if you please, madame.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Noailles was absent for some time. At last she returned.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your majesty, that I have been away so long. But no one in\r\nthe palace could give me the information I sought. Luckily, in passing\r\none of the corridors, I met a gardener coming in with fresh flowers for\r\nyour majesty's cabinet, and he was able to tell me. The sun rises at\r\npresent at three o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. Be so good as to make your arrangements accordingly. I shall\r\nget up at three o'clock to-morrow morning and go out upon the hillock in\r\nthe garden to see the dawn of day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty would go out into the garden at three o'clock in the\r\nmorning?\" said madame, almost fainting with horror.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madame,\" said Marie Antoinette, with decision. \"Is there any law\r\nin France to forbid me a sight of the sun at that hour?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty, for such an extraordinary demand could never have\r\nbeen presupposed. Since France was a kingdom, no Queen of France has\r\never been known to indulge a wish to see the sun rise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unhappy queens! I suppose they were so profoundly engaged in the study\r\nof your favorite code, that they had no time to admire the works of God.\r\nBut you see that I am an eccentric queen, and I would go in all humility\r\nto adore Him through one of His glorious works. And as, luckily for me,\r\netiquette has never legislated on the subject, you have no grounds for\r\nobjection, and I shall commit the astounding indiscretion of going out\r\nto see the sun rise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, your majesty must allow me to say that for all extraordinary\r\ncases not provided for in the code of etiquette, the queen must have the\r\nconsent of the king.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not concern yourself about that; I shall express my desire to the\r\nking, and that will suffice. My ladies in waiting who keep diaries can\r\nthen note, with quiet conscience, that on this day the Queen of France,\r\nwith the consent of her husband, went into the garden to see the sun\r\nrise.\"\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette slightly inclined her head, and passed into her\r\ndressing-room, there to put herself in the hands of Monsieur Leonard.\r\nThe skilful hair-dresser was in his happiest vein; and when he had\r\nachieved the great labor of his day, the queen was inexpressibly\r\ncharming.\r\n\r\nConformably to her wishes, many irksome court-customs had been laid\r\naside at Marly. The strict lines of demarcation between royalty and\r\nnobility no longer hampered the daily intercourse of the sovereigns and\r\ntheir subjects. The lords and ladies in waiting were at liberty to join\r\nthe queen's circle in the drawing-rooms, or to group themselves together\r\nas inclination prompted. Some talked over the events of the day, some\r\ndiscussed the new books which lay in heaps upon a table in one of the\r\nsaloons; others, again, played billiards with the king.\r\n\r\nTo-day the court was assembled in an apartment opening into the garden;\r\nand the queen, who had just made her appearance in all the splendor of\r\nher regal beauty, was the cynosure of attraction and of admiration. She\r\nstood in the centre of the room, her eyes fixed wistfully upon the\r\nsetting sun, whose dying rays were flooding park, terrace, and even the\r\nspot on which she stood, with a red and golden light. By her side stood\r\nthe king, his mild countenance illumined with joy and admiration of his\r\nyoung wife's surpassing loveliness. On the other side of the queen were\r\nthe princes and princesses of the blood; and around the royal group an\r\nassemblage of the youngest, prettiest, and sprightliest women of the\r\naristocracy, escorted by their cavaliers, young nobles whose rank,\r\nworth, and culture entitled them to all the favor which they enjoyed at\r\ncourt. At the head of the wits were the Count de Provence, the Count\r\nd'Artois, and their kinsman, the Duke de Chartres, known years afterward\r\nas \"Philippe Egalite.\" De Chartres and the witty Duke de Lauzun were\r\namong the most enthusiastic admirers of the queen.\r\n\r\nThe French court was in the zenith of its splendor. Youth and beauty\r\nwere the rule, age was the exception; and in the saloons of Marie\r\nAntoinette, its solitary representatives frowned through the deep and\r\nangry furrows that dented the wrinkled visage of Madame de Noailles.\r\n\r\nTo-day the high-priestess of etiquette had taken advantage of the\r\nliberty allowed to all, and had absented herself. Her absence was a\r\nsensible relief to a court where no man was older than the king, and\r\nmany a woman was as young as the queen.\r\n\r\nFor a time Marie Antoinette's glance lingered caressingly upon the\r\ngarden, through whose perfumed alleys the evening wind was rustling with\r\na sweet, low song. The court, following the mood of the queen, kept\r\nperfectly silent. Of what were they thinking? that crowd of youthful\r\ntriflers, so many of whom were hurrying to the bloody destiny which made\r\nheroes of coxcombs and heroines of coquettes\r\n\r\nSuddenly the expression of the queen's face, which had been thoughtful\r\nand solemn, changed to its usual frankness and gayety. \"Ladies and\r\ngentlemen,\" said she, in that clear, rich voice of hers, which always\r\nreminded one of little silver bells, \"I have a riddle to propose.\"\r\n\r\n\"A riddle!\" echoed the company, crowding around to hear.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a riddle, and woe to those who cannot guess it! They will be\r\nsentenced to sit up this whole night long. \"\r\n\r\n\"A severe sentence,\" said the king, with a sigh. \"May I not be one of the\r\ncondemned? Well, then, lovely sphinx, tell us your riddle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen all!\" said Marie Antoinette, \"and strain your every faculty to\r\nits solution. Princes and princesses, lords and ladies, can you tell me\r\nat what hour the sun will rise to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\nThe perplexed company looked at one another. Everybody seemed puzzled\r\nexcept the king. He alone smiled, and watched the countenances of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\"Come, gentlemen, you who are fed on the sciences--come, ladies you so\r\nexpert to guess--will none of you solve my riddle?\" tried the lively\r\nqueen. \"You, brother Philip, who know all things, have you never asked\r\nthis question of the sun?\"\r\n\r\n\"I interest myself, dear sister, in matters which concern myself, my\r\nfamily, and France,\" replied the Count de Provence, not over-pleased at\r\nthe appeal. \"The sun, which belongs to another world, has no share in my\r\nstudies or my meditations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Condemned,\" said the queen, with a merry laugh. \"No sleep for you\r\ntonight. And you, brother d'Artois, who are such a devotee of beauty,\r\nhave you never worshipped at the shrine of solar magnificence?\"\r\n\r\n\"The sun rose in this room, your majesty, about a quarter of an hour\r\nago,\" said Count d'Artois, bowing. \"I can, therefore, safely say that in\r\nthe chateau of Marly it usually rises at eight o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Compliments will not save you, D'Artois; you shall not go to sleep this\r\nnight. And what say you, my sisters-in-law, and our dear Elizabeth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we dare not be wiser than our husbands!\" said the Countess de\r\nProvence, quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Then you shall share their fate,\" returned Marie Antoinette. \"And now,\"\r\ncontinued she, \"cousin de Chartres, it is said that your merry-making\r\nsometimes lasts until morning. You, then, must be intimately acquainted\r\nwith the habits of the rising sun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ma foi,\" said the duke, with a careless laugh, \"your majesty is right.\r\nMy vigils are frequent; but if returning thence, I have ever met with\r\nthe sun, I have mistaken it for a street-lantern, and have never given a\r\nsecond thought to the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody, then, in this aristocratic assemblage, knows aught about the\r\nrising of the sun,\" said the queen.\r\n\r\nA profound silence greeted the remark. The queen's face grew pensive,\r\nand gradually deepened into sadness.\r\n\r\n\"All!\" exclaimed she, with a sigh, \"what egotists we are in high life!\r\nWe expect heaven to shield and sustain us in our grandeur, and never a\r\nthought do we return to heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I not to be allowed the privilege of guessing, madame?\" asked the\r\nking.\r\n\r\n\"You, sire!\" said Marie Antoinette. \"It does not become the king's\r\nsubjects to put questions to him, which he might not be able to answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, I request your majesty to give me a trial.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, sire. Can you read my riddle, and tell me at what hour the\r\nsun will rise to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty. The sun will rise at three o'clock,\" said Louis,\r\nwith a triumphant smile.\r\n\r\nEverybody wondered. Marie Antoinette laughed her silvery laugh, and\r\nclapped her little white hands with joy. \"Bravo, bravo, my royal\r\nOEdipus!\" cried she, gayly. \"The sphinx is overcome; but she will not\r\nthrow herself into the sea just yet. She is too happy to bend the knee\r\nbefore her husband's erudition.\"\r\n\r\nWith bewitching grace, the queen inclined her beautiful head and knelt\r\nbefore the king. But Louis, blushing with gratification, clasped her\r\nhands in his, and raised her tenderly to her feet.\r\n\r\n\"Madame,\" said he, \"if I had the tact and wit of my brother Charles, I\r\nwould say that the sun, which so lately has risen, must not set so soon\r\nupon its worshippers. But answer me one question--what is the meaning\r\nof the riddle with which your majesty has been entertaining us?\"\r\n\r\n\"May I answer with another question? Tell me, sire, have you ever seen\r\nthe sun rise?\"\r\n\r\n\"I? No, your majesty. I confess that I never have.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, ladies and gentlemen?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can answer for all that they have not,\" laughed D'Artois.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sire,\" said the queen, again addressing her husband, \"tell me one\r\nthing. Is it unseemly for a Queen of France to see the sun rise?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not,\" answered the king, laughing heartily.\r\n\r\n\"Then will your majesty allow me to enjoy that privilege?\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me, madame, that you have no consent to ask save that of\r\nyour own bright eyes. If they promise to remain open all night, you have\r\nno one to consult on the subject but yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank your majesty,\" said the queen. \"And now, as none of the company\r\nwere able to solve my riddle, all must prepare to sit up with me. May I\r\nhope, sire, that you will be magnanimous enough to relinquish the right\r\nyou have earned to retire, and afford me the happiness of your presence\r\nalso?\"\r\n\r\nLouis looked quite discomfited, and was about to stammer out some\r\nawkward reply, when the marshal of the household threw open the doors of\r\nthe banquet-hall, and approaching the king, cried out, \"Le roi est\r\nservi.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said he, much relieved, \"let us refresh ourselves for the vigil.\"\r\n\r\nDinner over, the company promenaded in the gardens for an hour, and then\r\nreturned to the drawing-room to await the compulsory privilege of seeing\r\nthe sun rise. Marie Antoinette, with the impatience of a child, was\r\ncontinually going out upon the terrace to see how the night waned; but\r\nthe moon was up, and the gardens of Marly were bathed in a silver lizht\r\nthat was any thing but indicative of the dawn of day.\r\n\r\nThe scene was so calm and lovely, that the young queen returned to the\r\ndrawing-room in search of the king, hoping to woo him to the enjoyment\r\nof the beautiful nature, which was elevating her thoughts far above the\r\nkingdoms of earth and peacefully leading her heart to Heaven. But the\r\nking was nowhere to be seen, and as she was seeking him first in one\r\nroom, then in another, she met the Count de Provence.\r\n\r\n\"I am charged, madame,\" said he, \"with an apology from the king. His\r\nmajesty begs that you will pardon him for making use of his right to\r\nretire. He hopes that your majesty will not enjoy your night the less\r\nfor his absence.\" [Footnote: Campan vol. i., p 38]\r\n\r\nThe queen colored to her brows, and her expressive face gave token of\r\nserious annoyance. She was about to dismiss the company, saying that she\r\nhad changed her mind, but she remembered that by so doing she might\r\nbecome the subject of the ridicule of the court. Her pride whispered her\r\nto remain, and smothered her instinctive sense of propriety. She looked\r\nanxiously around for Madame de Noailles, but on the first occasion, when\r\nher advice might have been welcome, she was absent. She had been told\r\nthat etiquette had nothing to do with the queen's party of pleasure, and\r\nshe, like the king, had retired to rest.\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette then motioned to her first lady of honor, the Princess\r\nde Chimay, and requested her to say to Madame de Noailles that her\r\npresence would be required in the drawing-room at two o'clock, when the\r\ncourt would set out for the hill, from whence they would witness the\r\ndawn of the morrow.\r\n\r\n\"It is an unconscionable time coming,\" yawned the Countess de Provence.\r\n\"See, my dear sister, the hand of the clock points to midnight. What are\r\nwe to do in the interim?\" asked she, peevishly.\r\n\r\n\"Propose something to while away the time,\" said the queen, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Let us depute D'Artois to do it. He is readier at such things than the\r\nrest of us,\" said the princess.\r\n\r\n\"Does your majesty second the proposal?\" asked D'Artois.\r\n\r\n\"I do with all my heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the thoughtless prince, \"I propose that we play the most\r\ninnocent and rollicking of games--blindman's buff.\" [Footnote: Campan,\r\nvol. i., p. 95.]\r\n\r\nA shout of laughter, in which the young queen joined, was the response\r\nto this proposition.\r\n\r\n\"I was charged with the duty of relieving the tedium of the court,\"\r\ncontinued the prince gravely. \"I once more propose the exciting game of\r\nblindman's buff.\" [Footnote: This game was frequently played in the\r\ncourtly circles, and not only in aristocratic houses, but in all social\r\ngatherings. It became the fashion. Madame de Gonlis, who was fond of\r\nscourging the follies of her day, made this fashion the subject of one\r\nof her dramas.]\r\n\r\n\"We are bound to accede,\" replied the queen, forgetting her\r\nembarrassment of the moment before. \"Let us try to recall the happy days\r\nof our childhood. Let us play blindman's buff until the sun rises and\r\ntransforms the children of the night once more into earnest and\r\nreasoning mortals.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CII.\r\n\r\nTHE FOLLOWING DAY.\r\n\r\nThe queen was alone in her cabinet, which she had not left since she had\r\nseen the sun rise. She had taken cold in the garden, and as a souvenir\r\nof the event, had carried home a fever and a cough. But it was not\r\nindisposition alone which blanched her cheeks. Something mightier than\r\nfever glowed in her flashing eyes, something more painful than malady\r\nthrew that deadly paleness over her sweet, innocent face. From time to\r\ntime she glanced at a paper lying on the table before her, and every\r\ntime her eye fell upon it her brow grow darker.\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door. She started, and murmuring--\"The\r\nking!\"--she flung her handkerchief over the papers, and throwing back\r\nher head, compelled herself to calmness; while her husband, lifting the\r\nsilken portiere, advanced toward the table. She tried to rise, but Louis\r\ncame hastily to prevent it, saying: \"I come to make inquiries concerning\r\nyour health; but if my presence is to disturb you, I shall retire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Remain, then, sire--I will not rise,\" said the queen, with a languid\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"Are you still suffering?\" said Louis.\r\n\r\n\"Only from a cold, sire; it will pass away.\"\r\n\r\n\"A cold, for which you are indebted to the chill night-air. It would\r\nappear that the Queens of France, who lived and died without seeing the\r\nsun rise, were not so stupid, after all.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen gave a searching look at the king's face, and saw that it was\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\n\"I went with your majesty's consent.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe that I was wrong to give it,\" returned he, thoughtfully; \"I\r\nshould have remembered that for a hundred years past the court of France\r\nhas been so corrupt that unhappily the French nation have lost all faith\r\nin chastity and purity of heart. You, madame, must teach them to\r\ndistinguish the innocence which has nothing to conceal, from the\r\ndepravity which has lost all shame. But we must be cautious, and so\r\nconduct ourselves, that our actions may be beyond misconstruction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty wishes me to infer that my harmless desire to behold one\r\nof the glorious works of my Maker, has been misinterpreted?\" said the\r\nqueen, opening her large eyes full upon her husband.\r\n\r\nThe king avoided her glance.\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said he, with embarrassment. \"I speak not of what has been,\r\nbut of what might be.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this most innocent of wishes has inspired your majesty with these\r\napprehensions?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not say so, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"But your majesty knows that it is so,\" cried the queen. \"It is very\r\ngenerous of you to save my feelings by concealing that which you know\r\nmust subject me to mortification; but others here are less magnanimous\r\nthan you, sire. I have already seen the obscene libel to which my\r\npleasure party has given birth. I have read 'Le lever de l'aurore.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Who has dared to insult you by the sight of it?\" asked Louis,\r\nindignantly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sire,\" said Marie Antoinette, bitterly, \"there are always good\r\nfriends, who are ready to wound us with the weapons of others. I found\r\nthe lampoon on my table this morning, among my letters.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall not be exposed to a repetition of this. Campan shall look\r\nover your papers before he presents them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I am likely to find them often, sire? I hope not. But be\r\nthat as it may, I am no coward. I have courage to face any amount of\r\ncalumny--for my heart is pure, and my life will vindicate me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will, indeed,\" said the king, tenderly. \"But you must keep aloof\r\nfrom the poisonous atmosphere of slander. We must live less among the\r\nmultitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, sire, how can we keep aloof from those who have the right to be\r\nnear us?\"\r\n\r\nThe king started, almost imperceptibly, and his anxious glance rested\r\nupon his wife's honest, truthful eyes. Removing her handkerchief, she\r\npointed to a paper.\r\n\r\n\"This is the envelope in which I found 'Le lever de l'aurore.' The\r\nhandwriting is disguised; but tell me frankly if you do not recognize\r\nit. _I_ do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--really--I may be mistaken,\" began the king, \"but--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, you see that it is the hand of the Count de Provence, your own\r\nbrother, sire. He it is, who enjoys the cruel satisfaction of having\r\nforced this indecent libel upon my notice, and I doubt not for one\r\nmoment that he also is the one who sent it to you. \"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, no doubt, he did it to warn us, and we must be grateful and take\r\nthe warning to our hearts.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen laughed scornfully.\r\n\r\n\"Does your majesty suppose that these drawings were made with the same\r\nbenevolent intention?\" said she, handing him a second paper. \"Look at\r\nthese indecent caricatures, made still more obnoxious by the vulgar\r\nobservations attached to them. There is no disguise of his handwriting\r\nhere, for this was not intended for my eye. \"\r\n\r\n\"Too true,\" sighed the king--\"the drawings and the writing are both my\r\nbrother's. But who can have sent you these shameful sketches?\"\r\n\r\n\"I told you just now, sire, that there are always people to be found,\r\nwho stab their friends with borrowed weapons. The drawings were\r\naccompanied by a letter, informing me, that they were executed in the\r\nsaloons of Madame Adelaide, and that the remarks were the joint\r\nproductions of your majesty's brother and your aunts.\"\r\n\r\nThe king passed his handkerchief over his forehead, to dry the heavy\r\ndrops of sweat that were gathering there, and rose up, with the paper in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n\"Where is your majesty going?\" asked the queen.\r\n\r\n\"To my brother,\" cried he, indignantly. \"I will show him this\r\ndisgraceful paper, and ask by what right he outrages my wife and his\r\nqueen! I shall tell him that his actions are those of a traitor and--\"\r\n\r\n\"And when you have told him that, will you punish him as kings punish\r\ntraitors?\"\r\n\r\nThe king was silent, and the queen continued, with a sad smile.\r\n\r\n\"You could not punish him; for the traitor who outrages the queen is the\r\nbrother of the king, and, therefore, he can outrage with impunity.\"\r\n\r\n\"He shall not do it with impunity! I will force him to honor and love\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, sire, love will not yield to force,\" said Marie Antoinette, in\r\natone of anguish. \"Were I as pure as an angel, the Count de Provence\r\nwould hate me for my Austrian birth, and Madame Adelaide would use the\r\ngreat influence she possesses over your majesty to rob me of the little\r\nfavor I am gaining in your sight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Antoinette, do you not feel that my whole heart is yours?\" said\r\nLouis, affectionately. \"Believe me, when I say that it is in the power\r\nof no human being to sully your sweet image in my eyes. Do not fear the\r\nroyal family. I am here to protect you, and, soon or late, your worth\r\nwill overcome their prejudices.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sire, no. Nothing will ever win me their regard. But I am resolved\r\nto brave their emnity, satisfied that, in the eyes of the world, my\r\nconduct and my conscience both will sustain me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your husband also,\" said the king, kissing her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Sire, I hope so,\" said Marie Antoinette, in a tremulous voice. \"And\r\nnow,\" continued she, dashing away the tear-drops that were gathering in\r\nher eyes, \"now give me those caricatures. They have served to convince\r\nyour majesty that I know my enemies--and defy them. Their mission is\r\naccomplished; let us try to forget their existence.\"\r\n\r\nShe took the drawings from his hand, and, tearing them to pieces,\r\nscattered them over the carpet. The king picked up a few of the\r\nfragments.\r\n\r\n\"Will you allow me to retain these as a souvenir of this hour?\" said he,\r\ngazing fondly upon her sweet face.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, sire.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you know that princes can never receive a gift without returning\r\none. Therefore, do me the favor to accept this. It is paper for paper. \"\r\n\r\nHe drew from his bosom a little package, to which the royal seal was\r\naffixed, and Marie Antoinette took it, with a glance of surprise.\r\n\r\n\"What can it be?\" said she, as she unfolded it.\r\n\r\nHe watched her as she read; and thought how beautiful she was, as,\r\nblushing and smiling, she held out her hand to thank him.\r\n\r\n\"How, sire,\" said she, joyfully, \"you make me this royal gift?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you will accept it. The chateau de Trianon is a small estate, but\r\nits mistress may at least find it a home where she will have liberty to\r\nenjoy nature without exciting the malevolence of her enemies. No one can\r\nwatch you there, Antoinette; for your castle is not large enough to\r\nlodge your slanderers. It will scarcely accommodate your friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I ever thank you, sire?\" said she, in grateful accents. \"You\r\nhave understood my heart, and have gratified its weary longings for\r\noccasional solitude. This, then, is my own private domain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I may rule there without interference from state or etiquette?\"\r\n\r\n\"Assuredly. As chatelaine of Trianon, you alone will regulate its\r\ncustoms, and all who visit you, must submit to your rules.\"\r\n\r\n\"And no man can enter my chateau without an invitation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not even the king himself.\"\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette smiled until the pearls encased within her coral lips\r\ndazzled the royal vision.\r\n\r\n\"How delightful!\" said she. \"I do not think that the Count de Provence\r\nwill ever be invited to Trianon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I,\" replied Louis.\r\n\r\n\"But the king will be asked so often, that he will certainly wish he\r\nwere the Count de Provence. Still, he must promise not to come until he\r\nreceives his invitation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise, beautiful chatelaine.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then to come whenever I invite him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I can promise more safely than the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon your royal word?\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon my royal word. And thus I seal it with a kiss upon your fair\r\nhand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon my hand only, sire?\" asked she, while she turned a cheek, whose\r\nhue was like the rosy lining of a sea-shell.\r\n\r\nLouis accepted the challenge, and pressed a kiss so passionate upon that\r\ncheek, that it flushed to a deep, burning crimson, and the queen's eyes\r\nwere cast down, till nothing of them was visible except her long, dark\r\nlashes.\r\n\r\nThe royal lover, too, grew very red, and stammered a few inaudible\r\nwords. Then bowing, awkwardly, he stumbled over an armchair, and\r\nretreated in dire confusion.\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette looked after her clumsy king with a beating heart.\r\n\r\n\"Am I, indeed, to be blessed with his love?\" thought the poor, young\r\nthing. \"If I am, I shall be the happiest and most enviable of women.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CIII.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST APPEAL.\r\n\r\nThe carriage of the Countess Esterhazy was returning from a ball which\r\nthe empress had given in honor of her son's departure from Vienna.\r\nJoseph was about to visit France, and his lovely young sister was once\r\nmore to hear the sound of a beloved voice from home.\r\n\r\nIt was long past midnight; but the Hotel Esterhazy was one blaze of\r\nlight. It had been one of the countess's first orders to her steward\r\nthat, at dusk, every chandelier in her palace should be lighted. She\r\nhated night and darkness, she said, and must have hundreds of wax-lights\r\nburning from twilight until morning. This was one of the whims of the\r\nfair Margaret, which, although it amused all Vienna, was any thing but\r\ncomic to her husband, for it cost him one thousand florins a month.\r\n\r\nThe hotel, then, from ground-floor to attic, was bright as noon-day. Six\r\nlackeys, in silvered livery, stood on either side of the entrance, with\r\ntorches in their hands, to light their lady to the vestibule. From the\r\ninner door to the staircase a rich Turkey carpet covered the floor; and,\r\nhere again, stood twelve more lackeys, performing the office of\r\ncandelabra to the light-loving countess. At the foot of the stairs stood\r\nthe steward and the butler of the household, awaiting such orders as she\r\nmight choose to fling at them on her way; and at the head of the stairs,\r\nwaiting to receive her, stood a bevy of dames de compagnie, and other\r\nfemale attendants.\r\n\r\nThe countess passed through this living throng without vouchsafing one\r\nglance in acknowledgment of their respectful greetings. In profound\r\nsilence she swept up the stairway; her long, glossy train of white satin\r\nfollowing her as she went, like the foaming track that a ship leaves\r\nupon the broad bosom of the ocean, and the diamonds that decked her\r\nbrow, neck, and arms, flinging showers of radiance that dazzled the eye\r\nlike lightning when the storm is at its height. Her head was thrown\r\nback, her large black eyes were starry as ever, and her face was so pale\r\nthat its pallor was unearthly.\r\n\r\nAt the landing-place she turned, and speaking to the steward, said:\r\n\r\n\"Let Count Esterhazy know that in ten minutes I await him in the blue\r\nroom.\" Having said thus much, she continued her way, and disappeared\r\nfrom the eyes of her staring household.\r\n\r\nHer disappearance was the signal for the transformation of the\r\ncandelabra into men.\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear her?\" whispered one. \"She has sent for the count.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never troubling herself whether he sleeps or wakes,\" said another.\r\n\"Poor man! He has been in bed for four hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"No wonder he goes to bed early,\" remarked a third. \"It is the only\r\nplace on earth where he has peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless he will be obedient and come; he dare not refuse.\" \"Oh,\r\nno!\" was the general response. \"In ten minutes he will be here; or his\r\namiable countess will treat us to a scene like some we have witnessed,\r\nwherein she flings handfuls of gold out of the windows, and gathers all\r\nthe people in Vienna before the hotel to see the show. \"\r\n\r\nThe servants were right; Count Esterhazy did not disobey his wife. He\r\ntrembled when he received her message, called nervously for his valet to\r\ndress him, and at the end of the ten minutes was on his way to the\r\nblue-room.\r\n\r\nThe countess was there before him, looking like an angry queen about to\r\ncondemn a recreant vassal to death. And Esterhazy, with the mien and\r\ngait of a culprit, carne into her presence with a bow that was almost a\r\ngenuflection.\r\n\r\n\"You see, countess,\" said he, \"with what haste I obey your commands. I\r\nfeel so honored at the call, that--\"\r\n\r\nHe paused--for really her fiery eyes seemed to burn him; and her\r\ncontempt dried up the stream of his commonplace flattery, as the breath\r\nof the sirocco parches up the dew-drops.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you not go on?\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"I am bewildered by my own joy,\" replied he, blandly. \"Remember--it is\r\nthe first time since our marriage that you have allowed me the privilege\r\nof an interview in private; and I may well lose my speech in the\r\nintoxication of such a moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the first time. You have a good memory. Can you also recollect\r\nhow long it is since we had that interview?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I recollect? Four long years!\"\r\n\r\n\"Four long years,\" sighed she, \"to the day, and almost to the hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" exclaimed the count. \"And can you forgive me for having\r\nforgotten this charming anniversary?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are happy to have tasted of the Lethe of indifference. I--I have\r\ncounted the days and the hours of my slavery; and each day and hour is\r\nbranded upon my heart. Have you forgotten, too, Count Esterhazy, what I\r\nswore to you on that wedding-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Margaret--I have forgotten all the cruel words you spoke to me in\r\nan outburst of just indignation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder that you should have forgotten them, for it has been my daily\r\ncare to remind you of the vow I then made. Have I not kept my word? Have\r\nI not crossed your path with the burning ploughshares of my hatred? Have\r\nI not cursed your home, wasted your wealth and made you the\r\nlaughing-stock of all Vienna?\"\r\n\r\n\"You judge yourself with too much severity, Margaret,\" said the count,\r\nmildly. \"True--we have not been very happy; since this is the first time\r\nsince our marriage-night, that we are face to face without witnesses. I\r\nwill not deny, either, that our household expenditures have cost several\r\nmillions, and have greatly exceeded our income. But the lovely Countess\r\nEsterhazy has a right to exceed all other women in the splendor of her\r\nconcerts and balls, and the richness of her dress. Come, make me amends\r\nfor the past--I forgive you. There is still time to--\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" exclaimed she, \"the time went by four years ago. You can never\r\nmake amends to me, nor I to you. Look at yourself! You were then a young\r\nman, with high hopes and a light heart. Many a woman would have been\r\nproud to be called your wife--and yet you chose me. Now, that four years\r\nof accursed wedded life have gone over your head, you have passed from\r\nyouth to old age, without ever having known an interval of manhood. And\r\nI--O God! What have I become through your miserable cowardice! I might\r\nhave grown to be a gentle woman, had fate united me to him whom I love;\r\nbut the link that has bound me to you has unsexed me. Our marriage was a\r\ncrime, and we have paid its penalty; you are as weak as a woman, and\r\nI--as inflexible as a man.\"\r\n\r\nTwo large tears glittered in her eyes, and fell slowly down her pale\r\ncheeks. Count Esterhazy approached and caressed her with his hands. She\r\nshuddered at his touch, recoiling as if from contact with a reptile.\r\nMeanwhile, he was imploring her to begin a new life with him--to give\r\nhim her hand, to make him the happiest of men.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no!\" cried she. \"In mercy cease, or you will drive me mad. But\r\nI will forgive you even your past treachery, if you will grant the\r\nrequest I am about to make.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will condescend to ask something of me! Speak, Margaret speak! What\r\ncan I do to make you happy?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can give me my freedom,\" replied the countess, in a soft, imploring\r\nvoice. \"Go with me to the empress, and beg her to undo what she has\r\ndone. Tell her that she has blasted the lives of two human beings--tell\r\nher that we are two galley-slaves, pining for liberty.\"\r\n\r\nCount Esterhazy shook his head. \"The empress will never allow us to be\r\ndivorced,\" said he, \"for I have too often assured her that I was happy\r\nbeyond expression, and she wouldn't believe me if I came with another\r\nstory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let us go to the fountain head,\" said the countess, wringing her\r\nhands. \"Let us go to the pope, and implore him to loose the bands of our\r\nmutual misery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible! That would be a slight which the empress never would\r\nforgive. I should fall under her displeasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, these servile hearts that have no life but that which they borrow\r\nfrom the favor of princes!\" cried Margaret, scornfully. \"What has the\r\nfavor of the empress been worth to you? For what have you to thank her?\r\nFor these four years of martyrdom, which you have spent with a woman who\r\ndespises you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot dispense with the good-will of my sovereign,\" said the count,\r\nwith something like fervor. \"For hundreds of years, the Esterhazys have\r\nbeen the favorites of the Emperors of Austria; and we cannot afford to\r\nlose the station we enjoy therefrom. No--I will do nothing to irritate\r\nthe empress. She chose you for my wife, and, therefore, I wear my chains\r\npatiently. Maria Theresa knows how I have obeyed and honored her\r\ncommands; and, one of these days, I shall reap the reward of my loyalty.\r\nIf Count Palfy dies, I am to be marshal of the imperial household; but\r\nyet higher honors await us both. If I continue to deserve the favor of\r\nthe empress, she will confer upon me the title of 'prince.' You refuse\r\nto be my wife, Margaret; but you will one day be proud to let me deck\r\nthat haughty brow with the coronet of a princess.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret looked more contemptuously at him than before.\r\n\r\n\"You are even more degraded than I had supposed,\" said she. \"Poor,\r\ncrawling reptile, I do not even pity you. I ask you for the last time,\r\nwill you go with me to Rome to obtain a divorce?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you repeat your unreasonable request, Margaret? It is vain for\r\nyou to hope for a divorce. Waste my fortune if you will--I cannot\r\nhinder you--I will find means to repair my losses; and the empress,\r\nherself, will come to my assistance, for--\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough!\" interrupted the countess. \"Since you will not aid me in\r\nprocuring our divorce, it shall be forced upon you. I will draw across\r\nyour escutcheon such a bar sinister as your princely coronet will not be\r\nlarge enough to hide. That is my last warning to you. Now leave me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Margaret, I implore you to forgive me if I cannot make this great\r\nsacrifice. I cannot part from you, indeed I cannot,\" began the count.\r\n\r\n\"And the empress will reward your constancy with the title of 'prince,\"'\r\nreplied Margaret, with withering scorn. \"Go--you are not worthy of my\r\nanger--but I shall know where to strike. Away with you!\"\r\n\r\nCount Esterhazy, with a deep sigh, turned and left the room.\r\n\r\n\"The last hope to which I clung, has vanished!\" said she, \"and I must\r\nresort to disgrace!\"\r\n\r\nShe bent her head, and a shower of tears came to her relief. But they\r\ndid not soften her heart. She rose from her seat, muttering, \"It is too\r\nlate to weep! I have no alternative. The hour for revenge has struck!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CIV.\r\n\r\nTHE FLIGHT.\r\n\r\nThe countess passed into her dressing-room. She closed and locked the\r\ndoor, then, going across the room, she stopped before a large picture\r\nthat hung opposite to her rich Venetian toilet-mirror. The frame of this\r\npicture was ornamented with small gilt rosettes. Margaret laid her hand\r\nupon one of these rosettes, and drew it toward her. A noise of machinery\r\nwas heard behind the wall. She drew down the rosette a second time, and\r\nthen stepped back. The whirr was heard again, the picture began to move,\r\nand behind it appeared a secret door. Margaret opened it, and, as she\r\ndid so, her whole frame shook as if with a deadly repugnance to that\r\nwhich was within.\r\n\r\n\"I am here, Count Schulenberg,\" said she, coldly.\r\n\r\nThe figure of a young man appeared at the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"May I presume to enter paradise?\" said he, stepping into the room with\r\na flippant air.\r\n\r\n\"You may,\" replied she, without moving; but the hue of shame overspread\r\nher face, neck, and arms, and it was plain to Count Schulenberg that she\r\ntrembled violently.\r\n\r\nThese were to him the signals of his triumph; and he smiled with\r\nsatisfaction as he surveyed this lovely woman, so long acknowledged to\r\nbe the beauty par excellence of the imperial court at Vienna. Margaret\r\nallowed him to take her hand, and stood coldly passive, while he covered\r\nit with kisses; but when he would have gone further, and put his arm\r\naround her waist, she raised her hands, and receded.\r\n\r\n\"Not here,\" murmured she, hoarsely. \"Not here, in the house of the man\r\nwhose name I bear. Let us not desecrate love; enough that we defile\r\nmarriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, then, beloved, come,\" said he, imploringly. \"The coach is at the\r\ndoor, and I have passes for France, Italy, Spain, and England. Choose\r\nyourself the spot wherein we shall bury our love from the world's gaze.\"\r\n\r\n\"We go to Paris,\" replied she, turning away her head.\r\n\r\n\"To Paris, dearest? Why, you have forgotten that the emperor leaves for\r\nParis to-morrow, and that we incur the risk of recognition there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all--Paris is a large city, and if we are discovered, I shall\r\nseek protection from the emperor. He knows of my unhappy marriage, and\r\nsympathizes with my sorrows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you are right, dearest. Then in Paris we spend our honey-moon,\r\nand there enjoy the bliss of requited love.\"\r\n\r\n\"There, and not until we reach there,\" said she, gravely. \"I require a\r\nlast proof of your devotion, count. I exact that until we arrive in\r\nParis you shall not speak to me of love. You shall consider me as a\r\nsister, and allow me the privilege of travelling in the carriage with my\r\nmaid--she and I on one seat, you opposite.\"\r\n\r\n\"Margaret, that is abominable tyranny. You expect me to be near you, and\r\nnot to speak of love! I must be watched by your maid, and sit opposite\r\nto you!--You surely cannot mean what you say.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do, indeed, Count Schulenberg.\"\r\n\r\n\"But think of all that I have endured for a year that I have adored you,\r\ncold beauty! Not one single proof of love have you ever given me yet.\r\nYou have tolerated mine, but have never returned it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did I not write to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Write; yes. You wrote me to say that you would not consent to be mine\r\nunless I carried you away from Vienna. Then you went on to order our\r\nmode of travelling as you would have done had I been your husband. 'Be\r\nhere at such an hour; have your passes for various countries. Describe\r\nme therein as your sister. Come through the garden and await me at the\r\nhead of the secret stairway.' Is this a love-letter? It is a mere note\r\nof instructions. For one week I have waited for a look, a sigh, a\r\npressure of the hand; and when I come hither to take you from your home\r\nforever, you receive me as if I were a courier. No, Margaret, no--I will\r\nnot wait to speak my love until we are in Paris.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, Count Schulenberg, farewell. We have nothing more to say to one\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned to leave the room, but Schulenberg darted forward and fell at\r\nher feet. \"Margaret, beloved,\" cried he, \"give me one single word of\r\ncomfort. I thirst to know that you love me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can a woman go further than I am going at this moment?\" asked Margaret,\r\nwith a strange, hollow laugh.\r\n\r\n\"No. I acknowledge my unspeakable happiness in being the partner of your\r\nflight. But I cannot comprehend your love. It is a bitter draught in a\r\ngolden beaker.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then do not drink it,\" said she, retreating.\r\n\r\n\"I must--I must drink it; for my soul thirsts for the cup, and I will\r\naccept its contents.\"\r\n\r\n\"My conditions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, since I must,\" said Schulenberg, heaving a sigh. \"I promise, then,\r\nto contain my ecstasy until we reach Paris, and to allow that guardian\r\nof virtue, your maid, to sit by your side, while I suffer agony\r\nopposite. But oh! when we reach Paris--\"\r\n\r\n\"In Paris we will talk further, and my speech shall be different.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, beloved,\" cried the count passionately. \"This heavenly\r\npromise will sustain me through my ordeal.\" He kissed the tips of her\r\nfingers, and she retired to change her ball-dress for a travelling\r\nhabit.\r\n\r\nWhen she had closed the door, the expression of Count Schulenberg's face\r\nwas not quite the same.\r\n\r\n\"The fierce countess is about to be tamed,\" thought he. \"I shall win my\r\nbet, and humble this insolent beauty. Let her rule if she must, until we\r\nreach Paris; but there I will repay her, and her chains shall not be\r\nlight. Really, this is a piquant adventure. I am making a delightful\r\nwedding-tour, without the bore of the marriage-ceremony, at the expense\r\nof the most beautiful woman in Europe; and to heighten the piquancy of\r\nthe affair, I am to receive two thousand louis d'ors on my return to\r\nVienna. Here she comes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am ready,\" said Margaret, coming in, followed by her maid, who held\r\nher mistress's travelling-bag.\r\n\r\nCount Schulenberg darted forward to offer his arm, but she waved him\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\"Follow me,\" said she, passing at once through the secret opening.\r\nSchulenberg followed, \"sighing like a furnace,\" and looking daggers at\r\nthe confidante, who in her turn looked sneeringly at him. A few moments\r\nafter they entered the carriage. The windows of the Hotel Esterhazy were\r\nas brilliantly illuminated as ever, while the master of the house\r\nslumbered peacefully. And yet a shadow had fallen upon the proud\r\nescutcheon which surmounted the silken curtains of his luxurious\r\nbed--the shadow of that disgrace with which his outraged wife had\r\nthreatened him!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CV.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH IN FRANCE.\r\n\r\nA long train of travelling carriages was about to cross the bridge which\r\nspans the Rhine at Strasburg, and separates Germany from France. It was\r\nthe suite of the Count of Falkenstein, who was on his way to visit his\r\nroyal sister.\r\n\r\nThirty persons, exclusive of Count Rosenberg and two other confidential\r\nfriends, accompanied the emperor. Of course, the incognito of a Count of\r\nFalkenstein, who travelled with such a suite, was not of much value to\r\nhim; so that he had endured all the tedium of an official journey. This\r\nwas all very proper in the eyes of Maria Theresa, who thought it\r\nimpossible for Jove to travel without his thunder. But Jove himself, as\r\neverybody knows, was much addicted to incognitos, and so was his terrene\r\nrepresentative, the Emperor of Austria.\r\n\r\nThe imperial cortege, then, was just about to pass from Germany to\r\nFrance. It was evening, and the fiery gold of the setting sun was\r\nmirrored in the waves of the Rhine which with gentle murmur were toying\r\nwith the greensward that sloped gracefully down to the water's edge. The\r\nemperor gave the word to halt, and rising from his seat, looked back\r\nupon the long line of carriages that followed in his wake.\r\n\r\n\"Rosenberg\" said he, laying his hand upon the count's shoulder, \"tell me\r\nfrankly how do you enjoy this way of travelling?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, sire, I have been thinking all day of the delights of our other\r\njourneys. Do you remember our hunt for dinner in the dirty little\r\nhamlet, and the nights we spent on horseback in Galicia? There was no\r\nmonotony in travelling then!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, thank you,\" said the emperor, with a bright smile. \"I see\r\nthat we are of one mind.\"\r\n\r\nHe motioned to the occupants of the carriage immediately behind him, and\r\nthey hastened to obey the signal.\r\n\r\nThe emperor, after thanking them for the manner in which they had\r\nacquitted themselves of their respective duties, proposed a change in\r\ntheir plans of travel.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" replied Herr von Bourgeois, with a sigh, \"your majesty has no\r\nfurther use for us, and we return to Vienna.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, not at all,\" said the emperor, who had heard and understood\r\nthe sigh wafted toward Paris and its thousand attractions. \"We will only\r\npart company that we may travel more at our ease, and once in Paris, we\r\nagain join forces. Be so good as to make your arrangements accordingly,\r\nand to make my adieux to the other gentlemen of our suite.\"\r\n\r\nNot long after, the imperial cortege separated into three columns, each\r\none of which was to go independent of the other, and all to unite when\r\nthey had reached Paris. As the last of the carriages with which he had\r\nparted, disappeared on the other side of the bridge the emperor drew a\r\nlong breath and looked radiant with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Let us wait,\" said he, \"until the dust of my imperial magnificence is\r\nlaid, before we cross the bridge to seek lodgings for the night.\r\nMeanwhile, Rosenberg, give me your arm and let us walk along the banks\r\nof the Rhine.\"\r\n\r\nThey crossed the high-road and took a foot-path that led to the banks of\r\nthe river. At that evening hour every thing was peaceful and quiet. Now\r\nand then a peasant came slowly following his hay-laden wagon, and\r\noccasionally some village-girl carolled a love-lay, or softly murmured a\r\nvesper hymn.\r\n\r\nThe emperor, who had been walking fast, suddenly stopped, and gazed with\r\nrapture upon the scene.\r\n\r\n\"See, Rosenberg,\" said he, \"see how beautiful Germany is to-day! As\r\nbeautiful as a laughing youth upon whose brow is stamped the future\r\nhero.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty will transform the boy into a hero,\" said Rosenberg.\r\n\r\nThe emperor frowned. \"Let us forget for a moment the mummery of\r\nroyalty,\" said he. \"You know, moreover, that royalty has brought me\r\nnothing but misery. Instead of reigning over others, I am continually\r\npassing under the Caudine Forks of another's despotic will.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the day will come when the emperor shall reign alone, and then the\r\nsun of greatness will rise for Germany.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven grant it! I have the will to make of Germany one powerful\r\nempire. Oh, that I had the power, too! My friend, we are alone, and no\r\none hears except God. Here on the confines of Germany, the poor unhappy\r\nemperor may be permitted to shed a tear over the severed garment of\r\nGerman royalty--that garment which has been rent by so many little\r\nprinces! Have you observed, Rosenberg, how they have soiled its majesty?\r\nHave you noticed the pretensions of these manikins whose domains we can\r\nspan with our hands? Is it not pitiable that each one in his\r\nprincipality is equal in power to the Emperor of Austria!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Rosenberg with a sigh, \"Germany swarms with little\r\nprinces!\"\r\n\r\n\"Too many little princes,\" echoed Joseph, \"and therefore their lord and\r\nemperor is curtailed by so much of his own lawful rights, and Germany is\r\nan empty name among nations! If the Germans were capable of an\r\nenlightened patriotism; if they would throw away their Anglomania,\r\nGallonmania, Prussomania, and Austromania, they would be something more\r\nthan the feeble echoes of intriguers and pedants.[Footnote: The\r\nemperor's own words. See \"Joseph II., Correspondence,\" p. 176.] Each one\r\nthrusts his own little province forward, while all forget the one great\r\nfatherland!\"\r\n\r\n\"But the Emperor Joseph will be lord of all Germany,\" cried Rosenberg,\r\nexultingly, \"and he will remind them that they are vassals and he is\r\ntheir suzerain!\"\r\n\r\n\"They must have a bloody lesson to remind them of that,\" said the\r\nemperor, moodily. \"Look behind you, Rosenberg, on the other side of the\r\nRhine. There lies a kingdom neither larger nor more populous than\r\nGermany; a kingdom which rules us by its industry and caprices, and is\r\ngreat by reason of its unity, because its millions of men are under the\r\nsway of one monarch.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet it was once with France as it is to-day with Germany,\" said\r\nCount Rosenberg. \"There were Normandy, Brittany, Provence, Languedoc,\r\nBurgundy, and Franche-Comte, all petty dukedoms striving against their\r\nallegiance to the king. Where are their rulers now? Buried and\r\nforgotten, while their provinces own the sway of the one monarch who\r\nrules all France. What France has accomplished, Germany, too, can\r\ncompass.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor placed his hand affectionately upon Rosenberg's shoulder.\r\n\"You have read my heart, friend,\" said he, smiling. \"Do you know what\r\nwild wishes are surging within me now? wishes which Frederick of Prussia\r\nwould condemn as unlawful, although it was quite righteous for him to\r\nrob Austria of Silesia. I, too, have my Silesia, and, by the Lord above\r\nme! my title-deeds are not as mouldy as his!\"\r\n\r\n\"Only that your Silesia is called Bavaria,\" said Rosenberg, with a\r\nsignificant smile.\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake,\" cried Joseph, \"do not let the rushes hear you, lest\r\nthey betray me to the babbling wind, and the wind bear it to the King of\r\nPrussia. But you have guessed. Bavaria is a portion of my Silesia, but\r\nonly a portion. Bavaria is mine by right of inheritance, and I shall\r\ntake it when the time comes. It will be a comely patch to stop some of\r\nthe rents in my imperial mantle. But my Silesia lies at every point of\r\nthe compass. To the east lie Bosnia and Servia--to the south, see\r\nsuperannuated Venice. The lion of St. Mark is old and blind, and will\r\nfall an easy prey to the eagle of Hapsburg, This will extend our\r\ndominions to the Adriatic sea. When the Duke of Modena is gathered to\r\nhis fathers, my brother, in right of his wife, succeeds to the title;\r\nand as Ferrara once belonged to the house of Modena, he and I together\r\ncan easily wrest it from the pope. Close by are the Tortonese and\r\nAlessandria, two fair provinces which the King of Sardinia supposes to\r\nbe his. They once formed a portion of the duchy of Milan; and Milan is\r\nours, with every acre of land that ever belonged to it. By Heaven, I\r\nwill have all that is mine, if it cost me a seven years' war to win it\r\nback! This is not all. Look toward the west, beyond the spires of\r\nStrasburg, where the green and fertile plains of Alsatia woo our coming.\r\nThey now belong to France, but they shall be the property of Austria.\r\nFarther on lies Lorraine. That, too, is mine, for my father's title was\r\n'Duke of Lorraine.' What is it to me that Francis the First sold his\r\nbirthright to France? All that I covet I shall annex to Austria, as\r\nsurely as Frederick wrested Silesia from me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you intend to let him keep possession of Silesia?\" asked\r\nRosenberg.\r\n\r\n\"Not if I can prevent it, but that may not be optional with me. I\r\nwill--but hush! Let us speak no more of the future; my soul faints with\r\nthirst when I think of it. Sometimes I think I see Germany pointing to\r\nher many wounds, and calling me to come and heal her lacerated body. And\r\nyet I can do nothing! I must stand with folded arms, nor wish that I\r\nwere lord of Austria; for God knows that I do not long for Maria\r\nTheresa's death. May she reign for many years; but oh! may I live to see\r\nthe day wherein I shall be sole monarch not only of Austria, but of all\r\nGermany. If it ever dawns for me, the provinces shall no longer speak\r\neach one its own language. Italians, Hungarians, and Austrians, all\r\nshall be German, and we shall have one people and one tongue. To insure\r\nthe prosperity of my empire, I will strengthen my alliance with France.\r\nI dislike the French, but I must secure their neutrality before I step\r\ninto possession of Bavaria, and assert my claims to my many-sided\r\nSilesia. Well--these are dreams; day has not yet dawned for me! The\r\nfuture Emperor of Germany is yet a vassal, and he who goes to France to\r\nday is nothing but a Count of Falkenstein. Come, let us cross the bridge\r\nthat at once unites France with Germany, and divides them one from the\r\nother.\" [Footnote: These are Joseph's own words. See \"Letters of Joseph\r\nII.,\" p. 175.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CVI.\r\n\r\nTHE GODFATHER.\r\n\r\nThere was great commotion at the post-house of the little town of Vitry.\r\nTwo maids, in their Sunday best, were transforming the public parlor of\r\nthe inn into a festive dining-room; wreathing the walls with garlands,\r\ndecking the long dining-table with flowers, and converting the huge\r\ndresser into a buffet whereon they deposited the pretty gilt china, the\r\nlarge cakes, the pastries, jellies, and confections, that were designed\r\nfor the entertainment of thirty invited guests. The landlord and\r\npostmaster, a slender little man with an excellent, good-humored face,\r\nwas hurrying from buffet to table, from table to kitchen, superintending\r\nthe servants. The cook was deep in the preparation of her roasts and\r\nwarm dishes; and at the kitchen door sat a little maiden, who, with\r\nimportant mien, was selecting the whitest and crispest leaves from a\r\nmountain of lettuce which she laid into a large gilt salad-bowl beside\r\nher; throwing the others to a delighted pig, who, like Lazarus, stood by\r\nto pick up the leavings of his betters. In the yard, at the fountain,\r\nstood the man-of-all-work, who, as butler pro tem., was washing plates\r\nand glasses; while close by, on the flags, sat the clerk of the\r\npost-office polishing and uncorking the bottles which the host had just\r\nbrought from the cellar in honor of his friends.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Etienne surveyed his notes of preparation, and gave an\r\napproving nod. His face was radiant as he returned to the house; gave\r\nanother glance of satisfaction around the dining-room, and passed into\r\nan adjoining apartment. This was the best-furnished room in the\r\npost-house; and on a soft lounge, near the window, reclined a pale\r\nyoung woman, beautifully dressed, whose vicinity to a cradle, where lay\r\na very young infant, betokened her recent recovery from confinement.\r\n\r\n\"Athanasia, my goddess,\" said Monsieur Etienne, coming in on tiptoe,\r\n\"how do you feel to-day?\"\r\n\r\nShe reached out her pale hand and answered in a languid voice: \"The\r\ndoctor says that, so far, I am doing pretty well, and, by great\r\nprecautions, I may be able, in a few weeks, to resume my household\r\nduties.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Etienne raised his eyebrows, and looked thoughtful. \"The doctor\r\nis over-anxious, my dear,\" said he: \"he exaggerates your weakness. Our\r\nlittle angel there is already three weeks old, and will be standing on\r\nhis legs before long.\"\r\n\r\n\"The doctor is more sympathizing than you, Monsieur Etienne,\" began the\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n\"My treasure,\" interrupted her husband, \"no one can wish to spare you\r\npremature exertion more than I. But I do entreat of you, my angel, to do\r\nyour best to remain with the company to-day as long as you can.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do all in my power to oblige you,\" said Madame Etienne,\r\ncondescendingly, \"and if you require it. I will sit up from first to\r\nlast.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be a great festival for us, provided no passengers arrive\r\nto-day. Good Heaven! if they should come, what could I do with them?\r\nEven the best of those we receive here are scarcely fit to introduce\r\namong our respectable guests; and then, as for post-horses, I want every\r\none of them for the company. Heaven defend us, then, from passengers,\r\nfor--oh! oh! is it possible! Can it be!\" said Etienne, interrupting\r\nhimself. \"Yes, it is the sound of a post-horn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it is some of our guests,\" suggested Madame Etienne. \"No no,\r\nfor our postilions to-day play but one air, 'Je suis pere, un pere\r\nheureux,'\" said Monsieur Etienne, listening with all his might to the\r\napproaching horn.\r\n\r\n\"It is a passenger,\" said he, despondingly, \"Athanasia, my angel, we are\r\nlost!\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Monsieur Etienne darted out of the room, as if be were\r\nrushing off to look for himself; but he stopped as soon as he had\r\nreached his front door, for there was no necessity to go farther. A dark\r\ncaleche, with three horses, dashed up to the door, while not far behind\r\ncame another chaise, whose post-horn was sounding \"Je suis pere, un pere\r\nheureux.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible?\" thought the discomfited postmaster. \"Yes, here they\r\ncome at the very moment when the guests are arriving.\"\r\n\r\nJust then another horn was heard, and \"Je suis peree, un pere heureux,\"\r\nmade the welkin ring.\r\n\r\nOn every side they came, but the unlucky passenger caleche blocked up\r\nthe passage. Monsieur Etienne, following the impulses of his heart,\r\nrushed past the strangers, and ran to greet the most important of his\r\nguests, the village curate and the pastor of the next market-place. But\r\njust then the bewildered little man remembered his duty, and darted back\r\nto the passengers.\r\n\r\nThere were two gentlemen in the carriage, and on the box, near the\r\npostilion, a third person, who had the air of a valet.\r\n\r\n\"The gentlemen wish to go on to the next stage?\" said Etienne, without\r\nopening the door.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" said one of the passengers, raising his dark-blue eyes to the\r\npost-house. \"Your house looks inviting, and we would like a room and a\r\ncosy dinner.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Etienne scarcely knew what reply to make to this untimely\r\nrequest. \"You wish to dine here--here--you would--\"\r\n\r\nDown came another post-chaise, thundering on the stones, and louder than\r\never was the sound of \"Je suis pere, un pere heureux.\"\r\n\r\nCertainly, at that moment, the song was a mockery, for Monsieur Etienne\r\nwas a most unhappy and distracted father.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, pathetically, \"oblige me by going on to the next\r\ntown. Indeed--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, will you not give us dinner?\" asked the gentleman who had spoken\r\nbefore. \"I see a number of people passing us and entering the house. How\r\nis that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, they are--that is--I am,\" stammered the landlord; then suddenly\r\nplunging into a desperate resolve, he said, \"Are you a father?\"\r\n\r\nA shade passed over the stranger's face as he replied, \"I have been a\r\nfather. But why such a question?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if you have been a father,\" answered Etienne, \"you will sympathize\r\nwith me, when I tell you that to-day we christen our first-born child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, indeed!\" exclaimed the passenger, with a kind smile. \"Then these\r\npersons are--\"\r\n\r\n\"My guests,\" interrupted the landlord and postmaster, \"and you will know\r\nhow to excuse me if--\"\r\n\r\n\"If you wish us to the devil,\" returned the blue-eyed stranger, laughing\r\nmerrily. \"But, indeed, I cannot oblige you my excellent friend, for I\r\ndon't know where his infernal majesty is to be found; and if I may be\r\nallowed a preference, I would rather remain in the society of the two\r\npriests whom I see going into your house.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will not go farther, then--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, we ask to be allowed to join your guests, and attend the\r\nchristening. The baptism of a first-born child is a ceremony which\r\ntouches my heart, and yours, also, does it not?\" said the stranger to\r\nhis companion.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied the other, laughing, \"above all, when it is joined\r\nto another interesting ceremony--that of a good dinner. \"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you shall have a good dinner!\" cried Etienne, won over by the\r\nsympathy of the first speaker. \"Come in, gentlemen, come in. As the\r\nguests of our little son, you are welcome.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CVII.\r\n\r\nTHE GODFATHER.\r\n\r\n\"We accept with pleasure,\" said the strangers, and they followed the\r\nhost into the house. The door of the room where the guests were\r\nassembled was open, and the strangers, with a self-possession which\r\nproved them to be of the aristocracy, walked in and mingled at once in\r\nthe conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Allow me, gentlemen,\" said the host, when he had greeted the remainder\r\nof his guests, \"allow me to present you to Madame Etienne. She will he\r\nproud to receive two such distinguished strangers in her house to-day.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Etienne, with a woman's practised eye, saw at once that these\r\nunknown guests, who were so perfectly unembarrassed and yet so\r\ncourteous, must belong to the very first ranks of society; and she was\r\nhappy to be able to show off her savoir vivre before the rest of the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nShe received the two travellers with much grace and affability; and\r\nwhereas the curates were to have been placed beside her at table, she\r\nassigned them to her husband, and invited the strangers to the seats\r\ninstead. She informed them of the names and station of every person\r\npresent, and then related to them how the winter previous, at the ball\r\nof the sub-prefect, she had danced the whole evening, while some of the\r\nprettiest girls in the room had wanted partners.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen listened with obliging courtesy, and appeared deeply\r\ninterested. The blue-eyed stranger, however, mingled somewhat in the\r\ngeneral conversation. He spoke with the burgomaster from Solanges of the\r\ncondition of his town, with the curates of their congregations, and\r\nseemed interested in the prosperity of French manufactures, about which\r\nmuch was said at table.\r\n\r\nAll were enchanted with the tact and affability of the strangers.\r\nMonsieur Etienne was highly elated, and as for madame, her paleness had\r\nbeen superseded by a becoming flush, and she never once complained of\r\nover-exertion.\r\n\r\nThe dinner over, the company assembled for the baptism. It was to take\r\nplace in the parlor, where a table covered with a fine white cloth, a\r\nwax-candle, some flowers, a crucifix, and an improvised font, had been\r\narranged for the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe noble stranger gave his arm to Madame Etienne. \"Madame,\" said he,\r\n\"may I ask of you the favor of standing godfather to your son?\"\r\n\r\nMadame Etienne blushed with pleasure, and replied that she would be most\r\ngrateful for the honor.\r\n\r\n\"In this way,\" thought she, \"we shall find out his name and rank.\"\r\n\r\nThe ceremony began. The curate spoke a few impressive words as to the\r\nnature of the sacrament, and then proceeded to baptize the infant. The\r\nwater was poured over its head, and at last came the significant\r\nquestion: \"What is the name of the godfather?\" All eyes were turned upon\r\nhim, and Madame Etienne's heart beat hard, for she expected to hear the\r\nword \"count\" at the very least.\r\n\r\n\"My name?\" said he. \"Joseph.\"\r\n\r\n\"Joseph,\" repeated the priest. \"Joseph--and the surname?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought Joseph would be enough,\" said the stranger, with some\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" replied the priest. \"The surname, too, must be registered in\r\nthe baptismal records.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well then--Joseph the Second.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Second?\" echoed the curate, with a look of mistrust. \"The SECOND!\r\nIs that your surname?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my name is 'The Second.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, be it so,\" returned the curate, with a shrug. \"Joseph--\r\nthe--Second. Now, what is your profession--excuse me, sir, but I ask the\r\ncustomary questions.\"\r\n\r\nThe stranger looked down and seemed almost confused. The curate mildly\r\nrepeated his question. \"What is your profession, or your station, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Emperor of Austria,\" replied Joseph, smiling.\r\n\r\nA cry of astonishment followed this announcement. The pencil with which\r\nthe priest was about to record the \"profession\" of the godfather fell\r\nfrom his hands. Madame Etienne in her ecstasy fell almost fainting into\r\nan arm-chair, and Monsieur Etienne, taking the child from the arms of\r\nthe nurse, came and knelt with it at the emperor's feet.\r\n\r\nThis was the signal for a renewal of life and movement in the room. All\r\nfollowed the example of the host, and in one moment old and young, men\r\nand women, were on their knees.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty,\" said Etienne, in a voice choked with tears, \"you have\r\nmade my child famous. For a hundred years the honor you have conferred\r\nupon him will be the wonder of our neighborhood, and never will the\r\npeople of Vitry forget the condescension of your majesty in sitting\r\namong us as an equal and a guest. My son is a Frenchman at heart he\r\nshall also be a German, like our own beautiful queen, who is both\r\nAustrian and French. God bless and preserve you both! Long live our\r\nqueen, Marie Antoinette, and long live her noble brother, the Emperor of\r\nAustria!\"\r\n\r\nThe company echoed the cry, and their shouts aroused Madame Etienne, who\r\narose and advanced toward her imperial visitor. He hastened to replace\r\nher gently in her arm-chair.\r\n\r\n\"Where people are bound together by the ties of parent and god-father,\"\r\nsaid he, \"there must be no unnecessary ceremony. Will you do me one\r\nfavor, madame?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, my life is at your majesty's disposal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Preserve and treasure it, then, for the sake of my godson. And since\r\nyou are willing to do me the favor,\" continued he, drawing from his\r\nbosom a snuff-box richly set with diamonds, \"accept this as a\r\nremembrance of my pleasant visit to you to-day. My portrait is upon the\r\nlid, and as I am told that all the lovely women in France take snuff\r\nperhaps you will take your snuff from a box which I hope will remind you\r\nof the giver.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" continued the emperor, to the happy Monsieur Etienne, \"as I\r\nhave been admitted to the christening, perhaps you will accommodate me\r\nwith a pair of horses with which I may proceed to the next stage.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ARRIVAL AT VERSAILLES.\r\n\r\nThe French court was at Versailles, it having been decided by the king\r\nand queen that there they would receive the emperor's visit. A\r\nmagnificent suite of apartments had been fitted up for his occupation,\r\nand distinguished courtiers appointed as his attendants. He was\r\nanxiously expected; for already many an anecdote of his affability and\r\ngenerosity had reached Paris.\r\n\r\nA courier had arrived too say that the emperor had reached the last\r\nstation, and would shortly be in Versailles. The queen received this\r\nintelligence with tears of joy, and gathered all her ladies around her\r\nin the room where she expected to meet her brother. The king merely\r\nnodded, and a shade of dissatisfaction passed over his face. He turned\r\nto his confidential adviser, Count Maurepas, who was alone with him in\r\nhis cabinet.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me frankly, what do you think of this visit?\"\r\n\r\nThe old count raised his shoulders a la Francaise. \"Sire, the queen has\r\nso often invited the emperor, that I presume he has come to gratify her\r\nlongings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, bah!\" said Louis, impatiently. \"He is not so soft-hearted as to\r\nshape his actions to suit the longings of his family. Speak more\r\ncandidly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty commands me to be perfectly sincere?\"\r\n\r\n\"I entreat you, be truthful and tell me what you think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I confess that the emperor's visit has been a subject of much\r\nmystery to your majesty's ministers. You are right in saying that he is\r\nnot the man to trouble himself about the state of his relatives'\r\naffections. He comes to Paris for something nearer to his heart than any\r\nroyal sister. Perhaps his hope is that he may succeed in removing me,\r\nand procuring the appointment of De Choiseul in my stead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never! Austria cannot indulge such vain hopes, for her watchful spies\r\nmust ere this have convinced the Hapsburgs that my dislike toward this\r\nduke, so precious in the eyes of Maria Theresa, is unconquerable. My\r\nfather's shade banished him to Chanteloup, and I will follow this shade\r\nwhithersoever it leads. If my father had lived (and perchance Choiseul\r\nhad a hand in his death) there would have been no alliance of France\r\nwith Austria. I am forced to maintain it, since my wife is the daughter\r\nof Maria Theresa; so that neither the Austrian nor the anti-Austrian\r\nparty can ever hope to rule in France. Marie Antoinette is the wife of\r\nmy heart, and no human being shall ever dislodge her thence. But my love\r\nfor her can never influence my policy, which is steadfast to the\r\nprinciples of my father. If Joseph has come hither for political\r\npurposes, he might have spared his pains.\"\r\n\r\n\"He may have other views besides those we have alluded to. He may come\r\nto gain your majesty's sanction to his ambitious plans of territorial\r\naggrandizement. The emperor is inordinately ambitious, and is true to\r\nthe policy of his house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which, nevertheless, was obliged to yield Silesia,\" said Louis,\r\nderisively.\r\n\r\nThat is the open wound for which Austria seeks balsam from Turkey. If\r\nyour majesty does not stop him, the emperor will light the torch of war\r\nand kindle a conflagration that may embrace all Europe. \"\r\n\r\n\"If I can prevent war, it is my duty to do so; for peace is the sacred\r\nright of my people, and nothing but imperative necessity would drive me\r\nto invade that right.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the emperor is not of your majesty's mind. He hopes for war, in\r\nexpectation of winning glory.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I for peace, with the same expectation. I, too, would win\r\nglory--the glory of reigning over a happy and prosperous people. The\r\nfame of the conqueror is the scourge of mankind; that of the legislator,\r\nits blessing. The last shall be my portion--I have no object in view but\r\nthe welfare of the French nation.\"\r\n\r\n\"The emperor may endeavor to cajole your majesty through your very love\r\nfor France. He may propose to you an extension of French territory to\r\nreconcile you to his acquisitions in Turkey. He may suggest the\r\nNetherlands as an equivalent for Bosnia and Servia.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not accept the bribe,\" cried Louis hastily. \"France needs no\r\naggrandizement. If her boundaries were extended, she would lose in\r\nstrength what she gained in size; so that Joseph will waste his time if\r\nhe seeks to awaken in me a lust of dominion. I thirst for conquest, it\r\nis true--the conquest of my people's hearts. May my father's blessing,\r\nand my own sincere efforts enable me to accomplish the one purpose of my\r\nlife!\"\r\n\r\n\"You have accomplished it, sire,\" replied De Maurepas, with enthusiasm.\r\n\"You are the absolute master of your subjects' hearts and affections.\"\r\n\r\n\"If so, I desire to divide my domains with the queen.\" said Louis, with\r\na searching look at De Maurepas. The minister cast down his eyes. The\r\nking went on: \"You have something against her majesty--what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The queen has something against me, sire. I am an eyesore to her\r\nmajesty. She thinks I am in the way of De Choiseul, and will try every\r\nmeans to have me removed.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know that she would try in vain. I have already told you so. As a\r\nhusband, I forget that Marie Antoinette is an Archduchess of Austria,\r\nbut as my father's son--never! It is the same with her brother. I may\r\nfind him agreeable as a relative; but as Emperor of Austria, he will\r\nknow me as King of France alone. Be his virtues what they may, he never\r\ncan wring the smallest concession from me. But hark!--I hear the sound\r\nof wheels. You know my sentiments-communicate them to the other\r\nministers. I go to welcome my kinsman.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the king entered the queen's reception-room, she was standing in\r\nthe midst of her ladies. Her cheeks were pale, but her large, expressive\r\neyes were fixed with a loving gaze upon the door through which her\r\nbrother was to enter. When she saw the king, she started forward, and\r\nlaying both her hands in his, smiled affectionately.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sire,\" said she, \"the emperor has arrived, and my heart flutters\r\nso, that I can scarcely wait for him here. It seems to me so cold that\r\nwe do not go to meet him. Oh, come, dear husband, let us hasten to\r\nembrace our brother. Good Heaven! It is not forbidden a queen to have a\r\nheart, is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, it is a grace that well becomes her royalty,\" said\r\nLouis, with a smile. \"But your brother does not wish us to go forward to\r\nmeet him. That would be an acknowledgment of his imperial station, and\r\nyou know that he visits us as Count of Falkenstein.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, etiquette, forever etiquette!\" whispered the queen, while she\r\nopened her huge fan and began to fan herself. \"There is no escape from\r\nits fangs. We are rid of Madame de Noailles, but Madame Etiquette has\r\nstayed behind to watch our every look, to forbid us every joy--\"\r\n\r\nJust then the door opened, and a tall, manly form was seen upon the\r\nthreshold. His large blue eyes sought the queen, and recognizing her,\r\nhis face brightened with a bewitching smile. Marie Antoinette, heedless\r\nof etiquette, uttered a cry of joy and flew into his arms. \"Brother,\r\nbeloved brother!\" murmured she, in accents of heartfelt tenderness.\r\n\r\n\"My sister, my own dear Antoinette!\" was the loving reply, and Joseph\r\ndrew her head upon his breast and kissed her again and again. The queen,\r\novercome by joy, burst into tears, and in broken accents, welcomed the\r\nemperor to France.\r\n\r\nThe bystanders were deeply affected, all except the king--he alone was\r\nunmoved by the touching scene. He alone had remarked with displeasure\r\nthat Marie Antoinette had greeted her brother in their native tongue,\r\nand that Joseph had responded. It was a German emperor and a German\r\narchduchess who were locked in each other's arms--and near them stood\r\nthe King of France, for the moment forgotten. The position was\r\nembarrassing, and Louis had not tact enough to extricate himself\r\ngracefully. With ruffled brow and downcast eyes he stood, until, no\r\nlonger able to restrain his chagrin, he turned on his heel to leave the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a light hand was laid upon his arm, and the clear,\r\nsonorous voice of the queen was heard.\r\n\r\n\"My dear husband, whither are you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am here too soon,\" replied he, sharply. \"I had been told that the\r\nCount of Falkenstein had arrived, and I came to greet him. It appears\r\nthat it was a mistake, and I retire until he presents himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Count of Falkenstein is here, sire, and asks a thousand pardons for\r\nhaving allowed his foolish heart to get the better of his courtesy,\"\r\nsaid Joseph, with the superiority of better breeding. \"Forgive me for\r\ntaking such selfish possession of my sister's heart.. It was a momentary\r\nconcession from the Queen of France to the memories of her childhood;\r\nbut I lay it at your majesty's feet, and entreat you to accept it as\r\nyour well-won trophy.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at the king with such an expression of cordiality, that Louis\r\ncould not withstand him. A smile which he could not control, rippled the\r\ngloomy surface of the king's face; and he came forward, offering both\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\"I welcome you with my whole heart, my brother,\" said he in reply. \"Your\r\npresence in Versailles is a source of happiness both to the queen and to\r\nmyself. Let me accompany you to your apartments that you may take\r\npossession at once, and refresh yourself from the fatigues of\r\ntravelling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" replied Joseph, \"I will follow your majesty wheresoever you\r\nplease; but I cannot allow you to be inconvenienced by my visit. I and a\r\nsoldier, unaccustomed to magnificence, and not worthy of such royal\r\naccommodation as you offer.\"\r\n\r\n\"How!\" cried the queen.\" You will not be our guest?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will gladly be your guest at table if you allow it,\" replied the\r\nemperor, \"but I can dine with you without lodging at Versailles. When I\r\ntravel, I do not go to castles but to inns.\"\r\n\r\nThe king looked astounded. \"To inns?\" repeated he with emphasis.\r\n\r\n\"Count Falkenstein means hotels, your majesty,\" cried the queen,\r\nlaughing. \"My brother is not quite accustomed to our French terms, and\r\nwe will have to teach him the difference between a hotel and an inn. But\r\nto do this, dear brother, you must remain with us. Your apartments are\r\nas retired as you could possibly desire them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that Versailles is as vast as it is magnificent,\" said Joseph,\r\n\"but I have already sent my valet to take rooms for me in Paris. Let us,\r\nthen, say no more on the subject. [Footnote: \"Memoires de Madame de\r\nCampan,\" vol. i., p. 172.] I am very grateful to you for your\r\nhospitality, but I have come to France to hear, to see, and to learn. I\r\nmust be out early and late, and that would not suit the royal etiquette\r\nof Versailles.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you had come to Paris to visit the king and myself,\" said\r\nMarie Antoinette, looking disappointed.\r\n\r\n\"You were right, dear sister, but I am not so agreeable that you should\r\nwish to have me constantly at your side. I wish to become acquainted\r\nwith your beautiful Paris. It is so full of treasures of art and wonders\r\nof industry, that a man has only to use his eyes, and he grows\r\naccomplished. I am much in need of such advantages, sire, for you will\r\nfind me a barbarian for whose lapses you will have to be indulgent.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must crave then a reciprocity of indulgence,\" replied Louis. \"But,\r\ncome, count--give your arm to the queen, and let her show you the way to\r\ndinner. To-day we dine en famille, and my brothers and sisters are\r\nimpatient to welcome Count Falkenstein to Versailles.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CIX.\r\n\r\nCOUNT FALKENSTEIN IN PARIS.\r\n\r\nA modest hackney-coach stood before the door of the little Hotel de\r\nTurenne, in the Rue Vivienne. The occupant, who had just alighted, was\r\nabout to enter the hotel, when the hunt, who was standing before the\r\ndoor, with his hands plunged to the very bottom of his breeches pockets,\r\nstopped the way, and, not very politely, inquired what he wanted.\r\n\r\n\"I want what everybody else wants here, and what your sign offers to\r\neverybody--lodgings, \"replied the stranger.\r\n\r\n\"That is precisely what you cannot have,\" said mine host, pompously. \"I\r\nam not at liberty to receive any one, not even a gentleman of your\r\ndistinguished appearance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, take in your sign, my friend. When a man inveigles travellers\r\nwith a sign, he ought to be ready to satisfy their claims upon his\r\nhospitality. I, therefore, demand a room.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you, sir, that you cannot have it. The Hotel de Turenne has been\r\ntoo highly honored to entertain ordinary guests. The Emperor of Austria,\r\nbrother of the beautiful queen, has taken lodgings here.\"\r\n\r\nThe stranger laughed. \"If the emperor were to hear you, he would take\r\nlodgings with someone more discreet than yourself. He travels incognito\r\nin France.\"\r\n\r\n\"But everybody is in the secret, sir; and all Paris is longing for a\r\nsight of Count Falkenstein, of whom all sorts of delightful anecdotes\r\nare circulated. He is affability itself, and speaks with men generally\r\nas if they were his equals.\"\r\n\r\n\"And pray,\" said the stranger, laughing, \"is he made differently from\r\nother men?\"\r\n\r\nThe host eyed his interrogator with anger and contempt. \"This is very\r\npresuming language,\" said he, \"and as his majesty is my guest, I cannot\r\nsuffer it. The French think the world of him, and no wonder, for he is\r\nthe most condescending sovereign in Europe. He refused to remain at the\r\npalace, and comes to take up his abode here. Is not that magnanimous?\"\r\n\r\n\"I find it merely a matter of convenience. He wishes to be in a central\r\nsituation. Has he arrived?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not yet. His valet is here, and has set up his camp-bed. I am\r\nwaiting to receive the emperor and his suite now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the valet Guther here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you know this gentleman's name! Then perhaps you belong to the\r\nemperor's suite?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the stranger, laughing, \"I shave him occasionally. Now call\r\nGunther.\"\r\n\r\nThere was something rather imperious in the tone of the gentleman who\r\noccasionally shaved the emperor, and the landlord felt impelled to obey.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said he, respectfully, \"if you shave the emperor, you are\r\nentitled to a room here.\"\r\n\r\nThe stranger followed him up the broad staircase that led to the first\r\nstory of the hotel. As they reached the landing, a door opened, and the\r\nemperor's valet stepped out into the ball.\r\n\r\n\"His majesty!\" exclaimed he, quickly moving aside and standing stiff as\r\na sentry by the door.\r\n\r\n\"His majesty!\" echoed the landlord. \"This gentleman--this--Your\r\nmajesty--have I--\"\r\n\r\n\"I am Count Falkenstein,\" replied the emperor, amused. \"You see now that\r\nyou were wrong to refuse me; for the man whom you took for an ordinary\r\nmortal was neither more nor less than the emperor himself.\"\r\n\r\nThe landlord bent the knee and began to apologize, but Joseph stopped\r\nhim short. \"Never mind,\" said he, \"follow me, I wish to speak with you.\"\r\n\r\nThe valet opened the door, and the emperor entered the room, the\r\nfrightened landlord following.\r\n\r\n\"These are my apartments!\" continued Joseph, looking around.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"I retain four of them--an anteroom, a sitting-room, a bedroom, and a\r\nroom for my valet. I will keep them for six weeks, on one condition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty has only to command here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, I command you to forget what I am in Austria. In France, I\r\nam Count Falkenstein; and if ever I hear myself spoken of by any other\r\nname, I leave your house on the spot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will obey your instructions, count.\"\r\n\r\n\"You understand, then, that I desire to be received and regarded as an\r\nordinary traveller. Whence it follows that you will take in whatever\r\nother guests apply to you for lodging. You have proved to me to-day how\r\nunpleasant it is to be turned away, and I desire to spare other\r\napplicants the--same inconvenience.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose the Parisians should wish to see Count Falkenstein?\"\r\n\r\n\"They will have to submit to a disappointment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Should any one seek an audience of--the count?\"\r\n\r\n\"The count receives visitors, but gives audience to no one. His visitors\r\nwill be announced by his valet. Therefore you need give yourself no\r\ntrouble on that head. Should any unfortunate or needy persons present\r\nthemselves, you are at liberty to admit them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" cried the host, with tears in his eyes, \"how the Parisians will\r\nappreciate such generosity!\"\r\n\r\n\"They will not have the opportunity of doing so, for they shall not hear\r\na word of it. Now go and send me a barber; and take all the custom that\r\npresents itself to you, whether it comes in a chariot or a\r\nHackney-coach.\"\r\n\r\nThe host retired, and as the door was closing, Count Rosenberg appeared.\r\nThe emperor took his hand, and bade him welcome.\r\n\r\n\"I Have just been to the embassy,\" said Rosenberg, \"and Count von Mercy\r\nsays--\"\r\n\r\n\"That I told him I would take rooms at the Hotel of the Ambassadors, but\r\nI also reserve to myself this nice little bachelor establishment, to\r\nwhich I may retreat when I feel inclined to do so. The advantage of\r\nthese double quarters is, that nobody will know exactly where to find\r\nme, and I shall enjoy some freedom from parade. At the Hotel of the\r\nAmbassadors I shall be continually bored with imperial honors. Here, on\r\nthe contrary, I am free as air, and can study Paris at my leisure.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you intend to pursue these studies alone, count? Is no one to\r\naccompany you to spare you inconvenience, perchance to assist you in\r\npossible peril?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my friend, as to peril, you know, that I am not easily frightened,\r\nand that the Paris police is too well organized to lose sight of me.\r\nMonsieur de Sartines, doubtless, thinks that I need as much watching as\r\na house-breaker, for it is presumed at court that I have come to steal\r\nthe whole country, and carry it to Austria in my pocket.\"\r\n\r\n\"They know that to Count Falkenstein nothing is impossible.\" replied\r\nRosenberg. \"To carry away France would not be a very hard matter to a\r\nman who has robbed the French people of their hearts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, bah! the French people have no hearts. They have nothing but\r\nimagination. There is but one man in France who has genuine\r\nsensibility--and that one is their poor, timid young king. Louis has a\r\nheart, but that heart I shall never win. Heaven grant that the queen\r\nhave power to make it hers!\"\r\n\r\n\"The queen? If Louis has a heart, it surely cannot be insensible to the\r\ncharms of that lovely young queen!\"\r\n\r\n\"It ought not to be, for she deserves the love of the best of men. But\r\nthings are not as they should be here. I have learned that in the few\r\nhours of my visit to Versailles. The queen has bitter enemies, and you\r\nand I, Rosenberg, must try to disarm them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can I do, count, in this matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can watch and report to me. Swear to me, as an honest man, that you\r\nwill conceal nothing you hear to the queen's detriment or to mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I swear it, count.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, my friend. Let us suppose that our mission is to free my\r\nsister from the power of a dragon, and restore her to her lover. You are\r\nmy trusty squire, and together we shall prevail over the monster, and\r\ndeliver the princess.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment a knocking was heard at the door. It was opened, and an\r\nelegant cavalier, with hat and sword, entered the room, with a sweeping\r\nbow. The emperor stepped politely forward, and inquired his business.\r\n\r\nThe magnificent cavalier waved his hat, and with an air of proud\r\nconsciousness, replied:\r\n\r\n\"I was requested to give my advice regarding the arrangement of a\r\ngentleman's hair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, the barber,\" said the emperor. \"Then be so good, sir, as to give\r\nyour advice, and dress my hair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, sir, that is not my profession,\" replied the cavalier,\r\nhaughtily. \"I am a physiognomist. Allow me to call in my subordinate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said the emperor, ready to burst with laughter, as he\r\nsurveyed the solemn demeanor of the artiste. The latter walked\r\nmajestically to the door, and opened it.\r\n\r\n\"Jean!\" cried he, with the voice of a field-marshal; and a youth\r\nfluttered in, laden with powder-purses, combs, curling-tongs, ribbons,\r\npomatum, and the other appurtenances of a first-rate hair-dresser.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir,\" said the physiognomist, gravely, \"be so good as to take a\r\nseat.\" Joseph obeyed the polite command, upon which the physiognomist\r\nretired several paces, folded his arms, and contemplated the emperor in\r\nsolemn silence.\r\n\r\n\"Be so kind as to turn your head to the left--a little more--so--that\r\nis it--I wish to see your profile,\" said he after a while.\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir, pray inform me whether in France it is customary to take a\r\nman's portrait before you dress his hair?\" asked the emperor, scarcely\r\nable to restrain his increasing mirth; while Rosenberg retired to the\r\nwindow, where Joseph could see him shaking, with his handkerchief before\r\nhis mouth.\r\n\r\n\"It is not customary, sir,\" replied the physiognomist, with grave\r\nearnestness. \"I study your face that I may decide which style becomes\r\nyou best.\"\r\n\r\nBehind the chair stood the hair-dresser in a fashionable suit of\r\nnankeen, with lace cuffs and ruffles, hovering like a large yellow\r\nbutterfly over the emperor, and ready at the signal to alight upon the\r\nimperial head with brush and comb.\r\n\r\nThe physiognomist continued his study. He contemplated the head of the\r\nemperor from every point of view, walking slowly around him, and\r\nreturning to take a last survey of the front. Finally his eye rested\r\nmajestically upon the butterfly, which fluttered with expectation.\r\n\r\n\"Physiognomy of a free negro,\" said he, with pathos. \"Give the gentleman\r\nthe Moorish coiffure.\" [Footnote: \"Memoires d'un Voyageur qui se\r\nRepose,\" vol. iii., p. 42.] And with a courtly salute he left the room.\r\n\r\nThe emperor now burst into shouts of laughter, in which he was heartily\r\njoined by Rosenberg.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the butterfly had set to work, and was frizzing with all his\r\nmight.\r\n\r\n\"How will you manage to give me the Moorish coiffure?\" asked the\r\nemperor, when he had recovered his speech.\r\n\r\n\"I shall divide your hair into a multitude of single locks; curl, friz\r\nthem, and they will stand out from your head in exact imitation of the\r\nnegro's wool,\" answered the butterfly, triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt that it would accord charmingly with my physiognomy,\"\r\nsaid the emperor, once more indulging in a peal of laughter, \"but to-day\r\nI must content myself with the usual European style. Dress my hair as\r\nyou see it, and be diligent, for I am pressed for time.\"\r\n\r\nThe hair-dresser reluctantly obeyed, and in a few minutes the work was\r\ncompleted and the artiste had gone.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Joseph to Count Rosenberg, \"I am about to pay some visits.\r\nMy first one shall be to Monsieur de Maurepas. He is one of our most\r\nactive opponents, and I long to become acquainted with my enemies. Come,\r\nthen, let us go to the hotel of the keeper of the great seal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty's carriages are not here,\" replied Rosenberg.\r\n\r\n\"Dear friend, my equipages are always in readiness. Look on the opposite\r\nside of the street at those hackney-coaches. They are my carriages for\r\nthe present. Now let us cross over and select one of the neatest.\"\r\n\r\nPerfect silence reigned in the anteroom of Monsieur de Maurepas. A\r\nliveried servant, with important mien, walked forth and back before the\r\nclosed door of the reception-room, like a bull-dog guarding his master's\r\nsacred premises. The door of the first anteroom was heard to open, and\r\nthe servant turned an angry look toward two gentlemen who made their\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said he, \"the two gentlemen who just now alighted from the\r\nhackney-coach?\"\r\n\r\n\"The same,\" said the emperor. \"Is monsieur le comte at home?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is,\" said the servant pompously.\r\n\r\n\"Then be so good as to announce to him Count Falkenstein.\"\r\n\r\nThe man shrugged his shoulders. \"I am sorry that I cannot oblige you,\r\nsir. Monsieur de Taboreau is with the count; and until their conference\r\nis at an end, I can announce nobody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then, I shall wait,\" replied Joseph, taking a seat, and\r\npointing out another to Count Rosenberg.\r\n\r\nThe servant resumed his walk, and the two visitors in silence awaited\r\nthe end of the conference.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, Rosenberg,\" said Joseph, after a pause, \"that I am\r\ngrateful to Count de Maurepas for this detention in his ante-room? It is\r\nsaid that experience is the mother of wisdom. Now my experience of\r\nto-day teaches me that it is excessively tiresome to wait in an\r\nanteroom. I think I shall be careful for the future, when I have\r\npromised to receive a man, not to make him wait. Ah! here comes another\r\nvisitor. We are about to have companions in ennui.\"\r\n\r\nThe person who entered the room was received with more courtesy than\r\n\"the gentlemen who had come in the hackney-coach.\" The servant came\r\nforward with eagerness, and humbly craved his pardon while informing him\r\nthat his excellency was not yet visible.\r\n\r\n\"I shall wait,\" replied the Prince de Harrai, advancing to a seat.\r\nSuddenly he stopped, and looked in astonishment at Count Falkenstein,\r\nwho, perfectly unconcerned, was sitting in a corner of the room.\r\n\r\n\"Great Heaven! his majesty, the emperor!\" cried he, shocked, but\r\nrecovering himself sufficiently to make a deep inclination.\r\n\r\n\"Can your majesty pardon this unheard of oversight!\"\r\n\r\n\"Peace, prince,\" replied the emperor, smiling; \"you will disturb the\r\nministers at their conference.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, man, how is it that his excellency is not apprised of his\r\nmajesty's presence here?\" said the Prince de Harrai to the lackey.\r\n\r\n\"His excellency never spoke to me of an emperor,\" stammered the\r\nterrified lackey. \"He desired me to admit no one except a foreign count,\r\nwhose name, your highness, I have been so unlucky as to forget.\"\r\n\r\n\"Except Count Falkenstein.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your highness, I believe--that is, I think it--\"\r\n\r\n\"And you leave the count to wait here in the anteroom!\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg monsieur le comte a thousand pardons. I will at once repair my\r\nerror.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay,\" said the emperor, imperatively. Then turning to the Prince de\r\nHarrai, he continued good-humoredly: \"If your highness is made to wait\r\nin the anteroom, there is no reason why the Count of Falkenstein should\r\nnot bear you company. Let us, then, wait together.\"\r\n\r\nThe ministerial conference lasted half an hour longer, but at last the\r\ndoor opened, and Monsieur de Maurepas appeared. He was coming forward\r\nwith ineffable courtesy to receive his guests, when perceiving the\r\nemperor, his self-possession forsook him at once. Pale, hurried, and\r\nconfused, he stammered a few inaudible words of apology, when Joseph\r\ninterrupted and relieved him.\r\n\r\nHe offered his hand with a smile, saying: \"Do not apologize; it is\r\nunnecessary. It is nothing but right that business of state should have\r\nprecedence over private visitors.\" [Footnote: The emperor's own words.\r\nHubner. \"Life of Joseph H.,\" p. 141.]\r\n\r\n\"But your majesty is no private individual!\" cried the minister, with\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me,\" said the emperor, gravely. \"As long as I remain here. I am\r\nnothing more. I left the Emperor of Austria at Vienna: he has no concern\r\nwith the Count of Falkenstein, who is on a visit to Paris, and who has\r\ncome hither, not to parade his rank, but to see and to learn where there\r\nis so much to be learned. May I hope that you will aid Count Falkenstein\r\nin his search after knowledge?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CX.\r\n\r\nTHE QUEEN AND THE \"DAMES DE LA HALLE.\"\r\n\r\nA brilliant crowd thronged the apartments of the Princess d'Artois. The\r\nroyal family, the court, and the lords and ladies of high rank were\r\nassembled in her reception-rooms, for close by an event of highest\r\nimportance to France was about to transpire. The princess was giving\r\nbirth to a scion of royalty. The longings of France were about to be\r\nfulfilled--the House of Bourbon was to have an heir to its greatness.\r\n\r\nThe accouchement of a royal princess was in those days an event that\r\nconcerned all Paris, and all the authorities and corporations of the\r\ngreat capital had representatives in those reception-rooms. It being\r\nonly a princess who was in labor, and not a queen, none but the royal\r\nfamily and the ministers were admitted into her bedchamber. The\r\naristocracy waited in the reception-rooms, the people in the corridors\r\nand galleries. Had it been Marie Antoinette, all the doors would have\r\nbeen thrown open to her subjects. The fishwives of Paris, the laborers,\r\nthe gamins, even the beggars had as much right to see the Queen of\r\nFrance delivered, as the highest dignitary of the land. The people,\r\nthen, who thronged both palace and gardens, were awaiting the moment\r\nwhen the physician should appear upon the balcony and announce to the\r\nenraptured populace that a prince or princess had been vouchsafed to\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time one of the royal physicians came out to report the\r\nprogress of affairs, until finally the voice of the accoucheur\r\nproclaimed that the Princess d'Artois had given birth to a prince.\r\n\r\nA cry of joy followed this announcement. It was that of the young\r\nmother. Raising her head from her pillow, she cried out in ecstasy, \"Oh,\r\nhow happy, how happy I am!\" [Foreword: Madame de Campan, vol. i., p 216.\r\nThe prince whose advent was a source of such triumph to his mother, was\r\nthe Duke de Berry, father of the present Count de Chambord. He it was\r\nwho, in 1827, was stabbed as he was about to enter the theatre, and died\r\nin the arms of Louis XVIII., former Count de Provence.]\r\n\r\nThe queen bent over her and kissed her forehead, whispering words of\r\naffectionate sympathy in her ear; but no one saw the tears that fell\r\nfrom Marie Antoinette's eyes upon the lace-covered pillow of her\r\nfortunate kinswoman.\r\n\r\nShe kissed the princess again, as though to atone for those tears, and\r\nwith tender congratulations took her leave. She passed through the\r\nreception-rooms, greeting the company with smiling composure, and then\r\nwent out into the corridors which led to her own apartments. Here the\r\nscene changed. Instead of the respectful silence which had saluted her\r\npassage through the rooms, she encountered a hum of voices and an eager\r\nmultitude all pressing forward to do her homage after their own rough\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nEvery one felt bound to speak a word of love or of admiration, and it\r\nwas only by dint of great exertion that the two footmen who preceded the\r\nqueen were able to open a small space through which she could pass. She\r\nfelt annoyed--even alarmed--and for the first time in her life regretted\r\nthe etiquette which once had required that the Queen of France should\r\nnot traverse the galleries of Versailles without an escort of her ladies\r\nof honor.\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette had chosen to dispense with their attendance, and now\r\nshe was obliged to endure the contact of those terrible \"dames de la\r\nhalle,\" who for hundreds of years had claimed the privilege of speaking\r\nface to face with royalty, and who now pressed around her, with jokes\r\nthat crimsoned her cheeks while they were rapturously received by the\r\ncanaille.\r\n\r\nWith downcast eyes and trembling steps, she tried to hurry past the\r\nodious crowd of poissardes.\r\n\r\n\"Look, look,\" cried one, peering in her face, \"look at the queen and see\r\nher blushing like a rose-bud!\"\r\n\r\n\"But indeed, pretty queen, you should remember that you are not a\r\nrose-bud, but a full-blown rose, and it is time that you were putting\r\nforth rose-buds yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it is, so it is,\" shouted the multitude. \"The queen owes us a\r\nrose-bud, and we must have it.\" \"See here, pretty queen,\" cried another\r\nfish-wife, \"it is your fault if we stand here on the staircases and out\r\nin the hot sun to-day. If you had done your duty to France instead of\r\nleaving it to the princess in yonder, the lackeys would have been\r\nobliged to open the doors to us as well as to the great folks, and we\r\nwould have jostled the dukes and princes, and taken our ease on your\r\nvelvet sofas. The next time we come here, we must have a tramp into the\r\nqueen's room, and she must let us see herself and a brave dauphin, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" cried the fish-wives in chorus, \"when we come back we must\r\nsee the young dauphin.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen tried to look as though she heard none of this. Not once had\r\nshe raised her eyes or turned her head. Now she was coming to the end of\r\nher painful walk through the corridors, for Heaven be praised! just\r\nbefore her was the door of her own anteroom. Once across that threshold\r\nshe was safe from the coarse ribaldry that was making her heart throb\r\nand her cheeks tingle; for there the rights of the people ended, and\r\nthose of the sovereign began.\r\n\r\nBut the \"dames de la halle\" were perfectly aware of this, and they were\r\ndetermined that she should not escape so easily.\r\n\r\n\"Promise us,\" cried a loud, shrill voice, \"promise us that we shall have\r\na young dauphin as handsome as his mother and as good as his father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, promise, promise,\" clamored the odious throng; and men and women\r\npressed close upon the queen to see her face and hear her answer.\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette had almost reached her door. She gave a sigh of relief,\r\nand for the first time raised her eyes with a sad, reproachful look\r\ntoward her tormentors.\r\n\r\nJust then a strapping, wide-shouldered huckster, pushed her heavy body\r\nbetween the queen and the door, and barring the entrance with her great\r\nbrown arms, cried out vociferously: \"You to not pass until you promise!\r\nWe love you and love the king we will none of the Count de Provence for\r\nour king; we must have a dauphin.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen still pretended not to hear. She tried to evade the poissarde\r\nand to slip into her room; but the woman perceived the motion, and\r\nconfronted her again.\r\n\r\n\"Be so kind, madame,\" said Marie Antoinette, mildly, \"as to allow me to\r\npass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give us the promise, then,\" said the fish-wife, putting her arms\r\na-kimbo.\r\n\r\nThe other women echoed the words, \"Give us the promise, give us the\r\npromise!\"\r\n\r\nPoor Marie Antoinette! She felt her courage leaving her--she must be rid\r\nof this fearful band of viragos at any price. She would faint if she\r\nstood there much longer.\r\n\r\nAgain the loud cry. \"Promise us a dauphin, a dauphin, a dauphin!\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise,\" at last replied the queen. \"Now, madame, in mercy, let me\r\nhave entrance to my own rooms.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman stepped back, the queen passed away, and behind her the people\r\nshouted out in every conceivable tone of voice, \"She has promised. The\r\nqueen has promised a dauphin!\"\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette walked hurriedly forward through the first anteroom\r\nwhere her footman waited, to the second wherein her ladies of honor were\r\nassembled.\r\n\r\nWithout a word to any of them she darted across the room and opening the\r\ndoor of her cabinet, threw herself into an arm-chair and sobbed aloud.\r\nNo one was there excepting Madame de Campan.\r\n\r\n\"Campan,\" said she, while tears were streaming down her cheeks, \"shut\r\nthe door, close the portiere. Let no one witness the sorrow of the Queen\r\nof France.\"\r\n\r\nWith a passionate gesture, she buried her face in her hands and wept\r\naloud.\r\n\r\nAfter a while she raised her tearful eyes and they rested upon Madame de\r\nCampan, who was kneeling before her with an expression of sincerest\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Campan, what humiliation I have endured today! The poorest woman on\r\nthe street is more fortunate than I; and if she bears a child upon her\r\narm, she can look down with compassion upon the lonely Queen of\r\nFrance,--that queen upon whose marriage the blessing of God does not\r\nrest; for she has neither husband nor child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say not so, your majesty, for God has smitten your enemies, and with\r\nHis own tender hand He is kindling the fire of love in the heart of the\r\nking your husband.\"\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette shook her head sadly. \"No--the king does not love me.\r\nHis heart does not respond to mine. He loves me, perhaps, as a sister,\r\nbut no more--no more!\"\r\n\r\n\"He loves your majesty with the passion and enthusiasm of a lover, but\r\nhe is very timid, and waits for some token of reciprocity before he\r\ndares to avow his love.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he does not love me,\" repeated Marie Antoinette with a sigh. \"I\r\nhave tried every means to win his heart. He is indulgent toward my\r\nfailings, and kindly anticipates my wishes; sometimes he seems to enjoy\r\nmy society, but it is with the calm, collateral affection of a brother\r\nfor his sister. And I!--oh, my God! my whole heart is his, and craves\r\nfor that ardent, joy-bestowing love of which poets sing, and which noble\r\nwomen prize above every earthly blessing. Such love as my father gave to\r\nmy happy mother, I would that the king felt for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"The king does not know the extent of his love for your majesty,\" said\r\nDe Campan soothingly. \"Some fortunate accident or dream of jealousy will\r\nreveal it to him before long.\"\r\n\r\n\"God speed the accident or the dream!\" sighed the queen; and forthwith\r\nher tears began to flow anew, while her hands lay idly upon her lap.\r\n\r\nThose burning tears at last awakened her from the apathy of grief.\r\nSuddenly she gave a start and threw back her head. Then she rose from\r\nher seat, and, like Maria Theresa, began to pace the apartment.\r\nGradually her face resumed its usual expression, and her demeanor\r\nbecame, as it was wont to be, dignified and graceful. Coming directly up\r\nto Madame de Campan, she smiled and gave her hand. \"Good Campan,\" said\r\nshe, \"you have seen me in a moment of weakness, of which I am truly\r\nashamed. Try to forget it dear friend, and I promise that it shall never\r\nbe repeated. And now, call my tire-women and order my carriage. Leonard\r\nis coming with a new coiffure, and Bertin has left me several beautiful\r\nhats. Let us choose the very prettiest of them all, for I must go and\r\nshow myself to the people. Order an open carriage, that every one may\r\nsee my face, and no one may say that the queen envies the maternal joys\r\nof the Countess d'Artois. Tonight we are to have the opera of\r\n'Iphigenia'--it is one of my magnificent teacher's chefs-d'oeuvre. The\r\nemperor and I are to go together to listen to our divine Gluck's music,\r\nand Paris must believe that Marie Antoinette is happy--too happy to envy\r\nany woman! Come, Campan, and dress me becomingly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXI.\r\n\r\nTHE ADOPTED SON OF THE QUEEN.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, the queen entered her carriage in all the splendor of\r\nfull dress. Leonard had altered her coiffure. Instead of the three-story\r\ntower, her hair was low, and she wore a most becoming hat, chiefly made\r\nup of flowers and feathers. She also wore rouge, for she was very pale;\r\nand to conceal the traces of weeping she had drawn a faint dark line\r\nbelow her lower lashes which greatly increased the brilliancy of her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nShe ordered her coachman to drive through the town. Wherever the royal\r\noutriders announced her coming, the people gathered on: either side of\r\nthe streets to wave their hats and handkerchiefs, and greet her with\r\nevery demonstration of enthusiasm and love.\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette greatly enjoyed her popularity, she bowed her head, and\r\nsmiled, and waved her hand in return, calling upon the ladies who\r\naccompanied her to sympathize with her happiness.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" said she to the Princess de Lamballe, [Footnote: The Princess\r\nde Lamballe was subsequently beheaded, and her head was carried through\r\nthe streets of Paris on a pike.--Trans.] \"the people love me, I do\r\nbelieve. They seem glad to see me, and I, too, like to see them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty sees that in Versailles, as in Paris, you have thousands\r\nof lovers,\" replied the princess.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said the queen, \"my lovers are there to be seen; but my enemies,\r\nwho lie concealed, are more active than my friends. And how do I know\r\nthat they are not now among the crowd that welcomes me! How dreadful it\r\nis to wear a mask through life! They, perhaps, who shout `Long live the\r\nqueen,' are plotting against her peace, and I, who smile in return, dare\r\nnot trust them!\"\r\n\r\nThe royal equipage had now reached the gates, and was passing into the\r\ncountry. Marie Antoinette felt a sense of relief at the change. She\r\ngazed with rapture upon the rich foliage of the trees, and then looking\r\npensively above for a few moments, she watched the floating clouds of\r\nblue and silver, and then followed the flight of the birds that were\r\nsoaring in such freedom through the air.\r\n\r\n\"How I wish that I could fly!\" said she, sighing. \"We mortals are less\r\nprivileged than the little birds--we must creep along the earth with the\r\nreptiles that we loath! Faster, tell the coachman to drive faster!\"\r\ncried she, eagerly, \"I would like to move rapidly just now. Faster,\r\nstill faster!\"\r\n\r\nThe command went forward, and the outriders dashed ahead at full speed.\r\nThe carriage whirled past the cottages on the wayside, while the queen,\r\nleaning back upon her satin cushions, gave herself up to the dreamy\r\nenjoyment which steals over the senses during a rapid drive.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was an exclamation, and the horses were reined in. The\r\nqueen started from her reverie, and leaned forward.\r\n\r\n\"What has happened?\" cried she of the equerry, who at that moment sprang\r\nto the side of the caleche.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty, a child has just run across the road, and has been\r\nsnatched from under the horses' feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"A child!\" exclaimed the queen, starting from her seat. \"Is it killed?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty. It is luckily unhurt. The coachman reined up his\r\nhorses in time for one of the outriders to save it. It is\r\nunhurt--nothing but frightened. Your majesty can see him now in the arms\r\nof the old peasant-woman there.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is about to return to the cottage with it,\" said the queen. Then\r\nstretching her arms toward the old woman, she cried out in an imploring\r\nvoice: \"Give me the child--bring it here! Heaven has sent it to me as a\r\ncomfort! Give it to me, I entreat you.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the old woman, recalled by the equerry, was approaching the\r\ncarriage. \"See,\" exclaimed the queen to her ladies, \"see what a lovely\r\nboy!\" And, indeed, he was a beautiful child, in spite of his little\r\ntattered red jacket, and his bare brown legs, of dark with dirt as with\r\nsunburn.\r\n\r\n\"Where is his mother?\" asked Marie Antoinette, looking compassionately\r\nat the child.\r\n\r\n\"My daughter is dead, madame,\" said the peasant. \"She died last winter,\r\nand left me the burden of five young children to feed.\"\r\n\r\n\"They shall burden you no longer,\" exclaimed the queen kindly. \"I will\r\nmaintain them all, and this little angel you must give to me. Will you\r\nnot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, madame, the child is only too lucky! But my little Jacob is so\r\nwilful that he will not stay with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will teach him to love me,\" returned the queen. \"Give him to me now.\"\r\n\r\nShe leaned forward and received the child from his grandmother's arms.\r\nIt was so astounded, that it uttered not a cry; it only opened its great\r\nblue eyes to their utmost, while the queen settled it upon her lap.\r\n\r\n\"See,\" exclaimed the delighted Marie Antoinette, \"he is not at all\r\nafraid of me. Oh, we are going to be excellent friends! Adieu, my poor\r\nold grandmother. I will send you something for your children as soon as\r\nI reach home. And now, Monsieur de Vievigne, let us return to\r\nVersailles. Tell your grandmamma good-by, little Jacob. You are going to\r\nride with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Adieu, my little one,\" said the grandmother. \"Don't forget your--\"\r\n\r\nHer words were drowned in the whirr of the carriage, which disappeared\r\nfrom her wondering eyes in a cloud of dust.\r\n\r\nThe motion, the noise, and the air brushing his curls into his face,\r\nawakened the boy from his stupor. He started from the queen's arms, and\r\nlooking wildly around, began to yell with all his might. Never had such\r\nunharmonious sounds assailed the ears of the queen before. But she\r\nseemed to be quite amused with it. The louder little Jacob screamed and\r\nkicked, the closer she pressed him to her heart; nor did she seem to\r\nobserve that his dirty little feet were leaving unsightly marks upon her\r\nrich silk dress.\r\n\r\nThe caleche arrived at Versailles, and drew up before the doors of the\r\npalace. With her newly acquired treasure in her arms, the queen\r\nattempted to leave the carriage, but the shrieks and kicks became so\r\nvigorous, that she was obliged to put the child down. The pages,\r\ngentlemen, and ladies in waiting, stared in astonishment as her majesty\r\nwent by, holding the refractory little peasant by the hand, his rosy\r\ncheeks covered with many an arabesque, the joint production of tears and\r\ndirt. Little cared Jacob for the splendor around him; still less for the\r\ncaresses of his royal protectress.\r\n\r\n\"I want to go to my grandmother,\" shrieked he, \"I want my brother Louis\r\nand sister Marianne!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear little one!\" cried the queen, \"what an affectionate heart he\r\nhas! He loves his relatives better than all our luxury, and the Queen of\r\nFrance is less to him than his poor old grandmother!--Never mind,\r\ndarling, you shall be loved as well and better than you ever were at\r\nhome, and all the more that you have not learned to flatter!\"\r\n\r\nShe bent down to caress him, but he wiped off her kisses with\r\nindignation. Marie Antoinette laughed heartily, and led the child into\r\nher cabinet, where she placed him on the very spot where she had been\r\nweeping a few hours earlier.\r\n\r\n\"Campan,\" said she, \"see how good God has been to me to-day! He has sent\r\nme a child upon whom I can lavish all the love which is consuming my\r\npoor, lonely heart. Yes, my little one, I will be a mother to you, and\r\nmay God and your own mother hear my vow! Now, Campan, let us take\r\ncounsel together as to what is to be done. First, we must have a nurse,\r\nand then his face must be washed, and he must be dressed as becomes my\r\npretty little adopted son.\"\r\n\r\nThe child, who had ceased his cries for a moment, now broke out into\r\nfresh shrieks. \"I want to go home! I won't stay here in this big house!\r\nTake me to my grandmother!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, you unconscionable little savage!\" said Madame de Campan.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Campan!\" cried, the queen deprecatingly, \"how can you chide the\r\nlittle fellow! His cries are so many proofs of the honesty of his heart,\r\nwhich is not to be bribed of its love by all that royalty can bestow!\"\r\n[Footnote: The queen kept her word. The boy was brought up as her own\r\nchild. He always breakfasted and dined by her side, and she never called\r\nhim by any other name save that of \"my child.\" When Jacques grew up, he\r\ndisplayed a taste for painting, and of course had every advantage which\r\nroyal protection could afford him. He was privileged to approach the\r\nqueen unannounced. But when the Revolution broke out, this miserable\r\nwretch, to avoid popularity, joined the Jacobins, and was one of the\r\nqueen's bitterest enemies and most frenzied accusers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXII.\r\n\r\n\"CHANTONS, CELEBRONS NOTRE REINE.\"\r\n\r\nThe opera-house was full to overflowing. In the lowest tier were the\r\nladies of the aristocracy, their heads surmounted by those abominable\r\ntowers of Leonard's invention. Above them sat the less distinguished\r\nspectators; and the parquet was thronged by poets, learned men,\r\nstudents, and civil officers of various grades. Almost every class found\r\nsome representatives in that brilliant assemblage; and each one felt\r\nkeenly the privilege he enjoyed in being present on that particular\r\noccasion. But it was not altogether for the sake of the music that all\r\nParis had flocked to the opera. The Parisians were less desirous to hear\r\n\"Iphigenia,\" than to see the emperor, who was to be there in company\r\nwith his sister.\r\n\r\nSince his arrival in the capital, Joseph had been the theme of every\r\nconversation. Every one had something to relate of his affability, his\r\ncondescension, or his goodness. His bon mots, too, were in every mouth;\r\nand the Parisians, who at every epoch have been so addicted to wit, were\r\nso much the more enraptured with the impromptu good things which fell\r\nfrom Joseph's lips, that the Bourbons were entirely deficient in\r\nsprightliness.\r\n\r\nEvery man had an anecdote to relate that concerned Joseph. Yesterday he\r\nhad visited the Hotel-Dieu. He had even asked for admission to the\r\napartments of the lying-in women, and upon being refused entrance by the\r\nsisters, he had said, \"Do let me see the first scene of human misery.\"\r\nThe sisters, struck by the words as well as by the noble bearing of the\r\nstranger, had admitted him; and upon taking leave he had remarked to the\r\nnun who accompanied him, \"The sufferings which you witness in this room,\r\nreconcile you without doubt to the vows you have made.\" It was only\r\nafter his departure that his rank was discovered, and this by means of\r\nthe gift he left in the hands of the prioress--a draft upon the imperial\r\nexchequer of forty-eight thousand livres.\r\n\r\nA few days previous, he had sought entrance to the \"Jardin des Plantes;\"\r\nbut the porter had refused to open the gates until a larger number of\r\nvisitors should arrive. So the emperor, instead of discovering himself,\r\ntook a seat under the trees and waited quietly until the people had\r\nassembled. On his return, he had given eight louis d'ors to the porter;\r\nand thus the latter had learned his majesty's rank.\r\n\r\nAgain--the emperor had called upon Buffon, announcing himself simply as\r\na traveller. Buffon who was indisposed, had gone forward to receive his\r\nguest in a dressing-gown. His embarrassment, as he recognized his\r\nimperial visitor, had been very great. But Joseph, laughing, said, \"When\r\nthe scholar comes to visit his teacher, do you suppose that he troubles\r\nhimself about the professor's costume?\"\r\n\r\nThat was not all. He was equally affable with artists. He talked daily\r\nwith the painters in the Louvre; and having paid a visit to the great\r\nactor Le Kain, whom he had seen the night before in the character of a\r\nRoman emperor, he found him like Buffon in a dressing-gown.\r\n\r\nWhen Le Kain would have apologized, the emperor had said, \"Surely\r\nemperors need not be so fastidious one toward the other!\"\r\n\r\n\"The emperor goes everywhere,\" cried a voice in the crowd. \"Yesterday he\r\npaid a visit to one of the tribunals and remained during the sitting. He\r\nwas recognized, and the president would have assigned him a seat among\r\nthe council, but the emperor declined and remained in a trellised-box\r\nwith the other spectators.\"\r\n\r\n\"How!\" cried another voice, \"the emperor sat in a little common\r\ntrellised-box?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the first speaker, \"he was in one of those boxes called\r\nlanterns. Even Marsorio and Pasquin had something to say on the\r\nsubject.\" [Foreword: Marsorio and Pasquin were the anonymous wits of the\r\npeople, the authors of all the epigrams and pasquinades which were\r\npasted about the streets and originated with--nobody. Marsorio and\r\nPasquin still exist in Rome.]\r\n\r\n\"What did they say? Tell us what said our good friends, Marsorio and\r\nPasquin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here it is. I found it pasted on a corner of the Palais Royal and I\r\ntore it down and put it in my pocket. Shall I read it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" cried the multitude; and it was whispered among them that\r\nthis was Riquelmont, the author of the satires that were sung on the\r\nPont-Neuf, and were attributed to Marsorio and Pasquin.\r\n\r\n\"Now, gentlemen, listen!\"\r\n\r\nAnd with a loud voice, Riquelmont began to read:\r\n\r\n\"MANSORIO.--Grand miracle. Pasquin. Le soleil dans une lanterne!\r\n\r\nPASQUIN.--Allons done, to me Hernes!\r\n\r\nMANSORIO.-Pour to dire le vrai, tiens: Dioggne en vain Cherehait jadis\r\nun homme, une lanterne a la main, Eh bien, a Paris ce matin Il l'eut\r\ntrouve dans la lanterne.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good, good!\" cried the listeners, \"the emperor is indeed a wonderful--\"\r\n\r\nJust then the bell for the curtain was heard, and the crowd pressed into\r\nthe parterre. Amid the profoundest stillness the opera began. Before the\r\nfirst scene had ended, a slight rustling of chairs was heard in the\r\nking's box, and all eyes were turned thither. The whole royal family,\r\nwith the exception of the king, were there; and in their midst,\r\nloveliest of all, appeared the, young queen, brilliant with youth,\r\ngrace, and beauty as she bent her head, and, with bewitching smiles,\r\nreturned the greetings of her subjects.\r\n\r\nThe audience broke out into a storm of rapturous applause, and Marie\r\nAntoinette, kissing her fair hand, took her seat and prepared to listen\r\nto the music.\r\n\r\nBut the spectators were less interested in \"Iphigenia\" than in the\r\nimperial box. Their eyes were continually seeking the emperor, who,\r\nconcealed behind the heavy velvet draperies, was absorbed in the\r\nperformance. At one stage of the representation, Iphigenia is led in\r\ntriumph through the Greek camp, while a chorus of Thessalians sing--\r\n\"Que d'attraits que de majeste; Que de graces l que de beaute! Chantons,\r\ncelebrons notre reine!\"\r\n\r\nThe audience took the cue and transformed themselves into actors. Every\r\neye and every head turned to the royal box, and for the sea and time\r\nevery hand was raised to applaud. From boxes, galleries, and parquet,\r\nthe cry was, \"Da capo, da capo! Again that chorus!\"\r\n\r\nThe singer who represented Achilles comprehended that the enthusiasm of\r\nthe spectators was not for the music.\r\n\r\nEnchanted with the idea, of being the mouthpiece of the people, he\r\nstepped to the front of the stage, and raising his arm in the direction\r\nof the royal box, he repeated the line,\r\n\r\n\"Chantons, celebrons notre reine!\"\r\n\r\nThe heart of the young queen overflowed with excess of joy. She leaned\r\ntoward the emperor, and gently drawing him forward, the brother and\r\nsister both acknowledged the graceful compliment. The emperor was\r\nsaluted with shouts, and the singers began for the second time,\r\n\"Chantons, celebrons notre reine!\" The people, with one accord, rose\r\nfrom their seats, and now, on every side, even from the stage, were\r\nheard the cries of \"Long live our queen! Long live the emperor!\"\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette, leaning on her brother's arm, bent forward again, and,\r\nfor the third time, the singers, and with them the people sang,\r\n\"Chantons, eelebrons notre reine!\"\r\n\r\nThis time, every occupant of the imperial box rose to return\r\nacknowledgments, and the audience began for the fourth time,\r\n\r\n\"Chantons, celebrons notre reine!\"\r\n\r\nThe queen was so overcome, that she could no longer restrain her tears.\r\nShe tried to incline her head, but her emotion overpowered her, and\r\ncovering her face with her handkerchief, she leaned upon the shoulder of\r\nher brother, and wept.\r\n\r\nThe applause ceased. The emotion of Marie Antoinette had communicated\r\nitself to her worshippers, and many an eye was dimmed with sympathetic\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in the parterre, a tall, manly form arose from his seat, and,\r\npointing to the queen, recited the following couplet\r\n\r\n\"Si le peuple pout esperer Qu'il hui sera permis de rire, Ce n'est que\r\nsons l'heureux empire Des princes qui savent pleurer.\"\r\n\r\nThis happy impromptu was enthusiastically received. Marie Antoinette had\r\ndried her tears to listen, and as she prepared to leave the theatre, she\r\nturned to her brother, and said\r\n\r\n\"Oh! that I could die now! Death would be welcome, for in this proud\r\nmoment I have emptied my cup of earthly joy!\" [Footnote: \"Memoires de\r\nWeber,\" vol i., p. 45.--Memoires de Madame de Campan, vol. i., p. 127.\r\n--Hubner, \"Life of Joseph II,\" page 142.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE HOTEL TURENNE.\r\n\r\nThe host of the Hotel Turenne had punctually obeyed the orders of Count\r\nFalkenstein. He had taken every applicant for rooms, whether he came in\r\nan ignominious hackney-coach or in a magnificent carriage.\r\n\r\nBut now every room was taken, and the host, fearful of consequences, was\r\nwaiting for the emperor to appear, that he might be informed of the\r\nimportant fact.\r\n\r\nIn ten or fifteen minutes, his imperial majesty was seen coming down the\r\nstaircase, and Monsieur Louis approached, with a low bow.\r\n\r\n\"May I have the honor of speaking with Count Falkenstein?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said the count. \"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wished to inform monsieur le comte, that my hotel is full to the\r\ngarret. Should monsieur le comte, then, see a traveller leaving my door,\r\nhe will know that I am not infringing his imp--his orders, I mean. I\r\nhave not a single room left.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your hotel is popular. I congratulate you. But I am not at all\r\nsurprised, for you make your visitors exceedingly comfortable.\"\r\n\r\n\"A thousand thanks, monsieur le comte, but that is not the reason. I\r\nhave never been so thronged before. It is all owing to the honor\r\nconferred upon me by your--, I mean by monsieur le comte. It will be a\r\nheavy disappointment to all who apply to hear that I have no room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Louis,\" said the emperor, \"you are mistaken. There are two\r\nempty rooms, opening into mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"But monsieur le comte, it is impossible for me to let those rooms, for\r\nnot only every word spoken in your own room can be overheard there, but\r\nyourself will be disturbed by hearing all that is said by the occupants.\r\nYou see that these rooms cannot be occupied, monsieur le comte.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see nothing of the sort,\" said Joseph, laughing. \"Not only are you\r\nwelcome to let those two rooms, but I request you to do so. Let no man\r\nbe incommoded on my account. I shall know how to submit to the\r\ninconvenience which may be entailed upon me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he certainly is the most condescending and humane prince that I\r\never heard of,\" thought Monsieur Louis, as the emperor's carriage drove\r\noff. \"And one thing is certain--I shall be careful whom I give him for\r\nneighbors. I do not believe a word of what the Count de Provence's valet\r\nsays, that he wants to take Alsace and Lorraine, and has come to France\r\nto change the ministry. The king's brothers are not over-fond of the\r\nqueen nor of the emperor but the people love them, and everybody in\r\nParis envies me, now that I have the great emperor as my guest.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Monsieur Louis, with head erect and hands folded behind him, went up\r\nand down his entrance hall, enjoying the sunshine of his favor with\r\nprinces.\r\n\r\n\"I do wish nobody else would come here,\" thought he, in an ecstasy of\r\ndisinterestedness. \"Suppose that the enemies of his majesty should\r\nintroduce a murderer in my house, and the emperor should lose his life!\r\nI should be eternally disgraced. I am really responsible to his\r\nmajesty's subjects for his safety. I am resolved, since he has commanded\r\nme to let these rooms, to allow none but ladies to occupy them.\"\r\n\r\nFilled with enthusiasm at this fortunate idea, the host walked to the\r\ndoor, and shook his fist at mankind in general--above all to that\r\nsegregate of the male species who might happen to be entertaining\r\nthoughts of lodging at the Hotel Turenne.\r\n\r\nPresently a travelling-chariot came thundering to the door. Monsieur\r\nLouis peered with his keen, black eyes into the vehicle, and, to his\r\ngreat relief, saw two ladies.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman who accompanied them asked to be accommodated with two\r\nrooms; and the host, in his joy, not only opened the coach door himself,\r\nbut took the huge silver candelabrum from the butler's hand, and lighted\r\nthe company himself to their apartments. As they reached the landing, a\r\ncarriage stopped before the door, and a manly voice was heard in the\r\nvestibule below.\r\n\r\n\"How lucky for me that these happened to be women,\" thought Monsieur\r\nLouis, \"for there is the emperor already returned from the theatre!\"\r\n\r\nHe opened the door of the anteroom, and his guests followed him in\r\nsilence. Not a word had been spoken by either of the ladies, and nothing\r\nwas to be seen of their faces through the thick veils which covered\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Do the ladies require supper?\" inquired the host.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied the gentleman whom Monsieur Louis took to be the\r\nhusband of the lady who had seated herself. \"The best you can provide;\r\nand let it be ready in quarter of an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will madame be served in this room?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and see that we have plenty of light. Above all, be quick.\"\r\n\r\n\"This gentleman is very curt,\" thought the host, as he left the room.\r\n\"What if he should entertain evil designs?--I must be on my guard.\" Then\r\nreturning, he added, \"Pardon, monsieur, for how many will supper be\r\nserved?\"\r\n\r\nThe stranger cast a singular glance at the lady in the arm-chair, and\r\nsaid in a loud and somewhat startling voice, \"For two only.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" thought the host, \"the other one is a lady's maid. So much the\r\nworse. They are people of quality, and all that tribe hate the emperor.\r\nI must be on my guard.\"\r\n\r\nSo Monsieur Louis determined to warn the emperor; but first he attended\r\nto his professional duties. \"Supper for the guests just arrived!\" cried\r\nhe to the chief butler. \"Plenty of light for the chandeliers and\r\ncandelabra! Let the cook be apprised that he must be ready before\r\nfifteen minutes.\"\r\n\r\nHaving delivered himself of these orders, the host hastened to inform\r\nthe emperor's valet, Gunther, of his uneasiness and suspicions.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the garcons were going hither and thither preparing supper\r\nfor the strangers. Scarcely ten minutes had elapsed before the first\r\ncourse was upon the table, and the butler, with a bow, announced the\r\nsupper.\r\n\r\nThe singular pair for whom these costly preparations had been made,\r\nspoke not a word to each other. The lady, motionless, kept within the\r\nprivacy of her veil; and the gentleman, who was watching the waiters\r\nwith an ugly frown, looked vexed and impatient.\r\n\r\n\"Retire, all of you,\" said be, imperiously. \"I shall have the honor of\r\nwaiting on madame myself.\"\r\n\r\nThe butler bowed, and, with his well-bred subordinates, left the room.\r\n\r\n\"Now, madame,\" said the stranger, with a glance of dislike, to the\r\nlady's maid, \"do you leave the room also. Go and attend to your own\r\nwants. Good-night.\"\r\n\r\nThe maid made no reply, but remained standing in the window as though\r\nnothing had been said.\r\n\r\n\"You seem not to hear,\" said the stranger. \"I order you to leave this\r\nroom, and, furthermore, I order you to return to your place as a\r\nservant, and not to show yourself here in any other capacity. Go, and\r\nheed my words!\"\r\n\r\nThe lady's maid smiled derisively and replied, \"Count, I await my lady's\r\norders.\"\r\n\r\nThe veiled lady then spoke. \"Gratify the count, my good Dupont,\" said\r\nshe, kindly. \"I do not need you to-night. Let the host provide you with\r\na comfortable room, and go to rest. You must be exhausted.\"\r\n\r\n\"At last, at last we are alone,\" exclaimed the count as the door closed\r\nupon his enemy, the lady's maid.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we are alone,\" repeated the lady, and, throwing off her wrappings,\r\nthe tall and elegant form of the Countess Esterhazy was disclosed to\r\nview.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE DENOUEMENT.\r\n\r\nFor a moment they confronted each other; then Count Schulenberg, with\r\nopen arms, advanced toward the countess.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Margaret,\" cried he, \"you are mine. I have earned this victory by\r\nmy superhuman patience. It is achieved--I am rewarded--come to my\r\nlonging heart!\"\r\n\r\nHe would have clasped her in his arms, but she stepped back, and again,\r\nas in her dressing-room at Vienna, her hands were raised to ward him\r\noff. \"Do not touch me,\" said she, with a look of supreme aversion. \"Come\r\nno nearer, Count Schulenberg, for your breath is poison, and the\r\natmosphere of your proximity is stifling me.\"\r\n\r\nThe count laughed. \"My beautiful Margaret, you seek in vain to\r\ndiscourage me by your charming sarcasm. Oh, my lovely, untamed angel,\r\naway with your coldness! it inflames my passion so much the more. I\r\nwould not give up the triumph of this hour for a kingdom!\"\r\n\r\n\"It will yield you nothing nevertheless, save my contempt. You must\r\nrenounce your dream of happiness, for I assure you that it has been but\r\na dream.\"\r\n\r\n\"You jest still, my Margaret,\" replied the count, with a forced laugh.\r\n\"But I tell you that I intend to tame my wild doe into a submissive\r\nwoman, who loves her master and obeys his call. Away with this mask of\r\nreluctance! You love me; for you have given me the proof of your love by\r\nleaving kindred and honor to follow me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, count I have given you a proof of my contempt, for I have\r\ndeliberately used you as a tool. You, the handsome and admired Count\r\nSchulenberg--you who fancied you were throwing me the handkerchief of\r\nyour favor, you are nothing to me but the convenient implement of my\r\nrevenge. You came hither as my valet, and as I no longer need a valet, I\r\ndischarge you. You have served me well, and I thank you. You have done\r\nadmirably, for Dupont told me to-day that you had not yet exhausted the\r\nmoney I gave you for the expenses of our journey. I am, therefore,\r\nhighly satisfied with you, and will recommend you to any other woman\r\ndesirous of bringing disgrace upon her husband.\"\r\n\r\nThe count stared at her in perfect wonder. He smiled, too--but the smile\r\nwas sinister and threatened evil.\r\n\r\n\"How!\" said the countess. \"You are not yet gone! True--I forgot--a lady\r\nhas no right to discharge her valet without paying him.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words she drew a purse from her pocket and threw it at his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nA loud grating laugh was the reply. He set his foot upon the purse, and\r\nfolding his arms, contemplated the countess with a look that boded no\r\ngood to his tormentor.\r\n\r\n\"You do not go, Count Schulenberg?\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"No--and what is more, I do not intend to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" cried Margaret, her eyes glowing like coals, \"you are dishonorable\r\nenough to persist, when I have told you that I despise you!\"\r\n\r\n\"My charming Margaret, this is a way that women have of betraying their\r\nlove. You all swear that you despise us; all the while loving us to\r\ndistraction. You and I have gone too far to recede. You, because you\r\nallowed me to take you from your husband's house; I, because I gave in\r\nto your rather exacting whims, and came to Paris as your valet. But you\r\npromised to reward me, and I must receive my wages.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promised when we should reach Paris to speak the truth, Count\r\nSchulenberg; and as you are not satisfied with as much as I have\r\nvouchsafed, hear the whole truth. You say that in consenting to\r\naccompany you, I gave a proof of love. Think better of me, sir! Had I\r\nloved you, I might have died for you, but never would I have allowed you\r\nto be the partner of my disgrace. You have shared it with me precisely\r\nbecause I despise you, precisely because there was no man on earth whom\r\nI was less likely to love. As the partner of my flight, you have freed\r\nme from the shackles of a detested union, to rupture which, I underwent\r\nthe farce of an elopement. The tyranny of Maria Theresa had compelled me\r\nto marriage with a wretch who succeeded in beguiling me to the altar by\r\na lie. I swore to revenge myself, and you have been the instrument of my\r\nrevenge. The woman who could condescend to leave her home with you, is\r\nso doubly-dyed in disgrace that Count Esterhazy can no longer refuse to\r\ngrant her a divorce. And now, count, that I have concealed nothing,\r\noblige me by leaving me--I need repose.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my bewitching Margaret, a thousand times no!\" replied the count.\r\n\"But since you have been so candid, I shall imitate your charming\r\nfrankness Your beauty, certainly, is quite enough to madden a man, and\r\nembolden him to woo you, since all Vienna knows how the Countess\r\nEsterhazy hates her husband. But you seemed colder to me than you were\r\nto other men, all of whom complained that you had no heart to win. I\r\nswore not to be foiled by your severity, and thereupon my friends staked\r\na large wager upon the result. Fired by these united considerations, I\r\nentered upon my suit and was successful. You gave me very little\r\ntrouble, I must say that for you, countess. Thanks to your clemency, I\r\nhave won my bet, and on my return to Vienna, I am to receive one\r\nthousand louis d'ors.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am delighted to hear it, and I advise you to go after them with all\r\nspeed,\" replied the countess quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me if I reject the advice--for, as I told you before, I really\r\nlove you. You have thrown yourself into my arms, and I would be a fool\r\nnot to keep you there. No, my enchantress, no. Give up all hope of\r\nescaping from the fate you have chosen for yourself. For my sake you\r\nhave branded your fair fame forever, and you shall be rewarded for the\r\nsacrifice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wretch,\" cried she, drawing herself proudly up to her full height, \"you\r\nwell know that you had no share in the motives of the flight! Its shame\r\nis mine alone; and alone will I bear it. To you I leave the ridicule of\r\nour adventure, for if you do not quit my room, I shall take care that\r\nall Vienna hears how I took you to Paris as my valet.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I, Countess Esterbazy, shall entertain all Vienna with the contents\r\nof your album, which I have taken the liberty not only of reading, but\r\nof appropriating.\"\r\n\r\nThe countess gave a start. \"True,\" murmured she, \"I have missed it since\r\nyesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I have it. I think a lover has a right to his mistress's\r\nsecrets, and I have made use of my right. I have been reading your\r\nheavenly verses to the object of your unhappy attachment, and all Vienna\r\nshall hear them. What delicious scandal it will be to tell how\r\ndesperately in love is the Countess Esterhazy with the son of her\r\ngracious and imperial godmother!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell it then,\" cried Margaret, \"tell it if you will, for I do love the\r\nemperor! My heart bows down before him in idolatrous admiration, and if\r\nhe loved ME, I would not envy the angels their heaven! He does not\r\nreturn my love--nor do I need that return to make me cherish and foster\r\nmy passion for him. No scorn of the world can lessen it, for it is my\r\npride, my religion, my life! And now go and repeat my words; but beware\r\nof me, Count Schulenberg, for I will have revenge!\"\r\n\r\n\"From such fair hands, revenge would fall quite harmless,\" exclaimed the\r\ncount, dazzled by the splendor of Margaret's transcendent beauty; for\r\nnever in her life had she looked lovelier than at that moment. \"Revenge\r\nyourself if you will, enchantress, but mine you are doomed to be. Come,\r\nthen, come!\"\r\n\r\nOnce more he approached, when the door was flung violently open, and a\r\nloud, commanding voice was heard:\r\n\r\n\"I forbid you to lay a finger upon the Countess Esterhazy,\" exclaimed\r\nthe emperor.\r\n\r\nMargaret uttered a loud cry, the color forsook her cheeks, and closing\r\nher eyes she fell back upon the sofa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXV.\r\n\r\nTHE PARTING.\r\n\r\nThe emperor hastened to her assistance, but finding her totally\r\ninsensible, he laid her gently down again.\r\n\r\n\"She is unconscious,\" said he; \"kind Nature has lulled her to\r\ninsensibility--she will recover.\" Then taking the veil from the\r\ncountess's hat, he covered her face, and turned toward the terrified\r\ncount, who, trembling in every limb, was powerless to save himself by\r\nflight.\r\n\r\n\"Give me the countess's album!\" said the emperor sternly. Count\r\nSchulenberg drew it mechanically forth, and, with tottering steps\r\nadvanced and fell at the emperor's feet.\r\n\r\nJoseph tore the book from his hands, and laid it on the sofa by the\r\ncountess. Then returning, he cried out in a tone of indignation, \"Rise!\r\nYou have behaved toward this woman like a dishonorable wretch, and you\r\nare unworthy the name of nobleman. You shall be punished for your\r\ncrimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercy, sire, mercy,\" faltered the count. \"Mercy for a fault which--\"\r\n\r\n\"Peace!\" interrupted Joseph. \"The empress has already sent a courier to\r\norder your arrest. Do you know what is the punishment in Austria for a\r\nman who flies with a married woman from the house of her husband?\"\r\n\r\n\"The punishment of death,\" murmured the count inaudibly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, for it is a crime that equals murder,\" returned the emperor;\r\n\"indeed, it transcends murder, for it loses the soul of the unhappy\r\nwoman, and brands her husband with infamy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercy, mercy!\" prayed the wretch.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Joseph sternly, \"you deserve no mercy. Follow me.\" The\r\nemperor returned to is own room, and opening the door that led to the\r\nanteroom he called Gunther.\r\n\r\nWhen the valet appeared, Joseph pointed to the count, who was advancing\r\nslowly, and now stopped without daring to raise his head.\r\n\r\n\"Gunther,\" said the emperor, \"I give this man in charge to you. I might\r\nrequire him on his honor not to leave this room until I return; but no\r\nman can pledge that which he does not possess; I must, therefore, leave\r\nhim to you. See that he does not make his escape.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor then recrossed his own room, and closing the door behind\r\nhim, entered the apartment of the countess. She had revived; and was\r\nlooking around with an absent, dreamy expression.\r\n\r\n\"I have been sleeping,\" murmured she. \"I saw the emperor, I felt his arm\r\naround me, I dreamed that he was bending over me--\"\r\n\r\n\"It was no dream, Countess Esterhazy,\" said Joseph softly.\r\n\r\nShe started, and rose from the sofa, her whole frame tremulous with\r\nemotion. Her large; glowing eyes seemed to be searching for the object\r\nof her terror, and then her glance rested with inexpressible fear upon\r\nthe door which led into the emperor's room.\r\n\r\n\"You were there, sire, and heard all--all?\" stammered she, pointing with\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--God be praised, I was there, and I am now acquainted with the\r\nmotives which prompted your flight from Count Esterhazy. I undertake\r\nyour defence, countess; my voice shall silence your accusers in Vienna,\r\nand if it becomes necessary to your justification, I will relate what I\r\nhave overheard. I cannot blame you, for I know the unspeakable misery of\r\na marriage without love, and I comprehend that, to break its fetters,\r\nyou were ready to brave disgrace, and to wear upon your spotless brow\r\nthe badge of dishonor The empress must know what you have undergone, and\r\nshe shall reinstate you in the world's estimation; for she it is who has\r\ncaused your unhappiness. My mother is too magnanimous to refuse\r\nreparation where she has erred.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" whispered the countess, while a deep blush overspread her face,\r\n\"do you mean to confide all--all to the empress?\"\r\n\r\n\"All that concerns your relations with your husband and with Count\r\nSchulenberg. Pardon me that I overheard the sweet confession which was\r\nwrung from you by despair! Never will I betray it to living mortal; it\r\nshall be treasured in the depths of my heart, and sometimes at midnight\r\nhour I may be permitted to remember it. I--Come back to Vienna,\r\ncountess, and let us seek to console each other for the agony of the\r\npast!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sire,\" said she mournfully, \"I shall never return to Vienna; I\r\nshould be ashamed to meet your majesty's eye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you grown so faint-hearted?\" said the emperor, gently. \"Are you\r\nsuddenly ashamed of a feeling which you so nobly avowed but a few\r\nmoments since? Or am I the only man on earth who is unworthy to know\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, the judgment of the world is nothing to me; it is from your\r\ncontempt that I would fly and be forgotten. Let other men judge me as\r\nthey will--I care not. But oh! I know that you despise me, and that\r\nknowledge is breaking my heart. Farewell, then, forever!\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor contemplated her with mournful sympathy, and took both her\r\nhands in his. She pressed them to her lips, and when she raised her\r\nhead, her timidity had given place to strong resolution.\r\n\r\n\"I shall never see your majesty again,\" said she, \"but your image will\r\nbe with me wherever I go. I hope for great deeds from you, and I know\r\nthat you will not deceive me, sire. When all Europe resounds with your\r\nfame, then shall I be happy, for my being is merged in yours. At this\r\nmoment, when we part to meet no more, I say again with joyful courage, I\r\nlove you: May the blessing of that love rest upon your noble head! Give\r\nme your hand once more, and then leave me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, Margaret,\" faltered the emperor, intoxicated by her tender\r\navowal, and opening his arms, be added in passionate tones,\r\n\r\n\"Come to my heart, and let me, for one blissful moment, feel the\r\nbeatings of yours! Come, oh, come!\"\r\n\r\nMargaret leaned her head upon his shoulder and wept, while the emperor\r\nbesought her to relent and return to Vienna with him.\r\n\r\n\"No, sire,\" replied she, firmly. \"Farewell!\"\r\n\r\nHe echoed \"farewell,\" and hastily left the room.\r\n\r\nWhen the door had closed upon him, the countess covered her face with\r\nher hands and sobbed aloud. But this was for a moment only.\r\n\r\nHer pale face resumed its haughty expression as she rose from her seat\r\nand hastily pulled the bell-rope. A few minutes later, she unbolted the\r\ndoor, and Madame Dupont entered the room.\r\n\r\n\"My good friend,\" said the countess, \"we leave Paris to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alone?\" asked the maid, looking around.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; rejoice with me, we are rid of him forever. But we must leave this\r\nplace at once. Go and order post-horses.\"\r\n\r\n\"But dear lady, whither do we journey?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whither?\" echoed Margaret, thoughtfully. \"Let the will of God decide.\r\nWho can say whence we come, or whither we go?\"\r\n\r\nThe faithful servant hastened to her mistress, and taking the hand of\r\nthe countess in hers, pressed it to her lips. \"Oh, my lady,\" said she,\r\n\"shake off this lethargy--be your own brave self again.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Dupont,\" returned Margaret, shaking back her long black\r\nhair, which had become unfastened and fell almost to her feet, \"I must\r\ncontrol my grief that I may act for myself. From this day I am without\r\nprotector, kindred, or borne. Let us journey to the Holy Land, Dupont.\r\nPerhaps I may find consolation by the grave of the Saviour.\"\r\n\r\nOne hour later, the emperor, sitting at his window, heard a carriage\r\nleave the Hotel Turenne. He followed the sound until it was lost in the\r\ndistance; for well he knew that the occupant of that coach was the\r\nbeautiful and unfortunate Countess Esterhazy.\r\n\r\nEarly on the following morning another carriage with blinds drawn up,\r\nleft the hotel. It stopped before the Austrian embassy, and the valet of\r\nthe emperor sprang out. He signified to the porter that he was to keep a\r\nstrict watch over the gentleman within, and then sought the presence of\r\nthe Count von Mercy.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour went by, during which the porter had been peering\r\ncuriously at the pale face which was staring at the windows of the\r\nhotel. Presently a secretary and a servant of the ambassador came out\r\nequipped for a journey. The secretary entered the carriage; the servant\r\nmounted the box, and Count Schulenberg was transported a prisoner to\r\nVienna. [Footnote: Count Schulenberg was sentenced to death; and Maria\r\nTheresa, who was inexorable where a breach of morals was concerned,\r\napproved the sentence. But Count Esterhazy hastened to intercede for his\r\nrival, acknowledging at last that Schulenberg had freed him from a tie\r\nwhich was a curse to him.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXVI.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH AND LOUIS.\r\n\r\nThe emperor was right when he said that his sister would derive little\r\npleasure from his visit to Paris. Her happiness in his society had been\r\nof short duration; for she could not be but sensible of the growing\r\ndislike of the king for his imperial brother-in-law. Joseph's easy and\r\ngraceful manners were in humiliating contrast to the stiff and awkward\r\nbearing of Louis; and finally, Marie Antoinette felt many a pang as she\r\nwatched the glances of aversion which her husband cast upon her brother,\r\nat such times as the latter made light of the thousand and one\r\nceremonies which were held so sacred by the royal family of France.\r\n\r\nThe king, who in his heart had been sorely galled by the fetters of\r\nFrench etiquette, now that the emperor ridiculed it, became its warmest\r\npartisan; and went so far as to reprove his wife for following her\r\nbrother's example, and sacrificing her royal dignity to an absurd\r\nlonging for popularity.\r\n\r\nThe truth was, that Louis was envious of the enthusiasm which Joseph\r\nexcited among the Parisians; and his brothers, the other members of the\r\nroyal family, and his ministers, took every opportunity of feeding his\r\nenvy, by representing that the emperor was doing his utmost to alienate\r\nthe affections of the French from their rightful sovereign; that he was\r\nmeditating the seizure of Alsace and Lorraine; that he was seeking to\r\nreinstate De Choiseul, and convert France into a mere dependency upon\r\nAustria.\r\n\r\nLouis, who had begun to regard his wife with passionate admiration,\r\nbecame cold and sarcastic in his demeanor toward her. The hours which,\r\nuntil the emperor's arrival in Paris, he had spent with Marie\r\nAntoinette, were now dedicated to his ministers, to Madame Adelaide, and\r\neven to the Count de Provence--that brother whose enmity to the queen\r\nwas not even concealed under a veil of courtly dissimulation.\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with filling the king's ears with calumnies of his poor\r\nyoung wife, the Count de Provence was the instigator of all those\r\nscandalous songs, in which the emperor and the queen were daily\r\nridiculed on the Pont-Neuf; and of the multifarious caricatures which,\r\nhour by hour, were rendering Marie Antoinette odious in the eyes of her\r\nsubjects. The Count de Provence, who afterward wore his murdered\r\nbrother's crown, was the first to teach the French nation that odiouus\r\nepithet of \"d'Autrichienne,\" with which they hooted the Queen of France\r\nto an ignominious death upon the scaffold.\r\n\r\nThe momentary joy which the visit of the emperor had caused to his\r\nsister had vanished, and given place to embarrassment and anxiety of\r\nheart. Even she felt vexed, not only that her subjects preferred a\r\nforeign prince to their own rightful sovereign, but that Joseph was so\r\nunrestrained in his sarcasms upon royal customs in France. Finally she\r\nwas obliged to confess in the silence of her own heart, that her\r\nbrother's departure would be a relief to her, and that these dinners en\r\nfamille, to which he came daily as a guest, were inexpressibly tedious\r\nand heavy.\r\n\r\nOne day the emperor came earlier than usual to dinner--so early, in\r\nfact, that the king was still occupied holding his daily levee.\r\n\r\nJoseph seated himself quietly in the anteroom to await his turn. At\r\nfirst no one had remarked his entrance; but presently he was recognized\r\nby one of the marshals of the household, who hastened to his side, and,\r\napologizing, offered to inform the king at once of Count Falkenstein's\r\npresence there.\r\n\r\n\"By no means,\" returned the emperor, \"I am quite accustomed to this sort\r\nof thing. I do it every morning in my mother's ante-room at Vienna.\"\r\n[Footnote: Memoires de Weber, vol. i., p. 98.]\r\n\r\nJust then the door opened, and the king, who had been apprised of the\r\nemperor's arrival, carne forward to greet him.\r\n\r\n\"We were not aware that we had so distinguished a guest in our\r\nanteroom,\" said Louis, bowing. \"But come, my brother.\" continued he\r\ncordially, \"the weather is beautiful. Let us stroll together in the\r\ngardens. Give me your arm.\"\r\n\r\nBut Joseph, pointing to the crowd, replied, \"Pardon me, your majesty, it\r\nis not yet my turn; and I should be sorry to interrupt you in your\r\nduties as sovereign.\"\r\n\r\nLouis frowned; and all traces of cordiality vanished from his face. \"I\r\nwill receive these gentlemen to-morrow,\" said he, with a slight nod to\r\nhis courtiers; and they, comprehending that they were dismissed, took\r\ntheir leave.\r\n\r\n\"Now, count,\" pursued the king, trying to smile, but scarcely succeeding\r\nin doing so, \"we are at liberty.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he bowed, but did not repeat the offer of his arm; he walked\r\nby the emperor's side. The usher threw open the doors, crying out in\r\naloud voice:\r\n\r\n\"The king is about to take a walk!\"\r\n\r\n\"The king is about to take a walk,\" was echoed from point to point; and\r\nnow from every side of the palace came courtiers and gentlemen in\r\nwaiting, to attend their sovereign; while outside on the terrace the\r\nblast of trumpets was heard, so that everybody in Versailles was made\r\naware that the king was about to take a turn in his garden, and his\r\nanxious subjects, if so disposed, might pray for his safe return.\r\n\r\nThe emperor looked on and listened with an amused smile, highly diverted\r\nat the avalanche of courtiers that came rushing on them from corridor\r\nand staircase. Meanwhile the sovereigns pursued their way in solemn\r\nsilence until the brilliant throng had descended the marble stairs that\r\nled from the terrace to the gardens. Then came another flourish of\r\ntrumpets, one hundred Swiss saluted the king, and twelve gardes de corps\r\nadvanced to take their places close to the royal promenaders.\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" asked Joseph, stopping, \"are all these people to accompany us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, count,\" replied Louis, \"this attendance upon me when I walk\r\nis prescribed by court etiquette.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear brother, allow me to state that it gives us much more the\r\nappearance of state prisoners than of free sovereigns enjoying the fresh\r\nair. In the presence of God let us be simple men--our hearts will be\r\nmore apt to be elevated by the sight of the beauties of nature, than if\r\nwe go surrounded by all this `pomp and circumstance' of royalty.\"\r\n\r\n\"You wish to go without attendants?\" asked Louis.\r\n\r\n\"I ask of your majesty as a favor to let me act as a body-guard to the\r\nKing of France to-day. I promise to serve him faithfully in that\r\ncapacity--moreover, have we not this brilliant suite of noblemen to\r\ndefend us in case of danger?\"\r\n\r\nThe king made no reply. He merely turned to the captain of the Swiss\r\nguard to inform him that their majesties would dispense with military\r\nescort. The officer was so astounded that he actually forgot to make his\r\nsalute.\r\n\r\nAt the gate of the park the king also dismissed the gardes de corps.\r\nThese were quite as astonished as the Swiss had been before there; for\r\nnever until that day had a King of France taken a walk in his gardens\r\nwithout one hundred Swiss and twelve body-guards. [Footnote: Hubner, i.,\r\np. 148.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE PROMENADE AND THE EPIGRAM.\r\n\r\nThe royal brothers-in-law then were allowed to promenade alone; that is\r\nto say, they were attended by twenty courtiers, whose inestimable\r\nprivilege it was to follow the king wherever he went.\r\n\r\n\"It is not then the custom in Austria for princes to appear in public\r\nwith their escort?\" asked the king, after a long pause.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, we have our body-guards, but they are the people themselves,\r\nand we feel perfectly secure in their escort. You should try this\r\nbody-guard, sire; it is more economical than yours, for its service is\r\nrendered for pure love.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied the king carelessly, \"it is a very cheap way of\r\ncourting popularity: but the price would be too dear for a king of\r\nFrance to pay--he cannot afford to sell his dignity for such small\r\nreturn.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor raised his large blue eyes, and looked full in the king's\r\nface. \"Do you really think,\" he said, \"that a king compromises his\r\ndignity by contact with his subjects? Do you think that to be honored by\r\nyour people you must be forever reminding them of your `right divine?'\r\nI, on the contrary, believe that the sovereign who shows himself to be a\r\nman, is the one who will be most sincerely loved by the men whom he\r\ngoverns. We are apt to become dazzled by the glare of flattery, sire,\r\nand it is well for us sometimes to throw off our grandeur, and mix among\r\nour fellows. There we will soon find out that majesty is not written\r\nupon the face of kings, but resides in the purple which is the work of\r\nthe tailor, and the crown, which is that of the goldsmith. I learned\r\nthis not long ago from a shoemaker's apprentice.\"\r\n\r\n\"From a shoemaker's apprentice!\" exclaimed Louis, with a supercilious\r\nsmile. \"It would be highly edifying to hear from the Count of\r\nFalkenstein how it happened that the Emperor of Austria was taught the\r\nnothingness of royalty by a shoemaker's lad!\"\r\n\r\n\"It came quite naturally, sire. I was out driving in a plain cabriolet,\r\nwhen I remarked the boy, who was singing, and otherwise exercising his\r\nanimal spirits by hopping, dancing, and running along the road by the\r\nside of the vehicle. I was much diverted by his drollery, and finally\r\ninvited him to take a drive with me. He jumped in--without awaiting a\r\nsecond invitation, stared wonderfully at me with his great brown eyes,\r\nand in high satisfaction kicked his feet against the dash-board, and\r\nwatched the motion of the wheels. Now and then he vented his delight by\r\na broad smile, in which I could detect no trace of a suspicion as to my\r\nrank of majesty. Finally I resolved to find out what place I occupied in\r\nthe estimation of an unfledged shoemaker; so I questioned him on the\r\nsubject. He contemplated me for a moment, and then said, `Perhaps you\r\nmight be an equerry?'--'Guess higher,' replied I. 'Well, a count?'--I\r\nshook my head. 'Still higher.'--'A prince?'--'Higher yet.'--'Well,\r\nthen, you must be the emperor.'--'You have guessed,' said I. Instead of\r\nbeing overcome by the communication, the boy sprang from the cabriolet\r\nand pointing at me with a little finger that was full of scorn and dirt,\r\nhe cried out to the passers-by, 'Only, look at him! he is trying to pass\r\nhimself off for the emperor.'\" [Footnote: \"Characteristics and Anecdotes\r\nof Joseph II, and his Times,\" p. 106.]\r\n\r\nLouis had listened to this recital with grave composure, and as his face\r\nhad not once relaxed from its solemnity, the faces of his courtiers all\r\nwore a similar expression. As Joseph looked around, he saw a row of\r\nblank countenances.\r\n\r\nThere was an awkward pause. Finally the king observed that he could not\r\nsee any thing diverting in the insolence of the boy.\r\n\r\n\"I assure your majesty,\" replied the emperor, \"that it was far more\r\npleasing to me than the subservience of a multitude of fawning\r\ncourtiers.\" He glanced sharply at the gentlemen of their suite, who knit\r\ntheir brows in return.\r\n\r\n\"Let us quicken our pace if it be agreeable to you, count,\" said Louis,\r\nwith some embarrassment. The attendants fell back, and the two monarchs\r\nwalked on for some moments, in silence. The king was wondering how he\r\nshould manage to renew the conversation, when suddenly, his voice,\r\ntremulous with emotion, Joseph addressed him.\r\n\r\n\"My brother,\" said he, \"accident at last has favored me, and I may speak\r\nto you for once without witnesses. Tell me, then, why do you hate me?\"\r\n\r\n\"My brother,\" exclaimed Louis, \"who has dared--\"\r\n\r\n\"No one has intimated such a thing,\" returned Joseph, vehemently; \"but I\r\nsee it, I feel it in every look of your majesty's eyes, every word that\r\nfalls from your lips. Again, I ask why do you hate me? I who came hither\r\nto visit you as friend and brother! Or do you believe the idle rumors of\r\nyour courtiers, that I came to rob aught besides the heart of the King\r\nof France? I know that I have been represented as unscrupulous in my\r\nambition, but I entreat of you, dear brother, think better of me. I will\r\nbe frank with you and confess that I DO seek for aggrandizement, but not\r\nat the expense of my allies or friends. I strive to enlarge my\r\nterritory, but I shall claim nothing that is not righteously my own.\r\nThere are provinces in Germany which are mine by right of inheritance,\r\nothers by the right which Frederick used when he took Silesia from the\r\ncrown of Austria.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or that which Joseph used when he took Galicia from the King of\r\nPoland,\" interrupted Louis, significantly.\r\n\r\n\"Sire, we did not take Galicia. It fell to us through the weakness of\r\nPoland, and by reason of exigencies arising from an alliance between the\r\nthree powers. My claim to Bavaria, however, is of another nature. It is\r\nmine by inheritance--the more so that the Elector of Zweybrucken, the\r\nsuccessor of the Elector of Bavaria, is willing to concede me my right\r\nto that province. The Bavarians themselves long for annexation to\r\nAustria, for they know that it is their only road to prosperity. They\r\nlook with hope and confidence to Maria Theresa, whose goodness and\r\ngreatness may compensate them for all that they have endured at the\r\nhands of their pusillanimous little rulers. The only man in Germany who\r\nwill oppose the succession of Austria to Bavaria, is Frederick, who is\r\nas ready to enlarge his own dominions as to cry 'Stop thief!' when he\r\nsees others doing likewise. But he will not raise a single voice unless\r\nhe receive encouragement from other powers. If my visit to France has\r\nany political significance, it is to obtain your majesty's recognition\r\nof my right to Bavaria. Yes, sire, I DO wish to convince you of the\r\njustice of my claim, and to obtain from you the promise of neutrality\r\nwhen I shall be ready to assert it. You see that I speak without\r\nreserve, and confide to you plans which heretofore have been discussed\r\nin secret council at Vienna alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I pledge my royal word never to betray your majesty's confidence to\r\nliving mortal,\" replied Louis, with undisguised embarrassment and\r\nanxiety. \"Believe me when I say that every thing you have spoken is as\r\nthough I had never heard it. I shall bury it within the recesses of my\r\nown heart, and there it shall remain.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor surveyed his brother-in-law with a glance of mistrust. He\r\nthought that the assurance of his secrecy was given in singular\r\nlanguage. He was not altogether satisfied to hear that what he had been\r\nsaying was to be treated as though it had never been said at all.\r\n\r\n\"Will your majesty, then, sustain me?\" asked he of Louis. This direct\r\nquestion staggered his majesty of France. He scarcely knew what he was\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\n\"You ask this question,\" replied he, with a forced smile, \"as if the\r\nelector was dead, and our decision were imperative. Fortunately, his\r\nhighness of Bavaria is in excellent health, and the discussion may\r\nbe--deferred. Let us think of the present. You were wise, my dear\r\nbrother, when you remarked that the beauties of Nature were calculated\r\nto elevate our minds. What royalty can be compared to hers?\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor made no reply. He felt the full significance of the king's\r\nungracious words, and more than ever he was convinced that Louis\r\nregarded him with dislike and ill-will. Again there was a painful\r\nsilence between the two, and every moment it weighed more heavily upon\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nAt last Louis, awaking to a sense of what was due from host to guest,\r\nmade a desperate resolution, and spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Have you made any plans for this evening, my brother?\" asked he\r\ntimidly.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" was the curt reply.\r\n\r\n\"You would be very amiable if, instead of visiting the theatres, you\r\nwould join the queen in a game of cards.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never play,\" returned Joseph. \"A monarch who loses money at cards,\r\nloses the property of his subjects.\" [Footnote: Joseph's own words.\r\nHubner, part i., page 151.]\r\n\r\n\"Since you do not like cards, we have other recreations at hand. How\r\nwould you relish a hunt in the woods of Meudon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" said Joseph. \"Hunting is no recreation for a monarch. HIS\r\ntime is too precious to be frittered away in such idle sport.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said Louis, whose patience was exhausted, \"you imitate your old\r\nenemy, the King of Prussia, who for twenty years has been crying out\r\nagainst the sins of hunting and gambling.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor's face grew scarlet, and his eyes flashed. \"Sire;\" replied\r\nhe, \"allow me to observe to you that I imitate nobody, and that I am\r\nresolved now as ever to conduct myself as I see fit.\"\r\n\r\nTo this the king bowed in silence. He was so weary of his walk that he\r\nled the way to a road by which a short-cut might be made to the palace.\r\nThis road was crossed by an avenue of trees which bordered a large iron\r\ngate leading to the front entrance of the palace. Here the people were\r\naccustomed to assemble to obtain a view of their sovereigns; and to-day\r\nthe throng was greater than usual, for they had learned from the Swiss\r\nguard that the two monarchs were out together, and thousands of eager\r\neyes were watching for the glittering uniforms of the gardes de corps.\r\n\r\nGreat was their astonishment to see two individuals alone; apparently\r\nindependent of the courtiers at some distance behind them.\r\n\r\n\"Who could they be--these two gentlemen advancing together? Certainly\r\nnot the emperor and the king, for the latter never took a step without\r\nhis life-guards.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is the emperor!\" cried a voice in the crowd. \"I know his\r\nhandsome face and his dark-blue eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the other is the king!\" exclaimed another voice.\r\n\r\n\"It cannot be,\" said a third. \"The King of France never moves in his own\r\npalace without a wall of guards around him--how much less in the open\r\nparks, where he is exposed to the danger of meeting his subjects!\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose we are indebted to the emperor for this bold act of his\r\nmajesty to-day\" said another critic.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, he it is who has persuaded the king to trust us,\" cried the\r\nmultitude. \"Let us thank him by a hearty welcome.\"\r\n\r\nThe two princes were now quite near, and the crowd took off their hats.\r\nThe emperor greeted them--with an affable smile; the king with several\r\nnods, but without a shadow of cordiality. Suddenly the air was rent with\r\nshouts, and a thousand voices cried out, \"Long live the emperor!\"\r\n\r\nThe king reddened, but dared not give vent to his displeasure. His eyes\r\nsought the ground, while Joseph, gently shaking his head, looked at the\r\npeople and pointed furtively at their sovereign. They understood him at\r\nonce, and, eager to repair the inadvertence, they shouted, \"Long live\r\nthe emperor! Long live our king, the father of his people!\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor now smiled and waved his band; while the king still\r\ndispleased, bowed gravely and turned toward Joseph.\r\n\r\n\"You are quite right,\" said he, in sharp, cutting accents, \"popularity\r\nis a cheap commodity. A king has only to ride about in hackney-coaches\r\nand put on the people's garb, to become the idol of the lower classes.\r\nThe question, however, is, how long will a popularity of this sort last?\r\n\"\r\n\r\n\"If it be called forth by a hackney-coach and an ordinary dress, sire,\r\nit may be of short duration; but if it is to last, it must be accorded\r\nto real worth,\" replied Joseph, sympathizing with the discontent of the\r\nking.\r\n\r\n\"Which no one would presume to deny in your majesty's case,\" rejoined\r\nLouis with a constrained and awkward bow.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" exclaimed Joseph, blushing, \"I had not understood that your\r\nmajesty's irony was intended for me, else I should not, have answered as\r\nI did. I do not strive after popularity. My actions flow naturally from\r\nmy convictions. These teach me that my natural condition is not that of\r\nan emperor, but of a man, and I conduct myself accordingly.\" [Footnote:\r\nThe emperor's own words. Ramshorn's \"Joseph II.,\" page 146.]\r\n\r\nSo saying, the emperor turned once more to salute the people, and then\r\nascended the white marble steps which led to the terrace of the palace.\r\nThe two monarchs and the glittering courtiers disappeared amid the\r\n\"vivas\" of the multitude, and now they became suddenly silent.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this silence, the same voice which had so sharply\r\ncriticised the king, was heard. Again it spoke as follows\r\n\r\n\"Marsorio has made another epigram, and mistaking me for Pasquin has\r\njust whispered it in my ear!\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he say? Tell us what our good Marsorio says! Repeat the\r\nepigram!\" saluted the speaker on every side.\r\n\r\n\"Here it is,\" returned the voice.\r\n\r\n\"A nos yeux etonnes de sa simplicite Falkenstein a montre la majeste\r\nsans faste; Chez nous par un honteux contraste Qu'a-t'il trouve? Faste\r\nsans majeste.\" [Footnote: Ramshorn, page 146.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE DINNER EN FAMILLE.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the king and the emperor reached the apartment which opened\r\ninto the private dining-room of the royal family. The princes with their\r\nwives were already there; but Marie Antoinette always came at the last\r\nmoment. She dreaded the sarcasm of the Count de Provence, and the sullen\r\nor contemptuous glances of the king. She would have given much to return\r\nto the old stiff, public ceremonial which she had banished, but that she\r\ncould not do. It would have been too great a concession to the court.\r\nHer only refuge was to stay away as long as decorum allowed, and after\r\nthe emperor's arrival she never entered the room until he had been\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\nTo-day she was even later than usual; and the king, who like other\r\nmortals, was hungry after his walk, began to grow sulky at the delay.\r\nWhen at last she entered the room, he scarcely vouchsafed her an\r\ninclination of the head as he rose to conduct her to the table. The\r\nqueen seemed not to perceive the omission. She gave him her hand with a\r\nsweet smile, and despite his ill-humor, Louis could not suppress a throb\r\nas he saw how brilliantly beautiful she was.\r\n\r\n\"You have made us wait, madame,\" said he, \"but your appearance to-day\r\nrepays us for your tardiness.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen smiled again, for well she knew that she was bewitchingly\r\ndressed, and that the new coiffure which Leonard had contrived, was\r\nreally becoming, and would heighten her charms by contrast with the\r\nhideout towers that were heaped, like Pelion upon Ossa, over the heads\r\nof the princesses.\r\n\r\n\"I hope that your majesty will forgive me for being late,\" said she,\r\nsecure in the power of her fascinations. \"My little Jacques is to blame.\r\nHe is sick to-day, and would have no one to put him to sleep but\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty should feel flattered,\" cried the Count de Provence. \"You\r\nare expected to put off your dinner until a little peasant is pleased to\r\ngo to sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your highness,\" said the queen, coloring, \"Jacques is no\r\nlonger a peasant--he is my child.\"\r\n\r\n\"The dauphin, perchance, which your majesty promised not long since to\r\nthe dames de la halle?\" answered the king's brother.\r\n\r\nThe queen blushed so deeply that the flush of her shame overspread her\r\nwhole face and neck; but instead of retorting, she turned to address her\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n\"You have not a word of greeting for me, Joseph?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear sister,\" said the emperor, \"I am speechless with admiration at\r\nyour coiffure. Where did you get such a wilderness of flowers and\r\nfeathers?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are the work of Leonard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is Leonard?\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" interrupted the Countess d'Artois, \"your majesty does not know\r\nwho Leonard is--Leonard the queen's hair dresser--Leonard the autocrat\r\nof fashion? He it is who imagined our lovely sister's coiffure, and\r\ncertainly these feathers are superb!\"\r\n\r\n\"Beautiful indeed!\" cried the Countess de Provence, with an appearance\r\nof ecstasy.\r\n\r\n\"Are these the costly feathers which I heard your majesty admiring in\r\nthe hat of the Duke de Lauzun?\" asked the Count de Provence, pointedly.\r\n\r\n\"That is a curious question,\" remarked the king. \"How should the\r\nfeathers of the Duke de Lauzun be transported to the head of the queen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, I was by, when De Guemenee on the part of De Lauzun, requested\r\nthe queen's acceptance of the feathers.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the queen?\" said Louis, with irritation.\r\n\r\n\"I accepted the gift, sire,\" replied Marie Antoinette, calmly. \"The\r\noffer was not altogether in accordance with court-etiquette, but no\r\ndisrespect was intended, and I could not inflict upon Monsieur de Lauzun\r\nthe humiliation of a refusal. The Count de Provence, however, can spare\r\nhimself further anxiety in the matter, as the feathers that I wear\r\nto-day are those which were lately presented to me by my sister, the\r\nQueen of Naples.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" exclaimed the emperor, \"I was not aware that Caroline gave\r\npresents, although I know that she frequently accepts them from her\r\ncourtiers.\"\r\n\r\n\"The etiquette at Naples differs then from that of Paris,\" remarked the\r\nking. \"No subject has the right to offer a gift to the Queen of France.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven be praised!\" cried the Count de Provence, \"nobody here pays any\r\nattention to court-customs! Since Madame de Noailles gave in her\r\nresignation we have been free to do all things. This inestimable freedom\r\nwe owe to our lovely sister-in-law; who, in defiance of all prejudice,\r\nhas had boldness enough to burst the fetters which for so many hundred\r\nyears bad impeded the actions of the Queens of France.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment the first lady of honor, on bended knee, presented the\r\nqueen her soup, and this relieved Marie Antoinette from the painful\r\nembarrassment which this equivocal compliment occasioned. But the\r\nemperor interposed.\r\n\r\n\"You have reason to be thankful to my sister that she has had the\r\nindependence to attack these absurdities,\" said Joseph, warmly. \"But\r\npardon me if I ask if etiquette at Versailles approves of the conversion\r\nof the corridors, galleries, and staircases of the palace into booths\r\nfor the accommodation of shopkeepers and tradesmen.\" [Footnote: This\r\ncustom was subsequently abolished by Marie Antoinette, and the lower\r\nclasses never forgave her for withdrawing this extraordinary privilege\r\nfrom the hucksters of Palls.]\r\n\r\n\"It is an old privilege which custom has sanctioned,\" returned the king,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n\"But which violates the sanctity of the king's residence,\" objected the\r\nemperor. \"The Saviour who drove the money-changers from the temple,\r\nwould certainly expel these traders, were he to appear on earth to-day.\"\r\n\r\nThis observation was received in sullen silence. The royal family looked\r\nannoyed, but busied themselves with their knives and forks. A most\r\nunpleasant pause ensued, which was broken by the queen, who turning to\r\nher brother, asked him what he had seen to interest him since his\r\narrival in Paris.\r\n\r\n\"You well know,\" said he, \"that Paris abounds in interesting\r\ninstitutions. Yesterday I was filled with enthusiasm with what I saw in\r\nthe course of my morning ramble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whither did you go, count?\" asked Louis, appeased and flattered by the\r\nemperor's words.\r\n\r\n\"To the Invalides; and I confess to you that the sight of this noble\r\nasylum filled me with as much envy as admiration. I have nothing in\r\nVienna that will bear comparison with this magnificent offering of\r\nFrance to her valiant defenders. You must feel your heart stir with\r\npride whenever you visit those crippled heroes, sire.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have never visited the Invalides,\" said the king, coloring.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" cried Joseph, raising his hands in astonishment, \"the King of\r\nFrance has never visited the men who have suffered in his behalf! Sire,\r\nif you have neglected this sacred duty, you should hasten to repair the\r\nomission.\"\r\n\r\n\"What else did you see?\" asked the queen, striving to cover the king's\r\ndispleasure, and the contemptuous by-play of the Count de Provence.\r\n\r\n\"I visited the Foundling Hospital. To you, Antoinette, this hospital\r\nmust possess especial interest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. I subscribe yearly to it from my private purse,\" said the\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\n\"But surely you sometimes visit the pious sisters upon whom devolves the\r\nreal burden of this charity, to reward them by your sympathy for their\r\ndisinterested labors?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I have never been there,\" replied the queen, confused. \"It is not\r\nallowed to the Queens of France to visit public benevolent\r\ninstitutions.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet it is allowable for them to attend public balls at the\r\nopera-house!\"\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette blushed and looked displeased. This sally of the\r\nemperor was followed by another blank pause, which finally was broken by\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"I also visited another noble institution,\" continued he, \"that of the\r\ndeaf mutes. The Abbe de l'Epee deserves the homage of the world for this\r\nmonument of individual charity; for I have been told that his\r\ninstitution has never yet received assistance from the crown. My dear\r\nsister, I venture to ask alms of you for his unfortunate proteges. With\r\nwhat strength of love has he explored the dark recesses of their minds,\r\nto bear within the light of intelligence and cultivation! Think how he\r\nhas rescued them from a joyless stupor, to place them by the side of\r\nthinking, reasoning and happy human beings! As soon as I return to\r\nVienna, I shall found an institution for the deaf and dumb; I have\r\nalready arranged with the abbe to impart his system to a person who\r\nshall be sent to conduct the asylum I propose to endow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am happy to think that you meet with so many things in France worthy\r\nof your approval, count,\" remarked the king.\r\n\r\n\"Paris, sire,\" said Joseph, \"is rich in treasures of whose existence you\r\nare scarcely aware.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are these treasures, then? Enlighten me, count.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are the magnificent works of art, sire, which are lying like\r\nrubbish in your royal store-houses in Paris. Luckily, as I have been\r\ntold, etiquette requires that the pictures in your palaces should, from\r\ntime to time, be exchanged, and thus these masterpieces are sometimes\r\nbrought to view. In this matter, I acknowledge that etiquette is\r\nwisdom.\" [Footnote: The emperor's words. Campan, vol. i., p. 178]\r\n\r\n\"Etiquette,\" replied Louis, \"is often the only defence which kings can\r\nplace between themselves and importunate wisdom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wisdom is so hard to find that I should think it impossible for her to\r\nbe importunate,\" returned Joseph. \"I met with her yesterday, however, in\r\nanother one of your noble institutions--I mean the military school. I\r\nspent three hours there, and I envy you the privilege of visiting it as\r\noften as you feel disposed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your envy is quite inappropriate,\" replied Louis, sharply, \"for I have\r\nnever visited the institute at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\" cried the emperor, warmly. \"You are unacquainted with all\r\nthat is noblest and greatest in your own capital, sire! It is your duty\r\nas a king to know every thing that concerns the welfare of your\r\nsubjects, not only here in Paris, but throughout all France.\" [Footnote:\r\nThe emperor's words. Campan, vol. i., p. 79.]\r\n\r\n\"I disagree with you, and I am of opinion that wisdom is often\r\nexceedingly offensive,\" replied the king, frowning, as with a stiff bow,\r\nhe rose from the table.\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette looked anxiously at Joseph to see the effects of her\r\nhusband's impoliteness; but the emperor looked perfectly unconscious,\r\nand began to discuss the subject of painting with the Count d'Artois.\r\n\r\nThe queen retired to her cabinet, heartily rejoicing that the diner en\r\nfamille had come to an end: and almost ready to order that the royal\r\nmeals should be served in the state dining-room, and the people of Paris\r\ninvited to resume their old custom of coming to stare at the royal\r\nfamily!\r\n\r\nShe sat down to her escritoire, to work with her treasurer and private\r\nsecretary; that is, to sign all the papers that he placed before her for\r\nthat purpose.\r\n\r\nThe door opened and the emperor entered the room. The queen would have\r\nrisen, but he prevented her, and begged that he might not feel himself\r\nto be an intruder.\r\n\r\n\"I came, dear sister,\" said he, \"to ask you to accompany me to the\r\ntheatre to-night. Meanwhile it will give me great pleasure to see you\r\nusefully employed.\"\r\n\r\nSo the queen went on signing papers, not one of which she examined. The\r\nemperor watched her for a time in astonished silence; finally he came up\r\nto the escritoire.\r\n\r\n\"Sister,\" said he, \"I think it very strange that you put your name to so\r\nmany documents without ever looking at their contents.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why strange, brother?\" asked the queen, opening her large eyes in\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\n\"Because it is a culpable omission, Antoinette. You should not so\r\nlightly throw away your royal signature. The name of a sovereign should\r\nnever be signed without deliberation; much less blindly, as you are\r\nsigning yours at present.\" [Footnote: The emperor's own words.]\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette colored with vexation at this reproof in presence of\r\none of her own subjects. \"Brother,\" replied she hastily, \"I admire the\r\nfacility with which you generalize on the subject of other people's\r\nderelictions. Unhappily, your homilies are sometimes misapplied. My\r\nsecretary, Monsieur d'Augeard, has my full confidence; and these papers\r\nare merely the quarterly accounts of my household expenditures. They\r\nhave already been approved by the auditor, and you perceive that I risk\r\nnothing by affixing my signature.\"\r\n\r\n\"I perceive further,\" replied Joseph, smiling, \"that you are of one mind\r\nwith your husband, and find wisdom sometimes very offensive. Forgive me\r\nif in my over-anxiety I have hurt you, dear sister. Let us be friends;\r\nfor indeed, my poor Antoinette, you are sorely in need of friends at\r\nthis court.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen dismissed her secretary, and then came forward and took her\r\nbrother's hand. \"You have discovered then,\" said she, \"that I am\r\nsurrounded by enemies?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have indeed; and I tremble for your safety. Your foes are powerful,\r\nand you--you are not sufficiently cautious, Antoinette.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it in me that they find to blame!\" exclaimed she, her beautiful\r\neyes filling with tears.\r\n\r\n\"Some other day, we must talk of this together. I see that you are\r\nthreatened; but as yet, I neither understand the cause of your danger\r\nnor its remedy. As soon as I shall have unravelled the mystery of your\r\nposition, I will seek an interview with you; and then, dear sister, we\r\nmust forget that we are sovereigns, and remember but one thing--the ties\r\nthat have bound us together since first we loved each ether as children\r\nof one father and mother.\"\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette laid her head upon her brother's bosom and wept. \"Oh,\r\nthat we were children again in the gardens of Schonbrunn!\" sobbed she;\r\n\"for there at least we were innocent and happy!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXIX.\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU.\r\n\r\nBefore the door of a small, mean house in the village of Montmorency,\r\nstood a hackney-coach from which a man, plainly dressed, but\r\ndistinguished in appearance, had just alighted. He was contemplated with\r\nsharp scrutiny by a woman, who, with arms a-kimbo, blocked up the door\r\nof the cottage.\r\n\r\n\"Does Monsieur Rousseau live here?\" asked the stranger, touching his\r\nhat.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my husband lives here,\" said the woman, sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you are then Therese Levasseur, the companion of the great\r\nphilosopher?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am; and the Lord knows that I lead a pitiful life with the\r\nphilosopher.\"\r\n\r\n\"You complain, madame, and yet you are the chosen friend of a great\r\nman!\"\r\n\r\n\"People do not live on greatness, sir, nor on goodness either. Jean\r\nJacques is too good to be of any use in this world. He gives away every\r\nthing he has, and leaves nothing for himself and me.\"\r\n\r\nThe stranger grew sad as he looked at this great, strapping woman, whose\r\nred face was the very representative of coarseness and meanness.\r\n\r\n\"Be so good as to conduct me to Monsieur Rousseau's presence, madame,\"\r\nsaid he, in rather a commanding tone.\r\n\r\n\"I shall do no such thing,\" cried Therese Levasseur, in a loud, rough\r\nvoice. \"People who visit in hackney-coaches should not take airs.\r\nMonsieur Rousseau is not to be seen by everybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"A curious doctrine that, to be propounded before a philosopher's door!\"\r\nsaid the stranger, laughing. \"But pray, madame, excuse me and my\r\nhackney-coach, and allow me to pass.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall first tell your business. Do you bring music to copy?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, madame, I come merely to visit monsieur.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you can go as you came!\" exclaimed the virago. \"My husband is not\r\na wild animal on exhibition, and I am not going to let in every idle\r\nstranger that interferes with his work and cuts off my bread. God knows\r\nhe gives me little enough, without lessening the pittance by wasting his\r\ntime talking to you or the like of you.\"\r\n\r\nThe stranger put his hand in his pocket, and, drawing it out again, laid\r\nsomething in the palm of Therese's broad, dirty hand. He repeated his\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\nShe looked at the gold, and her avaricious face brightened.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" said she, contemplating it with a greedy smile, \"you shall\r\nsee Jean Jacques. But first you must promise not to tell him of the\r\nlouis d'or. He would growl and wish me to give it back. He is such a\r\nfool! He would rather starve than let his friends assist him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be at ease--I shall not say a word to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, sir, go in and mount the stairs, but take care not to stumble,\r\nfor the railing is down. Knock at the door above, and there you will\r\nfind Jean Jacques. While you talk to him I will go out and spend this\r\nmoney all for his comfort. Let me see--he needs a pair of shoes and a\r\ncravat--and--well,\" continued she, nodding her head, \"farewell, don't\r\nbreak your neck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" muttered she, as she went back to the street, \"he wants shoes and\r\ncravats, and coats, too, for that matter, but I am not the fool to waste\r\nmy money upon him. I shall spend it on myself for a new neckerchief; and\r\nif there is any thing left, I shall treat myself to a couple of bottles\r\nof wine and some fish.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Therese stalked through the streets to spend her money, the\r\nstranger had obtained entrance into the little dark room where sat Jean\r\nJacques Rousseau.\r\n\r\nIt was close and mouldy like the rest of the house, and a few straw\r\nchairs with one deal table was the only furniture there. On the wall\r\nhung several bird-cages, whose inmates were twittering and warbling one\r\nto another. Before the small window, which looked out upon a noble\r\nwalnut-tree, stood several glass globes, in which various worms and\r\nfishes were leading an uneasy existence.\r\n\r\nRousseau himself was seated at the table writing. He wore a coat of\r\ncoarse gray cloth, like that of a laborer, the collar of his rough linen\r\nshirt was turned down over a bright cotton scarf, which was carelessly\r\ntied around his neck. His face was pale, sad, and weary; and his scant\r\ngray hairs, as well as the deep wrinkles upon his forehead, were the\r\nscroll whereon time had written sixty years of strife and struggle with\r\nlife. Imagination, however, still looked out from the depths of his dark\r\neyes, and the corners of his mouth were still graceful with the\r\npencillinga of many a good-humored smile.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, air,\" said the stranger, \"that I enter unannounced. I found\r\nno one to precede me hither.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are too poor to keep a servant, sir,\" replied Rousseau, \"and I\r\npresume that my good Therese has gone out on some errand. How can I\r\nserve you!\"\r\n\r\n\"I came to visit Jean Jacques Rousseau, the poet and philosopher.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am the one, but scarcely the other two. Life has gone so roughly with\r\nme, that poetry has vanished long ago from my domicile, and men have\r\ndeceived me so often, that have fled from the world in disgust. You see,\r\nthen, that I have no claim to the title of philosopher.\"\r\n\r\n\"And thus speaks Jean Jacques Rousseau, who once taught that mankind\r\nwere naturally good?\"\r\n\r\n\"I still believe in my own teachings, sir,\" cried Rousseau warmly. \"Man\r\nis the vinculum that connects the Creator with His creation, and light\r\nfrom heaven illumes his birth and infancy. But the world, sir, is evil,\r\nand is swayed by two demons--selfishness and falsehood. [Footnote: This\r\nis not very philosophical. If the fraction man be intrinsically good,\r\nhow is it that the whole (the world which is made up of nothing but men)\r\nis so evil? Is there a demiurge responsible for the introduction of\r\nthese two demons?] These demons poison the heart of man, and influence\r\nhim to actions whose sole object is to advance himself and prejudice his\r\nneighbor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear that your two demons were coeval with the creation of the\r\nworld,\" said the stranger, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"No, no; they were not in Paradise. And what is Paradise but the\r\nprimitive condition of man--that happy state when in sweet harmony with\r\nNature, he lay upon the bosom of his mother earth, and inhaled health\r\nand peace from her life-giving breath? Let us return to a state of\r\nnature, and we shall find that the gates of Paradise have reopened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never! We have tasted of the tree of knowledge, and are for ever exiled\r\nfrom Eden.\"\r\n\r\n\"Woe to us all, if what you say is true; for then the world is but a\r\nvale of misery, and the wise man has but one resource--\r\nself-destruction! But pardon me, I have not offered you a chair.\"\r\n\r\nThe stranger accepted a seat, and glanced at the heaps of papers that\r\ncovered the rickety old table.\r\n\r\n\"You were writing?\" asked he. \"Are we soon to receive another great work\r\nfrom Rousseau's hands?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" replied Rousseau, sadly, \"I am too unhappy to write.\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely this is writing,\" and the stranger pointed to the papers\r\naround.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, but I copy music, and God knows that in the notes I write,\r\nthere is little or no thought. I have written books that I might give\r\noccasion to the French to think, but they have never profited by the\r\nopportunity. They are more complaisant now that I copy music. I give\r\nthem a chance to sing, and they sing.\" [Footnote: This is Rousseau's own\r\nlanguage. Ramshorn, p. 140.]\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that there is great discord in their music, sir. You who\r\nare as great a musician as a philosopher, can tell me whether I judge\r\ncorrectly.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" replied Rousseau. \"The dissonance increases with every\r\nhour. The voice which you hear is that of the people, and the day will\r\ncome when, claiming their rights, they will rend the air with a song of\r\nsuch hatred and revenge as the world has never heard before.\"\r\n\r\n\"But who denies their rights to the people?\"\r\n\r\n\"The property-holders, the priests, the nobles, and the king.\"\r\n\r\n\"The king! what has he done?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is the grandson of that Louis XV., whose life of infamy is a foul\r\nblot upon the fame of France; and nothing can ever wash away the\r\ndisgrace save an ocean of royal blood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Terrible!\" exclaimed the visitor, with a shudder. \"Are you a prophet,\r\nthat you allow yourself such anticipations of evil?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, I predict what is to come, from my knowledge of that which has\r\ngone by.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\nRousseau slowly shook his head. \"Fate has threatened this unhappy king\r\nfrom the day of his birth. Warning after warning has been sent and\r\ndisregarded. Truly, the man was a wise one who said, 'Whom the gods\r\ndestroy, they first blind!'\"\r\n\r\n\"I implore you, speak further. What evil omens have you seen that lead\r\nyou to apprehend misfortune to Louis XVI.?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you never heard of them? They are generally known.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed, I beseech you, enlighten me, for I have good reason for my\r\ncuriosity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Louis was not born like his predecessors, and it is generally believed\r\nthat he will not die a natural death. Not a single member of the royal\r\nfamily was present at his birth. When, overtaken by the pangs of\r\nchildbirth, his mother was accidentally alone in the palace of\r\nVersailles; and the heir of France, upon his entrance into life, was\r\nreceived by some insignificant stranger. The courier who was sent to\r\nannounce his birth fell from his horse and was killed on the spot. The\r\nAbbe de Saujon, who was called in to christen the infant, was struck by\r\napoplexy while entering the chapel door, and his arm and tongue were\r\nparalyzed. [Footnote: \"Memoires de Madame de Creque,\" vol. iii., p.\r\n179.] From hundreds of healthy women the physician of the dauphiness\r\nchose three nurses for the prince. At the end of a week two of them were\r\ndead, and the third one, Madame Guillotine, after nursing him for six\r\nweeks, was carried of by small-pox. Even the frivolous grandfather was\r\nterrified by such an accumulation of evil omens, and he was heard to\r\nregret that he had given to his grandson the title of Duke de Berry,\r\n'For,' said he the 'name has always brought ill-luck to its\r\npossessors.'\" [Footnote: Creque, vol. iii., p. 180.]\r\n\r\n\"But the king has long since outlived the name, and has triumphed over\r\nall the uncomfortable circumstances attending his birth, for he is now\r\nKing of France.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you know what he said when the crown was placed upon his head?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I have never heard.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was crowned at Rheims. When the hand of the archbishop was withdrawn\r\nfrom the crown, the king moaned, and turning deadly pale, murmured, 'Oh,\r\nhow it pains me!' [Footnote: Campan, vol. i., p. 115.] Once before him,\r\na King of France had made the same exclamation, and that king was Henry\r\nIII.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange!\" said the visitor. \"All this seems very absurd, and yet it\r\nfills me with horror. Have you any thing more of the same sort to point\r\nout?\"\r\n\r\n\"Remember all that occurred when the dauphin was married to the\r\nArchduchess Marie Antoinette. When she put her foot upon French ground,\r\na tent had been erected, according to custom, where she was to lay aside\r\nher clothing and be attired in garments of French manufacture. The walls\r\nof the tent were hung with costly Gobelin tapestry, all of which\r\nrepresented scenes of bloodshed. On one side was the massacre of the\r\ninnocents, on the other the execution of the Maccabees. The archduchess\r\nherself was horror-stricken at the omen. On that night, two of the\r\nladies in waiting, who had assisted the queen in her toilet, died\r\nsuddenly. Think of the terrible storm that raged on the dauphin's\r\nwedding night; and of the dreadful accident which accompanied his\r\nentrance into Paris; and then tell me whether death is not around,\r\nperchance before this unhappy king?\"\r\n\r\n\"But to what end are these omens, since they cannot help us to avert\r\nevil?\"\r\n\r\n\"To what end?\" asked Rousseau, as with a smile he contemplated the\r\nagitated countenance of his guest. \"To this end--that the emperor Joseph\r\nmay warn his brother and sister of the fate which threatens, and which\r\nwill surely engulf them, if they do not heed the signs of the coming\r\ntempest.\"\r\n\r\n\"How, Rousseau! you know me?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I had not known you, sire, I would not have spoken so freely of the\r\nking. I saw you in Paris at the theatre; and I am rejoiced to be able to\r\nspeak to your majesty as man to man, and friend to friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let me be as frank as my friend has been to me,\" said Joseph\r\nextending his hand. \"You are not situated as becomes a man of your\r\ngenius and fame. What can I do to better your condition?\"\r\n\r\n\"Better my condition?\" repeated Rousseau absently. \"Nothing. I am an old\r\nman whose every illusion has fled. My only wants are a ray of sunshine\r\nto warm my old limbs, and a crust of bread to appease my hunger.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment a shrill voice was heard without: \"Put down the money and\r\nI will fetch the music, for we are sadly pressed for every thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Heaven!\" exclaimed Rousseau, anxiously. \"I am not ready, and I had\r\npromised the music to Therese for this very hour. How shall I excuse\r\nmyself?\" Here the unhappy philosopher turned to the emperor. \"Sire, you\r\nasked what you could do for me--I implore you leave this room before\r\nTherese enters it. She will be justly displeased if she finds you here;\r\nand when my dear good Therese is angry, she speaks so loud that my\r\nnerves are discomposed for hours afterward. Here, sire, through this\r\nother door. It leads to my bedroom, and thence by a staircase to the\r\nstreet.\"\r\n\r\nTrembling with excitement, Rousseau hurried the emperor into the next\r\nroom. The latter waved his hand, and the door closed upon him. As he\r\nreached the street Joseph heard the sharp, discordant tones of Therese\r\nLevasseur's voice, heaping abuse upon the head of her philosopher,\r\nbecause he had not completed his task, and they would not have a sou\r\nwherewith to buy dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXX.\r\n\r\nTHE PARTING.\r\n\r\nThe visit of the emperor was drawing to a close. He had tasted to its\r\nutmost of the enjoyments of the peerless city. He had become acquainted\r\nwith its great national institutions, its industrial resources, its\r\ntreasures of art and of science. The Parisians were enthusiastic in his\r\npraise; from the nobleman to the artisan, every man had something to say\r\nin favor of the gracious and affable brother of the queen. Even the\r\nfish-wives, those formidable dames de la haile, had walked in procession\r\nto pay their respects, and present him a bouquet of gigantic\r\nproportions. [Footnote: On this occasion Madame Trigodin, one of the\r\nmost prominent of the poissurdes, made an address on behalf of the\r\nsisterhood. Hubner, i., p. 151.]\r\n\r\nThe emperor was popular everywhere except at court. His candor was\r\nunacceptable, and his occasional sarcasms had stung the pride of the\r\nroyal family. The king never pardoned him the unpalatable advice he had\r\nbestowed relative to the hospitals, the Invalides, and the military\r\nschools. The queen, too, was irritated to see that whereas her brother\r\nmight have expressed his disapprobation of her acts in private, he never\r\nfailed to do so in presence of the court. The consequence was, that,\r\nlike the king and the rest of the royal family, Marie Antoinette was\r\nrelieved when this long-wished-for visit of the emperor was over. This\r\ndid not prevent her from clinging to his neck, and shedding abundant\r\ntears as she felt his warm and loving embrace.\r\n\r\nThe emperor drew her close to his heart, whispering meanwhile, \"Remember\r\nthat we must see each other in private. Send some one to me to conduct\r\nme to the room in the palace which you call your 'asylum.'\"\r\n\r\n\"How!\" said the queen with surprise, \"you have heard of my asylum? Who\r\ntold you of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, Antoinette, you will awaken the king's suspicion, for all eyes\r\nare upon us! Will you admit me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I will send Louis to conduct you this afternoon.\" And withdrawing\r\nherself from her brother's arms, the queen and the royal family took\r\nleave of Count Falkenstein.\r\n\r\nHis carriages and suite had all left Paris, and Joseph, too, was\r\nsupposed to have gone long before the hour when he was conducted to the\r\nqueen's \"asylum\" by her faithful servant Louis. This \"asylum\" was in an\r\nobscure corner of the Tuileries, and to reach it the emperor was\r\nintroduced into the palace by a side door. He was led through dark\r\npassages and up narrow staircases until they reached a small door that\r\nLouis opened with a key which he took from his pocket. He clapped his\r\nhand three times, and the signal being answered, he made a profound\r\ninclination to the emperor.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty can enter. The queen is there.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph found himself in a small, simple apartment, of which the\r\nfurniture was of white wood covered with chintz. On the wall was a\r\nhanging etagere with books; opposite, an open harpsichord, and in the\r\nrecess of the window, a table covered with papers. The emperor hastily\r\nsurveyed this room, and no one coming forward, he passed into another.\r\n\r\nHere he found his sister, no longer the magnificent queen whose rich\r\ntoilets were as proverbial as her beauty; but a lovely, unpretending\r\nwoman, without rouge, without jewels, clad in a dress of India muslin,\r\nwhich was confined at the waist by a simple sash of pale lilac ribbon.\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette came forward with both hands outstretched. \"I am\r\ndressed as is my custom,\" said she, \"when the few friends I possess come\r\nto visit me here--here in my asylum, where sometimes I am able to forget\r\nthat I am Queen of France.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have no right ever to forget it, Antoinette, and it was expressly\r\nto remind you of this that I asked for a private interview with my\r\nsister.\"\r\n\r\n\"You wished to see this asylum of which you had heard, did you not?\"\r\nasked the queen with a shade of bitterness. \"I have been calumniated to\r\nyou, as I have been to the king and to the French people. I know how my\r\nenemies are trying to make my subjects hate me! I know that about these\r\nvery rooms, lewd songs are sung on the Pont-Neuf which make the Count de\r\nProvence hold his sides with laughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Antoinette, I have heard these things, and I came hither expressly\r\nto visit this 'asylum.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Joseph, it is before you. The room through which you passed, and\r\nthis one, form my suite. The door yonder leads to the apartments of the\r\nPrincess de Lamballe, and I have never opened it to enter my retreat\r\nexcept in her company.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had never the right to enter it at all. A retreat of this kind is\r\nimproper for you; and woe to you, Antoinette, if ever another man beside\r\nmyself should cross its threshold! It would give a coloring of truth to\r\nthe evil reports of your powerful enemies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gracious God of Heaven!\" cried the queen, pale with horror, \"what do\r\nthey say of me?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would avail you nothing to repeat their calumnies, poor child. I\r\nhave come hither to warn you that some dark cloud hangs over the destiny\r\nof France. You must seek means to disperse it, or it will burst and\r\ndestroy both you and your husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have already felt a presentiment of evil, dear brother, and for that\r\nvery reason I come to these little simple rooms that I may for a few\r\nhours forget the destiny that awaits me, the court which hates and\r\nvilifies me, and in short--my supremest, my greatest sorrow--the\r\nindifference of my husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear sister, you are wrong. You should never have sought to forget\r\nthese things. You have too lightly broken down the barriers which\r\netiquette, hundreds of years ago, had built around the Queens of\r\nFrance.\"\r\n\r\n\"This from YOU, Joseph, you who despise all etiquette!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, Antoinette, I am a man, and that justifies me in many an\r\nindiscretion. I have a right to attend an opera-ball unmasked, but you\r\nhave not.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had the king's permission, and was attended by my ladies of honor,\r\nand the princes of the royal family.\"\r\n\r\n\"An emperor may ride in a hackney-coach or walk, if the whim strike him,\r\nbut not a queen, Antoinette. \"\r\n\r\n\"That was an accident, Joseph. I was returning from a ball with the\r\nDuchess de Duras, when our carriage broke, and Louis was obliged to seek\r\na hackney-coach or we would have returned to the palace on foot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let it pass, then. An emperor or a king, were he very young, might\r\nindulge himself in a game of blind man's buff without impropriety; but\r\nwhen a queen ventures to do as much, she loses her dignity.\r\nNevertheless, you have been known to romp with the other ladies of the\r\ncourt, when your husband had gone to his room and was sound asleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"But who ever went to bed as early as the king?\" said Marie Antoinette\r\ndeprecatingly.\r\n\r\n\"Does he go to bed too early, Antoinette? Then it is strange that on one\r\nevening when you were waiting for him to retire so that you and your\r\nladies might visit the Duchess de Duras, you should have advanced the\r\nclock by half an hour, and sent your husband to bed at half-past ten,\r\nwhen of course he found no one in his apartments to wait upon him.\r\n[Footnote: Campan. 129.] All Paris has laughed at this mischievous prank\r\nof the queen. Can you deny this, my thoughtless sister?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never tell an untruth, Joseph; but I confess that I am astounded to\r\nsee with what police-like dexterity you have ferreted out every little\r\noccurrence of my private life;.\"\r\n\r\n\"A queen has no private life. She is doomed to live in public, and woe\r\nto her if she cannot account to the world for every hour of her\r\nexistence! If she undertake to have secrets, her very lackeys\r\nmisrepresent her innocence and make it crime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Heaven, Joseph!\" cried the queen, \"you talk as if I were a\r\ncriminal before my accusers.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a criminal, my poor young sister. Public opinion has accused\r\nyou; and accusation there is synonymous with guilt. But I, who give you\r\nso much pain, come as your friend and brother, speaking hard truths to\r\nyou, dearest, by virtue of the tie which binds us to our mother. In the\r\nname of that incomparable mother, I implore you to be discreet, and to\r\ngive no cause to your enemies for misconstruction of your youthful\r\nfollies. Take up the load of your royalty with fortitude; and, when it\r\nweighs heavily upon your poor young heart, remember that you were not\r\nmade a queen to pursue your own happiness, but to strive for that of\r\nyour subjects, whose hearts are still with you in spite of all that your\r\nenemies have done or said. Give up all egotism, Antoinette--set aside\r\nyour personal hopes; live for the good of the French nation; and one of\r\nthese days you will believe with me, that we may be happy without\r\nindividual happiness.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen shook her head, and tears rolled down her cheeks. \"No, no,\r\ndear Joseph, a woman cannot be happy when she is unloved. My heart is\r\nsick with solitude, brother. I love my husband and he does not return my\r\nlove. If I am frivolous, it is because I am unhappy. Believe me when I\r\ntell you that all would be well if the king would but love me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, Antoinette, all shall be well,\" said a voice behind them; and,\r\nstarting with a cry of surprise and shame, the queen beheld the king.\r\n\r\n\"I have heard all,\" said Louis, closing the door and advancing toward\r\nJoseph. With a bright, affectionate smile, he held out his hand, saying\r\nas he did, \"Pardon me, my brother, if I am here without your consent,\r\nand let me have a share in this sacred and happy hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brother!\" repeated Joseph, sternly. \"You say that you have overheard\r\nus. If so, you know that my sister is solitary and unhappy. Since you\r\nhave no love for her, you are no brother to me; for she, poor child, is\r\nthe tie that unites us! Look at her, sire; look at her sweet, innocent,\r\ntear-stricken face! What has she done that you should thrust her from\r\nyour heart, and doom her to confront, alone, the sneers and hatred of\r\nyour cruel relatives? She is pure, and her heart is without a stain. I\r\ntell you so--I, who in unspeakable anxiety have watched her through\r\nhired spies. Had I found her guilty I would have been the first to\r\ncondemn her; but Antoinette is good, pure, virtuous, and she has but one\r\ndefect--want of thought. It was your duty to guide her, for you received\r\nher from her mother's hands a child--a young, harmless, unsuspecting\r\nchild. What has she ever done that you should refuse her your love?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ask, rather, what have I done, that my relatives should have kept us so\r\nfar asunder?\" replied Louis, with emotion. \"Ask those who have poisoned\r\nmy ears with calumnies of my wife, why they should have sought to deny\r\nme the only compensation which life can offer to my royal station--the\r\ninestimable blessing of loving and being loved. But away with gloomy\r\nretrospection! I shall say but one word more of the past. Your majesty\r\nhas been watched, and your visit here discovered. I was told that you\r\nwere seeking to identify the queen with her mother's empire--using your\r\ninfluence to make her forget France, and plot dishonor to her husband's\r\ncrown. I resolved to prove the truth or falsehood of these accusations\r\nmyself. I thank Heaven that I did so; for from this hour I shall honor\r\nand regard you as a brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall reciprocate, sire, if you will promise to be kind to my\r\nsister?\"\r\n\r\nThe king looked at Marie Antoinette, who, seated on the sofa whence her\r\nbrother had risen, was weeping bitterly. Louis went toward her, and,\r\ntaking both her hands in his, pressed them passionately to his lips.\r\n\"Antoinette,\" said he, tenderly, \"you say that I do not love you. You\r\nhave not then read my heart, which, filled to bursting with love for my\r\nbeautiful wife, dared not ask for response, because I had been told that\r\nyou--you--but no--I will not pain you with repetition of the calumny.\r\nEnough that I am blessed with your love, and may at last be permitted to\r\npour out the torrent of mine! Antoinette, will you be my wife?\"\r\n\r\nHe held open his arms, and looked--as lovers alone can look. The queen\r\nwell knew the meaning of that glance, and, with a cry of joy, she rose\r\nand was pressed to his heart. He held her for some moments there, and\r\nthen, for the first time in their lives, the lips of husband and wife\r\nmet in one long, burning kiss of love.\r\n\r\n\"My beloved, my own,\" whispered Louis. \"Mine forever--nothing on earth\r\nshall part us now.\"\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette was speechless with happiness. She leaned her head upon\r\nher husband's breast and wept for joy, while he fondly stroked and\r\nkissed tier shining hair, and left the trace of a tear with every kiss.\r\n\r\nPresently he turned an imploring look upon the emperor, who stood by,\r\ncontemplating the lovers with an ecstasy to which he had long been a\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\n\"My brother,\" said Louis, \"for I may call you so now--seven years ago,\r\nour hands were joined together by the priest; but, the policy that would\r\nhave wounded Austria through me, has kept us asunder. This is our\r\nwedding-day, this is the union of love with love. Be you the priest to\r\nbless the rites that make us one till death.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor came forward, and, solemnly laying his hands upon the heads\r\nof the king and queen, spoke in broken accents \"God bless you, beloved\r\nbrother and sister--God give you grace to be true to each other through\r\ngood and evil report. Be gentle and indulgent one toward the other,\r\nthat, from this day forward, your two hearts may become as one!\r\nFarewell! I shall take with me to Austria the joyful news of your\r\nhappiness. Oh, how Maria Theresa will rejoice to know it, and how often\r\nwill the thought of this day brighten my own desolate hearth at Vienna!\r\nFarewell!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXXI.\r\n\r\nDEATH OF THE ELECTOR OF BAVARIA.\r\n\r\nA large and brilliant assemblage thronged the state apartments of the\r\nimperial palace at Vienna. The aristocracy not only of the capital, but\r\nof all Austria, had gathered there to congratulate the emperor upon his\r\nsafe return.\r\n\r\nIt was the first of January, 1778, and as New Year's day was the only\r\nfestival which Joseph's new ordinance allowed, the court took occasion\r\nto celebrate it with all the pomp of embroidery, orders, stars, and\r\nblazing jewels.\r\n\r\nThe empress had never thrown off her mourning, so that her dark gray\r\ndress with its long train was in striking contrast with the rich,\r\nelegant costumes, the flowers and diamonds of the other ladies present.\r\nStill, there was something in this tall, noble form which distinguished\r\nit above the rest, and spoke to all beholders of the sovereign will that\r\nresided there. Maria Theresa was still the majestic empress--but she was\r\nnow an old woman.\r\n\r\nTime as well as disease had marred her beauty, and the cares, anxieties,\r\nand afflictions of sixty years had written their inexorable record upon\r\nthe tablet of her once fair brow. Not only these, but accident also had\r\ndestroyed the last lingering traces of Maria Theresa's youthful\r\ncomeliness. Returning from Presburg, she had been thrown from her\r\ncarriage, and dashed with such force against the stones on the road,\r\nthat she had been taken up bloody, and, to all appearances, lifeless.\r\nHer face had suffered severely, and to her death she bore the deep-red\r\nscars which had been left by her wounds. Her figure, too, had lost its\r\ngrace, and was now so corpulent that she moved slowly and heavily\r\nthrough the rooms, where, in former years, she had stood by the side of\r\nher \"Francis,\" the most beautiful woman of her own or of any European\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nHer magnificent eyes, however, had defied time, they were large,\r\nflashing, expressive as ever--as quick to interpret anger, enthusiasm,\r\nor tenderness as in the days of her youth.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of which we speak, the empress was at the card-table. But\r\nthose great, glowing eyes were roving from one side of the room to the\r\nother in restless anxiety. Sometimes, for a moment, they rested upon the\r\nemperor who was standing near the table in conversation with some\r\nprovincial nobleman. The cheerful and unconcerned demeanor of her son\r\nseemed to reassure the empress, who turned to her cards, and tried to\r\nbecome interested in the game. Not far off, the archduchesses, too, were\r\nat cards, and the hum of conversation subsided almost to a whisper, that\r\nthe imperial party might not be disturbed. Gradually the empress became\r\nabsorbed in her cards, so that she was unobservant of the entrance of\r\none of the emperor's lords in waiting who whispered something in\r\nJoseph's ear, whereupon the latter left the room in haste.\r\n\r\nNot very long after the emperor returned pale and excited, and\r\napproached the card-tables. Maria Theresa, at that moment, had just\r\nrequested Count Dietrichstein to deal for her, and she was leaning back\r\nin her chair, awaiting the end of the deal.\r\n\r\nThe emperor bent over and whispered something in her ear, when she\r\nstarted, and the cards, which she was just gathering, fell from her\r\nhands. With unusual agility she rose, and taking the emperor's arm,\r\nturned away without a word of apology, and left the room.\r\n\r\nThe archduchesses had not yet perceived their mother's absence, when\r\nCount Dietrichstein, on the part of the emperor, came forward, and\r\nwhispered a few words to each one of them. Precisely as their mother had\r\ndone the princesses rose, and without apology retired together.\r\n\r\nThe company started, and whispered and wondered what could have happened\r\nto discompose the imperial family; but no one present was competent to\r\nsolve the mystery.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Maria Theresa had retired to her cabinet, where she met Prince\r\nKaunitz, furred like a polar bear, by way of protection from the\r\ntemperature of the palace, which was always many degrees below zero, as\r\nindicated by the thermometer of his thin, bloodless veins. The minister\r\nwas shaking with cold, although he had buried his face in a muff large\r\nenough to have been one of his own cubs. The empress returned his\r\ngreeting with an agitated wave of her hand, and seated herself in an\r\narm-chair at the large round table that always stood there.\r\n\r\nExhausted by the unusual haste with which she had walked as well as by\r\nthe excitement, which, in her old age, she was physically inadequate to\r\nbear, she leaned back to recover her breath. Opposite stood the emperor,\r\nwho, with a wave of his hand, motioned to Kaunitz to enter also.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa's large eyes were fixed upon him at once.\r\n\r\n\"Is it true.\" said she. \"that the Elector of Bavaria is dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty,\" said Kaunitz. \"Maximilian reigns no longer in\r\nBavaria. Here are the dispatches from our ambassador at Munich.\"\r\n\r\nHe held them out, but the empress put them back, saying:\r\n\r\n\"I am not sufficiently composed to read them. Give them to my son, and\r\nhave the goodness to communicate their contents to me verbally.\"\r\n\r\nThe face of Kaunitz grew pale, as he turned with the dispatches to the\r\nemperor. The latter at once comprehended the prince's agitation, and\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\n\"I beg of your majesty,\" said he, \"to excuse the prince, and to allow me\r\nto read to you the particulars of Maximilian's demise. His highness must\r\nbe fatigued, and, doubtless, your majesty will allow him to retire\r\nwithin the embrasure of yonder window, until I have concluded the\r\nperusal of the dispatches.\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz brightened at once as the empress gave her consent, and he\r\ngladly withdrew to the window which was far enough from the table to be\r\nout of reach of the emperor's voice.\r\n\r\nJoseph could not restrain another smile as he watched the tall, stiff\r\nform of the old prince, and saw how carefully he drew the window\r\ncurtains around him, lest a word of what was going on should reach his\r\nears.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your majesty,\" said Joseph, in a low voice, \"but you know\r\nwhat a horror Kaunitz has of death and the small-pox. As both these\r\nwords form the subject of our dispatches, I was glad to relieve the\r\nprince from the necessity of repeating their contents.\"\r\n\r\n\"That you should have remembered his weakness does honor to your heart,\r\nmy son,\" replied Maria Theresa. \"In my agitation I had forgotten it.\r\nMaximilian, then, must have died of small-pox.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did, your majesty, like his sister, my unhappy wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange!\" said Maria Theresa, thoughtfully. \"Josepha has often spoken\r\nto me of the presentiment which her brother had that he would die of the\r\nsmall-pox.\"\r\n\r\n\"It proves to us that man cannot fly from his destiny. The elector\r\nforesaw that he would die of small-pox, and took every precaution to\r\navert his fate. Nevertheless, it overtook him.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress sighed and slowly shook her head. \"Where did he take the\r\ninfection'?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"From the daughter of the marshal of his household, who lived at the\r\npalace, and took the small-pox there. Every attempt was made to conceal\r\nthe fact from the elector, and indeed he remained in total ignorance of\r\nit. One day while he was playing billiards, the marshal, who had just\r\nleft his daughter's bedside, entered the room. The elector, shuddering,\r\nlaid down his cue, and turning deathly pale, murmured these words: 'Some\r\none here has the small-pox. I feel it.' He then fell insensible on the\r\nfloor. He recovered his consciousness, but died a few days afterward.\r\n[Footnote: Wraxall, \"Memoirs of the Courts of Berlin, Vienna, etc.,\"\r\nvol. i., p. 306.] This is the substance of the dispatches. Shall I now\r\nread them?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, my son,\" said the empress, gloomily. \"Enough that the son of my\r\nenemy is dead, and his house without an heir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; he is dead,\" replied Joseph, sternly. \"The brother of my enemy--of\r\nthat wife with whom for two years I lived the martyrdom of an abhorred\r\nunion! He has gone to his sister, gone to his father, both our bitter,\r\nbitter foes. I hated Josepha for the humiliation I endured as the\r\nhusband of such a repulsive woman; but to-day I forgive her, for 'tis\r\nshe who from the grave holds out to me the rich inheritance which is the\r\nfruit of our marriage.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress raised her eyes with an expression of alarm.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed she, \"another robbery! Lies not the weight of one\r\ninjustice upon my conscience, that you would seek to burden my soul with\r\nanother! Think you that I have forgotten Poland!--No! The remembrance\r\nof our common crime will follow me to the bitter end, and it shall not\r\nbe aggravated by repetition. I am empress of Austria, and while I live,\r\nJoseph, you must restrain your ambition within the bounds of justice and\r\nprincely honor.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor bowed. \"Your majesty must confess that I have never\r\nstruggled against your imperial will. I have bowed before it, sorely\r\nthough it has humiliated me. But as there is no longer any question of\r\ndeath before us, allow me to recall Prince Kaunitz, that he may take\r\npart in our discussion.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa bowed in silence, and the emperor drew the minister from\r\nhis retreat behind the curtains.\r\n\r\n\"Come, your highness,\" whispered Joseph. \"Come and convince the empress\r\nthat Bavaria must be ours. We are about to have a struggle.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I shall come out victor,\" replied Kaunitz, as he rose and returned\r\nto the table.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa surveyed them both with looks of disapprobation and\r\napprehension. \"I see,\" said she, in a tremulous voice, \"that you are two\r\nagainst one. I do not think it honorable in Kaunitz to uphold my son\r\nagainst his sovereign. Tell me, prince, do you come hither to break your\r\nfaith, and overthrow your empress?\"\r\n\r\n\"There lives not man or woman in the world who can accuse Kaunitz of bad\r\nfaith,\" replied the prince. \"I swore years ago to dedicate myself to\r\nAustria, and I shall keep my word until your majesty releases me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that is one of your numerous threats to resign,\" said the\r\nempress, with irritation. \"If there is difference of opinion between us,\r\nI must yield, or you will not remain my minister. But be sure that to\r\nthe last day of my life I shall retain my sovereignty, nor share it with\r\nson or minister; and this conceded, we may confer together. Let the\r\nemperor sit by my side, and you, prince, be opposite to us, for I wish\r\nto look into your face that I may judge how far your tongue expresses\r\nthe convictions of your conscience. And now I desire the emperor to\r\nexplain his words, and tell me how it is that the succession of Bavaria\r\nconcerns the house of Hapsburg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Frankly, then,\" cried Joseph, with some asperity, \"I mean that our\r\ntroops must be marched into Bavaria at once; for by the extinction of\r\nthe finale line of Wittelsbach, the electorate is open to us as an\r\nimperial thief, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Austria, then, has pretensions to the electorate of Bavaria,\"\r\ninterrupted Maria Theresa, with constrained calmness.\r\n\r\nThe emperor in his turn looked at his mother with astonishment. \"Has\r\nyour majesty, then, not read the documents which were drawn up for your\r\ninspection by the court historiographer?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have seen them all,\" replied the empress, sadly. \"I have read all the\r\ndocuments by which you have sought to prove that Austria has claims upon\r\nLower Bavaria, because, in 1410, the Emperor Sigismund enfeoffed his\r\nson-in-law, Albert of Austria, with this province. I have read further\r\nthat in 1614 the Emperor Matthias gave to the archducal house the\r\nreversion of the Suabian estate of Mindelheim, which subsequently, in\r\n1706, when the Elector of Bavaria fell under the ban of the empire, was\r\nactually claimed by the Emperor of Austria. I have also learned that the\r\nUpper Palatinate, with all its counties, by the extinction of the\r\nWittelsbach dynasty, becomes an open feoff, to which the Emperor of\r\nAustria thinks that he may assert his claims.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your majesty is not convinced of the validity of my claims?\"\r\nexclaimed the emperor.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa shook her head. \"I cannot believe that we are justifies in\r\nannexing to Austria an electorate which, not being ours by indisputable\r\nright of inheritance, may be the cause of involving us in a bloody war.\"\r\n\r\n\"But which, nevertheless, is the finest province in all Germany,\" cried\r\nJoseph impatiently; \"and its acquisition the first step toward\r\nconsolidation of all the German principalities into one great empire.\r\nWhen the Palatinate, Suabia, and Lower Bavaria are ours, the Danube will\r\nflow through Austrian territory alone; the trade of the Levant becomes\r\nours; our ships cover the Black Sea, and finally Constantinople will be\r\ncompelled to open its harbor to Austrian shipping and become a mart for\r\nthe disposal of Austrian merchandise. Once possessed of Bavaria, South\r\nGermany, too, lies open to Austria, which like a magnet will draw toward\r\none centre all its petty provinces and counties. After that, we approach\r\nPrussia, and ask whether she alone will stand apart from the great\r\nfederation, or whether she has patriotism and magnanimity enough to\r\nmerge her name and nationality in ours. Oh, your majesty, I implore you\r\ndo not hesitate to pluck the golden fruit, for it is ours! Think, too,\r\nhow anxiously the Bavarians look to us for protection against the\r\npretensions of Charles Theodore, the only heir of the deceased elector.\r\n\r\n\"The people of Bavaria well know what is to be their fate if they fall\r\ninto the hands of the elector palatine. Surrounded by mistresses with\r\nswarms of natural children, his sole object in life will be to plunder\r\nhis subjects that he may enrich a progeny to whom he can lave neither\r\nname nor crown. Oh, your majesty, be generous, and rescue the Bavarians\r\nfrom a war of succession; for the elector palatine has no heir, and his\r\ndeath will be the signal for new strife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, it seems to me that the Duke of Zweibrucken [Footnote: Called in\r\nEnglish history, Duke of Deux-ponts.--Trans.] is the natural heir of\r\nCharles Theodore, and I suppose he will be found as willing to possess\r\nhis inheritance as you or I, or any other pretender, replied Maria\r\nTheresa. \"But if, as you say, the Bavarians are sighing to become\r\nAustrian subjects, it seems to me that they might have character enough\r\nto give us some indication of their predilections; for I declare to you\r\nboth that I will not imitate the treachery of Frederick. I will not\r\nbring up mouldy documents from our imperial archives to prove that I\r\nhave a right to lands which for hundreds of years have been the property\r\nof another race; nor will I, for mad ambition's sake, spill one drop of\r\nhonest Austrian blood.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so will Austria lose her birthright,\" returned Joseph angrily. \"And\r\nso shall I be doomed to idle insignificance, while history ignores the\r\nonly man who really loves Germany, and who has spirit to defy the malice\r\nof his contemporaries, and in the face of their disapproval, to do that\r\nwhich is best for Germany's welfare. Is it possible that your majesty\r\nwill put upon me this new humiliation? Do you really bid me renounce the\r\nbrightest dream of my life?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear son,\" said the empress, \"I cannot view this undertaking with\r\nyour eyes; I am old and timid, and I shudder with apprehension of the\r\ndemon that follows in the wake of ambition. I would not descend to my\r\ngrave amid the wails and curses of my people--I would not be depicted\r\nin history as an ambitious and unscrupulous sovereign. Let me go to my\r\nFranz blessed by the tears and regrets of my subjects--let me appear\r\nbefore posterity as an upright and peace-loving empress. But I have said\r\nthat I am old--so old that I mistrust my own judgment. It may be that I\r\nmistake pusillanimity for disinterestedness. Speak, Kaunitz--so far you\r\nhave been silent. What says your conscience to this claim? Is it\r\nconsistent with justice and honor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty knows that I will speak my honest convictions even though\r\nthey might be unacceptable to the ear of my sovereign,\" replied Kaunitz.\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" said the empress, disconsolately. \"You are of one mind\r\nwith the emperor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Kaunitz, \"I am. It is the duty of Austria to assert her\r\nright to an inheritance which her ancestors foresaw, hundreds of years\r\nago, would be indispensable to her future stability. Not only your\r\nmajesty's forefathers, but the force of circumstances signify to us that\r\nthe acquisition is natural and easy. It would be a great political error\r\nto overlook it; and believe me that in no science is an error so fatal\r\nto him who commits it as in the science of government. Bavaria is\r\nnecessary to Austria, and your majesty may become its ruler without so\r\nmuch as one stroke of the sword.\"\r\n\r\n\"Without a stroke of the sword!\" exclaimed Maria Theresa, impetuously.\r\n\"Does your highness suppose that such a stupendous acquisition as that,\r\nis not to provoke the opposition of our enemies?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is to oppose us?\" asked Kaunitz. \"Not France, certainly; she is too\r\nclosely our relative and ally.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not rely much upon the friendship of France,\" interrupted the\r\nempress. Marie Antoinette is mistress of the king's affections; but his\r\nministers guide his policy, and they would gladly see our friendly\r\nrelations ruptured.\"\r\n\r\n\"But France is not in a condition to oppose us,\" continued Kaunitz. \"Her\r\nfinances are disordered, and at this very moment she is equipping an\r\narmy to aid the American rebellion. We have nothing to fear from Russia,\r\nprovided we overlook her doings in Turkey, and look away while she\r\nabsorbs the little that remains of Poland. England is too far away to be\r\ninterested in the matter, and Frederick knows by dear-bought experience\r\nthat her alliance, in case of war, is perfectly worthless. Besides,\r\nGeorge has quite enough on his hands with his troubles in North America.\r\nWho, then, is to prevent us from marching to Bavaria and taking\r\npeaceable possession of our lawful inheritance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who?\" exclaimed the empress. \"Our greatest and bitterest enemy--the\r\nwicked and unprincipled parvenu who has cost me so many tears, my people\r\nso many lives, and who has robbed me of one of the fairest jewels in my\r\nimperial crown.\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz shrugged his shoulders. \"Your majesty is very magnanimous to\r\nspeak of the Margrave of Brandenburg as a dangerous foe.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if he were a dangerous foe,\" cried Joseph vehemently, \"so much the\r\nmore glory to me if I vanquish him in battle and pluck the laurels from\r\nhis bead!\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz looked at the emperor and slightly raised his finger by way of\r\nwarning. \"The King of Prussia,\" said he, \"is no longer the hero that he\r\nwas in years gone by; he dare not risk his fame by giving battle to the\r\nemperor. He rests upon his laurels, plays on the flute, writes bad\r\nverses, and listens to the adulation of his fawning philosophical\r\nfriends. Then why should he molest us in Bavaria. We have documents to\r\nprove that the heritage is ours, and if we recognize his right to\r\nBayreuth and Anspach, he will admit ours to whatever we choose to\r\nclaim.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa was unconvinced. \"You make light of Frederick, prince; but\r\nhe is as dangerous as ever, and after all I think it much safer to fear\r\nour enemies than to despise them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Frederick of Prussia is a hero, a philosopher, and a legislator,\" cried\r\nJoseph. \"Let me give him battle, your majesty, that I may win honor by\r\nvanquishing the victor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never will I give my consent to such measures, unless we are forced to\r\nadopt them in defence of right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our right here is indisputable,\" interposed Kaunitz. \"Copies of our\r\ndocuments have already been circulated throughout Germany; and I have\r\nreceived from Herr von Ritter, the commissioner of Charles Theodore, the\r\nassurance that the latter is ready to resign his pretensions in\r\nconsideration of the advantages we offer.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are these advantages?\" asked Maria Theresa.\r\n\r\n\"We offer him our provinces in the Netherlands, and the privilege of\r\nestablishing a kingdom in Burgundy,\" replied Joseph. \"We also bestow\r\nupon his multitudinous children titles, orders, and a million of\r\nflorins.\"\r\n\r\n\"And shame all virtue and decency!\" cried the empress, coloring\r\nviolently.\r\n\r\n\"The elector loves his progeny, and cares little or nothing for\r\nBavaria,\" continued Joseph. \"We shall win him over, and Bavaria will\r\ncertainly be ours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Without the shedding of one drop of blood,\" added Kaunitz, drawing from\r\nhis coat-pocket a paper which he unfolded and laid upon the table.\r\n\r\n\"Here is a map of Bavaria, your majesty,\" said Kaunitz, \"and here is\r\nthat portion of the electorate which we claim, through its cession to\r\nAlbert of Austria by the Emperor Sigismund.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must take possession of it at once,\" cried Joseph; \"at once, before\r\nany other claimant has time to interpose.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress heaved a sigh. \"Yes,\" said she, as if communing with\r\nherself, \"it all looks smooth and fair on paper. It is very easy to draw\r\nboundary lines with your finger, prince. You have traced out mountains\r\nand rivers, but you have not won the hearts of the Bavarians; and\r\nwithout their hearts it is worse than useless to occupy their country.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall win their hearts by kindness,\" exclaimed the emperor. \"True,\r\nwe take their insignificant fatherland, but we give them instead, the\r\nrich inheritance of our own nationality; and future history will record\r\nit to their honor that theirs was the initiatory step which subsequently\r\nmade one nation of all the little nationalities of Germany.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress answered with another sigh, and looked absently at the\r\noutspread map, across which Kaunitz was drawing his finger in another\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" said he, \"are the estates which the extinct house held in fief\r\nfrom the German emperor.\"\r\n\r\n\"And which I, as Emperor of Germany, have a right to reannex to my\r\nempire,\" cried Joseph.\r\n\r\n\"And here, finally,\" pursued Kaunitz, still tracing with his finger,\r\n\"here is the lordship of Mindelheim, of which the reversion was not only\r\nceded to Austria by the Emperor Matthias, but actually fell to us and\r\nwas relinquished to the Elector of Bavaria by the too great magnanimity\r\nof an Austrian sovereign. Surely, your majesty is not willing to abandon\r\nyour inheritance to the first comer?\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa's head was bent so low that it rested upon the map whereon\r\nher minister had been drawing lines of such significance to Austria.\r\nClose by, stood the emperor in breathless anxiety; while opposite sat\r\nKaunitz, impassable as ever.\r\n\r\nAgain a deep sigh betokened the anguish that was rending the honest\r\nheart of the empress; and she raised her head.\r\n\r\n\"Alas for me and my declining energies!\" said she, bitterly. \"Two\r\nagainst one, and that one a woman advanced in years! I am not convinced,\r\nbut my spirit is unequal to strife. Should we fail, we will be made to\r\nfeel the odium of our proceedings; should we triumph, I suppose that the\r\njustice of our pretensions will never be questioned. Perhaps, as the\r\nworld has never blamed Frederick for the robbery of Silesia, it may\r\nforgive us the acquisition of Bavaria. In the name of God, then, do both\r\nof you what you deem it right to do; but in mercy, take nothing that is\r\nnot ours. We shall be involved in war; I feel it, and I would so gladly\r\nhave ended my life in the calm, moon-like radiance of gentle peace.\"\r\n[Footnote: The empress's own sentiments. Wraxall, i, p. 311.]\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty shall end your life in peace and prosperity; but far in\r\nthe future be the day of your departure!\" cried Joseph, kissing the hand\r\nof the empress. \"May you live to see Austria expand into a great empire,\r\nand Germany rescued from the misrule of its legions of feeble princes!\r\nThe first impulse has been given to-day. Bavaria is rescued from its\r\nmiserable fate, and becomes an integral portion of one of the most\r\npowerful nations in Europe.\"\r\n\r\n\"May God be merciful, and bless the union!\" sighed the empress. \"I shall\r\nbe wretched until I know how it is to terminate, and day and night I\r\nshall pray to the Lord that He preserve my people from the horrors of\r\nwar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile Kaunitz and I will seek a blessing on our enterprise by\r\ntaking earthly precautions to secure its success. You, prince, will use\r\nthe quill of diplomacy, and I shall make ready to defend my right with a\r\nhundred thousand trusty Austrians to back me. To-night I march a portion\r\nof my men into Lower Bavaria.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" murmured the unhappy empress, \"there will be war and bloodshed!\"\r\n\r\n\"Before your majesty marches to Bavaria,\" said Kaunitz inclining his\r\nbead, \"her majesty, the empress, must sign the edict which shall apprise\r\nher subjects and the world of the step we meditate. I haves drawn it up,\r\nand it awaits her majesty's approbation and signature.\"\r\n\r\nThe prince then drew from his muff a paper, which he presented to the\r\nempress. Maria Theresa perused it with sorrowful eyes.\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing but a resume of our just claims to Bavaria,\" said Joseph,\r\nhastily.\r\n\r\n\"It is very easy to prove the justice of a thing on paper,\" replied\r\nMaria Theresa; \"may God grant that it prove to be so in deed as well as\r\nin word. I will do your bidding, and sign your edict, but upon your head\r\nbe all the blood that follows my act!\"\r\n\r\nShe wrote her name, and Joseph, in an outburst of triumph, shouted,\r\n\"Bavaria is ours!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXXII.\r\n\r\nA PAGE FROM HISTORY.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa's worst apprehensions were realized, and the marching of\r\nthe Austrian troops into Bavaria was the signal for war. While all the\r\npetty sovereigns of Germany clamored over the usurpation of Austria,\r\npamphlet upon pamphlet issued from the hands of Austrian jurists to\r\njustify the act. These were replied to by the advocates of every other\r\nGerman state, who proved conclusively that Austria was rapacious and\r\nunscrupulous, and had not a shadow of right to the Bavarian succession.\r\nA terrible paper war ensued, during which three hundred books were\r\nlaunched by the belligerents at each other's heads. [Footnote:\r\nSchlosser's History of the Eighteenth Century, vol. iv., p. 363.] This\r\nstrife was productive of one good result; it warmed up the frozen\r\npatriotism of all the German races. Bavarians, Hessians, Wurtembergers,\r\nand Hanoveriana, forgot their bickerings to join the outcry against\r\nAustria; and the Church, to which Joseph was such an implacable enemy,\r\nencouraged them in their resistance to the \"innovator,\" as he was called\r\nby his enemies.\r\n\r\nOf all the malcontents, the noisiest were the Bavarians. The elector\r\npalatine, whose advent all had dreaded, was greeted upon his entrance\r\ninto Munich with glowing enthusiasm; and the people forgot his\r\nextravagance and profligacy to remember that upon him devolved the\r\npreservation of their independence as a nation.\r\n\r\nBut Charles Theodore was very little edified by the sentiments which\r\nwere attributed to him by the Bavarians. He longed for nothing better\r\nthan to relieve himself of Bavaria and the weight of Austrian\r\ndispleasure, to return to the palatinate, and come into possession of\r\nthe flesh-pots that awaited his children in the form of titles, orders,\r\nand florins. He lent a willing ear to Joseph's propositions, and a few\r\ndays after his triumphant entrance into Munich, he signed a contract\r\nrelinquishing in favor of Austria two-thirds of his Bavarian\r\ninheritance. Maria Theresa, in the joy of her heart, bestowed upon him\r\nthe order of the Golden Fleece, and on January 3, 1778, entered into\r\npossession of her newly acquired territory.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in Bavaria, arose a voice which, with the fire of genuine\r\npatriotism, protested against the cowardly compliance of the elector\r\npalatine. It was that of the Duchess Clemens, of Bavaria. She hastened\r\nto give information of his pusillanimity to the next heir, the Dune of\r\nZweibrucken, and dispatched a courier to Berlin asking succor and\r\nprotection from the crown of Prussia.\r\n\r\nThe energy of this Bavarian patriot decided the fate of the Austrian\r\nclaim. The Duke of Zweibrucken protested against the cession of the\r\nsmallest portion of his future inheritance, and declared that he would\r\nnever relinquish it to any power on earth. Frederick pronounced himself\r\nready to sustain the duke, and threatened a declaration of war unless\r\nthe Austrian troops were removed. In vain Maria Theresa sought to\r\nindemnify the duke by offers of orders, florins, and titles, which had\r\nbeen so successful with Charles Theodore--in vain she offered to make\r\nhim King of Burgundy--he remained incorruptible. He coveted nothing she\r\ncould bestow, but was firm in his purpose, to preserve the integrity of\r\nBavaria, and called loudly for Frederick to come to the rescue.\r\n\r\nFrederick responded: \"He was ready to defend the rights of the elector\r\npalatine against the unjust pretensions of the court of Vienna,\"\r\n[Footnote: Dohm's Memoirs, vol. i.] and removed his troops from Upper\r\nSilesia to the confines of Bohemia and Saxony. This was the signal for\r\nthe advance of the Austrian army; and despite her repugnance to the act,\r\nMaria Theresa was compelled to suffer it. She was also forced to allow\r\nJoseph to take command in person. This time her representations and\r\nentreaties had been vain; Joseph was thirsting for military glory, and\r\nhe bounded like a war-horse to the trumpet's call. The empress felt that\r\nher hands were now powerless to restrain him, and she was so much the\r\nfeebler, that Kaunitz openly espoused the side of the ambitious emperor.\r\n\r\nWith convulsive weeping Maria Theresa saw her son assume his command,\r\nand when Joseph bade her farewell, she sank insensible from his arms to\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE EMPEROR AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Joseph was pacing the floor of his cabinet. Sometimes he\r\npaused before a window, and with absent looks surveyed the plain where\r\nhis troops were encamped, and their stacked arms glistened to the sun;\r\nthen he returned to the table where Field-Marshal Lacy was deep in plans\r\nand charts.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the silence was broken by the blast of a trumpet or the\r\nshouts of the soldiery who were arriving at headquarters.\r\n\r\n\"Lacy,\" said the emperor, after a long, dreary pause, \"put by your\r\ncharts, and give me a word of consolation.\"\r\n\r\nThe field-marshal laid aside his papers and rose from the table. \"Your\r\nmajesty had ordered me to specify upon the chart the exact spot which\r\nFrederick occupies by Welsdorf, and Prince Henry by Nienberg.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, I know,\" answered Joseph impatiently. \"But what avails their\r\nencampment to-day, when to-morrow they are sure to advance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty thinks that he will make an attack?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I doubt it. It is my opinion that he will avoid a collision.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why then should he have commenced hostilities?\" cried Joseph angrily.\r\n\"Have you forgotten that although the elector palatine is ready to\r\nrenounce Bavaria, Frederick opposes our claims in the name of Germany\r\nand of the next heir?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sire; but Frederick has spies in Vienna, who have taken care to\r\ninform him that Maria Theresa is disinclined to war. He has, therefore,\r\ndeclared against us, because he hopes that the blast of his coming will\r\nsuffice to scatter the armies of Austria to the winds.\"\r\n\r\n\"The time has gone by when the terror of his name could appal us,\" cried\r\nJoseph, proudly throwing back his head. \"I hope to convince him ere long\r\nthat I am more than willing to confront him in battle, Oh, how weary is\r\nthe inactivity to which my mother's womanish fears condemn me! Why did I\r\nheed her tears, and promise that I would not make the attack? Now I must\r\nwait, nor dare to strike a blow, while my whole soul yearns for the\r\nfight, and I long either to lead my troops to victory or perish on the\r\nfield of battle.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet, sire, it is fortunate that you have been forced to inactivity.\r\nTo us time is every thing, for Frederick's army outnumbers ours. He has\r\nseventy thousand men with him near the Elbe, and fifty thousand under\r\nPrince Henry near Nienberg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I shall oppose his hundred and twenty thousand men with twice\r\ntheir number,\" cried Joseph impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Provided we have time to assemble our men. But we must have several\r\ndays to accomplish this. At the end of a week our army will be complete\r\nin numbers, and we can then await the enemy behind our intrenchments,\r\nand the natural defences afforded us by the steep banks of the Elbe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Await--nothing but await,\" said Joseph scornfully. \"Forever condemned\r\nto delay.\"\r\n\r\n\"In war, delay is often the best strategy, sire. The great Maurice, of\r\nSaxony, has said that fighting is an expedient by which incompetent\r\ncommanders are accustomed to draw themselves out of difficult positions.\r\nWhen they are perplexed as to their next move, they are apt to stumble\r\ninto a battle. I coincide with the great captain, although I well know\r\nthat I shall incur your majesty's displeasure thereby. Our policy is to\r\nremain upon the defensive, and await an attack. Frederick has been\r\naccustomed to win his laurels by bold and rapid moves, but we have now\r\nfor us an ally who will do better service in the field against him than\r\nour expertest generalship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is that?\" asked Joseph, who was listening in no amiable mood to\r\nLacy's dissertation on strategy.\r\n\r\n\"It is old age, sire, which hourly reminds Frederick that his hand is\r\ntoo feeble to wield a sword or pluck new laurels. Frederick accompanied\r\nhis army in a close carriage; and yesterday, as he attempted to mount\r\nhis horse, he was so weak that he had to be helped into the saddle; in\r\nconsequence of which he reviewed his troops in an ill-humor, cursed the\r\nwar, and wished Austria to the devil.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this is the end of a great military chieftain,\" said Joseph sadly;\r\n\"the close of a magnificent career! May God preserve me from such a\r\nfate! Sooner would I pass from exuberant life to sudden death, than drag\r\nmy effete manhood through years of weariness to gradual and ignominious\r\nextinction!\r\n\r\n\"But,\" continued the emperor, after a pause, \"these are idle musings,\r\nLacy. Your picture of the great Frederick has made me melancholy; I\r\ncannot but hope that it is overdrawn. It cannot be that such a warrior\r\nhas grown vacillating; he will surely awake, and then the old lion will\r\nshake his mane, and his roar--\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment a horseman at full speed was seen coming toward the\r\nhouse. He stopped immediately before the window. A little behind came\r\nanother, and both dismounting, spoke several words to the soldiery\r\naround, which evidently produced a sensation.\r\n\r\n\"Lacy,\" said Joseph, \"something has happened; and from the countenances\r\nof the men, I fear that these messengers have brought evil tidings. Let\r\nus go out and see what has occurred.\"\r\n\r\nAs the emperor was about to lay his hand upon the door, it opened, and\r\none of his adjutants appeared.\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" said he, almost breathless, \"a courier has arrived from the\r\nborders of Bohemia, and he brings startling intelligence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us at once what it is,\" said the emperor.\r\n\r\n\"The King of Prussia has left the county of Glatz and has marched into\r\nBohemia.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor's face brightened instantaneously. \"That is glorious news!\"\r\ncried he.\r\n\r\n\"Glorious news, sire?\" exclaimed the astounded adjutant. \"The courier\r\nwho brings the intelligence has no words strong enough to depict the\r\nterror of the inhabitants. They were gathering their effects and flying\r\nto the interior, while the Prussian troops occupied the villages without\r\nopposition.\"\r\n\r\n\"The count is correct,\" said Lacy, who just then reentered the room. \"I\r\nhave spoken with the man who brought the tidings. He is the mayor of his\r\nvillage, and he fled as the staff of the king entered the place.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must speak with him myself,\" cried Joseph quickly; and the adjutant\r\nopening the door, the villager was introduced into the room.\r\n\r\n\"Did you see the King of Prussia?\" asked the emperor.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire, I saw him,\" replied the man, gloomily. \"I heard him order\r\nhis men to forage their horses from our barns, and to strip our gardens\r\nof their fruit and vegetables. I heard him give orders to spare nothing;\r\nfor, said he, 'the people must be made to feel that the enemy is in\r\ntheir midst.'\" [Footnote: Frederick's own words. Dohm's Memoirs, vol.\r\ni., p. 130.]\r\n\r\n\"I shall remember the king's words,\" said Joseph, while his eyes flashed\r\nwith anger. \"How did he look?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like the devil in the likeness of an old man,\" said the peasant. \"His\r\nvoice is as soft as that of a bridegroom; but his words are the words of\r\na hangman, and his eyes dart fire like those of an evil spirit. Even his\r\nown men have nothing good to say of him. His generals call him a selfish\r\nold man, who wants to do every thing, and knows nothing. He has not even\r\nappointed a general staff, and has no one to attend to the wants of his\r\narmy.\" [Footnote: Historical. See Dohm, vol. i., p. 183.]\r\n\r\n\"Further, further!\" cried Joseph, as the man paused.\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing further to tell, sire. As the king and his people left\r\nmy house, it was growing dark, so I slipped out. The curates were in the\r\nchurches with the women and children, and we men ran to the next\r\nvillage, where the people gave us horses; and I have come to entreat the\r\nemperor not to let the King of Prussia take us, as he did Silesia.\"\r\n\r\n\"I give you my word that you shall not be given over to Prussia. Remain\r\ntrue to your country, and oppose the enemy whenever and wherever you\r\ncan. Go back to your village, greet your friends for me, and promise\r\nthem my protection. Count, be so good as to see that these men get some\r\nrefreshment before they start.\"\r\n\r\nThe adjutant bowed, and, followed by the villager, left the room.\r\n\r\n\"Lacy,\" cried the emperor, \"the time for deliberation has gone by. The\r\nhour for decision has struck, and I am free to give battle. It is\r\nFrederick who has thrown down the glove, and I too, shall emerge from\r\nobscurity, and prove to the world that others besides the King of\r\nPrussia are worthy to lead their men to victory. It would be\r\ndishonorable to refuse the challenge he has sent through his invasion of\r\nBohemia. Let orders be given to march to Jaromirs. We shall await the\r\nenemy there; and there at last I shall measure swords with the greatest\r\ncaptain of the age!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXXIV.\r\n\r\nSECRET NEGOTIATIONS FOR PEACE.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of the emperor for the seat of war, the court of\r\nVienna became supremely dull. All the state apartments were closed, the\r\ngentlemen and ladies in waiting went about silent as ghosts, the\r\narchduchesses were pale and sad, and the empress, disconsolate, spent\r\nall her days in the solitude of her own apartments.\r\n\r\nNot only at court, but in the city were all sounds of joy hushed into\r\nspeechless anxiety. Above all, since it had become known that Frederick\r\nhad invaded Bohemia, the Viennese were in a state of painful excitement,\r\nconvinced as they were that the warlike king would never stop his\r\nmarches until they brought him to the gates of Vienna.\r\n\r\nFinally the panic reached the palace. The rich were conveying their\r\ntreasures to places of security, and the archduchesses and ladies of\r\nhonor were importuning the empress to leave Vienna, and remove the court\r\nto Presburg. [Footnote: Dohm's Memoirs, vol. i., p. 187.]\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa turned a deaf ear to these entreaties. Her eyes, which had\r\ngrown dull through weeping, flashed with defiant courage as she replied:\r\n\"I remain here in Vienna, and if the King of Prussia lays siege to my\r\ncapital, I shall die like an empress in imperial panoply. I have never\r\nknown what it was to fear for my life, and if now my heart throbs with\r\nuneasiness, it is for my people, it is not for myself. I mourn for my\r\nsubjects, should Heaven, in its wrath, permit Frederick to prevail. For\r\nthis it is that my life is spent in seclusion and prayer. Come, my\r\ndaughters, come, ladies all, let us betake ourselves to the house of\r\nGod.\"\r\n\r\nAnd leaning upon the arms of the Archduchesses Elizabeth and Christina,\r\nthe empress proceeded to the chapel. Behind them, with downcast eyes and\r\nreluctant steps, came the ladies of the court, all of one mind as to the\r\nweariness of too much godliness and too much praying.\r\n\r\n\"When will the empress's private chapel be completed?\" whispered one of\r\nthe ladies to another. \"When will this daily martyrdom cease? Is it not\r\ntoo bad to be forced to church five times a day?\"\r\n\r\n\"You may thank fortune for your headache yesterday. It was my turn to\r\naccompany the empress to the chapel, and we stayed so long that the\r\nArchduchess Elizabeth told me that toward the end her senses began to\r\nfail her, and she was scarcely able to utter the responses. How is the\r\nArchduchess Marianna to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her highness,\" whispered the first lady, \"is too sensible to recover in\r\na hurry. The wound in her cheek has reopened, and she really suffers a\r\ngreat deal at present. But she bears her pain with great fortitude.\r\nYesterday the English ambassador was paying her a visit of condolence,\r\nand as he was expressing his sympathy, the archduchess interrupted him\r\nwith a laugh. 'Believe me,' said she, 'for a princess of forty, who is\r\nan old maid, even a hole in her own cheek is a godsend. Nothing that\r\nvaries the dull uniformity of my life comes amiss.'\" [Footnote: The\r\narchduchess's own words. See \"Courts of Europe at the Close of the Last\r\nCentury,\" by Henry Swinburne, vol. i., p. 342.]\r\n\r\nBoth ladies tittered, but perceiving that the empress was turning her\r\nhead, they resumed their sanctimonious faces, and folded their hands.\r\n\r\n\"Was it you, ladies,\" said Maria, Theresa, with severity, \"who were\r\ninterrupting our solemn silence by frivolous whisperings?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty,\" replied the first lady of honor. \"We were preparing\r\nourselves for prayer by edifying conversation.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress smiled kindly upon the speaker. \"I know that you are\r\ninclined to religion,\" said she, \"and I am glad that you have had so\r\ngood an influence over the Countess Julia, for she is not wont to be too\r\nzealous at prayer. I will remember you both for your piety, dear\r\nchildren and will see that you are both well married. There is the young\r\nBaron of Palmoden and Count--\",\r\n\r\nBut the empress, who, in her darling schemes of marriage, had forgotten\r\nfor a moment whither they were going, suddenly crossed herself, saying,\r\n\"Forgive me, ladies; let us hasten our steps.\"\r\n\r\nOn this day the empress remained for three hours in the chapel, and\r\nwhile her attendants, worn out by ennui, were some sleeping, or others\r\nwhispering to keep themselves awake, Maria Theresa, before the altar,\r\nwas on her knees, praying with all the fervor of her honest and\r\nbelieving soul. As she prayed, she heaved many a sigh, and many a tear\r\nfell unheeded from her eyes upon her tightly-clasped hands.\r\n\r\nCertainly her prayers proved consolatory, for when they were ended, she\r\nrose from her knees, calm and resolved. As she reached the door of her\r\nown room, she turned to her favorite daughter. \"Is your heart still\r\ndisconsolate, Christina`?\" said she, with a look of supreme tenderness.\r\n\r\n\"How can it be otherwise, my mother?\" said Christina, sobbing. \"Has not\r\nmy cruel and avaricious brother forced my husband into this wicked war?\r\nOh, dearest mother, if you would but speak the word, Albert might be\r\nrelieved from the disgraceful contingency of appearing in arms against\r\nhis native land! He has no alternative, he must either become a traitor\r\nto his own country, or perjure himself by deserting his colors. Oh, your\r\nmajesty, have mercy upon your subjects, and force the rapacious emperor\r\nto forego his unjust claims, and obey your imperial commands!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dry your tears, my daughter,\" replied the empress, kissing her\r\ntenderly; \"I have prayed so fervently for wisdom in this matter, that I\r\nfeel as if my prayers had been answered. What He has commanded I will\r\ndo, and may His grace strengthen and guide me! Hope for the best, my\r\nchild, and do not speak so unkindly of your brother. He is not as cruel\r\nas you represent him; he has always been a dear, obedient son, and I\r\ntrust, I may find him so to the end. Go, now, Christina, and remember\r\nthat God directs all things.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress dismissed her daughters and entered her room, passing\r\nrapidly to the place where hung the portrait of the Emperor Francis. For\r\na long, long while she looked at it without any thing but a vague\r\nyearning to be united to her adored husband. Finally, as was her custom,\r\nshe began to speak to it.\r\n\r\n\"Franz, I have prayed from my soul for light. It seems to me that God\r\nhas spoken, but, oh, my darling, if what I am about to do is unwise,\r\nwhisper me one word of warning, and I shall be passive. Sometimes I\r\nthink that you visit me, beloved, and whisper words of angelic sweetness\r\nin my ear. Speak now, my Franz, speak if I am wrong--I will obey your\r\nvoice.\"\r\n\r\nShe clasped her hands, and looked imploringly at the picture. Finally\r\nshe sighed. \"Your dear face still smiles upon me,\" murmured she, \"and I\r\nmust believe that I have decided for the best. I will act.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, she rang her bell, and a page answered the summons.\r\n\r\n\"Send hither my private secretary, and let a carriage be dispatched for\r\nBaron Thugut. I wish to see him immediately.\"\r\n\r\nA few moments afterward, Koch made his appearance, and in half an hour\r\nafter a page announced Baron Thugut.\r\n\r\n\"Baron,\" said the empress, \"I wish to put a serious question to you.\r\nRemember that God hears you, and answer me without reservation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty has forgotten,\" replied Thugut, \"that I have been so long\r\nin the kingdom of unbelief that I am an unbeliever myself. I do not know\r\nwhether God hears me or not; but as I know that your majesty exacts of\r\nme to be candid, I shall obey your commands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, tell me what is your opinion of the war of the Bavarian\r\nsuccession. Do you think it an equitable one?\"\r\n\r\nThe baron's small black eyes turned from the empress to the secretary.\r\nMaria Theresa understood the glance.\r\n\r\n\"Speak without reserve; Baron Koch is loyal, and knows all my secrets.\r\nDo you think, then, that our claims to Bavaria are just?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just, your majesty?\" repeated Thugut, in his sharp, cutting tones.\r\n\"Their success or their failure must decide that question. He who wins\r\nwill have proved his right. If we succeed in holding Bavaria, Germany\r\nwill uphold us--for Germany never raises her voice against a fait\r\naccompli. Should Frederick unhappily defeat us, not only Germany, but\r\nall Europe will cry out against the greed and injustice of ambitious\r\nAustria.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish to expose myself to this contingency,\" replied the\r\nempress. \"I must have peace with God, the world, and my conscience, and\r\nyou must come to my assistance, Thugut.\"\r\n\r\nAn ironical smile played over Thugut's face. \"With God and your\r\nmajesty's conscience, I would be a poor mediator,\" said he, \"but toward\r\nthe world I am ready to serve your majesty in any shape or form.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you shall mediate between myself and Frederick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Between your majesty and the King of Prussia!\" said Thugut, astonished.\r\n\r\nThe empress nodded her head, and, just then, the door opened, admitting\r\na page who handed two letters on a golden plate. \"The answer of Prince\r\nGallitzin,\" said he, bowing and retiring.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa opened the letters, which were unsealed, saving\r\n\r\n\"Now we have every thing requisite. Here is a passport for you as\r\nprivate secretary to the Russian ambassador; and here is a letter which\r\nyou are to bear from Gallitzin to the king. This is the pretext of your\r\nvisit to Frederick.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the real motive is--\"\r\n\r\n\"You will find it in the letter which I shall intrust to you for him.\r\nRead my letter aloud, Koch.\"\r\n\r\nThe secretary read as follows\r\n\r\n\"From the recall of Baron von Reidsel and the marching of your majesty's\r\ntroops into Bohemia, I perceive with profoundest sorrow that we are on\r\nthe eve of another war. My age, and sincere love of peace, are known to\r\nall the world, and I can give no greater proof of this love than I do by\r\nwriting to your majesty. My maternal heart, too, is sorely grieved with\r\nthe thought that I have two sons and a beloved son-in-law in the army. I\r\nhave taken this step without the knowledge of the emperor, and whatever\r\nits result, I exact that it shall remain a secret between us. It is my\r\ndesire to resume the negotiations which were broken off by my son. Baron\r\nThugut, who will deliver this into your majesty's hands, has received my\r\ninstructions, and is empowered to treat with you. I trust that your\r\nmajesty may deem it consistent with our common dignity to meet my wishes\r\nin this matter, and hope that you also correspond to the earnest desire\r\nwhich I cherish for a continuation of friendly relations with your\r\nmajesty. With this hope I remain, \"Your majesty's affectionate sister\r\nand cousin, \"MARIA THERESA.\" [Footnote: This letter was written in the\r\nFrench language, and is to be found in Cross-Hoffinger's \"Life and\r\nHistory of the Reign of Joseph II.,\" vol. iv., p. 89.]\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty wishes me to bring about a peace. But what sort of peace?\"\r\nasked Thugut. \"A conditional one, or peace at any price?\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa's eyes flashed fire.\r\n\r\n\"Is Austria so weak that she should crave peace at any price?\" cried\r\nshe, proudly.\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed, your majesty. She seems, on the contrary, so powerful that\r\nshe undertakes war at any price. But Bavaria is well worth a war with\r\nPrussia. Allow me one more question. What is the emperor to do with his\r\narmy, while we negotiate?\"\r\n\r\n\"They must await the result. I have written to Leopold to use all his\r\ninfluence to reconcile Joseph, for he will be indignant when he hears\r\nwhat I have done. But until it becomes evident that we cannot treat with\r\nFrederick, the emperor and his generals must remain passive. Should I\r\nfail, my son may then give battle, while his mother intercedes for him.\r\nIf the medicine of diplomacy fails this time, we shall have to resort to\r\nthe knife to heal our political wounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty is right,\" said Thugut, with a heartless laugh. \"When\r\nmedicine fails we use the cold steel; and if that is not enough, fire is\r\nthe last resort. What are your majesty's conditions with Prussia,\r\nmedicine, iron, or fire?\" [Footnote: Thugut's own application of the\r\nold-fashioned method of cure. See Hormayer's \"Contributions to the\r\nHistory of my Fatherland.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Balsam, I trust,\" replied the empress. \"Koch has drawn out my\r\npropositions. And now go and make your preparations to depart, for I\r\nlong for peace with the whole world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXXV.\r\n\r\nFRATERNAL DISCORD.\r\n\r\nVery different were the preparations making by the empress's warlike\r\nson. In company with Lacy and his staff, he had reviewed his troops for\r\nthe last time, and had ridden from one end of their encampment to the\r\nother, that he might personally inspect the condition of his army. He\r\nhad found it cheerful, spirited, and eager for the fray, the officers\r\nassuring him that their men were impatient to meet the enemy, and end\r\nthe campaign by one decisive blow.\r\n\r\nEven Lacy himself ceased to preach caution. He saw in the triumphant\r\nsmile and flashing eyes of Joseph that counsel would be worse than\r\nuseless, and warning would only drive him to some deed of mad daring,\r\nwhich might peril his life, or the safety of his army. The emperor\r\nhimself had planned the attack, and his generals had approved his\r\nstrategy.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the Elbe was the King of Prussia, afraid to cross,\r\nlest the Austrian army, from their secure heights on the opposite shore,\r\nshould annihilate his troops as they attempted the passage.\r\n\r\nBut what Frederick hesitated to undertake, Joseph was resolved to\r\naccomplish. He had determined to cross the Elbe, and force the king to\r\ngive him battle. His columns were to move under cover of night, to ford\r\nthe river below, and, by rapid marches, to reach the Prussian army at\r\nbreak of day.\r\n\r\n\"We shall be victorious, I feel it,\" said the emperor to Lacy, on their\r\nreturn from the encampment. \"I have a joy within my heart that is the\r\nforerunner either of victory or of death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of death!\" echoed Lacy, with surprise. \"Does your majesty mean to say\r\nthat man can encounter death joyfully?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" said the emperor. \"When a man dies, has he not won the long\r\nand bloody battle of life?\"\r\n\r\n\"These are disconsolate words to fall from YOUR lips, sire. To you life\r\nmust present a bright array of hopes and useful deeds. None but an old\r\nand decrepit man should take such gloomy views of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have suffered as much as older men, Lacy,\" returned the emperor,\r\nlaying his hand upon his friend's shoulder \"But all my sufferings are\r\nforgotten in the anticipated joy of the morrow. Let the dead past bury\r\nits dead the birth of my happiness is at hand. I shall no mote rest my\r\ntitle to the world's homage upon the station to which I was born. It\r\nshall know at last that I am worthy to be the friend of Lacy and of\r\nLoudon. All the years that have intervened have never yet sufficed to\r\nblot out the remembrance of that fearful day on which the empress\r\nrecalled the consent she had given for me to meet Frederick in the\r\nfield. I have never looked upon my mother since without feeling the\r\nwound reopen. But to-day I can forgive her. I can even forgive the hated\r\npriests who were the cause of my misfortune. Lacy, I love the whole\r\nworld. I--\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor interrupted himself to stare with astonishment at the figure\r\nof a man, who just then had opened the door.\r\n\r\n\"The Grand Duke of Tuscany!\" exclaimed Lacy.\r\n\r\n\"My brother Leopold,\" murmured Joseph, in a low, tremulous voice, but\r\nwithout rising from his seat, or offering his hand. A cloud passed over\r\nthe pale, sickly face of the grand duke, and the smile vanished from his\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty does not invite me to enter?\" asked he, reproachfully.\r\n\"You do not bid me welcome?\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor gazed upon his brother in silence, and Leopold shrank from\r\nthe keen and searching glances of Joseph's inquiring eyes.\r\n\r\n\"My brother,\" cried the emperor, suddenly, \"you have come hither to\r\nbring me some evil tidings.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have come to greet your majesty, and to enjoy a few hours of family\r\nintercourse with you,\" replied the grand duke, while, without awaiting\r\nthe courtesy which Joseph would not extend, be closed the door, and\r\nadvanced into the room.\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" cried the emperor, \"that is false. We are not such a pair of\r\nloving brothers that you should seek me for affection's sake.\"\r\n\r\nAnd approaching Leopold as he spoke, he stopped just before him, and\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\"I implore of you be generous and tell me what you want. You have\r\nletters from the empress, have you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have. I have not only letters from our imperial mother to deliver to\r\nyour majesty, I am also the bearer of verbal messages, but-\"\r\n\r\n\"But what?\" cried Joseph, as Leopold paused.\r\n\r\n\"But I must request of your majesty to grant me a private interview.\"\r\n\r\n\"With his majesty's permission, I shall withdraw,\" said Lacy. Joseph\r\ninclined his head, and, as Lacy disappeared, he turned his eyes once\r\nmore upon the pale, embarrassed countenance of his unwelcome relative.\r\n\r\n\"Now we are alone,\" said he, breathing fast. \"Now--but no. Give me one\r\nmoment to collect my strength. My God! what evil has the empress in\r\nstore for me now, that she should select you as the messenger of her\r\ncruelty? Peace--I do not wish to hear your voice until I am ready to\r\nlisten to its discordant sounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"I await your commands,\" replied Leopold, with a respectful inclination.\r\n\r\nThe emperor crossed the room several times forth and back. His cheeks\r\nwere blanched, his mouth quivered, while quick and gasping came the\r\nbreath from his heaving chest.\r\n\r\n\"Air, air!\" said he in a stifled voice. \"I shall suffocate!\" He\r\napproached the window, and leaning far out, inhaled the cold winter\r\nblast, whose icy breath was welcome to his hot and fevered head. After a\r\nwhile, he closed the window and turned to his brother, who, with folded\r\narms, still stood near the door.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Joseph, gloomily, \"I am ready to hear. Speak out, your\r\ninfernal errand!\"\r\n\r\n\"I must first beg pardon of your majesty if the intelligence which I am\r\ncompelled to communicate is unwelcome,\" began Leopold, in a deprecating\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nJoseph cast a rapid, searching look athwart the perplexed face of his\r\nbrother. \"You are forgiven,\" replied he, contemptuously. \"Your message\r\nseems to be punishment enough of itself, if I judge by your countenance.\r\nLet us be quick, then, and be done with one another. Give me the letter,\r\nand say at once what you have to say.\"\r\n\r\nThe grand duke took from his coat-pocket a sealed dispatch which he\r\ndelivered to the emperor.\r\n\r\n\"Here are the letters of the empress, but she ordered me to accompany\r\nthem with a few words explanatory of her motives. She commissioned me to\r\ntell what she found it difficult to write.\"\r\n\r\n\"She was afraid,\" muttered Joseph.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she was afraid to commit an injustice,\" returned Leopold. \"She was\r\nafraid to offend her Maker by continuing a war whose object was to break\r\none of His holy commandments--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my brother!\" interrupted Joseph, sarcastically, \"you are yourself\r\nagain--I recognize the dutiful son of the priests who denounce me\r\nbecause I would disturb them in their comfortable Bavarian nest. I see\r\nplainly that if I should be so unfortunate as to fall to-morrow on the\r\nbattle-field, you will throw yourself into the arms of Frederick and of\r\nthat frantic amazon, the Duchess Clemens, beg pardon for my sins, and\r\nhand over the fairest portion of Germany to pope and Jesuits. Oh, what a\r\nfavorite you would become with the black-coats! Doubtless they would\r\ngive you absolution for all the sins you are accustomed to commit\r\nagainst your wife, but, my virtuous brother, I shall outlive the\r\nmorrow, that I promise you, and shall gain such a victory over\r\nFrederick as will astound you and the whole popedom.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were about to give battle to Frederick?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am about to do so,\" replied Joseph, defiantly.\r\n\r\n\"Then it was time for me to come!\" exclaimed Leopold, solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"The mercy of God has sent me to stop the carnage! My brother, the\r\nempress earnestly entreats you, by the tears she has shed for your sake,\r\nto desist from fighting! As your empress she commands you to sheathe\r\nyour sword until you hear the result of the negotiations now pending\r\nbetween herself and the King of Prussia.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor uttered a cry of rage, and the angry blood darted to his\r\nvery brow. \"The empress has opened negotiations without my consent!\"\r\ncried he, in a voice of mingled indignation and incredulity.\r\n\r\n\"The empress requires the consent of no one to regulate her state\r\npolicy. In the supremacy of her own power, she has reopened negotiations\r\nwith the King of Prussia, and hopes to terminate the war honorably\r\nwithout bloodshed.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is false, I will not believe it!\" again cried Joseph. \"My mother\r\nwould not offer me such indignity, when she herself placed in my hand\r\nthe sword with which I seek to defend my rights. It is a priest's lie,\r\nand you have been commissioned to be its interpreter. But this time your\r\npious frauds will come to naught. Take back your packet. It is not the\r\nempress's handwriting.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is that of her private secretary.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not bound to respect his writing, and I have no time to listen to\r\nyour stupid remonstrances. Wait till day after to-morrow. When a man is\r\nflushed with victory, he is generous and ready to pardon. When I have\r\nbeaten Frederick, I shall have leisure to inquire into the authenticity\r\nof your papers. Remain with me, not as the emissary of priests and\r\nJesuits, but as the brother of the emperor, who to-morrow is to win his\r\nfirst victory and his first budding laurels. Give me your hand. On the\r\neve of a battle, I am willing to remember that we are brothers.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this is not the eve of a battle, your majesty. The empress commands\r\nyou to await the result of her efforts to end the war.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have already told you that I see through your intrigues.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have the proofs of my veracity in these papers. You will not read\r\nthem?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I will not!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I shall read them myself,\" returned Leopold, breaking the seal.\r\n\"The empress commands you, and it is your duty as her subject to obey.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall obey when I am convinced that the empress commands. But in this\r\ncase I am convinced that it is not my mother, the high-spirited Maria\r\nTheresa, who intrusts you with such an abject commission.\"\r\n\r\n\"You surely will not deny her handwriting?\" returned Leopold, extending\r\nan open letter to his brother.\r\n\r\nJoseph looked imploringly at his brother's calm face.\r\n\r\n\"You are resolved to show me no mercy,\" said he. \"You will not\r\nunderstand my refusal to believe. Listen to me, Leopold. Show that you\r\nlove me for once in your life. Think of my joyless youth, my sorrowing\r\nmanhood, my life of perpetual humiliation, and give me one day of\r\nindependent action.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does your majesty mean'?\" asked the grand duke.\r\n\r\nThe emperor came up to him, and putting both his hands upon Leopold's\r\nshoulder, he said in a voice of deep emotion; \"Majesty asks nothing of\r\nyou, but your brother entreats you to serve him this day. See, Leopold,\r\nit is too late, I cannot retract upon the very eve of battle. The army\r\nknows that we are about to engage the enemy, and my men are wild with\r\nenthusiasm. The presence of Frederick upon Austrian soil is an indignity\r\nwhich I am pledged as a man to avenge. If I allow him to retreat from\r\nhis present disadvantageous position, my name is gone forever, and all\r\nEurope will cry out upon my incapacity to command. Remember, Leopold,\r\nthat it concerns not my honor alone, but the honor of Austria, that this\r\nbattle should be fought. Rescue us both by a magnanimous falsehood. Go\r\nback to the empress. Tell her that you lost her letters and that I would\r\nnot take your word. Meanwhile, I shall have humiliated the enemy, and\r\nMaria Theresa will have been forced to submit to an event which she\r\ncannot recall. Let us burn these papers, Leopold,\" continued Joseph,\r\npassionately clasping his hands, \"and God will forgive you the innocent\r\ndeception by which your brother shall have won fame and glory.\"\r\n\r\n\"God will never pardon me for sinning so deeply against my conscience,\"\r\nreplied Leopold, unmoved. \"You require of me to burn those papers and\r\nconsign thousands of your own subjects to death and worse than\r\ndeath--the lingering agonies of the battle-field. Never! Oh, my dear\r\nbrother, have pity on yourself, and bethink you that you peril your own\r\nsalvation by such thirst of blood--\"\r\n\r\n\"Peace!--and answer my question,\" cried Joseph, stamping his foot. \"Will\r\nyou do what I ask of you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Joseph, I will not do it. The empress desires to spare the blood of\r\nher people, and we must obey her just demands.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not obey!\" cried Joseph with such violence that his face was\r\nempurpled with passion. \"I am co-regent, and as a man and a commander,\r\nit is my right to defend the honor of the crown. I will not read those\r\nletters, and I choose to assert the superiority of my manhood by doing\r\nthat which they forbid. In your eyes and those of the empress, I may be\r\na rebel, but the world will acquit me, and I shall be honored for my\r\njust resistance. You will not destroy the papers as I implored you to\r\ndo?--then give them to me, and so satisfy your tender conscience.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Leopold, who had replaced the dispatches in his pocket,\r\n\"for I see that you intend to destroy them.\"\r\n\r\n\"That need not concern you. Give me the letters.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Joseph, I will not give them.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor uttered a hoarse cry, and darted toward his brother with\r\nuplifted arm.\r\n\r\n\"Give me the papers!\" said he, with his teeth set.\r\n\r\n\"What! you would strike me!\" said Leopold retreating.\r\n\r\n\"Give me the papers!\" thundered the emperor, \"or I fell you to the earth\r\nas I would a beast!\" and he came yet nearer.\r\n\r\nPale and panting, their eyes flashing with anger, the brothers stood for\r\na moment confronting each other.\r\n\r\n\"Refuse me once again,\" hissed Joseph in a low, unnatural voice, \"refuse\r\nme once again, and my hand shall smite your cowardly face and disgrace\r\nyou forever; for, as God hears me, you shall never have satisfaction for\r\nthe affront.\"\r\n\r\nLeopold was silent, but with his eyes fixed upon Joseph, he retreated,\r\nfarther and still farther, followed by the emperor, who, still with\r\nuplifted hand, threatened his brother's face. Suddenly Leopold reached\r\nthe door and, bursting it open, rushed into the anteroom. With a\r\ntiger-bound he sprang forward to Lacy who had remained there in\r\nobedience to the emperor's orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE DEFEAT.\r\n\r\n\"Field-Marshal Lacy,\" said the grand duke, \"I claim your protection--the\r\nprotection of a man whom the empress has honored, and who has sworn to\r\nobey her as his lawful sovereign.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even unto death,\" added Lacy solemnly.\r\n\r\nThe emperor groaned aloud, and his upraised arm fell powerless to his\r\nside. A triumphant smile flickered over the pale features of Leopold. He\r\nthrust his hand into his pocket and drew forth the dispatches of the\r\nempress.\r\n\r\n\"The empress charged me,\" said he, \"in case the emperor refused to read\r\nthese letters, to deliver them to you, Marshal Lacy, and to bid you, in\r\nmy presence, read them to him. Come, then, your excellency, let us obey\r\nthe commands of our sovereign.\"\r\n\r\nLacy bowed, and followed the grand duke in silence. The emperor\r\nretreated to his cabinet, and, sinking upon a sofa, buried his face in\r\nhis hands. Nothing interrupted the stillness save the measured footsteps\r\nof Lacy and the grand duke, who entered and closed the door behind them.\r\nA long pause ensued. The grand duke retired to a window, where, with his\r\narms folded, he awaited the development of affairs with recovered\r\ncomposure. Joseph still sat with his face hidden by his hands, while\r\nLacy with military decorum stood at the door with his letters, silent\r\nuntil the emperor should signify that he might read. Finding that Joseph\r\nwould not speak, Lacy took a few steps forward. \"Does your majesty allow\r\nme to read the letters which, in the name of the empress, his imperial\r\nhighness, the grand duke, has delivered to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Read,\" said Joseph hoarsely, but without removing his hands. Lacy\r\napproached the table, and from the various documents which he unfolded\r\nand examined, selected the letter which was in the empress's own hand--\r\n\r\n\"My Dearest Emperor and Son: As co-regent and heir to my throne, I\r\nhasten to advise you of the negotiations which have just been renewed\r\nbetween the King of Prussia and myself. I have every hope that they will\r\nterminate to our satisfaction, and thus not only save the lives of many\r\nof our subjects, but relieve my heart of the pangs it has endured during\r\nthe absence of my beloved son. The King of Prussia has promised that,\r\npending our diplomatic correspondence, he will not attack our armies. I\r\ntherefore hope that you, my son, will concede as much, and scrupulously\r\navoid all collision that might interrupt our negotiations. I send you\r\ncopies of our correspondence, and will continue to do so regularly.\r\nHoping that God in His goodness will restore to me my imperial son, I\r\nremain now as ever, your affectionate mother and empress, \"MARIA\r\nTHERESA.\"\r\n\r\nA deep sign that was almost a sob was heaved by the emperor. Slowly his\r\nhands fell from his face, while with tearful eyes he turned to Lacy, and\r\nsaid, \"Is it really so? Are my hopes of glory all frustrated?\"\r\n\r\nLacy answered with another sigh and a slight raising of the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Read on, Lacy,\" continued the emperor, mildly; \"my eyes are dim and I\r\ncannot see.\"\r\n\r\nLacy continued reading the correspondence: first the letter of the\r\nempress; then the reply of the king, in which he promised that Maria\r\nTheresa should have nothing to fear for the life of her beloved son.\r\n\r\nWhen the emperor heard this he started; the color mounted to his face,\r\nthen faded away and left it pale as before. His lips moved, but with a\r\nconvulsive twitch he closed them again, and listened in silence. Two\r\nmore letters followed, full of mutual and distinguished consideration;\r\nthen came the propositions of the empress and the comments of the king.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa pledged herself, from that portion of Bavaria of which\r\nAustria had possession, to retain only so much as would yield a revenue\r\nof one million, offering to cede the remainder to the elector palatine,\r\nor to exchange with him for territory situated elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThen followed Frederick's conditions. He stipulated that Austria should\r\nrenounce all pretensions to Bavaria, contenting herself with a small\r\nportion of Upper Bavaria, and recognizing and upholding the claims of\r\nCharles Theodore, as well as those of his heir, the Duke of Zweibrucken.\r\n\r\n\"Further, further!\" exclaimed Joseph, as Lacy paused.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing further, sire; the correspondence ceases there.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to these disgraceful propositions we are not permitted to make the\r\nonly answer of which they are deserving--that is, to wipe them out with\r\nblood! Oh, Lacy, Lacy, is it not fearful to be compelled like a\r\nschoolboy to submit to the punishment which my tormentor judges fit to\r\ninflict?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a painful duty, sire; but it is a duty, and your majesty must\r\nsubmit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must not submit!\" exclaimed Joseph in bitter anguish, while he sprang\r\nfrom the sofa. But suddenly his eager, fluttering glances were turned\r\ntoward the window where stood the grand duke quietly surveying his\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\n\"Have you not gone?\" asked the, emperor. \"I thought that your mission\r\nbeing fulfilled, your imperial highness had nothing more to do here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I await your majesty's answer,\" replied the grand duke. \"Oh, you wish\r\nto mock me, do you?\" cried Joseph, trembling with passion, \"for well you\r\nknow there is but one answer to the empress's commands, and that\r\nis--obedience. But since you are anxious to take a message, here is one,\r\nand mark it well. Say to the empress that I submit as becomes her\r\nsubject, and so long as it suits her without my knowledge and behind my\r\nback to hold conferences with the enemy, I will abstain from engaging\r\nhim in battle, although by so doing I shall ruin my reputation forever.\r\nTell her furthermore that should she accept the dishonorable proposals\r\nmade by Frederick and conclude a peace upon the basis of his conditions,\r\nshe need never expect to see me again in Vienna. I never shall go near\r\nher so long as I live, but shall take up my abode in Aix la Chapelle, or\r\nin some other free city, as it was once the custom of the Emperors of\r\nGermany to do.\"' [Footnote: Joseph's own words. See Dohm's Memoirs vol.\r\ni., p. 143.]\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sire!\" exclaimed Lacy, shocked, \"retract those words, I implore of\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not retract them,\" replied Joseph, imperatively; \"I order the\r\nenvoy of the empress to repeat them faithfully.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall obey your majesty, the co-regent of the empress,\" said the\r\nGrand Duke of Tuscany. \"Has your majesty any other commands?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" shouted the emperor, fiercely. \"When you shall have accomplished\r\nyour mission in Vienna, go home to your priests in Tuscany, and bid them\r\nsay a mass for the repose of your brother's soul, for from this day you\r\nhave lost him who was called Joseph. He is dead to you forever.\"\r\n\r\nThe grand duke returned his brother's look with one of equal hatred. \"I\r\ncan scarcely lose that which I have never possessed,\" replied he with\r\ncomposure. \"Had the affront which your majesty has put upon me to-day\r\ncome from a brother, we should have measured swords together before the\r\nsun had set upon the insult. But he who stands before me is my emperor,\r\nand of him I am prohibited from demanding satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our paths in life lie apart, and I trust that we shall never be forced\r\nto look upon each other again,\" said Joseph in reply.\r\n\r\n\"Since we can never meet as brothers, I am compelled to echo the wish,\"\r\nreturned Leopold. \"Farewell!\"\r\n\r\n\"Farewell--and let it be farewell forever!\"\r\n\r\nThe grand duke crossed the room and opened the door, while Joseph\r\nwatched his disappearance with glaring eyes and stormy brow, and Lacy in\r\nanguish of heart looked first at one brother, then at the other. The\r\ndoor closed, and the jar it made caused Lacy of start. He recovered\r\nhimself and hastened to the emperor's side.\r\n\r\n\"Call him back, sire,\" implored he. \"Call him back. He is your brother\r\nand the son of your mother. He is also the hope of those who tremble\r\nwith apprehension of your majesty's reign.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes--he is the leader of my enemies, the head of the pious\r\nconspirators who have cursed my life by their diabolical opposition. But\r\na day will come when I shall crush the whole brood in their owl's nest,\r\nand put my house in order. In that day I shall remember this interview\r\nwith the Grand Duke of Tuscany.\" [Footnote: The two brothers never met\r\nagain. Although Leopold was next heir to the crown, Joseph would not\r\nallow him to receive the title of King of Rome, but bestowed it upon\r\nLeopold's son and heir, Francis. Even upon his death-bed the emperor\r\nrefused to see his brother. By his explicit commands, it was only when\r\nhis death had taken place, that a courier was sent to inform Leoold of\r\nhis accession to the throne.]\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" insisted Lacy, \"I entreat of you, recall him--if not as your\r\nbrother, as the envoy of your sovereign. Before it is too late, retract\r\nthose fearful words, which in a moment of--\"\r\n\r\n\"Lacy!\" interrupted the emperor, in a loud, angry voice, \"I have this\r\nday lost a brother and a battle. Am I also to lose a friend?\"\r\n\r\nThe tears rose to Lacy's eyes. \"Sire,\" said he in a voice of emotion,\r\n\"forgive your truest friend if he has presumed to oppose you. I have no\r\nkindred to love: my heart is bound to you, and if I lose your regard, I\r\nam desolate and alone in the world!\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall not lose it, my dear, dear friend,\" exclaimed Joseph,\r\nthrowing his arms around Lacy's neck. \"O God, you do not know how I\r\nsuffer I I feel as if I had lost some beloved friend. And is it not so?\r\nHave I not buried to-day the hopes of a whole life? The hopes which from\r\nmy youth I had cherished of winning glory and fame through Frederick's\r\nhumiliation!--I would give years of my life to have measured swords with\r\nhim, for--let me tell you a secret, Lacy--I hate that man as much as I\r\nonce fancied that I loved him. He is the cause of every misfortune that\r\nhas befallen our house for forty years past. His fame is our shame, his\r\nsplendor our obscuration. I might forgive him his robbery of Silesia,\r\nbut that he has reduced me to the role of an imitator, I can never\r\nforgive! Every thing on earth that I imagine, he executes before me. If\r\nI desire to free my people from the dominion of the clergy, he has\r\nalready liberated his; if I seek to advance art, literature, or\r\nmanufactures, he has just afforded them protection in Prussia; if I\r\nrecommend toleration, lo! he has removed the disabilities of the Jews,\r\nand has pronounced all sects equal before the law. Would I excel in\r\nmusic, or yearn for military glory, the world has long since pronounced\r\nhim a hero, and his flute was heard before I learned the violoncello.\r\nOh, I hate him, I hate him, for his greatness is the rock upon which my\r\noriginality is fated to split; and his shadow projects forever before me\r\nand my unborn deeds. He forces me to pass for a counterfeit of his true\r\ncoin, and yet I feel that my individuality is as marked as his! He is\r\nthe evil genius of my destiny, vanquishing me even in that which I would\r\nhave done for the good of my subjects and the advancement of the world!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty goes too far,\" said Lacy, smiling. \"There is one thing\r\nwhich Frederick has never dreamed of doing, and it is precisely there\r\nthat you are destined to eclipse him. He has never sought to do any\r\nthing for Germany. A German prince, the ruler of a German people, he is\r\nthe patron of foreign industry, literature, and art. The most\r\ninsignificant writer in France is better known to him than Lessing or\r\nWinklemann; and while he is perfectly familiar with the composers of\r\nItaly, be has blundered into depreciation of Gluck's inspired music.\r\nThere is the great and glorious contrast which your majesty presents to\r\nFrederick of Prussia; and the German people, whom he has despised, will\r\nlook up to you, sire, as to the Messiah of their decaying greatness.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will foil me there as in all else,\" replied Joseph, disconsolately.\r\n\"Has he not already guessed my plans in Germany, and has he not torn my\r\nbanner from my hand to flaunt it above his own head, as the defender of\r\nGerman liberties! And Maria Theresa, too, is deceived by his infernal\r\nlogic. Oh, Lacy! I hate him beyond expression. I hate him for the letter\r\nwherein he promises to spare her son, a man whom he loves, although he\r\ndiffers with him on the subject of German nationality. [Footnote:\r\nGross-Hoffinger, \"Records of the Life of Joseph II.,\" p. 41.] The\r\ncowardly remnant of a warrior! He takes refuge under my mother's hooped\r\npetticoat, and whispers in her credulous ear that this war is a great\r\nsin. Do you really think that I am bound to sheathe my sword at the ipse\r\ndixit of my mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your mother is the reigning empress, sire, and it is for you to give to\r\nher other subjects an example of loyalty and obedience.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" sighed Joseph, \"I must still the throbbings of my bursting heart,\r\nand suffer in silence!\"\r\n\r\nFor a while he paced the room with hasty, uncertain steps, murmuring\r\ninaudible words, and darting despairing looks toward the window, whence\r\ngay throngs of soldiery were to be seen preparing to leave the\r\nencampment, while they sang their martial songs, and speculated together\r\nupon the events of the morrow. Suddenly the emperor turned his head\r\ntoward Lacy, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Field-marshal, I withdraw my plans of battle. The empress-queen has\r\nspoken, it is for us to obey. Apprise the army of the change. We remain\r\nwhere we are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" exclaimed Lacy enthusiastically, \"your victory has been won\r\nto-day. A victory over self!\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor raised his eyes with a sad, weary expression, and shook his\r\nhead: \"It was harder to win than could have been that which I\r\ncontemplated for to-morrow. Go, Lacy, go, we must still hope and\r\npray--pray God to grant that at some future day we may be revenged.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE REVENGE.\r\n\r\nLacy had assembled the generals and the staff-officers to communicate\r\nthe decision of the emperor; while the latter, overcome by this supreme\r\ndisappointment, was pacing his cabinet with heavy and measured step.\r\nThen he stood at the window, and watched the movements of his soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"They have heard it now,\" thought he, \"and the word has gone forth, 'The\r\nemperor is afraid to meet the old hero.' Yes, my brave soldiers, I know\r\nfull well that you despise me! Your songs have ceased--your spirit is\r\ncrushed, and, ah, mine also! This unfought battle is worth a victory to\r\nFrederick; for the army will think that my courage failed me, and the\r\nKing of Prussia will still remain in their estimation the invincible foe\r\nof Austria! Oh, when will the hour of retribution sound?\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment a knock was heard at the door, and an adjutant announced\r\nto the emperor that a hussar, belonging to a Galician regiment stationed\r\ndirectly opposite to the Prussian encampment, wished to communicate\r\nsomething of importance.\r\n\r\n\"Admit him,\" said Joseph, wearily.\r\n\r\nThe adjutant bowed, and returned, accompanied by a stalwart figure,\r\nattired in the fanciful and becoming costume of a Galician hussar. The\r\nemperor returned his salute with a slight bend of the head, and motioned\r\nhim to approach. The adjutant withdrew, and Joseph was alone with the\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\"Now speak,\" said the emperor, \"and if you have important tidings, let\r\nme hear them.\"\r\n\r\nThe soldier raised his head, and spoke. \"I have come to do your majesty\r\na service, but first you must promise to reward me as becomes an\r\nemperor.\"\r\n\r\n\"If your service is great, your reward shall be in proportion.\"\r\n\r\nThe soldier bowed. \"I am on picket duty immediately on the bank, of the\r\nElbe. As I have lain among the bushes, I have more than once seen the\r\nKing of Prussia just opposite to me, taking a survey of our strength.\r\nLittle thinks he, as he reins in his horse, that a sharpshooter's ball\r\nis not too far off to bring him down. But I have thought of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have thought of WHAT?\" exclaimed Joseph, shocked.\r\n\r\n\"I have thought that my ball has never yet missed its man, and what a\r\nrich man I might become if I were to free Austria from its worst enemy.\r\nI was turning this over in my mind yesterday, when here comes the king\r\non his gray horse, and halts directly in front of me. He held a cane in\r\nhis hand, and pointed with it toward our encampment, and beat the air\r\nwith it, as though he were showing his officers how he was going to\r\nthrash the Austrian army. When I saw this, my blood began to boil, and I\r\nrose half up, and cocked my gun. Many a Bosnian have I brought down with\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" said the emperor, as the soldier paused, and threw an admiring\r\nglance upon his musket.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire, I raised my gun, and took aim, when I began to reflect\r\nthat--\"\r\n\r\n\"That what?\" exclaimed Joseph, upon whose forehead great drops of sweat\r\nhad begun to gather.\r\n\r\n\"That it would be better first to ask the emperor's permission, and get\r\nthe promise of a reward,\" said the hussar, with a salute.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" cried the emperor, breathing freely, \"that was a lucky thought of\r\nyours.\"\r\n\r\nThe soldier bowed low. \"I put down my musket, and when the hour came\r\nround for me to be relieved, I asked leave of my captain to come here to\r\nsee an old acquaintance. And, indeed, your majesty, I was not telling a\r\nlie, for you once slept under my father's roof, and paid him so well for\r\nthe night's lodging, that he was able to buy some land to settle me upon\r\nit, and thereupon I married my sweetheart. So that I did come to see an\r\nold acquaintance; and now, your majesty, I have a firm hand and a sharp\r\neye, and if you say so, Frederick shall bite the dust before this day\r\nweek.\"\r\n\r\n\"What said your captain to such a proposal?\"\r\n\r\n\"Does your majesty suppose that I am such a fool as to give another man\r\nthe chance of stepping in my shoes?\"\r\n\r\n\"It follows thence that I am the only person in your confidence,\" said\r\nJoseph, much relieved.\r\n\r\n\"The only one, sire, and I believe that you will not misuse it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I will not, and as a reward for your trust in me, here are two gold\r\npieces.\"\r\n\r\nAt first the soldier smiled as he received the gold, but presently his\r\nbrow darkened, and casting a dissatisfied look at the emperor from\r\nbehind his busby eyebrows, he said, \"Is the life of the King of Prussia\r\nworth but two ducats?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is worth more than all the gold in my imperial treasury,\" replied\r\nthe emperor, with energy; \"and no man on earth is rich enough to pay for\r\nit. I gave you these ducats to repay what you spent in coming from your\r\ncamp hither. But I shall reward you still further if you will promise\r\nnot to divulge what you have confided to me. Not only that, but I will\r\nalso give you your discharge from the army, send you home, and give you\r\na situation as imperial huntsman. If you break your promise, I will\r\npunish you with death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, I promise, and I shall never break my word.\"\r\n\r\n\"Swear it in the name of God and of the Blessed Virgin.\"\r\n\r\n\"I swear,\" said the soldier, raising his right hand to heaven. \"And now,\r\nyour majesty, that no one is to know it except us two, when shall I\r\nshoot the King of Prussia, and return to my home?\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor looked sternly upon the unconscious hussar. \"Soldier,\" said\r\nhe, in loud and solemn tones, \"keep the gold I have given you in\r\nremembrance of the warning which your good angel whispered, when you\r\nforbore to murder the King of Prussia. I hope and believe that every man\r\namong you would risk his life in battle to take him prisoner, but God\r\nforbid that any one of you should stoop so low as to become his\r\nmurderer!\"\r\n\r\nThe man stared at the emperor in utter bewilderment, and not a word of\r\nreply was be able to make to this incomprehensible harangue.\r\n\r\nThe emperor continued: \"I pardon your evil thought because it did not\r\ngerminate into an evil deed. But had you followed your impulse to murder\r\nthe king, I would have hung you without giving you time to see a priest.\r\nThank God for your escape, and let us dismiss the disgraceful subject\r\nforever. You can remain here for the night.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have only six hours' leave of absence, sire.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor looked distrustfully at the soldier. \"I have discharged you\r\nfrom the service, and will see that you are not molested. \"\r\n\r\n\"And I am really to go home?\" cried the man, overjoyed. \"And the emperor\r\nreally means to fulfil his promise in spite of the dreadful reprimand I\r\nhave received?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I mean to fulfil my promise. But you also must swear to live a\r\npeaceful life, and never try to kill another man save in open fight,\r\nwere he even a Bosnian.\"\r\n\r\n\"From my heart, I swear,\" replied the soldier, solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"Now you can go.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor then rang his bell, when the door opened, and Gunther\r\nentered the room.\r\n\r\n\"Gunther,\" said he, \"give this man his supper and a bed in your room,\r\nand, while he remains here, see that his wants are attended to.\"\r\n\r\nGunther bowed, and retired with the hussar. The emperor followed the\r\ngigantic figure of the soldier until the door closed upon him, then he\r\nraised his eyes to heaven with a look of unspeakable gratitude.\r\n\r\n\"Lord,\" said he, \"I have suffered cruelly since the sun rose to-day, but\r\noh! how I thank Thee that Thou hast preserved my name from eternal\r\ninfamy! How would the world have spurned me, if, refusing to give him\r\nbattle, I had taken the life of my enemy through the hands of an\r\nAustrian soldier! My God! my God! the life of Frederick has become more\r\nprecious to me than my own--for HIS life is one with MY honor.\r\n\r\n\"But what, if another should execute what this Galician has conceived?\"\r\ncontinued the emperor, shuddering. \"What if, in his ignorance, another\r\none of these wild huntsmen should deem it his duty to take the life of\r\nFrederick?\" The emperor grew pale with the thought, and his hand was\r\nlifted as if to protest against the crime. \"I must find means to shield\r\nmyself from such disgrace, for his safety and my honor are cast on the\r\nsame die.\"\r\n\r\nFar into the night Gunther heard the tread of his Imperial master, and\r\nhe waited in vain to be called in to attend him. He watched until the\r\ndawn of day, and when, at last, unable to contain his anxiety, he opened\r\nthe door of the cabinet, he saw the emperor asleep in an arm-chair. He\r\nwas in full uniform, and the rays of the rising sun lit up his pale\r\nface, which, even in sleep, wore an anxious and painful expression.\r\n\r\nGunther approached, and touched him lightly.\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" said he, in a voice of tender entreaty, \"let me assist you to\r\nundress. This is the fourth night that your majesty has slept in your\r\nuniform. You must lie down, indeed you must.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph opened his eyes, and looked at Gunther.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" sighed he, \"during three of these nights I might just as well have\r\nslept in my bed as any respectable burgher who has nothing to trouble\r\nhim but his growing corpulence. But last night I dared not undress, for\r\nI have much to do this morning. Good Heaven! Gunther,\" continued the\r\nemperor, suddenly remembering the hussar, \"what has become of the man\r\nwhom I gave into your custody last evening?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty's second valet is in the same bed with him, and they are\r\nboth asleep. The door between our sleeping-room and the anteroom has\r\nbeen open all night, so that, while I sat there awaiting your majesty's\r\ncall, I had the hussar directly under my eyes. He seems to have pleasant\r\ndreams, if I judge by his smiles and snatches of songs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let him sleep, Gunther, and when he awakes, allow no one to hold any\r\nconversation with him. Now give me a glass of fresh water for my\r\nbreakfast.\"\r\n\r\nGunther hastened to obey, and returned in a very few minutes. The\r\nemperor emptied the glass at a draught.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed he, refreshed, \"how delightful it is! I have not a cook\r\nin my palace capable of brewing me such a beverage.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet the meanest of your subjects, sire, would grumble if he had\r\nnothing better than a glass of water for breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt of it, Gunther. Men set no value upon that which is easily\r\nobtained. If I were to close up the fountains, and forbid them to drink\r\nwater for breakfast, they would raise a howl, and protest that they\r\ncould drink nothing else. And if I desired to give them a taste for\r\nassafoetida, I would have nothing to do but forbid its use. Once\r\nforbidden to the multitude, the multitude would go mad for it. But see,\r\nthe sun has sent a ray through the window to bid us good-morning, and to\r\nwarn me that it is time to depart. Order my horse to be saddled: Tell\r\nsome of the staff to prepare to accompany me, and then go to\r\nField-Marshal Lacy, and request him to go with me this morning on a tour\r\nof inspection.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lacy,\" said the emperor, as they galloped off together, \"you must\r\nprepare yourself for a long ride. We had anticipated an early start\r\nto-day, and we are punctual. To be sure, we are minus an army, and\r\nneither our hearts nor our trumpets are sounding triumphant blasts of\r\nvictory. Ah, friend, what miserable puppets we are in the hands of\r\nAlmighty God! Yesterday I was gazing exultingly upon the heaven of the\r\nfuture, so clear, so blue, so silver-bright--when lo! the rustling of a\r\nwoman's dress is heard, and the sky of my destiny grows black as night.\r\nYesterday I fancied myself a man--to-day I am a schoolboy in disgrace\r\nupon my knees. Oh, Lacy, those weary knees ache me so, that I could sob\r\nfor pain, were it not laughable for a commander-in-chief to put his\r\nhandkerchief to his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Good God! Lacy,\" shouted the emperor, suddenly, while he reined in his\r\nhorse until the animal almost fell upon his haunches, \"why do you not\r\nlaugh? You see that I am doing my best to divert you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot laugh, sire, when you yourself are suffering almost to\r\nmadness!\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor made no reply, but rode cu, relaxing his speed until his\r\nhorse ambled gently over the road. \"Lacy,\" said he, finally, \"I am\r\nunreasonable when I murmur against destiny, for yesterday Providence was\r\nmost benign toward me. Some other time, you shall hear in what manner.\r\nLet us quicken our pace, for to-day I must visit all the outposts. I\r\nhave an order to promulgate to the pickets, of which I shall explain to\r\nyou the reason when we return.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after the emperor had spoken, they reached the front. Joseph\r\nsprang forward to the very edge of the river-bank, and looked earnestly\r\ntoward the opposite shore. Nothing was to be seen, save far away on the\r\nhorizon, a few black specks which showed the outposts of the enemy. The\r\nemperor signed to the officer on duty to approach.\r\n\r\n\"Do the Prussians ever venture any nearer?\" asked he.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire. They seem to be officers of high rank making a\r\nreconnaissance, probably with a view to finding a crossing for their\r\narmy. They sometimes approach so close that the sharpshooters, who have\r\neyes like telescopes, recognize the King of Prussia in the group.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is quite possible that in the excitement of a survey, the king may\r\napproach the shore. In the event of such an accident, I have a command\r\nto give to your men. As soon as they recognize the king, they shall\r\npresent arms, and remain thus until he is entirely out of sight. I\r\ndesire, through this courtesy, to express the respect due to a crowned\r\nhead, a great general, and a personal friend of my own. This order must\r\nbe strictly enforced by the officer of the day.\" [Footnote: The\r\nemperor's own words. See Gross-Hoffinger, i., p 431.]\r\n\r\nThe emperor then inclined his head, and rode off with his staff. At each\r\noutpost the order for presenting arms to Frederick was repeated, and the\r\nofficers charged with its execution to the letter.\r\n\r\nLate in the day Joseph returned from his long and tiresome visit of\r\ninspection. But so far from suffering fatigue, he sprang from his horse\r\nwith a light bound, and his countenance was as free from gloom as it had\r\nbeen before the arrival of the Grand Duke of Tuscany.\r\n\r\n\"Lacy,\" said he, taking the arm of the field-marshal, \"I am about to\r\nexplain to you the cause of my over-politeness to my abhorred enemy. You\r\nmust have been astounded at the orders I have been giving to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"To tell the truth, I was surprised. But I thought that in the nobleness\r\nof your heart, sire, you were proving to me that you had relinquished\r\nall thoughts of revenge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, Lacy, my hate is unappeased and I have kept my word. I\r\nhave already had my revenge. I have saved the King of Prussia from the\r\nbullet of an assassin.\" [Footnote: This whole chapter is historical. See\r\nRiedler's archives for 1831, and Gross-Hoffinger, i., p. 427.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXXVIII.\r\n\r\nA LETTER TO THE EMPRESS OF RUSSIA.\r\n\r\nWith flushed face and panting bosom, Maria Theresa paced her cabinet,\r\nsometimes glancing with angry eyes at the heaps of papers that covered\r\nher escritoire; then wandering hastily to and fro, perfectly insensible\r\nto the fatigue which in her advancing years generally overwhelmed her\r\nwhenever she attempted to move otherwise than leisurely. The empress had\r\nreceived bad news from every quarter; but worst of all were the tidings\r\nthat came from Bohemia. For more than a year the Austrian and Prussian\r\narmies had threatened one another; and yet nothing had been accomplished\r\ntoward the settlement of the Bavarian succession.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa, shocked by the threat which Joseph had made to her\r\nthrough the Grand Duke of Tuscany, had broken off her negotiations with\r\nFrederick, and had sacrificed the dearest wishes of her heart to appease\r\nthe fury of her imperial son. Notwithstanding this, no battle had been\r\nfought, for Frederick was quite as desirous as the empress could be, to\r\navoid an engagement. He had declared war against his old adversary with\r\nthe greatest alacrity; but when it became necessary to manoeuvre his\r\narmy, the hero of so many fights was obliged to confess in the secrecy\r\nof his own heart that his gouty hand was impotent to draw the sword, and\r\nhis tottering limbs were fitter to sink into an arm-chair than to\r\nbestride a war-horse.\r\n\r\nIrritable, crabbed, and low-spirited, his campaign had proved a\r\ndisastrous failure. Instead of planning battles, he had planned\r\npillaging and foraging expeditions, and his hungry and disaffected army\r\nhad converted the rich fields of Bohemia into a gloomy and desolate\r\nwaste. At last succoring winter came to the help of the oppressed\r\nBohemians, and both armies went into winter quarters. Maria Theresa had\r\nemployed the season, which forced her ambitious son to inactivity, in\r\nnew negotiations for peace. Count von Mercy had sought for intervention\r\non the part of France, and Baron Thugut had made new proposals to\r\nPrussia. Until to-day the empress had indulged the hope of terminating\r\nthis unhappy and ridiculous war; but her hopes had been frustrated by\r\nthe dispatches she had just received from France and Bohemia. Count von\r\nMercy wrote that so far from accepting the role of mediator, the French\r\nking expostulated with him upon the injustice of the claims of Austria,\r\nand earnestly recommended their total relinquishment as the only road to\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nAnother courier from Joseph announced that the winter season having\r\nalmost closed, he hoped that he might now be permitted to prosecute the\r\nwar with firmness and vigor. Circumstances were favorable to Austria,\r\nfor General Wurmser had succeeded in surprising the Prince of\r\nPhilippsthal, and in driving the Prussian garrison from their\r\nstronghold. The emperor, therefore, declared his intention of giving\r\nbattle to Frederick, that he might at one stroke free Bohemia from the\r\npresence of a tyrannical and merciless enemy.\r\n\r\nThese were the tidings which had flooded the heart of the empress with\r\nanguish.\r\n\r\n\"I must have peace,\" thought she, as, perfectly unconscious of the fact,\r\nshe still paced the floor of her cabinet. \"I cannot go to my grave\r\nburdened with the crime of an unrighteous war. Peace! peace! Heavenly\r\nFather, send us peace! Something I must do, and that at once; and if my\r\nson still vituperates his unhappy mother, I know that my subjects, the\r\npeople of Germany, and all Europe, will sustain me by their\r\napprobation.\"\r\n\r\nFilled with the idea, she approached her escritoire, and again her eyes\r\nrested upon the papers and pamphlets that lay there. Her cheeks flushed\r\nand her eyes flashed fire, as lifting from the desk a heavy package, she\r\nthrew it down with violence, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\"Has that Schrotter been printing another absurd pamphlet, braying to\r\nthe world of our rights to Bavaria? I must stop that man's mouth, and\r\nteach him discretion!\"\r\n\r\nHere the empress rang and gave two messages to the page who answered the\r\nsummons. \"Let Prince Kaunitz be informed that I would be happy to see\r\nhis highness as soon as possible. Send a messenger to Counsellor von\r\nSchrotter, and let him be here in an hour.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the empress, who at last began to feel that she was\r\nexercising her limbs beyond all power of endurance, sank into an\r\narm-chair and continued her reflections. They were any thing but\r\nconsolatory. She could not humble herself to make any more proposals to\r\nFrederick. He was so arrogant that he might answer in such a way as to\r\nmake war the only alternative for Austria. But where to go for a\r\nmediator? France had refused, and Marie Antoinette had with difficulty\r\nobtained from her husband a promise not to sustain Prussia.\r\n\r\n\"I have a most disobliging son-in-law in Louis,\" thought the empress,\r\n\"and if Marie Antoinette were not in a condition where anxiety of mind\r\nmight be fatal to her life, I should very soon speak plainly to the\r\nking, and let him understand distinctly how little I care for his\r\napproval or disapproval! But I must be patient for my daughter's sake;\r\nand if she gives birth to a dauphin, I shall be too happy to quarrel\r\nwith her stubborn king. I had reckoned upon France, however, and I am\r\ndisappointed and grieved.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the empress bent once more over her papers, and this time she\r\nopened a dispatch from her ambassador at St. Petersburg. She began to\r\nread:\r\n\r\n\"The King of Prussia is asking succor from Russia. The empress is quite\r\nready to grant it, and has already marched an auxiliary force into\r\nGalicia. But she exacts that her troops shall act independently of\r\nFrederick, and requires of him for the prosecution of her war with\r\nTurkey, a subsidy of two million of thalers. The king is indignant at\r\nher exactions, so that the opportunity now offers to dissolve this\r\ndangerous alliance. If the empress-queen could bring herself to pen a\r\nletter to Catharine requesting her intervention--\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" exclaimed Maria Theresa, interrupting herself, \"to such\r\ndegradation I cannot stoop! It would be too base!\" She threw down the\r\nletter, and frowning leaned her head upon her hand. \"How,\" thought she,\r\n\"could a virtuous woman write to that abandoned wretch who degrades the\r\ndivine birthright of royalty by a dissolute life? How could Maria\r\nTheresa so humiliate herself as to ask succor of such a Messalina!\"\r\n\r\nThe entrance of a page interrupted the empress's meditations. His\r\nhighness Prince Kaunitz regretted that he was unable to obey her\r\nmajesty's commands, as he was sick and not able to leave his room.\r\n\r\nThe empress dismissed the page, and frowned anew.\r\n\r\n\"I know perfectly well the nature of his malady,\" thought she. \"Whenever\r\nhe desires to consult with the emperor before seeing me, he falls sick.\r\nWhenever danger is ahead and affairs look stormy he retreats to his hole\r\nlike a discreet fox. I wish to Heaven that I too could take to my bed\r\nand shut my eyes to all that is transpiring around us! But no,\"\r\ncontinued the empress with a pang of self-reproach, \"I have no right to\r\nretire from the post of danger. I must act, and act quickly, or Joseph\r\nwill be before me. Oh, my God, help me in my great need.\"\r\n\r\nShe re-read the dispatches from her different ambassadors, and each one\r\nbreathed the same spirit. From every court in Europe camp disapprobation\r\nand blame. Every one of the great powers counselled peace--speedy peace,\r\nlest all should be drawn into the strife, and Austria left to the\r\nhumiliation of struggling single-handed against every other nation in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe tears of the empress flowed fast. She could see no help on earth,\r\nand how could she feel otherwise than resentful toward the minister and\r\nthe son who had brought her into this mortifying position? Suddenly she\r\ndried her tears and once more took up the dispatch from St. Petersburg.\r\nThe silence in that little room was broken only by her sighs, and the\r\nrustling of the papers which she held in her hand. She paused, and those\r\ntrembling hands fell into her lap. She threw back her head as if trying\r\nto make a difficult resolve.\r\n\r\n\"There is one way--but oh, how disgraceful!\" murmured she. Again the\r\ngathering tears were dashed from her eyes, and she tried to read.\r\n\r\n\"It must be,\" sighed she, as she replaced the paper on the desk; \"and if\r\nso, it must be done quickly. Oh, my Creator! Thou alone knowest how\r\nfearful to my heart is this sacrifice of womanly pride; but thou willest\r\nmy humiliation, and I submit! Let me drink the chalice!\"\r\n\r\nShe took up her pen and began to write. Often she hesitated--threw\r\naside her sheet, and took another. Sometimes she read aloud what she had\r\nwritten; then starting at the sound of the words, resumed her writing in\r\nsilence. At last the task was accomplished, and her eyes scanned the\r\nconcluding paragraph\r\n\r\n\"With the conviction that my honor could be intrusted to no abler hands,\r\nI leave it to your majesty, in conjunction with France, to make such\r\npropositions as you may esteem best calculated to promote peace. In this\r\ntrust I remain,\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty's true and devoted sister,\r\n\r\n\"MARIA THERESA.\" [Footnote: This letter of the empress is yet in the\r\narchives of St. Petersburg. Coxe, who copies it word for word, saw it\r\nthere himself. See Coxe's \"History of the House of Austria,\" vol. iv.,\r\npage 592.]\r\n\r\nAs she read these words, the cheeks of the empress crimsoned with shame,\r\nand, burying her face in her hands, she sobbed aloud. When the paroxysm\r\nof her grief was over, her face was very pale and her eyes dim and\r\nswollen. \"I must complete the humiliation,\" thought she; then folding\r\nthe letter, it was directed \"To Her Majesty the Empress of Russia.\"\r\n\r\nShe took up a tiny gold bell, and ringing it so that it gave out but a\r\nfew strokes, a portiere was raised, and Koch entered the room.\r\n\r\n\"Take a copy of this letter, and send a courier with it to St.\r\nPetersburg. I have at last yielded to the wishes of my counsellors, and\r\nhave written to the Empress of Russia. Peace, Koch--not a word!--my\r\nheart is not yet strong enough to bear the grief and shame of this\r\nhour.\"\r\n\r\nThe private secretary had scarcely left the room, when the page\r\nreentered, announcing Counsellor von Schrotter.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said the empress, \"he comes at the right moment. I am just in the\r\nmood to castigate those who have displeased me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE GRATITUDE OF PRINCES.\r\n\r\nThe message of the empress had been received by Counsellor von Schrotter\r\nwith rapture. His heart throbbed so joyfully that its every beat sent\r\nthe quick blood bounding through his veins. The hour for acknowledgment\r\nof his long-tried services had arrived. For years he had lived a life of\r\nlabor, research, and patient investigation. Among the deeds, parchments,\r\nand dusty green tables of the chancery, his youth had faded to middle\r\nage, and of its early hopes had retained but one single earthly\r\nambition: it was that of taking a place among learned men, and becoming\r\nan authority of some weight in the judicial world. His pamphlets on the\r\nBavarian succession had lifted him to fame, and now among his countrymen\r\nhis name was beginning to be quoted as that of a great and accomplished\r\njurist. Nothing was needed to complete the measure of his simple joys,\r\nsave the approbation of the court, and some acknowledgment on the part\r\nof his sovereign of the fidelity with which he had labored for so many\r\nyears in her behalf.\r\n\r\nThis precious tribute he was called upon to receive. He was to speak\r\nhimself with the Empress of Austria. So excited was he by the thought,\r\nthat the strong man trembled from head to foot; he was even more\r\nagitated than he had been twenty years before, when he had received his\r\ndiploma as doctor of laws. Pale, but inexpressibly happy, he stood upon\r\nthe threshold of the empress's cabinet, and awaited her permission to\r\napproach and kiss her beloved and honored hand.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa saw him and spoke not a word. She sat immovable in her\r\narm-chair, darting lightning glances upon the unconscious counsellor,\r\nand growing every moment more enraged at the thought of his impertinent\r\nresearches, until the storm burst with all its fury upon his head. The\r\nempress clutched the pamphlets which lay near her upon the table, and\r\nrising from her chair, strode through the room to the door where the\r\nunhappy author stood.\r\n\r\n\"Did you write these brochures?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty,\" said Von Schrotter with a happy smile.\r\n\r\n\"Read the title-page.\"\r\n\r\nVon Schrotter read: \"The rights and measures of her imperial, royal, and\r\napostolic majesty in reference to the Bavarian succession.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now read the title of your first pamphlet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impartial thoughts on the various questions arising from the succession\r\nof Maximilian Joseph.\"\r\n\r\n\"You acknowledge the authorship of these two brochures?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am proud to acknowledge them, your majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whence it follows that you are proud to be the cause of the unholy war\r\nwhich now rages throughout Germany,\" said the empress in a voice of\r\nindignation. \"It is you, then, whose pen has metamorphosed itself into a\r\nsword wherewith to take the lives of thousands of good and honest men!\r\nWhat right had you to publish impartial thoughts upon the Bavarian\r\nsuccession? I suppose you had an idea that in so doing, you were\r\nproving to the world what an important part you play in the affairs of\r\nthe nation!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty,\" stammered Von Schrotter, utterly at a loss to understand\r\nhis crime--\"your majesty, through Prince Kaunitz, conveyed to me your\r\nentire satisfaction with my researches into the imperial archives, and\r\nthe emperor himself requested me to write the second pamphlet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am in no wise indebted to you for your complaisance,\" replied the\r\nempress; \"for your ink has changed itself into blood, and your stupid\r\nvagaries, hatched in the comfortable quiet of your own room, have driven\r\nmy poor soldiers from their homes, out into the pitiless storm of\r\nhardship, danger, and death. What right had you to meddle with the\r\ndifficulties of the succession? Did you expect that, in gratitude for\r\nyour valuable services to the crown, I would reward you with a title and\r\nan estate in Bavaria?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty,\" replied Von Schrotter, blushing, I was but doing my\r\nduty as a jurist and civil officer of the crown.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you suppose you have succeeded in proving any thing with your\r\nrubbish?\" asked the empress, scornfully. \"Do you imagine that any one\r\nword take the trouble to read your balderdash?\"\r\n\r\n\"In defending the claims of the crown, I was performing an act of\r\nsacrred duty toward my country,\" replied Von Schrotter, emboldened to\r\nreply, by a just sense of the indignity offered him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I know something of the vanity of authors,\" said the empress.\r\n\"They imagine themselves to be Atlas, each one with the world upon his\r\nshoulders, which must certainly fall, if they are not there to uphold\r\nit. I, however, take the liberty of judging that if they were all to be\r\nblown to atoms, nobody would be the worse for their disappearance. What\r\nhas come of your writings? A paper war of such dimensions, that I think\r\nthe foul fiend must have plucked all the geese in Avernus, and have\r\nthrown their quills at your heads. What with your imbecile pens, nobody\r\nknows who is right!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, your majesty, \"remonstrated Von Schrotter, \"discussion is\r\nindispensable to the discovery of truth, and as I am sure that I have\r\ncontributed to this discovery, I cannot regret what I have done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, indeed!\" exclaimed the enraged empress. \"You think you have\r\ncontributed to the discovery of truth! I will tell you to what you have\r\ncontributed, sir: you are the cause that the emperor became so\r\nheadstrong on the subject, that sooner than give up Bavaria he has\r\ninvolved me in war; you are the cause that the whole world has had\r\nsomething to say on the subject of our claims; whereas, had you held\r\nyour tongue, they might have passed for what they are not--just. You\r\nare the cause that my days are spent in sorrow, and my nights are\r\nsleepless; that in the despair of my heart, I have been reduced to write\r\nto a woman whom I despise! Yes, of all this you are the cause, and more\r\nthan this--you will be guilty of my death; for I repeat to you that this\r\nwar has broken my heart, and will be the last nail in my coffin.\r\n[Footnote: Maria Theresa's own words.] When my people, then, mourn for\r\nmy death (and I hope that they will regret me), you may boast of having\r\ncompassed it yourself; and from my grave I shall arise to--\"\r\n\r\n\"No more, your majesty, no more! Spare me, in mercy,\" sobbed he, \"if you\r\nwould not see me die at your feet!\"\r\n\r\n\"And I presume you would consider it a great misfortune for Austria if\r\nyou were no longer able to unsheathe your goose-quill in her defence.\r\nThere is no danger of your dying from the wounds inflicted by my tongue;\r\nbut I am resolved that you shall carry their marks to the grave with\r\nyou. This is all I had to say to you; you are dismissed.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, your majesty,\" replied Von Schrotter, \"I have something to say--I\r\nmust defend myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must defend yourself!\" cried Maria Theresa, surveying him with a\r\nlook of ineffable disdain. \"Defend yourself to God--I am not disposed to\r\nlisten to your defence.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, your majesty--\"\r\n\r\n\"Peace!\" thundered the empress. \"Who dares speak when I have ordered him\r\nfrom my presence? Go home, and ponder my words.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, she walked back to her seat. But seeing that Von Schrotter's\r\nlips were parted as if in an attempt to say something, she snatched her\r\nbell, and rang it so loud that in its clang his words were lost.\r\n\r\n\"Counsellor Von Schrotter is dismissed,\" said she to the page. \"Open the\r\ndoors, that he may pass.\"\r\n\r\nVon Schrotter gasped out a convulsive sigh, and scarcely knowing what he\r\ndid, turned one last sad look upon his cruel sovereign, and bowing his\r\nhead, left the room.\r\n\r\nWhen his tall, majestic form had disappeared from her sight, the empress\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Ah!--that outburst has done me good. And now that I have driven away\r\nhumiliation by anger, I shall go and pray to God to bless the sacrifice\r\nI have made to-day for the good of my people.\"\r\n\r\nShe rang the bell, assembled her ladies of honor, and with them entered\r\nthe private chapel which had lately been added to her own apartments.\r\nShe knelt before the first prie-Dieu that presented itself, and her\r\nattendants knelt around her.\r\n\r\nWhilst the empress was praying, Von Schrotter returned to the home,\r\nwhich an hour sooner, he had left with a heart so full of hope and\r\necstasy. He had not a word for his old house-keeper, who opened the door\r\nto admit him; and motioning away the servant who would have shown him\r\ninto the dining-room, he ascended the staircase with slow, uncertain\r\nsteps, his hands clinging to the balustrade, his head so heavy that he\r\nscarce could bear its weight. The servants stood below in sorrowful\r\namazement. They had never seen their master so agitated in his life\r\nbefore; they could scarcely believe that this ghastly being was the\r\ndignified and stately man who had left them but an hour before. Suddenly\r\nthey started, for surely they heard a loud laugh from the study, but\r\nwhat a laugh!--so wild, so unearthly, that it sounded like the dreadful\r\nmirth of a madman!--Then all was silent. Presently there came the sound\r\nof a heavy fall.\r\n\r\n\"That is our master! Some misfortune has befallen liim,\" cried the\r\nservants, hurrying up the stairs and bursting into the room. On the\r\nfloor, surrounded by the books which had been the pride and solace of a\r\nharmless life, lay the counsellor weltering in his blood.\r\n\r\n\"He has broken a blood-vessel!\" cried the house-keeper, with a sob,\r\nwhile the other servant ran for a physician. The old woman raised her\r\ndear master's head, and his bloody lips parted with a ghastly smile.\r\n\r\n\"This is the gratitude of princes!\" murmured he almost inaudibly. \"Such\r\nis the reward of him who loves his country!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, my dear, dear master?\" faltered the faithful servant, in\r\nvain seeking to penetrate the meaning of his words. \"Why do you stare at\r\nme so horribly? What has distressed you?\"\r\n\r\nHe moved as though he would have raised his head. \"This is Austria's\r\ngratitude!\" cried he in a loud voice; then, forth from his lips gurgled\r\nthe purple stream of life, and his words died into hoarse, inaudible\r\nmutterings.\r\n\r\nThe physician came in, followed by the valet, and together they raised\r\nthe sufferer and placed him upon his bed. The doctor then felt his pulse\r\nand his chest, and bent down to catch his breathings. He shook his head\r\nmournfully and called to the weeping servants.\r\n\r\n\"He is dying,\" said he. \"Some fearful shock that he has received has\r\ninduced a hemorrhage, which in a few hours will end his life.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa rose from her prayers, comforted and light of heart. And\r\nas she left the chapel, the man whom she had crushed to the earth by her\r\nunjust anger, drew his last sigh. [Footnote: This whole chapter is\r\nhistorical. Hormayer \"Austrian Plutarch,\" vol. vi.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXXX.\r\n\r\nFREDERICK THE GREAT.\r\n\r\nKing Frederick and his Prussians were still encamped at Wildschutz. His\r\narmy was weary of inactivity, and every morning the longing eyes of his\r\nsoldiers turned toward the little gray house at the end of the village\r\nwhere the king and his staff were quartered, vainly hoping to see their\r\nFritz in the saddle, eager, bold, and daring as he had ever been until\r\nnow. The men were destitute of every thing. Not only their food was\r\nexhausted, but their forage also. Bohemia had been plundered until\r\nnothing remained for man or beast. The inhabitants had fled to the\r\ninterior, their villages and farms were a waste, and still the King of\r\nPrussia insisted that his army should subsist upon the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe men were in despair, and the officers began to apprehend a mutiny,\r\nfor the former were surly, and no amount of conciliatory words could\r\nappease their hunger or feed their horses.\r\n\r\n\"We must see the king, we must speak to old Fritz!\" cried the\r\nmalcontents; and with this cry a crowd of artillerymen made their way to\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\n\"We must see the king! Where is old Fritz? Has he ceased to care for his\r\nsoldiers?\" repeated the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"No, friends, I am ready to listen,\" said a soft voice, which,\r\nnevertheless, was heard above the din, and the king, clad in his\r\nwell-known uniform, appeared at the window.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers received him with, a cheer, and at the sight of the\r\nwell-beloved countenance, they forgot their need, and shouted for joy.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" said Frederick, when the tumult had died away.\r\n\r\nOne of the men, as spokesman, stepped forward. \"We wanted to see our old\r\nFritz once more; we can scarcely believe that he sees our wants and yet\r\nwill do nothing to relieve them.\" \"You see mine,\" said Frederick,\r\nsmiling, \"and, as you perceive, I am scarcely better off than\r\nyourselves. Do you think this a fit residence for a king?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a dog-kennel!\" cried the soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"And is that all you have to say to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sire, it is not. If our king can do nothing for us, at least let\r\nhim rescue our horses from starvation. We are men, and our reason helps\r\nus to bear privations; but it is a sin to keep our horses here without\r\nfood. We beseech your majesty, give us forage for our horses!\" And the\r\nothers repeated in chorus; \"Forage, forage, give us forage for our\r\nhorses!\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the king had closed his window and had retired to the other\r\nend of his house. This made the soldiers frantic, and they screamed and\r\nshouted louder than ever\r\n\r\n\"Give us forage for our horses!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly the voice which had so often led them to victory, was heard at\r\nthe door\r\n\r\n\"Peace, you noisy rebels, peace, I say!\"\r\n\r\nAnd on the steps before his wretched cabin, stood Frederick, surrounded\r\nby the principal officers of his army.\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" said one of the king's staff, \"shall we disperse them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why-so?\" replied Frederick, curtly. \"Have my poor soldiers not the\r\nright to appeal to me for help? Speak, my children, speak without fear!\"\r\n\"Forage, sire, forage--our horses are dying like flies!\"\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said the king to his officers, \"these poor fellows ask\r\nnothing for themselves. Why is it that they have no forage for their\r\nhorses?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" replied the officers, deprecatingly, \"as long as there remained\r\na hay-stack or a storehouse in this part of Bohemia, your majesty's army\r\nwas fed by the enemy. But the country is stripped of every thing. The\r\ninhabitants themselves have been obliged to fly from starvation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Starvation!\" echoed the king. \"I will warrant that, while the horses of\r\nthe privates are suffering for food, those of the officers are well\r\nprovided.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not interrupt me, but let all the forage belonging to the chief\r\nofficers of the army be brought at once, and placed before these men.\r\nThey can wait here until it comes, and then divide it between them. Are\r\nyou satisfied, my children?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" cried the men, shouting for joy at the prospect of the\r\nabundance about to be vouchsafed to them.\r\n\r\nThe officers, on the contrary, were deeply humiliated, and beheld the\r\nproceedings with gloomy discontent.\r\n\r\nFrederick pretended not to perceive their dissatisfaction. He stood with\r\nhis hat drawn down over his brows, leaning for support upon the\r\ncrutch-cane which, of late, had been his inseparable companion.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, when a soldier came up with his bundle of hay, the king\r\nglanced quickly around, and then looked down again. The artillerymen\r\ngradually ceased their noisy demonstrations, and now, with anxious,\r\nexpectant faces, they looked at the king, the officers, and then at the\r\nvery small amount of forage which was being placed before them.\r\n\r\nJust then an adjutant bowed to the king, and announced that the last\r\nbundle of hay had been set before his majesty.\r\n\r\nFrederick raised his eyes, and sadly contemplated the miserable little\r\nheap of forage which betokened with so much significance the destitution\r\nof his brave army.\r\n\r\n\"Is this all?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire, all--\"\r\n\r\n\"It is well. Now,\" continued he to the artillerymen, \"divide this\r\nbetween you. Had my officers been more selfish, your horses would have\r\nfared better. But you see that my generals and adjutants are as noble\r\nand self-sacrificing as yourselves; and unless you manage to forage for\r\nus all, we shall all starve together. I have called for this hay to\r\nprove to you that your officers were not revelling in plenty while you\r\nwere suffering for want. Take it, and do not ask for that which I cannot\r\ngive you.\"\r\n\r\nThe artillerymen looked almost ashamed of their clamor, while the faces\r\nof the officers brightened, and their eyes turned with love and\r\nadmiration upon the man whose tact had so entirely justified them to\r\ntheir men.\r\n\r\nThe king pretended to see their delight as little as he had feigned to\r\nsee their mortification. He seemed wholly absorbed watching the\r\nsoldiers, who were now striving together as to who was to have the\r\nremnants of forage that was far from being enough to allow each man a\r\nbundle. [Footnote: Dohm's Memoirs, vol. i., p. 158.]\r\n\r\nFinally Frederick withdrew to his cabin, and, once alone, he fell into\r\nthe leathern arm-chair which was the only piece of furniture in the room\r\nbesides a bed and a table.\r\n\r\n\"This will never do,\" thought he, sorrowfully. \"We must either retreat\r\nor advance. This war is a miserable failure--the impotent effort of a\r\nshattered old man whose head is powerless to plan, and his hand to\r\nexecute. How often since I entered upon this farcical campaign, have I\r\nrepeated those words of Boileau:\r\n\r\n`Malheureux, laisse en paix ton cheval vicillissant De peur quo tout a\r\ncoup essoufle, sans haleine, Il ne laisse en tombant, son maitre sur\r\nl'arbne.' [Footnote: Frederick's own words.]\r\n\r\n\"Why did I undertake this war? Why had I not discretion enough to remain\r\nat home, and secure the happiness of my own people?\"\r\n\r\nThe king sighed, and his head sank upon his breast. He sat thus for some\r\ntime in deep discouragement; but presently he repeated to himself:\r\n\r\n\"Why did I undertake this war--why?\" echoed he aloud. \"For the honor and\r\nsafety of Germany. How sorely soever war may press upon my age and\r\ninfirmities, it is my duty to check the ambition of a house whose greed\r\nhas no bounds, save those which are made for it by the resistance of\r\nanother power as resolute as itself. I am, therefore, the champion of\r\nGerman liberties, and cannot, must not sheathe my sword. But this\r\ninactivity is demoralizing my army, and it must come to an end. We must\r\nretreat or advance--then let us advance!\"\r\n\r\nHere the king rang his bell. A valet entered, whom he ordered to go at\r\nonce to the generals and staff-officers and bid them assemble at\r\nheadquarters in fifteen minutes from that time.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the king, \"we cross the Elbe to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words every countenance there grew bright, and every voice was\r\nraised in one long shout:\r\n\r\n\"Long live the king! Long live Frederick the Great!\"\r\n\r\nThe king tried his best to look unmoved.\r\n\r\n\"Peace! peace! you silly, old fellows,\" said he. \"What do you suppose\r\nthe boys will do out there, if you raise such a clamor indoors? Do you\r\napprove of the move? Speak, General Keller.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, while out on a reconnaissance yesterday, I discovered a crossing\r\nwhere we may go safely over, without danger from the enemy's bullets.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. Are you all of one mind?\"\r\n\r\nA long shout was the answer, and when it had subsided, the king smiled\r\ngrimly and nodded his head.\r\n\r\n\"We are all of one mind, then. To-morrow we engage the enemy. And now to\r\nhorse! We must reconnoitre the position which General Keller has chosen,\r\nand part of our troops must cross to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXXXI,\r\n\r\n\"THE DARKEST HOUR IS BEFORE DAY.\"\r\n\r\nA few moments later the officers were mounted, and the king's horse\r\nstood before his door. Frederick, coming forward, with something of his\r\nyouthful elasticity, tried to raise himself in the saddle; but he\r\nstopped, and with an expression of great suffering withdrew his foot\r\nfrom the stirrup.\r\n\r\nThe old hero had forgotten that the gout was holding him prisoner. His\r\nface flushed with disappointment, as he called his lackeys to his help.\r\nBut once in the saddle, the king struck his spurs with such violence\r\ninto his horse's flanks, that the animal leaped into the air, and\r\nbounded off in a swift gallop.\r\n\r\nWhether Frederick had intended to prove to his officers that he was as\r\nbold a horseman as ever, or whether be had yielded to a momentary\r\nimpulse of anger, he suffered keenly for his bravado; for at every bound\r\nof the horse, his agony increased. Finally he could endure no more. He\r\ncame to a complete stand, and requested his suite to slacken their pace.\r\nThey rode on in perfect silence, the officers casting stolen glances at\r\nthe king, whose lips quivered, while his face grew every moment paler\r\nwith suppressed anguish. But he bore it all without a sigh, until they\r\nhad reached the point for which they started. Having accurately surveyed\r\nit, Frederick turned his horse's head, and rode back to his quarters.\r\n\r\nThis time he had not only to be lifted from his horse, but to be carried\r\nto his room. Once there, he signed to his attendants to leave him. He\r\nfelt the imperious necessity of being alone with his afflicted mind and\r\nbody. He leaned his head back, and murmured\r\n\r\n\"Malheureux, laisse en paux ton cheval vieillissant!\"\r\n\r\nThen, closing his eyes, he quoted the sacred Scriptures for the first\r\ntime in his life without irreverent intention.\r\n\r\n\"The spirit is willing,\" sighed the wretched unbeliever, \"but the flesh\r\nis weak.\"\r\n\r\nHe remained pondering over those truthful words for several moments;\r\nthen casting his eyes over the various objects that lay upon his table,\r\nthey lit upon the little leather-covered box, which contained his flute.\r\nFor some time past his perplexities had been so great that he had held\r\nno intercourse with this object of his life-long affection; but now he\r\nfelt as if its tones would be consolatory. And with trembling, eager\r\nhands he unfastened the case, and raised the instrument to his lips. But\r\nalas! the flute, like its adorer, was superannuated. Wearily came its\r\nfeeble notes upon the air, each one hoarse as the wind whistling through\r\na ruined abbey. [Footnote: It was during the war of the Bavarian\r\nSuccession that Frederick found himself compelled to give up the flute.\r\nHis embouchure had been destroyed by the loss of his front teeth, and\r\nhis hands trembled so that he could scarcely hold the instrument.]\r\n\r\nFrederick had played but a few bars of his adagio when his hands fell\r\nslowly, and the flute rolled upon the table. He contemplated it for\r\nawhile, then his eyes filled with tears, which fell rapidly down his\r\ncheeks. A mournful smile flickered over his countenance.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, in a low voice, \"I suppose there is nothing disgraceful\r\nin the tears of an old man over the last, faithful friend of his youth.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words he replaced the flute in the case, and locked it,\r\nmurmuring:\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, forever, my life-long solace!\"\r\n\r\nJust then, a thousand voices shouted:\r\n\r\n\"Long live the king! Long live old Fritz!\"\r\n\r\n\"They are rejoicing over the approaching battle,\" thought Frederick.\r\n\"But their hopes, like mine, are destined to be crushed. Instead of\r\ncrossing the Elbe, we must retire to Silesia. Old age has vanquished\r\nme--and from such a defeat no man can ever rally.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well! We must take the world as it comes, and if I can neither\r\nlight nor play on the flute, I can still talk and write. My eulogy on\r\nVoltaire is not yet completed--I must finish it to-day, that it may be\r\nread before the Academy at Berlin, on the anniversary of his death.\"\r\n[Footnote: Voltaire died in May, 1779 and Frederick, while in camp in\r\nBohemia, wrote a poem on his death.]\r\n\r\nSelecting from among his papers the manuscript he wanted, Frederick took\r\nup his pen and began to write.\r\n\r\nGradually the songs and shouts of the soldiers ceased, and the king was\r\nconsoling himself for the loss of music by flinging himself into the\r\narms of poetry, when a knock was heard at his door, and his valet\r\nannounced the secretary of Count Gallitzin.\r\n\r\nFrederick's heart throbbed with joy, and his great eagle eyes were so\r\nstrangely lit up, that the valet could not imagine what had caused such\r\nan illumination of his royal master's features.\r\n\r\n\"Thugut,\" cried the king; \"is Thugut here again? Admit him immediately.\"\r\n\r\nBy the time that Baron Thugut had appeared at the door, Frederick had so\r\nforced down his joy, that he received the envoy of the empress-queen\r\nwith creditable indifference.\r\n\r\n\"Well, baron,\" said he, with a careless nod, \"you come again. When the\r\nfoul fiend comes for the third time, he must either bag a man's soul, or\r\ngive it up forever.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel flattered, sire, by the comparison your majesty makes of me to\r\nso great and powerful a potentate,\" replied the baron, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"You believe in the devil, then, although you deny the Lord.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, sire, for I have never yet seen a trace of the one, and the\r\nother I meet everywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"For an ambassador of Maria Theresa, your opinions are tolerably\r\nheterodox,\" said Frederick. \"But tell me what brings you hither? You\r\nmust not expect me to continue our interrupted negotiations. If the\r\nempress-queen sends you to claim ever so small a portion of Bavaria, I\r\ntell you, beforehand, that it is useless to say a word. Austria must\r\nrenounce her pretensions or continue the war.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, I come with new propositions. Here are my credentials, if your\r\nmajesty is at leisure to examine them, and here is a letter from the\r\nhand of my revered sovereign.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is that?\" asked Frederick, pointing to a roll of papers, tied\r\nup with twine.\r\n\r\n\"Those are my documents, together with the papers relating to the past\r\nnegotiations.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that I have already refused to go over these negotiations,\"\r\nsaid Frederick, sharply; and without further ceremony, he broke the seal\r\nof the empress's letter. While the king read, Thugut busied himself\r\nuntying his roll and spreading his papers out upon the table.\r\n\r\n\"This is nothing but a letter of credentials,\" observed the king,\r\nputting it down. \"The empress refers me to you for verbal explanations.\r\nI am ready to hear them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, the empress-queen, animated by a heartfelt desire to restore\r\npeace to Germany, has called upon France and Russia to settle the\r\ndifficulties which, to her sincere regret, have arisen between herself\r\nand your majesty. These two powers, having responded favorably to my\r\nsovereign's request--\"\r\n\r\n\"Say, rather,\" interrupted Frederick, \"that these two powers having\r\ngiven to her majesty of Austria the somewhat peremptory advice to\r\nrelinquish her pretensions to Bavaria--\"\r\n\r\nBaron Thugut bowed, and resumed: \"That the two powers may have the\r\nopportunity of conducting their negotiations without any new\r\ncomplications from military movements, her majesty, the empress,\r\nproposes an armistice, to begin from to-day.\"\r\n\r\nUp to this moment the king's eyes had been fixed upon Thugut; but as he\r\nheard these few last words, he dropped them suddenly. He was so\r\noverjoyed, that he was afraid to betray his raptures to the diplomatist.\r\nHe recovered himself in time. \"Did you come through my camp?\" said he to\r\nthe baron.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire.\"\r\n\r\n\"You heard the, shouts and songs of my brave Prussians. Were you told\r\nthat I intend to cross the Elbe, and offer battle to your emperor\r\nto-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire, I was told so.\"\r\n\r\n\"And at the very moment when I am prepared to fight, you come to me with\r\nproposals of armistice! You perceive that I could only be brought to\r\nconsent to a truce through my consideration for the empress, provided\r\nshe offered sound guaranties for the conclusion of an honorable peace.\r\nLet us hear your proposals.\"\r\n\r\nThe interview between the king and the secret envoy of the empress was\r\nlong and animated. When the latter was about to take leave, Frederick\r\nnodded condescendingly, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Well! I consent to make this sacrifice to the wishes of the empress.\r\nYou can inform her, that instead of giving battle to the emperor, as I\r\nhad hoped to do on the morrow, I shall retreat to Silesia, and retire\r\ninto winter quarters.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your majesty promises equitable conditions, and will consult with\r\nthe Russian ambassador?\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise, and the empress-queen may rely upon me. Farewell.\" The envoy\r\nturned to depart, but before he reached the door the king called him\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\"Baron,\" said he with a significant smile, \"you have forgotten\r\nsomething.\" Here he pointed to the twine which had fallen on the floor,\r\nand lay near the baron's chair. \"Take what belongs to you; I never\r\nenrich myself with the possessions of others.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the door closed, the king raised his eyes to heaven. \"Is it chance,\r\nor Providence, that has succored me to-day?\" thought he. \"Which of the\r\ntwo has vouchsafed me such honorable deliverance in my extremity?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXXXII.\r\n\r\nTHE EMPEROR AND HIS MOTHER.\r\n\r\nIt was a day of double rejoicing in Vienna, at once the celebration of\r\npeace, and of Maria Theresa's sixty-second birthday. For three months\r\nthe seven envoys of Austria, Prussia, Russia, France, Bavaria,\r\nZweibrucken, and Saxony, had been disentangling the threads of the\r\nBavarian succession. For three months Joseph had hoped and prayed that\r\nthe debates of the peace congress might come to naught, and its\r\ndeliberations engender a veritable war. But he was destined to new\r\ndisappointment. The love of peace had prevailed. Austria had renounced\r\nall her inheritance in Bavaria, save the Innviertel, and had declared\r\nher treaty with Charles Theodore to be null and void.\r\n\r\nThe people of Vienna were overjoyed. They, like their empress, preferred\r\npeace to increase of domain; and they hastened to offer her their\r\nsincerest congratulations. All the European ambassadors were in full\r\nuniform, and Maria Theresa was seated on a throne, in all her imperial\r\nregalia.\r\n\r\nShe was radiant with smiles, and happiness flashed from her still bright\r\neyes; but on this day of rejoicing there was one void that pained the\r\nempress--it was the absence of her eldest son. Since his return to\r\nVienna, three months before, there had never yet been a word of\r\nexplanation between Joseph and his mother. He had studiously avoided\r\nbeing alone with her, had never made his appearance in council, and when\r\ndocuments had been presented to him for signature, he had no sooner\r\nperceived the sign-manual of the empress, than he had added his own\r\nwithout examination or comment.\r\n\r\nIt was this cold submission which tortured the heart of Maria Theresa.\r\nShe would have preferred recrimination to such compliance as this; it\r\nseemed so like aversion, so like despair!\r\n\r\nWhen the ceremonies of the day were over, the empress sent a messenger\r\nto request the presence of her son, in her own private apartments. The\r\nmessenger returned, and a few moments after, was followed by the\r\nemperor.\r\n\r\nHe entered the room, and his mother came eagerly forward, her two hands\r\noutstretched to greet him. \"Thank you, my dearest child,\" said she,\r\naffectionately, \"for coming so promptly at my request. My heart has been\r\nyearning for my son, and I have longed all day to see my co-regent and\r\nemperor at my side.\"\r\n\r\nShe still held out her hands, but Joseph, affecting not to see them,\r\nbowed with grave ceremony. \"I am neither emperor nor co-regent,\" replied\r\nhe; \"I am but the son and subject of the empress, and as such I have\r\nalready congratulated your majesty with the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were your congratulations for my birthday, or for the restoration of\r\npeace, my son?\"\r\n\r\n\"The birthday of my empress is, above all others, a day of gratulation\r\nfor you,\" replied Joseph, evasively.\r\n\r\n\"Then peace is not agreeable to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, I have every reason to be satisfied. Have we not exchanged\r\ncompliments with all the powers of Europe, and have not the people of\r\nVienna sung ninety-nine thousand TE DEUMS in honor of the peace of\r\nTeschen?\" [Footnote: Joseph's own words.]\r\n\r\n\"I see that you do not approve of it, Joseph,\" said the empress, who was\r\nanxious to come to an understanding on the subject.\r\n\r\n\"I was under the impression that I had signed all your majesty's acts\r\nwithout giving any trouble whatever,\" was the cold reply.\r\n\r\n\"But you did it unwillingly, I fear, and thought of your mother as a\r\nweak and timid old woman. Is it not so, my son?\"\r\n\r\n\"When I signed the treaty I thought of my ancestor, Charles V. After a\r\ndisastrous campaign in Africa, he was obliged to return with his fleet\r\nto Spain. He sailed, it is true, but he was the last man to go on board.\r\nSo with me--I signed the articles of peace, but was the last one who\r\nsigned.\" [Footnote: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n\"Have you nothing more to say on the subject? Are you not glad that\r\nthere is to be no bloodshed?\"\r\n\r\n\"A son and subject has no right to sit in judgment upon the actions of\r\nhis mother and empress.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are more than a subject, you are an emperor.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty; I am like the Venetian generals. In war, they\r\ncommanded the armies, and received their salaries from the republic.\r\nWhen their campaigns were over, their pensions were paid and they sank\r\nback into obscurity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my son, these are hard and bitter words,\" exclaimed the empress,\r\npressing her hands upon her heart. \"I see plainly that you are\r\ndispleased because I have exchanged a doubtful war for an honorable\r\npeace.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not so presuming as to be displeased with your majesty's acts, and\r\nif you have obtained an honorable peace, I wish you joy of it.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa sighed heavily. \"I perceive,\" said she, disconsolately,\r\n\"that you are resolved not to let me see into your heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, your majesty,\" cried Joseph, with a bitter smile, \"I have no heart.\r\nWhere my heart once was, there stands an open grave, and, one by one, my\r\nhopes have all been buried there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it strange that the future Emperor of Austria should speak of\r\nburied hopes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I said nothing of an emperor, your majesty, I spoke of poor Joseph of\r\nHapsburg and of his personal wishes. As regards the future emperor, he\r\nof course has many hopes for Austria. First among them is the wish that\r\nthe epoch of his reign may be very far off! Second, is his desire to\r\nserve his country. As we are now to enjoy the blessings of peace, and I\r\nam on the list of your majesty's pensioned officers, I should like, if\r\nit do not conflict with your views, to receive an appointment as\r\nminister to some foreign power.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" exclaimed Maria Theresa, sorrowfully, \"would you leave me so soon\r\nagain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty, I desire a long leave of absence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whither would you then journey, my dear child?\"\r\n\r\n\"I desire to visit the Empress Catharine.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Empress Catharine!\" echoed Maria Theresa, starting and coloring\r\nviolently. \"You would visit that woman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty. I would visit that woman as Baron Thugut did the\r\nKing of Prussia; with this exception, that I do not go secretly--I first\r\nconsult your majesty.\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa would not notice this thrust of her son. She contented\r\nherself with replying: \"What object can you have in going on a mission\r\nto Russia?\"\r\n\r\n\"I propose to win the friendship of the empress.\"\r\n\r\n\"The friendship of that degraded woman! I do not covet it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet your majesty was the first to request her mediation in our\r\naffairs with Germany. As you have raised the foul fiend, and he has come\r\nat your call, you must abide the consequences, and accept him as a\r\nfriend. Since Russia is to have a voice in German politics, it is better\r\nthat she speak for us, than sustain our enemy, Prussia.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she has long been the ally of Prussia,\" objected the empress.\r\n\r\n\"So much the more incumbent is it upon us to disturb the alliance. To do\r\nthis, is the purpose of my journey to Russia. I repeat my request for\r\nyour majesty's consent.\"\r\n\r\nFor some moments Maria Theresa contemplated her son with inexpressible\r\ntenderness. At length she said with a sigh, \"You really desire, then, to\r\ngo to Russia?\"\r\n\r\n\"Such is my wish, your majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my child, since you desire it, I consent; but I do it\r\nunwillingly. I wish to prove to my son how gladly I gratify him, when I\r\ncan do so without conflicting with my duties as a sovereign.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor bowed, but spoke not a word. Maria Theresa sighed again, and\r\nan expression of deep pain crossed her face.\r\n\r\n\"When do you expect to start?\" said she, sadly.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as possible; for if I am not mistaken, the time is now\r\npropitious for stepping in between Prussia and her beloved ally.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I am to lose my dear son at once?\" asked the mother, with tearful\r\neyes. \"I fear he leaves me without a pang; and will seldom bestow a\r\nthought upon the mother whose anxious heart follows his every movement\r\nwith love.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall bestow my thoughts upon my sovereign, and remember that I am\r\npledged to obtain for her a powerful ally. But I have much to do before\r\nI start. Above all things I must see Prince Kaunitz. I beg therefore of\r\nyour majesty the permission to retire.\"\r\n\r\n\"As the emperor pleases,\" said Maria Theresa, with quivering lip.\r\n\r\nJoseph bowed, and without a word or look at his mother's sorrowing\r\ncountenance, turned toward the door. Up to this moment the empress had\r\ncontrolled her distress, but she could master her grief no longer. She\r\nlooked at the emperor with dimmed eyes and throbbing heart; and in the\r\nextremity of her maternal anguish, she cried out,\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my son, my precious boy!\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor, who was opening the door, turned around. He saw his mother,\r\nher tears falling like rain, standing close by with outstretched arms.\r\nBut he did not respond to the appeal. With another ceremonious bow, he\r\nsaid, \"I take leave of your majesty.\" and closed the door behind him.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa uttered aloud cry and sank to the floor. \"Oh,\" sobbed she,\r\n\"I am a poor, desolate mother. My child loves me no longer!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXXXIII.\r\n\r\nPRINCE POTEMKIN.\r\n\r\nPrince Potemkin was just out of bed. In front of him, two pages, richly\r\ndressed, bowed down to the floor as they opened the door for him to pass\r\ninto his cabinet. Behind him, two more pages held up the train of his\r\nvelvet dressing-gown, which, all bedecked with jewels, came trailing\r\nbehind his tall, graceful figure. Behind the pages were four valets with\r\nbreakfast and Turkish pipes.\r\n\r\nAnd in this wise Prince Potemkin entered his cabinet. He threw himself\r\nupon an ottoman covered with India cashmere shawls, and received from a\r\nkneeling page a cup of chocolate, which was handed to his highness upon\r\na gold waiter set with pearls. Then, as if the cup had been too\r\ntroublesome to hold, he replaced it on the waiter, and ordered the page\r\nto pour the chocolate down.\r\n\r\nThe page, apparently, was accustomed to the order, for he rose briskly\r\nfrom his knees, and approaching the cup to Potemkin's lips, allowed the\r\nchocolate to trickle slowly down his princely throat. Meanwhile the\r\nthree pages, four valets, and six officers, who had been awaiting him in\r\nhis cabinet, stood around in stiff, military attitudes, each one\r\nuncomfortably conscious that he was momentarily exposed to the possible\r\ndispleasure of the mighty favorite of the mighty Czarina.\r\n\r\nPotemkin, meanwhile, vouchsafed not a look at any one of them. After he\r\nhad sipped his chocolate, and the page had dried his mouth with an\r\nembroidered napkin, he opened his lips. The valet whose duty it was to\r\npresent it, stepped forward with the Turkish pipe, and depositing its\r\nmagnificent golden bowl upon the Persian carpet by the ottoman, placed\r\nthe amber mouth-piece between the lips of his master.\r\n\r\nAgain a dead silence; and again those stiff forms stood reverentially\r\naround, while Potemkin, with an air of ennui and satiety, watched the\r\nblue wreaths that rose from his pipe to the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\"What o'clock is it?\" asked he moodily.\r\n\r\n\"Mid-day, your highness,\" was the prompt reply.\r\n\r\n\"How many people in the anteroom?\"\r\n\r\n\"A multitude of nobles, generals, and lesser petitioners, all awaiting\r\nyour highness's appearance.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long have they been there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three hours, your highness.\"\r\n\r\nHis highness went on smoking, impelled probably by the reflection that\r\nthree hours was too short a time for the court of Russia to wait for the\r\nineffable blessing of his presence.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he became weary of the pipe, and raised his head. Three\r\nvalets rushed forward, each with an embroidered suit, to inquire whether\r\nhis highness would wear the uniform of a field-marshal, that of a\r\nlord-chamberlain, or the magnificent costume of a Russian prince.\r\nPotemkin waved them off, and rose from the ottoman. His long brown hair,\r\nwhich flowed like the mane of a lion around his handsome face, bore here\r\nand there the traces of the down pillow upon which he had slept; his\r\nopen dressing-gown exposed to view his slovenly undergarments; and his\r\npearl-embroidered slippers were worn over a pair of soiled stockings\r\nwhich, hanging loosely around his legs, revealed his powerful and\r\nwell-shaped calves.\r\n\r\nIn this neglige, Potemkin approached the door of his anteroom. As soon\r\nas he had been announced, a hundred weary faces grew bright with\r\nexpectation; and princes, dukes, and nobles bowed before the haughty man\r\nwho was even mightier than the empress; for HE bent before no mortal,\r\nwhile she was the slave of one will--of Potemkin's.\r\n\r\nSilent and disdainful, Potemkin walked through the lines of obsequious\r\ncourtiers that fell back as he passed, here and there condescending to\r\ngreet some nobleman of wealth or influence. As for the others who raised\r\ntheir imploring eyes to his, he affected not to know of their\r\ninsignificant presence, and returned to his cabinet without having\r\nvouchsafed a word to anybody.\r\n\r\n\"Is the jeweller there?\" asked he of the officer at the door, and as the\r\nlatter bowed his head, Potemkin added, \"Admit him, and after him the\r\nminister of police.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words he passed into his cabinet, and his valets began to\r\ndress him. While his long mane was being combed into order, Potemkin\r\namused himself playing like a juggler with three little golden balls,\r\nwhile the pale and trembling jeweller stood wondering what new robbery\r\nawaited him now.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Artankopf, you are there?\" said the prince, when his toilet had\r\nbeen completed. \"I have an order for you.\"\r\n\r\nThe jeweller made a salam, and muttered some unintelligible words of\r\nwhich Potemkin took no notice.\r\n\r\n\"I saw a magnificent service of gold yesterday in your showcase.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is an order, your highness,\" said Artankopf, quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Then I cannot buy it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible, your highness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I order one exactly like it, above all in weight. The statuettes\r\nwhich ornament that service are exquisitely moulded. How much gold is\r\nthere in it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sixty thousand rubles, your highness.\"\r\n\r\nPotemkin's eyes sparkled. \"A considerable sum,\" said he, stroking his\r\nmane. \"I order two services of the same value. Do you hear? They must be\r\nready on this day week.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the payment?\" Artankopf ventured to inquire.\r\n\r\n\"I shall pay you in advance,\" replied Potemkin, with a laugh. \"I appoint\r\nyou first court-jeweller to the empress.\"\r\n\r\nThe jeweller did not appear to appreciate the mode of payment; he seemed\r\nterrified.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, your highness,\" said he, trembling, \"I implore you not to make such\r\nfearful jests. I am the father of a large family, and if you exact of me\r\nto furnish you a service worth a fortune, the outlay for the gold alone\r\nwill ruin me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will be irretrievably ruined if you do not furnish it,\" laughed\r\nPotemkin, while he went on throwing his balls and catching them \"If\r\nthose two services are not here on the day you take a journey to\r\nSiberia, friend Artankopf.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will be punctual, your highness,\" sighed the jeweller. \"But the\r\npayment--I must buy the gold.\"\r\n\r\n\"The payment! What, the devil--you are not paid by the appointment I\r\ngive you! Go: and if you venture to murmur, think of Siberia, and that\r\nwill cure your grief.\"\r\n\r\nWith a wave of his hand, Potemkin dismissed the unhappy jeweller, who\r\nleft that princely den of extortion a broken-hearted, ruined man.\r\n\r\nThe robber, meanwhile, was counting his gains and donning his\r\nfield-marshal's uniform. \"One hundred and twenty thousand rubles' worth\r\nof gold!\" said he to himself. \"I'll have the things melted into coin--it\r\nis more portable than plate.\"\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and Narischkin, the minister of police, entered.\r\n\r\n\"Out, the whole gang of you!\" cried Potemkin; and there was a\r\nsimultaneous exodus of officers, pages, and valets. When the heavy,\r\ngold-bordered silken portiere had fallen, the tyrant spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Now let us hear your report,\" said he, seating himself before his\r\ntoilet-mirror, where first he cleaned his dazzling white teeth, and then\r\npared his nails.\r\n\r\nThe minister of police, in an attitude of profound respect, began to go\r\nover the occurrences of the past two days in St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nPotemkin listened with an occasional yawn, and finally interrupted\r\nhim. \"You are an old fool. What do I care for your burglars and\r\nbankrupts! You have not so much as a murder to relate to me. Can you not\r\nguess that there are other things of which I wish to hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless your highness wishes me to report the doings of the Emperor\r\nof Austria.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not quite such a dunce, then, as you seem to be. Well, what has\r\nthe emperor been about these two days past?\"\r\n\r\n\"He leads the same life as he did in Moscow,\" said Narischkin. \"He goes\r\nabout as Count Falkenstein.\"\r\n\r\n\"He comes as his own ambassador,\" cried Potemkin, laughing, \"and he\r\ncould not have chosen a worse one than Count Falkenstein. [Footnote:\r\nPotemkin's own words.] What a wretched country Austria must be when its\r\nemperor travels about like an ordinary Russian gentleman!\"\r\n\r\n\"He arrived in St. Petersburg with one servant carrying his portmanteau,\r\nand engaged two rooms at a hotel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. I have heard of his passion for living at hotels. It all\r\nproceeds from avarice. Were he the guest of the empress, he would be\r\nobliged to make some imperial presents here and there. When our great\r\nczarina invited him to Sarskoe-Selo, he accepted, on condition that he\r\nshould be allowed to lodge at an inn. Now there happens to be no inn at\r\nSarskoe-Selo; so the imperial gardener has hung out a sign, and the\r\nlittle Count of Falkenstein is to take up his lodging with him. He never\r\nwill be the wiser, and will fancy himself at an inn. So that in trifles,\r\nas in matters of state, the czarina shall befool Austria, and lead him\r\nby the nose. Tell me something more of his eccentricities. Have you\r\ndazzled him with a sight of our wealth?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is not to be dazzled, your highness. Even the homage he has received\r\nseems to give him no pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Has he, then, been the object of so much consideration?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her majesty ordered it, and she has even devised some delicate\r\ncompliments wherewith to surprise him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!--she seems to be inclined toward this little emperor,\" muttered\r\nPotemkin. \"She indulges in fanciful projects of aggrandizement with him,\r\nand forgets--Well--what were the surprises which the czarina prepared\r\nfor his countship?\"\r\n\r\n\"Day before yesterday, he visited the Academy of Sciences. An atlas was\r\npresented to him; and when he opened it, he found a map of his own\r\njourney from Vienna to St. Petersburg, with engravings illustrating the\r\nvarious details of the journey.\" [Footnote: Theodore Mundl, \"Conflicts\r\nfor the Black Sea,\" p. 141]\r\n\r\n\"Pretty good,\" sneered Potemkin, \"but unfortunately not original, for\r\nthe little count received a similar compliment in Paris. Go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the emperor visited the Academy of Arts, and there he found a\r\nportfolio of engravings, among which was an excellent portrait of\r\nhimself with this inscription: 'Multorum providus urbes et mores\r\nhonaivum inspexit.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Who wrote the inscription?\" asked Potemkin, hastily.\r\n\r\n\"Her majesty's self,\" replied Narischkin, with a deep inclination at the\r\nname. \"But the emperor greets every thing with a quiet smile. When he\r\nvisited the mint and saw the enormous piles of bullion there, he merely\r\nsaid: 'Have you always as much silver in the mint as there is to-day?'\"\r\n\r\nPotemkin laughed aloud. \"That was a sly question, and shows that little\r\nFalkenstein has been peeping behind the scenes and has discovered that\r\nwe were prepared for his coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your highness. It would appear that Count Falkenstein does not\r\nquite believe in our enormous wealth; for after seeing the mint, he put\r\non that mocking smile of his, and asked whether the Imperial Bank was in\r\na condition to redeem its issue.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was the answer?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Yes,' of course, your highness.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a masterpiece of effrontery then, and I shall take the\r\nopportunity of testing its truth. Go to the bank, Narischkin, and say\r\nthat I need one hundred thousand rubles for an entertainment I propose\r\nto give to the czarina. I must have it in coin. Quick--begone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fly, your highness, but first be so kind as to give me the imperial\r\norder. You well know that no coin can leave the bank without the\r\nsignature of the empress.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like to see whether they will dare to return MY signature,\"\r\ncried Potemkin, fiercely.\r\n\r\nHe wrote the order, and handing it to Narischkin, said: \"Take this to\r\nthe bank directors; and if they ask for the signature of the empress,\r\ntell them she will send it to-morrow, but I must have the money to-day.\"\r\n\r\nNarischkin bowed lower than he had ever been seen to do toward the son\r\nof the empress himself, and left the room on reverential tiptoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXXXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE PRUSSIAN AMBASSADOR.\r\n\r\nWhen Potemkin felt himself quite alone, he leaned back in his arm-chair\r\nwith an ugly frown.\r\n\r\n\"Something is going on to my disadvantage here,\" muttered he. \"I saw it\r\nyesterday in Panin's exulting countenance.. How I hate that man! Almost\r\nas much as I do Orloff! It is a blessing for me that both are not here\r\nto plot together. Singly, I do not fear them; but together--Orloff is\r\nthe loaded cannon, and Panin the lighted match, and if I am not wary--\"\r\n\r\nHere, as though he had felt the shock of the ball, Potemkin sprang from\r\nhis seat, and swung his hands above his head. But presently he sank back\r\ninto his chair, and continued his meditations. \"I must spike Orloff\r\nbefore he destroys me. But to spike a cannon, one must be able to reach\r\nit; and Orloff is far away on his estates, like a spider in her wicked\r\nweb. Oh, if I could but reach it, I would soon tear it to pieces! But\r\nwhere are its threads? How shall I find them?--Panin, too, is getting\r\nintimate with the grand duke, and so, is currying favor with the\r\nempress. Yesterday when I entered the parlor without saluting him, Paul\r\ncalled after me with an oath, and turned to his mother with a complaint\r\nof my insolence. And the empress did not utter one word of reproof,\r\nalthough she saw me near enough to hear. That is significant--it means\r\nthat Catharine fears me no longer. But, by the eternal God! she shall\r\nlearn that she has a master, and that her master is Potemkin!\r\n\r\n\"How dare she take Panin into her confidence? He it is who inclines her\r\nto the King of Prussia. This fancy for Prussia is the only thing she has\r\nin common with the grand duke. Love of Frederick is the bridge which\r\nPanin has built to unite them. I must try to lead her into another road\r\nof policy, and so remove Orloff and Panin. Orloff hates Austria, and\r\nif--pshaw! Why is that Joseph so niggardly that one cannot feel the\r\nslightest interest in him? If after refusing all other invitations he\r\nhad paid me the compliment of accepting mine--but, no!--this haughty\r\nAustrian treats me with as little consideration as be does the rest of\r\nthe world; and forces me, in spite of myself, to the side of Frederick.\r\nBut there I find Orloff and Panin, and we cannot work together. They\r\nmust be disgraced, and Catharine made to follow me. How shall I\r\ncommence? What shall I do?\"\r\n\r\nA knock at the door put an end to his communings.\r\n\r\n\"His excellency the Count von Gortz, ambassador of his majesty the King\r\nof Prussia,\" said the officer, who announced the visitors of Potemkin.\r\n\r\n\"Show his excellency into the little parlor,\" said the latter,\r\ncarelessly, \"and tell him that I will receive him there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!--Count von Gortz,\" thought Potemkin. \"That signifies that my\r\nenemies have not yet triumphed, and that the King of Prussia thinks me\r\npowerful enough to conciliate. Well--I must have time for reflection.\"\r\n\r\nAnd without the slightest regard to the station of his visitor, Potemkin\r\nsat for half an hour, revolving in his mind what sort of reception he\r\nshould give to Frederick's overtures. In spite of the slight, Count von\r\nGortz came forward with a gracious smile, as Potemkin, slightly nodding,\r\npassed on to a seat, and waved his hand for the count to take another.\r\n\r\n\"I am commissioned by my sovereign, the King of Prussia, to request an\r\ninterview of your highness,\" began Von Gortz.\r\n\r\nPotemkin nodded, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"His majesty has intrusted me with a most flattering commission,\"\r\ncontinued the ambassador.\r\n\r\n\"Let us hear it,\" replied Potemkin, with indifference.\r\n\r\nCount von Gortz bowed, rose, and drew from his bosom a rich velvet etui\r\nwhich he handed to the prince.\r\n\r\n\"His majesty, my august sovereign, in acknowledgment of your highness's\r\ngreat and glorious deeds, wishes to convey to you a token of his\r\nadmiration and friendship,\" said Count von Gortz, solemnly. \"He has\r\nbestowed upon your highness the order of the Black Eagle, and I have the\r\nHonor to present it to you with the insignia.\"\r\n\r\nPotemkin took the etui and without opening it laid it on the table\r\nbeside him. \"Ah,\" said he, with a shrug, \"his majesty sends me the Black\r\nEagle. I am much obliged to him, but really I have so many orders that I\r\nhave nowhere left to wear them, and how to dispose of this new one I\r\nscarcely know. See for yourself,\" continued he smiling, and pointing to\r\nhis breast, which indeed was covered with crosses, \"do I not look like a\r\nvender of orders, carrying about his samples?\" [Footnote: All Potemkin's\r\nown words. Dohm's Memoirs. vol. i., p 4l3]\r\n\r\n\"If I may be allowed to use your excellency's words, you carry about\r\nsamples, not only of your treasures, but of your heroism and\r\nstatesmanship. It would be a pity if among them, you should not wear a\r\ndecoration of my august sovereign.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then, to oblige the King of Prussia, I will wear the cross,\r\nand, I beg you return him my thanks. Have you anything more to say,\r\ncount?\"\r\n\r\nCount von Gortz cast a searching glance around the apartment, especially\r\nupon the heavy velvet window-curtains.\r\n\r\n\"Get up and look for yourself, if you suspect the presence of any body,\r\n\"said the prince.\r\n\r\n\"Your highness's word is sufficient. Allow me then to speak openly and\r\nconfidentially.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the name of your sovereign?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your highness. You know that the treaty, which for eight years has\r\nallied Russia and Prussia is about to expire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it?\" said Potemkin, carelessly. \"I was not aware of it, for I take\r\nno interest in minor politics.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your highness has in view the great whole only of the field of\r\ndiplomacy,\" replied the complaisant minister. \"But for Prussia this\r\nalliance is a most important one, and my sovereign has nothing more at\r\nheart than the renewal of his alliance with Russia. He knows how much\r\nhis interests here are threatened by the visit of the Emperor Joseph; and\r\nhe desired me to ask of your highness whether it would be advisable for\r\nhim to send Prince Henry to counteract it.\"\r\n\r\nPotemkin replied to this question by a loud laugh. \"What a set of timid\r\npeople you are!\" said he. \"What formalities about nothing! When the\r\nemperor was about to visit us, the czarina must know whether it was\r\nagreeable to the King of Prussia: now the king wishes to know from me\r\nwhether the visit of Prince Henry is expedient.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. His majesty wishes advice from your highness alone, although there\r\nare others who would gladly be consulted by him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Others? you mean Panin--have you, then, asked counsel of no one,\r\ncount?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of no one. My sovereign wishes to consult with no one excepting your\r\nhighness.\"\r\n\r\nFor the first time Potemkin betrayed his satisfaction by a triumphant\r\nsmile. \"If your king comes to me exclusively--mark me well,\r\nEXCLUSIVELY--for advice, I am willing to serve him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your highness may see that my sovereign addresses himself to you\r\nalone,\" replied the minister, handing him a letter in Frederick's own\r\nhandwriting.\r\n\r\nPotemkin, without any appearance of surprise, took it and broke the\r\nseal. The king began by saying that he had every reason to believe that\r\nthe object of Joseph's visit to Russia was to alienate Russia from her\r\nold ally. Then he went jnto ecstasies over the genius and statesmanship\r\nof Potemkin, and besought him to uphold the interests of Prussia.\r\nFurthermore he promised his interest and influence to the prince, not\r\nonly for the present, but for the future, when it was probable that he\r\n(Frederick) could serve Potemkin substantially. [Footnote: This letter\r\nis historical, and is to be found in Dohm's Memoirs, vol. i., p. 412.]\r\n\r\nA long pause ensued after the reading of this letter. Potemkin threw\r\nhimself back, and in an attitude of thoughtfulness raised his eyes to\r\nthe rich pictured ceiling above him.\r\n\r\n\"I do not entirely understand the king,\" said he, after some time. \"What\r\ndoes he mean by saying that he will try to make that possible which\r\nseems impossible?\"\r\n\r\n\"His majesty has learned that your highness is desirous of being created\r\nDuke of Courland. He will use all his interest with Stanislaus to this\r\neffect, and indemnify the Duke de Biron, who would lose Courland, by\r\naugmenting his possessions in Silesia. The king also means that he is\r\nready to find a bride for the future Duke of Courland among the\r\nprincesses of Germany.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really,\" said Potemkin, laughing, \"the mysterious phrase is\r\nsignificant. But the king lays too much stress upon that little duchy of\r\nCourland; if I wanted it, I could make it mine without troubling his\r\nmajesty in the least. As to the bride, I doubt whether it would be\r\nagreeable to the czarina for me to marry, and this matter I leave to\r\nherself. What does the king mean by a proffer of friendship for the\r\nfuture?\"\r\n\r\nCount Gortz leaned forward and spoke scarcely above his breath. \"His\r\nmajesty means to promise his influence with the grand duke, so that in\r\nthe event of his mother's death, your highness would be secure of your\r\nperson and property.\" [Footnote: Raumer's Contributions, etc., vol. v.,\r\np. 485.]\r\n\r\nThis time the prince was unable to suppress his real feelings; he\r\nstarted, and a deep flush overspread his face.\r\n\r\n\"How?\" said he, in a whisper, \"has the king the power to read my\r\nthoughts--\"\r\n\r\nHe did not conclude his sentence, but sprang from his seat and paced the\r\nroom in hurried excitement. Count von Gortz also had risen and\r\ncontemplated him in anxious silence.\r\n\r\n\"Did the courier from Berlin bring any letters to the czarina?\" asked\r\nPotemkin, as he ceased walking and stood before Von Gortz. \"Yes, your\r\nhighness, and I shall deliver them, as soon as I receive the assurance\r\nof your influence with the empress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, you have it. I will go to her at once. Meanwhile go to Count\r\nPanin, to whose department this affair belongs, and induce him to lay\r\nbefore the czarina a proposition for the renewal of the Prussian\r\nalliance. Then ask an audience of the empress and present your\r\ncredentials. You see that I am in earnest, for I work in conjunction\r\nwith my enemy; but before I make one step, you must write out the king's\r\nlast promise to me, adding that you are empowered to do so by his\r\nmajesty of Prussia and having signed the promise, you must deliver me\r\nthe paper.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I inquire the object of these papers?\"\r\n\r\nPotemkin approached the count, and whispered in his ear. \"It is a matter\r\nof life and death. If the grand duke should come to the throne, from the\r\nunbounded regard which he has for the King of Prussia, I know that this\r\npaper will protect me from his vengeance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your highness shall have it.\"\r\n\r\n\"At once? For you understand that I insist have some guaranty before I\r\nact. Your king's words are not explicit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall draw up the paper, and send it to your highness before I ask an\r\naudience of the czarina.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the King of Prussia may reckon upon me, and I shall serve him\r\nto-day, as I hope that in future he will serve me. Go now and return\r\nwith the paper as soon as it is ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe that Prussia means fairly,\" said Potemkin, when he found\r\nhimself once more alone. \"But that only means that Prussia needs me, and\r\nthat,\" cried he, exultingly, \"means that I am mightier than Panin,\r\nmightier than the grand duke--but am I mightier than Orloff?--Oh, this\r\nOrloff is the spectre that forever threatens my repose! He or I must\r\nfall, for Russia is too small to hold us both. But which one? Not I--by\r\nthe Eternal--not I!\"\r\n\r\nJust then there was a knock at the door, and Potemkin, who was standing\r\nwith his fist clinched and his teeth set, fell back into his seat.\r\n\r\n\"How dare you disturb me?\" cried he, savagely.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your highness, but this is your day for receiving the\r\nforeign ambassadors, and his excellency of Austria craves an audience?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cobenzl? Is he alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your highness.\"\r\n\r\n\"In ten minutes, admit him here.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXXXV.\r\n\r\nTHE AUSTRIAN AMBASSADOR.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later the door was opened, and Count Cobenzl, on the point\r\nof his toes, tipped into the room. Potemkin, on the sofa, was looking\r\nthe picture of indifference; his eyes half-shut and his tall form\r\nstretched out at full length, he seemed just to have awakened from\r\nsleep. But during those ten minutes he had been doing any thing but\r\nsleeping. He had been decorating himself with the cross of the Black\r\nEagle, and had allowed the broad ribbon to which it was attached to\r\ntrail upon the carpet.\r\n\r\n\"It is well, Count Cobenzl,\" said Potemkin, greeting the minister, \"that\r\nyou did not come five minutes later, for you would not have met me at\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, I should then have had but five minutes to wait in your\r\nanteroom,\" replied Cobenzl. \"I detest anterooms, and wish that I had\r\ncome ten minutes later, that I might have been introduced to your\r\npresence at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would not have seen me at all, I tell you; for I am about to have\r\nan audience of the empress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, indeed!\" cried Cobenzl. \"That accounts for all these brilliant\r\ndecorations, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"You certainly did not suppose that I was wearing them in Honor of YOUR\r\nvisit, did you?\" asked Potemkin, with quiet insolence.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, I thought it a mere mise en scene.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Count Cobenzl is still mad on the subject of the drama,\" replied\r\nPotemkin, laughing. \"What new comedy are you about to get up at the\r\nAustrian embassy, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"A very pretty thing, just from Paris, your highness. It is called, 'The\r\nDisgraced Favorite, or the Whims of Fortune.'\"\r\n\r\nPotemkin's eyes flashed fire, but he controlled himself, and said,\r\n\"Where is the scene of the drama laid?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not precisely remember. In Tartary, or Mongolia, or--\"\r\n\r\n\"Or in the moon,\" interrupted Potemkin, laughing. \"But come be seated,\r\nand let us be serious.\" So saying, Potemkin threw himself back again\r\nupon the divan, and pointed to an arm-chair, which Cobenzl quietly\r\naccepted. The chair happened to be close to the spot where the ribbon of\r\nthe Black Eagle was lying. Cobenzl seeing that it was under his feet,\r\npicked it up, and presented it to the prince.\r\n\r\n\"You know not what you do, count. You raise your enemy when you raise\r\nthat ribbon. It has just been sent to me by the King of Prussia. I am\r\nquite in despair at being obliged to wear it, for it takes up so much\r\nroom. The star of the Black Eagle is very large. Do you not think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your highness, and I congratulate you upon its possession, for the\r\nclose King of Prussia does not often give away his diamonds.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would appear that diamonds do not abound in Prussia,\" replied\r\nPotemkin, with a gesture of slight toward the cross on his breast.\r\n\"These brilliants are rather yellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you prefer Austrian diamonds?\" asked Cobenzl, significantly.\r\n\r\n\"I have never seen any,\" answered Potemkin, with a yawn.\r\n\r\n\"Then I am happy to be the first to introduce them to your notice,\" said\r\nCobenzl rising, and taking from his pocket a turkey-morocco case. \"My\r\naugust emperor has commissioned me to present to you this little\r\ncasket.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another order!\" said Potemkin, with affected horror.\r\n\r\n\"No, your highness. Orders are toys for grown-up children. But you are a\r\ngreat man, and a toy for you must have some scientific significance. My\r\nemperor has heard that your highness has a costly collection of minerals\r\nand precious stones. His majesty, therefore, with his own hand has\r\nselected the specimens which I have the honor to present in his name.\"\r\n\r\nPotemkin, whose indifference had all vanished as he listened, opened the\r\ncasket with some eagerness; and an exclamation of rapture fell from his\r\nlips, as he surveyed its costly contents. There were Indian diamonds of\r\nunusual size and brilliancy; Turkish rubies of fiery crimson;\r\nmagnificent sapphires; turquoises of purest tint; large specimens of\r\nlapis-lazuli, all veined with gold; and translucent chrysoprase of\r\nbright metallic green.\r\n\r\n\"This is indeed a princely gift,\" cried the covetous Potemkin, perfectly\r\ndazzled by the magnificence, and intoxicated by the possession of all\r\nthese riches. \"Never have I seen such jewels. They blaze like the stars\r\nof heaven!\"\r\n\r\nCobenzl bowed. \"And this sapphire!\" continued the prince, \"the empress\r\nherself has nothing to compare to it!\"\r\n\r\n\"The czarina looks upon your highness as the brightest jewel in her\r\ncrown--as her incomparable sapphire. But observe this turquoise; it is\r\none of the greenish hue so prized by connoisseurs, and its like is not\r\nto be purchased with money.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly Potemkin, ashamed of his raptures, closed the casket with a\r\nclick and pushed it aside.\r\n\r\n\"You can tell your emperor,\" said he, \"that you were an eyewitness of\r\nthe gratification I have received from this superb addition to my\r\nscientific collections. And now, count, without circumlocution, how can\r\nI serve you, and what does the emperor desire of me? Such gifts as these\r\nindicate a request.\"\r\n\r\n\"Frankly, then, the emperor seeks your highness's friendship, and wishes\r\nyou to further his majesty's plans.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are these plans?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, your highness is too shrewd a statesman not to have guessed them,\r\nand not to understand that we merely shift the scene of the war. We\r\npitch our tents at St. Petersburg with the object of winning Russia to\r\nour side.\"\r\n\r\n\"But here Prussia holds the battle-field; you will have to fight against\r\nsuperior numbers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if Prince Potemkin be our ally,\" replied Dobenzl, courteously.\r\n\"True, Prussia has Orloff, Panin, and the grand duke--\"\r\n\r\n\"And who tells you that Prussia has not Potemkin also?\" cried the\r\nprince, laughing. \"Do you not see that I wear the Black Eagle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but your highness is too wise to be the ally of Prussia. You are\r\ntoo great a statesman to commit such a bevue. Orloff, who has never\r\nforgiven you for succeeding him in Catharine's favor, Orloff asks no\r\ngreater triumph than that of harnessing your highness to the ear of HIS\r\npolitical proclivities.\"\r\n\r\n\"He shall never enjoy that triumph,\" muttered Potemkin.\r\n\r\n\"Not if the emperor can prevent it; and, therefore, his majesty hopes\r\nthat your highness will sustain Austria.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what are Austria's plans?\"\r\n\r\n\"Austria wishes to occupy the place which Prussia now enjoys as the ally\r\nof Russia. Prussia, while wooing the czarina, ogles the grand duke, and\r\nit is her interest to bring them together. I know that the matter was\r\nthoroughly discussed yesterday between Count Panin and the Prussian\r\nambassador.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Prussian ambassador was yesterday in conference with Panin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not only yesterday, but to-day, I met him coming from Panin's with his\r\norder of the Black Eagle, and a letter for your highness from the king.\"\r\n\r\n\"Truly your spies are great detectives,\" cried Potemkin.\r\n\r\n\"They are well paid,\" was the significant reply.\r\n\r\n\"And what, for example, were the proposals of Von Gortz?\"\r\n\r\n\"Von Gortz stated that as Panin, the grand duke; and himself were not a\r\nmatch for the emperor and your highness, you were to be won over by\r\nflattery, orders, and promises.\"\r\n\r\n\"True!\" cried Potemkin. \"Your spies are right. What else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Another powerful friend of Prussia has been recalled from his estates,\r\nand summoned to Petersburg.\"\r\n\r\nPotemkin sprang from the sofa with a howl of rage.\r\n\r\n\"What! Orloff summoned by Von Gortz; he who--\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was enticing your highness with vain promises, had suggested to the\r\nczarina the imperative necessity of recalling Orloff, with the express\r\nintention of holding you in check.\"\r\n\r\n\"What an infernal plot! But it bears the stamp of Panin's treachery upon\r\nits face,\" muttered Potemkin, while with hasty strides he walked up and\r\ndown the room.\r\n\r\nCobenzl watched him with a half smile, and taking up the ribbon of the\r\nBlack Eagle, he passed it through his hands by way of pastime.\r\n\r\nAfter much going to and fro, Potemkin stopped, and his countenance was\r\nexpressive of courage and resolve.\r\n\r\n\"Count Cobenzl, I know what are the plans of Austria, and they shall be\r\nsustained. Your interests are mine, for it is no longer a question of\r\nAustria or Prussia, but of Potemkin or Orloff! You see, therefore, that\r\nI am sincere; but Austria must sustain me, and we must tread our\r\npolitical path together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Austria will go hand and heart with your highness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Austria must sustain me, I say, and our password shall be, `The\r\nConquest of Turkey.' That is the spell by which I rule the czarina. My\r\nenemies often fill her mind with distrust of me, but that great project\r\nshields me from their weapons. Still I am in danger; for here in Russia,\r\nwe look neither to the past nor to the future; the excitement of the\r\nhour reigns absolute. A good subject never knows how to regulate his\r\nconduct. If I were sure of blame for doing evil, or of approbation for\r\ndoing good. I might know what to expect from the czarina. But when a\r\nsovereign is the slave of her passions, all ordinary modes of deducing\r\neffect from cause fall to the ground. [Footnote: Potemkin's own words.\r\nRaumer, vol. v., p. 573.] I live in a whirlpool, from which I can devise\r\nno means of escape; but, by the grave of my mother, this life shall\r\ncease! I shall resume my power over the empress, and I shall trample my\r\nenemies underfoot, were they to take shelter under the throne itself!\"\r\n\r\nWhile Potemkin spoke thus, he clinched his fist, and his herculean arm\r\nwas raised as if to fell his invisible enemies.\r\n\r\n\"Whosoever be the foe, Austria will be at your side,\" said Cobenzl.\r\n\r\n\"I believe you,\" replied Potemkin, with returning calmness, \"for it is\r\nyour interest to be there. I know what you desire. First you supplant\r\nPrussia with Russia, and that entails a coolness with France, Prussia's\r\ndearest friend. Then you also dissolve with France, and we both court\r\nthe alliance of England, so as to isolate France and Prussia from\r\nEuropean politics. The plan is good, and will succeed if you are\r\ndiscreet.\"\r\n\r\n\"How discreet?\"\r\n\r\n\"You must weigh well your behavior toward the czarina. I dare not advise\r\nthe emperor, but let me advise you. You have often occasion to see the\r\nempress. Before you see her consult with me as to the topics of your\r\ndiscourse with her, and so we shall always be enabled to act in concert.\r\nAvoid ail dissimulation; let her perceive that you leave craft to the\r\nlovers of Prussia. Flatter as often as you see fit; flatter Catharine,\r\nhowever, not for what she is, but what she ought to be. [Footnote: Ibid.]\r\nConvince her that Austria is willing to further her ambition,\r\nnot to restrain it, as Prussia has always done. Do this, and in a few\r\nmonths Austria will have changed roles with Prussia, and your enemies\r\nand mine shall be overthrown together.\"\r\n\r\nA knock was heard at the, door, and an officer entered.\r\n\r\n\"How dare you interrupt me?\" cried Potemkin, stamping his foot.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon, your highness. The private secretary of the Emperor of Austria\r\nhas orders from his sovereign to hand a note to Count Cobenzl in your\r\nhighness's presence.\"\r\n\r\n\"A very singular order. But we will gratify the emperor. Admit his\r\nmajesty's messenger.\"\r\n\r\nGunther was introduced, who bowed low to Potemkin, passed on, and\r\ndelivered his note.\r\n\r\n\"From his majesty's hand,\" said he. \"Your excellency is to read it at\r\nonce. It requires no answer.\" Then, bowing deeply, the secretary backed\r\nout of the room, and the discreet portiere fell, preventing the\r\ntransmission of the slightest sound.\r\n\r\n\"Read,\" said Potemkin, \"for doubtless the emperor has good reason for\r\nhis haste.\"\r\n\r\nCount Cobenzl broke the seal; but instead of a note for himself, a\r\nsealed dispatch within, bore the address of the prince. The count\r\npresented it at once, and Potemkin eagerly tore it open. He seemed\r\nelectrified by its contents; so much so that Cobenzl started forward to\r\nhis assistance, exclaiming: \"Gracious Heaven, what has happened? Your\r\nhighness is ill!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said Potemkin, \"but read this, that I may be sure I do not\r\ndream.\"\r\n\r\nCobenzl took the letter and read:\r\n\r\n\"My dear Prince: To win your friendship, I have neither flattery,\r\ndecorations, duchies, princesses, nor promises for the future; convinced\r\nas I am that your highness is able to reach the summit of your desires\r\nwithout help from other mortals. But I have something to impart which\r\nwill prove the sincerity of my intentions toward you. An hour ago, Count\r\nOrloff arrived in St. Petersburg, and he is now in secret conference\r\nwith the czarina. \"Joseph II\"\r\n\r\n\"I was right; it was not my secret apprehensions which conjured those\r\nspectral letters,\" cried Potemkin; \"they are really the writing of the\r\nemperor, and Gregory Orloff is here.\"\r\n\r\nHe sprang forward like a bull rushing to the attack.\r\n\r\n\"Gregory Orloff is with Catharine, and I cannot slay him at her feet.\r\nBut stay,\" exclaimed he, exultingly, and then his words resolved\r\nthemselves back into thought. \"My key--my key--I will force her to hear\r\nme. Count,\" continued he aloud, \"I beg of you to excuse me, for I must\r\ngo at once to the empress. Tell the emperor that if I weather the storm\r\nthat is bursting over my head, I will prove to him my eternal gratitude\r\nfor the service he has rendered me this day. Farewell! Pray for me; or\r\nif you like better, go home and get up a fine drama for the day of my\r\nburial.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing less than Voltaire's 'Death of Julius Caesar' would suit such\r\nan occasion; but God forbid that your highness should come to harm! I\r\nhasten to do your bidding.\"\r\n\r\nPotemkin, trembling with impatience, stood watching Count Cobenzl, as\r\nwith his mincing gait he tripped out of the room, and turned again at\r\nthe door to make his last bow. Scarcely had the portiere fallen when he\r\nsprang across the room, and darted toward his sleeping-chamber. Near his\r\nbed stood an escritoire. He flung it open and taking thence a casket\r\nfilled with gold chains, diamonds, and other jewels, he turned out the\r\ncontents with such violence that they flew over the room in every\r\ndirection. He found what he sought; it was a little secret compartment.\r\nHe pressed the spring and it opened, revealing nothing but a key! But\r\nPotemkin snatched it up, and, unheeding the treasures worth a million,\r\nthat lay scattered about the room, he passed into a little dark\r\nanteroom, thence into a corridor, up and down staircases, forward,\r\nforward, rapidly forward!\r\n\r\nFinally he reached the end of a long, narrow corridor. Nothing here was\r\nto be seen save a blank, white wall, which separated Potemkin's dwelling\r\nfrom the palace of the czarina. But in the corner of this wall was a\r\nscarcely perceptible recess. He pressed it with his finger, when the\r\nwall parted, revealing a door--the door which led to Catharine's own\r\nprivate apartments. Potemkin's key unlocked it, and he darted through\r\nthe opening--on, on, until he reached another door, which also yielded\r\nto his key; and then, breathing freely, he looked around the cabinet of\r\nthe czarina, and exclaimed, \"I am saved!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXXXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE EMPRESS CATHARINE.\r\n\r\nThe magnificent state-apartments of the empress were silent and empty,\r\nfor she had given out that she needed solitude to work, she would hold\r\nno levee to-day. But she was not alone; she was in a cabinet which led\r\nto her bedchamber; and with her was Count Orloff, her former lover and\r\nthe murderer of her husband.\r\n\r\nThe empress lay half buried in the depths of a crimson velvet couch; and\r\nher large blue eyes were fixed with an expression of tenderness upon\r\nOrloff, who sat opposite to her. In spite of her fifty years, Catharine\r\nwas a very handsome woman. Age had respected her fair, imperial brow,\r\nand the fingers of time had relented as they passed over it. Her eyes\r\nwere as bright and beautiful as ever; her lips as red, and their smile\r\nas fascinating, as in the days of her youth; and in her bosom beat the\r\npassionate, craving, restless heart of a maiden of seventeen. This heart\r\nwas as capable of love as of hate, and her graceful person as fitted to\r\ninspire love as it had ever been. Just now Catharine was anxious to\r\nplease. She thought over the golden hours of her youthful passion, and\r\ntried to win a smile from Orloff's stern face. She forgot in him the man\r\nwho had placed a bloody crown upon her head, she saw but the paramour\r\nwho had wreathed her brow with the myrtles and roses of requited love.\r\n\r\nThey had spoken of indifferent things, but Catharine had grown silent,\r\nand the silence was becoming embarrassing to Orloff.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty commanded my presence,\" began he.\r\n\r\nCatharine raised her beautiful white arm from the cushion where it lay,\r\nand motioned him to approach.\r\n\r\n\"Hush, Orloff,\" said she, in a low voice. \"No one hears us, do not call\r\nme majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"My revered sovereign,\" stammered Orloff, \"I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Sovereign! Do I look as if I were your sovereign, Orloff? No, no, I am\r\nhere as the woman who is not ashamed of the love we once cherished for\r\neach other. The world says that I am not pious, and verily I believe\r\nthat Voltaire has corrupted me; but I have one steadfast faith, and I\r\ncling to it as fanatics do to Christianity. My religion is the religion\r\nof memory, Gregory; and you were its first hierophant.\"\r\n\r\nOrloff muttered some unintelligible words; for truth to tell, he did not\r\nquite comprehend the vagaries of his imperial mistress. He was a man of\r\ndeeds, fit for action and strife; but there was neither imagination nor\r\npoetry in his nature. He saw, however, that Catharine smiled and\r\nbeckoned. He hastened forward, and bending the knee, kissed her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Gregory,\" said she, tenderly, \"I sent for you to talk of the prospects\r\nof your son.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty speaks of Basil Bobinsky?\" asked Orloff, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Catharine, \"of your son, or rather, if you prefer it, of\r\nour son.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty acknowledges him, and yet you have thrust his father from\r\nyour heart. You sacrificed me to a man whom I hate--not because he is\r\nmy successful rival, but because he does not deserve the love of my\r\nempress; because he is a heartless spendthrift, and a wretch who is\r\nready to sell his sovereign's honor at any moment, provided the price\r\noffered him be worth the treachery. Oh! it maddens me when I think that\r\nGregory Orloff was displaced for a Potemkin!\"\r\n\r\nCatharine laid her jewelled hand upon Orloff's lips. \"Hush, Orloff, do\r\nnot vituperate. I have called for you to-day to give me peace. I do not\r\nwish the two men who share my heart to stand forever glaring at each\r\nother in implacable hatred. I wish to unite you through the sweet\r\ninfluences of a young couple's love. I beseech you, Gregory, do not\r\nrefuse me the boon I crave. Give your consent for Basil to marry the\r\nCountess Alexandra, Potemkin's niece.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" thundered Orloff, starting to his feet, and retreating like an\r\nanimal at bay. \"Never will I consent for my bastard to marry the wench\r\nof such a contemptible fool as Potemkin!\" [Footnote: Orloff's own words.\r\nRaumer's Contributions, etc., vol. v., p. 412.]\r\n\r\nCatharine rose from her couch with a look of tender reproach. \"You will\r\nnot grant my heart's dearest wish?\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot do it, Catharine.\" cried Orloff, wildly. \"My blood boils at\r\nthe very thought of being connected to Potemkin. No, indeed! No tie\r\nshall ever bind me to him, that hinders my hand, should you one day ask\r\nof me, to sever his head from his body.\"\r\n\r\nCatharine again put her hand before Orloff's mouth. \"Hush, you\r\nfulminating Jove!\" said she. \"Must you be forever forging thunderbolts,\r\nor waging war with Titans? But you know too well that in your godlike\r\nmoods you are irresistible. What a triumph it is to win a boon from such\r\na man! Invest me with this glory Orloff; and I give up my plan for a\r\nmarriage between Basil and Potemkin's niece.\"\r\n\r\n\"Niece,\" echoed Orloff, \"say his mistress!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so,\" exclaimed Catharine. \"So treacherous, I will not believe\r\nPotemkin to be!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, Alexandra is his mistress, and the whole court knows it.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I find it so, Potemkin shall feel the weight of my vengeance, and\r\nnothing shall save him!\" cried Catharine, her eyes darting fire. \"But I\r\ntell you it is not so. He has his faults, but this is not one of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you confess that the great Potemkin has faults, do you!\"\r\n\r\n\"It was precisely because of his faults that I sent for you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Me!\"\r\n\r\n\"You--Gregory Orloff, the truest of the true! You have done me good\r\nservice in your life; to you I am indebted for my crown, and you are its\r\nbrightest jewel. But I have a favor now to ask of you which concerns my\r\nhappiness more than any thing you have ever done for me before, my\r\nGregory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak, my empress, speak, and I will die to serve you;\" replied Orloff,\r\ninspired by Catharine's earnestness.\r\n\r\nShe laid her white hand upon his shoulder, and said in her most enticing\r\ntones: \"Be the friend of Potemkin. Let him learn by your example to be\r\nmore careful of the great trusts which he holds from me; more\r\nconciliating, and more grateful. For, indeed, in return for all the\r\nfavors I bestow upon him, he makes my life one long martyrdom. For God's\r\nsake, Orloff, be friendly with Potemkin, and try to rescue me from the\r\ntempests which daily and hourly burst over my devoted head.\" [Footnote:\r\nCatharine's own words.] She leaned her head upon his bosom, and looked\r\nimploringly into his face.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty,\" said Orloff, warmly, \"you know that I am your slave. If\r\nPotemkin is obnoxious to you, speak the word, and I annihilate him. But\r\nmy reputation will not permit me to consort with a man whom I despise,\r\nand whom I should be forced, nevertheless, to regard as the first\r\nsubject of the empire. Pardon me if I cannot grant your majesty's\r\npetition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go, then, cruel man, and leave me to my fate,\" said Catharine in tears.\r\n\r\n\"Since your majesty desires it, I retire.\" And Orloff bowing, turned to\r\nleave the room, but Catharine threw herself upon the sofa with a sob and\r\nhe returned.\r\n\r\n\"Do you weep for Potemkin?\" said he. \"Spare your tears. He loves no one\r\nbut himself, and his only aim in life is to enervate and weaken YOUR\r\nmind, that he may reign in your stead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Orloff, be merciful!\" said Catharine, clasping her hands.\r\n\r\nBut Orloff continued: \"Potemkin has essentially damaged your fleet; he\r\nhas ruined your army; and what is worse, he has lowered you in the\r\nestimation of your subjects, and of the world. If you are willing to be\r\nrid of so dangerous a man, my life is at your disposal: but if you must\r\ntemporize with him, I do nothing to further measures which are to be\r\ncarried out by flattery and hypocrisy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe you, unhappily I believe you,\" said Catharine, weeping.\r\n\"Potemkin deserves all that you say of him, but I have not the heart to\r\npunish him as he deserves. I cannot bid you destroy the giant whose\r\nshadow darkens my throne. You see, Orloff, that I am a poor, weak woman,\r\nand have not the strength to punish the guilty.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see that your majesty prizes the oppressor of my country far more\r\nthan that country's self; and since it is so, I have nothing more to do\r\nhere. Farewell, Catharine--I must return to Gatzchina.\"\r\n\r\nHe kissed the hand of the empress, and passed into the adjoining\r\napartment. He went slowly through the magnificent state-rooms, through\r\nwhich he had to pass to the corridor, and with weeping eyes Catharine\r\nfollowed his tall form from door to door. She would have leaned for\r\nsupport upon that strong man, but he refused to shelter her, and she\r\nfelt a sense of desolation which seemed to her a presentiment of evil.\r\n\r\n\"Orloff, Orloff!\" cried she, imploringly; and she hastened after him. He\r\nwas passing out into the corridor, when he heard her voice, and saw her\r\ncoming fleet as a dove toward him.\r\n\r\n\"Orloff,\" said she, panting for breath, \"do not leave St. Petersburg\r\nto-day. Remain for three days, and, perhaps, in that time I may gather\r\ncourage to accept your help, and rid myself of this man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will await your majesty's decision,\" replied Orloff; \"and if then my\r\nsword is not required in your service, I shall leave St. Petersburg\r\nforever.\"\r\n\r\nHe bowed, and the heavy portiere fell behind him as he passed from the\r\nczarina's sight. Slowly she returned to her cabinet, murmuring, \"Three\r\ndays he will wait to know if--\"\r\n\r\nBut suddenly she started, appalled at the sight of an apparition that\r\noccupied the divan on which she was about to repose her weary limbs. She\r\nuttered a wild scream of terror, for on this divan sat--Potemkin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXXXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE CZARINA AND HER MASTER.\r\n\r\nWith flashing eyes, folded arms, and pale, stern, face, sat Potemkin,\r\nand his glance seemed about to annihilate the terrified woman, who had\r\nneither strength to call for help nor self-possession to greet her\r\nunwelcome visitor. He rose, however, and came forward. Catharine\r\ntrembled and shuddered as he passed her by, locked the door and put the\r\nkey in his pocket.\r\n\r\nThe empress looked around, and in deadly fear saw that there was no hope\r\nof rescue. She was alone with Potemkin, entirely alone!\r\n\r\nNot a word had yet been spoken, but this fearful silence affrighted her\r\nmore than a tempest of angry words would have done.\r\n\r\nAt last Potemkin stood directly before her, and spoke. \"If Potemkin is\r\nobnoxious to you, speak the word, and I annihilate him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" screamed Catharine, \"he knows all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know all--I heard Orloff offer to be my executioner. Pray, why\r\ndid you not accept the offer at once?\"\r\n\r\nHe had come so near, that Catharine felt his hot breath upon her brow,\r\nlike the blast from a furnace.\r\n\r\n\"I ask you again,\" said he, stamping his foot with fury, \"why do you not\r\nlet the axe of your executioner fall upon my neck? Answer me!\"\r\n\r\nCatharine was speechless with fright, and Potemkin, exasperated at her\r\nsilence, raised his clinched hand, and looked so fierce, that the\r\nczarina fell backward almost upon her knees, murmuring--\"Potemkin,\r\nwould you kill me!\"\r\n\r\n\"And if I did,\" cried he, grinding his teeth, \"would death not be the\r\njust punishment of your treachery? Your treachery to me, who have given\r\nyou my heart, my soul, my life, while you betray and accuse me, not face\r\nto face, as would an honorable woman, but behind my back as becomes a\r\ncoward and a hypocrite! Look at me, and answer my question, I command\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\nAgain he raised his hand, and his deep voice rolled like angry thunder\r\nin her ear. Catharine, against her will, obeyed his voice, and raised\r\nher eyes to his. She saw his lofty brow, like that of an angry demi-god,\r\nhis dark, dangerous, fiery eyes, his glistening teeth, his magnificent\r\nframe, lithe, athletic, and graceful as that of \"The statue that\r\nenchants the world,\" and a sensation of shuddering ecstasy flooded her\r\nwhole being. Forgotten were her fears, her terror, her dream of\r\nvengeance; and, regardless of the hand which was still raised to\r\nthreaten her, she cried out, in tones of mingled love and anguish:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Alexandrowitsch, how preter-human is your beauty! You stand, like\r\nan avenging god, before me; and I--I can only worship and tremble!\"\r\n\r\nWith faltering steps she approached, and folding her arms around his\r\nstalwart form, she laid her head upon his breast, and wept.\r\n\r\n\"See,\" murmured she, \"I am here to receive the stroke. Let me die by\r\nyour hand, Gregory Alexandrowitsch, for since you love me no longer, I\r\nam weary of life!\"\r\n\r\nPotemkin heaved a sigh, and freeing himself from Catharine's arms, fell\r\nback upon the sofa, buried his face in his hands, and sobbed\r\nconvulsively.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you weep, Potemkin?\" said Catharine, hastening to his side.\r\n\r\n\"Why I weep!\" exclaimed he. \"I weep because of my own crime. Despair had\r\nwell-nigh made of me a traitor. Why does not this hand wither, which was\r\nuplifted to touch the anointed of the Lord! Why does not Heaven smite\r\nthe wretch whose misery had tempted him to such irreverence of his\r\nsovereign!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Potemkin flung himself at Catharine's feet, crying out:\r\n\r\n\"Kill me, Catharine, that I may not go mad for remorse of my treason!\"\r\n\r\nCatharine smiled, and tried to raise him up.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said she, tenderly, \"live, and live for me.\"\r\n\r\nBut Potemkin still clung to her feet.\r\n\r\n\"No, let me lie here as the sinner lies before the altar of the Most\r\nHigh! I am a traitor--but despair has made me criminal. As I stood\r\nbehind the tapestry, and heard how my empress accused me, I felt that\r\nthe spectral hand of madness was hovering above my brain. Oh, Catharine,\r\nit is you whom I adore, you who have made of me a lunatic!\"\r\n\r\nAgain he buried his face in Catharine's robes, and wept. She, perfectly\r\ndisarmed, leaned over him, caressing him with her hands, and imploring\r\nhim to be comforted.\r\n\r\n\"Let me lie here and weep,\" continued her Alexandrowitsch, \"not for me,\r\nbut for my Catharine--the star of my life! She, whom my enemies would\r\ndeceive; that deceiving they might ruin her, when her only friend is\r\nlost to her forever!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of whom do you speak?\" asked the czarina, frightened.\r\n\r\n\"I speak of those who hate me, because I will not join them in their\r\ntreachery toward my empress--of those who hold out to me gold and\r\ndiamonds, and who hate me because I will not sell my loyalty for pelf.\r\nOh, I was flattered with orders and honors, promises and presents. But I\r\nwould not listen. What cared I for future security? What mattered it to\r\nme that I was to be the victim of Paul's vengeance? I thought of you\r\nalone; and more to me was the safety of your crown than that of my\r\nworthless life! I was loyal and incorruptible!\"\r\n\r\nCatharine had listened with distended eyes and lips parted in suspense.\r\nWhen Potemkin named her son, her whole bearing changed. From the\r\nlove-stricken woman she leaped at once into the magnificent Czarina.\r\n\r\n\"Potemkin,\" said she, imperiously, \"I command you to rise and answer my\r\nquestions.\"\r\n\r\nPotemkin rose with the promptness of a well-trained slave, and said,\r\nhumbly:\r\n\r\n\"Imperial mistress, speak--and, by the grave of my mother, I will answer\r\ntruthfully.\"\r\n\r\n\"What means your allusion to the Grand Duke Paul? Who are the enemies\r\nthat sought to corrupt you? What are their aims?\"\r\n\r\n\"The grand duke is weary of his subordinate position, and yearns for the\r\ncrown which he thinks it is his right to wear.\"\r\n\r\nCatharine's two hands clutched at her head, as though to defend her\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\n\"He shall not have it!\" she screamed. \"He will not dare to raise his\r\nimpious hands to snatch his mother's rights away!\"\r\n\r\n\"He will find other hands to do it; for you well know, Catharine, that\r\nthe crime from which we recoil ourselves, we transfer to other hands,\r\nwhile we accept its fruits.\"\r\n\r\nCatharine shuddered, and grew pale.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" murmured she to herself, \"yes, I know it--well I know it,\r\nfor it has murdered sleep for me!\"\r\n\r\n\"And the grand duke has accomplices, Catharine. Not one, nor two--but\r\nhalf of your subjects mutter within themselves that the crown you wear\r\nhas been Paul's since his majority. Russia is one grand conspiracy\r\nagainst you, and your enemies have pitched their tents at the foot of\r\nyour throne. They may well hate the only man who stands between you and\r\ndestruction. Their arrows have glanced harmlessly from the adamantine\r\nshield of his loyalty, and there remained but the alternative of\r\ncalumniating him to his empress. Oh, Catharine, my angel; beware of\r\nPaul, who has never forgotten how his father lost his life! Beware of\r\nOrloff, who has never forgiven you for loving me! Both these traitors,\r\nwith Panin to truckle to them, are in league with Von Gortz to force you\r\ninto a league destructive of Russian aggrandizement. Oh, my beloved! sun\r\nof my existence! mount into the heaven of your own greatness, and let\r\nnot the cloud of intrigue obscure your light. And when safe in the\r\nnoonday of your splendor, you think of this day, let one warm ray of\r\nmemory stream upon the grave of the man who died because his empress\r\nceased to love him!\"\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of his peroration, Potemkin knelt down and\r\npassionately kissed the hem of Catharine's robe. Then, springing up, he\r\nclasped his hands, and turned away. But the empress darted after him\r\nlike an enraged lioness, and, catching his arm, gasped:\r\n\r\n\"What! you would leave me, Alexandrowitsch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--I go to Orloff, to receive my death! The empress has willed it,\r\nand she shall find me obedient even unto my latest breath.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Gregory,\" said Catharine, weeping profusely, \"you shall remain to\r\nshield me from my enemies.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, she put her arms around his neck, but he drew them away.\r\n\r\n\"No, Catharine, no! After what I have heard to-day. I do not desire to\r\nlive. Let me die! let me die!\"\r\n\r\n\"Potemkin,\" cried she, struggling to detain him, \"I shall never, never\r\nmistrust you again. And I promise you that Gregory Orloff shall never\r\npass this threshold again.\"\r\n\r\n\"How? Do you promise to sacrifice Orloff to me?\" cried Potemkin,\r\neagerly, cured in a thrice of his desire for death.\r\n\r\n\"I do, Gregory, I do. There shall be but one Gregory to reign over my\r\ncourt and my heart, and he shall be Gregory Potemkin!\"\r\n\r\n\"You swear it, Catharine?\"\r\n\r\n\"My imperial word thereupon. Now will you remain and protect me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I remain, to confound your enemies. It shall not be said that I am\r\nflown in the hour when your noble head is endangered. I shall remain for\r\nyour sake, for the peril is very great, Catharine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gracious Heaven, Gregory, what danger threatens me?\"\r\n\r\n\"You ask me such a question while Paul lives, and has Orloff and Panin\r\nfor his accomplices, and Frederick for his friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, dear Gregory, your anxiety leads you into error. I know that\r\nPaul hates me, but I do not believe that Prussia is his ally; for it is\r\nclearly the interest of Prussia to conciliate me, and he is too wise to\r\nentangle himself in such conspiracies just at the expiration of our\r\ntreaty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you noble, unsuspecting woman!\" cried Potemkin, ardently, \"you know\r\nnothing of the egotism of the world. You believe in the honesty of\r\nFrederick, while he speculates upon the consequences of your death!\"\r\n\r\nThe empress grew pale and her eyes flashed with anger. \"Prove it to me,\"\r\nsaid she, imperiously.\r\n\r\nPotemkin drew from his bosom the letter he had that morning received\r\nfrom Frederick. Catharine read it, and then said, \"Much flattery, and\r\nmany mysterious promises. What do they mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Count von Gortz was so good as to explain. The king offered to make me\r\nDuke of Courland, to give me a German princess in marriage, and to\r\nsecure me the favor of your successor.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not possible!\" exclaimed Catharine, \"those were idle words.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, your majesty, I will prove to you that they are not, as soon as\r\nVon Gortz is announced.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress looked at the clock, which pointed to two.\r\n\r\n\"It is exactly the hour I appointed to receive him.\" said she. \"He must\r\nbe in the anteroom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I your permission to go to him?\"\r\n\r\nThe empress nodded, and Potemkin, drawing the key from his pocket,\r\nunlocked the door and disappeared. Catharine locked after him, and\r\nheaving a bitter sigh, said: \"No more hope of rescue! He rules over me\r\nlike irresistible destiny!\"\r\n\r\nIn a few moments Potemkin returned with the paper. Catharine having\r\nlooked over it, returned it with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"I thank the King of Prussia for this,\" said she, gently, \"for my last\r\nhours will no longer be embittered by anxiety for your safety,\r\nAlexandrowitsch. Preserve this paper with care.\"\r\n\r\nPotemkin took it from her hand and tore it to pieces.\r\n\r\n\"Are you mad?\" cried Catharine, \"that you tear this promise of\r\nprotection from Paul?\"\r\n\r\n\"When Catharine dies, I no longer desire to live, and I hope that Paul\r\nmay release me of life at once--I shall die rejoicing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Gregory,\" exclaimed Catharine, again moved to tears, \"I shall never\r\nforget these words! You have sacrificed much for me, and you shall have\r\nprincely reward; on my word you shall! Let the grand duke be careful to\r\nutter no inconsiderate words, for the steppes of Siberia are as\r\naccessible to the prince as to the peasant; and every traitor, were he\r\nthe heir of the crown itself, is amenable to justice before me! And\r\nPanin, with his eternal pratings of honesty and frankness, let him, too,\r\nbeware, for he wavers on the edge of a precipice!\" \"And Prussia?\" asked\r\nPotemkin, with a significant smile.\r\n\r\nCatharine smiled in return. \"I cannot chide HIM, Potemkin, for he would\r\nhave befriended YOU.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the treaty? Do you intend to renew it with this wise, far-seeing\r\nprince?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say. It depends upon the offers he makes. Stay in this room,\r\nGregory; and I will receive Von Gortz in the next one, where you can\r\nhear what passes between us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXXXVIII.\r\n\r\nA DIPLOMATIC DEFEAT.\r\n\r\nThe empress entered the small audience-chamber adjoining her cabinet,\r\nand ringing a bell, gave orders that Count von Gortz and Count Partin\r\nshould be admitted. Then she glided to an arm-chair, the only one in the\r\nroom, and awaited her visitors, who, conformable to the etiquette of the\r\nRussian court, bowed three times before the all-powerful czarina.\r\nPanin's salutation was that of a serf who is accustomed to kiss the dust\r\nfrom his tyrant's feet; Von Gortz, on the contrary, had the bearing of a\r\nman of the world, accustomed to concede homage and to exact it.\r\n\r\n\"Well, count,\" said the empress, graciously, \"what pleasant news do you\r\nbring from Sans-Souci? Has your accomplished sovereign recovered from\r\nhis indisposition?\"\r\n\r\n\"The king has recovered, and will be overjoyed to learn that your\r\nmajesty takes so much interest in his health.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" exclaimed Catharine, \"the great Frederick knows how much interest\r\nI feel in his life--perhaps as much as he has in my death!\"\r\n\r\nCount von Gortz looked in astonishment at the smiling face of the\r\nempress. \"What! Your majesty says that my sovereign has an interest in\r\nyour majesty's death!\"\r\n\r\n\"Did I say so?\" said Catharine, carelessly. \"It was a slip of the\r\ntongue, my dear count. I should have said TAKES, not HAS; for many\r\npeople fancy they have what they would like to take. I should have said\r\nthen, that the king cannot TAKE more interest in my death than I do in\r\nhis life.\"\r\n\r\n\"The king, your majesty, is much older than you, and war has added to\r\nhis years.\"\r\n\r\n\"If war adds to our years,\" replied Catharine, laughing, \"then I\r\ncertainly must be superannuated.\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust that the time has arrived when their majesties of Russia and\r\nPrussia may sheathe the sword, and enjoy the unspeakable blessings of\r\npermanent peace,\" said Von Gortz, with emphasis.\r\n\r\n\"Are you of the same mind, Panin?\" asked Catharine, quickly.\r\n\r\n\"I know from my sovereign's noble heart that she would gladly bestow\r\npeace upon the world, and I believe that the time has come when that is\r\npossible,\" replied Panin, evasively.\r\n\r\n\"It is true, we have for the moment no pretext for war. The troubles\r\nbetween the Porte and myself were settled at the last peace convention,\r\nand he will take good care not to provoke a renewal of hostilities. We\r\nhave no reason to apprehend any breach of peace in Poland, and our\r\nrelations with the other European powers are equally friendly. England,\r\nHolland, and France seek our good-will; Prussia is our firm ally; and\r\nAustria, by sending her emperor himself, has given the most flattering\r\nproof of her consideration for Russia. It would appear that we enter\r\nupon an epoch of universal concord.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to give stability to this great blessing,\" replied Von Gortz, \"it\r\nis the duty of all sovereigns to fuse their separate interests into one\r\ngreat alliance, whose watchword shall be 'Peace!' In presence of those\r\nwho are bound together by the tie of one common policy, no ambitious\r\nenemy will venture to disturb the great international rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we are already able to present the scarecrow of such an\r\nalliance to covetous princes, for we have a firm ally in Prussia, have\r\nwe not?\" said Catharine, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Our treaty was but for eight years, your majesty,\" interposed Panin,\r\n\"and the eight years have expired.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have they, indeed?\" exclaimed Catharine, surprised. \"Well--certainly\r\nyears do fly, and before we have time to think of death, our graves open\r\nto receive us. I feel that I am growing old, and the King of Prussia\r\nwould be wise if he were to direct his new negotiations toward my\r\nsuccessor, and make him the partner of his magnanimous schemes for\r\nuniversal peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty is pleased to jest,\" said Von Gortz, reverentially. \"But\r\nto show you how heartily my sovereign desires to cement his friendship\r\nwith the mighty Empress of Russia, I am empowered by him to make new\r\nproposals for a renewal of the eight years' treaty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you acquainted with these proposals, Panin?\" asked Catharine.\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty. I only know from Count von Gortz that his proposals\r\nare merely preliminary, and not until they obtain your majesty's\r\napprobation, will the king present them formally.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, count, let us hear your preliminaries,\" said Catharine.\r\n\r\n\"My sovereign desires nothing so much as a permanent alliance with\r\nRussia, which shall give peace to Europe, and deter over-ambitious\r\nprinces from trenching upon the possessions of other crowns. To secure\r\nthis end, my sovereign thinks that nothing would be so favorable as an\r\noffensive and defensive alliance, with a guaranty of permanent\r\nboundary-lines between Russia, Prussia, Poland, and Turkey. Such an\r\nalliance, in the opinion of my sovereign, would give durable peace to\r\nWestern Europe. If the conditions be acceptable to your majesty, my\r\nsovereign will make like propositions to Poland and Turkey, and the\r\ntreaty can be signed at once; for it has been ascertained that France\r\napproves, and as for Austria, the very nature of the alliance and its\r\nstrength will force her to respect the rights of nations, and give up\r\nher pretensions to territorial aggrandizement.\"\r\n\r\nThe czarina had listened to this harangue with growing displeasure. Her\r\nimpatience had not escaped the eyes of Panin, and he saw that the scheme\r\nwould be unsuccessful. He had promised to second the proposals of the\r\nPrussian minister, but the stormy brow of the empress was mightier than\r\nhis promise, and he boldly determined to change his front.\r\n\r\nWhen Count von Gortz ceased, a silence ensued; for the czarina was too\r\nincensed to speak. She looked first at the Prussian ambassador, and then\r\nat her minister of foreign affairs, who was turning over in his mind\r\nwhat he should say.\r\n\r\n\"And these are the proposals of the King of Prussia?\" cried she, when\r\nshe found breath to vent her indignation. \"Instead of a simple renewal\r\nof our mutual obligations, you wish to entangle us into alliances with\r\nTurkey! Count Panin, you are my minister. I therefore leave it to you to\r\nanswer the Prussian ambassador as beseems the dignity and interest of my\r\ncrown.\"\r\n\r\nShe leaned back in her arm-chair, and bent a piercing glance upon the\r\nface of her minister. But he bore the test without change of feature,\r\nand turning with perfect composure to his ex-confederate, he said:\r\n\r\n\"As my sovereign has commanded me to deliver her reply, I must express\r\nmy surprise at the extraordinary preliminaries presented by your\r\nexcellency. His majesty of Prussia proposes an alliance of Russia with\r\nTurkey. The thing is so preposterous that I cannot conceive how so wise\r\na prince as your sovereign could ever have entertained the idea!\"\r\n[Footnote: Panin's own words. \"Dohm's Memoirs,\" vol. i. pp. 400, 401]\r\n\r\n\"Good, Panin!\" said Catharine, nodding her head.\r\n\r\nPanin, encouraged by the applause, went on: \"Peace between Russia and\r\nTurkey can never be any thing but an armistice; an alliance with the\r\nPorte, therefore, is incompatible either with our policy or with the\r\nsentiments of my revered sovereign.\" [Footnote: Panin's own words.\r\n\"Dohm's Memoirs.\" vol. i.. pp. 400, 401]\r\n\r\n\"In this case,\" replied Von Gortz, bowing, \"my sovereign withdraws the\r\nproposal which was merely thrown out as an idea upon which he was\r\ndesirous of hearing the opinion of his august ally, the empress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you know my opinion upon this 'idea.'\" cried Catharine, rising\r\nfrom her seat, and darting fiery glances at the ambassador. \"Count Panin\r\nhas expressed it distinctly, and I desire you to repeat his words to the\r\nKing of Prussia. And that the great Frederick may see that I make no\r\nsecret of my policy, he shall hear it. Know, then, that my last treaty\r\nof peace with Turkey was but a hollow truce, whereby I hoped to gain\r\ntime and strength to carry out the plans which I shall never abandon\r\nwhile I live. The king has guessed them, and therefore he has sent me\r\nthese unworthy proposals. Russia has not reached the limit of her\r\nboundaries; her ambition is co-extensive with the world, and she means\r\nto grow and prosper, nor yet be content when Poland bows her neck to the\r\nyoke, and the crescent has given place to the Greek cross!\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the czarina bowed her bead, and haughtily left the room. When\r\nshe raised the portiere, there sat Potemkin in the fulness of his\r\nsatisfaction, ready to greet her with his most beaming smiles. Catharine\r\nmotioned him to follow, and they returned to the cabinet. Once there,\r\nthe czarina threw herself upon the divan and sighed:\r\n\r\n\"Shut the door, Potemkin, close the portiere, for in good sooth I know\r\nnot whether I am about to laugh or cry. I feel as if I had been hearing\r\na fable in which all my schemes were transformed into card houses, and\r\nwere blown away by the wind! But indeed I must laugh! The good King of\r\nPrussia! Only think, Gregory, an offensive and defensive alliance with\r\nTurkey. Is it not enough to make you laugh until you cry?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot laugh at such a disregard for the sacred rights of man,\"\r\nreplied Potemkin, \"This proposal of Prussia is an outrage to the faith\r\nof the whole Russian nation, and a challenge to you, my noble sovereign,\r\nwhose bold hand is destined to tear down the symbol of the Moslem, and\r\nreplace it with that of the Christian!\"\r\n\r\n\"And believe me, dearest friend, I am ever mindful of that destiny,\"\r\nreplied Catharine.\r\n\r\n\"And the treaty between Russia and Prussia--\"\r\n\r\n\"Will not be renewed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Check to the king, then,\" cried Potemkin, \"and checkmate will soon\r\nfollow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the king is old, and would gladly end his days in a myrtle-grove;\r\nwhile I long to continue my flight, higher and higher, till I reach the\r\nsun. But who will go with me to these dizzy heights of power--\"\r\n\r\n\"His majesty, the Emperor of Austria,\" said the loud voice of a\r\ngentleman in waiting, who knocked at the door of the cabinet.\r\n\r\n\"The emperor!\" exclaimed Catharine. \"You know I granted his request to\r\ncome to me unannounced; but I have given orders to the sentries to send\r\nthe word forward, nevertheless, so that I always know when he is about\r\nto appear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, Catharine,\" said Potemkin. \"The crow must give place to the\r\nimperial falcon. Why am I not an emperor, to offer you my hand, and be\r\nyour only protector?\"\r\n\r\n\"Could I love you more if you were an emperor, Gregory? But, hush! He\r\ncomes, and as soon as his visit is ended, return to me, for I must see\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nPotemkin kissed her hand again and again, and vanished through the\r\ntapestry by a secret door, which led to a small corridor connected with\r\nthe czarina's private apartments. But instead of crossing this corridor,\r\nhe turned into a little boudoir, through which the emperor would have to\r\npass and there awaited his appearance. He came, and seeing Potemkin,\r\nlooked surprised, but bowed with a gracious smile.\r\n\r\nPotemkin laid his finger upon his lip, and pointed to the cabinet.\r\n\"Sire,\" said he in a whisper, \"I have anticipated you. Prussia has\r\nreceived an important check, and the treaty will not be renewed. It\r\nrests with your majesty now, to improve the opportunity and supplant the\r\nKing of Prussia. Be sympathetic and genial with the czarina--ABOVE ALL\r\nTHINGS flatter her ambition, and the game is yours. Depend upon my\r\nhearty co-operation.\"\r\n\r\n\"A thousand thanks,\" whispered Joseph in return. Potemkin made a deep\r\nand respectful salutation, and left the room. As he closed the door\r\nnoiselessly behind him, the emperor crossed the threshold of the\r\nimperial cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXXXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE CZARINA AND THE KAISER.\r\n\r\nWhen Joseph entered, he found the empress reclining with careless grace\r\nupon the divan, perfectly unconscious that he was anywhere within her\r\npalace walls. But when she saw him, she sprang up from the cushion on\r\nwhich she lay, and, with protestations of delighted surprise, gave him\r\nboth her hands. He bent over those soft white hands, and kissed them\r\nfervently.\r\n\r\n\"I come to your majesty because I am anxious and unhappy, and my heart\r\nyearned for your presence. I have bad news from Vienna. My mother is\r\nill, and implores me to return home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bad news, indeed!\" exclaimed Catharine, sadly. \"The noblest and\r\ngreatest woman that ever adorned a throne is suffering, and you threaten\r\nto leave me? But you must not go, now that the barriers which have so\r\nlong divided Austria from Russia have fallen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty may well speak of barriers,\" laughed Joseph, \"for we were\r\nparted by a high Spanish wall, and the King of Prussia walked the\r\nramparts, that we might never get a glimpse at each other. Well! I have\r\nleaped the walls, and I consider it the brightest act of my life that I\r\nshould have journeyed thither to see the greatest sovereign of the age,\r\nthe woman before whom a world is destined to succumb.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not give me such praise, sire.\" replied Catharine, with a sigh; \"the\r\nsoil of Maria Theresa should not bestow such eulogium upon me. It is the\r\nEmpress of Austria who unites the wisdom of a lawgiver and the bravery\r\nof a warrior with the virtues of a pure and sinless woman! Oh, my\r\nfriend, I am not of that privileged band who have preserved themselves\r\nspotless from the sins of the world! I have, bought my imperial destiny\r\nwith the priceless gem of womanly innocence!--Do not interrupt me--we\r\nare alone, and I feel that before no human being can I bow my guilty\r\nhead with such a sense of just humiliation as before the son of the\r\npeerless Empress of Austria!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Empress of Austria is still a woman, reigning through the\r\npromptings of her heart, while Catharine wears her crown with the vigor\r\nof a man. And who ever thought of requiring from an emperor the primeval\r\ninnocence of an Arcadian shepherdess? He who would be great must make\r\nacquaintance with sin; for obscurity is the condition of innocence. Had\r\nyou remained innocent, you had never become Catharine the Great. There\r\nare, unhappily, so many men who resemble women, that we must render\r\nthanks to God for vouchsafing to our age a woman who equals all and\r\nsurpasses many men.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have initiated a new mode of flattery, sire,\" said Catharine,\r\nblushing with gratification; \"but if this is your fashion of praising\r\nwomen, you must be a woman-hater. Is it so?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would worship them if they resembled Catharine; but I have suffered\r\nthrough their failings, and I despise them. You know not how many of my\r\nbold schemes and bright hopes have been brought to naught by women! I am\r\nno longer the Joseph of earlier days--I have been shorn of my strength\r\nby petticoats and cassocks.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you so belie yourself?\" said Catharine. \"It is but a few months\r\nsince we had good proof that the ambition of the Emperor Joseph was far\r\nfrom being quenched forever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! your majesty would remind me of that ridiculous affair with\r\nBavaria. It was my last Quixotism, the dying struggle of a patriotism\r\nwhich would have made of Germany one powerful and prosperous nation! And\r\nit was YOU who opposed me--YOU who, of all the potentates in Europe, are\r\nthe one who should have understood and sustained me! Believe me, when I\r\nsay, that had Catharine befriended me there, she would have won the\r\ntruest knight that ever broke a lance in defence of fair ladye. But, for\r\nthe sake of a dotard, who is forever trembling lest I rob him of some of\r\nhis withered bays, the bold Athene of the age forgot her godlike origin\r\nand mission, and turned away from him whom she should have countenanced\r\nand conciliated. Well! It was the error of a noble heart, unsuspicious\r\nof fair words. And fair words enough had Frederick for the occasion. To\r\nthink of such a man as HE, flaunting the banner of Germany in my\r\nface--he who, not many years ago, was under the ban of the empire as an\r\nambitious upstart! He thought to scare me with the rustling of his dead\r\nlaurel-leaves, and when he found that I laughed at such Chinese warfare,\r\nlo! he ran and hid himself under my mother's petticoats; and the two old\r\ncrowns fell foul of one another, and their palsied old wearers plotted\r\ntogether, until the great war upon which I had staked my fame was\r\njuggled into a shower of carnival confetti! Oh, you laugh at me, and\r\nwell may you laugh! I am a fool to waste so much enthusiasm upon such a\r\nfool's holiday!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I do not laugh at you,\" replied Catharine, laying her arm upon his.\r\n\"I laugh for joy, to see how lustily you hate. A man who hates fiercely,\r\nloves ardently, and my whole heart glows with sympathy for such a being.\r\nSo, then, you hate him soundly, this King of Prussia?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hate him,\" cried Joseph, clinching his hand, \"ay, indeed, I hate him!\r\nHe has instigated Germany to oppose me; he wrested Bavaria from me,\r\nwhich was mine by right of twofold inheritance; and I detest him the\r\nmore that he is so old, so gouty, and so contemptible, that to defeat\r\nhim now would not add one hair's breadth to my reputation as a general.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" said Catharine, thoughtfully, \"Frederick is growing very\r\nold. Nothing remains of the former hero but a dotard, who is incapable\r\nof comprehending the march of events--\"\r\n\r\n\"And, yet, is ambitious to legislate. Oh, Catharine, beware of this old\r\nking, who clings to you to support his own tottering royalty, and to\r\nobstruct your schemes of conquest. But he will not succeed with you as\r\nhe has done by me. You have no mother to thrust you aside, while she\r\nbarters away your rights for a mess of pottage! I see your eagle\r\nglance--it turns toward the south, where roll the stormy waves of the\r\nBlack Sea! I see this fair white hand as it points to mosques of\r\nConstantinople, where the crescent is being lowered and the cross is\r\nbeing planted--\"\r\n\r\nCatharine uttered a cry of ecstasy, and putting her arms around Joseph's\r\nneck, she imprinted a kiss upon his brow.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I thank you, Joseph!\" exclaimed she, enthusiastically. \"You have\r\ncomprehended the ambitious projects which, identified as they are with\r\nmy existence as a sovereign, I never yet have dared to speak above my\r\nbreath!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have guessed and I approve,\" said Joseph, earnestly. \"Fate has\r\nassigned you a mission, and you must fulfil it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my God!\" ejaculated Catharine, \"I have found a friend who has read\r\nmy heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who will aid you, when you call him to your side.\"\r\n\r\n\"I accept the offer, and here is my hand. And so, hand in hand, we shall\r\nconquer the world. God be praised, there is room enough for us both, and\r\nwe will divide it between us. Away with all little thrones and their\r\nlittle potentates! Oh, friend, what joy it must be to dwell among the\r\nheights of Olympus, and feel that all below is ours! I am intoxicated\r\nwith the dream! Two thrones--the throne of the Greek and the throne of\r\nthe Roman emperors; two people so mighty, that they dare not war with\r\none another; while, side by side, their giant swords forever sheathed,\r\nthey shed peace and happiness upon the farthermost ends of the earth!\r\nWill you realize with me this godlike dream?\"\r\n\r\n\"That will I, my august friend, and may God grant us life and\r\nopportunity to march on to victory together!\"\r\n\r\n\"To victory,\" echoed Catharine, \"and to the fulfilment of the will of\r\nPeter the Great! He enjoined it upon his successors to purge Europe of\r\nthe infidel, and to open the Black Sea to Christendom. In Stamboul I\r\nshall erect the throne of my grandson, Constantine, while in Petersburg,\r\nAlexander extends the domains of Russia in Europe and in Asia. You do\r\nnot know all that I have already done for classic Greece. From his\r\nbirth, I have destined Constantine to the Greek throne. His nurses, his\r\nplayfellows, and his very dress are Greek, so that his native tongue is\r\nthat of his future subjects. Even now, two hundred boys are on their way\r\nfrom Greece, who are to be the future guards of the Emperor Constantine!\r\nAs the medal which was struck on the day of his birth prefigured his\r\ndestiny, so shall his surroundings of every kind animate him to its\r\nglorious fulfilment. Look--I have already a chart on which Constantine\r\nis to study the geography that my hand is to verify for him and for his\r\nbrother.\"\r\n\r\nThe empress had risen and approached her escritoire. From a secret\r\ndrawer within another drawer she took a roll of parchment which, after\r\nbeckoning to the emperor, she placed upon the table. They unrolled it,\r\nand both bent over it with beating hearts.\r\n\r\n\"Observe first the marginal illustrations,\" said Catharine. \"Here stands\r\nthe genius of Russia, leaning upon the Russian shield. To the left you\r\nsee arrows, horses' tails, Turkish banners, and other trophies--here at\r\nthe top, you see the Black Sea, where a Russian ship is in the act of\r\nsinking a Turk.\r\n\r\n\"Here in the centre, are the empire of Greece and the Archipelago. Take\r\nnotice of the colors on the map, for they show the boundaries. The\r\nyellow is the boundary-line of the Greek empire. It begins in the\r\nnorthwest by Ragusa, takes in Skopia, Sophia Phillippolis and Adrianople\r\nas far as the Black Sea. It then descends and includes the Ionian\r\nislands, the Archipelago, Mitylene, and Samos. That is the empire of\r\nConstantine, whose capital is to be Constantinople. The red lines show\r\nthe future boundaries of Russia. They pass through Natolia, beginning in\r\nthe north by Pendavaschi, and end with the Gulf of Syria.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor, who had been following Catharine's jewelled hand with\r\nanxious scrutiny, now looked up with a significant smile.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty's map reminds me of an incident among my travels. In the\r\nbeginning of my unhappy regency, I was inspecting the boundaries of my\r\nown empire. In Moravia I ascended a steep mountain whence I had a view\r\nof the surrounding country. 'To whom belongs the pretty village?' said\r\nI. 'To the Jesuits,' was the reply. 'And this tract with the chapels?'\r\n'To the Benedictines.' 'And that abbey?' 'To the Clarissarines.' 'But\r\nwhere then are my possessions?' said I.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your majesty would put the same question to me,\" interrupted the\r\nczarina. \"Look at the colors of the map. We have appropriated the yellow\r\nand the red, but there is another color to be accounted for.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see a boundary of green, which includes Naples and Sicily,\" said\r\nJoseph, looking down upon the map with new interest.\r\n\r\n\"Those are the boundary-lines of new Austria,\" said the empress, with a\r\ntriumphant smile. \"As I hope for the reestablisbment of empire in\r\nGreece, so must your majesty accomplish that of Rome. Since you have no\r\nobjection to give me the Black Sea, I shall make no opposition to the\r\nextension of your empire to the shores of the Mediterranean. Italy, like\r\nGermany, is a prey to petty princes. Rescue the Italians from their\r\nnational insignificance, sire, and throw the aegis of your protection\r\nover the site of the old Roman empire. Do you not bear the title of King\r\nof Rome? Give to that title, meaning and substance. Yours is the south\r\nand west, mine is the east, and together we shall govern the world.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph had listened with breathless attention. At first he grew pale,\r\nthen a flush of triumph suffused his face, and he took the hand of the\r\nczarina and drew it to his heart.\r\n\r\n\"Catharine!\" cried he, deeply moved, \"from my soul I thank you for this\r\ninspiration! Oh, my heart's interpreter, you have read my secret\r\nyearnings to be in deed, as well as in word, 'King of Rome!' Yes--I\r\nwould free Italy from the oppression of the church, and lead her on to\r\ngreatness that shall rival her glorious past! God is my witness, I would\r\nhave done as much for Germany; but Germany has rejected me, and I leave\r\nher to her fate. For the future I remain Emperor of Austria; and my\r\nempire shall be so vast, so prosperous, and so powerful, that Catharine\r\nof Russia shall esteem me an ally worthy of the greatest woman of modern\r\ntimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two faithful allies,\" exclaimed Catharine--\"allies bound by one common\r\npolicy, whose watchword shall be 'Constantinople and Rome!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" returned Joseph, with a laugh, \"though while YOU raise the\r\nstandard of the cross in Constantinople, _I_ shall overturn it in Rome.\r\nAs soon as my shackles fall, I shall set to work!\"\r\n\r\n\"I see that you have faith in my plans,\" cried Catharine, joyfully.\r\n\r\n\"Such faith that I would aid them from my heart, were they even to\r\nrequire the cooperation of Frederick.\" [Footnote: Raumer. Contributions,\r\netc., vol. v., p. 444.]\r\n\r\n\"I shall have no cooperation but yours,\" was the reply. \"Besides, I know\r\nthat you owe a grudge to Turkey.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do; for she has taken Belgrade, and I must retake it. The Danube is\r\nmy birthright, as the Black Sea is yours. I give up Germany, to\r\nconcentrate my forces upon Turkey and Italy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us await the proper time, and when I see it, I shall call upon you\r\nto come with me and crush the intrusive Moslem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look upon me as your general, and upon my army as yours,\" replied\r\nJoseph, kissing the hand which the czarina extended. \"And now,\"\r\ncontinued he, \"I must say farewell, and I fear it is for a long\r\nseparation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" cried Catharine. \"Must I lose you so soon?\"\r\n\r\n\"My mother is sick, and yearns for my presence,\" said Joseph. \"The\r\nemperor parted from her in displeasure; but the son must not slight the\r\ncall of a mother, who perchance is on her death-bed. I start for Vienna\r\nto-day; and before I leave, at the risk of being accused of flattery, I\r\nmust express to your majesty the admiration, respect and love which I\r\nfeel for the noblest woman I have ever known.\" [Footnote: The emperor's\r\nown words. Raumer, vol. v., p. 552.]\r\n\r\nThe empress, overcome, put her arms around Joseph's neck, and folded him\r\nto her heart.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, were you my son!\" whispered she, \"I might thank Heaven for the gift\r\nof a noble child who was soul of my soul! Were you mine, I should not be\r\nthe victim of courtiers' intrigues, but with my proud arm within yours,\r\nI might defy the world.\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke these words, Catharine raised the emperor's hand to her\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nJoseph uttered a cry, and sinking on his knees, kissed the hem of her\r\nrobe. Then rising, as if reluctant to break the solemnity of their\r\nparting by a sound, he turned and left the room.\r\n\r\nCatharine looked after him with tearful eyes. \"O God, he has left me! I\r\nhave found a noble heart, only to grieve that it can never be mine. I am\r\nalone, alone! It is so dreadful to be--\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly she ceased, for a deep, melodious voice began to sing.\r\nCatharine knew that the voice was Potemkin's, and that he was calling\r\nher to the secret apartments which she had fitted up, for her lover.\r\n\r\nThe song awakened bitter memories. Potemkin had written it in former\r\nyears, and she had shed tears of emotion when she heard it--tears which\r\nat that time were as precious to him as were his finest diamonds to-day.\r\n\r\nThe music ceased, and two tears which had gathered in the czarina's eyes\r\nstole down her cheeks. As if drawn by an invisible hand, she crossed the\r\nroom, and, stooping down, pressed a tiny golden button which was\r\nfastened to the floor. A whirr was heard, the floor opened and revealed\r\na winding staircase which led from her cabinet to the room of her\r\nfavorite.\r\n\r\nAs her foot touched the first step, she raised her eyes with a look of\r\ndespair to heaven, and her trembling lips murmured these words,\r\n\"Catharine once more in chains!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF JOSEPH.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXL.\r\n\r\nTHE OATH.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa was no more. On the 29th day of November, of the year\r\n1780, she went to rejoin her much-loved \"Franz\"--him to whom her last\r\nwords on earth were addressed. In her dying moments, her pale\r\ncountenance illuminated by joy, the empress would have arisen from the\r\narm-chair in which she sat awaiting her release. The emperor, who had\r\ndevoted himself to her with all the tenderness of which hid nature was\r\ncapable, held her bank.\r\n\r\n\"Whither would your majesty go?\" asked he, terified.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa opened her arms, exclaiming, \"To thee, to thee, I come!\"\r\nHer head fell back, and her dying lips were parted ones more. Her son\r\nbent his head to catch the fluttering words, \"Franz, my Franz--\"\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa was no more! The tolling of bells, and the roll of the\r\nmuffled drum, announced to Vienna that the body of their beloved empress\r\nwas being laid in the vault of the Capuchins, and that after so many\r\nyears of parting, she rested once more by the side of the emperor.\r\n\r\nThe iron doors of the crypts were closed, and the thousands and tens of\r\nthousands who had followed the empress to her grave, had returned to\r\ntheir saddened homes. The emperor, too, followed by his confidants Lacy\r\nand Rosenberg, had retired to his cabinet. His face was inexpressibly\r\nsad, and he paced his room with folded arms, utterly forgetful of his\r\nfriends, whom nevertheless he had requested to follow him, and who, both\r\nin the embrasure of a window, were silently awaiting the awakening of\r\nthe emperor from his dumb grief.\r\n\r\nAt last he remembered their presence. Directing his steps toward the\r\nwindow he stood before them, and looked anxiously first at one, then at\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n\"Was I an undutiful son?\" asked he, in a faltering voice. \"I implore\r\nyou, my friends, make me no courtier's reply, but speak the plain,\r\nunvarnished truth, and tell me whether I was an ungrateful son to my\r\nnoble mother. Lacy, by the memory of your own mother, be honest.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the memory of my mother, sire,\" said Lacy, solemnly, \"no! You bore\r\nthe burden of your filial duty with exemplary patience, and bowed your\r\nwill to the will of your mother, even when you knew that she erred in\r\njudgment.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, Rosenberg?\" asked Joseph, with a sad smile.\r\n\r\n\"My opinion, sire, is that you were a noble, all-enduring son, whose\r\nheart was not hardened against his mother, although from your childhood\r\nit had provocation to become so. Your majesty bore with more than any\r\nother man would have done whose lips had not been locked by filial\r\ntenderness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was silent but resentful,\" said Joseph, mournfully. \"I bore my\r\nburdens ungraciously, and Maria Theresa was aware of it. I have often\r\nbeen angered by her, but she has often wept for my sake. Oh, those tears\r\ndisturb my conscience.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty should remember that the empress forgave and forgot all\r\nthe dissensions of by-gone years, and that in her last illness she\r\nexpressed herself supremely happy in your majesty's care and\r\ntenderness.\"\r\n\r\n\"You should remember also, that with the sagacity which is often\r\nvouchsafed to the dying, Maria Theresa confessed that she had\r\nunwillingly darkened your majesty's life by her exactions, and in the\r\nmagnanimity of her regret asked your forgiveness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have said all this to myself,\" replied Joseph, \"I have repeated it\r\nover and over in these wretched sleepless nights; but still the dagger\r\nof remorse is in my heart, and now I would gladly give years of my life,\r\nif my mother were living, that I might redeem the past by cheerful\r\nsubmission to her every wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let the great empress rest in peace!\" exclaimed Lacy. \"She was weary of\r\nlife, and died with more than willingness. Your majesty must cherish\r\nYOUR life, mindful of the vast inheritance which your mother has left\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Lacy,\" cried Joseph, warmly. \"It is a noble inheritance,\r\nand I swear to you both to cherish it, not for my own sake, but for the\r\nsake of the millions of human beings of whose destinies I shall be the\r\narbiter. I swear to be a good sovereign to my people. By the tears which\r\nmy mother has shed for me, I will dry the tears of the unfortunate, and\r\nthe blessing she left me with her dying breath, I shall bestow upon the\r\nAustrians whom she loved so well. If I should ever forget this vow, you\r\nare here to remind me of it. And now that my reign begins, I exact of\r\nyou both a proof of your loyalty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak, sire,\" said Lacy, with a bright and affectionate smile.\r\n\r\n\"Put me to the test,\" cried Rosenberg, \"and I shall not flinch.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor laid his hands upon the shoulders of his friends, and looked\r\nat them with unmistakable affection. \"Happy is the man who possesses two\r\nsuch friends. But hear what I exact of you. I stand upon the threshold\r\nof a new order of things. I am at last an emperor, free to carry out the\r\ndesigns which for so many long years I have been forced to stifle in my\r\nsorrowing heart. I am resolved to enlighten and to elevate my subjects.\r\nBut if in my zeal to do well. I should lack discretion, it is for you to\r\ncheck and warn me. And if I heed not your warnings, you shall persist,\r\neven if your persistence becomes offensive. Will you promise me to do\r\nso, dear friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"We promise,\" said both with one breath.\r\n\r\n\"God and the emperor have heard the promise. Give me your honest hands,\r\nmy best and truest friends. You, at least, I shall never doubt; I feel\r\nthat your friendship will be mine until the day of my death!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty is the youngest of us three,\" said Lacy, \"and you speak as\r\nif we would outlive you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Age is not reckoned by years,\" replied the emperor, wearily, \"but by\r\nwounds; and if I count the sears that disappointment has left upon my\r\nheart, you will find that I have lived longer than either of you.\r\nPromise, then, to be with me to the last, and to close my eyes for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your wife and children will do that for you, sire,\" said Rosenberg.\r\n\r\n\"I will never marry again. My nephew Francis shall be my heir, and I\r\nshall consider him as my son. The Empress of Russia has consented to\r\ngive him her adopted daughter in marriage, and I trust that Francis may\r\nbe happier in wedlock than his unfortunate uncle. My heart is no longer\r\nsusceptible of love.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet it beats with such yearning love toward mankind!\" exclaimed\r\nRosenberg.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--my heart belongs to my people, and there is nothing left of it for\r\nwoman. For my subjects alone I shall live. Their souls shall be free\r\nfrom the shackles of the church, and they shall no longer be led like\r\nchildren by the hands of priests or prelates! You have tranquillized my\r\nconscience, and I have received your vow of fidelity till death. With\r\ntwo such mentors to advise me, I may hope, at last, to do something for\r\nfame!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXLI.\r\n\r\nPRINCE KAUNITZ.\r\n\r\nFor three days Prince Kaunitz had not left his cabinet. No one was\r\nallowed to approach him, except the servant who brought the meals, which\r\nthe prince sent away almost untouched. His household were sorely\r\ntroubled at this, for no one had as yet ventured to communicate the\r\ntidings of the empress's death. Still he seemed to know it, for\r\nprecisely on the day of her demise, Kaunitz had retired to his cabinet,\r\nwhence he had not emerged since.\r\n\r\nTo-day the tolling of bells and the dull sound of muffed drums had\r\ndoubtless revealed to him that the funeral was at hand. Still he had\r\nquestioned nobody, and sat in stupid silence, apparently unmindful of\r\nthe tumult without. Even when the procession passed his own house, he\r\nremained rigidly in his chair, his large eyes glaring vacantly at the\r\nwall opposite.\r\n\r\nBaron Binder, who had noiselessly entered the room, and had been\r\nwatching the prince, saw two large tears rolling slowly down his face,\r\nand the sight of these tears emboldened him to approach the solitary\r\nmourner.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw Binder, his lips quivered slightly, but he made no other\r\nsign. Binder laid his hand upon the shoulder of the prince, and felt a\r\nstart.\r\n\r\n\"Take compassion upon us who love you,\" said he, in a low, trembling\r\nvoice. \"Tell us what it is that grieves you, dear friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" replied Kaunitz.\r\n\r\n\"This is the first time that I have ever known your highness to speak an\r\nuntruth,\" cried Binder, boldly. \"Something grieves you; if not--why\r\nthose blanched cheeks, those haggard eyes, and the tears that even now\r\nare falling upon your hands?\"\r\n\r\nPrince Kaunitz moved uneasily, and slowly turned his head.\r\n\r\n\"Who gave you the right to criticise my behavior?\" asked he, in a\r\nfreezing tone of displeasure. \"Does it become such as you to measure or\r\ncomprehend the sufferings of a great mind? If it pleases you to parade\r\nyour troubles go out and ask sympathy of the contemptible world, but\r\nleave to me the freedom of sorrowing alone: My grief is self-sustaining.\r\nIt needs no prop and no consolation. Attend to your affairs of state,\r\nand go hence. I wish no spies upon my actions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Binder, tenderly, \"'tis not my eyes that have acted the\r\nspies, but my heart, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Baron Binder,\" interrupted Kaunitz, \"you are not under this roof to\r\ndissect my sentiments, or to confide to me your own; you are here to\r\nassist me as a statesman. Go, therefore, and confine your efforts to the\r\nbusiness of your office.\"\r\n\r\nBinder heaved a sigh, and obeyed. It was useless to offer sympathy when\r\nit provoked such stinging resentment.\r\n\r\nThe state referendarius had scarcely reached his study, before the\r\nfolding-doors of Prince Kaunitz's entrance-rooms were flung wide open,\r\nand the valet in attendance announced--\r\n\r\n\"His majesty the emperor.\"\r\n\r\nA shudder was perceptible through the frame of the prince, and he\r\nclutched at the arms of the chair in an attempt to rise.\r\n\r\n\"Do not rise,\" said Joseph, coming forward; \"I have intruded myself upon\r\nyou without ceremony, and you must receive me in like manner.\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz sank back, and inclined his head. He had not the power to make a\r\nreply. Joseph then motioned to the valet to withdraw, and drew a chair\r\nto the prince's side.\r\n\r\nThere was a short silence and the emperor began: \"I bring you greetings\r\nfrom my mother.\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz turned and gazed at the emperor with a look of indescribable\r\nanguish. \"Her last greeting,\" said he, almost inaudibly.\r\n\r\n\"You know it, then? Who has been bold enough to break this sad\r\nintelligence to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one, your majesty. For three days I have received no bulletins. When\r\nthey ceased, I knew that--Maria Theresa was no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since you know it, then, my friend, I am relieved from a painful task.\r\nYes, I bring you the last greetings of a sovereign who loved you well. \"\r\n\r\nA sigh, which was rather a sob, indicative of the inner throes that were\r\nracking the statesman's whole being, burst from his heart. His head fell\r\nupon his breast, and his whole body trembled. Joseph comprehended the\r\nimmensity of his grief, and made no ineffectual attempt to quell it.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said he, \"that you grieve, not only for her children, but for\r\nAustria.\"\r\n\r\n\"I grieve for you--I grieve for Austria--and, oh! I grieve for myself,\"\r\nmurmured Kaunitz.\r\n\r\n\"You have been a faithful friend to my mother,\" continued Joseph, \"and\r\nthe empress remembered it to her latest hour. She bade me remind you of\r\nthe day on which you dedicated your life to Austria's welfare. She told\r\nme to say to you that the departure of your empress had not released\r\nyou. It had increased your responsibilities, and she expected of you to\r\nbe to her son what you have ever been to her, a wise counsellor and a\r\ncherished friend. Do you accept the charge and transfer the rich boon of\r\nyour services to me?\"\r\n\r\nThe prince opened his lips, but not a sound came forth. For the second\r\ntime an expression of agony fluttered over his face, and no longer able\r\nto control his feelings, he burst into tears. The sight so moved the\r\nemperor, that he, too, shed tears abundantly.\r\n\r\nKaunitz gradually recovered himself. With an impatient movement he\r\ndashed away the last tears that had gathered in his eyes, and dried his\r\nmoist cheeks with his delicate cambric handkerchief. He was himself\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your majesty,\" said he, respectfully inclining his head.\r\n\"You see how grief has mastered me. I have behaved like a child who is\r\nlearning his first difficult lesson of self-control. Forgive this\r\nmomentary weakness, and I promise that you shall never see me so\r\noverwhelmed as long as I live.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor, with an affectionate smile, pressed the old statesman's\r\nhand. \"I have nothing to forgive, dear prince. I have to thank you for\r\npermitting me to view the penetralia of a great man's heart. And still\r\nmore have I to thank you for the sincerity with which you have loved\r\nMaria Theresa. I accept it as a pledge of your obedience to her last\r\nwishes. May I not?\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz looked up, and answered with firmness, \"Sire, this is the hour\r\nof unreserve, and I will speak the unvarnished truth. I have been\r\nexpecting the last greeting of my empress, and had I not received her\r\ncommand to serve your majesty, I should have known that Austria had need\r\nof me no more, and ere long I would have followed my peerless mistress\r\nto the grave.\"\r\n\r\n\"How! you would have laid violent hands upon your life?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, sire--I would simply have starved to death; for I never could\r\nhave tasted food again, had I once obtained the conviction that I had\r\nbecome superannuated and useless. Your majesty has saved my life, for I\r\nhave eaten nothing since she--went; and, now, since I must still live\r\nfor Austria, let me implore you to forget what you have seen of me\r\nto-day. If I have ever served Austria, it has been in virtue of the mask\r\nwhich I have always worn over my heart and features. Let me resume it\r\nthen, to wear it for life. Had we worn our political mask a little\r\nlonger, Frederick would not have foiled us in our Bavarian projects. We\r\nmust beware of him, old though he be, for he is a shrewd, far-seeing\r\ndiplomatist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I do not fear his prying propensities!\" cried Joseph. \"Let him\r\nwatch our proceedings--and much good may it do him. He will see a new\r\norder of things in Austria. Will you stand by me, prince, and lend me a\r\nhelping hand until my stately edifice is complete?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your edifice, above all things, will need to be upon a secure\r\nfoundation. It must be fast as a mountain, behind which we can intrench\r\nourselves against the stormings of the clergy and the nobility.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor gave a start of joyful surprise. \"You have guessed my\r\nprojects of reform, and I have not yet uttered a word!\"\r\n\r\n\"I had guessed them long ago, sire, I had read them more than once upon\r\nyour countenance when priests and nobles were by; and I triumphed in\r\nsecret, as I thought of the day that was to come, when you would be the\r\nsole arbiter of their destinies.\"\r\n\r\n\"The day has come! it has come!\" exclaimed Joseph, exultingly. \"Now\r\nshall begin the struggle in church and convent, in palace and castle;\r\nand we shall shake off ambitious prelates and princes as the lion does\r\nthe insect that settles upon his mane!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let the lion beware, for the insect bears a sting, and the sting bears\r\npoison!\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall rob it of its sting before we rob it of its treasures. And\r\nwhence comes the sting of these troublesome gnats? It resides in the\r\nriches of the church and the privileges of the nobles. But the noble\r\nshall bow his haughty head to my laws, and the church shall yield up her\r\nwealth. The lord of the soil shall come down to the level of his serf,\r\nand by the eternal heavens above me, the priest shall he made as\r\nhomeless as Christ and His apostles!\"\r\n\r\n\"If your majesty can compass this, your people will adore you as a\r\nsecond Messiah.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do it! I will free my people from bondage, and if I am made to\r\ndie the death of the cross, I shall exult in my martyrdom,\" exclaimed\r\nJoseph, with flashing eyes. \"The internal administration of Austria\r\ncalls for reform. The empire over which I am to reign must be governed\r\naccording to my principles. Religious prejudices, fanaticism, and party\r\nspirit must disappear, and the influence of the clergy, so cherished by\r\nmy mother, shall cease now and forever. Monks and nuns shall quit their\r\nidle praying, and work like other men and women; and I shall turn the\r\nwhole fraternity of contemplatives into a body of industrious burghers.\"\r\n[Footnote: This whole conversation is historical. The expressions are\r\nthose of the emperor. See \"Letters of Joseph II.,\" p. 98.]\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sire,\" exclaimed Kaunitz, \"your words affright me. Bethink you that\r\nyou throw the brand of revolt among a numerous and influential class.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will strip them of their armor, and so they shall become innoxious,\"\r\n\r\n\"Gracious Heaven!\" ejaculated Kaunitz, \"your majesty, will--\"\r\n\r\n\"Capture the convents, and carry off the booty.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that will be tantamount to a declaration of war against Rome!\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly what I propose to bring about. I desire to teach this servant\r\nof God that I am absolute monarch of my own dominions, and that his--\"\r\n\r\n\"True, sire, true, but be cautious, and go warily to work.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no time to temporize,\" cried Joseph. \"What is to be done shall\r\nbe done at once. So much the more quickly that this question of\r\nstripping the convents is not only one of principle but of expediency\r\nalso. They abound in objects of value, and my treasury needs\r\nreplenishing. The state debt is large, and we must retrench. I shall\r\nnot, like my gracious mother, require a budget of six millions. I intend\r\nto restrict myself to the expenditure which suffices for the King of\r\nPrussia. Of course. I shall not, like the munificent Maria Theresa,\r\ndispense ducats and smiles in equal profusion. My people must be\r\nsatisfied with a greeting that is not set to the music of the chink of\r\ngold. Neither shall I, like my imperial lady-mother, keep two thousand\r\nhorses in my stables. Moreover, the pension-list shall be decreased--let\r\nthe retrenchment fall upon whom it may. But all this will not suffice to\r\nstraighten my financial affairs. I need several millions more. And as\r\nthey are to be found in church and convent, I shall seek them there.\"\r\n\r\nPrince Kaunitz had listened to this bold harangue with perfect\r\nastonishment. Several times in the course of it, he had nodded his head,\r\nand more than once he had smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" said he, \"you have such an intrepid spirit that my seared old\r\nheart beats responsive to the call like an aged war-horse that neighs at\r\nthe trumpet's note. Be it so, then. I will fight at your side like a\r\nfaithful champion, happy, if, during the strife, I be permitted to ward\r\noff from my emperor's head a blow from his adversary's hands. Remember\r\nthat we go forth to fight thousands. For the people are with the clergy,\r\nand they will cry out even more bitterly than they did at the expulsion\r\nof the Jesuits.\"\r\n\r\n\"And they will cease to cry, as they did on that occasion,\" exclaimed\r\nthe emperor, with a merry laugh. \"Courage, Kaunitz, courage! and we\r\nshall prevail over Rome and all monkdom; and when we shall have utilized\r\ntheir treasures, the people will return to their senses, and applaud the\r\ndeed.\" [Footnote: Joseph's own words. See Letters, etc., p. 49.]\r\n\r\n\"So be it then, your majesty. I will help you to pluck the poisonous\r\nweeds, and sow in their places good secular grain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXLII.\r\n\r\nTHE BANKER AND HIS DAUGHTER.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful daughter of the Jewish banker was alone in her apartments,\r\nwhich, from the munificence of her wealthy father, were almost regal in\r\ntheir arrangements.\r\n\r\nRachel, however, was so accustomed to magnificence that she had lost all\r\nappreciation of it. She scarcely vouchsafed a glance to her inlaid\r\ncabinets, her oriental carpets, her crystal lustres, and her costly\r\npaintings. Even her own transcendent beauty, reflected in the large\r\nVenetian mirrors that surrounded her, was unheeded, as she reclined in\r\nsimple muslin among the silken cushions of a Turkish divan.\r\n\r\nBut Rachel, in her muslin, was lovely beyond all power of language to\r\ndescribe. Her youth, grace, and beauty were ornaments with which\r\n\"Nature's own cunning hand,\" had decked her from her birth. What diamond\r\never lit up Golconda's mine with such living fire as flashed from her\r\nhazel eyes? What pearl upon its ocean-bed ever glittered with a sheen\r\nlike that of the delicate teeth that peeped from between her pouting\r\ncoral lips? When she wandered in her vapory white dresses through her\r\nfather's princely halls, neither pictures nor statues there could\r\ncompare in color or proportion with the banker's queenly daughter\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nShe lay on the dark silk cushions of the divan like a swan upon the\r\nopalline waters of the lake at sunset. One arm, white and firm as\r\nCarrara marble, supported her graceful head, while in her right hand she\r\nheld an open letter.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my beloved!\" murmured she, \"you hope every thing from the\r\nmagnanimity of the emperor. But in what blessed clime was ever a Jewess\r\npermitted to wed with a Christian? The emperor may remove the shackles\r\nof our national bondage, but he can never lift us to social equality\r\nwith the people of another faith. There is nothing to bridge the gulf\r\nthat yawns between my beloved and me. It would kill my father to know\r\nthat I had renounced Judaism, and I would rather die than be his\r\nmurderer. Oh, my father! oh, my lover! My heart lies between you, and\r\nyet I may not love you both!--But which must I sacrifice to the other?\"\r\n\r\nShe paused and raised her eyes imploringly to heaven. Her cheeks\r\nflushed, her bosom heaved, and no longer able to restrain her agitation,\r\nshe sprang from her divan, and light as a gazelle, crossed the room, and\r\nthrew open the window.\r\n\r\n\"No, my lover,\" said she, \"no, I cannot renounce you! A woman must leave\r\nfather and mother, to follow him who reigns over her heart! I will leave\r\nall things, then, for you, my Gunther!\" And she pressed his letter to\r\nher lips; then folding it, she hid it in her bosom.\r\n\r\nA knock at the door caused her to start slightly, and, before she had\r\ntime to speak, the Jewish banker entered the room.\r\n\r\n\"My dear father!\" exclaimed Rachel, joyfully, flying to him and putting\r\nher arms around his tall, athletic form.\r\n\r\nEskeles Flies stroked her dark hair, and pressed a kiss upon her brow.\r\n\"I have not seen you for two days, father,\" said Rachel, reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\"I have been absent inspecting my new factories at Brunn, my daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you went away without a word of adieu to me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Adieu is a sorrowful word, my daughter, and I speak it reluctantly; but\r\na return home is a joy unspeakable, and you see that my first visit is\r\nto YOU, dear child. To-day I come as a messenger of good tidings.\"\r\n\r\nRachel raised her head, and a flush of expectation rose to her face.\r\n\r\n\"Do the good tidings concern us both?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"Not only ourselves, but our whole people. Look at me, Rachel, and tell\r\nme wherein I have changed since last we met.\"\r\n\r\nRachel stepped back and contemplated her father with an affectionate\r\nsmile. \"I see the same tall figure, the same energetic, manly features,\r\nthe same dear smile, and the same--no, not quite the same dress. You\r\nhave laid aside the yellow badge of inferiority that the Jew wears upon\r\nhis arm.\"\r\n\r\n\"The emperor has freed us from this humiliation, Rachel. This burden of\r\na thousand years has Joseph lifted from our hearts, and under his reign\r\nwe are to enjoy the rights of men and Austrians!\"\r\n\r\n\"The emperor is a great and magnanimous prince!\" exclaimed Rachel.\r\n\r\n\"We have been trampled so long under foot,\" said the banker, scornfully,\r\n\"that the smallest concession seems magnanimity. But of what avail will\r\nbe the absence of the badge of shame? It will not change the peculiarity\r\nof feature which marks us among men, and betrays us to the Christian's\r\nhate.\"\r\n\r\n\"May our nation's type be ever written upon our faces!\" exclaimed\r\nRachel. \"The emperor will protect us from the little persecutions of\r\nsociety.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will have little time to think of us, he will have enough to do to\r\nprotect himself from his own enemies. He has decreed the dispersion of\r\nthe conventual orders, and as he has refused to yield up the goods of\r\nthe church, his subjects are becoming alienated from a man who has no\r\nregard for the feelings of the pope. Moreover, he has proclaimed\r\nuniversal toleration.\"\r\n\r\n\"And has he included us among the enfranchised, dear father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my child, even we are to be tolerated. We are also to be permitted\r\nto rent estates, and to learn trades. Mark me--not to BUY estates, but\r\nto rent them: We are not yet permitted to be landed proprietors.\r\n[Footnote: Ramshorn, \"Joseph II,\" p. 259.] But they cannot prevent the\r\nJew from accumulating gold--'yellow, shining gold;' and riches are our\r\nrevenge upon Christendom for the many humiliations we have endured at\r\nits pious hands. They have withheld from us titles, orders, and rank,\r\nbut they cannot withhold money. The finger of the Jew is a magnet, and\r\nwhen he points it, the Christian ducats fly into his hand. Oh, Rachel! I\r\nlook forward to the day when the Jews shall monopolize the wealth of the\r\nworld: when they shall be called to the councils of kings and emperors,\r\nand furnish to their oppressors the means of reddening the earth with\r\none another's blood! We shall pay them to slaughter one another, Rachel;\r\nand that shall be our glorious revenge!\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear, dear father,\" interposed Rachel, \"what has come over you that\r\nyou should speak such resentful words? Revenge is unworthy of the noble\r\nsons of Israel; leave it to the Christian, whose words are love, while\r\nhis deeds are hate.\"\r\n\r\n\"His words to the Jew are as insolent as his deeds are wicked. But I\r\nknow very well how to exasperate and humble the Christians. I do it by\r\nmeans of my rich dwelling and my costly equipages. I do it by inviting\r\nthem to come and see how far more sumptuously I live than they. The\r\nsight of my luxuries blackens their hearts with envy; but most of all\r\nthey envy the Jewish banker that his daughter so far outshines in beauty\r\ntheir Gentile women!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear father,\" said Rachel, coloring, \"you go to extremes in praise, as\r\nin blame. You exaggerate the defects of the Christian, and the\r\nattractions of your daughter.\"\r\n\r\nHer father drew her graceful head to him, and nestled it upon his\r\nbreast. \"No, my child, no, I do not exaggerate your beauty. It is not I\r\nalone, but all Vienna, that is in raptures with your incomparable\r\nloveliness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, dear father! Would you see me vain and heartless?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would see you appreciate your beauty, and make use of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make use of it! How?\"\r\n\r\n\"To help your father in his projects of vengeance. You cannot conceive\r\nhow exultant I am when I see you surrounded by hosts of Christian\r\nnobles, all doing homage to your beauty and your father's millions.\r\nEncourage them, Rachel, that they may become intoxicated with love, and\r\nthat on the day when they ask me for my daughter's hand, I may tell them\r\nthat my daughter is a Jewess, and can never be the wife of a Christian!\"\r\n\r\nRachel made no reply; her head still rested on her father's bosom, and\r\nhe could not see that tears were falling in showers from her eyes. But\r\nhe felt her sobs, and guessing that something was grieving her, he drew\r\nher gently to a seat.\r\n\r\n\"Dear, dear child,\" cried he, anxiously, \"tell me why you weep.\"\r\n\r\n\"I weep because I see that my father loves revenge far more than his\r\nonly child; and that he is willing to peril her soul by defiling it with\r\nwicked coquetry. Now I understand why it is that such a profligate as\r\nCount Podstadsky has been suffered to pollute our home by his visits!\"\r\n\r\nThe banker's face grew bright. \"Then, Rachel, you do not love him?\" said\r\nhe, pressing his daughter to his heart.\r\n\r\n\"Love him!\" exclaimed Rachel, with a shudder, \"love a man who has\r\nneither mind nor heart!\"\r\n\r\n\"And I was so silly as to fear that your heart had strayed from its\r\nduty, my child, and that the tears which you are shedding were for him!\r\nBut I breathe again; and can exult once more in the knowledge of his\r\nlove for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, father,\" said Rachel, \"he does not love me. He loves nothing except\r\nhimself; but he wearies me with his importunities.\"\r\n\r\n\"What has he done to you, my daughter?\"\r\n\r\n\"During your absence he came three times to see me. As I denied myself,\r\nhe had resort to writing, and sent me a note requesting a private\r\ninterview. Read it for yourself, father. It lies on the table.\"\r\n\r\nThe banker read, and his eyes flashed with anger. \"Unmannerly wretch!\"\r\nexclaimed he, \"to use such language to my daughter! But all Vienna shall\r\nknow how we scorn him! Answer his note favorably, Rachel; but let the\r\nhour of your interview be at mid-day, for I wish no one to suppose that\r\nmy daughter receives Christians by stealth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will obey you, father,\" replied Rachel, with a sigh; \"but I would be\r\nbetter satisfied to thrust him, without further ceremony, from the door.\r\nI cannot write to him, however, that would be a compromise of my own\r\nhonor; but I will send him a verbal message by my own faithful old\r\nnurse. She knows me too well to suspect me of clandestine intercourse\r\nwith a wretch like Podstadsky.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not send the girl who delivered his letter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I discharged her on the spot for her indiscretion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravely done, my precious child! You are as wise and as chaste as\r\nIsrael's beauteous daughters have ever been. I shall reward you for\r\ndespising the Christian count. But I must go. I must go to double my\r\nmillions and lay them all at my Rachel's feet.\"\r\n\r\nHe kissed his daughter's forehead, and rose from the divan. But as he\r\nreached the door he turned carelessly.\r\n\r\n\"Has the emperor's private secretary visited you of late?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was here yesterday,\" said Rachel, blushing.\r\n\r\n\"Did you receive him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear father, for you yourself presented him to me.\"\r\n\r\nEskeles Flies was silent for a while. \"And yet,\" resumed he, \"I believe\r\nthat I was wrong to invite him hither. In your unconscious modesty, you\r\nhave not perceived, my child, that Gunther loves you with all the fervor\r\nof a true and honest heart. He may have indulged the thought that I\r\nwould bestow my daughter upon a poor little imperial secretary, whose\r\nbrother enjoys the privilege of blacking the emperor's boots. Although I\r\nlaugh at this presumption, I pity his infatuation, for he is an\r\nexcellent young man. Be careful--or rather, receive him no longer. You\r\nsee, Rachel, that toward an estimable man, I do not encourage coquetry;\r\non the contrary, I plead for poor Gunther. He must not be exposed to a\r\ndisappointment. It is understood, then, that you decline his visits.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled kindly upon his daughter, and left the room.\r\n\r\nRachel looked after him with lips half parted, and face as pale as\r\nmarble. She stood motionless until the sound of her father's foot-steps\r\nhad died away: then sinking upon her knees, she buried her face in her\r\nhands, and cried out in accents of despair\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my God! I am to see him no more!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXLIII.\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTESS BAILLOU,\r\n\r\nThe beautiful Countess Baillou was about to give a ball. She had invited\r\nall the haut ton of Vienna, and they had accepted the invitations. And\r\nyet the countess had been but four weeks in the Austrian capital; she\r\nhad no relations there, and none of the aristocracy had ever heard her\r\nname before. But she had come to Vienna provided with letters of\r\nintroduction, and money; and these two keys had opened the saloons of\r\nthe fashionables to the beautiful stranger.\r\n\r\nHer splendid equipage had been seen in the parks, and her magnificent\r\ndiamonds at the theatre. All the young men of fashion had directed their\r\nlorgnettes toward her box, admiring not only her extraordinary beauty,\r\nbut the grace and abandon of her attitude, as she leaned back in her\r\nvelvet arm-chair. She had not long been seated when the door of the box\r\nopened, and a young man entered whom the lady greeted with a cordial\r\nsmile. Every one knew the visitor to be Count Podstadsky-Liechtenstein.\r\nthe richest, haughtiest, and handsomest cavalier in all Vienna.\r\nPodstadsky was the son of a distinguished nobleman, high in the\r\nemperor's favor; he had just returned from his travels, and all the\r\nViennese gallants were eager to imitate him in every thing. To see him\r\nin the box of the beautiful stranger was to fire the ambition of every\r\nman to know her; the more so that the haughty Podstadsky, instead of\r\naccepting a seat, was standing in an attitude of profound respect, which\r\nhe maintained until he took his leave.\r\n\r\nPodstadsky, of course, was assailed with questions in relation to the\r\ncountess. He had known her in Italy as the wife of a wealthy old\r\nnobleman to whom her parents had sacrificed her before she was eighteen.\r\nShe had been sincerely admired in Rome, not only on account of her\r\nbeauty, but of her wit, goodness, and above all of her admirable\r\nbehavior toward her repulsive old husband. Her conduct had been so\r\nexemplary that she had been called \"La contessa del cuore freddo.\"\r\n[Footnote: The countess with the cold heart.] Podstadsky confessed that\r\neven he had been desperately in love with her, but finding her\r\nunapproachable, had left Rome in despair. What then was his delight\r\nwhen, a few moments ago, he had learned from her own lips that she was a\r\nwidow, and had come to spend a season in Vienna!\r\n\r\nThe consequence of this recital was that Podstadsky's young\r\nacquaintances were clamorous for presentation to la contessa. He stepped\r\ninto her box to inform the lady of their wishes, but soon returned with\r\nthe unwelcome tidings that the countess would receive no male visitor\r\nunless he came in the company of a lady. This, of course, increased the\r\nlonging of the gallants tenfold, and the next day when her equipage was\r\nseen coming in the park, it was followed by many an eager horseman,\r\njealous beyond expression of Count Podstadsky, who was admitted to the\r\nblessed privilege of riding near the lady of their thoughts.\r\n\r\nSome days later the young countess left her cards and letters of\r\nintroduction, and as they were from Orsinis, Colonnas, and other\r\ngrandees of Rome, her hotel was crowded with elegant equipages, and she\r\nwas admitted into the charmed circles of the first society in Vienna.\r\n\r\nAs for the furniture of her hotel, it surpassed anything in the city.\r\n\r\nHer orders of every kind had been princely. Her sofas and chairs were of\r\nembroidered satin; her tables of inlaid wood and verde antique; her\r\ncarpets the richest Persian; her paintings and statuary of rarest value.\r\nShe had bespoken several services of gold, and jewellers were revelling\r\nin her orders for parures such as princesses would have been proud to\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nOne quality which the Countess Baillou possessed gave her unbounded\r\npopularity with those whom she patronized. Her purchases were all\r\npromptly paid in new Austrian bank-notes, and tradesman vied with\r\ntradesman as to who should have the privilege of her custom.\r\n\r\nFinally, her palace was furnished, and the day of her ball had dawned.\r\nEvery invitation had been accepted, for the world was curious to see the\r\nsplendors of her fairy abode, and to behold the fairy emerge from the\r\nretreat wherein she had buried herself up to the date of this grand\r\nreception.\r\n\r\nAnd now the long suites were lit up, and room after room was one blazing\r\nsea of light, gold, crystal, bronze, and marble. Here and there were\r\ncharming boudoirs, where those who were weary of splendor could retire\r\nto converse in the soft, subdued light that was shed upon them from\r\nveiled lamps. The whole was closed by magnificent conservatories, where\r\nflourished the flowers and fruits of every clime; where tropical birds\r\nwere seen fluttering among the branches of the orange-trees, or dipping\r\ntheir beaks in the classic basins of the fountains that were gently\r\nplashing there.\r\n\r\nThe countess had just emerged from her dressing-room. Her dress for the\r\nevening was of white satin, and the coronal of brilliants which flashed\r\namong the braids of her black hair was worthy to be the bridal-diadem of\r\na queen. The Countess Baillou was tall and stately in her beauty, hers\r\nwas the fascination of the dark-eyed Italian, united to the majesty of a\r\ndaughter of ancient Rome, and the union was irresistible. Her throat was\r\nslender, her head small, and her classic oval face was of a pale, pearly\r\nhue, without a tinge of the rose, which, while it lends animation to a\r\nwoman's face, detracts from the camelia-like purity of genuine patrician\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nThe countess glided across the room, and throwing back her head took a\r\ncritical survey of her apartments. They presented a combination of taste\r\nwith magnificence, and their mistress was satisfied.\r\n\r\nShe turned to her steward, who was breathlessly awaiting the result of\r\nhis lady's inspection. \"Not bad,\" said she, in a rich, melodious voice.\r\n\"I am quite pleased with your labors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will my lady walk through the rooms to see the conservatories?\" asked\r\nthe steward.\r\n\r\n\"Why so?\" replied she, with indifference. \"I have no doubt that all is\r\nas it should be, I am too weary of splendor to take much interest in it.\r\nSee, however, that the tables are spread with every luxury that can\r\ntempt the palates of my guests.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope your ladyship will be satisfied. The two cooks from Paris\r\nprofess, the one to have learned his art under the Prince de Soubise,\r\nthe other to have received his receipts for pastry from the Duke de\r\nRichelieu?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let them both do their best,\" said the countess, languidly, \"and\r\nremember that expense is to be no obstacle to the carrying out of my\r\norders.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words she dismissed the steward, and sank back into the\r\nrecesses of an arm-chair. But when he had fairly left, and she knew that\r\nshe was alone, her aspect changed. She rose quickly from the chair, and\r\nwalked through her rooms, surveying their splendor with visible\r\nexultation.\r\n\r\nHow peerless was her beauty as she swept through those empty rooms, her\r\ndiamonds reflected from mirror to mirror, her rich dress falling in\r\nheavy folds about her form! He who had seen her there would have taken\r\nher for the princess who had just awakened from her hundred years'\r\nsleep, looking around her palatial solitude to see who it was that had\r\nbroken the spell of her enchanted trance. Her face was lit up with\r\ntriumph as she went, and at times, when something of rare value met her\r\neyes, in the ecstasy of her pride she laughed aloud.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the stillness was broken by the sound of a man's footstep. The\r\nlaugh of the countess ceased, and she drew on her mask of indifference.\r\nShe turned slowly around, and dropped it again--for the intruder was\r\nCount Podstadsky.\r\n\r\nJust in the midst of the dancing room, tender the blaze of a crystal\r\nchandelier, they met. The countess gave him her hand, and he grasped it\r\nin his own, looking earnestly at her fair, bewitching face. She returned\r\nthe glance with her large, flashing eyes, and so they stood for a time\r\ntogether. There was a secret between those two.\r\n\r\nThe countess spoke first. Her mouth relaxed into a scornful smile.\r\n\"Count Carl von Podstadsky-Liechtenstein,\" said she, \"you are a man, and\r\nyet you tremble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Arabella, I tremble, but not for myself. As I look upon you, in\r\nthe fulness of your incomparable beauty, my blood freezes with terror,\r\nand a voice whispers to me, 'Have mercy on this woman whose beauty is so\r\nakin to that of angels! You both stand upon the edge of a precipice:\r\nshield her at least from the ruin which threatens you!'\"\r\n\r\nThe countess raised her snowy shoulders. \"German sentimentality,\" said\r\nshe. \"If you mix sentiment with your cards, we shall lose the game,\r\nCount Podstadsky. Hear, then, what I have to say to you. It is true that\r\nwe stand upon the brow of a precipice; but we must contemplate it\r\nfearlessly, and so we shall grow accustomed to our danger, and learn to\r\nescape it. Why do you wish to rescue me, Carl? I do not wish to be\r\nrescued. I like the giddy brink, and look down with defiance into the\r\nabyss that blackens the future before me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me some of your courage,\" sighed the count. \"Let me drink\r\nconfidence from the depths of your fearless, flashing eyes, my angel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Angel!\" said Arabella, with a mocking laugh. \"If so, call me your\r\nfallen angel; for when I took the unfathomable leap which leads from\r\ninnocence to guilt, your arms were outstretched to receive me. But\r\npshaw! what bootless retrospection! I am here, Carl, true as steel;\r\nready to stand or fall at your side. Feel my hand, it is warm--feel my\r\npulse, it beats as evenly as though I had never slept a night out of\r\nEden.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a heroine, Arabella. The magnificence around us affrights my\r\ncowardly soul; while you--surely I heard your silvery laugh when I\r\nentered this room awhile ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure you did, faint-hearted knight of the card-table! I laughed\r\nfor joy when I thought of former misery; and compared it with present\r\nsplendor; the more so, that I am the bold architect who raised the\r\nedifice of my own fortune. We need not be grateful to Heaven for our\r\nluck, Carl, for we are not in favor with the celestial aristocracy; we\r\nhave no one to thank for our blessings but ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"And will have no one to thank but ourselves when ruin overtakes us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly,\" said Arabella, with a shrug. \"But remember that we have\r\nalready been shipwrecked, and have not only saved ourselves, but have\r\nbrought glorious spoils with us to shore. So away with your misgivings!\r\nthey do not become the career you have chosen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right, Arabella, right. They do not, indeed! But promise me that I\r\nshall always have you at my side to share my fate, whatever it bring\r\nforth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise,\" said she, raising her starry eyes to his, and clasping with\r\nher small, firm hand his cold and clammy fingers. \"By the memory of\r\nRome, and the dark-rolling waters of the Tiber, from which you rescued\r\nme that night, I promise. And now let us pledge each other in a draught\r\nfrom the depths of the Styx. Look around you, Carl, and realize that all\r\nthis magnificence is ours, and to-night I play the hostess to the proud\r\naristocracy of Vienna. But one question before the curtain rises. How\r\ngoes the affair with the banker's lovely Rachel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gloriously! She loves me, for she has consented to receive me day after\r\nto-morrow, during her father's absence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go, then, and the blessings of your fallen angel go with you! Play your\r\ngame cautiously, and let us hear the chink of Herr Eskeles Flies' gold\r\nnear the rustling of our fragile bank-notes. And now go. Return in half\r\nan hour, that I may receive you in presence of our fastidious guests.\r\nThey might not approve of this tete-a-tete, for you are said to be a sad\r\nprofligate, Carl!\"\r\n\r\nShe kissed her little jewelled hand, and while her Carl disappeared\r\nthrough a secret door on one side of the room, she glided forward with\r\ngrace and elegance inimitable, to receive the high-born ladies who were\r\njust then passing the portals of her princely abode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXLIV.\r\n\r\nTHE EXPULSION OF THE CLARISSERINES.\r\n\r\nThe stroke so long apprehended by the church had fallen. Joseph had\r\nthrown down the gauntlet, and had dealt his first blow at the chair of\r\nSt. Peter. This blow was directed toward the chief pastors of the\r\nAustrian church--the bishops. Their allegiance, spiritual as well as\r\ntemporal, was due to the emperor alone, and no order emanating from Rome\r\ncould take effect without first being submitted for his approval. The\r\nbishops were to be reinstated in their ancient rights, and they alone\r\nwere to grant marriage dispensations and impose penances.\r\n\r\nBut this was only one step in the new \"reformation\" of the Emperor\r\nJoseph. He dissociated all spiritual communities whatever from\r\nconnection with foreign superiors, and freed them from all dependence\r\nupon them. They were to receive their orders from native bishops alone,\r\nand these in their turn were to promulgate no spiritual edict without\r\nthe approbation and permission of the reigning sovereign of Austria.\r\n\r\nThese ordinances did away with the influence of the head of the church\r\nin Austria, but they did not sufficiently destroy that of the clergy\r\nover their flocks. This, too, must be annihilated; and now every thing\r\nwas ready for the great final blow which was to crush to the earth every\r\nvestige of church influence within the dominions of Joseph the Second.\r\nThis last stroke was the dispersion of the religious communities. Monks\r\nand nuns should be forced to work with the people. They were no longer\r\nto he permitted to devote their lives to solitary prayer, and every\r\ncontemplative order was suppressed.\r\n\r\nThe cry of horror which issued from the convents was echoed throughout\r\nthe land, from palace to hovel. The people were more indignant--they\r\nwere terror-stricken; for the emperor was not only an unbeliever\r\nhimself, he was forcing his people to unbelief. The very existence of\r\nreligion, said they, was threatened by his tyranny and impiety.\r\n\r\nJoseph heard all this and laughed it to scorn. \"When the priests cease\r\ntheir howls,\" said he, \"the people, too, will stop, and they will thank\r\nme for what I am doing. When they see that the heavens have not fallen\r\nbecause a set of silly nuns are startled from their nests, they will\r\ncome to their senses, and perceive that I have freed them from a load of\r\nreligious prejudices.\"\r\n\r\nBut the people were not of that opinion. They hated the imperial\r\nfreethinker who with his brutal hands was thrusting out helpless women\r\nfrom their homes, and was robbing the very altars of their sacred\r\nvessels, to convert them into money for his own profane uses.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, did not prevent the execution of the order for the\r\nexpulsion of the nuns. In spite of priests and people, the decree was\r\ncarried out on the 12th of January, of the year 1782. A multitude had\r\nassembled before the convent of the Clarisserines whence the sisters\r\nwere about to be expelled, and where the sacred vessels and vestments\r\nappertaining to the altars were to be exposed for sale at auction!\r\n\r\nThousands of men were there, with anxious looks fixed upon the gates of\r\nthe convent before which the deputies of the emperor, in full uniform,\r\nstood awaiting the key which the prioress was about to deliver into\r\ntheir hands. Not far off, the public auctioneers were seated at a table\r\nwith writing-materials, and around them swarmed a crowd of Jewish\r\ntradesmen eagerly awaiting the sale!\r\n\r\n\"See them,\" said a priest to the multitude, \"see those hungry Jews,\r\nhovering like vultures over the treasures of the church! They will drink\r\nfrom the chalice that has held the blood of the Lord, and the pix which\r\nhas contained his body they will convert into coin! Alas! alas! The\r\nemperor, who has enfranchised the Jew, has disfranchised the Christian!\r\nUnhappy servants of the Most High! ye are driven from His temple, that\r\nusurers and extortioners may buy and sell where once naught was to be\r\nheard but praise and worship of Jehovah!\"\r\n\r\nThe people had come nearer to listen, and when the priest ceased, their\r\nfaces grew dark and sullen, and their low mutterings were heard like the\r\ndistant murmurings of a coming storm, while many a hand was clinched at\r\nthe Jews, who were laughing and chattering together, greatly enjoying\r\nthe scene.\r\n\r\n\"We will not permit it, father,\" cried a young burgher, \"we will not\r\nallow the sacred vessels to be bought and sold!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we will not allow it,\" echoed the people.\r\n\r\n\"You cannot prevent it,\" replied the priest, \"for the emperor is\r\nabsolute master here. Neither can you prevent the expulsion of the pious\r\nClarisserines from the home which was purchased for them with the funds\r\nof the church. Well! Let us be patient. If the Lord of Heaven and Earth\r\ncan suffer it, so can we. But see--they come--the victims of an\r\nunbelieving sovereign!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the priest pointed to the convent-gates through which the procession\r\nhad begun to pass. At their head came the prioress in the white garb of\r\nher order, her head enveloped in a long veil, her face pale and\r\nconvulsed with suffering, and her hands, which held a golden crucifix,\r\ntightly clasped over her breast. Following her in pairs came the nuns,\r\nfirst those who had grown gray in the service of the Lord, then the\r\nyoung ones, and finally the novices.\r\n\r\nThe people looked with heart-felt sympathy at the long, sad procession\r\nwhich, silent as spectres, wound through the grounds of the home which\r\nthey were leaving forever.\r\n\r\nThe imperial commissioners gave the sign to halt, while, their eyes\r\nblinded by tears, the people gazed upon the face of the venerable\r\nprioress, who, obedient to the emperor's cruel decree, was yielding up\r\nthe keys and the golden crucifix. She gave her keys with a firm hand;\r\nbut when she relinquished the emblem of her office and of her faith, the\r\ncourage of the poor old woman almost deserted her. She offered it, as\r\nthe commissioner extended his hand, she shrank involuntarily, and once\r\nmore pressed the cross to her quivering lips. Then, raising it on high,\r\nas if to call upon Heaven to witness the sacrilege, she bowed her head\r\nand relinquished it forever.\r\n\r\nPerhaps she had hoped for an interposition from Heaven; but alas! no\r\nsign was given, and the sacrifice was complete.\r\n\r\nThe priest who had addressed the crowd, advanced to the prioress.\r\n\r\n\"Whither are you going, my daughter?\" said he.\r\n\r\nThe prioress raised her head, and stared at him with vacant, tearless\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"We must go into the wide, wide world,\" replied she. \"The emperor has\r\nforbidden us to serve the Lord.\"\r\n\r\n\"The emperor intends you to become useful members of society,\" said a\r\nvoice among the crowd. \"The emperor intends that you shall cease your\r\neverlasting prayers, and turn your useless hands to some account.\r\nInstead of living on your knees, he intends to force you to become\r\nhonest wives and mothers, who shall be of some use to him by bearing\r\nchildren, as you were told to do when your mother Eve was driven from\r\nHER paradise.\"\r\n\r\nEvery head was turned in eager curiosity to discover the speaker of\r\nthese bold words; but in vain, he could not be identified.\r\n\r\n\"But how are you going to live?\" asked the priest, when the murmurs had\r\nceased.\r\n\r\n\"The emperor has given us a pension of two hundred ducats,\" said the\r\nprioress, gently.\r\n\r\n\"But that will not maintain you without--\"\r\n\r\n\"It will maintain honest women who deserve to live,\" cried the same\r\nvoice that had spoken before. \"Ask the people around you how they live,\r\nand whether they have pensions from the crown. And I should like to know\r\nwhether a lazy nun is any better than a peasant's wife? And if you are\r\nafraid of the world, go among the Ursulines who serve the emperor by\r\neducating children. The Ursulines are not to be suppressed.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said some among the crowd; \"why should they not work as well as\r\nwe, or why do they not go among the Ursulines and make themselves\r\nuseful?\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus were the sympathies of the people withdrawn from the unhappy\r\nnuns. They, meanwhile, went their way, chanting as they walked:\r\n\r\n\"Cujus animam gementem, contristanten et dolentem pertransivit gladius.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the Clarisserines were passing from sight, the people, always\r\nswayed by the controlling influence of the moment, returned quietly to\r\ntheir homes.\r\n\r\nThree men with hats drawn over their brows, pressed through the crowd,\r\nand followed the procession at some distance.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said one of the three, \"how a few words were sufficient to\r\nturn the tide of the people's sympathies, and to confound that fanatic\r\npriest in his attempt to create disturbance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which he would have succeeded in doing but for your majesty--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, Lacy, hush! We are laboring men, nothing more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" growled Lacy, \"and you put us to hard labor, too, when you\r\nembarked in this dangerous business. It was a very bold thing to come\r\namong this excited multitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was determined to watch the people, and counteract, if possible, the\r\neffect of the sly blackcoats upon my subjects. Was it not well that I\r\nwas there to rescue them from the miseries of revolt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I think there was danger at of a time that mischief would result\r\nfrom the pious comedy of the prioress.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure there was,\" cried the emperor. \"But this time I won the\r\nfield through a few well-directed words. And now let us go and see the\r\nshow at the two other convents. Perhaps we may come in time to send\r\nanother well-directed arrow in the midst of the sisterhoods.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXLV.\r\n\r\nCOUNT PODSTADSKY'S ESCORT.\r\n\r\n\"You promise that he shall remain but five minutes in my room, father?\"\r\nsaid Rachel.\r\n\r\n\"I give you my word that he shall stay just long enough for me to\r\ncomplete my preparations to escort him home.\"\r\n\r\n\"What mean you, dear father? At least tell me what you intend to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I merely intend a jest, dear child,\" said Eskeles Flies, laughing. \"A\r\njest which shall announce to the people of Vienna that the Jewish banker\r\nhas no desire to receive the visits of the Christian count. Ah, eleven\r\no'clock! The hour for your interview. Farewell, my daughter, your lover\r\ncomes.\"\r\n\r\nThe banker disappeared through a tapestry-door, and scarcely had he\r\nclosed it when Count Podstadsky was announced.\r\n\r\nRachel had so unconquerable an aversion to Podstadsky that, instead of\r\ngoing forward to greet him, she actually stepped back and raised her\r\nhand as if to ward him off. But the count was not easily repulsed.\r\n\r\n\"At last, my angel,\" said he, \"my hour of happiness is here--at last you\r\nare mine. And I am the happiest of mortals.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who tells you that I am yours?\" said Rachel, still retreating.\r\n\r\n\"Yourself, my houri, when you consent to receive me alone. How shall I\r\nprove to you the extent of my adoration?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you can easily do that,\" said Rachel, \"by becoming a Jew for the\r\nlove of me.\"\r\n\r\nAt the idea of his becoming a Jew, Podstadsky burst out into a fit of\r\nlaughter; but Rachel affected not to hear it.\r\n\r\n\"You know that by becoming a Jew,\" continued she, \"you would be at\r\nliberty to marry me, and inherit my father's ducats.\"\r\n\r\nAt mention of her father's wealth Podstadsky felt that he had laughed\r\ntoo soon. The thought of the banker's millions made him feel rather\r\ngrave. They were worth any thing short of such a lese noblesse as\r\napostasy.\r\n\r\n\"What to me are your father's ducats?\" cried he, vehemently. \"I love\r\nnothing here but his daughter, and my love is sufficient for me. I ask\r\nnothing but the priceless treasure of your heart. Come, sweet one,\r\ncome!\"\r\n\r\n\"Away with you!\" cried Rachel, unable to endure his insolence longer.\r\n\"If I have permitted you to sully the purity of my home with your\r\npresence, it was that I might tell you once for all how I despise you!\r\nNow, begone, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And allow me to accompany you home,\" said a mocking voice behind; and\r\nas Podstadsky turned with a start to see whence it came, he met the\r\nfiery black eyes of Eskeles Flies, who approached with a tall wax-light\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\nThe count trembled inwardly, but recovering his self-possession, he\r\nasked, with a haughty smile: \"Are we in the carnival, and do you\r\nrepresent the Israelitish god of love?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, count,\" said the banker, \"and his torch shall light you home, lest\r\nyou stumble on your way, and fall into the pit of dishonor. Come and\r\nreceive the ovation prepared for you.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Eskeles Flies opened the door, and the count looked out with\r\ndismay.\r\n\r\nThe long hall was lined on both sides with the liveried servants of the\r\nbanker, each holding in his hand a wax-light, whose yellow flame flared\r\nto and fro, as the air from the open door below came in fitful puffs up\r\nthe wide marble staircase.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said the banker, advancing with his flambeau. Podstadsky\r\nhesitated. If his sense of honor was dead, his vanity was not; and it\r\nwinced at the slightest touch of ridicule. Was there no escape from this\r\nabsurd escort? He looked around and saw no hope of rescue. Behind him\r\nRachel had locked the door, and the servants were so closely ranged\r\ntogether that it was vain to attempt a passage through that living wall\r\nof fire. He had no alternative but to laugh derisively and step into the\r\nranks. The procession moved on, and gathered strength as it moved; for\r\non the staircase in the lower hall, and at the front of the house, they\r\nwere joined by throng after throng, each man of which, like the\r\ncommander-in-chief, was armed with a flambeau. This was bad enough of\r\nitself, but the count's body-guard were all in a titter, and every man\r\nenjoyed the jest except himself.\r\n\r\nBy this time they had reached the street, and what was the rage and\r\nmortification of the proud Austrian grandee, when he saw that curiosity\r\nhad drawn thither a concourse of people, who kept up with the\r\nprocession, wondering what on earth could be the meaning of it!\r\n[Footnote: This scene is historical. See \"Letters of a French\r\nTraveller,\" vol. i., p. 405. Frieders \"Letters from Vienna,\" vol. ii.,\r\np. 30.]\r\n\r\n\"See,\" cried one, \"Herr Eskeles Flies has caught a marten in his\r\nhen-roost and is lighting him home.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the marten is the fine Count Podstadsky-Liechtenstein,\" cried\r\nanother. \"I know him. He rejoices in the title of 'woman-killer.' Only\r\nlook how he sneaks along as the tribe of Israel are dogging him home!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Israelites are escorting him home,\" jeered the multitude, and the\r\nprocession moved on, never stopping until it reached the count's own\r\nhotel. Once there, Eskeles Flies, in a loud voice, bade him adieu, and\r\nrequested to know whether he should accompany him farther.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Count Podstadsky, trembling with passion, \"and you shall\r\nanswer to me for this outrage. We shall see whether the unbelieving Jew\r\ncan mock the Christian with impunity!\"\r\n\r\n\"Accuse me before the public tribunals,\" answered the banker, \"and I\r\nshall enter MY complaint against you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" said Podstadsky, contemptuously. \"The Jew will be allowed to\r\naccuse an Austrian nobleman, will he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, by the God of Israel, he will,\" replied Eskeles Flies, so loud\r\nthat his voice was heard by the people around. \"Yes, thanks to the\r\nemperor, his subjects before the law are all equal, and Jew and\r\nChristian are alike amenable to its judgments. Long live Joseph the\r\nSecond, the father of his people!\"\r\n\r\n\"Long live the father of his people!\" shouted the fickle multitude; and\r\nglad that the attention of the crowd had been diverted from himself,\r\nCount Podstadsky-Liechtenstein slunk away to ruminate over the\r\nmortifying occurrences of the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXLVI.\r\n\r\nTHE LAMPOON.\r\n\r\nThe emperor, with his confidential secretary, had been at work through\r\nthe entire night. Day had dawned, and still he wrote on, nor seemed to\r\nbe conscious of the hour. In his restless zeal, he felt no fatigue, no\r\nexhaustion, nor yet any excitement, and not until the last document had\r\nbeen read and signed, did he rise from his chair to take a few turns\r\naround the room, while Gunther was sorting the papers, and placing them\r\nin a portfolio.\r\n\r\n\"Gunther,\" said the emperor, \"what is the matter? You look pale and\r\nsuffering.\"\r\n\r\nGunther raised his head, and smiled. \"Nothing, sire, is the matter, but\r\nwant of rest. A few hours' sleep will restore me\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so, Gunther; you belie yourself when you say so, for never in my\r\nlife have I seen such an indefatigable worker as you. Ah! you look down,\r\nso that I know you are not frank with me. Come, have you no confidence\r\nin me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sire, I have the most unbounded confidence in your goodness; but\r\nsince you force me to speak, I am uneasy about yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so, Gunther?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because, your majesty strides forward in your projects of reform\r\nwithout the least apprehension of the danger that attends such changes.\r\nYou rush through the flames without ever dreaming that they may some day\r\nconsume you.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor shrugged his shoulders. \"Always the same song--an echo of\r\nLacy and Rosenberg. I have no time to temporize as you would advise me\r\nto do. Who knows how long I shall live to carry out my own free will?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, if your majesty works as you have done of late, your chance\r\nfor life is not very great. You seem to forget that mind is subordinate\r\nto matter--not matter to mind--that physical nature must have her\r\nrights, and no man can withstand her exactions. Pardon me these bold\r\nwords, sire, but if I speak at all, I must speak the truth. You have\r\nbegun a gigantic edifice, and if you die, it must remain forever\r\nincomplete.\"\r\n\r\n\"For that very reason, I must complete it myself; for, indeed, Gunther,\r\nyou are right--when I die, I leave no man worthy to succeed to my\r\nstupendous undertakings. I shall, therefore, live until I have\r\naccomplished them all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then your majesty must work less,\" exclaimed Gunther, warmly. \"You do\r\nnot believe that in pleading for you, sire, I give one thought to\r\nmyself, for nothing is too laborious for me when I work for my emperor.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph laid his hand softly upon Gunther's shoulder. \"I believe you,\r\nGunther. I esteem you as one of my best friends, and well you know that\r\nfrom you I have no political secrets.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would sooner die than betray your majesty, even unwittingly,\" said\r\nGunther, looking with his large, honest eyes into the emperor's face.\r\n\r\n\"I know it, Gunther; but as you enjoy my confidence without reserve, you\r\nought to know that I have too much to do to think of rest. Oh, it would\r\nbe dreadful for me to die before my structure is complete! Gunther,\r\nGunther, the priests would transform my fairy palace into a gloomy\r\nchurch; and from its towers, in lieu of the noble clock which is to\r\nstrike the hour of reformation for my people, would frown the cross that\r\nis the symbol of the unenlightened past. Oh, let me not hear in my dying\r\nmoments the crash of the temple I would rear to Truth!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then recreate your mind, sire, with literature or art. It is long since\r\nthe speaking tones of your violoncello have been heard in the palace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true, Gunther, but I cannot invite the Muses into my study. A\r\nprince has no right to associate with such frivolous ladies, for he is\r\nnot on earth to pass away time. The King of Prussia heads a royal sect\r\nwho devote themselves to authorship. The Empress of Russia follows after\r\nhim with Voltaire in her hand. I cannot emulate their literary\r\ngreatness. I read to learn, and travel to enlarge my ideas; and I\r\nflatter myself that as I encourage men of letters, I do them a greater\r\nservice than I would, were I to sit at a desk and help them to weave\r\nsonnets. [Footnote: The emperor's own words. \"Letters of Joseph,\" p.\r\n67.] So let us eschew Apollo and his light-footed companions; I aim to\r\nbe nothing but an imperial statesman. But,\" continued the emperor,\r\nfrowning, \"I get little sympathy from my subjects. Counsellors, nobles,\r\nburghers, priests, all heap obstacle upon obstacle in my path, and the\r\nwork advances slowly. The revenues, too, are inadequate to the state.\r\nThe financial affairs of the crown are disordered, and it is only by the\r\nstrictest economy that I am able to sustain the army. The people call me\r\na miser, because Maria Theresa's prodigality of expenditure forces upon\r\nme measures of retrenchment, and necessitates unusual expedients for the\r\nraising of funds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which unhappily were extorted from convents and shrines.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unhappily! HAPPILY, you mean to say. The treasures which were wasted on\r\nconvent-chapels and shrines, have saved us from bankruptcy; and God will\r\nlook down with favor upon the sacrifice which dead superstition has made\r\nto living love, and will bestow a blessing upon the work of my hands!\r\nTrue, those heroes of darkness, the monks and priests, will cry\r\nAnathema! and the earth will be filled with their howls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like that which greeted Alcides, when he stormed the gates of\r\nTartarus,\" said Gunther, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"You are right. The work is worthy of Alcides, but with the blessing of\r\nGod it shall be done. Little care I for the wail of nuns or the groans\r\nof priests; let them shriek and tear their hair, or, if they like it\r\nbetter, let them vent their spleen in lampoons and caricatures. See,\r\nGunther, what a compliment I received yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the emperor drew from his escritoire a paper which he unfolded.\r\n\"Look at this. It takes off one of my great crimes. You know I have\r\ndeprived the court of the privilege of living in the palace, and I have\r\ngiven them wherewith to find lodgings in the city. Here go the ladies\r\nwith their bundles under their arms, and the lord high-steward has a\r\nbroom sweeping after them as they go. This charming individual in the\r\ncorner with a hunting-whip, is myself. And here is the pith of the joke.\r\n'Rooms to let here. Inquire of the proprietor on the first floor.'\r\n[Footnote: Hubner, i., p. 190.] What do you think of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Abominable! Inconceivable!\" ejaculated Gunther. \"As unjust as it is\r\nstinging.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does not sting me. I have a sound hide. When it itches it is cured\r\nby scratching. [Footnote: Joseph's own words.] Here is another\r\npasquinade. It was thrown before my horse's feet as I was riding in the\r\npark.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Joseph Premier, aimable et charmant: Joseph Seconde, scorpion et\r\ntyran.'\"\r\n\r\n\"How can your majesty laugh at such unparalleled insolence?\" cried the\r\nindignant secretary.\r\n\r\n\"No one can deny that I have stung priests and nuns,\" said Joseph,\r\nlaughing, \"so they are welcome to roar, since their tongues are the only\r\nweapons wherewith they may revenge themselves upon their tyrant. As I\r\nhave proclaimed freedom of speech and press, you see they take advantage\r\nof the privilege.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if your majesty takes so magnanimous a view of these insulting\r\nlampoons,\" said Gunther, drawing a paper from his pocket, \"I must show\r\nyou one which yesterday was posted on the wall of the Konigskloster.\"\r\n\r\n\"So the Konigskloster irritates the servants of the lord, does it?\"\r\nlaughed Joseph. \"They cannot forgive me for selling it to the banker\r\nFlies, to transfigure into a Jewish palace!--Well, let us see the\r\npasquinade!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, my tongue refuses to pronounce the words,\" replied Gunther,\r\nhanding it to the emperor.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, you must accustom your tongue to pronounce them, for we are likely\r\nto have many more of the same sort to read. So go on, and speak out\r\nboldly.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor threw himself into an arm-chair, and making himself\r\ncomfortable, prepared to listen.\r\n\r\nThe lampoon denounced him as the persecutor of the brides of the Lord,\r\nand the enemy of the church. It accused him of having converted a holy\r\ntemple into the abode of sin, that he might gratify his greed for money.\r\n\r\nWhen Gunther had concluded, he cried out impatiently, \"This time at\r\nleast your majesty will show your enemies that forbearance has its\r\nlimits, and that the liberty of the press shall not degenerate into\r\nlicense.\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means. That would look as if I were afraid. I commission you to\r\nhave the lampoon reprinted and to expose it for sale in the bookstores\r\nat six kreutzers a copy, the proceeds to be given to the poor.\"\r\n[Footnote: Historical.]\r\n\r\n\"Oh that your majesty's enemies were here to sink with shame at your\r\nfeet, and beg your forgiveness!\" cried Gunther.\r\n\r\n\"Hush,\" said Joseph. \"Were my enemies to hear you, they would liken me\r\nto other princes, who make a parade of their good qualities so that\r\nflatterers may immortalize them in laudatory dithyrambics.--But the time\r\nfor chatting and resting has expired,\" continued Joseph, rising from his\r\nchair. \"The labors of the day call me. I must go to receive my\r\npetitioners, who must be weary with waiting, for I am a quarter of an\r\nhour behind the time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXLVII.\r\n\r\nTHE PETITIONERS.\r\n\r\nThe wide corridor in which Joseph was accustomed receive his petitioners\r\nwas crowded. People of all ages and conditions were there, waiting with\r\ntrembling impatience the appearance of the emperor, who received the\r\napplications of his subjects every day from nine o'clock until twelve.\r\nSuddenly a commotion was perceptible among the crowd, and a pressure was\r\nfelt toward the door which led to the cabinet of the emperor. The ears\r\nof those who have suits to urge are keen; and every one of that motley\r\nthrong heard the footsteps of him who held their destinies in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and Joseph was before them. At once every hand that\r\nheld a paper was eagerly stretched forward. The emperor went from one to\r\nanother, and, while he collected their petitions, entered into friendly\r\nconverse with the applicants.\r\n\r\nThe last petitioner was an old man in the garb of a Hungarian peasant.\r\nHis white hair fell in locks from beneath his wide-brimmed hat of dark\r\nbrown, and the cloak which was thrown carelessly over his stalwart\r\nshoulders was embroidered with shells and silver spangles. His sun-burnt\r\nface was free from the Runic characters which the slow finger of Time is\r\napt to trace upon the brow of the human race; and but for the color of\r\nhis hair, he would have been mistaken for a man in the prime of life.\r\n\r\nThe emperor was favorably struck with his bearing, and smiled with more\r\nthan usual benignity.\r\n\r\n\"Whence come you?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"From Hungary, sire,\" replied the peasant, with a smile that revealed\r\ntwo rows of regular, white teeth. \"I was one week on my journey; at\r\nnight the open field my bed, and by day a drink of water more than once\r\nmy only breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must have had important business in Vienna.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire. I was sent with this petition to your majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be urgent, to have induced you to travel so far.\"\r\n\r\n\"Urgent, indeed, sire. I promised the peasants of our district to give\r\nit into your majesty's own hand. It has the name of every man in the\r\ndistrict; but if I had had time to go around with it, I might have\r\nbrought with me the name of every peasant in Hungary. It was arranged\r\nthat I should present the petition this morning, and now, while we stand\r\nhere, every man, woman, and child at home is praying for my success. \"\r\n\r\n\"What can I do for you? Speak, and if possible, I will grant your\r\npetition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, your majesty, read it aloud, that I may say to my brethren, that\r\nour cry of distress has reached the imperial ear.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph smiled, and opening the paper, read aloud:\r\n\r\n\"Compassionate emperor! Four days of hard labor as socmen; the fifth day\r\nat the fisheries; the sixth day following our lords in the hunt--the\r\nseventh day is the Lord's. Judge, then, whether we are able to pay our\r\ntaxes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" murmured the man to himself, \"he cannot say that if we are\r\noppressed, he knows nothing of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not say so, my friend,\" said the emperor, with emotion. \"The\r\nwhole history of your wrongs is written in these few touching lines. I\r\nknow that you are oppressed, and that, when you sink with exhaustion at\r\nyour tasks, you are roused with the lash. I know that you are treated\r\nlike cattle, that you have neither property nor rights, and that\r\nagriculture suffers sorely from the obstacles which your masters place\r\nin your paths. I know all; and by the God above us, to whom your wives\r\nand children are even now at prayer, I swear to free the Hungarian serf\r\nfrom bondage!\"\r\n\r\n\"To free the Hungarian serf!\" shouted the peasant. \"Do I hear aright?\r\nDoes your majesty promise freedom to the Hungarian serf?\"\r\n\r\n\"As God hears me, I will free him,\" replied the emperor, solemnly.\r\n\"Servitude shall cease, and free socage shall replace villeinage. Your\r\ntax-bill shall be revised, and your rights guaranteed by the crown. If,\r\nafter this, you are oppressed, come confidently to me, and your tyrants\r\nshall be punished; for under my reign all men shall be equal before the\r\nlaw.\"\r\n\r\nThe peasant sank on his knees and looked up with glistening eyes. \"Oh,\r\nmy lord and emperor,\" said he, \"I had heard of tears of joy, but, until\r\nto-day, I knew not what they meant. I have been scourged for refusing to\r\nkneel to my lord; but I bend the knee to you for I feel that you are a\r\nmighty sovereign and a merciful father to your people. God bless you for\r\nthe words by which you have recognized our right to live and to be\r\nfree!\"\r\n\r\nHe bent down and kissed the emperor's feet; then rising, he said\r\n\"Farewell, gracious lord of Hungary. I must return home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you not remain a day or two to see the beauties of Vienna?\" asked\r\nthe emperor.\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty. I carry too much joy with me to tarry on my way; and\r\nwhat could I see in Vienna to rival the snow-white mountains that mirror\r\nthemselves in the blue lakes of Hungary?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, at least, take this purse to defray your expenses.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your majesty, I cannot take gold to defray the expenses of a holy\r\npilgrimage. Farewell! And may the blessings of a grateful people be\r\nechoed for you in heaven!\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor laid his hand upon the peasant's shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me the name of my Hungarian friend!\"\r\n\r\n\"My name? It is Horja, [Footnote: Unhappy Horja! This sentimental\r\ninterview cost him his life.] sire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, then, Horja; let me hear from you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXLVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE PETITIONERS.\r\n\r\nAs the door closed behind Horja, the emperor continued his rounds, but\r\nno more petitions were presented. Here and there, however, was heard a\r\nrequest for an audience, which Joseph granted, and then retired to his\r\ncabinet, leaving the door open.\r\n\r\n\"Have the goodness to walk in,\" said he to the lady, who was in advance\r\nof the others. She obeyed, and the emperor, closing the door, took a\r\nseat at his escritoire.\r\n\r\n\"Now, madam, I am ready to hear you; but, as there are nine persons to\r\nfollow, I must request you to be brief. What is your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am the widow of the President von Kahlbaum.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was a worthy man. Have you any children, madam?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty; I have two daughters and a son.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two daughters? I once had a little maiden of my own, but she is dead,\"\r\nsaid the emperor, sadly. \"How can I serve you and your children?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sire, the fearful ordinance by which the pensions from her late\r\nmajesty's privy-purse were withdrawn, has ruined me. I beseech of you,\r\nsire, restore to me my pension extraordinary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you not aware that the pensions extraordinary are abolished?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire; but through your majesty's liberality, I hope to retain the\r\npension I held from the empress. The loss of it heightens my grief for\r\nthe death of my husband, and makes life unendurable. Without it I should\r\nhave to part with my carriage, with a portion of my household, and live\r\nin complete retirement. I am sure that your majesty's own sense of\r\njustice will plead for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Justice is the motive power of all my actions, madam,\" replied the\r\nemperor, curtly, \"and for that very reason you cannot retain your\r\npension.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, I am sorely stricken. The merits of my husband--my position--\"\r\n\r\n\"Your husband's merits have earned you the pension you already receive\r\nfrom the crown; and as for your position, that can in no way concern me.\r\nI grant that your loss is great; but your special pension will maintain\r\nthree poor families, and I cannot allow you to receive it longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" cried the lady, \"what are my daughters to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"They can become good house-keepers or governesses, if they have\r\nreceived good educations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible, sire. My daughters are of noble birth, and they cannot\r\ndescend to the humiliation of earning a living.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? I am sure I earn my living, and earn it by hard work, too. No\r\none is too good to work; and since the aristocracy cannot shield their\r\nchildren from want, it is clear that they cannot free them from the\r\nnecessity of labor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, your majesty, have mercy upon my son--the only son of a man of\r\nnoble extraction.\"\r\n\r\n\"What profession has he chosen?\"\r\n\r\n\"He wishes to be an officer in the army; but he was so severely dealt\r\nwith in his examination, that he has not been able to obtain a\r\ncommission. Oh, your majesty, I beseech of you, grant him a command in\r\nthe infantry!\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" cried the emperor, impatiently, \"a man may be the son of a\r\ndistinguished father without having the slightest claim to serve as an\r\nofficer. As your son was not able to stand his examination, he must\r\ncontent himself with being the 'son of a man of noble extraction.'\r\nExcuse me, but time is limited. I regret to refuse your requests, but\r\njustice compels me to do so.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady burst into tears, and making her inclination to the emperor,\r\nleft the room. The latter, following her, said, \"Let the next petitioner\r\nadvance.\"\r\n\r\nThis was an old hussar, a captain of cavalry, with lofty bearing and\r\nsnow-white beard. He came in, making a military salute.\r\n\r\n\"What can I do for you, my friend?\" asked Joseph.\r\n\r\n\"I come to ask of your majesty not to deprive me of the pension\r\nextraordinary which the empress of blessed memory bestowed upon me from\r\nher privy purse,\" said the old soldier, bluntly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, another pension extraordinary!\" said the emperor, with a laugh.\r\n\"That cannot be, captain. The privy purse of the empress, which, in the\r\ngoodness of her heart, was thrown indiscriminately to all who asked for\r\nalms, this purse exists no longer. It has a large hole in it, and its\r\ncontents have all run out.\"\r\n\r\nThe old hussar gave a grim look to the emperor, and raised his peruke.\r\nPointing with his finger to three wide, purple scars upon his head, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Sire, my head is somewhat in the condition of your privy-purse, it has\r\nseveral holes in it. They were made by your majesty's enemies.\"\r\n\r\n\"To stop such holes as those is my sacred duty,\" said Joseph, smiling,\r\n\"and enough remains yet in the bottom of the privy-purse to satisfy the\r\nwants of a brave officer, who has served me to his own prejudice.\r\nForgive my refusal. The petition which you wear on your head is more\r\neloquent than words, and your pension shall be returned to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank your majesty,\" said the captain, and with another stiff salute,\r\nhe marched out.\r\n\r\nThe emperor looked after him, laughing heartily.\r\n\r\nAs he disappeared, a pale, delicate woman came forward, accompanied by\r\nseveral young children, two of which were hiding their heads in her\r\nskirt. The group filed up the door like a picture, and the children\r\nclung so to the pallid mother that she could not advance a step.\r\n\r\n\"As you cannot come to me, I will go to you,\" said the emperor,\r\ncontemplating them with a benevolent smile. \"Give me your petition,\r\nmadam.\"\r\n\r\n\"These are my petitions, your majesty,\" said the woman pointing to her\r\nchildren. \"My husband served for many years in the twelfth regiment, and\r\ndied of the wounds he received in the Bavarian war. He left me nothing\r\nbut these orphans.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor looked kindly at the little golden heads that were peeping\r\nfrom among the folds of their mother's dress, and a cloud came over his\r\nface. \"You grieve for your poverty, poor woman,\" said he, \"and know not\r\nhow I envy your riches. How many millions would I give if one of those\r\nchildren were mine! Children are a great blessing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire, when they have fathers to work for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will be their father,\" said Joseph, and at the sound of these loving\r\nwords, the children raised their bashful heads, to steal a look at the\r\nspeaker. \"Come, boys,\" continued he, offering his hand, \"will any of you\r\nbe soldiers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" replied the two eldest, standing erect and making the\r\nmilitary salute.\r\n\r\n\"That is right. You are brave fellows, and if you behave well, you shall\r\nbelong to my body-guard.--Come to-morrow,\" continued he to the mother,\r\n\"and the lord-chancellor will attend to the maintenance and education of\r\nyour four eldest. Meanwhile, you shall have a pension for yourself and\r\nthe youngest. In a few years I will do as much for the little one there.\r\nBe punctual in your visit to the chancery. You will be received at ten\r\no'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"God reward your majesty!\" faltered the happy mother. \"Oh, my children,\r\nmy dear children, the emperor is the father of the orphan! Reward your\r\ngracious sovereign by being good, and pray for him with all your\r\nhearts!\"\r\n\r\nWith these words the woman courtesied and withdrew, and the audience for\r\nthat day was at an end.\r\n\r\n\"And pray for him with all your hearts,\" whispered the emperor. \"May God\r\nhear the petitions of these innocents! Perchance they may weigh against\r\nthe curses of others. They are the little roses which I sometimes find\r\nbeneath my crown of thorns. But away with sentiment! I have no time to\r\nindulge in heart-reveries. My vocation is to work. Here is a portfolio\r\nfilled with petitions. Gunther must help me to examine them.\"\r\n\r\nHe rang the bell, and Gunther seated himself and went to work.\r\nMeanwhile, the emperor had taken up one of the papers and was reading\r\nit. Suddenly he put it down and began to laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Gunther,\" said he, \"listen to this touching appeal. One of the\r\ndischarged counselors orders me to give him a larger pension that he may\r\nlive in a manner befitting his position. Now hear the conclusion of the\r\npetition. 'Our emperor is a poor callow mouse.'\" [Footnote: Hubner, i.,\r\np. 199.]\r\n\r\n\"And your majesty can laugh at such insolence!\" exclaimed Gunther,\r\ncoloring with indignation.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do,\" replied Joseph. \"Nothing can be franker and more to the\r\npoint.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I, pardon me, sire, think that the writer of this insolent letter\r\nshould be severely--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" interrupted the emperor. \"You would not have me punish him for\r\nbeing man enough to say to my face what thousands say of me behind my\r\nback, would you? Now, I am so disinclined to punish him that I intend to\r\nincrease his pension just because he is an honest, plain-spoken fellow.\r\nYou need not make such a grimace, Gunther. If you feel badly, console\r\nyourself with your work.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor seated himself at the table and went on looking over his\r\npetitions, occasionally murmuring to himself, \"Our emperor is a poor,\r\ncallow mouse!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CXLIX.\r\n\r\nTHE LADY PATRONESS.\r\n\r\nThe days of the Countess Baillou glided away in one continued round of\r\npleasure. She was the cynosure of all eyes at concert, ball, or\r\nfestival. Even women ceased to envy the conquering beauty, and seemed to\r\nthink it just that all mankind should succumb to her unparalleled\r\nattractions. The emperor had shared the common enthusiasm, and, at a\r\nball given by Prince Esterbazy, had danced twice with the countess.\r\nThose therefore who, through their rank or station, were ambitious of\r\nthe emperor's presence at their entertainments, hastened one and all to\r\nissue pressing invitations to the enchantress of whom their sovereign\r\nhad said that she was the most fascinating woman in Vienna.\r\n\r\nCount Podstadsky-Liechtenstein was about to give a ball, and the\r\nCountess Baillou had consented to receive his guests. It would perhaps\r\nhave been more natural that the mother of the count should play the\r\nhostess on this occasion, but it was known that the old couple were at\r\nvariance with their only son; and the more lavish he grew in his\r\nexpenditure, the more penurious became his parents. The avarice of the\r\nlatter was as well known as the extravagance of the former, and whenever\r\nthere was a new anecdote current, illustrative of the prodigality of the\r\nson, another was related to exemplify the increasing parsimony of the\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nIt was no wonder, therefore, that the bewitching countess should have\r\nbeen selected to preside over the ball given by her aristocratic friend.\r\nEverybody was delighted. The emperor was to be there, and it was to be\r\nthe most magnificent entertainment of the season. Long before the hour\r\nfixed for the arrival of the guests, the street before the count's\r\npalace was thronged with people, eager to obtain a glance at any thing\r\nappertaining to the fairy spectacle. While they were peering through the\r\nilluminated windows at a wilderness of flowers, mirrors, silk, and\r\nvelvet, a carriage drawn by four splendid horses came thundering down\r\nthe street, and drew up before the door of the palace. Two footmen in\r\nsky-blue velvet picked out with silver, leaped down to open the door,\r\nand in a trice the large portals of the palace were thrown open, and a\r\nrich carpet rolled to the carriage door, while six liveried servants\r\nranged themselves on either side.\r\n\r\nAnd now from the carriage emerged the lady patroness, resplendent in\r\nsilver gauze, and diamonds that glittered like a constellation just\r\nfallen from the heavens. The people enraptured by the beauty of the\r\ncountess, gave vent to their admiration without stint. As she reached\r\nthe top of the marble steps, she turned and smiled upon her worshippers,\r\nwhereupon they shouted as an audience is apt do at the appearance of a\r\nfavorite prima donna.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this applause, the lady entered the hotel, and until the\r\ndoor closed and shut out the enchanted scene within, the crowd watched\r\nher graceful form as it glided along followed by a train of lackeys.\r\nCount Podstadsky came forward to meet her with ceremonious courtesy.\r\nThey entered the gay saloons, but, as if led by one common impulse, both\r\ntraversed the long suite of apartments in silence, and approached a door\r\nwhich led into a small boudoir evidently not lit up for the occasion.\r\nOnce within, the door was closed, and the purple velvet portiere was\r\ndropped before it.\r\n\r\n\"Do not be afraid,\" said the countess, with a bewitching smile, \"we are\r\nalone. You are at liberty to congratulate me upon my appearance, for I\r\nsee by your eyes that you are dying to tell me how beautiful I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither eyes nor tongue could give expression to a hundredth part of\r\nthe rapture which my heart feels at your approach, Arabella,\" replied\r\nPodstadsky, gazing upon her with passionate admiration. \"Surely every\r\nwoman must hate you, and every man be intoxicated by your charms.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are intoxicated, Carlo,\" replied she. \"They are such fools! To\r\nthink that they are willing to commit any deed of folly for the sake of\r\na fair face and two bright eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, my angel, are cruel to all, and for me alone has the proud\r\nCountess Baillou a heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"A heart!\" ejaculated the countess, with irony. \"Do you believe in\r\nhearts, silly Carlo? My dear friend, I at least am without such an\r\ninconvenience. If I love any thing it is gold. Its chink to my ear is\r\nsweetest harmony, its touch thrills through my whole being.\"\r\n\r\n\"How you have changed, Arabella! The time was when your lips murmured\r\nwords of love and despair, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, Carlo! But the woman who murmured of love and despair--she who\r\nbelieved in innocence and loyalty, is buried in the Tiber. She whom you\r\nrescued thence has received the baptism of shame; and you, Count\r\nPodstadsky, were her sponsor. You taught me the art of lying and\r\ndeceiving, and now you prate to me of a heart!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is because your maddening beauty will not suffer me to forget that\r\nmine is still susceptible of love,\" replied Podstadsky.\r\n\r\nThe countess laughed, but there was no mirth in her voice. \"Podstadsky,\"\r\nsaid she, throwing back her superb head, \"you have about as much heart\r\nas a hare, who runs from a rustling leaf, taking it to be the clink of\r\nthe hunter's rifle.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet, Arabella,\" replied Podstadsky, with a sickly smile, \"I am\r\nhere, although sometimes I do start, and fancy that I hear the hunter's\r\nstep behind me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hare-like fright,\" said Arabella, raising her shoulders. \"I wonder at\r\nyou, Carlo, when you look upon what we are, and reflect upon what we\r\nhave been. Everybody in Vienna admires and envies us. The highest nobles\r\nof the land are our willing guests, and the emperor himself (dit-on) has\r\nfallen in love with the Countess Baillou. Oh, Carlo! Is it not enough to\r\nmake all the gods of Olympus laugh?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" replied Podstadsky, encouraged. \"The emperor's visit\r\nhere to-night will silence the clamor of my creditors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Creditors! What of them? Was there ever a nobleman without creditors!\r\nThey are one of the appendages of rank. And, then, Carlo--if your\r\ncreditors annoy you, what prevents you from paying them?\"\r\n\r\nPodstadsky shuddered. \"Do you mean--\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter with the man?\" asked Arabella, as he paused, and she\r\nsaw how ghastly he looked. \"Of course, I mean you to pay as you have\r\npaid before. Pay, and pay promptly. Then when every thing--furniture,\r\nplate, jewels, horses, and equipages are ours, we sell out, and realize\r\nour fortune in GOLD--(no bank-notes, Carlo)--and, then, we take up our\r\nabode in the city of cities--Paris! Gold--gold! There is--\"\r\n\r\nA light knock was heard at the door. The countess disappeared, and the\r\ncount put out his head. It was his steward, who announced that a lady,\r\nclosely veiled, wished to speak with Count Podstadsky on urgent business.\r\n\r\n\"Show her into the anteroom. The Countess Baillou will do me the favor\r\nto receive her.\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" said the steward, \"the lady wishes to see you alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed? Then show her in here.\"\r\n\r\nThe steward retired, and the count stepped into one of the lighted\r\nrooms. The countess came forward, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"I heard it all,\" said she playfully, threatening him with her finger.\r\n\"I am not going to allow you to have a tete-a-tete in the dark. No, no,\r\nmy Jupiter, your mysterious beauty shall be received just here under the\r\nlight of the chandelier, and I shall watch you both from the boudoir.\r\nThat will be safer for all parties. I suspect a certain dark-eyed beauty\r\nof this stratagem, and I long to see the haughty prude.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you suspect Rachel Eskeles?\"\r\n\r\nArabella nodded affirmatively. \"Doubtless she comes to implore\r\nforgiveness for her father's insolence, and to deny all complicity with\r\nthe old Jewish dragon. Here she comes, Carlo, but mark me! if I see\r\ndanger ahead, I come to the rescue.\"\r\n\r\nThe countess, like a graceful gazelle, then bounded into the boudoir,\r\nwhile the count advanced to meet the veiled visitor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CL.\r\n\r\nMOTHER AND SON.\r\n\r\nWith the bow and smile of a veritable libertine, Count Podstadsky\r\noffered his arm to the lady, whose face was completely hidden by a long\r\nblack veil. The accommodating steward retired in haste, and the lady,\r\nlooking around with anxiety, murmured, \"Are we alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Entirely alone, my charming sphinx,\" replied Podstadsky. \"The god of\r\nlove alone shall hear the secrets which are to fall from your coral\r\nlips. But, first, let me remove this envious veil, my mysterious\r\ncharmer.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady stood perfectly still, while Podatadsky, by way of exordium,\r\nembraced her affectionately. Neither did she offer any opposition to his\r\ndaring hands, as first they removed her long mantilla, and then threw\r\nback her black crape veil which had so faithfully concealed her\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw her face, he started back with a cry of remorse.\r\n\r\n\"My mother, oh, my mother!\" exclaimed he, covering his face with his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nBehind the portiere there was the faint sound of a mocking laugh, but\r\nneither mother nor son heard it. They heard naught but the insufferable\r\nthrobs of their own hearts; they saw, each one, naught but the\r\ndeath-like face of the other.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is your unhappy mother--she who once vowed never again to cross\r\nyour threshold--but maternity is merciful, Carl, and I come hither to\r\npardon and to rescue you, while yet there is time for flight.\"\r\n\r\nThe young count made no reply. At the astounding revelation made by the\r\ndropping of that black veil, he had retreated in mingled shame and\r\nsurprise. He had accosted his own mother in the language of libertinism,\r\nand he stood gazing upon her with looks of sorrow and regret. He had\r\nscarcely heard her speak, so absorbed was he in self-reproach. And now\r\nas she ceased, he murmured:\r\n\r\n\"Is that my mother? My mother, with the wrinkled brow and the white\r\nhair!\"\r\n\r\nThe countess returned his gaze with a mournful smile. \"You have not seen\r\nme for two years, Carl, and since then sorrow has transformed me into an\r\nold woman. I need not tell you why I have sorrowed. Oh, my child! Whence\r\ncomes the gold with which this fearful splendor is purchased? Your\r\nfather--\"\r\n\r\n\"My father!\" echoed the count, recalled to self-possession by the word.\r\n\"What am I to him, who cursed me and forbade me his house! Tell him,\"\r\ncried he, fiercely, \"that if I am lost, it is he who shall answer to\r\nHeaven for my soul!\"\r\n\r\n\"Peace!\" exclaimed the mother, in a tone of authority. \"Nor attempt to\r\nshift your disgrace upon him who has been, not the cause of your crimes,\r\nbut their victim. Why did he curse you, reprobate, tell me why?\"\r\n\r\nThe count was so awed by her words and looks that he obeyed almost\r\ninstinctively.\r\n\r\n\"Because I had forged,\" was the whispered reply.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--forged your father's name for a million, and forced him, for the\r\nhonor of his house, to sell all that he possessed. We are so poor that\r\nwe have scarcely the necessaries of life; nevertheless, we have borne in\r\nsilence the contumely of the world that scorns us as misers. And now,\r\nalthough you have nothing to inherit, we hear of your wealth, the\r\nmagnificence of your house, of your unbounded expenditure!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mother,\" replied the count, beginning to recover from his shock,\r\n\"it is plain that I have discovered a treasure--somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you will have to explain the nature of your discovery, for your\r\nfather is about to reveal the state of his affairs to the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he does that, I am lost!\" cried Podstadsky, in tones of despair.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" gasped the unhappy mother. \"Then we were right in fearing that\r\nyour wealth was ill-gotten. Oh, Carl, Carl! look into the face of the\r\nmother who bore you, and has loved you beyond all things earthly--look\r\ninto her face, and say whence comes this magnificence.\"\r\n\r\nThe count tried to raise his eyes, but he could not meet his mother's\r\nglance. Alas! he remembered how often in childhood, after some trifling\r\nmisconduct, he had looked into those loving eyes, and read forgiveness\r\nthere!\r\n\r\nThe mother trembled, and could scarcely support her limbs. She caught at\r\na chair, and leaned upon it for a moment. Then, with faltering steps she\r\napproached her son, and raised his head with her own hands. It was a\r\ntouching scene, and Count Podstadsky himself was not unmoved by its\r\nsilent eloquence. His heart beat audibly, and his eyes filled with\r\nrepentant tears.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, my child, tell me whence comes your wealth? I will not betray\r\nyou, for I am your unhappy mother!\"\r\n\r\n\"You can do nothing for me, mother,\" sobbed the count. \"I am lost beyond\r\npower of redemption.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! alas! Then, you are guilty! But, Carl, I will not ask you any\r\nquestions--only let me save you from public disgrace. Your father is\r\ninexorable, but I can save you, my beloved child. I will leave\r\nhome--country--name--every thing for your sake; even the husband of my\r\nlife-long love. Come, my son, let us go together where no one shall ever\r\nhear your story, and where, with the grace of God, you may repent of\r\nyour sins and amend.\"\r\n\r\nThe strength of her love lent such eloquence to the words of the\r\ncountess that her son was borne away by the force of her pleadings.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my mother! if I could--if I could--\" but here his voice faltered,\r\nand the tears, which he had been striving to keep back, gushed out in\r\ntorrents. He covered his face with his hands, and sobbed aloud.\r\n\r\nHis mother smiled and made a silent thanksgiving to Heaven. \"God will\r\naccept your tears, my dear prodigal child. Come, ere it be too late.\r\nSee, I have gold. My family diamonds have yielded enough to maintain us\r\nin Switzerland. There, among its solitudes--\"\r\n\r\nA clear, musical laugh was heard, and the melodious voice of a woman\r\nspoke these scornful words:\r\n\r\n\"Count Podstadsky a peasant! a Swiss peasant! Ha! ha!\"\r\n\r\nThe old countess turned, and saw, coming from the boudoir, a vision of\r\nsuch beauty as dazzled her eyes. The vision came forward, smiling, and,\r\nPodstadsky dashing away his tears, passed in one instant from the\r\nheights of saving repentance to the unfathomable depths of hopeless\r\nobduracy.\r\n\r\nThe two women, meanwhile, faced each other: the one laughing,\r\ntriumphant, beautiful, alas, as Circe; the other pale, sorrowful a, the\r\nguardian angel of the soul which has just been banished from the\r\npresence of God forever!\r\n\r\n\"Pray, Carlo, introduce me to your mother,\" said Arabella. \"You are not\r\nyet a Swiss peasant. Pending your metamorphosis, be a little more\r\nobservant of the conventions and courtesies of high life!\"\r\n\r\n\"She has been eaves-dropping,\" exclaimed the Countess Podstadsky,\r\ncontemptuously.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Arabella, with perfect equanimity. \"I have enjoyed the\r\nprivilege of witnessing this charming scene. You, madame, have acted\r\nincomparably, but your son has not sustained you. The role you have\r\ngiven him is inappropriate. To ask of him to play the repentant sinner,\r\nis simply ridiculous. Count Podstadsky is a gentleman, and has no taste\r\nfor idyls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is this woman?\" asked the old countess.\r\n\r\nHer son had regained all his self-possession again. He approached\r\nArabella, and, taking her hand, led her directly up to his mother.\r\n\r\n\"My mother, I beg to present to you the Countess Baillou, the\r\nlady-patroness of the ball I give to-night.\"\r\n\r\nThe old countess paid no attention to Arabella's deep courtesy. She was\r\ntoo much in earnest to heed her.\r\n\r\n\"Will you come, Carl? Every moment is precious.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear lady,\" exclaimed Arabella, \"you forget that not only the\r\naristocracy of Vienna, but the emperor himself, is to be your son's\r\nguest to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not listen to her, my son,\" cried the wretched mother. \"Her voice is\r\nthe voice of the evil spirit that would lure you on to destruction.\r\nCarl! Carl!\" cried she, laying her vigorous grasp upon his arm, \"be not\r\nso irresolute! Come, and prove yourself to be a man!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay!\" interposed Arabella, \"be a man, Carl, and suffer no old woman to\r\ncome under your own roof and chide you as if you were her naughty boy.\r\nWhat business, pray, is it of this lady's, where you gather your riches?\r\nAnd what to the distinguished Podstadsky are the clamors of two\r\nunnatural parents, who have long since lost all claim to his respect?\"\r\n\r\n\"Carl! Carl!\" shrieked the mother, \"do not heed her. She is an evil\r\nspirit. Come with me.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Arabella raised her starry eyes, and fixed them with\r\nan expression of passionate love upon the count. That simulated look\r\nsealed his fate.\r\n\r\n\"No, mother, no. Importune me no longer, for I will not leave Vienna.\r\nEnough of this tragi-comedy--leave me in peace!\"\r\n\r\nArabella flung him a kiss from the tips of her rosy fingers.\r\n\r\n\"Spoken like a man, at last,\" said she.\r\n\r\nFor a while not a word was beard in that gorgeous room, where the\r\nchandeliers flung their full red glare upon the group below--the\r\nwhite-haired mother-the recusant son--the beautiful enchantress--whose\r\nblack art had just sundered them forever.\r\n\r\nAt length she spoke, that broken-hearted mother, and her voice was\r\nhollow as a sound from the grave.\r\n\r\n\"Thou hast chosen. God would have rescued thee, but thou hast turned\r\naway from His merciful warning! Farewell, unhappy one, farewell!\"\r\n\r\nShe wrapped her dark mantle around her, and concealed her face again in\r\nthe veil.\r\n\r\nHer son dared not offer his hand, for evil eyes were upon him, and he\r\nallowed her to depart without a word. Slowly she traversed the scene of\r\nsinful splendor, her tall, dark figure reflected from mirror to mirror\r\nas she went; and before the receding vision of that crushed and\r\ndespairing mother the lights above seemed to pale, and the gilding of\r\nthose rich saloons grew dim and spectral.\r\n\r\nFarther and farther she went, Podstadsky gazing after her, while\r\nArabella gazed upon him. She reached the last door, and he started as if\r\nto follow. His tempter drew him firmly back, and calmed his agitation\r\nwith her magic smile.\r\n\r\n\"Stay, beloved,\" said she, tenderly. \"From this hour I shall be mother,\r\nmistress, friend--all things to you!\"\r\n\r\nHe clasped her passionately to his heart, sobbing, \"I wish for nothing\r\non earth but your love, the love which will follow me even to the\r\nscaffold!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw!\" exclaimed Arabella, \"what an ugly word to whisper to these\r\nbeautiful rooms! Look here, Carl, the diamonds we own in common are\r\nworth half a million. We must do a good business to-night. When the\r\nemperor has retired, the hostess will have a right to preside over the\r\nfaro table, and you know that my cards never betray me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it, my enchantress,\" cried Carl, kissing her. \"Let us make haste\r\nand grow rich. I would go anywhere with you, were it even to\r\nSwitzerland.\"\r\n\r\n\"But not as a peasant, Carl. First, however, we must have our millions.\r\nNow, be reasonable to-night, and don't play the Italian lover. Colonel\r\nSzekuly is desperately enamored of me, and he will be sure to sit next\r\nto me at the faro-table. The place he covets shall cost him a fortune.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment the steward entered the room.\r\n\r\n\"A message from the emperor, my lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can it be?\"\r\n\r\n\"His majesty regrets that he cannot keep his engagement this evening\r\nwith Count Podstadsky.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a disappointment. What else?\" asked the countess, as the\r\nservant still stood there.\r\n\r\n\"Several other excuses, my lady. The two Princesses Lichtenstein,\r\nCountess Thun, and Princess Esterhazy also have sent apologies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Duval. Go, for the guests will be corning.\"\r\n\r\nThe steward went, and the pair looked at each other in anxious silence.\r\nBoth were pale, both were frightened.\r\n\r\n\"What can it mean? What can it mean?\" faltered the countess.\r\n\r\n\"What can it mean?\" echoed the count, and he stared, for again he\r\nthought that he saw his mother's shadow darkening the splendor of those\r\nprincely halls, whose lights were flickering as though they were about\r\nto be extinguished and leave the guilty accomplices in irretrievable\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n\"Arabella, something threatens us!\" whispered Podstadsky.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! Our guests are arriving.\" said she, rallying \"Cour age, Carl,\r\ncourage! A smooth brow and bright smile for the aristocratic world,\r\nCount Podstadsky!\"\r\n\r\nThe doors opened, and crowds of splendid women, accompanied by their\r\ncavaliers, floated in toward the lady patroness, who received them all\r\nwith bewitching grace, and won all hearts by her affability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLI.\r\n\r\nTHE TWO OATHS.\r\n\r\n\"Already, beloved? Think that for three long weeks I have not seen you,\r\nGunther! It is so early: no one misses me in the house, for my father\r\nreturns from his bank at nine only. Who knows when we shall meet again?\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow, my Rachel, if you will permit me to return, and every\r\nmorning at this hour, I shall be here behind the grove, waiting for my\r\nangel to unlock the gates of Paradise, and admit me to the heaven of her\r\npresence.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will surely come! Nor storm nor rain shall deter me. Here, in this\r\npavilion, we are secure from curious eyes. God alone, who blesses our\r\nlove, shall see into our hearts!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Rachel, how I honor and love your energetic soul! When I am with\r\nyou, I fear nothing. But away from the influence of those angelic eyes,\r\nI tremble and grow faint.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you fear, Gunther?\"\r\n\r\n\"The pride of riches, Rachel. Your father would laugh me to scorn were\r\nhe to hear that his peerless daughter is loved by a man without rank or\r\nfortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"But whose heart has a patent of nobility from God!\" exclaimed Rachel,\r\nwith enthusiasm. \"And besides, Gunther, are you not a confidential\r\nfriend of the emperor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Gunther, bitterly. \"The emperor calls me 'friend,' and in\r\n'grateful acknowledgment of my services,' he has raised my salary to\r\nthree thousand florins. But what is that to your father, who pays twice\r\nthe amount to his book-keeper! Why are you the daughter of a man whose\r\nwealth reflects discredit upon my love!\"\r\n\r\n\"No one who looks into your noble face will suspect the purity of your\r\nlove, dear Gunther. But, alas, my lover! there is an obstacle greater\r\nthan wealth, to part us--the obstacle of your cruel faith, which does\r\nnot permit the Christian to wed with the Jew.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you were poor, my Rachel, I would try to win you over from the\r\nJewish God of vengeance to the merciful God of the Christian. Would I\r\ncould bring such an offering to Jesus as that of your pure young heart!\"\r\n\r\n\"My father would die were I to renounce my faith,\" said Rachel, suddenly\r\ngrowing sad. \"But before he died, he would curse me.\"\r\n\r\n\"How calmly you speak, and yet your words are the death-warrant of my\r\nhopes!\" exclaimed Gunther, despairingly.\r\n\r\n\"I speak calmly, because I have long since resolved never to be the wife\r\nof another man,\" replied Rachel. \"If I must choose between father and\r\nlover, I follow you. If my father drives me from his home, then,\r\nGunther, I will come and seek shelter upon your faithful heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you shall find it there, my own one!--I dare not call you, beloved,\r\nbut oh! I await with longing the hour of your coming--the hour when, of\r\nyour own free will, your little hand shall be laid in mine, to journey\r\nwith me from earth to heaven! Adieu, sweetest. I go, but my soul remains\r\nbehind.\"\r\n\r\n\"And mine goes with you,\" replied Rachel. He clasped her in his arms and\r\nover and over again imprinted his passionate kisses upon her willing\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow,\" whispered she. \"Here is the key of the gate. I shall be in\r\nthe pavilion.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he turned to kiss her, and so they parted. Rachel watched his\r\ntall, graceful figure until it was hidden by the trees, then she clasped\r\nher hands in prayer:\r\n\r\n\"O God, bless and protect our love! Shelter us from evil, but if it must\r\ncome, grant me strength to bear it!\"\r\n\r\nSlowly and thoughtfully she returned to the house. Her heart was so\r\nfilled with thoughts of her lover, that she did not see the stirring of\r\nthe blind, through which her father's dark, angry eyes had witnessed\r\ntheir meeting. It was not until she had entered her room that she\r\nawakened from her dream of bliss. Its splendor recalled her senses, and\r\nwith a sob she exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Why am I not a beggar, or a poor Christian child? Any thing--any thing\r\nthat would make me free to be his wife!--\"\r\n\r\nShe ceased, for she heard her father's voice. Yes, it was indeed he! How\r\ncame he to be at home so soon? His hand was upon the door, and now he\r\nspoke to her.\r\n\r\n\"Are you up, my daughter? Can I come in?\"\r\n\r\nRachel hastened to open the door, and her father entered the room with a\r\nbright smile.\r\n\r\n\"So soon dressed, Rachel! I was afraid that I might have disturbed your\r\nslumbers,\" said he, drawing her to him, and kissing her. \"Not only\r\ndressed, but dressed so charmingly, that one would suppose the sun were\r\nyour lover, and had already visited you here. Or, perhaps you expect\r\nsome of your adoring counts this morning--hey!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, father, I expect no one.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the better, for I have glorious news for you. Do you remember\r\nwhat I promised when you consented to let me punish Count Podstadsky\r\nafter my own fashion?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, dear father, I do not remember ever to have been bribed to obey\r\nyour commands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, I will tell you my news, my glorious news. I have become a\r\nfreiherr.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were always a free man, my father; your millions have long ago made\r\nyou a freiherr.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravely spoken, my Jewess,\" cried Eskeles Flies. \"I will reward you by\r\ntelling you what I have bought for you. A carriage-load of illuminated\r\nmanuscripts decorated with exquisite miniatures, that you may enrich\r\nyour library with Christian Bibles and papal bulls of every size and\r\nform.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear father, how I thank you for these treasures!\"\r\n\r\n\"Treasures, indeed! They are part of the library of a convent. The\r\nemperor has destroyed them as the Vandals once did the treasures of the\r\nGoths. I bought them from one of our own people. And that is not all. I\r\nhave a communion-service and an ostensorium for you, whose sculptures\r\nare worthy of Benvenuto Cellini. I purchased these also from a Jew, who\r\nbought them at one of the great church auctions. Ha, ha! He was going to\r\nmelt them up--the vessels that Christian priests had blessed and held\r\nsacred!\"\r\n\r\n\"That was no disgrace for him, father; but it is far different with the\r\nemperor, who has desecrated the things which are esteemed holy in his\r\nown curch. The emperor is not likely to win the affections of his people\r\nby acts like these.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw! He wanted gold, and cared very little whence it came,\" cried\r\nEskeles Flies, with a contemptuous shrug. \"His munificent mother having\r\nemptied the imperial treasury, the prudent son had to replenish it.\r\nTrue, his method of creating a fund is not the discreetest he could have\r\nchosen; for while teaching his people new modes of financiering, he has\r\nforgotten that he is also teaching them to pilfer their own gods. What\r\nan outcry would be raised in Christendom, if the Jew should plunder his\r\nown synagogue. But I tell you, Rachel, that when the lust of riches\r\ntakes possession of a Christian's heart, it maddens his brain. Not so\r\nwith the Jew. Were he starving, he would never sell the holy of holies.\r\nBut the Jew never starves--not he! He lays ducat upon ducat until the\r\nglistening heap dazzles the Christian's eyes, and he comes to barter his\r\nwares for it. So is it with me. My gold has bought for me the\r\nmerchandise of nobility.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you really in earnest, father? Have you thought it necessary to add\r\nto the dignity of your Jewish birthright the bawble of a baron's title?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not, Rachel? The honor is salable, and it gives one consideration\r\nwith the Christian. I have bought the title, and the escutcheon, as I\r\nbuy a set of jewels for my daughter. Both are intended to dazzle our\r\nenemies, and to excite their envy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how came it to pass?\" asked Rachel. \"How came you to venture such\r\nan unheard-of demand? A Jewish baron is an anomaly which the world has\r\nnever seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"For that very reason I demanded it. I had rendered extraordinary\r\nservices to the emperor. He sent for me to repay me the millions I had\r\nlent him without interest; and I took occasion there to speak of my\r\nthriving manufactures and my great commercial schemes. 'Ah,' said he,\r\nputting his hand affectionately upon my shoulder (for the emperor loves\r\na rich man), 'ah, if I had many such merchant-princes as you, the Black\r\nSea would soon be covered with Austrian ships.' Then he asked what he\r\ncould do in return for the favor I had done him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you asked for a baron's title!\"\r\n\r\n\"I did. The emperor opened his large eyes, and looked knowingly at me.\r\nHe had guessed my thoughts. 'So,' said he, 'you would like to provoke\r\nthe aristocracy to little, would you? Well--I rather like the idea.\r\nThey are in need of a lesson to bring down their rebellious spirit, and\r\nI shall give it to them. You are a more useful man to me than any of\r\nthem, and you shall be created a baron. I shall also elevate several\r\nother distinguished Jews to the rank of nobles, and the aristocracy\r\nshall understand that wherever I find merit I reward it.'\"\r\n\r\n\"So then it was your worth, and not your gold, that earned for you the\r\ndistinction!\" cried Rachel, gratified.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! 'Merit' means wealth, and I assure you that titles cost\r\nenormous sums. I must pay for my patent ten thousand florins, and if I\r\nshould wish to be a count, I must pay twenty thousand. But enough of all\r\nthis. Suffice it that I shall prove to the nobles that my money is as\r\ngood as their genealogical trees, and now we shall have crowds of noble\r\nadorers at the Baroness Rachel's feet. But be she baroness or countess,\r\nshe is forever a Jewess, and that parts her eternally from any but a\r\nwooer of her own faith. Does it not, my Rachel, my loyal Israelitish\r\nbaroness?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you doubt me, my father?\" asked Rachel in a faltering voice, while\r\nshe averted her face.\r\n\r\n\"No, my child, for if I did, I would curse you on the spot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear, dear father, do not speak such fearful words!\" cried Rachel,\r\ntrembling with fright.\r\n\r\n\"You are right, child. I am childish to indulge the supposition of my\r\nHebrew maiden's treachery. She is pure before the Lord, loyal and true\r\nto the faith of her fathers. But we must be armed against temptation,\r\nand before we part for the day, we must both swear eternal fidelity to\r\nour creed. These wily Christians may come with flattery and smiles, and\r\nsome one of them might steal my Rachel's heart. I swear, therefore, by\r\nall that is sacred on earth or in heaven, never to abandon the Jewish\r\nfaith, and never to enter a Christian church. So help me God!\"\r\n\r\nRachel gazed upon her father with blanched cheeks and distended eyes;\r\nher muscles stiffened with horror, until she seemed to be turning to\r\nstone.\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear my oath, Rachel?\" said he.\r\n\r\nShe parted her lips, and they faltered an inaudible \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said he, gently, \"repeat the oath, for we both must take it.\"\r\n\r\nShe raised her head with a quick, convulsive motion, and stammered,\r\n\"What--what is it, father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Swear, as I have done, never to leave the faith of your fathers, never\r\nto enter a Christian church.\"\r\n\r\nRachel made no reply. She stared again as though her senses were\r\nforsaking her. She thought she would go mad. Her father's brow\r\ncontracted, and his mien grew fierce as he saw that his daughter's heart\r\nhad gone irrevocably from him. There was a long, dreadful pause.\r\n\r\n\"Are you at a loss for words?\" asked the baron, and his voice was so\r\nsavage that Rachel started at the ominous sound.\r\n\r\n\"Repeat my words, then,\" continued he, seeing that she made no answer,\r\n\"or I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Say, on, my father,\" replied the despairing girl.\r\n\r\nBaron Eskeles Flies repeated his oath, and the pale victim spoke the\r\nwords after him. But at the end of the ordeal she reeled and fell to the\r\nfloor. Her father bent over, and raising her tenderly, folded her to his\r\nheart. His voice was now as loving as ever.\r\n\r\n\"My precious child, we are truly united now. Nothing can part us, and\r\nyour happy father will surround you with such splendor as you have never\r\nbeheld before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my father!\" exclaimed she, \"what has splendor to do with\r\nhappiness?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything,\" replied her father, with a careless laugh. \"Misfortune is\r\nnot near so ugly in a palace as in a cottage; and I do assure you that\r\nthe tears which are shed in a softly-cushioned carriage are not half so\r\nbitter as those that fall from the eyes of the houseless beggar. Wealth\r\ntakes the edge from affliction, and lends new lustre to happiness. And\r\nit shall shed its brightest halo over yours, my daughter. But I must\r\nleave you, for I expect to earn a fortune before I return, when I hope\r\nto see you bright and beautiful as ever.\"\r\n\r\nHe kissed her forehead and stroked her silky hair. \"The Baroness Rachel\r\nwill be a Jewess forever! Oh, how can I thank you for that promise, my\r\nadored child! What new pleasure can I procure for my idol to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Love me, father,\" murmured Rachel.\r\n\r\n\"What need you ask for love, you who are to me like the breath of life?\r\nTo show how I anticipate your wishes, I have already prepared a\r\ngratification for you. I have remarked how much pleasure you take in the\r\ngardens and little pavilion yonder. Since my Rachel loves to take her\r\nmorning walk there, it shall be changed into a paradise. The brightest\r\nfruits and flowers of the tropics shall bloom in its conservatories: and\r\ninstead of the little pavilion, I shall raise up a temple of purest\r\nwhite marble, worthy of the nymph who haunts the spot. For a few weeks\r\nyour walks will be somewhat disturbed, darling, for the workmen will\r\nbegin to-morrow; but they aced not be much in your way, for while the\r\nwalls are down, I shall set a watch at every gate to make sure that no\r\none intrudes upon your privacy. In a few months you shall have a\r\nminiature palace wherein to rest, when you are tired of roaming about\r\nthe grounds: Farewell, my child. I shall send the workmen\r\nto-morrow--early to-morrow morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"He knows all,\" thought poor Rachel, as he closed the door. \"The oath\r\nwas to part me from Gunther; the changes in the garden are to prevent us\r\nfrom meeting.\"\r\n\r\nFor a long time she sat absorbed in grief. But finally she made her\r\nresolve.\r\n\r\n\"I have sworn to love thee forever, my Gunther,\" said she. \"When the\r\nhour comes wherein my choice must be made, I go with thee!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLII.\r\n\r\nNEW-FASHIONED OBSEQUIES.\r\n\r\nThe emperor's horse was saddled, and he was about to take his daily\r\nride. But as he was leaving his cabinet, a page announced Field-Marshal\r\nLacy.\r\n\r\n\"Admit him,\" said Joseph, and he hastened to the anteroom to greet his\r\nfavorite.\r\n\r\nLacy received the cordial greeting of the emperor with a grave, troubled\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" said he, \"may I beg for an audience?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, my friend,\" replied Joseph. \"I am just about to ride, and\r\nyou can accompany me. We can converse together in some of the shady\r\nalleys of the park. I will order a horse for you at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, sire, our interview must be here. I saw your majesty's horse\r\nin readiness for your ride, but that did not prevent me from coming, for\r\nthe matter which brought me hither is one of supreme importance.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you cannot put it off until we take our ride?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, my first request is that your majesty will relinquish the ride\r\naltogether. You must not be seen in the streets to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless me, Lacy! you speak as if I were Louis of France, who is afraid\r\nto show himself in public, because of the murmurs of his discontented\r\nsubjects.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, assume that you are Louis, then, and give up the ride. Do it, if\r\nyou love me, my sovereign.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I love you!\" repeated Joseph, with surprise. \"Well, then, it shall\r\nbe done.\" And he rang, and ordered his horse to be put up. \"Now speak.\r\nWhat can have happened here, that I should be threatened with a\r\ndiscontented mob?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" began Lacy, \"you remember the day on which we swore to speak the\r\ntruth to your majesty, even if it should become importunate, do you\r\nnot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do, Lacy; but neither of you have kept the promise up to this\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am here to redeem my word, sire. I come to warn your majesty that you\r\nare proceeding too rashly with your measures of reform.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you also, Lacy!\" cried Joseph, reproachfully. \"You, the bravest of\r\nthe brave, would have me retreat before the dissatisfaction of priests\r\nand bigots.\"\r\n\r\n\"The malcontents are not only priests and bigots, they are your whole\r\npeople. You attempt too many reforms at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"But my reforms are all for the people's good. I am no tyrant to oppress\r\nand trample them under foot. I am doing my best to free them from the\r\nshackles of prejudice, and yet they harass and oppose me. Even those who\r\nunderstand my aims, place obstacles in my path. Oh, Lacy, it wounds me\r\nto see that not even my best friends sustain me!\"\r\n\r\n\"I see that your majesty is displeased,\" replied Lacy, sadly, \"and that\r\nyou reckon me among your opponents--I who am struck with admiration at\r\nthe grandeur of your conceptions. But you are so filled with the\r\nrectitude of your intentions, that you have no indulgence for the\r\nweakness and ignorance of those whom you would benefit, and you snake\r\ntoo light of the enmity of those whom your reforms have aggrieved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whom have I aggrieved?\" cried Joseph, impatiently. \"Priests and nobles,\r\nnobody besides. If I have displeased them, it is because I wish to put\r\nall men on an equality. The privileged classes may hate me--let them do\r\nit, but the people whom I befriend will love and honor me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, sire, you think too well of the people,\" said Lacy. \"And mindful of\r\nmy promise, I must say that you have given cause for dissatisfaction to\r\nall classes, plebeian as well as patrician.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\" cried Joseph.\r\n\r\n\"You have despised their prejudices, and mocked at customs which in\r\ntheir superstitious ignorance they hold as sacred. They do not thank you\r\nfor enlightening them. They call you an unbeliever and an apostate. Do\r\nnot be displeased, sire, if I speak so plainly of things which the\r\nstupidity of your subjects regards as a crime. I come as your majesty's\r\naccuser, because I come as the advocate of your people, imploring you to\r\nbe patient with their blindness and their folly.\"\r\n\r\n\"What now? Is there any special complaint against me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire. Your majesty has issued an edict which has wounded the\r\npeople in those relations which the world holds sacred; an edict which\r\nis (forgive me if I speak plain)--which is--so entirely free from\r\nprejudice, that it trenches almost--upon the limits of barbarism.\"\r\n\r\n\"What edict can you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"That which concerns the burial of the dead, sire. I beseech you, revoke\r\nit; for the people cry out that nothing is sacred to the emperor--not\r\neven death and the grave! Leave them their cemeteries and their tombs,\r\nthat they may go thither and pray for the souls of the departed!\"\r\n\r\n\"That they may go thither and enjoy their superstitious rites!\" cried\r\nJoseph, indignantly. \"I will not allow my subjects to seek for their\r\ndead underground. They shall not solemnize the corruption of the body;\r\nthey shall turn their eyes to Heaven, and there seek for the immortal\r\nspirit of the departed! They shall not love the dust of their\r\nforefathers, but their souls!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, you speak of an ideal people. To bring mankind to such a state of\r\nperfection would require the reign of a Methusaleh! It is too soon for\r\nsuch edicts. The people, so far from appreciating, abhor them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you really in earnest, Lacy?\" exclaimed the emperor, with flashing\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire, they are indignant. Yesterday the first burial, according to\r\nyour majesty's edict, took place, and since then the people are in a\r\nstate of revolt. To-day there are of course other bodies to be interred.\r\nThere is not a vagrant in the streets that does not utter threats\r\nagainst your majesty. From the burgher to the beggar, every man feels\r\nthat his sacred rights have been invaded. They feel that the prohibition\r\nof coffins and burying-grounds does not reach the rich, who have their\r\nhereditary tombs in churches and chapels, but the people, who have no\r\nsuch privileges.\"\r\n\r\n\"The people for whose sakes I would have converted the mould of the\r\nburying-ground into fertile fields, and spared them the cost of a\r\nuseless coffin, which, instead of rotting in the ground, would have been\r\nso much more wood to warm them in winter, and cook the food for their\r\nhungry, living bodies!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, your majesty, they are not sufficiently enlightened to comprehend\r\nyour ideas. Revoke the order, sire--in mercy to their ignorance, revoke\r\nthe order!\"\r\n\r\n\"Revoke it!\" cried Joseph, furiously. \"Never will I make such a\r\nconcession to stupidity and malice!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Lacy, gravely, \"it is possible that the flames of a\r\nrevolution may burst forth to consume this unhappy land. Oh, sire, have\r\nmercy upon the poor people, whose eyes cannot endure the light of\r\nreform! Preserve yourself and your subjects from the horrors of a\r\nrevolt, which, although it would be ultimately quelled, might cost\r\nbloodshed and misery! I have never seen such excitement as prevails\r\nthroughout the streets of Vienna. Thousands of men and women throng the\r\nquarter where the body lies.\"\r\n\r\n\"When does the funeral take place?\"\r\n\r\n\"At three o'clock this afternoon, sire.\"\r\n\r\n\"In one hour, then,\" said the emperor, glancing at the clock.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire; and it may be an hour of tribulation, unless your majesty\r\nhas the magnanimity to prevent it! To discourage idle assemblages, your\r\nmajesty has forbidden the people to follow funerals. The effect of this\r\nprohibition is, that the poor woman who is to be buried this afternoon\r\nwill be followed, not by her friends, but by thousands who have never\r\nseen or known her. The police have done their best to disperse the\r\nrioters, but so far in vain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then there is already a revolt,\" cried the emperor.\r\n\r\n\"But for this I never should have presumed to deter your majesty from\r\nenjoying your ride to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose that I would retreat before my own subjects?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, the wrath of the populace is like that of a tiger just escaped\r\nfrom its cage. In its bloodthirstiness it tears to pieces every thing\r\nthat comes in its way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am curious to witness its antics,\" replied the emperor, touching the\r\nbell.\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" exclaimed Lacy, staying Joseph's hand, \"what would you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mount my horse, and go to the funeral.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! To exasperate the crowd! To endanger yourself, and drive these\r\npoor, half-frantic creatures to desperation! Oh, by the love you bear us\r\nall, I beseech you, have mercy upon those whose only possession on earth\r\nis oftentimes the grave! You would deprive their children of the only\r\ncomfort left them--that of praying over the ashes of the departed. You\r\nwould deprive those who are condemned to live like brutes, of the\r\ncomfort of dying like men. You would have their bodies sewed in sacks\r\nand thrown into ditches where they are not even allowed to moulder, but\r\nmust be destroyed by lime. No tombstone permitted over their remains,\r\nnothing to remind their weeping relatives that they were ever alive! Oh,\r\nthis is cruel! It may be a great thought, sire, but it is a barbarous\r\ndeed! I know how bold I am, but my conscience compels me to speak; and\r\nwere I to lose the emperor's favor, I must obey its faithful monitions.\r\nRevoke the edict, sire! There is yet time. In one hour it will be too\r\nlate!\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor looked despondently at Lacy's agitated countenance. Then,\r\nwithout a word, he turned to his escritoire and hastily began to write.\r\nHis writing concluded, he handed the paper to Lacy, and commanded him to\r\nread it aloud. Lacy bowed and read as follows:\r\n\r\n\"As I have learned that the living are so material in their ideas as to\r\nset great store upon the privilege of having their bodies rot and become\r\ncarrion after death, I shall concern myself in no way as to the the\r\nmanner of their burying. Let it be known, therefore, that having shown\r\nthe wisdom of disposing of the dead after the manner described in my\r\nedict, I shall force no man to be wise. Those who are not convinced of\r\nits expediency, are free to dispose of their carcasses as they see fit.\"\r\n[Footnote: Hubner, \"Life of Joseph II.,\" vol. ii., p. 525.]\r\n\r\nWhen Lacy had read to the end, the emperor called imperatively for\r\nGunther. He obeyed the summons at once.\r\n\r\n\"This letter to the lord high chancellor, Prince Kaunitz,\" said he, \"I\r\nwish this writing to be printed and posted at the corners of the\r\nstreets. Then hasten to the Leopold suburbs, where anyone of the police\r\nwill show you to the house whence the funeral is to take place. Go\r\nwithin, and tell the relatives of the deceased that I give them\r\npermission to bedizen their corpse in whatever style they may choose,\r\nand to bury it in a coffin. Take a carriage and drive fast.\"\r\n\r\nGunther bowed and turned to leave. \"Stop a moment,\" continued the\r\nemperor. \"Go to the chief of police, and tell him that the people must\r\nnot be disturbed in any way. They must be allowed to disperse at their\r\npleasure. Now, Gunther, be quick.\"\r\n\r\nWith a look of unspeakable affection Joseph gave his hand to Lacy.\r\n\"Lacy,\" said he, \"if I have made this great sacrifice to-day, it is\r\nneither from conviction nor fear; it is to show you what influence your\r\nwords have over me, and to thank you for the manliness with which you\r\nhave ventured to blame my acts. Few princes possess the jewel of a\r\nfaithful friend. I thank God that this jewel is mine!\" [Footnote: The\r\nburial edict was as follows: \"As the burial of the dead has for its\r\nobject the speedy dissolution of the body, and as nothing hinders that\r\ndissolution more than the casing of the corpse in a coffin, it is\r\nordained that all dead bodies shall be stripped of their clothing, and\r\nsewed up in a linen sack, laid in an open coffin, and brought to the\r\nplace of interment. A hole shall be dug six feet long and four feet\r\nwide, and the corpse being taken out of the coffin, shall be put into\r\nthis grave, strewed plentifully with quick-lime, and covered with earth.\r\nIf more than one corpse is to be buried, the bodies can all be put in\r\nthe same grave.\"--Gross-Hoffinger, \"History of the Life and Reign of\r\nJoseph II.,\" vol. ii., p. 146.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLIII.\r\n\r\nTHE POPE IN VIENNA.\r\n\r\nA report, almost incredible, was obtaining currency in Vienna. It was\r\nsaid that the pope was about to visit the emperor. Many a German\r\nemperor, in centuries gone by, had made his pilgrimage to Rome; but\r\nnever before had the vicar of Christ honored the sovereign of Austria by\r\ncoming to him.\r\n\r\nPius VI., confounded by the headlong innovations of Joseph, and\r\ntrembling lest his reforms should end in a total subversion of religion,\r\nhad resolved, in the extremity of his distress, to become a pilgrim\r\nhimself, and to visit the enemy in his own stronghold.\r\n\r\nTo this intent he had dispatched an autographic letter announcing his\r\nintention, to which the emperor had replied by another, expressive of\r\nhis extreme anxiety to become personally acquainted with his holiness,\r\nand to do him all filial reverence. Furthermore, he begged that the pope\r\nwould relinquish his intention of taking up his abode at the nuncio, and\r\nwould consent to be the guest of the imperial family.\r\n\r\nThe pope having graciously acceded to this wish, the apartments of the\r\nlate empress were prepared for his occupation. Now Joseph was quite\r\naware that these apartments abounded in secret doors and private\r\nstairways, by which Maria Theresa's many petitioners had been accustomed\r\nto find their way to the privy purse of the munificent empress, and so\r\nhad diminished the imperial treasury of several millions.\r\n\r\nThe emperor, dreading lest these secret avenues should be used by the\r\nfriends of the church to visit the pope in private, caused the stairways\r\nto be demolished, and all the doors to be walled up. He allowed but one\r\nissue from the apartments of his holiness. This one led into the grand\r\ncorridor, and was guarded by two sentries, who had orders to allow\r\nnobody to enter who was unprovided with a pass signed by Joseph himself.\r\nHe was quite willing to receive the pope as a guest; but he was resolved\r\nthat he should hold no communication with his bishops, while on Austrian\r\nsoil. [Footnote: It was to Joseph's manifest advantage that the pope\r\nshould not reside outside of the palace; and the emperor showed his\r\ningenuity in the various strategic movements by which he defeated the\r\npurpose of his visit. One of the pope's most zealous adherents was the\r\nBishop of Gortz. When the pope left Rome for Vienna, he would pass\r\nthrough Gortz. Joseph summoned the bishop to Vienna, and so prevented a\r\nmeeting between them at Gortz; and on the day of the pope's arrival in\r\nVienna, the bishop received peremptory orders to return to his diocese.\r\nHe was not allowed to communicate with the pope, not even to see him as\r\nhe passed,--Friedel's \"Letters from Vienna,\" vol. i., p. 223.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, every outward honor was to be paid to the head of the church.\r\nNot only had his rooms been superbly decorated, but the churches, also,\r\nwere in all their splendor. The vestments of the clergy had been\r\nrenewed, new altar-cloths woven, and magnificent hangings ordered for\r\nthe papal throne erected for the occasion.\r\n\r\nFinally, the momentous day dawned, and Vienna put on its holiday attire.\r\nThe houses were wreathed with garlands, the streets were hung with\r\narches of evergreen. A hundred thousand Viennese pressed toward the\r\ncathedral, where the pope was to repair for prayer, and another throng\r\nwas hastening toward the palace, where the pope and the emperor were to\r\nalight together. In their impatient curiosity the people had forsaken\r\ntheir work. No one was content to remain within doors. Everybody said to\r\neverybody, \"The pope has come to Vienna;\" and then followed the\r\nquestion:\r\n\r\n\"Why has his holiness come to Vienna?\"\r\n\r\n\"To bless the emperor, and approve his great deeds,\" said the friends of\r\nJoseph.\r\n\r\n\"To bring him, if possible, to a sense of his sacrilegious persecution\r\nof the church.\" said his enemies.\r\n\r\nThis question was not only verbally agitated, but it formed the subject\r\nof thousands of pamphlets, which fluttered from many a window toward the\r\ncrowds who, in breathless anxiety, were awaiting the advent of Pius VI.\r\n\r\n\"The Arrival of the Pope.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why has the Pope come to Vienna?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the Pope?\"\r\n\r\nThese were the titles of the brochures which were converting the streets\r\ninto a vast reading-room, and preparing the minds of the readers for the\r\nimpressions it was desirable to create on the subject.\r\n\r\nAt last the deep bells of St. Stephen's opened their brazen throats.\r\nThis signified that the pope and the emperor were at the gates of the\r\ncity. The consent of the latter having been asked in the matter of the\r\nbell-ringing, he had replied to Cardinal Megazzi: \"By all means. I\r\nwonder you should ask me the question, when bells are the artillery of\r\nthe church.\" [Footnote: Friedel's Letters, vol. i., p. 213.]\r\n\r\nThe people received the tidings with such wild joy that, in their\r\neagerness, several persons were trampled to death. But on they rushed,\r\nseeing and hearing nothing until eight lives were sacrificed to the\r\nfierce curiosity of the mob.\r\n\r\nAnd now the iron tongues of every bell in Vienna proclaimed that the\r\npope had entered the city. The crowd, who, up to this moment, had\r\nlaughed, sung, and shouted, suddenly ceased their clamor. Nothing was\r\nheard save the musical chime of the bells, while every eye was fixed\r\nupon a small white spot which was just becoming visible. The point grew\r\nlarger, and took form. First came the outriders, then the imperial\r\nequipage drawn by eight milk-white horses caparisoned with crimson and\r\ngold. Nearer and nearer came the cortege, until the people recognized\r\nthe noble old man, whose white locks flowed from under his velvet cap,\r\nthe supreme pontiff, Antonio Braschi, Pope Pius VI.\r\n\r\nNever, throughout his pontifical career, had the pope beheld such a\r\ncrowd before. And these hundreds of thousands had assembled to bid him\r\nwelcome. A smile of gratification flitted over his handsome features,\r\nand he raised his eyes to the face of his companion.\r\n\r\nThe countenance of the emperor wore a satisfied expression; by some it\r\nmight have been regarded as derisive.\r\n\r\nHe had seen what the pope, in the simple joy of his heart, had not\r\nobserved. The people who, in the presence of the high dignitaries of the\r\nchurch, had been accustomed to kneel and ask a blessing, were standing,\r\nalthough the prelate who stood in their midst was the sovereign pontiff\r\nhimself; and Joseph, as he contemplated his subjects, exulted in secret.\r\n\r\nThe cortege, impeded by the throng, moved slowly toward the imperial\r\npalace. When it drew up before the gates, Joseph, springing from the\r\ncarriage, assisted the pope to alight, and accompanied him to his\r\napartments. Occasionally Pius raised his mild eyes to the emperor's face\r\nand smiled, while Joseph, in nowise discomposed by the honor of\r\nreceiving the chief pastor of Christendom, walked proudly by his side.\r\n\r\nThey passed through the magnificent state apartments designed for the\r\noccultation of the pope; but not until they had reached his private\r\nsitting-room, did the emperor invite him to rest after his fatiguing\r\nwalk.\r\n\r\n\"It has not fatigued me,\" replied Pius. \"It has interested me, on the\r\ncontrary, to traverse a palace which has been the residence of so many\r\npious princes. I esteem it a great privilege to inhabit these rooms\r\nwhose deceased occupants have each in his turn received the benediction\r\nof my honored predecessors--\"\r\n\r\n\"But who never were blessed by the love of their subjects,\" replied\r\nJoseph, interrupting him. \"To my mind, this is a blessing better worth\r\nstriving for than a papal benediction; and it is the aim of my life to\r\ndeserve it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless your majesty will reach your aim,\" replied the pope, with\r\ncourtesy. \"I have confidence in the rectitude of your majesty's\r\nintentions, and if I have made this pilgrimage to Vienna, it is because,\r\nrelying upon your honesty of purpose, I hope to convince you that it has\r\nbeen misapplied. The visit of the pope to the Austrian emperor is a\r\nconcession which I cheerfully make, if by that concession I can induce\r\nhim to pause in a career which has sorely wounded my heart, and has been\r\nthe occasion of so much scandal to our holy mother the church.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear that your holiness has been mistaken in your estimate of me,\"\r\nreplied Joseph, turning his flashing eyes upon the imploring face of the\r\npope. \"However I might be moved by the pathos of your words, a sovereign\r\nhas no right to listen to the pleadings of his heart. 'Tis the head that\r\nmust guide and influence his conduct. I fear, therefore, that your\r\nholiness will be disappointed in the result of your visit here. I accept\r\nyour journey to Vienna as a distinguished mark of your papal good-will,\r\nand am rejoiced to have it in my power to show all possible filial\r\nreverence to your holiness. Neither I nor my subjects will deny the\r\nconsideration which is due to the SPIRITUAL head of the church; but he\r\non his part must refrain from touching with his consecrated hand the\r\nthings of this world which concern him not.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is my duty to attend to all the affairs of holy church, whether\r\nspiritual or temporal,\" replied the pope, gently.\r\n\r\n\"The temporal affairs of the church concern your nuncio and my\r\nminister,\" said Joseph, with impatience. \"And as your holiness has\r\nentered at once upon a controversy with me respecting my acts toward the\r\nchurch, I declare distinctly to you that I shall not recede from the\r\nleast of them; and that your journey to Vienna, if its object is to\r\ninfluence my policy as sovereign of these realms, is already a failure.\r\nThe reasons for my conduct are satisfactory to me, and no power on earth\r\nshall move me from the position I have taken.\" [The emperor's words.\r\n-Hubner. i. p. 119.]\r\n\r\n\"I will not altogether give up the hope I have cherished of moving your\r\nmajesty's heart,\" replied the pope, earnestly. \"I shall continue to pray\r\nthat it may be my privilege to convince you of your errors and lead you\r\nback to the path of justice and of religion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which means that you expect me to retract!\" cried Joseph, impetuously.\r\n\"Never will I retract what I have said or done, for I act from\r\nconviction, and conviction does not slip off and on like a glove! But\r\nlet us speak no more on this subject. If your holiness will write down\r\nyour canonical objections to my proceedings against the church, I will\r\nlay them before my theologians for examination. My chancellor shall\r\nreply to them ministerially, and the correspondence can be published for\r\nthe edification of my subjects. Meanwhile, I shall endeavor to deserve\r\nthe good-will of your holiness by acting toward my honored guest the\r\npart of an obliging and hospitable host. This reminds me that I have\r\nalready trespassed upon your time, and have deprived you of the repose\r\nwhich a traveller always craves after a long journey. I hope that your\r\nholiness will overlook this intrusion, and pardon me if my great anxiety\r\nto enjoy your society has caused me to forget the consideration due to\r\nmy tired guest.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words the emperor retired. The pope followed his retreating\r\nfigure with a glance of profound sadness.\r\n\r\n\"I fear,\" thought he, \"that Joseph is indeed irreclaimable.\" Here he\r\nraised his soft dark eyes to heaven, and continued in a low murmur, \"For\r\na time the Lord endureth with mildness, but His mighty overcometh the\r\nblasphemer, and he vanisheth: while holy church remaineth unchangeable\r\nforever!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLIV.\r\n\r\nTHE FLIGHT.\r\n\r\n\"You persist in your refusal?\" cried Eskeles Flies, in an angry voice.\r\n\"You dare to oppose the will of your father?\"\r\n\r\n\"I persist in my refusal,\" replied Rachel firmly, lifting her dark,\r\ntearful eyes to her father's excited countenance. \"I must rebel against\r\nyour authority, my father, for you would compromise my earthly happiness\r\nand my salvation. Oh, dear father, do not harden your heart against me!\r\nIn mercy heed my prayers!\"\r\n\r\nWith these words Rachel would have thrown herself upon her father's\r\nbosom. But he thrust her from him.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis you who have hardened your heart against the law of God which bids\r\nthe child obey her father,\" cried he.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot recognize my father's authority when he oversteps his rights,\r\nand trenches upon mine as a human being,\" urged Rachel. \"I cannot\r\nperjure myself by accepting, as a husband, a man whom I do not love. He\r\nis a coarse, illiterate creature, who honors nothing but wealth, loves\r\nnothing but gold!\"\r\n\r\n\"He is the son of the richest merchant in Brussels, and the emperor has\r\nmade a nobleman of his father. He is your equal, or rather he is your\r\nsuperior, for he is richer, much richer than we.\"\r\n\r\n\"He my equal! He cannot understand me,\" cried Rachel.\r\n\r\nHer father laughed. \"Not your equal, because he does not go into\r\nraptures over young Mozart, and does not indulge in speculative\r\ntheology, but worships God after the manner of his fathers!--a Jew, in\r\nshort, who hates the Christian and glories in his Jewish birthright!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Rachel, shuddering, \"a Jew in feature, speech, and spirit.\r\nNot such a noble Israelite as you, my father, but a man possessing every\r\nrepulsive peculiarity which has made the Jew the pariah of the civilized\r\nworld. Oh, father, dear father, do not barter me for gold! Let me remain\r\nyour child, your darling; living and dying in the home which your love\r\nhas made like Eden to my girlhood!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have promised your hand to Baron von Meyer,\" was the curt reply.\r\n\r\n\"I will not give it!\" cried Rachel, frantically. \"You force me to\r\ndisobedience, by requiring of me that which is impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall force you to obedience, rebellious girl, for our laws invest\r\nthe father with absolute authority over his child, and I shall use my\r\nright to rescue you from dishonor. I read your heart, Rachel, and\r\ntherein I see written the history of your perfidy and shame.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you have read falsely,\" exclaimed Rachel, with indignation. \"Up to\r\nthis day I have kept the oath I made to remain a Jewess! And no mortal,\r\nwere he ten times my father, has the right to couple my name with\r\nperfidy or shame!\"\r\n\r\n\"You dare look me in the face and deny your disgrace!\" said her father,\r\ntrembling with anger. \"You, who at early morning in my own garden have\r\nlistened to the vows of a false-tongued Christian! You who have sworn to\r\nbe no man's wife, if not his!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you know all!\" cried Rachel, in accents of supreme joy. \"God be\r\npraised, there need be no more concealment between us! Yes, father, I\r\nlove Gunther, and if I be not permitted to become his wife, in the might\r\nof my love I would not scorn to be his handmaid! I have loved him since\r\nyou first brought him hither, and proudly presented him as the emperor's\r\nfavorite. Oh, my father, we were not rich then!\"\r\n\r\n\"No--and he would have scorned to ask you to wed him. Now he would\r\ndegrade the heiress of my wealth by seeking to make her his wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Degrade me!\" echoed Rachel, with a blush of indignation. \"I should be\r\nhonored by bearing his name, not because he is the emperor's favorite,\r\nbut because he is worthy of my love.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet, God be praised, Rachel Eskeles can never be the wife of a\r\nChristian!\" shouted the banker, triumphantly, \"for she has sworn by the\r\nmemory of her mother to die a Jewess!\"\r\n\r\n\"She will keep her oath unless her father release her,\" replied Rachel.\r\n\"But oh!\" added she, falling on her knees and raising her white arms\r\nabove her head, \"he will have pity upon the misery of his only child; he\r\nwill not condemn her to despair! Have mercy, have mercy, dear father! Be\r\nyour generous self, and take me to your heart. Release me, and let me\r\nbecome a Christian and the wife of my lover! He cares nothing for your\r\nwealth, he asks nothing but my hand!\"\r\n\r\nHer father glared at her with a look that seemed almost like hate. \"You\r\nare a Jewess,\" hissed he, \"and a Jewess you shall die!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am no Jewess at heart, father. I have been educated in a Christian\r\ncountry, and after the manner of Christian women. And you, too, have\r\nrenounced your birthright. You have eaten and drunk with the Gentiles;\r\nyou have cut your hair, and have adopted their dress. Nay, more! You\r\nhave parted with your name, and have accepted a Christian title. Why,\r\nthen, have you not the manliness to abjure the god of revenge and hate,\r\nand openly adore the Christian God of love and mercy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will live and die a Jew!\" cried the banker, choking with rage. \"I\r\nswear it again, and may I be accursed if I ever break my oath!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, father, release me from the lie that follows me like an evil\r\nshadow, blasting my life here and hereafter. Give me to my lover. Keep\r\nyour wealth to enrich your tribe, but give me your blessing and your\r\nlove!\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall remain a Jewess!\" thundered her father.\r\n\r\n\"Is this your last word?\" cried Rachel, springing to her feet. \"Is this\r\nyour last word?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" replied he, eying her with cold cruelty.\r\n\r\n\"Then hear my determination. I have sworn fidelity to Gunther, and if I\r\nmust choose between you, I give myself to him. I will not become a\r\nChristian, for such was my oath; but I will abjure Judaism.\"\r\n\r\n\"And become a Deist?\"\r\n\r\n\"Call it what you will. I shall adore the God of love and mercy.\"\r\n\r\n\"A Deist! Then you have never heard what punishment awaits the Deist\r\nhere. You do not know that the emperor, who affects toleration, has his\r\nvulnerable heel, and will not tolerate Deism. The gentle punishment\r\nwhich his majesty awards to Deism is--that of the lash. [Footnote:\r\nGross-Hoffinger, ii., p. 160.] So that I scarcely think you would dare\r\nme to accuse you of that! But pshaw! I go too far in my fears. My\r\ndaughter will recognize her folly, and yield her will to mine. She will\r\nbe, as she has ever been, my adored child, for whose happiness I can\r\nnever do too much; whose every wish it shall be my joy to gratify.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have but one wish--that of becoming the wife of Gunther.\"\r\n\r\nHer father affected not to hear her. \"Yes,\" continued he, \"she will\r\nverify my promise, and take the husband I have chosen. This marriage\r\nwill be a fine thing for both parties, for I give my daughter one-half\r\nmillion of florins, and Baron von Meyer gives his son a million cash\r\ndown. Then the father-in-law gives three hundred florins a month for\r\npin-money, and I seven hundred; so that Rachel has a thousand florins a\r\nmonth for her little caprices, and of this she is to render no account.\r\nThat is a pretty dower for a bride. I give my daughter a trousseau equal\r\nin magnificence to that of a princess. Upon her equipage, the arms of\r\nour two houses are already emblazoned, and to-morrow four of the finest\r\nhorses in Vienna will conduct the Baroness von Meyer to her husband's\r\npalace. I congratulate you, baroness. No Christian woman in Vienna shall\r\nhave an establishment like yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall never be the Baroness von Meyer,\" said Rachel, calmly, but an\r\nicy chill ran through her veins, for she loved her father, and felt that\r\nthey must shortly part forever.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you will be the Baroness von Meyer to-morrow. I have anticipated\r\nall your objections. The rabbi that is to marry you is a Pole. He will\r\nnot understand your reply, and the young baron has magnanimously\r\nconsented to overlook any little informality of which your folly may be\r\nthe cause; for he likes money, and is too good a Jew not to aid me in\r\nrescuing my heiress from disgrace. You see that your poor little\r\nstruggles will all be in vain. Resign yourself, then, and accept the\r\nbrilliant destiny which awaits you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will sooner die than consign myself to misery and disgrace!\"\r\n\r\n\"Be easy on that subject. God will shield you from misery, and your\r\nfather's watchful eye will see that you do not consign yourself to\r\ndisgrace,\" replied the banker, coldly. \"But enough of words. Night sets\r\nin, and I have yet a few preparations to make for tomorrow. It is proper\r\nthat you pass the last evening of your maiden life in solitude, and that\r\nyou may not spend it in weariness, I have ordered your drawing-rooms to\r\nbe lighted, and your trousseau to be laid out for your inspection. Go,\r\nand gladden your heart with its magnificence. Good-night.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Baron Eskeles Flies left the room. Rachel heard him turn the\r\nkey in the lock, and withdraw it. She then remembered that the\r\ndrawing-rooms were lighted. Perhaps her father had neglected to fasten\r\nsome of the doors leading thence into the hall. She sprang to the door\r\nof communication, and flung it open. The rooms were brilliantly\r\nilluminated, and the sparkling chandeliers of crystal looked down upon a\r\nwilderness of velvet, satin, flowers, lace, and jewels--truly a\r\ntrousseau for a princess.\r\n\r\nBut what cared Rachel for this? Indeed, she saw nothing, save the\r\ndistant doors toward which she sped like a frightened doe. Alas! they,\r\ntoo, were locked, and the only answers to her frantic calls were the\r\nmocking echoes of her own voice.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments she leaned against the wall for support; then her\r\nglance took in the long perspective of magnificence which was to gild\r\nthe hideous sacrifice of a whole human life, and she murmured, softly:\r\n\r\n\"I must be free. I cannot perjure myself. I shall keep my vow to Gunther\r\nor die! My father is no father--he is my jailer, and I owe him no longer\r\nthe obedience of a child.\"\r\n\r\nShe went slowly back, revolving in her mind what she should do.\r\nUnconsciously she paused before a table resplendent with trinkets, whose\r\nsurpassing beauty seemed to woo the young girl to her fate. But Rachel\r\nwas no longer a maiden to be allured by dress. The exigencies of the\r\nhour had transformed her into a brave woman, who was donning her armor\r\nand preparing for the fight.\r\n\r\n\"Gunther awaits me,\" said she, musing.\r\n\r\nBut why--where? that she could not say. But she felt that she must free\r\nherself from prison, and that her fate now lay in her own hands.\r\n\r\nAt that moment she stood before a large round table which was just under\r\nthe principal chandelier of her superb reception-room. Here lay dainty\r\nboxes containing laces, and caskets enclosing jewels. Not for one moment\r\ndid she think of their contents. She saw but the gilt letters which were\r\nimpressed upon the red morocco cases.\r\n\r\n\"RACHEL VON MEYER\" was on every box and case. In her father's mind she\r\nalready bore another name.\r\n\r\n\"Rachel von Meyer!\" said she, with a shudder. \"My father denies me his\r\nname! Who, then, am I?\"\r\n\r\nA flush of modest shame overspread her face, as scarcely daring to\r\narticulate the words, she knelt, and murmured:\r\n\r\n\"I am Rachel Gunther. And if such be my name,\" continued she, after a\r\npause of rapture, \"I have no right to be here amid the treasures of the\r\nBaroness von Meyer. I must away from this house, which is no longer a\r\nhome for me. Away, away! for Gunther awaits me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now she looked with despair at the locked doors and the lofty\r\nwindows, so far, far from the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if I had but wings!--I, who am here a prisoner, while my heart is\r\naway with him!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly she gave a start, for deliverance was possible. She looked from\r\nthe window as if to measure its height, and then she darted through the\r\nrooms until she saw a table covered with silks. She took thence a roll\r\nof white, heavy ribbon, and, throwing it before her, exclaimed joyfully:\r\n\r\n\"It is long, oh, it is quite long enough. And strong enough to support\r\nme. Thank Heaven! it is dark, and I shall not he seen. A gold ducat will\r\nbribe the guard at the postern--and then I am free!\"\r\n\r\nShe returned to her sitting-room, and, with trembling haste, threw a\r\ndark mantle around her. Then, looking up at her father's portrait, her\r\neyes filled with bitter tears.\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, my father, farewell!\"\r\n\r\nScarcely knowing what she did, she fled from her room, and returned to\r\nthe only object which possessed any more interest for her there, the\r\nlong, long ribbon which, like a gigantic serpent, lay glistening on the\r\nfloor where she had unrolled it. She stooped to pick it up, and trailing\r\nit after her, she flew from room to room, until she came to the last one\r\nof the suite which overlooked the park. She opened a window, and\r\nlistened.\r\n\r\nNothing was heard there save the \"warbling wind,\" that wooed the young\r\nbranches, and here and there a little bird that ventured its note upon\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nRachel secured the ribbon to the crosswork of the window, and then let\r\nit fall below. Once more she listened. She could almost hear the\r\nbeatings of her own heart, but nothing else broke the silence of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nShe gave one quick glance around her beautiful home were lay all the\r\nsplendor that might have been hers, and grasping the ribbon firmly in\r\nher hands, she dropped from the window to the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLV.\r\n\r\nTHE MARRIAGE BEFORE GOD.\r\n\r\nGunther had returned from the palace to his own lodgings in the city.\r\nHere, the labors of the day over, he sat dreaming of his love, wondering\r\nwhether she thought of him during these dreary weeks of their forced\r\nparting.\r\n\r\nHe had stretched himself upon a divan, and, with his head thrown back\r\nupon the cushion, he gave himself up to thoughts of that love which was\r\nat once the greatest grief and the greatest joy of his life.\r\n\r\n\"Will it ever end?\" thought he. \"Will she ever consent to leave that\r\nprincely home for me?\"\r\n\r\nSometimes a cloud came over his handsome, noble features, sometimes the\r\nsunlight of happiness broke over them, and then he smiled. And on he\r\ndreamed, happy or unhappy, as he fancied that Rachel was his, or was\r\nparted from him forever.\r\n\r\nThe door-bell rang with a clang that startled him. But what to him was\r\nthe impatience of those who sought admittance to his house? He had\r\nalmost begun to fancy that Rachel was before him, and he was vexed at\r\nthe intrusion.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the door of his room had been softly opened, but Gunther had\r\nnot heard it. He heard or saw nothing but his peerless Rachel. She was\r\nthere with her lustrous eyes, her silky hair, her pale and beautiful\r\nfeatures. She was there.\r\n\r\nWhat! Did he dream? She was before him, but paler than her wont, her\r\ndark eyes fixed upon him with a pleading look, her lithe figure swaying\r\nfrom side to side, as with uncertain footsteps she seemed to be\r\napproaching his couch. Good God! Was it an apparition? What had\r\nhappened?\r\n\r\nGunther started to his feet, and cried out, \"O my Rachel, my beloved!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is I,\" said she, in a faltering voice. \"Before you take me to your\r\nheart, hear me, Gunther. I have fled from my father's house forever--for\r\nhe would have sold me to a man whom I abhor, and whom I could never have\r\nmarried, had my heart been free. I bring neither gold nor jewels. I come\r\nto you a beggar--my inheritance a father's curse, my dowry naught but my\r\nlove and faith. So dowered and so portioned, will you take me, Gunther?\"\r\n\r\nGunther looked upon his love with eyes wherein she must have read\r\nconsolation for all her trials, for her sweet lips parted with a happy\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"My treasure!\" was his reply, as he took her little trembling hand, and\r\npressed it fondly within his own. \"Come, my Rachel, come and see how I\r\nhave longed for this day.\"\r\n\r\nHe drew her forward, and opened a door opposite to the one by which she\r\nhad entered.\r\n\r\n\"Come, your home is ready, my own.\"\r\n\r\nThey entered together, and Rachel found herself in a drawing-room where\r\ntaste and elegance amply atoned for the absence of splendor.\r\n\r\n\"Now, see your sitting-room.\"\r\n\r\nNothing could be more cheerful or homelike than the appointments of this\r\ncosy apartment, lighted like the drawing-room by a tasteful chandelier.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" said Gtinther, pointing to a door, \"is your dressing-room, and\r\nwithin, your chamber, my Rachel. For six months this dwelling has\r\nawaited its mistress, and that she might never enter it unawares, it has\r\nbeen nightly lighted for her coming. I was almost tempted to despair,\r\nbeloved. You have saved me from a discouragement that was undermining my\r\nhealth. Now you are here, and all is well. When shall the priest bless\r\nour nuptials! This very night, shall he not, my bride?\"\r\n\r\n\"He can never bless them,\" replied Rachel, solemnly.\r\n\r\nGunther turned pale.\r\n\r\n\"Never? You have not, then, come to be my wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot be your wife according to human rites, Gunther, for well you\r\nknow that I have sworn never to become a Christian. But I am yours for\r\ntime and eternity, and knowing my own heart, I accept the world's scorn\r\nfor your dear sake. Earth refuses to bless our nuptials, but God will\r\nhear our vows. Gunther, will you reject me because I am a Jewess?\"\r\n\r\nGunther imprinted a kiss upon her forehead, and sank on his knees before\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"Rachel,\" said he, raising his right hand to heaven, \"I swear to love\r\nyou for better or for worse, devoting my life to your happiness. On my\r\nknees I swear before God to honor you as my wife, and to be faithful and\r\ntrue to you until death does us part.\"\r\n\r\nRachel then knelt at his side, and, laying her hand in his repeated her\r\nvows. Then they kissed each other, and Gunther, taking her in his arms,\r\npressed her to his throbbing heart.\r\n\r\n\"We are husband and wife,\" said he. \"God has received our vows, and now,\r\nRachel, you are mine, for He has blessed and sanctioned your entrance\r\ninto my house!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLVI.\r\n\r\nTHE PARK.\r\n\r\nThe first days of a smiling spring had filled the park with hundreds of\r\nsplendid equipages and prancing horsemen. There was the carriage of the\r\nPrincess Esterhazy, with twenty outriders in the livery of the prince;\r\nthat of the new Prince Palm, whose four black horses wore their harness\r\nof pure gold; there was the gilded fairy, like vis-a-vis of the\r\nbeautiful Countess Thun, its panels decorated with paintings from the\r\nhands of one of the first artists of the day; the coach of the Countess\r\nDietrichstein, drawn by four milk-white horses, whose delicate pasterns\r\nwere encircled by jewelled bracelets worthy of glittering upon the arm\r\nof a beauty. In short, the aristocracy of Austria, Hungary, and Lombardy\r\nwere there, in all the splendor of their wealth and rank. It seemed as\r\nthough Spring were holding a levee, and the nobles of the empire had\r\nthronged her flowery courts.\r\n\r\nNot only they, but the people, too, had come to greet young Spring. They\r\ncrowded the footpaths, eager to scent the balmy air, to refresh their\r\neyes with the sight of the velvet turf, and to enjoy the pageant\r\npresented to their wondering eyes by the magnificent turn-outs of the\r\naristocracy. Thousands and thousands filled the alleys and outlets of\r\nthe park, all directing their steps toward the centre, for there the\r\nemperor and his court were to be seen. There the people might gaze, in\r\nclose proximity, at the dainty beauties, whom they knew as the denizens\r\nof another earthly sphere; there they might elbow greatness, and there,\r\nabove all, they might feast their eyes upon the emperor, who, simply\r\ndressed, rode to and fro, stopping his horse to chat, as often with a\r\npeasant as with a peer.\r\n\r\nThe emperor dismounted, and this was the signal for all other cavaliers\r\nto dismount and accompany him. The ladies also were compelled to rise\r\nfrom their velvet cushions and to tread the ground with their\r\nsilken-slippered feet. Their equipages were crowded together on one side\r\nof the square, and around them the horses, now held by their liveried\r\njockeys, were champing their bits and pawing the ground with restless\r\nhoofs.\r\n\r\nThe crowd was so dense, that the patrician and plebeian stood side by\r\nside. The people, in their innocent enjoyment of the scene, broke\r\nseveral times through the ranks of titled promenaders, who, vainly\r\nhoping to find some spot unprofaned by the vicinity of the vulgar herd,\r\nwere moving toward the centre of the garden.\r\n\r\nThe emperor saw the lowering brows of his courtiers, and knew that their\r\nangry glances were directed toward the people.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter with you, my lords?\" asked he. \"You are the picture\r\nof discontent. Pray, Count Furstenberg, speak for the court. What has\r\nhappened to discompose your equanimity?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know, your majesty,\" stammered the count.\r\n\r\n\"And yet you frown terribly,\" laughed Joseph. \"Come--no concealment.\r\nWhat has vexed you all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty commands?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"If so, sire, we are annoyed by the vulgar curiosity of the populace,\r\nwho gape in our faces as if we were South Sea Islanders or specimens of\r\nfossil life.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, the curiosity of the Viennese is somewhat troublesome,\" replied\r\nthe emperor, smiling: \"but let us call this eagerness to be with us,\r\nlove, and then it will cease to be irksome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, your majesty, if I venture to say that under any aspect it\r\nwould be most irksome to us. If your majesty will excuse my freedom, I\r\nthink that in opening all the gardens to the people, you have made too\r\ngreat a concession to their convenience.\"\r\n\r\n\"You really think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire, and I beg you to hear the request I have to prefer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak on, count.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, your majesty; in the name of every nobleman in Vienna, and, above\r\nall, in the name of our noble ladies. I beseech of you grant us the\r\nexclusive privilege of ONE garden, where we may meet, unmolested by the\r\nrabble. Give us the use of the Prater, that we may have some spot in\r\nVienna where we can breathe the fresh air in the company of our equals\r\nalone.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor had listened with a supercilious smile. \"You desire to see\r\nnone but your equals, say you? If I were to indulge in a similar whim, I\r\nshould have to seek companionship in the crypts of the Capuchins.\r\n[Footnote: The emperor's own words. Ramshorn's \"Life of Joseph II.\"] But\r\nfor my part I hold all men as my equals, and my noble subjects will be\r\nobliged to follow my example. I shall certainly not close any of the\r\ngardens against the people, for I esteem and love them.\" [Footnote: When\r\nthe emperor opened the park to the people, he caused the following\r\ninscription to be placed over the principal entrance: \"Dedicated to all\r\nmen, by one who esteems them.\"]\r\n\r\nThe emperor, as he concluded, bowed and turned to greet the Countess\r\nPergen.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome, countess, to Vienna,\" said he, bowing. \"You have been away for\r\nsome time. May I inquire how you are?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tres-bien, volre majeste,\" replied the countess, with a profound\r\ncourtesy.\r\n\r\nThe emperor frowned. \"Why do you not speak German?\" said he, curtly. \"We\r\nare certainly in Germany. \"\r\n\r\nAnd without saying another word to the discomfited lady, he turned his\r\nback upon her. Suddenly his face brightened, and he pressed eagerly\r\nthrough the crowd, toward a pale young man, who met his smiling gaze\r\nwith one of reciprocal friendliness.\r\n\r\nJoseph extended his hand, and his courtiers saw with surprise that this\r\nperson, whose brown coat was without a single order, instead of raising\r\nthe emperor's hand to his lips, as was customary at court, shook it as\r\nif they had been equals.\r\n\r\n\"See,\" cried Joseph, \"here is our young maestro, Mozart. Did you come to\r\nthe park to-day to teach the nightingales to sing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven forbid, your majesty; rather would I learn from the tuneful\r\nsongsters whom God has taught. Perhaps some of these days I may try to\r\nimitate their notes myself.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor laid his hand upon Mozart's shoulder and looked with\r\nenthusiasm into his pale, inspired countenance. \"Mozart has no need to\r\nlearn from the nightingale,\" said he, \"for God has filled his heart with\r\nmelody, and he has only to transfer it to paper to ravish the world with\r\nits strains. Now for your 'Abduction from the Auge Gottes'--nay, do not\r\nblush; I am a child of Vienna, and must have my jest with the Viennese.\r\nTell me--which gave you most trouble, that or your opera 'Die Entfuhrung\r\naus dem Serail?'\" [Footnote: On the day of the representation of the\r\nopera \"Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail,\" in Vienna, Mozart ran away with\r\nhis Constance. He conducted her to the house of a common friend, where\r\nthey were married. This same friend brought about a reconciliation with\r\nthe mother of Constance. The house in which the widow and her daughter\r\nlived was called \"Das Auge Gottes,\" and the Viennese, who knew the\r\nhistory of Mozart's marriage, had called it \"Die Entfuhrung aus dem Auge\r\nGottes.\"--Lissen's \"Life of Mozart.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Truly,\" replied Mozart, still somewhat embarrassed, \"the abduction from\r\nthe Auge Gottes, sire. I had to sigh and sue until I was nigh unto\r\ndespair before I was successful.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you concluded both works on the same day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire. First, that which lay in my head, and then that which was\r\nnearest my heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"I congratulate you upon the success of both. 'Die Entfuhrung aus dem\r\nSerail' is a charming opera. Charming, but it contains too many notes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only as many as were necessary, sire,\" said Mozart, looking full in the\r\nemperor's face.\r\n\r\nJoseph smiled. \"Perhaps so, for you must be a better judge of the\r\nnecessity than I. For that very reason,\" added he, lowering his voice to\r\na whisper, \"I have sent you my sonata for revision. Like all\r\ninexperienced composers, I am anxious to know my fate. Tell me, what do\r\nyou think of my sonata, Herr Kapellmeister?\"\r\n\r\nMozart was silent, while the emperor waited anxiously for his reply.\r\n\"Why do you not speak?\" said he, impatiently. \"Tell me, what do you\r\nthink of my sonata?\"\r\n\r\n\"The sonata, sire, is--good,\" returned Mozart, with some hesitation;\r\n\"but he who composed it,\" added he, smiling, \"is much better. Your\r\nmajesty must not take it ill if you find some of your passages stricken\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor laughed. \"Ah!--too many notes, as I just now remarked of\r\nyour opera--only that from your judgment there can be no appeal.\r\nWell--give us a new opera, and let it be comic. Music should rejoice,\r\nnot grieve us. Addio.\" [Footnote: This interview is strictly\r\nhistorical.--Lissen's \"Life of Mozart.\"]\r\n\r\nHe then returned to the group which he had left, none of whom seemed to\r\nhave been much comforted by the familiarity of the emperor with a poor\r\nlittle kapellmeister.\r\n\r\n\"My hour of recreation is over,\" said Joseph, \"but as you know that I am\r\nno lover of etiquette, let no one retire on my account. I know where to\r\nfind my equerry, and prefer to find him alone.\" With these words he\r\nturned away.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he was seen to stop and frown visibly. With a quick motion of\r\nthe hand he signed to Count Podstadsky-Liechtenstein to approach.\r\n\r\nAs Podstadsky was about to make a profound inclination, the emperor\r\ninterrupted him roughly. \"No ceremony--we have no time to be\r\ncomplimentary. What are you doing in Vienna?\"\r\n\r\nThe count saw that his sovereign was angry. \"Sire,\" replied he, \"I spend\r\nmy time just as it happens--\"\r\n\r\n\"That is, you ride, walk, gamble, and carouse, when you are doing\r\nnothing worse. I thought you had left Vienna. You had better go upon\r\nyour estates and attend to the welfare of your vassals. Idleness is the\r\nparent of crime, and I fear that if you remain another day in Vienna,\r\nyou will bring disgrace upon your father's name. Go at once.\" [Footnote:\r\nThe emperor's own words to Podstadsky.--\"Anecdotes, etc., of the\r\nEmperor Joseph II.\"]\r\n\r\nCount Podstadsky looked in wonder after the emperor. \"Is this accident\r\nor design? Does he suspect something, or is he only trying to induce me\r\nto work, as he does every nobleman? Ah, bah!--I must see Arabella, and\r\nhear what she thinks of it!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLVII.\r\n\r\nTHE PARTING.\r\n\r\nThey sat together in the little boudoir which had so often rung with\r\ntheir laughter, and where they had so often sneered at their titled\r\ndupes in Vienna.\r\n\r\nThere was no laughter to-day: the beautiful features of the Countess\r\nBaillou were contracted with alarm, and the frivolous Podstadsky was\r\nthoughtful and serious.\r\n\r\nThe countess was superbly dressed. A rich robe of velvet, embroidered\r\nwith gold, fell in heavy, glistening folds around her graceful figure; a\r\ndiadem of brilliants sparkled like a constellation upon the blackness of\r\nher luxuriant hair, and her exquisite neck and arms were covered with\r\ncostly gems. She had just completed her toilet for a dinner given by the\r\nPrincess Karl Liechtenstein, when Podstadsky had met her with the\r\nalarming intelligence which had obliged her to send an excuse.\r\n\r\nFor one whole hour they had been considering their situation--\r\nconsidering those words of the emperor; now planning one method of\r\nescape, now another,\r\n\r\n\"Then you do not believe that the danger is imminent?\" said Podstadsky,\r\nafter along, anxious pause.\r\n\r\n\"I do not,\" replied the countess, \"The emperor has always been fond of\r\nadvising other people, and of humbling the Austrian aristocracy above\r\nall, when the people are by to hear him, and he can make capital out of\r\nit to increase his popularity. I suppose his rudeness to you was all\r\nassumed, to make an impression upon the foolish populace. That is all.\"\r\n\r\nPodstadsky shook his head. \"The tone of the emperor was so pointed--it\r\nseemed as though some special meaning lay in his words.\"\r\n\r\n\"That, my dear Carlo, simply means that fear caused you to interpret\r\nthem significantly.\"\r\n\r\n\"The words themselves were significant enough; and his look!--Oh,\r\nArabella, we are in danger! Dearest let us fly, fly at once!\"\r\n\r\nHe had risen, and, in his anguish, had tried to draw her to himself. She\r\nput him quietly away, and contemplated him with a sneer. \"No folly!\"\r\nsaid She. \"Even if the emperor had meant to warn you, his warning came\r\ntoo late to save you from the watchful police of Vienna.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Arabella. I tell you that the emperor will facilitate my escape\r\nfor my parents' sake. Oh, why did I not obey, and mount my horse at\r\nonce, and fly to some sequestered vale where I might have found refuge\r\nfrom dishonor?\"\r\n\r\n\"And where you might realize your mother's touching dream of becoming a\r\nboor, and repenting your sins in sackcloth and ashes! That maternal idyl\r\nstill troubles your poor, shallow brain, does it? For my part, I think\r\nno spectacle on earth is so ridiculous as that of the repentant sinner.\r\nIt is the most humiliating character in which a man can appear before\r\nthe world, and it is unworthy of you, Carlo. Hold up your head and look\r\nthis phantom of dancer in the face. It is but a phantom. The bright,\r\nbeautiful reality of our luxurious life is substantially before us. Away\r\nwith cowardice! He who treads the path which we have trodden, must cast\r\nall fear behind him. Had we been scrupulous, or faint-hearted, you would\r\nhave been to-day a ruined nobleman, dependent upon the pittance doled\r\nout to you from parental hands, or upon some little office pompously\r\nbestowed by the emperor; and I--ha! ha!--I should have been a\r\npsalm-chanting nun, with other drowsy nuns for my companions through\r\nlife, and a chance of dying in the odor of sanctity! We were too wise\r\nfor that; and now the structure of our fortunes is complete. Its gilded\r\ndome reaches into the heaven of the most exclusive circles; princes,\r\ndukes, and sovereigns are our guests. In the name of all for which we\r\nhave striven, Carlo, what would you have more?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid that the structure will fall and bury us under its ruins,\"\r\nsaid Carlo, shivering.\r\n\r\n\"Better that than inglorious flight. Stay where you are; show a bold\r\nfront, and that will disarm suspicion. Why do you gaze at me so\r\nstrangely?\"\r\n\r\n\"I gaze at you because you are so beautiful,\" replied he, with a faint\r\nsmile, \"as beautiful as was that fallen angel who compassed the ruin of\r\nman!\"\r\n\r\n\"I AM a fallen angel,\" returned she, proudly, \"and you know it. Together\r\nwe fell, together we have risen. So long as we smile, we shall compass\r\nthe ruin of many men; but if once we frown, we shall be known as evil\r\nspirits, and our power is at an end. Smiles are the talismans that\r\ninsure victory; so smile, Carlo, smile and be gay.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot, I cannot. My veins are chilled with vague terror, and ever\r\nbefore my eyes comes the pale and anguish-stricken face of my mother!\r\nArabella, if you will not leave this accursed spot, let us die. Better\r\nis death than the dungeon and disgrace!\"\r\n\r\nHe threw his arms around her, and pressed his hot, parched lips to hers.\r\nAgain she disengaged herself, and her musical laugh rang out upon the\r\nstillness--clear, merry, silvery as ever. \"Die! Are you tired of\r\npleasure? I am not. I shall yet have many an intoxicating draught from\r\nits golden beaker. Die! As if we knew what came after death! But come; I\r\npity your state of mind, and since you can no longer be happy in Vienna,\r\nwe shall travel. Mark you! I say TRAVEL; but there shall be no flight \"\r\n\r\nCount Podstadsky uttered a cry of wild joy, and pressed the hand she\r\ngave him to his lips. \"When shall we travel? Now?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \"That were flight. We start to-morrow \"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow!\" cried he, exultingly, \"to-morrow, at dawn of day?\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means. To-morrow at noon, in the sight of the whole world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be it so, then,\" sighed the count. \"We go by different roads, and meet\r\nat Neustadt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, at Neustadt. And now go, Carlo. We both have important\r\narrangements to make before we leave.\"\r\n\r\n\"_I_ have very little to do,\" laughed Podstadsky, who had already\r\nrecovered his spirits. \"My valuables all belong to the usurers. For some\r\ntime past they have stationed an agent of theirs in my house as steward.\r\nHe watches over their property; I have no interest in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you pay them with your nice new bank-notes--hey, Carlo?\"\r\n\r\nCarlo grew troubled again. \"I did try to do so, but they refused. They\r\nhad given me gold, and must have gold in return.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the better. Your bank-notes will meet with a better reception\r\nelsewhere,\" said Arabella, hurriedly. \"But come, let us go to work. Burn\r\nall indiscreet papers, and take every thing that you can secrete. And\r\nnow away with you! I must be alone, for I have enough to do to keep me\r\nup this livelong night. Clear your brows, my Carlo, and sleep free from\r\nanxiety. To-morrow we leave Vienna, and your trials will be at an end.\r\nAddio, caro amico mio, addio!\"\r\n\r\nHe kissed her hand, and she accompanied him to the door. He closed it\r\nbehind him, while she stood breathless, listening to his retreating\r\nfootsteps. Now he was on the staircase. The heavy street door closed--a\r\nmoment's delay, and his carriage rolled away. Yes, he was off at last.\r\nThank Heaven, he was off!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLVIII.\r\n\r\nCOLONEL SZEKULY.\r\n\r\nArabella listened--listened until the sound of the wheels had died away;\r\nthen she laughed. \"He thinks me fool enough to share his disgrace! As if\r\nI had not long ago foreseen that this was to be the end of that\r\nhair-brained fool! In expectation of HIS fate, I have been countermining\r\nwith Szekuly, and his foolish old hands have flung up shovelfuls of gold\r\nas we went along--bright, shining ducats, which shall go with me to\r\nParis. Now I am free, free from my dangerous accomplice, free from my\r\ntiresome old adorer, whose love for me so nearly approaches insanity\r\nthat it may lead him to compromise himself in more ways than one. But he\r\nmust not compromise me! For the world, as yet, I am the modest, virtuous\r\nCountess Baillou, chaste as I am beautiful!\"\r\n\r\nWhile she soliloquized thus, the countess walked hurriedly through the\r\nroom, with folded arms, fiery eyes, and on her lips a smile--but what a\r\nsmile! Alone in that gorgeous apartment, with her sinister beauty and\r\nher angry, flashing jewels, she might have been mistaken for a malign\r\nspirit who had just left her kingdom of darkness to visit the earth with\r\nruin!\r\n\r\n\"It is evident,\" said she, musing, \"that the emperor meant to warn him;\r\nand it follows that as he has not fled to-day he is lost! And he SHALL\r\nbe lost, for I must be free. I cannot afford to share my hardly-earned\r\nwinnings with him. He must away to prison; it is my only chance for\r\nfreedom.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if, after all, the emperor should connive at his escape! Or if he\r\nshould be seized with a fit of suspicion, and return! Good Heaven! now\r\nthat fortune favors me, I must snatch security while it lies within my\r\ngrasp.\"\r\n\r\nHere she rang so violently, that the valet, who was in the anteroom\r\nalmost precipitated himself into her presence.\r\n\r\n\"If Count Podstadsky-Liechtenstein calls, say that I am not at home.\r\nApprise the other servants, and add that be is never to find admittance\r\ninto this house again. Whosoever, after this, admits him even to the\r\nvestibule, shall leave my service. Away with you!\"\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" continued she, as the valet closed the door, \"now to work.\"\r\nShe went toward a mirror, and there unfastened her diadem, then her\r\nnecklace, brooch, and bracelets. With her hands full of jewels, she flew\r\nto her dressing-room and deposited them in their respective cases. Then\r\nshe opened a large, brass-bound casket, and counted her treasures.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that came to light was a necklace of diamond solitaires.\r\n\"These three stars of the first magnitude,\" said she, contemplating the\r\ncentre stones, \"are the involuntary contribution of the Princess Garampi\r\nI borrowed her bracelet for a model, giving my word that it should not\r\npass from my hands. Nor has it done so, for I have kept her brilliants\r\nand returned her--mine. She is never the wiser, and I am the richer\r\nthereby. For this string of pearls, with the superb ruby clasp, I am\r\nindebted to her highness the Princess Palm. One evening, as I welcomed\r\nher with an embrace, I made out to unfasten it while I related to her a\r\npiquant anecdote of her husband's mistress. Of course she was too much\r\nabsorbed in my narrative to feel that her necklace was slipping, for I\r\nwas not only entertaining, but very caressing on the occasion. There was\r\nmusic in the room, so that no one heard the treasure fall. The necklace,\r\na perfect fortune, lay at my feet; I moved my train to cover it, and\r\nsigned to Carlo, who, I must say, was always within call. He invited the\r\nprincess to dance, and--the pearls found their way to my pocket. What a\r\ntalk that loss made in Vienna! What offers of reward that poor woman\r\nmade to recover her necklace! All in vain, and nobody condoled more\r\naffectionately with her than the charming, kind-hearted Countess\r\nBaillou. This sorrow--but, pshaw! what a child I am, to be gloating over\r\nmy precious toys while time passes away, and I must be off to-night!\"\r\n\r\nShe closed her boxes, replaced them in her strong, well-secured casket,\r\nand, having locked it, hung the key around her neck. \"Here lies the\r\nprice of a princely estate,\" said she, \"and now I must attend to my\r\nducats.\"\r\n\r\nShe stood upon a chair, and took from the wall a picture. Then, pressing\r\na spring behind it a little door flew open, revealing a casket similar\r\nto the one containing her jewels. She took it down, and, placing it on\r\nthe table, contemplated the two boxes with profound satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty thousand lovers' eyes look out from this casket,\" said she, with\r\na laugh; \"all promising a future of triumphant joy. Twenty thousand\r\nducats! The fruits of my savings! And dear old Szekuly has made economy\r\nvery easy for some months past, for one-half of these ducats once\r\nbelonged to him. To be sure, I gave him in return the deeds of an entail\r\nwhich I own in Italy, and which he can easily reconvert into money. At\r\nleast he thinks so. Well--I owe him nothing. We made an exchange, and\r\nthat is all.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this edifying monologue, the countess exchanged her elegant\r\ncostume for a simple travelling-dress, and as she completed her toilet\r\nthe clock struck eight. Every thing being ready, she returned to her\r\nboudoir and rang once. This signified that her confidential valet was\r\nwanted. In a few moments the door opened, and an old man, whose dark\r\nhair and eyes marked his Italian birth, entered noiselessly. The\r\ncountess bade him close the door and approach. He obeyed without the\r\nleast manifestation of surprise, muttering as he went, \"Walls have\r\nears.\"\r\n\r\n\"Giuseppe,\" said his mistress, \"are you still willing to follow me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did I not swear to your mother, my beloved benefactress, never to\r\nabandon you, signora?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, amico; then we leave Vienna to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard the order forbidding Count Podstadsky the house, signora, and I\r\nmade ready to depart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good and faithful Giuseppe! Since you are ready, nothing need detain\r\nus. Go at once and order post-horses, and come with the travelling\r\ncarriage to the corner of the street above this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Si, signora; I shall leave the carriage there, and return for the two\r\ncaskets; you will then go out by the postern, and having joined us, we\r\nare off. Is that your will?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Giuseppe, yes. Go for your life!\"\r\n\r\n\"Be ready to leave the house in one hour, signora, for you know that I\r\nam a swift messenger.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man bowed and retreated as silently as he came. His mistress\r\nlooked after him, saying, \"There goes a jewel which I have neither\r\nborrowed nor stolen: it comes to me by the inalienable right of\r\ninheritance. Now I can rest until he returns.\"\r\n\r\nWith a deep sigh of relief, she threw herself upon the divan, and,\r\nclosing her eyes, gave herself up to rosy dreams. She had not lain long,\r\nbefore the door opened and a valet announced \"Colonel Szekuly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot receive him,\" exclaimed she, without rising.\r\n\r\n\"You must receive him, countess,\" said a voice behind her, and starting\r\nfrom the divan, she beheld the tall form of her \"tiresome old adorer,\"\r\nenveloped in a military cloak, with his plumed hat drawn far over his\r\nbrow. Before she had time to speak, he had dismissed the valet and\r\nclosed the door.\r\n\r\n\"You presume strangely upon your influence,\" cried Arabella, half\r\namused, half angry. \"Because you reign over my heart, you aspire to\r\nreign over my domestics, I perceive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Peace!\" cried the colonel, imperatively. \"I have not come hither to\r\nsuck poison from your honeyed lips. I have already had enough to cause\r\nmy death. Though you have cruelly deceived me, I come to give you a last\r\nproof of my love. Do not interrupt me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not breathe.\" said she, with a smile so bewitching, that Szekuly\r\naverted his eyes, for it maddened him.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" said he, and the old man's voice faltered as he spoke, \"that\r\nthe director of police is my friend. I had invited him to dine with me.\r\nHe came but half an hour ago to excuse himself because of an arrest of\r\nsome importance. Do you guess whose arrest?\"\r\n\r\n\"How should I guess?\" said she, still with that enchanting smile. \"I\r\nhave no acquaintance with the police.\"\r\n\r\n\"God grant that you may never make their acquaintance!\" ejaculated he,\r\nhoarsely. \"They have just now arrested Count Podstadsky.\"\r\n\r\nNot a feature of her face changed, as she replied: \"Ah! Count Podstadsky\r\narrested? I am sorry to hear it. Can you tell me why?\"\r\n\r\n\"For forging bank-notes to the amount of a million of florins.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suspected as much; I have several times been the victim of his\r\nthousand-florin notes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The victim, countess? Is that an appropriate expression?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it is,\" replied she, quietly. \"Is that all the news?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, countess. The count is taken, but his accomplice--\"\r\n\r\nShe breathed quickly and her mouth quivered, but she rallied and made\r\nanswer. \"He had accomplices?\"\r\n\r\n\"He had an accomplice, and--hush! we have no time for falsehood. Every\r\nmoment is precious to you. Perhaps the director of the police came to me\r\nbecause knowing how--I have loved you, he would rescue you from shame.\r\nLet us hope that he did, for he told me that he had orders to arrest the\r\nCountess Baillou.\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\" asked she, almost inaudibly; and now her face was pale as death.\r\n\r\n\"At dusk, that you might be spared the curiosity of a crowd.\"\r\n\r\nArabella sprang from her couch. \"It is already night!\" cried she, her\r\nvoice rising almost to a scream.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied her lover, \"but I hope we have time. I have prepared\r\neverything for your flight. My carriage and postilions await you in the\r\nnext street. Be quick, and you may escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" exclaimed she. \"Give me but one moment.\" She flew to her\r\ndressing-room, and tried to carry her two boxes. But the ducats were too\r\nheavy.\r\n\r\n\"I must leave the jewels,\" said she; and climbing up again with her\r\ncasket, she concealed it in the wall, and replaced the picture. \"It is,\r\nat all events, perfectly safe, and Giuseppe will come for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" cried Szekuly from the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\"I come,\" answered she, while she wrapped a cloak about her and with\r\ntrembling hands tied on her travelling-hat.\r\n\r\n\"Give me your box,\" said Szekuly, \"it will impede your movements.\"\r\n\r\nBut she held it fast, and said: \"No--they are my jewels, now my only\r\nriches.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are afraid to trust them with me?\" asked he, with a bitter\r\nsmile--\"to me, who will die of your treachery!\"\r\n\r\n\"People do not die so easily,\" said she, trying to smile; but her teeth\r\nchattered, as she flew rather than ran down the grand staircase and\r\narrived breathless before the door. The porter opened it in wonder. The\r\nnight-air blew into her face, and revived her courage. Now she might\r\nbreathe freely, for she was--\r\n\r\nBut no! From the dark recesses of the stone portico emerged three\r\nmuffled figures, and one of them laid his rough grasp upon the delicate\r\narm of the countess and dragged her back into the vestibule.\r\n\r\n\"Too late, too late!\" murmured the colonel, passively following, while\r\nhis heart bled for the treacherous woman whom he would have died to\r\nsave.\r\n\r\n\"Countess Arabella Baillou,\" said one of the figures, \"I arrest you in\r\nthe name of the emperor.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked defiance at him. \"Who are you that dare arrest me?\"\r\n\r\nHe took off his hat and bowed derisively. \"I am the director of police,\r\ncountess, very much at your service. Here is my authority for your\r\narrest.\"\r\n\r\nHe would have shown her the emperor's signature, but she dashed away the\r\npaper, and fastening her angry eyes upon Szekuly, who was leaning\r\nagainst a marble pillar, she said:\r\n\r\n\"That is your dear friend, is it? You have been playing the detective,\r\nhave you? Inducing me to fly, that my flight might expose me to\r\nsuspicion!\"\r\n\r\nThe colonel cried out as though he had been wounded. \"By all that is\r\nsacred in heaven, I would have saved you!\" sobbed he.\r\n\r\n\"And for your attempt I am obliged to detain you also, my poor, unhappy\r\nfriend,\" said the director of the police. \"But you will soon be able to\r\nprove your innocence. Let one of these men accompany you home and there\r\nremain under arrest until you hear from me. Now, madame, follow me, if\r\nyou please.\"\r\n\r\n\"Allow me first to speak a word of consolation to my generous\r\nprotector,\" said the countess.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, madame.\"\r\n\r\nArabella bowed her beautiful head and approached Szekuly, who was\r\nscarcely able to stand, so great was his emotion.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel Szekuly,\" said she, in a whisper, \"you lent me fifty thousand\r\nflorins upon some Italian securities of mine. They are all forgeries. I\r\nforged them myself, as well as all the fine letters of introduction with\r\nwhich I befooled the aristocracy of Vienna.\"\r\n\r\nSzekuly stared for one moment at his tormentor, then hastily pressing\r\nhis hand to his heart, he sank with a low sigh upon the marble floor.\r\n\r\nThe countess laughed out loud. \"He has fainted!\" exclaimed she.\r\n\"Contemptible world, wherein men act like women, and women like men!\r\nCome, gentlemen, I am ready to follow you; but my innocence will\r\nspeedily be reestablished, and the emperor, then, will owe me an apology\r\nfor his want of courtesy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLIX.\r\n\r\nTHE POPE'S DEPARTURE.\r\n\r\nThe people of Vienna were enraptured to the last with the visit of the\r\npope. Whenever he appeared, they sank upon their knees, as, with his\r\nbewitching smile, he gave them his benediction. But these accidental\r\nmeetings did not satisfy the zeal of the Viennese: they longed to\r\nreceive a formal and solemn blessing, pronounced in the cathedral from\r\nthe papal throne.\r\n\r\nHigh upon his throne sat the holy father in his pontifical robes, his\r\ntriple crown upon his head, and the diamond cross of his order upon his\r\nbreast. His canopy was of velvet, richly embroidered with gold, and\r\naround him were grouped the princes of the church. But the pope, his\r\nlarge expressive eyes fixed upon the altar, seemed isolated from all\r\necclesiastical pomp, mindful alone of the God whose representative on\r\nearth he was. And when he rose to give the papal benediction, the\r\nhandsome face of Pius Sixth beamed with holy inspiration, while the\r\npeople, filled with love and joy, knelt to receive the blessing which\r\nhad been transmitted to them in uninterrupted succession from the holy\r\nApostles themselves.\r\n\r\nBut however the loving heart of the pope might rejoice at his reception\r\nby the people, there were two men in Vienna who resisted him with all\r\nthe pride of individuality and all the consciousness of their own worth\r\nand consequence.\r\n\r\nThe first of these was the emperor. He had sought continually to remind\r\nthe sovereign pontiff that although the head of Christendom might be his\r\nguest, he, Joseph, was sole lord of his own domains. He had ordered that\r\nall ecclesiastic ordinances, before being printed, should receive the\r\nimperial exequatur. The pope had desired during his stay to issue a bull\r\nin relation to the newly-erected church of St. Michael. The bull had\r\nbeen returned for the signature of the emperor.\r\n\r\nOther humiliations besides this had been endured by the head of the\r\nchurch. Perhaps in the two solemn benedictions which he had given--the\r\nfirst in the palace-court, the second in the cathedral, Pius had hoped\r\nto appear in public with the emperor as his spiritual vassal; but Joseph\r\nwas careful not to allow him this gratification. He had no sooner\r\nlearned that the throne of the pope in the cathedral was being erected\r\nhigher than his own, than he ordered the imperial throne to be removed,\r\nand excused himself from attendance at high mass upon the pretext that\r\nhe was suffering from severe pain in the eyes, and dared not encounter\r\nthe blaze of light. It was an obstinate case of ocular malady, for it\r\nhad already prevented him from appearing in the palace-court, when\r\ndecorum would have exacted of him to walk behind the pope.\r\n\r\nThe other man who had completely ignored the pope's presence in Vienna,\r\nwas Kaunitz. In vain had his visit been expected; he never came; and\r\nfinally the day of the departure of his holiness arrived. He had\r\nreceived the adieus of the nobles and had taken leave of the clergy. At\r\ntwo o'clock he expected the emperor, who was to accompany him as far as\r\nMariabrunn. It was now eleven, and he had, therefore, three hours of\r\nleisure.\r\n\r\nHe rang for his valet and bade him send a messenger to Prince Kaunitz,\r\napprising him that in half an hour the pope would visit him. A few\r\nmoments after this, the door reopened and the papal master of ceremonies\r\nentered the room. Pius received him with a friendly smile. \"I know why\r\nyou are here,\" said he. \"You have heard from Brambilla that I\r\ncontemplate a visit to Prince Kaunitz, and you come to remonstrate with\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I entreat your holiness not to take this step which--\"\r\n\r\n\"Which is beneath the dignity of the head of the church,\" interrupted\r\nPius. \"You can well imagine that I have already said as much to myself.\r\nI know, that in going to visit this proud man, I humble myself. But if\r\nhumility becomes any one of the servants of God, it becomes the\r\nsuccessor of Peter, and I have no right to shrink from personal\r\nhumiliation, when, perchance, it may win something from haughtiness in\r\nfavor of the church of God. Perhaps the advances I make to Kaunitz may\r\nmove his cold heart, and teach him to do unto others as others have done\r\nunto him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if your holiness intends to bestow such an unheard-of honor upon\r\nthe prince, you should at least have given him a day wherein to make\r\nsuitable preparations for your coming.\"\r\n\r\nThe pope smiled. \"Dear friend, I see farther into this man's heart than\r\nyou. I have taken him unawares, precisely because he would gladly have\r\nadded to my humiliations by neglecting the hint which such an\r\nannouncement would have conveyed. It was, therefore, better to forestall\r\nthe slight by making it impossible for him to offer it as a matter of\r\nchoice.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why does your holiness confer upon this disdainful Austrian an\r\nhonor which he is unworthy to receive?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? Because I feel it my duty to leave nothing undone which can be\r\nconducive to the interests and glory of our holy mother, the church. Who\r\nknows but that the Lord may have sent me to convert an erring sinner\r\nfrom his ways? Go, my friend, go, and send my messenger. I must see this\r\nman who, from youth to old age, has defied the Lord of heaven and\r\nearth!\"\r\n\r\nA half an hour later an imperial state carriage was before the palace of\r\nPrince Kaunitz, and the pope, followed by his chaplain, entered its\r\nlofty vestibule.\r\n\r\nThe prince had been diligent, for there, in their richest liveries of\r\nstate, were his whole household, and at the foot of the staircase, over\r\nwhich a rich Turkey carpet had been spread for the occasion, stood the\r\nyoung Countess Clary in full dress, who knelt, and in soft, trembling\r\naccents begged of his holiness a blessing.\r\n\r\nHe laid his hand upon her head, and then extended it that she might\r\npress to her lips the ring of St. Peter. He then raised her, and begged\r\nher to accompany him to the presence of her uncle, the prince.\r\n\r\nAs they walked together from one magnificent apartment to another, the\r\ncountess was apologizing for her uncle who, not having left his room for\r\nsome weeks, was unable to come out to receive his holiness from dread of\r\nencountering the cold air of the halls.\r\n\r\nThe pope bowed, and followed the countess until she stopped before a\r\nclosed door, and said:\r\n\r\n\"In this room, my uncle awaits the gracious visit of your holiness.\"\r\n\r\nThe pope entered, but he was not met on the threshold as he had\r\nanticipated. No, indeed. Far from the door, with the entire length of\r\nthe room between them, close to the chimney where a huge fire was\r\nburning, stood Kaunitz. He was in an undress coat, with his hat upon his\r\nhead, [Footnote: Gross-Hoffinger, iii., p. 38.] and so absorbed in\r\nthought that he was quite unaware of the entrance of his guest, until\r\nthe Countess Clary, in a loud voice, said:\r\n\r\n\"His holiness the pope.\"\r\n\r\nKaunitz moved, and measuring his advance by that of Pius, he managed to\r\nmeet him just half way, and, as he bowed, he at last condescended to\r\ntake off his hat.\r\n\r\nPius returned the bow, and, as is customary with all independent\r\nprinces, extended his hand to be kissed.\r\n\r\nKaunitz, with an assurance almost inconceivable, took it within his own,\r\nand giving it a hard shake, after the English fashion, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"De tout mon coeur! de tout mon coeur!\" [Footnote: Historical.--See\r\nGross-Hoffinger, iii., p. 39.]\r\n\r\nAt this familiarity an expression of pain flitted over the handsome,\r\nnoble features of the pope, and the smile died upon his lips. But he had\r\nexpected humiliation, and had armed himself to endure it.\r\n\r\n\"I have come to visit your highness,\" said he, mildly, \"because,\r\nalthough you have not asked it, I would fain leave with you the blessing\r\nof the church.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank your holiness for the consideration you are pleased to show\r\nme,\" replied Kaunitz. \"But before all things let me request your\r\npermission to resume my hat. The cold air is injurious to my weak head.\"\r\n[Footnote: The prince's own words.--See Bourgoing, \"Pius VI. and his\r\nPontificate,\" p. 225.]\r\n\r\nAnd whether to ward off the cold air or the blessing of the church, the\r\nold sinner replaced his hat without waiting to hear the pope's reply.\r\n\r\nPius could only affect not to perceive the rudeness, while he seated\r\nhimself, and invited the prince to be seated also. There was a pause.\r\nKaunitz took the chair, and then looking full into the eyes of his\r\nguest, awaited with perfect indifference the opening of the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nThe expression of pain deepened upon the face of the pope; but again he\r\nrecovered himself, and made a second effort at conciliation.\r\n\r\n\"I have come to give to your highness a proof of my esteem and\r\nconsideration,\" said he.\r\n\r\nKaunitz bowed stiffly. \"I am so much the more surprised at this mark of\r\nconsideration, that I have never been able to see in your holiness's\r\nstate-papers the least recognition of my claims to statesmanship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we may have misjudged one another. I have desired, in visiting\r\nVienna, to heal all misunderstandings, and to afford to my son in\r\nChrist, the emperor, every facility for his reconciliation to the holy\r\nchurch. I have also prayed to Almighty God to touch the heart of your\r\nhighness, that you also might turn your steps toward the 'one fold.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope that I have never strayed from the path of right. The object of\r\nmy life has been to make Austria great and independent, and to aid my\r\nemperor in freeing his subjects from foreign dominion. To-day no earthly\r\npotentate has a voice in Austria, save Joseph; he is absolute master\r\nhere, and as all his acts have been for Austria's good, she has entered\r\nat last upon a career of indisputable prosperity. But there is nothing\r\nwonderful in this, when he had me as a coadjutor.\"\r\n\r\nPius looked with profound sadness at this haughty statesman, who had not\r\na thought beyond the present world.\r\n\r\n\"You speak of things that are of the earth, earthy. And yet your hair is\r\nwhite as snow, and you an old man hastening to the grave! At your\r\nadvanced age it would become your highness, who have done so much for\r\nyour sovereign, to do something now to reconcile yourself to your\r\nMaker.\" [Footnote: The pope's own words to Kaunitz.--See \"Pius VI. and\r\nhis Pontificate,\" p. 226.]\r\n\r\nKaunitz grew deathly pale; not all the paint that besmeared his wrinkles\r\ncould conceal his pallor. His forehead contracted, and hung in heavy\r\nfolds, while his breath came fast and gasping. The pope had spoken of\r\nTHE GRAVE, and the vulnerable heel had received a wound.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before he could recover his self-possession--some time\r\nagain before he could force down his fury, and so remain master of the\r\nsituation. At last the victory was won, and he spoke calmly.\r\n\r\n\"I hope,\" said he, \"that having done nothing to offend my Maker, it is\r\nunnecessary for me to seek reconciliation with Him. I have done all that\r\nI could for religion; it is not my fault if her interests are not\r\nidentical with those of the church. But pardon me that I should have\r\nstrayed to themes so unbecoming to my character as host, and yours as my\r\nguest. Let us speak of science, art, life, and its multitudinous\r\nenjoyments. Your holiness, I know, is a distinguished patron of the fine\r\narts. And as you are fond of painting, allow me to offer you a sight of\r\nmy pictures. You will find them quite worth your inspection.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, Kaunitz rose, and, without waiting for the pope's\r\nconsent, stepped as hastily forward as his infirmities would permit, and\r\nopened the door which led to his picture-gallery. The pope followed him\r\nleisurely, and after him came the chaplain, the Countess Clary, and\r\nBaron Binder.\r\n\r\nKaunitz did the honors, passing with visible haste from one painting to\r\nanother. \"Here,\" said he, \"is a masterpiece of Murillo, which the\r\nVatican might envy me--Murillo, who was equally successful, whether he\r\ntried his hand at Virgin or vagabond. Just look at this! Did ever the\r\nearth bestow upon longing man a more voluptuously-beautiful woman than\r\nthis dark-eyed Madonna!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a beautiful picture,\" murmured Pius, approaching with the hope of\r\nbeing spared any more such comments on art.\r\n\r\n\"But your holiness has not the proper light,\" cried Kaunitz, familiarly.\r\n\"Come a little more to the left.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, in the excitement of his enthusiasm, the prince was so forgetful of\r\nthe rank of his visitor as to catch him by the arm, and drag him to the\r\nspot he advised. Pius started, and for one moment his eyes darted fire,\r\nfor, to the very depths of his soul, he felt the indignity; but he\r\nremembered his resolve to \"bear all things,\" and stood quietly\r\ncontemplating the picture until his tormentor spoke again.\r\n\r\nHe, on his part, affected not to perceive that he had done any thing\r\namiss; and with an appearance of great empressement, he followed the pope\r\nfrom picture to picture, dragging him first to one point, then to\r\nanother, as he pretended to think that the best light for seeing his\r\npaintings was to the right or to the left. [Footnote: Bourgoing, \"Pius\r\nVI. and his Pontificate.\" p. 227.]\r\n\r\nThe pope made no resistance, perhaps because he was astounded at the\r\ninsolence of the proceeding, perhaps because he judged it best to affect\r\nunconsciousness of the insults which were being heaped upon his head.\r\nBut he was wounded to the heart, and raised his eyes to his chaplain,\r\nwho, indignant at the contumely offered to his beloved pontiff, at once\r\ncame forward to his relief, by reminding him that the emperor would\r\nshortly visit his rooms.\r\n\r\n\"You are right, my friend,\" said Pius. Then turning to Kaunitz, he\r\ncontinued: \"I must go, and cannot have the pleasure of completing my\r\nsurvey of your paintings. Had I known that you possessed so many\r\ntreasures, I would have come earlier, that I might have been allowed to\r\nvisit them a little more at my leisure. I am under many obligations to\r\nyou for your politeness, and for the very unusual courtesies which I\r\nhave received at your hands.\"\r\n\r\nHe took the arm of his chaplain, and left the room. At the door he was\r\nmet by the Countess Clary, and as she knelt a second time before him, he\r\nlaid his hand upon her head, with a gesture full of nobleness and grace.\r\n\r\n\"I leave you my blessing, my child, and I leave it to all who inhabit\r\nthis house. May those whose hearts have been hardened by sin, return in\r\nhumility to the Lord: for humility is the crown of Christian graces, and\r\nhe who hath it not can never aspire to life eternal.\"\r\n\r\nHe went on without ever turning his head or seeming to know that Kaunitz\r\nwas behind, excusing himself from going farther with his holiness, by\r\nreason of the danger to which he would be exposed, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nAt the portal of the palace the pope was received by his master of\r\nceremonies, who accompanied him to his cabinet. One glance at his pale\r\ncountenance had revealed to him the inutility of the condescension of\r\nthe supreme pontiff, who with a weary sigh sank back into the depths of\r\nan arm-chair.\r\n\r\n\"You were quite right,\" said he, after a pause, \"and I was wrong. I\r\nought never to have gone to this man. God has punished me for my vanity,\r\nand has used him as an instrument to remind me that I am but a poor\r\nmiserable creature, full of projects, but empty of results! Ah,\r\nBattista! with what bright hopes of touching the emperor's heart I\r\nstarted upon this pilgrimage to Vienna, priding myself upon my humility,\r\nand building thereupon my trust! Nothing has come of my\r\nefforts--nothing! I have learned one thing, however, of the emperor. He\r\nis no Christian, but he is not a bad man. I really believe that he acts\r\nfrom a sense of mistaken duty.\"\r\n\r\nThe master of ceremonies shook his head, and was about to reply, when\r\nthere was a knock at the door, and the emperor asked admittance. The\r\nmaster of ceremonies retired to the anteroom, where the suites of the\r\npope and the emperor were awaiting the signal for departure. Joseph\r\napproached his holiness, and gave into his hand a case which he begged\r\nhim to accept as a souvenir of his visit to Austria.\r\n\r\nPius, bewildered by all that he had endured on that day, opened it in\r\nsilence. But he was astonished when he saw the magnificence of he gift.\r\nIt was a large cross of pure, white brilliants, upon a bed of dark\r\ncrimson velvet. [Footnote: This cross was valued at 200,000\r\nflorins.--See Hubner, i., p. 128.]\r\n\r\n\"I beg of your holiness,\" said Joseph, \"to wear this in remembrance of\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nPius raised his head, and looked anxiously into the smiling face of the\r\nemperor. \"Oh, my son,\" said he, \"would this were the only cross I was\r\nforced take back with me to Rome!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your holiness must be content to take with you my love and regard,\"\r\nreplied Joseph, evasively; \"and I would gladly give you another pledge\r\nof them before we part. Will you allow me to bestow upon your nephew,\r\nLuigi Braschi, the title and diploma of a prince?\"\r\n\r\nPius shook his head. \"I thank your majesty; but my nephew cannot accept\r\nthe honor you would confer upon him. It was not to advance the interests\r\nof my family, but the glory of the church, that I came to Vienna.\r\n[Footnote: Pius's own words.--See Gross-Hoffinger, iii., p. 40.] Your\r\nmajesty would make a prince of my nephew, and yet you seek to humble his\r\nuncle, who is the vicar of Christ on earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have I done, your holiness?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have suppressed the order of the Mendicant Friars, and you have\r\ncalled Cardinal Megazzi to account, because he printed one of my bulls\r\nwithout submitting it to you for your approbation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I consider that the Mendicants lead a contemptible life, and we have no\r\nuse for them in Austria. As to the bull, no law is permitted to go forth\r\nin my dominions unless it is approved by me, for the laws of my land\r\nmust be subject to no power but my own.\"\r\n\r\nThe pope heaved a sigh, for it was useless to argue with Joseph. \"Is it\r\nalso true that your majesty has confiscated and sold all the property of\r\nthe convents and churches, and that it is your intention to give\r\nsalaries to the clergy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is my plan; I may as well be frank with you, and avow it. But\r\nI am very far from its accomplishment; I have taken nothing but the\r\nproperty of the convents as yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"And woe to your sacrilegious hand that you have done so!\" cried Pius,\r\nrising to his feet and confronting the emperor. \"I cannot conceal from\r\nyour majesty that your conduct has inflicted a serious wound upon the\r\nchurch, and has scandalized all good Christians. The robbing of the\r\nchurch is an error condemned by ecclesiastic councils, and execrated by\r\nthe fathers of the church. Shall I remind you of the words which John,\r\nthe patriarch of Alexandria, spoke to a sovereign who would have robbed\r\nthe clergy of their temporal goods? 'How canst thou, a perishable\r\nmortal, give unto another that which is not thine own? And when thou\r\ngivest that which belongs to God, thou rebellest against God himself.\r\nWhat man endowed with reason will not pronounce thine act a\r\ntransgression, a signal and sinful injustice? How can a man presume to\r\ncall himself a Christian who desecrates the objects consecrated to\r\nChrist!' Thus has God spoken through the mouth of His servant, and his\r\nwords are appropriate to the acts of your majesty!'\" [Footnote: This\r\nharangue of the pope is historical.--Hubner, i., p. 285.]\r\n\r\nThe voice of the pope was choked by tears, and in the excess of his\r\ngrief he sank back upon the chair and leaned his head upon his hand.\r\n\r\nThe emperor had listened with profound indifference. It was not the\r\nfirst time he had seen the pope thus moved, and he was perfectly aware\r\nthat it was better to make no reply until the violence of his emotion\r\nhad exhausted itself.\r\n\r\n\"Your holiness goes too far in your apostolic zeal,\" said he, after a\r\npause of some length. \"I shall neither quote the Scriptures nor the\r\nFathers in my defence; for you and I would not be apt to interpret them\r\nin the same sense. I shall content myself with observing that, in spite\r\nof all your anger, I shall hearken to the voice of my own conscience,\r\nwhich tells me that my acts are those of a wise lawgiver, and of a\r\nfaithful defender of religion. With this voice, my own reason, and help\r\nfrom above, I am not afraid of being in error. [Footnote: Joseph's own\r\nwords.--Hubner, i., p. 287.] At the same time, I assure your holiness of\r\nmy sincerest regard. You may not have attained the object of your visit,\r\nbut I hope that you carry away at least the conviction of my honesty and\r\nintegrity of purpose. The interests of state and church may be at\r\nvariance, but we need not be personal enemies; and over the gulf which\r\nseparates us as princes, we may join hands as friends, may we not?\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, the emperor extended his hand, and the pope did not\r\nrefuse to take it.\r\n\r\n\"It is time for me to be going,\" replied he. \"This cross, which in the\r\nprodigality of your friendship, you have bestowed upon me, I shall wear\r\nfor your sake, and it shall remind me to pray daily that God may\r\nenlighten you, and lead you back to the Way, the Truth, and the Life.\r\nFor in the church alone is true peace to be found. He who strives\r\nagainst her, strives against Christ. Farewell, and may He mercifully\r\nbring you to a sense of your errors!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLX.\r\n\r\nTHE REPULSE.\r\n\r\nThe aristocracy of Vienna were in a state of extreme excitement. It was\r\nwhispered from one noble to another, that the Aulic Council had\r\ncondemned Count Podstadsky-Liechtenstein for life to the house of\r\ncorrection, and he was to sweep the streets in the garb of a common\r\ncriminal. [Footnote: This was in accordance with the new Josephine\r\ncode.] This was not all. Another fearful announcement had fallen like a\r\nbolt upon the heads of the most illustrious families in Vienna. For some\r\nweeks past, Count Szekuly had been missing. His servants had given out\r\nthat he had gone to visit his relatives in Hungary; but they seemed so\r\nembarrassed and uneasy, that no one believed them. Colonel Szekuly had\r\nmany powerful friends. He was an intimate associate of all the Hungarian\r\nnoblemen in Vienna, and hard long been a welcome guest wherever the\r\nfashionable world had assembled. Moreover, he was the adorer of the most\r\nadmired woman in Vienna, the lovely Countess Baillou.\r\n\r\nShe, too, had disappeared. Where could they be? Was it accident, or had\r\nshe responded to his love, and left a world of worshippers, to live for\r\nhim alone?\r\n\r\nFinally the mystery was solved. A few days after the arrest of\r\nPodstadsky, Szekuly also had been arrested. It was now well known that\r\nPodstadsky had forged notes; but it was impossible to suspect a man of\r\nSzekuly's unimpeachable character of any connection with a crime of that\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, however, though less in degree, the accusation against\r\nSzekuly was similar in kind. He was a defaulter; and from the coffers of\r\nhis regiment (which were confided to his care) sixty thousand florins\r\nhad disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe Countess Baillou was his accuser. She had been charged with being a\r\nparty to Podstadsky's fraud, but he, as well as Szekuly, had loudly\r\ndeclared her innocence. Both had avowed themselves to be her lovers, and\r\nit was ascertained that her household had been maintained at\r\nPodstadsky'a cost. As his mistress, she had received many of his\r\nbank-notes, but he protested that she knew nothing of his forgeries. He\r\nconfessed his own guilt, but firmly upheld her innocence. So far from\r\nbeing his accomplice, Podstadsky declared that she had been his victim.\r\n\r\nBut a coffer containing twenty thousand ducats had been found upon the\r\nperson of the countess. This money had not been given her by Podstadaky,\r\nsince he had nothing but forged notes to give. The countess, when\r\nquestioned, answered unhesitatingly, that one half the sum she had won\r\nat play, and the other half she had received as a present from Colonel\r\nSzekuly. It was well known that Szekuly had not the means of bestowing\r\nsuch princely gifts; yet, when informed of the countess's charge, he had\r\ngrown pale, but replied that the countess had spoken nothing but truth.\r\n\r\nSuspicion was aroused; the strong box of the regiment was examined, and\r\nfound empty! Von Szekuly acknowledged that he had taken the money,\r\nbelieving in good faith that, by the sale of certain deeds in his\r\npossession, he would be able to replace it at short notice. But where\r\nwere these papers? They could not be found, and Szekuly refused to give\r\nany account of them. He was guilty, he said, and must submit to his\r\nfate. Colonel von Szekuly, a Hungarian baron, under sentence for theft!\r\nThis was a blot upon the escutcheon of more than one illustrious family.\r\nBut the emperor, in framing his severe code, had reserved to himself the\r\nright to pardon; and this right, it was hoped, he would exercise in\r\nfavor of the high-born criminals. It was not possible that he intended\r\nto humiliate the nobility of Austria so cruelly as to condemn two of\r\nthem to the pillory, to the sweeping of the streets, to be chained to\r\ntwo common felons for life! [Footnote: Hubner, ii., p. 383]\r\n\r\nNo!--this was an outrage which the emperor would never dare to\r\nperpetrate, for it would arouse the bitter animosity of the whole\r\naristocracy. Still it would be better to petition him at once, and warn\r\nhim of his peril.\r\n\r\nHe was petitioned, but his invariable reply was, that the law must\r\ndecide. It was known, however, that the sentence was not signed, and\r\nthere was still hope. But how to reach the emperor? Since the council\r\nhad pronounced judgment on the criminals, Joseph had granted audience to\r\nno one; he had avoided all proximity to the nobles, and to secure\r\nhimself from importunity, had ceased to ride in the park, contenting\r\nhimself with a daily drive in his cabriolet. Finally the petitioners\r\nremembered the \"Controlorgang,\" and thither they repaired early in the\r\nmorning. Ladies, as well as lords, came on foot, that the emperor might\r\nnot be warned by the sound of their rolling equipages to deny himself\r\nagain. They were the first to enter the palace on that day, and were so\r\nnumerous that no other petitioners could obtain entrance. On that\r\noccasion, then, they were among their peers, and the canaille would\r\nnever know how count and countess, baron and baroness, had humbled\r\nthemselves for the sake of their caste.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Gunther opened the door, they rushed into the small room\r\nwhich was called the Controlorgang, and there, with beating hearts,\r\nawaited the entrance of the all-powerful emperor.\r\n\r\nHe came, and when he saw who were the petitioners of the day, his\r\ncountenance expressed astonishment: but he did not depart from his usual\r\nhabit, and walked slowly down the middle of the room, extending his hand\r\nto receive the petitions.\r\n\r\n\"How?\" said he, when he had reached the last person, \"Count Lampredo,\r\nyou have nothing to present! You all desire to speak with me? I fear\r\nthat my time is too short to gratify you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, we have but one petition to make,\" said the count, speaking for\r\nthe others. \"One common misfortune threatens us all--\"\r\n\r\n\"What can it be\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, your majesty,\" cried he, fervently, \"have mercy upon Count\r\nPodstadsky and Baron von Szekuly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercy, sire, mercy for Podstadsky and Szekuly!\" cried the noble\r\npetitioners with one accord, while all knelt before the astounded\r\nemperor.\r\n\r\nHe surveyed them with an angry frown. \"Rise, all of you,\" said he. \"Have\r\nyou forgotten that kneeling has been abolished here? The Spanish customs\r\nwhich were once so popular in the palace, are unbecoming in this room,\r\nwhere all who enter it are nothing but petitioners seeking justice at my\r\nhands.\"\r\n\r\n\"And mercy, sire!\" added Count Lampredo, imploringly.\r\n\r\n\"And mercy which can be conceded only so far as it is perfectly\r\ncompatible with justice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercy, gracious emperor, mercy for Podstadsky and Szekuly!\" reiterated\r\nthe petitioners.\r\n\r\n\"You ask for mercy which wounds justice, and I repeat that I cannot\r\ngrant the one without the other. Count Podstadsky, through his frauds,\r\nhas ruined thousands of my subjects; Baron von Szekuly has stolen sixty\r\nthousand florins, and both these men have disgraced their births and\r\ntitles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Allow Szekuly to be tried by a military court, sire. They at least\r\nwould shield him from dishonor, for they would sentence him to death.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has committed a vulgar crime and he shall be punished according to\r\nthe burghers' code. That code ignores capital punishment.\"\r\n\r\n\"But its punishments are more fearful than death, sire. A man is thrice\r\ndead who has lost liberty, honor, and name. The man who in manacles\r\nsweeps the public streets, or tugs at the car, is a thousand times more\r\nto be pitied than he who lays his head upon the block. Oh, sire, it\r\ncannot be that you would consign a nobleman to such contumely!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I honor the nobleman too much to brand him with such infamy,\"\r\nreplied the emperor, hastily. \"But if a cavalier commits a crime, I\r\ndisfranchise him at once; and, stripped of name, title, and privileges,\r\nI hand him over to the law which regards him exactly as it does any\r\nother base-born villain. [Footnote: Joseph's own words. See Hubner, ii.,\r\np. 432.] Be comforted, then. These criminals are no longer noblemen, and\r\nhave nothing in common with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sire, do not say so; for their shame is reflected upon us all!\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" exclaimed Joseph, with affected surprise, \"are you all thieves\r\nand forgers?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sire; but our honor suffers through their dishonor. Oh, your\r\nmajesty, in the name of the illustrious families who for centuries have\r\nbeen the loyal subjects of your house, save our escutcheons from this\r\nfoul blot!\"\r\n\r\n\"Save us, sire, save us from infamy!\" echoed the others.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" exclaimed the emperor. \"He who is not ashamed of the crime will\r\nnot be ashamed of the disgrace. If, for the sake of his rank, a man is\r\nto have the privilege of being a villain, where, then, is justice?\r\n[Footnote: Ibid.] Not another word of this! My forbearance is exhausted;\r\nfor I have sought by every means to convince you that, as a sovereign, I\r\nshall show partiality to no order of men. Podstadsky and Szekuly shall\r\nsuffer to the full extent of the law, for the worth of their ancestors\r\ncannot wipe out their own unworthiness.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor withdrew, and when the door closed behind him, many an eye\r\nthere flashed with hatred, and many a compressed lip told of meditated\r\nvengeance for the indignity suffered by a powerful order at his hands\r\nthat day.\r\n\r\n\"Our humiliation, then, has been of no avail!\" muttered Count Lampredo,\r\n\"and the nobles of Austria must suffer disgrace because of the obstinate\r\ncruelty of the man who should uphold them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we will be revenged!\" whispered Count Hojada, a near relative of\r\nSzekuly's. \"The sovereign who, like Joseph, heaps obloquy upon a\r\nnobility, some of whom are his equals in descent, is lost! The emperor\r\nshall remember this hour, and rue it also!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said another, \"he shall repent this day. We are all of one mind,\r\nare we not, friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" muttered they, with gnashing teeth. \"He shall pay dearly for\r\nthis!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLXI.\r\n\r\nTHE COUNT IN THE PILLORY.\r\n\r\nCrowds of people gathered around the street corners to read the large\r\nhand-bills posted there. The bills announced that Count\r\nPodstadsky-Liechtenstein had been condemned to three days of pillory, to\r\npublic sweeping of the streets, and ten years' detention in the house of\r\ncorrection. Colonel von Szekuly to three days of pillory, and four\r\nyears' detention.\r\n\r\nThe guilt of the Countess Baillou not having been fully established, she\r\nwas pardoned by the emperor. But she was ordered to be present at\r\nPodstadsky's exposition in the pillory, and then to leave Vienna\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nThe people read these fearful tidings in dumb amazement and vague\r\napprehension of evil to themselves. Never had they so completely\r\nrealized the new order of things as at this moment. One of the\r\nprivileged, whom they had hitherto beheld at a distance in splendid\r\nequipages, on elegant horses, in brilliant uniforms around the person of\r\nthe emperor, one of these demi-gods was to be trailed in the dust like a\r\ncriminal from the dregs of the populace. A count, in the gray smock of\r\nthe felon, was to sweep the streets, which, perchance, his aristocratic\r\nfoot had never trodden before. A proud Hungarian nobleman, a colonel of\r\nthe guard, was to be exposed in the pillory for three days. These were\r\nterrible and startling events. Not a trace of exultation was upon the\r\ngloomy faces of the multitude: this abasement of two men of illustrious\r\nbirth to an equality with boors, seemed an invasion of the conservative\r\nprinciples of society. It was an ugly dream--the people could not\r\nrealize it. They must go to the spot where the sentence was to be\r\nexecuted, to see if indeed Olympus had been levelled to the earth.\r\nHurried along by one common impulse, the silent multitude wound in a\r\nlong stream through the streets, until they reached the market-place\r\nwhere the sentence was to be carried out. Neither idle curiosity nor\r\nmalice had led the people thither; it was a pilgrimage to the new era\r\nwhich at last was dawning upon the world.\r\n\r\nThere, in the centre of the great open square, was the throne of infamy\r\nupon which an Austrian nobleman was about to bid adieu to name, honor,\r\nfamily, and the associations which had surrounded his boyhood, and to be\r\nthrust into the revolting companionship of robbers and murderers!\r\n\r\nNot a smile was seen upon those appalled faces; men whispered to one\r\nanother that the count was the only son of one of the proudest families\r\nin Hungary; and that the countess, his mother, had died of her son's\r\nshame. The eyes of the women filled with tears, and, for the sake of the\r\nmartyred mother, they forgave the guilty son. The weeping of the women\r\ndeepened the sympathies of the men; and they began to murmur against the\r\nheartless emperor, who degraded an illustrious subject, and sent a noble\r\ncountess broken-hearted to the grave!\r\n\r\nAnd now appeared the criminal. Culprit though he was, his beauty and air\r\nof distinction were indisputable.\r\n\r\n\"Poor young man!\" murmured the women, sobbing.\r\n\r\n\"He will not long survive his disgrace,\" said the men, sorrowfully. \"He\r\nlooks like a ghost, and the emperor will soon have to bury him by the\r\nside of his mother.\"\r\n\r\nNo one remembered that this man had committed an infamous crime; no one\r\nthanked the emperor for having bestowed upon the Austrian people the\r\ninestimable gift of equality before the law. The commoner himself felt\r\naggrieved at the monarch who had treated a nobleman no better than he\r\nwould have done a serf.\r\n\r\nCount Podstadsky was still in the elegant costume of the day. Graceful\r\nand distinguished in his bearing, he leaned his weary body, against the\r\nstake that supported the scaffold on which he was to suffer the last\r\ndegree of public infamy. But now the executioner approached, holding a\r\npair of large glistening shears. He gathered the soft brown curls of the\r\ncount in his rough grasp, and very soon the glossy locks fell, and there\r\nremained nothing but the shorn head of the felon. This done, the\r\nexecutioner drew off the gold-embroidered coat which became the young\r\nnobleman so well, and threw over his shoulders the coarse smock, which,\r\nhenceforth, was to designate him as a miscreant.\r\n\r\nHow changed, alas, was the high-born Carlo! How little this chattering\r\ncreature, disguised in serge, resembled the cavalier who had enlisted\r\nthe sympathy of the multitude! He was no longer a man, and name he had\r\nnone. His number, in scarlet list upon the left sleeve of his smock, was\r\nthe only mark that distinguished him from his brethren--the other\r\nmalefactors. But the fearful toilet was not yet at an end. The feet and\r\nhands were yet to be manacled. As the handcuffs clicked around those\r\ndelicate wrists, the executioner looked up in amazement. Heretofore he\r\nhad been accustomed to hear the jeers and loud mockery of the multitude,\r\nas they applauded the completion of the felon's toilet; but today there\r\nwas not a sound! Nothing to be seen but pale, sorrowful faces--nothing\r\nto be heard but sobs and murmurs of sympathy.\r\n\r\nStill one more torture! The executioner gave him the broom, the baton of\r\nhis disgrace, and he grasped its handle for support. He could scarcely\r\nstand now!\r\n\r\nAt this moment, in fiendish contrast with the behavior of the people, a\r\nloud, mocking laugh was heard. Shudderingly they looked around,\r\nwondering who it was that could add the weight of a sneer to the supreme\r\nmisery which was rending their hearts. It came from above; and every\r\nface, even that of the wretched Podstadsky, as uplifted in horror. He\r\ncaught at the stake, and his vacant eyes rested upon the house whence\r\nthe cruel laugh had issued. There, on a balcony, guarded by several men\r\nin black, stood a beautiful young woman. She it was who had dealt the\r\nblow. In the hour of his agony her rosy lips had mocked him!\r\n\r\n\"Arabella!\" shrieked the despairing man; and with this cry he sank\r\ninsensible to the earth. [Footnote: Count Podstadsky did not long\r\nsurvive his disgrace. His delicate body soon sank under the hardships of\r\nhis terrible existence. One day while sweeping the streets he ruptured a\r\nblood-vessel and died there, with no mourners save his\r\nfellow-criminals.--See Hubner ii., pp. 583-591. \"Characteristic and\r\nHistorical Anecdotes of Joseph II.\" \"Friedel's Letters from Vienna,\"\r\nvol. i., p. 68.]\r\n\r\nWhile all this was transpiring at the market-place, an imperial\r\nstate-carriage had been hurrying through the streets until it stopped\r\nbefore a gloomy house, of which the doors and window-shutters were all\r\nclosed. A footman, in the imperial livery, was seen to ring, and then an\r\nold man in faded black livery opened the door. A few whispered words\r\npassed between them; then a cavalier, in an elegant uniform, sprang from\r\nthe carriage and entered the house. The old butler went before, and\r\nshowed him up the creaking staircase, and through a suite of mouldy\r\nrooms until they reached one with closed doors.\r\n\r\n\"So please your majesty,\" said the old man, \"Count\r\nPodstadsky-Liechtenstein is in there.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor nodded. \"Do not announce me,\" said he, and he knocked at the\r\ndoor. A feeble voice from within responded to the knock, and the emperor\r\nentered without further ceremony. A tall, venerable man in deep mourning\r\ncame forward and looked at him with hollow, staring eyes.\r\n\r\n\"The emperor!\" exclaimed he, recognizing his unexpected guest.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Count Podstadsky, it is I,\" said the emperor, bowing, as he would\r\nhave done before a mighty monarch. \"I come to express my profound regret\r\nfor the great misfortune which has lately befallen you. No man knows\r\nbetter than myself what grief it is to lose a beloved wife. And yours\r\nwas such a noble, such a devoted wife!\" [Footnote: Hubner, ii., p. 391.]\r\n\r\n\"Devoted!\" exclaimed the old count, sadly. \"Alas, sire, there was\r\nsomething on earth which was nearer to her heart than I, else she had\r\nnot died and left me alone. I loved nothing but her, and in losing her I\r\nlose all that made life endurable. I would wish to die now; but I have\r\nstill a principle to defend--the honor of my family.\"\r\n\r\n\"We both have a principle to defend!\" replied the emperor, deeply moved\r\nat the excessive grief of which he was a witness. \"The principle of\r\nhonor and justice--let us both teach the world that justice attacks the\r\nindividual criminal and not his family; and that the honor of a family\r\nrequires that justice should be satisfied. The name of\r\nPodstadsky-Liechtenstein has ever been an illustrious one, and I desire\r\nto prove to you my regard for your race. Give me your hand, count, and\r\nlet us be friends.\"\r\n\r\nHe extended his hand, and with quiet solemnity the old count took it and\r\nlooked up into his sovereign's face.\r\n\r\n\"I thank your majesty,\" said he, after a pause. \"Your conduct toward me\r\nis noble and magnanimous, and I shall be grateful for it to my latest\r\nbreath. You have acted as became a sovereign who has no right to set at\r\ndefiance the laws he has made. Had I been his judge, I should myself\r\nhave condemned the criminal who was once my son, and to-day is the\r\nmurderer of his mother. Years ago I sat in judgment over this\r\ntransgressor and when I did so, I lost my only child. As for the man who\r\nto-day has suffered the penalty of his crimes, I know him no longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"And YOUR honor is unspotted,\" said the emperor. \"Give me your arm,\r\ncount, and let me conduct you to my carriage. It is a lovely day. We\r\nwill take a drive together, and then dine at Schonbrunn. Come--I am\r\nresolved that you shall spend this whole day with me. Give me your arm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" whispered the old man, hesitating and looking gloomily toward\r\nthe window, \"the day is so bright and the sun shines so fiercely, I fear\r\nthat my eyes cannot bear the glare. I beg of you allow me to remain at\r\nhome.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor shook his head. \"Nay, your eyes are not weak. You can bear\r\nthe fullest light of day; you have no need to hide your honored head\r\nfrom the gaze of the world. Take courage, dear friend, and think of what\r\nwe both have said. Have we not our principles to defend? And must we not\r\nboth assert them courageously?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty is right,\" cried the old count. \"I am ready to follow\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nAnd while Carl Podstadsky, awaking from his swoon, looked up into the\r\nface of the malefactor, who from henceforth was to be the companion of\r\nhis sleeping and waking, and the witness of his despair--while one of\r\nalong train of outlawed felons, he dragged his misery through the hot,\r\ndusty streets, his father drove with the emperor to Schonbrunn, and\r\namong all the brilliant guests who dined with him on that day, to none\r\nwas the emperor so deferential in his courtesy as to the old Count\r\nPodstadsky-Liechtenstein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLXII.\r\n\r\nTHE NEMESIS.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile where was the siren who had lured Szekuly to destruction?\r\nWhere was she for whose sake Carl Podstadsky had precipitated himself\r\ninto the waters of obloquy? When the waves had engulfed him, she had\r\ndisappeared, and the last sounds that had rung in his ears were the\r\nsounds of her cruel mirth!\r\n\r\nWas there no punishment in reserve for such atrocity? No punishment for\r\nthis woman without heart, without pity, without remorse? Would no hand\r\nunmask this beautiful fiend?\r\n\r\nThe hand is ready, but it is invisible; and Arabella, in her newfound\r\nsecurity, is dazzled at the magnitude of her own good fortune. \"Whom the\r\ngods wish to destroy they first blind.\" True, she had lost her gold, the\r\nprice of Szekuly's good fame; but she was not poor; her jewels were\r\nworth many such a coffer of ducats. Once in possession of her casket,\r\nshe was again rich, happy, and courted. Not a creature, save Giuseppe,\r\nknew the whereabouts of this precious casket, and with it they must away\r\nto Paris!\r\n\r\nIt was dusk, and Giuseppe, with a travelling carriage, once more awaited\r\nhis mistress at the corner of the street. There remained nothing to do\r\nnow but to remove the coffer from its hiding-place, and that was the\r\nwork of half an hour. Arabella had the key of the little postern, and\r\nthere was no danger of spies, for the house was empty. Having avowed\r\nherself to be the pensioned mistress of Podstadsky, the law had placed\r\nits seal upon her effects, and they were all to be sold for the benefit\r\nof the count's creditors.\r\n\r\nThe night was dark, and the street lanterns were propitiously dim. Here\r\nand there was heard the step of a solitary foot-passenger, and from time\r\nto time the monotonous tramp of the patrol. One of these patrols had\r\njust passed the garden-wall of the hotel, of which the Countess Baillou\r\nhad been the presiding goddess. He looked up at the darkened windows as\r\nhe went, wondered whither the goddess had flown, and walked on. When the\r\necho of his step had died away from the pavement, and the last beams of\r\nthe lantern were flickering out, a dark, slender form emerged from one\r\nof the pillars of the wall, and glided toward the little side-door,\r\nwhich opened on that narrow street. The key was in the door, it clicked\r\nin the lock, and the figure disappeared within. All was quiet.\r\n\r\n\"I am safe,\" thought she; \"not a sound is within hearing. Now for my\r\ntreasures, and away I away from this hateful city forever!\"\r\n\r\n\"Whom the gods would destroy, they first blind.\"\r\n\r\nArabella never suspected that, under cover of darkness, others besides\r\nherself were lurking in that garden; and now as she advanced toward the\r\nhouse, two tall figures approached the postern, and stationed themselves\r\non either side of it.\r\n\r\n\"She is caught,\" whispered one.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied another, \"the bird has come of its own accord into the\r\nnet. We must wait now until we receive further orders.\"\r\n\r\nArabella, meanwhile, looked exultingly at the dark clouds which overhung\r\nthe sky, and almost laughed. \"Thank you, fair moon,\" said she, \"for\r\nwithdrawing your splendor at my behest. Tomorrow you shall shed your\r\nsoft beams upon my flight, for then I shall need your friendly light.\r\nFar away from Vienna, I shall be rich, happy, and free!\"\r\n\r\nNow she was at the servants' entrance. Oh, how the hinges creaked, as\r\nshe opened the door! But what of it? No one was there to hear the sound.\r\nHow foolishly her heart was beating! Now she was inside, and, with\r\nspasmodic haste, she bolted herself within. The darkness was intense.\r\nShe could not see her hand before her, and in spite of herself a cold\r\nchill ran through her frame, and her knees trembled with vague terror.\r\nWhat if, through this black expanse, a hand should suddenly touch hers!\r\nand--\"Oh, how dreadful is this darkness!\" thought she. \"I might die\r\nhere, and no one could come to my help! I feel as I did once before, on\r\nthat night of horror in Italy!\"\r\n\r\nShe shuddered, and, almost swooning with fright, cowered under the\r\nshelter of the marble balustrade, to which she had by this time groped\r\nher way. And now, before her terrified soul, swept phantom after\r\nphantom, all from the miserable spirit-land of the past. Once more she\r\nlived through a night dark as this, when a wretched, betrayed,\r\ndishonored girl, she had slunk through the streets of Rome in search of\r\ndeath--death and annihilation in the black waves of the Tiber. She felt\r\nthe waters engulf her, she heard her own death-cry, the last protest of\r\nyouth against self-destruction; and then she felt the grasp of\r\nPodstadsky--Podstadsky who, in restoring her to the world, had laid a\r\nnew curse upon her life. Until then she had been luxurious, frivolous,\r\npleasure-loving; but in the Tiber she had found a new and terrible\r\nbaptism--the baptism of crime. Without love she had consented to become\r\nPodstadsky's mistress, and so became the partner of his guilt. Together\r\nthey had planned their bold schemes of fraud, and, oh, how successful\r\nthey had been until this last misfortune! At all events, her connection\r\nwith Podstadsky was at an end. The pillory had liberated her, and\r\nnow--now she would lead a blameless life. No more fraud--no more theft.\r\nCrime was too dangerous; she saw that it must inexorably lead to shame.\r\nShe would be satisfied with what she had, and become a virtuous woman.\r\nShe was quite rich enough to be good, and it would be such bliss to live\r\nwithout a guilty secret!\r\n\r\nShe laughed, and then shivered at the sound of her own voice, and a\r\nsupernatural terror took such violent hold of her imagination, that she\r\ncould no longer bear the darkness. She must see, or she would die of\r\nfear. Giuseppe had provided her with a dark lantern, a vial of\r\nphosphorus, and some matches.\r\n\r\n\"How delightful it is to have this new invention!\" thought she, as,\r\ntouching the phosphorus, she struck a light. With this light she felt a\r\nlittle reassured, but could she have seen her blanched, terror-stricken\r\nface, she would have screamed, and fancied it a spectre!\r\n\r\nHush! Was there a muffled sound behind her? She paused and listened, her\r\neyes glaring as though they would start from their sockets. Pshaw! it\r\nwas only the rustling of her own silk mantle as it went trailing up the\r\nmarble staircase. Nothing in human shape was there, save two pale\r\nstatues, which stood like dead sentinels at the head of the stairs. As\r\nshe passed these she shuddered, and almost fancied that they had stepped\r\nfrom their pedestals to follow her. Giving one quick glance behind, she\r\nsped like a hunted doe through those halls, of which so lately she had\r\nbeen the pride, and arrived breathless at the door of her boudoir. She\r\ndarted in, and there, safe in its place, was the picture.\r\n\r\nThis gave her courage. But she must have rest after her fearful\r\npilgrimage through that dark, empty house. She sank upon her satin\r\nlounge, and abandoned herself to the joy and security of the hour. She\r\nhad just come to the end of a perilous journey. Night and danger were\r\nbehind, the rosy morning of safety was about to dawn. She was so full of\r\njoyous emotion, that scarcely knowing what she did, her lips began to\r\nmove in unconscious prayer!\r\n\r\nPrayer! She had no right to such a privilege as that; and starting from\r\nher seat, lest she should falter in the purpose of her visit, she\r\nquickly removed the picture, touched the spring, and the precious coffer\r\nstood revealed.\r\n\r\nNo, no, she could never give it up! She stretched out her arms, and\r\npressed it to her heart, as a mother does her only child. Trembling with\r\neager joy, she placed it on the table, and opening it, contemplated her\r\ntreasures on their beds of crimson velvet.\r\n\r\nHow they sparkled! How they seemed to burn with splendor as the rays of\r\nthe little lantern coquetted with their beauty! She was repaid for all\r\nher terrors, she was happy and secure!\r\n\r\n\"Whom the gods would destroy, they first blind.\"\r\n\r\nShe was so absorbed in the magnificence of her diamond necklace for\r\nwhich she had been indebted to the Princess Garampi, that she did not\r\nhear the footfall of the men who were close behind her. They smiled, and\r\npantomimed one to another as they watched her toying with her flashing\r\njewels.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly springing forward, as if they feared she might escape\r\nthrough the secret opening in the wall, they grasped her with their\r\npowerful hands, and she was once more a prisoner.\r\n\r\n\"The emperor can no longer defend his beautiful countess,\" said the one\r\nwho seemed to direct the others. \"We have caught her in the act of\r\nrobbing Count Podstadsky's creditors. And, unless I am mistaken, we\r\nshall find among her booty all the jewels that were missing at last\r\nwinter's entertainments; for, as I had the honor of reminding his\r\nmajesty, the Countess Baillou was at every ball where jewels were lost.\r\nI told the emperor that if he would give you freedom, I engaged to find\r\nsomething more than a mare's nest when I tracked you hither. I was sure\r\nyou would come, and my spies have been within, waiting for you since\r\nthis morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"What reward was promised by the emperor for my detection?\" said\r\nArabella, now self-possessed.\r\n\r\n\"Five hundred ducats,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Five hundred ducats?\" repeated she, tossing back her beautiful head. \"A\r\nbeggarly reward for the person of a lady of rank like me! Take this\r\nnecklace, and divide it between you. Each one will then have more than\r\nthe frugal emperor has promised to all. Take it and give me my freedom.\r\nYour generous act will never be known.\"\r\n\r\n\"How, lady! You would bribe us, as you have bribed so many noble\r\ncavaliers? No, no. Your game is at an end, and if ever you appear in\r\npublic again, it will be as a criminal. You must come with me. You, men,\r\ntake up this coffer.\"\r\n\r\nShe strove no longer. Without another word she took the arm of the\r\npolice-officer and went firmly forward.\r\n\r\nHer lips moved, and she murmured: \"Alas he is right. My career is at an\r\nend.\" [Footnote: This beautiful woman, \"the ornament of the most elegant\r\ncircles in Vienna,\" as she is called by the chroniclers of the times,\r\nwas condemned to three days of pillory, the same punishment as that\r\nsuffered by the victim of her wickedness and coquetry. She was then sent\r\nguarded to the confines of Austria, from whence she was banished for\r\nlife.--See Hubner, ii., 392. Gross-Hoffinger, iii.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLXIII.\r\n\r\nHORJA AND THE REBELLION IN HUNGARY.\r\n\r\nFour years had gone by since Joseph had reigned sole monarch of Austria.\r\nFor four years he had devoted himself to the Austrians, having but one\r\nobject, that of making them a free, enlightened, and happy people,\r\nemancipating them from the influence of the church, and breaking the\r\nfetters of serfdom; granting them equality before the law, and enriching\r\nthem by his encouragement of manufactures and the privileges he accorded\r\nto merchants.\r\n\r\nWhat was his reward? Dissatisfaction and opposition from every class of\r\nsociety; ingratitude and ill-will from all parties. The nobles disliked\r\nhim because he had sought every opportunity of humbling them before the\r\npeople; the clergy opposed him because of his sequestration of church\r\nproperty, and his assumption of spiritual authority. But his bitterest\r\nenemies were the bureaucratie. He had invaded all their customs,\r\ndischarging every man who had not studied at the university, and\r\nrequiring constant labor from the first as well as the last of the\r\nemployes. He was the terror of all aspirants for civil office, and the\r\nwhole body hated him, embarrassed his steps, and ruined his plans by\r\nvoluntary misconception of all his orders.\r\n\r\nAs yet, there was no outburst of dissatisfaction. The discontent was\r\nlatent, and Joseph still indulged the hope of outliving opposition, and\r\nproving to his subjects that all the innovations which they had so\r\nungratefully endured were for the ultimate good of the Austrian nation.\r\n\r\nHe was therefore ill-prepared for the news which reached him from\r\nHungary. He had freed the people from slavery and taxation, and had\r\nexacted that the nobles should pay their share of the imperial taxes. He\r\nhad instituted a general conscription, and the most powerful Magyar in\r\nHungary was bound to serve, side by side, with the lowest peasant.\r\nFinally he had forbidden the use of any other language in Hungary save\r\nthe German.\r\n\r\nA cry of indignation was heard from every turreted castle in the land.\r\nThey were wounded in the rights hitherto guaranteed to them by every\r\nemperor of Austria. And above all other oppression, they were to be\r\nrobbed of their mother tongue, that they might lose their nationality,\r\nand become a poor Austrian dependency. [Footnote: That was precisely\r\nJoseph's object: and yet he wondered that this people did not love him.]\r\n\r\nBut Joseph's enactments were detested not only by the nobles, they were\r\nequally unwelcome to the people. The latter were horror-stricken by the\r\ngeneral conscription, and fled by thousands to take refuge among the\r\nmountains from the conscribing officers.\r\n\r\nOne of their own class, however, succeeded in drawing them from their\r\nhiding-places. The loud voice of Horja rang throughout every valley, and\r\nascended to every mountain-summit. He called them to liberty and\r\nequality. He asserted that nobility was to be destroyed in Hungary.\r\nThere were to be no more castles, no more magnates of the land. The\r\nemperor had promised as much in Vienna. He had sworn to free the\r\nHungarian peasantry, and to bring the proud noble down to an equality\r\nwith his serf.\r\n\r\nThe hour for fulfilment had arrived. All the new laws regarded the\r\nnobles alone, they had no reference to the peasantry whom the emperor\r\nhad promised to make free, happy, and rich. He needed the help of his\r\nHungarians. They must complete what he had begun. The peasant was to be\r\nfree, happy, rich.\r\n\r\nThis was the magic song which attracted the boor from his thatch under\r\nthe hill, and the goat-herd from his hut amid the mountain-peaks.\r\n\r\nHorja was the Arion who sang--and now to his standard flocked thousands\r\nof deluded beings, all eager to complete the work which the emperor had\r\nbegun. Joseph had made them free--it remained for themselves to plunder\r\nthe nobles, and appropriate their long-hoarded wealth. It was the\r\nemperor's will. He hated the Magyars, and loved the peasantry.\r\n\r\nIf ever any of those poor, ignorant wretches held back, Horja showed\r\nthem a massive gold chain to which the emperor's portrait was attached.\r\nThis had been sent to him by Joseph himself, and in proof thereof he had\r\na parchment full of gilt letters, with a great seal attached to it,\r\nwhich made him Captain-General of Hungary. They could all come and read\r\nthe emperor's own writing if they chose.\r\n\r\nPoor fellows! None of them knew how to read, so that Krischan, a friend\r\nof Horja and a priest of the Greek Church, read it for all who doubted.\r\n\r\nThis brought conviction to the most skeptical. That a Greek priest could\r\nread a lie, never once entered the heads of these simple children of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nNow commenced the carnage. The nobles were imprisoned and murdered,\r\ntheir castles burned, and their fields laid waste. The aristocracy of\r\nthe borders, whose territorial domains the insurgents had not yet\r\nreached, armed themselves, and having captured some of the rebels, put\r\nthem to death under circumstances of exaggerated cruelty, executing them\r\nby the power which the Magyar possessed of administering justice as an\r\nindependent prince.\r\n\r\nThese executions, unsanctioned by the emperor, raised the indignation of\r\nthe people to ungovernable fury, and they now demanded the entire\r\nextinction of the nobles. They were summoned to resign their titles,\r\nand, until the coronation of Joseph, the rightful King of Hungary, they\r\nwere to obey their lawful ruler, Horja.\r\n\r\nThe nobles, not having condescended to take any notice of Horja's\r\nsummons, the people began to pillage and murder with redoubled fury.\r\nThey spared every thing, however, belonging to the emperor--the only\r\nnobleman who, for the future, was to be suffered to own land in Hungary.\r\n\r\nJoseph could no longer turn a deaf ear to the remonstrances of the\r\nMagyars. He had hoped to be able to quell the rebellion by lenity,\r\noffering a general amnesty to all offenders with the exception of Horja,\r\nfor whose capture a reward of three hundred ducats was offered.\r\n\r\nBut the poor, deluded peasantry, having faith in no one but Horja,\r\nthought that the offer of pardon was nothing but an artifice of the\r\nenemy. The emperor, then was obliged to march the imperial troops\r\nagainst the people, and to bring about with musket and cannon what he\r\nhad hoped to accomplish through moral suasion.\r\n\r\nHorja, finding that he had nothing more to hope from the clemency of the\r\nemperor, tried to induce the disaffected nobles to accept his peasantry,\r\nand rebel against Joseph. But they rejected the offer with disdain, and\r\ngave their support to the imperial troops.\r\n\r\nThousands delivered themselves up, imploring mercy, which was granted\r\nthem. Thousands fled to the mountains, and thousands were taken\r\nprisoners. Among these latter were Horja and Krischan. Both were\r\ncondemned to death. Horja pleaded hard to be allowed to see the emperor,\r\nalleging that he had something of importance to communicate to him, but\r\nhis prayer was not granted.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Joseph suspected that Horja would prove to him, what he already\r\ndreaded to know, namely, that the nobles had connived at this\r\ninsurrection of the peasantry to frighten him with the consequences of\r\nhis own acts.\r\n\r\nHorja was not permitted, then, to see his sovereign. He was broken on a\r\nwheel on the market-place at Carlsburg, and two thousand of the cap-bared\r\ninsurgents were forced to witness the cruel spectacle. [Footnote: On the\r\n3d of January, 1785.]\r\n\r\nThus ended this fearful outbreak, by which four thousand men perished,\r\nsixty-two villages and thirty-two castles were consumed; and the deluded\r\npeasantry, instead of freedom, happiness, and wealth, found threefold\r\noppression at the hands of their masters. The magnates and nobles,\r\nmeanwhile, stood upon the ruins of their castles, and cried out:\r\n\r\n\"This is the work of Joseph! These are the fruits of his insensate\r\nreforms!\" [Footnote: Hubner, i., p. 273 Gross-Hoffinger, iii., p. 135.\r\nRamshorn, p. 138.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE JEW'S REVENGE.\r\n\r\nThe emperor paced his cabinet in unusual agitation. Contrary to his\r\ndaily habits, the Controlorgang was closed, and his secretaries had been\r\nordered to remain in the chancery, and do their writing there.\r\n\r\nThe emperor had been weeping; and he wished his anguish to be hidden\r\nfrom any eye save that of God.\r\n\r\nA great sorrow had befallen him. Gunther, his indefatigable co-laborer,\r\nthe trustiest of counsellors, the man whom, next to Lacy and Rosenberg,\r\nhe loved best on earth--Gunther had betrayed him! He had sold a secret\r\nof state for gold!\r\n\r\nThere, before him on the table, lay the reports of the secret police,\r\nwhose duty it was to open all letters passing through the post, and to\r\npresent such as looked suspicious. [Footnote: \"The Emperor Franz and\r\nMetternich: a Fragment.\" (From Hormayer, p. 795)] Among these letters\r\nwas one which strongly inculpated Gunther. It was written by Baron\r\nEskeles Flies to a commercial friend in Amsterdam. It stated that he\r\n(Eskeles Flies) had just received a communication of such vital\r\nimportance that it was worth much more to him than the thousand ducats\r\nhe had paid to his informer. The emperor, tired of his contention with\r\nHolland regarding the navigation of the Scheldt, had agreed to accept\r\nthe ten millions offered by Holland in return for his guaranty that she\r\nshould still preserve her right to demand toll of all ships passing\r\nthrough that portion of the river which was within the Dutch boundaries.\r\n[Footnote: Joseph had claimed from Holland the right to navigate the\r\nScheldt and the canals dug by the Dutch, free of toll. These latter\r\nrefused, and the emperor forth-with marched his troops into Holland. He\r\nhad expected to be sustained by the other maritime powers of Europe, but\r\nthey protecting the Dutch, Joseph was obliged to withdraw his troops.\r\nBut he claimed an indemnity for the expenses incurred by putting his\r\nregiments upon a war-footing, and demanded twenty millions. He then\r\nagreed to take fifteen, but was finally obliged to be content with ten,\r\nwhich was all that the Dutch would allow him. Whereupon Frederick the\r\nGreat said that Joseph had cried out for a great sum, but had been\r\nobliged to come down to a \"pour boire.\"]\r\n\r\nEskeles Flies besought his Amsterdam correspondent to procure him this\r\nloan, which he was ready to advance to the republic in four instalments.\r\nHe bound his friend to strict secrecy, for the information he imparted\r\nwas not to be made public for twenty-four hours, and the possession of\r\nthis secret gave them signal advantage over all other bankers.\r\n\r\nNow Gunther alone had been intrusted by the emperor with this secret of\r\nstate. With the exception of Prince Kaunitz, not another man in Austria\r\nknew that Joseph intended to accept the proffered indemnity.\r\n\r\nIt was clear, then, that Gunther was the traitor, and yet his imperial\r\nmaster would not believe. He clung to the hope that something might yet\r\noccur to exculpate his favorite, though how or whence exoneration was to\r\ncome, he could not conceive.\r\n\r\nThe banker had been summoned, and the emperor awaited his coming. In the\r\nimpatience of his heart he had sent a courier, and after the courier his\r\nown carriage, for he could not endure his suspense one moment longer\r\nthan was unavoidable.\r\n\r\nOften as he paced the room, his heart throbbing violently, he paused to\r\nlisten, and then glanced again and again at the clock to see if the\r\nbanker could be nigh.\r\n\r\n\"If it be true,\" thought he, resuming his agitated walk, \"I never shall\r\ntrust man again. I believed that Gunther's heart was as noble as his\r\nface. Is it possible that such a countenance should lie? Gunther, the\r\ngenerous, disinterested Gunther--can it be that he has sold my secrets?\r\nI cannot, will not believe it. I must see himself, and hear his defence\r\nfrom his own lips.\"\r\n\r\nHurried along by this magnanimous impulse, the emperor approached the\r\ndoor. But he paused, and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"No, no. Conviction must come from testimony, not from assertion. Men\r\nare all actors, and often have I seen how skilfully they wear the mask\r\nof innocence. I have been too often deceived. Ah! there at last is the\r\nbanker.\"\r\n\r\nYes, it was he. The page flung open the door, and announced:\r\n\r\n\"Baron von Eskoles Flies.\"\r\n\r\nThe baron entered the room. He had grown old since Rachel's flight.\r\nScarcely a year had elapsed since then; but in that year her father's\r\nraven locks had become white as snow, and the stalwart man of fifty had\r\ngrown old and feeble.\r\n\r\nThe emperor came forward, and extended his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Look at me, Eskeles,\" said he, in his quick, eager way; \"do not bow so\r\nceremoniously, we have no time to waste on formalities. Look at me, and\r\nlet me see whether you are an honest man scorning falsehood, even though\r\nit might shield a fellow-creature from harm.\"\r\n\r\nThe banker looked the emperor full in the face, and bore the scrutiny of\r\nhis searching eyes without wincing.\r\n\r\n\"I see that you can look me in the face,\" said Joseph. \"You will speak\r\nthe truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Jew is forbidden by his religious code to lie,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nJoseph crossed the room quickly, and taking a letter from his\r\nescritoire, gave it to the banker.\r\n\r\n\"Is this your writing?\"\r\n\r\nEskeles lifted his eyes slowly to the paper, and seemed surprised.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is my writing. I posted this letter yesterday. How, then, do\r\nI find it here? Its detention is a serious inconvenience to me.\"\r\n\r\nHe said this with the demeanor of a merchant whose mind is upon his\r\nbusiness, and who has no idea that it can concern any other person.\r\n\r\n\"The letter was sent to me by the secret police,\" said the emperor. The\r\nbanker looked up in astonishment. \"Ah!\" exclaimed he. \"then the tales\r\nwhich are told of the opening of all our letters by detectives, are not\r\nfables!\"\r\n\r\n\"No--they are not fables, and I am justified in the scrutiny. Men are so\r\ncorrupt that our only defence against treachery is espionage. It is a\r\npity that it should be so; but as long as the people are base, their\r\nsovereigns must stop short of no means to foil them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have never sinned against your majesty. Why, then, is my letter\r\nopen to suspicion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Every man is suspected by the secret police,\" replied Joseph, with a\r\nshrug. \"For that reason they had orders to stop every letter addressed\r\nto Holland. The precaution had been made imperative by our\r\nmisunderstandings with that country. And you see yourself that your\r\nletter betrays a secret of state.\"\r\n\r\n\"Betrays!\" repeated the banker. \"We betray that which we are expected to\r\nbury within the recesses of our own heart. But this news was to go out\r\ninto the world, and was a subject for percentage. I should have made at\r\nleast half a million had my letter not been unluckily detained by your\r\nmajesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not prevent you from earning your percentage,\" replied Joseph,\r\nscornfully. \"Your letter shall go to-day, and my dispatches shall be\r\ndetained until to-morrow. In that way you can still make your half\r\nmillion.\"\r\n\r\nThe banker bowed. \"I thank your majesty for your exceeding\r\ncondescension,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"I will do you this favor, but you must do me a service in return.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not necessary for your majesty to concede me the right to earn\r\nhalf a million, to buy my services,\" said Eskeles, with a slight shade\r\nof reproach. \"I hope that I have always been ready to serve your\r\nmajesty, even when no percentage was to be gained thereby.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I have recognized it, BARON Eskeles Flies. But I do not speak of\r\npecuniary services to-day. I ask a favor of another nature. Tell me,\r\nthen, without reserve, who is the man that receives a thousand ducats\r\nfor revealing a secret of state to you.\"\r\n\r\nThe banker started as if he had received a shot, and glanced inquiringly\r\nat the emperor. \"Was that in the letter?\" asked he.\r\n\r\nJoseph gave it into his hands. Eskeles perused it eagerly, and then,\r\nmurmured in a voice of exceeding contrition, \"Ay, it is there. I was\r\nindiscreet.\" Then, as if overcome by his fault, his head sank upon his\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n\"I await your answer,\" said the emperor. \"Who betrayed me to you for a\r\nthousand ducats?\"\r\n\r\nThe banker raised his head as if making a difficult resolve. \"Your\r\nmajesty, that was an idle boast of mine to enhance the value of my\r\nnews.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mere evasion, baron!\" replied Joseph, angrily. \"Even if you had not\r\nwritten the words in that letter, I should still ask of you, who it is\r\nthat betrays my secrets?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one, sire,\" replied Eskeles, uneasily. \"I guessed it. Yes,\r\nyes,\"--continued he, as though a happy idea had just struck him--\"that\r\nis it--I guessed. Every one knows of your majesty's difficulty with\r\nHolland, and I might well guess that you would be glad to end this\r\nstrife by accepting the ten millions, and so save your subjects from the\r\nhorrors of war.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not the truthful man I had supposed. There is no logic in your\r\nlies, Baron Eskeles. You might guess that I would accept the ten\r\nmillions, but as you are not omniscient, you could not say positively\r\nthat I had written my dispatches yesterday, and would sign them to-day.\r\nYour inventions are clumsy, baron, and I must say that they do you\r\nhonor; for they prove that you have little experience in the art of\r\nlying. But the truth I must have, and as your lord and emperor, I\r\ncommand you to speak. For the third time, who betrayed my secrets to\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sire, I swore not to betray him,\" said Eskeles, in a faltering\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"I absolve you from the oath.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the God of Israel cannot absolve me. I cannot speak the name of the\r\nman, but--your majesty can guess it.\"\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a few moments, then raising his head, the emperor saw\r\nthat his face had become deadly pale. In a low, unsteady voice he\r\ncontinued: \"Your majesty knows that I once had a daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"HAD? You have a daughter, baron.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is dead to me,\" murmured Eskeles so inaudibly that the emperor\r\nscarcely heard him. \"She left me a year ago for a man whom she loved\r\nbetter than her father.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she left because you would have married her to a man whom she\r\nhated. Gunther told me so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire. I had no idea that my unhappy child would go to such\r\nextremity. Had she entreated me as she should have done, I would have\r\nyielded; but her lover had hardened her heart against me, and she\r\nabandoned me--not to become the honorable wife of any man, but to lead a\r\nlife of shame and reproach. Rachel is not married, she is the mistress\r\nof that man.\"\r\n\r\n\"This, too, is your fault, baron. You made her swear never to become a\r\nChristian, and by our laws she could not marry him. But he considers her\r\nas his wife. You see that I know all. Gunther, to justify himself,\r\nconfided to me the whole history of his love.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did not tell the truth, sire. My daughter herself is unwilling to\r\nbecome a Christian.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then she is a conscientious Jewess?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sire, she does not attend the synagogue.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is she, then?\" asked the emperor, astonished.\r\n\r\n\"She is a Deist; and precisely because I required of her to profess\r\neither Judaism or Christianity, she fled to that man whom she cannot be\r\nmade to believe is the suitor of her wealth and not of herself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think, then, that Gunther is interested?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it, sire. He offered for a hundred thousand florins to renounce\r\nRachel and deliver her up to me--Here is his letter; your majesty can\r\nsee it.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor took the letter, and read it. \"It is his writing,\" murmured\r\nhe, sorrowfully; \"it is too true.\"\r\n\r\n\"I refused,\" continued Eskeles. \"I would not buy my daughter back. I\r\ntherefore waited to see what would follow.\"\r\n\r\n\"What followed?\"\r\n\r\nThe banker was silent for a moment; then sighing, he said, in low,\r\ntrembling tones: \"Not long after, I received another letter. He said he\r\nwas straitened in means, that Rachel was pampered, and required so many\r\nluxuries that she had exhausted his purse. As I would not listen to his\r\nfirst proposition, he had another to make. I would give him a certain\r\nsum, and he would do me a substantial service.\"\r\n\r\n\"He offered a thousand ducats, did he not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not remember. The sum is stated in the letter. Here it is, your\r\nmajesty.\" And with these words Eskeles drew a paper from his bosom.\r\n\r\n\"It is, it is,\" said the emperor, in a voice of anguish. \"I can no\r\nlonger doubt his treachery.\"\r\n\r\nEskeles Flies returned the paper to his bosom. \"I keep this on my\r\nperson,\" said he, \"because when Rachel returns to me, it will cure her\r\nof her love for such a villain. \"\r\n\r\n\"Gunther, then, received the money?\" said Joseph.\r\n\r\n\"He did, sire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you no longer deny that he was the Judas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty can remember which of your secretaries was charged with\r\nthe copying of your dispatches.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor sighed. \"I know, I know,\" murmured he; \"and yet it pains me\r\nso to believe it, for I have loved him sincerely.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I have loved my daughter,\" returned Eskeles. \"This man stole her\r\nfrom me, and has converted my child into a Deist.\"\r\n\r\n\"She shall be returned to you, and Gunther shall receive the punishment\r\nof his crimes,\" cried Joseph, in a loud and angry voice. \"No mercy for\r\nhim! I shall know how to act as becomes a wronged and outraged\r\nsovereign.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that will not restore my child\" said Eskeles, disconsolately.\r\n\"What good is it to me that this wretch is to suffer? It will not bring\r\nback Rachel. And even if she should be forced to seek my protection,\r\nwhat comfort can I derive from one who is a Deist--a creature who mocks\r\nat religion?\"\r\n\r\n\"She will be obliged to become one thing or the other, if she would\r\nshield herself from the fearful consequences of her skepticism.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is it,\" cried Eskeles, joyfully. \"Your majesty has found the\r\nremedy. Rachel must be threatened with the disgrace of legal punishment,\r\nand then she will repent, and return to her father. Sire, I accuse her\r\nof Deism. I exact that she be brought to judgment.\"\r\n\r\n\"To judgment!\" exclaimed the emperor. \"Do you know the punishment for her\r\noffence?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fifty lashes on the offender's back! But fear will save her. My Rachel\r\nwill never dare avow herself a Deist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not; but I, as a Christian, cannot allow you to force her back\r\nto Judaism.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then try to make a Christian of her, sire--Oh, I beseech you, lend\r\nyourself to my paternal stratagem for her restoration to honor! Act upon\r\nmy accusation; have her imprisoned in her home; and for four weeks, let\r\na priest visit her daily to instruct her in your majesty's faith. Then\r\nlet her decide whether she will become a Christian or remain a Jewess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bethink you that if she should prove contumacious, I cannot rescue her\r\nfrom punishment. If you persist in your accusation, remember that the\r\nlaw must take its course.\"\r\n\r\n\"I persist, and demand investigation.\"\r\n\r\n\"It shall be granted you. And now here is your letter. Post it to-day,\r\nand it will still be twenty-four hours in advance of mine. We must both\r\nperform our duty, you as a merchant, I as a sovereign; and, believe me,\r\nyou shall have revenge for the wrongs, inflicted upon you by the double\r\ntraitor who has betrayed his emperor and his mistress.\"\r\n\r\n\"I care nothing for his punishment,\" repeated Eskeles, wearily; \"all\r\nthat I ask is my daughter.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor gave his hand, and the banker, pressing it to his lips,\r\nbacked out of the cabinet. Joseph looked after him with sympathizing\r\neyes. \"Poor man! Grief has made him old. Sorrow lengthens days to years,\r\nand wrinkles many a brow which time has never touched.\"\r\n\r\nBut without, Baron Eskelies Flies had changed his mien. No longer bowed\r\ndown with grief, he stood triumphantly reviewing the success of his\r\nstrategy.\r\n\r\n\"I am revenged!\" thought he. \"Short-sighted emperor, you do not dream\r\nthat you arc the tool wherewith the Jew has wreaked his vengeance upon\r\nthe Christian! Go on, and ruin your faithful friend! Go on, hot-headed\r\njudge; punish the man who loves you, without giving him a hearing; and\r\nimagine yourself to be administering justice, while you inflict the\r\ngrossest injustice. It is so Christian-like. Follow the instincts of\r\nyour love and hate, your passion or your pleasures, ye children of the\r\nmoment, while the calculating Jew plays upon your credulity!--And now,\r\nGod of my fathers, let the Christian priest but irritate my child with\r\nhis importunities, and she will seek refuge from his persecutions in the\r\nsynagogue!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLXV.\r\n\r\nTHE FAVOR OF PRINCES.\r\n\r\nThe emperor thrust open the door which led from his cabinet to the\r\nchancery. There at the long, green table, immersed in their business,\r\nsat the four imperial secretaries; and next to the arm-chair, which was\r\nsurmounted by the Austrian crown, sat the unconscious Gunther. Had\r\nGunther seen the look with which Joseph regarded him as he sat quietly\r\nwriting, his heart would have grown chill with apprehension. But not an\r\neye there was raised. One of the emperor's most stringent orders forbade\r\nthe secretaries, when in the chancery, to raise their heads on any\r\naccount. They were to take no note of the entrance of Joseph himself;\r\nthey were co-workers, and no time was to be wasted in ceremonial.\r\n\r\nJoseph seated himself in silence, and taking up a pen, wrote a few hasty\r\nlines upon a sheet of paper. He then rang, and delivered the paper to a\r\npage.\r\n\r\n\"Take this to the colonel commanding the recruits,\" said he, and his\r\nvoice trembled as he spoke these few words. There was a long silence;\r\nthe secretaries continued to write, and Gunther, always obedient to\r\norders, had not once raised his head. His countenance was as tranquil as\r\nit had ever been. \"Gunther.\" said the emperor, in an imperious tone,\r\n\"begin a new sheet, and write what I shall dictate.\"\r\n\r\nGunther bowed, and prepared to obey. The others went on with their work.\r\nHad Joseph not been so blinded by indignation against his private\r\nsecretary, he might have seen how one of the others raised his head and\r\nglanced furtively around; how his face was pale, and his lips were\r\ntwitching; and how his hand was so tremulous that he was scarcely able\r\nto hold his pen. No one observed it. The other secretaries were writing;\r\nthe emperor, in his wrath, saw nothing but Gunther.\r\n\r\nAnd now with flashing eyes, he called upon Gunther to write.\r\n\r\n\"To his Eminence, Cardinal Megazzi;\r\n\r\n\"It has come to my knowledge that the absurd sect which originated in\r\nBohemia, is spreading its pernicious tenets even to our capital. A\r\nheart-broken father has this day come before me to accuse his daughter\r\nof Deism. To what extremes the Deists go in their imbecility, is shown\r\nby the fact, that this girl, who has defied Heaven, the laws of her\r\ncountry, and the authority of her father, has left the paternal roof,\r\nand is now living a life of shame with her paramour. She must either\r\nprofess some faith, or be punished as the law directs. To this end, your\r\neminence will commission an intelligent priest to visit and instruct her\r\nin the tenets of Christianity. From this day she is a prisoner in her\r\nown house; but as she is of Jewish birth (and I do not wish to have it\r\nsaid that we have forced her into Christianity), a Jewish rabbi can also\r\nhave daily access to this unhappy infidel. I give to both priests four\r\nweeks to convert her. If, at the end of that time, she continues\r\ncontumacious, she must be punished as the Josephine Code directs, with\r\nfifty lashes.\" [Footnote: Gross-Hoffinger, iii., p. 116.]\r\n\r\nThe emperor had dictated this letter in sharp biting tones, while\r\nGunther, nothing apprehending, had written it. Once only, when the\r\naccused had been designated as a Jewess, his pen faltered, and his\r\nhandsome, noble face was contracted for a moment by pain. But the pang\r\nhad been sympathetic and momentary.\r\n\r\n\"Have you written?\" asked the emperor, striking the table with his\r\nclinched hand.\r\n\r\n\"I have written, sire,\" replied Gunther, in his fine, sonorous voice,\r\nwhose familiar tones, in spite of himself, stirred the innermost depths\r\nof his misguided sovereign's heart.\r\n\r\n\"Now, answer me one question,\" continued Joseph, hoarsely. \"have you\r\never received a thousand ducats from Eskeles Flies?\"\r\n\r\nAgain the head of one of the secretaries was furtively raised, the hands\r\nshook like aspen-leaves, and the eyes gave one rapid glance toward the\r\nside of the table where Gunther sat.\r\n\r\nThe emperor, as before, was too blinded by passion to see any thing save\r\nthe innocent object of his wrath. Gunther was surprised at the tone in\r\nwhich the question had been asked; and seemed at last to be aware that\r\nit was one full of significance. But his reply was prompt and calm.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire, I received that sum yesterday. Not for me, but for a lady\r\nwhose name is well known to your majesty. It was a legacy left by her\r\nmother.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph laughed scornfully. \"Give me the note to the cardinal,\" cried he.\r\nGunther presented it, and having signed it, the emperor gave it into the\r\nhands of the secretary opposite. \"Fold and address the letter,\" said he.\r\n\"But stop--write first the address of the person who presumes to avow\r\nherself a Deist in the face of my laws. Her name is Rachel Eskeles\r\nFlies.\"\r\n\r\nA cry of anguish burst from Gunther's lips, and in his madness he would\r\nhave snatched the horrid missive from the secretary's hands. But he\r\nrecollected himself, and turning his blanched face toward the emperor,\r\nhe exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Mercy, gracious sovereign, mercy for my Rachel! You have been wickedly\r\ndeceived.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" cried Joseph, \"I have been wickedly deceived; but he who has dared\r\nto betray me, shall be made to suffer for his crime. Rise from this\r\ntable and leave this room. You are dismissed from my service as a false\r\ntraitor!\"\r\n\r\n\"What, your majesty!\" cried Gunther, in tones that were proud and\r\ndefiant. \"You defame me without so much as telling me of what I am\r\naccused! without allowing me the right of justification Tell me--what\r\nhave I done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ask your own conscience, if you have one, and find an answer there!\"\r\ncried Joseph, furious at the lofty bearing of his victim.\r\n\r\n\"If your majesty refuses me that poor boon,\" continued Gunther, \"I\r\nappeal to the laws. My legal judges will be bound to hear me publicly\r\naccused, and to listen to my defence!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am your accuser and your judge--your only judge,\" replied Joseph,\r\nwith concentrated passion. \"I have already found you guilty, and have\r\nalready sentenced you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why, why?\" cried Gunther. \"If you would not drive me mad, tell me\r\nwhy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall do nothing but carry out your sentence,\" cried Joseph ringing a\r\nbell. \"Are the men without?\" said he to the page who answered his\r\nsummons.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty. A subaltern of the third regiment is without, with\r\nfour soldiers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Show them in!\" The page opened the door, and the men entered.\r\n\r\n\"You march to Hungary to your new garrison to-day, do you not?\" said the\r\nemperor.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire--we march in one hour,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Take this man with you as a recruit.\"\r\n\r\nGunther started forward, and with an exclamation of horror fell at the\r\nemperor's feet. \"Mercy! mercy!\" gasped he.\r\n\r\n\"No mercy, but justice for all men!\" cried Joseph, stamping his foot.\r\nThen motioning to the soldiers, he said: \"Take him away and watch him\r\nclosely, lest he escape. Equip him and put him in the ranks. Away with\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\nThe men advanced, and Gunther, seeing that any further appeal was vain,\r\nsuffered himself to be led away in silence. The door closed behind them,\r\nand the emperor was alone with his three secretaries. There was a long,\r\nfearful pause, through which the retreating steps of the soldiers and\r\ntheir victim were heard. When the echoes had died away, the emperor\r\nspoke in hard, cold tones:\r\n\r\n\"Gunther was a traitor, who betrayed the secrets of the state for gold.\r\nI discovered his treachery, and have punished him accordingly. Take\r\nwarning by his fate!\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he passed into his cabinet, and once more gave vent to his\r\nbitter grief.\r\n\r\n\"I could not do otherwise,\" thought he. \"I, who would not spare\r\nPodstadsky and Szekuly, could not spare this traitor, though he has been\r\nvery dear to me indeed. He must suffer, but I shall suffer with him.\r\nMercy is so much more natural to man than justice! Still, mercy is the\r\nprerogative of Heaven alone. I am here to be equitable to all.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour later the third regiment left Vienna for Szegedin, their new\r\ngarrison. A few wagons followed with the luggage and the sick men who\r\nwere unable to encounter the hardships of that formidable march to\r\nHungary. In one of these wagons lay the new recruit. His eves glared\r\nwith delirium, and his lips were parched with raging fever. For a moment\r\nhe seemed to awake from his dream of madness, for he raised himself a\r\nlittle, and murmured, \"Where am I?\" No one answered him, but a flash of\r\nmemory revealed to him the horrors of his situation, and falling back\r\nwith a shudder, he cried out, \"Rachel, my Rachel!\" and then relapsed\r\ninto delirium.\r\n\r\nThe same evening, Baron Eskeles Flies left his hotel on foot, and\r\nhastily traversing the streets, stopped before a house where, ascending\r\nto the second story, he rang the bell. A richly-liveried servant opened\r\nthe door at the head of the staircase.\r\n\r\n\"Is the imperial secretary Warkenhold within?\" asked the baron.\r\n\r\nThe servant did not know--he would see; but the banker saved him the\r\ntrouble by putting him aside, and entering the little vestibule.\r\n\r\n\"Show me the way,\" said he; \"you need not announce me. A rich man is\r\nwelcome everywhere.\"\r\n\r\nThe servant obeyed, and conducted the banker through a suite of\r\napartments whose splendor he contemplated with a sneer. \"Now go,\" said\r\nhe, as the servant pointed to a portiere. \"I shall announce myself.\"\r\n\r\nHe drew the portiere and knocked. Then, without waiting for an answer,\r\nhe entered the room.\r\n\r\n\"Eskeles Flies!\" cried the occupant, who was lounging on a sofa, and was\r\nno other than the secretary that had been so disturbed by the emperor's\r\nwords in the morning. \"Eskeles Flies!\" repeated he, springing from the\r\nsofa, and hastening forward.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Baron Eskeles Flies,\" replied the banker, proudly.\r\n\r\n\"But what brings you to me?\" cried Warkenhold, terrified. \"Your visit\r\nexposes me to danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody knows of my visit, for I came on foot; and let me tell you, Herr\r\nWarkenhold, that my presence in your house is an honor which is not apt\r\nto endanger you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only, to-day, only at this time,\" murmured Warkenhold, apologetically.\r\n\r\n\"Then you should have come to me for your money. You said you were in\r\ngreat want, having lost every thing at cards, and so I hasten to acquit\r\nmyself of my debt. Here is a draft for one thousand ducats.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, for the love of Heaven!\"--whispered Warkenhold.\r\n\r\n\"What can I do with a draft? I never would dare present it for payment,\r\nfor you know that the emperor keeps spies with a hundred eyes to track\r\nhis employes. And suppose I go to your office, I expose myself to\r\ndiscovery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" interrupted the banker, laughing. \"Who should betray you?\r\nNot I. And no one but us two are in the secret. Who, then, should tell\r\nthe emperor that you were hidden behind the door while he dictated his\r\ndispatches, and that you are such a skilful imitator? I swear that\r\nGunther himself would have been staggered had he seen those letters!\r\nThey are capital, and I congratulate you. You are a genius.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great God! must you annoy me with repetition of all that I did?\" cried\r\nthe secretary, with asperity. \"Is it not enough that I am already\r\nwretched, as I look back to the terrible scenes of the morning? I cannot\r\nbanish the image of that unhappy Gunther from my mind. I felt at one\r\ntime as if I must confess and save him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha, ha! did you? Then it was terrible, was it? He thundered like\r\nanother Rhadamanthus, did he, that sapient emperor? And forced poor,\r\ninnocent Gunther to drink of the chalice we had prepared for him? Oh,\r\nrare, far-seeing judge!--Tell me all about it, Warkenhold.\"\r\n\r\nWarkenhold, shuddering, repeated what had taken place. When he spoke of\r\nthe question relating to the thousand ducats, Eskeles Flies interrupted\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"And of course he had to say yes. Gunther is of knightly veracity, and I\r\ninvented the story of the legacy, in anticipation of that question. Oh,\r\nhow admirably my calculations have been made! Let me hear the rest.\"\r\n\r\nWarkenhold went on, and when he had concluded his woful narrative, the\r\nbanker nodded and said:\r\n\r\n\"You are a genius. You narrate as well as you eavesdrop and forge! Upon\r\nmy word, you have entertained as well as you have served me! My success\r\nin this affair is entirely owing to you. You are as skilful as your\r\ngreat Christian ancestor, Judas; but as I hope you are not such a fool\r\nas to go out and hang yourself, here are fifty ducats above our bargain.\r\nThey are for your mistress.\"\r\n\r\nHe drew out his purse and counted the gold.\r\n\r\n\"I thank you,\" said Warkenhold, almost inaudibly. \"I must take the money,\r\nfor I am sorely pressed; but I would give my right hand not to have been\r\nforced to do this thing!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray say the left. Your right hand is a treasure not lightly to be\r\nparted with,\" said the banker, laughing. \"But a truce to sentiment. It\r\nis useless for you to drape yourself in the toga of honor or\r\nbenevolence. Our business is at an end. You have nothing more to claim,\r\nI believe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing whatever; I am--\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the banker taking up his hat, \"we have nothing further to\r\nsay to each other. You have been the instrument of my righteous\r\nvengeance; but as I have an antipathy to villains, let me never see so\r\nmuch as a glance of recognition from you again. From this hour we are\r\nstrangers. Adieu!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE DEPUTATION FROM HUNGARY.\r\n\r\nIn the great reception-room of the imperial palace, a deputation of the\r\nmost illustrious magnates of Hungary awaited an interview with the\r\nemperor. For one whole year the Hungarian nobles had withdrawn from\r\ncourt; but now, in the interest of their fatherland, they stood once\r\nmore within the walls of the palace; and in their magnificent\r\nstate-uniforms, as the representatives of all Hungary, they were\r\nassembled to demand redress for their national grievances.\r\n\r\nWhen the emperor entered the reception-room, he came alone, in a plain\r\nuniform. He greeted the deputies with a smile which they returned by\r\nprofound and silent inclinations of their aristocratic heads. Joseph\r\nlooked slowly around at the brilliant assemblage of magnates before him.\r\n\r\n\"A stately deputation of my loyal Hungarians,\" observed he. \"I see all\r\nthe proudest families of the kingdom represented here to-day. Count\r\nPalfy, for example, the son of him whom the empress was accustomed to\r\ncall her champion and father. Count Batthiany, the heir of my favorite\r\ntutor. I rejoice to see you, and hope that you are here to-day to greet\r\nme as ever, in the character of loyal subjects.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a short pause, after which, Count Palfy, stepping a little in\r\nadvance of the others, addressed the emperor.\r\n\r\n\"Sire, we are sent by the kingdom of Hungary to lay our wrongs before\r\nyour majesty, and request redress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does the count represent your sentiments?\" asked the emperor,\r\naddressing the delegates. A unanimous affirmative was the reply, and\r\nJoseph then continued: \"Speak on. I will hear your complaints and reply\r\nto them.\"\r\n\r\nCount Palfy bowed and resumed. \"We have come to remind your majesty that\r\nwhen, in November, 1780, you ascended the throne of Austria, we received\r\na written declaration from your imperial hand, guaranteeing our rights\r\nunder the national constitution of Hungary. Nevertheless, these rights\r\nhave been invaded, and we come before your majesty's throne in the hope\r\nthat our just remonstrances may not appear offensive in the eyes of our\r\nking.\" [Footnote: These are the words of the Hungarian protest.--See\r\nHubner, ii., p. 265.]\r\n\r\n\"But, what if they do appear offensive?\" cried the emperor, chafed.\"\r\nWhat if I should refuse to hear those complaints which are nothing but\r\nthe fermentation of your own pride and arrogance?\"\r\n\r\n\"If your majesty refuses to hear us to-day,\" said Count Palfy, with\r\nfirmness, \"we shall return to-morrow, and every day; for we have sworn\r\nto present the grievances of the states to your notice, and must keep\r\nour oath.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am quite as well acquainted with the grievances as you, and to prove\r\nit to you, I will state them myself. First, you are aggrieved because I\r\nhave not gone to Hungary to be crowned, and to take the constitutional\r\noath.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire, we are; and this grievance leads us to the second one. We\r\nventure to ask if, secretly and without the consent of the states, the\r\ncrown of St. Stephen has been removed to Vienna?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it has been removed,\" cried Joseph, with increasing irritation.\r\n\"It has been brought to me, to whom it belongs; but I shall return it to\r\nOfen, when the structure which is to receive it is completed.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is an unconstitutional act,\" said Count Palfy. \"Is it not, my\r\nfriends?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" cried a chorus of Magyars.\r\n\r\n\"I have never taken the oath to the constitution,\" was Joseph's reply.\r\n\"Hungary would have to undergo signal changes before I ever go there to\r\nbe crowned as your king. You are not content with reigning over your\r\nvassals; you desire, in your ambitious presumption, to reign over me\r\nalso. But I tell you that I am no royal puppet in the hands of a\r\nrepublic of aristocrats. I am lord and king of all my provinces. Hungary\r\nhas no claim to a separate nationality, and, once for all, I shall no\r\nmore take the coronation oath there, than I shall do it in Tyrol,\r\nBohemia, Galicia, or Lombardy. All your crowns are fused into the\r\nimperial crown of Austria, and it is proper that I, who own them all,\r\nshould preserve them with my regalia at Vienna. All strife and jealousy\r\nbetween the provinces composing my empire must cease. [Footnote: The\r\nEmperor's own words.--\"Letters of Joseph II.\"] Provincial interests\r\nmust disappear before national exigencies. This is all that I have to\r\nsay to the states; but I will say to yourselves, that when I find myself\r\nabsolute lord of Hungary, as well as of Austria, I will go thither to be\r\ncrowned. And now, Lord Chancellor of Hungary, what other grievance have\r\nyou to present?\"\r\n\r\n\"Our second grievance, sire, is, that to the great humiliation of all\r\nHungary, our native tongue and the Latin language have been superseded\r\nby the German. This, too, is unconstitutional, for it has shut out all\r\nHungarians, in a measure, from public office, and has placed the\r\nadministration of our laws in the hands of Austrians, perfectly ignorant\r\nof our constitution.\" [Footnote: The words of the Hungarian\r\nprotest.--Hubner. ii, p. 267]\r\n\r\n\"To this I have to say that German shall be the language of all my\r\nsubjects. Why should you enjoy the privilege of a national language? I\r\nam Emperor of Germany, and any tongue shall be that of my provinces. If\r\nHungary were the most important portion of the empire, its language,\r\ndoubtless, would be Hungarian; but it is not, and, therefore, shall you\r\nspeak German. [Footnote: The emperor's own words.--See \"Letters of\r\nJoseph II.,\" p. 76.] I will now pass on to your third grievance, for you\r\nsee that I am well posted on the subject of your sufferings. I have\r\nnumbered and taxed your property, and that, too, in spite of your\r\nconstitution, which exempts you from taxation. In my opinion, the\r\nprivileges of an aristocracy do not consist in evading their share of\r\nthe national burdens; on the contrary, they should assume it\r\nvoluntarily, and, for the weal of the nation, place themselves on an\r\nequality with the people, each class striving with the other as to who\r\nshall best promote the prosperity of the government. [Footnote: The\r\nemperor's own words.--See \"Letters of Joseph II.,\" p. 76.] I cannot\r\nexempt you, therefore, from paying taxes.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, sire, this tax violates our rights and our constitution,\" replied\r\nCount Palfy.\r\n\r\n\"Has Hungary a Constitution? A tumultuous states-diet, privileged\r\naristocracy, the subjection of three-fifths of the nation to the\r\nremainder--is this a constitution?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the constitution of Hungary, and we have your majesty's written\r\npromise that you would respect it. But even had we received no solemn\r\ndeclaration of the sort, upon the security of our national freedom\r\ndepends the Austrian right of succession to the throne of Hungary.\"\r\n[Footnote: The words of the Hungarian protest.--Hubner, ii., p. 263.]\r\n\r\n\"You dare threaten me?\" cried Joseph, furiously.\r\n\r\n\"No, sire, we do not threaten; we are in the presence of a truth-loving\r\nmonarch, and we are compelled to speak the unvarnished truth. We have\r\nalready borne much from your majesty's ancestors. But, until the death\r\nof Maria Theresa, our fundamental laws remained inviolate. True, in the\r\nlast years of her life she refused to allow the states-diet to assemble;\r\nbut she never laid her hand upon our constitution. She was crowned Queen\r\nof Hungary, and took the coronation oath. Charles the Sixth and Joseph\r\nthe First did likewise. Each one guaranteed us the right of inheritance,\r\nand our national freedom.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no such thing as national freedom in Hungary. It contains\r\nnothing but lords and vassals, and it is vassalage that I intend to\r\nabolish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does your majesty think that the general freedom of the state is\r\npromoted by your conscription laws?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! here we have grievance the fourth,\" exclaimed Joseph.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the conscription is a thorn in your sensitive sides, because it\r\nclaims you as the children and servants of your country, and forces you\r\nto draw your swords in her defence.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have never refused our blood to the country,\" replied Count Palfy,\r\nproudly throwing back his head, \"and if her rights are intact to-day, it\r\nis because we have defended and protected them. We have fought for our\r\nfatherland, however, not as conscripts, but as freemen. Our people are\r\nunanimous in their abhorrence of the conscription act. When we weigh the\r\nmotives and consequences of this act, we can draw but one inference from\r\neither: that we, who were born freemen, are to be reduced to slavery,\r\nand to be trampled under foot by every other province of Austria. Rather\r\nthan submit to such indignity we will lay down our lives, for we are of\r\none mind, and would sooner die than lose our liberty!\"\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" cried Joseph, his eye flashing and his face scarlet with\r\npassion, \"I say to you all, that you shall live, for I, your king and\r\nmaster, command you to do so.\"\r\n\r\nAn angry murmur was heard, and every eye looked defiance at the emperor.\r\n\"Ah,\" said he, scornfully, \"you would ape the Polish diet, and dispute\r\nthe will of your king! You remember how the King of Poland succumbed to\r\ndictation! I am another and a different man, and I care neither for your\r\napprobation nor for your blame. It is my purpose to make Hungary\r\nprosperous, and therefore I have abolished the feudal system which is\r\nunfavorable to the development of the resources of the country. You\r\nMagyars would interfere with me. You have a constitution at variance\r\nwith my laws, and for the sake of a piece of rotten parchment three\r\nhundred years old, Hungary must be suffered to remain uncivilized\r\nforever! Away with your mediaeval privileges and rusty escutcheons! A\r\nnew century has dawned, and not only the nobly born shall see its light,\r\nbut the people who, until now, have been thrust aside by your arrogance!\r\nIf enlightenment violates your ancient privileges, they shall be swept\r\naway to give place to the victorious rights of man! And this is my\r\nanswer to all your grievances. Go home, ye Magyars, assemble your peers,\r\nand tell them that my decision is unalterable; and that what I have done\r\nwith deliberation I shall never revoke. Go home and tell them that the\r\nemperor has spoken, and they have nothing to do but to submit!\"\r\n\r\nWith a slight inclination Joseph turned his back; and before the\r\nmagnates had time to recover themselves and to reply to this haughty\r\nharangue, the emperor had disappeared and closed the door.\r\n\r\nIn speechless indignation they glanced at one another. They had expected\r\ndifficulty; but such insulting rejection of their petition they had not\r\nanticipated. They remembered the day when, with this same Joseph in her\r\narms, Maria Theresa had appealed to their fathers for succor; they\r\nremembered, too, how in the enthusiasm of their loyalty they had sworn\r\nto die for Maria Theresa, their king!\r\n\r\n\"He never revokes!\" muttered Palfy, after a long silence. \"You heard\r\nhim, Magyars, he never revokes! Shall we suffer him to oppress us?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" was the unanimous reply.\r\n\r\n\"So be it,\" said Palfy, solemnly. \"He has thrown down the gauntlet; we\r\nraise it, and strip for the fight. But for Hungary this man had been\r\nruined. To-day he would ruin us, and we cast him off. Henceforth our cry\r\nis--'Moriamur pro rege nostro constitutione!'\"\r\n\r\n\"'Moriamur pro rege nostro constitutione!'\" echoed the Magyars, every\r\nman with his right hand raised to heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE RECOMPENSE.\r\n\r\nFor four weeks Rachel had been a prisoner in her own house; all persons,\r\nwith the exception of a Catholic priest and a Jewish rabbi, having been\r\nrefused access to her. But at the expiration of this time a deputy from\r\nthe imperial chancery was admitted, who had a long interview with the\r\npoor girl, and at dusk another visitor presented himself at the door of\r\nthat gloomy abode. This last one was Baron Eskeles Flies.\r\n\r\nThe sentinels had allowed him to pass, and the guards in Rachel's\r\nanteroom gave way also, for the baron's permit to visit his daughter was\r\nfrom the emperor. With a respectful inclination they presented the key\r\nof the prisoner's room and awaited her father's orders.\r\n\r\n\"Go below, and wait until I call you,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, as we are commanded in the permit to obey you, we follow the\r\nemperor's order.\"\r\n\r\nHerr Eskeles thanked them, and putting a ducat in the hand of each, the\r\nmen departed in a state of supreme satisfaction. They had scarcely left,\r\nwhen the banker bolted the door from the inside, and crossed the room\r\ntoward the opposite door. His hand trembled so that he could not\r\nintroduce the key to open it, and he was obliged to retreat to the sofa,\r\nand there recover himself.\r\n\r\n\"How will she receive me?\" thought he. \"They say that she is sadly\r\nchanged, and that her father would scarcely know his beautiful child\r\nagain. Oh, my child, will I be able to bear the sight of your grief\r\nwithout falling at your feet, and acknowledging my guilt? But pshaw! She\r\nis safe now. I shall take her home; and for every tear that she has\r\nshed, I will give her a diamond bright as a star She shall have gold,\r\npearls, riches, and be once more the envy of all the women in Vienna.\r\nYes, my Rachel, yes--gold, diamonds, and happiness!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned the key, and the door opened. Not a sound greeted his entrance\r\ninto that dismal room, wherein four funeral-looking wax-lights were\r\nburning at each corner of a square table. Even so had the lights burned\r\nin the room where Rachel's mother once lay head. The banker thought of\r\nthis, as between those flaring lights he saw the pale, wan figure on the\r\nsofa, that seemed as rigid, as motionless, and as white as a corpse.\r\n\r\nWas it indeed Rachel? Those pinched features, those hollow eyes; that\r\nfigure, so bowed with sorrow, could that be his peerless daughter? What\r\nhad diamonds and pearls in common with that pale spectre?\r\n\r\nThe banker could scarcely suppress a cry of angwish as he gaze a upon\r\nthe wreck of so much beauty. But he gathered courage to cross the room,\r\nand stood before her.\r\n\r\n\"Rachel,\" said he, in a soft, imploring voice, \"do you know me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you,\" replied she, without moving; \"do you know me?\"\r\n\r\n\"My beloved child, my heart recognizes yon, and calls you to itself.\r\nCome, darling, come and rest within you father's protecting arms. See,\r\nthey are open to receive you. I have forgiven all, and am ready to\r\ndevote my whole life to your happiness.\"\r\n\r\nHe opened his arms, but Rachel did not stir. She looked at him, and when\r\nhe saw the look, his hands dropped nerveless to his side.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Gunther?\" asked she. \"What have you done with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I, my child?\" exclaimed Eskeles. \"The emperor has detected him in some\r\ndishonorable act (I know not what), and has sent him recruit to\r\nHungary.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard this fable before,\" said Rachel, with a glance of mourn.\r\n\"The priest who was sent to convert, has tried to console me for my\r\nloss, by dinning in my ears that Gunther was a traitor; but I know\r\nbetter. He is the victim of a Jew's revenge. It is you who have accused\r\nhim with false witnesses, false letters, with all that vengeance can\r\ninspire, and wicked gold can buy. You are the accuser of my noble\r\nGunther!\" By this time she had arisen, and now she stood confronting her\r\nfather, her wasted finger pointing toward him, and her sunken eyes\r\nglowing like lights from a dark, deep cave. \"Who says so? Who has dared\r\naccuse me?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Your face accuses you!--your eyes, that dare not encounter mine!\r\nNay--do not raise your hand in sacrilegious protest, but answer me. By\r\nthe faith of your ancestors, are you not the man who denounced him?\"\r\n\r\nHe could not meet her scrutinizing glance. He averted his face,\r\nmurmuring: \"He who accused him is no better than himself. But it is the\r\nemperor who condemned him.\"\r\n\r\n\"The emperor is miserably befooled,\" cried Rachel. \"He knows not the\r\nsubtlety of Jewish revenge. But I am of the Jewish race, and I know it.\r\nI know my father, and I know my lover!\"\r\n\r\n\"In this hour of reunion we will not discuss the innocence or guilt of\r\nthe emperor's secretary,\" said the banker, gently. \"I am thankful that\r\nthe dark cloud which has hidden you so long from my sight is lifted, and\r\nthat all is well with us again.\"\r\n\r\n\"All is not well, for between us lies the grave of my happiness, and\r\nthat grave has sundered us forever. I cannot come to you, my father: the\r\nmemory of my lover is between us, and that memory--oh, do not call it a\r\ncloud! 'Tis the golden beam of that sun which has set, but whose rays\r\nare still warm within my breaking heart. I say nothing to you of all\r\nthat I have endured during these four weeks of anguish; but this I can\r\ntell you, my father, that I have never repented my choice. I am\r\nGunther's for life, and for death, which is the birth of immortality!\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a dishonored man!\" said Eskeles, frowning.\r\n\r\n\"And I, too, will be dishonored to-morrow,\" replied Rachel.\r\n\r\nHer father started. He had forgotten the disgrace which threatened her.\r\n\r\n\"Rachel,\" said he, with exceeding tenderness, \"I come to rescue you from\r\nshame and suffering.\"\r\n\r\n\"To rescue me?\" echoed she. \"Whither would you have me fly?\"\r\n\r\n\"To the house of your father, my child.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no father,\" replied she, with a weary sigh. \"My father would\r\nhave forced my heart, as the priest and the rabbi would have forced my\r\nbelief. But I am free in my faith, my love, and my hate; and this\r\nfreedom will sustain me to-morrow throughout the torture and shame of a\r\ndisgraceful punishment.\"\r\n\r\n\"You surely will not brave the lash!\" cried her father, his cheeks\r\nblanched with horror at the thought. \"You will be womanly, my child, and\r\nrecant.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must speak the truth,\" said she, interrupting him. \"The doors of the\r\nsynagogue, as well as those of the church, are closed against me. I am\r\nno Jewess, and you forced me to swear that I would never become a\r\nChristian. But what matters it?\" continued she, kindling with\r\nenthusiasm, \"I believe in God--the God of love and mercy; and to-morrow\r\nI shall see His face!\"\r\n\r\n\"You would destroy yourself!\" cried her father, his senses almost\r\nforsaking him.\r\n\r\n\"No. But do you suppose that I shall survive the severity and\r\nhumiliation of the lash which it is the pleasure of the emperor to\r\ninflict upon me? No, my father, I shall die before the executioner has\r\ntime to strike his second blow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rachel, my Rachel, do not speak such dreadful words!\" cried Eskeles,\r\nwringing his hands in despair. \"You cannot be a Christian, I know it; for\r\ntheir belief is unworthy of a pure soul. How could you ever give the\r\nhand of fellowship to a race who have outlawed you, because you scorn to\r\nutter a falsehood! But confess yourself a Jewess, and all will be well\r\nwith us once more.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall never return to the Jewish God of wrath and revenge! MY God is\r\nall love. I must acknowledge Him before the world, and die for His\r\nsake!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Rachel was calm and resolute; her father almost\r\ndistracted. After a time he spoke again.\r\n\r\n\"So be it, then,\" cried he, raising his hand to heaven. \"Be a Christian.\r\nI absolve you from your oath, and oh, my Rachel! if I sought the world\r\nfor a proof of my overweening love, it could offer nothing to compare\r\nwith this sacrifice. Go, my child, and become a Christian.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \"The Christian's cruelty has cured me of my love for\r\nChristianity. I can never be one of a race who have persecuted my\r\ninnocent lover. As for you, the cause of his martyrdom, hear my\r\ndetermination, and know that it is inflexible. I am resolved to endure\r\nthe punishment; and when the blood streams from my back, and my frantic\r\ncries pierce the air until they reach your palace walls;--when in the\r\nmidst of the gaping populace, my body lies stretched upon the\r\nmarket-place, dishonored by the hand of the executioner,--then shall\r\nyour revenge have returned to you; for the whole world will point at you\r\nas you pass, and say, 'He is the father of the woman who was whipped to\r\ndeath by the hangman!' \"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" sobbed the father, \"I see that you hate me, and yet I must\r\nrescue you, even against your own will. The emperor has given me a pass\r\nto Paris. It is himself who allows me to escape with my poor, misguided\r\nchild. Come, dear Rachel, come, ere it be too late, and in Paris we can\r\nforget our sorrows and begin life anew!\"\r\n\r\n\"No! he has made the law, and he must bear the consequences of his own\r\ncruelty. He need not think to rescue himself from the odium of his acts,\r\nby conniving at my escape! I hate that emperor, the oppressor of my\r\nbeloved; and as he dishonored Gunther, so shall he dishonor me. Our woes\r\nwill cry to Heaven for vengeance, and--\"\r\n\r\nBut Rachel suddenly ceased, and fell hack upon a chair. She had no\r\nstrength to repulse her father, as he raised her in his arms, and laid\r\nher upon the sofa. He looked into her marble face, and put his lips to\r\nhers.\r\n\r\n\"She has swooned,\" cried he in despair. \"We must fly at once. Rachel,\r\nRachel, away! The time is almost up. Come, we must away!\"\r\n\r\nShe opened her eyes, and looked around. \"Come, my daughter,\" said her\r\nfather, kissing her wasted hands.\r\n\r\nShe said nothing, but stared and smiled a vacant smile. Again he took\r\nher hands, and saw that they were hot and dry. Her breath, too, was hot,\r\nand yet her pulse was feeble and fitful.\r\n\r\nHer father, in his agony, dropped on his knees beside the unconscious\r\ngirl. But this was no time for wailing. He rose to his feet again, and\r\ndarting from the room, offered a handful of gold to the sentry, if he\r\nwould but seek a physician. Then he returned to Rachel. She lay still\r\nwith her eyes wide, wide open, while she murmured inaudible words, which\r\nlie vainly strove to understand.\r\n\r\nAt length came the physician. He bent over the patient, examined her\r\npulse, felt her forehead, and then turning to the banker, who stood by\r\nwith his heart throbbing as if it would burst--\r\n\r\n\"Are you a relative of the lady?\" asked he.\r\n\r\n\"I am her father,\" replied Eskeles, and even in this terrible hour he\r\nfelt a thrill of joy as he spoke the words.\r\n\r\n\"I regret, then, to say to you that she is very ill. Her malady is\r\ntyphoid fever, in its most dangerous form. I fear that she will not\r\nrecover: she must have been ill for some weeks, and have concealed her\r\nillness. Has she suffered mentally of late?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I believe that she has,\" faltered the banker. \"Will she die?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid to give you any hope--the disease has gone so far. It is\r\nstrange. Was there no relative near her to see how ill she has been for\r\nso long a time?\"\r\n\r\nGracious Heaven! What torture he inflicted upon the guilty father! At\r\nthat moment he would have recalled Gunther, and welcomed him as a son,\r\ncould his presence have saved the child whom himself had murdered!\r\n\r\n\"Doctor,\" said he, in husky, trembling tones, \"doctor, you must save my\r\nchild. Ask what you will--I am rich, and if you restore her to me, you\r\nshall have a million!\"\r\n\r\n\"Unhappily, life cannot be bought with gold,\" replied the physician.\r\n\"God alone can restore her. We can do naught but assist Nature, and\r\nalleviate her sufferings.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can we alleviate her suffering?\" asked Eskeles humbly, for his\r\nspirit was broken.\r\n\r\n\"By cool drinks, and cold compressions upon her head,\" said the\r\nphysician. \"Are there no women here to serve her?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" murmured the banker. \"My daughter is a prisoner. She is Rachel\r\nEskeles Flies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! The Deist who was to have suffered to-morrow? Poor, poor child,\r\nneither church nor synagogue can avail her now, for God will take her to\r\nhimself.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there is a possibility of saving her, is there not?\" asked the\r\nfather imploringly. \"We must try every thing, for--she must be saved!\"\r\n\"Must?\" repeated the physician. \"Think you because you are rich that you\r\ncan bribe Heaven? See, rather, how impotent your wealth has been to make\r\nyour beautiful child happy (for I know her story). And, now, in spite of\r\nall the gold for which you have sacrificed her, she will die of a broken\r\nheart!\"\r\n\r\nJust then Rachel uttered a loud shriek, and clasping both her hands\r\naround her head, cried out that her brain was on fire.\r\n\r\n\"Cold compressions--quick,\" exclaimed the physician imperatively; and\r\nthe banker staggered into Rachel's dressing-room (the room which Gunther\r\nhad so daintily fitted up), and brought water and a soft fine towel,\r\nwhich his trembling hands could scarcely bind upon his poor child's\r\nhead. Then, as her moaning ceased, and her arms dropped, he passed into\r\nan ecstasy of joy, for now he began to hope that she would be spared to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"We must have female attendance here,\" said the physician.\r\n\r\n\"She must be put to bed and tenderly watched. Go, baron, and bring your\r\nservants. I will see the emperor, and take upon myself the\r\nresponsibility of having infringed his orders. Before such imminent\r\nperil all imprisonment is at an end.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot leave her,\" returned the baron. \"You say she has but a few\r\ndays to live; if so, I cannot spare one second of her life. I entreat of\r\nyou, take my carriage, and in mercy, bring the servants for me. Oh,\r\nlisten! she screams again--doctor go, I entreat! Here--fresh\r\ncompressions--water! Oh, be quick!\"\r\n\r\nAnd again the wretched man bent over his child, and laid the cloths upon\r\nher head. The physician had gone, and he was alone with his treasure. He\r\nfelt it a relief to be able to kiss her hands, to weep aloud, to throw\r\nhimself upon his knees, and pray to the God of Israel to spare his idol!\r\n\r\nThe night went by, the servants came, and the physician, examining his\r\npatient again, promised to return in a few hours. Rachel was carried to\r\nher bed, and, hour after hour, the banker sat patient and watchful,\r\nlistening to every moan, echoing every sigh; afraid to trust his\r\nprecious charge to any one, lest the vigilance of another might fail.\r\n\r\nA day and another night went by, and still no sleep had come over those\r\nglaring eyes. But she wept bitter tears, and when he heard her broken,\r\nmurmured words of anguish, he thought he would go mad!\r\n\r\nBut sometimes in her fever-madness she smiled and was happy. Then she\r\nlaughed aloud, and spoke to her beloved, who was always at her side. She\r\nhad not once pronounced the name of her father; she seemed to have\r\nforgotten him, remembering nothing in all her past life save her love\r\nfor Gunther.\r\n\r\nOften her father knelt beside her, and with tears streaming from his\r\neyes, implored a look, a word--one single word of forgiveness. But\r\nRachel laughed and sang, heedless of the despairing wretch who lay\r\nstricken to the earth at her side; while the lover whom she caressed was\r\nfar away, unconscious of the blessing.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she uttered a wild cry, and starting up, threw her arms\r\nconvulsively about. Now she invoked the vengeance of Heaven upon\r\nGunther's murderers and at last--at last, was heard the name of her\r\nfather! She cursed him!\r\n\r\nWith a cry as piercing as that of the poor maniac, Eskeles Flies sank\r\nupon his knees, and wept aloud.\r\n\r\nGradually Rachel grew more tranquil: and now she lay back on her pillow\r\nwith a happy smile on her lips. But she spoke not a word. Once more she\r\nsighed \"Gunther,\" and then relapsed into silence.\r\n\r\nInto a silence that seemed so breathless and so long, that her father\r\narose, frightened, from his knees. He bent over his smiling child, and\r\nher face seemed transfigured. Not a sigh stirred he, bosom, not a moan\r\nfluttered from her lips. But that smile remained so long unchanged, and\r\nher eyes--surely they were glazed! Yes!--Rachel was dead. [Footnote: The\r\nsad fate of Gunther and of his beloved Rachel is mentioned by Hormayer\r\nin his work, \"The Emperor Francis and Metternich: a Fragment,\" p 78]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE REBELLION IN THE NETHERLANDS.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Joseph was in the Crimea on a visit to the Empress of\r\nRussia. Here he witnessed a great triumph prepared for Catharine by\r\nPotemkin. It was her first greeting at Sebastopol from that navy which\r\nwas to confer upon Russia the dominion of the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nPotemkin invited Catharine and Joseph to dinner served in a pavilion\r\nerected for the occasion. The festivities were interrupted by the clash\r\nof military music; and the Russian empress and the Austrian emperor\r\nstepped out of the pavilion, the fleet, arranged in line of battle, was\r\nbefore them, and greeted them with a salute of a hundred guns. As they\r\nceased, Potemkin turned to Catharine, and cried out in tones of joyful\r\nenthusiasm:\r\n\r\n\"The voice of the cannon proclaims that the Black Sea has found its\r\nmistress, and that ere long the flag of Russia shall wave triumphant\r\nover the towers of Constantinople!\" [Footnote: See \"Conflict for the\r\nPossession of the Black Sea.\"--Theodore Mundt, pp. 253, 255.]\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, Joseph was sailing around the bay of Sebastopol, in\r\ncompany with the empress, Potemkin, and the French ambassador. As they\r\nneared the fleet, Potemkin, pointing out the five-and-twenty\r\nvessels-of-war, exclaimed\r\n\r\n\"These ships await my sovereign's word to spread their sails to the\r\nwind, and steer for Constantinople!\" [Footnote: Ibid.]\r\n\r\nAs Potemkin spoke, Catharine's eyes were turned to the south, where\r\nStamboul still defied her rule, and ambitious aspirations filled her\r\nheart. Joseph, however, looked down upon the foaming waters, and no one\r\nsaw the curl of his lip, as Catharine and Potemkin continued the\r\nsubject, and spoke of the future Greek empire.\r\n\r\nFor Joseph had lost all faith in the brilliant schemes with which\r\nCatharine had dazzled his imagination at St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm with which he had followed her ambitious vagaries, had\r\nlong since died out, and he had awakened from his dreams of greatness.\r\n\r\nAll the pomp and splendor which Potemkin had conjured from the ashes of\r\na conquered country, could not deceive Joseph. Behind the stately\r\nedifices which had sprung up like the palaces of Aladdin, he saw the\r\nruins of a desolated land; in the midst of the cheering multitudes, whom\r\nPotemkin had assembled together to do homage to Catharine, he saw the\r\ngrim-visaged Tartars, whose eyes were glowing with deadly hatred of her\r\nwho had either murdered or driven into exile fifty thousand of their\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he entered with his usual grace and affability into all\r\nCatharine's schemes for the improvement of her new domains. Not far from\r\nSebastopol she proposed to lay the foundations of a new city, and the\r\nemperor was invited to take a part in the ceremonies.\r\n\r\nAmid the booming of cannon, the loud strains of martial music, and the\r\ncheers of her followers, the empress laid the first stone of the city of\r\nCaterinoslaw, and after her, the emperor took up the mortar and trowel,\r\nand laid the second one. He performed his part of the drama with\r\nbecoming solemnity; but, about an hour later, as he was taking his\r\ncustomary afternoon walk with the French ambassador, M. de Sigur, he\r\nlaughed, and said\r\n\r\n\"The empress and I have been working magic to-day; for in the course of\r\na few minutes we built up an entire city. She laid the first stone of\r\nthe place, and I the last.\" [Footnote: Masson, \"Memoires Secretes sur la\r\nRussie,\" vol. i.]\r\n\r\nBut in the very midst of these festivities, a courier arrived with\r\nletters for the emperor from Prince Kaunitz. The prince besought him to\r\nreturn at once, for the discontent which had existed from the\r\ncommencement of his reign in the Netherlands, had kindled into open\r\nrebellion, which threatened the imperial throne itself Joseph took hasty\r\nleave of Catharine, but renewed his promise to sustain and assist her\r\nwhenever she put into execution her designs against Turkey.\r\n\r\nOn the emperor's arrival at Vienna, he found new couriers awaiting him,\r\nwith still more alarming intelligence. The people were frantic, and,\r\nwith the clergy at their head, demanded the restoration of the \"Joyeuse\r\nEntree.\" [Footnote: The \"Joyeuse Entree\" was the old constitution which\r\nPhilip the Good, on his entrance into Brussels, had granted to the\r\nBelgians.]\r\n\r\n\"And all this,\" cried the emperor, \"because I have summoned a\r\nsoap-boiler to Vienna for trial!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty, but the Joyeuse Entree exacts that the people of\r\nBrabant shall be tried in their own country,\" said Prince Kaunitz, with\r\na shrug. \"The Brabantians know every line of their constitution by\r\nheart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they shall learn to know me also by heart,\" returned Joseph, with\r\nirritation. \"Brabant is mine; it is but a province of my empire, and the\r\nBrabantians, like the Hungarians, are nothing but Austrians. The Bishop\r\nof Frankenberg is not lord of Brabant, and I am resolved to enlighten\r\nthis priest-ridden people in spite of their writhings.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, unhappily, the priests in Belgium and Brabant are mightier than\r\nyour majesty,\" returned Kaunitz. \"The Bishop of Frankenberg is the\r\nveritable lord of Brabant, for he controls the minds and hearts of the\r\npeople there, while your majesty can do nothing but command their\r\nungracious obedience. It is the Bishop of Frankenberg who prejudiced the\r\npeople against the imperial seminaries.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can well believe that they are distasteful to a bigot,\" cried Joseph;\r\n\"for the theological course of the priests who are to be educated there\r\nis prescribed by me. I do not intend that the children of Levi shall\r\nmonopolize the minds and hearts of my people any longer. This haughty\r\nprelate shall learn to know that I am his emperor, and that the arm of\r\nthe pope is powerless to shield where I have resolved to strike.\"\r\n\r\n\"If your majesty goes to work in this fashion, instead of crushing the\r\ninfluence of the bishop, you may irretrievably lose your own. Belgium is\r\na dangerous country. The people cherish their abuses as constitutional\r\nrights, and each man regards the whole as his individual property.\"\r\n\r\n\"And because I desire to make them happy and free, they cry out against\r\nme as an innovator who violates these absurd rights. Oh my friend! I\r\nfeel sometimes so exhausted by my struggles with ignorance and\r\nselfishness, that I often think it would be better to leave the stupid\r\nmasses to their fate!\"\r\n\r\n\"They deserve nothing better,\" replied Kaunitz, with his usual phlegm.\r\n\"They are thankless children whom he can win who feeds them with sugar.\r\nYour majesty, perhaps, has not sufficiently conciliated their weakness.\r\nYou have been too honest in your opposition to their rotten privileges.\r\nHad you undermined the Joycuse Entree by degrees, it would have fallen\r\nof itself. But you have attempted to blow it up, and the result is that\r\nthese Belgian children cry out that the temple of liberty is on fire,\r\nand your majesty is the incendiary. Now, had you allowed the soap-boiler\r\nto be tried by the laws of his own land, the first to condemn and punish\r\nhim would have been his own countrymen: but your course of action has\r\ntransformed him into a martyr, and now the Belgians are mourning for him\r\nas a jewel above all price.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot make use of artifice or stratagem. With the banner of Truth in\r\nmy hand, I march forward to the battle of life.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, with your eyes fixed upon that banner, you may fall into the\r\nprecipices which your enemies have dug for you. I have often told your\r\nmajesty that politics can never be successful without stratagem. Let\r\nyour standard be that of Truth, if you will, but when the day looks\r\nunpropitious, fold it up, that fools may rally around it unawares.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you are right,\" sighed the emperor; \"but all this is very sad.\r\nI have meant well by my subjects, but they misinterpret my actions, and\r\naccuse me of tyranny. I go to them with a heart full of love, and they\r\nturn upon the as though I were an enemy. But I will not relent! I must\r\nbe free to act as seems best to myself. The Joyeuse Entree is in my way.\r\n'Tis a gordian knot which must be unloosed before Belgium can be truly\r\nmine; I have no time to untie it--it must be cut in twain!\"\r\n\r\nJust then the door of the chancery opened, and one of the secretaries\r\ncame forward.\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" said he, \"a courier has arrived from Brussels, with dispatches\r\nfrom Count Belgiojoso to his highness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had ordered my dispatches to be sent after me, your majesty,\" paid\r\nKaunitz, taking the papers, and motioning the secretary to withdraw.\r\n\"Does your majesty allow me to read them?\"\r\n\r\n\"By all means. Let us hope that they bring us good news. I gave\r\nstringent orders to Belgiojoso to see that my will was carried out in\r\nBelgium. I bade him inform the people that they should not: have their\r\nprecious soap-boiler back; that he was my subject, and I intended to\r\nhave him tried here. I told him, moreover, that, like all my other\r\nsubjects, the Belgians must pay new taxes without expecting to be\r\nconsulted as to the expediency of the measure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Belgiojoso has obeyed your majesty's commands,\" remarked Kaunitz, who\r\nhad just finished the first dispatch. \"And the consequence is, that the\r\ngood people of Brussels broke his windows for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"They shall pay dear for those windows.\" cried Joseph.\r\n\r\n\"He told them, furthermore, that in spite of the eighth article of their\r\nconstitution, they should pay extraordinary taxes; whereupon they\r\nanswered him with the fifty-ninth article.\"\r\n\r\n\"What says the fifty-ninth article?\"\r\n\r\n\"It says that when the sovereign violates, in any serious way, the\r\nrights guaranteed by the Joyeuse Entree, the people are released from\r\nall obligations toward him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the language of treason!\" cried Joseph.\r\n\r\n\"And treason it is,\" returned Kannitz, folding the second dispatch. \"The\r\npeople collected in the streets, and the burghers, arming themselves,\r\nmarched to the palace of the governor-general, and demanded admittance.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he, what did he do?\"\r\n\r\n\"He received them, sire,\" said Kaunitz, respondingly.\r\n\r\n\"And what said he to the insolent demands of the rebels?--You are\r\nsilent, Kaunitz, and I see in your countenance that you have bad news\r\nfor me. I know my brother-in-law, Albert of Saxony, or rather, I know my\r\nsister Christina. From her youth she has been my enemy, forever crossing\r\nme in every purpose of my life! Christina was sure to prompt him to\r\nsomething in opposition to my wishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would appear that you are right, sire,\" replied Kaunitz.\r\n\r\n\"The burghers exacted of the governor-general that they should be\r\nreinstated in all the rights of the Joyeuse Entree, without exception\r\nwhatsoever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Their Joyeatse Entree is nothing but a mass of impertinent privilege;\r\nwhich Christina herself could not desire to concede,\" cried Joseph. \"I\r\nam curious, then, to know how my brother-in-law crept out of the\r\ndifficulty. What was his answer?\"\r\n\r\n\"He asked time for reflection, sire--twelve hours. It was eleven o'clock\r\nin the morning when the burghers came to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did they go quietly home then?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sire. They surrounded the palace, their numbers continually\r\nincreasing until the place was tilled with armed men, supported by\r\nthousands of insurgents, who rent the air with cries of 'Give us the\r\nJoyeuse Entree! The Joyeuse Entree forever!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Kaunitz, the answer of the Elector of Saxony must have been a\r\ndisgraceful one, or you would not be at such pains to describe the\r\nclamors of the rebellious multitude. Tell me at once what occurred.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, when the twelve hours had expired, the burghers forced the palace\r\ndoors, and two hundred armed men rushed unannounced into the presence of\r\nthe duke.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--well!\" cried Joseph, breathing heavily.\r\n\r\n\"The governor was obliged to yield, and to promise them that their\r\nconstitution should be reinstated.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor uttered a cry of fury, and grew pale with rage. \"He\r\nreinstated the Joyeuse Entree! He presumed to do it! Did I not tell you\r\nthat Christina was my enemy? She it is who has brought this humiliation\r\nupon me! She has dared revoke what I had commanded!--Oh, how those\r\nvulgar rebels must have laughed to see that with their pestiferous\r\nbreath they lead power to blow away my edicts like so many card-houses!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, sire,\" said Kaunitz, with composure. \"There was no jesting\r\namong the people, although they were very happy, and passed the night in\r\nshouts of joy. Brussels was illuminated, and six hundred young men drew\r\nthe carriage of the elector and electress to the theatre, amid cries of\r\n'Long live the emperor! Long live the Joyeuse Entree!'\"\r\n\r\n\"'Long live the emperor!\"' cried Joseph, contemptuously. \"They treat me\r\nas savages do their wooden idols, When they are unpropitious they beat\r\nthem; when otherwise, they set them up and adore them again. Those over\r\nwhom I reign, however, shall see that I am no wooden idol, but a man and\r\na monarch, who draws his sword to avenge an affront from whomsoever\r\nreceived. Blood alone will extinguish the fire; of this rebellion, and\r\nit shall be quenched in the blood of the rebels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Many a throne has been overturned by the wild waves of human blood,\"\r\nsaid Kaunitz thoughtfully; \"and many a well-meaning prince has been\r\nbranded by history as a tyrant, because he would have forced reform upon\r\nnations unprepared to receive it. The insurgent states have some show of\r\njustice on their side; and if your majesty adopts severe measures toward\r\nthem, they will parade themselves before the world as martyrs.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet I alone am the martyr,\" cried Joseph, bitterly--\"the martyr of\r\nliberty and enlightenment. Oh, Kaunitz, how hard it is to be forever\r\nmisunderstood!--to see those whom we love, led astray by the wickedness\r\nof others! I must crush this rebellion by force, and yet the real\r\ncriminals are the clergy.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you think so,\" said Kaunitz, shrewdly, \"then be lenient toward the\r\nmisguided people. Perhaps mildness may prevail. Belgium is united to a\r\nman, and if you enforce your will, you must crush the entire nation.\r\nSuch extreme measures must be resorted to only when all other means\r\nshall have been exhausted.\"\r\n\r\n\"What other means do you counsel?\" asked Joseph, irritated. \"Would you\r\nhave me treat with the rabble?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sire, but treat with the, people. When an entire nation are united,\r\nthey rise to equality with their rulers, and it is no condescension then\r\non the part of the sovereign if he listen to their grievances and\r\ntemporize with the aggrieved. You have not yet tried personal\r\nnegotiations with your Netherlanders, sire. Call a deputation of them to\r\nVienna. We shall thereby gain time, the insurgents will grow more\r\ndispassionate, and perhaps we may reason them into acquiescence. Once\r\nget as far as an armistice with your rebels, and the game is yours; for\r\ninsurgents are poor diplomatists. Let me advise your majesty to\r\ndissimulate your anger, and send conciliatory messages.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" said the emperor, with a deep sigh, \"be it so. I will do\r\nas you like, but I must for ever and ever yield my will to that of\r\nothers. Call a deputation of the provinces, and cite the\r\ngovernor-general and his wife, also to Vienna. I will investigate as a\r\nfather before I condemn as a judge. But if this last proof of my\r\ngoodness should be of no avail, then I shall strike; and if blood flow\r\nin torrents-upon their heads and not mine, be the sin.\" [Footnote:\r\nJoseph's own words. Seo Hubner, ii., p. 454.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE IMPERIAL SUITOR.\r\n\r\nA half year had passed away. The deputation from the Netherlands had\r\nvisited Vienna, and had been deeply impressed with the affability of the\r\nemperor. They returned home, taking with them his assurance that their\r\ntime-honored usages should be respected, and that Joseph himself would be\r\nthe guardian of their ancient rights. He merely desired to free them\r\nfrom \"certain abuses which in the lapse of time had crept into their\r\nconstitution.\" To this end he promised that an imperial delegation\r\nshould visit Brussels to consult with the states.\r\n\r\nThe two envoys publicly sent by the emperor were Count von\r\nTrautmannedorf and General d'Alton. But to these he added a secret envoy\r\nin the person of Count Dietrichstein, the former marshal of Maria\r\nTheresa's household.\r\n\r\n\"I know that my two ambassadors will find a wise mentor in you, count,\"\r\nsaid Joseph as Dietrichstein was taking leave of him. \"I thank you for\r\nsacrificing your pleasant home with its associations to my interest; for\r\nno man so well as you can enlighten public opinion as to my character\r\nand intentions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty knows that not only my comfort but my life are at the\r\ndisposal of my emperor,\" replied the count. \"I deserve no credit for\r\nthis; it comes to me as a proud inheritance from an ancestry who have\r\never been the loyal subjects of the house of Habsburg.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish that I knew how to testify my sense of your loyalty, and to\r\nprove to you that the Hapsburgers have grateful hearts,\" exclaimed the\r\nemperor.\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" said Count Dictrichstein, solemnly, \"it is in your power to do\r\nso. If your majesty really thinks that my family are deserving of it,\r\nyou can confer upon us a very great favor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak, then,\" replied Joseph, eagerly--\" speak, for your wish is\r\nalready granted. I well know that Count Dietrichstein can ask nothing\r\nthat I would not accord!\"\r\n\r\n\"I accept your majesty's kindness,\" said Dietrichstein, in the same\r\nsolemn tone. \"My request is easy of fulfilment, and will give but little\r\ntrouble to my beloved sovereign. It concerns my daughter Therese, whom I\r\nshall leave behind in Vienna.\"\r\n\r\n\"You leave Therese?\" said Joseph, coloring.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your majesty. My daughter remains under the protection of her\r\naunt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Therese is to be left!\" cried the emperor, and an expression of\r\nhappiness flitted over his features.\r\n\r\nCount Dietrichstein saw it, and a cloud passed over his face. \"I leave\r\nher here,\" continued he, \"because the mission with which your majesty\r\nhas intrusted me might possibly become dangerous. Unhappily, however,\r\nfor young girls there is danger everywhere; and for this reason I\r\nscarcely deem the protection of her aunt sufficient.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Count Dietrichstein had been speaking, Joseph had seemed uneasy;\r\nand finally he had walked to the window, where he was now looking out\r\nupon the square. The count was annoyed at this proceeding; he frowned,\r\nand, crossing the room, came directly behind the emperor.\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" said he, in a distinct voice, \"I wish to marry Therese.\"\r\n\r\n\"With whom?\" asked Joseph, without turning.\r\n\r\n\"With your majesty's lord of the bedchamber, Count Kinsky.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Therese?\" asked Joseph, without turning around. \"Does she love the\r\ncount?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sire, she has never encouraged him. She affects to have a\r\nrepugnance to marriage, and has continually urged me to allow her to\r\nenter a convent. But I will not give my consent to such a ridiculous\r\nwhim. Count Kinsky is a man of honor; he loves Therese, and will make\r\nher happy. Therese is the true daughter of my house, sire; a wish of\r\nyour majesty to her would be a law. I therefore beg of you, as the\r\ngreatest favor you could bestow, to urge her to accept Count Kinsky. \"\r\n\r\nThe emperor turned hastily around, and his face was scarlet.\r\n\r\n\"How?\" said he, in a faltering voice. \"You exact of me that I should woo\r\nyour daughter for Count Kinsky?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is this favor, sire, which you have so graciously promised to\r\ngrant.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor made no reply. He gazed at the count with gloomy, searching\r\neyes. The latter met his glance with quiet firmness. A long pause\r\nensued, and the emperor's face changed gradually until it became very\r\npale. He sighed and seemed to awake from a reverie.\r\n\r\n\"Count Dietrichstein,\" said he, in a trembling voice, \"you have pointed\r\nout to me the means of serving you. I will do your behest, and urge your\r\ndaughter to be the wife of Count Kinsky.\"\r\n\r\n\"There spoke my noble emperor!\" cried the count, deeply moved, while he\r\npressed the hand, which had been extended by Joseph, to his lips. \"In\r\nthe name of my ancestors, I thank you, sire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not thank me, my friend,\" said Joseph, sadly. \"You have understood\r\nme, and I you--that is all. When shall I see your daughter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, I leave Vienna this evening, and I would gladly leave Therese an\r\naffianced bride. The marriage can take place on my return.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Joseph, with a smothered sigh, \"I will go at once. Is\r\nthe countess in the city?\" \"No, sire, she is at the villa near\r\nSchonbrunn. But I will send for her, and when she arrives, she shall\r\nhave the honor of an interview with your majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said Joseph, hastily; \"let her remain at the villa, and enjoy\r\none more day of maiden freedom. I myself will drive there to see her. I\r\nshall be obliged to renounce the pleasure of your company thither, for I\r\nknow that you have important business to-day to transact with Prince\r\nKaunitz.\"\r\n\r\nA distrustful look was the reply to this proposition. The emperor\r\ndivined the cause, and went on: \"But if you CANNOT accompany, you can\r\nfollow me with Count Kinsky; that is, if you really think that I can\r\npersuade the countess to accept him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it, sire. Therese will be as docile to the wishes of your\r\nmajesty as her father. As I am ready, at your desire, to renounce the\r\nhappiness of accompanying you to my villa, so she, if you speak the\r\nword, will renounce her foolish fancies, and consent to be Kinsky's\r\nwife.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can try,\" said the emperor, moodily. But he smiled as he gave his\r\nhand to Count Dietrichstein, who, perfectly reassured, went off to his\r\naffairs of state.\r\n\r\nWhen the count had left the room, the expression of Joseph's face\r\nchanged at once. With a deep sigh he threw himself into an arm-chair,\r\nand for some time sat there motionless; but when the little French clock\r\non the mantelpiece struck the hour, he started up, exclaiming: \"Eleven\r\no'clock! Time flies, and my word has been given, Alas, it must be\r\nredeemed!--An emperor has no right to grieve; but oh, how hard it is,\r\nsometimes, to perform one's duty!--Well--it must be:--I am pledged to\r\nfulfil the motto of my escutcheon: 'Virtute et exemplo.'\"\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour later, the emperor was on his way to the villa,\r\nwhich was situated in the midst of a fine park, not far from the palace\r\nof Schounbrunn. Joseph drove himself, accompanied by a jockey, who stood\r\nbehind. The people on the road greeted their sovereign as he passed. He\r\nreturned the greeting, and no one saw how pale and wretched he looked;\r\nfor he, like his mother, was fond of fast driving, and to-day his horse\r\nsped like the wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLXX.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST DREAM OF LOVE.\r\n\r\nTherese von Dietrichstein was alone in the little pavilion which her\r\nfather had built expressly for her. It consisted of a parlor and a\r\nboudoir. The parlor was fitted up without magnificence, but with great\r\nelegance. Herein Therese was accustomed to receive her intimate\r\nassociates. But no one ever entered the boudoir without an express\r\ninvitation; for it was her sanctuary and studio. There the countess was\r\ntransformed into an artist; there she studied music, and painting, in\r\nboth of which she excelled. Her father and her very dear friends knew of\r\nher great proficiency in art, but her reputation went no further, for\r\nTherese was as shy as a gazelle, and as anxious to conceal her talents\r\nas many women are to parade them.\r\n\r\nAt her father's hotel, Therese received the distinguished guests who\r\nvisited there, with the stately courtesy befitting a high-born countess;\r\nbut in her little pavilion she was the simple and enthusiastic child of\r\nart. Her boudoir contained little besides a harp, a harpsichord, and an\r\neasel which stood by the arched window opening into a flower-garden.\r\nNear the easel was a small marble table covered with palettes, brushes,\r\nand crayons. When Therese retired to this boudoir, her maid was\r\naccustomed to keep watch lest she should be surprised by visitors. If\r\nany were announced, Therese came out of her boudoir, and, carefully\r\nclosing the door, awaited her friends in the parlor.\r\n\r\nTo-day she sat in this boudoir, feeling so secure from visitors that she\r\nhad raised the portiere leading to her parlor, and had flung wide the\r\ncasement which opened upon the park. The sweet summer air was fanning\r\nher brow as she sat at the harp, singing a song of her own composition.\r\nShe had just concluded; her little white hands had glided from the\r\nstrings to her lap, and her head rested against the harp, above the\r\npillar of which a golden eagle with outstretched wings seemed to be\r\nkeeping watch over the young girl, as though to shield her from\r\napproaching misfortune.\r\n\r\nWith her head bent over her harp, she sat musing until two tears, which\r\nhad long been gathering in her eyes, fell upon her hands. As she felt\r\nthem, she raised her head. Her dark-blue eyes were full of sorrow, and\r\ntier cheeks were glowing with blushes.\r\n\r\n\"What right have I to weep over a treasure which is as far from me as\r\nheaven is from earth?\" said she. \"I will not repine, so long as I am\r\nfree to dream of him without crime. But what if I should lose that\r\nfreedom? What if my father should wish to force me into marriage? Oh,\r\nthen, I should take refuge behind the friendly portals of a convent!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why take refuge in a convent?\" said a soft voice behind her.\r\n\r\nTherese sprang up with such wild agitation, that the harp, with a clang,\r\nfell back against the wall. Too well she knew this musical voice--it was\r\nthe voice which spoke to her in dreams; and as its tones fell so\r\nsuddenly upon her ear, she felt as if a bolt from heaven had struck her\r\nheart, and knew not whether she would die of ecstasy or fright.\r\n\r\n\"Joseph!\" exclaimed she, all unconscious of the word, and she sank back\r\ninto her chair, not daring to raise her eyes. With one bound the emperor\r\nwas at her side, taking her hands, and pressing them within his own.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, countess,\" said he, tenderly, \"I have startled you. It was\r\nwrong of me to send away your maid, and to present myself unannounced.\r\nIn my selfishness, I would not wait for form, and forgot that my visit\r\nwas totally unexpected. Say that you forgive me; let me read my pardon\r\nin your heavenly eyes. \"\r\n\r\nSlowly Therese raised her head, and tried to speak. She longed to say\r\nthat she had nothing to forgive; but had not the courage to meet the\r\nglances of those eyes which were fixed upon her with an expression of\r\npassionate entreaty, and seemed to be gazing into her heart, reading its\r\nmost cherished, most consecrated secrets.\r\n\r\nDid he understand the language of her agitation? \"Look at me, Therese,\"\r\nwhispered he.\" It is an eternity since we met, and now--one more look\r\nat your angel-face, for I come to bid adieu to it forever.\"\r\n\r\nShe started, repeating his words, \"Bid adieu--adieu!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sweet one, adieu. Some wiseacre has guessed the secret which I had\r\nfondly imagined was known to God and to myself only. And yet, Therese, I\r\nhave never even told myself how passionately I love you! My eyes must\r\nhave betrayed me to others; for since that happy day at Sclionbrunn when\r\nI kissed the rose which had dropped from your hair, you have not been\r\nseen at court. I never should have told you this, my best beloved, but\r\nthe anguish of this hour has wrung the confession from me. It will die\r\naway from your memory like the tones of a strange melody, and be lost in\r\nthe jubilant harmony of your happy married life.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned away that she might not see the tears which had gathered in\r\nhis eyes and were ready to fall. As for Therese, she rose to her feet.\r\nFor one moment, her heart stood still--the next, her blood was coursing\r\nso wildly through her veins that she thought he must surely hear its mad\r\nthrobbings in the stillness of that little room. The emperor turned\r\nagain, and his face was grave, but calm. He had mastered his emotion,\r\nand, ashamed of the weakness of the avowal he had made, he determined to\r\natone for it. He took the hand of the countess and led her to a divan,\r\nwhere he gently drew her down, while she obeyed, as though her will had\r\nsuddenly been merged into his. She was conscious of one thing only. He\r\nwas there!--he whose name was written upon her heart, though she had\r\nnever uttered it until that day!\r\n\r\nHe stood before her with folded arms, and contemplated her as an\r\nenthusiast might look upon the statue of a saint.\r\n\r\n\"Therese,\" said he, after a long silence, \"why did you say that you\r\nwould go into a convent?\"\r\n\r\nTherese grew pale and shivered, but said nothing. Joseph, bending down\r\nand looking into her eyes, repeated his question.\r\n\r\n\"Because my father wishes me to marry a man whom I do not love,\" replied\r\nTherese, with a candor which yielded to the magic of his glance as the\r\nrose gives her heart's sweet perfume to the wooing of the summer breeze.\r\n\r\n\"But, Therese,\" said the emperor, mindful of his promise, \"you must obey\r\nyour father. It is your duty.\"\r\n\r\n\"No--I shall never marry,\" returned Therese, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Marriage is the only vocation fit for a woman,\" replied Joseph. \"The\r\nwife is commanded to follow her husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, to follow the husband of her love,\" interrupted she, with\r\nenthusiasm. \"And oh, it must be heaven on earth to follow the beloved\r\none through joy and sorrow, to feel with his heart, to see with his\r\neyes, to live for his love, or, if God grant such supreme happiness, to\r\ndie for his sake!\"\r\n\r\n\"Therese!\" exclaimed Joseph, passionately, as, gazing upon her inspired\r\ncountenance, he forgot every thing except his love.\r\n\r\nShe blushed, and her eyes sought the floor. \"No,\" said she, as if\r\ncommuning with herself, \"this blessing I shall never know.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not?\" cried he. \"Why should one so young, so beautiful, so\r\ngifted as you, cast away the ties of social life and pass within the\r\njoyless portals of a convent?\"\r\n\r\nTherese said nothing. She sat ashamed, bewildered, entranced; and, in\r\nher confusion, her beauty grew tenfold greater. The emperor's\r\nresolutions were fast melting away.\r\n\r\nAgain he besought her in tender tones. \"Tell me, my Therese; confide in\r\nme, for I swear that your happiness is dearer to me than my life.\" He\r\nbent closer, and seized her hands. His touch was electric, for a tremor\r\ntook possession of them both, and they dared not look at each other.\r\nJoseph recovered himself, and began in low, pleading tones: \"Look at me,\r\nbeloved, and let me read my answer in your truthful eyes. Look at me,\r\nfor those eyes are my light, my life, my heaven!\"\r\n\r\nTherese could not obey. Her head sank lower and lower, and deep,\r\nconvulsive sighs rent her heart. The emperor, scarcely knowing what he\r\ndid, knelt before her. She met his glance of intoxicated love, and,\r\nunable to resist it, murmured:\r\n\r\n\"Because I love--thee.\"\r\n\r\nHad he heard aright? Was it not the trees whispering to the summer air,\r\nor the birds cooing beneath the eaves? Or had an angel borne the message\r\nfrom that heaven which to-day was so radiant and so silver-bright?\r\n\r\nHe still knelt, and pressed her trembling hands to his lips, while his\r\nface was lit up with a joy, which Therese had never seen there before.\r\n\r\n\"Have I found you at last, star of my dark and solitary life?\" said he.\r\n\"Are you mine at last, shy gazelle, that so long have escaped me,\r\nbounding higher and higher up the icy steeps of this cheerless world?\r\nOh, Therese, why did I not find you in the early years of life? And yet\r\nI thank Heaven that you are mine for these few fleeting moments, for\r\nthey have taken me back to the days of my youth and its beautiful\r\nillusions! Ah, Therese, from the first hour when I beheld you advancing\r\non your father's arm to greet me, proud as an empress, calm as a vestal,\r\nbeautiful as Aphrodite, my heart acknowledged you as its mistress! Since\r\nthen I have been your slave, kissing your shadow as it went before me,\r\nand yet riot conscious of my insane passion until your father saw me\r\nwith that rose--and then I knew that I loved you forever! Yes, Therese,\r\nyou are the last love of an unfortunate man, whom the world calls an\r\nemperor, but who lies at your feet, as the beggar before his ideal of\r\nthe glorious Madonna! Bend to me, Madonna, and let me drink my last\r\ndraught of love! I shall soon have quaffed it, and then--your father\r\nwill be here to remind me that you are a high-born countess, the\r\npriceless treasure of whose love I may not possess! Kiss me, my Therese,\r\nand consecrate my lips to holy resignation!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Therese, too bewildered to resist, bent forward. Their lips met, and\r\nhis arms were around her, and time, place, station, honor--every thing\r\nvanished before the might of their love.\r\n\r\nSuddenly they heard an exclamation--and there, at the porture, stood the\r\nfather and the suitor of Therese, their pale and angry faces turned\r\ntoward the lovers.\r\n\r\nThe emperor, burning with shame and fury, sprang to his feet. Therese,\r\nwith a faint cry, hid her face in her hands, and, trembling with fear,\r\nawaited her sentence.\r\n\r\nThere was a deep silence. Each one seemed afraid to speak, for the first\r\nword uttered in that room might be treason. With dark and sullen faces,\r\nthe two noblemen looked at the imperial culprit, who, leaning against\r\nthe window, with head upturned to heaven, seemed scarcely able to\r\nsustain the weight of his own anguish. The stillness was insupportable,\r\nand it was his duty to break it. He glanced at the two men who,\r\nimmovable and frowning, awaited this explanation.\r\n\r\nJoseph turned to Therese, who had not yet withdrawn her hands. She felt\r\nas if she could never face the world again.\r\n\r\n\"Rise, Therese, and give me your hand,\" said he, authoritatively.\r\n\r\nShe obeyed at once, and the emperor, pressing that trembling hand within\r\nhis own, led her to her father.\r\n\r\n\"Count Dietrichstein,\" said he, \"you reminded me to-day of the\r\nlong-tried loyalty of your house, and asked me, as your reward, to\r\nadvise your daughter's acceptance of the husband you have chosen for\r\nher. I have fulfilled my promise, and Therese has consented to obey your\r\ncommands. She promises to renounce her dream of entering a convent, and\r\nto become the wife of Count Kinsky. Is it not so, Therese? Have I not\r\nyour approval in promising these things to your father?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is so,\" murmured Therese, turning pale as death.\r\n\r\n\"And now, Count Dietrichstein,\" continued Joseph, \"I will allow you to\r\npostpone your mission to Brussels, so that before you leave Vienna you\r\nmay witness the nuptials of your daughter. In one week the marriage will\r\nbe solemnized in the imperial chapel. Count Kinsky, I deliver your bride\r\ninto your hands. Farewell! I shall meet you in the chapel.\"\r\n\r\nHe bowed, and hurried away. He heard the cry which broke from the lips\r\nof Therese, although he did not turn his head when her father's voice\r\ncalled loudly for help. But seeing that the countess's maid was walking\r\nin the park, he overtook her, saying, hastily, \"Go quickly to the\r\npavilion; the Countess Therese has fainted.\"\r\n\r\nThen he hastened away, not keeping the walks, but trampling heedlessly\r\nover the flowers, and dashing past the lilacs and laburniuns, thinking\r\nof that fearful hour when Adam was driven from Paradise, and wondering\r\nwhether the agony of the first man who sinned had been greater than his\r\nto-day, when the sun was setting upon the last dream of love which he\r\nwould ever have in this world!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE TURKISH WAR.\r\n\r\nThe bolt had fallen. Russia had declared war against Turkey. On the\r\nreturn of the emperor from his unfortunate pilgrimage to Count\r\nDietrichstein's villa, three couriers awaited him from Petersburg,\r\nConstantinople, and Berlin. Besides various dispatches from Count\r\nCobenzl, the courier from Petersburg brought an autographic letter from\r\nthe empress. Catharine reminded the emperor of the promise which he had\r\nmade in St. Petersburg, and renewed at Cherson, announced that the hour\r\nhad arrived for its fulfilment. The enmity so long smothered under the\r\nashes of simulated peace had kindled and broken out into the flames of\r\nopen war.\r\n\r\nThe Porte himself had broken the peace. On account of some arbitrary act\r\nof the Russian ambassador, he had seized and confined him in the Seven\r\nTowers. Russia had demanded his release, and satisfaction for the\r\ninsult. The sultan had replied by demanding the restoration of the\r\nCrimea, and the withdrawal of the Russian fleet from the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nThe disputants had called in the Austrian internuncio, but all diplomacy\r\nwas vain. Indeed, neither Russia, Turkey, nor Austria had placed any\r\nreliance upon the negotiations for peace; for while they were pending,\r\nthe three powers were all assiduously preparing for war. In the spring\r\nof 1788, the Austrian internuncio declined any further attempt at\r\nmediation, and hostilities between Russia and Turkey were renewed.\r\n\r\nJoseph received the tidings with an outburst of joy. They lifted a load\r\nof grief from his heart; for war, to him, was balsam for every sorrow.\r\n\r\n\"Now I shall be cured of this last wound!\" exclaimed he, as he paced his\r\ncabinet, the dispatches in his hand. \"God is merciful--He has sent the\r\nremedy, and once more I shall feel like a sovereign and a man! How I\r\nlong to hear the bullets hiss and the battle rage! There are no myrtles\r\nfor me on earth; perchance I may yet be permitted to gather its laurels.\r\nWelcome, O war! Welcome the march, the camp, and the battle-field!\"\r\n\r\nHe rang, and commanded the presence of Field-Marshal Lacy. Then he read\r\nhis dispatches again, glancing impatiently, from time to tine, at the\r\ndoor. Finally it opened, and a page announced the field-marshal. Joseph\r\ncame hurriedly forward, and grasped the hands of his long-tried friend.\r\n\r\n\"Lacy,\" cried he, \"from this day you shall be better pleased than you\r\nhave been with me of late--I have seen your reproving looks--nay, do\r\nnot deny it, for they have been as significant as words; and if I made\r\nno answer, it was perhaps because I was guilty, and had nothing to say.\r\nYou have sighed over my dejection for months past, dear friend, but it\r\nhas vanished with the tidings I have just received I am ready to rush\r\nout into the storm, bold and defiant as Ajax!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how it rejoices my heart to hear such words!\" replied Lacy,\r\npressing Joseph's hand. \"I recognize my hero, my emperor again, and\r\nvictory is throned upon his noble brow! With those flashing eyes, and\r\nthat triumphant bearing, you will inspire your Austrians with such\r\nenthusiasm, that every man of them will follow whithersoever his\r\ncommander leads!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" cried Joseph, joyfully, \"you have guessed, then, why I requested\r\nyour presence here! Yes, Lacy, war is not only welcome to you and to me,\r\nbut I know that it will also rejoice the hearts of the Austrian army.\r\nAnd now I invite you to accompany me on my campaign against the Turks,\r\nand I give you chief command of my armies; for your valor and patriotism\r\nentitle you to the distinction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty knows that my life is consecrated to your service,\"\r\nreplied Laoy, with strong emotion. \"You know with what pride I would\r\nfight at your side, secure that victory must always perch upon the\r\nbanners of my gallant emperor.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you rejoice, do you not, Lacy, that our foe is to be the Moslem?\"\r\n\r\nLacy was silent for a while. \"I should rejoice from my soul.\" replied\r\nhe, with some hesitation, \"if Austria were fighting her own battles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our ally is distasteful to you?\" asked Joseph, laughing. \"You have not\r\nyet learned to love Russia?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no right to pass judgment upon those whom your majesty has\r\ndeemed worthy of your alliance, sire.\"\r\n\r\n\"No evasions, Lacy. You are pledged to truth when you enter these palace\r\nwalls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sire, if we are in the palace of truth, I must confess to a\r\nprejudice against Russia, and Russia's empress. Catharine calls for your\r\nmajesty's assistance, not to further the cause of justice or of right,\r\nbut to aid her in making new conquests.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not permit her to make any new conquests!\" cried Joseph. \"She\r\nmay fight out her quarrel with Turkey, and, so far, I shall keep my\r\npromise and sustain her. But I shall lend my sanction to none of her\r\nambitious schetney. I suffered the Porte to code Tauris to Catharine,\r\nbecause this cession was of inestimable advantage to me. It protected my\r\nboundaries from the Turk himself, and then it produced dissension\r\nbetween the courts of St. Petersburg and Berlin and so deprived the\r\nlatter of leer powerful ally. [Footnote: The emperor's own words.--See.\r\nGross-Hofflnger, iii., pp. 428, 429.] But having permitted Russia to\r\ntake possession of the Crimea, the aspect of affairs is changed. I never\r\nshall suffer the Russians to establish themselves in Constantinople. The\r\nturban I conceive to be a safer neighbor for Austria than the bat.\r\n[Footnote: The emperor's own words.--See\" Letters of Joseph ll.,\" p.\r\n135.] At this present time Russia offers me the opportunity of retaking\r\nBelgrade, and avenging the humiliation sustained by my father at the\r\nhands of the Porte. For two hundred years these barbarians of the East\r\nhave been guilty of bad faith toward my ancestors, and the time has\r\narrived when, as the avenger of all mankind, I shall deliver Europe from\r\nthe infidel, and the world from a race which for centuries has been the\r\nscourge of every Christian nation.\"\r\n\r\n\"And in this glorious struggle of Christianity and civilization against\r\nIslamism and barbarism, I shall be at my emperor's side, and witness his\r\ntriumph! This is a privilege which the last drop of my blood would be\r\ninadequate to buy!\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor again gave his hand. \"I knew that you would be as glad to\r\nfollow me as a war-horse to follow the trumpet's call. This time we\r\nshall have no child's play; it shall be war, grim, bloody war! And now\r\nto work. In one hour the courier must depart, who bears my manifesto to\r\nthe Porte. No, Lacy,\" continued the emperor, as Lacy prepared to leave,\r\n\"do not go. As commander-in-chief, you should be thoroughly acquainted\r\nwith the premises of our affair with Turkey, and you must hear both the\r\nmanifestoes which I an about to dictate. The first, of course, declares\r\nwar against the Porte. The second is, perhaps, a mere letter to the\r\nsuccessor of the great Frederick. His majesty of Prussia, foreseeing, in\r\nhis extreme wisdom, that I am likely to declare war against Turkey, is\r\nso condescending as to offer himself as mediator between us! You shall\r\nhear my answer, and tell me what you think of it.\"\r\n\r\nLacy bowed, and the emperor opening the door leading to the chancery,\r\nbeckoned to his private secretary. He entered, took his seat, and held\r\nhis pen ready to indite what Joseph should dictate. Lacy retired to the\r\nembrasure of a window, and with his arms crossed stood partly hidden by\r\nthe heavy crimson velvet curtains, his eyes fixed upon leis idolized\r\nsovereign.\r\n\r\nJoseph went restlessly to and fro, and dictated his manifesto to the\r\nPorte. Referring to his alliance with Russia, and the failure of his\r\nattempts at intervention, he went on to say that as the sincere friend\r\nand ally of the empress, he was compelled to fulfil his obligations, and\r\nreluctantly to take part in the war which Catharine had declared against\r\nTurkey. [Footnote: Hubner. ii., p. 468.]\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said the emperor, \"take another sheet and write 'To his majesty,\r\nthe King of Prussia.'\"\r\n\r\n\"My Royal Brother--\r\n\r\n\"It is with feelings of profound regret that I find myself forced to\r\ndecline your majesty's most friendly offers of mediation with Turkey. I\r\nam obliged to unsheathe my sword, and I shall not return it to the\r\nscabbard until it shall have won full reparation for all the wrongs\r\nsustained by my forefathers at the hands of the Porte. Your majesty is a\r\nmonarch, and as such, you are acquainted with the rights of kings. And\r\nis this undertaking of mine against Turkey any thing more than an\r\nattempt to resume the rights of which my throne has been dispossessed?\r\n\r\n\"The Turks (and perhaps not they alone) have a maxim, that whatever they\r\nlose in adverse times, they must win back when opportunity is favorable.\r\nBy such means the house of Hohenzollern has attained its present state\r\nof prosperity. Albert of Brandenburg wrested the duchy of Prussia from\r\nits order, and his successors, at the peace of Oliva, maintained their\r\nright to the sovereignty of that country.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty's deceased uncle, in like manner, wrested Silesia from my\r\nmother at a time when, surrounded by enemies, her only defences were her\r\nown true greatness and the loyalty of her subjects.\r\n\r\n\"What equivalent for her lost possessions has Austria received at the\r\nhands of those European courts who have blown so many blasts on the\r\nbalance of power?\r\n\r\n\"My forefathers were forced at different times to yield up Spain,\r\nNaples, Sicily, Belgrade, the principality of Silesia, Parma, Piacenza,\r\nGuastalla, Tortona, and a portion of Lombardy. What has Austria taken in\r\nreturn for these heavy loses?\r\n\r\n\"A portion of the kingdom of Poland! And one of less value than that\r\nassigned to Russia.\r\n\r\n\"I hope that you will not dispute the justice of my resolve to make war\r\nupon the Porte, and that you will not hold me less a friend because I\r\nmay do some injury to the Ottoman. Your majesty may rest assured that\r\nunder similar circumstances, I should apply the same principles to\r\nmyself, were I possessed of any of YOUR territory.\r\n\r\n\"I must also announce to you that, for some years to come, diplomacy\r\nmust give place to war.\r\n\r\n\"Hoping for a continuation of your majesty's friendship, I am, with\r\nhighest esteem, your friend and brother, JOSEPH.\" [Footnote: \"Letters of\r\nJoseph II.,\" page 121, and the following.]\r\n\r\nThe letter concluded, the emperor dismissed his secretary and threw\r\nhimself into an arm-chair.\r\n\r\n\"Well Lacy,\" said he, \"are you pleased with my letter? Have I convinced\r\nthe king that it is my duty to declare war against the Moslem?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" said Lacy, approaching, \"I thank you from my heart for the\r\nprivilege of hearing that letter. I know not which to admire most, your\r\nmajesty's admirable knowledge of the history of your house, or the quiet\r\nsharpness with which you have made your statements. But this I know,\r\nthat had you forbidden me to accompany you, I should have been, for the\r\nfirst time in my life, rebellious; for if I had not been allowed to\r\nfight as an officer, I should have done so as a private.\"\r\n\r\n\"There spoke my Lacy, my own gallant Austrian!\" exclaimed Joseph. \"To\r\nwork, then, to work! Promulgate your orders and set your men in motion.\r\nIn two days we must have two hundred thousand men on our frontiers. We\r\nmust draw a gigantic cordon from the Dniester to the Adriatic. The main\r\nbody, however, must go forward to Semlin and Futak. We two follow the\r\nmain army, and day after to-morrow we must set out, and--no,\" said the\r\nemperor, interrupting himself, while all the light died out from his\r\ncountenance. \"No--I cannot set out for a week yet. I must first bid\r\nadieu to the last tie that binds my heart (as a man) to this life! That\r\ntie riven, I live as all emperor and a warrior. Once in camp, I shall,\r\nHeaven be praised! forget all things else, and be myself again!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLXXII.\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE AND SEPARATION.\r\n\r\nThe eight long, weary days had gone by, the preparations for war were\r\ncomplete, and the emperor was ready to join his army. He had worked day\r\nand night, refusing to rest, and answering all remonstrances with a sad\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"I was not born a sovereign to devote my life to my own comfort,\" said\r\nhe, \"but to consecrate it to my empire. When I become too feeble to do\r\nmy duty, I shall ask for a pension and retire to a convent, like Charles\r\nthe Fifth. I have no taste, however, for the vocation, sincerely hoping\r\nto die as I have lived--an emperor.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, sire,\" said the imperial physician, Von Quarin, \"your first duty\r\nis to preserve your life for Austria's sake. You have a hot fever, and\r\nyour eyes and cheeks are hollow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me a cool drink, doctor, perchance it may refresh my burning\r\nheart,\" said Joseph, with sad irony.\r\n\r\n\"Cool drinks will do no good unless your majesty consents to take some\r\nrest. Sleep is the sovereign remedy of which you are in need, sire. \"\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish to sleep,\" replied Joseph, gloomily. \"Sleep brings happy\r\ndreams, and I hate them because of their falsehood! Who would dream of\r\nbliss, to wake and find it all a lie!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your valet told me that you did not lie down last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"My valet is a chatterbox, and knows not what he says.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, your majesty, I know that you have not been to bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I slept in an arm-chair! But no, I will not deny it. I sat up all\r\nnight, Quarin, for I had an important duty to perform before leaving\r\nVienna. I was making my will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your will!\" repeated Von Quarin. \"Surely your majesty does not fear--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I fear nothing--certainly not death,\" returned the emperor. \"It\r\nmust be sweet to die, and part from the disappointments of life; for man\r\neither goes to eternal sleep, or wakes forever to eternal happiness! I\r\nam not afraid of death, but I must put my house in order, for bullets\r\nrespect no man, and they have never yet been taught that an emperor is\r\nnot to be approached without ceremony. One might strike me on the head\r\nand send me to my eternal rest. Why, what a doleful face you wear,\r\nQuarin! `L'Empereur est mort!--Vive l'Empereur!' I shall bequeath to you\r\na noble young emperor and a beautiful arid charming empress. Is not that\r\nbetter than a surly old fellow like myself? Francis is my pride, and his\r\nsweet Elizabeth is like a daughter to me. I must then make my will and\r\nprovide for my children. Now, doctor, have you forgiven me for sitting\r\nup all night?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing to forgive, sire; but I implore you grant me one\r\nrequest.\"\r\n\r\n\"You wish to dose me with medicine! It is in your face; you carry an\r\napothecary's shop in your eyes just now.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sire, I wish to ask permission to follow you as your surgeon, that\r\nif any thing should happen, I may be there.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Quarin, you must not follow me. I cannot he guilty of the egotism\r\nwhich would monopolize your valuable services. A soldier in the field\r\nhas no right to be sick, lest he be suspected of cowardice and as for\r\ncasualties--why, if a ball should strike me, there are plenty of army\r\nsurgeons who will dress my wounds as they dress those of my men. Remain\r\nat home, then, my friend, and do better service by far than you could\r\nrender me on the battle-field. Farewell now. In two hours I leave, but\r\nbefore that time I have some important business on hand. First, I must\r\ngo with my will to Prince Kaunitz.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did your majesty hear that he had almost struck the Countess Clary, and\r\nhad banished her from his presence for a week, because she had\r\npronounced the word `testament' in his hearing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I was told of it, and I shall take good care not to bring down the\r\nvials of his wrath upon my head,\" said Joseph, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"I shall not pronounce the word 'testament,' I shall speak of my treaty\r\nof peace with life, and use every precaution to save his highness's\r\nfeelings. Strange mystery of life!\" continued the emperor, musing,\r\n\"forever changing shape and hue, like the nimble figures of a\r\nkaleidoscope! Well, I must use stratagem in this matter of the\r\n'testament,' for Kaunitz must assume the regency of the empire, and\r\nthen--then--I must attend a wedding. After that, the battlefield! Adieu,\r\nQuarin--if we meet no more on earth, I hope that we shall meet above.\"\r\n\r\nOne hour later the emperor returned from the hotel of his prime\r\nminister, and entered the imperial chapel. He was in full dress, decked\r\nwith all his orders. It was only on state occasions that Joseph appeared\r\nin his magnificent uniform; he had not worn it since the marriage of his\r\nnephew to the Princess Elizabeth of Wurtemberg. But his face was very\r\npale, and when he perceived the bride, he leaned for one moment against\r\na friendly pillar that saved him from reeling. This weakness, however,\r\nlasted but a moan, he walked firmly up to the altar, where the bridal\r\nparty stood awaiting the imperial entrance.\r\n\r\nThe emperor approached Count Dietrichstein, and greeted him cordially;\r\nthen turning to Count Kinsky he extended his hand. The bridegroom did\r\nnot appear to see this, for he cast down his eyes, and made a deep\r\ninclinatiou, while Joseph, with a sad smile, withdrew his hand.\r\n\r\nHe had not dared to look upon the trembling bride, who, seated on a\r\nchair, and surrounded by her attendants, had just recovered from a\r\nswoon. Her aunt, the Countess Dietrichstein, explained that from\r\nTherese's childhood, she never had been able to overcome her terror of\r\nlightning; and certainly, if this were so, she had every reason for\r\nterror now. The whole sky was darkened by one dense pall of heavy\r\nclouds; the stained windows of the chapel were fiery with angry\r\nlightning, while fierce above their heads the rolling thunder boomed\r\nalong the heavens, and then died away in low mutterings that made the\r\nearth tremble.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to await the passing away of the storm, for the guests\r\nat that hurried bridal were impatient to depart. The carriages of the\r\nemperor and of Count Dietrichstein here without, and neither could tarry\r\nlong in Vienna. At the altar stood Therese's uncle, Count Leopold von\r\nThun, Bishop of Passau, and around him was grouped a stately array of\r\nprelates and priests. Count Dietrichstein whispered in his daughter's\r\near. She rose from her seat, but her light figure swayed to and fro like\r\na slender tree before the advancing storm, and her lovely face was pale\r\nas that of a statue, just leaving the hand of the sculptor. Therese's\r\nfear of lightning was no fiction, and she almost sank to the floor as a\r\nlivid flash glanced across the form of the emperor, and enveloped him in\r\na sheet of living flame. Unheeding it, he moved on toward the unhappy\r\ngirl, and without a word or a look extended his hand. Therese,\r\ntrembling, gave him hers, and started when she felt the burning clasp\r\nthat closed upon her icy fingers. The emperor led her to the altar;\r\nbehind came the aunt and father of the bride, and between them Count\r\nKinsky, whose jealous eyes watched every movement of those hands which\r\njoined together for the space of a moment, were about to be sundered\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nNothing, however, was to be seen. The emperor's eyes were fixed upon the\r\naltar, those of Therese were cast down. Neither saw the other. Only the\r\nburning pressure of one hand and the clammy coldness of the other\r\nrevealed to both the extent of the sacrifice they were making to the\r\nMoloch of the world's opinion.\r\n\r\nNow they stood before the altar. The emperor gave the bride into the\r\nhands of the bridegroom, and stepped aside to take his place.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony over, the bishop pronounced the blessing, and all present\r\nknelt to receive it. Joseph and Therese were side by side. With a sigh\r\nthey raised their eyes to heaven, each praying for the other. The\r\nemperor's eyes were dim with tears, but he dashed them away, and, rising\r\nfrom his knees, prepared to congratulate the bride.\r\n\r\nA peal of thunder drowned the few words which he murmured. But her heart\r\ncaught the meaning, and she whispered in return\r\n\r\n\"Yes, in heaven.\"\r\n\r\nThen he dropped her hand, and addressed himself to the bridegroom.\r\n\r\n\"Count Kinsky,\" said he, authoritatively, \"I wish to speak with you in\r\nprivate.\"\r\n\r\nThe count, with a scowl, followed his sovereign to the nave of the\r\nchapel, where, at a distance from the bridal party, they were in no\r\ndanger of being overheard.\r\n\r\n\"Count,\" said the emperor, gravely, \"you love the Countess Therese?\"\r\n\r\nCount Kinsky was silent for a while. Then, suddenly, he replied in\r\nsharp, cutting accents\r\n\r\n\"I have loved her.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor repeated his words.\r\n\r\n\"You have loved her? Do you, then, love her no longer?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I love her no longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did you cease to love her?\"\r\n\r\n\"On this day week, your majesty,\" said the count, defiantly. Joseph\r\nwould not seem to observe the look which accompanied these words. His\r\nvoice was unchanged, as he replied\r\n\r\n\"Count, although you feel resentful toward me, you believe me to be a\r\nman of honor, do you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do, sire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I swear to you by all that is sacred to me as man and sovereign,\r\nthat Therese is as pure in the sight of Heaven as its brightest angel. I\r\nswear to you that she is as worthy as ever she was to be loved and\r\nesteemed by her husband as his wife and the future mother of his\r\nchildren.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty must have formed an intimate acquaintance with the\r\ncountess, to be able to answer for her purity of heart,\" returned\r\nKinsky, coldly.\r\n\r\nJoseph looked up, pained.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said he, \"you are implacable. But you believe me, do you not?\"\r\n\r\nThe count inclined his head.\r\n\r\n\"I dare not doubt my sovereign's word.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you will love Therese as she deserves to be loved?\"\r\n\r\n\"Love is not to be controlled--not even by an emperor. My love and hate\r\nare not to be drawn off and on like a glove!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hate!\" cried the emperor, shocked. \"Great God! it cannot be possible\r\nthat you hate the woman whom you have voluntarily chosen, and whom even\r\nnow, before yonder altar, you have sworn to love. Why, then, did you\r\nmarry her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, you commanded me to do so just one week ago, and, as a loyal\r\nsubject, I was compelled to obey. You gave me no alternative, and I\r\nmarried her.\"\r\n\r\n\"She will make you happy,\" replied Joseph, in a faltering voice. \"I\r\nbeseech of you, be gentle with her. Her heart is not at ease, and she\r\nneeds all your tenderness to restore her to happiness.\"\r\n\r\nCount Kinsky bowed frigidly.\r\n\r\n\"Will your majesty allow me to ask a favor of you?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"It will gratify me to do any thing for you,\" replied Joseph, his eyes\r\nlighting up with pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"Then I ask of your majesty, on your Honor, to answer the question I am\r\nabout to ask.\"\r\n\r\n\"On my honor, count, I will answer it,\" said Joseph, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"What did your majesty say to the countess just now, and what was her\r\nreply?\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor was thunderstruck--he could not articulate a word.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty was so obliging as to promise an answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, count, yes,\" faltered the emperor. \"You shall be satisfied. I\r\nsaid, 'Farewell, Therese, I shall claim thee in heaven.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty was so condescending as to address my wife in this\r\nfamiliar strain? And her reply was--\"\r\n\r\n\"Only these words, `Yes, in heaven.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank your majesty.\"\r\n\r\nThey both returned to the company. Joseph cast one last look at Therese,\r\nwho, pale and rigid, was receiving the congratulations of her\r\nunsuspecting friends, and then he addressed her father.\r\n\r\n\"Well, count, I believe that our furlough has expired, and we must\r\nreturn to our commands. Farewell! and may we both return victorious to\r\nVienna!\"\r\n\r\nA half an hour later, an imperial caleche conveyed him to the array, and\r\nto Field-Marshal Lacy, who had preceded him there by several days.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment, the travelling-carriage of Count Kinsky drove up to\r\nhis hotel. Count Dietrichstein, before setting out, had accompanied his\r\ndaughter to her husband's residence, and had bidden her adieu. Therese\r\nwas now alone. She shuddered as she heard Count Kinsky's step, and\r\nwished from her soul that death would release her from the hateful tie\r\nwhich bound them together.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and he appeared. She uttered a faint cry, and pressed\r\nher hands to her throbbing heart. Count Kinsky answered the cry with a\r\nlaugh of scorn.\r\n\r\n\"Are you afraid?\" said he, striding toward her, and contemplating her\r\nwith a face indicative of smothered passion.\r\n\r\nTherese raised her eyes, and looked fearlessly into his eyes\r\n\r\n\"No, Count Kinsky, I am not afraid, nor would I fear, if you had come to\r\nkill me.\"\r\n\r\nThe count laughed aloud. \"Ah!\" cried he, in a harsh, grating voice, \"you\r\nthink that I might do like Prince Bragation and the Duke of Orleans, who\r\nstrangled their young wives because they suspected them of infidelity!\r\nMy dear madame, these romantic horrors belong to a bygone century. In\r\nthis sober and prosaic age, a nobleman avenges his wounded honor, not by\r\nmurder, but by contempt. I have only intruded myself to ask if you are\r\nready to start?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am ready,\" replied Therese, wearily.\r\n\r\n\"Then allow me to accompany you to the carriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"My father having given you my hand, I have no right to refuse your\r\nescort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before we go, be so condescending as to say which one of my estates you\r\nprefer for a residence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Select my residence yourself, count; you know that I have never visited\r\nyour estates.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I choose for you my castle in Hungary, near the Turkish frontier,\r\nfor there you will have the latest news from the army and its\r\ncommanders.\"\r\n\r\nTherese made no reply to this sarcasm. She bent her head, and said: \"I\r\nam ready to submit myself to your decision in all things.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope that the Countess Therese will not long have to live in\r\nsubjection to her husband,\" continued he, \"and that the journey which I\r\nam about to undertake will result happily for us both. You go to\r\nHungary, I go to Rome. I go to implore of the pope a divorce.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are going to sue for a divorce?\" asked Therese, \"Perhaps you can\r\nspare yourself the trouble of a journey to Rome, count, for I have\r\nalready anticipated your wishes. My petition to his holiness went\r\nseveral days ago, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"His majesty, the emperor, was so obliging as to send it by an imperial\r\ncourier. Is that what you were about to say?\"\r\n\r\nTherese continued as though she had not heard the interruption \"My\r\napplication went through Monsignore Garampi, the papal nuncio, who\r\npromised to use his influence in my behalf.\"\r\n\r\n\"What an edifying couple!\" exclaimed Kinsky, with another scornful\r\nlaugh. \"How congenial! The same wishes, and, unconsciously, the very\r\nsame deeds! What a pity we must part so soon, for, I leave you to-day;\r\nnor shall I have the pleasure of seeing you again until I bring you a\r\ndecree of divorce.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will be most welcome,\" returned Therese, calmly. \"Now be so good as\r\nto escort me to my carriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray give me your arm. I have but one more observation to make. I hope\r\nthat you will now be able to prove substantially to the emperor that it\r\nwas quite useless for him to shelter himself behind the words, 'I shall\r\nclaim thee in heaven!' But if I may presume so far, I request that you\r\nwill defer these demonstrations until I return from Rome with my letters\r\nof divorce.\"\r\n\r\nTherese had no strength to retort. She hung down her head, and large\r\nscalding tears fell from her eyes. Count Kinsky placed her in the\r\ncarriage, closed the door, and then returned to his own\r\ntravelling-chariot, which was a few paces behind. The two equipages\r\nthundered down the streets together, but at the gates they parted, the\r\none taking the road for Hungary, the other for Rome. [Footnote: This\r\nwhole story is Historical. The \"heavenly Therese,\" as she is called by\r\nHormayer, was really married and thus abandoned by her husband, who\r\npersisted in believing that the connection between herself and the\r\nemperor was not guiltless. But the count met with no success in the\r\nmatter of the divorce. The pope refused.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLXXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST DREAM OF GLORY.\r\n\r\nDestiny was testing the fortitude of the emperor with unrelenting\r\nharshness. It would seem that inflexible fate stood by, while one by one\r\nthis man's hopes of fame, honor, and love were wrested away, that the\r\nworld might see and know how much of bitterness and disappointment it is\r\nin the power of one human heart to endure.\r\n\r\nIn the Netherlands and in Hungary he was threatened with rebellion. The\r\nMagyars especially resented the violation of their constitutional\r\nrights; in Tyrol, too, the people were disaffected; and Rome had not yet\r\npardoned him the many indignities she had endured at his hands. This\r\nvery war, which he had welcomed as a cure for his domestic sorrows, was\r\nyielding him naught but annoyance and misery.\r\n\r\nYes, destiny had decreed that nothing which he undertook should prosper.\r\nHis army, which was encamped in the damp marshes that lie between the\r\nDanube and Save, was attacked by a malarious fever more destructive by\r\nfar than the bloodiest struggle that ever reddened the field of battle.\r\nThe hospitals were crowded with the sick and dying, and the enfeebled\r\nsoldiers, who dragged themselves about their ramps, wore sullen and\r\ndiscontented faces; a spirit of insubordination was beginning to\r\nmanifest itself among the troops, and the very men who would have rushed\r\nto the cannon's mouth, grew cowardly at the approach of the invisible\r\nfoe that stole away their lives, by the gradual and insidious poison of\r\ndisease. The songs and jests of the bivouac were hushed, the white tents\r\nwere mournful as sepulchres, and the men lost all confidence in their\r\nleaders. They now accused the emperor and Lacy of incapacity, and\r\ndeclared that they must either be disbanded or led against the enemy.\r\n\r\nThis was precisely what Joseph had been longing to do, but he was\r\ncompelled to await the advance of the Russians, with whom it had been\r\narranged that the Austrians were to take a junction before they marched\r\ninto Turkey. The Russians, however, had never joined the emperor; for\r\nsome misunderstanding with Sweden had compelled the czarina to defend\r\nher northern frontier, and so she had as yet been unable to assemble an\r\narmy of sufficient strength to march against Turkey. Joseph then was\r\ncondemned to the very same inaction which had so chafed his spirit in\r\nBavaria; for his own army of itself was not numerous enough to attack\r\nthe enemy. He could not snake a move without Russia. Russia tarried, and\r\nthe fever in the camp grew every day more fatal.\r\n\r\nInstead of advancing, the heart-sick emperor was forced to retreat. His\r\nartillery was withdrawn to Peterwardein, and the siege of Belgrade\r\nentirely relinquished. Disease and death followed the Austrians to\r\ntheir new encampment, and louder grew the mutterings of the men,\r\nand more bitter their denunciations of the emperor.\r\n\r\nThey little knew that while they were assailed by physical infirmities,\r\ntheir hapless chieftain was sick both in body and mind. He shared all\r\ntheir hardships, and watched them with most unremitting solicitude. He\r\nerected camp hospitals, and furnished the sick with wine and delicacies\r\nwhich he ordered from Vienna for their use. All military etiquette was\r\nsuspended; even the approach of the emperor for the time being was to be\r\nignored. Those who were lying down were to remain lying, those who were\r\nsitting were to keep their seats.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Joseph walked daily through the hospitals, bestowing care and\r\nkindness upon all, and no man there remarked that the deadly malaria had\r\naffected him in an equal degree with his troops. Heat, hardships, and\r\ndisappointment had done their work as effectually upon the\r\ncommander-in-chief as upon the common soldier; but no one suspected that\r\nfever was consuming his life; for by day, Joseph was the Providence of\r\nhis army, and by night, while his men were sleeping, he was attending to\r\nthe affairs of his vast empire. He worked as assiduously in camp as he\r\nhad ever done at home in his palace. Every important measure of the\r\nregency was submitted to him for approval; the heads of the several\r\ndepartments of state were required to send him their reports; and many a\r\nnight, surrounded by heaps of dispatches, he sat at his little table, in\r\nthe swampy woods, whose noxious atmosphere was fitter for the snakes\r\nthat infested them than for human beings of whatever condition in life.\r\n[In the archives of Vienna is preserved a dispatch of Joseph, written in\r\nthe open woods on the night before the taking of\r\nSabacz.--Gross-Hoffinger, iii., p. 464.]\r\n\r\nOne little ray of light relieved the darkness of this gloomy period.\r\nThis was the taking of the fortress of Sabacz where Joseph led the\r\nassault in person. Three cannoneers were shot by his side, and their\r\nblood bespattered his face and breast. But in the midst of danger he\r\nremained perfectly composed, and for many a day his countenance had not\r\nbeamed with an expression of such animated delight. This success,\r\nhowever, was no more than a lightning-flash relieving the darkness of a\r\ntempestuous night. The fortress won, the Austrians went back to their\r\nmiserable encampment in the sickly morasses of Siebenburgen.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the stagnant quiet was broken by the announcement that the\r\nTurks had crossed the Danube. This aroused the army from their sullen\r\nstupor, and Joseph, as if freed from an incubus, joyfully prepared\r\nhimself for action.\r\n\r\nThe trumpet's shrill call was heard in the camp, and the army commenced\r\ntheir march. They had advanced but a few miles when they were met by\r\nseveral panic-stricken regiments, who announced that the Austrian lines\r\nhad been broken in two places, that General Papilla had been forced to\r\nretreat, and that the victorious Turks were pouring their vast hordes\r\ninto Hungary.\r\n\r\nLike wildfire the tidings spread through the army, and they, too, began\r\ntheir retreat, farther and yet farther back; for, ever as they moved,\r\nthey were lighted on their way by the burning villages and towns that\r\nwere the tokens of a barbarous enemy's approach. The homeless fugitives,\r\ntoo, rent the air with their cries, and clamored for protection against\r\nthe cruel infidel.\r\n\r\nNo protection could they find, for the Austrians were too few in number\r\nto confront the devastating hosts of the invading army. They were still\r\ncompelled to retreat as far as the town of Lugos, where at last they\r\nmight rest from the dreadful fatigues of this humiliating flight. With\r\ninexpressible relief, the soldiers sought repose. They were ordered,\r\nhowever, to sleep on their arms, so that the artilleryman was by his\r\ncannon, the mounted soldier near his horse, and the infantry, clasping\r\ntheir muskets, lay in long rows together, all forgetting every thing\r\nsave the inestimable blessing of stretching their limbs and wooing\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nThe mild summer moon looked down upon their rest, and the emperor, as he\r\nmade a last tour of inspection to satisfy himself that all lights were\r\nextinguished, rejoiced to think that the Turks were far away, and his\r\ntired Austrians could sleep secure.\r\n\r\nJoseph returned to his tent, that is, his caleche. He, too, was\r\nexhausted, and closed his eves with a sense of delicious languor. The\r\nnight air, blowing about his temples, refreshed his fevered brow, and he\r\ngave himself up to dreams such as are inspired by the silvered\r\natmosphere, when the moon, in her pearly splendor, looks down upon the\r\ntroubled earth, and hushes it to repose.\r\n\r\nThe emperor, however, did not sleep. For a while, he lay with closed\r\neyes, and then, raising himself, looked up toward the heavens. Gradually\r\nthe sky darkened; cloud met cloud and obscured the moon's disk, until at\r\nlast the firmament was clothed in impenetrable blackness. The emperor,\r\nwith a sad smile, thought how like the scene had been to the panorama of\r\nhis life, wherein every star had set, and whence every ray of light had\r\nfled forever!\r\n\r\nHe dreamed on, while his tired men slept. Not all, however, for, far\r\ntoward the left wing of the army, a band of hussars were encamped around\r\na wagon laden with brandy, and, having much more confidence in the\r\nrestorative powers of liquor than of sleep, they had been invigorating\r\nthemselves with deep potations. Another company of soldiers in their\r\nneighborhood, awakened by the noisy mirth of the hussars, came forward\r\nto claim their share of the brandy. It was refused, and a brawl ensued,\r\nin which the assailants were repulsed.\r\n\r\nThe hussars, having driven them from the field, proceeded to celebrate\r\ntheir victory by renewed libations, until finally, in a state of\r\ncomplete inebriation, they fell to the ground, and there slept the sleep\r\nof the intoxicated.\r\n\r\nThe men who had been prevented from participating in these drunken\r\nrevels resolved to revenge themselves by a trick. They crept stealthily\r\nup to the spot where the hussars were lying, and, firing off their\r\nmuskets, cried out, \"The Turks! the Turks!\"\r\n\r\nStupefied by liquor, the sleepers sprang up, repeating the cry. It was\r\ncaught and echoed from man to man, while the hussars, with unsheathed\r\nsabres, ran wildly about, until hundreds and hundreds were awakened,\r\neach one echoing the fearful words--\r\n\r\n\"The Turks! the Turks!\"\r\n\r\n\"Halt! halt!\" cried a voice to the terrified soldiers. \"Halt, men,\r\nhalt!\"\r\n\r\nThe bewildered ears mistook the command for the battle-cry of the Turks,\r\n\"Allah! Allah!\" and the panic increased tenfold. \"We are surrounded!\"\r\nshrieked the terror-stricken Austrians, and every sabre was drawn, and\r\nevery musket cocked. The struggle began; and the screams of the\r\ncombatants, the groans of the wounded, the sighs of the dying filled the\r\nair, while comrade against comrade, brother against brother, stood in\r\nmortal strife and slew each other for the unbelieving Turk.\r\n\r\nThe calamity was irretrievable. The darkness of the night deceived every\r\nman in that army, not one of whom doubted that the enemy was there. Some\r\nof the terrified soldiers fled back to their camps, and, even there,\r\nmistaken for Turks, they were assaulted with sabre and musket, and\r\nfrightful was the carnage that ensued!\r\n\r\nIn vain the officers attempted to restore discipline. There was no more\r\nreason in those maddened human beings than in the raging waves of the\r\nocean--The emperor, at the first alarm, had driven in his caleche to the\r\nplace whence the sound seemed to come.\r\n\r\nBut what to a panic-stricken multitude was the voice of their emperor?\r\nBall after ball whistled past his ears, while he vainly strove to make\r\nthem understand that they were each one slaying his brother! And the\r\nnight was so hideous, so relentless in its darkness! Not one star\r\nglimmered upon the face of the frightful pall above--the stars would not\r\nlook upon that fratricidal stuggle!\r\n\r\nThe fugitives and their infuriated pursuers pressed toward a little\r\nbridge which spanned a stream near the encampment. The emperor drove\r\nrapidly around, and reached the banks of the river before them, hoping\r\nthence to be heard by his men, and to convince them that no Turks were\r\nby.\r\n\r\nBut they heeded the sound of his voice no more than the sea heeded that\r\nof the royal Canute. Trey precipitated themselves toward the bridge,\r\ndriving the carriage of the emperor before them to the very edge of the\r\nsteep river-bank. It wavered; they pushed against it with the butt-ends\r\nof their muskets. They saw nothing--they knew nothing save that the\r\ncarriage impeded their flight!\r\n\r\nIt fell, rumbling down the precipice into the deep waters which bubbled\r\nand hissed and then closed over it forever. No man heeded its fall. Not\r\none of all that crowd, which oft had grown hoarse with shouts at his\r\ncoming, paused to save the emperor from destruction. But he, calm and\r\ncourageous, although at that moment he could have parted with life\r\nwithout a sigh, had made a desperate spring backward, and had alighted\r\non the ground.\r\n\r\nWhen he recovered from the violence of the fall, he found himself\r\nunhurt, but alone. Not one of his suite was to be seen; in the mad rush\r\nof the men for the crossing, they had been parted from him. The little\r\nrustic bridge bad fallen in, and those who remained behind had rushed\r\nwith frantic yells in search of some other crossing. The emperor could\r\nhear their cries in the distance, and they filled his heart with anguish\r\ninexpressible.\r\n\r\nWith desponding eyes he gazed upward, and murmured, \"Oh, that I could\r\ndie before the sun rises upon the horrors of this night My soul is\r\nweary--my every hope dead. Why did I turn back when death was smiling\r\nfrom the crystal depths of that placid stream? Even now, I may still\r\nfind rest. Who will ever know how the emperor met his fate?\" He paused,\r\nand looked around to see if any thing was nigh. Nothing! He made one\r\nstep forward, then shuddering, recoiled with an exclamation of horror at\r\nhis miserable cowardice.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" cried he, resolutely, \"no, I will not die--I must not, dare not\r\ndie. I cannot go to the grave misjudged and calumniated by my own\r\nsubjects! I must live, that, sooner or later, they may learn how\r\nfaithfully I have striven to make them happy! I must live to convince\r\nthem that the promotion of their welfare has been the end and aim of my\r\nwhole life!\" [Footnote: The emperor's own words.--Hubner, ii., p. 488.]\r\n\r\nAt that moment there was a rent in the blackened firmament, and the moon\r\nemerged, gradually lighting up the dark waters and the lonely woods,\r\nuntil its beams shone full upon the pale, agitated features of that\r\nbroken-hearted monarch.\r\n\r\n\"The emperor!\" cried a loud voice, not far away. \"The emperor!\" and a\r\nrider, galloping forward, threw himself from his horse.\r\n\r\n\"Here, your majesty, here is my horse. Mount him. He is a sure and fleet\r\nanimal.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know me, then?\" asked Joseph.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire; I am one of your majesty's grooms. Will you do me the honor\r\nto accept my horse?\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor replied by swinging himself into the saddle. \"But you, my\r\ngood fellow, what will you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall accompany your majesty,\" replied the groom, cheerfully. \"There\r\nis many a horse seeking its master to-night, and it will not be long\r\nbefore i capture one. If it please your majesty, I will conduct you to\r\nKaransches. The moon has come out beautifully, and I can easily find the\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have found MY way,\" murmured the emperor to himself. \"God has pointed\r\nit out to me, by sending help in this dark, lonely hour. Well, life has\r\ncalled me back, and I must bear its burdens until Heaven releases me.\"\r\n\r\nJust then a horse cane by, at full speed. The groom, who was walking by\r\nthe emperor's side, darted forward, seized the reins, and swung himself\r\ntriumphantly into the saddle.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sire,\" said he, \"we can travel lustily ahead. We are on the right\r\nroad, and in one hour will reach Karansebes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Karansebes!\" mused the emperor. \"'Cara mini sedes!' Thus sang Ovid, and\r\nfrom his ode a city took her name--the city where the poet found his\r\ngrave. A stately monument to Ovid is Karansebes; and now a lonely,\r\nheart-sick monarch is coming to make a pilgrimage thither, craving of\r\nOvid's tomb the boon of a resting-place for his weary head. Oh, Cara\r\nmihi sedes, where art thou?\"\r\n\r\nIn the gray of the morning they reached Karansebes. Here they found some\r\nfew of the regiments, the emperor's suite, and his beloved nephew Franz,\r\nwho, like his uncle, had been almost hurried to destruction by the\r\nhapless army, but had been rescued by his bold and faithful followers.\r\nThey had shielded the archduke with their own bodies, forming a square\r\naround his person, and escorting him, so guarded, until they had\r\npenetrated the dangerous ranks of the demented fugitives. [Footnote:\r\nHubner, ii:, p. 477.]\r\n\r\nAll danger was past, but the events of that night were too much for the\r\nexhausted frame of the emperor. The fever, with which he had wrestled so\r\nlong, now mastered his body with such violence that he was no longer\r\nable to mount his horse. Added to this, came a blow to his heart. The\r\narmy refused to follow him any longer. They called loudly for Loudon,\r\nthe old hero, who, in spite of his years, was the only man in Austria\r\nwho would lead them to victory.\r\n\r\nThe emperor, stung to the soul by the mistrust of his men, gave up his\r\nlast hope of military glory. He sent for Loudon; and Loudon, despite his\r\ninfirmities, came at the summons.\r\n\r\nThe old hero was received with shouts of welcome. The huzzas reached the\r\npoor, mean room where Joseph lay sick with a burning fever. He listened\r\nwith a sad smile, but his courage gave way, and scalding tears of\r\ndisappointed ambition moistened his pillow. \"Loudon has come,\" thought\r\nhe, \"and the emperor is forgotten! No one cares for him more!--Well--I\r\nmust return to Vienna, and pray that the victory and fame, which have\r\nbeen denied to me, may be vouchsafed to Loudon!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLXXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE HUNGARIANS AGAIN.\r\n\r\nDestiny had broken the emperor's heart. He returned from the army\r\nseriously ill, and although he had apparently recuperated during the\r\nwinter, the close of the year found him beyond all hope of recovery.\r\n\r\nEven the joyful intelligence of Loudon's victories was powerless to\r\nrestore him to health. Loudon had won several battles, and had\r\naccomplished that for which Joseph had undertaken the war with Turkey.\r\nHe had once more raised the Austrian flag over the towers of Belgrade.\r\n[Footnote: The conquest of Belgrade was accompanied by singular\r\ncoincidences. The Emperor Francis (the husband of Maria Theresa) had\r\nbeen in command when, in 1739, the Turks took it from Austria. His\r\ngrandson, Francis, with his own hand fired the first gun, when it was\r\nretaken by Loudon. In 1789 General Wallace surrendered the fortress to\r\nOsman Pacha. In 1789 Osman Pacha, the son of the latter, surrendered it\r\nto General (afterward Field-Marshal) Wallace, son of the\r\nformer.--Hubner, ii., p. 492.]\r\n\r\nVienna received these tidings with every demonstration of joy. The city\r\nwas illuminated for three days, and the emperor shared the enthusiasm of\r\nthe people. He took from his state-uniform the magnificent cross of\r\nMaria Theresa--the cross which none but an emperor had ever worn--and\r\nsent it to London with the title and patent of generalissimo. [Footnote:\r\nThis cross was worth 24,000 ducats.--Gross-Hotfinger, iii., p. 500.] He\r\nattended the Te Deum, and to all appearances was as elated as his\r\nsubjects. But once alone with Lacy, the mask fell, and the smile faded\r\nfrom his colorless lips.\r\n\r\n\"Lacy,\" said he, \"I would have bought these last superfluous laurels of\r\nLoudon with my life. But for me no laurels have ever grown; the cypress\r\nis my emblem--the emblem of grief.\"\r\n\r\nHe was right. Discontent reigned in Hungary, in the Netherlands, and\r\nlatterly in Tyrol. On every side were murmurs and threats of rebellion\r\nagainst him who would have devoted every hour of his life to the\r\nenlightenment of his subjects. All Belgium had taken up arms. The\r\nimperial troops had joined the insurgents, and now a formidable army\r\nthreatened the emperor. Van der Noot, the leader of the revolt,\r\npublished a manifesto, declaring Belgium independent of the Austrian\r\nempire. The insurgents numbered ten thousand. They were headed by the\r\nnobles and sustained by the clergy. Masses were said for the success of\r\nthe rebels, and requiems were sung for those who fell in battle or\r\notherwise. [Footnote: Gross-Hoffinger, iii., p. 289.] The cities of\r\nBrussels, Antwerp, Louvain, Mechlin, and Namur, opened their doors to\r\nthe patriots. The Austrian General D'Alton fled with his troops to\r\nLuxemburg, and three millions of florins, belonging to the military\r\ncoffers, fell into the hands of the insurgents. [Footnote: D'Alton was\r\ncited before the emperor, but on his way to Vienna he took poison and\r\ndied four days before Joseph.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of the Austrian empire toward the close of the\r\nyear 1789. The emperor resolved to make one more attempt to bring the\r\nBelgians to reason, and to this end he sent Count Cobenzl to Brussels,\r\nand, after him, Prince de Ligne.\r\n\r\nThe prince came to take leave of the emperor. \"I send you as a mediator\r\nbetween myself and your countrymen,\" said Joseph, with a languid smile.\r\n\"Prove to those so-called patriots that you, who endeavor to reconcile\r\nthem to their sovereign, are the only Belgian of them all who possesses\r\ntrue patriotism.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, I shall say to my misguided countrymen that I have seen your\r\nmajesty weep over their disloyalty. I shall tell them that it is not\r\nanger which they have provoked in your majesty's heart, but sorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Joseph, \"I sorrow for their infatuation, and they are\r\nfast sending me to the grave. The taking of Ghent was my death-struggle,\r\nthe evacuation of Brussels my last expiring sigh. Oh!\" continued he, in\r\ntones of extreme anguish--\"oh, what humiliation! I shall surely die of\r\nit! I were of stone, to survive so many blows from the hand of fate! Go,\r\nDe Ligne, and do your best to induce your countrymen to return to their\r\nallegiance. Should you fail; dear friend, remain there. Do not sacrifice\r\nyour future to me, for you have children.\" [Footnote: The emperor's own\r\nwords--\"Envres du Prince de Ligne,\"]\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire,\" replied De Ligne, with emotion, \"I have children, but they\r\nare not dearer to me than my sovereign. And now, with your majesty's\r\npermission, I will withdraw, for the hour of my departure is at hand. I\r\ndo not despair of success. Farewell, sire, for a while.\"\r\n\r\n\"Farewell forever!\" murmured Joseph, as the door closed behind the\r\nprince. \"Death is not far off, and I have so much to do!\"\r\n\r\nHe arose hastily from his arm-chair, and opening the door that led into\r\nthe chancery, called his three secretaries.\r\n\r\n\"Let us to work,\" said he, as they entered.\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" replied one of them, in faltering tones, \"Herr von Quarin\r\ndesired us, in his name, to implore of your majesty to rest for a few\r\ndays.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot do it,\" said Joseph, impatiently. \"If I postpone this writing\r\nanother day, it may never be accomplished at all. Give in your reports.\r\nWhat dispatches have we from Hungary?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are most unsatisfactory, sire. The landed proprietors have refused\r\nto contribute their share of the imposts, and the people rebel against\r\nthe conscription-act, and threaten the officers of the crown with\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\n\"Revolt, revolt everywhere!\" exclaimed the emperor, shuddering. \"But I\r\nwill not yield; they shall all submit!\"\r\n\r\nThe door of the cabinet opened, and the marshal of the household\r\nentered, announcing a deputation of Magyars.\r\n\r\n\"A deputation! From whom?\" asked Joseph, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know, sire, but Count Palfy is one of the deputies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Count Palfy again!\" cried the emperor, scornfully. \"When the Hungarians\r\nhave a sinister message to send, they are sure to select Count Palfy as\r\ntheir ambassador. Show them to the reception-room which opens into my\r\ncabinet, count. I will see them there.\"\r\n\r\nHe dismissed the secretaries, and rang for his valet. He could scarcely\r\nstand, while Gunther was assisting him to change his dressing-gown for\r\nhis uniform. [Footnote: This was the brother of him who was the lover of\r\nRachel.] His toilet over, he was obliged to lean upon the valet for\r\nsupport, for his limbs were almost failing him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" cried he, bitterly, \"how it will rejoice them to see me so weak\r\nand sick! They will go home and tell their Hungarians that there is no\r\nstrength left in me to fight with traitors! But they shall not know it.\r\nI will be the emperor, if my life pay the forfeit of the exertion. Lead\r\nme to the door, Gunther. I will lean against one of the pillars, and\r\nstand while I give audience to the Magyars.\"\r\n\r\nGunther supported him tenderly to the door, and then threw it wide open.\r\nIn the reception-room stood the twelve deputies, not in court-dress, but\r\nin the resplendent costume of their own nation. They were the same men\r\nwho, several years before, had appeared before the emperor, and Count\r\nPalfy, the Chancellor of Hungary, was the first one to advance.\r\n\r\nThe emperor bent his head, and eyed his visitors.\r\n\r\n\"If I am not mistaken,\" said he, \"these are the same gentlemen who\r\nappeared here as Hungarian deputies several years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire, we are the same men,\" replied Count Palfy.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you here again?\"\r\n\r\n\"To repeat our remonstrances, sire. The kingdom of Hungary has chosen\r\nthe same representatives, that your majesty may see how unalterable is\r\nour determination to defend our rights with our lives. Hungary has not\r\nchanged her attitude, sire, and she will never change it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor shall I ever change mine,\" cried Joseph, passionately.\r\n\r\n\"My will to-day is the same as it was six years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, sire, you must expect an uprising of the whole Hungarian nation,\"\r\nreturned Count Palfy, gravely. \"For the last time we implore your\r\nmajesty to restore us our rights.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you call your rights?\" asked Joseph, sarcastically.\r\n\r\n\"All that for centuries past has been guaranteed to us by our\r\nconstitution; all that each king of Hungary, as he came to the throne,\r\nhas sworn to preserve inviolate. Sire, we will not become an Austrian\r\nprovince; we are Hungarians, and are resolved to retain our nationality.\r\nThe integrity of Hungary is sorely threatened; and if your majesty\r\nrefuse to rescue it, we must ourselves hasten to the rescue. Not only\r\nour liberties are menaced, but our moneyed interests too. Hungary is on\r\nthe road to ruin, if your majesty does not consent to revoke your\r\narbitrary laws, or--\"\r\n\r\n\"Or?\"--asked Joseph, as Palfy hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"On the road to revolution,\" replied the deputy firmly.\r\n\r\n\"You presume to threaten me!\" cried Joseph, in a loud voice.\r\n\r\n\"I dare deliver the message intrusted to me, and, had I been too weak to\r\nspeak it, intrusted to those who accompany me. Is it not so, Magyars?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, it is,\" cried all, unanimously.\r\n\r\n\"Sire, I repeat to you that Hungary is advancing either toward ruin or\r\nrevolution. Like the Netherlanders, we will defend our constitution or\r\ndie with it. Oh, your majesty, all can yet be remedied! Call a\r\nconvention of the states--return the crown of St. Stephen, and come to\r\nHungary to take the coronation oath. Then you will see how gladly we\r\nshall swear allegiance to our king, and how cheerfully we will die for\r\nhim, as our fathers did before us, in defence of the empress-queen, his\r\nmother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give us our constitution, and we will die for our king!\" cried the\r\nMagyars in chorus.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, humble myself before you!\" exclaimed Joseph, furiously.\r\n\r\n\"You would have the sovereign bow before the will of his vassals!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sire,\" returned Count Palfy, with feeling. \"We would have your\r\nmajesty adopt the only means by which Hungary can be retained to the\r\nAustrian empire. If you refuse to hear us, we rise, as one man, to\r\ndefend our country. We swear it in the name of the Hungarian nation!\"\r\n\r\n\"We swear it in the name of the Hungarian nation!\" echoed the Magyars.\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" replied Joseph, pale and trembling with passion, \"I swear it in\r\nthe name of my dignity as your sovereign, that I never will yield to men\r\nwho defy me, nor will I ever forgive those who, by treasonable\r\nimportunity, have sought to wring from me what I have not thought it\r\nexpedient to grant to respectful expostulation!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire, if you would give this proof of love to your subjects, if, for\r\ntheir sakes, you would condescend to forget your imperial station, you\r\ncannot conceive what enthusiasm of loyalty would be your return for this\r\nconcession. In mortal anxiety we await your final answer, and await it\r\nuntil to-morrow at this hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!--you are so magnanimous as to grant me a short reprieve!\" shouted\r\nthe infuriated emperor, losing all command of himself. \"You--\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly he ceased, and became very pale. He was sensible that he had\r\nburst a blood-vessel, and he felt the warm stream of his life welling\r\nupward, until it moistened his pallid lips. With a hasty movement he\r\ndrew out his handkerchief, held it for a moment before his mouth, and\r\nthen replaced it quickly in his bosom. Large drops of cold sweat stood\r\nout from his brow, and the light faded from his eyes. But these haughty\r\nMagyars should not see him fall! They should not enjoy the sight of his\r\nsufferings!\r\n\r\nWith one last desperate effort he collected his expiring energies, and\r\nstood erect.\r\n\r\n\"Go,\" said he, in firm, distinct tones; \"you have stated your\r\ngrievances, you shall have my answer to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"We await your majesty until to-morrow at noon,\" returned Count Palfy.\r\n\"Then we go, never to return.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go!\" cried the emperor, in a piercing voice; and the exasperated\r\nMagyars mistook this last cry of agony for the culmination of his wrath.\r\nThey bowed in sullen silence, and left the room.\r\n\r\nThe emperor reeled back to his cabinet, and fell into a chair. He\r\nreached the bell, and rang it feebly.\r\n\r\n\"Gunther,\" said he to his valet, and now his voice was hardly audible,\r\n\"send a carriage for Quarin. I must see him at once.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLXXV.\r\n\r\nTHE REVOCATION.\r\n\r\nWhen Quarin entered the emperor's cabinet, he found him quietly seated\r\nbefore his escritoire half buried in documents: The physician remained\r\nstanding at the door, waiting until he should be ordered to approach.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Joseph was interrupted in his writing by a spell of coughing.\r\nHe dropped his pen, and leaned back exhausted. Quarin hastened to his\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty must not write,\" said he, gravely. \"You must lay aside all\r\nwork for a time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe that I shall have to lay it aside forever,\" replied Joseph,\r\nlanguidly. \"I sent for you to say that I have a lawsuit with my lungs,\r\nand you must tell me which of us is to gain it.\" [Footnote: Joseph's own\r\nwords.--\"Characteristics of Joseph II.\" p. 14]\r\n\r\n\"What am I to tell your majesty?\" asked the physician, disturbed.\r\n\r\nThe emperor looked up with eyes which glowed with the flaming light of\r\nfever. \"Quarin, you understand me perfectly. You must tell me, in regard\r\nto this lawsuit with my lungs, which is to gain it, myself or death?\r\nHere is my evidence.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words he drew out his handkerchief and held it open between\r\nhis wan, transparent hands. It was dyed in blood.\r\n\r\n\"Blood!\" exclaimed Quarin, in a tone of alarm. \"Your majesty has\r\nreceived a wound?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, an interior wound. The Hungarians have dealt me my death-blow.\r\nThis blood is welling up from a wounded heart. Do not look so mournful,\r\ndoctor. Let us speak of death as man to man. Look at me now, and say\r\nwhether my malady is incurable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should it be incurable?\" asked the physician, faltering. \"You are\r\nyoung, sire, and have a sound constitution.\"\r\n\r\n\"No commonplaces, Quarin, no equivocation,\" cried Joseph, impatiently.\r\n\"I must have the truth, do you hear me?--the truth. I cannot afford to\r\nbe surprised by death, for I must provide for a nation, and my house\r\nmust be set in order. I am not afraid of death, my friend; it comes to\r\nme in the smiling guise of a liberator. Therefore be frank, and tell the\r\nat once whether my malady is dangerous.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he raised his large, brilliant eyes to the face of the physician.\r\nQuarin's features were convulsed with distress, and tears stood in his\r\neyes. His voice was very tremulous as he replied\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire, it is dangerous.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor's countentance remained perfectly calm. \"Can you tell me\r\nwith any degree of precision how long I have to live?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sire; you may live yet for several weeks, or some excitement may\r\nput an end to your existence in a few days. In this malady the patient\r\nmust be prepared at any moment for death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it is incurable?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire,\" faltered Quarin, his tears bursting forth afresh.\r\n\r\nThe emperor looked thoughtfully before him, and for some time kept\r\nsilence. Then extending his hand with a smile, he said,\r\n\r\n\"From my soul I thank you for the manly frankness with which you have\r\ntreated me, Quarin, and I desire now to give you a testimony of my\r\ngratitude. You have children, have you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire--two daughters.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are not rich, I believe?\"\r\n\r\n\"The salary which I receive from your majesty, united to my practice,\r\naffords us a comfortable independence.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor nodded. \"You must do a little commission for me,\" said he,\r\nturning to the escritoire and writing a few lines, which he presented to\r\nQuarin.\r\n\r\n\"Take this paper to the court chancery and present it to the bureau of\r\nfinances. You will there receive ten thousand florins wherewith to\r\nportion your daughters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sire!\" exclaimed Quarin, deeply moved, \"I thank you with all the\r\nstrength of my paternal heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Joseph, gently, \"it is my duty to reward merit. [Footnote:\r\nThese are the emperor's words. This scene is historical.--Hubner. ii.,\r\np. 496.] In addition to this, I would wish to leave you a personal\r\nsouvenir of my friendship. I bestow upon you, as a last token of my\r\naffection, the title of freiherr, and I will take out the patent for you\r\nmyself. Not a word, dear friend, not a word! Leave me now, for I must\r\nwork diligently. Since my hours are numbered, I must make the most of\r\nthem. Farewell! Who knows how soon I may have to recall you here?\"\r\n\r\nThe physician kissed the emperor's hand with fervor, and turned hastily\r\naway. Joseph sank back in the chair. His large eyes were raised to\r\nheaven, and his wan face beamed with something brighter than\r\nresignation.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the door of the chancery was opened, and the first\r\nprivy-councillor came hastily forward.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" said Joseph, with a slight start.\r\n\r\n\"Sire, two couriers have just arrived. The first is from the Count\r\nCobenzl. He announces that all Belgium, with the exception of Luxemburg,\r\nis in the hands of the patriots; that Van der Noot has called a\r\nconvention of the United Provinces, which has declared Belgium a\r\nrepublic; her independence is to be guaranteed by England, Prussia, and\r\nHolland. Count Cobenzl is urgent in his request for instructions. He is\r\ntotally at a loss what to do.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor had listened with mournful tranquillity. \"And the second\r\ncourier?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"The second courier, sire, comes from the imperial stadtholder of\r\nTyrol.\"\r\n\r\n\"What says he?\"\r\n\r\n\"He brings evil tidings, sire. The people have rebelled, and cry out\r\nagainst the conscription and the church reforms. Unless these laws are\r\nrepealed, there is danger of revolution.\"\r\n\r\nThe emperor uttered a piercing cry, and pressed his hands to his breast.\r\n\"It is nothing,\" said he, in reply to the anxious and alarmed looks of\r\nthe privy-councillor. \"A momentary pang, which has already passed\r\naway--nothing more. Continue your report.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is all, your majesty. The stadtholder entreats you to quiet this\r\nrebellion and--\"\r\n\r\n\"And to revoke my decrees, is it not so? The same croaking which for\r\neight years has been dinned into my ears. Well--I must have time to\r\nreflect, and as soon as I shall have determined upon my course of\r\naction, you shall learn my decision.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rebellion in Tyrol, in Hnngary, in the Netherlands!\" murmured the\r\nemperor, when he found himself alone. \"From every side I hear my\r\ndeath-knell! My people would bury me ere I have drawn my last sigh. My\r\ngreat ancestor, Charles, stood beside his open grave, and voluntarily\r\ncontemplated his last resting-place; but I! unhappy monarch, am forced\r\ninto mine by the ingratitude of a people for whom alone I leave lived!\r\nIs it indeed so? Must I die with the mournful conviction that I have\r\nlived in vain? O my God, what excess of humiliation Thou hast forced\r\nupon me! And what have I done to deserve such a fate? Wherein have I\r\nsinned, that my imperial crown should have been lined with so many cruel\r\nthorns? Is there no remedy? must I drink this last bitter chalice? Must\r\nI revoke that which I have published to the world as my sovereign will?\"\r\n\r\nHe ceased, and folding his arms, faced his difficult position. For one\r\nhour he sat motionless, his face grooving gradually paler, his brow\r\ndarker, his lips more rigidly compressed together.\r\n\r\nAt length he heaved one long, convulsive sigh. \"No--there is no other\r\nremedy. I have toiled in vain--my beautiful structure has fallen, and my\r\ngrave is under its ruins! O my God, why may I not have a few months more\r\nof life, wherewith to crush these aspiring rebels? But no!. I must die\r\nnow, and leave them to triumph over my defeat; for I dare not leave to\r\nmy successor the accursed inheritance of civil war. To the last hour of\r\nmy life I must humble my will before the decree of that cruel destiny\r\nwhich has persecuted me from boyhood! Be it so!--I must clutch at the\r\nremedy--the fearful remedy--I must revoke!\"\r\n\r\nHe shuddered, and covered his face with his hands. There had been one\r\nstruggle with his will, there was now another with his despair. He\r\nmoaned aloud--scalding tears trickled through his poor, wasted fingers,\r\nand his whole being bowed before the supremacy of this last great\r\nsorrow. Once--only once, he uttered a sharp cry, and for a moment his\r\nconvulsed countenance was raised to heaven. Then his head fell upon the\r\ntable, and his wretchedness found vent in low, heart-rending sobs.\r\n\r\nAnd thus he spent another long hour. Finally he looked up to heaven and\r\ntried to murmur a few words of resignation. But the spectre of his\r\nuseless strivings still haunted his mind. \"All my plans to be buried in\r\nthe grave--not one trace of my reign left to posterity!\" sighed the\r\nunhappy monarch. \"But enough of repining. I have resolved to make the\r\nsacrifice--it is time to act!\"\r\n\r\nHe clutched his bell, and ordered a page to summon the privy-councillor\r\nfrom the adjoining room.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said the emperor, \"let us work. My hand is too tremulous to hold\r\na pen; you must write for me.--First, in regard to Hungary. Draw up a\r\nmanifesto, in which I restore their constitution in all its integrity.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused for a few moments, and wiped the large drops of cold sweat\r\nwhich were gathering over his forehead. \"Do you hear?\" continued he; \"I\r\nrevoke all my laws except one, and that is, the edict of religious\r\ntoleration. I promise to convoke the imperial diet, and to replace the\r\nadministration of justice upon its old footing. I repeal the laws\r\nrelating to taxes and conscription, I order the Hungarian crown to be\r\nreturned to Ofen, and, as soon as I shall have recovered from my\r\nillness, I promise to take the coronation-oath. [Footnote: This is the\r\nrevocation edict, which, promulgated a few weeks before the death of\r\nJoseph, caused such astonishment throughout Europe--Gross-Hoffinger,\r\niii., p. 290.] Write this out and bring it to me for signature. Then\r\ndeliver it into the hands A Count Palfy. He will publish it to the\r\nHungarians.\r\n\r\n\"So much for Hungary!--Now for Tyrol. Draw up a second manifesto. I\r\nrepeal the conscription-act, as well as all my reforms with respect to\r\nthe church. When this is ready, bring it to me for signature; and\r\ndispatch a courier with it to the imperial stadtholder. Having satisfied\r\nthe exactions of Hungary and Tyrol, it remains to restore order in the\r\nNetherlands. But there, matters are more complicated, and I fear that no\r\nconcession on my part will avail at this late hour. I must trample my\r\npersonal pride in the dust, then, and humble myself before the pope!\r\nYes--before the pope! I will write, requesting him to act as mediator,\r\nand beg his holiness to admonish the clergy to make peace with me.\r\n[Footnote: Gross-Hoffinger, iii., p.379] Why do you look so sad, my\r\nfriend? I am making my peace with the world; I am drawing a pen across\r\nthe events of my life and blotting out my reforms with ink. Make out\r\nthese documents at once, and send me a courier for Rome. Meanwhile I\r\nwill write to the pope. Appearing before him as a petitioner, it is\r\nincumbent upon me to send an autographic letter. Return to me in an\r\nhour.\"\r\n\r\nWhen, one hour later, the privy-councillor re-entered the cabinet, the\r\nletter to the pope lay folded and addressed on the table. But this last\r\nhumiliation had been too much for the proud spirit of the emperor to\r\nbrook.\r\n\r\nHe lay insensible in his chair, a stream of blood oozing slowly from his\r\nghastly lips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER CLXXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH OF THE MARTYR.\r\n\r\nHe had made his peace with the world and with God! He had taken leave of\r\nhis family, his friends, and his attendants. He had made his last\r\nconfession, and had received the sacraments of the church.\r\n\r\nHis struggles were at an end. All sorrow overcome, he lay happy and\r\ntranquil on his death-bed, no more word of complaint passing the lips\r\nwhich had been consecrated to the Lord. He comforted his weeping\r\nrelatives, and had a word of affectionate greeting for every one who\r\napproached him. With his own feeble hand he wrote farewell letters to\r\nhis absent sisters, to Prince Kaunitz, and to several ladies for whom he\r\nhad an especial regard; and on the seventeenth of February signed his\r\nname eighty times.\r\n\r\nHe felt that his end was very near; and when Lacy and Rosenberg, who\r\nwere to pass the night with him, entered his bedchamber, he signed them\r\nto approach.\r\n\r\n\"It will soon be over,\" whispered he. \"The lamp will shortly be\r\nextinguished. Hush! do not weep--you grieve me. Let us part from each\r\nother with fortitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas, how can we part with fortitude, when our parting is for life!\"\r\nsaid Lacy.\r\n\r\nThe emperor raised his eyes, and looked thoughtfully un to heaven. \"We\r\nshall meet again,\" said he, after a pause. \"I believe in another and a\r\nbetter world, where I shall find compensation for all that I have\r\nendured here below.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where punishment awaits those who have been the cause of your\r\nsorrows,\" returned Rosenberg.\r\n\r\n\"I have forgiven them all,\" said the dying monarch. \"There is no room in\r\nmy heart for resentment, dear friends. I have honestly striven to make\r\nmy subjects happy, and feel no animosity toward them for refusing the\r\nboon I proffered. I should like to have inscribed upon my tomb, 'Here\r\nlies a prince whose intentions were pure, but who was so unfortunate as\r\nto fail in every honest undertaking of his life.' Oh, how mistaken was\r\nthe poet, who wrote,\r\n\r\n    `Et du trone au cerenell le passage est terrible!'\r\n\r\n\"I do not deplore the loss of my throne, but I feel some, lingering\r\nregret that I should have made so few of my fellow-beings happy--so\r\nmany of them ungrateful. This, however, is the usual lot of princes!\"\r\n[Footnote: The emperor's own words.--\"Characteristics of Joseph II.,\" p.\r\n23.]\r\n\r\n\"It is the lot of all those who are too enlightened for their times! It\r\nis the lot of all great men who would elevate and ennoble the masses!\"\r\ncried Lacy. \"It is the fate of greatness to be the martyr of stupidity,\r\nbigotry, and malice!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is the word,\" said Joseph, smiling. \"I am a martyr, but\r\nnobody will honor my relics.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, beloved sovereign,\" cried Rosenberg, weeping, \"your majesty's love\r\nwe shall bear about our hearts, as the devotee wears the relic of a\r\nmarytred saint.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not weep so,\" said Joseph. \"We have spent so many happy days\r\ntogether, that we must pass the few fleeting hours remaining to us in\r\nrational intercourse. Show me a cheerful countenance, Rosenberg--you\r\nfrom whose hands I received my last cup of earthly comfort. What blessed\r\ntidings you brought me! My sweet Elizabeth is a mother, and I shall\r\ncarry the consciousness of her happiness to the grave. I shall die with\r\nONE joy at my heart--a beautiful hope shall blossom as I\r\nfall!--Elizabeth is your future empress; love her for my sake; you know\r\nhow unspeakably dear she is to me. And, now that I think of it, I have\r\nnot heard from her since this morning. How is she?\"\r\n\r\nThe two friends were silent, and cast down their eves.\r\n\r\n\"Lacy!\" cried the emperor, and over his inspired features there passed a\r\nshade of human sorrow. \"Lacy, speak--you are silent--O God, what has\r\nhappened? Rosenberg, tell me, oh tell me, how is my Elizabeth, my\r\ndarling daughter?\"\r\n\r\nSo great were his anxiety and distress, that he half rose in his bed.\r\nThey would not meet his glance, but Rosenberg in a low voice replied:\r\n\r\n\"The archduchess is very sick. The labor was long and painful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, she is dead!\" exclaimed Joseph, \"she is dead, is she not?\"\r\n\r\nNeither of his weeping friends spoke a word, but the emperor\r\ncomprehended their silence.\r\n\r\nFalling back upon his pillow, he raised his wasted arms to heaven.\r\n--\"O God, Thy will be done! but my sufferings are beyond expression!\r\nI thought that I had outlived sorrow: but the stroke which has come to\r\nimbitter my last moments exceeds all that I have endured throughout a\r\nlife of uncheckered misery!\" [Footnote: The emperor's own words.]\r\n\r\nFor a long time he lay cold and rigid. Then raising himself upon his\r\narm, he signed to Rosenberg to approach. His eyes beamed as of erst, and\r\nhis whole demeanor was that of a sovereign who had learned, above all\r\nthings, to control himself.\r\n\r\n\"She must be buried with all the tenderness and honor of which she was\r\ndeserving,\" said he. \"Rosenberg, will you attend to this for me? Let her\r\nbody be exposed in the court-chapel to-morrow. After that, lay her to\r\nrest in the imperial vaults, and let the chapel be in readiness to\r\nreceive my own remains.\" [Footnote: Joseph's own words.--See Hubner,\r\nii., p. 491.]\r\n\r\nThis was the last command given by the emperor. From that hour he was\r\nnothing more than a poor, dying mortal, whose last thoughts are devoted\r\nto his Maker. He sent for his confessor, and asked him to read something\r\nappropriate and consolatory. With folded hands, his large violet eyes\r\nreverently raised to heaven, he listened to the holy scriptural words.\r\nSuddenly his countenance brightened, and his lips moved.\r\n\r\n\"Now here remain faith, hope, and love,\" read the priest.\r\n\r\nThe emperor repeated the three last words, \"faith--hope\" and when he\r\npronounced the word \"love,\" his face was illumined with a joy which had\r\nits source far, far away from earth!\r\n\r\nThen all was silent. The prayer was over, and the dying emperor lay\r\nmotionless, with his hands folded upon his breast.\r\n\r\nPresently his feeble voice was heard in prayer. \"Father, Thou knowest my\r\nheart--Thou art my witness, that I meant--to do--well Thy will be done!\"\r\n[Footnote: Ramshorn, p. 410]\r\n\r\nThen all was still. Weeping around the bed stood Lacy, Rosenberg, and\r\nthe Archduke Francis. The emperor looked at them with staring eyes, but\r\nhe recognized them no longer. Those beautiful eves were dimmed forever!\r\n\r\nSuddenly the silence was broken by a long, long sigh.\r\n\r\nIt was the death-sigh of JOSEPH THE SECOND!\r\n\r\nJoseph died on the 20th of February, 1790. But his spirit outlived him\r\nand survives to the present day. His subjects, who had so misjudged him,\r\ndeplored his loss, and felt how dear he had been to them. Now that he\r\nwas dead--now that they had broken his heart, they grieved and wept for\r\nhim. Poets sang his praises in eulogies, and wrote epitaphs laudatory of\r\nhim who may be considered the great martyr of political and social\r\nenlightenment",
