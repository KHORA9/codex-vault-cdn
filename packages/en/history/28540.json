This e-book was prepared\r\n      from a reprint of the 1876 edition, published by Thoemmes Press\r\n      and Kinokuniya Company Ltd. in 1997. Where the reprint was\r\n      unclear, the transcriber consulted a copy of the actual 1876\r\n      edition.\r\n\r\n      Footnotes\r\n\r\n         The original contains numerous footnotes, denoted by numbers\r\n         prior to Part I, and by symbols in the remainder of the book.\r\n         All of the footnotes are consecutively numbered in this\r\n         e-book; footnotes within footnotes are lettered.\r\n\r\n         Some of the footnotes contain lengthy book catalogues with\r\n         descriptions and prices. For ease of reading, in this e-book\r\n         these catalogues have been formatted as lists rather than\r\n         tables.\r\n\r\n      Text that in the original was rendered in blackletter is\r\n      enclosed between equal signs (=bold face=).\r\n\r\n      Letters with macrons are enclosed in brackets and preceded by\r\n      an equal sign, e.g. [=a].\r\n\r\n      Spelling and typographical errors are retained as they appear\r\n      in the original, with a [Transcriber's Note] containing the\r\n      correct spelling. Minor obvious punctuation and font errors\r\n      have been corrected without note. Inconsistent diacriticals and\r\n      hyphenation have been retained as they appear in the original.\r\n\r\n      There are frequent inconsistencies in the spelling of certain\r\n      proper names. These have been retained as they appear in the\r\n      original, for example:\r\n\r\n         Bibliothèque/Bibliothéque\r\n         Boccaccio/Bocaccio/Boccacio\r\n         De Foe/Defoe\r\n         Français/François\r\n         Loménie/Lomenie\r\n         Montfauçon/Montfaucon\r\n         Roxburgh/Roxburghe\r\n         Shakspeare/Shakespeare\r\n         Spenser/Spencer\r\n         Tewrdannckhs/Tewrdranckhs/Teurdanckhs (and other variations)\r\n         Vallière/Valliere\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOMANIA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n     _Libri quosdam ad Scientiam, quosdam AD INSANIAM, deduxêre._\r\n       GEYLER: Navis Stultifera: sign.

The course of thirty years has necessarily brought changes and\r\nalterations amongst \"men and things.\" The dart of death has been so\r\nbusy during this period that, of the Bibliomaniacs so plentifully\r\nrecorded in the previous work, scarcely_ three,_--including the\r\nAuthor--have survived. This has furnished a monitory theme for the\r\nAPPENDIX; which, to the friends both of the dead and the living,\r\ncannot be perused without sympathising emotions--_\r\n\r\n     _\"A sigh the absent claim, the DEAD a tear.\"_\r\n\r\n_The changes and alterations in \"things,\"--that is to say in the_\r\n=Bibliomania= _itself--have been equally capricious and unaccountable:\r\nour countrymen being, in_ these _days, to the full as fond of novelty\r\nand variety as in those of Henry the Eighth. Dr. Board, who wrote his_\r\nIntroduction of Knowledge _in the year 1542, and dedicated it to the\r\nPrincess Mary, thus observes of our countrymen:_\r\n\r\n     _I am an Englishman, and naked do I stand here,\r\n     Musing in my mind what raiment I shall wear;\r\n     For now I will wear_ this, _and now I will wear_ that,\r\n     _Now I will wear--I cannot tell what._\r\n\r\n_This highly curious and illustrative work was reprinted, with all its\r\nwood-cut embellishments, by Mr. Upcott. A copy of the original and\r\nmost scarce edition is among the Selden books in the Bodleian library,\r\nand in the Chetham Collection at Manchester. See the_ Typographical\r\nAntiquities, _vol._ iii. _p._ 158-60.\r\n\r\n_But I apprehend the general apathy of Bibliomaniacs to be in a great\r\nmeasure attributable to the vast influx of BOOKS, of every\r\ndescription, from the Continent--owing to the long continuance of\r\npeace; and yet, in the appearance of what are called_ English\r\nRarities, _the market seems to be almost as barren as ever. The\r\nwounds, inflicted in the HEBERIAN contest, have gradually healed, and\r\nare subsiding into forgetfulness; excepting where, from_ collateral\r\n_causes, there are too many_ striking _reasons to remember their\r\nexistence._\r\n\r\n_Another motive may be humbly, yet confidently, assigned for the\r\nre-appearance of this Work. It was thought, by its late\r\nproprietor,--MR. EDWARD WALMSLEY[1]--to whose cost and liberality this\r\nedition owes its appearance--to be a volume, in itself, of pleasant\r\nand profitable perusal; composed perhaps in a quaint and original\r\nstyle, but in accordance with the characters of the_ Dramatis Personæ.\r\n_Be this as it may, it is a work divested of all acrimonious\r\nfeeling--is applicable to all classes of society, to whom harmless\r\nenthusiasm cannot be offensive--and is based upon a foundation not\r\nlikely to be speedily undermined._\r\n\r\n_T.F. DIBDIN._\r\n\r\n_May_ 1, 1842.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 1: _Mr. EDWARD WALMSLEY, who died in 1841, at an\r\n     advanced age, had been long known to me. He had latterly\r\n     extensive calico-printing works at Mitcham, and devoted much\r\n     of his time to the production of beautiful patterns in that\r\n     fabrication; his taste, in almost every thing which he\r\n     undertook, leant towards the fine arts. His body was in the\r\n     counting-house; but his spirit was abroad, in the studio of\r\n     the painter or engraver. Had his natural talents, which were\r\n     strong and elastic, been cultivated in early life, he would,\r\n     in all probability, have attained a considerable reputation.\r\n     How he loved to embellish--almost to satiety--a favourite\r\n     work, may be seen by consulting a subsequent page towards\r\n     the end of this volume. He planned and published the_\r\n     Physiognomical Portraits, _a performance not divested of\r\n     interest--but failing in general success, from the prints\r\n     being, in many instances, a repetition of their precursors.\r\n     The thought, however, was a good one; and many of the heads\r\n     are powerfully executed. He took also a lively interest in\r\n     Mr. Major's splendid edition of Walpole's_ Anecdotes of\r\n     Painting in England, _a work, which can never want a reader\r\n     while taste has an abiding-place in one British bosom._\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Walmsley possessed a brave and generous spirit; and I\r\n     scarcely knew a man more disposed to bury the remembrance of\r\n     men's errors in that of their attainments and good\r\n     qualities._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BIBLIOMANIA;\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n=Book-Madness;=\r\n\r\nCONTAINING SOME ACCOUNT OF THE\r\n\r\nHISTORY, SYMPTOMS, AND CURE OF THIS FATAL DISEASE.\r\n\r\nIN AN EPISTLE ADDRESSED TO\r\n\r\nRICHARD HEBER, ESQ.\r\n\r\nBY THE\r\n\r\nREV.

I might easily have swelled the size of this\r\ntreatise by the introduction of much additional, and not incurious,\r\nmatter; but I thought it most prudent to wait the issue of the present\r\n\"recipe,\" at once simple in its composition and gentle in its\r\neffects._\r\n\r\n_Some apology is due to the amiable and accomplished character to whom\r\nmy epistle is addressed, as well as to the public, for the apparently\r\nconfused and indigested manner in which the notes are attached to the\r\nfirst part of this treatise; but, unless I had thrown them to the end\r\n(a plan which modern custom does not seem to warrant), it will be\r\nobvious that a different arrangement could not have been adopted; and\r\nequally so that the perusal, first of the text, and afterwards of the\r\nnotes, will be the better mode of passing judgment upon both._\r\n\r\nT.F.D.\r\n\r\n_Kensington, June_ 5, 1809.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTO THE READER.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A short time after the publication of the first edition of this work,\r\na very worthy and shrewd Bibliomaniac, accidentally meeting me,\r\nexclaimed that \"the book_ would do, _but that there was not_ gall\r\n_enough in it.\" As he was himself a_ Book-Auction-loving Bibliomaniac,\r\n_I was resolved, in a future edition, to gratify him and similar\r\nCollectors by writing_ PART III. _of the present impression; the motto\r\nof which may probably meet their approbation._\r\n\r\n_It will be evident, on a slight inspection of the present edition,\r\nthat it is so much altered and enlarged as to assume the character of\r\na new_ work. _This has not been done without mature reflection; and a\r\nlong-cherished hope of making it permanently useful to a large class\r\nof General Readers, as well as to Book-Collectors and Bibliographers._\r\n\r\n_It appeared to me that notices of such truly valuable, and oftentimes\r\ncurious and rare, books, as the ensuing pages describe; but more\r\nespecially a_ Personal History of Literature, _in the characters of_\r\nCollectors of Books; _had long been a desideratum even with classical\r\nstudents: and in adopting the present form of publication, my chief\r\nobject was to relieve the dryness of a didactic style by the\r\nintroduction of_ Dramatis Personæ.\r\n\r\n_The worthy Gentlemen, by whom the_ Drama _is conducted, may be\r\ncalled, by some, merely wooden machines or_ pegs _to hang notes upon;\r\nbut I shall not be disposed to quarrel with any criticism which may be\r\npassed upon their acting, so long as the greater part of the\r\ninformation, to which their dialogue gives rise, may be thought\r\nserviceable to the real interests of_ Literature _and_ Bibliography.\r\n\r\n_If I had chosen to assume a more imposing air with the public, by\r\nspinning out the contents of this closely-printed book into two or\r\nmore volumes--which might have been done without violating the\r\ncustomary mode of publication--the expenses of the purchaser, and the\r\nprofits of the author, would have equally increased: but I was\r\nresolved to bring forward as much matter as I could impart, in a\r\nconvenient and not inelegantly executed form; and, if my own\r\nemoluments are less, I honestly hope the reader's advantage is\r\ngreater._\r\n\r\n_The_ Engraved Ornaments of Portraits, Vignettes, and Borders, _were\r\nintroduced, as well to gratify the eyes of tasteful Bibliomaniacs, as\r\nto impress, upon the minds of readers in general, a more vivid\r\nrecollection of some of those truly illustrious characters by whom\r\nthe_ HISTORY OF BRITISH LITERATURE _has been preserved._\r\n\r\n_It remains only to add that the present work was undertaken to\r\nrelieve, in a great measure, the anguish of mind arising from a severe\r\ndomestic affliction; and if the voice of those whom we tenderly loved,\r\nwhether parent or_ child, _could be heard from the_ grave, _I trust it\r\nwould convey the sound of approbation for thus having filled a part of\r\nthe measure of that time which, every hour, brings us nearer to those\r\nfrom whom we are separated._\r\n\r\n_And now_, BENEVOLENT READER, _in promising thee as much amusement and\r\ninstruction as ever were offered in a single volume, of a nature like\r\nto the present, I bid thee farewell in the language of_ Vogt,[2] _who\r\nthus praises the subject of which we are about to treat:--\"Quis non_\r\nAMABILEM _eam laudabit_ INSANIAM, _quæ universæ rei litterariæ non\r\nobfuit, sed profuit; historiæ litterariæ doctrinam insigniter\r\nlocupletavit; ingentemque exercitum voluminum, quibus alias aut in\r\nremotiora Bibliothecarum publicarum scrinia commigrandum erat, aut\r\nplane pereundum, a carceribus et interitu vindicavit, exoptatissimæque\r\nluci et eruditorum usui multiplici felicitur restituit?\"_\r\n\r\nT.F.D.\r\n\r\n_Kensington, March_ 25, 1811.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 2: Catalogus Librorum Rariorum, præf. ix. edit.\r\n     1793.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.

Dr.\r\nDIBDINS BIBLIOMANIA, 1840.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n=The Bibliomania.=\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nWhen the poetical Epistle of Dr. Ferriar, under the popular title of\r\n\"THE BIBLIOMANIA,\" was announced for publication, I honestly confess\r\nthat, in common with many of my book-loving acquaintance, a strong\r\nsensation of fear and of hope possessed me: of fear, that I might have\r\nbeen accused, however indirectly, of having contributed towards the\r\nincrease of this Mania; and of hope, that the true object of\r\nbook-collecting, and literary pursuits, might have been fully and\r\nfairly developed. The perusal of this elegant epistle dissipated alike\r\nmy fears and my hopes; for, instead of caustic verses, and satirical\r\nnotes,[3] I found a smooth, melodious, and persuasive panegyric;\r\nunmixed, however, with any rules for the choice of books, or the\r\nregulation of study.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 3: There are, nevertheless, some satirical\r\n     allusions which one could have wished had been suppressed.\r\n     For instance:\r\n\r\n          He turns where PYBUS rears his atlas-head\r\n          Or MADOC'S mass conceals its veins of lead;\r\n\r\n     What has Mr. Pybus's gorgeous book in praise of the late\r\n     Russian Emperor Paul I. (which some have called the\r\n     chef-d'oeuvre of Bensley's press[A]) to do with Mr.\r\n     Southey's fine Poem of Madoc?--in which, if there are \"veins\r\n     of lead,\" there are not a few \"of silver and gold.\" Of the\r\n     extraordinary talents of Mr. Southey, the indefatigable\r\n     student in ancient lore, and especially in all that regards\r\n     Spanish Literature and Old English Romances, this is not the\r\n     place to make mention. His \"_Remains of Henry Kirk White_,\"\r\n     the sweetest specimen of modern biography, has sunk into\r\n     every heart, and received an eulogy from every tongue. Yet\r\n     is his own life\r\n\r\n          \"The more endearing song.\"\r\n\r\n     Dr. Ferriar's next satirical verses are levelled at Mr.\r\n     THOMAS HOPE.\r\n\r\n          \"The lettered fop now takes a larger scope,\r\n          With classic furniture, design'd by HOPE.\r\n          (HOPE, whom upholsterers eye with mute despair,\r\n          The doughty pedant of an elbow chair.\")\r\n\r\n     It has appeared to me that Mr. Hope's magnificent volume on\r\n     \"_Household Furniture_\" has been generally misunderstood,\r\n     and, in a few instances, criticised upon false\r\n     principles.--The first question is, does the _subject_ admit\r\n     of illustration? and if so, has Mr. Hope illustrated it\r\n     properly? I believe there is no canon of criticism which\r\n     forbids the treating of such a subject; and, while we are\r\n     amused with archæological discussions on Roman tiles and\r\n     tesselated pavements, there seems to be no absurdity in\r\n     making the decorations of our sitting rooms, including\r\n     something more than the floor we walk upon, a subject at\r\n     least of temperate and classical disquisition. Suppose we\r\n     had found such a treatise in the volumes of Gronovius and\r\n     Montfaucon? (and are there not a few, apparently, as\r\n     unimportant and confined in these rich volumes of the\r\n     Treasures of Antiquity?) or suppose something similar to Mr.\r\n     Hope's work had been found among the ruins of Herculaneum?\r\n     Or, lastly, let us suppose the author had printed it only as\r\n     a _private_ book, to be circulated as a present! In each of\r\n     these instances, should we have heard the harsh censures\r\n     which have been thrown out against it? On the contrary, is\r\n     it not very probable that a wish might have been expressed\r\n     that \"so valuable a work ought to be made public.\"\r\n\r\n     Upon what principle, _a priori_, are we to ridicule and\r\n     condemn it? I know of none. We admit Vitruvius, Inigo Jones,\r\n     Gibbs, and Chambers, into our libraries: and why not Mr.\r\n     Hope's book? Is decoration to be confined only to the\r\n     exterior? and, if so, are works, which treat of these only,\r\n     to be read and applauded? Is the delicate bas-relief, and\r\n     beautifully carved column, to be thrust from the cabinet and\r\n     drawing room, to perish on the outside of a smoke-dried\r\n     portico? Or, is not _that_ the most deserving of\r\n     commendation which produces the most numerous and pleasing\r\n     associations of ideas? I recollect, when in company with the\r\n     excellent DR. JENNER,\r\n\r\n          ----[clarum et venerabile nomen\r\n          Gentibus, et multum nostræ quod proderat urbi]\r\n\r\n     and a half dozen more friends, we visited the splendid\r\n     apartments in Duchess Street, Portland Place, we were not\r\n     only struck with the appropriate arrangement of every thing,\r\n     but, on our leaving them, and coming out into the dull foggy\r\n     atmosphere of London, we acknowledged that the effect\r\n     produced upon our minds was something like that which might\r\n     have arisen had we been regaling ourselves on the silken\r\n     couches, and within the illuminated chambers, of some of the\r\n     enchanted palaces described in the Arabian Nights'\r\n     Entertainments. I suspect that those who have criticised Mr.\r\n     Hope's work with asperity have never seen his house.\r\n\r\n     These sentiments are not the result of partiality or\r\n     prejudice, for I am wholly unacquainted with Mr. Hope. They\r\n     are delivered with zeal, but with deference. It is quite\r\n     consolatory to find a gentleman of large fortune, of\r\n     respectable ancestry, and of classical attainments, devoting\r\n     a great portion of that leisure time which hangs like a\r\n     leaden weight upon the generality of fashionable people, to\r\n     the service of the Fine Arts, and in the patronage of merit\r\n     and ingenuity. How much the world will again be indebted to\r\n     Mr. Hope's taste and liberality may be anticipated from the\r\n     \"_Costume of the Ancients_,\" a work which has recently been\r\n     published under his particular superintendence.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote A: This book is beautifully executed, undoubtedly,\r\n     but being little more than a thin folio pamphlet devoid of\r\n     _typographical_ embellishment--it has been thought by some\r\n     hardly fair to say this of a press which brought out so many\r\n     works characterized by magnitude and various elegance. B.B.]\r\n\r\nTo say that I was not gratified by the perusal of it would be a\r\nconfession contrary to the truth; but to say how ardently I\r\nanticipated an amplification of the subject, how eagerly I looked\r\nforward to a number of curious, apposite, and amusing anecdotes, and\r\nfound them not therein, is an avowal of which I need not fear the\r\nrashness, when the known talents of the detector of Stern's\r\nplagiarisms[4] are considered. I will not, however, disguise to you\r\nthat I read it with uniform delight, and that I rose from the perusal\r\nwith a keener appetite for\r\n\r\n     \"The small, rare volume, black with tarnished gold.\"\r\n\r\n     _Dr. Ferriar's Ep._ v. 138.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 4: In the fourth volume of the Transactions of the\r\n     Manchester Literary Society, part iv., p. 45-87, will be\r\n     found a most ingenious and amusing Essay, entitled\r\n     \"_Comments on Sterne_,\" which excited a good deal of\r\n     interest at the time of its publication. This discovery may\r\n     be considered, in some measure, as the result of the\r\n     BIBLIOMANIA. In my edition of Sir Thomas More's Utopia, a\r\n     suggestion is thrown out that even Burton may have been an\r\n     imitator of Boisatuau [Transcriber's Note: Boiastuau]: see\r\n     vol. II. 143.]\r\n\r\nWhoever undertakes to write down the follies which grow out of an\r\nexcessive attachment to any particular pursuit, be that pursuit\r\nhorses,[5] hawks, dogs, guns, snuff boxes,[6] old china, coins, or\r\nrusty armour, may be thought to have little consulted the best means\r\nof ensuring success for his labours, when he adopts the dull vehicle\r\nof _Prose_ for the commnication [Transcriber's Note: communication] of\r\nhis ideas not considering that from _Poetry_ ten thousand bright\r\nscintillations are struck off, which please and convince while they\r\nattract and astonish. Thus when Pope talks of allotting for\r\n\r\n     \"Pembroke[7] Statues, dirty Gods and Coins;\r\n     Rare monkish manuscripts for Hearne[8] alone;\r\n     And books to Mead[9] and butterflies to Sloane,\"[10]\r\n\r\nwhen he says that\r\n\r\n     These Aldus[11] printed, those Du S[=u]eil has bound[12]\r\n\r\nmoreover that\r\n\r\n     For Locke or Milton[13] 'tis in vain to look;\r\n     These shelves admit not any modern book;\r\n\r\nhe not only seems to illustrate the propriety of the foregoing\r\nremark, by shewing the immense superiority of verse to prose, in\r\nridiculing reigning absurdities, but he seems to have had a pretty\r\nstrong foresight of the BIBLIOMANIA which rages at the present day.\r\nHowever, as the ancients tell us that a Poet cannot be a\r\n_manufactured_ creature, and as I have not the smallest pretensions\r\nto the \"rhyming art,\" [although in former times[14] I did venture to\r\ndabble with it] I must of necessity have recourse to _Prose_; and, at\r\nthe same time, to your candour and forbearance in perusing the pages\r\nwhich ensue.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 5: It may be taken for granted that the first book\r\n     in this country which excited a passion for the _Sports of\r\n     the field_ was Dame Juliana Berners, or Barnes's, work, on\r\n     _Hunting and Hawking_, printed at St. Alban's, in the year\r\n     1486; of which Lord Spencer's copy is, I believe, the only\r\n     perfect one known. It was formerly the Poet Mason's, and is\r\n     mentioned in the quarto edition of Hoccleve's Poems, p. 19,\r\n     1786. See too Bibl. Mason. Pt. iv. No. 153. Whether the\r\n     forementioned worthy lady was really the author of the work\r\n     has been questioned.

In spite of Gibbon's unmerciful critique\r\n     [_Posthumous Works_, vol. II. 711.], the productions of this\r\n     modest, erudite, and indefatigable antiquary are rising in\r\n     price proportionably to their worth. If he had only edited\r\n     the _Collectanea_ and _Itinerary_ of his favourite Leland,\r\n     he would have stood on high ground in the department of\r\n     literature and antiquities; but his other and numerous works\r\n     place him on a much loftier eminence. Of these, the present\r\n     is not the place to make mention; suffice it to say that,\r\n     for copies of his works, on LARGE PAPER, which the author\r\n     used to advertise as selling for 7_s._ or 10_s._, or about\r\n     which placards, to the same effect, used to be stuck on the\r\n     walls of the colleges,--these very copies are now sometimes\r\n     sold for more than the like number of guineas! It is amusing\r\n     to observe that the lapse of a few years only has caused\r\n     such a rise in the article of HEARNE; and that the Peter\r\n     Langtoft on large paper, which at Rowe Mores's sale [Bibl.\r\n     Mores. No. 2191.] was purchased for £1. 2_s._ produced at\r\n     a late sale, [A.D. 1808] £37! A complete list of Hearne's\r\n     Pieces will be found at the end of his Life, printed with\r\n     Leland's, &c., at the Clarendon Press, in 1772, 8vo. Of\r\n     these the \"_Acta Apostolorum_, Gr. Lat;\" and \"_Aluredi\r\n     Beverlacensis Annales_,\" are, I believe, the scarcest. It is\r\n     wonderful to think how this amiable and excellent man\r\n     persevered \"through evil report and good report,\" in\r\n     illustrating the antiquities of his country. To the very\r\n     last he appears to have been molested; and among his\r\n     persecutors, the learned editor of Josephus and Dionysius\r\n     Halicarnasseus, Dr. Hudson, must be ranked, to the disgrace\r\n     of himself and the party which he espoused. \"Hearne was\r\n     buried in the church yard of St. Peter's (at Oxford) in the\r\n     East, where is erected over his remains, a tomb, with an\r\n     inscription written by himself,\r\n\r\n          Amicitiæ Ergo.\r\n          Here lyeth the Body of\r\n          THOMAS HEARNE, M.A.\r\n          Who studied and preserved\r\n          Antiquities.\r\n          He dyed June 10, 1735.\r\n          Aged 57 years.\r\n          Deut. xxxii: 7.\r\n          Remember the days of old;\r\n          consider the years\r\n          of many generations;\r\n          ask thy Father\r\n          and he will shew thee;\r\n          thy elders\r\n          and they will tell thee.\r\n          Job. viii. 8, 9, 10.\r\n          Enquire I pray thee.\"\r\n\r\n          _Life of Hearne_, p. 34.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 9: Of Dr. MEAD and his Library a particular\r\n     account is given in the following pages.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 10: For this distinguished character consult\r\n     Nichols's _Anecdotes of Bowyer_, 550, note*; which, however,\r\n     relates entirely to his ordinary habits and modes of life.\r\n     His magnificent collection of Natural Curiosities and MSS.\r\n     is now in the British Museum.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 11: The annals of the Aldine Press have had ample\r\n     justice done to them in the beautiful and accurate work\r\n     published by Renouard, under the title of \"_Annales de\r\n     L'Imprimerie des Alde_,\" in two vols., 8vo. 1804.

In 1707 were published, in the Philosophical\r\n     Transactions, his Proposals for a General History of\r\n     Printing.\"--Bowyer and Nichols's _Origin of Printing_, p.\r\n     164, 189, note.\r\n\r\n     It has been my fortune (whether good or bad remains to be\r\n     proved) not only to transcribe the slender memorial of\r\n     Printing in the Philosophical Transactions, drawn up by\r\n     Wanley for Bagford, but to wade through _forty-two_ folio\r\n     volumes, in which Bagford's materials for a History of\r\n     Printing are incorporated, in the British Museum: and from\r\n     these, I think I have furnished myself with a pretty fair\r\n     idea of the said Bagford. He was the most hungry and\r\n     rapacious of all book and print collectors; and, in his\r\n     ravages, spared neither the most delicate nor costly\r\n     specimens. His eyes and his mouth seem to have been always\r\n     open to express his astonishment at, sometimes, the most\r\n     common and contemptible productions; and his paper in the\r\n     Philosophical Transactions betrays such simplicity and\r\n     ignorance that one is astonished how my Lord Oxford and the\r\n     learned Bishop of Ely could have employed so credulous a\r\n     bibliographical forager. A modern collector and lover of\r\n     _perfect_ copies will witness, with shuddering, among\r\n     Bagford's immense collection of Title Pages, in the Museum,\r\n     the frontispieces of the Complutensian Polyglot, and\r\n     Chauncy's History of Hertfordshire, torn out to illustrate a\r\n     History of Printing. His enthusiasm, however, carried him\r\n     through a great deal of laborious toil; and he supplied, in\r\n     some measure, by this qualification, the want of other\r\n     attainments. His whole mind was devoted to book-hunting; and\r\n     his integrity and diligence probably made his employers\r\n     overlook his many failings. His hand-writing is scarcely\r\n     legible, and his orthography is still more wretched; but if\r\n     he was ignorant, he was humble, zealous, and grateful; and\r\n     he has certainly done something towards the accomplishment\r\n     of that desirable object, an accurate General History of\r\n     Printing. In my edition of _Ames's Typographical\r\n     Antiquities_, I shall give an analysis of Bagford's papers,\r\n     with a specimen or two of his composition.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 16: For an eloquent account of this disorder\r\n     consult the letters of Dr. Mosely inserted in the Morning\r\n     Herald of last year. I have always been surprised, and a\r\n     little vexed, that these animated pieces of composition\r\n     should be relished and praised by every one--but _the\r\n     Faculty_!]\r\n\r\nLet us enquire, therefore, into the origin and tendency of the\r\nBIBLIOMANIA.\r\n\r\nIn this enquiry I purpose considering the subject under three points\r\nof view: I. THE HISTORY OF THE DISEASE; or an account of the eminent\r\nmen who have fallen victims to it: II. THE NATURE, OR SYMPTOMS OF THE\r\nDISEASE: and III. THE PROBABLE MEANS OF ITS CURE. We are to consider,\r\nthen,\r\n\r\n1. THE HISTORY OF THE DISEASE. In treating of the history of this\r\ndisease, it will be found to have been attended with this remarkable\r\ncircumstance; namely, that it has almost uniformly confined its\r\nattacks to the _male_ sex, and, among these, to people in the higher\r\nand middling classes of society, while the artificer, labourer, and\r\npeasant have escaped wholly uninjured. It has raged chiefly in\r\npalaces, castles, halls, and gay mansions; and those things which in\r\ngeneral are supposed not to be inimical to health, such as\r\ncleanliness, spaciousness, and splendour, are only so many inducements\r\ntowards the introduction and propagation of the BIBLIOMANIA! What\r\nrenders it particularly formidable is that it rages in all seasons of\r\nthe year, and at all periods of human existence. The emotions of\r\nfriendship or of love are weakened or subdued as old age advances; but\r\nthe influence of this passion, or rather disease, admits of no\r\nmitigation: \"it grows with our growth, and strengthens with our\r\nstrength;\" and is oft-times\r\n\r\n     ----The ruling passion strong in death.[17]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 17: The writings of the Roman philologers seem to\r\n     bear evidence of this fact. Seneca, when an old man, says\r\n     that, \"if you are fond of books, you will escape the ennui\r\n     of life; you will neither sigh for evening, disgusted with\r\n     the occupations of the day--nor will you live dissatisfied\r\n     with yourself, or unprofitable to others.\" _De\r\n     Tranquilitate_, ch. 3. Cicero has positively told us that\r\n     \"study is the food of youth, and the amusement of old age.\"\r\n     _Orat. pro Archia_. The younger Pliny was a downright\r\n     Bibliomaniac. \"I am quite transported and comforted,\" says\r\n     he, \"in the midst of my books: they give a zest to the\r\n     happiest, and assuage the anguish of the bitterest, moments\r\n     of existence! Therefore, whether distracted by the cares or\r\n     the losses of my family, or my friends, I fly to my library\r\n     as the only refuge in distress: here I learn to bear\r\n     adversity with fortitude.\" _Epist._ lib. viii. cap. 19. But\r\n     consult Cicero _De Senectute_. All these treatises afford\r\n     abundant proof of the hopelessness of cure in cases of the\r\n     Bibliomania.]\r\n\r\nWe will now, my dear Sir, begin \"making out the catalogue\" of victims\r\nto the BIBLIOMANIA! The first eminent character who appears to have\r\nbeen infected with this disease was RICHARD DE BURY, one of the tutors\r\nof Edward III., and afterwards Bishop of Durham; a man who has been\r\nuniformly praised for the variety of his erudition, and the\r\nintenseness of his ardour in book-collecting.[18] I discover no other\r\nnotorious example of the fatality of the BIBLIOMANIA until the time of\r\nHenry VII.; when the monarch himself may be considered as having added\r\nto the number. Although our venerable typographer, Caxton, lauds and\r\nmagnifies, with equal sincerity, the whole line of British Kings, from\r\nEdward IV. to Henry VII. [under whose patronage he would seem, in some\r\nmeasure, to have carried on his printing business], yet, of all these\r\nmonarchs, the latter alone was so unfortunate as to fall a victim to\r\nthis disease. His library must have been a magnificent one, if we may\r\njudge from the splendid specimens of it which now remain.[19] It would\r\nappear, too, that, about this time, the BIBLIOMANIA was increased by\r\nthe introduction of foreign printed books; and it is not very\r\nimprobable that a portion of Henry's immense wealth was devoted\r\ntowards the purchase of VELLUM copies, which were now beginning to be\r\npublished by the great typographical triumvirate, Verard, Eustace, and\r\nPigouchet.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 18: It may be expected that I should notice a few\r\n     book-lovers, and probably BIBLIOMANIACS, previously to the\r\n     time of Richard De Bury; but so little is known with\r\n     accuracy of Johannes Scotus Erigena, and his patron Charles\r\n     the Bald, King of France, or of the book tête-a-têtes they\r\n     used to have together--so little, also, of Nennius, Bede,\r\n     and Alfred [although the monasteries at this period, from\r\n     the evidence of Sir William Dugdale, in the first volume of\r\n     the Monasticon were \"opulently endowed,\"--inter alia, I\r\n     should hope, with magnificent MSS. on vellum, bound in\r\n     velvet, and embossed with gold and silver], or the\r\n     illustrious writers in the Norman period, and the fine books\r\n     which were in the abbey of Croyland--so little is known of\r\n     book-collectors, previously to the 14th century, that I\r\n     thought it the most prudent and safe way to begin with the\r\n     above excellent prelate.\r\n\r\n     RICHARD DE BURY was the friend and correspondent of\r\n     Petrarch; and is said by Mons. de Sade, in his Memoires pour\r\n     la vie de Petrarque, \"to have done in England what Petrarch\r\n     did all his life in France, Italy, and Germany, towards the\r\n     discovery of MSS. of the best ancient writers, and making\r\n     copies of them under his own superintendence.\" His passion\r\n     for book-collecting was unbounded [\"vir ardentis ingenii,\"\r\n     says Petrarch of him]; and in order to excite the same\r\n     ardour in his countrymen, or rather to propagate the disease\r\n     of the BIBLIOMANIA with all his might, he composed a\r\n     bibliographical work under the title of _Philobiblion_;\r\n     concerning the first edition of which, printed at Spires in\r\n     1483, Clement (tom. v. 142) has a long gossiping account;\r\n     and Morhof tells us that it is \"rarissima et in paucorum\r\n     manibus versatur.\" It was reprinted in Paris in 1500, 4to.,\r\n     by the elder Ascensius, and frequently in the subsequent\r\n     century, but the best editions of it are those by Goldastus\r\n     in 1674, 8vo., and Hummius in 1703. Morhof observes that,\r\n     \"however De Bury's work savours of the rudeness of the age,\r\n     it is rather elegantly written, and many things are well\r\n     said in it relating to Bibliothecism.\" _Polyhist. Literar._\r\n     vol. i. 187, edit. 1747.\r\n\r\n     For further particulars concerning De Bury, read Bale,\r\n     Wharton, Cave, and Godwin's Episcopal Biography. He left\r\n     behind him a fine library of MSS. which he bequeathed to\r\n     Durham, now Trinity, College, Oxford.\r\n\r\n     It may be worth the antiquary's notice, that, in consequence\r\n     (I suppose) of this amiable prelate's exertions, \"in every\r\n     convent was a noble library and a great: and every friar,\r\n     that had state in school, such as they be now, hath AN HUGH\r\n     LIBRARY.\" See the curious Sermon of the Archbishop of\r\n     Armagh, Nov. 8, 1387, in Trevisa's works among the _Harleian\r\n     MSS._ No. 1900. Whether these Friars, thus affected with\r\n     the frensy of book-collecting, ever visited the \"old\r\n     chapelle at the Est End of the church of S. Saink\r\n     [Berkshire], whither of late time resorted in pilgrimage\r\n     many folkes for the disease of _madness_,\" [see Leland's\r\n     _Itinerary_, vol. ii. 29, edit. 1770] I have not been able,\r\n     after the most diligent investigation, to ascertain.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 19: The British Museum contains a great number of\r\n     books which bear the royal stamp of Henry VII.'s arms. Some\r\n     of these printed by Verard, UPON VELLUM, are magnificent\r\n     memorials of a library, the dispersion of which is for ever\r\n     to be regretted. As Henry VIII. knew nothing of, and cared\r\n     less for, fine books, it is not very improbable that some of\r\n     the choicest volumes belonging to the late king were\r\n     presented to Cardinal Wolsey.]\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Henry VIII., I should suppose that the Earl of\r\nSurrey[20] and Sir Thomas Wyatt were a little attached to\r\nbook-collecting; and that Dean Colet[21] and his friend Sir Thomas\r\nMore and Erasmus were downright Bibliomaniacs. There can be little\r\ndoubt but that neither the great LELAND[22] nor his Biographer\r\nBale,[23] were able to escape the contagion; and that, in the ensuing\r\nperiod, Rogar [Transcriber's Note: Roger] Ascham became notorious for\r\nthe Book-disease. He purchased probably, during his travels\r\nabroad[24] many a fine copy of the Greek and Latin Classics, from\r\nwhich he read to his illustrious pupils, Lady Jane Grey, and Queen\r\nElizabeth: but whether he made use of an _Editio Princeps_, or a\r\n_Large paper copy_, I have hitherto not been lucky enough to discover.\r\nThis learned character died in the vigour of life, and in the bloom\r\nof reputation: and, as I suspect, in consequence of the\r\nBIBLIOMANIA--for he was always collecting books, and always studying\r\nthem. His \"Schoolmaster\" is a work which can only perish with our\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 20: The EARL of SURREY and SIR THOMAS WYATT were\r\n     among the first who taught their countrymen to be charmed\r\n     with the elegance and copiousness of their own language. How\r\n     effectually they accomplished this laudable object, will be\r\n     seen from the forthcoming beautiful and complete edition of\r\n     their works by the Rev. Dr. Nott.[B]]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote B: It fell to the lot of the printer of this\r\n     volume, during his apprenticeship to his father, to correct\r\n     the press of nearly the whole of Dr. Nott's labours, which\r\n     were completed, after several years of toil, when in the\r\n     extensive conflagration of the printing-office at Bolt\r\n     Court, Fleet-street, in 1819, all but _two_ copies were\r\n     totally destroyed!]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 21: COLET, MORE, and ERASMUS [considering the\r\n     latter when he was in England] were _here_ undoubtedly the\r\n     great literary triumvirate of the early part of the 16th\r\n     century. The lives of More and Erasmus are generally read\r\n     and known; but of DEAN COLET it may not be so generally\r\n     known that his ardour for books and for classical literature\r\n     was keen, and insatiable; that, in the foundation of ST.\r\n     PAUL'S SCHOOL, he has left behind a name which entitles him\r\n     to rank in the foremost of those who have fallen victims to\r\n     the BIBLIOMANIA. How anxiously does he seem to have watched\r\n     the progress, and pushed the sale, of his friend Erasmus's\r\n     first edition of the Greek Testament! \"Quod scribis de Novo\r\n     Testamento intelligo. Et libri _novæ editionis tuæ hic avide\r\n     emuntur et passim leguntur_!\" The entire epistle (which may\r\n     be seen in Dr. Knight's dry Life of Colet, p. 315) is\r\n     devoted to an account of Erasmus's publications. \"I am\r\n     really astonished, my dear Erasmus [does he exclaim], at the\r\n     fruitfulness of your talents; that, without any fixed\r\n     residence, and with a precarious and limited income, you\r\n     contrive to publish so many and such excellent works.\"\r\n     Adverting to the distracted state of Germany at this period,\r\n     and to the wish of his friend to live secluded and\r\n     unmolested, he observes--\"As to the tranquil retirement\r\n     which you sigh for, be assured that you have my sincere\r\n     wishes for its rendering you as happy and composed as you\r\n     can wish it. Your age and erudition entitle you to such a\r\n     retreat. I fondly hope, indeed, that you will choose this\r\n     country for it, and come and live amongst us, whose\r\n     disposition you know, and whose friendship you have proved.\"\r\n\r\n     There is hardly a more curious picture of the custom of the\r\n     times, relating to the education of boys, than the Dean's\r\n     own Statutes for the regulation of St. Paul's School, which\r\n     he had founded. These shew, too, the _popular books_ then\r\n     read by the learned. \"The children shall come unto the\r\n     School in the morning at seven of the clock, both winter and\r\n     summer, and tarry there until eleven; and return against one\r\n     of the clock, and depart at five, &c. In the school, no time\r\n     in the year, they shall use tallow candle in no wise, but\r\n     _only wax candle_, at the costs of their friends. Also I\r\n     will they bring no meat nor drink, nor bottle, nor use in\r\n     the school no breakfasts, nor drinkings, in the time of\r\n     learning, in no wise, &c. I will they use no cockfightings,\r\n     nor riding about of victory, nor disputing at Saint\r\n     Bartholomew, which is but foolish babbling and loss of\r\n     time.\" The master is then restricted, under the penalty of\r\n     40 shillings, from granting the boys a holiday, or \"remedy,\"\r\n     [play-day,] as it is here called \"except the King, an\r\n     Archbishop, or a Bishop, present in his own person in the\r\n     school, desire it.\" The studies for the lads were,\r\n     \"Erasmus's Copia & Institutum Christiani Hominis (composed\r\n     at the Dean's request) Lactantius, Prudentius, Juvencus,\r\n     Proba and Sedulius, and Baptista Mantuanus, and such other\r\n     as shall be thought convenient and most to purpose unto the\r\n     true Latin speech: all barbary, all corruption, all Latin\r\n     adulterate, which ignorant blind fools brought into this\r\n     world, and with the same hath distained and poisoned the old\r\n     Latin speech, and the _veray_ Roman tongue, which in the\r\n     time of Tully and Sallust and Virgil and Terence was used--I\r\n     say that filthiness, and all such abusion, which the later\r\n     blind world brought in, which more rather may be called\r\n     _Bloterature_ that [Transcriber's Note: than] _Literature_,\r\n     I utterly banish and exclude out of this school.\" _Life of\r\n     Knight's Colet_, 362-4.\r\n\r\n     What was to be expected, but that boys, thus educated, would\r\n     hereafter fall victims to the BIBLIOMANIA?]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 22: The history of this great men [Transcriber's\r\n     Note: man], and of his literary labours, is most\r\n     interesting. He was a pupil of William Lilly, the first\r\n     head-master of St. Paul's School; and, by the kindness and\r\n     liberality of a Mr. Myles, he afterwards received the\r\n     advantage of a College education, and was supplied with\r\n     money in order to travel abroad, and make such collections\r\n     as he should deem necessary for the great work which even\r\n     then seemed to dawn upon his young and ardent mind. Leland\r\n     endeavoured to requite the kindness of his benefactor by an\r\n     elegant copy of Latin verses, in which he warmly expatiates\r\n     on the generosity of his patron, and acknowledges that his\r\n     acquaintance with the _Almæ Matres_ [for he was of both\r\n     Universities] was entirely the result of such beneficence.\r\n     While he resided on the continent, he was admitted into the\r\n     society of the most eminent Greek and Latin Scholars, and\r\n     could probably number among his correspondents the\r\n     illustrious names of Budæus, Erasmus, the Stephani, Faber\r\n     and Turnebus. Here, too, he cultivated his natural taste for\r\n     poetry; and from inspecting the fine BOOKS which the Italian\r\n     and French presses had produced, as well as fired by the\r\n     love of Grecian learning, which had fled, on the sacking of\r\n     Constantinople, to take shelter in the academic bowers of\r\n     the Medici, he seems to have matured his plans for carrying\r\n     into effect the great work which had now taken full\r\n     possession of his mind. He returned to England, resolved to\r\n     institute an inquiry into the state of the LIBRARIES,\r\n     Antiquities, Records and Writings then in existence. Having\r\n     entered into holy orders, and obtained preferment at the\r\n     express interposition of the King, (Henry VIII.), he was\r\n     appointed his Antiquary and Library Keeper, and a royal\r\n     commission was issued in which Leland was directed to search\r\n     after \"ENGLAND'S ANTIQUITIES, and peruse the LIBRARIES of\r\n     all Cathedrals, Abbies, Priories, Colleges, etc., as also\r\n     all the places wherein Records, Writings, and Secrets of\r\n     Antiquity were reposited.\" \"Before Leland's time,\" says\r\n     Hearne, in the Preface to the Itinerary, \"all the literary\r\n     monuments of Antiquity were totally disregarded; and\r\n     Students of Germany, apprised of this culpable indifference,\r\n     were suffered to enter our libraries unmolested, and to cut\r\n     out of the books deposited there whatever passages they\r\n     thought proper--which they afterwards published as relics of\r\n     the ancient literature of their own country.\"\r\n\r\n     Leland was occupied, without intermission, in this immense\r\n     undertaking, for the space of six years; and, on its\r\n     completion, he hastened to the metropolis to lay at the feet\r\n     of his Sovereign the result of his researches. This was\r\n     presented to Henry under the title of A NEW YEAR'S GIFT; and\r\n     was first published by Bale in 1549, 8vo. \"Being inflamed,\"\r\n     says the author, \"with a love to see thoroughly all those\r\n     parts of your opulent and ample realm, in so much that all\r\n     my other occupations intermitted, I have so travelled in\r\n     your dominions, both by the sea coasts and the middle parts,\r\n     sparing neither labour nor costs, by the space of six years\r\n     past, that there is neither cape nor bay, haven, creek, or\r\n     pier, river, or confluence of rivers, breeches, wastes,\r\n     lakes, moors, fenny waters, mountains, vallies, heaths,\r\n     forests, chases, woods, cities, burghes, castles, principal\r\n     manor places, monasteries and colleges, but I have seen\r\n     them; and noted, in so doing, a whole world of things very\r\n     memorable.\" Leland moreover tells his Majesty--that \"By his\r\n     laborious journey and costly enterprise, he had conserved\r\n     many good authors, the which otherwise had been like to have\r\n     perished; of the which, part remained in the royal palaces,\r\n     part also in his own custody, &c.\"\r\n\r\n     As Leland was engaged six years in this literary tour, so he\r\n     was occupied for a no less period of time in digesting and\r\n     arranging the prodigious number of MSS. he had collected.\r\n     But he sunk beneath the immensity of the task! The want of\r\n     amanuenses, and of other attentions and comforts, seems to\r\n     have deeply affected him; in this melancholy state, he wrote\r\n     to Archbishop Cranmer a Latin epistle, in verse, of which\r\n     the following is the commencement--very forcibly describing\r\n     his situation and anguish of mind.\r\n\r\n          Est congesta mihi domi supellex\r\n          Ingens, aurea, nobilis, venusta\r\n          Qua totus studeo Britanniarum\r\n          Vero reddere gloriam nitori.\r\n          Sed fortuna meis noverca coeptis\r\n          Jam felicibus invidet maligna.\r\n          Quare, ne pereant brevi vel hora\r\n          Multarum mihi noctium labores\r\n          Omnes----\r\n          CRANMERE, eximium decus piorum!\r\n          Implorare tuam benignitatem\r\n          Cogor.\r\n\r\n     The result was that Leland lost his senses; and, after\r\n     lingering two years in a state of total derangement, he died\r\n     on the 18th of April, 1552. \"Prôh tristes rerum humanarum\r\n     vices! prôh viri optimi deplorandam infelicissimamque\r\n     sortem!\" exclaims Dr. Smith, in his preface to Camden's\r\n     Life, 1691, 4to.\r\n\r\n     The precious and voluminous MSS. of Leland were doomed to\r\n     suffer a fate scarcely less pitiable than that of their\r\n     owner. After being pilfered by some, and garbled by others,\r\n     they served to replenish the pages of Stow, Lambard, Camden,\r\n     Burton, Dugdale, and many other antiquaries and historians.\r\n     Polydore Virgil, who had stolen from them pretty freely, had\r\n     the insolence to abuse Leland's memory--calling him \"a vain\r\n     glorious man;\" but what shall we say to this flippant\r\n     egotist? who, according to Caius's testimony [_De Antiq.\r\n     Cantab. head. lib._ 1.] \"to prevent a discovery of the many\r\n     errors of his own History of England, collected and burnt a\r\n     greater number of ancient histories and manuscripts than\r\n     would have loaded a waggon.\" The imperfect remains of\r\n     Leland's MSS. are now deposited in the Bodleian Library, and\r\n     in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n     Upon the whole, it must be acknowledged that Leland is a\r\n     melancholy, as well as illustrious, example of the influence\r\n     of the BIBLIOMANIA!]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 23: In spite of BALE'S coarseness, positiveness,\r\n     and severity, he has done much towards the cause of\r\n     learning; and, perhaps, towards the propagation of the\r\n     disease under discussion. His regard for Leland does him\r\n     great honour; and although his plays are miserably dull,\r\n     notwithstanding the high prices which the original editions\r\n     of them bear, (vide ex. gr. Cat. Steevens, No. 1221;\r\n     which was sold for £12 12_s._ See also the reprints in the\r\n     Harleian Miscellany) the lover of literary antiquities must\r\n     not forget that his \"_Scriptores Britanniæ_\" are yet quoted\r\n     with satisfaction by some of the most respectable writers of\r\n     the day. That he wanted delicacy of feeling, and\r\n     impartiality of investigation, must be admitted; but a\r\n     certain rough honesty and prompt benevolence which he had\r\n     about him compensated for a multitude of offences. The\r\n     abhorrence with which he speaks of the dilapidation of some\r\n     of our old libraries must endear his memory to every honest\r\n     bibliographer: \"Never (says he) had we been offended for the\r\n     loss of our LIBRARIES, being so many in number, and in so\r\n     desolate places for the more part, if the chief monuments\r\n     and most notable works of our excellent writers had been\r\n     reserved. If there had been in every shire of England, but\r\n     one SOLEMPNE LIBRARY, to the preservation of those noble\r\n     works, and preferment of good learning in our posterity, it\r\n     had been yet somewhat. But to destroy all without\r\n     consideration, is, and will be, unto England for ever, a\r\n     most horrible infamy among the grave seniors of other\r\n     nations. A great number of them which purchased those\r\n     superstitious mansions, reserved of those library-books,\r\n     some to serve the _jakes_, some to scour their candlesticks,\r\n     and some to rub their boots: some they sold to the grocers\r\n     and soap-sellers; some they sent over sea to the\r\n     book-binders, not in small number, but at times whole ships\r\n     full, to the wondering of the foreign nations. Yea, the\r\n     Universities of this realm are not all clear of this\r\n     detestable fact. But cursed is that belly which seeketh to\r\n     be fed with such ungodly gain, and shameth his natural\r\n     country. I know a merchant man, which shall at this time be\r\n     nameless, that _bought the contents of two noble libraries\r\n     for forty shillings price_; a shame it is to be spoken! This\r\n     stuff hath he occupied in the stead of grey paper, by the\r\n     space of more than ten years, and yet he hath store enough\r\n     for as many year to come!\" Bale's Preface to Leland's\r\n     \"_Laboryouse journey_, &c.\" Emprented at London by John\r\n     Bale.

Again: \"Hieronimus Wolfius, that\r\n     translated Demosthenes and Isocrates, is in this town. I am\r\n     well acquainted with him, and have brought him twice to my\r\n     Lord's to dinner. He looks very simple. He telleth me that\r\n     one Borrheus, that hath written well upon Aristot. priorum,\r\n     &c., even now is printing goodly commentaries upon\r\n     Aristotle's Rhetoric.

It is to be\r\ntaken for granted that Queen Elizabeth was not exempt from it; and\r\nthat her great Secretary,[25] Cecil, sympathised with her! In regard\r\nto Elizabeth, her _Prayer-Book_[26] is quite evidence sufficient for\r\nme that she found the BIBLIOMANIA irresistible! During her reign, how\r\nvast and how frightful were the ravages of the Book-madness! If we are\r\nto credit Laneham's celebrated Letter, it had extended far into the\r\ncountry, and infected some of the worthy inhabitants of Coventry; for\r\none \"Captain Cox,[27] by profession a mason, and that right skilful,\"\r\nhad \"as fair a library of sciences, and as many goodly monuments both\r\nin Prose and Poetry, and at afternoon could talk as much without book,\r\nas any Innholder betwixt Brentford and Bagshot, what degree soever he\r\nbe!\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 25: It is a question which requires more time for\r\n     the solution than I am able to spare, whether CECIL'S name\r\n     stands more frequently at the head of a Dedication, in a\r\n     printed book, or of State Papers and other political\r\n     documents in MS. He was a wonderful man; but a little\r\n     infected--as I suspect--with the BOOK-DISEASE.\r\n\r\n          ----Famous Cicill, treasurer of the land,\r\n          Whose wisedom, counsell, skill of Princes state\r\n          The world admires----\r\n          The house itselfe doth shewe the owners wit,\r\n          And may for bewtie, state, and every thing,\r\n          Compared be with most within the land.\r\n\r\n          _Tale of Two Swannes_, 1590. 4_to._\r\n\r\n     I have never yet been able to ascertain whether the owner's\r\n     attachment towards VELLUM, or LARGE PAPER, Copies was the\r\n     more vehement!]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 26: Perhaps this conclusion is too precipitate.\r\n     But whoever looks at Elizabeth's portrait, on her bended\r\n     knees, struck off on the reverse of the title page to her\r\n     prayer book (first printed in 1565) may suppose that the\r\n     Queen thought the addition of her own portrait would be no\r\n     mean decoration to the work. Every page is adorned with\r\n     borders, engraved on wood, of the most spirited execution:\r\n     representing, amongst other subjects, \"The Dance of Death.\"\r\n     My copy is the reprint of 1608--in high preservation. I have\r\n     no doubt that there was a _presentation_ copy printed UPON\r\n     VELLUM; but in what cabinet does this precious gem now\r\n     slumber?]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 27: Laneham gives a splendid list of Romances and\r\n     Old Ballads possessed by this said CAPTAIN COX; and tells\r\n     us, moreover, that \"he had them all at his fingers ends.\"\r\n     Among the ballads we find \"Broom broom on Hil; So Wo is me\r\n     begon twlly lo; Over a Whinny Meg; Hey ding a ding; Bony\r\n     lass upon Green; My bony on gave me a bek; By a bank as I\r\n     lay; and two more he had fair wrapt up in parchment, and\r\n     bound with a whip cord.\" Edit. 1784, p. 36-7-8. Ritson, in\r\n     his Historical Essay on _Scottish Song_, speaks of some of\r\n     these, with a zest, as if he longed to untie the \"whip-cord\"\r\n     packet.]\r\n\r\nWhile the country was thus giving proofs of the prevalence of this\r\ndisorder, the two Harringtons (especially the younger)[28] and the\r\nillustrious Spenser[29] were unfortunately seized with it in the\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 28: SIR JOHN HARRINGTON, knt. Sir John, and his\r\n     father John Harrington, were very considerable literary\r\n     characters in the 16th century; and whoever has been\r\n     fortunate enough to read through Mr. Park's new edition of\r\n     the _Nugæ Antiquæ_, 1804, 8vo., will meet with numerous\r\n     instances in which the son displays considerable\r\n     bibliographical knowledge--especially in _Italian_\r\n     literature; Harrington and Spenser seem to have been the\r\n     Matthias and Roscoe of the day. I make no doubt but that the\r\n     former was as thoroughly acquainted with the _vera edizione_\r\n     of the Giuntæ edition of Boccaccio's Decamerone, 1527, 4to.,\r\n     as either Haym, Orlandi, or Bandini. Paterson, with all his\r\n     skill, was mistaken in this article when he catalogued\r\n     Croft's books. See Bibl. Crofts. No. 3976: his true\r\n     edition was knocked down for 6_s._!!!]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 29: Spenser's general acquaintance with Italian\r\n     literature has received the best illustration in Mr. Todd's\r\n     Variorum edition of the poet's works; where the reader will\r\n     find, in the notes, a constant succession of anecdotes of,\r\n     and references to, the state of anterior and contemporaneous\r\n     literature, foreign and domestic.]\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century, from the death of Elizabeth to the\r\ncommencement of Anne's reign, it seems to have made considerable\r\nhavoc; yet, such was our blindness to it that we scrupled not to\r\nengage in overtures for the purchase of Isaac Vossius's[30] fine\r\nlibrary, enriched with many treasures from the Queen of Sweden's,\r\nwhich this versatile genius scrupled not to pillage without confession\r\nor apology. During this century our great reasoners and philosophers\r\nbegan to be in motion; and, like the fumes of tobacco, which drive the\r\nconcealed and clotted insects from the interior to the extremity of\r\nthe leaves, the infectious particles of the BIBLIOMANIA set a thousand\r\nbusy brains a-thinking, and produced ten thousand capricious works,\r\nwhich, over-shadowed by the majestic remains of Bacon, Locke, and\r\nBoyle, perished for want of air, and warmth, and moisture.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 30: \"The story is extant, and written in very\r\n     choice _French_.\" Consult Chauffepié's _Supplement to\r\n     Bayle's Dictionary_, vol. iv. p. 621. note Q. Vossius's\r\n     library was magnificent and extensive. The University of\r\n     Leyden offered not less than 36,000 florins for it. _Idem._\r\n     p. 631.]\r\n\r\nThe reign of Queen Anne was not exempt from the influence of this\r\ndisease; for during this period, Maittaire[31] began to lay the\r\nfoundation of his extensive library, and to publish some\r\nbibliographical works which may be thought to have rather increased,\r\nthan diminished, its force. Meanwhile, Harley[32] Earl of Oxford\r\nwatched its progress with an anxious eye; and although he might have\r\nlearnt experience from the fatal examples of R. Smith,[33] and T.\r\nBaker,[34] and the more recent ones of Thomas Rawlinson,[35]\r\nBridges,[36] and Collins,[37] yet he seemed resolved to brave and to\r\nbaffle it; but, like his predecessors, he was suddenly crushed within\r\nthe gripe of the demon, and fell one of the most splendid of his\r\nvictims. Even the unrivalled medical skill of Mead[38] could save\r\nneither his friend nor himself. The Doctor survived his Lordship about\r\ntwelve years; dying of the complaint called the BIBLIOMANIA! He left\r\nbehind an illustrious character; sufficient to flatter and soothe\r\nthose who may tread in his footsteps, and fall victims to a similar\r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 31: Of MICHAEL MAITTAIRE I have given a brief\r\n     sketch in my Introduction to the _Greek and Latin Classics_,\r\n     vol. I, 148. Mr. Beloe, in the 3rd vol. of his _Anecdotes of\r\n     Literature_, p. ix., has described his merits with justice.\r\n     The principal value of Maittaire's _Annales Typographici_\r\n     consists in a great deal of curious matter detailed in the\r\n     notes; but the absence of the \"lucidus ordo\" renders the\r\n     perusal of these fatiguing and dissatisfactory. The author\r\n     brought a full and well-informed mind to the task he\r\n     undertook--but he wanted taste and precision in the\r\n     arrangement of his materials. The eye wanders over a vast\r\n     indigested mass; and information, when it is to be acquired\r\n     with excessive toil, is, comparatively, seldom acquired.\r\n     Panzer has adopted an infinitely better plan, on the model\r\n     of Orlandi; and, if his materials had been _printed_ with\r\n     the same beauty with which they appear to have been\r\n     composed, and his annals had descended to as late a period\r\n     as those of Maittaire, his work must have made us,\r\n     eventually, forget that of his predecessor. The\r\n     bibliographer is, no doubt, aware that of Maittaire's first\r\n     volume there are two editions. Why the author did not\r\n     reprint, in the second edition (1733), the facsimile of the\r\n     epigram and epistle of LASCAR prefixed to the edition of the\r\n     Anthology 1496, and the disquisition concerning the ancient\r\n     editions of Quintilian (both of which were in the first\r\n     edition of 1719), is absolutely inexplicable. Maittaire was\r\n     sharply attacked for this absurdity, in the \"Catalogus\r\n     Auctorum,\" of the \"_Annus Tertius Sæcularis Inv. Art.\r\n     Topog._\" Harlem, 1741, 8vo. p. 11. \"Rara certe Librum\r\n     augendi methodus (exclaims the author)! Satis patet auctorem\r\n     hoc eo fecisse consilio, ut et primæ et secundæ Libri sive\r\n     editioni pretium suum constaret, et una æque ac altera\r\n     Lectoribus necessaria esset.\"\r\n\r\n     The catalogue of Maittaire's library [1748, 2 parts, 8vo.],\r\n     which affords ample proof of the BIBLIOMANIA of its\r\n     collector, is exceedingly scarce. A good copy of it, even\r\n     unpriced, is worth a guinea: it was originally sold for 4\r\n     shillings; and was drawn up by Maittaire himself.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 32: In a periodical publication called \"_The\r\n     Director_,\" to which I contributed under the article of\r\n     \"_Bibliographiana_\" (and of which the printer of this work,\r\n     Mr. William Savage, is now the sole publisher), there was\r\n     rather a minute analysis of the famous library of HARLEY,\r\n     EARL OF OXFORD: a library which seems not only to have\r\n     revived, but eclipsed, the splendour of the Roman one formed\r\n     by Lucullus. The following is an abridgement of this\r\n     analysis:\r\n\r\n                                                          VOLUMES.\r\n\r\n     1.

Pamphlets--_Four Hundred Thousand_!\r\n\r\n     Mr. Gough says, these books \"filled thirteen handsome\r\n     chambers, and two long galleries.\" Osborne the bookseller\r\n     purchased them for £13,000: a sum little more than two\r\n     thirds of the price of the binding, as paid by Lord Oxford.\r\n     The bookseller was accused of injustice and parsimony; but\r\n     the low prices which he afterwards affixed to the articles,\r\n     and the tardiness of their sale, are sufficient refutations\r\n     of this charge. Osborne opened his shop for the inspection\r\n     of the books on Tuesday the 14th of February, 1744; for fear\r\n     \"of the curiosity of the spectators, before the sale,\r\n     producing disorder in the disposition of the books.\" The\r\n     dispersion of the HARLEIAN COLLECTION is a blot in the\r\n     literary annals of our country: had there then been such a\r\n     Speaker, and such a spirit in the House of Commons, as we\r\n     now possess, the volumes of Harley would have been reposing\r\n     with the MARBLES OF TOWNLEY!]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 33: \"BIBLIOTHECA SMITHIANA: sive Catalogus\r\n     Librorum in quavis facultate insigniorum, quos in usum suum\r\n     et Bibliothecæ ornamentum multo ære sibi comparavit vir\r\n     clarissimus doctissimusque D.

I recommend the collector of curious and\r\n     valuable catalogues to lay hold upon the present one (of\r\n     which a more particular description will be given in another\r\n     work) whenever it comes in his way. The address \"To the\r\n     Reader,\" in which we are told that \"this so much celebrated,\r\n     so often desired, so long expected, library is now exposed\r\n     to sale,\" gives a very interesting account of the owner.\r\n     Inter alia, we are informed that Mr. Smith \"was as\r\n     constantly known every day to walk his rounds through the\r\n     shops, as to sit down to his meals, &c.;\" and that \"while\r\n     others were forming arms, and new-modelling kingdoms, _his_\r\n     great ambition was to become master of a good book.\"\r\n\r\n     The catalogue itself justifies every thing said in\r\n     commendation of the collector of the library. The\r\n     arrangement is good; the books, in almost all departments of\r\n     literature, foreign and domestic, valuable and curious; and\r\n     among the English ones I have found some of the rarest\r\n     Caxtons to refer to in my edition of Ames. What would Mr.\r\n     Bindley, or Mr. Malone, or Mr. Douce, give to have the\r\n     _creaming_ of such a collection of \"Bundles of Stitcht Books\r\n     and Pamphlets,\" as extends from page 370 to 395 of this\r\n     catalogue! But alas! while the Bibliographer exults in, or\r\n     hopes for, the possession of such treasures, the\r\n     physiologist discovers therein fresh causes of disease, and\r\n     the philanthropist mourns over the ravages of the\r\n     BIBLIOMANIA!]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 34: Consult Masters's \"_Memoirs of the Life and\r\n     Writings of the late Rev._ THOMAS BAKER,\" Camb. 1864, 8vo.\r\n     Let any person examine the catalogue of _Forty-two_ folio\r\n     volumes of \"MS. collections by Mr. Baker,\" (as given at the\r\n     end of this piece of biography) and reconcile himself, if he\r\n     can, to the supposition that the said Mr. Baker did not fall\r\n     a victim to the _Book-disease_! For some cause, I do not now\r\n     recollect what, Baker took his name off the books of St.\r\n     John's College, Cambridge, to which he belonged; but such\r\n     was his attachment to the place, and more especially to the\r\n     library, that he spent a great portion of the ensuing twenty\r\n     years of his life within the precincts of the same:\r\n     frequently comforted and refreshed, no doubt, by the sight\r\n     of the magnificent LARGE PAPER copies of Walton and Castell,\r\n     and of Cranmer's Bible UPON VELLUM!]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 35: This THOMAS RAWLINSON, who is introduced in\r\n     the Tatler under the name _Tom Folio_, was a very\r\n     extraordinary character, and most desperately addicted to\r\n     book-hunting. Because his own house was not large enough, he\r\n     hired _London House_, in Aldersgate Street, for the\r\n     reception of his library; and here he used to regale himself\r\n     with the sight and the scent of innumerable black letter\r\n     volumes, arranged in \"sable garb,\" and stowed perhaps \"three\r\n     deep,\" from the bottom to the top of his house.

His curiosities, whether\r\n     books, or coins, or pictures, were freely laid open to the\r\n     public; and the enterprising student, and experienced\r\n     antiquary, alike found amusement and a courteous reception.\r\n     He was known to all foreigners of intellectual distinction,\r\n     and corresponded both with the artisan and the potentate.\r\n     The great patron of literature, and the leader of his\r\n     profession (which he practised with a success unknown\r\n     before), it was hardly possible for unbefriended merit, if\r\n     properly introduced to him, to depart unrewarded. The\r\n     clergy, and in general, all men of learning, received his\r\n     advice _gratuitously_: and his doors were open every morning\r\n     to the _most indigent_, whom he frequently assisted with\r\n     money. Although his income, from his professional practice,\r\n     was very considerable, he died by no means a rich man--so\r\n     large were the sums which he devoted to the encouragement of\r\n     literature and the fine arts!\r\n\r\n     The sale of Dr. Mead's _books_ commenced on the 18th of\r\n     November, 1754, and again on the 7th of April, 1755: lasting\r\n     together 57 days. The sale of the _prints_ and _drawings_\r\n     continued 14 nights. The _gems_, _bronzes_, _busts_, and\r\n     _antiquities_, 8 days.\r\n\r\n     His books produced          £5496  15  0\r\n       Pictures                   3417  11  0\r\n       Prints and drawings        1908  14  0\r\n       Coins and medals           1977  17  0\r\n       Antiquities                3246  15  0\r\n                               --------------\r\n     Amount of all the sales   £16,047  12  0\r\n\r\n     It would be difficult to mention, within a moderate compass,\r\n     all the rare and curious articles which his library\r\n     contained--but the following are too conspicuous to be\r\n     passed over. The _Spira Virgil_ of 1470, _Pfintzing's\r\n     Tewrkdrancs_, 1527, _Brandt's Stultifera Navis_, 1498, and\r\n     the _Aldine Petrarch_ of 1501, ALL UPON VELLUM. The large\r\n     paper _Olivet's Cicero_ was purchased by Dr. Askew for £14\r\n     14_s._ and was sold again at his sale for £36 15_s._ The\r\n     King of France bought the editio princeps of _Pliny Senr._\r\n     for £11 11_s._; and Mr. Willock, a bookseller, bought the\r\n     magnificently illuminated _Pliny by Jenson_ of 1472, for £18\r\n     18_s._: of which Maittaire has said so many fine things. The\r\n     _French_ books, and all the works upon the _Fine Arts_, were\r\n     of the first rarity, and value, and bound in a sumptuous\r\n     manner. Winstanley's _Prospects of Audley End_ brought £50.\r\n     An amusing account of some of the pictures will be found in\r\n     Mr. Beloe's \"_Anecdotes of Literature and Scarce Books_,\"\r\n     vol. i. 166. 71. But consult also _Nichol's Anecdotes of\r\n     Bowyer_, p. 225, &c. Of the catalogue of Dr. Mead's books\r\n     there were only six copies printed on LARGE PAPER. See Bibl.\r\n     Lort, no. 1149.]\r\n\r\nThe years 1755-6 were singularly remarkable for the mortality excited\r\nby the BIBLIOMANIA; and the well known names of Folkes,[39] and\r\nRawlinson,[40] might have supplied a modern Holbein a hint for the\r\nintroduction of a new subject in the \"_Dance of Death_.\" The close of\r\nGeorge the Second's reign witnessed another instance of the fatality\r\nof this disease. Henley[41] \"bawled till he was hoarse\" against the\r\ncruelty of its attack; while his library has informed posterity how\r\nseverely and how mortally he suffered from it.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 39: \"A Catalogue of the entire and valuable\r\n     library of MARTIN FOLKES, ESQ., President of the Royal\r\n     Society, and member of the Royal Academy of Sciences at\r\n     Paris, lately deceased; which will be sold by auction by\r\n     Samuel Baker, at his house, in York Street, Covent Garden.\r\n     To begin on Monday, February 2, 1756, and to continue for\r\n     forty days successively (Sundays excepted).

The works on\r\n     natural history, coins, medals, and inscriptions, and on the\r\n     fine arts in general, formed the most valuable\r\n     department--those in the Greek, Latin and English classics,\r\n     were comparatively of inferior importance. It is a great\r\n     pity the catalogue was not better digested; or the books\r\n     classed according to the nature of their contents.\r\n\r\n     The following prices, for some of the more rare and\r\n     interesting articles, will amuse a bibliographer of the\r\n     present day. The chronicles of Fabian, Hall, and Grafton,\r\n     did not altogether bring quite £2: though the copies are\r\n     described as perfect and fair. There seems to have been a\r\n     fine set of Sir Wm. Dugdale's Works (Nos. 3074-81) in 13\r\n     vols. which, collectively, produced about 30 guineas.\r\n\r\n     In _Spanish literature_, the history of South America, By\r\n     Don Juan and Ant. di Ulloa, Madr. fol. in 5 vols., was sold\r\n     for £5: a fine large paper copy of the description of the\r\n     Monastery of St. Lorenzo, and the Escorial, Madr. 1657,\r\n     brought £1 2_s._: de Lastanosa's Spanish Medals, Huesca,\r\n     fol. 1645, £2 2_s._\r\n\r\n     In _English_, the first edition of Shakespeare, 1623, which\r\n     is now what a French bibliographer would say \"presque\r\n     introuvable,\" produced the sum of £3 3_s._; and Fuller's\r\n     Worthies, 18_s._!\r\n\r\n     _Fine Arts, Antiquities, and Voyages._ Sandrart's works, in\r\n     9 folio volumes (of which a fine perfect copy is now rarely\r\n     to be met with, and of very great value) were sold for £13\r\n     13_s._ only: Desgodetz Roman edifices, Paris, 1682, £4\r\n     10_s._: Galleria Giustiniano, 2 vols., fol. £13 13_s._ Le\r\n     Brun's Voyages in Muscovy, &c., in large paper, £4 4_s._ De\r\n     Rossi's Raccolta de Statue, &c.

Those in the Hunter and Cracherode collections\r\n     are greatly superior, and would each bring more than double\r\n     the price.\r\n\r\n     From a priced copy of the sale catalogue, in my possession,\r\n     I find that the amount of the sale, consisting of 5126\r\n     articles, was £3091 5_s._\r\n\r\n     The _Prints and Drawings_ of Mr. Folkes occupied a sale of 8\r\n     days; and his _pictures_, _gems_, _coins_, and _mathematical\r\n     instruments_, of five days.\r\n\r\n     Mr. MARTIN FOLKES may justly be ranked among the most\r\n     useful, as well as splendid, literary characters of which\r\n     this country can boast. He appears to have imbibed, at a\r\n     very early age, an extreme passion for science and\r\n     literature; and to have distinguished himself so much at the\r\n     University of Cambridge, under the able tuition of Dr.\r\n     Laughton, that, in his 23rd year, he was admitted a Fellow\r\n     of the Royal Society. About two years afterwards he was\r\n     chosen one of the council, and rose, in gradual succession,\r\n     to the chair of the presidentship, which he filled with a\r\n     credit and celebrity that has since never been surpassed. On\r\n     this occasion he was told by Dr. Jurin, the Secretary, who\r\n     dedicated to him the 34th vol. of the Transactions, that\r\n     \"the greatest man that ever lived (Sir Isaac Newton) singled\r\n     him out to fill the chair, and to preside in the society,\r\n     when he himself was so frequently prevented by\r\n     indisposition: and that it was sufficient to say of him that\r\n     he was _Sir Isaac's friend_.\"\r\n\r\n     Within a few years after this, he was elected President of\r\n     the Society of Antiquaries. Two situations, the filling of\r\n     which may be considered as the _ne plus ultra_ of literary\r\n     distinction. Mr. Folkes travelled abroad, with his family,\r\n     about two years and a half, visiting the cities of Rome,\r\n     Florence, and Venice--where he was noticed by almost every\r\n     person of rank and reputation, and whence he brought away\r\n     many a valuable article to enrich his own collection. He was\r\n     born in the year 1690, and died of a second stroke of the\r\n     palsy, under which he languished for three years, in 1754.\r\n     Dr. Birch has drawn a very just and interesting character of\r\n     this eminent man, which may be found in Nichol's _Anecdotes\r\n     of Bowyer_, 562. 7. Mr. Edwards, the late ornithologist, has\r\n     described him in a simple, but appropriate, manner. \"He\r\n     seemed,\" says he, \"to have attained to universal knowledge;\r\n     for, in the many opportunities I have had of being in his\r\n     company, almost every part of science has happened to be the\r\n     subject of discourse, all of which he handled as an adept.\r\n     He was a man of great politeness in his manners, free from\r\n     all pedantry and pride, and, in every respect, the real\r\n     unaffected fine gentleman.\"]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 40: \"BIBLIOTHECA RAWLINSONIANA, sive Catalogus\r\n     Librorum Richardi Rawlinson, LL.D.

On\r\n     examining a priced catalogue of it, which now lies before\r\n     me, I have not found any higher sum offered for a work than\r\n     £4 1_s._ for a collection of fine prints, by Aldegrave (No.\r\n     9405). The Greek and Latin classics, of which there were few\r\n     _Editiones Principes_, or on _large paper_, brought the\r\n     usual sums given at that period. The old English\r\n     black-lettered books, which were pretty thickly scattered\r\n     throughout the collection, were sold for exceedingly low\r\n     prices--if the copies were perfect.

Hence it will be seen that this was not the age\r\n     of curious research into the productions of our ancestors.\r\n     Shakspeare had not then appeared in a proper _Variorum\r\n     edition_. Theobald, and Pope, and Warburton, had not\r\n     investigated the black-letter lore of ancient English\r\n     writers, for the illustration of their favourite author.\r\n     This was reserved for Farmer, for Steevens, for Malone, for\r\n     Chalmers, Reed and Douce: and it is expressly to these\r\n     latter gentlemen (for Johnson and Hanmer were very sparing,\r\n     or very shy, of the black letter), that we are indebted for\r\n     the present spirit of research into the works of our\r\n     ancestors.\r\n\r\n     The sale of the books lasted 50 days. There was a second\r\n     sale of pamphlets, books of prints, &c., in the following\r\n     year, which lasted 10 days; and this was immediately\r\n     succeeded by a sale of the Doctor's single prints and\r\n     drawings, which continued 8 days.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 41: This gentleman's library, not so remarkable\r\n     for the black letter as for whimsical publications, was sold\r\n     by auction, by Samuel Paterson, [the earliest sale in which\r\n     I find this well known book-auctioneer engaged] in June,\r\n     1759, and the three ensuing evenings.

The name\r\nof Dormer[42] will remind you of the small but choice library which\r\naffords such a melancholy proof of its owners' fate; while the more\r\nsplendid examples of Smith[43] and West[44] serve to shew the\r\nincreased ravages of a disease, which seemed to threaten the lives of\r\nall, into whose ears (like those of \"Visto,\") some demon had\r\n\"whispered\" the sound of \"TASTE.\" These three striking instances of\r\nthe fatality of the Bibliomania occurred--the first in the year 1764;\r\nand the latter in 1773. The following year witnessed the sale of the\r\nFletewode[45] library; so that nothing but despair and havoc appeared\r\nto move in the train of this pestiferous malady. In the year 1775 died\r\nthe famous Dr. Anthony Askew, another illustrious victim to the\r\nBibliomania. Those who recollect the zeal and scholarship of this\r\ngreat book-collector, and the precious gems with which his library[46]\r\nwas stored from the cabinets of De Boze and Gaignat, as well as of\r\nMead and Folkes, cannot but sigh with grief of heart on the thought\r\nof such a victim! How ardently, and how kindly [as I remember to have\r\nheard his friend Dr. Burges say], would Askew unfold his glittering\r\nstores--open the magnificent folio, or the shining duodecimo, UPON\r\nVELLUM, embossed and fast held together with golden knobs and silver\r\nclasps! How carefully would he unroll the curious MS.--decipher the\r\nhalf effaced characters--and then, casting an eye of ecstacy over the\r\nshelves upon which similar treasures were lodged, exult in the\r\nglittering prospect before him! But death--who, as Horace tells us,\r\nraps equally at the palaces of kings and cottages of peasants, made\r\nno scruple to exercise the knocker of the Doctor's door, and sent, as\r\nhis avant-courier, THIS DEPLORABLE MANIA! It appeared; and even Askew,\r\nwith all his skill in medicine and books, fell lifeless before\r\nit--bewailed, as he was beloved and respected!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 42: \"A Catalogue of the genuine and elegant\r\n     Library of the late Sir C.C.

The number of articles did not exceed 3082, and of\r\n     volumes, probably not 7000. The catalogue is neatly printed,\r\n     and copies of it on _large paper_ are exceedingly scarce.\r\n     Among the most curious and valuable articles were those\r\n     numbered 599, 604, 2249, 2590; from no. 2680, to the end,\r\n     was a choice collection of Italian and Spanish books.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 43: In the year 1755 was published at Venice,\r\n     printed by J.B.

These occupy 519 pages, marked with\r\n     the Roman numerals; after which are 66 pages, numbered in\r\n     the same manner, of \"addenda et corrigenda.\" The most\r\n     valuable part of the volume is \"The Prefaces and Epistles\r\n     prefixed to those works in the Library which were printed in\r\n     the 15th century:\" these occupy 348 pages. A Catalogue, (in\r\n     three pages) of the Names of the illustrious Men mentioned\r\n     in these prefaces, &c., closes the book.\r\n\r\n     It would be superfluous to mention to bibliographers the\r\n     rare articles contained in this collection, which are so\r\n     generally known and so justly appreciated. They consist\r\n     chiefly of early editions of _Italian_, _Greek_, and _Latin\r\n     classics_; and of many copies of both printed UPON VELLUM.\r\n     The library, so rich in these articles, was, however,\r\n     defective in English Literature and Antiquities. There was\r\n     scarcely any thing of Shakspeare or Dugdale.\r\n\r\n     On the death of Mr. Smith in 1772, his collection was sold\r\n     in 1773, 8vo., by Baker and Leigh; and the books were\r\n     announced to the public, as being \"in the finest\r\n     preservation, and consisting of the very best and scarcest\r\n     editions of the Latin, Italian, and French authors, from the\r\n     invention of printing; with manuscripts and missals, upon\r\n     vellum, finely illuminated.\" A glance upon the prices for\r\n     which most of these fine books were sold made Mr. Cuthell\r\n     exclaim, in my hearing, that \"_they were given away_.\" On\r\n     these occasions, one cannot help now and then wishing, with\r\n     father Evander,\r\n\r\n          \"O mihi præteritos referat si Jupiter annos!\"\r\n\r\n     On comparing Pasquali's, with the sale, catalogue, it will\r\n     be obvious that a great number of rare and valuable articles\r\n     was disposed of before the books came to public auction.\r\n     Indeed it is known that his present MAJESTY enriched his\r\n     magnificent collection with many of the Consul's _first\r\n     editions_, and _vellum copies_, during the life of the\r\n     latter. The sale continued thirteen days only; and on the\r\n     last day were sold all the English books in the\r\n     _black-letter_. Some of these are rather curious.\r\n\r\n     Of CONSUL SMITH I am unable to present the lover of VIRTU\r\n     with any particulars more acceptable than the following.\r\n     Pasquali (whose Latin preface is curious enough--abounding\r\n     with as many interrogatories as Hamlet's soliloquies) has\r\n     told us that \"as the Consul himself was distinguished for\r\n     his politeness, talents, and prudence, so was his house for\r\n     splendid and elegant decorations. You might there view, says\r\n     he, the most beautifully painted pictures, and exquisite\r\n     ornaments, whether gems, vases, or engravings. In short, the\r\n     whole furniture was so brilliant and classical that you\r\n     admired at once the magnificence and judgment of the owner.\"\r\n     He tells us, a little further, that he had frequently\r\n     solicited the Consul to print a catalogue of his books;\r\n     which proposition his modesty at first induced him to\r\n     reject; but, afterwards, his liberality, to comply with. He\r\n     then observes that, \"in the compilation of the catalogue, he\r\n     has studied brevity as much as it was consistent with\r\n     perspicuity; and that he was once desirous of stating the\r\n     _value_ and _price_ of the books, but was dissuaded from it\r\n     by the advice of the more experienced, and by the singular\r\n     modesty of the Collector.\"\r\n\r\n     It must be confessed that Pasquali has executed his task\r\n     well, and that the catalogue ranks among the most valuable,\r\n     as well as rare, books of the kind.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 44: \"BIBLIOTHECA WESTIANA; A catalogue of the\r\n     curious and truly valuable library of the late James West,\r\n     Esq., President of the Royal Society, deceased, &c.\r\n     Including the works of CAXTON, LETTOU, MACHLINIA, the\r\n     anonymous ST.

Digested by Samuel Paterson,\"\r\n     1773, 8vo.\r\n\r\n     ANALYSIS OF THE CATALOGUE.\r\n\r\n     1. _Volumes of Miscellaneous Tracts._\r\n\r\n     These volumes extend from No. 148 to 200, from 915 to\r\n     992, from 1201 to 1330, and from No. 1401 to 1480.\r\n\r\n     2. _Divinity._\r\n\r\n     In the whole, 560 articles; probably about 1200 volumes;\r\n     some of them exceedingly scarce and valuable.\r\n\r\n     3. _Education, Languages, Criticism, Classics, Dictionaries,\r\n     Catalogues of Libraries, &c._\r\n\r\n     There were about 700 volumes in these departments. The\r\n     catalogues of English books, from that of Maunsell, in 1595,\r\n     to the latest before Mr. West's time, were very complete.\r\n     The treatises on education and translations of the ancient\r\n     classics comprehended a curious and uncommon collection. The\r\n     Greek and Latin classics were rather select than rare.\r\n\r\n     4. _English Poetry, Romance, and Miscellanies._\r\n\r\n     This interesting part of the collection comprehended about\r\n     355 articles, or probably about 750 volumes: and if the\r\n     singularly rare and curious books which may be found _under\r\n     these heads alone_ were now concentrated in one library, the\r\n     owner of them might safely demand 4000 guineas for such a\r\n     treasure.\r\n\r\n     5. _Philosophy, Mathematics, Inventions, Agriculture and\r\n     Horticulture, Medicine, Cookery, Surgery, etc._\r\n\r\n     Two hundred and forty articles, or about 560 volumes.\r\n\r\n     6. _Chemistry, Natural History, Astrology, Sorcery,\r\n     Gigantology._\r\n\r\n     Probably not more than 100 volumes.\r\n\r\n     7. _History and Antiquities._\r\n\r\n     This comprehended a great number of curious and valuable\r\n     productions, relating both to foreign and domestic\r\n     transactions.\r\n\r\n     8. _Heraldry and Genealogy._\r\n\r\n     A great number of curious and scarce articles may be found\r\n     under these heads.\r\n\r\n     9. _Ancient Legends and Chronicles._\r\n\r\n     To the English antiquary, few departments of literature are\r\n     more interesting that these. Mr. West seems to have paid\r\n     particular attention to them, and to have enriched his\r\n     library with many articles of this description, of the\r\n     rarest occurrence. The lovers of Caxton, Fabian, Hardyng,\r\n     Hall, Grafton, and Holinshed, may be highly gratified by\r\n     inspecting the various editions of these old chroniclers. I\r\n     entreat the diligent bibliographer to examine the first\r\n     eight articles of page 209 of the catalogue. Alas, when will\r\n     all these again come under the hammer at one sale?!\r\n\r\n     10. _Topography._\r\n\r\n     Even to a veteran, like the late Mr. GOUGH, such a\r\n     collection as may be found from p. 217 to p. 239 of this\r\n     catalogue, would be considered a first-rate acquisition. I\r\n     am aware that the gothic wainscot, and stained glass\r\n     windows, of _Enfield Study_ enshrined a still more exquisite\r\n     topographical collection! But we are improved since the days\r\n     of Mr. West; and every body knows to _whom_ these\r\n     improvements are, in a great measure, to be attributed. When\r\n     I call to mind the author of '_British Topography_' and\r\n     '_Sepulchral Monuments_,' I am not insensible to the taste,\r\n     diligence, and erudition of the \"par nobile fratrum,\" who\r\n     have gratified us with the '_Environs of London_,' '_Roman\r\n     Remains_,' and the first two volumes of '_Magna Britannia_!'\r\n\r\n     The preceding is to be considered as a very general, and\r\n     therefore superficial, analysis of the catalogue of Mr.\r\n     West's library; copies of it, with the sums for which the\r\n     books were sold, are now found with difficulty, and bring a\r\n     considerable price.

The Catalogue is uncommon.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 46: I am now arrived, pursuing my chronological\r\n     arrangement, at a very important period in the annals of\r\n     book-sales. The name and collection of Dr. ASKEW are so well\r\n     known in the bibliographical world that the reader need not\r\n     be detained with laboured commendations on either: in the\r\n     present place, however, it would be a cruel disappointment\r\n     not to say a word or two by way of _preface_ or _prologue_.\r\n\r\n     Dr. ANTHONY ASKEW had eminently distinguished himself by a\r\n     refined taste, a sound knowledge, and an indefatigable\r\n     research relating to every thing connected with Grecian and\r\n     Roman literature. It was to be expected, even during his\r\n     life, as he was possessed of sufficient means to gratify\r\n     himself with what was rare, curious, and beautiful in\r\n     literature and the fine arts, that the public would, one\r\n     day, be benefited by such pursuits: especially as he had\r\n     expressed a wish that his treasures might be unreservedly\r\n     submitted to sale, after his decease. In this wish the\r\n     Doctor was not singular. Many eminent collectors had\r\n     indulged it before him: and, to my knowledge, many modern\r\n     ones still indulge it. Accordingly on the death of Dr.\r\n     Askew, in 1774, appeared, in the ensuing year, a catalogue\r\n     of his books for sale, by Messrs. Baker and Leigh, under the\r\n     following title:\r\n\r\n     \"BIBLIOTHECA ASKEVIANA, sive Catalogus Librorum Rarissimorum\r\n     ANTONII ASKEW, M.D., quorum Auctio fiet apud S. Baker et G.\r\n     Leigh, in Vico dicto _York Street, Covent Garden_, Londini.\r\n     _Die Lunæ_, 13 _Februarii_, MDCCLXXV, et in undeviginti\r\n     sequentes dies.\" A few copies were struck off on large\r\n     paper.\r\n\r\n     We are told by the compiler of the catalogue that it was\r\n     thought unnecessary to say much with respect to this Library\r\n     of the late Dr. Anthony Askew, as the Collector and\r\n     Collection were so well known in almost all parts of Europe.\r\n     Afterwards it is observed that \"The books in general are in\r\n     very fine condition, many of them bound in morocco, and\r\n     Russia leather, with gilt leaves.\" \"To give a particular\r\n     account,\" continues the Compiler, \"of the _many scarce\r\n     editions_ of books in this Catalogue would be almost\r\n     endless, therefore the _first editions_ of the Classics, and\r\n     some _extremely rare books_ are chiefly noticed. The\r\n     catalogue, without any doubt, contains the best, rarest, and\r\n     most valuable collection of GREEK and LATIN BOOKS that were\r\n     ever sold in England.\" This account is not overcharged. The\r\n     collection, in regard to Greek and Roman literature, was\r\n     _unique_ in its day.\r\n\r\n     The late worthy and learned Mr. M. CRACHERODE, whose library\r\n     now forms one of the most splendid acquisitions of the\r\n     British Museum, and whose _bequest_ of it will immortalize\r\n     his memory, was also among the \"Emptores literarii\" at this\r\n     renowned sale. He had enriched his collection with many\r\n     _Exemplar Askevianum_; and, in his latter days, used to\r\n     elevate his hands and eyes, and exclaim against the prices\r\n     _now_ offered for EDITIONES PRINCIPES!\r\n\r\n     The fact is, Dr. Askew's sale has been considered a sort of\r\n     _æra_ in bibliography. Since that period, rare and curious\r\n     books in Greek and Latin literature have been greedily\r\n     sought after, and obtained at most extravagant prices. It is\r\n     very well for a veteran in bibliography, as was Mr.\r\n     Cracherode, or as are Mr. Wodhull and Dr. Gosset, whose\r\n     collections were formed in the days of Gaignat, Askew, Duke\r\n     de la Valliere, and Lamoignon--it is very well for such\r\n     gentlemen to declaim against _modern prices_! But what is to\r\n     be done? Books grow scarcer every day, and the love of\r\n     literature, and of possessing rare and interesting works,\r\n     increases in an equal ratio. Hungry bibliographers meet, at\r\n     sales, with well furnished purses, and are resolved upon\r\n     sumptuous fare. Thus the hammer _vibrates_, after a bidding\r\n     of _Forty pounds_, where formerly it used regularly to\r\n     _fall_ at _Four_!\r\n\r\n     But we lose sight of Dr. Askew's _rare editions_, and _large\r\n     paper copies_.

The\r\n     ink is of the finest lustre, and the whole typographical\r\n     arrangement may be considered a master-piece of printing.\r\n     Lord Oxford told Dr. Mead that he gave 100 guineas for this\r\n     very copy.]\r\n\r\nAfter this melancholy event, one would have thought that future\r\n_Virtuosi_ would have barricadoed their doors, and fumigated their\r\nchambers, to keep out such a pest;--but how few are they who profit by\r\nexperience, even when dearly obtained! The subsequent history of the\r\ndisease is a striking proof of the truth of this remark; for the\r\nmadness of book-collecting rather increased--and the work of death\r\nstill went on. In the year 1776 died John Ratcliffe[47] another, and\r\na very singular, instance of the fatality of the BIBLIOMANIA. If he\r\nhad contented himself with his former occupation, and frequented the\r\nbutter and cheese, instead of the book, market--if he could have\r\n_fancied himself_ in a brown peruke, and Russian apron, instead of an\r\nembroidered waistcoat, velvet breeches, and flowing perriwig, he\r\nmight, perhaps, have enjoyed greater longevity; but, infatuated by the\r\nCaxtons and Wynkyn De Wordes of Fletewode and of West, he fell into\r\nthe snare; and the more he struggled to disentangle himself, the more\r\ncertainly did he become a prey to the disease.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 47: BIBLIOTHECA RATCLIFFIANA; or, \"A Catalogue of\r\n     the elegant and truly valuable Library of JOHN RATCLIFFE,\r\n     Esq. late of Bermondsey, deceased.

Catalogues be to me in\r\n     the compilation of a certain _magnum opus_!\r\n\r\n     The memory of such a man ought to be dear to the\r\n     \"_black-lettered dogs_\" of the present day; for he had\r\n     [mirabile dictu!] _upwards of_ THIRTY CAXTONS!\r\n\r\n     If I might hazard a comparison between Mr. James West's and\r\n     Mr. John Ratcliffe's collections, I should say that the\r\n     former was more extensive, the latter more curious: Mr.\r\n     West's, like a magnificent _champagne_, executed by the hand\r\n     of Claude or Both, and enclosing mountains, and meadows, and\r\n     streams, presented to the eye of the beholder a scene at\r\n     once extensive, luxuriant, and fruitful: Mr. Ratcliffe's,\r\n     like one of those delicious pieces of scenery, touched by\r\n     the pencil of Rysdael or Hobbima, exhibited to the\r\n     beholder's eye a spot equally interesting, but less varied\r\n     and extensive. The sweeping foliage and rich pasture of the\r\n     former could not, perhaps, afford greater gratification than\r\n     did the thatched cottage, abrupt declivities, and gushing\r\n     streams of the latter. To change the metaphor--Mr. West's\r\n     was a magnificent repository, Mr. Ratcliffe's a choice\r\n     cabinet of gems.]\r\n\r\nThirty years have been considered by Addison (somewhere in his\r\nSpectator) as a pretty accurate period for the passing away of one\r\ngeneration and the coming on of another. We have brought down our\r\nresearches to within a similar period of the present times; but, as\r\nAddison has not made out the proofs of such assertion, and as many of\r\nthe relatives and friends of those who have fallen victims to the\r\nBIBLIOMANIA, since the days of Ratcliffe, may yet be alive; moreover,\r\nas it is the part of humanity not to tear open wounds which have been\r\njust closed, or awaken painful sensibilities which have been well nigh\r\nlaid to rest; so, my dear Sir, in giving you a further account of this\r\nfatal disorder, I deem it the most prudent method _not to expatiate_\r\nupon the subsequent examples of its mortality. We can only mourn over\r\nsuch names as BEAUCLERK, CROFTS, PEARSON, LORT, MASON, FARMER,\r\nSTEEVENS, WOODHOUSE, BRAND, and REED! and fondly hope that the list\r\nmay not be increased by those of living characters!\r\n\r\nWe are, in the SECOND place, to describe the SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE.\r\n\r\nThe ingenious Peignot, in the first volume of his 'Dictionnaire\r\nBibliologie,' p. 51, defines the Bibliomania[48] to be \"a passion for\r\npossessing books; not so much to be instructed by them, as to gratify\r\nthe eye by looking on them. He who is affected by this mania knows\r\nbooks only by their titles and dates, and is rather seduced by the\r\nexterior than interior\"! This is, perhaps, too general and vague a\r\ndefinition to be of much benefit in the knowledge, and consequent\r\nprevention, of the disease: let us, therefore, describe it more\r\ncertainly and intelligibly.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 48: There is a short, but smart and interesting,\r\n     article on this head in Mr. D'Israeli's _Curiosities of\r\n     Literature_, vol. 1. 10. \"Bruyere has touched on this mania\r\n     with humour; of such a collector (one who is fond of superb\r\n     bindings only) says he, as soon as I enter his house, I am\r\n     ready to faint on the stair-case from a strong smell of\r\n     morocco leather. In vain he shows me fine editions, gold\r\n     leaves, Etruscan bindings, &c.--naming them one after\r\n     another, as if he were showing a gallery of pictures!\"\r\n     Lucian has composed a biting invective against an ignorant\r\n     possessor of a vast library. \"One who opens his eyes, with\r\n     an hideous stare, at an old book, and, after turning over\r\n     the pages, chiefly admires the _date_ of its publication.\"]\r\n\r\nSymptoms of this disease are instantly known by a passion for I.\r\n_Large Paper Copies_: II. _Uncut Copies_: III. _Illustrated Copies_:\r\nIV. _Unique Copies_: V. _Copies printed upon Vellum_: VI. _First\r\nEditions_: VII. _True Editions_: VIII. _A general desire for the Black\r\nLetter_. We will describe these symptoms more particularly.\r\n\r\nI. _Large Paper Copies._ These are a certain set or limited number of\r\nthe work printed in a superior manner, both in regard to ink and press\r\nwork, on paper of a larger size, and better quality, than the ordinary\r\ncopies. Their price is enhanced in proportion to their beauty and\r\nrarity. In the note below[49] are specified a few works which have\r\nbeen published in this manner, that the sober collector may avoid\r\napproaching them.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 49: 1. _Lord Bacon's Essays_, 1798, 8vo., of which\r\n     it is said only five copies were struck off on royal folio.\r\n     In Lord Spencer's and the Cracherode, collection I have seen\r\n     a copy of this exquisitely printed book; the text of which,\r\n     surrounded by such an amplitude of margin, in the language\r\n     of Ernesti [see his Critique on Havercamp's Sallust] \"natut\r\n     velut cymba in oceano.\"\r\n\r\n     2. _Twenty Plays of Shakespeare_ published by Steevens from\r\n     the old quarto editions, 1766, 8vo. 6 vols. Of this edition\r\n     there were only twelve copies struck off on large paper. See\r\n     Bibl. Steevens, No. 1312.\r\n\r\n     3. _Dodsley's Collection of Old Plays_, 1780, 8vo., 12 vols.\r\n     only six copies printed on large paper. See Bibl. Woodhouse,\r\n     No. 198.\r\n\r\n     4. _The Grenville Homer._ Græce, 1800. 4to. 4 vols. Fifty\r\n     copies with plates were struck off on large paper, in royal\r\n     quarto. A copy of this kind was purchased at a sale in 1804,\r\n     for £99 15s.\r\n\r\n     5. _Sandford's Genealogical History_, etc. 1707, fol. Mr.\r\n     Arch of Cornhill purchased a copy of this work on large\r\n     paper, at the late sale of Baron Smyth's books, for £46. If\r\n     the largest paper of Clarke's Cæsar be excepted, this is the\r\n     highest priced single volume on large paper, that I just now\r\n     recollect.\r\n\r\n     6. _Hearne's Works_ on large paper.\r\n\r\n     Something relating to Hearne will be found in the note at\r\n     page 7 ante. Here it will be only necessary to observe that\r\n     the Hernëan rage for Large Paper is quite of recent growth,\r\n     but it promises to be giant-like. When the duplicates of a\r\n     part of Mr. Woodhull's library, in 1803, were sold, there\r\n     was a fine set of copies of this kind; but the prices,\r\n     comparatively with those now offered, were extremely\r\n     moderate. Mr. Otridge, the bookseller, told me an amusing\r\n     story of his going down to Liverpool, many years ago, and\r\n     accidentally purchasing from the library of the late Sir\r\n     Thomas Hanmer, a _magnificent set of Large Paper Hearnes_\r\n     for about 40 Guineas. Many of these are now in the choice\r\n     library of his Grace the Duke of Grafton. The copies were\r\n     catalogued as _small_ paper. Was there ever a more provoking\r\n     blunder?!]\r\n\r\nThis[50] symptom of the Bibliomania is, at the present day, both\r\ngeneral and violent, and threatens to extend still more widely. Even\r\nmodern publications are not exempt from its calamitous influence; and\r\nwhen Mr. Miller, the bookseller, told me with what eagerness the large\r\npaper copies of Lord Valentia's Travels were bespoke, and Mr. Evans\r\nshewed me that every similar copy of his new edition of \"Burnett's\r\nHistory of his own Times\" was disposed of, I could not help elevating\r\nmy eyes and hands, in token of commiseration at the prevalence of\r\nthis Symptom of the BIBLIOMANIA!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 50: Analogous to Large Paper Copies are _tall\r\n     Copies_; that is, copies of the work published on the\r\n     ordinary size paper and not much cut down by the binder. The\r\n     want of _margin_ is a serious grievance complained of by\r\n     book-collectors; and when there is a contest of\r\n     margin-measuring, with books never professedly published on\r\n     large paper, the anxiety of each party to have the largest\r\n     copy is better conceived than described! How carefully, and\r\n     how adroitly, are the golden and silver rules then\r\n     exercised!]\r\n\r\nII. _Uncut Copies._ Of all the symptoms of the Bibliomania, this is\r\nprobably the most extraordinary. It may be defined as a passion to\r\npossess books of which the edges have never been sheared by the\r\nbinder's tools. And here, my dear Sir, I find myself walking upon\r\ndoubtful ground;--your UNCUT HEARNES rise up in \"rough majesty\" before\r\nme, and almost \"push me from my stool.\" Indeed, when I look around in\r\nmy book-lined tub, I cannot but be conscious that this symptom of the\r\ndisorder has reached my own threshold; but when it is known that a few\r\nof my bibliographical books are left with the edges uncut _merely to\r\nplease my friends_ (as one must sometimes study their tastes and\r\nappetites as well as one's own), I trust that no very serious\r\nconclusions will be drawn about the probable fatality of my own case.\r\nAs to uncut copies, although their inconvenience [an uncut lexicon to\r\nwit!] and deformity must be acknowledged, and although a rational man\r\ncan want for nothing better than a book _once well bound_, yet we find\r\nthat the extraordinary passion for collecting them not only obtains\r\nwith full force, but is attended with very serious consequences to\r\nthose \"qui n'ont point des pistoles\" (to borrow the language of\r\nClement; vol. vi. p. 36). I dare say an uncut _first Shakspeare_, as\r\nwell as an uncut _first Homer_[51] would produce a little annuity!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 51: \"Un superbe exemplaire de cette édition\r\n     _princeps_ a été vendu, chez M. de Cotte, en 1804, la somme\r\n     de 3601 livres; mais il faut ajouter que cet exemplaire\r\n     très-precieux est de la plus belle conservation; on dirait\r\n     qu'il sort dessous presse. De plus, il est peut-être\r\n     _l'unique dont les marges n'ont pas été rognées ni\r\n     coupées_!\"\r\n\r\n     Peignot's _Curiosités Bibliographiques_, lxv-vi.]\r\n\r\nIII. _Illustrated Copies._ A passion for books illustrated or adorned\r\nwith numerous prints, representing characters or circumstances\r\nmentioned in the work, is a very general and violent symptom of the\r\nBibliomania, which has been known chiefly within the last half\r\ncentury. The origin, or first appearance, of this symptom has been\r\ntraced by some to the publication of Granger's \"Biographical History\r\nof England;\" but whoever will be at the pains of reading the preface\r\nof this work will see that Granger sheltered himself under the\r\nauthorities of Evelyn, Ashmole, and others; and that he alone is not\r\nto be considered as responsible for all the mischief which this\r\npassion for collecting prints has occasioned. Granger, however, was\r\nthe first who introduced it in the form of a treatise, and surely \"in\r\nan evil hour\" was this treatise published--although its amiable author\r\nmust be acquitted of \"malice prepense.\" His History of England[52]\r\nseems to have sounded the tocsin for a general rummage after, and\r\nslaughter of, old prints: venerable philosophers and veteran heroes,\r\nwho had long reposed in unmolested dignity within the magnificent\r\nfolio volumes which recorded their achievements, were instantly\r\ndragged from their peaceful abodes to be inlaid by the side of some\r\nspruce, modern engraving, within an ILLUSTRATED GRANGER! Nor did the\r\nmadness stop here. Illustration was the order of the day; and\r\nShakspeare[53] and Clarendon[54] became the next objects of its\r\nattack. From these it has glanced off in a variety of directions, to\r\nadorn the pages of humbler wights; and the passion, or rather this\r\nsymptom of the Bibliomania,[55] yet rages with undiminished force. If\r\njudiciously[56] treated, it is, of all the symptoms, the least liable\r\nto mischief. To possess a series of well executed portraits of\r\nillustrious men, at different periods of their lives, from blooming\r\nboyhood to phlegmatic old age, is sufficiently amusing[57]; but to\r\npossess _every_ portrait, _bad, indifferent, and unlike_, betrays\r\nsuch a dangerous and alarming symptom as to render the case almost\r\nincurable!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 52: It was first published in two quarto volumes,\r\n     1766; and went through several editions in octavo. The last\r\n     is, I believe, of the date of 1804; to which three\r\n     additional volumes were published by William Noble, in 1806;\r\n     the whole seven volumes form what is called an excellent\r\n     library work.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 53: About two or three years ago there was an\r\n     extraordinary set of prints disposed of, for the\r\n     illustration of Shakspeare, collected by a gentleman in\r\n     Cornwall, with considerable taste and judgment. Lord\r\n     Spencer's beautiful octavo illustrated Shakespeare,\r\n     bequeathed to him by the late Mr. Steevens, has been\r\n     enriched, since it came into the library of its present\r\n     noble possessor, with many a rare and many a beauteous\r\n     specimen of the graphic art.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 54: I have heard of an illustrated Clarendon\r\n     (which was recently in the metropolis), that has been valued\r\n     at 5000 Guineas! \"a good round sum!\"]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 55: One of the most striking and splendid\r\n     instances of the present rage for illustration may be seen\r\n     in Mr. Miller's own copy of the Historical Work of Mr. Fox,\r\n     in two volumes, imperial quarto. Exclusively of a great\r\n     variety of Portraits, it is enriched with the original\r\n     drawing of Mr. Fox's bust from which the print, attached to\r\n     the publication, is taken; and has also many original notes\r\n     and letters by its illustrious author. Mr. Walter Scott's\r\n     edition of Dryden has also received, by the same publisher,\r\n     a similar illustration. It is on large paper, and most\r\n     splendidly bound in blue morocco, containing upwards of 650\r\n     portraits.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 56: The fine copy of Granger, illustrated by the\r\n     late Mr. Bull, is now in the library of the Marquis of Bute,\r\n     at Lutton. It extends to 37 atlas folio volumes, and is a\r\n     repository of almost every rare and beautiful print, which\r\n     the diligence of its late, and the skill, taste, and\r\n     connoisseurship of its present, noble owner have brought\r\n     together.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 57: In the Memoirs of Mr. Thomas Hollis there is a\r\n     series of the portraits of Milton (not executed in the best\r\n     manner) done in this way; and a like series of Pope's\r\n     portraits accompanies the recent edition of the poet's works\r\n     by the Rev. W.L. Bowles.]\r\n\r\nThere is another mode of illustrating copies by which this symptom of\r\nthe Bibliomania may be known: it consists in bringing together, from\r\ndifferent works, [by means of the scissors, or otherwise by\r\ntranscription] every page or paragraph which has any connection with\r\nthe character or subject under discussion. This is a useful and\r\nentertaining mode of illustrating a favourite author; and copies of\r\nworks of this nature, when executed by skilful[58] hands, should be\r\npreserved in public repositories. I almost ridiculed the idea of an\r\nILLUSTRATED CHATTERTON, in this way, till I saw Mr. Haslewood's copy,\r\nin twenty-one volumes, which rivetted me to my seat!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 58: Numerous are the instances of the peculiar use\r\n     and value of copies of this kind, especially to those who\r\n     are engaged in publication, of a similar nature. Oldys's\r\n     interleaved Langbaine is re-echoed in almost every recent\r\n     work connected with the belles-lettres of our country. Oldys\r\n     himself was unrivalled in this method of illustration; if,\r\n     besides his Langbaine, his copy of 'Fuller's Worthies' [once\r\n     Mrs. Steevens's, now Mr. Malone's, See Bibl. Steevens,\r\n     no. 1799] be alone considered! This Oldys was the oddest\r\n     mortal that ever scribbled for bread. Grose, in his _Olio_,\r\n     gives an amusing account of his having \"a number of small\r\n     parchment bags inscribed with the names of the persons whose\r\n     lives he intended to write; into which he put every\r\n     circumstance and anecdote he could collect, and thence drew\r\n     up his history.\" See Noble's _College of Arms_, p. 420.\r\n\r\n     Of illustrated copies in this way, the Suidas of Kuster,\r\n     belonging to the famous D'Orville, is a memorable instance.\r\n     This is now in the Bodleian library. I should suppose that\r\n     one Narcissus Luttrell, in Charles the Second's reign, had a\r\n     number of like illustrated copies. His collection of\r\n     contemporaneous literature must have been immense, as we may\r\n     conclude from the account of it in Mr. Walter Scott's\r\n     Preface to his recent edition of Dryden's works. Luckily for\r\n     this brilliant poet and editor, a part of Luttrell's\r\n     collection had found its way into the libraries of Mr.\r\n     Bindley and Mr. Heber, and thence was doomed to shine, with\r\n     renewed lustre, by the side of the poetry of Dryden.]\r\n\r\nIV. _Unique Copies._ A passion for a book which has any peculiarity\r\nabout it, by either, or both, of the foregoing methods of\r\nillustration--or which is remarkable for its size, beauty, and\r\ncondition--is indicative of a rage for _unique copies_, and is\r\nunquestionably a strong prevailing symptom of the Bibliomania. Let me\r\ntherefore urge every sober and cautious collector not to be fascinated\r\nby the terms \"_Matchless, and Unique_;\" which, \"in slim Italicks\" (to\r\ncopy Dr. Ferriar's happy expression) are studiously introduced into\r\nBookseller's catalogues to lead the unwary astray. Such a Collector\r\nmay fancy himself proof against the temptation; and will, in\r\nconsequence, _call only to look at_ this unique book, or set of books;\r\nbut, when he views the morocco binding, silk water-tabby lining,\r\nblazing gilt edges--when he turns over the white and spotless\r\nleaves--gazes on the amplitude of margin--on a rare and lovely print\r\nintroduced--and is charmed with the soft and coaxing manner in which,\r\nby the skill of Herring or Mackinlay,[59] \"leaf succeeds to leaf\"--he\r\ncan no longer bear up against the temptation--and, confessing himself\r\nvanquished, purchases, and retreats--exclaiming with Virgil's\r\nshepherd--\r\n\r\n     Ut vidi, ut perii--ut me malus abstulit error!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 59: At page 8, note--the reader has been led to\r\n     expect a few remarks upon the luxuriancy of modern\r\n     book-binding. Mr. Roscoe, in his Lorenzo de Medici, vol.\r\n     ii., p. 79., edit. 8vo., has defended the art with so much\r\n     skill that nothing further need be said in commendation of\r\n     it. Admitting every degree of merit to our present\r\n     fashionable binders, and frankly allowing them the\r\n     superiority over De Rome, Padaloup, and the old school of\r\n     binding, I cannot but wish to see revived those beautiful\r\n     portraits, arabesque borders, and sharp angular ornaments,\r\n     that are often found on the outsides of books bound in the\r\n     16th century, with calf leather, upon oaken boards. These\r\n     brilliant decorations almost make us forget the ivory\r\n     crucifix, guarded with silver doors, which is frequently\r\n     introduced in the interior of the sides of the binding. Few\r\n     things are more gratifying to a genuine collector than a\r\n     fine copy of a book in its _original binding_!]\r\n\r\nV. _Copies printed on vellum._ A desire for works printed in this\r\nmanner is an equally strong and general symptom of the Bibliomania;\r\nbut as these works are rarely to be obtained of modern[60] date, the\r\ncollector is obliged to have recourse to specimens, executed three\r\ncenturies ago, in the printing-offices of Aldus, Verard, and the\r\nJuntæ. Although the Bibliothéque Imperiale, at Paris, and the library\r\nof Count Macarty, at Toulouse, are said to contain the greatest number\r\nof books printed upon vellum, yet, those who have been fortunate\r\nenough to see copies of this kind in the libraries of his Majesty, the\r\nDuke of Marlborough, Earl Spencer, Mr. Johnes, and the late Mr.\r\nCracherode (now in the British Museum), need not travel on the\r\nContinent for the sake of being convinced of their exquisite beauty\r\nand splendour. Mr. Edward's _unique_ copy (he will forgive the\r\nepithet) of the first Livy, upon vellum, is a Library of itself!--and\r\nthe recent discovery of a vellum copy of Wynkyn De Worde's reprint of\r\n_Juliana Barnes's book_,[61] complete in every respect, [to say\r\nnothing of his Majesty's similar copy of Caxton's _Doctrinal of\r\nSapience_, 1489, in the finest preservation] are, to be sure,\r\nsufficient demonstrations of the prevalence of this symptom of the\r\nBibliomania in the times of our forefathers; so that it cannot be\r\nsaid, as some have asserted, to have appeared entirely within the last\r\nhalf century.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 60: The modern books, printed upon vellum, have in\r\n     general not succeeded; whether from the art of preparing the\r\n     vellum, or of printing upon it, being lost I will not\r\n     presume to determine.

Whoever is\r\npossessed with a passion for collecting books of this kind may\r\nunquestionably be said to exhibit a strong symptom of the Bibliomania;\r\nbut such a case is not quite hopeless, nor is it deserving of severe\r\ntreatment or censure. All bibliographers have dwelt on the importance\r\nof these editions, for the sake of collation with subsequent ones, and\r\ndetecting, as is frequently the case, the carelessness displayed by\r\nfuture[63] editors. Of such importance is the _first edition of\r\nShakspeare_[64] considered, that a fac-simile reprint of it has been\r\npublished with success. In regard to the Greek and Latin Classics, the\r\npossession of these original editions is of the first consequence to\r\neditors who are anxious to republish the legitimate text of an author.\r\nWakefield, I believe always regretted that the first edition of\r\nLucretius had not been earlier inspected by him. When he began _his_\r\nedition, the Editio Princeps was not (as I have understood) in the\r\nlibrary of Earl Spencer--the storehouse of almost every thing that is\r\nexquisite and rare in ancient classical literature!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 62: There is a curious and amusing article in\r\n     Bayle [English edition, vol. i., 672, &c.] about the elder\r\n     ANCILLON, who frankly confessed that he \"was troubled with\r\n     the BIBLIOMANIA, or disease of buying books.\" Mr. D'Israeli\r\n     says \"that he always purchased _first editions_, and never\r\n     waited for second ones,\"--but I find it, in the English\r\n     Bayle, note D, \"he chose _the best_ editions.\" The manner in\r\n     which Ancillon's library was pillaged by the Ecclesiastics\r\n     of Metz (where it was considered as the most valuable\r\n     curiosity in the town) is thus told by Bayle; \"Ancillon was\r\n     obliged to leave Metz: a company of Ecclesiastics, of all\r\n     orders, came from every part, to lay hands on this fine and\r\n     copious library, which had been collected with the utmost\r\n     care during forty years. They took away a great number of\r\n     the books together, and gave a little money, as they went\r\n     out, to a young girl, of twelve or thirteen years of age,\r\n     who looked after them, that they might have it to say they\r\n     had _paid for them_. Thus Ancillon saw that valuable\r\n     collection dispersed, in which, as he was wont to say, his\r\n     chief pleasure and even his heart was placed!\"--Edit. 1734.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 63: An instance of this kind may be adduced from\r\n     the _first edition_ of Fabian, printed in 1516; of which\r\n     Messrs. Longman, and Co., have now engaged a very able\r\n     editor to collate the text with that of the subsequent\r\n     editions. \"The antiquary,\" says the late Mr. BRAND, \"is\r\n     desired to consult the edition of Fabian, printed by Pynson,\r\n     in 1516, because there are others, and I remember to have\r\n     seen one in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, with a\r\n     continuation to the end of Queen Mary, 1559, in which the\r\n     _language is much modernised_.\" Shakespeare, edit. 1803,\r\n     vol. xviii. p. 85-6.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 64: A singular story is \"extant\" about the\r\n     purchase of the late Duke of Roxburgh's fine copy of the\r\n     first edition of Shakespeare. A friend was bidding for him\r\n     in the sale-room: his Grace had retired to a distance, to\r\n     view the issue of the contest. Twenty guineas and more were\r\n     offered, from various quarters, for the book: a slip of\r\n     paper was handed to the Duke, in which he was requested to\r\n     inform his friend whether he was \"to go on bidding\"--His\r\n     Grace took his pencil, and wrote underneath, by way of reply--\r\n\r\n          ----lay on Macduff!\r\n          And d----d be he who first cries, 'Hold, enough!'\r\n\r\n     Such a spirit was irresistible, and bore down all\r\n     opposition. His Grace retired triumphant, with the book\r\n     under his arm.]\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be forgotten that if first editions are, in some\r\ninstances, of great importance, they are in many respects superfluous,\r\nand an incumbrance to the shelves of a collector; inasmuch as the\r\nlabours of subsequent editors have corrected their errors, and\r\nsuperseded, by a great fund of additional matter, the necessity of\r\nconsulting them. Thus, not to mention other instances (which present\r\nthemselves while noticing the present one), all the fine things which\r\nColomiés and Remannus have said about the rarity of La Croix du\r\nMaine's Bibliotheque, published in 1584, are now unnecessary to be\r\nattended to, since the ample and excellent edition of this work by De\r\nLa Monnoye and Juvigny, in six quarto volumes, 1772, has appeared. Nor\r\nwill any one be tempted to hunt for Gesner's Bibliotheca of 1545-8,\r\nwhatever may be its rarity, who has attended to Morhof's and Vogt's\r\nrecommendation of the last and best edition of 1583.\r\n\r\nVII. _True Editions._ Some copies of a work are struck off with\r\ndeviations from the usually received ones, and, though these\r\ndeviations have neither sense nor beauty to recommend them, [and\r\nindeed are principally _defects_] yet copies of this description are\r\neagerly sought after by collectors of a certain class! This particular\r\npursuit may therefore be called another, or the seventh, symptom of\r\nthe Bibliomania. The note below [65] will furnish the reader with a\r\nfew anecdotes relating to it.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 65: _Cæsar. Lug.

Of all symptoms of the\r\nBibliomania, this eighth symptom (and the last which I shall notice)\r\nis at present the most powerful and prevailing. Whether it was not\r\nimported into this country from Holland, by the subtlety of\r\nSchelhorn[66] (a knowing writer upon rare and curious books) may be\r\nshrewdly suspected. Whatever be its origin, certain it is, my dear\r\nSir, that books printed in the black letter are now coveted with an\r\neagerness unknown to our collectors in the last century. If the\r\nspirits of West, Ratcliffe, Farmer and Brand, have as yet held any\r\nintercourse with each other, in that place 'from whose bourne no\r\ntraveller returns,' what must be the surprise of the three former, on\r\nbeing told by the latter, of the prices given for some of the books in\r\nhis library, as mentioned below!?[67]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 66: His words are as follow: \"Ipsa typorum\r\n     ruditas, ipsa illa atra crassaque literarum facies _belle\r\n     tangit sensus, &c._\" Was ever the black letter more\r\n     eloquently described?

Under a proper spirit of\r\nmodification it has done, and will continue to do, essential service\r\nto the cause of English literature. It guided the taste, and\r\nstrengthened the judgment, of Tyrwhitt in his researches after\r\nChaucerian lore. It stimulated the studies of Farmer and of Steevens,\r\nand enabled them to twine many a beauteous flower round the brow of\r\ntheir beloved Shakespeare. It has since operated, to the same effect,\r\nin the labours of Mr. Douce,[68] the _Porson_ of old English and\r\nFrench literature; and in the editions of Milton and Spenser, by my\r\namiable and excellent friend Mr. Todd the public have had a specimen\r\nof what the _Black Letter_ may perform, when temperately and skilfully\r\nexercised.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 68: In the criticisms on Mr. Douce's\r\n     _Illustrations of Shakspeare and Ancient Manners_, it has\r\n     not, I think, been generally noticed that this work is\r\n     distinguished; 1. For the singular diffidence and urbanity\r\n     of criticism, as well as depth of learning, which it\r\n     evinces: 2. For the happy illustrations, by means of wood\r\n     cuts: Let any one, for instance, read a laboured\r\n     disquisition on the punishment of \"the boots\"--and only\r\n     glance his eye on the plate representing it [vol. i. p.\r\n     34.]: from which will he obtain the clearer notions? 3. For\r\n     the taste, elegance, and general correctness with which it\r\n     is printed. The only omission I regret is that Mr. Douce did\r\n     not give us, at the end, a list of the works alphabetically\r\n     arranged, with their dates which he consulted in the\r\n     formation of his own. Such a BIBLIOTHECA SHAKSPEARIANA\r\n     might, however, have been only a fresh stimulus to the\r\n     increase of the black-letter symptom of the _Bibliomania_.\r\n     How Bartholomæus and Batman have risen in price since the\r\n     publication of Mr. Douce's work, let those who have lately\r\n     smarted for the increase tell!]\r\n\r\nI could bring to your recollection other instances; but your own\r\ncopious reading and exact memory will better furnish you with them.\r\nLet me not however omit remarking that the beautiful pages of the\r\n_Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, and Sir Trestrem_, exhibit, in the\r\nnotes [now and then thickly studded with black letter references], a\r\nproof that the author of \"The Lay\" and \"Marmion\" has not disdained to\r\nenrich his stores of information by such intelligence as black\r\nlettered books impart. In short, though this be also a strong and\r\ngeneral symptom of the Bibliomania, it is certainly not attended with\r\ninjurious effects when regulated by prudence and discretion. An\r\nundistinguishable voracious appetite, to swallow every thing printed\r\nin the black letter can only bring on inconquerable disease, if not\r\ndeath, to the patient!\r\n\r\nHaving in the two preceding divisions of this letter discoursed\r\nsomewhat largely upon the HISTORY and SYMPTOMS of the Bibliomania, it\r\nnow remains, according to the original plan, to say a few words upon\r\nthe PROBABLE MEANS OF ITS CURE. And, indeed, I am driven to this view\r\nof the subject from every laudable motive; for it would be highly\r\ncensurable to leave any reflecting mind impressed with melancholy\r\nemotions concerning the misery and mortality that have been occasioned\r\nby the abuse of those pursuits, to which the most soothing and\r\nimportant considerations ought to be attached. Far from me, and my\r\nfriends, be such a cruel, if not criminal, conduct; let us then, my\r\ndear Sir, seriously discourse upon the\r\n\r\nIII. PROBABLE MEANS OF THE CURE of the Bibliomania. _He_ will surely\r\nbe numbered among the philanthropists of his day who has, more\r\nsuccessfully than myself, traced and described the ravages of this\r\ndisease, and fortified the sufferer with the means of its cure. But,\r\nas this is a disorder of quite a recent date, and as its\r\ncharacteristics, in consequence, cannot be yet fully known or\r\ndescribed, great candour must be allowed to that physician who offers\r\na prescription for so obscure and complicated a case. It is in vain\r\nthat you search the works [ay, even the best editions] of Hippocrates\r\nand Galen for a description of this malady; nor will you find it\r\nhinted at in the more philosophical treatises of Sydenham and\r\nHeberden. It had, till the medical skill of Dr. Ferriar first noticed\r\nit to the public, escaped the observations of all our pathologists.\r\nWith a trembling hand, and fearful apprehension, therefore, I throw\r\nout the following suggestions for the cure, or mitigatiou\r\n[Transcriber's Note: mitigation], of this disorder:\r\n\r\nIn _the first place_, the disease of the Bibliomania is materially\r\nsoftened, or rendered mild, by directing our studies to _useful and\r\nprofitable_ works--whether these be printed upon small or large paper,\r\nin the gothic, roman, or italic type; To consider purely the\r\n_intrinsic_ excellence, and not the exterior splendour, or\r\nadventitious value, of any production, will keep us perhaps wholly\r\nfree from this disease. Let the midnight lamp be burnt to illuminate\r\nthe stores of antiquity--whether they be romances, or chronicles, or\r\nlegends, and whether they be printed by Aldus or by Caxton--if a\r\nbrighter lustre can thence be thrown upon the pages of modern\r\nlearning! To trace genius to its source, or to see how she has been\r\ninfluenced or modified, by \"the lore of past times\" is both a pleasing\r\nand profitable pursuit. To see how Shakspeare has here and there\r\nplucked a flower, from some old ballad or popular tale, to enrich his\r\nown unperishable garland--to follow Spenser and Milton in their\r\ndelightful labyrinths 'midst the splendour of Italian literature--are\r\nstudies which stamp a dignity upon our intellectual characters! But,\r\nin such a pursuit let us not overlook the wisdom of modern times, nor\r\nfancy that what is only ancient can be excellent. We must remember\r\nthat Bacon, Boyle, Locke, Taylor, Chillingworth, Robertson, Hume,\r\nGibbon, and Paley, are names which always command attention from the\r\nwise, and remind us of the improved state of reason and acquired\r\nknowledge during the two last centuries.\r\n\r\nIn the _second place_, the re-printing of scarce and intrinsically\r\nvaluable works is another means of preventing the propagation of this\r\ndisorder. Amidst all our present sufferings under the BIBLIOMANIA, it\r\nis some consolation to find discerning and spirited booksellers\r\nre-publishing the valuable Chronicles of Froissart, Holinshed, and\r\nHall,[69] and the collections known by the names of \"The Harleïan\r\nMiscellany,\" and \"Lord Somer's Tracts.\" These are noble efforts, and\r\nrichly deserve the public patronage.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 69: The re-publication of these chronicles is to\r\n     be followed by those of Grafton and Fabian. Meanwhile,\r\n     Hakluyt's Voyages, (projected by Mr. Evans), and Fuller's\r\n     Worthies (by Messrs. Longman, and Co.) will form admirable\r\n     acquisitions to these treasures of past times.]\r\n\r\nIn the _third place_, the editing of our best ancient authors, whether\r\nin prose or poetry,[70] is another means of effectually counteracting\r\nthe progress of the Bibliomania, as it has been described under its\r\nseveral symptoms.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 70: The recent _Variorum_ editions of Shakspeare,\r\n     of which some yet prefer that of Steevens, 1793, 15 vols.\r\n     8vo.--Mr. Todd's editions of Milton and Spenser; Mr. G.\r\n     Chalmers' edition of Sir David Lyndsay's works; Mr.\r\n     Gifford's edition of Massinger; and Mr. Octavius\r\n     Gilchrist's, of Bishop Corbett's poems, exemplify the good\r\n     effects of this _third means of cure_.]\r\n\r\nIn the _fourth place_, the erecting of Public Institutions[71] is a\r\nvery powerful antidote against the prevalence of several symptoms of\r\nthis disease.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 71: The Royal, London, Surrey, and Russel\r\n     Institutions have been the means of concentrating, in divers\r\n     parts of the metropolis, large libraries of _useful_ books;\r\n     which, it is to be hoped, will eventually suppress the\r\n     establishment of what are called _Circulating\r\n     Libraries_--vehicles, too often, of insufferable nonsense,\r\n     and irremediable mischief!]\r\n\r\nIn the _fifth place_, the encouragement of the study of\r\nBibliography,[72] in its legitimate sense, and towards its true\r\nobject, may be numbered among the most efficacious cures for this\r\ndestructive malady. To place competent Librarians over the several\r\ndepartments of a large public Library, or to submit a library, on a\r\nmore confined scale, to one diligent, enthusiastic, well informed,\r\nwell bred, Bibliographer[73] or Librarian, [of which in this\r\nmetropolis we have so many examples] is doing a vast deal towards\r\ndirecting the channels of literature to flow in their proper courses.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 72: \"UNNE BONNE BIBLIOGRAPHIE,\" says Marchand,\r\n     \"soit générale soit particulière, soit profane, soit\r\n     écclésiastique, soit nationale, provinciale, ou locale, soit\r\n     simplement personnelle, en un mot de quelque autre genre que\r\n     ce puisse être, n'est pas un ouvrage aussi facile que\r\n     beaucoup de gens se le pourroient imaginer; mais, elles ne\r\n     doivent néanmoins nulelment [Transcriber's Note: nullement]\r\n     prévenir contre celle-ci. Telle qu'elle est, elle ne laisse\r\n     pas d'être bonne, utile, et digne d'être recherchée par les\r\n     amateurs, de l'Histoire Littéraire.\" _Diction. Historique_,\r\n     vol. i. p. 109.\r\n\r\n     \"Our nation,\" says Mr. Bridgman, \"has been too inattentive\r\n     to bibliographical criticisms and enquiries; for generally\r\n     the English reader is obliged to resort to foreign writers\r\n     to satisfy his mind as to the value of authors. It behoves\r\n     us to consider that there is not a more useful or a more\r\n     desirable branch of education than a _knowledge of books_;\r\n     which being correctly ascertained and judiciously exercised,\r\n     will prove the touch-stone of intrinsic merit, and have the\r\n     effect of saving many spotless pages from prostitution.\"\r\n     _Legal Bibliography_, p. v. vi.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 73: Peignot, in his _Dictionnaire de Bibliologie_,\r\n     vol. i. 50, has given a very pompous account of what ought\r\n     to be the talents and duties of a Bibliographer. It would be\r\n     difficult indeed to find such things united in one person!\r\n     De Bure, in the eighth volume of his _Bibliographie\r\n     Instructive_, has prefixed a \"Discourse upon the Science of\r\n     Bibliography and the duties of a Bibliographer\" which is\r\n     worth consulting: but I know of nothing which better\r\n     describes, in few words, such a character, than the\r\n     following: \"In eo sit multijuga materiarum librorumque\r\n     notitia, ut saltem potiores eligat et inquirat: fida et\r\n     sedula apud exteras gentes procuratio, ut eos arcessat;\r\n     summa patientia ut rarè venalis expectet: peculium semper\r\n     præsens et paratum, ne, si quando occurrunt, emendi occasio\r\n     intercidat; prudens denique auri argentique contemptus, ut\r\n     pecuniis sponte careat quæ in bibliothecam formandam et\r\n     nutriendam sunt insumendæ. Si fortè vir literatus eo\r\n     felicitatis pervenit ut talem thesaurum coaceraverit, nec\r\n     solus illo invidios fruatur, sed usum cum eruditis qui\r\n     vigilias suas utilitati publicæ devoverunt, liberaliter\r\n     communicet; &c.\"--_Bibliotheca Hulsiana_, vol. i. Præfat. p.\r\n     3, 4.]\r\n\r\nThus briefly and guardedly have I thrown out a few suggestions, which\r\nmay enable us to avoid, or mitigate the severity of, the disease\r\ncalled THE BIBLIOMANIA. Happy indeed shall I deem myself, if, in the\r\ndescription of its symptoms, and in the recommendation of the means of\r\ncure, I may have snatched any one from a premature grave, or lightened\r\nthe load of years that are yet to cone [Transcriber's Note: come]!\r\n\r\nYou, my dear Sir, who, in your observations upon society, as well as\r\nin your knowledge of ancient times, must have met with numerous\r\ninstances of the miseries which \"flesh is heir to,\" may be disposed\r\nperhaps to confess that, of all species of afflictions, _the present\r\none_ under consideration has the least moral turpitude attached to it.\r\nTrue, it may be so: for, in the examples which have been adduced,\r\nthere will be found neither Suicides, nor Gamesters, nor Profligates.\r\nNo woman's heart has been broken from midnight debaucheries: no\r\nmarriage vow has been violated: no child has been compelled to pine in\r\npoverty or neglect: no patrimony has been wasted, and no ancestor's\r\nfame tarnished! If men have erred under the influence of this disease,\r\ntheir aberrations have been marked with an excess arising from\r\nintellectual fevour, and not from a desire of baser gratifications.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, in the wide survey which a philosopher may take of the\r\n\"Miseries of Human life\"[74] the prevalence of this disorder may\r\nappear to be less mischievous than that of others, and, if some of the\r\nmost amiable and learned of mortals seemed to have been both\r\nunwilling, as well as unable, to avoid its contagion, you will\r\nprobably feel the less alarmed if symptoms of it should appear within\r\nthe sequestered abode of Hodnet![75] Recollecting that even in remoter\r\nsituations its influence has been felt--and that neither the pure\r\natmosphere of Hafod nor of Sledmere[76] has completely subdued its\r\npower--you will be disposed to exclaim with violence, at the intrusion\r\nof Bibliomaniacs--\r\n\r\n     What walls can guard me, or what shades can hide?\r\n     They pierce my thickets, through my grot they glide!\r\n     By land, by water, they renew the charge,\r\n     They stop the chariot, and they board the barge.[77]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 74: In the ingenious and witty work so entitled, I\r\n     do not recollect whether the disappointment arising from a\r\n     _cropt_ or a _dirty_ copy has been classed among \"_The\r\n     Miseries of Human Life_.\"]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 75: _Hodnet Hall_, Shropshire.

The conflagration of part of his mansion and\r\n     library, two years ago, which excited such a general\r\n     sympathy, would have damped any ardour of collection but\r\n     that of Mr. Johnes--his Library has arisen, Phoenix-like,\r\n     from the flames!\r\n\r\n     _Sledmere_, in Yorkshire, the seat of SIR MARK MASTERMAN\r\n     SYKES, Bart., M.P.

The abruptness of his appearance, and the velocity of his step,\r\nsomewhat disconcerted me; but on his near approach my apprehensions\r\nwere dissipated.\r\n\r\nI knew him to be the servant of my old college friend, whom I chuse\r\nhere to denominate LYSANDER. He came to inform me, in his blunt and\r\nhonest manner, that his master had just arrived with PHILEMON, our\r\ncommon friend; and that, as they were too fatigued with their journey\r\nto come out to me, they begged I would quickly enter the house, and,\r\nas usual, make them welcome. This intelligence afforded me the\r\nliveliest satisfaction. In fifteen minutes, after a hearty shaking of\r\nhands, I was seated with them in the parlour; all of us admiring the\r\nunusual splendour of the evening sky, and, in consequence, partaking\r\nof the common topics of conversation with a greater flow of spirits.\r\n\r\n\"You are come, my friends,\" said I (in the course of conversation),\r\n\"to make some stay with me--indeed, I cannot suffer you to depart\r\nwithout keeping you at least a week; in order, amongst other things,\r\nto view the beauty of our neighbour Lorenzo's grounds, the general\r\nsplendour of his house, and the magnificence of his LIBRARY.\" \"In\r\nregard to grounds and furniture,\" replied Lysander, \"there is very\r\nlittle in the most beautiful and costly which can long excite my\r\nattention--but the LIBRARY--\" \"Here,\" exclaimed Philemon, \"here you\r\nhave him in the toils.\" \"I will frankly confess,\" rejoined Lysander,\r\n\"that I am an arrant BIBLIOMANIAC--that I love books dearly--that the\r\nvery sight, touch, and, more, the perusal--\" \"Hold, my friend,\" again\r\nexclaimed Philemon, \"you have renounced your profession--you talk of\r\n_reading_ books--do BIBLIOMANIACS ever _read_ books?\" \"Nay,\" quoth\r\nLysander, \"you shall not banter thus with impunity. We will, if it\r\nplease you,\" said he, turning round to me, \"make our abode with you\r\nfor a few days--and, after seeing the library of your neighbour, I\r\nwill throw down the gauntlet to Philemon, challenging him to answer\r\ncertain questions which you may put to us, respecting the number,\r\nrarity, beauty, or utility of those works which relate to the\r\nliterature and antiquities of our own country. We shall then see who\r\nis able to return the readiest answer.\" \"Forgive,\" rejoined Philemon,\r\n\"my bantering strain. I revoke my speech. You know that, with\r\nyourself, I heartily love books; more from their contents than their\r\nappearance.\" Lysander returned a gracious smile; and the hectic of\r\nirritability on his cheek was dissipated in an instant.\r\n\r\nThe approach of evening made us think of settling our plans. My\r\nfriends begged their horses might be turned into the field; and that,\r\nwhile they stayed with me, the most simple fare and the plainest\r\naccommodation might be their lot. They knew how little able I was to\r\ntreat them as they were wont to be treated; and, therefore, taking\r\n\"the will for the deed,\" they resolved to be as happy as an humble\r\nroof could make them.\r\n\r\nWhile the cloth was laying for supper (for I should add that we dine\r\nat three and sup at nine), we took a stroll in my small garden, which\r\nhas a mound at the bottom, shaded with lilacs and laburnums, that\r\noverlooks a pretty range of meadows, terminated by the village church.\r\nThe moon had now gained a considerable ascendancy in the sky; and the\r\nsilvery paleness and profound quiet of the surrounding landscape,\r\nwhich, but an hour ago, had been enlivened by the sun's last rays,\r\nseemed to affect the minds of us all very sensibly. Lysander, in\r\nparticular, began to express the sentiments which such a scene excited\r\nin him.--\"Yonder,\" says he, pointing to the church-yard, \"is the\r\nbourne which terminates our earthly labours; and I marvel much how\r\nmortals can spend their time in cavilling at each other--in murdering,\r\nwith their pens as well as their swords, all that is excellent and\r\nadmirable in human nature--instead of curbing their passions,\r\nelevating their hopes, and tranquillizing their fears. Every evening,\r\nfor at least one-third of the year, heaven has fixed in the sky yonder\r\nvisible monitor to man. Calmness and splendour are her attendants: no\r\ndark passions, no carking cares, neither spleen nor jealousy, seem to\r\ndwell in that bright orb, where, as has been fondly imagined, \"the\r\nwretched may have rest.\"--\"And here,\" replied Philemon, \"we do nothing\r\nbut fret and fume if our fancied merits are not instantly rewarded, or\r\nif another wear a sprig of laurel more verdant than ourselves; I could\r\nmention, within my own recollection, a hundred instances of this\r\ndegrading prostitution of talent--aye, a thousand.\"--\"Gently reprimand\r\nyour fellow creatures,\" resumed Lysander, \"lest you commit an error as\r\ngreat as any of those which you condemn in others. The most difficult\r\nof human tasks seems to be the exercise of forbearance and temperance.\r\nBy exasperating, you only rekindle, and not extinguish, the evil\r\nsparks in our dispositions. A man will bear being told he is in the\r\nwrong; but you must tell him so gently and mildly. Animosity,\r\npetulance, and persecution, are the plagues which destroy our better\r\nparts.\"--\"And envy,\" replied Philemon, \"has surely enough to\r\ndo.\"--\"Yes,\" said Lysander, \"we might enumerate, as you were about to\r\ndo, many instances--and (what you were not about to do) pity while we\r\nenumerate! I think,\" continued he, addressing himself particularly to\r\nme, \"you informed me that the husband of poor Lavinia lies buried in\r\nyonder church-yard; and perhaps the very tomb which now glistens by\r\nthe moonbeam is the one which consecrates his memory! That man was\r\npassionately addicted to literature;--he had a strong mind; a\r\nwonderful grasp of intellect; but his love of paradox and hypothesis\r\nquite ruined his faculties. NICAS happened to discover some glaring\r\nerrors in his last treatise, and the poor man grew sick at heart in\r\nconsequence. Nothing short of _infallibility_ and _invincibility_\r\nsatisfied him; and, like the Spaniard in the 'Diable Boiteux,' who\r\nwent mad because five of his countrymen had been beaten by fifty\r\nPortugese, this unhappy creature lost all patience and forbearance,\r\nbecause, in an hundred systems which he had built with the cards of\r\nfancy, ninety-nine happened to tumble to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"This is the dangerous consequence, not so much of vanity and\r\nself-love as of downright literary Quixotism. A man may be cured of\r\nvanity as the French nobleman was--'Ecoutez messieurs! Monseigneur le\r\nDuc va dire la meillure chose du monde!'[78] but for this raving,\r\nungovernable passion of soaring beyond all human comprehension, I fear\r\nthere is no cure but in such a place as the one which is now before\r\nus. Compared with this, how different was MENANDER'S case! Careless\r\nhimself about examining and quoting authorities with punctilious\r\naccuracy, and trusting too frequently to the _ipse-dixits_ of good\r\nfriends:--with a quick discernment--a sparkling fancy--great store of\r\nclassical knowledge, and a never ceasing play of colloquial wit, he\r\nmoved right onwards in his manly course--the delight of the gay, and\r\nthe admiration of the learned! He wrote much and variously: but in an\r\nevil hour the demon Malice caught him abroad--watched his\r\ndeviations--noted down his failings--and, discovering his vulnerable\r\npart, he did not fail, like another Paris, to profit by the discovery.\r\nMenander became the victim of over-refined sensibility: he need not\r\nhave feared the demon, as no good man need fear Satan. His pen ceased\r\nto convey his sentiments; he sickened at heart; and after his body had\r\nbeen covered by the green grass turf, the gentle elves of fairy-land\r\ntook care to weave a chaplet to hang upon his tomb, which was never to\r\nknow decay! SYCORAX was this demon; and a cunning and clever demon was\r\nhe!\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 78: This is the substance of the story related in\r\n     Darwin's _Zoonomia_: vol. iv. p. 81.]\r\n\r\n\"I am at a loss,\" said Philemon, \"to comprehend exactly what you\r\nmean?\"--\"I will cease speaking metaphorically,\" replied Lysander; \"but\r\nSycorax was a man of ability in his way. He taught literary men, in\r\nsome measure, the value of careful research and faithful quotation; in\r\nother words, he taught them to speak the truth as they found her; and,\r\ndoubtless, for this he merits not the name of a demon, unless you\r\nallow me the priviledge of a Grecian.[79] That Sycorax loved truth\r\nmust be admitted; but that he loved no one so much as himself to speak\r\nthe truth must also be admitted. Nor had he, after all, any grand\r\nnotions of the goddess. She was, in his sight, rather of diminutive\r\nthan gigantic growth; rather of a tame than a towering mien; dressed\r\nout in little trinkets, and formally arrayed in the faded point-lace\r\nand elevated toupee of the ancient English school, and not in the\r\nflowing and graceful robes of Grecian simplicity. But his malice and\r\nill-nature were frightful; and withal his love of scurrility and abuse\r\nquite intolerable. He mistook, in too many instances, the manner for\r\nthe matter; the shadow for the substance. He passed his criticisms,\r\nand dealt out his invectives, with so little ceremony, and so much\r\nvenom, that he seemed born with a scalping knife in his hand to commit\r\nmurder as long as he lived! To him, censure was sweeter than praise;\r\nand the more elevated the rank, and respectable the character of his\r\nantagonist, the more dexterously he aimed his blows, and the more\r\nfrequently he renewed his attacks. In consequence, scarcely one\r\nbeautiful period, one passionate sentiment of the higher order, one\r\nelevated thought, or philosophical deduction, marked his numerous\r\nwritings. 'No garden-flower grew wild' in the narrow field of his\r\nimagination; and, although the words decency and chastity were\r\ncontinually dropping from his lips, I suspect that the reverse of\r\nthese qualities was always settled round his heart.[80] Thus you see,\r\nmy dear Philemon,\" concluded Lysander, \"that the love of paradox, of\r\ncarelessness, and of malice, are equally destructive of that true\r\nsubstantial fame which, as connected with literature, a wise and an\r\nhonest man would wish to establish. But come; the dews of evening\r\nbegin to fall chilly; let us seek the house of our friend.\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 79: Without turning over the ponderous tones of\r\n     Stephen, Constantine, and Scaliger, consult the sensible\r\n     remarks upon the word '[Greek: Daimôn]' in _Parkhurst's\r\n     Greek and English Lexicon to the New Testament_, 8vo. edit.\r\n     1798.

We want here, it is true, the 'sweet shady\r\narbour--the contexture of woodbines, sweet-briar, jessamine, and\r\nmyrtle,'[81] and the time of the evening prevents our enjoying it\r\nwithout; but, in lieu of all this, we have the sight of books, of\r\nbusts, and of pictures. I see there the ponderous folio chronicles,\r\nthe genuine quarto romances, and, a little above, a glittering row of\r\nthin, closely-squeezed, curiously-gilt, volumes of original plays. As\r\nwe have finished our supper, let us--\" \"My friends,\" observed I, \"not\r\na finger upon a book to-night--to-morrow you may ransack at your\r\npleasure. I wish to pursue the conversation commenced by Lysander, as\r\nwe were strolling in the garden.\" \"Agreed,\" replied Philemon,--\"the\r\nquietness of the hour--the prospect, however limited, before us--(for\r\nI shall not fail to fix my eyes upon a Froissart printed by Verard, or\r\na portrait painted by Holbein, while you talk)--every thing conspires\r\nto render this discourse congenial.\" \"As you have reminded me of that\r\npretty description of a repast in Walton,\" resumed Lysander, \"I will\r\npreface the sequel to my conversation by drinking a glass to your\r\nhealths--and so, masters, 'here is a full glass to you' of the liquor\r\nbefore us.\" Lysander then continued, \"It were to be wished that the\r\nrepublic or region of LITERATURE could be described in as favourable a\r\nmanner as Camden has described the air, earth, and sky, of our own\r\ncountry;[82] but I fear Milton's terrific description of the infernal\r\nfrozen continent,\r\n\r\n             beat with perpetual forms\r\n     Of whirlwind and dire hail,\r\n\r\n     _Par. Lost_, b. ii. v. 587.\r\n\r\nis rather applicable to it. Having endeavoured to shew, my dear\r\nfriends, that the passionate love of hypothesis--(or a determination\r\nto make every man think and believe as we do) incorrigible\r\ncarelessness--and equally incorrigible ill-nature--are each inimical\r\nto the true interests of literature, let us see what other evil\r\nqualities there are which principally frustrate the legitimate view of\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 81: _Complete Angler_, p. 335.

If ancient GILDAS\r\n     speak the truth, Great Britain was no contemptible place\r\n     twelve hundred years ago--the period when he lived and wrote\r\n     his lachrymable history.\r\n\r\n     \"The iland of Britaine placed in the ballance of the divine\r\n     poising hand (as they call it) which weigheth the whole\r\n     world, almost the uttermost bound of his earth towards the\r\n     South and West; extending itself from the South-West, out\r\n     towards the North pole, eight hundred miles in length; and\r\n     containing two hundred in breadth, besides the fare\r\n     outstretched forelands of sundry promonteries, embraced by\r\n     the embowed bosomes of the ocean sea; with whose most\r\n     spacious, and on every side (saving only the Southern\r\n     Streights, by which we sale to Gallehelgicke) impassable\r\n     enclosure (as I may call it) she is strongly defended;\r\n     enriched with the mouths of two noble floods, Thames and\r\n     Severne, as it were two armes (by which out-landish\r\n     commodities have in times past been transported into the\r\n     same) besides other rivers of lesser account, strengthened\r\n     with eight and twenty cities, and some other castles, not\r\n     meanly fenced with fortresses of walls, embattled towers,\r\n     gates, and buildings (whose roofes being raised aloft with a\r\n     threatening hugenesse, were mightily in their aspiring\r\n     toppes compaced) adorned with her large spreading fields,\r\n     pleasant seated hils, even framed for good husbandry, which\r\n     over-mastereth the ground, and mountains most convenient for\r\n     the changeable pastures of cattell; whose flowers of sundry\r\n     collours, troden by the feete of men, imprint no unseemly\r\n     picture on the same, as a spouse of choice, decked with\r\n     divers jewels; watered with cleere fountains, and sundry\r\n     brokes, beating on the snow-white sands, together with\r\n     silver streames sliding forth with soft sounding noise, and\r\n     leaving a pledge of sweet savours on their bordering bankes,\r\n     and lakes gushing out abundantly in cold running\r\n     rivers.\"--_Epistle of Gildas_, Transl. 1638, 12mo. p. 1,\r\n     after the prologue.\r\n\r\n     Whoever looks into that amusing and prettily-printed little\r\n     book, \"_Barclaii Satyricon_,\" 1629, 18mo., will find a\r\n     description of Germany, similar, in part, to the\r\n     preceding.--\"Olim sylvis et incolis fera, nunc oppidis\r\n     passim insignis; nemoribus quoque quibus immensis tegebatur,\r\n     ad usum decusque castigatis.\" p. 316.]\r\n\r\n\"In the example of GONZALO, with whom Philemon is perfectly well\r\nacquainted, a remarkable exemplification of the passion of _Vanity_\r\noccurs. I recollect, one evening, he came rushing into a party where I\r\nsat, screaming with the extatic joy of a maniac--'[Greek: Eurêka,\r\nEurêka]'; and, throwing down a scroll, rushed as precipitately out of\r\nthe room. The scroll was of vellum; the title to the contents of it\r\nwas penned in golden letters, and softly-painted bunches of roses\r\ngraced each corner. It contained a sonnet to love, and another to\r\nfriendship; but a principal mistake which struck us, on the very\r\nthreshold of our critical examination, was that he had incorrectly\r\nentitled these sonnets. Friendship should have been called love, and\r\nlove, friendship. We had no sooner made the discovery than Gonzalo\r\nreturned, expecting to find us in like ecstacies with himself!--We\r\ngravely told him that we stumbled at the very threshold. It was quite\r\nsufficient--he seized his sonnets with avidity--and, crumpling the\r\nroll (after essaying to tear it) thrust it into his pocket, and\r\nretreated. One of the gentlemen in company made the following remarks,\r\non his leaving us: 'In the conduct of Gonzalo appears a strange\r\nmixture of intellectual strength and intellectual debility; of wit and\r\ndulness; of wisdom and folly; and all this arises chiefly from his\r\nmistaking the means for the end--the instrument of achieving for the\r\nobject achieved. The fondest wish of his heart is literary fame: for\r\nthis he would sacrifice every thing. He is handsome, generous, an\r\naffectionate son, a merry companion, and is, withal, a very excellent\r\nbelles-lettres scholar. Tell him that the ladies admire him, that his\r\nmother doats on him, and that his friends esteem him--and--keeping\r\nback the wished-for eulogy of literary excellence--you tell him of\r\nnothing which he cares for. In truth he might attain some portion of\r\nintellectual reputation, if he would throw aside his ridiculous\r\nhabits. He _must_, as soon as the evening shades prevail, burn wax\r\ntapers--he must always have an Argand lamp lighted up before him, to\r\nthrow a picturesque effect upon a dark wood painted by Hobbima--his\r\npens must be made from the crow's wing--his wax must be green--his\r\npaper must be thick and hot-pressed; and he must have a portfolio of\r\nthe choicest bits of ancient vellum that can be procured--his body\r\nmust recline upon a chintz sofa--his foot must be perched upon an\r\nottoman--in short he _must_ have every thing for which no man of\r\ncommon sense would express the least concern. Can you be surprised,\r\ntherefore, that he should commence his sonnet to friendship thus:\r\n\r\n     Oh, sweetest softest thing that's friendship hight!\r\n\r\nor that he should conceive the following address to women, by one\r\nWilliam Goddard, worthy of being ranked among the most beautiful\r\npoetical efforts of the 16th century:\r\n\r\n     Stars of this earthly heaven, you whose essence\r\n     Compos'd was of man's purest quintessence,\r\n     To you, to virtuous you, I dedicate\r\n     This snaggy sprig[83]----\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 83: From \"_A Satyrical Dialogue, &c., betweene\r\n     Alexander the Great and that truelye woman-hater Diogynes_.\r\n     Imprinted in the low countryes for all such gentlewomen as\r\n     are not altogether idle nor yet well occupyed,\" 4to. no\r\n     date. A strange composition! full of nervous lines and\r\n     pungent satire--but not free from the grossest\r\n     licentiousness.]\r\n\r\n\"Enough,\" exclaimed Philemon--while Lysander paused a little, after\r\nuttering the foregoing in a rapid and glowing manner--\"enough for this\r\neffeminate vanity in man! What other ills have you to enumerate, which\r\nassail the region of literature?\"--\"I will tell you,\" replied\r\nLysander, \"another, and a most lamentable evil, which perverts the\r\nvery end for which talents were given us--and it is in mistaking and\r\nmisapplying these talents. I speak with reference to the individual\r\nhimself, and not to the public. You may remember how grievously\r\nALFONSO bore the lot which public criticism, with one voice, adjudged\r\nto him! This man had good natural parts, and would have abridged a\r\nhistory, made an index, or analyzed a philosophical work, with great\r\ncredit to himself and advantage to the public. But he set his heart\r\nupon eclipsing Doctors Johnson and Jamieson. He happened to know a few\r\netymons more correctly, and to have some little acquaintance with\r\nblack letter literature, and hence thought to give more weight to\r\nlexicographical inquiries than had hitherto distinguished them. But\r\nhow miserably he was deceived in all his undertakings of this kind\r\npast events have sufficiently shewn. No, my good Philemon, to be of\r\nuse to the republic of literature, let us know our situations; and let\r\nus not fail to remember that, in the best appointed army, the serjeant\r\nmay be of equal utility with the captain.\r\n\r\n\"I will notice only one other, and a very great, failing observable in\r\nliterary men--and this is severity and self-consequence. You will find\r\nthat these severe characters generally set up the trade of _Critics_;\r\nwithout attending to the just maxim of Pope, that\r\n\r\n     Ten censure wrong, for one that writes amiss.\r\n\r\n\"With them, the least deviation from precise correctness, the most\r\nvenial trippings, the smallest inattention paid to doubtful rules and\r\nequivocal positions of criticism, inflames their anger, and calls\r\nforth their invectives. Regardless of the sage maxims of Cicero,\r\nQuintilian, and Horace, they not only disdain the sober rules which\r\ntheir ancient brethren have wisely laid down, and hold in contempt\r\nthe voice of the public,[84] but, forgetting the subject which they\r\nhave undertaken to criticise, they push the author out of his seat,\r\nquietly sit in it themselves, and fancy they entertain you by the\r\ngravity of their deportment, and their rash usurpation of the royal\r\nmonosyllable 'Nos.'[85] This solemn pronoun, or rather 'plural\r\nstyle,'[86] my dear Philemon, is oftentimes usurped by a half-starved\r\nlittle _I_, who sits immured in the dusty recess of a garret, and who\r\nhas never known the society nor the language of a gentleman; or it is\r\nassumed by a young graduate, just settled in his chambers, and flushed\r\nwith the triumph of his degree of 'B.A.', whose 'fond conceyte' [to\r\nborrow Master Francis Thynne's[87] terse style,] is, to wrangle for an\r\nasses shadowe, or to seke a knott in a rushe!'\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 84: \"Interdum vulgus rectum videt:\" says\r\n     Horace.--_Epist. lib._ ii. _ad. Augustum_, v. 63.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 85: Vide RYMERI _Foedera_--passim.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 86: A very recent, and very respectable, authority\r\n     has furnished me with this expression.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 87: See Mr. Todd's _Illustrations of Gower and\r\n     Chaucer_, p. 10.]\r\n\r\n\"For my part,\" continued Lysander, speaking with the most unaffected\r\nseriousness--\"for my part, nothing delights me more than modesty and\r\ndiffidence, united with 'strong good sense, lively imagination, and\r\nexquisite sensibility,'[88] whether in an author or a critic. When I\r\ncall to mind that our greatest sages have concluded their labours\r\nwith doubt, and an avowal of their ignorance; when I see how carefully\r\nand reverently they have pushed forward their most successful\r\ninquiries; when I see the great Newton pausing and perplexed in the\r\nvast world of planets, comets, and constellations, which were, in a\r\nmeasure, of his own creation--I learn to soften the asperity of my\r\ncritical anathemas, and to allow to an author that portion of\r\nfallibility of which I am conscious myself.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 88: It is said, very sensibly, by La Bruyere, I\r\n     will allow that good writers are scarce enough; but then I\r\n     ask where are the people that know how to read and judge? A\r\n     union of these qualities, which are seldom found in the same\r\n     person, seems to be indispensably necessary to form an able\r\n     critic; he ought to possess strong good sense, lively\r\n     imagination, and exquisite sensibility. And of these three\r\n     qualities, the last is the most important; since, after all\r\n     that can be said on the utility or necessity of rules and\r\n     precepts, it must be confessed that the merit of all works\r\n     of genius must be determined by taste and sentiment. \"Why do\r\n     you so much admire the Helen of Zeuxis?\" said one to\r\n     Nicostratus. \"You would not wonder why I so much admired it\r\n     (replied the painter) if you had my eyes.\"--WARTON: Note to\r\n     Pope's Essay on Criticism. _Pope's Works_, vol. i. 196,\r\n     edit. 1806.]\r\n\r\n\"I see then,\" rejoined Philemon, \"that you are an enemy to\r\n_Reviews_.\"[89] \"Far from it,\" replied Lysander, \"I think them of\r\nessential service to literature. They hold a lash over ignorance and\r\nvanity; and, at any rate, they take care to bestow a hearty\r\ncastigation upon vicious and sensual publications. Thus far they do\r\ngood: but, in many respects, they do ill--by substituting their own\r\nopinions for those of an author; by judging exclusively according to\r\ntheir own previously formed decisions in matters of religion and\r\npolitics; and by shutting out from your view the plan, and real\r\ntendency, of the book which they have undertaken to review, and\r\ntherefore ought to analyze. It is, to be sure, amusing to read the\r\nclamours which have been raised against some of the most valuable, and\r\nnow generally received, works! When an author recollects the pert\r\nconclusion of Dr. Kenrick's review of Dr. Johnson's Tour to the\r\nHebrides,[90] he need not fear the flippancy of a reviewer's wit, as\r\ndecisive of the fate of his publication!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 89: The earliest publications, I believe, in this\r\n     country, in the character of REVIEWS were there\r\n     [Transcriber's Note: the] _Weekly Memorials for the\r\n     Ingenious_, &c. Lond. 1683, 4to.--and _The Universal\r\n     Historical Bibliotheque_: or an Account of most of the\r\n     considerable Books printed in all Languages, in the Month of\r\n     January 1686. London, 1687, 4to. Five years afterwards came\r\n     forth _The Young Student's Library_, by the Athenian\r\n     Society, 1692, folio, \"a kind of common theatre where every\r\n     person may act, or take such part as pleases him best, and\r\n     what he does not like he may pass over, assuring himself\r\n     that, every one's judgment not being like his, another may\r\n     chuse what he mislikes, and so every one may be pleased in\r\n     their turns.\" Pref. A six weeks' frost is said to have\r\n     materially delayed the publication. After these, in the\r\n     subsequent century, appeared the _Old and New Memoirs of\r\n     Literature_; then, the _Works of the Learned_; upon which\r\n     was built, eclipsing every one that had preceeded it, and\r\n     not excelled by any subsequent similar critical journal,\r\n     _The Monthly Review_.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 90: After all, said the reviewing Doctor, we are\r\n     of opinion, with the author himself, that this publication\r\n     contains 'the sentiments of one who has seen but little:'\r\n     meaning, thereby, that the book was hardly worth perusal!\r\n     What has become of the said Dr. Kenrick now? We will not ask\r\n     the same question about the said DR. JOHNSON; whose works\r\n     are upon the shelf of every reading man of sense and\r\n     virtue.]\r\n\r\n\"It is certainly,\" pursued Lysander, \"a very prolific age of\r\nknowledge. There never was, at any one period of the world, so much\r\ngeneral understanding abroad. The common receptacles of the lower\r\norders of people present, in some degree, intellectual scenes. I mean,\r\nthat collision of logic, and corruscation of wit, which arise from the\r\nperusal of a newspaper; a production, by-the-bye, upon which Cowper\r\nhas conferred immortality.[91] You may remember, when we were driven\r\nby a sharp tempest of hail into the small public-house which stands at\r\nthe corner of the heath--what a _logomachy_--what a _war of words_ did\r\nwe hear! and all about sending troops to the north or south of Spain,\r\nand the justice or injustice of the newly-raised prices of admission\r\nto Covent Garden theatre!![92] The stage-coach, if you recollect,\r\npassed by quickly after our having drunk a tumbler of warm brandy and\r\nwater to preserve ourselves from catching cold; and into it glad\r\nenough we were to tumble! We had no sooner begun to be tolerably\r\ncomfortable and composed than a grave old gentleman commenced a most\r\nfurious Philippic against the prevailing studies, politics, and\r\nreligion of the day--and, in truth, this man evinced a wonderfully\r\nretentive memory, and a fair share of powers of argument; bringing\r\neverything, however, to the standard of his _own times_. It was in\r\nvain we strove to edge in the great _Whig and Tory Reviews_ of the\r\nnorthern and southern hemispheres! The obdurate champion of other\r\ntimes would not listen a moment, or stir one inch, in favour of these\r\nlatter publications. When he quitted us, we found that he was a ----\r\nof considerable consequence in the neighbourhood, and had acquired his\r\nfortune from the superior sagacity and integrity he had displayed in\r\nconsequence of having been educated at the free-school in the village\r\nof ----, one of the few public schools in this kingdom which has not\r\nfrustrated the legitimate views of its pious founder, by converting\r\nthat into a foppish and expensive establishment which was at once\r\ndesigned as an asylum for the poor and an academy to teach wisdom and\r\ngood morals.\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 91: See the opening the fourth book of \"_The\r\n     Task_;\" a picture perfectly original and unrivalled in its\r\n     manner.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 92: It is not less true, than surprising, that the\r\n     ridiculous squabbles, which disgraced both this theatre and\r\n     the metropolis, have been deemed deserving of a regular\r\n     series of publications in the shape of numbers--1, 2, 3, &c.\r\n     As if the subject had not been sufficiently well handled in\r\n     the lively sallies and brilliant touches of satire which had\r\n     before appeared upon it in the _Monthly Mirror_!]\r\n\r\nPhilemon was about to reply, with his usual warmth and quickness, to\r\nthe latter part of these remarks--as bearing too severely upon the\r\neminent public seminaries within seventy miles of the metropolis--but\r\nLysander, guessing his intentions from his manner and attitude, cut\r\nthe dialogue short by observing that we did not meet to discuss\r\nsubjects of a personal and irritable nature, and which had already\r\nexercised the wits of two redoubted champions of the church--but that\r\nour object, and the object of all rational and manly discussion, was\r\nto state opinions with frankness, without intending to wound the\r\nfeelings, or call forth the animadversions, of well-meaning and\r\nrespectable characters. \"I know,\" continued he, \"that you, Philemon,\r\nhave been bred in one of these establishments, under a man as\r\nvenerable for his years as he is eminent for his talents and worth;\r\nwho employs the leisure of dignified retirement in giving to the world\r\nthe result of his careful and profound researches; who, drinking\r\nlargely at the fountain head of classical learning, and hence feeling\r\nthe renovated vigour of youth (without having recourse to the black\r\nart of a Cornelius Agrippa[93]), circumnavigates 'the Erythrean\r\nsea'--then, ascending the vessel of Nearchus, he coasts 'from Indus to\r\nthe Euphrates'--and explores with an ardent eye what is curious and\r\nwhat is precious, and treasures in his sagacious mind what is most\r\nlikely to gratify and improve his fellow-countrymen. A rare and\r\neminent instance this of the judicious application of acquired\r\nknowledge!--and how much more likely is it to produce good, and to\r\nsecure solid fame, than to fritter away one's strength, and undermine\r\none's health, in perpetual pugilistic contests with snarling critics,\r\ndull commentators, and foul-mouthed philologists.\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 93: Let him who wishes to be regaled in a dull\r\n     dreary night--when the snow is heavily falling, and the wind\r\n     whistles hollowly--open those leaves of Bayle's _Historical\r\n     and Biographical Dictionary_ which relate to this\r\n     extraordinary character; and see there how adroitly Agrippa\r\n     is defended against the accusation of \"having two devils\r\n     attending him in the shape of two little dogs--one of them\r\n     being called Monsieur, and the other Mademoiselle\"--\"whereas\r\n     Paulus Jovius, Thevet, &c., speak only of _one_ dog, and\r\n     never mention his name.\" Vol. i. 357, 361; edit. 1736, 10\r\n     vols. folio.\r\n\r\n     The bibliographer, who wishes to be master of the most\r\n     curious and rare editions of his works, may go from Bayle to\r\n     Clement, and from Clement to Vogt. He must beware of the\r\n     castrated Lyons' editions \"per Beringos fratres\"--against\r\n     one of which Bayle declaims, and produces a specimen (quite\r\n     to his own liking) of the passage suppressed:--another, of a\r\n     similar kind, is adduced by Vogt (edit. 1793, pp. 19, 20);\r\n     who tells us, however, that an edition of 1544, 8vo.,\r\n     without mention of place or printer--and especially a\r\n     Cologne edition of 1598, by Hierat, in 12mo.--exhibits the\r\n     like castrations; p. 20. This has escaped Clement, learned\r\n     as he is upon the Lyons' editions, vol. i. 94, 95, 96. Bauer\r\n     (_Bibl. Libr. Rarior._) is here hardly worth consulting; and\r\n     the compilers of the celebrated _Nouveau Dict. Historique_\r\n     (Caen edit. 1789, vol. i. p. 7. Art. Agrippa) deserve\r\n     censure for the recommendation of these Lyons' editions\r\n     only.\r\n\r\n     Agrippa's \"VANITY OF SCIENCES\" was first published at\r\n     Antwerp in 4to. 1530; a book, upon the rarity of which\r\n     bibliographers delight to expatiate. His \"OCCULT\r\n     PHILOSOPHY\"--according to Bayle, in 1531 (at least, the\r\n     Elector of Cologne had seen several printed leaves of it in\r\n     this year), but according to Vogt and Bauer, in 1533.--There\r\n     is no question about the edition of 1533; of which Vogt\r\n     tells us, \"An Englishman, residing at Frankfort, anxiously\r\n     sought for a copy of it, offering fifty crowns (imperiales)\r\n     and more, without success.\" All the editions in Agrippa's\r\n     life-time (before 1536) are considered uncastrated, and the\r\n     best. It should not be forgotten that Brucker, in his _Hist.\r\n     Crit. Phil._, has given a masterly account of Agrippa, and\r\n     an analysis of his works.]\r\n\r\nPhilemon heartily assented to the truth of these remarks; and, more\r\nthan once, interrupted Lysander in his panegyrical peroration by his\r\ncheerings:[94] for he had, in his youth (as was before observed), been\r\ninstructed by the distinguished character upon whom the eulogy had\r\nbeen pronounced.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 94: This word is almost peculiar to our own\r\n     country, and means a vehement degree of applause. It is\r\n     generally used previous to, and during, a contest of any\r\n     kind--whether by men in red coats, or blue coats, or black\r\n     coats--upon land, upon water, or within doors. Even the\r\n     walls of St. Stephen's chapel frequently echo to the \"_loud\r\n     cheerings_\" of some kind or other. See every newspaper on\r\n     every important debate.]\r\n\r\nThe effort occasioned by the warmth in discussing such interesting\r\nsubjects nearly exhausted Lysander--when it was judged prudent to\r\nretire to rest. Each had his chamber assigned to him; and while the\r\nchequered moon-beam played upon the curtains and the wall, through the\r\nhalf-opened shutter, the minds of Lysander and Philemon felt a\r\ncorrespondent tranquillity; and sweet were their slumbers till the\r\nmorning shone full upon them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n=The Cabinet.=\r\n\r\nOUTLINE OF FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC BIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n     Condemn the daies of elders great or small,\r\n     And then blurre out the course of present tyme:\r\n     Cast one age down, and so doe orethrow all,\r\n     And burne the bookes of printed prose or ryme:\r\n     Who shall beleeve he rules, or she doth reign,\r\n     In tyme to come, if writers loose their paine\r\n     The pen records tyme past and present both:\r\n     Skill brings foorth bookes, and bookes is nurse to troth.\r\n\r\n     CHURCHYARD'S _Worthiness of Wales_\r\n       p. 18, edit. 1776.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n=The Cabinet.=\r\n\r\nOUTLINE OF FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC BIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n     Tout autour oiseaulx voletoient\r\n     Et si tres-doulcement chantoient,\r\n       Qu'il n'est cueur qui n'ent fust ioyeulx.\r\n     Et en chantant en l'air montoient\r\n     Et puis l'un l'autre surmontoient\r\n       A l'estriuee a qui mieulx mieulx.\r\n\r\n     Le temps n'estoit mie mieulx.\r\n     De bleu estoient vestuz les cieux,\r\n       Et le beau Soleil cler luisoit.\r\n     Violettes croissoient par lieux\r\n     Et tout faisoit ses deuoirs tieux\r\n       Comme nature le duisoit.\r\n\r\n     OEUVRES DE CHARTIER, Paris, 1617, 4to. p. 594.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch is the lively description of a spring morning, in the opening of\r\nAlain Chartier's \"_Livre des quatre dames_;\" and, excepting the\r\nviolets, such description conveyed a pretty accurate idea of the\r\nscenery which presented itself, from the cabinet window, to the eyes\r\nof Lysander and Philemon.\r\n\r\nPHIL.

You are averse then to the study of bibliography?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. By no means. I have already told you of my passion for books,\r\nand cannot, therefore, dislike bibliography. I think, with Lambinet,\r\nthat the greater part of bibliographical works are sufficiently dry\r\nand soporific:[95] but I am not insensible to the utility, and even\r\nentertainment, which may result from a proper cultivation of\r\nit--although both De Bure and Peignot appear to me to have gone\r\ngreatly beyond the mark, in lauding this study as \"one of the most\r\nattractive and vast pursuits in which the human mind can be\r\nengaged.\"[96]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 95: _Recherches, &c., sur l'Origine de\r\n     l'Imprimerie_: Introd. p. x. Lambinet adds very justly,\r\n     \"L'art consiste à les rendre supportables par des objets\r\n     variés de littérature, de critique, d'anecdotes,\" &c.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 96: See the \"Discours sur la Science\r\n     Bibliographique,\" &c., in the eighth volume of De Bure's\r\n     _Bibl. Instruct._ and Peignot's _Dictionnaire Raisonné de\r\n     Biblilolgie_, [Transcriber's Note: Bibliologie] vol. i. p.\r\n     50. The passage, in the former authority, beginning \"Sans\r\n     cesse\"--p. xvj.--would almost warm the benumbed heart of a\r\n     thorough-bred mathematician, and induce him to exchange his\r\n     Euclid for De Bure!!]\r\n\r\nPHIL. But to know what books are valuable and what are worthless;\r\ntheir intrinsic and extrinsic merits; their rarity, beauty, and\r\nparticularities of various kinds; and the estimation in which they are\r\nconsequently held by knowing men--these things add a zest to the\r\ngratification we feel in even looking upon and handling certain\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. It is true, my good Philemon; because knowledge upon any\r\nsubject, however trivial, is more gratifying than total ignorance; and\r\neven if we could cut and string cherry-stones, like Cowper's rustic\r\nboy, it would be better than brushing them aside, without knowing that\r\nthey could be converted to such a purpose. Hence I am always pleased\r\nwith Le Long's reply to the caustic question of Father Malebranche,\r\nwhen the latter asked him, \"how he could be so foolish as to take such\r\npains about settling the date of a book, or making himself master of\r\ntrivial points of philosophy!\"--\"Truth is so delightful,\" replied Le\r\nLong, \"even in the most trivial matters, that we must neglect nothing\r\nto discover her.\" This reply, to a man who was writing, or had\r\nwritten, an essay upon truth was admirable. Mons. A.G. CAMUS, a good\r\nscholar, and an elegant bibliographer, [of whom you will see some\r\naccount in \"_Les Siecles Litteraires de la France_,\"] has, I think,\r\nplaced the study of bibliography in a just point of view; and to his\r\nobservations, in the first volume of the \"_Memoires de l'Institut\r\nNational_,\" I must refer you.[97]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 97: Lysander had probably the following passage\r\n     more particularly in recollection; which, it must be\r\n     confessed, bears sufficiently hard upon fanciful and\r\n     ostentatious collectors of books. \"[Il y a] deux sortes de\r\n     connoissance des livres: l'une qui se renferme presque\r\n     uniquement dans les dehors et la forme du livre, pour\r\n     apprécier, d'après sa date, d'après la caractère de\r\n     l'impression, d'après certaines notes, quelquefois seulement\r\n     d'après une erreur typographique, les qualités qui le font\r\n     ranger dans la classe des livres rares où curieux, et qui\r\n     fixent sa valeur pecuniaire: l'autre genre de connoissance\r\n     consiste à savoir quels sont les livres les plus propres à\r\n     instruire, ceux où les sujets sont le plus clairement\r\n     présentés et le plus profondement discutés; les ouvrages à\r\n     l'aide desquels il est possible de saisir l'origine de la\r\n     science, de la suivre dans ses développemens, d'atteindre le\r\n     point actuel de la perfection. Sans doute il seroit\r\n     avantageux que ces deux genres de connoisances fussent\r\n     toujours réunis: l'expérience montre qu'ils le sont\r\n     rairement; l'expérience montre encore que le premier des\r\n     deux genres a été plus cultivé que le second. Nous\r\n     possédons, sur l'indication des livres curieux et rares, sur\r\n     les antiquités et les bijoux litteraires, si l'on me permet\r\n     d'employer cette expression, des instructions meilleures que\r\n     nous n'en avons sur les livres propres à instruire\r\n     foncièrement des sciences. En recherchant la cause de cette\r\n     difference, on la trouvera peut-être dans la passion que des\r\n     hommes riches et vains ont montrée pour posséder des livres\r\n     sans être en état de les lire. Il a fallu créer pour eux une\r\n     sorte de bibliotheque composée d'objets qui, sous la forme\r\n     exterieure de livres, ne fussent réellement que des raretés,\r\n     des objets de curiosité, qu'on ne lit pas, mais que tantôt\r\n     on regarde avec complaisance, tantôt en montre avec\r\n     ostentation; et comme après cela c'est presque toujours le\r\n     goût des personnes en état de récompenser qui dirige le but\r\n     des travailleurs, on ne doit pas être surpris qu'on se soit\r\n     plus occupé d'indiquer aux hommes riches dont je parle, des\r\n     raretés à acquérir, ou de vanter celles qu'ils avoient\r\n     rassemblées, que de faciliter, par des indications utiles,\r\n     les travaux des hommes studieux dont on n'attendoit aucune\r\n     récompense.\" _Memoires de l'Institut_, vol. i. 664. See also\r\n     the similar remarks of Jardé, in the \"Précis sur les\r\n     Bibliotheques,\" prefixed to Fournier's _Dict. portatif de\r\n     Bibliographie_, edit. 1809.\r\n\r\n     Something like the same animadversions may be found in a\r\n     useful book printed nearly two centuries before: \"Non enim\r\n     cogitant quales ipsi, sed qualibus induti vestibus sint, et\r\n     quanta pompa rerum fortunæque præfulgeant--sunt enim omnino\r\n     ridiculi, qui in nuda librorum quantumvis selectissimorum\r\n     multitudine gloriantur, et inde doctos sese atque admirandos\r\n     esse persuadent.\" Draudius: _Bibliotheca Classica_, ed.\r\n     1611. Epist. ad. Lect. Spizelius has also a good passage\r\n     upon the subject, in his description of Book-Gluttons\r\n     (\"Helluones Librorum\"): \"cum immensa pené librorum sit\r\n     multitudo et varietas, fieri non potest, quin eorum opibus\r\n     ditescere desiderans (hæres), non assiduam longamque\r\n     lectionem adhibeat.\" _Infelix Literatus_, p. 296, edit.\r\n     1680, 8vo.]\r\n\r\nPHIL. I may want time, and probably inclination, to read these\r\nobservations: and, at any rate, I should be better pleased with your\r\nanalysis of them.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. That would lead me into a wide field indeed; and, besides, our\r\nfriend--who I see walking hastily up the garden--is impatient for his\r\nbreakfast; 'tis better, therefore, that we satisfy just now an\r\nappetite of a different kind.\r\n\r\nPHIL. But you promise to renew the subject afterwards?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. I will make no such promise. If our facetious friend LISARDO,\r\nwho is expected shortly to join us, should happen to direct our\r\nattention and the discourse to the sale of MALVOLIO'S busts and\r\nstatues, what favourable opportunity do you suppose could present\r\nitself for handling so unpromising a subject as bibliography?\r\n\r\nPHIL. Well, well, let us hope he will not come: or, if he does, let us\r\ntake care to carry the point by a majority of votes. I hear the gate\r\nbell ring: 'tis Lisardo, surely!\r\n\r\nThree minutes afterwards, Lisardo and myself, who met in the passage\r\nfrom opposite doors, entered the Cabinet. Mutual greetings succeeded:\r\nand, after a hearty breakfast, the conversation was more\r\nsystematically renewed.\r\n\r\nLIS. I am quite anxious to give you a description of the fine things\r\nwhich were sold at Malvolio's mansion yesterday! Amongst colossal\r\nMinervas, and pigmy fauns and satyrs, a magnificent set of books, in\r\nten or twelve folio volumes (I forget the precise number) in Morocco\r\nbinding, was to be disposed of.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. The Clementine and Florentine museums?\r\n\r\nLIS. No indeed--a much less interesting work. A catalogue of the\r\nmanuscripts and printed books in the library of the French king, Louis\r\nthe fifteenth. It was odd enough to see such a work in such a sale!\r\n\r\nPHIL. You did not probably bid ten guineas for it, Lisardo?\r\n\r\nLIS. Not ten shillings. What should I do with such books? You know I\r\nhave a mortal aversion to them, and to every thing connected with\r\nbibliographical learning.\r\n\r\nPHIL. That arises, I presume, from your profound knowledge of the\r\nsubject; and, hence, finding it, as Solomon found most pursuits,\r\n\"vanity of vanities, and vexation of spirit.\"\r\n\r\nLIS. Not so, truly! I have taken an aversion to it from mere whim and\r\nfancy: or rather from downright ignorance.\r\n\r\nPHIL. But I suppose you would not object to be set right upon any\r\nsubject of which you are ignorant or misinformed? You don't mean to\r\nsport _hereditary_ aversions, or hereditary attachments?\r\n\r\nLIS. Why, perhaps, something of the kind. My father, who was the best\r\ncreature upon earth, happened to come into the possession of a huge\r\nheap of catalogues of private collections, as well as of booksellers'\r\nbooks--and I remember, on a certain fifth of November, when my little\r\nhands could scarcely grasp the lamplighter's link that he bade me set\r\nfire to them, and shout forth--\"Long live the King!\"--ever since I\r\nhave held them in sovereign contempt.\r\n\r\nPHIL. I love the king too well to suppose that his life could have\r\nbeen lengthened by any such barbarous act. You were absolutely a\r\nlittle Chi Ho-am-ti, or Omar![98] Perhaps you were not aware that his\r\nmajesty is in possession of many valuable books, which are described\r\nwith great care and accuracy in some of these very catalogues.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 98: Pope, in his Dunciad, has treated the\r\n     conflagration of the two great ancient libraries, with his\r\n     usual poetical skill:\r\n\r\n          \"Far eastward cast thine eye, from whence the sun\r\n          And orient Science their bright course begun:\r\n          One god-like monarch all that pride confounds,\r\n          He, whose long wall the wandering Tartar bounds;\r\n          Heavens! what a pile! whole ages perish there,\r\n          And one bright blaze turns Learning into air.\r\n            Thence to the south extend thy gladden'd eyes;\r\n          There rival flames with equal glory rise,\r\n          From shelves to shelves see greedy Vulcan roll,\r\n          And lick up all their PHYSIC OF THE SOUL.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Chi Ho-am-ti, Emperor of China, the same who built the\r\n     great wall between China and Tartary, destroyed all the\r\n     books and learned men of that empire.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The caliph, Omar I. having conquered Egypt, caused his\r\n     general to burn the Ptolemean library, on the gates of which\r\n     was this inscription: '[Greek: PSYCHÊS IATREION]:'\r\n     'THE PHYSIC OF THE SOUL.'\" Warburton's note. The last editor\r\n     of Pope's works, (vol. v. 214.) might have referred us to\r\n     the very ingenious observations of Gibbon, upon the\r\n     probability of this latter event: see his \"_Decline and Fall\r\n     of the Roman Empire_,\" vol. ix. 440, &c.]\r\n\r\nLIS. The act, upon reflection, was no doubt sufficiently foolish. But\r\nwhy so warm upon the subject?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Let me defend Philemon; or at least account for his zeal. Just\r\nbefore you came in, he was leading me to give him some account of the\r\nRISE AND PROGRESS OF BIBLIOGRAPHY; and was fearful that, from your\r\nnoted aversion to the subject, you would soon cut asunder the thread\r\nof our conversation.\r\n\r\nLIS. If you can convert me to be an admirer of such a subject, or even\r\nto endure it, you will work wonders; and, unless you promise to do so,\r\nI know not whether I shall suffer you to begin.\r\n\r\nPHIL. Begin, my dear Lysander. A mind disposed to listen attentively\r\nis sometimes half converted. O, how I shall rejoice to see this\r\nbibliographical incendiary going about to buy up copies of the very\r\nworks which he has destroyed! Listen, I entreat you, Lisardo.\r\n\r\nLIS. I am all attention; for I see the clouds gathering in the south,\r\nand a gloomy, if not a showery, mid-day, promises to darken this\r\nbeauteous morning. 'Twill not be possible to attend the antiques at\r\nMalvolio's sale.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Whether the sun shine, or the showers fall, I will make an\r\nattempt--not to convert, but to state simple truths: provided you\r\n\"lend me your ears.\"\r\n\r\nPHIL. And our hearts too. Begin: for the birds drop their notes, and\r\nthe outlines of the distant landscape are already dimmed by the\r\ndrizzling rain.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. You call upon me as formally as the shepherds call upon one\r\nanother to sing in Virgil's eclogues. But I will do my best.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to the English nation--whatever may have been\r\nthe strictures of foreigners[99] upon the paucity of their\r\nbibliographico-literary works in the 16th century--that the earliest\r\nprinted volume upon the love and advantages of book-collecting was the\r\n_Philobiblion_[100] of RICHARD DE BURY; who was bishop of Durham at\r\nthe close of the 14th century, and tutor to Edward III. I will at\r\npresent say nothing about the merits and demerits of this short\r\ntreatise; only I may be permitted to observe, with satisfaction, that\r\nthe head of the same see, at the present day, has given many proofs of\r\nhis attachment to those studies, and of his reward of such merit as\r\nattracted the notice of his illustrious predecessor. It is with pain\r\nthat I am compelled to avow the paucity of publications, in our own\r\ncountry, of a nature similar to the _Philobiblion_ of De Bury, even\r\nfor two centuries after it was composed; but while Leland was making\r\nhis library-tour, under the auspices of that capricious tyrant Henry\r\nVIII., many works were planned _abroad_, which greatly facilitated the\r\nresearches of the learned.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 99: \"Anglica gens longe fuit negligentior in\r\n     consignandis ingeniorum monumentis; nihil enim ab illis\r\n     prodiit, quod mereatur nominari, cum tamen sint extentque\r\n     pene innumera ingeniossimæ gentis in omnibus doctrinis\r\n     scripta, prodeantque quotidie, tam Latina, quam vernacula\r\n     lingua, plura,\" Morhof: _Polyhist. Literar._ vol. i. 205,\r\n     edit. 1747.\r\n\r\n     Reimmannus carries his strictures, upon the jealousy of\r\n     foreigners at the success of the Germans in bibliography,\r\n     with a high hand: \"Ringantur Itali, nasum incurvent Galli,\r\n     supercilium adducant Hispani, scita cavilla serant Britanni,\r\n     frendeant, spument, bacchentur ii omnes, qui præstantiam\r\n     MUSARUM GERMANICARUM limis oculis aspiciunt,\" &c.--\"hoc\r\n     tamen certum, firmum, ratum, et inconcussum est, GERMANOS\r\n     primos fuisse in Rep. Literaria, qui Indices Librorum\r\n     Generales, Speciales et Specialissimos conficere, &c. annisi\r\n     sunt.\"--A little further, however, he speaks respectfully of\r\n     our James, Hyde, and Bernhard. See his ably-written _Bibl.\r\n     Acroamatica_, pp. 1, 6.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 100: \"_Sive de Amore Librorum._\" The first\r\n     edition, hitherto so acknowledged, of this entertaining\r\n     work, was printed at Spires, by John and Conrad Hist, in\r\n     1483, 4to., a book of great rarity--according to Clement,\r\n     vol. v. 435; Bauer (_Suppl. Bibl. Libr. Rarior_, pt. i.\r\n     276); Maichelius, p. 127; and Morhof, vol. i. 187. Mons. De\r\n     La Serna Santander has assigned the date of 1473 to this\r\n     edition: see his _Dict. Bibliog. Chois._ vol. ii. 257,--but,\r\n     above all, consult Clement--to whom Panzer, vol. iii. p. 22,\r\n     very properly refers his readers. And yet some of Clement's\r\n     authorities do not exactly bear him out in the\r\n     identification of this impression. Mattaire, vol. i. 449,\r\n     does not appear to have ever seen a copy of it: but, what is\r\n     rather extraordinary, Count Macarty has a copy of a Cologne\r\n     edition in 4to., of the date of 1473. No other edition of it\r\n     is known to have been printed till the year 1500; when two\r\n     impressions of this date were published at Paris, in 4to.:\r\n     the one by Philip for Petit, of which both Clement and\r\n     Fabricius (_Bibl. Med. et Inf. Ætat._ vol. i. 842, &c.) were\r\n     ignorant; but of which, a copy, according to Panzer, vol.\r\n     ii. 336, should seem to be in the public library at\r\n     Gottingen; the other, by Badius Ascensius, is somewhat more\r\n     commonly known. A century elapsed before this work was\r\n     deemed deserving of republication; when the country that had\r\n     given birth to, and the university that had directed the\r\n     studies of, its illustrious author, put forth an inelegant\r\n     reprint of it in 4to. 1599--from which some excerpts will be\r\n     found in the ensuing pages--but in the meantime the reader\r\n     may consult the title-page account of Herbert, vol. iii. p.\r\n     1408. Of none of these latter editions were the sharp eyes\r\n     of Clement ever blessed with a sight of a copy! See his\r\n     _Bibl. Curcuse_, &c. vol. v. 438.\r\n\r\n     The 17th century made some atonement for the negligence of\r\n     the past, in regard to RICHARD DE BURY. At Frankfort his\r\n     _Philobiblion_ was reprinted, with \"a Century of\r\n     Philological Letters,\" collected by Goldastus, in 1610,\r\n     8vo--and this same work appeared again, at Leipsic, in 1674,\r\n     8vo. At length the famous Schmidt put forth an edition, with\r\n     some new pieces, \"typis et sumtibus Georgii Wolffgangii\r\n     Hammii, Acad. Typog. 1703,\" 4to. Of this latter edition,\r\n     neither Maichelius nor the last editor of Morhof take\r\n     notice. It may be worth while adding that the subscription\r\n     in red ink, which Fabricius (_ibid._) notices as being\r\n     subjoined to a vellum MS. of this work, in his own\r\n     possession--and which states that it was finished at\r\n     Auckland, in the year 1343, in the 58th of its author, and\r\n     at the close of the 11th year of his episcopacy--may be\r\n     found, in substance, in Hearne's edition of Leland's\r\n     _Collectanea_, vol. ii. 385, edit. 1774.]\r\n\r\nAmong the men who first helped to clear away the rubbish that impeded\r\nthe progress of the student, was the learned and modest CONRAD GESNER;\r\nat once a scholar, a philosopher, and a bibliographer: and upon whom\r\nJulius Scaliger, Theodore Beza, and De Thou, have pronounced noble\r\neulogiums.[101] His _Bibliotheca Universalis_ was the first thing,\r\nsince the discovery of the art of printing, which enabled the curious\r\nto become acquainted with the works of preceding authors: thus\r\nkindling, by the light of such a lamp, the fire of emulation among his\r\ncontemporaries and successors. I do not pretend to say that the\r\n_Bibliotheca_ of Gesner is any thing like perfect, even as far as it\r\ngoes: but, considering that the author had to work with his own\r\nmaterials alone, and that the degree of fame and profit attached to\r\nsuch a publication was purely speculative, he undoubtedly merits the\r\nthanks of posterity for having completed it even in the manner in\r\nwhich it has come down to us. Consider Gesner as the father of\r\nbibliography; and if, at the sale of Malvolio's busts, there be one of\r\nthis great man, purchase it, good Lisardo, and place it over the\r\nportico of your library.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 101: His _Bibliotheca_, or _Catalogus Universalis,\r\n     &c._, was first printed in a handsome folio volume at\r\n     Zurich, 1545. Lycosthyne put forth a wretched abridgement of\r\n     this work, which was printed by the learned Oporinus, in\r\n     4to., 1551. Robert Constantine, the lexicographer, also\r\n     abridged and published it in 1555, Paris, 8vo.; and William\r\n     Canter is said by Labbe to have written notes upon Simler's\r\n     edition, which Baillet took for granted to be in existence,\r\n     and laments not to have seen them; but he is properly\r\n     corrected by De La Monnoye, who reminds us that it was a\r\n     mere report, which Labbe gave as he found it. I never saw\r\n     Simler's own editions of his excellent abridgement and\r\n     enlargement of it in 1555 and 1574; but Frisius published\r\n     it, with great improvements, in 1583, fol., adding many\r\n     articles, and abridging and omitting many others. Although\r\n     this latter edition be called the _edit. opt._ it will be\r\n     evident that the _editio originalis_ is yet a desideratum in\r\n     every bibliographical collection. Nor indeed does Frisius's\r\n     edition take away the necessity of consulting a supplement\r\n     to Gesner, which appeared at the end of the _Bibliothéque\r\n     Françoise_ of Du Verdier, 1584. It may be worth stating that\r\n     Hallevordius's _Bibliotheca Curiòsa_, 1656, 1687, 4to., is\r\n     little better than a supplement to the preceding work.\r\n\r\n     The _Pandects_ of Gesner, 1548, fol. are also well worth the\r\n     bibliographer's notice. Each of the 20 books, of which the\r\n     volume is composed, is preceded by an interesting dedicatory\r\n     epistle to some eminent printer of day. Consult Baillet's\r\n     _Jugemens des Savans_, vol. ii. p. 11. _Bibl. Creven._ vol.\r\n     v. p. 278; upon this latter work more particularly; and\r\n     Morhof's _Polyhistor. Literar._ vol. i. 197, and Vogt's\r\n     _Catalog. Libr. Rarior._, p. 164: upon the former. Although\r\n     the _Dictionnaire Historique_, published at Caen, in 1789,\r\n     notices the botanical and lexicographical works of Gesner,\r\n     it has omitted to mention these Pandects: which however, are\r\n     uncommon.]\r\n\r\nLIS. All this is very well. Proceed with the patriarchal age of your\r\nbeloved bibliography.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. I was about resuming, with observing that our BALE speedily\r\nimitated the example of Gesner, in putting forth his _Britanniæ\r\nScriptores_;[102] the materials of the greater part of which were\r\nsupplied by Leland. This work is undoubtedly necessary to every\r\nEnglishman, but its errors are manifold. Let me now introduce to your\r\nnotice the little work of FLORIAN TREFLER, published in 1560;[103]\r\nalso the first thing in its kind, and intimately connected with our\r\npresent subject. The learned, it is true, were not much pleased with\r\nit; but it afforded a rough outline upon which Naudæus afterwards\r\nworked, and produced, as you will find, a more pleasing and perfect\r\npicture. A few years after this, appeared the _Erotemata_ of MICHAEL\r\nNEANDER;[104] in the long and learned preface to which, and in the\r\ncatalogue of his and of Melancthon's works subjoined, some brilliant\r\nhints of a bibliographical nature were thrown out, quite sufficient to\r\ninflame the lover of book-anecdotes with a desire of seeing a work\r\nperfected according to such a plan: but Neander was unwilling, or\r\nunable, to put his design into execution. Bibliography, however, now\r\nbegan to make rather a rapid progress; and, in France, the ancient\r\nwriters of history and poetry seemed to live again in the\r\n_Bibliotheque Françoise_ of LA CROIX DU MAINE and DU VERDIER.[105] Nor\r\nwere the contemporaneous similar efforts of CARDONA to be despised: a\r\nman, indeed, skilled in various erudition, and distinguished for his\r\nunabating perseverance in examining all the MSS. and printed books\r\nthat came in his way. The manner, slight as it was, in which\r\nCardona[106] mentioned the Vatican library, aroused the patriotic\r\nardor of PANSA; who published his _Bibliotheca Vaticana_, in the\r\nItalian language, in the year 1590; and in the subsequent year\r\nappeared the rival production of ANGELUS ROCCHA, written in Latin,\r\nunder the same title.[107] The magnificent establishment of the\r\nVATICAN PRESS, under the auspices of Pope Sixtus V. and Clement VIII.\r\nand under the typographical direction of the grandson of Aldus,[108]\r\ncalled forth these publications--which might, however, have been\r\nexecuted with more splendour and credit.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 102: The first edition of this work, under the\r\n     title of \"_Illustrium maioris Britanniæ Scriptorum, hoc est,\r\n     Anglæ, Cambriæ, ac Scotiæ summarium, in quasnam centurias\r\n     divisum, &c._,\" was printed at Ipswich, in 1548, 4to.,\r\n     containing three supposed portraits of Bale, and a spurious\r\n     one of Wicliffe. Of the half length portrait of Bale, upon a\r\n     single leaf, as noticed by Herbert, vol. iii. 1457, I have\r\n     doubts about its appearance in all the copies. The above\r\n     work was again published at Basil, by Opornius, in 1559,\r\n     fol., greatly enlarged and corrected, with a magnificent\r\n     half length portrait of Bale, from which the one in a\r\n     subsequent part of this work was either copied on a reduced\r\n     scale, or of which it was the prototype. His majesty has\r\n     perhaps the finest copy of this last edition of Bale's\r\n     _Scriptores Britanniæ_, in existence.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 103: \"Les Savans n'ont nullemont été satisfaits des\r\n     règles prescrites par FLORIAN TREFFER (Trefler) le premièr\r\n     dont on connoisse un écrit sur ce sujet [de la disposition\r\n     des livres dans une bibliothèque].

The title is \"Methodus\r\n     Ordinandi Bibliothecam,\" Augustæ, 1560. The extreme rarity\r\n     of this book does not appear to have arisen from its\r\n     utility--if the authority quoted by Vogt, p. 857, edit.\r\n     1793, may be credited. Bauer repeats Vogt's account; and\r\n     Teisser, Morhof, and Baillet, overlook the work.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 104: It would appear, from Morhof, that NEANDER\r\n     meditated the publication of a work similar to the\r\n     _Pandects_ of Gesner; which would, in all probability, have\r\n     greatly excelled it. The \"_Erotemata Græcæ Linguæ_\" was\r\n     published at Basil in 1565, 8vo. Consult _Polyhist. Liter._\r\n     vol. i. 199: _Jugemens des Savans_, vol. iii. art. 887, but\r\n     more particularly Niceron's _Memoires des Hommes Illustres_,\r\n     vol. xxx. In regard to Neander, Vogt has given the title at\r\n     length (a sufficiently tempting one!) calling the work \"very\r\n     rare,\" and the preface of Neander (which is twice the length\r\n     of the work) \"curious and erudite.\" See his _Catalog.\r\n     Libror. Rarior._, p. 614, edit. 1793.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 105: LA CROIX DU MAINE'S book appeared toward the\r\n     end of the year 1584; and that of his coadjutor, ANTHONY\r\n     VERDIER, in the beginning of the subsequent year. They are\r\n     both in folio, and are usually bound in one volume. Of these\r\n     works, the first is the rarest and best executed; but the\r\n     very excellent edition of both of them, by DE LA MONNOYE and\r\n     JUVIGNY, in six volumes, 4to., 1772, which has realized the\r\n     patriotic wishes of Baillet, leaves nothing to be desired in\r\n     the old editions--and these are accordingly dropping fast\r\n     into annihilation. It would appear from an advertisement of\r\n     De Bure, subjoined to his catalogue of Count Macarty's\r\n     books, 1779, 8vo., that there were then remaining only\r\n     eleven copies of this new edition upon LARGE PAPER, which\r\n     were sold for one hundred and twenty livres. Claude Verdier,\r\n     son of Antony, who published a supplement to Gesner's\r\n     Bibliotheca, and a \"_Censio auctorum omnium veterum et\r\n     recentiorum_,\" affected to censure his father's work, and\r\n     declared that nothing but parental respect could have\r\n     induced him to consent to its publication--but consult the\r\n     _Jugemens des Savans_, vol. ii. 87-8, upon Claude's filial\r\n     affection; and Morhof's _Polyhist. Literar._, vol. i., 176,\r\n     concerning the \"Censio,\" &c.--\"misere,\" exclaims Morhof,\r\n     \"ille corvos deludit hiantes: nam ubi censuram suam exercet,\r\n     manifestum hominis phrenesin facile deprehendas!\" The\r\n     ancient editions are well described in _Bibl. Creven._, vol.\r\n     v., 277-8, edit. 1776--but more particularly by De Bure,\r\n     nos. 6020-1. A copy of the ancient edition was sold at\r\n     West's sale for 2_l._ 15_s._ See _Bibl. West._, No. 934.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 106: JOHN BAPTIST CARDONA, a learned and\r\n     industrious writer, and bishop of Tortosa, published a\r\n     quarto volume at Tarracona, in 1537, 4to.--comprehending the\r\n     following four pieces: 1. _De regia Sancti Lamentii\r\n     Bibliotheca_: 2. _De Bibliothecis_ (_Ex Fulvio Ursino_,) et\r\n     _De Bibliotheca Vaticana (ex Omphrii Schedis)_: 3. _De\r\n     Expurgandis hæreticorum propriis nominibus_: 4. _De\r\n     Dipthycis_. Of these, the first, in which he treats of\r\n     collecting all manner of useful books, and having able\r\n     librarians, and in which he strongly exhorts Philip II. to\r\n     put the Escurial library into good order, is the most\r\n     valuable to the bibliographer. Vogt, p. 224, gives us two\r\n     authorities to shew the rarity of this book; and Baillet\r\n     refers us to the _Bibliotheca Hispana_ of Antonio.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 107: MUTIUS PANZA'S work, under the title of\r\n     _Ragionamenti della Libraria Vaticana_, Rome, 1590, 4to.,\r\n     and ANGELUS ROCCHA'S, that of _Bibliotheca Apostolica\r\n     Vaticana, Rome_, 1591, 4to., relate rather to the ornaments\r\n     of architecture and painting, than to a useful and critical\r\n     analysis, or a numbered catalogue, of the books within the\r\n     Vatican library. The authors of both are accused by Morhof\r\n     of introducing quite extraneous and uninteresting matter.\r\n     Roccha's book, however, is worth possessing, as it is\r\n     frequently quoted by bibliographers. How far it may be\r\n     \"Liber valde quidem rarus,\" as Vogt intimates, I will not\r\n     pretend to determine. It has a plate of the Vatican Library,\r\n     and another of St. Peter's Cathedral. The reader may\r\n     consult, also, the _Jugemens des Savans_, vol. ii., p. 141.\r\n     My copy of this work, purchased at the sale of Dr. Heath's\r\n     books, has a few pasted printed slips in the margins--some\r\n     of them sufficiently curious.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 108: Consult Renouard's _L'Imprimerie des Alde_,\r\n     vol. ii., 122, &c. One of the grandest works which ever\r\n     issued from the Vatican press, under the superintendence of\r\n     Aldus, was the vulgate bible of Pope Sixtus V., 1590, fol.,\r\n     the copies of which, upon LARGE PAPER, are sufficiently well\r\n     known and coveted. A very pleasing and satisfactory account\r\n     of this publication will be found in the _Horæ Biblicæ_ of\r\n     Mr. Charles Butler, a gentleman who has long and justly\r\n     maintained the rare character of a profound lawyer, an\r\n     elegant scholar, and a well-versed antiquary and\r\n     philologist.]\r\n\r\nLet us here not forget that the celebrated LIPSIUS condescended to\r\ndirect his talents to the subject of libraries; and his very name, as\r\nBaillet justly remarks, \"is sufficient to secure respect for his\r\nwork,\" however slender it may be.[109] We now approach, with the\r\nmention of Lipsius, the opening of the 17th century; a period\r\nsingularly fertile in bibliographical productions. I will not pretend\r\nto describe, minutely, even the leading authors in this department.\r\nThe works of PUTEANUS can be only slightly alluded to, in order to\r\nnotice the more copious and valuable ones of POSSEVINUS and of\r\nSCHOTTUS;[110] men who were ornaments to their country, and whose\r\nliterary and bibliographical publications have secured to them the\r\ngratitude of posterity. While the labours of these authors were\r\nenriching the republic of literature, and kindling all around a love\r\nof valuable and curious books, the _Bibliotheca Historica_ of\r\nBOLDUANUS, and the _Bibliotheca Classica_ of DRAUDIUS[111] highly\r\ngratified the generality of readers, and enabled the student to\r\nselect, with greater care and safety, such editions of authors as were\r\ndeserving of a place in their libraries.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 109: LIPSIUS published his _Syntagma de\r\n     Bibliothecis_, at Antwerp, in 1603, 4to., \"in quo de ritibus\r\n     variis et antiquitatibus circa rem bibliothecariam agitur.\"\r\n     An improved edition of it, by Maderus, was printed at\r\n     Helmstadt, in 1666, 4to., with other curious bibliographical\r\n     opuscula. A third edition of it was put forth by Schmid, at\r\n     the same place, in 1702, 4to. Consult Morhof. _Poly. Lit._,\r\n     vol. i., 188.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 110: \"Scripsit et ERYCIUS PUTEANUS librum _De Usu\r\n     Bibliothecæ et quidem speciatim Bibliothecæ Ambrosianæ\r\n     Mediol._, in 8vo., 1606, editum, aliumque, cui titulus\r\n     _Auspicia Bibliothecæ Lovaniensis_, an. 1639, in 4to.\"\r\n     Morhof. \"It is true,\" says Baillet, \"that this Puteanus\r\n     passed for a gossipping sort of writer, and for a great\r\n     maker of little books, but he was, notwithstanding, a very\r\n     clever fellow.\" _Jugemens des Savans_, vol. ii., 150. In the\r\n     _Bibl. Crev._, vol. v., 311, will be found one of his\r\n     letters, never before published. He died in 1646. POSSEVINUS\r\n     published a _Bibliotheca selecta_ and _Apparatus sacer_--of\r\n     the former of which, the Cologne edition of 1607, folio, and\r\n     of the latter, that of 1608, are esteemed the most complete.\r\n     The first work is considered by Morhof as less valuable than\r\n     the second. The \"_Apparatus_\" he designates as a book of\r\n     rather extraordinary merit and utility. Of the author of\r\n     both these treatises, some have extolled his talents to the\r\n     skies, others have depreciated them in proportion. His\r\n     literary character, however, upon the whole, places him in\r\n     the first class of bibliographers. Consult the _Polyhist.\r\n     Literar._, vol. i., 175. He was one of the earliest\r\n     bibliographers who attacked the depraved taste of the\r\n     Italian printers in adopting licentious capital-initial\r\n     letters. Catherinot, in his _Art d'imprimer_, p. 3, makes\r\n     the same complaint: so Baillet informs us, vol. i., pt. i.,\r\n     p. 13, edit. 1725: vol. iii., pt. 1, p. 78. SCHOTTUS'S work,\r\n     _de Bibl. claris Hispaniæ viris, France_, 1608, 4to., is\r\n     forgotten in the splendour of Antonio's similar production;\r\n     but it had great merit in its day. _Jugemens des Savans_,\r\n     vol. ii., pt. 1, 132, edit. 1725.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 111: BOLDUANUS published a _Theological_ (Jenæ,\r\n     1614) and _Philosophico Philological_ (Jenæ, 1616), as well\r\n     as an _Historical_ (Lipsiæ, 1620), library; but the latter\r\n     work has the pre-eminence. Yet the author lived at too great\r\n     a distance, wanting the requisite materials, and took his\r\n     account chiefly from the Frankfort catalogues--some of which\r\n     were sufficiently erroneous. _Polyhist. Literar._ vol. i.,\r\n     199. See also the very excellent historical catalogue,\r\n     comprehending the 1st chap. of Meusel's new edition of\r\n     Struvius's _Bibl. Histor._, vol. i., p. 26. DRAUDIUS'S work\r\n     is more distinguished for its arrangement than for its\r\n     execution in detail. It was very useful, however, at the\r\n     period when it was published. My edition is of the date of\r\n     1611, 4to.: but a second appeared at Frankfort, in 1625,\r\n     4to.]\r\n\r\nThe name of DU CHESNE can never be pronounced by a sensible Frenchman\r\nwithout emotions of gratitude. His _Bibliotheca Historiarum Galliæ_\r\nfirst published in the year 1627, 8vo.--although more immediately\r\nuseful to foreigners than to ourselves, is nevertheless worth\r\nmentioning. Morhof, if I recollect aright, supposes there was a still\r\nlater edition; but he probably confused with this work the _Series\r\nAuctorum, &c. de Francorum Historia_;[112] of which two handsome folio\r\neditions were published by Cramoisy. French writers of bibliographical\r\neminence now begin to crowd fast upon us.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 112: The reader will find a good account of some\r\n     of the scarcer works of Du Chesne in Vogt's _Catalog.\r\n     Libror. Rarior._, p. 248, &c., and of the life and literary\r\n     labours of this illustrious man in the 7th volume of\r\n     Niceron's _Memoires des Hommes Illustres_.]\r\n\r\nLIS. But what becomes of the English, Spanish, and Italian\r\nbibliographers all this while?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. The reproach of Morhof is I fear too just; namely that,\r\nalthough we had produced some of the most learned, ingenious, and able\r\nmen in Europe--lovers and patrons of literature--yet our librarians,\r\nor university scholars, were too lazy to acquaint the world with the\r\ntreasures which were contained in the several libraries around\r\nthem.[113] You cannot expect a field-marshal, or a statesman in\r\noffice, or a nobleman, or a rich man of extensive connections,\r\nimmersed in occupations both pressing and unavoidable--doggedly to set\r\ndown to a _Catalogue Raisonné_ of his books, or to an analysis of the\r\ndifferent branches of literature--while his presence is demanded in\r\nthe field, in the cabinet, or in the senate--or while all his bells,\r\nat home, from the massive outer gate to the retired boudoir, are torn\r\nto pieces with ringing and jingling at the annunciation of\r\nvisitors--you cannot, I say, my good Lisardo, call upon a person, thus\r\noccupied, to produce--or expect from him, in a situation thus\r\nharassed, the production of--any solid bibliographical publication;\r\nbut you have surely a right to expect that librarians, or scholars,\r\nwho spend the greater part of their time in public libraries, will\r\nvouchsafe to apply their talents in a way which may be an honour to\r\ntheir patrons, and of service to their country.[114] Not to walk with\r\nfolded arms from one extremity of a long room (of 120 feet) to\r\nanother, and stop at every window to gaze on an industrious gardener,\r\nor watch the slow progress of a melancholy crow \"making wing to the\r\nrooky wood,\" nor yet, in winter, to sit or stand inflexibly before the\r\nfire, with a duodecimo jest book or novel in their hands--but to look\r\naround and catch, from the sight of so much wisdom and so much worth,\r\na portion of that laudable emulation with which the Gesners, the\r\nBaillets, and the Le Longs were inspired; to hold intimate\r\nacquaintance with the illustrious dead; to speak to them without the\r\nfear of contradiction; to exclaim over their beauties without the\r\ndread of ridicule, or of censure; to thank them for what they have\r\ndone in transporting us to other times, and introducing us to other\r\nworlds; and constantly to feel a deep and unchangeable conviction of\r\nthe necessity of doing all the good in our power, and in our way, for\r\nthe benefit of those who are to survive us!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 113: See the note at p. 29, ante. \"It is a pity,\"\r\n     says Morhof, \"that the _Dutch_ had such little curiosity\r\n     about the literary history of their country--but the\r\n     _English_ were yet more negligent and incurious.\"--And yet,\r\n     Germany, France, and Italy, had already abounded with\r\n     treasures of this kind!!]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 114: Senebier, who put forth a very useful and\r\n     elegantly printed catalogue of the MSS. in the public\r\n     library of Geneva, 1779, 8vo., has the following\r\n     observations upon this subject--which I introduce with a\r\n     necessary proviso, or caution, that _now-a-days_ his\r\n     reproaches cannot affect us. We are making ample amends for\r\n     past negligence; for, to notice no others, the labours of\r\n     those gentlemen who preside over the BRITISH MUSEUM\r\n     abundantly prove our present industry. Thus speaks Senebier:\r\n     'Ill sembleroit d'abord étonnant qu'on ait tant tradé à\r\n     composer le Catalogue des Manuscripts de la Bibliothéque de\r\n     Genéve; mais on peut faire plus raisonnablement ce reproche\r\n     aux Bibliothécaires bien payés et uniquement occupés de leur\r\n     vocation, qui sont les dépositaires de tant de collections\r\n     précieuses qu'on voit en Italie, en France, en Allemagne, et\r\n     en Angleterre; ils le mériteront d'autant mieux, qu'ils\r\n     privent le public des piéces plus précieuses, et qu'ils ont\r\n     plusieurs aids intelligens qui peuvent les dispenser de la\r\n     partie le plus méchanique et la plus ennuyeuse de ce\r\n     travail,' &c.]\r\n\r\nPHIL. Hear him, hear him![115]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 115: This mode of exclamation or expression, like\r\n     that of _cheering_ (vide p. 20, ante) is also peculiar to\r\n     our own country; and it is uttered by both friend and foe.\r\n     Thus, in the senate, when a speaker upon one side of the\r\n     question happens to put an argument in a strong point of\r\n     view, those of the same party or mode of thinking\r\n     exclaim--_hear him, hear him!_ And if he should happen to\r\n     state any thing that may favour the views, or the mode of\r\n     thinking, of his opponents, these latter also take advantage\r\n     of his eloquence, and exclaim, _hear him, hear him!_ Happy\r\n     the man whom friend and foe alike delight to hear!]\r\n\r\nLIS. But what is become, in the while, of the English, Italian, and\r\nSpanish bibliographers--in the seventeenth century?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. I beg pardon for the digression; but the less we say of these,\r\nduring this period, the better; and yet you must permit me to\r\nrecommend to you the work of PITSEUS, our countryman, which grows\r\nscarcer every day.[116] We left off, I think, with the mention of Du\r\nChesne's works. Just about this time came forth the elegant little\r\nwork of NAUDÆUS;[117] which I advise you both to purchase, as it will\r\ncost you but a few shillings, and of the aspect of which you may\r\ninform yourselves by taking it down from yonder shelf. Quickly\r\nafterwards CLAUDE CLEMENT, \"haud passibus æquis,\" put forth his\r\n_Bibliothecæ tam privatæ quam publicæ[118] extructio_, &c.; a work,\r\ncondemned by the best bibliographical judges. But the splendour of\r\nalmost every preceding bibliographer's reputation was eclipsed by that\r\narising from the extensive and excellent publications of LOUIS\r\nJACOB;[119] a name at which, if we except those of Fabricius and\r\nMuratori, diligence itself stands amazed; and concerning whose life\r\nand labours it is to be regretted that we have not more extended\r\ndetails. The harsh and caustic manner in which Labbe and Morhof have\r\ntreated the works of GADDIUS,[120] induce me only to mention his name,\r\nand to warn you against looking for much corn in a barn choked with\r\nchaff. We now approach the close of the seventeenth century; when,\r\nstopping for a few minutes only, to pay our respects to CINELLI,\r\nCONRINGIUS, and LOMEIER,[121] we must advance to do homage to the more\r\nillustrious names of Labbe, Lambecius, and Baillet; not forgetting,\r\nhowever, the equally respectable ones of Antonio and Lipenius.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 116: Pitseus's work \"_De Rebus Anglicis_,\" Paris,\r\n     1619, 4to., vol. i., was written in opposition to Bale's\r\n     (vid. p. 31, ante). The author was a learned Roman Catholic;\r\n     but did not live to publish the second volume. I was glad to\r\n     give Mr. Ford, of Manchester, 1_l._ 16_s._ for a stained and\r\n     badly bound copy of it.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 117: \"GABRIELE NAUDÆO nemo vixit suo tempore\r\n     [Greek: empeirias] Bibliothecariæ peritior:\" _Polyhist.\r\n     Liter._, vol. i., 187. \"Naudæi scripta omnia et singula\r\n     præstantissima sunt,\" Vogt, p. 611. \"Les ouvrages de Naudé\r\n     firent oublier ce qui les avoient précédé.\" Camus, _Mem. de\r\n     l'Institut._, vol. i., 646. After these eulogies, who will\r\n     refuse this author's \"_Avis pour dresser une Bibliothéque_,\r\n     Paris, 1627, 1644, 8vo.\" a place upon his shelf? Unluckily,\r\n     it rarely comes across the search of the keenest collector.\r\n     The other, yet scarcer, productions of Naudé will be found\r\n     well described in Vogt's _Catalog. Libror. Rarior._, p. 610.\r\n     The reader of ancient politics may rejoice in the possession\r\n     of what is called, the \"_Mascurat_\"--and \"_Considerations\r\n     politiques_\"--concerning which Vogt is gloriously diffuse;\r\n     and Peignot (who has copied from him, without\r\n     acknowledgement--_Bibliogr. Curieuse_, pp. 49, 50,) may as\r\n     well be consulted. But the bibliographer will prefer the\r\n     \"_Additions à l'Histoire de Louis XI._,\" 1630, 8vo., and\r\n     agree with Mailchelius that a work so uncommon and so\r\n     curious \"ought to be reprinted.\" See the latter's amusing\r\n     little book \"_De Præcipuis Bibliothecis Parisiensibus_,\" pp.\r\n     66, 67, &c. Naudæus was librarian to the famous Cardinal\r\n     Mazarin, the great Mæcenas of his day; whose library,\r\n     consisting of upwards of forty thousand volumes, was the\r\n     most beautiful and extensive one which France had then ever\r\n     seen. Its enthusiastic librarian, whom I must be allowed to\r\n     call a very wonderful bibliomaniac, made constant journeys,\r\n     and entered into a perpetual correspondence, relating to\r\n     books and literary curiosities. He died at Abbeville in\r\n     1653, in his 53rd year, on returning from Sweden, where the\r\n     famous Christian had invited him. Naudæus's \"_Avis, &c._\",\r\n     [ut supr.] was translated by Chaline; but his \"_Avis à\r\n     Nosseigneurs du Parlement, &c._\" 1652, 4to.--upon the sale\r\n     of the Cardinal's library--and his \"_Remise de la\r\n     Bihliothéque_ [Transcriber's Note: Bibliothèque] [Du\r\n     Cardinal] _entre le mains de M. Tubeuf_, 1651,\" are much\r\n     scarcer productions. A few of these particulars are gathered\r\n     from Peignot's _Dict. de la Bibliolologie_ [Transcriber's\r\n     Note: Bibliologie], vol. ii., p. 1--consult also his _Dict.\r\n     Portatif de Bibliographie_, p. v. In the former work I\r\n     expected a copious piece of biography; yet, short as it is,\r\n     Peignot has subjoined a curious note from Naudé's\r\n     \"_Considerations politiques_\"--in which the author had the\r\n     hardihood to defend the massacre upon St. Bartholomew's day,\r\n     by one of the strangest modes of reasoning ever adopted by a\r\n     rational being.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 118: This work, in four books, was published at\r\n     Lyons, 1635, 4to. If it be not quite \"Much ado about\r\n     nothing\"--it exhibits, at least, a great waste of ink and\r\n     paper. Morhof seems to seize with avidity Baillet's lively\r\n     sentence of condemnation--\"Il y a trop de babil et trop de\r\n     ce que nous appellons _fatras_,\" &c.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 119: Le Pere LOUYS JACOB published his \"_Traicté\r\n     des plus belles Bibliothéques publiques et particulières,\r\n     qui ont esté, et qui sont à présents dans le monde_,\" at\r\n     Paris, in 1644--again in 1655, 8vo.--in which he first\r\n     brought together the scattered notices relating to\r\n     libraries, especially to modern ones. His work is well worth\r\n     consultation; although Baillet and Morhof do not speak in\r\n     direct terms of praise concerning it--and the latter seems a\r\n     little angry at his giving the preference to the Parisian\r\n     libraries over those of other countries. It must be\r\n     remembered that this was published as an unfinished\r\n     production: as such, the author's curiosity and research are\r\n     highly to be commended. I have read the greater part of it\r\n     with considerable satisfaction. The same person meditated\r\n     the execution of a vast work in four folio volumes--called\r\n     \"_La Bibliothéque universelle de tous les Autheurs de\r\n     France, qui ont escrits en quelque sorte de sciences et de\r\n     langues_\"--which, in fact, was completed in 1638: but, on\r\n     the death of the author it does not appear what became of\r\n     it. Jacob also gave an account of books as they were\r\n     published at Paris, and in other parts of France, from the\r\n     year 1643 to 1650; which was printed under the title of\r\n     _Bibliographia Parisina_, Paris, 1651, 4to.

CONRINGIUS compiled a charming bibliographical\r\n     work, in an epistolary form, under the title of _Bibliotheca\r\n     Augusta_; which was published at Helmstadt, in 1661,\r\n     4to.--being an account of the library of the Duke of\r\n     Brunswick, in the castle of Wolfenbuttle.

LOMEIER'S, or Lomejer's \"_De Bibliothecis\r\n     Liber singularis_,\" Ultraj, 1669-1680, 8vo., is considered\r\n     by Baillet among the best works upon the subject of ancient\r\n     and modern libraries.

Pray discuss their works, or merits, _seriatim_, as the judges\r\ncall it; for I feel overwhelmed at the stringing together of such\r\ntrisyllabic names. These gentlemen, as well as almost every one of\r\ntheir predecessors, are strangers to me; and you know my bashfulness\r\nand confusion in such sort of company.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. I hope to make you better acquainted with them after a slight\r\nintroduction, and so rid you of such an uncomfortable diffidence. Let\r\nus begin with LABBE,[122] who died in the year 1667, and in the\r\nsixtieth of his own age; a man of wonderful memory and of as wonderful\r\napplication--whose whole life, according to his biographers, was\r\nconsumed in gathering flowers from his predecessors, and thence\r\nweaving such a chaplet for his own brows as was never to know decay.\r\nHis _Nova Bibliotheca_, and _Bibliotheca Bibliothecarum\r\nManuscriptorum_, are the principal works which endear his memory to\r\nbibliographers. More learned than Labbe was LAMBECIUS;[123] whose\r\n_Commentarii de Bibliotheca Cæsareâ-Vindobonensis_, with Nesselius's\r\nsupplement to the same, [1696, 2 vols. fol.] and Kollarius's new\r\nedition of both, form one of the most curious and important, as well\r\nas elaborate, productions in the annals of literature and\r\nbibliography. Less extensive, but more select, valuable, and accurate,\r\nin its choice and execution of objects, is the _Bibliotheca Hispana\r\nVetus et Nova_ of Nicholas ANTONIO;[124] the first, and the best,\r\nbibliographical work which Spain, notwithstanding her fine palaces and\r\nlibraries, has ever produced. If neither Philemon nor yourself,\r\nLisardo, possess this latter work [and I do not see it upon the\r\nshelves of this cabinet], seek for it with avidity; and do not fear\r\nthe pistoles which the purchase of it may cost you. LIPENIUS[125] now\r\nclaims a moment's notice; of whose _Bibliotheca Realis_ Morhof is\r\ninclined to speak more favourably than other critics. 'Tis in six\r\nvolumes; and it appeared from the years 1679 to 1685 inclusive. Not\r\ninferior to either of the preceding authors in taste, erudition, and\r\nthe number and importance of his works, was ADRIEN BAILLET;[126] the\r\nsimple pastor of Lardiéres, and latterly the learned and\r\nindefatigable librarian of Lamoignon. His _Jugemens des Savans_,\r\nedited by De la Monnoye, is one of those works with which no man, fond\r\nof typographical and bibliographical pursuits, can comfortably\r\ndispense. I had nearly forgotten to warn you against the capricious\r\nworks of BEUGHEM; a man, nevertheless, of wonderful mental elasticity;\r\nbut for ever planning schemes too vast and too visionary for the\r\nhuman powers to execute.[127]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 122: \"Vir, qui in texendis catalogis totam pene\r\n     vitam consumpsit.\" \"Homo ad Lexica et Catalogos conficiendos\r\n     a naturâ factus.\" Such is Morhof's account of LABBE; who, in\r\n     the works above-mentioned, in the text, has obtained an\r\n     unperishable reputation as a bibliographer. The _Bibliotheca\r\n     Bibliothecarum_, thick duodecimo, or crown octavo, has run\r\n     through several impressions; of which the Leipsic edit. of\r\n     1682, is as good as any; but TEISSER, in his work under the\r\n     same title, 1686, 4to., has greatly excelled Labbe's\r\n     production, as well by his corrections of errata as by his\r\n     additions of some hundreds of authors. The _Bibliotheca\r\n     Nummaria_ is another of Labbe's well-known performances: in\r\n     the first part of which he gives an account of those who\r\n     have written concerning medals--in the second part, of those\r\n     who have publishe [Transcriber's Note: published] separate\r\n     accounts of coins, weights, and measures. This is usually\r\n     appended to the preceding work, and is so published by\r\n     Teisser. The _Mantissa Suppellectilis_ was an unfinished\r\n     production; and the _Specimen novæ Bibliothecæ\r\n     Manuscriptorum Librorum_, Paris, 1653, 4to., is too\r\n     imperfectly executed for the exercise of rigid criticism;\r\n     although Baillet calls it 'useful and curious.' Consult the\r\n     _Polyhist. Literar._, vol. i., 197, 203: and _Jugemens des\r\n     Savans_, vol. ii., pt. 1, p. 24, edit. 1725. A list of\r\n     Labbe's works, finished, unfinished, and projected, was\r\n     published at Paris, in 1656 and 1662. He was joint editor\r\n     with Cossart of that tremendously voluminous work--the\r\n     \"Collectio Maxima Conciliorum\"--1672, 18 volumes, folio.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 123: LAMBECIUS died at, one may almost say, the\r\n     premature age of 52: and the above work (in eight folio\r\n     volumes), which was left unfinished in consequence, (being\r\n     published between the years 1665-79 inclusive) gives us a\r\n     magnificent idea of what its author would have accomplished\r\n     [see particularly Reimanni _Bibl. Acroamatica_, p. 51] had\r\n     it pleased Providence to prolong so valuable an existence.\r\n     It was originally sold for 24 _imperiali_; but at the\r\n     commencement of the 18th century for not less than 80\r\n     _thaleri_, and a copy of it was scarcely ever to be met\r\n     with. Two reasons have been assigned for its great rarity,\r\n     and especially for that of the 8th volume; the one, that\r\n     Lambecius's heir, impatient at the slow sale of the work,\r\n     sold many copies of it to the keepers of herb-stalls: the\r\n     other, that, when the author was lying on his death-bed, his\r\n     servant maid, at the suggestion and from the stinginess of\r\n     the same heir, burnt many copies of this eighth volume\r\n     [which had recently left the press] to light the fire in the\r\n     chamber. This intelligence I glean from Vogt, p. 495: it had\r\n     escaped Baillet and Morhof. But consult De Bure, vol. vi.,\r\n     Nos. 6004-5. Reimannus published a _Bibliotheca\r\n     Acroamatica_, Hanov., 1712, 8vo., which is both an\r\n     entertaining volume and a useful compendium of Lambecius's\r\n     immense work. But in the years 1766-82, KOLLARIUS published\r\n     a new and improved edition of the entire commentaries, in\r\n     six folio volumes; embodying in this gigantic undertaking\r\n     the remarks which were scattered in his \"_Analecta\r\n     Monumentorum omnis ævi Vindobonensia_,\" in two folio\r\n     volumes, 1761. A posthumous work of Kollarius, as a\r\n     supplement to his new edition of Lambecius's Commentaries,\r\n     was published in one folio volume, 1790. A complete set of\r\n     these volumes of Kollarius's bibliographical labours,\r\n     relating to the Vienna library, was in Serna Santander's\r\n     catalogue, vol. iv., no. 6291, as well as in Krohn's: in\r\n     which latter [nos. 3554, 3562] there are some useful\r\n     notices. See my account of M. Denis: post. Critics have\r\n     accused these \"Commentaries concerning the MSS. in the\r\n     imperial library at Vienna,\" as containing a great deal of\r\n     rambling and desultory matter; but the vast erudition,\r\n     minute research, and unabateable diligence of its author,\r\n     will for ever secure to him the voice of public praise, as\r\n     loud and as hearty as he has received it from his abridger\r\n     Reimannus. In these volumes appeared the first account of\r\n     the Psalter, printed at Mentz in 1457, which was mistaken by\r\n     Lambecius for a MS. The reader will forgive my referring him\r\n     to a little essay upon this and the subsequent Psalters,\r\n     printed at Mentz, in 1459, 1490, &c., which was published by\r\n     me in the 2nd volume of the _Athenæum_, p. 360, 490.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 124: Morhof considers the labours of ANTONIO as\r\n     models of composition in their way. His grand work began to\r\n     be published in 1672, 2 vols., folio--being the _Bibliotheca\r\n     Hispana Nova_: this was succeeded, in 1696, by the\r\n     _Bibliotheca Hispana Antiqua_--in two folio volumes: the\r\n     prefaces and indexes contain every thing to satisfy the\r\n     hearts of Spanish Literati. A new edition of the first work\r\n     was published at Madrid, in 1783, 2 vols., folio; and of the\r\n     latter work, in 1788, 2 vols., folio.--These recent editions\r\n     are very rarely to be met with in our own country: abroad,\r\n     they seem to have materially lowered the prices of the\r\n     ancient ones, which had become excessively scarce. See\r\n     _Polyhist Literar._, vol. i., 203-4: _Dictionn. Bibliogr._,\r\n     vol. iv., p. 22: and _Mem. de l'Inst._, vol. i., 651. Let us\r\n     here not forget the learned Michael CASIRI'S _Bibliotheca\r\n     Arabico-Hispana Escorialensis_, published in two superb\r\n     folio volumes at Madrid in 1760. All these useful and\r\n     splendid works place the Spaniards upon a high footing with\r\n     their fellow-labourers in the same respectable career. De La\r\n     Serna Santander tells us that Casiri's work is dear, and\r\n     highly respected by the Literati. See _Cap. de Santander_,\r\n     vol iv., no. 6296.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 125: The _Bibliotheca Realis_, &c., of LIPENIUS\r\n     contains an account of works published in the departments of\r\n     _Jurisprudence_, _Medicine_, _Philosophy_, and _Theology_:\r\n     of these, the _Bibliotheca Theologica_, et _Philosophica_,\r\n     are considered by Morhof as the best executed. The _Bibl.\r\n     Juridica_ was, however, republished at Leipsic in two folio\r\n     volumes, 1757, with considerable additions. This latter is\r\n     the last Leipsic reprint of it. Saxius notices only the\r\n     re-impressions of 1720, 1736, 1742. See his _Onomast. Lit._,\r\n     vol. v., 588. I will just notice the _Bibliotheca Vetus et\r\n     Recens_ of KOENIGIUS, 1678, folio--as chart-makers notice\r\n     shoals--to be avoided. I had long thrown it out of my own\r\n     collection before I read its condemnation by Morhof. Perhaps\r\n     the following account of certain works, which appear to have\r\n     escaped the recollection of Lysander, may not be\r\n     unacceptable. In the year 1653, Father RAYNAUD, whose\r\n     lucubrations fill 20 folio volumes, published a quarto\r\n     volume at Lyons, under the title of \"_Erotemata de malis ac\r\n     bonis Libris, deque justa aut injusta eorum conditione_;\"\r\n     which he borowed [Transcriber's Note: borrowed] in part from\r\n     the \"_Theotimus, seu de tollendis et expurgandis malis\r\n     libris_,\" (Paris, 1549, 8vo.) of Gabriel PUHTHERB. Of these\r\n     two works, if [Transcriber's Note: it] were difficult to\r\n     determine which is preferable. The bibliographer need not\r\n     deeply lament the want of either: consult the _Polyhist.\r\n     Literar._, vol. i., 177. In the year 1670, VOGLER published\r\n     a very sensible \"_Universalis in notitiam cujusque generis\r\n     bonorum Scriptorum Introductio_\"--of this work two\r\n     subsequent editions, one in 1691, the other in 1700, 4to.,\r\n     were published at Helmstadt. The last is the best; but the\r\n     second, to him who has neither, is also worth purchasing.\r\n     The seven dissertations \"_De Libris legendis_\" of BARTHOLIN,\r\n     Hafniæ, 1676, 8vo., are deserving of a good coat and a front\r\n     row in the bibliographer's cabinet. \"Parvæ quidem molis\r\n     liberest, sed in quo quasi constipata sunt utilissima de\r\n     libris monita et notitiæ ad multas disciplinas utiles.\" So\r\n     speaks Morhof.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 126: ADRIEN BAILLET was the eldest of seven\r\n     children born in a second marriage. His parents were in\r\n     moderate circumstances: but Adrien very shortly displaying a\r\n     love of study and of book-collecting, no means, compatible\r\n     with their situation, were left untried by his parents to\r\n     gratify the wishes of so promising a child. From his\r\n     earliest youth, he had a strong predilection for the church;\r\n     and as a classical and appropriate education was then easily\r\n     to be procured in France, he went from school to college,\r\n     and at seventeen years of age had amassed, in two fair sized\r\n     volumes, a quantity of extracts from clever works; which,\r\n     perhaps having Beza's example in his mind, he entitled\r\n     _Juvenilia_. His masters saw and applauded his diligence;\r\n     and a rest of only five hours each night, during two years\r\n     and a half of this youthful period, afforded Baillet such\r\n     opportunities of acquiring knowledge as rarely fall to the\r\n     lot of a young man. This habit of short repose had not\r\n     forsaken him in his riper years: \"he considered and treated\r\n     his body as an insolent enemy, which required constant\r\n     subjection; he would not suffer it to rest more than five\r\n     hours each night; he recruited it with only one meal a\r\n     day--drank no wine--never came near the fire--and walked out\r\n     but once a week.\" The consequence of this absurd regime was\r\n     that Baillet had ulcers in his legs, an erysipelatous\r\n     affection over his body, and was, in other respects,\r\n     afflicted as sedentary men usually are, who are glued to\r\n     their seats from morn till night, never mix in society, and\r\n     rarely breathe the pure air of heaven. These maladies\r\n     shortened the days of Baillet; after he had faithfully\r\n     served the LAMOIGNONS as a librarian of unparalleled\r\n     diligence and sagacity; leaving behind him a \"_Catalogue des\r\n     Matieres_,\" in 35 volumes folio. \"All the curious used to\r\n     come and see this catalogue: many bishops and magistrates\r\n     requested to have either copies or abridgments of it.\" When\r\n     Baillet was dragged, by his friend M. Hermant, from his\r\n     obscure vicarage of Lardiéres, to be Lamoignon's librarian,\r\n     he seems to have been beside himself for joy.--\"I want a man\r\n     of such and such qualities,\" said Lamoignon.--\"I will bring\r\n     one exactly to suit you,\" replied Hermant--\"but you must put\r\n     up with a diseased and repulsive exterior.\"--\"Nous avons\r\n     besoin de fond,\" said the sensible patron, \"la forme ne\r\n     m'embarasse point; l'air de ce pays, et un grain de sel\r\n     discret, fera le reste: il en trouvera ici.\" Baillet came,\r\n     and his biographer tells us that Lamoignon and Hermant\r\n     \"furent ravis de le voir.\" To the eternal honour of the\r\n     family in which he resided, the crazy body and nervous mind\r\n     of Baillet met with the tenderest treatment. Madame\r\n     Lamoignon and her son (the latter, a thorough bred\r\n     bibliomaniac; who, under the auspices of his master, soon\r\n     eclipsed the book celebrity of his father) always took a\r\n     pleasure in anticipating his wishes, soothing his\r\n     irritabilities, promoting his views, and speaking loudly and\r\n     constantly of the virtues of his head and heart. The last\r\n     moments of Baillet were marked with true Christian piety and\r\n     fortitude; and his last breath breathed a blessing upon his\r\n     benefactors. He died A.D. 1706, ætatis 56. Rest his ashes in\r\n     peace!--and come we now to his bibliographical publications.\r\n     His \"_Jugemens des Savans_,\" was first published in 1685,\r\n     &c., in nine duodecimo volumes. Two other similar volumes of\r\n     _Anti Baillet_ succeeded it. The success and profits of this\r\n     work were very considerable. In the year 1722, a new edition\r\n     of it in seven volumes, quarto, was undertaken and completed\r\n     by De La Monnoye, with notes by the editor, and additions of\r\n     the original author. The \"Anti Baillet\" formed the 8th\r\n     volume. In the year 1725, De La Monnoye's edition, with his\r\n     notes placed under the text--the corrections and additions\r\n     incorporated--and two volumes of fresh matter, including the\r\n     Anti Baillet--was republished at Amsterdam, in eight\r\n     duodecimo volumes, forming 16 parts, and being, in every\r\n     respect, the best edition of the _Jugemens des Savans_. The\r\n     curious, however, should obtain the portrait of Baillet\r\n     prefixed to the edition of 1722; as the copy of it in the\r\n     latter edition is a most wretched performance. These\r\n     particulars, perhaps a little too long and tedious, are\r\n     gleaned from the \"Abregé\" de la Vie de Baillet, printed in\r\n     the two last editions of the work just described.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 127: It will not be necessary to notice _all_ the\r\n     multifarious productions, in MS. and in print, of this\r\n     indefatigable bibliographer; who had cut out work enough for\r\n     the lives of ten men, each succeeding the other, and well\r\n     employed from morn 'till even, to execute. This is\r\n     Marchand's round criticism: _Dict. Hist._ vol. i., p. 100.\r\n     Beughem's _Incunabula Typographica_, 1688, 12mo., is both\r\n     jejune and grossly erroneous. The \"_Bibliographia Eruditorum\r\n     Critico-Curiosa_,\" 1689, 1701, 4 vols., 12mo., being an\r\n     alphabetical account of writers--extracts from whom are in\r\n     the public literary Journals of Europe from 1665 to\r\n     1700--with the title of their works--is Beughem's best\r\n     production, and if each volume had not had a separate\r\n     alphabet, and contained additions upon additions, the work\r\n     would have proved highly useful. His \"_Gallia Euridita_,\"\r\n     Amst., 1683, 12mo., is miserably perplexing. In addition to\r\n     Marchand, consult the _Polyhist. Literar._ of Morhof, vol.\r\n     i., p. 179; and the note therein subjoined.

You have at length reached the close of the 17th century; but my\r\nlimited knowledge of bibliographical literature supplies me with the\r\nrecollection of two names which you have passed over: I mean, THOMAS\r\nBLOUNT and ANTONY-A-WOOD. There is surely something in these authors\r\nrelating to editions of the works of the learned.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. You have anticipated me in the mention of these names. I had\r\nnot forgotten them. With the former,[128] I have no very intimate\r\nacquaintance; but of the latter I could talk in commendation till\r\ndinner time. Be sure, my good Lisardo, that you obtain _both_ editions\r\nof the _Athenæ Oxoniensis_.[129]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 128: Sir Thomas Pope Blount's \"_Censura\r\n     Celebriorum Authorum_,\" Londini, 1690, folio, is\r\n     unquestionably a learned work--the production of a rural and\r\n     retired life--\"Umbraticam enim vitam et ab omni strepitu\r\n     remotam semper in delitiis habui,\"--says its author, in the\r\n     preface. It treats chiefly of the most learned men, and\r\n     sparingly of the English. His \"_Remarks upon Poetry_,\"\r\n     Lond., 1694, 4to. (in English) is more frequently read and\r\n     referred to. It is a pity that he had not left out the whole\r\n     of what relates to the Greek and Latin, and confined himself\r\n     entirely to the English, poets. A life of Sir Thomas Pope\r\n     Blount will be found in the new edition of the _Biographia\r\n     Britannica_.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 129: The first, and, what Hearne over and over\r\n     again calls the genuine edition of the _Athenæ Oxoniensis_,\r\n     was published in two folio volumes, 1691, 1692. That a\r\n     _third_ volume was intended by the author himself may be\r\n     seen from Hearne's remarks in his _Thom. Caii. Vind. Antiq.\r\n     Oxon._, vol. i., p. xliii. For the character of the work\r\n     consult his _Rob. de Avesb._, pp. xxvi, xxxiii. After the\r\n     lapse of nearly half a century, it was judged expedient to\r\n     give a new edition of these valuable biographical memoirs;\r\n     and Dr. Tanner, afterwards bishop of St. Asaph, was selected\r\n     to be the editor of it. It was well known that Wood had not\r\n     only made large corrections to his own printed text, but had\r\n     written nearly _500_ new lives--his MS. of both being\r\n     preserved in the Ashmolean Museum. This new edition,\r\n     therefore, had every claim to public notice. When it\r\n     appeared, it was soon discovered to be a corrupt and garbled\r\n     performance; and that the genuine text of Wood, as well in\r\n     his correctness of the old, as in his compositions of the\r\n     new, lives, had been most capriciously copied. Dr. Tanner,\r\n     to defend himself, declared that Tonson \"would never let him\r\n     see one sheet as they printed it.\" This was sufficiently\r\n     infamous for the bookseller; but the editor ought surely to\r\n     have abandoned a publication thus faithlessly conducted, or\r\n     to have entered his caveat in the preface, when it did\r\n     appear, that he would not be answerable for the authenticity\r\n     of the materials: neither of which were done. He wrote,\r\n     however, an exculpatory letter to Archbishop Wake, which the\r\n     reader may see at length in Mr. Beloe's _Anecdotes of\r\n     Literature_, vol. ii., p. 304. Consult the life of the\r\n     author in Mr. Gutch's valuable reprint of Wood's \"_History\r\n     and Antiquities of the University of Oxford_,\" 1792, 4to., 2\r\n     vols.: also, Freytag's _Analect. Literar._, vol. ii., 1105.\r\n     I have great pleasure in closing this note, by observing\r\n     that Mr. Philip Bliss, of St. John's College, Oxford, is\r\n     busily engaged in giving us, what we shall all be glad to\r\n     hail, a new and faithful edition of Wood's text of the\r\n     _Athenæ Oxoniensis_, in five or six quarto volumes.]\r\n\r\nWe have now reached the boundaries of the 17th century, and are just\r\nentering upon the one which is past: and yet I have omitted to mention\r\nthe very admirable _Polyhistor. Literarius_ of MORHOF:[130] a work by\r\nwhich I have been in a great measure guided in the opinions pronounced\r\nupon the bibliographers already introduced to you. This work, under a\r\nsomewhat better form, and with a few necessary omissions and\r\nadditions, one could wish to see translated into our own language. The\r\nname of MAITTAIRE strikes us with admiration and respect at the very\r\nopening of the 18th century. His elaborate _Annales Typographici_ have\r\nsecured him the respect of posterity.[131] LE LONG, whose pursuits\r\nwere chiefly biblical and historical, was his contemporary; an able,\r\nsedulous, and learned bibliographer. His whole soul was in his\r\nlibrary; and he never spared the most painful toil in order to\r\naccomplish the various objects of his inquiry.[132] And here, my dear\r\nfriends, let me pay a proper tribute of respect to the memory of an\r\neminently learned and laborious scholar and bibliographer: I mean JOHN\r\nALBERT FABRICIUS. His labours[133] shed a lustre upon the scholastic\r\nannals of the 18th century; for he opened, as it were, the gates of\r\nliterature to the inquiring student; inviting him to enter the field\r\nand contemplate the diversity and beauty of the several flowers which\r\ngrew therein--telling him by whom they were planted, and explaining\r\nhow their growth and luxuriancy were to be regulated. There are few\r\ninstructors to whom we owe so much; none to whom we are more indebted.\r\nLet his works, therefore, have a handsome binding, and a conspicuous\r\nplace in your libraries: for happy is that man who has them at hand to\r\nfacilitate his inquiries, or to solve his doubts. While Fabricius was\r\nthus laudably exercising his great talents in the cause of ancient\r\nliterature, the illustrious name of LEIBNITZ[134] appeared as author\r\nof a work of essential utility to the historian and bibliographer. I\r\nallude to his _Scriptores Rerum Brunwicensium_, which has received a\r\nwell pointed compliment from the polished pen of Gibbon. After the\r\nsuccessful labours of Fabricius and Leibnitz, we may notice those of\r\nSTRUVIUS! whose _Historical Library_[135] should be in every\r\nphilological collection.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 130: DANIEL GEORGE MORHOF, professor of poetry,\r\n     eloquence, and history, was librarian of the University of\r\n     Khiel. He published various works, but the above--the best\r\n     edition of which is of the date of 1747--is by far the most\r\n     learned and useful--\"liber non sua laude privandus; cum\r\n     primus fere fuerit Morhofius qui hanc amoeniorum literarum\r\n     partem in meliorum redigerit.\" _Vogt._, pref. ix., edit.\r\n     1793. Its leading error is the want of method. His\r\n     \"_Princeps Medicus_,\" 1665, 4to., is a very singular\r\n     dissertation upon the cure of the evil by the royal touch;\r\n     in the efficacy of which the author appears to have\r\n     believed. His \"_Epistola de scypho vitreo per sonum humanæ\r\n     vocis rupto_,\" Kiloni, 1703, 4to.--which was occasioned by a\r\n     wine merchant of Amsterdam breaking a wine-glass by the\r\n     strength of his voice--is said to be full of curious matter.\r\n     Morhof died A.D. 1691, in his 53rd year: beloved by all who\r\n     knew the excellent and amiable qualities of his head and\r\n     heart. He was so laborious that he wrote during his meals.\r\n     His motto, chosen by himself,--PIETATE, CANDORE, PRUDENTIA,\r\n     should never be lost sight of by bibliomaniacs! His library\r\n     was large and select. These particulars are gleaned from the\r\n     _Dict. Historique_, Caen, 1789, vol. vi., p. 350.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 131: A compendious account of MAITTAIRE will be\r\n     found in the third edition of my _Introduction to the\r\n     Knowledge of rare and valuable Editions of the Greek and\r\n     Latin Classics_, vol. i., p. 148. See too Mr. Beloe's\r\n     _Anecdotes of Literature, &c._, vol iii., p. ix. The various\r\n     volumes of his _Annales Typographici_ are well described in\r\n     the _Bibl. Crevenn._, vol. v. p. 287. To these may be added,\r\n     in the bibliographical department, his _Historia\r\n     Stephanorum, vitas ipsorum ac libros complectens_, 1709,\r\n     8vo.--and the _Historia Typographorum aliquot Parisiensium\r\n     vitas et libros complectens_, 1717, 8vo.--Of these two\r\n     latter works, (which, from a contemporaneous catalogue, I\r\n     find were originally published at 4_s._ the common paper,)\r\n     Mr. T. Grenville has beautiful copies upon LARGE PAPER. The\r\n     books are rare in any shape. The principal merit of\r\n     Maittaire's _Annales Typographici_ consists in a great deal\r\n     of curious matter detailed in the notes; but the absence of\r\n     the \"lucidus ordo\" renders the perusal of these fatiguing\r\n     and unsatisfactory. The author brought a full and\r\n     well-informed mind to the task he undertook--but he wanted\r\n     taste and precision in the arrangement of his materials. The\r\n     eye wanders over a vast indigested mass; and information,\r\n     when it is to be acquired with excessive toil, is,\r\n     comparatively, seldom acquired. Panzer has adopted an\r\n     infinitely better plan, on the model of Orlandi; and if his\r\n     materials had been _printed_ with the same beauty with which\r\n     they appear to have been composed, and his annals had\r\n     descended to as late a period as those of Maittaire, his\r\n     work must have made us eventually forget that of his\r\n     predecessor. The bibliographer is, no doubt, aware that of\r\n     Maittaire's first volume there are two editions: why the\r\n     author did not reprint, in the second edition (1733), the\r\n     fac-simile of the epigram and epistle of Lascar prefixed to\r\n     the edition of the Anthology, 1496, and the Disquisition\r\n     concerning the ancient editions of Quintilian (both of which\r\n     were in the first edition of 1719), is absolutely\r\n     inexplicable. Maittaire was sharply attacked for this\r\n     absurdity, in the \"Catalogus Auctorum,\" of the \"_Annus\r\n     Tertius Sæcularis Inv. Art. Typog._,\" Harlem, 1741, 8vo., p.\r\n     11. \"Rara certe Librum augendi methodus! (exclaims the\r\n     author) Satis patet auctorem hoc eo fecisse concilio, ut et\r\n     primæ et secundæ Libri sui editioni pretium suum constaret,\r\n     et una æque ac altera Lectoribus necessaria esset.\" Copies\r\n     of the Typographical Antiquities by Maittaire, upon LARGE\r\n     PAPER, are now exceedingly scarce. The work, in this shape,\r\n     has a noble appearance. While Maittaire was publishing his\r\n     Typographical Annals, ORLANDI put forth a similar work under\r\n     the title of \"_Origine e Progressi della Stampa o sia dell'\r\n     Arte Impressoria, e Notizie dell' Opere stampate dall' Anno\r\n     1462, sino all' Anno 1500_.\" Bologna, 1722, 4to. Of this\r\n     work, which is rather a compendious account of the several\r\n     books published in the period above specified, there are\r\n     copies upon strong WRITING PAPER--which the curious prefer.\r\n     Although I have a long time considered it as superseded by\r\n     the labours of Maittaire and Panzer, yet I will not withhold\r\n     from the reader the following critique: \"Cet ouvrage doit\r\n     presque nécessairement être annexé à celui de Maittaire à\r\n     cause de plusieurs notices et recherches, qui le rendent\r\n     fort curieux et intéressant.\" _Bibl. Crevenn._, vol. v.,\r\n     286-7. As we are upon publications treating of Typography,\r\n     we may notice the \"_Annalium Typographicorum selecta quædam\r\n     capita_,\" Hamb., 1740, 4to., of LACKMAN; and HIRSCHIUS'S\r\n     supplement to the typographical labours of his\r\n     predecessors--in the \"_Librorum ab Anno I. usque ad Annum L.\r\n     Sec. xvi. Typis exscriptorum ex Libraria quadam\r\n     supellectile, Norimbergæ collecta et observata, Millenarius\r\n     I._\" &c. Noriberg, 1746, 4to. About this period was\r\n     published a very curious, and now uncommon, octavo volume,\r\n     of about 250 pages, by SEIZ; called \"_Annus Tertius\r\n     Sæcularis Inventæ Artis Typographicæ_,\" Harlem, 1741--with\r\n     several very interesting cuts relating to Coster, the\r\n     supposed inventor of the art of printing. It is a little\r\n     strange that Lysander, in the above account of eminent\r\n     typographical writers, should omit to mention\r\n     CHEVILLIER--whose _L'Origine de l'Imprimerie de Paris, &c._,\r\n     1694, 4to., is a work of great merit, and is generally found\r\n     upon every bibliographer's shelf. Baillet had supplied him\r\n     with a pretty strong outline, in his short account of\r\n     Parisian printers. All the copies of Chevillier's book,\r\n     which I have seen, are printed upon what is called Foxey\r\n     paper. I believe there are none upon LARGE PAPER. We may\r\n     just notice LA CAILLE'S _Histoire de l'Imprimerie et de la\r\n     Librarie_, 1689, 4to., as a work full of errors. In order\r\n     that nothing may be wanting to complete the typographical\r\n     collection of the curious, let the \"portraits of booksellers\r\n     and printers, from ancient times to our own,\" published at\r\n     Nuremberg, in 1726, folio--and \"the Devices and Emblems\" of\r\n     the same, published at the same place, in 1730, folio, be\r\n     procured, if possible. The Latin titles of these two latter\r\n     works, both by SCHOLTZIUS, will be found in the _Bibl.\r\n     Crevenn._ vol. v. 281. Renouard mentions the last in his\r\n     \"_Annales de l'Imprimerie des Alde_,\" vol. ii. p. 63.\r\n     Meanwhile the _Monumenta Typographica_ of WOLFIUS, Hamb.,\r\n     1740, 2 vols., 8vo., embraces a number of curious and\r\n     scattered dissertations upon this interesting and valuable\r\n     art. It may be obtained for 8_s._ or 10_s._ at present! The\r\n     _Amoenitatus [Transcriber's Note: Amoenitates]\r\n     Literariæ, &c._, of SCHELHORN had like to have been passed\r\n     over. It was published in 14 small octavo volumes, at\r\n     Frankfort and Leipsic, from the year 1725 to 1731 inclusive.\r\n     The _Amoenitates Historiæ Ecclesiasticæ et Literariæ_, of\r\n     the same person, and published at the same place in two\r\n     octavo volumes, 1738, should accompany the foregoing work.\r\n     Both are scarce and sought after in this country. In the\r\n     former there are some curious dissertations, with cuts, upon\r\n     early printed books. Concerning the most ancient edition of\r\n     the Latin Bibles, Schelhorn put forth an express treatise,\r\n     which was published at Ulm in 1760, 4to. This latter work is\r\n     very desirable to the curious in biblical researches, as one\r\n     meets with constant mention of Schelhorn's bible. Let me not\r\n     omit ZAPF'S _Annales Typographiæ Augustanæ_, Aug. Vindel.,\r\n     1778; which was republished, with copious additions, at\r\n     Augsbourg, in two parts, 1786, 4to.--but unluckily, this\r\n     latter is printed in the German language. Upon Spanish\r\n     Typography (a very interesting subject), there is a\r\n     dissertation by Raymond Diosdado Caballero, entitled \"_De\r\n     Prima Typographiæ Hispanicæ Ætate Specimen_,\" Rome, 1793,\r\n     4to.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 132: From the Latin life of LE LONG, prefixed to\r\n     his _Bibliotheca Sacra_, we learn that he was an adept in\r\n     most languages, ancient and modern; and that \"in that part\r\n     of literature connected with BIBLIOGRAPHY (Typographorum et\r\n     Librorum Historia), he retained every thing so correctly in\r\n     his memory that he yielded to few literary men, certainly to\r\n     no bookseller.\" Of the early years of such a man it is a\r\n     pity that we have not a better account. His _Bibliotheca\r\n     Sacra_, Paris, 1725, folio, has been republished by MASCH\r\n     and BOERNER, in four volumes, 4to., 1778, and enriched with\r\n     copious and valuable additions. This latter work is quite\r\n     unrivalled: no young or old theologian, who takes any\r\n     interest in the various editions of the Holy Scriptures, in\r\n     almost all languages, can possibly dispense with such a fund\r\n     of sacred literature. The _Bibliothéque Historique de la\r\n     France_, 1719, folio, by the same learned and industrious\r\n     bibliographer, has met with a fate equally fortunate.\r\n     FONTETTE republished it in 1768, in five folio volumes, and\r\n     has immortalized himself and his predecessor by one of the\r\n     most useful and splendid productions that ever issued from\r\n     the press. De Bure used to sell copies of it upon LARGE\r\n     PAPER, in sheets, for 258 livres: according to the\r\n     advertisement subjoined to his catalogue of Count Macarty's\r\n     books in 1779, 8vo. The presses of England, which groan too\r\n     much beneath the weight of ephemeral travels and trumpery\r\n     novels, are doomed, I fear, long to continue strangers to\r\n     such works of national utility.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 133: The chief labours of Fabricius (\"Vir [Greek:\r\n     ellênichôtatos]\"--as Reimannus truly calls him), connected\r\n     with the present object of our pursuit, have the following\r\n     titles: 1. \"_Bibliotheca Græca, sive Notitia Scriptorum\r\n     Græcorum, &c._,\" Hamb. 1705-8-14-18, &c., 4to., 14 vols.--of\r\n     which a new edition is now published by HARLES, with great\r\n     additions, and a fresh arrangement of the original matter:\r\n     twelve volumes have already been delivered to the public. 2.\r\n     _Bibliotheca Latina_; first published in one volume,\r\n     1703--then in three volumes, 1721, and afterwards in two\r\n     volumes, 1728, 4to.;--but the last and best edition is that\r\n     of 1773, in three vols. 8vo., published by Ernesti at\r\n     Leipsic--and yet not free from numerous errors. 3.\r\n     _Bibliographia Antiquaria_, 1716, 4to.: a new edition of\r\n     Schaffshausen, in 1760, 4to., has superseded the old one. A\r\n     work of this kind in our own language would be very useful,\r\n     and even entertaining. Fabricius has executed it in a\r\n     masterly manner. 4. _Bibliotheca Ecclesiastica, in quâ\r\n     continentur variorum authorum tractatus de scriptoribus\r\n     ecclesiasticis_, Hamb., 1718, folio. An excellent work; in\r\n     which the curious after theological tracts and their authors\r\n     will always find valuable information. It is generally\r\n     sharply contended for at book-auctions. 5. _Bibliotheca\r\n     Latina Mediæ et Infimæ Ætatis, &c._, Leipsic, 1734, 6 vols.\r\n     8vo.--again, with Schoettgenius's supplement, in 1754, 4to.,\r\n     6 vols. in 3. This latter is in every respect the best\r\n     edition of a work which is absolutely indispensable to the\r\n     philologist. A very excellent synopsis or critical account\r\n     of Fabricius's works was published at Ams., 1738, in 4to.,\r\n     which the student should procure. Let me here recommend the\r\n     _Historia Bibliothecæ Fabricianæ_, compiled by JOHN\r\n     FABRICIUS, 1717-24, 6 vols. 4to., as a necessary and\r\n     interesting supplement to the preceding works of John Albert\r\n     Fabricius. I have often gleaned some curious bibliographical\r\n     intelligence from its copious pages. The reader may consult\r\n     _Bibl. Crevenn._, vol. v., 272-3.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 134: He is noticed here only as the author of\r\n     \"_Idea Bibliothecæ Publicæ secundum classes scientiarum\r\n     ordinandæ, fusior et contractior_,\" and of the \"_Scriptores\r\n     Rerum Brunswicarum_,\" Hanov., 1707, fol., 3 vols. \"The\r\n     antiquarian, who blushes at his alliance with Thomas Hearne,\r\n     will feel his profession ennobled by the name of LEIBNITZ.\r\n     That extraordinary genius embraced and improved the whole\r\n     circle of human science; and, after wrestling with Newton\r\n     and Clark in the sublime regions of geometry and\r\n     metaphysics, he could descend upon earth to examine the\r\n     uncouth characters and barbarous Latin of a chronicle or\r\n     charter.\" Gibbon: _Post.

His\r\n     \"_Bibliotheca Librorum Rariorum_\" was published in 1719,\r\n     4to. The first edition of the _Bibliotheca Historica_\r\n     appeared as early as 1705: a very valuable one was published\r\n     by Buder, in 1740, 2 vols.: but the last, and by far the\r\n     most copious and valuable, is that which exhibits the joint\r\n     editorial labours of BUDER and MEUSEL, in eleven octavo\r\n     volumes, 1782, 1802--though I believe it does not contain\r\n     every thing which may be found in the edition of the _Bibl.\r\n     Hist. Selecta_, by Jugler, 1754, three vols. 8vo.: vide pp.\r\n     iv. and vii. of the preface of Meusel's edition. The _Bibl.\r\n     Hist.

Jugler's edition of it contains a stiff\r\n     portrait of himself in a finely embroidered satin waistcoat.\r\n     The first volume, relating to foreign libraries, is very\r\n     interesting: but, unluckily, the work is rare.

You are advancing towards the middle of the 18th century, in\r\nenumerating foreign publications, without calling to mind that we\r\nhave, at home, many laudable publications relating to typography and\r\nbibliography, which merit at least some notice, if not commendation.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. I thank you for the reproof. It is true, I was running\r\nprecipitately to introduce a crowd of foreigners to your notice,\r\nwithout paying my respects, by the way, to the _Historical Libraries_\r\nof Bishop NICOLSON, the _Bibliotheca Literaria_ of WASSE, and the\r\n_Librarian_ of WILLIAM OLDYS. Nor should I omit to mention the still\r\nmore creditable performance of Bishop TANNER: while the typographical\r\npublications of WATSON, PALMER, and MIDDLETON,[136] may as well be\r\nadmitted into your libraries, if you are partial to such works;\r\nalthough upon this latter subject, the elegant quarto volume of AMES\r\nmerits particular commendation.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 136: Let us go gently over this _British_ ground,\r\n     which Lysander depictures in rather a flowery manner. The\r\n     first edition of BISHOP NICOLSON'S _English Historical\r\n     Library_ was published in the years 1696, 1697, and\r\n     1699--comprehending the entire three parts. In 1702, came\r\n     forth the _Scottish_ Historical library; and in 1724, the\r\n     _Irish_ Historical Library. These three libraries, with the\r\n     author's letter to Bishop Kennet in defence of the same, are\r\n     usually published in one volume; and the last and best\r\n     editions of the same are those of 1736, fol., and 1776, 4to.\r\n     Mr. John Nichols has recently published an entertaining\r\n     posthumous work of the bishop's _Epistolary Correspondence_,\r\n     in two octavo volumes, 1809. Some of these letters throw\r\n     light and interest upon the literature of the times. As to\r\n     the authority of Bishop Nicolson, in his historical matters,\r\n     I fear the sharp things which are said of his libraries by\r\n     Tyrrell (Pref. to _Hist. Engl._, vol. ii., p. 5.), and Wood\r\n     (_Athen. Brit._, vol. ii., col. 980, ed. 1721), all which\r\n     authorities are referred to by Mr. Nichols, are sufficiently\r\n     founded upon truth. He was a violent and wrong-headed writer\r\n     in many respects; but he had acumen, strength, and fancy.\r\n     The _Bibliotheca Literaria_ of WASSE (although his name does\r\n     not appear as the professed editor) is a truly solid and\r\n     valuable publication; worthy of the reputation of the\r\n     learned editor of Sallust. The work was published in\r\n     numbers, which were sold at one shilling each; but, I\r\n     suppose from the paucity of classical readers, it could not\r\n     be supported beyond the 10th number (1724); when it ceased\r\n     to be published. Some of the dissertations are very\r\n     interesting as well as erudite. OLDYS'S _British Librarian_\r\n     was published in six numbers, during the first six months of\r\n     the year 1737; forming, with the index, an octavo volume of\r\n     402 pages. It is difficult to say, from the conclusion (p.\r\n     373-4), whether the work was dropped for want of\r\n     encouragement, or from the capriciousness or indolence of\r\n     the author: but I suspect that the ground was suffered \"to\r\n     lie fallow\" (to use his own words) till it was suffocated\r\n     with weeds--owing to the _former_ cause: as Oldys never\r\n     suffered his pen to lie idle while he could \"put money in\r\n     his purse\" from his lucubrations. We shall speak of him more\r\n     particularly in PART V. Meanwhile, the reader is informed\r\n     that the _British Librarian_ is a work of no common\r\n     occurrence, or mean value. It is rigidly correct, if not\r\n     very learned, in bibliographical information. I once sent\r\n     three guineas to procure a copy of it, according to its\r\n     description, upon LARGE PAPER; but, on its arrival, I found\r\n     it to be not quite so large as my own tolerably\r\n     amply-margined copy. Bishop TANNER'S _Bibliotheca\r\n     Britanico-Hibernica_, which cost the author forty years'\r\n     labour, was published in 1748, folio; with a preface by Dr.\r\n     Wilkins. We must receive it with many thanks, imperfect and\r\n     erroneous as many parts of it are; but I hope the period is\r\n     not very remote when a literary friend, living, as he\r\n     constantly is, in an inexhaustible stock of British\r\n     literature of all kinds, will give us a new edition, with\r\n     copious additions and corrections, translated into our\r\n     native tongue. _The History of the Art of Printing_ by\r\n     WATSON, Edit., 1713, 8vo., is at best but a meagre\r\n     performance. It happens to be rare, and, therefore,\r\n     bibliomaniacs hunt after it. My copy of it, upon LARGE\r\n     PAPER, cost me 1_l._ 8_s._ It was formerly Paton's, of\r\n     Edinburgh, a knowing antiquary in Scottish printing. The\r\n     _History of Printing_, by PALMER, 1733, 4to., and Dr.\r\n     MIDDLETON'S _Dissertations upon the same_, 1735, 4to., have\r\n     been particularly treated by me, as well as the similar\r\n     works of AMES and HERBERT, in the first volume of my new\r\n     edition of Herbert's _British Typographical Antiquities_;\r\n     and the public is too well acquainted with the merits and\r\n     demerits of each to require their being pointed out in the\r\n     present place. I will close this note by observing that the\r\n     _Censuria Literaria_, in ten volumes octavo; and the\r\n     _British Bibliographer_ (now publishing) which grew out of\r\n     it; Mr. BELOE'S _Anecdotes of Literature and Scarce Books_,\r\n     six volumes, 8vo.; and Mr. Savage's continuation of _The\r\n     British Librarian_; are works which render the list of\r\n     English publications, relating to typography and curious\r\n     books, almost complete. I believe I may safely affirm that\r\n     the period is not very distant when some of these latter\r\n     publications, from the comparatively few copies which were\r\n     struck off, will become very rare.]\r\n\r\nLIS. I am glad to hear such handsome things said of the performances\r\nof our own countrymen. I was fearful, from your frequent sly\r\nallusions, that we had nothing worth mentioning. But proceed with your\r\nGermans, Italians, and Frenchmen.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. You draw too severe a conclusion. I have made no sly\r\nallusions. My invariable love of truth impels me to state facts as\r\nthey arise. That we have philosophers, poets, scholars, divines,\r\nlovers and collectors of books, equal to those of any nation upon\r\nearth is most readily admitted. But bibliography has never been, till\r\nnow, a popular (shall I say fashionable?) pursuit amongst the English.\r\n\r\nLIS. Well, if what you call bibliography has produced such eminent\r\nmen, and so many useful works, as those which have been just\r\nenumerated, I shall begin to have some little respect for this\r\ndepartment of literature; and, indeed, I already feel impatient to go\r\nthrough the list of your bibliographical heroes.--Who is the next\r\nchampion deserving of notice?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. This confession gives me sincere pleasure. Only indulge me in\r\nmy rambling manner of disquisition, and I will strive to satisfy you\r\nin every reasonable particular.\r\n\r\nIf ever you should be disposed to form a bibliographical collection,\r\ndo not omit securing, when it comes across you, the best edition of Du\r\nFresnoy's[137] _Methode pour étudier l'Histoire_: it is rare, and\r\nsought after in this country. And now--softly approach, and gently\r\nstrew the flowers upon, the tomb of worthy NICERON:[138] Low lies the\r\nhead, and quiescent has become the pen, of this most excellent and\r\nlearned man!--whose productions have furnished biographers with some\r\nof their choicest materials, and whose devotion to literature and\r\nhistory has been a general theme of admiration and praise. The mention\r\nof this illustrious name, in such a manner, has excited in my mind a\r\nparticular train of ideas. Let me, therefore, in imagination, conduct\r\nyou both to yonder dark avenue of trees--and, descending a small\r\nflight of steps, near the bottom of which gushes out a salient\r\nstream--let us enter a spacious grotto, where every thing is cool and\r\nsilent; and where small alabaster busts, of the greater number of\r\nthose bibliographers I am about to mention, decorate the niches on\r\neach side of it. How tranquil and how congenial is such a resting\r\nplace!--But let us pursue our inquires. Yonder sharp and well turned\r\ncountenances, at the entrance of the grotto, are fixed there as\r\nrepresentations of CARDINAL QUIRINI[139] and GOUJET; the _Bibliothéque\r\nFrançoise_ of the latter of whom--with which I could wish book\r\ncollectors, in general, to have a more intimate acquaintance--has\r\nobtained universal reputation.[140] Next to him, you may mark the\r\namiable and expressive features of DAVID CLEMENT:[141] who, in his\r\n_Bibliothéque Curieuse_, has shown us how he could rove, like a bee,\r\nfrom flower to flower; sip what was sweet; and bring home his\r\ngleanings to a well-furnished hive. The principal fault of this bee\r\n(if I must keep up the simile) is that he was not sufficiently choice\r\nin the flowers which he visited; and, of course, did not always\r\nextract the purest honey. Nearly allied to Clement in sprightliness,\r\nand an equally gossipping bibliographer, was PROSPER MARCHAND;[142]\r\nwhose works present us with some things no where else to be found,\r\nand who had examined many curious and rare volumes; as well as made\r\nhimself thoroughly acquainted with the state of bibliography previous\r\nto his own times.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 137: The last edition of this work is the one\r\n     which was printed in fifteen volumes, crown 8vo., at Paris,\r\n     1772: with a copious index--and proportionable improvements\r\n     in corrections and additions. It is now rare. I threw out\r\n     the old edition of 1729, four vols., 4to., upon LARGE PAPER;\r\n     and paid three guineas to boot for the new one, neatly\r\n     bound.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 138: It is quite delightful to read the account,\r\n     in the _Dict. Hist._, published at Caen, 1789, (vol. vi., p.\r\n     475) of JEAN PIERRE NICERON; whose whole life seems to have\r\n     been devoted to bibliography and literary history. Frank,\r\n     amiable, industrious, communicative, shrewd, and\r\n     learned--Niceron was the delight of his friends, and the\r\n     admiration of the public. His \"_Memoires pour servir à\r\n     l'Histoire des Hommes Illustres, &c., avec un Catalogue\r\n     raisonné de leur Ouvrages_,\" was published from the years\r\n     1729 to 1740, in forty crown 8vo. volumes. A supplement of\r\n     three volumes, the latter of which is divided into _two\r\n     parts_, renders this very useful, and absolutely necessary,\r\n     work complete in 44 volumes. The bibliomaniac can never\r\n     enjoy perfect rest till he is in possession of it!]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 139: QUIRINI published his \"_Specimen variæ\r\n     Literaturæ quæ in urbe Brixiæ ejusque Ditione paulo post\r\n     Typographiæ incunabula florebat_,\" _&c._, at Brescia, in\r\n     1739; two vols., 8vo.: then followed \"_Catalogo delle Opere\r\n     del Cardinale Quirini uscite alla luce quasi tuttee da'\r\n     Torchi di mi Gian Maria Rizzardi Stampatore in Brescia_,\"\r\n     8vo. In 1751, Valois addressed to him his \"_Discours sur les\r\n     Bibliothéques Publiques_,\" in 8vo.: his Eminence's reply to\r\n     the same was also published in 8vo. But the Cardinal's chief\r\n     reputation, as a bibliographer, arises from the work\r\n     entitled \"_De Optimorum Scriptorum Editionibus_.\" Lindaugiæ,\r\n     1761, 4to. This is Schelhorn's edition of it, which is\r\n     chiefly coveted, and which is now a rare book in this\r\n     country. It is a little surprising that Lysander, in his\r\n     love of grand national biographical works, mingled with\r\n     bibliographical notices, should have omitted to mention the\r\n     _Bibliotheca Lusitana_ of Joaov and Barbosa, published at\r\n     Lisbon, 1741, in four magnificent folio volumes. A lover of\r\n     Portuguese literature will always consider this as \"opus\r\n     splendidissimum et utilissimum.\"]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 140: _La Bibliothéque Françoise, ou Histoire de la\r\n     Littérature Françoise_, of CLAUDE PIERRE GOUJET, in eighteen\r\n     volumes, crown 8vo., 1741, like the similar work of Niceron,\r\n     is perhaps a little too indiscriminate in the choice of its\r\n     objects: good, bad, and indifferent authors being enlisted\r\n     into the service. But it is the chéf-d'oeuvre of Goujet,\r\n     who was a man of wonderful parts; and no bibliographer can\r\n     be satisfied without it. Goujet was perhaps among the most\r\n     learned, if not the \"facile princeps,\" of those who\r\n     cultivated ancient French literature. He liberally assisted\r\n     Niceron in his Memoires, and furnished Moreri with 2000\r\n     corrections for his Dictionary.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 141: The \"_Bibliothèque Curieuse, Historique et\r\n     Critique, ou Catalogue raisonné de Livres difficiles à\r\n     trouver_,\" of DAVID CLEMENT, published at Gottingen,\r\n     Hanover, and Leipsic, in 9 quarto volumes, from the year\r\n     1750 to 1760--is, unfortunately, an unfinished production;\r\n     extending only to the letter H. The reader may find a\r\n     critique upon it in my _Introduction to the Greek and Latin\r\n     Classics_, vol. i., p. 370; which agrees, for the greater\r\n     part, with the observations in the _Bibl. Crevenn._, vol.\r\n     v., 290. The work is a _sine quâ non_ with collectors; but\r\n     in this country it begins to be--to use the figurative\r\n     language of some of the German bibliographers--\"scarcer than\r\n     a white crow,\"--or \"a black swan.\" The reader may admit\r\n     which simile he pleases--or reject both! But, in sober\r\n     sadness, it is very rare, and unconscionably dear. I know\r\n     not whether it was the same CLEMENT who published \"_Les cinq\r\n     Années Littéraires, ou Lettres de M. Clément, sur les\r\n     ouvrages de Littérature, qui ont parus dans les Années\r\n     1748--á 1752_;\" Berlin, 1756, 12mo., two volumes. Where is\r\n     the proof of the assertion, so often repeated, that Clement\r\n     borrowed his notion of the above work from WENDLER'S\r\n     _Dissertatio de variis raritatis librorum impressorum\r\n     causis_, Jen., 1711, 4to.?--Wendler's book is rare among us:\r\n     as is also BERGER'S _Diatribe de libris rarioribus, &c._,\r\n     Berol. 1729, 8vo.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 142: The principal biographical labours of this\r\n     clever man have the following titles: \"_Histoire de\r\n     l'Imprimerie_,\" La Haye, 1740, 4to.--an elegant and\r\n     interesting volume, which is frequently consulted by\r\n     typographical antiquaries. Of MERCIER'S supplement to it,\r\n     see note in the ensuing pages under the word \"Mercier.\" His\r\n     \"_Dictionnaire Historique, ou Memoires Critiques et\r\n     Littéraires_,\" in two folio volumes, 1758, was a posthumous\r\n     production; and a very extraordinary and amusing\r\n     bibliographical common-place book it is! My friend Mr.\r\n     Douce, than whom few are better able to appreciate such a\r\n     work, will hardly allow any one to have a warmer attachment\r\n     to it, or a more thorough acquaintance with its contents,\r\n     than himself--and yet there is no bibliographical work to\r\n     which I more cheerfully or frequently turn! In the editor's\r\n     advertisement we have an interesting account of Marchand:\r\n     who left behind, for publication, a number of scraps of\r\n     paper, sometimes no bigger than one's nail; upon which he\r\n     had written his remarks in so small a hand-writing that the\r\n     editor and printer were obliged to make use of a strong\r\n     magnifying glass to decypher it--\"et c'est ici (continues\r\n     the former) sans doute le premier livre qui n'ait pu être\r\n     imprimé sans le secours continuel du Microscope.\" Marchand\r\n     died in 1753, and left his MSS. and books, in the true\r\n     spirit of a bibliomaniac, to the University of Leyden. I\r\n     see, from the conclusion of this latter authority, that a\r\n     new edition of Marchand's History of Printing was in\r\n     meditation to be published, after the publication of the\r\n     Dictionary. Whether Mercier availed himself of Marchand's\r\n     corrected copy, when he put forth his supplement to the\r\n     latter's typographical history, I have no means of\r\n     ascertaining. Certainly there never was a second edition of\r\n     the _Histoire de l'Imprimerie_, by Marchsnd [Transcriber's\r\n     Note: Marchand].]\r\n\r\nPerhaps I ought to have noticed the unoccupied niche under which the\r\nname of VOGT[143] is inscribed; the title of whose work has been\r\nerroneously considered more seductive than the contents of it. As we\r\ngo on, we approach FOURNIER; a man of lively parts, and considerable\r\ntaste. His works are small in size, but they are written and printed\r\nwith singular elegance.[144] See what a respectable and almost\r\ndignified air the highly finished bust of the pensionary MEERMAN[145]\r\nassumes! Few men attained to greater celebrity in his day; and few\r\nmen better deserved the handsome things which were said of him.\r\nPolite, hospitable, of an inquisitive and active turn of\r\nmind--passionately addicted to rare and curious books--his library was\r\na sort of bibliographical emporium, where the idle and the diligent\r\nalike met with a gracious reception. Peace to the manes of such a man!\r\nTurn we now round to view the features of that truly eminent and\r\namiable bibliographer, DE BURE!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 143: The earliest edition of VOGT'S _Catalogus\r\n     Librorum Rariorum_ was published in 1732; afterwards in\r\n     1737; again in 1748; again in 1752, much enlarged and\r\n     improved; and, for the last time, greatly enlarged and\r\n     corrected, forming by far the \"editio optima,\" of the\r\n     work--at Frankfort and Leipsic, 1793, 8vo.--We are told, in\r\n     the new preface to this last edition, that the second and\r\n     third impressions were quickly dispersed and anxiously\r\n     sought after. Vogt is a greater favourite with me than with\r\n     the generality of bibliographers. His plan, and the\r\n     execution of it, are at once clear and concise; but he is\r\n     too prodigal of the term \"rare.\" Whilst these editions of\r\n     Vogt's amusing work were coming forth, the following\r\n     productions were, from time to time, making their\r\n     appearance, and endeavouring perhaps to supplant its\r\n     reputation. First of all BEYER put forth his _Memoriæ\r\n     Historico-Criticæ Librorum Rariorum_. Dresd. and Lips.,\r\n     1734, 8vo.; as well has [Transcriber's Note: as] his _Arcana\r\n     Sacra Bibliothecarum Dresdensium_, 1738, 8vo.--with a\r\n     continuation to the latter, preceded by an epistle\r\n     concerning the electoral library, separately published in\r\n     the same year. Then ENGEL (in Republicâ Helveto-Bernensi\r\n     Bibliothecarius primus) published his _Bibliotheca\r\n     selectissima, sive Catalogus librorum in omni genere\r\n     scientiarum rarissimorum_, &c., Bernæ, 1743, 8vo.; in which\r\n     work some axioms are laid down concerning the rarity of\r\n     books not perhaps sufficiently correct; but in which a great\r\n     deal of curious matter, very neatly executed, will repay the\r\n     reader for any expense he may incur in the purchase of it.\r\n     Afterwards FREYTAG'S _Analecta Literaria de libris\r\n     rarioribus_, Lips., 1750, two vols. 8vo.;--and his\r\n     _Adparatus Literarius ubi libri partim antiqui partim rari\r\n     recensentur_, Lipsiæ, 1755, three volumes 8vo., highly\r\n     gratified the curious in bibliography. In the former work\r\n     the books are described alphabetically, which perhaps is the\r\n     better plan: in the latter, they are differently arranged,\r\n     with an alphabetical index. The latter is perhaps the more\r\n     valuable of the two, although the former has long been a\r\n     great favourite with many; yet, from Freytag's own\r\n     confession, he was not then so knowing in books, and had not\r\n     inspected the whole of what he described. They are both\r\n     requisite to the collector; and their author, who was an\r\n     enthusiast in bibliography, ranks high in the literature of\r\n     his country. In the last place we may notice the\r\n     _Florilegium Historico-Criticum Librorum Rariorum, cui multa\r\n     simul scitu jucunda intersperguntur_, &c., of DANIEL GERDES;\r\n     first published at Groningen, in 1740; but afterwards in\r\n     1763, 8vo., at the same place, the third and best edition.\r\n     It was meant, in part, to supply the omission of some rare\r\n     books in Vogt: and under this title it was published in the\r\n     _Miscellaneæ Groninganæ_, vol. ii., and vol. iii. This work\r\n     of Gerdes should have a convenient place in every\r\n     bibliographical cabinet. I will close this attempt to supply\r\n     Lysander's omission of some very respectable names connected\r\n     with bibliography by exhorting the reader to seize hold of a\r\n     work (whenever it comes across him, which will be rarely)\r\n     entitled _Bibliotheca Librorum Rariorum Universalis_, by\r\n     JOHN JACOB BAUER, a bookseller at Nuremberg, and printed\r\n     there in 1770, 8vo., two vols.; with three additional\r\n     volumes by way of Supplement, 1774-1791, which latter are\r\n     usually bound in one. It is an alphabetical Dictionary, like\r\n     Vogt's and Fournier's, of what are called rare books. The\r\n     descriptions are compendious, and the references\r\n     respectable, and sometimes numerous. My copy of this scarce,\r\n     dear, and wretchedly-printed, work, which is as large and\r\n     clean as possible, and bound in pale Russia, with marbled\r\n     edges to the leaves--cost me 5_l._ 5_s._]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 144: We are indebted to PIERRE SIMON FOURNIER le\r\n     jeune, for some very beautiful interesting little volumes\r\n     connected with engraving and printing. 1. _Dissertation sur\r\n     l'Origine et les Progrés de l'art de Graver en Bois, &c._,\r\n     Paris, 1758, 8vo. 2. _De l'Origine et des Productions de\r\n     l'Imprimerie primitive en taille de bois_, Paris, 1759, 8vo.\r\n     3. _Traité sur l'Origine et les Progrés de l'Imprimerie_,\r\n     Paris, 1764. 4. _Observations sur un Ouvrage intitulé\r\n     Vindiciæ Typographicæ_, Paris, 1760.

The\r\n     reader is referred to a note in the first volume of my new\r\n     edition of the _Typographical Antiquities of Great Britain_,\r\n     p. xxxi. It is somewhat singular that, notwithstanding\r\n     Meerman's hypothesis is now exploded by the most knowing\r\n     bibliographers, his dissertation concerning the claims of\r\n     Haerlem should have been reprinted in French, with useful\r\n     notes, and an increased catalogue of all the books published\r\n     in the Low Countries, during the 15th century.

But only look upon the\r\nbust of DE BURE; and every time that you open his _Bibliographie\r\nInstructive_,[147] confess, with a joyful heart, the obligations you\r\nare under to the author of it. Learn, at the same time, to despise the\r\npetty cavils of the whole Zoilean race; and blush for the Abbé\r\nRIVE,[148] that he could lend his name, and give the weight of his\r\nexample, to the propagation of coarse and acrimonious censures.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 147: The works of GUILLAUME-FRANÇOIS DE BURE\r\n     deserve a particular notice. He first published his _Musæum\r\n     Typographicum_, Paris, 1755, 12mo.; of which he printed but\r\n     TWELVE copies, and gave away every one of them (including\r\n     even his own) to his book-loving friends. It was published\r\n     under the name of G.F. Rebude. Peignot is very particular in\r\n     his information concerning this rare morçeau of\r\n     bibliography--see his _Bibliographie Curieuse_, p. 21.\r\n     Afterwards appeared the _Bibliographie Instructive_, in\r\n     seven volumes, 8vo., 1763-68--succeeded by a small volume of\r\n     a catalogue of the anonymous publications, and an essay upon\r\n     Bibliography: this 8th volume is absolutely necessary to\r\n     render the work complete, although it is frequently missing.\r\n     Fifty copies of this work were printed upon LARGE PAPER, of\r\n     a quarto size. Its merits are acknowledged by every candid\r\n     and experienced critic. In the third place, came forth his\r\n     _Catalogue des Livres, &c., de L.J. Gaignat, Paris_, 1769,\r\n     8vo., two vols.: not, however, before he had published two\r\n     brochures--\"_Appel aux Savans_,\" _&c._, 1763, 8vo.--and\r\n     \"_Reponse à une Critique de la Bibliographie Instructive_,\"\r\n     1763, 8vo.--as replies to the tart attacks of the Abbé RIVE.\r\n     The Catalogue of Gaignat, and the fairness of his answers to\r\n     his adversary's censures, served to place De Bure on the\r\n     pinnacle of bibliographical reputation; while Rive was\r\n     suffered to fret and fume in unregarded seclusion. He died\r\n     in the year 1782, aged 50: and was succeeded in his\r\n     bibliographical labours by his cousin WILLIAM; who, with\r\n     Mons. Van-Praet, prepared the catalogue of the Duke de la\r\n     Valliere's library, in 1783, and published other valuable\r\n     catalogues as late as the year 1801. But both are eclipsed,\r\n     in regard to the _number_ of such publications, by their\r\n     predecessor GABRIEL MARTIN; who died in the year 1761, aged\r\n     83--after having compiled 148 catalogues since the year\r\n     1705. This latter was assisted in his labours by his son\r\n     Claude Martin, who died in 1788. See Peignot's _Dict. de\r\n     Bibliologie_, vol. i., 221, 422: vol iii., 277.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 148: The mention of De Bure and the Abbé RIVE\r\n     induces me to inform the reader that the _Chasse aux\r\n     Bibliographes_, Paris, 1789, 8vo., of the latter, will be\r\n     found a receptacle of almost every kind of gross abuse and\r\n     awkward wit which could be poured forth against the\r\n     respectable characters of the day. It has now become rare.\r\n     The Abbé's \"_Notices calligraphiques et typographiques_,\" a\r\n     small tract of 16 pages--of which only 100 copies were\r\n     printed--is sufficiently curious; it formed the first number\r\n     of a series of intended volumes (12 or 15) \"_des notices\r\n     calligraphiques de manuscrits des differens siécles, et des\r\n     notices typographiques de livres du quinziéme siécle_,\" but\r\n     the design was never carried into execution beyond this\r\n     first number. The other works of Rive are miscellaneous; but\r\n     chiefly upon subjects connected with the belles lettres. He\r\n     generally struck off but few copies of his publications; see\r\n     the _Bibliographie Curieuse_, pp. 58-9; and more\r\n     particularly the _Dictionnaire de Bibliologie_, vol. iii.,\r\n     p. 277, by the same author, where a minute list of Rive's\r\n     productions is given, and of which Fournier might have\r\n     availed himself in his new edition of the _Dict. Portatif de\r\n     Bibliographie_. From Peignot, the reader is presented with\r\n     the following anecdotes of this redoubted champion of\r\n     bibliography. When Rive was a young man, and curate of\r\n     Mollèges in Provence, the scandalous chronicle reported that\r\n     he was too intimate with a young and pretty Parisian, who\r\n     was a married woman, and whose husband did not fail to\r\n     reproach him accordingly. Rive made no other reply than that\r\n     of taking the suspicious Benedick in his arms, and throwing\r\n     him headlong out of the window. Luckily he fell upon a\r\n     dunghill! In the year 1789, upon a clergyman's complaining\r\n     to him of the inflexible determination of a great lord to\r\n     hunt upon his grounds--\"_Mettez-lui une messe dans le\r\n     ventre_\"--repiled [Transcriber's Note: replied] Rive. The\r\n     clergyman expressing his ignorance of the nature of the\r\n     advice given, the facetious Abbé replied, \"Go and tear a\r\n     leaf from your _mass book_, wrap a musket-ball in it, and\r\n     discharge it at the tyrant.\" The Duke de la Valliere used to\r\n     say--when the knowing ones at his house were wrangling about\r\n     some literary or bibliographical point--\"Gentlemen, I'll go\r\n     and let loose my bull dog,\"--and sent into them the Abbé,\r\n     who speedily put them all to rights. Rive died in the year\r\n     1791, aged seventy-one. He had great parts and great\r\n     application; but in misapplying both he was his own\r\n     tormentor. His library was sold in 1793.]\r\n\r\nNext to the bust of De Bure, consider those of the five Italian\r\nbibliographers and literati, HAYM, FONTANINI, ZENO, MAZZUCHELLI, and\r\nTIRABOSCHI; which are placed in the five consecutive niches. Their\r\nworks are of various merit, but are all superior to that of their\r\npredecessor DONI. Although those of the first three authors should\r\nfind a place in every bibliographical collection, the productions of\r\nMazzuchelli,[149] and especially of the immortal Tiraboschi, cannot\r\nfail to be admitted into every judicious library, whether vast or\r\nconfined. Italy boasts of few literary characters of a higher class,\r\nor of a more widely-diffused reputation than TIRABOSCHI.[150] His\r\ndiligence, his sagacity, his candour, his constant and patriotic\r\nexertions to do justice to the reputation of his countrymen, and to\r\nrescue departed worth from ill-merited oblivion, assign to him an\r\nexalted situation: a situation with the Poggios and Politians of\r\nformer times, in the everlasting temple of Fame! Bind his _Storia\r\ndella Letteratura Italiana_ in the choicest vellum, or in the stoutest\r\nRussia; for it merits no mean covering!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 149: We may first observe that \"_La Libraria del_\r\n     DONI _Fiorentino_;\" Vinegia, 1558, 8vo., is yet coveted by\r\n     collectors as the most complete and esteemed of all the\r\n     editions of this work. It is ornamented with many portraits\r\n     of authors, and is now rare. Consult _Bibl. Crevenn._, vol.\r\n     v., p. 275. Numerous are the editions of HAYM'S _Biblioteca\r\n     Italiana_; but those of Milan, of the date of 1771, 4to., 2\r\n     vols., and 1803, 8vo. 4 vols., are generally purchased by\r\n     the skilful in Italian bibliography. The best edition of\r\n     FONTANINI'S _Biblioteca dell' Eloquenza Italiana_ is with\r\n     the annotations of ZENO, which latter are distinguished for\r\n     their judgment and accuracy. It was published at Venice in\r\n     1753, 4to., 2 vols.; but it must be remembered that this\r\n     edition contains only the _third_ book of Fontanini, which\r\n     is a library of the principal Italian authors. All the three\r\n     books (the first two being a disquisition upon the orgin\r\n     [Transcriber's Note: origin] and progress of the Italian\r\n     language) will be found in the preceeding [Transcriber's\r\n     Note: preceding] Venice edition of 1737, in one volume 4to.\r\n     In the year 1753-63, came forth the incomparable but\r\n     unfinished work of COUNT MAZZUCHELLI, in two folio volumes,\r\n     [the latter vol. being divided into four thick parts]\r\n     entittled [Transcriber's Note: entitled]: _Gli Scrittori\r\n     d'Italia, cioé Notizie Storiche e Critiche intorno alle Vite\r\n     e agli Scritti dei Letterati Italiani_. The death of the\r\n     learned author prevented the publication of it beyond the\r\n     first two letters of the alphabet. The Count, however, left\r\n     behind ample materials for its execution according to the\r\n     original plan, which lay shamefully neglected as late as the\r\n     year 1776. See _Bibl. Crevenn._, vol. v., p. 274. This work\r\n     is rare in our own country. If the lover of Italian\r\n     philology wishes to increase his critico-literary stores,\r\n     let him purchase the _Biblioteca degli Autori Antichi Greci,\r\n     e Latini volgarizzati_, &c., of PAITONI, in five quarto\r\n     volumes, 1766: the _Notizie Istorico-Critiche &c., degli\r\n     Scrittori Viniziani_, [Transcriber's Note: corrected printer\r\n     error in original; 'degli' was misplaced on preceding line]\r\n     of AGOSTINI, Venez., 1752, 4to., 2 vols.: and the\r\n     _Letteratura Turchesca of_ GIAMBATISTA TODERINI, Venez.,\r\n     1787, 8vo., 3 vols.--works nearly perfect of their kind, and\r\n     (especially the latter one) full of curious matter.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 150: The best edition of his _Letteratura\r\n     Italiana_ is that of Modena, 1787-94, 4to., in fifteen\r\n     volumes, as it contains his last corrections and additions,\r\n     and has the advantage of a complete index. An excellent\r\n     account of the life and labours of its wonderful author\r\n     appeared in the fifth volume of the _Athenæum_, to the\r\n     perusal of which I strongly recommend the reader.]\r\n\r\nThe range of busts which occupies the opposite niches represents\r\ncharacters of a more recent date. Let us begin with MERCIER;[151] a\r\nman of extraordinary, and almost unequalled, knowledge in every thing\r\nconnected with bibliography and typography; of a quick apprehension,\r\ntenacious memory, and correct judgment; who was more anxious to\r\ndetect errors in his own publications than in those of his fellow\r\nlabourers in the same pursuit; an enthusiast in typographical\r\nresearches--the Ulysses of bibliographers! Next to him stand the\r\ninteresting busts of SAXIUS and LAIRE;[152] the latter of whom has\r\nfrequently erred, but who merited not such a castigation as subsequent\r\nbibliographers have attempted to bestow upon him: in the number of\r\nwhich, one is sorry to rank the very respectable name of\r\nAUDIFFREDI[153]--whose bust, you observe, immediately follows that of\r\nLaire. Audiffredi has left behind him a most enviable reputation: that\r\nof having examined libraries with a curious eye, and described the\r\nvarious books which he saw with scrupulous fidelity. There are no\r\nlively or interesting sallies, no highly-wrought, or tempting\r\ndescriptions--throughout his two quarto volumes: but, in lieu of this,\r\nthere is sober truth, and sound judgment. I have mentioned Audiffredi\r\na little out of order, merely because his name is closely connected\r\nwith that of Laire: but I should have first directed your attention to\r\nthe sagacious countenance of HEINECKEN;[154] whose work upon ancient\r\nprinting, and whose _Dictionary of Engravers_ (although with the\r\nlatter we have nothing just now to do) will never fail to be justly\r\nappreciated by the collector. I regret, Lisardo, for your own sake--as\r\nyou are about to collect a few choice books upon typography--that you\r\nwill have so much to pay for the former work, owing to its extreme\r\nrarity in this country, and to the injudicious phrenzy of a certain\r\nclass of buyers, who are resolved to purchase it at almost any price.\r\nLet me not forget to notice, with the encomiums which they deserve,\r\nthe useful and carefully compiled works of SEEMILLER, BRAUN,\r\nWURDTWEIN, DE MURR, ROSSI, and PANZER, whose busts are arranged in\r\nprogressive order. All these authors[155] are greatly eminent in the\r\nseveral departments which they occupy; especially Panzer--whose\r\n_Annales Typographici_, in regard to arrangement and fulness of\r\ninformation, leaves the similar work of his precedessor, Maittaire,\r\nfar behind. It is unluckily printed upon wretched paper--but who\r\nrejects the pine-apple from the roughness of its coat? Get ready the\r\nwherry; man it with a choice bibliomanical crew, good Lisardo!--and\r\nsmuggle over in it, if you can, the precious works of these latter\r\nbibliographers--for you may saunter \"from rise to set of sun,\" from\r\nWhitechapel to Hyde-Park Corner--for them--in vain!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 151: Barthelemy, MERCIER DE ST. LEGER, died in the\r\n     year 1800, and in the sixty-sixth of his age, full of\r\n     reputation, and deeply regretted by those who knew the\r\n     delightful qualities of his head and heart. It is not my\r\n     intention to enumerate _all_ his publications, the titles of\r\n     which may be found in the _Siécles Littéraires_, vol. iv.,\r\n     p. 350: but, in the present place, I will only observe that\r\n     his \"_Supplement à l'Histoire de l'Imprimerie, par P.\r\n     Marchand_,\" was first published in 1773, and afterwards in\r\n     1775, 4to., a rare and curious work; but little known in\r\n     this country. His _Bibliothéque des Romans, traduit de\r\n     Grec_, was published in 1796, 12 vols. 12mo. His letter\r\n     concerning De Bure's work, 1763, 8vo., betrayed some severe\r\n     animadversions upon the _Bibliogr. Instruct._: but he got a\r\n     similar flagellation in return, from the Abbé Rive, in his\r\n     _Chasse aux Bibliographes_--who held him and De Bure, and\r\n     all the bibliographical tribe, in sovereign contempt. His\r\n     letter to Heinecken upon the rare editions of the 15th\r\n     century, 1783, 8vo., and his other works, I never saw in any\r\n     collection. The imperial library at Paris purchased his copy\r\n     of Du Verdier's and La Croix du Maine's Bibliothéques,\r\n     covered with his marginal annotations, as well as his copy\r\n     of Clement's _Bibl. Curieuse_. Le Blond, member of the\r\n     Institute, obtained his copy of De Bure's _Bibliographie\r\n     Instructive_, also enriched with MS. notes. Mr. Ochéda, Lord\r\n     Spencer's librarian, who knew well the Abbé de St. Leger,\r\n     informed me that he left behind him ample materials for a\r\n     History of Printing, in a new edition of his Supplement to\r\n     Marchand's work, which he projected publishing, and which\r\n     had received from him innumerable additions and corrections.\r\n     \"He was a man,\" says Mr. Ochéda, \"the most conversant with\r\n     editions of books of all kinds, and with every thing\r\n     connected with typography and bibliography, that I ever\r\n     conversed with.\" The reader may consult Peignot's _Dict. de\r\n     Bibliologie_, vol. i., p. 452, vol. iii., p. 212.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 152: The _Onomasticon Literarium_ of CHRISTOPHER\r\n     SAXIUS, _Traject. ad Rhenum_, 1775-90, seven vols. 8vo.,\r\n     with a supplement, or eighth volume, published in 1803, is\r\n     considered as a work of the very first reputation in its\r\n     way. The notices of eminent men are compendious, but\r\n     accurate; and the arrangement is at once lucid and new. An\r\n     elegantly bound copy of this scarce work cannot be obtained\r\n     for less than six and seven guineas. The first\r\n     bibliographical production of the Abbé LAIRE was, I believe,\r\n     the _Specimen Historicum Typographiæ Romanæ, xv. seculi,\r\n     Romæ_, 1778, large 8vo.; of which work, a copy printed UPON\r\n     VELLUM (perhaps unique) was sold at the sale of M.\r\n     d'Hangard, in 1789, for 300 livres. _Dictionn. Bibliogr._,\r\n     vol. iv., p. 250. In my Introduction, &c., to the Greek and\r\n     Latin Classics, some account of its intrinsic merit will be\r\n     found: vol. i., p. xviii. In the year 1784 Laire published a\r\n     \"_Dissertation sur l'origine et Progrès de l'Imprimerie en\r\n     Franche-Comté_,\" 8vo.; and, in the year 1791, came forth his\r\n     Catalogue Raisonné of the early printed books in the library\r\n     of Cardinal de Lomenie de Brienne; under the title of\r\n     \"_Index Librorum ab Inventa Typographia, ad annum 1500_,\" in\r\n     two octavo volumes. See the article \"LOMENIE,\" in the list\r\n     of foreign catalogues, post. Laire was also the author of a\r\n     few other minor bibliographical productions. All the books\r\n     in his library, relating to this subject, were covered with\r\n     marginal notes; some of them very curious. See Peignot's\r\n     _Dict. de Bibliologie_, vol. i., p. 330: and _Les Siecles\r\n     Littéraires_, (1801, 8vo.) vol. iv., p. 75.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 153: The works and the merits of AUDIFFREDI have\r\n     been before submitted by me to the public; and Mr. Beloe, in\r\n     the third volume of his \"_Anecdotes of Literature_,\" &c.,\r\n     has justly observed upon the latter. In Lord Spencer's\r\n     magnificent library at Althorpe, I saw a copy of the\r\n     \"_Editiones Italicæ_,\" sec. xv., 1793, 4to., upon LARGE\r\n     PAPER. It is much to be wished that some knowing\r\n     bibliographer upon the Continent would complete this\r\n     unfinished work of Audiffredi. His _Editiones Romanæ_, sec.\r\n     xv., 1783, 4to., is one of the most perfect works of\r\n     bibliography extant: yet Laire's \"_Index Librorum_,\" &c.\r\n     (see preceeding note), is necessary to supply the omission\r\n     of some early books printed at Rome, which had escaped even\r\n     this keen bibliographer!]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 154: HEINECKEN'S name stands deservedly high\r\n     (notwithstanding his tediousness and want of taste) among\r\n     bibliographical and typographical antiquaries.

It was again published in\r\n     1786. His \"_Idée Générale d'une Collection complette\r\n     d'Estampes_,\" &c., Leips., 1771, 8vo., is a most curious and\r\n     entertaining book; but unconscionably dear in this country.\r\n     His \"_Dictionnaire des Artistes dont nous avons des\r\n     Estampes_,\" &c., Leips. 1778, 8vo., four vols., is an\r\n     unfinished performance, but remarkably minute as far as it\r\n     goes. The remainder, written in the German language,\r\n     continues in MS. in the Electorate library at Dresden,\r\n     forming twelve volumes. Of the character of Heinecken's\r\n     latter work, consult Huber's _Manuel, &c., des Amateurs de\r\n     l'Art_, Zurich, 1797, 8vo.: and a recent work entitled\r\n     \"_Notices des Graveurs_,\" Paris, 1804, 8vo., two vols.\r\n     Heinecken died at the advanced age of eighty.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 155: We will discuss their works _seriatim_, as\r\n     Lisardo has said above. SEEMILLER'S _Bibliothecæ\r\n     Incolstadiensis Incunabula Typographica_, contains four\r\n     parts, or fasciculi: they are bound in one volume, quarto,\r\n     1787, &c.; but, unfortunately for those who love curious and\r\n     carefully executed works, it is rather rare in this country.\r\n     The _Notitia Historico-Critica de libris ab art typog.\r\n     invent._, by PLACID BRAUN, in two parts, or volumes, 1788,\r\n     4to., with curious plates, has long been a desideratum in my\r\n     own collection; and my friend Mr. Beloe, who is luckily in\r\n     possession of a copy, enjoys his triumph over me when he\r\n     discovers it not in my bibliographical boudoir.

DE MURR published a work\r\n     of some interest, entitled, \"_Memorabilia Bibliothecarum\r\n     Publicarum Norimbergensium_,\" Norimb., 1786-91, three parts\r\n     or vols. 8vo.; which is also rare.----ROSSI'S valuable work\r\n     concerning the annals of Hebrew typography: _Annales\r\n     Hebræo-Typographici, à 1475, ad 1540_, Parmæ, 1795, 1799,\r\n     4to., two separate publications, is prettily printed by\r\n     Bodoni, and is an indispensable article in the collection of\r\n     the typographical antiquary. See the _Dict. de Bibliologie_,\r\n     vol. iii., p. 286.----PANZER'S _Annales Typographici_, in\r\n     eleven quarto volumes (1793-1803) is a work of the very\r\n     first importance to bibliographers. Its arrangement, after\r\n     the manner of Orlandi's, is clear and most convenient; and\r\n     the references to authorities, which are innumerable, are,\r\n     upon the whole, very faithful. The indexes are copious and\r\n     satisfactory. This work (of which I hear there are only\r\n     three copies upon LARGE PAPER) contains an account of books\r\n     which were printed in all parts of Europe from the year\r\n     1457, to 1536, inclusive; but it should be remembered that\r\n     the author published a distinct work in the year 1788, 4to.,\r\n     relating to books which were printed, within the same\r\n     period, in the _German Language_; and this should always\r\n     accompany the eleven Latin volumes. I will just add from it,\r\n     as a curiosity, the title and colophon (translated into\r\n     English) of the first printed book in the German\r\n     language:--\"THE PUBLICATION OF DIETHERS, ELECTOR OF MAYENCE,\r\n     AGAINST COUNT ADOLPHUS OF NASSAU; _given out under our\r\n     impressed seal on Tuesday, after the fourth Sunday in\r\n     Advent, anno Domini 1462_.\" Consult also Wurdtwein's _Bibl.\r\n     Mogunt._, p. 80; and the authorities there referred to. It\r\n     seems doubtful whether this curious little brochure, of\r\n     which scarcely any thing more than a fragment now remains,\r\n     was printed by Fust and Schoeffer, or by Gutenberg.]\r\n\r\nWhat countenances are those which beam with so much quiet, but\r\ninteresting, expression? They are the resemblances of DENIS and\r\nCAMUS:[156] the former of whom is better known from his _Annalium\r\nTypographicorum Maittaire Supplementum_; and the latter very generally\r\nrespected abroad, although our acquaintance with him in this country\r\nis exceedingly slight. If I mistake not, I observe the mild and modest\r\ncountenance of my old acquaintance, HERBERT, in this bibliographical\r\ngroup of heads? Do not despise his toil[157] because it is not\r\nsprinkled with gay conceits, or learned digressions: he wrote to be\r\nuseful, not to be entertaining; and so far as he went, his work was\r\nsuch an improvement upon his predecessor's plan as to place it quite\r\nat the head of NATIONAL TYPOGRAPHY. See yonder the sensible\r\ncountenance of HARWOOD![158] the first writer in this country who\r\ntaught us to consider the respective merits and demerits of the\r\nvarious editions of Greek and Latin authors.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 156: MICHAEL DENIS, the translator of Ossian, and\r\n     a bibliographer of justly established eminence, was\r\n     principal librarian of the Imperial library at Vienna, and\r\n     died in the year 1800, at the age of 71. His _Supplement to\r\n     Maittaire's Typographical Annals_, in two parts or volumes,\r\n     1789, 4to., is a work of solid merit, and indispensable to\r\n     the possessor of its precursor. The bibliographical\r\n     references are very few; but the descriptions of the volumes\r\n     are minutely accurate. The indexes also are excellent. In\r\n     the year 1793, Denis published the first volume (in three\r\n     thick parts in folio) of his _Codices Manuscripti Theologici\r\n     Bibl. Palat. Vindob._; a production which the reader will\r\n     find somewhat fully described in the ensuing pages. The\r\n     second volume appeared after his death in 1801. In 1795-6,\r\n     came forth his second edition of an _Introduction to the\r\n     Knowledge of Books_, in two quarto volumes; unfortunately\r\n     written in the German language--but mentioned with\r\n     approbation in the first volume of the _Mem. de l'Inst._, p.\r\n     648. Consult also Peignot's _Dict. de Bibliologie_, vol. i.,\r\n     p. 122; ii., 232.----ARMAND GASTON CAMUS is a bibliographer\r\n     of very first rate reputation. The reader has only to peruse\r\n     the following titles of some of his works, and he will\r\n     certainly bewail his ill fortune if they are not to be found\r\n     in his library. 1. _Observations sur la distribution et le\r\n     classement des livres d'une Bibliothéque_: 2. _Additions aux\r\n     mêmes_; 3. _Memoire sur un livre Allemand_ (which is the\r\n     famous TEWRDANNCKHS; and about which is to be hoped that Mr.\r\n     Douce will one day favour us with his curious remarks): 4.\r\n     _Addition au même_: 5. _Memoire sur l'histoire et les\r\n     procédés du Polytypage et de la Stéréotypie_: 6. _Rapport\r\n     sur la continuation de la Collection des Historiens de\r\n     France, et de celle des Chartres et Diplomes_: 7. _Notice\r\n     d'un livre imprimé à Bamberg en 1462_. All these works are\r\n     thus strung together, because they occur in the first three\r\n     volumes of the _Memoires de l'Institut_. This curious book,\r\n     printed at Bamberg, was discovered by a German clergyman of\r\n     the name of Stenier, and was first described by him in the\r\n     _Magasin Hist.-Litt., bibliogr._ Chemintz, 1792: but Camus's\r\n     memoir is replete with curious matter, and is illustrated\r\n     with fac-simile cuts. In the \"_Notices et Extraits des MSS.\r\n     de la Bibl. Nationale_,\" vol. vi., p. 106, will be found a\r\n     most interesting memoir by him, relating to two ancient\r\n     manuscript bibles, in two volumes folio, adorned with a\r\n     profusion of pictures: of some of which very elegant\r\n     fac-similes are given. These pictures are 5152 in number!\r\n     each of them having a Latin and French verse beautifully\r\n     written and illuminated beneath.--Camus supposes that such a\r\n     work could not now be executed under 100,000 francs!--\"Where\r\n     (exclaims he) shall we find such modern specimens of\r\n     book-luxury?\" In the year 1802, he published an admirable\r\n     \"_Mémoire sur la collection des grands et petits voyages, et\r\n     sur la Collection des Voyages des Melchesedech Thevenot_,\"\r\n     4to., with an excellent \"Table des Matières.\" Of his own\r\n     journey into the Low Countries, recently published, I never\r\n     met with a copy. All the preceding works, with the exception\r\n     of the last, are in my own humble collection.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 157: A short bibliographical memoir of HERBERT\r\n     will be found in the first volume of my edition of the\r\n     _Typographical Antiquities of Great Britain_. Since that was\r\n     published, I have gleaned a few further particulars relating\r\n     to him, which may be acceptable to the reader. Shortly after\r\n     the appearance of his third volume, he thus speaks in a\r\n     letter to Mr. Price, librarian of the Bodleian library, \"If\r\n     at any time you meet with any book of which I have not taken\r\n     notice, or made any mistake in the description of it, your\r\n     kind information will be esteemed a favour; as I purpose to\r\n     continue collecting materials for a future publication, when\r\n     enough shall be collected to make another volume.\" This was\r\n     in April, 1790. In the ensuing month he thus addresses his\r\n     old friend Mr. White, of Crickhowell, who, with himself, was\r\n     desperately addicted to the black-letter. \"To morrow my wife\r\n     and self set out for Norfolk to take a little relaxation for\r\n     about a fortnight. I hope my labours will in some good\r\n     measure answer the expectation of my friends and subscribers\r\n     in general. Sure I am my best endeavours have been exerted\r\n     for that purpose. I have been 24 years collecting materials;\r\n     have spent many a fair pound, and many a weary hour; and it\r\n     is now ten years since the first part was committed to the\r\n     press. I purpose to continue collecting materials in order\r\n     to a fourth volume, &c.;--yet by no means will I make myself\r\n     debtor to the public when to publish: if it shall please God\r\n     to take me to himself, Isaac will in due time set it forth.\r\n     However I shall keep an interleaved copy for the purpose.\"\r\n     In a letter to a Mr. John Banger Russell (in Dorsetshire),\r\n     written in the ensuing month of June, the same sentiments\r\n     and the same intention are avowed. Thus ardent was the\r\n     bibliomaniacal spirit of Herbert in his 72d year! The\r\n     _interleaved copy_ here alluded to (which was bound in six\r\n     volumes 4to., in Russia binding, and for which Mr. Gough had\r\n     given Herbert's widow 52_l._ 10_s._) is now in my\r\n     possession; as well as the yet more valuable acquisition of\r\n     some numerous MS. addenda to his History of Printing--both\r\n     of these articles having been purchased by me at the sale of\r\n     Mr. Gough's MSS. and printed books, A.D. 1810.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 158: Dr. EDWARD HARWOOD published the fourth and\r\n     last edition of his \"_View of the various editions of the\r\n     Greek and Roman Classics_,\" in the year 1790, 8vo. A work\r\n     which, in the public estimation, has entitled its author's\r\n     memory to very considerable respect in the classical world;\r\n     although the late Professor Porson, in the fly leaf of a\r\n     copy of my second edition of a similar publication, was\r\n     pleased to call the Doctor by a name rather unusually harsh\r\n     with _him_, who was \"Criticus et lenis et acutus;\" censuring\r\n     also my dependance upon my predecessor. In the year 1808,\r\n     was published my third edition of \"_An introduction to the\r\n     knowledge of rare and valuable editions of the Greek and\r\n     Latin Classics_,\" two volumes 8vo.: in which, if I may\r\n     presume to talk of anything so insignificant, I have\r\n     endeavoured to exhibit the opinions--not of Dr. Harwood\r\n     alone, but of the most eminent foreign critics and\r\n     editors--upon the numerous editions which, in a\r\n     chronological series, are brought before the reader's\r\n     attention. The remarks of the first bibliographers in Europe\r\n     are also, for the first time in a English publication,\r\n     subjoined; so that the lover of curious, as well as of\r\n     valuable, editions may be equally gratified. The\r\n     authorities, exceedingly numerous as well as respectable,\r\n     are referred to in a manner the most unostentatious; and a\r\n     full measure of text, and to be really useful, was my design\r\n     from the beginning to the end of it. To write a long and\r\n     dull homily about its imperfections would be gross\r\n     affectation. An extensive sale has satisfied my publishers\r\n     that its merit a little counterbalances its defects.]\r\n\r\nLIS. You are, no doubt, a fond and partial critic in regard to the\r\nworks of Herbert and Harwood: but I am glad to recognise my fellow\r\ncountrymen in such an illustrious assemblage. Go on.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. We are just at the close. But a few more busts, and those very\r\nrecently executed, remain to be noticed. These are the resemblances of\r\nLA SERNA SANTANDER, CAILLEAU, and OBERLIN;[159] while several vacant\r\nniches remain to be filled up with the busts of more modern\r\nbibliographers of eminence: namely, of VAN-PRAET, FISCHER, LAMBINET,\r\nRENOUARD, PEIGNOT, FOURNIER, BARBIER, BOUCHER, and BRUNET.[160]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 159: DE LA SERNA SANTANDER will always hold a\r\n     distinguished place amongst bibliographers, not only from\r\n     the care and attention with which he put forth the catalogue\r\n     of his own books--the parting from which must have gone near\r\n     to break his heart--but from his elegant and useful work\r\n     entitled, \"_Dictionnaire Bibliographique choisi du quinzieme\r\n     Siécle_,\" 1805, &c., 8vo., in three parts or volumes. His\r\n     summary of researches, upon the invention of printing, Mr.\r\n     Edwards told me, he read \"with complete satisfaction\"--this\r\n     occupies the first part or volume. The remaining volumes\r\n     form a necessary, as well as brilliant, supplement to De\r\n     Bure. Just at this moment, I believe that Mr. Beloe's, and\r\n     my own, copy of the work, are the only ones in this\r\n     country.----CAILLEAU has the credit of being author of the\r\n     _Dictionnaire Bibliographique_, &c., in three volumes,\r\n     octavo, 1790--of which there are a sufficient number of\r\n     counterfeited and faulty re-impressions; but which, after\r\n     all, in its original shape, edit. 1790, is not free from\r\n     gross errors; however useful it is in many respects. I\r\n     suspect, however, that the Abbé DUCLOS had the greater share\r\n     in this publication: but, be this as it may, the fourth\r\n     supplemental volume (by the younger Brunet) is, in every\r\n     respect, a more accurate and valuable performance. OBERLIN,\r\n     librarian of the central school or college at Strasbourg, is\r\n     author of a bibliographical treatise particularly deserving\r\n     of the antiquary's attention: namely, _Essai d'annales de la\r\n     vie de Jean Gutenburg [Transcriber's Note: Gutenberg], &c._,\r\n     Stasb. [Transcriber's Note: Strasb.], an. ix., 8vo. His\r\n     other numerous (belles-lettres) works are minutely specified\r\n     by Peignot in his _Dict. de Bibliologie_, vol. iii., p. 230.\r\n     His edition of Horace, Argent., 1788, 4to., is both elegant\r\n     and correct.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 160: Let us go quietly through the modern French\r\n     school of bibliography.----Mons. JOSEPH VAN-PRAET is\r\n     principal librarian of the Imperial collection at Paris, and\r\n     is justly called, by some of his fellow-labourers in the\r\n     same career, \"one of the first bibliographers in Europe.\" He\r\n     is known to me, as a bibliographical writer, only by the\r\n     part which he took, and so ably executed, in the Valliere\r\n     catalogue of 1783. Peignot informs us that M. Van-Praet is\r\n     now busy in composing a little work--which I am sure will\r\n     rejoice the hearts of all true bibliomaniacs to be apprised\r\n     of--called a _Catalogue raisonné_ of books PRINTED UPON\r\n     VELLUM; for which he has already prepared not fewer than\r\n     2000 articles! See the _Curiosités Bibliogr._, p. iij. Among\r\n     these VELLUM articles, gentle reader, I assure thee that\r\n     thine eyes will be blest with the description of \"THE SHYP\r\n     OF FOOLES,\" printed by Pynson, 1509! The urbanity and\r\n     politeness of this distinguished librarian are equal to his\r\n     knowledge.----GOTTHELF FISCHER, a Saxon by birth, and\r\n     librarian of the public collection at Mentz, has given us\r\n     the following interesting treatises, of which, I believe,\r\n     not five copies are to be found in this country:\r\n     namely--_Essai sur les Monumens Typographiques de Jean\r\n     Gutenberg, &c._, an. x. [1801], 4to.: and _Descriptions de\r\n     raretés typographiques et de Manuscrits remarquables, &c._,\r\n     Nuremb., 1801, 8vo.--the latter is in the German language,\r\n     and has cuts--with a portrait of Fust. By this time, the\r\n     work has most probably been translated into French, as it is\r\n     frequently referred to and highly spoken of by foreigners.\r\n     Peignot [_Dict. de Bibliologie_, vol. iii., p. 128] refers\r\n     us to the fine eulogy pronounced upon Fisher [Transcriber's\r\n     Note: Fischer] (not yet 40 years of age) by Camus, in his\r\n     \"Voyage dans les departemens réunis,\" p. 12.----LAMBINET\r\n     will always be remembered and respected, as long as printing\r\n     and bibliography shall be studied, by his \"_Recherches\r\n     Historiques Littéraires et Critiques, sur l'Originè de\r\n     L'Imprimerie; particulièrement sur les premiers\r\n     établissemens au_ XVme _siécle dans la Belgique_,\" &c.,\r\n     Brux., an. vii. (1798), 8vo. It is, indeed, a very\r\n     satisfactory performance: the result of judgment and\r\n     taste--rare union!----In like manner, RENOUARD has procured\r\n     for himself a bibliographical immortality by his _Annales de\r\n     l'Imprimerie des Aide_, 1803, 8vo., two vols.: a work almost\r\n     perfect of its kind, and by many degrees superior to\r\n     Bandini's dry _Annales Typog. Juntarum._, Lucæ, 1761. In\r\n     Renouard's taste, accuracy and interest are delightfully\r\n     combined; and the work is printed with unrivalled beauty.\r\n     There were only six copies of it printed upon LARGE PAPER;\r\n     one of which I saw in the fine collection of the Rt. Hon. T.\r\n     Grenville.----Few modern bibliographers have displayed so\r\n     much diligence as GABRIEL PEIGNOT: from whom we have, 1.\r\n     _Dictionnaire Raisonné de Bibliologie_, Paris, 1802, 8vo.,\r\n     two vols., with a third, by way of supplement (1804). With\r\n     necessary corrections and additions, this work would answer\r\n     many useful purposes in an English translation. 2. _Essai de\r\n     Curiosités Bibliographiques_, 1804, 8vo. This is a very\r\n     amusing (but scarce and unconscionably dear) book. It\r\n     contains elaborate descriptions of many curious and\r\n     sumptuous works, which were sold for 1000 and more livres at\r\n     public sales. 3. _Dictionnaire, &c., des principaux livres\r\n     condamnés au feu, supprimés ou censurés_, Paris, 1806, 8vo.,\r\n     2 vols. The very title of such a work must sharpen the edge\r\n     of curiosity with those bibliomaniacs who have never seen\r\n     it. 4. _Bibliographie Curieuse, ou Notice Raisonnée des\r\n     livres imprimés a cent exemplaires au plus, suivie d'une\r\n     notice de quelques ouvrages tirés sur papier de couleur_,\r\n     Paris, 1808, 8vo. Only one hundred copies of this thin\r\n     volume were struck off: of which I possess the 86th copy,\r\n     according to Peignot's notification. Indeed I am fortunate\r\n     in having all his preceding works. Let us wish long life and\r\n     never-failing success to so brave a book-chevalier as\r\n     Gabriel Peignot.----FRANÇOIS IGNACE FOURNIER, at 18 years of\r\n     age, published an elegantly printed little volume, entitled\r\n     _Essai Portatif de Bibliographie_, 1796, 8vo., of which only\r\n     26 copies were struck off. In the year 1805, this essay\r\n     assumed the form of a Dictionary, and appeared under the\r\n     title of _Dictionnaire portatif de Bibliographie, &c._,\r\n     8vo., comprising 17,000 articles, printed in a very small\r\n     character. Last year, in the month of May, Fournier put\r\n     forth a new edition of this _Dictionnaire_, considerably\r\n     augmented; but in which (such is the fate of bibliographical\r\n     studies) notwithstanding all the care of the author, Brunet\r\n     tells us that he has discovered not fewer than five hundred\r\n     errors! Let not Fournier, however be discouraged; in a few\r\n     years he will achieve something yet more worthy of his\r\n     laudable seal in bibliography.----ANTOINE-ALEXANDRE BARBIER,\r\n     librarian of the Council of State, has favoured us with an\r\n     admirably well executed work, entitled _Dictionnaire des\r\n     Ouvrages Anonymes et Pseudonymes, composés, traduits ou\r\n     publiés en Français, &c., accompagneé de notes historiques\r\n     et critiques_, Paris, _Imprimis Bibliogr._, 1806, 8vo., two\r\n     vols. See also art. \"Conseil d'Etat,\" in the list of French\r\n     Catalogues, post. From these the reader will judge of the\r\n     warm thanks to which this eminent bibliographer is entitled\r\n     for his very useful labours.----G. BOUCHER de la Richarderie\r\n     has, in an especial manner, distinguished himself by his\r\n     _Bibliothéque Universelle des Voyages_, Paris, 1808, 8vo.,\r\n     six vols.: a work executed with care, minuteness, and\r\n     considerable interest. Some of its extracts are, perhaps,\r\n     unnecessarily long. The index to the sixth volume will lead\r\n     the reader to consult an account of some of the most\r\n     ancient, rare, and curious publications of voyages which\r\n     have ever appeared: and Boucher \"has deserved well\" of the\r\n     book world by this truly valuable and almost indispensable\r\n     performance.----BRUNET Le Fils. This able writer, and\r\n     enthusiastic devotee to bibliography, has recently published\r\n     an excellent and copious work which would appear greatly to\r\n     eclipse Fournier's; entitled \"_Manuel du Libraire et de\r\n     l'Amateur de Livres, contenant, 1. Un Nouveau Dictionnaire\r\n     Bibliographigue, 2. Une Table en forme de Catalogue\r\n     Raisonnée_,\" Paris, 1810, 8vo., 3 vols.: in which he tells us\r\n     he has devoted at least thirty years to the examination of\r\n     books. The first two volumes form a scientific arrangement:\r\n     the latter is an alphabetical one, referring to one or the\r\n     other of the preceding volumes for a more copious account of\r\n     the work. It must be confessed that Brunet has, in this\r\n     publication, executed a difficult task with great ability.]\r\n\r\nLIS. I am quite anxious to possess the publications of these moderns:\r\nbut you say nothing of their comparative value with the ancients.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Generally speaking, in regard to discoveries of rare books and\r\ntypographical curiosities, the moderns have the advantage. They have\r\nmade more rational conclusions, from data which had escaped their\r\npredecessors: and the sparkling and animated manner in which they\r\ndress out the particular objects that they describe renders the\r\nperusal of their works more pleasant and gratifying. I am not sure\r\nthat they have the learning of the old school: but their works are, in\r\ngeneral, less ponderous and repulsive. The ancient bibliographers were\r\nprobably too anxious to describe every thing, however minute and\r\nunimportant: they thought it better to say too much than too little;\r\nand, finding the great mass of readers in former times, uninstructed\r\nin these particular pursuits, they thought they could never exhaust a\r\nsubject by bringing to bear upon it every point, however remotely\r\nconnected! They found the plain, it is true, parched and sandy; but\r\nthey were not satisfied with pouring water upon it, 'till they had\r\nconverted it into a deluge.[161]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 161: What Denis says, in the preface to his\r\n     _Catalog. Cod. MSS. Bibl. Palat. Vindob._ (of which see p.\r\n     65, ante) is very just; \"media incedendum via; neque nudis\r\n     codicum titulis, ut quibusdam bibliothecis placuit, in\r\n     chartam conjectis provehi multum studia, neque _doctis, quæ\r\n     superioris seculi fuit intemperantia, ambagibus et\r\n     excursibus_.\"--This is certainly descriptive of the OLD\r\n     SCHOOL of bibliography.]\r\n\r\nLIS. Let me ask you, at this stage of our inquiries, what you mean by\r\nbibliographical publications?--and whether the works of those authors\r\nwhich you have enumerated are sufficient to enable a novice, like\r\nmyself, to have pretty accurate notions about the rarity and intrinsic\r\nvalue of certain works?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. By bibliographical publications, I mean such works as give us\r\nsome knowledge of the literary productions, as well as of the life,\r\nof certain learned men; which state the various and the best editions\r\nof their lucubrations; and which stimulate us to get possession of\r\nthese editions. Every biographical narrative which is enriched with\r\nthe mention of curious and rare editions of certain works is, to a\r\ngreat extent, a bibliographical publication. Those works which treat\r\nprofessedly upon books are, of course, immediately within the pale of\r\nbibliography.\r\n\r\nLIS. But am I to be satisfied with the possession of those works\r\nalready recommended?\r\n\r\nPHIL. I suppose Lisardo has heard of certain valuable CATALOGUES, and\r\nhe wishes to know how far the possession of these may be requisite in\r\norder to make him a bibliographer?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. At present I will say nothing about the catalogues of the\r\ncollections of our own countrymen. As we have been travelling\r\nprincipally abroad, we may direct our attention to those which relate\r\nto foreign collections.\r\n\r\nAnd first, let us pay a due tribute of praise to the published\r\nCatalogues of Libraries collected by the JESUITS: men of shrewd\r\ntalents and unabating research, and in derogation of whose merits\r\nVoltaire and D'Alembert disgraced themselves by scribbling the most\r\ncontemptible lampoons. The downfall of this society led, not very\r\nindirectly, to the destruction of the ancient French monarchy. Men\r\nseemed to forget that while the most shameless depredations were\r\ncommitted within the libraries of the Jesuits, the cause of learning,\r\nas well as of liberty, suffered,--and the spoils which have glittered\r\nbefore our eyes, as the precious relics of these collections, serve to\r\nafford a melancholy proof how little those men stick at any thing who,\r\nin raising the war-whoop of liberty and equality, tear open the very\r\nbowels of order, tranquillity, peace, and decorum! But, to the\r\nsubject. Let the catalogues of PUBLIC COLLECTIONS, when they are well\r\narranged, be received into your library. Of foreign PRIVATE\r\nCOLLECTIONS, the catalogues[162] of DU FRESNE, CORDES, HEINSIAS,\r\nBALUZE, COLBERT, ROTHELIN, DE BOZE, PREFOND, POMPADOUR, GAIGNAT,\r\nGOUTTARD, BUNAU, SOUBISE, LA VALLIERE, CREVENNA, LAMOIGNON, and of\r\nseveral other collections, with which my memory does not just now\r\nserve me, will enable you to form a pretty correct estimate of the\r\n_marketable value_ of certain rare and sumptuous publications.\r\nCatalogues are, to bibliographers, what _Reports_ are to lawyers: not\r\nto be read through from beginning to end--but to be consulted on\r\ndoubtful points, and in litigated cases. Nor must you, after all,\r\nplace too strong a reliance upon the present prices of books, from\r\nwhat they have produced at former sales; as nothing is more\r\ncapricious and unsettled than the value of books at a public auction.\r\nBut, in regard to these catalogues, if you should be fortunate enough\r\nto possess any which are printed upon _Large Paper, with the Names of\r\nthe Purchasers, and the Prices_ for which each set of books was sold,\r\nthrice and four times happy may you account yourself to be, my good\r\nLisardo!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 162: As it would have required more breath than\r\n     usually falls to the lot of an individual, for Lysander to\r\n     have given even a rough sketch of the merits, demerits, and\r\n     rarity of certain foreign catalogues of public and private\r\n     collections--in his discourse with his friends--I have\r\n     ventured to supply the deficiency by subjoining, in the\r\n     ensuing _tolerably copious_ note, a list of these\r\n     catalogues, alphabetically arranged; as being, perhaps, the\r\n     most convenient and acceptable plan. Such an attempt is\r\n     quite novel; and must be received, therefore, with many\r\n     grains of allowance. Although I am in possession of the\r\n     greater number (at least of two thirds) of the catalogues\r\n     described, I am aware that, in regard to the description of\r\n     those not in my own library, I subject myself to the lash of\r\n     P. Morhof. \"Inepti sunt, qui librorum catalogos scribunt e\r\n     catalogis. Oculata fides et judicium præsens requiritur.\"\r\n     _Polyhist. Literar._, vol. i., 230. But the weight of my\r\n     authorities will, I trust, secure me from any great violence\r\n     of critical indignation. To render so dry a subject (the\r\n     very \"_Hortus Siccus_\" of bibliography) somewhat palatable,\r\n     I have here and there besprinkled it with biographical\r\n     anecdotes of the collectors, and of the state of French\r\n     literature in the last century and a half.----D'AGUESSEAU.\r\n     _Catalogue des Livres Imprimés et Manuscrits de la\r\n     Bibliothéque de feu Monsieur D'Aguesseau_, &c., Paris, 1785,\r\n     8vo. \"Anxious to enrich his collection, (says the compiler\r\n     of this catalogue) the Bibliomaniac sees with delight the\r\n     moment arrive when, by the sale of a library like this, he\r\n     may add to his precious stores. It is, in truth, a grand\r\n     collection; especially of history, arts, and sciences, and\r\n     jurisprudence. The famous Chancellor D'Aguesseau laid the\r\n     foundation of this library, which was as universal as his\r\n     own genius.\" It would appear that the son, to whom the\r\n     collection latterly belonged, was gracious in the extreme in\r\n     the loan of books; and that, in consequence, a public\r\n     advertisement was inserted at the foot of the \"Avis\r\n     preliminaire,\" to entreat those, who had profited by such\r\n     kindness, to return their borrowed (shall I say stolen?)\r\n     goods? For want of these volumes, many sets of books were\r\n     miserably defective.----ANONYMIANA. _Catalogus Bibliothecæ\r\n     Anonymianæ, in quo libri rariores recensentur, una cum notis\r\n     litterariis_, Norimb., 1738, 8vo. This is a catalogue of\r\n     value, and may be well ranged with its brethren upon the\r\n     bibliographer's shelf. Another \"_Bibliotheca Anonymiana_,\"\r\n     was published ten years preceding the present one; at the\r\n     Hague, in three parts, one vol., 8vo.: which, in the _Bibl.\r\n     Solger._, vol iii., no. 1388, is said to contain many\r\n     rare books: see also no. 1370, _ibid._----D'ARTOIS.\r\n     _Catalogue des Livres du Cabinet de Monseigneur Le Compte\r\n     D'Artois_, Paris, 1783, 8vo. Very few copies of this\r\n     catalogue, which is printed in a wide octavo page,\r\n     resembling that of a quarto, were struck off: according to\r\n     Fournier's _Dict. Portat. de Bibliogr._, p. 120, edit. 1809.\r\n     See also _Cat. de Boutourlin_, no. 3876.----AUGUSTANA.\r\n     _Catalogus Bibliothecæ inclytæ Reipubl. Augustanæ utriusque\r\n     linguæ tum Græcæ tum Latinæ librorum et impressorum et manu\r\n     exaratorum._ Aug. Vindel., 1600, fol. Morhof informs us that\r\n     this catalogue, of which Hoeschelius was the compiler,\r\n     contains an account of some manuscripts which have never\r\n     been printed, as well as of some which Marcus Velserus\r\n     published. It is, moreover, full of precious bibliographical\r\n     matter; but unfortunately (the possessor of it may think\r\n     otherwise) only ONE HUNDRED COPIES were struck off.\r\n     _Polyhist. Literar._, vol. i., 211. I find, however, some\r\n     little difficulty about distinguishing this catalogue of the\r\n     Augsbourg library from the impression of 1633, fol., which\r\n     Vogt mentions at p. 323, and of which he also talks of 100\r\n     copies being printed. It should not be forgotten that\r\n     Hoeschelius published an admirable catalogue of the Greek\r\n     MSS. in the library of Augsbourg, 1595, and again 1605, in\r\n     4to. Colomiés pronounces it a model in its way. _Bibl.\r\n     Choisie_, p. 194-5. The catalogue of the Greek MSS. in the\r\n     library of the Duke of Bavaria, at Munich, was published\r\n     about the same period; namely, in 1602: the compiler was a\r\n     skilful man, but he tells us, at the head of the catalogue,\r\n     that the MSS. were open to the inspection of every one who\r\n     had any work in hand, provided he were a _Roman Catholic_!\r\n     This was being very kind to protestants! _Jugemens des\r\n     Savans_, vol. ii., part i., p. 215, edit. 1725. See also\r\n     Vogt's _Catalog. Libror. Rarior._, p. 232.----AUGUSTANA.\r\n     _Notitia historica-literaria de libris ab artis typographicæ\r\n     inventione usque ad annum, 1478, impressis, in Bibliotheca\r\n     Monasterii ad SS. Udalricum et Afram Augustæ extantibus._\r\n     August, Vindel, 1788, 4to. This volume, which I have no\r\n     doubt would gratify the curious bibliographer, it has never\r\n     been my good fortune to meet with. It is here introduced\r\n     upon the authority of the _Cat. du Cardinal de Loménie_,\r\n     no. 2647: ed. 1797. I ought not to close this account of\r\n     the Augsbourg catalogues of books, without remarking, on the\r\n     authority of Reimannus, that the _first_ published catalogue\r\n     of books is that which Villerius, a bookseller at Augsburg,\r\n     put forth in the year 1564. See the _Bibl. Acroam._, p.\r\n     5.----AURIVILLIUS. _Catalogus Bibliothecæ quam collegerat\r\n     Carolus Aurivillius_, sectio [Transcriber's Note: section]\r\n     i. and ii., Upsal, 1787, 8vo. This catalogue contains a\r\n     plentiful sprinkling of short literary and bibliographical\r\n     notes; according to _Bibl. Krohn_, p. 256, no.\r\n     3582.----BADENHAUPT. _Bibliotheca selectissima; sive\r\n     Catalogus librorum magnam partem philologicorum, quos inter\r\n     eminent. Auctores Græci et Romani classica quos collegit\r\n     E.F. Badenhaupt_, Berol, 1773, 8vo. The pithy\r\n     bibliographical notes which are here and there scattered\r\n     throughout this catalogue, render it of estimation in the\r\n     opinion of the curious.----BALUZE. _Bibliotheca Balusiana;\r\n     seu catalogus librorum bibliothecæ D.S. Baluzii, A. Gab.\r\n     Martin_, Paris, 1719, 8vo., two vols. Let any enlightened\r\n     bibliographers read the eulogy upon the venerable Baluze\r\n     (who died in his eighty-eighth year, and who was the great\r\n     Colbert's librarian), in the preface of the _Bibl.\r\n     Colbertina_ (vide post), and in the _Dict. Hist._ (Caen,\r\n     1789, vol. i., p. 443-4), and he will not hesitate a moment\r\n     about the propriety of giving this volume a conspicuous\r\n     place upon his shelf. From the _Bibl. Mencken_, p. 10, it\r\n     would appear that a third volume, containing translations of\r\n     some MSS. in the royal library, is wanting to make this\r\n     catalogue complete. This third volume is\r\n     uncommon.----BARBERINI. _Index Bibliothecæ Francisci\r\n     Barberini Cardinalis. Romæ, Typis Barberinis_, 1681, fol.,\r\n     three vols. in two. The widely spread celebrity of Cardinal\r\n     Barberini suffers no diminution from this publication of the\r\n     riches contained within his library. The authors are\r\n     arranged alphabetically, and not according to classes.\r\n     Although it be not the most luminous in its arrangement, or\r\n     the most accurate in its execution, this finely printed\r\n     catalogue will never remain long upon a bookseller's shelf\r\n     without a purchaser. It were much to be desired that our own\r\n     noblemen, who have fine collections of books, would put\r\n     forth (after the example of Cardinal Barberini) similar\r\n     publications.----BARTHELEMY. _Catalogue des Livres de la\r\n     Bibliothéque de M. l'Abbé Barthelemy, par M. Bernard_, 1800,\r\n     8vo. The high reputation of the owner of this collection\r\n     will always secure purchasers for this catalogue of useful\r\n     and interesting books.----BIBLIOGRAPHIE _des Pays Bas, avec\r\n     quelques notes. Nyon, en Suisse_, 1783, 4to. Only fifty\r\n     copies of this work were printed. It is a pity that Peignot,\r\n     who gives us this information, does not accompany it with\r\n     some account of the nature and merits of the work--which\r\n     probably grew out of the _Histoire Littéraire des Pays\r\n     Blas_, 1725, in three folio volumes. _Bibl. Curieuse_, p.\r\n     10.----BODLEIAN. _Catalog. Libr. Bibl. Publ., &c., in Acad.\r\n     Oxon._, 1605, 4to. _Catal. Libr. Impr._, 1674, fol.\r\n     _Catalogi Libror. MSS. Angl. et Hibern._, 1697, fol.\r\n     _Catalogus Impress. Libror. Bibl. Bodl._, 1733, fol., two\r\n     vols. Although none but catalogues of foreign public and\r\n     private collections were intended to be noticed in this\r\n     list, the reader will forgive a little violation of the rule\r\n     laid down by myself, if I briefly observe upon the\r\n     catalogues of the Bodleian library and the British Museum.\r\n     [For the latter, vide 'MUSEUM.'] The first of these Bodleian\r\n     catalogues contains an account of the MSS. It was prepared\r\n     by Dr. James, the editor of the Philobiblion of De Bury\r\n     (vide p. 30, ante), and, as it was the first attempt to\r\n     reduce to \"lucid order\" the indigested pile of MSS.\r\n     contained in the library, its imperfections must be\r\n     forgiven. It was afterwards improved, as well as enlarged,\r\n     in the folio edition of 1697, by Bernard; which contains the\r\n     MSS. subsequently bequeathed to the library by Selden,\r\n     Digby, and Laud, alone forming an extensive and valuable\r\n     collection. The editor of Morhof (vol. i., 193, n.) has\r\n     highly commended this latter catalogue. Let the purchaser of\r\n     it look well to the frontispiece of the portraits of Sir\r\n     Thomas Bodley and of the fore-mentioned worthies, which\r\n     faces the title-page; as it is frequently made the prey of\r\n     some prowling Grangerite. The first catalogue of the\r\n     _Printed Books_ in the Bodleian library was compiled by the\r\n     celebrated orientalist, Dr. Hyde: the second by Fisher: of\r\n     these, the latter is the more valuable, as it is the more\r\n     enlarged. The plan adopted in both is the same: namely, the\r\n     books are arranged alphabetically, without any reference to\r\n     their classes--a plan fundamentally erroneous: for the chief\r\n     object in catalogues of public collections is to know what\r\n     works are published upon particular subjects, for the\r\n     facility of information thereupon--whether our inquiries\r\n     lead to publication or otherwise: an alphabetical index\r\n     should, of course, close the whole. It is with reluctance my\r\n     zeal for literature compels me to add that a _Catalogue\r\n     Raisonnée of the Manuscripts and Printed Books in the\r\n     Bodleian Library_ is an urgent desideratum--acknowledged by\r\n     every sensible and affectionate son of ALMA MATER. Talent\r\n     there is, in abundance, towards the completion of such an\r\n     honourable task; and the only way to bring it effectually\r\n     into exercise is to employ heads and hands enough upon the\r\n     undertaking. Let it be remembered what Wanley and Messrs.\r\n     Planta and Nares have done for the Cottonian and Harleian\r\n     MSS.--and what Mr. Douce is now doing for those of the\r\n     Lansdowne collection! One gentleman alone, of a very\r\n     distinguished college, in whom the acuteness and solidity of\r\n     Porson seem almost revived, might do wonders for the Greek\r\n     MSS., and lend an effectual aid towards the arrangement of\r\n     the others. The printed books might be assigned, according\r\n     to their several classes, to the gentlemen most conversant\r\n     with the same; and the numerous bibliographical works,\r\n     published since the catalogue of 1733, might be occasionally\r\n     referred to, according to the plan observed in the _Notitia\r\n     Editionum vel Primariæ, &c., in Bibl. Bodl. Oxon._, 1795,\r\n     8vo.; which was judiciously drawn up by the Bishop of\r\n     London, and the Rev. Dr. William Jackson. I am aware that\r\n     the aged hands of the present venerable librarian of the\r\n     Bodleian library can do little more than lay the\r\n     foundation-stone of such a massive superstructure; but even\r\n     this would be sufficient to enrol his name with the\r\n     Magliabecchis and Baillets of former times--to entitle him\r\n     to be classed among the best benefactors to the library--and\r\n     to shake hands with its immortal founder, in that place\r\n     where are\r\n\r\n                          et amoena vireta\r\n          Fortunatorum nemorum, sedesque beatæ.\r\n\r\n     BONNIER. _Catalogue des livres de la Bibliothéque de\r\n     Bonnier._ Paris, 1800, 8vo. This catalogue is here\r\n     introduced to the bibliographer's notice in order to sharpen\r\n     his bibliomaniacal appetite to obtain one of the four copies\r\n     only which were printed upon LARGE PAPER of Dutch\r\n     manufacture. See _Cat. de Caillard_ (1808), no.\r\n     2596.----BOUTOURLIN. _Catalogue des livres de la\r\n     Bibliothéque de S.E.M. Le Comte de Boutourlin._ Paris (an.\r\n     xiii.), 1805, 8vo. Every one must conceive a high respect\r\n     for the owner of this choice collection, from the amiable\r\n     sentiments which pervade the preface to the catalogue. It\r\n     has a good index; and is elegantly printed. My copy is upon\r\n     LARGE PAPER.----DE BOZE. _Catalogue des Livres du Cabinet de\r\n     M. Claude Gros de Boze._ Paris. _De l'Imp. Royale_, 1745,\r\n     small folio. This is the first printed catalogue of the\r\n     choice and magnificent library of De Boze, the friend and\r\n     correspondent of Dr. Mead, between whom presents of books\r\n     were continually passing--as they were the first collectors\r\n     of the day in their respective countries. Some have said 50,\r\n     some 35, others 25, and others ONLY 12 COPIES of this\r\n     impression were struck off, as presents for the collector's\r\n     friends. Consult _Bibl. Mead_, p. 81, no. 617. _Bibl.\r\n     Creven._, vol. v., 291. _Bauer's Bibl. Rarior._, vol. i.,\r\n     151. _Bibl. Curieuse_, p. 12. _Bibl. Askev._, no. 508.\r\n     Barbier's _Dict. des Anonymes_, vol. ii., no. 8002.----DE\r\n     BOZE, _de la même bibliothéque_, 1753, 8vo. This catalogue,\r\n     which was executed by Martin, after the death of De Boze,\r\n     does not contain all the notices of works mentioned in the\r\n     preceding one. It is, however, well deserving of a place in\r\n     the bibliographer's library. Peignot tells us that there was\r\n     yet a _third_ catalogue printed, in 8vo., containing 192\r\n     pages, and giving an account of some books taken out of De\r\n     Boze's collection: a few of which are described in the\r\n     preceding edition of 1753. See his _Bibl. Cur._, p.\r\n     12.----BOZERIAN. _Notice des livres précieux ye\r\n     [Transcriber's Note: de] M. Bozérian, par M. Bailly_, 1798,\r\n     8vo. A cabinet of \"precious books,\" indeed! The misfortune\r\n     is, so small a number of modern foreign catalogues come over\r\n     here that the best of them will be found in few of our\r\n     libraries. Whenever the \"Bibliotheca Bozeriana\" shall be\r\n     imported, it will not stop seven days upon a bookseller's\r\n     shelf!----BULTEAU. _Bibliotheca Bultelliana; (Caroli\r\n     Bulteau) a Gabr. Martin_, Paris, 1711, 12mo., 2 vols. in\r\n     one. This catalogue, which is carefully compiled, contains\r\n     curious and uncommon books; many of which were purchased for\r\n     the collections of Préfond, De Boze, and others.----BUNAU.\r\n     _Catalogus Bibliothecæ Bunavianæ._ Lipsiæ, 1750. Six parts,\r\n     in three volumes, each volume having two parts--usually\r\n     bound in six vols. Highly and generally esteemed as is this\r\n     extensive collection, and methodically arranged catalogue,\r\n     of Count Bunau's books, the latter has always appeared to me\r\n     as being branched out into too numerous ramifications, so as\r\n     to render the discovery of a work, under its particular\r\n     class, somewhat difficult, without reference to the index. I\r\n     am aware that what Camus says is very true--namely, that\r\n     \"nothing is more absurd than to quarrel about\r\n     catalogue-making: and that every man ought to have certain\r\n     fixed and decisive ideas upon the subject,\" [_Mem. de\r\n     l'Inst._ vol. i., 650,] but simplicity and perspicuity,\r\n     which are the grand objects in every undertaking, might have\r\n     been, in my humble apprehension, more successfully exhibited\r\n     than in this voluminous catalogue. It represents _over-done\r\n     analysis_! yet those who are writing upon particular\r\n     subjects will find great assistance in turning to the\r\n     different works here specified upon the same. It is rare and\r\n     high-priced. From the preface, which is well worth an\r\n     attentive perusal, it appears that this grand collection,\r\n     now deposited in the electoral library at Dresden (see _Cat.\r\n     de Caillard_, no. 2545, 1808,) was at Count Bunau's\r\n     country-house, situated in a pleasant village about half a\r\n     mile from Dresden--\r\n\r\n          Vicinam videt unde lector urbem.\r\n\r\n     Saxius, in his _Onomast. Literar._, vol i., p. xxxiii.,\r\n     edit. 1775, &c., has a smart notice of this splendid\r\n     collection.----BUNNEMAN. _J.L. Bunnemanni Catalogus\r\n     Manuscriptorum, item librorum impressorum rarissimorum pro\r\n     assignato pretio venalium._ Minda, 1732, 8vo. For the sake\r\n     of knowing, by way of curiosity, what books (accounted rare\r\n     at this period) were sold for, the collector may put this\r\n     volume into his pocket, when he finds it upon a book-stall\r\n     marked at 1_s._ 6_d._ In the _Bibl. Solger._, vol iii.,\r\n     no. 1396, there was a priced copy upon LARGE PAPER with\r\n     bibliographical memoranda.----CAILLARD. _Catalogue des\r\n     livres du Cabinet de M.A.B. Caillard_, Paris, 1805, 8vo. Of\r\n     this private catalogue, compiled by Caillard himself, and\r\n     printed upon fine Dutch paper, in super-royal 8vo., only\r\n     twenty-five copies were struck off. So says Fournier, _Dict.\r\n     Portatif de Bibliographie_: p. 120; edit. 1809, and the\r\n     \"avant-propos\" prefixed to the subsequent catalogue here\r\n     following:----_Livres rares et précieux de la Bibliothéque\r\n     de feu M. Ant. Bern. Caillard_, Paris, 1808, 8vo. There were\r\n     but twenty-five copies of this catalogue of truly valuable,\r\n     and, in many respects, rare, and precious, books, printed\r\n     upon LARGE PAPER, of the same size as the preceding. This\r\n     was the sale catalogue of the library of Caillard, who died\r\n     in 1807, in his sixty-ninth year, and of whose\r\n     bibliomaniacal spirit we have a most unequivocal proof in\r\n     his purchasing De Cotte's celebrated uncut copy of the first\r\n     printed Homer, at an enormous sum! [vide COTTE, post.] \"Sa\r\n     riche bibliothéque est á-la-fois un monument de son amour\r\n     pour l'art typographique, et de la vaste étendue de ses\r\n     connoissances,\" p. xiv. Some excellent indexes close this\r\n     volume; of which Mr. Payne furnished me with the loan of his\r\n     copy upon LARGE PAPER.----CAMBIS. _Catalogue des principaux\r\n     manuscrits du cabinet de M. Jos. L.D. de Cambis_, Avignon,\r\n     1770, 4to. Although this is a catalogue of MSS., yet, the\r\n     number of copies printed being very few, I have given it a\r\n     place here. Some of these copies contain but 519, others\r\n     766, pages; which shews that the owner of the MSS. continued\r\n     publishing his account of them as they increased upon him.\r\n     Rive, in his \"_Chasse aux bibliographes_,\" has dealt very\r\n     roughly with the worthy Cambis; but Peignot tells us that\r\n     this latter was a respectable literary character, and a\r\n     well-informed bibliographer--and that his catalogue, in\r\n     spite of Rive's diatribe, is much sought after. See the\r\n     _Bibliogr. Curieuse_, p. 14; also _Cat. de la Valliere_,\r\n     vol. iii., no. 5543.----CAMUS DE LIMARE. _Catalogues des\r\n     livres de M. le Camus de Limare_, Paris, 1779, 12mo.--_Des\r\n     livres rares et précieux de M---- (Camus de Limare)_, Paris,\r\n     1786, 8vo.--_Des livres rares et précieux, reliés en\r\n     maroquin, de la bibliothéque du même, Paris, an trois_\r\n     (1795), 8vo. Of the _first_ catalogue only a small number of\r\n     copies was printed, and those for presents. _Bibliogr.\r\n     Curieuse_, p. 15. It contains a description of De Boze's\r\n     extraordinary copy of Du Fresnoy's \"Methode pour étudier\r\n     l'Histoire,\" 1729, 4to., four volumes, with the supplement,\r\n     1740, two vols.; which was sold for 1500 livres; and which\r\n     was, of course, upon LARGE PAPER, with a thousand inviting\r\n     additions, being much more complete than the similar copies\r\n     in _Cat. de Valliere_, no. 4467; and _Cat. de Crevenna_,\r\n     no. 5694, edit. 1789; although this latter was preferable\r\n     to the Valliere copy. Consult also the _Curiosités\r\n     Bibliographiques_, p. 77-8. The _second_ catalogue was\r\n     prepared by De Bure, and contains a very fine collection of\r\n     natural history, which was sold at the Hôtel de Bullion. The\r\n     printed prices are added. The _third_ catalogue, which was\r\n     prepared by Santus, after the decease of Camus, contains\r\n     some very choice articles [many printed UPON VELLUM] of\r\n     ancient and modern books superbly bound.----CATALOGUE _des\r\n     livres rares. Par Guillaume de Bure, fils âiné._ Paris,\r\n     1786, 8vo. We are told, in the advertisement, that this\r\n     collection was formed from a great number of sales of\r\n     magnificent libraries, and that particular circumstances\r\n     induced the owner to part with it. The books were in the\r\n     finest order, and bound by the most skilful binders. The\r\n     bibliographical notices are short, but judicious; and a good\r\n     index closes the catalogue. The sale took place at the Hôtel\r\n     de Bullion.----CATALOGUE _fait sur un plan nouveau,\r\n     systématique et raisonné, d'une Bibliothéque de Littérature,\r\n     particulièrement d'Histoire et de Poésie, &c._ Utrecht,\r\n     1776, 8vo., two vols. A judicious and luminous arrangement\r\n     of 19,000 articles, or sets of books; which, in the\r\n     departments specified in the title-page, are singularly\r\n     copious and rich.----CATALOGUS _Librorum rarissimorum, ab\r\n     Artis Typographicæ inventoribus, aliisque ejus artis\r\n     Principibus ante annum 1500 excusorum; omnium optime\r\n     conservatorum_, 8vo., _Sine loco aut anno_. Peignot, who has\r\n     abridged Vogt's excellent account of this very uncommon and\r\n     precious catalogue, of which ONLY TWENTY-FIVE COPIES were\r\n     printed, has forgotten to examine the last edition of the\r\n     _Catalog. Libror. Rarior._, pp. 262-3; in which we find that\r\n     the collection contained 248 (and not 217) volumes. At the\r\n     end, it is said: \"Pretiosissima hæc Librorum Collectio,\r\n     cujusvis magni Principis Bibliotheca dignissima, constat\r\n     voll. ccxlviii.\" Consult the respectable references in Vogt,\r\n     _ibid._; also the _Bibliogr. Curieuse_ of Peignot, p.\r\n     15.----CERAN. _Catalogue des livres de M. Mel de Saint\r\n     Ceran._ Paris, 1780, 8vo., again in 1791, 8vo. These\r\n     catalogues were compiled by De Bure, and are carefully\r\n     executed. Some of the books noticed in them are sufficiently\r\n     curious and rare.----CLEMENTINO-VATICANA. _Bibliotheca\r\n     Orientalis Clementino Vaticana, in quâ manuscriptos codices\r\n     Orientalium Linguarum recensuit Joseph Simonius Assemanus_,\r\n     Romæ, 1719. Folio, four vols. Asseman's son compiled an\r\n     excellent catalogue of the Oriental MSS. in the\r\n     Medico-Laurentian library; but this work of the father is\r\n     more curious and elaborate. Whenever a few half-guineas can\r\n     procure it, let the country-settled philologist send his\r\n     \"henchman\" to fly for it!--\"Speed, Malise, speed.\" But alas!\r\n     Santander tells us that copies of it are rare. _Cat. de\r\n     Santander_, vol. iv., no. 6287.----COLBERT. _Bibliotheca\r\n     Colbertina: seu Catalogus Librorum Bibliothecæ quæ fuit\r\n     primum J.B. Colbert, deinde J.B. Colbert (fil) postea J.\r\n     Nic. Colbert, ac demum C.L. Colbert._ Parisiis, 1728, 8vo.,\r\n     three vols. The preface to this valuable catalogue (executed\r\n     by Martin) gives us a compressed, but sufficiently\r\n     perspicuous, account of the auspices under which such an\r\n     extensive and magnificent collection was assembled and\r\n     arranged. It contains not fewer than 18,219 articles; being\r\n     perhaps 60,000 volumes. The celebrated Baluze was the\r\n     librarian during the life of the former branches of the\r\n     Colbert family; a family which, if nothing remained to\r\n     perpetuate their fame but this costly monument of literary\r\n     enterprise, will live in the grateful remembrance of\r\n     posterity--but it wants not even such a splendid memorial!\r\n     The lover of fine and curious books will always open the\r\n     volumes of the COLBERT CATALOGUE with a zest which none but\r\n     a thorough bred bibliomaniac can ever hope to\r\n     enjoy.----CONSEIL D'ETAT. _Catalogue des livres de la\r\n     Bibliothéque du Conseil d'Etat (par M. Barbier,\r\n     Bibliothecaire du Conseil d'Etat)._ Paris, an. xi. (1802),\r\n     folio. \"This catalogue is most superbly executed. The\r\n     richness of the materials of which it is composed, the fine\r\n     order of its arrangement, and the skilful researches\r\n     exhibited in it relating to anonymous authors, are worthy of\r\n     the typographical luxury of the national press, from which\r\n     this curious work was put forth. It will be perfect in three\r\n     parts: the third part, containing the supplement and tables,\r\n     is now at press.\" (A.D. 1804.) The preface and table of the\r\n     divisions of this catalogue were published in a small 8vo.\r\n     volume, 1801. This information I glean from Peignot's\r\n     _Curiosités Bibliographiques_, p. lix.; and from the _Cat.\r\n     de Boutourlin_, no. 3892, I learn that only 190 copies of\r\n     so useful, as well as splendid, a work were printed, of\r\n     which the French government took upon itself the\r\n     distribution.----CORDES. _Bibliothecæ Cordesianæ Catalogus,\r\n     cum indice titulorum_, Parisiis, 1643, 4to. The celebrated\r\n     Naudé had the drawing up and publishing of this catalogue,\r\n     which is highly coveted by collectors, and is now of rare\r\n     occurrence. De Cordes was intimate with all the learned men\r\n     of his country and age; and his eulogy, by Naudé, prefixed\r\n     to the catalogue, gives us a delightful account of an\r\n     amiable and learned man living in the bosom, as it were, of\r\n     books and of book-society. This collection, which was\r\n     purchased by Cardinal Mazarin, formed the foundation of the\r\n     latter's magnificent library. Consult the _Jugemens des\r\n     Savans_, vol. ii., p. 142; Colomié's _Biblioth. Choisie_, p.\r\n     126; _Mem. de l'Inst._, vol. i., p. 647. Nor must we forget\r\n     Morhof--_Polyhist. Literar._, vol. i., p. 211; who, after a\r\n     general commendation of the collection, tells us it is\r\n     remarkable for containing a fine body of foreign history. De\r\n     Cordes died A.D. 1642, in the 72d year of his age--nearly 50\r\n     years having been devoted by him to the formation of his\r\n     library. \"Fortunate senex!\"----COTTE. _Catalogue des Livres\r\n     rares et précieux et de MSS. composant la bibliothéque de\r\n     M---- (le President de Cotte)_, Paris, 1804, 8vo. We are\r\n     told by Peignot that the books at this sale were sold for\r\n     most exorbitant sums: \"the wealthy amateurs striving to make\r\n     themselves masters of the LARGE PAPER Alduses, Elzevirs, and\r\n     Stephenses, which had been Count d'Hoym's copies.\" An uncut\r\n     first edition of Homer, in the highest state of\r\n     preservation, was purchased by Mons. Caillaird\r\n     [Transcriber's Note: Caillard] for 3,601 livres! See the\r\n     _Curiosités Bibliographiques_, pp. lxv, lxvj. According to\r\n     _Cat. de Caillard_, no. 2600 (1808, 8vo.), there were\r\n     only ten copies of this catalogue printed upon LARGE\r\n     PAPER.----COUVAY. _Catalogue de la bibliothéque de M.\r\n     Couvay, chevalier de l'ordre de Christ, secrétaire du Roi_,\r\n     Paris, 1728, fol. Very few copies of this catalogue were\r\n     printed, and those only for presents. _Bibliogr. Curieuse_,\r\n     p. 21.----CREVENNA. _Catalogue raisonnée de la collection\r\n     des Livres de M. Pierre Antoine Crevenna, Négocient à\r\n     Amsterdam_, 1776, 4to., six vols.--_De la même collection_,\r\n     1789, 8vo., five vols.--_De la même collection_, 1793, 8vo.\r\n     Of these catalogues of one of the most extensive and\r\n     magnificent collections ever formed in Amsterdam, the first\r\n     impression of 1776 (to which I have generally referred) is\r\n     by far the most valuable in regard to bibliographical\r\n     remarks and copious description. Peignot tells us that no\r\n     bibliographer can do without it. It was commenced in the\r\n     year 1774, and published during the life time of Peter\r\n     Antony Crevenna, the father; from whom the collection passed\r\n     into the hands of the son Bolongari Crevenna, and in whose\r\n     lifetime it was sold by public auction. The second\r\n     impression of 1789 is the sale-catalogue, and contains more\r\n     books than the preceding one; but the bibliographical\r\n     observations are comparatively trifling. There are copies of\r\n     this latter impression upon LARGE PAPER in quarto. I possess\r\n     an interesting copy of the small paper, which has numerous\r\n     marginal remarks in pencil, by Mr. Edwards; who examined the\r\n     library at Amsterdam, with a view to purchase it entire. The\r\n     last catalogue of 1793, which was published after the death\r\n     of the son, contains a few choice books which he had\r\n     reserved for himself, and, among them, a curious set of\r\n     fac-simile drawings of old prints and title-pages; some of\r\n     which were obtained at the sale of the elder Mirabeau (vide\r\n     post). It seems to have been the ruling passion of B.\r\n     Crevenna's life to collect all the materials, from all\r\n     quarters, which had any connection, more or less, with \"THE\r\n     ORIGIN AND PROGRESS OF PRINTING,\" and it is for ever to be\r\n     regretted that such extensive materials as those which he\r\n     had amassed, and which were sold at the sale of 1793 should\r\n     have been dissipated beyond the hope of restoration. See\r\n     Peignot's _Dict. de Bibliologie_, vol. iii., p. 100; and his\r\n     _Curiosités Bibliographiques_, p. 139.----CROZAT. _Catalogue\r\n     des Livres de Monsieur Le President Crozat de Tugny_, Paris,\r\n     1751, 8vo. This collection was particularly rich in the\r\n     belles-lettres--and especially in Italian and French\r\n     Romance-Literature.----VAN DAMME. _Catalogue d'une\r\n     Bibliotheque, vendue publiquement à la Haye, le 8 Octobre,\r\n     par Varon et Gaillard_, 1764, three vols. 8vo. \"This\r\n     precious and rare collection belonged to M. Pierre Van\r\n     Damme, book-merchant at Amsterdam, equally well known for\r\n     his knowledge of bibliography and of medals; of which latter\r\n     he had a beautiful and uncommon collection.\" _Bibl.\r\n     Crevenn._, vol. v., p. 306.----DUBOIS. _Bibliotheca\r\n     Duboisiana, ou Catalogue de la Bibliothéque du Cardinal\r\n     Dubois. A la Haye_, 1725, 8vo., four vols. A collection\r\n     which evinces the fine taste and sound judgment of the\r\n     Cardinal Du Bois. It is not rare abroad.----ELZEVIR.\r\n     _Catalogus librorum qui in Bibliopolio Officinæ Danielis\r\n     Elzevirii venales extant_, Ams. 1674, 12mo.: 1681,\r\n     12mo.--_qui in Bibliopoli Elzeviriano venales extant_, Lug.\r\n     Bat., 1634, 1684, 4to. These, and other catalogues of the\r\n     books printed by the distinguished family of the Elzevirs,\r\n     should find a place within the cabinet of bibliographers.\r\n     The first book ever published by the Elzevirs was of the\r\n     date of 1595; the last, of 1680 or 1681, by Daniel Elzevir,\r\n     who was the only surviving branch. His widow carried on the\r\n     business after his decease in 1680. In the _Dictionnaire de\r\n     Bibliologie_ of Peignot, vol. i., p. 216, vol. iii., p. 116,\r\n     will be found a pleasing account of this family of (almost)\r\n     unrivalled printers.----DU FAY. _Bibliotheca Fayana seu\r\n     Catalogus librorum Bibl. Cor. Hier. de Cisternay du Fay,\r\n     digestus à Gabriel Martin_, Paris, 1725, 8vo. The catalogue\r\n     of this collection, which is a judicious one, and frequently\r\n     referred to, is very carefully put forth by Martin. I think\r\n     that I have seen a copy of it upon LARGE PAPER.----FAGEL.\r\n     _Bibliotheca Fageliana. A catalogue of the valuable and\r\n     extensive Library of the Greffier Fagal, of the Hague: in\r\n     two parts._ London, 1802, 8vo. It is highly creditable to\r\n     that most respectable establishment, Trinity College,\r\n     Dublin, that the present grand collection of books was\r\n     purchased \"en masse\" (for 7000_l._) to be deposited within\r\n     its library; thus rendering the interior of the latter\r\n     \"companion meet\" for its magnificent exterior. The\r\n     title-page of the first part announces the sale of the books\r\n     by auction by Mr. Christie; but the above offer having been\r\n     made for the whole collection, the same was forthwith\r\n     transported to Ireland. Collectors should take care that the\r\n     second part of this catalogue be not wanting, which is\r\n     oftentimes the case. A good index only is requisite to make\r\n     the BIBLIOTHECA FAGELIANA rank with the most valuable\r\n     publications of its kind in existence. It was compiled by\r\n     the well-known S. Paterson.----FAULTRIER. _Catalogus\r\n     Librorum Bibliothecæ Domini Joachimi Faultrier, digestus à\r\n     Prosper Marchand_, Paris, 1709, 8vo. The bibliographical\r\n     introductory remarks, by Marchand, render this volume (which\r\n     rarely occurs) very acceptable to collectors of catalogues.\r\n     Maittaire has spoken well of the performance, _Annal.\r\n     Typog._ iii., p. 482. Consult also the _Mem. de l'Inst._,\r\n     vol. i., p. 675, and the _Dict. de Bibliologie_, vol. ii.,\r\n     p. 235, upon Marchand's introductory remarks relating to the\r\n     arrangement of a library.----FAVIER. _Catalogue des Livres\r\n     de la Bibliothéque de feu Mons. L'Abbé Favier, Prêtre à\r\n     Lille_, Lille, 1765, 8vo. A well arranged catalogue of a\r\n     choice collection of books, which cost the Abbé fifty years\r\n     of pretty constant labour in amassing. Prefixed, are some\r\n     interesting notices of MSS.: and, among them, of a valuable\r\n     one of Froissart. The prints of the Abbé were afterwards\r\n     sold, from a catalogue of 143 pages, printed at Lisle in the\r\n     same year.----DU FRESNE. _Raphaelis Tricheti du Fresne\r\n     Bibliothecæ Catalogus._ Paris, 1662, 4to. \"I have observed,\"\r\n     says Morhof, \"a number of authors in this catalogue which I\r\n     have in vain sought after elsewhere. The typographical\r\n     errors (especially in regard to dates, adds Baillet) are\r\n     innumerable: and the theological, legal, and medical works,\r\n     comparatively few--but in the departments of history,\r\n     antiquities, and general literature, this collection is\r\n     wonderfully enriched--containing authors hardly ever heard\r\n     of.\" _Polyhist. Literar._, vol. i., p. 212. Colomiés and\r\n     Labbe unite in conferring the highest praises upon Du Fresne\r\n     and his collection. See the _Jugemens des Savans_, vol. ii.,\r\n     p. 143; where, however, the confused and inaccurate manner\r\n     in which the catalogue is executed is sharply censured by\r\n     Baillet. Morhof informs us that this collection was disposed\r\n     of by Du Fresne's widow, to the Royal Library, for 24,000\r\n     _livres_, after she had refused 33,000 for the\r\n     same.----GAIGNAT. _Catalogue des Livres du Cabinet de feu M.\r\n     Louis Jean Gaignat, disposé et mis en ordre par Guill.\r\n     François de Bure le Jeune._ Paris, 1769, 8vo., two vols. One\r\n     of the best executed, and most intrinsically valuable\r\n     catalogues in existence. Almost all the books of Gaignat\r\n     were in the choicest condition; being the cream of the\r\n     collections of Colbert, Préfond, and De Boze. The possession\r\n     of this rare catalogue, which is indispensable to the\r\n     collector, forms what is called a Supplement to De Bure's\r\n     \"_Bibliographie Instructive_.\" There are 50 copies struck\r\n     off upon SMALL QUARTO paper, to arrange with a like number\r\n     of this latter work. Consult _Bibl. Crevenn._, vol. v., p.\r\n     291.----GENÈVE. _Catalogue raisonné des Manuscrits conservés\r\n     dans la bibliothéque, &c., de Genève; par Jean Senibier._\r\n     Genève, 1779, 8vo. A neatly executed and useful catalogue of\r\n     some manuscripts of no mean value. It has received a good\r\n     character by Mons. Van-Praet, in the _Cat. de la Valliere_,\r\n     vol. iii., no. 5542. See also p. 36, ante.----GOEZ.\r\n     _Bibliothecæ Goësinæ Catalogus_, Leidæ, 1687, 8vo. A fine\r\n     collection of books and of coins distinguished the Museum of\r\n     Goez.----GOLOWKIN. _Catalogue des Livres de la Bibliothéque\r\n     du Comte Alexis de Golowkin_, Leipsic, 1798, 4to. It is said\r\n     that ONLY 25 COPIES of this catalogue were struck off, and\r\n     that not more than two of these are known to be in France.\r\n     Neither the type nor paper has the most inviting aspect; but\r\n     it is a curious volume, and contains a description of books\r\n     \"infiniment précieux.\" Consult Peignot's _Bibliogr.\r\n     Curieuse_, p. 31. Dr. Clarke, in his _Travels in Russia,\r\n     &c._, p. 138, has noticed the extraordinary library of Count\r\n     Botterline, but says nothing of Golowkin's.----GOUTTARD.\r\n     _Catalogue des Livres rares et precieux de feu M. Gouttarde\r\n     par Guillaume de Bure fils aîné._ Paris, 1780, 8vo. A short\r\n     bibliographical notice of the amiable and tasteful owner of\r\n     this select collection precedes the description of the\r\n     books. The bibliographical observations are sometimes\r\n     copious and valuable. This catalogue is indispensable to the\r\n     collector.----GUYON. _Catalogue des livres de la\r\n     Bibliothéque de feu M.J.B. Denis Guyon, Chev. Seigneur de\r\n     Sardiere, Ancien Capitaine au Regiment du Roi, et l'un des\r\n     Seigneurs du Canal de Briare._ Paris, 1759, 8vo. It is\r\n     justly said, in the \"advertisement\" prefixed to this\r\n     catalogue, that, in running over the different classes of\r\n     which the collection is composed, there will be found\r\n     articles \"capable de piquer la curiosité des bibliophiles.\"\r\n     In ancient and modern poetry, and in romances--especially\r\n     relating to chivalry--this \"ancient Captain\" appears to have\r\n     been deeply versed. The advertisement is followed by 28\r\n     pages of \"Eclaircissemens\"--which give an interesting\r\n     account of some precious manuscripts of old poetry and\r\n     romances. A MS. note, in my copy of this catalogue, informs\r\n     me that the books were sold \"en masse.\"----HEINSIUS. (NIC.)\r\n     _Nicolai Heinsii Bibliothecæ Catalogus_, (1682) 8vo. A\r\n     portrait of the elegant and learned owner of this collection\r\n     faces the title-page. The books contained in it are\r\n     remarkable both for their rarity and intrinsic value; and a\r\n     great number of them were enriched with the notes of\r\n     Scaliger, Salmasius, and others. Few collections display\r\n     more judgment and taste in the selection than the present\r\n     one; and few critics have been of more essential service to\r\n     the cause of ancient classical literature than Nicholas\r\n     Heinsius. He excelled particularly in his editions of the\r\n     poets. Mr. Dyer, of Exeter, the bookseller, has a copy of\r\n     this catalogue, which was formerly Grævius's; in which that\r\n     celebrated critic has made marginal remarks concerning the\r\n     rarity and value of certain works described in\r\n     it.----HOHENDORF. _Bibliotheca Hohendorfiana; ou Catalogue\r\n     de la Bibliothéque de feu Mons. George Guillaume Baron de\r\n     Hohendorf: à la Haye_, 1720, 8vo., three parts. A\r\n     magnificent collection; which a MS. note, by Dr. Farmer (in\r\n     my copy of the catalogue), informs me was \"added to the\r\n     Emperor's library at Vienna.\" In the _Bibl. Mencken_, p. 10,\r\n     it is thus loftily described: \"Catalogus per-rarus\r\n     rarissimis libris superbiens.\"----HOYM. _Catalogus Librorum\r\n     Bibliothecæ Caroli Henrici Comitis de Hoym_, 1738, 8vo. This\r\n     catalogue, which is exceedingly well \"digested by Martin,\"\r\n     is a great favourite with collectors. A copy out of Count\r\n     Hoym's collection tells well--whether at a book-sale, or in\r\n     a bookseller's catalogue. There are copies upon LARGE PAPER,\r\n     which, when priced, sell high.----HULSIUS. _Bibliotheca\r\n     Hulsiana, sive Catalogus Librorum quos magno labore, summa\r\n     cura et maximis sumptibus collegit Vir Consularis Samuel\r\n     Hulsius._ Hag. Com. 1730, four vols. 8vo. (the second and\r\n     third being in two parts, and the fourth in three). This is,\r\n     in sober truth, a wonderful collection of books; containing\r\n     nearly 34,000 articles--which, allowing three volumes to an\r\n     article, would make the owner to have been in possession of\r\n     100,000 volumes of printed books and MSS. The English\r\n     library, (vol. iv., pt. ii.) of nearly 3300 articles,\r\n     comprehended nearly all the best books of the day. There\r\n     were about 1200 articles of Spanish Literature. Nor was the\r\n     worthy Consul deficient in the love of the fine arts (\"hæc\r\n     est, sitque diu, Senis optimi voluptas et oblectatio,\" says\r\n     the compiler of the catalogue); having 11,000 most beautiful\r\n     prints of subjects relating to the Bible, bound up in 92\r\n     atlas folio volumes. Long live the memory of Hulsius; a\r\n     consular hero of no ordinary renown!----JENA. _Memorabilia\r\n     Bibliothecæ Academicæ Jenensis: sive designatio Codicum\r\n     manuscriptorum illa Bibliothecâ et Librorum impressorum\r\n     plerumque rariorum. Joh. Christophoro Mylio._ Jenæ, 1746,\r\n     8vo. A work of some little importance; and frequently\r\n     referred to by Vogt and Panzer. It is uncommon.----JESU SOC.\r\n     _Bibliotheca Scriptorum Societatis Jesu._ Antv., 1643. Romæ,\r\n     1676, fol. Although this work is not a professed catalogue\r\n     of books, yet, as it contains an account of the writings of\r\n     those learned men who were in the society of the\r\n     Jesuits--and as Baillet, Antonio, and Morhof, have said\r\n     every thing in commendation of it--I strongly recommend one\r\n     or the other of these editions to the bibliographer's\r\n     attention. I possess the edition of 1643; and have\r\n     frequently found the most satisfactory intelligence on\r\n     referring to it. How clever some of the Jesuits were in\r\n     their ideas of the arrangement of a library may be seen from\r\n     their \"_Systema Bibliothecæ Jesuitarum Collegii\r\n     Ludoviciani_\"--which was written by Garnier for the private\r\n     use of the Louvain college, and which is now extremely\r\n     difficult to be found. See Maichelius, _de Præcip. Bibl.\r\n     Parisiens_, p. 128. Their \"_Systema bibliothecæ collegii\r\n     Parisiensis societatis Jesu_,\" 1678, 4to. (or catalogue of\r\n     books in the college of Clermont), is handsomely noticed by\r\n     Camus in the _Mem. de l'Inst._, vol. i., 647.----JUST, ST.\r\n     _Catalogue des livres en très-petit nombre qui composent la\r\n     Bibliothéque de M. Merard de St. Just, ancien maitre-d'hotêl\r\n     de Monsieur, frère du Roi (avec les prix d'achat)._ Paris,\r\n     1783, 18mo. Of this book, printed upon superfine paper, of\r\n     the manufactory of d'Annonay, only 25 copies were struck\r\n     off. _Bibl. Curieuse_, p. 43. Another catalogue of the same\r\n     collection (perhaps a more copious one) was put forth in\r\n     1799, 8vo., prepared by M. Mauger, See _Diction.\r\n     Bibliographique_, tom. iv., p. xiv.----KROHN. _Catalogus\r\n     Bibliothecæ Præstantissimorum &c., Librorum selectum\r\n     complectentis. Libros collegit et Literariis Catalogum\r\n     Animadversionibus instruxit, B.N. Krohn. Editio altera._\r\n     Hamb. 1796, 8vo. The preface to this very excellent\r\n     collection of books is written in Latin by Rambach; and a\r\n     most interesting one it is. After giving a slight sketch of\r\n     the life and literary occupations of Krohn, he thus finishes\r\n     the picture of his death--\"Ego certe (exclaims the grateful\r\n     biographer), mi KROHNI, te amabo, et quamdiu 'spiritus hos\r\n     reget artus' gratam Tui memoriam ex animo nunquam elabi\r\n     patiar. O! me felicem, si, qua olim me beasti, amicitiâ nunc\r\n     quoque frui possem. Sed fruar aliquando, cum Deus me ad\r\n     beatorum sedes evocaverit, ac Te mihi rediderit\r\n     conjunctissimum. Vale, interim, pia anima; et quem jam\r\n     tristem reliquisti, prope diem exspecta, in tenerrimos Tuos\r\n     amplexus properantem, ac de summa, quam nunc habes,\r\n     felicitate Tibi congratulantem,\" p. xix. This is the genuine\r\n     language of heart-felt grief; language, which those who have\r\n     lost an old and good friend will know well how to\r\n     appreciate. This catalogue, which was given to me by my\r\n     friend the Rev. Dr. Gosset, 'vir in re bibliographicâ\r\n     [Greek: polymathestatos],' exhibits a fine collection of\r\n     books (3821 in number) relating to history and philology.\r\n     Some of Krohn's notes are sufficiently shrewd and\r\n     intelligent.----LAMOIGNON. _Catalogue des Livres Imprimés et\r\n     manuscrits de la Bibliothéque de M. le President de\r\n     Lamoignon (redigé par L. Fr. Delatour) avec une table des\r\n     auteurs, et des anonymes._ Paris, 1770, fol. The\r\n     bibliographer has only to hear Peignot speak in his own\r\n     language, and he will not long hesitate about the price to\r\n     be given for so precious [Transcriber's Note: 'a' missing in\r\n     original] volume: \"Catalogue fort rare, tiré a QUINZE\r\n     EXEMPLAIRES seulement, sur du papier de coton fabriqué, par\r\n     singularité, à Angoulême.\" Mr. Harris, of the Royal\r\n     Institution, possesses a copy of it, bound in\r\n     orange-coloured Morocco, which was presented to him by Mr.\r\n     Payne; and, as Alexander placed his beloved Homer--so does\r\n     he this catalogue--uner [Transcriber's Note: under] his\r\n     pillow \"quand il vent se reposer--a cause des songes\r\n     agréables qu'il doit inspirer.\" This beautiful volume, which\r\n     was printed for Lamoignon's own convenience, in supplemental\r\n     parts, does not, however, contain Baillet's interesting\r\n     Latin prefece, which may be seen in the _Jugemens des\r\n     Savans_, vol. [Transcriber's Note: volume number missing in\r\n     original] pt. ii., p. 140, ed. 1725.----LAMOIGNON. _Des\r\n     Livres de la Bibliothéque de feu M. de Lamoignon, Garde de\r\n     Sçeaux de France._ Paris, 1791, 8vo., 3 vols. These volumes\r\n     contain the sale catalogue of Lamoignon's books as they were\r\n     purchased by Mr. T. Payne, the bookseller. Like the great\r\n     libraries of Crevenna and Pinelli, this immense collection\r\n     (with the exception of the works upon French jurisprudence)\r\n     has been dissipated by public sale. It yet delights Mr.\r\n     Payne to think and to talk of the many thousand volumes\r\n     which were bound in Morocco, or Russia, or\r\n     white-calf-leather, \"with gilt on the edges\"--which this\r\n     extraordinary family of book-collectors had amassed with so\r\n     much care and assiduity. The preface gives us a short, but\r\n     pleasing, account of the bibliomanical spirit of Lamoignon's\r\n     father-in-law, Monsieur Berryer; who spent between thirty\r\n     and forty years in enriching this collection with all the\r\n     choice, beautiful, and extraordinary copies of works which,\r\n     from his ministerial situation, and the exertions of his\r\n     book-friends, it was possible to obtain. M. Berryer died in\r\n     1762, and his son-in-law in 1789.----LAMOIGNON. _Des Livres\r\n     de la même Biblothéque, par Nyon l'âiné._ Paris, 1797, 8vo.\r\n     This volume presents us with the relics of a collection\r\n     which, in its day, might have vied with the most splendid in\r\n     Europe. But every thing earthly must be\r\n     dissipated.----LANCELOT. _Catalogue des Livres de feu M.\r\n     Lancelot de l'Academie Royale des Belles Lettres._ Paris,\r\n     1741, 8vo. Those who are fond of making their libraries rich\r\n     in French History cannot dispense with this truly valuable\r\n     catalogue. Lancelot, like the elder Lamoignon, appears to\r\n     have been \"buried in the benedictions of his\r\n     countrymen\"--according to the energetic language of\r\n     Bourdaloue.----LEMARIÉ. _Catalogue des livres de feu M.\r\n     Lemarié, disposé et mis en ordre, par Guil. De Bure, fils\r\n     aîné_, Paris, 1776, 8vo. A well digested catalogue of a rich\r\n     collection of Greek and Latin Literature, which evinces a\r\n     man of taste and judgment. Nothing can be more handsomely\r\n     said of a collection than what De Bure has prefixed to the\r\n     present one. In the _Cat. de Gouttard_, no. 1545, I find\r\n     a copy of it upon LARGE PAPER.----LOMÉNIE. _Index Librorum\r\n     ab inventa Typographia da annum 1500, &c., cum notis, &c._\r\n     Senonis, 1791, 8vo., two vols. The owner of this collection,\r\n     whose name does not appear in the title-page, was the\r\n     celebrated Cardinal DE LOMÉNIE DE BRIENNE: who is described,\r\n     in the advertisement prefixed to the catalogue of his books\r\n     in 1797, [vide infra] as having, from almost early youth,\r\n     pushed his love of book-collecting to an excess hardly\r\n     equalled by any of his predecessors. When he was but a young\r\n     ecclesiastic, and had only the expectation of a fortune, his\r\n     ruling passion for books, and his attachment to fellow\r\n     bibliomaniacs, was ardent and general. But let his\r\n     panegyrist speak in his own language--\"Si le hazard\r\n     procuroit à ses amis quelque objét précieux, il n'avoit de\r\n     repos qu'aprés l'avoir obtenu; les sacrifices ne\r\n     l'effrayoient pas; il étoit né généreaux; mais ce qu'on lui\r\n     accordoit, il le devoit sur-tout à ses manières insinuantes.\r\n     Ses sollicitations étoient toujours assaisonnées d'un ton\r\n     d'amabilité auquel on résistoit difficilement. Lorsque le\r\n     tems et les grâces de la cour eurent aggrandi ses moyens,\r\n     ses veus s'etendirent à proportion. Insensiblement il\r\n     embressa tous les genres, et sa bibliothéque devint un dépôt\r\n     universel. Dans ses fréquens voyages, s'il s'arrêtoit\r\n     quelques instans dans une ville, on le voyoit visiter\r\n     lui-même les libraries, s'introduire dans les maisons\r\n     religieuses, s'insinuer dans les cabinets d'amateurs,\r\n     chercher par-tout à acquérir; c'etoit un besoin pour lui\r\n     d'acheter sans cesse, d'entasser les volumes. Cette passion\r\n     a peut-être ses excés; mais du moins, elle ne fut pas pour\r\n     le cardinal de Loménie une manie stérile. Non seulement il\r\n     aimoit, il connoissoit les livres, mais il savoit s'en\r\n     servir; sans contredit il fut un des hommes les plus\r\n     éclairés du Clergé de France.\"----To return from this\r\n     pleasing rhapsody to the catalogue, the title of which is\r\n     above given. It is composed by Laire, in the Latin language,\r\n     with sufficient bibliographical skill: but the index is the\r\n     most puzzling one imaginable. The uncommonly curious and\r\n     magnificent collection, not being disposed of \"en\r\n     masse\"--according to advertisement--was broken up; and the\r\n     more ancient books were sold by auction at Paris, in 1792,\r\n     from a French catalogue prepared by De Bure. Some of the\r\n     books were purchased by Mr. Edwards, and sold at London in\r\n     the Paris collection [vide p. 90, post]; as were also those\r\n     relating to Natural History; which latter were sold by\r\n     auction without his Eminence's name: but it is a gross error\r\n     in the _Bibl. Krohn_, p. 259, no. 3466, to say that many\r\n     of these books were impious and obscene. These are scarce\r\n     and dear volumes; and as they supply some deficiencies\r\n     [Transcriber's Note: missing 'in'] Audiffredi's account of\r\n     books published at Rome in the xvth century [vid. p. 62,\r\n     ante], the bibliographer should omit no opportunity of\r\n     possessing them.----LOMÉNIE. _D'une partie des livres de la\r\n     Bibliothéque du Cardinal de Loménie de Brienne_, Paris, an.\r\n     v. [1797], 8vo. This collection, the fragments or ruins of\r\n     the Lomenie library, contains 2754 articles, or numbers,\r\n     with a rich sprinkling of Italian literature; leaving\r\n     behind, however, a surplus of not fewer than twelve hundred\r\n     pieces relating to the Italian Drama--many of them\r\n     rare--which were to be sold at a future auction. From the\r\n     biographical memoir prefixed to this catalogue, I have given\r\n     the preceding extract concerning the character of the owner\r\n     of the collection--who died in the same year as the\r\n     sale.----MACARTHY. _Catalogue des livres rares et précieux\r\n     du cabinet de M.L.C.D.M._ (_M. Le Comte de Macarthy_),\r\n     Paris, 1779, 8vo. _Supplement au Catalogue des livres, &c._,\r\n     de M.L.C.D.M., Paris, 1779, 8vo. _Chez de Bure, fils aîné._\r\n     These books were sold in January, 1780; and great things are\r\n     said, in the advertisement, of their rarity and beauty. The\r\n     Count Macarthy has, at this moment, one of the most\r\n     magnificent collections upon the continent. His books\r\n     printed UPON VELLUM are unequalled by those of any private\r\n     collection. Of the above catalogue, a copy upon strong\r\n     writing paper occurs in the _Cat. de Gouttard_, no.\r\n     1549.----MAGLIABECHI. _Catalogus Codicum Sæculo_ xv.\r\n     _Impressorum qui in publica Bibliotheca Magliabechiana\r\n     Florentiæ adservantur. Autore Ferdinando Fossio; ejusd.\r\n     bibl. Præf._, Florent., 1793, folio, three vols. A\r\n     magnificent and truly valuable publication (with excellent\r\n     indexes) of the collection of the famous Magliabechi;\r\n     concerning whom the bibliographical world is full of curious\r\n     anecdotes. The reader may consult two volumes of letters\r\n     from eminent men to Magliabechi, published in 1745, &c.,\r\n     vide _Bibl. Pinell_, no. 8808, &c., edit. 1789: Wolfius's\r\n     edition of the _Bibliotheca Aprosiana_, p. 102; and the\r\n     Strawberry Hill[C] edition of the _Parallel between\r\n     Magliabechi and Mr. Hill_, 1758, 8vo.--an elegant and\r\n     interesting little volume. Before we come to speak of his\r\n     birth and bibliographical powers, it may be as well to\r\n     contemplate his expressive physiognomy.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration]\r\n\r\n     MAGLIABECHI was born at Florence October 29, 1633. His\r\n     parents, of low and mean rank, were well satisfied when they\r\n     got him into the service of a man who sold herbs and fruit.\r\n     He had never learned to read; and yet he was perpetually\r\n     poring over the leaves of old books that were used in his\r\n     master's shop. A bookseller, who lived in the neighbourhood,\r\n     and who had often observed this, and knew the boy could not\r\n     read, asked him one day \"what he meant by staring so much on\r\n     printed paper?\" Magliabechi said that \"he did not know how\r\n     it was, but that he loved it of all things.\" The consequence\r\n     was that he was received, with tears of joy in his eyes,\r\n     into the bookseller's shop; and hence rose, by a quick\r\n     succession, into posts of literary honour, till he became\r\n     librarian to the Grand Duke of Tuscany. In this situation\r\n     Magliabechi had nothing further, or more congenial to his\r\n     feelings, to sigh for: in the Florentine library he revelled\r\n     without cessation in the luxury of book-learning. The\r\n     strength of his memory was remarkable; one day, the Grand\r\n     Duke sent for him to ask whether he could procure a book\r\n     that was particularly scarce. \"No, sir,\" answered\r\n     Magliabechi, \"it is impossible; for there is but one in the\r\n     world, and that is in the Grand Signior's Library at\r\n     Constantinople, and is the seventh book on the second shelf\r\n     on the right hand as you go in.\" In spite of his cobwebs,\r\n     dirt, and cradle lined with books, Magliabechi reached his\r\n     81st year. Hearne has contrived to interweave the following\r\n     (rather trifling) anecdote of him, in his _Johan. Confrat.,\r\n     &c., de Reb. Glaston_, vol. ii., 486--which I give merely\r\n     because it is the fashion to covet every thing which\r\n     appertaineth to Tom Hearne. \"I have mentioned the bank where\r\n     the MSS. (concerning the Epistles of St. Ignatius; Bank\r\n     LVII.) stands, and the title of the book, because Vossius\r\n     tells us not in his preface which of the several MSS. in\r\n     this library he made use of; and to finde it out gave me so\r\n     much trouble that, if the Grand Duke's library-keeper had\r\n     not known the book, and searched it for me, I think I should\r\n     never have met with it, there being not one canon of St.\r\n     Laurence, not their library-keeper himself, nor, I believe,\r\n     any other in Florence, except this Sre. MAGLIABECHI, that\r\n     could direct me to it. The learned Bishop will be pleased to\r\n     take notice of Sre. Maliabechi's [Transcriber's Note:\r\n     Magliabechi's] civility; who, besides procuring me the Grand\r\n     Duke's leave to collate the epistles, attended himself in\r\n     the library, all the time I was there (the licence being\r\n     granted by the Grand Duke upon this condition): and since,\r\n     as a mark of his respect to the reverend bishop, hath been\r\n     pleased to present him with a book (about the Florentine\r\n     history) which I have committed to Mr. Ferne, my Lord\r\n     Lexinton's Gentleman, to be conveyed to his lordship.\" (Mr.\r\n     Ledgerd's account of his collations of the Florentine MS.\r\n     with the edition of Vossius.)----ST.

The editor is\r\n     commended in the preface of the subsequent catalogue, p.\r\n     xxxxv.----MEDICI-LORENZO. _Bibliothecæ Hebraico-Grecæ\r\n     Florentinæ sive Bibliothecæ Mediceo-Laurentianæ Catalogus ab\r\n     Antonio Maria Biscionio, &c., digestus atque editus_,\r\n     Florent., 1752, folio, two vols. in one. A grand book; full\r\n     of curious fac-similes of all sorts of things. It was begun\r\n     to be printed in 1752, but Biscioni's death, in May, 1756,\r\n     prevented the completion of the publication 'till May 1757.\r\n     See præfat., p. xxxxvii--and particularly the\r\n     colophon.----MEDICI-LORENZO. _Catalogus Codicum\r\n     Manuscriptorum, Græcorum, Latinorum, et Italicoram,\r\n     Bibliothecæ Medicæ Laurentianæ: Angelus Maria Bandinus\r\n     recensuit, illustravit edidit._ Florent., 1764; 3 vols.,\r\n     1774; 5 vols., folio. An equally splendid work with the\r\n     preceding--and much more copious and erudite in regard to\r\n     intrinsically valuable matter. The indexes are excellent. No\r\n     extensive philological library should be without these\r\n     volumes--especially since the name of MEDICI has recently\r\n     become so popular, from the able biographical memoirs of the\r\n     family by Mr. Roscoe.----MENARSIANA. _Bibliotheca\r\n     Menarsiana; ou Catalogue de la Bibliothéque de feu Messire\r\n     Jean Jaques Charron, Chevalier Marquis de Menars_, &c. A La\r\n     Haye, 1720, 8vo. A very fine collection of books in all\r\n     branches of literature. After the \"Ordo Venditionis,\" there\r\n     is an additional leaf pasted in, signifying that a\r\n     magnificent copy of Fust's bible of 1462, upon paper, would\r\n     be sold immediately after the theological MSS. in folio. It\r\n     brought the sum of 1200 florins. The sale commenced at nine\r\n     and at two; giving the buyers time to digest their\r\n     purchases, as well as their dinners, at twelve! \"Tempora\r\n     mutantur!\"----MENCKENIUS. _Catalogus Bibliothecæ Menckenianæ\r\n     ab Ottone et Burchardo collectæ.

There are some curious and\r\n     uncommon books in this collection; which evince the taste\r\n     and judgment of Menckenius, who was a scholar of no mean\r\n     reputation. Perhaps the word \"rare\" is too lavishly bestowed\r\n     upon some of the books described in it.----MEON. _Catalogue\r\n     des livres précieux singuliéres et rares de la Bibliothèque\r\n     de M.

Mérigot, Libraire_, par M.\r\n     De Bure, 1800, 8vo. It is very seldom that this catalogue\r\n     appears in our own country: which is the more provoking as\r\n     the references to it, in foreign bibliographical works,\r\n     render its possession necessary to the collector. Mérigot\r\n     was an eminent bookseller, and prepared a good catalogue of\r\n     M. Lorry's library, which was sold in 1791, 8vo.----ST.\r\n     MICHAEL. _Bibliotheca Codicum Manuscriptorum Monasterij\r\n     Sancti Michaelis Venetiarum, una cum appendice librorum\r\n     impressorum sæculi_ xv. _Opus posthumum Joannis Bened.\r\n     Mittarelli._ Venet., 1779, folio. It were much to be wished\r\n     that, after the example of this and other monasteries, all\r\n     religious houses, which have large libraries attached to\r\n     them, would publish accounts of their MSS. and printed\r\n     books. There is no knowing what treasures are hid in them,\r\n     and of which the literary world must remain ignorant, unless\r\n     they are thus introduced to general notice. How many curious\r\n     and amusing anecdotes may be told of precious works being\r\n     discovered under barbarous titles! Among others, take,\r\n     gentle reader, the two following ones--relating to books of\r\n     a very different character. Within a volume, entitled\r\n     _Secreta Alberti_, were found \"_The Fruyte of Redempcyon_,\"\r\n     printed by W. De Worde, 1532, 4to.; and a hitherto\r\n     imperfectly described impression of _The Boke of Fyshinge_,\r\n     printed by W. De Worde, in 4to., without date; which usually\r\n     accompanies that fascinating work, ycleped Dame Juliana\r\n     Barnes's _Boke of Hawkyng, Huntyng, and Cote Armoor_. My\r\n     friend Mr. J. Haslewood first made me acquainted with this\r\n     rare treasure--telling me he had \"a famous tawny little\r\n     volume\" to shew me: his pulse, at the same time, I ween,\r\n     beating one hundred and five to the minute! The second\r\n     anecdote more exactly accords with the nature of my\r\n     preliminary observations. In one of the libraries abroad,\r\n     belonging to the Jesuits, there was a volume entitled, on\r\n     the back of it \"_Concilium Tridenti_:\" the searching eye and\r\n     active hands of a well-educated Bibliomaniac discovered and\r\n     opened this volume--when lo! instead of the _Council of\r\n     Trent_, appeared the _First_, and almost unknown, _Edition_\r\n     of the _Decameron of Boccaccio_! This precious volume is now\r\n     reposing upon the deserted shelves of the late Duke of\r\n     Roxburgh's library; and, at the forth-coming sale of the\r\n     same, it will be most vigorously contended for by all the\r\n     higher and more knowing powers of the bibliographical world;\r\n\r\n          But when the gods descending swell'd the fight,\r\n          Then tumult rose; fierce rage and pale affright\r\n          Varied each face:\r\n\r\n          [_Pope's_] _Homer's Iliad_, b. xx. v. 63.\r\n\r\n     MIRABEAU. _Catalogue de la Bibliotheque de Mirabeau l'aîné,\r\n     par Rozet_, 1792, 8vo. A fine collection of books; some of\r\n     them very curious and uncommon. At the head of the choice\r\n     things contained in it must be noticed the \"Recueil de\r\n     Calques, ou dessins des titres et figure d'un grand nombre\r\n     des plus anciens ouvrages, gravés en bois, ou imprimés en\r\n     caractères mobiles, depuis l'origine de l'imprimerie,\" &c.\r\n     These designs were 226 in number; of which a description is\r\n     given at the head of the catalogue. They were purchased for\r\n     1105 livres, and again sold, with the same description\r\n     prefixed, at the last Crevenna sale of 1793 (see p. 79,\r\n     ante). Consult the _Curiosités Bibliographiques_ of Peignot,\r\n     p. 139.----MIROMENIL. _Catalogue des Livres de la\r\n     Bibliothéque de M. Hüe de Miromenil, garde des sceaux de\r\n     France_, Paris, 1781, 4to. \"It appears, from the catalogue\r\n     of M. de Coste, that this is a rare book, of which only few\r\n     copies were printed, and those never sold.\" _Bibliogr.\r\n     Curieuse_, p. 33.----MONTFAUÇON. _Diarium Italicum; sive\r\n     Monumentorum Veterum, Bibliothecarum, Musæorum Notitiæ\r\n     Singulares a D. Bernardo de Montfauçon_, Paris, 1702, 4to.\r\n     _Bibliotheca Bibliothecarum Manuscriptorum nova, autore De\r\n     Bern. de Montfauçon_, Paris, 1739, folio, two vols. These\r\n     are the bibliographical works (which I thought would be\r\n     acceptable if placed in this list of Catalogues) of the\r\n     illustrious Montfauçon; whose publications place him on the\r\n     summit of antiquarian fame. So much solid sense, careful\r\n     enquiry, curious research, and not despicable taste, mark\r\n     his voluminous productions! The bibliographer may rest\r\n     assured that he will not often be led into confusion or\r\n     error in the perusal of the above curious and valuable\r\n     volumes, which have always been considered precious by the\r\n     philologist.----MORELLI. _Jacobi Morellii Bibliothecæ Regiæ\r\n     divi Marci Venetiarum Custodis, Bibliotheca Manuscripta\r\n     Græca et Latina._ Tom. prim. Bassani, 8vo. Morelli was the\r\n     amiable and profoundly learned librarian of St. Mark's at\r\n     Venice; and this catalogue of his Greek and Latin MSS. is\r\n     given upon the authority of Peignot's _Curiosités\r\n     Bibliographiques_, p. lix.----MUSEUM BRITISH. _Catalogus\r\n     Librorum Manuscript. Bibl. Cotton._, Oxon., 1696, fol. _A\r\n     Catalogue of the Manuscripts in the Cottonian Library_,\r\n     Lond. 1777, 8vo. _A Catalogue of the same_, 1802, fol. _A\r\n     Catalogue of the Harleian Manuscripts, &c._, Lond., 1759,\r\n     fol., 2 vols. _A Catalogue of the same_, Lond., 1808, fol.,\r\n     3 vols. _A Catalogue of the MSS. of the Kings Library, &c._,\r\n     1734, 4to. _A Catalogue of the MSS., &c., hitherto\r\n     undescribed_, Lond., 1782, 4to., two vols. _Catalog. Libror.\r\n     Impress., &c._, Lond., 1787, folio, 2 vols. These are the\r\n     published catalogues of the literary treasures, in\r\n     manuscript and in print, which are contained in the British\r\n     Museum. The _first Cottonian_ catalogue has a life of Sir\r\n     Robert Cotton, and an account of his library prefixed to it.\r\n     The _second_, by Samuel Hooper, was intended \"to remedy the\r\n     many defects\" in the preceding catalogue, and \"the\r\n     injudicious manner\" in which it was compiled; but it is of\r\n     itself sufficiently confused and imperfect. The _third_,\r\n     which is the most copious and valuable, with an index (and\r\n     which has an abridged account of Sir Robert Cotton, and of\r\n     his Library), was drawn up by Mr. Planta, the principal\r\n     librarian of the British Museum. A great part of the first\r\n     catalogue of the _Harleian MSS._ was compiled by the\r\n     celebrated Humphrey Wanley, and a most valuable and ably\r\n     executed publication it is! The _Second_ is executed by the\r\n     Rev. R. Nares: it contains the preface of the first, with an\r\n     additional one by himself, and a copious index; rendering\r\n     this the most complete catalogue of MSS. which has ever yet\r\n     appeared in our own country; although one regrets that its\r\n     typographical execution should not have kept pace with its\r\n     intrinsic utility. The two latter catalogues of MSS. above\r\n     described give an account of those which were presented by\r\n     royal munificence, and collected chiefly by Sir Hans Sloane\r\n     and Dr. Birch. The catalogue of 1734 (which is now rare) was\r\n     compiled by David Casley: that of 1782, by Samuel Ascough.\r\n     Of the catalogue of _Printed Books_, it would be unfair to\r\n     dwell upon its imperfections, since a new, and greatly\r\n     enlarged and improved, impression of it is about going to\r\n     press, under the editorial care and inspection of Messrs. H.\r\n     Ellis and Baber, the gentlemen to whom the printed books are\r\n     at present intrusted. Mr. Douce, who has succeeded Mr. Nares\r\n     as head librarian of the MSS., is busily employed in\r\n     examining the multifarious collection of the _Lansdowne\r\n     MSS._ (recently purchased by the Trustees of the Museum),\r\n     and we may hope that the day is not very far distant when\r\n     the public are to be congratulated on his minute and\r\n     masterly analysis of these treasures.----PARIS. _Catalogue\r\n     de la Bibliothéque de M. Paris de Meyzieux_, Paris, 1779,\r\n     8vo. _Bibliotheca elegantissima Parisina, par M. Lourent_,\r\n     1790, 8vo. _The same_: Lond., 1791, 8vo. Since the days of\r\n     Gaignat and the Duke de la Valliere, the longing eyes of\r\n     bibliographers were never blessed with a sight of more\r\n     splendid and choice books than were those in the possession\r\n     of M. PARIS DE MEYZIEUX. The Spira Virgil of 1470, UPON\r\n     VELLUM, will alone confer celebrity upon the _first_\r\n     catalogue--but what shall we say to the _second_? It\r\n     consists of only 635 articles, and yet, as is well observed\r\n     in the preface, it was never equalled for the like number.\r\n     Happy is that noviciate in bibliography who can forget the\r\n     tedium of a rainy day in sitting by the side of a log-wood\r\n     fire, and in regaling his luxurious fancy, by perusing the\r\n     account of \"fine, magnificent, matchless, large paper,\" and\r\n     \"vellum\" copies which are thickly studded from one end of\r\n     this volume to the other. Happier far the veteran, who can\r\n     remember how he braved the _perils of the sale_, in\r\n     encountering the noble and heavy metalled competitors who\r\n     flocked, from all parts of the realm, to partake of these\r\n     _Parisian_ spoils! Such a one casts an eye upon his\r\n     well-loaded shelves, and while he sees here and there a\r\n     yellow morocco Aldus, or a Russian leather Froben, he\r\n     remembers how bravely he fought for each, and with what\r\n     success his exertions were crowned! For my own part, gentle\r\n     reader, I frankly assure thee that--after having seen the\r\n     \"HEURES DE NOTRE DAME,\" written by the famous Jarry, and\r\n     decorated with SEVEN small exquisite paintings of the Virgin\r\n     and Christ--and the _Aldine Petrarch_ and _Virgil_ of 1501,\r\n     all of them executed upon SNOW-WHITE VELLUM--after having\r\n     seen only these books out of the Paris collection, I hope to\r\n     descend to my obscure grave in perfect peace and\r\n     satisfaction! The reader may smile; but let him turn to\r\n     nos. 14, 201, 328, of the _Bibl. Paris_: no. 318 of\r\n     the _Cat. de la Valliere_; and _Curiositès\r\n     Bibliographiques_, p. 67. This strain of \"ètourderie\r\n     bibliographique,\" ought not to make me forget to observe\r\n     that we are indebted to the enterprising spirit and correct\r\n     taste of Mr. Edwards for these, as well as for many other,\r\n     beautiful books imported from the Continent. Nor is it yet\r\n     forgotten that some thorough-bred bibliomaniacs, in their\r\n     way to the sale, used to call for a glass of ice, to allay\r\n     the contagious inflammation which might rage in the\r\n     auction-room. And now take we leave of Monsieur Paris de\r\n     Meyzieux. Peace to the ashes of so renowned a\r\n     book-chevalier.----PETAU ET MANSART. _Bibliotheca Potavina\r\n     et Mansartiana; ou Catalogue des Bibliothéques de Messrs.\r\n     Alexander Petau, et François Mansart; auxquells on a ajouté\r\n     le Cabinet des MSS. de Justus Lipsius._ Haye, 1722, 8vo. A\r\n     catalogue not very common, and well worth the\r\n     bibliographer's consultation.----PINELLI. _Bibliotheca\r\n     Maphæi Pinelli Veneti, &c. A Jacobo Morellio._ Venetiis,\r\n     1787, 6 vols., 8vo. _Bibliotheca Pinelliana: a catalogue of\r\n     the magnificent and celebrated library of Maffæi Pinelli,\r\n     late of Venice_, &c., London, 1789, 8vo. There can be no\r\n     question about the priority, in point both of typographical\r\n     beauty and intrinsic excellence, of these catalogues; the\r\n     latter being only a common sale one, with the abridgment of\r\n     the learned preface of Morelli, and of his bibliographical\r\n     notices. This immense collection (of the ancient owners of\r\n     which we have a short sketch in Morhof, vol. i., pp. 28,\r\n     202) was purchased by Messrs. Edwards and Robson: the Greek\r\n     and Latin books were sold for 6786_l._, the Italian, for\r\n     2570_l._--which barely repaid the expenses of purchase,\r\n     including duties, carriage, and sale. Although, as Dr.\r\n     Harwood has observed, \"there being no dust in Venice, this\r\n     most magnificent library has in general lain reposited for\r\n     some centuries, in excellent preservation,\"--yet the copies\r\n     were not, upon the whole, in the choicest condition. There\r\n     are copies of the catalogue of 1789 upon LARGE PAPER. The\r\n     catalogue of 1787 (with an elegant portrait of Pinelli\r\n     prefixed) has, at first sight, the aspect of a work printed\r\n     in small quarto.----POMPADOUR. _Catalogue des Livres de la\r\n     Bibliothéque de feue Madame La Marquise de Pompadour, Dame\r\n     du Palais de la Reine_, Paris, 1765, 8vo. The name of Madame\r\n     de Pompadour will be always respected by bibliographers, on\r\n     account of the taste and judgment which are displayed in\r\n     this elegant collection. The old popular romances form the\r\n     leading feature; but there is an ample sprinkling of the\r\n     belles-lettres and poetry. An animated eulogium is\r\n     pronounced upon Mad. de Pompadour by Jardé, in his \"Précis\r\n     sur les Bibliothéques;\" prefixed to the last edition of\r\n     Fournier's _Dictionnaire Portatif de Bibliographie_, p.\r\n     vij.----PRÉFOND. _Catalogue des Livres du Cabinet de M.D.P.\r\n     (Girardot de Préfond) Par Guillaume F. De Bure_, Paris,\r\n     1757, 8vo. An excellent collection; not wanting in rare and\r\n     magnificent productions. The owner of it was distinguished\r\n     for many solid, as well as splendid, qualifications. Only\r\n     six copies of it were printed upon LARGE PAPER. See _Cat. de\r\n     Gaignat_, vol. ii., no. 3467.----RANDON DE BOISSET.\r\n     _Catalogue des livres du cabinet de feu M. Randon du\r\n     Boisset. Par Guil. de Bure, fils aîné_, Paris, 1777, 12mo.\r\n     Although the generality of catalogue collectors will be\r\n     satisfied with the usual copy of this well-digested volume,\r\n     yet I apprehend the curious will not put up with any thing\r\n     short of a copy of it upon strong WRITING PAPER. Such a one\r\n     was in the Gouttard collection. See _Cat. de Gouttard_,\r\n     no. 1546.----_Reimannus._ _J.F. Reimanni Catalogus\r\n     Bibliothecæ Theologicæ Systematico-Criticus._ Hildes. 1731,\r\n     8vo., two vols. _Ejusdem accessiones uberiores ad Catalogum\r\n     Systematico-Criticum, editæ a Jo. W. Reimannus_, Brunsv.,\r\n     1747, 8vo. I have before given the character of this work in\r\n     the introductory part of my \"Knowledge of the Greek and\r\n     Latin Classics.\" Every thing commendatory of it may be here\r\n     repeated.----RENATI. _Bibliothecæ Josephi Renati Imperialis,\r\n     &c., Cardinalis Catalogus, &c._ Romæ, 1711, fol. This\r\n     excellent catalogue, which cost the compiler of it,\r\n     Fontanini, nine years of hard labour, is a most useful and\r\n     valuable one; serving as a model for catalogues of large\r\n     libraries. See the more minute criticism upon it in _Cat. de\r\n     Santander_, no. 6315. My copy, which wants the\r\n     title-page, but luckily contains the Latin preface, was\r\n     formerly Ruddiman's. The volume has 738 pages: this is\r\n     noticed because all the appendixes and addenda are\r\n     comprehended in the same.----REVICKZKY. _Bibliotheca Græca\r\n     et Latina, complectens auctores fere omnes Græcia et Latii\r\n     veteris, &c., cum delectu editionum tam primariarum, &c.,\r\n     quam etiam optimarum, splendidissimarum, &c., quas usui meo\r\n     paravi._ PERIERGUS DELTOPHILUS (the feigned name for\r\n     REVICKZKY), Berolini, 1784: 1794, 8vo. It was the delight of\r\n     Count Revickzky, the original owner of this collection, to\r\n     devote his time and attention to the acquisition of scarce,\r\n     beautiful, and valuable books; and he obtained such fame in\r\n     this department of literature as to cause him to be ranked\r\n     with the Vallieres, Pinellis, and Loménies of the day. He\r\n     compiled, and privately disposed of, the catalogue of his\r\n     collection, which bears the above title; and to some few of\r\n     which are prefixed a letter to M. L' A.D. [enini] (Member of\r\n     the French Academy) and a preface. _Three Supplements_ to\r\n     this catalogue were also, from time to time, circulated by\r\n     him; so that the purchaser must look sharply after these\r\n     acquisitions to his copy--as some one or the other of them\r\n     are generally missing. Peignot supposes there are only _two_\r\n     supplements. _Bibl. Curieuse_, p. 58. When Count Revickzky\r\n     came over to England, he made an offer to Earl Spencer to\r\n     dispose of the whole collection to his lordship, for a\r\n     certain \"round sum\" to be paid immediately into his hands,\r\n     and to receive, in addition, a yearly sum by way of annuity.\r\n     So speaks fame. Shortly after this contract was closed, the\r\n     Count died; and Earl Spencer, in consequence, for a\r\n     comparatively small sum (the result of an immediate and\r\n     generous compliance with the Count's wishes!), came into the\r\n     possession of a library which, united with his previous\r\n     magnificent collection, and the successful ardour with which\r\n     he has since continued the pursuit, places him quite at the\r\n     head of all the collectors in Europe--for early, rare,\r\n     precious, and beautiful, books. Long may he possess such\r\n     treasures!--and fleeing from the turbulence of politics, and\r\n     secluded as he is, both in the metropolis and at Althorp,\r\n     from the stunning noise of a city, may he always exclaim,\r\n     with Horace, as the Count did before him--\r\n\r\n          Sit mihi, quod nunc est, etiam minus; ut mihi vivam\r\n          Quod superest ævi, si quid superesse volunt Dí.\r\n          Sit bona librorum et provisæ frugis in annum\r\n          Copia, ne fluitem dubiæ spe pendulus horæ.\r\n\r\n          _Epist. Lib._ i.: _Epist._ xviii. v., 107.\r\n\r\n     Sir M.M. Sykes, Bart., has a copy of the edition of 1784\r\n     [which is in every respect the better one], printed upon\r\n     FINE VELLUM PAPER. A similar copy of the edition of 1794 is\r\n     noticed in the _Cat. de Caillard_,(1808) no. 2572. At the\r\n     sale of M. Meon's books, in 1804, a copy of the first\r\n     edition, charged with MS. notes of the celebrated Mercier\r\n     St. Leger, was sold for 30 livres.----RIVE. _Catalogue de la\r\n     Bibliothéque de l'Abbé Rive, par Archard_, Marseille, 1793,\r\n     8vo. A catalogue of the books of so sharp-sighted a\r\n     bibliographer as was the Abbé Rive cannot fail to be\r\n     interesting to the collector.----DU ROI [Louis XV.]\r\n     _Catalogus Codicum Manuscriptorum Bibliothecæ Regiæ (studio\r\n     et labore Anicetti Mellot). Paris, e Typog. Reg._, 1739,\r\n     folio, four vols.----DU ROI. _Des Livres imprimés de la même\r\n     Bibliothéque Royale. (Disposè par Messrs. les Abbés Sallier\r\n     et Boudot, &c.) Paris, De L'Imprim. Royale_, 1739-53, folio,\r\n     six vols. The most beautiful and carefully executed\r\n     catalogue in the world: reflecting a truly solid lustre upon\r\n     the literary reputation of France! The first four volumes,\r\n     written in Latin, comprehend an account of MSS.: the six\r\n     last, written in French, of printed works in THEOLOGY,\r\n     JURISPRUDENCE, and BELLES-LETTRES; the departments of\r\n     HISTORY and the ARTS AND SCIENCES still remaining to be\r\n     executed. De Bure told us, half a century ago, that the\r\n     \"Gens de Lettres\" were working hard at the completion of it;\r\n     but the then complaints of bibliographers at its imperfect\r\n     state are even yet continued in Fournier's last edition of\r\n     his _Dictionnaire Portatif de Bibliographie_, p. 468. So\r\n     easy it is to talk; so difficult to execute! I believe,\r\n     however, that M. Van-Praet, one of the principal librarians,\r\n     is now putting all engines to work to do away the further\r\n     disgrace of such unaccountably protracted negligence. My\r\n     copy of this magnificent set of books is bound in red\r\n     Morocco, gilt leaves, and was a presentation one from the\r\n     King \"au Comte de Neny, comme une marque de son estime,\r\n     1770.\" I should add that the first volume of \"Theology\"\r\n     contains a history of the rise and progress of the royal\r\n     library, which was reprinted in 8vo., 1782.----DU ROI.\r\n     _Notices et Extraits des Manuscrits de la Bibliothéque du\r\n     Roi, Paris. De l'Imprim. Roy._ 1787, 4to., seven vols. It\r\n     will be obvious to the candid reader that this work could\r\n     not be better introduced than in the present place; and a\r\n     most interesting and valuable one it is! My copy of it,\r\n     which is only in six volumes [but a seventh is mentioned in\r\n     _Cat. de Boutourlin_, no. 3845, and in Caillot's _Roman\r\n     Bibliographique_, p. 195], was purchased by me of Mr. Evans\r\n     of Pall-Mall, who had shewn it to several lovers of\r\n     bibliography, but none of whom had courage or curiosity\r\n     enough to become master of the volumes. How I have profited\r\n     by them, the Supplement to my first volume of the\r\n     \"Typographical Antiquities of Great Britain,\" may in part\r\n     shew. The public shall be made acquainted with still more\r\n     curious excerpts. In my humble judgment the present work is\r\n     a model of extraction of the marrow of old MSS. It may be\r\n     worth adding, the plates in the sixth volume are singular,\r\n     curious and beautiful.----DU ROI. _Accounts and Extracts of\r\n     the Manuscripts in the Library of the King of France.\r\n     Translated from the French_, London, 1789, 8vo., two vols.\r\n     \"The French Monarch [Louis XVI.], in the publication now\r\n     before us, has set an example to all Europe, well worthy to\r\n     be followed\"--says the opening of the translator's preface.\r\n     The present volumes contain a translation of only twenty-two\r\n     articles from the preceding work; and very strongly may they\r\n     be recommended to the curious philologist, as well as to the\r\n     thorough-bred bibliomaniac.----RÖVER. _Bibliotheca\r\n     Röveriana, sive Catalogus Librorum qui studiis inservierunt\r\n     Matthiæ Röveri._ Lug.

From the\r\n     elegant and pleasing Latin preface to this most carefully\r\n     compiled catalogue, we learn that the owner of the books\r\n     lived to his 82d year--and [what must be a peculiar\r\n     gratification to Bibliomaniacs] that he beat Pomponius\r\n     Atticus in the length of time during which he never had\r\n     occasion to take physic; namely, 50 years! Röver's life\r\n     seemed to glide away in rational tranquillity, and in total\r\n     seclusion from the world; except that he professed and\r\n     always shewed the greatest kindness to his numerous, and\r\n     many of them helpless, relatives--\"vix in publicum prodiit,\r\n     nisi cultus Divini externi aut propinquorum caussâ,\" p. xv.\r\n     His piety was unshaken. Like the venerable Jacob Bryant, his\r\n     death was hastened in consequence of a contusion in his leg\r\n     from a fall in endeavouring to reach a book.----ROTHELIN.\r\n     _Catalogue des livres de feu M'L. Abbé D'Orleans de\r\n     Rothelin. Par G. Martin_, Paris, 1746, 8vo. This catalogue\r\n     of the library of the amiable and learned Abbé Rothelin,\r\n     \"known (says Camus) for his fine taste for beautiful books,\"\r\n     is judiciously drawn up by Martin, who was the De Bure of\r\n     his day. A portrait of its owner faces the title-page. It\r\n     was the Abbé Rothelin who presented De Boze with the\r\n     celebrated '_Guirlande de Julie_'--a work which afterwards\r\n     came into the Valliere collection, and was sold for 14,510\r\n     livres,--\"the highest price (says Peignot) ever given for a\r\n     modern book.\" Consult his _Curiosités Bibliographiques_, pp.\r\n     62, 67; and _Bibl. Curieuse_, p. 61.----SARRAZ. _Bibliotheca\r\n     Sarraziana._ Hag. Com., 1715, 8vo. This catalogue, which is\r\n     frequently referred to by bibliographers, should not escape\r\n     the collector when he can obtain it for a few shillings. A\r\n     tolerably good preface or diatribe is prefixed, upon the\r\n     causes of the rarity of Books, but the volume itself is not\r\n     deserving of all the fine things in commendation of it which\r\n     are said in the _Bibl. Reiman_, pt. ii., p. 671,\r\n     &c.----SARTORI. _Catalogus Bibliographicus Librorum\r\n     Latinorum et Germanicorum in Bibliotheca Cæsar. reg. et\r\n     equestris Academiæ Theresianæ extantium, cum accessionibus\r\n     originum typographicarum.

Vol. i., ii., iii. Of this\r\n     very curious and greatly-to-be-desired catalogue, which is\r\n     to be completed in eight volumes, it is said that only ONE\r\n     HUNDRED copies are struck off. Peignot has a long and\r\n     interesting notice of it in his _Bibliographie Curieuse_, p.\r\n     64.----SCHALBRUCK. _Bibliotheca Schalbruchiana; sive\r\n     Catalogus exquisitissimorum rarissimorumque librorum, quos\r\n     collegit Joh. Theod. Schalbruch._ Amst. 1723, 8vo. A very\r\n     fine collection of rare and curious books. From a priced\r\n     copy of the catalogue, accidentally seen, I find that some\r\n     of them produced rather large sums.----SCHWARTZ. _Catalogus\r\n     Librorum continens codd. MSS. et libros sæculo_ xv.\r\n     _impressos, quos possedit et notis recensuit A.G.\r\n     Schwarzius_, Altorf. 1769, 8vo. The name of Schwartz is so\r\n     respectable in the annals of bibliography that one cannot\r\n     help giving the present catalogue a place in one's\r\n     collection. According to _Bibl. Solger._, vol. iii., no.\r\n     1459, a first part (there said to be printed upon LARGE\r\n     PAPER) was published in 1753. Schwartz's treatise, \"_De\r\n     Orig. Typog. Document. Primar._\" Altorf, 1740, 4to., should\r\n     have been noticed at p. 41, ante.----SCRIVERIUS.\r\n     _Bibliothecæ Scriverianæ Catalogus_, Amst., 1663,\r\n     4to.--\"exquisitissimus est: constat enim selectissimus\r\n     omnium facultatum et artium autoribus.\" This is the strong\r\n     recommendatory language of Morhof: _Polyhist. Literar._,\r\n     vol. i., 212.----SERNA SANTANDER. _Catalogue des livres de\r\n     la Bibliothéque de M.C. De La Serna Santander; redigé et mis\r\n     en ordre par lui même; avec des notes bibliographiques et\r\n     littèraires_, &c. Bruxelles, 1803, 8vo., five volumes. An\r\n     extensive collection of interesting works; with a\r\n     sufficiently copious index at the end of the fourth volume.\r\n     The fifth volume contains a curious disquisition upon the\r\n     antiquity of signatures, catchwords, and numerals; and is\r\n     enriched with a number of plates of watermarks of the paper\r\n     in ancient books. This catalogue, which is rarely seen in\r\n     our own country, is well worth a place in any library. It is\r\n     a pity the typographical execution of it is so very\r\n     indifferent. For the credit of a bibliographical taste, I\r\n     hope there were a few copies struck off upon LARGE\r\n     PAPER.----SION COLLEGE. _Catalogus universalis librorum\r\n     omnium in Bibliotheca Collegii Sionii apud Londinenses_;\r\n     Londini, 1650, 4to. _Ejusdem Collegii librorum Catalogus,\r\n     &c., Cura Reading_, Lond., 1724, fol. As the first of these\r\n     catalogues (of a collection which contains some very curious\r\n     and generally unknown volumes) was published before the\r\n     great fire of London happened, there will be found some\r\n     books in it which were afterwards consumed, and therefore\r\n     not described in the subsequent impression of 1724. This\r\n     latter, which Tom Osborne, the bookseller, would have called\r\n     a \"pompous volume,\" is absolutely requisite to the\r\n     bibliographer: but both impressions should be procured, if\r\n     possible. The folio edition is common and cheap.----SMITH\r\n     [CONSUL]. _Bibliotheca Smithiana, seu Catalogus Librorum\r\n     D.J. Smithii Angli, per cognomina Authorum dispositus._\r\n     Venetiis, 1755, 4to. _A Catalogue of the curious, elegant,\r\n     and very valuable library of Joseph Smith, Esq., His\r\n     Britannic Majesty's Consul at Venice, lately deceased_,\r\n     1773, 8vo. These are the catalogues of the collections of\r\n     books occasionally formed at Venice, by Mr. Joseph Smith,\r\n     during his consulship there. The quarto impression contains\r\n     a description of the books which were purchased \"en masse\"\r\n     by his present majesty. It is singularly well executed by\r\n     Paschali, comprehending, by way of an appendix, the prefaces\r\n     to those volumes in the collection which were printed in the\r\n     fifteenth century. I possess a brochûre of 71 pages,\r\n     containing a catalogue of books printed in the fifteenth\r\n     century, which has Consul Smith's arms at the beginning,\r\n     and, at the end, this subscription, \"Pretiosissima hæc\r\n     librorum collectio, cujusvis magni principis Bibliotheca\r\n     dignissima, constat voluminibus ccxlviii.\" The title-page\r\n     has no date. I suspect it to be the same catalogue of books\r\n     which is noticed at p. 77, ante, and which probably the\r\n     Consul bought: forming the greater part of his own library\r\n     of early printed books. See too the _Bibliogr. Miscellany_,\r\n     vol. ii., 72. The collection of 1773 was sold by auction,\r\n     for Mr. Robson, by Messrs. Baker and Leigh--and a fine one\r\n     it was. Among these books, the Spira Virgil of 1470, printed\r\n     UPON VELLUM, was purchased for _only twenty-five guineas_!\r\n\r\n            Excidat ille dies ævo--ne postera credant\r\n          Sæcula--!\r\n\r\n     ----SOLGER. _Bibliotheca sive Supellex Librorum Impressorum,\r\n     &c., et Codicum Manuscriptorum, quos per plurimos annos\r\n     collegit, &c., Adamus Rudolphus Solger._ Norimb., 1760,\r\n     8vo., three parts or vols. I should almost call this\r\n     publication \"facile princeps Catalogorum\"--in its way. The\r\n     bibliographical notices are frequent and full; and saving\r\n     that the words \"rarus, rarior, et rarissimus,\" are sometimes\r\n     too profusely bestowed, nothing seems to be wanting to\r\n     render this a very first rate acquisition to the collector's\r\n     library. I am indebted to the bibliomanical spirit of honest\r\n     Mr. Manson, of Gerard-street, the bookseller, for this\r\n     really useful publication.----SOUBISE. _Catalogue des livres\r\n     imprimés et manuscrits, &c., de feu Monseigneur Le Prince de\r\n     Soubise (par feu Le Clerc)_, Paris, 1788, 8vo. A short\r\n     history of this collection will be the best inducement to\r\n     purchase the present catalogue, whenever it comes in the way\r\n     of the collector. The foundation of this splendid library\r\n     was that of the famous De Thou's [vide Art. THUANUS, post],\r\n     which was purchased by the Cardinal de Rohan, who added it\r\n     to his own grand collection--\"the fruit of a fine taste and\r\n     a fine fortune.\" It continued to be augmented and enriched\r\n     'till, and after, it came into the possession of the PRINCE\r\n     DE SOUBISE--the last nobleman of his name--who dying in\r\n     January, 1789, the entire collection was dispersed by public\r\n     auction: after it had been offered for the purchase of one\r\n     or two eminent London booksellers, who have repented, and\r\n     will repent to their dying day, their declining the offer.\r\n     This catalogue is most unostentatiously executed upon very\r\n     indifferent paper; and, while an excellent index enables us\r\n     to discover any work of which we may be in want, the\r\n     beautiful copies from this collection which are in the\r\n     Cracherode library in the British Museum, give\r\n     unquestionable proof of the splendour of the books. For the\r\n     credit of French bibliography, I hope there are some few\r\n     copies upon LARGE PAPER.----TELLIER. _Bibliotheca\r\n     Tellereana, sive Catalogus Librorum Bibliotheca Caroli\r\n     Mauritii Le Tellier, Archiepiscopi Ducis Remensis. Parisiis,\r\n     e Typographia Regia_, 1693, fol. A finely engraved portrait\r\n     of Tellier faces the title-page. This is a handsome volume,\r\n     containing a numerous and well-chosen collection of\r\n     books.----THUANUS. [DE THOU] _Bibliothecæ Thuanæ Catalogus_,\r\n     Parisiis, 1679, 8vo. \"Three particular reasons,\" says\r\n     Baillet, \"should induce us to get possession of this\r\n     catalogue; first, the immortal glory acquired by De Thou in\r\n     writing his history, and in forming the most perfect and\r\n     select library of his age: and secondly, the abundance and\r\n     excellence of the books herein specified; and, thirdly, the\r\n     great credit of the bibliographers Du Puys and Quesnel, by\r\n     whom the catalogue was compiled.\" _Jugemens des Savans_,\r\n     vol. ii., p. 144, &c. Morhof is equally lavish in\r\n     commendation of this collection. See his _Polyhist.\r\n     Literar._, vol. i., 36, 211. The Books of De Thou, whose\r\n     fame will live as long as a book shall be read, were\r\n     generally in beautiful condition, with his arms stamped upon\r\n     the exterior of the binding, which was usually of Morocco;\r\n     and, from some bibliographical work (I think it is\r\n     Santander's catalogue), I learn that this binding cost the\r\n     worthy president not less than 20,000 crowns. De Thou's copy\r\n     of the editio princeps of Homer is now in the British\r\n     Museum; having been presented to this national institution\r\n     by the Rev. Dr. Cyril Jackson, who has lately resigned the\r\n     deanery of Christ Church College, Oxford,--\"and who is now\r\n     wisely gone to enjoy the evening of life in repose,\r\n     sweetened by the remembrance of having spent the day in\r\n     useful and strenuous exertion.\" For an account of the\r\n     posterior fate of De Thou's library, consult the article\r\n     \"SOUBISE,\" ante. I should add that, according to the _Bibl.\r\n     Solgeriana_, vol. iii., p. 243, no. 1431, there are\r\n     copies of this catalogue upon LARGE PAPER.----UFFENBACH.\r\n     _Catalogus universalis Bibliothecæ Uffenbachinæ librorum tam\r\n     typis quam manu exaratorum._ Francof. ad Moen, 1729, 8vo.,\r\n     4 vols. This catalogue is no mean acquisition to the\r\n     bibliographer's library. It rarely occurs in a perfect and\r\n     clean condition.----VALLIERE (DUC DE LA). _Catalogue des\r\n     Livres provenans de la Bibliothéque de M.L.D.D.L.V._, (M. le\r\n     Duc de la Valliere) _disposé et mis en ordre par Guill.\r\n     Franc. De Bure le Jeune._ Paris, 1767, 8vo., 2 vols.--_Des\r\n     Livres de la même Bibliothéque._ Paris, 1772, 8vo.--_Des\r\n     Livres et Manuscrits de la même Bibliothéque_, Paris, 1783,\r\n     8vo., 3 vols.--_Des Livres de la même Bibliothéque_, Paris,\r\n     1783, 6 vols. 8vo. These twelve volumes of catalogues of\r\n     this nobleman's library impress us with a grand notion of\r\n     its extent and value--perhaps never exceeded by that of any\r\n     private collection! It would seem that the Duke de la\r\n     Valliere had two sales of part of his books (of which the\r\n     two first catalogues are notifications) during his\r\n     life-time: the two latter catalogues of sales having been\r\n     put forth after his decease. Of these latter (for the former\r\n     contain nothing remarkable in them, except that there are\r\n     copies of the first on LARGE PAPER, in 4to.), the impression\r\n     of 1783, which was compiled by Van Praet and De Bure, is the\r\n     most distinguished for its notices of MSS. and early printed\r\n     books: and in these departments it is truly precious, being\r\n     enriched with some of the choicest books in the Gaignat\r\n     Collection. Those printed UPON VELLUM alone would form a\r\n     little library! Of the impression of 1783, which has a\r\n     portrait of the owner prefixed, there were fifty copies\r\n     printed upon LARGE PAPER, in 4to., to harmonize with the\r\n     _Bibliographie Instructive_, and _Gaignat's Catalogue_. See\r\n     _Bibliographical Miscell._, vol. ii., 66. Twelve copies were\r\n     also printed in royal 8vo., upon fine stout VELLUM PAPER; of\r\n     which the Rt. Hon. T. Grenville has a beautiful uncut copy\r\n     in six volumes. See also _Cat. de Loménie_ [1797], no.\r\n     2666. The last publication of 1788 was put forth by Nyon\r\n     l'aîné; and although the bibliographical observations are\r\n     but few in comparison with those in the preceding catalogue,\r\n     and no index is subjoined, yet it is most carefully\r\n     executed; and presents us with such a copious collection of\r\n     French topography, and old French and Italian poetry and\r\n     romances, as never has been, and perhaps never will be,\r\n     equalled. It contains 26,537 articles. The Count D'Artois\r\n     purchased this collection \"en masse;\" and it is now\r\n     deposited in the \"bibliothéque de l'Arsenal.\" See _Dictionn.\r\n     Bibliographique_, vol. iv., p. 133. It was once offered for\r\n     purchase to a gentleman of this country--highly\r\n     distinguished for his love of Virtû. Mr. Grenville has also\r\n     a similar large paper copy of this latter edition, of the\r\n     date of 1784.----VIENNA. _Codices Manuscripti Theologici.\r\n     Bibl. Palat. Vindob. Latini aliarumque Occidentis\r\n     Linguarum_, vol. i. (in tribus partibus.) _Recens._, &c.,\r\n     _Michael Denis._ Vindob. 1793, folio. Some mention of this\r\n     work has been made at page 65, ante. It may be here\r\n     necessary to remark that, from the preface, it would appear\r\n     to contain a ninth additional book to Lambecius's well-known\r\n     Commentaries (vide, p. 41, ante) which Kollarius had left\r\n     unpublished at his death. The preface is well worth perusal,\r\n     as it evinces the great pains which Denis has taken; and the\r\n     noble, if not matchless, munificence of his patron--\"qui\r\n     præter augustam Bibliothecæ fabricam in ipsos libros\r\n     centenis plura Rhenensium expendit millia.\"--This catalogue\r\n     is confined to a description of Latin, with some few notices\r\n     of Oriental Manuscripts; as the preceding work of Lambecius\r\n     and Kollarius contained an account of the Greek MSS. These\r\n     three parts, forming one volume, are closed by an excellent\r\n     index. The second volume was published in 1801. Upon the\r\n     whole, it is a noble and highly useful publication; and\r\n     places its author in the foremost rank of\r\n     bibliographers.----VOLPI. _Catalogo della Libreria de\r\n     Volpi_, &c. _Opera di Don Gaetano Volpi._ Padova, 1756, 8vo.\r\n     The Crevenna library was enriched with a great number of\r\n     valuable books which came from the library of the celebrated\r\n     Vulpii; of which the present is a well-arranged and uncommon\r\n     catalogue. Annexed to it there is an account of the press of\r\n     the Comini, which belonged to the owners of this collection.\r\n     The reader may consult _Bibl. Crevenn._, vol. v., pp. 302-3;\r\n     and Dr. Clarke's _Bibliogr. Miscell._, vol. ii.,\r\n     72.----VOYAGE _de deux Français dans le nord de l'Europe, en\r\n     1790-92, (par M. de Fortia)_ Paris, 1796, 8vo., 5 vols. That\r\n     the collector of catalogues may not scold me for this\r\n     apparent deviation from the subject discussed in this note,\r\n     I must inform him, upon the authority of Peignot, that these\r\n     interesting volumes contain \"some account of the most\r\n     beautiful and curious books contained in the Libraries of\r\n     the North, and in those of Italy, Spain, Holland, &c.\"\r\n     _Curiosités Bibliographiques_, p. lviii.----DE WITT.\r\n     _Catalogus Bibliothecæ Joannis De Witt_, Dordraci, 1701,\r\n     12mo. The preface to this catalogue, (from which an extract\r\n     was given in the _first_ edition of my \"_Introduction to the\r\n     Editions of the Greek and Latin Classics_,\" 1802, 8vo.,)\r\n     gives us a pleasing account of an ardent and elegant young\r\n     man in the pursuit of every thing connected with Virtû. De\r\n     Witt seems to have been, in books and statues, &c., what his\r\n     great ancestor was in politics--\"paucis comparandus.\" A\r\n     catalogue of the library of a collector of the same name was\r\n     published at Brussels, in 1752, by De Vos. See _Cat. de\r\n     Santander_, vol. iv., no. 6334.----ZURICH. _Catalogus\r\n     librorum Bibliothecæ Tigurinæ._ Tiguri, 1744, 8vo., 4 vols.\r\n     Although the last, this is not the most despicable,\r\n     catalogue of collections here enumerated. A reading man, who\r\n     happens to winter in Switzerland, may know, upon throwing\r\n     his eyes over this catalogue, that he can have access to\r\n     good books at Zurich--the native place of many an\r\n     illustrious author! The following, which had escaped me, may\r\n     probably be thought worthy of forming an\r\n\r\n     APPENDIX TO THE PRECEDING NOTE.\r\n\r\n     BERN. _Cat. Codd. MSS. Bibl. Bernensis.

Of these catalogues of the curious and valuable MSS.\r\n     which were bequeathed to Corpus College (or Bennet College,\r\n     as it is sometimes called) by the immortal Archbishop\r\n     Parker, the first is the more elegantly printed, but the\r\n     latter is the more copious and correct impression.

If a lucid\r\n     order, minute and correct description of the volumes of an\r\n     admirably chosen library, accompanied with a copious and\r\n     faithful alphabetical index, be recommendations with the\r\n     bibliographer, the present volume will not be found wanting\r\n     upon his shelf. It is the most useful book of its kind ever\r\n     published in this country.

Speak--are you about to announce the sale of some bibliographical\r\nworks?\r\n\r\nPHIL. Even so. To morrow, if I mistake not, GONZALVO'S choice gems, in\r\nthis way, are to be disposed of.\r\n\r\nLIS. Consider them as my own. Nothing shall stay me from the\r\npossession of them.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. You speak precipitately. Are you accustomed to attend\r\nbook-auctions?\r\n\r\nLIS. No; but I will line my pockets with pistoles, and who dare oppose\r\nme?\r\n\r\nPHIL. And do you imagine that no one, but yourself, has his pockets\r\n\"lined with pistoles,\" on these occasions?\r\n\r\nLIS. It may be so--that other linings are much warmer than my\r\nown:--but, at any rate, I will make a glorious struggle, and die with\r\nmy sword in my hand.\r\n\r\nPHIL. This is _Book-Madness_ with a vengeance! However, we shall see\r\nthe issue. When and how do you propose going?\r\n\r\nLIS. A chaise shall be at this door by nine in the morning. Who will\r\naccompany me?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Our friend and Philemon will prevent your becoming absolutely\r\nraving, by joining you. I shall be curious to know the result.\r\n\r\nLIS. Never fear. _Bibliomania_ is, of all species of insanity, the\r\nmost rational and praise-worthy. I here solemnly renounce my former\r\nopinions, and wish my errors to be forgotten. I here crave pardon of\r\nthe disturbed manes of the Martins, De Bures, and Patersons, for that\r\nflagitious act of _Catalogue-Burning_; and fondly hope that the\r\nunsuspecting age of boyhood will atone for so rash a deed. Do you\r\nfrankly forgive--and will you henceforth consider me as a worth\r\n[Transcriber's Note: worthy] \"_Aspirant_\" in the noble cause of\r\nbibliography?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Most cordially do I forgive you; and freely admit you into the\r\nfraternity of Bibliomaniacs. Philemon, I trust, will be equally\r\nmerciful.\r\n\r\nPHIL. Assuredly, Lisardo, you have my entire forgiveness: and I exult\r\na little in the hope that you will prove yourself to be a sincere\r\nconvert to the cause, by losing no opportunity of enriching your\r\nbibliographical stores. Already I see you mounted, as a book\r\nchevalier, and hurrying from the country to London--from London again\r\nto the country--seeking adventures in which your prowess may be\r\ndisplayed--and yielding to no competitor who brandishes a lance of\r\nequal weight with your own!\r\n\r\nLIS. 'Tis well. At to-morrow's dawn my esquire shall begin to burnish\r\nup my armour--and caparison my courser. Till then adieu!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere the conversation, in a connected form, ceased; and it was\r\nresolved that Philemon and myself should accompany Lisardo on the\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FARI QUÆ SENTIAT]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\n=The Auction Room.=\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF ORLANDO.\r\n\r\nOF ANCIENT PRICES OF BOOKS, AND BOOK-BINDING.\r\n\r\nBOOK-AUCTION BIBLIOMANIACS.\r\n\r\n     \"As to the late method used in selling books by AUCTION in\r\n     London, I suppose that many have paid dear for their\r\n     experience in this way--it being apparent that most books\r\n     bought in an auction may be had cheaper in booksellers'\r\n     shops.\"\r\n\r\n     CLAVEL: _Cat. of Books for 1680, Pref._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n=The Auction Room.=\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF ORLANDO.\r\nOF ANCIENT PRICES OF BOOKS, AND BOOK-BINDING.\r\nBOOK AUCTION BIBLIOMANIACS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNever, surely, did two mortals set off upon any expedition with\r\ngreater glee and alacrity than did Lisardo and Philemon for the sale,\r\nby auction, of GONZALVO'S bibliographical library. The great pains\r\nwhich Lysander had taken in enumerating the various foreign and\r\ndomestic writers upon Bibliography, with his occasionally animated\r\neulogies upon some favourite author had quite inflamed the sanguine\r\nmind of Lisardo; who had already, in anticipation, fancied himself in\r\npossession of every book which he had heard described. Like Homer's\r\nhigh-bred courser, who\r\n\r\n     --ere he starts, a thousand steps are lost--\r\n\r\nour young bibliomaniac began to count up his volumes, arrange his\r\nshelves, bespeak his binder, and revel in the luxury of a splendid\r\nand nearly matchless collection. The distance from my house to the\r\nscene of action being thirteen miles, Lisardo, during the first six,\r\nhad pretty nearly exhausted himself in describing the delightful\r\npictures which his ardent fancy had formed; and finding the\r\nconversation beginning to flag, Philemon, with his usual good-nature\r\nand judgment, promised to make a pleasing digression from the dry\r\nsubject of book-catalogues, by an episode with which the reader shall\r\nbe presently gratified. Having promised to assist them both, when we\r\narrived at Messrs. L. and S., in the Strand, with some information\r\nrelating to the prices of such books as they stood in need of, and to\r\nthe various book-collectors who attended public sales, Lisardo\r\nexpressed himself highly obliged by the promise; and, sinking quietly\r\ninto a corner of the chaise, he declared that he was now in a most apt\r\nmood to listen attentively to Philemon's digressive chat: who\r\naccordingly thus began.\r\n\r\n\"Lord Coke,\"--exclaimed PHILEMON, in a mirthful strain--\"before he\r\nventured upon '_The Jurisdiction of the Courts of the Forest_,' wished\r\nto 'recreate himself' with Virgil's description of 'Dido's Doe of the\r\nForest;'[163] in order that he might 'proceed the more cheerfully'\r\nwith the task he had undertaken; and thus exchange somewhat of the\r\nprecise and technical language of the lawyer for that glowing tone of\r\ndescription which woodland scenes and hunting gaieties seldom fail to\r\nproduce. Even so, my good friends (pursued Philemon), I shall make a\r\nlittle digression from the confined subject to which our attentions\r\nhave been so long directed by taking you with me, in imagination, to\r\nthe delightful abode of ORLANDO.\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 163: The quaint language of Lord Coke is well\r\n     worth quotation: \"And seeing we are to treat of matters of\r\n     game, and hunting, let us (to the end we may proceed the\r\n     more chearfully) recreate ourselves with the excellent\r\n     description of Dido's Doe of the Forest wounded with a\r\n     deadly arrow sticken in her, and not impertinent to our\r\n     purpose:\r\n\r\n          Uritur infælix Dido, totaque vagatur\r\n          Urbe furens, &c.\r\n\r\n     And in another place, using again the word (Sylva) and\r\n     describing a forest saith:\r\n\r\n          Ibat in antiquam sylvam stabula alta ferarum.\"\r\n\r\n          _Institutes_, pt. iv., p. 289, ed. 1669.\r\n\r\n     Thus pleasantly could our sage expounder of the laws of the\r\n     realm illustrate the dry subject of which he treated!]\r\n\r\nLIS. I have heard of him: a very \"_Helluo Librorum_!\" Thus we only\r\nchange sides--from things to men; from books to book-collectors. Is\r\nthis digressive? Is this an episode?\r\n\r\nPHIL. Why this abrupt interruption? If I did not know you and myself,\r\ntoo, Lisardo, I should observe an obstinate silence during the\r\nremainder of the journey. An episode, though it suspend the main\r\naction for a while, partakes of the nature of the subject of the work.\r\nIt is an _appropriate_ digression. Do pray read Dr. Blair[164] upon\r\nthe subject--and now only listen.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 164: _Lecture_ XLII., vol. iii.]\r\n\r\nOrlando (continued Philemon) had from his boyhood loved books and\r\nbook-reading. His fortune was rather limited; but he made shift--after\r\nbringing up three children, whom he lost from the ages of nineteen to\r\ntwenty-four, and which have been recently followed to their graves by\r\nthe mother that gave them birth--he made shift, notwithstanding the\r\nexpenses of their college education, and keeping up the reputation of\r\na truly hospitable table, to collect, from year to year, a certain\r\nnumber of volumes, according to a certain sum of money appropriated\r\nfor the purchase of them; generally making himself master of the\r\nprincipal contents of the first year's purchase, before the ensuing\r\none was placed upon his shelves. He lives in a large ancestral house;\r\nand his library is most advantageously situated and delightfully\r\nfitted up. Disliking such a wintry residence as Thomson has\r\ndescribed[165]--although fond of solemn retirement, and of Cowper's\r\n\"boundless contiguity of shade,\"--he has suffered the rules of common\r\nsense always to mingle themselves in his plans of domestic comfort;\r\nand, from the bow-windowed extremity of his library, he sees realized,\r\nat the distance of four hundred yards, Cæsar's gently-flowing river\r\n_Arar_,[166] in a stream which loses itself behind some low shrubs;\r\nabove which is a softly-undulating hill, covered with hazel, and\r\nbirch, and oak. To the left is an open country, intersected with\r\nmeadows and corn fields, and terminated by the blue mountains of\r\nMalvern at the distance of thirteen miles. Yet more to the left, but\r\nwithin one hundred and fifty yards of the house, and forming something\r\nof a foreground to the landscape, are a few large and lofty elm trees,\r\nunder which many a swain has rested from his toil; many a tender vow\r\nhas been breathed; many a sabbath-afternoon[167] innocently kept; and\r\nmany a village-wake cordially celebrated! Some of these things yet\r\nbless the aged eyes of ORLANDO!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 165:\r\n\r\n          \"In the wild depth of Winter, while without\r\n          The ceaseless winds blow ice, be my retreat\r\n          Between the groaning forest and the shore,\r\n          Beat by the boundless multitude of waves,\r\n          A rural, sheltered, solitary scene!\"----\r\n\r\n          _Winter._\r\n\r\n     One would like a situation somewhat more _sheltered_, when\r\n     \"The ceaseless winds blow ice!\"]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 166: \"Flumen est _Arar_, quod per fines Æduorum et\r\n     Sequanorum in Rhodanum fluit, incredibili lenitate, ita ut\r\n     oculis, in utram partem fluat, judicari nos possit.\" _De\r\n     Bell. Gall._, lib. i., § x. Philemon might as happily have\r\n     compared Orlando's quiet stream to \"the silent river\"\r\n\r\n          ----quæ Liris quietâ\r\n          Mordet aquâ----\r\n\r\n     which Horace has so exquisitely described, in contrast with\r\n\r\n          ----obliquis laborat\r\n          Lympha fugax trepidare rivo.\r\n\r\n          _Carm._, _lib._ i., _Od._ xxxi., _lib._ ii., _Od._ ii.\r\n\r\n     Yet let us not forget Collin's lovely little bit of landscape--\r\n\r\n          \"Where slowly winds the stealing wave.\"]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 167: There is a curious proclamation by Q.\r\n     Elizabeth, relating to some Sabbath recreations or games,\r\n     inserted in Hearne's preface to his edition of _Camden's\r\n     Annals_, p. xxviii. It is a little too long to be given\r\n     entire; but the reader may here be informed that \"shooting\r\n     with the standard, shooting with the broad arrow, shooting\r\n     at the twelve score prick, shooting at the Turk, leaping for\r\n     men, running for men, wrestling, throwing the sledge, and\r\n     pitching the bar,\" were suffered to be exhibited, on several\r\n     Sundays, for the benefit of one \"John Seconton Powlter,\r\n     dwelling within the parish of St. Clements Danes, being a\r\n     poor man, having four small children, and fallen to decay.\"]\r\n\r\nI have slightly noticed the comfortable interior of his library.--\r\n\r\nLIS. You spoke of a bow-windowed extremity--\r\n\r\nPHIL. Yes, in this bow-window--the glass of which was furnished full\r\ntwo hundred and fifty years ago, and which has recently been put into\r\na sensible modern frame-work--thereby affording two hours longer light\r\nto the inhabitant--in this bow-window, you will see a great quantity\r\nof stained glass of the different arms of his own, and of his wife's,\r\nfamily; with other appropriate embellishments.[168] And when the\r\nevening sun-beams throw a chequered light throughout the room, 'tis\r\npleasant to observe how Orlando enjoys the opening of an Aldine Greek\r\nClassic--the ample-margined leaves of which receive a mellower tint\r\nfrom the soft lustre that pervades the library. Every book, whether\r\nopened or closed, is benefited by this due portion of light; so that\r\nthe eye, in wandering over the numerous shelves, is neither hurt by\r\nmorning glare nor evening gloom. Of colours, in his furniture, he is\r\nvery sparing: he considers white shelves, picked out with gold, as\r\nheretical--mahogany, wainscot, black, and red, are, what he calls,\r\northodox colours. He has a few busts and vases; and as his room is\r\nvery lofty, he admits above, in black and gold frames, a few portraits\r\nof eminent literary characters; and whenever he gets a genuine\r\nVandyke, or Velasquez, he congratulates himself exceedingly upon his\r\ngood fortune.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 168: The reader, who is partial to the\r\n     lucubrations of Thomas Hearne, may peruse a long gossipping\r\n     note of his upon the importance of _stained glass\r\n     windows_--in his account of Godstow nunnery. See his _Guil.\r\n     Neubrig._, vol. ii., 768.]\r\n\r\nLIS. All this bespeaks a pretty correct taste. But I wish to know\r\nsomething of the man.\r\n\r\nPHIL. You shall, presently; and, in hearing what I am about to relate,\r\nonly let us both strive, good Lisardo, so to regulate our studies and\r\nfeelings that our old age may be like unto Orlando's.\r\n\r\nLast year I went with my uncle to pay him our annual visit. He\r\nappeared quite altered and shaken from the recent misfortune of losing\r\nhis wife; who had survived the death of her children fifteen years;\r\nherself dying in the sixtieth of her own age. The eyes of Orlando were\r\nsunk deeply into his forehead, yet they retained their native\r\nbrilliancy and quickness. His cheeks were wan, and a good deal\r\nwithered. His step was cautious and infirm. When we were seated in his\r\ncomfortable library chairs, he extended his right arm towards me, and\r\nsqueezing my hand cordially within his own--\"Philemon,\" said he, \"you\r\nare not yet thirty, and have therefore sufficient ardour to enable you\r\nto gratify your favourite passion for books. Did you ever read the\r\ninscription over the outside of my library door--which I borrowed from\r\nLomeir's account of one over a library at Parma?[169]\" On my telling\r\nhim that it had escaped me--\"Go,\" said he, \"and not only read, but\r\nremember it.\"--The inscription was as follows:\r\n\r\n     INGREDERE MUSIS SACER, NAM\r\n     ET HIC DII HABITANT.\r\n     ITEM\r\n     NULLUS AMICUS MAGIS LIBET,\r\n     QUAM LIBER.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 169: _De Bibliothecis_: p. 269, edit. 1680.]\r\n\r\n\"Have a care,\" said he, on my resuming my seat--\"have a care that you\r\ndo not treat such a friend ill, or convert him into a foe. For myself,\r\nmy course is well nigh run. My children have long taken their leave of\r\nme, to go to the common parent who created, and to the Saviour who has\r\nvouchsafed to redeem, us all; and, though the usual order of nature\r\nhas been here inverted, I bow to the fate which Heaven has allotted me\r\nwith the unqualified resignation of a Christian. My wife has also\r\nrecently left me, for a better place; and I confess that I begin to\r\ngrow desolate, and anxious to take my departure to join my family. In\r\nmy solitude, dear Philemon, I have found these (pointing to his books)\r\nto be what Cicero, and Seneca, and our own countryman De Bury,[170]\r\nhave so eloquently and truly described them to be--our friends, our\r\ninstructors, and our comforts. Without any affectation of hard\r\nreading, great learning, or wonderful diligence, I think I may venture\r\nto say that I have read more valuable books than it falls to the lot\r\nof the generality of book-collectors to read; and I would fain believe\r\nthat I have profited by my studies. Although not of the profession of\r\nthe church, you know that I have always cherished a fondness for\r\nsacred literature; and there is hardly a good edition of the Greek\r\nTestament, or a commentator of repute upon the Bible, foreign or\r\ndomestic, but what you will find some reference to the same in my\r\ninterleaved copy of Bishop Wilson's edition of the Holy Scriptures. A\r\ngreat number of these commentators themselves are in my library, as\r\nwell as every authoritative edition of the Greek Testament, from the\r\nComplutensian to Griesbach's. Yet do not suppose that my theological\r\nbooks are equal in measure to one fourth part of those in the Imperial\r\nlibrary at Paris.[171] My object has always been instruction and\r\nimprovement; and when these could be obtained from any writer, whether\r\nRoman Catholic or Protestant, Arminian or Calvinistic, I have not\r\nfailed to thank him, and to respect him, too, if he has declared his\r\nopinions with becoming diffidence and moderation. You know that\r\nnothing so sorely grieves me as dogmatical arrogance, in a being who\r\nwill always be frail and capricious, let him think and act as he\r\nplease. On a Sunday evening I usually devote a few hours to my\r\ntheological studies--(if you will allow my sabbath-meditations to be\r\nso called) and, almost every summer evening in the week, saunter\r\n'midst yon thickets and meadows by the river side, with Collins, or\r\nThompson, or Cowper, in my hand. The beautiful sentiments and grand\r\nimagery of Walter Scott are left to my in-door avocations; because I\r\nlove to read the curious books to which he refers in his notes, and\r\nhave always admired, what I find few critics have noticed, how\r\nadroitly he has ingrafted fiction upon truth. As I thus perambulate,\r\nwith my book generally open, the villagers treat me as Sir Roger De\r\nCoverley made his tenants treat the Spectator--by keeping at a\r\nrespectful distance--but when I shut up my volume, and direct my steps\r\nhomewards, I am always sure to find myself, before I reach my\r\nthreshold, in company with at least half a dozen gossipping and\r\nwell-meaning rustics. In other departments of reading, history and\r\npoetry are my delight. On a rainy or snowy day, when all looks sad and\r\ndismal without, my worthy friend and neighbour, PHORMIO, sometimes\r\ngives me a call--and we have a rare set-to at my old favourite\r\nvolumes--the '_Lectiones Memorabiles et Reconditæ_' of WOLFIUS[172]--a\r\ncommonplace book of as many curious, extraordinary, true and false\r\noccurrences, as ever were introduced into two ponderous folios. The\r\nnumber of strange cuts in it used to amuse my dear children--whose\r\nparent, from the remembrance of the past, still finds a pleasing\r\nrecreation in looking at them. So much, dear Philemon, for my\r\ndesultory mode of studying: improve upon it--but at all events, love\r\nyour books for the good which they may produce; provided you open them\r\nwith 'singleness of heart--' that is, a sincerity of feeling.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 170: Every school-lad who has written a copy under\r\n     a writing-master, or who has looked into the second book of\r\n     the _\"Selectæ è Profanis Scriptoribus,\" &c._, has probably\r\n     been made acquainted with the sentiments of the above\r\n     ancient heathen philosophers relating to Learning and Books;\r\n     but may not have been informed of the conciliatory manner in\r\n     which our countryman De Bury has invited us to approach the\r\n     latter. \"Hi sunt magistri (says he) qui nos instruunt sine\r\n     vergis et ferula, sine verbis et colera, sine pane et\r\n     pecunia. Si accedis, non dormiunt; si inquiris, non se\r\n     abscondunt; non remurmurant, si oberres; cachinnos nesciunt,\r\n     si ignores.\" These original and apt words are placed in the\r\n     title-page to the first volume of _Dr. Clarke's\r\n     Bibliographical Dictionary_.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 171: \"Il y a 300 pieds cubes de livres de\r\n     théologie,\"--\"qui tapissent les murs des deux premières\r\n     salles de la Bibliothéque Impériale.\" Caillot: _Roman\r\n     Bibliographique_, tom. i., 72, edit. 1809.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 172: There are few men, of any literary curiosity,\r\n     who would not wish to know something of the work here\r\n     noticed; and much more than appears to be known of its\r\n     illustrious author; concerning whom we will first discourse\r\n     a little: \"JOHANNES WOLFIUS (says Melchoir [Transcriber's\r\n     Note: Melchior] Adam), the laborious compiler of the\r\n     _Lectionum Memorabilium et Reconditarum Centenarii_ xvi.\r\n     (being a collection of curious pieces from more than 3000\r\n     authors--chiefly Protestant) was a civilian, a soldier, and\r\n     a statesman. He was born A.D. 1537, at Vernac, in the duchy\r\n     of Deux Ponts; of which town his father was chief\r\n     magistrate. He was bred under Sturmius at Strasbourg, under\r\n     Melancthon at Wittemberg, and under Cujas at Bruges. He\r\n     travelled much and often; particularly into France and\r\n     Burgundy, with the Dukes of Stettin, in 1467. He attended\r\n     the Elector Palatine, who came with an army to the\r\n     assistance of the French Hugonots in 1569; and, in 1571, he\r\n     conducted the corpse of his master back to Germany by sea.\r\n     After this, he was frequently employed in embassies from the\r\n     electors Palatine to England and Poland. His last patrons\r\n     were the Marquisses of Baden, who made him governor of\r\n     Mündelsheim, and gave him several beneficial grants. In\r\n     1594, Wolfius bade adieu to business and courts, and retired\r\n     to Hailbrun; where he completed his \"_Lectiones_,\" which had\r\n     been the great employment of his life. He died May 23, A.D.\r\n     1600--the same year in which the above volumes were\r\n     published.\" Thus far, in part, our biographer, in his _Vitæ\r\n     Eruditorum cum Germanorum tum Exterorum_: pt. iii., p. 156,\r\n     edit. 1706. These particulars may be gleaned from Wolfius's\r\n     preface; where he speaks of his literary and diplomatic\r\n     labours with great interest and propriety. In this preface\r\n     also is related a curious story of a young man of the name\r\n     of Martin, whom Wolfius employed as an amanuensis to\r\n     transcribe from his \"three thousand authors\"--and who was at\r\n     first so zealously attached to the principles of the Romish\r\n     Church that he declared \"he wished for no heaven where\r\n     Luther might be.\" The young man died a Protestant; quite\r\n     reconciled to a premature end, and in perfect good will with\r\n     Luther and his doctrine. As to Wolfius, it is impossible to\r\n     read his preface, or to cast a glance upon his works--\"magno\r\n     et pene incredibili labore multisque vigiliis\r\n     elaboratum\"--(as Linsius has well said, in the opening of\r\n     the admonition to the reader, prefixed to his index) without\r\n     being delighted with his liberality of disposition, and\r\n     astonished at the immensity of his labour. Each volume has\r\n     upwards of 1000 pages closely printed upon an indifferent\r\n     brown-tinted paper; which serves nevertheless to set off the\r\n     several hundreds of well executed wood cuts which the work\r\n     contains. Linsius's index, a thin folio, was published in\r\n     the year 1608: this is absolutely necessary for the\r\n     completion of a copy. As bibliographers have given but a\r\n     scanty account of this uncommon work (mentioned, however,\r\n     very properly by Mr. Nicol in his interesting preface to the\r\n     catalogue of the Duke of Roxburgh's books; and of which I\r\n     observe in the _Bibl. Solgeriana_, vol. i., no. 1759,\r\n     that a second edition, printed in 1672, is held in\r\n     comparatively little estimation), so biographers (if we\r\n     except Melchior Adam, the great favourite of Bayle) have\r\n     been equally silent respecting its author. Fabricius, and\r\n     the Historical Dictionary published at Caen, do not mention\r\n     him; and Moreri has but a meagre and superficial notice of\r\n     him. Wolfius's _Penus Artis Historicæ_, of which the best\r\n     edition is that of 1579, is well described in the tenth\r\n     volume of Fournier's _Methode pour étudier l'histoire_, p.\r\n     12, edit. 1772. My respect for so extraordinary a\r\n     bibliomaniac as WOLFIUS, who was groping amongst the books\r\n     of the public libraries belonging to the several great\r\n     cities which he visited, (in his diplomatic character--vide\r\n     præf.) whilst his masters and private secretary were\r\n     probably paying their devotions to Bacchus--induces me to\r\n     treat the reader with the following impression of his\r\n     portrait.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration]\r\n\r\n     This cut is taken from a fac-simile drawing, made by me of\r\n     the head of Wolfius as it appears at the back of the\r\n     title-page to the preceding work. The original impression is\r\n     but an indifferent one; but it presents in addition, the\r\n     body of Wolfius as far as the waist; with his right hand\r\n     clasping a book, and his left the handle of a sword. His\r\n     ponderous chain has a medallion suspended at the end. This\r\n     print, which evidently belongs to the English series, has\r\n     escaped Granger. And yet I know not whether such\r\n     intelligence should be imparted!--as the scissars may hence\r\n     go to work to deprive many a copy of these \"_Lectiones_,\" of\r\n     their elaborately-ornamented title-pages. Forbid it, good\r\n     sense!]\r\n\r\n\"In a short time,\" continued the venerable Orlando, after a pause of\r\nfifteen seconds, \"in a short time I must bid adieu to this scene; to\r\nmy choice copies; beautiful bindings: and all the classical furniture\r\nwhich you behold around you. Yes!--as Reimannus[173] has well\r\nobserved,--'there is no end to accumulating books, whilst the\r\nboundaries of human existence are limited, indeed!' But I have made\r\nevery necessary, and, I hope, appropriate, regulation; the greater\r\npart of my library is bequeathed to one of the colleges in the\r\nUniversity of Oxford; with an injunction to put an inscription over\r\nthe collection very different from what the famous Ranzau[174]\r\ndirected to be inscribed over his own.--About three hundred volumes\r\nyou will find bequeathed to you, dear Philemon--accompanied with a few\r\nremarks not very different from what Lotichius[175] indited, with his\r\ndying breath, in his book-legacy to the learned Sambucus. I will, at\r\npresent, say no more. Come and see me whenever you have an\r\nopportunity.

VIII. and Elizabeth, paid in\r\nproportion for the volumes of _their_ Libraries?\r\n\r\nUpon Philemon's declaring himself unable to gratify his friend's\r\ncuriosity, but intimating that some assistance might probably be\r\nderived from myself, I took up the discourse by observing that--\r\n\r\n\"In the infancy of printing in this country (owing to the competition\r\nof foreigners) it would seem that our own printers (who were both\r\nbooksellers and book-binders) had suffered considerably in their\r\ntrade, by being obliged to carry their goods to a market where the\r\ngenerality of purchasers were pleased with more elegantly executed\r\nworks at an inferior price. The legislature felt, as every patriotic\r\nlegislature would feel, for their injured countrymen; and,\r\naccordingly, the statute of Richard III. was enacted,[176] whereby\r\nEnglish printers and book-binders were protected from the mischiefs,\r\nwhich would otherwise have overtaken them. Thus our old friend Caxton\r\nwent to work with greater glee, and mustered up all his energies to\r\nbring a good stock of British manufacture to the market. What he\r\nusually sold his books for, in his life time, I have not been able to\r\nascertain; but, on his decease, one of his _Golden Legends_ was\r\nvalued, in the churchwardens' books, at six shillings and eight\r\npence.[177] Whether this was a great or small sum I know not; but,\r\nfrom the same authority we find that twenty-two pounds were given,\r\ntwelve years before, for eleven huge folios, called '_Antiphoners_.'[178]\r\nIn the reign of Henry VIII. it would seem, from a memorandum in the\r\ncatalogue of the Fletewode library (if I can trust my memory with such\r\nminutiæ) that Law-Books were sold for about ten sheets to the\r\ngroat.[179] Now, in the present day, Law-Books--considering the\r\nwretched style in which they are published, with broken types upon\r\nmilk-and-water-tinted paper--are the dearest of all modern\r\npublications. Whether they were anciently sold for so comparatively\r\nextravagant a sum may remain to be proved. Certain it is that, before\r\nthe middle of the sixteenth century, you might have purchased\r\nGrafton's abridgment of Polydore Virgil's superficial work about _The\r\nInvention of Things_ for fourteen pence;[180] and the same printer's\r\nbook of _Common Prayer_ for four shillings. Yet if you wanted a\r\nsuperbly bound _Prymer_, it would have cost you (even five and twenty\r\nyears before) nearly half a guinea.[181] Nor could you have purchased\r\na decent _Ballad_ much under sixpence; and _Hall's Chronicle_ would\r\nhave drawn from your purse twelve shillings;[182] so that,\r\nconsidering the then value of specie, there is not much ground of\r\ncomplaint against the present prices of books.\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 176: By the 1st of Richard III. (1433, ch. ix.\r\n     sec. xii.) it appeared that, Whereas, a great number of the\r\n     king's subjeets [Transcriber's Note: subjects] within this\r\n     realm having \"given themselves diligently to learn and\r\n     exercise THE CRAFT OF PRINTING, and that at this day there\r\n     being within this realm a great number cunning and expert in\r\n     the said science or craft of printing, as able to exercise\r\n     the said craft in all points as any stranger, in any other\r\n     realm or country, and a great number of the king's subjects\r\n     living by the craft and mystery of BINDING OF BOOKS, and\r\n     well expert in the same;\"--yet \"all this notwithstanding,\r\n     there are divers persons that bring from beyond the sea\r\n     great plenty of printed books--not only in the Latin tongue,\r\n     but also in our maternal English tongue--some bound in\r\n     boards, some in leather, and some in parchment, and them\r\n     sell by retail, whereby many of the king's subjects, being\r\n     binders of books, and having no other faculty therewith to\r\n     get their living, be destitute of work, and like to be\r\n     undone, except some reformation herein be had,--Be it\r\n     therefore enacted, &c.\" By the 4th clause or provision, if\r\n     any of these printers or sellers of printed books vend them\r\n     \"at too high and unreasonable prices,\" then the Lord\r\n     Chancellor, Lord Treasurer, or any of the Chief Justices of\r\n     the one bench or the other--\"by the oaths of twelve honest\r\n     and discreet persons,\" were to regulate their prices.

I presume that the ancient method of\r\n_Book-Binding_[183] added much to the expense of the purchase. But be\r\nthis as it may, we know that Sir Ralph Sadler, at the close of the\r\nsixteenth century, had a pretty fair library, with a _Bible_ in the\r\nchapel to boot, for £10.[184] Towards the close of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, we find the Earl of Peterborough enlisting among the book\r\nchampions; and giving, at the sale of Richard Smith's books in 1682,\r\nnot less than eighteen shillings and two pence for the first English\r\nedition of his beloved _Godfrey of Boulogne_.[185] In Queen Ann's\r\ntime, Earl Pembroke and Lord Oxford spared no expense for books; and\r\nDr. Mead, who trod closely upon their heels, cared not at what price\r\nhe purchased his _Editiones Principes_, and all the grand books which\r\nstamped such a value upon his collection. And yet, let us look at the\r\npriced catalogue of his library, or at that of his successor Dr.\r\nAskew, and compare the sums _then_ given for those _now_ offered for\r\nsimilar works!\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 183: As a little essay, and a very curious one\r\n     too, might be written upon the history of BOOK-BINDING, I\r\n     shall not attempt in the present note satisfactorily to\r\n     supply such a desideratum; but merely communicate to the\r\n     reader a few particulars which have come across me in my\r\n     desultory researches upon the subject. Mr. Astle tells us\r\n     that the famous _Textus Sancti Cuthberti_, which was written\r\n     in the 7th century, and was formerly kept at Durham, and is\r\n     now preserved in the Cottonian library, (Nero, D. IV.) was\r\n     adorned in the Saxon times by Bilfrith, a monk of Durham,\r\n     with a silver cover gilt, and precious stones. Simeon\r\n     Dunelmensis, or Turgot, as he is frequently called, tells us\r\n     that the cover of this fine MS. was ornamented \"forensecis\r\n     Gemmis et Auro.\" \"A booke of Gospelles garnished and wrought\r\n     with antique worke of silver and gilte with an image of the\r\n     crucifix with Mary and John, poiz together cccxxij oz.\" In\r\n     the secret Jewel House in the Tower. \"A booke of gold\r\n     enameled, clasped with a rubie, having on th' one side, a\r\n     crosse of dyamounts, and vj other dyamounts, and th' other\r\n     syde a flower de luce of dyamounts, and iiij rubies with a\r\n     pendaunte of white saphires and the arms of Englande.

Although Mr. Astle has not specified the time in\r\n     which these two latter books were bound, it is probable that\r\n     they were thus gorgeously attired before the discovery of\r\n     the art of printing. What the ancient Vicars of Chalk (in\r\n     Kent) used to pay for binding their missals, according to\r\n     the original endowment settled by Haymo de Hethe in 1327\r\n     (which compelled the vicars to be at the expense of the\r\n     same--_Reg. Roff._, p. 205), Mr. Denne has not informed us.\r\n     _Archæologia_, vol. xi., 362. But it would seem, from\r\n     Warton, that \"students and monks were anciently the binders\r\n     of books;\" and from their Latin entries respecting the same,\r\n     the word \"conjunctio\" appears to have been used for\r\n     \"ligatura.\" _Hist. of Engl. Poetry_, vol. ii., p. 244.\r\n     Hearne, in No. III. of the appendix to _Adam de Domerham\r\n     de reb. gest. Glast._, has \"published a grant from Rich. de\r\n     Paston to Bromholm abbey, of twelve pence a year rent charge\r\n     on his estates to _keep their books in repair_.\" This I\r\n     gather from Gough's _Brit. Topog._, vol. ii., p. 20: while\r\n     from the _Liber Stat. Eccl. Paulinæ_, Lond. MSS., f. 6, 396\r\n     (furnished me by my friend Mr. H. Ellis,[D] of the British\r\n     Museum), it appears to have been anciently considered as a\r\n     part of the Sacrist's duty to bind and clasp the books:\r\n     \"Sacrista curet quod _Libri bene ligentur et haspentur_,\" &c.\r\n     In Chaucer's time, one would think that the fashionable\r\n     binding for the books of young scholars was\r\n     _various-coloured velvet_: for thus our poet describes the\r\n     library of the Oxford Scholar:\r\n\r\n          A twenty bokes, clothed in black and red\r\n          Of Aristotle----\r\n\r\n          (_Prolog. to Cant.

Ellis) will\r\n     testify:----\"To Alice Claver, for the making of XVI laces\r\n     and XVI tasshels for the garnyshing of diuers of the Kings\r\n     books, ij_s._ viij_d._----And to Robert Boillet for blac\r\n     paper and nailles for closing and fastenyng of diuers cofyns\r\n     of ffyrre wherein the Kings boks were conveyed and caried\r\n     from the Kings grete warderobe in London vnto Eltham\r\n     aforesaid, v_d._----Piers Bauduyn Stacioner for bynding\r\n     gilding and dressing of a booke called Titus Liuius, xx_s_:\r\n     for binding gilding and dressing of a booke called\r\n     Ffrossard, xvj_s_: or binding gilding and dressing of a\r\n     booke called the Bible, xvj_s_: for binding gilding and\r\n     dressing of a booke called le Gouuernement of Kings and\r\n     Princes, xvj_s._\" \"For the dressing of ij books whereof oon\r\n     is called la forteresse de Foy and the other called the\r\n     booke of Josephus, iij_s._ iiij_d._ And for binding gilding\r\n     and dressing of a booke called the bible historial, xx_s._\"\r\n     Among the expenses entered in the Wardrobe Accompts 20th\r\n     Edw.

I suspect that it was not 'till towards the close\r\n     of the 15th century, when the sister art of painting\r\n     directed that of engraving, that books were bound in thick\r\n     boards, with leather covering upon the same; curiously\r\n     stamped with arabesque, and other bizarre, ornaments. In the\r\n     interior of this binding, next to the leaves, there was\r\n     sometimes an excavation, in which a silver crucifix was\r\n     safely guarded by a metal door, with clasps. The exterior of\r\n     the binding had oftentimes large embossed ornaments of\r\n     silver, and sometimes of precious stones [as a note in the\r\n     Appendix to the _History of Leicester_, by Mr. Nichols, p.\r\n     102, indicates--and as Geyler himself, in his _Ship of\r\n     Fools_, entitled \"_Navicula, sive Speculum Fatuorum_,\" edit.\r\n     1511, 4to., thus expressly declares:--\"sunt qui libros\r\n     inaurunt et serica tegimenta apponunt preciosa et superba,\"\r\n     sign. B. v. rev.], as well as the usual ornaments upon the\r\n     leather; and two massive clasps, with thick metalled corners\r\n     on each of the outward sides of the binding, seemed to\r\n     render a book impervious to such depredations of time as\r\n     could arise from external injury. Meantime, however the worm\r\n     was secretly engendered within the wood: and his perforating\r\n     ravages in the precious leaves of the volume gave dreadful\r\n     proof of the defectiveness of ancient binding, beautiful and\r\n     bold as it undoubtedly was! The reader is referred to an\r\n     account of a preciously bound diminutive godly book (once\r\n     belonging to Q. Elizabeth), in the first volume of my\r\n     edition of the British _Typographical Antiquities_, p. 83;\r\n     for which I understand the present owner asks the sum of\r\n     160_l._ We find that in the sixteenth year of Elizabeth's\r\n     reign, she was in possession of \"Oone Gospell booke covered\r\n     with tissue and garnished on th' onside with the crucifix\r\n     and the Queene's badges of silver guilt, poiz with wodde,\r\n     leaves, and all, czij. oz.\" _Archæologia_, vol. xiii., 221.\r\n     I am in possession of the covers of a book, bound (A.D.\r\n     1569) in thick parchment or vellum, which has the whole\r\n     length portrait of Luther on one side, and of Calvin on the\r\n     other. These portraits, which are executed with uncommon\r\n     spirit and accuracy, are encircled with a profusion of\r\n     ornamental borders of the most exquisite taste and richness.\r\n     We shall speak occasionally of more modern book-binding as\r\n     we proceed.

You allude to a late sale in Pall Mall, of one of the choicest\r\nand most elegant libraries ever collected by a man of letters and\r\ntaste?\r\n\r\n\"I do, Lisardo--but see we are just entering the smoke and bustle of\r\nLondon; and in ten minutes shall have reached the scene of action.\"\r\n\r\nPHIL. How do you feel?\r\n\r\nLIS. Why, tolerably calm. My pulse beats as leisurely as did my Lord\r\nStrafford's at his trial--or (to borrow Hamlet's phrase)\r\n\r\n       --as yours, it doth temperately keep time,\r\n     And makes as healthful music.\r\n\r\nPHIL. Ninety-five to the minute! You are just now in a fit frame of\r\nmind to write a political pamphlet. Pray consider what will be the\r\nissue of this madness?\r\n\r\nLIS. No more! Now for my catalogue; and let me attend to my marks. But\r\nour friend is not forgetful of his promise?\r\n\r\nPHIL. I dare say he will assist us in regulating the prices we ought\r\nto give--and more particularly in making us acquainted with the most\r\nnotable book-collectors.\r\n\r\nUpon my readily acquiescing in their demand, we leapt from the chaise\r\n(giving orders for it to attend by three o'clock) and hurried\r\nimmediately up stairs into THE AUCTION ROOM.\r\n\r\nThe clock had struck twelve, and in half an hour the sale was to\r\nbegin. Not more than nine or ten gentlemen were strolling about the\r\nroom: some examining the volumes which were to be sold, and making\r\nhieroglyphical marks thereupon, in their catalogues: some giving\r\ncommissions to the clerk who entered their names, with the sums they\r\nintended staking, in a manner equally hieroglyphical. Others, again,\r\nseemed to be casting an eye of vacancy over the whole collection; or\r\nwaiting till a book friend arrived with whom they might enter into a\r\nlittle chat. You observe, my friends, said I, softly, yonder active\r\nand keen-visaged gentleman? 'Tis LEPIDUS. Like Magliabechi, content\r\nwith frugal fare and frugal clothing[186] and preferring the riches of\r\na library to those of house-furniture, he is insatiable in his\r\nbibliomaniacal appetites. \"Long experience has made him sage:\" and it\r\nis not therefore without just reason that his opinions are courted,\r\nand considered as almost oracular. You will find that he will take his\r\nold station, commanding the right or left wing of the auctioneer; and\r\nthat he will enliven, by the gaiety and shrewdness of his remarks, the\r\ncircle that more immediately surrounds him. Some there are who will\r\nnot bid 'till Lepidus bids; and who surrender all discretion and\r\nopinion of their own to his universal book-knowledge. The consequence\r\nis that Lepidus can, with difficulty, make purchases for his own\r\nlibrary; and a thousand dexterous and happy manoeuvres are of\r\nnecessity obliged to be practised by him, whenever a rare or curious\r\nbook turns up. How many fine collections has this sagacious\r\nbibliomaniac seen disposed of! Like Nestor, who preaches about the\r\nfine fellows he remembered in his youth, Lepidus (although barely yet\r\nin his grand climacteric!) will depicture, with moving eloquence, the\r\nnumerous precious volumes of far-famed collectors, which he has seen,\r\nlike Macbeth's witches,\r\n\r\n     \"Come like shadows, so depart!\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 186: Tenni cultu, victuque contentus, quidquid ei\r\n     pecuniæ superaret in omnigenæ eruditionis libros comparandos\r\n     erogabat, selectissimamque voluminum multitudinem ea mente\r\n     adquisivit, ut aliquando posset publicæ utilitati--dicari,\r\n     _Præf. Bibl. Magliab. a Fossio_, p. x.]\r\n\r\nAnd when any particular class of books, now highly coveted, but\r\nformerly little esteemed, comes under the hammer, and produces a large\r\nsum,--ah then! 'tis pleasant to hear Lepidus exclaim--\r\n\r\n     O mihi præteritos referat si Jupiter annos!\r\n\r\nJustly respectable as are his scholarship and good sense, he is not\r\nwhat you may call a _fashionable_ collector; for old chronicles and\r\nromances are most rigidly discarded from his library. Talk to him of\r\nHoffmen, Schoettgenius, Rosenmuller, and Michaelis, and he will listen\r\ncourteously to your conversation; but when you expatiate, however\r\nlearnedly and rapturously, upon Froissart and Prince Arthur, he will\r\ntell you that he has a heart of stone upon the subject; and that even\r\na clean uncut copy of an original impression of each, by Verard or by\r\nCaxton, would not bring a single tear of sympathetic transport in his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nLIS. I will not fail to pay due attention to so extraordinary and\r\ninteresting a character--for see, he is going to take his\r\ndistinguished station in the approaching contest. The hammer of the\r\nworthy auctioneer, which I suppose is of as much importance as was Sir\r\nFopling's periwig of old,[187] upon the stage--the hammer is upon the\r\ndesk!--The company begin to increase and close their ranks; and the\r\ndin of battle will shortly be heard. Let us keep these seats. Now,\r\ntell me who is yonder strange looking gentleman?\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 187: See Warburton's piquant note, in Mr. Bowles's\r\n     edition of _Pope's Works_, vol. v., p. 116. \"This remarkable\r\n     _periwiy_ [Transcriber's Note: periwig] (says he) usually\r\n     made its entrance upon the stage in a sedan chair, brought\r\n     in by two chairmen with infinite approbation of the\r\n     audience.\" The _snuff-box_ of Mr. L. has not a less imposing\r\n     air; and when a high-priced book is balancing between 15_l._\r\n     and 20_l._ it is a fearful signal of its reaching an\r\n     additional sum, if Mr. L. should lay down his hammer, and\r\n     delve into this said crumple-horned snuff-box!]\r\n\r\n\"'Tis MUSTAPHA, a vender of books. Consuetudine invalescens, ac veluti\r\ncallum diuturna cogitatione obducens,[188] he comes forth, like an\r\nalchemist from his laboratory, with hat and wig 'sprinkled with\r\nlearned dust,' and deals out his censures with as little ceremony as\r\ncorrectness. It is of no consequence to him by whom positions are\r\nadvanced, or truth is established; and he hesitates very little about\r\ncalling Baron Heinecken a Tom fool, or ---- a shameless impostor. If\r\nyour library were as choice and elegant as Dr. H----'s he would tell\r\nyou that his own disordered shelves and badly coated books presented\r\nan infinitely more precious collection; nor must you be at all\r\nsurprised at this--for, like Braithwait's Upotomis,\r\n\r\n     'Though weak in judgment, in opinion strong;'\r\n\r\nor, like the same author's Meilixos,\r\n\r\n     'Who deems all wisdom treasur'd in his pate,'\r\n\r\nour book-vender, in the catalogues which he puts forth, shews himself\r\nto be 'a great and bold carpenter of words;'[189] overcharging the\r\ndescription of his own volumes with tropes, metaphors, flourishes, and\r\ncommon-place authorities; the latter of which one would think had but\r\nrecently come under his notice, as they had been already before the\r\npublic in various less ostentatious forms.\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 188: The curious reader may see the entire caustic\r\n     passage in Spizelius's _Infelix Literatus_, p. 435.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 189: _Coryat's Crudities_, vol. i., sign.

I think as highly of our own as did the author\r\nof the Aprosian library[190] of the Dutch booksellers; and I love to\r\nhear that the bibliographical labour bestowed upon a catalogue has\r\nanswered the end proposed, by sharpening the appetites of purchasers.\r\nBut the present is a different case. Mustapha might have learnt good\r\nsense and good manners, from his right hand, or left hand, or\r\nopposite, neighbour; but he is either too conceited, or too obstinate,\r\nto have recourse to such aid. What is very remarkable, although he is\r\nconstantly declaiming against the enormous sums of money given for\r\nbooks at public auctions, Mustapha doth not scruple to push the\r\npurchaser to the last farthing of his commission; from a ready knack\r\nwhich he hath acquired, by means of some magical art in his foresaid\r\nlaboratory, of deciphering the same; thus adopting in a most\r\nextraordinary manner, the very line of conduct himself which he so\r\ntartly censures in others.\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 190: See pages 103-4, of Wolfius's edition of the\r\n     _Bibliotheca Aprosiana_, 1734, 8vo. It is not because Mr.\r\n     Ford, of Manchester, has been kind enough to present me with\r\n     one of the _six_ copies of his last catalogue of books,\r\n     printed upon STRONG WRITING PAPER--that I take this\r\n     opportunity of praising the contents of it,--but that his\r\n     catalogues are to be praised for the pains which he exhibits\r\n     in describing his books, and in referring to numerous\r\n     bibliographical authorities in the description. While upon\r\n     this subject, let me recommend the youthful bibliomaniac to\r\n     get possession of Mr. Edwards's catalogues, and especially\r\n     of that of 1794. If such a catalogue were but recently\r\n     published, it would be one of the pleasantest breakfast\r\n     lounges imaginable to _tick off_ a few of the volumes with\r\n     the hope of possessing them at the prices therein afixed.]\r\n\r\nPHIL. Was this the gentleman whose catalogue (as you shewed me)\r\ncontained the fascinating colophon of Juliana Berner's book of\r\nhawking, hunting, and heraldry, printed in the year 1486, subjoined to\r\na copy of the common reprint of it by Gervase Markham--thereby\r\nprovoking a thousand inquiries after the book, as if it had been the\r\nfirst edition?\r\n\r\n\"The same,\" resumed I. \"But let us leave such ridiculous vanity.\"\r\n\r\nLIS. Who is that gentleman, standing towards the right of the\r\nauctioneer, and looking so intently upon his catalogue?\r\n\r\n\"You point to my friend BERNARDO. He is thus anxious, because an\r\noriginal fragment of the fair lady's work, which you have just\r\nmentioned, is coming under the hammer; and powerful indeed must be the\r\nobject to draw his attention another way. The demure prioress of\r\nSopewell abbey is his ancient sweetheart; and he is about introducing\r\nher to his friends, by a union with her as close and as honourable as\r\nthat of wedlock. Engaged in a laborious profession (the duties of\r\nwhich are faithfully performed by him) Bernardo devotes his few\r\nleisure hours to the investigation of old works; thinking with the\r\nancient poet, quoted by Ashmole, that\r\n\r\n     '----out of old fields as men saythe\r\n     Cometh all this new corne fro yeare to yeare;\r\n     And out of olde Bokes in good faythe\r\n     Cometh all this scyence that men leare:'\r\n\r\nor, with Ashmole himself; that 'old words have strong emphasis: others\r\nmay look upon them as rubbish or trifles, but they are grossly\r\nmistaken: for what some light brains may esteem as foolish toys,\r\ndeeper judgments can and will value as sound and serious matter.[191]'\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 191: _Theatrum Chemicum_: proleg. sign. A. 3.\r\n     rev.: B. 4. rect. The charms of ancient phraseology had been\r\n     before not less eloquently described by Wolfius: \"Habet hoc\r\n     jucundi priscorum quorundam obsoleta dictio, ac suo quodam\r\n     modo rudius comta oratio, ut ex ea plus intelligamus quam\r\n     dicitur; plus significetur quam effertur.\" _Lect. Memorab.\r\n     Epist. Ded._ fol. xiv. rev. Of Wolfius, and of this his\r\n     work, the reader will find some mention at page 110, ante.]\r\n\r\n\"If you ask me whether Bernardo be always successful in his labours, I\r\nshould answer you, as I have told him, No: for the profit and applause\r\nattendant upon them are not commensurate with his exertions. Moreover,\r\nI do verily think that, in some few instances, he sacrifices his\r\njudgment to another's whim; by a reluctance to put out the strength of\r\nhis own powers. He is also, I had almost said, the admiring slave of\r\nRitsonian fastidiousness; and will cry 'pish' if a _u_ be put for a\r\n_v_, or a _single e_ for a _double one_: but take him fairly as he is,\r\nand place him firmly in the bibliographical scale, and you will\r\nacknowledge that his weight is far from being inconsiderable. He is a\r\nrespectable, and every way a praise-worthy man: and although he is\r\ncontinually walking in a thick forest of black letter, and would\r\nprefer a book printed before the year 1550, to a turtle dressed\r\naccording to the rules of Mr. Farley, yet he can ever and anon sally\r\nforth to enjoy a stroll along the river side, with Isaac Walton[192]\r\nin his hand; when 'he hath his wholesome walk and merry, at his ease:\r\na sweet air of the sweet savour of the mead flowers, that maketh him\r\nhungry.'[193]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 192: \"Let me take this opportunity of recommending\r\n     the amiable and venerable ISAAC WALTON'S _Complete Angler_:\r\n     a work the most singular of its kind, breathing the very\r\n     spirit of contentment, of quiet, and unaffected\r\n     philanthrophy, and interspersed with some beautiful relics\r\n     of poetry, old songs, and ballads.\" So speaks the Rev. W.\r\n     Lisle Bowles, in his edition of _Pope's Works_, vol i., p.\r\n     135. To which I add--Let me take this opportunity of\r\n     recommending Mr. Bagster's very beautiful and creditable\r\n     reprint of Sir John Hawkin's edition of Walton's amusing\r\n     little book. The plates in it are as true as they are\r\n     brilliant: and the bibliomaniac may gratify his appetite,\r\n     however voracious, by having copies of it upon paper of all\r\n     sizes. Mr. Bagster has also very recently published an\r\n     exquisite facsimile of the original edition of old Isaac.\r\n     Perhaps I ought not to call it a fac-simile, for it is, in\r\n     many respects, more beautifully executed.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 193: The reader may see all this, and much more,\r\n     dressed in its ancient orthographic garb, in a proheme to\r\n     the first edition of the merry art of fishing, extracted by\r\n     Herbert in his first volume, p. 131. I have said the\r\n     \"_merry_,\" and not the \"_contemplative_,\" art of\r\n     fishing--because we are informed that \"Yf the angler take\r\n     fyshe, surely thenne is there noo man _merier_ than he is in\r\n     his spyryte!!\" Yet Isaac Walton called this art, \"The\r\n     _Contemplative_ Man's Recreation.\" But a _book-fisherman_,\r\n     like myself, must not presume to reconcile such great and\r\n     contradictory authorities.]\r\n\r\n\"But see--the hammer is vibrating, at an angle of twenty-two and a\r\nhalf, over a large paper priced catalogue of Major Pearson's\r\nbooks!--Who is the lucky purchaser?\r\n\r\n\"QUISQUILIUS:--a victim to the Bibliomania. If one single copy of a\r\nwork happen to be printed in a more particular manner than another;\r\nand if the compositor (clever rogue) happen to have transposed or\r\ninverted a whole sentence or page; if a plate or two, no matter of\r\nwhat kind or how executed; go along with it, which is not to be found\r\nin the remaining copies; if the paper happen to be _unique_ in point\r\nof size--whether MAXIMA or MINIMA--oh, then, thrice happy is\r\nQuisquilius! With a well-furnished purse, the strings of which are\r\nliberally loosened, he devotes no small portion of wealth to the\r\naccumulation of _Prints_; and can justly boast of a collection of\r\nwhich few of his contemporaries are possessed. But his walk in\r\nbook-collecting is rather limited. He seldom rambles into the\r\nluxuriancy of old English black-letter literature; and cares still\r\nless for a _variorum_ Latin classic, stamped in the neat mintage of\r\nthe Elzevir press. Of a Greek _Aldus_, or an Italian _Giunta_, he has\r\nnever yet had the luxury to dream:--'trahit sua quemque voluptas;' and\r\nlet Quisquilius enjoy his hobby-horse, even to the riding of it to\r\ndeath! But let him not harbour malevolence against supposed injuries\r\ninflicted: let not foolish prejudices, or unmanly suspicions, rankle\r\nin his breast: authors and book-collectors are sometimes as\r\nenlightened as himself, and have cultivated pursuits equally\r\nhonourable. Their profession, too, may sometimes be equally beneficial\r\nto their fellow creatures. A few short years shall pass away, and it\r\nwill be seen who has contributed the more effectively to the public\r\nstock of amusement and instruction. We wrap ourselves up in our own\r\nlittle vanities and weaknesses, and, fancying wealth and wisdom to be\r\nsynonymous, vent our spleen against those who are resolutely striving,\r\nunder the pressure of mediocrity and domestic misfortune, to obtain an\r\nhonourable subsistence by their intellectual exertions.\"\r\n\r\nLIS. A truce to this moralizing strain. Pass we on to a short\r\ngentleman, busily engaged yonder in looking at a number of volumes,\r\nand occasionally conversing with two or three gentlemen from five to\r\nten inches taller than himself. What is his name?\r\n\r\n\"ROSICRUSIUS is his name; and an ardent and indefatigable book-forager\r\nhe is. Although just now busily engaged in antiquarian researches\r\nrelating to British typography, he fancies himself nevertheless deeply\r\ninterested in the discovery of every ancient book printed abroad.\r\nExamine his little collection of books, and you will find that\r\n\r\n     'There Caxton sleeps, with Wynkyn at his side,\r\n     One clasp'd in wood, and one in strong cow-hide!'[194]\r\n\r\n--and yet, a beautiful volume printed at 'Basil or Heidelberg makes\r\nhim spinne: and at seeing the word Frankford or Venice, though but on\r\nthe title of a booke, he is readie to break doublet, cracke elbows,\r\nand over-flowe the room with his murmure.'[195] Bibliography is his\r\ndarling delight--'una voluptas et meditatio assidua;'[196] and in\r\ndefence of the same he would quote you a score of old-fashioned\r\nauthors, from Gesner to Harles, whose very names would excite\r\nscepticism about their existence. He is the author of various works,\r\nchiefly bibliographical; upon which the voice of the public (if we\r\nexcept a little wicked quizzing at his _black-letter_ propensities in\r\na celebrated North Briton Review) has been generally favourable.\r\nAlthough the old maidenish particularity of Tom Hearne's genius be not\r\nmuch calculated to please a bibliomaniac of lively parts, yet\r\nRosicrusius seems absolutely enamoured of that ancient wight; and to\r\nbe in possession of the cream of all his pieces, if we may judge from\r\nwhat he has already published, and promises to publish, concerning the\r\nsame. He once had the temerity to dabble in poetry;[197] but he never\r\ncould raise his head above the mists which infest the swampy ground at\r\nthe foot of Parnassus. Still he loves 'the divine art' enthusiastically;\r\nand affects, forsooth, to have a taste in matters of engraving and\r\npainting! Converse with him about Guercino and Albert Durer, Berghem\r\nand Woollett, and tell him that you wish to have his opinion about the\r\nerection of a large library, and he will 'give tongue' to you from\r\nrise to set of sun. Wishing him prosperity in his projected works, and\r\nall good fellows to be his friends, proceed we in our descriptive\r\nsurvey.\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 194: Pope's _Dunciad_, b. i. v. 149.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 195: _Coryat's Crudities_, vol. i., sign.

Such a champion as Atticus has perhaps never\r\nbefore appeared within the arena of book-gladiators:\r\n\r\n     'Blest with talents, wealth, and taste;'[198]\r\n\r\nand gifted with no common powers of general scholarship, he can easily\r\nmaster a knotty passage in Eschylus or Aristotle; and quote Juvenal\r\nand Horace as readily as the junior lads at Eton quote their '_As in\r\npræsenti_:' moreover, he can enter, with equal ardour, into a minute\r\ndiscussion about the romance literature of the middle ages, and the\r\ndry though useful philology of the German school during the 16th and\r\n17th centuries. In the pursuit after rare, curious, and valuable\r\nbooks, nothing daunts or depresses him. With a mental and bodily\r\nconstitution such as few possess, and with a perpetual succession of\r\nnew objects rising up before him, he seems hardly ever conscious of\r\nthe vicissitudes of the seasons, and equally indifferent to petty\r\nchanges in politics. The cutting blasts of Siberia, or the fainting\r\nheat of a Maltese sirocco, would not make him halt, or divert his\r\ncourse, in the pursuit of a favourite volume, whether in the Greek,\r\nLatin, Spanish, or Italian language. But as all human efforts, however\r\npowerful, if carried on without intermission, must have a period of\r\ncessation; and as the most active body cannot be at 'Thebes and at\r\nAthens' at the same moment; so it follows that Atticus cannot be at\r\nevery auction and carry away every prize. His rivals narrowly watch,\r\nand his enemies closely way-lay, him; and his victories are rarely\r\nbloodless in consequence. If, like Darwin's whale, which swallows\r\n'millions at a gulp,' Atticus should, at one auction, purchase from\r\ntwo to seven hundred volumes, he must retire, like the '_Boa\r\nConstrictor_,' for digestion: and accordingly he does, for a short\r\nseason, withdraw himself from 'the busy hum' of sale rooms, to\r\ncollate, methodize, and class his newly acquired treasures--to repair\r\nwhat is defective, and to beautify what is deformed. Thus rendering\r\nthem 'companions meet' for their brethren in the rural shades of H----\r\nHall; where, in gay succession, stands many a row, heavily laden with\r\n'rich and rare' productions. In this rural retreat, or academic bower,\r\nAtticus spends a due portion of the autumnal season of the year; now\r\nthat the busy scenes of book-auctions in the metropolis have changed\r\ntheir character--and dreary silence, and stagnant dirt, have succeeded\r\nto noise and flying particles of learned dust.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 198: Dr. Ferriar's _Bibliomania_, v. 12.]\r\n\r\n\"Here, in his ancestral abode, Atticus can happily exchange the\r\nmicroscopic investigation of books for the charms and manly exercises\r\nof a rural life; eclipsing, in this particular, the celebrity of Cæsar\r\nAntoninus; who had not universality of talent sufficient to unite the\r\nlove of hawking and hunting with the passion for book-collecting.[199]\r\nThe sky is no sooner dappled o'er with the first morning sun-beams,\r\nthan up starts our distinguished bibliomaniac, either to shoot or to\r\nhunt; either to realize all the fine things which Pope has written\r\nabout 'lifting the tube, and levelling the eye;'[200] or to join the\r\njolly troop while they chant the hunting song of his poetical\r\nfriend.[201] Meanwhile, his house is not wanting in needful garniture\r\nto render a country residence most congenial. His cellars below vie\r\nwith his library above. Besides 'the brown October'--'drawn from his\r\ndark retreat of thirty years'--and the potent comforts of every\r\nspecies of 'barley broth'--there are the ruddier and more sparkling\r\njuices of the grape--'fresh of colour, and of look lovely, smiling to\r\nthe eyz of many'--as Master Laneham hath it in his celebrated\r\nletter.[202] I shall leave you to finish the picture, which such a\r\nsketch may suggest, by referring you to your favourite, Thomson.\"[203]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 199: This anecdote is given on the authority of\r\n     Kesner's [Transcriber's Note: Gesner's] _Pandects_, fol. 29:\r\n     rect.

Your account of so extraordinary a bibliomaniac is quite amusing:\r\nbut I suspect you exaggerate a little.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, Lisardo, I speak nothing but the truth. In book-reputation,\r\nAtticus unites all the activity of De Witt and Lomanie, with the\r\nretentiveness of Magliabechi and the learning of Le Long.[204] And\r\nyet--he has his peccant part.\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 204: The reader will be pleased to turn for one\r\n     minute to pages 49, 85, 86, ante.]\r\n\r\nLIS. Speak, I am anxious to know.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Lisardo; although what Leichius hath said of the library\r\nattached to the senate-house of Leipsic be justly applicable to his\r\nown extraordinary collection[205]--yet ATTICUS doth sometimes sadly\r\nerr. He has now and then an ungovernable passion to possess more\r\ncopies of a book than there were ever parties to a deed, or stamina to\r\na plant: and therefore I cannot call him a duplicate or triplicate\r\ncollector. His best friends scold--his most respectable rivals\r\ncensure--and a whole 'mob of gentlemen' who think to collect 'with\r\nease,' threaten vengeance against--him, for this despotic spirit which\r\nhe evinces; and which I fear nothing can stay or modify but an act of\r\nparliament that no gentleman shall purchase more than two copies of a\r\nwork; one for his town, the other for his country, residence.\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 205: Singularis eius ac propensi, in iuvandam\r\n     eruditionem studii insigne imprimis monumentum exstat,\r\n     Bibliotheca instructissima, sacrarium bonæ menti dicatum, in\r\n     quo omne, quod transmitti ad posteritatem meretur, copiose\r\n     reconditum est. _e [Transcriber's Note: De] Orig. et\r\n     Increment.

This is the 'pars melior' of every book\r\ncollector, and it is indeed the better part with Atticus. The learned\r\nand curious, whether rich or poor, have always free access to his\r\nlibrary--\r\n\r\n     His volumes, open as his heart,\r\n     Delight, amusement, science, art,\r\n     To every ear and eye impart.\r\n\r\nHis books, therefore, are not a stagnant reservoir of unprofitable\r\nwater, as are those of PONTEVALLO'S; but like a thousand rills, which\r\nrun down from the lake on Snowdon's summit, after a plentiful fall of\r\nrain, they serve to fertilize and adorn every thing to which they\r\nextend. In consequence, he sees himself reflected in a thousand\r\nmirrors: and has a right to be vain of the numerous dedications to\r\nhim, and of the richly ornamented robes in which he is attired by his\r\ngrateful friends.\"\r\n\r\nLIS. Long life to Atticus, and to all such book heroes! Now pray\r\ninform me who is yonder gentleman, of majestic mien and shape?--and\r\nwho strikes a stranger with as much interest as Agamemnon did\r\nPriam--when the Grecian troops passed at a distance in order of\r\nreview, while the Trojan monarch and Helen were gossipping with each\r\nother on the battlements of Troy!\r\n\r\n\"That gentleman, Lisardo, is HORTENSIUS; who, you see is in close\r\nconversation with an intimate friend and fellow-bibliomaniac--that\r\nycleped is ULPIAN. They are both honourable members of an honourable\r\nprofession; and although they have formerly sworn to purchase no old\r\nbook but Machlinia's first edition of Littleton's Tenures, yet they\r\ncannot resist, now and then, the delicious impulse of becoming masters\r\nof a black-letter chronicle or romance. Taste and talent of various\r\nkind they both possess; and 'tis truly pleasant to see gentlemen and\r\nscholars, engaged in a laborious profession, in which, comparatively,\r\n'little vegetation quickens, and few salutary plants take root,'\r\nfinding 'a pleasant grove for their wits to walk in' amidst rows of\r\nbeautifully bound, and intrinsically precious, volumes. They feel it\r\ndelectable, 'from the loop-holes of such a retreat,' to peep at the\r\nmultifarious pursuits of their brethren; and while they discover some\r\nbusied in a perversion of book-taste, and others preferring the\r\nshort-lived pleasures of sensual gratifications--which must 'not be\r\nnamed' among good bibliomaniacs--they can sit comfortably by their\r\nfire-sides; and, pointing to a well-furnished library, say to their\r\nwives--who heartily sympathize in the sentiment--\r\n\r\n     This gives us health, or adds to life a day!\"[206]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 206: Braithwaite's _Arcadian Princesse_: lib. 4,\r\n     p. 15, edit. 1635.

When I come to town to settle, pray introduce me to these amiable\r\nand sensible bibliomaniacs. Now gratify a curiosity that I feel to\r\nknow the name and character of yonder respectably-looking gentleman,\r\nin the dress of the old school, who is speaking in so gracious a\r\nmanner to Bernardo?\r\n\r\n\"'Tis LEONTES: a man of taste, and an accomplished antiquary. Even yet\r\nhe continues to gratify his favourite passion for book and\r\nprint-collecting; although his library is at once choice and copious,\r\nand his collection of prints exquisitely fine. He yet enjoys, in the\r\nevening of life, all that unruffled temper and gentlemanly address\r\nwhich delighted so much in his younger days, and which will always\r\nrender him, in his latter years, equally interesting and admired. Like\r\nAtticus, he is liberal in the loan of his treasures; and, as with him,\r\nso 'tis with Leontes--the spirit of book-collecting 'assumes the\r\ndignity of a virtue.'[207] Peace and comfort be the attendant spirits\r\nof Leontes, through life, and in death: the happiness of a better\r\nworld await him beyond the grave! His memory will always be held in\r\nreverence by honest bibliomaniacs; and a due sense of his kindness\r\ntowards myself shall constantly be impressed upon me--\r\n\r\n     Dum memor ipse mei, dum spiritus hos regret artus.\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 207: _Edinburgh Review_, vol. xiii., p. 118.]\r\n\r\nPHIL. Amen. With Leontes I suppose you close your account of the most\r\nnotorious bibliomaniacs who generally attend book sales in person; for\r\nI observe no other person who mingles with those already\r\ndescribed--unless indeed, three very active young ones, who\r\noccasionally converse with each other, and now and then have their\r\nnames affixed to some very expensive purchases--\r\n\r\n\"They are the three MERCURII, oftentimes deputed by distinguished\r\nbibliomaniacs: who, fearful of the sharp-shooting powers of their\r\nadversaries, if they _themselves_ should appear in the ranks, like\r\nprudent generals, keep aloof. But their aides-de-camp are not always\r\nsuccessful in their missions; for such is the obstinacy with which\r\nbook-battles are now contested, that it requires three times the\r\nnumber of guns and weight of metal to accomplish a particular object\r\nto what it did when John Duke of Marlborough wore his full-bottomed\r\nperiwig at the battle of Blenheim.\r\n\r\n\"Others there are, again, who employ these Mercurii from their own\r\ninability to attend in person, owing to distance, want of time, and\r\nother similar causes. Hence, many a desperate bibliomaniac keeps in\r\nthe back-ground; while the public are wholly unacquainted with his\r\ncurious and rapidly-increasing treasures. Hence SIR TRISTRAM,\r\nembosomed in his forest-retreat,\r\n\r\n           --down the steepy linn\r\n     That hems his little garden in,\r\n\r\nis constantly increasing his stores of tales of genii, fairies, fays,\r\nghosts, hobgoblins, magicians, highwaymen, and desperadoes--and\r\nequally acceptable to him is a copy of Castalio's elegant version of\r\nHomer, and of St. Dunstan's book '_De Occulta Philosophia_;'\r\nconcerning which lattter [Transcriber's Note: latter], Elias Ashmole\r\nis vehement in commendation.[208] From all these (after melting them\r\ndown in his own unparalleled poetical crucible--which hath charms as\r\npotent as the witches' cauldron in Macbeth) he gives the world many a\r\nwondrous-sweet song. Who that has read the exquisite poems, of the\r\nfame of which all Britain 'rings from side to side,' shall deny to\r\nsuch ancient legends a power to charm and instruct? Or who, that\r\npossesses a copy of PROSPERO'S excellent volumes, although composed in\r\na different strain (yet still more fruitful in ancient matters), shall\r\nnot love the memory and exalt the renown of such transcendent\r\nbibliomaniacs? The library of Prospero is indeed acknowledged to be\r\nwithout a rival in its way. How pleasant it is, dear Philemon, only to\r\ncontemplate such a goodly prospect of elegantly bound volumes of old\r\nEnglish and French literature!--and to think of the matchless stores\r\nwhich they contain, relating to our ancient popular tales and romantic\r\nlegends!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 208: He who shall have the happiness to meet with\r\n     St. Dunstan's Worke \"_De Occulta Philosophia_,\" may therein\r\n     reade such stories as will make him amaz'd, &c. Prolegom. to\r\n     his _Theatrum Chemicum_, sign A., 4. rev.]\r\n\r\n\"Allied to this library, in the general complexion of its literary\r\ntreasures, is that of MARCELLUS: while in the possession of numberless\r\nrare and precious volumes relating to the drama, and especially to his\r\nbeloved Shakespeare, it must be acknowledged that Marcellus hath\r\nsomewhat the superiority. Meritorious as have been his labours in the\r\nillustration of our immortal bard, he is yet as zealous, vigilant, and\r\nanxious, as ever, to accumulate every thing which may tend to the\r\nfurther illustration of him. Enter his book-cabinet; and with the\r\nsight of how many _unique_ pieces and tracts are your ardent eyes\r\nblessed! Just so it is with AURELIUS! He also, with the three last\r\nmentioned bibliomaniacs, keeps up a constant fire at book auctions;\r\nalthough he is not personally seen in securing the spoils which he\r\nmakes. Unparalleled as an antiquary in Caledonian history and poetry,\r\nand passionately attached to every thing connected with the fate of\r\nthe lamented Mary, as well as with that of the great poetical\r\ncontemporaries, Spenser and Shakespeare, Aurelius is indefatigable in\r\nthe pursuit of such ancient lore as may add value to the stores,\r\nhowever precious, which he possesses. His _Noctes Atticæ_, devoted to\r\nthe elucidation of the history of his native country, will erect to\r\nhis memory a splendid and imperishable monument. These, my dear\r\nfriends, these are the virtuous and useful, and therefore salutary\r\nends of book-collecting and book-reading. Such characters are among\r\nthe proudest pillars that adorn the greatest nations upon earth.\r\n\r\n\"Let me, however, not forget to mention that there are bashful or busy\r\nbibliomaniacs, who keep aloof from book-sales, intent only upon\r\nsecuring, by means of these Mercurii, _stainless_ or _large paper_\r\ncopies of ancient literature. While MENALCAS sees his oblong cabinet\r\ndecorated with such a tall, well-dressed, and perhaps matchless,\r\nregiment of _Variorum Classics_, he has little or no occasion to\r\nregret his unavoidable absence from the field of battle, in the Strand\r\nor Pall Mall. And yet--although he is environed with a body guard, of\r\nwhich the great Frederick's father might have envied him the\r\npossession, he cannot help casting a wishful eye, now and then, upon\r\nstill choicer and taller troops which he sees in the territories of\r\nhis rivals. I do not know whether he would not sacrifice the whole\r\nright wing of his army, for the securing of some magnificent treasures\r\nin the empire of his neighbour RINALDO: for there he sees, and adores,\r\nwith the rapture-speaking eye of a classical bibliomaniac, the tall,\r\nwide, thick, clean, brilliant, and illuminated copy of the _first\r\nLivy_ UPON VELLUM--enshrined in an impenetrable oaken case, covered\r\nwith choice morocco!\r\n\r\n\"There he often witnesses the adoration paid to this glorious object,\r\nby some bookish pilgrim, who, as the evening sun reposes softly upon\r\nthe hill, pushes onward, through copse, wood, moor, heath, bramble,\r\nand thicket, to feast his eyes upon the mellow lustre of its leaves,\r\nand upon the nice execution of its typography. Menalcas sees all\r\nthis; and yet has too noble a heart to envy Rinaldo his treasures!\r\nThese bibliomaniacs often meet and view their respective forces; but\r\nnever with hostile eyes. They know their relative strength; and wisely\r\nconsole themselves by being each 'eminent in his degree.' Like\r\nCorregio, they are 'also painters' in their way.\"\r\n\r\nPHIL. A well-a-day, Lisardo! Does not this recital chill your blood\r\nwith despair? Instead of making your purchases, you are only listening\r\nsupinely to our friend!\r\n\r\nLIS. Not exactly so. One of these obliging Mercurii has already\r\nexecuted a few commissions for me. You forget that our friend entered\r\ninto a little chat with him, just before we took possession of our\r\nseats. As to despair of obtaining book-gems similar to those of the\r\nfour last mentioned bibliomaniacs, I know not what to say--yet this I\r\nthink must be granted: no one could make a better use of them than\r\ntheir present owners. See, the elder Mercurius comes to tell me of a\r\npleasant acquisition to my library! What a murmur and confusion\r\nprevail about the auctioneer! Good news, I trust?\r\n\r\nAt this moment Lisardo received intelligence that he had obtained\r\npossession of the catalogues of the books of Bunau, Crevenna, and\r\nPinelli; and that, after a desperate struggle with QUISQUILIUS, he\r\ncame off victorious in a contest for De Bure's _Bibliographie\r\nInstructive_, _Gaignat's Catalogue_, and the two copious ones of the\r\n_Duke de la Valliere_: these four latter being half-bound and uncut,\r\nin nineteen volumes. Transport lit up the countenance of Lisardo, upon\r\nhis receiving this intelligence; but as pleasure and pain go hand in\r\nhand in this world, so did this young and unsuspecting bibliomaniac\r\nevince heavy affliction, on being told that he had failed in his\r\nattack upon the best editions of Le Long's _Bibliotheca Sacra_,\r\nFresnoy's _Méthode pour etudier l'Histoire_, and Baillet's _Jugemens\r\ndes Savans_--these having been carried off, at the point of the\r\nbayonet, by an irresistible onset from ATTICUS. \"Remember, my\r\nfriend,\" said I, in a soothing strain, \"remember that you are but a\r\nPolydore; and must expect to fall when you encounter Achilles.[209]\r\nThink of the honour you have acquired in this day's glorious contest;\r\nand, when you are drenching your cups of claret, at your hospitable\r\nboard, contemplate your De Bure as a trophy which will always make you\r\nrespected by your visitors! I am glad to see you revive. Yet further\r\nintelligence?\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 209: The reader may peruse the affecting death of\r\n     this beautiful youth, by the merciless Achilles, from the\r\n     407 to 418th verso of the xxth book of _Homer's Iliad_.\r\n     Fortunately for Lisardo, he survives the contest, and even\r\n     threatens revenge.]\r\n\r\nLIS. My good Mercurius, for whom a knife and fork shall always be laid\r\nat my table, has just informed me that Clement's _Bibliotheque\r\nCurieuse_, and Panzer's _Typographical Annals_, are knocked down to\r\nme, after Mustapha had picked me out for single combat, and battered\r\nmy breast-plate with a thousand furious strokes!\r\n\r\n\"You must always,\" said I, \"expect tough work from such an enemy, who\r\nis frequently both wanton and wild. But I congratulate you heartily on\r\nthe event of this day's contest. Let us now pack up and pay for our\r\ntreasures. Your servant has just entered the room, and the chaise is\r\nmost probably at the door.\"\r\n\r\nLIS. I am perfectly ready. Mercurius tells me that the whole amounts\r\nto----\r\n\r\nPHIL. Upwards of thirty guineas?\r\n\r\nLIS. Hard upon forty pounds. Here is the draft upon my banker: and\r\nthen for my precious tomes of bibliography! A thousand thanks, my\r\nfriend. I love this place of all things; and, after your minute\r\naccount of the characters of those who frequent it, I feel a strong\r\npropensity to become a deserving member of so respectable a\r\nfraternity. Leaving them all to return to their homes as satisfied as\r\nmyself, I wish them a hearty good day.\r\n\r\nUpon saying this, we followed Lisardo and his bibliographical\r\ntreasures into the chaise; and instantly set off, at a sharp trot, for\r\nthe quiet and comfort of green fields and running streams. As we\r\nrolled over Westminster-bridge, we bade farewell, like the historian\r\nof the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, to the\r\n\r\n     \"Fumum et opes strepitumque Romæ.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHISWICK HOUSE as in 1740.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\n=The Library.=\r\n\r\nDR.

HENRY'S HISTORY OF GREAT BRITAIN.\r\nA GAME OF CHESS.--OF MONACHISM AND CHIVALRY.\r\nDINNER AT LORENZO'S.\r\nSOME ACCOUNT OF BOOK-COLLECTORS IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the first seven miles of our return from the busy scene which\r\nhas just been described, it was sufficiently obvious that Lisardo was\r\nsuffering a little under the pangs of mortification. True it was, he\r\nhad filled his pocket with an ampler supply of pistoles than it ever\r\nfell to the lot of Gil Blas, at the same time of life, to be master\r\nof; but he had not calculated upon the similar condition of his\r\ncompetitors; some of whom had yet greater powers of purchase, and a\r\nmore resolute determination, as well as nicer skill, in exercising\r\nthese powers, than himself. Thus rushing into the combat with the heat\r\nand vehemence of youth, he was of necessity compelled to experience\r\nthe disappointment attendant upon such precipitancy. It was in vain\r\nthat Philemon and myself endeavoured to make him completely satisfied\r\nwith his purchase: nothing produced a look of complacency from him. At\r\nlength, upon seeing the rising ground which was within two or three\r\nmiles of our respective homes, he cheered up by degrees; and a sudden\r\nthought of the treasures contained in his Clement, De Bure and Panzer,\r\ndarted a gleam of satisfaction across his countenance. His eyes\r\nresumed their wonted brilliancy, and all the natural gaiety of his\r\ndisposition returned with full effect to banish every vapour of\r\nmelancholy. \"Indeed, my good friend,\" said he to me--\"I shall always\r\nhave reason to think and speak well of your kindness shewn towards me\r\nthis day; and although some years may elapse before a similar\r\ncollection may be disposed of--and I must necessarily wait a tedious\r\nperiod 'ere I get possession of Maittaire, Audiffredi, and others of\r\nthe old school--yet I hope to convince Lysander, on the exhibition of\r\nmy purchase, that my conversion to bibliography has been sincere. Yes:\r\nI perceive that I have food enough to digest, in the volumes which are\r\nnow my travelling companions, for two or three years to come--and if,\r\nby keeping a sharp look-out upon booksellers' catalogues when they are\r\nfirst published, I can catch hold of Vogt, Schelhorn and Heinecken, my\r\nprogress in bibliography, within the same period, must be downright\r\nmarvellous!\" \"I congratulate you,\" exclaimed PHILEMON, \"upon the\r\nreturn of your reason and good sense. I began to think that the story\r\nof Orlando had been thrown away upon you; and that his regular yearly\r\npurchases of a certain set of books, and making himself master of\r\ntheir principal contents before he ventured upon another similar\r\npurchase, had already been banished from your recollection.\"\r\n\r\nWe were now fast approaching the end of our journey; when the groom of\r\nLorenzo, mounted upon a well-bred courser, darted quickly by the\r\nchaise, apparently making towards my house--but on turning his head,\r\nand perceiving me within it, he drew up and bade the postilion stop. A\r\nnote from his master soon disclosed the reason of this interruption.\r\nLORENZO, upon hearing of the arrival of Lysander and Philemon, and of\r\ntheir wish to visit his library, had sent us all three a kind\r\ninvitation to dine with him on the morrow. His close intimacy with\r\nLisardo (who was his neighbour) had left no doubt in the mind of the\r\nlatter but that a similar note had been sent to his own house. After\r\ntelling the messenger that we would not fail to pay our respects to\r\nhis master, we drove briskly homewards; and found Lysander sitting on\r\na stile under some wide-spreading beech trees, at the entrance of the\r\npaddock, expecting our arrival. In less than half an hour we sat down\r\nto dinner (at a time greatly beyond what I was accustomed to);\r\nregaling Lysander, during the repast, with an account of the contest\r\nwe had witnessed; and every now and then preventing Lisardo from\r\nrushing towards his packet (even in the midst of his _fricandeau_),\r\nand displaying his book-treasures. After dinner, our discussion\r\nassumed a more methodical shape. Lysander bestowed his hearty\r\ncommendations upon the purchase; and, in order to whet the\r\nbibliomaniacal appetite of his young convert, he slyly observed that\r\nhis set of De Bure's pieces were _half bound_ and _uncut_; and that by\r\nhaving them bound in morocco, with gilt leaves, he would excel my own\r\nset; which latter was coated in a prettily-sprinkled calf leather,\r\nwith speckled edges. Lisardo could not repress the joyful sensations\r\nwhich this remark excited; and I observed that, whenever his eyes\r\nglanced upon my shelves, he afterwards returned them upon his own\r\nlittle collection, with a look of complacency mingled with exultation.\r\nIt was evident, therefore, that he was now thoroughly reconciled to\r\nhis fortune.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. During your absence, I have been reading a very favourite work\r\nof mine--DR. HENRY'S _History of Great Britain_; especially that part\r\nof it which I prefer so much to the history of human cunning and\r\nhuman slaughter; I mean, the account of learning and of learned men.\r\n\r\nPHIL. It is also a great favourite with me. But while I regret the\r\ninexcuseable omission of an index to such a voluminous work, and the\r\ninequality of Mr. Andrews's partial continuation of it, I must be\r\npermitted to observe that the history of our literature and learned\r\nmen is not the most brilliant, or best executed, part of Dr. Henry's\r\nvaluable labours. There are many omissions to supply, and much\r\ninteresting additional matter to bring forward, even in some of the\r\nmost elaborate parts of it. His account of the arts might also be\r\nimproved; although in commerce, manners and customs, I think he has\r\ndone as much, and as well, as could reasonably be expected. I\r\nquestion, however, whether his work, from the plan upon which it is\r\nexecuted, will ever become so popular as its fondest admirers seem to\r\nhope.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. You are to consider, Philemon, that in the execution of such\r\nan important whole, in the erection of so immense a fabric, some parts\r\nmust necessarily be finished in a less workman-like style than others.\r\nAnd, after all, there is a good deal of caprice in our criticisms. You\r\nfancy, in this fabric (if I may be allowed to go on with my simile), a\r\nboudoir, a hall, or a staircase; and fix a critical eye upon a recess\r\nbadly contrived, an oval badly turned, or pillars weakly put\r\ntogether:--the builder says, Don't look at these parts of the fabric\r\nwith such fastidious nicety; they are subordinate. If my boudoir will\r\nhold a moderate collection of old-fashioned Dresden China, if my\r\nstaircase be stout enough to conduct you and your company to the upper\r\nrooms; and, if my hall be spacious enough to hold the hats, umbrellas\r\nand walking-sticks of your largest dinner-party, they answer the ends\r\nproposed:--unless you would _live_ in your boudoir, upon your\r\nstaircase, or within your hall! The fact then is, you, Philemon,\r\nprefer the boudoir, and might, perhaps, improve upon its structure;\r\nbut, recollect, there are places in a house of equal, or perhaps more,\r\nconsequence than this beloved boudoir. Now, to make the obvious\r\napplication to the work which has given rise to this wonderful stretch\r\nof imagination on my part:--Dr. Henry is the builder, and his history\r\nis the building, in question: in the latter he had to put together,\r\nwith skill and credit, a number of weighty parts, of which the \"_Civil\r\nand Ecclesiastical_\" is undoubtedly the most important to the\r\ngenerality of readers. But one of these component parts was the _The\r\nHistory of Learning and of Learned Men_; which its author probably\r\nthought of subordinate consequence, or in the management of which, to\r\nallow you the full force of your objection, he was not so well\r\nskilled. Yet, still, never before having been thus connected with such\r\na building, it was undoubtedly a delightful acquisition; and I\r\nquestion whether, if it had been more elaborately executed--if it had\r\nexhibited all the fret-work and sparkling points which you seem to\r\nconceive necessary to its completion; I question, whether the\r\npopularity of the work would have been even so great as it is, and as\r\nit unquestionably merits to be! A few passionately-smitten literary\r\nantiquaries are not, perhaps, the fittest judges of such a production.\r\nTo be generally useful and profitable should be the object of every\r\nauthor of a similar publication; and as far as candour and liberality\r\nof sentiment, an unaffected and manly style, accompanied with weighty\r\nmatter, extensive research, and faithful quotation, render a work\r\nnationally valuable--the work of Dr. Henry, on these grounds, is an\r\nornament and honour to his country.\r\n\r\nPHIL. Yet I wish he had rambled (if you will permit me so to speak) a\r\nlittle more into book-men and book-anecdotes.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. You may indulge this wish very innocently; but, certainly, you\r\nought not to censure Dr. Henry for the omission of such minutiæ.\r\n\r\nLIS. Does he ever quote Clement, De Bure, or Panzer?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Away with such bibliomaniacal frenzy! He quotes solid, useful\r\nand respectable authorities; chiefly our old and most valuable\r\nhistorians. No writer before him ever did them so much justice, or\r\ndisplayed a more familiar acquaintance with them.\r\n\r\nLIS. Do pray give us, Lysander, some little sketches of\r\nbook-characters--which, I admit, did not enter into the plan of Dr.\r\nHenry's excellent work. As I possess the original quarto edition of\r\nthis latter, bound in Russia, you will not censure me for a want of\r\nrespect towards the author.\r\n\r\nPHIL. I second Lisardo's motion; although I fear the evening presses\r\ntoo hard upon us to admit of much present discussion.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Nothing--(speaking most unaffectedly from my heart) nothing\r\naffords me sincerer pleasure than to do any thing in my power which\r\nmay please such cordial friends as yourselves. My pretensions to that\r\nsort of antiquarian _knowledge_, which belongs to the history of\r\nbook-collectors, are very poor, as you well know,--they being greatly\r\neclipsed by my _zeal_ in the same cause. But, as I love my country and\r\nmy country's literature, so no conversation or research affords me a\r\nlivelier pleasure than that which leads me to become better acquainted\r\nwith the ages which have gone by; with the great and good men of old;\r\nwho have found the most imperishable monuments of their fame in the\r\nsympathizing hearts of their successors. But I am wandering--\r\n\r\nLIS. Go on as you please, dear Lysander; for I have been too much\r\nindebted to your conversation ever to suppose it could diverge into\r\nany thing censoriously irrelevant. Begin where and when you please.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. I assure you it is far from my intention to make any formal\r\nexordium, even if I knew the exact object of your request.\r\n\r\nPHIL. Tell us all about book-collecting and BIBLIOMANIACS in this\r\ncountry--\r\n\r\nLIS. \"Commençez au commençement\"--as the French adage is.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. In sober truth, you impose upon me a pretty tough task! \"One\r\nThousand and One Nights\" would hardly suffice for the execution of it;\r\nand now, already, I see the owl flying across the lawn to take her\r\nstation in the neighbouring oak; while even the middle ground of\r\nyonder landscape is veiled in the blue haziness of evening. Come a\r\nshort half hour, and who, unless the moon befriend him, can see the\r\noutline of the village church? Thus gradually and imperceptibly, but\r\nthus surely, succeeds age to youth--death to life--eternity to\r\ntime!--You see in what sort of mood I am for the performance of my\r\npromise?\r\n\r\nLIS. Reserve these meditations for your pillow, dear Lysander: and\r\nnow, again I entreat you--\"commençez au commençement.\"\r\n\r\nPHIL. Pray make a beginning only: the conclusion shall be reserved, as\r\na desert, for Lorenzo's dinner to-morrow.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Lest I should be thought coquettish, I will act with you as I\r\nhave already done; and endeavour to say something which may gratify\r\nyou as before.\r\n\r\nIt has often struck me my dear friends, continued Lysander--(in a\r\nbalanced attitude, and seeming to bring quietly together all his\r\nscattered thoughts upon the subject) it has often struck me that few\r\nthings have operated more unfavourably towards the encouragement of\r\nlearning, and of book-collecting, than the universal passion for\r\n_chivalry_--which obtained towards the middle ages; while, on the\r\nother hand, a _monastic life_ seems to have excited a love of\r\nretirement, meditation, and reading.[210] I admit readily, that,\r\nconsidering the long continuance of the monastic orders, and that\r\nalmost all intellectual improvement was confined within the cloister,\r\na very slow and partial progress was made in literature. The system of\r\neducation was a poor, stinted, and unproductive one. Nor was it till\r\nafter the enterprising activity of Poggio had succeeded in securing a\r\nfew precious remains of classical antiquity,[211] that the wretched\r\nindolence of the monastic life began to be diverted from a constant\r\nmeditation upon \"antiphoners, grailes, and psalters,\"[212] towards\r\nsubjects of a more generally interesting nature. I am willing to admit\r\nevery degree of merit to the manual dexterity of the cloistered\r\nstudent. I admire his snow-white vellum missals, emblazoned with gold,\r\nand sparkling with carmine and ultramarine blue. By the help of the\r\nmicroscopic glass, I peruse his diminutive penmanship, executed with\r\nthe most astonishing neatness and regularity; and often wish in my\r\nheart that our typographers printed with ink as glossy black as that\r\nwhich they sometimes used in their writing. I admire all this; and now\r\nand then, for a guinea or two, I purchase a specimen of such\r\nmarvellous leger-de-main: but the book, when purchased, is to me a\r\nsealed book. And yet, Philemon, I blame not the individual, but the\r\nage; not the task, but the task-master; for surely the same exquisite\r\nand unrivalled beauty would have been exhibited in copying an ode of\r\nHorace, or a dictum of Quintilian. Still, however, you may say that\r\nthe intention, in all this, was pure and meritorious; for that such a\r\nsystem excited insensibly a love of quiet, domestic order, and\r\nseriousness: while those counsels and regulations which punished a\r\n\"Clerk for being a hunter,\" and restricted \"the intercourse of\r\nConcubines,\"[213] evinced a spirit of jurisprudence which would have\r\ndone justice to any age. Let us allow, then, if you please, that a\r\nlove of book-reading, and of book-collecting, was a meritorious trait\r\nin the monastic life; and that we are to look upon old abbies and\r\nconvents as the sacred depositories of the literature of past ages.\r\nWhat can you say in defence of your times of beloved chivalry?\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 210: As early as the sixth century commenced the\r\n     custom, in some monasteries, of copying ancient books and\r\n     composing new ones. It was the usual, and even only,\r\n     employment of the first monks of Marmoutier. A monastery\r\n     without a library was considered as a fort or a camp\r\n     deprived of the necessary articles for its defence:\r\n     \"claustrum sine armario, quasi castrum sine armentario.\"\r\n     Peignot, _Dict. de Bibliolog._, vol. i., 77. I am fearful\r\n     that this good old bibliomanical custom of keeping up the\r\n     credit of their libraries among the monks had ceased--at\r\n     least in the convent of Romsey, in Hampshire--towards the\r\n     commencement of the sixteenth century. One would think that\r\n     the books had been there disposed of in bartering for\r\n     _strong liquors_; for at a visitation by Bishop Fox, held\r\n     there in 1506, Joyce Rows, the abbess, is accused of\r\n     _immoderate drinking_, especially in the night time; and of\r\n     inviting the nuns to her chamber every evening, for the\r\n     purpose of these excesses, \"post completorium.\" What is\r\n     frightful to add,--\"this was a rich convent, and filled with\r\n     ladies of the best families.\" See Warton's cruel note in his\r\n     _Life of Sir Thomas Pope_, p. 25, edit. 1772. A\r\n     tender-hearted bibliomaniac cannot but feel acutely on\r\n     reflecting upon the many beautifully-illuminated vellum\r\n     books which were, in all probability, exchanged for these\r\n     inebriating gratifications! To balance this unfavourable\r\n     account read Hearne's remark about the libraries in ancient\r\n     monasteries, in the sixth volume of _Leland's Collectanea_,\r\n     p. 86-7, edit. 1774: and especially the anecdotes and\r\n     authorities stated by Dr. Henry in book iii., chap, iv.,\r\n     sec. 1.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 211: See the first volume of Mr. Roscoe's _Lorenzo\r\n     de Medici_; and the Rev.

Shew me in what respect the gallant spirit of an ancient knight\r\nwas hostile to the cultivation of the belles-lettres?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Most readily. Look at your old romances, and what is the\r\nsystem of education--of youthful pursuits--which they in general\r\ninculcate? Intrigue and bloodshed.[214] Examine your favourite new\r\nedition of the _Fabliaux et Contes_ of the middle ages, collected by\r\nBarbazan! However the editor may say that \"though some of these pieces\r\nare a little too free, others breathe a spirit of morality and\r\nreligion--\"[215] the main scope of the poems, taken collectively, is\r\nthat which has just been mentioned. But let us come to particulars.\r\nWhat is there in the _Ordene de Chevalerie_, or _Le Castoiement d'un\r\nPere à son fils_ (pieces in which one would expect a little\r\nseriousness of youthful instruction), that can possibly excite a love\r\nof reading, book-collecting, or domestic quiet?

The which\r\n     OLIVER and ARTHUR made for to be cried, that three\r\n     aventurous knights should just against all comers, the which\r\n     should find them there the first day of the lusty month of\r\n     May, in complete harness, for to just against their\r\n     adversaries with sharp spears. And the said three champions\r\n     should just three days in three colours: that is to wit, in\r\n     black, grey and violet--and their shields of the same hue;\r\n     and them to find on the third day at the lists. There justed\r\n     divers young knights of the king's court: and the justing\r\n     was more _asperer_ of those young knights than ever they had\r\n     seen any in that country. And, by the report of the ladies,\r\n     they did so knightly, every one, that it was not possible\r\n     for to do better, as them thought, by their strokes. But,\r\n     above all other, OLIVER and ARTHUR (his loyal fellow) had\r\n     the _bruit_ and _loos_. The justing endured long: it was\r\n     marvel to see the hideous strokes that they dealt; for the\r\n     justing had not finished so soon but that the night\r\n     _separed_ them. Nevertheless, the adversary party abode\r\n     'till the torches were light. But the ladies and\r\n     _damoyselles_, that of all the justing time had been there,\r\n     were weary, and would depart. Wherefore the justers departed\r\n     in likewise, and went and disarmed them for to come to the\r\n     banquet or feast. And when that the banquet was finished and\r\n     done, the dances began. And there came the king and the\r\n     valiant knights of arms, for to enquire of the ladies and\r\n     _damoyselles_, who that had best borne him as for that day.\r\n     The ladies, which were all of one accord and agreement, said\r\n     that Oliver and Arthur had surmounted all the best doers of\r\n     that _journey_. And by cause that Oliver and Arthur were\r\n     both of one party, and that they could find but little\r\n     difference between them of knighthood, they knew not the\r\n     which they might sustain. But, in the end, they said that\r\n     Arthur had done right valiantly: nevertheless, they said\r\n     that Oliver had done best unto their seeming. And therefore\r\n     it was concluded that the _pryce_ should be given unto\r\n     Oliver, as for the best of them of within. And another noble\r\n     knight, of the realm of Algarbe, that came with the queen,\r\n     had the pryce of without. When the pryce of the juste that\r\n     had been made was brought before Oliver, by two fair\r\n     _damoyselles_, he waxed all red, and was ashamed at that\r\n     present time; and said that it was of their bounty for to\r\n     give him the pryce, and not of his desert: nevertheless, he\r\n     received it; and, as it was of custom in guerdoning them, he\r\n     kissed them.

Pray dwell no longer upon such barbarous heroism! We admit that\r\n_Monachism_ may have contributed towards the making of bibliomaniacs\r\nmore effectually than _Chivalry_. Now proceed--\r\n\r\nThese words had hardly escaped Lisardo, when the arrival of my worthy\r\nneighbour NARCOTTUS (who lived by the parsonage house), put a stop to\r\nthe discourse. Agreeably to a promise which I had made him three days\r\nbefore, he came to play a GAME OF CHESS with Philemon; who, on his\r\npart, although a distinguished champion at this head-distracting game,\r\ngave way rather reluctantly to the performance of the promise: for\r\nLYSANDER was now about to enter upon the history of the Bibliomania in\r\nthis country. The Chess-board, however was brought out; and down to\r\nthe contest the combatants sat--while Lisardo retired to one corner of\r\nthe room to examine thoroughly his newly-purchased volumes, and\r\nLysander took down a prettily executed 8vo. volume upon the Game of\r\nChess, printed at Cheltenham, about six years ago, and composed \"by an\r\namateur.\" While we were examining, in this neat work, an account of\r\nthe numerous publications upon the Game of Chess, in various countries\r\nand languages, and were expressing our delight in reading anecdotes\r\nabout eminent chess players, Lisardo was carefully packing up his\r\nbooks, as he expected his servant every minute to take them away. The\r\nservant shortly arrived, and upon his expressing his inability to\r\ncarry the entire packet--\"Here,\" exclaimed Lisardo, \"do you take the\r\nquartos, and follow me; who will march onward with the octavos.\" This\r\nwas no sooner said than our young bibliomaniacal convert gave De Bure,\r\nGaignat, and La Valliere, a vigorous swing across his shoulders; while\r\nthe twenty quarto volumes of Clement and Panzer were piled, like \"Ossa\r\nupon Pelion,\" upon those of his servant--and\r\n\r\n     \"Light of foot, and light of heart\"\r\n\r\nLisardo took leave of us 'till the morrow.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the chess combat continued with unabated spirit. Here\r\nPhilemon's king stood pretty firmly guarded by both his knights, one\r\ncastle, one bishop, and a body of common soldiers[218]--impenetrable\r\nas the Grecian phalanx, or Roman legion; while his queen had made a\r\nsly sortie to surprise the only surviving knight of Narcottus.\r\nNarcottus, on the other hand, was cautiously collecting his scattered\r\nfoot soldiers, and, with two bishops, and two castle-armed elephants,\r\nwere meditating a desperate onset to retrieve the disgrace of his lost\r\nqueen. An inadvertent remark from Lysander, concerning the antiquity\r\nof the game, attracted the attention of Philemon so much as to throw\r\nhim off his guard; while his queen, forgetful of her sex, and\r\nventuring unprotected, like Penthesilea of old, into the thickest of\r\nthe fight, was trampled under foot, without mercy,[219] by a huge\r\nelephant, carrying a castle of armed men upon his back. Shouts of\r\napplause, from Narcottus's men, rent the vaulted air; while grief and\r\nconsternation possessed the astonished army of Philemon. \"Away with\r\nyour antiquarian questions,\" exclaimed the latter, looking sharply at\r\nLysander: \"away with your old editions of the Game of Chess! The\r\nmoment is critical; and I fear the day may be lost. Now for desperate\r\naction!\" So saying, he bade the King exhort his dismayed subjects. His\r\nMajesty made a spirited oration; and called upon _Sir Launcelot_, the\r\nmost distinguished of the two Knights,[220] to be mindful of his own\r\nand of his country's honour: to spare the effusion of blood among his\r\nsubjects as much as possible; but rather to place victory or defeat in\r\nthe comparative skill of the officers: and, at all events, to rally\r\nround that throne which had conferred such high marks of distinction\r\nupon his ancestors. \"I needed not, gracious sire,\" replied Sir\r\nLauncelot--curbing in his mouth-foaming steed, and fixing his spear in\r\nthe rest--\"I needed not to be here reminded of your kindness to my\r\nforefathers, or of the necessity of doing every thing, at such a\r\ncrisis, beseeming the honour of a true round-table knight.--Yes,\r\ngracious sovereign, I swear to you by the love I bear to THE LADY OF\r\nTHE LAKE[221]--by the remembrance of the soft moments we have passed\r\ntogether in the honey-suckle bowers of her father--by all that an\r\nknight of chivalry is taught to believe the most sacred and binding--I\r\nswear that I will not return this day alive without the laurel of\r\nvictory entwined round my brow. Right well do I perceive that deeds\r\nand not words must save us now--let the issue of the combat prove my\r\nvalour and allegiance.\" Upon this, Sir Launcelot clapped spurs to his\r\nhorse, and after driving an unprotected Bishop into the midst of the\r\nfoot-soldiers, who quickly took him prisoner, he sprang forward, with\r\na lion-like nimbleness and ferocity, to pick out _Sir Galaad_, the\r\nonly remaining knight in the adverse army, to single combat. Sir\r\nGalaad, strong and wary, like the Greenland bear when assailed by the\r\ndarts and bullets of our whale-fishing men, marked the fury of Sir\r\nLauncelot's course, and sought rather to present a formidable defence\r\nby calling to aid his elephants, than to meet such a champion\r\nsingle-handed. A shrill blast from his horn told the danger of his\r\nsituation, and the necessity of help. What should now be done? The\r\nunbroken ranks of Philemon's men presented a fearful front to the\r\nadvance of the elephants, and the recent capture of a venerable bishop\r\nhad made the monarch, on Narcottus's side, justly fearful of risking\r\nthe safety of his empire by leaving himself wholly without episcopal\r\naid. Meanwhile the progress of Sir Launcelot was marked with blood;\r\nand he was of necessity compelled to slaughter a host of common men,\r\nwho stood thickly around Sir Galaad, resolved to conquer or die by his\r\nside. At length, as Master Laneham aptly expresses it, \"get they\r\ngrysly together.\"[222] The hostile leaders met; there was neither time\r\nnor disposition for parley. Sir Galaad threw his javelin with\r\nwell-directed fury; which, flying within an hair's breadth of Sir\r\nLauncelot's shoulder, passed onward, and, grazing the cheek of a foot\r\nsoldier, stood quivering in the sand. He then was about to draw his\r\nponderous sword--but the tremendous spear of Sir Launcelot, whizzing\r\nstrongly in the air, passed through his thickly quilted belt, and,\r\nburying itself in his bowels, made Sir Galaad to fall breathless from\r\nhis horse. Now might you hear the shouts of victory on one side, and\r\nthe groans of the vanquished on the other; or, as old Homer expresses\r\nit,\r\n\r\n     Victors and vanquished shouts promiscuous rise.\r\n     With streams of blood the slippery fields are dyed,\r\n     And slaughtered heroes swell the dreadful tide.\r\n\r\n     _Iliad_ [passim].\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 218: \"Whilst there are strong, able, and active\r\n     men of the king's side, to defend his cause, there is no\r\n     danger of [this] misfortune.\" _Letter to the Craftsman on\r\n     the Game of Chess_, p. 13.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 219: \"When therefore the men of one party attack\r\n     those of the other, though their spleen at first may only\r\n     seem bent against a _Bishop_, a _Knight_, or an inferior\r\n     officer; yet, if successful in their attacks on that servant\r\n     of the king, they never stop there: they come afterwards to\r\n     think themselves strong enough even to attack _the Queen_,\"\r\n     &c. _The same_, p. 12.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 220: \"_The Knight_ (whose steps, as your\r\n     correspondent justly observes, are not of an ordinary kind,\r\n     and often surprise men who oppose him) is of great use in\r\n     extricating _the King_ out of those difficulties in which\r\n     his foes endeavour to entangle him.--He is a man whom a wise\r\n     player makes great use of in these exigences, and who\r\n     oftenest defeats the shallow schemes and thin artifices of\r\n     unskilful antagonists.

Elizabeth at Kenilworth Castle: A.D. 1575, edit. 1784,\r\n     p. 12. Yet more famous, I add, in a poem under this express\r\n     title, by WALTER SCOTT, 1810.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 222: See the authority (p. 40) quoted in the note\r\n     at page 157, ante.]\r\n\r\nAnd, truly, the army of Narcottus seemed wasted with a great\r\nslaughter: yet on neither side, had the monarch been _checked_, so as\r\nto be put in personal danger! \"While there is life there is hope,\"\r\nsaid the surviving Bishop[223] on the side of Narcottus: who now\r\ntaking upon him the command of the army, and perceiving Sir Launcelot\r\nto be pretty nearly exhausted with fatigue, and wantonly exposing\r\nhis person, ordered the men at arms to charge him briskly on all\r\nsides; while his own two castles kept a check upon the remaining\r\ncastle, knight, and bishop of the opposite army: also, he exhorted the\r\nking to make a feint, as if about to march onwards. Sir Launcelot, on\r\nperceiving the movement of the monarch, sprang forward to make him a\r\nprisoner; but he was surprised by an elephant in ambuscade, from whose\r\ncastle-bearing back a well-shot arrow pierced his corslet, and\r\ninflicted a mortal wound. He fell; but, in falling, he seemed to smile\r\neven sweetly, as he thought upon the noble speech of Sir Bohort[224]\r\nover the dead body of his illustrious ancestor, of the same name; and,\r\nexhorting his gallant men to revenge his fall, he held the handle of\r\nhis sword firmly, till his whole frame was stiffened in death. And now\r\nthe battle was renewed with equal courage and equal hopes of victory\r\non both sides: but the loss of the flower of their armies, and\r\nespecially of their beloved spouses, had heavily oppressed the adverse\r\nmonarchs: who, retiring to a secured spot, bemoaned in secret the\r\nhapless deaths of their queens, and bitterly bewailed that injudicious\r\nlaw which, of necessity, so much exposed their fair persons, by giving\r\nthem such an unlimited power. The fortune of the day, therefore,\r\nremained in the hands of the respective commanders; and if the knight\r\nand bishop, on Philemon's side, had not contested about superiority of\r\nrule, the victory had surely been with Philemon. But the strife of\r\nthese commanders threw every thing into confusion. The men, after\r\nbeing trampled upon by the elephants of Narcottus, left their king\r\nexposed, without the power of being aided by his castle. An error so\r\nfatal was instantly perceived by the bishop of Narcottus's shattered\r\narmy; who, like another Ximenes,[225] putting himself at the head of\r\nhis forces, and calling upon his men resolutely to march onwards, gave\r\norders for the elephants to be moved cautiously at a distance, and to\r\nlose no opportunity of making the opposite monarch prisoner. Thus,\r\nwhile he charged in front, and captured, with his own hands, the\r\nremaining adverse knight, his men kept the adverse bishop from sending\r\nreinforcements; and Philemon's elephant not having an opportunity of\r\nsweeping across the plain to come to the timely aid of the\r\nking,[226] the victory was speedily obtained, for the men upon the\r\nbacks of Narcottus's elephants kept up so tremendous a discharge of\r\narrows that the monarch was left without a single attendant: and, of\r\nnecessity, was obliged to submit to the generosity of his captors.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 223: \"I think _the Bishops_ extremely considerable\r\n     throughout the whole game. One quality too they have, which\r\n     is peculiar to themselves; this is that, throughout the\r\n     whole game, they have a _steadiness_ in their conduct,\r\n     superior to men of any other denomination on the board; as\r\n     they never change their colour, but always pursue the path\r\n     in which they set out.\" _The same_ (vid. 206-7) p. 20.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 224: This truly chivalrous speech may be seen\r\n     extracted in Mr. Burnet's _Specimens of English Prose\r\n     Writers_, vol. i., 269.

CARDINAL XIMENES was the promoter\r\n     and patron of the celebrated Complutensian Polyglott Bible;\r\n     concerning which I have already submitted some account to\r\n     the public in my _Introduction to the Classics_, vol. i.,\r\n     pp. 7, 8. His political abilities and personal courage have\r\n     been described by Dr. Robertson (in his history of Charles\r\n     V.), with his usual ability. We have here only to talk of\r\n     him as connected with books. Mallinkrot and Le Long have\r\n     both preserved the interesting anecdote which is related by\r\n     his first biographer, Alvaro Gomez, concerning the\r\n     completion of the forementioned Polyglott. \"I have often\r\n     heard John Brocarius (says Gomez) son of Arnoldus Brocarius,\r\n     who printed the Polyglott, tell his friends that, when his\r\n     father had put the finishing stroke to the last volume, he\r\n     deputed _him_ to carry it to the Cardinal. John Brocarius\r\n     was then a lad; and, having dressed himself in an elegant\r\n     suit of clothes, he gravely approached Ximenes, and\r\n     delivered the volume into his hands. 'I render thanks to\r\n     thee, oh God!' exclaimed the Cardinal, 'that thou hast\r\n     protracted my life to the completion of these biblical\r\n     labours.' Afterwards, when conversing with his friends,\r\n     Ximenes would often observe that the surmounting of the\r\n     various difficulties of his political situation did not\r\n     afford him half the satisfaction which he experienced from\r\n     the finishing of his Polyglott. He died in the year 1517,\r\n     not many weeks after the last volume was published.\" Gomez,\r\n     or Gomecius's work \"_de rebus gestis, à Francisco Ximenio\r\n     Cisnerio Archiepiscopo Complut_,\" 1569, fol., is a book of\r\n     very uncommon occurrence. It is much to be wished that Lord\r\n     Holland, or Mr. Southey, would give us a life of this\r\n     celebrated political character: as the biographies of\r\n     Flechier and Marsolier seem miserably defective, and the\r\n     sources of Gomez to have been but partially consulted. But I\r\n     must not let slip this opportunity of commemorating the\r\n     book-reputation of XIMENES, without making the reader\r\n     acquainted with two other singularly scarce and curious\r\n     productions of the press, which owe their birth to the\r\n     bibliomanical spirit of our Cardinal. I mean the \"_Missale\r\n     mixtum secundun [Transcriber's Note: secundum] regulum B.\r\n     Isidori, dictum Mozarabes, cum præfat._\" _A. Ortiz._ Toleti,\r\n     1500, fol. and the \"_Breviarium, mixtum,\" &c._ _Mozarabes._\r\n     Toleti, 1502, fol.: of the former of which there was a copy\r\n     in the Harleian collection; as the ensuing interesting note,\r\n     in the catalogue of Lord Harley's books, specifies. I shall\r\n     give it without abridgment: \"This is the scarcest book in\r\n     the whole Harleian collection. At the end of it are the\r\n     following words, which deserve to be inserted\r\n     here:--Adlaudem Omnipotentis Dei, nec non Virginis Mariæ\r\n     Matris ejus, omnium sanctorum sanctarumq; expletum est\r\n     Missale mixtum secundum regulam beati Isidori dictum\r\n     Mozarabes: maxima cum diligentia perlectum et emendatum, per\r\n     Reverendum in utroq; Jure Doctorem Dominum Alfonsum Ortiz,\r\n     Canonicum Toletanum.

The Moors afterwards committing great ravages in\r\n     Spain, destroying the churches, and throwing every thing\r\n     there, both civil and sacred, into confusion, all St.\r\n     Isidore's missals, excepting those in the city of Toledo,\r\n     were lost. But those were preserved even after the Moors had\r\n     made themselves masters of that city; since they left six of\r\n     the churches there to the Christians, and granted them the\r\n     free exercise of their religion. Alphonsus the Sixth, many\r\n     ages afterwards, expelled the Moors from Toledo, and ordered\r\n     the Roman missal to be used in those churches where St.\r\n     Isidore's missal had been in vogue, ever since the council\r\n     above-mentioned. But the people of Toledo insisting that\r\n     their missal was drawn up by the most ancient bishops,\r\n     revised and corrected by St. Isidore, proved to be the best\r\n     by the great number of saints who had followed it, and been\r\n     preserved during the whole time of the Moorish government in\r\n     Spain, he could not bring his project to bear without great\r\n     difficulty. In short, the contest between the Roman and\r\n     Toletan missals came to that height that, according to the\r\n     genius of the age, it was decided by a single combat,\r\n     wherein the champion of the Toletan missal proved\r\n     victorious. But King Alphonsus, say some of the Spanish\r\n     writers, not being satisfied with this, which he considered\r\n     as the effect of chance only, ordered a fast to be\r\n     proclaimed, and a great fire to be then made; into which,\r\n     after the king and people had prayed fervently to God for\r\n     his assistance in this affair, both the missals were thrown;\r\n     but the Toletan only escaped the violence of the flames.\r\n     This, continue the same authors, made such an impression\r\n     upon the king that he permitted the citizens of Toledo to\r\n     use their own missal in those churches that had been granted\r\n     the Christians by the Moors. However, the copies of this\r\n     missal grew afterwards so scarce, that Cardinal Ximenes\r\n     found it extremely difficult to meet with one of them: which\r\n     induced him to order this impression, and to build a chapel,\r\n     in which this service was chanted every day, as it had at\r\n     first been by the ancient Christians. But, notwithstanding\r\n     this, the copies of the Toletan missal are become now so\r\n     exceeding rare that it is at present almost in as much\r\n     danger of being buried in oblivion as it was when committed\r\n     to the press by Cardinal Ximenes.\" _Bibl. Harl._, vol. iii.,\r\n     p. 117. But let the reader consult the more extended details\r\n     of De Bure (_Bibl. Instruct._, vol. i., no. 210, 211),\r\n     and De La Serna Santander (_Dict. Chois. Bibliogr. du_ xv.\r\n     _Siecle_, part iii., p. 178); also the very valuable notice\r\n     of Vogt; _Cat. Libror. Rarior._, p. 591; who mention a fine\r\n     copy of the missal and breviary, each struck off UPON\r\n     VELLUM, in the collegiate church of St. Ildefonso. If I\r\n     recollect rightly, Mr. Edwards informed me that an Italian\r\n     Cardinal was in possession of a similar copy of each. This\r\n     missal was republished at Rome, with a capital preface and\r\n     learned notes, by Lesleus, a Jesuit, in 1755, 4to.: and\r\n     Lorenzana, archbishop of Toledo, republished the breviary in\r\n     a most splendid manner at Madrid, in 1788. Both these\r\n     re-impressions are also scarce. I know not whether the late\r\n     king of Spain ever put his design into execution of giving a\r\n     new edition of these curious religious volumes; some ancient\r\n     MSS. of which had been carefully collated by Burriel.\r\n     Consult Osmont's _Dict. Typog._, vol. i., p. 477; _Cat. de\r\n     Gaignat_, nos. 179, 180; _Cat. de la Valliere_, nos.\r\n     271, 272; _Bibl. Solger._, vol. ii. no. 1280; and _Bibl.\r\n     Colbert_, nos. 342, 366. Having expatiated thus much, and\r\n     perhaps tediously, about these renowned volumes, let me\r\n     introduce to the notice of the heraldic reader the _Coat of\r\n     Arms_ of the equally renowned Cardinal--of whose genuine\r\n     editions of the Mozarabic Missal and Breviary my eyes were\r\n     highly gratified with a sight, in the exquisite library of\r\n     Earl Spencer, at Althorp.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration]]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 226: Of the _Tower_ or _Rook_ (or _Elephant_) one\r\n     may indeed--to speak in the scripture style--(and properly\r\n     speaking, considering its situation) call this piece \"the\r\n     head stone of the corner.\" There are two of them; and,\r\n     whilst they remain firm, his majesty is ever in safety. The\r\n     common enemies, therefore, of them and their king watch\r\n     their least motion very narrowly, and try a hundred tricks\r\n     to decoy them from the king's side, by feints, false alarms,\r\n     stumbling blocks, or any other method that can be contrived\r\n     to divert them from their duty. The _same_, p. 15. (vide.\r\n     159, ante.)]\r\n\r\nThus ended one of the most memorable chess contests upon record. Not\r\nmore stubbornly did the Grecians and Romans upon Troy's plain, or the\r\nEnglish and French upon Egypt's shores, contend for the palm of\r\nvictory, than did Philemon and Narcottus compel their respective\r\nforces to signalize themselves in this hard-fought game. To change the\r\nsimile for a more homely one; no Northamptonshire hunt was ever more\r\nvigorously kept up; and had it not been (at least so Philemon\r\nthought!) for the inadvertent questions of Lysander, respecting the\r\nantiquity of the amusement, an easy victory would have been obtained\r\nby my guest over my neighbour. Lysander, with his usual politeness,\r\ntook all the blame upon himself. Philemon felt, as all chess-combatants\r\nfeel upon defeat, peevish and vexed. But the admirably well adapted\r\nconversation of Lysander, and the natural diffidence of Narcottus,\r\nserved to smooth Philemon's ruffled plumage; and at length diffused\r\no'er his countenance his natural glow of good humour.\r\n\r\nIt was now fast advancing towards midnight; when Narcottus withdrew to\r\nhis house, and my guests to their chambers.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow came; and with the morrow came composure and hilarity in the\r\ncountenances of my guests. The defeat of the preceding evening was no\r\nlonger thought of; except that Philemon betrayed some little marks of\r\nirritability on Lysander's shewing him the fac-simile wood-cuts of the\r\npieces and men in Caxton's edition of the game of chess, which are\r\npublished in the recent edition of the Typographical Antiquities of\r\nour country.\r\n\r\nLisardo visited us betimes. His countenance, on his entrance gave\r\nindication of vexation and disappointment--as well it might; for, on\r\nhis return home the preceding evening, he found the following note\r\nfrom Lorenzo:--\r\n\r\n\"My dear Lisardo;\r\n\r\nOur friend's visitors, Lysander and Philemon, are coming with their\r\nhost to eat old mutton, and drink old sherry, with me to-morrow; and\r\nafterwards to discuss subjects of bibliography. I do not ask you to\r\njoin them, because I know your thorough aversion to every thing\r\nconnected with such topics. Adieu!\r\n\r\nTruly yours,\r\n\r\nLORENZO.\"\r\n\r\n\"Little,\" exclaimed Lisardo, \"does he know of my conversion. I'll join\r\nyou uninvited; and abide by the consequences.\"\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock we set off, in company with Lisardo, for Lorenzo's\r\ndinner. I need hardly add that the company of the latter was cordially\r\nwelcomed by our host; who, before the course of pastry was cleared\r\naway, proposed a sparkling bumper of Malmsey madeira, to commemorate\r\nhis conversion to Bibliomaniacism. By half-past-five we were ushered\r\ninto THE LIBRARY, to partake of a costly dessert of rock melons and\r\nHamburgh grapes, with all their appropriate embellishments of\r\nnectarines and nuts. Massive and curiously cut decanters, filled with\r\nthe genuine juice of the grape, strayed backwards and forwards upon\r\nthe table: and well-furnished minds, which could not refuse the luxury\r\nof such a feast, made every thing as pleasant as rational pleasure\r\ncould be.\r\n\r\nLIS. If Lorenzo have not any thing which he may conceive more\r\ninteresting to propose, I move that you, good Lysander, now resume the\r\ndiscussion of a subject which you so pleasantly commenced last night.\r\n\r\nPHIL. I rise to second the motion.\r\n\r\nLOREN. And I, to give it every support in my power.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. There is no resisting such adroitly levelled attacks. Do pray\r\ntell me what it is you wish me to go on with?\r\n\r\nPHIL. The history of book-collecting and of book-collectors in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nLIS. The history of BIBLIOMANIA, if you please.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. You are madder than the maddest of book-collectors, Lisardo.\r\nBut I will gossip away upon the subjects as well as I am able.\r\n\r\nI think we left off with an abuse of the anti-bibliomaniacal powers of\r\nchivalry. Let us pursue a more systematic method; and begin, as\r\nLisardo says, \"at the beginning.\"\r\n\r\nIn the plan which I may pursue, you must forgive me, my friends, if\r\nyou find it desultory and irregular: and, as a proof of the sincerity\r\nof your criticism, I earnestly beg that, like the chivalrous judge, of\r\nwhom mention was made last night, you will cry out \"_Ho!_\" when you\r\nwish me to cease. But where shall we begin? From what period shall we\r\ntake up the history of BOOKISM (or, if you please, BIBLIOMANIA) in\r\nthis country? Let us pass over those long-bearded gentlemen called the\r\nDruids; for in the various hypotheses which sagacious antiquaries have\r\nadvanced upon their beloved _Stone-henge_, none, I believe, are to be\r\nfound wherein the traces of a _Library_, in that vast ruin, are\r\npretended to be discovered. As the Druids were sparing of their\r\nwriting,[227] they probably read the more; but whether they carried\r\ntheir books with them into trees, or made their pillows of them upon\r\nSalisbury-plain, tradition is equally silent. Let us therefore\r\npreserve the same prudent silence, and march on at once into the\r\nseventh, eighth, and ninth centuries; in which the learning of Bede,\r\nAlcuin, Erigena, and Alfred, strikes us with no small degree of\r\namazement. Yet we must not forget that their predecessor THEODORE,\r\narchbishop of Canterbury, was among the earliest book-collectors in\r\nthis country; for he brought over from Rome, not only a number of able\r\nprofessors, but a valuable collection of books.[228] Such, however,\r\nwas the scarcity of the book article, that Benedict Biscop (a founder\r\nof the monastery of Weremouth in Northumberland), a short time\r\nafter, made not fewer than five journeys to Rome to purchase books,\r\nand other necessary things for his monastery--for one of which books\r\nour immortal Alfred (a very _Helluo Librorum_! as you will presently\r\nlearn) gave afterwards as much land as eight ploughs could\r\nlabour.[229] We now proceed to BEDE; whose library I conjecture to\r\nhave been both copious and curious. What matin and midnight vigils\r\nmust this literary phenomenon have patiently sustained! What a full\r\nand variously furnished mind was his! Read the table of contents of\r\nthe eight folio volumes of the Cologne edition[230] of his works, as\r\ngiven by Dr. Henry in the appendix to the fourth volume of his history\r\nof our own country; and judge, however you may wish that the author\r\nhad gone less into abstruse and ponderous subjects, whether it was\r\nbarely possible to avoid falling upon such themes, considering the\r\ngross ignorance and strong bias of the age? Before this, perhaps, I\r\nought slightly to have noticed INA, king of the West Saxons, whose\r\nideas of the comforts of a monastery, and whose partiality to\r\n_handsome book-binding_, we may gather from a curious passage in\r\nStow's Chronicle or Annals.[231]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 227: Julius Cæsar tells us that they dared not to\r\n     commit their laws to writing. _De Bell.

Read, in particular, his celebrated letter\r\nto Charlemagne, which Dr. Henry has very ably translated; and see, how\r\nzealous he there shews himself to enrich the library of his\r\narchiepiscopal patron with good books and industrious students.[233]\r\nWell might Egbert be proud of his librarian: the first, I believe upon\r\nrecord, who has composed a catalogue[234] of books in Latin hexameter\r\nverse: and full reluctantly, I ween, did this librarian take leave of\r\nhis _Cell_ stored with the choicest volumes--as we may judge from his\r\npathetic address to it, on quitting England for France! If I recollect\r\nrightly, Mr. Turner's elegant translation[235] of it begins thus:\r\n\r\n     \"O my lov'd cell, sweet dwelling of my soul,\r\n     Must I for ever say, dear spot, farewell?\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 232: _Theatrum Chemicum_, proleg. sign.

But it is time to think of Johannes\r\nSCOTUS ERIGENA; the most facetious wag of his times, notwithstanding\r\nhis sirname of the _Wise_. \"While Great Britain (says Bale) was a prey\r\nto intestine wars, our philosopher was travelling quietly abroad\r\namidst the academic bowers of Greece;\"[236] and there I suppose he\r\nacquired, with his knowledge of the Greek language, a taste for\r\nbook-collecting and punning.[237] He was in truth a marvellous man; as\r\nwe may gather from the eulogy of him by Brucker.[238]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 236: Freely translated from his _Script. Brytan.\r\n     Illustr._, p. 124.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 237: Scot's celebrated reply to his patron and\r\n     admirer, Charles the Bald, was first made a popular story, I\r\n     believe, among the \"wise speeches\" in _Camden's Remaines_,\r\n     where it is thus told: \"Johannes Erigena, surnamed Scotus, a\r\n     man renowned for learning, sitting at the table, in respect\r\n     of his learning, with Charles the Bauld, Emperor and King of\r\n     France, behaved himselfe as a slovenly scholler, nothing\r\n     courtly; whereupon the Emperor asked him merrily, _Quid\r\n     interest inter Scotum et Sotum_? (what is there between a\r\n     Scot and a Sot?) He merrily, but yet malapertly answered,\r\n     '_Mensa_'--(the table): as though the emperor were the Sot\r\n     and he the Scot.\" p. 236. _Roger Hoveden_ is quoted as the\r\n     authority; but one would like to know where Hoveden got his\r\n     information, if Scotus has not mentioned the anecdote in his\r\n     own works? Since Camden's time, this facetious story has\r\n     been told by almost every historian and annalist.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 238: _Hist. Philosoph._, tom. 3, 616: as referred\r\n     to and quoted by Dr. Henry; whose account of our\r\n     book-champion, although less valuable than Mackenzie's, is\r\n     exceedingly interesting.]\r\n\r\nIn his celebrated work upon predestination, he maintained that\r\n\"material fire is no part of the torments of the damned;\"[239] a very\r\nsingular notion in those times of frightful superstition, when the\r\nminds of men were harrowed into despair by descriptions of hell's\r\ntorments--and I notice it here merely because I should like to be\r\ninformed in what curious book the said John Scotus Erigena acquired\r\nthe said notion? Let us now proceed to ALFRED; whose bust, I see,\r\nadorns that department of Lorenzo's library which is devoted to\r\nEnglish History.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 239: \"He endeavours to prove, in his logical way,\r\n     that the torments of the damned are mere privations of the\r\n     happiness, or the trouble of being deprived of it; so that,\r\n     according to him, material fire is no part of the torments\r\n     of the damned; that there is no other fire prepared for them\r\n     but the fourth element, through which the bodies of all men\r\n     must pass; but that the bodies of the elect are changed into\r\n     an ætherial nature, and are not subject to the power of\r\n     fire: whereas, on the contrary, the bodies of the wicked are\r\n     changed into air, and suffer torments by the fire, because\r\n     of their contrary qualities. And for this reason 'tis that\r\n     the demons, who had a body of an ætherial nature, were\r\n     massed with a body of air, that they might feel the fire.\"\r\n     _Mackenzie's Scottish Writers_: vol. i., 49. All this may be\r\n     ingenious enough; of its truth, a future state only will be\r\n     the evidence. Very different from that of Scotus is the\r\n     language of Gregory Narienzen: \"Exit in inferno frigus\r\n     insuperabile: ignis inextinguibilis: vermis immortalis:\r\n     fetor intollerabilis: tenebræ palpabiles: flagella\r\n     cedencium: horrenda visio demonum: desperatio omnium\r\n     bonorum.\" This I gather from the _Speculum Christiani_, fol.\r\n     37, printed by Machlinia, in the fifteenth century. The idea\r\n     is enlarged, and the picture aggravated, in a great number\r\n     of nearly contemporaneous publications, which will be\r\n     noticed, in part, hereafter. It is reported that some\r\n     sermons are about to be published, in which the personality\r\n     of Satan is questioned and denied. Thus having, by the\r\n     ingenuity of Scotus, got rid of the fire \"which is never\r\n     quenched\"--and, by means of modern scepticism, of the devil,\r\n     who is constantly \"seeking whom he may devour,\" we may go on\r\n     comfortably enough, without such awkward checks, in the\r\n     commission of every species of folly and crime!]\r\n\r\nThis great and good man, the boast and the bulwark of his country, was\r\ninstructed by his mother, from infancy, in such golden rules of virtue\r\nand good sense that one feels a regret at not knowing more of the\r\nfamily, early years, and character, of such a parent. As she told him\r\nthat \"a wise and a good man suffered no part of his time, but what is\r\nnecessarily devoted to bodily exercise, to pass in unprofitable\r\ninactivity\"--you may be sure that, with such book-propensities as he\r\nfelt, Alfred did not fail to make the most of the fleeting hour.\r\nAccordingly we find, from his ancient biographer, that he resolutely\r\nset to work by the aid of his wax tapers,[240] and produced some\r\nvery respectable compositions; for which I refer you to Mr. Turner's\r\nexcellent account of their author:[241] adding only that Alfred's\r\ntranslation of Boethius is esteemed his most popular performance.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 240: The story of the _wax tapers_ is related both\r\n     by Asser and William of Malmesbury, differing a little in\r\n     the unessential parts of it. It is this: Alfred commanded\r\n     six wax tapers to be made, each 12 inches in length, and of\r\n     as many ounces in weight. On these tapers he caused the\r\n     inches to be regularly marked; and having found that one\r\n     taper burnt just four hours, he committed them to the care\r\n     of the keepers of his chapel; who, from time to time gave\r\n     him notice how the hours went. But as in windy weather the\r\n     tapers were more wasted--to remedy this inconvenience, he\r\n     placed them in a kind of lanthorn, there being no glass to\r\n     be met with in his dominions. This event is supposed to have\r\n     occurred after Alfred had ascended the throne. In his\r\n     younger days, Asser tells us that he used to carry about, in\r\n     his bosom, day and night, a curiously-written volume of\r\n     hours, and psalms, and prayers, which by some are supposed\r\n     to have been the composition of Aldhelm. That Alfred had the\r\n     highest opinion of Aldhelm, and of his predecessors and\r\n     contemporaries, is indisputable; for in his famous letter to\r\n     Wulfseg, Bishop of London, he takes a retrospective view of\r\n     the times in which they lived, as affording \"churches and\r\n     monasteries filled with libraries of excellent books in\r\n     several languages.\" It is quite clear, therefore, that our\r\n     great Alfred was not a little infected with the\r\n     bibliomaniacal disease.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 241: _The History of the Anglo-Saxons_; by Sharon\r\n     Turner, F.S.A., 1808, 4to., 2 vols. This is the last and\r\n     best edition of a work which places Mr. Turner quite at the\r\n     head of those historians who have treated of the age of\r\n     Alfred.]\r\n\r\nAfter Alfred, we may just notice his son EDWARD, and his grandson\r\nATHELSTAN; the former of whom is supposed by Rous[242] (one of the\r\nmost credulous of our early historians) to have founded the University\r\nof Cambridge. The latter had probably greater abilities than his\r\npredecessor; and a thousand pities it is that William of Malmesbury\r\nshould have been so stern and squeamish as not to give us the\r\nsubstance of that old book, containing a life of Athelstan--which he\r\ndiscovered, and supposed to be coeval with the monarch--because,\r\nforsooth, the account was too uniformly flattering! Let me here,\r\nhowever, refer you to that beautiful translation of a Saxon ode,\r\nwritten in commemoration of Athelstan's decisive victory over the\r\nDanes of Brunamburg, which Mr. George Ellis has inserted in his\r\ninteresting volumes of _Specimens of the Early English Poets_:[243]\r\nand always bear in recollection that this monarch shewed the best\r\nproof of his attachment to books by employing as many learned men as\r\nhe could collect together for the purpose of translating the\r\nScriptures into his native Saxon tongue.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 242: Consult _Johannis Rossi Historia Regum\r\n     Angliæ; edit. Hearne_, 1745, 8vo., p. 96. This passage has\r\n     been faithfully translated by Dr. Henry. But let the lover\r\n     of knotty points in ancient matters look into Master Henry\r\n     Bynneman's prettily printed impression (A.D. 1568) of _De\r\n     Antiquitate Cantabrigiensis Academiæ_, p. 14--where the\r\n     antiquity of the University of Cambridge is gravely assigned\r\n     to the æra of Gurguntius's reign, A.M. 3588!--Nor must we\r\n     rest satisfied with the ingenious temerity of this author's\r\n     claims in favour of his beloved Cambridge, until we have\r\n     patiently examined Thomas Hearne's edition (A.D. 1720) of\r\n     _Thomæ Caii Vindic. Antiquitat. Acad. Oxon._: a work well\r\n     deserving of a snug place in the antiquary's cabinet.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 243: Edit. 1803, vol. i., p. 14.]\r\n\r\nLet us pass by that extraordinary scholar, courtier, statesman, and\r\nmonk--ST. DUNSTAN; by observing only that, as he was even more to\r\nEdgar than Wolsey was to Henry VIII.--so, if there had then been the\r\nsame love of literature and progress in civilization which marked the\r\nopening of the sixteenth century, Dunstan would have equalled, if not\r\neclipsed, Wolsey in the magnificence and utility of his institutions.\r\nHow many volumes of legends he gave to the library of Glastonbury, of\r\nwhich he was once the abbot, or to Canterbury, of which he was\r\nafterwards the Archbishop, I cannot take upon me to guess: as I have\r\nneither of Hearne's three publications[244] relating to Glastonbury in\r\nmy humble library.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 244: There is an ample Catalogue Raisonné of these\r\n     three scarce publications in the first volume of the\r\n     _British Bibliographer_. And to supply the deficiency of any\r\n     extract from them, in this place, take, kind-hearted reader,\r\n     the following--which I have gleaned from Eadmer's account of\r\n     St. Dunstan, as incorporated in Wharton's\r\n     _Anglia-Sacra_--and which would not have been inserted could\r\n     I have discovered any thing in the same relating to\r\n     book-presents to Canterbury cathedral.--\"Once on a time, the\r\n     king went a hunting early on Sunday morning; and requested\r\n     the Archbishop to postpone the celebration of the mass till\r\n     he returned. About three hours afterwards, Dunstan went into\r\n     the cathedral, put on his robes, and waited at the altar in\r\n     expectation of the king--where, reclining with his arms in a\r\n     devotional posture, he was absorbed in tears and prayers. A\r\n     gentle sleep suddenly possessed him; he was snatched up into\r\n     heaven; and in a vision associated with a company of angels,\r\n     whose harmonious voices, chaunting _Kyrie eleyson, Kyrie\r\n     eleyson, Kyrie eleyson_, burst upon his ravished ears! He\r\n     afterwards came to himself, and demanded whether or not the\r\n     king had arrived? Upon being answered in the negative, he\r\n     betook himself again to his prayers, and, after a short\r\n     interval, was once more absorbed in celestial extasies, and\r\n     heard a loud voice from heaven saying--_Ite, missa est_. He\r\n     had no sooner returned thanks to God for the same, when the\r\n     king's clerical attendants cried out that his majesty had\r\n     arrived, and entreated Dunstan to dispatch the mass. But he,\r\n     turning from the altar, declared that the mass had been\r\n     already celebrated; and that no other mass should be\r\n     performed during that day. Having put off his robes, he\r\n     enquired of his attendants into the truth of the\r\n     transaction; who told him what had happened. Then, assuming\r\n     a magisterial power, he prohibited the king, in future, from\r\n     hunting on a Sunday; and taught his disciples the _Kyrie\r\n     eleyson_, which he had heard in heaven: hence this\r\n     ejaculation, in many places, now obtains as a part of the\r\n     mass service.\" Tom. ii., p. 217. What shall we say to \"the\r\n     amiable and elegant Eadmer\" for this valuable piece of\r\n     biographical information?--\"The face of things was so\r\n     changed by the endeavours of Dunstan, and his master,\r\n     Ethelwald, that in a short time learning was generally\r\n     restored, and began to flourish. From this period, the\r\n     monasteries were the schools and seminaries of almost the\r\n     whole clergy, both secular and regular.\" Collier's _Eccles.\r\n     History_, vol. ii., p. 19, col. 2. That Glastonbury had many\r\n     and excellent books, vide Hearne's _Antiquities of\r\n     Glastonbury_; pp. LXXIV-VII. At Cambridge there is a\r\n     catalogue of the MSS. which were in Glastonbury library,\r\n     A.D. 1248.]\r\n\r\nWe may open the eleventh century with CANUTE; upon whose political\r\ntalents this is not the place to expatiate: but of whose\r\nbibliomaniacal character the illuminated MS. of _The Four Gospels_ in\r\nthe Danish tongue--now in the British Museum, and once this monarch's\r\nown book--leaves not the shadow of a doubt! From Canute we may proceed\r\nto notice that extraordinary literary triumvirate--Ingulph, Lanfranc,\r\nand Anselm. No rational man can hesitate about numbering them among\r\nthe very first rate book-collectors of that age. As to INGULPH, let us\r\nonly follow him, in his boyhood, in his removal from school to\r\ncollege: let us fancy we see him, with his _Quatuor Sermones_ on a\r\nSunday--and his _Cunabula Artis Grammaticæ_[245] on a week day--under\r\nhis arm: making his obeisance to Edgitha, the queen of Edward the\r\nConfessor, and introduced by her to William Duke of Normandy! Again,\r\nwhen he was placed, by this latter at the head of the rich abbey of\r\nCroyland, let us fancy we see him both adding to, and arranging, its\r\ncurious library[246]--before he ventured upon writing the history of\r\nthe said abbey. From Ingulph we go to LANFRANC; who, in his earlier\r\nyears, gratified his book appetites in the quiet and congenial\r\nseclusion of his little favourite abbey in Normandy: where he\r\nafterwards opened a school, the celebrity of which was acknowledged\r\nthroughout Europe. From being a pedagogue, let us trace him in his\r\nvirtuous career to the primacy of England; and when we read of his\r\nstudious and unimpeachable behaviour, as head of the see of\r\nCanterbury,[247] let us acknowledge that a love of books and of mental\r\ncultivation is among the few comforts in this world of which neither\r\ncraft nor misfortune can deprive us. To Lanfranc succeeded, in\r\nbook-fame and in professional elevation, his disciple ANSELM; who was\r\n\"lettered and chaste of his childhood,\" says Trevisa:[248] but who was\r\nbetter suited to the cloister than to the primacy. For, although, like\r\nWulston, Bishop of Worcester, he might have \"sung a long mass, and\r\nheld him _apayred_ with only the offering of Christian men, and was\r\nholden a clean _mayde_, and did no outrage in drink,\"[249] yet in his\r\nintercourse with William II. and Henry I., he involved himself in\r\nceaseless quarrels; and quitted both his archiepiscopal chair and the\r\ncountry. His memory, however, is consecrated among the fathers of\r\nscholastic divinity.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 245: These were the common school books of the\r\n     period.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 246: Though the abbey of Croyland was burnt only\r\n     twenty-five years after the conquest, its library then\r\n     consisted of 900 volumes, of which 300 were very large. The\r\n     lovers of English history and antiquities are much indebted\r\n     to Ingulph for his excellent history of the abbey of\r\n     Croyland, from its foundation, A.D. 664, to A.D. 1091: into\r\n     which he hath introduced much of the general history of the\r\n     kingdom, with a variety of curious anecdotes that are no\r\n     where else to be found. DR. HENRY: book iii., chap. iv., § 1\r\n     and 2. But Ingulph merits a more particular eulogium. The\r\n     editors of that stupendous, and in truth, matchless\r\n     collection of national history, entitled _Recueil des\r\n     Historiens des Gaules_, thus say of him: \"Il avoit tout vu\r\n     en bon connoisseur, et ce qu'il rapporte, il l'écrit en\r\n     homme lettré, judicieux et vrai:\" tom. xi., p. xlij. In case\r\n     any reader of this note and lover of romance literature\r\n     should happen to be unacquainted with the French language, I\r\n     will add, from the same respectable authority, that \"The\r\n     readers of the _Round Table History_ should be informed that\r\n     there are many minute and curious descriptions in INGULPH\r\n     which throw considerable light upon the history of _Ancient\r\n     Chivalry_.\" Ibid. See too the animated eulogy upon him, at\r\n     p. 153, note _a_, of the same volume. These learned editors\r\n     have, however, forgotten to notice that the best, and only\r\n     perfect, edition of Ingulph's History of Croyland Abbey,\r\n     with the continuation of the same, by Peter de Blois and\r\n     Edward Abbas, is that which is inserted in the first volume\r\n     of Gale's _Rerum Anglicarum Scriptores Veteres_: Oxon, 1684.\r\n     (3 vols.)]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 247: LANFRANC was obliged, against his will, by\r\n     the express command of Abbot Harlein, to take upon him the\r\n     archbishopric in the year 1070. He governed that church for\r\n     nineteen years together, with a great deal of wisdom and\r\n     authority. His largest work is a commentary upon the\r\n     Epistles of St. Paul; which is sometimes not very faithfully\r\n     quoted by Peter Lombard. His treatise in favour of the real\r\n     presence, in opposition to Birenger, is one of his most\r\n     remarkable performances.

Let us fancy we see him, according to Trevisa,[250]\r\ncreeping quietly to his garden arbour, and devoting his midnight\r\nvigils to the investigation of that old-fashioned author, Julius\r\nFirmicus; whom Fabricius calls by a name little short of that of an\r\nold woman. It is a pity we know not more of the private studies of\r\nsuch a bibliomaniac. And equally to be lamented it is that we have not\r\nsome more substantial biographical memoirs of that distinguished\r\nbibliomaniac, HERMAN, bishop of Salisbury; a Norman by birth; and who\r\nlearnt the art of book-binding and book-illumination, before he had\r\nbeen brought over into this country by William the Conqueror.[251] (A\r\ncharacter, by the bye, who, however completely hollow were his claims\r\nto the crown of England, can never be reproached with a backwardness\r\nin promoting learned men to the several great offices of church and\r\nstate.)\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 250: \"This yere deyd thomas archbisohop of york\r\n     and gyralde was archebishop after him; a lecherous man, a\r\n     wytch and euyl doer, as the fame tellyth, for under his pyle\r\n     whan he deyde in an erber was founde a book of curyous\r\n     craftes, the book hight Julius frumeus.

If you proceed thus systematically, my good Lysander, the\r\nmorning cock will crow 'ere we arrive at the book-annals even of the\r\nReformation.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. It is true; I am proceeding rather too methodically. And yet I\r\nsuppose I should not obtain Lisardo's forgiveness if, in arriving at\r\nthe period of HENRY THE SECOND,[252] I did not notice that\r\nextraordinary student and politician, BECKET!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 252: I make no apology to the reader for\r\n     presenting him with the following original character of our\r\n     once highly and justly celebrated monarch, Henry II.--by the\r\n     able pen of Trevisa. \"This HENRY II. was somewhat reddish,\r\n     with large face and breast; and yellow eyen and a dim voice;\r\n     and fleshy of body; and took but scarcely of meat and drink:\r\n     and for to _alledge_ the fatness, he travailed his body with\r\n     business; with hunting, with standing, with wandering: he\r\n     was of mean stature, renable of speech, and well y lettered;\r\n     noble and _orped_ in knighthood; and wise in counsel and in\r\n     battle; and dread and doubtfull destiny; more manly and\r\n     courteous to a Knight when he was dead than when he was\r\n     alive!\" _Polychronicon_, Caxton's edit., fol. cccliij.,\r\n     rev.]\r\n\r\nLIS. At your peril omit him! I think (although my black-letter reading\r\nbe very limited) that Bale, in his _English Votaries_, has a curious\r\ndescription of this renowned archbishop; whose attachment to books, in\r\nhis boyish years, must on all sides be admitted.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. You are right. Bale has some extraordinary strokes of\r\ndescription in his account of this canonized character: but if I can\r\ntrust to my memory (which the juice of Lorenzo's nectar, here before\r\nus, may have somewhat impaired), Tyndale[253] has also an equally\r\nanimated account of the same--who deserves, notwithstanding his pomp\r\nand haughtiness, to be numbered among the most notorious bibliomaniacs\r\nof his age.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 253: We will first amuse ourselves with Bale's\r\n     curious account of\r\n\r\n     \"_The fresh and lusty beginnings of_ THOMAS BECKET.\"\r\n\r\n     As those authors report, which chiefly wrote Thomas Becket's\r\n     life--whose names are Herbert Boseham, John Salisbury,\r\n     William of Canterbury, Alen of Tewkesbury, Benet of\r\n     Peterborough, Stephen Langton, and Richard Croyland--he\r\n     bestoyed his youth in all kinds of lascivious lightness, and\r\n     lecherous wantonness. After certain robberies, rapes, and\r\n     murders, committed in the king's wars at the siege of\r\n     Toulouse in Languedoc, and in other places else, as he was\r\n     come home again into England, he gave himself to great\r\n     study, not of the holy scriptures, but of the bishop of\r\n     Rome's lousy laws, whereby he first of all obtained to be\r\n     archdeacon of Canterbury, under Theobald the archbishop;\r\n     then high chancellor of England; metropolitan, archbishop,\r\n     primate; pope of England, and great legate from antichrist's\r\n     own right side. In the time of his high-chancellorship,\r\n     being but an ale-brewer's son of London, John Capgrave saith\r\n     that he took upon him as he had been a prince. He played the\r\n     courtier altogether, and fashioned himself wholly to the\r\n     king's delights. He ruffled it out in the whole cloth with a\r\n     mighty rabble of disguised ruffians at his tail. He sought\r\n     the worldly honour with him that sought it most. He thought\r\n     it a pleasant thing to have the flattering praises of the\r\n     multitude. His bridle was of silver, his saddle of velvet,\r\n     his stirrups, spurs, and bosses double gilt; his expenses\r\n     far passing the expenses of an earl. That delight was not on\r\n     the earth that he had not plenty of. He fed with the\r\n     fattest, was clad with the softest, and kept company with\r\n     the plesantest. Was not this (think you) a good mean to live\r\n     chaste? I trow it was. _Englyshe Votaryes_, pt. ii., sign.\r\n     P. vi. rect. Printed by Tisdale, 8vo. The orthography is\r\n     modernized, but the words are faithfully _Balëan_! Thus\r\n     writes Tyndale: and the king made him (Becket) his\r\n     chancellor, in which office he passed the pomp and pride of\r\n     Thomas (Wolsey) cardinal, as far as the ones shrine passeth\r\n     the others tomb in glory and riches. And after that, he was\r\n     a man of war, and captain of five or six thousand men in\r\n     full harness, as bright as St. George, and his spear in his\r\n     hand; and encountered whatsoever came against him, and\r\n     overthrew the jollyest rutter that was in the host of\r\n     France. And out of the field, hot from bloodshedding, was he\r\n     made bishop of Canterbury; and did put off his helm, and put\r\n     on his mitre; put off his harness, and on with his robes;\r\n     and laid down his spear, and took his cross ere his hands\r\n     were cold; and so came, with a lusty courage of a man of\r\n     war, to fight an other while against his prince for the\r\n     pope; when his prince's cause were with the law of God, and\r\n     the pope's clean contrary. _Practise of Popish Prelates._\r\n     _Tyndale's Works_, edit. 1572, p. 361. The curious\r\n     bibliographer, or collector of ancient books of biography,\r\n     will find a very different character of Becket in a scarce\r\n     Latin life of him, printed at Paris in the black letter, in\r\n     the fifteenth century. His archiepiscopal table is described\r\n     as being distinguished for great temperance and propriety:\r\n     \"In ejus mensa non audiebantur tibicines non cornicines, non\r\n     lira, non fiala, non karola: nulla quidem præterquam mundam\r\n     splendidam et inundantem epularum opulentiam.

From a yet earlier, and\r\n     perhaps the first printed, mention of Becket--and from a\r\n     volume of which no perfect copy has yet been found--the\r\n     reader is presented with a very curious account of the\r\n     murder of the Archbishop, in its original dress. \"Than were\r\n     there iiij. cursed knyghtes of leuyng yt thoughte to haue\r\n     had a grete thanke of the kyng and mad her a vowe to gedir\r\n     to sle thomas.

But I will push on with the personal history of\r\nliterature, or rather of the BIBLIOMANIA.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 254: \"I shall retire back to _Godstowe_, and, for\r\n     the farther reputation of the nunns there, shall observe\r\n     that they spent a great part of their time in reading good\r\n     books. There was a common library for their use well\r\n     furnished with books, many of which were English, and divers\r\n     of them historical. The lives of the holy men and women,\r\n     especially of the latter, were curiously written ON VELLUM,\r\n     and many ILLUMINATIONS appeared throughout, so as to draw\r\n     the nunns the more easily to follow their examples.\"\r\n     Hearne's edit. _Guil. Neubrig._, vol. ii., p. 768. Again he\r\n     says, \"It is probable they (certain sentences) were written\r\n     in large letters, equal to the writing that we have in the\r\n     finest books of offices, the best of which were for the use\r\n     of the nunns, and for persons of distinction, and such as\r\n     had weak eyes; and many of them were finely covered, not\r\n     unlike the Kiver for the Gospell book, given to the chapell\r\n     of Glastonbury by king Ina.\" p. 773. Can the enlightened\r\n     reader want further proof of the existence of the\r\n     BIBLIOMANIA in the nunnery of Godstow? As to _Peterborough_\r\n     abbey, Gunston, in his history of the same place, has copied\r\n     the catalogue of the different libraries belonging to the\r\n     abbots. Benedict, who became abbot in 1177, had a collection\r\n     of no less than _fifty-seven_ volumes. But alas! the book\r\n     reputation of this monastery soon fell away: for master\r\n     Robert, who died abbot in 1222, left but _seven_ books\r\n     behind him; and Geoffrey de Croyland, who was abbot in 1290,\r\n     had only that dreary old gentleman, _Avicenna_, to keep him\r\n     company! At its dissolution, however, it contained 1700\r\n     volumes in MSS. _Gunton's Peterborough_, p. 173.\r\n     _Glastonbury_ seems to have long maintained its reputation\r\n     for a fine library; and even as late as the year 1248 it\r\n     could boast of several classical authors, although the\r\n     English books were only four in number; the rest being\r\n     considered as \"vetustas et inutilia.\" The classical authors\r\n     were Livy, Sallust, Tully, Seneca, Virgil, and Persius. See\r\n     _Joh. Confrat. Glaston._, vol. ii., p. 423, 435: Hearne's\r\n     edit. \"Leland,\" says Warton, \"who visited all the\r\n     monasteries just before their dissolution, seems to have\r\n     been struck with the venerable air and amplitude of this\r\n     library.\" _Hist.

Judge of the anxiety of\r\ncertain antiquated families, especially of the Welch nation, which\r\nstimulated them to open their choicest treasures, in the book way, to\r\ngratify the genealogical ardour of our tourist!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 255: There is a supplemental volume to the two\r\n     English ones, containing the only complete Latin edition\r\n     extant of the Welsh Itinerary.

I wish from my heart that Girald Barri had been somewhat more\r\ncommunicative on this head!\r\n\r\nLOREN. Of what do you suppose he would have informed us, had he\r\nindulged this bibliographical gossipping?\r\n\r\nLIS. Of many a grand and many a curious volume.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Not exactly so, Lisardo. The art of book-illumination in this\r\ncountry was then sufficiently barbarous, if at all known.\r\n\r\nLIS. And yet I'll lay a vellum Aldus that Henry the second presented\r\nhis fair Rosamond with some choice _Heures de Notre Dame_! But\r\nproceed. I beg pardon for this interruption.\r\n\r\nLYSAND.

Pray proceed, Lysander, in your book-collecting history! unless\r\nyou will permit me to make a pause or interruption of two minutes--by\r\nproposing as a sentiment--\"SUCCESS TO THE BIBLIOMANIA!\"\r\n\r\nPHIL. 'Tis well observed: and as every loyal subject at our great\r\ntaverns drinks the health of his Sovereign \"with three times three\r\nup-standing,\" even so let us hail this sentiment of Lorenzo!\r\n\r\nLIS.

Now the uproar of Bacchus has subsided, the instructive\r\nconversation of Minerva may follow. Go on, Lysander.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Having endeavoured to do justice to Girald Barri, I know of no\r\nother particularly distinguished bibliomaniac till we approach the æra\r\nof the incomparable ROGER, or FRIAR, BACON. I say incomparable,\r\nLorenzo; because he was, in truth, a constellation of the very first\r\nsplendour and magnitude in the dark times in which he lived; and\r\nnotwithstanding a sagacious writer (if my memory be not treacherous)\r\nof the name of Coxe, chooses to tell us that he was \"miserably starved\r\nto death, because he could not introduce a piece of roast beef into\r\nhis stomach, on account of having made a league with Satan to eat only\r\ncheese;\"[257]--yet I suspect that the end of Bacon was hastened by\r\nother means more disgraceful to the age and equally painful to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 257: \"_A short treatise declaringe the detestable\r\n     wickednesse of magicall sciences, as necromancie,\r\n     coniuration of spirites, curiouse astrologie, and suche\r\n     lyke, made by_ FRANCIS COXE.\" Printed by Allde, 12mo.,\r\n     without date (14 leaves). From this curious little volume,\r\n     which is superficially noticed by Herbert (vol. ii., p.\r\n     889), the reader is presented with the following extract,\r\n     appertaining to the above subject: \"I myself (says the\r\n     author) knew a priest not far from a town called\r\n     Bridgewater, which, as it is well known in the country, was\r\n     a great magician in all his life time. After he once began\r\n     these practices, he would never eat bread, but, instead\r\n     thereof, did always eat _cheese_: which thing, as he\r\n     confessed divers times, he did because it was so concluded\r\n     betwixt him and the spirit which served him,\" &c. sign. A\r\n     viii. rect. \"(R.) Bacon's end was much after _the like\r\n     sort_; for having a greedy desire unto meat, he could cause\r\n     nothing to enter the stomach--wherefore thus miserably he\r\n     starved to death.\" Sign. B. iij. rev. Not having at hand\r\n     John Dee's book of the defence of Roger Bacon, from the\r\n     charge of astrology and magic (the want of which one laments\r\n     as pathetically as did Naudé, in his \"_Apologie pour tous\r\n     les grands personnages, &c., faussement soupçonnez de\r\n     Magic_,\" Haye, 1653, 8vo., p. 488), I am at a loss to say\r\n     the fine things, which Dee must have said, in commendation\r\n     of the extraordinary talents of ROGER BACON; who was\r\n     miserably matched in the age in which he lived; but who,\r\n     together with his great patron GROSTESTE, will shine forth\r\n     as beacons to futurity. Dr. Friend in his _History of\r\n     Physic_ has enumerated what he conceived to be Bacon's\r\n     leading works; while Gower in his _Confessio Amantis_\r\n     (Caxton's edit., fol. 70), has mentioned the brazen head--\r\n\r\n                     =for to telle\r\n          Of such thyngs as befelle:=\r\n\r\n     which was the joint manufactory of the patron and his èleve.\r\n     As lately as the year 1666, Bacon's life formed the subject\r\n     of a \"famous history,\" from which Walter Scott has given us\r\n     a facetious anecdote in the seventh volume (p. 10) of\r\n     _Dryden's Works_. But the curious investigator of ancient\r\n     times, and the genuine lover of British biography, will\r\n     seize upon the more prominent features in the life of this\r\n     renowned philosopher; will reckon up his great discoveries\r\n     in optics and physics; and will fancy, upon looking at the\r\n     above picture of his study, that an explosion from\r\n     gun-powder (of which our philosopher has been thought the\r\n     inventor) has protruded the palings which are leaning\r\n     against its sides. Bacon's \"_Opus Majus_,\" which happened to\r\n     meet the eyes of Pope Clement IV., and which _now_ would\r\n     have encircled the neck of its author with an hundred golden\r\n     chains, and procured for him a diploma from every learned\r\n     society in Europe--just served to liberate him from his\r\n     first long imprisonment. This was succeeded by a subsequent\r\n     confinement of twelve years; from which he was released only\r\n     time enough to breathe his last in the pure air of heaven.\r\n     Whether he expended 3000, or 30,000 pounds of our present\r\n     money, upon his experiments, can now be only matter of\r\n     conjecture. Those who are dissatisfied with the meagre\r\n     manner in which our early biographers have noticed the\r\n     labours of Roger Bacon, and with the _tetragonistical_\r\n     story, said by Twyne to be propagated by our philosopher, of\r\n     Julius Cæsar's seeing the whole of the British coast and\r\n     encampment upon the Gallic shore, \"maximorum ope speculorum\"\r\n     (_Antiquit. Acad. Oxon. Apolog._ 1608, 4to., p. 353), may be\r\n     pleased with the facetious story told of him by Wood\r\n     (_Annals of Oxford_, vol. i., 216, Gutch's edit.) and yet\r\n     more by the minute catalogue of his works noticed by Bishop\r\n     Tanner (_Bibl. Brit. Hibern._ p. 62): while the following\r\n     eulogy of old Tom Fuller cannot fail to find a passage to\r\n     every heart: \"For mine own part (says this delightful and\r\n     original writer) I behold the name of Bacon in Oxford, not\r\n     as of an individual man, but corporation of men; no single\r\n     cord, but a twisted cable of many together. And as all the\r\n     acts of strong men of that nature are attributed to an\r\n     Hercules; all the predictions of prophecying women to a\r\n     Sibyll; so I conceive all the achievements of the Oxonian\r\n     Bacons, in their liberal studies, are ascribed to ONE, as\r\n     chief of the name.\" _Church History_, book iii., p. 96.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOnly let us imagine we see this sharp-eyed philosopher at work in his\r\nstudy, of which yonder print is generally received as a\r\nrepresentation! How heedlessly did he hear the murmuring of the stream\r\nbeneath, and of the winds without--immersed in the vellum and\r\nparchment rolls of theological, astrological, and mathematical lore,\r\nwhich, upon the dispersion of the libraries of the Jews,[258] he was\r\nconstantly perusing, and of which so large a share had fallen to his\r\nown lot!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 258: Warton, in his second Dissertation, says that\r\n     \"great multitudes of their (the Jews) books fell into the\r\n     hands of Roger Bacon;\" and refers to Wood's _Hist. et\r\n     Antiquit. Univ. Oxon._, vol. i., 77, 132--where I find\r\n     rather a slight notification of it--but, in the genuine\r\n     edition of this latter work, published by Mr. Gutch, vol.\r\n     i., p. 329, it is said: \"At their (the Jews) expulsion,\r\n     divers of their tenements that were forfeited to the king,\r\n     came into the hands of William Burnell, Provost of Wells;\r\n     and _their books_ (for many of them were learned) to divers\r\n     of our scholars; among whom, as is verily supposed, ROGER\r\n     BACON was one: and that he furnished himself with such\r\n     Hebrew rarities, that he could not elsewhere find. Also\r\n     that, when he died, he left them to the Franciscan library\r\n     at Oxon, which, being not well understood in after-times,\r\n     were condemned to moths and dust!\" Weep, weep, kind-hearted\r\n     bibliomaniac, when thou thinkest upon the fate of these poor\r\n     Hebrew MSS.!]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, my friends, little is known with certainty, though much\r\nis vaguely conjectured, of the labours of this great man. Some of the\r\nfirst scholars and authors of our own and of other countries have been\r\nproud to celebrate his praises; nor would it be considered a disgrace\r\nby the most eminent of modern experimental philosophers--of him, who\r\nhas been described as \"unlocking the hidden treasures of nature, and\r\nexplaining the various systems by which air, and earth, and fire, and\r\nwater, counteract and sustain each other\"[259]--to fix the laureate\r\ncrown round the brows of our venerable Bacon!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 259: See a periodical paper, entitled _The\r\n     Director_! vol. ii., p. 294.]\r\n\r\nWe have now reached the close of the thirteenth century and the reign\r\nof EDWARD THE FIRST;[260] when the principal thing that strikes us,\r\nconnected with the history of libraries, is this monarch's insatiable\r\nlust of strengthening his title to the kingdom of Scotland by\r\npurchasing \"the libraries of all the monasteries\" for the securing of\r\nany record which might corroborate the same. What he gave for this\r\ntremendous book-purchase, or of what nature were the volumes\r\npurchased, or what was their subsequent destination, is a knot yet\r\nremaining to be untied.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 260: \"King Edward the first caused and committed\r\n     divers copies of the records, and much concerning the realm\r\n     of Scotland, unto divers abbies for the preservance thereof;\r\n     which for the most part are now perished, or rare to be had;\r\n     and which privilie by the dissolution of monasteries is\r\n     detained. The same king caused the libraries of all\r\n     monasteries, and other places of the realm, to be purchased,\r\n     for the further and manifest declaration of his title, as\r\n     chief Lord of Scotland: and the record thereof now extant,\r\n     doth alledge divers leger books of abbeys for the\r\n     confirmation thereof\": Petition (to Q.

Indeed, I could gossip\r\naway upon the same 'till midnight. His severe disappointment upon\r\nhaving Froissart's presentation copy of his Chronicles[261]\r\n(gergeously [Transcriber's Note: gorgeously] attired as it must have\r\nbeen) taken from him by the Duke of Anjou, is alone a sufficient\r\ndemonstration of his love of books; while his patronage of Chaucer\r\nshews that he had accurate notions of intellectual excellence.\r\nPrinting had not yet begun to give any hint, however faint, of its\r\nwonderful powers; and scriveners or book-copiers were sufficiently\r\nignorant and careless.[262]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 261: Whether this presentation copy ever came,\r\n     eventually, into the kingdom, is unknown. Mr. Johnes, who is\r\n     as intimate with Froissart as Gough was with Camden, is\r\n     unable to make up his mind upon the subject; but we may\r\n     suppose it was properly emblazoned, &c. The duke detained it\r\n     as being the property of an enemy to France!--Now, when we\r\n     read of this wonderfully chivalrous age, so glowingly\r\n     described by the great Gaston, Count de Foix, to Master\r\n     Froissart, upon their introduction to each other (vide St.\r\n     Palaye's memoir in the 10th vol. of _L'Acadamie des\r\n     Inscriptions_, &c.), it does seem a gross violation (at\r\n     least on the part of the Monsieur of France!) of all\r\n     gentlemanly and knight-like feeling, to seize upon a volume\r\n     of this nature, as legitimate plunder! The robber should\r\n     have had his skin tanned, after death, for a case to keep\r\n     the book in! Of Edward the Third's love of curiously bound\r\n     books, see p. 118, ante.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 262: \"How ordinary a fault this was (of\r\n     'negligently or willfully altering copies') amongst the\r\n     transcribers of former times, may appear by Chaucer; who (I\r\n     am confident) tooke as greate care as any man to be served\r\n     with the best and heedfullest scribes, and yet we finde him\r\n     complayning against Adam, his scrivener, for the very same:\r\n\r\n            So ofte a daye I mote thy worke renew,\r\n          If to correct and eke to rubbe and scrape,\r\n          And all is thorow thy neglegence and rape.\"\r\n\r\n          Ashmole _Theatrum Chemicum_; p. 439.]\r\n\r\nThe mention of Edward the Third, as a patron of learned men, must\r\nnecessarily lead a book-antiquary to the notice of his eminent\r\nchancellor, RICHARD DE BURY; of whom, as you may recollect, some\r\nslight mention was made the day before yesterday.[263] It is hardly\r\npossible to conceive a more active and enthusiastic lover of books\r\nthan was this extraordinary character; the passion never deserting him\r\neven while he sat upon the bench.[264] It was probably De Bury's\r\nintention to make his royal master eclipse his contemporary CHARLES\r\nTHE VTH, of France--the most renowned foreign bibliomaniac of his\r\nage![265] In truth, my dear friends, what can be more delightful to a\r\nlover of his country's intellectual reputation than to find such a\r\ncharacter as De Bury, in such an age of war and bloodshed, uniting the\r\ncalm and mild character of a legislator, with the sagacity of a\r\nphilosopher, and the elegant-mindedness of a scholar! Foreigners have\r\nbeen profuse in their commendations of him, and with the greatest\r\njustice; while our Thomas Warton, of ever-to-be-respected memory, has\r\nshewn us how pleasingly he could descend from the graver tone of a\r\nhistorical antiquary, by indulging himself in a chit-chat style of\r\nbook-anecdote respecting this illustrious character.[266]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 263: See p. 29, ante.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 264: \"--patescebat nobis aditus facilis, regalis\r\n     favoris intuitu, ad librorum latebras libere perscrutandas.\r\n     Amoris quippe nostri fama volatilis jam ubique percrebuit,\r\n     tamtumque librorum, et maxime veterum, ferebamur cupiditate\r\n     languescere; posse vero quemlibet, nostrum _per quaternos_\r\n     facilius, quam _per pecuniam_, adipisci favorem.\"\r\n     _Philobiblion; sive de Amore Librorum_ (vide p. 29, ante),\r\n     p. 29: edit. 1599, 4to. But let the reader indulge me with\r\n     another extract or two, containing evidence [Transcriber's\r\n     Note: 'of' missing in original] the most unquestionable of\r\n     the severest symptoms of the BIBLIOMANIA that ever assailed\r\n     a Lord Chancellor or a Bishop!--Magliabechi must have read\r\n     the ensuing passage with rapture: \"Quamobrem cum prædicti\r\n     principis recolendæ memoriæ bonitate suffulti, possemus\r\n     obesse et prodesse, officere et proficere vehementer tam\r\n     maioribus quam pusillis; affluxerunt, loco xeniorum et\r\n     munerum, locoque, donorum et iocalium, temulenti quaterni,\r\n     ac decripiti codices; nostris tamen tam affectibus, quam\r\n     aspectibus, pretiosi.

However,\r\n     the editor's enthusiastic admiration of De Bury obtains his\r\n     forgiveness in the bosom of every honest bibliomaniac!]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 265: CHARLES THE FIFTH, of France, may be called\r\n     the founder of the Royal Library there. The history of his\r\n     first efforts to erect a national library is thus, in part,\r\n     related by the compilers of _Cat. de la Bibliothéque\r\n     Royale_, pt. i., p. ij.-iij.: \"This wise king took advantage\r\n     of the peace which then obtained, in order to cultivate\r\n     letters more successfully than had hitherto been done. He\r\n     was learned for his age; and never did a prince love reading\r\n     and book-collecting better than did he! He was not only\r\n     constantly making transcripts himself, but the noblemen,\r\n     courtiers, and officers that surrounded him voluntarily\r\n     tendered their services in the like cause; while, on the\r\n     other hand, a number of learned men, seduced by his liberal\r\n     rewards, spared nothing to add to his literary treasures.\r\n     Charles now determined to give his subjects every possible\r\n     advantage from this accumulation of books; and, with this\r\n     view, he lodged them in one of the _Towers of the Louvre_;\r\n     which tower was hence called _La Tour de la Librarie_. The\r\n     books occupied three stories: in the first, were desposited\r\n     269 volumes; in the second 260; and in the third, 381\r\n     volumes. In order to preserve them with the utmost care (say\r\n     Sauval and Felibien), the king caused all the windows of the\r\n     library to be fortified with iron bars; between which was\r\n     painted glass, secured by brass-wires. And that the books\r\n     might be accessible at all hours, there were suspended, from\r\n     the ceiling, thirty chandeliers and a silver lamp, which\r\n     burnt all night long. The walls were wainscotted with Irish\r\n     wood; and the ceiling was covered with cypress wood: the\r\n     whole being curiously sculptured in bas-relief.\" Whoever has\r\n     not this catalogue at hand (vide p. 93, ante) to make\r\n     himself master of still further curious particulars relating\r\n     to this library, may examine the first and second volume of\r\n     _L'Academie des Inscriptions_, &c.--from which the preceding\r\n     account is taken. The reader may also look into Warton\r\n     (Diss. 11, vol. i., sign. f. 2); who adds, on the authority\r\n     of Boivin's _Mem. Lit._, tom. ii., p. 747, that the Duke of\r\n     Bedford, regent of France, \"in the year 1425 (when the\r\n     English became masters of Paris) sent his whole library,\r\n     then consisting of only 853 volumes, and valued at 2223\r\n     livres, into England,\" &c. I have little doubt but that\r\n     Richard De Bury had a glimpse of this infantine royal\r\n     collection, from the following passage--which occurs\r\n     immediately after an account of his ambassadorial\r\n     excursion--\"O beate Deus Deorum in Syon, quantus impetus\r\n     fluminis voluptatis lætificavit cor nostrum, quoties\r\n     Paradisum mundi _Parisios_ visitare vacavimus ibi moraturi?\r\n     Ubi nobis semper dies pauci, præ amoris magnitudine,\r\n     videbantur.

Sade, in his\r\n     _Memoirs of Petrarch_, tells us that \"the former did in\r\n     England, what the latter all his life was doing in France,\r\n     Italy, and Germany, towards the discovery of the best\r\n     ancient writers, and making copies of them under his own\r\n     superintendence.\" De Bury bequeathed a valuable library of\r\n     MSS. to Durham, now Trinity College, Oxford. The books of\r\n     this library were first packed up in chests; but upon the\r\n     completion of the room to receive them, \"they were put into\r\n     pews or studies, and chained to them.\" Wood's _History of\r\n     the University of Oxford_, vol. ii., p. 911. Gutch's edit.\r\n     De Bury's _Philobiblion_, from which so much has been\r\n     extracted, is said by Morhof to \"savor somewhat of the\r\n     rudeness of the age, but is rather elegantly written; and\r\n     many things are well expressed in it relating to\r\n     bibliothecism.\" _Polyhist. Literar._, vol. i., 187. The real\r\n     author is supposed to have been Robert Holcott, a Dominican\r\n     friar. I am, however, loth to suppress a part of what Warton\r\n     has so pleasantly written (as above alluded to by Lysander)\r\n     respecting such a favourite as DE BURY. \"Richard de Bury,\r\n     otherwise called Richard Aungervylle, is said to have alone\r\n     possessed more books than all the bishops of England\r\n     together. Beside the fixed libraries which he had formed in\r\n     his several palaces, the floor of his common apartment was\r\n     so covered with books that those who entered could not with\r\n     due reverence approach his presence. He kept binders,\r\n     illuminators, and writers, in his palaces. Petrarch says\r\n     that he had once a conversation with him, concerning the\r\n     island called by the ancients Thule; calling him 'virum\r\n     ardentis ingenii.' While chancellor and treasurer, instead\r\n     of the usual presents and new-year's gifts appendant to his\r\n     office, he chose to receive those perquisites in books. By\r\n     the favour of Edward III. he gained access to the libraries\r\n     of most of the capital monasteries; where he shook off the\r\n     dust from volumes, preserved in chests and presses, which\r\n     had not been opened for many ages.\" _Philobiblion_, cap. 29,\r\n     30.--Warton also quotes, in English, a part of what had been\r\n     already presented to the reader in its original Latin form.\r\n     _Hist. Engl. Poetry_, vol. i., Diss. II., note g., sign. h.\r\n     4. Prettily painted as is this picture, by Warton, the\r\n     colouring might have been somewhat heightened, and the\r\n     effect rendered still more striking, in consequence, if the\r\n     authority and the words of Godwyn had been a little attended\r\n     to. In this latter's _Catalogue of the Bishops of England_,\r\n     p. 524-5, edit. 1601, we find that De Bury was the son of\r\n     one SIR RICHARD ANGARUILL, knight: \"that he saith of\r\n     himselfe 'exstatico quodam librorum amore potenter se\r\n     abreptum'--that he was mightily carried away, and even\r\n     beside himself, with immoderate love of bookes and desire of\r\n     reading. He had alwaies in his house many chaplaines, all\r\n     great schollers. His manner was, at dinner and supper-time,\r\n     to haue some good booke read unto him, whereof he would\r\n     discourse with his chaplaines a great part of the day\r\n     following, if busines interrupted not his course. He was\r\n     very bountiful unto the poore. Weekely he bestowed for their\r\n     reliefe, 8 quarters of wheat made into bread, beside the\r\n     offall and fragments of his tables. Riding betweene\r\n     Newcastle and Durham he would give 8_l._ in almes; from\r\n     Durham to Stocton, 5_l._: from Durham to Aukland, 5 marks;\r\n     from Durham to Middleham, 5_l._\" &c. This latter is the\r\n     \"pars melior\" of every human being; and bibliomaniacs seem\r\n     to have possessed it as largely as any other tribe of\r\n     mortals. I have examined Richardson's magnificent reprint of\r\n     Godwyn's book, in the Latin tongue, London, 1743, folio; p.\r\n     747; and find nothing worth adding to the original text.]\r\n\r\nLOREN. The task we have imposed upon you, my good Lysander, would be\r\nsevere indeed if you were to notice, with minute exactness, all the\r\nbook-anecdotes of the middle ages. You have properly introduced the\r\nname and authority of Warton; but if you suffered yourself to be\r\nbeguiled by his enchanting style, into all the bibliographical\r\ngossiping of this period, you would have no mercy upon your lungs, and\r\nthere would be no end to the disquisition.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Forgive me, if I have transgressed the boundaries of good\r\nsense or good breeding: it was not my intention to make a \"_Concio ad\r\nAulam_\"--as worthy old Bishop Saunderson was fond of making--but\r\nsimply to state facts, or indulge in book chit-chat, as my memory\r\nserved me.\r\n\r\nLIS. Nay, Lorenzo, do not disturb the stream of Lysander's eloquence.\r\nI could listen 'till \"Jocund day stood tip-toe on the mountain.\"\r\n\r\nPHIL. You are a little unconscionable, Lisardo: but I apprehend\r\nLorenzo meant only to guard Lysander against that minuteness of\r\nnarration which takes us into every library and every study of the\r\nperiod at which we are arrived. If I recollect aright, Warton was\r\nobliged to restrain himself in the same cause.[267]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 267: The part alluded to, in Warton, is at the\r\n     commencement of his second Dissertation \"On the Introduction\r\n     of Learning into Great Britain.\" After rambling with the\r\n     utmost felicity, among the libraries, and especially the\r\n     monastic ones, of the earlier and middle ages--he thus\r\n     checks himself by saying, that \"in pursuit of these\r\n     anecdotes, he is imperceptibly seduced into later periods,\r\n     or rather is deviating from his subject.\"]\r\n\r\nLOREN. It belongs to me, Lysander, to solicit your forgiveness. If you\r\nare not tired with the discussion of such a various and extensive\r\nsubject (and more particularly from the energetic manner in which it\r\nis conducted on your part), rely upon it that your auditors cannot\r\npossibly feel _ennui_. Every thing before us partakes of your\r\nenthusiasm: the wine becomes mellower, and sparkles with a ruddier\r\nglow; the flavour of the fruit is improved; and the scintillations of\r\nyour conversational eloquence are scattered amidst my books, my busts,\r\nand my pictures. Proceed, I entreat you; but first, accept my libation\r\noffered up at the shrine of an offended deity.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. You do me, and the _Bibliomania_, too much honour. If my\r\nblushes do not overpower me, I will proceed: but first, receive the\r\nattestation of the deity that he is no longer affronted with you. I\r\ndrink to your health and long life!--and proceed:\r\n\r\nIf, among the numerous and gorgeous books which now surround us, it\r\nshould be my good fortune to put my hand upon one, however small or\r\nimperfect, which could give us some account of the _History of British\r\nLibraries_, it would save me a great deal of trouble, by causing me to\r\nmaintain at least a chronological consistency in my discourse. But,\r\nsince this cannot be--since, with all our love of books and of\r\nlearning, we have this pleasing desideratum yet to be supplied--I must\r\ngo on, in my usual desultory manner, in rambling among libraries, and\r\ndiscoursing about books and book-collectors. As we enter upon the\r\nreign of HENRY IV., we cannot avoid the mention of that distinguished\r\nlibrary hunter, and book describer, JOHN BOSTON of Bury;[268] who may\r\njustly be considered the Leland of his day. Gale, if I recollect\r\nrightly, unaccountably describes his bibliomaniacal career as having\r\ntaken place in the reign of Henry VII.; but Bale and Pits, from whom\r\nTanner has borrowed his account, unequivocally affix the date of 1410\r\nto Boston's death; which is three years before the death of Henry. It\r\nis allowed, by the warmest partizans of the reformation, that the\r\ndissolution of the monastic libraries has unfortunately rendered the\r\nlabours of Boston of scarcely any present utility.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 268: It is said of BOSTON that he visited almost\r\n     every public library, and described the titles of every book\r\n     therein, with punctilious accuracy. Pits (593) calls him\r\n     \"vir pius, litteratus, et bonarum litterarum fautor ac\r\n     promotor singularis.\" Bale (p. 549, edit. 1559) has even the\r\n     candour to say, \"mirâ sedulitate et diligentia omnes omnium\r\n     regni monasteriorum bibliothecas invisit: librorum collegit\r\n     titulos, et authorum eorum nomina: quæ omnia alphabetico\r\n     disposuit ordine, et quasi unam omnium bibliothecam fecit.\"\r\n     What Lysander observes above is very true: \"non enim\r\n     dissimulanda (says Gale) monasteriorum subversio, quæ brevi\r\n     spatio subsecuta est--libros omnes dispersit et BOSTONI\r\n     providam diligentiam, maxima ex parte, inutilem reddidit.\"\r\n     _Rer. Anglicar. Scrip. Vet._, vol. iii., præf. p. 1. That\r\n     indefatigable antiquary, Thomas Hearne, acknowledges that,\r\n     in spite of all his researches in the Bodleian library, he\r\n     was scarcely able to discover any thing of Boston's which\r\n     related to Benedictus Abbas--and still less of his own\r\n     compositions. _Bened. Abbat._ vol. i., præf. p. xvii. It is\r\n     a little surprising that Leland should have omitted to\r\n     notice him. But the reader should consult Tanner's _Bibl.\r\n     Britan._, p. xvii., 114.]\r\n\r\nThere is a curious anecdote of this period in Rymer's Foedera,[269]\r\nabout taking off the duty upon _six barrels of books_, sent by a Roman\r\nCardinal to the prior of the Conventual church of St. Trinity,\r\nNorwich. These barrels, which lay at the custom-house, were imported\r\nduty free; and I suspect that Henry's third son, the celebrated John\r\nDuke of Bedford, who was then a lad, and just beginning to feed his\r\nbibliomaniacal appetite, had some hand in interceding with his father\r\nfor the redemption of the duty.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 269: Vol. viii., p. 501. It is a Clause Roll of\r\n     the 9th of Henry IV. A.D. 1407: \"De certis Libris, absque\r\n     Custumenda solvenda, liberandis;\" and affords too amusing a\r\n     specimen of custom-house latinity to be withheld from the\r\n     reader. \"Mandamus vobis, quod certos libros _in sex Barellis\r\n     contentos_, Priori qt Conventui Ecclesiæ Sanctæ Trinitatis\r\n     Norwici, per quendam Adam nuper Cardinalem legatos, et in\r\n     portum civitatis nostræ predictæ (Londinensis) ab urbe\r\n     Romanâ jam adductos, præfato, Priori, absque Custuma seu\r\n     subsidio inde ad opus nostrum capiendis, liberetis\r\n     indilate,\" &c.]\r\n\r\nLIS. This DUKE OF BEDFORD was the most notorious bibliomaniac as well\r\nas warrior of his age; and, when abroad, was indefatigable in stirring\r\nup the emulation of Flemish and French artists, to execute for him the\r\nmost splendid books of devotion. I have heard great things of what\r\ngoes by the name of _The Bedford Missal_![270]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 270: This missal, executed under the eye and for\r\n     the immediate use of the famous John, Duke of Bedford\r\n     (regent of France), and Jane (the daughter of the Duke of\r\n     Burgundy) his wife, was, at the beginning of the 18th\r\n     century, in the magnificent library of Harley, Earl of\r\n     Oxford. It afterwards came into the collection of his\r\n     daughter, the well-known Duchess of Portland; at whose sale,\r\n     in 1786, it was purchased by Mr. Edwards for 215 guineas;\r\n     and 500 guineas have been, a few years ago, offered for this\r\n     identical volume. It is yet the property of this last\r\n     mentioned gentleman. Among the pictures in it, there is an\r\n     interesting one of the whole length portraits of the Duke\r\n     and Duchess;--the head of the former of which has been\r\n     enlarged and engraved by Vertue for his portraits to\r\n     illustrate the History of England. The missal frequently\r\n     displays the arms of these noble personages; and also\r\n     affords a pleasing testimony of the affectionate gallantry\r\n     of the pair; the motto of the former being \"A VOUS ENTIER:\"\r\n     that of the latter, \"J'EN SUIS CONTENTE.\" There is a former\r\n     attestation in the volume, of its having been given by the\r\n     Duke to his nephew, Henry VI. as \"a most suitable present.\"\r\n     But the reader shall consult (if he can procure it) Mr.\r\n     Gough's curious little octavo volume written expressly upon\r\n     the subject.]\r\n\r\nLYSAND. And not greater than what merits to be said of it. I have seen\r\nthis splendid bijou in the charming collection of our friend ----. It\r\nis a small thick folio, highly illuminated; and displaying, as well in\r\nthe paintings as in the calligraphy, the graphic powers of that age,\r\nwhich had not yet witnessed even the dry pencil of Perugino. More\r\ngorgeous, more beautifully elaborate, and more correctly graceful,\r\nmissals may be in existence; but a more curious, interesting, and\r\nperfect specimen, of its kind, is no where to be seen: the portraits\r\nof the Duke and of his royal brother Henry V. being the best paintings\r\nknown of the age. 'Tis, in truth, a lovely treasure in the book way;\r\nand it should sleep every night upon an eider-down pillow encircled\r\nwith emeralds!\r\n\r\nLIS. Hear him--hear him! Lysander must be a collateral descendant of\r\nthis noble bibliomaniac, whose blood, now circulating in his veins,\r\nthus moves him to \"discourse most eloquently.\"\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Banter as you please; only \"don't disturb the stream of my\r\neloquence.\"\r\n\r\nThe period of this distinguished nobleman was that in which\r\nbook-collecting began to assume a fixed and important character in\r\nthis country. Oxford saw a glimmering of civilization dawning in her\r\nobscured atmosphere. A short but dark night had succeeded the\r\npatriotic efforts of De Bury; whose curious volumes, bequeathed to\r\nTrinity College, had laid in a melancholy and deserted condition 'till\r\nthey were kept company by those of COBHAM, Bishop of Worcester, REDE,\r\nBishop of Chichester, and HUMPHREY the good Duke of Gloucester.[271]\r\nNow began the fashion (and may it never fall to decay!) of making\r\npresents to public libraries:--but, during the short and splendid\r\ncareer of HENRY V., learning yielded to arms: the reputation of a\r\nscholar to that of a soldier. I am not aware of any thing at this\r\nperiod, connected with the subject of our discourse, that deserves\r\nparticular mention; although we ought never to name this illustrious\r\nmonarch, or to think of his matchless prowess in arms, without\r\ncalling to mind how he adorned the rough character of a soldier by\r\nthe manners of a prince, the feelings of a Christian, and, I had\r\nalmost said, the devotion of a saint.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 271: We will first notice COBHAM, Bishop of\r\n     Worcester: who \"having had a great desire to show some love\r\n     to his mother the university of Oxford, began, about the\r\n     year 1320, to build, or at least to make some reparations\r\n     for _a Library_, over the old congregation house in the\r\n     north church-yard of St. Mary's; but he dying soon after,\r\n     before any considerable matter was done therein, left\r\n     certain moneys for the carrying on of the work, and all his\r\n     books, with others that had been lately procured, to be,\r\n     with those belonging to the university (as yet kept in\r\n     chests) reposed therein.\" Some controversy afterwards\r\n     arising between the University and Oriel College, to which\r\n     latter Cobham belonged, the books lay in dreary and\r\n     neglected state till 1367; when a room having been built for\r\n     their reception, it was settled that they \"should be reposed\r\n     and chained in the said room or solar; that the scholars of\r\n     the University should have free ingress and regress, at\r\n     certain times, to make proficiency in them; that certain of\r\n     the said books, of greater price, should be sold, till the\r\n     sum of _l._ 40 was obtained for them (unless other remedy\r\n     could be found) with which should be bought an yearly rent\r\n     of _l._ 3, for the maintenance of a chaplain, that should\r\n     pray for the soul of the said bishop, and other benefactors\r\n     of the University both living and dead, and have the custody\r\n     or oversight of the said books, and of those in the ancient\r\n     chest of books, and chest of rolls.\" Wood's _Hist. of the\r\n     University of Oxford_, vol. ii., pt. ii., 911. Gutch's edit.\r\n     WILLIAM REDE, or READ, bishop of Chichester, \"sometimes\r\n     Fellow (of Merton College) gave a chest with _l._ 100 in\r\n     gold in it, to be borrowed by the Fellows for their relief;\r\n     bond being first given in by them to repay it at their\r\n     departure from the college; or, in case they should die, to\r\n     be paid by their executors: A.D. 1376. He also built, about\r\n     the same time, _a Library_ in the college; being the first\r\n     that the society enjoyed, and gave books thereunto.\" Wood's\r\n     _History of the Colleges and Halls_, p. 15, Gutch's edit. In\r\n     Mr. Nicholl's _Appendix to the History of Leicester_, p.\r\n     105, note 20, I find some account of this distinguished\r\n     literary character, taken from Tanner's _Bibl. Britan._, p.\r\n     618. He is described, in both authorities, as being a very\r\n     learned Fellow of Merton College, where he built and\r\n     furnished _a noble library_; on the wall of which was\r\n     painted his portrait, with this inscription: \"GULIELMUS\r\n     REDÆUS, EPISCOPUS CICESTRENSIS, MAGISTER IN THEOLOGIA,\r\n     PROFUNDUS ASTRONOMUS, QUONDAM SOCIUS ISTIUS COLLEGII, QUI\r\n     HANC LIBRARIAM FIERI FECIT.\" Many of Read's mathematical\r\n     instruments, as well as his portrait, were preserved in the\r\n     library when Harrison wrote his description of England,\r\n     prefix'd to Holinshed's Chronicles; some of the former of\r\n     which came into the possession of the historian. For thus\r\n     writes Harrison: \"William Read, sometime fellow of Merteine\r\n     college in Oxford, doctor of divinitie, and the most\r\n     profound astronomer that liued in his time, as appeareth by\r\n     his collection, which some time I did possesse; his image is\r\n     yet in the librarie there; and manie instruments of\r\n     astronomie reserued in that house,\" &c. _Chronicles_ (1587),\r\n     edit. 1807, vol. i., p. 237. In the year 1808, when I\r\n     visited the ancient and interesting brick-floored library of\r\n     Merton College, for the purpose of examining early printed\r\n     books, I looked around in vain for the traces, however\r\n     faded, of Read's portrait: nor could I discover a single\r\n     vestige of the BIBLIOTHECA READIANA! The memory of this once\r\n     celebrated bishop lives therefore only in what books have\r\n     recorded of him; and this brief and _verbal picture_ of Read\r\n     is here drawn--as was the more finished resemblance of\r\n     Chaucer by the pencil, which Occleve has left behind--\r\n\r\n          =That thei that have of him lost thoute and mynde\r\n          By this peinture may ageine him fynde.=\r\n\r\n     HUMPHREY, Duke of GLOUCESTER, \"commonly called _the good_,\r\n     was youngest brother to Henry V. and the first founder of\r\n     the university library in Oxford, which was pillaged of the\r\n     greater part of its books in the reign of Edward the Sixth.\"\r\n     Park's edit. of the _Royal and Noble Authors_; vol. i., 198.\r\n     \"As for the books which he gave (says Wood) they were very\r\n     many, more by far than authors report; for whereas 'tis said\r\n     he gave 129, you shall find anon that they were more than\r\n     treble the number.\" The Duke's first gift, in 1439, of one\r\n     hundred and twenty-nine treatises, was worth, according to\r\n     Wood, a thousand pounds. All his book presents, \"amounting\r\n     to above 600 (mostly treating of divinity, physic, history,\r\n     and humanity) which were from several parts of the world\r\n     obtained, were transmitted to the university, and for the\r\n     present laid up in chests in Cobham's library. The catalogue\r\n     also of them which were then sent, and the indentures for\r\n     the receipt of the said books, were laid up in the chest\r\n     called _Cista Librorum et Rotulorum_.\" _History_ (or Annals)\r\n     _of the University of Oxford_; vol. ii., pt. ii., 914.\r\n     Gutch's edit.

Leland has not forgotten this distinguished\r\n     bibliomaniac; for he thus lauds him in roman verse:\r\n\r\n          Tam clari meminit viri togata\r\n          Rectè Gallia; tum chorus suavis\r\n          Cygnorum Isidis ad vadum incolentûm\r\n          Cui magnum numerum dedit BONORUM\r\n          LIBRORUM, statuitque sanctiori\r\n          Divinus studio scholæ theatrum;\r\n          Nostro quale quidem videtur esse\r\n          Magnum tempore, forsan et futuro\r\n\r\n          _Cygn.

It is not to be wondered that learning drooped, and\r\nreligion \"waxed faint,\" 'midst the din of arms and the effusion of\r\nhuman blood. Yet towards the close of this reign some attempt was made\r\nto befriend the book cause; for the provost and fellows of Eton and\r\nCambridge petitioned the king to assist them in increasing the number\r\nof books in their libraries;[272] but the result of this petition has\r\nnever, I believe, been known.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 272: In the manuscript history of Eton College, in\r\n     the British Museum (_MSS. Donat._ 4840, p. 154.), the\r\n     Provost and Fellows of Eton and Cambridge are stated, in the\r\n     25th of Henry the Sixth, to have petitioned the king that,\r\n     as these new colleges were not sufficiently seised of books\r\n     for divine service, and for their libraries, he would be\r\n     pleased to order one of his chaplains, Richard Chestre, \"to\r\n     take to him such men as shall be seen to him expedient in\r\n     order to get knowledge where such bookes may be found,\r\n     paying a reasonable price for the same, and that the sayd\r\n     men might have the first choice of such bookes, ornaments,\r\n     &c., before any man, and in especiall of all manner of\r\n     bookes, ornaments, and other necessaries as now _late were\r\n     perteynyng to the Duke of Gloucester_, and that the king\r\n     would particular(ly) cause to be employed herein John Pye\r\n     his stacioner of London.\" For this anecdote I am indebted to\r\n     Sir H. Ellis. See also the interesting note in Warton's\r\n     _Hist. Engl. Poet._, diss. ii., sign. f. 2.]\r\n\r\nI had nearly passed through the reign of Henry the Sixth without\r\nnoticing the very meritorious labours of a sort of precursor of Dean\r\nColet; I mean, SIR WALTER SHERINGTON. He was a most assiduous\r\nbibliomaniac;[273] and, in the true spirit of ancient monachism,\r\nconceived that no cathedral could be perfect without a library.\r\nAccordingly, he not only brought together an extraordinary number of\r\ncurious books, but framed laws or regulations concerning the treatment\r\nof the books, and the hours of perusing them; which, if I can trust to\r\nmy memory, are rather curious, and worth your examination. They are in\r\nHearne's edition of the Antiquities of Glastonbury, composed in our\r\nown language.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 273: \"Over the east quadrant of this (great)\r\n     cloyster (on the north side of this church) was a fayre\r\n     librarie, builded at the costes and charges of (Sir) WALTAR\r\n     SHERINGTON, chancellor of the duchie of Lancaster, in the\r\n     raigne of Henrie the 6. which hath beene well furnished with\r\n     faire written books IN VELLEM: but few of them now do\r\n     remaine there.\" _Antiquities of Glastonbury_; Hearne's edit.\r\n     1722; p. 308.\r\n\r\n     _Regulations concerning Sherington's Library._\r\n\r\n     \"Quodque dicta libraria, hostiis ipsius per præfatos\r\n     capellanos custodes ejusdem, et eorum successores, aut\r\n     alterum ipsorum, apertis singulis diebus profestis annuatim\r\n     á festo Nativ. beat.

In the reign of EDWARD IV., our venerable and\r\nworthy Caxton fixed the first press that ever was set to work in this\r\ncountry, in the abbey of Westminster. Yes, Lorenzo; now commenced more\r\ndecidedly, the æra of BIBLIOMANIA! Now the rich, and comparatively\r\npoor, began to build them small _Book Rooms_ or _Libraries_. At first,\r\nboth the architecture and furniture were sufficiently rude, if I\r\nremember well the generality of wood cuts of ancient book-boudoirs:--a\r\nfew simple implements only being deemed necessary; and a three-legged\r\nstool, \"in fashion square or round,\" as Cowper[274] says, was thought\r\nluxury sufficient for the hard student to sit upon. Now commenced a\r\ngeneral love and patronage of books: now (to borrow John Fox's\r\nlanguage) \"tongues became known, knowledge grew, judgment increased,\r\nBOOKS WERE DISPERSED, the scripture was read, stories were opened,\r\ntimes compared, truth discerned, falsehood detected, and with finger\r\npointed (at)--and all, THROUGH THE BENEFIT OF PRINTING.\"[275]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 274: The entire passage is worth extraction: as it\r\n     well describes many an old stool which has served for many a\r\n     studious philosopher:\r\n\r\n          \"Joint stools were then created: on three legs\r\n          Upborne they stood. Three legs upholding firm\r\n          A massy slab, in fashion square or round.\r\n          On such a stool immortal Alfred sat,\r\n          And sway'd the sceptre of his infant realms.\r\n          And such in ancient halls and mansions drear\r\n          May still be seen; but perforated sore,\r\n          And drilled in holes, the solid oak is found,\r\n          By worms voracious eating through and through.\"\r\n\r\n          _Task_: b. i., v. 19, &c.\r\n\r\n     It had escaped the amiable and sagacious author of these\r\n     verses that such tripodical seats were frequently introduced\r\n     into OLD BOOK-ROOMS; as the subjoined print--which gives us\r\n     also a curious picture of one of the libraries alluded to by\r\n     Lysander--may serve to shew:\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: _Revelaciones Sancte Birgitte; ed. 1521,\r\n     sign. z. 3 rev._]]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 275: _Book of Martyrs_, vol. i., p. 927; edit.\r\n     1641.]\r\n\r\nLIS. Now you have arrived at this period, pray concentrate your\r\nanecdotes into a reasonable compass. As you have inveigled us into the\r\nprinting-office of Caxton, I am fearful, from your strong attachment\r\nto him, that we shall not get over the threshhold of it, into the open\r\nair again, until midnight.\r\n\r\nPHIL. Order, order, Lisardo! This is downright rudeness. I appeal to\r\nthe chair!--\r\n\r\nLORENZ. Lisardo is unquestionably reprehensible. His eagerness makes\r\nhim sometimes lose sight of good breeding.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. I was going to mention some _Vellum_ and _Presentation_\r\ncopies--but I shall hurry forward.\r\n\r\nLIS. Nay, if you love me, omit nothing about \"vellum and presentation\r\ncopies.\" Speak at large upon these glorious subjects.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Poor Lisardo!--we must build an iron cage to contain such a\r\nbook-madman as he promises to become!\r\n\r\nPHIL. Proceed, dear Lysander, and no longer heed these interruptions.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Nay, I was only about to observe that, as Caxton is known to\r\nhave printed _upon vellum_,[276] it is most probable that one of his\r\npresentation copies of the romances of _Jason and Godfrey of Boulogne_\r\n(executed under the patronage of Edward IV.), might have been printed\r\nin the same manner. Be this as it may, it seems reasonable to conclude\r\nthat Edward the Fourth was not only fond of books, as objects of\r\nbeauty or curiosity, but that he had some affection for literature and\r\nliterary characters; for how could the firm friend and generous\r\npatron of TIPTOFT, EARL of WORCESTER--with whom this monarch had spent\r\nmany a studious, as well as jovial, hour--be insensible to the charms\r\nof intellectual refinement! Pause we here for one moment--and let us\r\npour the juice of the blackest grape upon the votive tablet,\r\nconsecrated to the memory of this illustrious nobleman! and, as Caxton\r\nhas become so fashionable[277] among us, I will read to you, from\r\nyonder beautiful copy of his English edition of \"_Tully upon\r\nFriendship_,\" a part of our printer's affecting eulogy upon the\r\ntranslator:--\"O good blessed Lord God, what great loss was it of that\r\nnoble, virtuous, and well-disposed lord! When I remember and advertise\r\nhis life, his science, and his virtue, me thinketh God not displeased\r\nover a great loss of such a man, considering his estate and cunning,\"\r\n&c. \"At his death every man that was there, might learn to die and\r\ntake his (own) death patiently; wherein I hope and doubt not, but that\r\nGod received his soul into his everlasting bliss. For as I am informed\r\nhe right advisedly ordained all his things, as well for his last will\r\nof worldly goods, as for his soul's health; and patiently, and holily,\r\nwithout grudging, in charity, to fore that he departed out of this\r\nworld: which is gladsome and joyous to hear.\"--What say you to this\r\nspecimen of Caxtonian eloquence?\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 276: Consult the recent edition of the\r\n     _Typographical Antiquities_ of our own country: vol. i., p.\r\n     56, 137, 268.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 277: As a proof of the ardour with which the books\r\n     printed by him are now sought after, the reader shall judge\r\n     for himself--when he is informed that an imperfect copy of\r\n     the _Golden Legend_, one of Caxton's commonest productions,\r\n     produced at a book sale, a few months ago, the sum of\r\n     _twenty-seven_ guineas!]\r\n\r\nLIS. It has a considerable merit; but my attention has been a good\r\ndeal diverted, during your appropriate recital of it, to the beautiful\r\ncondition of the copy. Thrice happy Lorenzo! what sum will convey this\r\nvolume to my own library!\r\n\r\nLOREN. No offer, in the shape of money, shall take it hence. I am an\r\nenthusiast in the cause of Tiptoft; and am always upon the watch to\r\ndiscover any volume, printed by Caxton, which contains the composition\r\nof the hapless Earl of Worcester! Dr. Henry has spoken so handsomely\r\nof him, and Mr. Park, in his excellent edition of Walpole's Royal and\r\nNoble Authors,[278] has made his literary character so interesting\r\nthat, considering the dearth of early good English authors,[279] I\r\nknow of no other name that merits greater respect and admiration.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 278: Vol i., p. 200, &c. _History of Great\r\n     Britain_, by Dr. Henry, vol. x., p. 143, &c.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 279: \"In the library of Glastonbury abbey, in\r\n     1248, there were but four books in Engleish, &c. We have not\r\n     a single historian, in Engleish prose, before the reign of\r\n     Richard the Second; when John Treviza translateëd the\r\n     Polychronicon of Randal Higden. Boston of Bury, who seems to\r\n     have consulted all the monasterys in Engleland, does not\r\n     mention one author who had written in Engleish; and Bale, at\r\n     a lateër period, has, comparatively, but an insignificant\r\n     number: nor was Leland so fortunate as to find above two or\r\n     three Engleish books, in the monastick and other librarys,\r\n     which he rummage'd, and explore'd, under the king's\r\n     commission.\" Ritson's Dissertation on Romance and\r\n     Minstrelsy: prefixed to his _Ancient Engleish Metrical\r\n     Romanceës_, vol. i., p. lxxxi.]\r\n\r\nLYSAND. True; and this nobleman's attention to the acquisition of fine\r\nand useful books, when he was abroad, for the benefit of his own\r\ncountry,[280] gives him a distinguished place in the list of\r\nBIBLIOMANIACS. I dare say Lisardo would give some few hundred guineas\r\nfor his bust, executed by Flaxman, standing upon a pedestal composed\r\nof the original editions of his works, bound in grave-coloured morocco\r\nby his favourite Faulkener?[281]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 280: Dr. Henry's _History of Great Britain_;\r\n     _ibid._: from which a copious note has been given in the new\r\n     edition of our _Typographical Antiquities_; vol. i., p. 127,\r\n     &c.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 281: Henry Faulkener, no. 4, George Court, near\r\n     the Adelphi, in the Strand.

I entreat you not to inflame my imagination by such tantalizing\r\npictures! You know this must ever be a fiction: the most successful\r\nbibliomaniac never attained to such human happiness.\r\n\r\nPHIL. Leave Lisardo to his miseries, and proceed.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. I have supposed Edward to have spent some jovial hours with\r\nthis unfortunate nobleman. It is thought that our monarch and he\r\npartook of the superb feast which was given by the famous NEVELL,\r\narchbishop of York, at the inthronization of the latter; and I am\r\ncurious to know of what the library of such a munificent\r\necclesiastical character was composed! But perhaps this feast\r\nitself[282] is one of Lisardo's fictions.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 282: Lysander is perfectly correct about the feast\r\n     which was given at the archbishop's inthronization; as the\r\n     particulars of it--\"out of an old paper roll in the archives\r\n     of the Bodleian library,\" are given by Hearne in the sixth\r\n     volume of _Leland's Collectanea_, p. 1-14: and a most\r\n     extraordinary and amusing bill of fare it is. The last\r\n     twenty dinners given by the Lord Mayors at Guildhall, upon\r\n     the first day of their mayoralties, were only\r\n     _sandwiches_--compared with such a repast! What does the\r\n     reader think of 2000 chickens, 4000 pigeons, 4000 coneys,\r\n     500 \"and mo,\" stags, bucks, and roes, with 4000 \"pasties of\r\n     venison colde?\"--and these barely an 18th part of the kind\r\n     of meats served up! At the high table our amiable EARL of\r\n     WORCESTER was seated, with the Archbishop, three Bishops,\r\n     the Duke of Suffolk, and the Earl of Oxford. The fictitious\r\n     archiepiscopal feast was the one intended to be given by\r\n     NEVELL to Edward IV.; when the latter \"appointed a day to\r\n     come to hunt in More in Hertfordshire, and make merry with\r\n     him.\" Nevell made magnificent preparations for the royal\r\n     visit; but instead of receiving the monarch as a guest, he\r\n     was saluted by some of his officers, who \"arrested him for\r\n     treason,\" and imprisoned him at Calais and Guisnes. The\r\n     cause of this sudden, and apparently monstrous, conduct, on\r\n     the part of Edward, has not been told by Stow (_Chronicles_,\r\n     p. 426; edit. 1615), nor by Godwyn, (_Catalogue of the\r\n     Bishops of England_, p. 481, edit. 1601): both of whom\r\n     relate the fact with singular naiveté. I have a strong\r\n     suspicion that Nevell was so far a bibliomaniac as to have\r\n     had a curious collection of _astrological books_; for \"there\r\n     was greate correspondency betweene this Archbishop and the\r\n     Hermetique philosophers of his time; and this is partly\r\n     confirmed to me from Ripley's dedication of his '_Medulla_'\r\n     to him, ann. 1746; as also the presentation of Norton's\r\n     '_Ordinall_,'\" &c. Thus writes Ashmole, in his _Theatrum\r\n     Chemicum_, p. 455.]\r\n\r\nEnough has probably been said of Edward. We will stop, therefore, but\r\na minute, to notice the completion of the HUMPHREY LIBRARY, and the\r\nbibliomaniacal spirit of master RICHARD COURTNEY,[283] during the same\r\nreign; and give but another minute to the mention of the statute of\r\nRICHARD III. in protection of English printers,[284] when we reach the\r\nAUGUSTAN BOOK-AGE, in the reign of HENRY VII.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 283: Speaking of the public library of Oxford, at\r\n     this period, Hearne tells us, from a letter sent by him to\r\n     Thomas Baker, that there was \"a chaplein of the Universitie\r\n     chosen, after the maner of a Bedell, and to him was the\r\n     custodie of the librarye committed, his stipend--cvi_s_. and\r\n     viii_d_. his apparell found him _de secta generosorum_.

When Lysander talks,\r\n     above, of the reign of Henry the Seventh being the \"AUGUSTAN\r\n     AGE for BOOKS,\" he must be supposed to allude to the\r\n     facility and beauty of publishing them by means of THE\r\n     PRESS: for at this period, abroad, the typographical\r\n     productions of Verard, Eustace, Vostre, Bonfons, Pigouchet,\r\n     Regnier, and many others (\"quæ nunc perscribere longum est\")\r\n     were imitated, and sometimes equalled by W. de Worde,\r\n     Pynson, and Notary, at home. In regard to _intellectual_\r\n     fame, if my authority be good, \"in the reign of Henry VII.\r\n     Greek was a stranger in both universities; and so little\r\n     even of Latin had Cambridge, of its own growth, that it had\r\n     not types sufficient to furnish out the common letters and\r\n     epistles of the University. They usually employed an\r\n     Italian, one Caius Auberinus, to compose them, whose\r\n     ordinarry [Transcriber's Note: ordinary] fee was twentypence\r\n     a letter.\" (MSS. in Benet College Library, lib.

Before we proceed to discuss the bibliomaniacal ravages of this\r\nage, we had better retire, with Lorenzo's leave, to the DRAWING-ROOM;\r\nto partake of a beverage less potent than that which is now before us.\r\n\r\nLORENZ. Just as you please. But I should apprehend that Lysander could\r\nhold out 'till he reached the Reformation;--and, besides, I am not\r\nsure whether our retreat be quite ready for us.\r\n\r\nLIS. Pray let us not take leave of all these beauteous books, and\r\nbusts, and pictures, just at present. If Lysander's lungs will bear\r\nhim out another twenty minutes, we shall, by that time, have reached\r\nthe Reformation; and then \"our retreat,\" as Lorenzo calls it, may be\r\nquite ready for our reception.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Settle it between yourselves. But I think I could hold out for\r\nanother twenty minutes--since you will make me your only book-orator.\r\n\r\nLORENZ. Let it be so, then. I will order the lamps to be lit; so that\r\nLisardo may see his favourite Wouvermans and Berghems, in company with\r\nmy romances, (which latter are confined in my satin-wood book-case) to\r\nevery possible degree of perfection!\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Provided you indulge me also with a sight of these delightful\r\nobjects, you shall have what you desire:--and thus I proceed:\r\n\r\nOf the great passion of HENRY THE VIITH for fine books, even before he\r\nascended the throne of England,[285] there is certainly no doubt. And\r\nwhile he was king, we may judge, even from the splendid fragments of\r\nhis library, which are collected in the British Museum, of the nicety\r\nof his taste, and of the soundness of his judgment. That he should\r\nlove extravagant books of devotion,[286] as well as histories and\r\nchronicles, must be considered the fault of the age, rather than of\r\nthe individual. I will not, however, take upon me to say that the\r\nslumbers of this monarch were disturbed in consequence of the\r\nextraordinary and frightful passages, which, accompanied with bizarre\r\ncuts,[287] were now introduced into almost every work, both of\r\nascetic divinity and also of plain practical morality. His\r\npredecessor, Richard, had in all probability been alarmed by the\r\nimages which the reading of these books had created; and I guess that\r\nit was from such frightful objects, rather than from the ghosts of his\r\nmurdered brethren, that he was compelled to pass a sleepless night\r\nbefore the memorable battle of Bosworth Field. If one of those\r\nartists who used to design the horrible pictures which are engraved in\r\nmany old didactic volumes of this period had ventured to take a peep\r\ninto Richard's tent, I question whether he would not have seen, lying\r\nupon an oaken table, an early edition of some of those fearful works\r\nof which he had himself aided in the embellishment, and of which\r\nHeinecken has given us such curious fac-similes:[288]--and this, in my\r\nhumble apprehension, is quite sufficient to account for all the\r\nterrible workings in Richard, which Shakespeare has so vividly\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 285: Mr. Heber has a fine copy of one of the\r\n     volumes of a black-letter edition of Froissart, printed by\r\n     Eustace, upon the exterior of the binding of which are\r\n     HENRY'S arms, with his name--HENRICVS DVX RICHMVNDIÆ. The\r\n     very view of such a book, while it gives comfort to a\r\n     low-spirited bibliomaniac, adds energy to the perseverance\r\n     of a young collector! the latter of whom fondly, but vainly,\r\n     thinks he may one day be blessed with a similar treasure!]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 286: The possession of such a volume as \"_The\r\n     Revelations of the monk of Euesham_\" (vide vol. ii., of the\r\n     new edition of _Brit. Typog. Antiquities_), is evidence\r\n     sufficient of Henry's attachment to extravagant books of\r\n     devotion.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 287: It is certainly one of the comforts of modern\r\n     education, that girls and boys have nothing to do, even in\r\n     the remotest villages, with the perusal of such books as\r\n     were put into the juvenile hands of those who lived towards\r\n     the conclusion of the 15th century. One is at a loss to\r\n     conceive how the youth of that period could have ventured at\r\n     night out of doors, or slept alone in a darkened room,\r\n     without being frightened out of their wits! Nor could\r\n     maturer life be uninfluenced by reading such volumes as are\r\n     alluded to in the text: and as to the bed of death--_that_\r\n     must have sometimes shaken the stoutest faith, and disturbed\r\n     the calmest piety. For what can be more terrible, and at the\r\n     same time more audacious, than human beings arrogating to\r\n     themselves the powers of the deity, and denouncing, in\r\n     equivocal cases, a certainty and severity of future\r\n     punishment, equally revolting to scripture and common sense?\r\n     To drive the timid into desperation, and to cut away the\r\n     anchor of hope from the rational believer, seem, among other\r\n     things, to have been the objects of these \"ascetic\" authors;\r\n     while the pictures, which were suffered to adorn their\r\n     printed works, confirmed the wish that, where the reader\r\n     might not comprehend the text, he could understand its\r\n     illustration by means of a print. I will give two extracts,\r\n     and one of these \"bizarre cuts,\" in support of the preceding\r\n     remarks. At page 168, ante, the reader will find a slight\r\n     mention of the subject: he is here presented with a more\r\n     copious illustration of it. \"In likewise there is none that\r\n     may declare the piteous and horrible cries and howlings the\r\n     which that is made in hell, as well of devils as of other\r\n     damned. And if that a man demand what they say in crying;\r\n     the answer: All the damned curseth the Creator. Also they\r\n     curse together as their father and their mother, and the\r\n     hour that they were begotten, and that they were born, and\r\n     that they were put unto nourishing, and those that them\r\n     should correct and teach, and also those the which have been\r\n     the occasion of their sins, as the bawd, cursed be the bawd,\r\n     and also of other occasions in diverse sins. The second\r\n     cause of the cry of them damned is for the consideration\r\n     that they have of the time of mercy, the which is past, in\r\n     the which they may do penance and purchase paradise.

I should imagine that his mind was not\r\nmuch affected by the perusal of this description of books: but rather\r\nthat he was constantly meditating upon some old arithmetical work--the\r\nprototype of Cocker--which, in the desolation of the ensuing half\r\ncentury, has unfortunately perished. Yet, if this monarch be accused\r\nof avaricious propensities--if, in consequence of speculating deeply\r\nin _large paper_ and _vellum_ copies, he made his coffers to run over\r\nwith gold--it must be remembered that he was, at the same time, a\r\npatron as well as judge of architectural artists; and while the\r\ncompletion of the structure of King's college Chapel, Cambridge, and\r\nthe building of his own magnificent chapel[289] at Westminster (in\r\nwhich latter, I suspect, he had a curiously-carved gothic closet for\r\nthe preservation of choice copies from Caxton's neighbouring press),\r\nafford decisive proofs of Henry's skill in matters of taste, the\r\nrivalship of printers and of book-buyers shews that the example of the\r\nmonarch was greatly favourable to the propagation of the Bibliomania.\r\nIndeed, such was the progress of the book-disease that, in the very\r\nyear of Henry's death, appeared, for the first time in this country,\r\nan edition of _The Ship of Fools_--in which work, ostentatious and\r\nignorant book-collectors[290] are, amongst other characters, severely\r\nsatirized.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 289: Harpsfield speaks with becoming truth and\r\n     spirit of Henry's great attention to ecclesiastical\r\n     establishments: \"Splendidum etiam illud sacellum\r\n     westmonasterij, magno sumptu atque magnificentia ab eodem\r\n     est conditum.

His enthusiasm so frequently made him violate the rules of\r\nsevere politeness; and the quickness with which he flew from one\r\nsubject to another, might have offended a narrator of the gravity,\r\nwithout the urbanity, of Lysander; had not the frankness with which he\r\nconfessed his faults, and the warmth with which he always advocated\r\nthe cause of literature, rendered him amiable in the eyes of those who\r\nthoroughly knew him. The friends, whose company he was now enjoying,\r\nwere fully competent to appreciate his worth. They perceived that\r\nLisardo's mind had been rather brilliantly cultivated; and that, as\r\nhis heart had always beaten at the call of virtue, so, in a due\r\ncourse of years, his judgment would become matured, and his opinions\r\nmore decidedly fixed. He had been left, very early in life, without a\r\nfather, and bred up in the expectation of a large fortune; while the\r\nexcessive fondness of his mother had endeavoured to supply the want of\r\npaternal direction, and had encouraged her child to sigh for every\r\nthing short of impossibility for his gratification.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, Lisardo was placed at College upon the most\r\nrespectable footing. He wore the velvet cap, and enjoyed the rustling\r\nof the tassels upon his silk gown, as he paraded the High street of\r\nOxford. But although he could translate Tacitus and Theocritus with\r\ncreditable facility, he thought it more advantageous to gratify the\r\ncravings of his body than of his mind. He rode high-mettled horses; he\r\nshot with a gun which would have delighted an Indian prince; he drank\r\nfreely out of cut-glasses, which were manufactured according to his\r\nown particular taste; and wines of all colours and qualities sparkled\r\nupon his table; he would occasionally stroll into the Bodleian Library\r\nand Picture Gallery, in order to know whether any acquisitions had\r\nbeen recently made to them; and attended the Concerts when any\r\nperformer came down from London. Yet, in the midst of all his gaiety,\r\nLisardo passed more sombrous than joyous hours: for when he looked\r\ninto a book, he would sometimes meet with an electrical sentence from\r\nCicero, Seneca, or Johnson, from which he properly inferred that life\r\nwas uncertain, and that time was given us to prepare for eternity.\r\n\r\nHe grew dissatisfied and melancholy. He scrambled through his terms;\r\ntook his degree; celebrated his anniversary of twenty-one, by\r\ndrenching his native village in ale which had been brewed at his\r\nbirth; added two wings to his father's house; launched out into coin\r\nand picture collecting; bought fine books with fine bindings; then\r\nsold all his coins and pictures; and, at the age of twenty-five, began\r\nto read, and think, and act for himself.\r\n\r\nAt this crisis, he became acquainted with the circle which has already\r\nbeen introduced to the reader's attention; and to which circle the\r\nsame reader may think it high time now to return.\r\n\r\nUpon breaking up for THE DRAWING ROOM, it was amusing to behold the\r\nvivacity of Lisardo; who, leaping about Lysander, and expressing his\r\nhigh gratification at the discourse he had already heard, and his\r\npleasure at what he hoped yet to hear, reminded us of what Boswell has\r\nsaid of Garrick, who used to flutter about Dr. Johnson, and try to\r\nsoften his severity by a thousand winning gestures.\r\n\r\nThe doors were opened; and we walked into Lorenzo's Drawing Room. The\r\nreader is not to figure to himself a hundred fantastical and fugitive\r\npieces of furniture, purchased at Mr. Oakley's, and set off with\r\ncurtains, carpet, and looking-glasses--at a price which would have\r\nmaintained a country town of seven hundred poor with bread and soup\r\nduring the hardest winter--the reader will not suppose that a man of\r\nLorenzo's taste, who called books his best wealth, would devote two\r\nthousand pounds to such idle trappings; which in the course of three\r\nyears, at farthest, would lose their comfort by losing their fashion.\r\nBut he will suppose that elegance and propriety were equally consulted\r\nby our host.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, a satin-wood book-case of 14 feet in width and 11 in\r\nheight, ornamented at the top with a few chaste Etruscan vases--a\r\nlight blue carpet, upon which were depicted bunches of grey roses,\r\nshadowed in brown--fawn-coloured curtains, relieved with yellow silk\r\nand black velvet borders--alabaster lamps shedding their soft light\r\nupon small marble busts--and sofas and chairs corresponding with the\r\ncurtains--(and upon which a visitor might sit without torturing the\r\nnerves of the owner of them) these, along with some genuine pictures\r\nof Wouvermans, Berghem, and Rysdael, and a few other (subordinate)\r\nornaments, formed the furniture of Lorenzo's Drawing Room. As it was\r\n_en suite_ with the library, which was fitted up in a grave style or\r\ncharacter, the contrast was sufficiently pleasing.\r\n\r\nLisardo ran immediately to the book-case. He first eyed, with a greedy\r\nvelocity, the backs of the folios and quartos; then the octavos; and,\r\nmounting an ingeniously-contrived mahogany rostrum, which moved with\r\nthe utmost facility, he did not fail to pay due attention to the\r\nduodecimos; some of which were carefully preserved in Russia or\r\nmorocco backs, with water-tabby silk linings, and other appropriate\r\nembellishments. In the midst of his book-reverie, he heard, on a\r\nsudden, the thrilling notes of a harp--which proceeded from the\r\nfurther end of the library!--it being Lorenzo's custom, upon these\r\noccasions, to request an old Welch servant to bring his instrument\r\ninto the library, and renew, if he could, the strains of \"other\r\ntimes.\" Meanwhile the curtains were \"let fall;\" the sofa wheeled\r\nround;\r\n\r\n               --and the cups\r\n     That cheer, but not inebriate,\r\n\r\nwith \"the bubbling and loud hissing urn,\" \"welcomed the evening in.\"\r\nLorenzo brought from his library a volume of Piranesi, and another of\r\nengravings from the heads of Vandyke. Lisardo, in looking at them,\r\nbeat time with his head and foot; and Philemon and Lysander\r\nacknowledged that Dr. Johnson himself could never have so much enjoyed\r\nthe beverage which was now before them.\r\n\r\nIf it should here be asked, by the critical reader, why our society is\r\nnot described as being more congenial, by the presence of those \"whom\r\nman was born to please,\" the answer is at once simple and\r\ntrue--Lorenzo was a bachelor; and his sisters, knowing how long and\r\ndesperate would be our discussion upon the black letter and white\r\nletter, had retreated, in the morning, to spend the day with Lisardo's\r\nmother--whither ---- ---- had been invited to join them.\r\n\r\nThe harper had now ceased. The tea-things were moved away; when we\r\nnarrowed our circle, and, two of us upon the sofa, and three upon\r\nchairs, entreated Lysander to resume his narrative; who, after\r\n\"clearing his pipes (like Sir Roger de Coverley) with a loud hem or\r\ntwo,\" thus proceeded.\r\n\r\n\"I think we left off,\" said Lysander, \"with seating HENRY THE EIGHTH\r\nupon the throne of England. It will be as well, therefore, to say\r\nsomething of this monarch's pretensions to scholarship and love of\r\nbooks. Although I will not rake together every species of abuse which\r\nhas been vented against him by one Anthony Gilbie,[291] yet Henry must\r\nbe severely censured, in the estimation of the most candid inquirer,\r\nfor that gross indifference which he evinced to the real interests of\r\nliterature, in calmly suffering the libraries of convents and\r\nmonasteries to be pillaged by the crafty and rapacious. He was\r\nbibliomaniac enough to have a few copies of his own work, in defence\r\nof the Roman Catholic exposition of the Sacrament, struck off UPON\r\nVELLUM:[292] but when he quarrelled with the Roman pontiff about his\r\ndivorce from Queen Catharine, in order to marry Anne Boleyn,[293] he\r\nsounded the tocsin for the eventful destruction of all monastic\r\nlibraries: and although he had sent Leland, under an express\r\ncommission, to make a due examination of them, as well as a\r\nstatistical survey of the realm, yet, being frustrated in the\r\nforementioned darling object, he cared for nothing about books,\r\nwhether _upon vellum_ or _large paper_. But had we not better speak of\r\nthe book ravages, during the reformation, in their proper place?\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 291: \"In the time (saith he) of King HENRIE THE\r\n     EIGHT, when by Tindall, Frith, Bilney, and other his\r\n     faithful seruantes, God called England to dresse his\r\n     vineyarde, many promise ful faire, whome I coulde name, but\r\n     what fruite followed? Nothing but bitter grapes, yea, bryers\r\n     and brambles, the wormewood of auarice, the gall of\r\n     crueltie, the poison of filthie fornication, flowing from\r\n     head to fote, the contempt of God, and open defence of the\r\n     cake idole, by open proclamation to be read in the churches\r\n     in steede of God's Scriptures. Thus was there no\r\n     reformation, but a deformation, in the time of the tyrant\r\n     and lecherouse monster. The bore I graunt was busie,\r\n     wrooting and digging in the earth, and all his pigges that\r\n     followed him, but they sought onely for the pleasant\r\n     fruites, that they winded with their long snoutes; and for\r\n     their own bellies sake, they wrooted up many weeds; but they\r\n     turned the grounde so, mingling goode and badde togeather,\r\n     sweet and sower, medecine and poyson, they made, I saye,\r\n     suche confusion of religion and lawes, that no good thinge\r\n     could growe, but by great miracle, under suche gardeners.\r\n     And no maruaile, if it be rightlye considered. For this bore\r\n     raged against God, against the Divell, against Christe, and\r\n     against Antichrist, as the fome that he cast oute against\r\n     Luther, the racing out of the name of the pope, and yet\r\n     allowing his lawes, and his murder of many Christian\r\n     souldiars, and of many Papists, doe declare and evidentlie\r\n     testifie unto us; especially the burning of Barnes, Jerome,\r\n     and Garrette, their faithfull preachers of the truthe, and\r\n     hanging the same daye for the maintenaunce of the pope,\r\n     Poel, Abel, and Fetherstone, dothe clearlie painte his\r\n     beastlines, that he cared for no religion. This monsterous\r\n     bore for all this must needes be called the head of the\r\n     church in paine of treason, displacing Christ, our onely\r\n     head, who ought alone to haue this title.\" _Admonition to\r\n     England and Scotland, &c._, Geneva, 1558, p. 69.

When all these things were\r\n     thus ordered, came in the Duke of Suffolk and the Lord\r\n     William Howard on horseback, and the Serjeants of arms\r\n     before them, and after them the sewer; and then the knights\r\n     of the Bath, bringing in the _first course_, which was eight\r\n     and twenty dishes, besides subtleties, and ships made of\r\n     wax, marvellous gorgeous to behold: all which time of\r\n     service, the trumpets standing in the window, at the nether\r\n     end of the hall, played,\" &c. _Chronicles_; p. 566: edit.\r\n     1615, fol.]\r\n\r\nLORENZ. As you please. Perhaps you will go on with the mention of some\r\ndistinguished patrons 'till you arrive at that period?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Yes; we may now as well notice the efforts of that\r\nextraordinary _bibliomaniacal triumvirate_, Colet, More, and Erasmus.\r\n\r\nPHIL. Pray treat copiously of them. They are my great favourites. But\r\ncan you properly place Erasmus in the list?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. You forget that he made a long abode here, and was Greek\r\nprofessor at Cambridge. To begin, then, with the former. COLET, as you\r\nwell know, was Dean of St. Paul's; and founder of the public school\r\nwhich goes by the latter name. He had an ardent and general love of\r\nliterature;[294] but his attention to the improvement of youth, in\r\nsuperintending appropriate publications, for their use, was\r\nunremitting. Few men did so much and so well, at this period: for\r\nwhile he was framing the statutes by which his little community was to\r\nbe governed, he did not fail to keep the presses of Wynkyn De Worde\r\nand Pynson pretty constantly at work, by publishing the grammatical\r\ntreatises of Grocyn, Linacre, Stanbridge, Lilye, Holte, Whittington,\r\nand others--for the benefit, as well of the public, as of his own\r\nparticular circle. I take it, his library must have been both choice\r\nand copious; for books now began to be multiplied in an immense ratio,\r\nand scholars and men of rank thought _a Study_, or _Library_, of some\r\nimportance to their mansions. What would we not give for an\r\nauthenticated representation of Dean Colet in his library,[295]\r\nsurrounded with books? You, Lisardo, would be in ecstacies with such a\r\nthing!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 294: How anxiously does COLET seem to have watched\r\n     the progress, and pushed the sale, of his friend Erasmus's\r\n     first edition of the Greek Testament! \"Quod scribis de Novo\r\n     Testamento intelligo. Et libri novæ editionis tuæ _hic avide\r\n     emuntur et passim leguntur_!\" The entire epistle (which may\r\n     be seen in Dr. Knight's dry Life of Colet, p. 315) is\r\n     devoted to an account of Erasmus's publications. \"I am\r\n     really astonished, my dear Erasmus (does he exclaim), at the\r\n     fruitfulness of your talents; that, without any fixed\r\n     residence, and with a precarious and limited income, you\r\n     contrive to publish so many and such excellent works.\"\r\n     Adverting to the distracted state of Germany at this period,\r\n     and to the wish of his friend to live secluded and\r\n     unmolested, he observes--\"As to the tranquil retirement\r\n     which you sigh for, be assured that you have my sincere\r\n     wishes for its rendering you as happy and composed as you\r\n     can wish it. Your age and erudition entitle you to such a\r\n     retreat. I fondly hope, indeed, that you will choose this\r\n     country for it, and come and live amongst us, whose\r\n     disposition you know, and whose friendship you have proved.\"\r\n     There is hardly a more curious picture of the custom of the\r\n     times relating to the education of boys, than the Dean's own\r\n     Statutes for the regulation of St. Paul's School, which he\r\n     had founded. These shew, too, the _popular books_ then read\r\n     by the learned. \"The children shall come unto the school in\r\n     the morning at seven of the clock, both winter and summer,\r\n     and tarry there until eleven; and return again at one of the\r\n     clock, and depart at five, &c. In the school, no time in the\r\n     year, they shall use tallow candle, in no wise, but _only\r\n     wax candle_, at the costs of their friends. Also I will they\r\n     bring no meat nor drink, nor bottle, nor use in the school\r\n     no breakfasts, nor drinkings, in the time of learning, in no\r\n     wise, &c. I will they use no cockfighting, nor riding about\r\n     of victory, nor disputing at Saint Bartholomew, which is but\r\n     foolish babbling and loss of time.\" The master is then\r\n     restricted, under the penalty of 40 shillings, from granting\r\n     the boys a holiday, or \"remedy\" (play-day), as it is here\r\n     called, \"except the king, an archbishop, or a bishop,\r\n     present in his own person in the school, desire it.\" The\r\n     studies for the lads were \"Erasmus's _Copia_ et _Institutum\r\n     Christiani Hominii_ (composed at the Dean's request),\r\n     _Lactantius_, _Prudentius_, _Juvencus_, _Proba_ and\r\n     _Sedulius_, and _Baptista Mantuanus_, and such other as\r\n     shall be thought convenient and most to purpose unto the\r\n     true Latin speech; all barbary, all corruption, all Latin\r\n     adulterate, which ignorant blind fools brought into this\r\n     world, and with the same hath distained and poisoned the old\r\n     Latin speech, and the _veray_ Roman tongue, which in the\r\n     time of Tully, and Sallust, and Virgil, and Terence, was\r\n     used--I say, that filthiness, and all such abusion, which\r\n     the later blind world brought in, which more rather may be\r\n     called BLOTERATURE than LITERATURE, I utterly banish and\r\n     exclude out of THIS SCHOOL.\" Knight's _Life of Colet_, 362,\r\n     4. The sagacious reader will naturally enough conclude that\r\n     boys, thus educated, would, afterwards, of necessity, fall\r\n     victims to the ravages of the BIBLIOMANIA!]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 295: I wish it were in my power to come forward\r\n     with any stronger degree of probability than the exhibition\r\n     of the subjoined cut, of what might have been the interior\r\n     of _Dean Colet's Study_. This print is taken from an old\r\n     work, printed in the early part of the sixteenth century,\r\n     and republished in a book of Alciatus's emblems, translated\r\n     from the Latin into Italian, A.D. 1549, 8vo. There is an air\r\n     of truth about it; but the frame work is entirely modern,\r\n     and perhaps not in the purest taste. It may turn out that\r\n     this interior view of a private library is somewhat too\r\n     perfect and finished for the times of Colet, in this\r\n     country; especially if we may judge from the rules to be\r\n     observed in completing a public one, just about the period\r\n     of Colet's death: \"Md. couenawntyd and agreid wyth Comell\r\n     Clerke, for the making off the dextis in the library, (of\r\n     Christ Church College, Oxford) to the summe off xvi, after\r\n     the maner and forme as they be in Magdalyn college, except\r\n     the popie heedes off the seites, this to be workmanly\r\n     wrought and clenly, and he to have all manner off stooff\r\n     foond hym, and to have for the makyng off one dexte xs.\r\n     the sum off the hole viii. li.

Of this amiable and illustrious character I will only further\r\nobserve that he possessed solid, good sense--unaffected and unshaken\r\npiety--a love towards the whole human race--and that he dignified his\r\nattachment to learning by the conscientious discharge of his duty\r\ntowards God and man. He sleeps in peace beneath a monument, which has\r\nbeen consecrated by the tears of all who were related to him, and by\r\nthe prayers of those who have been benefitted by his philanthropy.\r\n\r\nOf SIR THOMAS MORE,[296] where is the schoolboy that is ignorant? He\r\nwas unquestionably, next to Erasmus, the most brilliant scholar of his\r\nage: while the precious biographical memoirs of him, which have\r\nluckily descended to us, place his character, in a domestic point of\r\nview, beyond that of all his contemporaries. Dr. Wordsworth[297] has\r\nwell spoken of \"the heavenly mindedness\" of More: but how are\r\nbibliomaniacs justly to appreciate the classical lore, and\r\nincessantly-active book-pursuits,[298] of this scholar and martyr! How\r\nhe soared \"above his compeers!\" How richly, singularly, and\r\ncuriously, was his mind furnished! Wit, playfulness, elevation, and\r\nforce--all these are distinguishable in his writings, if we except his\r\npolemical compositions; which latter, to speak in the gentlest terms,\r\nare wholly unworthy of his name. When More's head was severed from his\r\nbody, virtue and piety exclaimed, in the language of Erasmus,--\"He is\r\ndead: More, whose breast was purer than snow, whose genius was\r\nexcellent above all his nation.\"[299]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Behold him going to execution--his beloved daughter\r\n(Mrs. Roper) rushing through the guards, to take her last embrace.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 296: In the first volume of my edition of SIR\r\n     THOMAS MORE'S _Utopia_, the reader will find an elaborate\r\n     and faithful account of the biographical publications\r\n     relating to this distinguished character, together with a\r\n     copious _Catalogue Raisonnè_ of the engraved portraits of\r\n     him, and an analysis of his English works. It would be\r\n     tedious to both the reader and author, here to repeat what\r\n     has been before written of Sir Thomas More--whose memory\r\n     lives in every cultivated bosom. Of this edition of the\r\n     Utopia there appeared a flimsy and tart censure in the\r\n     _Edinburgh Review_, by a critic, who, it was manifest, had\r\n     never examined the volumes, and who, when he observes upon\r\n     the fidelity of Bishop Burnet's translation of the original\r\n     Latin of More, was resolved, from pure love of Whiggism, to\r\n     defend an author at the expense of truth.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 297: I have read this newly published biographical\r\n     memoir of Sir Thomas More: which contains nothing very new,\r\n     or deserving of particular notice in this place.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 298: A bibliomanical anecdote here deserves to be\r\n     recorded; as it shews how More's love of books had infected\r\n     even those who came to seize upon him to carry him to the\r\n     Tower, and to endeavour to inveigle him into treasonable\r\n     expressions:--\"While Sir Richard Southwell and Mr. Palmer\r\n     were bussie in _trussinge upp his bookes_, Mr. Riche,\r\n     pretending,\" &c.--\"Whereupon Mr. Palmer, on his desposition,\r\n     said, that he was soe bussie about the _trussinge upp Sir\r\n     Tho.

You remember well,\r\nLisardo,--we saw, in yonder room, a _large paper_ copy of the fine\r\nLeyden edition of this great man's works! You opened it; and were\r\nstruck with the variety--the solidity, as well as gaiety, of his\r\nproductions.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 300: It were much to be wished that Mr. Roscoe,\r\n     who has so successfully turned his attention to the history\r\n     of _Italian Literature_, of the period of Erasmus, would\r\n     devote himself to the investigation of the philological\r\n     history of the German schools, and more especially to the\r\n     literary life of the great man of whom Lysander is above\r\n     speaking. The biographical memoirs of Erasmus by Le Clerc,\r\n     anglicised and enlarged by the learned Jortin, and Dr.\r\n     Knight's life of the same, can never become popular. They\r\n     want method, style and interest. Le Clerc, however, has made\r\n     ample amends for the defectiveness of his biographical\r\n     composition, by the noble edition of Erasmus's works which\r\n     he put forth at Leyden, in the year 1703-6, in eleven\r\n     volumes folio: of which volumes the reader will find an\r\n     excellent analysis or review in the _Act. Erudit._, A.D.\r\n     1704, &c. Le Clerc, _Bibl. Choisie_, vol. i., 380; Du Pin's\r\n     _Bibl. Eccles._, vol. xiv., and _Biblioth. Fabric_, pt. i.,\r\n     359; from which latter we learn that, in the public library,\r\n     at Deventer, there is a copy of Erasmus's works, in which\r\n     those passages, where the author speaks freely of the laxity\r\n     of the monkish character, have been defaced, \"chartâ\r\n     fenestrata.\" A somewhat more compressed analysis of the\r\n     contents of these volumes appeared in the _Sylloge\r\n     Opusculorum Hist.-Crit., Literariorum, J.A. Fabricii, Hamb._\r\n     1738, 4to., p. 363, 378--preceded, however, by a pleasing,\r\n     yet brief account of the leading features of Erasmus's\r\n     literary life. Tn one of his letters to Colet, Erasmus\r\n     describes himself as \"a very poor fellow in point of\r\n     fortune, and wholly exempt from ambition.\" A little before\r\n     his death he sold his library to one John a Lasco, a\r\n     Polonese, for only 200 florins. (Of this amiable foreigner,\r\n     see Stypye's [Transcriber's Note: Strype's] _Life of\r\n     Crammer_ [Transcriber's Note: Cranmer]; b. ii., ch. xxii.)\r\n     Nor did he--notwithstanding his services to booksellers--and\r\n     although every press was teeming with his lucubrations--and\r\n     especially that of Colinæeus--(which alone put forth 24,000\r\n     copies of his _Colloquies_) ever become much the wealthier\r\n     for his talents as an author. His bibliomaniacal spirit was\r\n     such, that he paid most liberally those who collated or\r\n     described works of which he was in want. In another of his\r\n     letters, he declares that \"he shall not recieve\r\n     [Transcriber's Note: receive] an _obolus_ that year; as he\r\n     had spent more than what he had gained in rewarding those\r\n     who had made book-researches for him;\" and he complains,\r\n     after being five months at Cambridge, that he had,\r\n     fruitlessly, spent upwards of fifty crowns. \"Noblemen,\" says\r\n     he, \"love and praise literature, and my lucubrations; but\r\n     they praise and do not reward.\" To his friend Eobanus Hessus\r\n     (vol. vi., 25), he makes a bitter complaint \"de Comite\r\n     quodam.\" For the particulars, see the last mentioned\r\n     authority, p. 363, 4. In the year 1519, Godenus, to whom\r\n     Erasmus had bequeathed a silver bowl, put forth a facetious\r\n     catalogue of his works, in hexameter and pentameter verses;\r\n     which was printed at Louvain by Martin, without date, in\r\n     4to.; and was soon succeeded by two more ample and\r\n     methodical ones by the same person in 1537, 4to.; printed by\r\n     Froben and Episcopius. See Marchand's _Dict. Bibliogr. et\r\n     Histor._, vol. i., p. 98, 99. The bibliomaniac may not\r\n     object to be informed that Froben, shortly after the death\r\n     of his revered Erasmus, put forth this first edition of the\r\n     entire works of the latter, in nine folio volumes; and that\r\n     accurate and magnificent as is Le Clerc's edition of the\r\n     same (may I venture to hint at the rarity of LARGE PAPER\r\n     copies of it?), \"it takes no notice of the _Index\r\n     Expurgatorius_ of the early edition of Froben, which has\r\n     shown a noble art of curtailing this, as well as other\r\n     authors.\" See _Knight's Life of Erasmus_, p. 353. The\r\n     mention of Froben and Erasmus, thus going down to\r\n     immortality together, induces me to inform the curious\r\n     reader that my friend Mr. Edwards is possessed of a chaste\r\n     and elegant painting, by Fuseli, of this distinguished\r\n     author and printer--the portraits being executed after the\r\n     most authentic representations. Erasmus is in the act of\r\n     calmly correcting the press, while Froben is urging with\r\n     vehemence some emendations which he conceives to be of\r\n     consequence, but to which his master seems to pay no\r\n     attention! And now having presented the reader (p. 221,\r\n     ante) with the _supposed_ study of Colet, nothing remains\r\n     but to urge him to enter in imagination, with myself, into\r\n     the _real_ study of Erasmus; of which we are presented with\r\n     the exterior in the following view--taken from Dr. Knight's\r\n     _Life of Erasmus_; p. 124.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration]\r\n\r\n     I shall conclude this ERASMIANA (if the reader will premit\r\n     [Transcriber's Note: permit] me so to entitle it) with a\r\n     wood-cut exhibition of a different kind: it being perhaps\r\n     the earliest portrait of Erasmus published in this country.\r\n     It is taken from a work entitled, \"_The Maner and Forme of\r\n     Confesion_,\" printed by Byddell [Transcriber's Note:\r\n     Byddel], in 8vo., without date; and is placed immediately\r\n     under an address from Erasmus, to Moline, Bishop of Condome;\r\n     dated 1524; in which the former complains bitterly of \"the\r\n     pain and grief of the reins of his back.\" The print is taken\r\n     from a tracing of the original, made by me, from a neat copy\r\n     of Byddel's edition, in the collection of Roger Wilbraham,\r\n     Esq. I am free to confess that it falls a hundred degrees\r\n     short of Albert Durer's fine print of him, executed A.D.\r\n     1526.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: 1524]]\r\n\r\nLIS. Let me go and bring it here! While you talk thus, I long to feast\r\nmy eyes upon these grand books.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. You need not. Nor must I give to Erasmus a greater share of\r\nattention than is due to him. We have a large and varied field--or\r\nrather domain--yet to pass over. Wishing, therefore, Lorenzo speedily\r\nto purchase a small bronze figure of him, from the celebrated large\r\none at Rotterdam, and to place the same upon a copy of his first\r\nedition of the _Greek Testament_ printed _upon vellum_,[301] by way of\r\na pedestal--I pass on to the notice of other bibliomaniacs of this\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 301: In the library of York cathedral there is a\r\n     copy of the first edition of Erasmus's Greek and Latin\r\n     Testament, 1516, fol., struck off UPON VELLUM. This, I\r\n     believe, was never before generally known.]\r\n\r\nSubdued be every harsher feeling towards WOLSEY, when we contemplate\r\neven the imperfect remains of his literary institutions which yet\r\nsurvive! That this chancellor and cardinal had grand views, and a\r\nmagnificent taste, is unquestionable: and I suppose few libraries\r\ncontained more beautiful or more numerous copies of precious volumes\r\nthan his own. For, when in favour with his royal master, Henry VIII.,\r\nWolsey had, in all probability, such an ascendency over him as to coax\r\nfrom him almost every choice book which he had inherited from his\r\nfather, Henry VII.; and thus I should apprehend, although no\r\nparticular mention is made of his library in the inventories of his\r\ngoods[302] which have been published, there can be no question about\r\nsuch a character as that of Wolsey having numerous copies of the\r\nchoicest books, bound in velvet of all colours, embossed with gold or\r\nsilver, and studded even with precious stones! I conceive that his\r\nown _Prayer Book_ must have been gorgeous in the extreme! Unhappy\r\nman--a pregnant and ever-striking example of the fickleness of human\r\naffairs, and of the instability of human grandeur! When we think of\r\nthy baubles and trappings--of thy goblets of gold, and companies of\r\nretainers--and turn our thoughts to Shakspeare's shepherd, as\r\ndescribed in the soliloquy of one of our monarchs, we are fully\r\ndisposed to admit the force of such truths as have been familiar to us\r\nfrom boyhood, and which tell us that those shoulders feel the most\r\nburdened upon which the greatest load of responsibility rests. Peace\r\nto the once proud, and latterly repentant, spirit of Wolsey!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 302: In the last _Variorum edition of Shakspeare_,\r\n     1803, vol. xv., p. 144, we are referred by Mr. Douce to \"the\r\n     particulars of this inventory at large, in Stowe's\r\n     _Chronicle_, p. 546, edit. 1631:\" my copy of Stowe is of the\r\n     date of 1615; but, not a syllable is said of it in the place\r\n     here referred to, or at any other page; although the account\r\n     of Wolsey is ample and interesting. Mr. Douce (_ibid._) says\r\n     that, among the _Harl. MSS._ (no. 599) there is one\r\n     entitled \"An Inventorie of Cardinal Wolsey's rich householde\r\n     stuffe; temp. Hen. VIII.; the original book, as it seems,\r\n     kept by his own officers.\" In Mr. Gutch's _Collectanea\r\n     Curiosa_, vol. ii., 283-349, will be found a copious account\r\n     of Wolsey's plate:--too splendid, almost, for belief. To a\r\n     life and character so well known as are those of Wolsey, and\r\n     upon which Dr. Fiddes has published a huge folio of many\r\n     hundred pages, the reader will not here expect any\r\n     additional matter which may convey much novelty or interest.\r\n     The following, however, may be worth submitting to his\r\n     consideration. The Cardinal had poetical, as well as\r\n     political, enemies. Skelton and Roy, who did not fail to\r\n     gall him with their sharp lampoons, have shewn us, by their\r\n     compositions which have survived, that they were no\r\n     despicable assailants. In the former's \"_Why come ye not to\r\n     Court?_\" we have this caustic passage:\r\n\r\n          He is set so high\r\n          In his hierarchy\r\n          Of frantic _frenesy_\r\n          And foolish fantasy,\r\n          That in chamber of stars\r\n          All matters there he mars,\r\n          Clapping his rod on the _borde_\r\n          No man dare speake a word;\r\n          For he hath all the saying\r\n          Without any _renaying_:\r\n          He rolleth in his records\r\n          He saith: \"How say ye my lords?\r\n          Is not my reason good?\"\r\n          Good!--even good--Robin-hood?\r\n          Borne upon every side\r\n          _With pomp and with pride, &c._\r\n          To drink and for to eat\r\n          Sweet _ypocras_, and sweet meat,\r\n          To keep his flesh chaste\r\n          In Lent, for his repast\r\n          He eateth capons stew'd\r\n          Pheasant and partidge mewed.\r\n\r\n          WARTON'S _Hist. Engl. Poetry_, vol. ii., 345.\r\n\r\n     Steevens has also quoted freely from this poem of Skelton;\r\n     see the editions of _Shakspeare_, 1793, and 1803, in the\r\n     play of \"King Henry VIII.\" Skelton's satire against Wolsey\r\n     is noticed by our chronicler Hall: \"In this season, the\r\n     cardinal, by his power legantine, dissolved the convocation\r\n     at Paul's, called by the Archbishop of Canterbury; and\r\n     called him and all the clergy to his convocation to\r\n     Westminster, which was never seen before in England; whereof\r\n     Master Skelton, a merry poet, wrote:\r\n\r\n          Gentle Paul lay down thy _sweard_\r\n          For Peter of Westminster hath shaven thy beard.\"\r\n\r\n          _Chronicle_, p. 637, edit. 1809.\r\n\r\n     In Mr. G. Ellis's _Specimens of the Early English Poets_,\r\n     vol. ii., pp. 7, 8, there is a curious extract from the same\r\n     poet's \"_Image of Ypocrycye_\"--relating to Sir Thomas\r\n     More--which is printed for the first time from \"an\r\n     apparently accurate transcript\" of the original, in the\r\n     possession of Mr. Heber. From the last mentioned work (vol.\r\n     ii., p. 11, &c.), there is rather a copious account of a yet\r\n     more formidable poetical attack against Wolsey, in the\r\n     \"_Rede me and be not wroth_,\" of William Roy: a very rare\r\n     and precious little black-letter volume, which, although it\r\n     has been twice printed, is scarcely ever to be met with, and\r\n     was unknown to Warton. It will, however, make its appearance\r\n     in one of the supplemental volumes of Mr. Park's valuable\r\n     reprint of the _Harleian Miscellany_. While the cardinal was\r\n     thus attacked, in the biting strains of poetry, he was\r\n     doomed to experience a full share of reprobation in the\r\n     writings of the most popular theologians. William Tyndale\r\n     stepped forth to shew his zeal against papacy in his\r\n     \"_Practise of Popishe Prelates_,\" and from this work, as it\r\n     is incorporated in those of Tyndale, Barnes, and Frith,\r\n     printed by Day in 1572, fol., the reader is presented with\r\n     the following amusing specimen of the author's vein of\r\n     humour and indignation: \"And as I heard it spoken of divers,\r\n     he made, by craft of necromancy, graven imagery to bear upon\r\n     him; wherewith he bewitched the king's mind--and made the\r\n     king to doat upon him, more than he ever did on any lady or\r\n     gentlewoman: so that now the king's grace followed him, as\r\n     he before followed the king. And then what he said, that was\r\n     wisdom; what he praised, that was honourable only.\" Practise\r\n     of Popishe Prelates, p. 368. At p. 369, he calls him \"Porter\r\n     of Heaven.\" \"There he made a journey of gentlemen, arrayed\r\n     altogether in silks, so much as their very shoes and lining\r\n     of their boots; more like their mothers than men of war:\r\n     yea, I am sure that many of their mothers would have been\r\n     ashamed of so nice and wanton array. Howbeit, they went not\r\n     to make war, but peace, for ever and a day longer. But to\r\n     speak of the pompous apparel of my lord himself, and of his\r\n     chaplains, it passeth the xij Apostles. I dare swear that if\r\n     Peter and Paul had seen them suddenly, and at a blush, they\r\n     would have been harder in belief that they, or any such,\r\n     should be their successors than Thomas Didimus was to\r\n     believe that Christ was risen again from death.\" _Idem_, p.\r\n     370,--\"for the worship of his hat and glory of his precious\r\n     shoes--when he was pained with the cholic of an evil\r\n     conscience, having no other shift, because his soul could\r\n     find no other issue,--he took himself a medicine, _ut\r\n     emitteret spiritum per posteriora_.\" Exposition upon the\r\n     first Ep. of St. John, p. 404. Thomas Lupset, who was a\r\n     scholar of Dean Colet, and a sort of _elève_ of the\r\n     cardinal, (being appointed tutor to a bastard son of the\r\n     latter) could not suppress his sarcastical feelings in\r\n     respect of Wolsey's pomp and severity of discipline. From\r\n     Lupset's works, printed by Berthelet in 1546, 12mo., I\r\n     gather, in his address to his \"hearty beloved Edmond\"--that\r\n     \"though he had there with him plenty of books, yet the place\r\n     suffered him not to spend in them any study: for you shall\r\n     understand (says he) that I lie waiting on my LORD CARDINAL,\r\n     whose hours I must observe to be always at hand, lest I\r\n     should be called when I am not by: the which should be taken\r\n     for a fault of great negligence. Wherefore, that I am now\r\n     well satiated with the beholding of these gay hangings, that\r\n     garnish here every wall, I will turn me and talk with you.\"\r\n     (_Exhortacion to yonge men_, fol. 39, rev.) Dr. Wordsworth,\r\n     in the first volume of his _Ecclesiastical Biography_, has\r\n     printed, for the first time, the genuine text of Cavendish's\r\n     interesting life of his reverend master, Wolsey. It is well\r\n     worth perusal. But the reader, I fear, is beginning to be\r\n     outrageous (having kept his patience, during this\r\n     long-winded note, to the present moment) for some\r\n     _bibliomaniacal_ evidence of Wolsey's attachment to gorgeous\r\n     books. He is presented, therefore, with the following case\r\n     in point. My friend Mr. Ellis, of the British Museum,\r\n     informs me that, in the splendid library of that\r\n     establishment, there are two copies of Galen's \"_Methodus\r\n     Medendi_,\" edited by Linacre, and printed at Paris, in\r\n     folio, 1519. One copy, which belonged to Henry the Eighth,\r\n     has an illuminated title, with the royal arms at the bottom\r\n     of the title-page. The other, which is also illuminated, has\r\n     the cardinal's cap in the same place, above an empty shield.\r\n     Before the dedication to the king, in the latter copy,\r\n     Linacre has inserted an elegant Latin epistle to WOLSEY, in\r\n     manuscript. The king's copy is rather the more beautiful of\r\n     the two: but the _unique_ appendage of the Latin epistle\r\n     shews that the editor considered the cardinal a more\r\n     distinguished bibliomaniac than the monarch.]\r\n\r\nWe have now reached the REFORMATION; upon which, as Burnet, Collier,\r\nand Strype, have written huge folio volumes, it shall be my object to\r\nspeak sparingly: and chiefly as it concerns the history of the\r\nBibliomania. A word or two, however, about its origin, spirit, and\r\ntendency.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been at first very equivocal, with Henry the Eighth,\r\nwhether he would take any decisive measures in the affair, or not. He\r\nhesitated, resolved, and hesitated again.[303] The creature of caprice\r\nand tyranny, he had neither fixed principles, nor settled data, upon\r\nwhich to act. If he had listened to the temperate advice of CROMWELL\r\nor CRANMER,[304] he would have attained his darling object by less\r\ndecisive, but certainly by more justifiable, means. Those able and\r\nrespectable counsellors saw clearly that violent measures would\r\nproduce violent results; and that a question of law, of no mean\r\nmagnitude, was involved in the very outset of the transaction--for\r\nthere seemed, on the one side, no right to possess; and, on the other,\r\nno right to render possession.[305]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 303: \"The king seemed to think that his subjects\r\n     owed an entire resignation of their reasons and consciences\r\n     to him; and, as he was highly offended with those who still\r\n     adhered to the papal authority, so he could not bear the\r\n     haste that some were making to a further reformation, before\r\n     or beyond his allowance. So, in the end of the year 1538, he\r\n     set out a proclamation, in which he prohibits the importing\r\n     of all foreign books, or the printing of any at home without\r\n     license; and the printing of any parts of the scripture,\r\n     'till they were examined by the king and his council,\" &c.\r\n     \"He requires that none may argue against the presence of\r\n     Christ in the Sacrament, under the pain of death, and of the\r\n     loss of their goods; and orders all to be punished who did\r\n     disuse any rites or ceremonies not then abolished; yet he\r\n     orders them only to be observed without superstition, only\r\n     as remembrances, and not to repose in them a trust of\r\n     salvation.\"--Burnet's _Hist. of the Reformation_. But long\r\n     before this obscure and arbitrary act was passed, Henry's\r\n     mind had been a little shaken against papacy from a singular\r\n     work, published by one Fish, called \"_The Supplication of\r\n     Beggers_.\" Upon this book being read through in the presence\r\n     of Henry, the latter observed, shrewdly enough, \"If a man\r\n     should pull down an old stone wall, and begin at the lower\r\n     part, the upper part thereof might chance to fall upon his\r\n     head.\" \"And then he took the book, and put it into his desk,\r\n     and commanded them, upon their allegiance, that they should\r\n     not tell to any man that he had seen this book.\" Fox's _Book\r\n     of Martyrs_; vol. ii., p. 280: edit. 1641. Sir Thomas More\r\n     answered this work (which depicted, in frightful colours,\r\n     the rapacity of the Roman Catholic clergy), in 1529; see my\r\n     edition of the latter's _Utopia_; vol. i., xciii.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 304: \"These were some of the resolute steps King\r\n     Henry made towards the obtaining again this long struggled\r\n     for, and almost lost, right and prerogative of kings, in\r\n     their own dominions, of being supreme, against the\r\n     encroachments of the bishops of Rome. Secretary CROMWEL had\r\n     the great stroke in all this. All these counsels and methods\r\n     were struck out of his head.\" Strype's _Ecclesiastical\r\n     Memorials_; vol. i., p. 205. When great murmurs ensued, on\r\n     the suppression of the monasteries, because of the cessation\r\n     of hospitality exercised in them, \"CROMWELL advised the king\r\n     to sell their lands, at very easie rates, to the gentry in\r\n     the several counties, obliging them, since they had them\r\n     upon such terms, to keep up the wonted hospitality. This\r\n     drew in the gentry apace,\" &c. Burnet's _Hist. of the\r\n     Reformation_; vol. i., p. 223. \"ARCHBISHOP CRANMER is said\r\n     to have counselled and pressed the king to dissolve the\r\n     monasteries; but for other ends (than those of personal\r\n     enmity against 'the monks or friars'--or of enriching\r\n     himself 'with the spoils' of the same); viz. that, out of\r\n     the revenues of these monasteries, the king might found more\r\n     bishoprics; and that dioceses, being reduced into less\r\n     compass, the diocesans might the better discharge their\r\n     office, according to the scripture and primitive\r\n     rules.----And the archbishop hoped that, from these ruins,\r\n     there would be new foundations in every cathedral erected,\r\n     to be nurseries of learning for the use of the whole\r\n     diocese.\" Strype's _Life of Archbishop Cranmer_, p. 35.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 305: \"A very rational doubt yet remained, how\r\n     religious persons could alienate and transfer to the king a\r\n     property, of which they themselves were only tenants for\r\n     life: and an act of parliament was framed in order to remove\r\n     all future scruples on this head, and 'settle rapine and\r\n     sacrilege,' as Lord Herbert terms them, 'on the king and his\r\n     heirs for ever.'----It does not appear to have been debated,\r\n     in either house, whether they had a power to dispossess some\r\n     hundred thousand persons of their dwellings and fortunes,\r\n     whom, a few years before, they had declared to be good\r\n     subjects: if such as live well come under that\r\n     denomination.\"--\"Now,\" says Sir Edward Coke, \"observe the\r\n     conclusion of this tragedy. In that very parliament, when\r\n     the great and opulent priory of St. John of Jerusalem was\r\n     given to the king, and which was the last monastery seized\r\n     on, he demanded a fresh subsidy of the clergy and laity: he\r\n     did the same again within two years; and again three years\r\n     after; and since the dissolution exacted great loans, and\r\n     against law obtained them.\"--_Life of Reginald Pole_; vol.\r\n     i., p. 247-9: edit. 1767, 8vo. Coke's 4th _Institute_, fol.\r\n     44.]\r\n\r\nLATIMER, more hasty and enthusiastic than his episcopal brethren, set\r\nall the engines of his active mind to work, as if to carry the point\r\nby a _coup de main_; and although his resolution was, perhaps, upon\r\nmore than one occasion, shaken by the sufferings of the innocent,\r\nyet, by his example, and particularly by his sermons,[306] he tried\r\nto exasperate every Protestant bosom against the occupiers of\r\nmonasteries and convents.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 306: \"It was once moved by LATYMER, the good\r\n     bishop of Worcester, that two or three of these foundations\r\n     might be spared in each diocese, for the sake of\r\n     hospitality. Which gave the foresaid bishop occasion to move\r\n     the Lord Crumwell once in the behalf of the _Priory of\r\n     Malvern_.\" Strype's _Ecclesiastical Memorials_, vol. i.,\r\n     259. Latimer's letter is here printed; and an interesting\r\n     one it is. Speaking of the prior, he tells Cromwell that\r\n     \"The man is old, a good housekeeper, feedeth many; and that,\r\n     daily. For the country is poor, and full of penury.\" But the\r\n     hospitality and infirmities of this poor prior were less\r\n     likely to operate graciously upon the rapacious mind of\r\n     Henry than \"the 500 marks to the king, and 200 marks more to\r\n     the said Lord Crumwell,\" which he tendered at the same time.\r\n     See Strype, _ibid._ For the credit of Latimer, I hope this\r\n     worthy prior was not at the head of the priory when the\r\n     former preached before the king, and thus observed: \"To let\r\n     pass the _solempne_ and nocturnal bacchanals, the prescript\r\n     miracles, that are done upon certain days in the West part\r\n     of England, who hath not heard? I think ye have heard of\r\n     Saint _Blesis's_ heart, which is _at Malvern_, and of Saint\r\n     Algar's bones, how long they deluded the people!\" See\r\n     Latimer's _Sermons_: edit. 1562, 4to.: fol. 12, rect. In\r\n     these Sermons, as is justly said above, there are many\r\n     cutting philippics--especially against \"in-preaching\r\n     prelates;\" some of whom Latimer doth not scruple to call\r\n     \"minters--dancers--crouchers--pamperers of their paunches,\r\n     like a monk that maketh his jubilee--mounchers in their\r\n     mangers, and moilers in their gay manors and mansions:\" see\r\n     fol. 17, rect. Nevertheless, there are few productions which\r\n     give us so lively and interesting a picture of the manners\r\n     of the age as the SERMONS OF LATIMER; which were spoilt in\r\n     an \"_editio castrata_\" that appeared in the year 1788, 8vo.\r\n     But Latimer was not the only popular preacher who directed\r\n     his anathemas against the Roman Catholic clergy. The well\r\n     known JOHN FOX entered into the cause of the reformation\r\n     with a zeal and success of which those who have slightly\r\n     perused his compositions can have but a very inadequate\r\n     idea. The following curious (and I may add very interesting)\r\n     specimen of Fox's pulpit eloquence is taken from \"_A Sermon\r\n     of Christ crucified, preached at Paule's Crosse, the Friday\r\n     before Easter, commonly called Good Fridaie_:\"--\"Let me tell\r\n     you a story, which I remember was done about the beginning\r\n     of Queen Mary's reign, anno 1554. There was a certain\r\n     message sent, not from heaven, but from Rome: not from God,\r\n     but from the pope: not by any apostle, but by a certain\r\n     cardinal, who was called Cardinal Poole, Legatus a latere,\r\n     Legatus natus, a legate from the pope's own white side, sent\r\n     hither into England. This cardinal legate, first coming to\r\n     Dover, was honourably received and brought to Greenwich:\r\n     where he again, being more honourably received by lords of\r\n     high estate, and of the Privy Council (of whom some are yet\r\n     alive) was conducted thence to the privy stairs of the\r\n     queen's court at Westminster, no less person than King\r\n     Philip himself waiting upon him, and receiving him; and so\r\n     was brought to the queen's great chamber, she then being, or\r\n     else pretending, not to be well at ease. Stephen Gardiner,\r\n     the bishop of Winchester, and Lord Chancellor of England,\r\n     receiving this noble legate in the king and the queen's\r\n     behalf, to commend and set forth the authority of this\r\n     legate, the greatness of his message, and the supreme\r\n     majesty of the sender, before the public audience of the\r\n     whole parliament at that time assembled, there openly\r\n     protested, with great solemnity of words, what a mighty\r\n     message, and of what great importance was then brought into\r\n     the realm, even the greatest message (said he) that ever\r\n     came into England, and therefore desired them to give\r\n     attentive and inclinable ears to such a famous legation,\r\n     sent from so high authority.\" \"Well, and what message was\r\n     this? forsooth, that the realm of England should be\r\n     reconciled again unto their father the pope; that is to say,\r\n     that the queen, with all her nobility and sage council, with\r\n     so many learned prelates, discreet lawyers, worthy commons,\r\n     and the whole body of the realm of England, should captive\r\n     themselves, and become underlings to an Italian stranger,\r\n     and friarly priest, sitting in Rome, which never knew\r\n     England, never was here, never did, or shall do, England\r\n     good. And this forsooth (said Gardiner) was the greatest\r\n     ambassage, the weightiest legacy that ever came to England:\r\n     forgetting belike either this message of God, sent here by\r\n     his apostles unto vs, or else because he saw it made not so\r\n     much for his purpose as did the other, he made the less\r\n     account thereof.\" \"Well, then, and will we see what a\r\n     weighty message this was that Gardiner so exquisitely\r\n     commended? first, the sender is gone, the messenger is gone,\r\n     the queen is gone, and the message gone, and yet England\r\n     standeth not a rush the better. Of which message I thus say,\r\n     answering again to Gardiner, _per inversionem Rhetoricam_,\r\n     that, as he sayeth, it was the greatest--so I say again, it\r\n     was the lightest--legacy; the most ridiculous trifle, and\r\n     most miserablest message, of all other that ever came, or\r\n     ever shall come, to England, none excepted, for us to be\r\n     reconciled to an outlandish priest, and to submit our necks\r\n     under a foreign yoke. What have we to do more with him than\r\n     with the great Calypha of Damascus? If reconciliation ought\r\n     to follow, where offences have risen, the pope hath offended\r\n     us more than his coffers are able to make us amends. We\r\n     never offended him. But let the pope, with his\r\n     reconciliation and legates, go, as they are already gone\r\n     (God be thanked): and I beseech God so they may be gone,\r\n     that they never come here again. England never fared better\r\n     than when the pope did most curse it. And yet I hear\r\n     whispering of certain privy reconcilers, sent of late by the\r\n     pope, which secretly creep in corners. But this I leave to\r\n     them that have to do with all. Let us again return to our\r\n     matter.\"--_Imprinted by Jhon Daie_, &c., 1575, 8vo., sign.\r\n     A. vij.-B. i.]\r\n\r\nWith Henry, himself, the question of spiritual supremacy was soon\r\nchanged, or merged (as the lawyers call it) into the exclusive\r\nconsideration of adding to his wealth. The Visitors who had been\r\ndeputed to inspect the abbies, and to draw up reports of the same\r\n(some of whom, by the bye, conducted themselves with sufficient\r\nbaseness[307]), did not fail to inflame his feelings by the tempting\r\npictures which they drew of the riches appertaining to these\r\nestablishments.[308] Another topic was also strongly urged upon\r\nHenry's susceptible mind: the alleged abandoned lives of the owners of\r\nthem. These were painted with a no less overcharged pencil:[309] so\r\nthat nothing now seemed wanting but to set fire to the train of\r\ncombustion which had been thus systematically laid.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 307: Among the visitors appointed to carry into\r\n     execution the examination of the monasteries, was a Dr.\r\n     London; who \"was afterwards not only a persecutor of\r\n     Protestants, but a suborner of false witnesses against them,\r\n     and was now zealous even to officiousness in suppressing the\r\n     monasteries. He also studied to frighten the abbess of\r\n     Godstow into a resignation. She was particularly in\r\n     Cromwell's favour:\" &c. Burnet: _Hist. of the Reformation_,\r\n     vol. iii., p. 132. Among Burnet's \"Collection of Records,\"\r\n     is the letter of this said abbess, in which she tells\r\n     Cromwell that \"Doctor London was suddenly _cummyd_ unto her,\r\n     with a great rout with him; and there did threaten her and\r\n     her sisters, saying that he had the king's commission to\r\n     suppress the house, spite of her teeth. And when he saw that\r\n     she was content that he should do all things according to\r\n     his commission, and shewed him plain that she would never\r\n     surrender to his band, being her ancient enemy--then he\r\n     began to entreat her and to inveigle her sisters, one by\r\n     one, otherwise than ever she heard tell that any of the\r\n     king's subjects had been handel'd;\" vol. iii., p. 130.\r\n     \"Collection.\" It is not very improbable that this treatment\r\n     of Godstow nunnery formed a specimen of many similar\r\n     visitations. As to London himself, he ended his days in the\r\n     Fleet, after he had been adjudged to ride with his face to\r\n     the horse's tail, at Windsor and Oakingham. Fox in his _Book\r\n     of Martyrs_, has given us a print of this transaction;\r\n     sufficiently amusing. Dod, in his _Church History_, vol. i.,\r\n     p. 220, has of course not spared Dr. London. But see, in\r\n     particular, Fuller's shrewd remarks upon the character of\r\n     these visitors, or \"emissaries;\" _Church History_, b. vi.,\r\n     pp. 313, 314.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 308: \"The yearly revenue of all the abbies\r\n     suppressed is computed at £135,522_l._ 18_s._ 10_d._ Besides\r\n     this, the money raised out of the stock of cattle and corn,\r\n     out of the timber, lead, and bells; out of the furniture,\r\n     plate, and church ornaments, amounted to a vast sum, as may\r\n     be collected from what was brought off from the monastery of\r\n     St. Edmonsbury. Hence, as appears from records, 5000 marks\r\n     of gold and silver, besides several jewels of great value,\r\n     were seized by the visitors.\" Collier's _Ecclesiastical\r\n     History_, vol. ii., 165. See also Burnet's similar work,\r\n     vol. i., p. 223. Collier specifies the valuation of certain\r\n     monasteries, which were sufficiently wealthy; but he has not\r\n     noticed that of St. Swithin's in Winchester--of which Strype\r\n     has given so minute and interesting an inventory. A lover of\r\n     old coins and relics may feed his imagination with a\r\n     gorgeous picture of what might have been the \"massive silver\r\n     and golden crosses and shrines garnished with stones\"--but a\r\n     tender-hearted bibliomaniac will shed tears of agony on\r\n     thinking of the fate of \"A BOOK OF THE FOUR EVANGELISTS,\r\n     WRITTEN AL WITH GOLD; AND THE UTTER SIDE OF PLATE OF GOLD!\"\r\n     _Life of Cranmer_, _Appendix_, pp. 24-28.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 309: The amiable and candid Strype has polluted\r\n     the pages of his valuable _Ecclesiastical Memorials_ with an\r\n     account of such horrid practices, supposed to have been\r\n     carried on in monasteries, as must startle the most\r\n     credulous Anti-Papist; and which almost leads us to conclude\r\n     that _a legion of fiends_ must have been let loose upon\r\n     these \"Friar Rushes!\" The author tells us that he takes his\r\n     account from authentic documents--but these documents turn\r\n     out to be the letters of the visitors; and of the character\r\n     of one of these the reader has just had a sufficient proof.\r\n     Those who have the work here referred to, vol. i., p. 256-7,\r\n     may think, with the author of it, that \"this specimen is\r\n     enough and too much.\" What is a little to be marvelled at,\r\n     Strype suffers his prejudices against the conduct of the\r\n     monks to be heightened by a letter from one of the name of\r\n     Beerly, at Pershore; who, in order that he might escape the\r\n     general wreck, turned tail upon his brethren, and vilified\r\n     them as liberally as their professed enemies had done. Now,\r\n     to say the least, this was not obtaining what Chief Baron\r\n     Gilbert, in his famous Law of Evidence, has laid it down as\r\n     necessary to be obtained--\"the best possible evidence that\r\n     the nature of the case will admit of.\" It is worth remarking\r\n     that Fuller has incorporated a particular account of the\r\n     names of the abbots and of the carnal enormities of which\r\n     they are supposed to have been guilty; but he adds that he\r\n     took it from the 3d edition of Speed's _Hist. of Great\r\n     Britain_, and (what is worth special notice) that it was not\r\n     to be found in the prior ones: \"being a posthume addition\r\n     after the author's death, attested in the margine with the\r\n     authority of Henry Steven his _Apologie for Herodotus_, who\r\n     took the same out of an English book, containing the\r\n     _Vileness discovered at the Visitation of Monasteries_.\"\r\n     _Church History_, b. vi., pp. 316, 317.]\r\n\r\nA pause perhaps of one moment might have ensued. A consideration of\r\nwhat had been done, in these monasteries, for the preservation of the\r\nliterature of past ages, and for the cultivation of elegant and\r\npeaceful pursuits, might, like \"the still small voice\" of conscience,\r\nhave suspended, for a second, the final sentence of confiscation. The\r\nhospitality for which the owners of these places had been, and were\r\nthen, eminently distinguished; but more especially the yet higher\r\nconsideration of their property having been left with them only as a\r\nsacred pledge to be handed down, unimpaired, to their successors--these\r\nthings,[310] one would think, might have infused some little mercy\r\nand moderation into Henry's decrees!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 310: There are two points, concerning the\r\n     subversion of monasteries, upon which all sensible Roman\r\n     Catholics make a rest, and upon which they naturally indulge\r\n     a too well-founded grief. The dispersion of books or\r\n     interruption of study; and the breaking up of ancient\r\n     hospitality. Let us hear Collier upon the subject: \"The\r\n     advantages accruing to the public from these religious\r\n     houses were considerable, upon several accounts. To mention\r\n     some of them: The temporal nobility and gentry had a\r\n     creditable way of providing for their younger children.\r\n     Those who were disposed to withdraw from the world, or not\r\n     likely to make their fortunes in it, had a handsome retreat\r\n     to the cloister. Here they were furnished with conveniences\r\n     for life and study, with opportunities for thought and\r\n     recollection; and, over and above, passed their time in a\r\n     condition not unbecoming their quality.\"--\"The abbies were\r\n     very serviceable places for the education of young people:\r\n     every convent had one person or more assigned for this\r\n     business. Thus the children of the neighbourhood were taught\r\n     grammar and music without any charge to their parents. And,\r\n     in the nunneries, those of the other sex learned to work and\r\n     read English, with some advances into Latin,\" &c.--\"Farther,\r\n     it is to the abbies we are obliged for most of our\r\n     historians, both of church and state: these places of\r\n     retirement had both most learning and leisure for such\r\n     undertakings: neither did they want information for such\r\n     employment,\" _Ecclesiastical History_, vol. ii., 165. A host\r\n     of Protestant authors, with Lord Herbert at the head of\r\n     them, might be brought forward to corroborate these sensible\r\n     remarks of Collier. The hospitality of the monastic life has\r\n     been on all sides admitted; and, according to Lord Coke, one\r\n     of the articles of impeachment against Cardinal Wolsey was\r\n     that he had caused \"this hospitality and relief to grow into\r\n     decay and disuse;\" which was \"a great cause that there were\r\n     so many vagabonds, beggars, and thieves;\"--_Fourth\r\n     Institute_; p. 91, edit. 1669. So that the author of an\r\n     ancient, and now rarely perused work had just reason, in\r\n     describing the friars of his time as \"living in common upon\r\n     the goods of a monastery, either gotten by common labour, or\r\n     else upon lands and possessions where with the monastery was\r\n     endowed.\" _Pype or Tonne of the Lyfe of Perfection_; fol.\r\n     clxxii., rev. 1532, 4to. And yet, should the active\r\n     bibliomaniac be disposed to peruse this work, after\r\n     purchasing Mr. Triphook's elegant copy of the same, he might\r\n     probably not think very highly of the author's good sense,\r\n     when he found him gravely telling us that \"the appetite of\r\n     clean, sweet, and fair, or fine cloaths, and oft-washing and\r\n     curious _pykyng_ of the body, is an enemy of chastity,\" fol.\r\n     ccxxix. rect. The DEVASTATION OF BOOKS was, I fear,\r\n     sufficiently frightful to warrant the following writers in\r\n     their respective conclusions. \"A judicious author (says\r\n     Ashmole) speaking of the dissolution of our monasteries,\r\n     saith thus: Many manuscripts, guilty of no other\r\n     superstition then (having) _red letters_ in the front, were\r\n     condemned to the fire: and here a principal key of antiquity\r\n     was lost, to the great prejudice of posterity. Indeed (such\r\n     was learning's misfortune, at that great devastation of our\r\n     English libraries, that) where a _red letter_ or a\r\n     mathematical diagram appeared, they were sufficient to\r\n     entitle the book to be popish or diabolical.\" _Theatrum\r\n     Chemicum_; prolegom. A. 2. rev. \"The avarice of the late\r\n     intruders was so mean, and their ignorance so\r\n     undistinguishing, that, when the books happened to have\r\n     COSTLY COVERS, they tore them off, and threw away the works,\r\n     or turned them to the vilest purposes.\" _Life of Reginald\r\n     Pole_; vol. i., p. 253-4, edit. 1767, 8vo. The author of\r\n     this last quotation then slightly notices what Bale has said\r\n     upon these book-devastations; and which I here subjoin at\r\n     full length; from my first edition of this work:--\"Never\r\n     (says Bale) had we been offended for the loss of our\r\n     LIBRARIES, being so many in number, and in so desolate\r\n     places for the more part, if the chief monuments and most\r\n     notable works of our excellent writers had been preserved.\r\n     If there had been, in every shire of England, but one\r\n     SOLEMPNE LIBRARY, to the preservation of those noble works,\r\n     and preferment of good learning in our posterity, it had\r\n     been yet somewhat. But to destroy all, without\r\n     consideration, is, and will be, unto England, for ever, a\r\n     most horrible infamy among the grave seniors of other\r\n     nations. A great number of them, which purchased those\r\n     superstitious mansions, reserved of those library-books some\r\n     to serve the _jakes_, some to scour their candlesticks, and\r\n     some to rub their boots: some they sold to the grocers and\r\n     soap sellers; some they sent over sea to the book-binders,\r\n     not in small number, but at times whole ships full, to the\r\n     wondering of the foreign nations. Yea, the Universities of\r\n     the realm are not all clear of this detestable fact. But\r\n     cursed is that belly which seeketh to be fed with such\r\n     ungodly gains, and shameth his natural country. I know a\r\n     merchant man, which shall at this time be nameless, that\r\n     _bought the contents of two noble libraries for forty\r\n     shillings price_; a shame it is to be spoken! This stuff\r\n     hath he occupied in the stead of grey paper, by the space of\r\n     more than ten years, and yet he hath store enough for as\r\n     many years to come!\" Preface to _Leland's Laboryouse\r\n     Journey_, &c., 1549, 8vo. Reprint of 1772; sign. C.]\r\n\r\nPHIL. But what can be said in defence of the dissolute lives of the\r\nmonks?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Dissoluteness shall never be defended by me, let it be shewn\r\nby whom it may; and therefore I will not take the part, on this head,\r\nof the tenants of old monasteries. But, Philemon, consider with what\r\ngrace could this charge come from HIM who had \"shed innocent blood,\"\r\nto gratify his horrid lusts?\r\n\r\nLIS. Yet, tell me, did not the dissolution of these libraries in some\r\nrespects equally answer the ends of literature, by causing the books\r\nto come into other hands?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. No doubt, a few studious men reaped the benefit of this\r\ndispersion, by getting possession of many curious volumes with which,\r\notherwise, they might never have been acquainted. If my memory be not\r\ntreacherous, the celebrated grammarian ROBERT WAKEFIELD[311] was\r\nsingularly lucky in this way. It is time, however, to check my\r\nrambling ideas. A few more words only, and we cease to sermonize upon\r\nthe Reformation.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 311: \"This ROBERT WAKEFIELD was the prime linguist\r\n     of his time, having obtained beyond the seas the Greek,\r\n     Hebrew, Chaldaic, and Syriac tongues. In one thing he is to\r\n     be commended, and that is this, that he carefully preserved\r\n     divers books of Greek and Hebrew at the dissolution of\r\n     religious houses, and especially some of those in the\r\n     library of Ramsey abbey, composed by Laurence Holbecke, monk\r\n     of that place, in the reign of Henry IV. He died at London\r\n     8th October, 1537, leaving behind him the name of _Polypus_,\r\n     as Leland is pleased to style him, noting that he was of a\r\n     witty and crafty behaviour.\" Wood's _Hist. of Colleges and\r\n     Halls_, p. 429, Gutch's edit.]\r\n\r\nPHIL. There is no occasion to be extremely laconic. The evening has\r\nhardly yet given way to night. The horizon, I dare say, yet faintly\r\nglows with the setting-sun-beams. But proceed as you will.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. The commotions which ensued from the arbitrary measures of\r\nHenry were great;[312] but such as were naturally to be expected. At\r\nlength Henry died, and a young and amiable prince reigned for a few\r\nmonths. Mary next ascended the throne; and the storm took an opposite\r\ndirection. Then an attempt was made to restore chalices, crucifixes,\r\nand missals. But the short period of her sovereignty making way for\r\nthe long and illustrious one of her sister Elizabeth, the Cecils and\r\nWalsinghams[313] united their great talents with the equally vigorous\r\nones of the Queen and her favourite archbishop Parker, in establishing\r\nthat form of religion which, by partaking in a reasonable degree of\r\nthe solemnity of the Romish church, and by being tempered with great\r\nsimplicity and piety in its prayers, won its way to the hearts of the\r\ngenerality of the people. Our _Great English Bibles_[314] were now\r\nrestored to their conspicuous situations; and the Bibliomania, in\r\nconsequence, began to spread more widely and effectively.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 312: Fuller has devoted one sentence only, and\r\n     that not written with his usual force, to the havoc and\r\n     consternation which ensued on the devastation of the\r\n     monasteries. _Ch.

Burnet is a little\r\n     more moving: _Hist. of the Reformation_; vol. i., p. 223.\r\n     But, from the foregoing premises, the reader may probably be\r\n     disposed to admit the conclusion of a virulent Roman\r\n     Catholic writer, even in its fullest extent: namely, that\r\n     there were \"subverted monasteries, overthrown abbies, broken\r\n     churches, torn castles, rent towers, overturned walls of\r\n     towns and fortresses, with the confused heaps of all ruined\r\n     monuments.\" _Treatise of Treasons_, 1572, 8vo., fol. 148,\r\n     rev.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 313: There are few bibliographers at all versed in\r\n     English literature and history, who have not heard, by some\r\n     side wind or other, of the last mentioned work; concerning\r\n     which Herbert is somewhat interesting in his notes:\r\n     _Typographical Antiquities_, vol. iii., p. 1630. The reader\r\n     is here presented with a copious extract from this curious\r\n     and scarce book--not for the sake of adding to these\r\n     ponderous notes relating to the REFORMATION--(a subject,\r\n     upon which, from a professional feeling, I thought it my\r\n     duty to say something!)--but for the sake of showing how\r\n     dexterously the most important events and palpable truths\r\n     may be described and perverted by an artful and headstrong\r\n     disputant. The work was written expressly to defame\r\n     ELIZABETH, CECIL, and BACON, and to introduce the Romish\r\n     religion upon the ruins of the Protestant. The author thus\r\n     gravely talks\r\n\r\n     \"_Of Queen Mary and her Predecessors._\r\n\r\n     \"She (Mary) found also the whole face of the commonwealth\r\n     settled and acquieted in the ancient religion; in which, and\r\n     by which, all kings and queens of that realm (from as long\r\n     almost before the conquest as that conquest was before that\r\n     time) had lived, reigned, and maintained their states; and\r\n     the terrible correction of those few that swerved from it\r\n     notorious, as no man could be ignorant of it. As King John,\r\n     without error in religion, for contempt only of the See\r\n     Apostolic, plagued with the loss of his state, till he\r\n     reconciled himself, and acknowledged to hold his crown of\r\n     the Pope. King Henry VIII., likewise, with finding no end of\r\n     heading and hanging, till (with the note of tyranny for\r\n     wasting his nobility) he had headed him also that procured\r\n     him to it.

He wrote a comical poetical satire against the Romish priests,\r\nunder the title of \"_A Plaister for a galled Horse_,\"[317] which\r\nRaynald printed in a little thin quarto volume of six or seven pages.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 317: In Herbert's _Typographical Antiquities_,\r\n     vol. i., p. 581, will be found rather a slight notice of\r\n     this raw and vulgar satire.

A\r\n     poetical satire of a similar kind, entitled \"_John Bon and\r\n     Mast Person_,\" was printed by Daye and Seres; who struck off\r\n     but a few copies, but who were brought into considerable\r\n     trouble for the same. The virulence with which the author\r\n     and printer of this lampoon were persecuted in Mary's reign\r\n     is sufficiently attested by the care which was taken to\r\n     suppress every copy that could be secured. The only perfect\r\n     known copy of this rare tract was purchased at the sale of\r\n     Mr. R.

I will make a memorandum to try to secure this \"comical\" piece,\r\nas you call it; but has it never been reprinted in our \"_Corpora\r\nPoetarum Anglicorum_?\"\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Never to the best of my recollection. Mr. Alexander Chalmers\r\nprobably shewed his judgment in the omission of it, in his lately\r\npublished collection of our poets.

And so, wishing every lover of his country's\r\nliterature to purchase a copy of the poems of both these heroes,[319]\r\nI march onward to introduce a new friend to you, who preceded Leland\r\nin his career, and for an account of whom we are chiefly indebted to\r\nthe excellent and best editor of the works of Spencer and Milton.\r\nDid'st ever hear, Lisardo, of one WILLIAM THYNNE?\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 318: About the year 1519, Hall mentions the Earl\r\n     of Surrey \"on a great coursir richely trapped, and a greate\r\n     whistle of gold set with stones and perle, hanging at a\r\n     great and massy chayne baudrick-wise.\" Chronicles: p. 65, a.\r\n     See Warton's _Life of Sir Thomas Pope_: p. 166, note o., ed.\r\n     1780.

Pray make me acquainted with him.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. You will love him exceedingly when you thoroughly know him;\r\nbecause he was the first man in this country who took pains to do\r\njustice to Chaucer, by collecting and collating the mutilated editions\r\nof his works. Moreover, he rummaged a great number of libraries, under\r\nthe express order of Henry VIII.; and seems in every respect (if we\r\nmay credit the apparently frank testimony of his son[320]), to have\r\nbeen a thoroughbred bibliomaniac. Secure Mr. Todd's _Illustrations of\r\nGower and Chaucer_, and set your heart at ease upon the subject.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 320: \"--but (my father, WILLIAM THYNNE) further\r\n     had commissione to serche all the libraries of England for\r\n     Chaucer's works, so that oute of all the abbies of this\r\n     realme (which reserved any monuments thereof), he was fully\r\n     furnished with multitude of bookes,\" &c.

Let us not hesitate one moment about the\r\n     appellation of _Helluo Librorum_,--justly due to MASTER\r\n     WILLIAM THYNNE!]\r\n\r\nBut it is time to introduce your favourite LELAND: a bibliomaniac of\r\nunparalleled powers and unperishable fame. To entwine the wreath of\r\npraise round the brow of this great man seems to have been considered\r\nby Bale among the most exquisite gratifications of his existence. It\r\nis with no small delight, therefore, Lorenzo, that I view, at this\r\ndistance, the marble bust of Leland in yonder niche of your library,\r\nwith a laureate crown upon its pedestal. And with almost equal\r\nsatisfaction did I observe, yesterday, during the absence of Philemon\r\nand Lisardo at the book-sale, the handsome manner in which\r\nHarrison,[321] in his _Description of England_, prefixed to\r\nHolinshed's Chronicles, has spoken of this illustrious antiquary. No\r\ndelays, no difficulties, no perils, ever daunted his personal\r\ncourage, or depressed his mental energies. Enamoured of study, to the\r\nlast rational moment of his existence, Leland seems to have been born\r\nfor the \"Laborious Journey\" which he undertook in search of truth, as\r\nshe was to be discovered among mouldering records, and worm-eaten\r\nvolumes. Uniting the active talents of a statist with the painful\r\nresearch of an antiquary, he thought nothing too insignificant for\r\nobservation. The confined streamlet or the capacious river--the\r\nobscure village or the populous town--were, with parchment rolls and\r\noaken-covered books, alike objects of curiosity in his philosophic\r\neye! Peace to his once vexed spirit!--and never-fading honours attend\r\nthe academical society in which his youthful mind was disciplined to\r\nsuch laudable pursuits!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 321: \"One helpe, and none of the smallest, that I\r\n     obtained herein, was by such commentaries as LELAND had\r\n     sometime collected of the state of Britaine; books vtterlie\r\n     mangled, defaced with wet and weather, and finallie\r\n     vnperfect through want of sundrie volumes.\" _Epistle\r\n     Dedicatorie_; vol. i., p. vi., edit. 1807. The history of\r\n     this great man, and of his literary labours, is most\r\n     interesting. He was a pupil of William Lilly, the first\r\n     head-master of St. Paul's school; and, by the kindness and\r\n     liberality of a Mr. Myles, he afterwards received the\r\n     advantage of a college education, and was supplied with\r\n     money in order to travel abroad, and make such collections\r\n     as he should deem necessary for the great work which even\r\n     then seemed to dawn upon his young and ardent mind. Leland\r\n     endeavoured to requite the kindness of his benefactor by an\r\n     elegant copy of Latin verses, in which he warmly expatiates\r\n     on the generosity of his patron, and acknowledges that his\r\n     acquaintance with the _Almæ Matres_ (for he was of both\r\n     Universities) was entirely the result of such beneficence.\r\n     While he resided on the continent, he was admitted into the\r\n     society of the most eminent Greek and Latin scholars, and\r\n     could probably number among his correspondents the\r\n     illustrious names of Budæus, Erasmus, the Stephenses, Faber\r\n     and Turnebus. Here, too, he cultivated his natural taste for\r\n     poetry; and, from inspecting the FINE BOOKS which the\r\n     Italian and French presses had produced, as well as fired by\r\n     the love of Grecian learning, which had fled, on the sacking\r\n     of Constantinople, to take shelter in the academic bowers of\r\n     the Medici--he seems to have matured his plans for carrying\r\n     into effect the great work which had now taken full\r\n     possession of his mind. He returned to England, resolved to\r\n     institute an inquiry into the state of the LIBRARIES,\r\n     ANTIQUITIES, RECORDS, and WRITINGS then in existence. Having\r\n     entered into holy orders, and obtained preferment at the\r\n     express interposition of the king (Henry VIII.), he was\r\n     appointed his antiquary and library-keeper; and a royal\r\n     commission was issued, in which Leland was directed to\r\n     search after \"ENGLAND'S ANTIQUITIES, and peruse the\r\n     libraries of all cathedrals, abbies, priories, colleges,\r\n     &c., as also all the places wherein records, writings, and\r\n     secrets of antiquity were reposited.\" \"Before Leland's\r\n     time,\" says Hearne--in a strain which makes one\r\n     shudder--\"all the literary monuments of antiquity were\r\n     totally disregarded; and students of Germany, apprized of\r\n     this culpable indifference, were suffered to enter our\r\n     libraries unmolested, and to cut out of the books, deposited\r\n     there, whatever passages they thought proper--which they\r\n     afterwards published as relics of the ancient literature of\r\n     their own country.\" _Pref. to the Itinerary._ Leland was\r\n     occupied, without intermission, in his laborious\r\n     undertaking, for the space of six years; and, on its\r\n     completion, he hastened to the metropolis to lay at the feet\r\n     of his sovereign the result of his researches. As John Kay\r\n     had presented his translation of the _Siege of Rhodes_ to\r\n     Edward IV., as \"A GIFT of his labour,\" so Leland presented\r\n     his Itinerary to Henry VIII., under the title of _A New\r\n     Year's Gift_; and it was first published as such by Bale in\r\n     1549, 8vo. \"Being inflamed,\" says the author, \"with a love\r\n     to see thoroughly all those parts of your opulent and ample\r\n     realm, in so much that all my other occupations intermitted,\r\n     I have so travelled in your dominions both by the sea coasts\r\n     and the middle parts, sparing neither labour nor costs, by\r\n     the space of six years past, that there is neither cape nor\r\n     bay, haven, creek, or pier, river, or confluence of rivers,\r\n     breaches, wastes, lakes, moors, fenny waters, mountains,\r\n     valleys, heaths, forests, chases, woods, cities, burghes,\r\n     castles, principal manor places, monasteries, and colleges,\r\n     but I have seen them; and noted, in so doing, a whole world\r\n     of things very memorable.\" Leland moreover tells his\r\n     majesty--that \"By his laborious journey and costly\r\n     enterprise, he had conserved many good authors, the which\r\n     otherwise had been like to have perished; of the which part\r\n     remained in the royal palaces, part also in his own\r\n     custody,\" &c. As Leland was engaged six years in this\r\n     literary tour, so he was occupied for a no less period of\r\n     time in digesting and arranging the prodigious number of\r\n     MSS. which he had collected. But he sunk beneath the\r\n     immensity of the task. The want of amanuenses, and of other\r\n     attentions and comforts, seems to have deeply affected him.\r\n     In this melancholy state, he wrote to Archbishop Cranmer a\r\n     Latin epistle, in verse, of which the following is the\r\n     commencement--very forcibly describing his situation and\r\n     anguish of mind:\r\n\r\n          Est congesta mihi domi supellex\r\n          Ingens, aurea, nobilis, venusta,\r\n          Qua totus studeo Britanniarum\r\n          Vero reddere gloriam nitori;\r\n          Sed fortuna meis noverca coeptis\r\n          Jam felicibus invidet maligna.\r\n\r\n          Quare, ne pereant brevi vel hora\r\n          Multarum mihi noctium labores\r\n          Omnes----\r\n          CRANMERE, eximium decus priorum!\r\n          Implorare tuam benignitatem\r\n          Cogor.\r\n\r\n     The result was that Leland lost his senses; and, after\r\n     lingering two years in a state of total derangement, he died\r\n     on the 18th of April, 1552. \"Prôh tristes rerum humanarum\r\n     vices! prôh viri optimi deplorandam infelicissimamque\r\n     sortem!\" exclaims Dr. Smith, in his preface to Camden's\r\n     Life, 1691, 4to. The precious and voluminous MSS. of Leland\r\n     were doomed to suffer a fate scarcely less pitiable that\r\n     [Transcriber's Note: than] that of their owner. After being\r\n     pilfered by some, and garbled by others, they served to\r\n     replenish the pages of Stow, Lambard, Camden, Burton,\r\n     Dugdale, and many other antiquaries and historians.\r\n     \"Leland's Remains,\" says Bagford, \"have been ever since a\r\n     standard to all that have any way treated of the Antiquities\r\n     of England. Reginald Wolfe intended to have made use of\r\n     them, although this was not done 'till after his death by\r\n     Harrison, Holinshed, and others concerned in that work.\r\n     Harrison transcribed his Itinerary, giving a Description of\r\n     England by the rivers, but he did not understand it. They\r\n     have likewise been made use of by several in part, but how\r\n     much more complete had this been, had it been finished by\r\n     himself?\" _Collectanea_: Hearne's edit., 1774; vol. i., p.\r\n     LXXVII. Polydore Virgil, who had stolen from these Remains\r\n     pretty freely, had the insolence to abuse Leland's\r\n     memory--calling him \"a vain-glorious man;\" but what shall we\r\n     say to this flippant egotist? who according to Caius's\r\n     testimony (_De Antiq. Cantab. Acad._, lib. 1.) \"to prevent a\r\n     discovery of the many errors of his own History of England,\r\n     collected and burnt a greater number of ancient histories\r\n     and manuscripts than would have loaded a waggon.\" There are\r\n     some (among whom I could number a most respectable friend\r\n     and well qualified judge) who have doubted of the propriety\r\n     of thus severely censuring Polydore Virgil; and who are even\r\n     sceptical about his malpractices. But Sir Henry Savile, who\r\n     was sufficiently contemporaneous to collect the best\r\n     evidence upon the subject, thus boldly observes: \"Nam\r\n     Polydorus, ut homo Italus, et in rebus nostris hospes, et\r\n     (quod caput est) neque in republica versatus, nec magni\r\n     alioqui vel judicii vel ingenii, pauca ex multis delibans,\r\n     et falsa plerumque pro veris amplexus, historiam nobis\r\n     reliquit cum cætera mendosam tum exiliter sanè et jejunè\r\n     conscriptam.\" _Script. post. Bedam._, edit. 1596; pref. \"As\r\n     for Polydore Virgil, he hath written either nothing or very\r\n     little concerning them; and that so little, so false and\r\n     misbeseeming the ingenuitie of an historian, that he seemeth\r\n     to have aimed at no other end than, by bitter invectives\r\n     against Henry VIII., and Cardinal Wolsey, to demerit the\r\n     favour of Queen Mary,\" &c., Godwyn's translation of the\r\n     _Annales of England_; edit. 1630, author's Preface. \"It is\r\n     also remarkable that Polydore Virgil's and Bishop Joscelin's\r\n     edition of Gildas's epistle differ so materially that the\r\n     author of it hardly seems to be one and the same person.\"\r\n     This is Gale's opinion: _Rer. Anglican. Script. Vet._; vol.\r\n     i., pref., p. 4. Upon the whole--to return to Leland--it\r\n     must be acknowledged that he is a melancholy, as well as\r\n     illustrious, example of the influence of the BIBLIOMANIA!\r\n     But do not let us take leave of him without a due\r\n     contemplation of his expressive features, as they are given\r\n     in the frontispiece of the first volume of the Lives of\r\n     Leland, Hearne, and Wood. 1772, 8vo.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: IN REFECTORIO COLL. OMN. ANIM. OXON.]]\r\n\r\nBALE follows closely after Leland. This once celebrated, and yet\r\nrespectable, writer had probably more zeal than discretion; but his\r\nexertions in the cause of our own church can never be mentioned\r\nwithout admiration. I would not, assuredly, quote Bale as a decisive\r\nauthority in doubtful or difficult cases;[322] but, as he lived in\r\nthe times of which he in a great measure wrote, and as his society was\r\ncourted by the wealthy and powerful, I am not sure whether he merits\r\nto be treated with the roughness with which some authors mention his\r\nlabours. He had, certainly, a tolerable degree of strength in his\r\nEnglish style; but he painted with a pencil which reminded us more\r\nfrequently of the horrific pictures of Spagnoletti than of the tender\r\ncompositions of Albano. That he idolized his master, Leland, so\r\nenthusiastically, will always cover, in my estimation, a multitude of\r\nhis errors: and that he should leave a scholar's inventory (as Fuller\r\nsaps [Transcriber's Note: says]), \"more books than money behind him,\"\r\nwill at least cause him to be numbered among the most renowned\r\nbibliomaniacs.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 322: Like all men, who desert a religion which\r\n     they once enthusiastically profess, Bale, after being\r\n     zealous for the papal superstitions, holding up his hands to\r\n     rotten posts, and calling them his \"fathers in heaven,\"\r\n     (according to his own confession) became a zealous\r\n     Protestant, and abused the church of Rome with a virulence\r\n     almost unknown in the writings of his predecessors. But in\r\n     spite of his coarseness, positiveness, and severity, he\r\n     merits the great praise of having done much in behalf of the\r\n     cause of literature. His attachment to Leland is,\r\n     unquestionably, highly to his honour; but his biographies,\r\n     especially of the Romish prelates, are as monstrously\r\n     extravagant as his plays are incorrigibly dull. He had a\r\n     certain rough honesty and prompt benevolence of character,\r\n     which may be thought to compensate for his grosser failings.\r\n     His reputation as a _bibliomaniac_ is fully recorded in the\r\n     anecdote mentioned at p. 234, ante. His \"magnum opus,\" the\r\n     _Scriptores Britanniæ_, has already been noticed with\r\n     sufficient minuteness; vide p. 31, ante. It has not escaped\r\n     severe animadversion. Francis Thynne tells us that Bale has\r\n     \"mistaken infynyte thinges in that booke de Scriptoribus\r\n     Anglie, being for the most part the collections of Lelande.\"\r\n     _Illustrations of Gower and Chaucer_; p. 23. Picard, in his\r\n     wretched edition of _Gulielmus Neubrigensis_ (edit. 1610, p.\r\n     672), has brought a severe accusation against the author of\r\n     having \"burnt or torn all the copies of the works which he\r\n     described, after he had taken the titles of them;\" but see\r\n     this charge successfully rebutted in Dr. Pegge's\r\n     _Anonymiana_; p. 311. That Bale's library, especially in the\r\n     department of manuscripts, was both rich and curious, is\r\n     indisputable, from the following passage in _Strype's Life\r\n     of Archbishop Parker_. \"The archbishop laid out for BALE'S\r\n     rare collection of MSS. immediately upon his death, fearing\r\n     that they might be gotten by somebody else. Therefore he\r\n     took care to bespeak them before others, and was promised to\r\n     have them for his money, as he told Cecil. And perhaps\r\n     divers of those books that do now make proud the University\r\n     Library, and that of Benet and some other colleges, in\r\n     Cambridge, were Bale's,\" p. 539. It would seem, from the\r\n     same authority, that our bibliomaniac \"set himself to search\r\n     the libraries in Oxford, Cambridge, London (wherein there\r\n     was but one, and that a slender one), Norwich, and several\r\n     others in Norfolk and Suffolk: whence he had collected\r\n     enough for another volume De Scriptoribus Britannicis.\"\r\n     _Ibid._ The following very beautiful wood-cut of Bale's\r\n     portrait is taken from the original, of the same size, in\r\n     the _Acta Romanorum Pontificum_; Basil, 1527, 8vo. A similar\r\n     one, on a larger scale, will be found in the \"_Scriptores_,\"\r\n     &c., published at Basil, 1557, or 1559--folio. Mr. Price,\r\n     the principal librarian of the Bodleian Library, shewed me a\r\n     rare head of Bale, of a very different cast of features--in\r\n     a small black-letter book, of which I have forgotten the\r\n     name.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration]]\r\n\r\nBefore I enter upon the reign of Elizabeth, let me pay a passing, but\r\nsincere, tribute of respect to the memory of CRANMER; whose _Great\r\nBible_[323] is at once a monument of his attachment to the Protestant\r\nreligion, and to splendid books. His end was sufficiently lamentable;\r\nbut while the flames were consuming his parched body, and while his\r\nright hand, extended in the midst of them, was reproached by him for\r\nits former act of wavering and \"offence,\" he had the comfort of\r\nsoothing his troubled spirit by reflecting upon what his past life had\r\nexhibited in the cause of learning, morality, and religion.[324] Let\r\nhis memory be respected among virtuous bibliomaniacs!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 323: I have perused what Strype (_Life of\r\n     Cranmer_, pp. 59, 63, 444), Lewis (_History of English\r\n     Bibles_, pp. 122-137), Johnson (_Idem opus_, pp. 33-42), and\r\n     Herbert (_Typog. Antiquities_, vol. i., p. 513,) have\r\n     written concerning the biblical labours of Archbishop\r\n     Cranmer; but the accurate conclusion to be drawn about the\r\n     publication which goes under the name of CRANMER'S, or THE\r\n     GREAT BIBLE, [Transcriber's Note: 'is' missing in original]\r\n     not quite so clear as bibliographers may imagine. However,\r\n     this is not the place to canvass so intricate a subject. It\r\n     is sufficient that a magnificent impression of the Bible in\r\n     the English language, with a superb frontispiece (which has\r\n     been most feebly and inadequately copied for Lewis's work),\r\n     under the archiepiscopal patronage of CRANMER, did make its\r\n     appearance in 1539: and it has been my good fortune to turn\r\n     over the leaves of the identical copy of it, printed UPON\r\n     VELLUM, concerning which Thomas Baker expatiates so\r\n     eloquently to his bibliomaniacal friend, Hearne. _Rob. of\r\n     Gloucester's Chronicle_; vol. i., p. xix. This copy is in\r\n     the library of St. John's College, Cambridge; and is now\r\n     placed upon a table, to the right hand, upon entering of the\r\n     same: although formerly, according to Bagford's account, it\r\n     was \"among some old books in a private place nigh the\r\n     library.\" _Idem_; p. xxii. There is a similar copy in the\r\n     British Museum.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 324: \"And thus\"--says Strype--(in a strain of\r\n     pathos and eloquence not usually to be found in his\r\n     writings) \"we have brought this excellent prelate unto his\r\n     end, after two years and a half hard imprisonment. His body\r\n     was not carried to the grave in state, nor buried, as many\r\n     of his predecessors were, in his own cathedral church, nor\r\n     inclosed in a monument of marble or touchstone. Nor had he\r\n     any inscription to set forth his praises to posterity. No\r\n     shrine to be visited by devout pilgrims, as his\r\n     predecessors, S. Dunstan and S. Thomas had.

For as an harp or lute, if it give no\r\n     certain sound that men may know what is stricken, who can\r\n     dance after it--for all the sound is vain; so is it vain and\r\n     profiteth nothing, sayeth Almighty God, by the mouth of St.\r\n     Paul, if the priest speak to the people in a language which\r\n     they know not.\" _Certain most godly, fruitful, and\r\n     comfortable letters of Saintes and holy Martyrs, &c._, 1564;\r\n     4to., fol. 8.]\r\n\r\nAll hail to the sovereign who, bred up in severe habits of reading and\r\nmeditation, loved books and scholars to the very bottom of her heart!\r\nI consider ELIZABETH as a royal bibliomaniac of transcendent fame!--I\r\nsee her, in imagination, wearing her favourite little _Volume of\r\nPrayers_,[325] the composition of Queen Catherine Parr, and Lady\r\nTirwit, \"bound in solid gold, and hanging by a gold chain at her\r\nside,\" at her morning and evening devotions--afterwards, as she became\r\nfirmly seated upon her throne, taking an interest in the\r\nembellishments of the _Prayer Book_,[326] which goes under her own\r\nname; and then indulging her strong bibliomaniacal appetites in\r\nfostering the institution \"for the erecting of _a Library and an\r\nAcademy for the study of Antiquities and History_.\"[327]\r\nNotwithstanding her earnestness to root out all relics of the Roman\r\nCatholic religion (to which, as the best excuse, we must, perhaps,\r\nattribute the sad cruelty of the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots), I\r\ncannot in my heart forbear to think but that she secured, for her own\r\nbook-boudoir, one or two of the curious articles which the\r\ncommissioners often-times found in the libraries that they inspected:\r\nand, amongst other volumes, how she could forbear pouncing upon \"_A\r\ngreat Pricksong Book of parchment_\"--discovered in the library of All\r\nSoul's College[328]--is absolutely beyond my wit to divine!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 325: Of this curious little devotional volume the\r\n     reader has already had some account (p. 119, ante); but if\r\n     he wishes to enlarge his knowledge of the same, let him\r\n     refer to vol. lx. pt. ii. and vol. lxi. pt. i. of the\r\n     _Gentleman's Magazine_.

You are full of book anecdote of Elizabeth: but do you forget\r\nher schoolmaster, ROGER ASCHAM?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. The master ought certainly to have been mentioned before his\r\npupil. Old Roger is one of my most favourite authors; and I wish\r\nEnglish scholars in general not only to read his works frequently,\r\nbut to imitate the terseness and perspicuity of his style. There is a\r\ngreat deal of information in his treatises, respecting the manners and\r\ncustoms of his times; and as Dr. Johnson has well remarked, \"his\r\nphilological learning would have gained him honour in any\r\ncountry.\"[329] That he was an ardent bibliomaniac, his letters when\r\nupon the continent, are a sufficient demonstration.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 329: ROGER ASCHAM is now, I should hope, pretty\r\n     firmly established among us as one of the very best\r\n     classical writers in our language. Nearly three centuries\r\n     are surely sufficient to consecrate his literary celebrity.\r\n     He is an author of a peculiar and truly original cast. There\r\n     is hardly a dull page or a dull passage in his lucubrations.\r\n     He may be thought, however, to have dealt rather harshly\r\n     with our old romance writers; nor do I imagine that the\r\n     original edition of his _Schoolmaster_ (1571), would be\r\n     placed by a _Morte d'Arthur_ collector alongside of his thin\r\n     black-letter quarto romances. Ascham's invectives against\r\n     the Italian school, and his hard-hearted strictures upon the\r\n     innocent ebullitions of Petrarch and Boccaccio, have been\r\n     noticed, with due judgment and spirit, by Mr. Burnet, in his\r\n     pleasing analysis of our philosopher's works.

This edition, though rather common and cheap,\r\n     should be carefully reprinted in an octavo volume; to\r\n     harmonize with the greater number of our best writers\r\n     published in the same form. But it is time to mention\r\n     something of the author connected with the subject of this\r\n     work. What relates to the BIBLIOMANIA, I here select from\r\n     similar specimens in his English letters, written when he\r\n     was abroad: \"Oct. 4. at afternoon I went about the town [of\r\n     Bruxelles]. I went to the frier Carmelites house, and heard\r\n     their even song: after, I desired to see the LIBRARY. A\r\n     frier was sent to me, and led me into it. There was not one\r\n     good book but _Lyra_. The friar was learned, spoke Latin\r\n     readily, entered into Greek, having a very good wit, and a\r\n     greater desire to learning. He was gentle and honest,\" &c.\r\n     pp. 370-1. \"Oct. 20. to Spira: a good city. Here I first saw\r\n     _Sturmius de Periodis_. I also found here _Ajax_, _Electra_,\r\n     and _Antigone_ of _Sophocles_, excellently, by my good\r\n     judgment, translated into verse, and fair printed this\r\n     summer by Gryphius. Your stationers do ill, that at least do\r\n     not provide you the register of all books, especially of old\r\n     authors,\" &c., p. 372. Again: \"Hieronimus Wolfius, that\r\n     translated Demosthenes and Isocrates, is in this town. I am\r\n     well acquainted with him, and have brought him twice to my\r\n     lord's to dinner. He looks very simple. He telleth me that\r\n     one Borrheus, that hath written well upon Aristot. priorum,\r\n     &c., even now is printing goodly commentaries upon\r\n     Aristotle's Rhetoric. But Sturmius will obscure them all.\"\r\n     p. 381. These extracts are taken from Bennet's edition. Who\r\n     shall hence doubt of the propriety of classing Ascham among\r\n     the most renowned bibliomaniacs of the age?]\r\n\r\nFrom the tutor of Elizabeth let us go to her prime minister,\r\nCECIL.[330] We have already seen how successfully this great man\r\ninterposed in matters of religion; it remains to notice his zealous\r\nactivity in the cause of learning. And of this latter who can possibly\r\nentertain a doubt? Who that has seen how frequently his name is\r\naffixed to Dedications, can disbelieve that Cecil was a LOVER OF\r\nBOOKS? Indeed I question whether it is inserted more frequently in a\r\ndiplomatic document or printed volume. To possess all the presentation\r\ncopies of this illustrious minister would be to possess an ample and\r\nbeautiful library of the literature of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 330: The reader, it is presumed, will not form his\r\n     opinion of the bibliomaniacal taste of this great man, from\r\n     the distorted and shameful delineation of his character,\r\n     which, as a matter of curiosity only, is inserted at p. 237,\r\n     ante. He will, on the contrary, look upon Cecil as a lover\r\n     of books, not for the sake of the numerous panegyrical\r\n     dedications to himself, which he must have so satisfactorily\r\n     perused, but for the sake of the good to be derived from\r\n     useful and ingenious works. With one hand, this great man\r\n     may be said to have wielded the courageous spirit, and\r\n     political virtue, of his country--and with the other, to\r\n     have directed the operations of science and literature.\r\n     Without reading the interesting and well-written life of\r\n     Cecil, in Mr. Macdiarmid's _Lives of British Statesmen_ (a\r\n     work which cannot be too often recommended, or too highly\r\n     praised), there is evidence sufficient of this statesman's\r\n     bibliomaniacal passion and taste, in the FINE OLD LIBRARY\r\n     which is yet preserved at Burleigh in its legitimate\r\n     form--and which, to the collector of such precious volumes,\r\n     must have presented a treat as exquisite as are the fresh\r\n     blown roses of June to him who regales himself in the\r\n     flowery fragrance of his garden--the production of his own\r\n     manual labour! Indeed Strypes tells us that Cecil's \"library\r\n     was a very choice one:\" his care being \"in the preservation,\r\n     rather than in the private possession of (literary)\r\n     antiquities.\" Among other curiosities in it, there was a\r\n     grand, and a sort of presentation, copy of Archbishop\r\n     Parker's Latin work of the _Antiquity of the British\r\n     Church_; \"bound costly, and laid in colours the arms of the\r\n     Church of Canterbury, empaled with the Archbishop's own\r\n     paternal coat.\" Read Strype's tempting description; _Life of\r\n     Parker_; pp. 415, 537. Well might Grafton thus address Cecil\r\n     at the close of his epistolary dedication of his\r\n     _Chronicles_: \"and now having ended this work, and seeking\r\n     to whom I might, for testification of my special good-will,\r\n     present it, or for patronage and defence dedicate it, and\r\n     principally, for all judgment and correction to submit\r\n     it--among many, I have chosen your MASTERSHIP, moved thereto\r\n     by experience of your courteous judgment towards those that\r\n     travail to any honest purpose, rather helping and comforting\r\n     their weakness, than condemning their simple, but yet well\r\n     meaning, endeavours. By which, your accustomed good\r\n     acceptation of others, I am the rather boldened to beseech\r\n     your Mastership to receive this my work and me, in such\r\n     manner as you do those in whom (howsoever there be want of\r\n     power) there wanteth no point of goodwill and serviceable\r\n     affection.\" Edit. 1809, 4to. If a chronicler could talk\r\n     thus, a poet (who, notwithstanding the title of his poem,\r\n     does not, I fear, rank among Pope's bards, that \"sail aloft\r\n     among _the Swans of Thames_,\") may be permitted thus to\r\n     introduce Cecil's name and mansion:\r\n\r\n          Now see these Swannes the new and worthie seate\r\n          Of famous CICILL, treasorer of the land,\r\n          Whose wisedome, counsell skill of Princes state\r\n          The world admires, then Swannes may do the same:\r\n          The house itselfe doth shewe the owner's wit,\r\n          And may for bewtie, state, and every thing,\r\n          Compared be with most within the land,\r\n\r\n          Vallan's _Tale of Two Swannes_, 1590, 4to., reprinted in\r\n            _Leland's Itinerary_; vol. v. p. xiii, edit. 1770.]\r\n\r\nBut the book-loving propensities of Elizabeth's minister were greatly\r\neclipsed by those of her favourite archbishop, PARKER:\r\n\r\n                   clarum et venerabile nomen\r\n     Gentibus, et multum nostræ quod proderat urbi.\r\n\r\nFor my part, Lorenzo, I know of no character, either of this or of any\r\nsubsequent period, which is more entitled to the esteem and veneration\r\nof Englishmen. Pious, diffident, frank, charitable, learned, and\r\nmunificent, Parker was the great episcopal star of his age, which\r\nshone with undiminished lustre to the last moment of its appearance.\r\nIn that warm and irritable period, when the Protestant religion was\r\nassailed in proportion to its excellence, and when writers mistook\r\nabuse for argument, it is delightful to think upon the mild and\r\ntemperate course which this discreet metropolitan pursued! Even with\r\nsuch arrant bibliomaniacs as yourselves, Parker's reputation must\r\nstand as high as that attached to any name, when I inform you that of\r\nhis celebrated work upon the \"_Antiquity of the British Church_\"[331]\r\nare only twenty copies supposed to have been printed. He had a\r\nprivate press, which was worked with types cast at his own expense;\r\nand a more determined book-fancier, and treasurer of ancient lore, did\r\nnot at that time exist in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 331: This is not the place to enter minutely into\r\n     a bibliographical account of the above celebrated work; such\r\n     account being with more propriety reserved for the history\r\n     of our _Typographical Antiquities_. Yet a word or two may be\r\n     here said upon it, in order that the bibliomaniac may not be\r\n     wholly disappointed; and especially as Ames and Herbert have\r\n     been squeamishly reserved in their comunications\r\n     [Transcriber's Note: communications] respecting the same.\r\n     The above volume is, without doubt, one of the scarcest\r\n     books in existence. It has been intimated by Dr. Drake, in\r\n     the preface of his magnificent reprint of it, 1729, fol.,\r\n     that only 20 copies were struck off: but, according to Stype\r\n     [Transcriber's Note: Strype], Parker tells Cecil, in an\r\n     emblazoned copy presented to him by the latter, that he had\r\n     not given the book to _four_ men in the whole realm: and\r\n     peradventure, added he, \"it shall never come to sight\r\n     abroad, though some men, smelling of the printing of it,\r\n     were very desirous cravers of the same.\" _Life of Parker_,\r\n     p. 415. This certainly does not prove any thing respecting\r\n     the number of copies printed; but it is probable that Dr.\r\n     Drake's supposition is not far short of the truth. One thing\r\n     is remarkable: of all the copies known, no two are found to\r\n     accord with each other. The archbishop seems to have altered\r\n     and corrected the sheets as they each came from the press.\r\n     The omission of the Archbishop's own life in this volume, as\r\n     it contained the biography of 69 archbishops, exclusively of\r\n     himself, was endeavoured to be supplied by the publication\r\n     of a sharp satirical tract, entitled, \"_The life off the 70\r\n     Archbishop of Canterbury, presenttye sittinge Englished, and\r\n     to be added to the 69 lately sett forth in Latin_,\" &c.,\r\n     12mo., 1574. After this title page there is another.\r\n     \"_Histriola, a little storye of the acts and life of Mathew,\r\n     now Archbishoppe of Canterb._\" This latter comprehends 17\r\n     leaves, and was written either by the archbishop himself, or\r\n     by his Chaplain Joscelyne; but whether it be at all like a\r\n     distinct printed folio tract, of twelve leaves and a half,\r\n     which was kept carefully undispersed in the archbishop's own\r\n     possession, 'till his death--being also a biography of\r\n     Parker--I am not able to ascertain. The following extracts\r\n     from it (as it is a scarce little volume) may be acceptable,\r\n\r\n     _Archbishop Parker's early Studies and popular Preaching._\r\n\r\n     \"But now, he being very well and perfectly instructed in the\r\n     liberal sciences, he applied all his mind to the study of\r\n     divinity, and to the reading of the volumes of the\r\n     ecclesiastical fathers; and that so earnestly that, in short\r\n     space of time, he bestowed his labour not unprofitably in\r\n     this behalf; for, after the space of four or five years, he,\r\n     issuing from his secret and solitary study into open\r\n     practice in the commonwealth, preached every where unto the\r\n     people with great commendation; and that in the most famous\r\n     cities and places of this realm, by the authority of King\r\n     Henry VIII., by whose letters patent this was granted unto\r\n     him, together with the license of the Archbishop of\r\n     Canterbury. In execution of this function of preaching, he\r\n     gained this commodity; that the fame of him came unto the\r\n     ears of King Henry,\" &c. Sign. A. iij. recto.\r\n\r\n     _His attention to Literature and Printing, &c._\r\n\r\n     \"----he was very careful, and not without some charges, to\r\n     seek the monuments of former times; to know the religion of\r\n     the ancient fathers, and those especially which were of the\r\n     English church. Therefore in seeking up the Chronicles of\r\n     the Britons and English Saxons, which lay hidden every where\r\n     contemned and buried in forgetfulness, and through the\r\n     ignorance of the languages not well understanded, his own\r\n     especially, and his mens, diligence wanted not. And to the\r\n     end that these antiquities might last long, and be carefully\r\n     kept, he caused them, being brought into one place, _to be\r\n     well bound and trimly covered_. And yet, not so contented,\r\n     he endeavoured to set out in print certain of those ancient\r\n     monuments, whereof he knew very few examples to be extant;\r\n     and which he thought would be most profitable for the\r\n     posterity, to instruct them in the faith and religion of the\r\n     elders. [Orig. 'to instructe them in the faythe and religion\r\n     off the elders.] Hereupon, he caused the perpetual histories\r\n     of the English affairs, by _Mathæus Parisiensis_, once a\r\n     monk of Saint Alban's, and _Mathæus Florilegus_, a monk of\r\n     Saint Peter in Westminster, written in Latin, to be printed;\r\n     after he had diligently conferred them with the examples\r\n     which he could get in any place; to the end that, as\r\n     sincerely as might be, as the authors first left them, he\r\n     might deliver them into other men's hands. Lastly, that he\r\n     might not be unmindful of those monuments which, both in\r\n     antiquity, worthiness, and authority, excelled all other, or\r\n     rather wherewith none are to be compared (I mean the Holy\r\n     Scriptures) here he thought to do great good if, by his\r\n     number, he increased the _Holy Bibles_, which shortly would\r\n     be wanting to many churches, if this discommodity were not\r\n     provided for in time. Therefore it seemed good unto him,\r\n     first, with his learned servants, to examine thoroughly the\r\n     English translation; wherein he partly used the help of his\r\n     brethren bishops, and other doctors; with whom he dealt so\r\n     diligently in this matter that they disdained not to be\r\n     partners and fellows with him of his labor. And now all\r\n     their work is set out in very fair forms and letters of\r\n     print,\" &c. Sign.

C. iiij. rev. The\r\n     satirical part, beginning with \"To the Christian Reader,\"\r\n     follows the biography from which these extracts have been\r\n     taken. It remains to observe, that our ARCHBISHOP was a\r\n     bibliomaniac of the very first order; and smitten with every\r\n     thing attached to a BOOK, to a degree beyond any thing\r\n     exhibited by his contemporaries. Parker did not scruple to\r\n     tell Cecil that he kept in his house \"drawers of pictures,\r\n     wood-cutters, painters, limners, writers, and\r\n     book-binders,\"--\"one of these was LYLYE, an excellent\r\n     writer, that could counterfeit any antique writing. Him the\r\n     archbishop customarily used to make old books\r\n     compleat,\"--&c. _Strype's Life of Parker_; pp. 415, 529.\r\n     Such was his ardour for book-collecting that he had agents\r\n     in almost all places, abroad and at home, for the purpose of\r\n     securing everything that was curious, precious, and rare:\r\n     and one of these, of the name of Batman (I suppose the\r\n     commentator upon Bartholomæus) \"in the space of no more than\r\n     four years, procured for our archbishop to the number of\r\n     6700 books.\" _Id._ p. 528. The riches of his book bequests\r\n     to Cambridge are sufficiently described by Strype; pp. 501,\r\n     518, 519, 529, &c. The domestic habits and personal\r\n     appearance of PARKER are described by his biographer (p.\r\n     504) as being simple and grave. Notwithstanding his aversion\r\n     to wearing silk, to plays and jests, and hawks and hounds\r\n     (even when he was a young man), I take it for granted he\r\n     could have no inward dislike to the beautiful and\r\n     appropriate ceremony which marked his consecration, and\r\n     which is thus narrated by the lively pen of Fuller: \"The\r\n     east part of the chapel of Lambeth was hung with tapestry,\r\n     the floor spread with red cloth, chairs and cushions are\r\n     conveniently placed for the purpose: morning prayers being\r\n     solemnly read by Andrew Peerson, the archbishop's chaplain,\r\n     Bishop Scory went up into the pulpit, and took for his text,\r\n     _The Elders which are among you I exhort, who also am an\r\n     elder; and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, &c._\r\n     Sermon ended, and the sacrament administered, they proceed\r\n     to the consecration. The ARCHBISHOP had his rochet on, with\r\n     HEREFORD; and the suffragan of Bedford, CHICHESTER, wore a\r\n     silk cope; and COVERDALE a plain cloth gown down to his\r\n     ancles. All things are done conformable to the book of\r\n     ordination: Litany sung; the Queen's patent for Parker's\r\n     consecration audibly read by Dr. Vale: He is presented: the\r\n     oath of supremacy tendered to him; taken by him; hands\r\n     reverently imposed on him; and all with prayers begun,\r\n     continued, concluded. In a word, though here was no\r\n     theatrical pomp to made it a popish pageant; though no\r\n     sandals, gloves, ring, staff, oil, pall, &c., were used upon\r\n     him--yet there was ceremony enough to clothe his\r\n     consecration with decency, though not to clog it with\r\n     superstition.\" _Church History_, b. ix., p. 60. But the\r\n     virtues of the primate, however mild and unostentatious,\r\n     were looked upon with an envious eye by the maligant\r\n     observer of human nature; and the spontaneous homage which\r\n     he received from some of the first noblemen in the realm was\r\n     thus lampooned in the satirical composition just before\r\n     noticed:\r\n\r\n     _Homage and Tribute paid to Archbishop Parker._\r\n\r\n     \"The next is, what great tributes every made bishop paid\r\n     him. How they entertained his whole household or court, for\r\n     the time, with sumptuous feasting. How dearly they redeemed\r\n     their own cloaths, and carpets, at his chaplain's hands.\r\n     What fees were bestowed on his crucifer, marshall, and other\r\n     servants. All which plentiful bounty, or rather, he might\r\n     have said, largess, is shrunk up, he saith, to a small sum\r\n     of ten pounds, somewhat beside, but very small, bestowed, he\r\n     might have said cast away, upon the archbishop's family,\r\n     &c.--The same earl (of Gloucester) must be his steward and\r\n     chief cupbearer, the day of his inthronization: This is not\r\n     to be called gracious Lords, as the Lords of the earth, but\r\n     this is to be beyond all grace; and to be served of these\r\n     gracious Lords, and to be their Lord paramount. In this roll\r\n     of his noble tenants, the next are the Lord Strangways, the\r\n     Earl of Oxford, the Lord Dacy, all which (saith he) owe\r\n     service to that Archbishop. Then descendeth he to the gifts\r\n     that every his suffragan provincial bishop bestoweth on him,\r\n     in their life, and at their death: some their palfrey with\r\n     saddle and furniture; some their rings, and some their\r\n     seals. Among the rest, the Bishop of Rochester, who is there\r\n     called specially his chaplain, giveth him a brace of dogs.\r\n     These be trim things for prelates to give or receive;\r\n     especially of them to make such account as to print them\r\n     among such special prerogatives.\" Sign.

You have called the reign of Henry the Seventh the\r\nAUGUSTAN-BOOK-AGE; but, surely, this distinction is rather due to the\r\næra of Queen Elizabeth?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Both periods merit the appellation. In Henry's time, the\r\ninvention of printing was of early growth; but the avidity of readers\r\nconsiderable. The presses of Rome, Venice, and Paris, sent forth their\r\ncostly productions; and a new light, by such means, was poured upon\r\nthe darkened mind. Our own presses began to contribute to the\r\ndiffusion of this light; and, compared with the preceding part of the\r\nfifteenth century, the reign of Henry VII. was highly distinguished\r\nfor its bibliomaniacal celebrity. Undoubtedly, the æra of Queen\r\nElizabeth was the GOLDEN AGE of Bibliomaniacism.\r\n\r\nDo not let me forget, in my rambling method of treating of books and\r\nbook-men, the name and celebrity of the renowned DR. JOHN DEE. Let us\r\nfancy we see him in his conjuring cap and robes--surrounded with\r\nastrological, mathematical, and geographical instruments--with a\r\nprofusion of Chaldee characters inscribed upon vellum rolls--and with\r\nhis celebrated _Glass_ suspended by magical wires. Let us then follow\r\nhim into his study at midnight, and view him rummaging his books;\r\ncontemplating the heavens; making calculations; holding converse with\r\ninvisible spirits; writing down their responses: anon, looking into\r\nhis correspondence with _Count a Lasco_ and the emperors Adolphus and\r\nMaximilian; and pronouncing himself, with the most heartfelt\r\ncomplacency, the greatest genius of his age![332] In the midst of\r\nthese self-complacent reveries, let us imagine we see his wife and\r\nlittle ones intruding; beseeching him to burn his books and\r\ninstruments; and reminding him that there was neither a silver spoon,\r\nnor a loaf of bread, in the cupboard. Alas, poor DEE!--thou wert the\r\ndupe of the people and of the Court: and, although Meric Casaubon has\r\nenshrined thy conjurations in a pompous folio volume, thy name, I\r\nfear, will only live in the memory of bibliomaniacs!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 332: Those who are fond of copious biographical\r\n     details of astrologers and conjurers will read, with no\r\n     small pleasure and avidity, the long gossipping account of\r\n     DEE, which Hearne has subjoined to his edition of _John\r\n     Confrat.

This is true enough; for such a farago of\r\n     incongruous, risible, and horrible events, are no where else\r\n     recorded. \"None but itself can be its parallel.\" Casaubon\r\n     wrote a professed dissertation (1652, 8vo.) upon witches,\r\n     and nothing seemed to be too unpalatable for his credulity\r\n     to swallow. A compressed and rather interesting account of\r\n     Dee, who was really the weakest as well as the ablest\r\n     scholar and philosopher of his day, will be found in\r\n     Ashmole's _Theatrum Chemicum_, p. 480. From the substance of\r\n     these authorities, the reader is presented with the\r\n     following sketch. The first chapter in Hearne's publication,\r\n     which treats of the \"entrance and ground plot of his first\r\n     studies,\" informs us that he had received his Latin\r\n     education in London and Chelmsford: that he was born in\r\n     July, 1527, and at 15 years of age was entered at the\r\n     University of Cambridge, 1542. In the three following years,\r\n     \"so vehemently was he bent to study that, for those years,\r\n     he did inviolably keep this order; only to sleep 4 hours\r\n     every night; to allow to meat and drink (and some refreshing\r\n     after) 2 hours every day; and of the other 18 hours, all\r\n     (excepting the time of going to, and being at, divine\r\n     service) was spent in his studies and learning.\" In May,\r\n     1547, after having taken his Bachelor's decree, he went\r\n     abroad. \"And after some months spent about the Low\r\n     Countries, he returned home, and brought with him the first\r\n     astronomer's staff in brass, that was made of Gemma Frisius\r\n     devising; the two great globes of Gerardus Mercator's\r\n     making, and the astronomer's ring of brass, as Gemma Frisius\r\n     had newly framed it.\" Dee's head now began to run wild upon\r\n     astronomy, or rather astrology; and the tremendous\r\n     assistance of the \"occult art\" was called in to give effect\r\n     to the lectures which he read upon it at home and abroad.\r\n     \"He did set forth (and it was seen of the University) a\r\n     Greek comedy of Aristophanes, named, in Greek, [Greek:\r\n     eirênê], in Latin, _Pax_; with the performance of the\r\n     _Scarabæus_ his flying up to Jupiter's palace, with a man\r\n     and his basket of victuals on his back: whereat was great\r\n     wondering and many vain reports spread abroad of the means\r\n     how that was effected. In that college (Trinity, for he had\r\n     now left St. John's), by his advice and endeavours, was\r\n     their Christmas magistrate first named and confirmed an\r\n     EMPEROR.\" The first emperor of this sort, (whose _name_, it\r\n     must be confessed, is rather unpopular in a University) he\r\n     takes care to inform us, \"was one Mr. Thomas _Dun_, a very\r\n     goodly man of person, stature, and complexion, and well\r\n     learned also.\" Dee afterwards ranks these things among \"his\r\n     boyish attempts and exploits scholastical.\" In 1548 he was\r\n     made Master of Arts, and in the same year \"went over beyond\r\n     the seas again, and never after that was any more student in\r\n     Cambridge.\" Abroad, almost every emperor and nobleman of\r\n     distinction, according to his own account, came to see and\r\n     hear him. \"For recreation, he looked into the method of the\r\n     civil law, and profitted therein so much that, in\r\n     _Antinomiis_, imagined to be in the law, he had good hap to\r\n     find out (well allowed of) their agreements; and also to\r\n     enter into a plain and due understanding of diverse civil\r\n     laws, accounted very intricate and dark.\" At Paris, when he\r\n     gave lectures upon Euclid's elements, \"a thing never done\r\n     publicly in any university in Christendom, his auditory in\r\n     Rhemes college was so great, and the most part elder than\r\n     himself, that the mathematical schools could not hold them;\r\n     for many were fain, without the schools, at the windows, to\r\n     be _Auditores et Spectatores_, as they could best help\r\n     themselves thereto. And by the first four principal\r\n     definitions representing to their eyes (which by imagination\r\n     only are exactly to be conceived) a greater wonder arose\r\n     among the beholders than of his _Aristophanes Scarabæus_\r\n     mounting up to the top of Trinity Hall, _ut supra_.\"\r\n     Notwithstanding the tempting offers to cause him to be\r\n     domiciled in France and Germany, our astrologer, like a true\r\n     patriot, declined them all. The French king offered an\r\n     annual stipend of 200 French crowns; a Monsieur Babeu,\r\n     Monsieur de Rohan, and Monsieur de Monluc, offered still\r\n     greater sums, but were all refused. In Germany he was\r\n     tempted with the yearly salary of 3000 dollars; \"and lastly,\r\n     by a messenger from the Russie or Muscovite Emperor,\r\n     purposely sent with a very rich present unto him at Trebona\r\n     castle, and with provision for the whole journey (being\r\n     above 1200 miles from the castle where he lay) of his coming\r\n     to his court at Moscow, with his wife, children, and whole\r\n     family, there to enjoy at his imperial hands 2000 lib.\r\n     sterling yearly stipend; and of his Protector yearly a\r\n     thousand rubles; with his diet also to be allowed him free\r\n     out of the emperor's own kitchen: and to be in dignity with\r\n     authority amongst the highest sort of the nobility there,\r\n     and of his Privy Counsellors.\"--But all this was heroically\r\n     declined by our patriotic philosopher. Lord Pembroke and\r\n     Lord Leicester introduced Dee to the notice of Q. Elizabeth,\r\n     before her coronation. At which time her Majesty used these\r\n     words--\"_Where my brother hath given him a crown, I will\r\n     give him a noble!_\" Before the accession of Elizabeth, he\r\n     was imprisoned on being accused of destroying Queen Mary by\r\n     enchantment. \"The Queen Elizabeth herself became a prisoner\r\n     in the same place (Hampton Court) shortly afterwards; and\r\n     Dee had for bedfellow one Barthelet Green, who was\r\n     afterwards burnt.\" Dee himself was examined by Bishop\r\n     Bonner. On the deanery of Gloucester becoming void in 1564,\r\n     Dee was nominated to fill it: but the same deanery was\r\n     afterwards bestowed on Mr. Man, who was sent into Spain in\r\n     her Majesty's service. \"And now this Lent, 1594, when it\r\n     became void again (says Dee), I made a motion for it, but I\r\n     came too late; for one that might spend 400 or 500 lib. a\r\n     year already, had more need of it than I belike; or else\r\n     this former gift was but words only to me, and the fruit\r\n     ever due to others, that can espy and catch better than I\r\n     for these 35 years could do.\" Mistris Blanche à Parry came\r\n     to his house with an offer from the Queen of \"any\r\n     ecclesiastical dignity within her kingdom, being then, or\r\n     shortly becoming, void and vacant\"--but \"Dee's most humble\r\n     and thankful answer to her Majesty, by the same messenger,\r\n     was that _cura animarum annexa_ did terrifie him to deal\r\n     with.\" He was next promised to \"have of her Majesty's gift\r\n     other ecclesiastical livings and revenues (without care of\r\n     souls annexed) as in her Majesty's books were rated at two\r\n     hundred pounds yearly revenue; of which her Majesty's gift\r\n     he never as yet had any one penny.\" In Oct. 1578, he had a\r\n     consultation with Mr. Doctor Bayly, her Majesty's physician,\r\n     \"about her Majestie's grievous pangs and pains by reason of\r\n     the toothake and rheum,\" &c. \"He set down in writing, with\r\n     hydrographical and geographical description, what he then\r\n     had to say or shew, as concerning her Majesty's title royal\r\n     to any foreign countries. Whereof two parchment great rolls\r\n     full written, of about XII WHITE VELLUM SKINS, were good\r\n     witnesses upon the table before the commissioners.\" Dee had\r\n     refused an hundred pounds for these calligraphical labours.\r\n     A list of his printed and unprinted works: the former 8\r\n     (ending with the year 1573), the latter 36 (ending with the\r\n     year 1592), in number. Anno 1563, Julii ultimo, the Earl of\r\n     Leicester and Lord Laskey invited themselves to dine with\r\n     Dee in a day or two; but our astrologer \"confessed sincerely\r\n     that he was not able to prepare them a convenient dinner,\r\n     unless he should presently sell some of his plate or some of\r\n     his pewter for it. Whereupon,\" continues Dee, \"her Majesty\r\n     sent unto me very royally within one hour after forty angels\r\n     of gold, from Sion; whither her Majesty was now come by\r\n     water from Greenwich.\" A little before Christmas, 1599, Dee\r\n     mentions a promise of another royal donation of\r\n     100_l._--\"which intent and promise, some once or twice\r\n     after, as he came in her Majesty's sight, she repeated unto\r\n     him; and thereupon sent unto him _fifty pounds_ to keep his\r\n     Christmas with that year--but what, says he, is become of\r\n     the other fifty, truly I cannot tell! If her Majesty can, it\r\n     is sufficient; '_Satis, citò, modò, satis bene_, must I\r\n     say.'\" In 1591, his patroness, the Countess of Warwick, made\r\n     a powerful diversion at Court to secure for him the\r\n     mastership of St. Cross, then filled by Dr. Bennet, who was\r\n     to be made a bishop.--The queen qualified her promise of\r\n     Dee's having it with a nota bene, _if he should be fit for\r\n     it_. In 1592, the Archbishop of Canterbury openly \"affirmed\r\n     that the mastership of St. Crosse was a living most fit for\r\n     him; and the Lord Treasurer, at Hampton Court, lately to\r\n     himself declared, and with his hand very earnestly smitten\r\n     on his breast used these very words to him--'_By my faith_,\r\n     if her Majestie be moved in it by any other for you, I will\r\n     do what I can with her Majestie to pleasure you therein, Mr.\r\n     Dee.'\" But it is time to gratify the BIBLIOMANIAC with\r\n     something more to his palate. Here followeth, therefore, as\r\n     drawn up by our philosopher himself, an account of\r\n\r\n     DEE'S LIBRARY:\r\n\r\n     \"4000 _Volumes_--printed and unprinted--bound and\r\n     unbound--valued at 2000 _lib._\r\n\r\n     1 Greek, 2 French, and 1 High Dutch, volumes of MSS., alone\r\n     worth 533 _lib._ 40 years in getting these books together.\"\r\n\r\n     Appertaining thereto,\r\n\r\n     _Sundry rare and exquisitely made Mathematical Instruments._\r\n\r\n     _A radius Astronomicus_, ten feet long.\r\n\r\n     _A Magnet Stone, or Loadstone_; of great virtue--\"which was\r\n     sold out of the library for _v shill._ and for it afterwards\r\n     (yea piece-meal divided) was more than xx _lib._ given in\r\n     money and value.\"\r\n\r\n     \"_A great case or frame of boxes_, wherein some hundreds of\r\n     very rare evidences of divers Irelandish territories,\r\n     provinces, and lands, were laid up. Which territories,\r\n     provinces, and lands were therein notified to have been in\r\n     the hands of some of the ancient Irish princes. Then, their\r\n     submissions and tributes agreed upon, with seals appendant\r\n     to the little writings thereof in parchment: and after by\r\n     some of those evidences did it appear how some of those\r\n     lands came to the Lascies, the Mortuomars, the Burghs, the\r\n     Clares,\" &c.\r\n\r\n     \"_A box of Evidences_ antient of some Welch princes and\r\n     noblemen--the like of Norman donation--their peculiar titles\r\n     noted on the forepart with chalk only, which on the poor\r\n     boxes remaineth.\" This box, with another, containing similar\r\n     deeds, were embezzled.\r\n\r\n     \"One great bladder with about 4 pound weight, of a very\r\n     sweetish thing, like a brownish gum in it, artificially\r\n     prepared by thirty times purifying of it, hath more than I\r\n     could well afford him for 100 crownes; as may be proved by\r\n     witnesses yet living.\"\r\n\r\n     To these he adds his _three Laboratories_, \"serving for\r\n     Pyrotechnia\"--which he got together after 20 years' labour.\r\n     \"All which furniture and provision, and many things already\r\n     prepared, is unduly made away from me by sundry meanes, and\r\n     a few spoiled or broken vessels remain, hardly worth 40\r\n     shillings.\" But one more feature in poor Dee's\r\n     character--and that is his unparalleled serenity and good\r\n     nature under the most griping misfortunes--remains to be\r\n     described: and then we may take farewell of him, with aching\r\n     hearts. In the 10th chapter, speaking of the wretched\r\n     poverty of himself and family--(\"having not one penny of\r\n     certain fee, revenue, stipend, or pension, either left him\r\n     or restored unto him,\")--Dee says that \"he has been\r\n     constrained now and then to send parcels of his little\r\n     furniture of plate to pawn upon usury; and that he did so\r\n     oft, till no more could be sent. After the same manner went\r\n     his wives' jewels of gold, rings, bracelets, chains, and\r\n     other their rarities, under the thraldom of the usurer's\r\n     gripes: 'till _non plus_ was written upon the boxes at\r\n     home.\" In the 11th chapter, he anticipates the dreadful lot\r\n     of being brought \"to the stepping out of doors (his house\r\n     being sold). He, and his, with bottles and wallets\r\n     furnished, to become wanderers as homish vagabonds; or, as\r\n     banished men, to forsake the kingdom!\" Again: \"with bloody\r\n     tears of heart, he, and his wife, their seven children, and\r\n     their servant (seventeen of them in all), did that day make\r\n     their petition unto their honours,\" &c. Can human misery be\r\n     sharper than this--and to be the lot of a philosopher and\r\n     bibliomaniac?! But \"VENIET FELICIUS ÆVUM.\"]\r\n\r\nOf a wholly different cast of character and of reading was the\r\nrenowned CAPTAIN COX of Coventry. How many of Dee's magical books he\r\nhad exchanged for the pleasanter magic of _Old Ballads_ and\r\n_Romances_, I will not take upon me to say; but that this said\r\nbibliomaniacal Captain had a library, which, even from Master\r\nLaneham's imperfect description of it,[333] I should have preferred\r\nto the four thousand volumes of Dr. John Dee, is most nuquestionable\r\n[Transcriber's Note: unquestionable].\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 333: Let us be introduced to the sprightly figure\r\n     and expression of character of this renowned Coventry\r\n     captain, before we speak particularly of his library.\r\n     \"CAPTAIN COX (says the above-mentioned Master Laneham) came\r\n     marching on valiantly before, clean trust and gartered above\r\n     the knee, all fresh in a velvet cap (Master Golding a lent\r\n     it him), flourishing with his _ton_ sword; and another fence\r\n     master with him:\" p. 39. A little before, he is thus\r\n     described as connected with his library: \"And first, Captain\r\n     Cox; an odd man, I promise you: by profession a mason, and\r\n     that right skilful: very cunning in fens (fencing); and\r\n     hardy as Gawin; for his _ton_ sword hangs at his table's\r\n     end. Great oversight hath he in matters of story: for as for\r\n     _King Arthur's_ Book, _Huon of Bourdeaux_, the _Four Sons of\r\n     Aymon_, _Bevys of Hampton_, _The Squyre of Low Degree_, _The\r\n     Knight of Curtsy_, and the _Lady Fagnel_, _Frederick of\r\n     Gene_, _Syr Eglamour_, _Syr Tryamour_, _Syr Lamurell_, _Syr\r\n     Isenbras_, _Syr Gawyn_, _Olyver of the Castl_, _Lucres and\r\n     Eurialus_, _Virgil's Life_, _the Castl of Ladies_, _the\r\n     Widow Edyth_, _the King and the Tanner_, _Frier Rous_,\r\n     _Howleglas_, _Gargantua_, _Robin Hood_, _Adam Bel_, _Clim on\r\n     the Clough_, and _William of Cloudsley_, _the Churl and the\r\n     Burd_, _the Seaven Wise Masters_, _the Wife lapt in a\r\n     Morel's skin_, _the Sakful of Nuez_, _the Sergeaunt that\r\n     became a Fryar_, _Skogan_, _Collyn Cloout_, _the Fryar and\r\n     the Boy_, _Elynor Rumming_, and _the Nutbrooun Maid_, with\r\n     many more than I rehearse here. I believe he has them all at\r\n     his finger's ends,\" p. 36. The preceding is a list of the\r\n     worthy Captain's ROMANCES; some of which, at least in their\r\n     original shape, were unknown to Ritson: what would be the\r\n     amount of their present produce under the hammer of those\r\n     renowned black-letter-book auctioneers in King-street,\r\n     Covent Garden--? Speak we, in the next place, of the said\r\n     military bibliomaniac's collection of books in \"PHILOSOPHY\r\n     MORAL and NATURAL.\" \"Beside _Poetry_ and _Astronomy_, and\r\n     other hid sciences, as I may guess by the omberty of his\r\n     books: whereof part are, as I remember, _The Shepherd's\r\n     Kalendar_, _the Ship of Fools_, _Daniel's Dreams_, _the Book\r\n     of Fortune_, _Stans_, _puer ad mensam_, _the bye way to the\r\n     Spitl-house_, _Julian of Brainford's Testament_, _the Castle\r\n     of Love_, _the Booget of Demaunds_, _the Hundred Mery\r\n     Talez_, _the Book of Riddels_, _the Seaven Sorows of Wemen_,\r\n     _the Proud Wives' Pater-Noster_, _the Chapman of a\r\n     Penniworth of Wit_: Beside his AUNCIENT PLAYS; _Youth and\r\n     Charitee_, _Hikskorner_, _Nugize_, _Impacient Poverty_, and\r\n     herewith Doctor _Boord's Breviary of Health_. What should I\r\n     rehearse here, what a bunch of BALLADS AND SONGS, all\r\n     ancient?!--Here they come, gentle reader; lift up thine eyen\r\n     and marvel while thou dost peruse the same: _Broom Broom on\r\n     Hill_, _So wo iz me begon_, _trolly lo Over a Whinny Meg_,\r\n     _Hey ding a ding_, _Bony lass upon a green_, _My bony on\r\n     gave me a bek_, _By a bank az I lay_; and _two more_ he hath\r\n     fair wrapt up in parchment, and bound with a whipcord!\" It\r\n     is no wonder that Ritson, in the historical essay prefixed\r\n     to his collection of _Scottish Songs_, should speak of some\r\n     of these ballads with a zest as if he would have sacrificed\r\n     half his library to untie the said \"whipcord\" packet. And\r\n     equally joyous, I ween, would my friend Mr. R.H. Evans, of\r\n     Pall-Mall, have been--during his editorial labours in\r\n     publishing a new edition of his father's collection of\r\n     Ballads--(an edition, by the bye, which gives us more of the\r\n     genuine spirit of the COXEAN COLLECTION than any with which\r\n     I am acquainted)--equally joyous would Mr. Evans have been\r\n     to have had the inspection of some of these 'bonny' songs.\r\n     The late Duke of Roxburgh, of never-dying bibliomaniacal\r\n     celebrity, would have parted with half the insignia of his\r\n     order of the Garter to have obtained _clean original copies_\r\n     of these fascinating effusions! But let us return, and take\r\n     farewell of Captain Cox, by noticing only the remaining\r\n     department of his library, as described by Laneham. \"As for\r\n     ALMANACS of antiquity (a point for Ephemerides) I ween he\r\n     can shew from _Jasper Laet of Antwerp_, unto _Nostradam of\r\n     Frauns_, and thence unto our _John Securiz of Salisbury_. To\r\n     stay ye no longer herein (concludes Laneham) I dare say he\r\n     hath as fair a library of these sciences, and as many goodly\r\n     monuments both in prose and poetry, and at afternoon can\r\n     talk as much without book, as any innholder betwixt\r\n     Brentford and Bagshot, what degree soever he be.\" _A Letter\r\n     wherein part of the Entertainment untoo the Queenz Majesty\r\n     at Killingwoorth Castl in Warwick-Sheer, in this Soomerz\r\n     Progrest, 1575, is signefied_: Warwick, 1784, 8vo. O RARE\r\n     CAPTAIN COX!]\r\n\r\nWe now approach two characters of a more dignified cast; and who, in\r\nevery respect, must be denominated the greatest bibliomaniacs of the\r\nage: I mean SIR ROBERT COTTON and SIR THOMAS BODLEY. We will touch\r\nupon them separately.\r\n\r\nThe numerous relics which are yet preserved of the _Cottonian\r\nCollection_, may serve to convey a pretty strong idea of its splendour\r\nand perfection in its original shape. Cotton had all the sagacity and\r\njudgment of Lord Coke, with a more beautifully polished mind, and a\r\nmore benevolent heart. As to books, and book men, he was the\r\nMecænas[334] of his day. His thirst for knowledge could never be\r\nsatiated; and the cultivation of the mind upon the foundation of a\r\ngood heart, he considered to be the highest distinction, and the most\r\npermanent delight, of human beings. Wealth, pomp, parade, and titles,\r\nwere dissipated, in the pure atmosphere of his mind before the\r\ninvigorating sun of science and learning. He knew that the tomb which\r\nrecorded the _worth_ of the deceased had more honest tears shed upon\r\nit than the pompous mausoleum which spoke only of his pedigree and\r\npossessions. Accordingly, although he had excellent blood flowing in\r\nhis veins, Cotton sought connection with the good rather than with the\r\ngreat; and where he found a cultivated understanding, and an honest\r\nheart, there he carried with him his _Lares_, and made another's\r\nabode his own.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 334: There are few eminent characters of whom so\r\n     many, and such ably-executed, memoirs are extant as of SIR\r\n     ROBERT COTTON, KNT. In the present place we have nothing to\r\n     do with his academical studies, his philosophical, or\r\n     legislative, or diplomatic, labours: literature and _Book\r\n     Madness_ are our only subjects of discussion. Yet those who\r\n     may wish for more general, and possibly more interesting,\r\n     details, may examine the authorities referred to by Mr.\r\n     Planta in his very excellent _Catalogue of the MSS. in the\r\n     Cottonian Library_, 1802, folio. Sir Robert Cotton was\r\n     educated at Trinity-College, Cambridge. The number of\r\n     curious volumes, whether in the roman, gothic, or italic\r\n     type, which he in all probability collected during his\r\n     residence at the university, has not yet been ascertained;\r\n     but we know that, when he made his antiquarian tour with the\r\n     famous Camden, (\"par nobile fratrum!\") in his 29th year,\r\n     Cotton must have greatly augmented his literary treasures,\r\n     and returned to the metropolis with a sharpened appetite, to\r\n     devour every thing in the shape of a book. Respected by\r\n     three sovereigns, Elizabeth, James, and Charles, and admired\r\n     by all the literati in Europe, Sir Robert saw himself in as\r\n     eminent a situation as wealth, talents, taste, and integrity\r\n     can place an individual. His collection of books increased\r\n     rapidly; but MS. records, deeds, and charters, were the\r\n     chief objects of his pursuit. His mansion was noble, his\r\n     library extensive, and his own manners such as conciliated\r\n     the esteem of almost every one who approached him. Dr. Smith\r\n     has well described our illustrious bibliomaniac, at this\r\n     golden period of his life: \"Ad Cottoni ædes, tanquam ad\r\n     communem reconditioris doctrinæ apothecam, sive ad novam\r\n     Academiam, quotquot animo paulo erectiori musis et gratiis\r\n     litaverint, sese recepere, nullam a viro humanissimo\r\n     repulsam passuri: quippe idem literas bonas promovendi\r\n     studium erat omni auctoramento longe potentius. Nec ista\r\n     obvia morum facilitas, qua omnes bonos eruditionisque\r\n     candidatos complexus est, quicquam reverentiæ qua vicissim\r\n     ille colebatur, detraxerat: potius, omnium, quos familiari\r\n     sermone, repititisque colloquiis dignari placuit, in se\r\n     amores et admirationem hac insigni naturæ benignitate\r\n     excitavit.\" Vit. Rob. Cottoni, p. xxiv., prefixed to the\r\n     _Catalogus Librorum Manuscriptorum Bibl. Cott._, 1696,\r\n     folio. Sir Robert was, however, doomed to have the evening\r\n     of his life clouded by one of those crooked and disastrous\r\n     events, of which it is now impossible to trace the correct\r\n     cause, or affix the degree of ignominy attached to it, on\r\n     the head of its proper author. Human nature has few blacker\r\n     instances of turpitude on record than that to which our\r\n     knight fell a victim. In the year 1615, some wretch\r\n     communicated to the Spanish ambassador \"the valuable state\r\n     papers in his library, who caused them to be copied and\r\n     translated into the Spanish:\" these papers were of too much\r\n     importance to be made public; and James the 1st had the\r\n     meanness to issue a commission \"which excluded Sir Robert\r\n     from his own library.\" The storm quickly blew over, and the\r\n     sunshine of Cotton's integrity diffused around its wonted\r\n     brilliancy. But in the year 1629, another mischievous wretch\r\n     propagated a report that Sir Robert had been privy to a\r\n     treasonable publication: because, forsooth, the original\r\n     tract, from which this treasonable one had been taken, was,\r\n     in the year 1613, without the knowledge of the owner of the\r\n     library, introduced into the Cottonian collection. This\r\n     wretch, under the abused title of librarian, had, \"for\r\n     pecuniary considerations,\" the baseness to suffer one or\r\n     more copies of the pamphlet of 1613 (writtten [Transcriber's\r\n     Note: written] at Florence by Dudley, Duke of\r\n     Northumberland, under a less offensive title) to be taken,\r\n     and in consequence printed. Sir Robert was therefore again\r\n     singled out for royal vengeance: his library was put under\r\n     sequestration; and the owner forbidden to enter it. It was\r\n     in vain that his complete innocence was vindicated. To\r\n     deprive such a man as COTTON of the ocular and manual\r\n     comforts of his library--to suppose that he could be happy\r\n     in the most splendid drawing room in Europe, without his\r\n     books--is to suppose what our experience of virtuous\r\n     bibliomaniacs will not permit us to accede to. In\r\n     consequence, Sir Robert declared to his friends, \"that they\r\n     had broken his heart who had locked up his library from\r\n     him:\" which declaration he solemnly repeated to the Privy\r\n     Council. In the year 1631, this great and good man closed\r\n     his eyes for ever upon mortal scenes; upon those whom he\r\n     gladdened by his benevolence, and improved by his wisdom.\r\n     Such was the man, of whom Gale has thus eloquently\r\n     spoken:--\"quisquis bona fide Historiam nostram per omne ævum\r\n     explicare sataget, nullum laudatum Scriptorem à se\r\n     desiderari exoptarique posse, quem COTTONIANUS ille\r\n     incomparabilis thesaurus promptissime non exhibebit: Ea est,\r\n     et semper fuit, nobilis Domus ergo literatos\r\n     indulgentia--Hujus fores (ut illæ Musaram, apud Pindarum)\r\n     omnibus patent. Testes apello Theologos, Antiquarios,\r\n     Jurisconsultos, Bibliopolas; qui quidem omnes, ex Cottoniana\r\n     Bibliotheca, tanquam ex perenni, sed et communi fonte, sine\r\n     impensis et molestiâ, abundè hauserunt.\" _Rer. Anglic.\r\n     Script. Vet._, vol. i., præf., p. 3. The loss of such a\r\n     character--the deprivation of such a patron--made the whole\r\n     society of book-collectors tremble and turn pale. Men began\r\n     to look sharply into their libraries, and to cast a\r\n     distrustful eye upon those who came to consult and to copy:\r\n     for the spirit of COTTON, like the ghost of Hamlet's father,\r\n     was seen to walk, before cock-crow, along the galleries and\r\n     balconies of great collections, and to bid the owners of\r\n     them \"remember and beware\"!--But to return. The library of\r\n     this distinguished bibliomaniac continued under\r\n     sequestration some time after his death, and was preserved\r\n     entire, with difficulty, during the shock of the civil wars.\r\n     In the year 1712, it was removed to Essex House, in\r\n     Essex-street, Strand, where it continued till the year 1730,\r\n     when it was conveyed back to Westminster, and deposited in\r\n     Little Dean's Yard. In October, 1731, broke out that\r\n     dreadful fire, which Hearne (_Benedict. Abbat._, vol. i.,\r\n     præf. p. xvi.) so pathetically deplores; and in which the\r\n     nation so generally sympathized--as it destroyed and\r\n     mutilated many precious volumes of this collection. Out of\r\n     958 volumes, 97 were destroyed, and 105 damaged. In the year\r\n     1753 the library, to the honour of the age, and as the only\r\n     atonement which could be made to the injured name of Cotton,\r\n     as well as to the effectual _laying_ of his perturbed\r\n     spirit--was purchased by parliament, and transported within\r\n     the quiet and congenial abode of the BRITISH MUSEUM: and\r\n     here may it rest, unabused, for revolving ages! The\r\n     collection now contains 26,000 articles. Consult Mr.\r\n     Planta's neatly written preface to the catalogue of the\r\n     same; vide p. 39, 267, ante. And thus take we leave of the\r\n     ever-memorable bibliomaniac, Sir ROBERT COTTON, KNT.]\r\n\r\nEqually celebrated for literary zeal, and yet more for bibliomaniacal\r\nenthusiasm, was the famous SIR THOMAS BODLEY; whose account of\r\nhimself, in _Prince's Worthies of Devon_, and particularly in one of\r\n_Hearne's publications_,[335] can never be read without transport by\r\nan affectionate son of our Oxford _Alma Mater_. View this illustrious\r\nbibliomaniac, with his gentleman-like air, and expressive countenance,\r\nsuperintending, with the zeal of a Custom-house officer, the shipping,\r\nor rather _barging_, of his books for the grand library which is now\r\ncalled by his OWN NAME! Think upon his activity in writing to almost\r\nevery distinguished character of the realm: soliciting, urging,\r\narguing, entreating for their support towards his magnificent\r\nestablishment; and, moreover, superintending the erection of the\r\nbuilding, as well as examining the timbers, with the nicety of a\r\nmaster-carpenter!--Think of this; and when you walk under the grave\r\nand appropriately-ornamented roof, which tells you that you are within\r\nthe precincts of the BODLEIAN LIBRARY, pay obeisance to the portrait\r\nof the founder, and hold converse with his gentle spirit that dwells\r\ntherein!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 335: There are few subjects--to the bibliomaniac\r\n     in general--and particularly to one, who, like the author of\r\n     this work, numbers himself among the dutiful sons of the\r\n     FAIR OXONIAN MOTHER--that can afford a higher gratification\r\n     than the history of the BODLEIAN LIBRARY, which, like\r\n     Virgil's description of fame,\r\n\r\n          \"Soon grew from pigmy to gigantic size.\"\r\n\r\n     The reader is therefore here informed, as a necessary\r\n     preliminary piece of intelligence, that the present note\r\n     will be more monstrous than any preceding one of a similar\r\n     nature. Let him, however, take courage, and only venture to\r\n     dip his feet in the margin of the lake, and I make little\r\n     doubt but that he will joyfully plunge in, and swim across\r\n     it. Of the parentage, birth, and education of Bodley there\r\n     seems to be no necessity for entering into the detail. The\r\n     monument which he has erected to his memory is lofty enough\r\n     for every eye to behold; and thereupon may be read the\r\n     things most deserving of being known. How long the subject\r\n     of his beloved library had occupied his attention it is\r\n     perhaps of equal difficulty and unimportance to know; but\r\n     his determination to carry this noble plan into effect is\r\n     thus pleasingly communicated to us by his own pen: \"when I\r\n     had, I say, in this manner, represented to my thoughts, my\r\n     peculiar estate, I resolved thereupon to possess my soul in\r\n     peace all the residue of my days; to take my full farewell\r\n     of state employments; to satisfy my mind with that\r\n     mediocrity of worldly living that I have of my own, and so\r\n     to retire me from the Court; which was the epilogue and end\r\n     of all my actions and endeavours, of any important note,\r\n     till I came to the age of fifty-three years.\"--\"Examining\r\n     exactly, for the rest of my life, what course I might take;\r\n     and, having, as I thought, sought all the ways to the wood,\r\n     I concluded, at the last, to set up my staff AT THE LIBRARY\r\n     DOOR IN OXON, being thoroughly persuaded, in my solitude and\r\n     surcease from the commonwealth affairs, I could not busy\r\n     myself to better purpose than by reducing that place (which\r\n     then in every part lay ruinated and waste) to the public use\r\n     of Students.\" Prince's _Worthies of Devon_, p. 95, edit.\r\n     1810. Such being the reflections and determination of Sir\r\n     Thomas Bodley, he thus ventured to lay open his mind to the\r\n     heads of the University of Oxford:\r\n\r\n     \"_To the Vice-Chancellor (Dr. Ravis) of Oxon; about\r\n     restoring the public library._\r\n\r\n     (This letter was published in a convocation holden March 2,\r\n     1597)\r\n\r\n     SIR,\r\n\r\n     Although you know me not, as I suppose, yet for the\r\n     farthering an offer, of evident utility, to your whole\r\n     university, I will not be too scrupulous in craving your\r\n     assistance. I have been always of a mind that, if God, of\r\n     his goodness, should make me able to do any thing, for the\r\n     benefit of posterity, I would shew some token of affection,\r\n     that I have ever more borne, to the studies of good\r\n     learning. I know my portion is too slender to perform, for\r\n     the present, any answerable act to my willing disposition:\r\n     but yet, to notify some part of my desire in that behalf, I\r\n     have resolved thus to deal. Where there hath been heretofore\r\n     a public library in Oxford, which, you know, is apparent by\r\n     the room itself remaining, and by your statute records, I\r\n     will take the charge and cost upon me to reduce it again to\r\n     his former use: and to make it fit and handsome, with seats,\r\n     and shelves, and desks, and all that may be needfull, to\r\n     stir up other men's benevolence, to help to furnish it with\r\n     books. And this I purpose to begin, as soon as timber can be\r\n     gotten, to the intent that you may reap some speedy profit\r\n     of my project. And where before, as I conceive, it was to be\r\n     reputed but a store of books of divers benefactors, because\r\n     it never had any lasting allowance, for augmentation of the\r\n     number, or supply of books decayed: whereby it came to pass\r\n     that, when those that were in being were either wasted or\r\n     embezelled, the whole foundation came to ruin:--to meet with\r\n     that inconvenience, I will so provide hereafter (if God do\r\n     not hinder my present design) as you shall be still assured\r\n     of a standing annual rent, to be disbursed every year in\r\n     buying of books, in officers' stipends, and other pertinent\r\n     occasions, with which provision, and some order for the\r\n     preservation of the place, and of the furniture of it, from\r\n     accustomed abuses, it may, perhaps, in time to come, prove a\r\n     notable treasure for the multitude of volumes; an excellent\r\n     benefit for the use and ease of students; and a singular\r\n     ornament in the University. I am, therefore, to intreat you,\r\n     because I will do nothing without their public approbation,\r\n     to deliver this, that I have signified, in that good sort,\r\n     that you think meet: and when you please to let me know\r\n     their acceptation of my offer, I will be ready to effect it\r\n     with all convenient expedition. But, for the better\r\n     effecting of it, I do desire to be informed whether the\r\n     University be sufficiently qualified, by licence of\r\n     Mortmain, or other assurance, to receive a farther grant of\r\n     any rent or annuity than they do presently enjoy. And, if\r\n     any instruments be extant of the ancient donations to their\r\n     former library, I would, with their good liking, see a\r\n     transcript of them: and likewise of such statutes as were\r\n     devised by the founders, or afterwards by others for the\r\n     usage of the books. Which is now as much as I can think on,\r\n     whereunto, at your good leisure, I would request your\r\n     friendly answer. And, if it lie in my ability to deserve\r\n     your pains in that behalf, although we be not yet\r\n     acquainted, you shall find me very forward. From London,\r\n     Feb. 23, 1597.\r\n\r\n     Your affectionate friend,\r\n\r\n     THO. BODLEY.\"\r\n\r\n     In the Easter following, \"Mr. Bodley came to Oxford to view\r\n     the place on which he intended his bounty, and making them a\r\n     model of the design with the help of Mr. Saville, Warden of\r\n     Merton College, ordered that the room, or place of stowage,\r\n     for books, should be new planked, and that benches and\r\n     repositories fo [Transcriber's Note: for] books should be\r\n     set up.\" Wood's _Annals of the University_, vol. ii., pt.\r\n     ii., p. 920. The worthy founder then pursued his epistolary\r\n     intercourse with the Vice-Chancellor:\r\n\r\n     \"_To Mr. Vice Chancellor._\r\n\r\n     SIR,\r\n\r\n     I find myself greatly beholden unto you for the speed that\r\n     you have used in proposing my offer to the whole University,\r\n     which I also hear by divers friends was greatly graced in\r\n     their meeting with your courteous kind speeches. And though\r\n     their answer of acceptance were over thankful and\r\n     respective; yet I take it unto me for a singular comfort,\r\n     that it came for that affection, whose thanks in that behalf\r\n     I do esteem a great deal more than they have reason to\r\n     esteem a far better offer. In which respect I have returned\r\n     my dutiful acknowledgement, which I beseech you to present,\r\n     when you shall call a convocation, about some matter of\r\n     greater moment. Because their letter was in _Latin_,\r\n     methought it did enforce me not to show myself a truant, by\r\n     attempting the like, with a pen out of practice: which yet I\r\n     hope they will excuse with a kind construction of my\r\n     meaning. And to the intent they may perceive that my good\r\n     will is as forward to perform as to promise, and that I\r\n     purpose to shew it to their best contentation, I do hold it\r\n     very requisite that some few should be deputed by the rest\r\n     of the House to consider, for the whole, of the fittest kind\r\n     of facture of desks, and other furniture; and when I shall\r\n     come to Oxford, which I determine, God willing, some time\r\n     before Easter, I will then acquaint the self same parties\r\n     with some notes of a platform, which I and Mr. Savile have\r\n     conceived here between us: so that, meeting altogether, we\r\n     shall soon resolve upon the best, as well for shew, and\r\n     stately form, as for capacity and strength, and commodity of\r\n     students. Of this my motion I would pray you to take some\r\n     notice in particular, for that my letter herewith to your\r\n     public assembly doth refer itself in part to your delivery\r\n     of my mind. My chiefest care is now, the while, how to\r\n     season my timber as soon as possible. For that which I am\r\n     offered by the special favour of Merton College, although it\r\n     were felled a great while since, yet of force it will\r\n     require, after time it is sawed, a convenient seasoning;\r\n     least by making too much haste, if the shelves and seats\r\n     should chance to warp, it might prove to be an eye sore, and\r\n     cost in a manner cast away. To gain some time in that\r\n     regard, I have already taken order for setting sawyers\r\n     a-work, and for procuring besides all other materials;\r\n     wherein my diligence and speed shall bear me witness of my\r\n     willingness to accomplish all that I pretend, to every man's\r\n     good liking. And thus I leave and commend you to God's good\r\n     tuition. From London, March 19, --97\r\n\r\n     Your assured to use in all your occasions,\r\n\r\n     THO.

Confrat. &c., de Reb.\r\n     Glaston._, vol. ii., pp. 612 to 645. We will next peruse the\r\n     curious list of the first benefactors to the Bodleian\r\n     Library.\r\n\r\n     _My Lord of Essex_: about 300 volumes: greater part in\r\n     folio.\r\n\r\n     _My Lord Chamberlain_: 100 volumes, all in a manner new\r\n     bound, with his arms, and a great part in folio.\r\n\r\n     _The Lord Montacute_: 66 costly great volumes, in folio; all\r\n     bought of set purpose, and fairly bound with his arms.\r\n\r\n     _The Lord Lumley_: 40 volumes in folio.\r\n\r\n     _Sir Robert Sidney_: 102 new volumes in folio, to the value\r\n     of one hundred pounds, being all very fair, and especially\r\n     well bound with his arms.\r\n\r\n     _Merton College_: 38 volumes of singular good books in\r\n     folio, &c.\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Philip Scudamor_: 50 volumes: greatest part in folio.\r\n\r\n     _Mr. William Gent_: 100 volumes at the least.\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Lawrence Bodley_: 37 very fair and new bought books in\r\n     folio.

Let us next observe how\r\n     this distinguished bibliomaniac seized every\r\n     opportunity--laying embargoes upon barges and carriages--for\r\n     the conveyance of his book-treasures. The ensuing is also in\r\n     Mr. Gutch's work:\r\n\r\n     \"_To the Right W. Mr. D. King, Dean of Christ-Church, and\r\n     Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxon, or, in his\r\n     absence, to his Deputies there._\r\n\r\n     (Read in Convocation, July 8, 1608.)\r\n\r\n     SIR,\r\n\r\n     I have sent down, by a western barge, all the books that I\r\n     have of this year's collection, which I have requested Mr.\r\n     James, and other of my friends, to see safely brought from\r\n     Burcote, and placed in the library. Sir Francis Vere hath\r\n     sent me this year his accustomed annual gift of ten pounds.\r\n     The Lady Mary Vere, wife to Sir Horace Vere, in the time of\r\n     her widowhood (for so she is desired it should be recorded),\r\n     being called Mrs. Hoby, of Hales, in Gloucestershire, hath\r\n     given twenty pound. (He then enumerates about 15 other\r\n     donations, and thus goes on:) Thus I thought meet to observe\r\n     my yearly custom, in acquainting the University with the\r\n     increase of their store: as my care shall be next, and that\r\n     very shortly, to endow them with that portion of revenue and\r\n     land that I have provided, whensoever God shall call me, for\r\n     the full defraying of any charge that, by present\r\n     likelihood, the conservation of the books, and all needful\r\n     allowances to the keeper and others, may from time to time\r\n     require. I will send you, moreover, a draught of certain\r\n     statutes, which I have rudely conceived about the employment\r\n     of that revenue, and for the government of the library: not\r\n     with any meaning that they should be received, as orders\r\n     made by me (for it shall appear unto you otherwise) but as\r\n     notes and remembrances to abler persons, whom hereafter you\r\n     may nominate (as I will also then request you) to consider\r\n     of those affairs, and so frame a substantial form of\r\n     government, sith that which is a foot is in many thinges\r\n     defective for preservation of the library: for I hold it\r\n     altogether fitting that the University Convocation should be\r\n     always possessed of an absolute power to devise any\r\n     statutes, and of those to alter as they list, when they find\r\n     an occasion of evident utility. But of these and other\r\n     points, when I send you my project, I will both write more\r\n     of purpose, and impart unto you freely my best cogitations,\r\n     being evermore desirous, whatsoever may concern your public\r\n     good, to procure and advance it so, to the uttermost of my\r\n     power: as now in the meanwhile, reminding unto you my\r\n     fervent affection, I rest for any service,\r\n\r\n     Your most assured, at commandment,\r\n\r\n     THO. BODLEIE.\r\n\r\n     London, June 30, 1608.\"\r\n\r\n     In a letter to his \"dearest friends, Doctor Kinge,\r\n     Vice-Chancellor, the Doctors, Proctors, and the rest of the\r\n     Convocation House in Oxon,\" (16th June, 1609) after telling\r\n     them how he had secured certain landed property for the\r\n     payment of the salaries and other expenses attendant upon\r\n     the library, Sir Thomas thus draws to a conclusion: \"Now\r\n     because I presuppose that you take little pleasure in a\r\n     tedious letter, having somewhat besides to impart unto you,\r\n     I have made it known by word to Mr. Vicechancellor, who, I\r\n     know, will not fail to acquaint you with it: as withall I\r\n     have intreated him to supply, in my behalf, all my negligent\r\n     omissions, and defective form of thanks, for all your public\r\n     honours, entertainments, letters, gifts, and other graces\r\n     conferred upon me, which have so far exceeded the compass of\r\n     my merits that, where before I did imagine that nothing\r\n     could augment my zealous inclination to your general good,\r\n     now methinks I do feel it (as I did a great while since) was\r\n     very highly augmented: insomuch as I cannot but shrive\r\n     myself thus freely and soothly unto you. That, albeit, among\r\n     a number of natural imperfections, I have least of all\r\n     offended in the humour of ambition, yet now so it is, that I\r\n     do somewhat repent me of my too much niceness that way: not\r\n     as carried with an appetite to rake more riches to myself\r\n     (wherein, God is my witness, my content is complete) but\r\n     only in respect of my greedy desire to make a livelier\r\n     demonstration of the same that I bear to my COMMON MOTHER,\r\n     than I have hitherto attained sufficient ability to put in\r\n     execution. With which unfeigned testification of my devotion\r\n     unto you, and with my daily fervent prayers for the endless\r\n     prosperity of your joint endeavours, in that whole\r\n     institution of your public library, I will close up this\r\n     letter, and rest, as I shall ever,\r\n\r\n     Yours, in all loving and dutiful affection,\r\n\r\n     THOMAS BODLEY.\r\n\r\n     London, May 31, 1609.\"\r\n\r\n     The following, which is also in Mr. Gutch's publication,\r\n     shews the laudable restlessness, and insatiable ambition, of\r\n     our venerable bibliomaniac, in ransacking foreign libraries\r\n     for the completion of his own.\r\n\r\n     \"_To the Right Worshipfull Mr. D. Singleton, Vicechancellor\r\n     of the University of Oxon._\r\n\r\n     (Read in Convocation, Nov. 9, 1611.)\r\n\r\n     SIR,\r\n\r\n     About some three years past, I made a motion, here in\r\n     London, to Mr. Pindar, Consul of the Company of English\r\n     Merchants at Aleppo (a famous port in the Turk's dominions)\r\n     that he would use his best means to procure me some books in\r\n     the Syriac, Arabic, Turkish, and Persian tongues, or in any\r\n     other language of those Eastern nations: because I make no\r\n     doubt but, in process of time, by the extraordinary\r\n     diligence of some one or other student, they may be readily\r\n     understood, and some special use made of their kind of\r\n     learning in those parts of the world: and where I had a\r\n     purpose to reimburse all the charge that might grow\r\n     thereupon, he sent of late unto me 20 several volumes in the\r\n     foresaid tongues, and of his liberal disposition hath\r\n     bestowed them freely on the library. They are manuscripts\r\n     all (for in those countries they have no kind of printing)\r\n     and were valued in that place at a very high rate. I will\r\n     send them, ere be long, praying you the while to notify so\r\n     much unto the University, and to move them to write a letter\r\n     of thanks, which I will find means to convey to his hands,\r\n     being lately departed from London to Constantinople. Whether\r\n     the letter be indited in Latin or English, it is not much\r\n     material, but yet, in my conceit, it will do best to him in\r\n     English.\"\r\n\r\n     (The remainder of this letter is devoted to a scheme of\r\n     building the public schools at Oxford; in which Sir Thomas\r\n     found a most able and cheerful coadjutor, in one, _Sir Jo.\r\n     Benet_; who seems to have had an extensive and powerful\r\n     connection, and who set the scheme on foot, \"like a true\r\n     affected son to his ANCIENT MOTHER, with a cheerful\r\n     propension to take the charge upon him without groaning.\")\r\n\r\n     In April 1585, Queen Elizabeth granted Sir Thomas \"a\r\n     passport of safe conveyance to Denmark\"; and wrote a letter\r\n     to the King of Denmark of the same date, within two days.\r\n     She wrote, also, a letter to Julius, Duke of Brunswick of\r\n     the same date: in which the evils that were then besetting\r\n     the Christian world abroad were said to be rushing suddenly,\r\n     as \"from the Trojan Horse.\" \"These three letters (observes\r\n     Mr. Baker to his friend Hearne) are only copies, but very\r\n     fairly wrote, and seem to have been duplicates kept by him\r\n     that drew the original letters.\"\r\n\r\n     We will peruse but two more of these Bodleian epistles,\r\n     which Hearne very properly adds as an amusing appendix, as\r\n     well to the foregoing, as to his _Reliquiæ Bodleianæ_ (1703,\r\n     8vo). They are written to men whose names must ever be held\r\n     in high veneration by all worthy bibliomanacs.\r\n\r\n     \"_Sir Tho. Bodley to Sir Robert Cotton._ (_Ex.

Sir\r\n     Kenelm Digby, like a thorough bred bibliomaniac, \"gave fifty\r\n     very good oaks, to purchase a piece of ground of Exeter\r\n     College, laying on the north west side of the library; on\r\n     which, and their own ground adjoining, they might erect the\r\n     future fabric.\" The laying of the foundation of this\r\n     erection is thus described by Wood; concluding with a\r\n     catastrophe, at which I sadly fear the wicked reader will\r\n     smile. \"On the thirteenth of May, being Tuesday, 1634, the\r\n     Vice-chancellor, Doctors, Heads of Houses, and Proctors, met\r\n     at St. Mary's church about 8 of the clock in the morning;\r\n     thence each, having his respective formalities on came to\r\n     this place, and took their seats that were then erected on\r\n     the brim of the foundation. Over against them was built a\r\n     scaffold, where the two proctors, with divers masters,\r\n     stood. After they were all settled, the University\r\n     Musicians, who stood upon the leads at the west end of the\r\n     library, sounded a lesson on their wind music. Which being\r\n     done, the singing men of Christ-Church, with others, sang a\r\n     lesson, after which the senior Proctor, Mr. Herbert Pelham,\r\n     of Magdalen College, made an eloquent oration: that being\r\n     ended also, the music sounded again, and continued playing\r\n     till the Vice-Chancellor went to the bottom of the\r\n     foundation to lay the first stone in one of the south\r\n     angles. But no sooner had he deposited a piece of gold on\r\n     the said stone, according to the usual manner in such\r\n     ceremonies, but the earth fell in from one side of the\r\n     foundation, and the scaffold that was thereon broke and fell\r\n     with it; so that all those that were thereon, to the number\r\n     of a hundred at least, namely, the Proctors, Principals of\r\n     Halls, Masters, and some Bachelaurs, fell down all together,\r\n     one upon another, into the foundation; among whom, the under\r\n     butler of Exeter College had his shoulder broken or put out\r\n     of joint, and a scholar's arm bruised.\" \"The solemnity being\r\n     thus concluded with such a sad catastrophe, the breach was\r\n     soon after made up and the work going chearfully forward,\r\n     was in four years space finished.\" _Annals of the University\r\n     of Oxford_; vol. ii., pt. ii., p. 939.

We\r\n     will take leave of SIR THOMAS BODLEY, and of his noble\r\n     institution, with the subjoined representation of the\r\n     University's Arms--as painted upon the ceiling of the\r\n     library, in innumerable compartments; hoping that the period\r\n     is not very remote when a _History of the Bodleian Library_,\r\n     more ample and complete than any thing which has preceded\r\n     it, will appear prefixed to a _Catalogue of the Books_, like\r\n     unto that which is hinted at p. 74, ante, as \"an urgent\r\n     desideratum.\"\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: DOMINVS ILLVMINATIO MEA]]\r\n\r\nLIS. Alas, you bring to my mind those precious hours that are gone by,\r\nnever to be recalled, which I wasted within this glorious palace of\r\nBodley's erection! How I sauntered, and gazed, and sauntered again.--\r\n\r\nPHIL. Your case is by no means singular. But you promise, when you\r\nrevisit the library, not to behave so naughtily again?\r\n\r\nLIS. I was not then a convert to the BIBLIOMANIA! Now, I will\r\ncertainly devote the leisure of six autumnal weeks to examine\r\nminutely some of the precious tomes which are contained in it.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Very good. And pray favour us with the result of your profound\r\nresearches: as one would like to have the most minute account of the\r\ntreasures contained within those hitherto unnumbered volumes.\r\n\r\nPHIL. As every sweet in this world is balanced by its bitter, I wonder\r\nthat these worthy characters were not lampooned by some sharp-set\r\nscribbler--whose only chance of getting perusers for his work, and\r\nthereby bread for his larder, was by the novelty and impudence of his\r\nattacks. Any thing new and preposterous is sure of drawing attention.\r\nAffirm that you see a man standing upon one leg, on the pinnacle of\r\nSaint Paul's[336]--or that the ghost of Inigo Jones had appeared to\r\nyou, to give you the extraordinary information that Sir Christopher\r\nWren had stolen the whole of the plan of that cathedral from a design\r\nof his own--and do you not think that you would have spectators and\r\nauditors enough around you?\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 336: This is now oftentimes practised by some wag,\r\n     in his \"_Walke in Powles_.\" Whether the same anecdote is\r\n     recorded in the little slim pamphlet published in 1604,\r\n     4to., under the same title--not having the work--(and indeed\r\n     how should I? vide _Bibl. Reed_, no. 2225, _cum\r\n     pretiis_!) I cannot take upon me to determine.]\r\n\r\nLIS. Yes, verily: and I warrant some half-starved scrivener of the\r\nElizabethan period drew his envenomed dart to endeavour to perforate\r\nthe cuticle of some worthy bibliomaniacal wight.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. You may indulge what conjectures you please; but I know of no\r\nanti-bibliomaniacal satirist of this period. STUBBES did what he\r\ncould, in his \"_Anatomy of Abuses_,\"[337] to disturb every social and\r\nharmless amusement of the age. He was the forerunner of that snarling\r\nsatirist, Prynne; but I ought not thus to cuff him, for fear of\r\nbringing upon me the united indignation of a host of black-letter\r\ncritics and philologists. A _large and clean_ copy of his sorrily\r\nprinted work is among the choicest treasures of a Shakspearian\r\nvirtuoso.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 337: \"THE ANATOMIE OF ABUSES: _contayning a\r\n     discoverie, or briefe summarie of such notable vices and\r\n     imperfections as now raigne in many Christian Countreyes of\r\n     the Worlde: but (especiallie) in a very famous Ilande called\r\n     Ailgna_:\" &c. Printed by Richard Jones, 1583, small 8vo.\r\n     Vide Herbert's _Typographical Antiquities_, vol. iii., p.\r\n     1044, for the whole title. Sir John Hawkins, in his _History\r\n     of Music_, vol iii., 419, calls this \"a curious and very\r\n     scarce book;\" and so does my friend, Mr. Utterson; who\r\n     revels in his morocco-coated copy of it--\"_Exemplar olim\r\n     Farmerianum!_\" But let us be candid; and not sacrifice our\r\n     better judgments to our book-passions. After all, Stubbes's\r\n     work is a caricatured drawing. It has strong passages, and a\r\n     few original thoughts; and, is moreover, one of the very few\r\n     works printed in days of yore which have running titles to\r\n     the subjects discussed in them. These may be recommendations\r\n     with the bibliomaniac; but he should be informed that this\r\n     volume contains a great deal of puritanical cant, and\r\n     licentious language; that vices are magnified in it in order\r\n     to be lashed, and virtues diminished that they might not be\r\n     noticed. Stubbes equals Prynne in his anathemas against\r\n     \"Plays and Interludes:\" and in his chapters upon \"Dress\" and\r\n     \"Dancing\" he rakes together every coarse and pungent phrase\r\n     in order to describe \"these horrible sins\" with due\r\n     severity. He is sometimes so indecent that, for the credit\r\n     of the age, and of a virgin reign, we must hope that every\r\n     virtuous dame threw the copy of his book, which came into\r\n     her possession, behind the fire. This may reasonably account\r\n     for its present rarity. I do not discover it in the\r\n     catalogues of the libraries of _Pearson_, _Steevens_, or\r\n     _Brand_; but see _Bibl. Wright_, no. 1390.]\r\n\r\nBut admitting even that Stubbes had drawn his arrow to the head, and\r\ngrazed the skin of such men as Bodley and Cotton, the wound inflicted\r\nby this weapon must have been speedily closed and healed by the\r\nbalsamic medicine administered by ANDREW MAUNSELL, in his _Catalogue\r\nof English Printed Books_.[338] This little thin folio volume afforded\r\na delicious treat to all honest bibliomaniacs. It revived the drooping\r\nspirits of the despondent; and, like the syrup of the renowned Dr.\r\nBrodum, circulated within the system, and put all the generous juices\r\nin action. The niggardly collector felt the influence of rivalship; he\r\nplayed a deeper stake at book-gambling; and hastened, by his painfully\r\nacquired knowledge of what was curious and rare in books, to\r\nanticipate the rustic collector--which latter, putting the best wheels\r\nand horses to his carriage, rushed from the country to the metropolis,\r\nto seize, at Maunsell's shop, a choice copy of _Cranmer's Bible, or\r\nMorley's Canzonets_.[339]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 338: This Catalogue, the first publication of the\r\n     kind ever put forth in this country, is complete in two\r\n     parts; 1595, folio: first part containing 123 pages,\r\n     exclusive of three preliminary epistles: the second, 27\r\n     pages; exclusive of three similar introductory pieces. The\r\n     _first part_ is devoted entirely to Divinity: and in the\r\n     dedicatory epistle to Queen Elizabeth, Maunsell tells her\r\n     majesty that he thought it \"worth his poor labour to collect\r\n     a catalogue of the divine books, so mightily increased in\r\n     her reign; whereby her majesty's most faithful and loving\r\n     subjects may be put in remembrance of the works of so\r\n     excellent authors,\" &c. The second part is devoted to a\r\n     brief account of books in the remaining branches of\r\n     literature, arts, sciences, &c. Maunsell promised to follow\r\n     it up by a _third_ part; but a want of due encouragement\r\n     seems to have damped the bibliographical ardour of the\r\n     compiler; for this third part never appeared: a circumstance\r\n     which, in common with the late Mr. Steevens, all\r\n     bibliomaniacs may \"much lament.\" See the _Athenæum_, vol i.,\r\n     155; also Herbert's _Typographical Antiquities_, vol ii., p.\r\n     1137.

Let us leave him to his _Demonology_; but notice, with the\r\nrespect that it merits, the more rational and even elegantly\r\ncultivated mind of his son PRINCE HENRY;[342] of whose passion for\r\nbooks there are some good evidences upon record. We will next proceed\r\nto the mention of a shrewd scholar and bibliomaniac, and ever active\r\nvoyager, ycleped THOMAS CORYATE, the _Peregrine of Odcombe_. This\r\nfacetious traveller, who was as quaint and original a writer as old\r\nTom Fuller, appears (when he had time and opportunity) to have taken\r\nspecial notice of libraries; and when he describes to us his \"worm\r\neaten\" copy of _Josephus's Antiquities_,[343] \"written in ancient\r\nLongobard characters in parchment,\" one cannot but indulge a natural\r\nwish to know something of the present existence of a MS. which had\r\nprobably escaped Oberthür, the last laborious editor of Josephus.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 340: \"Greatly gyuen to study of bokys:\" _Rastell's\r\n     Chronicle, or Pastyme of People_, p. 28, edit. 1811, 4to.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 341: The passage is somewhere in Burton's _Anatomy\r\n     of Mechanoly_. But I cannot just now, put my finger upon\r\n     it.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 342: The works of KING JAMES I. (of England) were\r\n     published in rather a splendid folio volume in the year\r\n     1616. Amongst these, his _Demonology_ is the \"opus maximum.\"\r\n     Of his son PRINCE HENRY, there is, in this volume, at the\r\n     top of one of the preliminary pieces, a very pretty half\r\n     length portrait; when he was quite a boy. A charming whole\r\n     length portrait of the same accomplished character, when he\r\n     was a young man, engraved by Paas, may be seen in the first\r\n     folio edition of Drayton's _Polyolbion_: but this, the\r\n     reader will tell me, is mere Grangerite information. Proceed\r\n     we, therefore, to a pithy, but powerful, demonstration of\r\n     the bibliomaniacal character of the said Prince Henry. \"In\r\n     the paper office, there is a book, No. 24, containing\r\n     Prince Henry's privy-purse expences, for one year,\" &c.

I possess not only this, but every subsequent copy of it, and a\r\nfair number of copies of his other works. He and BRAITHWAIT were the\r\n\"par nobile fratrum\" of their day.\r\n\r\nPHIL. I have often been struck with some curious passages in Peacham,\r\nrelating to the Education of Youth[344] in our own country; as I\r\nfind, from them, that the complaint of _severity of discipline_ still\r\ncontinued, notwithstanding the able work of Roger Ascham, which had\r\nrecommended a mild and conciliatory mode of treatment.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 344: The HISTORY of the EDUCATION OF YOUTH in this\r\n     country might form an amusing little octavo volume. We have\r\n     _Treatises_ and _Essays_ enough upon the subject; but a\r\n     narrative of its first rude efforts, to its present, yet not\r\n     perfected, form, would be interesting to every parent, and\r\n     observer of human nature. My present researches only enable\r\n     me to go back as far as Trevisa's time, towards the close of\r\n     the 14th century; when I find, from the works of this Vicar\r\n     of Berkeley, that \"every friar that had _state in school_,\r\n     such as they were then, had an HUGE LIBRARY.\" _Harl. MSS._,\r\n     no. 1900. But what the particular system was, among\r\n     youth, which thus so highly favoured the BIBLIOMANIA, I have\r\n     not been able to ascertain. I suspect, however, that\r\n     knowledge made but slow advances; or rather that its\r\n     progress was almost inverted; for, at the end of the\r\n     subsequent century, our worthy printer, Caxton, tells us\r\n     that he found \"but few who could write in their registers\r\n     the occurrences of the day.\" _Polychronicon; prol. Typog.\r\n     Antiquit._, vol. i., 148. In the same printer's prologue to\r\n     _Catho Magnus_ (_Id._, vol. i., 197) there is a melancholy\r\n     complaint about the youth of London; who, although, when\r\n     children, they were \"fair, wise, and prettily bespoken--at\r\n     the full ripening, they had neither kernel nor good corn\r\n     found in them.\" This is not saying much for the academic or\r\n     domestic treatment of young gentlemen, towards the close of\r\n     the 15th century. At the opening of the ensuing century, a\r\n     variety of elementary treatises, relating to the education\r\n     of youth, were published chiefly under the auspices of Dean\r\n     Colet, and composed by a host of learned grammarians, of\r\n     whom honourable mention has been made at page 218, ante.\r\n     These publications are generally adorned with a rude\r\n     wood-cut; which, if it be copied from truth, affords a\r\n     sufficiently striking proof of the severity of the ancient\r\n     discipline: for the master is usually seated in a large\r\n     arm-chair, with a tremendous rod across his knees; and the\r\n     scholars are prostrate before him, either on the ground upon\r\n     bended knees, or sitting upon low benches. Nor was this\r\n     rigid system relaxed in the middle of the same (xvith)\r\n     century; when Roger Ascham composed his incomparable\r\n     treatise, intitled the \"_Schoolmaster_;\" the object of which\r\n     was to decry the same severity of discipline. This able\r\n     writer taught his countrymen the value of making the road to\r\n     knowledge smooth and inviting, by smiles and remunerations,\r\n     rather than by stripes and other punishments. Indeed, such\r\n     was the stern and Draco-like character which schoolmasters\r\n     of this period conceived themselves authorized to assume\r\n     that neither rank, nor situation, nor sex, were exempt from\r\n     the exercise of their tyranny. Lady Jane Grey tells Ascham\r\n     that her former teacher used to give her \"pinches, and\r\n     cuffs, and bobs,\" &c. The preface to the Schoolmaster\r\n     informs us that two gentlemen, who dined with Ascham at\r\n     Cecil's table, were of opinion that NICOLAS UDAL, then head\r\n     master of Eaton School, \"was the best schoolmaster of their\r\n     time, and the _greatest beater_!\" Bishop Latimer, in his\r\n     fourth sermon (edit. 1562, fol. 15 to 18), has drawn such a\r\n     picture of the Londoners of this period that the philosopher\r\n     may imagine that youths, who sprung from such parents,\r\n     required to be ruled with a rod of iron. But it has been the\r\n     fashion of all writers, from the age of St. Austin\r\n     downwards, to depreciate the excellences, and magnify the\r\n     vices, of the times in which they lived. Ludovicus Vives,\r\n     who was Latimer's contemporary, has attacked both\r\n     schoolmasters and youths, in an ungracious style; saying of\r\n     the former that \"some taught Ovid's books of love to their\r\n     scholars, and some make expositions and expounded the\r\n     vices.\" He also calls upon the young women, in the language\r\n     of St. Jerome, \"to avoid, as a mischief or poison of\r\n     chastity, young men with heads bushed and trimmed; and sweet\r\n     smelling skins of outlandish mice.\" _Instruction of a\r\n     Christian Woman_; edit. 1592, sign. D 3, rect. &c. I am not\r\n     aware of any work of importance, relating to the education\r\n     of youth, which appeared till the publication of the\r\n     _Compleat Gentleman_ by HENRY PEACHAM: an author, who richly\r\n     deserves all the handsome things above said of him in the\r\n     text. His chapters \"_Of the Duty of Masters_,\" and \"_Of the\r\n     Duty of Parents_,\" are valuable upon many accounts: inasmuch\r\n     as they afford curious anecdotes of the system of academic\r\n     and domestic education then pursued, and are accompanied\r\n     with his own sagacious and candid reflections. Peacham was\r\n     an _Aschamite_ in respect to lenity of discipline; as the\r\n     following extracts, from the foregoing work, (edit. 1661)\r\n     will unequivocally prove. Peacham first observes upon the\r\n     different modes of education: \"But we see on the contrary,\r\n     out of the master's carterly judgment, like horses in a\r\n     team, the boys are set to draw all alike, when some one or\r\n     two prime and able wits in the school, [Greek: auto\r\n     didaktoi] (which he culs out to admiration if strangers\r\n     come, as a costardmonger his fairest pippins) like fleet\r\n     hovnds go away with the game, when the rest need helping\r\n     over a stile a mile behind: hence, being either quite\r\n     discouraged in themselves, or taken away by their friends\r\n     (who for the most part measure their learning by the form\r\n     they set in), they take leave of their books while they\r\n     live,\" &c. p. 23. \"Some affect, and severer schools enforce,\r\n     a precise and tedious strictness, in long keeping the\r\n     schollers by the walls: as from before six in the morning,\r\n     till twelve or past: so likewise in the afternoon. Which,\r\n     beside the dulling of the wit and dejecting the spirit (for,\r\n     \"otii non minus quam negotii ratio extare debet\") breeds in\r\n     him, afterwards, a kind of hate and carelessness of study\r\n     when he comes to be \"sui juris,\" at his own liberty (as\r\n     experience proves by many, who are sent from severe schools\r\n     unto the universities): withall over-loading his memory, and\r\n     taking off the edge of his invention, with over heavy tasks,\r\n     in themes, verses,\" &c., p. 25. \"Nor is it my meaning that I\r\n     would all masters to be tyed to one method, no more than all\r\n     the shires of England to come up to London by one highway:\r\n     there may be many equally alike good. And since method, as\r\n     one saith, is but [Greek: odopoiêtikê], let every master, if\r\n     he can, by pulling up stiles and hedges, make a more near\r\n     and private way to himself; and in God's name say, with the\r\n     divinest of poets,\r\n\r\n                            _deserta per avia dulcis\r\n          Raptat amor. Juvat ire iugis, quâ nulla priorum_\r\n          CASTALIAM _molli divertitur orbita clivo._\r\n\r\n          (Georg. libi. iij.)\r\n\r\n          With sweet love rapt, I now by deserts pass,\r\n            And over hills where never track of yore:\r\n          Descending easily, yet remembered was,\r\n            That led the way to CASTALIE before.\r\n\r\n          (Peacham.)\r\n\r\n     But instead of many good, they have infinite bad; and go\r\n     stumbling from the right, as if they went blindfold for a\r\n     wager. Hence cometh the shifting of the scholler from master\r\n     to master; who, poor boy (like a hound among a company of\r\n     ignorant hunters hollowing every deer they see), misseth the\r\n     right, begetteth himself new labour, and at last, by one of\r\n     skill and well read, beaten for his paines,\" pp. 29, 30.\r\n     Peacham next notices the extreme severity of discipline\r\n     exercised in some schools. \"I knew one, who in winter would\r\n     ordinarily, in a cold morning, whip his boys over for no\r\n     other purpose than to get himself a heat: another beats them\r\n     for swearing, and all the while sweares himself with\r\n     horrible oaths. He would forgive any fault saving that! I\r\n     had, I remember, myself (neer St. Alban's in Hertfordshire,\r\n     where I was born) a master, who, by no entreaty, would teach\r\n     any scholler he had farther than his father had learned\r\n     before him; as if he had only learned but to read English,\r\n     the son, though he went with him seven years, should go no\r\n     further: his reason was, they would then prove saucy rogues,\r\n     and controle their fathers! Yet these are they that\r\n     oftentimes have our hopefull gentry under their charge and\r\n     tuition, to bring them up in science and civility!\" p. 27.\r\n     This absurd system is well contrasted with the following\r\n     account of the lenity observed in some of the schools on the\r\n     continent: \"In Germany the school is, and as the name\r\n     imports, it ought to be, merely, LUDUS LITERARIUS, a very\r\n     pastime of learning, where it is a rare thing to see a rod\r\n     stirring: yet I heartily wish that our children of England\r\n     were but half so ready in writing and speaking Latin, which\r\n     boys of ten and twelve years old will do so roundly, and\r\n     with so neat a phrase and style, that many of our masters\r\n     would hardly mend them; having only for their punishment,\r\n     shame; and for their reward, praise,\" p. 24. \"Wherefore I\r\n     cannot but commend the custome of their schools in the\r\n     Low-countries, where for the avoyding of this tedious\r\n     sitting still, and with irksome poring on the book all day\r\n     long, after the scholler hath received his lecture, he\r\n     leaveth the school for an houre, and walkes abroad with one\r\n     or two of his fellows, either into the field or up among the\r\n     trees upon the rampire, as in ANTWERP, BREDA, VTRECHT, &c.,\r\n     when they confer and recreate themselves till time calls\r\n     them in to repeat, where perhaps they stay an hour; so\r\n     abroad again, and thus at their pleasure the whole day,\" p.\r\n     26. Thus have we pursued the _History of the Education of\r\n     Boys_ to a period quite modern enough for the most\r\n     superficial antiquary to supply the connecting links down to\r\n     the present times. Nor can we conclude this prolix note\r\n     without observing upon two things which are remarkable\r\n     enough: first, that in a country like our own--the\r\n     distinguishing characteristics of whose inhabitants are\r\n     gravity, reserve, and good sense--lads should conduct\r\n     themselves with so much rudeness, flippancy, and tyranny\r\n     towards each other--and secondly, that masters should, in\r\n     too many instances, exercise a discipline suited rather to a\r\n     government of despotism and terror than to a land of liberty\r\n     and social comfort! But all human improvement, and human\r\n     happiness, is progressive. Speramus meliora!]\r\n\r\nLYSAND. But you must not believe every thing that is said in favour of\r\n_Continental_ lenity of discipline, shewn to youth, if the testimony\r\nof a modern newspaper may be credited!----\r\n\r\nLIS. What your newspaper may hold forth I will not pretend to enter\r\ninto.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Nay, here is the paragraph; which I cut out from \"_The\r\nObserver_,\" and will now read it to you. \"A German Magazine recently\r\nannounced the death of a schoolmaster in Suabia, who, for 51 years,\r\nhad superintended a large institution with old fashioned severity.\r\nFrom an average, inferred by means of recorded observations, one of\r\nthe ushers had calculated that, in the course of his exertions, he had\r\ngiven _911,500 canings, 121,000 floggings, 209,000 custodes, 136,000\r\ntips with the ruler, 10,200 boxes on the ear, and 22,700 tasks by\r\nheart_. It was further calculated that he had made _700 boys stand on\r\npeas, 6000 kneel on a sharp edge of wood, 5000 wear the fool's cap,\r\nand 1,700 hold the rod_. How vast (exclaims the journalist) the\r\nquantity of human misery inflicted by a single perverse educator!\"\r\nNow, my friends, what have you to say against the _English_ system of\r\neducation?\r\n\r\nPHIL. This is only defending bad by worse.\r\n\r\nLIS. Where are we digressing? What are become of our bibliomaniacal\r\nheroes?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. You do right to call me to order. Let us turn from the birch,\r\nto the book, history.\r\n\r\nContemporaneous with Peacham, lived that very curious collector of\r\nancient popular little pieces, as well as lover of \"sacred secret soul\r\nsoliloquies,\" the renowned _melancholy_ composer, ycleped ROBERT\r\nBURTON;[345] who, I do not scruple to number among the most marked\r\nbibliomaniacs of the age; notwithstanding his saucy railing against\r\nFrankfort book-fairs. We have abundance of testimony (exclusive of the\r\nfruits of his researches, which appear by his innumerable marginal\r\nreferences to authors of all ages and characters) that this original,\r\namusing, and now popular, author was an arrant book-hunter; or, as old\r\nAnthony hath it, \"a devourer of authors.\" Rouse, the Librarian of\r\nBodleian, is said to have liberally assisted Burton in furnishing him\r\nwith choice books for the prosecution of his extraordinary work.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 345: I suppose Lysander to allude to a memorandum\r\n     of Hearne, in his _Benedictus Abbas_, p. iv., respecting\r\n     ROBERT BURTON being a collector of \"ancient popular little\r\n     pieces.\" From this authority we find that he gave \"a great\r\n     variety\" of these pieces, with a multitude of books, of the\r\n     best kind, to the \"Bodleian Library.\"--One of these was that\r\n     \"opus incomparabile,\" the \"_History of Tom Thumb_,\" and the\r\n     other, the \"_Pleasant and Merry History of the Mylner of\r\n     Abingdon_.\" The expression \"sacred secret soul soliloquies\"\r\n     belongs to Braithwait: and is thus beautifully interwoven in\r\n     the following harmonious couplets:\r\n\r\n          ----No minute but affords some tears.\r\n          No walks but private solitary groves\r\n          Shut from frequent, his contemplation loves;\r\n          No treatise, nor discourse, so sweetly please\r\n          As sacred-secret soule soliloquies.\r\n\r\n          _Arcadian Princesse_, lib. 4, p. 162.\r\n\r\n     And see, gentle reader, how the charms of solitude--of\r\n     \"walking alone in some solitary grove, betwixt wood and\r\n     water, by a brook-side, to meditate upon some delightsome\r\n     and pleasant subject\" are depicted by the truly original\r\n     pencil of this said Robert Burton, in his _Anatomy of\r\n     Melancholy_, vol. i., p. 126, edit. 1804. But our theme is\r\n     Bibliomania. Take, therefore, concerning the same author,\r\n     the following: and then hesitate, if thou canst, about his\r\n     being infected with the BOOK-DISEASE. \"What a catalogue of\r\n     new books all this year, all this age (I say) have our\r\n     Frank-furt marts, our domestic marts, brought out! Twice a\r\n     year, 'Proferunt se nova ingenia et ostentant;' we stretch\r\n     our wits out! and set them to sale: 'Magno conatu nihil\r\n     agimus,' &c. 'Quis tam avidus librorum helluo,' who can read\r\n     them? As already, we shall have a vast chaos and confusion\r\n     of books; we are oppressed with them; our eyes ake with\r\n     reading, our fingers with turning,\" &c. This is painting _ad\r\n     vivum_--after the life. We see and feel every thing\r\n     described. Truly, none but a thorough master in\r\n     bibliomaniacal mysteries could have thus thought and\r\n     written! See \"_Democritus to the Reader_,\" p. 10; perhaps\r\n     the most highly finished piece of dissection in the whole\r\n     _anatomical work_.]\r\n\r\nAbout this period lived LORD LUMLEY; a nobleman of no mean reputation\r\nas a bibliomaniac. But what shall we say to Lord Shaftesbury's\r\neccentric neighbour, HENRY HASTINGS? who, in spite of his hawks,\r\nhounds, kittens, and oysters,[346] could not for [Transcriber's Note:\r\nextraneous 'for'] forbear to indulge his book propensities though in a\r\nmoderate degree! Let us fancy we see him, in his eightieth year, just\r\nalighted from the toils of the chase, and listening, after dinner,\r\nwith his \"single glass\" of ale by his side, to some old woman with\r\n\"spectacle on nose\" who reads to him a choice passage out of John\r\nFox's _Book of Martyrs_! A rare old boy was this Hastings. But I\r\nwander--and may forget another worthy, and yet more ardent,\r\nbibliomaniac, called JOHN CLUNGEON, who left a press, and some books\r\ncarefully deposited in a stout chest, to the parish church at\r\nSouthampton. We have also evidence of this man's having _erected a\r\npress_ within the same; but human villany has robbed us of every relic\r\nof his books and printing furniture.[347] From Southampton, you must\r\nexcuse me if I take a leap to London; in order to introduce you into\r\nthe wine cellars of one JOHN WARD; where, I suppose, a few choice\r\ncopies of favourite authors were sometimes kept in a secret recess by\r\nthe side of the oldest bottle of hock. We are indebted to Hearne for a\r\nbrief, but not uninteresting, notice of this _vinous_ book\r\ncollector.[348]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 346: Of the bibliomaniacal spirit of LORD LUMLEY\r\n     the reader has already had some slight mention made at pages\r\n     273, 281, ante. Of HENRY HASTINGS, Gilpin has furnished us\r\n     with some anecdotes which deserve to be here recorded. They\r\n     are taken from Hutchin's _Hist. of Dorsetshire_, vol. ii.,\r\n     p. 63. \"Mr. HASTINGS was low of stature, but strong and\r\n     active, of a ruddy complexion, with flaxen hair. His cloaths\r\n     were always of green cloth. His house was of the old\r\n     fashion; in the midst of a large park, well stocked with\r\n     deer, rabbits, and fish-ponds. He had a long narrow bowling\r\n     green in it, and used to play with round sand bowls. Here\r\n     too he had a banquetting room built, like a stand in a large\r\n     tree. He kept all sorts of hounds, that ran buck, fox, hare,\r\n     otter, and badger; and had hawks of all kinds, both long and\r\n     short winged. His great hall was commonly strewed with\r\n     marrow-bones, and full of hawk-perches, hounds, spaniels,\r\n     and terriers. The upper end of it was hung with fox-skins of\r\n     this and the last year's killing. Here and there a pole-cat\r\n     was intermixed, and hunter's poles in great abundance. The\r\n     parlour was a large room, completely furnished in the same\r\n     style. On a broad hearth, paved with brick, lay some of the\r\n     choicest terriers, hounds, and spaniels. One or two of the\r\n     great chairs had litters of cats in them, which were not to\r\n     be disturbed. Of these, three or four always attended him at\r\n     dinner, and a little white wand lay by his trencher, to\r\n     defend it, if they were too troublesome. In the windows,\r\n     which were very large, lay his arrows, cross-bows, and other\r\n     accoutrements. The corners of the room were filled with his\r\n     best hunting and hawking poles. His oyster table stood at\r\n     the lower end of the room, which was in constant use twice a\r\n     day, all the year round; for he never failed to eat oysters\r\n     both at dinner and supper, with which the neighbouring town\r\n     of Pool supplied him. At the upper end of the room stood a\r\n     small table with a double desk; one side of which held a\r\n     CHURCH BIBLE: the other the BOOK OF MARTYRS. On different\r\n     tables in the room lay hawks'-hoods, bells, old hats, with\r\n     their crowns thrust in, full of pheasant eggs, tables, dice,\r\n     cards, and store of tobacco pipes. At one end of this room\r\n     was a door, which opened into a closet, where stood bottles\r\n     of strong beer and wine; which never came out but in single\r\n     glasses, which was the rule of the house, for he never\r\n     exceeded himself, nor permitted others to exceed. Answering\r\n     to this closet was a door into an old chapel; which had been\r\n     long disused for devotion; but in the pulpit, as the safest\r\n     place, was always to be found a cold chine of beef, a\r\n     venison pasty, a gammon of bacon, or a great apple-pye, with\r\n     thick crust, well baked. His table cost him not much, though\r\n     it was good to eat at. His sports supplied all but beef and\r\n     mutton, except on Fridays, when he had the best of fish. He\r\n     never wanted a London pudding, and he always sang it in with\r\n     \"_My part lies therein-a_.\" He drank a glass or two of wine\r\n     at meals; put syrup of gilly-flowers into his sack, and had\r\n     always a tun glass of small beer standing by him, which he\r\n     often stirred about with rosemary. He lived to be an\r\n     hundred, and never lost his eyesight, nor used spectacles.\r\n     He got on horseback without help, and rode to the death of\r\n     the stag till he was past fourscore.\" Gilpin's _Forest\r\n     Scenery_, vol. ii., pp. 23, 26. I should add, from the same\r\n     authority, that Hastings was a neighbour of Anthony Ashley\r\n     Cooper, Earl of Shaftesbury, with whom (as was likely\r\n     enough) he had no cordial agreement.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 347: \"In the northern chapel which is parted from\r\n     the side aile by a beautiful open Gothic screen, is a\r\n     handsome monument to the memory of the lord Chancellor\r\n     Wriothesly, and a _large and costly standing chest_, carved\r\n     and inlaid, and stated, by an inscription on its front, to\r\n     have been given, _with the books in it_, by JOHN CLUNGEON.\r\n     The inscription is as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"John, the sonne of John Clungeon of this towne, Alderman,\r\n     _erected this presse_ and gave certain books, who died, anno\r\n     1646.\r\n\r\n     \"The books are, however, now gone, and the surplices, &c.\r\n     are kept in the chest.\" See a tasteful and elegantly printed\r\n     little volume, entitled \"_A Walk through Southampton_;\" by\r\n     Sir H.C.

If Master Cox, \"by profession a mason,\" and living in the\r\ncountry, could have collected such a cabinet of romances and\r\nballads--why should not a wine merchant, living in the metropolis,\r\nhave turned his attention to a similar pursuit, and have been even\r\nmore successful in the objects of it?\r\n\r\nPHIL. I know not; particularly as we have, at the present day, some\r\ncommercial characters--whose dealings in trade are as opposite to\r\nbooks as frogs are to roast beef--absolute madmen in search after\r\nblack-letter, large paper, and uncut copies! But proceed, Lysander.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Such was the influence of the _Book Mania_ about, or rather a\r\nlittle before, this period that even the sacred retirement of a\r\nmonastery, established upon Protestant principles, and conducted by\r\nrules so rigid as almost to frighten the hardiest ascetic, even such a\r\nspot was unable to resist the charms of book-collecting and\r\nbook-embellishment. How St. Jerome or St. Austin would have lashed the\r\nFERRAR FAMILY[349] for the gorgeous decorations of their volumes, and\r\nfor devoting so much precious time and painful attention to the art\r\nand mystery of Book-binding! Yes, Lisardo; it is truly curious to\r\nthink upon the _Little Gidding Monastery_--near which, perhaps, were\r\n\r\n     ----\"rugged rocks, that holy knees had worn--\"\r\n\r\nand to imagine that the occupiers of such a place were infected--nay,\r\ninflamed--with a most powerful ardour for curious, neat, splendid,\r\nand, I dare venture to affirm, matchless copies of the several volumes\r\nwhich they composed! But I will now hasten to give very different\r\nevidence of the progress of this disease, by noticing the labours of a\r\nbibliomaniac of first rate celebrity; I mean ELIAS ASHMOLE:[350] whose\r\nmuseum at Oxford abundantly proves his curious and pertinacious\r\nspirit in book-collecting. His works, put forth under his own\r\nsuperintendence, with his name subjoined, shew a delicate taste, an\r\nactive research, and, if we except his _Hermetical_ propensities, a\r\nfortunate termination. His \"opus maximum\" is the _Order of the\r\nGarter_; a volume of great elegance both in the composition and\r\ndecorations. Your copy of it, I perceived, was upon _large paper_; and\r\ncost you--\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 349: It remains here to make good the above\r\n     serious charges brought against the ancient and worthy\r\n     family of the FERRARS; and this it is fully in my power to\r\n     do, from the effectual aid afforded me by Dr. Wordsworth, in\r\n     the fifth volume of his _Ecclesiastical Biography_; where\r\n     the better part of Dr. Peckard's Life of Nicholas Ferrar is\r\n     published, together with some valuable and original addenda\r\n     from the archiepiscopal library at Lambeth. Be it, however,\r\n     known to Dr. Wordsworth, and the reviewer of the\r\n     Ecclesiastical Biography in the _Quarterly Review_, vol.\r\n     iv., pp. 93, 103, that Hearne had previously published a\r\n     copious and curious account of the monastery at Little\r\n     Gidding in the supplement to his _Thom. Caii. Vind.\r\n     Antiquit. Oxon._, 1730, 8vo., vol. ii.: which, as far as I\r\n     have had an opportunity of examining Dr. Wordsworth's\r\n     account, does not appear to have been known to this latter\r\n     editor. We will now proceed to the bibliomaniacal anecdotes\r\n     of NICHOLAS FERRAR, SENIOR AND JUNIOR. \"Amongst other\r\n     articles of instruction and amusement, Mr. FERRAR (senior)\r\n     entertained an ingenious _Book-binder_ who taught the\r\n     family, females as well as males, the whole art and skill of\r\n     _book-binding_, gilding, lettering, and what they called\r\n     pasting-printing, by the use of the rolling press. By this\r\n     assistance he composed a full harmony, or concordance, of\r\n     the four evangelists, _adorned with many beautiful\r\n     pictures_, which required more than a year for the\r\n     composition, and was divided into 150 heads or chapters.\"\r\n     There is then a minute account of the mechanical process (in\r\n     which the nieces assisted) how, by means of \"great store of\r\n     the best and strongest white paper, nice knives and\r\n     scissars, pasting and rolling-press\" work--the arduous task\r\n     was at length accomplished: and Mary Collet, one of Mr.\r\n     Ferrar's nieces, put the grand finishing stroke to the\r\n     whole, by \"doing a deed\"--which has snapt asunder the\r\n     threads of Penelope's web for envy:--\"She bound the book\r\n     entirely, ALL WROUGHT IN GOLD, in a new and most elegant\r\n     fashion.\" The fame of this book, or concordance, as it was\r\n     called, reached the ears of Charles I., who \"intreated\"\r\n     (such was his Majesty's expression) to be favoured with a\r\n     sight of it. Laud and Cousins, who were then chaplains in\r\n     waiting, presented it to the King; who \"after long and\r\n     serious looking it over, said, 'This is indeed a most\r\n     valuable work, and in many respects to be presented to the\r\n     greatest prince upon earth: for the matter it contains is\r\n     the richest of all treasures. The laborious composure of it\r\n     into this excellent form of _an Harmony_, the judicious\r\n     contrivance of the method, the curious workmanship in so\r\n     neatly cutting out and disposing the text, _the nice laying\r\n     of these costly pictures, and the exquisite art expressed in\r\n     the binding_, are, I really think, not to be equalled. I\r\n     must acknowledge myself to be, indeed, greatly indebted to\r\n     the family for THIS JEWEL: and whatever is in my power I\r\n     shall, at any time, be ready to do for any of them.'\"\r\n     _Eccles. Biogr._, vol. v., 172-8. This was spoken, by\r\n     Charles, in the true spirit of a Book-Knight! Cromwell, I\r\n     suppose, would have shewn the same mercy to this treasure as\r\n     he did to the madonnas of Raffaelle--thrown it behind the\r\n     fire, as idolatrous! The nephew emulated and eclipsed the\r\n     bibliomaniacal celebrity of his uncle. At the age of\r\n     twenty-one, he executed three books (or \"works\" as they are\r\n     called) of uncommon curiosity and splendour. Archbishop\r\n     Laud, who had a keen eye and solid judgment for things of\r\n     this sort (as the reader will find in the following pages)\r\n     undertook to introduce young Ferrars to the King. The\r\n     introduction is told in such a pleasing style of _naiveté_,\r\n     and the manual dexterity of the young bibliomaniac is so\r\n     smartly commended by Charles, that I cannot find it in my\r\n     heart to abridge much of the narrative. \"When the king saw\r\n     the Archbishop enter the room, he said, 'What have you\r\n     brought with you those _rarities_ and _jewels_ you told me\r\n     of?' 'Yea, sire,' replied the bishop; 'here is the YOUNG\r\n     GENTLEMAN and his works.' So the bishop, taking him by the\r\n     hand, led him up to the king. He, falling down on his knees,\r\n     the king gave him his hand to kiss, bidding him rise up. The\r\n     box was opened, and NICHOLAS FERRAR, first presented to the\r\n     king that book made for the prince; who taking it from him,\r\n     looking well on the outside, which was _all green velvet,\r\n     stately and richly gilt all over, with great broad strings,\r\n     edged with gold lace, and curiously bound_, said, 'Here is a\r\n     fine book for Charles, indeed! I hope it will soon make him\r\n     in love with what is within it, for I know it is good,' &c.\r\n     And lo! here are also store of _rare pictures_ to delight\r\n     his eye with! &c., &c. Then, turning him to the Lord of\r\n     Canterbury, he said, 'Let this young gentleman have your\r\n     letters to the princes to-morrow, to Richmond, and let him\r\n     carry this present. It is a good day, you know, and a good\r\n     work would be done upon it.' So he gave Nicholas Ferrar the\r\n     book; who, carrying it to the box, took out of it a very\r\n     large paper book, which was the FOURTH WORK, and laid it on\r\n     the table before the king. 'For whom,' said the king, 'is\r\n     this model?' 'For your majesty's eyes, if you please to\r\n     honour it so much.' 'And that I will gladly do,' said the\r\n     king, 'and never be weary of such sights as I know you will\r\n     offer unto me.' The king having well perused the title page,\r\n     beginning, 'The Gospel of our Lord and blessed Saviour,\r\n     Jesus Christ, in eight several languages,' &c., said unto\r\n     the lords, 'You all see that one good thing produceth\r\n     another. Here we have more and more rarities; from print now\r\n     to pen. These are fair hands, well written, and as well\r\n     composed.' Then replied the Lord of Canterbury, 'When your\r\n     majesty hath seen all, you will have more and more cause to\r\n     admire.' 'What!' said the king, 'is it possible we shall\r\n     behold yet more rarities?' then said the bishop to Nicholas\r\n     Ferrar, 'Reach the other piece that is in the box:' and this\r\n     we call the FIFTH WORK; the title being _Novum Testamentum,\r\n     &c., in viginti quatuor linguis, &c._ The king, opening the\r\n     book, said, 'Better and better. This is the largest and\r\n     fairest paper that ever I saw.' Then, reading the\r\n     title-page, he said, 'What is this? What have we here? The\r\n     incomparablest book this will be, as ever eye beheld. My\r\n     lords, come, look well upon it. This finished, must be the\r\n     EMPEROR OF ALL BOOKS. It is the crown of all works. It is an\r\n     admirable masterpiece. The world cannot match it. I believe\r\n     you are all of my opinion.' The lords all seconded the king,\r\n     and each spake his mind of it. 'I observe two things amongst\r\n     others,' said the king, 'very remarkable, if not admirable.\r\n     The first is, how is it possible that a young man of\r\n     twenty-one years of age (for he had asked the Lord of\r\n     Canterbury before, how old Nicholas Ferrar was) should ever\r\n     attain to the understanding and knowledge of more languages\r\n     than he is of years; and to have the courage to venture upon\r\n     such an Atlas work, or Hercules labour. The other is also of\r\n     high commendation, to see him write so many several\r\n     languages, so well as these are, each in its proper\r\n     character. Sure so few years had been well spent, some men\r\n     might think, to have attained only to the _writing_ thus\r\n     fairly, of these twenty-four languages!' All the lords\r\n     replied his majesty had judged right; and said, except they\r\n     had seen, as they did, the young gentleman there, and the\r\n     book itself, all the world should not have persuaded them to\r\n     the belief of it.\" _Ecclesiastical Biography_, vol. v., pp.\r\n     216, 220. But whatever degree of credit or fame of young\r\n     FERRARS might suppose to have been attached to the execution\r\n     of these \"pieces,\" his emulation was not damped, nor did his\r\n     industry slacken, 'till he had produced a specimen of much\r\n     greater powers of book-decoration. His appetite was that of\r\n     a giant; for he was not satisfied with any thing short of\r\n     bringing forth a volume of such dimensions as to make the\r\n     bearer of it groan beneath its weight--and the beholders of\r\n     it dazzled with its lustre, and astonished at its amplitude.\r\n     Perhaps there is not a more curious book-anecdote upon\r\n     record than the following. \"Charles the 1st, his son\r\n     Charles, the Palsgrave, and the Duke of Lennox, paid a visit\r\n     to the monastery of Little Gidding, in Huntingdonshire--the\r\n     abode of the Ferrars.\"--\"Then, the king was pleased to go\r\n     into the house, and demanded where the GREAT BOOK was, that\r\n     he had heard was made for Charles's use. It was soon brought\r\n     unto him; and the _largeness_ and _weight_ of it was such\r\n     that he that carried it seemed to be _well laden_. Which the\r\n     duke, observing, said, 'Sir, one of your strongest guard\r\n     will but be able to carry this book.' It being laid on the\r\n     table before the king, it was told him that, though it were\r\n     then fairly bound up in _purple velvet_, that the outside\r\n     was not fully finished, as it should be, for the prince's\r\n     use and better liking. 'Well,' said the king, 'it is very\r\n     well done.' So he opened the book, the prince standing at\r\n     the table's end, and the Palsgrave and Duke on each side of\r\n     the king. The king read the title page and frontispice all\r\n     over very deliberately; and well viewing the form of it, how\r\n     adorned with _a stately garnish of pictures, &c._, and the\r\n     curiousness of the writing of it, said, 'Charles, here is a\r\n     book that contains excellent things. This will make you both\r\n     wise and good.' Then he proceeded to turn it over, leaf by\r\n     leaf, and took exact notice of all in it: and it being _full\r\n     of pictures of sundry mens cuts_, he could tell the\r\n     palsgrave, who seemed also to be knowing in that kind, that\r\n     this and this, and that and that, were of such a man's\r\n     graving and invention. The prince all the while greatly eyed\r\n     all things; and seemed much to be pleased with the book. The\r\n     king having spent some hours in the perusal of it, and\r\n     demanding many questions was occasion as, concerning the\r\n     contrivement, and having received answers to all he\r\n     demanded, at length said, 'It was only _a jewel for a\r\n     Prince_, and hoped CHARLES would make good use of it: and I\r\n     see and find, by what I have myself received formerly from\r\n     this good house, that they go on daily in the prosecution of\r\n     these excellent pieces. They are brave employments of their\r\n     time.' The Palsgrave said to the prince, 'Sir, your father\r\n     the king is master of the goodliest ship in the world, and I\r\n     may now say you will be master of the GALLANTEST GREATEST\r\n     BOOK in the world: for I never saw _such paper_ before; and\r\n     believe there is no book of this largeness to be seen in\r\n     Christendom.' 'The paper and the book in all conditions,'\r\n     said the king, 'I believe it not to be matched. Here hath\r\n     also in this book not wanted, you see, skill, care, nor\r\n     cost.' 'It is a most admirable piece,' replied the Duke of\r\n     Richmond. So the king, closing the book, said, 'Charles,\r\n     this is yours.' He replied, 'But, Sir, shall I not now have\r\n     it with me?' Reply was made by one of the family, 'If it\r\n     please your highness, the book is not _on the outside so\r\n     finished_ as it is intended for you, but shall be, with all\r\n     expedition, done, and you shall have it.' 'Well,' said the\r\n     king, 'you must content yourself for a\r\n     while.'\"--_Ecclesiastical Biography_, vol. v., p. 237.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 350: In the year 1774, was published an octavo\r\n     volume, containing the lives of WILLIAM LILLY the\r\n     astrologer, and ELIAS ASHMOLE the antiquary: two of the\r\n     greatest _cronies_ of their day. The particulars of\r\n     Ashmole's life are drawn from his own _Diary_, in which is\r\n     detailed every thing the most minute and ridiculous; while\r\n     many of the leading features in his character, and many\r\n     interesting occurrences in his life, are wholly suppressed.\r\n     The editor has not evinced much judgment in causing\r\n     posterity to be informed when Ashmole's \"_great and little\r\n     teeth ached, or were loose_:\" when his \"_neck break forth,\r\n     occasioned by shaving his beard with a bad razor_\" (p. 312);\r\n     when \"_his maid's bed was on fire, but he rose quickly\r\n     (thanking God) and quenched it_\" (p. 313); and when he\r\n     \"_scratched the right-side of his buttocks, &c., and applied\r\n     pultices thereunto, made of white bread crums, oil of roses,\r\n     and rose leaves_;\" (p. 363--and see particularly the long\r\n     and dismal entries at p. 368.) All this might surely have\r\n     been spared, without much injury to the reputation of the\r\n     sufferer. Yet, in some other minute entries, we glean\r\n     intelligence a little more interesting. At p. 324, we find\r\n     that Ashmole had quarrelled with his wife; and that \"Mr.\r\n     Serjeant Maynard observed to the Court that there were 800\r\n     sheets of depositions on his wife's part, and not one word\r\n     proved against him of using her ill, or ever giving her a\r\n     bad or provoking word:\" at page 330, we find Ashmole\r\n     accompanying his heraldic friend Dugdale, in his\r\n     \"visitations\" of counties; also that \"his picture was drawn\r\n     by Le Neve in his herald's coat:\" Loggan afterwards drew it\r\n     in black lead: p. 352. But here again (p. 353) we are\r\n     gravely informed that \"_his tooth, next his fore tooth in\r\n     his upper jaw, was very loose, and he easily pulled it out,\r\n     and that one of his middle teeth in his lower jaw, broke out\r\n     while he was at dinner_.\" He sat (for the last time) for \"a\r\n     second picture to Mr. Ryley,\" p. 379. Ashmole's intimacy\r\n     with Lilly was the foundation of the former's (supposed)\r\n     profundity in alchemical and astrological studies. In this\r\n     Diary we are carefully told that \"Mr. Jonas Moore brought\r\n     and acquainted him with Mr. William Lilly, on a Friday\r\n     night, on the 20th of November,\" p. 302. Ashmole was then\r\n     only 26 years of age; and it will be readily conceived how,\r\n     at this susceptible period, he listened with rapture to his\r\n     master's exposition of the black art, and implicitly adopted\r\n     the recipes and maxims he heard delivered. Hence the pupil\r\n     generally styled himself _Mercuriophilus Anglicus_, at the\r\n     foot of most of his title-pages: and hence we find such\r\n     extraordinary entries, in the foresaid diary, as the\r\n     following: \"This night (August 14, 1651) about one of the\r\n     clock, I fell ill of a surfeit, occasioned by drinking\r\n     _water after Venison_. I was greatly oppressed in my\r\n     stomach; and next day Mr. Saunders, _the astrologian_, sent\r\n     me a piece of briony-root to hold in my hand; and within a\r\n     quarter of an hour my stomach was freed from that great\r\n     oppression,\" p. 314. \"Sep. 27, 1652, I came to Mr. John\r\n     Tompson's, who dwelt near Dove Bridge; he used a call, and\r\n     had responses in a soft voice,\" p. 317. At p. 318 is\r\n     narrated the commencement of his acquaintance with the\r\n     famous Arise Evans, a Welsh prophet: whose \"_Echo from\r\n     Heaven_,\" &c., 2 parts, 1652, 12mo., is a work noticed by\r\n     Warburton, and coveted by bibliomaniacs. Yet one more\r\n     quack-medicine entry: \"March 11, 1681. I took early in the\r\n     morning a good dose of Elixir, and hung three spiders about\r\n     my neck, and they drove my ague away--Deo gratias!\" p. 359.\r\n     It seems that Ashmole always punctually kept \"_The\r\n     Astrologer's Feast_;\" and that he had such celebrity as a\r\n     curer of certain diseases, that Lord Finch the Chancellor\r\n     \"sent for him to cure him of his rheumatism. He dined there,\r\n     but would not undertake the cure,\" p. 364. This was behaving\r\n     with a tolerable degree of prudence and good sense. But let\r\n     not the bibliomaniac imagine that it is my wish to degrade\r\n     honest old Elias Ashmole, by the foregoing delineation of\r\n     his weaknesses and follies. The ensuing entries, in the said\r\n     Diary, will more than counterbalance any unfavourable effect\r\n     produced by its precursors; and I give them with a full\r\n     conviction that they will be greedily devoured by those who\r\n     have been lucky enough to make good purchases of the entire\r\n     libraries of deceased characters of eminence. In his 37th\r\n     year, Ashmole \"bought of Mr. Milbourn all his books and\r\n     mathematical instruments;\" and the day after (N.B. \"8\r\n     o'clock, 39 min. post merid.\") \"he bought Mr. Hawkins's\r\n     books,\" p. 312. In the ensuing year he \"agreed with Mrs.\r\n     Backhouse, of London, for her deceased husband's books,\" p.\r\n     313. He now became so distinguished as a successful\r\n     bibliomaniac that Seldon and Twysden sought his\r\n     acquaintance; and \"Mr. Tredescant and his wife told him that\r\n     they had been long considering upon whom to bestow their\r\n     _closet of curiosities_, and at last had resolved to give it\r\n     unto him,\" p. 326. Having by this time (A.D. 1658) commenced\r\n     his famous work upon _The Order of the Garter_, he was\r\n     introduced to Charles II.: kissed hands, and was appointed\r\n     by the king \"to make a description of his medals, and had\r\n     them delivered into his hands, and _Henry the VIIIth's\r\n     closet_ assigned for his use,\" p. 327. In this same year\r\n     came forth his \"_Way to Bliss_;\" 4to.: a work so invincibly\r\n     dull that I despair of presenting the reader with any thing\r\n     like entertainment even in the following heterogeneous\r\n     extract: \"When our natural heat, the life of this little\r\n     world, is faint and gone, the body shrinks up and is\r\n     defaced: but bring again heat into the parts, and likewise\r\n     money into the bankrupt's coffers, and they shall be both\r\n     lusty, and flourish again as much as ever they did. But how\r\n     may this heat be brought again? To make few words, even as\r\n     she is kept and held by due _meat_ and _motion_; for if she\r\n     faint, and falleth for want of them only, then give her\r\n     them, and she shall recover herself again. Meat is the bait\r\n     that draws her down: motion comes after, like a _Gad-Bee_,\r\n     to prick her forward; but the work is performed in this\r\n     order. First this meat, which is that fine and æthereal oyl\r\n     often above-described, by the exceeding piercing swifteness,\r\n     divides, scatters, and scowres away the gross and foul dregs\r\n     and leavings which, for want of the tillage of heat, had\r\n     overgrown in our bodies, and which was cast, like a blockish\r\n     stay-fish in the way, to stay the free course of the ship of\r\n     life: these flying out of all sides, abundantly pluck up all\r\n     the old leavings of hair, nails, and teeth, by the roots,\r\n     and drive them out before them: in the mean while, our\r\n     medicine makes not onely clear way and passage for life, if\r\n     she list to stir and run her wonted race (which some think\r\n     enough of this matter), but also scattereth all about her\r\n     due and desired meat, and first moisture to draw her\r\n     forward. By which means our life, having gotten both her\r\n     full strength and liveliness, and returned like the sun in\r\n     summer into all our quarters, begins to work afresh as she\r\n     did at first; (for being the same upon the same, she must\r\n     needs do the same) knitting and binding the weak and loose\r\n     joynts and sinews, watering and concocting all by good\r\n     digestion; and then the idle parts like leaves shall, in\r\n     this hot summer, spring and grow forth afresh, out of this\r\n     new and young temper of the body: and all the whole face and\r\n     shew shall be young again and flourishing,\" pp. 119, 120.\r\n     With such a farrago of sublime nonsense were our worthy\r\n     forefathers called upon to be enlightened and amused! But I\r\n     lose sight of Ashmole's _book-purchases_. That he gave away,\r\n     as well as received, curious volumes, is authenticated by\r\n     his gift of \"five volumes of Mr. Dugdale's works to the\r\n     Temple Library:\" p. 331. \"Again: I presented the public\r\n     library at Oxford with three folio volumes, containing a\r\n     description of the Consular and Imperial coins there, which\r\n     I had formerly made and digested, being all fairly\r\n     transcribed with my own hand,\" p. 332. But mark well: \"My\r\n     first boatful of books, which were carried to Mrs.\r\n     Tredescant's, were brought back to the Temple:\" also, (May\r\n     1667) \"I bought Mr. John Booker's study of books, and gave\r\n     140_l._ for them,\" p. 333. In the same year that his _Order\r\n     of the Garter_ was published, his \"good friend Mr. Wale sent\r\n     him Dr. DEE'S original books and papers,\" p. 339. But he yet\r\n     went on buying: \"Nil actum reputans, dum quid superesset\r\n     agendum:\" for thus journalises our super-eminent\r\n     bibliomaniac:--(June 12, 1681) \"I bought Mr. Lilly's library\r\n     of books of his widow, for fifty pounds,\" p. 360. In August,\r\n     1682, Ashmole went towards Oxford, \"to see the building\r\n     prepared to receive his rarities;\" and in March, 1683, \"the\r\n     last load of his rarities was sent to the barge.\" In July,\r\n     1687, he received a parcel of books from J.W. Irnhoff, of\r\n     Nurembergh, among which was his _Excellentium Familiarum in\r\n     Gallia Genealogia_: p. 379. But it is time to put an end to\r\n     this unwieldly note: reserving the account of Ashmole's\r\n     _Order of the Garter_, and _Theatrum Chemicum_, for the\r\n     ensuing one--and slightly informing the reader, of what he\r\n     may probably be apprized, that our illustrious bibliomaniac\r\n     bequeathed his museum of curiosities and library of books to\r\n     his beloved ALMA MATER OXONIENSIS--having first erected a\r\n     large building for their reception. It is justly said of\r\n     him, in the inscription upon his tombstone,\r\n\r\n          DURANTE MUSÆO ASHMOLEANO OXON.\r\n          NUNQUAM MORITURUS.\r\n\r\n     A summer month might be profitably passed in the Ashmolean\r\n     collection of Books! Let us not despair that a complete\r\n     _Catalogue Raisonné_ of them may yet be given.]\r\n\r\nLOREN. Not eight guineas--although you were about to say _fourteen_!\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Even so. But it must have been obtained in the golden age of\r\nbook-collecting?\r\n\r\nLOREN. It was obtained, together with an uncut copy of his _Theatrum\r\nChemicum_,[351] by my father, at the shop of a most respectable\r\nbookseller, lately living, at Mews-Gate, and now in Pall-Mall--where\r\nthe choicest copies of rare and beautiful books are oftentimes to be\r\nprocured, at a price much less than the extravagant ones given at\r\nbook-sales. You observed it was bound in blue morocco--and by that\r\nCoryphæus of book-binders, the late ROGER PAYNE!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 351: First let us say a few words of the THEATRUM\r\n     CHEMICUM BRITANNICUM, as it was the anterior publication. It\r\n     contains a collection of ancient English poetical pieces\r\n     relating to Alchemy, or the \"Hermetique Mysteries;\" and was\r\n     published in a neat quarto volume, in 1652; accompanied with\r\n     a rich sprinkling of plates \"cut in brass,\" and copious\r\n     annotations, at the end, by Ashmole himself. Of these\r\n     plates, some are precious to the antiquary; for reasons\r\n     which will be given by me in another work. At present, all\r\n     that need be said is that a fine tall copy of it brings a\r\n     fair sum of money. I never heard of the existence of a\r\n     _large paper_ impression. It went to press in July 1651; and\r\n     on the 26th of January following, \"the first copy of it was\r\n     sold to the Earl of Pembroke:\" see the Diary, pp. 313-315.\r\n     In May, 1658, Ashmole made his first visit to the Record\r\n     Office in the Tower, to collect materials for his work of\r\n     \"THE ORDER OF THE GARTER.\" In May following, Hollar\r\n     accompanied the author to Windsor, to take views of the\r\n     castle. In the winter of 1665, Ashmole composed a \"good part\r\n     of the work at Roe-Barnes (the plague increasing).\" In May,\r\n     1672, a copy of it was presented to King Charles II.: and in\r\n     June, the following year, Ashmole received \"his privy-seal\r\n     for 400_l._ out of the custom of paper, which the king was\r\n     pleased to bestow upon him for the same.\" This, it must be\r\n     confessed, was a liberal remuneration. But the author's\r\n     honours increased and multiplied beyond his most sanguine\r\n     expectations. Princes and noblemen, abroad and at home, read\r\n     and admired his work; and Ashmole had golden chains placed\r\n     round his neck, and other superb presents from the greater\r\n     part of them; one of which (from the Elector of\r\n     Brandenburgh) is described as being \"composed of ninety\r\n     links, of philagreen links in great knobs, most curious\r\n     work,\" &c. In short, such was the golden harvest which\r\n     showered down upon him on all sides, on account of this\r\n     splendid publication, that \"he made a feast at his house in\r\n     South Lambeth, in honour to his benefactors of the work of\r\n     THE GARTER.\" I hope he had the conscience to make HOLLAR his\r\n     Vice-President, or to seat him at his right hand; for this\r\n     artist's _Engravings_, much more than the author's\r\n     composition, will immortalize the volume. Yet the\r\n     artist--died in penury! These particulars relating to this\r\n     popular work, which it was thought might be amusing to the\r\n     lover of fine books, have been faithfully extracted from the\r\n     'forementioned original and amusing Diary. _The Order of the\r\n     Garter_ was originally sold for 1_l._ 10_s._ See _Clavel's\r\n     Catalogue_, 1675, p. 31.]\r\n\r\nLYSAND. I observed it had a \"glorious aspect,\" as bibliographers term\r\nit.\r\n\r\nLIS. But what has become of Ashmole all this while?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. I will only further remark of him that, if he had not suffered\r\nhis mind to wander in quest of the puzzling speculations of alchemy\r\nand astrology--which he conceived himself bound to do in consequence,\r\nprobably, of wearing John Dee's red velvet night cap--he might have\r\nmingled a larger portion of common sense and sound practical\r\nobservations in his writings.\r\n\r\nBut a truce to worthy old Elias. For see yonder the bibliomaniacal\r\nspirit of ARCHBISHOP LAUD pacing your library! With one hand resting\r\nupon a folio,[352] it points, with the other, to your favourite print\r\nof the public buildings of the University of Oxford--thereby reminding\r\nus of his attachment, while living, to literature and fine books, and\r\nof his benefactions to the Bodleian Library. Now it \"looks frowningly\"\r\nupon us; and, turning round, and shewing the yet reeking gash from\r\nwhich the life-blood flowed, it flits away--\r\n\r\n     Par levibus ventis, volucrique simillima somno!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 352: ARCHBISHOP LAUD, who has [Transcriber's Note:\r\n     was] beheaded in the year 1644, had a great fondness for\r\n     sumptuous decoration in dress, books, and ecclesiastical\r\n     establishments; which made him suspected of a leaning\r\n     towards the Roman Catholic religion. His life has been\r\n     written by Dr. Heylin, in a heavy folio volume of 547 pages;\r\n     and in which we have a sufficiently prolix account of the\r\n     political occurrences during Laud's primacy, but rather a\r\n     sparing, or indeed no, account of his private life and\r\n     traits of domestic character. In Lloyd's _Memoirs of the\r\n     Sufferers_ from the year 1637 to 1660 inclusive (1668, fol.)\r\n     are exhibited the articles of impeachment against the\r\n     Archbishop; and, amongst them, are the following\r\n     bibliomaniacal accusations. \"Art. 5. Receiving a _Bible_,\r\n     with a crucifix embroidered on the cover of it by a lady.\r\n     Art. 6. A book of popish pictures, _two Missals_,\r\n     Pontificals, and Breviaries, which he made use of as a\r\n     scholar. Art. 7. His (own) admirable _Book of Devotion_,\r\n     digested according to the ancient way of canonical hours,\r\n     &c. Art. 19. _The book of Sports_, which was published first\r\n     in King James his reign, before he had any power in the\r\n     church; and afterward in King Charles his reign, before he\r\n     had the chief power in the church,\" &c., pp. 235-237. But if\r\n     Laud's head was doomed to be severed from his body in\r\n     consequence of these his bibliomaniacal frailties, what\r\n     would have been said to the fine copy of one of the\r\n     _Salisbury Primers or Missals_, printed by Pynson UPON\r\n     VELLUM, which once belonged to this archbishop, and is now\r\n     in the library of St. John's College, Oxford?! Has the\r\n     reader ever seen the same primate's copy of the _Aldine\r\n     Aristophanes_, 1498, in the same place? 'Tis a glorious\r\n     volume; and I think nearly equals my friend Mr. Heber's\r\n     copy, once Lord Halifax's, of the same edition. Of Laud's\r\n     benefactions to the Bodleian Library, the bibliographer will\r\n     see ample mention made in the _Catalogus Librorum\r\n     Manuscriptorum Angliæ, Hiberniæ_, &c., 1697, folio. The\r\n     following, from Heylin, is worth extracting: \"Being come\r\n     near the block, he (Laud) put off his doublet, &c., and\r\n     seeing through the chink of the boards that some people were\r\n     got under the scaffold, about the very place where the block\r\n     was seated, he called to the officer for some dust to stop\r\n     them, or to remove the people thence; saying, it was no part\r\n     of his desire 'that his blood should fall upon the heads of\r\n     the people.' Never did man put off mortality with a better\r\n     courage, nor look upon his bloody and malicious enemies with\r\n     more christian charity.\" _Cyprianus Anglicus_; or the _Life\r\n     and Death of Laud_; 1668, fol.; p. 536. In the Master's\r\n     library at St. John's, Oxford, they shew the velvet cap\r\n     which it is said Laud wore at his execution; and in which\r\n     the mark of the axe is sufficiently visible. The archbishop\r\n     was a great benefactor to this college. Mr. H. Ellis, of the\r\n     Museum, who with myself were \"quondam socii\" of the same\r\n     establishment, writes me, that \"Among what are called the\r\n     king's pamphlets in the British Museum, is a fragment of a\r\n     tract, without title, of fifty-six pages only, imperfect;\r\n     beginning, 'A briefe examination of a certaine pamphlet\r\n     lately printed in Scotland, and intituled _Ladensium\r\n     Autocatacrisis_,' &c., 'The Cantabarians Self-Conviction.'\r\n     On the blank leaf prefixed, is the following remark in a\r\n     hand of the time. 'This Briefe Examen following, was found\r\n     in the Archbishop's (Laud?) Library, wher the whole\r\n     impression of these seauen sheets was found, but nether\r\n     beginning nor ending more then is hearein contained. May\r\n     11th, 1644.' This work, (continues Mr. Ellis,) which is a\r\n     singular and valuable curiosity, is in fact a personal\r\n     vindication of Archbishop Laud, not only from the slanders\r\n     of the pamphlet, but from those of the times in general: and\r\n     from internal evidence could have been written by no one but\r\n     himself. It is in a style of writing beyond that of the\r\n     ordinary productions of the day.\"]\r\n\r\nPeace, peace, thou once \"lofty spirit\"--peace to thy sepulchre--always\r\nconsecrated by the grateful student who has been benefited by thy\r\nbounty!\r\n\r\nPerhaps Laud should have been noticed a little earlier in this list of\r\nbibliomanical heroes; but, having here noticed him, I cannot refrain\r\nfrom observing to you that the notorious HUGH PETERS revelled in some\r\nof the spoils of the archbishop's library; and that there are, to the\r\nbest of my recollection, some curious entries on the journals of the\r\nHouse of Commons relating to the same.[353]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 353: I am indebted to the same literary friend who\r\n     gave me the intelligence which closes the last note, for the\r\n     ensuing particulars relating to HUGH PETERS; which are taken\r\n     from the journals of the lower house: \"Ao. 1643-4. March 8.\r\n     Ordered, that a study of books, to the value of 100_l._ out\r\n     of such books as are sequestered, be forthwith bestowed upon\r\n     Mr. PETERS.\" _Journals of the House of Commons_, vol. ii.,\r\n     p. 421. \"Ao. 1644. 25 April. Whereas this House was formerly\r\n     pleased to bestow upon Mr. Peters books to the value of\r\n     100_l._, it is this day ordered that Mr. Recorder, Mr.\r\n     Whitlock, Mr. Hill, or two of them, do cause to be delivered\r\n     to Mr. Peters, to the value of 100_l._, books out of the\r\n     private and particular study of the ARCHBISHOP OF\r\n     CANTERBURY.\" _Id._, vol. iii., p. 469. \"Ao. 1644. 26 Junij.\r\n     Dies publicæ Humiliationis. Mr. Peters made a large and full\r\n     relation of the state of the western counties, and of the\r\n     proceedings of my Lord General's army, since its coming\r\n     thither,\" &c. \"Whereas, formerly, books to the amount of\r\n     100_l._ were bestowed upon Mr. Peters out of the\r\n     archbishop's private library, and whereas the said study is\r\n     appraised at above 40_l._ more than the 100_l._, it is\r\n     ordered this day that Mr. Peters shall have the whole study\r\n     of books freely bestowed upon him.\" _Id._ p. 544. \"Ao. 1660.\r\n     May 16.

This is extraordinary enough. But, if I well remember, you\r\nmentioned, a short time ago, the name of BRAITHWAIT as connected with\r\nthat of Peacham. Now, as I persume [Transcriber's Note: presume]\r\nLorenzo has not tied down his guests to any rigid chronological rules,\r\nin their literary chit-chat, so I presume you might revert to\r\nBraithwait, without being taxed with any great violation of colloquial\r\norder.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Nay, I am not aware of any _bookish_ anecdote concerning\r\nBraithwait. He was mentioned with Peacham as being a like accomplished\r\ncharacter.[354] Some of his pieces are written upon the same subjects\r\nas were Peacham's, and with great point and elegance. He seems,\r\nindeed, to have had the literary credit and moral welfare of his\r\ncountrymen so much at stake that, I confess, I have a vast fondness\r\nfor his lucubrations. His \"_English Gentlewoman_\" might be reprinted\r\nwith advantage.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 354: The talents of RICHARD BRAITHWAIT do not\r\n     appear to me to be so generally known and highly commended\r\n     as they merit to be. His _Nursery for Gentry_, 1651, 4to.\r\n     (with his portrait in an engraved frontispiece by Marshall),\r\n     is written with the author's usual point and spirit; but, as\r\n     I humbly conceive, is a less interesting performance than\r\n     his _English Gentleman_, 1633, 4to. (with a frontispiece by\r\n     Marshall), or _English Gentlewoman_, 1631, 4to. (also with a\r\n     frontispiece by the same artist). There is a terseness and\r\n     vigour in Braithwait's style which is superior to that of\r\n     his contemporary, Peacham; who seems to excel in a calm,\r\n     easy, and graceful manner of composition. Both these eminent\r\n     writers are distinguished for their scholastic and\r\n     gentlemanly attainments; but in the \"divine art of poesy\"\r\n     (in which light I mean here more particularly to display the\r\n     powers of Braithwait) Peacham has no chance of being\r\n     considered even as a respectable competitor with his\r\n     contemporary. Mr. George Ellis, in his pleasing _Specimens\r\n     of the early English Poets_, vol. iii., p. 103, has selected\r\n     two songs of Braithwait \"from a work not enumerated by\r\n     Wood;\" calling the author, \"a noted wit and poet.\" His fame,\r\n     however, is not likely to \"gather strength\" from these\r\n     effusions. It is from some passages in _The Arcadian\r\n     Princesse_--a work which has been already, and more than\r\n     once, referred to, but which is too dislocated and\r\n     heterogeneous to recommend to a complete perusal--it is from\r\n     some passages in _this_ work that I think Braithwait shines\r\n     with more lustre as a poet than in any to which his name is\r\n     affixed. Take the following miscellaneous ones, by way of\r\n     specimens. They are sometimes a little faulty in rhyme and\r\n     melody: but they are never lame from imbecility.\r\n\r\n                  ----he has the happiest wit,\r\n          Who has discretion to attemper it.\r\n          And of all others, those the least doe erre,\r\n          Who in opinion are least singular.\r\n          Let Stoicks be to opposition given,\r\n          Who to extreames in arguments are driven;\r\n          Submit thy judgment to another's will\r\n          If it be good; oppose it mildly, ill.\r\n\r\n          _Lib._ iv., p. 7.\r\n\r\n     Strong good sense has been rarely exhibited in fewer lines\r\n     than in the preceding ones. We have next a vigorously drawn\r\n     character which has the frightful appellation of\r\n\r\n                    _Uperephanos_, who still thought\r\n          That th' world without him would be brought to nought:\r\n          For when the dogge-starre raged, he used to cry,\r\n          \"No other Atlas has the world but I.\r\n          I am that only _Hee_, supports the state;\r\n          Cements divisions, shuts up Janus' gate;\r\n          Improves the publike fame, chalks out the way\r\n          How princes should command, subjects obey.\r\n          Nought passeth my discovery, for my sense\r\n          Extends itself to all intelligence.\"\r\n                                  &c. &c. &c.\r\n          So well this story and this embleme wrought,\r\n          _Uperephanos_ was so humble brought,\r\n          As he on earth disvalu'd nothing more,\r\n          Than what his vainest humour priz'd before.\r\n          More wise, but lesse conceited of his wit;\r\n          More pregnant, but lesse apt to humour it;\r\n          More worthy, 'cause he could agnize his want;\r\n          More eminent, because less arragant.\r\n          In briefe, so humbly-morally divine,\r\n          He was esteem'd the _Non-such_ of his time.\r\n\r\n          _Id._, pp. 8, 11.\r\n\r\n     Another character, with an equally bizarre name, is drawn\r\n     with the same vigour:\r\n\r\n                    _Melixos_; such a starved one,\r\n          As he had nothing left but skin and bone.\r\n          The shady substance of a living man,\r\n          Or object of contempt wheree'er he came.\r\n          Yet had hee able parts, and could discourse,\r\n          Presse moving reasons, arguments enforce,\r\n          Expresse his readings with a comely grace,\r\n          And prove himselfe a _Consul_ in his place!\r\n\r\n          _Id._, p. 12.\r\n\r\n     We have a still more highly-coloured, and indeed a terrific,\r\n     as well as original, picture, in the following animated\r\n     verses:\r\n\r\n            Next him, _Uptoomos_; one more severe,\r\n          Ne'er purple wore in this inferiour sphere:\r\n          Rough and distastefull was his nature still,\r\n          His life unsociable, as was his will.\r\n          _Eris_ and _Enio_ his two pages were,\r\n          His traine stern _Apuneia_ us'd to beare.\r\n          Terrour and thunder echo'd from his tongue,\r\n          Though weake in judgment, in opinion strong.\r\n          A fiery inflammation seiz'd his eyes,\r\n          Which could not well be temper'd any wise:\r\n          For they were bloud-shot, and so prone to ill,\r\n          As basiliske-like, where'ere they look, they kill.\r\n          No laws but Draco's with his humour stood,\r\n          For they were writ in characters of bloud.\r\n          His stomacke was distemper'd in such sort\r\n          Nought would digest; nor could he relish sport.\r\n          His dreames were full of melancholy feare,\r\n          Bolts, halters, gibbets, halloo'd in his eare:\r\n          Fury fed nature with a little food,\r\n          Which, ill-concocted, did him lesser good,\r\n\r\n          _Id._, p. 16.\r\n\r\n     But it is time to pause upon Braithwait. Whoever does not\r\n     see, in these specimens, some of the most powerful rhyming\r\n     couplets of the early half of the seventeenth century, if\r\n     not the model of some of the verses in Dryden's satirical\r\n     pieces, has read both poets with ears differently\r\n     constructed from those of the author of this book.]\r\n\r\nAs I am permitted to be desultory in my remarks, (and, indeed, I\r\ncraved this permission at the outset of them) I may here notice the\r\npublication of an excellent _Catalogue of Books_, in 1658, 4to.;\r\nwhich, like its predecessor, Maunsell's, helped to inflame the\r\npassions of purchasers, and to fill the coffers of booksellers.\r\nWhenever you can meet with this small volume, purchase it, Lisardo; if\r\nit be only for the sake of reading the spirited introduction prefixed\r\nto it.[355] The author was a man, whoever he may chance to be, of no\r\nmean intellectual powers. But to return.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 355: This volume, which has been rather fully\r\n     described by me in the edition of More's _Utopia_, vol. ii.,\r\n     p. 260, 284--where some specimens of the \"Introduction,\" so\r\n     strongly recommended by Lysander, will be found--is also\r\n     noticed in the _Athenæum_, vol. ii., 601; where there is an\r\n     excellent analysis of its contents. Here, let me subjoin\r\n     only one short specimen: In praise of learning, it is said:\r\n     \"Wise and learned men are the surest stakes in the hedge of\r\n     a nation or city: they are the best conservators of our\r\n     liberties: the hinges on which the welfare, peace, and\r\n     happiness, hang; the best public good, and only\r\n     commonwealth's men. These lucubrations, meeting with a true\r\n     and brave mind, can conquer men; and, with the basilisk,\r\n     kill envy with a look.\" Sign. E. 4. rect.]\r\n\r\nWhere sleep now the relics of DYSON'S Library, which supplied that\r\n_Helluo Librorum_, Richard Smith, with \"most of his rarities?\"[356] I\r\nwould give something pretty considerable to have a correct list--but\r\nmore to have an unmolested sight--of this library, in its original\r\nstate: if it were merely to be convinced whether or not it contained a\r\ncopy of the _first edition of Shakespeare_, of larger dimensions, and\r\nin cleaner condition, than the one in PHILANDER'S Collection!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 356: \"H. DYSON (says Hearne) a person of a very\r\n     strange, prying, and inquisitive genius, in the matter of\r\n     books, as may appear from many libraries; there being books,\r\n     chiefly in old English, almost in every library, that have\r\n     belonged to him, with his name upon them.\" _Peter Langtoft's\r\n     Chronicles_, vol. i., p. xiii. This intelligence Hearne\r\n     gleaned from his friend Mr. T. Baker. We are referred by the\r\n     former to the _Bibl. R. Smith_, p. 371, alias 401, No.\r\n     115, to an article, which confirms what is said of Smith's\r\n     \"collecting most of his rarities out of the library of H.\r\n     Dyson.\" The article is thus described in Bibl. Smith,\r\n     _ibid._; \"115 Six several catalogues of all such books,\r\n     touching the state ecclesiastical as temporal of the realm\r\n     of England, which were published upon several occasions, in\r\n     the reigns of K. Henry the viith and viiith, Philip and\r\n     Mary, Q. Elizabeth, K. James, and Charles I., collected by\r\n     Mr. H. Dyson: out of whose library was gathered, by Mr.\r\n     Smith, a great part of the rarities of this catalogue.\" A\r\n     catalogue of the books sold in the reign of Hen. VII. would\r\n     be invaluable to a bibliographer! Let me add, for the sake\r\n     of pleasing, or rather, perhaps, tantalising my good friend\r\n     Mr. Haleswood, that this article is immediately under one\r\n     which describes \"_An Ancient MS. of Hunting_, IN VELLUM\r\n     (wanting something) _quarto_.\" I hear him exclaim--\"Where is\r\n     this treasure now to be found?\" Perhaps, upon the cover of a\r\n     book of Devotion!]\r\n\r\nI have incidentally mentioned the name of RICHARD SMITH.[357] Such a\r\nbibliomaniac deserves ample notice, and the warmest commendation. Ah,\r\nmy Lisardo! had you lived in the latter days of Charles II.--had you,\r\nby accident, fallen into the society of this indefatigable\r\nbook-forager, while he pursued his book-rounds in _Little\r\nBritain_--could you have listened to his instructive conversation, and\r\nreturned home with him to the congenial quiet and avocations of his\r\nbook-room--would you, however caressed St. James's, or even smiled\r\nupon by the first Duchess in the land--have cared a rush for the\r\nsplendours of a Court, or concentrated your best comforts in a coach\r\ndrawn by six cream-coloured horses? Would you not, on the contrary,\r\nhave thought with this illustrious bibliomaniac, and with the sages of\r\nGreece and Rome before him, that \"in books is wisdom, and in wisdom is\r\nhappiness.\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 357: From the address To the Reader, prefixed to\r\n     the Catalogue of RICHARD SMITH'S books, which was put forth\r\n     by Chiswel the bookseller, in May 1682, 4to.--the\r\n     bibliomaniac is presented with the following interesting but\r\n     cramply written, particulars relating to the owner of them:\r\n     \"Though it be needless to recommend what to all intelligent\r\n     persons sufficiently commend itself, yet, perhaps, it may\r\n     not be unacceptable to the ingenious to have some short\r\n     account concerning _This so much celebrated, so often\r\n     desired, so long expected, Library_, now exposed to sale.\r\n     The gentleman that collected it was a person infinitely\r\n     curious and inquisitive after books; and who suffered\r\n     nothing considerable to escape him, that fell within the\r\n     compass of his learning; for he had not the vanity of\r\n     desiring to be master of more than he knew how to use. He\r\n     lived to a very great age, and spent a good part of it\r\n     almost entirely in the search of books. Being as constantly\r\n     known every day to walk his rounds through the shops as he\r\n     sat down to meals, where his great skill and experience\r\n     enabled him to make choice of what was not obvious to every\r\n     vulgar eye. He lived in times which ministered peculiar\r\n     opportunities of meeting with books that are not every day\r\n     brought into publick light; and few eminent libraries were\r\n     bought where he had not the liberty to pick and choose. And\r\n     while others were forming arms, and new-modelling kingdoms,\r\n     _his_ great ambition was to become master of a good BOOK.\r\n     Hence arose, as that vast number of his books, so the\r\n     choiceness and rarity of the greatest part of them; and that\r\n     of all kinds, and in all sorts of learning,\" &c. \"Nor was\r\n     the owner of them a meer idle possessor of so great a\r\n     treasure: for as he generally _collated_ his books upon the\r\n     buying of them (upon which account the buyer may rest pretty\r\n     secure of their being perfect) so he did not barely turn\r\n     over the leaves, but observed the defects of impressions,\r\n     and the ill arts used by many; compared the differences of\r\n     editions; concerning which, and the like cases, he has\r\n     entered memorable, and very useful, remarks upon very many\r\n     of the books under his own hand: Observations wherein,\r\n     certainly, never man was more diligent and industrious. Thus\r\n     much was thought fit to be communicated to publick notice,\r\n     by a gentleman who was intimately acquainted both with Mr.\r\n     Smith and his books. _This excellent library will be exposed\r\n     by auction, and the sale will begin on Monday the 15th day\r\n     of May next, at the auction house, known by the name of_ THE\r\n     SWAN, _in Great St. Bartholomew's Close, and there continue,\r\n     day by day, the five first days of every week, till all the\r\n     books be sold._\" In this catalogue of Richard Smith's books,\r\n     the sharp-eyed bibliomaniac will discover twelve volumes\r\n     printed by CAXTON; which collectively, produced only the sum\r\n     of 3_l._ 7_s._ 5_d._ The price of each of these volumes has\r\n     been already given to the public (_Typog. Antiq._, vol i.,\r\n     p. cxxxii.) I suppose a thousand guineas would _now_ barely\r\n     secure perfect copies of them! The catalogue itself is most\r\n     barbarously printed, and the arrangement and description of\r\n     the volumes such as to damn the compiler \"to everlasting\r\n     fame.\" A number of the most curious, rare, and intrinsically\r\n     valuable books--the very insertion of which in a\r\n     bookseller's catalogue would probably now make a hundred\r\n     bibliomaniacs start from their homes by star-light, in order\r\n     to come in for the _first pickings_--a number of volumes of\r\n     this description are huddled together in one lot, and all\r\n     these classed under the provoking running title of \"_Bundles\r\n     of Books_,\" or \"_Bundles of sticht Books_!\" But it is time\r\n     to bid adieu to this matchless collection. Leaving the\r\n     virtuoso \"to toil, from rise to set of sun\" after W.\r\n     Sherwin's \"extra rare and fine\" portrait of the collector,\r\n     which will cost him hard upon ten pounds (see _Sir William\r\n     Musgrave's Catalogue of English Portraits_, p. 92, no.\r\n     82), and to seize, if it be in his power, a copy of the\r\n     catalogue itself, \"with the prices and purchasers' names\"\r\n     (vide _Bibl. Lort._, no. 1354). I proceed to attend upon\r\n     Lysander: not, however, without informing him that Strype\r\n     (_Life of Cranmer_, p. 368), as well as Hearne (_Liber Niger\r\n     Scaccarii_, vol. ii., p. 542), has condescended to notice\r\n     the famous library of this famous collector of books,\r\n     RICHARD SMITH!]\r\n\r\nLIS. In truth I should have done even more than what your barren\r\nimagination has here depicted. Smith's figure, his address, his\r\nconversation, his library--\r\n\r\nLOREN. Enough--peace! There is no end to Lisardo's _fruitful_\r\nimagination. We are surfeited with the richness of it. Go on, dear\r\nLysander; but first, satisfy a desire which I just now feel to be\r\ninformed of the period when _Sales of Books, by Auction_, were\r\nintroduced into this country.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. You take _that_ for granted which remains [Transcriber's Note:\r\nmissing 'to' in original] be _proved_: namely, my ability to gratify\r\nyou in this particular. Of the precise period when this memorable\r\nrevolution in the sale of books took place I have no means of being\r\naccurately informed: but I should think not anterior to the year 1673,\r\nor 1674; for, in the year 1676, to the best of my recollection, the\r\ncatalogue of the Library of Dr. SEAMAN was put forth; to which is\r\nprefixed an address to the reader, wherein the custom of selling books\r\nby auction is mentioned as having been but of recent origin in our\r\ncountry.[358] It was, however, no sooner introduced than it caught\r\nthe attention, and pleased the palates, of bibliomaniacs exceedingly:\r\nand Clavel, a bookseller, who published useful catalogues of books to\r\nbe sold in his own warehouse, retorted in sharp terms upon the folly\r\nand extravagance which were exhibited at book auctions. However,\r\nneither Clavel nor his successors, from that period to the present,\r\nhave been able to set this custom aside, nor to cool the fury of\r\nbook-auction bibliomaniacs--who, to their eternal shame be it said,\r\nwill sometimes, from the hot and hasty passions which are stirred up\r\nby the poisonous miasmata floating in the auction-room, give a sum\r\ntwice or thrice beyond the real value of the books bidden for! Indeed,\r\nI am frequently amused to see the vehemence and rapture with which a\r\ndirty little volume is contended for and embraced--while a respectable\r\nbookseller, like PORTIUS, coolly observes across the table--\"I have a\r\nbetter copy on sale at one third of the price!\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 358: A part of the address \"To the Reader,\" in the\r\n     catalogue above-mentioned by Lysander, being somewhat of a\r\n     curiosity, is here reprinted in its unadulterated\r\n     [Transcriber's Note: remainder of sentence missing in\r\n     original]\r\n\r\n     \"Reader,\r\n\r\n     \"It hath not been usual here in England to make _Sale of\r\n     Books by way of Auction or who will give most for them_: But\r\n     it having been practised in other countreys to the advantage\r\n     both of buyers and sellers, it was therefore conceived (for\r\n     the encouragement of learning) to publish the sale of these\r\n     books this manner of way; and it is hoped that this will not\r\n     be unacceptable to schollers: and therefore, methought it\r\n     convenient to give an advertisement concerning the manner of\r\n     proceeding therein. _First_, That having this catalogue of\r\n     the books, and their editions, under their several heads and\r\n     numbers, it will be more easie for any person of quality,\r\n     gentleman, or others, to depute any one to buy such books\r\n     for them as they shall desire, if their occasions will not\r\n     permit them to be present at the auction themselves.\" The\r\n     _second_ clause is the usual one about _differences_\r\n     arising. The _third_, about discovering the imperfections of\r\n     the copies before they are taken away. The _fourth_, that\r\n     the buyers are to pay for their purchases within one month\r\n     after the termination of the auction. The _fifth_, that the\r\n     sale is to begin \"punctually at 9 o'clock in the morning,\r\n     and two in the afternoon; and this to continue daily until\r\n     all the books be sold; wherefore it is desired that the\r\n     gentlemen, or those deputed by them, may be there precisely\r\n     at the hours appointed, lest they should miss the\r\n     opportunity of buying those books which either themselves or\r\n     their friends desire.\" As this is the earliest auction\r\n     catalogue which I have chanced to meet with, the _present_\r\n     reader may probably be pleased with the following specimens,\r\n     selected almost at random of the prices which were given for\r\n     books at a public sale, in the year 1676.\r\n\r\n     _In Folio._ PHILOLOGISTS.\r\n\r\n                                                        _s._ _d._\r\n\r\n     Pet.

Two years after the preceding sale, namely, in\r\n     1678, were sold the collections of Dr. MANTON, Dr. WORSLEY,\r\n     and others. In the address to the Reader, prefixed to\r\n     Manton's catalogue, it would seem that this was the\r\n     \"_fourth_ triall\" of this mode of sale in our own country.\r\n     The conditions and time of sale the same as the preceding;\r\n     and because one Briggs, and not one Cooper, drew up the\r\n     same, Cooper craves the reader's \"excuse for the mistakes\r\n     that have happened; and desires that the saddle may be laid\r\n     upon the right horse.\" In this collection there is a more\r\n     plentiful sprinkling of English books; among which,\r\n     Dugdale's Warwickshire, 1656, was sold for 1_l._ 6_s._; and\r\n     Fuller's Worthies for the same sum. The \"Collections of\r\n     Pamphlets, bound together in Quarto,\" were immense. Dr.\r\n     Worsley's collection, with two others, was sold two months\r\n     afterwards; namely, in May, 1678: and from the address \"To\r\n     the Reader,\" it would appear that Dr. Manton's books brought\r\n     such high prices as to excite the envy of the trade.\r\n     Worsley's collection was sold at 9 and 2, the usual hours\r\n     \"at the house over against the hen and chickens, in\r\n     Pater-Noster Row.\" The venders thus justify themselves at\r\n     the close of their address: \"We have only this to add in\r\n     behalf of ourselves; that, forasmuch as a report has been\r\n     spread that we intend to use indirect means to advance the\r\n     prices, we do affirm that it is a groundless and malicious\r\n     suggestion of some of our own trade, envious of our\r\n     undertaking: and that, to avoid all manner of suspicion of\r\n     such practice, we have absolutely refused all manner of\r\n     commissions that have been offered us for buying (some of\r\n     them without limitation): and do declare that the company\r\n     shall have nothing but candid and ingenuous dealing from\r\n\r\n     JOHN DUNMORE.\r\n     RICHARD CHISWEL.\"\r\n\r\n     At this sale, the Shakspeare of 1632 brought 16_s._; and of\r\n     1663, 1_l._ 8_s._\r\n\r\n     In the November and December of the same year were sold by\r\n     auction the books of VOET, SANGAR, and others, and from the\r\n     preface to each catalogue it would seem that the sale of\r\n     books by auction was then but a recent, yet a very\r\n     successful, experiment; and that even collections from\r\n     abroad were imported, in order to be disposed of in a like\r\n     manner.]\r\n\r\nLIS. From what you say, it would appear to be wiser to lay out one's\r\nmoney at a bookseller's than at a book-auction?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Both methods must of necessity be resorted to: for you cannot\r\nfind with the one what you may obtain at the other. A distinguished\r\ncollector, such as the late Mr. Reed, or Mr. Gough, or Mr. Joseph\r\nWindham, dies, and leaves his library to be sold by auction for the\r\nbenefit of his survivors. Now, in this library so bequeathed, you have\r\nthe fruits of book-labour, collected for a long period, and cultivated\r\nin almost every department of literature. A thousand radii are\r\nconcentrated in such a circle; for it has, probably, been the object\r\nof the collector's life to gather and to concentrate these radii. In\r\nthis case, therefore, you must attend the auction; you must see how\r\nsuch a treasure is scattered, like the Sibylline leaves, by the winds\r\nof fate. You must catch at what you want, and for what you have been\r\na dozen years, perhaps, in the pursuit of. You will pay dearly for\r\nthese favourite volumes; but you have them, and that is comfort\r\nenough; and you exclaim, as a consolation amidst all the agony and\r\nwaste of time which such a contest may have cost you,--\"Where, at what\r\nbookseller's, are such gems now to be procured?\" All this may be well\r\nenough. But if I were again to have, as I have already had, the power\r\nof directing the taste and applying the wealth of a young\r\ncollector--who, on coming of age, wisely considers books of at least\r\nas much consequence as a stud of horses--I would say, go to Mr. Payne,\r\nor Mr. Evans, or Mr. Mackinlay, or Mr. Lunn, for your Greek and Latin\r\nClassics; to Mr. Dulau, or Mr. Deboffe, for your French; to Mr.\r\nCarpenter, or Mr. Cuthell, for your English; and to Mr. White for your\r\nBotany and rare and curious books of almost every description. Or, if\r\nyou want delicious copies, in lovely binding, of works of a sumptuous\r\ncharacter, go and drink coffee with Mr. Miller, of Albemarle\r\nStreet--under the warm light of an Argand lamp--amidst a blaze of\r\nmorocco and russia coating, which brings to your recollection the view\r\nof the Temple of the Sun in the play of Pizarro! You will also find,\r\nin the vender of these volumes, courteous treatment and \"gentlemanly\r\nnotions of men and things.\" Again, if you wish to speculate deeply in\r\nbooks, or to stock a newly-discovered province with what is most\r\nexcellent and popular in our own language, hire a vessel of 300 tons'\r\nburthen, and make a contract with Messrs. Longman, Hurst, and Co., who\r\nare enabled, from their store of _quires_, which measure 50 feet in\r\nheight, by 40 in length, and 20 in width, to satisfy all the wants of\r\nthe most craving bibliomaniacs. In opposition to this pyramid, enter\r\nthe closet of Mr. Triphook, jun., of St. James's Street--and resist,\r\nif it be in your power to resist, the purchase of those clean copies,\r\nso prettily bound, of some of our rarest pieces of black-letter\r\nrenown!\r\n\r\nLOREN. From this digression, oblige us now by returning to our\r\nbibliomaniacal history.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Most willingly. But I am very glad you have given me an\r\nopportunity of speaking, as I ought to speak, of some of our most\r\nrespectable booksellers, who are an ornament to the cause of THE\r\nBIBLIOMANIA.\r\n\r\nWe left off, I think, with noticing that renowned book-collector,\r\nRichard Smith. Let me next make honourable mention of a \"_par nobile\r\nfratrum_\" that ycleped are NORTH. The \"Lives\" of these men, with an\r\n\"Examen\" (of \"Kennet's History of England\"), were published by a\r\nrelative (I think a grandson) of the same name; and two very amusing\r\nand valuable quarto volumes they are! From one of these Lives, we\r\nlearn how pleasantly the LORD KEEPER used to make his meals upon some\r\none entertaining Law-volume or another: how he would breakfast upon\r\n_Stamford_,[359] dine upon _Coke_, and sup upon _Fitzherbert_, &c.;\r\nand, in truth, a most insatiable book appetite did this eminent judge\r\npossess. For, not satisfied (\"and no marvel, I trow\") with the\r\nforegoing lean fare, he would oftentimes regale himself with a\r\nwell-served-up course of the _Arts_, _Sciences_, and the\r\n_Belles-Lettres_!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 359: These are the words of LORD KEEPER NORTH'S\r\n     Biographer: \"There are of Law-Books, institutions of various\r\n     sorts, and reports of cases (now) almost innumerable. The\r\n     latter bear most the controversial law, and are read as\r\n     authority such as may be quoted: and I may say the gross of\r\n     law lecture lies in them. But to spend weeks and months\r\n     wholly in them, is like horses in a string before a loaden\r\n     waggon. They are indeed a careful sort of reading, and\r\n     chiefly require common-placing, and that makes the work go\r\n     on slowly. His LORDSHIP therefore used to mix some\r\n     institutionary reading with them, as after a fulness of the\r\n     reports in a morning, about noon, to take a repast in\r\n     _Stamford_, _Compton_, or the Lord _Coke's_ Pleas of the\r\n     Crown and Jurisdiction of Courts, _Manwood_ of the Forest\r\n     Law, _Fitzherbert's_ Natura Brevium; and also to look over\r\n     some of the Antiquarian Books, as _Britton_, _Bracton_,\r\n     _Fleta_, _Fortescue_, _Hengham_, _the old Tenures\r\n     Narrationes Novæ_, the old _Natura Brevium_, and the\r\n     Diversity of Courts. These, at times, for change and\r\n     refreshment, being books all fit to be known. And those\r\n     that, as to authority, are obsoleted, go rounder off-hand,\r\n     because they require little common-placing, and that only as\r\n     to matter very singular and remarkable, and such as the\r\n     student fancies he shall desire afterwards to recover. And,\r\n     besides all this, the day afforded him room for a little\r\n     History, especially of England, modern books, and\r\n     Controversy in Print, &c. In this manner he ordered his own\r\n     studies, but with excursions into _Humanity_ and _Arts_,\r\n     beyond what may be suitable to the genius of every young\r\n     student in the law.\" _Life of Lord Keeper Guildford_, pp.\r\n     18, 19. _North's Lives_, edit. 1754, 4to.]\r\n\r\nHis brother, Dr. JOHN NORTH, was a still greater _Helluo Librorum_;\r\n\"his soul being never so staked down as in an old bookseller's shop.\"\r\nNot content with a superficial survey of whatever he inspected, he\r\nseems to have been as intimately acquainted with all the book-selling\r\nfraternity of _Little-Britain_ as was his contemporary, Richard Smith;\r\nand to have entered into a conspiracy with ROBERT SCOTT[360]--the most\r\nrenowned book vender in this country, if not in Europe--to deprive\r\nall bibliomaniacs of a chance of procuring rare and curious volumes,\r\nby sweeping every thing that came to market, in the shape of a book,\r\ninto their own curiously-wrought and widely-spread nets. Nay, even\r\nScott himself was sometimes bereft of all power, by means of the\r\npotent talisman which this learned Doctor exercised--for the latter,\r\n\"at one lift,\" would now and then sweep a whole range of shelves in\r\nScott's shop of every volume which it contained. And yet how\r\nwhimsical, and, in my humble opinion, ill-founded, was Dr. North's\r\ntaste in matters of typography! Would you believe it, Lisardo, he\r\npreferred the meagre classical volumes, printed by the _Gryphii_, in\r\nthe italic letter, to the delicate and eye-soothing lustre of the\r\n_Elzevir_ type--?\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 360: \"Now he began to look after books, and to lay\r\n     the foundation of a competent library. He dealt with Mr.\r\n     ROBERT SCOTT, of _Little-Britain_, whose sister was his\r\n     grandmother's woman; and, upon that acquaintance he\r\n     expected, and really had from him, useful information of\r\n     books and their editions. This Mr. Scott was, in his time,\r\n     the greatest librarian in Europe; for, besides his stock in\r\n     England, he had warehouses in Francfort, Paris, and other\r\n     places, and dealt by factors. After he was grown old, and\r\n     much worn by multiplicity of business, he began to think of\r\n     his ease and to leave off. Whereupon he contracted with one\r\n     Mills, of St. Paul's Church-yard, near £10,000 deep, and\r\n     articled not to open his shop any more. But Mills, with his\r\n     auctioneering, Atlasses, and projects, failed, whereby poor\r\n     Scott lost above half his means: but he held to his contract\r\n     of not opening his shop, and when he was in London (for he\r\n     had a country house), passed most of his time at his house\r\n     amongst the rest of his books; and his reading (for he was\r\n     no mean scholar) was the chief entertainment of his time. He\r\n     was not only an expert bookseller, but a very conscientious\r\n     good man; and when he threw up his trade, Europe had no\r\n     small loss of him. Our Doctor, at one lift, bought of him a\r\n     whole set of Greek Classics in folio, of the best editions.\r\n     This sunk his stock at that time; but afterwards, for many\r\n     years of his life, all that he could (as they say) rap or\r\n     run, went the same way. But the progress was small; for such\r\n     a library as he desired, compared with what the pittance of\r\n     his stock would purchase, allowing many years to the\r\n     gathering, was of desperate expectation. He was early\r\n     sensible of a great disadvantage to him in his studies, by\r\n     the not having a good library in his reach; and he used to\r\n     say that a man could not be a scholar at the second-hand:\r\n     meaning, that learning is to be had from the original\r\n     authors, and not from any quotations, or accounts in other\r\n     books, for men gather with divers views, and, according to\r\n     their several capacities, often perfunctorily, and almost\r\n     always imperfectly: and through such slight reading, a\r\n     student may know somewhat, but not judge of either author or\r\n     subject. He used to say _an old author could not be\r\n     unprofitable_; for although in their proper time they had\r\n     little or no esteem, yet, in after times, they served to\r\n     interpret words, customs, and other matters, found obscure\r\n     in other books; of which A. Gellius is an apt instance. He\r\n     courted, as a fond lover, all _best editions, fairest\r\n     character, best bound and preserved_. If the subject was in\r\n     his favour (as the Classics) he cared not how many of them\r\n     he had, even of the same edition, if he thought it among the\r\n     best, either _better bound_, _squarer cut_, _neater covers_,\r\n     or some such qualification caught him. He delighted in the\r\n     small editions of the Classics, by Seb. Gryphius; and divers\r\n     of his acquaintance, meeting with any of them, bought and\r\n     brought them to him, which he accepted as choice presents,\r\n     although perhaps he had one or two of them before. He said\r\n     that the _black italic_ character agreed with his eye sight\r\n     (which he accounted but weak) better than any other print,\r\n     the old Elzevir not excepted, whereof the characters seemed\r\n     to him more blind and confused than those of the other.\r\n     Continual use gives men a judgment of things comparatively,\r\n     and they come to fix on that as most proper and easy which\r\n     no man, upon cursory view, would determine. _His soul was\r\n     never so staked down as in an old bookseller's shop_; for\r\n     having (as the statutes of the college required) taken\r\n     orders, he was restless till he had compassed some of that\r\n     sort of furniture as he thought necessary for his\r\n     profession. He was, for the most part, his own factor, and\r\n     seldom or never bought by commission; which made him lose\r\n     time in turning over vast numbers of books, and he was very\r\n     hardly pleased at last. I have borne him company at shops\r\n     for hours together, and, minding him of the time, he hath\r\n     made a dozen proffers before he would quit. By this care and\r\n     industry, at length, he made himself master of a very\r\n     considerable library, wherein the choicest collection was\r\n     _Greek_.\" There is some smartness in the foregoing\r\n     observations. The following, in a strain of equal interest,\r\n     affords a lively picture of the _bookselling trade_ at the\r\n     close of the 17th century: \"It may not be amiss to step a\r\n     little aside, to reflect on the vast change in the trade of\r\n     books, between that time and ours. Then, _Little-Britain_\r\n     was a plentiful and perpetual emporium of learned authors;\r\n     and men went thither as to a market. This drew to the place\r\n     a mighty trade; the rather because the shops were spacious,\r\n     and the learned gladly resorted to them, where they seldom\r\n     failed to meet with agreeable conversation. And the\r\n     booksellers themselves were knowing and conversible men,\r\n     with whom, for the sake of bookish knowledge, the greatest\r\n     wits were pleased to converse. And we may judge the time as\r\n     well spent there, as (in latter days) either in tavern or\r\n     coffee-house: though the latter hath carried off the spare\r\n     hours of most people. But now this emporium is vanished, and\r\n     trade contracted into the hands of two or three persons,\r\n     who, to make good their monopoly, ransack, not only their\r\n     neighbours of the trade that are scattered about town, but\r\n     all over England, aye, and beyond sea too, and send abroad\r\n     their circulators, and, in that manner, get into their hands\r\n     all that is valuable. The rest of the trade are content to\r\n     take their refuse, with which, and the fresh scum of the\r\n     press, they furnish one side of a shop, which serves for the\r\n     sign of a bookseller, rather than a real one; but, instead\r\n     of selling, dealing as factors, and procure what the country\r\n     divines and gentry send for; of whom each hath his book\r\n     factor, and, when wanting any thing, writes to his\r\n     bookseller, and pays his bill. And it is wretched to\r\n     consider what pickpocket work, with help of the press, these\r\n     demi-booksellers make. They crack their brains to find out\r\n     selling subjects, and keep hirelings in garrets, at hard\r\n     meat, to write and correct by the great (qu. groat); and so\r\n     puff up an octavo to a sufficient thickness, and there's six\r\n     shillings current for an hour and a half's reading, and\r\n     perhaps never to be read or looked upon after. One that\r\n     would go higher must take his fortune at blank walls, and\r\n     corners of streets, or repair to the sign of Bateman, Innys,\r\n     and one or two more, where are best choice and better\r\n     pennyworth's. I might touch other abuses, as bad paper,\r\n     incorrect printing, and false advertising; all which, and\r\n     worse, is to be expected, if a careful author is not at the\r\n     heels of them.\" Life of the Hon. and Rev.

Proceed, we are now advancing towards the threshold of\r\nthe eighteenth century; and the nearer you come to it, the greater is\r\nthe interest excited.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Take care that I don't conclude with the memorable\r\ncatalogue-burning deed of your father! But I spare your present\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\nAll hail to the noble book-spirit by which the _Lives of\r\nOxford-Athenians_, and the _Antiquities of Oxford University_, are\r\nrecorded and preserved beyond the power of decay![361] All hail to\r\nthee, OLD ANTHONY A-WOOD! May the remembrance of thy researches,\r\namidst thy paper and parchment documents, stored up in chests, pews,\r\nand desks, and upon which, alas! the moth was \"feeding sweetly,\" may\r\nthe remembrance of these thy laborious researches always excite\r\nsensations of gratitude towards the spirit by which they were\r\ndirected! Now I see thee, in imagination, with thy cautious step, and\r\nhead bowing from premature decay, and solemn air, and sombre visage,\r\nwith cane under the arm, pacing from library to library, through\r\ngothic quadrangles; or sauntering along the Isis, in thy way to some\r\nneighbouring village, where thou wouldst recreate thyself with \"pipe\r\nand pot.\" Yes, Anthony! while the _Bodleian_ and _Ashmolean_\r\ncollections remain--or rather as long as Englishmen know how to value\r\nthat species of literature by which the names and actions of their\r\nforefathers are handed down to posterity, so long shall the memory of\r\nthy laudable exertions continue unimpaired!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 361: The name and literary labours of ANTHONY WOOD\r\n     are now held in general, and deservedly high, respect: and\r\n     it is somewhat amusing, though not a little degrading to\r\n     human nature, to reflect upon the celebrity of that man who,\r\n     when living, seems to have been ridiculed by the proud and\r\n     flippant, and hated by the ignorant and prejudiced, part of\r\n     his academical associates. The eccentricities of Wood were\r\n     considered heretical; and his whims were stigmatized as\r\n     vices. The common herd of observers was unable to discover,\r\n     beneath his strange garb, and coarse exterior, all that\r\n     acuteness of observation, and retentiveness of memory, as\r\n     well as inflexible integrity, which marked the intellectual\r\n     character of this wonderful man. But there is no necessity\r\n     to detain and tantalize the reader by this formal train of\r\n     reasoning, when a few leading features of Wood's person,\r\n     manners, and habits of study, &c., have been thus pleasingly\r\n     described to us by Hearne, in the life of him prefixed to\r\n     the genuine edition of the _History and Antiquities (or\r\n     Annals) of the University of Oxford_. \"He was equally\r\n     regardless of envy or fame, out of his great love to truth,\r\n     and therefore 'twas no wonder he took such a liberty of\r\n     speech, as most other authors, out of prudence, cunning, or\r\n     design, have usually declined. And indeed, as to his\r\n     language, he used such words as were suitable to his\r\n     profession. It is impossible to think that men, who always\r\n     converse with old authors, should not learn the dialect of\r\n     their acquaintance--an antiquary retains an old word, with\r\n     as much religion as an old relick. And further, since our\r\n     author was ignorant of the rules of conversation, it is no\r\n     wonder he uses so many severe reflections, and adds so many\r\n     minute passages of men's lives. I have been told that it was\r\n     usual with him, for the most part, to rise about four\r\n     o'clock in the morning, and to eat hardly any thing till\r\n     night; when, after supper, he would go into some by-alehouse\r\n     in town, or else to one in some village near, and there by\r\n     himself take his _pipe and pot_,\" &c. \"But so it is that,\r\n     notwithstanding our author's great merits, he was but little\r\n     regarded in the University, being observed to be more\r\n     clownish than courteous, and always to go in an old\r\n     antiquated dress. Indeed he was a mere scholar, and\r\n     consequently must expect, from the greatest number of men,\r\n     disrespect; but this notwithstanding, he was always a true\r\n     lover of his mother, the University, and did more for her\r\n     than others care to do that have received so liberally from\r\n     her towards their maintenance, and have had greater\r\n     advantages of doing good than he had. Yea, his affection was\r\n     not at all alienated, notwithstanding his being so hardly\r\n     dealt with as to be expelled; which would have broken the\r\n     hearts of some. But our author was of a most noble spirit,\r\n     and little regarded whatever afflictions he lay under,\r\n     whilst he was conscious to himself of doing nothing but what\r\n     he could answer. At length after he had, by continual\r\n     drudging, worn out his body, he left this world contentedly,\r\n     by a stoppage of his urine, anno domini 1695, and was buried\r\n     in the east corner of the north side of St. John's Church,\r\n     adjoyning to Merton College, and in the wall is a small\r\n     monument fixed, with these words:\r\n\r\n          H.S.E.\r\n          ANTONIUS WOOD, ANTIQUARIUS.\r\n          _ob. 28 Nov._ AO. 1695, æt. 64.\"\r\n\r\n     In his person, he was of a large robust make, tall and thin,\r\n     and had a sedate and thoughtful look, almost bordering upon\r\n     a melancholy cast. Mr. Hearne says, in his _Collectanea\r\n     MSS._, that though he was but sixty-four years of age when\r\n     he died, he appeared to be above fourscore; that he used\r\n     spectacles long before he had occasion for them, that he\r\n     stooped much when he walked, and generally carried his stick\r\n     under his arm, seldom holding it in his hand. As to the\r\n     manner of his life, it was solitary and ascetic. The\r\n     character which Gassendus gives of Peireskius, may, with\r\n     propriety, be used as descriptive of Mr. Wood's. \"As to the\r\n     care of his person, cleanliness was his chief object, he\r\n     desiring no superfluity or costliness, either in his habit\r\n     or food. His house was furnished in the same manner as his\r\n     table; and as to the ornament of his private apartment, he\r\n     was quite indifferent. Instead of hangings, his chamber was\r\n     furnished with the prints of his particular friends, and\r\n     other men of note, with vast numbers of commentaries,\r\n     transcripts, letters, and papers of various kinds. His bed\r\n     was of the most ordinary sort; his table loaded with papers,\r\n     schedules, and other things, as was also every chair in the\r\n     room. He was a man of strict sobriety, and by no means\r\n     delicate in the choice of what he eat. Always restrained by\r\n     temperance, he never permitted the sweet allurements of\r\n     luxury to overcome his prudence.\" Such, as is here\r\n     represented, was the disposition of Mr. WOOD: of so retired\r\n     a nature as seldom to desire or admit a companion at his\r\n     walks or meals; so that he is said to have dined alone in\r\n     his chamber for thirty years together. Mr. Hearne says that\r\n     it was his custom to \"go to the booksellers at those hours\r\n     when the greater part of the University were at their\r\n     dinners,\" &c. And at five leaves further, in a note, we find\r\n     that, \"when he was consulting materials for his _Athenæ\r\n     Oxon._, he would frequently go to the booksellers, and\r\n     generally give money to them, purposely to obtain titles of\r\n     books from them; and 'twas observed of him that he spared no\r\n     charges to make that work as compleat and perfect as\r\n     possible.\" _Hearne's Coll. MSS. in Bodl. Lib._, vol. ix., p.\r\n     185. The following letter, describing Wood's last illness,\r\n     and the disposition of his literary property, is\r\n     sufficiently interesting to be here, in part, laid before\r\n     the reader: it was written by Mr. (afterwards Bishop) Tanner\r\n     to Dr. Charlett.\r\n\r\n     \"Honoured Master,\r\n\r\n     Yesterday, at dinner-time, Mr. Wood sent for me; when I\r\n     came, I found Mr. Martin and Mr. Bisse of Wadham (college)\r\n     with him, who had (with much ado) prevailed upon him to set\r\n     about looking over his papers, so to work we went, and\r\n     continued tumbling and separating some of his MSS. till it\r\n     was dark. We also worked upon him so far as to sign and\r\n     declare that sheet of paper, which he had drawn up the day\r\n     before, and called it _his will_; for fear he should not\r\n     live till night. He had a very bad night of it last night,\r\n     being much troubled with vomiting. This morning we three\r\n     were with him again, and Mr. Martin bringing with him the\r\n     form of a will, that had been drawn up by Judge Holloway, we\r\n     writ his will over again, as near as we could, in form of\r\n     law. He has given to the University, to be reposited in the\r\n     _Museum Ashmol._, all his MSS., not only those of his own\r\n     collection, but also all others which he has in his\r\n     possession, except some few of Dr. Langbain's Miscellanea,\r\n     which he is willing should go to the public library. He has\r\n     also given all his printed books and pamphlets to the said\r\n     musæum which are not there already. This benefaction will\r\n     not, perhaps, be so much valued by the University as it\r\n     ought to be, because it comes from Anthony Wood; but truly\r\n     it is a most noble gift, his collection of MSS. being\r\n     invaluable, and his printed books, most of them, not to be\r\n     found in town,\" &c. This letter is followed by other\r\n     accounts yet more minute and touching, of the last mortal\r\n     moments of poor old Anthony! It now remains to say a few\r\n     words about his literary labours. A short history of the\r\n     editions of the _Athenæ Oxonienses_ (vide p. 45, ante) has\r\n     already been communicated to the reader. We may here observe\r\n     that his _Antiquities of the University_ shared a similar\r\n     fate; being garbled in a Latin translation of them, which\r\n     was put forth under the auspices of Bishop Fell: 1676, fol.,\r\n     in 2 vols. Wood's own MS. was written in the English\r\n     language, and lay neglected till towards the end of the 18th\r\n     century, when the Rev. Mr. Gutch conferred a real benefit\r\n     upon all the dutiful sons of ALMA MATER, by publishing the\r\n     legitimate text of their venerable and upright historian;\r\n     under the title of _The History and Antiquities of the\r\n     Colleges and Halls_, 1786, 4to., with a supplemental volume\r\n     by way of _Appendix_, 1790, 4to., containing copious indexes\r\n     to the two. Then followed the Annals of the University at\r\n     large, viz. _The History and Antiquities of the University\r\n     of Oxford_; 1792, 4to., in two volumes; the latter being\r\n     divided into _two_ parts, or volumes, with copious indexes.\r\n     These works, which are now getting scarce, should be in\r\n     every philological, as well as topographical, collection. In\r\n     order to compensate the reader for the trouble of wading\r\n     through the preceding tremendous note, I here present him\r\n     with a wood-cut facsimile of a copper-plate print of Wood's\r\n     portrait, which is prefixed to his Life, 1772, 8vo. If he\r\n     wishes for more curious particulars respecting Wood's\r\n     literary labours, let him take a peep into _Thomæ Caii\r\n     Vindic. Antiq. Acad. Oxon._: 1730, 8vo., vol. i., pp. xl.\r\n     xliii. _Edit. Hearne._ Wood's study, in the Ashmolean\r\n     museum, is yet to be seen. It is filled with curious books,\r\n     which, however, have not hitherto been catalogued with\r\n     accuracy. Ritson has availed himself, more successfully than\r\n     any antiquary in poetry, of the book treasures in this\r\n     museum.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration]]\r\n\r\nA very few years after the death of this distinguished character, died\r\nDr. FRANCIS BERNARD;[362] a stoic in bibliography. Neither beautiful\r\nbinding, nor amplitude of margin, ever delighted his eye or rejoiced\r\nhis heart: for he was a stiff, hard, and straight-forward reader--and\r\nlearned, in Literary History, beyond all his contemporaries. His\r\ncollection was copious and excellent; and although the compiler of the\r\ncatalogue of his books sneers at any one's having \"an entire\r\ncollection in physic,\" (by the bye, I should have told you that\r\nBernard was a _Doctor of Medicine_,) yet, if I forget not, there are\r\nnearly 150 pages in this said catalogue which are thickly studded with\r\n\"_Libri Medici_,\" from the folio to the duodecimo size. Many very\r\ncurious books are afterwards subjoined; and some precious _bijous_, in\r\nEnglish Literature, close the rear. Let Bernard be numbered among the\r\nmost learned and eminent bibliomaniacs.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 362: I do not know that I could produce a better\r\n     recipe for the cure of those who are affected with the worst\r\n     symptoms of the BOOK-MANIA, in the _present day_, than by\r\n     shewing them how the same symptoms, upwards of a _century\r\n     ago_, were treated with ridicule and contempt by a collector\r\n     of very distinguished fame, both on account of his literary\r\n     talents and extensive library. The following copious extract\r\n     is curious on many accounts; and I do heartily wish that\r\n     foppish and tasteless collectors would give it a very\r\n     serious perusal. At the same time, all collectors possessed\r\n     of common sense and liberal sentiment will be pleased to see\r\n     their own portraits so faithfully drawn therein. It is taken\r\n     from the prefatory address,\r\n\r\n     \"TO THE READER.\r\n\r\n     The character of the person whose collection this was, is so\r\n     well known, that there is no occasion to say much of him,\r\n     nor to any man of judgment that inspects the catalogue of\r\n     the collection itself. Something, however, it becomes us to\r\n     say of both; and this I think may with truth and modesty\r\n     enough be said, that as few men knew books, and that part of\r\n     learning which is called _Historia Litteraria_, better than\r\n     himself, so there never yet appeared in England so choice\r\n     and valuable a catalogue to be thus disposed of as this\r\n     before us: more especially of that sort of books which are\r\n     out of the common course, which a man may make the business\r\n     of his life to collect, and at last not to be able to\r\n     accomplish. A considerable part of them being so little\r\n     known, even to many of the learned buyers, that we have\r\n     reason to apprehend this misfortune to attend the sale, that\r\n     there will not be competitors enough to raise them up to\r\n     their just and real value. Certain it is this library\r\n     contains not a few which never appeared in any auction here\r\n     before; nor indeed, as I have heard him say, for ought he\r\n     knew, (and he knew as well as any man living) _in any\r\n     printed catalogue in the world_.\"--\"We must confess that,\r\n     being a person who collected his books for use, and not for\r\n     ostentation or ornament, he seemed no more solicitous about\r\n     _their_ dress than _his own_; and therefore you'll find that\r\n     a _gilt back_, or a _large margin_, was very seldom any\r\n     inducement to him to buy. 'Twas sufficient that he had the\r\n     book.\" \"Though considering that he was so unhappy as to want\r\n     heirs capable of making that use of them which he had done,\r\n     and that therefore they were to be dispersed after this\r\n     manner; I have heard him condemn his own negligence in that\r\n     particular; observing, that the garniture of a book was as\r\n     apt to recommend it to a great part of our _modern\r\n     collectors_ (whose learning goes not beyond the edition, the\r\n     title-page, and the printer's name) as the intrinsic value\r\n     could. But that he himself was not a mere nomenclator, and\r\n     versed only in title-pages, but had made that just and\r\n     laudable use of his books which would become all those that\r\n     set up for collectors, I appeal to the Literati of his\r\n     acquaintance, who conversed most frequently with him; how\r\n     full, how ready, and how exact he was in answering any\r\n     question that was proposed to him relating to learned men,\r\n     or their writings; making no secret of any thing that he\r\n     knew, or any thing that he had; being naturally one of the\r\n     most communicative men living, both of his knowledge and his\r\n     books.\"--\"And give me leave to say this of him, upon my own\r\n     knowledge; that he never grudged his money in procuring, nor\r\n     his time or labour in perusing, any book which he thought\r\n     could be any ways instructive to him, and having the\r\n     felicity of a memory always faithful, always officious,\r\n     which never forsook him, though attacked by frequent and\r\n     severe sickness, and by the worst of diseases, old age, his\r\n     desire of knowledge attended him to the last; and he pursued\r\n     his studies with equal vigour and application to the very\r\n     extremity of his life.\" It remains to add a part of the\r\n     title of the catalogue of the collection of this\r\n     extraordinary bibilomaniac [Transcriber's Note:\r\n     bibliomaniac]: \"_A Catalogue of the Library of the late\r\n     learned_ DR. FRANCIS BERNARD, _Fellow of the College of\r\n     Physicians, and Physician to St. Bartholomew's Hospital,\r\n     &c._,\" 1698, 8vo. The English books are comprised in 1241\r\n     articles; and, among them, the keen investigator of ancient\r\n     catalogues will discover some prime rarities.]\r\n\r\nHaving at length reached the threshold, let us knock at the door, of\r\nthe eighteenth century. What gracious figures are those which approach\r\nto salute us? They are the forms of BISHOPS FELL and MORE:[363]\r\nprelates, distinguished for their never ceasing admiration of\r\nvaluable and curious works. The former is better known as an editor;\r\nthe latter, as a collector--and a collector, too, of such multifarious\r\nknowledge, of such vivid and just perceptions, and unabating\r\nactivity--that while he may be hailed as the _Father of_ =black-letter=\r\n_Collectors_ in this country, he reminds us of his present successor\r\nin the same see; who is not less enamoured of rare and magnificent\r\nvolumes, but of a different description, and whose library assumes a\r\ngrander cast of character.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 363: As I have already presented the public with\r\n     some brief account respecting BISHOP FELL, and sharpened the\r\n     appetites of Grangerites to procure rather a rare portrait\r\n     of the same prelate (See _Introd. to the Classics_, vol. i.,\r\n     89), it remains only to add, in the present place, that\r\n     Hearne, in his _Historia Vitæ et Regni Ricardi II._, 1729,\r\n     8vo., p. 389, has given us a curious piece of information\r\n     concerning this eminent bibliomaniac, which may not be\r\n     generally known. His authority is Anthony Wood. From this\r\n     latter we learn that, when Anthony and the Bishop were\r\n     looking over the _History and Antiquities of the University\r\n     of Oxford_, to correct it for the press, Fell told Wood that\r\n     \"WICLIFFE was a grand dissembler; a man of little\r\n     conscience; and what he did, as to religion, was more out of\r\n     vain glory, and to obtain unto him a name, than out of\r\n     honesty--or to that effect.\" Can such a declaration, from\r\n     such a character, be credited? BISHOP MORE has a stronger\r\n     claim on our attention and gratitude. Never has there\r\n     existed an episcopal bibliomaniac of such extraordinary\r\n     talent and fame in the walk of _Old English Literature_!--as\r\n     the reader shall presently learn. The bishop was admitted of\r\n     Clare Hall, Cambridge, in 1662. In 1691, he became Bishop of\r\n     Norwich; and was translated to Ely in 1707; but did not\r\n     survive the translation above seven years. How soon and how\r\n     ardently the passion for collecting books possessed him it\r\n     is out of my present power to make the reader acquainted.\r\n     But that More was in the zenith of his bibliomaniacal\r\n     reputation while he filled the see of Norwich is\r\n     unquestionable; for thus writes Strype: \"The Right Reverend,\r\n     the Lord Bishop of Norwich, the possessor of a great and\r\n     curious collection of MSS. and other ancient printed pieces\r\n     (little inferior to MSS. in regard of their scarceness) hath\r\n     also been very considerably assistant to me as well in this\r\n     present work as in others;\" &c. Preface (sign. a 2) to _Life\r\n     of Aylmer_, 1701, 8vo. Burnet thus describes his fine\r\n     library when he was Bishop of Ely. \"This noble record was\r\n     lent me by my reverend and learned brother, Dr. MORE, Bishop\r\n     of Ely, who has gathered together a most valuable treasure,\r\n     both of printed books and manuscripts, beyond what one can\r\n     think that the life and labour of one man could have\r\n     compassed; and which he is as ready to communicate, as he\r\n     has been careful to collect it.\" _Hist. of the Reformation_,\r\n     vol. iii., p. 46. It seems hard to reconcile this testimony\r\n     of Burnet with the late Mr. Gough's declaration, that \"The\r\n     bishop collected his library by plundering those of the\r\n     clergy in his diocese; some he paid with sermons or more\r\n     modern books; others only with '_quid illiterati cum\r\n     libris_.'\" On the death of More, his library was offered to\r\n     Lord Oxford for 8000_l._; and how that distinguished and\r\n     truly noble collector could have declined the purchase of\r\n     such exquisite treasures--unless his own shelves were\r\n     groaning beneath the weight of a great number of similar\r\n     volumes--is difficult to account for. But a public-spirited\r\n     character was not wanting to prevent the irreparable\r\n     dispersion of such book-gems: and that patriotic character\r\n     was GEORGE I.!--who gave 6000_l._ for them, and presented\r\n     them to the public library of the University of Cambridge!--\r\n\r\n          \"These are imperial works, and worthy kings!\"\r\n\r\n     And here, benevolent reader, the almost unrivalled\r\n     _Bibliotheca Moriana_ yet quietly and securely reposes. Well\r\n     do I remember the congenial hours I spent (A.D. 1808) in the\r\n     _closet_ holding the most precious part of Bishop More's\r\n     collection, with my friend the Rev. Mr. ----, tutor of one\r\n     of the colleges in the same University, at my\r\n     right-hand--(himself \"greatly given to the study of books\")\r\n     actively engaged in promoting my views, and increasing my\r\n     extracts--but withal, eyeing me sharply \"ever and anon\"--and\r\n     entertaining a laudable distrust of a keen book-hunter from\r\n     a rival University! I thank my good genius that I returned,\r\n     as I entered, with clean hands! My love of truth and of\r\n     bibliography compels me to add, with a sorrowful heart, that\r\n     not only is there no printed catalogue of Bishop More's\r\n     books, but even the FINE PUBLIC LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY\r\n     remains unpublished in print! In this respect they really do\r\n     \"order things better in France.\" Why does such indifference\r\n     to the cause of general learning exist--and in the 19th\r\n     century too? Let me here presume to submit a plan to the\r\n     consideration of the syndics of the press; provided they\r\n     should ever feel impressed with the necessity of informing\r\n     the literati, of other countries as well as our own, of the\r\n     book treasures contained in the libraries of Cambridge. It\r\n     is simply this. Let the books in the Public Library form the\r\n     substratum of the _Catalogue Raisonné_ to be printed in\r\n     three or more quarto volumes. If, in any particular\r\n     department, there be valuable editions of a work which are\r\n     _not_ in the public, but in another, library--ex. gr. in\r\n     Trinity, or St. John's--specify this edition in its\r\n     appropriate class; and add _Trin. Coll., &c._--If this copy\r\n     contain notes of Bentley, or Porson, add \"_cum notis\r\n     Bentleii_,\" _&c._: so that such a catalogue would present,\r\n     not only _every_ volume in the _Public Library_, but _every\r\n     valuable_ edition of a work in the whole University. Nor is\r\n     the task so Herculean as may be thought. The tutors of the\r\n     respective colleges would, I am sure, be happy, as well as\r\n     able, to contribute their proportionate share of labour\r\n     towards the accomplishment of so desirable and invaluable a\r\n     work.]\r\n\r\nThe opening of the 18th century was also distinguished by the death of\r\na bibliomaniac of the very first order and celebrity. Of one, who had,\r\nno doubt, frequently discoursed largely and eloquently with Luttrell,\r\n(of whom presently) upon the rarity and value of certain editions of\r\nold _Ballad Poetry_: and between whom presents of curious black-letter\r\nvolumes were, in all probability, frequently passing. I allude to the\r\nfamous SAMUEL PEPYS;[364] Secretary to the Admiralty.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 364: \"_The Maitland Collection of Manuscripts_ was\r\n     ever in the collector's (Sir Richard Maitland's)\r\n     family.\"--\"His grandson was raised to the dignity of Earl of\r\n     Lauderdale.\" \"The Duke of Lauderdale, a descendant of the\r\n     collector's grandson, presented the Maitland Collection,\r\n     along with other MSS., to SAMUEL PEPYS, Esq. Secretary of\r\n     the Admiralty to Charles II. and James II. Mr. Pepys was one\r\n     of the earliest collectors of rare books, &c. in England;\r\n     and the duke had no taste for such matters; so either from\r\n     friendship, or some point of interest, he gave them to Mr.\r\n     Pepys,\"--who \"dying 26 May, 1703, in his 71st year, ordered,\r\n     by will, the PEPYSIAN LIBRARY at Magdalen College,\r\n     Cambridge, to be founded, in order to preserve his very\r\n     valuable collection entire. It is undoubtedly the most\r\n     curious in England, those of the British Museum excepted;\r\n     and is kept in excellent order.\" Mr. Pinkerton's preface, p.\r\n     vii., to _Ancient Scottish Poems from the Maitland\r\n     Collection, &c._, 1786, 8vo., 2 vols. I wish it were in my\r\n     power to add something concerning the parentage, birth,\r\n     education, and pursuits of the extraordinary collector of\r\n     this extraordinary collection; but no biographical work,\r\n     which I have yet consulted, vouchsafes even to mention his\r\n     name. His merits are cursorily noticed in the _Quarterly\r\n     Review_, vol. iv., p. 326-7. Through the medium of a friend,\r\n     I learn from Sir Lucas Pepys, Bart., that our illustrious\r\n     bibliomaniac, his great uncle, was President of the Royal\r\n     Society, and that his collection at Cambridge contains a\r\n     _Diary_ of his life, written with his own hand. But it is\r\n     high time to speak of the black-letter gems contained in the\r\n     said collection. That the PEPYSIAN COLLECTION is at once\r\n     choice and valuable cannot be disputed; but that access to\r\n     the same is prompt and facile, is not quite so indisputable.\r\n     There is a MS. catalogue of the books, by Pepys himself,\r\n     with a small rough drawing of a view of the interior of the\r\n     library. The books are kept in their original (I think\r\n     walnut-wood) presses: and cannot be examined unless in the\r\n     presence of a fellow.--Such is the nice order to be\r\n     observed, according to the bequest, that every book must be\r\n     replaced where it was taken from; and the loss of a single\r\n     volume causes the collection to be confiscated, and\r\n     transported to Benet-college library. Oh, that there were\r\n     _an act of parliament_ to regulate bequests of this\r\n     kind!--that the doors to knowledge might, by a greater\r\n     facility of entrance, be more frequently opened by students;\r\n     and that the medium between unqualified confidence and\r\n     unqualified suspicion might be marked out and followed. Are\r\n     these things symptomatic of an iron or a brazen age! But the\r\n     bibliomaniac is impatient for a glance at the 'forementioned\r\n     black-letter treasures!--Alas, I have promised more than I\r\n     can perform! Yet let him cast his eye upon the first volume\r\n     of the recent edition of _Evans' Collection of Old Ballads_\r\n     (see _in limine_, p. ix.) and look into the valuable notes\r\n     of _Mr. Todd's Illustrations of Gower and Chaucer_,--in\r\n     which latter, he will find no bad specimen of these\r\n     _Pepysian gems_, in the exultation of my friend, the author,\r\n     over another equally respected friend--in consequence of his\r\n     having discovered, among these treasures, a strange, merry,\r\n     and conceited work, entitled \"_Old Meg of Herefordshire for\r\n     a Mayd-Marian; and Hereford Town for a Morris-daunce, &c._,\"\r\n     1609, 4to., p. 273. EX UNO DISCE OMNES. The left-handed\r\n     critic, or anti-black-letter reader, will put a wicked\r\n     construction upon the quotation of this motto in capital\r\n     letters: let him: he will repent of his folly in due time.]\r\n\r\nNow it was a convincing proof to me, my dear friends, that the\r\nindulgence of a PASSION FOR BOOKS is perfectly compatible with any\r\nsituation, however active and arduous. For while this illustrious\r\nbibliomaniac was sending forth his messengers to sweep every\r\nbookseller's shop from the Tweed to Penzance, for the discovery of old\r\nand almost unknown ballads--and while his name rung in the ears of\r\nrival collectors--he was sedulous, in his professional situation, to\r\nput the _Navy of Old England_ upon the most respectable footing; and\r\nis called the _Father_ of that system which, carried into effect by\r\nBritish hearts of oak, has made the thunder of our cannon to be heard\r\nand feared on the remotest shores. Nor is it a slight or common\r\ncoincidence that a spirit of book-collecting, which stimulated the\r\n_Secretary_ of the Admiralty at the opening of the 18th century,\r\nshould, at the close of it, have operated with equal or greater force\r\nin a _First Lord_ of the same glorious department of our\r\nadministration. But we shall speak more fully of this latter\r\ncharacter, and of his matchless collection, in a future stage of our\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nWhile we are looking round us at this period, we may as well slightly\r\nnotice the foundation of the _Blenheim Library_. The DUKE OF\r\nMARLBOROUGH[365] was resolved that no naval commander, or person\r\nconnected with the navy, should eclipse himself in the splendour of\r\nbook-collecting: but it was to PRINCE EUGENE that Marlborough was\r\nindebted for his taste in this particular; or rather the English\r\ncommander was completely bitten with the bibliomaniacal disease in\r\nconsequence of seeing Eugene secure rare and magnificent copies of\r\nworks, when a city or town was taken: and the German Prince himself\r\nexpatiates upon the treasures of his library, with a rapture with\r\nwhich none but the most thorough-bred bibliomaniacs can ever\r\nadequately sympathise.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 365: The LIBRARY AT BLENHEIM is one of the\r\n     grandest rooms in Europe. The serpentine sheet of water,\r\n     which flows at some little distance, between high banks of\r\n     luxuriant and moss-woven grass, and is seen from the\r\n     interior, with an overhanging dark wood of oaks, is\r\n     sufficient to awaken the finest feelings that ever animated\r\n     the breast of a bibliomaniac. The books are select and\r\n     curious, as well as numerous; and although they may be\r\n     eclipsed, in both these particulars, by a few rival\r\n     collections, yet the following specimen is no despicable\r\n     proof of the ardour with which MARLBOROUGH, the founder of\r\n     the Library, pushed forward his bibliomaniacal spirit.

He is making collections in those departments of\r\n     literature in which the Blenheim Library is comparatively\r\n     deficient; and his success has already been such as to lead\r\n     us to hope for as perfect a display of volumes printed by\r\n     _Caxton_ as there is of those executed by foreign printers.\r\n     The Marquis's collection of _Emblems_ is, I believe, nearly\r\n     perfect: of these, there are a few elegantly printed\r\n     catalogues for private distribution. Lysander, above,\r\n     supposes that Marlborough caught the infection of the\r\n     _book-disease_ from PRINCE EUGENE; and the supposition is,\r\n     perhaps, not very wide of the truth. The library of this\r\n     great German prince, which is yet entire, (having been\r\n     secured from the pillage of Gallic Vandalism, when a certain\r\n     emperor visited a certain city) is the proudest feature in\r\n     the public library at Vienna. The books are in very fine old\r\n     binding, and, generally of the largest dimensions. And,\r\n     indeed, old England has not a little to boast of (at least,\r\n     so bibliomaniacs must always think) that, from the recently\r\n     published _Memoirs of Eugene_ (1811, 8vo., p. 185), it would\r\n     appear that the prince \"bought his fine editions of books AT\r\n     LONDON:\"--he speaks also of his \"excellent French, Latin,\r\n     and Italian works, well bound\"--as if he enjoyed the\r\n     \"arrangment\" of _them_, as much as the contemplation of his\r\n     \"cascades, large water-spouts, and superb basins.\" _Ibid._\r\n     Whether Eugene himself was suddenly inflamed with the ardour\r\n     of buying books, from some lucky spoils in the pillaging of\r\n     towns--as Lysander supposes--is a point which may yet admit\r\n     of fair controversy. For my own part, I suspect the German\r\n     commander had been straying, in his early manhood, among the\r\n     fine libraries in _Italy_, where he might have seen the\r\n     following exquisite _bijous_--\r\n\r\n     _In St. Mark's, at Venice._\r\n\r\n     Apuleius             1469  }\r\n     Aulus Gellius        1469  }  PRINTED UPON VELLUM.\r\n     Petrarca             1479  }\r\n\r\n     _In the Chapter House at Padua._\r\n\r\n     Ciceronis _Epist. ad Atticum_ _Jenson_ 1470  }\r\n     Quintilian                    _Jenson_ 1471  }\r\n     Macrobius                              1472  }\r\n     Solinus                       _Jenson_ 1473  } PRINTED UPON VELLUM.\r\n     Catullus                               1472  }\r\n     Plautus                                1472  }\r\n     Ovidii Opera                  _Bonon._ 1471  }\r\n\r\n     The public is indebted to Mr. Edwards for the timely supply\r\n     of the foregoing bibliographical intelligence.]\r\n\r\nEver ardent in his love of past learning, and not less voracious in\r\nhis bibliomaniacal appetites, was the well known NARCISSUS LUTTRELL.\r\nNothing--if we may judge from the spirited sketch of his book\r\ncharacter, by the able editor[366] of Dryden's works--nothing would\r\nseem to have escaped his Lynx-like vigilance. Let the object be what\r\nit would (especially if it related to _poetry_) let the volume be\r\ngreat or small, or contain good, bad, or indifferent warblings of the\r\nmuse--his insatiable craving had \"stomach for them all.\" We may\r\nconsider his collection as the fountain head of those copious streams\r\nwhich, after fructifying the libraries of many bibliomaniacs in the\r\nfirst half of the eighteenth century, settled, for a while, more\r\ndeterminedly, in the curious book-reservoir of a Mr. WYNNE--and hence,\r\nbreaking up, and taking a different direction towards the collections\r\nof Farmer, Steevens, and others, they have almost lost their identity\r\nin the innumerable rivulets which now inundate the book-world.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 366: \"In this last part of his task, the editor\r\n     (Walter Scott) has been greatly assisted by free access to a\r\n     valuable collection of fugitive pieces of the reigns of\r\n     Charles II., James II., William III., and Queen Anne. This\r\n     curious collection was made by NARCISSUS LUTTRELL, Esq.,\r\n     under whose name the Editor usually quotes it. The\r\n     industrious collector seems to have bought every poetical\r\n     tract, of whatever merit, which was hawked through the\r\n     streets in his time, marking carefully the price and date of\r\n     the purchase. His collection contains the earliest editions\r\n     of many of our most excellent poems, bound up, according to\r\n     the order of time, with the lowest trash of Grub-street. It\r\n     was dispersed on Mr. Luttrell's death,\" &c. Preface to _The\r\n     Works of John Dryden_, 1808: vol. i., p. iv. Mr. James\r\n     Bindley and Mr. Richard Heber are then mentioned, by the\r\n     editor, as having obtained a great share of the Luttrell\r\n     collection, and liberally furnished him with the loan of the\r\n     same, in order to the more perfect editing of Dryden's\r\n     Works. But it is to the persevering book-spirit of Mr.\r\n     EDWARD WYNNE, as Lysander above intimates, that these\r\n     notorious modern bibliomaniacs are indebted for the\r\n     preservation of most of the choicest relics of the\r\n     _Bibliotheca Luttrelliana_. Mr. Wynne lived at Little\r\n     Chelsea; and built his library in a room which had the\r\n     reputation of having been LOCKE'S _study_. Here he used to\r\n     sit, surrounded by innumerable books--a \"great part being\r\n     formed by an eminent and curious collector in the last\r\n     century\"--viz. the aforesaid Narcissus Luttrell. (See the\r\n     title to the Catalogue of his Library.) His books were sold\r\n     by auction in 1786; and, that the reader may have some faint\r\n     idea of the treasures contained in the _Bibliotheca\r\n     Wynniana_, he is presented with the following extracts:\r\n\r\n     LOT 2 A parcel of pamphlets on poetry, 8vo. £2 0_s._ 0_d._\r\n\r\n     3 Do.

Purchased by the\r\n     present Marquis of Bute 7 7 0\r\n\r\n     14 Do. of single sheets, giving an account of the various\r\n     sieges in Ireland in 1695-6; and consisting likewise of\r\n     Elegies, Old Ballads, accounts of Murders, Storms, Political\r\n     Squibs, &c. &c., _many of them with curious plates_, from\r\n     1695 to 1706. Purchased by the same 6 16 6\r\n\r\n     Lots 23-4 comprised a great number of \"_Old Poetry and\r\n     Romances_,\" which were purchased by Mr. Baynes for 7_l._\r\n     9_s._ Lot 376 comprehended a \"_Collection of Old\r\n     Plays--Gascoigne, White, Windet, Decker, &c._,\" 21 vols.:\r\n     which were sold for 38_l._ 17_s._ Never, to be sure, was a\r\n     precious collection of English History and Poetry so\r\n     wretchedly detailed to the public, in an auction catalogue!\r\n     It should be noticed that a great number of poetical tracts\r\n     was disposed of, previous to the sale, to Dr. FARMER, who\r\n     gave not more than forty guineas for them. The Doctor was\r\n     also a determined purchaser at the sale, and I think the\r\n     ingenious Mr. Waldron aided the illustrious commentator of\r\n     Shakspeare with many a choice volume. It may be worth adding\r\n     that Wynne was the author of an elegant work, written in the\r\n     form of dialogues, entitled _Eunomus_, or _Discourses upon\r\n     the Laws of England_, 4 vols., 8vo. It happened to be\r\n     published at the time when Sir William Blackstone's\r\n     _Commentaries on the Laws of England_ made their appearance;\r\n     and, in consequence, has seen only three editions: the\r\n     latter being published in 1809, 2 vols., 8vo.]\r\n\r\nWhy have I delayed, to the present moment, the mention of that\r\nillustrious bibliomaniac, EARL PEMBROKE? a patron of poor scholars,\r\nand a connoisseur, as well as collector, of every thing the most\r\nprecious and rare in the book-way. Yet was his love of _Virtû_ not\r\nconfined to objects in the shape of volumes, whether printed or in\r\nMS.: his knowledge of statues and coins was profound;[367] and his\r\ncollection of these, such as to have secured for him the admiration\r\nof posterity.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 367:\r\n\r\n     [Illustration]\r\n\r\n     The reader will find an animated eulogy on this great\r\n     nobleman in Walpole's _Anecdotes of Painters_, vol. iv.,\r\n     227; part of which was transcribed by Joseph Warton for his\r\n     variorum edition of Pope's works, and thence copied into the\r\n     recent edition of the same by the Rev. W.L. Bowles. But\r\n     PEMBROKE deserved a more particular notice. Exclusively of\r\n     his fine statues and architectural decorations, the Earl\r\n     contrived to procure a great number of curious and rare\r\n     books; and the testimonies of Maittaire (who speaks indeed\r\n     of him with a sort of rapture!) and Palmer show that the\r\n     productions of Jenson and Caxton were no strangers to his\r\n     library. _Annales Typographici_, vol. i., 13. edit. 1719.\r\n     _History of Printing_, p. 5. \"There is nothing that so\r\n     surely proves the pre-eminence of virtue more than the\r\n     universal admiration of mankind, and the respect paid it by\r\n     persons in opposite interests; and, more than this, it is a\r\n     sparkling gem which even time does not destroy: it is hung\r\n     up in the Temple of Fame, and respected for ever.\"\r\n     _Continuation of Granger_, vol. i., 37, &c. \"He raised\r\n     (continues Mr. Noble) a collection of antiques that were\r\n     unrivalled by any subject. His learning made him a fit\r\n     companion for the literati. Wilton will ever be a monument\r\n     of his extensive knowledge; and the princely presents it\r\n     contains, of the high estimation in which he was held by\r\n     foreign potentates, as well as by the many monarchs he saw\r\n     and served at home. He lived rather as a primitive\r\n     christian; in his behaviour, meek; in his dress, plain:\r\n     rather retired, conversing but little.\" Burnet, in the\r\n     _History of his own Times_, has spoken of the Earl with\r\n     spirit and propriety. Thus far the first edition of the\r\n     Bibliomania. From an original MS. letter of Anstis to Ames\r\n     (in the possession of Mr. John Nichols) I insert the\r\n     following memoranda, concerning the book celebrity of Lord\r\n     Pembroke. \"I had the book of Juliana Barnes (says Anstis)\r\n     printed at St. Albans, 1486, about hunting, which was\r\n     afterwards reprinted by W. de Worde at Westminster,\r\n     1496--but the EARL OF PEMBROKE would not rest till he got it\r\n     from me.\" From a letter to Lewis (the biographer of Caxton)\r\n     by the same person, dated Oct. 11, 1737, Anstis says that\r\n     \"the Earl of Pembroke would not suffer him to rest till he\r\n     had presented it to him.\" He says also that \"he had a later\r\n     edition of the same, printed in 1496, _on parchment_, by W.\r\n     de Worde, which he had given away: but he could send to the\r\n     person who had it.\" From another letter, dated May 8, 1740,\r\n     this \"person\" turns out to be the famous JOHN MURRAY; to\r\n     whom we are shortly to be introduced. The copy, however, is\r\n     said to be \"imperfect; but the St. Albans book, a fair\r\n     folio.\" In this letter, Lord Pembroke's library is said to\r\n     hold \"the greatest collection of the first books printed in\r\n     England.\" Perhaps the reader will not be displeased to be\r\n     informed that in the _Antiquities of Glastonbury_, published\r\n     by Hearne, 1722, p. LVIII, there is a medal, with the\r\n     reverse, of one of the Earl's ancestors in Queen Elizabeth's\r\n     time, which had escaped Evelyn. It was lent to Hearne by Sir\r\n     Philip Sydenham, who was at the expense of having the plate\r\n     engraved.]\r\n\r\nWhile this nobleman was the general theme of literary praise there\r\nlived a _Bibliomaniacal Triumvirate_ of the names of BAGFORD, MURRAY,\r\nand HEARNE: a triumvirate, perhaps not equalled, in the mere love of\r\nbook-collecting, by that which we mentioned a short time ago. At the\r\nhead, and the survivor of these three,[368] was Thomas Hearne; who,\r\nif I well remember, has been thus described by Pope, in his Dunciad,\r\nunder the character of Wormius:\r\n\r\n     But who is he, in closet close ypent,\r\n     Of sober face, with learned dust besprent?\r\n     Right well mine eyes arede the myster wight,\r\n     On parchment scraps y-fed, and WORMIUS hight.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 368: The former bibliomaniacal triumvirate is\r\n     noticed at p. 217, ante. We will now discuss the merits of\r\n     the above, _seriatim_. And first of JOHN BAGFORD, \"by\r\n     profession a bookseller; who frequently travelled into\r\n     Holland and other parts, in search of scarce books and\r\n     valuable prints, and brought a vast number into this\r\n     kingdom, the greater part of which were purchased by the\r\n     Earl of Oxford. He had been in his younger days a shoemaker;\r\n     and for the many curiosities wherewith he enriched the\r\n     famous library of Dr. John More, Bishop of Ely, his Lordship\r\n     got him admitted into the Charter House. He died in 1716,\r\n     aged 65; after his death, Lord Oxford purchased all his\r\n     collections and papers for his library: these are now in the\r\n     Harleian collection in the British Museum. In 1707 were\r\n     published, in the Philosophical transactions, his Proposals\r\n     for a General History of Printing.\"--Bowyer and Nichol's\r\n     _Origin of Printing_, pp. 164, 189, note. It has been my\r\n     fortune (whether good or bad remains to be proved) not only\r\n     to transcribe, and cause to be reprinted, the slender\r\n     Memorial of Printing in the Philosophical Transactions,\r\n     drawn up by Wanley for Bagford, but to wade through\r\n     _forty-two_ folio volumes, in which Bagford's materials for\r\n     a History of Printing are incorporated, in the British\r\n     Museum: and from these, I think I have furnished myself with\r\n     a pretty correct notion of the collector of them. Bagford\r\n     was the most hungry and rapacious of all book and print\r\n     collectors; and, in his ravages, he spared neither the most\r\n     delicate nor costly specimens. He seems always to have\r\n     expressed his astonishment at the most common productions;\r\n     and his paper in the Philosophical Transactions betrays such\r\n     simplicity and ignorance that one is astonished how my Lord\r\n     Oxford, and the learned Bishop of Ely, could have employed\r\n     so credulous a bibliographical forager. A modern collector\r\n     and lover of _perfect_ copies, will witness, with\r\n     shuddering, among Bagford's immense collection of\r\n     title-pages in the Museum, the frontispieces of the\r\n     Complutensian Polyglot, and Chauncy's History of\r\n     Hertfordshire, torn out to illustrate a History of Printing.\r\n     His enthusiasm, however, carried him through a great deal of\r\n     laborious toil; and he supplied in some measure, by this\r\n     qualification, the want of other attainments. His whole mind\r\n     was devoted to book-hunting; and his integrity and diligence\r\n     probably made his employers overlook his many failings. His\r\n     handwriting is scarcely legible, and his orthography is\r\n     still more wretched; but if he was ignorant, he was humble,\r\n     zealous, and grateful; and he has certainly done something\r\n     towards the accomplishment of that desirable object, an\r\n     accurate GENERAL HISTORY OF PRINTING. The preceding was\r\n     inserted in the _first edition_ of this work. It is\r\n     incumbent on me to say something more, and less declamatory,\r\n     of so extraordinary a character; and as my sources of\r\n     information are such as do not fall into the hands of the\r\n     majority of readers, I trust the prolixity of what follows,\r\n     appertaining to the aforesaid renowned bibliomaniac, will be\r\n     pardoned--at least by the lover of curious biographical\r\n     memoranda. My old friend, Tom Hearne, is my chief authority.\r\n     In the preface to that very scarce, but rather curious than\r\n     valuable, work, entitled _Guil. Roper Vita D. Thomæ Mori_,\r\n     1716, 8vo., we have the following brief notice of Bagford:\r\n     §. ix. \"Epistolas et Orationes excipit Anonymi Scriptoris\r\n     chronicon; quod idcirco Godstovianum appellare visum est,\r\n     quia in illud forte fortuna inciderim, quum, anno MDCCXV.\r\n     una cum JOANNÆ BAGFORDIO, amico egregio ad rudera Prioratûs\r\n     de Godstowe juxta Oxoniam animi recreandi gratia,\r\n     perambularem. De illo vero me prius certiorem fecerat ipse\r\n     Bagfordius, qui magno cum nostro moerore paullo post\r\n     Londini obiit, die nimirum quinto Maij anno MDCCXVI. quum\r\n     jam annum ætatis sexagessimum quintum inplerisset, ut è\r\n     litteris intelligo amici ingenio et humanitate ornati\r\n     Jacobei Sothebeii, junioris, qui, si quis alius, è\r\n     familiaribus erat Bagfordii. Virum enimvero ideo mihi quam\r\n     maxime hâc occasione lugendum est, quod amicum probitate et\r\n     modestia præditum amiserim, virumque cum primis diligentem\r\n     et peritum intercidisse tam certum sit quam quod\r\n     certissimum. Quamvis enim artes liberales nunquam\r\n     didicisset, vi tamen ingenii ductus, eruditus plane evasit;\r\n     et, ut quod verum est dicam, incredibile est quam feliciter\r\n     res abstrusas in historiis veteribus explicaverit, nodosque\r\n     paullo difficiliores ad artis typographicæ incunabula\r\n     spectantes solverit et expedierit. Expertus novi quod\r\n     scribo. Quotiescunque enim ipsum consului (et quidem id\r\n     sæpissime faciendum erat) perpetuo mihi aliter atque\r\n     exspectaveram satisfecit, observationis itidem nonnunquam\r\n     tales addens, quales antea neque mihi neque viris longe\r\n     doctioribus in mentem venerant. Quidni itaque virum magnum\r\n     fuisse pronunciarem, præcipue quum nostra sententia illi\r\n     soli magni sint censendi, qui recte agant, et sint vere boni\r\n     et virtute præditi?\"--_Præf._ pp. xxi., ii. In Hearne's\r\n     perface [Transcriber's Note: preface] to _Walter\r\n     Hemingford's_ history, Bagford is again briefly introduced:\r\n     \"At vero in hoc genere fragmenta colligendi omnes quidem\r\n     alios (quantum ego existimare possum) facile superavit\r\n     JOANNES BAGFORDIUS, de quo apud Hemingum, &c. Incredibile\r\n     est, quanta usus sit diligentia in laciniis veteribus\r\n     coacervandis. Imo in hoc labore quidem tantum versari\r\n     exoptabat quantum potuit, tantum autem re vera versabatur,\r\n     quantum ingenio (nam divino sane fruebatur) quantum mediocri\r\n     doctrina (nam neque ingenue, neque liberaliter, unquam fuit\r\n     educatus) quantum usu valuit,\" p. ciii. The reader here\r\n     finds a reference to what is said of Bagford, in the\r\n     _Hemingi Wigornensis Chartularium_; which, though copious,\r\n     is really curious and entertaining, and is forthwith\r\n     submitted to his consideration. \"It was therefore very\r\n     laudable in my friend, Mr. J. BAGFORD (who I think was born\r\n     in Fetter-lane, London) to employ so much of his time as he\r\n     did in collecting remains of antiquity. Indeed he was a man\r\n     of a very surprising genius, and had his education (for he\r\n     was first a shoe-maker, and afterwards for some time a\r\n     book-seller) been equal to his natural genius, he would have\r\n     proved a much greater man than he was. And yet, without this\r\n     education, he was certainly the greatest man in the world in\r\n     his way. I do not hear of any monument erected to his\r\n     memory, but 'twas not without reason that a worthy\r\n     gentleman, now living in London, designed the following\r\n     epitaph for him:\r\n\r\n          Hic. Sitvs. JOANNES. BAGFORDIVS.\r\n            Antiquarivs. Penitvs. Britannvs.\r\n          Cujvs. Nuda. Solertia. Aliorvm.\r\n            Vicit. Operosam. Diligentiam.\r\n          Obiit. Maii. v. A.D.

Posvit....\r\n\r\n     \"'Tis very remarkable that, in collecting, his care did not\r\n     extend itself to books and to fragments of books only; but\r\n     even to the very _Covers_, and to _Bosses_ and _Clasps_; and\r\n     all this that he might, with greater ease, compile the\r\n     History of Printing, which he had undertaken, but did not\r\n     finish. In this noble work he intended a Discourse about\r\n     _Binding Books_ (in which he might have improved what I have\r\n     said elsewhere about the ancient Æstels) and another about\r\n     the _Art of making Paper_, in both which his observations\r\n     were very accurate. Nay, his skill _in paper_ was so\r\n     exquisite that, at first view, he could tell the place\r\n     where, and the time when, any paper was made, though at\r\n     never so many years' distance. I well remember that, when I\r\n     was reading over a famous book of collections (written by\r\n     John Lawerne, Monk of Worcester, and now preserved) in the\r\n     Bodleian Library, Mr. Bagford came to me (as he would often\r\n     come thither on purpose to converse with me about\r\n     curiosities) and that he had no sooner seen the book, but he\r\n     presently described the time when, and the place where, the\r\n     paper of which it consists, was made. He was indefatigable\r\n     in his searches, and was so ambitious of seeing what he had\r\n     heard of, relating to his noble design, that he had made\r\n     several journies into Holland to see the famous books there.\r\n     Nor was he less thirsty after other antiquities, but, like\r\n     old John Stow, was for seeing himself, if possible (although\r\n     he travelled on foot), what had been related to him.\r\n     Insomuch that I cannot doubt, but were he now living, he\r\n     would have expressed a very longing desire of going to\r\n     Worcester, were it for no other reason but to be better\r\n     satisfied about the famous monumental stones mentioned by\r\n     Heming (_Chart, Wigorn._, p. 342), as he often declared a\r\n     most earnest desire of walking with me (though I was\r\n     diverted from going) to Guy's Cliff by Warwick, when I was\r\n     printing that most rare book called, _Joannis Rossi\r\n     Antiquarii Warwicensis Historia Regum Angliæ_. And I am apt\r\n     to think that he would have shewed as hearty an inclination\r\n     of going to Stening in Sussex, that being the place\r\n     (according to Asser's Life of Ælfred the Great) where K.\r\n     Ethelwulph (father of K. Alfred) was buried, though others\r\n     say it was at Winchester,\" &c. \"Mr. BAGFORD was as\r\n     communicative as he was knowing: so that some of the chief\r\n     curiosities in some of our best libraries are owing to him;\r\n     for which reason it was that the late _Bishop of Ely_, Dr.\r\n     MORE (who received so much from him), as an instance of\r\n     gratitude, procured him a place in the Charter-House. I wish\r\n     all places were as well bestowed. For as Mr. Bagford was,\r\n     without all dispute, a very worthy man, so, being a despiser\r\n     of money, he had not provided for the necessities of old\r\n     age. He never looked upon those as true philosophers that\r\n     aimed at heaping up riches, and, in that point, could never\r\n     commend that otherwise great man, Seneca, who had about two\r\n     hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling, at use in\r\n     Britain; the loan whereof had been thrust upon the Britains,\r\n     whether they would or no. He would rather extol such men as\r\n     a certain rector near Oxford, whose will is thus put down in\r\n     writing, by Richard Kedermister, the last abbot but one of\r\n     Winchcomb (_Leland Collect._ vol. vi., 168), in the margin\r\n     of a book (I lately purchased) called _Hieronymi Cardinalis\r\n     Vitas Patrum_, Lugd. MCCCCCII. 4to. Nihil habeo, nihil\r\n     debeo, benedicamus Domino. Testamentum cujusdam rectoris,\r\n     juxta Oxoniam decedentis circiter annum salutis, 1520.\" \"Nor\r\n     was Mr. Bagford versed only in our own old writers, but in\r\n     those likewise of other countries, particularly the Roman.\r\n     His skill in that part of the Roman history that immediately\r\n     relates to Britain is sufficiently evident from his curious\r\n     letter, printed at the beginning of Leland's Collectanea.\r\n     That he might be the better acquainted with the Roman\r\n     stations, and the several motions of the soldiers from one\r\n     place to another, he used to pick up coins, and would, upon\r\n     occasion, discourse handsomely, and very pertinently, about\r\n     them; yet he would keep none, but would give them to his\r\n     friends, telling them (for he was exemplarily modest and\r\n     humble) that he had neither learning nor sagacity enough to\r\n     explain and illustrate them, and that therefore it was more\r\n     proper they should be in the possession of some able\r\n     persons. He would have done any thing to retrieve a Roman\r\n     author, and would have given any price for so much as a\r\n     single fragment (not yet discovered) of the learned\r\n     commentaries, written by Agrippina, mother to Nero, touching\r\n     the fortunes of her house, which are (as I much fear) now\r\n     utterly lost, excepting the fragment or two cited out of\r\n     them by Pliny the elder and Cornelius Tacitus; as he would\r\n     also have stuck at no price for a grammar _printed at\r\n     Tavistock_, commonly called =The long Grammar=. When he went\r\n     abroad he was never idle, but if he could not meet with\r\n     things of a better character, he would divert himself with\r\n     looking over _Ballads_, and he was always mightily pleased\r\n     if he met with any that were old. Anthony à Wood made good\r\n     collections, with respect to ballads, but he was far outdone\r\n     by Mr. Bagford. Our modern ballads are, for the most part,\r\n     romantic; but the old ones contain matters of fact, and were\r\n     generally written by good scholars. In these old ones were\r\n     couched the transactions of our great heroes: they were a\r\n     sort of Chronicles. So that the wise founder of New College\r\n     permitted them to be sung, by the fellows of that college,\r\n     upon extraordinary days. In those times, the poets thought\r\n     they had done their duty when they had observed truth, and\r\n     put the accounts they undertook to write, into rhythm,\r\n     without extravagantly indulging their fancies. Nobody knew\r\n     this better than Mr. Bagford; for which reason he always\r\n     seemed almost ravished when he happened to light upon old\r\n     rhythms, though they might not, perhaps, be so properly\r\n     ranged under the title of ballads,\" &c., pp. 656-663. Being\r\n     unable to furnish a portrait of Bagford (although I took\r\n     some little trouble to procure one) I hope the reader--if\r\n     his patience be not quite exhausted--will endeavour to\r\n     console himself, in lieu thereof, with a specimen of\r\n     Bagford's epistolary composition; which I have faithfully\r\n     copied from the original among the _Sloanian MSS._, no.\r\n     4036, in the British Museum. It is written to Sir Hans\r\n     Sloane.\r\n\r\n     _From my Lodgings_, July 24, 1704.\r\n\r\n     WORTHY SIR,\r\n\r\n     Since you honoured me with your good company for seeing\r\n     printing and card-making, I thought it my duty to explain\r\n     myself to you per letter on this subject. Till you had seen\r\n     the whole process of card-making, I thought I could not so\r\n     well represent it unto you by writing--for this I take to be\r\n     the first manner of printing. In this short discouse\r\n     [Transcriber's Note: discourse] I have explained myself when\r\n     I design to treat of it in the famous subject of the Art of\r\n     Printing. It hath been the labour of several years past, and\r\n     if now I shall have assistance to midwife it into the world,\r\n     I shall be well satisfied for the sake of the curious. For\r\n     these 10 years past I have spared no cost in collecting\r\n     books on this subject, and likewise drafts of the effigies\r\n     of our famous printers, with other designs that will be\r\n     needful on this subject. If this short account of the design\r\n     of the whole shall give you any satisfaction, I shall esteem\r\n     my pains well bestowed. Hitherto, I have met with no\r\n     encouragement but from three reverend gentlemen of Bennet\r\n     College in Cambridge, who generously, of their own accord,\r\n     gave me 10 pound each, which is all I ever received of any\r\n     person whatsoever. It may indeed be imputed to my own\r\n     neglect, in not acquainting the learned with my design, but\r\n     modesty still keeps me silent. I hope your goodness will\r\n     pardon my impertinence. I shall be ready at all times to\r\n     give you any satisfaction you desire on this subject, who\r\n     am,\r\n\r\n     Honoured Sir,\r\n\r\n     Your most humble Servant to command,\r\n\r\n     JO. BAGFORD.\r\n\r\n     _For the Worthy Sir Hans Slone_ [Transcriber's Note:\r\n     Sloane].\r\n\r\n     And now it only remains to close the whole of this\r\n     BAGFORDIANA by the following unique communication. One of\r\n     Bagford's friends sent him this letter with the subjoined\r\n     device:--\"_For my Lovinge friend Mr. Jno. Bagford._--You\r\n     having shewed me so many rebuses, as I was returning home, I\r\n     thought of one for you--a bagge, and below that, a fourd or\r\n     passable water.\" (_Harl. MS._, no. 5910.)\r\n\r\n     [Illustration]\r\n\r\n     I wish it were in my power to collect information, equally\r\n     acceptable with the foregoing, respecting the above-named\r\n     JOHN MURRAY; but Hearne, who was his intimate friend, has\r\n     been very sparing in his anecdotes of him, having left us\r\n     but a few desultory notices, written chiefly in the Latin\r\n     language. The earliest mention of him that I find is the\r\n     following: \"Verum illud præcipue mentionem meretur, quod\r\n     mutuo accepi, schedula una et altera jam excusa, á JOANNE\r\n     MURARIO Londinensi, rei antiquariæ perscrutatore diligenti,\r\n     cui eo nomine gratias ago.\" \"Denique subdidi descriptionem\r\n     fenestrarum depictarum ecclesiæ parochialis de Fairford in\r\n     agro Glocestriensi, è schedula quam mutuo sumpsi ab amico\r\n     supra laudato Johanne Murrario, qui per literas etiam\r\n     certiorem me fecit è codice quodam vetusto MS. fuisse\r\n     extractum. Neque dubito quin hic idem fuerit Codex quem olim\r\n     in ecclesia de Fairford adservatum surripuisse nebulonem\r\n     quempiam mihi significavit ecclesiæ ædituus, vir simplex,\r\n     necnon ætate et scientia venerandus.\" Præf: p. XXII. _Guil.\r\n     Roperi Vita Thomæ Mori_, 1716, 8vo., edit. Hearne. There is\r\n     another slight mention of Murray, by Hearne, in the latter's\r\n     edition of _Thom. Caii. Vindic. Antiq. Acad. Oxon_, vol.\r\n     ii., 803-4--where he discourses largely upon the former's\r\n     copy of _Rastel's Pastyme of People_: a book which will be\r\n     noticed by me very fully on a future occasion. At present,\r\n     it may suffice to observe that a perfect copy of it is\r\n     probably the rarest English book in existence. There is a\r\n     curious copper plate print of Murray, by Vertue, in which\r\n     our bibliomaniac's right arm is resting upon some books\r\n     entitled \"_Hearne's Works, Sessions Papers, Tryals of\r\n     Witches_.\" Beneath is this inscription:\r\n\r\n          _Hoh Maister John Murray of Sacomb,\r\n          The Works of old Time to collect was his pride,\r\n            Till Oblivion dreaded his Care:\r\n          Regardless of Friends, intestate he dy'd,\r\n            So the Rooks and the Crows were his Heir._\r\n\r\n          G.N.\r\n\r\n     Of the above-mentioned THOMAS BRITTON, I am enabled to\r\n     present a very curious and interesting account, from a work\r\n     published by Hearne, of no very ordinary occurrence, and in\r\n     the very words of Hearne himself. It is quite an unique\r\n     picture. \"Before I dismiss this subject, I must beg leave to\r\n     mention, and to give a short account of, one that was\r\n     intimately acquainted with Mr. Bagford, and was also a great\r\n     man, though of but ordinary education. The person I mean is\r\n     Mr. THOS. BRITTON, the famous _Musical Small Coal Man_, who\r\n     was born at or near Higham Ferrers in Northamptonshire.\r\n     Thence he went to London, where he bound himself apprentice\r\n     to a small coal man in St. John Baptist's Street. After he\r\n     had served his full time of seven years, his master gave him\r\n     a sum of money not to set up. Upon this, Tom went into\r\n     Northamptonshire again, and after he had spent his money, he\r\n     returned again to London, set up the _small coal trade_\r\n     (notwithstanding his master was still living) and withall,\r\n     he took a stable, and turned it into a house, which stood\r\n     the next door to the little gate of St. John's of Jerusalem,\r\n     next Clerkenwell Green. Some time after he had settled here,\r\n     he became acquainted with Dr. Garenciers, his near\r\n     neighbour, by which means he became an excellent chymist,\r\n     and perhaps, he performed such things in that profession, as\r\n     had never been done before, with little cost and charge, by\r\n     the help of a moving elaboratory, that was contrived and\r\n     built by himself, which was much admired by all of that\r\n     faculty that happened to see it; insomuch that a certain\r\n     gentleman in Wales was so much taken with it that he was at\r\n     the expense of carrying him down into that country, on\r\n     purpose to build him such another, which Tom performed to\r\n     the gentleman's very great satisfaction, and for the same he\r\n     received of him a very handsome and generous gratuity.\r\n     Besides his great skill in chymistry, he was as famous for\r\n     his knowledge in the _Theory of Music_; in the practical\r\n     part of which Faculty he was likewise very considerable. He\r\n     was so much addicted to it that he pricked with his own hand\r\n     (very neatly and accurately), and left behind him, a\r\n     valuable collection of music, mostly pricked by himself,\r\n     which was sold upon his death for near a hundred pounds. Not\r\n     to mention the excellent collection of PRINTED BOOKS, that\r\n     he also left behind him, both of chemistry and music.\r\n     Besides these books that he left behind him, he had, some\r\n     years before his death, sold by auction a _noble collection\r\n     of books_, most of them in the _Rosacrucian Faculty_ (of\r\n     which he was a great admirer): whereof there is a printed\r\n     catalogue extant (as there is of those that were sold after\r\n     his death), which I have often looked over with no small\r\n     surprize and wonder, and particularly for the great number\r\n     of MSS. in the before mentioned faculties that are specified\r\n     in it. He had, moreover, a considerable collection of\r\n     musical instruments, which were sold for fourscore pounds\r\n     upon his death, which happened in September 1714, being\r\n     upwards of threescore years of age; and (he) lyes buried in\r\n     the church-yard of Clerkenwell, without monument or\r\n     inscription: being attended to his grave, in a very solemn\r\n     and decent manner, by a great concourse of people,\r\n     especially of such as frequented the Musical club, that was\r\n     kept up for many years at his own charges (he being a man of\r\n     a very generous and liberal spirit) at his own little cell.\r\n     He appears by the print of him (done since his death) to\r\n     have been a man of an ingenuous countenance and of a\r\n     sprightly temper. It also represents him as a comely person,\r\n     as indeed he was; and withal, there is a modesty expressed\r\n     in it every way agreeable to him. Under it are these verses,\r\n     which may serve instead of an epitaph:\r\n\r\n          Tho' mean thy rank, yet in thy humble cell\r\n          Did gentle peace and arts unpurchas'd dwell;\r\n          Well pleas'd Apollo thither led his train,\r\n          And music warbled in her sweetest strain.\r\n          Cyllenius, so, as fables tell, and Jove,\r\n          Came willing guests to poor PHILEMON'S grove.\r\n          Let useless pomp behold, and blush to find\r\n          So low a station, such a liberal mind.\r\n\r\n     In short, he was an extraordinary and very valuable man,\r\n     much admired by the gentry; even those of the best quality,\r\n     and by all others of the more inferior rank, that had any\r\n     manner of regard for probity, sagacity, diligence, and\r\n     humility. I say humility, because, though he was so much\r\n     famed for his knowledge, and might, therefore, have lived\r\n     very reputably without his trade, yet he continued it to his\r\n     death, not thinking it to be at all beneath him. Mr. BAGFORD\r\n     and he used frequently to converse together, and when they\r\n     met _they seldom parted very soon_. Their conversation was\r\n     very often about OLD MSS. and the havock made of them. They\r\n     both agreed to retrieve what fragments of antiquity they\r\n     could, and, upon that occasion, they would frequently divert\r\n     themselves in talking of OLD CHRONICLES, which both loved to\r\n     read, though, among our more late Chronicles printed in\r\n     English, Isaackson's was what they chiefly preferred for a\r\n     general knowledge of things; a book which was much esteemed\r\n     also by those two eminent Chronologers, Bishop Lloyd and Mr.\r\n     Dodwell. By the way, I cannot but observe that Isaackson's\r\n     Chronicle is really, for the most part, Bishop Andrews's;\r\n     Isaackson being amanuensis to the bishop.\" _Hemingi\r\n     Chartular. Eccles. Wigornien._, vol. ii., 666-9, Edit.\r\n     Hearne. See also, _Robert of Glocester's Chronicle_, vol.\r\n     i., p. LXXII. We will close our account of this perfectly\r\n     _unique_ bibliomaniac by subjoining the title of the\r\n     _Catalogue of his Books_; for which I am indebted to the\r\n     ever-active and friendly assistance of Mr. Heber. The volume\r\n     is so rare that the late Mr. Reed told Mr. H. he had never\r\n     seen another copy: but another has recently been sold, and\r\n     is now in the curious collection of Mr. R. Baker. \"The\r\n     Library of Mr. THOMAS BRITTON, Small-coal man, Deceas'd:\r\n     who, at his own charge, kept up a Concort of Musick above 40\r\n     years, in his little Cottage. Being a curious Collection of\r\n     every Ancient and Uncommon book in Divinity, History,\r\n     Physick, Chemistry, Magick, &c.

The third and last\r\n     character above mentioned, as making this illustrious\r\n     bibliomaniacal triumvirate complete, is THOMAS HEARNE. That\r\n     Pope, in the verses which Lysander has quoted, meant this\r\n     distinguished antiquary seems hardly to be questioned; and\r\n     one wonders at the Jesuitical note of Warburton, in striving\r\n     to blow the fumes of the poet's satire into a different\r\n     direction. They must settle upon poor Hearne's head: for\r\n     WANLEY'S antiquarian talents were equally beyond the touch\r\n     of satire and the criticism of the satirist. Warton has,\r\n     accordingly, admitted that HEARNE was represented under the\r\n     character of WORMIUS; and he defends the character of Hearne\r\n     very justly against the censures of Pope. His eulogy will be\r\n     presently submitted to the reader. Gibbon, in his\r\n     _Posthumous Works_, vol. ii., 711, has aimed a deadly blow\r\n     at the literary reputation of Hearne; and an admirer of this\r\n     critic and historian, as well as an excellent judge of\r\n     antiquarian pursuits, has followed up Gibbon's mode of\r\n     attack in a yet more merciless manner. He calls him \"Thomas\r\n     Hearne, of black-letter memory, _carbone notandus_\"--\"a\r\n     weaker man (says he) never existed, as his prefaces, so\r\n     called, lamentably show.\" He continues in this hard-hearted\r\n     strain: but I have too much humanity to make further\r\n     extracts. He admits, however, the utility of most of\r\n     Hearne's publications--\"of which he was forced to publish a\r\n     few copies, at an extravagant subscription.\" The remarks of\r\n     this (anonymous) writer, upon the neglect of the cultivation\r\n     of ENGLISH HISTORY, and upon the want of valuable editions\r\n     of OUR OLD HISTORIANS, are but too just, and cannot be too\r\n     attentively perused. See _Gentleman's Magazine_, vol. 58,\r\n     pt. 1, 196-8 (A.D. 1788). Thus far in deterioration of poor\r\n     Hearne's literary fame. Let us now listen to writers of a\r\n     more courteous strain of observation. Prefixed to Tanner's\r\n     _Bibliotheca Britannico-Hibernica_, there is a preface, of\r\n     which Dr. Wilkins is the reputed author. The whole of\r\n     Hearne's publications are herein somewhat minutely\r\n     criticised, and their merits and demerits slightly\r\n     discussed. It is difficult to collect the critic's summary\r\n     opinion upon Hearne's editorial labours; but he concludes\r\n     thus: \"Quia autem leporis est mortuis insultare leonibus,\r\n     cineres celeberrimi hujus et olim mihi amicissimi viri\r\n     turbare, neutiquam in animum inducere possum,\" p. xlvii. Mr.\r\n     Gough, in his _British Topography_, vol. ii., p. 579, calls\r\n     Hearne an \"acute observer;\" but, unluckily, the subject to\r\n     which the reader's attention is here directed discovers our\r\n     antiquary to have been in error. J. Warton, in the passage\r\n     before alluded to, observes: \"In consideration of the many\r\n     very accurate and very elegant editions which Hearne\r\n     published of our valuable old chronicles, which shed such a\r\n     light on English history, he (Hearne) ought not to have been\r\n     so severely lashed as in these bitter lines,\" (quoted in the\r\n     text, p. 327, ante) _Pope's Works_, edit. Bowles; vol. v.,\r\n     232. Let the reader consult also Dr. Pegge's _Anonymiana_,\r\n     in the passages referred to, in the truly valuable index\r\n     attached to it, concerning Hearne. Thus much, I submit, may\r\n     be fairly said of our antiquary's labours. That the greater\r\n     part of them are truly useful, and absolutely necessary for\r\n     a philological library, must on all sides be admitted. I\r\n     will mention only the _Chronicles of Langtoft and Robert of\r\n     Gloucester_; _Adam de Domerham, de rebus Glastoniensibus_;\r\n     _Gulielmus Neubrigensis_; _Forduni Scotichronicon_; and all\r\n     his volumes appertaining to _Regal Biography_:--these are,\r\n     surely, publications of no mean importance. Hearne's\r\n     prefaces and appendices are gossiping enough; sometimes,\r\n     however, they repay the labour of perusal by curious and\r\n     unlooked-for intelligence. Yet it must be allowed that no\r\n     literary cook ever enriched his dishes with such little\r\n     piquant sauce, as did Hearne: I speak only of their\r\n     _intrinsic_ value, for they had a very respectable\r\n     exterior--what Winstanley says of Ogilvey's publications\r\n     being, applicable enough to Hearne's;--they were printed on\r\n     \"special good paper, and in a very good letter.\" We will now\r\n     say a few words relative to Hearne's habits of study and\r\n     living--taken from his own testimony. In the preface\r\n     prefixed to _Roper's Life of Sir Thomas More_, p. xix.\r\n     (edit. 1716), he describes himself \"as leading the life of\r\n     an ascetic.\" In the preface to the _Annals of Dunstable\r\n     Priory_, his bibliographical diligence is evinced by his\r\n     saying he had \"turned over every volume in the Bodleian\r\n     Library.\" In one of his prefaces (to which I am not able\r\n     just now to refer) he declares that he was born--like our\r\n     British tars--\"for action:\" and indeed his activity was\r\n     sufficiently demonstrated; for sometimes he would set about\r\n     transcribing for the press papers which had just been put\r\n     into his hands. Thus, in the _Antiquities of Glastonbury_,\r\n     p. 326, he writes, \"the two following old evidences were\r\n     lent me _to-day_ by my friend the Hon. Benedict Leonard\r\n     Calvert, Esq.\" His excessive regard to fidelity of\r\n     transcription is, among many other evidences that may be\r\n     brought forward, attested in the following passage: \"Have\r\n     taken particular care (saith Mr. Harcourt, in his letter to\r\n     me from Aukenvyke, Sep. 25, 1734) in the copying; well\r\n     knowing your exactness.\" _Benedict Abbas_, vol ii., 870. But\r\n     this servility of transcription was frequently the cause of\r\n     multiplying, by propagating, errors. If Hearne had seen the\r\n     word \"faith\" thus disjointed--\"fay the\"--he would have\r\n     adhered to this error, for \"faythe.\" As indeed he has\r\n     committed a similar one, in the _Battle of Agincourt_, in\r\n     the appendix to Thomas de Elmham: for he writes \"breth\r\n     reneverichone\"--instead of \"brethren everichone\"--as Mr.\r\n     Evans has properly printed it, in his recent edition of his\r\n     father's _Collection of Old Ballads_, vol. ii., 334. But\r\n     this may be thought trifling. It is certainly not here meant\r\n     to justify capriciousness of copying; but surely an obvious\r\n     corruption of reading may be restored to its genuine state:\r\n     unless, indeed, we are resolved to consider antiquity and\r\n     perfection as synonymous terms. But there are some traits in\r\n     Hearne's character which must make us forgive and forget\r\n     this blind adherence to the errors of antiquity. He was so\r\n     warm a lover of every thing in the shape of a BOOK that, in\r\n     the preface to _Alured of Beverley_, pp. v. vi., he says\r\n     that he jumped almost out of his skin for joy, on reading a\r\n     certain MS. which Thomas Rawlinson sent to him (\"vix credi\r\n     potest qua voluptate, qua animi alacritate, perlegerim,\"\r\n     &c.). Similar feelings possessed him on a like occasion:\r\n     \"When the pious author (of the _Antiquities of Glastonbury_)\r\n     first put it (the MS.) into my hands, I read it over with as\r\n     much delight as I have done anything whatsoever upon the\r\n     subject of antiquity, and I was earnest with him to print\r\n     it,\" p. lxxviii. Hearne's horror of book-devastations is\r\n     expressed upon a variety of occasions: and what will\r\n     reconcile him to a great portion of _modern_ readers--and\r\n     especially of those who condescend to read this account of\r\n     him--his attachment to the black-letter was marvelously\r\n     enthusiastic! Witness his pathetic appeal to the English\r\n     nation, in the 26th section of his preface to _Robert of\r\n     Gloucester's Chronicle_, where he almost predicts the\r\n     extinction of \"right good\" literature, on the disappearance\r\n     of the _black-letter_! And here let us draw towards the\r\n     close of these HEARNEANA, by contemplating a wood-cut\r\n     portrait of this illustrious Bibliomaniac; concerning whose\r\n     life and works the reader should peruse the well-known\r\n     volumes published at Oxford in 1772, 8vo.: containing the\r\n     biographical memoirs of Leland, Bale, Hearne, and Wood.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: OBIIT MDCCXXXV: ÆTATIS SUÆ LVII.\r\n\r\n     _Deut. xxxii: 7. Remember the days of old._]\r\n\r\n     The library of Hearne was sold in February, 1736, by Osborne\r\n     the book-seller; \"the lowest price being marked in each\r\n     book.\" The title-page informs us of what all bibliomaniacs\r\n     will be disposed to admit the truth, that the collection\r\n     contained \"a very great variety of uncommon books, and\r\n     scarce ever to be met withal,\" &c. There is, at bottom, a\r\n     small wretched portrait of Hearne, with this well known\r\n     couplet subjoined:\r\n\r\n          Pox on't quoth _Time_ to _Thomas Hearne_,\r\n          Whatever I _forget_ you learn.\r\n\r\n     Let the modern collector of Chronicles turn his eye towards\r\n     the 15th page of this catalogue--nos. 384, 390--and see\r\n     what \"compleat and very fair\" copies of these treasures were\r\n     incorporated in Hearne's extensive library!]\r\n\r\nA little volume of book chit-chat might be written upon the marvellous\r\ndiscovesies [Transcriber's Note: discoveries] and voluminous\r\ncompilations of Bagford and Hearne: and to these, we may add another\r\n_unique_ bibliomaniac, who will go down to posterity under the\r\ndistinguished, and truly enviable, title of \"_The Musical Small-Coal\r\nMan_;\" I mean, master THOMAS BRITTON. Yes, Lisardo; while we give to\r\nthe foregoing characters their full share of merit and praise; we\r\nadmit that Bagford's personal activity and manual labour have hardly\r\nbeen equalled--while we allow John Murray to have looked with sharper\r\neyes after black-letter volumes than almost any of his predecessors\r\nor successors--while we grant Thomas Hearne a considerable portion of\r\nscholarship, an inflexible integrity, as well as indefatigable\r\nindustry, and that his works are generally interesting, both from the\r\nartless style in which they are composed, and the intrinstic utility\r\nof the greater part of them, yet let our admiration be [Transcriber's\r\nNote: superfluous 'be'] \"be screwed to its sticking place,\" when we\r\nthink upon the wonderous genius of the aforesaid Thomas Britton; who,\r\nin the midst of his coal cellars, could practise upon \"fiddle and\r\nflute,\" or collate his curious volumes; and throwing away, with the\r\nagility of a harlequin, his sombre suit of business-cloths, could put\r\non his velvet coat and bag-wig, and receive his concert visitors, at\r\nthe stair-head, with the politeness of a Lord of the Bedchamber!\r\n\r\nLOREN. In truth, a marvellous hero was this _Small-Coal Man_! Have you\r\nmany such characters to notice?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Not many of exactly the same stamp. Indeed, I suspect that\r\nHearne, from his love of magnifying the simple into the marvellous,\r\nhas a little caricatured the picture. But Murray seems to have been a\r\nquiet unaffected character; passionately addicted to old books of\r\nwhatever kind they chanced to be; and, in particular, most\r\nenthusiastically devoted to a certain old English Chronicle, entitled\r\n_Rastell's Pastime of (the) People_.\r\n\r\nPHIL. I observed a notification of the re-appearance of this Chronicle\r\nin some of the Magazines or Reviews: but I hope, for the benefit of\r\ngeneral readers, the orthography will be modernized.\r\n\r\nLOREN. I hope, for the sake of consistency with former similar\r\npublications,[369] the ancient garb will not be thrown aside. It would\r\nbe like--what Dr. Johnson accuses Pope of having committed--\"clothing\r\nHomer with Ovidian graces.\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 369: The ANCIENT CHONICLES of the history of our\r\n     country are in a progressive state of being creditably\r\n     reprinted, with a strict adherence to the old phraseology.\r\n     Of these Chronicles, the following have already made their\r\n     appearance: HOLINSHED, 1807, 4to., 6 vols.; HALL, 1809,\r\n     4to.; GRAFTON, 1809, 4to., 2 vols.; FABIAN, 1811, 4to. This\r\n     latter is not a mere reprint of the first edition of Fabian,\r\n     but has, at the bottom, the various readings of the\r\n     subsequent impressions. The index is copious and valuable.\r\n     Indeed, all these re-impressions have good indexes. The\r\n     public will hear, with pleasure, that ARNOLD, HARDING, and\r\n     LORD BERNERS' translation of FROISSARD, and RASTELL, are\r\n     about to bring up the rear of these popular Chroniclers.]\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Much may be said on both sides of the question. But why are we\r\nabout to make learned dissertations upon the old English Chronicles?\r\n\r\nLIS. Proceed, and leave the old chroniclers to settle the matter\r\nthemselves. Who is the next bibliomaniac deserving of particular\r\ncommendation?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. As we have sometimes classed our bibliomaniacs in tribes, let\r\nme now make you acquainted with another _Trio_, of like renown in the\r\nbook-way: I mean Anstis, Lewis, and Ames. Of these in their turn.\r\n\r\nANSTIS[370] stands deservedly the first in the list; for he was, in\r\nevery respect, a man of thorough benevolent character, as well as a\r\nwriter of taste and research. I do not know of any particulars\r\nconnected with his library that merit a distinct recital; but he is\r\nintroduced here from his connection with the two latter\r\nbibliographers. LEWIS[371] is known to us, both as a topographer and\r\nbibliographical antiquary. His _Life of Caxton_ has been reprinted\r\nwith additions and corrections; and, in particular, his edition of\r\n_Wicliffe's New Testament_ has been recently put forth by the Rev. Mr.\r\nBaber, in a handsome quarto volume, with valuable emendations. Lewis\r\nwas a sharp censurer of Hearne, and was somewhat jealous of the\r\ntypographical reputation of Ames. But his integrity and moral\r\ncharacter, as well as his love of rare and curious books, has secured\r\nfor him a durable reputation. Of AMES, and here--though a little out\r\nof order--I may add HERBERT--the public has already heard probably\r\n\"more than enough.\" They were both, undoubtedly, men of extraordinary\r\nmental vigour and bodily activity in the darling pursuit which they\r\ncultivated.[372] Indeed, Herbert deserves high commendation; for while\r\nhe was rearing, with his own hands, a lofty pyramid of typographical\r\nfame, he seems to have been unconscious of his merits; and, possessing\r\nthe most natural and diffident character imaginable, he was always\r\nconjuring up supposed cases of vanity and arrogance, which had no\r\nfoundation whatever but in the reveries of a timid imagination. His\r\n_Typographical Antiquities_ are a mass of useful, but occasionally\r\nuninteresting, information. They are as a vast plain, wherein the\r\ntraveller sees nothing, immediately, which is beautiful or inviting;\r\nfew roses, or cowslips, or daisies; but let him persevere, and walk\r\nonly a little way onward, and he will find, in many a shelter'd\r\nrecess, \"flowers of all hue,\" and herbs of all qualities: so that\r\nfragrance and salubrity are not wanting in this said plain, which has\r\nbeen thus depicted in a style so marvellously metaphorical!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 370: The reader will be pleased to consult the\r\n     account of Earl Pembroke, p. 325, ante, where he will find a\r\n     few traits of the bibliomaniacal character of ANSTIS. He is\r\n     here informed, from the same authority, that when Anstis\r\n     \"acquainted BAGFORD that he would find in Rymer a commission\r\n     granted to Caxton, appointing him ambassador to the Duchess\r\n     of Burgundy, he (Bagford) was transported with joy.\" Of\r\n     HEARNE he thus speaks: \"I am ashamed that Mr. Hearne hath\r\n     made so many mistakes about the translation of _Boetius,\r\n     printed at Tavistock_; which book I had, and gave it to the\r\n     Duke of Bedford.\" But in another letter (to Lewis) Anstis\r\n     says, \"I lent this book to one Mr. Ryder, who used me\r\n     scurvily, by presenting it, without my knowledge, to the\r\n     Duke of Bedford.\" There are some curious particulars in this\r\n     letter about the abbey of Tavistock. Anstis's _Order of the\r\n     Garter_ is a valuable book; and will one day, I\r\n     prognosticate, retrieve the indifferent credit it now\r\n     receives in the book-market. The author loved rare and\r\n     curious volumes dearly; and was, moreover, both liberal and\r\n     prompt in his communications. The reader will draw his own\r\n     conclusions on Anstis's comparative merit with Lewis and\r\n     Ames, when he reaches the end of the second note after the\r\n     present one.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 371: Concerning the Rev. JOHN LEWIS, I am enabled\r\n     to lay before the reader some particulars now published for\r\n     the first time, and of a nature by no means uninteresting to\r\n     the lovers of literary anecdote. His printed works, and his\r\n     bibliographical character, together with his conduct towards\r\n     Ames, have been already sufficiently described to the\r\n     public: _Typographical Antiquities_, vol. i., 30-3. And\r\n     first, the aforesaid reader and lovers may peruse the\r\n     following extract from an original letter by Lewis to Ames:\r\n     \"I have no other design, in being so free with you, than to\r\n     serve you, by doing all I can to promote your credit and\r\n     reputation. I take it, that good sense and judgment,\r\n     attended with care and accuracy in making and sorting a\r\n     collection, suits every one's palate: and that they must\r\n     have none at all who are delighted with trifles and play\r\n     things fit only for fools and children: such, for the most\r\n     part, as THOMAS HEARNE dished out for his chaps, among whom\r\n     I was so silly as to rank myself.\" Again, to the same\r\n     person, he thus makes mention of LORD OXFORD and Hearne: \"I\r\n     can truly say I never took ill any thing which you have\r\n     written to me: but heartily wish you well to succeed in the\r\n     execution of your projects. I han't sense to see, by the\r\n     death of Lord Oxford, how much more you are likely to make\r\n     your account better. But time will shew. I don't understand\r\n     what you mean by his having a love to surprize people with\r\n     his vast communications. Dr. R(awlinson, qu.?) tells me he\r\n     knew nobody who had so free a use of his Lordship's rarities\r\n     as T. Hearne, a sure proof of the exactness and solidity of\r\n     his Lordship's judgment. But Hearne answered, perhaps, his\r\n     Lordship's design of making the world have a very great\r\n     opinion of his collections, and setting an inestimable value\r\n     on them. And this Hearne attempted; but his daubing is, I\r\n     think, too coarse, and the smoke of his incense troublesome\r\n     and suffocating.\" But it is to the loan of a copy of Lewis's\r\n     folio edition of the _History of the Translations of the\r\n     Bible_, belonging to my friend Mr. G.V. Neunburg, that I am\r\n     indebted for the following further, and more interesting,\r\n     particulars. This valuable copy, illustrated with some rare\r\n     prints, and charged with numerous MS. memoranda, contains\r\n     some original letters to Lewis by the famous Dr. White\r\n     Kennet, Bishop of Peterborough: from which these extracts\r\n     are taken. \"Jan. 23, 1720-1. Dear Sir; I thank you for your\r\n     kind acceptance of the advice to my clergy: well meant, I\r\n     pray God well applied.

I am not\r\n     surprised that a man of dignity, near you, should be jealous\r\n     of publishing an impartial account of that good old\r\n     evangelical author, &c. I have a mighty veneration for\r\n     Wicliff, and am the more angry with Mr. Russell for\r\n     deceiving the world in his promise of the Bible, after\r\n     proposals given and money taken. But he has in other\r\n     respects behaved so very basely that, forgiving him, I have\r\n     done with him for ever. I would not have you discouraged, by\r\n     an ungrateful world, or by a sharp bookseller. Go on, and\r\n     serve truth and peace what you can, and God prosper your\r\n     labours.\" Signed \"Wh.

I pray God bless\r\n     your labours and reward them.\" Several letters follow, in\r\n     which this amiable prelate and learned antiquary sends Lewis\r\n     a good deal of valuable information for his proposed second\r\n     edition of the Life of Wicliffe; but which was never put to\r\n     press. One more extract only from the Bishop of\r\n     Peterborough, and we bid farewell to the Rev. John Lewis: a\r\n     very respectable bibliomaniac. \"Rev. Sir; In respect to you\r\n     and your good services to the church and our holy religion,\r\n     I think fit to acquaint you that, in the _Weekly Journal_,\r\n     published this day, Oct. 28 (1721), by _Mr. Mist_, there is\r\n     a scandalous advertisement subscribed M. Earbury, beginning\r\n     thus: 'Whereas a pretended _Vindication of John Wickliffe_\r\n     has been published under the name of one Lewis of Margate,\r\n     by the incitement, as the preface asserts, of the Archbishop\r\n     of Canterbury, and in the same I am injuriously reflected\r\n     upon as a scurrilous writer, this is to inform the public\r\n     that I shall reserve the author for a more serious whipping\r\n     in my leisure hours, and in the meantime give him a short\r\n     correction for his benefit, if he has grace and sense to\r\n     take it'--and ending thus--'Why does this author persuade\r\n     the world the late Archbishop of Canterbury could have any\r\n     veneration for the memory of one who asserts God ought to\r\n     obey the devil; or that he could be desirous to open the\r\n     impure fountains from whence the filth of Bangorianism has\r\n     been conveyed to us? M. EARBURY.\" \"I confess (proceeds the\r\n     bishop) I don't know that, in the worst of causes, there has\r\n     appeared a more ignorant, insolent, and abandoned writer\r\n     than this Matth. Earbury. Whether you are to answer, or not\r\n     to answer, the F. according to his folly, I must leave to\r\n     your discretion. Yet I cannot but wish you would revise the\r\n     Life of Wickliffe; and, in the preface, justly complain of\r\n     the spiteful injuries done to his memory, and, through his\r\n     sides, to our Reformation. I have somewhat to say to you on\r\n     that head, if you think to resume it. I am, in the mean\r\n     time, your affectionate friend and brother, WH. PETESBOR.\"]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 372: It is unnecessary for me to add any thing\r\n     here to the copious details respecting these eminent\r\n     bibliomaniacs, AMES and HERBERT, which have already been\r\n     presented to the public in the first volume of the new\r\n     edition of the _Typographical Antiquities_ of our own\r\n     country. See also p. 66, ante; and the note respecting the\r\n     late GEORGE STEEVENS, post.]\r\n\r\nBy mentioning Herbert in the present place, I have a little inverted\r\nthe order of my narrative. A crowd of distinguished bibliomaniacs, in\r\nfancy's eye, is thronging around me, and demanding a satisfactory\r\nmemorial of their deeds.\r\n\r\nLOREN. Be not dismayed, Lysander. If any one, in particular, looks\r\n\"frowningly\" upon you, leave him to me, and he shall have ample\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. I wish, indeed, you would rid me of a few of these\r\nbook-madmen. For, look yonder, what a commanding attitude THOMAS\r\nBAKER[373] assumes!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 373: THOMAS BAKER was a learned antiquary in most\r\n     things respecting _Typography_ and _Bibliography_; and seems\r\n     to have had considerable influence with that distinguished\r\n     corps, composed of Hearne, Bagford, Middleton, Anstis, and\r\n     Ames, &c. His life has been written by the Rev. Robert\r\n     Masters, Camb., 1784, 8vo.; and from the \"Catalogue of\r\n     forty-two folio volumes of MS. collections by Mr.\r\n     Baker\"--given to the library of St. John's College,\r\n     Cambridge--which the biographer has printed at the end of\r\n     the volume--there is surely sufficient evidence to warrant\r\n     us in concluding that the above-mentioned Thomas Baker was\r\n     no ordinary bibliomaniac. To Hearne in particular (and\r\n     indeed to almost every respectable author who applied to\r\n     him) he was kind and communicative; hence he is frequently\r\n     named by the former in terms of the most respectful\r\n     admiration: thus--\"Vir amicissimus, educatus optime,\r\n     emendatus vitâ, doctrinâ clarus, moribus singularis et\r\n     perjucundus, exemplum antiquitatis, cujus judicio plurimum\r\n     esse tribuendum mecum fatebuntur litterati:\" _Vita Mori_, p.\r\n     XVIII. In his preface to the _Antiquities of Glastonbury_,\r\n     p. CXXX., Hearne calls him \"that great man;\" and again, in\r\n     his _Walter Hemingford_, vol. i., p. XVII.--\"amicus\r\n     eruditissimus, mihi summe colendus; is nempe, qui è scriniis\r\n     suis MSS. tam multa meam in gratiam deprompsit.\" Indeed,\r\n     Hearne had good occasion to speak well of the treasures of\r\n     Baker's \"_scrinia_;\" as the Appendix to his _Thomas de\r\n     Elmham_ alone testifies. Of Baker's abilities and private\r\n     worth, we have the testimonies of Middleton (_Origin of\r\n     Printing_, p. 5) and Warburton. The latter thus mentions\r\n     him: \"Good old Mr. Baker, of St John's College, has indeed,\r\n     been very obliging. The people of St. John's almost adore\r\n     the man.\" _Masters's Life of Baker_, p. 94. This authority\r\n     also informs us that \"Mr. Baker had, for many years before\r\n     his death, been almost a recluse, and seldom went farther\r\n     than the college walks, unless to a coffee-house in an\r\n     evening, after chapel, where he commonly spent an hour with\r\n     great chearfulness, conversing with a select number of his\r\n     friends and acquaintance upon literary subjects,\" p. 108.\r\n     Every thing the most amiable, and, I had almost said,\r\n     enviable, is here said of the virtues of his head and heart;\r\n     and that this venerable bibliomaniac should have reached his\r\n     80th year is at least a demonstration that tarrying amongst\r\n     folios and octavos, from morn till night (which Baker used\r\n     to do, in St. John's Library, for nearly 20 years together),\r\n     does not unstring the nerves, or dry up the juices, of the\r\n     human frame. Yet a little further extension of this note,\r\n     gentle reader, and then we bid adieu to Thomas Baker, of\r\n     ever respectable book-memory. Among the MSS., once the\r\n     property of Herbert, which I purchased at the late sale of\r\n     Mr. Gough's MSS., I obtained a volume full of extracts from\r\n     original letters between Baker and Ames; containing also the\r\n     _Will_ of the former, which is not inserted in Master's Life\r\n     of him, nor in the _Biographia Britannica_. The original\r\n     documents are in his Majesty's library, and were bought at\r\n     the sale of Mr. Tutet's books, A.D. 1786; no. 375. From\r\n     this will, as Herbert has copied it, the reader is presented\r\n     with the following strong proofs of the bibliomaniacal\r\n     \"ruling passion, strong in death,\" of our illustrious\r\n     antiquary. But let us not omit the manly tone of piety with\r\n     which this Will commences. \"In the name of God, Amen! I,\r\n     THOMAS BAKER, ejected Fellow of St. John's college,\r\n     Cambridge, do make my last will and testament, as follows:\r\n     First, I commend my soul into the hands of Almighty God (my\r\n     most gracious and good God), my faithful Creator and\r\n     merciful Redeemer, and, in all my dangers and difficulties,\r\n     a most constant protector. Blessed for ever be his holy\r\n     name.\" \"As to the temporal goods which it hath pleased the\r\n     same good God to bestow upon me (such as all men ought to be\r\n     content with) and are, I bless God, neither poverty nor\r\n     riches--I dispose of them in the following manner.\" Here\r\n     follow a few of his book bequests, which may be worth the\r\n     attention of those whose pursuits lead them to a particular\r\n     examination of these authors. \"Whereas I have made a deed of\r\n     gift or sale for one guinea, of 21 volumes in folio, of my\r\n     own hand-writing, to the Right Honourable EDWARD EARL OF\r\n     OXFORD, I confirm and ratify that gift by this my last will.\r\n     And I beg his lordship's acceptance of 'em, being sensible\r\n     that they are of little use or value, with two other volumes\r\n     in fol., markt Vol. 19, 20, since convey'd to him in like\r\n     manner. To my dear cosin, George Baker, of Crook, Esq., I\r\n     leave the _Life of Cardinal Wolsey_, noted with my own hand,\r\n     _Lord Clarendon's History_, with cuts and prints; and\r\n     _Winwood's Memorials_, in three volumes, fol., with a five\r\n     pound (Jacobus) piece of gold, only as a mark of respect and\r\n     affection, since he does not want it. To my worthy kinsman\r\n     and Friend Mr. George Smith, I leave _Godwin de Præsulibus\r\n     Angliæ_, and _Warræus de Præsulibus Hibernia_, both noted\r\n     with my own hand. To St. John's College Library I leave all\r\n     such books, printed or MSS., as I have and are wanting\r\n     there: excepting that I leave in trust to my worthy friend,\r\n     Dr. Middleton, for the University Library, _Archbishop\r\n     Wake's State of the Church_, noted and improved under his\r\n     own hand; _Bp. Burnet's History of the Reformation_, in\r\n     three volumes, noted in my hand; and _Bp. Kennett's Register\r\n     and Chronicle_ (for the memory of which three great\r\n     prelates, my honoured friends, I must always have due\r\n     regard). To these I add Mr. Ansty's, my worthy friend,\r\n     _History of the Garter_, in two vols., fol. _Wood's Athenæ\r\n     Oxon._; and _Maunsell's Catalogue_; both noted with my own\r\n     hand--and _Gunton's and Patrick's History of The Church of\r\n     Peterburgh_, noted (from Bishop Kennett) in my hand; with\r\n     fifteen volumes (more or less) in fol., all in my own hand;\r\n     and three volumes in 4to., part in my own hand.\" Let us\r\n     conclude in a yet more exalted strain of christian piety\r\n     than we began. \"Lastly, I constitute and appoint my dear\r\n     nephew, Richard Burton, Esq., my sole executor, to whom I\r\n     leave every thing undisposed of, which I hope will be enough\r\n     to reward his trouble. May God Almighty bless him, and give\r\n     him all the engaging qualities of his father, all the\r\n     vertues of his mother, and none of the sins or failings of\r\n     his uncle, which God knows are great and many:--and humbly,\r\n     O my God, I call for mercy! In testimony of this my will, I\r\n     have hereunto set my hand and seal, this 15th day of\r\n     October, 1739.\r\n\r\n     THO. BAKER.\r\n\r\n     And now, O my God, into thy hands I contentedly resign\r\n     myself: whether it be to life or death, thy will be done!\r\n     Long life I have not desired (and yet thou hast given it\r\n     me). Give me, if it be thy good pleasure, an easy and happy\r\n     death. Or if it shall please thee to visit me sorely, as my\r\n     sins have deserved, give me patience to bear thy correction,\r\n     and let me always say (even with my dying breath) Thy will\r\n     be done, Amen, Amen.\" Subjoined was this curious memorandum:\r\n     \"At the making of this will, I have, in the corner of my\r\n     outer study, next my chamber, 170 guineas; and on the other\r\n     side of the study towards the river, 100 guineas, more or\r\n     less, in several canvass bags, behind the shelves, being\r\n     more secret and hidden, to prevent purloyning. One or more\r\n     of the shelves markt G. among the latter is a five pound\r\n     (Jacobus) piece of gold.\"]\r\n\r\nLOREN. Never fear. He is an old acquaintance of mine; for, when\r\nresident at St. John's, Cambridge, I was frequently in the habit of\r\nconversing with his spirit in the library, and of getting curious\r\ninformation relating to choice and precious volumes, which had escaped\r\nthe sagacity of his predecessors, and of which I fear his successors\r\nhave not made the most proper use.\r\n\r\nPHIL. This is drawing too severe a conclusion. But Baker merits the\r\nthanks of a book-loving posterity.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. He is satisfied with this mention of his labours; for see, he\r\nretreats--and THEOBALD[374] and Tom Rawlinson rush forward to claim a\r\nmore marked attention: although I am not much disposed to draw a\r\nhighly finished picture of the editor of Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 374: Notwithstanding Pope has called THEOBALD by\r\n     an epithet which I have too much respect for the ears of my\r\n     readers to repeat, I do not scruple to rank the latter in\r\n     the list of bibliomaniacs. We have nothing here to do with\r\n     his edition of Shakspeare; which, by the bye, was no\r\n     despicable effort of editorial skill--as some of his notes,\r\n     yet preserved in the recent editions of our bard,\r\n     testify--but we may fairly allow Theobald to have been a\r\n     lover of Caxtonian lore, as his curious extract in _Mist's\r\n     Journal_, March 16, 1728, from our old printer's edition of\r\n     Virgil's Æneid, 1490, sufficiently testifies. While his\r\n     gothic library, composed in part of \"Caxton, Wynkyn, and De\r\n     Lyra,\" proves that he had something of the genuine blood of\r\n     bibliomaniacism running in his veins. See Mr. Bowles's\r\n     edition of _Pope's Works_, vol. v., 114, 257.]\r\n\r\nLIS. Is THOMAS RAWLINSON[375] so particularly deserving of\r\ncommendation, as a bibliomaniac?\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 375: Let us, first of all, hear Hearne discourse\r\n     rapturously of the bibliomaniacal reputation of T.\r\n     Rawlinson: \"In his fuit amicus noster nuperus THOMAS\r\n     RAWLINSONUS; cujus peritiam in supellectile libraria,\r\n     animique magnitudinem, nemo fere hominum eruditorum unquam\r\n     attigit, quod tamen vix agnoscet seculum ingratum. Quanquam\r\n     non desunt, qui putent, ipsius memoriæ statuam deberi, idque\r\n     etiam ad sumptus Bibliopolarum, quorum facultates mire\r\n     auxerat; quorum tamen aliqui (utcunque de illis optime\r\n     meritus fuisset) quum librorum Rawlinsoni auctio fieret, pro\r\n     virili (clandestinò tamen) laborabant, ut minus auspicatò\r\n     venderentur. Quod videntes probi aliquot, qui rem omuem\r\n     noverant, clamitabant, ô homines scelestos! hos jam oportet\r\n     in cruciatum hinc abripi! Quod hæc notem, non est cur vitio\r\n     vertas. Nam nil pol falsi dixi, mi lector. Quo tempore vixit\r\n     Rawlinsonus (et quidem perquam jucundum est commemorare),\r\n     magna et laudabilis erat æmulatio inter viros eruditos,\r\n     aliosque etiam, in libris perquirendis ac comparandis, imo\r\n     in fragmentis quoque. Adeo ut domicilia, ubi venales id\r\n     genus res pretiosæ prostabant, hominum coetu frequenti\r\n     semper complerentur, in magnum profecto commodum eorum, ad\r\n     quos libri aliæque res illæ pertinebant; quippe quod\r\n     emptores parvo ære nunquam, aut rarissime, compararent.\"\r\n     _Walter Hemingford, præfat._, p. CIV. In his preface to\r\n     _Alured de Beverly_, pp. v. vi., the copious stores of\r\n     Rawlinson's library, and the prompt kindness of the\r\n     possessor himself, are emphatically mentioned; while in the\r\n     preface to _Titi Livii Foro-Juliensis Vit. Henrici V._, p.\r\n     xi., we are told, of the former, that it was \"plurimis\r\n     libris rarissimis referta:\" and, in truth, such a\r\n     \"Bibliotheca refertissima\" was perhaps never before beheld.\r\n     Rawlinson was introduced into the Tatler, under the name TOM\r\n     FOLIO. His own house not being large enough, he hired\r\n     _London House_, in Aldersgate Street, for the reception of\r\n     his library; and there he used to regale himself with the\r\n     sight and the scent of innumerable black letter volumes,\r\n     arranged in \"sable garb,\" and stowed perhaps \"three deep,\"\r\n     from the bottom to the top of his house. He died in 1725;\r\n     and catalogues of his books for sale continued, for nine\r\n     succeeding years, to meet the public eye. The following is,\r\n     perhaps, as correct a list of these copious and\r\n     heterogeneously compiled catalogues, as can be presented to\r\n     the reader. I am indebted to the library of Mr. Heber for\r\n     such a curious bibliographical morçeau.

Does he imagine that the tomes in the Bodleian,\r\n     Vatican, and British Museum were, in each single collection,\r\n     more numerous than those in the _Aldersgate Street_\r\n     repository?--Or, at any rate, would not a view of this\r\n     Aldersgate Street collection give him the completest idea of\r\n     the _ne plus ultra_ of BOOK-PHRENSY in a private collector?\r\n     Rawlinson would have cut a very splendid figure, indeed,\r\n     with posterity, if some judicious catalogue-maker, the\r\n     Paterson of former times, had consolidated all these\r\n     straggling _Bibliothecal_ corps into one compact wedge-like\r\n     phalanx. Or, in other words, if one thick octavo volume,\r\n     containing a tolerably well classed arrangement of his\r\n     library, had descended to us--oh, then we should all have\r\n     been better able to appreciate the extraordinary treasures\r\n     of SUCH A COLLECTION! The genius of Pearson and Crofts would\r\n     have done homage to the towering spirit of Rawlinson.]\r\n\r\nLYSAND. If the most unabating activity and an insatiable appetite--if\r\nan eye, in regard to books, keen and sparkling as the ocean-bathed\r\nstar--if a purse, heavily laden and inexhaustible--if store-rooms\r\nrivalled only by the present warehouses of the East-India Company--if\r\na disposition to spread far and wide the influence of the BIBLIOMANIA,\r\nby issuing a _carte blanche_ for every desperately smitten antiquary\r\nto enter, and partake of the benefits of, his library--be criteria of\r\nBOOK-PHRENSY--why then the resemblance of this said Tom Rawlinson\r\nought to form a principal ornament in the capital of that gigantic\r\ncolumn, which sustains the temple of BOOK FAME! He was the _Tom Folio_\r\nof the Tatler, and may be called the _Leviathan_ of book-collectors\r\nduring nearly the first thirty years of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nLIS. I suppose, then, that Bagford, Murray, and Hearne, were not\r\nunknown to this towering bibliomaniac?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. On the contrary, I conclude, for certain, that, if they did\r\nnot drink wine, they constantly drank coffee, together: one of the\r\nhuge folio volumes of Bleau's Atlas serving them for a table.\r\n\r\nBut see yonder the rough rude features of HUMPHREY WANLEY[376] peering\r\nabove the crowd! All hail to thy honest physiognomy--for thou wert a\r\nrare _Book-wight_ in thy way! and as long as the fame of thy patron\r\nHarley shall live, so long, honest Humphrey, dost thou stand a sure\r\nchance of living \"for aye,\" in the memory of all worthy bibliomaniacs.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 376: Lysander is well warranted in borrowing the\r\n     pencil of Jan Steen, in the above bold and striking portrait\r\n     of WANLEY: who was, I believe, as honest a man, and as\r\n     learned a librarian, as ever sat down to morning chocolate\r\n     in velvet slippers. There is a portrait of him in oil in the\r\n     British Museum, and another similar one in the Bodleian\r\n     Library--from which latter it is evident, on the slightest\r\n     observation, that the inestimable, I ought to say immortal,\r\n     founder of the _Cow Pox system_ (my ever respected and\r\n     sincere friend, Dr. JENNER) had not then made known the\r\n     blessings resulting from the vaccine operation: for poor\r\n     Wanley's face is absolutely _peppered_ with _variolous_\r\n     indentations! Yet he seems to have been a hale and hearty\r\n     man, in spite of the merciless inroads made upon his visage;\r\n     for his cheeks are full, his hair is cropt and curly, and\r\n     his shoulders have a breadth which shew that the unrolling\r\n     of the HARLEIAN MSS. did not produce any enervating effluvia\r\n     or mismata [Transcriber's Note: miasmata]. Our poet, Gay, in\r\n     his epistle to Pope, _ep._ 18, thus hits off his\r\n     countenance:\r\n\r\n          O WANLEY, whence com'st thou with _shorten'd hair_,\r\n          And _visage_, from thy shelves, _with_ dust besprent?\r\n\r\n     But let us hear the testimony of a friend and fellow\r\n     bibliomaniac, called Thomas Hearne. The following desultory\r\n     information is translated from the preface to the _Annales\r\n     Prioratûs de Dunstable_--wherein, by the bye, there is a\r\n     good deal of pleasant information relating to Wanley. We are\r\n     here told that Wanley was \"born at Coventry; and, in his\r\n     younger days, employed his leisure hours in turning over\r\n     ancient MSS., and imitating the several hands in which they\r\n     were written. Lloyd, Bishop of Litchfield and Coventry, in\r\n     one of his episcopal visitations, was the first who noticed\r\n     and patronized him. He demanded that Wanley should be\r\n     brought to him; he examined him \"suis ipsius, non alterius,\r\n     oculis;\" and ascertained whether what so many respectable\r\n     people had said of his talents was true or false--'A few\r\n     words with you, young man,' said the Bishop. Wanley\r\n     approached with timidity--'What are your pursuits, and where\r\n     are the ancient MSS. which you have in your possession?'\r\n     Wanley answered readily; exhibited his MSS., and entered\r\n     into a minute discussion respecting the ancient method of\r\n     painting.\" Hearne then expatiates feelingly upon the\r\n     excessive care and attention which Wanley devoted to ancient\r\n     MSS.; how many pieces of vellum he unrolled; and how,\r\n     sometimes, in the midst of very urgent business, he would\r\n     lose no opportunity of cultivating what was useful and\r\n     agreeable in his particular pursuit. His hobby horse seems\r\n     to have been the discovery of the ancient method of\r\n     colouring or painting--yet towards BRITISH HISTORY and\r\n     ANTIQUITIES he constantly cast a fond and faithful eye. How\r\n     admirably well-calculated he was for filling the situation\r\n     of librarian to Lord Oxford is abundantly evinced by his\r\n     catalogue of the Harleian MSS.; vide p. 89, ante. Of his\r\n     attachment to the Bibliomania there are innumerable proofs.\r\n     Take this, _inter alia_; \"I spoke to Mr. Wanley, who is not\r\n     unmindful of his promise, but says he will not trouble you\r\n     with a letter, till he has something better to present you,\r\n     which he doubts not he shall have this winter _among Mr.\r\n     Harley's MSS._ Mr. Wanley has the greatest collection of\r\n     _English Bibles, Psalters, &c._, that ever any one man had.\r\n     They cost him above 50_l._, and he has been above twenty\r\n     years in collecting them. He would part with them, I\r\n     believe, but I know not at what price.\" _Masters's Life of\r\n     Baker_, p. 27. Consult also the preface to the _Catalogue of\r\n     the Harleian MSS._, 1808, 3 vols., folio, p. 6.]\r\n\r\nA softer noise succeeds; and the group becomes calm and attentive, as\r\nif some grand personage were advancing. See, 'tis HARLEY, EARL OF\r\nOXFORD![377]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 377: There was an amusing little volume, printed\r\n     in 1782, 8vo., concerning the library of the late King of\r\n     France; and an equally interesting one might have been\r\n     composed concerning the HARLEIAN COLLECTION--but who can now\r\n     undertake the task?--who concentrate all the rivulets which\r\n     have run from this splendid reservoir into other similar\r\n     pieces of water? The undertaking is impracticable. We have\r\n     nothing, therefore, I fear, left us but to sit down and\r\n     weep; to hang our harps upon the neighbouring willows, and\r\n     to think upon the Book \"SION,\" with desponding sensations\r\n     that its foundations have been broken up, and its wealth\r\n     dissipated. But let us adopt a less flowery style of\r\n     communication. Before HARLEY was created a peer, his library\r\n     was fixed at Wimple, in Cambridgeshire, the usual place of\r\n     his residence; \"whence he frequently visited his friends at\r\n     Cambridge, and in particular Mr. BAKER, for whom he always\r\n     testified the highest regard. This nobleman's attachment to\r\n     literature, the indefatigable pains he took, and the large\r\n     sums he expended in making the above collection, are too\r\n     well known to stand in need of any further notice.\"\r\n     _Masters's life of Baker_, p. 107. The eulogies of Maittaire\r\n     and Hearne confirm every thing here advanced by Masters; and\r\n     the testimony of Pope himself, that Harley \"left behind him\r\n     one of the finest libraries in Europe,\" warrants us, if\r\n     other testimonies were not even yet daily before our eyes,\r\n     to draw the same conclusion. In a periodical publication\r\n     entitled _The Director_, to which I contributed all the\r\n     intelligence under the article \"BIBLIOGRAPHIANA,\" there\r\n     appeared the following copious, and, it is presumed, not\r\n     uninteresting, details respecting the Earl of Oxford, and\r\n     his Library. After the sale of Mr. Bridges's books, no event\r\n     occurred in the bibliographical world, worthy of notice,\r\n     till the sale of the famous _Harleian Library_, or the books\r\n     once in the possession of the celebrated HARLEY, EARL OF\r\n     OXFORD. This nobleman was not less distinguished in the\r\n     political than in the literary world; and \"was a remarkable\r\n     instance of the fickleness of popular opinion, and the\r\n     danger of being removed from the lower to the upper house of\r\n     parliament.\" (Noble's _Continuation of Granger_, vol. ii.,\r\n     23.) He was born in the year 1661, was summoned to the house\r\n     of Lords by the titles of Earl of Oxford and Mortimer, in\r\n     1711; declared minister and lord high treasurer in the same\r\n     year; resigned, and was impeached, in the year 1715;\r\n     acquitted, without being brought to a trial, in 1717; and\r\n     died at his house in Albemarle Street, in 1724. A character\r\n     so well known in the annals of this country needs no\r\n     particular illustration in the present place. The _Harleian\r\n     Collection of MSS._ was purchased by government for\r\n     10,000_l._, and is now deposited in the British Museum (vide\r\n     p. 89, ante). The _Books_ were disposed of to THOMAS\r\n     OSBORNE, of Gray's Inn, bookseller;--to the irreparable\r\n     loss, and, I had almost said, the indelible disgrace, of the\r\n     country. It is, indeed, for ever to be lamented that a\r\n     collection so extensive, so various, so magnificent, and\r\n     intrinsically valuable, should have become the property of\r\n     one who necessarily, from his situation in life, became a\r\n     purchaser, only that he might be a vender, of the volumes.\r\n     Osborne gave 13,000_l._ for the collection; a sum which must\r\n     excite the astonishment of the present age, when it is\r\n     informed that Lord Oxford gave 18,000_l._ for the _Binding_\r\n     only, of the least part of them. (From Oldys's _interleaved\r\n     Langbaine_. See Brydges's _Cens. Literar._, vol. i., p.\r\n     438.) In the year 1743-4 appeared an account of this\r\n     collection, under the following title, _Catalogus\r\n     Bibliothecæ Harleianæ, &c._, in four volumes (the 5th not\r\n     properly appertaining to it). Dr. Johnson was employed by\r\n     Osborne to write the preface, which, says Boswell, \"he has\r\n     done with an ability that cannot fail to impress all his\r\n     readers with admiration of his philological attainments.\"\r\n     _Life of Johnson_, vol. i., 81, edit. 4to. In my humble\r\n     apprehension, the preface is unworthy of the doctor: it\r\n     contains a few general philological reflections, expressed\r\n     in a style sufficiently stately, but is divested of\r\n     bibliographical anecdote and interesting intelligence. The\r\n     first two volumes are written in Latin by Johnson; the third\r\n     and fourth volumes, which are a repetition of the two\r\n     former, are composed in English by Oldys: and,\r\n     notwithstanding its defects, it is the best catalogue of a\r\n     large library of which we can boast. It should be in every\r\n     good collection. To the volumes was prefixed the following\r\n     advertisement: \"As the curiosity of spectators, before the\r\n     sale, may produce disorder in the disposition of the books,\r\n     it is necessary to advertise the public that there will be\r\n     no admission into the library before the day of sale, which\r\n     will be on Tuesday, the 14th of February, 1744.\" It seems\r\n     that Osborne had charged the sum of 5_s._ to each of his\r\n     first two volumes, which was represented by the booksellers\r\n     \"as an avaricious innovation;\" and, in a paper published in\r\n     \"_The Champion_,\" they, or their mercenaries, reasoned so\r\n     justly as to allege that \"if Osborne could afford a very\r\n     large price for the library, he might therefore afford to\r\n     _give away_ the catalogue.\" _Preface to_ vol. iii., p. 1. To\r\n     this charge Osborne answered that his catalogue was drawn up\r\n     with great pains, and at a heavy expense; but, to obviate\r\n     all objections, \"those,\" says he, \"who have paid five\r\n     shillings a volume shall be allowed, at any time within\r\n     three months after the day of sale, either to return them in\r\n     exchange for books, or to send them back, and receive their\r\n     money.\" This, it must be confessed, was sufficiently\r\n     liberal. Osborne was also accused of _rating his books at\r\n     too high a price_: to this the following was his reply, or\r\n     rather Dr. Johnson's; for the style of the Doctor is\r\n     sufficiently manifest: \"If, therefore, I have set a high\r\n     value upon books--if I have vainly imagined literature to be\r\n     more fashionable than it really is, or idly hoped to revive\r\n     a taste well nigh extinguished, I know not why I should be\r\n     persecuted with clamour and invective, since I shall only\r\n     suffer by my mistake, and be obliged to keep those books\r\n     which I was in hopes of selling.\"--_Preface to the 3d\r\n     volume._ The fact is that Osborne's charges were extremely\r\n     moderate; and the sale of the books was so very slow that\r\n     Johnson assured Boswell \"there was not much gained by the\r\n     bargain.\" Whoever inspects Osborne's catalogue of 1748 (four\r\n     years after the Harleian sale), will find in it many of the\r\n     most valuable of Lord Oxford's books; and, among them, a\r\n     copy of the Aldine Plato of 1513, _struck off upon vellum_,\r\n     marked at 21_l._ only: for this identical copy Lord Oxford\r\n     gave 100 guineas, as Dr. Mead informed Dr. Askew; from the\r\n     latter of whose collections it was purchased by Dr. Hunter,\r\n     and is now in the Hunter Museum. There will also be found,\r\n     in Osborne's catalogues of 1748 and 1753, some of the\r\n     scarcest books in English Literature, marked at 2, or 3, or\r\n     4_s._, for which three times the number of _pounds_ is now\r\n     given.\r\n\r\n     ANALYSIS OF THE HARLEIAN LIBRARY.\r\n\r\n     I shall take the liberty of making an arrangement of the\r\n     books different from that which appears in the Harleian\r\n     catalogue; but shall scrupulously adhere to the number of\r\n     departments therein specified. And first of those in\r\n\r\n     1. _Divinity._\r\n\r\n     In the _Greek_, _Latin_, _French_, and _Italian_ languages,\r\n     there were about 2000 theological volumes. Among these, the\r\n     most rare and curious were Bamler's bible of 1466,\r\n     beautifully illuminated, in 2 volumes: Schæffer's bible of\r\n     1472. The famous Zurich bible of 1543, \"all of which, except\r\n     a small part done by Theodoras Bibliander, was translated\r\n     from the Hebrew by a Jew, who styled himself Leo Judæ, or\r\n     the Lion of Judah. The Greek books were translated by Petrus\r\n     Cholinus. The New Testament is Erasmus's.\" The Scrutinium\r\n     Scripturarum of Rabbi Samuel, Mant., 1475; a book which is\r\n     said \"to have been concealed by the Jews nearly 200 years:\r\n     the author of it is supposed to have lived at a period not\r\n     much later than the destruction of Jerusalem.\" The Islandic\r\n     bible of 1664, \"not to be met with, without the utmost\r\n     difficulty, and therefore a real curiosity.\" The works of\r\n     Hemmerlin, Basil: 1497; \"the author was ranked in the first\r\n     class of those whose works were condemned by the church of\r\n     Rome.\" The Mozarabic Missal printed at Toledo, in 1500--of\r\n     which some account is given at p. 161, ante. The collection\r\n     of _English_ books in Divinity could not have amounted to\r\n     less than 2500 volumes. Among the rarest of these, printed\r\n     in the fifteenth century, was \"The Festyvall, begynning at\r\n     the fyrst Sonday of Advent, in worship of God and all his\r\n     Sayntes,\" &c., printed at Paris, in 1495. There was ten\r\n     books printed by Caxton, and some exceedingly curious ones\r\n     by Wynkyn de Worde and Pynson.\r\n\r\n     2. _History and Antiquities._\r\n\r\n     There appear to have been, on the whole, nearly 4000 volumes\r\n     in this department: of which, some of those relating to\r\n     Great Britain were inestimable, from the quantity of MS.\r\n     notes by Sir William Dugdale, Archbishop Parker, Thomas\r\n     Rawlinson, Thomas Baker, &c. The preceding number includes\r\n     600 relating to the history and antiquities of Italy; 500 to\r\n     those of France. (This part of the catalogue deserves\r\n     particular attention, as it contains a larger collection of\r\n     pieces relating to the history of France than was, perhaps,\r\n     ever exposed to sale in this nation; here being not only the\r\n     ancient chronicles and general histories, but the memoirs of\r\n     particular men, and the genealogies of most of the families\r\n     illustrious for their antiquity. See _Bibl. Harl._, vol.\r\n     iii., p. 159.) 150 to those of Spain; and about 250 relating\r\n     to Germany and the United Provinces.\r\n\r\n     3. _Books of Prints, Sculpture, and Drawings._\r\n\r\n     In this department, rich beyond description, there could not\r\n     have been fewer than 20,000 articles, on the smallest\r\n     computation: of which nearly 2000 were original drawings by\r\n     the great Italian and Flemish masters. The works of CALLOT\r\n     were preserved in 4 large volumes, containing not fewer than\r\n     _nine hundred and twelve prints_. \"All choice impressions,\r\n     and making the completest set of his works that are to be\r\n     seen.\" See _Bibl. Harl._, vol. iii., no. 562, \"HOLLAR'S\r\n     works, consisting of all his pieces, and bound in 12 folio\r\n     volumes, in morocco. One of the completest and best sets in\r\n     the world, both as to the number and goodness of the\r\n     impressions.\" Vid. _ibid._, no. 468. It is now in the\r\n     library of the Duke of Rutland. \"One hundred and\r\n     thirty-three heads of illustrious men and women, after\r\n     VANDYKE. This set of Vandyke's heads may be said to be the\r\n     best and completest that is to be met with any where: there\r\n     being the 12 heads which he etched himself, as likewise 79\r\n     worked off by Martin Vanden Enden: and what adds still to\r\n     the value of them is that the greater part were collected by\r\n     the celebrated Marriette at Paris, his name being signed on\r\n     the back, as warranting them good proofs.\" Tne\r\n     [Transcriber's Note: The] engravings from RAPHAEL'S\r\n     paintings, upwards of 200 in number, and by the best foreign\r\n     masters, were contained in 4 splendid morocco volumes. The\r\n     works of the SADELERS, containing upwards of 959 prints, in\r\n     8 large folio volumes, were also in this magnificent\r\n     collection: and the Albert Durers, Goltziuses, Rembrandts,\r\n     &c., innumerable!\r\n\r\n     4. _Collection of Portraits._\r\n\r\n     This magnificent collection, uniformly bound in 102 large\r\n     folio volumes, contained a series of heads of illustrious\r\n     and remarkable characters, to the amount of nearly 10,000 in\r\n     number. It is said, in the catalogue, to be \"perhaps the\r\n     largest collection of heads ever exposed to sale.\" We are\r\n     also informed that it \"was thought proper, for the\r\n     accommodation of the curious, to separate the volumes.\"\r\n     Eheu! Eheu!\r\n\r\n     5. _Philosophy, Chemistry, Medicine, &c._\r\n\r\n     Under this head, comprehending anatomy, astronomy,\r\n     mathematics, and alchemy, there appear to have been not\r\n     fewer than 2500 volumes in the foreign languages, and about\r\n     600 in the English: some of them of the most curious kind,\r\n     and of the rarest occurrence.\r\n\r\n     6. _Geography, Chronology, and General History._\r\n\r\n     There were about 290 volumes on these subjects, written in\r\n     the Latin, French, Italian, and Spanish languages: and about\r\n     300 volumes in our own language. Some of the scarcest books\r\n     printed by Caxton were among the latter.\r\n\r\n     7. _Voyages and Histories relating to the East and West\r\n     Indies._\r\n\r\n     About 800 volumes:--nearly equally divided into the English\r\n     and foreign languages. Among the English, were Caxton's\r\n     \"Recuyell of the historys of Troye,\" 1471 (supposed to be\r\n     the first book printed in this country;) and his \"Siege and\r\n     conquest of Jherusalem,\" 1481.\r\n\r\n     8. _Civil, Canon, and Statute Law._\r\n\r\n     At least 800 volumes: 300 in the foreign languages, and the\r\n     remaining in English.\r\n\r\n     9. _Books of Sculpture, Architecture, &c._\r\n\r\n     Not fewer than 900 volumes, comprehending every thing\r\n     published up to that period which was valuable or rare. Of\r\n     these, more than 700 were written in Latin, Italian, French,\r\n     or Spanish--and embellished with every beauty of graphic\r\n     illustration.\r\n\r\n     10. _Greek and Latin Classics; Grammars and Lexicons._\r\n\r\n     This very valuable body of Grecian and Roman literature\r\n     could not have included fewer than 2400 volumes--and, among\r\n     these, almost every work of rarity and excellence. In the\r\n     article of \"Cicero\" alone, there were 115 volumes printed in\r\n     the _fifteenth century_; every subsequent edition of that\r\n     and other authors, then distinguished for its accuracy or\r\n     erudition, may also, I believe, be discovered in the\r\n     catalogue. Most book-collectors know the sumptuous manner in\r\n     which the Harleian copies are bound.\r\n\r\n     11. _Books printed upon Vellum._\r\n\r\n     In this interesting department of typography, there were\r\n     about 220 volumes--upwards of 70 in folio, 40 in quarto, and\r\n     100 in octavo. Of the former, the most curious and rare\r\n     articles were the Mentz bible of 1462, 2 vols., and the\r\n     travels of Breydenbachus, printed at Mentz in 1486. \"This\r\n     book is an uncommon object of curiosity, as it is, perhaps,\r\n     the first book of travels that was ever printed, and is\r\n     adorned with maps and pictures very remarkable. The view of\r\n     _Venice_ is more than five feet long, and the map of the\r\n     _Holy Land_ more than three; there are views of many other\r\n     cities. It is printed in the Gothic character.\" See _Bibl.\r\n     Harl._, vol. iii., no. 3213. The octavos were chiefly\r\n     \"Heures à l'usage,\" so common at the beginning of the 16th\r\n     century: but, if the catalogue be correctly published, there\r\n     appears to have been one of these books printed at Paris, as\r\n     early as the year 1466, \"extremely beautiful cuts.\" See the\r\n     _Bibl. Harl._, vol. iv., no. 18406. Now, if this were\r\n     true, it would make known a curious fact in Parisian\r\n     typography--for the usually received opinion among\r\n     bibliographers is that no printed book appeared in France\r\n     before the year 1467, when the art was first introduced at\r\n     _Tours_; and none at _Paris_ before the year 1469-70--when\r\n     Crantz and Friburger were engaged to print there.\r\n\r\n     12. _English Poetry, Romances, and Novels._\r\n\r\n     There could not have been fewer than 900 volumes in this\r\n     amusing department; and among them some editions of the\r\n     rarest occurrence. Every thing printed by Caxton on these\r\n     subjects, including a complete and magnificent copy of\r\n     _Morte d'Arthur_, was in the collection--and, in respect to\r\n     other curious works, it will be sufficient to mention only\r\n     the following, as a specimen. \"Kynge-Richarde Cuer du Lyon,\r\n     W. de Worde, 1528: Gascoigne's Poesies, 1575--Spenser's\r\n     Shepheardes Calenders, 1586: Webbe's Discourse of English\r\n     Poetrie, 1586: Nash's Art of English Poesie, 1589.\" Some of\r\n     these volumes were afterwards marked by Osborne, in his\r\n     catalogues, at 3 or 4 shillings!\r\n\r\n     13. _Livres François, Ital., et Hispan._\r\n\r\n     There might have been 700 volumes in these foreign\r\n     languages, of which nearly 500 related to _poetry_\r\n     (exclusively of others in the foregoing and following\r\n     departments).\r\n\r\n     14. _Parliamentary Affairs and Trials._\r\n\r\n     Upwards of 400 volumes.\r\n\r\n     15. _Trade and Commerce._\r\n\r\n     About 300 volumes.\r\n\r\n     It will be seen from the preceding divisions, and from the\r\n     gradual diminution of the number of volumes in each, that I\r\n     have gone through the principal departments of the Harleian\r\n     collection of books: and yet there remain _fifty\r\n     departments_ to be enumerated! These are the following: 16.\r\n     _Critici et Opera collecta._ 17. _Vultus et Imagines Illust.\r\n     Virorum._ 18. _Pompæ, Ceremoniæ, et Exequiæ._ 19. _De re\r\n     Militari, de Arte Equestri, et de re Navali._ 20.\r\n     _Heraldica._ 21. _Epistolæ, Panegyrici, et Orationes._ 22.\r\n     _Bibliothecarii et Miscellanei._ 23. _Tractatus Pacis et\r\n     Politici._ 24. _Traductions des Auteurs Gr. et Latin._ 25.\r\n     _Translations from Greek and Latin Authors._ 26. _Laws,\r\n     Customs, &c., of the City of London._ 27. _Military, Naval\r\n     affairs, and Horsemanship._ 28. _Heraldry._ 9.\r\n     [Transcriber's Note: 29.] _Husbandry, Gardening,\r\n     Agriculture._ 30. _Magic, Sorcery, Witchcraft._ 31.\r\n     _Miraculous, Monstrous, and Supernatural._ 32. _Lives of\r\n     Eminent Persons._ 33. _Laws and Customs of divers Places._\r\n     34. _Tythes, Sacrilege, and Non-residence, &c._ 35. _Cases\r\n     of divers Persons._ 36. _Prisons and Prisoners._ 37. _Lives\r\n     of Murderers, Highwaymen, Pirates, &c._ 38. _Speeches of\r\n     Persons executed for divers Offences._ 39. _Justices,\r\n     Juries, and Charges._ 40. _Poor, and Charitable Uses._ 41.\r\n     _Matrimony, Divorce, &c._ 42. _Universities._ 43.\r\n     _Allegiance, Supremacy, Non Resistance, &c._ 44. _Bank and\r\n     Bankers._ 45. _Funds, Taxes, Public Credit, Money, Coin,\r\n     &c._ 46. _War and Standing Armies._ 47. _Admiralty and\r\n     Navy._ 48. _Letters on various Subjects._ 49. _Treatises of\r\n     Peace, Royal Prerogative, &c._ 50. _Navigation._ 51.\r\n     _Education, Grammar and Schools._ 52. _Ludicrous,\r\n     Entertaining, Satirical, and Witty._ 53. _English\r\n     Miscellanies._ 54. _Ecclesiastical and Civil History of\r\n     Scotland._ 55. _Do. of Ireland._ 56. _Grammars and\r\n     Dictionnaries._ 57. _Plays, and relating to the Theatre._\r\n     58. _Mathematics._ 59. _Astrology, Astronomy, and\r\n     Chymistry._ 60. _Horsemanship._ 61. _Cookery._ 62.\r\n     _Convocation._ 63. _Sieges, Battles, War, &c._ 64. _Pomp and\r\n     Ceremony._ 65. _Books relating to Writing and Printing._ 66.\r\n     _Essays on various Subjects._ It will probably be no very\r\n     unreasonable computation to allow to each of these remaining\r\n     divisions 80 volumes: so that multiplying the whole 50\r\n     divisions by 80 there will be the additional number of 4000\r\n     volumes to make the library complete. I ought to mention\r\n     that, in my account of this extensive library, I have not\r\n     included the _Pamphlets_. Of these alone, according to Mr.\r\n     Gough (_Brit. Topog._ v., i., 669), there were computed to\r\n     be 400,000! We will now say a few words about the private\r\n     character of Lord Oxford, and conclude with a brief account\r\n     of Osborne. Every body has heard of the intimacy which\r\n     subsisted between POPE and the Earl of Oxford. In the year\r\n     1721, when the latter was at his country seat, Pope sent him\r\n     a copy of Parnell's poems (of which he had undertaken the\r\n     publication on the decease of Parnell), with a letter in\r\n     poetry and prose. It seems that Pope wished to prefix his\r\n     own verses to the collection; and thus alludes to them, in\r\n     his letter to Lord Harley of the date of 1721: \"Poor\r\n     Parnell, before he died, left me the charge of publishing\r\n     those few remains of his: I have a strong desire to make\r\n     them, their author, and their publisher, more considerable,\r\n     by addressing and dedicating them all to you, &c. All I\r\n     shall say for it is that 'tis the only dedication I ever\r\n     writ, and shall be the only one, whether you accept it or\r\n     not: for I will not bow the knee to a less man than my Lord\r\n     Oxford, and I expect to see no greater in my time.\"\r\n\r\n     The following is the latter part of the _Poetical Epistle_\r\n     here alluded to:\r\n\r\n          And sure, if aught below the seats divine\r\n          Can touch immortals, 'tis a soul like thine:\r\n          A soul supreme, in each hard instance tried,\r\n          Above all pain, all passion, and all pride;\r\n          The rage of power, the blast of public breath,\r\n          The lust of lucre, and the dread of death.\r\n\r\n            In vain to deserts thy retreat is made;\r\n          The muse attends thee to thy silent shade:\r\n          'Tis her's the brave man's latest steps to trace,\r\n          Rejudge his acts, and dignify disgrace.\r\n          When int'rest calls off all her sneaking train,\r\n          And all th' obliged desert, and all the vain;\r\n          She waits, or to the scaffold, or the cell,\r\n          When the last lingering friend has bid farewell.\r\n          Ev'n now, she shades thy evening walk with bays,\r\n          (No hireling she, no prostitute of praise)\r\n          Ev'n now, observant of the parting ray,\r\n          Eyes the calm sun-set of thy various day;\r\n          Thro' fortune's cloud ONE truly great can see,\r\n          Nor fears to tell that MORTIMER is he!\r\n\r\n          _Pope's Works_, vol. ii., p. 320-3. Bowles's edit.\r\n\r\n     The following was the reply of the Earl of Oxford to Mr.\r\n     Pope.\r\n\r\n     SIR,\r\n\r\n     I received your packet, which could not but give me great\r\n     pleasure to see you preserve an old friend in your memory;\r\n     for it must needs be very agreeable to be remembered by\r\n     those we highly value. But then, how much shame did it cause\r\n     me when I read your very fine verses inclosed! My mind\r\n     reproached me how far short I came of what your great\r\n     friendship and delicate pen would partially describe me. You\r\n     ask my consent to publish it: to what straits doth this\r\n     reduce me! I look back, indeed, to those evenings I have\r\n     usefully and pleasantly spent with Mr. Pope, Mr. Parnell,\r\n     Dean Swift, the Doctor (Arbuthnot), &c. I should be glad the\r\n     world knew you admitted me to your friendship; and since\r\n     your affection is too hard for your judgment, I am contented\r\n     to let the world know how well Mr. Pope can write upon a\r\n     barren subject. I return you an exact copy of the verses,\r\n     that I may keep the original, as a testimony of the only\r\n     error you have been guilty of. I hope, very speedily, to\r\n     embrace you in London, and to assure you of the particular\r\n     esteem and friendship wherewith I am your, &c.,\r\n\r\n     OXFORD.\r\n\r\n     Of TOM OSBORNE I have in vain endeavoured to collect some\r\n     interesting biographical details. What I know of him shall\r\n     be briefly stated. He was the most celebrated bookseller of\r\n     his day; and appears, from a series of his catalogues in my\r\n     possession, to have carried on a successful trade from the\r\n     year 1738 to 1768. What fortune he amassed, is not, I\r\n     believe, very well known: his collections were truly\r\n     valuable, for they consisted of the purchased libraries of\r\n     the most eminent men of those times. In his stature he was\r\n     short and thick; and, to his inferiors, generally spoke in\r\n     an authoritative and insolent manner. \"It has been\r\n     confidently related,\" says Boswell, \"that Johnson, one day,\r\n     knocked Osborne down in his shop with a folio, and put his\r\n     foot upon his neck. The simple truth I had from Johnson\r\n     himself. 'Sir, he was impertinent to me, and I beat him. But\r\n     it was not in his shop: it was in my own chamber.'\" 4to.\r\n     edit., i., 81. Of Osborne's philological attainments, the\r\n     meanest opinion must be formed, if we judge from his\r\n     advertisements, which were sometimes inserted in the London\r\n     Gazette, and drawn up in the most ridiculously vain and\r\n     ostentatious style. He used to tell the public that he\r\n     possessed \"all the pompous editions of Classicks and\r\n     Lexicons.\" I insert the two following advertisements,\r\n     prefixed, the one to his catalogue of 1748, the other to\r\n     that of 1753, for the amusement of my bibliographical\r\n     readers, and as a model for Messrs. Payne, White, Miller,\r\n     Evans, Priestley, and Cuthell. \"This catalogue being very\r\n     large, and of consequence very expensive to the proprietor,\r\n     he humbly requests that, if it falls into the hands of any\r\n     gentleman _gratis_, who chooses not himself to be a\r\n     purchaser of any of the books contained in it, that such\r\n     gentleman will be pleased to recommend it to any other whom\r\n     he thinks may be so, or to return it.\" To his catalogue of\r\n     1753 was the following: \"To the Nobility and Gentry who\r\n     please to favour me with their commands. It is hoped, as I\r\n     intend to give no offence to any nobleman or gentleman, that\r\n     do me the honour of being my customer, by putting a price on\r\n     my catalogue, by which means they may not receive it as\r\n     usual--it is desired that such nobleman or gentleman as have\r\n     not received it, would be pleased to send for it; and it's\r\n     likewise requested of such gentleman who do receive it,\r\n     that, if they chuse not to purchase any of the books\r\n     themselves, _they would recommend it to any bookish\r\n     gentleman of their acquaintance, or to return it_, and the\r\n     favour shall be acknowledged by, their most obedient and\r\n     obliged,\r\n\r\n     T. OSBORNE.\"\r\n\r\n     I shall conclude with the following curious story told of\r\n     him, in Mr. Nichols's _Anecdotes of Bowyer_ the Printer.\r\n     \"Mr. David Papillon, a gentleman of fortune and literary\r\n     taste, as well as a good antiquary (who died in 1762)\r\n     contracted with Osborne to furnish him with an 100_l._ worth\r\n     of books, at _threepence a piece_. The only conditions were,\r\n     that they should be perfect, and that there should be no\r\n     duplicate. Osborne was highly pleased with his bargain, and\r\n     the first great purchase he made, he sent Mr. P. a large\r\n     quantity; but in the next purchase, he found he could send\r\n     but few, and the next, still fewer. Not willing, however, to\r\n     give up, he sent books worth _five shillings_ a piece; and,\r\n     at last, was forced to go and beg to be let off the\r\n     contract. Eight thousand books would have been wanted!\"--See\r\n     p. 101-2, note [symbol: double dagger].]\r\n\r\nLIS. Let us rise to pay him homage!\r\n\r\nPHIL. Lisardo is now fairly bewitched. He believes in the existence\r\nof the group!--Help, ho! Fetters and warder for--\r\n\r\nLOREN. Philemon loves to indulge his wit at his friend's expense. Is't\r\nnot so, Lisardo?\r\n\r\nLIS. I forgive him. 'Twas a \"glorious fault.\" But, indeed, I would\r\nstrip to the skin, if this said nobleman longed for my coat,\r\nwaistcoat, small clothes, and shirt, to form him a cushion to sit\r\nupon! I have heard such wonderful things said of his library!--\r\n\r\nLYSAND. And not more wonderful than its reputation justifies. Well\r\nmight Pope be enamoured of such a noble friend--and well might even\r\nDr. Mead bow to the superior splendour of such a book-competitor!\r\nWhile the higher order of bibliomaniacs, reposing upon satin sofas,\r\nwere quaffing burgundy out of Harley's curiously cut goblets, and\r\nlistening to the captivating tale of Mead or Folkes, respecting a\r\nVELLUM _Editio Princeps_--the lower order, with Bagford at their head,\r\nwere boisterously regaling themselves below, drinking ale round an\r\noaken table, and toasting their patron, till the eye could no longer\r\ndiscover the glass, nor the tongue utter his name. Aloft, in mid air,\r\nsat the soothed spirits of Smith and North; pointing, with their thin,\r\ntransparent fingers, to the apotheosis of CAXTON and ALDUS! Suddenly,\r\na crowd of pipy fragrance involves the room: these ærial forms cease\r\nto be visible; and broken sounds, like the retiring tide beneath Dover\r\ncliff, die away into utter silence. Sleep succeeds: but short is the\r\nslumber of enthusiastic bibliomaniacs! The watchman rouses them from\r\nrepose: and the annunciation of the hour of \"two o'clock, and a\r\nmoonlight morning,\" reminds them of their cotton night-caps and flock\r\nmattrasses. They start up, and sally forwards; chaunting, midst the\r\ndeserted streets, and with eyes turned sapiently towards the moon,\r\n\"Long life to the King of Book-Collectors, HARLEY, EARL OF OXFORD!\"\r\n\r\nLOREN. A truce, Lysander! I entreat a truce!\r\n\r\nLYSAND. To what?\r\n\r\nLOREN. To this discourse. You must be exhausted.\r\n\r\nPHIL. Indeed I agree with Lorenzo: for Lysander has surpassed, in\r\nprolixity, the reputation of any orator within St. Stephen's chapel.\r\nIt only remains to eclipse, in a similar manner, the speeches which\r\nwere delivered at Hardy's trial--and then he may be called the\r\n_Nonpareil_ of orators!\r\n\r\nLYSAND. If you banter me, I am dumb. Nor did I know that there was any\r\nthing of eloquence in my chit-chat. If Lisardo had had my experience,\r\nwe might _then_ have witnessed some glittering exhibitions of\r\nimagination in the book-way!\r\n\r\nLIS. My most excellent friend, I will strive to obtain this\r\nexperience, since you are pleased to compliment me upon what I was not\r\nconscious of possessing--But, in truth, Lysander, our obligations to\r\nyou are infinite.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. No more; unless you are weary of this discourse--\r\n\r\nPHIL. LIS. Weary!?\r\n\r\nLOREN. Let me here exercise my undeniable authority. A _sandwich_,\r\nlike the evening rain after a parching day, will recruit Lysander's\r\nexhausted strength. What say you?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. \"I shall in all things obey your high command.\" But hark--I\r\nhear the outer gate bell ring! The ladies are arrived: and you know my\r\nbashfulness in female society. Adieu, BIBLIOMANIA! 'till the morrow.\r\n\r\nLOREN. Nay, you are drawing too dismal conclusions. My sisters are not\r\nsworn enemies to this kind of discourse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe arrival of ALMANSA and BELINDA, the sisters of Lorenzo put a stop\r\nto the conversation. So abrupt a silence disconcerted the ladies; who,\r\nin a sudden, but, it must be confessed, rather taunting, strain--asked\r\nwhether they should order their bed-chamber candlesticks, and retire\r\nto rest?\r\n\r\nLIS. Not if you are disposed to listen to the most engaging\r\nbook-anecdote orator in his majesty's united realms!\r\n\r\nALMAN. Well, this may be a sufficient inducement for us to remain. But\r\nwhy so suddenly silent, gentlemen?\r\n\r\nLOREN. The conversation had ceased before you arrived. We were\r\nthinking of a _hung-beef sandwich_ and a glass of madeira to recruit\r\nLysander's exhausted powers. He has been discoursing ever since\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nBELIND. I will be his attendant and cup-bearer too, if he promises to\r\nresume his discourse. But you have probably dispatched the most\r\ninteresting part.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Not exactly so, I would hope, fair Lady! Your brother's\r\nhospitality will add fresh energy to my spirit; and, like the renewed\r\noil in an exhausted lamp, will cause the flame to break forth with\r\nfresh splendour.\r\n\r\nBELIND. Sir, I perceive your ingenuity, at least, has not forsaken\r\nyou--in whatever state your memory may be!--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere the _sandwiches_ made their appearance: and Lorenzo seated his\r\nguests, with his sisters, near him, round a small circular table. The\r\nrepast was quickly over: and Philemon, stirring the sugar within a\r\ngoblet of hot madeira wine and water, promised them all a romantic\r\nbook-story, if the ladies would only lend a gracious ear. Such a\r\nrequest was, of course, immediately complied with.\r\n\r\nPHIL. The story is short--\r\n\r\nLIS. And sweet, I ween.\r\n\r\nPHIL. That remains to be proved. But listen.\r\n\r\nYou all know my worthy friend, FERDINAND: a very _Helluo Librorum_. It\r\nwas on a warm evening in summer--about an hour after sunset--that\r\nFerdinand made his way towards a small inn, or rather village\r\nalehouse, that stood on a gentle eminence, skirted by a luxuriant\r\nwood. He entered, oppressed with heat and fatigue; but observed, on\r\nwalking up to the porch \"smothered with honey-suckles\" (as I think\r\nCowper expresses it), that every thing around bore the character of\r\nneatness and simplicity. The holy-oaks were tall and finely variegated\r\nin blossom: the pinks were carefully tied up: and roses of all colours\r\nand fragrance stood around, in a compacted form, like a body-guard,\r\nforbidding the rude foot of trespasser to intrude. Within, Ferdinand\r\nfound corresponding simplicity and comfort.\r\n\r\nThe \"gude\" man of the house was spending the evening with a neighbour;\r\nbut poached eggs and a rasher of bacon, accompanied with a flagon of\r\nsparkling ale, gave our guest no occasion to doubt the hospitality of\r\nthe house, on account of the absence of its master. A little past ten,\r\nafter reading some dozen pages in a volume of Sir Egerton Brydges's\r\n_Censura Literaria_, which he happened to carry about him, and\r\npartaking pretty largely of the aforesaid eggs and ale, Ferdinand\r\ncalled for his candle, and retired to repose. His bed-room was small,\r\nbut neat and airy: at one end, and almost facing the window, there was\r\na pretty large closet, with the door open: but Ferdinand was too\r\nfatigued to indulge any curiosity about what it might contain.\r\n\r\nHe extinguished his candle, and sank upon his bed to rest. The heat of\r\nthe evening seemed to increase. He became restless; and, throwing off\r\nhis quilt, and drawing his curtain aside, turned towards the window,\r\nto inhale the last breeze which yet might be wafted from the\r\nneighbouring heath. But no zephyr was stirring. On a sudden, a broad\r\nwhite flash of lightning--(nothing more than summer heat) made our\r\nbibliomaniac lay his head upon his pillow, and turn his eyes in an\r\nopposite direction. The lightning increased--and one flash, more vivid\r\nthan the rest, illuminated the interior of the closet, and made\r\nmanifest--_an old mahogany Book-Case_, STORED WITH BOOKS. Up started\r\nFerdinand, and put his phosphoric treasures into action. He lit his\r\nmatch, and trimmed his candle, and rushed into the closet--no longer\r\nmindful of the heavens--which now were in a blaze with the summer\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nThe book-case was guarded both with glass and brass wires--and the\r\nkey--no where to be found! Hapless man!--for, to his astonishment, he\r\nsaw _Morte d'Arthur_, printed by _Caxton_--_Richard Coeur de Lyon_,\r\nby _W. de Worde_--_The Widow Edyth_, by _Pynson_--and, towering above\r\nthe rest, a LARGE PAPER copy of the original edition of _Prince's\r\nWorthies of Devon_; while, lying transversely at top, reposed _John\r\nWeever's Epigrams_, \"The spirit of Captain Cox is here revived\"--exclaimed\r\nFerdinand--while, on looking above, he saw a curious set of old plays,\r\nwith _Dido, Queen of Carthage_, at the head of them! What should he\r\ndo? No key: no chance of handling such precious tomes--'till the\r\nmorning light, with the landlord, returned! He moved backwards and\r\nforwards with a hurried step--prepared his pocket knife to cut out the\r\npanes of glass, and untwist the brazen wires--but a \"_prick of\r\nconscience_\" made him desist from carrying his wicked design into\r\nexecution. Ferdinand then advanced towards the window; and throwing it\r\nopen, and listening to the rich notes of a concert of nightingales,\r\nforgot the cause of his torments--'till, his situation reminding him\r\nof \"_The Churl and the Bird_,\" he rushed with renewed madness into the\r\ncupboard--then searched for the bell--but, finding none, he made all\r\nsorts of strange noises. The landlady rose, and, conceiving robbers to\r\nhave broken into the stranger's room, came and demanded the cause of\r\nthe disturbance.\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said Ferdinand, \"is there no possibility of inspecting the\r\n_books_ in the _cupboard_--where is the key?\" \"Alack, sir,\" rejoined\r\nthe landlady, \"what is there that thus disturbs you in the sight of\r\nthose books? Let me shut the closet-door and take away the key of it,\r\nand you will then sleep in peace.\" \"Sleep in _peace_!\" resumed\r\nFerdinand--\"sleep in _wretchedness_, you mean! I can have no peace\r\nunless you indulge me with the key of the book-case. To whom do such\r\ngems belong?\" \"Sir, they are not stolen goods.\"--\"Madam, I ask\r\npardon--I did not mean to question their being honest property--but\"--\"Sir,\r\nthey are not mine or my husband's.\" \"Who, madam, who is the lucky\r\nowner?\" \"An elderly gentleman of the name of--Sir, I am not at liberty\r\nto mention his name--but they belong to an elderly gentleman.\" \"Will\r\nhe part with them--where does he live? Can you introduce me to\r\nhim?\"--The good woman soon answered all Ferdinand's rapid queries, but\r\nthe result was by no means satisfactory to him.\r\n\r\nHe learnt that these uncommonly scarce and precious volumes belonged\r\nto an ancient gentleman, whose name was studiously concealed; but who\r\nwas in the habit of coming once or twice a week, during the autumn, to\r\nsmoke his pipe, and lounge over his books: sometimes making extracts\r\nfrom them, and sometimes making observations in the margin with a\r\npencil. Whenever a very curious passage occurred, he would take out a\r\nsmall memorandum book, and put on a pair of large tortoise-shell\r\nspectacles, with powerful magnifying glasses, in order to insert this\r\npassage with particular care and neatness. He usually concluded his\r\nevening amusements by sleeping in the very bed in which Ferdinand had\r\nbeen lying.\r\n\r\nSuch intelligence only sharpened the curiosity, and increased the\r\nrestlessness, of poor Ferdinand. He retired to this said\r\nbibliomaniacal bed, but not to repose. The morning sun-beams, which\r\nirradiated the book-case with complete effect, shone upon his pallid\r\ncountenance and thoughtful brow. He rose at five: walked in the\r\nmeadows till seven; returned and breakfasted--stole up stairs to take\r\na farewell peep at his beloved _Morte d'Arthur_--sighed \"three times\r\nand more\"--paid his reckoning; apologised for the night's adventure;\r\ntold the landlady he would shortly come and visit her again, and try\r\nto pay his respects to the anonymous old gentleman. \"Meanwhile,\" said\r\nhe, \"I will leave no bookseller's shop in the neighbourhood unvisited,\r\n'till I gain intelligence of his name and character.\" The landlady\r\neyed him steadily; took a pinch of snuff with a significant air; and,\r\nreturning, with a smile of triumph, to her kitchen, thanked her stars\r\nthat she had got rid of such a madman!\r\n\r\nLadies and gentlemen, I have done.\r\n\r\nLIS. And creditably done, too!\r\n\r\nALMAN. If this be a specimen of your previous conversation, we know\r\nnot what we have lost by our absence. But I suspect, that the\r\nprincipal ingredient of poetry, fiction, has a little aided in the\r\nembellishment of your story.\r\n\r\nBELIN. This is not very gallant or complimentary on your part,\r\nAlmansa. I harbour no suspicion of its verity; for marvellous things\r\nhave been told me, by my brother, of the whimsical phrensies of\r\nbook-fanciers.\r\n\r\nLOREN. If you will only listen a little to Lysander's _sequel_, you\r\nwill hear almost equally marvellous things; which I suspect my\r\nliberally minded sister, Almansa, will put down to the score of\r\npoetical embellishment. But I see she is conscious of her treasonable\r\naspersions of the noble character of bibliomaniacs, and is only\r\nanxious for Lysander to resume.\r\n\r\nALMAN. Sir, I entreat you to finish your HISTORY OF BIBLIOMANIACS.\r\nYour friend, Philemon, has regaled us with an entertaining episode,\r\nand you have probably, by this time, recovered strength sufficient to\r\nproceed with the main story.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Madam, I am equally indebted to your brother for his care of\r\nthe body, and to my friend for his recreation of the mind. The\r\nmidnight hour, I fear, is swiftly approaching.\r\n\r\nLOREN. It is yet at a considerable distance. We have nearly reached\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century, and you may surely carry on your\r\nreminiscential exertions to the close of the same. By that time, we\r\nmay be disposed for our nightcaps.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Unheeded be the moments and hours which are devoted to the\r\ncelebration of eminent BOOK-COLLECTORS! Let the sand roll down the\r\nglass as it will; let \"the chirping on each thorn\" remind us of\r\nAurora's saucy face peering above the horizon! in such society, and\r\nwith such a subject of discussion, who--\r\n\r\nLIS. Lysander brightens as his story draws to a close: his colouring\r\nwill be more vivid than ever.\r\n\r\nBELIND. Tell me--are bibliographers usually thus eloquent? They have\r\nbeen described to me as a dry, technical race of mortals--quoting only\r\ntitle-pages and dates.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Madam, believe not the malicious evidence of book-heretics.\r\nLet ladies, like yourself and your sister, only make their appearance\r\nwith a choice set of bibliomaniacs, at this time of night, and if the\r\nmost interesting conversation be not the result--I have very much\r\nunder-rated the colloquial powers of my brethren. But you shall hear.\r\n\r\nWe left off with lauding the bibliomaniacal celebrity of Harley, Earl\r\nof Oxford. Before the dispersion of his grand collection, died JOHN\r\nBRIDGES,[378] a gentleman, a scholar, and a notorious book-collector.\r\nThe catalogue of his books is almost the first classically arranged\r\none in the eighteenth century: and it must be confessed that the\r\ncollection was both curious and valuable. Bridges was succeeded by\r\nANTHONY COLLINS,[379] the Free Thinker; a character equally strange\r\nand unenviable. Book-fanciers now and then bid a few shillings, for a\r\ncopy of the catalogue of his library; and some sly free-thinkers, of\r\nmodern date, are not backward in shewing a sympathy in their\r\npredecessor's fame, by the readiness with which they bid a\r\nhalf-guinea, or more, for a _priced copy_ of it.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 378: _Bibliothecæ Bridgesianæ Catalogus_: or a\r\n     Catalogue of the Library of JOHN BRIDGES, Esq., consisting\r\n     of above 4000 books and manuscripts in all Languages and\r\n     Faculties; particularly in Classics and History; and\r\n     especially the History and Antiquities of Great Britain and\r\n     Ireland, &c., London, 1725, 8vo. Two different catalogues of\r\n     this valuable collection of books were printed. The one was\r\n     analysed, or a _catalogue raisonné_, to which was prefixed a\r\n     print of a Grecian portico, &c., with ornaments and statues:\r\n     the other (expressly for the sale) was an indigested and\r\n     extremely confused one--to which was prefixed a print,\r\n     designed and engraved by A. Motte, of an oak felled, with a\r\n     number of men cutting down and carrying away its branches;\r\n     illustrative of the following Greek Motto inscribed on a\r\n     scroll above--[Greek: Dryos pesousês pas anêr xyleuetai];\r\n     \"An affecting momento (says Mr. Nichols, very justly, in his\r\n     _Anecdotes of Bowyer_, p. 557) to the collectors of great\r\n     libraries, who cannot, or do not, leave them to some public\r\n     accessible repository.\" My friend, Dr. Gosset, was once so\r\n     fortunate as to pick up for me a _large paper_ copy of the\r\n     analysed catalogue, bound in old blue morocco, and ruled\r\n     with red lines, for 4_s._!--\"Happy day!\"]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 379: In the year 1730-1, there was sold by auction\r\n     at St. Paul's Coffee House, in St. Paul's Church Yard\r\n     (beginning every evening at five o'clock), the library of\r\n     the celebrated Free Thinker, ANTHONY COLLINS, Esq.\r\n     \"Containing a collection of several thousand volumes in\r\n     Greek, Latin, English, French, and Spanish; in divinity,\r\n     history, antiquity, philosophy, husbandry, and all polite\r\n     literature: and especially many curious travels and voyages;\r\n     and many rare and valuable pamphlets.\" This collection,\r\n     which is divided into _two parts_ (the first containing 3451\r\n     articles, the second 3442), is well worthy of being\r\n     consulted by the theologian who is writing upon any\r\n     controverted point of divinity; as there are articles in it\r\n     of the rarest occurrence. The singular character of its\r\n     owner and of his works is well known: he was at once the\r\n     friend and the opponent of Locke and Clarke, who both were\r\n     anxious for the conversion of a character of such strong,\r\n     but misguided, talents. The former, on his death-bed, wrote\r\n     Collins a letter to be delivered to him after his decease,\r\n     which was full of affection and good advice.]\r\n\r\nWe may here but slightly allude to the bibliographical reputation of\r\nMAITTAIRE, as so much was said of him the day before yesterday.[380]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 380: The reader will find some account of\r\n     MAITTAIRE'S bibliographical labours at p. 47, ante; and of\r\n     his editions of the ancient Classics, at p. 442, vol. ii.,\r\n     of my _Introduction to the Knowledge of rare and valuable\r\n     editions of the Greek and Latin Classics_. He need here only\r\n     be informed that Maittaire's books were sold by auction in\r\n     November, 1748, and January, 1749; the catalogue of them\r\n     forming _two parts_, with one of these dates affixed to\r\n     each. The collection must have been uncommonly numerous; and\r\n     of their intrinsic value the reader will best judge by the\r\n     following extract from the \"Advertisement,\" by Cock the\r\n     auctioneer, at the back of the title-page: \"tho' the books,\r\n     in their present condition, make not the most ostentatious\r\n     appearance, yet, like the late worthy possessor of them,\r\n     however plain their outside may be, they contain within an\r\n     invaluable treasure of ingenuity and learning. In fine, this\r\n     is (after fifty years' diligent search and labour in\r\n     collecting) THE ENTIRE LIBRARY OF MR. MAITTAIRE; whose\r\n     judgement in the choice of books, as it ever was confessed,\r\n     so are they, undoubtedly, far beyond whatever I can attempt\r\n     to say in their praise. In exhibiting them thus to the\r\n     public, I comply with the will of my deceased friend; and in\r\n     printing the catalogue from his OWN COPY just as he left it\r\n     (tho' by so doing it is the more voluminous) I had an\r\n     opportunity, not only of doing the justice I owe to his\r\n     memory, but also of gratifying the curious.\" I incline\r\n     strongly to think there were no copies of this catalogue\r\n     printed upon large paper. When priced, the usual copy brings\r\n     a fair round sum.]\r\n\r\nBELIN. All this may be very learned and just. But of these gentlemen I\r\nfind no account in the fashionable necrologies.\r\n\r\nLOREN. Only wait a little, and Lysander will break forth with the\r\nmention of some transcendental bibliomaniac.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Yes, ever renowned RICHARD MEAD![381] thy _pharmacopæal_\r\nreputation is lost in the blaze of thy _bibliomaniacal_ glory!\r\nÆsculapius may plant his herbal crown round thy brow, and Hygeia may\r\nscatter her cornucopia of roses at thy feet--but what are these\r\nthings compared with the homage offered thee by the Gesners,\r\nBaillets, and Le Longs, of old? What avail even the roseate blushes of\r\nthousands, whom thy medical skill, may have snatched from a premature\r\ngrave--compared with the life, vigour, animation and competition which\r\nthy example infused into the BOOK-WORLD!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 381: It is almost impossible to dwell on the\r\n     memory of THIS GREAT MAN, without emotions of\r\n     delight--whether we consider him as an eminent physician, a\r\n     friend to literature, or a collector of books, pictures, and\r\n     coins. Benevolence, magnanimity, and erudition were the\r\n     striking features of his character. His house was the\r\n     general receptacle of men of genius and talent, and of every\r\n     thing beautiful, precious, and rare. His curiosities,\r\n     whether books, or coins, or pictures, were freely laid open\r\n     to the public; and the enterprising student, and experienced\r\n     antiquary, alike found amusement and a courteous reception.\r\n     He was known to all foreigners of intellectual distinction,\r\n     and corresponded both with the artisan and the potentate.\r\n     The great patron of literature, and the leader of his\r\n     profession, it was hardly possible, as Lysander has well\r\n     observed, \"for modest merit if properly introduced to him,\r\n     to depart unrewarded or ungratified.\" The clergy, and, in\r\n     general, all men of learning, received his advice\r\n     gratuitously; and his doors were open every morning to the\r\n     most indigent, whom he frequently assisted with money.\r\n     Although his income, from his professional practice, was\r\n     very considerable, he died by no means a rich man--so large\r\n     were the sums which he devoted to the encouragement of\r\n     literature and the fine arts! The sale of Dr. Mead's _Books_\r\n     commenced on the 18th of November, 1754, and again on the\r\n     7th of April, 1755: lasting together 57 days. The sale of\r\n     the _prints_ and _drawings_ continued 14 nights.

The _Spira Virgil_, of 1470, _Pfintzing's\r\n     Tewrdanchk's_, 1527, _Brandt's Stultifera Navis_, 1498, and\r\n     the _Aldine Petrarch_, of 1501, ALL UPON VELLUM. The large\r\n     paper _Olivet's Cicero_ was purchased by Dr. Askew, for\r\n     14_l._ 14_s._, and was sold again at his sale for 36_l._\r\n     15_s._ The King of France bought the editio princeps of\r\n     _Pliny Senior_ for 11_l._ 11_s._: and Mr. Wilcock, a\r\n     bookseller, bought the magnificently illuminated _Pliny by\r\n     Jenson_, of 1472, for 18_l._ 18_s._: of which Maittaire has\r\n     said so many fine things. The _French_ books, and all the\r\n     works upon the _Fine Arts_, were of the first rarity and\r\n     value, and bound in a sumptuous manner. Winstanley's\r\n     _Prospects of Audley End_ brought 50_l._ An amusing account\r\n     of some of the pictures will be found in Mr. Beloe's\r\n     _Anecdotes of Literature and scarce Books_, vol. i., 166,\r\n     71. But consult also _Nichols's Anecdotes of Bowyer_, p.\r\n     225, &c. Of the catalogue of Dr. Mead's books, there were\r\n     only six copies printed upon _large paper_. See _Bibl.\r\n     Lort_, no. 1149. I possess one of these copies, uncut and\r\n     priced. Dr. MEAD had parted, in his life-time, to the\r\n     present king's father, with several miniature pictures of\r\n     great value (Walpole Anec., vol. i., 165) by Isaac Oliver\r\n     and Holbein, which are now in his majesty's collection. Dr.\r\n     Askew had purchased his Greek MSS. for 500_l._ Pope has\r\n     admirably well said,\r\n\r\n          \"Rare _monkish manuscripts_ for HEARNE alone,\r\n          And _Books_ FOR MEAD, and _butterflies_ for SLOANE.\"\r\n\r\n          _Epistle_ iv.\r\n\r\n     Upon which his commentator, Warburton, thus observes: \"These\r\n     were two eminent physicians; the one had an excellent\r\n     library, the other the finest collection in Europe of\r\n     natural curiosities.\" For nearly half a century did Dr. Mead\r\n     pursue an unrivalled career in his profession. He was\r\n     (perhaps \"thrice\") presented with the presidentship of the\r\n     College of Physicians, which he (\"thrice\") refused. One year\r\n     it is said he made 7000_l._, a great sum in his time! His\r\n     regular emoluments were between 5000_l._ and 6000_l._ per\r\n     annum. He died on the 25th of February, 1754, in the 81st\r\n     year of his age. On his death, Dr. ASKEW, who seems to have\r\n     had a sort of filial veneration for his character, and whose\r\n     pursuits were in every respect congenial with Dr. Mead's,\r\n     presented the College of Physicians with a marble bust of\r\n     him, beautifully executed by Roubilliac, and for which he\r\n     paid the sculptor 100_l._ A whimsical anecdote is connected\r\n     with the execution of this bust. Roubilliac agreed with Dr.\r\n     Askew for 50_l._: the doctor found it so highly finished\r\n     that he paid him for it 100_l._ The sculptor said this was\r\n     not enough, and brought in a bill for 108_l._ 2_s._ Dr.\r\n     Askew paid this demand, even to the odd shillings, and then\r\n     enclosed the receipt to Mr. Hogarth, to produce at the next\r\n     meeting of artists. Nichols's _Anec. of Bowyer_, p. 580. \"I\r\n     cannot help,\" says Mr. Edwards, the late ornithologist,\r\n     \"informing succeeding generations that they may see the\r\n     _real features_ of Dr. Mead in this bust: for I, who was as\r\n     well acquainted with his face as any man living, do\r\n     pronounce this bust of him to be so like that, as often as I\r\n     see it, my mind is filled with the strongest idea of the\r\n     original.\" Hearne speaks of the MEADEAN FAMILY with proper\r\n     respect, in his _Alured de Beverly_, p. XLV.; and in _Walter\r\n     Hemingford_, vol. i., XXXV. In his _Gulielmus Nubrigensis_,\r\n     vol. iii., p. 744 (note), he says of our illustrious\r\n     bibliomaniac:--\"that most excellent physician, and truly\r\n     great man, Dr. Richard Mead, to whom I am eternally\r\n     obliged.\" There is an idle story somewhere told of Dr.\r\n     Mead's declining the acceptance of a challenge to fight with\r\n     swords--alleging his want of skill in the art of fencing:\r\n     but this seems to be totally void of authority. Thus far,\r\n     concerning Dr. Mead, from the first edition of this work,\r\n     and the paper entitled \"The Director.\" The following\r\n     particulars, which I have recently learnt of the MEAD\r\n     FAMILY, from John Nicholl, Esq., my neighbour at Kensington,\r\n     and the maternal grandson of the Doctor, may be thought well\r\n     worth subjoining. MATTHEW MEAD, his father, was a clergyman.\r\n     He gave up his living at Stepney in 1662; which was\r\n     afterwards divided into the four fine livings now in the\r\n     gift of Brazen-Nose College, Oxford. His parishioners built\r\n     him a chapel; but he retired to a farm in the country, and\r\n     had the reputation of handling a bullock as well as any\r\n     butcher in the county. He went abroad in the reign of James\r\n     II., and had his sons, Samuel and Richard, educated under\r\n     Grævius. SAMUEL MEAD, _his brother_, was a distinguished\r\n     Chancery barrister, and got his 4000_l._ per ann.; his\r\n     cronies were Wilbraham and Lord Harcourt. These, with a few\r\n     other eminent barristers, used to meet at a coffee-house,\r\n     and drink their favourite, and then fashionable,\r\n     liquor--called _Bishop_, which consisted of red wine, lemon,\r\n     and sugar. Samuel was a shy character, and loved privacy. He\r\n     had a good country house, and handsome chambers in Lincoln's\r\n     Inn, and kept a carriage for his sister's use, having his\r\n     coachmaker's arms painted upon the panel. What is very\r\n     characteristic of the modesty of his profession, he\r\n     pertinaciously refused a silk gown! A word or two remains to\r\n     be said of our illustrious bibliomaniac RICHARD. His brother\r\n     left him 30,000_l._, and giving full indulgence to his noble\r\n     literary feelings, the Doctor sent Carte, the historian, to\r\n     France, to rummage for MSS. of _Thuanus_, and to restore the\r\n     castrated passages which were not originally published for\r\n     fear of offending certain families. He made Buckley, the\r\n     editor, procure the best _ink and paper_ from Holland, for\r\n     this edition of Thuanus, which was published at his own\r\n     expense; and the Doctor was remarkably solicitous that\r\n     nothing of exterior pomp and beauty should be wanting in the\r\n     publication. The result verified his most sanguine\r\n     expectation; for a finer edition of a valuable historian has\r\n     never seen the light. Dr. Ward, says Mr. Nichols, is\r\n     supposed to have written Mead's Latin, but the fact is not\r\n     so; or it is exclusively applicable to the _later_ pieces of\r\n     Mead. The Doctor died in his 83rd year (and in full\r\n     possession of his mental powers), from a fall occasioned by\r\n     the negligence of a servant. He was a great _diagnostic_\r\n     physician; and, when he thought deeply, was generally\r\n     correct in judging of the disorder by the appearance of the\r\n     countenance.]\r\n\r\nThe tears shed by virtuous bibliomaniacs at Harley's death were\r\nspeedily wiped away, when the recollection of thine, and of thy\r\ncontemporary's, FOLKES'S[382] fame, was excited in their bosoms.\r\nIllustrious Bibliomaniacs! your names and memories will always live in\r\nthe hearts of noble-minded Literati: the treasures of your Museums and\r\nLibraries--your liberal patronage and ever-active exertions in the\r\ncause of VIRTU--whether connected with coins, pictures, or books--can\r\nnever be banished, at least, from my grateful mind:--And if, at this\r\nsolemn hour, when yonder groves and serpentine walks are sleeping in\r\nthe quiet of moon-light, your spirits could be seen placidly to flit\r\nalong, I would burst from this society--dear and congenial as it\r\nis--to take your last instructions, or receive your last warnings,\r\nrespecting the rearing of a future age of bibliomaniacs!

The works on\r\n     natural history, coins, medals, inscriptions, and on the\r\n     fine arts in general, formed the most valuable\r\n     department--those on the Greek, Latin, and English classics\r\n     were comparatively of inferior importance. It is a great\r\n     pity the catalogue was not better digested; or the books\r\n     classed according to the nature of their contents. The\r\n     following prices, for some of the more rare and interesting\r\n     articles, will amuse a bibliographer of the present day. The\r\n     chronicles of Fabian, Hall, and Grafton, did not,\r\n     altogether, bring quite 2_l._, though the copies are\r\n     described as perfect and fair. There seems to have been a\r\n     fine set of Sir Wm. Dugdale's Works (Nos. 3074-81) in 13\r\n     vols., which, collectively, produced about 30 guineas! At\r\n     the present day, they are worth about 250_l._--In _Spanish\r\n     literature_, the history of South America, by John Duan and\r\n     Ant. di Ulloa, Madr., fol., in 5 vols., was sold for 5_l._:\r\n     a fine large paper copy of the description of the monastery\r\n     of St. Lorenzo, and the Escorial, Madr., 1657, brought 1_l._\r\n     2_s._; de Lastanosa's Spanish medals, Huesca, fol., 1645,\r\n     2_l._ 2_s._--In _English_, the first edition of Shakspeare,\r\n     1623, which is now what a French bibliographer would say,\r\n     \"presque introuvable,\" produced the sum of 3_l._ 3_s._; and\r\n     Fuller's Worthies, 18_s._!----_Fine Arts, Antiquities, and\r\n     Voyages._ Sandrart's works, in 9 folio volumes (of which a\r\n     fine perfect copy is now rarely to be met with, and of very\r\n     great value) were sold for 13_l._ 13_s._ only: Desgodetz\r\n     Roman edifices, Paris, 1682, 4_l._ 10_s._ Galleria\r\n     Giustiniano, 2 vols., fol., 13_l._ 13_s._ Le Brun's Voyages\r\n     in Muscovy, &c., in large paper, 4_l._ 4_s._ De Rossi's\r\n     Raccolta de Statue, &c., Rom., 1704, 6_l._ 10_s._ Medailles\r\n     du Regne de Louis le Grand: de l'Imp. Roy. 1. p. fol., 1702,\r\n     5_l._ 15_s._ 6_d._----The works on _Natural History_ brought\r\n     still higher prices: but the whole, from the present\r\n     depreciation of money, and increased rarity of the articles,\r\n     would now bring thrice the sums then given.--Of the _Greek\r\n     and Latin Classics_, the Pliny of 1469 and 1472 were sold to\r\n     Dr. Askew, for 11_l._ 11_s._ and 7_l._ 17_s._ 6_d._ At the\r\n     Doctor's sale they brought 43_l._ and 23_l._, although the\r\n     first was lately sold (A.D. 1805) among some duplicates of\r\n     books belonging to the British Museum, at a much lower\r\n     price: the copy was, in fact, neither large nor beautiful.\r\n     Those in Lord Spencer's, and the Hunter and Cracherode\r\n     collections, are greatly superior, and would each bring more\r\n     than double the price. From a priced copy of the sale\r\n     catalogue, upon _large paper_, and uncut, in my possession,\r\n     I find that the amount of the sale, consisting of 5126\r\n     articles, was 3091_l._ 6_s._ The _Prints, and Drawings_ of\r\n     Mr. Folkes occupied a sale of 8 days: and his _pictures_,\r\n     _gems_, _coins_, and _mathematical instruments_, of five\r\n     days. Mr. MARTIN FOLKES may justly be ranked among the most\r\n     useful, as well as splendid, literary characters, of which\r\n     this country can boast. He appears to have imbibed, at a\r\n     very early age, an extreme passion for science and\r\n     literature; and to have distinguished himself so much at the\r\n     University of Cambridge, under the able tuition of Dr.\r\n     Laughton, that, in his 23rd year, he was admitted a Fellow\r\n     of the Royal Society. About two years afterwards he was\r\n     chosen one of the council; and rose in succession to the\r\n     chair of the presidentship, which, as Lysander above truly\r\n     says, he filled with a credit and celebrity that has since\r\n     never been surpassed. On this occasion he was told by Dr.\r\n     Jurin, the Secretary, who dedicated to him the 34th vol. of\r\n     the Transactions, that \"the greatest man that ever lived\r\n     (Sir Isaac Newton) singled him out to fill the chair, and to\r\n     preside in the society, when he himself was so frequently\r\n     prevented by indisposition; and that it was sufficient to\r\n     say of him that he was _Sir Isaac's friend_.\" Within a few\r\n     years afterwards, he was elected President of the Society of\r\n     Antiquaries. Two situations, the filling of which may be\r\n     considered as the _ne plus ultra_ of literary distinction.\r\n     Mr. Folkes travelled abroad, with his family, about two\r\n     years and a half, visiting the cities of Rome, Florence, and\r\n     Venice--where he was noticed by almost every person of rank\r\n     and reputation, and whence he brought away many a valuable\r\n     article to enrich his own collection. He was born in the\r\n     year 1690, and died of a second stroke of the palsy, under\r\n     which he languished for three years, in 1754. He seems to\r\n     have left behind him a considerable fortune. Among his\r\n     numerous bequests was one to the Royal Society of 200_l._,\r\n     along with a fine portrait of Lord Bacon, and a large\r\n     cornelian ring, with the arms of the society engraved upon\r\n     it, for the perpetual use of the president and his\r\n     successors in office. The MSS. of his own composition, not\r\n     being quite perfect, were, to the great loss of the learned\r\n     world, ordered by him to be destroyed. The following\r\n     wood-cut portrait is taken from a copper-plate in the\r\n     _Portraits des Hommes Illustres de Denmark_, 4to., 7 parts,\r\n     1746: part 4th, a volume which abounds with a number of\r\n     copper-plate engravings, _worked off_ in a style of uncommon\r\n     clearness and brilliancy. Some of the portraits themselves\r\n     are rather stiff and unexpressive; but the vignettes are\r\n     uniformly tasteful and agreeable. The seven parts are rarely\r\n     found in an equal state of perfection.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration]\r\n\r\n     Dr. Birch has drawn a very just and interesting character of\r\n     this eminent man, which may be found in Nichols's _Anecdotes\r\n     of Bowyer_, pp. 562-7. Mr. Edwards, the late ornithologist,\r\n     has described him in a simple, but appropriate, manner. \"He\r\n     seemed,\" says he, \"to have attained to universal knowledge;\r\n     for, in the many opportunities I have had of being in his\r\n     company, almost every part of science has happened to be the\r\n     subject of discourse, all of which he handled as an adept.\r\n     He was a man of great politeness in his manners, free from\r\n     all pedantry and pride, and, in every respect, the real,\r\n     unaffected, fine gentleman.\"]\r\n\r\nALMAN. Pray keep to this earth, and condescend to notice us mortals of\r\nflesh and blood, who have heard of Dr. Mead, and Martin Folkes, only\r\nas eminently learned and tasteful characters.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. I crave your forgiveness. But Dr. Mead's cabinet of coins,\r\nstatues, and books, was so liberally thrown open for the public\r\ninspection that it was hardly possible for modest merit, if properly\r\nmade known to him, to depart unrewarded or ungratified. Nor does the\r\nrenowned President of the Royal and Antiquarian Societies--Martin\r\nFolkes--merit a less warm eulogy; for he filled these distinguished\r\nsituations with a credit which has never since been surpassed.\r\n\r\nBut there is yet an illustrious tribe to be recorded. We have, first,\r\nRICHARD RAWLINSON,[383] brother of the renowned _Tom Folio_, whose\r\nchoice and tasteful collection of books, as recorded in auctioneering\r\nannals, is deserving of high commendation. But his name and virtues\r\nare better known in the University, to which he was a benefactor, than\r\nto the noisy circles of the metropolis. The sale of ORATOR HENLEY'S\r\nbooks \"followed hard upon\" that of Richard Rawlinson's; and if the\r\nspirit of their owner could, from his \"gilt tub,\" have witnessed the\r\ngrimaces and jokes which marked the sale--with the distorted\r\ncountenances and boisterous laughter which were to be seen on every\r\nside--how it must have writhed under the smart of general ridicule, or\r\nhave groaned under the torture of contemptuous indignation! Peace to\r\nHenley's[384] vexed _manes_!--and similar contempt await the efforts\r\nof all literary quacks and philosophical knaves!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 383: \"BIBLIOTHECA RAWLINSONIANA, _sive Catalogus\r\n     Librorum Richardi Rawlinson_, LL.D. Qui prostabunt Venales\r\n     sub hasta, Apud Samuelem Baker, In Vico dicto York-street,\r\n     Covent Garden, Londoni, Die Lunæ 29 Marti MDCCLVI.\" With the\r\n     following whimsical Greek motto in the title-page:\r\n\r\n          [Greek: Kai gar o taôs dia to spanion thaumazetai].\r\n\r\n          EUBULUS.\r\n\r\n          (\"The peacock is admired on account of its rarity.\")\r\n\r\n     This valuable library must have contained nearly 25,000\r\n     volumes, multiplying the number of articles (9405) by 3--the\r\n     usual mode of calculation. Unfortunately, as was the case\r\n     with Dr. Mead's and Mr. Folkes's, the books were not\r\n     arranged according to any particular classification. Old\r\n     black-letter English were mixed with modern Italian, French,\r\n     and Latin; and novels and romances interspersed with\r\n     theology and mathematics. An _alphabetical_ arrangement, be\r\n     the books of whatever kind they may, will in general obviate\r\n     the inconvenience felt from such an undigested plan; and it\r\n     were \"devoutly to be wished,\" by all true bibliographers,\r\n     that an act of parliament should pass for the due observance\r\n     of this alphabetical order. We all know our A, B, C, but\r\n     have not all analytical heads; or we may differ in our ideas\r\n     of analysis. The scientific and alphabetical _united_ is\r\n     certainly better; like Mr. Harris's excellent catalogue,\r\n     noticed at p. 99, ante. The \"_Méthode pour dresser une\r\n     bibliothéque_,\" about which De Bure, Formey, and Peignot\r\n     have so solemnly argued, is not worth a moment's discussion.\r\n     Every man likes to be his own librarian, as well as \"his own\r\n     broker.\" But to return to Dr. Rawlinson's collection. On\r\n     examining a priced catalogue of it, which now lies before\r\n     me, I have not found any higher sum offered for a work than\r\n     4_l._ 1_s._ for a collection of fine prints, by Aldegrever.\r\n     (No. 9405.) The Greek and Latin Classics, of which there\r\n     were few _Editiones Principes_, or on _large paper_, brought\r\n     the usual sums given at that period. The old English\r\n     black-letter books, which were pretty thickly scattered\r\n     throughout the collection, were sold for exceedingly low\r\n     prices--if the copies were perfect. Witness the following:\r\n\r\n                                                      £ _s._ _d._\r\n     The Newe Testament in English, 1500              0   2   9\r\n     The Ymage of both Churches, after the Revelation\r\n       of St. John, by Bale, 1550                     0   1   6\r\n     The boke called the Pype or Tonne of Perfection,\r\n       by Richard Whytforde, 1553                     0   1   9\r\n     The Visions of Pierce Plowman, 1561              0   2   0\r\n     The Creede of Pierce Plowman, 1532               0   1   6\r\n     The Bookes of Moses, in English, 1530            0   3   9\r\n     Bale's Actes of English Votaryes, 1550           0   1   3\r\n     The Boke of Chivalrie, by Caxton                 0  11   0\r\n     The Boke of St. Alban's, by W. de Worde          1   1   0\r\n\r\n     These are only very few of the rare articles in English\r\n     literature; of the whole of which (perhaps upwards of 200 in\r\n     number) I believe the boke of St. Albans brought the highest\r\n     sum. Hence it will be seen that this was not the age of\r\n     curious research into the productions of our ancestors.\r\n     Shakspeare had not then appeared in a proper _variorum\r\n     edition_. Theobald, Pope, and Warburton, had not\r\n     investigated the =black-letter= lore of ancient English\r\n     writers for the illustration of their favourite author. This\r\n     was reserved for Capell, Farmer, Steevens, Malone, Chalmers,\r\n     Reed, and Douce: and it is expressly to these latter\r\n     gentlemen (for Johnson and Hanmer were very sparing, or very\r\n     shy, of the black-letter), that we are indebted for the\r\n     present spirit of research into the works of our ancestors.\r\n     The sale of the _books_ lasted 50 days. There was a second\r\n     sale of _pamphlets, books of prints, &c._, in the following\r\n     year, which lasted 10 days: and this was immediately\r\n     succeeded by a sale of the doctor's _single prints and\r\n     drawings_, which continued 8 days. Dr. Rawlinson's\r\n     benefactions to Oxford, besides his Anglo-Saxon endowment at\r\n     St. John's College, were very considerable; including,\r\n     amongst other curiosities, _a series of medals of the\r\n     Popes_, which the Doctor supposed to be one of the most\r\n     complete collections in Europe; and a great number of\r\n     valuable MSS., which he directed to be safely locked up, and\r\n     not to be opened till seven years after his decease. He died\r\n     on the 6th of April, 1755. To St. John's College, where he\r\n     had been a gentleman commoner, Dr. Rawlinson left the bulk\r\n     of his estate, amounting to near 700_l._ a year: _a plate of\r\n     Abp. Laud_, 31 volumes of _Parliamentary Journals and\r\n     Debates_, a set of _Rymer's Foedera_, his _Greek_,\r\n     _Roman_, and _English coins_, not given to the Bodleian\r\n     Library; all his plates engraved at the expense of the\r\n     Society of Antiquaries; his diploma, and his _heart_; which\r\n     latter is placed in a beautiful urn against the chapel wall,\r\n     with this inscription:\r\n\r\n          Urbi thesaurus, ibi cor.\r\n          RIC.

The title of the Sale\r\n     Catalogue is as follows:----\"_A Catalogue of the original\r\n     MSS. and manuscript collections of the late_ Reverend Mr.\r\n     JOHN HENLEY, A.M., Independent Minister of the Oratory, &c.,\r\n     in which are included sundry collections of the late Mons.\r\n     des Maizeaux, the learned editor of Bayle, &c., Mr. Lowndes,\r\n     author of the Report for the Amendment of Silver coins, &c.,\r\n     Dr. Patrick Blair, Physician at Boston, and F.R.S., &c.\r\n     Together with original letters and papers of State,\r\n     addressed to Henry d'Avenant, Esq., her Britannic Majesty's\r\n     Envoy at Francfort, from 1703 to 1708 inclusive.\" Few\r\n     libraries have contained more curious and remarkable\r\n     publications than did this.

After entering into\r\n     orders, he became a preacher in London, and established a\r\n     lecture on Sunday evenings, near Lincoln's-Inn Fields, and\r\n     another on Wednesday evenings, chiefly on political and\r\n     scientific subjects. Each auditor paid one shilling for\r\n     admission. \"He declaimed,\" says Warburton, \"against the\r\n     greatest persons, and occasionally did our poet (Pope) that\r\n     honour. When he was at Cambridge, he began to be uneasy; for\r\n     it shocked him to find he was commanded to believe against\r\n     his own judgment in points of religion, philosophy, &c.: for\r\n     his genius leading him freely to _dispute all propositions_,\r\n     and _call all points to account_, he was impatient under\r\n     those fetters of the free-born mind.\" When he was admitted\r\n     into priest's orders, he thought the examination so short\r\n     and superficial that he considered it \"_not necessary to\r\n     conform to the Christian religion_, in order either to be a\r\n     deacon or priest.\" With these quixotic sentiments he came to\r\n     town; and \"after having, for some years, been a writer for\r\n     the booksellers, he had an ambition to be so for ministers\r\n     of state.\" The only reason he did not rise in the church, we\r\n     are told, \"was the envy of others, and a disrelish\r\n     entertained of him, because _he was not qualified to be a\r\n     complete spaniel_.\" However, he offered the service of his\r\n     pen to two great men, of opinions and interests directly\r\n     opposite: but being rejected by both of them, he set up a\r\n     new project, and styled himself, \"_The restorer of ancient\r\n     eloquence._\" Henley's pulpit, in which he preached, \"was\r\n     covered with velvet, and adorned with gold.\" It is to this\r\n     that Pope alludes, in the first couplet of his second book\r\n     of the Dunciad:\r\n\r\n          High on a gorgeous seat, that far outshone\r\n          HENLEY'S _gilt tub_----\r\n\r\n     \"He had also an altar, and placed over it this extraordinary\r\n     inscription, '_The primitive Eucharist._'\" We are told by\r\n     his friend Welsted (narrative in Oratory Transact. No. 1)\r\n     that \"he had the assurance to form a plan, which no mortal\r\n     _ever thought of_; he had success against all opposition;\r\n     challenged his adversaries to fair disputations, and _none\r\n     would dispute with him_: he wrote, read, and studied, twelve\r\n     hours a day; composed three dissertations a week on all\r\n     subjects; undertook to teach in _one year_ what schools and\r\n     universities teach in _five_: was not terrified by menaces,\r\n     insults, or satires; but still proceeded, matured his bold\r\n     scheme, and put the church and _all that in danger_!\" See\r\n     note to Dunciad, book iii., v. 199. Pope has described this\r\n     extraordinary character with singular felicity of\r\n     expression:\r\n\r\n            But, where each science lifts its modern type,\r\n          Hist'ry her Pot, Divinity her Pipe,\r\n          While proud philosophy repines to shew,\r\n          Dishonest sight! his breeches rent below;\r\n          Imbrown'd with native bronze, lo! Henley stands,\r\n          Tuning his voice and balancing his hands.\r\n          How fluent nonsense trickles from his tongue!\r\n          How sweet the periods, neither said nor sung!\r\n          Still break the benches, Henley! with thy strain,\r\n          While SHERLOCK, HARE, and GIBSON, preach in vain.\r\n          Oh great restorer of the good old stage,\r\n          Preacher at once, and zany of thy age,\r\n          Oh worthy thou, of Egypt's wise abodes,\r\n          A decent priest, where monkeys were the gods!\r\n          But fate with butchers plac'd thy priestly stall,\r\n          Meek modern faith to murder, hack, and mawl;\r\n          And bade thee live, to crown Britannia's praise,\r\n          In TOLAND'S, TINDAL'S, and in WOOLSTON'S days.\r\n\r\n          _Dunciad_, b. iii., v. 190, &c.\r\n\r\n     Bromley, in his catalogue of engraved Portraits, mentions\r\n     _four_ of orator Henley: two of which are inscribed, one by\r\n     Worlidge \"The Orator of Newport Market;\" another (without\r\n     engraver's name) \"A Rationalist.\" There is a floating story\r\n     which I have heard of Henley. He gave out that he would shew\r\n     a new and expeditious method of converting a pair of boots\r\n     into shoes. A great concourse of people attended, expecting\r\n     to see something very marvellous; when Henley mounted his\r\n     \"tub,\" and, holding up a boot, he took a knife, and _cut\r\n     away the leg part of the leather_!]\r\n\r\nThere are, I had almost said, innumerable contemporaneous\r\nbibliomaniacal characters to be described--or rather, lesser stars or\r\nsatellites that move, in their now unperceived orbits, around the\r\ngreat planets of the book world--but, at this protracted hour of\r\ndiscussion, I will not pretend even to mention their names.\r\n\r\nLIS. Yet, go on--unless the female part of the audience be weary--go\r\non describing, by means of your great telescopic powers, every little\r\nwhite star that is sprinkled in this bibliomaniacal _Via Lactea_![385]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 385: With great submission to the \"reminescential\"\r\n     talents of Lysander, he might have devoted one _minute_ to\r\n     the commendation of the very curious library of JOHN HUTTON,\r\n     which was disposed of, by auction, in the same year (1764)\r\n     in which Genl. Dormer's was sold. Hutton's library consisted\r\n     almost entirely of _English Literature_: the rarest books in\r\n     which are printed in the italic type.

It is accurately and handsomely executed, and\r\n     wants only an index to make it truly valuable. The\r\n     collection, moreover, is a very sensible one.

We have just passed over the bar that separates the one half\r\nof the 18th century from the other: and among the ensuing eminent\r\ncollectors, whose brave fronts strike us with respect, is GENERAL\r\nDORMER:[386] a soldier who, I warrant you, had faced full many a\r\ncannon, and stormed many a rampart, with courage and success. But he\r\ncould not resist the raging influence of the Book-Mania: nor could all\r\nhis embrasures and entrenchments screen him from the attacks of this\r\ninsanity. His collection was both select and valuable.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 386: \"_A Catalogue of the genuine and elegant\r\n     Library of the late_ Sir C.C.

This was\r\n     a very choice collection of books; consisting almost\r\n     entirely of French, Greek, Latin, Italian, and Spanish. The\r\n     number of articles did not exceed 3082; and of volumes,\r\n     probably not 7000. The catalogue is neatly printed, and\r\n     copies of it on _large paper_ are exceedingly scarce. Among\r\n     the most curious and valuable articles are the\r\n     following:----no. 599. Les Glorieuses Conquestes de Louis\r\n     le Grand, par Pontault, _en maroquin_. Paris, 1678.

As these\r\n     libraries were collected _abroad_, the catalogues of them\r\n     were arranged in the place here referred to.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 388: I am now to notice, in less romantic manner\r\n     than Lysander, a collection of books, in _English\r\n     Literature_, which, for rarity and value, in a proportionate\r\n     number, have never been equalled; I mean the library of\r\n     JAMES WEST, Esq., _President of the Royal Society_. The sale\r\n     commenced on March 29, 1773, and continued for the\r\n     twenty-three following days. The catalogue was digested by\r\n     Samuel Paterson, a man whose ability in such undertakings\r\n     has been generally allowed. The title was as follows:\r\n     \"BIBLIOTHECA WESTIANA; _A Catalogue of the curious and truly\r\n     valuable library of the late_ JAMES WEST, Esq., _President\r\n     of the Royal Society, deceased_; comprehending a choice\r\n     collection of books in various languages, and upon most\r\n     branches of polite literature: more especially such as\r\n     relate to the history and antiquities of Great Britain and\r\n     Ireland; their early navigators, discoverers, and improvers,\r\n     and the _ancient English literature_: of which there are a\r\n     great number of uncommon books and tracts, elucidated by MS.\r\n     notes and original letters, and embellished with scarce\r\n     portraits and devices, rarely to be found: including the\r\n     works of Caxton, Lettou, Machlinia, the anonymous St. Albans\r\n     school-master, Wynkyn de Worde, Pynson, and the rest of the\r\n     old English typographers. Digested by Samuel Paterson, and\r\n     sold by Messrs. Langfords.\" The title-page is succeeded by\r\n     the\r\n\r\n     PREFACE.\r\n\r\n     \"The following catalogue exhibits a very curious and\r\n     uncommon collection of printed books and tracts. Of British\r\n     History and Antiquities, and of _Rare Old English\r\n     Literature_, the most copious of any which has appeared for\r\n     several years past; formed with great taste, and a thorough\r\n     knowledge of authors and characters, by that judicious\r\n     critic and able antiquary the late JAMES WEST, Esq.,\r\n     President of the Royal Society. Several anonymous writers\r\n     are herein brought to light--many works enlarged and further\r\n     explained by their respective authors and editors--and a far\r\n     greater number illustrated with the MS. notes and\r\n     observations of some of our most respectable antiquaries:\r\n     among whom will be found the revered names of Camden,\r\n     Selden, Spelman, Somner, Dugdale, Gibson, Tanner, Nicolson,\r\n     Gale, Le Neve, Hearne, Anstis, Lewis, St. Amand, Ames,\r\n     Browne, Willis, Stukely, Mr. West, &c. But, above all, the\r\n     intense application and unwearied diligence of the admirable\r\n     Bishop White Kennett, upon the ecclesiastical, monastical,\r\n     constitutional, and topographical history of Great Britain,\r\n     so apparent throughout this collection, furnish matter even\r\n     to astonishment; and are alone sufficient to establish the\r\n     reputation, and to perpetuate the memory, of this\r\n     illustrious prelate, without any other monuments of his\r\n     greatness.\" \"In an age of general inquiry, like the present,\r\n     when studies less interesting give place to the most\r\n     laudable curiosity and thirst after investigating every\r\n     particular relative to the history and literature of our own\r\n     country, nothing less than an elaborate digest of this\r\n     valuable library could be expected; and, as a supplement to\r\n     the history of English literature, more desired.\" \"That task\r\n     the Editor has cheerfully undertaken: and, he flatters\r\n     himself, executed as well as the short time allowed would\r\n     permit. He further hopes, to the satisfaction of such who\r\n     are capable of judging of its utility and importance.\" \"The\r\n     lovers of engraved English portraits (a species of modern\r\n     connoisseurship which appears to have been first started by\r\n     the late noble Earl of Oxford, afterwards taken up by Mr.\r\n     West, Mr. Nicolls, editor of Cromwell's State-Papers, Mr.\r\n     Ames, &c., and since perfected by the Muse of\r\n     Strawberry-Hill, the Rev. Wm. Granger, and some few more\r\n     ingenious collectors) may here look to find a considerable\r\n     number of singular and scarce heads, and will not be\r\n     disappointed in their search.\" Thus much Paterson; who, it\r\n     must be confessed, has promised more than he has performed:\r\n     for the catalogue, notwithstanding it was the _second_ which\r\n     was published (the first being by a different hand, and most\r\n     barbarously compiled) might have exhibited better method and\r\n     taste in its execution. Never were rare and magnificent\r\n     books more huddled together and smothered, as it were, than\r\n     in this catalogue. Let us now proceed to an analysis of Mr.\r\n     West's Collection.\r\n\r\n     1. _Volumes of Miscellaneous Tracts._\r\n\r\n     These volumes extend from no. 148 to 200, from 915 to\r\n     992, from 1201 to 1330, and from no. 1401 to 1480.--Among\r\n     them are some singularly choice and curious articles. The\r\n     following is but an imperfect specimen.\r\n\r\n     NO. 154. Atkyns on Printing, _with the frontispiece_, &c.,\r\n     &c., 4to.\r\n\r\n     164. G. Whetstone's Honorable Profession of a Soldier, 1586,\r\n     &c., 4to.\r\n\r\n     179. Life and death of Wolsey, 1641, &c.\r\n\r\n     183. Nashe's Lenten Stuffe, with the Praise of the Red\r\n     Herring, 1599, &c. 4to. (the three articles together did not\r\n     exceed) £0 12_s._ 0_d._\r\n\r\n     188. A Mornynge Remembrance, had at the Moneth Mynde of the\r\n     Noble Prynces Countesse of Rychmonde, &c. Wynkyn de Worde,\r\n     &c. 4to. 2 2 0\r\n\r\n     194. Oh! read over Dr. John Bridges, for it is a worthie\r\n     Worke, &c. bl. letter, &c. 4to. Strange and fearful Newes\r\n     from Plasto, near Bow, in the house of one Paul Fox, a Silk\r\n     Weaver, where is daily to be seene throwing of Stones,\r\n     Bricbats, Oyster-shells, Bread, cutting his Work in Pieces,\r\n     breaking his Windows, &c. _No date_, 4to. 0 12 6\r\n\r\n     1477. Leylande's Journey and Serche, given of hym as a Newe\r\n     Yeares Gyfte to K. Henry 8th, enlarged by Bale, bl. letter,\r\n     1549, 8vo., (with three other curious articles.) 0 17 6\r\n\r\n     1480. A disclosing of the great Bull and certain Calves that\r\n     he hath gotten, and especially the Monster Bull that roared\r\n     at my Lord Byshop's gate. Bl. letter, pr. by Daye. No date.\r\n     4to.\r\n\r\n     The preceding affords but a very inadequate idea of the\r\n     \"pithie, pleasant, and profitable\" discourses mid tracts\r\n     which abounded among the miscellaneous articles of Mr.\r\n     West's library. Whatever be the defects of modern\r\n     literature, it must be allowed that we are not _quite so\r\n     coarse_ in the _title pages_ of our books.\r\n\r\n     2. _Divinity._\r\n\r\n     This comprehended a vast mass of information, under the\r\n     following general title. Scarce Tracts: Old and New\r\n     Testaments (including almost all the first English editions\r\n     of the New Testament, which are now of the rarest\r\n     occurrence): Commentators: Ecclesiastical History: Polemics:\r\n     Devotions, Catholic and Calvinistical: Enthusiasm:\r\n     Monastical History: Lives of Saints: Fathers: Missionaries:\r\n     Martyrs: Modern Divines and Persons of eminent piety: Free\r\n     Thinkers: Old English Primers: Meditations: Some of the\r\n     earliest Popish and Puritanical Controversy: Sermons by old\r\n     English Divines, &c. In the whole 560 articles: probably\r\n     about 1200 volumes. These general heads are sufficient to\r\n     satisfy the bibliographer that, with such an indefatigable\r\n     collector as was Mr. West, the greater part of the\r\n     theological books must have been extremely rare and curious.\r\n     From so _many Caxtons_, _Wynkyn de Wordes_, _Pynsons, &c._,\r\n     it would be difficult to select a _few_ which should give a\r\n     specimen of the value of the rest. Suffice it to observe\r\n     that such a cluster of _Black Letter Gems_, in this\r\n     department of English literature, has never since been seen\r\n     in any sale catalogue.\r\n\r\n     3. _Education, Languages, Criticism, Classics, Dictionaries,\r\n     Catalogues of Libraries, &c._\r\n\r\n     There were about 700 volumes in these departments. The\r\n     catalogues of English books, from that of Maunsell in 1595,\r\n     to the latest before Mr. West's time, were nearly complete.\r\n     The treatises on education, and translations of the ancient\r\n     classics, comprehended a curious and uncommon collection.\r\n     The Greek and Latin Classics were rather select than rare.\r\n\r\n     4. _English Poetry, Romances, and Miscellanies._\r\n\r\n     This interesting part of the collection comprehended about\r\n     355 articles, or probably about 750 volumes: and, if the\r\n     singularly rare and curious books which may be found _under\r\n     these heads alone_ were now to be concentrated in one\r\n     library, the owner of them might safely demand 4000 guineas\r\n     for such a treasure! I make no doubt but that his MAJESTY is\r\n     the fortunate possessor of the greater number of articles\r\n     under all the foregoing heads.\r\n\r\n     5. _Philosophy, Mathematics, Inventions, Agriculture, and\r\n     Horticulture, Medicine, Cookery, Surgery, &c._\r\n\r\n     Two hundred and forty articles, or about 560 volumes.\r\n\r\n     6. _Chemistry, Natural History, Astrology, Sorcery,\r\n     Gigantology._\r\n\r\n     Probably not more than 100 volumes. The word \"Gigantology,\"\r\n     first introduced by Mr. Paterson, I believe, into the\r\n     English language, was used by the French more than two\r\n     centuries ago. See no. 2198 in the catalogue.\r\n\r\n     7. _History and Antiquities._\r\n\r\n     This comprehended a great number of curious and valuable\r\n     productions, relating both to foreign and domestic\r\n     transactions.\r\n\r\n     8. _Heraldry and Genealogy._\r\n\r\n     An equal number of curious and scarce articles may be found\r\n     under these heads.\r\n\r\n     9. _Antient Legends and Chronicles._\r\n\r\n     To the English antiquary, few departments of literature are\r\n     more interesting than this. Mr. West seems to have paid\r\n     particular attention to it, and to have enriched his library\r\n     with many articles of this description of the rarest\r\n     occurrence. The lovers of Caxton, Fabian, Hardyng, Hall,\r\n     Grafton, and Holinshed, may be highly gratified by\r\n     inspecting the various editions of these old chroniclers. I\r\n     entreat the diligent bibliographer to examine the first 8\r\n     articles of page 209 of the catalogue. Alas! when will such\r\n     gems again glitter at one sale? The fortunate period for\r\n     collectors is gone by: a knowledge of books almost every\r\n     where prevails. At York, at Exeter, at Manchester, and at\r\n     Bristol, as well as in London, this knowledge may be found\r\n     sometimes on the dusty stall, as well as in the splendid\r\n     shop. The worth of books begins to be considered by a\r\n     different standard from that of the quantity of gold on the\r\n     exterior! We are now for \"_drinking deep_,\" as well as\r\n     \"_tasting_!\" But I crave pardon for this digression, and\r\n     lose sight of Mr. West's _uniques_.\r\n\r\n     10. _Topography._\r\n\r\n     Even to a veteran like the late Mr. Gough, such a collection\r\n     as may be found from p. 217 to 239 of the catalogue, would\r\n     be considered a very first-rate acquisition. I am aware that\r\n     the Gothic wainscot and stained glass windows of _Enfield\r\n     Study_ enshrined a still more exquisite topographical\r\n     collection! But we are improved since the days of Mr. West;\r\n     and every body knows to _whom_ these improvements are, in a\r\n     great measure, to be attributed! When I call to mind the\r\n     author of \"_British Topography_\" and \"_Sepulchral\r\n     Monuments_,\" I am not insensible to the taste, diligence,\r\n     and erudition of the \"par nobile fratrum,\" who have\r\n     gratified us with the \"_Environs of London_,\" and the three\r\n     volumes of \"_Magna Britannia_!\" Catalogues of Mr. West's\r\n     library, with the sums for which the books were sold, are\r\n     now found with difficulty, and bring a considerable price.\r\n     The late Mr. G. Baker, who had a surprisingly curious\r\n     collection of priced catalogues, was in possession of the\r\n     _original sale_ one of West's library. It is interleaved,\r\n     and, of course, has the prices and names of the purchasers.\r\n     Mr. Heber has also a priced copy, with the names, which was\r\n     executed by my industrious and accurate predecessor, William\r\n     Herbert, of typographico-antiquarian renown. The number of\r\n     articles, on the whole, was 4653; and of the volumes as many\r\n     articles were single, probably about 8000. _Ample_ as some\r\n     \"pithy\" reader may imagine the foregoing analysis to be, I\r\n     cannot find it in my heart to suffer such a collection, as\r\n     was the _Bibliotheca Westiana_, to be here dismissed in so\r\n     _summary_ a manner. Take, therefore, \"pleasaunt\" reader, the\r\n     following account of the _prices_ for which some of the\r\n     aforesaid book-gems were sold. They are presented to thee as\r\n     a matter of curiosity only; and not as a criterion of their\r\n     present value. And as MASTER CAXTON has of late become so\r\n     popular amongst us, we will see, inter alios, what some of\r\n     the books printed by so \"simple a person\" produced at this\r\n     renowned sale.\r\n\r\n     NO. 564.

Mr. George Nicol, his majesty's bookseller,\r\n     told me, with his usual pleasantry and point, that he got\r\n     abused in the public papers, by Almon and others, for his\r\n     having purchased nearly the whole of the Caxtonian volumes\r\n     in this collection for his Majesty's library. It was said\r\n     abroad that \"a Scotchman had lavished away the king's money\r\n     in buying old black-letter books.\" A pretty specimen of\r\n     _lavishing_ away royal money, truly! There is also another\r\n     thing, connected with these _invaluable_ (I speak as a\r\n     bibliomaniac--and, perhaps, as a metaphysician may think--as\r\n     a fool! but let it pass!) with these invaluable\r\n     purchases:--his Majesty, in his directions to Mr. Nicol,\r\n     forbade any competition with those purchasers who wanted\r\n     books of science and belles-lettres for their _own\r\n     professional_ or _literary_ pursuits: thus using, I ween,\r\n     the powers of his purse in a manner at once merciful and\r\n     wise.--\"O si sic\"--may we say to many a heavy-metalled\r\n     book-auction bibliomaniac of the present day!--Old Tom\r\n     Payne, the father of the respectable Mr. Payne, of\r\n     Pall-Mall, used to tell Mr. Nichol--_pendente hastâ_--that\r\n     he had been \"raising all the CAXTONS!\" \"Many a copy,\" quoth\r\n     he, \"hath _stuck_ in my shop at two guineas!\" Mr. NICHOLS,\r\n     in his amusing biography of Bowyer, has not devoted so large\r\n     a portion of his pages to the description of Mr. West's\r\n     collection, life, and character, as he has to many\r\n     collectors who have been less eminently distinguished in the\r\n     bibliographical world. Whether this was the result of the\r\n     paucity, or incongruity, of his materials, or whether, from\r\n     feelings of delicacy he might not choose to declare all he\r\n     knew, are points into which I have neither right nor\r\n     inclination to enquire. There seems every reason to conclude\r\n     that, from youth, West had an elegant and well-directed\r\n     taste in matters of literature and the fine arts. As early\r\n     as the year 1720, he shewed the munificence of his\r\n     disposition, in these respects, by befriending Hearne with a\r\n     plate for his _Antiquities of Glastonbury_; see p.\r\n     285--which was executed, says Hearne, \"Sumptibus ornatissimi\r\n     amicissimique Juvenis (multis sane nominibus de studiis\r\n     nostris optime meriti) JACOBI WEST,\" &c. So in his pref. to\r\n     _Adam de Domerham de reb. gest. Glaston_:--\"antiquitatum ac\r\n     historiarum nostrarum studiosus in primis--Jacobus West.\" p.\r\n     xx. And in his _Walter Hemingford_, we have:--\"fragmentum,\r\n     ad civitatem Oxoniensem pertinens, admodum egregium, mihi\r\n     dono dedit amicus eximius Jacobus West--is quem alibi\r\n     juvenem ornatissimum appellavi,\" &c., p. 428. How the\r\n     promise of an abundant harvest, in the mature years of so\r\n     excellent a young man, was realized, the celebrity of West,\r\n     throughout Europe, to his dying day, is a sufficient\r\n     demonstration. I conclude with the following; which is\r\n     literally from Nichols's _Anecdotes of Bowyer_. \"James West,\r\n     of Alscott, in the county of Warwick, Esq., M.A., of Baliol\r\n     College, Oxford, (son of Richard West, said to be descended,\r\n     according to family tradition, from Leonard, a younger son\r\n     of Thomas West, Lord Delawar, who died in 1525) was\r\n     representative in parliament for St. Alban's, in 1741; and\r\n     being appointed one of the joint Secretaries of the\r\n     Treasury, held that office till 1762. In 1765 or 1766, his\r\n     old patron the Duke of Newcastle, obtained for him a pension\r\n     of 2000_l._ a year. He was an early member, and one of the\r\n     Vice Presidents, of the Antiquary Society; and was first\r\n     Treasurer, and afterwards President, of the Royal Society.\r\n     He married the daughter and heiress of Sir Thomas Stephens,\r\n     timber merchant, in Southwark, with whom he had a large\r\n     fortune in houses in Rotherhithe; and by whom he had a son,\r\n     James West, Esq., now (1782) of Alscott, one of the Auditors\r\n     of the Land-Tax, and sometime Member of Parliament for\r\n     Boroughbridge, in Yorkshire (who in 1774 married the\r\n     daughter of Christopher Wren, of Wroxhall in Warwickshire,\r\n     Esq.), and had two daughters. Mr. West died in July, 1772.\r\n     His large and valuable collection of MANUSCRIPTS was sold to\r\n     the _Earl of Shelburne_, and is now deposited in the British\r\n     Museum.\"]\r\n\r\nLOREN. All hail to thee--transcendant bibliomaniac of other times!--of\r\ntimes, in which my father lived, and procured, at the sale of thy\r\nprecious book-treasures, not a few of those rare volumes which have so\r\nmuch gladdened the eyes of Lisardo.\r\n\r\nBELIN. I presume you mean, dear brother, some of those _black-looking_\r\ngentlemen, bound in fancifully marked coats of morocco, and _washed_\r\nand _ironed_ within (for you collectors must have recourse to a\r\nwoman's occupation) with so much care and nicety that even the eyes\r\nof our ancient Rebecca, with \"spectacle on nose\" to boot, could hardly\r\ndetect the cunning' conceit of your binder!\r\n\r\nLOREN. Spare my feelings and your own reputation, if you wish to\r\nappreciate justly the noble craft of book-repairing, &c.--But proceed,\r\ndear Lysander.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. You cannot have a greater affection towards the memory of the\r\ncollector of the _Bibliotheca Westiana_ than myself. Hark--! or is it\r\nonly a soft murmur from a congregation of autumnal zephyrs!--but\r\nmethought I heard a sound, as if calling upon us to look well to the\r\nfuture fate of our libraries--to look well to their being _creditably\r\ncatalogued_--\"For\" (and indeed it _is_ the voice of West's spirit that\r\nspeaks) \"my collection was barbarously murdered; and hence I am doomed\r\nto wander for a century, to give warning to the ----, ----, and ----,\r\nof the day, to execute this useful task with their own hands! Yes;\r\neven the name of PATERSON has not saved my collection from censure;\r\nbut his hands were then young and inexperienced--yet I suffer from\r\nthis innocent error!\" Away, away, vexed spirit--and let thy head rest\r\nin peace beneath the sod!\r\n\r\nALMAN. For heaven's sake, into what society are we introduced, sister?\r\nAll mad--book mad! but I hope harmless.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Allay your apprehensions; for, though we may have the\r\nenergies of the lion, we have the gentleness of the \"unweaned lamb.\"\r\nBut, in describing so many and such discordant characters, how can I\r\nproceed in the jog-trot way of--\"next comes such a one--and then\r\nfollows another--and afterwards proceeds a third, and now a fourth!?\"\r\n\r\nALMAN. Sir, you are right, and I solicit your forgiveness. If I have\r\nnot sufficient bookish enthusiasm to fall down and worship your\r\nCAXTONIAN DEITY, JAMES WEST, I am at least fully disposed to concede\r\nhim every excellent and amiable quality which sheds lustre upon a\r\nliterary character.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. All offence is expiated: for look, the spirit walks off\r\ncalmly--and seems to acknowledge, with satisfaction, such proper\r\nsentiments in the breast of one whose father and brother have been\r\nbenefited by his book treasures.\r\n\r\nThe rapturous, and, I fear you will think, the wild and incoherent,\r\nmanner in which I have noticed the sale of the _Bibliotheca Westiana_\r\nhad nearly driven from my recollection that, in the preceding, the\r\nsame, and subsequent, year, there was sold by auction a very curious\r\nand extraordinary collection of books and Prints belonging to honest\r\nTOM MARTIN,[389] _of Palgrave_, in Suffolk: a collector of whom, if I\r\nremember rightly, Herbert has, upon several occasions, spoken with a\r\nsort of veneration. If Lavater's system of physiognomy happen to\r\nreceive your approbation, you will conclude, upon contemplating Tom's\r\nfrank countenance--of which a cut precedes the title-page of the first\r\ncatalogue--that the collector of Palgrave must have been \"a fine old\r\nfellow.\" Martin's book-pursuits were miscellaneous, and perhaps a\r\nlittle too wildly followed up; yet some good fortune contributed to\r\nfurnish his collection with volumes of singular curiosity.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 389: \"Hereafter followeth\" rather a rough outline\r\n     of the contents of honest Tom Martin's miscellaneous and\r\n     curious collection. To the IVth part I have added a few\r\n     prices, and but a few. I respect too much the quiet and\r\n     comfort of the present race of bibliomaniacs, to inflame\r\n     their minds by a longer extract of such tantalizing sums\r\n     given for some of the most extraordinary volumes in English\r\n     Literature.----I. _A Catalogue of the Library of_ Mr. THOMAS\r\n     MARTIN, _of Palgrave, in Suffolk, lately deceased.

The commotions excited in the book world, by means of\r\nthe sales of the _Bibliotheca Westiana_ and _Martiniana_, had hardly\r\nceased, when a similar agitation took place from the dispersion of the\r\n_Monastic Library_ which once belonged to SERJEANT FLETEWODE;[390] a\r\nbibliomaniac who flourished in full vigour during the reign of\r\nElizabeth. The catalogue of these truly curious books is but a sorry\r\nperformance; but let the lover of rare articles put on his bathing\r\ncorks, and swim quietly across this ocean of black-letter, and he will\r\nbe abundantly repaid for the toil of such an aquatic excursion.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 390: The year following the sale of Mr. West's\r\n     books, a very curious and valuable collection, chiefly of\r\n     English literature, was disposed of by auction, by Paterson,\r\n     who published the catalogue under the following title:\r\n     \"BIBLIOTHECA MONASTICO-FLETEWODIANA.\" \"_A Catalogue of rare\r\n     books and tracts in various languages and faculties;\r\n     including the Ancient Conventual Library of Missenden Abbey,\r\n     in Buckinghamshire_; together with some choice remains of\r\n     that of the late eminent Serjeant at Law, WILLIAM FLETEWODE,\r\n     Esq., Recorder of London, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth;\r\n     among which are several specimens of the earliest\r\n     typography, foreign and English, including Caxton, Wynkyn de\r\n     Worde, Pynson, and others: a fine collection of English\r\n     history, some scarce old law books, a great number of old\r\n     English plays, several choice MSS. upon vellum, and other\r\n     subjects of literary curiosity. Also several of the best\r\n     editions of the classics, and modern English and French\r\n     books. Sold by auction by S. Paterson, December,\" 1774,\r\n     8vo., 3641 lots, or articles.

Of\r\n     _Antiquities_, _Chronicles_, and _Topography_, it would be\r\n     difficult to pitch upon the rarest volumes. The collection,\r\n     including very few MSS., contained probably about 7000\r\n     volumes. The catalogue, in a clean condition, is somewhat\r\n     uncommon.]\r\n\r\nYou will imagine that the BOOK-DISEASE now began to be more active and\r\nfatal than ever; for the ensuing year (namely, in 1775) died the\r\nfamous ANTHONY ASKEW, M.D. Those who recollect the zeal and\r\nscholarship of this illustrious bibliomaniac,[391] and the precious\r\nvolumes with which his library was stored, from the choice\r\ncollections of De Boze, Gaignat, Mead, and Folkes, cannot but sigh,\r\nwith grief of heart, on reflecting upon such a victim! How ardently,\r\nand how kindly (as I remember to have heard one of his intimate friend\r\n[Transcriber's Note: friends] say) would Askew unlock the stores of\r\nhis glittering book-treasures!--open the magnificent folio, or the\r\nshining duodecimo, _printed upon vellum_, and embossed with golden\r\nknobs, or held fast with silver clasps! How carefully would he unrol\r\nthe curious _manuscript_, decipher the half effaced characters--and\r\nthen, casting an eye of ecstacy over the shelves upon which similar\r\ntreasures were lodged, exult in the glorious prospect before him! But\r\ndeath--who, as Horace tells us, equally exercises the knocker of the\r\npalace and cottage-door, made no scruple to rap at that of our\r\nrenowned Doctor--when Askew, with all his skill in medicine and\r\nknowledge of books, yielded to the summons of the grim tyrant--and\r\ndied lamented, as he lived beloved!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 391: Lysander is now arrived, pursuing his\r\n     chronological order, at a very important period in the\r\n     annals of book-sales. The name and collection of Dr. ASKEW\r\n     are so well known in the bibliographical world that the\r\n     reader need not be detained with laboured commendations on\r\n     either: in the present place, however, it would be a cruel\r\n     disappointment not to say a word or two by way of preface or\r\n     prologue. Dr. ANTHONY ASKEW had eminently distinguished\r\n     himself by a refined taste, a sound knowledge, and an\r\n     indefatigable research, relating to every thing connected\r\n     with Grecian and Roman literature. It was to be expected,\r\n     even during his life, as he was possessed of sufficient\r\n     means to gratify himself with what was rare, curious, and\r\n     beautiful, in literature and the fine arts, that the public\r\n     would one day be benefited by such pursuits: especially as\r\n     he had expressed a wish that his treasures might be\r\n     unreservedly submitted to sale, after his decease. In this\r\n     wish the doctor was not singular. Many eminent collectors\r\n     had indulged it before him: and, to my knowledge, many\r\n     modern ones still indulge it. Accordingly, on the death of\r\n     Dr. Askew, in 1774, appeared, in the ensuing year, a\r\n     catalogue of his books for sale, by Messrs. Baker and Leigh,\r\n     under the following title: \"BIBLIOTHECA ASKEVIANA, _sive\r\n     Catalogus Librorum Rarissimorum Antonii Askew, M.D., quorum\r\n     Auctio fiet apud S. Baker et G. Leigh, in Vico dicto York\r\n     Street, Covent Garden, Londini, Die Lunæ, 13 Februarii_,\r\n     MDCCLXXV, _et in undeviginti sequentes dies_.\" A few copies\r\n     were struck off on _large paper_, which are yet rather\r\n     common. My own copy is of this kind, with the prices, and\r\n     names of the purchasers. We are told, by the compiler of the\r\n     catalogue, that it was thought \"unnecessary to say much with\r\n     respect to this library of the late Dr. Anthony Askew, as\r\n     the collector and the collection were so well known in\r\n     almost all parts of Europe.\" Afterwards it is observed that\r\n     \"The books in general are in very fine condition, many of\r\n     them bound in morocco, and russia leather, with gilt\r\n     leaves.\" \"To give a particular account,\" continues the\r\n     compiler, \"of the _many scarce editions_ of books in this\r\n     catalogue would be almost endless, therefore the _first\r\n     editions_ of the classics, and some _extremely rare books_,\r\n     are chiefly noticed. The catalogue, without any doubt,\r\n     contains the best, rarest, and most valuable collection of\r\n     GREEK and LATIN BOOKS that was ever sold in England, and the\r\n     great time and trouble of forming it will, it is hoped, be a\r\n     sufficient excuse for the price put to it.\" (1_s._ 6_d._ the\r\n     small paper, and 4_s._ the large.) This account is not\r\n     overcharged. The collection in regard to Greek and Roman\r\n     literature was _unique_ in its day. Enriched with many a\r\n     tome from the Harleian, Dr. Mead's, Martin Folkes's, and Dr.\r\n     Rawlinson's library, as well as with numerous rare and\r\n     splendid articles from foreign collections (for few men\r\n     travelled with greater ardour, or had an acuter\r\n     discrimination than Dr. Askew), the books were sought after\r\n     by almost every one then eminent for bibliographical\r\n     research. HIS MAJESTY was a purchaser, says Mr. J. Nichols,\r\n     to the amount of about 300_l._; Dr. Hunter, to the amount of\r\n     500_l._; and De Bure (who had commissions from the King of\r\n     France and many foreign collectors, to the amount of\r\n     1500_l._) made purchases to the same amount; Dr. Maty was\r\n     solicited by the trustees of the British Museum not to be\r\n     unmindful of _that repository_; and accordingly he became a\r\n     purchaser to a considerable amount. The late worthy and\r\n     learned Mr. M. CRACHERODE, whose library now forms one of\r\n     the most splendid acquisitions of the British Museum, and\r\n     whose _bequest_ of it will immortalize his memory, was also\r\n     among the \"Emptores literarii\" at this renowned sale. He had\r\n     enriched his collection with many an \"_Exemplar\r\n     Askevianum_;\" and, in his latter days, used to elevate his\r\n     hands and eyes, and exclaim against the prices _now_ offered\r\n     for EDITIONES PRINCIPES. The fact is, Dr. Askew's sale has\r\n     been considered a sort of _era_ in bibliography. Since that\r\n     period, rare and curious books in Greek and Latin literature\r\n     have been greedily sought after, and obtained (as a recent\r\n     sale abundantly testifies) at most extravagant prices. It is\r\n     very well for a veteran in bibliographical literature, as\r\n     was Mr. Cracherode, or as are Mr. Wodhull, and Dr.\r\n     Gosset--whose collections were, in part, formed in the days\r\n     of De Bure, Gaignat, Askew, Duke de la Valliere, and\r\n     Lamoignon--it is very well for such gentlemen to declaim\r\n     against _modern prices_! But what is to be done? Classical\r\n     books grow scarcer every day, and the love of literature,\r\n     and of possessing rare and interesting works, increases in\r\n     an equal ratio. Hungry bibliographers meet, at sales, with\r\n     well-furnished purses, and are resolved upon sumptuous fare!\r\n     Thus the hammer _vibrates_, after a bidding of FORTY POUNDS,\r\n     where formerly it used regularly to _fall_ at FOUR! But we\r\n     lose sight of Dr. Askew's _rare editions_, and _large paper\r\n     copies_. The following, gentle reader, is but an imperfect\r\n     specimen!\r\n\r\n     NO. 168.

See Schelhorn's \"_Amoenitates Literaræ\r\n     [Transcriber's Note: Literariæ]_,\" tom. ii., 430-iii., 144.\r\n     Dr. Hunter purchased Dr. Askew's copy, which I have seen in\r\n     the Museum of the former: the wood-cuts, 118 in number,\r\n     justify every thing said in commendation of them by Papillon\r\n     and Heinecken. Probably Dr. Askew purchased the above copy\r\n     of Osborne; for I find one in the _Bibl. Harleian_, vol.\r\n     iii., no. 3240. See, too, _Bibl.

It has been a moot point with bibliographers\r\n     whether the extraordinary type of this book be _wood_, and\r\n     cut in solid blocks, or moveable types of _metal_. No one is\r\n     better able to set this point \"at rest,\" as lawyers call it,\r\n     than the gentleman whose name is here last mentioned.\r\n\r\n     3337.

It was\r\n     purchased by Dr. Hunter, and is now in his Museum.\r\n     Originally it belonged to Dr. Taylor, the editor of Lysias\r\n     and Demosthenes, who originally procured it from the\r\n     Harleian Library, for _four_ guineas only. We are told that,\r\n     during his life, _one hundred_ guineas would not have\r\n     obtained it!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Rare and magnificent as the preceding articles may be\r\n     considered, I can confidently assure the reader that they\r\n     form a very small part of the extraordinary books in Dr.\r\n     ASKEW'S library. Many a _ten_ and _twenty pounder_ has been\r\n     omitted--many a _prince_ of an edition passed by unregarded!\r\n     The articles were 3570 in number; probably comprehending\r\n     about 7000 volumes. They were sold for 4000_l._ It remains\r\n     only to add that Dr. ASKEW was a native of Kendal, in\r\n     Westmorland; that he practised as a physician there with\r\n     considerable success, and, on his establishment in London,\r\n     was visited by all who were distinguished for learning, and\r\n     curious in the fine arts. Dr. Mead supported him with a sort\r\n     of paternal zeal; nor did he find in his _protegé_ an\r\n     ungrateful son. (See the Director, vol. i., p. 309.) Few\r\n     minds were probably more congenial than were those of MEAD\r\n     and ASKEW: the former had, if I may so speak, a magnificence\r\n     of sentiment which infused into the mind of the latter just\r\n     notions of a character aiming at _solid intellectual_ fame;\r\n     without the petty arts and dirty tricks which we now see too\r\n     frequently pursued to obtain it. Dr. ASKEW, with less\r\n     pecuniary means of gratifying it, evinced an equal ardour in\r\n     the pursuit of books, MSS., and inscriptions. I have heard\r\n     from a very worthy old gentleman, who used to revel 'midst\r\n     the luxury of ASKEW'S table, that few men exhibited their\r\n     books and pictures, or, as it is called, _shewed the Lions_,\r\n     better than did the Doctor. Of his attainments in Greek and\r\n     Roman literature it becomes not me to speak, when such a\r\n     scholar as Dr. PARR has been most eloquent in their praise.\r\n     I should observe that the MSS. of Dr. ASKEW were separately\r\n     sold in 1781, and produced a very considerable sum. The\r\n     Appendix to Scapula, published in an 8vo. volume, in 1789,\r\n     was compiied [Transcriber's Note: compiled] from one of\r\n     these MSS.]\r\n\r\nAfter an event so striking and so melancholy, one would think that\r\nfuture _Virtuosi_ would have barricadoed their doors, and fumigated\r\ntheir chambers, in order to escape the ravages of the _Book-Pest_:--but\r\nhow few are they who profit by experience, even when dearly obtained!\r\nThe subsequent HISTORY OF THE BIBLIOMANIA is a striking proof of the\r\ntruth of this remark: for the disease rather increased, and the work\r\nof death yet went on. In the following year (1776) died JOHN\r\nRATCLIFFE;[392] a bibliomaniac of a very peculiar character. If he\r\nhad contented himself with his former occupation, and frequented the\r\nbutter and cheese, instead of the book, market--if he could have\r\nfancied himself in a brown peruke, and Russian apron, instead of an\r\nembroidered waistcoat, velvet breeches, and flowing periwig, he might,\r\nperhaps, have enjoyed greater longevity; but, infatuated by the\r\n_Caxtons_ and _Wynkyn de Wordes_ of the West and Fletewode\r\ncollections, he fell into the snare; and the more he struggled to\r\ndisentangle himself, the more certainly did he become a victim to the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 392: BIBLIOTHECA RATCLIFFIANA; or, \"_A Catalogue\r\n     of the elegant and truly valuable Library of_ JOHN\r\n     RATCLIFFE, _Esq., late of Bermondsey, deceased_. The whole\r\n     collected with great judgment and expense, during the last\r\n     thirty years of his life: comprehending a large and most\r\n     choice collection of the rare old English _black-letter_, in\r\n     fine preservation, and in elegant bindings, printed by\r\n     Caxton, Lettou, Machlinia, the anonymous St. Alban's\r\n     Schoolmaster, Wynkyn de Worde, Pynson, Berthelet, Grafton,\r\n     Day, Newberie, Marshe, Jugge, Whytchurch, Wyer, Rastell,\r\n     Coplande, and the rest of the _Old English Typographers_:\r\n     several missals and MSS., and two pedigrees on vellum,\r\n     finely illuminated.\" The title-page then sets forth a\r\n     specimen of these black-letter gems; among which our eyes\r\n     are dazzled with a galaxy of Caxtons, Wynkyn de Wordes,\r\n     Pynsons, &c., &c. The sale took place on March 27, 1776;\r\n     although the _year_ is unaccountably omitted by that\r\n     renowned auctioneer, the late Mr. Christie, who disposed of\r\n     them. If ever there was a _unique_ collection, this was\r\n     one--the very essence of Old Divinity, Poetry, Romances, and\r\n     Chronicles! The articles were only 1675 in number; but their\r\n     intrinsic value amply compensated for their paucity. The\r\n     following is but an inadequate specimen:\r\n\r\n     NO. 1315. Horace's Arte of Poetrie, Pistles, and Satyres, by\r\n     Durant, 1567. _First English. Edition_ £0 16_s._ 0_d._\r\n\r\n     1321. The Shepard's Calendar, 1579.

Catalogue of the _rare old\r\n     black-letter and other curious and uncommon books_, 4 vols.\r\n     7 15 0\r\n\r\n     [This would have been the most delicious article to _my_\r\n     palate. If the present owner of it were disposed to part\r\n     with it, I could not find it in my heart to refuse him\r\n     _compound interest_ for his money. As is the wooden\r\n     frame-work to the bricklayer, in the construction of his\r\n     arch, so might Mr. Ratcliffe's MS. Catalogues be to me in\r\n     the compilation of a certain _magnum opus_!]\r\n\r\n     I beg pardon of the _manes_ of \"John Ratcliffe, Esq.,\" for\r\n     the very inadequate manner in which I have brought forward\r\n     his collection to public notice. The memory of such a man\r\n     ought to be dear to the \"_black-letter-dogs_\" of the present\r\n     day: for he had (mirabile dictu!) _upwards of_ THIRTY\r\n     CAXTONS! I take the present opportunity of presenting the\r\n     reader with the following engraving of the Ratcliffe\r\n     Library, Oxon.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration]\r\n\r\n     If I might hazard a comparison between Mr. James West's and\r\n     Mr. John Ratcliffe's collections, I should say that the\r\n     former was more extensive; the latter more curious. Mr.\r\n     West's, like a magnificent _champagne_, executed by the hand\r\n     of Claude or Both, and enclosing mountains, meadows, and\r\n     streams, presented to the eye of the beholder a scene at\r\n     once luxuriant and fruitful: Mr. Ratcliffe's, like one of\r\n     those confined pieces of scenery, touched by the pencil of\r\n     Rysdael or Hobbima, exhibited to the beholder's eye a spot\r\n     equally interesting, but less varied and extensive: the\r\n     judgment displayed in both might be the same. The sweeping\r\n     foliage and rich pasture of the former could not, perhaps,\r\n     afford greater gratification than the thatched cottage,\r\n     abrupt declivities, and gushing streams of the latter. To\r\n     change the metaphor--Mr. West's was a magnificent\r\n     repository; Mr. Ratcliffe's, a cabinet of curiosities. Of\r\n     some particulars of Mr. Ratcliffe's life, I had hoped to\r\n     have found gleanings in Mr. Nichols's _Anecdotes of Bowyer_;\r\n     but his name does not even appear in the index; being\r\n     probably reserved for the second forth-coming enlarged\r\n     edition. Meanwhile, it may not be uninteresting to remark\r\n     that, like Magliabechi, (vide p. 86, ante) he imbibed his\r\n     love of reading and collecting from the accidental\r\n     possession of scraps and leaves of books. The fact is, Mr.\r\n     Ratcliffe once kept a _chandler's shop_ in the Borough; and,\r\n     as is the case with all retail traders, had great quantities\r\n     of old books brought to him to be purchased at so much _per\r\n     lb._! Hence arose his passion for collecting the\r\n     _black-letter_, as well as _Stilton cheeses_: and hence, by\r\n     unwearied assiduity, and attention to business, he amassed a\r\n     sufficiency to retire, and live, for the remainder of his\r\n     days, upon the luxury of OLD ENGLISH LITERATURE!]\r\n\r\nIt is with pain that I trace the ravages of the BOOK-MANIA to a later\r\nperiod. Many a heart yet aches, and many a tear is yet shed, on a\r\nremembrance of the mortality of this frightful disease. After the\r\npurchasers of Ratcliffe's treasures had fully perused, and deposited\r\nin fit places within their libraries, some of the scarcest volumes in\r\nthe collection, they were called upon to witness a yet more splendid\r\nvictim to the Bibliomania: I mean, the Honourable TOPHAM\r\nBEAUCLERK.[393] One, who had frequently gladdened JOHNSON in his\r\ngloomy moments; and who is allowed, by that splenetic sage and great\r\nteacher of morality, to have united the elegant manners of a gentleman\r\nwith the mental accomplishments of a scholar. Beauclerk's Catalogue is\r\na fair specimen of the analytico-bibliographical powers of Paterson:\r\nyet it must be confessed that this renowned champion of\r\ncatalogue-makers shines with greater, and nearly perfect, splendour,\r\nin the collection of the REV. THOMAS CROFTS[394]--a collection which,\r\ntaking it \"for all in all,\" I know not whether it be exceeded by any\r\nwhich this country has recorded in the shape of a private catalogue.\r\nThe owner was a modest, careful, and acutely sagacious bibliomaniac:\r\nlearned, retired, yet communicative: and if ever you lay hold of a\r\n_large paper_ copy of a catalogue of his books, which, as well as the\r\nsmall, carries the printed prices at the end, seize it in triumph,\r\nLisardo, for it is a noble volume, and by no means a worthless prize.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 393: There are few libraries better worth the\r\n     attention of a scholarlike collector than was the one of the\r\n     distinguished character above noticed by Lysander. The\r\n     Catalogue of Beauclerk's books has the following title:\r\n     \"_Bibliotheca Beauclerkiana; A Catalogue of the large and\r\n     valuable Library of the late Honourable_ TOPHAM BEAUCLERK,\r\n     F.R.S., _deceased_; comprehending an excellent choice of\r\n     books, to the number of upwards of 30,000 volumes, &c. Sold\r\n     by auction, by Mr. Paterson, in April, 1781,\" 8vo. The\r\n     catalogue has two parts: part I. containing 230; part _ii._\r\n     137, pp. The most magnificent and costly volume was the\r\n     largest paper copy of Dr. Clarke's edition of Cæsar's\r\n     Commentaries, 1712, fol., which was sold for 44_l._; and of\r\n     which the binding, according to Dr. Harwood's testimony,\r\n     cost 5_l._ 5_s._ There is nothing, in _modern_ times, very\r\n     marvellous in this price of binding. Of the _two parts_ of\r\n     the Beauclerk collection, the _second_ is the most valuable\r\n     to the collector of English Antiquities and History, and the\r\n     _first_ to the general scholar. But let not the bibliomaniac\r\n     run too swiftly over the first, for at nos. 3450, 3453, he\r\n     will find two books which rank among the rarest of those in\r\n     old English poetry. At the close of the second part, there\r\n     are a few curious manuscripts; three of which are deserving\r\n     of a description here.\r\n\r\n     PART II.\r\n\r\n     3275. Thomas of Arundel, his Legend in old English verse;\r\n     VII parts, with the Entre, or Prologue: _written A.D.\r\n     M.C.VII. upon vellum, the Capitals illuminated_, fol. Here\r\n     follows a specimen of the verse £1 18_s._ 0_d._\r\n\r\n          _ye fyrst pt of ys yt es\r\n          of mon and of his urechednes._\r\n\r\n          _ye secounde pte folowyng es\r\n          of ye worldes unstabillnes._\r\n\r\n          _ye yyrdde pt yt is of deth\r\n          & of peyn yt wt hy geth._\r\n\r\n          _the ferthe parte is of purgatorye\r\n          yere soules ben clensed of her folye._\r\n\r\n          _ye fyfte pt of ys dey of doom\r\n          & of tokens yt byfore shul coom._\r\n\r\n          _ye syxte pt of ys boke to telle\r\n          yt speketh of ye peynes of helle._\r\n\r\n          _ye seventhe part of joys in heven\r\n          yat bene more yenne tong may neuen._\r\n\r\n     3276. The Life and Acts of St. Edmond, King and Martyr, by\r\n     John Lydgate, Monk of Bury, fol.: _a choice MS. upon vellum,\r\n     illuminated throughout, and embellished with 52 Historical\r\n     Miniatures_. For a specimen of the verse, take the first\r\n     stanza: 22 1 0\r\n\r\n          _The noble stoory to putte in remembraunce\r\n          Of Seynt Edmond mayd martre and kyng\r\n          With his suppoor: my style i wyl avaunce\r\n          ffirst to compyle afftre my konnyng\r\n          his gloryous lyff his birthe and his gynnying\r\n          And by discent how he was soo good\r\n          Was in Saxonye borne of the royal blood._\r\n\r\n     3288.

Together with a genealogical deduction of\r\n     this noble family from the blood of 12 forreyne princes:\r\n     viz. 3 Emperours, 3 Kings, 3 Dukes, and 3 Earles, &c.\r\n     _Gathered out of History, Recordes, and other Monuments of\r\n     Antiquity, by Percivall Goulding, Gent. The Arms\r\n     illuminated, folio._ 9 0 0\r\n\r\n     I will just add that this catalogue is creditably printed in\r\n     a good size octavo volume, and that there are copies upon\r\n     _large paper_. The arrangement of the books is very\r\n     creditable to the bibliographical reputation of Paterson.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 394: When the reader is informed that Paterson\r\n     tells us, in the preface of this volume, that \"In almost\r\n     every language and science, and even under the shortest\r\n     heads, some one or more rare articles occur; but in the\r\n     copious classes, such as follow, literary curiosity is\r\n     gratified, is _highly feasted_\"--and that the author of this\r\n     remark used, in his latter days, to hit his knee hard with\r\n     his open hand, and exclaim--\"By G----, Crofts' Catalogue is\r\n     my chef d'oeuvre, out and out\"--when he reflects, I say,\r\n     for a minute upon these two bibliographical stimuli, he will\r\n     hasten (if he have it not already) to seize upon that volume\r\n     of which the following is but an imperfect specimen of the\r\n     treasures contained in it: \"_Bibliotheca Croftsiana: A\r\n     Catalogue of the curious and distinguished Library of the\r\n     late Reverend and Learned_ THOMAS CROFTS, A.M., &c.

This\r\n     collection, containing 8360 articles, although not quite so\r\n     generally useful as the preceding, is admirably well\r\n     arranged; and evinces, from the rarity of some of the\r\n     volumes in the more curious departments of literature, the\r\n     sound bibliographical knowledge and correct taste of Mr.\r\n     Crofts: who was, in truth, both a scholar and bibliomaniac\r\n     of no ordinary reputation.

What can there possibly be in a large paper copy of a\r\n_Catalogue of Books_ which merits the appellation of \"nobleness\" and\r\n\"richness?\"\r\n\r\nLOREN. You are a little out of order. Such a question cuts the heart\r\nof a bibliographer in twain. Pray let Lysander pursue his narrative.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. I have no sort of objection to such interruptions. But I think\r\nthe day is not very far distant when females will begin to have as\r\nhigh a relish for _large paper_ copies of every work as their male\r\nrivals. Now let us go on quietly towards the close of my long-winded\r\nbibliomaniacal history. And first let us not fail to pay due respect\r\nto the cabinet of literary bijoux collected by that renowned\r\nbibliomaniac, MARK CEPHAS TUTET.[395] His collection was distinguished\r\nby some very uncommon articles of early date, both of foreign and\r\nBritish typography; and, if you take a peep into Lorenzo's priced copy\r\nof the catalogue containing also the purchasers' names, you will find\r\nthat most notorious modern bibliomaniacs ran away with the choicest\r\nprizes. Tutet's catalogue, although drawn up in a meagre and most\r\ndisadvantageous style, is a great favourite with me; chiefly for the\r\nvaluable articles which it exhibits.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 395: _A Catalogue of the genuine and valuable\r\n     Collection of printed Books and Manuscripts of the late_\r\n     MARK CEPHAS TUTET, Esq., to be sold by auction by Mr.\r\n     Gerard, on Wednesday, the 15th of February, 1786, 8vo. This\r\n     library evinces the select taste and accurate judgment of\r\n     its collector. There were only 513 articles, or lots; but\r\n     these in general were both curious and valuable.

To this catalogue of 8001 articles, there is a\r\n     short (I wish I could add \"sweet\") preface, which has been\r\n     extracted in the _Gentleman's Magazine_, vol. lvi., p. 334;\r\n     and in the _Censura Literaria_, vol. ii., p. 252--but,\r\n     whatever accidental reputation the volume may have received\r\n     from the notice of it in these periodical works, I deem both\r\n     the preface and the work itself quite unworthy of Paterson's\r\n     credit. There is an alphabetical index (not always very\r\n     correct); and a few bibliographical notes are subjoined to\r\n     the specification of the titles; and these considerations\r\n     alone will give the book a place in the library of the\r\n     bibliomaniac. The collection is, in fact, neither universal\r\n     nor select: and the preface is written in the worst of all\r\n     styles, containing the most commonplace observations.]\r\n\r\nThe following year, was sold, in a similar way, the select and very\r\ncurious collection of RICHARD WRIGHT, M.D.;[396] the strength of which\r\nlay chiefly in publications relating to the _Drama_ and _Romances_.\r\nIt is, in my humble opinion, a most judicious, as well as neatly\r\nprinted, little catalogue; and not more than a dozen copies of it, I\r\nthink, were printed upon _large paper_. Secure this volume, Lisardo,\r\nif you wish to add to your riches in English bibliography.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 396: Lysander has not drawn too strong an outline\r\n     in his picture of the _Bibliotheca Wrightiana_. The\r\n     collection was elegant and select. Let us say a little more\r\n     about it. \"_A Catalogue of the Library of_ RICHARD WRIGHT,\r\n     M.D. &c., consisting of an elegant and extensive collection\r\n     of books in every branch of learning, &c., many of the\r\n     scarcest editions of the Old English Poets, Novels, and\r\n     Romances; also a most singular assemblage of Theatrical\r\n     Writers, including the rarest productions of the English\r\n     Drama.\" Sold by auction by T. and J. Egerton, April 23rd,\r\n     1787, 8vo. The volume is neatly printed, and the books in\r\n     the collection are arranged in alphabetical order under\r\n     their respective departments. We will now fill up a little\r\n     of the aforementioned strong outline of the picture of\r\n     Wright's library: which contained 2824 articles.\r\n\r\n     917, 920, 921-4-5-6-7, 931-2-3, exhibit a glorious specimen\r\n     of the ancient English Chronicles--which, collectively, did\r\n     not produce a sum above £45 0_s._ 0_d._\r\n\r\n     1223.

Therefore, \"STAT NOMINIS\r\n     UMBRA:\" viz. ----!]\r\n\r\nLOREN. Was Wright's the only collection disposed of at this period,\r\nwhich was distinguished for its dramatic treasures? I think\r\nHENDERSON'S[397] library was sold about this time?\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 397: _A Catalogue of the Library of_ JOHN\r\n     HENDERSON, Esq. (late of Covent Garden Theatre), &c. Sold by\r\n     auction by T. and J. Egerton, on February, 1786, 8vo. Do not\r\n     let the lover of curious books in general imagine that\r\n     Henderson's collection was entirely dramatical. A glance at\r\n     the contents of page 12 to page 22, inclusively, will shew\r\n     that this library contained some very first-rate rarities.\r\n     When the dramatic collector enters upon page 23, (to the end\r\n     of the volume, p. 71) I will allow him to indulge in all the\r\n     _mania_ of this department of literature, \"withouten ony\r\n     grudgynge.\" He may also ring as many _peals_ as it pleaseth\r\n     him, upon discovering that he possesses all the copies of a\r\n     dramatic author, ycleped _George Peele_, that are notified\r\n     at nos. 923-4! Henderson's library was, without doubt, an\r\n     extraordinary one. As we are upon _Dramatic Libraries_, let\r\n     us, for fear Lysander should forget it, notice the\r\n     following, though a little out of chronological order. \"_A\r\n     Catalogue, &c., of the late_ Mr. JAMES WILLIAM DODD, of the\r\n     _Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, &c. Sold by auction by Leigh and\r\n     Sotheby_, Jan. 19, 1797, 8vo., 2435 lots.\" There was more of\r\n     the _Drama_ in this than in Henderson's collection. Mr.\r\n     Kemble purchased the dearest volume, which was \"Whetstone's\r\n     Promos and Cassandra,\" 1578, 4to. (no. 2396) for 7_l._\r\n     10_s._ Mr. George Nicol (for the late Duke of Roxburgh) kept\r\n     up a tremendous fire at this sale! Akin to Dodd's, was the\r\n     \"_Curious and Valuable Library of_ GEORGE SMYTH, Esq.--sold\r\n     by Leigh and Sotheby, June 2, 1797, 8vo.\" There were many\r\n     uncommon books in this collection, exclusively of those\r\n     appertaining to the Drama; and when I mention, in this\r\n     latter department--Hughes's Misfortunes of Prince Arthur,\r\n     &c., printed by Robinson, 1587, 4to. (no. 1376; 16_l._\r\n     15_s._), both the parts of Shakespeare's Henry the Fourth\r\n     (1599-1600, 4to., nos. 1436-7; 18_l._ 18_s._), his Much\r\n     Ado about Nothing, 1600, 4to., (no. 1438; 7_l._\r\n     10_s._)--I say enough to sharpen the collector's appetite to\r\n     obtain, if he have it not, possession of this curious but\r\n     barbarously printed catalogue. To these, let me add the\r\n     \"_Catalogue of a portion of the Library of_ WILLIAM\r\n     FILLINGHAM, Esq., _consisting of old quarto plays, early\r\n     English Poetry, and a few scarce Tracts, &c., sold by Leigh\r\n     and Sotheby_, April 1805, 8vo.\" The arrangement of this\r\n     small catalogue is excellent. Many of the books in it are of\r\n     the rarest occurrence; and, to my knowledge, were in the\r\n     finest preservation. The collector is no more! He died in\r\n     India; cut off in the prime of life, and in the midst of his\r\n     intellectual and book-collecting ardour! He was a man of\r\n     exceedingly gentlemanlike manners, and amiable disposition;\r\n     and his taste was, upon the whole, well cultivated and\r\n     correct. Many a pleasant, and many a profitable, hour have I\r\n     spent in his \"delightsome\" library!!!]\r\n\r\nLYSAND. It was; and if you had not reminded me of it, I should have\r\nentirely forgotten it. Catalogues of _dramatic Libraries_, well\r\narranged, are of great service to the cause of the Bibliomania.\r\n\r\nLIS. I wish we could procure some act of parliament to induce the\r\ndramatic collectors--by a fair remuneration--to give a well analysed\r\naccount of their libraries. We should then have the _Bibliotheca\r\nRoxburghiana_, _Bibliotheca Maloniana_, and what say you to the\r\n_Bibliotheca Kemblëiana_.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. You are running wild. Let me continue my bibliomaniacal\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nWe may now advance directly to the exquisite--and shall I say,\r\nunparalleled?--library of MAJOR PEARSON![398] a gentleman, who has\r\nfar eclipsed the bibliomaniacal reputation of his military\r\npredecessor, General Dormer. This extraordinary collection was sold\r\nby auction the very next year ensuing the sale of Dr. Wright's books\r\nand so thickly and richly is it sprinkled with the black-letter, and\r\nother curious lore--so varied, interesting, and valuable, are the\r\ndepartments into which it is divided--that it is no wonder his present\r\nMajesty, the late Duke of Roxburgh, and George Steevens, were earnest\r\nin securing some of the choicest gems contained in the same. Such a\r\ncollection, sold at the present day--when there is such a \"_qui vive_\"\r\nfor the sort of literature which it displays--what would it produce?\r\nAt least four times more, than its sum total, two and twenty years\r\nago!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 398: If the reader attend only to the above\r\n     flourishing eulogy, by Lysander, upon the extraordinary\r\n     collection of Major, or Thomas, Pearson, I fear he will not\r\n     rise from the perusal of these pages impressed with very\r\n     accurate notions of the same. To qualify such ardent\r\n     panegyric, and at the same time to please the hearts of all\r\n     honest bibliomaniacs, I here subjoin something like a sober\r\n     analysis of the _Bibliotheca Pearsoniana_. The title to the\r\n     Sale Catalogue is as follows: \"_Biblioth. Pearson. A\r\n     Catalogue of the Library of_ THOMAS PEARSON, Esq.\r\n     _Containing a very extensive Collection of the best and\r\n     rarest books in every branch of English Literature, &c. Sold\r\n     by Auction by T. and J. Egerton, in April, 1788_,\" 8vo. Like\r\n     all the sale catalogues put forth by the Egertons, the\r\n     present is both judiciously arranged and neatly printed. It\r\n     is said that there are only twelve copies upon _large\r\n     paper_; but I doubt the smallness of this number. My own is\r\n     of this kind, superbly bound, and priced with a neatness\r\n     peculiar to the calligraphical powers of the 'forementioned\r\n     friend. It may not be amiss to prefix an extract from a\r\n     newspaper of the day; in which this sale was thus noticed:\r\n     \"The Black-lettero-mania, which raged so furiously in the\r\n     course of last Spring at the Sale of Dr. WRIGHT'S Books, has\r\n     broken out with still greater violence at the present\r\n     auction of MAJOR PEARSON'S Library. This assertion may be\r\n     countenanced by the following examples.\" Then follow a few\r\n     specimens of the prices given. The reader is now presented\r\n     with copious specimens, selected according to their\r\n     numerical order: the addenda, between inverted commas, being\r\n     copied from the said newspaper.\r\n\r\n     1888.

Egerton. I have to add that the late DUKE\r\n     OF ROXBURGH became the purchaser of these \"matchless\"\r\n     volumes. Whilst in Major Pearson's possession, \"with the\r\n     assistance of Mr. Reed, the collection received very great\r\n     additions, and was bound in two very large volumes; in this\r\n     state (says Mr. Nicol,) it was bought by the Duke of\r\n     Roxburghe. After the industrious exertions of two such\r\n     skilful collectors as Major Pearson and Mr. Reed, the Duke\r\n     did not flatter himself with ever being able to add much to\r\n     the collection; but, as usual, he undervalued his own\r\n     industry. Finding that his success far exceeded his\r\n     expectations, he determined to add a _third volume_ to the\r\n     collection. Among these new acquisitions are some very rare\r\n     ballads; one quoted by Hamlet, of which no other copy is\r\n     known to exist.\" _Preface to the Roxburgh Catalogue_, p. 5.\r\n     The ballad here alluded to may be seen in Mr. Evans's recent\r\n     edition of his father's _Collection of Old Ballads_; vol.\r\n     i., p. 7.\r\n\r\n     3262 to 3329.

Madness!--Madness inconceivable!--and undescribed by Darwin,\r\nArnold, and Haslam! But, I pray you, proceed.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Alas, madam, the task grows more and more complex as I draw\r\ntowards the completion of it.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1789 the book-treasures of the far-famed PINELLI[399]\r\nCollection were disposed of by public auction: nor can one think,\r\nwithout some little grief of heart, upon the dispersion of a library,\r\nwhich (much more than commercial speculations and profits) had, for\r\nupwards of a century, reflected so much credit upon the family of its\r\npossessors. The atmosphere of our metropolis, about this period,\r\nbecame as much infected with the miasmata of the BOOK-PLAGUE as it\r\ndid, about 130 years before, with the miasmata of a plague of a\r\ndifferent description: for the worthy inhabitants of Westminster had\r\nhardly recovered from the shock of the bibliomaniacal attack from the\r\nPinelli sale, 'ere they were doomed to suffer the tortures of a\r\nsimilar one in that of the PARIS[400] collection. This latter was of\r\nshorter duration; but of an infinitely more powerful nature: for then\r\nyou might have seen the most notorious bibliomaniacs, with blood\r\ninflamed and fancies intoxicated, rushing towards the examination of\r\nthe truly matchless volumes contained within this collection. Yet\r\nremember that, while the whole of Pall Mall was thronged with the\r\ncarriages of collectors, anxious to carry off in triumph some _vellum\r\ncopy_ of foreign execution--there was sold, in a quiet corner of the\r\nmetropolis, the copious and scholar-like collection of MICHAEL LORT,\r\nD.D. The owner of this latter library was a learned and amiable\r\ncharacter, and a bibliographer of no mean repute.[401] His books were\r\nfrequently enriched with apposite MS. remarks; and the variety and\r\nextent of his collection, suited to all tastes, and sufficiently\r\nabundant for every appetite, forms, I think, a useful model after\r\nwhich future bibliomaniacs may build their libraries.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 399: Mention has already been made of the\r\n     different _Catalogues of the_ PINELLI _Collection_: see p.\r\n     21, ante. Here, as Lysander has thought proper again to\r\n     notice the name of the collector, I am tempted to add a few\r\n     specimens of the extraordinary books contained in his\r\n     extraordinary library: adding thereto the prices for which\r\n     they were sold. But--again and again I observe, _in\r\n     limine_--these sums form no criterion of the _present_ worth\r\n     of the books; be the same more or less!

I am glad to hear you notice such kind of collections; for\r\nutility and common sense have always appeared to me a great\r\ndesideratum among the libraries of your professed bibliomaniacs.\r\n\r\nBELIN. Yes:--You pride yourselves upon your large paper, and clean,\r\nand matchless copies--but you do not dwell quite so satisfactorily\r\nupon your useful and profitable volumes--which, surely stand not in\r\nneed of expensive embellishments. Lort's collection would be the\r\nlibrary for my money--if I were disposed to become a female\r\nbibliomaniac!\r\n\r\nLIS.

My father attended the\r\nsale; and purchased at it a great number of the _Old English\r\nChronicles_, and volumes relating to _English History_, which Lisardo\r\nso much admired in the library.

Whether they have such\r\n     desperate bibliomaniacs in Scotland, as we possess in\r\n     London, and especially of the book-auction species--is a\r\n     point which I cannot take upon me to decide. Certain it is\r\n     that the notes of their great poet are not deficient in\r\n     numerous tempting extracts from rare black-letter tomes; and\r\n     if his example be not more generally followed than it is,\r\n     the fault must lie with some scribe or other who counteracts\r\n     its influence by propagating opinions, and recommending\r\n     studies, of a different, and less tasteful, cast of\r\n     character.

This collection\r\nwas an exceedingly valuable one; rather select than extensive:\r\nexhibiting, in pretty nearly an equal degree, some of the rarest\r\nbooks in Greek, Latin, and English literature. The _keimelion_ of the\r\nMasonian cabinet, in the estimation of the black-letter bibliomaniacs,\r\nwas a perfect copy of the _St. Albans' edition_ of Juliana Barnes's\r\nbook of _Hawking, Hunting_, and _Angling_; which perfect copy is now\r\nreposing in a collection where there are _keimelia_ of far greater\r\nvalue to dim its wonted lustre. But let Mason have our admiration and\r\nesteem. His library was elegant, judicious, and, in many respects,\r\nvery precious: and the collector of such volumes was a man of worth\r\nand learning.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 406: \"_Museum Southgatianum; being a Catalogue of\r\n     the valuable Collection of Books, Coins, Medals, and Natural\r\n     History of the late Rev._ RICHARD SOUTHGATE, A.B., F.A.S.,\r\n     &c. To which are prefixed Memoirs of his Life. London:\r\n     printed for Leigh and Sotheby,\" &c. 1795, 8vo. The books were\r\n     comprised in 2593 lots. The coins and medals extend, in the\r\n     catalogue, to 68 pages. The shells and natural curiosities\r\n     (sold in May, 1795) to 11 pages. This catalogue possesses,\r\n     what every similar one should possess, a compendious and\r\n     perspicuous account of the collector. My copy of it is upon\r\n     _large paper_; but the typographical execution is\r\n     sufficiently defective.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 407: Lysander is right in noticing \"_all the\r\n     parts_\" of the Masonian Library.

Thy name will\r\nlive long among scholars in general; and in the bosoms of virtuous and\r\nlearned bibliomaniacs thy memory shall ever be enshrined! The walls of\r\nEmanuel College now cease to convey the sounds of thy festive\r\nwit--thy volumes are no longer seen, like Richard Smith's \"bundles of\r\nsticht books,\" strewn upon the floor; and thou hast ceased, in the\r\ncause of thy beloved Shakspeare, to delve into the fruitful ore of\r\nblack-letter literature. Peace to thy honest spirit; for thou wert\r\nwise without vanity, learned without pedantry, and joyous without\r\nvulgarity!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 408: There is but a scanty memorial of this\r\n     extraordinary and ever respectable bibliomaniac, in the\r\n     _Gentleman's Magazine_; vol. lxvii. pt. ii. p. 805: 888: nor\r\n     is it noticed, among Farmer's theologico-literary labours,\r\n     that he was author of an ingenious essay upon the\r\n     _Demoniacs_ mentioned in scripture; in which essay he took\r\n     up the idea of Mede, that these Demoniacs were _madmen_. Dr.\r\n     Farmer's essay upon the _Learning of Shakespeare_ is, in\r\n     respect to the materials, arguments, and conclusions--what\r\n     the late Bishop of Salisbury's [Douglas] was upon\r\n     _Miracles_--original, powerful, and incontrovertible. Never\r\n     was there an octavo volume, like Farmer's upon\r\n     Shakespeare--which embraced so many, and such curious,\r\n     points, and which displayed such research, ingenuity, and\r\n     acuteness--put forth with so little pomp, parade, or\r\n     pedantry. Its popularity was remarkable; for it delighted\r\n     both the superficial and deeply-versed reader in\r\n     black-letter lore. Dr. Parr's well applied Ciceronian\r\n     phrase, in lauding the \"ingenious and joy-inspiring\r\n     language\" of Farmer, gives us some notion of the colloquial\r\n     powers of this acute bibliomaniac; whose books were\r\n     generally scattered upon the floor, as Lysander above\r\n     observes, like old Richard Smith's \"stitched bundles.\"\r\n     Farmer had his foragers; his jackalls: and his\r\n     avant-couriers: for it was well known how dearly he loved\r\n     every thing that was interesting and rare in the literature\r\n     of former ages. As he walked the streets of London--careless\r\n     of his dress--and whether his wig was full-bottomed or\r\n     narrow-bottomed--he would talk and \"mutter strange speeches\"\r\n     to himself; thinking all the time, I ween, of some curious\r\n     discovery he had recently made in the aforesaid precious\r\n     black-letter tomes. But the reader is impatient for the\r\n     _Bibliotheca Farmeriana_: the title to the catalogue whereof\r\n     is as follows. \"_Bibl. Farm.

It is in\r\n     vain to look forward for the day when book-gems, similar to\r\n     those which have just been imperfectly described from the\r\n     _Bibl. Farmeriana_, will be disposed of at similar prices.\r\n     The young collector may indulge an ardent hope; but, if\r\n     there be any thing of the spirit of prophecy in my humble\r\n     predictions, that hope will never be realised. Dr. Farmer's\r\n     copies were, in general, in sorry condition; the possessor\r\n     caring little (like Dr. Francis Bernard; vide p. 316, ante)\r\n     for large margins and splendid binding. His own name,\r\n     generally accompanied with a bibliographical remark, and\r\n     both written in a sprawling character, usually preceded the\r\n     title-page. The science (dare I venture upon so magnificent\r\n     a word?) of bibliography was, even in Farmer's latter time,\r\n     but jejune, and of limited extent: and this will account for\r\n     some of the common-place bibliographical memoranda of the\r\n     owner of these volumes. We may just add that there are some\r\n     few copies of this catalogue printed on _large paper_, on\r\n     paper of a better quality than the small; which latter is\r\n     sufficiently wretched. I possess a copy of the former kind,\r\n     with the _prices_ and _purchasers' names_ affixed--and\r\n     moreover, _uncut_!]\r\n\r\nA poor eulogy, this, upon Farmer!--but my oratory begins to wax faint.\r\nFor this reason I cannot speak with justice of the friend and\r\nfellow-critic of Farmer--GEORGE STEEVENS[409]--of Shakspearian renown!\r\nThe Library of this extraordinary critic and collector was sold by\r\nauction in the year 1800; and, being formed rather after the model of\r\nMason's, than of Farmer's, it was rich to an excess in choice and rare\r\npieces. Nor is it an uninteresting occupation to observe, in looking\r\namong the prices, the enormous sums which were given for some volumes\r\nthat cost Steevens not a twentieth part of their produce:--but which,\r\ncomparatively with their present worth, would bring considerably\r\nhigher prices! What arduous contention, \"_Renardine shifts_,\" and bold\r\nbidding; what triumph on the one part, and vexation on the other,\r\nwere exhibited at the book-sale!--while the auctioneer, like Jove\r\nlooking calmly down upon the storm which he himself had raised, kept\r\nhis even temper; and \"ever and anon\" dealt out a gracious smile\r\namidst all the turbulence that surrounded him! Memorable æra!--the\r\nveteran collector grows young again in thinking upon the valour he\r\nthen exhibited; and the juvenile collector talks \"braggartly\" of other\r\ntimes--which he calls the golden days of the bibliomania--when he\r\nreflects upon his lusty efforts in securing an _Exemplar\r\nSteevensianum_!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 409: If Lysander's efforts begin to relax--what\r\n     must be the debilitated mental state of the poor annotator,\r\n     who has accompanied the book-orator thus long and thus\r\n     laboriously? Can STEEVENS receive justice at _my_\r\n     hands--when my friends, aided by hot madeira, and beauty's\r\n     animating glances, acknowledge their exhausted state of\r\n     intellect?! However, I will make an effort:\r\n\r\n                    'nothing extenuate\r\n          Nor set down aught in malice.'\r\n\r\n     The respectable compiler of the _Gentleman's Magazine_, vol.\r\n     lxx. p. 178, has given us some amusing particulars of\r\n     Steevens's literary life: of his coming from Hampstead to\r\n     London, at the chill break of day, when the overhanging\r\n     clouds were yet charged with the 'inky' purple of night--in\r\n     order, like a true book-chevalier, to embrace the first dank\r\n     impression, or proof sheet, of his own famous octavo edition\r\n     of _Shakspeare_; and of Mr. Bulmer's sumptuous impression of\r\n     the text of the same. All this is well enough, and savours\r\n     of the proper spirit of BIBLIOMANIACISM: and the edition of\r\n     our immortal bard, in fifteen well printed octavo volumes,\r\n     (1793) is a splendid and durable monument of the researches\r\n     of George Steevens. There were from 20 to 25 copies of the\r\n     octavo edition printed upon LARGE PAPER; and Lord Spencer\r\n     possesses, by bequest, Mr. Steevens' own copy of the same,\r\n     illustrated with a great number of rare and precious prints;\r\n     to which, however, his Lordship, with his usual zeal and\r\n     taste, has made additions more valuable even than the gift\r\n     in its original form. The 8vo. edition of 1793 is covetted\r\n     with an eagerness of which it is not very easy to account\r\n     for the cause; since the subsequent one of 1803, in 21\r\n     octavo volumes, is more useful on many accounts: and\r\n     contains Steevens's corrections and additions in every play,\r\n     as well as 177, in particular, in that of Macbeth. But I am\r\n     well aware of the stubbornness and petulancy with which the\r\n     previous edition is contended for in point of superiority,\r\n     both round a private and public table; and, leaving the\r\n     collector to revel in the luxury of an uncut, half-bound,\r\n     morocco copy of the same, I push onward to a description of\r\n     the _Bibliotheca Steevensiana_. Yet a parting word\r\n     respecting this edition of 1803. I learn, from\r\n     unquestionable authority, that Steevens stipulated with the\r\n     publishers that they should pay Mr. Reed 300_l._ for\r\n     editorship, and 100_l._ to Mr. W. Harris, Librarian of the\r\n     Royal Institution, for correcting the press: nor has the\r\n     editor in his preface parted from the truth, in\r\n     acknowledging Mr. Harris to be 'an able and vigiland\r\n     [Transcriber's Note: vigilant] assistant.' Mr. H. retained,\r\n     for some time, Steevens' corrected copy of his own edition\r\n     of 1793, but he afterwards disposed of it, by public\r\n     auction, for 28_l._ He has also at this present moment, Mr.\r\n     Josiah Boydell's copy of Mr. Felton's picture of our\r\n     immortal bard; with the following inscription, painted on\r\n     the back of the pannel, by Mr. Steevens:\r\n\r\n          _May, 1797._\r\n          _Copied by Josiah Boydell, at my\r\n          request, from the remains of the\r\n          only genuine Portrait of William\r\n          Shakspeare._ GEORGE STEEVENS.\r\n\r\n     The engraved portrait of Shakspeare, prefixed to this\r\n     edition of 1803, is by no means a faithful resemblance of\r\n     Mr. Boydell's admirably executed copy in oil. The expenses\r\n     of the edition amounted to 5844_l._; but no copies now\r\n     remain with the publishers. We will now give rather a\r\n     copious, and, as it must be acknowledged, rich, sprinkling\r\n     of specimens from the _Bibliotheca Steevensiana_, in the\r\n     departments of rare OLD POETRY and THE DRAMA. But first let\r\n     us describe the title to the catalogue of the same. _A\r\n     Catalogue of the curious and valuable Library of_ GEORGE\r\n     STEEVENS, _Esq., Fellow of the Royal and Antiquary Societies\r\n     (Lately deceased).

The wit, taste, and classical\r\n     acquirements of GEORGE STEEVENS are every where recorded and\r\n     acknowledged. As an editor of his beloved Shakspeare, he\r\n     stands unrivalled; for he combined, with much recondite\r\n     learning and indefatigable research, a polish of style, and\r\n     vigour of expression, which are rarely found united in the\r\n     same person. His definitions are sometimes both happy and\r\n     singular; and his illustrations of ancient customs and\r\n     manners such as might have been expected from a head so\r\n     completely furnished, and a hand so thoroughly practised. I\r\n     will not say that George Steevens has evinced the learning\r\n     of Selden upon Drayton, or of Bentley upon Phalaris; nor did\r\n     his erudition, in truth, rise to the lofty and commanding\r\n     pitch of these his predecessors: nor does there seem much\r\n     sense or wit in hunting after every _pencil-scrap_ which\r\n     this renowned bibliomaniac committed to paper--as some sadly\r\n     bitten book-collectors give evidence of. If I have not\r\n     greatly misunderstood the characteristics of Steevens's\r\n     writings, they are these--wit, elegance, gaiety, and satire,\r\n     combined with almost perfect erudition in English dramatic\r\n     antiquities. Let us give a specimen of his classical\r\n     elegance in dignifying a subject, which will be relished\r\n     chiefly by GRANGERITES. Having learnt that a copy of\r\n     Skelton's Verses on Elinour Rummin, the famous Ale-wife of\r\n     England, with her portrait in the title-page, was in the\r\n     Library of the Cathedral of Lincoln (perhaps, formerly,\r\n     Captain Coxe's copy; vide p. 266, ante), he prevailed on the\r\n     late Dean, Sir Richard Kaye, to bring the book to London;\r\n     but as it was not suffered to go from the Dean's possession,\r\n     Mr. S. was permitted to make a _fac-simile_ drawing of the\r\n     title, at the Dean's house in Harley-street. This drawing he\r\n     gave to Richardson, the printseller, who engraved and\r\n     published it among the copies of scarce portraits to\r\n     illustrate Granger. The acquisition of this rarity produced\r\n     from him the following _Jeu d'Esprit_; the merit of which\r\n     can only be truly appreciated by those who had the pleasure\r\n     of knowing the eminent PORTRAIT COLLECTORS therein\r\n     mentioned, and whose names are printed in capital letters.\r\n\r\n          ELEONORA REDIVIVA.\r\n\r\n          To seek this Nymph among the glorious dead,\r\n          Tir'd with his search on earth, is GULSTON fled:--\r\n          Still for these charms enamoured MUSGRAVE sighs;\r\n          To clasp these beauties ardent BINDLEY dies:\r\n          For these (while yet unstaged to public view,)\r\n          Impatient BRAND o'er half the kingdom flew;\r\n          These, while their bright ideas round him play,\r\n          From Classic WESTON force the Roman lay:\r\n          Oft too, my STORER, Heaven has heard thee swear,\r\n          Not Gallia's murdered Queen was half so fair:\r\n          \"A new Europa!\" cries the exulting BULL,\r\n          \"My Granger now, I thank the gods, is full:\"--\r\n          Even CRACHERODE'S self, whom passions rarely move,\r\n          At this soft shrine has deign'd to whisper love.--\r\n          Haste then, ye swains, who RUMMING'S form adore,\r\n          Possess your Eleanour, and sigh no more.\r\n\r\n     It must be admitted that this is at once elegant and happy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     We will now say somewhat of the man himself. Mr. Steevens\r\n     lived in a retired and eligibly situated house, just on the\r\n     rise of Hampstead Heath. It was paled in; and had,\r\n     immediately before it, a verdant lawn skirted with a variety\r\n     of picturesque trees. Formerly, this house has been a\r\n     tavern, which was known by the name of the _Upper Flask_:\r\n     and which my fair readers (if a single female can have the\r\n     courage to peruse these bibliomaniacal pages) will recollect\r\n     to have been the same to which Richardson sends Clarissa in\r\n     one of her escapes from Lovelace. Here Steevens lived,\r\n     embosomed in books, shrubs, and trees: being either too coy,\r\n     or too unsociable, to mingle with his neighbours. His habits\r\n     were indeed peculiar: not much to be envied or imitated; as\r\n     they sometimes betrayed the flights of a madman, and\r\n     sometimes the asperities of a cynic. His attachments were\r\n     warm, but fickle both in choice and duration. He would\r\n     frequently part from one, with whom he had lived on terms of\r\n     close intimacy, without any assignable cause; and his\r\n     enmities, once fixed, were immovable. There was, indeed, a\r\n     kind of venom in his antipathies; nor would he suffer his\r\n     ears to be assailed, or his heat to relent, in favour of\r\n     those against whom he entertained animosities, however\r\n     capricious and unfounded. In _one_ pursuit only was he\r\n     consistent: _one_ object only did he woo with an inflexible\r\n     attachment; and that object was _Dame_ DRAMA.\r\n\r\n     I have sat behind him, within a few years of his death, and\r\n     watched his sedulous attention to the performances of\r\n     strolling players, who used to hire a public room in\r\n     Hampstead; and towards whom his gallantry was something more\r\n     substantial than mere admiration and applause: for he would\r\n     make liberal presents of gloves, shoes, and\r\n     stockings--especially to the female part of the company. His\r\n     attention, and even delight, during some of the most\r\n     wretched exhibitions of the dramatic art, was truly\r\n     surprising; but he was then drooping under the pressure of\r\n     age, and what passed before him might serve to remind him of\r\n     former days, when his discernment was quick and his judgment\r\n     matured. It is, however, but justice to this distinguished\r\n     bibliomaniac to add that, in his literary attachments he was\r\n     not influenced by merely splendid talents or exalted rank.\r\n     To my predecessor HERBERT (for whose memory I may be\r\n     allowed, at all times, to express a respectful regard)\r\n     Steevens seems to have shewn marked attention. I am in\r\n     possession of more than a dozen original letters from him to\r\n     this typographical antiquary, in which he not only evinces\r\n     great friendliness of disposition, but betrays an unusual\r\n     solicitude about the success of Herbert's labours; and,\r\n     indeed, contributes towards it by nearly a hundred notices\r\n     of rare and curious books which were unknown to, or\r\n     imperfectly described by, Herbert himself. At the close of a\r\n     long letter, in which, amongst much valuable information,\r\n     there is a curious list of CHURCHYARD'S _Pieces_--which\r\n     Steevens urges Herbert to publish--he thus concludes:\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"I know not where the foregoing lists of Churchyard's Pieces\r\n     can appear with more propriety than in a work like yours;\r\n     and I therefore venture to recommend them as worth\r\n     republication. If you publish, from time to time, additions\r\n     to your book, you may have frequent opportunity of doing\r\n     similar service to old English literature, by assembling\r\n     catalogues of the works of scarce, and therefore almost\r\n     forgotten, authors. By occasional effusions of this kind you\r\n     will afford much gratification to literary antiquaries, and\r\n     preserve a constant source of amusement to yourself: for in\r\n     my opinion, no man is so unhappy as he who is at a loss for\r\n     something to do. Your present task grows towards an end, and\r\n     I therefore throw out this hint for your consideration.\"\r\n     (_July_ 27, 1789.)\r\n\r\n     A little further he adds: \"In your vol. ii. p. 1920, you\r\n     have but an imperfect account of TYRO'S '_Roaring Megge_,'\r\n     &c. I shall therefore supply it underneath, as the book now\r\n     lies before me. I have only room left to tell you I am\r\n     always your very faithfully, G. STEEVENS.\" But the\r\n     bibliomanical spirit of the author of this letter, is\r\n     attested by yet stronger evidence:\r\n\r\n     _Hampstead Heath_, August 42th [Transcriber's Note: 12th],\r\n     1780.\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"I have borrowed the following books for your use--Dr.\r\n     Farmer's copy of Ames, with MS. notes by himself, and an\r\n     interleaved Maunsell's Catalogue, with yet more considerable\r\n     additions by Baker the antiquary. The latter I have promised\r\n     to return at the end of this month, as it belongs to our\r\n     University Library. I should not choose to transmit either\r\n     of these volumes by any uncertain conveyance; and therefore\r\n     shall be glad if you will let me know how they may be safely\r\n     put into your hands. If you can fix a time when you shall be\r\n     in London, my servant shall wait on you with them; but I\r\n     must entreat that our library book may be detained as short\r\n     a time as possible. I flatter myself that it will prove of\r\n     some service to you, and am,\r\n\r\n     \"Your very humble Servant,\r\n\r\n     \"G. STEEVENS.\"\r\n\r\n     The following was Herbert's reply.\r\n\r\n     \"_Cheshunt_, August 20th, 1780.\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"As it must give you great satisfaction to know that the\r\n     books were received safe by me last night, it affords me\r\n     equal pleasure to send you the earliest assurance of it. I\r\n     thank you sincerely for the liberty you have allowed me of\r\n     keeping them till I come to London, on Monday, the 4th of\r\n     September; when I shall bring them with me, and hope to\r\n     return them safe at Mr. Longman's, between 10 and 11\r\n     o'clock; where, if it may be convenient to you, I shall be\r\n     very happy to meet you, and personally to thank you for the\r\n     kind assistance you have afforded me. If that may not suit\r\n     you, I will gladly wait on you where you shall appoint by a\r\n     line left there for me; and shall ever esteem myself,\r\n\r\n     \"Your most obliged humble Servant,\r\n\r\n     \"W. HERBERT.\"\r\n\r\n     The following, and the last, epistolary specimen of the\r\n     renowned G. Steevens--with which I shall treat my reader--is\r\n     of a general gossipping black-letter cast; and was written\r\n     two years before the preceding.\r\n\r\n     _Hampstead Heath_, June 26th, 1788.\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"A desire to know how you do, and why so long a time has\r\n     elapsed since you were seen in London, together with a few\r\n     queries which necessity compels me to trouble you with, must\r\n     be my apology for this invasion of your retirement. Can you\r\n     furnish me with a transcript of the title-page to Watson's\r\n     Sonnets or Love Passions, 4to. bl. l.? As they are not\r\n     mentioned by Puttenham, in 1589, they must, I think, have\r\n     appeared after that year. Can you likewise afford me any\r\n     account of a Collection of Poems, bl. l., 4to. by one John\r\n     Southern? They are addressed 'to the ryght honourable the\r\n     Earle of Oxenforde;' the famous Vere, who was so much a\r\n     favourite with Queen Elizabeth. This book, which contains\r\n     only four sheets, consists of Odes, Epitaphs, Sonnets to\r\n     Diana, &c. I bought both these books, which seem to be\r\n     uncommonly rare, at the late sale of Major Pearson's\r\n     Library. They are defective in their title-pages, and\r\n     without your assistance must, in all probability, continue\r\n     imperfect. Give me leave to add my sincere hope that your\r\n     long absence from London has not been the result of\r\n     indisposition, and that you will forgive this interruption\r\n     in your studies, from\r\n\r\n     \"Your very faithful and obedient Servant,\r\n\r\n     \"GEO. STEEVENS.\"\r\n\r\n     \"P.S. I hope your third volume is in the press, as it is\r\n     very much enquired after.\"\r\n\r\n     It is now time to bid farewell to the subject of this\r\n     tremendous note; and most sincerely do I wish I could 'draw\r\n     the curtain' upon it, and say 'good night,' with as much\r\n     cheerfulness and satisfaction at [Transcriber's Note: as]\r\n     Atterbury did upon the close of his professional labours.\r\n     But the latter moments of STEEVENS were moments of mental\r\n     anguish. He grew not only irritable, but outrageous; and, in\r\n     full possession of his faculties, he raved in a manner which\r\n     could have been expected only from a creature bred up\r\n     without notions of morality or religion. Neither complacency\r\n     nor 'joyful hope' soothed his bed of death. His language\r\n     was, too frequently, the language of imprecation; and his\r\n     wishes and apprehensions such as no rational Christian can\r\n     think upon without agony of heart. Although I am not\r\n     disposed to admit the whole of the testimony of the good\r\n     woman who watched by his bed-side, and paid him, when dead,\r\n     the last melancholy attentions of her office--although my\r\n     prejudices (as they may be called) will not allow me to\r\n     believe that the windows shook, and that strange noises and\r\n     deep groans were heard at midnight in his room--yet no\r\n     creature of common sense (and this woman possessed the\r\n     quality in an eminent degree) could mistake oaths for\r\n     prayers, or boisterous treatment for calm and gentle usage.\r\n     If it be said--why\r\n\r\n          \"draw his frailties from their drear abode?\"\r\n\r\n     the answer is obvious, and, I should hope, irrefragable. A\r\n     duty, and a sacred one too, is due TO THE LIVING. Past\r\n     examples operate upon future ones: and posterity ought to\r\n     know, in the instance of this accomplished scholar and\r\n     literary antiquary, that neither the sharpest wit, nor the\r\n     most delicate intellectual refinement, can, alone, afford a\r\n     man 'PEACE AT THE LAST.' The vessel of human existence must\r\n     be secured by other anchors than these, when the storm of\r\n     death approaches!]\r\n\r\nLOREN. You have seen a few similar copies in the library; which I\r\nobtained after a strenuous effort. There was certainly a very great\r\ndegree of Book-Madness exhibited at the sale of Steevens's\r\nlibrary--and yet I remember to have witnessed stronger symptoms of\r\nthe Bibliomania!\r\n\r\nLIS. Can it be possible? Does this madness\r\n\r\n     'Grow with our growth, and strengthen with our strength?'\r\n\r\nWill not such volcanic fury burn out in time?\r\n\r\nPHIL. You prevent Lysander from resuming, by the number and rapidity\r\nof your interrogatories. Revert to your first question.\r\n\r\nLIS. Truly, I forget it. But proceed with your history, Lysander; and\r\npardon my abruptness.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Upon condition that you promise not to interrupt me again this\r\nevening?\r\n\r\nLIS. I pledge my word. Proceed.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Having dispatched our account of the sale of the\r\nlast-mentioned distinguished book-collector, I proceed with my\r\nhistorical survey: tho', indeed, it is high time to close this\r\ntedious bibliomaniacal history. The hour of midnight has gone by:--and\r\nyet I will not _slur over_ my account of the remaining characters of\r\nrespectability.\r\n\r\nThe collections of STRANGE[410] and Woodhouse are next, in routine, to\r\nbe noticed. The catalogue of the library of the former is a great\r\nfavourite of mine: the departments into which the books are divided,\r\nand the compendious descriptions of the volumes, together with the\r\nextent and variety of the collection, may afford considerable\r\nassistance to judicious bibliomaniacs. Poor WOODHOUSE:[411] thy zeal\r\noutran thy wit: thou wert indefatigable in thy search after rare and\r\nprecious _prints and books_; and thy very choice collection of both is\r\na convincing proof that, where there is wealth and zeal,\r\nopportunities in abundance will be found for the gratification of that\r\ndarling passion, or insanity, now called by the name of Bibliomania!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 410: _Bibliotheca Strangeiana; A Catalogue of the\r\n     general, curious, and extensive Library of that\r\n     distinguished naturalist and lover of the fine arts, the\r\n     late_ JOHN STRANGE, Esq., L.L.D.

And\r\nnow--notwithstanding my former boast to do justice to the remaining\r\nbibliomaniacal characters of respectability--as I find my oral powers\r\nalmost exhausted, I shall barely mention the sales, by auction, of the\r\ncollections of WILKES, RITSON, and BOUCHER[412]--although I ought to\r\nmention the _Bibliotheca Boucheriana_ with more respect than its two\r\nimmediate predecessors; as the collector was a man endowed with\r\netymological acumen and patience; and I sincerely wish the public\r\nwere now receiving the benefit of the continuation of his Dictionary;\r\nof which the author published so excellent a specimen, comprehending\r\nonly the letter A. Dr. Jamieson has, to be sure, in a great measure\r\ndone away the melancholy impression which lexicographical readers\r\nwould otherwise have experienced--by the publication of his own\r\nunrivalled \"_Scottish Dictionary_;\" yet there is still room enough in\r\nthe literary world for a continuation of Boucher.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 412: It did not, perhaps, suit Lysander's notions\r\n     to make mention of book-sales to which no collectors' names\r\n     were affixed; but, as it has been my office, during the\r\n     whole of the above conversation, to sit in a corner and take\r\n     notes of what our book-orator has said, as well to correct\r\n     as to enlarge the narrative, I purpose, gentle reader,\r\n     prefacing the account of the above noticed three collections\r\n     by the following bibliomaniacal specimen: '_A Catalogue of a\r\n     capital and truly valuable Library, the genuine property of\r\n     a Gentleman of Fashion, highly distinguished for his fine\r\n     taste_,' &c.: sold by auction by Mr. Christie, May, 1800,\r\n     8vo. 326 articles: amount of the sale, 1828_l._ 18_s._;\r\n     being nearly 6_l._ an article.

I attended many days\r\n     during this sale; but such was the warm fire, directed\r\n     especially towards divinity, kept up during nearly the whole\r\n     of it, that it required a heavier weight of metal than I was\r\n     able to bring into the field of battle to ensure any success\r\n     in the contest. I cannot help adding that these catalogues\r\n     are wretchedly printed.]\r\n\r\nAh, well-a-day!--have I not come to the close of my BOOK-HISTORY? Are\r\nthere any other bibliomaniacs of distinction yet to notice? Yes!--I\r\nwell remember the book-sale events of the last four years. I well\r\nremember the curiosity excited by the collections of the MARQUIS OF\r\nLANSDOWNE, JOHN BRAND, ISAAC REED, RICHARD PORSON, ALEXANDER\r\nDALRYMPLE, and RICHARD GOUGH,[413] and with these I must absolutely\r\nmake my bibliomaniacal peroration! Illustrious men!----\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 413: For the same reason as has been adduced at p.\r\n     427, ante, and from a strong wish to render this _List of\r\n     Book Auctions_ as perfect as my opportunities will allow, I\r\n     shall persevere, at the foot of Lysander's narrative, in\r\n     submitting to the attention of the curious reader a still\r\n     further account of sales than those above alluded to in the\r\n     text. As this will be the last note in PART V., I hope,\r\n     however late the hour, or exhausted his patience, that the\r\n     reader will also persevere to the close of it, and then wish\r\n     the author \"good night,\" along with his friends, whose\r\n     salutations are above so dramatically described. At the very\r\n     opening of the year in which Mr. Boucher's books were sold,\r\n     the magnificent collection of the Marquis of Lansdowne was\r\n     disposed of. I well remember the original destination of\r\n     this numerous library: I well remember the long, beautiful,\r\n     and classically ornamented room, in which, embellished and\r\n     guarded by busts, and statues of gods and heroes, the books\r\n     were ranged in quiet and unmolested order, adjoining to the\r\n     noblest mansion in London. If the consideration of external,\r\n     or out-of-door, objects be put out of the question, this\r\n     Library-room had not its superior in Great Britain.

Mirabeau, Turgot,\r\n     Barrere, Calonne, Necker, &c. 168 0 0\r\n\r\n     I should observe that the PRINTS or ENGRAVINGS of the\r\n     Marquis, together with the _printed prices_ for which they,\r\n     and the foregoing library, were sold, are usually added to\r\n     the Catalogue of the Books. In the spring of 1807, the\r\n     MANUSCRIPTS belonging to the same noble collector were\r\n     catalogued to be sold by public auction. These manuscripts,\r\n     in the preface of the _first_ volume of the Catalogue, are\r\n     said to 'form one of the noblest and most valuable private\r\n     collections in the kingdom.' It is well known that the\r\n     collection never came to the hammer; but was purchased by\r\n     parliament for 6000_l._, and is deposited in the British\r\n     Museum. A catalogue of it is now _sub prelo_; vide p. 89,\r\n     ante. We are next to notice the sale by auction of the\r\n     library of the late Rev. John Brand. The first part of this\r\n     collection was disposed of in the Spring of 1807; and the\r\n     catalogue had this title: _Bibliotheca Brandiana.

The _second part_ of the BIBLIOTHECA BRANDIANA,\r\n     containing duplicates and Pamphlets, was sold in February,\r\n     1808, by Mr. Stewart. There were 4064 articles. Few\r\n     collections attracted greater attention before, and during,\r\n     the sale than did the library of the late Mr. Isaac Reed: a\r\n     critic and literary character of very respectable\r\n     second-rate reputation. The public Journals teemed, for a\r\n     time, with book-anecdotes concerning this collection; and\r\n     the _Athenæum_, _Monthly Mirror_, _Censura Literaria_,\r\n     _European Magazine_, struck out a more bold outline of the\r\n     Bibliotheca Reediana than did the generality of their fellow\r\n     Journals. Reed's portrait is prefixed to the European\r\n     Magazine, the Monthly Mirror, and the Catalogue of his own\r\n     Books: it is an indifferently stippled scraping, copied from\r\n     a fine mellow mezzotint, from the characteristic pencil of\r\n     Romney. This latter is a private plate, and, as such, is\r\n     rare. To return to the Library. The preface to the Catalogue\r\n     was written by the Rev. H.J. Todd. It is brief, judicious,\r\n     and impressive; giving abundant proof of the bibliomaniacal\r\n     spirit of the owner of the library--who would appear to have\r\n     adopted the cobler's well-known example of applying one room\r\n     to almost every domestic purpose: for Reed made his library\r\n     'his parlour, kitchen, and hall.' A brave and enviable\r\n     spirit this!--and, in truth, what is comparable with it? But\r\n     the reader is beginning to wax impatient for a more\r\n     particular account. Here it is: _Bibliotheca Reediana. A\r\n     Catalogue of the curious and extensive Library of the late\r\n     Isaac Reed, Esq., of Staple Inn, deceased.

But\r\n     prosterity [Transcriber's Note: posterity] are not to judge\r\n     of the prevalence of knowledge in these times by the\r\n     criterion of, what are technically called, _book-sales_\r\n     only. They should be told that, within the same twelve\r\n     months, thousands and tens of thousands of books of all\r\n     sorts have been circulated by the _London Booksellers_; and\r\n     that, without travelling to know the number disposed of at\r\n     Bristol, Liverpool, York, Manchester, or Exeter, it may be\r\n     only necessary to state that _one distinguished House_\r\n     alone, established not quite a furlong from the railings of\r\n     St. Paul's Cathedral, sold not far short of _two hundred\r\n     thousand volumes_ within the foregoing period! If learning\r\n     continue thus to thrive, and books to be considered as\r\n     necessary furniture to an apartment; if wealthy merchants\r\n     are resolved upon procuring Large Paper copies, as well as\r\n     Indian spices and Russian furs; we may hail, in\r\n     anticipation, that glorious period when the book-fairs of\r\n     _Leipsic_ shall be forgotten in the superior splendour of\r\n     those of _London_! But to return to our chronological order:\r\n     The ensuing year, 1808, was distinguished for no small\r\n     mischief excited in the bibliomaniacal world by the sales of\r\n     many curious and detached libraries. The second part of Mr.\r\n     Brand's collection which was sold in the spring of this\r\n     year, has been already noticed. The close of the year\r\n     witnessed the sales, by auction, of the books of SAMUEL\r\n     EWER, Esq. (retiring into the country), and of Mr. MACHEL\r\n     STACE, bookseller. The former collection was very strong in\r\n     bibliography; and the latter presented a singularly valuable\r\n     'Collection of rare and select' books, relating to old\r\n     English Literature elegantly bound: containing 2607\r\n     articles. Mr. Stace had published, the preceding year, '_A\r\n     Catalogue of curious and scarce Books and Tracts_:' which,\r\n     with the preceding, merit a snug place upon the\r\n     bibliographer's shelf. We now enter upon a more busy year of\r\n     sales of books by auction. The Bibliomania had only\r\n     increased by the preceding displays of precious and\r\n     magnificent volumes. And first came on, in magnitude and\r\n     inportance [Transcriber's Note: importance], the sales of\r\n     ALEXANDER DALRYMPLE and PROFESSOR PORSON. Of these in turn.\r\n     _A Catalogue of the extensive and valuable Library of Books:\r\n     Part I. Late the property of_ ALEX. DALRYMPLE, Esq. F.R.S.,\r\n     _deceased_. Hydrographer to the Board of Admiralty, and the\r\n     Hon. East India Company, &c., sold by auction by King and\r\n     Lochée, May 29, 1809, 8vo.--7190 articles: _A Catalogue,\r\n     &c., Part II. of the same: sold by auction by the same_:\r\n     Nov. 1809.--8897 articles. I should add that there is a\r\n     stippled engraving of Dalrymple, with fac-simile of his\r\n     hand-writing, which faces the title page to _Part First_ of\r\n     this extraordinary and numerous collection; of books of\r\n     Geography, Voyages, and Travels. I strongly recommend copies\r\n     of these catalogues to be in every library of extent and\r\n     utility. We are now to notice: _A Catalogue of Part of the\r\n     Library of the late Richard Porson, A.M., Greek Professor of\r\n     the University of Cambridge_, &c.: sold by auction by Leigh\r\n     and Sotheby, June 16th, 1809, 8vo.--1391 articles: amount of\r\n     the books, 1254_l._ 18_s._ 6_d._ The subjoined is rather a\r\n     rich, though brief, specimen of some of the valuable books\r\n     contained in the library of this profound Greek scholar; in\r\n     whom the acuteness of Bentley, and the erudition of\r\n     Hemsterhusius, were more than revived.\r\n\r\n     NO. 116.

Among the latter, there is\r\n     an interesting one by Dr. Adam Clarke in the _Classical\r\n     Journal_, no. IV., p. 720. The _hand-writing_ of Porson\r\n     is a theme of general admiration, and justly so; but his\r\n     _Greek_ characters have always struck me as being more stiff\r\n     and cramped than his Roman and Italic. I well remember when\r\n     he shewed me, and expatiated eloquently upon, the famous MS.\r\n     of Plato, of the 10th century. Poor Fillingham was of the\r\n     party. Little did I then expect that three years only would\r\n     deprive the world of its great classical ornament, and\r\n     myself of a well-informed and gentle-hearted friend! We will\r\n     now close our account of the book-ravages in the year 1809,\r\n     by noticing the dispersion of a few minor corps of\r\n     bibliomaniacal troops, in the shape of printed volumes.\r\n     _Bibliotheca Maddisoniana: A Catalogue of the extensive and\r\n     valuable library of the late_ JOHN MADDISON, _Esq., of the\r\n     foreign department in the Post Office, &c._: sold by auction\r\n     by King and Lochée, March, 1809, 8vo. A judicious and\r\n     elegant collection. 5239 articles. II. _A Catalogue of a\r\n     curious, valuable, and rare collection of Books in\r\n     Typography, History, Voyages, Early English Poetvy\r\n     [Transcriber's Note: Poetry], Romances, Classics_, &c.: the\r\n     property of a Collector well known for his literary taste,\r\n     &c. Sold by auction by Mr. Stewart, April, 1809, 8vo. Some\r\n     curious volumes were in these 1858 articles or lots. III. _A\r\n     Catalogue of the very valuable and elegant Library of_\r\n     EMPEROR JOHN ALEXANDER WOODFORD, Esq., sold by auction by\r\n     Leigh and Sotheby, May, 1809, 8vo.--1773 articles. This was\r\n     a sumptuous collection; and the books, in general, brought\r\n     large prices, from being sharply contended for. IV. _A\r\n     Catalogue of the interesting and curious historical and\r\n     biographical part of the_ LIBRARY OF A GENTLEMAN,\r\n     particularly interesting, during the reign of Elizabeth, the\r\n     grand rebellion, the usurpation, restoration, and\r\n     abdication, &c., sold by auction by Leigh and Sotheby, in\r\n     May, 1809, 8vo. Only 806 articles; but a singularly curious\r\n     and elegant collection; the catalogue of which I strongly\r\n     recommend to all 'curious, prying, and inquisitive'\r\n     bibliomaniacs. The first half of the ensuing year, 1810, was\r\n     yet more distinguished for the zeal and energy--shall I say\r\n     MADNESS?--displayed at BOOK-AUCTIONS. The sale of Mr.\r\n     Gough's books excited an unusual ferment among English\r\n     antiquaries: but the sale of a more extensive, and truly\r\n     beautifully classical, collection in Pall Mall, excited\r\n     still stronger sensations. As the _prices_ for some of the\r\n     articles sold in the Gough collection have already been\r\n     printed in the _Gentleman's Magazine_, vol. lxxx., pt. ii.,\r\n     and as those for which some of the _latter_ collection were\r\n     sold, appeared in the 4th number of _The Classical Journal_,\r\n     it only remains for me to subjoin the following account. I.\r\n     _A Catalogue of the entire and valuable Library (with the\r\n     exception of the department of Topography, bequeathed to the\r\n     Bodleian Library) of that eminent antiquary_, RICHARD GOUGH,\r\n     Esq., deceased, &c., sold by auction by Leigh and Sotheby,\r\n     April, 1810, 8vo.--4082 articles. The MANUSCRIPTS conclude\r\n     the catalogue, at no. 4373. Prefixed to the printed\r\n     books, there is an account of the collector, Mr. Gough,\r\n     executed by the faithful pen of Mr. Nichols. My own humble\r\n     opinion of this celebrated antiquary has already been before\r\n     the public: _Typog. Antiquit._, vol. I., 21. II. _A\r\n     Catalogue of books containing all the rare, useful, and\r\n     valuable publications in every department of Literature,\r\n     from the first invention of Printing to the present time,\r\n     all of which are in the most perfect condition, &c._: sold\r\n     by auction by Mr. Jeffery, May, 1810, 8vo.--4809 articles.\r\n     Another Catalogue of the same collection, elegantly printed\r\n     in royal octavo, but omitting the auctioneer's notices of\r\n     the relative value of certain editions, was published by Mr.\r\n     Constable of Edinburgh, bookseller: with the prices and\r\n     purchasers' names subjoined: and of which it is said only\r\n     250 copies are printed. The REV. MR. HEATH is reported to\r\n     have been the owner of this truly select and sumptuous\r\n     classical library: the sale of which produced 9000_l._ Never\r\n     did the bibliomaniac's eye alight upon 'sweeter copies'--as\r\n     the phrase is; and never did the bibliomaniacal barometer\r\n     rise higher than at this sale! The most marked phrensy\r\n     characterized it. A copy of the Editio Princeps of Homer (by\r\n     no means a first-rate one) brought 92_l._: and all the\r\n     ALDINE CLASSICS produced such an electricity of sensation\r\n     that buyers stuck at nothing to embrace them! Do not let it\r\n     hence be said that _black-letter lore_ is the only\r\n     fashionable pursuit of the present age of book-collectors.\r\n     This sale may be hailed as the omen of better and brighter\r\n     prospects in Literature in general: and many a useful\r\n     philological work, although printed in the Latin or Italian\r\n     language--and which had been sleeping, unmolested, upon a\r\n     bookseller's shelf these dozen years--will now start up from\r\n     its slumber, and walk abroad in a new atmosphere, and be\r\n     noticed and 'made much of.'\r\n\r\n     Here I terminate my _annotation labours_ relating to\r\n     ANECDOTES OF BOOK-COLLECTORS, and ACCOUNTS OF BOOK-AUCTIONS.\r\n     Unless I am greatly deceived, these labours have not been\r\n     thrown away. They may serve, as well to awaken curiosity in\r\n     regard to yet further interesting memoranda respecting\r\n     scholars, as to shew the progressive value of books, and the\r\n     increase of the disease called the BIBLIOMANIA. Some of the\r\n     most curious volumes in English literature have in these\r\n     notes, been duly recorded; nor can I conclude such a\r\n     laborious, though humble, task, without indulging a fond\r\n     hope that this account will be consulted by all those who\r\n     make book-collecting their amusement. But it is now time to\r\n     rise up, with the company described in the text, and to put\r\n     on my hat and great-coat. So I make my bow, wishing, with\r\n     _L'Envoy_ at the close of MARMION,\r\n\r\n          To all, to each, a fair good night,\r\n          And pleasing dreams, and slumbers light.]\r\n\r\nLOREN. Do you mean to have it inferred that there were no collections,\r\nof value or importance, which were sold in the mean time?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. I thank you for stopping me: for I am hoarse as well as\r\nstupid: I consider the foregoing only as the greater stars or\r\nconstellations in the bibliographical hemisphere. Others were less\r\nobserved from their supposed comparative insignificancy; although, if\r\nyou had attended the auctions, you would have found in them many very\r\nuseful, and even rare and splendid, productions. But we are all\r\n\r\n     'Tickled with the whistling of a name!'\r\n\r\nLOREN. Ay, and naturally enough too. If I look at my Stubbes's\r\n_Anatomy of Abuses_, which has received _your abuse_ this evening, and\r\nfancy that the leaves have been turned over by the scientific hand of\r\nPearson, Farmer, or Steevens, I experience, by association of ideas, a\r\ndegree of happiness which I never could have enjoyed had I obtained\r\nthe volume from an unknown collector's library.\r\n\r\nLIS. Very true; and yet you have only Master Stubbes's work after\r\nall!\r\n\r\nLOREN. Even so. But this _fictitious_ happiness, as you would call it,\r\nis, in effect, _real_ happiness; inasmuch as it produces positive\r\nsensations of delight.\r\n\r\nLIS. Well, there is no arguing with such a bibliomaniac as yourself,\r\nLorenzo.\r\n\r\nBELIN. But allow, brother, that this degree of happiness, of which\r\nyou boast, is not quite so exquisite as to justify the very high terms\r\nof purchase upon which it is often times procured.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. There is no such thing as the 'golden mediocrity' of Horace in\r\nbook pursuits. Certain men set their hearts upon certain copies, and\r\n'_coûte qu'il coûte_' they must secure them. Undoubtedly, I would\r\ngive not a little for Parker's own copy of the Book of _Common\r\nPrayer_, and Shakspeare's own copy of both parts of his _Henry the\r\nFourth_.\r\n\r\nALMAN. Well, Lisardo, we stand no chance of stemming the torrent\r\nagainst two such lusty and opiniated bibliomaniacs as my brother and\r\nLysander: although I should speak with deference of, and acknowledge\r\nwith grateful respect, the extraordinary exertions of the latter, this\r\nevening, to amuse and instruct us.\r\n\r\nLIS. This evening?----say, this day:--this live-long day--and\r\nyesterday also! But have you quite done, dear Lysander?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Have you the conscience to ask for more? I have brought you\r\ndown to the year of our Lord _One thousand eight hundred and eleven_;\r\nand without touching upon the collections of LIVING BIBLIOMANIACS, or\r\nforetelling what may be the future ravages of the Bibliomania in the\r\ncourse of only the next dozen years, I think it proper to put an end\r\nto my BOOK-COLLECTING HISTORY, and more especially to this long trial\r\nof your auricular patience.\r\n\r\nLOREN. A thousand thanks for your exertions! Although your friend,\r\nwith whom you are on a visit, knows pretty well the extent of my\r\nbibliographical capacity, and that there have been many parts in your\r\nnarrative which were somewhat familiar to me, yet, upon the whole,\r\nthere has been a great deal more of novelty, and, in this novelty, of\r\nsolid instruction. Sincerely, therefore Lysander, I here offer you my\r\nheart-felt thanks.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. I receive them as cordially: from an assurance that my\r\ndigressions have been overlooked; or, if noticed, forgiven. It would\r\nbe gross vanity, and grosser falsehood, to affirm that the discourse\r\nof this day, on my part, has given anything like a full and explicit\r\nhistory of all the most eminent book-collectors and patrons of\r\nLearning which have reflected such lustre upon the literary annals of\r\nour country:--No, Lorenzo: a complete account, or a perfect\r\ndescription, of these illustrious characters would engage a\r\nconversation, not for one day--but one week. Yet I have made the most\r\nof the transient hour, and, by my enthusiasm, have perhaps atoned for\r\nmy deficiency of information.\r\n\r\nLIS. But cannot you resume this conversation on the morrow?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. My stay with our friend is short, and I know not how he means\r\nto dispose of me to-morrow. But I have done--certainly done--with\r\n_Personal History_!\r\n\r\nLOREN. That may be. Yet there are other departments of the Bibliomania\r\nwhich may be successfully discussed. The weather will probably be\r\nfine, and let us enjoy a morning _conversazione_ in THE ALCOVE?\r\n\r\nBELIN. Surely, Lysander may find something in the fruitful\r\npigeon-holes of his imagination--as the Abbè Sieyes used to do--from\r\nwhich he may draw forth some system or other?\r\n\r\nALMAN. You have all talked loudly and learnedly of the BOOK-DISEASE;\r\nbut I wish to know whether a _mere collector_ of books be a\r\nbibliomaniac?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Certainly not. There are SYMPTOMS of this disease _within the\r\nvery books themselves_ of a bibliomaniac.\r\n\r\nALMAN. And pray what are these?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Alas, madam!--why are you so unreasonable? And how, after\r\nknowing that I have harrangued for more than 'seven hours by\r\nWestminster clock'--how can you have the conscience to call upon me to\r\nprotract the oration? The night has already melted into morning; and I\r\nsuppose grey twilight is discoverable upon the summit of the hills. I\r\nam exhausted; and long for repose. Indeed, I must wish you all a good\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nBELIN. But you promise to commence your _symptomatic_ harangue on the\r\nmorrow?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. If my slumbers are sound, lady fair, and I rise tolerably\r\nrecruited in strength, I will surely make good my promise. Again, good\r\nnight!\r\n\r\nBELIN. Sir, a very good night: and let our best thanks follow you to\r\nyour pillow.\r\n\r\nALMAN. Remember, as you sink to repose, what a quantity of good you\r\nhave done, by having imparted such useful information.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. I shall carry your best wishes, and grateful mention of my\r\npoor labours, with me to my orisons. Adieu!--'tis very late.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere the company broke up. Lisardo slept at Lorenzo's. Philemon and\r\nLysander accompanied me to my home; and as we past Lorenzo's outer\r\ngate, and looked backward upon the highest piece of rising ground, we\r\nfancied we saw the twilight of morning. Never was a mortal more\r\nheartily thanked for his colloquial exertions than was Lysander. On\r\nreaching home, as we separated for our respective chambers, we shook\r\nhands most cordially; and my eloquent guest returned the squeeze, in a\r\nmanner which seemed to tell that he had no greater happiness at heart\r\nthan that of finding a reciprocity of sentiment among those whom he\r\ntenderly esteemed. At this moment, we could have given to each other\r\nthe choicest volume in our libraries; and I regretted that I had not\r\ncontrived to put my black-morocco copy of the small _Aldine Petrarch,\r\nprinted upon_ VELLUM, under Lysander's pillow, as a 'Pignus\r\nAmicitiæ.'--But we were all to assemble together in Lorenzo's ALCOVE\r\non the morrow; and this thought gave me such lively pleasure that I\r\ndid not close my eyes 'till the clock had struck five. Such are the\r\nbed-luxuries of a Bibliomaniac!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The reader is here presented with one of the \"Facs,\" or\r\nornamental letters in _Pierce Ploughman's Creed_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VI.\r\n\r\n=The Alcove.=\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS OF THE BIBLIOMANIA.----PROBABLE MEANS OF ITS CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"One saith this booke is too long: another, too short: the\r\n     third, of due length; and for fine phrase and style, the\r\n     like [of] that booke was not made a great while.

So early a visitor put the whole house in\r\ncommotion; nor was it without betraying some marks of peevishness and\r\nirritability that, on being informed of his arrival, I sent word by\r\nthe servant to know what might be the cause of such an interruption.\r\nThe reader will readily forgive this trait of harshness and\r\nprecipitancy, on my part, when he is informed that I was then just\r\nenjoying the \"honey dew\" of sleep, after many wakeful and restless\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nLisardo's name was announced: and his voice, conveyed in the sound of\r\nsong-singing, from the bottom of the garden, left the name of the\r\nvisitor no longer in doubt. I made an effort, and sprung from my bed;\r\nand, on looking through the venetian blinds, I discovered our young\r\nbibliomaniacal convert with a book sticking out of his pocket, another\r\nhalf opened in his hand (upon which his eyes were occasionally cast),\r\nand a third kept firmly under his left arm. I thrust my head,\r\n\"night-cap, tassel and all,\" out of window, and hailed him; not,\r\nhowever, before a delicious breeze, wafted over a bed of mignonette,\r\nhad electrified me in a manner the most agreeable imaginable.\r\n\r\nLisardo heard, and hailed me in return. His eyes sparkled with joy;\r\nhis step was quick and elastic; and an unusual degree of animation\r\nseemed to pervade his whole frame. \"Here,\" says he, \"here is _The\r\nBritish Bibliographer_[414] in my hand, a volume of Mr. Beloe's\r\n_Anecdotes of Literature and Scarce Books_ in my pocket, while\r\nanother, of Mr. D'Israeli's _Curiosities of Literature_, is kept\r\nsnugly under my arm, as a corps de reserve, or rallying point. If\r\nthese things savour not of bibliography, I must despair of ever\r\nattaining to the exalted character of a Bibliomaniac!\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 414: _The British Bibliographer_ is a periodical\r\n     publication; being a continuation of a similar work under\r\n     the less popular title of _The Censura Literaria_;\r\n     concerning which see p. 52, ante. It is a pity that Mr.\r\n     Savage does not continue his _British Librarian_; (of which\r\n     18 numbers are already published) as it forms a creditable\r\n     supplement to Oldys's work under a similar title; vide p.\r\n     51, ante. A few of the ensuing numbers might be well devoted\r\n     to an analysis of _Sir William Dugdale's_ works, with\r\n     correct lists of the plates in the same.]\r\n\r\n\"You are up betimes,\" said I. \"What dream has disturbed your rest?\"\r\n\"None\" replied he; \"but the most delightful visions have appeared to\r\nme during my sleep. Since you left Lorenzo's, I have sipt nectar with\r\nLeland, and drunk punch with Bagford. Richard Murray has given me a\r\ncopy of Rastell's _Pastime of People_,[415] and Thomas Britton has\r\nbequeathed to me an entire library of the Rosicrusian[416] philosophy.\r\nMoreover, the venerable form of Sir Thomas Bodley has approached me;\r\nreminding me of my solemn promise to spend a few autumnal weeks,[417]\r\nin the ensuing year, within the precincts of his grand library. In\r\nshort, half the bibliomaniacs, whom Lysander so enthusiastically\r\ncommended last night, have paid their devoirs to me in my dreams, and\r\nnothing could be more handsome than their conduct towards me.\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 415: The reader may have met with some slight\r\n     notices of this curious work in pp. 331; 337; 385; 392; 417;\r\n     ante.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 416: See p. 332, ante.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 417: See p. 49, ante.]\r\n\r\nThis discourse awakened my friends, Lysander and Philemon; who each,\r\nfrom different rooms, put their heads out of window, and hailed the\r\nnewly-risen sun with night caps which might have been mistaken for\r\nPersian turbans. Such an unexpected sight caused Lisardo to burst out\r\ninto a fit of laughter, and to banter my guests in his usual strain of\r\nvivacity. But on our promising him that we would speedily join his\r\nperipatetic bibliographical reveries, he gave a turn towards the left,\r\nand was quickly lost in a grove of Acacia and Laurustinus. For my\r\npart, instead of keeping this promise, I instinctively sought my bed;\r\nand found the observation of Franklin,--of air-bathing being\r\nfavourable to slumber,--abundantly verified--for I was hardly settled\r\nunder the clothes 'ere I fell asleep: and, leaving my guests to make\r\ngood their appointment with my visitor, I enjoyed a sweet slumber of\r\nmore than two hours.\r\n\r\nAs early rising produces a keen appetite for bodily, as well as\r\nmental, gratification, I found my companions clamorous for their\r\nbreakfast. A little before ten o'clock, we were all prepared to make a\r\nformal attack upon muffins, cake, coffee, tea, eggs, and cold tongue.\r\nThe window was thrown open; and through the branches of the clustering\r\nvine, which covered the upper part of it, the sun shot a warmer ray;\r\nwhile the spicy fragrance from surrounding parterres, and jessamine\r\nbowers, made even such bibliomaniacs as my guests forgetful of the\r\ngaily-coated volumes which surrounded them. At length the conversation\r\nwas systematically commenced on the part of Lysander.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. To-morrow, Philemon and myself take our departure. We would\r\nwillingly have staid the week; but business of a pressing nature calls\r\n_him_ to Manchester--and _myself_ to Bristol and Exeter.\r\n\r\nLIS. Some bookseller,[418] I warrant, has published a thumping\r\ncatalogue at each of these places. Ha!--here I have you, sober-minded\r\nLysander! You are as arrant a book-madman as any of those renowned\r\nbibliomaniacs whom you celebrated yesterday evening!--Yet, if you love\r\nme, take me with you! My pistoles are not exhausted.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 418: I ought to have noticed, under Lysander's\r\n     eulogy upon _London Booksellers_ (see p. 308, ante) the very\r\n     handsome manner in which Mr. Roscoe alludes to their\r\n     valuable catalogues--as having been of service to him in\r\n     directing his researches into foreign literature. His words\r\n     are these: \"The rich and extensive Catalogues published by\r\n     EDWARDS, PAYNE, and other _London Booksellers_, who have of\r\n     late years diligently sought for, and imported into England,\r\n     whatever is curious or valuable in foreign literature, have\r\n     also contributed to the success of my inquiries.\" _Lorenzo\r\n     de Medici_: pref. p. XXVII., edit. 1800, 8vo.]\r\n\r\nPHIL. Peace, Lisardo!--but you are, in truth, a bit of a prophet. It\r\nis even as you surmise. We have each received a forwarded letter,\r\ninforming us of very choice and copious collections of books about to\r\nbe sold at these respective places. While I take my departure for Mr.\r\nFord of Manchester, Lorenzo is about to visit the book-treasures of\r\nMr. Dyer of Exeter, and Mr. Gutch of Bristol:--but, indeed, were not\r\nthis the case, our abode here must terminate on the morrow.\r\n\r\nLIS. I suppose the names you have just mentioned describe the\r\nprincipal booksellers at the several places you intend visiting.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Even so: yet I will make no disparaging comparisons.[419] We\r\nspeak only of what has come within our limited experience. There may\r\nbe many brave and sagacious bibliopolists whose fame has not reached\r\nour ears, nor perhaps has any one of the present circle ever heard of\r\nthe late Mr. Miller of Bungay;[420] who, as I remember my father to\r\nhave said, in spite of blindness and multifarious occupations,\r\nattached himself to the book-selling trade with inconceivable ardour\r\nand success. But a word, Lisardo!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 419: Lysander is right. Since the note upon Mr.\r\n     Ford's catalogue of 1810 was written (see p. 123, ante), the\r\n     same bookseller has put forth another voluminous catalogue,\r\n     of nine thousand and odd articles; forming, with the\r\n     preceding, 15,729 lots. This is doing wonders for a\r\n     provincial town; and that a _commercial_ one!! Of Mr.\r\n     Gutch's spirit and enterprise some mention has been made\r\n     before at p. 404, ante. He is, as yet, hardly _mellowed_ in\r\n     his business; but a few years only will display him as\r\n     thoroughly _ripened_ as any of his brethren. He comes from a\r\n     worthy stock; long known at our _Alma Mater\r\n     Oxoniensis_:--and as a dutiful son of my University Mother,\r\n     and in common with every one who is acquainted with his\r\n     respectable family, I wish him all the success which he\r\n     merits. Mr. George Dyer of Exeter is a distinguished\r\n     _veteran_ in the book-trade: his catalogue of 1810, in two\r\n     parts, containing 19,945 articles, has, I think, never been\r\n     equalled by that of any provincial bookseller, for the value\r\n     and singularity of the greater number of the volumes\r\n     described in it. As Lysander had mentioned the foregoing\r\n     book-vending gentlemen, I conceived myself justified in\r\n     _appending_ this note. I could speak with pleasure and\r\n     profit of the catalogues of booksellers to the _north of the\r\n     Tweed_--(see p. 415, ante); but for fear of awaking all the\r\n     frightful passions of wrath, jealousy, envy--I stop:\r\n     declaring, from the bottom of my heart, in the language of\r\n     an auld northern bard:\r\n\r\n          I hait flatterie; and into wourdis plane,\r\n          And unaffectit language, I delyte:\r\n\r\n          (_Quod Maister Alexander Arbothnat; in anno_ 1572.)]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 420: There is something so original in the\r\n     bibliomanical character of the above-mentioned Mr. Miller\r\n     that I trust the reader will forgive my saying a word or two\r\n     concerning him. Thomas Miller of Bungay, in Suffolk, was\r\n     born in 1731, and died in 1804. He was put apprentice to a\r\n     grocer in Norwich: but neither the fragrance of spices and\r\n     teas, nor the lusciousness of plums and figs, could seduce\r\n     young Miller from his darling passion of reading, and of\r\n     buying odd volumes of the _Gentleman's_ and _Universal\r\n     Magazine_ with his spare money. His genius was, however,\r\n     sufficiently versatile to embrace both trades; for in 1755,\r\n     he set up for himself in the character of _Grocer_ and\r\n     _Bookseller_. I have heard Mr. Otridge, of the Strand,\r\n     discourse most eloquently upon the brilliant manner in which\r\n     Mr. Miller conducted his complicated concerns; and which,\r\n     latterly, were devoted entirely to the _Bibliomania_.\r\n     Although Bungay was too small and obscure for a spirit like\r\n     Miller's to disclose its full powers, yet he continued in it\r\n     till his death; and added a love of portrait and coin, to\r\n     that of book, collecting. For fifty years his stock, in\r\n     these twin departments, was copious and respectable; and\r\n     notwithstanding total blindness, which afflicted him during\r\n     the last six years of his life, he displayed uncommon\r\n     cheerfulness, activity, and even skill in knowing where the\r\n     different classes of books were arranged in his shop. Mr.\r\n     Miller was a warm loyalist, and an enthusiastic admirer of\r\n     Mr. Pitt. In 1795, when provincial copper coins were very\r\n     prevalent, our bibliomaniac caused a die of himself to be\r\n     struck; intending to strike some impressions of it upon gold\r\n     and silver, as well as upon copper. He began with the\r\n     latter; and the die breaking when only 23 impressions were\r\n     struck off, Miller, in the true spirit of numismatical\r\n     _virtû_, declined having a fresh one made. View here, gentle\r\n     reader, a wood-cut taken from the same: \"This coin, which is\r\n     very finely engraved, and bears a strong profile likeness of\r\n     himself, is known to collectors by the name of 'THE MILLER\r\n     HALFPENNY.' Mr. Miller was extremely careful into whose\r\n     hands the impressions went; and they are now become so rare\r\n     as to produce at sales from three to five guineas.\"\r\n     _Gentleman's Magazine_; vol. lxxiv., p. 664.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration]]\r\n\r\nLIS.

Happy change!--and\r\nall hail this salubrious morning, which witnesses the complete and\r\neffectual conversion of Lisardo! Instead of laughing at our\r\nbook-hobbies, and ridiculing all bibliographical studies--which, even\r\nby a bibliographer in the dry department of the law, have been rather\r\neloquently defended and enforced[422]--behold this young\r\nbibliomaniacal chevalier, not daunted by the rough handling of a\r\nLondon Book-Auction, anxious to mount his courser, and scour the\r\nprovincial fields of bibliography!

(To the reader.)]\r\n\r\nLIS. From the bottom of mine, I congratulate you, Lysander, upon the\r\nresuming of your wonted spirits! I had imagined that the efforts of\r\nyesterday would have completely exhausted you. How rapturously do I\r\nlook forward for the SYMPTOMS OF THE BIBLIOMANIA to be told this\r\nmorning in Lorenzo's ALCOVE! You have not forgotten your promise!\r\n\r\nLYSAND. No, indeed; but if I am able to do justice to the elucidation\r\nof so important a subject, it will be in consequence of having enjoyed\r\na placid, though somewhat transient, slumber: notwithstanding the\r\noccurrence of a very uncommon _dream_!\r\n\r\nLIS. \"I dreamt a dream last night;\" which has been already told--but\r\nwhat was yours?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Nay, it is silly to entertain one another with stories of\r\nphantastic visions of the night. I have known the most placid-bosomed\r\nmen grow downright angry at the very introduction of such a discourse.\r\n\r\nPHIL. That may be; but we have, luckily, no such _placidly-moulded_\r\nbosoms in the present society. I love this sort of gossipping during\r\nbreakfast, of all things. If our host permit, do give us your dream,\r\nLysander!\r\n\r\nLIS. The dream!--The dream!--I entreat you.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. I fear you will fall asleep, and dream yourself, before the\r\nrecital of it be concluded. But I will get through it as well as I\r\ncan.\r\n\r\nMethought I was gently lifted from the ground into the air by a being\r\nof very superior size, but of an inexpressible sweetness of\r\ncountenance. Although astonished by the singularity of my situation, I\r\nwas far from giving way entirely to fear; but, with a mixture of\r\nanxiety and resignation, awaited the issue of the event. My Guide or\r\nProtector (for so this being must now be called) looked upon me with\r\nan air of tenderness, mingled with reproof; intimating, as I\r\nconceived, that the same superior Power, which had thus transported me\r\nabove my natural element, would of necessity keep me in safety. This\r\nquieted my apprehensions.\r\n\r\nWe had travelled together through an immensity of space, and could\r\ndiscover the world below as one small darkened spot, when my Guide\r\ninterrupted the awful silence that had been preserved, by the\r\nfollowing exclamation: \"Approach, O man, the place of thy\r\ndestination--compose thy perturbed spirits, and let all thy senses be\r\nawakened to a proper understanding of the scene which thou art about\r\nto behold.\" So saying, he moved along with an indescribable velocity;\r\nand while my eyes were dazzled by an unusual effulgence of light, I\r\nfound myself at rest upon a solid seat--formed of crystal, of\r\nprodigious magnitude.\r\n\r\nMy guide then fixed himself at my right hand, and after a vehement\r\nejaculation, accompanied by gestures, which had the effect of\r\nenchantment upon me, he extended a sceptre of massive gold, decorated\r\nwith emeralds and sapphires. Immediately there rose up a MIRROR of\r\ngigantic dimensions, around which was inscribed, in fifty languages,\r\nthe word \"TRUTH.\" I sat in mute astonishment. \"Examine,\" said my\r\nGuide, with a voice the most encouraging imaginable, \"examine the\r\nobjects reflected upon the surface of this mirror.\" \"There are none\r\nthat are discernible to my eyes,\" I replied. \"Thou shalt soon be\r\ngratified then,\" resumed this extraordinary being (with a severe smile\r\nupon his countenance), \"but first let me purge thine eyes from those\r\nfilms of prejudice which, in the world you inhabit, are apt to\r\nintercept the light of TRUTH.\" He then took a handful of aromatic\r\nherbs, and, rubbing them gently upon my temples, gave me the power of\r\ncontemplating, with perfect discernment, the objects before me.\r\n\r\nWonderful indeed was this scene: for upon the surface of the MIRROR\r\nthe whole world seemed to be reflected! At first, I could not controul\r\nmy feelings: but, like a child that springs forward to seize an object\r\ngreatly beyond its grasp, I made an effort to leave my seat, and to\r\n_mingle_ in the extraordinary scene. Here, however, my guide\r\ninterfered--and, in a manner the most peremptory and decisive, forbade\r\nall further participation of it. \"_View_ it attentively,\" replied he,\r\n\"and impress firmly on thy memory what thou shalt see--it may solace\r\nthee the remainder of thy days.\"\r\n\r\nThe authoritative air, with which these words were delivered, quite\r\nrepressed and unnerved me. I obeyed, and intently viewed the objects\r\nbefore me. The first thing that surprised me was the representation of\r\nall the metropolitan cities of Europe. London, Paris, Vienna, Berlin,\r\nand Petersburg, in particular, occupied my attention; and, what was\r\nstill _more_ surprising, I seemed to be perfect master of every event\r\ngoing on in them--but more particularly of the transactions of _Bodies\r\nCorporate_. I saw Presidents in their chairs, with Secretaries and\r\nTreasurers by their sides; and to whatever observations were made the\r\nmost implicit attention was paid. Here, an eloquent Lecturer was\r\ndeclaiming upon the beauty of morality, and the deformity of vice:\r\nthere, a scientific Professor was unlocking the hidden treasures of\r\nnature, and explaining how Providence, in all its measures, was\r\nequally wonderful and wise. The experiments which ensued, and which\r\ncorroborated his ingenious and profound remarks, suspended a\r\nwell-informed audience in rapturous attention; which was followed by\r\ninstinctive bursts of applause.\r\n\r\nAgain I turned my eyes, and, contiguous to this scene, viewed the\r\nproceedings of two learned sister Societies, distinguished for their\r\nlabours in _Philosophy_ and _Antiquity_. Methought I saw the spirits\r\nof NEWTON and of DUGDALE, looking down with complacency upon them, and\r\ncongratulating each other upon the _general_ progress of civilization\r\nsince they had ceased to mingle among men. \"These institutions,\"\r\nobserved my Guide, \"form the basis of rational knowledge, and are the\r\nsource of innumerable comforts: for the _many_ are benefitted by the\r\nresearches and experiments of the _few_. It is easy to laugh at such\r\nsocieties, but it is not quite so easy to remedy the inconveniences\r\nwhich would be felt, if they were extinct. Nations become powerful in\r\nproportion to their wisdom; it has uniformly been found that where\r\nphilosophers lived, and learned men wrote, there the arts have\r\nflourished, and heroism and patriotism have prevailed. True it is that\r\ndiscrepancies will sometimes interrupt the harmony of public bodies.\r\nBut why is perfection to be expected, where every thing must\r\nnecessarily be imperfect? It is the duty of man to make the _nearest\r\napproaches_ to public and private happiness. And if, as with a sponge,\r\nhe wipe away such establishments, genius has little incentive to\r\nexertion, and merit has still less hope of reward. Now cast your eyes\r\non a different scene.\"\r\n\r\nI obeyed, and, within the same city, saw a great number of Asylums and\r\nInstitutions for the ignorant and helpless. I saw youth instructed,\r\nage protected, the afflicted comforted, and the diseased cured. My\r\nemotions at this moment were wonderfully strong--they were perceived\r\nby my guide, who immediately begged of me to consider the manner by\r\nwhich _epidemic maladies_ were prevented or alleviated, and especially\r\nhow _the most fatal of them_ had been arrested in its progress. I\r\nattentively examined the objects before me, and saw thousands of\r\nsmiling children and enraptured mothers walking confidently 'midst\r\nplague and death! I saw them, happy in the protection which had been\r\nafforded them by the most useful and most nutritious of animals!\r\n\"Enough,\" exclaimed my guide, \"thou seest here the glorious result of\r\na philosophical mind, gifted with unabatable ardour of experiment.\r\nThou wilt acknowledge that, compared with the triumph which SUCH A\r\nMIND enjoys, the conquests of heroes are puerile, and the splendour of\r\nmonarchy is dim!\" During this strain, I fancied I could perceive the\r\nhuman being, alluded to by my guide, retire apart in conversation with\r\nanother distinguished friend of humanity, by those unwearied exertions\r\nthe condition of many thousand poor people had been meliorated.\r\n\r\n\"There is yet,\" resumed my guide, \"another scene equally interesting\r\nas the preceding. From a pure morality flows a pure religion: look\r\ntherefore on those engaged in the services of CHRISTIANITY.\" I\r\nlooked, and saw a vast number of my fellow-creatures prostrate in\r\nadoration before their Creator and Redeemer. I fancied I could hear\r\nthe last strains of their hallelujahs ascending to the spot whereon I\r\nsat. \"Observe,\" said my Protector, \"all do not worship in the same\r\nmanner, because all assent not to the same creed; but the intention of\r\neach may be pure: at least, common charity teaches us thus to think,\r\ntill some open act betray a malignity of principle. Toleration is the\r\nvital spark of religion: arm the latter with the whips of persecution,\r\nand you convert her into a fiend scattering terror and dismay! In your\r\nown country you enjoy a liberty of sentiment beyond every other on the\r\nface of the globe. Learn to be grateful for such an inestimable\r\nhappiness.\"\r\n\r\nThese words had hardly escaped my guide, when I was irresistibly led\r\nto look on another part of the Mirror where a kind of imperial\r\nmagnificence, combined with the severest discipline, prevailed. \"You\r\nare contemplating,\" resumed my preternatural Monitor, \"one of the most\r\ninteresting scenes in Europe. See the effect of revolutionary\r\ncommotions! While you view the sable spirit of the last monarch of\r\nFrance gliding along, at a distance, with an air of sorrow and\r\nindignation; while you observe a long line of legitimate princes,\r\nexiled from their native country, and dependant upon the contributions\r\nof other powers; mark the wonderful, the unparalleled reverse of human\r\nevents! and acknowledge that the preservation of the finest specimens\r\nof art, the acquisition of every thing which can administer to the\r\nwants of luxury, or decorate the splendour of a throne--the\r\nacclamations of hired multitudes or bribed senates--can reflect little\r\nlustre on THAT CHARACTER which still revels in the frantic wish of\r\nenslaving the world! It is true, you see yonder, Vienna, Petersburg,\r\nStockholm, and Berlin, bereft of their ancient splendour, and bowing,\r\nas it were, at the feet of a despot--but had these latter countries\r\nkept alive one spark of that patriotism which so much endears to us\r\nthe memories of Greece and Rome--had they not, in a great measure,\r\nbecome disunited by factions, we might, even in these days, however\r\ndegenerate, have witnessed something like that national energy which\r\nwas displayed in the bay of Salamis, and on the plains of Marathon.\"\r\n\r\nMy Guide perceiving me to be quite dejected during these remarks,\r\ndirected my attention to another part of the Mirror, which reflected\r\nthe transactions of the _Western_ and _Eastern_ world.\r\n\r\nAt first, a kind of _mist_ spread itself upon the glass, and prevented\r\nme from distinguishing any object. This, however, gradually dissolved,\r\nand was succeeded by a thick, black smoke, which involved every thing\r\nin impenetrable obscurity. Just as I was about to turn to my guide,\r\nand demand the explanation of these appearances, the smoke rolled\r\naway, and instantaneously, there flashed forth a thousand bickering\r\nflames. \"What,\" cried I, \"is the meaning of these objects?\" \"Check,\r\nfor one moment, your impatience, and your curiosity shall be\r\ngratified,\" replied my guide. I then distinctly viewed thousands of\r\n_Black Men_, who had been groaning under the rod of oppression,\r\nstarting up in all the transport of renovated life, and shouting aloud\r\n\"WE ARE FREE!\" One tall commanding figure, who seemed to exercise the\r\nrights of a chieftain among them, gathered many tribes around him, and\r\naddressed them in the following few, but comprehensive, words:\r\n\"Countrymen, it has pleased the Great God above to make man\r\ninstrumental to the freedom of his fellow-creatures. While we lament\r\nour past, let us be grateful for our present, state: and never let us\r\ncease, each revolving year, to build an altar of stones to the memory,\r\nof that GREAT and GOOD MAN, who hath principally been the means of our\r\nFREEDOM FROM SLAVERY. No: we will regularly perform this solemn act,\r\nas long as there shall remain one pebble upon our shores.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thus much,\" resumed my Guide, \"for the dawning felicities of the\r\n_western_ world: but see how the _eastern_ empires are yet ignorant\r\nand unsettled!\" I was about to turn my eyes to Persia and India, to\r\nChina and Japan, when to my astonishment, the surface of the Mirror\r\nbecame perfectly blackened, except in some few circular parts, which\r\nwere tinged with the colour of blood. \"The future is a fearful sight,\"\r\nsaid my Guide; \"we are forbidden its contemplation, and can only\r\nbehold the gloomy appearances before us: they are ominous ones!\"\r\n\r\nMy mind, on which so many and such various objects had produced a\r\nconfused effect, was quite overpowered and distracted. I leaned upon\r\nthe arm of the chair, and, covering my face with my hands, became\r\nabsorbed in a thousand ideas, when a sudden burst of thunder made me\r\nstart from my seat--and, looking forward, I perceived that the MIRROR,\r\nwith all its magical illusions had vanished away! My preternatural\r\nGuide then placed himself before me, but in an altered female form. A\r\nhundred various coloured wings sprung from her arms, and her feet\r\nseemed to be shod with sandals of rubies; around which numerous\r\ncherubs entwined themselves. The perfume that arose from the flapping\r\nof her wings was inexpressibly grateful; and the soft silvery voices\r\nof these cherubic attendants had an effect truly enchanting.\r\n\r\nNo language can adequately describe my sensations on viewing this\r\nextraordinary change of object. I gazed with rapture upon my wonderful\r\nGuide, whose countenance now beamed with benevolence and beauty. \"Ah!\"\r\nexclaimed I, \"this is a vision of happiness never to be realized! Thou\r\nart a being that I am doomed never to meet with in the world below.\"\r\n\"Peace:\" whispered an unknown voice; \"injure not thy species by such a\r\nremark: the object before thee is called by a name that is familiar to\r\nthee--it is 'CANDOUR.' She is the handmaid of Truth, the sister of\r\nVirtue, and the priestess of Religion.\"\r\n\r\nI was about to make reply, when a figure of terrific mien, and\r\nenormous dimensions, rushed angrily towards me, and, taking me up in\r\nmy crystal chair, bore me precipitately to the earth. In my struggles\r\nto disengage myself, I awoke: and on looking about me, with\r\ndifficulty could persuade myself that I was an inhabitant of this\r\nworld. My sensations were, at first, confused and unpleasant; but a\r\nreflection on the MIRROR OF TRUTH, and its divine expositor, in a\r\nmoment tranquillized my feelings. And thus have I told you my dream.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLysander had hardly concluded the recital of his dream--during which\r\nit was impossible for us to think of quaffing coffee or devouring\r\nmuffins--when the servant entered with a note from Lorenzo:\r\n\r\n\"My dear Friend,\r\n\r\n\"The morning is propitious. Hasten to THE ALCOVE. My sisters are\r\ntwining honey-suckles and jessamine round the portico, and I have\r\ncarried thither a respectable corps of bibliographical volumes, for\r\nLysander to consult, in case his memory should fail. All here invoke\r\nthe zephyrs to waft their best wishes to you.\r\n\r\n\"Truly your's,\r\n\r\n\"LORENZO.\"\r\n\r\nThe note was no sooner read than we all, as if by instinct, started\r\nup; and, finishing our breakfast as rapidly as did the Trojans when\r\nthey expected an early visit from the Grecians, we sallied towards\r\nLorenzo's house, and entered his pleasure grounds. Nothing could be\r\nmore congenial than every circumstance and object which presented\r\nitself. The day was clear, calm, and warm; while a crisp autumnal air\r\n\r\n     Nimbly and sweetly recommend itself\r\n     Unto our gentle senses.[423]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 423: _Macbeth_; Act I., Sc. VI. Dr. Johnson has\r\n     happily observed, upon the above beautiful passage of\r\n     Shakespeare, that \"_Gentle sense_ is very elegant; as it\r\n     means _placid_, _calm_, _composed_; and intimates the\r\n     peaceable delight of a fine day.\" Shakespeare's Works; edit.\r\n     1803; vol x., p. 73. Alain Chartier, in the motto prefixed\r\n     to the Second part of this Bibliographical Romance, has\r\n     given us a yet more animated, and equally characteristic,\r\n     picture. Thomson's serene morning,\r\n\r\n          Unfolding fair the last autumnal day,\r\n\r\n     is also very apposite; and reminds us of one of those soft\r\n     and aërial pictures of Claude Loraine, where a heaven-like\r\n     tranquillity and peace seem to prevail. Delightful\r\n     scenes!--we love to steal a short moment from a bustling\r\n     world, to gaze upon landscapes which appear to have been\r\n     copied from the paradise of our first parents. Delusive yet\r\n     fascinating objects of contemplation! You whisper sweet\r\n     repose, and heart-soothing delight! We turn back upon the\r\n     world; and the stunning noises of Virgil's Cyclops put all\r\n     this fair Elysium to flight.]\r\n\r\nAt a distance, the reapers were carrying away their last harvest load;\r\nand numerous groups of gleaners picking up the grain which they had\r\nspared, were marching homewards in all the glee of apparent happiness.\r\nImmediately on our left, the cattle were grazing in a rich pasture\r\nmeadow; while, before us, the white pheasant darted across the walk,\r\nand the stock-dove was heard to wail in the grove. We passed a row of\r\norange trees, glittering with golden fruit; and, turning sharply to\r\nour right, discovered, on a gentle eminence, and skirted with a\r\nprofusion of shrubs and delicately shaped trees, the wished-for\r\nALCOVE.\r\n\r\nWe quickly descried Almansa busied in twining her favourite\r\nhoney-suckles round the portico; while within Belinda was sitting\r\nsoberly at work, as if waiting our arrival. The ladies saluted us as\r\nwe approached; and Lorenzo, who till now had been unperceived, came\r\nquietly from the interior, with his favourite edition of\r\n_Thomson_[424] in his hand.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 424: This must be a favourite edition with every\r\n     man of taste. It was printed by BENSLEY, and published by DU\r\n     ROVERAY, in the year 1802. The designs were by Hamilton, and\r\n     the engravings principally by Fittler. The copy which\r\n     Lorenzo had in his hand was upon _large paper_; and nothing\r\n     could exceed the lustre of the type and plates. The editions\r\n     of _Pope_, _Gray_, and _Milton_, by DU ROVERAY, as well as\r\n     those of _The Spectator_, _Guardian_, _Tatler_, by Messrs.\r\n     SHARPE and HAILES, are among the most elegant, as well as\r\n     accurate, publications of our old popular writers.]\r\n\r\nThe Alcove at a distance, had the appearance of a rustic temple.[425]\r\nThe form, though a little capricious, was picturesque; and it stood\r\nso completely embosomed in rich and variegated foliage, and commanded\r\nso fine a swell of landscape, that the visitor must be cold indeed who\r\ncould approach it with the compass of Palladio in one hand, and the\r\nsquare of Inigo Jones in the other. We entered and looked around us.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 425: Lorenzo was not unmindful that it had been\r\n     observed by Lipsius (_Syntag. de Bibliothecis_) and, after\r\n     him, by Thomasinus (_de Donar. et Tabell-votiv._ c. 3. p.\r\n     37.) that the ancients generally built their libraries near\r\n     to, or adjoining their _Temples_; \"ut veram seram sedem\r\n     sacratorum ingenii fætuum loca sacra esse ostenderent:\"\r\n     BIBLIOTHECAS (inquit) procul abesse (sc. a TEMPLIS)\r\n     noluerunt veteres, ut ex præclaris ingeniorum monumentis\r\n     dependens mortalium, gloria, in Deorum tutela esset. This I\r\n     gather from Spizolius's _Infelix Literatus_: p. 462.]\r\n\r\nThose who have relished the mild beauties of Wynants' pictures would\r\nbe pleased with the view from the Alcove of Lorenzo. The country\r\nbefore was varied, undulating, and the greater part, highly\r\ncultivated. Some broad-spreading oaks here and there threw their\r\nprotecting arms round the humble saplings; and some aspiring elms\r\nfrequently reared their lofty heads, as land-marks across the county.\r\nThe copses skirted the higher grounds, and a fine park-wood covered\r\nthe middle part of the landscape in one broad umbrageous tone of\r\ncolouring. It was not the close rusticity of Hobbima--or the\r\nexpansive, and sometimes complicated, scenery of Berghem--or the\r\nheat-oppressive and magnificent views of Both--that we contemplated;\r\nbut, as has been before observed, the mild and gentle scenery of\r\nWynants; and if a cascade or dimpling brook had been near us, I could\r\nhave called to my aid the transparent pencil of Rysdael, in order to\r\nimpress upon the reader a proper notion of the scenery. But it is high\r\ntime to make mention of the conversation which ensued among the\r\ntenants of this Alcove.\r\n\r\nLOREN. I am heartily glad we are met under such propitious\r\ncircumstances. What a glorious day!\r\n\r\nALMAN. Have you recovered, Sir, the immense fatigue you must have\r\nsustained from the exertions of yesterday? My brother has no mercy\r\nupon a thoroughly-versed book guest!\r\n\r\nLYSAND. I am indeed quite hearty: yet, if any thing heavy and\r\nindigested hung about me, would not the contemplation of such a\r\nlandscape, and such a day, restore every thing to its wonted ardour?!\r\nYou cannot conceive how such a scene affects me: even to shedding\r\ntears of pleasure--from the reflections to which it gives rise.\r\n\r\nBELIN. How strangely and how cruelly has the character of a\r\nbibliographer been aspersed! Last night you convinced me of the ardour\r\nof your enthusiasm, and of the eloquence of your expression, in regard\r\nto your favourite subject of discussion!--but, this morning, I find\r\nthat you can talk in an equally impassioned manner respecting garden\r\nand woodland scenery?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Yes, Madam: and if I possessed such a domain as does your\r\nbrother, I think I could even improve it a little--especially the\r\ninterior of the Alcove! I don't know that I could attach to the house\r\na more appropriate library than he has done; even if I adopted the\r\noctagonal form of the _Hafod Library_;[426] which, considered with\r\nreference to its local situation, is, I think, almost unequalled:--but\r\nit strikes me that the interior of this Alcove might be somewhat\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 426: Hafod, in Cardiganshire, South Wales, is the\r\n     residence of THOMAS JOHNES, Esq., M.P., and Lord Lieutenant\r\n     of the county. Mr. Malkin, in his _Scenery, Antiquities, and\r\n     Biography, of South Wales_, 1804, 4to., and Dr. Smith, in\r\n     his _Tour to Hafod_, 1810, folio, have made us pretty well\r\n     acquainted with the local scenery of Hafod:--yet can any pen\r\n     or pencil do this\r\n\r\n          --Paradise, open'd in the wild,\r\n\r\n     perfect justice! I have seen Mr. Stothard's numerous little\r\n     sketches of the pleasure-grounds and surrounding country,\r\n     which are at once faithful and picturesque. But what were\r\n     this \"Paridise\" of rocks, waterfalls, streams, woods,\r\n     copses, dells, grottos, and mountains, without the\r\n     hospitable spirit of the owner--which seems to preside in,\r\n     and to animate, every summer-house and alcove. The\r\n     book-loving world is well acquainted with the _Chronicles of\r\n     Froissart_, _Joinville_, _De Brocquiere_, and _Monstrelet_,\r\n     which have issued from the HAFOD PRESS; and have long\r\n     deplored the loss, from fire, which their author, Mr.\r\n     Johnes, experienced in the demolition of the greater part of\r\n     his house and library. The former has been rebuilt, and the\r\n     latter replenished: yet no Phoenix spirit can revivify the\r\n     ashes of those volumes which contained the romances notified\r\n     by the renowned Don Quixote! But I am rambling too wildly\r\n     among the Hafod rocks--I hasten, therefore to return and\r\n     take the reader with me into the interior of Mr. Johnes's\r\n     largest library, which is terminated by a Conservatory of\r\n     upwards of 150 feet. As the ancient little books for\r\n     children [hight _Lac Puerorum_!] used to express it--\"Look,\r\n     here it is.\"\r\n\r\n     [Illustration]]\r\n\r\nLOREN. What defects do you discover here, Lysander?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. They are rather omissions to be supplied than errors to be\r\ncorrected. You have warmed the interior by a Grecian-shaped stove, and\r\nyou do right; but I think a few small busts in yonder recesses would\r\nnot be out of character. Milton, Shakespeare, and Locke, would\r\nproduce a sort of inspiration which might accord with that degree of\r\nfeeling excited by the contemplation of these external objects.\r\n\r\nLOREN. You are right. 'Ere you revisit this spot, those inspiring\r\ngentlemen shall surround me.\r\n\r\nBELIN. And pray add to them the busts of Thomson and Cowper: for these\r\nlatter, in my opinion, are our best poets in the description of rural\r\nlife. You remember what Cowper says--\r\n\r\n     God made the country, and Man made the town?\r\n\r\nALMAN. This may be very well--but we forget the purpose for which we\r\nare convened.\r\n\r\nLIS. True: so I entreat you, Master Lysander, to open--not the\r\ndebate--but the discussion.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. You wish to know what are the SYMPTOMS OF THE\r\nBIBLIOMANIA?--what are the badges or livery marks, in a library, of\r\nthe owner of the collection being a bibliomaniac?\r\n\r\nALMAN. Even so. My question, yesterday evening, was--if I remember\r\nwell--whether a _mere collector_ of books was necessarily a\r\nbibliomaniac?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Yes: and to which--if I also recollect rightly--I replied that\r\nthe symptoms of the disease, and the character of a bibliomaniac, were\r\ndiscoverable in the very books themselves!\r\n\r\nLIS. How is this?\r\n\r\nALMAN & BELIN. Do pray let us hear.\r\n\r\nPHIL. At the outset, I entreat you, Lysander, not to overcharge the\r\ncolouring of your picture. Respect the character of your auditors;\r\nand, above all things, have mercy upon the phlogistic imagination of\r\nLisardo!\r\n\r\nLYSAND. I will endeavour to discharge the important office of a\r\nbibliomaniacal Mentor, or, perhaps, Æsculapius, to the utmost of my\r\npower: and at all events, with the best possible intentions.\r\n\r\nBefore we touch upon the _Symptoms_, it may be as well to say a few\r\nwords respecting the _General Character_ of the BOOK DISEASE. The\r\ningenious Peignot[427] defines the bibliomania to be \"a passion for\r\npossessing books; not so much to be instructed by them, as to gratify\r\nthe eye by looking on them.\" This subject has amused the pens of\r\nforeigners; although we have had nothing in our own language, written\r\nexpressly upon it, 'till the ingenious and elegantly-composed poem of\r\nDr. Ferriar appeared; after which, as you well know, our friend put\r\nforth his whimsical brochure.[428]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 427: \"LA BIRLIOMANIE [Transcriber's Note:\r\n     BIBLIOMANIE] est la fureur de posséder des livres, non pas\r\n     tant pour s'instruire, que pour les avoir et pour en\r\n     repaître sa vue. Le bibliomane ne connait ordinairement les\r\n     livres que par leur titre, leur frontispice, et leur date;\r\n     il s'attache aux bonnes editiones et les poursuit à quelque\r\n     titre que ce soit; la relieure le seduit aussi, soit par son\r\n     ancienneté, soit par sa beauté,\" &c. _Dictionnaire de\r\n     Bibliologie_. vol. i. p. 51. This is sufficiently severe:\r\n     see also the extracts from the _Memoires de l'Institut_: p.\r\n     25, ante. The more ancient foreign writers have not scrupled\r\n     to call the BIBLIOMANIA by every caustic and merciless\r\n     terms: thus speaks the hard-hearted Geyler: \"Tertia nola\r\n     est, multos libros coacervare propter animi voluptatem\r\n     curiosam. Fastidientis stomachi est multa degustare, ait\r\n     Seneca. Isti per multos libros vagant legentes assidue:\r\n     nimirum similles fatuis illis, qui in urbe cicumeunt domos\r\n     singulas, et earum picturas dissutis malis contuentur:\r\n     sicque curiositate trahuntur, &c. Contenti in hâc animi\r\n     voluptate, quam pascunt per volumina varia devagando et\r\n     liguriendo. Itaque gaudent hic de larga librorum copia,\r\n     operosa utique sed delectabilis sarcina, et animi jucunda\r\n     distractio: imo est hæc ingens librorum copia ingens simul\r\n     et laboris copia, et quietis inopia--huc illucque circum\r\n     agendum ingenium: his atque illis pregravanda\r\n     memoria.\"--_Navicula sive Sæculum Fatuorum_, 1511, 4to. sign\r\n     B. iiij rev. Thus speaks Sebastian Brandt upon the subject,\r\n     through the medium of our old translation:\r\n\r\n          Styll am I besy bokes assemblynge\r\n          For to have plenty it is a pleasaunte thynge\r\n          In my conceyt, and to have them ay in honde;\r\n          But what they mene do I nat understonde.\r\n\r\n          _Shyp of Folys_: see p. 206, ante.\r\n\r\n     There is a short, but smart and interesting, article on this\r\n     head in Mr. D'Israeli's _Curiosities of Literature_: vol. i.\r\n     10. \"Bruyere has touched on this mania with humour; of such\r\n     a collector (one who is fond of superb bindings only), says\r\n     he, as soon as I enter his house, I am ready to faint on the\r\n     stair-case from a strong smell of Russia and Morocco\r\n     leather. In vain he shews me fine editions, gold leaves,\r\n     Etruscan bindings, &c.--naming them one after another, as if\r\n     he were shewing a gallery of pictures!\" Lucian has composed\r\n     a biting invective against an ignorant possessor of a vast\r\n     library. \"One who opens his eyes with an hideous stare at an\r\n     old book; and after turning over the pages, chiefly admires\r\n     _the date_ of its publication.\" But all this, it may be\r\n     said, is only general declamation, and means nothing!]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 428: The first work, I believe, written expressly\r\n     upon the subject above discussed was a French publication,\r\n     entitled _La Bibliomanie_. Of the earliest edition I am\r\n     uninformed; but one was published at the Hague in 1762, 8vo.\r\n     Dr. Ferriar's poem upon the subject, being an epistle to\r\n     Richard Heber, Esq.--and which is rightly called by Lysander\r\n     'ingenious and elegant'--was published in 1809, 4to.: pp.\r\n     14: but not before an equally ingenious, and greatly more\r\n     interesting, performance, by the same able pen, had appeared\r\n     in the Trans. of the Manchester Literary Society, vol. iv.,\r\n     p. 45-87--entitled _Comments upon Sterne_; which may be\r\n     fairly classed among the species of bibliomaniacal\r\n     composition; inasmuch as it shews the author to be well read\r\n     in old books; and, of these, in Burton's Anatomy of\r\n     Melancholy in particular. Look for half a minute at p. 286,\r\n     ante. In the same year of Dr. Ferriar's publication of the\r\n     Bibliomania, appeared the _Voyage autour de ma bibliothèque\r\n     Roman Bibliographique_: by Ant. Caillot; in three small\r\n     duodecimo volumes. There is little ingenuity and less\r\n     knowledge in these meagre volumes. My own superficial work,\r\n     entitled, _Bibliomania_, or _Book-Madness: containing some\r\n     account of the History, Symptoms and Cure of this fatal\r\n     Disease; in an epistle addressed to Richard Heber, Esq._,\r\n     quickly followed Dr. Ferriar's publication. It contained 82\r\n     pages, with a tolerably copious sprinkling of notes: but it\r\n     had many errors and omissions, which it has been my\r\n     endeavour to correct and supply in the present new edition,\r\n     or rather newly-constructed work. Vide preface. Early in the\r\n     ensuing year (namely, in 1810) appeared _Bibliosophia, or\r\n     Book-Wisdom: containing some account of the Pride, Pleasure,\r\n     and Privileges of that glorious Vocation, Book-Collecting.\r\n     By an Aspirant. Also, The Twelve Labours of an Editor,\r\n     separately pitted against those of Hercules_, 12mo. This is\r\n     a good-humoured and tersely written composition: being a\r\n     sort of Commentary upon my own performance. In the ensuing\r\n     pages will be found some amusing poetical extracts from it.\r\n     And thus take we leave of PUBLICATIONS UPON THE\r\n     BIBLIOMANIA!]\r\n\r\nWhether Peignot's definition be just or not, I will not stop to\r\ndetermine: but when I have described to you the various symptoms, you\r\nwill be better able to judge of its propriety.\r\n\r\nLIS. Describe them _seriatim_, as we were observing yesterday.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. I will; but let me put them in battle array, and select them\r\naccording to their appearances. There is, first, a passion for _Large\r\nPaper Copies_; secondly, for _Uncut Copies_; thirdly, for _Illustrated\r\nCopies_; fourthly, for _Unique Copies_; fifthly, for _Copies printed\r\nupon Vellum_; sixthly, for _First Editions_; seventhly, for _True\r\nEditions_; and eighthly, for _Books printed in the Black-Letter_.\r\n\r\nBELIN. I have put these symptoms down in my pocket-book; and shall\r\nproceed to catechise you according to your own method. First,\r\ntherefore, what is meant by LARGE PAPER COPIES?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. A certain set, or limited number of the work, is printed upon\r\npaper of a _larger dimension, and superior quality_, than the ordinary\r\ncopies. The press-work and ink are, always, proportionably better in\r\nthese copies: and the price of them is enhanced according to their\r\nbeauty and rarity.\r\n\r\n_This Symptom_ of the Bibliomania is, at the present day, both general\r\nand violent. Indeed, there is a set of collectors, the shelves of\r\nwhose libraries are always made proportionably stout, and placed at a\r\ndue distance from each other, in order that they may not break down\r\nbeneath the weight of such ponderous volumes.\r\n\r\nBELIN. Can these things be?\r\n\r\nPHIL. Yes; but you should draw a distinction, and not confound the\r\nGROLLIERS, De Thous, and Colberts of modern times, with \"a set of\r\ncollectors,\" as you call them, who are equally without taste and\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nLIS. We have heard of De Thou and Colbert, but who is GROLLIER?[429]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 429: The reader may be better pleased with the\r\n     ensuing soberly-written account of this great man than with\r\n     Philemon's rapturous eulogy. JOHN GROLLIER was born at\r\n     Lyons, in 1479; and very early displayed a propensity\r\n     towards those elegant and solid pursuits which afterwards\r\n     secured to him the admiration and esteem of his\r\n     contemporaries. His address was easy, his manners were\r\n     frank, yet polished; his demeanour was engaging, and his\r\n     liberality knew no bounds. As he advanced in years, he\r\n     advanced in reputation; enjoying a princely fortune, the\r\n     result, in some measure, of a faithful and honourable\r\n     discharge of the important diplomatic situations which he\r\n     filled. He was Grand Treasurer to Francis I., and was sent\r\n     by that monarch as ambassador to Pope Clement VII. During\r\n     his abode at Rome, he did not fail to gratify his favourite\r\n     passion of BOOK-COLLECTING; and employed the Alduses to\r\n     print for him an edition of Terence in 8vo., 1521: of which\r\n     a copy _upon vellum_, was in the Imperial library at Vienna;\r\n     See _L'Imp. des Alde_; vol. I., 159. He also caused to be\r\n     published, by the same printers, an edition of his friend\r\n     Budæus's work, _De Asse et partibus ejus_, 1522, 4to.;\r\n     which, as well as the Terence, is dedicated to himself, and\r\n     of which the presentation copy, _upon vellum_, is now in the\r\n     Library of Count M'Carthy, at Toulouse: it having been\r\n     formerly in the Soubise collection: vide p. 96, ante--and\r\n     no. 8010 of the _Bibl. Soubise_. It was during Grollier's\r\n     stay at Rome, that the anecdote, related by Egnatio, took\r\n     place. 'I dined (says the latter) along with Aldus, his son,\r\n     Manutius, and other learned men, at Grollier's table. After\r\n     dinner, and just as the dessert had been placed on the\r\n     table, our host presented each of his guests with a pair of\r\n     gloves filled with ducats.' But no man had a higher opinion\r\n     of Grollier, or had reason to express himself in more\r\n     grateful terms of him, than De Thou. This illustrious author\r\n     speaks of him as \"a man of equal elegance of manners, and\r\n     spotlessness of character. His books seemed to be the\r\n     counterpart of himself, for neatness and splendour; not\r\n     being inferior to the glory attributed to the library of\r\n     Asinius Pollio, the first who made a collection of books at\r\n     Rome. It is surprising, notwithstanding the number of\r\n     presents which he made to his friends, and the accidents\r\n     which followed on the dispersion of his library, how many of\r\n     his volumes yet adorn the most distinguished libraries of\r\n     Paris, whose chief boast consists in having an _Exemplar\r\n     Grollerianum_!\" The fact was Grollier returned to Paris with\r\n     an immense fortune. During his travels he had secured, from\r\n     Basil, Venice, and Rome, the most precious copies of books\r\n     which could be purchased: and which he took care to have\r\n     bound in a singular manner, indicative at once of his\r\n     generosity and taste. The title of the book was marked in\r\n     gilt letters upon one side, and the words--of which the\r\n     annexed wood-cut is a fac-simile--upon the other; surrounded\r\n     with similar ornaments to the extremities of the sides,\r\n     whether in folio or duodecimo.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration:\r\n\r\n     PORTIO MEA DO\r\n     MINE SIT IN\r\n     TERRA VI\r\n     VENTI\r\n     VM.\r\n\r\n     Beneath the title of the book: 'IO: GROLLERII et AMICORUM.']\r\n\r\n     This extraordinary man, whom France may consider the first\r\n     Bibliomaniac of the sixteenth century, died at Paris in the\r\n     year 1565, and in the 86th of his age. Let us close this\r\n     account of him with an extract from Marville's _Melanges\r\n     d'Histoire et de Litérature_; \"La Bibliothèque de M.\r\n     Grollier s'est conservée dans l'Hôtel de Vic jusqu'à ces\r\n     annêes dernieres qu'elle a été venduë à l'encan.

La plûpart des curieux de Paris\r\n     ont profité de ses débris. J'en ai eu à ma part quelques\r\n     volumes à qui rien ne manque: ni pour la bonté des editions\r\n     de ce tems là, ni pour la beauté du papier et la propreté de\r\n     la relieure. Il semble, à les voir, que les Muses qui ont\r\n     contribué à la composition du dedans, se soient aussi\r\n     appliquées à les approprier au dehors, tant il paroît d'art\r\n     et d'esprit dans leurs ornemens.

Then follows a description, of which\r\n     the reader has just had ocular demonstration. After such an\r\n     account, what bibliomaniac can enjoy perfect tranquillity of\r\n     mind unless he possess a _Grollier copy_ of some work or\r\n     other? My own, from which the preceding fac-simile was\r\n     taken, is a folio edition (1531) of _Rhenanus, de rebus\r\n     Germanicis_; in the finest preservation.]\r\n\r\nPHIL. Lysander will best observe upon him.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Nay; his character cannot be in better hands.\r\n\r\nPHIL. Grollier was both the friend and the treasurer of Francis the\r\nFirst; the bosom companion of De Thou, and a patron of the Aldine\r\nfamily. He had learning, industry, and inflexible integrity. His\r\nnotions of _Virtû_ were vast, but not wild. There was a magnificence\r\nabout every thing which he did or projected; and his liberality was\r\nwithout bounds. He was the unrivalled Mecænas of book-lovers and\r\nscholars; and a more insatiable bibliomaniacal appetite was never,\r\nperhaps, possessed by any of _his_ class of character.\r\n\r\nLIS. I thank you for this _Grollieriana_. Proceed, Lysander with your\r\nlarge paper copies.\r\n\r\nALMAN. But first tell us--why are these copies so much coveted? Do\r\nthey contain more than the ordinary ones?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Not in the least. Sometimes, however, an extra embellishment\r\nis thrown into the volume--but this, again, belongs to the fourth\r\nclass of symptoms, called _Unique Copies_--and I must keep strictly to\r\norder; otherwise I shall make sad confusion.\r\n\r\nBELIN. Keep to your large paper, exclusively.[430]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 430: Let us first hear Dr. Ferriar's smooth\r\n     numbers upon this tremendous symptom of the Bibliomania:\r\n\r\n          But devious oft, from ev'ry classic Muse,\r\n          The keen collector meaner paths will choose:\r\n          And first the MARGIN'S BREADTH his soul employs,\r\n          Pure, snowy, broad, the type of nobler joys.\r\n          In vain might Homer roll the tide of song,\r\n          Or Horace smile, or Tully charm the throng;\r\n          If crost by Pallas' ire, the trenchant blade\r\n          Or too oblique, or near, the edge invade,\r\n          The Bibliomane exclaims, with haggard eye,\r\n          'NO MARGIN!'--turns in haste, and scorns to buy.\r\n\r\n          _The Bibliomania_; v. 34-43.\r\n\r\n     Next come the rivals strains of 'An Aspirant.'\r\n\r\n          FIRST MAXIM.\r\n\r\n          Who slaves the monkish folio through,\r\n          With lore or science in his view,\r\n          _Him_ ... visions black, or devils blue,\r\n            Shall haunt at his expiring taper;--\r\n          Yet, 'tis a weakness of the wise,\r\n          To chuse the volume by the size,\r\n          And riot in the pond'rous prize--\r\n            Dear Copies--_printed on_ LARGE PAPER!\r\n\r\n          _Bibliosophia_; p. IV.\r\n\r\n     After these saucy attacks, can I venture upon discoursing,\r\n     in a sober note-like strain--upon those large and\r\n     magnificent volumes concerning which Lysander, above, pours\r\n     forth such a torrent of eloquence? Yes--gentle reader--I\r\n     will even venture!--and will lay a silver penny to boot (See\r\n     Peacham's '_Worth of a Penny_'--) that neither Dr. Ferriar\r\n     nor the 'Aspirant' could withhold their ejaculations of\r\n     rapture upon seeing any one of the following volumes walk\r\n     majestically into their libraries. Mark well, therefore, a\r\n     few scarce\r\n\r\n     WORKS PRINTED UPON LARGE PAPER.\r\n\r\n     _Lord Bacon's Essays_; 1798, 8vo. There were only six copies\r\n     of this edition struck off upon royal folio paper: one copy\r\n     is in the Cracherode collection, in the British Museum; and\r\n     another is in the library of Earl Spencer. Mr. Leigh, the\r\n     book-auctioneer, a long time ago observed that, if ever one\r\n     of these copies were to be sold at an auction, it would\r\n     probably bring -00_l._--! I will not insert the _first_\r\n     figure; but _two noughts_ followed it.----_Twenty Plays of\r\n     Shakspeare from the old quarto editions_; 1766, 8vo., 6\r\n     vols. Only twelve copies printed upon large paper. See\r\n     _Bibl. Steevens_: no. 1312; and p. 581,\r\n     ante.----_Dodsley's Collection of Old Plays_; 1780, 8vo., 12\r\n     vols. Only six copies struck off upon large paper. Bibl.\r\n     Woodhouse, no. 698.----_The Grenville Homer_; 1800, 4to.,\r\n     4 vols. Fifty copies of this magnificent work are said to\r\n     have been printed upon large paper; which have\r\n     embellishments of plates. Mr. Dent possesses the copy which\r\n     was Professor Porson's, and which was bought at the sale of\r\n     the Professor's library, in boards, for 87_l._, see p. 459,\r\n     ante. Seven years ago I saw a sumptuous copy in morocco,\r\n     knocked down for 99_l._ 15_s._----_Mathæi Paris, Monachi\r\n     Albanenses, &c.; Historia Major; a Wats_; Lond. 1640; folio.\r\n     This is a rare and magnificent work upon large paper; and is\r\n     usually bound in two volumes.----_Historiæ Anglicanæ\r\n     Scriptores X; a Twysden_; 1652, folio. Of equal rarity and\r\n     magnificence are copies of this inestimable\r\n     production.----_Rerum Anglicarum Scriptores Veteres, a\r\n     Gale_; 1684, 91; folio, 3 volumes. There were but few copies\r\n     of this, now generally coveted, work printed upon large\r\n     paper. The difference between the small and the large, for\r\n     amplitude of margin and lustre of ink, is\r\n     inconceivable.----_Historiæ Anglicanæ Scriptores Varii, a\r\n     Sparke_; Lond. 1723, folio. The preface to this work shews\r\n     that there are copies of it, like those of Dr. Clarke's\r\n     edition of Cæsar's Commentaries, upon paper of three\r\n     different sizes. The 'charta maxima' is worthy of a\r\n     conspicuous place upon the collector's shelf; though in any\r\n     shape the book has a creditable aspect.----_Recueil des\r\n     Historiens des Gaules, &c., par Boucquet_; 1738, 1786;\r\n     folio, 13 vols. It is hardly possible for the eye to gaze\r\n     upon a more intrinsically valuable work, or a finer set of\r\n     volumes, than are these, as now exhibited in Mr. Evans's\r\n     shop, and bound in fine old red morocco by the best binders\r\n     of France. They were once in my possession; but the 'res\r\n     angusta domi' compelled me to part with them, and to seek\r\n     for a copy not so tall by head and shoulders. Since the year\r\n     1786, two additional volumes have been published.\r\n\r\n     We will now discourse somewhat of English books.\r\n\r\n     _Scott's Discoverie of Whitcraft_; 1584, 4to. Of this work,\r\n     which has recently become popular from Mr. Douce's frequent\r\n     mention of it (Illustrations of Shakspeare, &c., 1806, 2\r\n     vols., 8vo.), my friend, Mr. Utterson, possesses a very\r\n     beautiful copy upon large paper. It is rarely one meets with\r\n     books printed in this country, before the year 1600, struck\r\n     off in such a manner. This copy, which is secured from\r\n     'winter and rough weather' by a stout coat of\r\n     skilfully-tool'd morocco, is probably unique.----_Weever's\r\n     Funeral Monuments_; 1631, folio. Mr. Samuel Lysons informs\r\n     me that he has a copy of this work upon large paper. I never\r\n     saw, or heard of, another similar one.----_Sanford's\r\n     Genealogical History_; 1707, folio. At the sale of Baron\r\n     Smyth's books, in 1809, Messrs. J. and A. Arch purchased a\r\n     copy of this work upon large paper for 46_l._ A monstrous\r\n     price! A similar copy is in the library of Mr. Grenville,\r\n     which was obtained from Mr. Evans of Pall-Mall. The curious\r\n     should purchase the anterior edition (of 1677) for the sake\r\n     of better impressions of the plates; which, however, in any\r\n     condition, are neither tasteful nor well engraved. What is\r\n     called '_a good Hollar_' would weigh down the whole set of\r\n     them!----_Strype's Ecclesiastical Memorials_; 1721, _Folio_,\r\n     3 vols.----_Annals of the Reformation_; 1725, _Folio_, 4\r\n     vols. Happy the collector who can regale himself by viewing\r\n     large paper copies of these inestimable works! In any shape\r\n     or condition, they are now rare. The latter is the scarcer\r\n     of the two; and upon large paper brings, what the French\r\n     bibliographers call, 'un prix enorme.' There is one of this\r\n     kind in the beautiful library of Mr. Thomas\r\n     Grenville.----_Hearne's Works_--'till Mr. Bagster issued his\r\n     first reprints of Robert of Gloucester and Peter Langtoft,\r\n     upon paper of three different sizes--(of which the largest,\r\n     in quarto, has hardly been equalled in modern\r\n     printing)--used to bring extravagant sums at book-auctions.\r\n     At a late sale in Pall-Mall, were [Transcriber's Note:\r\n     where] the books in general were sold at extraordinary\r\n     prices, the large paper Hearnes absolutely 'hung fire'--as\r\n     the sportsman's phrase is.----_Hudibras, with Dr. Grey's\r\n     Annotations, and Hogarth's cuts_; 1744, 2 vols. There were\r\n     but twelve copies of this first and best edition of Dr.\r\n     Grey's labours upon Hudibras (which Warburton strangely\r\n     abuses--) printed upon large paper: and a noble book it is\r\n     in this form!----_Milner's History of Winchester_; 1798,\r\n     4to., 2 vols. Of this edition there were, I believe, either\r\n     twelve or twenty-four copies printed upon large paper; which\r\n     brings serious sums in the present general rage for books of\r\n     this description.----_Kennet's (Bp.) Parochial Antiquities;\r\n     Oxford_, 1695, 4to. The only known copy of this work upon\r\n     large paper is in the fine library of Sir Richard Colt\r\n     Hoare, Bart. This copy was probably in the collection of\r\n     'that well-known collector, Joseph Browne, Esq., of Shepton\r\n     Mallet, Somersetshire:' as a similar one 'in Russia, gilt\r\n     leaves,' was sold in Pt. II. of his collection, no. 279,\r\n     for 7_l._ 17_s._ 6_d._ and purchased in the name of\r\n     Thornton.----_The Chronicles of Froissart and Monstrelet_:\r\n     translated by Thomas Johnes, Esq. Hafod, 1803, 1810, quarto,\r\n     9 vols.: including a volume of plates to Monstrelet. Of\r\n     these beautiful and intrinsically valuable works, there were\r\n     only 25 copies struck off upon folio; which bring tremendous\r\n     prices.----_History of the Town of Cheltenham, and its\r\n     Environs_; 1802, 8vo. There were a few copies of this\r\n     superficial work printed upon large paper in royal octavo,\r\n     and a _unique_ copy upon paper of a quarto size; which\r\n     latter is in the possession of my friend Mr. Thomas Pruen,\r\n     of the same place. A part of this volume was written by\r\n     myself; according to instructions which I received to make\r\n     it 'light and pleasant.' An author, like a barrister, is\r\n     bound in most cases to follow his instructions! As I have\r\n     thus awkwardly introduced myself, I may be permitted to\r\n     observe, at the foot of this note, that all the LARGE PAPER\r\n     copies of my own humble lucubrations have been attended with\r\n     an unexpectedly successful sale. Of the _Introduction to the\r\n     Classics_, edit. 1804, 8vo., there were fifty copies, with\r\n     extra plates, struck off in royal octavo, and published at\r\n     2_l._ 2_s._: these now sell for 5_l._ 5_s._: the portrait of\r\n     _Bishop Fell_ making them snapped at, with a perch-like\r\n     spirit, by all true Grangerites. Of the _Typographical\r\n     Antiquities_ of our own country there were 66 printed in a\r\n     superb style, upon imperial paper, in 4to.; these were\r\n     published at 6_l._ 6_s._ a copy. The following anecdote\r\n     shews how they are 'looking up'--as the book-market phrase\r\n     is. My friend ---- parted with his copy; but finding that his\r\n     slumbers were broken, and his dreams frightful, in\r\n     consequence, he sought to regain possession of it; and\r\n     cheerfully gave 10_l._ 10_s._! for what, but a few months\r\n     before, he had possessed for little more than one half the\r\n     sum! The same friend subscribes for a _large paper_ of the\r\n     _present work_, of which there are only eighteen copies\r\n     printed: and of which my hard-hearted printer and myself\r\n     seize each upon a copy. Will the same friend display equal\r\n     fickleness in regard to THIS volume? If he does, he must\r\n     smart acutely for it: nor will 15_l._ 15_s._ redeem it! It\r\n     is justly observed, in the first edition of this work, that,\r\n     'analogous to large paper, are TALL copies: that is, copies\r\n     of the work published on the ordinary size paper, and barely\r\n     cut down by the binder,' p. 45. To _dwarfise_ a volume is a\r\n     'grievous fault' on the part of any binder; but more\r\n     particularly is it an unpardonable one on the part of him\r\n     who has had a long intercourse with professed bibliomaniacs!\r\n     To a person who knows anything of typographical arrangement,\r\n     the distinction between _tall_ and _large paper_ copies is\r\n     sufficiently obvious. For this reason, I am quite decided\r\n     that the supposed large paper copy of _Scapula's Lexicon_,\r\n     possessed by Mr. ----, of Caversham, near Reading, is only a\r\n     _tall_ copy of the work, as usually printed: nor is this\r\n     copy more stately than another which I have seen. The owner\r\n     of the volume will suppress all feelings which he may\r\n     entertain against my heretical opinions (as I fear he will\r\n     call them), when he considers that he may dispose of his\r\n     Scapula for a sum three times beyond what he gave for it.\r\n     Let him put it by the side of his neighbour Dr. Valpy's\r\n     numerous large paper copies of the old folio classics, and\r\n     he will in a moment be convinced of the accuracy of the\r\n     foregoing remark. FINE PAPER copies of a work should be here\r\n     noticed; as they are sought after with avidity. The most\r\n     beautiful work of this kind which I ever saw, was _Rapin's\r\n     History of England, in nine folio volumes, bound in red\r\n     morocco, and illustrated with Houbraken's_ Heads; which Sir\r\n     M.M. Sykes recently purchased of Mr. Evans, the\r\n     bookseller,--for a comparatively moderate sum. A similar\r\n     copy (exclusively of the illustrations) of Rapin's History\r\n     of England, which was once in the library of the Royal\r\n     Institution, was burnt in the fire that destroyed\r\n     Covent-Garden Theatre; it having been sent to Mr. Mackinlay,\r\n     the book-binder, who lived near the Theatre.]\r\n\r\nLYSAND. I have little to add to what has been already said of this\r\nsymptom. That a volume, so published, has a more pleasing aspect,\r\ncannot be denied. It is the oak, in its full growth, compared with\r\nthe same tree in its sapling state: or, if you please, it is the same\r\npicture a little more brilliant in its colouring, and put into a\r\nhandsomer frame. My friend MARCUS is a very dragon in this department\r\nof book-collecting: nothing being too formidable for his attack. Let\r\nthe volume assume what shape it may, and let the price be ever so\r\nunconscionable--he hesitates not to become a purchaser. In\r\nconsequence, exclusively of all the _Dugdales_ and _Montfaucons_, upon\r\nlarge paper, and in the finest bindings, he possesses the _Grand Folio\r\nClassics_, the _Benedictine Editions of the Fathers_, the _County\r\nHistories_, and all works, of a recent date, upon _History_ and the\r\n_Belles Lettres_. In short, nothing can be more magnificent than the\r\ninterior of his library; as nothing but giants, arrayed in the most\r\nsplendid attire, are seen to keep guard from one extremity of the room\r\nto the other.\r\n\r\nLIS. Who is this Marcus? I'll rival him in due time!--But proceed.\r\n\r\nBELIN. Thus much, I presume, for the first symptom of the Bibliomania.\r\nNow pray, Sir, inform us what is meant by that strange term, UNCUT\r\nCOPIES?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Of all the symptoms of the Bibliomania, this is probably the\r\nmost extraordinary.[431] It may be defined a passion to possess books\r\nof which the edges have never been sheared by the binder's tools. And\r\nhere I find myself walking upon doubtful ground:--your friend [turning\r\ntowards me] Atticus's _uncut Hearnes_ rise up in \"rough majesty\"\r\nbefore me, and almost \"push me from my stool.\" Indeed, when I look\r\naround in your book-lined tub, I cannot but acknowledge that this\r\nsymptom of the disorder has reached your own threshold; but when it is\r\nknown that a few of your bibliographical books are left with the edges\r\nuncut _merely to please your friends_ (as one must sometimes study\r\ntheir tastes as well as one's own), I trust that no very serious\r\nconclusions will be drawn about the fatality of your own case.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 431: As before, let us borrow the strains of 'An\r\n     Aspirant:'\r\n\r\n          SECOND MAXIM.\r\n\r\n          Who, with fantastic pruning-hook,\r\n          Dresses the borders of his book,\r\n          Merely to ornament its look--\r\n            Amongst philosophers a fop is:\r\n          What if, perchance, he thence discover\r\n          Facilities in turning over?\r\n          The Virtuoso is a Lover\r\n            Of coyer charms in \"UNCUT COPIES.\"\r\n\r\n          _Bibliosophia_; p. v.\r\n\r\n     I have very little to add in illustration of Lysander's\r\n     well-pointed sarcasms relating to this _second symptom of_\r\n     BOOK-MADNESS. I think I once heard of an uncut _Cranmer's\r\n     Bible_; but have actually seen a similar conditioned copy of\r\n     _Purchas's Pilgrimes and Pilgrimage_, which is now in the\r\n     beautiful library of the Honourable T. Grenville.]\r\n\r\nAs to uncut copies, although their inconvenience [an uncut Lexicon to\r\nwit!] and deformity must be acknowledged, and although a rational man\r\ncan wish for nothing better than a book _once well bound_, yet we find\r\nthat the extraordinary passion for collecting them not only obtains\r\nwith full force, but is attended with very serious consequences to\r\nthose \"que n'out point des pistoles\" (to borrow the idea of Clement;\r\nvol. vi. p. 36). I dare say an uncut _first Shakspeare_, as well as an\r\n_uncut vellum Aldus_[432] would produce a little annuity!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 432: I doubt of the existence of an uncut _first\r\n     Shakspeare_; although we have recently had evidence of an\r\n     uncut _first Homer_; for thus speaks Peignot: \"A superb copy\r\n     of this Editio Princeps was sold at the sale of M. de\r\n     Cotte's books, in 1804, for 3601 livres: but it must be\r\n     remarked that this copy was in the most exquisite\r\n     preservation, as if it had just come from the press.\r\n     Moreover, it is probably the only one the margins of which\r\n     have never been either 'shaven or shorn.'\" _Curiosités\r\n     Bibliographiques_, p. lxv. vi.; see also p. 79, ante. Dr.\r\n     Harwood, at page 338, of his _View of the Editions of the\r\n     Classics_, speaks of an uncut vellum Aldus, of 1504, 8vo.\r\n     \"Mr. Quin shewed me a fine copy of it printed in vellum with\r\n     the _leaves uncut_, which he bought of Mr. Egerton at a very\r\n     moderate price. It is, perhaps (adds he), the only _uncut_\r\n     vellum Aldus in the world.\" From the joyous strain of this\r\n     extract, the Doctor may be fairly suspected of having\r\n     strongly exhibited this second symptom of the Bibliomania!]\r\n\r\nBELIN. 'Tis very strange'--as Hamlet says at the walking of his\r\nfather's ghost! But now for your ILLUSTRATED COPIES!\r\n\r\nLYSAND. You have touched a vibrating string indeed!--but I will\r\nsuppress my own feelings, and spare those of my friend. A passion for\r\nbooks _illustrated_, or adorned with _numerous Prints_[433]\r\nrepresenting characters, or circumstances, mentioned in the work, is a\r\nvery general and violent symptom of the Bibliomania. The origin, or\r\nfirst appearance, of this symptom, has been traced by some to the\r\npublication of the Rev. ---- GRANGER'S \"_Biographical History of\r\nEngland_;\" but whoever will be at the pains of reading the preface of\r\nthat work will see that Granger shelters himself under the authorities\r\nof EVELYN, ASHMOLE, and others; and that he _alone_ is not to be\r\nconsidered as responsible for all the mischief which this passion for\r\ncollecting prints has occasioned. Granger, however, was the first who\r\nintroduced it in the form of a history; and surely \"in an evil hour\"\r\nwas that history published; although its amiable author must be\r\nacquitted of \"malice prepense.\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 433: This third symptom has not escaped the\r\n     discerning eye of the Manchester physician; for thus sings\r\n     Dr. Ferriar:\r\n\r\n          He pastes, from injur'd volumes snipt away,\r\n          His _English Heads_ in chronicled array,\r\n          Torn from their destin'd page (unworthy meed\r\n          Of Knightly counsel, and heroic deed),\r\n          Not _Faithorne's_ stroke, nor _Field's_ own types can save\r\n          The gallant Veres, and one-eyed Ogle brave.\r\n          Indignant readers seek the image fled,\r\n          And curse the busy fool who _wants a head_.\r\n            Proudly he shews, with many a smile elate,\r\n          The scrambling subjects of the _private plate_\r\n          While Time their actions and their names bereaves,\r\n          They grin for ever in the guarded leaves.\r\n\r\n          _The Bibliomania_; v. 119-130.\r\n\r\n     These are happy thoughts, happily expressed. In illustration\r\n     of v. 123, the author observes,--\"three fine heads, for the\r\n     sake of which, the beautiful and interesting commentaries of\r\n     Sir Francis Vere have been mutilated by collectors of\r\n     English portraits.\" Dr. Ferriar might have added that, when\r\n     a Grangerian bibliomaniac commences his ILLUSTRATING CAREER,\r\n     he does not fail to make a desperate onset upon _Speed_,\r\n     _Boissard_, and the _Heroologia_. Even the lovely prints of\r\n     _Houbraken_ (in Dr. Birch's account of Illustrious Persons\r\n     of Great Britain) escape not the ravages of his passion for\r\n     illustration. The plates which adorn these books are\r\n     considered among the foundation materials of a Grangerian\r\n     building. But it is time, according to my plan, to introduce\r\n     other sarcastic strains of poetry.\r\n\r\n          THIRD MAXIM.\r\n\r\n          Who, swearing not a line to miss,\r\n          Doats on the leaf his fingers kiss,\r\n          Thanking the _words_ for all his bliss,--\r\n            Shall rue, at last, his passion frustrate:\r\n          _We_ love the page that draws its flavour\r\n          From Draftsman, Etcher, and Engraver\r\n          And hint the booby (by his favour)\r\n            _His_ gloomy copy to \"ILLUSTRATE.\"\r\n\r\n          _Bibliosophia_; p. v.\r\n\r\n     At this stage of our inquiries, let me submit a new remedy\r\n     as an acquisition to the _Materia Medica_, of which many\r\n     first-rate physicians may not be aware--by proposing a\r\n\r\n     =Recipe for Illustration.=\r\n\r\n     Take any passage from any author--to wit: the following\r\n     (which I have done, quite at random) from SPEED: '_Henry le\r\n     Spenser_, the warlike _Bishop of Norwich_, being drawn on by\r\n     _Pope Vrban_ to preach _the Crusade_, and to be General\r\n     against _Clement_ (whom sundry _Cardinals_ and great\r\n     _Prelates_ had also elected Pope) having a fifteenth granted\r\n     to him, for that purpose, by _parliament_,' &c. _Historie of\r\n     Great Britaine_, p. 721, edit. 1632. Now, let the reader\r\n     observe, here are _only four_ lines; but which, to be\r\n     PROPERLY ILLUSTRATED, should be treated thus: 1st, procure\r\n     all the portraits, at all periods of his life, of _Henry le\r\n     Spencer_; 2dly, obtain every view, ancient and modern, like\r\n     or unlike, of the city of _Norwich_; and, if fortune favour\r\n     you, of _every Bishop of the same see_; 3dly, every portrait\r\n     of _Pope Vrban_ must be procured; and as many prints and\r\n     drawings as can give some notion of _the Crusade_--together\r\n     with a few etchings (if there be any) of _Peter the Hermit_\r\n     and _Richard I._, who took such active parts in the Crusade;\r\n     4thly, you must search high and low, early and late, for\r\n     every print of _Clement_; 5thly, procure, or you will be\r\n     wretched, as many fine prints of _Cardinals_ and _Prelates_,\r\n     singly or in groups, as will impress you with a proper idea\r\n     of _the Conclave_; and 6thly, see whether you may not\r\n     obtain, at some of our most distinguished old-print sellers,\r\n     views of the _house of Parliament_ at the period (A.D.\r\n     1383.) here described!!! The result, gentle reader, will be\r\n     this: you will have work enough cut out to occupy you for\r\n     one whole month at least, from rise to set of sun--in\r\n     parading the streets of our metropolis: nor will the expense\r\n     in _coach_ hire, or _shoe leather_, be the least which you\r\n     will have to encounter! The prints themselves may cost\r\n     _some_thing! Lest any fastidious and cynical critic should\r\n     accuse me, and with apparent justice, of gross exaggeration\r\n     or ignorance in this _recipe_, I will inform him, on good\r\n     authority, that a late distinguished and highly respectable\r\n     female collector, who had commenced an ILLUSTRATED BIBLE,\r\n     procured not fewer than _seven hundred prints_ for the\r\n     illustration of the 20th, 21st, 22d, 23d, 24th, and 25th\r\n     verses of the 1st chapter of Genesis! The illustrated copy\r\n     of Mr. Fox's Historical work, mentioned in the first edition\r\n     of this work, p. 63, is now in the possession of Lord\r\n     Mountjoy. The similar copy of Walter Scott's edition of\r\n     Dryden's works, which has upwards of 650 portraits, is yet\r\n     in the possession of Mr. Miller, the bookseller.]\r\n\r\nGranger's work seems to have sounded the tocsin for a general rummage\r\nafter, and plunder of, old prints. Venerable philosophers, and veteran\r\nheroes, who had long reposed in unmolested dignity within the\r\nmagnificent folio volumes which recorded their achievements, were\r\ninstantly dragged forth from their peaceful abodes, to be inlaid by\r\nthe side of some clumsy modern engraving, within an _Illustrated\r\nGranger_!\r\n\r\nNor did the madness stop here. Illustration was the order of the day;\r\nand _Shakspeare_[434] and _Clarendon_ became the next objects of its\r\nattack. From these it has glanced off, in a variety of directions, to\r\nadorn the pages of humbler wights; and the passion, or rather this\r\nsymptom of the Bibliomania, yet rages with undiminished force. If\r\njudiciously treated, it is, of all the symptoms, the least liable to\r\nmischief. To possess a series of well-executed portraits of\r\nillustrious men, at different periods of their lives, from blooming\r\nboyhood to phlegmatic old age, is sufficiently amusing; but to possess\r\n_every_ portrait, _bad_, _indifferent_, and _unlike_, betrays such a\r\ndangerous and alarming symptom as to render the case almost incurable!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 434: Lysander would not have run on in this\r\n     declamatory strain, if it had been _his_ good fortune, as it\r\n     has been _mine_, to witness the extraordinary copy of an\r\n     ILLUSTRATED SHAKSPEARE in the possession of Earl Spencer;\r\n     which owes its magic to the perseverance and taste of the\r\n     Dowager Lady Lucan, mother to the present Countess Spencer.\r\n     For sixteen years did this accomplished Lady pursue the\r\n     pleasurable toil of illustration; having commenced it in her\r\n     50th, and finished it in her 66th year. Whatever of taste,\r\n     beauty, and judgment in decoration--by means of portraits,\r\n     landscapes, houses, and tombs--flowers, birds, insects,\r\n     heraldic ornaments, and devices,--could dress our immortal\r\n     bard in a yet more fascinating form, has been accomplished\r\n     by the noble hand which undertook so Herculean a task--and\r\n     with a truth, delicacy, and finish of execution, which have\r\n     been rarely equalled! These magnificent volumes (being the\r\n     folio edition printed by Bulmer) are at once beautiful and\r\n     secured by green velvet binding, with embossed clasps and\r\n     corners of solid silver, washed with gold. Each volume is\r\n     preserved in a silken cover--and the whole is kept inviolate\r\n     from the impurities of bibliomaniacal miasmata, in a\r\n     sarcophagus-shaped piece of furniture of cedar and mahogany.\r\n     What is the pleasure experienced by the most resolute\r\n     antiquary, when he has obtained a peep at the inmost\r\n     sarcophagus of the largest pyramid of Egypt, compared with\r\n     that which a tasteful bibliomaniac enjoys upon contemplating\r\n     this illustrated Shakespeare, now reposing in all the\r\n     classical magnificence and congenial retirement of its\r\n     possessor?--But why do I surpass Lysander in the warmth and\r\n     vehemence of narration! And yet, let me not forget that the\r\n     same noble owner has _another_ illustrated copy of the SAME\r\n     BARD, on a smaller scale, of which mention has already been\r\n     made in my account of the donor of it, the late George\r\n     Steevens. Turn, gentle reader, for one moment, to page 428,\r\n     ante. The illustrated CLARENDON, above hinted at by\r\n     Lysander, is in the possession of Mr. H.A. Sutherland; and\r\n     is, perhaps, a matchless copy of the author: every siege,\r\n     battle, town, and house-view--as well as portrait--being\r\n     introduced within the leaves. I will not even hazard a\r\n     conjecture for how many _thousand pounds_ its owner might\r\n     dispose of it, if the inclination of parting with it should\r\n     ever possess him. The British Museum has recently been\r\n     enriched with a similar copy of PENNANT'S _London_, on large\r\n     paper. Prints and drawings of all descriptions, which could\r\n     throw light upon the antiquities of our metropolis, are\r\n     inserted in this extraordinary copy, which belonged to the\r\n     late Mr. Crowles; who expended 2000_l._ upon the same, and\r\n     who bequeathed it, in the true spirit of _virtû_, to the\r\n     Museum. Let CRACHERODE and CROWLES be held in respectful\r\n     remembrance!]\r\n\r\nThere is another mode of _illustrating copies_ by which this symptom\r\nof the Bibliomania may be known; it consists in bringing together,\r\nfrom different works, [including newspapers and magazines, and by\r\nmeans of the scissars, or otherwise by transcription] every page or\r\nparagraph which has any connexion with the character or subject under\r\ndiscussion. This is a useful[435] and entertaining mode of\r\nillustrating a favourite author; and copies of works of this nature,\r\nwhen executed by skilful hands, should be deposited in public\r\nlibraries; as many a biographical anecdote of eminent literary\r\ncharacters is preserved in consequence. I almost ridiculed the idea of\r\nan _Illustrated Chatterton_, 'till the sight of your friend BERNARDO'S\r\ncopy, in eighteen volumes, made me a convert to the utility that may\r\nbe derived from a judicious treatment of this symptom of the\r\nBibliomania: and indeed, of a rainy day, the same bibliomaniac's\r\nsimilar copy of _Walton's Complete Angler_ affords abundant amusement\r\nin the perusal.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 435: Numerous are the instances of the peculiar\r\n     use and value of copies of this kind; especially to those\r\n     who are engaged in publications of a similar nature. OLDYS'S\r\n     _interleaved Langbaine_ (of Mr. Reed's transcript of which a\r\n     copy is in the possession of Mr. Heber) is re-echoed in\r\n     almost every recent work connected with the belles-lettres\r\n     of our country. Oldys himself was unrivalled in this method\r\n     of illustration; if, exclusively of Langbaine, his copy of\r\n     _Fuller's Worthies_ [once Mr. Steevens', now Mr. Malone's.\r\n     See _Bibl. Steevens_, no. 1799] be alone considered! This\r\n     Oldys was the oddest mortal that ever wrote. Grose, in his\r\n     _Olio_, gives an amusing account of his having \"a number of\r\n     small parchment bags inscribed with the names of the persons\r\n     whose lives he intended to write; into which he put every\r\n     circumstance and anecdote he could collect, and from thence\r\n     drew up his history.\" See Noble's _College of Arms_, p. 420.\r\n     Thus far the first edition of this work; p. 64. It remains\r\n     to add that, whatever were the singularities and\r\n     capriciousness of Oldys, his talents were far beyond\r\n     mediocrity; as his publication of the _Harleian Miscellany_,\r\n     and _Raleigh's History of the World_, abundantly prove. To\r\n     the latter, a life of Raleigh is prefixed; and the number of\r\n     pithy, pleasant, and profitable notes subjoined shew that\r\n     Oldys's bibliographical talents were not eclipsed by those\r\n     of any contemporary. His _British Librarian_ has been more\r\n     than once noticed in the preceding pages: vide p. 51: 468.\r\n     There is a portrait of him, in a full-dressed suit and\r\n     bag-wig, in one of the numbers of the European Magazine;\r\n     which has the complete air of a fine gentleman. Let me just\r\n     observe, in elucidation of what Lysander above means by this\r\n     latter mode of illustrating copies, that in the Bodleian\r\n     library there is a copy of _Kuster's edition of Suidas_\r\n     filled, from beginning to end, with MS. notes and excerpts\r\n     of various kinds, by the famous D'Orville, tending to\r\n     illustrate the ancient lexicographer.]\r\n\r\nLIS. Forgive me, if I digress a little. But is not the knowledge of\r\n_rare_, _curious_, and _beautiful Prints_--so necessary, it would\r\nseem, towards the perfecting of _illustrated copies_--is not this\r\nknowledge of long and difficult attainment?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Unquestionably, this knowledge is very requisite towards\r\nbecoming a complete pupil in the SCHOOL OF GRANGER.[436] Nor is it, as\r\nyou very properly suppose, of short or easy acquirement.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 436: GRANGER'S _Biographical History of England_\r\n     was first published, I believe, in 1769, 4to., 2 vols. It\r\n     has since undergone four impressions; the last being in\r\n     1804, 8vo., 4 vols. _A Continuation of the same_, by the\r\n     Rev. MARK NOBLE, was published in 1807, 8vo., 3 vols.: so\r\n     that if the lover of rare and curious prints get possession\r\n     of these volumes, with AMES'S _Catalogue of English Heads_,\r\n     1748, 8vo.; and WALPOLE'S _Catalogue of Engravers_, 1775,\r\n     8vo.; BROMLEY'S _Catalogue of Engraved Portraits_, 1793,\r\n     4to.; together with Catalogues of English Portraits, being\r\n     the collections of Mr. BARNARD, Sir W. MUSGRAVE, Mr. TYSSEN,\r\n     Sir JAMES-WINTER LAKE; and many other similar catalogues put\r\n     forth by Mr. RICHARDSON and Mr. GRAVE; he may be said to be\r\n     in a fair way to become master of the whole arcana of\r\n     PRINT-COLLECTING. But let him take heed to the severe\r\n     warning-voice uttered by ROWE MORES, in his criticism upon\r\n     the Catalogue of English Heads, published by Ames: 'This\r\n     performance (says the splenetic and too prophetic critic) is\r\n     not to be despised: judiciously executed, a work of this\r\n     sort would be an appendage entertaining and useful to the\r\n     readers of English biography; and it ought to be done at the\r\n     common labour, expense, and charges of these\r\n     _Iconoclasts_--because their depredations are a grand\r\n     impediment to another who should attempt it: and if this\r\n     _goût_ for prints and thieving continues, let private owners\r\n     and public libraries look well to their books, for there\r\n     will not remain a valuable book ungarbled by their\r\n     connoisseuring villany: for neither honesty nor oaths\r\n     restrain them. Yet these _fanciers_, if prints themselves\r\n     are to be collected, instead of being injurious to every\r\n     body, might make themselves serviceable to posterity, and\r\n     become a kind of _medalists_ (who, by the bye, are almost as\r\n     great thieves as themselves, though the hurt they do is not\r\n     so extensive, as it lies chiefly among themselves, who all\r\n     hold this doctrine, that \"exchange is no robbery;\" but, if\r\n     they could filch without exchanging, no scruple of\r\n     conscience would prevent them): we say they might render\r\n     themselves useful to posterity, by gathering together the\r\n     historical, political, satyrical, anecdotal and temporal\r\n     pieces, with which the age abounds; adding an explanation of\r\n     the intent and meaning for the instruction and amusement of\r\n     times to come. The misfortune is, they must buy the one, but\r\n     they can steal the other; and steal they will, although\r\n     watched with the eyes of Argus: unless the valuables, like\r\n     some other _jocalia_, are shewn to them through a grate; and\r\n     even _then_, the keeper must be vigilant!' _Of English\r\n     Founders and Foundries_; p. 85. This extract is curious on\r\n     account of the tart, but just, sentiments which prevail in\r\n     it; but, to the bibliomaniac, it is doubly curious, when he\r\n     is informed that _only eighty copies_ of this Typographical\r\n     Treatise (of 100 pages--including the Appendix) were\r\n     printed. The author was a testy, but sagacious,\r\n     bibliomaniac, and should have been introduced among his\r\n     brethren in PART V. It is not, however, too late to subjoin\r\n     the following: _Bibliotheca Moresiana. A Catalogue of the\r\n     Large and Valuable Library of Printed Books, rare old\r\n     tracts, Manuscripts, Prints, and Drawings, Copper Plates,\r\n     sundry Antiquities, Philosophical Instruments, and other\r\n     Curiosities, of that eminent British Antiquary_, the late\r\n     Rev. and learned EDWARD ROWE MORES, F.A.S., deceased, &c.\r\n     Sold by auction by Mr. Patterson, August 1779. This\r\n     collection exhibited, like its owner, a strange mixture of\r\n     what was curious, whimsical, and ingenious in human nature.\r\n     There were 2838 lots of printed books. _The rare old\r\n     black-letter books and tracts_, begin at p. 52.]\r\n\r\nALMAN. How so? A very little care, with a tolerably good taste, is\r\nonly required to know when a print is _well engraved_.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Alas, Madam! the excellence of engraving is oftentimes but a\r\n_secondary_ consideration!\r\n\r\nBELIN. Do pray explain.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. I will, and as briefly and perspicuously as possible.\r\n\r\nThere are, first, _all the varieties of the same print_[437] to be\r\nconsidered!--whether it have the _name of the character_, or _artist_,\r\nomitted or subjoined: whether the head of the print be without the\r\nbody, or the body without the head--and whether this latter be\r\nfinished, or in the outline, or ghostly white! Then you must go to\r\n_the dress_ of this supposed portrait:--whether full or plain; court\r\nor country-fashioned: whether it have a hat, or no hat; feather, or no\r\nfeather; gloves, or no gloves; sword, or no sword; and many other such\r\nmomentous points.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 437: The reader, by means of the preceding note,\r\n     having been put in possession of some of the principal works\r\n     from which information, relating to PRINT-COLLECTING may be\r\n     successfully gleaned, it remains for me--who have been\r\n     described as sitting in a corner to compile notes for\r\n     Lysander's text-discourse--to add something by way of\r\n     illustration to the above sweeping satire.

King and Lochée, April, 1810.\r\n\r\n     But it is time to pause. The present note may have\r\n     completely served to shew, not only that Lysander was right\r\n     in drawing such bold conclusions respecting the consequences\r\n     resulting from the publication of Granger's Biographical\r\n     History, and the capriciousness of print-fanciers respecting\r\n     impressions _in their various stages_, and with _all their\r\n     varieties_,--but, that the pursuit of PRINT-COLLECTING is\r\n     both costly and endless. For one 'fine and rare' _print_, by\r\n     Hollar, Faithorne, Elstracke, the Passes, Delaram, or White,\r\n     how many truly precious and useful _volumes_ may be\r\n     collected? \"All this is vastly fine reasoning\"--methinks I\r\n     hear a Grangerite exclaim--\"but compare the comfort afforded\r\n     by your 'precious and useful volumes' with that arising from\r\n     the contemplation of eminent and extraordinary characters,\r\n     executed by the _burin_ of some of those graphic heroes\r\n     before-mentioned--and how despicable will the dry unadorned\r\n     volume appear!! On a dull, or rainy day, look at an\r\n     illustrated Shakespeare, or Hume, and then find it in your\r\n     heart, if you can, to depreciate the GRANGERIAN PASSION!!\" I\r\n     answer, the Grangerite is madder than the Bibliomaniac:--and\r\n     so let the matter rest.]\r\n\r\nNext let us discuss the serious subject of the _background_!--whether\r\nit be square or oval; dark or light; put in or put out; stippled or\r\nstroked; and sundry other similar, but most important, considerations.\r\nAgain; there are engravings of _different sizes_, and _at different\r\nperiods_, of the same individual, or object: and of these, the\r\nvarieties are as infinite as of any of those attached to the vegetable\r\nsystem. I will not attempt even an outline of them. But I had nearly\r\nforgotten to warn you, in your REMBRANDT _Prints_, to look sharply\r\nafter _the Burr_!\r\n\r\nALMAN. Mercy on us--what is this _Burr_?!\r\n\r\nLYSAND. A slight imperfection only; which, as it rarely occurs, makes\r\nthe impression more valuable. It is only a sombre tinge attached to\r\nthe copper, before the plate is sufficiently polished by being worked;\r\nand it gives a smeared effect, like smut upon a lady's face, to the\r\nimpression! But I am becoming satirical. Which is the next symptom\r\nthat you have written down for me to discourse upon?\r\n\r\nLIS. I am quite attentive to this delineation of a _Print\r\nConnoisseur_; and will not fail to mark _all the_ REMBRANDT[438]\r\n_varieties_, and take heed to the _Burr_!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 438: All the book and print world have heard of\r\n     DAULBY'S _Descriptive Catalogue of the works of Rembrandt_,\r\n     &c.

The late Mr. Ireland has been the Linnæus\r\nto whom we are indebted for the most minute and amusing classification\r\nof the almost innumerable varieties of the impressions of Hogarth's\r\nplates.[439]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 439: The Marquis of Bute has, I believe, the most\r\n     extraordinary and complete collection of HOGARTH'S PRINTS\r\n     that is known. Of the _Election Dinner_ there are six or\r\n     seven varieties; gloves, and no gloves; hats, from one to\r\n     the usual number; lemon, and no lemon; punch bowl, and no\r\n     punch bowl. But of these _varying_ prints, the most curious\r\n     is the one known by the name of _Evening_: with a little boy\r\n     and girl, crying, in the back-ground. At first, Hogarth did\r\n     _not_ paint _the girl_, and struck off very few impressions\r\n     of the plate in this state of the picture. A friend\r\n     observing to him that the boy was crying with no apparent\r\n     cause of provocation, Hogarth put in the little girl\r\n     tantalizing him. But--happy he! who has the print of the\r\n     'Evening' _without_ the little girl: fifteen golden guineas\r\n     (rare things now to meet with!) ought not to induce him to\r\n     part with it. Of the copper-plate portraits by Hogarth, the\r\n     original of '_Sarah Malcolm, executed_ 1732,' is among the\r\n     very rarest; a copy of this selling for 7_l._ 17_s._ 6_d._\r\n     at Barnard's sale. The reader has only to procure that most\r\n     interesting of all illustrative works, _Hogarth Illustrated\r\n     by John Ireland_, 1793, (2d edit.) 3 vols., 8vo.; and, for a\r\n     comparatively trifling sum, he may be initiated into all the\r\n     mysteries of Hogarthian _virtû_. The late Right Hon. W.\r\n     Wyndham's collection of Hogarth's prints, bequeathed to him\r\n     by Mr. George Steevens, was _bought in_ for little more than\r\n     300 guineas.]\r\n\r\nLIS. I will stick to Rembrandt and leave Hogarth at rest. But surely,\r\nthis rage for _Portrait Collecting_ cannot be of long duration.

But we forget\r\nour symptoms of the Bibliomania.\r\n\r\nBELIN. As I am the examiner, I here demand of you, Sir, what may be\r\nthe meaning of the _fourth symptom_ of the bibliomaniacal disease,\r\nwhich you call UNIQUE COPIES?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. A passion for a book of which only one copy was printed, or\r\nwhich has any peculiarity about it[441] by either, or both, of the\r\nforegoing methods of illustration--or which is remarkable for its\r\nsize, beauty, and condition--or has any embellishment, rare, precious\r\nand invaluable--which the researches of the most sedulous\r\nbibliomaniac, for three and thirty long years, would not be able to\r\nproduce--is indicative of a rage for _unique copies_; and is\r\nunquestionably a strong prevailing symptom of the Bibliomania. Let me\r\ntherefore urge every sober and cautious collector not to be fascinated\r\nby the terms \"_Curious and rare_;\" which 'in slim italics' (to copy\r\nDr. Ferriar's happy expression[442]) are studiously introduced into\r\nBooksellers' catalogues to lead the unwary astray. Such a Collector\r\nmay fancy himself proof against the temptation; and will, in\r\nconsequence, call _only to look at_ this unique book, or set of books;\r\nbut--led away by the passion which inflamed BERRYER and\r\nCAILLARD[443]--when he views the morocco binding, silk water-tabby\r\nlining, blazing gilt edges; when he turns over the white and unspotted\r\nleaves; gazes on the amplitude of margin; on a rare and lovely print\r\nintroduced; and is charmed with the soft and coaxing manner in which,\r\nby the skill of Herring, Mackinlay, Rodwell, Lewis, or Faulkener,\r\n\"leaf succeeds to leaf\"--he can no longer bear up against the\r\ntemptation; and, confessing himself vanquished, purchases, and\r\nretreats--exclaiming with Virgil's shepherd----\r\n\r\n     Ut vidi, ut perii--ut me malus abstulit error!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 441: Let us again quote a stanza from the\r\n     'Aspirant:'\r\n\r\n          FOURTH MAXIM.\r\n\r\n          Who in _all_ copies finds delight--\r\n          The wrong not scenting from the right--\r\n          And, with a choiceless appetite,\r\n            Just comes to _feed_, ... like Soph, or Templar,\r\n          Out on his iron stomach!--_we_\r\n          Have rarities we merely _see_,\r\n          Nor taste our Phoenix though it be ...\r\n            Serv'd up in the \"UNIQUE EXEMPLAR,\"\r\n\r\n          _Bibliosophia_, p. v.\r\n\r\n     One of the most curious proofs of the seductive popularity\r\n     of unique copies may be drawn from the following excerpt\r\n     from a catalogue of a Library sold at Utrecht in 1776; which\r\n     was furnished me by Mr. H. Ellis from a copy of the\r\n     catalogue in the possession of Mr. Cayley of the\r\n     Augmentation Office.\r\n\r\n     NO. 6870. Les Avantures de Telemaque, 8o.

Mais\r\n     il est _de la main de la jeune Princesse Wilhelmine Auguste\r\n     de Saxe-Weimar, qui y a appris le François en_ 1701!!!'\r\n\r\n     I will mention a unique copy of a somewhat different cast of\r\n     character. Of the magnificent and matchless edition of\r\n     Shakspeare, printed by Mr. Bulmer and published by Mr.\r\n     Nicols, between the years 1790 and 1805, there were one\r\n     hundred copies, of the first six plays only, struck off upon\r\n     imperial folio, or _Colombier paper_; in which the large\r\n     engravings, published at the Shakspeare Gallery (now the\r\n     British Institution) might be incorporated and bound up. The\r\n     late George Steevens undertook the revision of the text,\r\n     intending to complete the entire plays in a similar form;\r\n     but the trouble and expense attending this part of the\r\n     undertaking were so great that the further prosecution of it\r\n     was abandoned. Mr. Bulmer preserved the whole of the\r\n     proof-sheets of this partial Colombier impression; and to\r\n     form a '_unique_ edition' (these are his own words) he bound\r\n     them up in the exact order in which the plays were printed.\r\n     On the margins of many of the sheets, besides the various\r\n     corrections, emendations, and notes to the printer, by Mr.\r\n     Steevens, there are some original sonnets, a scene for a\r\n     burlesque tragedy, and other happy effusions from the pen of\r\n     the same elegant and learned editor. Need I ask the reader,\r\n     whether he would have the _barbouillé_ (unique) copy of\r\n     Telemaque of the young Princesse Wilhelmine Auguste de\r\n     Saxe-Weimar (like the Vicar of Wakefield, I like to give the\r\n     full name) or Mr. Bulmer's similar copy of Shakspeare? The\r\n     difference would soon be found in King Street or the Strand!\r\n     I must mention one more example--of a nature different from\r\n     both the preceding--of what Lysander has above, elaborately,\r\n     and perhaps, a little confusedly, described as unique\r\n     copies. It is Colonel Stanley's copy of _De Bry_ (see a\r\n     superb one before noticed) which is bound in seven folio\r\n     volumes, in blue morocco, by Padaloup, and is considered\r\n     superior to every known copy. It contains all the maps and\r\n     prints, with their variations, according to the\r\n     _Bibliographie Instructive_, no. 4230, _Cat. de Paris de\r\n     Meyzieu_, 1790; no. 486, _Cat. de Santander_, no.\r\n     3690; and _Camus sur les Collections des Grands et Petits\r\n     Voyages_, 1802, 4to.: with both editions of the first nine\r\n     parts of the West Indies, and duplicates of parts x. and xi.\r\n     It has also a considerable number of duplicate plates, where\r\n     a superior impression could be procured at any expense. The\r\n     owner of this unique copy, of a work unrivalled for its\r\n     utility and elegance, is distinguished for a noble\r\n     collection, bound by our choicest binders, in whatever is\r\n     splendid and precious in the Belles Lettres, Voyages, and\r\n     Travels. Take two more illustrations, kind-hearted\r\n     reader!----_Goldsmith's Deserted Village_, 1802.

Berryer, the\r\n     father-in-law of Lamoignon, is made at p. 84, ante. The\r\n     reader is here presented with a more finished portrait of\r\n     this extraordinary bibliomaniac: a portrait, which will\r\n     excite his unbounded admiration, if not envy!--for such a\r\n     careful and voluptuous collector, in regard to _binding_,\r\n     was, I believe, never before known; nor has he been since\r\n     eclipsed. 'M. Berryer, successivement Secrétaire d'Etat au\r\n     Département de la Marìne, Ministre, puis Garde des Sceaux de\r\n     France, s'étoit occupé pendant près de quarante années à se\r\n     former un cabinet des plus beaux livres grecs et latins,\r\n     anciennes éditions, soit de France, soit des pays étrangers,\r\n     &c. Par un soin et une patience infatigables, à l'aide de\r\n     plusieurs coopérateurs éclairés, savans même en\r\n     Bibliographie, qui connoissoient ses études, délassement de\r\n     ses places, il avoit recueilli les plus belles éditions; de\r\n     telle sorte qu'il a toujours su se procurer un exemplaire\r\n     parfait de chaque édition par un moyen simple quoique\r\n     dispendieux. Si les Catalogues des ventes publiques lui\r\n     apprenoient qu'il existoit un exemplaire _plus beau, plus\r\n     grand de marge, mieux conservé_, de tout auteur, &c., que\r\n     celui qu'il possédoit, il le fasoit acquérir sans\r\n     s'embarrasser du prix, et il se défaisoit à perte de\r\n     l'exemplaire moins beau. La majeure partie des auteurs\r\n     anciens et modernes de son cabinet a été changée huit ou dix\r\n     fois de cette manière. Il ne _s'arrêtoit_ qu'après s'être\r\n     assuré qu'il avoit _le plus bel exemplaire connu_, soit pour\r\n     la marge, soit pour la force du papier, soit pour la\r\n     magnificence de la conservation et _de la relieure_.' 'A\r\n     l'égard des ouvrages d'editions modernes, même celles faites\r\n     en pays étranger, M. Berryer vouloit les avoir en feuilles:\r\n     il en faisoit choisir, dans plusieurs exemplaires, un\r\n     parfait, et il le faisoit relier _en maroquin de choix_; le\r\n     Ministere de la Marìne qu'il avoit rempli, lui ayant donné\r\n     toutes les facilités d'en être abondamment et fidèlement\r\n     pourvu dans toutes les Echelles du Levant. On collationnoit\r\n     ensuite pour vérifier s' il n'y avoit ni transposition, ni\r\n     omission de feuilles ou de pages?!!' _Cat. M. Lamoignon_,\r\n     1791. pref. p. ij. iij. Berryer was slightly copied by\r\n     Caillard (of whom see p. 76, ante) in the luxury of\r\n     _book-binding_. 'M. Caillard avoit le soin _de faire\r\n     satiner_ presque tous livres qu'il faisoit relier, et\r\n     principalement les grands ouvrages; qu'il est difficile\r\n     d'avoir parfaitement reliés sans ce precedé.' _Cat. de\r\n     Caillard_; p. x. (avertisement.) But I know not whether\r\n     Caillard did not catch the phrensy from the elder Mirabeau.\r\n     In the catalogue of his books, p. II., we are thus told of\r\n     him:--'l'acquisition d'un _beau livre_ lui causoit des\r\n     transports de joie inexprimables: il l'examinoit, l'admiriot\r\n     [Transcriber's Note: l'admiroit]: il vouloit que chacun\r\n     partagêat avec lui le même enthousiasme.' His biographer\r\n     properly adds: 'De quelle surprise n'auroit-on pas été, si\r\n     l'on eût su que c'etoit la le même homme qui, du haut de la\r\n     tribune, faisoit trembler les despotes et les factieux!'\r\n     Ponder here, gentle reader, upon the effects of a\r\n     _beautiful_ book! Let no one, however, imagine that we\r\n     _grave Englishmen_ are averse or indifferent to 'le luxe de\r\n     la relieure'!! No: at this present moment, we have the best\r\n     bookbinders in Europe; nor do we want good authority for the\r\n     encouragement of this fascinating department relating to the\r\n     Bibliomania. Read here what Mr. Roscoe hath so eloquently\r\n     written in commendation of it: 'A taste for the exterior\r\n     decoration of books has lately arisen in this country, in\r\n     the gratification of which no small share of ingenuity has\r\n     been displayed; but if we are to judge of the present\r\n     predilection for learning by the degree of expense thus\r\n     incurred, we must consider it as greatly inferior to that of\r\n     the Romans during the times of the first Emperors, or of the\r\n     Italians at the 15th century. And yet it is, perhaps,\r\n     difficult to discover why a FAVOURITE BOOK should not be as\r\n     proper an object of elegant ornament as the head of a cane,\r\n     the hilt of a sword, or the latchet of a shoe.' _Lorenzo de\r\n     Medici_; vol. ii., 79, 8vo. edition. Did Geyler allude to\r\n     such bibliomaniacs in the following sentence? Sunt qui\r\n     libros inaurant et serica tegimenta apponunt preciosa et\r\n     superba. Grandis hæc fatuitas! _Navicula, sive Speculum\r\n     Fatuorum_; (Navis Stultifera) _sign. B. v. rev._]\r\n\r\nBELIN.

It only means, Belinda, that this said shepherd was blockhead\r\nenough to keep gazing upon his beloved fair, although every glance\r\nshot him through the heart, and killed him a hundred times. Still he\r\ncaressed the cause of his ruin. And so bibliomaniacs hug the very\r\nvolumes of which they oftentimes know they cannot afford the purchase\r\nmoney! I have not forgotten your account of Dr. Dee:[444] but the\r\nladies were then absent.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 444: See p. 262, ante.]\r\n\r\nBELIN. Well, let us now go on to the explanation of the _fifth\r\nsymptom_ of the Bibliomania; which you have called, Copies PRINTED\r\nUPON VELLUM!\r\n\r\nLYSAND. A desire for books printed in this manner[445] is an equally\r\nstrong and general symptom of the Biblomania; but, as these works are\r\nrarely to be obtained of modern date, the collector is obliged to have\r\nrecourse to specimens executed, three centuries ago, in the printing\r\noffices of Aldus, Verard, or the Giunti. Although the _Bibliotheque\r\nImperiale_, at Paris, and the library of Count M'Carthy, at Toulouse,\r\nare said to contain the greatest number of books, printed upon vellum,\r\nyet, those who have been fortunate enough to see copies of this kind\r\nin the libraries of his Majesty, the Duke of Marlborough, Earl\r\nSpencer, Mr. Johnes, and the late Mr. Cracherode (which latter is now\r\nin the British Museum) need not travel on the Continent for the sake\r\nof being convinced of their exquisite beauty and splendour. An\r\n_unique_ copy of the first Livy, upon vellum, (of which the owner has\r\nexcited the envy of foreigners) is a library of itself!--and the\r\nexistence of vellum copies of Wynkyn De Worde's reprint of _Juliana\r\nBarnes's Book of Hawking, &c._, complete in every respect, (to say\r\nnothing of his Majesty's similar copy of Caxton's _Doctrinal of\r\nSapience_, in the finest preservation) are sufficient demonstrations\r\nof the prevalance of this symptoms of the Bibliomania in the times of\r\nour forefathers; so that it cannot be said, as some have asserted, to\r\nhave appeared entirely within the last half century.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 445: William Horman, who was head master of Eton\r\n     school at the opening of the sixteenth century, was, I\r\n     apprehend, the earliest writer in this country who\r\n     propagated those symptoms of the Bibliomania indicative of a\r\n     passion for _large paper_ and _vellum_ copies; for thus\r\n     writes the said Horman, in his _Vulgaria_, printed by\r\n     Pynson, in folio, 1519: a book, curious and interesting upon\r\n     every account. 'The greatest and highest of price, is _paper\r\n     imperial_. (Herbert, vol i., p. 265.) _Parchment leaves_ be\r\n     wont to be ruled, that there may be a _comely margent_:\r\n     also, strait lines of equal distance be draw[en] within,\r\n     that the writing may shew fair,' _fol._ 82. From these two\r\n     sentences (without quoting Horman's praise of the presses of\r\n     Froben and Aldus; fol. 87) I think it may be fairly inferred\r\n     that a love of _large paper_ and _vellum_ copies was\r\n     beginning to display itself in the period just mentioned.\r\n     That this love or passion is now eagerly and generally\r\n     evinced, I shall proceed to give abundant proof; but first\r\n     let me not forget our bibliomaniacal satirist:\r\n\r\n          FIFTH MAXIM.\r\n\r\n          Who blindly take the book display'd\r\n          By pettifoggers in the trade.\r\n          Nor ask of what the leaf was made,\r\n            That _seems like paper_--I can tell 'em,\r\n          That though 'tis possible to squint\r\n          Through any page with letters in't,\r\n          No copy, though an angel print,\r\n            Reads elegantly--but \"on VELLUM.\"\r\n\r\n          _Bibliosophia_, p.

By the kindness of Mr. Roche, banker, at Cork,\r\n     I learn that this collection 'is a truly splendid one.' The\r\n     possessor's talents are not confined to the partial walk of\r\n     bibliography: in his younger years, he was considered one of\r\n     the first gentlemen-violin players in Europe. He quitted\r\n     Ireland forty years ago, and now resides at Toulouse, in his\r\n     70th year, surrounded by a numerous and respectable family.\r\n     His leading passion, in book-collecting, (like his\r\n     countryman's, poor Mr. Quin--who gave 170 guineas for the\r\n     Spira Virgil of 1470, _in membranis_!) is marked by a\r\n     fondness for works _printed upon vellum_.

In our own\r\n     country, however, the finest VELLUM LIBRARY in the world\r\n     might be composed from the collections of His Majesty, the\r\n     Duke of Marlborough, Earl Spencer, Sir M.M. Sykes, Bart.,\r\n     Mr. Johnes, Mr. Coke, and the Quin collection. Yet let us\r\n     not forget the finest _vellum copy_ in the world of the\r\n     first edition of _Aristotle's works_ (wanting one volume)\r\n     which may be seen in the library of Corpus Christi College,\r\n     Oxford. Of Mr. Edward's _similar_ copy _of the first Livy_,\r\n     Lysander and myself (vide Part III.) have spoken like honest\r\n     bibliomaniacs. Earl Spencer possesses the rival volume,\r\n     printed by the same printers, (Sweynheym and Pannartz) and\r\n     upon the same material, in his Pliny Senior of 1470--But let\r\n     all quiet bibliomaniacs wait with patience till the work of\r\n     Mons. Praet upon this subject, alluded to at p. 68, ante,\r\n     shall have made its appearance! and then--let us see whether\r\n     we can prevail upon some Gnome to transport to us, through\r\n     the 'thin air,' Pynson's '_Ship of Fools_' UPON VELLUM!!]\r\n\r\nLIS. Are we as successful in printing upon vellum as were our\r\nforefathers?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Certainly not; if we except some of the works from the press\r\nof Bodoni--which are oftentimes truly brilliant. But the fault, in\r\ngeneral, is rather in the preparation of the vellum than in the\r\nexecution of the press-work.\r\n\r\nLOREN. You have seen, Lisardo, my small volumes of '_Heures_,' or\r\n'_Missals_,' as they are called; some of them in MS. and others in\r\nprint--and what can be more delicate than the texture of the vellum\r\nleaves, or more perfect than the execution of penmanship and printing?\r\n\r\nALMAN. I have often set whole hours, my dear brother, in contemplating\r\nwith rapture the sparkling radiance of these little volumes; and wish\r\nin my heart I had a few favourite authors executed in a similar\r\nmanner! I should like to employ Bodoni[446] for life.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 446: It is not because Bodoni printed better than\r\n     our popular printers--that his books upon vellum are more\r\n     beautiful than those produced by the London presses--but\r\n     that the Italian vellum (made of the abortive calf) is, in\r\n     general, more white and delicate. There is not, perhaps, a\r\n     lovelier little VELLUM BOOK in existence than the _Castle of\r\n     Otranto_, printed by Bodoni in 1796, 8vo. A copy of this,\r\n     with the plates worked on white satin, was in the collection\r\n     of Mr. G.G. Mills; and sold at the sale of his books in\r\n     1800; no. 181; see p. 447, ante. From the former\r\n     authority it would appear that only six copies were printed\r\n     in this manner. By the kindness of Mr. Edwards, I am in\r\n     possession of a '_Lettera Pastorale_' of Fr. Adeodato\r\n     Turchi--a small tract of 38 pages--printed upon paper, by\r\n     Bodoni, in a style of uncommon delicacy: having all the\r\n     finish and picturesque effect of copper-plate execution. But\r\n     the chef d'oeuvre of Bodoni seems to be an edition of\r\n     _Homer_, in three great folio volumes, each consisting of\r\n     370 pages, with the text only. The artist employed six years\r\n     in the preparations, and the printing occupied eighteen\r\n     months. One hundred and forty copies only were struck off.\r\n     The copy presented to Bonaparte was UPON VELLUM, of a size\r\n     and brilliancy altogether unparalleled. _American Review_,\r\n     no. 1., p. 171. January, 1811. In our admiration of\r\n     Bodoni, let us not forget DIDOT: who printed a single copy\r\n     of _Voltaire's Henriade_ UPON VELLUM, in quarto, with a\r\n     brilliancy of execution, and perfection of vellum, which can\r\n     never be suppassed [Transcriber's Note: surpassed]. This\r\n     copy formerly belonged to a Farmer General, one of Didot's\r\n     most intimate friends, who perished in the Revolution. Didot\r\n     also printed a number of copies of French translations of\r\n     English works, upon the same material: so correct,\r\n     beautiful, and tasteful, that Mr. Bulmer assures me nothing\r\n     could exceed it. All these small richly-feathered birds were\r\n     once here, but have now taken their flight to a warmer\r\n     climate. Our modern books upon vellum are little short of\r\n     being downright wretched. I saw the _Life of Nelson_, in two\r\n     large quartos, printed in this manner; and it would have\r\n     been the first work which I should have recommended a\r\n     first-rate collector to have thrown out of his library.[G]\r\n     Many of the leaves were afflicted with the jaundice beyond\r\n     hope of cure. The censure which is here thrown out upon\r\n     others reaches my own doors: for I attempted to execute a\r\n     single copy of my _Typographical Antiquities_ upon vellum,\r\n     with every possible attention to printing and to the\r\n     material upon which it was to be executed. But I failed in\r\n     every point: and this single wretchedly-looking book, had I\r\n     presevered [Transcriber's Note: persevered] in executing my\r\n     design, would have cost me about _seventy-five_ guineas!]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote G: This book was printed at Bolt Court during the\r\n     apprenticeship of the printer of this edit. of Biblio., who\r\n     speaking from remembrance, ventures to suggest that the\r\n     above remark is rather too strong--although there was\r\n     confessedly a great deal of trouble in procuring good\r\n     vellum. He believes only _one_ copy was done; it was the\r\n     property of Alexander Davidson, Esq. Banker, and, being in\r\n     his library in Ireland, when the mansion was burned down, it\r\n     was destroyed. He had insured it for £600--the Insurance\r\n     office disputed his claim, and a trial at Dublin took place.\r\n     The late Mr. Bensley was subpoenaed to give evidence of\r\n     its value, but, being reluctant to go, he persuaded the\r\n     parties that Warwick, one of his pressmen, who worked it\r\n     off, was a better witness; he accordingly went, his evidence\r\n     succeeding in establishing Mr. Davidson's claim. This same\r\n     Warwick worked off many of the splendid specimens of\r\n     typography mentioned in _Bibliomania_, being one of the very\r\n     best workmen in the Printing business--particularly in\r\n     wood-cuts. He afterwards became private printer to the late\r\n     Sir Egerton Bridges, Bart., at Lee Priory--and is long since\r\n     dead.]\r\n\r\nLIS. I could go on, 'till midnight, indulging my wishes of having\r\nfavourite books printed upon vellum leaves; and at the head of these I\r\nwould put _Crammer's Bible_ for I want scholarship sufficient to\r\nunderstand the _Complutensian Polyglott of Cardinal Ximenes_.[447]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 447: See pages 160, 407, ante.]\r\n\r\nBERLIN. [Transcriber's Note: Belin.] So much for the _Vellum Symptom_.\r\nProceed we now to the _sixth_: which upon looking at my memoranda, I\r\nfind to be the FIRST EDITIONS. What is the meaning of this odd\r\nsymptom?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. From the time of Ancillon to Askew, there has been a very\r\nstrong desire expressed for the possesssion [Transcriber's Note:\r\npossession] of _original_ or _first published editions_[448] of works;\r\nas they are in general superintended and corrected by the author\r\nhimself, and, like the first impressions of prints are considered more\r\nvaluable. Whoever is possessed with a passion for collecting books of\r\nthis kind, may unquestionably be said to exhibit a strong symptom of\r\nthe Bibliomania: but such a case is not quite hopeless, nor is it\r\ndeserving of severe treatment or censure. All bibliographers have\r\ndwelt on the importance of these editions[449] for the sake of\r\ncollation with subsequent ones; and of detecting, as is frequently the\r\ncase, the carelessness displayed by future editors. Of such importance\r\nis the _first edition Shakspeare_[450] considered, on the score of\r\ncorrectness, that a fac-simile reprint of it has been recently\r\npublished. In regard to the Greek and Latin Classics, the possession\r\nof these original editions is of the first consequence to editors who\r\nare anxious to republish the legitimate text of an author. Wakefield,\r\nI believe, always regretted that the first edition of Lucretius had\r\nnot been earlier inspected by him. When he began _his_ edition, the\r\nEditio Princeps was not (as I have understood) in that storehouse of\r\nalmost every thing which is exquisite and rare in ancient and modern\r\nclassical literature--need I add the library of Earl Spencer?[451]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 448: All German and French bibliographers class\r\n     these FIRST EDITIONS among rare books; and nothing is more\r\n     apt to seduce a noviciate in bibliography into error than\r\n     the tempting manner in which, by aid of capital or italic\r\n     types, these EDITIONES PRIMARIÆ or _Editiones Principes_ are\r\n     set forth in the most respectable catalogues published\r\n     abroad as well as at home. But before we enter into\r\n     particulars, we must not forget that this sixth sympton\r\n     [Transcriber's Note: symptom] of the Bibliomania has been\r\n     thus pungently described in the poetical strains of an\r\n     \"aspirant!\"\r\n\r\n          SIXTH MAXIM.\r\n\r\n          Who of Editions recks the least,\r\n          But, when that hog, his mind would feast\r\n          Fattens the intellectual beast\r\n            With old, or new, without ambition,--\r\n          I'll teach the pig to soar on high,\r\n          (If pigs had pinions, by the bye)\r\n          How'er the _last_ may _satisfy_,\r\n          The _bonne bouche_ is the \"FIRST EDITION.\"\r\n\r\n          _Bibliosophia_; p. VI.\r\n\r\n     These first editions are generally, with respect to foreign\r\n     works, printed in the fifteenth or in the early part of the\r\n     sixteenth century: and indeed we have a pretty rich\r\n     sprinkling of a similar description of first editions\r\n     executed in our own country. It is not, therefore, without\r\n     justice that we are described, by foreign bibliographers, as\r\n     being much addicted to this class of books: \"With what\r\n     avidity, and at what great prices, this character of books\r\n     is obtained by the Dutch, and _especially by the English_,\r\n     the very illustrious Zach. Conrad ab Uffenbach shews, in the\r\n     preface to the second volume of his catalogue.\" Vogt; p.\r\n     xx., edit. 1793. There is a curious and amusing article in\r\n     Bayle (English edition, vol i., 672, &c.) about the elder\r\n     Ancillon, who frankly confessed that he \"was troubled with\r\n     the Bibliomania, or disease of buying books.\" Mr. D'Israeli\r\n     says that he \"always purchased _first editions_, and never\r\n     waited for second ones,\" but I find it, in the English\r\n     Bayle, note D, \"he chose _the best_ editions.\" The manner in\r\n     which Ancillon's library was pillaged by the Ecclesiastics\r\n     of Metz (where it was considered as the most valuable\r\n     curiosity in the town) is thus told by Bayle: \"Ancillon was\r\n     obliged to leave Metz: a company of Ecclesiastics, of all\r\n     orders, came from every part, to lay hands on this fine and\r\n     copious library, which had been collected with the utmost\r\n     care during forty years. They took away a great number of\r\n     the books together; and gave a little money, as they went\r\n     out, to a young girl, of twelve or thirteen years of age,\r\n     who looked after them, that they might have it to say they\r\n     had _paid for them_. Thus Ancillon saw that valuable\r\n     collection dispersed, in which, as he was wont to say, his\r\n     chief pleasure and even his heart was placed!\"--Edit. 1734.\r\n     A pleasant circumstance, connected with our present subject,\r\n     occurred to the Rev. Dr. Charles Burney. At a small sale of\r\n     books which took place at Messrs. King and Lochée's, some\r\n     few years ago, the Doctor sent a commission, for some old\r\n     grammatical treatises; and calling with Mr. Edwards to see\r\n     the success of the commission, the latter, in the true\r\n     spirit of bibliomaniacism, pounced upon an anciently-bound\r\n     book, in the lot, which turned out to be--nothing less than\r\n     the _first edition_ of MANILIUS by Regiomontanus: one of the\r\n     very scarcest books in the class of those of which we are\r\n     treating! By the liberality of the purchaser, this _primary\r\n     bijou_ now adorns the noble library of the Bishop of Ely.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 449: An instance of this kind may be adduced from\r\n     the _first edition_ of Fabian, printed in 1516; of which\r\n     Chronicle Messrs.

Ellis, and\r\n     containing various readings from all the editions at the\r\n     foot of the text. \"The antiquary,\" says the late Mr. BRAND,\r\n     \"is desired to consult the edition of Fabian, printed by\r\n     Pynson, in 1516, because there are others, and I remember to\r\n     have seen one in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, with a\r\n     continuation to the end of Queen Mary, 1559, in which the\r\n     language is much modernized.\" _Shakspeare_, edit. 1803, vol.\r\n     xviii., pp. 85, 86.

The biddings rose\r\n     quickly to 20 guineas; a great sum in former times: but the\r\n     Duke was not to be daunted or defeated. A slip of paper was\r\n     handed to him, upon which the propriety of continuing the\r\n     contest was suggested. His Grace took out his pencil; and,\r\n     with a coolness which would have done credit to Prince\r\n     Eugene, he wrote on the same slip of paper, by way of reply--\r\n\r\n                                           lay on Macduff!\r\n          And d----d be he who first cries \"Hold, enough!\"\r\n\r\n     Such a spirit was irresistible, and bore down all\r\n     opposition.

All this is well; and may it never be\r\n     neglected! But there are other characters not less noble,\r\n     and of equal glory to a great nation like our own; and they\r\n     are those who, to the adventitious splendour of hereditary\r\n     rank, add all the worth and talent of a private condition,\r\n     less exposed to temptation, and suited to the cultivation of\r\n     peaceful and literary pursuits.

Thus, not to mention other instances\r\n(which present themselves while noticing the present one), all the\r\nfine things which Colomiés and Reimannus have said about the rarity of\r\nLa Croix du Maine's Bibliothéque, published in 1584, are now\r\nunnecessary to be attended to, since the publication of the ample and\r\nexcellent edition of this work by De La Monnoye and Juvigny, in six\r\nquarto volumes, 1772.\r\n\r\nLIS. Upon the whole, I should prefer the best to the first edition;\r\nand you, Lorenzo, may revel in the possession of your _first\r\nShakespeare_--but give me the last Variorum edition _in twenty-one\r\nvolumes_.\r\n\r\nLOREN. \"Chacun a son gout,\" yet it may be as well to possess them\r\n_both_. Indeed, I not only have these editions, but a great number of\r\nthe early plays printed in quarto;[452] which are considered the _ne\r\nplus ultra_ of Shakspearian bibliomaniacism.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 452: A pretty copious list of these valuable early\r\n     plays will be found at pages 431-2-3-4, ante.]\r\n\r\nBELIN. Much good may these wretchedly printed volumes do you! Now let\r\nme proceed with my pupil. Tell us, good Lysander, what can you\r\npossibly mean by the _seventh symptom_ of the Bibliomania, called TRUE\r\nEDITIONS?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. My definition of this strange symptom will excite your\r\nmirth.[453] Some copies of a work are struck off with deviations from\r\nthe usually received ones, and although these deviations have\r\ngenerally neither sense nor beauty to recommend them (and indeed are\r\nprincipally _defects_!), yet copies of this description are eagerly\r\nsought after by collectors of a certain class. What think you of such\r\na ridiculous passion in the book-way?\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 453: Observing the usual order of notification, we\r\n     will first borrow the poetical aid of \"an aspirant:\"\r\n\r\n          SEVENTH MAXIM.\r\n\r\n          Who dares to \"write me down an ass,\"\r\n          When, spying through the curious mass,\r\n          I rub my hands, and wipe my glass,\r\n            If, chance, an _error_ bless my notice--\r\n          Will prize when drill'd into his duty,\r\n          These lovely warts of ugly beauty;\r\n          For books, when _false_ (it may be new t'ye),\r\n            Are \"TRUE EDITIONS:\"--odd,--but _so_ 'tis.\r\n\r\n     Let us proceed to see whether this biting satire be founded\r\n     upon truth, or not. Accidental variations from the common\r\n     impressions of a work form what are called TRUE EDITIONS:\r\n     and as copies, with such variations (upon the same principle\r\n     as that of _Prints_; vide p. 501-2, ante) are rare, they are\r\n     of course sought after with avidity by knowing\r\n     bibliomaniacs. Thus speaks Ameilhon upon the\r\n     subject:--\"pendant l'impression d'un ouvrage il est arrivé\r\n     un accident qui, à telle page et à telle ligne, a occasioné\r\n     un renversement dans les lettres d'un mot, et que ce\r\n     désordre n'a été rétabli qu'apres le tirage de six ou sept\r\n     exemplaires; ce qui rend ces exemplaires défectueux presque\r\n     uniques, et leur donne, â les entendre, une valeur\r\n     inappréciable; car voila un des grands secrets de cet art,\r\n     qui, au reste, s'acquiert aisément avec de la memoire.\"\r\n     _Mem. de l'Institut_: vol. ii., p. 485. The author of these\r\n     words then goes on to abuse the purchasers and venders of\r\n     these strange books; but I will not quote his saucy tirade\r\n     in defamation of this noble department of bibliomaniacism. I\r\n     subjoin a few examples in illustration of Lysander's\r\n     definition:--_Cæsar. Lug. Bat._ 1636, 12mo. _Printed by\r\n     Elzevir._ In the Bibliotheca Revickzkiana we are informed\r\n     that the _true_ Elzevir edition is known by having the plate\r\n     of a buffalo's head at the beginning of the preface and body\r\n     of the work: also by having the page numbered 153, which\r\n     _ought_ to have been numbered 149. A further account is\r\n     given in my Introduction to the Classics, vol. i., p.\r\n     228.--_Horace_, Londini, 1733, 8vo., 2 vols. Published by\r\n     Pine. The _true_ edition is distinguished by having at page\r\n     108, vol. ii., the _incorrect_ reading \"Post Est.\"--for\r\n     \"Protest.\"--_Virgil._ Lug. Bat., 1636, 12mo. Printed by\r\n     Elzevir. The _true_ edition is known, by having at plate 1,\r\n     before the Bucolics, the following Latin passage _printed in\r\n     red ink_. \"Ego vero frequentes a te literas accepi.\" Consul\r\n     de Bure, no. 2684.--_Idem._ Birmingh. 1763, 4to. Printed\r\n     by Baskerville. A particular account of the _true_ edition\r\n     will be found in the second volume of my \"Introduction to\r\n     the Classics,\" p. 337--too long to be here\r\n     inserted.--_Bocaccio._ Il Decamerone, Venet. 1527, 4to.\r\n     Consult De Bure no. 3667; Bandini, vol. ii. 105, 211;\r\n     (who, however, is extremely laconic upon this edition, but\r\n     copious upon the anterior one of 1516) and Haym, vol. iii.,\r\n     p. 8, edit. 1803. Bibl. Paris., no. 408. Clement. (vol.\r\n     iv. 352,) has abundance of reference, as usual, to\r\n     strengthen his assertion in calling the edition \"_fort\r\n     rare_.\" The reprint, or spurious edition, has always struck\r\n     me as the prettier book of the two. These examples appeared\r\n     in the first edition of this work. I add to them what of\r\n     course I was not enabled to do before. In the second edition\r\n     of _The Bibliomania_, there are some variations in the\r\n     copies of the small paper; and one or two decided ones\r\n     between the small and large. In the small, at page 13, line\r\n     2, we read\r\n\r\n          \"beat with perpetual _forms_.\"\r\n\r\n     in the large, it is properly\r\n\r\n          \"beat with perpetual _storms_.\"\r\n\r\n     Which of these is indicative of the _true_ edition? Again:\r\n     in the small paper, p. 275, line 20, we read properly\r\n\r\n          \"Claudite jam rivos pueri, sat _prata_ biberunt.\"\r\n\r\n     in the large paper,\r\n\r\n          \"Claudite jam rivos pueri, sat _parta_ biberunt.\"\r\n\r\n     It was in my power to have cancelled the leaf in the large\r\n     paper as well as in the small; but I thought it might\r\n     thereby have taken from the former the air of a _true_\r\n     edition; and so the blunder (a mere transposition of the\r\n     letters _ar_) will go down to a future generation in the\r\n     large paper. There is yet another slight variation between\r\n     the small and large. At p. 111, in the account of the\r\n     catalogue of Krohn's books, the concluding sentence wholly\r\n     varies: but I believe there is not an _error_ in either, to\r\n     entitle one to the rank of _Truism_ more than another.[H]]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote H: During the youth of the printer of this book, a\r\n     curious mistake occurred: a splendid folio work was going on\r\n     for Dr. Bonnell Thornton; in a certain page, as printers\r\n     technically say, _a space stood up_; the Dr. (not\r\n     understanding printers' marks) wrote on a head page \"take\r\n     out horizontal line at p. so and so\"--the compositor\r\n     inserted these words as a _displayed line_ in the head-page\r\n     whereon they were written--the reader passed it in the\r\n     revise--and it was so worked off! Being eventually\r\n     detected--the leaf was of course cancelled.]\r\n\r\nALMAN. It seems to me to be downright idiotism. But I suspect you\r\nexaggerate?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. In sober truth, I tell you only what every day's experience in\r\nthe book-market will corroborate.\r\n\r\nBELIN. Well!--what strange animals are you bibliomaniacs. Have we any\r\nother symptom to notice? Yes, I think Lysander made mention of an\r\n_eighth_; called a passion for THE BLACK-LETTER. Can any eyes be so\r\njaundiced as to prefer volumes printed in this crabbed, rough, and\r\ndismal manner?\r\n\r\nLOREN. Treason--downright treason! Lisardo shall draw up a bill of\r\nindictment against you, and Lysander shall be your judge.\r\n\r\nBELIN. My case would then be desperate; and execution must necessarily\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nLIS. I shall be better able to form an opinion of the expediency of\r\nsuch a measure after Lysander has given us his definition of this\r\neighth and last symptom. Proceed, my friend.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Of all symptoms of the Bibliomania, this _eighth_ symptom is\r\nat present the most powerful and prevailing. Whether it was imported\r\ninto this country, from Holland, by the subtlety of Schelhorn[454] (a\r\nknowing writer upon rare and curious books) may be a point worthy of\r\nconsideration. But whatever be its origin, certain is that books\r\nprinted in the =black-letter=, are now coveted with an eagerness unknown\r\nto our collectors in the last century. If the spirits of West,\r\nRatcliffe, Farmer, and Brand, have as yet held any intercourse with\r\neach other, in that place \"from whose bourne no traveller returns,\"\r\nwhich must be the surprise of the three former, on being told, by the\r\nlatter, of the prices given for some of the books at the sale of his\r\nlibrary!\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 454: His words are as follows: \"Ipsa typorum\r\n     ruditas, ipsa illa atra crassaque literarum facies _belle\r\n     tangit sensus_,\" _&c._ Was ever the black-letter more\r\n     eloquently described: see his _Amoentates [Transcriber's\r\n     Note: Amoenitates] Literariæ_, vol. i., p. 5. But for the\r\n     last time, let us listen to the concluding symptomatic\r\n     stanza of an \"aspirant;\"\r\n\r\n          EIGHTH MAXIM.\r\n\r\n          Who dreams the _Type_ should please us all,\r\n          That's not too thin, and not too tall,\r\n          Nor much awry, nor over small,\r\n            And, if but ROMAN, asks no better--\r\n          May die in darkness:--I, for one,\r\n          Disdain to tell the barb'rous Hun\r\n          That Persians but adore the sun\r\n            Till taught to know _our_ God--=Black-Letter=.\r\n\r\n          _Bibliosophia_: p. vii.\r\n\r\n     However cruel may be the notes of one poet, it seems pretty\r\n     clear that the glorious subject, or bibliomaniacal symptom,\r\n     of which we are treating, excited numbers of a softer\r\n     character in the muse of Dr. Ferriar: for thus sings\r\n     he--inspired by the possession of _black-letter_ tomes:\r\n\r\n          In red morocco drest, he loves to boast\r\n          the bloody murder, or the yelling ghost;\r\n          or dismal ballads, sung to crowds of old,\r\n          now cheaply bought for thrice their weight in gold.\r\n\r\n          v. 62-65.\r\n\r\n          Ev'n I, debarr'd of ease and studious hours,\r\n          Confess, mid' anxious toil, its lurking pow'rs.\r\n          How pure the joy, when first my hands unfold\r\n          The small, rare volume, black with tarnished gold!\r\n\r\n          _The Bibliomania_, l. 135-8.\r\n\r\n     But let us attend to a more scientific illustration of this\r\n     eighth symptom. 'BLACK-LETTER, which is used in England,\r\n     descends from the Gothic characters; and is therefore called\r\n     _Gothic_ by some, _old English_ by others; but printers give\r\n     it the name of _Black-Letter_, because its face taking in a\r\n     larger compass than Roman or Italic of the same body, the\r\n     full and spreading strokes thereof appear more _black_ upon\r\n     paper than common.' _Smith's Printer's Grammar_; edit. 1755,\r\n     p. 18. The same definition is given in a recent similar\r\n     work; with the addition that 'black-letter is more expensive\r\n     than Roman or Italic, its broad face requiring an\r\n     extraordinary quantity of ink, which always gives the best\r\n     coloured paper a yellow cast, unless worked upon that of a\r\n     superior quality. It has a good effect in a title-page, if\r\n     disposed with taste.' Stower's _Printer's Grammar_; 1808, p.\r\n     41. To these authorities we may add, from Rowe Mores, that\r\n     'Wynkyn de Worde's letter was of _The Square English_ or\r\n     _Black face_, and has been the pattern for his successors in\r\n     the art.' _Of English Founders and Foundries_; 1778, 8vo. p.\r\n     4, 5. 'The same black-letter printer,' says Palmer or\r\n     Psalmanaazar, 'gave a greater scope to his fancy, and formed\r\n     such a variety of sorts and sizes of letter that, for\r\n     several years after him, none of his successors attempted to\r\n     imitate him therein.' _General History of Printing_; p. 343.\r\n     It is not necessary to collect, in formal array, the\r\n     authorities of foreigners upon this important subject;\r\n     although it may be as well to notice the strange manner in\r\n     which Momoro, in his _Traité elémentaire de L'Imprimerie_,\r\n     p. 185, refers us to an elucidation of the Gothic letter\r\n     ('appelé du nom de certains peuples qui vinrent s'établir\r\n     dans la Gothie, plus de quatre cens ans avant J.C.') in one\r\n     of the plates of Fournier's _Dictionnaire Typographique_:\r\n     vol. ii. p. 205--which, in truth, resembles anything but the\r\n     Gothic type, as understood by modern readers.--Smith and Mr.\r\n     Stower have the hardihood to rejoice at the present general\r\n     extinction of the black-letter. They were not, probably,\r\n     aware of Hearne's eulogy upon it--'As it is a reproach to us\r\n     (says this renowned antiquary) that the Saxon language\r\n     should be so forgot as to have but few (comparatively\r\n     speaking) that are able to read it; so 'tis a greater\r\n     reproach that the BLACK-LETTER, which was the character so\r\n     much in use in our grandfathers' days, should be now (as it\r\n     were) disused and rejected; especially when we know the best\r\n     editions of our English Bible and Common-Prayer (to say\r\n     nothing of other books) are printed in it.' _Robert of\r\n     Gloucester's Chronicle_: vol. i., p. LXXXV. I presume the\r\n     editor and publisher of the forth-coming fac-simile\r\n     re-impression of Juliana Barnes's Book of Hawking, Hunting,\r\n     &c., are of the same opinion with Hearne: and are resolved\r\n     upon eclipsing even the black-letter reputation of the\r\n     afore-named Wynkyn De Worde.--A pleasant black-letter\r\n     anecdote is told by Chevillier, of his having picked up, on\r\n     a bookseller's stall, the first edition of the _Speculum\r\n     Salutis_ sive _Humanæ Salvationis_ (one of the rarest\r\n     volumes in the class of those printed in the middle of the\r\n     fifteenth century) for the small sum of four livres!\r\n     _L'Origine de l'Imprimerie_; p. 281. This extraordinary\r\n     event soon spread abroad, and was circulated in every\r\n     bibliographical journal. Schelhorn noticed it in his\r\n     _Amoenitates Literariæ_: vol. iv. 295-6: and so did\r\n     Maichelius in his _Introd. ad Hist. Lit. et Præcip. Bibl.\r\n     Paris_, p. 122. Nor has it escaped the notice of a more\r\n     recent foreign bibliographer. Ameilhon makes mention of\r\n     Chevillier's good fortune; adding that the work was 'un de\r\n     ces livres rares au premièr degré, qu' un BON BIBLIOMANE ne\r\n     peut voir sans trépigner de joie, si j'ose m'exprimer\r\n     ainsi.' _Mem. de l'Institut_. vol. ii. 485-6. This very\r\n     copy, which was in the Sorbonne, is now in the Imperial,\r\n     library at Paris. _Ibid._ A similar, though less important,\r\n     anecdote is here laid before the reader from a communication\r\n     sent to me by Mr. Wm. Hamper of Birmingham. '\"_Tusser's Five\r\n     Hundred Points of Good Husbandry, black-letter, sewed_,\" was\r\n     valued at SIXPENCE, in a catalogue of a small Collection of\r\n     Books on the sale at the shop of Mr. William Adams,\r\n     Loughborough, in the year 1804: and, after in vain suing the\r\n     coy collector at this humble price, remained unsold to the\r\n     present year, 1809, when (thanks to your _Bibliomania_!) it\r\n     brought A GOLDEN GUINEA.'--I have myself been accused of 'an\r\n     admiration to excess' of black-letter lore; and of\r\n     recommending it in every shape, and by every means, directly\r\n     and indirectly. Yet I have surely not said or done any thing\r\n     half so decisive in recommendation of it as did our great\r\n     moralist, Dr. Johnson: who thus introduces the subject in\r\n     one of his periodical papers.--'The eldest and most\r\n     venerable of this society, was HIRSUTUS: who, after the\r\n     first civilities of my reception, found means to introduce\r\n     the mention of his favourite studies, by a severe censure of\r\n     those who want the due regard for their native country. He\r\n     informed me that he had early withdrawn his attention from\r\n     foreign trifles, and that since he begun to addict his mind\r\n     to serious and manly studies, he had very carefully amassed\r\n     all the _English books_ that were printed in the\r\n     =Black-Letter=. This search he had pursued so diligently that\r\n     he was able to show the deficiencies of the best catalogues.\r\n     He had long since completed his _Caxton_, had three sheets\r\n     of _Treveris_, unknown to antiquaries, and wanted to a\r\n     perfect [collection of] _Pynson_ but two volumes: of which\r\n     one was promised him as a legacy by its present possessor,\r\n     and the other he was resolved to buy at whatever price, when\r\n     Quisquilius' library should be sold. Hirsutus had no other\r\n     reason for the valuing or slighting a book than that it was\r\n     printed in the Roman or the Gothick letter, nor any ideas\r\n     but such as his favourite volumes had supplied: when he was\r\n     serious, he expatiated on the narratives of JOHAN DE\r\n     TREVISA, and, when he was merry, regaled us with a quotation\r\n     from the _Shippe of Fools_.' RAMBLER, no. 177.--Nor was\r\n     the Doctor himself quite easy and happy 'till he had sold,\r\n     in the character of a BOOKSELLER, a few volumes--probably of\r\n     black-letter celebrity. Mr. Boswell relates that 'During the\r\n     last visit which the Doctor made to Litchfield, the friends,\r\n     with whom he was staying missed him one morning at the\r\n     breakfast table. On inquiring after him of the servants,\r\n     they understood that he had set off from Litchfield at a\r\n     very early hour, without mentioning to any of the family\r\n     whither he was going. The day passed without the return of\r\n     the illustrious guest, and the party began to be very uneasy\r\n     on his account, when, just before the supper hour, the door\r\n     opened, and the Doctor stalked into the room. A solemn\r\n     silence of a few minutes ensued; nobody daring to enquire\r\n     the cause of his absence, which was at length relieved by\r\n     Johnson addressing the lady of the house as follows: \"Madam,\r\n     I beg your pardon for the abruptness of my departure this\r\n     morning, but I was constrained to it by my _conscience_.\r\n     Fifty years ago, Madam, on this day, I committed a breach of\r\n     filial piety, which has ever since lain heavy on my mind,\r\n     and has not until this day been expiated. My father, you\r\n     recollect, was a bookseller, and had long been in the habit\r\n     of attending _Walsall Market_; and opening a stall for the\r\n     sale of his books during that day. Confined to his bed by\r\n     indisposition, he requested of me, this time fifty years\r\n     ago, to visit the market, and attend the stall in his place.\r\n     But, Madam, my pride prevented me from doing my duty, and I\r\n     gave my father a refusal. To do away the sin of this\r\n     disobedience, I this day went in a post-chaise to Walsall,\r\n     and going into the market at the time of high business,\r\n     uncovered my head, and stood with it bare an hour before the\r\n     stall which my father had formerly used, exposed to the\r\n     sneers of the by-standers, and the inclemency of the\r\n     weather: a penance, by which I have propitiated Heaven for\r\n     this only instance, I believe, of contumacy towards my\r\n     father.\"'--Is it not probable that Dr. Johnson himself might\r\n     have sold for SIXPENCE, a _Tusser_, which now would have\r\n     brought a 'GOLDEN GUINEA?']\r\n\r\nA perusal of these prices may probably not impress the reader with any\r\nlofty notions of the superiority of the black-letter; but this symptom\r\nof the Bibliomania is, nevertheless, not to be considered as\r\nincurable, or wholly unproductive of good. Under a proper spirit of\r\nmodification, it has done, and will continue to do, essential service\r\nto the cause of English literature. It guided the taste, and\r\nstrengthened the judgment, of Tyrwhitt in his researches after\r\nChaucerian lore. It stimulated the studies of Farmer and Steevens, and\r\nenabled them to twine many a beauteous flower round the brow of their\r\nbeloved Shakspeare.\r\n\r\nIt has since operated, to the same effect, in the labour of Mr.\r\nDouce,[455] the PORSON of old English and French Literature; and in\r\nthe editions of Milton and Spenser, by my amiable and excellent friend\r\nMr. Todd, the public have had a specimen of what the _Black-Letter_\r\nmay perform, when temperately and skilfully exercised.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 455: In the criticisms which have passed upon Mr.\r\n     DOUCE'S \"_Illustrations of Shakspeare and Ancient Manners_,\"\r\n     it has not, I think, been generally noticed that this work\r\n     is distinguished for the singular diffidence and urbanity of\r\n     criticism, as well as depth of learning, which it evinces;\r\n     and for the happy illustrations of the subjects discussed by\r\n     means of fac-simile wood-cuts.]\r\n\r\nI could bring to your recollection other instances; but your own\r\nmemories will better furnish you with them. Let me not, however, omit\r\nremarking that the beautiful pages of the '_Minstrelsy of the Scottish\r\nBorder_' and '_Sir Tristrem_' exhibit, in the notes, (now and then\r\nthickly studded with black-letter references) a proof that the author\r\nof '_The Lay_,' '_Marmion_,' and '_The Lady of the Lake_,' has not\r\ndisdained to enrich his stores with such intelligence as black-letter\r\nbooks impart. In short, although this be a strong and general symptom\r\nof the Bibliomania, it is certainly not attended with injurious\r\neffects when regulated by prudence and discretion. An undistinguishable\r\nvoracious appetite to swallow _every thing_, because printed in the\r\nblack-letter, must necessarily bring on an incurable disease, and,\r\nconsequently, premature dissolution.\r\n\r\nThere is yet one other, and a somewhat generally prevailing, symptom,\r\nindicative of the prevalence of the Bibliomania; and this consists in\r\na fondness for books which have been printed for PRIVATE\r\nDISTRIBUTION[456] only, or at a PRIVATE PRESS. What is executed for a\r\nfew, will be coveted by many; because the edge of curiosity is\r\nwhetted, from a supposition that something very extraordinary, or very\r\ncurious, or very uncommon, is propagated in this said book, so\r\npartially distributed. As to works printed at a _Private Press_, we\r\nhave had a very recent testimony of the avidity with which certain\r\nvolumes, executed in this manner, and of which the impression has been\r\ncomparatively limited, have been sought after by book _Cognoscenti_.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 456: The reader may not object to be made\r\n     acquainted with a few distinguished productions, printed for\r\n     PRIVATE DISTRIBUTION. The reader is indebted to Mr. Bulmer,\r\n     at whose elegant press these works were printed, for the\r\n     information which follows:--MUSEUM WORSLEYANUM; by Sir\r\n     _Richard Worsley_; 1798, 1802, Atlas Folio, 2 vols. The\r\n     first volume of this work, of which 200 copies were printed,\r\n     was finished in May, 1798, and circulated, with the plates\r\n     only of vol. ii., amongst the chosen friends of Sir Richard\r\n     Worsley, the author; who was, at that time, the diplomatic\r\n     Resident at Venice from our Court. The second volume, with\r\n     the letter-press complete, of which only 100 copies were\r\n     printed, was finished in 1802. The entire expense attending\r\n     this rare and sumptuous publication (of which a copy is in\r\n     the library of the Royal Institution) amounted to the\r\n     enormous sum of 27,000_l._ and from the irregularity of\r\n     delivering the second volume of plates, in the first\r\n     instance, without the letter-press, many of the copies are\r\n     incomplete.----THE FATHER'S REVENGE; _by the Earl of\r\n     Carlisle, K.G._ &c., 1800, 4to. A limited impression of this\r\n     very beautiful volume, decorated with engravings from the\r\n     pencil of Westall, was circulated by the noble author among\r\n     his friends. I saw a copy of it, bound in green morocco,\r\n     with the original letter of the donor, in the library of\r\n     Earl Spencer at Althorp.----MOUNT ST. GOTHARD: _By the late\r\n     Duchess of Devonshire_, folio. Only fifty copies of this\r\n     brilliant volume were printed; to a few of which, it is\r\n     said, Lady Diana Beauclerc lent the aid of her ornamental\r\n     pencil, in some beautiful drawings of the wild and romantic\r\n     scenery in the neighbourhood of Mount St.\r\n     Gothard.----DISSERTATION ON ETRUSCAN VASES; _by Mr.\r\n     Christie_. Imperial 4to. With elegant Engravings. Only 100\r\n     copies of this truly classical volume were printed. From the\r\n     death of one or two of the parties, who became originally\r\n     possessed of it, as a present from the author, it has fallen\r\n     to the lot of Mr. Christie to become, professionally, the\r\n     vender of a work which he himself never meant to be sold. A\r\n     copy was very lately disposed of, in this manner, for\r\n     14_l._----BENTLEII EPISTOLÆ; _Edited by_ [the Rev.] _Dr.\r\n     Charles Burney_: 1807, 4to. This is one of the most\r\n     beautiful productions of the Shakspeare press; nor are the\r\n     intrinsic merits of the volume inferior to its external\r\n     splendour. The scarcer copies of it are those in medium\r\n     quarto; of which only 50 were printed: of the imperial\r\n     quarto, there were 150 executed.--I add two more similar\r\n     examples, which were not printed at the Shakspeare\r\n     press:--LORD BALTIMORE'S _Gaudia Poetica_; Lat. Angl. et\r\n     Gall. with plates. (No date). Large quarto. Only ten copies\r\n     of this rare volume were printed, and those distributed\r\n     among the author's friends: a copy of it was sold for 6_l._\r\n     10_s._ at the sale of Mr. Reed's books: see Bibl. Reed,\r\n     no. 6682. It was inserted for sale in the catalogue of\r\n     Mr. Burnham, bookseller at Northampton, A.D. 1796--with a\r\n     note of its rarity subjoined.----VIEWS IN ORKNEY and on the\r\n     NORTH-EASTERN COAST OF SCOTLAND. Taken in 1805. Etched 1807.\r\n     Folio. _By the Marchioness of Stafford._--The letter-press\r\n     consists of twenty-seven pages: the first of which bears\r\n     this unassuming designation; \"Some Account of the Orkney\r\n     Islands, extracted from Dr. Barry's History, and Wallace's\r\n     and Brand's Descriptions of Orkney.\" To this chapter or\r\n     division is prefixed a vignette of _Stroma_; and the chapter\r\n     ends at p. 5. Then follow four views of the Orkney\r\n     Islands.--The next chapter is entitled \"The Cathedral of\r\n     Kirkwall,\" which at the beginning exhibits a vignette of the\r\n     _Cathedral of St. Magnus_, and at the close, at p. 9, a\r\n     vignette of a _Tomb in the Cathedral_. To these succeed two\r\n     plates, presenting Views of the _Inside of the Cathedral_,\r\n     and an _Arch in the Cathedral_.--The third chapter commences\r\n     at p. 11, with \"The Earl of Orkney's Palace,\" to which a\r\n     vignette of a _Street in Kirkwall_ is prefixed. It ends at\r\n     p. 12, and is followed by a plate exhibiting a view of the\r\n     _Door-way of the Earl's Palace_; by another of the _Hall of\r\n     the Earl's Palace_; and by a third containing two Views,\r\n     namely, the _Inside of the Hall_, and, upon a larger scale,\r\n     the _Chimney in the Hall_.--\"The Bay of the Frith\" is the\r\n     subject of the fourth chapter; which exhibits at the\r\n     beginning a vignette of the _Hills of Hoy_. It closes at p.\r\n     14, with a vignette of _The Dwarfy Stone_. Then follow six\r\n     plates, containing a view of the _Bay of Frith_, a _View\r\n     from Hoy_, two views of the _Eastern and Western Circles of\r\n     the Stones of Stennis_, and two views of _Stromness_.--The\r\n     next chapter is entitled \"Duncansbay or Dungsby-head,\" which\r\n     bears in front a vignette of _Wick_, and at the end, in p.\r\n     16, a vignette of the _Castle of Freswick_. Three plates\r\n     follow: the first presenting a view of _Duncansbay-Head_:\r\n     the second, Views of the _Stacks of Hemprigs_ and the _Hills\r\n     of Schrabiner or Schuraben_; the third, a View of _The\r\n     Ord_.--\"The Castle of Helmsdale\" is the title of the\r\n     succeeding chapter, to which is prefixed a vignette of\r\n     _Helmsdale Castle_. It ends at p. 19, with a vignette of the\r\n     _Bridge of Brora_. Then follow two plates, presenting Views\r\n     of _Helmsdale Castle_, and the _Coast of Sutherland_.--The\r\n     subject of the next chapter is \"Dunrobin Castle,\" (the\r\n     ancient seat of her Ladyship's ancestors, and now a\r\n     residence of her Ladyship,) which presents, at the\r\n     beginning, a vignette of _Dunrobin Castle_, and after the\r\n     close of the chapter, at p. 23, four plates; the first of\r\n     which is a View of _Dunrobin Castle_ and the surrounding\r\n     scenery; the second, a smaller View of the _Castle_: the\r\n     third, a View of _Druid Stones_, with another of _Battle\r\n     Stones in Strathflete_: and the fourth, _Dornoch, with the\r\n     Thane's Cross_.--The last chapter is entitled \"The Chapel of\r\n     Rosslyn,\" to which is prefixed a vignette of _Rosslyn\r\n     Chapel_. It is followed by four plates; the first exhibiting\r\n     a View of a _Column in Rosslyn Chapel_; the second, a\r\n     _Door-way in the Chapel_; the third, the _Tomb of Sir\r\n     William St. Clair_; and the fourth, _Hawthornden_, the\r\n     residence of the elegant and plaintive Drummond; with whose\r\n     beautiful Sonnet, to this his romantic habitation, the\r\n     volume closes:\r\n\r\n          \"Dear wood! and you, sweet solitary place,\r\n          Where I estranged from the vulgar live,\" &c.\r\n\r\n     Of the volume which had been thus described, only 120 copies\r\n     were printed. The Views were all drawn and etched by her\r\n     Ladyship: and are executed with a spirit and correctness\r\n     which would have done credit to the most successful disciple\r\n     of Rembrandt. A copy of the work, which had been presented\r\n     to the late Right Hon. C.F. Greville, produced, at the sale\r\n     of his books, the sum of sixteen guineas.]\r\n\r\nLIS.

The body of the work,\r\n     which is printed in a smaller type, occupies 126 double\r\n     pages; on account of the Latin and English being on the\r\n     opposite pages, each page is marked with the same number.\r\n     Only 220 copies of this curious and elegant work were\r\n     printed.--III. _Fugitive Pieces in Verse and Prose.

Seven hundred copies of it were\r\n     printed; and from a copy, originally in the possession of\r\n     the late Mr. John Mann, of Durham, I learnt that \"the clear\r\n     profits arising from the sale of it being about 300_l._,\r\n     were applied for the benefit of Mr. Hill and his family.\"\r\n     (Magliabechi was \"the man of Florence;\" and Hill \"the one\r\n     scarce ever heard of in England.\") A copy of this edition,\r\n     with MS. notes by Mr. Cole, was purchased by Mr. Waldron, at\r\n     the sale of George Steevens's books, for 3_l._6_s._ It was\r\n     reprinted by Dodsley: but the curious seek only the present\r\n     edition.----VI. _Lucani Pharsalia_, MDCCLX, 4to.

After this, there should be a\r\n     \"Genealogical Table of the family of Herbert,\" which is very\r\n     scarce, on account of its being suppressed by Mr. Walpole,\r\n     for its inaccuracy. The life occupied 171 pages. \"Mr.\r\n     Walpole,\" says the late Mr. Cole, \"when I was with him in\r\n     the autumn of 1763, at which time the book was partly\r\n     printed, told me that either one or two hundred copies were\r\n     to be printed; half to be sent to the Earl of Powis, and the\r\n     other half he was to reserve for himself, as presents to his\r\n     friends; so that, except the book is reprinted by some\r\n     bookseller, privately, as probably it will, it will be a\r\n     curiosity. It was not published till the end of June, 1764,\r\n     when the honourable editor sent it to me.----IX. _Poems by\r\n     Anna Chambers_, Countess Temple. MDCCLXIV, 4to. This volume,\r\n     containing 13 poems on various subjects, is printed in 34\r\n     pages, with a large, but not very elegant type. Only 100\r\n     copies were struck off.----X. _The Mysterious Mother._ A\r\n     Tragedy, by Mr. Horace Walpole. Sit mihi fas audita loqui.\r\n     Virg. Printed at S.H., MDCCLXVIII. 8vo. No vignette on the\r\n     back. First leaf, errata, and \"persons\" [of the play.]\r\n     Printed with the small type on 120 pages; after which\r\n     follows a \"postscript\" of 10 pages. Only 50 copies printed.\r\n     An uncut copy was recently sold for 6_l._ 15_s._----XI.\r\n     _Cornélie vestale. Tragédie._ Imprimée à S.H. MDCCLXVIII,\r\n     8vo., 200 copies. The title-page is followed by a letter \"a\r\n     Mons. Horace Walpole.\" A page of the names of the actors\r\n     forms the commencement of the work, which contains 91 pages,\r\n     neatly printed. Only 200 copies printed, of which 150 were\r\n     sent to Paris.----XII. _Poems by the Reverend Mr. Hoyland_,\r\n     MDCCLXIX, 8vo. The advertisement ends at p. iv.; the odes\r\n     occupy 19 pages. Although this little volume is not printed\r\n     with the usual elegance of the S.H. press, it is valuable\r\n     from its scarcity, on account of its never having been\r\n     re-printed. Only 300 copies were struck off.----XIII.\r\n     _Original Letters from K. Edward VI. to Barnaby\r\n     Fitzpatrick_, 1772, 4to. I am not acquainted with any\r\n     circumstance, intrinsic or extrinsic, that renders this\r\n     small volume sought after.----XIV. _Miscellaneous\r\n     Antiquities, or a collection of curious papers_: either\r\n     republished from scarce tracts, or now first printed from\r\n     original MSS. Two numbers printed by Thomas Kirgate,\r\n     MDCCLXXII, 4to. No. I. Advertisement of two pages, ending p.\r\n     iv. The number contains besides: CONTENTS. Chap. I. \"An\r\n     account of some Tournaments and other martial Diversions.\"\r\n     This was reprinted from a work written by Sir William Segar,\r\n     Norroy; and is called by the author, Honour, Military and\r\n     Ceuill, printed at London in 1602. Chap. II. Of \"Justs and\r\n     Tournaments,\" &c., from the same. Chap. III. \"A Triumph in\r\n     the Reigne of King Richard the Second, 1390,\" from the same.\r\n     Chap. IV. \"A Militarie Triumph at Brussels, Anno 1549,\" from\r\n     the same. Chap. V. \"Of Justs and Tourneaments,\" &c., from\r\n     the same. Chap. VI. \"Triumphes Military, for honour and loue\r\n     of Ladies: brought before the Kings of England,\" from the\r\n     same. Chap. VII. \"Of the life and actions in Armes since the\r\n     reigne of Queene Elizabeth,\" from the same. Chap. VIII. \"The\r\n     original occasions of the yeerely Triumph in England.\" All\r\n     these tracts are taken from the above work. No. II. Second\r\n     leaf, a plate of a head from the original wood-cut by Hans\r\n     Holbein. CONTENTS. This number is almost entirely occupied\r\n     by the \"Life of Sir Thomas Wyat, the elder,\" copied by Mr.\r\n     Gray from the originals in the Harleian Collection, now in\r\n     the British Museum. This extends to p. 54, after which is an\r\n     Appendix of eight pages on a few miscellaneous subjects.\r\n     Five hundred copies were printed.----XV. _Memoirs du Comte\r\n     de Grammont_, par Monsieur le Comte Antoine Hamilton.\r\n     Nouvelle edition, Augumentée denotes et eclaircissemens\r\n     necessaires. Par M. HORACE WALPOLE. MDCCLXXII, 4to. The\r\n     title-page is succeeded by a dedication \"à Madame ----,\" in\r\n     six lines and a half, printed in a very large type. Then\r\n     follows an \"Avis de L'Editour,\" and \"Avertissement,\"\r\n     occupying three pages. An \"Epitre à Monsieur le Comte de\r\n     Grammont,' continues to p. xxi: then a \"Table des\r\n     Chapitres,\" to p. xxiii., on the back of which are the\r\n     errata. The body of the work extends to 290 pages; which are\r\n     succeeded by \"Table des Personnes,\" or index, in three\r\n     pages. These memoirs are printed with the middle size type;\r\n     but neither the type nor paper are so beautiful as are those\r\n     of Hentzner's Travels, or the comparison between Magliabechi\r\n     and Hill. PORTRAITS. 1. Le Comte Antoine Hamilton, faces the\r\n     title page. 2. Philibert, Comte de Grammont, opposite the\r\n     \"Epitre:\" badly executed. 3. A portrait of Miss Warminster,\r\n     opposite p. 85, in the style of Worlidge's gems. 4.\r\n     Mademoiselle d'Hamilton, Comtesse de Grammont, faces p. 92.\r\n     This engraving, by G. Powle, is executed in a style of\r\n     beauty and spirit that has seldom been surpassed. 5. Lord\r\n     Chesterfield, second Earl, in the style of the preceding;\r\n     very beautiful. There were only 100 copies of this edition\r\n     printed, of which 30 were sent as presents to Paris.----XVI.\r\n     _The Sleep Walker, a Comedy_: in two acts. Translated [by\r\n     Lady Craven] from the French, in March. Printed by T.\r\n     Kirgate, MDCCLXXVIII, 8vo. It is printed in the small type\r\n     on 56 pages, exclusively of viii. introductory ones, of\r\n     \"prologues\" and \"persons,\" &c. Only 75 copies were printed:\r\n     and of these, one was sold for 4_l._ in the year 1804, at a\r\n     public auction.----XVII. _A Letter to the Editor of the\r\n     Miscellanies of Thomas Chatterton._ Printed by T. Kirgate.\r\n     MDCCLXXIX, 8vo. This title is preceded by what is called a\r\n     bastard title: and is followed by 55 pages of the work, not\r\n     very elegantly printed. Only 200 copies.----XVIII. _The Muse\r\n     Recalled_, an ode occasioned by the nuptials of Lord\r\n     Viscount Althorp (the late Earl Spencer) and Miss Lavinia\r\n     Bingham, eldest daughter of Charles, Lord Lucan, March vi.,\r\n     MDCCLXXXI. By William Jones, Esq. Printed by Thomas Kirgate,\r\n     MDCCLXXXI. 4to. Eight pages, exclusively of the title-page.\r\n     Printed in the middle size type; but neither the paper nor\r\n     typographical execution are in the best style of the S.H.\r\n     press. Only 250 copies printed.----XIX. _A Description of\r\n     the Villa of Mr. Horace Walpole, youngest son of Sir Robert\r\n     Walpole, Earl of Orford, at Strawberry Hill, near\r\n     Twickenham, Middlesex._ With an inventory of the Furniture,\r\n     Pictures, Curiosities, &c. Printed by Thomas Kirgate,\r\n     MCCLXXXIV, 4to. This book contains 96 pages in the whole. It\r\n     was preceded by a small quarto impression of MDCCLXXIV:\r\n     which is scarce; and of which there are large paper copies.\r\n     The work entitled _Ædes Walpolianæ_ was printed in\r\n     MDCCLXVII.\r\n\r\n     Plates to the edition of 1784.\r\n\r\n      1. Frontispiece, Gothic; motto on a scroll, \"Fari quæ\r\n         sentiat.\"\r\n      2. North Front of Strawberry Hill.\r\n      3. Entrance of Strawberry Hill.\r\n      4.

The Shell Bench.\r\n     19. View from the Terrace at Strawberry Hill.\r\n     20. East View of the Cottage Garden at Strawberry Hill. There\r\n         were only 200 copies of this edition printed.\r\n\r\n     The following may amuse the curious reader:\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Walpole is very ready to oblige any curious persons with\r\n     the sight of his house and collection; but as it is situated\r\n     so near to London, and in so populous a neighbourhood, and as\r\n     he refuses a ticket to nobody that sends for one, it is but\r\n     reasonable that such persons as send should comply with the\r\n     rules he has been obliged to lay down for shewing it:--Any\r\n     person, sending a day or two before may have a ticket for\r\n     four persons for a day certain;--No Ticket will serve but on\r\n     the day for which it is given. If more than four persons come\r\n     with a ticket, the housekeeper has positive orders to admit\r\n     none of them;--Every ticket will admit the company only\r\n     between the hours of twelve and three before dinner, and only\r\n     one company will be admitted on the same day;--The house will\r\n     never be shewn after dinner, nor at all but from the first of\r\n     May to the first of October;--As Mr. Walpole has given\r\n     offence by sometimes enlarging the number o [Transcriber's\r\n     Note: of] four, and refusing that latitude to others, he\r\n     flatters himself that for the future nobody will take it ill\r\n     that he strictly confines the number; as whoever desires him\r\n     to break his rule does in effect expect him to disoblige\r\n     others, which is what nobody has a right to desire of\r\n     him;--Persons desiring a ticket may apply either to\r\n     Strawberry Hill, or to Mr. Walpole's, in Berkeley Square,\r\n     London. If any person does not make use of the ticket, Mr.\r\n     Walpole hopes he shall have notice: otherwise he is prevented\r\n     from obliging others on that day, and thence is put to great\r\n     inconvenience;--They who have tickets are desired not to\r\n     bring children.\"----XX. _A copy of all the Works of Mr.\r\n     Walpole that were printed by him before his death_, 1784,\r\n     4to. This brochure, which has been called \"rare\" in\r\n     book-auction catalogues, has been sold for upwards of two\r\n     guineas.----XXI. _Postscript to the Royal and Noble Authors._\r\n     MDCCXXXVI, 8vo. There should be, before the title-page, an\r\n     outline etching of \"Reason, Rectitude, and Justice, appearing\r\n     to Christin de Pisan, &c., from an illumination in the\r\n     library of the King of France,\" which is exceedingly well\r\n     engraved. The work contains only 18 pages: and there were but\r\n     40 copies printed. The _Royal and Noble Authors_ were first\r\n     printed in 1759, 8vo. 2 vols.----XXII. _Essai sur l'Art des\r\n     Jardins Modernes_, par M. Horace Walpole. Traduit en\r\n     François, par M. Le Duc de Nivernois, en MDCCLXXXIV. _Imprimé\r\n     à S.H._ par T. Kirgate, MDCCLXXXV. With an opposite title in\r\n     English, 4to. It contains 94 double pages, and every page of\r\n     French has an opposite one of English. Not printed in the\r\n     best manner of S.H. A copy of this book was sold for 3_l._;\r\n     at a sale in 1804.----XXIII. _Bishop Banner's Ghost._ Printed\r\n     by T.K. MDLCCXXXIX, 4to. On the first leaf is the following\r\n     \"Argument.\" \"In the gardens of the palace of Fulham is a dark\r\n     recess: at the end of this stands a chair, which once\r\n     belonged to Bishop Bonner. A certain Bishop of London (the\r\n     late Beilby Porteus) more than 200 years after the death of\r\n     the aforesaid Bonner, just as the clock of the gothic chapel\r\n     had struck six, undertook to cut, with his own hand, a narrow\r\n     walk through this thicket, which is since called the _Monk's\r\n     walk_. He had no sooner begun to clear the way, than lo!\r\n     suddenly up started from the chair, the ghost of Bishop\r\n     Bonner, who, in a tone of just and bitter indignation,\r\n     uttered the following verses.\" This curious publication\r\n     contains only four pages of stanzas, written in alternate\r\n     rhyme, of 8 and 6 feet metre.----XXIV. _The Magpie and her\r\n     Brood_; a fable, from the tales of Bonaventure de Periers,\r\n     valet de chambre to the Queen of Navarre; addressed to Miss\r\n     Hotham. This is a very scarce poetical tract of four pages\r\n     only; subscribed H.W.----XXV. _Fourteen different pieces,\r\n     printed at Strawberry Hill, of verses, cards, &c._ This title\r\n     I borrow from a book-auction catalogue. At a sale in 1804,\r\n     these detached pieces were sold for 2_l._ 2_s._; but it is\r\n     not in my power to identify them. Whether they be the same\r\n     \"_parcel of scraps, and loose leaves of poetry, epigrams_,\"\r\n     _&c._ which, according to a daily newspaper, were sold at the\r\n     commencement of this year \"for 16 pounds,\" I am also equally\r\n     ignorant. See _Kirgate's Catalogue_, 1810, no. 420.----XXVI.\r\n     _Hieroglyphic Tales_, 8vo. Only seven copies printed; _idem_,\r\n     no. 380. From newspaper authority, I learn that these tales\r\n     formed \"a small pamphlet of two sheets, crown 8vo.,\" which\r\n     were sold for 16_l._; and I understand that the late Mr. G.\r\n     Baker was the purchaser. N.B. They are incorporated in the\r\n     author's printed works; but this is not having the _first_\r\n     and _true edition_! There is nothing like the comfort of\r\n     bleeding smartly for exhibiting these fourth and fifth\r\n     symptoms of the Bibliomania!

We will now take leave of the PRELUM\r\n     WALPOLIANUM by subjoining a copy of the most elegant\r\n     title-page vignette which ever issued from it.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: FARI QUÆ SENTIAT]\r\n\r\n     Before the reader's eyes are finally turned from a\r\n     contemplation of this elegant device--and as connected with\r\n     the subject of PRIVATE PRESSES--let me inform him that the\r\n     Marquis of Bute is in possession of a thin folio volume,\r\n     exhibiting paintings, upon vellum, of the various devices\r\n     used by Pope Sixtus V., in the frontispieces of the several\r\n     works which issued from the APOSTOLICAL PRESS, while he\r\n     filled the Papal Chair. To a tasteful bibliomaniac, few\r\n     volumes would afford so much delight as a contemplation of\r\n     the present one. It is quite a _keimelion_ in its way!]\r\n\r\nLYSAND. I do; but I have not so ardent an admiration of these\r\nvolumes, as the generality of collectors. On the contrary, I think\r\nthat the _Hafod Press_ has, by one single production only, outweighed\r\nthe whole of the _Walpolian_ lucubrations; at least on the score of\r\nutility.\r\n\r\nI might here add, to the foregoing symptoms, a passion to possess\r\nworks which have been _suppressed_, _condemned_, or _burnt_; but all\r\nthese things rank under the head of _causes of the rarity_ of books;\r\nand as an entire volume might be written upon _this_ symptom _alone_,\r\nI can here only allude to to [Transcriber's Note: second 'to'\r\nerroneous] the subject; hoping some diligent bibliographer will one\r\nday do for _us_ what foreigners have done for other nations.\r\n\r\nThus have I, rather slightly, discussed the _Symptoms of the Disease,\r\ncalled_ =The Bibliomania=. During this discussion, I see our friend has\r\nbeen busy, as he was yesterday evening, in making sketches of notes;\r\nand if you examine the finished pictures of which such outlines may be\r\nmade productive, you will probably have a better notion of the\r\naccuracy of my classification of these symptoms.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be wished, whatever may be the whims of desperate\r\nbook-collectors, that, in _some_ of those volumes which are constantly\r\ncirculating in the bibliomaniacal market, we had a more clear and\r\nsatisfactory account of the rise and progress of arts and sciences.\r\nHowever strong may be my attachment to the profession of the cloth, I\r\ncould readily exchange a great number of old volumes of polemical and\r\nhortatory divinity for interesting disquisitions upon the manners,\r\ncustoms, and general history of the times. Over what a dark and\r\ntroublesome ocean must we sail, before we get even a glimpse at the\r\nprogressive improvement of our ancestors in civilised life! Oh, that\r\nsome judicious and faithful reporter had lived three hundred and odd\r\nyears ago!--we might then have had a more satisfactory account of the\r\n_origin of printing with metal types_.\r\n\r\nLIS. Pray give us your sentiments upon this latter subject. We have\r\nalmost the whole day before us:--the sun has hardly begun to decline\r\nfrom his highest point.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. A very pretty and smooth subject to discuss, truly! The\r\nlongest day and the most effectually-renovated powers of body and\r\nmind, are hardly sufficient to come to any satisfactory conclusion,\r\nupon the subject. How can I, therefore, after the fatigues of the\r\nwhole of yesterday, and with barely seven hours of daylight yet to\r\nfollow, pretend to enter upon it? No: I will here only barely mention\r\nTRITHEMIUS[458]--who might have been numbered among the patriarchal\r\nbibliographers we noticed when discoursing in our friend's CABINET--as\r\nan author from whom considerable assistance has been received\r\nrespecting early typographical researches. Indeed, Trithemius merits a\r\nmore marked distinction in the annals of Literature than many are\r\nsupposed to grant him: at any rate, I wish his labours were better\r\nknown to our own countrymen.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 458: We are indebted to the Abbé TRITHEMIUS, who\r\n     was a diligent chronicler and indefatigable visitor of old\r\n     Libraries, for a good deal of curious and interesting\r\n     intelligence; and however Scioppius (_De Orig. Domûs\r\n     Austriac._), Brower (_Vit. Fortunat. Pictav._, p. 18.), and\r\n     Possevinus (_Apparant sacr._ p. 945), may carp at his\r\n     simplicity and want of judgment, yet, as Baillet (from whom\r\n     I have borrowed the foregoing authorities) has justly\r\n     remarked--\"since the time of Trithemius there have been many\r\n     libraries, particularly in Germany, which have been pillaged\r\n     or burnt in the destruction of monasteries; so that the\r\n     books which he describes as having seen in many places,\r\n     purposely visited by him for inspection, may have been\r\n     destroyed in the conflagration of religious houses.\"\r\n     _Jugemens des Savans_; vol. ii., pt. i., p. 71, edit. 12mo.\r\n     It is from Trithemius, after all, that we have the only\r\n     _direct_ evidence concerning the origin of printing with\r\n     metal types: and the bibliographical world is much indebted\r\n     to Chevelier (_L'Origine de l'Imprimerie de Paris_, 1691,\r\n     4to., pp. 3-6.) for having been the first to adduce the\r\n     positive evidence of this writer; who tells us, in his\r\n     valuable _Chronicon Hirsaugiens_ (1690, 2 vols. folio), that\r\n     he received his testimony from the mouth of Fust's\r\n     son-in-law--\"ex ore Petri Opilionis audivi,\"--that\r\n     Guttenburg [Transcriber's Note: Gutenberg] was the author of\r\n     the invention. The historical works of Trithemius were\r\n     collected and published in 1601, in folio, two parts, and\r\n     his other works are minutely detailed in the 9th volume of\r\n     the _Dictionnarie [Transcriber's Note: Dictionnaire]\r\n     Historique_, published at Caen, in 1789. Of these, one of\r\n     the most curious is his _Polygraphia_: being first printed\r\n     at Paris, in 1518, in a beautiful folio volume; and\r\n     presenting us, in the frontispiece, with a portrait of the\r\n     abbé; which is probably the first, if not the only\r\n     legitimate, print of him extant. Whether it be copied from a\r\n     figure on his tomb--as it has a good deal of the\r\n     _monumental_ character--I have no means of ascertaining. For\r\n     the gratification of all tasteful bibliomaniacs, an\r\n     admirable facsimile is here annexed. The _Polygraphia_ of\r\n     Trithemius was translated into French, and published in\r\n     1601, folio. His work _De Scriptoribus Ecclesiasticis_,\r\n     Colon, 1546, 4to., with two appendices, contains much\r\n     valuable matter. The author died in his 55th year, A.D.\r\n     1516: according to the inscription upon his tomb in the\r\n     monastery of the Benedictines at Wirtzburg. His life has\r\n     been written by Busæus, a Jesuit. See La Monnoye's note in\r\n     the _Jugemens des Savans_; _ibid._\r\n\r\n     [Illustration]]\r\n\r\nLIS. I will set his works down among my literary _desiderata_. But\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. With what? Am I to talk for ever?\r\n\r\nBELIN. While you discourse so much to the purpose, you may surely not\r\nobject to a continuance of this conversation. I wish only to be\r\ninformed whether bibliomaniacs are indisputably known by the\r\nprevalence of all, or of any, of the symptoms which you have just\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nALMAN. Is there any other passion, or fancy, in the book-way, from\r\nwhich we may judge of Bibliomaniacism?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Let me consider. Yes; there is one other characteristic of the\r\nbook-madman that may as well be noticed. It is an ardent desire to\r\ncollect ALL THE EDITIONS of a work which have been published. Not only\r\nthe FIRST--whether _uncut, upon large paper_, _in the black-letter_,\r\n_unique_, _tall_, or _illustrated_--but ALL the editions.[459]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 459: I frankly confess that I was, myself, once\r\n     desperately afflicted with this _eleventh_ symptom of _The\r\n     Bibliomania_; having collected not fewer than _seventy-five_\r\n     editions of the GREEK TESTAMENT--but time has cooled my\r\n     ardour, and mended my judgment. I have discarded seventy,\r\n     and retain only five: which are _R. Steevens's_ of 1550,\r\n     _The Elzevir_ of 1624, _Mill's_ of 1707, _Westein's_ of\r\n     1751, and _Griesbach's_ of 1810--as beautifully and\r\n     accurately reprinted at Oxford.]\r\n\r\nBELIN. Strange--but true, I warrant!\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Most true; but, in my humble opinion, most ridiculous; for\r\nwhat can a sensible man desire beyond the earliest and best editions\r\nof a work?\r\n\r\nBe it also noticed that these works are sometimes very capricious and\r\nextroardinary [Transcriber's Note: extraordinary]. Thus, BAPTISTA is\r\nwretched unless he possess every edition of our early grammarians,\r\n_Holt_, _Stanbridge_, and _Whittinton_: a reimpression, or a new\r\nedition, is a matter of almost equal indifference: for his slumbers\r\nare broken and oppressive unless _all_ the _dear Wynkyns_ and\r\n_Pynsons_ are found within his closet!--Up starts FLORIZEL, and blows\r\nhis bugle, at the annunciation of any work, new or old, upon the\r\ndiversions of _Hawking_, _Hunting_, or _Fishing_![460] Carry him\r\nthrough CAMILLO'S cabinet of Dutch pictures, and you will see how\r\ninstinctively, as it were, his eyes are fixed upon a sporting piece by\r\nWouvermans. The hooded hawk, in his estimation, hath more charms than\r\nGuido's Madonna:--how he envies every rider upon his white horse!--how\r\nhe burns to bestride the foremost steed, and to mingle in the fair\r\nthrong, who turn their blue eyes to the scarcely bluer expanse of\r\nheaven! Here he recognises _Gervase Markham_, spurring his courser;\r\nand there he fancies himself lifting _Dame Juliana_ from her horse!\r\nHappy deception! dear fiction! says Florizel--while he throws his eyes\r\nin an opposite direction, and views every printed book upon the\r\nsubject, from _Barnes_ to _Thornton_.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 460: Some superficial notes, accompanied by an\r\n     interesting wood-cut of a man carrying hawks for sale, in my\r\n     edition of Robinson's translation of _More's Utopia_,\r\n     kindled, in the breast of Mr. Joseph Haslewood, a prodigious\r\n     ardour to pursue the subjects above-mentioned to their\r\n     farthest possible limits. Not Eolus himself excited greater\r\n     commotion in the Mediterranean waves than did my\r\n     bibliomaniacal friend in agitating the black-letter\r\n     ocean--'a sedibus imis'--for the discovering of every volume\r\n     which had been published upon these delectable pursuits.\r\n     Accordingly there appeared in due time--'[post] magni\r\n     procedere menses'--some very ingenious and elaborate\r\n     disquisitions upon Hunting and Hawking and Fishing, in the\r\n     ninth and tenth volumes of _The Censura Literaria_; which,\r\n     with such additions as his enlarged experience has\r\n     subsequently obtained, might be thought an interesting work\r\n     if reprinted in a duodecimo volume. But Mr. Haslewood's\r\n     mind, as was to be expected, could not rest satisfied with\r\n     what he considered as mere _nuclei_ productions:\r\n     accordingly, it became clothed with larger wings, and\r\n     meditated a bolder flight; and after soaring in a\r\n     _hawk_-like manner, to mark the object of its prey, it\r\n     pounced upon the book of _Hawking, Hunting, Fishing, &c._,\r\n     which had been reprinted by W. de Worde, from the original\r\n     edition published in the abbey of St. Albans. Prefixed to\r\n     the republication of this curious volume, the reader will\r\n     discover a great deal of laborious and successful research\r\n     connected with the book and its author. And yet I question\r\n     whether, in the midst of all the wood-cuts with which it\r\n     abounds, there be found any thing more suitable to the 'high\r\n     and mounting spirit' (see Braithwait's amusing discourse\r\n     upon Hawking, in his _English Gentleman_, p. 200-1.) of the\r\n     editor's taste, than the ensuing representation of a pilgrim\r\n     Hawker?!--taken from one of the frontispieces of _L'Acadamia\r\n     Peregrina del Doni_; 1552, 4to., fol. 73.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration]\r\n\r\n     We will conclude this _Hawking_ note with the following\r\n     excerpt from one of the earliest editions of the abridgment\r\n     of our statutes:--'nul home pringe les oves dascu[n]\r\n     _faucon_, _goshawke_, _lan_, ou swan hors de le nyst sur\r\n     peyn de inprison p[our] vn an et vn iour et de faire fyn all\r\n     volunte le roy et que nul home puis le fest de paque\r\n     p[ro]chyn auenpart ascun _hawke_ de le brode dengl' appell\r\n     vne _nyesse_, _goshawke_, _lan_, ou _laneret_ sur sa mayn,\r\n     sur peyn de forfaiture son _hawke_, et que null enchasse\r\n     ascun hawke hors de c[ou]uerte sur peyne de forfaiture x li.\r\n     lun moyte al roy et lauter a celuy que voet sur.'

Restrain your wild feelings--listen to the sober satire of\r\nLysander. Have you nothing else, in closing this symptomatic subject,\r\nto discourse upon?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. There is certainly another point not very remotely connected\r\nwith the two preceding; and it is this: a passion to possess large and\r\nvoluminous works, and to estimate the treasures of our libraries\r\nrather by their extent and splendour than by their intrinsic worth:\r\nforgetting how prettily Ronsard[463] has illustrated this subject by\r\nthe utility and beauty of small rivers in comparison with those which\r\noverflow their banks and spread destruction around. \"Oh combien (says\r\nCailleau, in his _Roman Bibliographique_) un petit livre bien pensé,\r\nbein [Transcriber's Note: bien] plein, et bein [Transcriber's Note:\r\nbien] écrit, est plus agréable, plus utile à lire, que ces vastes\r\ncompilations à la formation desquelles l'intérêt a présidé plus\r\nsouvent que le bon-goût!\"\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 463:\r\n\r\n          Ie te confesse bien que le fleuve de Seine\r\n          A le cours grand et long, mais tousiours il attraine\r\n          Avec soy de la fange, et ses plis recourbrez,\r\n          Sans estre iamais nets, sont tousiours embourbez:\r\n          Vn petit ruisselet a tousiours l'onde nette,\r\n          Aussi le papillon et la gentille auette\r\n          Y vont puiser de l'eau, et non en ces torrens\r\n          Qui tonnent d'vn grand bruit pas les roches courant:\r\n          Petit Sonnets bien faits, belles chansons petites,\r\n          Petits discourds gentils, sont les fleurs des Charites,\r\n          Des Soeurs et d'Apollon, qui ne daignent aymer\r\n          Ceux qui chantent une oeuvre aussi grand que la mer,\r\n          Sans riue ny sans fond, de tempestes armée\r\n          Et qui iamais ne dort tranquille ny calmée.\r\n\r\n          _Poems de Ronsard_; fol. 171. Paris 1660. 12mo.\r\n\r\n     These are pretty lines, and have a melodious flow; but\r\n     Ronsard, in his 8 and 9 feet metres, is one of the most\r\n     fascinating of the old French poets. The subject, above\r\n     alluded to by Lysander, may be yet more strongly\r\n     illustrated: for thus speaks Spizelius upon it. 'Solent viri\r\n     multijugæ lectionis, qui avidè, quos possunt versant libros,\r\n     ut in mentis ventrem trajicere eos velle, totosque devorare\r\n     videantur, elegantis proverbii salivâ LIBRORUM HELLUONES\r\n     nuncupari; ipso quidem Tullio prælucente, qui avidos\r\n     lectores librorum, ac propemodum insiatiables Helluones\r\n     dixit, siquidem _vastissima volumina_ percurrant, et\r\n     quicquid boni succi exprimere possunt, propriis et alienis\r\n     impendant emolumentis.\" Again: \"Maxima cum sit eorum\r\n     Literarum stoliditas, qui, quod nocte somniarunt, continuo\r\n     edunt in lucem, neque ipsa virium imbecillitate suarum, ab\r\n     arduo scribendi munere et onere, sese revocari patiuntur,\"\r\n     &c. _Infelix Literatus_; pp. 295, 447. Morof is worth our\r\n     notice upon this subject: \"Veniamus ad Bibliothecas ipsas,\r\n     quales vel privatæ sunt, vel publicæ. Illæ, quanquam in\r\n     molem tantam non excrescant ut publicæ; sunt tamen etiam\r\n     inter privatos viri illustres et opulenti qui in libris\r\n     omnis generis coemendis nullis parcunt sumptibus.

Well; we live in a marvellous book-collecting and book-reading\r\nage--yet a word more:\r\n\r\nALMAN. I crave your pardon, Belinda; but I have a thought which must\r\nbe now imparted, or the consequence may be serious.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. I wait both your commands.\r\n\r\nALMAN. My thought--or rather the subject which now occupies my\r\nmind--is this: You have told us of the symptoms of the _Disease of\r\nBook-Madness_, now pray inform us, as a tender-hearted physician, what\r\nare the _means of its cure_?\r\n\r\nBELIN. The very question I was about to put to our bibliomaniacal\r\nphysician. Pray inform us what are the means of cure in this disorder?\r\n\r\nLYSAND. You should say PROBABLE MEANS OF CURE, as I verily believe\r\nthere are no certain and correct remedies.\r\n\r\nBELIN. Well, Sir, _probable_ means--if it must be so. Discourse\r\nlargely and distinctly upon these.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Briefly and perspicuously, if you please: and thus we begin.\r\n\r\nIn the _first place_, the disease of the Bibliomania is materially\r\nsoftened, or rendered mild, by directing our studies to _useful_ and\r\n_profitable_ works; whether these be printed upon small or large\r\npaper, in the gothic, roman, or italic type. To consider merely the\r\n_intrinsic excellence_, and not the _exterior splendour_, or\r\nadventitious value, of any production will keep us perhaps wholly free\r\nfrom this disease. Let the midnight lamp be burnt to illuminate the\r\nstores of antiquity--whether they be romances, or chronicles, or\r\nlegends, and whether they be printed by ALDUS or CAXTON--if a brighter\r\nlustre can thence be thrown upon the pages of modern learning! To\r\ntrace genius to its source, or to see how she has been influenced or\r\nmodified by the lore of past times, is both a pleasing and profitable\r\npursuit. To see how Shakspeare, here and there, has plucked a flower\r\nfrom some old ballad or popular tale, to enrich his own unperishable\r\ngarland;--to follow Spenser and Milton in their delightful labyrinths\r\n'midst the splendour of Italian literature; are studies which stamp a\r\ndignity upon our intellectual characters! But, in such a pursuit, let\r\nus not overlook the wisdom of modern times, nor fancy that what is\r\nonly ancient can be excellent. We must remember that Bacon, Boyle,\r\nLocke, Taylor, Chillingworth, Robertson, Hume, Gibbon, and Paley, are\r\nnames which always command attention from the wise, and remind us of\r\nthe improved state of reason and acquired knowledge during the two\r\nlast centuries.\r\n\r\nALMAN. There seems at least sound sense, with the prospect of much\r\nfuture good, in this _first_ recipe. What is your second.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. In the _second place_, the reprinting of scarce and\r\nintrinsically valuable works is another means of preventing the\r\npropagation of this disorder. Amidst all our present sufferings under\r\nthe BIBLIOMANIA, it is some consolation to find discerning and\r\nspirited booksellers republishing the ancient Chroniclers; and the\r\ncollections known by the names of \"_The Harleian Miscellany_\" and\r\n\"_Lord Somers' Tracts_,\" and \"_The Voyages of Hakluyt_.\"[464] These\r\nare noble efforts, and richly deserve the public patronage.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 464: In the _Quarterly Review_ for August, 1810,\r\n     this my second remedy for curing the disease of the\r\n     Bibliomania is considered as inefficient. I have a great\r\n     respect for this Review, but I understand neither the\r\n     premises nor conclusions therein laid down concerning the\r\n     subject in discussion. If \"those who cannot afford to\r\n     purchase original publications must be content with entire\r\n     reprints of them\" (I give the very words, though not the\r\n     entire sentence), it surely tends to lessen the degree of\r\n     competition for \"the original publication.\" A sober reader,\r\n     or an economical book-buyer, wants a certain tract on the\r\n     ground of its utility:--but take my own case--who have very\r\n     few hundreds per annum to procure food for the body as well\r\n     as the mind. I wish to consult Roy's tract of \"Rede me and\r\n     be not wroth,\" (vide p. 226, ante)--or the \"Expedition into\r\n     Scotland\" of 1544 (see Mr. Beloe's _Anecdotes of Literature\r\n     and Scarce Books_, vol. ii., p. 345), because these are\r\n     really interesting, as well as rare, volumes. There is at\r\n     present no reprint of either; and can I afford to bid ten or\r\n     twelve guineas for each of them at a public book-sale?\r\n     But--let them be faithfully _reprinted_, and even a golden\r\n     guinea (if such a coin be now in the pocket of a poor\r\n     bibliomaniac like myself) would be considered by me as\r\n     _dear_ terms upon which to purchase the _original_ edition!\r\n     The reviewer has illustrated his position by a model of the\r\n     Pigot diamond; and intimates that this model does not\r\n     \"lessen the public desire to possess the original.\" Lord\r\n     Mansfield once observed that nothing more frequently tended\r\n     to perplex an argument than a simile--(the remark is\r\n     somewhere in _Burrows's Reports_); and the judge's dictum\r\n     seems here a little verified. If the glass or crystal model\r\n     could reflect _all the lustre_ of the original, it would be\r\n     of equal utility; but it cannot. Now the reprint _does_\r\n     impart _all_ the intelligence and intrinsic worth of the\r\n     original (for \"the ugliness of the types\" cannot be thought\r\n     worthy of aiding the argument one way or another) therefore\r\n     the reprint of Roy's poetical tract is not illustrated by\r\n     the model of the Pigot diamond: which latter cannot impart\r\n     the intrinsic value of the original. Let us now say a word\r\n     about the _Reprints_ above commended by Lysander. When Mr.\r\n     Harding went to press with the first volume of the _Harleian\r\n     Miscellany_, his zeal struggled with his prudence about the\r\n     number of copies to be printed of so voluminous a work.\r\n     Accordingly, he ventured upon only 250 copies. As the work\r\n     advanced, (and, I would hope, as the recommendation of it,\r\n     in the last edition of the Bibliomania, promoted its sale)\r\n     he took courage, and struck off another 250 copies of the\r\n     earlier volumes: and thus this magnificent reprint (which\r\n     will be followed up by two volumes of additional matter\r\n     collected by Mr. Park, its editor) may be pronounced a\r\n     profitable, as well as generally serviceable, publication to\r\n     the cause of Literature. The original edition of _Lord\r\n     Somers' Tracts_ having become exceedingly scarce, and the\r\n     arrangement of them being equally confused, three spirited\r\n     booksellers, under the editorial inspection of Mr. Walter\r\n     Scott, are putting forth a correct, well arranged, and\r\n     beautiful reprint of the same invaluable work. Five volumes\r\n     are already published. _The Voyages of Hakluyt_ are\r\n     republishing by Mr. Evans, of Pall Mall. Four volumes are\r\n     already before the public; of which only 250 copies of the\r\n     small, and 75 of the large, are printed. The reprint will\r\n     contain the whole of Hakluyt, with the addition of several\r\n     scarce voyages and travels.]\r\n\r\nLOREN. I fully coincide with these sentiments; and, as a proof of it,\r\nregularly order my London bookseller to transmit to me every volume of\r\nthe reprint of these excellent works as it is published.\r\n\r\nBELIN. Can you find it in your heart, dear brother, to part with your\r\nblack-letter Chronicles, and Hakluyt's Voyages, for these new\r\npublications?\r\n\r\nLOREN. I keep the best editions of the ancient Chronicles; but the new\r\nFabian, the Harleian Miscellany, Lord Somers' Tracts, and the Voyages,\r\nare unquestionably to be preferred; since they are more full and\r\ncomplete. But proceed with your other probable means of cure.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. In the _third place_, the editing of our best ancient authors,\r\nwhether in prose or poetry,[465] is another means of effectually\r\ncounteracting the mischievous effects arising from the bibliomaniacal\r\ndisease; and, on this score, I do think this country stands\r\npre-eminently conspicuous; for we are indefatigable in our attentions\r\ntowards restoring the corrupted texts of our poets.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 465: The last new editions of our standard\r\n     belles-lettres writers are the following: which should be\r\n     found in every gentleman's library. _Shakspeare_, 1793, 15\r\n     vols., or 1803, 21 vols.

Yet forgive me if I avow that this same country, whose editorial\r\nlabours you are thus commending, is shamefully deficient in the\r\ncultivation of _Ancient English History_! I speak my sentiments\r\nroundly upon this subject: because you know, Lysander, how vigilantly\r\nI have cultivated it, and how long and keenly I have expressed my\r\nregret at the almost total apathy which prevails respecting it. There\r\nis no country upon earth which has a more plentiful or faithful stock\r\nof historians than our own; and if it were only to discover how\r\nsuperficially some of our recent and popular historians have written\r\nupon it, it were surely worth the labour of investigation to examine\r\nthe yet existing records of past ages.\r\n\r\nLOREN. To effect this completely, you should have a NATIONAL PRESS.\r\n\r\nLIS. And why not? Have we here no patriotic spirit similar to that\r\nwhich influenced the Francises, Richlieus, Colberts, and Louises of\r\nFrance?\r\n\r\nALMAN. You are getting into bibliographical politics! Proceed, good\r\nLysander, with your other probable means of cure.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. In the _fourth place_, the erection of PUBLIC\r\nINSTITUTIONS[466] is of great service in diffusing a love of books for\r\ntheir intrinsic utility, and is of very general advantage to scholars\r\nand authors who cannot purchase every book which they find it\r\nnecessary to consult.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 466: The ROYAL, LONDON, SURREY, AND RUSSEL\r\n     INSTITUTIONS, have been the means of concentrating, in\r\n     divers parts of the metropolis, large libraries of useful\r\n     books; which, it is to be hoped, will eventually bring into\r\n     disgrace and contempt what are called _Circulating\r\n     Libraries_--vehicles, too often, of insufferable nonsense,\r\n     and irremediable mischief!]\r\n\r\nPHIL. You are right. These Institutions are of recent growth, but of\r\ngeneral utility. They are a sort of _intellectual Hospitals_--according\r\nto your mode of treating the Bibliomania. Yet I dare venture to affirm\r\nthat the _News-Paper Room_ is always better attended than the\r\n_Library_!\r\n\r\nLYSAND. Let us have no sarcasms. I will now give you the _fifth_ and\r\nlast probable means of cure of the Bibliomania; and that is _the Study\r\nof Bibliography_.[467]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 467: \"UNNE [Transcriber's Note: UNE] BONNE\r\n     BIBLIOGRAPHIE,\" says Marchand, \"soit générale soit\r\n     particuliére, soit profane soit écclésiastique, soit\r\n     nationale, provinciale, ou locale, soit simplement\r\n     personelle, en un mot de quelque autre genre que ce puisse\r\n     être, n'est pas un ouvrage aussi facile que beaucoup de gens\r\n     se le pourroient imaginer; mais, elles ne doivent néanmoins\r\n     nullement prévenir contre celle-ci. Telle qu'elle est, elle\r\n     ne laisse pas d'être bonne, utile, et digne d'être\r\n     recherchée par les amateurs de l'Histoire Litteraire.\"\r\n     _Diction. Historique_, vol. i. p. 109.\r\n\r\n     Peignot, in his _Dictionnaire de Bibliologie_, vol. i. 50,\r\n     has given a very pompous account of what ought to be the\r\n     talents and duties of a bibliographer. It would be difficult\r\n     indeed to find such qualifications, as he describes, united\r\n     in one person! De Bure, in the eighth volume of his\r\n     _Bibliographie Instructive_, has prefixed a \"Discourse upon\r\n     the Science of Bibliography, and the Duties of a\r\n     Bibliographer,\" which is worth consulting: but I know of\r\n     nothing which better describes, in few words, such a\r\n     character, than the following: \"In eo sit multijuga\r\n     materiarum librorumque notitia, ut saltem potiores eligat et\r\n     inquirat: fida et sedula apud exteras gentes procuratio, ut\r\n     eos arcessat; summa patientia ut rarè venalis expectet;\r\n     peculium semper præsens et paratum, ne, si quando occurrunt,\r\n     emendi, occasio intercidat: prudens denique auri argentique\r\n     contemptus, ut pecuniis sponte careat quæ in bibliothecam\r\n     formandam et nutriendam sunt insumendæ. Si forte vir\r\n     literatus eo felicitatis pervenit ut talem thesaurum\r\n     coacervaverit, nec solus illo invidiose fruatur, sed usam\r\n     cum eruditis qui virgilias suas utilitati publicæ\r\n     devoverunt, liberaliter communicet;\" &c.--_Bibliotheca\r\n     Hulsiana_, vol. i. Præfat. p. 3, 4. Morhof abounds with\r\n     sagacious reflections upon this important subject: but are\r\n     there fifty men in Great Britain who love to read the\r\n     _Polyhistor Literarius_? The observations of Ameilhon and\r\n     Camus, in the _Memoires de l'Institut_, are also well worth\r\n     consultation; as are those of Le Long, and his editor,\r\n     prefixed to the last edition of the _Bibliotheca Sacra_.]\r\n\r\nLIS. Excellent!--Treat copiously upon this my darling subject.\r\n\r\nBELIN. You speak with the enthusiasm of a young convert; but I should\r\nthink the study of Bibliography a sure means of increasing the\r\nviolence of the book-disease.\r\n\r\nLYSAND. The encouragement of _the Study of Bibliography_, in its\r\nlegitimate sense, and towards its true object, may be numbered among\r\nthe most efficacious cures for this destructive malady. To place\r\ncompetent Librarians over the several departments of a large public\r\nLibrary; or to submit a library, on a more confined scale, to one\r\ndiligent, enthusiastic, well-informed, and well-bred Bibliographer or\r\nLibrarian (of which in this metropolis we have so many examples), is\r\ndoing a vast deal towards directing the channels of literature to flow\r\nin their proper courses. And thus I close the account of my recipes\r\nfor the cure of the Bibliomania. A few words more and I have done.\r\n\r\nIt is, my friends, in the erection of Libraries as in literary\r\ncompositions, the task is difficult, and will generally meet with\r\nopposition from some fastidious quarter,[468] which is always\r\nbetraying a fretful anxiety to bring every thing to its own ideal\r\nstandard of perfection. To counteract the unpleasant effect which such\r\nan impression must necessarily produce, be diligent and faithful, to\r\nyour utmost ability, in whatsoever you undertake. You need not evince\r\nthe fecundity of a German[469] author; but only exert your best\r\nendeavours, and leave the issue to a future generation. Posterity will\r\nweigh, in even scales, your merits and demerits, when all present\r\nanimosities and personal prejudices shall have subsided; and when the\r\nutility of our labours, whether in promoting wisdom or virtue, shall\r\nbe unreservedly acknowledged. You may sleep in peace before this\r\ndecision take place; but YOUR CHILDREN may live to witness it; and\r\nyour name, in consequence, become a passport for them into circles of\r\nlearning and worth. Let us now retreat; or, rather, walk round\r\nLorenzo's grounds. We have had _Book-Discussion_ enough to last us to\r\nthe end of the year.[470] I begin to be wearied of conversing.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 468: My favourite author, Morhof, has spoken\r\n     'comme un brave homme' upon the difficulty of literary\r\n     enterprizes, and the facility and venom of detraction: I\r\n     support his assertion 'totis viribus'; and to beg to speak\r\n     in the same person with himself. 'Non ignotum mihi est,\r\n     quantæ molis opus humeris meis incumbat. Oceanum enim\r\n     ingressus sum, in quo portum invenire difficile est,\r\n     naufragii periculum à syrtibus et scopulis imminet. Quis\r\n     enim in tanta multitudine rerum et librorum omnia\r\n     exhauriret? Quis non alicubi impingeret? Quis salvum ab\r\n     invidia caput retraheret, ac malignitatis dentes in\r\n     liberiore censura evitaret? Præterea ut palato et gustu\r\n     differunt convivæ, ita judiciis dissident lectores, neque\r\n     omnium idem de rebus sensus est, hoc præsertim tempore, quo\r\n     plures sunt librorum judices, quam lectores, et è lectoribus\r\n     in lictores, ubique virgas et secures expedituros, multi\r\n     degenerant.' _Præf. Morhof._--Even the great Lambecius (of\r\n     whom see p. 41, ante) was compelled to deliver his\r\n     sentiments thus:--'laborem hunc meum non periculosum minus\r\n     et maglignis liventium _Zoilorum_ dentibus obnoxium, quam\r\n     prolixum foro et difficilem.' Prod. Hist. Lit. _Proleg._ One\r\n     of the Roman philosophers (I think it was Seneca) said, in\r\n     his last moments, 'Whether or not the Gods will be pleased\r\n     with what I have done, I cannot take upon me to pronounce:\r\n     but, this I know--it has been my invariable object to please\r\n     them.' For 'the Gods' read 'the Public'--and then I beg\r\n     leave, in a literary point of view, to repeat the words of\r\n     Seneca.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 469: 'From the last catalogue of the fair of\r\n     Lepisic [Transcriber's Note: Leipsic], it would appear that\r\n     there are now in Germany _ten thousand two hundred and forty\r\n     three authors_, full of _health_ and _spirit_, and each of\r\n     whom publishes at least _once a year_!' _American Review_,\r\n     Jan. 1811, p. 172.]\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 470: Through the favour of Dr. Drury, the Editor\r\n     is enabled to present the reader with an original letter,\r\n     enclosing a list of books directed to be purchased by\r\n     BENJAMIN HEATH, Esq.; also his portrait. This document would\r\n     have been better inserted, in point of chronological order,\r\n     in part V., but, as the Editor did not receive it till long\r\n     after that part was printed, he trusts it will be thought\r\n     better late than never.\r\n\r\n     THE DIRECTION.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: [handwritten]\r\n\r\n     To\r\n     Mr John Mann\r\n     at the Hand in Hand\r\n     Fire Office in Angel Court\r\n     on Snow Hill\r\n     [illegible]\r\n     in\r\n     London]\r\n\r\n     Exeter, 21st March, 1738.\r\n\r\n     Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n     I take the liberty presuming upon the Intimacy of our\r\n     Acquaintance to employ you in a pretty troublesome Affair.\r\n     Fletcher Gyles, Bookseller in Holbourn, with whom I had some\r\n     Dealings about two years ago, has lately sent me Down a\r\n     Catalogue of a Library which will begin to be sold by\r\n     Auction at his house next Monday Evening. As I have scarce\r\n     laid out any Money in Books for these two years past, the\r\n     great number of Valuable Books contained in this Collection,\r\n     together with the tempting prospect of getting them cheaper\r\n     in an Auction than they are to be had in a Sale, or in any\r\n     other way whatsoever, has induced me to lay out a Sum of\r\n     mony this way, at present, which will probably content my\r\n     Curiosity in this kind, for several years to come. Mr. Gyles\r\n     has offered himself to act for me, but as I think 'tis too\r\n     great a Trial of his Honesty to make him at the same time\r\n     both Buyer & Seller, & as Books are quite out of my\r\n     Brother's Way, I have been able to think of no Friend I\r\n     could throw this trouble upon but you. I propose to lay out\r\n     about £60 or £70, and have drawn up a List of the Books I am\r\n     inclined to, which you have in the First Leaf, with the\r\n     Price to each Book, which I would by no means exceed, but as\r\n     far as which, with respect to each single Book, I would\r\n     venture to go; though I am persuaded upon the whole they are\r\n     vastly overvalued. For my Valuation is founded in proportion\r\n     upon what I have been charged for Books of this kind, when I\r\n     have sent for them on purpose from London, and I have had\r\n     too many proofs that the Booksellers make it a Rule to\r\n     charge near double for an uncommon Book, when sent for on\r\n     purpose, of what they would take for it in their own Shops,\r\n     or at a Sale. So that, though the Amount of the Inclosed\r\n     List is above £120, yet, when Deductions are made for the\r\n     Savings by the Chance of the Auction, & for the full rate of\r\n     such Books as I may be over bid in, I am satisfied it will\r\n     come within the sum I propose. Now, Sir, the Favour which I\r\n     would beg of you is to get some Trusty Person (& if you\r\n     should not be able readily to think of a proper Person\r\n     yourself, Mr. Hinchcliffe or Mr. Peele may probably be able\r\n     to recommend one) to attend this Auction, in my behalf, from\r\n     the beginning to the end, & to bid for me agreeably to the\r\n     inclosed List & (as the Additional Trouble of it over and\r\n     above the Attendance would not be great) to mark in the\r\n     Catalogue, which you may have of Mr. Gyles for a shilling,\r\n     the price Every Book contained in the Catalogue is sold at,\r\n     for my future Direction in these Matters. For this Service I\r\n     would willingly allow 3 Guineas, which, the Auction\r\n     continuing 24 Days, is 3 shillings over and above half a\r\n     Crown a Day; or, if that is not sufficient, whatever more\r\n     shall be thought necessary to get my Commission well\r\n     Executed. It may be necessary to observe to you that the\r\n     Auction requires the Attendance of the whole day, beginning\r\n     at Eleven in the Morning, and ending at two and at five in\r\n     the Afternoon, and Ending at Eight. It may also be proper to\r\n     inform the Person you shall Employ that he is not to govern\r\n     his first bidding by the valuation in my list for many of\r\n     the Books will very probably be sold for less than half what\r\n     I have marked them at; he is therefore, in every Instance,\r\n     to bid Low at first, and afterwards to continue advancing\r\n     just beyond the other Bidders, till he has either bought the\r\n     Book, or the price I have fixed it at is exceeded. There are\r\n     many Books in the List which have several numbers before\r\n     them; the meaning of which is that the very same Book is in\r\n     several places of the Catalogue; and in that Case, I would\r\n     have the first of them bought, if it be in very good\r\n     condition, otherwise let the person Employed wait till the\r\n     other comes up. I would desire him also not to buy any book\r\n     at all that is both Dirty & ragged; but, though the Binding\r\n     should not be in very good Order, that would be no Objection\r\n     with me, provided the Book was clean. I would also desire\r\n     him not to bid for any Number in the Catalogue that is not\r\n     expressly mentioned in my List, upon a supposition that it\r\n     may be the same Book with some that are mentioned in it; nor\r\n     to omitt any Book that is actually upon the List, upon an\r\n     Imagination, from the Title, that it may be there more than\r\n     once; for I have drawn it up upon an Exact consideration of\r\n     the Editions of the Books, insomuch that there is no Book\r\n     twice upon the List, but where there is a very great\r\n     difference in the Editions; nor is any of the Books in my\r\n     List oftener in the Catalogue than is expressly specified in\r\n     it. By the Conditions of Sale, the Auction is constantly\r\n     adjourned from Fryday night to Monday Morning, the Saturday\r\n     being appointed for fetching away, at the Expence of the\r\n     buyer, the Books bought the week before, & for payment of\r\n     the Mony. This part of the trouble I must beg you to charge\r\n     yourself with; &, in order to enable you, as to the payment,\r\n     I shall send you up, either by the next Post, or, however,\r\n     time enough for the Saturday following, Fifty Pounds. I\r\n     would beg the Favour of you to let me hear from you, if\r\n     possible, by the Return of the Post; & also to give me an\r\n     Account by every Saturday night's post what Books are bought\r\n     for me, and at what price. As to which you need only mention\r\n     the Numbers without the Titles, since I have a Catalogue by\r\n     me. When the Auction is Ended, I shall take the Liberty of\r\n     giving you farther Directions about Packing up the Books, &\r\n     the way I would have them sent down. When I drew up my List,\r\n     I had not observed one of the Conditions of Sale, which\r\n     imports that no Person is to advance less than a shilling\r\n     after twenty shillings is bid for any book. Now you will\r\n     find a pretty many Books which I have valued at more than\r\n     twenty shillings marked at an Odd Sixpence; in all which\r\n     Cases, I would have the Bidder add Sixpence more to the\r\n     Price I have fixed, in order to make it Even Money, &\r\n     conformable to the Conditions of the Auction. And now, Dear\r\n     Sir, another Person would make a thousand Apologies for\r\n     giving you all this trouble; all which superfluous\r\n     tediousness I shall spare you, being persuaded I shall do\r\n     you a great pleasure in giving you an Opportunity of being\r\n     serviceable to me, as I am sure it would be a very sensible\r\n     one to me, if I ever had it in my power to be of any use to\r\n     you. Mine and my Wive's humble respects wait upon Mrs. Mann,\r\n     and you will be so good to present my hearty services to all\r\n     our Friends.\r\n\r\n     I am most sincerely,\r\n\r\n     Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: [handwritten] Your Faithful & Affectionate\r\n     humble Servt.\r\n\r\n     Benj Heath]\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: HIS SEAL.]\r\n\r\n                                                      £  _s._  _d._\r\n\r\n     Octavo   5 Pet.

It was now high noon; and, after a\r\npleasant stroll, we retreated again to THE ALCOVE, where we found a\r\ncold collation prepared for our reception. The same day we all dined\r\nat Lisardo's; and a discussion upon the pleasures and comparative\r\nexcellences of _Music_ and _Painting_ succeeded to the conversation\r\nwhich the foregoing pages have detailed. A small concert in the\r\nevening recreated the exhausted state of Lysander's mimd\r\n[Transcriber's Note: mind].\r\n\r\nThe next day, my friends left me for their respective places of\r\ndestination. Lorenzo and his sisters were gathered round my outer\r\ngate; and Lisardo leapt into the chaise with Lysander and Philemon;\r\nresolved to equal, if not eclipse, his bibliographical tutor in the\r\nardour of book researches. \"Adieu,\" said Lysander, putting his hand\r\nout of the chaise--\"remember, in defence of my bibliomaniacal\r\ngossipping, that SIMILIS never knew happiness _till he became\r\nacquainted with_ BOOKS.\"[471] The postillion smacked his whip; and the\r\nchaise, following the direction of the road to the left, quickly\r\ndisappeared. The servant of Lysander followed gently after, with his\r\nMaster's and Philemon's horses: taking a near direction towards\r\nLysander's home.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 471: 'It is reported that a certain man, of the\r\n     name of SIMILIS, who fought under the Emperor Hadrian,\r\n     became so wearied and disgusted with the number of\r\n     troublesome events which he met with in that mode of life,\r\n     that he retired and devoted himself wholly to leisure and\r\n     _reading_, and to meditations upon divine and human affairs,\r\n     after the manner of Pythagoras. In this retirement, Similis\r\n     was wont frequently to exclaim that '_now_ he began to\r\n     _live_:' at his death, he desired the following inscription\r\n     to be placed upon his tomb.\r\n\r\n          [Greek: SIMILIS\r\n          EN TAUTHA KEITAI\r\n          BIOUE MEN ETÊ EBDOMÊKONTA\r\n          ZÊSAS DE ETÊ EPTA]\r\n\r\n          _Here lies Similis;\r\n          In the seventieth year of his age\r\n          But only the seventh of his Life._\r\n\r\n     This story is related by Dion Cassius; and from him told by\r\n     Spizelius in his _Infelix Literarius_; p. 167.]\r\n\r\nLorenzo and his sisters returned with me to the Cabinet. A gloom was\r\nvisible upon all our countenances; and the Ladies confessed that the\r\ncompany and conversation of my departed guests, especially of\r\nLysander, were such as to leave a void which could not easily be\r\nsupplied. For my part, from some little warmth each sister betrayed in\r\nbalancing the solid instruction of Lysander and the humorous vivacity\r\nof Lisardo, against each other, I thought the former had made a\r\npowerful impression upon the mind of Belinda, and the latter upon that\r\nof Almansa: for when the probability of a speedy revisit from both of\r\nthem was mentioned the sisters betrayed unusual marks of sensibility;\r\nand upon Lorenzo's frankly confessing, though in a playful mood, that\r\nsuch brothers-in-law would make him \"as happy as the day was\r\nlong\"--they both turned their faces towards the garden, and appeared\r\nas awkward as it was possible for well-bred ladies to appear.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that I turned to my library and opened a large paper,\r\nillustrated, copy of Daulby's _Catalogue of Rembrandt's Prints_, or\r\nMr. Miller's new edition of the _Memoirs of Count Grammont_, or even\r\nthe _Roman de la Rose_, printed by Galliot du Pré, UPON VELLUM....\r\nNothing produced a kind look or a gracious word from them. Silence,\r\nsorrow, and indifference, succeeded to loquacity, joy, and enthusiasm.\r\nI clearly perceived that some _other_ symptom, wholly different from\r\nany thing connected with the Bibliomania, had taken possession of\r\ntheir gentle minds.\r\n\r\nBut what has a BIBLIOGRAPHICAL ROMANCE to do with _Love_ and\r\n_Marriage_? Reader Adieu!--When thou hast nothing better deserving of\r\nperusal before thee, take up these pages; and class the author of\r\nthem, if thou wilt, with the BOSTONS, or SMITHS, or NORTHS, of \"other\r\ntimes;\" with those who have never wished to disturb the peaceful\r\nhaunts of intellectual retirement; and whose estate, moreover, like\r\nJoseph Scaliger's, lies chiefly under his hat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\np. 57. To the list of useful bibliographical works, published about\r\nthe period here designated, I might have added the _Lexicon\r\nLiterarium_ of THEOPHILUS GEORGIUS; _cum Suppl. ad an._ 1750. _Leips._\r\n1742-50, folio; two thick and closely printed volumes, with an\r\nexcellent chronological arrangement. It is not common in this country.\r\n\r\np. 69. The Abbé Rive was also the author of--1. _Notice d'un Roman\r\nd'Artus Comte de Bretagne_: Paris, 1779, 4to. _pp._ 20. 2. _Etrennes\r\naux Joueurs de cartes, ou Eclaircissemens historiques et critiques\r\nsur l'invention des cartes à jouer; Paris_, 1780, 12mo. _pp._ 43.\r\nThese works are slightly commended in the \"Advertissement\" to the\r\nVallière Catalogue, 1783, pp. xxv-vj. They are reviewed by a rival\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\np. 216. Since writing the first note, concerning the \"_Assertio Septem\r\nSacramentorum_,\" &c., I have seen a magnificent copy of the same,\r\nprinted UPON VELLUM, in the library of Earl Spencer; which redeems the\r\ncoldness of my opinion in regard to books printed by Pynson upon\r\nvellum. The painted ornaments, in Lord Spencer's copy, were, in all\r\nprobability, executed abroad. The art, in our own country, was then\r\ntoo rude for such elegance of decoration.\r\n\r\np. 404. I was right in my prediction about these _Garlands_ being\r\nswallowed up by some \"hungry book-fish!\" I saw them, a few days after,\r\nin the well-furnished library of ATTICUS: who exhibited them to me in\r\ntriumph--grasping the whole of them between his finger and thumb! They\r\nare marvellous well-looking little volumes--clean, bright, and\r\n\"rejoicing to the eye!\"--many of them, moreover, are first editions!\r\nThe severest winter cannot tarnish the foliage of such \"Garlands!\"\r\n\r\np. 328. Among the ILLUSTRATED GRANGERS I forgot to notice the ample\r\nand magnificent copies belonging to the Marquis of Bute and Mr. John\r\nTowneley.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. BENJAMIN HEATH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE SUPPLEMENT.\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nTHE EVENING WALK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scenery and the dialogue of this Part are more especially\r\n_Waltonian_. The characters are few; but LYSANDER must of necessity be\r\nthe Author--as he is the principal actor in the scene, and throughout\r\nthe entire work the principal intelligence is derived from his lips.\r\nThe scene itself is not absolutely ideal. At the little village of\r\n----, upon the upper grounds, near Marlow, and necessarily commanding\r\na sweep of the Thames in one of its most richly wooded windings, there\r\nlived a Mr. Jacobs, the friend of the adjoining Rector, whose table\r\nwas as bounteous as his heart was hospitable; and whose frequent\r\ncustom it was, in summer months, to elicit sweet discourse from his\r\nguests, as they sauntered, after an early supper, to inhale the\r\nfragrance of \"dewy eve,\" and to witness the ascendancy of the moon in\r\na cool and cloudless sky. I have partaken more than once of these\r\n\"Tusculan\" discussions; and have heard sounds, and witnessed\r\nhappiness, such as is not likely to be my lot again. PHILEMON is at\r\nrest in his grave, as well as MENANDER and SICORAX. The two latter, it\r\nis well known, were Tom Warton and Joseph Ritson. \"The husband of poor\r\nLavinia\" was a most amiable gentleman, but timid to a morbid excess.\r\nWithout strong powers of intellect, he was tenacious of every thing\r\nwhich he advanced, and yet the farthest possible from dogmatic\r\nrudeness. There are cankers that eat into the _heart_ as well as the\r\ncheek; and because Mr. Shacklewell (the NICAS of my text) happened to\r\ndiscover a few unimportant errors in that husband's last performance,\r\nthe latter not only thought much and often about it, but seemed to\r\ntake it seriously to heart, and scarcely survived it a twelvemonth.\r\n\r\nGONZALO, mentioned at page 12, was a Mr. Jessop; an exceedingly\r\nlively, inoffensive, but not over wise gentleman; a coxcomb to excess\r\nin every thing; but not without vivacious parts, which occasionally\r\npleased, from the _manner_ in which they were exhibited. Of handsome\r\nperson and fluent speech, he was generally acceptable to the fair sex;\r\nbut he made no strong _individual_ impression, as he was known to use\r\nthe same current phrases and current compliments to all. Just possible\r\nit was that his personal attractions and ready utterance were\r\nbeginning to strike a _root_ or two in some one female bosom; but it\r\nwas impossible for these roots to penetrate deeply, and take an\r\n_exclusive_ hold. I believe Mr. Jessop quitted the neighbourhood of\r\nMarlow shortly after the publication of the Bibliomania, to return\r\nthither no more. ALFONSO was a Mr. Morell; a name well known in\r\nOxfordshire. He was always in the _same_ false position, from the\r\nbeginning to the end; but I am not sure whether this be not better\r\nthan a perpetually shifting false position. Disguise it as you may, an\r\nobstinate man is preferable to a _trimmer_; be he a common man, or an\r\nuncommon man; a layman or a clergyman; \"in crape,\" or \"in lawn.\"\r\n\r\nThe compliment paid by Lysander (at pages 18, 19) to Dr. VINCENT, late\r\nDean of Westminster, and head master of Westminster School, were\r\nacknowledged by that venerable and most worthy, as well as erudite,\r\ncharacter, in a letter to me, which I deemed it but an act of justice\r\nto its author to publish in the _Bibliographical Decameron_, vol. iii.\r\np. 353. Poor Mr. BARKER (Edmund Henry), who is handsomely mentioned in\r\nthe Dean's letter, has very lately taken his departure from us, for\r\n_that_ quiet which he could not find upon earth. \"Take him for all in\r\nall\" he was a very extraordinary man. Irritable to excess; but ardent\r\nand ambitious in his literary career. His industry, when, as in former\r\ndays, it was at its height, would have killed half the scholars of the\r\ntime. How he attained his fiftieth year, may be deemed miraculous;\r\nconsidering upon what a tempestuous sea his vessel of life seemed to\r\nbe embarked. Latterly, he took to politics; when--\"farewell the\r\ntranquil mind!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nTHE CABINET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis portion of the \"Bibliomania,\" embracing about fourscore pages,\r\ncontains a _Précis_, or review of the more popular works, then extant,\r\nupon BIBLIOGRAPHY. It forms an immense mass of materials; which, if\r\nexpanded in the ordinary form of publication, would alone make a\r\nvolume. I have well nigh forgotten the names of some of the more\r\nancient heroes of bibliographical renown, but still seem to cling with\r\na natural fondness to those of Gesner, Morhof, Maittaire, and\r\nFabricius: while Labbe, Lambecius, and Montfauçon, Le Long, and\r\nBaillet, even yet retain all their ancient respect and popularity. As\r\nno _fresh characters_ are introduced in this second part of the\r\nBibliomania, it may be permitted me to say a word or two upon the\r\nsubstance of the materials which it contains.\r\n\r\nThe immense note upon the \"_Catalogue of Libraries_,\" alphabetically\r\narranged, from page 72 to page 99, is now, necessarily, imperfect;\r\nfrom the number of libraries which have been subsequently sold or\r\ndescribed. Among the _latter_, I hope I may naturally, and\r\njustifiably, make mention of the BIBLIOTHECA SPENCERIANA; or, A\r\ndescriptive Catalogue of the early printed Books of the late George\r\nJohn Earl Spencer, K.G.; comprising, in the whole, seven volumes; with\r\nthe addition of the Cassano Library, or books purchased of the Duke of\r\nCassano, by the noble Earl, when at Naples, in the year 1819. In the\r\n\"_Reminiscences of my Literary Life_,\" I have given a sort of graphic\r\ndescription of this extensive work, and of the circumstances attending\r\nits publication. _That_ work now rests upon its own particular, and, I\r\nwill fearlessly add, solid, basis. For accuracy, learning, splendour,\r\nand almost interminable embellishment, it may seem at once to command\r\nthe attention, and to challenge the commendation, of the most\r\nfastidious: but it is a flower which blooms more kindly in a foreign,\r\nthan in its native, soil. It has obtained for me the notice and the\r\napplause of learned _foreigners_; and when I travelled abroad I\r\nreceived but too substantial proofs that what was slighted _here_ was\r\nappreciated in _foreign_ parts. Our more popular Reviews, which seem\r\nto thrive and fatten best upon lean fare, passed this magnificent work\r\nover in a sort of sly or sullen silence; and there is no record of its\r\nexistence in those of our Journals which affect to strike the key-note\r\nonly of what is valuable in science, literature, and the fine arts.\r\nPainful as it must ever be to my feelings to contrast the avidity of\r\nformer purchasers to become possessed of it with the caprice and\r\nnon-chalance which have marked the conduct of those possessors\r\nthemselves, I will yet hope that, in the bosom of the SUCCESSOR to\r\nthis matchless Library--as well as to the name and fortunes of its\r\nlate owner--there will ever remain but _one feeling_, such as no\r\nmisconception and no casualty will serve to efface. It is pleasing,\r\nyea, soothing, 'midst the buffetting surges of later life, to be able\r\nto keep the anchor of one's vessel _well bit_ in the interstices of\r\ngranite.\r\n\r\nMuch later than the publication last alluded to, were the sale\r\ncatalogues of the Libraries of Sir MARK MASTERMAN SYKES, Bart.,\r\ndeceased; the Rev. HENRY DRURY; GEORGE HIBBERT, Esq., deceased; and\r\nSir FRANCIS FREELING, Bart., deceased. They were all sold by Mr.\r\nEvans, of Pall Mall; as well indeed as was the Library of the late\r\nDuke of Marlborough, when Marquis of Blandford. What books! And what\r\nprices! It should seem that \"there were giants,\" both in purse and\r\nmagnitude of metal, \"in those days!\" But a mighty \"man in valour\" has\r\nrecently sprung up amongst us; who, spurning the acquisition of\r\nsolitary _lots_, darts down upon a whole _Library_, and bears it off\r\n\"at one fell swoop.\" Long life to the spirit which possesses him! It\r\nis almost a national redemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nTHE AUCTION-ROOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are here introduced into one of the most bustling and\r\nspirit-stirring portions of the whole Work. It is full of\r\ncharacters--alas! now, with only _two_ exceptions, mouldering in their\r\ncoffins! Philemon (who was one of my earliest and steadiest friends)\r\nintroduces us to a character, which, under the name of ORLANDO, made\r\nsome impression upon the public, as it was thought to represent\r\nMICHAEL WODHULL, Esq., of Thenford Hall, near Banbury; an admirable\r\nGreek scholar (the translator of Euripides), and perhaps the most\r\nlearned bibliographer of his age. The conjecture of Orlando being the\r\nrepresentative of Mr. Wodhull was not a vain conjecture; although\r\nthere were, necessarily (I will not say _why_), parts that slightly\r\nvaried from the original. Mr. Wodhull re-appears, in his natural\r\nperson, in the _Bibliographical Decameron_, vol. iii. p. 363-6. Since\r\nthe publication of that work, a curious history attaches to his\r\nmemory. Within a twelvemonth of the expiration of the statute of\r\nlimitation, an action at law, in the shape of an ejectment, was set on\r\nfoot by a neighbouring family, to dispossess the present rightful\r\noccupant, S.A. SEVERNE, Esq., of the beautiful domain of Thenford; to\r\nransack the Library; to scatter abroad pictures and curiosities of\r\nevery description; on the alleged ground of insanity, or incompetency\r\nto make a will, on the part of Mr. Wodhull. As I had been very minute\r\nin the account of Mr. Wodhull's person, in the work just alluded to, I\r\nbecame a _witness_ in the cause; and, as it was brought into Chancery,\r\nmy deposition was accordingly taken. I could have neither reluctance\r\nnor disinclination to meet the call of my excellent friend, Mr.\r\nSeverne; as I was abundantly confident that the charge of\r\n\"incompetency to make a will\" could not rest upon the slightest\r\nfoundation. It was insinuated, indeed, that the sister-in-law, Miss\r\nIngram, had forged Mr. Wodhull's name to the will.\r\n\r\nSuch a conspiracy, to defraud an honourable man and legitimate\r\ndescendant of his property, is hardly upon record; for, waiting the\r\naccidents that might occur by death, or otherwise, in the lapse of\r\ntwenty years, the cause was brought into the Vice Chancellor's Court\r\nwith the most sanguine hope of success. I was present during one of\r\nthe days of argument, and heard my own letter read, of which I had\r\n(contrary to my usual habits) taken a copy. The plaintiffs had written\r\nto me (suppressing the fact of the intended action), requesting to\r\nhave my opinion as to Mr. Wodhull's capability. I returned such an\r\nanswer as truth dictated. The Counsel for the plaintiffs (_ut mos\r\nest_) showered down upon the defendant every epithet connected with\r\nbase fraud and low cunning, of which the contents of the brief seemed\r\nto warrant the avowal. In due course, Sir Knight Bruce, now one of the\r\nsupernumerary Vice Chancellors, rose to reply. His speech was one\r\nundisturbed stream of unclouded narrative and irresistible reasoning.\r\nThe Vice Chancellor (Shadwell) gave judgment; and my amiable and\r\nexcellent friend, Mr. Severne, was not only to return in triumph to\r\nthe mansion and to the groves which had been built and planted by his\r\nvenerable ancestor, Mr. Wodhull, but he was strongly advised, by the\r\nincorruptible judge on the bench, to bring an action against the\r\nplaintiffs for one of the foulest conspiracies that had ever been\r\ndeveloped in a court of justice. The defendant might have transported\r\nthe whole kit of them. But the _giving_ advice, and the _following_ it\r\nwhen given, are two essentially different things. A THOUSAND GUINEAS\r\nhad been already expended on the part of Mr. Severne! When does my\r\nLord Brougham _really_ mean to reform the law? A recent publication\r\n(\"Cranmer, a Novel\") has said, \"that he applies _sedatives_, when he\r\nshould have recourse to _operations_.\"\r\n\r\nBut the reader must now hurry with me into \"The Auction Room.\" Of the\r\nwhole group there represented, full of life and of action, TWO ONLY\r\nremain to talk of the conquests achieved![472] And Mr. Hamper,\r\ntoo--whose note, at p. 117, is beyond all price--has been lately\r\n\"gathered to his fathers.\" \"Ibimus, ibimus!\" But for our book-heroes\r\nin the Auction Room.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 472: Before mention made of the Auction Room,\r\n     there is a long and particular account of the \"_Lectionum\r\n     Memorabilium et Reconditarum Centenarii XVI._\" by John Wolf,\r\n     in 1600, folio; with a fac simile, by myself, of the\r\n     portrait of the Author. It had a great effect, at the time,\r\n     in causing copies of this work to be sedulously sought for\r\n     and sold at extravagant prices. I have known a fine copy of\r\n     this ugly book bring £8 8_s._]\r\n\r\nThe first in years, as well as in celebrity, is LEPIDUS; the\r\nrepresentative of the late Rev. Dr. GOSSET. In the _Bibliographical\r\nDecameron_, vol. iii. p. 5, ample mention is made of him; and here it\r\nis, to me, an equally grateful and delightful task to record the\r\nworth, as well as the existence, of his two sons, Isaac and Thomas,\r\neach a minister of the Church of England. The former is covered with\r\n_olive branches_ as well as with reputation; while the latter,\r\ndeclining the \"branches\" in question, rests upon the stem of his own\r\ninflexible worth, and solid scholastic attainments. Mrs. Gardiner, the\r\nwife of a Major Gardiner, is the only daughter of Dr. Gosset; a wife,\r\nbut not a mother. The second in the ranks is MUSTAPHA. Every body\r\nquickly found out the original in Mr. Gardiner, a bookseller in Pall\r\nMall; who quickly set about repelling the attack here made upon him,\r\nby a long note appended to the article \"Bibliomania,\" in one of his\r\ncatalogues. Gardiner never lacked courage; but, poor man! his brains\r\nwere under no controul. We _met_ after this reply, and, to the best of\r\nmy recollection, we exchanged ... _smiles_. The catalogue in question,\r\nnot otherwise worth a stiver, has been sold as high as 15s., in\r\nconsequence of the Dibdinian flagellation. Poor Gardiner! his end was\r\nmost deplorable.\r\n\r\nWe approach BERNARDO, who was intended to represent the late Mr.\r\nJOSEPH HASLEWOOD; and of whose book-fame a very particular, and I\r\nwould hope impartial, account will be found in the \"_Literary\r\nReminiscences of my Literary Life_.\" There is no one portion of that\r\nwork which affords me more lively satisfaction on a re-perusal. The\r\ncause of the _individual_ was merged in the cause of _truth_. The\r\nstrangest compound of the strangest materials that ever haunted a\r\nhuman brain, poor Bernardo was, in spite of himself, a man of _note_\r\ntowards his latter days. Every body wondered what was in him; but\r\nsomething, certainly worth the perusal; oozed out of him in his\r\nvarious motley performances; and especially in his edition of Drunken\r\nBarnaby's Tour, which exhibited the rare spectacle of an accurate\r\nLatin (as well as English) text, by an individual who did not know the\r\ndative singular from the dative plural of _hic, hæc, hoc_! Haslewood,\r\nhowever, \"hit the right nail upon the head\" when he found out the\r\n_real_ author Barnaby, in Richard Brathwait; from the unvarying\r\ndesignation of \"_On the Errata_,\" at the end of Brathwait's pieces,\r\nwhich is observable in that of his \"_Drunken Barnaby's Tour_.\" It was\r\nan [Greek: eurêcha] [Transcriber's Note: [Greek: eurêka]] in its way;\r\nand the late Mr. Heber used to shout aloud, \"stick to _that_,\r\nHaslewood, and your fame is fixed!\" He was always proud of it; but\r\nlost sight of it sadly, as well as of almost every thing else, when he\r\ncomposed \"_The Roxburghe Revels_.\" Yet what could justify the cruelty\r\nof dragging this piece of private absurdity before the public\r\ntribunal, on the death of its author? Even in the grave our best\r\nfriends may be our worst foes.\r\n\r\nAt page 196 we are introduced to QUISQUILIUS, the then intended\r\nrepresentative of Mr. George Baker, of St. Paul's Churchyard; whose\r\nprints and graphic curiosities were sold after his death for several\r\nthousand pounds. Mr. Baker did not survive the publication of the\r\nBibliomania; but it is said he got scent of his delineated character,\r\nwhich ruffled every feather of his plumage. He was thin-skinned to\r\nexcess; and, as far as that went, a _Heautontomorumenos_! Will this\r\nword \"re-animate his clay?\"\r\n\r\nThe \"short gentleman,\" called ROSICRUSIUS, at page 127, must\r\nnecessarily be the author of the work. He has not grown _taller_ since\r\nits publication, and his coffers continue to retain the same stinted\r\ncondition as his person. Yet what has he not _produced_ since that\r\nrepresentation of his person? How has it pleased a gracious Providence\r\nto endow him with mental and bodily health and stamina, to prosecute\r\nlabours, and to surmount difficulties, which might have broken the\r\nhearts, as well as the backs, of many a wight \"from five to ten inches\r\ntaller than himself!\" I desire to be grateful for this prolongation of\r\nlabour as well as of life; and it will be my heart-felt consolation,\r\neven to my dying hour, that such \"labour\" will be acceptable to the\r\nlatest posterity.\r\n\r\nYet a word or two by way of epilogue. The \"Reminiscences\" contain a\r\ncatalogue raisonné of such works as were published up to the year\r\n1836. Since then the author has not been idle. The \"_Tour into the\r\nNorth of England and Scotland_,\" in two super-royal octavos, studded\r\nwith graphic gems of a variety of description--and dedicated to the\r\nmost illustrious female in Europe, for the magnificence of a library,\r\nthe fruit chiefly of her own enterprise and liberality--has at least\r\nproved and maintained the spirit by which he has been long actuated.\r\nTo re-animate a slumbering taste, to bring back the gay and gallant\r\nfeelings of past times, to make men feel as gentlemen in the\r\nsubstitution of _guineas_ for _shillings_, still to uphold the beauty\r\nof the press, and the splendour of marginal magnitude, were, alone,\r\nobjects worthy an experiment to accomplish. But this work had other\r\nand stronger claims to public notice and patronage; and it did not\r\nfail to receive them. Six hundred copies were irrevocably fixed in the\r\ncourse of the first eighteen months from the day of publication, and\r\nthe price of the large paper has attained the sum of £12. 12_s._\r\nStrange circumstances have, however, here and there, thrown dark\r\nshadows across the progress of the sale.\r\n\r\nIf it were pleasing to the Author, in the course of his Journey, to\r\nreceive attentions, and to acknowledge hospitalities, from the gay and\r\nthe great, it were yet more pleasing to hope and to believe that such\r\nattentions and hospitalities had been acknowledged with feelings and\r\nexpressions becoming the character of a gentleman. They have been so;\r\nas the pages of the work abundantly testify. But English courtesy is\r\ntoo frequently _located_. It is a coin with a feeble impress, and\r\nseems subject to woful attrition in its circulation. The countenance,\r\nwhich beams with complacency on receiving a guest to enliven a dull\r\nresidence, in a desolate neighbourhood, is oftentimes overcharged with\r\nsadness, or collapses into rigidity, if the same guest should come\r\nunder recognizance in a populous city. When I write \"Instructions for\r\nan Author on his travels,\" I will advise a measured civility and a\r\nconstrained homage:--to criticise fearlessly, and to praise sparingly.\r\nThere are hearts too obtuse for the operations of gratitude. The\r\nScotch have behaved worthy of the inhabitants of the \"land of cakes.\"\r\nIn spirit I am ever present with them, and rambling 'midst their\r\nmountains and passes. If an Author may criticise his own works, I\r\nshould say that the preface to the Scotch Tour is the best piece of\r\ncomposition of which I have been ever guilty.\r\n\r\nHow little are people aware of the pleasure they sometimes\r\nunconsciously afford! When Mr. James Bohn, the publisher of the Scotch\r\nTour, placed me, one day, accidentally, opposite a long list of\r\nsplendidly bound books, and asked me \"if I were acquainted with their\r\nauthor?\" I could not help inwardly exclaiming ... \"NON OMNIS\r\nMORIAR!\"[473] I am too poor to present them to my \"Sovereign Mistress,\r\nthe Queen Victoria;\" but I _did_ present her Majesty, in person, with\r\na magnificently bound copy of the _Scotch Tour_; of which the\r\nacceptance was never acknowledged from the royal quarter; simply\r\nbecause, according to an etiquette which seems to me to be utterly\r\nincomprehensible, books presented _in person_ are not acknowledged by\r\nthe Donee. I will not presume to quarrel with what I do not exactly\r\nunderstand; but I will be free to confess that, had I been _aware_ of\r\nthis mystery, I should have told her Majesty, on presenting the\r\nvolume, that \"I had the greater pleasure in making the offering, as\r\nher illustrious Father had been among the earliest and warmest patrons\r\nof my book-career; and that the work in question contained no\r\nfaithless account of one of the most interesting portions of her\r\ndominions.\" This copy for the Queen had a special vellum page, on\r\nwhich the Dedication, or Inscription, was printed in letters of gold.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 473: This magnificent set of books, not _all_ upon\r\n     large paper, was valued at £84. It has been since sold to\r\n     Lord Bradford.]\r\n\r\nAt length we approach the once far-famed ATTICUS: the once illustrious\r\nRICHARD HEBER, Esq., the self-ejected member of the University of\r\nOxford. Even yet I scarcely know how to handle this subject, or to\r\nexpatiate upon a theme so extraordinary, and so provocative of the\r\nmost contradictory feelings. But it were better to be brief; as, in\r\nfact, a very long account of Mr. Heber's later life will be found in\r\nmy _Reminiscences_, and there is little to add to what those pages\r\ncontain. It may be here only necessary to make mention of the sale of\r\nhis wonderful library; wonderful in all respects--not less from the\r\nvariety and importance of its contents, than from the unparalleled\r\nnumber of _duplicate volumes_--even of works of the first degree of\r\nrarity. Of the latter, it may suffice to observe that, of the editio\r\nprinceps of _Plato_, there were not fewer than _ten_ copies; and of\r\nthat of _Aristotle_, five or six copies: each the production of the\r\nAldine Press. Several of these Platonic copies were, to my knowledge,\r\nbeautiful ones; and what more than _one_ such \"beautiful copy\" need\r\nmortal man desire to possess? I believe the copy of the Plato bought\r\nat the sale of Dr. Heath's library in 1810 was, upon the whole, the\r\nmost desirable.[474] Both works are from the press of the elder Aldus.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 474: The Rt. Hon. Thomas Grenville possesses a\r\n     copy of this first edition (from the library of the Rev.\r\n     Theodore Williams) in an _uncut_ state. It may defy all\r\n     competition. There is, however, in the Spencer library, at\r\n     Althorp, described by me in the second volume of the\r\n     Bibliotheca _Spenceriana_, a very beautiful copy, delicately\r\n     ruled with red lines, which may be pronounced as almost in\r\n     its primitive state. The leaves \"discourse most eloquently\"\r\n     as you turn them over: and what sound, to the ears of a\r\n     thorough bred bibliomaniac, can be more \"musical?\"]\r\n\r\nIt may be observed, as mere preliminary matter, that it was once in\r\ncontemplation to publish the literary life of Mr. Heber; and an\r\nimpression comes across my mind that I had tendered my services for\r\nthe labour in question. The plan was however abandoned--and perhaps\r\nwisely. There was also to have been a portrait prefixed, from the\r\npencil of Mr. Masquerier, the _only_ portrait of him--in later\r\nlife--but the strangest whims and vagaries attended the surrendering,\r\nor rather the _not_ surrendering, of the portrait in question. I am in\r\npossession of a correspondence upon this subject which is perfectly\r\n_sui generis_. The library of Mr. Heber was consigned to the care and\r\ndiscretion of Messrs. Payne and Foss--booksellers of long established\r\neminence and respectability. It was merely intended to be an\r\nalphabetical, sale catalogue, with no other bibliographical details\r\nthan the scarcity or curiosity of the article warranted. It was also\r\nof importance to press the sale, or sales, with all convenient\r\ndispatch: but the mass of books was so enormous that two years\r\n(1834-6) were consumed in the dispersion of them, at home; to say\r\nnothing of what was sold in Flanders, at Paris, and at Neuremberg. I\r\nhave of late been abundantly persuaded that the acquisition of\r\nbooks--anywhere, and of whatever kind--became an ungovernable passion\r\nwith Mr. Heber; and that he was a BIBLIOMANIAC in its strict as well\r\nas enlarged sense. Of his library at Neuremberg he had never seen a\r\nvolume; but he thought well of it, as it was the identical collection\r\nreferred to by Panzer, among his other authorities, in his\r\nTypographical Annals. Of the amount of its produce, when sold, I am\r\nignorant.\r\n\r\nI have said that the Catalogue, which consisted of XII parts\r\n(exclusively of a portion of foreign books, which were sold by the\r\nlate Mr. Wheatley) was intended merely to be a sale catalogue, without\r\nbibliographical remarks; but I must except Parts II, IV, and XI: the\r\nfirst of these containing the _Drama_, the second the _English\r\nPoetry_, and the third the _Manuscripts_--which, comparatively,\r\nluxuriate in copious and apposite description. \"Si sic omnia!\" but it\r\nwere impracticable. I believe that the Manuscript Department,\r\ncomprised in about 1720 articles, produced upwards of £5000. It may\r\nnot be amiss to subjoin the following programme.\r\n\r\nPart. I.  7486  articles;  Sold by Sotheby\r\n     II.  6590    ----     Ditto\r\n    III.  5056    ----     Ditto\r\n     IV.  3067    ----     Sold by Evans\r\n      V.  5693    ----     Sold by Wheatley\r\n     VI.  4666    ----     Sold by Evans\r\n    VII.  6797    ----     Ditto\r\n   VIII.  3170    ----     Ditto\r\n     IX.  3218    ----     Sold by Sotheby\r\n      X.  3490    ----     Ditto\r\n     XI.  1717    ----     Sold by Evans\r\n    XII.  1690    ----     Sold by Wheatley\r\n\r\nFrom which it should seem, first that the total number of _articles_\r\nwas nearly _fifty three thousand_--a number that almost staggers\r\nbelief; and places the collections of Tom Rawlinson and the Earl of\r\nOxford at a very considerable distance behind; although the latter,\r\nfor _condition_ (with ONE exception), has never been equalled, and\r\nperhaps will probably never be surpassed. Secondly, if it be a\r\n_legitimate_ mode of computation--taking two books for each article,\r\none with another, throughout the entire catalogue--it will follow that\r\nthe entire library of Mr. Heber, in England, contained not fewer than\r\n_one hundred and five thousand volumes_. The _net_ amount of the SALE\r\nof this unparalleled mass of books is said to have been £55,000: a\r\nlarge sum, when the deductions from commissionship and the\r\ngovernment-tax be taken into consideration.[475] Dr. Harwood thought\r\nthat the sale of Askew Library was a remarkable one, from its bringing\r\na guinea per article--one with another--of the 4015 articles of which\r\nthe library was composed. The _history_ of the Heber Sale might\r\nfurnish materials for a little jocund volume, which can have nothing\r\nto do here; although there is more than _one_ party, mixed up with the\r\ntale, who will find anything but cause of _mirth_ in the recital. That\r\nsuch a MONUMENT, as this library, should have been suffered to crumble\r\nto pieces, without a syllable said of its owner, is, of all the\r\nmarvellous occurrences in this marvellous world, one of the most\r\nmarvellous: and to be deprecated to the latest hour. Yet, who was\r\nsurrounded by a larger troop of friends than the Individual who raised\r\nthe Monument?\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 475: These deductions, united, are about 17 per\r\n     cent.: nearly £10,000 to be deducted from the gross\r\n     proceeds.]\r\n\r\nOne anecdote may be worth recording. The present venerable and deeply\r\nlearned President of Magdalen College, Oxford, told me that, on\r\ncasting up the number of odd--or appendant volumes, (as 2 or 12 more)\r\nto the several articles in the catalogue--he found it to amount to\r\n_four thousand_. Now, primâ facie, it seems hardly credible that\r\nthere should have been _such_ a number, in _such_ a library, not\r\ndeserving of mention as distinct articles: but it must be taken into\r\nconsideration that Mr. Heber bought _many_ lots for the sake of _one_\r\nparticular book: and, considering the enormous extent of his library,\r\nit is not a very violent supposition, or inference, that these 4000\r\nvolumes were scarcely deserving of a more particular notice.\r\n\r\nPONTEVALLO was the late JOHN DENT, Esq., whose library was sold in\r\n1827; and of which library that of the late Robert Heathcote formed\r\nthe basis. It contained much that was curious, scarce, and delectable;\r\nbut the sale of it exhibited the first grand melancholy symptoms of\r\nthe decay of the Bibliomania. The Sweynheym and Pannartz Livy of 1469,\r\nUPON VELLUM, was allowed to be knocked down for £262! Mr. Evans, who\r\nhad twice before sold that identical volume--first, in the sale of Mr.\r\nEdwards's library (see _Bibliographical Decameron_, vol. iii. p.--)\r\nand secondly in that of the late Sir M.M. Sykes, Bart, (who had\r\npurchased the book for £782)--did all that human powers could do, to\r\nobtain a higher bidding--but Messrs. Payne and Foss, with little more\r\nthan the _breathing_ of competition, became the purchasers at the very\r\nmoderate sum first mentioned. From them it seemed to glide naturally,\r\nas well as necessarily, into the matchless collection of the Rt. Hon.\r\nThomas Grenville. I yet seem to hear the echo of the clapping of Sir\r\nM.M. Sykes's hands, when I was the herald of the intelligence of his\r\nhaving become the purchaser! These echoes have all died away _now_:\r\nunless indeed they are likely to be revived by a HOLFORD or a\r\nBOTTFIELD.\r\n\r\nHortensius was the late Sir WILLIAM BOLLAND, Knt.: and, a few years\r\nbefore his death, one of the Barons of his Majesty's Exchequer. He\r\ndied in his 68th year. He was an admirable man in all respects. I\r\nleave those who composed the domestic circle of which he was the\r\ndelightful focus, to expatiate upon that worth and excellence of which\r\nthey were the constant witnesses and participators--\r\n\r\n     \"He best shall _paint_ them who shall _feel_ them most.\"\r\n\r\nTo me, the humbler task is assigned of recording what is only more\r\nparticularly connected with BOOKS and VIRTU. And yet I may, not very\r\ninappositely, make a previous remark. On obtaining a seat upon the\r\nbench, the first circuit assigned to him was that of \"the Oxford.\" It\r\nproved to be heavy in the criminal Calendar: and Mr. Baron Bolland had\r\nto pass sentence of death upon three criminals. A maiden circuit is\r\nrarely so marked; and I have reason to believe that the humane and\r\nwarm-hearted feelings of the Judge were never before, or afterwards,\r\nsubjected to so severe a trial. It was a bitter and severe struggle\r\nwith all the kindlier feelings of his heart. But our theme is BOOKS.\r\nHis library was sold by public auction, under Mr. Evans's hammer, in\r\nthe autumn of 1840. One anecdote, connected with his books, is worth\r\nrecording. In my Decameron, vol. iii. p. 267, mention will be found of\r\na bundle of poetical tracts, belonging to the Chapter-library at\r\nLincoln, round which, on my second visit to that library, I had, in\r\nimitation of Captain Cox (see page -- ante), entwined some whip-cord\r\naround them--setting them apart for the consideration of the Dean and\r\nChapter, whether a _second_ time, I might not become a purchaser of\r\nsome of their book-treasures? I had valued them at fourscore guineas.\r\nThe books in question will be found mentioned in a note at page 267 of\r\nthe third volume of the Bibliographical Decameron.\r\n\r\nI had observed as follows in the work just referred to, \"What would\r\nHortensius say to the gathering of such flowers, to add to the\r\npreviously collected _Lincoln Nosegay_?\" The reader will judge of my\r\nmingled pleasure and surprise (dashed however with a few grains of\r\ndisappointment on not becoming the proprietor of them _myself_) when\r\nthe Baron, one day, after dining with him, led me to his book-case,\r\nand pointing to these precious tomes, asked me if I had ever seen them\r\n_before_? For a little moment I felt the \"Obstupui\" of Æneas. \"How is\r\nthis?\" exclaimed I. \"The secret is in the vault of the Capulets\"--replied\r\nmy Friend--and it never escaped him. \"Those ARE the identical books\r\nmentioned in your Decameron.\" Not many years afterwards I learnt from\r\nthe late Benjamin Wheatley that _he_ had procured them on a late visit\r\nto Lincoln; and that _my_ price, affixed, was taken as their just\r\nvalue. Of these Linclonian [Transcriber's Note: Lincolnian] treasures,\r\none volume alone--the Rape of Lucrece--brought ONE HUNDRED GUINEAS at\r\nthe sale of the Judge's library, beginning on the 18th of November,\r\n1840. See No. 2187; where it should seem that only four other perfect\r\ncopies are known.\r\n\r\nThe library of the late Mr. Baron Bolland, consisting of 2940\r\narticles, brought a trifle _more_ than a guinea per article. It was\r\nchoice, curious, and instructively miscellaneous. Its owner was a man\r\nof taste as well as a scholar; and the crabbed niceties of his\r\nprofession had neither chilled his heart nor clouded his judgment. He\r\nrevelled in his small cabinet of English Coins; which he placed, and\r\nalmost worshipped, among his fire-side lares. They were, the greater\r\npart of them, of precious die--in primitive lustre; and he handled\r\nthem, and expatiated on them, with the enthusiasm of a Snelling, and\r\nthe science of a Foulkes. His walls were covered with modern pictures,\r\nattractive from historical or tasteful associations. There was nothing\r\nbut what seemed to\r\n\r\n     \"point a moral, or adorn a tale.\"\r\n\r\nHis passion for books was of the largest scale and dimensions, and\r\nmarked by every species of almost enviable enthusiasm. His anecdotes,\r\nengrafted on them, were racy and sparkling; and I am not quite sure\r\nwhether it was not in contemplation by him to build a small\r\n\"_oratoire_\" to the memories of Caxton and Wynkyn De Worde. He\r\nconsidered the folios of the latter, in the fifteenth century, to be\r\nmiracles of typographical execution; and, being a poet himself, would\r\nhave been in veritable ecstacies had he lived to see the UNIQUE\r\nCHAUCER of 1498, which it was my good luck to obtain for the library\r\nof the Rt. Hon. Thomas Grenville. I will add but a few specimens of\r\nhis library--\r\n\r\nNo.                                                         £  _s._ _d._\r\n\r\n  26  Armony of Byrdes, printed by Wyght.\r\n      12mo., a poem, in six line stanzas.\r\n      Mr. Heber's copy.

In the\r\n_Decameron_, vol. iii. p. --, he appears under the more euphonous as\r\nwell as genial name of PALMERIN: but the \"hermitage\" there described\r\nhas been long deserted by its master and mistress--who have\r\ntransferred their treasures and curiosities to the sea-girt village,\r\nor rather town, of Ryde and its vicinity: where stained-glass windows\r\nand velvet bound tomes are seen to yet greater advantage. LEONTES,\r\nmentioned at page 133, was the late JAMES BINDLEY, Esq.--of whom a few\r\ninteresting particulars will be found in the third volume of my\r\n_Bibliographical Decameron_. He died before the publication of this\r\nlatter work. Sir TRISTREM was the late Sir WALTER SCOTT--then in the\r\neffulgence of poetical renown! PROSPERO was the late FRANCIS DOUCE,\r\nEsq. My Reminiscences make copious mention of these celebrated\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nAURELIUS was intended as the representative of the late GEORGE\r\nCHALMERS, Esq.--the most learned and the most celebrated of all the\r\nAntiquarians and Historians of Scotland. His CALEDONIA is a triumphant\r\nproof of his giant-powers. Never before did an author encounter such\r\nvast and various difficulties: never was such thick darkness so\r\nsatisfactorily dispersed. It is a marvellous work, in four large\r\nquarto volumes; but so indifferently printed, and upon such wretched\r\npaper, that within the next century, perhaps, not six copies of it\r\nwill be found entire. The less laborious works of Mr. Chalmers were\r\nstatistical and philological. Of the latter, his tracts relating to\r\n_Shakspeare_, and his Life of _Mary Queen of Scots_ may be considered\r\nthe principal.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Mr. George Chalmers in 1823, his nephew became\r\npossessed of his library; and on the death of the nephew, in 1841, it\r\nwas placed by the executors in the hands of Mr. Evans, who brought\r\nthe first part to sale on the 27th of September, 1841. It consisted\r\nof 2292 articles, and produced the sum of £2190. The Second Part was\r\nbrought to the same hammer, on February 27, 1842, and produced the sum\r\nof £1918 2_s._ 6_d._ It is on the _latter_ part that I am disposed to\r\ndwell more particularly, because it was so eminently rich in\r\nShakspearian lore; and because, at this present moment, the name of\r\nour immortal dramatist seems to be invested with a fresh halo of\r\nincomparable lustre. The first edition of his smaller works has\r\nacquired most extraordinary worth in the book-market. The second part\r\nof Mr. Chalmers's collection shews that the _Sonnets_ of 1595 produced\r\na hundred guineas; while the _Rape of Lucrece_ (which, perhaps, no\r\nhuman being has ever had the perseverance to read through) produced\r\n£105 in a preceding sale: see page 591.

Mr. Chalmers had frequently expressed to me his\r\nintention as well as inclination to give a complete History of the\r\nSCOTISH PRESS; and if the materials collected by him find their way\r\ninto his native country, it is to be hoped that some enterprising\r\nspirit, like that which animates the present Librarian of the Signet\r\nLibrary, will find sufficient encouragement to bring them before the\r\npublic. I bargain for a _Quarto_.\r\n\r\nMENALCAS (whose fame expands more largely in the _Bibliographical\r\nDecameron_ and _Reminiscences_) was my old and \"very singular good\r\nfriend\" the Rev. HENRY JOSEPH THOMAS DRURY, Rector of Fingest, and\r\nSecond Master of Harrow School; second, because he declined to become\r\nthe _first_. His library, so rich and rare in classical\r\nlore--manuscript as well as printed--was sold by Mr. Evans in 1827.\r\nThe catalogue contained not fewer than 4729 articles. The bindings,\r\nchiefly in Lewisian calf and morocco, were \"de toute beauté;\" and the\r\n\"oblong cabinet\" sparkled as the setting sun shot its slanting rays\r\ndown the backs of the tomes. Of this catalogue there were 35 copies\r\nonly printed upon writing paper, for presents.\r\n\r\nThis library was strikingly illustrative of the character of its LATE\r\nowner; for it is little more than a twelvemonth since he has been\r\ncalled away from that numerous and endearing circle, in the midst of\r\nwhich I saw him sitting, about a twelvemonth before his departure--the\r\nhappiest of the happy--on the day of the nuptials of his youngest\r\ndaughter but one, with Captain Beavan. His books were in fine\r\ncondition throughout--gaily attired in appropriate bindings of calf or\r\nmorocco, as the character and condition might be. His love of old\r\nclassical _Manuscripts_ was properly and greatly beyond that of\r\nprinted books: but each class was so marked and identified by his\r\ncalligraphical MS. notes, that you were in a moment convinced his\r\nbooks were not purchased for the mere sake of gorgeous furniture. So\r\nentirely were his classical feelings mixed up with his Library, that\r\nhe prefixed, over the entrance door of his oblong cabinet, in printed\r\nletters of gold, the following lines--of which the version is supplied\r\nfrom the \"_Arundines Cami_,\" edited by his eldest son, the Rev. Henry\r\nDrury.\r\n\r\n     IN MUSEI MEI ADITU.\r\n\r\n     Pontificum videas penetralibus eruta lapsis\r\n       Antiquas Monachum vellera passa manus,\r\n     Et veteres puncto sine divisore Papyros,\r\n       Quæque fremit monstris litera picta suis:\r\n     Ætatis decimæ spectes Industria Quintæ:\r\n       Quam pulcra Archetypos imprimat arte Duces\r\n     ALDINAS ædes ineuns et limina JUNTÆ\r\n       Quosque suos Stephanus vellet habere Lares.\r\n\r\n     H.I.T.D.\r\n\r\n     OVER THE THRESHOLD OF MY LIBRARY.\r\n\r\n     From mouldering Abbey's dark Scriptorium brought,\r\n     See vellum tomes by Monkish labour wrought;\r\n     Nor yet the comma born, Papyri see,\r\n     And uncial letters wizard grammary;\r\n     View my _fifteeners_ in their rugged line;\r\n     What ink! what linen! only known long syne--\r\n     Entering where ALDUS might have fixed his throne,\r\n     Or Harry Stephens covetted his own.\r\n\r\n     H.D.\r\n\r\nThey were part and parcel of the _Owner_ himself. His mind was\r\ntraceable in many a fly leaf. His latinity was perspicuity and\r\naccuracy itself. He was, in all respects, a ripe and a good scholar;\r\nand the late Provost of Eton (The Rev. Dr. Goodall) told me, on an\r\noccasion which has been, perhaps, too _emphasised_ in certain\r\nbibliographical pages,[476] that \"England could not then produce a\r\nbetter Greek metrical scholar than his friend Henry Drury.\" What was\r\nremarkable, he never assumed an _ex Cathedrâ_ position in society. In\r\nbringing forward or pressing quotations, whatever fell from him, came\r\neasily and naturally, but rarely. Accustomed for many years to be the\r\nfavourite of the _Harrovians_, he never affected the airs of the\r\npedagogue. How he _could_ criticise, sufficiently appears in an\r\narticle on the _Musæ Edinburgenses_ in an early number of the\r\nQuarterly Review.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 476: _Bibliographical Decameron._ Dr. Goodall\r\n     always appeared to me to _affect_ irascibility upon the\r\n     subject alluded to. The contents might have been published\r\n     at Charing Cross.]\r\n\r\nYet this may be considered secondary matter; and I hasten to record\r\nthe qualities of his heart and disposition. They were truly\r\nChristian-like; inasmuch as a fond and large spirit of benevolence was\r\nalways beating in his bosom, and mantling over a countenance of\r\nsingular friendliness of expression. He had the _power_ of saying\r\nsharp and caustic things, but he used his \"giant-strength\" with the\r\ngentleness of a child. His letters, of which many hundreds have fallen\r\nto my lot, are a perfect reflex of his joyous and elastic mind. There\r\nwas not a pupil under his care who looked forward to a _holiday_ with\r\nmore unqualified delight than _he_; and when we strayed together\r\nbeneath, or upon the heights of, the Dover Cliffs (where I _last_ saw\r\nhim, in the summer of 1840) he would expatiate, with equal warmth and\r\nfelicity, upon the Abbey of St. Rhadagund, and the Keep of Dover\r\nCastle. Our visit to Barfreston Church, in the neighbourhood, can\r\nnever be effaced from my mind. His mental enthusiasm and bodily\r\nactivity could not have been exceeded by that of the Captain of Harrow\r\nSchool. He took up my meditated \"History of the Dover\" as if it were\r\nhis own work; and his success, in cause of subscription, in most\r\ninstances, was complete.\r\n\r\nAnd now, after an intimacy (minutely recorded in my _Reminiscences_)\r\nof thirty-three years, it has pleased God to deprive me of his genial\r\nand heart-stirring society. His last moments were of those of a\r\nChristian--\"rooted and built up\" in THAT belief, which alone sustains\r\nus in the struggle of parting from those whom we cherish as the most\r\nidolised objects upon earth! It was towards sun-set that I first\r\npaused upon his tomb, in the church-yard, near the summit of Harrow\r\nHill. For a few moments I was breathless--but _not_ from the steepness\r\nof the ascent. The inscription, I would submit, is too much in the\r\n\"minor key.\" It was the production of his eldest son, who preferred\r\nto err from under-rating, rather than over-rating, the good qualities\r\nof his parent. For myself--\r\n\r\n     \"As those we love decay, we die in part;\r\n     String after string is severed from the heart!\"\r\n     &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\n     THOMSON.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Mr. Drury, his small library, the remains of his\r\nformer one, was sold by auction; and those classical books,\r\ninterleaved, and enriched with his manuscript notes, brought large\r\nprices. One manuscript, of especial celebrity--_Childe Harold_--given\r\nhim by the Author, his pupil, Lord Byron--became the property of its\r\npublisher, Mr. Murray; who purchased it upon terms at once marking his\r\nhigh sense of the talents of the author, and his respect for the\r\nfamily where it had been placed. It may be doubtful whether the\r\nautograph of any poem, since Paradise Lost, would have obtained a\r\nlarger sum--had it been submitted to public sale.\r\n\r\nRINALDO.--Rinaldo was the late Mr. EDWARDS; of the sale of whose\r\nlibrary an extended account will be found in my Decameron. It remains,\r\nbriefly, but emphatically, to remark, that of all the book heroes,\r\nwhose valorous achievements are here recorded, TWO only have survived\r\nthe lapse of thirty years. Let _half_ of another similar course of\r\ntime roll on, and where will the SURVIVORS be? If not at rest in their\r\ngraves, they will in all probability be \"sans teeth, sans eyes, sans\r\neverything:\"--at least, very far beyond \"the lean and slippered\r\npantaloon.\" Leaving my surviving friends to fight their own battles, I\r\nthink I may here venture to say, in quiet simplicity and singleness of\r\nheart, that books, book-sales, and book-men, will then--if I am\r\nspared--pass before me as the faint reflex of \"the light of OTHER\r\nDAYS!\" ... when literary enterprise and literary fame found a\r\nproportionate reward; and when the sickly sentimentality of the\r\nnovelist had not usurped the post of the instructive philologist. But\r\nenough of ROSICRUSIS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONSTANTIA LABORE ET]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\nTHE LIBRARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Part embraces the _History of Literature_, in the formation of\r\nLibraries, from the Conquest to the commencement of the reign of Henry\r\nVIII., and undoubtedly contains much that is curious and instructive.\r\nTwo new characters only are introduced: LORENZO and NARCOTTUS. The\r\nformer was intended to represent the late Sir Masterman Mark Sykes,\r\nBart.: the latter, a William Templeman, Esq., of Hare Hatch,\r\nBerkshire. Sir Mark Sykes was not less known than respected for the\r\nsuavity of his manners, the kindness of his disposition, and the\r\nliberality of his conduct on all matters connected with _books_ and\r\n_prints_. A long and particular account of his library, and of many of\r\nhis book-purchases, will be seen in the third volume of the\r\n_Bibliographical Decameron_; and at pages 321, 373 of my _Literary\r\nReminiscences_. His library and his prints brought, each, pretty much\r\nthe same sum: together, £60,000--an astounding result! Sir Mark is the\r\nlast great bibliomaniacal Sun that has shed its golden, as well as\r\nparting, rays, upon a terribly chap-fallen British public! Mr.\r\nTempleman, represented as Narcottus, was a great Chess-player: and\r\nalthough Caxton's \"Game at Chess\" is a mere dull morality, having\r\nnothing to do with the game strictly so called, yet he would have\r\neverything in his library where the word \"Chess\" was introduced. In\r\nthe words of the old catch, he would \"add the night unto the day\" in\r\nthe prosecution of his darling recreation, and boasted of having once\r\ngiven a signal defeat to the Rev. Mr. Bowdler, after having been\r\ndefeated himself by Lord Henry Seymour, the renowned chess-champions\r\nof the Isle of Wight. He said he once sat upon Phillidor's knee, who\r\npatted his cheek, and told him \"there was nothing like Chess and\r\nEnglish roast beef.\"\r\n\r\nThe notice of poor George Faulkner at page 199--one of the more\r\ncelebrated book-binders of the day, is amplified at page 524 of the\r\nsecond volume of the Decameron; where the painful circumstances\r\nattending his death are slightly mentioned. He yet lives, and lives\r\nstrongly, in my remembrance. Since then, indeed within a very few\r\nyears, the famous CHARLES LEWIS--of whose bibliopegistic renown the\r\nDecameronic pages have expatiated fully--has ceased to be. He was\r\ncarried off suddenly by an apoplectic seizure. His eldest son--a sort\r\nof \"spes altera Romæ,\" in his way--very quickly followed the fate of\r\nhis father. The name of LEWIS will be always held high in the\r\nestimation of bibliopegistic Virtuosi. But the art of Book-binding is\r\nnot deteriorating: and I am not sure whether JOHN CLARKE, of Frith\r\nStreet, Soho, be not as \"mighty a man\" in his way as any of his\r\npredecessors. There is a solidity, strength, and squareness of\r\nworkmanship about his books, which seem to convince you that they may\r\nbe tossed from the summit of Snowdon to that of Cader Idris without\r\ndetriment or serious injury. His gilding is first rate; both for\r\nchoice of ornament and splendour of gold. Nor is his coadjutor,\r\nWILLIAM BEDFORD, of less potent renown. He was the great adjunct of\r\nthe late Charles Lewis--and imbibes the same taste and the same spirit\r\nof perseverance. Accident brought me one morning in contact with a set\r\nof the New Dugdale's Monasticon, bound in blue morocco, and most\r\ngorgeously bound and gilded, lying upon the table of Mr. James Bohn--a\r\nmountain of bibliopegistic grandeur! A sort of irrepressible awe kept\r\nyou back even from turning over the coats or covers! And what a\r\nWORK--deserving of pearls and precious stones in its outward\r\ngarniture! \"Who was the happy man to accomplish such a piece of\r\nbinding?\"[477] observed I. \"Who BUT John Clarke?\"--replied the\r\nBibliopole.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 477: Good binding--even Roger-Payne-binding--is\r\n     gadding abroad every where. At Oxford, they have \"a spirit\"\r\n     of this description who loses a night's rest if he haplessly\r\n     shave off the sixteenth part of an inch of a rough edge of\r\n     an uncut Hearne. My friend, Dr. Bliss, has placed volumes\r\n     before me, from the same mintage, which have staggered\r\n     belief as an indigenous production of Academic soil. At\r\n     Reading, also, some splendid leaves are taken from the same\r\n     _Book_. Mr. Snare, the publisher, keeps one of the most\r\n     talented bookbinders in the kingdom--from the school of\r\n     Clarke; and feeds him upon something more substantial than\r\n     rose leaves and jessamine blossoms. He is a great man for a\r\n     halequin's jacket: and would have gone crazy at the sight of\r\n     some of the specimens at Strawberry Hill. No man can put a\r\n     varied-coloured morocco coat upon the back of a book with\r\n     greater care, taste, and success, than our Reading\r\n     Bibliopegist.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V.\r\n\r\nTHE DRAWING-ROOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Part is a copious continuation of the History of Book Collectors\r\nand Collections up to the year 1810. There is nothing to add in the\r\nway of CHARACTER; and the subject itself is amply continued in the\r\ntenth day of the _Bibliographical Decameron_. In both works will be\r\nfound, it is presumed, a fund of information and amusement, so that\r\nthe Reader will scarcely demand an extension of the subject. Indeed, a\r\nlittle volume would hardly suffice to render it the justice which it\r\nmerits; but I am bound to make special mention of the untameable\r\nperseverance, and highly refined taste, of B.G. Windus, Esq., one of\r\nmy earliest and steadiest supporters; and yet, doth he not rather take\r\nup a sitting in the ALCOVE--amongst _Illustrators of fine Works_?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CAVE OF DESPAIR.\r\n\r\n_Drawn by J. Thurston.--Engraved by Robert Branston._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VI.\r\n\r\nTHE ALCOVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA word only:--and that respecting _Illustrated Copies_. Leaving Mr.\r\nWindus in full possession of his Raphael Morghens, William Woollets,\r\nWilliam Sharpes, &c.--and allowing him the undisturbed relish of\r\ngazing upon, and pressing to his heart's core, his _grey_ TURNERS--let\r\nme only introduce to the reader's critical attention and admiration\r\nthe opposite subject, executed by the late Mr. Branston, and\r\nexhibiting _The Cave of Despair_ from Spenser's Fairy Queen. The\r\nfigures were drawn on the blocks by the late J. Thurston, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=Illustrated Copies.=\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the _Illustration_-Symptom of Bibliomania, a fund of amusing\r\nanecdote, as well as of instructive detail, presents itself. We may\r\ntravel in a carriage and four--from morn 'till night--and sweep county\r\nafter county, in pursuit of all that is exquisite, and rare, and\r\nprecious, and unattainable in other quarters: but I doubt if our\r\nhorses' heads can be turned in a direction better calculated to answer\r\nall the ends in view than in front of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAVENSBURY LODGE, LOWER MITCHAM,]\r\n\r\nthe residence of the late proprietor of this work. There we once\r\nbeheld such a copy of the best of all existing _Encyclopædias_--that\r\nof the late Dr. REES--as is no where else to be found. It was upon\r\n_large_ and _fine_ paper--bound in fourscore volumes--with separately\r\nexecuted title pages, in a style of pure art--and _illustrated_ with\r\nnot fewer than TEN THOUSAND EXTRA PLATES. The reader may, and will,\r\nnaturally enough, judge of the wide, if not boundless, field for\r\nillustration--comprehending in fact (as the title of the work\r\ndenounces) the circle of all knowledge, arts and sciences; but he can\r\nhave no idea of the _manner_ in which this fertile and illimitable\r\nfield is filled up, till he gazes upon the copy in question. Here then\r\nwas not only a _reading_, but a _graphic_, LIBRARY IN ITSELF. Whatever\r\nother works _profusely_ dilate upon was here _concentrated_--and\r\ndeeply impressed upon the mind by the charm, as well as the\r\nintelligence, of graphical ornament. You seemed to want nothing, as,\r\nupon the turning over of every leaf, the prodigality of art ennobled,\r\nwhile it adorned, the solidity of the text. You have kept your horses\r\nalready waiting three hours--and they are neighing and snorting for\r\nfood: and you must turn them into the stable for suitable\r\nprovender--for the owner of this production would tell you that you\r\nhad scarcely traversed through one-third of the contents of the\r\nvolumes. He orders an additional fowl to be placed on the spit, and an\r\nextra flagon of Combe and Delafield's brightest ale to be\r\nforth-coming: while his orchard supplies the requisite addenda of\r\nmulberries, pears, and apples, to flank the veritable Lafitte. You\r\ndrink and are merry. Then comes the Argand Lamp; and down with the\r\nEncyclopedistic volumes. The plates look brighter and more beautiful.\r\nThere is no end of them--nor limits to your admiration. Be it summer\r\nor winter, there is food for sustenance, and for the gratification of\r\nthe most exquisite palate. To contemplate SUCH a performance, the\r\nthorough-bred book-votary would travel by torch-light through\r\nforty-eight hours of successive darkness!...: But the horses are again\r\nneighing--for their homes. You must rouse the slumbering post-boy: for\r\n\"The bell of the church-clock strikes ONE.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nP.S.--The late Mr. WALMSLEY--who employed me to print this present\r\nedition--narrowly watched all our movements, and was much gratified by\r\nthe appearance of the work, so far as it had gone before his\r\ndeath--frequently urged me to append a short account of the progress\r\nof our art during the last thirty years--i.e. since the publication of\r\nthe former edition of _Bibliomania_.\r\n\r\nThe subject is too diffuse for a mere note: and during the life-time\r\nof so many able printers as now exercise their calling in the\r\nmetropolis, it would be invidious to particularize eminence in our\r\nprofession (whereas among our immediate predecessors it is, perhaps\r\njust to say that there were only _two_ printers of great celebrity,\r\nthe late _Mr. Bulmer_ and my late father). I shall therefore merely\r\nmention some events which have had such influence on our art as that\r\nthe case is now very different to what it was thirty years ago, when\r\nthe good execution of printing at once testified to the skill and\r\nindustry of the printer--as he could command neither good _presses_,\r\n_types_, nor _ink_, &c.--paper being then almost the only matter to be\r\nhad in perfection.\r\n\r\nWe have _now_ excellent and powerful iron presses--Stanhopes,\r\nColumbians, Imperials, &c. _Then_ the celebrated specimens of\r\ntypography were produced by _miserable_ wooden presses. We have _now_\r\nink of splendid lustre, at a fourth of the cost of fabrication\r\n_then_--for both Mr. Bulmer and my father were perpetually trying\r\nexpensive experiments--and not always succeeding: our ink is now to be\r\ndepended on for _standing_, it works freely, and can be had at\r\nreasonable prices at the extensive factory of Messrs. SHACKELL and\r\nLYONS, Clerkenwell, who made the ink used for this work.\r\n\r\nThere are several eminent engineers who make the best of presses. Our\r\n_letter_ may safely be pronounced, if not perfect, as near perfection\r\nas it will ever reach--and while the celebrated type-foundries of\r\nMessrs. CASLON, Chiswell Street, and Messrs. FIGGINS, West Street, are\r\nwithin the reach of the metropolitan printers, there can be no excuse\r\nfor failing to execute good printing on the score of inferior type.\r\n\r\nThe substitution of the _inking roller_, instead of the cumbrous and\r\ninconvenient old balls, has much eased the labours of the pressman and\r\nfacilitated the regularity of colour. The inking roller at the hand\r\npress was adopted, and offered to the printers generally, by my\r\nfriend, Mr. APPLEGATH, shortly after _steam-printing_ was introduced\r\nby my father--about which so much has been said in periodical\r\npublications, &c., that it is needless here to enlarge on the\r\nsubject--more especially as it is principally applicable to work of\r\ninferior character, newspapers, reviews, magazines, &c.; and, further,\r\nit is not a very tempting subject to the son of him who was led to\r\ndevote the energies of the latter years of his active life, and the\r\nwell-earned fortune which his great typographical celebrity had\r\nsecured, to the adoption of a mode of printing which, how much soever\r\nit may benefit newspaper proprietors and others--certainly has done\r\nany thing but benefit his family; and has thus added another instance\r\nto the many on record of the ill success attending the patronage of\r\ninventors.\r\n\r\nB.
