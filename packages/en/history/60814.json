As argument, it reveals that\r\nBohemian character, citing the place of Bohemia in the art of citizenship,\r\nin the power of self-control, in its national ideals, in its policies of\r\naccommodation to the plans of neighboring states, in its contribution to\r\nthe world of creative arts, and in its personal views of national duty and\r\nresponsibility. As appeal it enumerates, point by point, the injustice of\r\nmany years of Hapsburg rule, and sets out in clear light the many reasons\r\nwhy the Bohemians deserve freedom.”\r\n\r\n                                                    --_Washington Star._\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                  THE\r\n                               historie\r\n                                  of\r\n                                BOHEMIA.\r\n\r\n                            _THE FIRST PARTE._\r\n                                describing\r\n                          THE COVNTRYE SCITVATION,\r\n                           climate, commodities,\r\n                    _the name and nature of the people_\r\n                        AND COMPENDIOVSLY CONTINVĪG\r\n                _the Historie from the from the begining of_\r\n                         the Nation to their first\r\n                          Christian Prince about\r\n                             _the yeare of_\r\n                                Christ\r\n                                  990\r\n\r\nThe History of Bohemia\r\n\r\nHarleian MS., British Museum.

Consistently a\r\nphonetic tongue, it is pronounced as it is written.\r\n\r\nThe vowels are pronounced as in Italian.\r\n\r\nInvariably the accent falls on the first syllable, irrespective of the\r\nlength of the word.\r\n\r\nBefore Hus’s time Bohemian orthography resembled somewhat that of the\r\npresent day Polish. By introducing the diacritic mark, the reformer did\r\naway with groups of consonants such as cs, cz.\r\n\r\nThe diacritic mark occurs on the following letters: á, é, č, ď, í, ň, ř,\r\nš, ť, ú, ů, ý, ž. Ď and ó are used least of all. The mark tends alike to\r\nsoften and shade the sound of the letter.\r\n\r\n  á is pronounced long as in darling.\r\n  é as a in care.\r\n  ě as ye in yellow.\r\n  č as ch in cherry.\r\n  í and ý as ee in tree.\r\n  ň as ñ in cañon.\r\n  ř is thought to be unpronounceable by a non-Bohemian.\r\n\r\nThe Germans taunt the Bohemians with the ř. The rsh in Pershing approaches\r\nthe sound though it does not quite express it.\r\n\r\n  š as sh in shall.\r\n  ú and ů long as in rule.\r\n  ž as in j in the French word jour.\r\n  ch as in the Scottish loch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt sounds incredible, yet it is literally true, that every Slavic nation\r\nwas, before the war, and probably still is, better known to the English\r\nspeaking people than the Bohemians (Čechs). What is the reason? That the\r\nBohemians, who are the most literate of all the Slavs, have remained\r\nundiscovered may be attributed to three main causes: They are not a free\r\nnation. They are a landlocked nation. They are rated a small nation.\r\n\r\nThe opportunities which a seacoast offers to a people, to mention the\r\nDutch, Irish, Belgians, Norwegians, Swedes and Danes, all of whom are\r\nnumerically smaller than the Bohemian-Slovaks are inestimable. In the\r\nforum of world’s commerce and politics, the sea is their powerful sponsor.\r\nTo a landlocked people this great boon is denied. Inland nations may reach\r\nthe outside world through an intermediary only, and if that intermediary\r\nhappens to be a powerful and ungenerous state, the policy of which is to\r\nkeep its little neighbor in the background, the consequences are obvious.\r\n\r\nThat there live in Central Europe Teutons and none others but Teutons was\r\nbeing daily demonstrated to the Americans by a most convincing proof.\r\nAlmost every box of merchandise shipped here from that part of the world\r\nbore the tell-tale mark “Made in Germany.” Rarely one saw at the terminals\r\ngoods labelled “Made in Austria,” and rarer still, “Made in Bohemia.” And\r\nyet many an article of merchandise thus marked was really made in Bohemia,\r\nfor parts of Bohemia teem with all kinds of wonderful industries.\r\n\r\nBecause of centuries of political and economic subjection, the very\r\nexistence of the nation has been lost sight of by the Anglo-Saxons. In\r\nthe interval between the catastrophal defeat of the Bohemians in 1620 and\r\n1848, the year of revolutionary changes, nothing has occurred in Bohemia\r\nto attract the attention of the world to the Bohemian nation. The Seven\r\nYears’ War, and later the Napoleonic Wars, were events that concerned not\r\nBohemia as an independent state, but the whole of the Hapsburg Empire. The\r\nRussians acquired renown in the first quarter of the nineteenth century\r\nby their defeat of Napoleon. Later, during the Crimean War, Russia again\r\ncame into prominence in the Anglo-American press. Kosciuszko and Pulaski\r\nwere names to be conjured with by the Polish immigrant. The uprisings\r\nin 1830 and in 1863 made sufficiently known to the Americans the ideals\r\nand the miseries of Poland. The Russo-Turkish War of 1877 and the Berlin\r\nCongress following it made the English reader familiar with the geography\r\nand political ambitions of the Balkan Slavs. The Serbs, the Bulgars,\r\nthe Montenegrines were successively introduced to the newspaper man\r\nand through him to the public at large. Alone the Bohemians remained\r\nundiscovered, unknown.\r\n\r\nBefore the war the average reader did not know where Bohemia was located\r\nwith respect to Austria-Hungary. That ethnically, there might be a\r\ndifference between a Čech, Hungarian and an Austrian he suspected, yet it\r\nwas not wholly clear to him wherein the dissimilarity lay. One could cite\r\ncountless instances of astonishing naiveté concerning the history of the\r\nnations which inhabit central and southeastern Europe. Four years ago a\r\njournalist and a writer who served on the western front in the capacity of\r\na war correspondent made the astounding discovery that “the ancient Czech\r\n(Bohemian) language still continues to be spoken in Prague.” It would no\r\ndoubt amuse a Dutchman to read that “Dutch is still spoken in Amsterdam”;\r\nyet transpose Dutch for Bohemian and Prague for Amsterdam and the analogy\r\nis precise. When one remembers with what fine scorn an American looked\r\ndown upon that corner of Europe, which in his opinion exhibited altogether\r\ntoo many superfluous boundary dots, one begins to realize what thankless,\r\nalmost futile task it was to talk to him of the trials, ambitions and\r\ntriumphs of the Bohemian O’Connells, Emmets, Shelleys, Macauleys and\r\nHallams. With the rest, the Bohemians had to pay the penalty of being\r\nthought a small nation.\r\n\r\nAgain there are the Bohemians and bohemians and how to differentiate\r\nbetween the two is still a puzzle to a considerable portion of the public.\r\nAre all the Bohemians artists, who “secede from conventionality in life\r\nand art”? That even cultured--let us not hope educated--Americans and\r\nEnglishmen entertain the weird notion that there exists some distant\r\nrelationship between Bohemians, bohemians and gypsies, is, alas, too\r\ntrue. In the novel _Strathmore_, Louise de la Ramée (Ouida) for instance,\r\nasserts quite seriously that gypsies in Bohemia have Slavonic features,\r\nthat their language is a dialect of the Bohemian and that the “lawless,\r\nvagrant, savage race” is a Slavic tribe domiciled in Bohemia.\r\n\r\nNot a few are misled by the term Czech, thinking it probably signifies\r\na people other than the Bohemians. A New York paper, in enumerating the\r\ndisaffected races of Austria-Hungary, named the Bohemians _and_ the\r\nCzechs. This is precisely like saying Yankees _and_ Americans or Germans\r\n_and_ Teutons, for, as informed readers are aware Bohemians and the Czechs\r\nare one and the same.[1]\r\n\r\n  [1] The race name of the Slavic inhabitants of Bohemia in the native\r\n  language is _Čech_ (singular), _Čechové_ (plural). The country is called\r\n  _Čechy_. _Čech_ is pronounced nearly like Chech (the last ch as in the\r\n  Scottish loch). The use of the form Czech should be discouraged, inasmuch\r\n  as it wholly fails to bring out the proper sound. The _Cambridge Modern\r\n  History_, a distinguished work, adheres consistently to the spelling\r\n  Č-e-c-h.\r\n\r\nOf the continental nations, Germany excepted, the French were the first\r\nto look inquiringly into the queer Austrian household. No doubt they\r\nwere led to study Slavic Austria largely because of their alliance with\r\nRussia and because of their historical friendship for the Poles. Due to\r\nthe labor of three pioneers, Saint-René Taillandier (1817-1879), Louis\r\nLeger (1843-) and Ernest Denis (1849-) _La Nation Tchèque_ is no longer\r\nunknown in France. Other and younger Frenchmen,--to name one, André\r\nChéradame, the author of the widely quoted volume, _The Pangerman Plot\r\nUnmasked_,--continue the apostolary work in France; but Taillandier, Leger\r\nand Denis will always be honored as the pioneers of this propaganda. Of\r\nthe trio, Ernest Denis, Professor of the Sorbonne, stands closest to\r\nthe Bohemian heart. Denis’ monumental researches, _Huss et la Guerre\r\ndes Hussites_, _La Bohême depuis la Montagne Blanche_, and _Fin de\r\nl’indépendance Bohême_, when published, may be said to have caused a\r\nsensation. Unhampered by the censor, Denis was able to bring out facts\r\nof Bohemia’s past which were a revelation to the Bohemians themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Saxon who visited the Hapsburg dominions thirty or forty years\r\nago was yet unable to see anything but Teuton Austria; that is to say, he\r\nlooked at Bohemia and the other Austrian states wholly from the official\r\nviewpoint of Vienna.\r\n\r\nAs a sample of the notions of Bohemia and the Čechs professed in America\r\nand England a generation ago, suffice it to cite a passage or two from\r\nBayard Taylor’s _Views A-Foot_, or _Europe seen with Knapsack and Staff_:\r\n“The very name of Bohemia is associated with wild and wonderful legends,\r\nof the rude barbaric ages. The civilized race, the Saxon race, was left\r\nbehind; I saw around me the features and heard the language of one of\r\nthose rude Slavonian tribes whose original home was on the vast steppes\r\nof Central Asia(!)” Again: “In passing the shrines by the wayside, the\r\npoor degraded peasants always uncovered or crossed themselves, but it\r\nappeared to be rather the effect of habit than any good impulse for the\r\nBohemians are noted all over Germany for their dishonesty....”\r\n\r\nTaylor’s grossly distorted appraisal of Bohemia was not shared by Henry\r\nWadsworth Longfellow, as appears from the following lines by the famous\r\nAmerican poet:\r\n\r\n   “Hold your tongues! both\r\n    Swabian and Saxon,\r\n    A bold Bohemian cries;\r\n    If there’s a heaven upon this earth,\r\n    In Bohemia it lies.”\r\n\r\nOvernight the Great War has changed many a wrong notion. “Time changes\r\nall, and by time is truth to victory guided; what in their errors the\r\nyears planned, in a day is o’erthrown,” prophetically sings John Kollár,\r\nthe great Slovak poet. Following the example of the French, several\r\nEnglish and American writers, Henry Wickham Steed, R. W. Seton-Watson and\r\nWill S. Monroe among them, have in recent years paid visits to Bohemia,\r\nand the result is both surprising and gratifying. It is certain that, once\r\naroused, Anglo-Saxon curiosity will not abate until it has learned all\r\nabout Bohemia, even though the knowledge obtained may disagree with the\r\nAlice in Wonderland tales that have been related in Vienna to the old\r\ntime British and American travelers.\r\n\r\nA new development in the study of Bohemia and her people by foreigners\r\nmay be said to date from the time the dual system of government was\r\nintroduced (1867). Until then the interest of scholars was confined wholly\r\nto historic and sectarian questions; from that time on, political and\r\nethnological issues began to engage their serious attention.\r\n\r\nThe present bibliography lists, besides books and pamphlets, magazine\r\narticles only; it does not pretend to register items appearing in the\r\nweekly, much less in the daily press. To attempt the latter would be\r\nbeyond the scope and purpose of the catalogue. Exceptions to the rule have\r\nbeen made in favor of articles bearing the signature of authors who are\r\nknown to be especially qualified to discuss the subjects selected by them.\r\n\r\nScarcely a book has been written on Austria or the Slavs which does not,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, discuss Bohemia and the Čechs. The catalogue\r\ncannot take cognizance of such publications, although, in this respect\r\nalso, the rule has been relaxed and books have been indexed, dealing\r\nbroadly with Austria and the Slavs. Colquhoun’s _The Whirlpool of Europe:\r\nAustria-Hungary and the Hapsburgs_, Steed’s _The Hapsburg Monarchy_ and\r\nSeton-Watson’s _German, Slav, and Magyar_ may be cited as typical examples\r\nof these publications.\r\n\r\nQuite correctly the spelling of proper names, though obsolescent, has\r\nbeen left undisturbed. The Bohemians spell Hus, not Huss; Žižka, not\r\nZisca. Comenius is a Latinized form dating back to an age when it was the\r\ncustom to Latinize one’s surname; the real name is Komenský and Bohemian\r\nhistory knows the educator by this name only.\r\n\r\nThe authors have availed themselves of the skilled services of Leonard\r\nC. Wharton, who was asked to look into the rare Bohemica preserved in\r\nthe British Museum. Mr. Wharton performed this part of the work with\r\npainstaking care.\r\n\r\nMany of the seventeenth century items have been extracted from the\r\n_British Museum Catalogue of Printed Books_. _The Catalogue of the\r\nHarleian Manuscripts_ in the British Museum has yielded _The Historie\r\nof Bohemia_, written presumably in the first quarter of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. Items of minor value were obtained from the _State Papers of John\r\nThurloe_; the _Harleian Miscellany, or a collection of scarce, curious and\r\nentertaining Pamphlets and Tracts_; Robert Watts’ _Bibliotheca Britannica,\r\nor a General Index to British and Foreign Literature_. For numerous\r\ncurrent items the authors are indebted to _Poole’s Index to Periodical\r\nLiterature_ and the _Readers’ Guide to Periodical Literature_.\r\n\r\nThe reader will probably agree with the present authors that but for\r\nBohemia’s Protestant past, Anglo-American Bohemica would be practically\r\nnon-existent. Strip the source book of Hus, of the events which followed\r\nthe Reformation and the anti-Reformation, of the United Brethren and\r\ntheir alleged offspring, the Moravians, of Komenský, and Bohemia would\r\nstand before the Anglo-American world like Cinderella from the fairy\r\ntale--unwritten about, still waiting to be discovered.\r\n\r\nThe bibliography proper is subdivided into twenty-two parts, a brief\r\nand relevant comment accompanying each part. The respective sub-titles\r\nare: Art, Bibliography, Biography, Bohemian Glass, Dictionaries, Drama,\r\nFiction, Folk and Fairy Tales, Guides, History, John Hus, John Amos\r\nKomenský, Language and Literature, Miscellany, Music, Periodicals, Plans\r\nand Maps, Politics, Prague, Sociology and Economics, Sokols, Travel\r\nand Description. A separate chapter, entitled Bohemia in the British\r\nState Papers and Manuscripts, contains bibliographical extracts from\r\nthe _Calendar of State Papers_, the _Reports of the British Historical\r\nManuscripts Commission_, the _Reports of the Royal Commission on\r\nHistorical Manuscripts_, _Papal Registers_, etc.\r\n\r\nThe especial acknowledgments of the authors are due to Prof. Will\r\nS. Monroe, author of _Bohemia and the Čechs_, and to Mr. Leonard C.\r\nWharton of London. Prof. Monroe kindly read and compared with his own,\r\nthe bibliography on Komenský. The material which Mr. Wharton has sent\r\nfrom England emphasizes anew the enthusiastic interest he takes in the\r\nlanguage, history and literature of the Bohemian people.\r\n\r\nART. Reference is made in this biographical manual to the work of three\r\nartists. The first is Václav Holar of Prácheň, or Wenceslaus Hollar, as\r\nhis name was spelled in England. A Protestant exile, whom the edicts of\r\nanti-reformation had driven from his home, Hollar drifted to England,\r\nwhere he gained the reputation as the foremost etcher of his time.\r\nHis plates, which number about 2,400 pieces, are highly prized by art\r\ncollectors. “He drew plans, prospects and portraits; habits and dresses;\r\nchurches, monuments and antiquaries, or etched designs by famous Italian,\r\nGerman, Dutch and English masters, some done from the collection of King\r\nCharles I. and especially from those belonging to Thomas Earl of Arundel,\r\nwho brought Hollar to and supported him in England.” (Vertue). Born in\r\n1607 in Prague, he was buried in St. Margaret’s, Westminster, 28th of\r\nMarch, 1677. He showed the lasting attachment to his fatherland by signing\r\nmany of his works “Wenceslaus Hollar Bohemus.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Anne of Bohemia (1366-1394)\r\n\r\nDaughter of Charles IV., wife of Richard II. of England]\r\n\r\nVáclav Brožík (1851-1901) was a noted painter of historic subjects. His\r\ngreatest picture is “Master John Hus condemned to death by the Council\r\nof Constance,” now the property of the municipality of Prague. American\r\nart lovers will remember Brožík’s “Defenestration, or thrown from the\r\nwindow at Prague,” exhibited at the Chicago World’s Fair. The New York\r\nMetropolitan Museum of Art owns a large canvas by him, “Columbus at the\r\nCourt of Ferdinand and Isabella.” The Lenox Library (now the New York\r\nPublic Library) has “Rudolph II. in the Laboratory of his Alchymist,” and\r\n“The Grandmother’s Namesday.” “As a historical painter, Brožík equals\r\nthe greatest by his breadth of conception, fine composition, strength of\r\nwork and dramatic effect.” This is the estimate of the painter by Mr.\r\nLarroument, Secretary of the French _Académie des Beaux Arts_. For his art\r\ngalleries in New York and Philadelphia, John Wanamaker purchased several\r\nof the artist’s smaller themes, and from his executors the entire contents\r\nof his Paris studio, studies, sketches, antiques, draperies and hangings.\r\n\r\nAlfons M. Mucha, born in 1860 in Moravia, earned his spurs in Paris as\r\na poster artist. He is not unknown in the United States, having visited\r\nthis country on two or three occasions, working here as portraitist,\r\nillustrator and interior decorator. For several years he has been engaged\r\non a series of allegories intended to portray the historical development\r\nof the Slavs. When finished, the canvases are to be presented to the City\r\nof Prague as the gift of the well-known Slavophile, Charles R. Crane of\r\nChicago and New York.\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY. So far as the writers know, no one has before this concerned\r\nhimself with a systematic compilation of a bibliography of this kind. The\r\nlate Herman Rosenthal, Director of the Slavonic Department of the New York\r\nPublic Library, is said to have been at work on a Slavic bibliography;\r\nbut his literary executors have not yet published it. Dr. A. Sum, member\r\nof the English Club in Prague, has taken more than a passing interest in\r\nEnglish Bohemica. The late Jeffrey D. Hrbek, an exceptionally gifted young\r\nman (see his biography published posthumously), prepared for the _Osvěta\r\nAmerická_ (1908) what was then considered to be a fairly exhaustive\r\nbibliography. The list mentions ninety volumes, many of them containing\r\nbut remote and irrelevant allusions to Bohemia. The bibliography appended\r\nto Miss Balch’s _Our Slavic Fellow Citizens_ is quite considerable;\r\nhowever, this work treats not of Bohemians alone, but of all the Slavs,\r\nand, when the process of elimination is applied, it will be seen that the\r\npurely Bohemian share of reference books is small. Then there is Leonard\r\nC. Wharton’s list, printed in the _Guide to the Kingdom of Bohemia_; this\r\ntakes notice of thirty-five items. As regards the Hus and the Moravian\r\nChurch literatures, Wm. Gunn Malin’s catalogue is, without doubt, the\r\nrichest and the most valuable of all.\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHY. Biographical material in the several encyclopædias is meagre\r\nand perfunctory and what there is of it has been chiefly extracted\r\nfrom German lexicons. Count Lützow edited items on Bohemia for the\r\n_Encyclopædia Britannica_. J. J. Král has written for _Johnson’s Universal\r\nCyclopædia_ short biographical sketches of several authors--Jungmann,\r\nKollár, Němcová, Neruda and the Jirečeks among them. The _Biographical\r\nDictionary of the Library of the World’s Best Literature_ contains the\r\nlives of some two dozen men of letters. Injudiciously the editor of the\r\n_Biographical Dictionary_ has included among Bohemian (Čech) writers\r\nCharles Sealsfield (pseudonym of Karl Anton Postl, by some written Postel)\r\nand Fritz Mauthner. While it is true that the first named was born in\r\nMoravia and the other in Bohemia, both Sealsfield and Mauthner were, as a\r\nmatter of fact, Germans.\r\n\r\nP. Selver in his _Anthology of Modern Bohemian Poetry_ gives, besides\r\nspecimens of their verse, an illuminating account of the lives of a number\r\nof poets. The biographies of the literary workers of old Bohemia are\r\ntreated adequately in Lützow’s _History of Bohemian Literature_.\r\n\r\nNo Čech has been more written about than Hus; and, incidentally, none\r\nhas shed greater lustre on his native land than he. Every volume dealing\r\nwith the causes and effects of the Reformation necessarily considers\r\nHus’s part therein. Associated with Hus usually appears the name of his\r\nfellow-martyr, Jerome of Prague.\r\n\r\nBiographies of Komenský are not wanting, for which thanks are due\r\nprincipally to educators the world over, who regard Komenský’s writings as\r\nmilestones in the progress of education.\r\n\r\nMusic, speaking as it does a language which is universally understood,\r\nhas granted a passport to Anton Dvořák and in a lesser degree to Bedřich\r\nSmetana and Zděnek Fibich.\r\n\r\nThe interested public will find many portraits and life sketches in\r\nVicker’s, Gregor’s, Maurice’s and Monroe’s volumes. Some have been\r\npublished in _The Bohemian Voice_; however, complete files of this\r\nmagazine are now exceedingly rare.\r\n\r\nBOHEMIAN GLASS is renowned everywhere for its excellence and beauty.\r\nThe industry is an old one and there are some two thousand shops and\r\nfactories in the country engaged in the making of it. As an export article\r\nBohemian glass constitutes a major item.\r\n\r\nDICTIONARIES. GRAMMARS. INTERPRETERS. Adolf William Straka, (died in\r\nLondon in 1872), a political exile, who lived for years in England,\r\nbecoming a British subject, was the first to write an _English Bohemian\r\nGrammar_. It was printed in Prague in 1862.\r\n\r\nThe first English Bohemian dictionary, by Charles Jonáš, was published\r\nin Racine, Wisconsin. Before emigrating to the United States in 1863,\r\nJonáš spent some time in London. In the English metropolis he associated\r\nwith Straka and the inference is that the author of the _English Bohemian\r\nGrammar_ inspired a liking for lexicographical work in his younger\r\nfellow-exile.\r\n\r\nCharles Jonáš, the “first Bohemian in America” was born in 1840 and died\r\nabroad in 1896 while serving the United States in the capacity of Consul.\r\nHe was buried in Prague, “in the land he loved above all else.” Although\r\nhe was not a philologist by training, having studied in a technological\r\ninstitute, he plunged courageously into lexicography. His introductory\r\nwork was the _Bohemian English Interpreter_ (1865), followed by the\r\n_Dictionary of the English and Bohemian Languages_ (1876). Like every\r\ninitial effort, the dictionary was deficient in many respects. Each\r\nsucceeding edition, however, was improved and amplified, so that now\r\nJonáš’ dictionaries compare favorably with like German publications.\r\nOther American Bohemians have achieved political distinction in the\r\nUnited States (Jonáš was successively State Senator, Lieutenant Governor\r\nof Wisconsin and U. S. Consul at Prague), yet Jonáš the journalist, Jonáš\r\nthe author, Jonáš the politician had not, in the estimation of pioneer\r\nimmigrants, an equal among his American co-nationals.\r\n\r\nF. B. Zdrůbek’s _Anglická mluvnice_ (1870) is the earliest publication\r\nof its kind in America. Crude typographically and faulty textually, the\r\nvolume is a compliment neither to the printer nor to the author. Jonáš and\r\nZdrůbek, one will observe, worked along parallel lines. This is explained\r\nby the circumstance that the two men were attached to two rival newspaper\r\nand printing concerns--Jonáš to the weekly _Slavie_ published in Racine,\r\nand Zdrůbek to the daily _Svornost_ of Chicago.\r\n\r\nF. B. Zdrůbek, for over thirty years editor of the Chicago _Svornost_,\r\nand one of the leaders of the Bohemian rationalists in the United States,\r\nwas born in 1842 and died in Chicago in 1911. He took a course first in a\r\nCatholic, then in a Protestant theological seminary. Convinced that “as\r\na minister of the gospel he could not make an honorable living unless\r\nhe chose to make of his vocation a vulgar traffic and practiced from\r\nthe pulpit pious extortion,” as he wrote in his autobiography, he gave\r\nup the ministry and devoted himself to journalism. Most prolific of all\r\nthe American Bohemian men of letters, Zdrůbek was in fact not a creative\r\nwriter but a translator. As a journalist he was distinctly commonplace.\r\n\r\nJaroslav J. Zmrhal, teacher in a Chicago school, has given the public in\r\nhis _Anglicky snadno ve třiceti úlohách_, one of the best hand-books for\r\nthe learning of the English language thus far compiled. Zmrhal’s method of\r\npronunciation is clearly an improvement over all previous books; certainly\r\nit is superior to Zdrůbek’s, who after all, possessed but a book knowledge\r\nof English.\r\n\r\nLast, but not least, is a comprehensive _Učebnice_ by F. Francl of New\r\nYork. Altogether it may be stated that grammars and interpreters by\r\nAmerican Bohemians who know alike the vocabulary and the spirit of the\r\nEnglish tongue, are more serviceable, if not wholly superior to most of\r\nthe “English Easy and Quick” hand-books which have been published in\r\nPrague.\r\n\r\nThe most versatile linguist in Bohemia was Francis Vymazal (1841-1917),\r\nwho compiled a lengthy row of manuals of the “English at a glance” type.\r\nVymazal’s series includes the study of English, Bulgarian, Russian,\r\nFrench, Hebrew, Dutch, Latin, Magyar, German, Gypsy, Modern Greek, Polish,\r\nPortuguese, Rumanian, Slovak, Slovene, Serbo-Croatian, Old Greek, Spanish,\r\nTurkish and Italian. Owing to his manner of life and dress--he was not\r\nafraid to lead the life of a lowly proletarian--the people of Brno, in\r\nwhich city he lived and died, nicknamed him “Bohemian Diogenes.”\r\n\r\nDRAMA. That the Poles and the Bohemians, two submerged nations, have each\r\ngiven to the American stage a tragic actress--the Poles Helena Modjeska,\r\nthe Bohemians Frances Janauschek--may and may not be accidental. Many\r\npeople have supposed Janauschek to be a German tragedienne, because in the\r\nearly years of her career, before she mastered the English language, she\r\nplayed in German, on the German stage. But she was of pure Bohemian stock,\r\nborn in Prague in 1830. By virtue of her long residence in America and her\r\ndevotion to and life-long association with the American stage, she was\r\nreally an American actress.\r\n\r\nFICTION. Translations from fiction are disappointingly few. Of course,\r\nthis is no evidence that Bohemia has no fiction writers; the truth is that\r\nshe has not found Isabella Hapgoods and Jeremiah Curtins to translate\r\nwhat she has. With one notable exception, Božena Němcová’s _Babička_,\r\nnothing worth note has been rendered into English from the prose. The\r\nstory _Maria Felicia_ by Karolina Světlá, which an American Bohemian\r\nwoman has translated into English, is no more typical of Bohemia than it\r\nis of Finland, Spain or any other country. One should not only know how\r\nto translate, but, what is just as essential, what to translate. A. V.\r\nŠmilovský, whose story, _Nebesa_, the Moureks translated, is a meritorious\r\nwriter, but by no means of the high type of Alois Jirásek or Julius Zeyer.\r\n\r\nSeveral foreign writers of fiction have made use of a Bohemian theme\r\nmore or less successfully, the earliest of them being George Sand.\r\nUnfortunately Sand’s Bohemians in _Consuelo_ and in its sequel _The\r\nCountess of Rudolstadt_, are about as real as Robinson Crusoe’s Man\r\nFriday.\r\n\r\nFOLK AND FAIRY TALES. Karel Jaromír Erben (1811-1870), whose folk tales\r\nRev. Wratislaw translated into English, is recognized as an authority on\r\nfolk lore. “If Erben had left nothing else but his _Nosegay of National\r\nFolk Tales_, his name would always rank among Bohemian writers of the\r\nfirst magnitude,” says a critic. Most of the writers of folk tales here\r\nlisted have borrowed from Erben.\r\n\r\nTHE GUIDE TO THE KINGDOM OF BOHEMIA, published in Prague in 1906, is\r\nprimarily intended to attract travelers to the ancient capital of the\r\ncountry; however, the information it contains is of interest alike to\r\ntravelers and to non-travelers.\r\n\r\nHISTORY. Probably the first instance in which the English and the\r\nBohemians came into contact with each other, although as foes on the\r\nfield of battle, occurred in 1346 at the battle of Crécy. Here fell,\r\nfighting on the side of the French, against the English, John of Luxemburg,\r\nthe blind King of Bohemia. King John’s crest was three ostrich feathers\r\nand his motto “I serve”; which the Prince of Wales and his successors\r\nadopted in memorial of this great victory of the English.\r\n\r\nA more agreeable event in the relationship of England and Bohemia took\r\nplace thirty-six years later (1382), when Richard II. engaged himself to\r\nAnne of Luxemburg, the granddaughter of the very ruler whom the English\r\nhad fought at Crécy. The popular though erroneous belief is that through\r\nQueen Anne the writings of Wicliffe were introduced into Bohemia. In her\r\nreadable _Lives of the Queens of England_, Agnes Strickland devotes a few\r\nwarmly written pages to “Anne of Bohemia, surnamed the Good, first Queen\r\nof Richard II.”\r\n\r\nThe gallant knight, Sir Simon Burley, the English ambassador, was\r\ncharged with bringing Richard’s bride from Prague to London. “England\r\nwas to Bohemia a sort of terra incognita; and as a general knowledge of\r\ngeography and statistics was certainly not among the list of imperial\r\naccomplishments in the fourteenth century, the empress (Anne’s mother)\r\ndespatched duke Primislaus of Saxony on a voyage of discovery, to\r\nascertain, for the satisfaction of herself and the princess what sort\r\nof country England might be.”[2]\r\n\r\n  [2] Agnes Strickland: _Lives of the Queens of England_, v. 1, p. 592.\r\n\r\nEngland may have seemed an out of the way land to the Bohemians of old,\r\nyet the English people were by no means unknown to them. The fondness\r\nof the Bohemians for travel in foreign countries was well known.[3]\r\nThat entertaining compilation of wonder-stories comprised in _Sir John\r\nMandeville’s Travels_ was translated at an early date into the national\r\nlanguage. Students from Bohemia were wont to go to the universities at\r\nOxford and Paris in order to broaden their education. Jerome of Prague is\r\nknown to have studied at Oxford. Like others of his countrymen he had been\r\ndrawn thither by the fame of Wicliff’s name.\r\n\r\n  [3] See in History: Wratislaw’s _Adventures_; Šašek’s _Diary of an\r\n  Embassy_. The Embassy which Šašek describes was led by Leo z Rožmitálu\r\n  (Leo von Rosmital), a highly distinguished personage. The Embassy,\r\n  or mission, consisted of forty persons with fifty-two horses and a\r\n  Kamer-wagon and set out from Prague November 26, 1465. Šašek (Shassek)\r\n  relates how, when the mission reached London (p. 430) “crowds assembled\r\n  in the streets to stare at these Bohemian Samsons and Absolons.” In\r\n  London they remained for forty days, being feasted by the King and the\r\n  nobility. At Dunkirk they (the Bohemians) caught the first view of the\r\n  sea--Shakespeare’s description of Bohemia in the _Winter’s Tale_ as\r\n  “desert country near the sea” to the contrary notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nMost readers will be surprised to learn that a Bohemian had been one\r\nof the torchbearers of Reformation in Scotland. The name of this minor\r\nreformer is Paul of Kravař or Crawar, as Scotch writers spell the name.\r\nAccording to Burton[4] “Crawar was a German, believed to have come from\r\nBohemia to propose the doctrines that had been preached by John Hus and\r\nJerome of Prague. All that we are told of him personally is that he\r\nprofessed to be a physician, and to be traveling and visiting in the\r\npractice of his calling.” Kravař was burned at St. Andrews, July 23, 1433,\r\nas a heretic Hussite. “The churchman who records his burning,” relates\r\nBurton, “takes occasion to enlarge on the characteristics of Taborites\r\nand other Bohemian heretics.” Lang[5] states that “he was an envoy of the\r\nHussite ‘miscreants.’ Lawrence of Lindores attacked him, but he found him\r\nwell read in scriptures.”\r\n\r\n  [4] John Hill Burton: _The History of Scotland_, v. 3, p. 114. The lords\r\n  of Kravař were an ancient Bohemian family, who took a prominent part in\r\n  the affairs of their nation already in the thirteenth century. Certain\r\n  branches of the family were strong Hussite partisans.\r\n\r\n  [5] Andrew Lang: _History of Scotland, from the Roman Occupation_, v. 1,\r\n  pp. 310-11.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Hus\r\n\r\nPortrait by Hans Holbein]\r\n\r\nAt no time before or after have the English taken a more genuine interest\r\nin Bohemia and her affairs than during the events which followed the\r\noutbreak of the Thirty Years’ War. Their concern over what was happening\r\nin Bohemia at that time was due, mainly, to two reasons. The first was\r\nthat an Englishwoman, a daughter of the reigning family, had been elevated\r\nto the dignity of queen of that country. The second motive was a religious\r\none. Bohemia lay in the direct zone of the conflict raging between\r\nCatholicism and Protestantism and Protestant England could not but be\r\ngravely concerned over the fate of Protestant Bohemia. Money was collected\r\nand troops were raised to sustain the cause of the Stuart Queen in Prague\r\nand incidentally of Protestantism and it has been said that if James\r\nhad given his daughter the support which she and her husband expected\r\nfrom him, Bohemia’s position might have been wholly different today.\r\nBut “King James,” a historian tells us, “never stood greatly affected,\r\neither to this war, or to the cause thereof and thereupon some regiments\r\nof inexperienced volunteers going over, instead of a well composed army,\r\nit was one reason, among many others, that not only Bohemia, but the\r\nPalatinate were also lost....”\r\n\r\nElizabeth graced the Bohemian throne only for a few months between\r\n1619-1620, but she insisted upon bearing the title of Queen of Bohemia\r\nto the end of her days (1596-1662). Likewise her husband, Frederick,\r\n(1596-1632) “was resolved to foregoe not the title of the King of Bohemia\r\nthat he hath allreadie gotten.”\r\n\r\nAll Britain rejoiced when Elizabeth the “Pearl of the Stuarts” was wedded\r\nto Frederick of the Palatinate. John Taylor, the Water-Poet, wrote a\r\npoem about the “beloved Marriage of the two peerelesse Paragons of\r\nChristendome.” Historians have dutifully chronicled the event of “the\r\nmost blessed and happie marriage betweene the High and Mightie Prince\r\nFrederick the Fifth, Count Palatine of the Rhein, Duke of Bavier, etc. And\r\nthe most Vertvous, Gracious and thrice excellent Princesse, Elizabeth,\r\nSole Daughter to our dread Soueraigne, James by the grace of God, King of\r\nGreat Britaine, France and Ireland, etc., celebrated at White-Hall the\r\nfourteenth of Februarie, 1612.”\r\n\r\nIn 1619, the Bohemian Protestant Estates deposed their King and offered\r\nthe crown to Frederick, in the hope that the “King of England would,\r\nout of his three kingdoms, send such a continued stock of men to the\r\nPalatinate, that the crown of Bohemia should be established on the head\r\nof the Elector Palatinate and that by no course sooner than by virtue\r\nof the English arms.”\r\n\r\nWe read of the “Departure of the high and mightie Prince Frederick King\r\nElect of Bohemia: With his royall and vertuous Ladie Elizabeth: And the\r\nthryse hopefull yong Prince Henrie, from Heydelberg towards Prague, to\r\nreceive the Crowne of that Kingdome. Whereunto is annexed the Solempnitie\r\nor maner of the Coronation.”\r\n\r\nOn another page the reader will find a quaint account of the coronation\r\nceremonies in Prague written by an eyewitness, presumably John Harrison.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th day of November, 1620, near Prague, on the slopes of the White\r\nHill (Bílá Hora), was fought a fateful battle between the Imperialists\r\n(Austrians) and the Bohemian Army.\r\n\r\nReferring to this catastrophal battle, which cost Bohemia her independence,\r\nSir Charles Montagu, English Ambassador stationed at Vienna wrote to his\r\nkinsman, Sir Edward Montagu: “To begin with the worst first, there is news\r\ncome now of more certain truth than heretofore from Bohemya, which is that\r\nthe King’s army hath had a great overthrow, and Prage is lost, but the\r\nKing and Queen are at a strong place called Presslaw in Selecya, and the\r\nKing of Hungary and he have met and they both intend to raise a far greater\r\nforce to set on them (the Imperialists) suddenly; God give them better\r\nsuccess.”\r\n\r\nThe King of Bohemia, as subsequent events proved, did not meet with better\r\nsuccess. In a day or two after that fatal 8th day of November, when\r\nBohemia was going to her destruction, he left Prague precipitately with\r\nhis queen, never to return to that capital....\r\n\r\nBohemian historians speak in terms of warm praise of Elizabeth, the\r\n“Winter Queen,” but their estimate of Frederick, “First Prince of the\r\nImperiall bloud, sprung from glorious Charlemaigne,” falls lamentably\r\nshort of the measure taken of him by the Bohemian Estates, as reprinted\r\non another page.\r\n\r\nConceivably for the “Winter Queen’s” enlightenment, John Harrison, who\r\naccompanied the royal pair to Prague in the capacity of court chaplain,\r\nsketched the “Historie of Bohemia, the first parte describing the\r\nCountrye, Scituation, Climate, Commodities, the Name and Nature of the\r\nPeople and compendiously continuing the Historie from the beginning of\r\nthe Nation to the First Christian Prince, about the year of Christ 990.”\r\n\r\nSpeaking “in the name of all our exiled nation” the Bohemian Church\r\nappealed for help “to the lord protector, his highness council, and the\r\nparliament.”[6]\r\n\r\n  [6] John Thurloe: _Collection of State Papers_, v. 2, p. 441.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the Waldenses, Protector Cromwell ordered a national\r\nsubscription; and a handsome amount was collected during the spring of\r\n1658 to relieve the distress of Bohemian Protestants. Komenský and his\r\nfellow exiles were invited to settle in Ireland, the Protector desiring to\r\nstrengthen the Protestant element there. The “Act for the Satisfaction of\r\nAdventurers and Soldiers” authorized “all persons of what nation soever\r\nprofessing the Protestant religion to rent or purchase forfeited lands,”\r\nbut the Dutch, German and Bohemian emigrants whom this clause contemplated\r\nnever came.[7] Believing in the fulfillment of Drabík’s false prophecy,\r\nthat the cause of Protestantism in Bohemia would prevail in the end and\r\nthat the exiles would yet return home in triumph, Komenský hesitated to\r\naccept England’s proffer.\r\n\r\n  [7] Charles Harding Firth: _The Last Years of the Protectorate,\r\n  1656-1658_. Also Vaughn: _Protectorate of Cromwell_, v. II, p. 447.\r\n\r\nProtestant refugees, who had been driven from home by Ferdinand’s edicts,\r\nwandered to England in pursuit of religious freedom and livelihood.\r\nSimon Partlicius (1593-1639), preacher and author and Samuel Martinius\r\n(1588-1640), writer and mathematician, both enjoyed England’s hospitality\r\nfor a time. So did Komenský who came in 1642 to London to visit friends\r\nand to further his literary projects. Wenceslaus Hollar established a\r\npermanent residence in England. Letters are extant written by Komenský’s\r\nson-in-law, Peter Figulus, and dated at Oxford. At least two exiles,\r\nWenceslaus Libanus and Paul Hartmann, both members of the Brethren’s\r\nUnity, had been ordained as ministers of the Church of England.\r\n\r\nThat the Irish Franciscans had been invited to Bohemia during the Thirty\r\nYears’ War to assist in the re-Catholisation of the country, is known.\r\nIn Hybernská ulice, a famous thoroughfare in Prague, named after them,\r\nthe Irish Friars founded a monastery in 1630. Later (1659) they built\r\nthere the Church of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception. Although the\r\nmonastery has long passed out of existence and even the church edifice\r\nhas been forced to give way to business, the name, Hybernská ulice, still\r\nreminds the tourist of the presence of the Hibernians in Prague. An Irish\r\nname--that of Count Edward Francis Josef Taafe--has figured largely in\r\nAustrian and Bohemian politics of yesterday. The Taafes secured an\r\nincholate in Moravia in the middle of the eighteenth century and have\r\nintermarried with the Šlik, Chotek and Pachta families.\r\n\r\nNo narrative of the Thirty Years’ War is complete or understandable\r\nunless the student knows what part Bohemia took in the great struggle.\r\nA recognized authority on the subject is Anton Gindely, (1829-1892)\r\nProfessor at the Prague University. Gindely’s _Geschichte des\r\ndreissigjährigen Krieges_ has been translated by A. Ten Brook.\r\n\r\nA quarter of a century ago one could not find on the shelves of an\r\nAmerican library a comprehensive history of the Bohemian nation written\r\nin English. The task and the distinction of writing such a work fell to\r\nthe lot of a Chicago lawyer of Scotch-Irish ancestry, Robert H. Vickers.\r\nVicker’s _History of Bohemia_ was published in 1894 in Chicago, the\r\nmunificence of the Bohemian National Committee making the publication\r\npossible. Stranger to the subtle modern forces of the nation’s life,\r\nunfamiliar with its language, unduly in love with the rust of the past,\r\nVickers produced a volume suffering obviously from bookiness. The Chicago\r\nBohemians erected a monument in the National Cemetery to the memory of\r\ntheir Scotch-Irish friend.\r\n\r\nA year later (1895), there appeared another history of the nation: Frances\r\nGregor’s _Story of Bohemia_.\r\n\r\nIn translating into idiomatic English the little classic, Němcová’s\r\n_Babička_--the first story book by a Bohemian author to be so\r\nhonored--Frances Gregor rendered an actual service to literature. Many\r\nan American Bohemian youth has had his or her first glimpse of the charms\r\nof Bohemian country life from _Babička_, but her _Story of Bohemia_ has\r\nsince been supplanted by newer and abler historical studies. Frances\r\nGregor’s talents lay not in historical research but in light fiction\r\nwriting and literary criticism. An incurable malady greatly interfered\r\nwith intensive literary labor, making her life all but unendurable. She\r\ndied in Colorado in 1901, aged fifty-one years.\r\n\r\nTwo additional histories were put on the market by publishers in 1896:\r\n_Bohemia: an Historical Sketch_, by Count Lützow; and Charles Edmund\r\nMaurice’s _Bohemia: from the earliest times to the fall of national\r\nindependence in 1620_.\r\n\r\nIt is no secret that English Bohemica cost Count Lützow (born 1849 in\r\nHamburg, died 1916 in Switzerland) his diplomatic career, making him\r\n_persona non grata_ at the Vienna court. Of the several volumes written\r\nby this high-minded, unselfish nobleman, the most erudite and mature is\r\n_The Hussite Wars_. Lützow is especially esteemed by English-speaking\r\nBohemians, for they alone are able to appreciate the measure of his labors.\r\n\r\nWill S. Monroe’s _Bohemia and the Čechs_ was published in 1910. It\r\nis profusely illustrated and contains an informative review of the\r\nliterature, art, politics and the economic and social conditions of the\r\npeople. Monroe knows his Bohemia from close personal association and\r\nnot from books alone, and his _Bohemia and the Čechs_ has achieved wider\r\npopularity than any of the accounts preceding it.\r\n\r\nIn the _Cambridge Modern History_ the student will find abundant and\r\nreliable material on Bohemia, from such noted writers as Robert Nisbet\r\nBain, A. W. Ward, Louis Eisenmann, and others.\r\n\r\nJOHN HUS. JEROME OF PRAGUE. UNITY. MORAVIANS. The Hussite Reformation\r\nin the fifteenth century was a movement which concerned not Bohemia\r\nalone, but the entire Christian world. “Thus begun,” remarks Bishop de\r\nSchweinitz, “one of the most remarkable and at the same time terrific\r\nwars the world has seen; for sixteen years Bohemia single handed defied\r\npapal Europe.” Two Englishmen, John Wickliffe and Peter Payne, the first\r\nimpersonally, through his writings, the other personally, played not an\r\ninconspicuous rôle in the great religious awakening which followed the\r\nburning of Hus at the stake in 1415.\r\n\r\nThe Hussite literature, as the reader will perceive, is quite bulky. Of\r\nthe non-Bohemian Hus scholars, whose works have been written in English or\r\ntranslated into that tongue, these deserve to be mentioned: De Bonnechose,\r\n_Les Réformateurs avant la Réforme_, known as _Reformers before the\r\nReformation_; Johann Loserth’s _Hus und Wiclif_; De Schweinitz’s _History\r\nof the Church known as the Unitas Fratrum, or the Unity of the Brethren_;\r\nCount Lützow’s _The Hussite Wars_; David S. Schaff’s _John Huss; His\r\nLife, Teachings and Death_; W. N. Schwarze’s _John Hus, the Martyr of\r\nBohemia_. Knowing the Bohemian language and being in a position to make\r\nuse of native sources, some of them still unpublished, Count Lützow has\r\nhad an undoubted advantage over Hus commentators who were not so fitted.\r\nRev. E. H. Gillett’s _Life and Times of John Huss_, was, after it had been\r\npublished, adversely commented upon, the author being openly charged with\r\ntaking bodily sentences, paragraphs and pages from De Bonnechose, without\r\ngiving the Frenchman due credit. (See _North American Review_, July,\r\n1865.) Rev. A. H. Wratislaw’s _John Huss, the commencement of resistance\r\nto papal authority_, has for its basis the trustworthy researches of the\r\nhistorians Palacký and Tomek.\r\n\r\nThe Moravian Church, claiming direct descent from the Unity of Bohemian\r\nBrethren, has produced noteworthy sectarian literature. In fact, the\r\nMoravians, to mention only one scholar, the late Bishop de Schweinitz,\r\nhave done more than any other evangelical church in the way of\r\ninterpreting to the English speaking people the most stirring chapters\r\nof Bohemian history.\r\n\r\nThere is this criticism to be made, however, in reference to the Hus\r\nliterature, that while non-Bohemian writers regard Hus as a religious\r\nreformer only and treat the reformation inaugurated by him wholly in the\r\nlight of a religious upheaval, the Bohemians insist on taking a broader\r\nview of Hus and of Hussites. To them Hus reveals himself not only as\r\na religious reformer, but likewise as a champion and purifier of the\r\nnative tongue. In the Hussite Wars they recognize a political-spiritual\r\nrevolution, having for its purpose the liberation of the Bohemian nation\r\nalike from papal trammels and from German domination.\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian Church, Unity, Unitas Fratrum, Unity of Bohemian Brethren,\r\nBrethren’s Unity, are the names given to a church which originated in the\r\nsecond half of the fifteenth century. In the severely strict notions as\r\nto what is proper in the practice of religious duties, the Unity bore a\r\nstriking resemblance to the Puritans.\r\n\r\nIts doctrine and discipline are admirably set forth in the articles\r\npassed in 1616 at the Synod of Žeravice. These articles, provided with\r\nannotations by Komenský have been translated into English, under the\r\ntitle _Ratio disciplinae, or the Constitution of the Congregational\r\nChurches_. Thus one is able to trace the influence of the Unity upon the\r\nChurch of England. When the Bohemian Revolution broke out (1618) the\r\nnobility belonging to the Unity were powerful enough to influence the\r\nselection of a new King in the place of Ferdinand II., who was dethroned\r\nby the Estates. The choice, as we know, fell upon Frederick of the\r\nPalatinate. The Patent of Tolerance, (1781) allowing Protestant worship\r\nin Austria, purposely excluded the Unity. To the Government the church\r\nwas objectionable, first because of its Bohemian national traditions,\r\nand secondly because of the leading part its members had taken in the\r\nrevolution against Ferdinand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Protest\r\n\r\nDated Sept. 2, 1415, by 100 Bohemian Lords against the burning of John\r\nHus. Since 1657 property of the University of Edinburgh]\r\n\r\nSome of the greatest writers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\r\nwere members of the Unity: John Augusta (1500-1572, Bishop and writer),\r\nJohn Blahoslav (1523-1571), collaborator on the _Kralice Bible_, author\r\nof _Grammatika Česká_, Charles, Lord of Žerotín (1564-1636), John Amos\r\nKomenský. The Unity reformed schools and promoted literature by setting up\r\nprinting shops in Bohemia and Moravia. Toward the close of the fifteenth\r\ncentury a printing shop was opened in Mladá Boleslav; in the first part of\r\nthe sixteenth century another was established at Bělá, near Bezděz, and\r\nstill another at Litomyšl. The last named town was, up to 1547, looked\r\nupon as the chief seat of the administration of the church. Because of\r\npersecution, the Unity transferred its centre to Přerov in Moravia. Here\r\ntoo, it set up printing establishments, the one at Ivančice becoming\r\nin time far-famed. In 1578 the Ivančice concern was moved to Kralice\r\n(Moravia).\r\n\r\nBy common consent, the _Kralice Bible_, so called from Kralice, where it\r\nwas printed, is regarded as the most enduring literary work of the Unity.\r\nFor fourteen years eight eminent scholars worked on this Bible, rendering\r\nthe translation into a language idiomatic, and pure beyond that of any\r\nother book. It was published between the years 1579-93, and Lord Žerotín\r\nbore the expense of it. The British Bible Society in publishing a Bohemian\r\nBible followed exactly the edition of 1613.\r\n\r\nThe New York Lenox Library, which is now a part of the New York Public\r\nLibrary, owns: 1. A complete set of the _Kralice Bible_; the sixth volume,\r\nhowever, is of a later edition. 2. Two copies of the _Prague Bible_. 3.\r\nOne copy of the _Paul Severín of Kapí Hora Bible_ of the edition of 1537.\r\nThe _Kralice Bible_ was bought by Lenox, the founder of the Lenox Library,\r\nfrom the collection of the Duke of Sussex.[8]\r\n\r\n  [8] See article _Moravští Bratři v Americe_ by Thomas Čapek, _Osvěta_,\r\n  Prague. 19:565-72. 1889.\r\n\r\nJOHN AMOS KOMENSKÝ. John Amos Komenský (or Comenius, which is the\r\nLatinized form of the name), one of the great figures in Bohemian history,\r\nwas born in 1592 in Moravia, (hence the suffix “Moravus” seen on some of\r\nhis works) and died as an exile in 1670 in Holland.\r\n\r\nThough he was a churchman of prominence, being the last Bishop of\r\nthe Unity, his reputation is founded not on his ecclesiastical and\r\nphilosophical writings, but on his pedagogical studies. As a school\r\nreformer he was the first to carry out the principle, long since\r\nrecognized as sound by all teachers, of appealing to the senses; so he\r\ncalled the artist to his aid. The result was the _Orbis Sensualium Pictus_\r\nor the _Visible World_. “The circumstances of his life were as unfavorable\r\nas possible to his career as a writer,” remarks Lützow. “Traveling\r\nfrom Moravia to Bohemia, thence to Poland, Germany, England, Sweden,\r\nHungary, Holland, ever unable to obtain tranquillity, often in financial\r\ndifficulties, twice deprived of his library by fire, forced to write\r\nschool-books, when he was planning metaphysical works that he believed\r\nto be of the greatest value, he always undauntedly continued his vast\r\nliterary undertakings.”\r\n\r\nFrom Cotton Mather[9] we learn (a fact which is confirmed by other\r\nsources) that Governor Winthrop offered to Komenský the Presidency of\r\nHarvard College. “That brave old man Johannes Amos Comenius, the fame\r\nof whose worth hath been Trumpetted as far as more than Three Languages\r\n(Whereof everyone is endebted unto his Janua) could carry it, was agreed\r\nwithal by our Mr. Winthrop, in his travels through the Low Countries, to\r\ncome over into New England and Illuminate this Colledge and Country in the\r\nQuality of President: But the Solicitations of the Swedish ambassador,\r\ndiverting him another way, that Incomparable Moravian became not an\r\nAmerican.”\r\n\r\n  [9] _Magnalia Christi Americana_; or, _The Ecclesiastical History of New\r\n  England_. Book IX., p. 128.\r\n\r\nBiographers are not agreed as to the number of Komenský’s works. F. J.\r\nZoubek has enumerated 137 of them; Keatinge lists 127. Some were written\r\nin Latin, others in Bohemian, though Komenský, having received his\r\ntheological training in Germany, was conversant with the language of that\r\ncountry also.\r\n\r\nAs a master of Bohemian diction he had few, if any, peers. To the\r\nrevivalists Komenský’s writings were a safe and never-failing storehouse\r\nof philologic material and even today, despite the circumstance that\r\nBohemian syntax and orthography like the English, have undergone an\r\nessential change, his style is a source of delight to literary purists.\r\n\r\nHis chief writings that have been translated into English, and the main\r\nfacts of their publication, are as follows:\r\n\r\n_The Gate of Tongues Unlocked_ first appeared in Latin in Leszno (Lissa),\r\nPoland, in 1631; the same year in German. The Bohemian edition is dated\r\n1633, the English 1633.\r\n\r\n_The School of Infancy._ This manual was written primarily for the use of\r\nBohemian schools, but when the author realized that he could not return to\r\nhis fatherland, being a Protestant, the work was translated into German.\r\nThe English edition is dated 1641. The Bohemian manuscript was discovered\r\nonly in 1856 and put into print two years later.\r\n\r\n_A Reformation of Schooles_ was printed for Michael Sparke, London, 1642.\r\n\r\n_The History of the Bohemian Persecution_, which is one of the author’s\r\nchurch works, was completed in Bohemian in 1632, but was not published\r\nin that tongue until 1655. The date of the Latin version is 1647; of the\r\nEnglish, 1650.\r\n\r\nJeremy Collier’s rendering into English of the _Pansophiae_, or, as the\r\ntranslator entitled it, _Patterne of Universall Knowledge_, is dated,\r\nLondon, 1651. Published in 1643, in Danzig, it was printed two years later\r\nin Amsterdam. The Bohemian translation is quite recent, dating from 1879.\r\n“No one can impartially claim for Komenský a high rank as a philosopher,”\r\ncomments Count Lützow, “and it is certainly a mistake to speak of\r\nKomenský’s system of philosophy. There is no philosophical system of\r\nKomenský in the sense that there exists a philosophical system of Spinoza.”\r\n\r\n_The Physicae_ or _Naturall Philosophie Reformed by Divine Light_ was\r\nprinted in Leipsic in 1633, in Amsterdam 1643, 1645, 1663, etc. The\r\nBohemian translation is recent. The English edition, in this catalogue,\r\nis of 1651.\r\n\r\n_The True and Readie Way to Learne the Latine Tongue_ appeared in Leszno,\r\n1633. It was translated later into Dutch, English (our catalogue’s London\r\nedition is of 1654), Magyar, Swedish and Polish. The Latin-Bohemian-German\r\nedition is dated Trenčín, Hungary, 1649.\r\n\r\nKomenský’s most popular book, the _Orbis Sensualium Pictus_, was printed\r\noriginally in Nuremberg, in 1658. The English translation by Charles Hoole\r\nfollowed one year later. The Latin-German-Magyar-Bohemian edition was\r\nissued in 1685; the first American edition, a reprint from Hoole’s twelfth\r\nLondon edition, in New York, in 1810.\r\n\r\nThat the English translation of _The Great Didactic_, which Komenský wrote\r\nbetween 1627-1632 in the Bohemian language and in 1640 in Latin (published\r\nin Amsterdam, 1657), was not undertaken until our time (1896) is a matter\r\nof great surprise. The same comment is pertinent to Komenský’s most\r\nreadable little volume, _The Labyrinth of the World and the Paradise of\r\nthe Heart_, which strikingly reminds one of Bunyan’s _Pilgrim’s Progress_.\r\nIt was only in 1905 that it found an able translator in the person of\r\nCount Lützow. _The Praxis Pietatis_, an oft-quoted book which passed\r\nthrough several editions in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries has\r\nnot been translated for the very good reason that it, in itself, was an\r\nadaptation, from the _Practice of Piety_, a volume by an English divine.\r\n\r\n_The Exhortation of the Churches of Bohemia to the Church of England_,\r\nEnglished by Joshua Tymarchus and printed for Thomas Parkhurst, in\r\nCheapside, 1661, was used eighty-seven years later as an argument and a\r\nplea by a distinguished English American, Gen. Oglethorpe.\r\n\r\nAddressing the English Parliament (1748) in favor of the passage of a\r\nbill to relieve the United Brethren, or Moravians, from military duty and\r\noaths, General Oglethorpe explained that the “Brethren were received\r\nin England under King Edward the Sixth, and countenanced under his\r\nsuccessors.... And to speak a few words of their further intercourse with\r\nthe Church of England. Their Bishop, Comenius, presented the history of\r\nhis church to King Charles the Second, in the year 1660, with a moving\r\naccount of their sufferings, addressed to the Church of England.... In\r\nthe year 1683, a most pathetic account of these Brethren was published by\r\norder of Archbishop Sancroft and Bishop Compton. They also addressed the\r\nChurch of England, in the year 1715, being reduced to a very low ebb in\r\nPoland; and his late Majesty, George I., by the recommendation of the late\r\nArchbishop Wake, gave orders in Council for the relief of these reformed\r\nepiscopal churches, and Letters Patent for their support were issued soon\r\nafter.”\r\n\r\nThe prognostications made in _Revelation Revealed by two Apocalyptical\r\nTreatises_, is a book which relates to prophecies and alleged visions by\r\nChristopher Kotter, Christina Poniatovia and an unscrupulous impostor,\r\nNichols Drabík by name. Genuinely believing in the truth of the prophecies\r\nof this trio, Komenský was ridiculed and criticized by contemporaries,\r\nespecially by the Frenchman, Pierre Bayle (1647-1706) in his _Dictionnaire\r\nHistorique et Critique_. Hallam’s belittling appraisal of the author of\r\n_Orbis Sensualium Pictus_ (“this author, a man of much industry, some\r\ningenuity, and a little judgment, made himself a temporary reputation by\r\nhis _Orbis Sensualium Pictus_, etc.”) is no doubt traceable to Bayle’s\r\nunfavorable estimate. Bayle’s writings, be it remarked, were held in high\r\nregard by men of letters of his time.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 educators the world over observed the three hundredth anniversary\r\nof Komenský’s birth. The March (1892) number of the _Educational Review_\r\nwas wholly devoted to him; it contained articles by the editor, Nicholas\r\nMurray Butler (now President of Columbia University), S. S. Laurie, C. W.\r\nBardeen, Paul H. Hanus. The American Bohemians in several cities, Chicago,\r\nNew York, Omaha, Milwaukee and Cleveland, by appropriate ceremonies\r\nalso celebrated the anniversary of the birth of their distinguished\r\nfellow-countryman.\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE AND LITERATURE. _The Cheskian Anthology_ (1832) compiled by\r\nSir John Bowring (1792-1872) is the earliest known effort to acquaint\r\nthe English reading public with Bohemian literature which was just then\r\nbeginning to revive from the débâcle of the Thirty Years’ War. Before\r\nthis, Bowring had written a sympathetic review for the _Foreign Quarterly\r\nReview_ (1828) of Joseph Jungmann’s _Historie literatury české_. For the\r\n_Westminster Review_ (1830) he wrote a resumé of the _Manuscript of the\r\nQueen’s Court_ (Rukopis Kralodvorský) since pronounced by philologists,\r\nlike Macpherson’s Songs of Ossian, spurious.\r\n\r\nAnother Englishman who formed a deep attachment for the youthful Bohemian\r\nrepublic of letters was the Rev. Albert Henry Wratislaw (1821-1889). By\r\nhis several translations and original studies Wratislaw rendered valuable\r\nservice in England to the nation from which his ancestors had sprung.\r\nWratislaw claimed descent from the ancient and honorable family of the\r\nWratislaws of Mitrovic. Conceivably the relationship with the Wratislaws\r\nof Bohemia prompted him to translate into English _The Adventures of Baron\r\nWenceslas Wratislaw of Mitrowitz_. Wratislaw’s _Bohemian Poems, Ancient\r\nand Modern_, from the original Slavonic (Bohemian) is a skillful piece of\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nWriting under the pen name Talvj, Mrs. Robinson, wife of the Rev.\r\nRobinson, has devoted a chapter in her _Historical View of the Languages\r\nand Literatures of the Slavonic Nations_ to the _History of the Czekhish\r\nor Bohemian Languages and Literature_. Mrs. Robinson’s views on Bohemian\r\nliterature are by no means her own. Palacký and Šafařík have pointed\r\nout that the chapter is nothing but an extract from Paul J. Šafařík’s\r\n_Geschichte der slavischen Sprache und Literatur nach allen Mundarten_.\r\nThe pseudonym Talvj, by the way, she conceived by putting together the\r\ninitial letters of her maiden name, T. A. L. v. J., that is, Theresa\r\nAlbertina Louisa von Jacobi.\r\n\r\nFlora P. Kopta’s _Bohemian Legends and Other Poems_ is not a satisfying\r\nwork. Far more felicitous than her poetry is her prose volume, _The\r\nForestman of Vimpek_.\r\n\r\nThe credit for worthily introducing Bohemian poetry belongs to an\r\nEnglishman, P. Selver. _The Anthology of Modern Bohemian Poetry_ is an\r\nadmirable achievement. Not only is Selver’s interpretation faithful, but\r\nthe selection of authors is representative.\r\n\r\nLeo Wiener, a well-known Slavic scholar connected with Harvard University,\r\nhas presented to the public a fine rendition of J. S. Machar’s _Magdalen_.\r\n\r\nRichard William Morfill (1835-1909), late Slavic Professor at Oxford,\r\nhas written voluminously on Slavic history and philology. Among his\r\nphilological studies are: a simplified grammar of the Polish language, a\r\ngrammar of the Russian language, a grammar of the Bulgarian language, _A\r\nGrammar of the Bohemian or Čech language_. The last named is the only work\r\nof its kind in English, Charles Jonáš’ _Bohemian Made Easy_ being really\r\nan interpreter and not a scientific grammar. The Bohemian Literary Society\r\nof Chicago, it is reported, has in preparation a new English grammar for\r\nthe study of the Čech language.\r\n\r\nIn Count Lützow’s _History of Bohemian Literature_, the student will find\r\nan excellent manual. With his usual painstaking care, the author recounts\r\nin a lucid manner the story of Bohemian literature, its glory and its\r\nvicissitudes.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANY. Attention is called to a meritorious volume under this\r\nsubtitle, by de Moleville, _The Costumes of the Hereditary (!) States of\r\nthe House of Austria_. Fifteen plates portray old Bohemian, Slovak and\r\nMoravian costumes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Kralice Bible\r\n\r\nThough not the oldest in point of date, the Kralice Bible (1st ed.\r\n  1579-93, 6 vs.) is the most renowned of all the Bohemian Bibles. Formerly\r\n  in the Lenox collection, it is now the property, with other rare Bohemian\r\n  Bibles, of the New York City Public Library]\r\n\r\nMUSIC. Critics rate Bedřich Smetana (1824-1884) as the greatest Bohemian\r\ncomposer, yet it is Dr. Antonín Dvořák (1841-1904) who is the most widely\r\nknown outside of his native country. The reason for this is that Dvořák\r\nvisited England and spent a number of years in New York as director of a\r\nconservatory of music. “The forcefulness and freshness of Dvořák’s music,”\r\nwrites H. E. Krehbiel, the noted New York musical critic, “come primarily\r\nfrom his use of dialects and idioms derived from the folk-music of the\r\nChekhs.... Dvořák is not a nationalist in the Lisztian sense; he borrows\r\nnot melodies but the characteristic elements from the folk-songs of his\r\npeople.”\r\n\r\nSmetana’s renown was won on precisely the same ground which made Dvořák\r\nfamous, the only difference being that Smetana applied the principle of\r\nthe folk-song before Dvořák. Previous to Smetana’s time one could speak of\r\nmusic in Bohemia, but not of Bohemian music. George Benda (1721-1795),\r\nJoseph Mysliveček (1737-1781), John Ladislav Dusík (1761-1812--the name\r\nof this “neglected composer” is also spelled Dussek), Václav John Tomášek\r\nor Tomaschek (1774-1850), author of the usual method of fingering double\r\nscales, were writers of music who belonged to the period when there was\r\nmusic in Bohemia, when composers were content to imitate Beethoven, Bach,\r\nMozart and Wagner; when they strove to out-German the Germans in music.\r\nSmetana was the first to strike the true chord of inspiration--the chord\r\ntouching the nation’s soul--the folk-song. It was the influence of the\r\nfolk-song which lent to his masterpiece, the _Bartered Bride_, (Prodaná\r\nNevěsta) its exquisite charm and enduring freshness. Apropos, the Bartered\r\nBride was introduced to the American public at the New York Metropolitan\r\nOpera House on April 29, 1909, and the baton on this unforgettable\r\noccasion was wielded by Gustav Mahler, also a native of Bohemia, though\r\nnot a Čech.\r\n\r\nOf the several musical artists who have visited the United States, none\r\nhave won larger recognition from the critics and the public than Jan\r\nKubelík (born 1880), violinist, Emmy Destinn (born 1878), soprano.\r\n\r\nPERIODICALS. The long cherished wish that there might be an English\r\nlanguage newspaper which should interpret to the Americans the ideals of\r\nthe Bohemian race was realized in September, 1892, when _The Bohemian\r\nVoice_, a monthly printed in Omaha and published by the National\r\nCommittee, was issued. Through lack of funds _The Bohemian Voice_ was\r\nforced to suspend publication in November, 1894. The first editor of this\r\n“organ of the Bohemian-Americans in the United States” was Thomas Čapek;\r\nupon his resignation, in April, 1894, J. J. Král took charge as editor.\r\n\r\nThe speculative _American Bi-Monthly_, launched in Chicago in 1914, failed\r\nafter publishing two numbers.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1917, the Bohemian National Alliance in America started a\r\nmonthly in Chicago, _The Bohemian Review_. In the initial number the\r\neditor, Dr. J. F. Smetanka, argues as follows: “If some two hundred\r\nthousand people[10] can support more than eighty publications in the\r\nBohemian language, why should not three hundred thousand of their\r\nchildren, more used to the English language, establish and support just\r\none organ devoted to their interests as Americans of Czech descent?”\r\n\r\n  [10] The 1910 U. S. census has found in the country 539,392 people of\r\n  Bohemian stock, of whom 228,738 were foreign born, 310,654 native born.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it may be added, that _The New Europe_, of London, though\r\nby no means a Bohemian or a Slavic magazine, has paid generous attention\r\nto Bohemian questions as affected by the war. Among the collaborators of\r\n_The New Europe_ are such able students of Austrian politics as Thomas G.\r\nMasaryk, late Professor at the Bohemian University of Prague, Dr. R. W.\r\nSeton-Watson of King’s College and H. Wickham Steed of the London _Times_.\r\n\r\nPLANS, MAPS. ETC. Of especial interest to the students of American\r\nColonial history is the _Map of Virginia and Maryland this present\r\nYear 1670 Surveyed and Exactly Drawne by the Only Labour and Endeavour\r\nof Augustin Herrman, Bohemiensis_. A copy of this rare map is on file\r\nin the Library of Congress in Washington.[11] In addition to the Map of\r\nMaryland, Herrman made a sketch of New Amsterdam (New York) as that city\r\nlooked in 1650. Herrman is reputed to be the first Bohemian immigrant to\r\nAmerica, coming here in 1633. On the site of the former Bohemia Manor\r\nin Cecil County, Maryland, there is still preserved a tombstone bearing\r\nthis inscription: “Avgvstine Herrmen Bohemian The First Fovnder Seater of\r\nBohemea Manner Anno 1661.” Like Wenceslaus Hollar, John Amos Komenský,\r\nPaul Skála ze Zhoře, (the historian) and thousands of other Protestants,\r\nHerrman, the son of a minister of the gospel, was forced to flee from\r\nBohemia after the overthrow of the Protestants there.\r\n\r\n  [11] For Augustine Herrman’s life see _Památky Českých Emigrantů v\r\n  Americe_ (Data on Bohemian Immigration to America), by Thomas Čapek,\r\n  Omaha, 1907. J. V. Nigrin described Herrman’s map in the Chicago\r\n  _Svornost_, August 2-9, 1914.\r\n\r\nPOLITICS AND WAR PUBLICATIONS. Publication has received an unwonted\r\nimpetus from the war. Never since the Thirty Years’ War have the\r\ngrievances and political aspirations of the Bohemians been given more\r\nwidespread publicity. Woodrow Wilson stated the situation precisely in one\r\nof his books when he declared that “no lapse of time, no defeat of hopes,\r\nseems sufficient to reconcile the Czechs of Bohemia to incorporation with\r\nAustria.” Since 1848, the year which saw the dawn of constitutionalism\r\nin the Hapsburg monarchy, the Bohemians have been asking for home rule;\r\nthe lessons of war at once suggested a bolder program, a new orientation.\r\nPresently their leaders demand a separation from Austria and the inclusion\r\nin an independent Bohemian State of the Slovaks of Hungary. Under this\r\nsubtitle the reader will find indexed articles by opponents (Heilprin)\r\nas well as by well-wishers. Of the new orientation, that is, of a\r\nBohemian-Slovak State, free and independent, the leading intellect outside\r\nof Bohemia is Professor Masaryk, temporarily an exile in England.\r\n\r\nThomas Garrigue Masaryk (the middle name is assumed from that of his\r\nAmerican wife, Miss Charlotte Garrigue of New York) is writing his name\r\nlarge in what posterity will joyfully call Bohemian Emancipation. Masaryk\r\nwas born of humble Moravian-Slovak parentage in 1850. From the time he\r\nentered public life, he was always a rebel, though in the finest sense of\r\nthe term; rebel in politics, rebel in literature, rebel in the manner he\r\ninterpreted Bohemian nationalism. That he was not summarily removed from\r\nthe chair he occupied in the Prague University was due to fear of the man,\r\nto fear of his large following, and not to the want of powerful accusers\r\nor because of scruples on the part of the government. In native literature\r\nand politics alike, Masaryk’s activities are bound to leave a deep mark.\r\nFortunately for the cause, he was able to effect his escape from Austria\r\nin the early stages of the war.\r\n\r\nAn able writer and a forceful advocate of Bohemia’s cause in the United\r\nStates is Charles Pergler, vice-president of the Bohemian National\r\nAlliance in America.\r\n\r\nPRAGUE. Von Humboldt was not the only traveler who thought that the\r\ncapital of the Bohemian Kingdom was the most beautiful inland town of all\r\nEurope. American and English tourists who have visited the city all concur\r\nin the opinion of von Humboldt. “Prague to a Bohemian,” to quote Arthur\r\nSymons (_Harper’s Magazine_, Sept., 1901), “is the epitome of the history\r\nof his country; he sees it as the man sees the woman he loves, with her\r\nfirst beauty.” Lützow’s _Story of Prague_ will fully repay the reader who\r\nwould like to know more of this beautiful mediæval city.\r\n\r\nSOCIOLOGY AND ECONOMICS. The theme of Slavic immigration to America within\r\nthe last twenty-five years has been considered by politicians, settlement\r\nworkers, immigration “specialists,” professional labor agitators and\r\nothers. The caption of Alois B. Koukol’s article in _The Charities and\r\nCommons, A Slav’s a Man for A’ That_, sums up the situation precisely.\r\nYes, the American Slav is a man, for all that has been said about\r\nhim--chiefly against him--by professional labor agitators; but it took the\r\nGreat War to demonstrate his utility to America. No economist has written\r\nof him with greater sympathy, understanding and tact than Emily Greene\r\nBalch, teacher at Wellesley College. To get a more accurate perspective on\r\nthe subject, Miss Balch went to the source, to their homelands to observe\r\n_Our Slavic Fellow Citizens_.\r\n\r\nSOKOLS. The “Sokol Union” (Sokol in Bohemian means falcon, a bird typical\r\nof strength and fearlessness) is, or rather was, until the Great War,\r\nthe most powerful non-political organization in Bohemia. Suspecting its\r\nmembers of disloyalty, the authorities in the first stages of the war,\r\ndissolved it. Miroslav Tyrš and Henry Fügner founded the “Sokol Union” in\r\n1862. Body culture is the primary though not the sole aim of the society;\r\nconsidered from its ethical aspect the “Sokol Union” contemplates nothing\r\nless than the moral and physical regeneration of the Bohemian race.\r\nFrom Bohemia the Sokol idea has gradually found its way into other Slav\r\ncountries, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Bulgaria and there are Sokols, men and\r\nwomen, even in America.\r\n\r\nTRAVEL AND DESCRIPTION. The old time travelers like Christian Frederick\r\nDamberger, Georg Robert Gleig, Johann Georg Keysler, Johann Georg Kohl,\r\ndescribed not the kingdom of the Čechs, but Bohemia, the Province of\r\nAustria. After 1621 Bohemia ceased to exist as an independent state and\r\nthe veneer of Teutonism thickened from year to year. So complete seemed\r\nthe denationalization of Bohemia in the eighteenth century and even in\r\nthe first part of the nineteenth, that foreigners visiting the baths at\r\nCarlsbad and Marienbad were surprised to hear peasants talk in an unknown\r\ntongue. As for the real Bohemia, after she had again found herself, no\r\nEnglish or American traveler has more trenchantly described her castles,\r\nher mediæval churches, her splendid ruins, her roads, her industries, her\r\nschools, than James Baker.\r\n\r\nTwo books by travelers of Bohemian nationality might be mentioned,\r\nthough, strictly speaking, they have no place in our Bohemica. They are\r\nDr. Emil Holub’s _Seven Years in South Africa; travels, researches, and\r\nhunting adventures between the diamond fields and the Zambesi_, 1872-79,\r\ntranslated by Ellen Frewer and published in London by Low, Marston, Searle\r\n& Rivington in 1881. The other is B. Kroupa’s _An Artist’s Tour; gleanings\r\nand impressions of travels in North and Central America and the Sandwich\r\nIslands_. With illustrations by the author. Published by Ward & Downey,\r\nLondon, in 1890.\r\n\r\nThe opinion has been expressed that John Lederer, the Virginia traveler,\r\nwas not an Austrian, as some surmise, but a Bohemian.[12] Lederer is by\r\nno means an uncommon surname among Bohemians; moreover, there is evidence\r\nthat Bohemian exiles began settling in Virginia during the Thirty Years’\r\nWar.\r\n\r\n  [12] _The Discoveries of John Lederer, in three several marches from\r\n  Virginia to the west of Carolina, and other parts of the Continent_:\r\n  Begun in March, 1669, and ended in September, 1670. Together with a\r\n  General Map of the whole territory which he traversed. Collected and\r\n  translated out of Latine from his Discourse and Writings by Sir William\r\n  Talbot, Baronet. London.

United we stand, divided we\r\nfall before the Turkish peril, was the chief argument used to effect the\r\nunion of these three states.\r\n\r\n1302, Nov. 10. Westminster.

Whereas of late when the king was passing with\r\nhis army through France certain enemies of the household of the king of\r\nBohemia lying in ambush attacked the king’s clerks, William de Dalton and\r\nWilliam de Hugate, parsons of the churches of Southdalton and Northburton,\r\ntook them and brought them against their will to High Almain, where they\r\ndetain them in captivity, to the king’s distress, he requests the provost\r\nof Beverley, his officers and ministers and all others interested to be\r\nfavorable and gracious to the prisoners in those matters wherein they\r\nhave to do with them, not seeking occasion against them in respect of\r\ntheir beneficies or the fruits thereof, and pardoning William de Dalton if\r\nduring the present impediment he be not ordained to the orders which his\r\nbenefice requires.

Rome. To Henry, Cardinal priest of St. Eusebius’s, papal\r\nlegate. The Pope has from time to time sent divers nuncios and legates for\r\nthe extirpation of heresy in Bohemia and neighbouring parts, but without\r\nresult, nevertheless, he does not lose hope, and daily prays that the\r\nsick flocks may be healed of their leprosy or be cut off from the land\r\nof the living, lest with their contagion they infect others. As the most\r\nfitting leader of the attack on heresy and the defense of the church,\r\nto convert or do battle with the heretics, the pope has singled out the\r\ncardinal for many reasons, his wisdom and prudence, as shown formerly (at\r\nConstance) in the matter of the union of the church, his high lineage,\r\nhis experience of great affairs, the glory of the realm and nation, which\r\nwill make him the more to be feared in war. The pope has therefore made\r\nhim legate a latere throughout all Germany and the realms of Hungary\r\nand Bohemia, and urges him not to refuse to undertake the burden. The\r\nenterprise will bring great and lasting glory to the King of England; etc.\r\nSame, v. 7, p. 30.\r\n\r\n1427, July. Rome. To Henry, Cardinal of England, legate of the Apostolic\r\nsee.

Same, v. 7, p. 34.\r\n\r\n1427, Oct. Rome. To Henry, Cardinal of England, legate of the apostolic\r\nsee.

He commends the cardinal for promptly betaking himself to Bohemia, and\r\nfor his efforts with the princes and the army. The cardinal must persevere\r\nwith his enterprise, and is to strive in season and out of season with\r\nthe princes and prelates of Almain. The clergy and prelates of Almain,\r\nthe archbishops of Cologne and Mainz if they had joined those in Bohemia\r\nas they ought, and as had been arranged, the army would not have retreated\r\nwith such disgrace.

The Bohemish cause might have been compounded by a\r\nfriendly treaty or decided by law, both which the Palatine always desired,\r\nand it had been best for the Empire that it had been ended by law.

Peter Figulus (Komenský’s son-in-law), to\r\nSamuel Hartlib in London. I cannot but bless the name of the Lord our God,\r\nwhenever I get something from you; for I see evidently, that God hath\r\nchosen you long since to be an instrument in his hand, as for many other\r\nhis good works, so likewise to work a Godly comfort and edification in\r\nour souls, whereof all your letters are full. The public letters which\r\nwere sent to you, are subscribed by baron Sadowsky, brother to him that\r\nis in England. They are written in the name of all our exiled nation, and\r\ndirected to the lord protector, his highnes’s council, and the parliament.\r\nThe baron is a very good soldier, hath served long in the Swedish wars,\r\nlongs mightily for some help to the church of God grievously distressed\r\nand afflicted in these quarters by the Papal and Austrian adherents,\r\nbeing willing and resolved to spend himself, and do all what he can to\r\nthat end.... But he and we all leave the whole management of this affair\r\nto the wisdom of the lord protector and his council. Perhaps they will\r\nthereby be moved, or occasioned to take into a more serious deliberation\r\nthe case of our nation, and of us miserable exiles.... The emperor seeks\r\nnothing but the suppression of the Gospel, and a dilatation of the\r\nAustrian power. There is a monk lately converted to our religion, who\r\ntells, that the emperor with the pope are resolved infallibly to make a\r\nwar against the protestants. All the cloisters have promised to such a war\r\nto contribute each of them two soldiers and he tells, that they reckon\r\nunder the emperors dominions 96,000 cloisters or monasteries. But now\r\nthe exacerbation of minds increaseth by the most grievous persecution in\r\nBohemia, Moravia, Silesia and Austria. There are thousands of those, that\r\nwait and pray to God for some Zyska, that would begin a religious war for\r\nthe protestant cause: yet none of the princes in Germany have the courage\r\nto oppose themselves against the house of Austria. B. Sadowsky is fully\r\npersuaded, that God would bless this enterprise thus seconded, and purely\r\ndirected to the glory of God and the relief of the oppressed; especially\r\nif in the meantime the triumphant arms of the Commonwealth of England\r\npermit not the Spaniards to assist the emperor....

A Proposition made by the States of Bohemia in theyr Assembly at\r\nPrague uppon the Election of a Kinge the 16th of August, beinge the\r\nbirthday of the Prince Elector Palatine. Albeit the nomination of a Kinge\r\nof Bohemia requires a mature councell and deliberacion, which ought to\r\nprecede the nomination, it is an affayre notwithstandinge of the lesse\r\ndifficultye then the iejectinge (sic) of a king which gave a beginninge\r\nto this and stands in neede both of a good justification and of a great\r\npower, where (as) the nomination hath of those aydes but follows of\r\nitselfe after the rejection.\r\n\r\nNow therefore, since the iejection (sic) as the things importinge us is\r\nalready done, the nomination wilbe much the more easily provided that in\r\nthe choyse we stand not presisely upon such a perfection as the world\r\ncannot yeild us. It behoves us also to set apart all perticuler passions\r\nand to have regard only to those reasons that are fundamentall, for\r\nthere are requisite points so necessary to be considered in the election\r\nof a Kinge that (it) is not for a good patriot to give his councell for\r\nreceivinge of one in whome those points required is not found, but one may\r\nwith very good assurance conclude for him in whome they doe dayly more\r\nmeete than in any other man.\r\n\r\nAs in the first place in such a subject it is necessary that there be none\r\nof those thinges to be feard; for if Kinge Ferdinand was rejected, that\r\nis to say, he ought not eyther to prosecute or advance in the respect\r\nof religion nor exceede in the dependance of his owne counsaylors or\r\nof strangers, but to joine himselfe with the States he ought not to be\r\nopiniative nor given to doe thinges of his owne head, but to accomadate\r\nthe customes of his house and his to the ordinances and liberties of thys\r\ncrowne.\r\n\r\nIn the second place it is required that he affect the States’ reputation.\r\n\r\nThirdly, that in time both of peace and warr he governe his Kingdome by\r\nhis owne presence worthyly and profitably.\r\n\r\nFourthly, that confederates receive no cause of feare from eyther of\r\ndanger or damage. Since then there are few that are inferred into the\r\ntreaty of eleccion, that is to say, the Kinge of Denmarke, the Elector\r\nPalatine, the Elector of Saxoni, the Duke of Savoy, and the Prince of\r\nTransilvania, yt will therefore be to purpose to consider that, although\r\nevery one of these princes in his owne perticuler deserveth prayse and\r\ncommendation, neverthelesse there is amongst them a certaine diversity\r\nwhich everyone by himselfe may prudently waigh. And forasmuch as it is\r\nnot permitted us to judge liberally of great princes in this place, it\r\nshall suffice without offence of any breifely to deduce the reasons for\r\nwhich the Elector Palatine ought to be esteemed very capable of the crowne\r\nof Bohemia, and fitt to mainteyne the present estate of the kingdome,\r\nfor although his highnesse be not above 23 yeeres of age, he is a prince\r\nof great judgement bred up from his cradle in goodnesse and vertue, one\r\nthat hath persons of quality about him as well of the feild as for the\r\nstate who are used to curteisy, and himselfe of very plentifull hopes, and\r\nbesides at this age he will better accomodate himselfe to the customes of\r\nthe kingdome then if he were more increased in yeares; and God bestows not\r\nwisdome alwayes according to the age of a man, but to him that calls to\r\nGod for it in His feare.\r\n\r\nHe is a prince moderate, virtuos and resolute in his actions, quick and\r\nsharpe in his discourse, true, courteous towards all men, very well\r\nlanguaged, holds a very fayre court of earls, barrons and gentlemen,\r\nloves and cherishes the nobility, imployes in his service even men of\r\nmeane condition when he finds meritt in them for it. He letts no worthy\r\nservice passe him without his acknowledgement, he governs his subjects\r\nand country (in part the frontives of this kingdome) with prudence, gives\r\nestimation to men of honor, holds a well ordered councell, frequents the\r\ncouncell table in his owne person, takes an exact heed of the opinions\r\nand propositions of his councellors, gives good cause of havinge his\r\njudgement approv’d and commended of thinges of importance, inclines his\r\nunderstandinge willingely to other mens information, loves the common good\r\nand therein takes paines with zeale and without feare, beares compassion\r\nto the afflicted, shewes himselfe laborious and resolved, is beloved\r\nof his subjects, beares himselfe peaceably with his neighbors of what\r\nreligion soever they be, and winnes respect of those different beliefs for\r\nhis owne religion. He is well affected, yet those who are of another fayth\r\nin his countries doe not find themselves disquieted in their consciences\r\nnor in their exercise of their religion, so as every man may live freely\r\nunder him, videlicet, his conversation be honest and vertous. There is\r\nnone can abuse or accuse him of precipitation or opinatives (sic), a thing\r\nworthy remarkeable (sic).\r\n\r\nHe is in correspondence with those of the house of Palatine and Bavoirs\r\nand, notwithstandinge so, that cause forsakes nothinge of those rightes\r\nnor of the duties belonginge to the generall estate of the country, and\r\nhowsoever that this prince be but younge and shewes himselfe courteous\r\nand sweet towards his people, for all that there is no lightnesse,\r\ndissollutions (sic) nor voluptuousnesse seene in him nor any disorder\r\nnor excesse in his diett nor any avarice and digality (sic) or any other\r\nthinge whatsoever unbecominge or contrary to the reputation of a prince.\r\nFor the assistance the crowne of Bohemia may expect from him, it may be\r\nunderstoode of any man that not only he is not in debt, and that of his\r\nrevenue he can lay some things upp, but that also the Kinge of Great\r\nBrittaine is his father-in-law, the Kinge of Denmark is his neere kinsman,\r\nand likewise the Elector of Brandenbourh, the Prince of Orenge his uncle,\r\nthe Duke of Bullion his ally, the States of the United Provinces his\r\nconfederates, and ancient alliances with France, the Kinge of Sweden and\r\nthe Hanse Townes his friends, and for his correspondents the Duke of\r\nSavoi, Venice and Switzerland. He is a good credit with all the Princes\r\nElectors and other princes and Estates of the Empire, more perticulerly\r\nwith those of the Union he hath confederacies, the Prince of Transsilvania\r\nand High Hungary doe beare affection to him, Saxonie and Bavoir are in\r\ngood termes with him, Mentz and the neighbouring countries looke uppon him\r\nwith honor and respect, insomuch as the crowne of Bohemia by this only\r\nmeanes may procure the amity of all those which we doe now labour for\r\nwith so much paine and travell, and by the same meanes may be conserved\r\nand fortified against our enimies, which cannot of any other nominated in\r\nthe election be eyther expected or hoped for. And since it is a certainty\r\nthat this prince would not accept of the election for Ambition sake, but\r\nonly for the common good, we may therefore promise ourselves that he will\r\nalwayes continue in the good affection he hath already shewed to this\r\ncrowne by the profitable counsell and assistances which as well as his\r\nowne person as other wayes according to the occasions he hath made to\r\nappeare, where (as) there are some others that for for theyr perticuler\r\nconservations have greatly prejudiced not only the estates of the kingdome\r\nof Bohemia but the countries also and provinces confederats.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the sayd confederated provinces are to consider whoe are already\r\nin good understandinge with this prince, that they cannot have the like\r\nconfidence in others who are to much tyed in the respect of the house of\r\nAustria to succour the sayd provinces in theyr neede, and in such a case\r\nthe confederations would bring them prejudice rather than benefitt, a\r\npoint of great waight touchinge this crowne as may be seene by experience.\r\n\r\nSince then that all these qualities required doe meete in the person\r\nof the Prince Elector, and that in those of the others treated in the\r\nelection (the Prince of Transilvania excepted, who hath his eye upon\r\nanother marke) there are many imperfections to be found, as may easily\r\nbe shewed, it is therefore a matter to no purpose longer to defer the\r\nelection, and so much the rather because the crowne of Bohemia with the\r\ncountries confederate will now after the rejection be more disquieted\r\nthan ever; and remayning without a head we shall find none whoe will duly\r\nundertake our protection or defence.

The joyfull receivinge, triumphant entronce and stately formall\r\ncoronation of Fredericke, the Prince Elector Palatine, and the Lady\r\nElizabeth, Princesse Electoresse, King and Queen of Bohemia, on Munday and\r\nThursday the 25th and 28th day of October ould stile, 1619.\r\n\r\nIt is knowne unto all men for what weightie reasons the States of the\r\nkingdome of Bohemia and of the incorporated countries have with one joynte\r\nconsent excluded Kinge Ferdinand from the kingedome, and have in his\r\nplace, with an especially mutuall agreement, chosen and named for theire\r\nkinge the right highe and mightie Prince Fredricke by the grace of God\r\nErle Palatine of the Rhyne, Duke of both the Bavaries, Prince Elector\r\nand Vicar of the Romane Empire, whome after a lawfull callinge they have\r\ncrowned on the 4th and 7th dayes of November, newe stile, that is, the\r\n25th and 28th of October, ould stile, 1619.\r\n\r\nUppon the 21-31 of October, 1619, afternoone, came his Majestie with\r\nthe Queene his wife, the younger prince theire eldest sonne, his Lord\r\nbrother Duke Lodowicke, the Duke of Wertemberge, the 2 Princes of Anhalt,\r\ntogether with his whole retinue, consistinge of five companies of curast\r\nhorsemen, 500 harquebus horsemen, and 3 auncients of footemen of 300 a\r\npeece, with many coatches and a very greate number of wagons laden with\r\nthe carriages towards Prague, and beinge come within 2 or 3 Englishe miles\r\nthere of into a faire pleasant place be a parke called the Starre, where\r\nthe Lords, the States of the kingdome of Bohemia and of the incorporated\r\ncountryes of Moravia, Silesia and both of Lusatiæs, with the magistrates\r\nand chiefe men of the 3 citties of Prague, attended his Majesties cominge,\r\naccompanied with about a 1000 horse, very statelie and well appointed;\r\nthere the(y) alighted and received him out of his coatche with greate\r\nstate, honor and reverence, unto whome the Baron of Tallenberge, Lord\r\nGreate Chamberlaine, made a speech in the Bohemian tongue, which the\r\nBarron of Ruppa interpreted in Dutche; his Majestie gave thereunto so good\r\nan answere as that the States much rejoyced thereat, which done, they came\r\none after another, kneeled downe and kissed his Majesties hand. In like\r\nrespect every way was the Queene received, save that they kneeled not unto\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThen his Majestie mounted on horsebacke, but yett stayed a whyle, till the\r\nlords and gentry were also mounted and that theire Coronell Kinski had\r\norderly marshall’d them, whose discipline his Majestie well liked. Then\r\nthe(y) marched on conductinge his Majestie towerds Prague; when he came\r\ninto the cittie, the citizens of the 3 citties of Prague stoode in armes,\r\nvery bravely appointed, as well on horsebacke as on foote on both sides of\r\nthe street and open places, makeinge a lane or courte or guarde frome the\r\nentringe in of the cittie unto the castle; theire Majesties rid alonge,\r\nand that in this manner.\r\n\r\nThey of the little cittie were one cornett of horse with 6 trumpetts\r\nand one kettledrumme, they of the newe cittie one cornett of horse with\r\n6 trumpetts and one kettledrumme, they of the ould cittie one cornett of\r\nhorse with 6 trumpetts and one kettledrumme, as also another companie of\r\n200 horse voluntary well-willers, and 7 companies of foote, all citizens,\r\nexceedingly well mounted and furnished.\r\n\r\nAnd when his Majestie came nere unto the newe forte and bullwarke before\r\nthe castle, whereon stood a companie on foote with a displayed ancient,\r\nthere were standinge 400 boures or husband and laboringe countrymen\r\nrepresentinge the communalty and 4th state or parte of the land, all\r\narmed accordinge to the ould and auncient custome and manner of their\r\ncountry, videlicet, they had an ould weatherbeaten ancient wherein was\r\npainted the name Ziseha (sic),[19] theire auncient captaine or generall\r\nand deliverer, with a challice, and the hoste or signe of a wafer, eache\r\ntheire armes of the ould fashion, a hevy brestplate, a massie headepeece\r\nto assault and scale with all, wooden clubes set with iron spikes, iron\r\nflayles of threshalle, crosbowes, great iron sheildes, with 2-handed\r\nswords, and stood in battaile array as Lizeha (sic) had in his time\r\nappointed them. When his Majestie came unto them he stayed a while and was\r\nby theire captaine entertained and welcommed with a Lattine ovation, who\r\ndid greatlie congratulate his Majesties comeinge, and havinge concluded,\r\nthe multitude began to cry out, Vivat, vivat Rex Fredericus! and so ran\r\ntogether to route on a heape one amongst another, makinge such a greate\r\nnoyse with theire armes as that his Majestie tooke greate pleasure thereat\r\nand could not forbeare laughter. Before his Majestie there marched 400\r\nhorsemen under theire Coronell Kinsby (sic), representinge the knightehood\r\nand gentry of the land, who had 8 silver trumpetts and 4 other trumpetts\r\nwith 8 cettledrummes; theire cornett was of blew damaske whereon were the\r\nPrince Elector Palatine’s armes richly imbrodered; the Lords Derectors\r\nand States of the land followed after bravelie mounted; after them rid\r\nthe Duke of Mansterberge (sic) of Silesia, haveinge on his right hand the\r\nDuke of Wertemberge and on the left hand the younge Prince of Anhalt.\r\nThen rid his Majestie’s Lord brother Lodowicke with ould Prince Dhinstion\r\n(Christian) of Anhalt, after whome imediatelie followed his kinglie\r\nMajestie on a blacke greate horse covered with a blacke footeclothe\r\nall over imbrodered with silver. Then followed the Queene ridinge in a\r\nexceeding rich coatch, like the whereof had never beene seene afore in\r\nPrague, and by her sate the younge Prince her sonne; after her Majestie\r\ncame 2 other coatches wherein were the wives and daughters of divers\r\nprinces and earles, after which followed sundry other coatches with many\r\ngentlewoemen, maides of honor and others, and after these came lastly the\r\nPrince Electors owne coronell and harquebus horsemen and footemen in good\r\norder, the horsemen well mounted, all statelie deckt with brave attire,\r\nfaire liveries and gallant scarfes of blewe, the King’s colours.\r\n\r\n  [19] John Žižka, the Hussite.\r\n\r\nThis ridinge through the cittie lasted 3 houres longe, and was beheld of\r\nmany thousands of people to theire greate admiracion; his Majestie tooke\r\ntherein greate pleasure and did oftentimes put off his hatt, and with a\r\nchearefull countenance bowe himselfe towerds the people, as did also the\r\nQueene both chearefully and with greate majestie. When they were come\r\nwithin the castle court there the(y) sawe a man sittinge above uppon the\r\nchurche with an auncient in his hand and waveing it over his heade, and\r\nthen another man sittinge uppon the rounde ball on the steeple toppe, who\r\nplayed a longe time uppon a kettledrumme.\r\n\r\nIn the castle court theire Majesties alighted nere unto the longe hall\r\nand went towerds the greene chamber, where there stoode a great number\r\nof Bohemian laydes and gentlewoemen of good rancke richly attired, who\r\nreceived her Majestie with greate reverence, and so attended on her into\r\nher lodgings. All things were accomplished with such state, honor, and\r\ngood successe as the like was never yett done unto any Romane Emperor; all\r\nwhich shall shortlie be cutt in brasse, and made publicke unto the viewe\r\nof the worlde.\r\n\r\nHere followeth the King’s coronacion.\r\n\r\nAll the highe officers of the kingdome as of nobilitie the Lord Chiefe\r\nBurgrave Lord Bhonstowe, Barron of Bercha, the Lord Highe Steward of\r\nthe Lands, Lord Wilham Lobkowth or Belkowth Barron, Lord de (sic) High\r\nChamberlaine Lord John Barron of Tallonberge, the Lord Chiefe Justice\r\nof the land, Lord Wentzeslawe, William Barron of Ruppa, the Lord Highe\r\nChancellour Lord Paul Barron of Ritschan, the Lord Chiefe Justice of the\r\nFeodaries, Lord Peter Barron of Schambergke, the Lord Chiefe Burgrave of\r\nCharlestone, Lord Joachim, Andrew Erle of Sclicke, Knights of the gentry,\r\nthe Chiefe Secretary of the land, Caspar Caepler, Undertreasurer Procopius\r\nDirarssetche, Underburgrave of Charlestone Bohnslaire of Micholowth, and\r\nthe Burgrave of the knightlie province, or tract of Grotzer, Henry Ottoe\r\nof Losse and many others, beinge summoned and come the 22th of Octob. ould\r\nstile, 2 (sic) Novemb. newe stile, to give their attendance, and doe\r\ntheir service at the coronacion, the same was done on Munday the 4th of\r\nNovemb. newe stile, that is the 25 of October. ould stile in the manner as\r\nfolloweth.\r\n\r\nFirst after the lords, the States, had attended his Majestie into the\r\ncastle churche and brought him into St. Wentzeslawes chappell, there they\r\nputt uppon his Majestie the regall robe, which was a longe white sattine\r\nor damaske gowne all over imbroidered with goulde; before went 40 preists,\r\nsingeinge men and querresters in white surplices, then behinde them 7\r\nother more principall preists in blewishe or violett cloakes with rich\r\ntaffitie hatts of the same collor; after them followed the officers of the\r\nkingedome carryinge the jewells and ensignes belongeing to the coronation,\r\nas namely, the hereditary Archbutler of the kingedome of Bohemia with a\r\ngilded silver tunne, the hereditarie Archcupberer with a silver potte,\r\nand 2 others followinge them, bearinge 2 gilded bowles; the(n) followed\r\nthe Lord High Steward of the land with the scepter, the Lord Chiefe\r\nJustice of the kingedome with the regall ball, the Archburkgrave with\r\nthe crowne, bearinge it in bothe his hands; after went the Heralde of\r\nthe kingedome Bohemia in his coate of armes with a white staffe in his\r\nhand, then the hereditarie Lord High Marshall of the crowne of Bohemia\r\nwith the regall electorall sworde in a red velvett sheathe, after whome\r\nimmediatelie followed his Majestie bareheaded, havinge on the right hand\r\nthe Lord Administrator of the Bohemian Protestant Colledge and on his left\r\nside another Bohemian preacher (who afterwards made the sermon), both\r\nof them attyred in blacke velvett gownes. These 2 brought his Majestie\r\nunto the alter, where they kneeled downe with him and prayed a while,\r\nand then goeinge backe from the alter, they sett his Majestie in a faire\r\nchaire of hayre-colored vellvett, who returneinge to the alter, the Lord\r\nAdministrator began to act and reade aloude certaine statutes of Lattine,\r\nwhich done, the trumpetts sounded a greate noise; after was begun to be\r\nsunge in Lattine Veni Sancte Spiritus, and thereuppon in the Bohemian\r\ntongue God the Father dwell us by was also sunge, a collect reade, and the\r\npreacher putt on his white surplice, went up into the pulpitt to preach\r\nin the Bohemian speech. After he had propounded the matter he was to\r\ntreate of, and prayed, he stayed there till the people had sunge the 20th\r\nPsalme also in the Bohemian language; then he went on with his sermon,\r\nand yet in the meanewhile, betweene the partes thereof, were 3 severall\r\ntimes Bohemian hymnes sunge; the sermon beinge ended the foresaid Lord\r\nAdministrator went againe to the alter and did there in Lattine singe the\r\nLetany, which done, the trumpetts and musicke made a marveilous sweete\r\nmelodie, which done, a chapter out of the Apostle Paule to Timothy was\r\nreade before the altar, and 2 Bohemian himnes sunge; this ended, the Lord\r\nAdministrator, with the preacher, the Lord Chief Burgrave, the Lord High\r\nSteward and Lord Greate Chamberlaine of the land, attended his Majestie\r\nto the alter, where they all kneeled downe and prayed againe. Then\r\nthey stoode up and, haveinge spoken unto his Majestie concerninge the\r\naccustomed oathe he was to take, the Lord Chiefe Burgrave spake thrice\r\nalone unto the people to this effect: “Seeing we are nowe aboute to\r\ncrowne his Majestie, it is thought meete againe to admonishe you joyntlie\r\nto tell us freelie, whether it be your wills that we shall proceede on\r\nforwards and crowne his Majestie?” Whereupon the people with a full and\r\njointe consent cryed out amaine and said everie time, “We will.” Then the\r\nLord Cheife Burgrave held a booke unto his Majestie, whereon his Majestie\r\nhaveing laide his 2 fingers, the Lord Cheife Burgrave reade the accustomed\r\noathe unto him in the Bohemian tongue, which his Majestie performed unto\r\nthe Lords the States repeatinge every word of it after the Lord Chief\r\nBurgrave. Then his Majestie kneeled downe before the altar, where the\r\nLord Administrator stoode before him, holdinge on the booke a gilded box,\r\nwherein was oyle, of which he tooke a little with one finger and anointed\r\ntherewith his Majestie’s foreheade, strekeinge it in forme of a crosse.\r\nThis beinge done, the Lord High Marshall delivered the sword into the\r\nhands of the Lord Administrator, who took it and presentlie gave it to his\r\nMajestie, sayinge these wordes: Per Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum Amen.\r\n\r\nAfter this he delivered unto him, first the scepter, then the regall ball,\r\nput a red velvett cap upon his heade, and the lord Administrator takeinge\r\nup the crowne in his hands, whereon the Lord Chiefe Burgrave, the Lord\r\nHighe Steward of the land, the Lord Great Chamberlaine of the land, and\r\nthe other preist or minister tooke holde, and so joyntly sett the crowne\r\nuppon his Majesties head in the name of the Holy and Blessed Indivisible\r\nTrinitie, and then (he) was by them all lifted up, attended to his chaire\r\nand sett therein with the crowne upon his heade and the ball and scepter\r\nin his hands. Now when all this was done the Lord Cheife Burgrave said\r\nunto the Lords the States: “My Lords, seeinge our gracious Kinge is\r\nalready crowned, so are we nowe accordinge unto our custome to sweare\r\nallegeance unto him and to the crowne and acknowledge him for our gracious\r\nKinge and lord.” Hereupon the Lord Cheife Burgrave kissed the regall ball,\r\nhis Majestie’s right hand, touched the crowne with his 2 fingers, bowed\r\nhimself before his Majestie, and so went aside, giveinge way. About an\r\n100 persons did all the like. After this did the Lord Administratour with\r\na loude voyce singe Te Deum laudamus. This followed the whole musicke,\r\ncornetts, saggebutts, trumpetts, kettledrummes; the bells in all three\r\ncitties of Prague did ringe, 28 peeces of great ordinance made readie for\r\nthe purpose were discharged, and the citizens and souldiers of the cittie,\r\nbeinge 13 companies of foote and sundry cornetts of horse, discharged all\r\ntheire ouer (sic).\r\n\r\nAfter that his Majestie had (sittinge in his coronation chaire) knighted\r\n5 lords and 3 gentlemen, he rose and went thence attended with all the\r\nlords others to the records of the land, where also accordinge to auncient\r\nuse and custome he sware to preserve and mainetaine them and subscribed\r\nunto all he was to subscribe unto. Where as his Majestie went and returned\r\nthere were divers sorts of coynes of gould and silver throwne amongst\r\nthe people, one of which had on the one side this inscription, God and\r\ntheire (sic) cuntryes have given unto me this crowne, and on the other\r\nside were five hands houldinge on a crowne, signifying the kingedome of\r\nBohemia and the 4 incorporated cuntries. All alonge the streetes, and\r\nwithin the castle whereupon his Majestie rid and went to the records of\r\nthe land, there was broade clothe spreade on the ground, which at his\r\ncomeing backe was all given for larges and made prizd unto the people. At\r\nhis comeinge backe into the castle dinner was made ready, where was one\r\ntable of state prepared, whereat his Majestie sate in his regall robes\r\nwith the crowne on his heade, and the Queene with him. There were other\r\ntables besides furnished as whereat sate the above said greate officers\r\nand the rest of the Lords the States, and the(n) 14 other free tables\r\nfor strangers: within the castle court there were goodlie fountaines\r\nmade, which untill night ran plentifullie with wine red and white free\r\nfor all to take of that would. About the midst of dinner his Majestie,\r\nthe crowne to be taken off, stoode up and dranke into the health of all\r\nthe 3 states and Bohemia, and caused it to be drunke round aboute hall.\r\nIn the interim betweene his Majestie’s coronacion and the Queene’s, his\r\nMajestie first confirmed all the officers and governours of the kingedome\r\nin theire offices and governmentes, commanndinge justice and government\r\nto goe on in the ordinarie due course as was meete and requisite. Then\r\nnext perceivinge that the stewes and brothelhouses were there still in\r\nuse and tollerated, and had theire house within the bulwarke round aboute\r\nthe cittie, and withall a world of poore and needy people as well of able\r\nbodyes as aged, sicke and impotent, lyinge and standinge in the streets\r\nto the great dishonor of God and of religion, his Majestie both put downe\r\nthe stewes presentlie and commannded an hospitall and house of correccion\r\nto be forthwith builded; that so theis aged, sicke and impotent might be\r\nsufficientlie relived and mainetained and the idle bodie to be put into\r\ngives and forced to worke and labour for theire liveinge, that so both\r\nthe cittie and the state might be eased and clensed of all such, as is his\r\nowne cuntry.\r\n\r\nThe Queene’s coronacion was on Thursday the 28th of October ould stile in\r\nall respects like the Kinge’s saye that the sermon was in High Dutche and\r\nno coynes cast about thereat.

OMAHA, NEB., SEPTEMBER 1, 1892.        No. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\nOnce Protestant, Bohemia at present is overwhelmingly Catholic. In 1890\r\nthe Catholics numbered 96.17 per cent, the Protestants 2.22 per cent and\r\nthe Jews 1.56 per cent. It must be borne in mind, however, that prior to\r\n1781, in which year the “Patent of Toleration” was issued, no other church\r\nwas tolerated outside the Catholic.\r\n\r\n                               *   *\r\n                                 *\r\n\r\nBohemia may be said to be a country of farmers, judging from the number\r\nof persons engaged in agricultural pursuits. Out of every one thousand\r\npeople 408.7 per cent are engaged in the cultivation of soil and forestry;\r\n352.6 per cent find employment in manufacturing and mining, 59.5 per cent\r\nin commerce, railroading, etc., and 87.8 per cent earn their living as\r\nlaborers.\r\n\r\n                               *   *\r\n                                 *\r\n\r\nIlliteracy in Bohemia is rapidly disappearing. According to the general\r\ncensus of 1890 the ratio of adults unable to read and write is 19.69 per\r\ncent, which compares favorably with that of the most advanced of European\r\nnations. Figures compiled in 1881 show the ratio of illiteracy to be in\r\nEngland, 16 per cent; Scotland, 12; Ireland, 33; France, 22; Germany, 6;\r\nRussia, 89; Austria 51 (education is especially backward in Hungary and\r\nTransylvania); Italy, 59; Spain and Portugal, 66; Switzerland, 12, Belgium\r\nand Holland, 14; Scandinavia, 13.\r\n\r\n                               *   *\r\n                                 *\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, the natives do not call their country “Bohemia,” but\r\n_Cechy_, nor themselves “Bohemians,” but “Cechs,” pron. “Chekhs” or\r\n“Czechs.” Tradition has it that the leader’s name who conducted the first\r\nSlav tribe to Bohemia was Cech, hence the race name. The Latin chroniclers\r\nof the Middle Ages were altogether ignorant of this, and persisted in\r\ncalling the people who bore it Bohemians, and thus the Slavs of Bohemia\r\ninherited the name of the Boii (Germanic race) whom they had displaced.\r\n\r\n                               *   *\r\n                                 *\r\n\r\nSuperintendent of the Census Bureau, Mr. Porter, would hardly sanction the\r\nmethod adopted by the Austrian government in determining the nationality\r\nof a people. In Bohemia the _language_ spoken is the test. Americans or\r\nIrishmen would, therefore, in Austria, be classed as “English,” because\r\nthey speak that language. This ingenious method is highly “useful,”\r\nespecially in the present conflict of races, for it helps to bolster up\r\nthe minority in the land, deceiving many as to the actual strength of the\r\nChekhs, thousands of whom use the German language in business and social\r\nrelations. Accepting the language as a test, 62.79 per cent were found\r\nin 1890 in Bohemia to “use” the Bohemian and 37.19 per cent the German\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\nAustria is a perfect mosaic of races. This diversity is best exemplified\r\nin the complexion of the schools, where all the dominant languages of the\r\nmonarchy clamor for recognition. There are universities at Vienna, Prague,\r\nGratz, Innsbruck, Cernovice, Cracow, Lwow, Buda-Pesth, Kolosvar and\r\nZagreb. The universities in Vienna, Gratz, Innsbruck and Cernovice teach\r\nin German; the Prague in Chekh; that of Lwow in Polish and Ruthenian; that\r\nof Cracow in Polish; those of Buda-Pesth and Kolosvar in Magyar; that of\r\nZagreb in Croatian.\r\n\r\n                               *   *\r\n                                 *\r\n\r\nAn Englishman traveling through Bohemia thus describes the people in the\r\n_Illustrated News_: “As for the people there was not a sign of the dreamy\r\nsadness and strange mysticism of the Slav that one is forever reading\r\nabout. They worked with a dogged energy and commonplace industry that\r\nwould not have been out of the way in Zola’s peasants. In no other country\r\nis it so impossible to remain unconscious of the surplus population\r\nquestion and the hopelessness of the peasant’s fate. In Germany, or during\r\nour rides in France, in Italy, in England we sometimes had the road to\r\nourselves; in Bohemia, never. There was always someone just behind us or\r\nin front of us.” This latter statement about the density of population\r\nwill be understood when we remember that but 4½ per cent. of all the land\r\nin Bohemia is not under cultivation.\r\n\r\n                               *   *\r\n                                 *\r\n\r\nLike Ireland Bohemia is governed by a lieutenant governor appointed by\r\nthe sovereign. The highest legislative power in the land is the diet\r\nconvoking in Prague and composed of 242 members elected by the people.\r\nOne archbishop, three bishops and two university rectors, however, hold\r\ntheir seats by virtue of office. As may be imagined the power the diet\r\nexercises is very limited, the deliberations depending on the pleasure\r\nor displeasure of the emperor, who selects the presiding officer. The\r\nlatter is styled as the “marshal,” or “high marshal.” The diet has the\r\nprerogative of electing a standing committee of eight members known as\r\nthe “land committee” (zemsky vybor) and over this committee again the\r\nmarshal presides. For political and administrative purposes the country\r\nis divided into circles, the circles are sub-divided into captaincies.\r\nThe two crownlands, Moravia and Silesia, have each 100 and 31 deputies in\r\ntheir home diets, respectively. The government officials, though great\r\nreforms have taken place of late, are far from popular. This is especially\r\nthe case with the military captains, for whom the people conceive as much\r\nliking as the Italians had for Radetzky and Pachta. Insufferably stiff,\r\ncold, repellent and severe, they were regarded by the people as the source\r\nof all their woes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE BOHEMIAN REVIEW\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL ORGAN OF THE BOHEMIAN (CZECH) NATIONAL ALLIANCE OF AMERICA\r\n\r\n Jaroslav F.

FEBRUARY, 1917.         10 cents a Copy\r\n                                                  $1.00 per Year\r\n\r\n                      _Masaryk and His Work_\r\n\r\nA patriot desires but one reward: that he should live to see his labors\r\nbear fruit. On January 12, 1917, thousands of Czechs in the United\r\nStates found time in the midst of their joyous celebration of the dawn\r\nof Bohemia’s independence to remember the grand old man of Bohemia,\r\nThomas Garigue Masaryk. He it was who put the ancient kingdom of Bohemia\r\nonce more upon the map of Europe. On the day when the Allies’ answer to\r\nPresident Wilson was published, he surely was happy, for he had proof that\r\nhis titanic labors, his tremendous personal and family sacrifices were not\r\nmade in vain. Bohemia’s right to independence was clearly recognized by\r\nthe Allies and the liberation of the country from foreign domination was\r\nmade one of the conditions of peace.\r\n\r\nFor centuries no one in Bohemia did more than dream of independence. This\r\nSlav country had been subject to the Hapsburgs for so many generations\r\nand so thoroughly was it repressed that even the boldest spirits among\r\nits leaders regretfully put aside all thoughts of absolute freedom as\r\nvisionary and aimed merely at securing for the lands of the Bohemian crown\r\nthe widest possible autonomy within the confines of the Austrian Empire.\r\nOn several occasions during the long reign of Francis Joseph the Czechs\r\ncame near to the realization of these moderate ambitions, but always the\r\nemperor drew back unable to give up his ambition to be the German ruler of\r\nGerman or Germanized subjects.\r\n\r\nOf late years the struggle of the Czechs for a certain amount of liberty\r\nat home and for the right to participate in the government of the Empire\r\nwas growing more and more hopeless. The general European situation was\r\nundergoing a change greatly to the disadvantage of Bohemia. The Hapsburg\r\nrealm was losing its standing as a great power, due mainly to the constant\r\ninternal dissensions and language disputes, while the truly national\r\nstates of Europe were growing in population, wealth and military power.\r\nAbove all Germany, excelling in industrial and military preparedness,\r\naggressive and domineering, was looking for new worlds to conquer. America\r\nwas out of the question, for the United States was guarding jealously\r\nagainst the invasion of the two western continents through its Monroe\r\ndoctrine. Germany’s African colonies were unsuitable for colonization by\r\nwhite men and constituted merely a financial burden. Only Asia offered\r\nan undeveloped field--the ramshackle Turkish Empire--and to that land of\r\npromise the road from Germany led through the dual empire and the Balkan\r\nstates. Prague was the first stage on the Berlin-Bagdad highway, and\r\nthe Czech people were the first obstacle to German expansion. It was a\r\npart of Germany’s plan to reduce Austria to complete subserviency by the\r\nexaltation of its German minority and a more thorough repression of the\r\nSlav and Latin races, with the assistance of the Magyars.\r\n\r\nThere were not lacking statemen in Bohemia who saw whither things were\r\ntending. Two of them stand out above the other Czech patriots: Dr. Charles\r\nKramar and Professor Thomas G. Masaryk. Kramar, the leader of the Young\r\nCzech party, for years representative of the middle class of Bohemia,\r\nyielded to no one in his devotion to the race from which he sprang or in\r\nthe sincerity of his intentions to serve the Czech people to the best\r\nof his great ability. But being a wealthy manufacturer, a “practical”\r\nman, intent upon gaining results in the Vienna parliament, he failed to\r\ndraw the only conclusion necessitated by the changed European situation\r\nwhich he so well understood. He realized that Germany was “peacefully\r\npenetrating” the Danube monarchy, that the very existence of the Czech\r\nnation was imperiled; on the floor of the parliament and in the Austrian\r\ndelegation\r\n\r\n  [Transcriber's Note: End of transcriptions.]",
