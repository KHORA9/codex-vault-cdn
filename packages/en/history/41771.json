Datus of Sulu not descended from Abu Bakr      158\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first object sought in the search for the Genealogy of Sulu was\r\na knowledge of those significant historical events of Sulu which\r\nantedated the Spanish discovery and conquest of the Philippine\r\nIslands, the connection which those events might have had with the\r\nearlier history of the other islands and the light that they might\r\nthrow upon the subject of prehistoric Malayan immigration to the\r\nArchipelago. The tarsila (genealogies) [1] of Mindanao show that\r\nevents of considerable importance had occurred in the Archipelago,\r\nespecially in the south, long before the Portuguese or the Spaniards\r\nreached Malaysia. Some tribes, such as the Samals, we were told, had\r\nemigrated from western Malaysia to the Sulu Archipelago and Mindanao,\r\nand indications were not wanting that probably other tribes, now\r\ninhabiting the Philippine Islands, came from the same place. Further,\r\ninformation was desired relative to the mohammedanization of Sulu and\r\nthe possible connection that such a movement might have had with the\r\nintroduction of Islam into Sumatra and Malacca.\r\n\r\nThe research so conducted was well rewarded. The history of Sulu\r\nwas traced as far back as the early days of its oldest settlements,\r\nand the organization of the nation was followed back to the primitive\r\ncommunities out of which the Sulu nation has grown. Records of early\r\nMalayan expeditions and of communication between Sulu and Mindanao\r\nwere traced to the earliest missionaries who reached these Islands\r\nby the way of Malacca, and through whom the sultanates of Mindanao\r\nand Sulu were organized on plans similar to those of Malacca and\r\nPalembang. A fuller account of the life history and work of these\r\nmissionaries will be given in a later paper of this series. We here\r\ngive only a narrative of the events in which they participated and\r\nthe part they played in making the history of Sulu proper.\r\n\r\nMany difficulties were encountered in the effort to secure an authentic\r\ncopy of the Genealogy of Sulu. Several trips of 20 to 40 miles were\r\nmade in small Moro sailing craft to visit datus who were said to have\r\ncopies of this document. The Sulu authorities who had the manuscript\r\nor copies of it denied this fact from time to time, but after two\r\nyears and a half of persistent endeavor and inquiry, the original\r\nmanuscript was procured from the prime minister of the Sultan of Sulu,\r\nwhose confidence was gained by a long period of intimate acquaintance\r\nand frequent communication. Soon after that, the Annals of Sulu (the\r\nLuntar) were obtained from the sultan and some facts of importance were\r\nlearned and made use of in the course of this work. Diligent effort was\r\nfurther made to collect all interesting Sulu traditions and documents,\r\nand most of the best informed Sulus living were interviewed. Of these\r\nthe author feels under special obligation to mention Sheikh Mustafa\r\nbin Ahmad, formerly prime minister to Sultan Harun; Hadji Butu, prime\r\nminister of the present Sultan of Sulu; Datu Pangiran; and Hadji\r\nMohammed Tayib, one of the principal advisers of the present sultan.\r\n\r\nAfter the first object sought had been gained, it became apparent\r\nthat a general public interest in Sulu and Mindanao had been growing\r\nrapidly. It therefore seemed advisable to complete the history of\r\nSulu up to the date of Spanish evacuation, for no such work has as\r\nyet been published in the English language. It is of special interest\r\nto Americans living in Mindanao and Sulu and of general interest to\r\nAmericans and others elsewhere to have a better understanding of the\r\nMoros in general and to acquire some idea of the history of Islam\r\nin the Philippine Islands. This the history of Sulu makes possible\r\nfor the reader in a most vivid and realistic manner. The history is\r\nwritten without prejudice or bias, and events are related as they\r\nappear in the light of facts, and by one capable of seeing things\r\nfrom the standpoint of a Sulu as well as of a Spaniard.\r\n\r\nNothing reveals the true character of a nation, its capabilities,\r\ntendencies, and resources, better than its history. There is no time\r\nwhen such general intimate knowledge of a people is more interesting\r\nand more needed than during the period of their regeneration, and\r\nthere can be no time when the history of the Sulus will be more\r\ninteresting than at present.\r\n\r\nBesides the Moro sources above referred to, several authors in Spanish\r\nand English have been consulted and quoted with due credit. Special\r\nindebtedness must however be expressed to Col. Miguel S. Espina,\r\nauthor of \"Apuntes sobre Jolo,\" whose admirable work has been our\r\nchief authority for the majority of the events which occurred after\r\nthe Spanish invasion of Sulu in 1578. Espina saw considerable service\r\nin Sulu, was intimately acquainted with the Spanish administration of\r\nSulu affairs, and most of his information was derived from official\r\ndocuments and other sources of equal authenticity. Most of the events\r\nrelating to the late period of Spanish occupation of Sulu have been\r\nconfirmed by personal investigation, and the Sulu view of every matter\r\nof significance has been studied and understood.\r\n\r\nA chapter on the geography of the Archipelago is presented first to\r\ngive a general idea of the geographical relations of the Archipelago\r\nof Sulu, the location of its various islands and settlements, and its\r\ncommercial resources. Special attention has been given to accurate\r\nspelling of names and the correct location of settlements and small\r\nislands. Unusual pains have been taken to get satisfactory maps of the\r\nArchipelago and Island of Sulu and sketches of the town of Jolo. These\r\nwill help the reader and add interest to the succeeding chapters.\r\n\r\nIn the Appendixes will be seen reprints of various documents, reports,\r\nquotations and letters of direct and significant bearing on the history\r\nof Sulu and Mindanao. They are arranged in chronological order and\r\nare intended to complete the record and description of important\r\nevents in Moro history so as to throw light on the actual conditions\r\nof life among the Moros, the political motives of the interested\r\npowers, and the real state of affairs in Mindanao at the time of the\r\nSpanish evacuation. The source from which each article is derived is\r\ngiven in connection therewith. A considerable number of quotations or\r\nchapters have been taken from \"The Philippine Islands,\" by Blair and\r\nRobertson, for which special obligation is hereby expressed. Many of\r\nthe official documents given could not be conveniently incorporated\r\nin the text of the history proper, and are herein published, probably\r\nfor the first time. They include protocols, capitulations, official\r\nletters, decrees, and correspondence relative to Sulu obtained from\r\nthe Division of Archives of the Philippine Islands. The originals of\r\nthe copies can be seen in Spain in the Indies Archives.\r\n\r\nSome liberty has been taken in correcting the spelling of geographical\r\nand other proper names in order to render the history uniform in\r\nits orthography and to avoid confusion and misconnection of events,\r\npersons, and places. The same system of orthography has been used here\r\nas that used and described in Part 1 of Volume IV, Ethnological Survey\r\nPublications. Diacritical signs to denote the long sounds of vowels\r\nhave, however, been very rarely used. The Arabic \"hamzat,\" occurring\r\nin Moro words has been expressed by an apostrophe; while an inverted\r\napostrophe has been used to represent the Arabic sound or character\r\n\"`ain,\" the eighteenth letter of the Arabic alphabet. Annotations\r\nwhich occur in the original documents have generally been indicated\r\nby letters, while those made by the author are denoted by figures.\r\n\r\n\r\nManila, January, 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE SULU ARCHIPELAGO [2]\r\n\r\n\r\nIN GENERAL\r\n\r\nThe Sulu Archipelago is a series of small volcanic islands which\r\nextends in a northeast and southwest direction between the meridians\r\nof 119° 10' and 122° 25' east, and the parallels of 4° 30' and 6°\r\n50' north. It forms a continuous chain of islands, islets, and coral\r\nreefs, which connects the peninsula of Zamboanga with the northeastern\r\nextremity of Borneo and separates the Sulu Sea from the Celebes Sea. It\r\nmarks the southern line of communication between the Philippine Islands\r\nand Borneo and is probably the chief route of former emigrations and\r\ntravel from Borneo to Mindanao and the southern Bisayan Islands.\r\n\r\nThe islands of the Archipelago are so disposed as to form several\r\nsmaller groups, the most important of which are the following: The\r\nBasilan Group, the Balangingi or Samal Group, the Sulu Group, the\r\nPangutaran Group, the Tapul or Siasi Group, and the Tawi-tawi Group.\r\n\r\nThe Basilan Group is the first on the north and includes the Island\r\nof Basilan and fifty-six small adjacent islands, all of which lie\r\nnorth of the parallel of 6° 15' north and east of the meridian of\r\n121° 19' east. This group, under the name of Basilan, constituted\r\nthe sixth district of the politico-military government of Mindanao,\r\norganized by the Spanish Government in 1861. Since that date the\r\nislands forming this group have not been recognized politically as\r\na part of the Sulu Archipelago.\r\n\r\nBasilan is the largest island in the Archipelago. Its northernmost\r\npoint is about 10 miles directly south of Zamboanga. The island is more\r\nor less circular in outline and has a radius approximately 11 miles\r\nlong. Its area is about 400 square miles. Two prominent headlands\r\nprojecting, one on the east and one on the west, give the island a\r\nmaximum length of 36 miles. The greatest width, north and south,\r\nis 24 miles. The eastern headland is long and has a picturesque,\r\nconical peak, called Mount Matangal, which rises about 648 meters\r\nabove sea level. This peak is a very prominent landmark, visible\r\nto a great distance from all points in the Celebes Sea and in the\r\nStraits of Basilan. The western headland is less prominent. It has\r\nan isolated peak about 287 meters above the sea, immediately north\r\nof the settlement of Pangasa'an. The position of this peak makes it a\r\nconspicuous landmark to vessels entering the Straits of Basilan from\r\nthe Sulu Sea.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the island is high and hilly. Twenty-three peaks\r\nare recognized, forming two distinct series or ranges, central and\r\nperipheral. The central region of the island is an elevated tableland,\r\nout of which rise a number of peaks forming the central series and\r\nranging from 609 to 1,019 meters above sea level. A thick forest covers\r\nthis region. The rivers are small and dry up in the dry season. Few\r\nYakans are to be found there, and their houses are isolated and far\r\napart. No cultivation is carried on in the interior. On the outside\r\nof this region rises the peripheral series of hills or peaks which\r\nlies parallel and near to the coast. With the exception of two,\r\nall of these peaks are below 304 meters in height. The drop from\r\nthis line of hills to the coast is rapid in some places, and in\r\ngeneral the shore line is low and swampy and covered with mangrove\r\ntrees. The three largest valleys in the island are those of Gubawan\r\nor Lamitan on the northeast, Kumalarang on the northwest, and Malusu\r\non the west. This region is generally considered fertile, but it has\r\na marked dry season and droughts are not rare.\r\n\r\nThe island is very rich in timber; all its hills and mountains are\r\nforest-clad to their summits. Excellent boats are constructed on the\r\nsouth and west coasts of the island which rival the Tawi-tawi boats\r\nin every particular. A few Americans have started hemp and coconut\r\nplantations on the north coast, but native cultivation is not extensive\r\nand compares very poorly with that of the Islands of Sulu, Tapul, and\r\nSiasi. Most of the cultivation on the island is carried on by Yakans,\r\nthe Samals living chiefly on the products of the sea. The staple\r\nproducts of the soil are rice, tapioca, and corn. Ubi (a kind of tuber\r\nused as food), camotes (sweet potatoes), and wild fruits abound. The\r\nnumber of cattle is not inconsiderable, but horses are few. Most of\r\nthe settlements on the island are on the sea coast and lie on the north\r\nand west coasts. The larger ones, beginning at Isabela and going east,\r\nare, on the north, Isabela, Patasan or Balaktasan, Malu'ung, Nipa,\r\nLamitan, Tagima, and Kandi'is; on the east, Tambunan, Buhi-lubung,\r\nand Ubung; on the south, Amalwi, Giyung, and Mangal; on the west,\r\nLibuk, Kabkaban, Kanas, Malusu, and Pangasa'an; on the north, Bulansa,\r\nAtung-atung, Batanay, and Panigayan. [3] The prominent chiefs of the\r\nisland live at Lamitan, Ubung, and Malusu, which form the principal\r\ncenters of native power. The old name of Basilan was Tagima, so called\r\nafter the name of the old settlement of Tagima mentioned above.\r\n\r\nIsabela may be considered as the capital of Basilan. Its old name is\r\nPasangan, which is still the name of the stream at the mouth of which\r\nit is built. The town is situated 4 miles inland, on the narrow channel\r\nwhich separates Basilan from the small island of Malamawi. The channel\r\nwidens a little at this point and forms an excellent harbor. Under\r\nSpanish jurisdiction it was a naval station with a dry dock for\r\ngunboats. An aqueduct furnishes the town with fresh water brought\r\nfrom a small stream in the neighborhood. The stone fort Isabel II,\r\nbuilt on the hill in 1842, commands both entrances of the channel. It\r\nwas designed to defend the town against the Moros. The abandonment\r\nof the town as a naval station has led to its present decline. An\r\nAmerican sawmill planted there has been the chief source of lumber\r\nsupply for the town of Zamboanga and neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe largest islands in this group, excepting Basilan, are Baluk-baluk\r\nand Pilas, both of which lie west of Basilan. A narrow channel which\r\nlies in the direct route leading from Zamboanga to Jolo separates\r\nthese two islands. Tapiantana, Salupin, Bubwan, and Lanawan are the\r\nlargest islands of the group south of Basilan.\r\n\r\nThe population of this whole group is generally estimated at 25,000. Of\r\nthese, 15,000 live in Basilan itself. The inhabitants of Basilan proper\r\nare Yakans and Samals, while the adjacent islands are occupied entirely\r\nby Samals. The Yakans are the aborigines of Basilan and extend farther\r\ninto the interior than the Samals.\r\n\r\nBasilan never enjoyed political independence. Before Spanish rule\r\nit was governed by Sulu datus and paid tribute to the Sultan of\r\nSulu. Under the datus, subordinate Samal panglimas [4] and maharajas\r\n[5] had charge of the various communities or settlements. The Samals\r\nof Basilan are at present stronger than other Samals and enjoy a\r\ngreater degree of liberty and self-government than their brothers in\r\nthe Tawi-tawi Group.\r\n\r\nThe Balangingi Group lies east of the meridian of 121° 28' east, and to\r\nthe south of the Basilan Group. It has nineteen islands, the principal\r\nones of which are Tonkil, Balangingi, Simisa, Tatalan, Bukutwa, Bulim,\r\nBangalaw. The islands of this group are small and low and do not exceed\r\n38 square miles in area. Their inhabitants are Samals. The people of\r\nBalangingi and Tonkil were notorious pirates. They built strong forts\r\nand once surpassed all other Samals in power, political organization,\r\nand prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe Sulu Group lies west of the Balangingi Group and north of the\r\nparallel of 5° 46' north. Its western boundary may be sent at the\r\nmeridian of 120° 46' east. It consists of about twenty-nine islands\r\nwith a total area of 380 square miles. The principal island of this\r\ngroup is Sulu. To the north of Sulu lie Pangasinan, Marongas, Kabukan,\r\nBubwan, Minis, Hegad, and a few others; to the east lie Tulayan,\r\nKapwal, and Bitinan; to the south, Pata and Patyan.\r\n\r\nTulayan lies north of Tandu and is separated from it by a narrow\r\nstrait. It has a good harbor on the southern side. It was ceded to the\r\nEnglish in 1763 by Sultan Alimud Din I out of appreciation of the favor\r\ndone in releasing him from prison in Manila and reinstating him as\r\nSultan of Sulu. The English, however, never made any use of the island.\r\n\r\nPata is, next to Sulu, the largest island of the group. It is\r\nmountainous and well populated. The description of the Island of Sulu\r\nis given separately at the end of this chapter.\r\n\r\nThe Pangutaran Group lies west of the Sulu Group and north of the sixth\r\nparallel. It has fourteen islands and an area of 72 square miles. The\r\nprincipal members of the group are Pangutaran, Pandukan, North Ubian,\r\nLaparan, and Tababas or Cap. They are all low and flat with little more\r\nthan trees visible from the sea. They are surrounded by coral reefs\r\nand sand banks, which in places form lagoons which can be entered only\r\nat high water. The drinking water in these islands is brackish in the\r\nhot season and has a black color during rains. Very often the people\r\ngo as far as the Island of Sulu to get good water. Pangutaran is the\r\nfifth island in the Archipelago in size, being 11 miles long, north\r\nand south, and 8 miles wide, from east to west. Its chief settlement is\r\nMaglakub. Its northern and eastern coasts are the best populated. The\r\ninhabitants of this group are chiefly Samals; few Sulus are found\r\nmixed with them. Coconut trees and tapioca plants grow well in places.\r\n\r\nThe Siasi Group lies to the south and west of the Sulu Group, east\r\nof the meridian of 120° 33' east, and north of the parallel of 5°\r\n24' north. It has thirty-eight islands with an aggregate area of 77\r\nsquare miles. Its population is estimated at 20,000. The principal\r\nislands of this group are Siasi, Pandami, Lugus, Tapul, Laminusa,\r\nand Kabinga'an. The first four are volcanic islands of some size;\r\nthe last two are low and flat. Tapul is the nearest island of the\r\ngroup to Sulu. It is more or less round in circumference and rises\r\nin the middle to a picturesque conical peak 505 meters above the\r\nsea. It is about 5 miles in diameter and is separated from Lugus by\r\na very narrow channel. The island is 8 miles south of Sulu Island,\r\nis well cultivated, and appears very attractive from the sea. It\r\nsupports a considerable population and has several fairly prosperous\r\nsettlements. The people are mostly Sulus; they are very warlike and\r\ntake great pride in their traditions.\r\n\r\nThe chief settlement of this island is Kanawi, where lives Sharif\r\nAlawi, the strongest chief on the island. Buhangin Hawpu, Pangpang, and\r\nPagatpat lie on the southern coast, east of Kanawi. The settlements on\r\nthe western coast are, beginning at the south, Suba Pukul, Kawimpang,\r\nTigbas, Banting, Kutabatu, Bagus; on the northern coast, Kawimpang,\r\nPangdan; on the eastern coast, Sampunay, Tulakan.\r\n\r\nLugus is a larger island. Its long diameter extends 9 miles east and\r\nwest, and it has an area of 18 square miles. It is hilly and rough;\r\nbut the northern shore is fairly well cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe chief settlements are on the western coast. They are Basbas,\r\nwhere Datu Amilusin used to live, and Bulipungpung. On the north lie,\r\nbeginning at the east, Gapas, Ba'it-ba'it, and Hawit, the place of\r\nMaharaja Sharafud Din; on the east Kalu'ukan, the residence of Panglima\r\nSalahud Din; and on the south Aluduyung, and the Island of Munupunu.\r\n\r\nSiasi and Pandami are separated by a narrow channel which forms a\r\ngood anchorage for vessels. Siasi is prettier than Tapul in form\r\nand is larger, but not equally wooded. It has an isolated, conical,\r\nand beautiful peak in the center rising to a height of 509 meters\r\nabove sea level. The island is about 7 miles in diameter and has an\r\narea of 39 square miles. Reefs and numerous islets form a fringe off\r\nthe east and south coasts and these teem with Samal houses. It is\r\nthickly settled, fairly well cultivated, and has, in proportion to\r\nits size, a considerable number of horses and cattle. The majority\r\nof the people are Samals, but the chief rulers and some of their\r\nretinues are Sulus. In this respect this island follows the general\r\nrule governing all the larger islands of the Archipelago outside of\r\nSulu Island. The town of Siasi is on the western side. It lies on the\r\nPandami Channel and has a good harbor. A spring rising at the base of\r\nthe western slope of the mountain supplies the town with fresh water.\r\n\r\nA detachment of Spanish troops occupied the town in 1882 and built\r\na stone fort and barracks. American troops were there from 1900 to\r\n1904, when they were relieved by a detachment of the Philippine\r\nConstabulary. An effort was made in 1899 by the present sultan,\r\nJamalul Kiram II, to retain Siasi under his own jurisdiction for\r\nthe establishment of a custom-house where he could collect duties\r\non foreign goods, as was formerly done by his father; but no such\r\nrights were conceded to him. Siasi is a closed port at present. The\r\nresidents of the town are Samals and Chinese traders. They vary from\r\n500 to 700 in number. The other settlements on the island are, on the\r\nnorth, Siyundu, Pagatpat, and Manta; on the east, Pamungunan, Tanjun,\r\nSipanding, and Bulikulul; on the south, Dugu, Latung, and Musu; on\r\nthe west, Nipanipa, Jambanganan, Dungus, and Sablay; in the interior,\r\nKabubu, Ju, and Kungatad. Siasi and Laminusa are important centers\r\nof pearl and shell fishing. About 2,000 Samals live on Laminusa.\r\n\r\nPandami is an attractive island. Its long diameter runs north\r\nand south. Two round peaks, one at each end of the island, give\r\nit the shape of a saddle and make a picturesque sight from the\r\nsea. The people are chiefly Samals ruled by Sulu datus. Its best\r\nsettlements are on the west and south. The name given to this island\r\non Spanish maps is Lapak, which is the name of one of its southern\r\nsettlements. The northern extremity of the island is Diadia Point,\r\nthe northeast projection is Butun Point. The chief settlements on\r\nthe west are, beginning at the north, Subasuba, Tabunan, Pari'an\r\nPandami, Tubig-shina, Lahi, and Sibawud, which lies on a reef off\r\nthe southern point of the island. On the east lie Ambilan, Bakal,\r\nand Lapak. Laminusa and Kabinga'an lie to the east of Siasi. They\r\nare small but thickly populated by Samals. The chief settlements of\r\nLaminusa are Tampan on the north and Kungkung on the south.\r\n\r\nThe Tawi-tawi Group lies to the south and west of the Tapul Group and\r\nextends as far west as the Sibutu Passage. This is the largest group\r\nin number and area, including eighty-eight islands with a combined\r\narea of 462 square miles. Its population is estimated at 25,000. These\r\nislands form two distinct divisions or subgroups, differing in both\r\nextent and population.\r\n\r\nThe first or northern division includes Bangao, Sangasanga, Tawi-tawi,\r\nTandu-batu, and a large number of smaller islands, all of which\r\nare rough, volcanic, mountainous, and very sparsely populated. The\r\nsecond or southern division is a series of low, flat islands which\r\nare smaller in area but more thickly populated than those of the\r\nnorthern division. The principal names, beginning at the east, are\r\nthe following: Kinapusan, Bintulan, Tabawan, South Ubian, Tandubas,\r\nSikubun, Lata'an, Mantabwan, Banaran, Bilatan, Manuk-manka, and\r\nSimunul. Extensive reefs and narrow channels and shoals separate these\r\nislands from one another and from those of the northern division,\r\nrendering navigation between them impossible except in vessels of\r\nvery light draft.\r\n\r\nBangao, Sanga-sanga, and Tawi-tawi are separated by very\r\nnarrow channels and are practically one island. Bangao forms the\r\nsouthwest extremity and is substantially one solid rock which rises\r\nperpendicularly to a height of 228 meters. It is a conspicuous landmark\r\nto vessels going through the Sibutu Passage. The town of Bangao is\r\na military station and an open port; it has an excellent landlocked\r\nharbor and a very poor water supply. The town has been occupied by\r\ntroops since 1882, but it has never attained any size or importance.\r\n\r\nTawi-tawi Island is a continuous range of hills covered by thick and\r\nrich forests. The highest points in the range are the Dromedary peaks\r\n(591 meters) lying about the center of the island. The length of the\r\nisland is about 34 miles and its greatest width 14 miles. It is next\r\nin size to the Island of Sulu, but it is very sparsely populated. Its\r\nchief settlements are Tungpatung, Balimbang, Lissum, and Bu'an on the\r\nsouth coast, and Tawi-tawi, Tata'an, Butung, Tumhubung, Tumbaga'an,\r\nLanguyan, and Bas on the north. At Balimbang are built the best types\r\nof Sulu and Samal boats. Good timber abounds in the neighboring hills,\r\nand the little bay is transformed into a shipyard. The town used\r\nto be a famous rendezvous for Samal pirates. Tata'an had formerly a\r\nSpanish garrison; the present Moro town is a little distance to the\r\nsouth of the ruins of the fort and is called Butung. It is built on\r\nthe hillside and commands a pretty view of the sea. It lies 100 miles\r\neast of Lahat Datu, East Borneo. The anchorage is deep and safe,\r\nbeing well protected by a large semicircle of reefs. A boa 30 feet\r\nlong was killed on the island in 1903. Rubber and gutta-percha are\r\nfound on this island. Tapioca and ubi are the staple products.\r\n\r\nSibutu lies in a little group of the same name, situated between\r\nthe Tawi-tawi Group and Borneo and at a distance of about 15 miles\r\nfrom each. The Sibutu Passage separates it from Manuk-manka, the\r\nsouthernmost island of the Tawi-tawi Group, and the Alice Channel from\r\nBorneo. This island did not lie within the limits of the Philippine\r\nIslands as defined in the Treaty of Peace of December 10, 1898. It was\r\nceded by Spain with Kagayan Sulu, by a separate treaty in November,\r\n1900. Its close proximity to Borneo renders it a convenient stopping\r\nplace for small Moro boats navigating between Borneo and Sulu. Sitanki,\r\nan island and town, is the trade center of this group, and has just\r\nlately been made an open port.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISLAND OF SULU\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES\r\n\r\nSulu is an island of irregular shape and among the islands of the\r\nArchipelago is next in size to Basilan. Its longest diameter runs east\r\nand west and approximates 37 miles, while its average length does not\r\nexceed 32 miles. Its greatest width is 14 miles and its average width\r\nabout 10 miles. The main structure of the island is volcanic, but it\r\nis surrounded with a coral reef formation, which is most extensive\r\nin the bays and on the south.\r\n\r\nTwo indentations of the northern shore at Jolo and Si'it and two\r\ncorresponding indentations of the southern shore at Maymbung and\r\nTu'tu', divide the island into three parts--western, middle, and\r\neastern.\r\n\r\nThe Bay of Jolo is quite open and faces the northwest. It is very\r\nshallow near the shore and its head constitutes the roadstead of\r\nJolo. The Bay of Maymbung is a deeper indentation, but it is narrower\r\nand shallower than the Bay of Jolo. The town of Maymbung lies at the\r\nhead of the bay and is about 9 miles south of Jolo in a direct line.\r\n\r\nThe Bays of Si'it and Tu'tu' indent the island to such an extent as\r\nto leave only a neck of land, less than 4 miles wide, connecting the\r\nmiddle and eastern parts of the island. The settlement of Si'it lies\r\nat the head of the bay and in the immediate vicinity of a small lake\r\nof the same name. The shores of the Bay of Tu'tu' are marshy and are\r\ncovered with mangrove trees. The bay is very shallow to a considerable\r\ndistance from shore. Tu'tu' is the principal settlement near the head\r\nof the bay.\r\n\r\nThe backbone of the island is a mountain range which runs east and\r\nwest and lies nearer to the northern shore. The highest point is Mount\r\nTumangtangis, at the western extremity of the range. This mountain\r\nreaches a height of 853 meters above sea level and descends very\r\nrapidly to the western coast near Timahu. A spur of the mountain\r\nterminates in Point Pugut at the northwestern extremity of the\r\nisland. [6]\r\n\r\nToward the east, the ridge descends to a much lower level at Bud Datu,\r\nBud Agad, and Bud Pula, which lie immediately to the south of Jolo. It\r\nrises again in Mount Dahu to an altitude of 716 meters. Mount Dahu is\r\na prominent landmark and forms the most picturesque landscape in the\r\nbackground of Jolo. It is a steep and conical extinct volcano, similar\r\nto, but smaller and more regular in form than Mount Tumangtangis. East\r\nof Mount Dahu is another gap in which lies Tambang Pass. Beyond this\r\nthe range rises again at Mount Tambang and continues uninterrupted to\r\nMount Sinuma'an, at the extreme end of Lati, and Mount Bagshag. After\r\nMount Bagshag the range descends gradually toward Su' and Si'it. The\r\nnorthern slopes of Mount Tumangtangis and Mount Dahu, and the crest of\r\nBud Datu are covered with grand forests, while the crests and lower\r\nslopes of Bud Agad and Bud Pula are partly cultivated and partly\r\ncovered with tall grass.\r\n\r\nFrom the shores of the Bay of Jolo the land rises gradually and\r\npresents a beautiful green appearance. The northern aspect of this\r\nwhole range and its beauty were appropriately described by Mr. Hunt,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There are few landscapes in the world that exhibit a more\r\n    delightful appearance than the seacoasts of Sulu; the luxuriant\r\n    variety of the enchanting hills exhibits a scenery hardly ever\r\n    equaled and certainly never surpassed by the pencil of the\r\n    artist. Some with majestic woods that wave their lofty heads\r\n    to the very summits; others with rich pasturage delightfully\r\n    verdant, with here and there patches burnt for cultivation,\r\n    which form an agreeable contrast with enameled meads; others,\r\n    again, exhibit cultivation to the mountain top, checkered with\r\n    groves affording a grateful variety to the eye--in a word, it\r\n    only requires the decorations of art and civilized life to form\r\n    a terrestrial paradise. [7]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the south of Bagshag [8] lies a small extinct volcano called Panamaw\r\nor Pandakan, whose crater is now a lake. East of Si'it rise the Lu'uk\r\nmountains of Urut, Upao, and Tayungan. From these the range extends\r\nto Bud Tandu at the eastern extremity of the island.\r\n\r\nThe highlands near the southern coast of the island divide into three\r\nseparate regions. The first and westernmost lies west of Maymbung\r\nand forms the principal highlands of Parang. The highest points in\r\nthis region are Mount Tukay, east of the town of Parang, and Mount\r\nMabingkang, east of Tukay. To the east of Maymbung rise Mount Talipao\r\nand Mount Kumaputkut, which form the middle and second region. The\r\nthird region is the southern part of the Lu'uk country. Its highest\r\npoint is Mount Bulag, to the north of Tandu-Panu'an.\r\n\r\nBetween Mount Tukay and Mount Tumangtangis lies Bud Gapang. Midway\r\nbetween Mount Talipao and Bud Datu is Mount Kumuray, in the\r\nneighborhood of Langhub.\r\n\r\nThe largest streams on the island are Tubig Palag and Bina'an. The\r\nfirst is generally known as the Maymbung River. It passes through\r\nthe settlement of Maymbung and empties into the head of the bay of\r\nthe same name. It drains the southern slopes of Mounts Tumangtangis,\r\nPula, Dahu, and Kumuray. The Bina'an stream drains the southern\r\nslopes of Mount Sinuma'an and the northern slopes of Mounts Talipao\r\nand Kumaputkut and empties into the Bay of Tu'tu'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL COAST SETTLEMENTS\r\n\r\nBeginning at Jolo and going west along the northern coast we pass\r\nthe following points of interest: The first is Point Baylam, the\r\nwestern limit of the Bay of Jolo. At the head of the small bay that\r\nfollows lies the settlement of Matanda, where a Spanish blockhouse\r\nmarks the western limit of the Jolo line of fortifications. Next\r\ncomes Point Mangalis and the receding beach of Bwansa, the old\r\ncapital of Sulu. Here and in the next bay, at Malimbay and Kansaya,\r\nSamal boats assemble in favorable weather for fishing. Back of these\r\nsettlements the land rises rapidly to Mount Tumangtangis. A teak\r\nforest of considerable size lies between Tumangtangis and Jolo.\r\n\r\nOutside of the wall of Jolo and to the east lies the settlement of\r\nBusbus, where criminals formerly were chopped to death after being tied\r\nto a tree. A mile beyond is Mubu, where the old residence of Sultan\r\nHarun stands out prominently. Copious springs of fresh water issue at\r\nthis place at a point near the high-water mark. A mile farther east we\r\ncome to Tandu (point or cape), where Datu Kalbi lives. This point is\r\ngenerally known as Tandu Dayang Ipil [9] and marks the eastern limit\r\nof the Bay of Jolo. The isolated hill of Patikul rises immediately\r\nbehind Tandu. The settlement of Patikul lies still farther away on\r\nthe beach. Here lives Datu Julkarnayn (Alexander the Great), the\r\nbrother of Datu Kalbi. The beautiful region lying between Patikul\r\nand the mountains of Tambang and Sinuma'an is called Lati.\r\n\r\nBuhanginan lies about midway between Patikul and Higasan. At the\r\nlatter place or Tandu Manuk-manuk the shore line recedes toward the\r\nsouth. Opposite this point lies the Island of Bakungan. Next comes\r\nthe larger settlement of Taglibi, above which rises Mount Ta'ung; then\r\nBunbun, near a point which marks the western entrance into the Bay of\r\nSi'it. Midway between Bunbun and the head of the bay is Su', which may\r\nbe said to mark the boundary line between Lati and Lu'uk. Si'it is\r\na small settlement near the head of the bay. Beyond Si'it the shore\r\nline turns north until it reaches Kansipat. About 2 miles farther, a\r\nsemicircular reef off the shore makes the excellent and well-protected\r\nsmall harbor of Bwal. A large spring of pure, fresh water adds to this\r\nplace another natural advantage, one which gave it the prominence it\r\nhad in former days. The entrance into the harbor is very shallow and\r\nallows only sailboats of light draft. The channel lies close to the\r\nshore on the west side. Opposite the Island of Tulayan lie Tandu-batu\r\nand a little farther inland Kuta Makis. Limawa lies about 3 miles\r\nfarther on near a point opposite the Island of Buli Kuting. Behind\r\nthis island and at the head of a shallow cove lies Patutul, the chief\r\nsettlement of Tandu. East of Bud Tandu is Tandu Pansan, the easternmost\r\npoint of the island. The eastern coast is exposed to storms and appears\r\nrocky and barren, though the hills behind it are well cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe first point on the southern coast is Tandu Panu'an, behind which\r\nlies the settlement of Sukuban. This marks the southern extremity of\r\nthe boundary line between Tandu and Lu'uk. The country behind Kuta\r\nSihi' and Pitugu appears rich and well tilled. The hills come down\r\nto the beach. Near the point at the eastern limit of Tu'tu' Bay lies\r\nKambing. The neighboring country is rich and prosperous. It is governed\r\nby Maharaja Bayrula, one of the wisest and best chiefs of Sulu. West\r\nof Kambing lie Pandang-pandang, Tubu-manuk, and Tu'tu'. The shore is\r\na continuous mangrove marsh, while the country behind is about the\r\nrichest and best tilled land on the whole island. The western side\r\nof Tu'tu' Bay has few places of importance. The country behind is\r\npicturesque and hilly, but not as well populated as other parts of\r\nthe island. Lubuk, Kabungkul, and Lumapit are the chief settlements.\r\n\r\nBeyond the point of Buhangin Puti', the shore line bends again north\r\nand the Bay of Maymbung begins. Here mangrove swamps are extensive and\r\nextend a good distance inland. The greater part of Maymbung is built on\r\npiles over the water. It is surrounded by swamps on all sides. After\r\nthe tide recedes, strong odors arise from the muddy bottom to such\r\nan extraordinary degree as to render the atmosphere of the place\r\nvery disagreeable and often unbearable to strangers. The center of\r\nthe town is a small, open square of reclaimed land filled with coral\r\nrocks. Around this square were built the houses of Sultan Jamalul\r\nA`lam and his ministers of state. The present sultan lives on a hill\r\nabout half a mile inland from the town. The square was probably the\r\nsite of the Maymbung fort which was destroyed by General Arolas in\r\n1887. Some Chinese traders live in the town and export hemp, pearls,\r\npearl shells, etc., through Jolo. The population of the town and its\r\nimmediate suburbs varies considerably, but it is generally estimated\r\nat 1,000. Beyond Maymbung the coast bends sharply to the south. In\r\nthe immediate vicinity of Maymbung lies Bwalu. A mile west of this\r\nplace begins the district of Parang. After Lipid and Lapa comes\r\nKabali'an, the western limit of the Bay of Maymbung. The shore line\r\nthen takes a more westerly direction. Passing Dandulit and Lakasan,\r\nwe reach Tandu Put, where the western coast of the island begins. This\r\nsouthern region of Parang is well populated and is very pretty and\r\nproductive. Cultivated areas are seen on the side of the mountains\r\neverywhere and they reach the very summit of Mount Tukay.\r\n\r\nThe town of Parang is one of the largest settlements on the island\r\nand has, at present, an estimated population of 1,000. It is situated\r\nat the head of a small open bay facing the southwest and commands\r\na beautiful view of Tapul and Lugus and the intervening sheet of\r\nwater. It is the capital of the district and has one of the best\r\nmarkets in the Archipelago for fish, shells, and pearls. The drinking\r\nwater in this neighborhood is brackish.\r\n\r\nAn islet lies off the shore near Tandu Bunga. Beyond this point the\r\nshore line turns north to Bwisan, which is one of the most prosperous\r\nsettlements in the district. Beyond Alu Pangku' the coast inclines a\r\nlittle east and runs to Silankan and Timahu. Extensive coconut groves\r\nand well-cultivated fields and fruit trees of various kinds abound\r\nall along the coast from Parang to Timahu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRICTS OF THE ISLAND\r\n\r\nThe districts of the island conform in a great measure to its natural\r\ndivisions. However, political reasons have modified the natural\r\nboundaries and increased the districts to six by division. These\r\ndistricts are Parang, Pansul, Lati, Gi'tung, Lu'uk and Tandu. The first\r\ndistrict on the west is Parang. A line joining the western limit of\r\nBwalu on the south coast, with a point slightly east of the summit of\r\nMount Tumantangis, and projected to the sea on the north, delimits\r\nthis district on the east and carves out of the western natural\r\ndivision the district of Pansul. The eastern boundary of Pansul is a\r\nline running from a point 2 or 3 miles east of Maymbung to Mount Pula\r\nand Busbus. The chief reason for separating Pansul from Parang was\r\nto reserve for the sultan direct control over Jolo and Maymbung. This\r\ndistrict has more foreigners residing in it than any other.\r\n\r\nA line joining Su' and Lubuk marks the eastern limit of both Lati and\r\nGi'tung, the third and fourth districts. The watershed line joining\r\nthe summits of Mounts Dahu, Tambang, and Sinuma'an and falling on\r\nthe east to the vicinity of Su', divides Lati on the north from\r\nGi'tung on the south. For all practical purposes the district of\r\nLati may be said to lie between Jolo and Su', and the district of\r\nGi'tung or Talipao between Maymbung and Tu'tu'. The land joining\r\nSi'it and Tu'tu' is low. Sulu traditions say that when the Samals\r\narrived in the island this neck of land was submerged and the island\r\nwas divided by a channel of water. The extinct volcano of Pandakan,\r\ngenerally spoken of as the \"Crater Lake,\" which lies in this vicinity,\r\nmay be of late origin and may have been the source of the geologic\r\ndeposits which helped to fill the channel. Spanish records speak of\r\na volcanic eruption in the vicinity of Jolo as late as 1840, and it\r\nis very likely that other volcanic action occurred prior to that date\r\nand after the arrival of the Samals in the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\nA line joining Limawa on the north and Sukuban or Tandu Panu'an on\r\nthe south, divides Lu'uk from Tandu, thus forming the fifth and sixth\r\ndistricts respectively. A line joining Mount Tayungan and Bud Tandu\r\ndivides both Lu'uk and Tandu into a northern and a southern part. In\r\nboth cases the southern parts are more fertile and better cultivated\r\nand probably more thickly populated than the northern.\r\n\r\nThe Sulus are principally agriculturists. The greater part of the\r\npeople are farmers and a considerable portion of the interior of the\r\nisland is under cultivation. They raise a good number of cattle,\r\ncarabaos, and horses, which they utilize for tilling the soil and\r\ntransporting its products. Trails cross the island in all directions\r\nand the interior is in easy communication with the sea. Fruits are\r\ngood and abundant. The forests are rich in jungle products and in\r\ntimber. Some copra and hemp is raised and the amount is being increased\r\nannually. The staples are tapioca, rice, and corn. Sugar cane is raised\r\nin small quantities. Ubi and taro are fairly abundant. Some coffee is\r\nproduced, but disease destroyed most of the plantations. Some tobacco\r\nand vegetables are raised for home consumption only.\r\n\r\nJolo is one of the best fish markets in the Philippine Islands. The\r\nvarieties of fish in Sulu waters are innumerable and of excellent\r\nquality. The Island of Sulu surpasses Mindanao in the quality and\r\nproportional amount of its fruit. There is an abundance of mangostins,\r\ndurians, nangkas (jack-fruit), lançones, [10] marangs, [10] mangos\r\nof several varieties (mampalam, bawnu, and wanni), oranges, custard\r\napples, pineapples, bananas, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the extent and quality of cultivation the district of Lu'uk\r\nranks first, Parang second, and Lati third. Good fresh water abounds\r\neverywhere except on the western coast. Considerable irrigation is\r\npossible in many localities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOWN OF JOLO.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL PLAN, BUILDINGS AND STREETS\r\n\r\nJolo is the Spanish representation (or rather misrepresentation) of\r\nthe word Sulu, sometimes written Sooloo. The early Spaniards wrote it\r\n\"Xolo,\" which later changed to Joló. The complete form of the word is\r\nSulug, as it is rendered in Magindanao. The Sulus pronounce it and\r\nwrite it Sug. Sug means a sea current. The flow of the tide through\r\nthe innumerable narrow channels separating the numerous islands of\r\nthe Archipelago gives rise to unusually strong currents which figure\r\nprominently in the seafaring life of the people. Therefore the term\r\nis an appropriate designation for the Archipelago as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe rulers of the island state have changed their capital four\r\ntimes. The most ancient capital was Maymbung, the second was Bwansa,\r\nwhich lies on the north coast of the island about 3 miles west of\r\nJolo. Here ruled Raja Baginda and the first three sultans of Sulu. The\r\nfourth sultan moved to Sug, the third capital, and the town remained\r\nthe capital of the sultanate until 1876, the date of the Spanish\r\nconquest and occupation. Sultan Jamalul A`lam then moved to Maymbung\r\nand the Spaniards occupied the town. Since then the term Jolo has\r\nbecome so intimately associated with it, that it is deemed preferable\r\nto use it as a name for the town, while the term Sulu, which is more\r\ncorrect and more commonly used, is retained in all other applications.\r\n\r\nThe town of Jolo has been so closely identified with the history\r\nof the sultanate as to claim considerable attention. The Spanish\r\nbuildings and improvements were sufficiently extensive to obscure\r\nthe ancient landmarks of the town and to render a complete and\r\nintelligent understanding of the early history and traditions of the\r\nplace impracticable. A few words describing the location of Jolo,\r\nits ancient landmarks, and the Spanish improvements will therefore\r\nbe of primary interest.\r\n\r\nThe town as it stands at present is divided into four distinct\r\nparts. The main or central part is Jolo proper or the \"walled\r\ntown.\" This is known to the Moros as Tiyangi Sug meaning the \"shops\r\nor market of Sulu.\" The western half of this part bordering on Suba'\r\nBawang formerly was termed Luway. The second part, called San Remondo,\r\nlies back and south of the walled town and is separated from it by a\r\nlittle stream called Tubig Hasa'an. The third part is Tulay and lies\r\non the west side; the fourth is Busbus, on the east side.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the roadstead separating the Pueblo nuevo or Tulay from\r\nJolo proper or Luway is a small tidal stream formerly called Suba'\r\nBawang. Some maps designate it as Rio del Sultan. This stream extends\r\nback into a swamp and divides into two branches. The main or direct\r\nbranch extends in a more or less southerly direction to a point about\r\n700 meters from the mouth of the stream, where it rises in copious\r\nsprings of fresh water at the edge of the swamp. The other branch\r\nis formed by the junction of the rivulet that rises in the springs\r\nof San Remondo with Tubig Hasa'an. The latter has its origin at the\r\nfoot of the hills above the cemetery and Blockhouse No. 2. Hasa'an\r\nmeans grindstone, and the springs are said to have burst out of the\r\nspot where a grindstone was set for use. Another stream, termed Suba'\r\nLigayan, drains the northern slopes of Buds Datu and Agad, and running\r\nnorth, passes by Fort Asturias and through Tulay, and empties into\r\nthe roadstead of Jolo at a point about 250 meters west of the mouth\r\nof Suba' Bawang. A branch of this stream formerly issued at Asturias\r\nand connected with the main stream of Suba' Bawang. The land which\r\nthus lay between Suba' Bawang and Suba' Ligayan was a delta. It was\r\ncalled by the Moros u-laya (that is, the head of the net) because\r\nof its triangular shape. It was mostly marshy, but it had a central\r\nlongitudinal strip of dry land which practically connected Tulay with\r\nthe base of the hills, at Asturias. At the upper end of this strip\r\nthere existed at one time a well-defined, sandy spot, different in\r\nformation from the surrounding land, which was considered sacred and\r\nwas supposed to be the first land formed on the island. This spot was\r\nSug proper; after it was named the whole settlement which was built\r\nalong the banks of Suba' Bawang and at the head of the roadstead.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan's palace, termed istana, his kuta (fort) and stockades\r\nwere built along the lower left bank of the stream Bawang; hence the\r\nname Rio del Sultan. On the right bank lay the houses and stockades\r\nof the other datus of high rank. Two bridges connected one side of\r\nthe stream with the other.\r\n\r\nOn the outskirts of the town lay various kuta belonging to subordinate\r\ndatus, which defended the approaches to the town. The most famous of\r\nthese kuta was Daniel's Fort, the best stronghold of Sulu. On the\r\nsite of this fort was built in 1878 the fort or redoubt of Alfonso\r\nXII, which was lately replaced by the present headquarters building\r\nof the military post of Jolo. Another strong fort was built at the\r\nfoot of the hills just above the head of the delta above described;\r\nit defended the inland approach to the town. This was Panglima Arabi's\r\nkuta, on the site of which Fort Asturias was erected. Another kuta\r\nwas located on Point Baylam.\r\n\r\nThe principal part of the town was formerly built over the shoal and\r\nbeach at the head of the bay. Extensive rows of buildings stretched\r\nout into the roadstead and in front of the buildings now occupied as\r\nthe clubhouse and military hospital. The present \"Chinese pier\" is\r\nconstructed on the same plan. This extensive row of houses and shops\r\nbegins at the lower point of the Tulay delta and stretches straight out\r\ninto the sea. The bay is very shallow here and appears to be fairly\r\nwell protected from severe storms. A variety of fish called tulay,\r\nafter which the Moro town of Tulay is named, is caught in the bay. A\r\nswamp bounds the town on the south and west, affording it considerable\r\nprotection from assault. However, it is open to attack from the sea\r\nand from the east. The land on the east is high and affords the only\r\ndesirable site for residences. Here the strongest forts and defenses\r\nwere erected.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards built the central part of Jolo first. They raised it\r\nconsiderably above sea level by extensive fillings, and surrounded it\r\nby a loop-holed wall, 8 feet high and 1 1/2 feet thick, for protection\r\nfrom Moro assaults. The new town was beautifully laid out with broad,\r\nclean streets lined with double rows of arbol de fuego (fire trees),\r\nylang-ylang, [11] acacia, and other varieties of trees, some of\r\nwhich are large and magnificent. Three parks, each one block in\r\nsize, added considerable picturesqueness to the place. Substantial\r\nquarters were built for the officers, all houses were painted white\r\nor whitewashed, and none of them had the nipa roofs so common in the\r\nArchipelago. Business places, storehouses, a large market place, a\r\nchurch, a theater, two schoolhouses, and a hospital were erected and\r\na public water supply provided. A stone pier was built extending 120\r\nmeters into the sea, and provided with a light-house at its outer end.\r\n\r\nThe town wall had five gates, two of which lay on the northwest or sea\r\nfront, one at the foot of the pier, and the other close to it. Through\r\nthe latter gate cargo was admitted from small boats, which can always\r\ncome up to this point at high water. The three other gates lay on the\r\nland side, one at the south end of the town toward Tulay, another at\r\nthe opposite extremity facing Busbus, and a third one at the southern\r\nend of Calle [12] Buyon, directly facing San Remondo. This last is the\r\nonly gate of the three kept open at present and is the only entrance\r\ninto the town from the land side. A tower called Torre de la Farola\r\nsurmounts the gate. Near the Busbus gate and forming the northeast\r\nangle of the town was the fort or redoubt termed Alfonso XII. It was\r\nbuilt on a prominent eminence and commanded an extensive view of the\r\nbay, the town, and the surrounding country.\r\n\r\nIn the immediate vicinity lay the Cuartel España, which was a large\r\nand substantial building occupying the northern extremity of the\r\ntown, facing the bay on the side of Busbus. At the extreme end of\r\nthe wall beyond the barracks was the tower or blockhouse called Torre\r\nNorte. Another similar tower at the south gate was termed Torre Sur. At\r\nthe intersection of the south wall and the beach line was a strong\r\nbuilding called Cuartel Defensivo de las Victorias. The block lying\r\ndiagonally between this cuartel and the market had eight buildings\r\nwhich were known as Casas de la Colonia para Deportados.\r\n\r\nTwo roads and two bridges connected the south and southeast gates\r\nwith San Remondo. The continuation of these roads formed the two\r\nmain streets of this part of the town. San Remondo has six small town\r\nblocks, nearly all of which are on reclaimed swamp land. The buildings\r\nhere are mere nipa huts and the streets are muddy and narrow, unlike\r\nthose of the walled town. Back of the town lies a large coconut grove\r\nwhich extends to Blockhouse No. 2 on one side and Asturias on the\r\nother. A straight and well laid out road directly connects these two\r\nlatter points and marks the southern limit of the town.\r\n\r\nA good road runs outside the wall connecting Busbus and Tulay. Later\r\nusage has applied the term Tulay to all parts of the town lying west\r\nof Suba' Bawang. Formerly the name Tulay was applied only to that\r\npart lying west of Suba' Ligayan, while the intermediate section was\r\nknown as Pueblo nuevo. The bridge across the mouth of Suba' Bawang was\r\ntermed puente del sultan. On the other side of the bridge this street\r\nextends through Pueblo nuevo and along the central strip of u-laya,\r\nor the delta, to Fort Asturias, thus separating the waters of Suba'\r\nBawang from Suba' Ligayan. Midway between Tulay and Asturias stands an\r\nobelisk-like monument erected by General Arolas and bearing the date\r\n1892. Further fillings in Tulay have provided for several streets,\r\nthe chief one of which is the direct street running to the Chinese\r\npier and then on to the blockhouse of the playa [13] and the Ligayan\r\nRiver. A large bridge crosses this river to Tulay proper. The road\r\nends at the beach a little beyond the bridge. In the central plaza at\r\nTulay stands a monument erected by General Arolas in 1891 in memory of\r\nthe three renowned conquerors of Jolo. On one side the monument bears\r\nthe inscription \"A la gloria de los que con su esfuerzo hicieron esta\r\ntierra Española;\" the second side bears the inscription \"Corcuera,\r\n17 de Abril de 1638;\" the third side, \"Urbistondo, 28 de Febrero\r\nde 1851;\" the fourth side, \"Malcampo, 29 de Febrero de 1876.\" A\r\nstraight road about three-fourths of a mile long called the Asturias\r\nRoad directly connects Asturias with the main entrance of the walled\r\ntown. Another road starts at this latter point and running along the\r\nright bank of Tubig Hasa'an reaches the cemetery on the opposite side\r\nof Blockhouse No. 2. The old bridge connecting a branch of this road\r\nwith the one running from Asturias to Blockhouse No. 2 was washed\r\naway by a severe freshet in 1904, thus breaking what had formerly\r\nbeen a complete circle of roads around the town.\r\n\r\nBusbus is wholly occupied by Moros. Its houses are dilapidated\r\nnipa huts built on piles over the water. Back of the town is a\r\nmarsh which extends a little way toward the base of the hills. The\r\nwater from the marsh escapes into the bay by two rivulets, the first\r\nof which runs through the settlement and is known as Tubig Uhang;\r\nthe other is artificial, forms the outer limit of the town, and is\r\ncalled Buyung Canal. Persons convicted of capital crimes in the days\r\nof the independent sultanate were tied to a tree at this place and\r\nthere their bodies were chopped to pieces; hence the name \"Busbus\"\r\nwhich means to \"chop up\" or \"dress wood.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRADE\r\n\r\nJolo lies about 4 miles from the point of intersection of latitude 6°\r\nnorth and longitude 121° east. It is about 540 nautical miles due\r\nsouth from Manila and 81 nautical miles distant from Zamboanga. The\r\nharbor is deep and free from currents. The bay is well protected on\r\nthe north by the Islands of Pangasinan and Marongas and is safe from\r\nall storms except those from the northwest.\r\n\r\nSulu occupies the most nearly central position of any island in eastern\r\nMalaysia. It lies between Mindanao on the east and Borneo on the\r\nwest, and separates the Sulu Sea from the Celebes Sea. The commercial\r\nadvantages of this position are unique. To the north lie the Bisayas,\r\nPalawan, Luzon, Formosa, China, and Japan; to the east Mindanao and\r\nBasilan; to the south, the Moluccas, Celebes, and Java; to the west,\r\nBorneo, Sumatra, and the Malay Peninsula. Besides, the Sulus are\r\nnatural-born sailors, and their famous pearl industry has prompted\r\nthem to trade since time immemorial. Their boats brought silk, amber,\r\nsilver, scented woods, and porcelain from China and Japan; gold dust,\r\nwax, dyes, saltpeter, slaves, and food stuffs from Luzon, the Bisayas,\r\nand Mindanao; gunpowder, cannon, brass, copper, iron, rubies, and\r\ndiamonds from Malacca and Bruney; [14] pepper and spices from Java,\r\nthe Moluccas, and Celebes. Chinese merchants traded with Sulu long\r\nbefore the arrival of Legaspi, and while Manila and Cebu were still\r\nsmall and insignificant settlements Jolo had reached the proportions of\r\na city and was, without exception, the richest and foremost settlement\r\nin the Philippine Islands. Jolo, with the exception of Bruney, had\r\nno rival in northeast Malaysia prior to the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nSuch commercial importance naturally attracted the attention of\r\nthe early Spanish Governors-General and was one of the causes which\r\nled to the early invasion of Sulu. The long period of warfare which\r\nfollowed this invasion retarded the progress of Jolo and reduced its\r\ntrade. Again, the rise of Spanish commerce in the north tended to\r\nrestrict the trade of Jolo. The growth of Manila, Cebu, and Iloilo\r\nnaturally diverted the commerce of Luzon and the Bisayas and the north\r\ncoast of Mindanao to those cities. The later commercial decline of\r\nJolo was probably brought about more in this way than as a result of\r\nactual clash of arms. Jolo, however, remained an important port and\r\na transshipping station to Mindanao until a late date.\r\n\r\nAt present trade has assumed new proportions and is following new\r\nroutes. Zamboanga, Kotabato, and Davao are directly connected with\r\nManila by regular steamship lines, and Jolo is fast losing its\r\nimportance as a transshipping port. Zamboanga, on the other hand,\r\nis rising in importance and seems destined to become the port of\r\nMindanao. It is the capital of the Moro Province and lies in the\r\ndirect route connecting China, Manila, and Australia. It has direct\r\ncommunication with Manila, Hongkong, Singapore, and Australia, and\r\nis gradually diverting the trade of Mindanao from Jolo.\r\n\r\nIn spite of overwhelming odds, however, Jolo will maintain considerable\r\ncommercial importance. It has well-established trade relations with\r\nBorneo, the Malay Peninsula, China, and Luzon, and is connected\r\nby regular steamship lines with Sandakan, Singapore, Manila, and\r\nZamboanga. Practically the whole trade of the Sulu Archipelago passes\r\nthrough this port, and it stands now, as ever before, as the center\r\nof business, power, and importance of the whole district of Sulu.\r\n\r\nIn the early days the trade of Sulu was carried on by Moros and\r\nChinese. The Chinese appear to have entered the Archipelago prior\r\nto its mohammedanization, and the commercial relations of China\r\nand Sulu are really prehistoric. As hostilities between Spain and\r\nSulu increased, Sulu traders became less daring and grew fewer and\r\nfewer. Chinese traders, on the other hand, were less molested and\r\nconditions encouraged their increase. The \"Chinese pier\" is a very\r\nold business establishment, and Chinese traders and merchants have\r\nresided in Jolo for many generations. Their number, in 1851, exceeded\r\n500. At present Chinese merchants have complete control of the trade\r\nof the Sulu Archipelago. They are found everywhere and command all the\r\navenues of commerce. The Sulus have abandoned commerce as a trade and\r\napparently have no inclination to resume it on any large scale. This\r\nis due mainly to the decline of their power and the present abeyance\r\nof their national life. A new political revival will no doubt change\r\ntheir attitude and may bring about a surprising development in arts\r\nand trades as well as of commerce.\r\n\r\nThe trade between Jolo and various islands and settlements of the\r\nArchipelago is carried on by means of innumerable small Moro boats and\r\nsloops termed sapits. Formerly such boats traded with Bruney, Sandakan,\r\nthe Celebes, Java, and all the various islands of the Philippine\r\nArchipelago, but the stricter enforcement of the customs regulations,\r\nwhich followed the establishment of open ports at Sitanki, Bangao, and\r\nKagayan Sulu, had the effect of checking trade with foreign countries\r\nin such small boats and tended to concentrate the whole trade of the\r\nArchipelago at Jolo. A review of the imports and exports of the port of\r\nJolo will therefore throw considerable light on the material resources\r\nof the Archipelago, its industries, and the enterprise of the natives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPort of Jolo\r\n\r\nIMPORTS\r\n\r\n====================================================================\r\n|                                          |     Fiscal year--     |\r\n|                Commodity                 |-----------------------|\r\n|                                          |   1905    |   1906    |\r\n|------------------------------------------|-----------+-----------|\r\n| Animals, etc                             |      $214 |       $71 |\r\n| Brass, manufactures of                   |     6,402 |     2,548 |\r\n| Breadstuffs                              |     4,881 |     3,870 |\r\n| Cement                                   |       745 |       989 |\r\n| Coal                                     |     4,208 |           |\r\n| Coffee                                   |       621 |       872 |\r\n| Cotton cloths, close woven               |    82,999 |    80,381 |\r\n| Cotton cloths, loose woven               |    14,053 |    14,338 |\r\n| Carpets                                  |     5,379 |           |\r\n| Yarn and thread                          |    18,059 |    19,594 |\r\n| Knit fabrics                             |     2,688 |     3,564 |\r\n| Cotton cloths, all other manufactures of |       949 |     2,079 |\r\n| Dyes                                     |     2,691 |     3,807 |\r\n| Opium                                    |    14,578 |     6,601 |\r\n| Earthen and stone ware                   |     1,494 |     2,419 |\r\n| Fibers, vegetable                        |       308 |       153 |\r\n| Dried fish                               |       216 |       456 |\r\n| Shell fish                               |       375 |       497 |\r\n| Fruits, canned                           |       272 |       254 |\r\n| Fruits, not canned                       |       362 |       407 |\r\n| Glass and glassware                      |       694 |       415 |\r\n| Iron, steel, and manufactures of         |     3,640 |     2,916 |\r\n| Malt liquors                             |     2,020 |       822 |\r\n| Matches                                  |       956 |       372 |\r\n| Mineral oils                             |       742 |     1,339 |\r\n| Vegetable oils                           |       536 |       503 |\r\n| Paints                                   |       979 |       299 |\r\n| Paper and manufactures of                |     2,123 |     1,816 |\r\n| Condensed milk                           |     1,516 |     1,363 |\r\n| Rice                                     |    76,172 |    57,416 |\r\n| Silk and manufactures of                 |     1,614 |     1,318 |\r\n| Soap                                     |       724 |       610 |\r\n| Spirits, distilled                       |     1,643 |     1,108 |\r\n| Sugar, refined                           |     4,314 |     2,987 |\r\n| Tea                                      |       646 |       489 |\r\n| Tobacco and manufactures of              |       586 |       367 |\r\n| Vegetables                               |     1,204 |     1,919 |\r\n| Wearing apparel                          |           |     3,699 |\r\n| Wood and manufactures of                 |     2,270 |     1,646 |\r\n| Wool and manufactures of                 |     2,282 |       206 |\r\n| All others                               |     8,126 |     7,262 |\r\n|                                          |-----------+-----------|\r\n|     Total in U.

B. Cook, collector of customs for Jolo. They\r\nrepresent the total value of the imports and exports of the town to\r\nand from foreign ports only. They do not, however, give an idea of the\r\ngrand total of the imports and exports of the Archipelago. Account\r\nmust also be taken of the large amount of commodities smuggled into\r\nthe country by means of small boats which continually run between\r\nthe Tawi-tawi Group and Kagayan Sulu on the one side and Borneo and\r\nPalawan on the other. Moreover, it is difficult to tell what part of\r\nthe trade of Basilan and the Samal group of islands is retained by Jolo\r\nand what part has lately been drawn away by Zamboanga. Besides, some\r\ntrade between Sulu and Basilan, on one side, and Mindanao, Negros,\r\nand Cebu on the other, is carried on by sailing craft; no account\r\nof this is taken either at Jolo or Zamboanga. Since July 1, 1905,\r\nall boats under 15 tons register have not been required to present at\r\nthe custom-house manifests of goods carried. It is clear, therefore,\r\nthat no correct estimate or opinion can be rendered on the strength\r\nof these figures, unless one is aided by personal observation and\r\nknowledge of actual conditions previous to July 1, 1903.\r\n\r\nEstimating the population affected by the trade of Jolo, at 100,000,\r\nwe note that the importation of cloths and woven materials amounted\r\nto P204,431 in 1905 and P196,836 in 1906, or 37 per cent and 42\r\nper cent of total imports, respectively. There is no doubt that the\r\nweaving industry among Sulus and Samals is far from being adequate to\r\nfurnish clothing material, and European cotton cloths are therefore\r\nextensively used throughout the Archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe importation of rice amounted to P152,344 in 1905 and P114,832 in\r\n1906, or 27 and 24 per cent of the total imports, respectively. The\r\nSulus are agriculturists and should be able to raise sufficient rice\r\nfor themselves and the Samals. The islands most fitted for this\r\npurpose are Sulu, Basilan, Tapul, Siasi, Pata, and Pandami. The\r\nSamals are not agriculturists as a rule and seldom raise anything\r\nexcept tapioca and corn. They generally live on flat, low islands,\r\nunfit for the cultivation of rice. The Archipelago as a whole should\r\nproduce sufficient rice, tapioca, corn, and camotes to feed the whole\r\npopulation. The importation of rice in 1905 was probably in excess\r\nof the average amount; less rice was raised that year because of war\r\nand general disturbances.\r\n\r\nThe commodities of next importance are yarn and thread for weaving\r\npurposes. Importation of these articles amounted to P36,118 in 1905\r\nand P39,188 in 1906, or 7 and 8 per cent, respectively. The country\r\ndoes not produce silk, cotton, or wool.\r\n\r\nAll other imports may be regarded as accessories. Of these opium\r\ncomes first, then dyes, breadstuffs, sugar, iron, steel, brass, paper,\r\nand earthenware. A considerable amount of tobacco is imported by the\r\ngovernment free of duty, and quantities of tobacco, opium, and cloths\r\nformerly were smuggled in. The reduction of imports in 1906 may be\r\ndue to increased production, to the depression that followed the\r\ndisturbances of 1904 and 1905, and to a diversion of certain parts\r\nof the trade to Zamboanga.\r\n\r\nThe exports, on the other hand, show a light increase in 1906. They\r\ndistinctly represent those resources of the country which are most\r\ncapable of development. At the head of the list stands the shell\r\nindustry, particularly the pearl shell, which amounted to P189,472 in\r\n1905 and P149,542 in 1906, or 64 and 52 per cent of total exports,\r\nrespectively. The exportation of shell has lately been greatly\r\naffected by the falling of the price of pearl shell in the market of\r\nSingapore. The exportation of other shells seems, on the contrary,\r\nto have increased. Pearl fishing is the principal industry of the\r\ncountry and forms the main source of its riches. The fishing is done\r\nexclusively by natives, but the trade seems to be wholly in the hands\r\nof Chinese. The figures given above do not include pearls. It is\r\nvery difficult to obtain any statistics for this valuable product,\r\nbut on the whole it is reckoned by merchants as equivalent to the\r\nwhole output of shell.\r\n\r\nSecond in importance comes copra, which amounted to P35,740 in\r\n1905 and P60,104 in 1906, or 12 and 21 per cent of total exports,\r\nrespectively. The marked increase of this export in 1906 may\r\nbe explained partly by increased production and partly by the\r\ngeneral damage done to the trees in 1905 by locusts. Increase in the\r\ncultivation of coconut trees is not perceptible and can not account\r\nfor the increase in exportation.\r\n\r\nDried fish comes third in order, amounting to P15,786 in 1905\r\nand P26,302 in 1906. This industry is capable of unlimited\r\ndevelopment. The fertility of the Sulu Sea is unusual and can hardly\r\nbe surpassed. Nothing but enterprise and organized effort is needed\r\nto render this trade a source of enormous wealth to the country. The\r\nnatives are exceedingly skillful in fishing, but lack ambition and\r\ninitiative. The trade in fish is mostly in the hands of Chinese\r\nmerchants.\r\n\r\nFourth in importance comes hemp. Both in fiber and cordage its exports\r\namounted to P11,140 in 1905 and P21,230 in 1906. Hemp culture has\r\nmarkedly improved during the last year, and the increased production\r\nis sufficient to explain the increase in exportation. Coconut trees\r\nand hemp grow splendidly on all the larger islands of the Archipelago,\r\nand their cultivation is capable of extensive development.\r\n\r\nCopal and gutta-percha are the products of Sulu, Basilan, and the\r\nTawi-tawi Islands. Although sufficiently important in themselves,\r\nthey sink into insignificance when compared with the four primary\r\nstaple products and the immense possibilities that lie in the line\r\nof their development.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the trade of Jolo is handled by the Jolo Trading\r\nCompany, the firm of Hernandez & Co., and the commercial houses of\r\nChaun Lee and Ban Guan, all of which are controlled and managed by\r\nChinese merchants. The following list compiled in the office of the\r\nJolo Trading Company, for the Far Eastern Review, is a fair estimate\r\nof the prospective exports of the town for the coming two years:\r\n\r\n\r\n===================================================================\r\n|                 Article         |  Amount   | Price |   Total   |\r\n|---------------------------------+-----------+-------+-----------|\r\n|                                 |  Piculs.  |       |           |\r\n| Hemp                            | 1,000     |   P21 |   P21,000 |\r\n| Pearl shells                    |   150     |    45 |     6,750 |\r\n| Trepang or beche-de-mar         |    50     |    30 |     1,500 |\r\n| Shark fins                      |    20     |    45 |       900 |\r\n| Hemp rope                       |    30     |    25 |       750 |\r\n| Caracoles (sea shells           |           |       |           |\r\n| for buttons, etc.)              |    40     |    12 |       480 |\r\n| Black shells                    |    10     |     8 |        80 |\r\n| Copra                           |   500     |     7 |     3,500 |\r\n| Seaweeds                        |    40     |     4 |       160 |\r\n| Hides                           |    10     |    20 |       200 |\r\n| Cacao                           |    10     |    50 |       500 |\r\n| Tortoise shells                 |     1-1/2 | 1,800 |     2,700 |\r\n| Sea horses                      |           |       |       240 |\r\n|---------------------------------+-----------+-------+-----------|\r\n|       Grand total               |           |       |    38,760 |\r\n|=================================================================|\r\n\r\n\r\nHemp is generally exported to Manila, while the other articles\r\nmentioned in the above table are generally exported to Singapore.\r\n\r\nTrepang, shark fins, seaweed, and sea horses are foods highly prized\r\nby the Chinese.\r\n\r\nIf the value of pearls taken is estimated on the basis suggested by\r\nthe president of the Jolo Trading Company, it will bring the total\r\nup to P58,760 per month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPULATION\r\n\r\nThe present population of Jolo is less than 2,000. This includes\r\nall the natives and foreigners living in Tulay and Busbus; but the\r\nUnited States troops are excepted. The bulk of the inhabitants is\r\nmade up of Filipinos, Chinese, and Moros.

The Chinese element may therefore be classified as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n        =======================================\r\n        |  Chinese  | Males | Females | Total |\r\n        |-----------+-------+---------+-------|\r\n        | Pure      |   429 |      56 |   485 |\r\n        | Mixed     |    70 |      45 |   115 |\r\n        |           |-------+---------+-------|\r\n        |     Total |   499 |     101 |   600 |\r\n        =======================================\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Filipinos may be classified as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n        =======================================\r\n        | Filipinos | Males | Females | Total |\r\n        |-----------+-------+---------+-------|\r\n        | Brown     |   274 |     202 |   476 |\r\n        | Mixed     |     4 |       3 |     7 |\r\n        |           |-------+---------+-------|\r\n        |     Total |   278 |     205 |   483 |\r\n        =======================================\r\n\r\n\r\nThe census statistics give a full and clear idea of the composition\r\nof the resident population of the town in 1903. The Chinese and\r\ntheir offspring, amounting to 600, undoubtedly form the preponderant\r\nelement. The Filipinos come next, amounting to 483 only. Considerable\r\nchange has, however, occurred since the census was taken, and\r\nnecessitates a revision of the above figures. The increase of the\r\ngarrison and the construction of many new buildings for the military\r\npost has caused an influx of Filipinos from Zamboanga and Kotabato,\r\nand more Chinese have undoubtedly come in since 1903. The census\r\nfigures again do not include Moros, some hundreds of whom live at\r\npresent in Tulay and Busbus.\r\n\r\nThe following, based on close personal observation, is considered a\r\nfair estimate of the present population:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ==============================================================\r\n    |           |  Walled | San Remondo | Tulay | Busbus |  Jolo |\r\n    |           |    town |             |       |        |       |\r\n    |-----------+---------+-------------+-------+--------+-------|\r\n    | Moros     | [17] 30 |          30 |   300 |    350 |   710 |\r\n    | Chinese   |     250 |          10 |   400 |     20 |   680 |\r\n    | Filipinos |     170 |         100 |   250 |        |   520 |\r\n    |           |---------+-------------+-------+--------+-------|\r\n    |     Total |     450 |         140 |   950 |    370 | 1,910 |\r\n    ==============================================================\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the town are more or less migratory\r\nin character. The population is constantly changing. Few are\r\nproperty owners. The majority are traders, carpenters, and domestic\r\nservants. The Filipinos were originally \"camp followers\" and still\r\nfeel as strangers in the land. Many of the Moros living at Tulay\r\nand Busbus are of mixed origin. The mixture is chiefly of Sulus and\r\nSamals, with each other and with Chinese. The Jolo type of Moros is\r\nby no means pure Sulu and has consequently misled many authors and\r\nethnologists. A large number of Samals frequent Tulay and Busbus and\r\noften temporarily reside there, but because of their strong migratory\r\nhabits no estimate has been made of them.\r\n\r\nA few Arabians, Malays, and Indian traders are married in the country,\r\nbut their proportion is small and insignificant at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nGENEALOGY OF SULU\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe manuscript of which a translation follows is an exact copy of\r\nthe original, which is in the possession of Hadji Butu Abdul Baqi,\r\nthe prime minister of the Sultan of Sulu. The genealogy proper begins\r\non page 6 of the manuscript and is written entirely in Malay. This\r\nwas the rule among all old Moro writers and is a decided indication\r\nof the authenticity of the document.\r\n\r\nHadji Butu maintains that his ancestry goes back to Mantiri [18]\r\nAsip, one of the ministers of Raja Baginda, the Sumatra prince who\r\nemigrated to Sulu prior to the establishment of Mohammedanism in the\r\nisland. The Sulu ministry seems to have remained in Asip's lineage\r\ndown to the present time.\r\n\r\nThe first five pages of the original manuscript are the genealogy of\r\nAsip's descendants. This part is written in Sulu and was probably\r\ncomposed at a later period than the Malay part of the book. It is\r\nwritten by Utu Abdur Rakman, the nephew of Imam Halipa, who is the\r\nson of Nakib Adak, the last person mentioned in the genealogy. Abdur\r\nRakman is a cousin of Hadji Butu.\r\n\r\nThe addition of these five pages to the Genealogy of Sulu is for the\r\npurpose of giving prominence and recognition to the sons of Asip,\r\nwho have been the right-hand men of the Sultans of Sulu since the\r\norganization of the sultanate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSULU AUTHOR'S INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThis is the genealogy of the sultans and their descendants, who lived\r\nin the land of Sulu.\r\n\r\nThe writing of this book was finished at 8 o'clock, Friday the 28th\r\nof Thul-Qa`idat, [19] 1285 A. H.\r\n\r\nIt belongs to Utu [20] Abdur Rakman, [21] the son of Abu Bakr. It\r\nwas given to him by his uncle Tuan [22] Imam [23] Halipa [24]\r\nAbdur Rakman. This is the genealogy of the Sulu sultans and their\r\ndescendants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCENDANTS OF ASIP\r\n\r\nThis is the genealogy of Mantiri [25] Asip, the hero and learned man of\r\nMenangkabaw. [26] Mantiri Asip had the title of Orangkaya [27] at the\r\ntime he came to Sulu with Raja [28] Baginda. [29] He married a woman\r\nfrom Purul [30] called Sandayli and begot Orangkaya Sumandak. Sumandak\r\nbegot Orangkaya Manuk [31] and Orangkaya Hamba. [32] Manuk begot\r\nOrangkaya Buddiman [33] and Orangkaya Akal [34] and Orangkaya Layu\r\nand Satya [35] Akum. His daughters were Santan, Satan, Ambang, Duwi,\r\nSitti, [36] and Tamwan. Orangkaya Buddiman begot Orangkaya Salimin [37]\r\nand Dayang [38] Saliha. [39] The former begot Hinda Da'ar Maputra and\r\nUtu Undik, Dayang [40] Patima, [41] Dayang Bahira, [42] and Dayang\r\nSawira. Dayang Saliha bore Idda. Akal begot Orangkaya Muhaddi, who\r\nbegot Hinda Human. Orangkaya Layu begot Dayang Jawsul [43]-Manalum,\r\nwho became famous. Manalum bore Ma'asum, Bulaying and Jamila. [44]\r\nJamila bore Itang. Ma'asum begot Bayi. Bulayin begot Inda and Duwalang.\r\n\r\nJawsul begot Na'ika and Rajiya. [45] The former begot Orangkaya\r\nSila. Rajiya bore Tuan Aminud [46] Din. [47] Santan bore Ma'mun. [48]\r\nMa'mun begot Orangkayas Utung and Amang. Satan bore Palas and\r\nBahatul. Bahatul begot Abdul Hadi. [49] Ambang bore Orankayas\r\nAmin and Bunga. [50] Orangkaya Amin begot Rajiya and Zakiya. [51]\r\nZakiya is the mother of Orangkaya Sila. Rajiya is the mother of Tuan\r\nAminud-Din. Bunga begot Aliya and Salima. [52] Salima bore Hinda\r\nBaying Gumantung.\r\n\r\nDuwi bore Manduli and Immang. Manduli is the mother of Tuan Iman Anda\r\nand Na'ima. [53] Immang bore Mali. Sitti bore Orangkayas Ugu, Garu,\r\nAbu Bakr, Abu Samma, Manawun, Sayda, and Suda. Allak begot Ila and\r\nMalum. [54] Ila bore Andungayi. Malum is the father of Imming. Tamwan\r\nbore Ima. Ima begot Angkala. Angkala begot Inung. Inung begot Hinda\r\nNakib [55] Adak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCENDANTS OF TUAN MASHA'IKA\r\n\r\nThis is the genealogy of Tuan Masha'ika. It was said by the men\r\nof old that he was a prophet who was not descended from Adam. He\r\nwas born out of a bamboo and was esteemed and respected by all the\r\npeople. The people were ignorant and simple-minded in those days and\r\nwere not Mohammedans of the Sunni sect. Some of them worshiped tombs,\r\nand some worshiped stones of various kinds.\r\n\r\nMasha'ika married the daughter of Raja Sipad the Younger, who was a\r\ndescendant of Sipad the Older. His wife's name was Idda [56] Indira\r\n[57] Suga. [58] She bore three children, Tuan Hakim, [59] Tuan Pam,\r\nand 'Aisha. [60] Tuan Hakim begot Tuan Da'im, [61] Tuan Buda, Tuan\r\nBujang, Tuan Muku, and a girl. Da'im begot Saykaba. Saykaba begot\r\nAngkan. Angkan begot Kamalud [62] Din, and Katib [63] Mu`allam [64]\r\nApipud [65] Din, and Pakrud [66] Din, and many girls.\r\n\r\nTuan May begot Datu Tka, who was surnamed Dina, Lama and Timwan. Dina\r\nbegot Abi [67] Abdul Wakid [68] and Maryam. [69]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL AND LATER SETTLERS OF SULU\r\n\r\nThis chapter treats of the original inhabitants of the Island of\r\nSulu. The first dwellers of the land of Sulu were the people of\r\nMaymbung, whose rulers were the two brothers, Datu Sipad and Datu\r\nNarwangsa. After them came the people of Tagimaha, who formed another\r\nparty. After these came the Bajaw (Samals) from Juhur. These were\r\ndriven here by the tempest (monsoon) and were divided between both\r\nparties. Some of the Bajaw were driven by the tempest to Bruney and\r\nsome to Mindanao. After the arrival of the Bajaw, the people of Sulu\r\nbecame four parties. [70] Some time after that there came Karimul\r\n[71] Makdum. [72] He crossed the sea in a vase or pot of iron and\r\nwas called Sarip. [73] He settled at Bwansa, [74] the place where\r\nthe Tagimaha nobles lived. There the people flocked to him from all\r\ndirections, and he built a house for religious worship.\r\n\r\nTen years later Raja Baginda [75] came from Menangkabaw to\r\nSambuwangan. [76] From there he moved to Basilan and later to\r\nSulu. When he arrived at Sulu the chiefs of Bwansa tried to sink\r\nhis boats and drown him in the sea. He therefore resisted and fought\r\nthem. During the fight he inquired as to the reason why they wanted to\r\nsink his boats and drown him. He told them that he had committed no\r\ncrime against them and that he was not driven there by the tempest,\r\nbut that he was simply traveling, and came to Sulu to live among\r\nthem because they were Mohammedans. When they learned that he was a\r\nMohammedan, they respected him and received him hospitably. The chiefs\r\nof Sulu who were living at that time were Datu Layla [77] Ujan, Datu\r\nSana, Datu Amu, Datu Sultan, [78] Datu Basa, and Datu Ung. Another\r\nclass of chiefs called Mantiri were Tuan Jalal, [79] Tuan Akmat, [80]\r\nTuan Saylama, Tuan Hakim, Tuan Buda, Tuan Da'im, and Tuan Bujang. The\r\nTagimaha chiefs were Sayk [81] Ladun, Sayk Sahdu, and Sayk Bajsala. The\r\nBaklaya chiefs were Orangkaya Simtu and Orangkaya Ingsa. All the\r\nabove chiefs were living at the time Raja Baginda came to Sulu.\r\n\r\nThere also came to Sulu from Bwayan, [82] Sangilaya Bakti and Sangilaya\r\nMansalah. The latter's wife was Baliya'an Ñyaga.\r\n\r\nFive years after Raja Baginda's arrival at Sulu the Raja of Jawa\r\n[83] sent a messenger to Sulu with a present of wild elephants. The\r\nmessenger's name was Jaya. He died at Ansang, and two elephants only\r\narrived at Sulu.\r\n\r\nAfter that time there came Sayid [84] Abu Bakr from Palembang [85]\r\nto Bruney and from there to Sulu. When he arrived near the latter\r\nplace he met some people and asked them: \"Where is your town and where\r\nis your place of worship?\" They said, \"At Bwansa.\" He then came to\r\nBwansa and lived with Raja Baginda. The people respected him, and\r\nhe established a religion for Sulu. They accepted the new religion\r\nand declared their faith in it. After that Sayid Abu Bakr married\r\nParamisuli, the daughter of Raja Baginda, and he received the title\r\nof Sultan Sharif. [86] He begot children, and his descendants are\r\nliving to the present day. He lived about thirty years in Bwansa.\r\n\r\nAfter Abu Bakr, his son Kamalud Din succeeded to the sultanate. Alawad\r\n[87] Din did not become sultan. Putri [88] Sarip lived with her\r\nbrother Alawad Din. Alawad Din married Tuan Mayin, the daughter of\r\nTuan Layla. After the death of Sultan Kamalud Din, Maharaja [89]\r\nUpu succeeded to the sultanate. After the death of Upu, Pangiran [90]\r\nBuddiman became sultan. He was succeeded by Sultan Tanga. The sultans\r\nwho followed are, in the order of their succession, Sultan Bungsu,\r\n[91] Sultan Nasirud [92] Din, Sultan Karamat, [93] Sultan Shahabud\r\n[94] Din, Sultan Mustafa [95] called Shapiud [96] Din, Sultan Mohammed\r\nNasarud [97] Din, Sultan Alimud [98] Din I, Sultan Mohammed Mu`izzid\r\n[99] Din, Sultan Isra'il, [100] Sultan Mohammed Alimud Din II, Sultan\r\nMohammed Sarapud [101] Din, Sultan Mohammed Alimud Din III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSULU HISTORICAL NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThese notes were copied by the author from a book in the possession\r\nof Hadji Butu, prime minister to the Sultan of Sulu. Pages 1, 2,\r\nand 3 form a separate article. They appear to be a supplement to the\r\nGenealogy of Sulu, but they were undoubtedly derived from a different\r\nsource. Their contents are well known to the public and are probably\r\nan attempt on the part of Hadji Butu to register what seemed to him\r\na true and interesting tradition of his people.\r\n\r\nPage 4 was copied by the author from an old, dilapidated document\r\nwhich was torn in many places. It no doubt formed part of an authentic\r\ngenealogy of Sulu, older and more reliable than that of the manuscripts\r\non pages 148 and 149. It is written in Malay.\r\n\r\nPage 5 is a copy of a Sulu document issued by Sultan Jamalul-Kiram I\r\nin the year 1251 A. H., or about seventy-three years ago. It confers\r\nthe title of Khatib or Katib [102] on a Sulu pandita [103] named\r\nAdak. In conferring a title of this sort it is customary among the\r\nSulus to give the person so honored a new name, generally an Arabic\r\none, such as Abdur Razzak. [104] The same custom is observed in the\r\ncase of accession to the sultanate and other high offices.\r\n\r\nThe writing at the top of the page is the seal of Jamalul Kiram.

[105] His wife\r\nwas Indira [106] Suga. [107] They were sent here by Alexander the\r\nGreat. [108] Jamiyun Kulisa begot Tuan Masha'ika. [109] Masha'ika\r\nbegot Mawmin. [110] Mawmin's descendants multiplied greatly. They\r\nare the original inhabitants of Sulu and chief ancestors of the\r\npresent generation.\r\n\r\nTranslation of page 2 of the original manuscript.--In the days of\r\nthe Timway [111] Orangkaya Su'il the Sulus received from Manila four\r\nBisayan captives, one silver agong, [112] one gold hat, one gold\r\ncane, and one silver vase, as a sign of friendship between the two\r\ncountries. One of the captives had red eyes, one had black eyes; one,\r\nblue eyes; and one, white eyes.\r\n\r\nTranslation of page 3 of the original manuscript.--The red-eyed\r\nman was stationed at Parang, [113] and is the forefather of all the\r\npeople of Parang. The white-eyed man was stationed at Lati, [114]\r\nand is the forefather of all the people of Lati. The black-eyed man\r\nwas stationed at Gi'tung, [115] and is the forefather of the people\r\nof Gi'tung. The blue-eyed man was stationed at Lu'uk, [116] and is\r\nthe forefather of the people of Lu'uk. At that time the religion of\r\nMohammed had not come to Sulu.\r\n\r\nTranslation of page 4 of the original manuscript.--The first\r\ninhabitants of the Island of Sulu were the people of Maymbung. [117]\r\nThey were followed by the Tagimaha [118] and the Baklaya. [119] Later\r\ncame the Bajaw (Samals) from Juhur. Some Bajaws were taken by the\r\nSulus and were distributed among the three divisions of the island,\r\nwhile others drifted to Bruney and Magindanao. Some time after that\r\nthere came Karimul [120] Makdum. [121] He sailed in a pot of iron and\r\nthe ancients called him Sharif [122] Awliya. [123] The Sulus adopted\r\nthe Mohammedan religion and brought Makdum to Bwansa. [124] There\r\nthe Tagimaha chiefs built a mosque. Ten years later there arrived\r\nRaja Baginda, who emigrated from Menangkabaw. [125] Baginda came to\r\nZamboanga first. From there he moved to Basilan and Sulu. The natives\r\nmet him on the sea for the purpose of fighting him. He asked them,\r\n\"Why do you wish to fight a Mohammedan who is coming to live with\r\nyou?\" He married there.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commission of Khatib Abdur Razzak.\r\n\r\nThe Conqueror. By the order of the Omniscient King, The Sultan\r\nMohammed Jamalul Kiram. The year 1239.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranslation of page 5 of the original manuscript.--Dated Wednesday,\r\nthe tenth of Ramadan, in the year \"D,\" the first, which corresponds\r\nto the year 1251 of the Hegirah of the Prophet Mohammed, may the best\r\nof God's mercy and blessing be his. This day his majesty our master,\r\nthe Sultan Jamalul [126] Kiram [127] has granted Adak an official\r\ntitle by virtue of which he will be known as Khatib [128] Abdur [129]\r\nRazzak. [130] This is done in conference and consultation and with\r\nthe consent of all the people, without dissent.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the will of God the most High.\r\n\r\n(Signed)      The Sultan Jamaul Kiram.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               [The End.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nRISE AND PROSPERITY OF SULU\r\n\r\n\r\nSULU BEFORE ISLAM\r\n\r\nThe Genealogy of Sulu is a succinct analysis of the tribes or elements\r\nwhich constituted the bulk of the early inhabitants of the island and\r\nis the most reliable record we have of the historical events which\r\nantedated Islam.\r\n\r\nThe original inhabitants of the island are commonly referred to as\r\nBuranun or Budanun, which means \"mountaineers\" or \"hill people.\" This\r\nterm is occasionally used synonymously with Gimbahanun, which means\r\n\"people of the interior,\" and with Manubus in the sense of \"savage\r\nhill people\" or \"aborigines.\" Some of the old foreign residents of\r\nSulu maintain that they recognize considerable similarity between the\r\nBuranun and the Dayaks of Borneo, and say that the home utensils and\r\nclothes of the Sulus in the earlier days closely resembled those of\r\nthe Dayaks.\r\n\r\nThe capital of the Buranun was Maymbung. The earliest known ruler of\r\nMaymbung was Raja Sipad the Older, of whom nothing is related except\r\nthat he was the ancestor of Raja Sipad the Younger. In the days of the\r\nlatter there appeared Tuan Masha'ika, about whose ancestry there seems\r\nto be considerable ambiguity and difference of opinion. According to\r\nthe Genealogy of Sulu he was supposed to have issued out of a stalk\r\nof bamboo, and was held by the people as a prophet. The traditions\r\nstate that Tuan Masha'ika was the son of Jamiyun Kulisa and Indira\r\nSuga, who came to Sulu with Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\nJamiyun Kulisa and Indira Suga are mythological names [131] and in all\r\nprobability represent male and female gods related to the thunderbolt\r\nand the sun, respectively. The former religion of the Sulus was of\r\nHindu origin. It deified the various phenomena of nature and assigned\r\nthe highest places in its pantheon to Indra, the sky; Agni, the fire;\r\nVayu, the wind; Surya, the sun. The ancient Sulus no doubt had many\r\nmyths relating to the marriages and heroic deeds of their gods by\r\nwhich natural phenomena were explained, and it is not unlikely that\r\nthe above story of Jamiyun Kulisa was one of those myths. Taken in\r\nthis light, the above legend may express the belief of the ancient\r\nSulus that, by the marriage of the gods, Jamiyun Kulisa and Indira,\r\nrain fell and life was so imparted to the soil that plants grew.\r\n\r\nThe word Masha'ika is so written in the Malay text as to suggest its\r\nprobable formation from two words Masha and ika. The Sanskrit word\r\nMasha means \"pulse\" or \"plant.\" Ika or eka means \"one.\" On the other\r\nhand masha-ika may represent the two parts of the Sanskrit mashika\r\nwhich means \"five mashas.\" It may not therefore be improbable that\r\nmasha-ika refers to the subordinate deity which assumes the form of\r\na plant or signifies the first man, whom the deity created from a\r\nplant. It is not an uncommon feature of Malay legends to ascribe a\r\nsupernatural origin to the ancestor of the tribe, and Tuan Masha'ika\r\nprobably represents the admission into the Buranun stock of foreign\r\nblood and the rise of a chief not descended from Rajah Sipad the\r\nOlder. The tarsila [132] adds that he married the daughter of Raja\r\nSipad the Younger, Iddha, [133] and became the forefather of the\r\nprincipal people of Sulu.\r\n\r\nThe common belief among the Sulus that Alexander the Great invaded\r\ntheir island is one of many indications which lead one to think that\r\nmost of their knowledge and traditions came by the way of Malacca or\r\nJuhur, and possibly Tuan Masha'ika came from the same direction. It\r\ndoes seem therefore as if the dynasty of Sipad was supplanted by a\r\nforeign element represented by Tuan Masha'ika.\r\n\r\nThese two elements were later augmented by the Tagimaha who settled\r\nat Bwansa and along the coast west of that point, and by the Baklaya\r\nwho settled on the same coast east of the present site of Jolo. The\r\nfour tribes thus brought so closely together mixed very intimately\r\nand later lost their identity in the development of a single nation,\r\nwhich reached its maturity under the guiding hand of a Mohammedan\r\nmaster. In spite of later immigrations to the island and in spite of\r\nconquest and defeat, the national character thus formed has remained\r\nunchanged throughout history and the Sulu of to-day still maintains\r\nthat same individuality which he acquired in his earlier days.\r\n\r\nThe noted emigration of the Bajaws or Samals of Juhur must have begun\r\nin the earlier parts of the fourteenth century, if not earlier. These\r\nsea nomads came in such large numbers and in such quick succession as\r\nto people the whole Tawi-tawi Group, the Pangutaran and Siasi Groups,\r\nall available space on the coast of Sulu proper, the Balangingi Group,\r\nand the coasts of Basilan and Zamboanga, before the close of the\r\ncentury and before the arrival of the first Mohammedan pioneers.\r\n\r\nThe Samals exceeded the Sulus in number, and the effect of\r\nsuch overwhelming immigration must have been considerable; but,\r\nnevertheless, the Sulu maintained his nationality and rose to the\r\noccasion in a most remarkable manner. The newcomers were taken into his\r\nfold and were given his protection, for which they rendered noteworthy\r\nservice; but their relation was never allowed to exceed that of a\r\nslave to his master or that of a subject to his ruler, and the Samals\r\nthus remained like strangers or guests in the land until a late date.\r\n\r\nBesides the Samals, some Bugis [134] and Ilanun emigrants gained\r\na foothold on the northern and northeastern coast of Sulu. The\r\nBugis appear to have lost their identity, but the Ilanun are still\r\nrecognizable in many localities, and some of the principal datus of\r\nSulu still trace their origin to Mindanao.\r\n\r\nThe numerous and extensive piratical expeditions undertaken by the\r\nSulus from time immemorial must have been a great source of further\r\ninflux of foreign blood. The earliest traditions say that, in the days\r\nof the Timway, [135] Orangkaya Su'il, slaves or hostages were sent\r\nby the raja of Manila to secure the friendship of the Sulus. These\r\nslaves were, according to some accounts, of six colors, but the\r\nwritten records give them as four--red-eyed, white-eyed, blue-eyed,\r\nand black-eyed. The people do not entertain any doubt relative to the\r\ntruth of these statements, and the custom is current even among the\r\nSamals of referring to the origin of some person as descended from\r\nthe red-eyed slave, in making distinction as to whether he comes from\r\na noble or is of low birth and as to the part of the country to which\r\nhe belongs. According to general opinion the red-eyed slaves lived at\r\nParang, the western section of the island; the white-eyed at Lati,\r\nthe northern section lying to the east of Jolo; the black-eyed at\r\nGi'tung, the middle and southern section; the blue-eyed at Lu'uk,\r\nthe eastern section.\r\n\r\nThis color distinction is difficult to explain, but it must have arisen\r\nout of the established custom of dividing slaves and captives, after\r\nreturning from a piratical expedition, among the great chiefs of the\r\nvarious parties which composed the expedition. These parties as a rule\r\nbelonged to four sections representing the four great districts of the\r\nisland, over each of which one chief formerly was in authority. [136]\r\n\r\nThe number of elements which have thus entered into the constitution of\r\nthe Sulu people must be great, for there was not a single island in the\r\nPhilippine Archipelago which was spared by these marauders. Indeed,\r\nthe nation owes its origin and its chief characters to piracy. As\r\npirates these people took refuge in this island and lived in it, and\r\nas pirates they have stamped their reputation on the annals of history.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Sulus do not differ in this particular point from\r\nthe Malays of other countries. All Malays were equally addicted to\r\npiracy. \"It is in the Malay's nature,\" says an intelligent Dutch\r\nwriter, \"to rove on the seas in his prau, as it is in that of the\r\nArab to wander with his steed on the sands of the desert. It is as\r\nimpossible to limit the adventurous life of a Malay to fishing and\r\ntrading as to retain a Bedouin in a village or in a habitation. * * *\r\nThis is not merely their habit; it may be termed their instinct.\" [137]\r\n\r\n\"As surely as spiders abound where there are nooks and corners,\"\r\nsays another, \"so have pirates sprung up wherever there is a nest\r\nof islands offering creeks and shallows, headlands, rocks, and\r\nreefs--facilities, in short, for lurking, for surprise, for attack,\r\nand for escape. The semibarbarous inhabitant of the Archipelago,\r\nborn and bred in this position, naturally becomes a pirate. It is as\r\nnatural to him to consider any well-freighted, ill-protected boat\r\nhis property as it is to the fishing eagle above his head to sweep\r\ndown upon the weaker but more hardworking bird and swallow what he\r\nhas not had the trouble of catching.\"\r\n\r\nSo we are told that before the days of Makdum and Raja Baginda,\r\nSulu had long been an emporium not only of regular traders from most\r\nnations, but the headquarters of those piratical marauders who there\r\nfound a ready market for enslaved victims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION OF ISLAM AND THE RISE OF A MOHAMMEDAN DYNASTY IN SULU,\r\n1380-1450\r\n\r\nTo this period belongs the Mohammedan invasion of the Archipelago. If\r\nthe Buranun [138] were Dayaks in origin, they certainly did not\r\nkeep their Dayak characteristics very long. For in all probability\r\nTuan Masha'ika, the Tagimahas, and the Baklayas were Malays [139]\r\nwho came into Sulu from the west, and the dynasty established by\r\nMasha'ika must have exercised due influence on the Buranun. Whatever\r\nreligion or customs these Malay conquerors had in their original land,\r\nthey no doubt continued to practise in their new home. It does not\r\nappear that the Samals produced any change in this respect, and the\r\nsame worship and social organization which the Sulus had remained\r\nunchanged until the Mohammedans reached the Archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe two prominent characters who mark this era are Makdum and Raja\r\nBaginda. Makdum was a noted Arabian judge or scholar who arrived at\r\nMalacca about the middle of the fourteenth century, converted Sultan\r\nMohammed Shah, the ruler, to Islam and established this religion\r\nthroughout the state of Malacca. He evidently practised magic and\r\nmedicine and exerted an unusually strong influence on the people\r\nof Malacca. Continuing farther east, he reached Sulu and Mindanao\r\nabout the year 1380. [140] In Sulu, it is said, he visited almost\r\nevery island of the Archipelago and made converts to Islam in many\r\nplaces. The Island of Sibutu claims his grave, but the places at\r\nwhich he was most successful are Bwansa, the old capital of Sulu,\r\nand the Island of Tapul. It is said that the people of Bwansa built\r\na mosque for him, and some of the chiefs of the town accepted his\r\nteachings and faith. The Tapul people claim descent from him, and\r\nsome of them still regard him as a prophet.\r\n\r\nMakdum's success in preaching a new faith to people as independent\r\nin their individual views and as pertinacious in their religious\r\npractices, beliefs, and customs as the Sulus must have been in his\r\ntime, is certainly remarkable and creditable to a high degree. The\r\nresults of his mission to Malacca and Sulu throw a new light on the\r\nhistory of Islam in the Philippine Islands and modify the opinion\r\nformerly held relative to its introduction by the sword. How much of\r\na lasting effect the teachings of Makdum could have had on Sulu is\r\nvery difficult of estimation, but in all probability the new sapling\r\nplanted in the soil of Sulu would have withered before long had it\r\nnot been for the future current of events which watered it and reared\r\nit to maturity.\r\n\r\nSome time after Makdum (the Genealogy of Sulu says ten years)\r\nthere came into Sulu a prince from Menangkabaw called Raja\r\nBaginda. Menangkabaw [141] is a rich, high region in central Sumatra,\r\nfrom which many Malayan dynasties seem to have come. Raja was the usual\r\ntitle applied to all Malayan kings. Baginda is said to have touched at\r\nSambuwangan (Zamboanga) and Basilan before reaching Sulu. The nature\r\nof such a move can not be explained unless he followed the northern\r\nroute leading from Borneo to Kagayan Sulu, Pangutaran, and Zamboanga,\r\nwhich route seems to have been taken by all Mohammedan missionaries\r\nand invaders mentioned in the tarsila.\r\n\r\nThe written records of Baginda's arrival and his later history are\r\nexceedingly brief. When he arrived at Bwansa, the Sulus came out to\r\nengage him in battle, as we would naturally expect; but, the tarsila\r\ncontinues, on learning that he was a Mohammedan, they desisted from\r\nfighting, invited him to stay with them, and seem to have entertained\r\nhim very hospitably. Such an account is absurd on the face of it. Raja\r\nBaginda was not a trader nor a traveler touring the Archipelago. He\r\nwas accompanied by ministers and no doubt came to Bwansa to stay\r\nand rule. His coming was an ordinary kind of invasion, which proved\r\nsuccessful. When Abu Bakr reached Bwansa, as we will learn later, he\r\nwas directed to Raja Baginda, who must have been the supreme ruler\r\nof Bwansa. Accordingly we find all the chiefs of Sulu enumerated\r\nin the tarsila at the day of Baginda's arrival subordinate in rank,\r\nhaving no \"rajas\" among them.\r\n\r\nThe Genealogy of Sulu is as misleading as the tarsila of Magindanao\r\nin that it pictures the arrival of Baginda as peaceful as that\r\nof Kabungsuwan. Some of the chiefs who were Mohammedans possibly\r\nintrigued against their former overlords, and, joining Baginda's\r\nforces, defeated their opponents; but the dearth of information\r\nrelative to this early Philippine history renders it impracticable to\r\nsecure any more light on the subject. It may not, however, be out of\r\nplace to remind the reader that the fourteenth century was marked by\r\nunusual activity in methods of warfare. Gunpowder, which was known and\r\nused as an explosive long before that date, had not been made use of in\r\nthrowing projectiles in battle. The Arabs, we know, used firearms early\r\nin the fourteenth century, and we may conjecture that they introduced\r\nsuch weapons into Malacca and other parts of Malaysia as they moved\r\neast. It is not improbable then that a prince coming from Sumatra\r\nwas provided with firearms which overawed the ignorant inhabitants of\r\nBwansa and subdued the valor and courage of the Sulu and Samal pirates\r\nof those days. The statement made in the tarsila of Magindanao that,\r\nafter the people of Slangan came down the river to where Kabungsuwan\r\nwas anchored, \"He beckoned (or pointed his finger) to them, but one\r\nof them died on that account, and they were frightened and returned,\"\r\nis the only kind of evidence found which can possibly be interpreted to\r\nindicate that a firearm was used. Lacking confirmation as this may be,\r\nyet we positively know that when the Spaniards reached these Islands,\r\nthese people had an abundance of firearms, muskets, lantaka [142]\r\nand other cannon, and we may be justified in saying that probably\r\nfirearms existed in the land in the century preceding the arrival of\r\nthe Spaniards. This brings us approximately down to Baginda's days.\r\n\r\nIn considering the etymology of the titles of the Sulu chiefs mentioned\r\nin the time of Baginda, we observe that they are of three classes. The\r\nfirst class were the datus. These had mantiri or ministers and probably\r\nrepresented the descendants of Raja Sipad and Tuan Masha'ika. The\r\nsecond class were the sayk. \"Sayk\" is probably derived from the Arabic\r\n\"Sheikh\" meaning \"chief.\" These were the Tagimaha chiefs, and their\r\nrank was evidently subordinate to that of datu. The third class were\r\nthe orangkaya, the Baklaya chiefs. These are also subordinate in\r\ngrade and could not have been higher than the sayk. The words datu\r\nand orangkaya it must be remembered are of Malay origin, while raja\r\nand baginda are Sanskrit, baginda being the highest and being often\r\nused as equivalent to emperor, while raja means only king.\r\n\r\nJawa is the Malay term for Java. The incident related in the tarsila\r\nrelative to the gift of two elephants sent by the raja of Java to the\r\nraja of Sulu is interesting, in that it explains the existence in Jolo\r\nof the elephants found there during the earlier Spanish invasions. It\r\nfurther indicates that Raja Baginda was not an insignificant chief\r\nand that he kept up some kind of communication with the rajas of\r\nwestern Malaysia.\r\n\r\nThe elephants received by Baginda were let loose, the story says,\r\nand they lived and multiplied on Mount Tumangtangis. On the declivity\r\nof this mountain there is a place still called lubluban-gaja, which\r\nmeans the \"habitat or lying-place of the elephant.\" The people relate\r\nseveral stories which make mention of the elephant, one of which\r\ndeclares that the chief who killed the last wild elephant was given\r\nthe hand of the sultan's daughter in marriage, in admiration of his\r\nstrength and bravery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESTABLISHMENT OF THE MOHAMMEDAN CHURCH IN SULU AND THE REIGN OF ABU\r\nBAKR, 1450-1480\r\n\r\nBrevity is without exception a marked characteristic of all Moro\r\nwritings. Their letters, unlike those of the Malays and Arabs, are\r\nbrief and devoid of compliment or detail.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to pick out a superfluous word or phrase from the\r\ntext of the Sulu tarsila. In fact, the narrative of events throughout\r\nthe manuscript is so curtailed as to be reduced to a mere synopsis of\r\nheadlines. It gives a very dim view of the general subject and leaves\r\nout much that is desired. Thus, the whole question of establishing\r\nIslam in Sulu and organizing its sultanate is dispensed with in one\r\nshort paragraph briefly enumerating the following facts: That Sayid\r\nAbu Bakr came to Bwansa from Palembang by the way of Bruney; that he\r\nlived with Raja Baginda and taught and established a new religion\r\nfor Sulu; that he was greatly respected by the people; and that he\r\nmarried Paramisuli, the daughter of Baginda, and became sultan.\r\n\r\nThe traditions of the country, notwithstanding their brevity, add\r\nsome further but less reliable information. It is the common belief\r\nthat Abu Bakr was born in Mecca and that he lived some time at Juhur\r\n(or Malacca). Others state that it was his father, Zaynul Abidin,\r\nwho came from Mecca and that Abu Bakr was born of the daughter of\r\nthe Sultan of Juhur at Malacca. He came to Pangutaran first, the\r\nnarrative continues, then to Zamboanga and Basilan. His younger\r\nbrother, who had accompanied him, continued eastward to Mindanao,\r\nwhile he remained at Basilan for a short while. Having heard of Abu\r\nBakr, the people of Sulu sent Orangkaya Su'il to Basilan to invite\r\nhim to Bwansa to rule over them. This invitation was accepted and\r\nAbu Bakr was inaugurated sultan over Sulu soon after his arrival there.\r\n\r\nFrom the annals of Malacca we know that Abu Bakr was a famous authority\r\non law and religion and that his mission to Malaysia was prompted by\r\nenthusiasm for the promulgation of the doctrines of Abu Ishaq, which\r\nwere embodied in a book entitled \"Darul-Mazlum, or The House of the\r\nOppressed or Ignorant.\" After preaching these doctrines in Malacca with\r\nsuccess, he evidently proceeded farther east, stopping at Palembang\r\nand Bruney and reaching Sulu about 1450. The hospitality with which\r\nhe was received at Bwansa points to success in his mission to a degree\r\nthat enabled him later to marry the Princess Paramisuli, the daughter\r\nof Raja Baginda. He established mosques there and taught religion and\r\nlaw; and the people and chiefs actually abandoned their former gods\r\nand practiced the new religion and observed its commandments. This\r\nprocess of reformation and conversion was no doubt slow and gradual,\r\nbut it was real and sure.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence to show that Abu Bakr had any military forces\r\nby virtue of which he could assume military authority and rule after\r\nBaginda's death. But it is perfectly credible that Raja Baginda,\r\nbeing without a male heir, appointed Abu Bakr, his son-in-law and\r\nchief judge and priest, as his heir, and delegated to him all the\r\nauthority he exercised over Bwansa and the Island of Sulu. This\r\nit appears was acquiesced in by the native chiefs who accepted\r\nAbu Bakr as their temporal overlord, as well as their spiritual\r\nmaster. Claiming descent from Mohammed, he assumed the powers of a\r\ncaliph and entitled himself sultan. The Sulus as a rule refer to him\r\nas As-Sultan ash-Sharif al-Hashimi, meaning the Sultan, the Hashimite\r\nSharif or noble. The words Mohammed and Abu Bakr are generally left\r\nout when he is mentioned in prayer or in ordinary discourse.\r\n\r\nHaving established the church, his next aim, after ascending the throne\r\nof Sulu, was the political reorganization of the government. This he\r\nundertook to frame on the same principles as those of an Arabian\r\nsultanate, giving himself all the power and prerogatives of a\r\ncaliph. In enforcing such claims of absolute sovereignty, Abu Bakr\r\ndeclared to the people and their local chiefs that the widows, the\r\norphans, and the land were his by right. This the people hesitated\r\nto submit to, and another measure was adopted which reconciled the\r\ninterests of all parties. They agreed that all the shores of the\r\nisland and all that territory within which the royal gong or drum\r\ncould be heard should be the sultan's personal property, and that\r\nthe rest of the island should be divided among the subordinate\r\nchiefs and their people. The island was accordingly divided into\r\nfive administrative districts, over each one of which one panglima\r\nexercised power subject to the supervision and superior authority of\r\nthe sultan. These districts were again divided into smaller divisions,\r\nwhich were administered by subordinate officers or chiefs called\r\nmaharaja, orangkaya, laksamana, parukka, etc. The districts were\r\ncalled Parang, Pansul, Lati, Gi'tung, and Lu'uk. The boundaries which\r\nit seemed necessary at that time to define were marked by large trees,\r\nnone of which is living at present. Thus a sangay [143] tree separated\r\nParang from Pansul. The location of this tree was at a point near Bud\r\nAgad and the stream Agahun, which runs down from Tumangtangis toward\r\nMaymbung. A bawnu [143] tree separated Pansul from Lati. This tree was\r\nlocated at a place called Indung, intermediate between Asturias and\r\nthe walled town of Jolo. A mampalam [143] tree called Tarak separated\r\nLati from Lu'uk. It was in the vicinity of the settlement of Su'. A\r\nvariety of durian tree named Siggal-saggal formed the boundary of\r\nLati and Gi'tung.\r\n\r\nAccording to later usage, these districts are defined as follows:\r\nParang is the western district lying west of a line passing through a\r\npoint east of the summit of Tumangtangis and a point on the southern\r\ncoast 3 miles west of Maymbung. A line passing through Mount Pula\r\nand a point a little east of Maymbung marks the boundary between\r\nPansul on the west and Lati and Gi'tung on the east. The watershed is\r\ngenerally considered as the dividing line between Lati and Gi'tung. A\r\nline joining Su' on the north and Lubuk on the south separates Lati\r\nand Gi'tung from Lu'uk. A sixth district has lately been carved out\r\nand termed Tandu, forming the easternmost part of the island. A line\r\njoining Sukuban on the south and Limawa on the north divides Tandu\r\nand Lu'uk.\r\n\r\nThe government thus organized was conducted in conformity with local\r\ncustoms and laws modified to such an extent as not to be repugnant\r\nand contrary to Mohammedan laws and the precepts of the Quran. To\r\npreserve this consistency, a code of laws was made and promulgated\r\nby Abu Bakr. This, once established, became the guide of all the\r\nsubordinate officers of the state, who, as a rule, observed it and\r\ncarried out its instructions. The general lines on which Abu Bakr\r\nconducted his government seem to have been followed very closely by all\r\nhis successors. Such an adventurous and aggressive man as he was could\r\nnot have stopped within the limits of the island. In all probability\r\nhe pushed out in various directions, but no records have so far been\r\nfound which give any account of the conquests he made or the limits\r\nof his empire. Abu Bakr lived thirty years in Sulu and died about 1480.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY DAYS OF THE SULTANATE, 1480-1635\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCCESSORS OF ABU BAKR\r\n\r\nThe dynasty founded by Abu Bakr ruled with a firmer hand and attained\r\nconsiderable power and fame. The new organization establishing\r\nlaw and order, consolidated the forces of the state and increased\r\nits influence on the outside world. Islam added a new element of\r\nstrength and another stimulus to campaign and conquest. The Sulus never\r\nexceeded 60,000 in number, yet we learn that, prior to the arrival of\r\nMagellan, their power was felt all over Luzon and the Bisayan Islands,\r\nthe Celebes Sea, Palawan, North Borneo, and the China Sea, and their\r\ntrade extended from China and Japan, at the one extreme, to Malacca,\r\nSumatra, and Java at the other.\r\n\r\nAbu Bakr was succeeded by his second son, Kamalud-Din. Alawad-Din,\r\nthe elder son, was weak-minded and was evidently not supported by\r\nthe ministers of the state. The next three sultans who followed\r\nwere Diraja, Upu, and Digunung. Their full names are, the Sultan\r\nAmirul Umara [144] Maharaja Diraja, the Sultan Mu`izzul Mutawadi`in\r\n[145] Maharaja Upu, the Sultan Nasirud-Din Awal [146] Digunung [147]\r\n(or Habud [148]).\r\n\r\nThe sixth sultan was Mohammedul Halim [149] Pangiran Buddiman. During\r\nhis reign Governor Sandé equipped and directed large expeditions to\r\nBorneo and Sulu. The armada sent to Sulu was commanded by Capt. Esteban\r\nRodriguez de Figueroa and reached the town of Jolo in June, 1578. It\r\nis asserted that Rodriguez defeated Pangiran and exacted tribute from\r\nthe Sulus. Rodriguez, however, did not occupy Jolo, and no permanent\r\nadvantage was derived from his victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIGUEROA'S EXPEDITION AGAINST SULU\r\n\r\nThis invasion marked the beginning of a state of war between Sulu\r\nand Spain, which covered a period of three hundred years and caused\r\nconsiderable devastation and loss of life. It cost Spain an immense\r\nloss of men and money and finally brought on the decline of Sulu\r\nand its end as an independent state. The magnitude of this strife,\r\nits far-reaching effects, and its bearing on the Spanish and American\r\noccupation of Sulu, invites special attention to the causes of the\r\nwar and the Sulu character which it depicts.\r\n\r\nThe expedition to Jolo formed part of and immediately followed the\r\nexpedition which was directed by Governor Sandé against Borneo. There\r\nis no doubt that, besides the reasons Sandé gave for the expedition\r\nto Borneo, he was really actuated by jealousy of the Portuguese,\r\nwhose influence had reached Bruney and the Moluccas, and by a strong\r\ndesire to conquer Borneo, Sulu, Mindanao, and the Moluccas. His\r\nreasons for sending the expedition against Sulu are best given in\r\nhis letter of instructions to Capt. Rodriguez de Figueroa, which is\r\nextremely interesting and is herein quoted in full: [150]\r\n\r\n\r\n    That which you, Capt. Esteban Rodriguez de Figueroa, shall\r\n    observe on the expedition which you are about to make, God our\r\n    Lord helping, is as follows:\r\n\r\n    From this city and Island of Borneo, God willing, you shall go\r\n    to the Islands of Sulu, where you shall endeavor to reduce that\r\n    chief and his people to the obedience of his Majesty. You shall\r\n    bargain with them as to what tribute they shall pay, which shall\r\n    be in pearls, as they are wont to give to the King of Bruney. You\r\n    shall exercise great care and, if possible, much mildness; for it\r\n    is of importance that those islands should not become depopulated;\r\n    therefore, in case they receive you peaceably, you shall treat\r\n    them well. And, in addition to the above, you must order that,\r\n    besides the tribute that they are to pay in pearls, they shall\r\n    obtain as many of them as possible, so that we, the Spaniards or\r\n    Castilians, may buy them; that they must trade with us from now on;\r\n    that every year Castilians will go to their lands with cloths and\r\n    merchandise from China, of whatever they shall declare that they\r\n    may need. You shall inform yourself of their needs; and if they\r\n    wish to come to our settlements you shall give them permission to\r\n    go freely to Manila and to come to Borneo, although not to steal.\r\n\r\n    Item: You shall find out from them the whereabouts of the artillery\r\n    and anchors of a ship lost there some three years ago; and you\r\n    shall seek it and see that it be brought you with all haste. You\r\n    shall keep close watch over the artillery, ammunition, vessels,\r\n    sails, and other like things pertaining to the armed fleet; and\r\n    you shall deprive them of those supplies, for it is notorious\r\n    that those people are common marauders.\r\n\r\n    And because of my information that the chief who calls himself\r\n    lord of Sulu is a Bornean, and owns houses in this city of Bruney;\r\n    that he fought against us in the naval battle, and that he fled\r\n    to Sulu, where he is now; and since I am told that he took two\r\n    galleys and three small vessels, artillery and ammunition, you\r\n    shall exercise the utmost despatch to obtain the said galleys,\r\n    vessels, artillery, and ammunition. If he acquiesce, you shall\r\n    give him a passport. You shall see whether he has any children;\r\n    and if so, you shall take one, and tell him that he must come to\r\n    see me in Bruney in February.\r\n\r\n    And, as I have said, this must be done if possible gently,\r\n    in order that no people may be killed. You shall tell him that\r\n    it will be to their advantage to be vassals of his Majesty and\r\n    our allies. If they do not act respectfully, and it shall be\r\n    necessary to punish them in another manner, you shall do so. And\r\n    inasmuch as the Sulus, as is well known, are open pirates, whose\r\n    only ambition is to steal, and to assault men in order to sell\r\n    them elsewhere--especially as they go annually for plunder among\r\n    all the Pintados [151] Islands, which are under his Majesty's\r\n    dominion--you shall try to ascertain the Pintados slaves among\r\n    them, in order to return such to their homes, especially those\r\n    who are Christians. And, as I have said, you shall deprive them\r\n    of such vessels as seem to be used for raids, leaving them their\r\n    fishing vessels, so that if the said lord of Sulu so desire, he\r\n    can come to confer reasonably with me. Thus you shall ascertain\r\n    who has vessels, and who can inflict injuries; and you shall\r\n    command them expressly to settle down on their land, to cultivate,\r\n    sow, and harvest, develop the pearl industry, and cease to be\r\n    pirates. You shall order them to raise fowls and cattle. You shall\r\n    try to ascertain their number, and bring it to me in writing, in\r\n    order that I may see it, together with the distance from these\r\n    islands to the Sulu Islands, information regarding the food,\r\n    water, and healthfulness of that land, and other things that may\r\n    occur to you. And you shall tell the people in my name that they\r\n    shall tame for me a couple of elephants, and that I shall send\r\n    for those animals and pay for them.\r\n\r\n    After having finished affairs in Sulu, if time permits, you shall,\r\n    God willing, go to the Island of Mindanao. There you shall try,\r\n    by the most convenient methods and with friendliness, to reduce\r\n    the chief of the river of Mindanao, and the other chiefs of that\r\n    island, and of those near by, to the obedience of his Majesty,\r\n    giving him to understand what they will gain in becoming his\r\n    Majesty's vassals and our allies, and in having trade with us.\r\n\r\n    And, in order that the tribute may not prevent them from making\r\n    peace with us, you shall not ask them for any tribute; but you\r\n    shall take what they give freely, and nothing more, and in such\r\n    form as they are willing to give. Thus you shall suit their\r\n    convenience in everything pertaining to them, and cause them to\r\n    understand the great expenses of his Majesty in this land. You\r\n    shall also tell them that the gain therefrom affects them chiefly,\r\n    since we come to teach them our civilization, and most of all\r\n    the service of God, our Lord, who created and redeemed them, and\r\n    of whom they are ignorant; and how to live in accord with natural\r\n    law, as is their obligation. For this purpose you shall tell them\r\n    that you are going to their land for two principal reasons:\r\n\r\n    The first is that they should cease to be pirates, who rob and\r\n    harry the weak, and enslave wherever and whomsoever they can,\r\n    selling their captives outside of their own island, and separating\r\n    them from their wives and children; and that they must cease to\r\n    commit other like cruelties and thefts, and must become good and\r\n    virtuous men, who shall grow to merit the second and principal\r\n    reason for going to their lands. You shall give them to understand\r\n    that they are ignorant of God, our Lord, who created and redeemed\r\n    them, so that when they know him they may serve him and become\r\n    good. It is quite evident that they will gain very much in these\r\n    things, and therefore it is right that they aid us and give us\r\n    something. This shall be at their own will, as above said.\r\n\r\n    Item: You shall order them not to admit any more preachers of\r\n    the doctrine of Mohammed, since it is evil and false, and that\r\n    of the Christians alone is good. And because we have been in\r\n    these regions so short a time, the lord of Mindanao has been\r\n    deceived by the preachers of Bruney, and the people have become\r\n    Moros. You shall tell them that our object is that he be converted\r\n    to Christianity; and that he must allow us freely to preach the\r\n    law of the Christians, and the natives must be allowed to go to\r\n    hear the preaching and to be converted, without receiving any\r\n    harm from the chiefs.\r\n\r\n    And you shall try to ascertain who are the preachers of the sect\r\n    of Mohammed, and shall seize and bring them before me and you\r\n    shall burn or destroy the house where that accursed doctrine has\r\n    been preached, and you shall order that it be not rebuilt.\r\n\r\n    Item: You shall order that the Indians [152] shall not go outside\r\n    of their island to trade; and you shall seize those vessels used\r\n    for plundering excursions, leaving them those which, in your\r\n    judgment, are used for trade and fishing. You shall take also\r\n    what artillery and ammunition they have.\r\n\r\n    You shall ascertain the harvest seasons and products of the land;\r\n    the gold mines and the places where they wash gold; the number\r\n    of inhabitants and their settlements; and their customs. You\r\n    must especially secure information regarding cinnamon, in order\r\n    to ascertain if it is found along the river, or if one must go\r\n    to Cavite for it, and why it is not as good as that which the\r\n    Portuguese take to Castilla. You shall ascertain how they cut\r\n    and strip it from the tree, and if it be of importance that it\r\n    dry on the tree, or in what other manner it should be treated,\r\n    for I have been told that that obtained from these districts in\r\n    the past has not been good and has not a good sale in Spain.\r\n\r\n    And, since it might happen that the people will not make peace,\r\n    and may offer fight, and show disrespect, then you shall punish\r\n    them as you deem best, taking special care not to trust them;\r\n    for it is evident that before all else they will, if possible,\r\n    commit some treachery. You must not await such an occasion,\r\n    for we know already their treachery against his Majesty's fleet\r\n    commanded by Villalobos, certain of whose men they killed under\r\n    assurances of safety; and they seized a boat. In that treachery\r\n    all the inhabitants of the islands were participants; for four\r\n    or five thousand of the said natives attacked one small boat,\r\n    which contained four or five Spaniards. Likewise many people\r\n    took part in the killing of the said Villalobos's master-of-camp,\r\n    and other soldiers, in that same year. You shall remind them of\r\n    these things, and warn them; for, from now on, we shall destroy\r\n    them and their generation.\r\n\r\n    And, since it might happen that, without any occasion of war\r\n    or peace, the said natives flee to the mountains, you shall\r\n    order that certain of the said natives summon them; and, when\r\n    they have come, you shall discuss the matter with them. If they\r\n    refuse to come, you shall, in conformity with your orders, remain\r\n    there a given time. And if they continue to refuse to come down,\r\n    you shall leave them, and shall return, without permitting their\r\n    houses to be burned or their palm trees to be cut down. Neither\r\n    shall anything be stolen from them; but you shall take only what\r\n    is absolutely necessary for food and the food and other things\r\n    necessary to provision your vessels for the return trip.\r\n\r\n    You shall try to secure information of the Island of Linboton,\r\n    as well as of Batachina and Celebes, so as to advise me thereof;\r\n    and you shall do this in accord with the time limit I have set\r\n    for you to make this exploration, and you shall observe the same\r\n    rule as in that of Mindanao.\r\n\r\n    In order that we may allot in encomiendas [153] whatever people\r\n    are found in these districts, you shall bring me a signed\r\n    notarial writ. Thus, as those lands have no other owner, the\r\n    natives thereof may be reduced to the obedience of his Majesty,\r\n    according to his will--and by war, if the natives begin it, so\r\n    that war on our part may be just, and that the same justice may\r\n    continue, so that we can compel them to obey, and impose tributes\r\n    upon them. You shall exercise much diligence in this and see to\r\n    it that these orders be carried out carefully and intelligently.\r\n\r\n    God willing, I shall be in Bruney by the end of the month of\r\n    January next--or, at the latest, by the eighth of February--with\r\n    the fleet and all the necessaries that must be brought from Manila,\r\n    and that which is here. And at that time your grace shall come to\r\n    Bruney with the fleet that you have, and with all the people that\r\n    you have or shall have in the Pintados, so that we may do here\r\n    whatever is proper for the service of his Majesty, to which we are\r\n    bound. These instructions must not be disregarded in any point,\r\n    unless I advise you to the contrary by letter. And to this end\r\n    you shall see that all who live and dwell there be commissioned\r\n    for the above, in addition to their own duties. Given at Bruney,\r\n    May twenty-three, one thousand five hundred and seventy-eight.\r\n\r\n    If the natives of Mindanao or of any other place shall give\r\n    tribute according to the above, you shall act according to the\r\n    usual custom in these islands--namely, you shall take one-half\r\n    and place it to the account of his Majesty, while the other half\r\n    shall be distributed among the soldiers. Given ut supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Doctor Francisco de Sandé.\r\n\r\n        Before me:\r\n            Alonso Beltran,\r\n              His Majesty's notary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS FOR HOSTILITIES\r\n\r\nThe above shows clearly that Governor Sandé intended, first, to reduce\r\nSulu to a vassal state; second, to exact tribute in pearls; third,\r\nto secure the trade of Sulu for the Spaniards; fourth, to punish the\r\nSultan of Sulu for the help he rendered the Sultan of Bruney against\r\nthe Spanish forces; fifth, to rescue the Christian slaves in Sulu;\r\nsixth, to deprive the Sulus of their artillery and ammunition and of\r\nall vessels except fishing vessels, in order to stop their piracy;\r\nseventh, to compel the Sulus to become peaceful agriculturists;\r\neighth, to uproot the \"accursed doctrine\" of Mohammed and to convert\r\nthe Sulus to the Christian religion.\r\n\r\nThe leader of the expedition was directed to carry out these\r\ninstructions as carefully and as gently as possible; and there is\r\nno reason to think that he failed to comply with his orders to the\r\nletter. But no matter how careful and faithful Captain Rodriguez could\r\nhave been, it was not difficult for the Sulus to understand the purpose\r\nof the expedition and the motives of the Spanish Government, and it\r\ndoes not stand to reason that such people would yield to vassalage\r\nand receive a direct insult to their religion without resentment\r\nand without a struggle. Governor Sandé knew the reputation of the\r\nSulus, but he must have underestimated their strength and failed to\r\nprovide garrisons for the occupation of the conquered territory and\r\nthe protection of peaceful natives.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1579, Governor Sandé sent an expedition to Mindanao,\r\ncommanded by Capt. Gabriel de Ribera, under instructions similar to\r\nthose given to Captain Rodriguez. Ribera had additional orders to\r\nvisit Jolo and collect the tribute for that year, and special stress\r\nwas laid on procuring from the Sultan of Sulu \"two or three tame\r\nelephants.\" Ribera accomplished nothing in Mindanao; the natives\r\nabandoned their villages and fled to the interior. On his return\r\nto Kawite or Caldera, he met a deputation from Jolo, which brought\r\ninsignificant tribute and informed him of the existence of famine in\r\nSulu and the extreme distress of the people. He returned their tribute,\r\nreceiving in its place a cannon, which the Sulus had obtained from\r\na wrecked Portuguese galley. Ribera then returned to Cebu, without\r\nproducing any significant effect on conditions in Sulu.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1580, Governor Sandé was relieved by Governor Gonzalo\r\nRonquillo, who did not take the same interest in Borneo and\r\nSulu. In the same year the kingdom of Portugal and its rich eastern\r\ncolonies were annexed to the Spanish domain. No danger could then be\r\nexpected from the direction of Borneo and Sulu, and the ambitious\r\nnew Governor-General turned his attention to more desirable fields\r\nof conquest.\r\n\r\nPiracy was not the primary cause of this invasion of Sulu. Public\r\nsentiment was not so strong against slavery in those days as it\r\nis now; for the Spaniards and other leading civilized nations were\r\nthen diligently pursuing a profitable trade in it between the west\r\ncoast of Africa and the West Indies and America. Piracy is always a\r\ncrime among nations, but it can not be urged as the principal and\r\nleading cause of this war or as sufficient reason in itself for\r\nthe early precipitation of such a deadly conflict between Sulu and\r\nSpain. Religion, on the other hand, was declared by Governor Sandé\r\nto be the \"principal reason for going to their lands.\" He ordered\r\nthe Sulus not to admit any more preachers of Islam, but to allow\r\nthe Spanish priests to preach Christianity to them. The Mohammedan\r\npreachers he directed to be arrested and brought to him, and the\r\nmosques to be burned or destroyed and not to be rebuilt.\r\n\r\nPart of the instructions the Adelantado [154] Miguel Lopez de Legaspi\r\nreceived before embarking on his expedition to the Philippines read\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    And you shall have especial care that, in all your negotiations\r\n    with the natives of those regions some of the religious\r\n    accompanying you be present, both in order to avail yourself of\r\n    their good counsel and advice, and so that the natives may see and\r\n    understand your high estimation of them; for seeing this, and the\r\n    great reverence of the soldiers toward them, they themselves will\r\n    hold the religious in great respect. This will be of great moment,\r\n    so that, when the religious shall understand their language,\r\n    or have interpreters through whom they may make them understand\r\n    our holy Catholic faith, the Indians shall put entire faith in\r\n    them; since you are aware that the chief thing sought after by\r\n    his Majesty is the increase of our holy Catholic faith, and the\r\n    salvation of the souls of those infidels. [155]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1566, a petition was sent from Cebu to the King of Spain, bearing\r\nthe signatures of Martin de Goiti, Guido de Labezari, and the other\r\nleading officers under Legaspi, setting forth, among other requests,\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n\r\n    That the Moros, \"because they try to prevent our trade with the\r\n    natives and preach to them the religion of Mohammed,\" may be\r\n    enslaved and lose their property. That slave traffic be allowed,\r\n    \"that the Spaniards may make use of them, as do the chiefs and\r\n    natives of those regions, both in mines and other works that\r\n    offer themselves.\" [156]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a letter addressed to Legaspi King Philip II said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We have also been petitioned in your behalf concerning the Moro\r\n    Islands in that land, and how those men come to trade and carry on\r\n    commerce, hindering the preaching of the holy gospel and disturbing\r\n    you. We give you permission to make such Moros slaves and to seize\r\n    their property. You are warned that you can make them slaves only\r\n    if the said Moros are such by birth and choice, and if they come\r\n    to preach their Mohammedan doctrine or to make war against you or\r\n    against the Indians, who are our subjects and in our royal service.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a letter addressed to King Philip II Bishop Salazar writes, June\r\n27, 1588, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The second point is that, in the Island of Mindanao, which is\r\n    subject to your Majesty, and for many years has paid you tribute,\r\n    the law of Mohammed has been publicly proclaimed, for somewhat more\r\n    than three years, by preachers from Bruney and Ternate who have\r\n    come there--some of them even, it is believed, having come from\r\n    Mecca. They have erected and are now building mosques, and the\r\n    boys are being circumcised, and there is a school where they are\r\n    taught the Quran. I was promptly informed of this, and urged the\r\n    president to supply a remedy therefor at once, in order that that\r\n    pestilential fire should not spread in these islands. I could not\r\n    persuade them to go, and thus the hatred of Christianity is there;\r\n    and we are striving no more to remedy this than if the matter did\r\n    not concern us. Such are the calamities and miseries to which we\r\n    have come, and the punishments which God inflicts upon us. [157]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn drawing a contract with Capt. Esteban Rodriguez de Figueroa, in\r\n1591, for the pacification and conquest of Mindanao, the Governor\r\nand Captain-General Gomez Perez Dasmariñas makes the following\r\ndeclarations:\r\n\r\n\r\n    His Majesty orders and charges me, by his royal instructions and\r\n    decrees, as the most worthy and important thing in these islands,\r\n    to strive for the propagation of our holy faith among the natives\r\n    herein, their conversion to the knowledge of the true God, and\r\n    their reduction to the obedience of His holy church and of the\r\n    king, our sovereign. * * *\r\n\r\n    Moreover, the Island of Mindanao is so fertile and well inhabited,\r\n    and teeming with Indian settlements, wherein to plant the faith, *\r\n     * * and is rich in gold mines and placers, and in wax, cinnamon,\r\n    and other valuable drugs. And although the said island has been\r\n    seen, discussed, and explored, * * * no effort has been made\r\n    to enter and reduce it, nor has it been pacified or furnished\r\n    with instruction or justice--quite to the contrary being, at\r\n    the present time, hostile and refusing obedience to his Majesty;\r\n    and no tribute, or very little, is being collected. * * *\r\n\r\n    Besides the above facts, by delaying the pacification of the said\r\n    island greater wrongs, to the offense and displeasure of God and\r\n    of his Majesty, are resulting daily; for I am informed that the\r\n    king of that island has made all who were paying tribute to his\r\n    Majesty tributary to himself by force of arms, and after putting\r\n    many of them to death while doing it; so that now each Indian pays\r\n    him one tae [158] of gold. I am also told that he destroyed and\r\n    broke into pieces, with many insults, a cross that he found, when\r\n    told that it was adored by the Christians; and that in Magindanao,\r\n    the capital and residence of the said king, are Bornean Indians\r\n    who teach and preach publicly the false doctrine of Mohammed,\r\n    and have mosques; besides these, there are also people from\r\n    Ternate--gunners, armorers, and powder-makers, all engaged in\r\n    their trades--who at divers times have killed many Spaniards when\r\n    the latter were going to collect the tribute, * * * without our\r\n    being able to mete out punishment, because of lack of troops. By\r\n    reason of the facts above recited, and because all of the said\r\n    wrongs and troubles will cease with the said pacification; and,\r\n    when it is made, we are sure that the surrounding kingdoms of\r\n    Bruney, Sulu, Java, and other provinces, will become obedient\r\n    to his Majesty: therefore, in order that the said island may be\r\n    pacified, subdued, and settled, and the gospel preached to the\r\n    natives; and that justice may be established among them, and they\r\n    be taught to live in a civilized manner, and to recognize God and\r\n    His holy law, I have tried to entrust the said pacification to\r\n    a person of such character that he may be entrusted with it. [159]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is plain, therefore, that the sentiment of the times justified war\r\non the Moros for the cause of religion alone, and that, though the\r\nprimary object was conquest, no doubt the religious motives of the\r\nSpaniards were stronger than their desire to check piracy. But, of all\r\nthe Christian nations, the Spaniards should have been most aware of the\r\ntenacity, determination, and courage with which the Mohammedans defend\r\ntheir faith, and the Sulus were no exception to the rule, for they had\r\nbeen born and reared in that religion for more than four generations.\r\n\r\nA wiser policy on the part of Governor Sandé would have either let the\r\nMoros of Sulu and Mindanao alone, or effected a complete reduction of\r\nthe state of Sulu and immediate occupation of the coasts of Mindanao\r\nwith strong forces; for it appears from all accounts that neither\r\nthe Sulus nor the Magindanaos were as strongly organized then as they\r\nwere a generation later, and either alliance or war should have been\r\neasier then than afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards at that time were excellent warriors. Their conquests\r\nof the Bisayan Islands and Luzon were rapid and brilliant, but it\r\nappears that the system of government which they inaugurated there\r\nmet with distinct failure the minute it was extended to the more\r\norganized communities and the greater forces they encountered in the\r\nsouth. The Sulus, on the other hand, fought in the defense of their\r\nnational independence and religion, and never found life too dear\r\nto sacrifice in that cause. They resented the treatment of Spain,\r\nand in their rage and desire for revenge built stronger forts and\r\nfleets and became fiercer pirates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE OF BATARA SHAH TANGAH\r\n\r\nPangiran must have died about 1579 and was followed by Sultan\r\nBatara Shah Tangah, who is in all probability the Paquian or Paguian\r\nTindig of the Spanish writers. Tangah's claim to the sultanate was\r\nstrongly contested by his cousin, Abdasaolan [160] who ruled over\r\nBasilan. The latter attacked Jolo with a strong force, but failed\r\nto reduce its forts. Tangah, however, felt insecure and went to\r\nManila to request Governor Sandé's aid and returned to Sulu with\r\ntwo Spanish armed boats (caracoas). [161] Abdasaolan, whose power\r\nhad in the meantime increased, prepared for defense and watched for\r\nthe advance of the Sultan's boat. Finding that the caracoas were at\r\na considerable distance from the Sultan's boat he manned two light\r\nsalisipans [162] with a strong force and dispatched them, with speed\r\nto intercept Tangah. The Sultan's party was completely surprised,\r\nand in the fight that resulted Tangah was killed. On reaching Jolo\r\nthe Spanish forces attacked the town. The Sulus fought valiantly,\r\nbut their fort was reduced. The officers in command of the caracoas\r\nassembled the people and had Raja Bungsu, who was wounded in the fight,\r\nelected sultan to succeed Tangah. The full title of Bungsu was \"The\r\nSultan Muwallil Wasit Bungsu.\" [163]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIGUEROA'S EXPEDITION AGAINST MINDANAO\r\n\r\nIn 1596 Capt. Esteban Rodriguez led an expedition into Mindanao,\r\nfor its conquest and pacification.\r\n\r\nIt is maintained that he proceeded up the Mindanao River as far as\r\nBwayan, the capital of the upper Mindanao Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Don Esteban Rodriguez prepared men and ships, and what else was\r\n    necessary for the enterprise, and with some galleys, galleots,\r\n    frigates, vireys, [164] barangays, [164] and lapis, [165] set out\r\n    with two hundred and fourteen Spaniards for the Island of Mindanao,\r\n    in February of the same year, of 1596. He took Capt. Juan de la\r\n    Xara as his master-of-camp, and some religious of the Society\r\n    of Jesus to give instruction, as well as many natives for the\r\n    service of the camp and fleet.\r\n\r\n    He reached Mindanao River after a good voyage, where the first\r\n    settlements, named Tampakan and Lumakan, both hostile to the\r\n    people of Bwayan, received him peacefully and in a friendly\r\n    manner, and joined his fleet. They were altogether about six\r\n    thousand men. Without delay they advanced about 8 leagues\r\n    farther up the river against Bwayan, the principal settlement\r\n    of the island, where its greatest chief had fortified himself\r\n    on many sides. Arrived at the settlement, the fleet cast anchor\r\n    and immediately landed a large proportion of the troops with\r\n    their arms. But before reaching the houses and fort, and while\r\n    going through some thickets [cacatal] [166] near the shore, they\r\n    encountered some of the men of Bwayan, who were coming to meet\r\n    them with their kampilan, [167] carazas [168] and other weapons,\r\n    and who attacked them on various sides. The latter [i.e., the\r\n    Spaniards and their allies], on account of the swampiness of the\r\n    place and the denseness of the thickets [cacatal], could not act\r\n    unitedly as the occasion demanded, although the master-of-camp and\r\n    the captains that led them exerted themselves to keep the troops\r\n    together and to encourage them to face the natives. Meanwhile\r\n    Governor Esteban Rodriguez de Figueroa was watching events from\r\n    his flagship, but not being able to endure the confusion of his\r\n    men, seized his weapons and hastened ashore with three or four\r\n    companions and a servant who carried his helmet in order that he\r\n    might be less impeded in his movements. But as he was crossing\r\n    a part of the thickets [cacatal] where the fight was waging,\r\n    a hostile Indian stepped out unseen from one side and dealt the\r\n    governor a blow on the head with his kampilan that stretched\r\n    him on the ground badly wounded. [169] The governor's followers\r\n    cut the Mindanao to pieces and carried the governor back to the\r\n    camp. Shortly after the master-of-camp, Juan de la Xara, withdrew\r\n    his troops to the fleet, leaving behind several Spaniards who had\r\n    fallen in the encounter. The governor did not regain consciousness,\r\n    for the wound was very severe, and died next day. The fleet after\r\n    that loss and failure left that place, and descended the river\r\n    to Tampakan, where it anchored among the friendly inhabitants\r\n    and their settlements.\r\n\r\n    The master-of-camp, Juan de la Xara, had himself chosen by the\r\n    fleet as successor in the government and enterprise. He built a\r\n    fort with arigues [170] and palms near Tampakan, and founded a\r\n    Spanish settlement to which he gave the name of Murcia. He began\r\n    to make what arrangements he deemed best, in order to establish\r\n    himself and run things independently of, and without acknowledging\r\n    the governor of Manila, without whose intervention and assistance\r\n    this enterprise could not be continued. [171]\r\n\r\n\r\nBwayan was 30 miles up the river and 25 miles above Magindanao\r\nor Kotabato where Bwisan, the Sultan of Magindanao, was strongly\r\nfortified. It is difficult to believe that Rodriguez could advance so\r\nfar even with a small scouting party. A careful review of the Spanish\r\nreports referring to these early campaigns in Mindanao indicates that\r\nBwayan has been erroneously used in place of Magindanao, the ancient\r\ncapital of the sultanate of Magindanao.\r\n\r\nBent on the conquest of Mindanao, Governor Tello prepared another\r\nexpedition under Gen. Juan Ronquillo [172] and dispatched it by the\r\nway of Cebu. At Caldera, it was joined by the fleet of Mindanao and\r\nthe whole force proceeded east in the direction of the Mindanao River,\r\non the 6th of February, 1597. Captain Chaves arrived with his frigates\r\nat the river on the 8th of January. In a battle fought at Simway\r\nto capture Moro vessels going to seek aid from Ternate he had a leg\r\ncut off and received a shot in the helmet above the ear. Ronquillo\r\narrived at the mouth of the river on February 21, and on the 17th of\r\nApril he engaged a Moro fleet with 40 arquebusiers and defeated them,\r\nkilling a number of their brave men and some Ternatans without losing\r\nany of his men except 5 Bisayans. Leaving a guard of 34 men under\r\nChaves at the fort of Tampakan he advanced up the river with a force\r\nof 230 sailors and gunners. The enemy retired behind some parapets as\r\nsoon as the artillery opened upon them, and brought some artillery\r\nto bear on the flagship (one of the galleys), but could not retard\r\nthe Spanish advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I answered their fire with so great readiness,\" said Ronquillo in\r\n    his report, \"that I forced them to withdraw their artillery. But,\r\n    as if they were goblins, they remained here behind a bush or a\r\n    tree, firing at us without being seen.\" Reinforced by the chief\r\n    of the hill tribes, Lumakan, with 500 natives, Ronquillo resumed\r\n    the fighting after the delay of a few days. \"Finally,\" continued\r\n    Ronquillo, \"I planted my battery of eight pieces somewhat over\r\n    100 paces from the fort. Although I battered the fort hotly, I\r\n    could not effect a breach through which to make an assault. All\r\n    the damage that I did them by day, they repaired by night. * * *\r\n\r\n    \"I was very short of ammunition, for I had only 3,000 arquebus\r\n    bullets left, and very few cannon balls; and both would be spent\r\n    in one day's fighting, during which, should we not gain the fort,\r\n    we would be lost--and with no power to defend ourselves while\r\n    withdrawing our artillery and camp. * * *\r\n\r\n    \"I reconnoitered the fort and its situation, for it is located\r\n    at the entrance of a lagoon, thus having only water at the back,\r\n    and swampy and marshy ground at the sides. It has a frontage of\r\n    more than 1,000 paces, is furnished with very good transversals,\r\n    and is well supplied with artillery and arquebuses. Moreover it\r\n    has a ditch of water more than 4 brazas [173] wide and 2 deep,\r\n    and thus there was a space of dry ground of only 15 paces where it\r\n    was possible to attack; and this space was bravely defended, and\r\n    with the greatest force of the enemy. The inner parts were water,\r\n    where they sailed in vessels, while we had no footing at all.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Again, I reflected that those who had awaited us so long, had\r\n    waited with the determination to die in defense of the fort; and\r\n    if they should see the contest ending unfavorably for them, no one\r\n    would prevent their flight. Further, if they awaited the assault\r\n    it would cost me the greater part of my remaining ammunition,\r\n    and my best men; while, if the enemy fled, nothing would be\r\n    accomplished, but on the contrary a long, tedious, and costly\r\n    war would be entered upon. Hence, with the opinion and advice of\r\n    the captains, I negotiated for peace, and told them that I would\r\n    admit them to friendship under the following conditions:\r\n\r\n    \"First, that first and foremost they must offer homage to his\r\n    Majesty, and pay something as recognition\" (a gold chain). Second,\r\n    \"that all the natives who had been taken from the Pintados Islands\r\n    [Bisayan Islands] last year, must be restored.\" Third, \"that they\r\n    must break the peace and confederation made with the people of\r\n    Ternate, and must not admit the latter into their country.\" Fourth,\r\n    \"that they must be friends with Danganlibor and Lumakan, * * *\r\n    and must not make war on their vassals.\" Fifth, \"that all the\r\n    chiefs must go to live in their old villages.\" [174]\r\n\r\n\r\nRonquillo later reported the place indefensible and was authorized\r\nto retire to Caldera.\r\n\r\nRonquillo must have advanced as far as the settlement of Kalangnan\r\nor possibly Magindanao (Kotabato), the capital of Sultan Bwisan. The\r\nreport he rendered relative to the country, its people and chiefs,\r\nis very interesting and an excerpt of the same is herewith quoted\r\nbecause of its bearing on conditions throughout Moroland:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The leading chiefs collect tribute from their vassals. * * * These\r\n    Indians are not like those in Luzon, but are accustomed to power\r\n    and sovereignty. Some collect five or six thousand tributes. * * *\r\n\r\n    Hitherto it has not been possible to tell your lordship anything\r\n    certain of this country except that it will be of but little\r\n    advantage to his Majesty, but a source of great expense. It has\r\n    far fewer inhabitants than was reported, and all are very poor,\r\n    so that their breakfast consists only in cleaning their arms,\r\n    and their work in using them, and not in cultivating the land,\r\n    which is low and swampy in this river. There is no chief who can\r\n    raise 20 taes of gold. Rice is very scarce; in the hills is found\r\n    a small amount, which is used for food by the chiefs only. There\r\n    are some swine, and a few fowls that are very cunning, and less\r\n    fruit. [175]\r\n\r\n\r\nThese early expeditions of the Spaniards against the Moros undoubtedly\r\naroused in the latter a great desire for vengeance. The forces the\r\nSpaniards sent to conquer Mindanao and Sulu were very small. Such\r\nforces would have been strong enough to reduce any island of the\r\nBisayan group, or even Luzon, but against the Moros they proved\r\ninsufficient and inadequate. They however succeeded in provoking\r\nbitter hostilities and marked the beginning of a long period of terror\r\nand bloodshed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMORO RAIDS [176]\r\n\r\nIn 1599 combined Moro fleets invaded and plundered the coasts of the\r\nBisayan Islands, Cebu, Negros, and Panay.\r\n\r\nCaptain Paches, who was in command of the fort of Caldera, attacked\r\nthe northern coast of the Island of Sulu. After landing at some point,\r\nit was observed by the Sulus that his fuses were wet and that his\r\nguns could not fire well. They then rushed his position, killed him,\r\nand dispersed his forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following year saw the return of a larger and still more\r\n    dreadful expedition. The people of Panay abandoned their towns\r\n    and fled into the mountains under the belief that these terrible\r\n    attacks had been inspired by the Spaniards. To check these\r\n    pirates, Juan Gallinato, with a force of 200 Spaniards, was sent\r\n    against Sulu, but like so many expeditions that followed his,\r\n    he accomplished nothing. * * * \"From this time until the present\r\n    day\" (about the year 1800), wrote Zuñiga, \"these Moros have not\r\n    ceased to infest our colonies; innumerable are the Indians they\r\n    have captured, the towns they have looted, the rancherias they\r\n    have destroyed, and the vessels they have taken. It seems as\r\n    if God has preserved them for vengeance on the Spaniards that\r\n    they have not been able to subject them in two hundred years,\r\n    in spite of the expeditions sent against them, the armaments\r\n    sent almost every year to pursue them. In a very little while\r\n    we conquered all the islands of the Philippines, but the little\r\n    Island of Sulu, a part of Mindanao, and the other islands nearby,\r\n    we have not been able to subjugate to this day.\" [177]\r\n\r\n\r\nGallinatos's expedition occurred in 1602. [178] After three months of\r\nprotracted fighting at Jolo, he was unable to reduce the fortifications\r\nof the town and retired to Panay.\r\n\r\nIn 1616 a large Sulu fleet destroyed Pantao in the Camarines and the\r\nshipyards of Cavite and exacted large sums for the ransom of Spanish\r\nprisoners. Moro fleets in 1625 sacked Katbalogan in Samar.\r\n\r\nIn 1628 Governor Tavora sent an expedition to Sulu under Cristobol\r\nde Lugo. Cristobol disembarked half of his infantry, sacked the town\r\nof Jolo, set part of it on fire and sailed back to Cebu.\r\n\r\nIn 1629 the Moros raided Samar and Leyte. In 1630 an armada composed\r\nof 70 vessels and having 350 Spanish and 2,000 native soldiers, under\r\nLorenzo de Olaso Ochotegui, arrived at Jolo. Olaso misdirected his\r\nforces and, advancing too near to the wall of the fort, was wounded\r\nin his side and fell. He was rescued by the officers who followed him,\r\nbut the troops were demoralized and retired. The expedition, however,\r\nlanded at various points on the coast and burned and pillaged small\r\nsettlements. [179]\r\n\r\nIn the same year P. Gutierrez came to Mindanao on a mission to\r\nCorralat. [180] On his return he met Tuan Baluka, wife of Raja Bungsu,\r\nat Zamboanga. Baluka urged P. Gutierrez to delay his departure from\r\nZamboanga and warned him of the danger of meeting the Sulu expedition\r\nunder Datu Ache. He, however, continued on his way and was overtaken by\r\nDatu Ache's force, but on account of the message and flag he delivered\r\nto Ache from Tuan Baluka, he was allowed to proceed safely.\r\n\r\nFor some time the Jesuits had been urging upon the Philippine\r\nGovernment the occupation of the southern coast of Mindanao. This\r\nmeant an advance into the enemy's camp and a bloody struggle for\r\nsupremacy in the southern seas. The consequences of such a step\r\nwere foreseen by the Government and very few governors would have\r\ndared undertake such a grave responsibility. In 1635, Governor Juan\r\nCerezo de Salamanca was petitioned by the Jesuits to establish an\r\nadvance post of the Spanish forces at Zamboanga for the protection of\r\nmissionaries and the Christians who had to navigate in the southern\r\nseas. Salamanca granted their request and sent Capt. Juan de Chaves,\r\nwho disembarked at Zamboanga on the 6th of April, 1635. The force under\r\nCaptain Chaves consisted of 300 Spanish and 1,000 native soldiers. In\r\nJune they began the construction of a stone fort on a plan designed by\r\nthe Jesuit missionary P. Melchor de Vera, who was an expert engineer.\r\n\r\nThe advantages to be derived from the position of this garrison\r\nwere demonstrated before the year was over. As a piratical fleet\r\nwas returning from Cuyo, Mindoro, and the Kalamian Islands, the\r\nfavorable opportunity was watched for, and as the two divisions of\r\nthe fleet separated, the Spanish forces pursued Corralat's pirates\r\nand dealt them a deadly blow in the neighborhood of Point Flechas,\r\nkilling about 300 Moros and saving 120 Christian captives. [181]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST SPANISH CONQUEST AND OCCUPATION OF SULU, 1635-1646\r\n\r\nGen. Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera relieved Salamanca before the end\r\nof the year 1635 and continued the same policy with additional vigor\r\nand great ability. He quickly resolved upon attacking the Moros in\r\ntheir own strongholds, and thought that by crushing their power at\r\nhome he would be able to put an end to their piratical raids.\r\n\r\nHe arrived at Zamboanga February 22, 1636, proceeded first to Mindanao,\r\nfought Corralat and destroyed some of his forts and sailed back to\r\nManila. [182] Corcuera returned to Zamboanga in December, 1637,\r\nand prepared for an expedition against Sulu. On January 1, 1638,\r\nhe embarked for Sulu with 600 Spanish soldiers, 1,000 native troops,\r\nand many volunteers and adventurers. He had 80 vessels all told and\r\narrived at Jolo on the 4th. [183]\r\n\r\nAnticipating an invasion, Sultan Bungsu had strengthened his\r\ngarrisons and called for aid and reënforcements from Basilan, Tapul,\r\nand Tawi-tawi. On his arrival Corcuera found the town well fortified\r\nand the enemy strongly intrenched. The Moros were well disciplined\r\nand had a well organized guard. The forts occupied strategic points\r\nand were strongly defended; the trenches were well laid, and the\r\nMoros shot well and fought fearlessly.\r\n\r\nCorcuera besieged the town with all his forces and attacked it\r\nrepeatedly and valiantly using powerful artillery, but he could not\r\nreduce it. Several efforts to tunnel the walls or effect a breach in\r\nthem by mines were frustrated by the vigilance and intrepidity of\r\nthe Sulus. The siege lasted three months and a half, at the end of\r\nwhich time the Sulus evacuated the town and retired to the neighboring\r\nhills, where they intended to make the next stand. Corcuera, taking\r\npossession of the town, reconstructed its forts and established three\r\nposts, one on the hill, one at the river, and one on the sandbank in\r\nfront of the town. The garrison he established there consisted of 200\r\nSpanish soldiers and an equal number of Pampangans, under the command\r\nof Capt. Ginés Ros and Gaspar de Morales. In May Corcuera returned to\r\nManila with all the triumph of a conqueror, leaving Gen. Pedro Almonte,\r\nthe senior officer next to himself in command of the expedition, as\r\ngovernor of Zamboanga and Ternate and chief of the forces in the south.\r\n\r\nSoon after the establishment of the Jolo garrison, the Sulus under Datu\r\nAche attacked the soldiers in the quarry and killed a few Spaniards\r\nand captured 40 Chinese and Negroes (galley slaves). This and other\r\ndepredations committed by the Sulus from time to time, some of which\r\nwere provoked by the ill behavior of the Spanish officers and troops,\r\nforced Almonte in June, 1639, to come over to Sulu and take the field\r\na second time. With 3 captains and 1,200 Spanish and native soldiers,\r\nhe marched over the island, attacked the Sulus in their homes, burned\r\ntheir houses and killed every man he could reach. It is said that he\r\nhung 500 heads on the trees, liberated 112 Christian captives, and\r\ncaptured quantities of arms. When he asked the Gimbaha Sulus (at one\r\nof the settlements of Parang) to submit to the sovereignty of Spain,\r\nthey refused to recognize his authority, challenged his forces,\r\nand fought him desperately. They wore helmets and armor and used\r\nspears and swords. On one occasion, Captain Cepeda engaged them in\r\nbattle and returned with 300 captives, leaving on the field 400 dead,\r\na fearful lesson to those who survived. Cepeda lost 7 Spaniards and\r\n20 natives only, but he had a large number wounded.\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with the havoc he wrought on the Island of Sulu, and\r\ndesiring to follow and catch the fugitive sultan, Almonte invaded\r\nthe other large islands and followed the sultan and the datus all\r\nover the Archipelago. At Tawi-tawi, however, he met with a reverse,\r\nand the captain who led the expedition returned with considerable loss.\r\n\r\nSoon after Almonte's departure, the Sulus who had fled returned\r\nand lost no time or opportunity in harassing the garrison. Several\r\npiratical excursions invaded the Bisayas and Camarines. Soon Dutch\r\nvessels, invited by Sulu emissaries sent to Java, appeared in the\r\nvicinity of Zamboanga and Jolo and threatened the Spanish garrison\r\nand incited the Moros to resist the Spaniards and attack their\r\nforces. Anticipating trouble with the Dutch, and foreseeing the\r\ndanger of maintaining a garrison at Jolo under the circumstances,\r\nthe Spaniards planned to evacuate the town. Accordingly on the 14th\r\nof April, 1646, they left Jolo. Before withdrawing their troops,\r\nthey managed to make a treaty with the Sulus, which took the form of\r\nan alliance both offensive and defensive. The purpose of the treaty\r\nwas declared to be the maintenance of peace between both parties and\r\nmutual aid against foreign enemies. In case of assistance against a\r\nforeign nation, the expenses of the war were to be defrayed by the\r\nparty requesting aid. The Spanish Government recognized the supreme\r\nauthority of the Sultan of Sulu from Tawi-tawi to Tutup and Pagahak,\r\nreserving sovereignty rights for the King of Spain over Tapul, Siasi,\r\nBalangingi, and Pangutaran only. In return for the evacuation of Jolo,\r\nand as a sign of brotherhood, the Sultan of Sulu promised to send\r\nyearly to Zamboanga three boats, 8 fathoms long, full of rice, and to\r\nallow the Jesuit priests to come to Jolo unmolested. Other provisions\r\nwere inserted in the treaty for the exchange and redemption of slaves,\r\ncriminals, or others who happened to run away from Zamboanga to Sulu\r\nand vice versa.\r\n\r\nThis treaty did not remain in force for any great length of time,\r\nfor we hear again in 1647 that the Sulus invaded the Bisayas and\r\nharassed the vicinity of Zamboanga.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSULU SUPREMACY IN THE ARCHIPELAGO, 1647-1850\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCCESSORS OF BUNGSU\r\n\r\nBungsu had a very long reign marked with reverses and misfortunes. He\r\ndied before 1640, and was succeeded by Sultan Nasirud Din II and Sultan\r\nSalahud Din Karamat. The latter was known to the Spanish writers as\r\nBaktial, which was his Sulu name before the sultanate. During the\r\nreign of Karamat the Philippines were threatened by a Chinese invasion\r\nfrom the north and by war with Holland, and the government, under the\r\ncircumstances, decided to abandon Zamboanga and the Moluccas. This\r\npurpose they carried out in 1663. In the days of Karamat the Sulus\r\nbecame very active and made many raids in various directions. The\r\ndecline of Spain's political power and her inactivity in the century\r\nthat followed the evacuation of Zamboanga caused obscurity in the\r\nSpanish records of the history of Sulu and Mindanao. The events of\r\nthis century are, with few exceptions, lacking in significance and\r\ninterest. [184]\r\n\r\nThe sultans who followed Karamat are, in the order of their succession,\r\nShahabud Din, Mustafa Shafi`ud Din, Badarud Din I, Nasarud Din,\r\nand Alimud Din I, better known as Amirul Mu'minin (Ferdinand I of\r\nSulu). The first three were brothers, the sons of Karamat, while the\r\nlast two were the sons of Badarud Din.\r\n\r\nIn 1718 Governor Bustamante reoccupied Zamboanga for the purpose\r\nof waging war against piracy. \"The citadel (Fuerza del Pilar) was\r\nrebuilt on an elaborate plan under the direction of the engineer, Juan\r\nSicarra. Besides the usual barracks, storehouses, and arsenals, there\r\nwere, within the walls, a church, a hospital, and quarters for the\r\nPampangan soldiers. Sixty-one cannon were mounted upon the defenses.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1725, a Chinese named Ki Kuan was sent to Manila to arrange for\r\npeace and returned with two Spanish commissioners, who made a treaty\r\nwith the sultan of Sulu providing for trade between Manila and Jolo,\r\nthe return or ransom of captives, and the ceding to Spain of the\r\nIsland of Basilan. Notwithstanding this treaty Moro raids continued\r\neither by toleration of the sultan and datus or at their instigation.\r\n\r\nIn 1730 a brother of the sultan commanded an expedition of 31\r\nvessels, which attacked the fort of Taytay and ravaged the coast of\r\nPalawan. Another expedition spent nearly a whole year cruising and\r\ndestroying among the Bisayas.\r\n\r\nIn retaliation a large Spanish fleet united at Zamboanga and, under\r\nIgnacio de Irebri and Manuel del Rosal, invaded the shores of Sulu and\r\nravaged and burned some settlements. At Bwal they found the settlement\r\nwell protected and extensively fortified, so they contented themselves\r\nwith destroying some plantations and burning outlying houses. At\r\nTapul considerable damage was inflicted. A force of 600 disembarked,\r\ndispersed the Sulus, burned their settlements, destroyed many farms,\r\nthe salt works, and many boats, and returned to Zamboanga. In 1732\r\nsimilar raids were made and hostilities continued until 1737.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREIGN OF SULTAN ALIMUD DIN I\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest events in the reign of Alimud Din I was his\r\nratification of the treaty of 1737. The sultan was represented\r\nin Manila by Datu Mohammed Ismael and Datu Ja`far, who signed the\r\ndocument. The treaty was drawn in January, 1737, by Governor-General\r\nFernando Valdés y Tamon and contained five articles.\r\n\r\nThe first article declared the determination of both parties to\r\npreserve permanent peace between the two states, all differences or\r\ngrievances to be settled amicably, and hostilities between subjects\r\nor vassals to be strictly prohibited and punished; the second provided\r\nfor alliance and mutual aid against any foreign foe. European nations\r\nwere, however, excluded from the provisions of this article; the third\r\nprovided for free trade between the two states, restricted by the use\r\nof passports to be issued by superior authority; the fourth provided\r\nthat each state should be held responsible for all infractions of\r\nthe peace committed by its subjects and should be bound to punish the\r\nsame and make proper amends to the proper party; the fifth provided\r\nfor the exchange of captives and return of all church images and\r\nornaments in the possession of the Sulus.\r\n\r\nTo all appearances Alimud Din I was a man of peace and a reformer. He\r\nkept his part of the treaty faithfully and piracy was actually\r\nsuppressed during the whole period in which he held the reins of\r\ngovernment. He revised the Sulu code of laws and system of justice. He\r\ncaused to be translated into Sulu parts of the Quran and several Arabic\r\ntexts on law and religion. He strongly urged the people to observe\r\nfaithfully their religion and the ordained five daily prayers. He even\r\nwent so far as to prescribe punishment for failure to observe this\r\nrule. He wanted all pandita to learn Arabic and prepared Arabic-Sulu\r\nvocabularies as a preliminary step to making the Arabic the official\r\nlanguage of the state. He coined money, organized a small army,\r\nand tried to establish a navy. His name is foremost in the memory\r\nof the Sulus, partly because of his able administration and partly\r\non account of the fact that he is the grandfather of all the present\r\nprincipal datus of the Sulus.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1746, a special commission from Manila carried to\r\nAlimud Din a letter written by King Philip V in 1744, requesting the\r\nadmission of Jesuit missionaries to Jolo with permission to preach\r\nthe Christian religion to the Sulus. The sultan entertained the\r\ncommission very hospitably and gave in their honor a royal reception\r\nand a review of the troops. A council was held in which the sultan\r\nconferred with the leading datus of Sulu and granted the request of\r\nKing Philip V. He further authorized the building of a church and\r\nrecommended the erection of a fort at some convenient locality for\r\nthe safe protection of the missionaries. In return for this favor he\r\nrequested that the Spanish Government give him, as an aid in building\r\na navy, the sum of P6,000, 12 piculs [185] of gunpowder, 12 piculs\r\nof nails, and 1 picul of steel. This, he represented, was needed to\r\nenable him to suppress piracy and to check the depredations of his\r\nenemies in Borneo. This request the Spanish Government granted, and\r\nJesuit missionaries entered Jolo, translated the catechism into Sulu,\r\nand distributed it freely among the people.\r\n\r\nThe liberties exercised by the Jesuits in their endeavor to proselyte\r\nthe Sulus and the strong friendship the sultan manifested toward them\r\ncreated great dissatisfaction among the people, and an opposition party\r\nwas formed, under the leadership of Prince Bantilan, for the purpose of\r\nexpelling the missionaries and deposing Alimud Din. Bantilan was the\r\nson of Sultan Shahabud Din and had as much right to the sultanate of\r\nSulu as any son of Sultan Badarud Din. After the death of the latter\r\nthe sultanate should have reverted to the line of Shahabud Din; but it\r\nhappens very often that the sons of the last sultan are either older\r\nthan those of the former or meet with more favor and are, as a rule,\r\nsupported by the majority of the council of datus; thus the regular\r\norder of descent changes in favor of the stronger person. Probably\r\nBantilan was preceded by both Nasarud Din and Alimud Din for some\r\nsuch reason as the above. This he resented at heart, but suppressed\r\nhis resentment until this favorable opportunity offered itself. He\r\nthen headed the opposition to the sultan and the missionaries and won\r\nthe majority of the datus and panditas to his side. Hostilities soon\r\nincreased and civil war was imminent. In an effort to assassinate\r\nthe sultan, Bantilan thrust a spear at Alimud Din and inflicted\r\na severe wound in his side or thigh. During the disturbances and\r\nconfusion which followed it became dangerous for the missionaries\r\nto remain at Jolo. One of the ministers of the sultan provided them\r\nwith a salisipan in which they escaped without harm and withdrew to\r\nZamboanga. This occurred late in 1748. Overpowered, disheartened,\r\nand grieved, Alimud Din left Jolo with his family and numerous escort\r\nand came to Zamboanga, seeking the aid of Spain against Bantilan. The\r\nlatter proclaimed himself sultan with the title of Mu`izzud Din,\r\n[186] strengthened the defenses of his capital, and waged war on all\r\nthe datus who had supported Alimud Din. His power soon became supreme,\r\nand he reigned with a strong hand.\r\n\r\nAt Zamboanga Alimud Din is said to have given the officers many\r\npresents and offered the Governor Zacharias 40 male Papuan slaves, who\r\nwere well dressed. Zacharias, unreasonably prejudiced and distrustful,\r\nsuspected some ill design and refused the present. Not receiving\r\nsufficient attention and consideration at Zamboanga, Alimud Din asked\r\nleave to go to Manila. This granted, he sailed and arrived at Cavite\r\nJanuary 2, 1749. At Manila \"he was received with all the pomp and\r\nhonor due to a prince of high rank. A house for his entertainment\r\nand his retinue of seventy persons was prepared in Binondo. A public\r\nentrance was arranged which took place some fifteen days after he\r\nreached the city. Triumphal arches were erected across the streets,\r\nwhich were lined with more than 2,000 native militia under arms. The\r\nsultan was publicly received in the hall of the Audiencia, where\r\nthe governor promised to lay his case before the King of Spain. The\r\nsultan was showered with presents, which included chains of gold,\r\nfine garments, precious gems, and gold canes, while the Government\r\nsustained the expense of his household.\" [187]\r\n\r\nFollowing this reception, steps were taken for his conversion. His\r\nspiritual advisers cited to him the example of the Emperor Constantine\r\nwhose conversion enabled him to effect triumphant conquests over\r\nhis enemies. Under these representations Alimud Din expressed his\r\ndesire for baptism. The governor-general, who at this time was a\r\npriest, the bishop of Nueva Segovia, was very anxious that the rite\r\nshould take place; but this was opposed by his spiritual superior,\r\nthe archbishop of Manila, who, with some others, entertained doubts\r\nas to the sincerity of the Sultan's profession.\r\n\r\n\"In order to accomplish his baptism, the governor sent him to his own\r\ndiocese, where at Paniki, on the 29th of April, 1750, the ceremony\r\ntook place with great solemnity. On the return of the party to Manila,\r\nthe sultan was received with great pomp, and in his honor were held\r\ngames, theatrical representations, fireworks, and bull fights. This\r\nwas the high-water mark of the sultan's popularity. [188]\r\n\r\nAt his baptism the sultan received the name of Ferdinand, and Spanish\r\nauthors often referred to him as \"Don Fernando de Alimud Din I,\r\nCatholic Sultan of Joló.\" It is further stated that two datus and\r\nfive of his principal followers were baptized. The crown prince,\r\nRaja Muda Mohammed Israel and his sister Fatimah attended school in\r\nManila and learned Spanish manners and customs.\r\n\r\nA year and a half passed and no action was taken by the authorities\r\nto restore Alimud Din. In the meantime Bantilan's fleets were busy\r\nravaging and pillaging the Bisayas. In July, 1750, a new governor, the\r\nmarquis of Obando (Francisco José de Obando) arrived in Manila. After\r\nsome deliberation he resolved to reinstate Alimud Din and punish\r\nBantilan and his pirates. [189] Accordingly, on May 19, 1751, the\r\nsultan and his retinue were sent on board the Spanish frigate San\r\nFernando and were convoyed by a squadron composed of seven war vessels\r\nunder the command of Field Marshal Ramon de Abad. Falling in with\r\nbad weather off the shore of Mindoro, the San Fernando was disabled\r\nand made for Kalapan. The squadron, however, continued its voyage\r\nuninterrupted to Jolo, arriving there on the 26th of June. After some\r\ndesultory fighting, Abad arrived at an understanding with the Sulus\r\nand arranged for Datu Asin to come to Zamboanga with sufficient boats\r\nto escort the sultan back to Jolo.\r\n\r\nThe sultan in the meantime stopped at Iloilo where he changed\r\nboats. Meeting with contrary winds he was carried off his course to\r\nDapitan, and from there he set sail again for Zamboanga, which he\r\nreached on July 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Before Ferdinand I left Manila, he had addressed a letter\r\n    to the sultan of Mindanao, at the instance of the Spanish\r\n    Governor-General. The original was written by Ferdinand I in Moro;\r\n    a version in Spanish was dictated by him, and both were signed by\r\n    him. These documents reached the governor of Zamboanga, but he\r\n    had the original in Moro retranslated and found that it did not\r\n    at all agree with the sultan's Spanish rendering. The translation\r\n    of the Moro text runs thus:\r\n\r\n    \"I shall be glad to know that the Sultan Mohammed Amirud Din\r\n    and all his chiefs, male and female, are well. I do not write\r\n    a lengthy letter, as I intended, because I simply wish to give\r\n    you to understand, in case the sultan or his chiefs and others\r\n    should feel aggrieved at my writing this letter in this manner,\r\n    that I do so under pressure, being under foreign dominion, and\r\n    I am compelled to obey whatever they tell me to do, and I have\r\n    to say what they tell me to say. Thus the governor has ordered\r\n    me to write to you in our style and language; therefore, do not\r\n    understand that I am writing you on my own behalf, but because\r\n    I am ordered to do so, and I have nothing more to add. Written\r\n    in the year 1164 in the month Rabi`-ul Akir. Ferdinand I, King\r\n    of Sulu, who seals with his own seal.\"\r\n\r\n    This letter was pronounced treasonable. Impressed with, or feigning\r\n    this idea, Governor Zacharias saw real or imaginary indications\r\n    of a design on the part of the sultan to throw off the foreign\r\n    yoke at the first opportunity. [190]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the landing of Datu Asin and his followers at Zamboanga, the\r\ngovernor found out by his spies that they had many arms and quantities\r\nof ammunition in their boats which lay in the roadstead opposite\r\nthe town and fort. Suspicious and distrustful from the beginning,\r\nZacharias interpreted these facts as positive proof of an intention\r\non the part of the sultan and Datu Asin treacherously to attack the\r\ntown when an opportunity offered itself. He then at once confiscated\r\npart of the arms, ordered the boats to leave the port, imprisoned\r\nthe sultan and Datu Asin and all their retinue, and communicated his\r\nsuspicions and the action taken to Manila. Among the prisoners were\r\nthe sons and daughters of the sultan, several datus and dignitaries\r\nand panditas, and many male and female followers and servants. In\r\nall 217 persons entered the prisons of the fort, most of whom were\r\nlater transferred to Manila and confined in Fort Santiago.\r\n\r\nZacharias's interpretation of the action of the sultan and Datu Asin\r\nwas simply absurd and his behavior reflected considerable discredit\r\non his ability as an officer and administrator. It was further most\r\nregrettable that his views were accepted as true by higher authority\r\nin Manila where no clemency or redress was extended to the unfortunate\r\nsultan and datus.\r\n\r\nBy a degree of the Governor-General, the following accusations were\r\nset forth against the sultan and Datu Asin, viz:\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. That Prince Asin had not surrendered captives; 2. That whilst\r\n    the sultan was in Manila, new captives were made by the party who\r\n    expelled him from the throne; 3. That the number of arms brought\r\n    to Zamboanga by Sulu chiefs was excessive; 4. That the letter to\r\n    Sultan Mohammed Amirud Din insinuated help wanted against the\r\n    Spaniards; 5. That several Mohammedan, but no Christian books,\r\n    were found in the sultan's baggage; 6. That during the journey to\r\n    Zamboanga he had refused to pray in Christian form; 7. That he had\r\n    only attended mass twice; 8. That he had celebrated Mohammedan\r\n    rites, sacrificing a goat, and had given evidence in a hundred\r\n    ways of being a Mohammedan; 9. That his conversation generally\r\n    denoted a want of attachment to the Spaniards, and a contempt for\r\n    their treatment of him in Manila, [191] and, 10. That he still\r\n    cohabited with his concubines.\r\n\r\n    The greatest stress was laid on the recovery of the captive\r\n    Christians, and the governor added, that although the mission\r\n    of the fleet was to restore the sultan to the throne (which,\r\n    by the way, he does not appear to have attempted), the principal\r\n    object was the rescue of Christian slaves. He therefore proposed\r\n    that the liberty of the imprisoned nobles and chiefs should be\r\n    bartered at the rate of 500 Christian slaves for each one of the\r\n    chiefs and nobles, and the balance of the captives for Prince\r\n    Asin and the clergy. [192]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not therefore surprising to hear of the extraordinarily\r\nrevengeful activity which the Sulus exhibited during the period of\r\nhumiliation to which their sultan and nobles were subjected in Manila.\r\n\r\nBantilan was a man of strong personality, a warrior, and a leader. The\r\nexpeditions which he organized against his enemies were unusually\r\nstrong and left havoc everywhere. The towns he pillaged and the\r\ncaptives he carried away alarmed the Spanish Government to a high\r\ndegree. A high council of war was convened in Manila in 1752, which\r\ndeclared for an unmerciful campaign and a war of extermination to\r\nbe conducted with the utmost conceivable cruelty. Volunteers and\r\nBisayan corsairs were called to aid the regular troops. Unlimited\r\nauthority was granted them to annihilate the foe, burn his villages,\r\ndestroy his crops, and desolate his lands. The corsairs were exempted\r\nfrom all taxes. They were allowed to keep or sell all female captives\r\nand all males under 12 and over 30 years of age. Old men and crippled\r\npersons were to be killed. Male captives between 12 and 30 years of\r\nage were to be turned in to the government; the captors to receive\r\nin compensation from P4 to P6 per man. Nursing children were ordered\r\nto be baptized. At first the corsairs were required to turn in to\r\nthe government one-fifth of all valuables looted, but this was soon\r\nafterwards revoked and all corsairs who equipped themselves retained\r\nall their booty.\r\n\r\nAs part of the general campaign, Field Marshal Abad made another attack\r\non Jolo with a force amounting to 1,900 men. The fleet cannonaded\r\nthe forts for seventy-two continuous hours. A division of the troops\r\nlanded and engaged the Sulus, but after suffering considerable loss\r\nretreated disastrously.\r\n\r\nThe raids of the Spaniards and Bisayans helped to increase the\r\nvigilance of the Sulus and excited them to extreme cruelty and an\r\nabnormal degree of revenge. [193]\r\n\r\n\r\n    The year 1753 is stated to have been the bloodiest in the history\r\n    of Moro piracy. No part of the Bisayas escaped ravaging in this\r\n    year, while the Camarines, Batangas, and Albay suffered equally\r\n    with the rest. The conduct of the pirates was more than ordinarily\r\n    cruel. Priests were slain, towns wholly destroyed, and thousands\r\n    of captives carried south into Moro slavery. The condition of the\r\n    Islands at the end of this year was probably the most deplorable\r\n    in their history. [194]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Prince Asin died of grief in his prison.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1753 Alimud Din petitioned the governor to allow Princess\r\nFatimah to go to Jolo for the purpose of arranging a peace with\r\nBantilan. This request was granted on condition that she deliver\r\n50 slaves to the Spanish Government on her arrival at Jolo. This\r\nshe complied with faithfully, adding one Spanish captive to the 50\r\nChristian slaves wanted. Her mission was apparently successful and she\r\nreturned to Manila with Datu Mohammed Ismael and Datu Maharaja-Layla,\r\na commission sent by Bantilan. They brought a letter from Bantilan,\r\nwhich was transmitted to the governor by Alimud Din together with\r\na draft of a treaty for the restoration of peace between Spain and\r\nSulu. Bantilan expressed deep regret for Alimud Din and the existing\r\ncondition of hostility and gave strong assurance of his desire for\r\nthe return of the sultan and the reëstablishment of peace with Spain.\r\n\r\nThe governor acceded to the petition of the sultan and sent a letter\r\nto Bantilan with the commission, requesting that all hostilities stop\r\nfor the period of one year pending the consideration and completion\r\nof the new treaty. In 1754 Governor Arandia assumed command and\r\napproved of the proposed treaty. To expedite matters he sent the\r\ncommanding officer of the southern forces to find out what had been\r\ndone by Bantilan toward the fulfilment of the conditions agreed\r\nupon. Bantilan met the commanding officer in a most friendly manner\r\nand discussed the questions frankly and ably. He explained in clear\r\nand impressive manner the principal causes of hostility and strongly\r\nblamed the governor of Zamboanga for his unjust imprisonment of the\r\nsultan and Datu Asin and his unbearable treatment of the messengers\r\nand representatives of the Sulu authorities. He declared his wish\r\nand true desire for peace and delivered to the commanding officer 68\r\nChristian captives and two Spanish sloops. The officer was strongly\r\nimpressed with the integrity of Bantilan and with the honesty of his\r\nintentions, and gave to the governor a very favorable report of both\r\nAlimud Din and Bantilan. He assured him that the sultan was not a\r\ntraitor at all, but a man of good intentions, who was simply unable\r\nto carry out some of his plans and promises because of the determined\r\nresistance of many of the principal datus.\r\n\r\nA general council was held in Manila early in 1755, in which it was\r\nresolved to set the sultan free and return him to Jolo if the Sulu\r\nauthorities carried out the terms of the following conditions:\r\n\r\n1. That all captives within the sultanate of Sulu be delivered within\r\none year.\r\n\r\n2. That all valuable property and ornaments looted from the churches\r\nbe returned within one year.\r\n\r\nGeneral Zacharias who had attended the council set out from Manila in\r\nSeptember to take charge of the government of Mindanao. He brought back\r\nto Jolo 6 princes, 5 princesses, 20 women, and 130 men of the sultan's\r\nretinue. He had letters from Alimud Din and the Governor-General to\r\nBantilan and was authorized to conduct the preliminaries of a peace\r\ntreaty. Other ambassadors who accompanied Zacharias were empowered\r\nto ratify the same. The ships arrived at Jolo on October 4, and the\r\nambassadors were well received by Bantilan. The latter agreed to all\r\nthe conditions imposed in as far as it was in his power to carry them\r\nout. But he stated that many captives were bought from Mindanao chiefs\r\nand were owned by datus on Basilan and other inaccessible places, who\r\nwere unwilling to give them up unless they were justly compensated. He\r\nadded that many such datus were in alliance with datus in Mindanao\r\nand were planning to attack Zamboanga, and that the time was very\r\ninopportune for him to force them to deliver all captives.\r\n\r\nThe terms were actually impossible of execution and the endeavor to\r\nmake the treaty and ratify it proved fruitless.\r\n\r\nAlimud Din remained in prison until 1763, when the English, after their\r\nconquest and occupation of Manila, reinstated him on the throne of\r\nSulu. During the period of his imprisonment he felt greatly humiliated,\r\nbut lived as a Christian and with one wife only. At the death of his\r\nwife, in 1755, he was allowed to marry a Sulu woman who had been his\r\nconcubine, but who had professed Christianity and was living at the\r\nCollege of Santa Potenciana.\r\n\r\nThe Sulus received their former sultan with a good heart and Alimud\r\nDin resumed his former authority as Sultan of Sulu. The people had\r\nevidently acquired strong sympathy for him and Bantilan had either\r\nundergone a change of heart or felt convinced that it was of no avail\r\nto go against such strong popular sentiment and fight the English\r\nforces. Withdrawing from Jolo he moved to Kuta Gubang near Parang,\r\nwhere, a few years later, he died.\r\n\r\nIn return for the favors which he received from the English, Alimud Din\r\nceded to them that part of North Borneo lying between Cape Inarstang\r\nand the River Frimanis with the adjacent Island of Balambangan and\r\nthe Island of Tulayan. Balambangan was soon after that occupied and\r\ngarrisoned by English forces.\r\n\r\nIn the later days of his reign, Alimud Din was addressed as Amirul\r\nMu'minin (The Prince of the Faithful) by which name he is better known\r\nto the Sulus. Moro incursions increased at that time and the Sulus\r\nbecame so daring as to invade the Bay of Manila in 1769, carry away\r\ncaptives from the wharves of the city, and appear at the Plaza del\r\nPalacio at retreat before they were repulsed or even detected. Becoming\r\nold and weak, Amirul Mu'minin abdicated the sultanate in favor of\r\nhis son Israel, in November, 1773.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREIGN OF SULTAN ISRAEL\r\n\r\nSultan Israel followed the same progressive policy which characterized\r\nhis father's administration. However, his succession was contested\r\nby rivals, and the people were not unanimous in his support. In\r\nhis foreign relations with the English and Spaniards he was at the\r\nbeginning uncertain as to the side toward which to lean. Both powers\r\nhad an eye on Sulu and appeared interested in its affairs. However,\r\nbefore long he refused the request of the English to be allowed to move\r\ntheir factory from Balambangan to Tandu-dayang, in the neighborhood\r\nof Jolo, and exchanged messages of friendship with King Carlos III,\r\nwho congratulated Israel on his succession to the sultanate and thanked\r\nhim for his action relative to the removal of the Balambangan factory\r\nto Sulu Island. [195] The early education Israel received in Manila,\r\ntogether with the consideration with which the Spanish authorities\r\ntreated him at that time, helped to win his sympathies to the Spanish\r\nside and to form a sort of an alliance between Sulu and Spain against\r\nGreat Britain. Such an alliance was further needed to strengthen his\r\nhand in Sulu, for the purpose of checking any insurrection that might\r\nbe fomented by rival datus or unfriendly chiefs. The Spaniards promised\r\nto help him in his endeavors to organize an army and a navy; and, he on\r\nhis part, agreed to open the ports of Sulu for free commerce with the\r\nPhilippine Islands. He further asked the Spanish Government for capital\r\nto work his mines, promising to pay back one-fifth of the output.\r\n\r\nIn 1774 and 1776, Jolo was visited by Captain Thomas Forrest, who in\r\nhis \"Voyage to New Guinea\" described the town and country as he saw\r\nthem. His account is so interesting and so clear that the following\r\nextracts [196] are quoted therefrom:\r\n\r\n\r\n    They have a great variety of fine tropical fruits; the oranges\r\n    are fully as good as those of China. They have also a variety\r\n    of the fruit called jack, or nangka, durians, a kind of large\r\n    custard apple named madang, mangos, mangustines * * *. The Sulus\r\n    having great connection with China, and many Chineses being\r\n    settled amongst them, they have learned the art of ingrafting\r\n    and improving their fruits * * *.\r\n\r\n    The capital town is called Bawang, [197] situated by the seacoast,\r\n    on the northwest part of the island, and containing about 6,000\r\n    inhabitants. Many of them were Ilanun * * *.\r\n\r\n    This island * * * is well cultivated, affording a fine prospect\r\n    from the sea, on every side far superior to that of Malay countries\r\n    in general * * *.\r\n\r\n    Here are wild elephants, the offspring, doubtless, of those sent\r\n    in former days, from the continent of India [198] as presents to\r\n    the kings of Sulu. Those animals avoid meeting with horned cattle,\r\n    though they are not shy of horses. After harvest the Sulus hunt\r\n    the elephants and wild hog, endeavoring to destroy them * * *.\r\n    Sulu has spotted deer, abundance of goats, and black cattle.\r\n\r\n    The pearl fishery * * * proves also to the Sulus the cause of\r\n    their consequence amongst their neighbors, as being a nursery\r\n    for seamen, ready to man a fleet of praus upon an emergency * * *.\r\n    The praus [boats] of the Sulus are very neatly built, from 6 to\r\n    40 tons burden, sail well, and are all fitted with the tripod\r\n    mast. [199] * * *\r\n\r\n    The arts are in greater forwardness here than at Mindanao. * * *\r\n    In the common market is also a copper currency, a convenience much\r\n    wanted at Mindanao, where, as has been said, the market currency\r\n    is rice.\r\n\r\n    The Sulus have in their families many Bisayan, some Spanish\r\n    slaves, whom they purchase from the Ilanun and Magindanao\r\n    cruisers. Sometimes they purchase whole cargoes, which they carry\r\n    to Passir, on Borneo, where, if the females are handsome, they\r\n    are bought up for the Batavia market. The masters sometimes use\r\n    their slaves cruelly, assuming the power of life and death over\r\n    them. Many are put to death for trifling offenses, and their bodies\r\n    left above the ground. An attempt of elopement is here seldom\r\n    pardoned, or indeed at Magindanao. Yet, the distance being so\r\n    small from either Sulu or Slangan, [200] to the Spanish settlement,\r\n    I have wondered how any stay, as they are not closely confined.\r\n\r\n    The Bisayan slaves play often on the violin, and the Sulus are\r\n    fond of European music. [201] I have seen the Sultan Israel, who\r\n    was educated in Manila, and his niece, * * * dance a tolerable\r\n    minuet. I have also seen the datus go down a country dance,\r\n    but as they wore heavy slippers, they did it clumsily.\r\n\r\n    The Sulus are not only neat in their clothes, but dress gaily. The\r\n    men go generally in white waistcoats, buttoned down to the wrist;\r\n    with white breeches, sometimes strait, sometimes wide. * * *\r\n    Both sexes are fond of gaming. * * *\r\n\r\n    In the cool of the evening, I had the pleasure of seeing the\r\n    Sultan's niece and another princess. They wore waistcoats of\r\n    fine muslin close fitted to their bodies; their necks to the\r\n    upper part of the breasts being bare. From the waist downward\r\n    they wore a loose robe, girt with an embroidered zone or belt\r\n    about the middle, with a large clasp of gold, and a precious\r\n    stone. This loose robe like a petticoat came over their drawers,\r\n    and reached to the middle of the leg; the drawers of fine muslin\r\n    reaching to the ankle. They rode across with very short stirrups,\r\n    and wore their hair clubbed atop, Chinese fashion. They often\r\n    put sweet oils on their hair which give it a gloss. The ladies\r\n    sat their horses remarkably well; and this is an exercise women\r\n    of fashion indulge all over the island.\r\n\r\n    \"The Island Sulu is far from being large; but its situation\r\n    between Mindanao and Borneo makes it the mart of all the Moorish\r\n    kingdoms. I do not find that the Portuguese ever pretended to\r\n    settle, much less to conquer these islands; but they visited them\r\n    frequently for the sake of trade; and in those days, there was\r\n    greater commerce in these parts than can well be imagined. For,\r\n    while the trade was open to Japan, there came from thence two or\r\n    three ships laden with silver, amber, silks, chests, cabinets,\r\n    and other curiosities made of sweet-scented woods, with vast\r\n    quantities of silks, quilts, and earthenware, from China. For\r\n    these the merchants of Golconda exchanged their diamonds, those\r\n    of Ceylon their rubies, topazes, and sapphires; from Java and\r\n    Sumatra came pepper, and spices from the Moluccas.\" (Harris'\r\n    History of the Portuguese Empire, p. 685.)\r\n\r\n    About fifteen datus * * * make the greater part of the\r\n    legislature. * * * They sit in council with the Sultan. The\r\n    sultan has two votes in this assembly, and each datu has one. The\r\n    heir apparent, * * * if he side with the sultan, has two votes;\r\n    but, if against him, only one. There are two representatives of\r\n    the people, called mantiris, like the military tribunes of the\r\n    Romans. The common people of Sulu * * * enjoy much real freedom,\r\n    owing to the above representation.\r\n\r\n    The state of Sulu is small, * * * containing scarce above 60,000\r\n    inhabitants; yet are these powerful, and have under them, not only\r\n    most of the islands that compose that Archipelago, but a great part\r\n    of Borneo, some of which they have granted to the English. They\r\n    have the character of being treacherous, and of endeavoring always\r\n    to supply by fraud what they can not effect by force. * * *\r\n\r\n    Only seven years have elapsed since the Sultan of Kulan * *\r\n     * on the northeast of Borneo, was at war with the Sultan of\r\n    Buru, on the same coast. One of them applied to the Sulus for\r\n    assistance. The datus Alimud Din and Nukila went; and watching\r\n    their opportunity, attacked both the sultans, plundered them,\r\n    and carried them with their wives, children, and many of their\r\n    headmen to Sulu. They were sometime after sent back, on condition\r\n    that they should become tributary, which they are at this day.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe intentions of the East India Company in fortifying Balambangan\r\nwere regarded with suspicion by the Spaniards, who employed every\r\nmethod possible to incite hostilities between the Sulus and the\r\nEnglish. The English agents at Jolo won the sympathy of a party\r\nheaded by the strong datus in chief command of the Sulu forces. The\r\nSpaniards had the sultan and his party on their side. This question\r\nof national policy was a matter of serious and important concern to\r\nthe people. It stirred up the whole Sulu community, and party issues\r\nwere ardently and publicly discussed.\r\n\r\nThe jealousy which the English and Spaniards exhibited toward\r\neach other and the methods they used to secure alliance with Sulu,\r\nhad the effect of exciting the suspicion of the Sulus toward both\r\nnations. Besides that, the Spanish officials at Zamboanga showed\r\nexceedingly poor judgment, and their action aroused the indignation\r\nof all parties in Sulu, and led to the renewal of hostilities.\r\n\r\nIn 1773 a majority of the leading datus favored an alliance with\r\nEngland against Spain. In 1775 the English party weakened and the\r\ngarrison of Balambangan was treacherously attacked and destroyed\r\nby Sulu agents and forces secretly sent there by Sultan Israel and\r\nhis council. The conduct of the Sulus in this incident depicts very\r\nclearly a marked trait of the Sulu character. A full description\r\nof this incident is given herewith in the words of Captain Forrest,\r\nwho had an intimate knowledge of the conditions at Balambangan and\r\nthe causes leading to the massacre.\r\n\r\n\r\n    When John Herbert, esq. went to Balambangan early in the preceding\r\n    year [1774], he found great want of buildings to accommodate the\r\n    company's servants, civil and military; those gentlemen who had\r\n    just been saved from the shipwreck of the Royal Captain on the\r\n    shoals of Palawan, as well as the crew of that ship. About this\r\n    time, one Tating, a Sulu datu, and first cousin to Sultan Israel,\r\n    came with many of his vassals to Balambangan, offered his service\r\n    as a builder, was employed by Mr. Herbert, and, in the whole of his\r\n    behavior, gave satisfaction. The datu, falling sick, went home to\r\n    Sulu for the recovery of his health. This blessing soon obtained,\r\n    he returned to the prosecution of his task at Balambangan.\r\n\r\n    He now brought from the sultan and council letters recommending\r\n    him as a trustworthy person, to erect whatever warehouses or\r\n    buildings might be wanted. With him came two other datus, Muluk\r\n    and Nukila. But Datu Tating took care to show only part of his\r\n    numerous followers, concealing the rest in the Island of Banguey,\r\n    and even in some recesses of Balambangan, which, being covered\r\n    with wood, as those islands generally are, there was no great\r\n    fear of discovery.\r\n\r\n    Surmises, however, had some days begun to spread reports of a\r\n    plot, while Tating proceeded with such address, that the chief\r\n    and council, who were not without their suspicions, apprehended\r\n    no danger very nigh.\r\n\r\n    During the night strict watch was kept all over the settlement. At\r\n    dawn, the gun, as usual, announced the morning, and for a few\r\n    moments tranquillity reigned. A house at some small distance\r\n    suddenly fired proved the signal to the Sulus. They rushed into\r\n    the fort, killed the sentries, and turned the guns against the\r\n    Bugis guard. The few settlers, lately rendered fewer by death, were\r\n    fain to make their escape in what vessels they could find. [202]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe governor and five others escaped on board a vessel, leaving behind\r\na great quantity of arms and wealth. The English factors who were\r\nat Jolo fled in a Chinese junk. In the same year Tating attempted a\r\nsimilar attack on Zamboanga, but failed. During 1776 and 1777 he and\r\nother Sulus harassed the Bisayas and ravaged the coast of Cebu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMORO PIRATES\r\n\r\nSultan Israel was poisoned in 1778 by his cousin Alimud Din II,\r\nthe son of Bantilan. During the reign of Sultan Alimud Din II,\r\nhostilities between Sulus and Spaniards increased, and for the period\r\nof ten years or more traffic between Luzon and the southern islands\r\nwas paralyzed. About 500 Spanish and native Christians were every\r\nyear carried into captivity by the Moros. The government was greatly\r\nexercised over this grave situation, and in 1789 the Captain-General\r\nMariquina reported to the King that \"war with the Moros was an evil\r\nwithout remedy.\"\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of 1789 Sharapud Din, the son of Alimud Din I,\r\nascended the throne of Sulu. While a youth he was imprisoned with\r\nhis father in Zamboanga and accompanied the latter to Manila. Very\r\nlittle is known of his reign except that he was animated by the same\r\nspirit and principles which characterized his father's reign and that\r\nof his brother Israel. He coined money, and one of his coins which\r\nwas obtained from Jolo bears the date 1204 A. H., which was probably\r\nthe date of his succession. Sultan Sharapud Din was followed by his\r\nsons Alimud Din III and Aliyud Din I.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The continued presence of the Moros in Mindoro, where they haunted\r\n    the bays and rivers of both east and west coasts for months at a\r\n    time, stealing out from this island for attack in every direction,\r\n    was specially noted by Padre Zuñiga, and indicated how feebly\r\n    the Spaniards repulsed these pirates a hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n    It was the last severe phase of Malay piracy, when even the\r\n    strong merchant ships of England and America dreaded the Straits\r\n    of Borneo and passed with caution through the China Sea. Northern\r\n    Borneo, the Sulu Archipelago, and the southern coasts of Mindanao\r\n    were the centers from which came these fierce sea wolves, whose\r\n    cruel exploits have left their many traditions in the American\r\n    and British merchant navies, just as they periodically appear in\r\n    the chronicles of the Philippines.\r\n\r\n    Five hundred captives annually seem to have been the spoils taken\r\n    by these Moros in the Philippine Islands, and as far south as\r\n    Batavia and Macassar captive Filipinos were sold in the slave\r\n    marts of the Malays. The aged and infirm were inhumanly bartered\r\n    to the savage tribes of Borneo, who offered them up in their\r\n    ceremonial sacrifices. The measures of the Spanish Government,\r\n    though constant and expensive, were ineffective. Between 1778 and\r\n    1793 a million and a half of pesos were expended on the fleets\r\n    and expeditions to drive back or punish the Moros, but at the\r\n    end of the century a veritable climax of piracy was attained.\r\n\r\n    Pirates swarmed continually about the coasts of Mindoro,\r\n    Burias, and Masbate, and even frequented the esteros [203] of\r\n    Manila Bay. Some sort of peace seems to have been established\r\n    with Jolo and a friendly commerce was engaged in toward the\r\n    end of the century, but the Moros of Mindanao and Borneo were\r\n    increasing enemies. In 1798 a fleet of 25 Moro bancas passed up\r\n    the Pacific coast of Luzon and fell upon the isolated towns of\r\n    Baler, Kasiguran, and Palanan, destroying the pueblos and taking\r\n    450 captives. The cura of Kasiguran was ransomed in Binangonan\r\n    for the sum of 2,500 pesos. For four years this pirate fleet had\r\n    its rendezvous on Burias, whence it raided the adjacent coasts\r\n    and Katanduan Island. [204]\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernor Aguilar assumed command in 1793 and made every effort to\r\nremedy this condition of affairs. He divided the Archipelago into six\r\ndivisions, each of which was provided with a fleet of six gunboats. He\r\nrepaired the forts of the Bisayas, Mindoro, Tayabas, Batangas, and\r\nZamboanga. While preparing for defence, he negotiated with the Sulu\r\nand Mindanao Moros for peace and partially succeeded in establishing\r\na condition of truce with Sulu.\r\n\r\nIn 1798 he convened a council to consider further measures for the\r\nsuppression of piracy. All records pertaining to Moro affairs were\r\nsubmitted to Rufino Suarez, \"Asesor del Gobierno,\" who was directed\r\nto report on this subject. The report was rendered in April, 1800,\r\nand contained full information and recommendations as to the best\r\nmeasures and methods that the government could undertake for that\r\npurpose. Aguilar, however, did not act on the recommendations of\r\nSuarez, but continued his negotiations with the Moros who became\r\npeaceful and remained so until 1803. In this year the English attacked\r\nZamboanga unsuccessfully, instigated hostility between Sulu and Spain,\r\nand reoccupied the Island of Balambangan, which they held for three\r\nyears only.\r\n\r\nIn 1805 a treaty was made between Sulu and Spain whereby it was agreed\r\nthat no foreign resident would be permitted in Sulu without the\r\nconsent of the Spanish Government, and that in case of war between\r\nSpain and any foreign country, the Sultan's ports would be closed\r\nagainst Spain's enemies. Between 1805 and 1815 detailed accounts of\r\npiratical raids are infrequent.\r\n\r\nSultan Aliyud Din died in 1808 and was succeeded by his pious brother\r\nShakirul Lah. It is related that Shakirul Lah slept on boards and\r\ncovered himself with sarongs only. He used to leave his home at night,\r\nsearch for the poor and needy and feed them.\r\n\r\nIn 1815, the raiders took 1,000 native prisoners and captured several\r\nSpanish, British, and Dutch vessels. In October, 1818, a Spanish fleet\r\nunder Pedro Esteban encountered 25 Moro vessels in the vicinity of\r\nAlbay, seized nine of them and sank the rest.\r\n\r\nSultan Shakirul Lah was succeeded in 1823 by Sultan Jamalul Kiram\r\nI, the son of Alimud Din III. In the same year, Governor Antonio\r\nMartinez, impressed by the superior policy and success of Corcuera,\r\norganized an expedition under Alonso Morgado and attacked the pirates\r\nin their home lairs, at Basilan, Pilas, Sulu, and Mindanao. The Spanish\r\nfleet consisted of 2 schooners, 4 gunboats, 6 tenders, 2 junks, and\r\n1 transport schooner. The expedition reached Pilas in March, 1825,\r\ntook the fort by assault and killed 50 Moros. At Jolo it cannonaded\r\nthe town for ten hours and then left for Mindanao, where it inflicted\r\nconsiderable damage. It destroyed Moro boats at Illana Bay, Pollok,\r\nand Dumankilis Bay.\r\n\r\nGeneral Ricafort sent another expedition, in 1827, to Jolo, consisting\r\nof 20 vessels and 500 troops; but Jolo was so well fortified and the\r\nMoro forces so numerous that the Spanish soldiers could not disembark,\r\nand the expedition returned without accomplishing any results.\r\n\r\nThe seal of Sultan Jamalul Kiram I bears the date 1239 A. H., or\r\nabout 1823 A. D., which in all probability indicates the year of his\r\nsuccession. He issued regular appointment forms for his subordinate\r\nofficers of state and dated his communications, using the current\r\nMalay and Mohammedan dates combined. In the estimation of the Sulus\r\nhe was a strong and very prosperous sultan.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of September, 1836 A. D. or 1252 A. H., he signed a\r\ncommercial treaty with Capt. José M. Halcon as the representative of\r\nCaptain-General Salazar. [205] The principal part of the treaty was\r\nan agreement regulating boat licenses and the duties to be paid by\r\nSulu boats in Manila and Zamboanga and by Spanish vessels in Jolo. In\r\nanother document bearing the same date and signed by the same parties,\r\nan alliance was declared guaranteeing general peace and safety to\r\nSulu boats in Philippine waters and to Spanish and Filipino craft in\r\nthe Sulu Sea. The sultan further consented to have a Spanish trading\r\nhouse constructed at Jolo for the safe storage of merchandise under\r\nthe charge of a Spanish resident agent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATY OF 1836 WITH THE SULTAN OF SULU\r\n\r\n\r\nTEXT OF THE TREATY\r\n\r\nArticles of agreement arranging the duties to be paid by Sulu craft\r\nin Manila and Zamboanga, and by Spanish craft in Jolo, which schedule\r\ncan not be changed except by a new agreement.\r\n\r\nArticle 1. Sulu craft which, with proper license, go to Manila, may\r\nimport products of the Islands subject to the Sultan, by paying a\r\nconsumption duty of 2 1/2%.\r\n\r\nArticle 2. Wax and cacao may be deposited in the Manila Custom-House\r\nby paying 1%; but if these articles are imported the established 14%\r\nwill be paid.\r\n\r\nArticle 3. Sulu craft that trade in Zamboanga will pay a duty of 1%\r\non products of the islands subject to the Sultan.\r\n\r\nArticle 4. All these duties will be paid in silver to the Protecting\r\nSpanish Government on the basis of one-half the appraised value.\r\n\r\nArticle 5. Spanish craft in Jolo will pay the following duties in kind:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                Pesos\r\nShips of three masts from Manila, with Chinese passengers       2,000\r\nThe same, without passengers                                    1,800\r\nBrigantine from Manila, with Chinese passengers                 1,500\r\nThe same, without passengers                                    1,300\r\nSchooner from Manila, with Chinese passengers                   1,400\r\nThe same, without passengers                                    1,200\r\nPontin (small trading boat) from Manila, with Chinese\r\n    passengers                                                  1,400\r\nThe same, without passengers                                    1,200\r\nGalley from Manila or other ports of the Philippines, with\r\n    cargo of rice (palay), sugar and saguranes [206]              300\r\nThe same for the Philippine Islands with cargo of merchandise     500\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 6. These duties fixed for Spanish craft will be paid in kind\r\nin accordance with the values laid down in the following schedule,\r\none-half of which will be selected by the Sultan's government officials\r\nfrom the cargo and the other half shall consist of such articles as\r\nthe captain of the boat may select, valuation to be  in accordance\r\nwith the schedule.

Halcon, (His flourish).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION OF THE TREATY OF 1836 BY THE QUEEN REGENT OF SPAIN\r\n\r\nIsabel II, Queen of Spain, by the Grace of God and the Constitution of\r\nthe Spanish Monarchy, and in her Royal name and during her minority,\r\nthe Queen Dowager her mother, Doña María Cristina of Bourbon, Regent\r\nof the Kingdom:\r\n\r\nWhereas on the twenty-third of September of last year, at the palace\r\nof Jolo, a treaty of peace, protection and commerce having been drawn\r\nup, concluded and signed by the frigate-captain of the national fleet,\r\nDon José María Halcon, commander in chief of the naval forces anchored\r\nin the roadstead of Jolo, representing the Captain General of the\r\nPhilippine Islands, and the Sultan Jamalul Kiram and Datus; which\r\nsaid treaty, composed of six articles, word by word, is as follows:\r\n\r\nCapitulations of Peace, Protection and Commerce, executed to the\r\nmost Excellent Sultan and Datus of Sulu, by his high Excellency the\r\nCaptain-General, Governor of the Philippine Islands, in the name of\r\nthe high and powerful Sovereignty of her Catholic Majesty, being drawn\r\nup and agreed to by both parties, to wit: representing the Spanish\r\nGovernment as plenipotentiary of his high Excellency the Captain\r\nGeneral, Don Pedro Antonio Salazar, Governor of the Philippines, the\r\nfrigate-captain of the royal fleet, Don José María Halcon, commander\r\nin chief of the naval forces anchored in the roadstead of Jolo; and\r\nupon the other part, the Sultan Jamalul Kiram, Raja of Sulu and Datus\r\nwho subscribe, which parties enacted as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Article 1\r\n\r\n    His high Excellency the Captain-General, Governor, for her Catholic\r\n    Majesty, of the Philippine Islands, assures the most excellent\r\n    Sultan and Datus of Sulu, for the present and forever, of the most\r\n    stable peace between the Spaniards and natives of all the islands\r\n    subject to the Crown of Spain and the tributaries of the lands\r\n    governed by the Sultan and Datus. He offers the protection of his\r\n    Government and the aid of fleets and soldiers for the wars which\r\n    the Sultan shall find necessary to wage against enemies who shall\r\n    attack him, or in order to accomplish the subjection of the peoples\r\n    who rebel in all the confines of the islands which are found\r\n    within Spanish jurisdiction, and which extend from the western\r\n    point of Mindanao as far as Borneo and Palawan, except Sandakan\r\n    and the other lands tributary to the Sultan on the coast of Borneo.\r\n\r\n    The Sultan of Sulu, upon his part, accepting the friendship of\r\n    the Spanish Government, binds himself to keep peace with all the\r\n    vassals of her Catholic Majesty, and further binds himself to\r\n    consider as his enemies those who hereafter may be such to the\r\n    Spanish nation, the Sulus proceeding with armed men to the wars\r\n    which may arise, in the same manner as if they were Spaniards; in\r\n    case of his furnishing such aid, the provisions for the support\r\n    of the Sulus shall be supplied by the Royal exchequer of her\r\n    Catholic Majesty, as they are for the other soldiers and people\r\n    of her army and navy.\r\n\r\n    The sense of the second clause of the Capitulations of one thousand\r\n    seven hundred and thirty-seven, that they are not bound to furnish\r\n    assistance for wars against European nations, is hereby renewed\r\n    and affirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Article 2\r\n\r\n    In accordance with the friendship and protection which unite\r\n    Sulu with the Spanish provinces of the Philippines, the Sulu\r\n    boats shall navigate and trade freely with the open ports of\r\n    Manila and Zamboanga, and the Spanish vessels with Jolo, where\r\n    not only will both be well received, but shall find protection\r\n    and the same treatment as the natives.\r\n\r\n    In a separate Capitulation are determined the duties which the\r\n    Spanish vessels shall pay in Jolo, and those which the Sulus\r\n    shall pay in Manila and Zamboanga; but by these Capitulations it\r\n    is agreed that whenever the Sulus convey cargoes of products of\r\n    the islands, they shall pay in Manila and Zamboanga less than\r\n    foreign vessels, and the Spanish vessels shall not pay in Jolo\r\n    as much as is charged the ships of other nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Article 3\r\n\r\n    In order that the traffic of Spanish vessels in Jolo shall not\r\n    suffer the injuries and delays occasioned by the difficulties of\r\n    their market, the Sultan and Datus consent to the construction of a\r\n    factory or trading house, with safe warehouses, where merchandise\r\n    may be stored without risk: and the Sultan and Datus agree always\r\n    to respect this place, in which there will be a resident Spanish\r\n    agent, who shall assume charge of all the business entrusted\r\n    to him. If the Sulus should desire to do likewise in Manila,\r\n    they shall be permitted; but the Spanish Government receives\r\n    for storage merchandise from the Custom-house of that city upon\r\n    payment of fees of but one per centum.\r\n\r\n    The Sultan shall designate the proper place for the location\r\n    of the warehouses, which shall be convenient for loading and\r\n    unloading and the Government shall request the Sultan to furnish,\r\n    and shall pay for, the materials and workmen that may be necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Article 4\r\n\r\n    In order that the Spanish and Sulu vessels may navigate and trade\r\n    with safety, free from the piracies of the Hanuns and Samals\r\n    the Spanish Government will strengthen its fleets in Mindanao\r\n    waters, which same will protect equally those of both nations;\r\n    and in order that good may not be confused with evil persons,\r\n    the following rules shall be observed:\r\n\r\n    1st. All Spanish vessels arriving at Jolo shall show to the Sultan\r\n    their permit upon anchoring, and the same shall be sealed upon\r\n    sailing; without which the captain shall be punished at Manila.\r\n\r\n    2d. All Sulu vessels which proceed to Manila or Zamboanga, shall\r\n    carry the permit of the Sultan, and in possession of the same\r\n    shall be free and unmolested.\r\n\r\n    3d. All Spanish or Sulu vessels which shall proceed for trading\r\n    to Mindanao, shall go first to Zamboanga to notify the Governor,\r\n    who shall sign their permit without cost.\r\n\r\n    4th. Every Spanish or Sulu vessel which shall be found by the\r\n    fleets of Illana or Sindangan bays, without permit of the Governor\r\n    and Sultan as aforesaid, shall be seized and shall lose all her\r\n    merchandise, of which two-thirds shall be awarded to those making\r\n    the capture and one-third to the Sultan of Sulu, if the vessel\r\n    is Sulu, and to the Spanish Government if the vessel is Spanish.\r\n\r\n    5th. The Governor of Zamboanga shall determine the procedure in\r\n    the case of vintas [small sail boats] of the towns of Pilas and\r\n    Basilan Islands friendly to said Plaza [Zamboanga].\r\n\r\n    6th. Sulu merchant vessels proceeding outside the islands of the\r\n    Sultan or to Mindanao with a permit, should not flee from the\r\n    fleets which they encounter, because the latter are intended to\r\n    defend them and run down evil-doers. Commanders of the fleets\r\n    shall be ordered to receive and aid the advice-boats of the Sultan.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Article 5\r\n\r\n    The Sultan and Datus of Sulu pledge themselves to prevent the\r\n    piracies of the Ilanuns and Samals in the Philippines, and if they\r\n    are unable, the Sultan shall so report in order that the Spanish\r\n    Government may afford assistance or undertake the task alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Last Article\r\n\r\n    If the sense of these Capitulations is not conformable in both\r\n    languages, the same shall agree with the literal Spanish text.\r\n\r\n    Palace of Jolo, September 23, 1836, which is the fourteenth of the\r\n    moon Jamadul Akir of one thousand two hundred and fifty-two.

The Balangingi and Basilan Moros appear about this time to\r\nhave become a menace to the peace and to the commerce of nations. To\r\npunish Datu Usak of Malusu for depredations committed against French\r\nvessels, Basilan was blockaded by a French fleet in 1843. Aspiring\r\nfor Chinese trade and for the possession of a port in the neighboring\r\nseas the French in 1844 concluded a treaty with the Sultan of Sulu\r\nfor the cession of the Island of Basilan for a considerable sum of\r\nmoney. The terms of this treaty do not appear to have been carried\r\nout, but this act and the frequent appearance of English, Dutch,\r\nand French vessels in Sulu waters aroused the Spaniards to active\r\nmeasures for the subjugation of the Sulu Archipelago.\r\n\r\nThis year Jamalul Kiram I died, and his son Mohammed Pulalun succeeded\r\nto the sultanate. The \"Luntar\" or \"Sulu Annals\" begin January, 1844,\r\nand appear to have been started by Sultan Pulalun.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 a frigate attacked the Island of Balangingi, but it was\r\nrepulsed and gained no advantage except that of ascertaining the\r\nstrength of the enemy. The shores of Basilan and the principal\r\nislands lying between it and the Island of Sulu had numerous forts,\r\nthe strongest of which were on the island of Balangingi, the chief\r\nstronghold and headquarters of the Samal pirates. Realizing the\r\nseriousness of the situation Governor Claveria took the matter in\r\nhand and with energy and enthusiasm made every effort to strengthen\r\nthe fleet and increase its efficiency.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 he secured three steam war vessels called Elcano, Magallanes,\r\nand Reina de Castilla which were built by the English and were the\r\nfirst steam gunboats the Philippine Government ever employed. Steam\r\nwas certainly destined to mark a new epoch, one which saw the beginning\r\nof the end of Moro piracy.\r\n\r\nWith two additional pilot boats and three transport brigs the\r\nexpedition, headed by Governor Claveria in person, left Manila in\r\nJanuary and, coming by the way of Dapitan, reunited at Caldera Bay,\r\nwhere it received additional troops from Zamboanga.\r\n\r\nThe Island of Balangingi is scarcely 6 square miles in area,\r\nlow, flat, surrounded by shoals, and covered to a great extent by\r\nmangrove swamps. Most of its settlements had their houses built over\r\nthe water and little dry land could be seen in the vicinity. Part\r\nof this land was covered with coconut trees. A labyrinth of small,\r\nnarrow channels led to the various settlements and divided the island\r\ninto four distinct parts. Four strong forts were built by the Moros\r\nat points difficult of access and surrounded by swamps. These forts\r\nwere constructed of thick trunks of trees driven into the soil as\r\npiles and set close to each other and in 3 rows of varying heights,\r\nto afford suitable positions for the artillery, part of which was set\r\nin covered inclosures commanding the channel leading to the fort. The\r\nwalls of these forts were 20 feet high and could not be scaled without\r\nladders. The immediate vicinity of the fort was set with sharpened\r\nbamboo sticks and pits to hinder and trap the attacking forces. The\r\nfort of Sipak, the strongest of the four, was provided with redoubts\r\nand towers and showed considerable skill in its construction.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish troops consisted of three regular companies of infantry,\r\ntwo of volunteers, and detachments of artillery, pikemen, engineers,\r\nand laborers. They experienced some difficulty in landing and attacked\r\nthe most accessible fort first. The fighting was heroic and desperate\r\non both sides. The Moros, it is said, fought like fiends; but they were\r\ncompletely overpowered in the end. In the fort of Sipak many women\r\nand children were gathered and considerable property was stored. The\r\nMoros had hoped to save all within its impregnable walls. When these\r\nwalls were entered, some of the defenders in their desperation thrust\r\ntheir spears and krises into their wives and children, killed them\r\nfirst, and then dashed themselves against sure death at the point of\r\nSpanish bayonets. The Moros consider such action most valorous and\r\nhonorable and do it in order not to allow their wives and children\r\nto fall into slavery or be killed by the hand of the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn the fight at the first fort 100 Moros perished and 14 pieces\r\nof artillery were captured. The Spaniards lost 7 dead and 50\r\nwounded. After the reduction of the second fort at Sipak 340 Moros were\r\nburned in one pile and 150, mostly women and children, were taken as\r\nprisoners; others, who sought refuge in the swamps or tried to swim\r\naway, were killed by the fire of the fleet and their bodies were\r\nwashed ashore by the waves. The Spanish losses in this engagement\r\namounted to 17 dead, 4 officers and 13 men, and 155 wounded. Three\r\nhundred slave captives were rescued and 66 pieces of artillery were\r\ncaptured. Quantities of ammunition, silks, silver and gold vessels,\r\nbracelets and other ornaments, jewels, utensils and arms of all sorts,\r\nand books of prayer were found inside the fort.\r\n\r\nThe troops investing the third fortification at Sungap found the\r\nfort evacuated, but the first Spaniard who scaled the wall fell dead\r\nfrom a kampilan blow at the hand of the only Moro who refused to run\r\naway and remained at his post to meet what he considered an honorable\r\ndeath. Thirteen cannons of small caliber were found in this fort. The\r\nMoros who had fled to the fourth fort at Bukutingal did not make any\r\ndetermined stand, but soon fled leaving several cannons behind. The\r\nSpaniards desolated the island, burned its forts and settlements,\r\nand cut down more than 8,000 coconut trees.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of the Balangingi Samals was complete and the expedition\r\nreturned to Manila in triumph. Here great rejoicings, parades, and\r\nfestivities were held in honor of the event. Governor Claveria was\r\ndecorated and promoted by the Queen and many of the officers and men\r\nwere variously rewarded.\r\n\r\nThe Balangingi Samals rivaled the Sulus in power, bravery, and wealth,\r\nbut the signal victory of Claveria crushed them so completely that\r\nthey have never since had any considerable force. The Samals who were\r\ncarried away were transplanted to the Province of Kagayan in northern\r\nLuzon, where they remained until a late date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVISITS TO JOLO OF CAPTAIN HENRY KEPPEL AND SIR JAMES BROOKE\r\n\r\nIn December, 1848, Jolo was visited by Capt. Henry Keppel, in command\r\nof the Maeander, and his description of the town contained in the\r\nfollowing extracts taken from his \"Visit to the Indian Archipelago\"\r\nwill be of unusual interest: [207]\r\n\r\n\r\n    The town is built partly on land and partly on the sea. That\r\n    part which is on the land, and which might almost be called the\r\n    citadel, was at the time of our visit, strongly stockaded and\r\n    flanked with batteries mounting heavy guns * * *. That portion\r\n    of the town which is not within the stockades is built in regular\r\n    Malay fashion, on piles. The houses run in rows, or streets; and\r\n    outside of them is a platform about 6 feet wide to walk upon. This\r\n    is supported underneath by a light scaffolding of bamboo. These\r\n    rows of birdcage-looking buildings extend into the sea for half a\r\n    mile over a shoal which is nearly dry at low water. The population\r\n    is numerous, composed principally of fishermen and Chinese\r\n    traders. The said platform runs the whole length of the rows:\r\n    and its planks were so carelessly thrown across that it seemed\r\n    wonderful how the children could escape, if they always did escape,\r\n    falling through the yawning spaces which invited them to a watery,\r\n    or a muddy grave; they were crawling about these rickety stages\r\n    in vast numbers; if the tide was out when they fell, they would\r\n    be received into 3 feet deep of soft mud, supposing always that\r\n    they did not break their little backs across the gunwales of the\r\n    canoes beneath, which were made fast to the scaffolding. * * *\r\n\r\n    What we saw of the country [in the neighborhood of Jolo]\r\n    was highly cultivated, consisting, with intervals of jungle,\r\n    of pasture grounds and gardens, very flourishing and pretty,\r\n    with abundance of cattle. * * *\r\n\r\n    The day after we had commenced [watering] was a market day. The\r\n    mountaineers came down in parties of from six to twelve, mounted\r\n    on well-formed little horses, or oxen, according to their\r\n    rank and means; on these they sat with graceful ease, spear in\r\n    hand--they were all well armed besides, with shield and kris;\r\n    in some instances also we observed the heavy two-handed Ilanun\r\n    sword [kampilan]. They had a wild and independent bearing;\r\n    and, when seen in groups, some standing, some squatting, the\r\n    women all chattering, under the wide spreading tree, they much\r\n    increased the interest of the already picturesque scene. They\r\n    seemed indifferent as to the sale of their stock, which was\r\n    conducted chiefly by the women, who freely accompanied them,\r\n    and were by no means ill favored. The townspeople, who met and\r\n    traded with these mountaineers, were dressed in gayer colors,\r\n    but not so well armed. * * * Though the market on this occasion\r\n    was well attended, the trade was slack; but I doubt not that,\r\n    in the palmy days of active piracy, a considerable amount of\r\n    business was transacted under this old banyan tree. * * *\r\n\r\n    December 30 was the day appointed for Sir James Brooke's\r\n    interview with the Sultan of Sulu. We landed in full costume at\r\n    10 o'clock. Having walked over the sea suburbs, and arrived at\r\n    the beach, we found a guard of honor and attendants waiting to\r\n    conduct Sir James to the Sultan's presence; they were a motley\r\n    group, but made themselves useful in clearing the way.\r\n\r\n    Passing within the outer stockade, we arrived, after a few minute's\r\n    walk, at the royal residence. It was walled in and fortified:\r\n    a large space was inclosed by double rows of heavy piles driven\r\n    into the earth, about 5 feet apart, and the space was filled up\r\n    with large stones and earth, making a very solid wall of about\r\n    15 feet in height, having embrasures, or rather portholes, in\r\n    convenient places for cannon, out of which we noticed the rusty\r\n    muzzles of some very heavy guns protruding. A great part of the\r\n    town was stockaded in a similar way; and the country houses of\r\n    the datus and mountain chiefs of any importance were also walled\r\n    in and had guns mounted.\r\n\r\n    Passing through a massive gateway, pretty well flanked with guns\r\n    and loopholes, we entered a large court, in which some 2,000\r\n    persons were assembled, armed and in their best apparel, but\r\n    observing no sort of order; it was a wild and novel sight. Malays\r\n    are always armed. The kris to them is what the sword was to\r\n    an English gentleman in the feudal times. Every person who, by\r\n    virtue of his rank or on any other pretext, could gain admittance\r\n    was in attendance on this occasion; for our Rajah had become a\r\n    justly celebrated man in the great Eastern Archipelago, and was\r\n    an object of curiosity.\r\n\r\n    We were conducted through the crowd to a corner of the courtyard,\r\n    where a building inferior to a small English barn, was pointed\r\n    out as the Sultan's palace. We entered it by a flight of broad\r\n    wooden steps (for the palace was raised on piles), through a\r\n    narrow passage thronged with guards * * * and we found ourselves\r\n    in the royal presence.\r\n\r\n    The audience chamber was not very large; a table, covered with\r\n    green cloth, ran across the center of it; above the table, and\r\n    around the upper end of the room sat a very brilliant semicircle of\r\n    personages, the Sultan occupying a raised seat in the middle. The\r\n    cortège consisted of his grand vizier, the members of the royal\r\n    family, and the great datus and officers of state. Behind these\r\n    stood the guards and attendants, dressed in silks, the colors\r\n    being according to the fancy of their respective masters.\r\n\r\n    The Sultan gave us a gracious reception, shaking hands with each\r\n    officer as he was presented. This ceremony over, chairs were\r\n    placed for Sir James and his suite; while those of our party,\r\n    who could not get seats, formed a semicircle on the other side\r\n    of the table. The scene was striking and gay.\r\n\r\n    The Sultan is a young-looking man, but with a dull and vacant\r\n    expression, produced by the too free use of opium: his lips\r\n    were red with the mixture of betel nut and cere leaf, [208]\r\n    which he chewed.\r\n\r\n    He was dressed in rich silks, red and green the predominant\r\n    colors. A large jewel sparkled in his turban, and he wore jewels\r\n    also profusely on his person.\r\n\r\n    The hilt of his kris, the great distinguishing ornament of all\r\n    Malays, was beautifully decorated with gold wire, curiously\r\n    twisted in. Immediately behind the Sultan, in closest attendance\r\n    on his person, stood the cupbearer, a fine young man dressed in\r\n    green silk, who held in his hand a purple finger glass, which\r\n    was constantly held to his royal master's mouth, to receive\r\n    the filthy-looking mixture which is in such favor with these\r\n    people--composed of the juice of the betel leaf, with the areca\r\n    nut and gambier. The other personages composing the circle were\r\n    dressed with equal gaudiness, in bright silks; in the selection,\r\n    however, of their colors they displayed considerable taste. Many\r\n    of the guards were dressed in very ancient chain armor, consisting\r\n    of skull caps and tunics, covering the arms and reaching from\r\n    the throat to the knee.\r\n\r\n    Those armed with sword, spear, and kris did not look amiss; but\r\n    two sentries, placed to guard the entrance to this ancient hall of\r\n    audience, each shouldering a very shabby-looking old Tower musket,\r\n    of which they looked very proud, had an absurd effect.\r\n\r\n    After a reasonable time passed by each party in admiration of\r\n    the other, the conversation was opened by Sir James Brooke, who,\r\n    as Her Majesty's commissioner in these regions, submitted to the\r\n    Sultan certain propositions on matters of business.\r\n\r\n    To these His Majesty expressed his willingness to accede; and\r\n    he graciously reminded Sir James that the royal family of Sulu\r\n    were under considerable obligations to the English; inasmuch as\r\n    his great-grandfather, Sultan Amir, [209] having been once upon\r\n    a time imprisoned by the Spaniards in the fortress of Manila,\r\n    was delivered from durance vile and reinstated on the throne of\r\n    his ancestors by Alexander Dalrymple----A. D. 1763. This was now\r\n    the more liberal on the part of His Majesty, because his royal\r\n    ancestor had not at the time allowed the service to be altogether\r\n    unrequited; for he ceded to the English Government a fine island\r\n    adjoining Sulu (of which, by the bye, no use appears to have been\r\n    made), together with the north end of Borneo and the south end\r\n    of Palawan, with the intervening islands.\r\n\r\n    At length we took leave of his Majesty, retiring in much the\r\n    same order as that in which we had entered. Although no actual\r\n    treaty was concluded with the Sultan, Sir James paved the way for\r\n    opening up commerce and for cultivating a better understanding\r\n    with the natives.\r\n\r\n    In the afternoon we visited one Datu Daniel, a powerful chief,\r\n    very friendly, and well disposed toward the English. His stronghold\r\n    was at a short distance in the country, at the foot of one of the\r\n    mountain slopes, fortified in much the same way as the Sultan's,\r\n    but on a smaller scale; his stockades were, however, quite as\r\n    strong, and his guns in better order. His inclosed court, being\r\n    likewise a farmyard with a good supply of live stock, looked as\r\n    if he was better prepared than his royal master to stand a long\r\n    siege; his wives looked happy, his children merry, and, on the\r\n    whole, his domestic life appeared tolerably comfortable. * * *\r\n\r\n    Considering that Sulu was the great commercial center of these\r\n    seas, we were surprised at not seeing more large praus; there\r\n    were none afloat, and very few hauled up; the number, however,\r\n    of building sheds and blacksmith's forges showed that they have\r\n    the means of starting into activity at short notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho could have thought that, after such devastation and havoc as the\r\nSpaniards wrought on Balangingi, another chief would have the courage\r\nto settle on such a hateful spot again! Yet we learn that in spite\r\nof the contrary advice of the Sultan and his council, Datu Tampang,\r\nas early as December, 1848, stationed himself at Pa'at, Balangingi\r\nIsland, and constructed a fort with the intention of defying the\r\nSpanish forces and fighting them again. An isolated case like this can\r\nnot be explained except on the ground of foolhardiness, for Tampang\r\nwas soon after that dislodged by the governor of Zamboanga. But it\r\nappears that it was necessary again for the Spaniards to send another\r\nsquadron under Manuel Quesada, consisting of two steam gunboats and\r\nother sloops and vessels, to clean up Balangingi once more and to\r\nstrike at the Moros of Basilan and Pilas. Nor was this sufficient, for\r\nwe learn that before the end of the same month of December, 3,000 Sulus\r\nand Samals attacked the Spanish forces on Basilan, probably at Isabela,\r\nand were repulsed. In 1849 the Spaniards retaliated and reduced to\r\nashes the settlements of Bwal, Samalang, and Gumbalang. Undaunted,\r\nthe Moros of Tonkil, together with others, in 1850 raided the Islands\r\nof Samar and Kamigin and carried away more than 75 natives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nDECLINE OF SULU, 1851-1896\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPEDITION AGAINST JOLO\r\n\r\nThe fearlessness of the Moros in battle, their determination,\r\npersistence, and fortitude must have disheartened the Spaniards\r\nvery often in their weary attempts to conquer and pacify Sulu. The\r\nSulus have never had any standing army. Every able-bodied male was\r\na soldier and a sailor. Thousands of Sulus and Samals stood ready\r\nat a moment's notice to man a fleet and defend a fort. Every fort\r\nthe Spaniards reduced the Sulus could rebuild in a short time;\r\nevery fleet destroyed they could replace with little expense. They\r\nhad enough pearls to purchase guns and ammunition, and a few months\r\nafter a defeat they were ready to fight again, better prepared than\r\nbefore. War with Sulu, in the way it was conducted, meant a war of\r\nextermination and hostilities without end. Its worst evils befell the\r\nhelpless natives of the coast settlements of the Bisayas and southern\r\nLuzon to whom Spain was unable to afford safe protection. The Moros\r\nwould slip through in the night or take advantage of a favorable wind\r\nand attack the Spanish forces or the defenseless villages while they\r\nwere unaware of danger or unprepared for a fight. For a long while it\r\nseemed beyond the power of the Philippine Government to reëstablish\r\npeace or restrict hostilities to Sulu waters. The magnificent victory\r\nof Claveria was hailed as marking the beginning of a new era of safety\r\nand glory, but its effects did not last long, and the fear of the\r\nMoros beset the hearts of the Bisayans once more.\r\n\r\nIn the light of such profound experience as the Philippine Government\r\nhad had with Moro affairs Governor Urbiztondo might have contented\r\nhimself with punishing the Moros of Tonkil and their abettors and\r\nallies, but another element of serious concern entered into the\r\nproblem which threatened not only to render it more vexatious and\r\nunsolvable, but dangerous in the extreme. It was not so much the evils\r\nof disturbed relations with Sulu as the harm that would arise from\r\nEnglish occupation of or alliance with Sulu that Urbiztondo feared,\r\nfor in 1849, Sir James Brooke visited Jolo and made a treaty with the\r\nSultan of Sulu, [210] the seventh article of which declared a promise\r\nmade by the Sultan of Sulu not to make any cessions of territory within\r\nhis dominion nor recognize sovereignty rights nor promise fealty to any\r\nnation without the consent of Great Britain. The overt object of this\r\ntreaty was \"to keep open for the benefit of the mercantile world that\r\nimprovable field for commercial enterprise,\" but the ultimate purpose\r\nof such an agreement was not difficult to foresee. The governor of\r\nZamboanga went to Jolo and protested strongly, declaring such a treaty\r\nan act of disloyalty to Spain, for which the Sultan and his council\r\nwould be held responsible. The subject was debated with considerable\r\nfeeling on both sides. The governor remained at Jolo twenty-seven\r\ndays and returned without advantage.\r\n\r\nThe treaty was never ratified by Great Britain, but such endeavors on\r\nthe part of a strong maritime European power made it necessary for\r\nSpain to act decisively and expeditiously. Urbiztondo then pressed\r\nto the attention of Sultan Pulalun and his council the necessity of\r\npunishing the Samals of Tonkil for their depredations on Samar and\r\nKamigin and requested the return of the captives whom they carried\r\naway. Considerable controversy followed and the Sulus pretended that\r\nthey were unable to punish Tonkil, but offered no objection to its\r\ncastigation by the Philippine Government.\r\n\r\nAware of the seriousness of the situation, Urbiztondo made preparations\r\nfor war and decided to attack not Tonkil only, but Jolo also, repeating\r\nthere the example of Balangingi, and to bring Sulu under the control\r\nof Spain. Referring to this cause, Captain Keppel, in his \"Visit to\r\nthe Indian Archipelago,\" makes the following remarks:\r\n\r\n\r\n    His [the Sultan's] fortified position gave him weight, which he\r\n    had frequently thrown into the scale of humanity: and it must\r\n    now be feared that many whom he was able to hold in check will\r\n    again follow their evil propensities unrestrained, as they did\r\n    under previous dynasties.\r\n\r\n    The resentment of Spain, as visited upon the Sultan of Sulu, seems\r\n    equally impolitic and unjust. The pretext was piracy, of which\r\n    some solitary instance may very possibly have been established\r\n    against a Sulu prahu; but the Sultan was certainly sincere in his\r\n    wish to coöperate against that system. There is ground to fear\r\n    that national jealousy was desirous of striking its puny blow\r\n    at an European rival, through the degradation of the Sultan of\r\n    Sulu--that he has incurred, in fact, the resentment of the Spanish\r\n    colonial governors, by those commercial treaties with ourselves\r\n    which were but lately concluded by Sir James Brooke. [211]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 11th day of December, 1850, Urbiztondo left Manila in command\r\nof a force consisting of 100 troops of artillery, 500 of infantry, 2\r\nmountain howitzers, and a number of irregular troops and workmen. Two\r\nsteamboats, one corvette, and one brigantine carried the troops\r\nto Zamboanga, where they arrived on the 20th. Here 2 companies of\r\ninfantry and 102 volunteers and 6 tenders under the command of the\r\ngovernor of Zamboanga joined the expedition. At Belun they burned\r\n250 houses and 20 vintas. A small force of Moros was encountered,\r\nof which they killed 3 and captured 17 prisoners, one of whom was a\r\npanglima. The chief of Bukutwan surrendered and promised to remain\r\nobedient to Spain. At Tonkil bad weather was encountered and the\r\nwhole expedition turned toward Jolo.\r\n\r\nJolo was well fortified. It had five forts on the sea front, the\r\nstrongest two of which were that of the Sultan on the right and that of\r\nDatu Daniel on the hill. Three other forts were located on prominent\r\npoints at the base of the hills. The town was further defended by a\r\ndouble line of trenches, other fortifications and much artillery. The\r\npopulation was estimated at 6,000 Moros and 500 Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe fleet saluted the town and anchored in the roadstead. Two\r\nofficers were sent ashore to notify the Sultan of the presence of\r\nthe Governor-General and of his wish to have an interview with the\r\nSultan and two of his datus, on board. The people were excited to such\r\na high degree, that the mob grew violent and uncontrollable as the\r\nofficers drew near the shore. Insults and weapons were hurled at them\r\nfrom every side, and the people shouted to them to return lest they be\r\nkilled. They, however, pushed on in the direction of the Sultan's fort,\r\nwhere some datus came out to meet and protect them. Even then spears\r\nwere thrown at them, and one of the datus had to use his kampilan in\r\norder to enforce his orders. The Sultan at last came out personally,\r\nembraced the officers, and conducted them to the audience hall. There\r\nthe message was delivered to the Sultan and his council, but they\r\nall refused to go on board. The officers met the same difficulty\r\nin leaving the Sultan's house as in coming in, and as soon as they\r\nembarked five shots were discharged at them by the mob. The officers\r\nreported that the town had more than 10,000 fighting men and that\r\nit was well provisioned and well defended, and that all the women\r\nand children were removed to the mountains. Urbiztondo decided that\r\nhis forces and provisions were inadequate for the occasion and did\r\nnot risk a combat. On January 1, 1851, as the fleet was preparing to\r\nsail away, the Sulus fired at it, killing seven, wounding four, and\r\ndamaging the hulls of some of the vessels. The fleet returned the fire,\r\nbut kept moving, and sailed away in the direction of Tonkil. Here\r\nthe expedition met no organized resistance. Six hundred men were\r\ndisembarked, fought some armed parties, caught 4 and killed 25 men,\r\nand rescued 29 captives. About 1,000 houses and 106 boats were burned,\r\nand the fleet then returned to Zamboanga.\r\n\r\nHere Urbiztondo made further and extensive preparations to strengthen\r\nhis expedition. The commanding marine officer was sent to Manila\r\nwith special instructions to augment the fleet and bring sufficient\r\nammunition and provisions. The Augustinian friar Pascual Ibañez\r\nraised a force of 750 Cebuans and 21 barangay, or large boats, and\r\nvolunteered his help. Lumber was cut at Basilan, and lankan, [212]\r\nrafts, and ladders were constructed. Volunteers were further called\r\nfor, and a large fleet of war vessels and transports was assembled\r\nat Zamboanga February 12, 1851.\r\n\r\nBesides the staff, engineers, surgeons, and chaplains, the reënforced\r\nexpedition contained 11 officers and 253 privates of artillery, 1\r\nofficer and 30 privates of sappers, 123 officers and 2,593 privates\r\nof infantry, 525 volunteers from Cebu, 100 from Iloilo, and 300 from\r\nZamboanga; in all 142 officers, 2,876 privates, and 925 volunteers,\r\nbesides rowers and other workmen. The vessels carrying the forces\r\nwere 1 corvette, 1 brigantine, 3 steamboats, 2 gunboats, 9 tenders,\r\n9 transports, and 21 barangay, with various vintas, [213] lankan,\r\nand rafts. On February 19 mass was celebrated and the expedition\r\nstarted for the haughty and arrogant city.\r\n\r\nJolo was reached on the 27th and the fleet anchored in two divisions\r\nopposite both sides of the town. The troops disembarked at dawn next\r\nmorning and engaged the enemy as both divisions of the fleet began\r\na simultaneous bombardment of the town and forts. The marksmanship\r\nof the Sulus and Spaniards was splendid, and the guns of the forts\r\nwere very active. The spectacle was magnificent, the attack was most\r\nvalorous, and the defense most valiant. In the heat of battle one\r\nfriar was killed as he was scaling the wall and three officers fell\r\nby his side and lay surrounded by 70 corpses of Sulus. After several\r\nattempts one of the forts on the northeast side was taken by storm and\r\nthe escaping Sulus made for Daniel's fort. As they were admitted into\r\nthe latter, it was rushed by the Spanish troops who entered in spite\r\nof the desperate resistance the Sulus made. As the inner inclosure was\r\ngained the Sulus hurled themselves from the parapets and fled. The\r\nfighting continued until next day, when every fort was reduced, and\r\nthe Sulus evacuated the town. The casualties of the attacking forces\r\nwere 36 dead and 92 wounded, while the Sulus lost 300 dead. The whole\r\ntown was burned to ashes and 112 pieces of artillery were taken. After\r\nfour days, the Governor-General and his council decided to evacuate\r\nthe town and sailed away, leaving it ungarrisoned. They evidently\r\nthought that their purpose was accomplished and that they could not\r\nafford to leave a force sufficiently strong to defend the place.\r\n\r\nOn April 30 a treaty was made with Sultan Pulalun by the\r\npolitico-military governor of Zamboanga, Col. José Maria de Carlos. The\r\ntreaty was declared to be \"an act of incorporation of the sultanate\r\nof Sulu to the Spanish Monarchy.\" The Sulus understood it to be a firm\r\nagreement and friendly union with Spain. They, however, appear to have\r\nrecognized the supremacy of Spain and accepted her protectorate. They\r\nagreed to use the Spanish flag and prohibit piracy. They further\r\nbound themselves not to make any treaties with any nation other\r\nthan Spain nor to build forts nor to import firearms without her\r\npermission. Spain promised to respect and recognize the ranks of\r\nthe Sultan and datus and to protect Sulu boats everywhere and to\r\nthe same extent as Spanish boats. Duties on foreign boats were to\r\nbe paid to the Sulus. Religious liberty was guaranteed. The Sultan\r\nissued passports to the Sulus and countersigned Spanish passports\r\ngiven to people entering the ports of Sulu.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that Spain would build a trading post at Jolo and\r\nestablish a small garrison for its protection. The Sultan and the\r\ndatus resumed their residence in the town of Jolo, with apparently\r\nvery little change from former conditions.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of the losses incurred by the Sultan and datus\r\nthrough the destruction of their houses and town, and on condition\r\nthat the Sulus aid in the construction and protection of the Jolo\r\ntrading post, annuities were granted to the Sultan, three datus,\r\nand one subordinate chief.\r\n\r\nThe treaty was written in both Spanish and Sulu and was signed and\r\nsealed by both parties. Complete and exact translations of the Spanish\r\nand Sulu copies of this treaty have been carefully made and are here\r\ngiven in full. The Sulu copy of the treaty appears to have been written\r\nor dictated by interpreters not versed in Sulu, and the difference in\r\ntext is such as would easily explain the frequent misunderstandings\r\nbetween the Spanish officials and the Sulu authorities in cases\r\npertaining to the application of the terms of this treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATY OF APRIL 30, 1851\r\n\r\n\r\n    SULTANATE OF SULU\r\n\r\n    Act of Incorporation into the Spanish Monarchy, April 30, 1851\r\n\r\n\r\n    Solemn declaration of incorporation and adhesion to the Sovereignty\r\n    of Her Catholic Majesty Isabel II, Constitutional Queen of Spain,\r\n    and of submission to the Supreme Government of the Nation, made\r\n    by His High Excellency the Sultan of Sulu, Mohammed Pulalun,\r\n    Datus Mohammed Buyuk, Muluk, Daniel Amil Bahar, Bandahala, Muluk\r\n    Kahar, Amil Badar, Tumanggung, Juhan, Sanajahan, Na'ib, Mamancha\r\n    and Sharif Mohammed Binsarin, in the name and in representation\r\n    of the whole island of Sulu, to Colonel José María de Carlos y\r\n    O'Doyle, Politico-Military Governor of the Province of Zamboanga,\r\n    islands of Basilan, Pilas, Tonkil, and those adjacent thereto,\r\n    as Plenipotentiary specially authorized by His Excellency Antonio\r\n    de Urbiztondo, Marquis of Solana, Governor and Captain-General\r\n    of the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\n    Article I. His Excellency the Sultan of Sulu, for himself, his\r\n    heirs and descendants, Datus Mohammed Buyuk, Muluk, Daniel Amil\r\n    Bahar, Bandahala, Muluk Kahar, Amil Badar, Tumanggung, Juhan,\r\n    Sanajahan, Na'ib, Mamancha and Sharif Mohammed Binsarin, all of\r\n    their own free will, declare: That, for the purpose of making\r\n    amends to the Spanish Nation for the outrage committed against\r\n    it on the first of January of this year, they desire and request\r\n    that the island of Jolo and all its dependencies be incorporated\r\n    with the Crown of Spain, which for several centuries has been\r\n    their only sovereign and protectress, making on this day a new\r\n    solemn declaration of adhesion and submission and recognizing\r\n    Her Catholic Majesty Isabel II, Constitutional Queen of Spain,\r\n    and those who may succeed her in this supreme dignity, as their\r\n    rightful Sovereign Lords and Protectors, in virtue of the treaties\r\n    made in old times, of the treaty of 1836 and the additions made\r\n    thereto by the present governor of Zamboanga in August, and also\r\n    and very particularly of the recent conquest of Jolo on the 28th of\r\n    February of the present year by Captain-General Antonio Urbiztondo,\r\n    Marquis of Solana and Governor-General of the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\n    Article 2. The Sultan and Datus solemnly promise to maintain the\r\n    integrity of the territory of Sulu and all its dependencies as\r\n    a part of the Archipelago belonging to the Spanish Government.\r\n\r\n    Article 3. The island of Sulu and all its dependencies having been\r\n    incorporated with the Crown of Spain, and the inhabitants thereof\r\n    being part of the great Spanish family which lives in the vast\r\n    Philippine Archipelago, the Sultan and Datus shall not be empowered\r\n    to make or sign treaties, commercial agreements or alliances of\r\n    any kind with European powers, companies, persons or corporations,\r\n    and Malayan sultans or chiefs, under pain of nullity; they declare\r\n    all treaties made with other powers to be null and void if they\r\n    are prejudicial to the ancient and indisputable rights held by\r\n    Spain over the entire Sulu Archipelago as part of the Philippine\r\n    Islands, and they ratify, renew and leave in force all documents\r\n    containing clauses favorable to the Spanish Government that may\r\n    have been drawn up before this date, however old they may be.\r\n\r\n    Article 4. They renew the solemn promise not to carry on piracy\r\n    or allow anybody to carry on piracy within the dominions of Sulu,\r\n    and to run down those who follow this infamous calling, declaring\r\n    themselves enemies of all islands that are enemies of Spain and\r\n    allies of all her friends.\r\n\r\n    Article 5. From this day forth the island of Sulu shall fly the\r\n    Spanish national flag in its towns and on its ships, and the Sultan\r\n    and other constituted authorities shall use the Spanish war flag,\r\n    under the principles in use in other Spanish possessions, and\r\n    shall use no other either on land or on sea.\r\n\r\n    Article 6. The island of Sulu and its dependencies having been\r\n    declared an integral part of the Philippine Archipelago, which\r\n    belongs to Spain, commerce under the Spanish flag in all the\r\n    ports of the Sultanate shall be free and unmolested, as it is in\r\n    all the ports belonging to the Nation.\r\n\r\n    Article 7. The Sultan and Datus of Sulu, having recognized the\r\n    sovereignty of Spain over their territory, which sovereignty is\r\n    now strongly established, not only by right of conquest but by\r\n    the clemency of the conqueror, they shall not erect fortifications\r\n    of any kind in the territory under their command without express\r\n    permission of His Excellency the Governor-General of these Islands;\r\n    the purchase and use of all kinds of firearms shall be prohibited\r\n    except with a license issued by the same supreme authority,\r\n    and craft found with arms other than the edged weapons which\r\n    have from time immemorial been in use in the country shall be\r\n    considered as enemies.\r\n\r\n    Article 8. The Spanish Government, as an unequivocal proof of\r\n    the protection which it grants the Sulus, will give the Sultan\r\n    and Datus adequate Royal titles establishing their authority and\r\n    their rank.\r\n\r\n    Article 9. The Spanish Government guarantees with all solemnity\r\n    to the Sultan and other inhabitants of Sulu the free exercise of\r\n    their religion, with which it will not interfere in the slightest\r\n    way, and it will also respect their customs.\r\n\r\n    Article 10. The Spanish Government also guarantees the right\r\n    of succession to the present Sultan and his descendants in the\r\n    order established and as long as they observe these agreements,\r\n    and equally guarantees the rank and dignities of the privileged\r\n    classes, which shall retain all their rights.\r\n\r\n    Article 11. Sulu ships and goods shall enjoy in Spanish ports,\r\n    without any distinction whatever, the same privileges and\r\n    advantages granted the natives of the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\n    Article 12. Except in the case of Spanish ships, the duties that\r\n    constitute the income with which the Sultan and Datus maintain\r\n    their respective ranks shall remain in force, so that they may\r\n    continue to keep up the proper splendor and decorum of their\r\n    station; for this purpose said duties shall be paid by all ships\r\n    coming to their ports; other measures will be taken later on to\r\n    enhance their dignity and increase their prestige.\r\n\r\n    Article 13. For the purpose of assuring and strengthening the\r\n    authority of the Sultan, and also of promoting a regular trade\r\n    which may enrich the island of Sulu, a trading post, garrisoned by\r\n    Spanish forces, shall be established as soon as the Government so\r\n    orders, and in accordance with Article 3 of the Treaty of 1836;\r\n    for the building of the trading post the Sultan, Datus, and\r\n    natives shall give all the assistance in their power and furnish\r\n    native labor, which will be paid for, and all necessary materials,\r\n    which they will charge at the regular market prices.\r\n\r\n    Article 14. The trading post shall be established at the place\r\n    called Daniel's Kuta, next to the roadstead, as it is the most\r\n    suitable place; but care shall be taken not to encroach in any way\r\n    on the native cemetery, which has to be religiously respected, and\r\n    no buildings whatever shall be erected in said cemetery, so as to\r\n    avoid the trouble that would ensue to those who might build there.\r\n\r\n    Article 15. The Sultan of Sulu may issue passports to all persons\r\n    within his dominions that may request them, and fix the amount\r\n    of the fees; he is also authorized to countersign or place his\r\n    seal on the passports of Spaniards visiting his place of residence.\r\n\r\n    Article 16. In view of the Sultan's declarations regarding the\r\n    losses suffered by him in the destruction by fire of his forts\r\n    and palace, and convinced of the reality of the losses, the\r\n    Spanish Government grants him an annuity of 1,500 pesos in order\r\n    to indemnify him in a certain way for these losses and at the same\r\n    time to help him to maintain, with proper splendor, the decorum due\r\n    his person and his rank. The same considerations induce the Spanish\r\n    Government to grant Datu Mohammed Buyuk, Muluk and Datu Daniel Amil\r\n    Bahar 600 pesos per annum each, and 360 pesos to Sharif Mohammed\r\n    Binsarin on account of his good services to the Spanish Government.\r\n\r\n    Article 17.

The Mahasari Mawlana Sultan of Sulu and his ministers\r\n    together with the datus mentioned above have the great desire to\r\n    state that they had good intentions toward the people of Spain,\r\n    on January 1, of this year. They also state that the relation\r\n    of Sulu and its dependencies to Spain has been one of intimate\r\n    union from the first until now.\r\n\r\n    They make anew, to-day, a firm agreement of union in friendship\r\n    with the Queen of Spain Isabel II, Constitutional Queen of All\r\n    Spain, and all her honorable officers, to reaffirm the previous\r\n    agreement of 1836, as also the agreement of last year made with\r\n    the governor of Zamboanga, in the month of August, which fully\r\n    affirmed the \"Kunkista\" [214] of Sulu which was effected on the\r\n    28th of February, this year, by Señor the excellent Don Antonio\r\n    Urbiztondo, Marquis of Solana, Governor and great Captain of the\r\n    Philippine Archipelago.\r\n\r\n    Article II. The Sultan and Datus promise with firm intention and\r\n    brotherhood not to revoke their agreement to the occupation of\r\n    Sulu and its dependencies, regarding them as dependencies of Spain.\r\n\r\n    Article III. Sulu and her dependencies alike use the Spanish flag;\r\n    the people of Sulu and her dependencies are one with the people\r\n    of Spain, and ally themselves to the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\n    It shall not be right for the Sultan and the Datus to make treaties\r\n    with Malay datus or any nation other than Spain, whether that\r\n    nation is Spain's ally or not. Should such treaties be made they\r\n    would be null. So also they can not make any contracts with any\r\n    persons other than Spaniards, nor any agreement contrary to the\r\n    previous ones. Such agreements, if made, will not be binding\r\n    because Spain is in all the islands of Sulu as she is in her\r\n    Philippine Islands, and Sulu has previous friendship treaties\r\n    with Spain.\r\n\r\n    Article IV. New promise: Pirates shall not be allowed at all\r\n    here in Sulu. Should they commit any crime they shall be punished\r\n    wherever they may be.\r\n\r\n    Article V. The subordinate rulers, and all boats, from this day\r\n    on, shall use the Spanish flag, but the Sultan and the Datus can\r\n    use a war flag like the Spanish officials. They will not use any\r\n    other flag.\r\n\r\n    Article VI. The Island of Sulu and all its dependencies large\r\n    and small, being the same as the Philippine Islands in that they\r\n    belong to Spain, all Spanish officers and all ships flying the\r\n    Spanish flag may navigate through the Sulu Archipelago without\r\n    any objection.\r\n\r\n    Article VII. It is recognized by the Sultan and the Datus that\r\n    the King of Spain is powerful these days and is just and merciful\r\n    in acquiring \"Kunkista,\" and that it is not right to build forts\r\n    without informing the Spanish Government nor to buy arms without\r\n    having also informed the Spanish Government, nor to have boats\r\n    carry any arms except the kris and the spear, for other arms are\r\n    signs of enmity.\r\n\r\n    Article VIII. The Spanish Government, wishing to promote fellowship\r\n    with the people of Sulu, gives the sultan and the datus titulu\r\n    (titles) to increase their respect and honor.\r\n\r\n    Article IX. The Spanish Government assures the Sultan and all\r\n    the people that it will let their religion alone, and that it\r\n    will not try to change their religion, nor object to the free\r\n    exercise of their worship and the customs of their race.\r\n\r\n    Article X. The Spanish Government does also promise the people and\r\n    the Sultan that it will not break its word. It also promises to\r\n    recognize the ranks of the Sultan and the Datus, and also those\r\n    of subordinate rulers and the people.\r\n\r\n    Article XI. Sulu boats and goods may go to Spanish countries\r\n    without any objection, in the same manner as if they belonged to\r\n    that country.\r\n\r\n    Article XII. All ships that come to Sulu, except those of Spain,\r\n    pay duties as previously, in order that the Sultan and the Datus\r\n    may get a share of the income of their towns, and may adopt\r\n    measures which will improve and benefit the town.\r\n\r\n    Article XIII. If the power of the Sultan is well established and\r\n    sustained, he may be able to secure other profits besides this,\r\n    by helping the Spanish Government, in accordance with Article 3\r\n    of the treaty of 1836, providing for the building of a trading\r\n    post which would be guarded by Spain. It will be proper for the\r\n    Sultan and the Datus to help in the erection of this trading post,\r\n    and all labor and lumber shall be paid for according to the custom\r\n    of the place.\r\n\r\n    Article XIV. This trading post shall be built near the site of\r\n    the fort of Amil Bahar. [215] It shall not encroach upon nor\r\n    cause any injury to the cemetery of the Mohammedans, but out of\r\n    due respect to their religion no house shall be erected there,\r\n    and in case any be erected it shall be destroyed.\r\n\r\n    Article XV. The Sultan of Sulu has the right to give passports\r\n    to all of his people who request it, sign those which he issues,\r\n    and countersign Spanish passports coming to Sulu.\r\n\r\n    Article XVI. The Spanish Government, forgiving the previous\r\n    offenses of the Sultan, and in consideration of the destruction by\r\n    fire of his palace and his fort, grants the Sultan a yearly sum\r\n    of P1,500 as a help and an indemnity for his losses. The Spanish\r\n    Government also grants to each of the Datus Mohammed Buyuk, Muluk,\r\n    and Amil Bahar, P600 a year, and to Tuan Sharif Mohammed Binsarin\r\n    P360 on account of his good services to Spain.\r\n\r\n    Article XVII. The articles of this treaty shall take effect\r\n    to-day. They shall be shown to the Captain-General of the\r\n    Philippine Islands lest he would not agree to them. They are also\r\n    in Spanish.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis treaty gained its purpose in that it checkmated the agreement\r\nof Sir James Brooke, but it certainly did not receive as much\r\nconsideration at Jolo and Zamboanga as it did at Madrid and London. Its\r\neffect was temporary only. As early as 1854 a town on Kapul was burned\r\nby the Spanish forces from Basilan. In 1855 the Sulus made a dash upon\r\nZamboanga and burned the best part of the town. The \"Light Fleet\"\r\nissued from Isabela de Basilan in 1857, surprised Simisa, rescued\r\n76 captives, and took 116 prisoners. The chiefs against whom the\r\nexpedition was directed presented themselves later to the governor of\r\nZamboanga and exchanged the Moro prisoners for 60 Christian captives,\r\n1 priest, and 1 European woman. Many pirates continued to scour the\r\nremote parts of the Archipelago. In 1858 Governor-General Norzagaray\r\npublished a proclamation calling the attention of chiefs of provinces\r\nand municipalities to the approach of the season at which the pirates\r\nappear, and invoking their aid to caution the people and to take proper\r\nmeasures for the defense of their towns. Rewards were also offered for\r\ncatching or killing pirates and for seizing their boats wherever found,\r\nbut this had no important effect. In 1860 about 400 Moros raided the\r\nStraits of San Bernardino and plundered several settlements.\r\n\r\nThe year 1861 marks a new era in the history of piracy and a new\r\nstep in the organization of government for Mindanao and Basilan. At\r\nthis time Spain and the Philippines were passing through a period of\r\nprogress. Alive to the truth that commerce and piracy can not coexist,\r\nthe government provided a competent naval force by which it was able\r\nto maintain unquestionable supremacy in the Sulu Sea. It purchased\r\neighteen steam vessels in England and used them for chasing Moro\r\npirates and for blockading the port of Jolo. The operations conducted\r\nby these vessels drove away hordes of pirates from Philippine waters,\r\nand, in the course of a decade, terminated that long term of piracy\r\nunder which the Islands had suffered for three centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICO-MILITARY GOVERNMENT OF MINDANAO AND ADJACENT ISLANDS\r\n\r\nAffairs in Mindanao had progressed so satisfactorily that Pollok,\r\nKotabato, and Davao were occupied by permanent garrisons, and peace\r\nand tranquillity reigned over the Celebes Sea. A politico-military\r\ngovernment was then established for all the pacified territory\r\nof Mindanao and Basilan, and was designated as the Government\r\nof Mindanao. It comprised six districts, the first five of which\r\nbelonged entirely to the Island of Mindanao. The sixth was called the\r\ndistrict of Basilan and was defined as \"comprising Basilan and the\r\nSpanish possessions in the Archipelago of Sulu.\" Sulu was not brought\r\nunder this organization until 1878, when an additional district was\r\ncreated for this purpose. The form of this government and its chief\r\ncharacteristics are best described in the words of the royal order\r\ncreating it, which is herein given in full because of many points\r\nof interest which are contained in the text and form of the decree,\r\nand which can not be well illustrated otherwise:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Superior Civil Government\r\n\r\n    Office of the Deputy Superintendent of the Philippine Treasury\r\n\r\n    CIRCULAR\r\n\r\n    The Minister of War and Colonies communicated to this Superior\r\n    Civil Government, on the 31st of July of last year, the following\r\n    Royal order:\r\n\r\n    Your Excellency: The Queen (whom God protect) has been pleased\r\n    to issue the following Royal decree: Pursuant to the reasons laid\r\n    before me by the Minister of War and Colonies, and in accordance\r\n    with the opinion of the Council of Ministers, I hereby decree\r\n    the following:\r\n\r\n    Article I. A politico-military Government is hereby established\r\n    for the island of Mindanao and adjacent islands.\r\n\r\n    Article II. The Government of Mindanao shall be divided into six\r\n    districts: 1. the Zamboanga District, formed of that part of the\r\n    province of the same name which includes all of Sibugay Bay,\r\n    and the west coast of the island as far as Murciélagos Point;\r\n    2. the District of the North, including, in the northern part of\r\n    the island, all the territory between the boundary line of the 1st\r\n    District and Dapitan Point, on Tutwan Bay; 3. the Eastern District,\r\n    between Dapitan Point, and Karaga Bay; 4. the Davao District,\r\n    beginning on the boundary line of the 3d District and including\r\n    the Bay of Davao and all the southern extremity of the island;\r\n    5. the Central District, including Illana Bay, situated between the\r\n    1st and 4th districts; 6. the District of Basilan, comprising the\r\n    Spanish possessions in the Archipelagoes of Sulu and Basilan. The\r\n    capital of the Government shall be in the Central District,\r\n    the most advantageous place at the mouth of the Mindanao River\r\n    being chosen. These districts shall be divided into two classes;\r\n    to the first class shall belong the Northern, Central and Eastern\r\n    districts, and to the second those of Zamboanga, Davao and Basilan.\r\n\r\n    Article III. The Governor of Mindanao shall receive 6,000 pesos\r\n    as salary, and 2,000 pesos as entertainment fund. The latter\r\n    shall be supplied from the revenues from Government real estate\r\n    and licenses. The Governor's residence shall also be supplied by\r\n    the State.\r\n\r\n    Article IV. This Governorship shall correspond to the class of\r\n    brigadier generals; but the first Governor appointed may be a\r\n    colonel, who will be entitled, as a reward, to an appointment as\r\n    brigadier general after three years.\r\n\r\n    Article V. The Governor of Mindanao shall be succeeded in\r\n    his command by the officer of the highest rank in the island,\r\n    pending the appointment of another Governor, or such action\r\n    as the Captain General may deem advisable. In the districts,\r\n    the Governor shall be succeeded by the officer next in rank,\r\n    until the Governor of Mindanao appoints an Acting Governor and\r\n    requests the Captain General to take such action as may be called\r\n    for by the regulations in force.\r\n\r\n    Article VI. The duties and powers of the Captain General in\r\n    regard to the Government of Mindanao, and those of the Governor of\r\n    the island, shall be the same as those provided for the Bisayas\r\n    in my Royal decree of this date. As military authorities, they\r\n    shall observe the usual relations between Captains General and\r\n    Commanders General of Provinces. The Governor of Mindanao shall\r\n    forward each month to the Captain General of the Philippines a\r\n    tabulated record of the resolutions taken by him in the exercise\r\n    of his authority, so that the latter may be able to exercise with\r\n    efficiency the general supervision to which he is entitled. The\r\n    Captain General shall forward to the Supreme Government, through\r\n    the proper channels, both this tabulated record, and a statement\r\n    of the action he has taken in the premises.\r\n\r\n    Article VII. The districts of the first class shall be governed by\r\n    lieutenant-colonels and those of the second class by senior majors.\r\n\r\n    Article VIII. The duties of these district governors shall be\r\n    those specified, up to the present time, for the politico-military\r\n    Governors of the island.\r\n\r\n    Article IX. The Governor of Mindanao shall have a Secretariate\r\n    with the following personnel: a Secretary at 2,500 pesos per year;\r\n    one clerk, class one, at 1,200; one clerk, class two, at 1,000,\r\n    and one clerk, class three, at 800. 1,000 pesos are furthermore\r\n    provided for the salaries of copyists, and 500 for office supplies.\r\n\r\n    Article X. There is hereby created for Mindanao a Revenue Office\r\n    which shall serve as depositary of the revenues, and shall have\r\n    charge of collecting all taxes, and of the administration of the\r\n    Army. It shall have the following personnel: an Administrator at\r\n    2,500 pesos; a Controller at 2,000; one clerk, class one, at 1,000;\r\n    two clerks, class two, at 800, and a cashier at 800. 1,500 pesos\r\n    are provided for the salaries of copyists and other auxiliary\r\n    employees, and 600 for office supplies.\r\n\r\n    Article XI. The chiefs of districts shall remain in charge of\r\n    the collection of taxes in the manner hitherto established, and\r\n    shall be entitled to the allowances provided for that purpose. The\r\n    provisions of this article shall not interfere with those already\r\n    made for the departments of the administration which exist at\r\n    the present time in Mindanao and their dependencies.\r\n\r\n    Article XII. For expediting their official business the district\r\n    governors shall have a secretary at a salary of 800 pesos in\r\n    districts of the first class, and 600 in those of the second\r\n    class. To each secretary's office 75 pesos are assigned for office\r\n    supplies, and 150 for a copyist.\r\n\r\n    Article XIII. The mission of the Jesuits, which has already been\r\n    sent to Mindanao, shall look after the spiritual wants of the\r\n    island, and Jesuits shall take the place of the other priests as\r\n    soon as the mission has a sufficient personnel, and in the manner\r\n    which may be deemed most convenient.\r\n\r\n    Article XIV. The first and principal object of the mission shall\r\n    be to secure the conversion of the races which have not yet been\r\n    subjected, and even after the parishes of the island are provided\r\n    for it shall maintain a sufficient number of missionaries for\r\n    that purpose; each missionary shall be aided to the extent of\r\n    800 pesos a year from the Royal Treasury.\r\n\r\n    Article XV. The War and Navy Departments, together with the\r\n    Colonial Office, shall decide what forces of the army and navy are\r\n    required for Mindanao; the Captain-General shall have authority\r\n    to make such changes as the circumstances may require, but he\r\n    shall always report such changes to the respective Ministers\r\n    for approval.\r\n\r\n    Article XVI. The Governor can use the naval forces whenever he\r\n    finds it necessary, with the assent of the commanding officer\r\n    thereof.\r\n\r\n    Article XVII. It shall be the constant duty of the army to explore\r\n    and to occupy the country; for that purpose, two columns at least\r\n    shall be detached each year from each district, and go through\r\n    said districts in different directions. The chiefs of these columns\r\n    shall make out a report about the territory reconnoitered by them;\r\n    said reports shall be included in a general report made by the\r\n    Governor, which shall be forwarded to the Department of War and\r\n    Colonies through the Captain-General of the Philippines; this\r\n    information will allow the Governor to give, in the following\r\n    years his instructions to the columns sent out to explore the\r\n    country, without losing sight of the advantage of establishing\r\n    friendly relations with the tribes which inhabit the island, and\r\n    the necessity of maintaining communication between the different\r\n    districts. These columns shall be provided with everything that may\r\n    be required to overcome the obstacles they will find on their way;\r\n    and during the expedition, officers and soldiers shall receive\r\n    field rations, issued in kind, according to the advice of the\r\n    Military Health Department. For this purpose 10,000 pesos shall\r\n    be carried on the budget for the first year, and 100 pesos shall\r\n    be given for each expedition to the officer commanding a column,\r\n    for extraordinary expenses.\r\n\r\n    Article XVIII. Two special agents shall be appointed by the\r\n    government for the purpose of studying means of developing all\r\n    the natural resources of the island of Mindanao.\r\n\r\n    Article XIX. In order to encourage colonists to settle in such\r\n    parts of the island as may be deemed best, they will be furnished,\r\n    at their request, the tools and implements required for their\r\n    work or trade. The Governor is furthermore authorized to pay\r\n    the traveling expenses of colonists who may wish to settle in\r\n    the island without exceeding the sum hereinafter provided, the\r\n    expenditure of which shall be duly accounted for. The new settlers\r\n    shall be entitled to the foregoing privileges for ten years,\r\n    and 12,000 pesos shall be appropriated for that purpose during\r\n    the first year, from the revenues accruing from government real\r\n    estate and licenses. The new settlers shall be exempt from tribute;\r\n    the same favor shall be granted all tribes that submit peacefully.\r\n\r\n    Article XX. The laws and regulations in force in the other islands\r\n    of the Philippines shall be observed in all the offices of the\r\n    Treasury Department. The prohibitions mentioned in the tariff\r\n    shall apply to the custom house of Zamboanga; articles imported\r\n    into the island in Spanish bottoms, and for local consumption,\r\n    shall pay, during the next ten years, 2 per cent ad valorem, if\r\n    of Spanish origin and 5 per cent if of foreign origin. If brought\r\n    under a foreign flag said articles shall pay double the amounts\r\n    specified above. If, after importing an article for use in the\r\n    island, it is reëxported to some other Spanish island, it shall\r\n    pay, on arrival at the latter the difference between what has been\r\n    paid in Mindanao and the regular duty established in the tariff.\r\n\r\n    Article XXI. Lands now under cultivation, and those placed under\r\n    cultivation during the next ten years, shall pay no other impost\r\n    than that required by the regulations now in force, per quiñon\r\n    of land, as an acknowledgment of ownership. [216]\r\n\r\n    Article XXII. The Government shall always have on hand a reserve\r\n    fund of 10,000 pesos to meet any urgent and unexpected need\r\n    that may arise; in such cases only, the Governor shall assume\r\n    the responsibility of using this sum, or part of the same, and\r\n    shall account for the expenditure, in the usual manner.\r\n\r\n    Article XXIII. A sum of 3,000 pesos per year is placed at the\r\n    disposal of the Governor for presents to the independent tribes,\r\n    for the purpose of gaining their friendship; the same amount\r\n    is assigned to the mission of the Jesuits. These funds shall be\r\n    expended and accounted for in the best possible form.\r\n\r\n    Article XXIV. For the expenses of installation a special estimate\r\n    shall be drawn up, and action shall be taken thereon as provided\r\n    by the laws for urgent cases.\r\n\r\n    Article XXV. No extra pay or allowances of any kind shall be\r\n    given except such as are provided in the present decree, and the\r\n    per diems usually granted military engineers when they are sent\r\n    out on official business.\r\n\r\n    Article XXVI. The War, Navy, and Colonies Departments shall execute\r\n    the present Decree in the parts which respectively concern them,\r\n    and shall work in common for the execution of such parts thereof\r\n    as may belong to two or more Departments.\r\n\r\n    Article XXVII. So many of the laws and orders in force as are\r\n    inconsistent with the provisions of the present decree are hereby\r\n    repealed.\r\n\r\n    Given at San Ildefonso on the 30th of July, 1860.\r\n\r\n    Rubric of Her Majesty.--The Minister of War and Colonies. Leopoldo\r\n    O'Donnell.--Communicated to you by Royal order for your information\r\n    and action.\r\n\r\n\r\nSultan Pulalun was regarded by the Sulus as an able administrator\r\nand a just ruler. His influence and fame and that of his father\r\nendeared the house of Jamalul Kiram to the people to such an extent\r\nas to restrict the succession of the sultanate to their direct line\r\nof descent for a considerable period of time. Following the steps of\r\nhis father, he published a revised code of Sulu laws and conducted\r\nthe affairs of his government with care. Pulalun died September 24,\r\n1862, and was followed by his son, Jamalul A`lam.\r\n\r\nThe succession of Jamalul A`lam was contested by Datu Jamalul Kiram,\r\nthe grandson of Sultan Shakirul Lah. The wife of Datu Jamalul\r\nKiram was the daughter of Datu Daniel Amil Bahar, and the latter\r\nwas inclined to support his son-in-law. Jamalul A`lam, however, had\r\nthe majority of the council of the datus on his side, and a Spanish\r\ncommission sent to Jolo in November, confirmed his sultanate. Espina\r\nstates that at that time the sultan was living with Datu Asibi, and\r\nthat the portrait of Queen Isabel II was placed before the sultan\r\nwhen he made his declaration before the commission to recognize the\r\nauthority and sovereignty of Spain over all the dominions of Sulu,\r\nincluding her dependencies in Borneo.\r\n\r\nIt is noted in the Sulu Annals, under date of February 1, 1867, that\r\na Spanish war vessel arrived at Jolo and demanded the punishment and\r\ndelivery of three men, one of whom was called Imam Mindang. The sultan\r\narrested all these men and had them executed on February 9 in the\r\npresence of the officer in command of the vessel. It appears that in\r\nspite of the vigilance of the Spanish navy, piratical expeditions were\r\nkept up by discontented Moros not fully submissive to the sultan. This\r\nled to further activity on the part of Spanish gunboats, and war was\r\nconsequently carried into Sulu waters and territory.\r\n\r\nAnother note in the Sulu Annals, under date of March 5, 1872, states\r\nthat 13 Spanish vessels attacked Jolo, killed 3 men and 1 woman\r\nand lost 2 officers and 100 soldiers. That same year the famous\r\nwarrior Datu Daniel Amil Bahar died; and Puerta Princesa, capital\r\nof Palawan, was garrisoned by native troops. A naval blockade of\r\nJolo was established and hostilities between Sulu and Spain were\r\nresumed. In 1873-1875 considerable damage was done by the fleet\r\nthroughout the Archipelago, and two German vessels were seized while\r\ncarrying contraband of war to the Sulus.\r\n\r\nIn the estimation of the Sulus, Jamalul A'lam was one of their best\r\nrulers. He carried out many public improvements, built roads and\r\nbridges and mosques, enforced public attendance at the Friday church\r\nservices, and executed the laws with justice and force. He was as\r\nable a ruler as any sultan Sulu had since the days of Abu Bakr,\r\nbut the vicissitudes of fortune were certainty against him. Before\r\nhis reign ended, Spain's hand fell upon him strong and heavy, his\r\ncapital was wrested from him, and his power waned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSULU UNDER SPANISH SOVEREIGNTY\r\n\r\n\r\nOCCUPATION OF JOLO\r\n\r\nThe Sulu sultanate remained practically independent for four hundred\r\nand twenty-five years. Its decline was not caused by national\r\nretrogression or political dissension, but by the hostility\r\nand aggression of its adversary. Sulu's power arose through the\r\nintroduction of firearms into eastern Malaysia and began to decline\r\nat the introduction of steam war vessels into the Philippine\r\nArchipelago. The mobility and speed of steam war vessels put to\r\ndisadvantage all Moro sailing and rowing craft. Pirates were chased on\r\nthe sea and hunted in their lairs. The fear which steamboats struck in\r\nthe hearts of Moros made them run away from their homes and settlements\r\nand hide in the jungles whenever they heard the whistle of a steamboat,\r\nor saw it approaching from a distance. The steamboats purchased by\r\nGovernor Claveria in 1848, which crushed the power of the Balangingi\r\nSamals, were referred to by Captain Keppel in the following words:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"On the 14th of January [1849] we left Zamboanga, getting under\r\n    weigh in company with such a fleet of gunboats as would have done\r\n    credit to any nation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vessels purchased in 1861 increased the efficiency of the navy to\r\nsuch a degree as to make it possible to carry war into Sulu territory,\r\nattack many remote islands and settlements and blockade the port\r\nof Jolo so effectively as to check the importation of firearms and\r\nammunition, and restore a condition of safety and peace on the sea.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1876 was a very significant event in the history\r\nof Sulu. It decided the fate of this state and definitely fixed\r\nits relation to the Philippine Archipelago. Spain's determination\r\nto conquer Sulu never waned and seemed stronger then than ever\r\nbefore. The Governor-General was a man of great ability and aspired\r\nto the highest military honors. Moro raids recurred occasionally and\r\nthe strained relations of the two states became so tense that rupture\r\nwas inevitable.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the history of Spanish campaigns in Sulu up to this\r\ntime, one is strongly impressed with the futility of conquest without\r\noccupation. To invade a Moro settlement, defeat its forces, burn its\r\nhouses, kill some of its inhabitants, and carry some away as prisoners,\r\nis not very different in character and effect from a Moro raid. Such\r\nmethods incited the Moros to revenge themselves by waging war on their\r\ninvaders. This they did by raiding, which is their established method\r\nof warfare. Up to this time natural advantages remained on the side of\r\nthe Sulus and Spanish forces could accomplish no permanent results,\r\nin spite of their superior methods of warfare and excellent military\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nSince the days of the great Corcuera, no Spanish general appears\r\nto have recognized the importance of the occupation of Sulu as an\r\nessential factor in its pacification. Their apparent inability to\r\ncomprehend the real solution of this question might have arisen from\r\nconsciousness of their inability to provide an adequate force for the\r\npurpose. However that may have been, the honor of such an achievement\r\nremained for Governor-General Malcampo, who carried it out with credit\r\nto himself and to the government which he represented. With a clear\r\nunderstanding of the task to be accomplished, he resolved to conquer\r\nSulu and occupy it, and then suppress piracy by striking the pirates at\r\nhome. He left Manila on the 5th of February, 1876, with a large force\r\ncomposed of one battalion of the peninsular regiment of artillery, one\r\ncompany of mountain artillery, five regiments of infantry, ordnance,\r\nengineers, sanitary and prison detachments, and two companies of the\r\nGuardia Civil. [217] At Zamboanga, the expedition was reinforced by\r\n864 volunteers, 400 of whom were from Zamboanga and 464 from Kagayan\r\nde Misamis commanded by the Augustinian friar, Ramon Zueco.\r\n\r\nThe whole expedition, estimated at 9,000 troops, left Zamboanga on\r\nthe 20th of February. They were conveyed in 10 steamboats and 11\r\ntransports, and were escorted by a fleet of 12 gunboats under the\r\nadmiral in command of the Philippine naval forces. The Island of\r\nSulu was reached on the 21st, and next morning a force disembarked\r\nat Patikul, 4 miles east of Jolo. The Moros at this place offered\r\nsome resistance and caused some casualties, but later in the\r\nday abandoned the place and fled. Here a considerable column was\r\ndetached to reconnoitre the interior and advance on Jolo from the land\r\nside. This plan proved impracticable and the column suffered severely\r\nfrom heat and thirst and returned next day to the beach at Tandu, 2\r\nmiles east of Jolo. On the 29th, a general advance was made on Jolo\r\nby land and sea. The fleet opened fire on the town, while the land\r\nforces rushed the forts and trenches on the sides. The main force\r\nwas directed against the fort of Daniel, which was captured after a\r\nsharp fight. The Moros in the other forts made a fiercer resistance,\r\nbut were soon overcome by the fire of the Spanish artillery and the\r\nwhole town was taken by assault. On the 30th, the fort of Panglima\r\nAdak, situated at the base of the hills, was taken. Not content\r\nwith this brilliant victory and intent upon striking a decisive and\r\ndeadly blow, Malcampo directed various expeditions against the other\r\nstrongholds of Sulu. A force of marines and volunteers destroyed 80\r\nboats and burned 90 houses on Tapul. On March 16 an expedition to\r\nLapak destroyed its forts and reduced the settlement to ashes. On\r\nMarch 22 the forts of Parang were reduced, the settlement was burned,\r\nand many Sulus killed. On the 24th Maymbung was similarly destroyed.\r\n\r\nA large garrison was established at Jolo, consisting of two regiments\r\nof infantry, one company of artillery, one company of engineers,\r\nand two companies of disciplinarios. [218] Capt. Pascual Cervera, a\r\ncaptain of frigate of the navy was given command of the garrison, under\r\nthe title of politico-military governor of Sulu. General Malcampo was\r\ngiven the title of \"Count of Jolo,\" while many decorations were awarded\r\nto gallant officers, and a medal was struck for each participant in\r\nthe campaign.\r\n\r\nThe step thus taken by the Philippine Government appears to have\r\nbeen well planned and firmly resolved. No sooner was a footing\r\ngained than measures were undertaken to quarter the troops and\r\nfortify the place. Barracks were constructed on favorable spots on\r\nthe edge of the swamps, and the forts Alfonso XII and the Princess\r\nof Asturias were erected on the site of Daniel's and Panglima Adak's\r\nkuta, respectively. Plans were further laid out at this early time\r\nfor the building of a town and the founding of a colony. Governor\r\nCervera, to whom this task was first entrusted, was a vigorous,\r\nprudent, and circumspect chief. He prosecuted the work with energy\r\nand kept a vigilant watch on the movements of the enemy. He began\r\nthe construction of a military hospital and established the office\r\nof captain of the port. Small expeditions were made to Bwan, Mapaid,\r\nBalimbing, and South Ubian for the chastisement of pirates who took\r\nrefuge there. The kuta of the first three of these settlements were\r\ndestroyed and their armaments were taken. This year saw considerable\r\nsickness in the garrison of Jolo; a large number of patients were\r\nremoved to Zamboanga and 318 to Cebu.\r\n\r\nOn October 1, Governor Cervera was temporarily relieved as governor\r\nof Sulu by Col. Eduardo Fernandez Bremon, and on December 31, 1876,\r\nBrig. Gen. José Paulin assumed permanent command of the garrison\r\nas the second governor of Sulu. The latter continued the peace\r\nnegotiations which were commenced by Governor Cervera and expended\r\na good deal of energy in trying to conciliate some datus and their\r\nfollowers. His measures were, however, resented by the Sulus and\r\nhostilities increased. He left Jolo April 30, 1877, and the command\r\nwas temporarily held by Lieut. Lopez Nuño and José Marina, for three\r\nmonths and one month and a half, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE OF SULTAN JAMALUL A'LAM\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Jolo and its destruction by General Malcampo,\r\nSultan Jamalul A'lam removed to Bud Datu and later to Likup. The datus\r\ndispersed in all directions, but Datus Asibi and Pula, the strongest\r\nchiefs after the sultan, remained in the neighborhood of Jolo, at\r\nTandu and Patikul. The Sulus were united at that time and formed one\r\nparty, which was faithful and loyal to the sultan. They regarded the\r\nestablishment of a Spanish garrison at Jolo as an intrusion upon their\r\nsoil and an intolerable humiliation and offense. The common people\r\nresented the invasion as bitterly as the datus. A few years before\r\nthey regarded themselves the lords of the southern seas. The Bisayan\r\nand the Kalamian Islands, Paláwan, and eastern Borneo were their\r\nhunting grounds. They sailed proudly on the seas and had the dignity of\r\nmasters of innumerable vassals and slaves. But now like fierce tigers\r\ndriven back to their dens or packs of hungry wolves chased to their\r\nhaunts, they waited for no word of command or organized resistance,\r\nbut hurled themselves recklessly at the Spanish soldiers wherever\r\nthey encountered them. Individuals and small parties lost no chance of\r\nfiring a rifle from behind the bushes or throwing a lance from across\r\nthe ditches. Venders in the market who saw a chance to strike a blow at\r\nthe soldiers, could not resist the temptation, but recklessly darted\r\nat the enemy with a kris or barong [219] brandished in hand. A vender\r\nfrom Lu'uk who did not have a barong of his own snatched one from a\r\nneighbor and rushed at the guard. The soldiers were attacked in the\r\nforest while cutting lumber or firewood, at the river while getting\r\ndrinking water and at the beach while bathing. Juramentados [220]\r\ncrept on the sentinels in the dark and from ditches and the beach\r\nand inflicted considerable loss and damage. Some desperate characters\r\nentered the trenches and fought the soldiers on guard, while others\r\nslipped into the barracks and caught soldiers and officers off their\r\nguard and threw torches on the roofs of the warehouses.\r\n\r\nJamalul A'lam discouraged all overtures for peace, and for more\r\nthan two years could not be reconciled to the new conditions and\r\npolitical status. Early in 1877 he encouraged hostilities of all\r\nsorts. Juramentados and small attacking parties harassed the garrison\r\nfrequently. On the 25th of February a force of more than 2,000 Sulus\r\nadvanced against the garrison, but were easily repulsed. Small\r\nparties surprised pickets and attacked laborers. On the 9th of\r\nSeptember about 800 Sulus charged the town from the land side and\r\nfrom the sea and 300 attacked Fort Asturias. They were repulsed in\r\nthe afternoon, but resumed the attack at night and retreated with\r\ngreat loss. Another general fight occurred on the 11th, but the Moros\r\nwere again overpowered and driven back. Undaunted by these failures,\r\nthe Sultan called a council of the datus and planned for another\r\nattack in the future. The juramentados became more treacherous and\r\nintrepid. They hid their barongs inside their trousers and in bundles\r\nthey pretended to be taking to the market and attacked the guard\r\nunawares and after admission into the plaza. This state of affairs\r\ncontinued until June, 1878.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCESSION OF POSSESSIONS IN BORNEO TO BRITISH NORTH BORNEO COMPANY\r\n\r\nIn January, 1878, Sultan Jamalul A`lam ceded the Sulu possessions\r\nin Borneo to the Sabah or British North Borneo Company. He granted\r\nthe authorized representative of this company, Baron von Overbeck,\r\nabsolute ownership and dominion over that large territory for a\r\nmoney consideration of $5,000, Mexican currency, per annum. The\r\nSabah Company was preceded in 1865 by an American company started\r\nby Mr. Torrey on the Kimanis River. The concessions of the American\r\ncompany were obtained from the Sultan of Bruney; but this enterprise\r\nproved a financial failure and its rights were bought by the Austrian\r\nBaron von Overbeck and the English merchant Mr. Alfred Dent.\r\n\r\n\"In spite of the opposition of Spain, which claimed that the Sultan of\r\nSulu being a Spanish vassal could not dispose of his territory without\r\nher consent, the English company organized by Mr. Dent succeeded in\r\nobtaining a charter of incorporation under Act of Parliament, 1st\r\nNovember, 1881, as the 'British North Borneo Company' with right to\r\nacquire other interests in, over, or affecting the territories or\r\nproperty comprised in the several grants.\" Baron von Overbeck and\r\nMr. Dent obtained from the Sultans of Bruney and Sulu a series of\r\ncharters conferring on them sovereign authority in North Borneo under\r\nthe titles of Maharaja of Sabah, Raja of Gaya, Raja of Sandakan, and\r\nDatu Bandahara. The territory governed by the British North Borneo\r\nCompany has a coast line of over 600 miles and an area of more than\r\n30,000 square miles. The form and text of the commission granted by\r\nSultan Jamalul A`lam appointing Baron von Overbeck Datu Bandahara and\r\nRaja of Sandakan is herein quoted as given in the annual report of\r\nGen. George W. Davis, commanding the Department of Mindanao, under\r\ndate of August 1, 1902:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"To all nations on the face of the earth whom these matters may\r\n    concern: We, Mahasari Padukka Mawlana as-Sultan Mohammed Jamalul\r\n    A`lam bin al-Marhum Mahasari Padukka as-Sultan Mohammed Pulalun,\r\n    Sultan of Sulu and its dependencies, send greeting:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, we have seen fit to grant unto our trusty and well-beloved\r\nfriends, Gustavus Baron von Overbeck and Alfred Dent, esquire,\r\ncertain portions of the dominions owned by us, comprising all the\r\nlands on the north and east coast of the Island of Borneo, from the\r\nPandasan River on the northwest to the Sibuco River on the east coast,\r\nincluding amongst others the states of Paitan, Sugut, Bangaya, Labuk,\r\nSandakan, Kina Batangan, and Mumiang and all the lands and territories\r\nin Darvel Bay as far as the Sibuco River, together with all the lands\r\nbelonging thereto, for certain considerations between us agreed, and,\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, the said Baron von Overbeck is the chief and only authorized\r\nrepresentative of his company in Borneo:\r\n\r\n\"Now, therefore, know ye that we, Mahasari Padukka Mawlana as-Sultan\r\nMohammed Jamalul A`lam bin al-Marhum Mahasari Padukka as-Sultan\r\nPulalun, Sultan of Sulu and its dependencies, have nominated and\r\nappointed and do hereby nominate and appoint the said Baron von\r\nOverbeck supreme and independent ruler of the above-named territories,\r\nwith the title of Datu Bandahara and Raja of Sandakan, with absolute\r\npower over life and death of the inhabitants of the country, with all\r\nthe absolute rights of property over the soil of the country vested\r\nin us and the right to dispose of the same as well as the rights\r\nover the productions of the country, whether mineral, vegetable,\r\nor animal, with the rights of making laws, coining money, creating\r\nan army and navy, levying customs dues on home and foreign trade,\r\nand shipping and other dues and taxes on the inhabitants as to him\r\nmay seem good or expedient, together with all other powers and rights\r\nusually exercised by and belonging to sovereign rulers, and which we\r\nhereby delegate to him of our own free and sovereign will.\r\n\r\n\"And we call upon all foreign nations with whom we have formed friendly\r\ntreaties or alliances, and we command all the datus, nobles, governors,\r\nchiefs, and people owing allegiance to us in the said territories\r\nto receive and acknowledge the said Datu Bandahara as the supreme\r\nruler over the said states and to obey his commands and respect his\r\nauthority therein as our own.

H. 1295, being the 22nd day of January,\r\nA. D. 1878.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATY OF JULY, 1878\r\n\r\nCol. Carlos Martinez became Governor of Sulu on the 28th of September,\r\n1877. This distinguished commander applied himself to his work with\r\nunusual enthusiasm and assiduity, and by tact and sagacity succeeded in\r\nrestoring order and peace, in the form of a treaty signed by him and\r\nby Sultan Jamalul A`lam in July, 1878. Great credit for the success\r\nof the negotiations belongs to Datu Harun ar-Rashid, who spared no\r\neffort to convince the Sultan that peace and loyalty to Spain were\r\npreferable to a condition of continued hostility, which meant ruin\r\nto the state of Sulu. The treaty laid stress on the submission of\r\nSulu to Spanish sovereignty, and the terms of the Sulu text expressed\r\nthe same fairly well and without evasion. This being the last treaty\r\nentered into by both states, it may be considered to define the final\r\nrelation that existed between them and the exact position which Sulu\r\noccupied in the Philippine Archipelago during the last period of the\r\nSpanish régime. The best account of this relation is given in the\r\nwords of the treaty itself, careful translations of which have been\r\nprepared from both the Spanish and Sulu texts and are herein added\r\nfor full information:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATION OF THE SPANISH COPY OF THE TREATY\r\n\r\n    Decree\r\n\r\n    Office of the Governor-General of the Philippines,\r\n\r\n    Manila, August 19, 1878.\r\n\r\n    The Supreme Government having approved the bases of pacification\r\n    and capitulation which are submitted through me to his Majesty,\r\n    the King, by the Sultan of Sulu and the Datus of Sulu, and the act\r\n    to that effect, which I confirmed and ratified on the 15th instant,\r\n    having been drafted and signed by the commission appointed for that\r\n    purpose by me in representation of my authority, and the Sultan and\r\n    Datus, in representation of the sultanate of Sulu, I hereby direct\r\n    that a copy of said act be published in the Official Gazette of\r\n    Manila, in order that said bases be officially and publicly known.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Moriones.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Copy referred to.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    An Act drafted on the bases of pacification and capitulation\r\n    presented by the Sultan of Sulu and the Datus to His Majesty the\r\n    King Alfonso XII, through His Excellency the Governor-General of\r\n    the Philippine Islands, acknowledging the sovereignty of Spain\r\n    over the territory of this sultanate.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the town of Likup, Sulu, and in the palace of His Excellency the\r\nSultan of this Archipelago, on the 20th of July 1878, 23rd day of\r\nthe month Rajab, year of the Hegira 1295:\r\n\r\nPresent: Carlos Martinez y Romero, Colonel of Infantry and\r\nPolitico-Military Governor of Jolo, Francisco Fernandez de Alarcon y\r\nGarcía, Colonel of Marine Corps, Frigate Captain and Commander of the\r\nNaval Station of Jolo, and interpreters, Alejo Alvarez y Villasis and\r\nPedro Ortuoste y García, these constituting a commission representing\r\nHis Excellency, the Governor-General of the Philippines:\r\n\r\nAlso present: Padukka Mahasari Mawlana, Sultan Mohammed Jamalul A`lam\r\nand the Datus Padukka Raja Muda, Mohammed Badarud Din, the Padukka\r\nMohammed Zaynul `Abidin Raja Lawut, the Padukka Datu Mohammed Harun\r\nar-Rashid and the Datu Padukka Muluk Bandarasa, in the name and\r\nrepresentation of the Sultanate of Sulu;\r\n\r\nThe object of the meeting was to read and sign the articles of\r\npacification and capitulation presented by the Sultan and Datus to\r\nthe Governor-General on February 24th, of this year, and approved by\r\nHis Majesty Alfonso XII, on May 3rd last; the reading of the articles\r\nbeing proceeded with as follows: Bases of pacification and capitulation\r\npresented by the Sultan and Datus of Sulu, to his Majesty the King of\r\nSpain Don Alfonso XII, through His Excellency the Governor-General of\r\nthe Philippines, acknowledging the sovereignty of the King of Spain\r\nover the territory of the said sultanate.\r\n\r\nArticle 1.

The Sultan shall be allowed to communicate directly with\r\nthe Governor-General whenever he has a complaint to make against the\r\nGovernor, or the commander of war ships.\r\n\r\nArticle 6. The Sultan shall be authorized to issue licenses to carry\r\nmuzzle-loading firearms when requested by Sulus, after presenting\r\ntwo honorably known witnesses who will guarantee their proper use\r\nboth on land and sea.\r\n\r\nArticle 7. The Sultan shall be allowed to issue passports to Sulu\r\ncraft; but when any of said craft has to leave the Sulu Archipelago,\r\nthe owners will first have to go before the Governor; the principal\r\ndatus and some other persons serving under commissions from the Sultan\r\nare to be excepted from this formality; but the Sultan shall report\r\nall such cases to the Governor.\r\n\r\nArticle 8.

H.\r\n\r\n    There met the Politico-Military Governor of Sulu, Señor Don Carlos\r\n    Martinez y Romero, Colonel of Infantry; and the Commander of the\r\n    Naval Station of Sulu, Colonel of Marine Infantry and Frigate\r\n    Captain, Señor Don Francisco Fernandez de Alarcon y García and\r\n    Señor Captain Alejo Alvarez, and Señor Don Pedro Ortuoste y García,\r\n    the representatives of His Excellency the Governor-General of\r\n    the Philippines.\r\n\r\n    Also present: Padukka Mahasari Mawlana Sultan Mohammed Jamalul\r\n    A`lam of Sulu, and Padukka Datu Mohammed Badarud Din, and Padukka\r\n    Datu Raja Lawut Mohammed Zaynul `Abidin, and Padukka Datu Muluk\r\n    Bandarasa Mohammed Pula, and Padukka Datu Mohammed Harun ar-Rashid\r\n    who are properly obeyed by all their subjects.\r\n\r\n    The object of the meeting was to read, confirm, and sign\r\n    the agreement presented by Padukka Mahasari Mawlana Sultan\r\n    Mohammed Jamalul A`lam and all the datus, to His Excellency the\r\n    Governor-General, on the 22nd day of Safar, 1295 A. H., or the\r\n    24th of February, 1878 A. D., which was approved by His Majesty\r\n    the King of Spain, Alfonso XII, on the 3rd day of May, of this\r\n    year, or the 2nd of Jamadil-Awal.\r\n\r\n    The following is the copy of the statements that were read:\r\n\r\n    This is the treaty of Spain with the Sultan and Datus of Sulu\r\n    which was sent to His Majesty the King of Spain, Don Alfonso XII,\r\n    through His Excellency the Governor-General of the Philippines.\r\n\r\n    Article I. All the people of Sulu and its Archipelago shall obey\r\n    only the King of Spain, Alfonso XII, or whosoever shall succeed\r\n    him. This being our wish, we will not change or turn away to any\r\n    other nation.\r\n\r\n    Article II. The Spanish Government shall pay the Sultan an annual\r\n    salary of 2,400 pesos, Mexican currency, and Padukka Datu Raja\r\n    Muda Mohammed Badarud Din 700 pesos. It shall also pay 600 pesos\r\n    to each of the three following datus, namely: Padukka Datu Raja\r\n    Lawut Mohammed Zaynul `Abidin, Padukka Datu Muluk Bandarasa\r\n    Mohammed Pula, and Padukka Datu Mohammed Harun ar-Rashid; this\r\n    is to compensate them for the losses they suffered.\r\n\r\n    Article III. The Spanish Government may occupy any place it chooses\r\n    along the northern coast of the island, from Sinungan to Bwal and\r\n    as far as Kadungdung, but the southern coast of the island from\r\n    Kadungdung to Sinungan shall be left for the Sultan; on condition,\r\n    however, that it may be occupied by the Spanish Government in\r\n    case of trouble with foreigners, at any future time. In case\r\n    the plantations or fields of the people are appropriated for\r\n    such occupation, they shall be compensated for. Houses, however,\r\n    shall not be removed.\r\n\r\n    Article IV. The Sultan shall have the right to collect duties\r\n    from all foreign merchants and ships of whatever nationality they\r\n    may be, in case they come to our ports; but we have no right to\r\n    collect duties from them when they come to ports occupied by the\r\n    Spanish Government.\r\n\r\n    Article V. In case of disagreement between us and the governor\r\n    of Sulu, or the commanders of war ships, the Sultan shall have\r\n    the right to communicate with the Captain-General direct.\r\n\r\n    Article VI. All the people of Sulu can, if they choose, use\r\n    muzzle-loading rifles and lantaka. [221] They will, however, be\r\n    required to present a certificate from two or three free people, of\r\n    good reputation, to the effect that they (who use the firearms) are\r\n    good and well-behaving people and that they do not use such arms\r\n    for mischief. Under such conditions the Sultan may give a license.\r\n\r\n    Article VII. The Sultan has the right to give passports to Sulus\r\n    wishing to travel for commercial purposes to whatever place they\r\n    may go, on condition that they pass by Jolo to inform the Spanish\r\n    governor of their destination. In case those of noble birth or\r\n    the datus do not stop at Jolo, the Sultan himself shall inform the\r\n    Governor, for they, as a rule, have the former's consent to travel.\r\n\r\n    Article VIII. We will try to suppress all pirates; but in case\r\n    we are unable to do so we will notify the Governor of their\r\n    location. But in case we do not know where they are, we can not\r\n    be held responsible for such information. We will also aid the\r\n    Government with as many men as we can afford to bring together,\r\n    and we shall be pleased to give guides who can tell the hiding\r\n    places of such pirates.\r\n\r\n    Article IX. Our customs and usages, including our religion, shall\r\n    not be changed. If there is any priest who desires to travel around\r\n    in this country, he ought to inform the Sultan, so that he may send\r\n    a companion with him; but in case he fails to ask permission and\r\n    travels around without obeying this rule and is killed, the Sultan\r\n    can not be held responsible for such results. The same condition\r\n    shall govern in the case of all Spaniards and soldiers or any\r\n    one else who may desire to live outside of the places agreed upon.\r\n\r\n    Article X. We guarantee to deliver all Christians who run away on\r\n    account of crime; so also must the Spaniards treat us Mohammedans\r\n    in case our servants and people run away to them. It would not\r\n    be right for the Spaniards to hold or protect them.\r\n\r\n    Article XI. The Sulus and all the Sultan's subjects have the right\r\n    to trade in small or large boats whether they use flags or not;\r\n    this on condition that they have passes; but in case they like to\r\n    use a flag they must use the Spanish flag. The Sultan shall not\r\n    use a flag of his own, but that of the King of Spain. All other\r\n    datus and chiefs of the islands, whenever they use any flag,\r\n    must use the Spanish commercial flag.\r\n\r\n    Article XII. The Spaniards and the Sultan shall fully observe\r\n    the articles of this agreement which has to be ratified by the\r\n    Spanish Government. We sincerely beg that, whenever there is any\r\n    disagreement between us and the Spanish Governor concerning some\r\n    crime, careful and proper investigation be made, without any\r\n    undue haste to fight. We have full trust and confidence in the\r\n    Spanish Government and expect that the Spanish Government will\r\n    have similar trust in us.\r\n\r\n    Article XIII. It shall not be right to alter the articles of this\r\n    agreement without the mutual consent of both parties.\r\n\r\n    Both parties having understood all the articles of this treaty\r\n    do hereby confirm it all and certify to it. Said articles being\r\n    identical with those which were presented by Padukka Mahasari\r\n    Mawlana Sultan Mohammed Jamalul A'lam, signed by us in the palace\r\n    in Likup, on the day mentioned above in this document.\r\n\r\n    I, Don Domingo Moriones y Murillo, Lieutenant-General of the\r\n    National Army, Marquis de Oroquieta, Knight Grand Cross of the\r\n    Royal and Military Order of San Hermenegildo, of the Royal and\r\n    Distinguished Order of Carlos III, of that of Military Merit,\r\n    Red and White, and many others for feats of arms, Governor and\r\n    Captain-General of the Philippine Islands, etc., etc., in the name\r\n    of His Majesty the King of Spain, Alfonso XII, whom God keep, do\r\n    confirm and ratify the above act of pacification and capitulation,\r\n    in all its parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Manila, August 15, 1878 A. D.\r\n\r\n    (18, Sha'ban, 1295 A. H.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe status of Sulu as defined by this treaty resembled that of a\r\nprotectorate rather than a dependency. The internal administration\r\nof Sulu, its customs, laws, and religion were fully respected and\r\nwere not subject to Spanish jurisdiction, confirmation, approval, or\r\ninterference of any sort, except in matters pertaining to regulations\r\nfor the use of firearms.\r\n\r\nThe foreign political relations of Sulu were made subject to the\r\nfull control of the Philippine Government. This control (or sovereign\r\nright) was the chief motive for the war and was declared by the treaty\r\nindisputable. On the strength of this both England and Germany, in\r\n1885, concluded a treaty with Spain recognizing her full sovereignty\r\nover the whole Sulu Archipelago, including Balabak and Kagayan\r\nSulu. In that same treaty Spain relinquished all claims to that\r\npart of northeastern Borneo formerly ruled by the Sultans of Sulu;\r\nthis being the territory administered by the British North Borneo\r\nCompany. The commercial relations of Sulu with foreign countries\r\nwere not submitted to Spanish supervision or control outside of the\r\nterritory occupied by the garrisons, and the sultan was empowered to\r\ncollect duties from foreign merchants and ships trading with Maymbung,\r\nSiasi, and other places not occupied by the Philippine Government.\r\n\r\nThe treaty on the whole secured for Spain the fruits of her conquest\r\nand established a stable condition of peace and safety throughout\r\nthe whole Archipelago and in the neighboring southern seas. Foreign\r\ninterference ceased, commerce revived, and trading routes were resumed\r\nwithout danger or risk.\r\n\r\nGovernor Martinez had a brilliant term of service marked by important\r\nresults and excellent public improvements. He began the titanic\r\nlabor of filling the swamps and brought the town of Jolo to its\r\npresent level. He laid out its streets, plazas, parks, and trees,\r\nfinished the tower of the Queen (blockhouse No. 2), and constructed\r\nthe blockhouse of the playa at Tulay, the military hospital, the\r\nlight-house and various bridges. A great part of this work was done\r\nby prison labor, 400 prisoners having been transferred from Manila\r\nto Jolo for this purpose. His administration marked the beginning\r\nof a period of prosperity to the colony and temporary peace with the\r\nSulus. He reëstablished friendly relations with the sultan and datus\r\nand had success in many undertakings. Early in 1880 he fell sick and\r\nto the regret of all parties left Jolo for Manila.\r\n\r\nGovernor Martinez was relieved by Col. Rafael Gonzalez de Rivera, the\r\nfourth governor of Sulu, on February 3, 1880. Rivera followed in the\r\nsteps of Martinez, but circumstances changed as the sultan's health\r\ndeclined, and the sultana's political intrigues divided the state into\r\ntwo hostile parties. On March 30 the scouts at the tower of the Queen\r\nwere attacked by a band of Sulus, who killed 2 privates, and wounded 1\r\nsergeant and 6 privates. However, the Sulus were repulsed, losing 12\r\nmen dead. The sultan, when called upon to punish the transgressors,\r\nresponded promptly, went to Lu'uk and chastised them severely. In\r\nDecember of the same year Datu Pula reported some juramentados in the\r\nsuburbs, two of whom were encountered by the troops; one was killed\r\nand the other fled.\r\n\r\nAfter the treaty of 1878, Jamalul A'lam established his official\r\nresidence at Maymbung and acted in a dignified and creditable\r\nmanner. He observed the terms of the treaty faithfully until his\r\ndeath. He was intelligent, vigorous, and willing to learn. He received\r\nSpanish and native visitors with befitting courtesy and was well\r\nrespected and endeared himself to everybody who knew him. Following\r\nthe example of his father, he published a code of laws which is said\r\nto have been milder than that of his predecessors. It is no doubt\r\na modification or a reproduction of the code used by Pulalun and\r\nJamalul Kiram I. It was in current use in the country at the time of\r\nthe Spanish evacuation in 1899.\r\n\r\nJamalul A'lam lived an honorable life and kept one wife only for the\r\ngreater part of the time. He repudiated the mother of his eldest son,\r\nBadarud Din, and loved tenderly Pangian Inchi Jamila, the mother\r\nof his second, Amirul Kiram. Inchi Jamila was not very beautiful,\r\nbut she was attractive, intelligent, active, and comparatively\r\nyoung. She associated with her husband in the administration of\r\naffairs and wielded considerable influence on the chiefs and council of\r\nstate. She was very generous and entertaining, and won the respect of\r\nthe majority of the datus. Wishing to secure the sultanate for her son,\r\nAmirul Kiram, she attempted to alienate Badarud Din from his father\r\nand used her influence on the council to that end. Intrigues followed\r\nand the state divided into two factions, partisans of Amirul Kiram\r\nand Pangian Inchi Jamila and partisans of Badarud Din, the rightful\r\nheir. Jamalul A'lam managed affairs with a strong hand and kept all\r\nparties united, but early in 1881 his health began to decline rapidly\r\nand his favorite wife meddled all the more with the affairs of the\r\nstate. The knowledge of her schemes soon spread, and as it became\r\nknown that Jamalul A'lam was actually failing, disorder arose and a\r\ncondition bordering on anarchy prevailed. On the 22d of February armed\r\nSulus attempted to force the gates of Jolo, but they were repulsed\r\nand most of them were killed. The sultan grew worse and disturbances\r\nincreased. The front of the plaza of Jolo became an arena of war,\r\nseveral attacks were made on the town, and conditions became so bad\r\nthat Rivera requested reënforcements from the Governor-General and\r\npermission to take the field against the hostile parties. The request\r\nwas forwarded through the governor of Mindanao, who indorsed the\r\ncommunication, recommending that he be empowered to decide whether\r\nreënforcements were needed or not, and in case they were needed, to\r\nlead the troops himself. This being granted, the governor of Mindanao\r\ncame to Jolo, reported unfavorably, and returned to Zamboanga.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE OF SULTAN BADARUD DIN II\r\n\r\nJamalul A'lam died April 8, 1881, but before his death he caused word\r\nto be sent to the governor of Sulu informing him that an attack on\r\nJolo was imminent. At 3 a.m. on the 10th, the Sulus issued from the\r\nwoods and made a general attack on the garrison, which resulted in\r\nfailure and in the loss of 103 Sulus, who fell dead in the ditches.\r\n\r\nThe garrison of Jolo amounted, at that time, to 27 officers and 753\r\nmen. All that Colonel Rivera could do was to protect the plaza and keep\r\nhimself well informed about matters in general. On April 14, Panglima\r\nAdak brought letters from Inchi Jamila relating to the succession to\r\nthe sultanate. She announced that the late Sultan directed in his will\r\nthat Amirul Kiram be elected sultan, and she endeavored to influence\r\nthe governor in his favor. Rivera expressed himself in favor of Badarud\r\nDin, declaring this to be the only course he could take in conformity\r\nwith the terms and intentions of the treaty. This put a quietus on\r\nthe cause of dissension and the council of datus voted unanimously\r\nin favor of Badarud Din II, who had just completed his nineteenth year.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, disturbances in Sulu had caused some\r\nalarm at Manila and prompt action was taken by the General\r\nGovernment. Brigadier-General La Corte, who was intending to inspect\r\nthe fortifications of the south, was directed temporarily to assume\r\ncommand of the government of Mindanao and personally to conduct\r\nwhat operations it might be necessary to undertake on the Island of\r\nSulu. La Corte came by the way of Cebu and Zamboanga and brought the\r\nSixth Regiment of Infantry from Cebu and two companies of the Second\r\nRegiment of Infantry from Zamboanga. Soon after his arrival at Jolo,\r\nhe addressed a strong letter to Sultan Badarud Din requesting the\r\npunishment of the Sulus who attacked the Plaza of Jolo on April\r\n10. Badarud Din responded promptly and commissioned Datu Pula to go\r\nto Lu'uk and Taglibi and punish the transgressors. This, however,\r\nwas not carried out, for Panglima Sakandar of Lu'uk, who was loyal to\r\nthe Sultan, placed himself at the service of Badarud Din and promised\r\nto bring the aggressors alive or dead. The Sultan's forces attacked\r\nthe rancheria of Maharaja Abdulla, the chief aggressor, and killed\r\nnine men and one datu. The maharaja and the chiefs of seven other\r\nrancherias of Lu'uk then surrendered themselves and swore allegiance\r\nto Spain. The sultan and the chief datus later presented themselves\r\nbefore General La Corte and reaffirmed their fealty to the Spanish\r\nGovernment. The Governor-General subsequently wrote a letter to the\r\nSultan, expressing his pleasure and recognizing the sincere efforts\r\nof the latter to reëstablish peace and tranquillity.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1881, General La Corte authorized the construction of the\r\nloopholed wall with towers and embrasures to complete the defenses\r\nof the town. He recommended frequent reconnaissances of the interior\r\nand target practice for the forces of the garrison, and advised the\r\ngovernor to strengthen the hand of the Sultan and to require from him\r\nat the same time strict enforcement of all obligations that tended to\r\nprove the loyalty of his people to the Spanish Government. General\r\nLa Corte left Jolo on the 29th of June, taking back the troops of\r\nthe Second Regiment of Infantry to Zamboanga.\r\n\r\nGovernor Rivera was relieved on November 15, 1881, by Col. Isidro\r\nGutierrez Soto. The new governor exhibited unusual coolness and\r\npersonal courage. He visited Maymbung without military escort and\r\nattempted in every way to strengthen his friendship with the Sultan and\r\ndatus and to encourage them to have similar confidence in the Spanish\r\nofficials; but dissensions among the Sulus and the jealousy of Pangian\r\nInchi Jamila frustrated all his efforts. Without opposition Badarud\r\nDin might have ruled fairly well, but the plotting of Inchi Jamila\r\nand the unfriendliness of her party made a coward of him. He became\r\ninconsistent and seemed at times to lack confidence in the Spanish\r\nGovernment. He projected a secret trip to Sandakan and the Spaniards\r\nnotified him that in case he left Sulu without the permission of the\r\nGovernment another sultan would be appointed in his place.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1882, Bangao was occupied by troops, and part of the\r\nsouthern squadron was stationed there. In May Siasi was similarly\r\ngarrisoned. On April 29, 1882, Governor Soto became ill and left\r\nfor Manila. He was relieved temporarily by Brig.-Gen. José Paulin,\r\nwho was on a tour of inspection in the south and had come to Jolo to\r\nconduct some official negotiations with the sultan.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of June, Col. Eduardo Fernandez Bremon took office as\r\ngovernor of Sulu. Soon after this time Sultan Badarud Din left\r\nJolo on a pilgrimage to Mecca and delegated his authority to Datu\r\nAliyud Din in conjunction with the Sultana Inchi Jamila. Governor\r\nBremon's command was very eventful and difficult. Cholera came from\r\nSingapore and overran the whole Archipelago. Disturbances increased,\r\nthe turbulent inhabitants of Lu'uk became restless and hostile,\r\nand juramentados came so frequently that they actually besieged the\r\ntown. The wall and towers and the defensive Barracks of Victory were\r\nfinished and these completely checked the entrance of hostile Sulus\r\ninto the town. Ladrones and wandering parties infested the suburbs and\r\nhills and communication with Maymbung was broken. In August Governor\r\nBremon fell ill and asked to be relieved of his command. In September\r\na general attack on the plaza of Jolo was planned by the Sulus and\r\nconditions assumed a very serious aspect. For one whole month, it is\r\nsaid, the gates of Jolo were not opened.\r\n\r\nThe charge of Sulu affairs at this critical stage was intrusted to\r\nGeneral Paulin, who arrived at Jolo on October 1, accompanied by\r\nCol. Julian Gonzalez Parrado, who was appointed to relieve Colonel\r\nBremon as governor of Sulu. The Sulu squadron was increased and the\r\ngarrison of Jolo reënforced. General Paulin conducted an expedition\r\nto Lu'uk to chastise the rancherias of Tu'tu' and Bwal, which were\r\nreported to be the chief centers of hostility and disturbance on the\r\nisland. He first called at Maymbung, and pressed upon Datu Aliyud Din\r\nand the council the necessity of their doing their part toward the\r\npunishment of the guilty parties, and Datu Aliyud Din at the head of\r\na small force accompanied the expedition. Troops were disembarked at\r\nPandang-pandang, Kadungdung, Tampukan, and Bwal; they burned parts\r\nof these rancherias and made some advances inland. The fighting\r\nwas not severe and the Sulus harassed the troops to a considerable\r\nextent. The navy coöperated with the troops, but the expedition was\r\nsmall and accomplished no significant results.\r\n\r\nIn his report to the Governor-General, General Paulin recommended the\r\nrepetition of such expeditions in order to impress the Sulus with the\r\nsuperiority of Spanish arms and to punish all transgressors. Commenting\r\nupon the nature of the warfare the expedition experienced he considered\r\nthe natural difficulties attending campaigns in the island as being\r\ndifficult to overcome. The art of war, he said, has no application as\r\nagainst Moros. The Sulus, he continued, are either treacherous wild\r\nbeasts or fanatical heroes, according to the sentiment which at the\r\ntime impels them to fight. They are savage warriors who hide in order\r\nto attack and rise at the feet of the enemy when least expected. They\r\nconceal themselves in clumps of trees and cliffs or ditches, and when\r\nready to fight, discharge their firearms or throw lances and bolos,\r\nwhile howling and dancing frantic war dances. They flee after an\r\nattack, but in their flight they attack the rear guard.\r\n\r\nGovernor Parrado was a man of considerable ability and tact. Confidence\r\nand peace were reëstablished, the datus often came to town and the\r\npeople attended the market in large numbers. In December, 1882,\r\nTata'an, on the northwestern coast of Tawi-tawi, was occupied by\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nOn his way back from Mecca, Sultan Badarud Din was met at Singapore\r\nby a representative of the Philippine Government, who requested\r\nthat he return to Jolo by the way of Manila. The sultan declined,\r\nstating that the recent death of his son made it imperative for him to\r\nreturn directly to Maymbung, but he promised to visit Manila later. He\r\nreached Sulu in January, 1883. After his arrival he exhibited vigor\r\nand watchfulness and soon prepared to go to Manila. This project\r\nseemed to excite unusual disturbance, bordering on panic at Parang\r\nand Lu'uk, and for fear of undesirable consequences he changed his\r\nmind and gave up the trip.\r\n\r\nBy his pilgrimage to Mecca, which was the first ever taken by a\r\nSultan of Sulu, Badarud Din gained respect and influence, but no\r\nsagacity. Desiring to strengthen his authority and to imitate the\r\nEuropean nations by organizing a police force for the sultanate,\r\nhe brought 2 Egyptian officers and 30 Sikhs from Singapore and made\r\narrangements with an English house in Singapore for the purchase of\r\n200 breech-loading rifles. The rifles caused the Spanish Government\r\nsome anxiety, but thorough investigation and inquiry proved that they\r\nnever went beyond Labuan. The Sikhs were not paid for two months after\r\narrival at Maymbung and left the service at once. Such organization\r\nmeant a first step toward reform, but Badarud Din had no education\r\nworthy of the name and lacked the requisite ability, strength, and\r\ncharacter for carrying on such measures. Soon he acquired the opium\r\nhabit and methods of licentious living. He finally lost his hold on\r\naffairs in general.\r\n\r\nDatu Aliyud Din removed to Matanda, where a large house was built for\r\nhim by the governor of Sulu; and a village of 400 people soon arose\r\naround his residence. The blockhouse of Jovellar was then built near\r\nthe beach for his protection and help.\r\n\r\nSo far the governor of Sulu addressed the sultan as his son, the\r\nsultan addressed the governor as his father and relations were friendly\r\nand pleasant. But in June, 1883, three juramentados slipped into the\r\npost, killed two officers and wounded one officer and two soldiers\r\nbefore they could be dispatched. Governor Parrado addressed a strong\r\nletter to the sultan requesting the immediate and proper punishment\r\nof the district from which the juramentados came. The sultan neither\r\nresponded nor did he send information relative to the place from\r\nwhich the juramentados came. Governor Parrado then took matters into\r\nhis own hand, made an expedition to Taglibi and chastised its chief\r\nSahibud Din. Soon after, two soldiers were killed in the vicinity of\r\nJolo while cutting bamboo and another expedition was undertaken to\r\nBuhanginan to punish the murderers. An expedition was also made to\r\nSouth Ubian, where the pirate Panglima Jami was reported to have taken\r\nrefuge. Jami was not found at this place, but the local chiefs burned\r\nJami's kuta and house and promised to deliver him to the government\r\nwhen he returned to Ubian.\r\n\r\nGovernor Parrado proved himself an efficient and able administrator. He\r\nrecognized the absurdity of a policy of extermination, and felt\r\nconscious of the lack of a uniform, well-planned and settled policy on\r\nthe part of the General Government toward Sulu. He realized that the\r\nMoros possessed a form of civilization and could not be treated like\r\nsavages. He used his influence for good in times of peace and employed\r\nhis forces to reëstablish peace with justice in times of hostility. He\r\nwas strong and sagacious in most of the measures he undertook.\r\n\r\nDatu Pula, a strong chief worthy of trust and a man of prestige,\r\ndied before the expiration of the year 1883. Pula's influence always\r\ntended toward peace with Spain and the support of Badarud Din against\r\nhis rival. His death was consequently a loss to both sides. The sultan\r\nand the governor continued on good terms of friendship during January\r\nand February, 1884, and the affairs of Sulu were conducted smoothly\r\nand peacefully, but on the 22d of February, 1884, Badarud Din died;\r\nthe state was soon rent by dissension and another period of trouble\r\nand disturbance followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRUGGLE FOR THE SULTANATE\r\n\r\nThe question of a successor to Sultan Badarud Din II proved to be very\r\nvexatious, both to the Sulus and to the Spanish Government. At that\r\ndate the eligibles to the sultanate belonged to three houses--that\r\nof Sultan Jamalul Kiram I, the house of Sultan Shakirul Lah, and\r\nthat of Datu Putung, the son of Sultan Alimud Din I. These houses\r\nwere represented by the three candidates, Raja Muda Amirul Kiram,\r\nDatu Aliyud Din, and Datu Harun ar-Rashid.\r\n\r\nAmirul Kiram was the oldest brother of the three sons of Sultan\r\nJamalul A'lam from Pangian Inchi Jamila. He was born on the 27th of\r\nMarch, 1868, and was at one time the rival of Badarud Din II, his\r\nolder brother. The sultanate remained in the line of Jamalul Kiram I\r\nfor four consecutive generations and the majority of Sulus had come\r\nto consider the sons of Jamalul A'lam as the direct heirs to the\r\nthrone. The influence of Pangian Inchi Jamila was a strong factor\r\nin itself and the claims of Raja Muda Amirul Kiram were vigorously\r\npressed upon the council of state.\r\n\r\nDatu Aliyud Din was the son of Datu Israel, the son of Sultan Shakirul\r\nLah. He urged that the descendants of Sultan Shakirul Lah had an\r\nequal right to the sultanate with the descendants of Jamalul Kiram I,\r\nand protested against the injustice of electing a minor in preference\r\nto older and maturer members of the family.\r\n\r\nDatu Harun ar-Rashid had no sultan in his line for five generations and\r\nconsequently did not press his claim to the succession. He was a cousin\r\nof Pangian Inchi Jamila and a close friend of Jamalul A'lam. He was the\r\nonly living signer of the treaty of 1878, but since that date he had\r\nremoved to Palawan, where the Spanish Government intrusted him with the\r\nrule of the Moro population of Palawan, Balabak, and the neighboring\r\nsouthern islands, and where he had rendered very creditable service.\r\n\r\nDatu Aliyud Din and his party were so determined in their opposition\r\nto Pangian Inchi Jamila and Raja Muda Amirul Kiram that they would not\r\nentertain any proposals of compromise or attend the council of state at\r\nMaymbung. The country was agitated and all datus and subordinate chiefs\r\ntook sides with one or the other of the two candidates. The majority\r\nof datus and chiefs were in favor of Amirul Kiram. Datus Pula-pula,\r\nUyung, Marachak, Kalbi, and Julkarnayn, who were as a rule united,\r\nand who wielded the strongest authority on the island next to that of\r\nthe sultan, remained almost neutral, but at heart indorsed the claim\r\nof Aliyud Din. In general the southern and greater half of the island\r\nsupported Amirul Kiram of Maymbung, while the northern half favored\r\nAliyud Din, who had in the meantime moved his residence to Patikul.\r\n\r\nGovernor Parrado offered his good offices and tried to overcome the\r\ndifficulty by suggesting that Amirul Kiram be elected sultan, but that\r\nAliyud Din should act as regent during the minority of the former. He\r\nwent so far as to name a new and general council of state to meet at\r\nMaymbung and decide the question. He submitted this proposition to\r\nboth parties threatening to leave them to their fate in case they\r\ndid not comply with his advice. The Maymbung party accepted the\r\ngovernor's proposition, but the Patikul party did not; consequently\r\nboth candidates were proclaimed sultans, one at Patikul and one\r\nat Maymbung, and both prepared to fight. Ambuscades, skirmishes,\r\nsurprises, robberies, and cattle stealing followed. Governor Parrado\r\nremained neutral until July when he made friendly visits to Maymbung\r\nand Patikul and again counseled concord and compromise. Datu Harun\r\narrived in Sulu on the 17th of November and both parties solicited his\r\nsupport and consulted him; but he failed to effect any agreement. A\r\nlittle later he accompanied the governor of Sulu to Manila where\r\nhe received much attention because of the success that attended\r\nhis services at Palawan. He remained in Manila about one month and\r\nreturned to live at Matanda, filled with a strong desire to better\r\nhimself and his country. A year passed and no agreement could be\r\nreached, nor did the Spanish Government officially recognize any of\r\nthe claimants. Amirul Kiram indulged in licentiousness and Aliyud\r\nDin took to opium.\r\n\r\nGovernor Parrado during his administration completed the Cuartel de\r\nEspaña and the market building and improved the forts Alfonso XII\r\nand the Princess of Asturias. The majority of the nipa houses were\r\nreplaced by better structures of brick with iron roofs. A system of\r\nwaterworks was put in and Jolo was declared an open port. On July 23,\r\n1885, Parrado was succeeded by Col. Francisco Castilla.\r\n\r\nGovernor Castilla followed the policy of his predecessor and remained\r\nneutral. Amirul Kiram had in the meantime massed a large force and\r\nattacked Aliyud Din. The latter's party had weakened and only 800\r\nremained to defend Patikul and its kuta. The Maymbung forces greatly\r\noutnumbered their adversaries, defeated them, destroyed the kuta,\r\nand burned the settlement. Datu Aliyud Din fled to Basilan and lived\r\nfor a while with Sharif Aqil. Raja Muda Amirul Kiram then requested\r\nthe Spanish Government to recognize his succession to the sultanate\r\nand a commission was sent from Manila to investigate the matter and\r\nreport on it. After five months' service as governor of Sulu Colonel\r\nCastilla asked to be relieved at the end of the year and Col. Juan\r\nArolas succeeded him in January, 1886.\r\n\r\nGovernor Arolas devoted himself to his work with unusual enthusiasm\r\nand exemplary energy. Public works and sanitation received his best\r\nattention. Trees were planted, the streets were improved, the gutters\r\nand sewers were repaired and renewed, and the town was kept thoroughly\r\nclean. The death list of the garrison was reduced from 102 in 1885\r\nto 51 in 1886. A good road was constructed outside the wall and a\r\nbeautiful street was extended from the southern gate of the town to\r\nTulay and Asturias on both sides of which coconut and shade trees were\r\nplanted. The streets of Tulay were planned on the same scale as those\r\nof the walled town, and fillings on a large scale were commenced for\r\nthis purpose. Excellent waterworks were completed and iron pipes were\r\nlaid throughout the walled town and Tulay for the use of the garrison\r\nand the public.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the report of the commission appointed to investigate\r\nSulu affairs and the subject of succession to the sultanate, directions\r\nwere received from Madrid and Manila to the effect that Datu Harun\r\nshould be appointed subsultan and Amirul Kiram sultan, and that both\r\nbe requested to go to Manila, take the oath of fidelity to Spain,\r\nand be invested with authority by the Governor-General. Datu Harun\r\nhad made himself very agreeable to Governors Parrado and Castilla and\r\na strong friendship had grown up between them. Arolas soon learned to\r\nlike Harun and trusted him. Amirul Kiram was then 18 years old and his\r\nage probably suggested the necessity of having a regent who would be\r\ncompetent to take charge of affairs and who would be favorable to the\r\npolicy of the Spanish Government. The wish and opinion of the Sulu\r\nnation and the desire of the ambitious sultana to be regent herself\r\nwere not fully respected and could not be approved, and the dictates\r\nof the Spanish Government had to be complied with. Harun, as might\r\nhave been expected, obeyed the royal directions. Amirul Kiram refused\r\nto go to Manila, considered it a humiliation for him to have a regent\r\nand to be compelled to visit Manila for the approval of the Spanish\r\nGovernment. He felt that he was the rightful heir and the choice of\r\nthe Sulus and that the treaty of 1878 well guarded his rights and\r\ngranted the Sulus the full privilege of electing their chiefs. The\r\nSulu character asserted itself in his action and the nation stood by\r\nhim and counseled noncompliance to directions prejudicial to their\r\nown rights and national honor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE OF SULTAN HARUN\r\n\r\nDatu Harun went to Manila alone and Governor Arolas recommended his\r\nappointment as sultan. Governor-General Terrero cabled to Madrid and\r\nobtained authority for this action on September 11, 1886. Harun was\r\nofficially announced in Manila as Sultan of Sulu, and his appointment\r\non the 24th of September was made the occasion of some formality.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sultan Harun placed his hands upon the Quran, his Minister\r\n    Sheikh Mustafa bin Ahmad officiating, and his high Excellency the\r\n    Governor-General administered to him the oath in the following\r\n    form: \"Do ye swear to uphold steadfastly all the stipulations\r\n    covenanted in the capitulations and to give faithful obedience\r\n    to His Majesty, the King?\" To this Sultan Harun answered: \"I\r\n    swear to comply with the terms of the capitulations and with the\r\n    commands of His Majesty, the King.\" And His Excellency replied:\r\n    \"May God and men help ye if ye do this and if ye do not, then\r\n    may God and the Government punish you!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSultan Harun arrived at Jolo in October, and, escorted by 200\r\nSpanish soldiers, one gunboat, and one steam launch, he proceeded\r\nto Parang where he expected the Sulus to declare their allegiance\r\nto him. However, their reception was not as warm as he expected\r\nand he soon found it to his advantage to retire to Jolo. The Sulu\r\nchiefs appealed to arms and prepared to defend the rights of Amirul\r\nKiram at the cost of their lives. Desiring to support his nominee in\r\nthe sultanate Governor Arolas visited Parang in company with Sultan\r\nHarun on the 2d day of November and an additional number of chiefs,\r\nincluding Panglima Damang, swore allegiance to Sultan Harun.\r\n\r\nSuch measures aroused the activity of Amirul Kiram and his party and\r\nseveral places in Parang were attacked by the Maymbung forces and\r\nconsiderable unrest prevailed. Harun's sultanate seemed unacceptable\r\nto the great majority of datus, and hostilities arose in many\r\nlocalities. Murders and juramentado attacks occurred in the vicinity\r\nof Jolo. The kuta of Bwisan and Timahu were attacked and reduced,\r\nthe settlements burned, and much blood was shed. Hostilities extended\r\nto Siasi and the kuta of Datu Hiyang was attacked. In February, 1887,\r\na force of 3,000 Sulus started from Maymbung and attacked Jolo. The\r\ngarrison repulsed the attack, but juramentados and hostile bands\r\nharassed the town. Small expeditions reconnoitered Tapul, Lugus,\r\nand Siasi; but no active measures could be taken against Maymbung\r\nuntil reënforcements could arrive from Zamboanga and Kotabato.\r\n\r\nAt that time General Terrero headed a campaign in the upper Mindanao\r\nValley against Datu Utu and forces were drawn from Zamboanga and Jolo\r\nto coöperate at Kotabato. With the return of the troops in April the\r\nwar vessels which operated on the Mindanao River also came to Jolo and\r\nGovernor Arolas began preparations at once to fight Amirul Kiram who\r\nwas strongly intrenched in Maymbung. The gunboats, some marines, and\r\nSultan Harun's small force attacked the settlement by sea. Governor\r\nArolas led the land troops himself and marched against Maymbung at\r\nnight. The Moros of the interior harassed the advancing troops from\r\nall sides, but everything that could be reached was burned and more\r\nthan 40 Sulus were disabled or killed before the fort of Maymbung was\r\nreached. The latter was a square 75 meters on each side, built partly\r\non land and partly in the water. The walls on the land side were\r\nconstructed of coral rock, while those toward the sea were built of\r\ndouble rows of piles filled behind with stone and earth. Large cannon\r\nand breech-loading rifles were abundantly used by the Sulus and one\r\nrapid-firing gun commanded the main approach on the land side. The\r\nfighting was fierce and heroic on both sides. Out of a large force\r\nof Sulus defending the fort and town 250 lay dead after the battle\r\nwas over. The Spaniards lost 17 dead and 96 wounded. The sea forces,\r\nafter caring for the Chinese population, set fire to the whole town\r\nand reduced it to ashes. Governor Arolas was highly praised in Manila\r\nand Madrid and was later promoted to be a brigadier-general.\r\n\r\nIf military operations, war, and death are efficient and suitable\r\nmeasures to daunt the Sulus, coerce their will, and make them yield\r\nto superior authority, this Maymbung campaign should certainly have\r\nproduced the desired result. Many thought that the moral effect of this\r\nvictory was excellent beyond measure and for that reason entertained\r\ngreat hopes. Governor Arolas felt the cause of Spanish sovereignty\r\nand suzerainty to be amply vindicated and Spanish honor strongly and\r\nproudly upheld, but as early as the 9th of May another fight stared\r\nhim in the face. Arolas and Sultan Harun had to march against Parang\r\nand invest the kuta of Panglima Damang. After the surrender of Damang\r\nan expedition was sent to Lati and another to Tapul Island. This\r\nlatter campaign was extremely difficult and trying. The country was\r\nrough, the forest thick, and the enemy fierce. Panglima Sayadi would\r\nnot recognize Harun's sultanate and would not obey the mandates of\r\nthe governor of Sulu, so his chastisement was decreed and Tapul was\r\nattacked. Sayadi and his men fought like tigers at bay, and Governor\r\nArolas was compelled to lead his troops in person. Sayadi was defeated\r\nafter two days' fighting, 90 of his men were killed, and the fort was\r\ndemolished. The Spanish casualties were 13 dead and 155 wounded. Sultan\r\nHarun reconnoitered the shores and interior of the island, destroyed\r\nsmall forts, and obtained the surrender of several chiefs.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of July, 1887, Pangian Inchi Jamila presented herself at\r\nJolo and expressed her submission and that of Raja Muda Amirul Kiram\r\nto the governor of Sulu and to Sultan Harun. Governor Arolas insisted\r\nthat Amirul Kiram should come personally and express his surrender,\r\nand allowed him ten days in which he could come with safety and\r\nimpunity. After her return Pangian Inchi Jamila sent Sultan Harun\r\nthe seal of the sultanate; but neither the chiefs nor Amirul Kiram\r\nhimself agreed to the personal surrender requested. Governor Arolas was\r\ndisposed to make Spanish sovereignty over Sulu a fact, absolute and\r\ncomplete, and required implicit obedience. The Sulus had a different\r\nview of the respective rights of the two governments and continued\r\ntheir resistance. Another campaign was necessary on Siasi Island,\r\nand Datu Hiyang and many Moros were killed.\r\n\r\nAnother expedition was directed against Kadungdung and southern Lu'uk\r\nand another against the Island of Pata. Innumerable hardships were\r\nsustained by the troops and many Sulus were killed. Sultan Harun\r\nand his forces coöperated with the Spanish forces and reconnoitered\r\ninaccessible places. The partisans of the young Raja Muda Amirul Kiram\r\nwere supposed to have been completely vanquished and the young prince\r\nwas expected to humiliate himself before Sultan Harun at any time. Such\r\nhopes were, however, false, for on October 30 Bwal and the northern\r\nLu'uk district had to be punished. After some fighting the Sulus\r\nevacuated Bwal and fled to the mountains and 53 houses were reduced to\r\nashes; nor was this sufficient, for in 1888 expeditions amounting in\r\nsome cases to 1,500 troops, comprising from two to four companies of\r\nartillery, were conducted against Purul, Tambang, Patikul, Taglibi,\r\nBuhanginan, Pandan, Sari`ul, and Pigi-Dahu. Hundreds and probably\r\nthousands of Sulus were killed, but notwithstanding, Arolas's cruel\r\nefforts to force Sultan Harun upon the people resulted in failure. The\r\nSulus scorned Sultan Harun and his apparent supremacy, persisted in\r\ntheir resistance, and kept their allegiance to Amirul Kiram. True to\r\ntheir traditions they remained faithful to the candidate whose right\r\nto the succession was in their estimation and conviction stronger\r\nthan any other claim backed by the forces of General Arolas.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the year 1886 Datu Uyung invited Datu Aliyud Din\r\nback to Patikul, where he remained for about one year. Datus Kalbi\r\nand Julkarnayn joined the party of Aliyud Din and defended him against\r\nAmirul Kiram and Sultan Harun.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 Patikul and Lati were attacked by Governor Arolas and Datu\r\nAliyud Din fled to Siasi and Laminusa, from there he returned, late in\r\n1888, to Bunbun and Patikul; there he lived quietly until his death,\r\nabout 1892.\r\n\r\nThe administration of Governor Arolas was the longest in duration,\r\nthe most eventful, the most interesting, and the most warlike\r\nadministration Sulu had under Spanish rule. The difficult situation\r\nthe governor found at his arrival, his misunderstanding of the Sulu\r\ncharacter and underestimation of Sulu public opinion, his integrity,\r\nhis exalted opinion of Spanish sovereignty and honor, his disregard of\r\ntreaties and precedent, his ability as a commander of troops, and his\r\nwarlike policy, all combine to make a picture vivid in its colors and\r\nunique in its make-up. Governor Arolas can not be held responsible\r\nfor what had transpired prior to his appointment as governor, and\r\nthe policy he followed was probably dictated for him in general\r\nfrom Manila; but it is difficult to conceive of a man executing\r\nhis duty with such vigor, earnestness, and thoroughness as General\r\nArolas did, unless his heart and soul approved of such a policy and\r\nadded enthusiasm and zest to the impetus of duty. Furthermore, there\r\nare many reasons for believing that Governor Arolas recommended the\r\nmain lines of the policy he pursued. At all events he impersonates,\r\nas far as the object of this work is concerned, that combined agency\r\nof government which is responsible for the significant events of\r\nhis administration of Sulu affairs. In commenting upon his policy\r\nit would therefore be proper to refer to him personally, without the\r\nleast intention of fixing the blame on anybody, or indeed of finding\r\nfault at all, but with the sole intention of eliciting the facts and\r\nshowing the actual condition of affairs in their proper light.\r\n\r\nIn going over the long list of expeditions and campaigns conducted\r\nby General Arolas and of the casualties on both sides, one can not\r\nhelp but express admiration, surprise, or blame as to the justice\r\nor advisability of the policy pursued, its motives, conduct, and\r\neffect. For, if the treaty of 1878 was still in force--and there is\r\nno reason to suppose that it was abrogated--why did Governor Arolas\r\ninstitute new rules and conditions pertaining to the sultanate\r\nand render compliance with them necessary for qualification and\r\nconfirmation? If by virtue of the prerogative of sovereignty it was\r\ndeemed necessary to interfere with Sulu internal affairs and customs\r\nfor a beneficial and good purpose, why was it not right then to\r\noppose and check Datu Aliyud Din as soon as it became evident that the\r\nmajority of the Sulus wanted Amirul Kiram as sultan and Aliyud Din had\r\nrefused to honor the governor's proposals and recommendations? Why was\r\nit not considered right for the Government to object to war between\r\nthe contending parties from the beginning and to assume for itself\r\nall the powers and prerogatives of a protector or arbitrator? If the\r\ngood of the Sulus was the ultimate object sought, why was not the\r\nrightful heir supported from the beginning and advantage taken of\r\nsuch an opportunity to enlist the sympathy of one party, at least,\r\non the side of the Government, strengthen the weak head of the nation,\r\nand bring order and tranquillity out of chaos and anarchy?\r\n\r\nApparently the worthy cause of peace and Sulu welfare were\r\ncompletely overlooked, while the main object of asserting power\r\nand gaining supremacy was pressed and prosecuted at the expense\r\nof a thousand souls and war with every strong chief throughout the\r\nwhole Archipelago. Governor Arolas trampled on the treaty, assumed\r\narbitrary and absolute authority, and treated noncompliance with\r\nhis wishes as disloyalty and insurrection. This attitude might have\r\nbeen due to his peculiar military training and ideas, but it was\r\ncertainly unjust and overbearing. Nations can not be trampled under\r\nfoot without bringing about resentment and retaliation and people\r\ncan not be treated as privates in a company of disciplinarios or\r\ndeportados. The result of such coercion is hatred, and the effect\r\nof abuse is enmity. Such methods do not tend to civilize a country\r\nor better its chances of progress. They kill ambition, harden the\r\nheart, and dull the senses. The first step toward the progress of\r\na subordinate nation is imitation of its superior; but imitation is\r\ngenerally engendered by admiration and kindly influences, and cruel\r\nwarlike measures are certainly disposed to kill such good agencies.\r\n\r\nSulu military operations ceased soon after the arrival of\r\nGovernor-General Weyler in Manila, and some of the Jolo forces were\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\nGeneral Arolas left Jolo in 1893 and was succeeded by Col. Cesar\r\nMattos, who was in turn followed by Gen. Venancio Hernandez before the\r\nend of the same year. The successors of General Arolas did not have\r\nsimilar motives for upholding Harun's sultanate against overwhelming\r\nodds. They saw in him a weak and vacillating sultan who was a burden\r\nto the state. Consequently Sultan Harun was relieved in 1894, and he\r\nreturned to his home in Palawan. During his incumbency Sultan Harun\r\nlived at Mubu in the vicinity of Jolo. The house he occupied was the\r\nbest building ever occupied by a Sulu sultan. He was ambitious and\r\nwilling to reform his people, but he never had a strong following\r\nand was very unfortunate in that he had to fight so hard and so often\r\nfor a nominal allegiance and false support from his people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE OF SULTAN JAMALUL KIRAM II\r\n\r\nRaja Muda Amirul Kiram, who fought and suffered so long for the throne\r\nof his father and brother, succeeded Sultan Harun and assumed the\r\nname of Sultan Jamalul Kiram II. He was not obliged to go to Manila\r\nin order to be vested with proper authority by the Governor-General,\r\nbut it seems that he pledged himself in one way or another to pay some\r\ntribute to the Spanish Government, and consequently a decree was issued\r\nby Governor-General Blanco on March 1, 1894, directing a general census\r\nof the Moros of the Sulu Archipelago and the collection of a tax of 1\r\nreal [222] from each individual. The proceeds of this tribute, after\r\ndeducting the allowances made for the interpreters and collectors,\r\nwere to be devoted to the development of the institutions of Jolo, and\r\nespecially to the construction of roads. It is said that the sultan\r\nwas unable and unwilling to collect the tribute so decreed, but that\r\nhe paid from his own purse the sum of P10,000 or its equivalent on\r\nthe basis of a population of 100,000 and at the rate of 1 real per\r\nperson. The collection of this tax was abandoned in the following\r\nyear and was never resumed.\r\n\r\nThe Sulus' adherence to the cause of Jamalul Kiram II was not based on\r\nany personal influence he exerted on the people, but on the influence\r\nof his mother and the people's devotion to the house of Jamalul Kiram\r\nI. Datu Aliyud Din's claim was theoretically strong, but for various\r\nreasons his party weakened; while Amirul Kiram, though a fugitive,\r\ngradually gained in influence and rose to power.\r\n\r\nThe administration of Governor Hernandez was the longest in duration\r\nnext to that of Governor Arolas and was, on the whole, peaceful and\r\ntranquil. On one occasion in 1895 hostilities broke out with Datus\r\nJulkarnayn and Kalbi, and the Sulus of Lati and Patikul attacked\r\nthe town of Jolo causing several casualties. However, peace was\r\nsoon restored by Governor-General Blanco and no further hostilities\r\noccurred. Governor Hernandez built the direct road, known as the\r\nAsturias Road, which leads from the gate of the walled town to Fort\r\nAsturias. About 1897 General Hernandez was relieved by Col. (later\r\nBrig.-Gen.) Luis Huerta, the last Spanish governor of Sulu.\r\n\r\nSpain evacuated Sulu in May, 1899, and Jolo was garrisoned by American\r\ntroops on the same day. On the 20th of August Gen. J. C. Bates\r\nconcluded a treaty with Sultan Jamalul Kiram II, generally known as\r\nthe \"Bates Agreement,\" and the sovereignty of Sulu passed from Spain\r\nto the United States of America. [223]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL STATUS OF SULU AT THE TIME OF SPANISH EVACUATION\r\n\r\nThe cause for which Governor Arolas shed the blood of several\r\nhundred Spanish soldiers and killed some thousands of Moros was\r\nutterly defeated. The tenacity with which the Sulus resisted Spanish\r\ndomination, their obdurate opposition and bravery in battle, and their\r\nobstinate passive resistance in peace, baffled all Spanish efforts\r\nto subvert their political organization or gain a single point of\r\nadvantage without paying too dearly for it. The Sulus succeeded at\r\nlast in inaugurating their candidate as Sultan of Sulu. Their laws\r\nand the administration of their internal affairs were not interfered\r\nwith. Their religion, social conditions, national usages and customs\r\nwere unaffected by any change whatsoever. Spanish influence and\r\njurisdiction did not extend beyond the limits of the garrison and no\r\nmaterial reform or progress reached the Moro community through that\r\nchannel. No effort was made by Spain to educate the Sulus and no\r\nadequate measure was proposed by her governors which was applicable\r\nto the needs of the Sulus and acceptable to their ideas. The Sulus\r\nfelt that there was a strong inclination on the part of the Spanish\r\nGovernment or some of its recognized agents to change their religion\r\nand destroy their national unity, and consequently they never had\r\ncomplete confidence in Spanish officers and representatives and\r\nrepulsed every influence that tended to establish close relations\r\nbetween them and the Christians of the Spanish garrison.\r\n\r\nNo tax or tribute was collected from the Sulus, and their territory was\r\nexempted from the operation of the laws of the Philippine Islands. Sulu\r\nimports could come in Sulu craft free of duty and unhampered by any\r\nvexatious regulation. Duties could be collected by Sulus at all ports\r\nunoccupied by Spain; and if hostilities could have been brought to an\r\nend, the Sulus, in their pursuit of the peaceful vocations of life,\r\nmight have felt no appreciable difficulty or inconvenience from\r\nSpanish occupation of Jolo, except the loss of the revenues of the\r\nports of Jolo and Siasi and some control over the trade of the Chinese.\r\n\r\nSlavery remained an established institution of the land and its\r\ncontinued practice among the Moros was neither denounced nor\r\nrestricted. The pearl industry remained in the hands of the Sulus\r\nand pearl fishers and shell dealers paid a variable tax to the sultan\r\nand local chiefs. Piracy was completely suppressed, and the invasion\r\nof Christian communities and the capture of Christians as slaves by\r\nSulus terminated at the conquest of Jolo in 1876.\r\n\r\nBefore the campaign of 1876 the sultan ruled with a strong hand, lived\r\nin state, was prosperous and had considerable wealth. The principal\r\ndatus lived at Jolo, and the Sulu forces were united. Jamalul A`lam\r\nremained rich until his death, but subsequent wars and licentiousness\r\nreduced the estate of his sons. The separation and dispersion of the\r\ndatus, however, weakened the Sulus more than any other cause. Each datu\r\nbegan to feel more or less independent of the other, their jealousies\r\nincreased and became more intense and effectual; their forces were\r\ndisunited, and each chief relied solely upon his own fortifications and\r\nfollowing. United action was ignored or became impracticable. Soon the\r\nsubordinate chiefs began to feel their importance, gradually asserted\r\ntheir rights, and assumed greater dignity and power in proportion to\r\ntheir prosperity and the following they could command. Jamalul A`lam\r\nruled firmly, had every chief under his control, and held the state\r\nintact. Three chiefs outside of his house were sufficient to sign the\r\ntreaty he made with Spain. These were Datu Harun, Datu Raja Lawut\r\nZaynul `Abidin (Asibi), the father of Datus Kalbi and Julkarnayn,\r\nand Datu Muluk Bandarasa Pula, the son of the famous Datu Daniel,\r\nand the father of the present Datu Pula-pula of Mubu or Tandu. No\r\nmaharajas or hadjis figured prominently in those days, and the\r\npanglimas served as state messengers.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it became known that Jamalul A`lam was dying a condition\r\nbordering on anarchy arose and disorder prevailed as in the days of\r\nBadarud Din. Things grew worse during the regency of Datu Aliyud\r\nDin, and worse still during the civil strife between the latter\r\nand Raja Muda Amirul Kiram. General Arolas and Sultan Harun had to\r\nfight every chief in his turn and every island by itself. Each chief\r\nfelt independent of the rest of the country and had his own ideas\r\nas to who should be appointed sultan. Each datu was defended by\r\nhis own men only and each had to meet the Spanish forces by himself\r\nunaided. Even Maymbung had to face the mighty foe with forces which\r\ncould be assembled from the immediate neighborhood only. Small\r\ndetachments did sometimes reënforce the forts of their neighbors,\r\nbut the proportion of help so extended to the actual strength of\r\nthe forces that could have been united was so insignificant that no\r\naccount can be taken of such coöperation.\r\n\r\nThus the total or combined strength of Sulu was reduced to small,\r\ninsignificant and disunited entities; the power of resistance\r\nto outside invasion was diminished, but at the same time the\r\nsusceptibility of the country to foreign influence became nil. It\r\nwas an easy matter for General Arolas to defeat one party or chief\r\nalone, but the necessity of fighting each chief by himself defeated\r\nhis purpose and efforts in the end. Unconsciously, Spain brought\r\non an abnormal condition of affairs in Sulu, extremely difficult to\r\nmanage and for which she never found the proper remedy. The ruling\r\nsultan, though well supported by the greater mass of the people,\r\nhad neither the knowledge, the tact, nor the strength necessary to\r\ncorrect the wrong done, and things in general tended rather to the\r\nworse than to the better. The parties created by the civil strife of\r\n1884 existed in 1899 with very little change, and their enmity had\r\nbecome deeply rooted and ineradicable. The whole northern portion\r\nof the island east of Jolo and eastern Tandu represented a distinct\r\nparty unfavorable to Jamalul Kiram II and at times seemed to be\r\nwholly under the leadership of the two brothers, Datus Kalbi and\r\nJulkarnayn. Similar parties existed in Tapul, Lugus, Siasi, and the\r\nTawi-tawi Group, many settlements having two chiefs, one representing\r\nthe sultan and the other the hostile party. To add evil to existing\r\nwrong, the chiefs took advantage of this condition and vacillated in\r\ntheir alliance from one party to another as it seemed to them more\r\nadvantageous for the time being. General Arolas fought both parties,\r\nincurred the bitter enmity of all chiefs and gained for himself and\r\nthe cause of prosperity no advantage whatsoever. All the Sulus hated\r\nSpain at heart and welcomed the end of her sovereignty, with the hope\r\nof having more peace and better relations with her successor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPANISH POLICY\r\n\r\n\r\nATTITUDE OF THE MOROS\r\n\r\nThe vivid picture presented by the history of Sulu thrills the reader\r\nwith scenes of horror, cruelty, and misdirected energies. On one page\r\nwe read of how a rich and mighty sovereign stretched his hand across\r\nthe border of his domain into the territory of his weak neighbor and\r\ncoveted his jewels and treasure, and, being refused, struck terror,\r\ndesolation, and destruction in the home of the latter. On another\r\npage we read how, as if possessed by a mighty demon, that weak and\r\npetty king-neighbor summoned the powers of the wind and sea to his aid,\r\nmarched upon his strong enemy in the night, assailed him while unaware,\r\nrobbed his house, and carried his people away to work for his homely\r\nsustenance. The mighty sovereign wakens in the morning, and in his\r\nrage curses his wretched neighbor and swears vengeance upon him and\r\nhis wicked fellow nomads of the sea, but the rich and mighty lord of\r\nthe north has enemies and rivals in the west and far south and does\r\nnot dare leave his home unguarded. Part of his available warriors\r\nhe thought would be sufficient, and their valor and patriotism were\r\ncounted on as an additional asset and a sure guaranty of victory. The\r\nsails of a gigantic fleet were unfurled and chariots and steeds were\r\nprovided for the triumphal march into the enemy's pearl land. But\r\nthe mighty sea rolled and the furious winds blew and the giant did\r\nnot prove a match for the weak, for man can not go against nature,\r\nand valor is a poor aid against overwhelming odds. Yet some men's\r\nhearts are made of stone and one or two experiences do not teach them\r\nenough; so we see the same scene repeated time and time again, until\r\nan opportune moment arrived and a new chapter was opened in which we\r\nfind the rich sovereign richer and mightier. This time nature takes\r\nsides with might and turns the scales against the weak and petty king\r\nof the south and leaves him wrecked and stranded on his coral reefs.\r\n\r\nThe Sulu is a Malayan of prominent type, reared in his infancy\r\nby a Brahman priest and brought up to maturity under the care of a\r\nMohammedan instructor. He rejected his idols as early as 1450 and had\r\nbeen for more than a century prior to the arrival of Legaspi at Cebu,\r\na faithful and devoted worshipper of \"Allahu Ta'ala,\" the Almighty and\r\nonly God, according to the teaching of the prophet Mohammed and the\r\nholy Quran. He had laws, an established government, an organized state,\r\nan alphabet, and a system of education. By trade he was a planter and\r\nfisher, and both land and sea yielded him plenty. He turned the timber\r\nof his rich forests into boats and utilized the currents of the sea\r\nand the movements of the wind. Navigation came natural to him, and he\r\nsailed to distant lands and traded his pearls for silks and spices. He\r\nhad a wide range of experience, and his knowledge of the world was by\r\nno means restricted to one island or to one limited group of islands.\r\n\r\nThe dominion of the Sultan of Sulu was complete and his power was\r\nwell respected throughout the Archipelago. Between Mindanao and\r\nBorneo 150,000 people--Yakans, Samals, and Sulus--lived and obeyed\r\none man. True, the Sulus had no standing army or navy, but they had\r\ninnumerable boats, forts, and firearms, and every able-bodied man was\r\na soldier and a sailor, always armed, and always ready for a call to\r\narms. His immediate neighbors were pagans, or \"infidels,\" who paid\r\nhim homage and tribute. He was the master of the land and the lord\r\nof the southern seas. He was chivalrous in his manners and received\r\nhis friends with liberal hospitality; but he wasted no sympathy or\r\nkindness on his enemy. The enemy of the state was also an enemy to\r\n\"Allahu Ta'ala,\" and no life was deemed too dear to sacrifice for\r\nthe cause of home and God. It was the idea of his home that started\r\nthe blood rushing through his veins, and religion fittingly fanned\r\nthe flame and heated his blood to the boiling point. There is honor\r\neven among thieves, and a nation made up of fierce pirates need not\r\ngo begging for dignity, gallantry, and self-pride. Let the Sulu be\r\nidolatrous or a fire worshiper and he will \"go juramentado\" on the\r\nstrength of his faith in wooden or fire gods before he yields to a\r\nmaster or serves as a slave. He will die before he surrenders. Such\r\nmetal is what makes the Sulus brave, independent, and unyielding.\r\n\r\nThe Sulus watched the progress of Legaspi at Cebu, Panay, and Luzon,\r\nsaw how the pagan chiefs were subjugated, and witnessed the expulsion\r\nof their brother Mohammedans from Manila. They had played this rôle\r\nthemselves, and when the enemy reached their shores they needed no\r\nword of explanation or stimulus to resist, except that which they had\r\nin their breeding and general make-up. Spain instigated hostilities\r\nand coveted their domain; it was not their part to yield, but it was\r\nSpain's clear duty to reëstablish peace before the evils resulting from\r\nwar outweighed the good obtained. This she failed to do, and the Sulus\r\nwere invaded repeatedly and harassed constantly. Bitter animosity\r\nfilled the hearts of the Sulus, and a desire for revenge prompted\r\nthem to retaliate; and what can be expected from people of their race\r\nand civilization except cruelty and barbarity in war! We know that\r\n\"war is hell\" among highly civilized nations and why should we expect\r\nof the Sulus a moral conduct out of proportion to their intellectual\r\ndevelopment and the influences of their civilization and religion? The\r\nlife of an \"infidel\" was not a matter of religious concern to them\r\nat all. The Prophet himself led his people against nonconformists and\r\npromised them reward instead of pardon or intercession before God. The\r\nQuran taught them that patriotism is a part of their religion,\r\nand love of home and family left no place for cowardice and no\r\npatience with humiliation. They therefore fought well and fought\r\ncruelly. They raided the enemy's country, robbed him, and carried\r\naway many slaves. Slavery was also sanctioned by their religion and\r\nformed an established custom or method of punishment which took the\r\nplace of imprisonment and saved the expense of jails and guards.\r\n\r\nHumanity called for different action on both sides; but it evidently\r\nmade no impression on the Sulus. Not satisfied with just measures of\r\nwar and direct retaliation, they developed an abnormal propensity for\r\npiracy, invaded the Spanish domain frequently for the procurement\r\nof slaves and for other wicked purposes, and committed unspeakable\r\nhorrors and atrocities. But to treat evil with evil adds no virtue\r\nto the credit of the other side. We rarely read of wounded Moros\r\nafter an engagement, and, strange to say, all wounds of Moros were\r\ninvariably immediately fatal. If few Moros were ever kindly treated\r\nafter battle, certainly many more were promptly dispatched in a manner\r\nthat terminated suffering and life at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISTAKES AND DIFFICULTIES OF SPANISH RULE\r\n\r\nHad Spain exerted more effort to increase the Jolo garrison in\r\n1646 and trusted the charge of this garrison to an able and upright\r\nadministrator, the fruits of the brilliant conquest of General Corcuera\r\nwould not have been lost, and in all probability the trouble with\r\nSulu would have been ended before the termination of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. However, instead of this course, weak characters were charged\r\nwith the management of affairs, and in place of permanent and strong\r\noccupation of the land an insignificant treaty was made with the Sulus\r\nwith no intention on the part of Spain of keeping it permanently and\r\nwith no hope that it would be kept by the Sulus. Similar mistakes\r\nwere frequently repeated and a cruel inhuman strife marked with an\r\nastounding profuseness of bloodshed and terrible loss of life and\r\nevil of all sorts, was prolonged for the space of three hundred and\r\ntwenty years without any advantage that is worth considering.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of all this, the Sulu has been pictured to the outside\r\nworld as a black devil incarnate, borne in mischief and conceived\r\nin iniquity; without a human characteristic, barbarous and savage as\r\nhis second cousin the orang-utan of Borneo. The Sulu had no means or\r\nchance of pleading his cause before an international court, and his\r\ncry could not be heard or registered by a foreign hand or press. He\r\nwas not met except with a predetermination to fight him. He was not\r\napproached except with the intention of sharing his treasure. He\r\nwas not invited except to surrender his right of government and no\r\nalternative was offered him except tribute or death. It is out of\r\nreason to expect such people to abandon their customs, traditions,\r\ngovernment, and religion without a struggle. It is out of reason to\r\nexpect them to yield to threats and be daunted by a bombshell shot from\r\na distance. The jungle is thick and extensive, their boats and sails\r\nare ready and light; they know the routes of the sea and can follow\r\nthe currents of the ocean in the dark as well as in the light. The\r\ncoasts of Borneo and the Celebes are not too far from them, and living\r\nthere is as cheap and easy as at home. It is beyond reason to expect\r\nthat all sultans, datus, and panglimas will resign their offices,\r\ngive up their rank and privileges, and be content to plant corn on\r\nthe hillside or catch fish along the beach. The laws of nature are\r\nnot ambiguous, and man is man whether his skin is white or brown.\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulties Spain had to contend with in the south arose\r\nout of the natural weakness of her system of administration. Her\r\nGovernors-General changed frequently. The Moro question received\r\na secondary attention, and no definite policy or settled course\r\nof action was ever systematically worked out and followed. What\r\nCorcuera planned was not carried out by his successors, and measures\r\nwhich were approved by General Terrero were disapproved by General\r\nWeyler and ignored by General Blanco. Had Governor-General Urbiztondo\r\npreceded Governor-General Claveria, Jolo might have been attacked and\r\nconquered before 1851, and had Governor-General Malcampo preceded\r\nGovernor-General Urbiztondo, the garrison of Jolo might have been\r\nestablished twenty-five years earlier.\r\n\r\nThe policy of Governor Parrado was not followed by Governor Arolas,\r\nand the plans and pledges of the latter were not fully respected\r\nby his successors. Treaties were made to be broken rather than\r\nto be obeyed, and at the end of three hundred and twenty years of\r\nprotracted relations with Sulu, no satisfactory policy can be said to\r\nhave been decided upon at either Madrid or Manila. The treaty of 1878\r\nwas a temporary expedient. It was not intended to express a policy\r\nnor did Spain intend to restrict her influence to the provisions of\r\na treaty nor to tie her hands so fast for any length of time. Spain\r\nwas intent on the complete conquest of Sulu, the assimilation of all\r\nthe Moro tribes, and the unification of government, religion, and\r\ncivilization throughout the Philippine Archipelago. This ideal was\r\nthe hope of all governors of Sulu and formed a concealed motive that\r\nprompted their actions and guided their administration. The governors\r\nof Sulu differed only in their ideas as to the length of time which\r\nshould pass before the Sulus should be denied their autonomy, and the\r\nmethods by which the change could be best brought around. There were\r\nopportune and inopportune times to interfere, which were left for the\r\nGovernor-General to decide, and in the majority of cases his decision\r\nwas controlled not by the immediate needs of the occasion, but by\r\ninterests pertaining to the general administration of the Archipelago,\r\nwhich left partial attention and inadequate means available for the\r\nsolution of the vexatious difficulties in the south. Generals who\r\nwere anxious to distinguish themselves, took the first opportunity\r\nthat offered itself, but satisfied themselves with the immediate\r\nresults of victory or the simple correction of the wrong calling\r\nfor military action, without bearing in mind the general situation\r\nand the requirements of the next step that should be undertaken as\r\npart of a course planned for the carrying out of a settled general\r\npolicy. Thus bound to observe the general provisions of the treaty\r\nof 1878, and limited in the authority granted them from Manila and in\r\nthe strength of the garrison assigned to Jolo, the governors of Sulu\r\nfelt their hands completely tied, and consequently they could not\r\naccomplish much and left matters to drift with the current of events.\r\n\r\nDuring the governorship of General Terrero, Governor Arolas was\r\ngiven a free hand and sufficient troops to carry out his plan; but\r\nArolas was not much more than a fighting man and an excellent post\r\ncommander, and the evils of his strenuous measures outweighed the good\r\nhe accomplished; and when the Jolo garrison was subsequently reduced\r\nby Governor-General Weyler his policy could not be continued and was\r\nnecessarily doomed to utter failure.\r\n\r\nHowever, nobody was quicker to note such mistakes and to observe the\r\nneeds of the situation than the Spanish officers themselves, especially\r\ninspectors-general who were commissioned to investigate matters and\r\nconditions in Sulu, and historians who made a study of Sulu affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT OF BALTASAR GIRAUDIER\r\n\r\nOf works of this nature we give brief accounts of the estimable\r\nreport of Baltasar Giraudier, Director of the \"Diario de Manila,\"\r\nwhich was presented to the Governor-General, Domingo Moriones, in\r\n1880, and the noteworthy remarks and recommendations of the author of\r\n\"Apuntes sobre Jolo,\" Miguel A. Espina, colonel of infantry.\r\n\r\nBaltasar Giraudier accompanied General Malcampo to Jolo in 1876 and\r\nmade special inquiry into the situation in the south. He clearly\r\nstated that the terms of the treaty of 1851 could not be carried out\r\n(to advantage). Failure to observe this treaty provoked the sultan and\r\nSulus to impatience, resistance, and a rebellious attitude. Referring\r\nto the Jolo campaign of 1876 he estimated the strength of the attacking\r\narmy at approximately 11,000 troops, and described Jolo as an actual\r\nchurchyard, held in a constant state of siege, and a great cost\r\nto the nation in men and money. Naked facts, he asserted, did not\r\njustify former expeditions, and hostilities were often provoked for\r\nulterior motives. Considerable harm resulted from such misdirected\r\nmeasures, while much good to both nations could have been derived from\r\na policy of attraction, frank, loyal, and disinterested. He called the\r\nattention of the authorities to the necessity of a faithful observance\r\nof the terms of treaties, in order to expect and demand with right\r\nand respect a reciprocal observance of such treaties by the Moros;\r\nto the advisability of honoring and strengthening the authority\r\nof the sultan in order to secure his good will and coöperation in\r\nmaintaining peace and harmony and in repressing the evil tendencies\r\nof rebellious datus and subchiefs; to the great advantages that may\r\narise from reëstablishing the salary of the sultan and promoting\r\nthose friendly relations which tend to strengthen the Sulu alliance\r\nand render this state a stronghold and a protecting wall against\r\ninvasion from foreign countries. He condemned the treaty of 1878 as\r\nlimiting the government's freedom of action and checking the progress\r\nand success of the nation's policy.\r\n\r\nHe reiterated that there is great need and necessity of defining\r\nthe policy of the nation relative to Sulu and the Moro country in\r\ngeneral. Such a grave question should be settled on a firm basis\r\nand should not be subject to the caprice of an individual governor\r\nor commander of a war vessel. No opportunity should be allowed for\r\nignorance, malice, false pretexts, and ulterior motives that defame\r\nthe national honor, weaken the policy of the government, or work to\r\nthe detriment of the people and the country. He pointed to several\r\nincidents of wrong conduct or imprudence on the part of officials which\r\nprovoked trouble and war and left on the Moros an impression that the\r\nSpaniards were acting deceitfully and in bad faith. The general policy\r\nhe outlined for the information of the government and for the uniform\r\nconduct of all officials was submitted in the form of recommendations,\r\nthe most important of which are briefly noted as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. The sultan and datus should be treated with respect and\r\n    consideration.\r\n\r\n    2. Immediate justice and impartiality should be strictly\r\n    administered and practiced in all cases and under all conditions,\r\n    especially when crime or outrage is committed against the Moros;\r\n    for such action would demonstrate in an impressive manner an\r\n    upright conduct which would command the fullest respect of the\r\n    Moros and obedience to law and order.\r\n\r\n    3. It is of the utmost importance that the belief, temples,\r\n    and cemeteries of the people be respected.\r\n\r\n    4. The speedy punishment of all Moro misconduct and aggression\r\n    should be secured through the datu or chief.\r\n\r\n    5. The fleet should make frequent visits to various islands to\r\n    familiarize the people with the flag, to map the country, and to\r\n    study conditions in general.\r\n\r\n    6. Religion should be fully tolerated in the same manner as in\r\n    India and Java. Proselytism should be prohibited.\r\n\r\n    7. The sultan should be invited to live in Jolo; an edifice\r\n    should be constructed for his residence which would increase his\r\n    dignity in the eyes of his people; and he should be given a high\r\n    office in connection with the government (as secretary) which\r\n    would engender and promote his interest in the government and\r\n    its welfare and secure needed and desirable coöperation between\r\n    officers and chiefs.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Giraudier pointed to the wisdom of English and Dutch\r\npolicy in affording education to the sons of native princes and\r\nchiefs at public expense, to the necessity of large sacrifices at\r\nthe beginning which would be amply compensated for by a general\r\npacification of the Archipelago in the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIEWS OF ESPINA\r\n\r\nColonel Espina assumed that retrogression was out of the question\r\nand that the flag which was waving over Sulu must be defended and\r\nsupported. Sulu could not be abandoned to her fate and Spanish\r\nsovereignty had inevitably to be exercised. Extermination of Moros\r\nhe held to be absurd and impossible, and measures so directed he\r\nregarded as injurious and unwise. He entertained strong hopes,\r\namounting to actual conviction, that Moros could become Spanish in\r\npolitical organization, sympathy, and civilization, and that their\r\nreligion did not form an obstacle to their reformation and assimilation\r\nunless conversion into the Christian religion was insisted upon and\r\nrigorously kept up. He thought that the cause of religion alone was\r\nsufficient to prolong the war indefinitely and lead the Government to\r\na policy of extermination and failure. Instead of that he advised a\r\nprudent and tolerant policy declaring absolute noninterference with\r\nreligion and hearty coöperation with the Sulus in matters of general\r\nconcern and public welfare. He considered it of great importance to\r\noccupy all the principal islands of the Archipelago with garrisons\r\nand to establish colonies and agricultural stations at the most\r\ndesirable localities and harbors. He wrote at considerable length\r\non the organization of a rural police force to maintain order and\r\ncarry out the various measures of his policy. He pointed out the\r\nadvisability of strengthening the authority of the sultan over Sulus,\r\nof rendering his appointment subject to the approval or choice of the\r\nSpanish Government, and of selecting a council of state loyal to the\r\nSpanish Government and serving under salary. The chief features of\r\nthe policy he outlined are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. The organization of the sultanate should be made or continued\r\n    in accordance with the laws and customs of the country, but in a\r\n    manner agreeable to the interests of the Spanish Government. Rank,\r\n    order, and religion should not be interfered with.\r\n\r\n    2. The sultan and members of the council of state should be\r\n    appointed by the Governor-General and should have salaries.\r\n\r\n    3. A new treaty should be made in order to rectify those clauses\r\n    of the treaty of 1878 pertaining to the maintenance of peace and\r\n    the guarantee of safety of life and property.\r\n\r\n    4. Slavery should be abolished, radically and thoroughly.\r\n\r\n    5. Compulsory tribunals of justice or courts should be established\r\n    to relieve datus and chiefs of the exercise of such functions.\r\n\r\n    6. Commerce should be encouraged and rendered free for all boats\r\n    for a period of twenty-five years.\r\n\r\n    7. Roads should be constructed to facilitate communication and\r\n    transportation from the central region of the island to its\r\n    principal harbors.\r\n\r\n    8. Agriculture should be developed and colonies encouraged.\r\n\r\n    9. Necessities should be created for the Moros, providing them\r\n    at the same time with means for satisfying them. Children of the\r\n    sultan and datus should be educated in Manila, and schools for\r\n    the Moro dialect should be established and made accessible to\r\n    the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPURPOSE OF SPAIN\r\n\r\nA few closing remarks on the purpose and interests of Spain in Sulu and\r\nthe resources she had available for carrying out this purpose may not\r\nbe out of place in order to give the reader a clear idea of the final\r\npolicy which Spain had for Sulu and to enable him to grasp the scope,\r\ncomplexity, and difficulties of this problem. However, in discussing\r\nthese subjects and the changes they were intended to bring about it\r\nmust be remembered that every project on the part of the sovereign\r\nnation or Spain calls for consideration from two points of view--the\r\nfirst is whether the agency employed was sufficient and adequate\r\nto impose the change and carry it through; the second is the amount\r\nof resistance such a project encountered on the part of the subject\r\nnation or Sulu, and in case the resistance could be overcome, whether\r\nor not a nation like that of the Sulus was developed sufficiently\r\nfor the requirements of the change and for subsequent adaptation to\r\nthe system it was proposed to inaugurate.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the treaty of 1878 was not abrogated and no distinct\r\neffort was actually made to disregard it, it should be regarded as the\r\nofficial and most authentic expression of Spain's relation, rights,\r\nand purpose in Sulu. The terms of this treaty gave Spain indisputable\r\nsovereignty over Sulu, the right to occupy all necessary points and to\r\nestablish military garrisons wherever needed, the right to establish\r\ncustom-houses at occupied points, the right to limit or control the\r\nimportation of firearms, the right to suppress piracy and to demand\r\nthe Sultan's coöperation in its suppression.\r\n\r\nThe degree or amount of sovereignty Spain was to exercise over Sulu\r\nwas very indefinitely stated. The term \"indisputable\" does not signify\r\n\"complete,\" as some hasty reports on Moro affairs have expressed\r\nit. The aim of the treaty was to exclude Great Britain, Germany, and\r\nother foreign nations from the Spanish sphere of influence over Sulu,\r\nand the word \"indisputable\" should be interpreted in this sense, which\r\nis clearly expressed in the Sulu text of the treaty. At that time\r\nthere was no intention on the part of Spain to assume the control\r\nof Sulu internal affairs and the Sulus endeavored to guard their\r\ncomplete freedom and right to continue their political organization,\r\nlaws, and religion by specifying those powers which Spain had a right\r\nto exercise over them and by declaring emphatically that all their\r\ncustoms, usages, and religion should not be changed. The Sulu word for\r\n\"customs\" signifies laws, organization, and administrative methods. It\r\nis the political not the social sense of the word about which they were\r\nso very particular. The treaty did not entitle Spain to interference,\r\nor to institute any measure that tended toward political change or\r\nreform in Sulu. The sultan was left supreme in the exercise of his\r\nauthority over Moros. The treaty simply secured undisputed Spanish\r\ncontrol over Sulu's foreign relations and commerce and incorporated\r\nSulu into the Philippine Archipelago in this sense only. It further\r\nestablished peace within the Archipelago by checking any possible\r\nrevival of Sulu piracy. It appears that both distinguished governors,\r\nMartinez and Parrado, interpreted the treaty in this sense, and the\r\nSulus certainly so understood it.\r\n\r\nTwo important steps were taken by Spain later than 1878 in order to\r\nmodify the relations established by the treaty. The first of these\r\nsteps was a resolution to appoint the Sultan of Sulu or control the\r\nsuccession to this office. This occurred in 1886 when Sultan Harun\r\nwas declared by the Spanish Government, in answer to the requests\r\nof Governor-General Terrero and Governor Arolas, as the legitimate\r\nsultan. By this act the Madrid Government asserted its right to a\r\ndegree of actual sovereignty over Sulu internal affairs and backed its\r\nassertion with the necessary force and partially carried it through\r\nat the hands of Governor Arolas. Jamalul Kiram II finally recognized,\r\nto a certain extent, Spain's authority in this matter and accepted\r\nher right of approval or confirmation of the election.\r\n\r\nThe second step was an attempt to exact tribute from the Sulus. This\r\nwas done by a decree issued in 1894 by Governor-General Blanco\r\ndirecting that a census be taken of Sulu and a poll tax of 1 \"real\"\r\nper capita be collected. Advantage was taken at that time of the strong\r\ndesire of Raja Muda Amirul Kiram to become sultan. Sultan Harun was\r\npersuaded to resign, and the measure adopted for the collection of the\r\ntribute resulted in the payment of a sum of money or its equivalent by\r\nAmirul Kiram and the latter's appointment as sultan. The scheme was a\r\ncompromise by which Spain attempted to assume more control over Sulu,\r\nand Amirul Kiram secured his appointment as sultan without having\r\nto go to Manila for this purpose. However, the attempt to impose a\r\ntribute on the Sulus appears to have failed completely. No census\r\nwas taken and no tribute was asked in later years.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of Spain, in accordance with her official declarations,\r\nmay therefore be summed up as follows: 1. Complete control of Sulu\r\nforeign relations; 2. Complete control of Sulu commerce; 3. The right\r\nto appoint the sultan; 4. The right to impose tribute on the Sulus.\r\n\r\nThe first two propositions were legitimate and proper. Both could be\r\naccomplished and retained by virtue of Spain's naval power, merchant\r\nmarine, and friendly foreign relations with the European nations. The\r\nSulus had no navy and no steam vessels. Their native boats could not\r\noffer any significant resistance and were powerless to oppose the\r\nSpanish navy. Ever since 1844 the latter was in the ascendant and by\r\n1870 it had completely overpowered the Sulu naval forces. Both these\r\npropositions were conceded to Spain in the treaty of 1878 and were\r\njustly held ever since. They strengthened the unity of the Philippine\r\nArchipelago and secured strength and permanent internal peace.\r\n\r\nThe third proposition, the right to appoint the sultan, was in effect\r\ndefeated. It was poor policy. At the end of the bloody struggle that\r\narose because if it, Spain retained only the right to confirm the\r\nchoice of the nation. Had Governor Arolas confined himself to this\r\npoint he would have won without a contest and without engendering\r\nhostility and ill feeling toward his Government. Had a test of arms\r\nbeen the sole arbiter of the question Governor Arolas might be said\r\nto have won his point completely, for his forces defeated those of the\r\nSulus in every encounter; but the tenacity of purpose, persistence, and\r\npatriotism of the Sulus outlived his determination, and what was won by\r\nforce and cruelty was given up in the end as inadvisable and impolitic.\r\n\r\nThe fourth proposition fell through. The best argument that can be\r\nadvanced in its favor is that a tribute was actually paid by the\r\nSultan Jamalul Kiram II in 1894 and that the tax was not imposed in\r\nlater years because of the extensive campaign conducted in Mindanao\r\nand the frequent changes of Governor-General, and also because of\r\nthe Tagalog insurrection of 1896. Such argument is more in the nature\r\nof an apology than a defense. There is some significance in exacting\r\ntribute from the Sultan of Sulu, but the principal of the tribute was\r\nutterly defeated. The sultan evidently evaded the question entirely as\r\nsoon as he felt secure in his office. Such a measure would certainly\r\nhave been opposed by the Sulus. They would have risen to a man and\r\nsacrificed more life and treasure in this cause than in the previous\r\none of the appointment of their candidate for the sultanate. The nation\r\nwas somewhat divided in the former case, but in the matter of resisting\r\nthe payment of a tribute there was not a dissenting vote. They would\r\nhave fought most vigorously and unitedly. Governor Arolas did not\r\nexhaust their fighting powers; they could have fought just as well in\r\n1888 as in 1886-87. One party alone advanced against Jolo in 1895,\r\nand a band attacked landing soldiers in 1897. To pay tribute to a\r\nforeign power meant vassalage in their opinion, and this they could\r\nnot tolerate. They would fight, not on the strength of a careful and\r\nintelligent estimate of their power as compared to that of Spain,\r\nbut because they would not tolerate the idea and their national honor\r\nwould prompt them to exhaust their strength before they would yield\r\nto such a humiliating proposition. Their fighting power was only\r\none unit of their national resources; their national independence,\r\nnational character, unity and stability of organization were other\r\nunits which added considerable strength to their resistance. What\r\nthey could not defeat they would have left alone; what they could\r\nnot tolerate they would have evaded; what they could not evade they\r\nwould have run away from.\r\n\r\nAn exaggerated degree of honor and self-pride, uncontrolled by\r\na certain degree of intelligence, culture, and moral courage, is\r\ndangerous. Courage unencumbered by prosperity or wealth and spurred\r\nby abnormal religious sentiment, becomes desperate, reckless, and\r\nfanatical. Moreover the treatment by a highly civilized nation of\r\nanother limited in culture and development is under moral restrictions\r\nsimilar to those pertaining to the treatment by a man of mature age of\r\na minor. A minor can not be blamed for lack of mature reason, and no\r\nmore can be expected of him than he is able to do. He must further be\r\ntreated with equity and justice, though he is weak and helpless. It\r\nwas impossible for the Sulus to change their character at once. It\r\nwas absurd to expect of them any action contrary to their natural\r\ndisposition and national character. It was the duty of the sovereign\r\nnation to recognize the national character of her inferior and treat\r\nher wisely and justly. Tact might have been mightier than an army\r\nand wise measures might have worked wonders. Nations can be educated\r\nand can develop like individuals and force is a poor agent where the\r\ncarrying out of a certain measure is intended to bring about reform.\r\n\r\nSpain imposed tribute upon the Sulus without being prepared to enforce\r\nits collection and before the Sulus were ready for such a measure\r\nand the relation it involved. Granting that the funds derived from\r\nthe tax were to be used for the benefit of the Sulus the principle\r\nunderlying the institution of the tax is repugnant to the people and\r\nno means were used to remedy this feeling or train the people for\r\nits tolerance. No savage or semicivilized nation can be reformed and\r\ngoverned without initial expense, nor can reform be effected in a day,\r\nalthough forces and funds are available in plenty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOURCES OF SPAIN\r\n\r\nIn their bearing on the subject under consideration the resources of\r\nSpain may be divided into three divisions--her fighting power, her\r\ngovernment machinery or system of government, and her racial influence.\r\n\r\nHer fighting power includes all the forces of the army and navy which\r\nshe could bring to bear on Sulu and her ability to support them. The\r\nlargest Spanish force that ever assembled on the soil of Sulu was\r\nthat commanded by Governor-General Malcampo in the expedition of 1876;\r\nthis was estimated at from 9,000 to 11,000 troops. In January, 1888,\r\nthe military forces of the Philippine Islands numbered 12,800 men,\r\nof whom 1,400 were Spaniards and the rest natives. Governor Arolas\r\nnever commanded more than 2,000 troops in his various expeditions\r\nand never needed more than that number. A garrison force of 700 men\r\nproved sufficient to repulse a general attack on Jolo in 1881. We may\r\ntherefore safely conclude that a force of 2,000 native troops stationed\r\nin Sulu was sufficient for all purposes and considerations. Such a\r\nforce should have been kept in Sulu all the time. The moral effect\r\nof maintaining it would be to suppress any attempt at opposition\r\nand to check the tendency to mischief or rebellion. The fact that\r\nthere is a ready force behind an order or request prompts obedience\r\nand conformity, before deceit or plots can have time to grow. Wise\r\nmeasures are more effective and peace is assured. Besides, the honor\r\nof the sovereign power is constantly maintained and no chances for\r\ndisregard or dishonor are allowed. Force back of a wise administrator\r\nis a potent factor for good. It need not be used except rarely and\r\nwhen absolutely necessary. Force is evil only when it is allowed to\r\nrule the head of the administrator and, like every other agency, it is\r\ngood only when it is wisely directed. It was therefore necessary and,\r\nin as far as it was needed to back a competent administration, it\r\nshould have been provided. Spain could have easily kept such a force\r\nin Sulu all of the time. She had the troops and the means to support\r\nthem. She, however, did not do this, and only part of the time did\r\nthe Sulu garrison have the required strength. However, the facility\r\nof transporting troops from Zamboanga to Jolo and the preponderance\r\nof her naval forces reduced this deficiency to a minimum and the\r\nfighting power of Spain may, as far as our purpose is concerned,\r\nbe deemed to have been adequate to rule Sulu.\r\n\r\nThe chief weakness in the Spanish régime lay in her system of\r\ngovernment. Her government machinery proved ineffective and\r\ninadequate. No competent men were educated into the needs of the\r\nsituation and given permanent charge of Sulu affairs. Temporary\r\nmilitary commanders were put in command without the necessary\r\npreparation for the requirements of the office. No special ability was\r\nneeded to conduct an office already organized, to execute laws already\r\nestablished, or to carry out a system of government already laid out;\r\nbut it required higher abilities to establish sovereignty over a\r\nnew state like Sulu, lay down a definite, settled, and wise policy,\r\nand carry out the regeneration and reform of a nation. Besides too\r\nfrequent changes in the office of Governor-General, the governors of\r\nSulu were also allowed too short terms. More than thirteen governors\r\nruled Sulu in the course of twenty-three years, from 1876 to 1899. Not\r\none of these felt that it was his duty to institute a permanent policy\r\nfor Sulu, or believed that he was going to stay long enough to carry it\r\nthrough, and that he was going to be held responsible for its conduct,\r\nwhether it failed or succeeded.\r\n\r\nThe government of a state is entitled to as much consideration as\r\nany business undertaking and there is no reason why it should not\r\nbe conducted on sound and businesslike principles. Such methods as\r\ncharacterized the government of Sulu would have ruined any business\r\nestablishment and could not have done justice to any nation or body\r\nof men it represented. The men in responsible positions trusted the\r\ntransmission of all official actions and communications to interpreters\r\nof limited capacity and strength of character. No governor could\r\nspeak Sulu and verify the translation of his letters and orders. His\r\nknowledge of Sulu affairs and his ideas and opinions were necessarily\r\ncolored by the opinions or designs of his interpreters. The strength of\r\nSpain's assertion and declaration of her rights to rule Sulu, exclude\r\nforeign interests, appoint the Sultan of Sulu, and impose tribute\r\non the Sulus was based on the meaning of the word \"sovereignty\"\r\nwhich does not appear at all in the Sulu text of the treaty of\r\n1878. The Sulu copy of the treaty uses in this connection the word\r\n\"agad\" which means \"follow.\" In the translation of this document from\r\nSulu into English a point was stretched and \"agad\" was interpreted as\r\n\"obey.\" While the Sultans of Sulu felt that they were independent and\r\nfree in their administration of Sulu internal affairs, and that they\r\nwere only obliged to give Spain preference, and ally themselves on her\r\nside when foreign nations interfered, governors like Arolas read the\r\nword \"sovereignty\" in the Spanish text and tried to inforce its full\r\nand actual sense. The Sulus felt that the Spanish governors were thus\r\ntransgressing the limits of their authority, and the Spanish governors\r\nthought at the same time that the Sulus were unreliable and deceitful,\r\na most undesirable and unfortunate condition of affairs.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries in the northern islands acted differently. They talked\r\nthe language of the natives and performed their duties creditably\r\nand with unquestionable success. They understood the people, knew\r\ntheir real conditions, sympathized with them, and worked out their\r\nreligious regeneration admirably. The governors of Sulu did not take\r\nany such view of their duties; they had some zeal, but they lacked that\r\nunderstanding of human nature and the forces of regeneration that the\r\nmissionaries mastered. They had no idea of how a Sulu law or custom\r\ncould be modified and reformed, for they never acquainted themselves\r\nsufficiently with the laws and customs of the people and never paid\r\nmuch attention to the feelings and public opinion of the Sulus. They\r\ntrusted every measure to force and could not think of reform without\r\ncompulsion. A missionary who observed the intense fear of demons on the\r\npart of some pagan Filipinos converted several of them by means of a\r\npicture of hell and satan, and gradually taught them the principles\r\nof Christianity. But the governors of Sulu could never detect any\r\nrelation between Sulu and Spanish laws and could never find a method of\r\napproach from one side to the other. Their form of government failed to\r\nadapt itself to the conditions of the country and could neither merge\r\ninto the Sulu organization nor adapt the Sulu organization to its\r\nsystem. No sympathies bound the two races or the two organizations,\r\nand no foundation for unification and subsequent assimilation could\r\nbe laid. Spanish jurisdiction remained within the garrison, and its\r\nmachinery could find no application outside the walls of Jolo.\r\n\r\nThe amount of force needed to reduce and reform Sulu varies in\r\naccordance with the policy pursued. Considerable light can be thrown\r\non this subject by a study of the circumstances and causes which gave\r\nrise to Datus Ayunan, Mandi, Piang, Ara, and Pedro Cuevas or Kalun.\r\n\r\nDatu Ayunan lived at Taviran and was much lower in rank and influence\r\nthan either the Sultan of Bagumbayan or Datu Utu. Having grievances\r\nagainst Datu Utu he shrewdly allied himself with the Spanish forces and\r\nrendered them valuable assistance. In a short time he rose to power,\r\ndignity, and fame and died greater in the estimation of the country\r\nthan his overlord, the Sultan of Bagumbayan.\r\n\r\nDatu Piang married the daughter of Datu Ayunan and learned his\r\nmethods. As soon as Datu Utu's attitude toward him became unbearable\r\nand hostile he offered his services to the Spanish authorities and won\r\ntheir protection and support. By shrewd tactics he dispossessed his\r\nformer master Utu of his best lands, attracted most of his following\r\nand caused his downfall. At the time of the Spanish evacuation he had\r\nbecome the richest Moro in Mindanao and the most influential chief\r\nin the island.\r\n\r\nDatu Ara had Chinese blood in him. He married his daughter to the\r\nGugu [224] of Magindanao, won the favor of the governor of Kotabato,\r\nand ruled over all Moros on the southern branch of the Mindanao River\r\nbelow Tamontaka. He was strong and well respected.\r\n\r\nDatu Mandi married the daughter of a Samal chief of Zamboanga and\r\nthrough his tact and ability to speak Spanish established for himself\r\na respectable position over the Samals of Mindanao. He served the\r\ninterests of Spain faithfully and bore arms in her behalf against\r\nBisayans and Lanao Moros. The recognition and support he obtained from\r\nthe Spanish Government raised him to the rank of a datu and gave him\r\nsupremacy over all the chiefs of the peninsula of Zamboanga. A close\r\nobservation of Datu Mandi's ability and attitude toward the government\r\nrenders it clear that the influence this man could bring to bear on\r\nhis people was immense. It is no exaggeration to state that had his\r\ninfluence been tactfully utilized, he could have easily, with the aid\r\nof one company of Spanish troops, reduced to submission all Moros and\r\nSubanuns living between Point Flechas and Sindangan on the outskirts\r\nof Dapitan. There never existed a Moro chief more tactful, pliable,\r\nforceful, and favorable to the reorganization of the Moro community\r\nand its system of government along modern and civilized lines.\r\n\r\nWith little aid from the governor of Zamboanga, Pedro Cuevas made\r\nhimself the real lord of northern Basilan. His power was further well\r\nrespected throughout all the Basilan Group of islands. With no more\r\nthan two companies of troops at his disposal he could have acted as\r\nthe Spanish representative and subordinate ruler or governor of all\r\nthe Basilan and Balangingi Groups of islands and could have effected\r\nany reform desired.\r\n\r\nBy tact and ability these men obtained Spanish influence and support\r\nand rose from the lowest ranks of the people to positions of great\r\npower and dignity. Had the Spanish Government employed such men to\r\nfurther its influence by enlarging their following and extending\r\ntheir territories and spheres of activity, there is no doubt that\r\na very significant step would have been taken which would have made\r\nclear to the Spanish authorities successful methods of procedure and\r\nnew lines of policy that lead to success.\r\n\r\nSimilar lines of action could have been adopted in Sulu by taking\r\nadvantage of existing parties and factions. Once the sympathy of\r\none Sulu party was obtained and its forces bore arms on behalf of\r\nor on the same side with Spain, the door would have been opened for\r\neffective influence and wise measures directed along the line of\r\ncleavage would have been bound to produce results. A minimum of force\r\nwould then be needed, and strained relations and discord would give\r\nway to friendship and concord. The history of Sulu is not wanting\r\nin proof that wise attractive methods have been more effective than\r\nforce and arbitrary rule, and, once we reflect upon Abu Bakr's rule\r\nand the wonderful reformation he worked out, then we realize what\r\nwas and what was not a wise policy for Sulu.\r\n\r\nLittle attention has, as a rule, been given to race characteristics\r\nas a potent factor in a nation's policy. The racial character of\r\nthe sovereign nation bears on the ruled nation in several ways--in\r\nthe conduct and demeanor of officials in their official and social\r\nrelations with the chiefs and common people, in the demeanor of\r\nsoldiers and civilians in their social intercourse with the mass of the\r\npeople, and in the industrial or business relations of the two nations.\r\n\r\nThe Sulu datus and chiefs are very courteous and polite and\r\nare unusually keen to notice personal discourtesy. Impulsive and\r\nunconciliatory methods are bitterly resented, and an abrupt manner\r\nmay in itself be sufficient to defeat any measure. The people in\r\ngeneral have no patience with an impetuous officer and hate to be\r\ndiscourteously treated even by their datus. Treated with disrespect\r\nby the authorities or disregarded by the ruling race, they become\r\nexclusive, evasive, indifferent, unsympathetic, and discontented. The\r\nruling race can be polite, courteous, and civil in all its social\r\nrelations with those under it and yet retain its racial supremacy\r\nand social position, and win the respect and submission of the ruled\r\nrace. If ordinary civil duties require good breeding and good manners,\r\nthe duties of the Spanish officer toward the native chiefs certainly\r\ndemanded the highest qualities of a gentleman and the most sympathetic,\r\nupright, and firm disposition possible. Many Spanish officers possessed\r\nthese qualities and conducted their offices with full dignity and\r\ncredit, but it can not be said that all officers were so fully\r\nqualified. Such facts in themselves are sufficient to determine the\r\nquality of the person to whom state affairs in Sulu should be trusted.\r\n\r\nFurther, the reform of a nation can never be fully accomplished without\r\nthe aid of her chiefs and leaders. The coöperation of the natives is a\r\nvery potent factor for good, and a system of government which aims at\r\nthe elevation of a conquered nation must find a place in its machinery\r\nfor the activities of natives of ability and influence. Hence the\r\nnecessity of successful coöperation with natives and the importance\r\nof securing higher qualifications in men holding the highest offices\r\nof government. The fewer such officers are and the abler they are,\r\nthe better and safer the result will be. Such men can overcome racial\r\nprejudices and national sentiments and grievances and by the manner in\r\nwhich they discharge their duties, they can command the approval and\r\nrespect of the ruled nation, gain its sympathies to the side of the\r\ngovernment, and maintain peace, prosperity, and good relations between\r\nthe governing and the governed nations. However, these results were\r\nnot obtained by Spain in Sulu. The religion and racial prejudices of\r\nthe two nations were never overcome and the Sulus maintained a feeling\r\nof revulsion and distrust toward Spaniards and Christian Filipinos.\r\n\r\nGreat aid is rendered the government when the ruling race is competent\r\nand resourceful enough to utilize the services of the ruled race and\r\nat the same time give it sufficient space and latitude for the exercise\r\nof its energies and the satisfaction of its ambitions. A most favorable\r\nindustrial relation can be maintained, if the capital of the sovereign\r\nnation can find opportunities to invest in the conquered territory,\r\nbuy up its crude products, and promote its natural resources. The\r\nnatives then find work to do, increase in prosperity, and look upon\r\nthe existence of the ruling race as favorable for their development\r\nand progress, but in case the subjugated nation is crowded out of its\r\nterritories and robbed of its resources by keen competition, greed,\r\nor undue domination on the part of the ruling race, hostilities are\r\nbound to arise and disaffection extends from industrial relations to\r\npolitics and may lead to trouble and rebellion.\r\n\r\nMany Spaniards seemed to regard Sulu as a very desirable country for\r\ncolonization and offered many suggestions as to the most favorable\r\nsites for factories, the best industries that could be developed,\r\nand the best methods and means of exploitation. Several farms were\r\nstarted in the vicinity of Jolo, but they were abandoned even before\r\nthe evacuation of the islands, and no effective step can be said to\r\nhave been taken by Spain to colonize Sulu except the building up of the\r\ntown of Jolo itself. This subject has therefore played no important\r\npart in the policy exercised by Spain in Sulu and very little can be\r\nsaid in this connection. It must, however, be stated that the lands\r\nof the Archipelago of Sulu are extremely limited in area and should\r\nhave been reserved for the Sulus. Perfect disinterestedness should\r\nhave been exhibited by the Spaniards in this regard. [225]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIXES TO PART II\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\nTHE PACIFICATION OF MINDANAO BY RONQUILLO\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas, Dr. Antonio de Morga, Mexico,\r\n1609.] [226]\r\n\r\nShortly after Don Francisco Tello had taken over the governorship,\r\nnews was brought of the death of Esteban Rodriguez de Figueroa in\r\nMindanao by Brother Gaspar Gomez of the Society of Jesus. The latter\r\nbrought the body for burial in the college of Manila, of which Don\r\nEsteban was patron. Juan de la Xara wrote that he had charge of\r\naffairs, that he had settled in Tampakan, [227] that he intended to\r\ncontinue the pacification and conquest of the island as should seem\r\nmost advisable, and that reënforcements of men and other things should\r\nbe sent him. It was learned that he intended to make an ill use of\r\nthe government, and would not remain dependent on, and subordinate\r\nto, the governor of the Philippines; and that he was depriving the\r\nheirs of Esteban Rodriguez of what lawfully belonged to them. It\r\nwas learned that, in order to make himself safer in this respect,\r\nhe was sending his confidants to the town of Arévalo in Oton where\r\nDon Esteban had left his wife, Doña Ana de Osseguera, and his two\r\nsmall daughters, with his house and property, to persuade Doña Ana\r\nto marry him. This resolution appeared injurious in many respects,\r\nand the attempt was made to rectify matters. But in order not to\r\ndisturb the affairs of Mindanao, the matter was left alone for the\r\npresent, until time should show the course to be followed. And so it\r\nhappened that when Juan de la Xara left the camp and settlements of\r\nMindanao, and came hurriedly to Oton to negotiate his marriage in\r\nperson--although the widow of Don Esteban had never been favorable\r\nto it--Don Francisco Tello sent men to arrest him. He was brought to\r\nManila, where he died while his trial was being conducted.\r\n\r\nAfter the imprisonment of Juan de la Xara, Don Francisco Tello\r\nimmediately sent Captain Toribio de Miranda to Mindanao, with orders to\r\ntake command of the camp and to govern until some one should agree\r\nto continue the enterprise. When he arrived at Mindanao and the\r\nsoldiers saw that Juan de la Xara's schemes had been defeated, and\r\nthat the latter was a prisoner in Manila, with no hope of returning,\r\nthey obeyed Toribio de Miranda and the orders that he brought.\r\n\r\nIn Manila the governor was considering carefully the necessary\r\nmeasures for continuing the war, since the island of Mindanao was so\r\nnear the other pacified islands, and the island itself contained some\r\nprovinces that professed peace and were apportioned as encomiendas\r\nand had Spanish magistrates, such as the rivers of Butuan, Dapitan,\r\nand Karaga, so that it was desirable to pacify the whole island and\r\nsubject it to His Majesty. The royal treasury was spent and could\r\nnot bear the expense; and Esteban Rodriguez had bound himself by a\r\nlegal writ to carry the war to entire completion at his own expense,\r\nin accordance with the terms of his agreement. The guardian of his\r\nchildren and heirs brought the matter before the court, and refused\r\nto fulfill this obligation on account of Esteban Rodriguez's death. In\r\norder not to lose time, for what had been commenced had to be continued\r\nin one way or another, the governor decided to prosecute it, drawing\r\nthe necessary funds from the royal treasury, either on its own account\r\nor on the account of Esteban Rodriguez's heirs, if such should be\r\naccording to law. The governor then searched for a person to go to\r\nMindanao, and selected Don Juan Ronquillo, general of the galleys. The\r\nlatter was given the necessary reënforcements of men and other things,\r\nwith which he reached Mindanao. He took command of the Spanish camp and\r\nfleet which he found in Tampakan. He confirmed the peace and friendship\r\nwith the chiefs and people of Tampakan and Lumagan, restored and set\r\nin better order the Spanish settlement and fort, and began to make\r\npreparation for the war against the people of Bwayan. [228] He spent\r\nmany days in making a few incursions into their land and attacks on\r\ntheir forts, but without any notable result, for the enemy were many\r\nand all good soldiers, with plenty of arquebuses and artillery, and\r\nhad fortified themselves in a strong position. They had many other\r\nfortifications inland and went from one to the other with impunity,\r\nwhenever they wished, and greatly harassed the Spaniards, who were\r\nlittle used to so swampy a country. The latter found themselves short\r\nof provisions without the possibility of getting them in the country\r\non account of the war, inasmuch as the camp contained many men,\r\nboth Spaniards and the native servants and boatmen, and it was not\r\neasy at all times to come and go from one part to another in order\r\nto provide necessities.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Don Juan Ronquillo, seeing that the war was advancing very\r\nslowly and with little result, and that the camp was suffering, drew up\r\na report of it, and sent letters in all haste to Governor Don Francisco\r\nTello, informing him of the condition of affairs. He wrote that it\r\nwould be better to withdraw the camp from Mindanao River, so that\r\nit might not perish; and that a presidio could be established on the\r\nsame island in the port of La Caldera, which could be left fortified,\r\nin order not to abandon this enterprise entirely, and so that their\r\nfriends of Tampakan and Lumagan might be kept hostile to the people of\r\nBwayan. Meanwhile he and the rest of the camp and fleet would return\r\nto Manila, if permitted, for which he requested the governor to send\r\nhim an order quickly. Upon the receipt of this dispatch, Governor Don\r\nFrancisco Tello resolved to order Don Juan Ronquillo, since the above\r\nwas so and the camp could not be maintained, nor the war continued\r\nadvantageously, to withdraw with his whole camp from Mindanao River. He\r\nwas first to make a great effort to chastise the enemy in Bwayan, and\r\nthen to burn the Spanish settlement and fort and go to La Caldera,\r\nfortify it, and leave there a sufficient garrison with artillery,\r\nboats, and provisions for its maintenance and service. Then he was\r\nto return to Manila with the rest of his men, after telling their\r\nfriends in Tampakan that the Spaniards would shortly return to the\r\nriver better equipped and in great numbers.\r\n\r\nSilonga [229] and other chiefs of Bwayan were not neglecting their\r\ndefense, since, among other measures taken, they had sent a chief\r\nto Ternate to ask assistance against the Spaniards who had brought\r\nwar into their homes. Thereupon the King of Ternate dispatched a\r\nnumerous fleet of caracoas and other boats to Mindanao with cachils\r\n[230] and valiant soldiers--more than 1,000 fighting men in all--and\r\na quantity of small artillery, in order to force the Spaniards to\r\nbreak camp and depart, even could they do nothing else. When the news\r\nreached Bwayan that this fleet was coming to their defense and support,\r\nthey made ready and prepared to attack the Spaniards, who also having\r\nheard the same news were not careless. Consequently the latter turned\r\ntheir attention more to the main fort, and reduced the number of men\r\nin the smaller forts on Butil [231] River and other posts, mouths,\r\nand arms of the same river. These served to strengthen the garrison of\r\nthe main fort and the armed galleys and other smaller craft, in order\r\nto use the latter to resist the expected attack of the enemy. The\r\nenemy having gallantly advanced to the very fort of the Spaniards\r\nwith all their vessels and men, attacked and stormed it with great\r\ncourage and resolution, in order to effect an entrance. The Spaniards\r\nwithin resisted valiantly, and those outside in the galleys on the\r\nriver assisted them so effectively that together, with artillery and\r\narquebuses, and at times in close combat with swords and kampilan,\r\nthey made a great slaughter and havoc among the men of Ternate and\r\nthose of Bwayan, who were aiding the former. They killed and wounded a\r\ngreat number of them and captured almost all the caracoas and vessels\r\nof the enemy, so that very few boats escaped, and they were pursued\r\nand burned by the Spaniards, who made many prisoners and seized immense\r\nbooty and many weapons from the enemy. As soon as possible after this,\r\nthe Spaniards turned against the settlements and forts of Bwayan where\r\nsome of their results were of so great moment that the enemy, seeing\r\nthemselves hard pressed and without anyone to help them, sent messages\r\nand proposals of peace to Don Juan Ronquillo, which were ended by their\r\nrendering recognition and homage, and the renewal of friendship with\r\nthe people of Tampakan, their ancient enemy. In order to strengthen\r\nthe friendship, they sealed it by the marriage of the greatest chief\r\nand lord of Bwayan with the daughter of another chief of Tampakan,\r\ncalled Dungunlibur. Thereupon the war was apparently completely ended,\r\nprovisions were now to be had, and the Spaniards with little precaution\r\ncrossed and went about the country wherever they wished. The people of\r\nBwayan promised to dismantle all their forts immediately, for that was\r\none of the conditions of peace. Then the Spaniards returned to their\r\nfort and settlements at Tampakan, whence Don Juan Ronquillo immediately\r\nsent dispatches to Governor Don Francisco Tello, informing him of the\r\ndifferent turn that the enterprise had taken. In view of the present\r\ncondition he requested the governor to issue new instructions as to\r\nhis procedure, saying that he would wait without making any change,\r\nnotwithstanding the arrival of the answer which he expected to his\r\nfirst report, for conditions had now become so much better than before\r\nthat the governor's decision would be different.\r\n\r\nThe governor had already answered Don Juan Ronquillo's first dispatch,\r\nas we have said above, when the second dispatch arrived with news\r\nof the successes in Mindanao. Suspicious of the men in the camp who\r\nhad constantly shown a desire to return to Manila, and little relish\r\nfor the hardships of war, and fearing lest they would return at the\r\narrival of the first order, executing that order and abandoning the\r\nenterprise which had reached such a satisfactory stage; and thinking\r\nthat it would be unwise to abandon the river, the governor made haste\r\nto send a second dispatch immediately by various roads, ordering them\r\nto pay no attention to his first orders, but to remain in Mindanao, and\r\nthat he would soon send them what was necessary for further operations.\r\n\r\nIt seems that this message traveled slowly; for, the first having\r\narrived, they obeyed it without any further delay, and camp was\r\nraised and the country abandoned. To their former enemy of Bwayan\r\nthey gave as a reason that the governor of Manila had summoned them;\r\nand to their friends of Tampakan they said that they would leave\r\nmen in La Caldera for their security, and that assistance would be\r\nsent them from Manila. This news caused as much sorrow and sadness\r\nto the latter as joy to the people of Bwayan. Then, after burning\r\ntheir fort and settlement, the Spaniards embarked all their forces as\r\nsoon as possible, left the river, and went to La Caldera, 24 leagues\r\nfarther down in the direction of Manila. Having entered port, they\r\nbuilt a fortress and left there a garrison of 100 Spaniards, with\r\nsome artillery, provisions, and boats for their use.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the governor's second message to General Don Juan\r\nRonquillo arrived, to which the latter replied that he was already\r\nin La Caldera, and could not return to the river. Then, without any\r\nfurther delay, Don Juan Ronquillo went to Manila with the balance of\r\nhis fleet, by way of the Provinces of Oton and Panay. The governor,\r\nhaving heard of his coming, sent to arrest him on the road before\r\nhe entered the city, and proceeded against him by law for having\r\nwithdrawn the camp and army from Mindanao River, without awaiting the\r\norders he should have expected after the favorable turn that affairs\r\nhad taken. Don Juan Ronquillo was set at liberty on showing a private\r\nletter from the governor, which the latter had sent him separately\r\nwith the first instructions, to the effect that he should return\r\nto Manila with his troops in any event, for they were needed in the\r\nIslands for other purposes; and because of this letter Don Juan had\r\ndetermined not to await the second order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II\r\n\r\nTHE PACIFICATION OF MINDANAO [232]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Concerning the pacification of the Island of Mindanao in the\r\nyear 1600.] [233]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the relation of the last year you will have learned how occurred\r\nthe death, in the pacification of the Island of Mindanao, of Esteban\r\nRodriguez de Figueroa, who offered to carry out this pacification\r\nunder the conditions which he stipulated with Gomez Perez Dasmariñas,\r\nformerly governor of these islands, copies of which were sent\r\nto His Majesty and to Master-of-Camp Juan de Lajara, formerly of\r\nthe said expedition, who succeeded to his place when the camp was\r\nabandoned, and came to Manila. Don Francisco Tello, Governor and\r\nCaptain-General of the said Philippine Islands, who at that time\r\nhad taken possession of the government, was considering how to aid\r\nand stimulate the said pacification at the expense of the heirs\r\nof Esteban Rodriguez, and with the agreement of the captains and\r\npersons who were long resident and experienced in war in the said\r\nislands. Don Juan Ronquillo was appointed commander of the galleys\r\nto prosecute the said pacification, and in the meantime, in order to\r\nbe present and continue the expedition, Capt. Toribio de Miranda was\r\nsent forward to encourage and animate the troops, under orders to\r\nkeep them in his charge; and in case the post should be abandoned,\r\nand a retreat made to Manila, he should detain the troops and return\r\nto Mindanao. The said Capt. Toribio de Miranda having arrived at the\r\nIsland [234] of La Caldera, which lies 40 leagues from the river of\r\nMindanao, there found the whole camp, which was returning from the said\r\nislands. Conformably to the orders which he had, he turned back and\r\nfortified the site where they had first been, which was on the river,\r\n4 leagues from the forts of the enemy. Juan Ronquillo, having been\r\ndispatched to Mindanao, had taken the camp in his charge, and begun\r\nto achieve some success. He achieved a victory in the battle which he\r\nfought with the Ternatans, who had entered with 800 men to give aid\r\nto the people of Mindanao. Before these successes, he had written a\r\nletter in disparagement of that country (a copy of which was sent to\r\nHis Majesty), on account of which, in a council of war which had been\r\nheld, the General Don Ronquillo had been ordered to make a last effort\r\nagainst the Mindanaos, doing them all possible damage. He was then to\r\ncome to the Island [235] of La Caldera and there build a fort, to be\r\ngarrisoned with a hundred Spanish soldiers, with artillery, arms, and\r\nmunitions, and leave them there as a check upon Ternate and Mindanao,\r\nin charge of a good soldier, one of the captains of the camp, and\r\nwith the rest return to Manila. Although Don Juan Ronquillo received\r\nthis order, after having won considerable victories, he again wrote\r\nthat he would not abandon that place, even if such were the order,\r\nbecause it would not be expedient to retire from the camp and comply\r\nwith what had been ordered, when he was leaving the Island of Mindanao\r\nalready pacified, the chiefs, with whom he had used gentle means, that\r\nthey might all be more contented, having again rendered submission to\r\nHis Majesty, and likewise as the King of Sulu again rendered obedience\r\nand submission. Confiding in this, Capt. Cristobal Villagra, whom Don\r\nJuan Ronquillo had appointed commander of the garrison of La Caldera,\r\nhad sent 30 soldiers to the Island of Sulu for supplies. They found at\r\nthis time in Jolo a Mindanao chief, an uncle of the King of Mindanao\r\nand a brother-in-law of the King of Sulu, who had been driven out\r\nof Mindanao because he was rebellious. He treacherously killed 13\r\nSpanish soldiers. When news of this was brought, Juan Pacho was\r\nsent to take the troops of La Caldera in charge, and, when it should\r\nseem best to him, to try to inflict punishment with 600 Spaniards;\r\nthe enemy unfortunately killed the said Juan Pacho and 29 Spaniards,\r\nthe rest of them retiring without any success. This news having come\r\nto the governor, he sent in place of Juan Pacho, Capt. Toribio de\r\nMiranda, a person in whom he had entire confidence, with an order not\r\nto attempt any punishment until he had force enough for it. After\r\nthis Capt. Toribio de Miranda arrived at La Caldera on the 26th of\r\nAugust, 1599. When the garrison was given into his charge he put\r\nthe defensive works in order, and with the arms which he brought,\r\nand those which he found in the fort, he armed all the troops,\r\namounting to 114 soldiers. As directed by an order of the governor,\r\nhe sent a chief of the Pintados [Bisayans] to Mindanao with letters to\r\nthe chiefs of the island, in which he informed them that they would be\r\nprotected, favored, and upheld in justice, as vassals of His Majesty,\r\nand that with this object a garrison had been placed in La Caldera;\r\nand that to aid in maintaining it, and in covering the expenses which\r\nthey had caused in the war by their disobedience, the largest possible\r\nquantity of tributes would be collected for His Majesty, and that he\r\nwould send for them shortly, which had not been done earlier because\r\nthe Mindanaos had been so spent and afflicted. Having arrived on the\r\n2d of September at the river of Mindanao, and delivered his dispatch,\r\nthis chief was well received, and found the people in the settled\r\nstate in which Gen. Don Juan Ronquillo had left them. Raja Muda,\r\nthe main chief of Mindanao, in the name of them all, sent him back\r\non the 15th of the said month, offering to give to His Majesty all\r\nthe tribute which they could collect.\r\n\r\nAt this time news from the chief captain of Malacca having reached the\r\ngovernor, to the effect that in the Sunda, [236] 150 leagues from that\r\nport, there had been seen a number of English ships, whose designs were\r\nnot known; and, a little later, word from the commander of the fort of\r\nMaluco that there were at Ternate, within the port, two English ships\r\nwith 400 men and 50 pieces of artillery; a council of war was held\r\nas to what was best to do. The said council decided to withdraw the\r\ngarrison from La Caldera to Cebu, so that the enemy should not take\r\nthat place; and, if they should attempt to do damage to that province,\r\nthey would find it in a state of defense. Accordingly an order was\r\nsent to Capt. Toribio de Miranda to withdraw with the troops, arms,\r\nartillery, and munitions, dismantling the fort; he was also told that\r\nhe could return shortly to the island; with more troops and arms, in\r\norder to assist in its defense. On the 9th of September Capt. Toribio\r\nde Miranda arrived at Cebu, with all the troops, artillery, arms,\r\nand munitions; and at the same time Gen. Don Juan Tello arrived at\r\nCebu with a hundred men, who came as reënforcement from the city\r\nof Manila. Having spent six months there and commenced to build a\r\nfort of stone, the governor, as they had no more news of the English\r\nreferred to, sent an order to the said Don Juan to come to the city\r\nof Manila--which he did with the hundred men. leaving the Province\r\nof Cebu in a prosperous condition, with the troops which are usually\r\nkept there, and those of the garrison of La Caldera, which in all\r\namounted to 250 Spaniards.\r\n\r\nAfter all this, in June of 1600, the governor received news, by way\r\nof Malacca, that the ships which had passed to the South Sea belonged\r\nto Dutch merchants, who had come to load with spices in the Maluco\r\nIslands. Having transacted their business, they had returned to their\r\nown country by way of India, without doing any damage to the islands\r\nof the west; it therefore seems that we are safe, notwithstanding\r\nthe news received of those enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX III\r\n\r\nTHE MORO RAIDS OF 1599 AND 1600\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas, Dr. Antonio de Morga, Mexico,\r\n1609.] [237]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spanish garrison left in La Caldera, at the withdrawal of Don\r\nRonquillo's camp from the river of Mindanao, passed into command\r\nof Captain Villagra at the death of Capt. Juan Pacho in Jolo, and\r\nwas suffering for lack of provisions; for neither the people of the\r\nriver could give them to the Spaniards, nor would the Sulus furnish\r\nany on account of the war declared upon them. Therefore the garrison\r\nurgently requested Governor Don Francisco Tello either to aid their\r\npresidio with provisions, soldiers, and ammunition, or to allow them\r\nto retire to Manila--a thing of which they were most desirous--since\r\nthere they gained no other special result than that of famine, and\r\nof incarceration in that fort, and of no place wherein to seek their\r\nsustenance. The governor, in view of their insistence in the matter,\r\nand having but little money in the royal exchequer, with which to\r\nprovide for and maintain the said presidio and for the same reason\r\nthe punishment that was to be inflicted upon the Sulus for their\r\noutrages upon the Spaniards, and their insurrection was deferred--and\r\nthinking that the return to Mindanao matters would be a long question,\r\nhe was inclined to excuse the difficulty and anxiety of maintaining the\r\npresidio of La Caldera. In order to do it with a reasonable excuse he\r\nconsulted the Audiencia and other intelligent persons, and requested\r\nthem to give him their opinion. But he first communicated his wishes\r\nto them and gave them some reasons with which he tried to persuade\r\nthem to give him the answer that he desired. The Audiencia advised him\r\nnot to remove or raise the garrison of La Caldera, but to reënforce\r\nand maintain it, and to attend to the affairs of Sulu and the river\r\nof Mindanao as soon as possible, even if what was necessary for those\r\ntwo places should be withdrawn from some other section. They said that\r\nthis was the most urgent need, and the one which required the greatest\r\nattention in the islands, both in order to pacify those provinces and\r\nto keep them curbed; lest, seeing the Spaniards totally withdrawn,\r\nthey should gain courage and boldly venture still farther and come\r\ndown to make captures among the Pintados [Bisayans] and carry the\r\nwar to the very doors of the Spaniards. Notwithstanding this reply\r\nthe governor resolved to raise and withdraw the garrison, and sent\r\norders to Captain Villagra immediately to burn the fort which had\r\nbeen built in La Caldera, to withdraw with all his men and ships,\r\nand return to Manila. This was quickly done, for the captain and the\r\nsoldiers of the garrison waited for nothing more than to dismantle\r\nthe fort and leave. When the Sulus saw the Spaniards abandoning the\r\ncountry, they were persuaded that the latter would return to Mindanao\r\nno more, and that they had not sufficient forces to do so. Thereupon\r\nthey gained fresh resolution and courage, and united with the people\r\nof Bwayan on the river, and equipped a number of caracoas and other\r\ncraft, in order to descend upon the coast of Pintados (Bisayas)\r\nto plunder them and make captives. The people of Tampakan, who\r\nlost hope of receiving further help from the Spaniards, and of the\r\nlatter's return to the river, since they had also abandoned the fort\r\nof La Caldera and left the country, came to terms with and joined\r\nthe people of Bwayan, their neighbors, in order to avoid the war and\r\ninjuries that they were suffering from the latter. Then all turned\r\ntheir arms against the Spaniards, promising themselves to make many\r\nincursions into their territory and gain much plunder. Accordingly\r\nthey prepared their fleet and appointed as leaders and commanders of\r\nit two of the experienced chiefs of the river of Mindanao, called\r\nSali and Silungan. [238] They left the Mindanao River in the month\r\nof July of the year 1599, in the season of the vendabals, [239]\r\nwith 50 caracoas, containing more than 3,000 soldiers armed with\r\narquebuses, kampilan, carasas, [240] other weapons with handles, and\r\nmany culverins, and steered toward the islands of Oton and Panay, and\r\nneighboring islands. They passed Negros Island and went to the river\r\nof Panay, which they ascended for 5 leagues to the chief settlement,\r\nwhere the alcalde-mayor and some Spaniards were living. They sacked\r\nthe settlement, burned the houses and churches, captured many native\r\nChristians--men, women, and children--upon whom they committed many\r\nmurders, cruelties, and outrages. They pursued these in boats more\r\nthan 10 leagues up the river, and destroyed all the crops. For the\r\nalcalde-mayor, and those who could, fled inland among the mountains,\r\nand accordingly the enemy had a better opportunity to do what they\r\npleased. After they had burned all the vessels in the river, they\r\nleft the river of Panay with their boats laden with pillaged goods\r\nand captive Christians. They did the same in the other islands and\r\ntowns which they passed. Then they returned to Mindanao, without\r\nany opposition being offered, with a quantity of gold and goods and\r\nmore than 800 captives, besides the people whom they had killed. In\r\nMindanao they divided the spoil, and agreed to get ready a larger\r\nfleet for the next year, and return to make war better prepared. [241]\r\n\r\nThis daring attack of the Mindanaos worked great injury to the Pintado\r\nIslands [Bisayas], both on account of their deeds there and also on\r\naccount of the fear and terror with which they inspired the natives;\r\nbecause of the latter being in the power of the Spaniards, who kept\r\nthem subject, tributary, and disarmed, and neither protected them from\r\ntheir enemies, nor left them the means to defend themselves, as they\r\nused to do when there were no Spaniards in the country. Therefore many\r\ntowns of peaceful and subjected Indians revolted and withdrew to the\r\ntingues, [242] and refused to descend to their houses, magistrates,\r\nand encomenderos. [243] As was reported daily, they all had a great\r\ndesire to revolt and rebel, but they were appeased and reduced\r\nagain to subjection by a few promises and presents from their\r\nencomenderos and religious who showed great pity and sadness over\r\ntheir injuries. Although in Manila people regretted these injuries,\r\nand still more those which were expected in the future from the enemy,\r\nthey did nothing but regret them--since the governor was ill provided\r\nwith ships and other necessities for the defense--and reckon them\r\nwith the loss which they had suffered for having raised the camp on\r\nthe river of Mindanao and dismantled the presidio of La Caldera.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the weather permitted, the Mindanaos and Sulus returned\r\nwith a large fleet of more than 70 well-equipped ships and more than\r\n4,000 fighting men, led by the same Silungan and Sali, and other\r\nMindanao and Sulu chiefs, to the same Islands of Pintados [Bisayas],\r\nwith the determination of taking and sacking the Spanish town of\r\nArévalo, which is situated in Oton. Capt. Juan García de Sierra,\r\nalcalde mayor of that province, having heard of this expedition and\r\nof the designs entertained by the enemy, took the most necessary\r\nprecautions, and gathering into the town all the Spaniards who\r\nlived there and in its neighborhood, shut himself up in it with\r\nall of them. Then, having repaired, as well as possible, a wooden\r\nfort there, he gathered there the women and their possessions. He\r\nand the Spaniards--about 70 men--armed with arquebuses, awaited the\r\nenemy. The latter, who intended to attack the river of Panay again,\r\npassed Negros Island and made for the town of Arévalo, where they\r\nanchored close to the native settlement. Then they landed 1,500 men\r\narmed with arquebuses, kampilan, and carasas, and, without stopping\r\non the way marched against the Spanish town which was the object of\r\ntheir attack. The Spaniards, divided into troops, sallied forth and\r\nopened fire with their arquebuses upon the enemy with such vehemence\r\nthat they forced them to retreat and take refuge on board their\r\ncaracoas. So great was the enemy's confusion that many Mindanaos\r\nwere killed before they could embark. Capt. Juan García de Sierra,\r\nwho was on horseback, pursued the enemy so closely to the water's edge\r\nthat the latter cut off the legs of his mount with their kampilan and\r\nbrought him to the ground, where they killed him. The enemy embarked\r\nwith a heavy loss of men, and halted at the Island of Gimarás, [244]\r\nin sight of Arévalo. There they counted their men, including the dead\r\nand the wounded, who were not a few, and among whom was one of the\r\nmost noted chiefs and leaders. Then they sailed for Mindanao, making\r\na great show of grief and sorrow, and sounding their bells [245]\r\nand tifas. [246] They made no further delay at Pintados [Bisayas],\r\nderiving little profit or gain from the expedition but much injury,\r\nand loss of men and reputation, which was felt more deeply upon their\r\narrival in Sulu and Mindanao. In order to remedy this disaster, it\r\nwas proposed to renew their expedition against the Pintados at the\r\nfirst monsoon with more ships and men, and it was so decided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX IV\r\n\r\nGALLINATO'S EXPEDITION TO JOLO\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas, Dr. Antonio de Morga, Mexico,\r\n1609.] [247]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe daring and audacity of the Mindanaos and Sulus in making incursions\r\nwith their fleets into the Islands of Pintados [Bisayas] had reached\r\nsuch a state that it was now expected that they would come as far as\r\nManila, plundering and devastating. In order to check them, at the\r\nbeginning of the year 1602, Governor Don Francisco Tello, deriving\r\nstrength from weakness, determined that the expedition against Sulu\r\nshould be made at once, without more delay, in order to punish and\r\npacify it, with the forces and men whom Capt. and Sargento-mayor\r\nJuan Xuarez Gallinato held in Cebu and in the Pintados [Bisayas]\r\ntogether with more men, ships, and provisions, which were sent him,\r\naccompanied by the necessary documents and instructions for him\r\nto enter the island, chastise its king and inhabitants, and pacify\r\nand reduce it to the obedience of his Majesty. By this means, until\r\nthere should be an opportunity to settle the affairs of Mindanao,\r\nwhich is quite near Sulu, the audacity of the enemy would be checked;\r\nand by bringing the war into his own country, he would not come out\r\nto commit depredations. Captain Gallinato set out on this expedition\r\nwith 200 Spanish soldiers, ships, artillery, enough provisions for four\r\nmonths--the time which it was thought the expedition would last--and\r\nwith Indians as rowers for the ships and for other services that might\r\narise. When he arrived at Sulu, at the bar of the river of this island,\r\nwhich is 2 leagues from the principal town and dwellings of the king,\r\nhe landed his men, artillery, and the necessary provisions and left\r\nhis ships under a sufficient guard. The islanders were all in the town\r\nand dwellings of the king, which are situated on a very high hill above\r\nsome cliffs, and have two roads of approach through paths and roads so\r\nnarrow that they can be reached only in single file. They had fortified\r\nthe whole place, intrenched it with palms and other woods and a number\r\nof culverins. They had also collected provisions and water for their\r\nsustenance, besides a supply of arquebuses and other weapons. They\r\nhad neither women nor children with them, for they had taken them out\r\nof the island. They had requested aid from the people of Mindanao,\r\nBruney, and Ternate, and were awaiting the same, since they had been\r\ninformed of the fleet which was being prepared against them in the\r\nPintados [Bisayas]. Gallinato determined to pitch his camp near the\r\ntown before this aid should arrive, and to attack the fort. After he\r\nhad quartered himself at a distance of one-half league, in a plain\r\nfacing the ascent, he sent interpreters with messages to the king and\r\nchiefs of the island, calling on them to surrender, and telling them\r\nthat good terms would be given them. While waiting for an answer,\r\nhe fortified his quarters in that spot, intrenching himself wherever\r\nnecessary. He mounted the artillery in the best position for use,\r\nand kept his men ready for any emergency. A false and deceptive answer\r\nwas returned, making excuses for the excesses that had been committed,\r\nand for not complying just then with what had been asked of them, and\r\nmaking loud promises to do so later. All this was with the object of\r\ndetaining the captain in that place, which is very unhealthy, until the\r\nrains should set in, his provisions run short, and the arrival of the\r\nexpected aid. After this answer had been received the Sulus, thinking\r\nthat the Spaniards had become more careless on account of it, swarmed\r\ndown quickly from the said fort in a large body of probably somewhat\r\nover one thousand; and armed with arquebuses and other weapons with\r\nhandles, kampilan, and caraças, attacked and assaulted the quarters\r\nand camp of the Spaniards. This could not be done so secretly as not\r\nto be seen by the Spaniards and allow them opportunity to prepare\r\nto receive the Sulus before their arrival. This the Spaniards did,\r\nand having permitted the natives to come all together in a body to\r\nthe very inside of the quarters and trenches, as soon as the Sulus\r\nhad discharged their arquebuses the Spaniards opened fire upon them,\r\nfirst with their artillery, and then with their arquebuses, killing\r\nmany, and forcing the rest to retire in flight to the fort. The\r\nSpaniards pursued them, wounding and killing to the middle of the\r\nhill. But seeing that farther on the paths were so narrow and rough,\r\nthey retreated before the heavy artillery fire from the heights\r\nand the large stones hurled down upon them and returned to their\r\nquarters. Upon many other days efforts were made to reach the fort,\r\nbut without any result. Thereupon Gallinato, in consideration of the\r\nwar being prolonged beyond what had been expected, built two forts,\r\none where he kept his ships in order to defend them and the port;\r\nand the other one-half league farther on in a suitable place where\r\nthey could take refuge and communicate with the camp. The forts were\r\nbuilt of wood and fascines and fortified with the artillery from the\r\nships. The Spaniards shut themselves up in these forts, whence from\r\ntime to time they sallied, making incursions as far as the enemy's\r\nfort. The latter always remained shut up in their fort without ever\r\nchoosing to come down or to yield; for he was convinced that the\r\nSpaniards could not remain long in the island. When Gallinato saw that\r\nthe rains were fast setting in, that his men were becoming ill, and\r\nthat his provisions were failing without his having accomplished the\r\ndesired task, and that it could not be accomplished with his remaining\r\nresources, and that the enemy from Mindanao with other allies of theirs\r\nwere boasting that they were gathering a large fleet in order to drive\r\nthe Spaniards from Jolo, he sent news of all that had occurred to the\r\ngovernor of Manila, with a plan of the island and fort and a relation\r\nof the difficulties which the enterprise presented. He sent this in a\r\nvessel, by Capt. and Sargento-mayor Pedro Cotelo de Morales, toward the\r\nend of May of the year 1602, in order to obtain instructions as to his\r\nprocedure, and the necessary reënforcement of men and provisions. The\r\ncaptain was charged to return quickly with the answer. * * *\r\n\r\nAt the same time that Governor Don Pedro de Acuña entered upon\r\nhis administration, the captain and sargento-mayor, Pedro Cotelo\r\nde Morales, arrived from Jolo with the advices and report of Juan\r\nXuarez Gallinato concerning the state of affairs in that island,\r\nwhither he had gone with the fleet at the beginning of that same\r\nyear. The governor, on account of the importance of the matter,\r\nwished to make every effort possible, and determined to send him\r\nsupplies and a reënforcement of some men, which he did as soon as\r\npossible. He was ordered to at least make an effort to punish that\r\nenemy, even if he could do nothing more, and whenever the opportunity\r\npresented itself, to go to do the same thing in the river of Mindanao,\r\nand return to the Pintados [Bisayas]. When this commission reached\r\nJolo Gallinato was already so worn out, and his men so ill, that the\r\nreënforcements only made it possible for him to get away from there;\r\naccordingly without seeing to another thing, he broke camp, burned the\r\nforts which he had built, embarked, and went to Pintados, leaving the\r\npeople of that Island of Sulu and their neighbors, those of Mindanao,\r\nemboldened more than ever to make raids against the Pintados, and\r\nthe islands within, which they did.\r\n\r\nThe governor, without delaying any longer in Manila, hastily started\r\nfor the Island of Panay and the town of Arévalo, in a galliot and\r\nother small vessels, to see their needs with his own eyes, in order to\r\nprovide for them. He left war matters in Manila, during his absence, in\r\ncharge of Licentiate Don Antonio de Ribera, auditor of the Audiencia.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the governor left Manila, the auditor had plenty to look\r\nafter, because a squadron of 20 caracoas and other vessels from\r\nMindanao entered the islands as far as the Island of Luzon and its\r\ncoasts, making captures. Having taken some ships bound from Cebu\r\nto Manila, they captured 10 Spaniards in them, among them a woman\r\nand a priest and Capt. Martin de Mandia, and they took them off with\r\nthem. They entered Calilaya, burned the church and all the town, and\r\ncaptured many persons of all classes among the natives. Thence they\r\npassed to the town of Balayan to do the same, but the auditor, having\r\nreceived news of the enemy in Manila, had it already in a state of\r\ndefense with 50 Spaniards and a captain and some vessels. Consequently,\r\nthey did not dare to enter the town or its bay, but crossed over\r\nto Mindoro, where, in the principal town, they captured many men,\r\nwomen, and children among the natives, seizing their gold and\r\npossessions, and burning their houses and church, where they captured\r\nthe prebendary Corral, curate of that doctrina. They filled their\r\nown ships, and others which they seized there, with captives, gold,\r\nand property, staying in the port of Mindoro as leisurely as though\r\nin their own land, notwithstanding that it is but 24 leagues from\r\nManila. Capt. Martin de Mendia, prisoner of these pirates, offered,\r\nfor himself and the other Spanish captives that, if they would let\r\nhim go to Manila, he would get the ransom for all, and would take\r\nit, or would send it within six months, to the river of Mindanao,\r\nor otherwise he would return to their power. The chief in command of\r\nthe fleet agreed thereto, with certain provisions and conditions,\r\nand caused the other captives to write to the effect that what had\r\nbeen agreed upon might be fulfilled, and then he allowed the captain\r\nto leave the fleet. The latter came to the city, and upon receiving his\r\nreport, the auditor sent munitions, ships, and more men to Balayan than\r\nthere were there already, with orders to go in pursuit of the enemy\r\nwithout delay, saying that they would find him in Mindoro. Capt. Gaspar\r\nPerez, who had charge of this in Balayan, did not start so quickly as\r\nhe should have done in order to find the enemy in Mindoro, for when\r\nhe arrived he found that he had left that port six days before, laden\r\nwith ships and booty, to return to Mindanao. Then he went in pursuit\r\nof him, although somewhat slowly. The enemy put into the river of a\r\nlittle uninhabited island to get water and wood. Just at that time\r\nGovernor Don Pedro de Acuña, who was hastily returning to Manila,\r\nfrom the town of Arevalo, where he had learned of the incursion of\r\nthose pirates, passed. He passed so near the mouth of the river, in\r\ntwo small champanes [248] and a virrey, [248] with very few men, that\r\nit was a wonder that he was not seen and captured by the enemy. He\r\nlearned that the enemy was there, from a boat of natives which was\r\nescaping therefrom, and then he met Gaspar Perez going in search of\r\nthe enemy with twelve vessels--caracoas and virreys and some large\r\nchampanes. The governor made him make more haste and gave him some\r\nof his own men to guide him to where he had left the pirates the day\r\nbefore, whereupon they went to attack them. But the latter espied\r\nthe fleet through their sentinels whom they had already stationed in\r\nthe sea, outside the river. Accordingly they left the river in haste,\r\nand took to flight, throwing into the sea goods and slaves in order\r\nto flee more lightly. Their flagship and almiranta caracoas protected\r\nthe ships which were dropping behind and made them throw overboard what\r\nthey could and work with all the strength of their paddles, assisted by\r\ntheir sails. The Spanish fleet, the vessels of which were not so light,\r\ncould not put forth enough strength to overtake all of them, because,\r\nfurthermore, they went into the open without fear of the heavy seas\r\nwhich were running, inasmuch as they were fleeing. Yet some of the\r\nships of Capt. Gaspar Perez, being lighter, got the enemy's fleet,\r\nsunk some caracoas, and captured two, but the rest escaped, although\r\nwith great danger of being lost. Without accomplishing anything else,\r\nthe fleet returned to Manila where the governor had already entered,\r\nvery much disturbed that things should have come to such a pass that\r\nthese enemies, who had never dared to leave their houses, should have\r\nbeen so daring and bold as to come to the very gates of the city,\r\ndoing great damage and making captures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX V\r\n\r\nOLASO'S EXPEDITION IN 1629 [249]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Relation of events in the Philippine Islands and other surrounding\r\nregions, from the month of July, 1629, until that of 1630.] [250]\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall commence the affairs of these islands with the expedition to\r\nJolo. It is an island of the Archipelago, rebellious for years past,\r\nand its natives, who are Mohammedans, have made a thousand incursions\r\nagainst us in these islands, pillaging whenever opportunity arises,\r\nburning villages and churches, and capturing numerous people.\r\n\r\nIn order to remedy all these evils, Governor Don Juan Niño de Tabora\r\ndetermined to equip a powerful fleet in order to destroy that enemy and\r\nconquer a stronghold which nature has made in their island so lofty\r\nand so difficult of approach that there is no better stone castle,\r\nfor the approach to it is by one path, and it has some artillery\r\nwhich defends it. The people are courageous and warlike. For our\r\nfleet were collected 1 galley, 3 brigantines, 12 freight champanes\r\n(which are like small pataches) [251] and about 50 caracoas. The last\r\nnamed are the usual craft of these islands, and generally have thirty\r\nor forty oars on a side. All these vessels together carried about 400\r\nSpaniards and 2,500 Indians, and they had considerable apparatus and\r\nwar supplies. It was quite sufficient for another conquest of greater\r\nimportance than the one on which they were going.\r\n\r\nAll that fleet departed, then, from the port of Dapitan on March\r\n17. Dapitan is the port nearest to the enemy, and the Island of Sulu\r\nwas reached in [blank space in the Ventura del Arco MS.] days. At\r\ndawn our men were landed, and began the ascent to the stronghold. The\r\nmaster-of-camp, Don Lorenzo de Olaso, who was commander in chief\r\nof the fleet, preceded the men. The Sulus defended their stronghold\r\nwith valor. They killed some of our men and wounded eight, among them\r\nthe master-of-camp himself. He was overthrown, as if dead, and went\r\nrolling down the hill. However, he was not dead, but only wounded,\r\nnothing more. Our men retired on the run, and to speak plainly, such\r\nterror entered into them that they did not dare to attack again. They\r\nskirted the island in their craft, entered the villages, burned,\r\nwrecked, destroyed them, and killed a few people. They brought back\r\nsome captives with them whom the Sulus had taken from us. A violent\r\nstorm overtook them, which compelled them to weigh anchor, and they\r\nretired stealthily. Thus so powerful a fleet as that was lost. It was\r\nsuch a fleet that never has one like it been made for the Indies in\r\nthese islands. The Sulu enemy were left triumphant, and so insolent\r\nthat we fear that they will make an end of the Islands of the Pintados\r\n[Bisayas] which are the nearest ones to them, and which they infest\r\nand pillage with great facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX VI\r\n\r\nCORCUERA'S CAMPAIGN IN JOLO [252]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my last letter I wrote to your Reverence of the result of the first\r\nattack, which was unfortunate, because the Moros repulsed us, as I told\r\nyour Reverence. Not less unfortunate will be the news that I shall\r\nnow relate, [253] which it is yet necessary for me to tell, in order\r\nto fulfil my duty and to remove the clouds arising from rumors and\r\nletters that will go there. I am here and see everything; and there is\r\nnever a lack of those who tell many new things and exaggerate matters\r\nthat are not so great as they will relate and descant there, where\r\nno one can report and declare what has happened. It is as follows:\r\n\r\nSince that attack, we have made two others. The first was with five\r\nmines which we had made, with which we expected to blow up a great\r\npart of those walls. All of the mines were fired, and thinking that\r\nthey would cause the same effects as the others our men retired\r\nfarther than they ought to have done. Four of the mines exploded,\r\nand did not a little damage among the enemy. They, full of fear,\r\nfled down from their position; but, as the mines did not make the\r\nnoise that we expected, we did not, accordingly, get there in time,\r\nas we were quite distant because of our fear lest the mines do us\r\nharm. The Moros retook their position, so that we were repulsed this\r\ntime, as we had been the other, with the death of a captain, while some\r\nmen were wounded. The fifth mine was left, and did not explode that\r\ntime. Hence its mouth was looked for, and having found it, we tried\r\ntwo days after that to make another assault. The assault was made after\r\nthe mine had exploded. That mine was larger than the others had been,\r\nand caused much damage. But the Moros fortified themselves again,\r\nwith greater strength than they had the last two times, and defended\r\nthemselves in their trenches, which had been fortified with many\r\nstockades and terrepleins, so that we could not enter. We lost some\r\nsoldiers on that occasion, who tried to show that they were bold and\r\nvaliant. Among them was the sargento-mayor, Melon, who was struck by\r\na ball which passed through him and carried him off in two days. May\r\nGod rest his soul! Thereupon, we retired to our posts and endeavored\r\nto collect our men and carry away the wounded, who were many. We\r\nhave lost four captains of renown in these three assaults--namely,\r\nCaptain Pimienta, Captain Juan Nicolas, Captain Don Pedro de Mena, and\r\nSargento-mayor Gonzales de Caseres Melon. Besides these three assaults,\r\nanother misfortune happened to us on St. Matthew's day, which was as\r\nfollows: Captain Rafael Ome, going with forty-six men and two hundred\r\nIndians to make a garo [254] (as we say here), and having taken up\r\nquarters in a field, where there was a fortified house, arranged\r\nhis posts at intervals and ordered his men to be on their guard. But\r\nsince man proposes and God disposes, the posts were either careless,\r\nor God ordained it thus; for suddenly the enemy rushed upon our men,\r\nwho could not unite, as they were by that time scattered through the\r\nforest. The enemy, having caught them off their guard, made a pastime\r\nof it, killing twenty-six men, and carrying off arms, powder, balls and\r\nfuses. I regard that event as the greatest of all our losses. Among\r\nthose of our men killed there by the enemy was Captain Lopez Suarez,\r\na fine soldier. Our men were not disheartened by these reverses,\r\nexcept such and such men. The governor well sustains the undertaking\r\nwith [all his powers of] mind and body. He has surrounded the entire\r\nhill with a stockade and a ditch, and has sown the ground with sharp\r\nstakes so that the enemy may neither receive aid nor sally out from\r\nit. At intervals there are sentry-posts and towers, so close that they\r\nalmost touch. There were six barracks along it, so that if any tower\r\nshould be in need the soldiers in them could go to its defense. Some\r\nof them have six men, others four, and those which have least three\r\nmen, as a guard. The enclosure is one league long and surrounds the\r\nhill. I do not know which causes the more wonder, the fort of the\r\nMoros or the enclosure of the Spaniards which restrains the Moros,\r\nso that they issue but seldom, and then at their peril. We are day\r\nby day making gradual advances. Today a rampart was completed which\r\nis just even with their stockades, so that we shall command the hill\r\nequally [with the enemy]. God helping, I hope that we shall reduce\r\ntheir trenches, and then we shall advance from better to better. May\r\nGod aid us; and si Dominus a custodierit civitatem frustra vigilat qui\r\ncustodit eam. [255] Father, prayers and many of them are needed. Will\r\nyour Reverence have them said in your holy college, and excuse me and\r\nall of us for what we can not do. I forward this letter, [hoping] for\r\nits good fortune in the holy sacrifices of your Reverence, etc. Jolo,\r\nMarch 31, 1638. To the father-prior of Manila.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAX CHRISTI, ETC.\r\n\r\nI would like to be the bearer of this letter, and to fulfil my desires\r\nof seeing your Reverence and all the fathers and brothers of your\r\nReverence's holy college. That is a proposition for which credit\r\nmay be given me, but the time gives space only to suffer; and thus\r\ndo we have to accommodate ourselves to it, and to check our desires,\r\ndrawing strength from weakness. I must content myself with writing,\r\nwhich would be a pleasant task, if I could do it at my leisure, and not\r\nso hastily as I have made known in certain letters that I have sent\r\nto your Reverence--not losing or neglecting any occasion at which I\r\ncould write. And so that this opportunity should not pass without a\r\nletter from me, I have hastened my pen beyond my usual custom, and\r\nhave written very concisely and briefly--although I could write at\r\ngreater length, and give account of many things which I leave for a\r\nbetter occasion. That will be when it is the Lord's pleasure for us\r\nto see each other. Moreover, I have no pleasant news to write, since\r\nthat which I could write would all be to the effect that we have not\r\ngained this enchanted hill; and that, at the times when we have tempted\r\nfortune, we have retired with loss of some men and many wounded.\r\n\r\nContinuing, then, in the same style as the last letter, I declare\r\nthat since the first assault, in which we were driven back with the\r\nloss of Captain Don Pedro Mena Pando, Adjutant Oliva, and Alférez\r\nTrigita, we have made two other assaults. One was on the twenty-fourth\r\nof March, the eve of our Lady of the Assumption. The second was on\r\nthe twenty-eighth of the same month. In the first, we trusted to the\r\nmines that had been made, by means of which we expected to make a safe\r\nentrance. We would have made it had our fear of receiving harm from\r\nthem matched the little fear of the enemy--who, as barbarians, did not\r\nprepare for flight, although they knew our designs. Of the five mines,\r\nfour blew up; and as was seen, and as we afterward learned here from\r\nsome captives, there was a great loss to the enemy. As soon as they\r\nsaw the fire, they took to flight; but our men, being at a distance,\r\ncould not come up to seize the posts that the enemy abandoned,\r\nuntil very late. That gave the Moros time to take precautions, so\r\nthat when we had come up, it was impossible to gain a single thing\r\nwhich the mines had given us. On that occasion both sides fought very\r\nvaliantly. The wounded on our side were not many, and our dead even\r\nfewer; among the later was Captain Pimienta. We were forced to return\r\nto our posts without having gained more than the damage wrought by\r\nthe mines. The loss of those people was considerable, while not few\r\nof them perished because of the severity of our fire. But with the\r\nopportunity of the fifth mine which remained (which could not have\r\nits effect, because the fire-channel of the others choked it), the\r\nthird attack was made inside of two days, by first setting fire to\r\nthat mine, and by arranging the men better than on the day of the\r\nprevious assault. They were set in array by the governor, who in\r\nperson came up to these quarters on that occasion. They set fire to\r\nthe mine, and more was accomplished than on the preceding days. Many\r\nof the enemy were killed; but, as the entrance was so deeply recessed,\r\nit could not be forced so freely by us, for the Moros were able to\r\ndefend it from us, with so great valor that we could not take it. Our\r\nmen fought with so great spirit and courage that it was necessary for\r\nthe leaders to use force with them in order to get the men to retire,\r\nwhen they saw the so superior force of the enemy. On that occasion\r\nthey killed seven of our men, besides wounding many. Among the latter\r\nwas Sargento-mayor Melon, who was shot through the lung by a ball. He\r\ndied on the second day, to the grief of all this army. Thereupon his\r\nLordship made his men retire to their quarters, and commanded that the\r\nfort should not be attacked, but that they should proceed to gain it by\r\nthe complete blockade of the enemy, as we are doing. By this method,\r\nI think that we shall make an entrance into the fort. Already we\r\nhave one bulwark, which we have made level with their entrenchments;\r\nand we are raising our works one and one-half varas [256] above them,\r\nso that we are dislodging them with our artillery. They are retiring\r\nto the interior of their fort. By this means we hope to gain entrance\r\ninto all their forts; and, once masters of them, I trust by God's\r\nhelp that we shall conquer their stronghold, and that they will humble\r\nthemselves to obey God and the king.\r\n\r\nBefore those assaults, on St. Matthew's day, Captain Raphael Ome went\r\nout to make a garo, as they say here, and to overrun the country. In\r\nthis island the level country is heavily wooded as nearly all of it is\r\nmountainous. He took in his company about fifty men (i.e., Spaniards)\r\nand two hundred Karaga Indians. The captain reached a field, and having\r\nlodged in a fortified house, such as nearly all those houses are\r\n(for those Indians of the mountain, who are called Guimennos, [257]\r\nbuild them for their defense), he placed his sentries and seized the\r\npositions that he judged most dangerous. But since non est volentis\r\nneque currentis, etc., either because of the great multitude and the\r\nwiliness of the enemy, or (as is more certain) because the sentries\r\nwere careless, and the other men asleep, the enemy came suddenly and\r\nattacked our soldiers--with so great fury that they killed twenty-six\r\nmen, among whom was Captain Lopez Suarez, a brave soldier. The leader\r\nand captain, Ome, was in great danger. He fought in person with so\r\ngreat valor that, although run through with a spear, he attacked and\r\ndefeated his opponent, laying him dead at his feet. Few of our men\r\naided him, and many of them retreated immediately, thus allowing\r\nthe enemy to capture from us twenty firearms, with fuses, powder,\r\nand balls. That was a great loss, and it is certain that we have not\r\nhitherto had a greater. And if any loss has occurred, it has been\r\ndue to the neglect and confidence of the Spaniard.\r\n\r\nToday two Basilan Indians came down from the hill to ask for mercy,\r\nand for passage to their own country. They say that they are sent by\r\nthe datus in the stronghold who came from that island of Basilan or\r\nTagima; and that, if permission and pardon were given to them by the\r\npari [i.e., Corcuera], one hundred and thirty of them would come down\r\nin the morning. We regard this as a trick of that Moro; and, although\r\nit may be as they say, we are taking precautions, and are watching for\r\nwhatever may happen. If they should come, they will be well received;\r\nand that will not be a bad beginning to induce others to come from\r\nthe hill. I shall advise your Reverence of such event on the first\r\noccasion. What we know that they are suffering within [the fort] is\r\nthe disease of smallpox and discharges of blood, together with great\r\nfamine; because we have surrounded the entire hill with ditches and\r\nstockades, set with sharp stakes, which run around it for more than\r\none and one-half leagues, and within musket-shot [of their fort] is a\r\nsentry-post [garita] or tower in which three men and three Bantayas\r\nare staying. By that means the enemy cannot enter or go out without\r\nbeing seen; and, when they do that, they are given such a bombardment\r\nthat scarcely does any one dare to go outside of their walls. The\r\nhill is a beautiful sight, and if it were enjoying holy peace instead\r\nof war, it would be no small matter of entertainment and recreation\r\nto survey the landscape at times. The Moro does not like to see us,\r\nand is looking at us continually from his stronghold and yelling and\r\nscoffing at us--as they say sometimes that the Spaniards are chickens;\r\nagain, that they are sibabuyes, [258] and again, that they will come\r\nto set fire to us all, and kill us. The Moro is a great rascal and\r\nbuffoon. I trust in God that in a little while He will be ready for\r\nour thanksgivings [for the defeat of the Moros]. Will your Reverence\r\nurge His servants to aid us with their sacrifices and prayers. Those,\r\nI believe, it will be that must give us the victory, and that must\r\nhumble the arrogance of this Mohammedan. His Lordship is displaying\r\ngreat firmness and patience, as he is so great a soldier. Already has\r\nhe almost raised a stone fort on the beach, for he intends to leave\r\na presidio here, and I think that it will be almost finished before\r\nhe leaves. Nothing else occurs to me. Of whatever else may happen,\r\nyour Reverence will be advised on the first occasion. If I have gone\r\nto considerable length in this letter, it is because I have known,\r\none day ahead, of the departure of this champan. I commend myself\r\nmany times to the holy sacrifices of your Reverence. This letter\r\nwill also serve for our father provincial, etc. Jolo, April 5, one\r\nthousand six hundred and thirty-eight.\r\n\r\nThe Moro has returned today with a letter from the queen and all the\r\nstronghold, in which they beg pardon and humiliate themselves. May\r\nGod grant it, and bring them to His knowledge. I shall advise you of\r\nthe result. I hear that Datu Ache is dead. If that is so, then the\r\nend has come. Today, the sixth of the above month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAX CHRISTI.\r\n\r\nDeo gratias qui dedit nobis victoriam per Jesum Christum Dominum\r\nnostrum. [259] I have written your Reverence another letter, by way of\r\nOton, telling you that it was our Lord's pleasure to give us a joyous\r\nEaster-tide, the beginning of what has happened. His Divine Majesty\r\nhas chosen to bestow upon us an overflowing blessing, by the reduction\r\nof these Moros so that they should come, abased and humiliated, to\r\nbeg His governor for mercy; for, whether it was the latter's plan\r\nto go to treat for peace at Basilan for their men, or whether they\r\nshould send them all, that they might see how the governor viewed their\r\npetition, the following day they came with letters from the queen [260]\r\nfor Father Pedro Gutierrez and his Lordship. Therein she begged the\r\nfather to protect her, for she wished to come to throw herself at the\r\nfeet of the hari of Manila, and to beg his pardon for the obstinacy\r\nthat they had shown hitherto. The father answered for his Lordship,\r\nin regard to the pardon, that if they agreed to do what was right,\r\nthey would be very gladly pardoned; but that in regard to their coming\r\nit was not time, until they would humbly give up the arms which they\r\nhad taken from us, and the captives, vessels, and holy ornaments;\r\nand that, even though the queen had so great authority, so long\r\nas the king did not come, he must declare and show his willingness\r\nto accept what the queen had written. Accordingly, the king wrote\r\nto the same father and to his Lordship next day, begging the same\r\nthing and more earnestly. But he was not allowed to come--which he\r\nurgently entreated--until they should have given up the arms and\r\nother things of which they robbed us. Difficulties arose over this\r\npoint, as to which of the two things was to be done first. The Moro\r\ndeclared that he wished to treat first of the peace, and the points\r\non which they were to agree; and therefore it was necessary to see\r\nthe hari of Manila first of all. But Don Sebastian, as he was so\r\nexperienced in these matters of war (in which God has inspired him\r\nwith so wise resolutions, and given him even better results) held firm\r\nto his proposals. Two days passed, but at last the king agreed to the\r\nterms, by giving up the pieces of artillery which he had captured from\r\nus. There were four iron pieces; and, in place of one which had burst,\r\none of bronze was requested, which many mines had buried. Afterward\r\nwe found the broken piece, by opening the mouth of one of the mines:\r\nand he gave it to us willingly--saying that he had thus brought the\r\nbroken piece, and that he ought not for that reason to give another in\r\nits place; and that which had been asked from him had been bought for\r\nforty basines of gold at Makassar. In order that the Spaniards might\r\nsee what an earnest desire for a permanent peace was in his heart,\r\nand that he was greatly inclined to it, he sent also some muskets,\r\nalthough few and poor ones. In what pertained to the captives, he\r\nsaid that he would surrender those that he had, but that he could not\r\npersuade his datus to give up theirs; still he would ask them to give\r\ntheir captives. At most, he sent eleven Christian captives, counting\r\nmen, women, and children. He had already spent the holy vessels, for,\r\nsince it was so long a time since they had been brought, he had sold\r\nthem to the king of Makassar; but he said that he and all his property\r\nwere there, to satisfy the Spaniards for any injury that they had\r\nreceived. The king petitioned his Lordship to allow him to visit him;\r\nand his Lordship granted such permission for Quasimodo Sunday.\r\n\r\nThe datus [sic] were very angry that the king was so liberal, and\r\nbecause he humbled himself so deeply; accordingly, they opposed his\r\nleaving the hill to talk with the governor. They tried to prevent it,\r\nbut the king overruled by the reasons which he gave to the datus, and\r\nwhich father Gregorio Belin gave to him. His Lordship gave hostages\r\nfor the king, and ordered Captain Marquez and Captain Raphael Ome to\r\nremain as such. They asked for Admiral Don Pedro de Almonte and two\r\nfathers, but that was not granted to them. Finally they were satisfied\r\nwith the two said captains, persons of great esteem and worth; and the\r\nking came down to talk with his Lordship, accompanied by many chief\r\nmen. His Lordship received him with such display as he could arrange at\r\nshort notice, under a canopy of damask, and seated on a velvet chair,\r\nwith a cushion of the same at his feet. Another cushion was placed\r\nat his side upon a rug. As the king entered the hall, his Lordship\r\nrose from his seat, and advancing two steps, embraced the Moro king;\r\nthen he made him sit down on the cushion that had been prepared. Then\r\nhis Lordship also seated himself beside the king in his chair, while\r\nat his right side was his confessor, and at his left stood a captain\r\nof the guard and the sargento-mayor. Grouped behind the confessor\r\nwere the fathers who were in the quarters on that occasion. There\r\nwere two Augustinian Recollects, and one Franciscan Recollect, and\r\na secular priest. Then came Father Gutierrez, and Father Gregorio\r\nBelin. The king requested permission to rest a little first, for he\r\ncame, one of his servants fanning him (haciendole paypay), lifting\r\nup from time to time the chinina which he wore--open in front,\r\nin order to catch the breeze, and to enable him to shelter himself\r\nfrom the heat, or to get rid of the fears with which he had come. His\r\nchief men seated themselves after him on that open floor, a seat very\r\nsuitable for such nobility, who esteemed it as a great favor. Then when\r\nthe king was rested, or reassured from his fears, they began their\r\ndiscourses or bicharas, talking, after the manner of these people,\r\nby the medium of interpreters--namely, Father Juan de Sant Joseph,\r\nan Augustinian Recollect, and Alférez Mathias de Marmolejo, both good\r\ninterpreters. The governor set forth his conditions. The agreement\r\nmade was: first, that the banners of the king, our sovereign, were\r\nto be hoisted on the stronghold; second, that the men from Basilan\r\nwere to be permitted to leave the stronghold and go to their country;\r\nthird, that the Macassars and Malays were also to leave and return to\r\ntheir own lands; and fourth, in order that the first condition might\r\nbe fulfilled without the rattle of arms and the shedding of blood,\r\nall the enemy were to come down to our quarters, while the king and\r\nqueen and their family could come to that of the governor. The Moro\r\nking did not like this last point; but, as he saw that matters were\r\nill disposed for his defense, he had to assent to everything. But,\r\nbefore its execution, he begged his Lordship to communicate the\r\nterms with his men and datus, saying that he would endeavor to get\r\nthem all to agree to the fulfilment of what his Lordship ordered;\r\nand that in a day and a half he would reply and, in what pertained\r\nto the other conditions, they would be immediately executed. This\r\nhappened, for the Basilans descended in two days with all their men\r\nand families--in all, one hundred and forty-seven. Some fifty or sixty\r\ndid not then descend, as they were unable to do so. The Macassars\r\nrefused to descend until they received pardon from his Lordship,\r\nand a passport to their own country. Therefore their captain came to\r\ntalk with his Lordship, who discussed with him what was to be done\r\nwith him and his men. The latter are very humble and compliant to\r\nwhatever his Lordship should order. His Lordship answered that he\r\nwould pardon their insolent and evil actions, and they could descend\r\nwith security of life; and that he would give them boats, so that they\r\ncould go away. Thereupon the captain, giving a kris as security that\r\nthey would come, returned, and immediately began to bring down his\r\nproperty and men. The Malays came with them, for all those peoples\r\nhad united against the Castilians. They are the ones who have done\r\nus most harm with their firearms, and have furnished quantities of\r\nammunition for all the firearms of the Sulus. At the end of the time\r\nassigned to the king for answering his Lordship in regard to the\r\nmatters which he had discussed with him, he was summoned, in order\r\nthat what had been recently concluded might not be hindered, as his\r\nLordship had many matters to which to attend. If he would not come,\r\nhis Lordship was resolved immediately to continue his bombardment\r\nand fortifications, saying that he would make slaves of all whom he\r\ncaptured. With this resolution, the queen determined to come to visit\r\nhis Lordship; and, so saying and doing, she summoned her chair, and\r\nhad herself carried down to the quarters of Don Pedro de Almonte,\r\nwhich is the one located on their hill, and which has given them\r\nso much to do. She sent a message to the governor, begging him to\r\ngrant her permission, as she wished to see him. His Lordship sent a\r\nmessage to her, to the effect that he would be very glad to see her,\r\nand that she would be coming at a seasonable time. She came to the\r\nhall borne on the shoulders of her men, accompanied by some of her\r\nladies and by her kasis, who was coming with pale face. She alighted\r\nat the door of his Lordship's hall. He went out to receive her,\r\nand with marked indications of friendship and kindness led her to\r\nher seat, which was a cushion of purple velvet; and his Lordship,\r\nseated in his own chair, welcomed her through his interpreter,\r\nAlférez Mathias de Marmolexo. She responded very courteously to the\r\ncourtesies of the governor; for the Moro woman is very intelligent,\r\nand of great capacity. She did not speak directly to the interpreters,\r\nbut through two of her men, one of whom was the kasis; and often he,\r\nwithout the queen speaking, answered to what was proposed. The queen\r\npetitioned and entreated the governor to desist from entering the\r\nstronghold, for the women, being timid creatures, feared the soldiers\r\ngreatly. And if his Lordship was doing it to oblige her and the king\r\nher husband to descend, she said that they would descend immediately,\r\nwith all their people. Thus did she entreat from him whom his Lordship\r\nrepresented; and I desired that she should obtain this favor. His\r\nLordship answered her that he would do so very willingly; but that he\r\nhad an express mandate for it [i.e., to gain the fort] from his king,\r\nand that, if he did not obey it, he would lose his head. \"I do not\r\nwish,\" said Tuan Baluka (for such is the name of the queen), \"that\r\nthe favor which I petition be at so great a price and danger to your\r\nLordship. Consequently, will you kindly grant me three days? and in\r\nthat time I, the king, and our people will descend without fail.\" His\r\nLordship thanked her anew, and added that with this she obliged him\r\nto fulfil strictly what he had promised her. \"Indeed,\" said the queen,\r\n\"I have no doubt of it; for, being in the gaze of so many nations that\r\nyour Lordship has to conquer, it is clear that you must fulfil what\r\nyou have promised me; for your Lordship's actions toward me would\r\nbe understood by all to be those that you would have to perform\r\ntoward all.\" This terminated the discussion. His Lordship ordered\r\na collation to be spread for the queen and her ladies; and then his\r\nLordship retired, so that they might refresh themselves without any\r\nembarrassment. Then, having dined, the queen returned to her stronghold\r\nwith the retinue that she had brought. Before she left the quarters\r\nshe was saluted by the discharge of two large pieces of artillery,\r\nwhich had been made ready for that purpose. She was greatly pleased\r\nby that, and the next day began to carry out her promises, by sending\r\ndown a portion of her possessions. The Makassars and Malays also\r\nbrought down their property with her, and immediately embarked. I\r\nhad written up to this point to this day, Saturday, the seventeenth\r\nof this month of April, hoping for the end of all these incipient\r\nresults and expected events regarding this stronghold; the issue has\r\nbeen such as we could expect from Him who has also been pleased to\r\narrange and bring it to pass. Last night the queen came down to sleep\r\nin our camp or quarters, with some of her ladies. In the morning she\r\nwent to report her good treatment to her people; for she was received\r\nwith a salute of musketry and large artillery, and a fine repast. All\r\nthat has been done to oblige her to encourage her people, for they\r\nwere very fearful, to descend immediately. More than two thousand\r\nhave now descended, and our banners are flying on the hill, and our\r\nmen are fortified on it. May God be praised, to whom be a thousand\r\nthanks given; for He, without our knowledge or our expectations, has\r\ndisposed this matter thus--blinding this Moro and disheartening him,\r\nso that, having been defeated, he should surrender to our governor, and\r\ngive himself up without more bloodshed. We are trying to secure Datu\r\nAche; if we succeed in this, I shall advise you. Now there is nothing\r\nmore to say, reverend Father, except to give God the thanks, for He\r\nis the one who has prepared and given this victory to us; and to beg\r\nall in your Reverence's holy college to give thanks that the college\r\nhas had (as I am very certain) so great a share in the achievements\r\n[here]. The governor is very much pleased and we all regard him in the\r\nproper light. The men are full of courage, and even what was carefully\r\ndone is now improved. I am the humble servant of your Reverence whom\r\nI pray that God may preserve as I desire, and to whose sacrifices I\r\nearnestly commend myself. Jolo, April 17, 1638.--Juan de Barrios.\r\n\r\nAll the Sulus descended, in number about four thousand six hundred,\r\nto the sea. Finding themselves down and outside the enclosure, they\r\nall fled, under cover of a very heavy shower of rain--leaving all\r\ntheir possessions, in order not to be hindered in their flight. Many\r\nmothers even abandoned their little children. One abandoned to us a\r\nlittle girl who had received a dagger-stroke, who received the waters\r\nof baptism and immediately died. There is much to say about this, and\r\nmany thanks to give to God, of which we shall speak when it pleases\r\nGod to let us see each other. Today, the nineteenth of this month of\r\nApril, 1638.--Barrios.\r\n\r\nThe governor sent messages to the king and queen by two kasis,\r\nasking why they had fled. They replied that since all their people\r\nhad fled, they had gone after them for very shame, but that they\r\nwould try to bring them back and to come, and this was the end of the\r\nmatter. The result was exceedingly profitable for our soldiers and\r\nIndians; for the Sulus, fearful because they thought that, if they\r\nbecame scattered, they would all be killed, abandoned whatever they\r\nwere carrying--quantities of goods, and chests of drawers--which our\r\nsoldiers sacked. Above, in the stronghold, they found much plunder. It\r\nis believed that the king and queen will return, but not Datu Ache;\r\nbut this is not considered certain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM SANBOANGAN [261]\r\n\r\nPAX CHRISTI\r\n\r\nI am not writing to anyone [else], for the lack of time does not allow\r\nme to do so. Therefore will your Reverence please communicate this to\r\nthe father provincial, Father Hernandez Perez, Father Juan de Bueras,\r\nand the father rector of Cavite.\r\n\r\nWhen our men were most disheartened at seeing that the fortress on\r\nthe hill was so extensive, and that it was becoming stronger daily;\r\nthat the mines and artillery had seemingly made no impression on it;\r\nthat we had been repulsed four times; and that our men were falling\r\nsick very rapidly: in order that it might be very evident that it\r\nwas [all] the work of God, ambassadors came from the hill to beg his\r\nLordship for mercy. He received them gladly, and asked them for the\r\nartillery that they had plundered from the Christians, etc. They\r\nbrought down four pieces, which they had taken from the shipyard,\r\nand brought to us some Christians. Next day, more than one hundred\r\nand fifty people from Basilan descended, who surrendered their arms,\r\nand then about fifty Makassars, who did the same; and all were embarked\r\nin the patache.\r\n\r\nNext day the king and queen went down and slept in the camp of Don\r\nSebastian. On the following day (which was the day agreed upon when\r\nall were to descend from the hill), seeing that it was already late,\r\nthe king and queen said that they would go to get their people. The\r\ngovernor granted them permission, and went to a camp that was located\r\nopposite the gate of the stronghold. All the Sulus descended, carrying\r\ntheir goods, arms, etc., to the number of about four hundred soldiers,\r\nand more than one thousand five hundred women, children, old men,\r\netc. They reached the governor's camp and Don Pedro de Francia told\r\nthe king that they must surrender their arms. The latter replied that\r\nhe would surrender them to none other than to the governor. Thereupon,\r\nthey went to summon his Lordship; but the Sulus, seeing that they were\r\ngoing to summon him, fled, under a heavy shower that was falling,\r\nand abandoned all their goods. A vast amount of riches, many pieces\r\nof artillery, and versos, [262] falcons, muskets, arquebuses, etc.,\r\nwere found. The cause of the Moros fleeing was their great fear that\r\nthey were to be killed. On our part, since Don Sebastian Hurtado held\r\nall their stronghold, and had left only thirty men in his quarters\r\n(in order that Datu Ache might not escape), and as that number could\r\nnot resist so many people, the Sulus were, on the contrary, allowed\r\nto go without any firearms being discharged.\r\n\r\nMore than two hundred and fifty of the Sulus have died, and they\r\nwere perishing in great numbers from dysentery because the women and\r\nchildren were placed under ground for fear of the balls. That and the\r\nfear of the mines caused their surrender; for it was impossible to\r\ntake their fort by assault. The interior strength of that stronghold\r\nis so great that the Spaniards were surprised; and all recognize\r\nthat it has been totally the work of God, and [a result of] the\r\nperseverance of Don Sebastian, who ever said that all must die or\r\ncapture the stronghold. Somewhat more than two hundred Christian and\r\nmore than one hundred Moro women have come from the stronghold during\r\nthis time. All the Moro women are fearful. Up to date eighty-three\r\nSpaniards have died from wounds, and many of them from disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE KILLED\r\n\r\n    Sargento-mayor Melon\r\n    Captain Don Pedro de Mena\r\n    Captain Don Juan Nicolas\r\n    Captain Don Pimienta\r\n    Captain Don Lope Suarez\r\n\r\n\r\n    DIED OF DYSENTERY\r\n\r\n    Captain Don Aregita Martin de Avila\r\n    Adjutant Oliba\r\n    Adjutant Calderon\r\n    Alférez Concha\r\n    Alférez Alonzo Gonzalez\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall not name others, as they are not so well known, and it will be\r\nknown later. Up to date about two hundred Bisayan Indians have died,\r\nmost of them from diseases. Don Pedro Cotoan died while en route from\r\nJolo to Samboanga, in order to take back the Bisayans, who are a most\r\ncowardly race. Those who have done deeds of valor are the Karagas,\r\nand the Sulus tremble at sight of them. Don Pedro Almonte remains as\r\ngovernor and lieutenant for the captain-general at Samboangan, with one\r\nhundred and fifty Spaniards, as has been reported. Captain Jines Ros is\r\nto stay as castellan in Jolo with one hundred and eighty men--Captain\r\nSarria being fortified in the stronghold with eighty men, and Jines\r\nRos on the beach in a stone tower that is already eight stones high,\r\nwith one hundred men. Captain Marquez is going to Buaren with fifty\r\nSpaniards, although no succor had been sent to Don Sebastian from\r\nManila. All that has been supplied to excess is truly wonderful,\r\nfor the winds have brought (and it is incredible) many champanes,\r\nwith more than twenty thousand baskets of rice, innumerable fowls,\r\nand pork, veal, beef, and cheeses from Cebu, which have made a very\r\nexcellent provision.\r\n\r\nThey ask for Father Martinez [and] Alexandro at Jolo [and] Father\r\nCarrion at Buiaon, but without an associate. I say that, following\r\neven to the end of the world, I do not know to what to compare these\r\nMoros of Samboangan. They have paid all their tributes. This is a brief\r\nrelation. I pray your Reverence to pardon me and commend me to God,\r\nfor indeed what I desire is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nSamboangan, April 23, 1638. [263]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX VII\r\n\r\nOBANDO'S REPORT ON THE PREPARATIONS TO BE UNDERTAKEN TO RETURN ALIMUD\r\nDIN TO SULU, JULY 15, 1751 [264]\r\n\r\n\r\nSire: Your Majesty will find in the enclosed report the resolutions\r\nadopted by the Committees of the War and Treasury Departments for\r\nthe purpose of reinstating the king of Sulu, Fernando the First,\r\nwhom I found in this capital, baptized and protected by Royal briefs\r\ninsuring him the continuation of the same Royal goodwill as long as\r\nhe remained a Christian and a friend of the nation, which seems to be\r\nhis intention hitherto, with the help of 3 galleys, 3 barges, 1 galiot,\r\n2 large champanes and other craft for war and transportation, under the\r\norders of the Master-of-camp of your Majesty's infantry here, to whom\r\nI have given the instructions and orders contained in said report,\r\nto the effect that he should make port at Zamboanga, and from there\r\ntry to subdue the rebel vassals, blockade the island of Sulu by sea,\r\ncut it off from all communication with its neighbors, prevent food from\r\nbeing introduced, prevent and punish all depredations, acts of piracy\r\nand insults on the part of that barbarous nation against the town and\r\nvassals of your Majesty of which I receive pitiful complaints every\r\nday, and see that the captives are returned and that due observance\r\nis given the treaties of peace and other agreements which were made\r\nby my predecessor but have not proved to be as satisfactory as might\r\nhave been hoped, on account of the inconstancy which characterizes\r\nthat nation.\r\n\r\nBefore undertaking such an important operation, I decided to order\r\nthe construction of three average sized galleys, and other small\r\nvessels, of which there were none in these Islands; and to arm them\r\nI ordered to be cast 100 perrier cannon of calibre 2, with three\r\nchambers each, ordering the transfer to the province of Iloilo of\r\nGeneral Francisco Domingo Oscoti, as Lieutenant-Intendant-General,\r\nwith instructions to prepare provisions at the smallest cost for the\r\nTreasury, and directing him to issue a proclamation (as he did) calling\r\nfor volunteers, who would be rewarded according to their merits on the\r\nships plying between Manila and Acapulco, and authorizing the natives\r\nto arm boats at their expense, exempting them of all taxes during\r\nthe expedition. As I was in possession of a rescript of your Majesty\r\naddressed to his Field Marshal my predecessor Gaspar de la Torre,\r\nordering him to reconnoiter the island of Balabak, and Ipolote Bay,\r\nand other places of Palawan Island for the purpose of building a fort\r\nfor the protection of the inhabitants against the people of Sulu,\r\nTiron and Borneo, and to build six galleys with which to fight the\r\nMoros, with a report on the same object presented by the Province\r\nof Saint Nicholas of these Islands, [265] both of which have been\r\ncommunicated to said Committees of the War and Treasury Departments\r\nand to persons who had knowledge by experience of the said province\r\nand regions; also, in view of the poor condition of the Royal treasury\r\nwhich precluded the possibility of greater expenses it was decided,\r\nin accordance with the opinion of your Majesty's Fiscal [Attorney\r\nGeneral] in regard to the above mentioned instruments, to incorporate\r\nthem to said report (or record), [266] as they are of the same nature,\r\nto take, when there was a better opportunity, the proper measures for\r\nreconnoitering the most favorable position for the intended fort,\r\nand to await the result of the expedition for the reinstatement\r\nof the king of Sulu, so as to request him, if the result should be\r\nfavorable, to withdraw his vassals from the fort of Ipolote, and,\r\nif not, to secure the safety of the people of the said island by\r\ndriving them out; and having already ordered, as I have said, the\r\nconstruction of the galleys, which were necessary and made more so\r\nby your Royal order, to continue the work until the six were built,\r\nsaid work being carried on with the utmost care and economy, which\r\nI always bear in mind in my zeal for the service of your Majesty.\r\n\r\nI will send your Majesty full reports on the progress of these\r\ndifferent undertakings, so that your Royal orders may let me know\r\nyour Royal pleasure, which will always meet with my humble obedience.\r\n\r\nGod give the Royal and Catholic Person of your Majesty the many years\r\nof life which are required by Christendom for the happiness of your\r\nvast dominions.\r\n\r\n\r\nManila, July 15, 1751.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX VIII\r\n\r\nOBANDO'S REPORT ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING THE ATTEMPT TO RETURN\r\nALIMUD DIN TO SULU, JUNE 18, 1752 [267]\r\n\r\n\r\nSire: In a letter addressed to your Majesty last year, 1751,\r\nI forwarded a report and vouchers to the effect that I had sent,\r\nwith the King of Sulu, Fernando the First, to the fortified station\r\nof Zamboanga, a fleet of 3 galleys, two feluccas, two galiots and two\r\nlarge champanes, with other craft, under the Master-of-camp [268] of\r\nthe Royal troops here, for the purpose of restoring said king to his\r\nthrone and forcing his rebel vassals to submit, by means of a blockade\r\nof the island of Sulu, which would cut it off from all communication\r\nwith its neighbors and prevent the importation of food to the island,\r\nother provisions being made for the purpose of protecting the Christian\r\ncommunities against any further harm on the part of the Sulu people\r\nand the Tirons. [269] I have the honor to report now that the said\r\nMaster-of-camp arrived at Zamboanga with most of the fleet, ahead of\r\nthe Sultan of Sulu, who had been delayed by various accidents, and\r\nsailed at once, in order to avoid the monsoon, for the Bay of Jolo,\r\nwhere he anchored on the 26th of June of that year, at about one mile\r\nfrom the forts. He formed a line of battle, and, noticing two Chinese\r\nchampanes without flags, that were stationed near the river mouth and\r\nwere stretching two lines to go up stream, he ordered two long-boats\r\nto go and remove them from under the artillery of the enemy; the Jolo\r\nforts, four in number, displayed red banners and opened fire with\r\ncannon of calibre 8 to 18 on the boats towing the champanes; our fleet\r\nanswered, and the fire was kept up some time on both sides, until the\r\nenemy hoisted the white flag in order to gain time for reënforcing his\r\ntrenches; the Master-of-camp sent a letter to Prince Asin, informing\r\nhim that his only purpose was to restore the legitimate king of Sulu\r\nto his dominions, and to have the captives delivered; the prince\r\nanswered that he had no captives to deliver; that he was waiting for\r\nthe return of the king, who would do as he wished with them, that he\r\nwas begging the Prophet to send back the king * * *. Finding such an\r\nanswer vain and impertinent, our ships opened fire again; a suburb\r\nwas stormed and burned, and our men found out that the negotiations\r\nwere a pretext to gain time to place artillery behind the palisades;\r\nthe Moros accomplished this purpose and again requested a truce in\r\norder to hold a meeting of their leaders and to deliberate as to\r\nwhat should be done. This was granted, and in a second letter signed\r\nby the Datus Prince Asin insisted that the Master-of-camp should\r\nretire to Zamboanga, promising to bring over the captives; as the\r\nsouth-west monsoon was blowing hard and he was short of provisions,\r\nthe latter decided to go back to Zamboanga; the Datus informed their\r\nking Fernando in a letter addressed to him at Zamboanga of what had\r\nbeen agreed; Prince Asin also stated verbally that he would bring to\r\nZamboanga some captives whom he was going to seek in the woods, and\r\nasked the Master to leave the port, while he went after the wives and\r\nchildren of the followers of King Fernando, who had been frightened and\r\nscattered by the artillery. After a few more answers and objections\r\nwhich showed an utter lack of sincerity, the Master-of-camp sailed\r\nback to Zamboanga. The King of Sulu had arrived there on June 22,\r\nand as soon as he heard about the truce requested by his brother\r\nAsin, and other affairs of the fleet, he declared that the prince\r\nwas his enemy. This statement was believed at the time, but soon\r\nafterwards good-sized boats began to arrive one after the other\r\nwith many of his principal people on the pretext of Prince Asin's\r\nvisit to the King, until there were 180 persons, including 32 women\r\nbetween concubines and servants. When the Master-of-camp, Governor\r\nof Zamboanga, remarked that all these boats were full of firearms,\r\npowder, ball, coats of mail, helmets, and other warlike equipment,\r\nthat the King of Sulu had secretly sent to his brother Asin, at\r\nBasilan, golden buckles and epaulets, and embroidered stockings to\r\nmake a brilliant appearance at landing in Zamboanga, while he feigned\r\nto be his enemy; that Prince Asin had failed to keep his word, since\r\nhe said that he had been unable to get hold of the captives he was to\r\nbring to Zamboanga, when it was known that he was keeping the said\r\ncaptives in a secret place, six of them, including a woman, having\r\nescaped by swimming over to the fleet when the latter was at Jolo,\r\nand reported that the Moros had many captives concealed in the woods;\r\nthat Prince Asin had written to the King that all the captives seized\r\nduring the latter's stay in Manila were still in their power, not\r\none having been sold while awaiting the royal commands; and finally,\r\nthat the King and his brother were secretly dismissing the concubines\r\nonly, telling them that the Master-of-camp was sending them away with\r\ncontumely; he inferred that the King was preparing to surprise the\r\nfort. This surmise was strengthened by the face that armed men were\r\nsteadily coming in each day, despite the Master-of-camp's friendly\r\nadmonition to the King that his followers enter the fort unarmed. The\r\nlying and disingenuousness of the King, which all these indications\r\nwere making plainer every moment, were finally betrayed by a letter,\r\nwritten in Arabic characters, to the King of Mindanao, in which he\r\nstated that he had been compelled, by those in whose power he was,\r\nto write the letter he had previously sent him from Manila,--whereas\r\nhe had enjoyed complete freedom in this capital, so complete, in\r\nfact, that he did not perform, during the voyage hence to Zamboanga,\r\na single rite of the Christian religion, as far as known, while he\r\nwas seen to perform various Moro religious acts, and took with him\r\nthe Quran in his own language, instead of the numerous Catholic\r\nbooks which had been given him for his instruction. In view of all\r\nthe foregoing evidence of bad faith, the Master-of-camp, Governor of\r\nZamboanga, and the captains of the fleet decided to arrest at the same\r\ntime the King, the datus and their men, to seize their boats, arms,\r\nand concealed ammunition, and to keep the whole under careful guard,\r\nthe men being detained in decent quarters, pending the decision of\r\nthe Captain-General.\r\n\r\nIn reflecting on this important and critical change in the situation,\r\nI bore in mind that the said King of Sulu had been a false friend\r\nand a consummate Machiavellian, who had deceived your Majesty's\r\nGovernor Fernando Valdes Tamon with his feigned promises of peace,\r\nwhich he never kept, and that, instead of releasing the captives and\r\npreventing the cruel outrages of his vassals the Moros and Tirons,\r\nhe had used the considerable supply of arms, which he received\r\nfrom the said Governor and Governor Gaspar de la Torre under the\r\npretence of suppressing supposed rebellions of his vassals, to keep\r\nour forces busy in Sulu, so that his vassals the Tiron pirates might\r\nravage the provinces, while our forces were engaged in the Sulu\r\nkingdom. He also deceived your Majesty's Governor and Bishop when\r\na fleet was sent against the Tirons; he went as an ally and a pilot\r\nfor the fleet among the shallows, and the small islands belonging to\r\nthe enemy, and prevented the destruction of the principal towns, by\r\nmisrepresenting to the commander of the expedition that said towns\r\nbelonged to peaceful people who were friends of his, and pledging\r\nhimself to have the prisoners returned, so that the fleet retired\r\nafter burning only nine villages without importance, thanks to the\r\ncunning of the king. The trouble caused by all these Moros, thanks\r\nto his influence, is really astounding, and has nearly drained the\r\nRoyal treasury, as, since the last peace agreement made by Governor\r\nTamon, 89,744 pesos have been spent from 1736 to 1740, and since then\r\nthe war expenses have far exceeded that amount. All these criminal\r\nand astute antecedents fully justify my distrust in giving careful\r\ninstructions to the Master-of-camp to avoid a surprise of the fort\r\nunder the veil of feigned friendship; I really expected this new act\r\nof treason on account of what I already knew about the said King of\r\nSulu, and was only held back by the fact that he had been baptized,\r\nand the information about him which my predecessor had given me in\r\ngood faith. As it is, all the members of the Government were glad\r\nthat the treachery of the King had been foreseen and that he had been\r\narrested. * * *\r\n\r\nIn Zamboanga, after his arrest, 12 krises, each in six pieces,\r\nwere found hidden in two cushions belonging to him. * * * Urged\r\nby the members of the ministry, I proceeded at once to explain to\r\nthe Real Acuerdo [270] and the council of war all the difficulty of\r\ninflicting the condign punishment that was deserved, and, supported by\r\na majority of votes, I decided to declare war on all the Sulus, Tirons\r\nand Kamukons, with the understanding that no capitulations or treaties\r\nof peace would be considered, but that they would be treated as rebels,\r\nin their persons, their property and their land, and put to the sword\r\nin case of resistance; that all their towns would be destroyed and\r\nburned; and that the mission of our fleet was not to make conquests,\r\nbut to punish the rebellion and to blockade the island of Sulu so as\r\nto prevent any attempt to bring in food or any other help. I also\r\ndirected that the King of Sulu, who was under arrest at Zamboanga,\r\nshould be sent to Manila, there to be kept in confinement until the\r\npleasure of your Majesty be known. The Datus and other Moros were\r\ndeclared to be slaves, and I ordered that they should be branded and\r\nmarked, not so much for the purpose of guaranteeing the ownership of\r\ntheir masters or punishing their obstinacy, as for that of avoiding\r\nall confusion between them and the numerous Indians of these Islands,\r\nwhom they resemble in color, bearing and language, of crushing their\r\npride, their daring and their evil spirit, experience having shown\r\nthat 8 Sulus suffice to subjugate a whole town, and principally\r\nof preventing the clandestine introduction of the sect of Mohammed,\r\nwhich would easily spread among the Indians, if the brand did not mark\r\nthem as enemies from Sulu, it being known that the sect of Mohammed\r\nis daily extending its darkness over these regions. * * *\r\n\r\nThe declaration of war against the Moros was published in all the\r\nprovinces, which were instructed to be constantly ready for attack\r\nor defense; to organize companies of militia, with their officers,\r\nin all the pueblos, and have them frequently drilled and reviewed, so\r\nas to become skilful in the use of their arms; to send a list of all\r\nthe arms and ammunition on hand to the Captain-General, who will thus\r\nbe able to supply them with all he may deem necessary. I furthermore\r\nordered that no boat should leave Manila or any other port without\r\nbeing well provided with men and arms, and issued proclamations calling\r\nfor privateers, several of whom have already been given letters of\r\nmarque and have sailed with the hope of doing good service for your\r\nMajesty; I issued new instructions on every subject, to be followed\r\nin their respective parts according to circumstances; I reserved for\r\nmy future action the disposal of our prisoners at the best terms,\r\none fifth of the profits going to the Royal treasury; the right of\r\nplundering was declared to be free for all, all privateers from the\r\nBisayas were exempted from tribute, and I promised them in the name\r\nof your Majesty 6 pesos for each Moro, as an encouragement to pursue\r\nand exterminate them. As soon as I heard the news from Zamboanga,\r\nI sent there a supply boat with plenty of food, arms and soldiers,\r\nin view of the next campaign; I took on myself the care of relieving\r\nfrom time to time the officers and soldiers * * * and I can sincerely\r\nassure your Majesty that I have been so provoked and exasperated\r\nby the untamable fierceness and the bad faith of the Moros, that I\r\nam decided to spare neither work nor efforts in order to punish them\r\nthoroughly and to deliver from oppression the Christian communities, so\r\nthat the glorious name of your Majesty may be feared and respected all\r\nthrough my Government, in compensation for the gross deceit practised\r\nby said Moros upon my predecessors. I trust, with the help of God,\r\nto punish them as they deserve, and will report to your Majesty the\r\nprogress of the expedition.\r\n\r\nGod keep the Catholic and Royal Person of your Majesty many years,\r\nas Christendom and the Monarchy have need.\r\n\r\n\r\nManila, June 18, 1752.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX IX\r\n\r\nREPORT ON THE OCCUPATION OF PALAWAN AND BALABAK, APRIL 30, 1753 [271]\r\n\r\n\r\nSire: By letter forwarded to your Majesty through confidential channels\r\nunder date of * * * I reported that I had despatched an embassador to\r\nthe King of Bruney, informing him of the arrest of the King of Sulu for\r\nhis inveterate faithlessness, and pressing him to continue our long\r\nstanding friendship and to form a new alliance against the said king\r\nas a usurper of part of his dominions, and against all his enemies,\r\nand to cede to your Majesty the Island of Balabak and the territory\r\nof Palawan, for the purpose of better waging war against the Sulus,\r\nTirons and Kamukons; and that, the desired end having been obtained,\r\nI found it necessary to use the new rights acquired by the cession\r\nreferred to. Consequently, with the view of best promoting your\r\nMajesty's interests, I resolved to put into execution the idea of\r\nan armament composed of our galleys, a tender, three feluccas, and\r\ntwo champanes, supplied with two Spanish companies of one hundred\r\nmen each, together with another company of Pampanga Indians, which,\r\nwith the crews, the convicts and the military officers, number nearly\r\na thousand persons, for the glorious object of taking possession of La\r\nPampanga in the ceded part of Balabak and the other adjacent islands,\r\nforming this new district into a province called Trinidad, with a\r\nseparate government from that of the Kalamians; for I have appointed\r\na governor to take charge of nourishing this new plantation with the\r\npolitical regulations and Royal ordinances which the prudent zeal of\r\nyour Majesty has provided for similar cases, and which, on my part,\r\nhave been furnished him in the form of brief and clear instructions\r\ndirected towards civilizing those barbarous natives, so as the better\r\nto facilitate the spread of the holy Gospel.\r\n\r\nWith this in view I am sending two reverend Jesuit priests, persons\r\ndistinguished in politics and mathematical learning, and the military\r\nengineer of this place, for the purpose of making an inspection of\r\nthe capital of Palawan, as well as of the Island of Balabak, and its\r\nadjacent islands, and of examining their bays, ports, inlets, rivers,\r\nanchorages and depths, in order to construct a fort--which will be\r\nnamed after Our Lady of the Good End--in the most healthful location,\r\nsecure by land as well as by sea, for the garrisoning of which an\r\nadequate force of artillery has been despatched. It will be kept\r\nguarded for the present by a small galley, two feluccas, a company of\r\nSpaniards, and another company of Pampanga Indians, besides the galley\r\nslaves [272] and the suite of the governor, and officials--all rationed\r\nfor one year--who will number three hundred, the rest being returned to\r\nthis capital when possession is once established. And that the taking\r\nof possession may be unopposed, useful, and lasting, I have planned for\r\nthe strengthening of the said fort, with the primary object of having\r\nour troops sally from its walls to pacify the Sulu rebels who have\r\nbeen dwelling in certain districts of Palawan, or to exterminate them\r\ncompletely by fire and sword, preventing by means of the new fortress\r\nand the little flying squadron, the Kamukons, Tirons, and others, from\r\nlaying waste the province of the Kalamians, and the adjacent islands;\r\nfor, there being access to the entire chain of places and all the\r\nislands, facilitating attacks, and our vessels being on a constant\r\ncruise through those regions, their expulsion will be secured. But\r\nthe greatest gain of all will lie in becoming acquainted with their\r\nlands, rendezvous and places of refuge, in view of the fact that the\r\ngreatest defense which they have had up to the present time has been\r\nour own ignorance and negligence in the premises, they scorning our\r\narms without fear, in the belief that they are unconquerable because\r\nthe places of their abode are unexplored; wherefore the King of Sulu,\r\npretending to serve us as a pilot among the Tiron Islands laughed at\r\nour expedition under the command of your Majesty's Reverend Bishop of\r\nNueva Segovia, leading the Spaniards about with a halter wherever he\r\nwished, and wherever he thought they would suffer most fatigue. In\r\nview of all this, and of our present experience of the unbridled\r\naudacity with which they ravage almost all the provinces, I felt\r\ncompelled to project this campaign of reconnaissance so as to test,\r\nby the favorable results secured, the surest means of benefiting these\r\nChristian communities, for I am in hopes of establishing, through this\r\nnew colony, an impregnable bulwark against the whole Moro power and\r\na source of reciprocal assistance to the fortress at Zamboanga. And\r\nI likewise propose to introduce into those parts, by reason of their\r\nproximity, commerce with Borneo, Siam, Cambodia, and Cochin-China,\r\nso that, through intercourse, the inhabitants of Palawan may become\r\npacified and tractable and their towns become opulent; so that with\r\nthe families which in due time will be drafted from the outskirts\r\nof this capital, a province of substantial usefulness may be formed,\r\nhaving greater respect for both Majesties; for, by erecting churches\r\nto God, a new gem will be added to the Royal crown, namely the glory\r\nof giving many souls to the Lord, while the savings of the Royal\r\ntreasury will in time be appreciable.\r\n\r\nAlthough I intended to make this journey personally, the noble city\r\n[273] and the majority of the committee on war opposed this course,\r\nand with the sanction of the Audiencia convened in executive session\r\nI decided to delegate my authority for this act, in view of the\r\nnecessity of my remaining in the capital for the despatch of the\r\nurgent and arduous affairs which frequently present themselves.\r\n\r\nGod guard the Royal Catholic Person of your Majesty the many years\r\nthat Christendom needs him.\r\n\r\n\r\nManila, April 30, 1753.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX X\r\n\r\nBRIEF REPORT ON THE EXPEDITION TO TAKE POSSESSION OF PALAWAN, JULY 17,\r\n1753 [274]\r\n\r\n\r\nSire: When the galleon was on the point of sailing for New Spain,\r\nthe Palawan expedition returned to the port of Cavite, from where\r\nthe commander of the expedition informs me that he has made a careful\r\nand exact survey of the Islands of Palawan and Balabak, beginning on\r\nthe outward coast, from 9 degrees to Labo. On all that coast he has\r\nonly found mangrove swamps and reefs, the inhabitants being hostile\r\nto everyone and obeying no king; the land is miserably poor; there is\r\nno drinking water from Balabak to Ipolote; the climate is so bad that\r\nin two months and a half 116 men of the expedition died and 200 were\r\nsick, and he finds that all that has been said about Palawan is false.\r\n\r\nI have also been informed by the Alcalde Mayor of the Kalamians of the\r\narrival there of one galley, and three feluccas, which had left the\r\nfleet since it sailed from Manila, as the Commander also now reports;\r\nafter the galley had been careened and food provided, one felucca\r\nsailed on its course convoying the joanga [275] of the father prior\r\nin charge of that district and two small vessels which had been sent\r\nby the Alcalde of Komboy and had suffered the misfortune of being\r\ncaptured by the Sulu Moros, most of the people, however, escaping,\r\nas explained in the enclosed letter from the Alcalde.\r\n\r\nThe commander of the expedition has sent me from Cavite a report of\r\nthe councils of war held by him for the purpose of carrying out his\r\ninstructions, the most important of which was to take possession\r\nof Palawan and adjacent islands in the name of your Majesty, said\r\nislands having been ceded by the King of Bruney; accordingly, our\r\nfleet took possession of the land with due solemnity, with the express\r\nknowledge and consent of the inhabitants; I also received a log of\r\nthe whole route which seems to have been well kept, with maps and\r\na full explanation of the examination made of the said islands and\r\nthe operations in connection therewith. A new map of the islands is\r\nbeing made, on account of the errors contained in the former one; as\r\nthe log and the report of the commander refer to the new map, which\r\nis unfinished, and I cannot delay the departure of the galleon, I\r\ncannot forward a full report to your Majesty; I wish to make a serious\r\nand careful examination of all that has been done, so as to take\r\nsuch action as may be the best for the benefit of the Royal service,\r\nand to be able to send your Majesty a full report of the expedition,\r\nwith my opinion based on a complete knowledge of the facts. This is\r\nall the information I can give your Majesty for the present.\r\n\r\nGod keep the Catholic Royal Person, of your Majesty many years,\r\nas Christendom has need.\r\n\r\n\r\nManila, July 17, 1753.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XI\r\n\r\nLETTER OF THE KING OF SPAIN TO SULTAN ISRAEL, DECEMBER 2, 1774 [276]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Captain-General of the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost illustrious Sir: In letters Nos. 322 and 325, your Excellency sets\r\nforth the ideas of the English settled in the island of Balambangan,\r\nwho are displeased with the unhealthfulness of the country and petition\r\nthat the Sultan of Sulu allow them to settle within his dominions.\r\n\r\nWith No. 325, the letter of the Sultan was received, and the King, thus\r\ninformed of the attempts of the Englishmen, and also of the favorable\r\ninclination of the Sulu Sultan to establish with our nation friendship\r\nand alliance, commands me to direct you to listen to his proposals,\r\nto accede to them whenever they are reasonable, and to grant him aid\r\nand favor as far as possible, assuring him of Royal protection, and\r\ndelivering to him the enclosed communication in answer to his own, in\r\nwhich his Catholic Majesty declares his entire satisfaction with his\r\nreasonable conduct and promises to reciprocate his friendship as you\r\nmay understand through the copy of that letter which I enclose. God\r\npreserve your Excellency many years.\r\n\r\n\r\nMadrid, December 5, 1774.\r\n\r\nDr. Julian de Biriaga.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Copy of the communication referred to in the foregoing letter.]\r\n\r\nMost illustrious and excellent prince Mohammed Israel, Sultan\r\nof Sulu. Most gratifying has been to me the announcement, which\r\nyou conveyed to me in your letter of January 20th, of your happy\r\naccession to the sovereignty of Sulu, on account of which I offer\r\nyou many congratulations, wishing you happiness in all things.\r\n\r\nThe disposition which inclines you to seek my friendship and\r\nassistance, as also the friendly relations which you maintain with\r\nmy Governor of the Philippines, which you desire to establish and\r\nperpetuate by means of a mutual agreement, which may secure for the\r\nfuture firm peace and a perpetual alliance between your states and\r\nmine, increase my just gratification, especially as my Governor has\r\ninformed me of the sublime natural gifts which are united in your\r\nperson, with many and most expressive eulogies thereof.\r\n\r\nIn view of this, and of the constant fidelity which you promise in\r\nyour letter, I command my good vassal, Don Simon de Anda y Salazar, to\r\nlisten to your proposals, to accede to them whenever reasonable, and to\r\ngrant you all the favor and assistance which the forces and facilities\r\nto be found there may allow assuring you of my Royal protection, which\r\nI extend to you from now on, confiding in your reciprocal friendship,\r\nand noble conduct, and desirous of opportunities of favoring you and\r\nof proving the interest which I feel in your good fortunes and the\r\nearnestness with which I pray God to preserve you many years.\r\n\r\n\r\nMadrid, December 2, 1774.\r\n\r\nI, the King.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XII\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM THE CAPTAIN-GENERAL OF THE PHILIPPINES FORWARDING A COPY\r\nOF THE TREATY OF PEACE, PROTECTION, AND COMMERCE WITH SULU, DECEMBER\r\n25, 1836 [277]\r\n\r\n\r\nSuperior Government of the Philippines\r\n\r\nMost Excellent Sir: After having reported to your Excellency in my\r\nthree former communications, the opinion which I have formed with\r\nregard to the countries in the vicinity of our possessions in the\r\nsouthern part of the Philippines, of the relations which we ought\r\nto sustain with their governments and the policy we should follow\r\nuntil we shall obtain the immense advantages which our position\r\noffers us, I have the honor to deliver to your Excellency a copy of\r\nthe Capitulations of the Treaty of Peace, Protection, and Commerce,\r\nwhich I have concluded through the captain of frigate, Don José María\r\nHalcon, with the Sultan and Datus of Sulu.\r\n\r\nThe articles which need some explanation, are the 1st, 3rd and\r\n4th. With reference to the 3rd and 4th, I mention them in my former\r\ncommunication and indicate their intent; and with respect to the 1st,\r\nI copy herewith what has been reported to me by the commissioner,\r\nD. José María Halcon, which is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I must make clear an important point relating to the text of the\r\n    Capitulations, in the wording of which your Excellency has noted\r\n    perhaps some ambiguities and omissions in Article I, which while\r\n    intended to make the Datus and Sultan of Sulu acknowledge and\r\n    declare the extent of our rights, seems indefinite on certain\r\n    points which many irresponsible writers have asserted with\r\n    confidence.\r\n\r\n    While considering the protection granted the Sultan, I recognized\r\n    the inexpediency of making the same include the lands which he has\r\n    lately acquired in Borneo, and of determining definitely the line\r\n    of the boundary in Palawan, the title to which island, as also that\r\n    to Balabak and Balambangan, is very disputable, though at present,\r\n    the lands where we have not established our settlements of the\r\n    province of Kalamians are included de facto in his possessions.\r\n\r\n    Palawan was ceded to the Crown of Spain by the King of Bruney,\r\n    and Balabak is likewise ceded by an instrument brought back by\r\n    D. Antonio Fabean when he went there as Embassador under the\r\n    administration of the Marquis of Obando, which should be in the\r\n    archives of the Philippine Government; but since these cessions\r\n    were made on an occasion when the Sultan of Sulu found himself\r\n    in possession of the lands by virtue of a former cession made in\r\n    his favor by another King of Bruney, such documentary testimony\r\n    cannot serve as the basis of our arguments, especially since we\r\n    did not proceed to found any settlements.\r\n\r\n    This matter of the cession of Balabak occurred upon the occasion\r\n    of a visit to Manila, of Sultan Mohammed Alimud Din (Fernando I)\r\n    who, asserting his right to the island, executed and ratified upon\r\n    his part the gift, at least in word, through D. Manuel Fernandez\r\n    Toribio, afterward Governor of Zamboanga, and the Secretary of\r\n    the Government.\r\n\r\n    Our writers have misrepresented the subsequent conduct of the\r\n    said Sultan, and concealed very important facts, but at any rate,\r\n    the very concealment of the reasons for his fleeing from Manila\r\n    betokens the lack of liberty in all of the instruments he granted\r\n    during his stay in that place; moreover the facts in the case\r\n    justify his later actions, which gave occasion for casting a doubt\r\n    over the legitimacy of our title to the lands under consideration.\r\n\r\n    The true reason for the actions of Mohammed Alimud Din, beginning\r\n    with his flight from Manila, was the fact that he had purchased\r\n    the secret in a copy of the confidential letter which the First\r\n    Minister of the Monarchy, Marquis de la Ensenada, wrote to the\r\n    Captain-General of the Philippines on August 28, 1751, discussing\r\n    the states of Sulu; which document, when brought to his knowledge,\r\n    could not fail to ruin all of our political moves, and to dispose\r\n    him to take every defensive measure against our power, for Mohammed\r\n    Alimud Din was a man of no mean understanding.\r\n\r\n    This was the origin of the letters which, on September 17, 1763,\r\n    the said Sultan wrote from Sulu to the King of England and to\r\n    the English company, [278] ratifying in favor of the latter\r\n    the concession of the lands which form the strait of Balabak,\r\n    in which is comprised the southern part of Palawan from Point\r\n    Kanipaan to Point Bulilaruan, and this was the origin of their\r\n    settlements in Balabak and Balambangan which have been abandoned\r\n    since later events.\r\n\r\n    Such are the antecedents which induced me to draw up the said\r\n    article with such ambiguity that it may be construed to the\r\n    advantage of the Crown without giving occasion to embarrassing\r\n    objections.\r\n\r\n    My aim throughout, most illustrious Sir, has been to promote\r\n    the national welfare by carrying out the high designs of your\r\n    Excellency, who by promoting this enterprise has attempted to open\r\n    up one of the most abundant sources of wealth in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also deliver to your Excellency a copy of the Capitulations, in\r\nwhich, in consequence of Article 2nd, it has been agreed to determine\r\nthe duties to be paid by the Sulu vessels in Zamboanga and Manila,\r\nand ours in Sulu. For the better understanding of these stipulations,\r\nI have thought it expedient to inclose a copy of the explanation with\r\nwhich the said commissioner forwarded them to me.\r\n\r\nThe present tariff rates have served as a basis for the duties\r\nimposed upon the Sulu vessels, it being beyond my authority to\r\nalter them. With reference to those which shall be paid by our\r\nvessels in Joló, although they may appear to be excessive, it will\r\nbe sufficient to inform your Excellency that all of the ship-owners\r\nwho are accustomed to make voyages to Joló, have been satisfied with\r\nthe very favorable terms we have secured in the agreement, not only\r\nbecause of the high valuation set on the articles in which payment\r\nwill be made, but because of the regulation and reduction to fixed\r\nrules of the charges, that until now have been arbitrary and never\r\nless than the stipulated rates. It is true that they have desired not\r\nonly a greater reduction but still more their complete abolition,\r\nas is natural, but it was necessary to conciliate the two parties,\r\nas the commissioner says.\r\n\r\nAbove all, one of the advantages of importance which our merchants\r\nrecognize in the relations now established, the benefits of which\r\nthey have begun already to experience, is that the Sultan and Datus\r\ntogether guarantee the credits left in Sulu as a result of commercial\r\noperations, which advantage they have not heretofore enjoyed,\r\nbut waited on the will and good faith of the debtor, who paid if he\r\npleased and when he pleased, or perhaps never, and there existed no\r\nmeans of compelling him as there now is by recourse to the Government.\r\n\r\nLikewise through the preference they are now accorded, our merchants\r\nhave gained greatly, as your Excellency will comprehend. In short,\r\nthere is not one of them who is not well satisfied with the results\r\nof the negotiations, and all appreciate the skill and prudence with\r\nwhich Halcon has conducted himself upon a mission all the more delicate\r\nand difficult since he has had to treat with a Government whose lack\r\nof enlightenment and poorness of organization equal the barbarism of\r\nits people.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the answer given by the Chamber of Commerce of which I\r\ninclose a copy, your Excellency will perceive the appreciation which\r\nthe Capitulations have brought him, by having settled the duties to be\r\npaid by our vessels in Sulu, as also by having established relations\r\nwith the Government of that island.\r\n\r\nI trust that your Excellency will condescend to bring all this to\r\nthe notice of her Majesty that she may grant her Royal approval.\r\n\r\nGod preserve your Excellency many years.\r\n\r\n\r\nManila, December 25, 1836.\r\n\r\nMost excellent Sir,\r\n\r\n(Sgd.) Pedro Antonio Salazar.--Rubricated.\r\n\r\nThe most excellent the Secretary of State and of the Office of\r\n\"Gobernación\" of the Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XIII\r\n\r\nROYAL DIRECTIONS RELATIVE TO A GENERAL POLICY AND THE REGULATION OF\r\nCOMMERCE WITH SULU, AND THE ADVISABILITY OF MAKING ZAMBOANGA A FREE\r\nPORT, JUNE 23, 1837 [279]\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistry of the Navy, Commerce, and Colonial Administration\r\n\r\nMost Excellent Sir: Your Excellency's predecessor, Don Pedro Antonio\r\nSalazar, when he reported in detail, in letters of last December,\r\nall that he had done in the treaty of friendship and commerce\r\nentered into with the Sultan of Sulu, of the mercantile relations\r\nwhich it behooves us to maintain with the Mohammedan possessions to\r\nthe south of the Philippines, of the opinion which he had formed\r\nconcerning the war of enslavement, and other matters upon which\r\nyour Excellency will receive due instructions under Royal order\r\nof this date, forwarded separately and privately, in a very secret\r\nmanner, a communication dated the 17th of the same month, in which\r\nhe set forth the policy, which, according to his belief, should be\r\nadopted toward the said Kingdom of Sulu in consequence of the said\r\ntreaty. Her Majesty the Queen Regent, having been informed of all\r\nthis, and having in mind the remark made in the said communication,\r\nthat the Spanish possessions in the southern region are frequently\r\noppressed by the alcaldes, on account of the present defective system\r\nof administration, has decided to direct your Excellency to suppress,\r\nwith strong hand, these excesses of the alcaldes, that they may not\r\ndisturb the peace happily established with Sulu; exhorting them to\r\nmoderation and peaceableness, in order that the odium which the Moro\r\nrace feels toward us may vanish. Noting also among his remarks, his\r\nconclusion that while the war of enslavement is undoubtedly an evil,\r\nit produces nevertheless the advantage that those provinces are united\r\nmore closely to the Government because of their greater need of the\r\nsame against their enemies; and that by becoming used to a life of\r\nfreedom and license, those people become also inured to captivity,\r\nfrom which they could sometimes escape but do not, many preferring to\r\nturn to piracy, Her Majesty holds these views erroneous and harmful,\r\nsince no just and paternal government should promote misfortunes among\r\nits subjects in order to make itself more necessary, and thus keep\r\nthem dependent; and because, though there may be some who are content\r\nwith slavery in Sulu because it affords them a life of unrestraint,\r\nit can not be ignored that their families and the Government suffer\r\na great injury from their situation, nor that morality would be\r\ngreatly outraged, if, for these reasons, countenance were given to\r\nslavery, which should be attacked and exterminated at all costs. The\r\nidea is advanced in the same communication, that in the countries\r\nof the southern part of the Philippines, the system of protection,\r\ncarried to the point of establishing trading houses, will be almost\r\nequivalent to possession and control, when once commercial interests\r\nare held to be the chief interests, and there is set forth a plan to\r\ndiminish or even cut off the trade [280] with Mindanao, in order to\r\nconfine the commerce to our channels. Her Majesty, on being informed\r\nof this policy of a protectorate, approves of the same, but desires\r\nthat it be carried out frankly and faithfully with the Sultan of Sulu,\r\nin order that he be convinced, through experience, that the Spaniards\r\nare his loyal friends, our authorities keeping it in mind that the\r\nconquest of those countries is not to the interest of the nation, but\r\nrather the acquisition of isolated military and mercantile stations,\r\nwhich may control indirectly without the disadvantages of great expense\r\nand of arousing the hatred of the natives. This alliance or friendship\r\nwith the Sultan should be such, that in whatever war he may be engaged\r\nwith his rebellious subjects, he shall be aided in good faith, unless\r\nhis adversary should be of such strength as to insure his triumph,\r\nfor then the useless defense of the vanquished would subject us\r\nto the contempt of the conqueror and we should lose the benefits\r\nalready acquired. In such cases we should remain neutral, under some\r\nplausible pretext of impracticableness or other honorable reason. In\r\nother wars, waged by the Sultan with other princes, we should attempt\r\nto mediate, with the purpose that, by settling new discords, we may\r\nobtain advantages from the two or more belligerents, as rewards for\r\nthe services rendered them; but in the event of having to oppose some\r\none of them, it should be that one who offers us the least advantages,\r\nand has the best chances of triumph, because with our ally victorious,\r\nthe latter may in the treaty of peace execute articles favorable to our\r\ncommerce,--trying always, above all things, so to act that the victor\r\nshall not become too strong nor the vanquished brought too low. With\r\nregard to the policy which it is best to adopt as a general rule in\r\nregard to commerce, your Excellency should remember that the best\r\nsystem consists in the greatest possible liberty for our merchandise,\r\nand in securing, directly or indirectly, for our own merchandise,\r\nor foreign goods carried by the national vessels, the enjoyment of\r\ngreater privileges than those of any other country, in order that\r\nthey may be preferred and produce greater profits on the markets.\r\n\r\nIn the same letter he submits the opinion that the lack of\r\ncommunication of the countries to the south with the Philippines, is a\r\nmost favorable political measure for Spanish commerce, and recommends\r\nthat our relations with the Government of Sulu should be strengthened\r\nin order to include the same under our dependence at some future\r\ntime, it being necessary to act with cunning in order to separate\r\nit completely from the piratical warfare. Her Majesty commands me\r\nto state to you concerning these matters, that the communication\r\nof Sulu with the Philippines being purely commercial, should not\r\nbe restricted, but on the contrary, should be increased in every\r\nway possible, encouragement should be given to the establishment of\r\ntraders and Spanish trading houses in Sulu, where our good conduct and\r\nbenevolence toward the natives may bring us profit. But it is always\r\nto be borne in mind that the Government of Her Majesty does not desire\r\nthe subjection of other states to itself, but a sincere friendship\r\nand a close and useful alliance, and that a just and discreet policy,\r\nnot crafty nor artful, will accomplish most in withdrawing the Sultan\r\nfrom the interests of the leaders of the pirates.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency will note in the draft of the communication from\r\nyour predecessor, to which I make answer, the proposal of various\r\nschemes for establishing ourselves securely in Sulu. Such would be\r\nthe establishment of a trading house there, already agreed upon in\r\nthe treaty, and posting there a garrison, under the pretext that it\r\nis for the safety and greater state of the person of the Sultan. Her\r\nMajesty deems indispensable the establishment of the trading house,\r\nbut it should be done in such a manner as not to cause distrust,\r\nand fortified and protected from any sudden attack, using in this the\r\ngreatest prudence, and remembering that a garrison there, though it\r\nmight be acceptable to the Sultan, might wound the self-love of the\r\npeople of the country, and so render odious both the Sultan and his\r\nprotectors. The most essential thing for the Spaniards, in order to\r\nbecome firmly established, is to make themselves popular, to respect\r\nthe customs of the people, even with veneration, not offending any\r\none for any reason, treating all with courtesy and decorum; not\r\nshowing themselves domineering nor covetous, not insulting any one,\r\nbut being very respectful to women, the old and children, not scoffing\r\nat anything in their public amusements, nor religious affairs, nor\r\nin their meetings. It seems to her Majesty that through these means\r\nwould be secured a consistent friendship between both countries,\r\nand that the most adequate plan for the support and defense of the\r\ntrading house would be to maintain in the safest harbor a permanent\r\nmaritime force, in which should be stored all arms and munitions,\r\nand sufficient soldiers, in case it should be necessary to defend\r\nthe building, without arousing the suspicions that would be caused\r\nby placing these preparations, concealed or openly, in the house\r\nitself; and since for this purpose, for the defense of the country\r\nagainst the pirates, and for maintaining the respect of the people\r\nand Government of the protectorate, it is indispensable to keep a\r\nwell organized sea force, her Majesty had determined that you decide\r\nthe manner of organizing this maritime force, without losing sight\r\nof the great economy which it is necessary to observe on account of\r\nthe embarrassed condition of the Peninsula, which needs now more than\r\never before the assistance of her colonial provinces.\r\n\r\nFinally, the predecessor of your Excellency further stated that\r\nhe was attempting to extend his efforts to the establishing of the\r\nprotectorate over the countries subject to the Sultan of Mindanao:\r\nher Majesty approves this policy on condition that in its execution the\r\npurposes and measures, which are mentioned above for Sulu, be adopted.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty, by whose Royal order I communicate to your Excellency\r\nthe foregoing, trusts in your zeal to realize the importance of this\r\nmatter, and, regarding the principles of justice and right which\r\ndirect the resolutions of her Majesty, to direct all your efforts\r\nto the accomplishment of the results desired; carefully reporting\r\nyour progress in the affair, for the information of her Majesty and\r\nfurther action. God preserve your Excellency many years.\r\n\r\n\r\nMadrid, June 23, 1837.\r\n\r\nMendizabal.--Rubricated.\r\n\r\nThe Governor Captain-General of the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistry of the Navy, Commerce, and Colonial Administration\r\n\r\nMost Excellent Sir: The predecessor of your Excellency, convinced of\r\nthe important advantages to be derived by the Philippines, in making\r\nmore intimate and more secure our few and doubtful relations with\r\nthe island of Sulu, determined immediately upon assuming command,\r\nto negotiate with the Sultan of the said place, a treaty of peace\r\nand commerce which he considered, in every respect, not only useful\r\nbut indispensable to the prosperity of the country. After having\r\nannounced this project in various of his communications, he reported\r\nin December of last year, having accomplished the same, and furnished\r\nin several communications, an exact and detailed account of the\r\nhistory of his labors in the affair, the reasons which he had for\r\nundertaking the same, the benefits which he expects as results, and\r\nthe measures whose adoption he deems necessary in order that these\r\nresults may be more certain, and at the same time profitable. There\r\nwere received from him seven letters, all marked with the letter \"A,\"\r\nnumbered from 14 to 23, and dated from the 15th to the 29th of the\r\nsaid month; with so many points of analogy and similarity between\r\nthem, that they should be considered as one only. The first, number\r\n14, is intended to furnish information and data relative to Sulu,\r\nand the other Mohammedan islands of the south (without which it would\r\nbe impossible to know their importance) and to detail the relations\r\nwhich we should have with them, considering them both in relation to\r\ncommerce and with respect to the war of enslavement. In the second, of\r\na confidential nature, he outlines the policy, which, in his opinion,\r\nshould be adopted in order to obtain all the advantages which our\r\nposition affords. In the third, number 16, he states the measures\r\nwhich should be adopted for the benefit of the national commerce\r\nin those countries. In the fourth, number 20, he transmits a copy\r\nof the treaty of peace, protection and commerce concluded with the\r\nSultan of Sulu, and of the stipulations made for the determination\r\nof the duties which our vessels should pay in Sulu, and the Sulus\r\nin Manila and Zamboanga. In the fifth, number 21, he relates the\r\nmotives which have led him to direct these matters as he has done,\r\ntransmitting to her Majesty all the plans referring to it, through this\r\nMinistry only. In the sixth, number 22, he gives account of some of\r\nthe advantages which have been derived from our expedition to Sulu,\r\nand amongst others, a treaty of peace concluded between the pueblo\r\nof Malusu and the Governor of Zamboanga. And finally, in the seventh,\r\nnumber 23, he sets forth the necessity of retaining at that station,\r\nthe frigate-captain, Don José María Halcon, who performed the duty\r\nof commissioner for the negotiation of the treaty.\r\n\r\nI have informed her Majesty, the Queen Regent, of the contents of\r\nall these communications, and in this knowledge she has seen fit\r\nto approve, in a general manner, all the measures adopted by the\r\naforementioned predecessor of your Excellency, giving suitable orders,\r\nthat the proper Ministry provide the special approval which some of\r\nthem deserve, on account of their weight and importance, concerning\r\nwhich your Excellency will soon be informed, and deigning to command\r\nme to submit in a separate and particular communication the following\r\nadvice on the special subject of the letters referred to above.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty, feeling assured that conquests in themselves, and later\r\ntheir maintenance, absorb the profits which accrue from the countries\r\nalready acquired, prefers to any conquest advantageous trade and\r\ncommerce. Convinced, therefore, that the most profitable and lucrative\r\npolicy is to conquer or secure such places as on account of their\r\nfortunate location may prove to be at the same time strong military and\r\nmercantile posts and so both promote and protect commerce, she cannot\r\nbut approve the ideas your Excellency's predecessor expresses in his\r\ncommunication numbered 14, and desires, that upon adopting the system\r\nin accordance with those ideas, you confine yourself solely, in all\r\nenterprises of conquest, to occupation of territory either abandoned\r\nor uninhabited, or to that which, notwithstanding its being settled,\r\nwould cost little and would not give occasion for a costly war. In\r\norder to increase our commercial advantages in Sulu, and to raise up\r\nrivals to the Portuguese, it would be well to grant protection and\r\nreduction in duties to the Chinese junks [281] under the specific\r\ncondition that they do not sail under the flag of any other nation\r\n(without mentioning the Portuguese by name in order not to occasion\r\nthe resentment of this power) and to secure in Sulu for those who\r\nadopt the Spanish flag, a reduction of duties although not as much\r\nas that which should be granted to Spanish vessels. Thus it is the\r\nwill of her Majesty that you be directed, commanding, with the same\r\npurpose in view, that your predecessor state to you explicitly, which\r\nare the measures that he would have adopted, had he been authorized\r\nto do so, in order to avoid the blow to our commerce threatened by\r\nthe Portuguese, depriving us with the double expedition from Macao and\r\nSingapore to Sulu, of the advantage over all other nations which still\r\nremained to us in this traffic; and that your Excellency obstruct,\r\nby all the means in your power, the association of interests between\r\nthe commercial houses of Manila with those of Macao and Singapore,\r\nif the same were intended to secure special privileges in the island\r\nof Sulu to the products of the Philippines to the injury of the\r\nnational commerce.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the matter of the war against piracy, referred to also\r\nin letter number 14, her Majesty approves all the purposes expressed\r\ntherein by the predecessor of your Excellency, and commands me to\r\ndirect your Excellency that, without ever recurring to war or the\r\ninterruption of traffic with Sulu as means of destroying or diminishing\r\npiracy and traffic in slaves, you exert yourself to suppress the same\r\nand remedy the evil which it inflicts on the Philippines, by the\r\nvarious means at hand, to-wit; 1st, through negotiations with the\r\nSultan of Sulu; in which measures suitable for the accomplishment\r\nof the purpose may be concerted; 2d, securing the increase, by the\r\nSultan, of import duties on slaves who are Spanish subjects, and the\r\nlowering of duties on slaves of other countries; 3d, requesting of him\r\nassistance in driving out the pirates from their haunts of Balangingi\r\nand other places; 4th, watching the rendezvous of these pirates in\r\nthe Bisayas also, in order to destroy them. In this manner and with\r\nhard lessons, with the energetic and continuous warfare spoken of by\r\nthe predecessor of your Excellency, the extermination of piracy will\r\nbe accomplished without the evils which would follow upon an unwise\r\nand useless war against Sulu, and without the more serious result to\r\nwhich the same would expose us, and which her Majesty desires your\r\nExcellency to avoid at any cost, the result referred to being the\r\nremoval of the Sultan to some other point, which removal England and\r\nHolland might turn to great advantage against our trade.\r\n\r\nAs to the measures proposed in letter number 16, for the benefit\r\nof the national commerce, her Majesty will determine which is fit,\r\nnotifying your Excellency in due season. Meanwhile you should keep\r\nin mind, that as long as the Sulus man their ships with slaves,\r\nyour Excellency should prohibit them from trading in Zamboanga and\r\nall other places within the dominions of her Majesty, whenever the\r\nships which they use shall be manned in whole or in part with slaves\r\nwho are subjects of Spain.\r\n\r\nConcerning the treaty of peace, protection and commerce, a copy of\r\nwhich is inclosed in letter number 20, her Majesty has been pleased to\r\nresolve, after careful examination, that it be forwarded with favorable\r\ncomment to the Ministry of State for the approval of the Cortes and\r\nthe ratification of her Majesty, all of which will be communicated\r\nto your Excellency in due time, its policy being carried out and\r\nits intent carefully observed in the meanwhile, for the purpose of\r\ndetermining whether there is anything to amend or correct by means\r\nof further negotiation, which would be considered as an appendix to\r\nthe treaty. In view of the explanations concerning the first article\r\nof the aforementioned treaty furnished by the commissioner of the\r\nnegotiation, her Majesty commands me to repeat to your Excellency\r\nthe necessity for carrying out the policy which is prescribed to\r\nyour Excellency with regard to acquisition and conquest; in order to\r\nclaim those lands referred to in the explanations, if perchance such\r\nclaim should be advisable for the purpose of acquiring some point of\r\nmilitary or mercantile value: or in order to set up the claim of the\r\nKingdom of Spain to those countries, in order that by giving it up,\r\nwe may secure other things which may be of real importance to us, such\r\nas reduction in duties, some exclusive privilege, or the possession\r\nof some isolated point of great importance.\r\n\r\nThe predecessor of your Excellency by addressing to this Ministry all\r\ncommunications bearing on this matter, has merited the approbation\r\nof her Majesty, because he has avoided many unnecessary steps and\r\nuseless delay, and thus your Excellency will continue to do, in the\r\nmanner herein indicated.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, her Majesty having noted with satisfaction the favorable\r\nresults produced already by the expedition to Sulu, and approving\r\nthe idea of not using the fifteen hundred dollars sent by the Bishop\r\nof Nueva Segovia for the redemption of slaves, she commands me to\r\ndirect your Excellency to cultivate the friendship of all the chiefs\r\nwho, like the Orankaya of Malusu, abandon the pursuit of piracy,\r\nand that suitable orders be issued by the Division of the Marine\r\nof this Ministry, not only that the captain of frigate, Don José\r\nMaría Halcon, who has so well discharged the duty of negotiating the\r\ntreaty, be assigned to that station, but that he also be duly rewarded\r\nfor his services as such commissioner; her Majesty not failing to\r\nexpress the gratitude with which she declares her appreciation to the\r\npredecessor of your Excellency, the aforementioned Don Pedro Antonio\r\nSalazar. All of which is communicated to your Excellency, by Royal\r\norder, for your due information and guidance, instructing you with\r\nregard to the confidential letter, that you carry out the directions\r\nforwarded you separately under this date. God preserve your Excellency.\r\n\r\n\r\nMadrid, June 23, 1837.\r\n\r\nMendizabal.--Rubricated.\r\n\r\nThe Governor Captain-General of the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XIV\r\n\r\nCAMBA'S REPORT ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING THE TREATY OF 1836 AND\r\nITS BASES, NOVEMBER 16, 1837 [282]\r\n\r\n\r\nSuperior Government of the Philippines\r\n\r\nExcellent Sir: In compliance with the provision of the Royal order of\r\nthe 24th of April last, requesting, for the information of her Majesty\r\nthe record of the correspondence exchanged in regard to the treaty\r\nof commerce made by my predecessor with the Sultan of Sulu, and the\r\nbases of said treaty, I forward the same to your Excellency, with a\r\nfew personal observations suggested by a reading of the said papers.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of January, 1835, the Tribunal of Commerce forwarded to the\r\nCaptain-General, approved by it, a report presented by several business\r\nmen who traded with Sulu, setting forth the deceitful methods of the\r\nDatus, or principal people of the island, in their agreements and\r\ncontracts, and requesting, in order to restrain and intimidate them,\r\nthat the naval division of Zamboanga, or part of it, be stationed in\r\nthe port of Jolo during the time the national merchant vessels remain\r\nthere for the purpose of making their sales and purchases. A decree was\r\nissued on the 9th of March of the same year, concurring in the opinion\r\nof the Assessor, and declaring that the request could not be granted at\r\nthat time, but that it would be taken into consideration as soon as the\r\ncircumstances allowed. This is a brief of the document marked Number 1.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of February, 1836, José Dugiols, who had sold goods on\r\ncredit to the amount of 8000 pesos to the Jolo people, and despaired\r\nof getting paid, presented a new petition, similar to that which\r\nhad been sent 11 months before. The Chamber of Commerce approved it,\r\nand requested that a fleet of launches be stationed at Jolo during\r\nthe business season, there to gather information which would allow\r\nthe Government to take proper action in the matter; it also insisted\r\nthat the commander of the fleet be a capable person, who, without\r\ncompromising the flag, would know how to conciliate the purpose of\r\nthe naval demonstration with the spirit of peace and concord which he\r\nought to maintain between the crews of our ships and the people of\r\nJolo. This suggestion, which had already been made in the petition\r\npresented the year before, was favorably endorsed one after the\r\nother by all who intervened in the papers in the case and resulted\r\nin the final resolution of May 31st, which contains 14 articles. The\r\nfirst provides that it shall be one of the duties of the commander\r\nof the naval division of Zamboanga to protect the Spanish ships while\r\nthey are at Jolo, and instructions are given him to that effect. The\r\nsecond appoints captain of frigate José María Halcon to take charge,\r\ntemporarily, of the command of the Division of Zamboanga, and establish\r\nrelations of friendship and commerce with the Sulu people. The third\r\ndirects him to inform the Sulu Sultan of his visit in the way he may\r\ndeem most likely to convince him of the peaceful intentions of this\r\nGovernment. The fourth directs him to make himself recognized by the\r\nofficers and men of our ships, as the commanding authority who shall\r\nmaintain them in peace and good order. The fifth charges him not to\r\nallow his men to land, so as to avoid disorder. The sixth directs him\r\nto take action in regard to any excess, as provided by the Code. The\r\nseventh, to hold in check the crews of our ships, so as to give the\r\nSulus neither reason nor pretence for showing their bad faith. The\r\nninth forbids the commander of the division and all those under his\r\norders to enter into any business speculation whatsoever. The tenth\r\ndirects the commander to be ever careful to keep all his men within\r\nthe bounds of duty. By the eleventh he is directed to see that all\r\ncontracts are religiously fulfilled, and, if necessary, to complain\r\nenergetically to the Sultan, and by the twelfth to see that our people\r\nfulfil their own. Articles thirteen and fourteen direct the commander\r\nto obtain information about the political and civil conditions of\r\nSulu and its topographic situation.\r\n\r\nAfter acquainting himself with the foregoing, Captain José María\r\nHalcon inquired what would be the minimum importation duty in Manila\r\nfor articles proceeding from Sulu, and asked for instructions in\r\nregard to the importation of arms and ammunition into Sulu by our\r\nships. In answer to the first question, the Board of Tariffs fixed\r\nat 2 per cent the duty on all articles imported from Sulu to Manila\r\nin its own vessels, [283] except wax and cacao, which would have to\r\npay 14 per cent under a foreign flag and half that amount under the\r\nnational flag; in regard to the second the importation of arms and\r\nammunition into Sulu by our ships was prohibited.\r\n\r\nA letter to the Sultan of Sulu was furthermore given the commander,\r\naccrediting him and explaining his mission, the petition presented by\r\nDugiols and endorsed by the Chamber of Commerce, requesting that our\r\nbusiness relations with Sulu be granted a protection which experience\r\nmade each day more necessary, being thus complied with.\r\n\r\nOn April 15, 1836, Halcon forwarded the capitulations of peace and\r\nthe commercial agreements made by him in the name of this Government\r\nwith the Sultan of Sulu. The first consists of 6 articles, by which\r\nthe Spanish Government grants the Sultan its protection, which is\r\naccepted by the latter, with a mutual assurance of coöperation between\r\nthem against any nation not European. Spanish boats are to be admitted\r\nfreely in Sulu, and Sulu boats in Zamboanga and Manila. It is agreed\r\nthat a Spanish factory shall be established in Jolo, so as to avoid\r\ndamages and delays to our commerce, the same right being given the\r\nSulus in Manila. Certain rules are established in order to distinguish\r\nfriendly from hostile boats. The Sultan is pledged to prevent piracy on\r\nthe part of those who recognize his authority; and it is furthermore\r\nagreed that in case of any doubt as to the meaning of any article,\r\nthe literal Spanish text shall be followed. In accordance with the\r\nopinion of the Government assessor, these capitulations were approved\r\nby decree of January 20 of this year. The commercial agreements\r\ncontain 9 articles. The first establishes a duty of 2 1/2 per cent on\r\nall products brought by the Sulus. The second excepts wax and cacao,\r\nas recommended by the Board of Tariffs. The third provides a duty of\r\n1 per cent for the importation in Zamboanga of products brought by\r\nthe Sulus. The fourth provides that the payment of the duties shall\r\nbe made in cash in silver. The fifth establishes the dues to be\r\npaid by our boats at Sulu. The sixth fixes the value, in products,\r\nof those dues. The seventh, in its first part, declares, that all\r\nSulu boats trading without a license shall be treated as smugglers,\r\nunder the law of the Kingdom; in its second part it also requires\r\nour boats to show a bill of lading in accordance with the cargo,\r\non pain of a fine of P500, two thirds to go to the Sultan and one\r\nthird to our exchequer. The eighth provides that if the duties are\r\nreduced in Manila and Zamboanga on the articles coming from Sulu, the\r\nsame shall be done in Sulu, and that if the Sultan reduces the dues on\r\nforeign ships, he shall do the same for ours. The ninth provides that\r\nin case of doubt the literal Spanish text shall be followed. After\r\nhearing the opinions of the Boards of Commerce and Tariffs, and in\r\naccordance with that of the assessor, the foregoing was approved by\r\ndecree of the 20th of January of this year, with a small reduction\r\nof 1/2 per cent on the duties to be paid by the Sulus in Manila, and\r\nan explanation of the proceeding to be followed for the appraisement\r\nof their cargoes in Zamboanga and in Manila.\r\n\r\nShortly before this ratification by the Government, it was decreed on\r\nthe 13th of January, at the request of Commissioner Halcon, that in\r\norder to avoid trouble between this Government and that of Sulu, the\r\ncaptains and supercargoes of the Spanish ships should give no credit\r\nto the Sulus, except with the authorization of the Sultan, under the\r\npenalty of being barred from claiming his protection or that of the\r\nSpanish Government for the collection of such credits; and that all\r\nsettlements of the pay of the crews of our ships should be so made\r\nas to avoid the abuse of paying them in kind, instead of currency.\r\n\r\nSuch is the information which I have found, and am forwarding to your\r\nExcellency in regard to the treaties mentioned. The leading idea in\r\nsaid treaties is one of distrust towards the people of Sulu, on account\r\nof their treacherous, cruel and perfidious nature. As this is the\r\nonly idea which prevails in all our relations with the island, as well\r\nas in the Royal order of August 28, 1751, and the documents attached\r\nthereto, without referring to older time, I can not be persuaded that\r\nthe policy of peace and alliance adopted with the Sultan of Sulu can\r\ngive our shipping and commerce any substantial and permanent advantage.\r\n\r\nSeveral Royal decrees find fault with such treaties and even order them\r\nto be revoked in case they have been made; and to justify departure\r\nfrom these sovereign instructions, given with a true knowledge of the\r\nfacts, and in accordance with the opinion of the illustrious members of\r\nthe Cabinet, there must now be some powerful political reason which I\r\ncan not discover. If we take into consideration the very weak authority\r\nof the Sultan over his subjects, and the scarcity of his means in the\r\nmidst of datus or chieftains who, with their families and slaves,\r\nconstitute distinct communities which are haughty, ambitious and\r\ndangerous to him, we find that there is in Sulu no moral force on\r\nwhich to rely for the execution of a treaty, even should there be\r\nthe best faith and good will on the part of the Sultan.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Sulu and the small adjacent islands produce nothing; even\r\nthe rice and fish which the people use for their food come from our\r\nneighboring possessions: what business reasons are there therefore,\r\ncapable of calling our attention, or whose profits would pay the\r\nexpenses of a fleet placed in observation there? All the produce of\r\nthe islands consists of bêche-de-mer and shell which are gathered by\r\nthe slaves; [284] the clothing and foodstuffs are furnished them,\r\non credit, by our own ships; gold, wax and edible nests come from\r\nMindanao. Hence commerce is confined to a season outside of which\r\nour ships never go near Sulu.\r\n\r\nThere is therefore little advantage to be derived by our commerce\r\nfrom these treaties, and this is confirmed by the communication just\r\nreceived by me from the commander of the Zamboanga division, which I\r\nenclose as number 6. It betrays complete disappointment, and shows the\r\nwisdom of the instructions given in the above mentioned Royal decrees.\r\n\r\nThe policy which we ought to follow with the Sulus is one of continual\r\nand perspicacious caution, with well conditioned, well situated and\r\nwell commanded naval forces, ready to obtain at once satisfaction\r\nfor any offense to our flag; and I believe that this could be done\r\nwithout much trouble, by using steamships, as the Dutch have done\r\nin their settlements in the Moluccas, where they suffered from the\r\npiracy of the Moros much as we do in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing information covers, I believe, all the points mentioned\r\nin the Royal order of April 24th, last, and which are the object\r\nof the present communication and of the documents which I enclose\r\ntherewith. May God keep your Excellency many years.\r\n\r\n\r\nManila, November 16, 1837.\r\n\r\nAndrés G. Camba.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency the Secretary of State and of the Department of the\r\nNavy, Commerce, and Colonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XV\r\n\r\nCAMBA'S REPORT TO THE COLONIAL OFFICE DISCUSSING THE DIFFICULTIES OF\r\nCOMMERCE WITH SULU AND THE ADVISABILITY OF MAKING ZAMBOANGA A FREE\r\nPORT, FEBRUARY 23, 1838 [285]\r\n\r\n\r\nSuperior Government of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nExcellent Sir: I acknowledge to your Excellency the receipt of two\r\nRoyal orders dated the 23d of June of last year, which, with reference\r\nto the treaties made with the Sultan of Sulu, have been transmitted\r\nby your ministry; one replying to the seven communications marked \"A\"\r\nwhich my predecessor made in connection with the same subject; the\r\nother confidential, and indicating the policy and measures that should\r\nbe carried out with the said Sultan of Sulu and the Sultan of Mindanao.\r\n\r\nIn communication numbered 5, and dated November 16th last, in\r\ncompliance with one of the provisions of Royal order of last April,\r\nI made a minute report accompanied by documentary evidence, of the\r\nantecedents which I encountered relative to Sulu affairs, and at the\r\nsame time, could not but intimate in this connection how little I\r\nexpected as a result of our treaties, because experience had already\r\ncaused me to be suspicious, and also because the various Royal orders\r\ntoward the close of the past century confirmed me in this idea;\r\n[286] and indeed the losses which all our commercial expeditions\r\nexperienced during the first year of these treaties, the vexations\r\nthey suffered and the risks to which the crews as well as the vessels\r\nand their cargoes were exposed during their stay in Jolo, have fully\r\nborne out this view.\r\n\r\nMany are the measures and documents which we have here, in which\r\nthis same fact is laid down; many are the Royal decrees in which,\r\nin recognition of this fact, the Governors of the Philippines have\r\neven been authorized, by every means in their power and without\r\ncounting cost or difficulty, to punish severely the intrepidity of\r\nthose infidel barbarians.\r\n\r\nIn order to arouse and interest the Royal conscience on that point,\r\nit was requisite that there should be repeatedly presented through\r\nvarious channels and at distinct times substantiated accounts,\r\nnon-conflicting and extremely painful, of the various piracies,\r\ncruelties, and vexations, with which those barbarians have kept the\r\nPhilippine Islands in the south in a state of fear and depression;\r\nand needful also was it that there should have been employed, in\r\nvain, on account of the religion and the policy of our ancestors,\r\nthose gentle measures of peace and union which no civilized people\r\ncould resist; but which are ineffectual with barbarous nations who\r\nknow no other right than that of force.\r\n\r\nFrom the 14th of April, 1646, when we abandoned possession of Sulu,\r\nwhich our arms had so gloriously conquered, making a treaty of peace\r\nwhereby the Sulus bound themselves to pay us annually, as tribute,\r\nthree boatloads of unhulled rice, until the day the Government\r\nagain entered into a treaty with them, neither have the Filipinos\r\nsucceeded in freeing themselves from their harassments, nor has\r\nthe Government reaped any fruit other than continual menace. The\r\nEnglish have had the same experience with the perfidy and bad faith\r\nof those islanders. After having formed, in the island of Balambangan\r\nby a concession made by the Sulus, a settlement destined to be the\r\nemporium for the products of the East in connection with their China\r\ntrade, for which this island offers two good ports, they were two\r\nyears afterwards surprised by the Sulus themselves, who, knowing the\r\nEnglish had despatched their vessels, took advantage of their absence\r\nby taking possession of the island and the fort constructed therein,\r\nalso a great deal of booty, which cost the English East India Company\r\na loss of more than three hundred thousand dollars. In narrating\r\nthis event, Mr. J. H. Moor, who published last year a brief review\r\nof interesting events concerning the islands and lands bordering on\r\nthe China Sea, agrees with the views I have expressed, namely, that\r\nthese acts of treachery and cruelty on the part of the Sulus are the\r\noffspring of their innate love of robbery and their natural perfidy.\r\n\r\nAll these facts then will convince your Excellency that the\r\nexpectations based by my acting predecessor upon the latest treaties\r\nreferred to are too sanguine. They would produce no illusions on\r\nmy part, in view of the experience of the past, neither does it\r\nseem to me that their results, looked at with calmness and in the\r\nlight of the most exact data, could be of any great advantage to\r\nour commerce. Allowing that the treaties should be religiously\r\ncomplied with, never would they be of any value, in themselves,\r\nto improve the brutal condition of those islanders. This condition\r\nwill always constitute, not only for the Spaniards but also for all\r\ncivilized nations, a great drawback to mercantile relations, which,\r\nalthough founded on principles of utility and mutual advantage,\r\ncannot continue nor be developed except under the most favorable\r\nguaranties. How would our merchants, or the foreign merchants of Sulu\r\nobtain them, where there is neither good faith nor justice, and where\r\ncunning fraud makes even the Chinese dangerous traders? Commerce\r\nis the movement and circulation of wealth. The latter results from\r\nproduction, and production from the full and unrestricted utilization\r\nof property. Moreover, when property is insecure, when the laws do\r\nnot protect it, when the agents of the Government are the first to\r\ndisregard it, the mercantile spirit is the first to become alarmed\r\nand, when defrauded, to flee as far as possible from the place where\r\nit does not find that safe haven it requires to expand and to pursue\r\nwith skill and perseverance the objects of its calling. Thus it is\r\nthat during the period elapsed since the year cited, 1646, up to the\r\npresent time, no Spanish merchant has himself had direct dealings with\r\nthe inhabitants of Sulu, the Chinese alone being engaged in this trade,\r\nthey being the only charterers of our vessels, so that we do not obtain\r\nfrom said commerce more than interest on the capital invested, subject\r\nto great exposure and risk, which has made and always will make,\r\nthis commerce uncertain and of little value. While lack of security\r\nstill sets a limit to the extent of our speculation in commerce with\r\nSulu, lack of advantageous reciprocity adds another factor no less\r\nappreciable. At the time the Spaniards came to the Philippines, Sulu\r\nseems to have been rich in her own natural and industrial products,\r\nand richer still through the large commerce which their exchange\r\nenabled her to carry on with the Chinese vessels which in large numbers\r\nfrequented her coasts. Situated almost midway between the Philippines\r\nand the Moluccas, close to two rich islands so fertile and densely\r\npopulated as Mindanao and Borneo, it seemed destined by nature to be\r\nthe emporium of the commerce of the south. Converted to Islamism by\r\nthe Arab Sayed Ali, [287] who landed there from Mecca, how much ought\r\nthis principle of civilization in the midst of barbarous nations\r\nhave tended to their advancement! But times have changed greatly\r\nsince then, and brought their always accompanying vicissitudes. As\r\nSpanish dominion was extended in the Philippines and the Portuguese\r\npenetrated into the Moluccas, they began attracting to their capitals\r\nthe wealth and traffic that was accumulating in Sulu, and here begins\r\na new era. War and desolation, which for a period of eighty years we\r\ninflicted on them, followed, and put in our power this island and its\r\ndependencies, and though independence was later restored, it could not\r\ndivert this rich commerce from the trend it had taken. Meanwhile, their\r\nwars and internal dissensions resulted in corrupting their customs,\r\nand there only remained for them the habit of piracy, which ever since\r\nour appearance, they had embraced for the purpose of harassing us.\r\n\r\nSince then Sulu has been converted into a refuge for pirates allured\r\nby its favorable position, and these barbarians, being more solicitous\r\nof carrying on their devastations than of cultivating their land,\r\nhave not ceased to be the greatest scourge of our inhabitants of\r\nthe south. This explains the impossibility of obtaining from them by\r\nentreaty anything in the way of peace and tranquillity, which to them\r\nas well as to us would be so beneficial.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Sulu, which contains a population of pirates and\r\nslaves, is nothing more than a shipping point where certain products\r\nare collected from the other islands of the south. It is surrounded by\r\nislands and islets, which form the archipelago bearing its name, and\r\nhas a length from east to west of about ten leagues, a width of four\r\nand a half, and a circumference of thirty-two. The total population\r\ncredited to the Archipelago is from 149,000 to 150,000 souls, 6,800\r\nof which inhabit Jolo, and in this number are included 800 Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe houses, or rather huts, of the principal place, are estimated to\r\nnumber 3,500, and that of the petty king, called Sultan, cannot be\r\ndistinguished from the rest except for its greater size; all of bamboo\r\nand nipa, weak and poor as their owners, but with cannons of various\r\ncalibers which mark the residences of the datus, descendants of the\r\npetty kings, and who themselves constitute the oligarchy of their\r\nGovernment. I have already stated that the Sultan can do nothing, all\r\nmatters being decreed by the convention, or Rum Bichara of the datus,\r\nwhere the owner of the greatest number of slaves always decides the\r\nquestions. [288] Wealth, influence and power, are measured among\r\nthem solely by the number of slaves, and this is why they cannot\r\nbut be pirates, in order to acquire this wealth, nor can they offer\r\nany guaranty, if it must be accompanied by the renunciation of this\r\npursuit.\r\n\r\nBy this picture, which is corroborated by the Englishman Moor in\r\nhis description of Sulu, it will be seen that we can expect nothing\r\nfrom our present relations with Sulu in the way of securing the\r\ntranquillity and prosperity of our islands of the south. Neither\r\nis a system of continual hostility the best way of procuring these\r\nprecious gifts, but the promotion and throwing open of avenues of\r\ncommerce, directing it to one of our ports, which, in view of its\r\nposition, ought to be Zamboanga; and in this I coincide with the\r\nviews of my predecessor. Zamboanga, with a different organization,\r\nthe concession of a free port for all the products from the south and\r\nthose brought in champanes from China, and the free admission of the\r\nexiles who seek refuge there as well as the Chinese traders, aiding\r\nthe former in establishing themselves, and exempting the latter from\r\nall taxes for the first ten years, would be, in all probability, the\r\nmost suitable point to which to divert from Sulu the little transit\r\nbusiness which remains, to guard, from a shorter distance, against the\r\npiracy of its inhabitants, and to bring them in the course of time,\r\nperhaps, to a more humane mode of living.\r\n\r\nBut all this requires first the planning of a suitable and adequate\r\nsystem which, bringing nearer to the islands of the south the\r\nprotection and vigilance of the Government of the capital by means\r\nof a subordinate Government embracing its chief characteristics,\r\nwould relieve those precious islands from the calamities which up\r\nto the present time they have suffered by reason of their remoteness\r\nand possibly also because of our neglect.\r\n\r\nThis plan, which I desire to combine with a forward movement in the\r\ngreat and rich island of Mindanao, a large part of whose coast is\r\nsurrounded by the districts of the corregidors [289] of Karaga and\r\nMisamis, will bring about without doubt a new and happy era for the\r\nFilipinos of the south, and place, without the sacrifice of people\r\nor money, a large number of faithful subjects under the illustrious\r\nGovernment of her Majesty, furnishing the same also with a greater\r\nabundance of resources.\r\n\r\nTo this end I shall hold in view and faithfully observe the policy\r\nwhich her Majesty outlines in her confidential Royal order, to which\r\nI reply; its application will be the constant object of everything I\r\ndecree and execute. And very happy shall I be thus to make suitable\r\nreturn for the many proofs of co-operation and esteem, which, for the\r\npast thirteen years I have received from the Filipinos; infinitely\r\nmore so, because working at the same time for the better service of\r\nher Majesty in accordance with her Royal plans in which these people\r\nhave always found their greatest and surest well-being.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency being convinced, then, that these are the sentiments\r\nwhich impel me and the plans I contemplate for the fulfillment of the\r\nimportant duties her Majesty has deigned to confer upon me, can from\r\nthis reply assure her that as far as I am concerned, nothing shall be\r\nleft undone to carry out to the letter the policy she has been pleased\r\nto outline to me, and to merit thereby her august confidence, which\r\nI so earnestly desire. May God preserve your Excellency many years.\r\n\r\n\r\nManila, February 23, 1838.\r\n\r\nAndrés G.

She brought on board Sir\r\nJames Brooke, commissioned to make a treaty of peace and friendship\r\nbetween Great Britain and the Sultan. This treaty was presented to\r\nthe Sultan to-day in the presence of the Datus and a majority of\r\nthe people, and after being read in a loud voice it was immediately\r\napproved and ratified. I do not think it necessary to inform you\r\nas to the tenor of said treaty, as Mr. Brooke has told me that he\r\nwould go from here to your city for the purpose of communicating to\r\nyou everything regarding this matter so that you will be thoroughly\r\nacquainted with all the details. I understand that they have hastened\r\nthis matter in view of the recent advices concerning the destruction\r\nof Bali by the Dutch troops and their declared intention of taking\r\npossession of the entire coast of North Borneo, Sulu, and all its\r\ndependencies. In letters received from my partner at Singapore he\r\ntells me that it is certain they are coming, and with a large force,\r\nbut it may be not for a month or two. The people here, in view of this\r\nnews, have carried everything they have to the interior, and are ready,\r\nwhenever the Dutch arrive, to leave the town. We shall see where these\r\nthings will stop. Possibly we shall have another case like that of\r\nthe French before you leave Zamboanga. Whatever you may decide to\r\ndo when you receive this communication, you know that my services\r\nare always at your disposal, and in the event of your determining to\r\ncome, there is a house here at your disposition; and I promise you a\r\nfriendly reception on the part of the residents. It is my opinion they\r\nare in such a fright that they do not know what to do and business,\r\nof course, is entirely neglected. My brother-in-law, who is the bearer\r\nof this, will inform you in regard to what is going on. He goes to\r\nyour town to purchase rice for our house, to provide against a siege;\r\nfor rice is dear and scarce here. I remain, your obedient servant,\r\nwho kisses your hand.--Guillermo Windham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBatavia, March 20, 1849.--It appears that the expedition against Jolo\r\nis a matter fully determined upon. It is said that two steamers, two\r\nfrigates, and a corvette, operating at the present time against Bali,\r\nare in readiness to set sail the first part of July. I expect that the\r\npublishers of the Singapore paper will publish an article entitled,\r\n\"Labuan, Sarawak, the northeast coast of Borneo and the Sultan of\r\nSulu,\" by Baron Hoeveel, published in Holland in the first number\r\nof the \"Journal for Netherlands India,\" during the month of January\r\nlast, in which he informs his compatriots that if the Government of\r\nJava had followed the counsels of Resident Gronovius of Sambas in\r\n1831 or those of Resident Bloem of Sambas in 1838, they would long\r\nago have had treaties with the Sultan of Bruney which would have\r\nclosed Sarawak and the northern coast to all flags except the Dutch,\r\nand that the questions with the English Government would not have\r\narisen, but that now it is not worth while to discuss it with the\r\ncourt of St. James. England is in possession, and she will stay in\r\npossession if she considers it to her advantage. He tells them to\r\nbe on their guard, because if they do not have a care the English\r\nwill make another move; and he indicates the point which calls for\r\nimmediate and indispensable protection, namely, the northeast coast\r\nof Borneo: that is to say, from Sampan Manjee Point to the Cape of\r\nKamongan (the Straits of Makassar), which he says are tributary to the\r\nSultan of Sulu. He gives information concerning the different stations\r\nfor the principal departments: Malsedu (or Kinabalu), Manjedore and\r\nTiroen, designating the bay of Sandakan for the first establishment,\r\nas soon as they have taken possession of this side. He enumerates\r\nthe products of this part of the world: the pearls, the diamonds,\r\nthe iron and gold mines, the birds'-nests, the trepang, etc.; so that\r\nhe has strongly influenced the minds of the Dutch. And he concludes\r\nby stating that in the next article of his paper he will discuss the\r\nSultan's possession in relation to the government of the Dutch Indies,\r\noffering some suggestions as to how his countrymen may avail themselves\r\nof the advantages of this rich territory. It is a truly interesting\r\narticle and appears to me no less curious than reasonable. The editor\r\nof the Journal of the Eastern Archipelago will do a good service to\r\nhis countrymen by making a translation of it, but it must be done\r\nvery soon. I am too busy to write a paper of such length, otherwise\r\nit would have given me pleasure to send you one for your own use. I\r\nreiterate the necessity for despatch, for I really believe that\r\nthe Dutch government will work for its own interests in accordance\r\nwith the plans which the Baron has marked out. The English will not\r\nrelish the idea of their oriental Government sleeping and permitting\r\nthe Sultan to make, under coercion, a treaty such as must be made in\r\norder to forward the plans of Van Hoeveel. The vessels of the King\r\nof the Low Countries, the \"Prince of Orange,\" \"Sambi,\" and \"Argo,\"\r\nwith five others, set sail on the 15th of this month, transporting\r\n1,800 men in the direction of Bali. Afterwards they are to carry to\r\nSurabaya, on the 25th proximo, 5,000 men more, besides from 2,500 to\r\n3,000 coolies, 12 cannon, 2 mortars, etc., etc. Receive, etc.\r\n\r\nThese are notices taken from a letter to hand, from a trustworthy\r\nperson in Singapore.--Figueroa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary and Civil Government, Plaza de Zamboanga.--No. 101.--\r\nDepartment  of Government.--Excellent Sir:--Notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat the lieutenant governor of this province informs me that he\r\ntranscribed and forwarded to your Excellency, while he was in charge\r\nof the civil government during my absence in Malusu, the letter which\r\nMr. William Windham, a merchant of Jolo, sent me under date of May\r\n28th, it seems to me well to send the original to your Excellency,\r\nwhich I now do, retaining a copy of it for the purpose of reference\r\nat any time. As your Excellency may note if he will compare its\r\ncontents with the text of the treaty of the 29th of the same month\r\nof May, made with the Sultan of Sulu by the English Consul-General\r\nto Borneo, Sir James Brooke, there is, between the terms of the former\r\nand the spirit of Article 7 of the latter, a notable lack of agreement;\r\nwherefore it has not seemed to me well to place entire confidence in\r\nthe offer of Windham, who may be suspected of partiality, and I have\r\nconcluded, therefore, to move in such a delicate matter with all\r\npossible tact and foresight and in accordance with developments, which\r\nmay become extremely complicated. Considering the great interest\r\nwhich the agents of the English Government show in these questions\r\nconcerning Sulu and the part of Borneo subject to the Sultan, I\r\nimmediately suspected that the announcement of the imminent arrival\r\nof a considerable Dutch force in the archipelago was only a strategem\r\nto obtain, through surprise and fear, the realization of the agreement\r\nor treaty referred to; but it having been possible for me to secure\r\nfresh data through a different channel, confirming those which Windham\r\nfurnished me,--which latter I obtained through Mr. Brooke and the\r\ncaptain of the \"Nemesis,\" and herewith transmit to your Excellency,--\r\nI am of the opinion now that the expedition of the Dutch to Jolo is an\r\nenterprise fully determined upon, although it may very well be delayed\r\nor postponed by fortuitous circumstances difficult to foresee. In the\r\nevent of the appearance of the Dutch expedition, I shall never believe\r\nthat it is with the object of confining its field of action to\r\npunishing the place of residence of the Sultan in a more thorough\r\nmanner than was done in the attempt made in April of last year; but\r\nthat they intend to conquer and occupy the Island and its dependencies.\r\nIf this should be so, I am equally of the opinion that the Government\r\nof your Excellency, notwithstanding its conspicuous firmness and\r\nwell-known energy, will not succeed in getting them to recede from\r\ntheir purpose, as everything goes to show they have determined to\r\ncarry it out in the face--most assuredly--of our known and declared\r\nrights and claims to the rule of that land. I venture, therefore, to\r\nbelieve that the only way to prevent the serious detriment which would\r\nresult to this colony, under the wise and worthy government of your\r\nExcellency, from the occupation of Sulu, avoiding at the same time a\r\nconflict between the Spanish and Dutch Governments, respectively, would\r\nbe, by means of persuasion and by taking advantage of the state of\r\nextreme alarm now existing in Sulu, to anticipate them by a recognition\r\nof the sovereignty of Spain, floating our national flag under\r\nguaranties which would make impossible (without manifest violence) this\r\nproposed unprecedented aggression. I am convinced that besides flying\r\nthe national flag and having the sovereignty of Spain recognized in a\r\nformal manner, the principal guaranty must be--and I shall require it\r\nunconditionally--that they shall agree to let us garrison with Spanish\r\ntroops the principal fort of Sulu, the residence of the Sultan. To this\r\nend I have decided to embark in the pilot boat \"Pasig\" and make my way\r\nto Jolo without delay, where, if I do not obtain the results which I\r\nhave here set forth, it will certainly not be through lack of zeal and\r\nactivity, but through encountering obstacles beyond my control or\r\ninfluence, and owing to difficulties incident to the temperament of\r\nthose people and the ancient prejudices which, owing to a series of\r\nevents stretching through centuries, they feel towards us, as is only\r\ntoo well known to your Excellency. To aid me in these operations and\r\nto meet possible contingencies--since there will be needed there, in\r\ncase of success, an expert and trustworthy officer--and to carry out\r\nreconnaissances and make plans which cannot fail to be always of the\r\ngreatest usefulness to the government at Manila, I shall invite the\r\nchief of engineers of this place, Don Emilio Bernaldez, to accompany\r\nme, if the exigencies of the service do not demand his presence here\r\nand at Pasanhan. All of which I have the honor to lay before your\r\nExcellency in the hope that it may merit your entire approval. May God\r\npreserve your Excellency many years.\r\n\r\n\r\nZamboanga, June 8, 1849.\r\n\r\nCayetano Figueroa.\r\n\r\nHis high Excellency the Governor and Captain-General of these\r\nPhilippine Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOffice of the Secretary of the Governor and Captain-General of the\r\nPhilippines.\r\n\r\nZamboanga, June 5th, 1849.--Mr. Consul-General:--I have the honor\r\nto inform you that from notices received from Jolo, it has come to\r\nmy knowledge that during your stay there with the steamer \"Nemesis\"\r\nyou negotiated a commercial treaty with the Sultan Mohammed Pulalun;\r\nand as I am entirely ignorant of its essential clauses, and as my\r\nGovernment has for a long time past, and especially of late, been\r\nin possession or enjoyment through solemn treaties, the first made\r\nwith the Malay chiefs, masters of the coasts of Sulu, of the right\r\nthat our commercial flag be at least as privileged as any other; and\r\nin view of the indisputable rights which Spain has to the territory\r\nin question, rights not merely of prescription; I have the honor to\r\nrequest, in view of the close friendship which unites our respective\r\nGovernments and which I honor myself in maintaining, that you have\r\nthe kindness to give me, officially, knowledge of the said treaty and\r\na copy thereof in order that I may forward it to the most excellent,\r\nthe Governor-General of these Philippine Islands, without prejudice\r\nto my making before you, if the spirit of any of these articles\r\nso requires, the remonstrances that may be necessary to uphold the\r\nrights of Spain.--Receive, Mr. Consul-General, the assurance of my\r\nconsideration, etc.\r\n\r\nC. de Figueroa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Sir James Brooke, Consul-General of her Britannic Majesty in Borneo\r\nand Governor of Labuan.\r\n\r\n\r\nH. M. S. \"Nemesis,\" June 3rd, 1849.--Sir:--I have the honor to reply\r\nto your communication of this date; and as the quickest way to furnish\r\nyour Excellency with the information desired, I enclose herewith a copy\r\nof the agreement recently made with the Government of Sulu. It would be\r\nunprofitable to discuss at this time the rights of Spain to which you\r\nmake allusion, and the interests of Great Britain, which are involved,\r\nbut as the best means of preserving the cordial relations which should\r\nalways exist between the public servants of our respective governments,\r\nI propose to forward our present correspondence to the Secretary of\r\nForeign Affairs of her Britannic Majesty. Nevertheless, permit me to\r\nsay that my opinion is that the interests of Spain and of Great Britain\r\nin these seas should be considered entirely harmonious and equally\r\nopposed to any system of oppression or of monopoly.--I have the honor\r\nto be, with the greatest consideration, Sir, Your obedient servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrooke, Commissioner and Consul-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo His Excellency C. de Figueroa, Governor of Zamboanga.\r\n\r\n\r\nHer Majesty, the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nIreland, desirous of encouraging commerce between her subjects and\r\nthose of the independent princes in the Eastern seas, and of putting\r\nan end to the piracy which has up to this time hindered said commerce:\r\nand his Highness the Sultan Mohammed Pulalun who occupies the throne\r\nand governs the territories of Sulu, animated by like sentiments\r\nand desirous of co-operating in the measures which may be necessary\r\nfor the achievement of the objects mentioned; have resolved to place\r\non record their determination on these points by an agreement which\r\ncontains the following articles: Article 1. From now on there shall\r\nbe peace, friendship, and good understanding between her Majesty\r\nthe Queen of Great Britain and Ireland and his Highness Mohammed\r\nPulalun, Sultan of Sulu, and between their respective heirs and\r\nsuccessors, and between their subjects. Article 2. The subjects of\r\nher Britannic Majesty shall have complete liberty to enter, reside,\r\ncarry on business, and pass with their merchandise through all parts\r\nof the dominions of his Highness the Sultan of Sulu, and they shall\r\nenjoy in them all the privileges and advantages with respect to\r\ncommerce or in connection with any other matter whatever which are\r\nat this time enjoyed by, or which in the future may be granted to,\r\nthe subjects or citizens of the most favored nation; and the subjects\r\nof his Highness the Sultan of Sulu shall likewise be free to enter,\r\nreside, carry on business, and pass with their merchandise to all parts\r\nof the dominions of her Britannic Majesty, in Europe as well as in\r\nAsia, as freely as the subjects of the most favored nation, and they\r\nshall enjoy in said dominions all the privileges and advantages with\r\nrespect to commerce and in connection with other matters which are now\r\nenjoyed by, or which in the future may be granted to, the subjects or\r\ncitizens of the most favored nation. Article 3. British subjects shall\r\nbe permitted to buy, lease, or acquire in any lawful way whatever all\r\nkinds of property within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of\r\nSulu; and his Highness extends, as far as lies within his power, to\r\nevery British subject who establishes himself in his dominions, the\r\nenjoyment of entire and complete protection and security to person\r\nand to property--as well any property which in the future may be\r\nacquired, as that which has already been acquired prior to the date\r\nof this agreement. Article 4. His Highness the Sultan of Sulu offers\r\nto allow the war vessels of her Britannic Majesty and those of the\r\nIndia Company to enter freely the ports, rivers, and inlets situated\r\nwithin his dominions and to permit said vessels to supply themselves,\r\nat reasonable prices, with the goods and provisions which they may\r\nneed from time to time. Article 5. If any English vessel should\r\nbe lost on the coasts of the dominions of his Highness the Sultan\r\nof Sulu the latter promises to lend every aid in his power for the\r\nrecovery and delivery to the owners of everything than can be saved\r\nfrom said vessels; and his Highness also promises to give entire\r\nprotection to the officers and crew and to every person who may be\r\naboard the shipwrecked vessel, as well as to their property. Article\r\n6. Therefore, her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland, and the Sultan of Sulu, bind themselves to adopt\r\nsuch measures as lie within their power to suppress piracy within\r\nthe seas, islands, and rivers under their respective jurisdiction\r\nor influence, and his Highness the Sultan of Sulu binds himself not\r\nto harbor or protect any person or vessel engaged in enterprises of\r\na piratical nature. Article 7. His Highness the Sultan of Sulu, for\r\nthe purpose of avoiding in the future any occasion for disagreement,\r\npromises to make no cession of territory within his dominions to any\r\nother nation, nor to subjects or citizens thereof, nor to acknowledge\r\nvassalage or feudality to any other power without the consent of her\r\nBritannic Majesty. Article 8. This treaty must be ratified, and the\r\nratifications will therefore be exchanged in Jolo within two years\r\nfrom date. Home Copy.--Brooke.--Approved, etc.--Signed and sealed\r\nMay 29, 1849.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZamboanga, June 5, 1849.--Mr. Consul-General:--I have received the\r\nletter which you have done me the honor to send under date of the day\r\nbefore yesterday in reply to mine, and I acknowledge receipt of copy of\r\nthe treaty which you negotiated with his Highness the Sultan of Sulu\r\non the 29th May last. I have no remarks to make, Mr. Consul-General,\r\nwith respect to the first six articles of the treaty, for the\r\nclauses they contain are not of such an urgent character that my\r\nGovernment cannot postpone their discussion if it so deems advisable;\r\nbut I might perhaps create in the future serious embarrassment to our\r\nrespective Governments should I allow Article 7 to pass unnoticed. It\r\nestablishes two principles of the most vital importance: (1st) His\r\nHighness the Sultan binds himself to recognize the sovereignty of no\r\npower without previously notifying her Britannic Majesty; and (2nd)\r\nto make, likewise, no cession of the least portion of the territory\r\nof his dominions to any State, person or corporation. With relation\r\nto the first point, and waiving for the moment the question whether,\r\nbecause the Sultan is in possession, with slight exceptions, of the\r\ncoast of Sulu, this island must be regarded as his exclusive domain,\r\nit is my duty, Mr. Consul-General, to inform you that for a long time\r\npast the said Sultan of Sulu has admitted and acknowledged himself\r\nto be under the protection of her Catholic Majesty, recognizing the\r\nsovereignty of Spain in a public way and in official documents which\r\nhis Excellency the Governor-General of these Philippine Islands will\r\nbe able to produce at the proper time and place. As regards the second\r\npoint: I find no objection to the pledge of his Highness having all the\r\nforce of free right with respect to those parts of his dominions lying\r\noutside of the island of Sulu, namely, the north and northeast part of\r\nBorneo, now under the rule of the Sultan; but under no circumstances\r\nwith respect to the said island of Sulu and its neighboring islands;\r\nfor not only can Spain not recognize in any power the right to\r\nintervene in the matter of ceding or not ceding the island of Sulu\r\nand its surrounding islands, as it is claimed can be done according\r\nto the terms of Article 7 of the Treaty; but Spain does not recognize\r\nthis right even in the Sultan and Datus of Sulu, because, as I have\r\nhad the honor to inform you, Mr. Consul-General, these territories\r\nbelong to Spain, by a right not prescribed, by a right in no way\r\nestablished by the conquest of this archipelago, but positively\r\nthrough the willing submission of the real natives, the Gimbahans,\r\nwho do now, and who at the end of the 17th century did, constitute\r\nthe most numerous portion of its population, whose oppressors were\r\nthen and are now the Sultan and Datus, Malay Mussulmans. At this very\r\ntime the chief of the Gimbahans, this unfortunate and enslaved race,\r\ncherishes with respect and veneration his loving remembrance of Spain\r\nand holds in his possession the proofs of what I assert. This fact\r\nestablished, Mr. Consul-General, I am forcibly constrained to protest,\r\nwhich I accordingly do, against every claim in its favor by your nation\r\non the terms of the said Article 7 of the treaty referred to of May\r\n29th of the present year, since it prejudices the incontestable and\r\nrecognized rights of the crown of Spain to the sovereignty of the\r\nterritory of the island of Sulu and its surrounding islands, and to\r\nits sovereignty over the present possessors of the coasts of this\r\narchipelago, begging that you will kindly acknowledge receipt of this\r\nletter in order to cover my responsibility to my Government. Receive,\r\nagain, Mr. Consul-General, the assurances, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. de Figueroa.\r\n\r\nTo Sir James Brooke, Consul-General for her Britannic Majesty in\r\nBorneo and Governor of Labuan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nH.

Aboard the vessel was Sir\r\nJames Brooke, Consul-General for his country in Borneo and Governor\r\nof Labuan; and as a result of a long conference I had with the latter\r\ngentleman in regard to recent events in Sulu--which conference it\r\nwas agreed to continue in this place immediately upon my arrival\r\nhere--I gave him, successively, the two communications of which I\r\nattach copies; with them I send to your Excellency letters dated the\r\n3rd and 5th instant replying to mine in terms that your Excellency\r\nwill see embodied in the two original letters of corresponding dates,\r\nwhich I likewise enclose herewith, retaining copies of them, as also\r\nan authorized copy of the treaty or agreement of the 29th of last\r\nMay, also enclosed; feeling confident that the indulgence of your\r\nExcellency will approve my action in this delicate matter.

The communications of her\r\nMajesty's Consul in Singapore and his confidential correspondence with\r\nthe Governor-General of Java, which he has forwarded to the Secretary\r\nof State, show that the Dutch Government wishes to maintain the most\r\nfriendly relations with Spain. Although the English press in Singapore\r\nand Hong-Kong are still speaking of a Dutch expedition against Jolo,\r\nnothing has been done hitherto, and the favorable season for such an\r\nexpedition has passed.\r\n\r\nAs the correspondence between Brooke and the Governor of Zamboanga will\r\nprobably play an important part in the future correspondence with the\r\nBritish Government, I believe it is my duty to submit a few remarks in\r\nregard to the action taken by the said Governor. Notwithstanding that\r\nthe objections, which he submitted to Brooke in regard to Article 7\r\nof the treaty, were well founded, he ought not to have entered upon\r\nsuch a discussion, and much less to have particularized it in such\r\na way: he ought to have protested against the treaty as a whole,\r\nand to have declared it null, as made without the consent of Spain,\r\nwhich holds not only a protectorate, but sovereignty or dominion over\r\nthe territory. The second defect that I find in the same letter to\r\nBrooke, is his basing our right to the sovereignty over Sulu on the\r\n\"free submission of the true natives of the Gimbahan race, who live\r\nin the interior of the island and are oppressed by the Sultan and the\r\nDatus.\" Although there is some truth in that statement, and we might\r\ntake advantage of this element in case of a war with the Sultan,\r\nI believe that it ought not to have been made under the present\r\ncircumstances, as, on the same principle, we would invalidate the\r\nrights founded by us on the different treaties made by Spain with the\r\nSultan and Datus of Sulu. The acknowledgment made by the latter of the\r\nsovereignty of Spain during over two centuries and more especially in\r\nthe treaties of 1646, 1737 and 1836, by the first of which they pledge\r\nthemselves to pay, as vassals, a tribute of three boatloads of rice,\r\nas recorded in the Archives, is a powerful argument in favor of our\r\nrights, which the Sultan has often confirmed in his communications\r\nto this Government and in the passports which he gives his subjects,\r\non printed forms supplied by my predecessor;--I enclose herewith a\r\ncopy of one of said passports.\r\n\r\nThe British, who doubtless do not feel very certain about their rights,\r\ntry to excuse their conduct through the press, as they did when they\r\noccupied Labuan by force. The Singapore Free Press of the 6th of July\r\npublished an article in which it alleges, for the purpose of proving\r\nthat Sulu has always been considered as a sovereign independent power,\r\nthat we said nothing to England when she accepted the cession of the\r\nisland of Balambangan, between Borneo and Palawan. Even supposing\r\nthe fact to be true, there would be nothing astonishing about it,\r\nconsidering the distress and the lack of means of the Government\r\nat that time, after the war which, but a few years before, it had\r\nmiraculously carried on against the English who held Manila and many\r\nother places in the islands, and the work it had to do in order to\r\nput down interior rebellions, to reorganize the administration and to\r\nreëstablish normal conditions in the provinces which had been left\r\nuncontrolled during four years and had suffered the consequences of\r\ncircumstances so unfortunate. Furthermore, the cession of Balambangan\r\ncannot be considered as an act of free will on the part of the Sulus,\r\nsince they took advantage of the first opportunity to drive the British\r\noff the island, when they had hardly started to firmly establish\r\ntheir trading posts. The newspaper also mentions the doctrine\r\nof Walter, which says that an agreement similar to that existing\r\nbetween the Spanish and Sulu Governments does not entirely derogate\r\nthe sovereignty of the protected state, which can make treaties and\r\ncontract alliances, except when it has expressly renounced its right\r\nto do so; and that if the first state fails to protect the other, the\r\ntreaty is invalidated; the author of the article adds that this is our\r\ncase, since we allowed the Dutch to attack Sulu without interfering,\r\nor, as far as known, requiring a reparation or the assurance that\r\nsuch an attack would not be renewed.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the first point, the reference to Walter is correct,\r\nbut Walter adds in the same paragraph that \"the protected nation is\r\nbound forever by the treaty of protection, so that it can undertake\r\nno engagements which would be contrary to said treaty, that is to say,\r\nthat would violate any of the express conditions of the protectorate,\r\nor be inconsistent with any treaty of the said class:\" how then\r\ncould Article 7 of the treaty made by Brooke be valid, when by said\r\narticle the Sultan pledges himself to recognize the sovereignty of\r\nno power without the previous consent of her Britannic Majesty, and\r\nnot to cede the smallest part of the territory of his dominions to any\r\nstate, person or corporation, said Sultan having already recognized the\r\nsovereignty of Spain and the rights of the latter over the greater part\r\nof his territory, in which the island of Palawan, which was ceded to\r\nus in the last century by the kings of Bruney is included by mistake.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the second point, the author of the article is also in\r\nthe wrong: for this Government was neither aware of the intentions\r\nof the Dutch, nor was its assistance requested by the Sultan; and\r\nyour Excellency knows in what terms I wrote to the Governor-General\r\nof Java about that matter.--If I have given so many details, despite\r\ntheir not being new to your Excellency it is because the article of the\r\nSingapore Free Press may have been inspired by the British Government,\r\nand deserves therefore not to be left unnoticed.\r\n\r\nIn the event of which I am writing, your Excellency will see the\r\nfulfilment of my predictions, and it may perhaps be only the prelude\r\nof events of still greater importance.\r\n\r\nThus I cannot but earnestly recommend to your Excellency's notice\r\nthe necessity that the Governor of the Philippines have very\r\ndetailed instructions or very ample powers to proceed as regards\r\nthe Southern regions in accordance with what he believes best\r\nsuited to her Majesty's interests and to the security of these rich\r\npossessions. In this connection I take the liberty of recommending to\r\nyour Excellency such action as our Sovereign the Queen may deem most\r\nwise on my communication (consulta) number 359 and others relative\r\nto the same subject.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, as I mentioned in my communication of the 4th of July last,\r\nthe only advantageous issue for us would be to send a strong expedition\r\nand to occupy Jolo, our action being warranted by the piratical acts\r\ncommitted by several small boats of Bwal, Sulu; the Dutch may avail\r\nthemselves of the same excuse and send an expedition before us, if,\r\nas is possible, other pancos [292] [Moro boats] have gone south for\r\nthe same purpose; but anyhow the behavior of the Sultan and Datus of\r\nSulu would give us excellent reasons for taking action against them\r\nat any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nGod keep your Excellency many years.\r\n\r\nManila, August 16, 1849.\r\n\r\nThe Count of Manila.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency, the Secretary of State and \"Gobernación.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XVIII\r\n\r\nREGULATIONS RELATIVE TO TAXES AND IMPOSTS ON NATIVES AND IMMIGRANTS\r\nIN SULU [293]\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Government of the Philippines, Treasury Department, Manila,\r\nFebruary 24th, 1877.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of the communications of the politico-military governor\r\nof Sulu of October 6th of last year, in which he suggests to this\r\ngeneral government the concession of various exemptions in favor of\r\nthe natives of these islands and of any Chinamen who shall establish\r\nthemselves in the said place, to the end that by this means there may\r\nbe promoted the immigration which the interests of that island demand:\r\n\r\nIn view of the reports issued in the premises by the central\r\nadministration of imposts, the office of the insular auditor, [294] and\r\nthe insular departments of civil administration and the treasury: and\r\n\r\nDeeming it expedient, for the realization of the high purposes that\r\nrequired the military occupation of Jolo and for the progressive\r\nand efficacious development of the moral and material interests of\r\nthis young colony, that there should be granted certain exemptions\r\nfor the encouragement of the immigration thereto of the greatest\r\npossible number of inhabitants: this office of the general government\r\nin conformity with the suggestions made by the treasury department,\r\nand in accordance with the statements made by the department of civil\r\nadministration, disposes the following:\r\n\r\n1. All immigrants to the island of Sulu, of whatever class, race,\r\nor nationality, who shall establish themselves definitively in the\r\nsame, engaging in agricultural, industrial, or commercial pursuits,\r\nor in any art, trade, or occupation, shall be exempt during ten years\r\nfrom all the contributions or taxes imposed, or which in the future\r\nmay be imposed, upon the inhabitants of the Philippine Archipelago.\r\n\r\n2. The children of immigrants to Sulu, born in said island or who\r\nestablish themselves there before becoming taxpayers in the pueblos\r\nof their birth, shall commence to pay taxes at the age of twenty-five\r\nyears, but shall be exempt from military service so long as they\r\nreside in the said island.\r\n\r\nThis decree shall be published in the Official Gazette and communicated\r\nto the council of administration, the office of the captain-general,\r\nand the insular department of civil administration; and shall be\r\nreturned to the treasury department for such further action as may\r\nbe proper.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Malcampo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Government of the Philippines, Treasury Department, Manila,\r\nAugust 10, 1887.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of the investigation conducted by the intendant-general\r\nof the treasury with the object of determining whether it would be\r\nexpedient to prolong the term of exemption from all kinds of taxes\r\nand imposts in favor of natives and of immigrants of whatever race or\r\nnationality who are established, or who shall establish themselves,\r\nin Sulu for the purpose of engaging in any kind of industry, commerce,\r\nprofession, art, or trade, or in agriculture:\r\n\r\nIn view of the reports issued by the said directive bureau of the\r\ntreasury and the politico-military governor of Sulu:\r\n\r\nAnd considering that exemption from all burdens constitutes one of\r\nthe most efficacious means of encouraging the immigration demanded by\r\nthe interest of the archipelago in question; this general government,\r\nin conformity with the suggestions made by the office of the intendant\r\nof the treasury and the politico-military governor of Sulu, disposes\r\nthat the term of exemption granted by superior decree of this general\r\ngovernment of February 24th, 1877, shall be understood as extended\r\nfor another term of ten years, the said extension to be reckoned\r\nfrom the day following that on which the first term expires, that is,\r\nfrom the 25th day of February of the current year.\r\n\r\nThis decree shall be published in the Official Gazette; the Government\r\nof his Majesty shall be informed thereof and a copy of the records\r\ntransmitted; it shall be communicated to the council of administration,\r\nthe tribunal of accounts, the office of the Captain-General, and the\r\ninsular department of civil administration; and shall be returned to\r\nthe office of the intendant of the treasury for any further action\r\nthat may be proper.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Terrero.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOffice of the Governor-General of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nMost excellent and most illustrious Sir: The politico-military governor\r\nof Sulu, in a communication dated the 9th instant, states as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Most excellent Sir: As the time expiration of the exemptions\r\n    granted to Sulu and its port by decree of the general government\r\n    under the able direction of your Excellency, dated February 24th,\r\n    1877, and extended by superior order issued from the same office\r\n    for another term of ten years, on August 23rd, 1887, is drawing\r\n    near, the person who has the honor to sign hereunder believes\r\n    that the moment has come to call the attention of your Excellency\r\n    to the matter, and he takes the liberty to set down some remarks\r\n    in the premises, to the end that when your Excellency determines\r\n    what is deemed most expedient, they may be taken under advisement.\r\n\r\n    In the exemptions granted to Sulu, it must be borne in mind that\r\n    they affect two distinct elements, which constitute the life\r\n    and favor the development of this locality. Some have reference\r\n    to the exemption from all taxes, tributes, and gabels imposed,\r\n    or to be imposed, in favor of natives or foreigners taking up\r\n    their abode in the Sulu archipelago. Others refer exclusively\r\n    to the declaration of a free port, with exemption from all taxes\r\n    and customs formalities in favor of the capital of the island.\r\n\r\n    In treating this question and in considering what ought to be done\r\n    in the future, when the moment arrives for determining whether\r\n    a fresh extension is expedient, or whether, on the contrary,\r\n    this territory must enter upon the normal administrative life\r\n    general in other localities of the Philippine Archipelago,\r\n    the subject must be dealt with under the two aspects above\r\n    set forth. In regard to the declaration of freedom of the port\r\n    granted to Jolo, it is undoubtedly expedient to continue it for\r\n    the present without change. So long as the protocol entered into\r\n    with the other nations who are parties thereto, continues in\r\n    force--in which protocol our incontestable right of sovereignty\r\n    over this archipelago, with the limitations therein stipulated,\r\n    is declared--it would be highly impolitic to close the period\r\n    of franchise granted to this port. Should there be established\r\n    the embarrassing obstacles and difficulties to commerce entailed\r\n    by the formalities of customs regulations, the English steamers\r\n    which now carry on the trade with Singapore, would immediately\r\n    cease to visit this port and would make their destination some\r\n    other port of the island, where, under the provisions of the\r\n    protocol above referred to, no one could lawfully obstruct them\r\n    until after the effective occupation of the new port selected for\r\n    trading operations, and until after having allowed to elapse the\r\n    requisite time subsequent to publishing this resolution in the\r\n    official papers of the Peninsula. The distinguished intelligence\r\n    of your Excellency will perceive easily that after this had been\r\n    repeated several times, we should find ourselves compelled either\r\n    to occupy effectively all the islands of the Sulu archipelago where\r\n    English steamers might attempt to establish their business, or,\r\n    in the end, to allow them to carry on their commercial operations\r\n    at any place that suited them, which, without doubt, would be much\r\n    more prejudicial than what happens at the present time; for, at\r\n    any rate, so long as steamers come exclusively to this port or to\r\n    that of Siasi, as is the case at present, the trade can be watched\r\n    easily and conveniently and without the commercial operations which\r\n    are carried on giving rise to diplomatic questions; it is easy,\r\n    also to prevent the traffic of arms and war supplies, which would\r\n    not be the case if they touched at other points where our sphere of\r\n    action is not so direct and effective. Furthermore, the advantages\r\n    of the present situation must also be taken into account. So long\r\n    as these steamers touch only at Jolo and Siasi, as happens now,\r\n    these two points are the only markets, whither all the people of\r\n    the archipelago must necessarily go to trade, not only to supply\r\n    themselves with the effects which they import and are necessary\r\n    to life, but also to sell all the products they gather in their\r\n    fields and in the seas, which constitute the element of commerce\r\n    that justifies English vessels in visiting these regions, making it\r\n    possible to collect sufficient freight to maintain the two regular\r\n    lines now established. It is obvious that, since we are masters\r\n    of the towns of Jolo and Siasi--the only points of distribution\r\n    for effects necessary to the life of the natives here--we can,\r\n    when we consider it expedient, prevent the sale of these effects\r\n    to the villages hostile to the city, a most momentous advantage\r\n    resulting therefrom and a means of government of inestimable\r\n    value. So long as the Moros have to supply themselves from these\r\n    markets, our importance is incontestable; all their outbreaks\r\n    are easily checked without appeal to violent methods; and the\r\n    civilizing effect which results from the constant intercourse\r\n    which is necessitated by their coming to the occupied ports, is\r\n    extended, thereby modifying the sanguinary and turbulent habits of\r\n    this race. If the revenues from the duties which would be imposed\r\n    were of sufficient importance to cover the expenses entailed by\r\n    the occupation of Sulu, the arguments supporting the opinion\r\n    above expressed could easily be set aside. But unfortunately\r\n    there can not be expected from the custom house of Jolo, in the\r\n    event of its establishment, even the expenses necessary to cover\r\n    the salaries of the personnel engaged therein. For, the foreign\r\n    steamers which now visit this port would immediately discontinue\r\n    their voyages, and even though it were possible to prevent them\r\n    from making port at some other place for the purpose of carrying\r\n    on their mercantile operations--a thing which would not be easy so\r\n    long as the treaty is in force--what would happen? Why, that the\r\n    trade would be continued by means of smaller boats which would\r\n    come from Borneo, and it would not be feasible to prevent this\r\n    except by the posting of a very large number of coastguards along\r\n    the shores of the innumerable islands of Sulu, a method which\r\n    it would be altogether impossible to adopt. It is, therefore,\r\n    unquestionably expedient to maintain the present status, whether\r\n    the matter be considered under its economic aspect or under that\r\n    of the policy it is necessary to develop in this territory. A\r\n    very different course must, in the opinion of the undersigned,\r\n    be followed in the matter of the exemption from taxation granted\r\n    to the inhabitants of Sulu. These exists here a numerous Chinese\r\n    colony, which is the element that really enjoys the benefit of\r\n    the advantages flowing from the present free-port conditions,\r\n    and it is neither just nor equitable that, while the Chinese find\r\n    in us the support and protection which enable them to carry on\r\n    and develop the trade in which they alone engage, they should not\r\n    contribute in any way towards the expenses of the Government which\r\n    furnishes them so many advantages. It is, therefore, expedient\r\n    to impose upon all Chinaman residing in the Sulu territory the\r\n    obligation to pay the same taxes as are paid by those of the same\r\n    race in other parts of the Philippines. The establishment of this\r\n    system promises not only the profit of the sums which would be\r\n    collected as a consequence thereof, but also the desideratum of\r\n    introducing order into the anarchical manner of life obtaining\r\n    among the Chinese here. As soon as the obligation to pay taxes\r\n    is imposed upon all and the lists of tax-payers are made up,\r\n    individual interest will see to it that all persons living in\r\n    the country are included therein; for it is unquestionable that,\r\n    since each desires to be placed under the same conditions as the\r\n    other, the Chinamen themselves will be of very great assistance\r\n    in discovering those who now are not included in the incomplete\r\n    and untrustworthy census lists existing in the offices of the\r\n    Government of Sulu. It is believed, then, that it is expedient\r\n    and just to discontinue the franchise now enjoyed by the Chinese\r\n    here, and that they should begin to contribute at once towards\r\n    defraying the expenses of the treasury, paying at least as much as\r\n    is paid by their countrymen in other parts of the Philippines. It\r\n    would appear also equitable that the Indians residing here should\r\n    also begin to pay the cédulas [295] of the class to which they\r\n    respectively belong; but there must be borne in mind the limited\r\n    number of individuals of this race residing here; the expediency\r\n    of encouraging by this means the immigration of fresh residents;\r\n    and, above all, the services they render in any case of alarm,\r\n    whether caused by juramentados or by more serious aggressions\r\n    attempted against the city; all of which circumstances make it\r\n    proper that they should continue enjoying the exemption from\r\n    the payment of poll-tax which they now enjoy, as also exemption\r\n    from all the other taxes upon the insignificant industries from\r\n    which they gain a subsistence. The treasury could not hope for\r\n    any happy results in this direction; and, on the other hand, if\r\n    such a tax were imposed, the place would, in a very short time,\r\n    be left entirely without any civilian population; for only with\r\n    difficulty, and thanks to the franchises, can persons be found\r\n    who will face the constant danger in which residents in Jolo are\r\n    placed--especially those who engage in the cultivation of the\r\n    soil in the outskirts of the town; of which class the civilian\r\n    population is, in a very large majority, composed.\r\n\r\n    It remains, only, most excellent Sir, to discuss the expediency,\r\n    or otherwise, of establishing taxation upon commerce, industry,\r\n    and property. All the urban property of Jolo is in the hands of\r\n    the Chinese, with so few exceptions that there are not more than\r\n    three property holders who do not belong to that race. In their\r\n    hands is all the commerce, with the sole exception of two Spanish\r\n    houses: every thing relating to business is in their power; so\r\n    that any burden imposed in this direction would not be borne by\r\n    them, but would be paid by the garrison of Jolo. For, united as\r\n    the Chinamen are in every thing that relates to the avoidance of\r\n    tax-paying, they would come to a perfect understanding to surtax\r\n    every thing,--not in the same proportion as the contributions\r\n    they would pay, but with a considerable increase, with the\r\n    result that the only tax-payer to the treasury and for the\r\n    Chinaman would be the unfortunate inhabitant of Jolo. And since\r\n    the population here consists almost entirely of the garrison,\r\n    which renders such arduous services at this place, I believe\r\n    that it would not be just to add to the other disadvantages that\r\n    the service here offers, the very serious one that would result\r\n    from the imposition of taxes in this capital. Furthermore, one\r\n    must not lose sight of what might happen or rather what would\r\n    immediately happen, when, by taxing the commerce of the city,\r\n    the majority of the Chinamen now established here would go to\r\n    Maymbung, with a tendency to store their merchandise at other\r\n    important points in the island, in which places our rule is, it\r\n    may be said, nominal, and it is unnecessary to insist upon the\r\n    undesirable consequences that would follow; for we should return\r\n    to the condition in which Maymbung stood in April of the year\r\n    1887, when this town was a very important center of resistence\r\n    to our rule, due to the facility afforded in that place for the\r\n    purchase of unlimited arms and ammunition, a business carried\r\n    on by the foreign steamers who anchored there at that time. And\r\n    all this without taking into account the undesirability, from a\r\n    political point of view, of affording the Moros the opportunity\r\n    of purchasing their supplies at prices lower than those in this\r\n    city; since, if the merchants in that town did not pay taxes\r\n    they would be able to sell at lower prices than those in the\r\n    capital. Summing up what I have stated above and recapitulating\r\n    the questions herein treated, I will conclude by submitting to\r\n    the distinguished intelligence of your Excellency that I consider\r\n    necessary and of the highest political expediency the maintenance\r\n    of the freedom of the port granted to Jolo; that this franchise\r\n    should be extended to Siasi, which enjoys this privilege in fact\r\n    though not by right; and that care should be taken to prevent the\r\n    slightest obstacle from interfering with the trade at both points,\r\n    to the end that foreign steamers may, in their own interest,\r\n    touch only at these two points of the archipelago of Sulu; that\r\n    the Chinamen should be formed into guilds or associations, after\r\n    the pattern of the organizations prevailing in other parts of the\r\n    Philippines, these being necessary, further, to the making up of\r\n    the lists of tax-payers; that, as a consequence of the formation\r\n    of these associations, they should be compelled to pay taxes to\r\n    the same extent as all other Chinamen residing in the country,\r\n    unless your Excellency is of the opinion that the quota should\r\n    be increased in consideration of the other advantages they enjoy;\r\n    that there should be imposed a tax upon smokers of opium and upon\r\n    the importation thereof. This tax would be a source of revenue of\r\n    some consideration if it were farmed, as was the intention four\r\n    years ago, when sale to the highest bidder was desisted from in\r\n    view of the decree of franchises which is the subject of this\r\n    communication. Finally, that property, commerce, and industries\r\n    should not be taxed, nor should the civilian population be burdened\r\n    with the poll-tax, since the latter deserve consideration by\r\n    reason of the arduous services they render in this place; and\r\n    this applies to the garrison, as well as to the civilians who\r\n    make up the town, who, in the end, would be the persons who\r\n    alone would have to bear these burdens. Such, most excellent\r\n    Sir, is the opinion, expressed as succinctly as possible, of the\r\n    undersigned in regard to these matters, which, at no distant date,\r\n    will present themselves for resolution and which your Excellency\r\n    will determine with your well-known ability and good judgment.\r\n\r\n    Which I have the pleasure to transmit to your most Illustrious\r\n    Excellency, to the end that you may take note of the part relating\r\n    to the economic side of this question.\r\n\r\n\r\n    God preserve your most illustrious Excellency for many years.\r\n\r\n    Manila, July 31st, 1896.\r\n\r\n    Blanco.\r\n\r\n    To the most excellent and most illustrious the Intendant-General\r\n    of the Treasury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOffice of the Intendant-General of the Treasury Division of Direct\r\nImposts\r\n\r\nMost excellent and most illustrious Sir: The just considerations set\r\nforth by the politico-military governor of Sulu in a communication\r\naddressed to his high Excellency the Governor-General of these islands\r\non July 9th of last year, forwarded to your most illustrious Lordship\r\non the 31st of the same month and year, reveal a close study of the\r\nquestions treated, based upon practice and experience.\r\n\r\nThe chief of the division of direct imposts, who signs hereunder,\r\nin presenting the report ordered by your most illustrious Lordship\r\nin your decree of the first day of the following August, must begin\r\nby expressing at once his conformity with the views given by the\r\ngovernor of Sulu, in the part relating to this division.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly considerations of the highest political moment led the\r\nhigh authorities of the Archipelago, on August 23rd of 1887, to extend\r\nfor another term of ten years the franchises granted to Sulu, and\r\nsince these considerations have not ceased to be of moment, to judge\r\nfrom the enlightened views expressed by the said politico-military\r\ngovernor, it is to be presumed that it is expedient to grant a fresh\r\nconcession of franchises; but not, at this time, for a period of time\r\nequal to that about to expire, though for a period that might well be\r\nhalf that of the previous term; for, regarding the matter prudently,\r\nit might happen that during this lapse of time the conditions in\r\nthe places under discussion should alter in such a way as to counsel\r\neither the total suppression of the liberties in question or their\r\npartial modification.\r\n\r\nBut if there are considerations in favor of this new concession,\r\nequity counsels that there be excluded therefrom the Chinese in so far\r\nas relates to the imposition of the poll-tax, since they control all\r\nthe business and are the only persons who really exploit that region.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the chief of the division of direct imposts has the\r\nhonor to report to your most illustrious Lordship:\r\n\r\n1. That it be recommended to his high Excellency the Governor-General\r\nof these Islands, that, to take the place of the present franchises,\r\nthere be granted again, at the proper time, to the ports of Jolo and\r\nSiasi, the exemption from the payment of all urban and industrial taxes\r\nin favor of the natives and of the Chinese established at those points.\r\n\r\n2. That there be created at once the imposition of the poll-tax upon\r\nthe Chinese.\r\n\r\n3. That the natives and the civilian population be exempt from the\r\npayment of poll-tax.\r\n\r\nYour most illustrious Lordship will, however, determine whatever he\r\ndeems most expedient.\r\n\r\n\r\nManila, August 6th, 1897.\r\n\r\nMarcelino Pacheco.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOffice of the Intendant-General of the Treasury Division of Indirect\r\nImposts\r\n\r\nMost excellent and most illustrious Sir: In compliance with the\r\ndecree which, under date of August 10 of the current year, your\r\nmost illustrious Excellency saw fit to issue, to the effect that, in\r\nthe shortest possible space of time the divisions of imposts should\r\nreport upon the matters concerning each one in the proceedings set\r\non foot by the politico-military governor of Sulu in regard to the\r\nexpediency or the inexpediency of the renewal of the exemption from\r\ntaxation enjoyed by the natives in that place, I have to state to\r\nyour illustrious Excellency that:\r\n\r\n1. The undersigned chief, fully agreeing with the enlightened views set\r\nforth by the governor of Sulu, believes that the maintenance of the\r\ndeclaration of freedom of the port granted to Jolo is of the highest\r\npolitical moment and that the franchise should be extended to Siasi.\r\n\r\n2. That in regard to indirect imposts which are of such a nature that,\r\nwhile they are a source of profit to the state, they bring also no\r\nsmall benefit to the tax-payer, these should be made applicable to\r\nthe Sulu archipelago, as undoubtedly has been the case, as a matter\r\nof fact, up to the present time in regard to the stamp and lottery\r\nrevenues.\r\n\r\n3. Both for the reasons set forth by the governor of Sulu as well\r\nas for these given by his predecessor on June 11, 1893, in favor of\r\na tax upon opium smokers, the undersigned chief believes that it is\r\nnot only just but a matter of the greatest necessity to continue the\r\nimposition of this tax.\r\n\r\nYour most illustrious Excellency will, however, order whatever he\r\ndeems most expedient.\r\n\r\n\r\nManila, September 10th, 1897.\r\n\r\nJosé Garcés de Marcilla.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOffice of the Intendant-General of the Treasury,\r\n\r\nManila, December 28, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet the report of the Chamber of Commerce and of the administration\r\nof customs of Manila be heard, within one and the same period of\r\nfive days.\r\n\r\n\r\nDominguez.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XIX\r\n\r\nTHE PROTOCOL OF SULU, OF 1877, BETWEEN SPAIN, GERMANY, AND GREAT\r\nBRITAIN, MAY 30, 1877 [296]\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Government of the Philippines\r\n\r\nRoyal Order\r\n\r\nColonial office.--No. 281.--Excellent Sir: The Secretary of State sent\r\nthe following communication to this office on the 26th of March last:\r\nBy Royal order communicated by the Secretary of State and for such\r\naction as is indicated therein I deliver herewith to your Excellency a\r\ncopy of the protocol signed on the 11th inst. by Señor Manuel Silvela,\r\nSecretary of State, and by the representatives of Great Britain and\r\nGermany, for the purpose of establishing the liberty of trade and\r\ncommerce in the Sulu seas; said protocol takes effect on this date,\r\nas specified in Article 5 of the same.--Referred to your Excellency\r\nby Royal order with a copy of the protocol, for its execution.--God\r\nkeep your Excellency many years.\r\n\r\n\r\nMadrid, April 2, 1877.\r\n\r\nMartin de Herrera. The Governor-General of the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\nManila, May 30, 1877. The above order shall be executed, communicated\r\nand published. Moriones.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Protocol referred to.]\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Austin Henry Layard, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary of her Britannic Majesty; and Count Von Hatzfeldt,\r\nEnvoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of his Majesty the\r\nEmperor of Germany, commissioned by their respective Governments to\r\nterminate the difficulties which have occurred in the Sulu seas and to\r\nestablish for that purpose, in a final way, the liberty of commerce\r\nin those seas, acknowledged by the Secretary of State of Spain in\r\nthe Notes which he sent on April 15, 1876, to the representatives of\r\nGreat Britain and Germany;\r\n\r\nAfter having examined with due attention the preliminaries of the\r\nquestion and especially the negotiations formerly carried on between\r\nthe Governments of Great Britain and Germany and that of Spain,\r\nhave agreed to draw up the following Protocol:\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State of Spain, in the name of his Government, says:\r\n\r\nConsidering the preliminary fact that the German ships \"Marie Louise\"\r\nand \"Gazelle\" were returned and an indemnity paid for their cargoes\r\nin 1873 and 1874, and that the German ship \"Minna\" was returned twice\r\nin 1875 and 1874;\r\n\r\nDuly appreciating the increasing requirements of navigation and\r\ncommerce, and above all the legal status constituted by the Notes of\r\nthe Spanish Secretary of State dated the 15th of April last and by\r\nthe official publication of said Notes by the Governments of Great\r\nBritain and Germany, as also by the instructions given accordingly\r\nby said Governments to their consuls, agents and commanders of their\r\nnaval forces;\r\n\r\nTherefore the Government of his Majesty the King of Spain recognizes\r\nthat the merchant ships going to the Sulu archipelago can no longer\r\nbe required to call first at Zamboanga, to pay the harbor dues there\r\nand to provide themselves with a navigation permit delivered at said\r\nport. It furthermore believes that it must acknowledge, as provided\r\nin the Notes of the 15th of April last, the complete liberty of\r\ndirect trade and commerce for ships and subjects of Great Britain,\r\nthe German Empire and the other powers, with the Sulu archipelago.\r\n\r\nConsidering that the Governments of Great Britain and of Germany have\r\nmaintained all their claims in regard to the liberty of navigation,\r\ncommerce and direct trade with the Sulu archipelago and within the\r\narchipelago; that the Government of his Majesty the King of Spain\r\nadmits that it cannot guarantee the security of commerce at unoccupied\r\nplaces of the archipelago in return for duties and dues paid, but will\r\nguarantee perfect security to the ships and subjects of Great Britain,\r\nGermany and the other powers at places occupied by said Government,\r\nand provide the establishments necessary for the protection of their\r\ntrade, the Spanish Secretary of State remarks that there is no reason\r\nwhy said ships and subjects should be exempted, at places occupied by\r\nSpain, from the formalities, general regulations, and ordinary duties,\r\nwhose nature will be explained in the present Protocol.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned representatives of Great Britain and of Germany refer,\r\non their part, to the Notes and official communications sent by them\r\non this matter to the Spanish Government, and requesting the latter to\r\nacknowledge the absolute liberty of commerce and trade in all parts\r\nof the Sulu archipelago, said acknowledgment having been mentioned\r\nby the Spanish Government in the Notes of April 15, 1876.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of what precedes and as the result of their conferences,\r\nthe undersigned have agreed on the following declarations:\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nCommerce and direct trading by ships and subjects of Great Britain,\r\nGermany and the other powers are declared to be and shall be absolutely\r\nfree with the Sulu archipelago and in all parts thereof, as well as the\r\nright of fishery, without prejudice to the rights recognized to Spain\r\nby the present Protocol, in conformity with the following declarations:\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe Spanish authorities shall no longer require ships and subjects\r\nof Great Britain, Germany and the other powers, going freely to\r\nthe archipelago of Sulu, or from one point to another within the\r\nSulu waters, or from such a point to any other point in the world,\r\nto touch, before or after, at any specified place in the archipelago\r\nor elsewhere, to pay any duties whatsoever, or to get a permit from\r\nsaid authorities, which, on their side, shall refrain from obstructing\r\nor interfering in any way with the above mentioned trade.\r\n\r\nIt is understood that the Spanish authorities shall in no way and under\r\nno pretense prevent the free importation and exportation of all sorts\r\nof goods, without exception, save at such places as are occupied,\r\nand in accordance with Declaration III, and that in all places not\r\noccupied effectively by Spain, neither the ships and subjects above\r\nmentioned nor their goods shall be liable to any tax, duty or payment\r\nwhatsoever, or any sanitary or other regulation.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIn the places occupied by Spain in the archipelago of Sulu the Spanish\r\nGovernment shall be empowered to establish taxes and sanitary and\r\nother regulations, while said places are effectively occupied; but\r\nSpain pledges herself, on her part, to provide in such places the\r\noffices and employees necessary to meet the requirements of commerce\r\nand the application of said regulations. It is however expressly\r\nunderstood that the Spanish Government, while it is resolved to impose\r\nno restrictive regulations in the places occupied by it, pledges itself\r\nvoluntarily not to establish in said places taxes or duties exceeding\r\nthose provided in the Spanish tariffs or in the treaties or conventions\r\nbetween Spain and any other power. Neither shall it put into force\r\nin said places exceptional regulations applicable to the commerce\r\nand subjects of Great Britain, Germany and the other powers. In case\r\nSpain should occupy effectively other places in the archipelago of\r\nSulu, and provide thereat the offices and employees necessary to\r\nmeet the requirements of commerce, the Governments of Great Britain\r\nand Germany shall not object to the application of the rules already\r\nstipulated for places occupied at present. But, in order to avoid the\r\npossibility of new claims due to the uncertainty of business men in\r\nregard to the places which are occupied and subject to regulations and\r\ntariffs, the Spanish Government shall, whenever a place is occupied\r\nin the Sulu archipelago, communicate the fact to the Governments of\r\nGreat Britain and Germany, and inform commerce at large by means of\r\na notification which shall be published in the official journals of\r\nMadrid and Manila. In regard to the tariffs and regulations stipulated\r\nfor places which are occupied at the present time, they shall only be\r\napplicable to the places which may be subsequently occupied by Spain\r\nsix months after the date of publication in the Official Gazette of\r\nMadrid. It remains agreed that no ship or subject of Great Britain,\r\nGermany and other powers shall be required to call at one of the\r\noccupied places, when going to or from a place not occupied by Spain,\r\nand that they shall not be liable to suffer prejudice on that account\r\nor on account of any class of merchandise shipped to an unoccupied\r\nplace in the archipelago.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe three Governments represented by the undersigned pledge themselves\r\nrespectively to publish the present declarations and to have them\r\nstrictly respected by their representatives, consular agents and\r\ncommanders of the naval forces in the seas of the Orient.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nIf the Governments of Great Britain and Germany do not refuse their\r\nadhesion to the present Protocol within 15 days from this date, or if\r\nthey notify their acceptance before the expiration of said period,\r\nthrough their undersigned representatives, the present Declarations\r\nshall then come into force.\r\n\r\n\r\nManuel Silva, Secretary of State of His Majesty the King of Spain.\r\n\r\nDone at Madrid, the 11th of March, 1877.\r\n\r\nA true copy.--Madrid, April 2, 1877.--A true copy.--The Subsecretary,\r\nFrancisco Rubio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XX\r\n\r\nTHE PROTOCOL OF SULU OF 1885, BETWEEN SPAIN, GERMANY, AND GREAT\r\nBRITAIN, MARCH 7, 1885 [297]\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Government of the Philippines\r\n\r\nRoyal Order\r\n\r\nForeign Office.--No. 312.--Excellent Sir: The Secretary of State sends\r\nme the following communication on March 29th, 1885:--Excellent Sir: I\r\nhave the honor to forward you a translated copy of the protocol between\r\nSpain, Germany and Great Britain, the latter two nations recognizing\r\nthe sovereignty of the first over the archipelago of Sulu, signed in\r\nMadrid on the 7th of March, 1885.--I send you this communication by\r\nRoyal order, and enclose a copy of the treaty referred to.

It is understood that the islands of Balabak and Kagayan Sulu\r\nbelong to the archipelago.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Government renounces, as far as regards the British\r\nGovernment, all claims of sovereignty over the territories of the\r\nmainland of Borneo which belong or may have belonged to the Sultan\r\nof Sulu, including the neighboring islands of Balambangan, Banguey,\r\nMalawati, and all those comprised within a zone of three maritime\r\nleagues from the coast, and which are part of the territories\r\nadministered by the company known as \"The British North Borneo\r\nCompany.\"\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Government pledges itself to carry out in the archipelago\r\nof Sulu the stipulations contained in Articles I, II, and III of the\r\nprotocol signed in Madrid on March 11, 1877, viz.: (1) Commerce and\r\ndirect trading by ships and subjects of Great Britain, Germany and the\r\nother powers are declared to be and shall be absolutely free with the\r\narchipelago of Sulu and in all parts thereof, as well as the right\r\nof fishery, without prejudice to the rights recognized to Spain by\r\nthe present Protocol, in conformity with the following declarations:\r\n(2) The Spanish authorities shall no longer require ships and subjects\r\nof Great Britain, Germany and the other powers, going freely to the\r\narchipelago of Sulu, or from one point to another point in the world,\r\nto touch, before or after, at any specified place in the archipelago\r\nor elsewhere, to pay any duties whatsoever, or to get a permit from\r\nsaid authorities, who, on their side, shall refrain from obstructing\r\nor interfering in any way with the above mentioned trade.\r\n\r\nIt is understood that the Spanish authorities shall in no way and\r\nunder no pretense prevent the free importation and exportation of\r\nall sorts of goods, without exception, save at such places as are\r\noccupied, and in accordance with Declaration 3, and that in all places\r\nnot occupied effectively by Spain, neither the ships and subjects\r\nabove mentioned nor their goods shall be subject to any tax, duty\r\nor payment whatsoever, or any sanitary or other regulation. (3) In\r\nthe places occupied by Spain in the archipelago of Sulu, the Spanish\r\nGovernment shall be empowered to establish taxes and sanitary and\r\nother regulations, while said places are effectively occupied; but\r\nSpain pledges herself, on her part, to provide in such places the\r\noffices and employees necessary to meet the requirements of commerce\r\nand the application of said regulations. It is however expressly\r\nunderstood that the Spanish Government, which is resolved to impose\r\nno restrictive regulations in the places occupied by it, pledges\r\nitself voluntarily not to establish in said places taxes or duties\r\nexceeding those provided in the Spanish tariffs or in the treaties\r\nor conventions between Spain and any other power.

The Sultan of Sulu shall direct at once all the Datus and Chiefs\r\nof the Moro rancherias [299] to make up lists of the names of the\r\ninhabitants composing each aggregation, giving therein, besides the\r\nnames, the status of each individual.\r\n\r\n2. These partial lists shall be fused in one single general census\r\nwhich the Sultan of Sulu shall deliver to the politico-military\r\ngovernor of that archipelago before October 1, of the current year.\r\n\r\n3. The interpreters of Jolo, Siasi, Tata'an, and Bangao shall assist\r\nthe Sultan in the work of making up these lists and shall translate\r\nthem into Spanish; and for this extra work they shall receive the\r\nallowances designated below, the amounts being deducted from the\r\ntotal proceeds of the liege-money above referred to.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Allowances\r\n\r\n    To the interpreter of Jolo       P20   per month.\r\n    To the junior linguist of Jolo   P 6   Do.\r\n    To the interpreter of Siasi      P 8   Do.\r\n    To the interpreter of Tata'an    P 8   Do.\r\n    To the interpreter of Bangao     P 8   Do.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.

His high Excellency the Minister of\r\nColonial Affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nExcellent Sir: In compliance with the Royal order communicated\r\nunder date of the 23rd of October last, I have the honor to send\r\nto your Excellency a copy of the previous record of investigations\r\ntransmitted by the office of this General Government, together with\r\nthe report of the office of the secretary, the remittance of which\r\nyour Excellency requests.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry formulated by the politico-military governor of Sulu,\r\narising out of a resolution of the fishery board of the naval station\r\nrelative to the order prohibiting foreign subjects from engaging in\r\nthe pearl fisheries in the waters of the Sulu archipelago, did not call\r\nfor a speedy resolution nor a close study, it being sufficient to bring\r\nthe matter to the knowledge of your Excellency without entering deeply\r\ninto the question involved, in order not to prejudice the resolution of\r\nthe same, leaving to the supreme judgment of his Majesty's Government\r\nthe entire appreciation of its reach and consequences, as the only\r\nauthority acquainted with the demands of our international relations\r\nand the influence thereon of a decision in regard to a matter of such\r\nrecognized importance as is that of the interpretation to be given\r\nto Declaration I of the Sulu Protocol of May 11th of 1877, contained\r\nin Article IV of the Protocol between Spain, Germany, and Great\r\nBritain, signed in Madrid on March 7th, 1885:--hence the brevity of\r\nthe data contained in the communications above referred to and even\r\nthe forbearance of this office from expressing a concrete opinion\r\n(in any case, not called for) in regard to a question as vital as it\r\nis complex. But circumstances, which are always superior to every will\r\nand every calculation, now make prompt action necessary, and not only\r\nforbid any delay, but impose upon this General Government the duty\r\nof emitting an opinion which shall complement the data furnished\r\nby the office of the secretary of the same, which data were less\r\nextensive and explicit than they would certainly have been had not a\r\nrespect for the free initiative of the Supreme Government acted as\r\na restraining influence. The incident arising out of the presence\r\nin the city of Jolo of the British subject Mr. H. W. Dalton, from\r\nSandakan, awaiting the arrival of a fleet of boats of light tonnage\r\nbelonging to the English concern, The Pearling and Trading Co. Ltd.,\r\n[301] of which he is the representative for the purpose of using the\r\nsame in the mother-of-pearl shell fishery, which fact I communicated\r\nto your Excellency by cablegram on the 3rd of the current month,\r\nmakes more urgent the sovereign decision in regard to the concrete\r\npoint as to whether foreign subjects are allowed to engage in the\r\npearl fishery in the archipelago of Sulu.\r\n\r\nIn the judgment of this office (which has, on various occasions,\r\ninspired only by a regard for the best interests of the nation,\r\nexpressed the opinion that the Sulu Protocol is too prejudicial to\r\nthe said interests to permit of the points of doubtful interpretation\r\nin the same being interpreted liberally), the point in regard to the\r\nright of fishery which foreigners lay claim to exercise freely in\r\nwaters under the jurisdiction of our sovereignty, is not a doubtful\r\none at all, but is entirely contrary to their pretensions. The claims\r\nare founded, according to the statements of those who agree with the\r\nviews which they involve, in Declaration I of the said Protocol of\r\n1877, reproduced in the Protocol of 1885 and in that signed in Rome\r\nin the same year, relating to the Caroline and Pelew Archipelagoes.\r\n\r\nThis declaration runs as follows--ratified by Article IV of the second\r\nof these important diplomatic documents:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The direct commerce and trade of boats and subjects of Great\r\n    Britain, of Germany, and of the other powers, is declared, and\r\n    shall be, absolutely free in the archipelago of Sulu and in all\r\n    its parts, as also the right of fishery, without prejudice to the\r\n    rights recognized as belonging to Spain in the present Protocol,\r\n    in conformity with the following declarations * * *.\r\n\r\n    III. At points occupied by Spain in the archipelago of Sulu, the\r\n    Spanish Government may establish imposts, and sanitary and other\r\n    regulations of whatever kind, during the effective occupation of\r\n    the said points * * *.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the transcript it is evident that Spain may regulate the\r\nexercise of the right of traffic and commerce, not with the purpose\r\nof restricting, and much less of denying, the principle of commercial\r\nliberty recognized in Declaration I, but with that of conditioning\r\nthe exercise of that right in such a way that her own rights as\r\na sovereign nation shall not be infringed. And what she may do in\r\nregard to mercantile trade, with greater reason she may and should\r\ndo in everything referring to the right of fishery, a right which is\r\ndeclared only in general terms, and one of which the protocol does\r\nnot treat except in making the affirmation of the principle itself,\r\nwhereas in regard to commerce, it descends to minute details.\r\n\r\nAnd this could not be otherwise, for anything else would be equivalent\r\nto impairing the sovereignty of Spain; and this, in an agreement in\r\nwhich this sovereignty is openly recognized and proclaimed, would\r\npre-suppose a contradiction so palpable and absurd that it is not\r\nworth while even to discuss it.\r\n\r\nSpain, as a sovereign and independent state, holds and exercises her\r\nsovereignty not only in her territories and on the coasts of the same,\r\nbut in her jurisdictional waters, and can, therefore, regulate the\r\nexercise therein of any right granted to foreign subjects, and may,\r\neven, in the exercise of her sovereignty, prohibit the enjoyment\r\nof such right altogether; this is an indisputable principle of\r\ninternational law, though there is nothing to prevent a state from\r\nlimiting the same in favor of another or other states; but it is a\r\nsine qua non condition to this that there shall be an express and clear\r\ndeclaration of her will on this point, and no one can reasonably affirm\r\nthat Spain has made in the Sulu Protocols, neither in that of 1877, nor\r\nin that of 1885, a total or partial surrender of this right in regard\r\nto that of fishery; there is, it is true, a declaration in general\r\nterms that the fisheries are absolutely free in the archipelago of\r\nSulu; but this absoluteness of the principle is immediately qualified\r\nby the condition that it shall be without prejudice to the rights\r\nrecognized as belonging to Spain in the protocol, and it has already\r\nbeen pointed out that one of these rights--the principal one and\r\nthat which contains all the others, the right of sovereignty--is\r\nproclaimed and recognized at the head of the agreement. Outside this\r\ndeclaration in general terms, there will not be found in all the\r\nprotocol a provision or regulation referring to the exercise of the\r\nright of fishery and much less a concrete and express declaration on\r\nthe part of Spain that she will permit the exercise thereof freely on\r\nher coasts and in her territorial waters. To permit of this a concrete,\r\nclear, and definite declaration would be necessary, such as is to be\r\nfound in the Morocco Treaty, signed on November 30, 1861, Article 57\r\nof which establishes qualifiedly \"That Spanish subjects shall have a\r\nright to fish along the coasts of the Moroccan Empire;\" and even so,\r\nin Article 60 of the same treaty, it is stipulated that, in order to\r\nfacilitate the coral fishery, in which the Spaniards engage on the\r\ncoast of Morocco, fishers shall pay the sum of 150 Spanish dollars for\r\neach coral fishing boat, and that through the representative of Spain\r\nthey shall request permission from the minister of foreign affairs\r\nof His Majesty the Sultan who shall issue the necessary authorization.\r\n\r\nFrom which it may be seen that even in the case of declarations in\r\nregard to the right of fishery which are concrete, clear and definite,\r\nthere is needed, for the free exercise of the same, something more\r\nthan a declaration in general terms, such as is that contained in\r\nthe Sulu Protocol of 1877.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is always customary in international agreements which\r\nrefer to fishery rights to lay down regulations and provisions which\r\nshall regulate the exercise of such rights, as is proved by a multitude\r\nof agreements, among which are: that already cited of Morocco, that of\r\nFebruary 18th, 1886, between Spain and France regarding the fishery\r\nand navigation of the Bidasoa, in which the right of oyster fishing\r\nis restricted, its absolute prohibition being made possible; as also\r\nthat of 1889 ratifying the preceding one, the Portuguese convention\r\nof March 27th of 1893 and the coast police and fishery regulations;\r\nas well as that of August 22nd of 1894, in regard to the fisheries\r\nin the waters of the Algarbes, etc.; all of which is well known by\r\nthe illustrious Government of His Majesty, and attention is called\r\nto it here only in support of the opinion maintained, namely, that\r\nthe right to authorize, condition, restrict, and even prohibit the\r\nengagement in fishery on its coast and in its jurisdictional waters\r\nis inherent in the sovereignty of an independent state; and if it has\r\nthis right in regard to fisheries in general, with greater reason must\r\nit preserve and exercise the same in regard to oyster fisheries, by\r\nreason of the changes which may be produced in the sea bed, and even\r\nfor the purpose of preserving the breeding grounds of the precious\r\npearl-shell mollusk, the Avicula Margaritifera, the banks being the\r\nproperty of the nation, and like all its territory, inalienable and\r\nnon-prescriptible; both so that they shall not be exhausted and that\r\ntheir exploitation may be reserved for the national industry.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding, written with less detail than would have been the\r\ncase had the pressure of time permitted, it may easily be inferred\r\nthat, in the opinion of this General Government, Spain in spite of\r\nDeclaration I of the Sulu Protocol--perhaps it would be more correct\r\nto say, by virtue of that very declaration, the terms of which\r\nreally determine the meaning of Declaration III and Article I of the\r\nTreaty--preserves intact her right as a sovereign nation to restrict,\r\ncondition, and even prohibit engagement in the oyster fishery on her\r\ncoasts and in her jurisdictional waters, without further limitations\r\nthan those which she may deem expedient to self-impose.\r\n\r\nAdmitting her rights as a sovereign state, there arises a question of\r\na political nature, which the circumstances above indicated convert\r\ninto a problem demanding an early resolution.\r\n\r\nTo what extent should Spain exercise this right?\r\n\r\nOn this point, the views of the General Government will be expressed\r\nas concisely as possible and with the soberness demanded both by the\r\nrespect due to the high prerogatives of the public authorities and by\r\nan ignorance of many of the elements which enter into the question,\r\nwithout a knowledge of which it is difficult to determine to what\r\nextent it is expedient to restrict the exercise of the right to engage\r\nin the oyster fisheries which foreign subjects claim to exercise freely\r\nin the Sulu archipelago, a pretension which this General Government\r\nregards as entirely opposed to the rights of Spain and her moral and\r\nmaterial interests in the Far East. Our prestige with the Malay races\r\nhere, our moral influence over these semi-civilized Mohammedan people,\r\nwho recognize no right or supremacy but that of might, demand that\r\nSpain, as a colonizing nation, shall maintain the integrity of her\r\nsovereignty and shall not seem to be subjugated to the will of other\r\nPowers, as would appear if, in her territories and on her coasts,\r\nwith the knowledge and permission of her authorities and of her war\r\nships, and without even heeding them, foreigners should perform acts\r\nwhich, like that of engaging in the mother-of-pearl fishery, being\r\ncontrary to our material interests, cannot be carried out without\r\npaying tribute to the Moro sultans and chieftains themselves.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the need for preserving cordial relations with\r\nGermany and England and for maintaining the most perfect understanding\r\nbetween the European powers in anticipation of some concerted action\r\nin regard to the Empires of China and of Japan, which will render\r\nnecessary in the future the expansive policy of the latter towards\r\nthe south, as well as the hegemony claimed by the latter in the\r\nOrient, counsel a circumspect international policy and a moderate\r\nexercise of our sovereign rights in the archipelago of Sulu; and for\r\nthis reason, perhaps it would be inexpedient to forbid the right of\r\nfishery to foreign subjects, as such action would certainly give rise\r\nto diplomatic questions and remonstrances, which should be avoided\r\nat any cost; but this General Government deems it indispensable to\r\ncondition and regulate the exercise of this fishery right, especially\r\nin so far as it relates to the pearl-producing oyster, the exploitation\r\nof which should be governed by considerations of our prestige and\r\nof the advantage and benefit of our material interests. Supported\r\ntherefore by our right of sovereignty, by international practice,\r\nand by the terms of Declarations I and III of the Protocol of 1877 and\r\nof Articles I and IV of that of 1885, there should be issued certain\r\ncoast police and fishery regulations for the Sulu archipelago, laying\r\ndown clearly the relations which are to exist between the Spanish\r\nGovernment and foreign subjects engaging in the fishery industries\r\nalong our coasts and in our jurisdictional waters; which industries\r\nshould not be engaged in, especially in the case of the oyster,\r\nwithout the necessary authorization of the Spanish authorities, and\r\nafter the payment of the corresponding industrial patent or license,\r\nor of the dues which it may be deemed expedient to exact.\r\n\r\nMuch more might be said in regard to this important question,\r\nas unexpectedly presented as it is urgent of resolution, given\r\nthe conditions created by the claim of the British subject\r\nMr. H. W. Dalton; and this General Government appreciates fully\r\nthe deficiency of its suggestions, which will be advantageously\r\nsupplemented by the great wisdom of his Majesty's Government, its\r\nexalted patriotism, and the solicitous care that it gives to everything\r\ntouching the high interests of the nation, by which elevated sentiments\r\nthey are inspired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XXIII\r\n\r\nROYAL DIRECTIONS RELATIVE TO THE TREATMENT OF FOREIGNERS ENGAGED IN\r\nPEARL FISHING IN THE SULU WATERS, MARCH 23, 1896 [302]\r\n\r\n\r\nColonial Office\r\n\r\nExcellent Sir: Examined by this office of the government the papers\r\ntransmitted by your Excellency with the official communication\r\nNo. 1967, of September 16th last, in the question raised by the\r\npolitico-military governor of Sulu, by reason of a communication\r\naddressed to the same by the office of the commander-general of\r\nthe naval station at Manila, directing the prohibition of the\r\nmother-of-pearl fishery in the waters of Sulu and the Carolines;\r\nstudied also the report of the General Government, and that of the\r\ncouncil of administration of the Philippines, and heard also the\r\nillustrious opinion of the Department of State, to secure which the\r\npapers were sent there, accompanied by the Royal order of the 7th of\r\nJanuary last; bearing in mind that our prestige among the natives in\r\nthose islands would perforce suffer seriously if foreigners were to\r\nperform, without any intervention on the part of our authorities, acts,\r\nwhich, like that of engaging in the mother-of-pearl shell fishery,\r\nthey cannot carry on without paying tribute to the Moro Sultans and\r\nchieftains; though it is not less true that the absolute prohibition of\r\nthe right of fishery to foreigners would arouse, as wisely foreseen by\r\nyour Excellency, diplomatic remonstrances based upon the Protocol of\r\nSulu of March 7th, 1886; his Majesty the King (whom God protect), the\r\nQueen Regent of the Kingdom acting in his name, has seen fit to direct\r\nthat your Excellency be informed that he has seen with pleasure the\r\ntact and prudence with which this question has been dealt with, in the\r\nfirst place by your Excellency, and afterwards by all the authorities\r\nwho have intervened in the same; that so long as the representative of\r\nthe English Pearling and Trading Company, the captains of their boats,\r\nor other foreigners, do not urge with importunity the right to carry\r\non the industry of the mother-of-pearl shell fishery within the zone of\r\njurisdictional waters and at occupied places, an endeavor must be made\r\nto prevent their doing so, in order, if possible, to set a precedent\r\nfavorable to our interests; and that in the event of their insisting,\r\nit will be necessary to permit them to engage in the industry of the\r\nmother-of-pearl fishery, with the obligation to submit in so doing to\r\nthe rules and regulations now in force or which may be put into force\r\nhereafter. It is also the wish of his Majesty that your Excellency be\r\napprised of the expediency of formulating, with the greatest possible\r\ndespatch, coast police and fishery regulations for the archipelagoes\r\nof Sulu and the Carolines; in which regulations care must be taken not\r\nto make special mention of the Protocols, nor to recognize expressly\r\nthe rights of foreigners, and, on the other hand, not to depart from\r\nthe terms of the provisions of these international agreements, so\r\nthat in the event of any foreigners claiming the right in question,\r\nthey shall not be able to elude compliance with the regulations by\r\nbasing their pretensions on the terms of the said Protocols; for all\r\nof which your Excellency will place yourself in harmony with the\r\ncompetent authorities whose duty it is to take cognizance of this\r\nmatter, submitting afterwards for the approbation of this office\r\ndrafts of the coast police and fishery regulations above referred to.\r\n\r\nBy Royal order I communicate the above to you for proper action.\r\n\r\nGod protect your Excellency many years.\r\n\r\n\r\nMadrid, March 23rd, 1896.\r\n\r\nTomas Castellano: rubricated.\r\n\r\nTo the Honorable the Governor-General of the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XXIV\r\n\r\nLA TORRE'S VIEWS ON THE POLICY THAT SHOULD BE ADOPTED IN MINDANAO\r\nAND SULU, JANUARY 11, 1893 [303]\r\n\r\n\r\nOffice of the Governor-General of the Philippines\r\n\r\nA seal with the inscription: \"Office of the Captain-General of the\r\nPhilippines. Headquarters.\"\r\n\r\nExcellent Sir: At all times the condition of the unsubdued regions\r\nof the island of Mindanao and, in general, of the whole archipelago,\r\nhas occupied the close attention of the Governors-General of these\r\nIslands, and they have studied, according to their respective views,\r\nthe best methods for the complete subjection of the same.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I have meditated deeply upon every thing relating\r\nto this important matter, and judging both from past experience\r\nand from observations that I have been able to make personally,\r\nas I apprised your Excellency after my return from a visit to the\r\naforementioned island on May 29th last, I believe it is evident\r\nthat the adoption of the same system for the subjection of different\r\nraces will not be productive of good results. In the island of Luzon,\r\na properly understood policy of conciliation, accompanied by slight\r\ndisplays of force, will be successful in conciliating and subduing\r\nthe people sooner or later; for it may be observed at once that here\r\nthere does not exist that great racial antagonism which nearly always\r\nmakes compromise impossible. Such a policy, linked with prudence and\r\nparticularly with justice on the part of the delegates of authority,\r\nwill always be productive of great results, aside from the fact that\r\nthere are here many villages whose inhabitants are not warlike, but,\r\non the contrary, are docile, and await only some slight indication on\r\nour part to regard us as protectors and allies against their enemies.\r\n\r\nMuch has already been done in this direction, as is shown by the many\r\npolitico-military provinces existing in this island; but we should\r\nnot stop in this island of progress; and in order to carry forward\r\nand consummate the complete subjugation of the extensive districts not\r\nyet subdued, troops must be detailed,--not in very large numbers, but\r\nstill in numbers sufficiently large to affect appreciably the service,\r\nequally necessary in other regions of the archipelago. This is one\r\nof the reasons which make requisite an increase in the army force\r\nstationed here; further, if the number of the comandancias [304]\r\nis to be increased, it is obvious that, in order to garrison them,\r\nmore troops are needed.\r\n\r\nI have pointed out the need there is for employing different methods\r\nfor the subjection of the different races; and in fact, in regard\r\nto the races inhabiting Mindanao, I believe that it is obvious and\r\nunquestionable that favorable results will never be secured without\r\nemploying methods other than those of attraction.\r\n\r\nThe Moro race is completely antithetic to the Spanish, whether the\r\nlatter be peninsular or indigenous, and will ever be our eternal enemy.\r\n\r\nThe past proves clearly that those ostensible and ephemeral\r\nsubmissions, apparently guaranteed by oaths and agreements, do not\r\nbind the Moros in the slightest degree; for, knowing nothing of the\r\nfirst principles of good-faith and loyalty, they do not hesitate\r\nto break their promises whenever a favorable opportunity offers and\r\nthey think it possible to defeat our troops. They make a pretense of\r\nbeing trusting and attentive even to our smallest suggestions, but\r\nthey are always watching for a good chance to open up hostilities,\r\nand will resort to treason and cunning.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons it is well that they should know that we are the\r\nstronger; that our friendship suits their interests because we are\r\nbacked by force--which is the only argument they can understand;\r\nthat their friendship is of no moment to us; and that the instant\r\nthey antagonize us, they will be promptly and severely punished.\r\n\r\nHaving taken up this point of view, the policy that we should adopt\r\nmay be inferred.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to undertake operations on a large scale, or to\r\nopen what might be termed a regular campaign, as has been done every\r\ntwo or three years in the past; but, with our troops established at\r\na number of fortified places, it may be seen at once from what has\r\nbeen said above, that we ought to maintain them there at any cost,\r\nand that, abandoning an attitude entirely passive, we should advance\r\nlittle by little in our conquest, always establishing ourselves\r\nfirmly on the territory conquered. In this way we shall, step by\r\nstep, bring under our dominion a large area of territory, at the same\r\ntime extending our sphere of influence towards the interior. Given\r\nthe conditions above described, it will be understood at once how\r\nmuch we should lose in importance in the eyes of such an enemy if,\r\nin response to their frequent attacks, we confined ourselves entirely\r\nto a defensive policy, for they would interpret such an attitude as\r\nan indication of weakness; consequently it is impossible for us to\r\nmaintain an attitude of inactivity: rather, taking advantage of the\r\ntreacherous conduct of the enemy, we should castigate them by means\r\nof rapid and unexpected excursions lasting a few days, and for this\r\npurpose it is indispensable that small columns of troops be stationed\r\nat two or three well chosen points.\r\n\r\nThat the Moros are not disposed to be our friends is evident: and\r\nwhile frequent examples in the history of these islands, in addition\r\nto what has been said above, are sufficient to prove this assertion,\r\nit is further corroborated by the many despatches I have addressed to\r\nyour Excellency, apprising you of the attacks made by the Moros upon\r\nour troops and especially of the incidents which have taken place\r\nduring the last months of the year 1892. These I will recapitulate\r\nsuccinctly, as they show that, far from breaking the rebels, the\r\nevents have only increased their strength.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of October 28th, while a reconnaissance was being made\r\nat the post of Baras, the detachment making the same was attacked\r\nby some fifty or sixty Moros, who were awaiting them in ambush. The\r\nlatter were, however, repulsed, and our troops being reënforced by a\r\ndetachment from the fort, the enemy fled, leaving five dead on the\r\nfield, besides two spears, three krises, three kampilan, and two\r\ndaggers, the losses on our side being one dead and five wounded.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of November 9th, again at the time of making a\r\nreconnaissance, at the post of Malabang, our men were attacked by\r\nsome sixty Moros, who, being repulsed, fled, leaving six dead on the\r\nfield--three others dying later, according to reports received--besides\r\nfour kampilan, three krises, one tabas, one lance, and four daggers;\r\nthe losses of our side being one soldier killed and six wounded.\r\n\r\nThese two posts being afterwards visited by the military commander\r\nof Illana Bay and the politico-military governor of Mindanao, by\r\nreason of reports having been received that some thousand Moros had\r\nbanded together for the purpose of attacking these two places, they\r\ninformed me that excellent discipline prevailed among the troops of\r\nthe said garrisons, and that the Moros must have beaten a retreat,\r\nsince they had not been seen in that country.\r\n\r\nOn my part I have directed that the greatest possible vigilance,\r\ncare, and watchfulness be exercised at all the posts, never losing\r\nsight of the fact that they are always in the presence of the enemy,\r\nas is proved by the frequency with which they have been attacked. I\r\nhave ordered, further, that, when making reconnaissances or upon any\r\nother occasion when it is necessary to separate a detachment from the\r\nmain body, the greatest number of soldiers that the circumstances\r\npermit be employed, so as to prevent a surprise or ambuscade,\r\nwhich aside from the direct loss that it entails, might have the\r\neffect of demoralizing the troops, and so of increasing the boldness\r\nand temerity of the enemy; I have given special instructions, too,\r\nthat the officers display in the field the greatest possible energy,\r\nso as to keep up the spirits and confidence of the men.\r\n\r\nIn the northern portion of Mindanao, between Iligan and Mumungan the\r\nMoros have also been active in making attacks, and although beaten\r\nin every case, thanks to the good discipline prevailing among the\r\nmen and the judgment shown by the officers, who inspire the former\r\nwith confidence and afford them a good example at all times, they\r\nstill hope to have better luck in their future raids, as is proved\r\nby the despatches received from the politico-military commander of\r\nMumungan. These despatches show that our soldiers no longer fear the\r\nMoro race, nor even the Juramentados; and that our men always await the\r\nattack of the enemy with great calmness and bravery, as is shown by\r\nthe accounts of the frequent ambuscades laid and surprises attempted\r\nby the Moros. Already at the beginning of 1892 the attitude of the\r\nsultans and datus in the neighborhood of Mumungan was so questionable\r\nthat Captain Abad, then commander of the fort there, having attempted\r\nto go up the river Agus, accompanied by only one officer and four\r\nmen--thus in the guise of absolute peace--Datu Ala, of Balud, who\r\nis now our friend, stopped him when he approached his territory,\r\ntelling him that although he wished to live at peace with us, he\r\ncould not allow him to advance further, nor any part of our troops\r\nto do so. In spite of this, two months after this incident, General\r\nCastilla, following closely my instructions, and taking advantage of\r\nthe circumstance foreseen by me--that upon his arrival at Mumungan he\r\nwas visited by the neighboring datus and sultans, including the Sultan\r\nof Pantar, he announced to the latter, acting under instructions from\r\nme, his intention of returning the friendly visit. Leaving Mumungan\r\nearly, in spite of a continuous heavy rain storm, he reached Pantar\r\nat about eleven in the morning without making any stop, accompanied\r\nby Ala and another datu, and while he was holding an affectionate\r\ninterview with the Sultan of Pantar and the troops were resting,\r\nthe captain of engineers, Navarro, made a clandestine inspection of\r\nthe ground and took a rough sketch of the best site for the future\r\nfort, close to a bridge that can be built across the river Agus,\r\nwith a turret or rough defensive fortification on the opposite bank;\r\nthis done, General Castilla returned that same afternoon to Mumungan,\r\nwhich he reached before night, without having fired a shot, in spite of\r\nthe predictions of the datus that he might easily meet with resistance\r\non the road.\r\n\r\nLater, all the datus living in the region lying between Pantar and\r\nIligan reiterated to me, personally, in May last, at Mumungan, and\r\nlater to the military commander, their protestations of adhesion to\r\nSpain. Afterwards there came the visit that a goodly number of datus,\r\namong them the Datu of Pantar, made me in Manila, where they remained\r\nand were entertained during fifteen days; and with the consistent\r\napproval of these, the road from Iligan to Mumungan was built, in\r\nconsequence of which work the weekly attendance of Moros at the market\r\nof Iligan increased, and the Datu of Bukamar and another from Marawi\r\npresented themselves in that place. Thither also the Datu Amay-Pakpak,\r\nnow an old man, promised to send his son. The concurrence of Moros\r\nat that place was further increased by the assistance that was given\r\nto a wounded Moro; until, at last, a solemn oath of allegiance was\r\nsecured, being taken, in the presence of the aforementioned military\r\ncommander, by a great number of datus and sultans, in accordance with\r\ntheir ritual.\r\n\r\nOn November 8th, the military commander of Mumungan, under the pretext\r\nof a wedding to which the Datu of Pantar had invited him and which he\r\nattended, made an inspection of the country in the neighborhood of\r\nthe said rancheria [305] of Pantar, lying to the south of Mumungan,\r\nand had an opportunity of seeing that, in conformity with the reports\r\nI had received, Pantar possessed advantageous conditions for the\r\nestablishment there of another advance fort, the construction of\r\nwhich could be commenced upon the continuation and completion up\r\nto that point of the new road built from Iligan to Mumungan. But in\r\nspite of the good intentions of the military commander not to break\r\ninto hostilities except in the last resort, in accordance with the\r\npositive instructions I had given him, he was unable to prevent his\r\ntroops being attacked upon the return journey, and therefore they\r\nopened fire upon the enemy; which proves once again the difficulty of\r\nfollowing the path of conciliation and attraction with an enemy who\r\npays absolutely no heed to reason; in spite of the fact that with\r\nthis method there had been joined that of warning the neighboring\r\nMoros who profess to be so friendly, that the only genuine proof of\r\nadhesion to which I should give credit would be that of the moral\r\nand collective support of all of them against any act of aggression\r\nwithin their territory committed by Moros from other rancherias,\r\nwhether in large or in small numbers.\r\n\r\nOn November 25th I was informed by the same military commander that,\r\nwhile the convoy was transferring supplies from Mumungan to Iligan,\r\nthere appeared a juramentado, who attempted to wound a soldier; but\r\nthe latter, waiting for him with great calmness, defended himself\r\nvaliantly, and the Moro was despatched with the assistance of some\r\nother soldiers who came upon the scene.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of December I was informed that a detachment of the troops\r\nstationed at Mumungan, while on its way to the market of Iligan was\r\nattacked by a body of fourteen juramentados who, however, were repulsed\r\nwith a loss of two killed, while, on our side, one man was lost.\r\n\r\nAt Baras, also, while making the reconnaissance on December 10th there\r\nappeared a band of Moros in an attitude of hostility; but they were\r\ncompelled to retire at the first volley from our troops. Nevertheless,\r\ntwo juramentados separated themselves from the main body and attacked\r\nan equal number of our men; the latter awaited them firmly and killed\r\nthem with bayonet thrusts. Another Moro was also slain while attempting\r\na precipitate flight. Recently, on the 15th of December, the military\r\ncommander of Mumungan, hearing of the intentions of the enemy, which\r\nwere far from peaceable, determined, in order to guard against all\r\ncontingencies, to continue the extension of the road and to complete\r\nand close the palisade around the new inclosure at the fort, made so\r\nas to accommodate the increased number of troops. For the first of\r\nthese two purposes, he left the fort at half past five in the morning,\r\nwell-armed and ready to punish the Moros if they presented themselves,\r\nsetting out with one hundred and fifty men of the 73rd regiment and\r\nsixteen convicts, besides a corporal and eight persons of the 73rd\r\nin charge of a company of engineers, another company of the 73rd and\r\nsixty convicts, who marched without arms and equipped for work.\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock in the morning the advance guard reached the entrance to\r\nthe wood, and as the intention was to collect lumber that had already\r\nbeen cut and dragged to the road, the troops advanced. At this moment\r\nthere appeared in the middle of the road some eight hundred Moros\r\nbrandishing their arms and uttering war-cries, who immediately retired\r\nto some defensive works which they had constructed out of the very\r\nlogs above referred to. In view of this, our troops continued their\r\nmarch, opening fire at about one hundred yards from the defensive\r\nworks of the enemy, and in a little while, captured the same, routing\r\nthe defenders, as well as some more of the enemy who appeared on the\r\ntwo flanks of the column, causing some eighty deaths; on our side we\r\nhad one killed and two wounded convicts. After this incident, the said\r\nmilitary commander made his way to Iligan without suffering any attack,\r\nin spite of the fact that the Moros had constructed other defensive\r\nworks on the road, which latter were destroyed without any casualties.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the troops on this march was brilliant, and I wish to\r\nrecommend to the consideration of your Excellency those who especially\r\ndistinguished themselves; but I have again directed the military\r\ncommander of Mumungan to avoid as far as possible all necessity for\r\nfresh combats, extending, but without any compromise of dignity,\r\nthe policy of conciliation which I have so strongly recommended to him.\r\n\r\nFrom all the above your Excellency will understand with how much\r\nforesight I requested from the Government of his Majesty, on the\r\n24th of April last, permission to place on a war footing as many of\r\nthe seven regiments which make up the infantry in these Islands as\r\nhad not yet been placed on this footing, setting forth the estimated\r\ncost of the same in the plans which I sent for approval, and if the\r\nincrease was necessary then, it is evident that at the present time\r\nit is much more necessary; for, as your Excellency will see from what\r\nI have communicated to you in this extensive document, the condition\r\nof the Moros, justifying the predictions made by me at that time,\r\nhas become steadily more hostile as they never rest nor miss any\r\nopportunity of causing us the greatest possible harm, endeavoring\r\nto obstruct all the work we plan to carry out for the improvement\r\nof the means of communication between our present possessions; and\r\nwhile it is true that they are not successful in their attempts,\r\nstill we must put a stop to their increasing audacity.\r\n\r\nI take the liberty again to call the attention of your Excellency to\r\nthe absolute necessity of placing on a war footing the three regiments\r\nnow on a footing of peace, in accordance with the permission already\r\ngranted by the Department--without waiting until next July. In this\r\nway, without undertaking a regular campaign, as I have already stated,\r\nand without expense to the Government, it will be possible to improve\r\nthe present condition of things, which is gradually becoming somewhat\r\ndiscreditable to the honor of the flag. I do not doubt that your\r\nExcellency will so understand it, and I thank you in advance, in\r\nthe name of this suffering army, for the immediate concession of the\r\ncredit necessary for the reënforcement above mentioned. God protect\r\nyour Excellency many years.\r\n\r\n\r\nManila, January 11th, 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost Excellent Sir:--Eulogio Despojol.--Followed by a rubric.

The\r\nidea is that the settler acknowledges that he does not own the land\r\nin fee simple, but holds it as a tenant of the state.\r\n\r\n[217] A police force maintained in the Philippines during Spanish\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n[218] Troops made up of men deported from other parts of the Islands.\r\n\r\n[219] A large knife used by Moros in fighting.\r\n\r\n[220] Men who have taken an oath to kill non-Mohammedans.\r\n\r\n[221] Moro cannon.\r\n\r\n[222] About 5 cents, United States currency.\r\n\r\n[223] See Appendix XVIII, on regulations relative to taxes and\r\nimports on natives and immigrants in Sulu; also Appendix XIX, on the\r\nprotocol of Sulu of 1877 between Spain, Germany, and Great Britain;\r\nAppendix XX, on the protocol of Sulu of 1885 between Spain, Germany,\r\nand Great Britain; Appendix XXI, decree of the General Government\r\nin regard to payment of tribute of Sulus; Appendixes XXII and XXIII,\r\non rights of foreigners engaged in pearl fishing in Sulu waters.\r\n\r\n[224] A chief subordinate to a datu.\r\n\r\n[225] See Appendix XXIV, on La Torre's views on the policy that should\r\nbe adopted in Mindanao and Sulu.\r\n\r\n[226] The Philippine Islands, Blair and Robertson, XV, pp. 93-100.\r\n\r\n[227] A point and settlement on the north bank of the Mindanao River\r\nand at its mouth.\r\n\r\n[228] A careful review of Ronquillo's reports and letters on his\r\npacification of Mindanao shows an evident error in the use of the\r\nword Bwayan to signify the settlement or stronghold of the Sultan\r\nof Magindanao. Bwayan here, and probably in Figueroa's report, too,\r\nis used in place of Magindanao, which lay on the site occupied at\r\npresent by Kotabato. Bwisan was then the Sultan of Magindanao and\r\nheaded the opposition to Ronquillo's advance up the north branch of\r\nthe Mindanao River. Sirungan, who is mentioned in this report, might\r\nhave been a datu or subdatu of Magindanao, not necessarily Sirungan,\r\nthe Raja of Bwayan.\r\n\r\n[229] The correct name is Sirungan.\r\n\r\n[230] Cachil or Kachil is a Malay word signifying \"little\" or \"young,\"\r\nhence a youth of distinction or a younger prince of the royal line.\r\n\r\n[231] A tributary of the Mindanao River which rises in Talayan,\r\nand empties at Taviran.\r\n\r\n[232] The Philippine Islands, Blair and Robertson, XI, pp. 135-139.\r\n\r\n[233] Unsigned.\r\n\r\n[234] Point or bay, not an Island.\r\n\r\n[235] Point or bay, not an island.\r\n\r\n[236] The Strait of Sunda, which separates Java from Sumatra.\r\n\r\n[237] The Philippine Islands, Blair and Robertson, XV, pp. 190-196.\r\n\r\n[238] This word is as commonly used with an \"l\" as with an \"r,\"\r\nas Sirungan.\r\n\r\n[239] A strong wind south by west.\r\n\r\n[240] Shields.\r\n\r\n[241] This was the first piratical expedition made against the\r\nSpaniards by the inhabitants of the southern islands. (Rizal.)\r\n\r\nBarrantes (Guerras Piraticas) wrongly dates the abandonment of La\r\nCaldera and the incursion of the Moros 1590. Continuing, he says:\r\n\"The following year they repeated the expedition so that the Indians\r\nretired to the densest parts of the forests, where it cost considerable\r\ntrouble to induce them to become quiet, for a woman, who proclaimed\r\nherself a sibyl or prophetess, preached to them that they should not\r\nobey the Spaniards any longer, for the latter had allied themselves\r\nwith the Moros to exterminate all the Pintados.\"\r\n\r\n[242] Native word for mountain.\r\n\r\n[243] Those to whom land had been granted with control over the\r\nnatives who worked on it.\r\n\r\n[244] The Island of Gimarás, southeast of Panay, and separated from\r\nit by the Strait of Iloilo.\r\n\r\n[245] Probably gongs.\r\n\r\n[246] Neither Stanley nor Rizal throws any light on this word. The\r\nSpanish dictionaries likewise fail to explain it, as does also a\r\nlimited examination of Malay and Tagal dictionaries. Three conjectures\r\nare open: 1. A derivative of tifatas, a species of mollusk, hence a\r\nconch; 2. A Malay or Tagal word for either a wind or other instrument,\r\nthe Malay words for \"to blow,\" \"sound a musical instrument,\" being\r\ntiyup and tiyupkan; 3. A misprint for the Spanish pifas, a possible\r\nshortened form of pifanos, signifying fifes.\r\n\r\n[247] The Philippine Islands, Blair and Robertson, XV, pp. 240-244,\r\n264-268.\r\n\r\n[248] Sailing vessels.\r\n\r\n[249] The Philippine Islands, Blair and Robertson, XXIII, pp. 87, 88.\r\n\r\n[250] Unsigned.\r\n\r\n[251] A small vessel used as a tender to carry messages between\r\nlarger vessels.\r\n\r\n[252] The Philippine Islands, Blair and Robertson, XXVIII, pp. 41-63.\r\n\r\n[253] In the manuscript that we follow the letter of March 31 is\r\ngiven second, while that of April 5 is given first; we have arranged\r\nthem chronologically.\r\n\r\n[254] Garo: probably the same as garita; a fortified outpost.\r\n\r\n[255] The translation of this passage seems to be, \"If God fights\r\nagainst a city, he who guards it watches in vain.\" The difficulty\r\nlies in \"a custodierit,\" which we translate as \"fights against.\"\r\n\r\n[256] A Spanish measure of length which is about equal to 1 yard,\r\nEnglish measure.\r\n\r\n[257] The Gimbahans or Sulus of the interior mountains.\r\n\r\n[258] Babui, in their language, signifies \"pig\"; apparently they\r\ncalled the Spaniards \"swine,\" as expressing the acme of contempt for\r\ntheir besiegers.\r\n\r\n[259] \"Thanks be to God who has given us the victory through our Lord\r\nJesus Christ.\"\r\n\r\n[260] Combés says (Hist. Mindanao, Reana's ed., column 264) that this\r\nqueen, named Tuan Baluka, was a native of Basilan, and that she had\r\nacquired such ascendancy over her husband that the government of Sulu\r\nwas entirely in her hands. This statement explains the presence of\r\nthe Basilan men in the Sulu stronghold.\r\n\r\n[261] Zamboanga, the correct spelling is Samboangan.\r\n\r\n[262] Culverins of small bore.\r\n\r\n[263] This letter is unsigned; but the transcript of it made by\r\nVentura del Arco places it with others ascribed to Barrios.
