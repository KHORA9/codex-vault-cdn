PUTNAM'S SONS, NEW YORK AND LONDON\r\n\r\nRESPECTFULLY DEDICATED\r\nTO\r\nPROFESSOR GEORG VON WYSS\r\nAND\r\nPROFESSOR G. MEYER VON KNONAU\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many reasons, some of which are obvious to the least thoughtful, the\r\nhistory of Switzerland is peculiarly interesting, and not least so to\r\nEnglish-speaking peoples. In the first place, the \"playground of Europe\"\r\nis every year visited by large numbers of British and Americans, some of\r\nwhom indeed are familiar with almost every corner of it. Then to the\r\nAnglo-Saxon race the grand spectacle of a handful of freemen nobly\r\nstruggling for and maintaining their freedom, often amidst enormous\r\ndifficulties, and against appalling odds, cannot but be heart-stirring.\r\nTo the citizen of the great American republic a study of the\r\nconstitution of the little European republic should bring both interest\r\nand profit--a constitution resembling in many points that of his own\r\ncountry, and yet in many other respects so different. And few readers,\r\nof whatever nationality, can, we think, peruse this story without a\r\nfeeling of admiration for a gallant people who have fought against\r\noppression as the Swiss have fought, who have loved freedom as they\r\nhave loved it, and who have performed the well-nigh incredible feats of\r\narms the Switzers have performed. And as Sir Francis O. Adams and Mr.\r\nCunningham well point out in their recently published work on the Swiss\r\nConfederation, as a study in constitutional history, the value of the\r\nstory of the development of the Confederation can hardly be\r\nover-estimated.\r\n\r\nFew of the existing accounts of Swiss history which have appeared in the\r\nEnglish language go back beyond the year 1291 A.D., the date of the\r\nearliest Swiss League, and of course Switzerland as a nation cannot\r\nboast of an earlier origin. But surely some account should be given of\r\nthe previous history of the men who founded the League. For a country\r\nwhich has been occupied at different periods by lakemen, Helvetians, and\r\nRomans; where Alamanni, Burgundians, and Franks have played their parts;\r\nwhere Charlemagne lived and ruled, and Charles the Bold fought; where\r\nthe great families of the Zaerings, the Kyburgs, and Savoy struggled;\r\nand whence the now mighty house of Habsburg sprang (and domineered)--all\r\nthis before 1291--a country with such a story to tell of its earlier\r\ntimes, we say, should not have that story left untold. Accordingly in\r\nthis volume the history of the period before the formation of the\r\nConfederation has been dwelt upon at some little length. It should be\r\nmentioned, too, that in view of the very general interest caused by the\r\nremarkable discovery of the Swiss lake settlements a few years ago, a\r\nchapter has been devoted to the subject.\r\n\r\nMindful, however, of the superior importance of the formation and\r\nprogress of the Confederation, an endeavour has been made to trace that\r\nprogress step by step, showing how men differing in race, in language,\r\nin creed, and in mode of life, combined to resist the common enemy, and\r\nto build up the compact little state, we now see playing its part on the\r\nEuropean stage. The whole teaching of the history of the country may be\r\nsummed up in Mr. Coolidge's words, in his \"History of the Swiss\r\nConfederation\" (p. 65). \"Swiss history teaches us, all the way through,\r\nthat Swiss liberty has been won by a close union of many small states.\"\r\nAnd Mr. Coolidge adds an opinion that \"it will be best preserved by the\r\nsame means, and not by obliterating all local peculiarities, nowhere so\r\nstriking, nowhere so historically important as in Switzerland.\"\r\n\r\nIt remains to add a few words as to the authorities consulted by the\r\nwriters of this little volume. The standard Swiss histories have\r\nnaturally been largely used, such as those of Dr. Carl Daendliker,\r\nDierauer, Vulliemin, Daguet, Strickler, Voegelin, and Weber (\"Universal\r\nHistory\"). Amongst other histories and miscellaneous writings--essays,\r\npamphlets, and what not--may be mentioned those of Dr. Ferdinand Keller,\r\nWartmann, Heer, Heierli, Von Arx, Mommsen, Burkhardt, Morel, Marquardt,\r\nDahn, Buedinger, Secretan, Von Wyss, Meyer von Knonau, Schweizer,\r\nFinsler, Roget, Baechtold, Marcmonnier, Rambert, Hettner, Scherer,\r\nRoquette, Freytag, Pestalozzi, Schulze, and Kern. Amongst the English\r\nworks consulted are Freeman's writings, the Letters of the Parker\r\nSociety, Adams and Cunningham's \"Swiss Confederation,\" Coolidge's\r\nreprint from the \"Encyclopaedia Britannica\" of the article on the\r\n\"History of the Swiss Confederation,\" Bryce's \"Holy Roman Empire,\" &c.\r\n\r\nThe authors are indebted for most kind and valuable assistance to\r\nseveral eminent Swiss scholars. To Prof. Georg von Wyss and Prof. Meyer\r\nvon Knonau special thanks are due, whilst Prof. Kesselring, Herr J.\r\nHeierli, and others, have shown much helpful interest in the progress of\r\nthe work. They also owe many thanks to Dr. Imhoof, who has most kindly\r\nfurnished them with casts from his famous collection of coins; and to\r\nthe eminent sculptors, Vela and Lanz, who have given permission to use\r\nphotographs of their latest works for illustration purposes.\r\n\r\nZURICH and FOLKESTONE, _July, 1890_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAGE\r\n\r\nPREFACE

What and what manner of men\r\nwere they who first settled on its virgin soil and made it \"home\"? These\r\nquestions naturally present themselves every now and then to most\r\nthoughtful people. And the man with any pretensions to culture feels an\r\ninterest in the history of other countries besides his own.\r\n\r\nBut however interesting these questions as to primary colonizations may\r\nbe, they are usually exactly the most difficult of answer that the\r\nhistory of a country presents. Now and then indeed we may know tolerably\r\nwell the story of some early Greek immigration, or we may possess full\r\naccounts of the modern settlement of a Pitcairn Island; but in far the\r\ngreater number of instances we can but dimly surmise or rashly guess who\r\nand what were the earliest inhabitants of any given region.\r\n\r\nMAP SHOWING THE CHIEF LAKE SETTLEMENTS IN OR NEAR LAKE ZURICH, By Prof.\r\nT. Heierli, Zurich.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Switzerland, however, we are particularly fortunate.\r\n\"Every schoolboy\" has heard of the wonderful discoveries made on the\r\nshores of the beautiful Swiss lakes during the last few years, and the\r\nsame schoolboy even understands, if somewhat hazily, the importance\r\nattaching to these discoveries. Nevertheless, some short account of the\r\nearliest inhabitants of the rugged Helvetia must occupy this first\r\nchapter. And to the general reader some little information as to what\r\nwas found, and how it was found, on the lake shores, may not come amiss.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1853, the waters of Zurich lake sank so low that a wide\r\nstretch of mud was laid bare along the shores. The people of Meilen, a\r\nlarge village some twelve miles from the town of Zurich, took advantage\r\nof this unusual state of things to effect certain improvements, and\r\nduring the operations the workmen's tools struck against some obstacles,\r\nwhich proved to be great wooden props, or piles. These piles, the tops\r\nof which were but a few inches below the surface of the mud, were found\r\nto be planted in rows and squares, and the number of them seemed to be\r\nenormous. And then there were picked out of the mud large numbers of\r\nbones, antlers, weapons, implements of various kinds, and what not. Dr.\r\nFerdinand Keller, a great authority on Helvetian antiquities, was sent\r\nfrom Zurich to examine the spot, and he pronounced it to be a lake\r\nsettlement, probably of some very ancient Celtic tribe. Many marks of a\r\nprehistoric occupation had previously been found, but hitherto no traces\r\nof dwellings. Naturally the news of this important discovery of lake\r\nhabitations caused a great sensation, and gave a great impulse to\r\narchaeological studies. Dr. Keller called these early settlers\r\n_Pfahl-bauer_, or pile-builders, from their peculiar mode of building\r\ntheir houses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (1) DECORATION ON SWORD HILT; (2 AND 3) STONE CELTS,\r\nFOUND IN SWISS LAKE DWELLINGS.\r\n\r\n(_Copied by permission from \"Harper's Magazine.\"_)]\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the last thirty years, over two hundred of these\r\naquatic villages have been discovered--on the shores of the lakes of\r\nConstance, Geneva, Zurich, Neuchatel, Bienne, Morat, and other smaller\r\nlakes, and on certain rivers and swampy spots which had once been lakes\r\nor quasi-lakes. The Alpine lakes, however, with their steep and often\r\ninaccessible banks, show no trace of lake settlements.\r\n\r\nThe lake dwellings are mostly[2] placed on piles driven some 10 feet\r\ninto the bed of the lake, and as many as thirty or forty thousand of\r\nthese piles have been found in a single settlement. The houses\r\nthemselves were made of hurdlework, and thatched with straw or rushes.\r\nLayers of wattles and clay alternating formed the floors, and the walls\r\nseem to have been rendered more weather-proof by a covering of clay, or\r\nelse of bulrushes or straw. A railing of wickerwork ran round each hut,\r\npartly no doubt to keep off the wash of the lake, and partly as a\r\nprotection to the children. Light bridges, or gangways easily moved,\r\nconnected the huts with each other and with the shore. Each house\r\ncontained two rooms at least, and some of the dwellings measured as much\r\nas 27 feet by 22 feet. Hearthstones blackened by fire often remain to\r\nshow where the kitchens had been. Mats of bast, straw, and reeds abound\r\nin the settlements, and show that the lakemen had their notions of\r\ncosiness and comfort. Large crescent-shaped talismans, carved on one\r\nside, were hung over the entrances to the huts, showing pretty clearly\r\nthat the moon-goddess was worshipped. The prehistoric collections in the\r\npublic museums at Zurich, Berne, Bienne, Neuchatel, and Geneva, not to\r\nspeak of private collections, are very extensive and very fine,\r\ncontaining tools, handsome weapons, knives of most exquisite shape and\r\ncarving, women's ornaments, some of them of the most elegant kind. A\r\n\"lady of the lake\" in full dress would seem to have made an imposing\r\nshow. An undergarment of fine linen was girded at the waist by a broad\r\nbelt of inlaid or embossed bronze work. Over the shoulders was thrown a\r\nwoollen cloak fastened with bronze clasps, or pins, whilst neck, arms,\r\nand ankles were decked with a great store of trinkets--necklaces,\r\nanklets, bracelets, rings, spangles, and so forth. The whole was set off\r\nby a diadem of long pins with large heads beautifully chiselled, and\r\ninlaid with beads of metal or glass, these pins being stuck through a\r\nsort of leathern fillet which bound up the hair. So beautiful are some\r\nof the trinkets, that imitations of them in gold are in request by the\r\nladies of to-day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (1) VESSEL; (2) SPECIMENS OF WOVEN FABRICS FOUND IN SWISS\r\nLAKE DWELLINGS.\r\n\r\n(_Copied by permission from \"Harper's Magazine.\"_)]\r\n\r\nIt is curious to find that one of the most extensive lake colonies in\r\nSwitzerland is situated in and spread over the vast marshes of\r\nRobenhausen (Zurich) which once formed part of Lake Pfaeffikon. The\r\nvisitor who is not deterred by the inconvenience of a descent into a\r\ndamp and muddy pit some 11 feet deep, where excavations are still being\r\ncarried on, finds himself facing three successive settlements, one above\r\nanother, and all belonging to the remote stone age. Between the\r\nsuccessive settlements are layers of turf, some 3 feet thick, the growth\r\nof many centuries. The turf itself is covered by a stratum of sticky\r\nmatter, 4 inches thick. In this are numbers of relics embedded, both\r\ndestructible and indestructible objects being perfectly well preserved,\r\nthe former kept from decay through having been charred by fire. The late\r\nProfessor Heer discovered and analysed remains of more than a hundred\r\ndifferent kinds of plants. Grains, and even whole ears of wheat and\r\nbarley, seeds of strawberries and raspberries, dried apples, textile\r\nfabrics, implements, hatchets of nephrite--this mineral and the Oriental\r\ncereals show clearly enough that the lakemen traded with the East,\r\nthough no doubt through the Mediterranean peoples--spinning-wheels,\r\ncorn-squeezers, floorings, fragmentary walls--all these are found in\r\nplenty, in each of the three layers. The topmost settlement, however,\r\ncontains no destructible matters, such as corn, fruits, &c. This is to\r\nbe accounted for by the fact that the two lower settlements were\r\ndestroyed by fire, and the uppermost one by the growth of the turf, or\r\nby the rising marshes. In the latter case there was no friendly action\r\nof fire to preserve the various objects.\r\n\r\nThe scholar's mind is at once carried back to the account given by\r\nHerodotus of Thrakian lake-dwellers.[3] The people of this tribe, he\r\ntells us, built their houses over water, so as to gain facilities for\r\nfishing. They used to let down baskets through trapdoors in the floors\r\nof their huts, and these baskets rapidly filled with all kinds of fish\r\nthat had gathered around, tempted by the droppings of food.\r\n\r\nThough the lakemen depended chiefly on the water for their supply of\r\nfood, yet they were hunters, and great tillers of the ground as well as\r\nfishermen. They grew wheat and barley, and kept horses, cattle, sheep,\r\nand goats. The women spun flax and wool, and wove them into fabrics for\r\nclothing. Their crockery was at first of a very primitive description,\r\nbeing made of black clay, and showing but little finish or artistic\r\ndesign. But the children were not forgotten, for they were supplied with\r\ntiny mugs and cups.[4]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPECIMENS OF POTTERY FOUND IN SWISS LAKE DWELLINGS.\r\n\r\n(_Copied by permission from \"Harper's Magazine.\"_)]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the date when the immigration of lakemen began the\r\nsavants are hopelessly at variance. Nor do they agree any better as to\r\nthe dates of the stone and bronze epochs into which the history of the\r\nlake settlements divides itself. But as in some of the marshy stations\r\nthese two epochs reach on to the age of iron, it is assumed by many\r\nauthorities that the lake dwellers lived on to historical times. This is\r\nparticularly shown in the alluvial soil and marshes between the lakes of\r\nNeuchatel and Bienne, Prefargier being one of the chief stations, where\r\nsettlements belonging to the stone, bronze, and iron ages are found\r\nranged one above another in chronological order. In the topmost stratum\r\nor colony, the lakemen's wares are found mingling pell-mell with iron\r\nand bronze objects of Helvetian and Roman make, a fact sufficient,\r\nprobably, to show that the lake dwellers associated with historical\r\npeoples. It would be useless as well as tedious to set forth at length\r\nall the theories prevailing as to the origin and age of the lake\r\ndwellings. Suffice it to say that, by some authorities, the commencement\r\nof the stone period is placed at six thousand, and by others at three\r\nthousand years before the Christian era, the latter being probably\r\nnearest the truth. As to the age of bronze, we may safely assign it to\r\n1100-1000 B.C., for Professor Heer proves conclusively that the time of\r\nHomer--the Greek age of bronze--was contemporary with the bronze epoch\r\nof the lakemen.[5]\r\n\r\nThe Lake period would seem to have drawn to a close about 600-700 B.C.,\r\nwhen the age of bronze was superseded by that of iron. According to the\r\nmost painstaking investigations made by Mr. Heierli, of Zurich, now the\r\ngreatest authority on the subject in Switzerland, the lakemen left their\r\nwatery settlements about the date just given, and began to fix their\r\nhabitations on _terra firma_. Various tombs already found on land would\r\nbear witness to this change. When these peculiar people had once come on\r\nshore to live they would be gradually absorbed into neighbouring and\r\nsucceeding races, no doubt into some of the Celtic tribes, and most\r\nlikely into the Helvetian peoples. Thus they have their part, however\r\nsmall it may be, in the history of the Swiss nation. It must be added\r\nthat the Pfahl-bauer are no longer held to have been a Celtic people,\r\nbut are thought to have belonged to some previous race, though which has\r\nnot as yet been ascertained.\r\n\r\nBut enough has been written on the subject, perhaps. Yet, on the other\r\nhand, it would have been impossible to pass over the lakemen in silence,\r\nespecially now when the important discoveries of similar lake\r\nsettlements in East Yorkshire have drawn to the subject the attention of\r\nall intelligent English-speaking people.[6]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] There are two distinct kinds of settlement, but we are here dealing\r\nwith the first or earlier kind.\r\n\r\n[3] Herod, v. 16.\r\n\r\n[4] The lake tribes of the bronze age, however, not only understood the\r\nuse of copper and bronze, but were far more proficient in the arts than\r\ntheir predecessors. Some of the textile fabrics found are of the most\r\ncomplicated weaving, and some of the bronze articles are of most\r\nexquisite chiselling, though these were probably imported from Italy,\r\nwith which country the lake dwellers would seem to have had considerable\r\ntraffic. The earliest specimens of pottery are usually ornamented by\r\nmere rude nail scratchings, but those of the bronze period have had\r\ntheir straight lines and curves made by a graving tool. In fact, the\r\nlater tribes had become lovers of art for its own sake, and even the\r\nsmallest articles of manufacture were decorated with designs of more or\r\nless elaboration and finish.\r\n\r\n[5] The products of the soil seem to have been the same amongst the\r\nlakemen as amongst Homer's people. Both knew barley and wheat, and\r\nneither of them knew rye. In their mode of dressing and preparing barley\r\nfor food the two peoples concurred. It was not made into bread, but\r\nroasted to bring off the husk. And roasted barley is still a favourite\r\narticle of diet in the Lower Engadine. The Greeks ate it at their\r\nsacrifices, and always took supplies of it when starting on a journey.\r\nSo Telemachus asks his old nurse Eurykleia to fill his goat skin with\r\nroasted barley when he sets out in search of his father. And young Greek\r\nbrides were required to complete the stock of household belongings by\r\nproviding on their marriage day a roasting vessel for barley.\r\n\r\n[6] Those who wish to see pretty well all that can be said on the matter\r\nshould read the valuable article in _The Westminster Review_, for June,\r\n1887.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nTHE HELVETIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of a country often includes the history of many peoples, for\r\nhistory is a stage on which nations and peoples figure like individual\r\ncharacters, playing their parts and making their exits, others stepping\r\ninto their places. And so the Swiss soil has been trodden by many\r\npossessors--Celts, Rhaetians, Alamanni, Burgundians, Franks. These have\r\nall made their mark upon and contributed to the history of the Swiss\r\nnation, and must all figure in the earlier portions of our story.\r\n\r\nDim are the glimpses we catch of the early condition of the Helvetians,\r\nbut the mist that enshrouds this people clears, though slowly, at the\r\nend of the second century before Christ, when they came into close\r\ncontact with the Romans who chronicled their deeds. The Helvetians\r\nthemselves, indeed, though not ignorant of the art of writing, were far\r\ntoo much occupied in warfare to be painstaking annalists. At the\r\nCelto-Roman period of which we are treating, Helvetia comprised all the\r\nterritory lying between Mount Jura, Lake Geneva, and Lake Constance,\r\nwith the exception of Basle, which included Graubuenden, and reached into\r\nSt. Gall and Glarus. It was parcelled out amongst many tribes, even as\r\nit is in our own day. The Helvetians, who had previously occupied all\r\nthe land between the Rhine and the Main, had been driven south by the\r\nadvancing Germans, and had colonized the fertile plains and the lower\r\nhill grounds of Switzerland, leaving to others the more difficult Alpine\r\nregions. They split into four tribes, of which we know the names of\r\nthree--the Tigurini, Toygeni, and Verbigeni. The first named seem to\r\nhave settled about Lake Morat, with Aventicum (Avenches) as their\r\ncapital. Basle was the seat of the Rauraci; to the west of Neuchatel was\r\nthat of the Sequani; whilst Geneva belonged to the wild Allobroges. The\r\nValais[7] district was inhabited by four different clans, and was known\r\nas the \"Poenine valley,\" on account of the worship of Poeninus on\r\nthe Great St. Bernard, where was a temple to the deity. In the Ticino\r\nwere the Lepontines, a Ligurian tribe whose name still lingers in\r\n\"Lepontine Alps.\" The mountain fastnesses of the Grisons (Graubuenden)\r\nwere held by the hardy Rhaetians, a Tuscan tribe, who, once overcome by\r\nthe Romans, speedily adopted their speech and customs. Romansh, a\r\ncorrupt Latin, holds its own to this day in the higher and remoter\r\nvalleys of that canton.\r\n\r\nAll these tribes, except the two last mentioned, belonged to the great\r\nand martial family of the Celts, and of them all the wealthiest, the\r\nmost valiant, and the most conspicuous were the Helvetians.[8] Of the\r\nlife and disposition of these Helvetians we know but little, but no\r\ndoubt they bore the general stamp of the Celts. They managed the javelin\r\nmore skilfully than the plough, and to their personal courage it is\r\nrather than to their skill in tactics that they owe their reputation as\r\ngreat warriors. But in course of time their character was greatly\r\nmodified, and, owing probably to their secluded position, they settled\r\ndown into more peaceful habits, and rose to wealth and honour, combining\r\nwith their great powers a certain amount of culture. They practised the\r\nart of writing, having adopted the Greek alphabet, and gold, which was\r\npossibly found in their rivers, circulated freely amongst them. To judge\r\nfrom the relics found in Helvetian tumuli the Helvetians were fond of\r\nluxuries in the way of ornaments and fine armour, and they excelled in\r\nthe art of working metals, especially bronze. They had made some\r\nprogress in agriculture, and in the construction of their houses, and\r\nmore especially of the walls that guarded their towns, which struck the\r\nRomans by their neatness and practicalness. Nor would this be to be\r\nwondered at if the old legends could be trusted, which tell us that\r\nHercules himself taught the Helvetians to build, and likewise gave them\r\ntheir laws; an allusion, no doubt, to the fact that culture came to them\r\nfrom the east, from the peoples around the Mediterranean. Besides many\r\nhamlets, they had founded no fewer than four hundred villages and twelve\r\ntowns, and seem to have been well able to select for their settlements\r\nthe most picturesque and convenient spots. For many of their place-names\r\nhave come down to us, in some cases but little changed. Thus of colonies\r\nwe have Zuricum (Zurich), Salodurum (Soleure), Vindonissa (Windisch),\r\nLousonium (Lausanne), and Geneva; of rivers navigable or otherwise\r\nuseful, Rhine, Rhone, Aar, Reuss, Thur; of mountains, Jura and perhaps\r\nCamor. Disliking the hardships of Alpine life the Helvetians left the\r\ngiant mountains to a sturdier race.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHANNISSTEIN, WITH RUINS OF CASTLE OF \"HOHENRHAETIA,\"\r\nNEAR THUSIS, GRAUBUeNDEN.\r\n\r\n(_From a Photograph._)]\r\n\r\nThe nature of their political code was republican, yet it was largely\r\ntinctured with elements of an aristocratic kind. Their nobles were\r\nwealthy landed proprietors, with numerous vassals, attendants, and\r\nslaves. In case their lord was impeached these retainers would take his\r\npart before the popular tribunal. The case of Orgetorix may be cited. He\r\nwas a dynastic leader, and head over one hundred valley settlements; his\r\nname appears on Helvetian silver coins as Orcitrix. He was brought to\r\ntrial on a charge of aspiring to the kingship, and no fewer than a\r\nthousand followers appeared at the court to clear him, but _vox populi\r\nvox dei_, and the popular vote prevailed. Orgetorix was sentenced to die\r\nby fire, a punishment awarded to all who encroached upon the popular\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nTheir form of religion was most probably that common to all the Celts,\r\nDruidical worship. Invested with power, civil and spiritual, the Druids\r\nheld absolute sway over the superstitious Celtic tribes. Proud as the\r\nCelts were of their independence, they yet were incapable of governing\r\nthemselves because of the perpetual dissensions amongst the tribes; and\r\nthey were overawed by the intellectual superiority of a priesthood that\r\nprofessed all the sciences of the age--medicine, astrology, soothsaying,\r\nnecromancy--and had taken into its hands the education of the young. The\r\ncommon people were mere blind devotees, and rendered unquestioning\r\nobedience to the decrees of the Druids. Druidism was, in fact, the only\r\npower which could move the whole Celtic race, and could knit together\r\nthe Celts of the Thames and those of the Garonne and Rhone, when they\r\nmet at the great yearly convocation at Chartres, then the \"Metropolis of\r\nthe Earth.\" Human sacrifice was one of the most cruel and revolting\r\nfeatures of the Druidical religion.\r\n\r\nThe Celts were a peculiarly gifted people, though differing greatly from\r\nthe contemporary Greeks and Romans. They had been a governing race\r\nbefore the Romans appeared on the stage, and wrested from them the\r\nleading part. They had overrun the whole world, so to speak, casting\r\nabout for a fixed home, and spread as far as the British Isles, making\r\nGaul their religious and political centre, and settled down into more\r\npeaceful habits. Driven by excess of population, or their unquenchable\r\nthirst for war, or simply their nomadic habits--one cannot otherwise\r\naccount for their retrogression--they migrated eastwards whence they\r\ncame--to Italy, Greece, and Asia Minor--demanding territory, and\r\nstriking terror into every nation they approached by their warlike\r\nhabits. They knocked at the gates of Rome, and the Galatians were\r\nconspicuous by their atrocities.[9] Brilliant qualities and great\r\nnational faults had been their peculiar characteristics. Quick-witted\r\nthey were, highly intelligent, ingenious, frank, versatile; attaching\r\nmuch value to _gloire_, and _esprit_; susceptible of and accessible to\r\nevery impression, skilled handicraftsmen; but inclined to be vain,\r\nboastful, and fickle-minded, averse to order and discipline, and lacking\r\nin perseverance and moral energy. This, according to both ancient and\r\nmodern writers, was their character. They failed to create a united\r\nempire, and to resist their deadly enemy, Rome.\r\n\r\nWhat they did excel in was fighting. Dressed in gaudy costume--wide\r\ntunic, bright plaid, and toga embroidered with silver and gold--the\r\nCeltic noble would fight by preference in single combat, to show off to\r\npersonal advantage, but in the brunt of battle he threw away his\r\nclothing to fight unimpeded. Bituitus, king of the Arverni, attired in\r\nmagnificent style, mounts his silver chariot, and, preceded by a harper\r\nand a pack of hounds, goes to meet Caesar in battle, and win his respect\r\nand admiration.\r\n\r\nThe Helvetians were peaceful neighbours to Italy so long as they did not\r\ncome into direct contact with the Romans, but on the Rhine they were\r\nengaged in daily feuds with the German tribes, who had driven them from\r\ntheir settlements in the Black Forest, and had continued their raids\r\nbeyond the river. For the sake of plunder, or from mere restless habits,\r\nthe Germans had left their northern homes on the Baltic and North Seas,\r\nthe Cimbri, and their brethren, the Teutons and others, and were slowly\r\nmoving southward, repelling or being in turn repelled. The most daring\r\ncrossed the Rhine, and made their way straight through the lands of the\r\nBelgians and Helvetians towards the South, thereby anticipating the\r\ngreat dislocation of peoples which was to take place but five hundred\r\nyears later, when the Roman Empire, sapped at the root, crumbled to\r\npieces, unable longer to resist the tide of barbarian invasion.\r\n\r\nOn one of these expeditions the Cimbri, giving a glowing account of\r\nsunny Gaul, and the booty to be obtained there, were joined by the\r\nHelvetian Tigurini, whose leader was the young and fiery Divico (B.C.\r\n107). They started with the intention of founding a new home in the\r\nprovince of the Nitiobroges in Southern Gaul; but when they had reached\r\nthat territory they were suddenly stopped on the banks of the Garonne by\r\na Roman army under the consul Cassius and his lieutenant Piso. But,\r\nlittle impressed by the military fame of the Romans, the Tigurini, lying\r\nin ambush, gave battle to the forces of great Rome, and utterly routed\r\nthem at Agen, on the Garonne, between Bordeaux and Toulouse. It was a\r\nbrilliant victory; both the Roman leaders and the greater part of their\r\nmen were slain, and the rest begged for their lives. The proud Romans\r\nwere under the humiliating necessity of giving hostages and passing\r\nunder the yoke--a stain on the Roman honour not to be forgotten; but the\r\nvictors, being anything but diplomats, knew no better use to make of\r\ntheir splendid victory than to wander about for a time and then go home\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nA few years later (102 and 101 B.C.) the Tigurini, Toygeni, Cimbri, and\r\nTeutons joined their forces on a last expedition southwards. The\r\nexpedition ended in the destruction of these German tribes. The Toygeni\r\nperished in the fearful carnage at Aquae Sextiae, and the Cimbri later on\r\nat Vercellae. When the Tigurini heard of this last-mentioned disaster\r\nthey returned home.\r\n\r\nCaesar had been appointed governor of the Province (Provence) which\r\nextended to Geneva, the very door of Helvetia; on the Rhine the Germans\r\ncontinued to make their terrible inroads. Thus there was but little\r\nscope for the stirring Helvetians, and the soil afforded but a scanty\r\nsupply of food; so they turned their eyes wistfully in the direction of\r\nfair Gaul. Meeting in council they decided on a general migration,\r\nleaving their country to whoever might like to take it. Then rose up\r\nOrgetorix, one of their wealthiest nobles, and supported the plan,\r\nvolunteering to secure a free passage through the neighbouring provinces\r\nof the Allobroges and AEdui. The 28th of March, B.C. 58, was the day\r\nfixed for the departure, and Geneva was to be the meeting-place; thence\r\nthey were to proceed through the territory of the Allobroges. For two\r\nyears previously they were to get ready their provisions, and to collect\r\ncarts, horses, and oxen, but before the period had expired Orgetorix was\r\naccused of treason, and being unable to clear himself, put an end to his\r\nown life to escape public obloquy. This episode made no difference in\r\nthe general plan. The Helvetians, indeed, insisted on its being carried\r\nout. Setting fire to their towns and villages to prevent men from\r\nreturning, they started on their adventurous journey on that spring morn\r\nof 58 B.C. Caesar's figures seem very large, but, if he is to be\r\ntrusted, the tribes numbered some 368,000 men, of which 263,000 were\r\nHelvetians, the rest being neighbours of theirs. But 93,000 were capable\r\nof bearing arms.\r\n\r\nA curious yet thrilling sight must have been that motley caravan of\r\nprodigious proportions--ten thousand carts drawn by forty thousand oxen,\r\ncarrying women, children, and the old men; riders and armour-bearers\r\nalongside, toiling painfully through woods and fords, and up and down\r\nrugged hills; behind the emigrants the smoking and smouldering ruins of\r\nthe homes they were leaving with but little regret. Yet they were no\r\nmere adventurers, but looked forward with swelling hearts to a brighter\r\ntime and a more prosperous home. Arriving at Geneva they found the\r\nbridge over the Rhone broken up by Caesar's order. Caesar was, in truth, a\r\nfactor they had not reckoned upon, and, after useless attempts to make\r\nheadway, they turned their steps towards Mount Jura, and whilst they\r\nwere toiling over the steep and rugged Pas de l'Ecluse, Caesar returned\r\nto Italy to gather together his legions. Returning to Gaul he arrived\r\njust in time to see the Helvetians cross the Arar (Saone) with the\r\nutmost difficulty. The Tigurini were the last to cross. And on them\r\nCaesar fell and cut them down, thus avenging the death of Piso--the\r\ngreat-grandfather of Caesar's wife--and wiping out the stain on the\r\nhonour of the Roman arms. His legions crossed the Saone in twenty-four\r\nhours, and this performance so excited the admiration of the Helvetians,\r\nwho had themselves taken twenty days to cross, that they condescended\r\nto send legates to treat with Caesar for a free passage. They promised\r\nhim that they would do no harm to any one if he would comply with the\r\nrequest, but threatened that if he should intercept them he might have\r\nto see something of their ancient bravery. No threats or entreaties were\r\nof avail, however, with such a man as Caesar, who, smiling at their naive\r\nsimplicity, asked them to gives hostages as a sign of confirmation of\r\ntheir promise. \"Hostages!\" cried Divico, the hero of of Agen, in a rage,\r\n\"the Helvetians are not accustomed to give hostages; they have been\r\ntaught by their fathers to receive hostages, and this the Romans must\r\nwell remember.\" So saying he walked away.\r\n\r\nThe Helvetians continued their march, Caesar following at a distance,\r\nwatching for an opportunity of attacking them. At Bibracte, an important\r\ncity of Gaul (now Mont Beuvray), west of Autun in Burgundy, the\r\nopportunity offered itself. Caesar seized a hill and posted his troops\r\nthere, and charged the enemy with his cavalry. The Helvetians fiercely\r\nrepulsed the attack, and poured on the Roman front, but were quite\r\nunable to stand against the showers of the Roman pila, which often\r\npenetrated several shields at once, and thus fastened them together so\r\nthat they could not be disentangled. Disconcerted by this unexpected\r\nresult, the Helvetians were soon discomfited by the sharp attack with\r\nswords which instantly followed. Retiring for a while to a hill close\r\nby, the barbarians again drew up in battle order, and again descended to\r\ncombat. Long and fierce was the struggle which followed; the Helvetians\r\nfighting like lions till the evening, never once turning their backs on\r\nthe enemy. This is Caesar's own report. But barbarian heroism was no\r\nmatch for the regular, well-organized, and highly-trained Roman army,\r\nand once more driven back, they withdrew to the hill where had been left\r\ntheir wives and children with the baggage. From this place they ventured\r\nto make a last resistance, and they drew up their carts in the form of a\r\ndeep square, leaving room in the middle for the non-combatants and the\r\nbaggage. Then mounting their extemporized fort--the so-called\r\nWagenburg--the Helvetian men commenced the fray, even their women and\r\nchildren hurling javelins at the enemy. Not till midnight did the Romans\r\nseize and enter on the rude rampart, and when they did the clashing of\r\narms had ceased. All the valiant defenders lay slain at their feet, and\r\nthe spirit of bold independence of the Helvetians was crushed for ever.\r\n\r\nAfter this fearful disaster the rest of the emigrants, to the number of\r\n110,000, continued their march through Gaul, but lacking both food and\r\ncapable leaders, and being moreover ill-used by the Gauls, they sent to\r\nCaesar for help. He demanded hostages, and ordered them to return home\r\nand rebuild their towns and villages. And, further, he supplied them\r\nwith food for the journey, and requested the Allobroges to do the same\r\nwhen the Helvetians should arrive in their province. Caesar admits that\r\nthis apparent generosity on his part was dictated not by compassion, but\r\nby policy. It was to his interest that these barbarians should re-occupy\r\nHelvetia, because they would keep watch on the Rhine, and prevent the\r\nirruption of the Germans into the country. In their condition now, he\r\ncalls the Helvetians ASSOCIATES (_foederati_), and not SUBJECTS, and\r\nleaves them their own constitution, and, to some extent, their freedom.\r\nBut they did not relish this forced friendship, which was indeed more\r\nlike bondage; and when the Celts of Gaul rose in revolt under the noble\r\nand beloved Vercingetorix, who had been a friend of Caesar, they joined\r\ntheir brethren (52 B.C.), and were again vanquished. On the defeat of\r\nthe Helvetians at Bibracte followed that of the Valisians, in 57 B.C. To\r\nestablish a direct communication between Central Gaul and Italy, Caesar\r\ntook those same measures which Napoleon I. employed long afterwards; he\r\nconquered the Valais (by his lieutenant Galba), that he might secure the\r\npassage of the Great St. Bernard. A splendid road was formed over Mount\r\nPoeninus, and a temple erected to Jupiter Poeninus, where the\r\ntraveller left votive tablets as a thanksgiving offering after a\r\nfortunate ascent.\r\n\r\nThe subjugation of Rhaetia was delayed for more than a generation. To\r\nguard the empire against the Eastern hordes; against the mountain\r\nrobbers of Graubuenden and the Tyrol, who descended into the valleys of\r\nthe Po, ravaging the country as far as Milan, and no doubt liberally\r\npaying back in their own coin, the Romans who had made from time to time\r\nsuch havoc in the Alpine homes--to guard against these, and the wild\r\nVindelicians of Bavaria, Augustus sent the two imperial princes to\r\nreduce them to subjection. Drusus marched into the Tyrol, whilst\r\nTiberius advanced on Lake Constance, where even the Rhaetian women\r\nengaged in the conflict, and, in default of missiles, hurled their\r\nsucking children into the face of the conquerors, through sheer\r\nexasperation. Their savage courage availed them nothing, however; the\r\nincursions from the East were repressed; and once the Rhaetians were\r\novercome, they became the most useful of auxiliaries to the Roman army.\r\nHorace's ode to Drusus alludes to the Rhaetian campaign.\r\n\r\nThe Rhaeto-Roman inhabitants of Graubuenden--for they still occupy the\r\nhigh valleys of the Engadine and of the Vorder-Rhine--present much\r\ninterest in point of language and antiquities. The sturdy Rhaetians\r\nbelonged to the art-loving Etruscan race, whose proficiency in the\r\n_amphora-technic_ we so highly value. An old legend calls their ancestor\r\nRaetus a Tuscan. And not without show of reason, says Mommsen, for the\r\nearly dwellers of Graubuenden and the Tyrol were Tuscans, and spoke a\r\ndialect agreeing with that of the district of Mantua, a Tuscan colony in\r\nthe time of Livy. In Graubuenden and Ticino were found, some thirty years\r\nago, stones bearing inscriptions in that dialect. The Rhaetians may have\r\ndropped behind in these Alpine regions on the immigration of Etruscans\r\ninto the valleys of the Po; or, they may just as likely have fled there\r\non the advent of the Celts, when that warlike race seized on the fertile\r\nplains of the river, and drove the Etruscans from their home southward\r\nand northward. Be that as it may, however, it is certain that the\r\nRhaetians, once blended with the Romans, have preserved the Latin tongue\r\nand customs to this day, for Romaunsh a corrupt Latin, with no doubt\r\nsome admixture of Tuscan, is still spoken by more than one-third of the\r\npopulation of the Grisons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSE (FORMERLY CHAPLE) IN THE ROMAUNSH STYLE, AT SCHULS,\r\nLOWER ENGADINE, GRAUBUeNDEN.\r\n\r\n(_After a Photograph by Guler_.)]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] Valais (German, _Wallis_) means valley, and is so called from its\r\nbeing a long narrow dale or vale hemmed in by lofty mountains.\r\n\r\n[8] Mommsen, \"Roman History,\" vol. ii. p. 166.\r\n\r\n[9] \"Story of Alexander's Empire,\" by Mahaffy, p. 79.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nHELVETIA UNDER THE ROMANS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILVER COIN, VERCINGETORIX.\r\n\r\n(_Dr. Imhoof, Winterthur._)]\r\n\r\nOn the surrender of the noble Vercingetorix, a valiant knight, but no\r\nstatesman--he delivered himself up to Caesar, trusting in his generosity\r\non the plea of former friendship, and died a prisoner of Rome--the war\r\nwith Gaul was virtually at an end. The sporadic risings that followed\r\nlacked the spirit of union, and led to no results of any consequence.\r\nDuring the seven years of his governorship in Gaul (58-51 B.C.), Caesar\r\nhad completed the subjection of the entire country, with the exception\r\nof the province of Narbonensis, whose conquest was of more ancient date.\r\nHe followed up his victories, and secured their results by organizing a\r\nline of secure defences on the northern boundary of Gaul, along the\r\nRhine, creating thereby a new system of open defences--defences\r\noffensive, so to speak--which he sketched out with full details, and\r\nmade Gaul herself a bulwark against the inroads of the aggressive\r\nGermans. To secure peace and voluntary submission, he also regulated the\r\ninternal affairs of the new province, leaving her, however, most of her\r\nold national institutions, hoping by conciliatory measures to gradually\r\nbring her under Roman influences, and win her to side with Rome. But it\r\nwas left to others to carry out his plans, the Emperor Augustus being\r\nthe first to put them into practice; for civil war was again threatening\r\nItaly, and Caesar returned home to carry on his great contest with Pompey\r\nfor supremacy in the State.\r\n\r\nAlthough Caesar's plans were but a sketch they were faithfully carried\r\nout, and the Gallic conquest proved to be more, and aimed higher, than\r\nthe mere subjection of the Celts. Caesar was not only a great general,\r\nbut also a far-seeing politician. He had clearly understood that the\r\nbarbarian Germans might well prove more than a match for the Greek-Latin\r\nworld if they came into close contact with it. His defeat of Ariovistus,\r\nwho was on the point of forming a German kingdom in Gaul, and his wise\r\nmeasures of defence, kept the barbarian hordes at bay for centuries, and\r\nthus there was ample time given for the Greek-Latin culture to take root\r\nthroughout the West. It happened consequently that when Rome could no\r\nlonger offer any serious resistance, and the Germans poured into her\r\nlands, the people of the West were already Romanized, and those of\r\nGaul, Britain, and Spain, became the medium of transmitting to the\r\nGermans the spirit of classicism, by which they would otherwise have\r\nhardly been affected; and those nations became the connecting link\r\nbetween the classical age and the German era which absorbed its\r\nhigh-wrought culture. If Alexander may be said to have spread Hellenism\r\nover the East; Caesar may be taken to have done as much, and indeed\r\nvastly more for the West, for it is owing to him, though we can scarcely\r\nrealize the fact in our day, that the German race is imbued with the\r\nspirit of classical antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Caesar, and the state of anarchy that followed again, delayed\r\nthe work of pacification, and Helvetia was left to take care of herself.\r\nBut when Augustus was firmly seated on the imperial throne, he resumed\r\nthe task which had been bequeathed to him. The organization of Gaul was\r\nchiefly his work, and it required an energetic yet moderate policy. The\r\nold Narbonensis district, which had long been moulded into a Roman\r\nprovince, was placed under senatorial control. New Gaul, or Gallia\r\nComata (_Gaule Chevelue_), as the whole territory was called which Caesar\r\nhad conquered, was submitted to imperial authority, and treated more\r\nadequately in accordance with the ancient constitutions of the various\r\ntribes. To facilitate taxation and administration New Gaul was divided\r\ninto three provinces, each ruled by a Roman governor. Of these three\r\nprovinces, one was Belgica, extending from the Seine and the mouth of\r\nthe Rhine to Lake Constance, thus including Helvetia proper. Belgica, on\r\naccount of its size, was subdivided into three commands, in one of\r\nwhich, that of Upper Germany, Helvetia found itself placed. Thus we\r\nfind Helvetia incorporated with Gaul.\r\n\r\nThe political capital of the Tres Galliae, or Three Gauls, was Lugdunum\r\n(Lyons), owing to its central position, and it seems to have been a very\r\nimportant city. Here Drusus had raised an altar to his imperial father,\r\nAugustus, and the Genius of the City. Here met the representatives of\r\nthe sixty-four Gallic states (including those of the Helvetians and the\r\nRauraci) on the anniversary of the emperor. Here, too, was the seat of\r\nthe Gallic Diet; and here, in the amphitheatre, took place rhetorical\r\ncontests, the Celts holding eloquence in high honour.\r\n\r\nEastern Switzerland, that is, Graubuenden, and the land around Lake\r\nWallenstatt, as far as Lake Constance, was joined with Rhaetia, which\r\nlikewise included, amongst other districts, the Tyrol and Southern\r\nBavaria. The whole of this territory was ruled by a governor residing at\r\nAugusta Vindelicorum (Augsburg). The Valais district was joined to some\r\npart of Savoy, and ruled by the procurator of the Poenine Alps. Ticino\r\ndoes not concern us here, as it remained a portion of Italy down to the\r\nsixteenth century.\r\n\r\nYet though thus arbitrarily made a part of Gaul, Helvetia formed a\r\nprovince of itself, and had its own history and kept its own\r\nconstitution, thanks to Caesar's wise and generous policy, by which he\r\nprovided that the Celts should not be interfered with in their method of\r\ngoverning by tribes (_pagi_ or _civitates_), nor in their constitution,\r\nso long as it did not clash with the Roman laws. When Caesar had defeated\r\nthe Helvetians he sent them back to rebuild their old homes, and they\r\nre-occupied their ancient territory, with the exception of that portion\r\nwhich stretches from Fort l'Ecluse to Geneva and Aubonne, and borders on\r\nMount Jura. This portion was wrenched away and given to the Equestrian\r\nJulian colony settled at Noviodunum (Nyon) on Geneva lake, to keep the\r\npasses of the mountain (43 B.C.). The Jura range separated Helvetia from\r\nthe territory of the Rauraci, where another veteran colony was about the\r\nsame time established as a safeguard for the Rhine, to check the\r\nincursions of the Germans. The Colonia Rauracorum was afterwards called\r\nAugusta Rauracorum in honour of the emperor. The colonists of these two\r\nsettlements were mostly Romans, or had been admitted to Roman\r\ncitizenship, and occupied a different position from the inhabitants of\r\nthe country generally, for they were allowed Roman privileges and\r\nfavours--exemption from taxation most likely amongst others--but, on the\r\nother hand, they were entirely dependent on the Roman Government.\r\n\r\nThe laborious investigations of the learned Mommsen and Charles Morel go\r\nto show that the Helvetians were mildly treated by their masters. They\r\nhad been received into the Roman pale as friends (_foederati_), and as\r\nsuch lived on favourable terms with these, and enjoyed as high a degree\r\nof liberty and autonomy as was compatible with their position as Roman\r\nsubjects. The Rhaetians had been taken from their country; the Helvetii,\r\non the contrary, had been sent back home and entrusted with the\r\nguardianship of the Rhine, merely being required to furnish a\r\ncontingent for service abroad. They were allowed to maintain garrisons\r\nof their own--that of Tenedo on the Rhine, for instance--to build forts,\r\nto raise militia in case of war. And, as has before been mentioned,\r\ntheir religious worship was not interfered with, nor their traditional\r\ndivision into _pagi_, or tribes, and they were allowed a national\r\nrepresentative at the Gallic capital, Lyons. Helvetia took the rank of a\r\nstate (_Civitas Helvetiorum_), its chief seat (_chef-lieu_) being\r\nAventicum, which was also the centre of government. So long as Helvetia\r\nconformed to the regulations imposed by the imperial government she was\r\nallowed to manage her own local affairs. Latin was made the official\r\nlanguage, though the native tongue was not prohibited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOLD COIN, VESPASIAN (VESPASIANUS IMPERATOR-AETERNITAS).\r\n\r\n(_By Dr. Imhoof, Winterthur._)]\r\n\r\nA.D. 69-79. Under Vespasian, however, a great change took place. Thanks\r\nto the munificence of that emperor, who had a great liking for\r\nAventicum, this city lost its Celtic character, and was made a splendid\r\ncity after the Italian type. He had sent there his befriended and\r\nfaithful Flavian colony of the Helvetians to live, giving her the\r\nlengthy title of Colonia Pia Flavia Constans Emerita Helvetiorum\r\nFoederata in return for services, for she had staunchly supported his\r\nparty against Vitellius when the latter contended with Galba for the\r\nimperial throne. The inhabitants most likely received the Latin Right\r\n(_Droit Latin_), or were considered Roman citizens, and as such were\r\nmore intimately connected with Rome, and had to submit to closer\r\ncontrol. Her institutions were assimilated to those of Italian towns.\r\nShe had a senate, a council of decuriones, city magistrates, a\r\n_praefectus operum publicorum_ (or special officer to attend to the\r\nconstruction of public buildings), Augustan flamens, or priests, and so\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the overwhelming importance of Aventicum, a certain\r\namount of self-government was left to the country districts, towns, and\r\nvillages (_vici_). The inhabitants of Vindonissa (Windisch), Aquae\r\n(Baden), Eburodunum (Yverdon), Salodurum (Soleure), erected public\r\nbuildings of their own accord. The towns of the Valais, Octodurum\r\n(Martigny), Sedunum (Sion), &c., had their own city council and\r\nmunicipal officers, and received the Latin Right. In the case of the\r\nHelvetians, those of the capital and those of the provinces equally\r\nenjoyed that Right; whereas, with Augusta Rauracorum, the case was\r\ndifferent, only the colonists within the walled cities being granted the\r\nlike standing and liberties. On the whole it may be said that, though\r\nHelvetia kept many of her own peculiarities, and some of her ancient\r\nliberties, she submitted to Rome, and was greatly influenced by the\r\nadvanced civilization of the empire. The Helvetians, indeed, underwent\r\nthat change of speech and character, which split them into two nations,\r\nFrench and Germans.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief factors contributing to the Roman colonization of\r\nHelvetia was the military occupation of its northern frontier, though\r\nthis occupation weighed heavily on the country. The great object of Rome\r\nwas to keep back the Germans, who were for ever threatening to break\r\ninto the empire. Vindonissa was one of the military headquarters, and\r\nits selection for the purpose was justified by its excellent position,\r\nsituated as it was on an elevated neck of land, washed by three\r\nnavigable rivers, the Aare, Reuss, and Limmat, and at the junction of\r\nthe two great roads connecting East and West Helvetia with Italy. A\r\ncapital system of roads, too, was planned all over the country.\r\n\r\nThere would no doubt often be but little love lost between the\r\nHelvetians and the soldiery in occupation. Tacitus (\"Annals\") tells of\r\none bloody episode. After the death of the madman hero, the twenty-first\r\nlegion, surnamed _Rapax_, or Rapacious, no doubt for good reasons, was\r\nquartered at Vindonissa. Caecina, a violent man, lieutenant of Vitellius,\r\nthen commander of the Rhine army, marched into Helvetia to proclaim\r\nVitellius emperor. But the Helvetians supported his opponent Galba, not\r\nknowing that he had just been murdered, and fell upon the messengers of\r\nCaecina, and put them in prison, after first seizing their letters. The\r\nlieutenant enraged at this affront laid waste the neighbouring Aquae\r\n(Baden near Zurich), a flourishing watering-place much frequented for\r\nits amusements, Tacitus tells us. Calling in the Rhaetian cohorts, he\r\ndrove them to the Boetzberg, and cut them down by thousands in the\r\nwoods and fastnesses of Mount Jura; then, ravaging the country as he\r\nwent, Caecina marched on to Aventicum, which at once surrendered.\r\nAlpinus, a notable leader, was put to death, and the rest were left to\r\nthe clemency of Vitellius. However, the Roman soldiery demanded the\r\ndestruction of the nation, but Claudius Cossus, a Helvetian of great\r\neloquence, moving them to tears by his touching words, they changed\r\ntheir minds, and begged that the Helvetians might be set at liberty.\r\n\r\nHowever this military occupation was, after sixty years of duration,\r\ndrawing to a close. Under Domitian and Trajan all the land between\r\nStrasburg and Augsburg, as far as the Main, was conquered and annexed to\r\nthe Roman Empire. An artificial rampart was formed across country from\r\nthe mouth of the Main to Regensburg on the Danube, and the military\r\ncordon was removed from the Swiss frontier to the new boundary line.\r\nHelvetia, now no longer the rendezvous of the Roman legionaries, quietly\r\nsettled into a Roman province, where the language, customs, art, and\r\nlearning of Rome were soon to be adopted.\r\n\r\nIf the military stations were starting-points of the new culture, it was\r\nthe more peaceful immigrants who introduced agriculture, commerce, and\r\nwealth, or, at any rate, caused it to make progress. Gradually the\r\nHelvetians amalgamated with the Romans, adopting even their religion.\r\nHorticulture and vine-culture were introduced. A Roman farmer grew vines\r\non a patch of ground near Cully, on Lake Geneva, and on an inscribed\r\nstone (dug up at St. Prex) begs Bacchus (_Liber Pater Cocliensis_) to\r\nbless the vintage. He little anticipated that his plantation would be\r\nthe ancestor, as it were, of the famous La Cote, now so highly valued.\r\n\r\nWherever the art-loving Roman fixed his abode he built his house, with\r\nthe wonderful Roman masonry, and furnished it with all the luxury and\r\nart his refined taste suggested. Thus the country gradually assumed a\r\nRoman aspect. Many towns and _vici_, or village settlements, sprang up\r\nor increased in importance under Roman influence--Zurich, Aquae (Baden\r\nnear Zurich), Kloten, Vindonissa, and others.[10] Yet the eastern\r\nportion of the country could not compete in the matter of fine buildings\r\nwith the western cantons. Indeed, in the eastern districts the Helvetian\r\ninfluence was never predominated over by the Latin influence, and the\r\nHelvetians clung to their native speech despite the Latin tongue being\r\nthe official language.\r\n\r\nBut it was the mild and sunny west which most attracted the foreigner,\r\nas it still does. Wealthy Romans settled in great numbers between Mount\r\nJura and the Pennine ranges. Every nook and corner of the Canton Vaud\r\nbears even down to our days the stamp of Roman civilization. The shores\r\nand sunny slopes of Geneva lake were strewn with villas, and the woody\r\nstrip of land between Villeneuve and Lausanne and Geneva was almost as\r\nmuch in request for country seats by the great amongst the Romans as\r\nthat delightful stretch of coast on the Bay of Naples, from Posilippo\r\nto Pozzuoli and Baiae, where Cicero and Virgil, and many Romans of lesser\r\nmark, had their _villegiatures_.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable place, whether for art, learning, or opulence,\r\nwas Aventicum, the Helvetian capital. Of this town some mention has been\r\nmade above, and, did space permit, a full description might well be\r\ngiven of this truly magnificent and truly Roman city. Its theatre,\r\nacademy, senate-house, courts, palaces, baths, triumphal arches, and\r\nprivate buildings were wonderful. Am. Marcellinus, the Roman writer, who\r\nsaw Aventicum shortly after its partial destruction by the Alamanni,\r\ngreatly admired its palace's and temples, even in their semi-ruinous\r\ncondition. The city next in beauty and size was Augusta Rauracorum\r\n(Basel Augst), where the ruins of a vast amphitheatre still command our\r\nwondering admiration.\r\n\r\nBut this period of grandeur was followed by the gradual downfall of the\r\nempire, which was already rotten at the core. The degenerate Romans of\r\nthe later times were unable to stand against the attacks of the more\r\nvigorous Germans. The story is too long to tell in detail, but a few\r\npoints may be briefly noted. In 264 A.D. the Alamanni swept through the\r\ncountry on their way to Gaul, levelling Augusta Rauracorum with the\r\nground, and considerably injuring Aventicum. At the end of the third\r\ncentury the Romans relinquished their rampart between the Rhine and the\r\nDanube, and fell back upon the old military frontier of the first\r\ncentury. Helvetia thus underwent a second military occupation. Yet the\r\nprestige of Rome was gone. In 305 A.D. the Alamanni again overran\r\nHelvetia, and completed the ruin of Aventicum. Weaker and weaker grew\r\nthe Roman power, and when the Goths pressed into Italy the imperial\r\ntroops were entirely withdrawn from Helvetia. As for the Helvetians\r\nthemselves, they were quite unable to offer any resistance, and when the\r\nAlamanni once more burst into the land (406 A.D.), they were able to\r\nsecure entire possession of the eastern portions. The Burgundians,\r\nanother German tribe, followed suit, and in 443 A.D. fixed themselves in\r\nWest Helvetia. The inaccessible fastnesses of Graubuenden alone remained\r\nuntouched by the tide of German invasion, which effected such changes in\r\nthe neighbouring districts.\r\n\r\nAt this period of worldly grandeur and internal decay, occurs another\r\nhistorical event of the greatest importance, the rise of Christianity,\r\ncontaining the vital elements necessary for bringing about the spiritual\r\nregeneration of the world. The social and political decomposition\r\nthroughout the empire, the cruel tyranny of the sovereigns, the\r\ndecrepitude of the state and its institutions, the growing indifference\r\nto the national religion, which showed itself in the facile adoption of,\r\nor rather adaptation to, the Eastern forms of worship--the adoption of\r\nthe deities Isis and Mithra, for example--all these and many other\r\nthings unnecessary to mention, were unmistakable signs that Roman rule\r\nwas drawing to its close, and they also prepared the way for the\r\nreception of the new doctrine. The belief in one God of mercy and love;\r\nof one Saviour, the Redeemer of the world; of a future life,--were\r\nstartling but good tidings to the poor and oppressed, and made their\r\ninfluence felt also on the rich and cultivated, who saw in Christianity\r\na tolerance, benevolence, human love, loftiness of principle and moral\r\nperfection which had not been attained by the creeds of antiquity. The\r\npassionate ardour and force of conviction amongst the Christians was\r\nsuch that they faced suffering and death rather than abjure their tenets\r\nor desist from preaching them to others.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the introduction of Christianity into Switzerland are\r\nmostly legendary, yet it is generally believed that it was not the work\r\nof special missionaries. It is more likely that the new faith came to\r\nthe land as part and parcel of the Roman culture. Indeed this is now the\r\nopinion most generally received. The military operations of the empire\r\nrequired continual changes of locality on the part of the troops; thus\r\nwe find Egyptian, Numidian, and Spanish soldiers quartered on the Rhine\r\nand the Danube, and such as they would most probably be the first to\r\nbring in the new faith.\r\n\r\nAt first the Roman authorities looked upon Christians as state rebels,\r\nand fierce persecutions followed. The oldest Christian legend of this\r\ncountry tells of such a conflict between the state officials and the\r\nChristians, and no doubt contains some admixture of truth, as many of\r\nthese stories do. A legion levied at Thebes in Egypt--hence called the\r\n_Thebaide_--was sent to Cologne to take the place of troops required to\r\nquell a rising in Britain. Coming to the Valais, they were required by\r\nthe Emperor Maximian to sacrifice to the heathen gods (A.D. 280-300),\r\nbut being mostly Christians they refused, and were massacred with their\r\nchief, Mauritius. Some, however, escaped for the time, but were called\r\nupon to receive the martyr's crown later on, and in other places. Two\r\nsuch, Ursus and Victor, came to Soleure with sixty-six companions, and\r\nwere put to death by order of Hirtaeus, the Roman governor. Two others,\r\nFelix and his sister Regula, reached Zurich, where their successful\r\nconversions irritated Decius, who put them to the rack, and then\r\nbeheaded them. Yet, wonderful to tell, the legend goes on, they seized\r\ntheir heads that had fallen, and, walking with them to the top of a hill\r\nclose by, buried themselves, bodies and heads too. This wonderful feat\r\nwas an exact counterpart of that reported to have been performed also by\r\nUrsus and Victor at Soleure. Felix and Regula became the patron saints\r\nof Zurich, and play a conspicuous part in its local history. Tradition\r\nsays that Charlemagne himself in later days erected a minster on their\r\nburial spot. Thus, as ever, the blood of martyrs became the seed of the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOLD COIN OF SIXTEENTH CENTURY (ST. FELIX, ST.\r\nREGULA-SANCTUS CAROLUS). (_By Dr. Imhoof, Winterthur._)]\r\n\r\nThe Roman towns Geneva, St Maurice, Augusta Rauracorum, Aventicum,\r\nVindonissa, and Curia had been episcopal sees since the third century,\r\nthough some of these sees were in process of time removed to other\r\nplaces. Thus, Augusta, Vindonissa, and St. Maurice were removed to\r\nBasel, Constance, and Sion respectively.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] We know little of them, most likely they were but _vici_ (village\r\nsettlements). Aquae alone we know from Tacitus was a city-like\r\nwatering-place; Kloten had handsome villas, but what it was we do not\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nTHE ANCESTORS OF THE SWISS NATION.\r\n\r\n_THE ALAMANNI; BURGUNDIANS; FRANKS; MEROVINGIANS._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fifth century was remarkable for what may be called the dislocation\r\nof the peoples of Europe--the migrations of the Germans into the Roman\r\nEmpire, and, mightiest movement of all, the irruption of the Huns under\r\ntheir terrible king Attila, the \"Scourge of God.\" The mere sight of the\r\nhideous Asiatics filled men with horror. Never afoot, but ever on their\r\nill-shaped but rapid steeds, to whose backs they seemed as if they were\r\nglued, and on which they lived well-nigh day and night, it seemed as if\r\nman and horse had grown into one being. Their large heads ill-matched\r\ntheir meagre bodies; their tawny faces with deep-set eyes and high,\r\nprotruding cheek-bones made them resemble rough-cut figures in stone\r\nrather than human beings. The Goths regarded them as the offspring of\r\nspirits of the desert and of witches. These masses of Asiatic barbarism,\r\nwhich had burst into Europe, stayed for awhile in Hungary, but soon\r\nrolled towards the West, dislodging all the peoples with whom they came\r\nin contact. Marching to the Rhine, they drove the Burgundians from their\r\nsettlements in the district of Worms, a land so rich in song and saga,\r\nand entered Gaul to found a new kingdom. But the doom of the Huns was at\r\nhand, for Aetius the Roman general, and the last defender of the empire,\r\ndefeated them, A.D. 451, in a truly gigantic battle on the Catalaunian\r\nPlain, in the Champagne country. The slaughter was so terrible that the\r\nsaying went abroad that the river ran high with the blood of 300,000\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nBut it was clear that the tottering empire could not defend itself\r\nagainst a whole world in commotion. The time had come when Rome was to\r\nleave the stage of history. The great German nation was forming. It\r\nwould be tedious and profitless to mention all the German tribes beyond\r\nthe Rhine and Danube, a well-nigh endless list of names, impossible to\r\nremember. Besides, the petty tribes and clans gradually formed alliances\r\nwith each other for greater security, and, dropping their ancient names,\r\ntook collective ones more familiar to our ears--Saxons, Franks,\r\nThuringi, Burgundians, Alamanni, and Bavarians.\r\n\r\nOf these the Alamanni and the Burgundians are those from whom the Swiss\r\nare descended, and thus Switzerland, like England, has to look back to\r\nGermany as its ancestral home. The tall, fair-haired, true-hearted\r\nAlamanni for whom Caracalla had such an admiration that to be like them\r\nhe wore a red wig, are said to have been descendants of the Semnones,\r\nwho had migrated from Lusatia on the Spree (in Silesia) to the Main. The\r\nname Alamanni is generally held by the learned to be derived from\r\n_alah_, a temple-grove, and implies a combination of various tribes,\r\n\"the people of the Divine grove.\" The Suevi, of whom the Semnones were\r\nthe most conspicuous tribe, had a sacred grove in the district of the\r\nSpree, where they met for worship. In the fifth century we find the\r\nAlamanni occupying the district from the Main to the Black Forest, East\r\nHelvetia, and Alsatia as far as the Vosges.\r\n\r\nWhen this formidable horde took possession of Eastern Helvetia they\r\nfound but little trouble from the Celto-Roman population, who, thinned\r\nby previous invasions, and unaccustomed to fighting, could offer no\r\nserious resistance, and sank into slaves and servants. The towns were\r\nlaid in ruins, the country ravaged, and all culture trodden under foot.\r\nIt seemed as if \"the hand on the dial of history had been put back by\r\ncenturies,\"[11] and civilization had once more to begin her work. They\r\noutnumbered the natives, and were not absorbed by them, but on the\r\ncontrary on the half-decayed stock of the Roman province the Alamanni\r\nwere grafted as a true German people, retaining their old language,\r\ninstitutions, and mode of living.\r\n\r\nThe Alamanni did not at once develop into a civilized and cultivated\r\npeople, but retained their fondness for war and hunting, and other\r\ncharacteristics of their ancient life. Their grand and majestic woods\r\nhad stamped themselves on the intrepid, dauntless spirits, whose deep\r\nsubjectiveness and truthful natures contrasts strongly with the polished\r\nartfulness of the Romans. For the mighty aspects of nature--forest,\r\nmountain, sea--play their part in moulding the character of a nation.\r\nAnd their impenetrable woods had influenced the destinies of the Germans\r\nin the early periods of their history--had saved them from the Roman\r\nyoke, the labyrinths of swamp and river, defying even the forces of the\r\nwell-nigh all-powerful empire. Then, too, when hard fighting was afoot,\r\nand men had burnt their homesteads before the advance of the foe, the\r\nvast forest formed a safe retreat for women and children. The original\r\nhouse, by the way, was a mere wooden tent on four posts, and could be\r\ncarried off on carts that fitted underneath. The next stage was a hut in\r\nthe style of the Swiss mountain-shed, but it was still movable--was, in\r\nfact, a chattel the more to be taken along on their wanderings.[12]\r\n\r\nTheir mode of settling in their new country was curious enough, though\r\nthe early settlement of England was very similar in character. Disliking\r\nwalled towns of the Roman fashion, the Germans felt their freedom of\r\nmovement impeded and their minds oppressed by living within the\r\nprison-like fortifications of strong cities. But loving seclusion and\r\nindependence, nevertheless, they built extensive farmsteads, where each\r\nman was his own master. To the homestead were added fields, meadows, and\r\nan extensive farmyard; the whole hedged about so as to keep the owner\r\naloof from his neighbours. Each farmer pitched his tent wherever \"spring\r\nor mead, or sylvan wood tempted him,\" reports Tacitus. This liking for\r\nseclusion on the part of the Germans is well shown in the case of\r\nZurich, for at one time the canton had three thousand farm homesteads,\r\nas against a hundred hamlets and twelve villages.\r\n\r\nThe mode of partitioning the land shows democratic features. It was\r\ndivided amongst the community according to the size of families and\r\nherds of cattle, but one large plot was left for the common use. The\r\nlarge _Allmend_, or common, supplied wood for the community, and there,\r\ntoo, might feed every man's flocks and herds. The nobleman as such had\r\nno domains specially set apart for him, his position and privileges were\r\nhonorary. He might be chosen as a high officer of a district, or even a\r\nduke, or leader of the army, in time of war. Payment for such services\r\nwas unknown. Money was scarce, and indeed its use was mainly taught them\r\nby the Romans. Not only did flocks and herds form their chief wealth,\r\nbut were the standard of value, each article being estimated as worth so\r\nmuch in cattle.\r\n\r\nSociety was from the very first sharply and clearly divided into two\r\ngreat classes--the landowners and the bondsmen--the \"free and the\r\nunfree.\" The former class was again split into \"lesser men,\" \"middle\r\nmen,\" and \"first men,\" or Athelinge (Adelige), these last named being of\r\nnoble blood, and owners of most land and the greatest number of slaves\r\nand cattle. The \"unfree\" were either _Hoerige_ that belonged to the\r\nestate they tilled, and might be sold with it, or slaves who could call\r\nnothing their own, for whatever they saved fell to their lord at their\r\ndeath, if he so willed. A shire or large district was subdivided into\r\nhundreds. The whole of the free men met on some hallowed spot, under\r\nsome sacred tree, with their priests and leaders. Here, besides\r\nperforming religious exercises, they discussed war and peace, dispensed\r\njustice, chose their officers of state, and their leader if war was\r\nimminent. War and jurisdiction were the whole, or well-nigh the whole,\r\nof public life at that early stage. The popular assemblies, done away\r\nwith by the feudal system, revived later on in the form of the famous\r\n\"Landsgemeinde\" of the forest district, which are still in use in some\r\nof the cantons. Blood money, or _wergild_, was exacted from wrong-doers\r\nas in Saxon times in England. The tariff drawn up for bodily injuries\r\nreveals the mercenary and brawling temper of a semi-civilized people.\r\n\r\nAt the time they settled in Switzerland the Alamanni were heathens, and\r\nworshipped nature-deities--in groves, near springs, or mountains--the\r\nnames of some of which we still trace in the names of the days of the\r\nweek. Their religion, which was that common to all Germany, reveals the\r\nGerman mind--full of reverie, deep thoughtfulness, and wild romantic\r\nfancy that leads to a tragical issue. Like most heathen people the\r\nAlamanni clothed their gods in their own flesh and blood. Woden and his\r\nattendant deities, shield-maidens--Freyr and Freya, the king and queen\r\nof the elves--dwarfs, giants, spirits--all these are well known to us,\r\nand are indeed the charm of the fairy tales of our youth. The bright\r\nspirits, the _Asen_, war against the spirit of darkness, the giants, and\r\nlose ground, for they have broken the treaties made with them. The Asen\r\nare the benevolent powers of nature, spring sunshine, and fertilizing\r\nrain, and live in bright palaces, in Walhalla, and receive the dead; the\r\nevil spirits are the sterile rock, the icy winter, the raging sea, the\r\ndestructive fire. Thor destroys the rocks with his Hammer, pounding them\r\nto earth that man may grow corn. The giants scale the sky to defy the\r\ngods for assisting mankind, but Heimdallr stands watching on the\r\nrainbow-bridge that leads to Asgard--the garden of the _Asen_--and\r\nprevents their entrance. But the gods themselves are stained with guilt,\r\nand in a fight with the Giants before the gates of Walhalla, they\r\nutterly destroy each other. The columns of heaven and the rainbow-bridge\r\nbreak down, the universe is destroyed and the downfall of the gods is\r\ncomplete. But the heathen Germans could not bear the notion of entire\r\nannihilation, so in a sort of epilogue the great tragedy is followed by\r\nthe dawn of brighter and better times, the gods recover their former\r\ninnocence, when they used to play with golden dice without knowing the\r\nvalue of gold.[13] The _Goetterdaemmerung_, the Divine Dawn, has broken,\r\nand a new epoch has set in for gods and men. One of Wagner's musical\r\ndramas is, as is well known, founded on these myths. . To turn to the\r\nBurgundians. They became the neighbours of the Alamanni in Helvetia\r\nabout 443 A.D., after a severe defeat by the Huns. This great battle is\r\npictured with great power in the \"Nibelungenlied.\" The Burgundians play\r\na conspicuous part in that grand old epic. A wonderful blending it is of\r\nheroic myth, beautiful romance, and historic sagas attaching to the\r\ngreat heroes of the early Middle Ages--Theodoric the Great, Gunther of\r\nBurgundy, Attila, King of the Huns. If space permitted, the whole story\r\nmight well be told, but in this place let one feat be cited as an\r\nexample. Siegfried, the Dragon-slayer, a demigod, invulnerable, like\r\nAchilles, except in one place, and who could make himself invisible,\r\nwoos the sweet and lovely maid of Worms. As \"invisible champion,\" he\r\nassists her brother Gunther in his combat with the warlike Brunhilde,\r\nQueen of the North, whom Gunther wishes to obtain to wife. After years\r\nof happy married life the Queen of Worms fell to a quarrel with the\r\nQueen of Xanten on a question of precedence, and the gallant Siegfried\r\nfalls a victim to Brunhilde's hatred, and her intrigue with Hagen. To\r\navenge his death, the disconsolate widow marries the powerful Attila,\r\nand engages in a terrible battle with the Burgundians. In this battle\r\nshe and her own kindred were slain. Attila and Dietrich of Verona\r\n(Theodoric the Great) are saved, however.\r\n\r\nAetius gave to the Burgundians as a settlement Sabaudia (Savoy), on\r\ncondition that they should protect Gaul and Italy from the incursions of\r\nthe Alamanni. One-third of the lands and homesteads were made over to\r\nthem by the Romans, and later two-thirds were yielded. Gradually the\r\nBurgundians advanced in the interior of Helvetia, Vaud, Valais, and\r\nFribourg, and into Southern Gaul. They occupied indeed all the territory\r\nfrom the Vosges to the Alps and the Mediterranean. They lived on\r\nfriendly terms with the previous settlers, differing considerably in\r\ncharacter from the Alamanni. Less numerous, less vigorous, and more\r\npliant, they were unable to Germanize the West, as the Alamanni did the\r\nEast, yet were strong enough to infuse new vital force into the\r\nenervated Roman populations. A readily cultivable race the Burgundians\r\navailed themselves of the Roman civilization and advancement, and\r\ngradually blended with the previous settlers--chiefly of Latin\r\norigin--to form a new people. Thus through Roman influence and German\r\ngrafting--with two distinct German grafts--two nationalities sprang up\r\nin Switzerland, and we find, as in our own day, the Germans in the\r\nnorth-east, and the French in the south-west.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EIGER IN THE BERNESE OBERLAND.]\r\n\r\nThe Roman influence over the Burgundians was greatly increased by the\r\npolicy of King Gundobad (A.D. 500). He had visited Italy, and had been\r\ngreatly taken with Roman institutions. There is still extant a letter of\r\nhis in which he begs of Theodoric the Great a sun- or water-dial which\r\nhe had seen at his Court. Gundobad's code of laws was a blending of\r\nRoman legislation with German jurisdiction. He introduced the Latin\r\nspeech and chronology officially, and gave the Romans equal rights and\r\nan equal standing with the German population. Religious differences\r\narising--the Burgundians were Arians--and conflicts ensuing between king\r\nand people, the Franks took advantage of the turmoils to bring the\r\nsubjects of Gundobad under their sway.\r\n\r\nThere was no love lost between the Alamanni and their neighbours, the\r\nBurgundians; indeed the national antipathy for each other was great, but\r\nthe Frankish domination did more than anything else towards bringing\r\nabout a union between the hostile peoples. The reports they have left as\r\nto the character of the Franks are not flattering. They said that the\r\nFranks were capable of breaking an oath with a smiling face, and a\r\nsaying ran, \"Take a Frank for a friend, but never for a neighbour.\"\r\nClovis, the Frankish king, had waded to the throne through the blood of\r\nhis own kin. He was, however, the first to take more extended views in\r\npolitics, and planned a united German kingdom after the type of the\r\nRoman Empire. To his vast scheme the Alamanni fell the first victims. A\r\ngreat battle was fought in which they suffered defeat. Clovis had vowed\r\nthat he would embrace Christianity if he should prevail against the\r\nAlamannic Odin. Victory falling to his side, Clovis and his nobles were\r\nbaptized. His conversion was a great triumph for the Church, and\r\nfurnished the Merovingian kings with a pretext for the conquest of the\r\nArian Germans, who had been led astray from the orthodox faith. To crown\r\nthe work and enhance his greatness in the eyes of his Roman and German\r\nsubjects, the imperial purple, and the title of Roman Patricius was\r\nbestowed on Clovis by the Greek emperor.\r\n\r\nThe subjection of Burgundy was brought about in the following reign,\r\nunder Sigismund, who had been guilty of the murder of his son by the\r\ndesire of the stepmother. He fled to St. Maurice, which he endowed so\r\nrichly that it gave shelter to upwards of five hundred monks. However,\r\nhis piety did not bring him victory, for the Burgundians were defeated\r\nby the Franks at Autun in 532, and Sigismund and his family were hurled\r\ndown a well.\r\n\r\nIn the same year Chur-Rhaetia was yielded to the Franks by the Goths, who\r\nrequired their help against the East. Rhaetia, which had escaped the\r\nGerman invasion, had fallen to the share of the Goths of Italy, and had\r\nenjoyed the protection and munificence of their glorious king, Theodoric\r\nthe Great. He defended her against her neighbours as a forepost of\r\nItaly, but left intact the Roman institutions.\r\n\r\nThus had Helvetia been formed into a Frankish dependency; not a vestige\r\nwas left of the very name Helvetia. Yet the Frankish rule was more\r\nnominal than real. Counts were appointed to govern shires and hundreds,\r\nand, being royal governors, were elected by, and dependent on, the\r\nFrankish kings. Jurisdiction, military command, summoning to war,\r\nraising of taxes--fishing, hunting, coinage, had become royal\r\nprerogatives--and the farmers kicked against the impositions--these were\r\nthe functions of the governing counts. None the less the Burgundians\r\nretained their king or patricius, and the Alamanni remained under the\r\nsway of their own duke, to whom alone they gave allegiance. Chur-Rhaetia\r\nwas particularly privileged. It was ruled by a royal governor, who was\r\nsupreme judge, count, and _praeses_, and the dignity remained for one\r\nhundred and fifty years in one powerful and wealthy native family called\r\nthe Victoriden, who held likewise the ecclesiastical livings. On its\r\nextinction in 766, Bishop Tello, the last of the family, bestowed the\r\nimmense wealth on the religious-houses of Disentis and Chur.\r\n\r\nThe promotion of Christianity, and the staunch support given by the\r\nMerovingian kings to the Church, were perhaps the greatest benefits\r\nresulting from the Frankish rule. Knowing the Church to be the sole\r\nmeans by which in that benighted age culture could be spread and\r\ncivilization extended, those monarchs availed themselves of her\r\nservices, and bestowed upon her in return great wealth and high\r\nprerogatives. Churches and religious-houses sprang up one could hardly\r\ntell how. In French Switzerland there were founded the bishoprics of\r\nGeneva, Lausanne, and Sion; and in the eastern half of the country those\r\nof Basel, Vindonissa (removed to Constance in the sixth century), and\r\nChur. St. Maurice, benefited, as we have seen, by Sigismund, was a\r\nflourishing abbey town. Yet many of the Alamanni held tenaciously to\r\ntheir old gods, and their holy shrines and idols stood side by side with\r\nthe Cross; even Christians invoked Woden, for fear he should be offended\r\nby their neglect.\r\n\r\nThe further amalgamation of heathenism and Christianity was most\r\neffectually stopped by--curious to say--a caravan of Irish monks. In\r\nfact, later tradition attributed to these monks the foundation of\r\nreligious-houses, to a number which modern investigation has shown to\r\nhave been greatly exaggerated. Ireland, which had so far escaped the\r\nstruggle with the great Teutonic race, had given all her energies to the\r\npromotion of the new faith, and ever since the fourth century\r\nChristianity had wonderfully flourished in the island. Filled with\r\nmissionary ardour, the Irish Columban conceived an intense desire to\r\nconquer Gaul and Germany, and in 610 set out on his wanderings with a\r\nstaff of twelve companions. Equipped with \"knotty sticks,\" a leather\r\nvial, a travelling pouch, a relic case, and with a spare pair of boots\r\nhung round the neck, \"tatooed,\" wearing long waving hair,[14] the\r\nadventurous band arrived in Gaul, and founded monasteries in the Vosges\r\ndistrict. However, they offended Queen Brunhilde by their frankness, and\r\nhad to depart. Proceeding to Eastern Helvetia, they arrived at Zurich,\r\nbut at length finding nothing more to do there, as we may suppose, they\r\nproceeded to Tuggen, on the Upper Zurich lake. Here they saw people\r\nengaged in an oblation of beer to the national gods. Moved with holy\r\nanger, the monks upset the vessel, and flung the idols into the lake,\r\nand won many to Christianity. We cannot here follow them in their\r\ndevoted labours. Columban passed on into Italy, but left his disciple\r\nGallus in the neighbourhood of Lake Constance. Hence sprang up the\r\nfamous monastery bearing his name.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] Green's \"Smaller History of England,\" p. 42.\r\n\r\n[12] Dahn, \"Urgeschichte der Roemanish-germanischen Voelker.\"\r\n\r\n[13] Dahn\r\n\r\n[14] Professor Rahn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nTHE CAROLINGIANS--CHARLEMAGNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the last Merovingian kings, whose character is sufficiently\r\nattested by the name of _Faineants_--sluggards--Alamannia and Burgundy\r\nstruggled to shake off the Frankish yoke. Now the wealth and power of\r\nthose weak kings were passing from them to their \"Mayors of the Palace.\"\r\nCharles Martel, one of these \"Mayors,\" defeated the Alamanni in a great\r\nbattle (A.D. 730), and Carlomann, Charlemagne's brother, had a number of\r\nAlamannic grandees put to the sword, and their lands confiscated (A.D.\r\n746).\r\n\r\nCharles Martel remained simple \"Mayor of the Palace,\" but Pepin le Bref\r\nhad himself crowned king, at St. Denis, by Stephen II., in 751,\r\nrewarding the Pope for this great service by the gift of a tract of land\r\naround the Holy City. By this _coup d'etat_ were established both the\r\nCarolingian dynasty and the temporal power of the Pope--well-nigh\r\nconvertible terms. The new dynasty greatly fostered religion, and\r\nfurthered the work begun by the Irish and Anglo-Saxon monks. St. Gall's\r\ncell became an abbey church and monastic school; St. Leodegar's at\r\nLucerne was incorporated with the abbey of Murbach in Alsatia; and on\r\nthe bank of the Limmat at Zurich arose a college of prebends.\r\n\r\nPepin le Bref was succeeded by his son, Charles the Great, or\r\nCharlemagne, as he is usually called (768-814). For nearly half a\r\ncentury this talented, powerful, and lofty-minded sovereign swayed the\r\ndestinies of Europe with unflagging zeal, ever bearing in mind the\r\nresponsibilities of his exalted position. He ruled over a vast domain,\r\nstretching from the Ebro in Spain to the Theiss in Hungary, and from\r\nDenmark to the Tiber. Saxons, Sclavonians, Avars, Lombards, and Arabs,\r\nwere subject to his rule. His Court was a great intellectual centre,\r\nwhence enlightenment spread to every part of his dominions. Charlemagne\r\nwas great as a general, as a statesman, as a politician; he was a\r\npainstaking economist, and his humanity, and his other virtues secured\r\nfor him the noble title of \"Father of Europe.\" A brilliant figure in a\r\nbenighted age, which shed its light on after times. No wonder mediaeval\r\nfancy lingered fondly on his memory; and around his name gathered song\r\nand saga and legend. Charlemagne is a special favourite with the Swiss;\r\nindeed, of all the German rulers who have held sway over them, he is the\r\none whose memory is most dear; and Switzerland has done at least her\r\nshare in helping to swell the mass of legend and fiction respecting him.\r\nThe impulse he gave to education in this country was alone sufficient to\r\nendear his memory to the Swiss. Basel, Geneva, Chur, and Sion, benefited\r\nby his wise administration, and Zurich quite particularly exalts him,\r\ncalling him the \"Fountain of her intellectual life,\" during the Middle\r\nAges. It is impossible as it is unnecessary to give at length in this\r\nvolume, the history of this long and brilliant reign. A few points may\r\nsuffice to indicate the character of Charlemagne, and to throw some\r\nlight on the times, and the condition of the country.\r\n\r\nThe ambition of the Franks to found an empire after the fashion of Rome\r\nwas practically realized when Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of the\r\nWest by Hadrian in A.D. 800. Yet Charles aimed less at mere outward\r\ngrandeur than at the establishment of a spiritual kingdom on earth, and\r\na kingdom that should embrace all his people in one Christian Church,\r\nupheld by a strong and well-organized state-commonwealth. The union of\r\nChurch and State, yet giving the preponderance to the latter, was\r\nCharlemagne's leading idea, and well-nigh summed up his religious and\r\npolitical creed. The strong religious bent of this \"priestly king\" was\r\nrevealed at the very beginning of his reign, when he took upon himself\r\nthe mission of \"Defender of the Holy Church, and _Coadjutor of the\r\nApostolic See_\"[15] thus claiming, with the concurrence of the Primate,\r\nthe spiritual guidance of his realm. Hadrian's congenial nature and\r\ntendencies helped to bring about this union. Yet in this matter Charles\r\nbut conformed to the policy of his ancestors, and to the spirit of the\r\nage, an age remarkable for acts of piety and devotion. And the history\r\nof Switzerland is for that period rather a history of the religious\r\nmovements of the time than a political chronicle. For in those early\r\nstages the Church was proportionally far more important than in our own\r\ntimes. _Then_ she was the sole, or almost the sole, centre of intellect,\r\nof art, of letters, and represented the ideal side of life in an\r\nilliterate age. Despite her defects the Church was a blessing to\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nHelvetian lands had entirely lost their political independence. During\r\nthis reign, the vigorous government of the monarch frustrated every\r\nattempt at insurrection, and in the end both Alamanni and Burgundians\r\nbegan to feel the benefits arising from the existence of a wise and firm\r\nadministration. To curb their power the sovereign abolished the\r\ndignities of the mighty dukes, and parcelled out the land into smaller\r\nshires (than the old county divisions), and placed over these counts as\r\nroyal governors with judicial power. The people no longer appeared _in\r\ncorpore_ at the shire-motes, but were represented at the lesser court by\r\n_Schoeffen_, or reeves. These reeves had to bring in the verdict; if\r\nthey could not agree, trial-by-ordeal was resorted to. Twice a year\r\nCharles assembled his nobles and bishops to receive their reports, and\r\nto frame laws, which were, however, submitted to the people, that is,\r\nthe \"freeholders\" at the \"real thing,\" when they met in May. For the\r\ncontrol of the shire administration, and to give the people a means of\r\nappealing more directly to the king's justice, he appointed a special\r\ncommission of spiritual and temporal officers (_missi dominici_).\r\n\r\nCharlemagne's legislation, it hardly needs to be said, was highly\r\nfavourable to the Church, and tended to increase her wealth largely. He\r\nallotted to her tithes of the produce of the soil, and the people of\r\ntheir own free will overwhelmed the ecclesiastical and monastic\r\ninstitutions with offerings of lands and money. In the eighth century\r\nthe monastery of St. Gall already possessed 160,000 acres of land, which\r\nhad been bestowed by pious donors, whilst the twelve hundred\r\ndeeds-of-gift found amongst the old abbey documents testify to the zeal\r\nof the givers. Religious establishments became the largest landowners in\r\nthe country, and vassalage and the feudal system sprang up.\r\n\r\nUnder the territorial subdivision Switzerland fell into the shires of\r\nThurgau, Aargau, Genevagau, Waldgau (Vaud), &c., far larger than at\r\npresent, whence are derived the names of various cantons as we have them\r\nnow. Some of the Swiss would seem to have shared in Charlemagne's\r\nmilitary glory. The \"Monk of St. Gall,\"[16] recently identified with\r\nNotker Balbulus (the Stammerer), the popular biographer of Charlemagne,\r\ntells in bombastic style the feats of an Alamannic hero from Thurgau.\r\nThis mediaeval Hercules--Eishere the Giant by name--had accompanied the\r\nemperor against the Avars, and after his return, reported that they had\r\n\"mowed down the enemy like grass,\" and that he himself had \"strung on\r\nhis lance some six or eight pigmy toads of Bohemians as if they were\r\nlarks, then carried them hither and thither, not knowing what they were\r\ngrumbling out\"! Notker, the chronicler, had in his youth heard the story\r\nof the military exploits of Charlemagne, from an old Thurgau soldier who\r\nhad followed the emperor in his wars. And when Charles III. was on a\r\nvisit to St. Gall in 883, he was so delighted with the monk's lively\r\nchat about the matchless emperor, that he requested him to write down\r\nhis recollections of his illustrious ancestor. To this monkish\r\nchronicler we owe so many of the pleasant stories of Charlemagne current\r\namong us.[17]\r\n\r\nInteresting and touching are the traits we constantly meet with in the\r\nglimpses we get of the Court and private life of the emperor. His\r\ndaughters were not allowed to marry because he could not bear separation\r\nfrom them. Hatto of Basel, the most illustrious of his elder bishops,\r\noften inveighed against the monarch's weaknesses, yet Charlemagne not\r\nonly bore the bishop's censures, but sent him on a highly honourable\r\nmission to the Court of Constantinople, and chose him as one of the\r\nwitnesses to his last will. The emperor's friendship with Pope Hadrian\r\nwas quite remarkable, and, in spite of many differences, was deep and\r\nlasting. On hearing the news of Hadrian's death, Charlemagne burst into\r\ntears, and eulogized him in the most flattering terms. The emperor's\r\nmanagement of his royal estates was in the highest degree prudent,\r\nskilful, energetic, and in every way admirable. To his property he gave\r\nthe closest and most constant inspection, down to the very eggs\r\nproduced on his farms.\r\n\r\nHe gathered round him scholars, artists, and teachers, from Italy and\r\nGreece, and a Court school was opened by Alcuin, the Anglo-Saxon\r\nscholar--the English were then the most cultured of the German\r\npeoples--and a body of English pupils followed him to France. Alcuin\r\nbecame the friend, and in matters educational the counsellor, of\r\nCharlemagne, by whom he was entrusted with the revision of the Bible.\r\nWarnfried Paulus Diaconus, the famous Lombard writer, was ordered to\r\ncompile a collection of homilies from the Fathers. Copies of both these\r\nremarkable manuscripts--Bible and Homilies--were presented to the church\r\nof Zurich, and one, the beautiful Alcuin Bible, is still extant and\r\namong its literary treasures. Thronging the learned circle whose poetic\r\ncentre was Charles himself, with his wife and daughters, and two\r\nsisters, were Einhard the German, the confidant and biographer of the\r\nemperor; Augilhard, the knightly poet; the Goth Theobald, Bishop of\r\nOrleans, a scholar and man of the world; as well as many another\r\nillustrious man. Charlemagne's two sisters were nuns, and one of them,\r\nGisela, was the great friend of Alcuin.[18]\r\n\r\nCharlemagne was fond of visiting and occasionally teaching in his Court\r\nschool. He took great interest in the progress of his scholars, praising\r\nthe diligent and admonishing the indolent. The \"Monk\" informs us that on\r\none occasion finding the compositions of the poorer boys praiseworthy,\r\nwhilst those of the young nobles were unsatisfactory, the emperor rose\r\nup in anger and warned these latter youths that their high birth and\r\nfine manners should not screen them from punishment if they did not get\r\nrid of their laziness. Then, turning to the poor but meritorious youths,\r\nhe highly commended them, and exhorted them to be always thus diligent,\r\npromising them rewards and preferment if they continued in their good\r\ncourse. Charlemagne indeed gained imperishable glory by his educational\r\nefforts, through which a foundation was laid for after ages. Full of the\r\nconviction that religion and learning were essential to happiness, he\r\nyearned to spread education amongst his people, and made it the chief\r\nobject of his later years. All parents ought, he says, \"to send their\r\nboys to school, and let them abide there till they are well informed,\" a\r\nprinciple only imperfectly understood and acted upon even in our own\r\nday. This ideal side of his complex activity lifts him far above the\r\nother rulers of the Middle Ages. To our mind there is but one who bears\r\ncomparison with him for greatness of character and lofty aims--Alfred\r\nthe Great, of Wessex. Clerical colleges, and secular schools attached to\r\nthem, sprang up all over the country, and the knowledge of the\r\nScriptures, hitherto confined to the clergy, was freely placed before\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nThe bishops were charged by the emperor to take care that the priests\r\nwere \"well qualified as religious teachers.\" Theobald enjoins his clergy\r\nto open schools and \"teach the children with love, and to accept no fees\r\nbut what the parents choose to give.\" Such was the emperor's\r\neducational zeal, that he ordains whipping and deprivation of food even\r\nfor men and women if they do not know by heart the Confession of Faith\r\nand the Lord's Prayer, and are not able to repeat them in Latin to the\r\npriests. Yet he makes allowances for the dunces who are permitted to\r\nlearn and repeat these exercises in their own illiterate language. He\r\nadmonishes the monks to learn better grammar, and get rid of their\r\nuncouth modes of speech. He strongly reprimands a choirboy whose wrong\r\nnotes grate on his delicate ear.\r\n\r\nAmongst the bishops of Switzerland, Hatto of Basel, and Remedius of\r\nChur-Rhaetia, were Charlemagne's chief supporters and lawgivers in their\r\nown dioceses. The latter prelate was a great friend of Alcuin, and held\r\na brilliant Court with many vassals. The power of these theocratic\r\ngovernors was very great. It may be mentioned, as an example of this,\r\nthat Remedius decreed that persons guilty of sacrilege should be covered\r\nwith hot tar and made to ride thus on a donkey through the villages. The\r\nemperor's protection to church and school foundations was exercised in\r\nmany cases in Switzerland. According to tradition, Sion was enriched\r\nwith landed property; and to St. Maurice was presented a fine onyx cup\r\nadorned with beautiful Greek _relievi_, still amongst the treasures of\r\nthat church. Zurich attributes her oldest churches and schools to the\r\nemperor's bounty. To him she is said to owe her minster, bearing his\r\nname and statue; the Chorherrenstift, or College of Canons, and the\r\nCarolinum, a clerical school for prebends or canons, which developed in\r\n1832 into the University and Gymnasium respectively, and finally the\r\nWasserkirche, a chapel by the riverside, on the spot where the martyrs\r\nFelix and Regula once suffered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT MINSTER AND WASSERKIRCHE, ZURICH.\r\n\r\n(_Appenzeller, Zurich._)]\r\n\r\nZurich was indeed, according to tradition, a favourite residence of the\r\ngreat monarch, and his mansion is said to have been the Haus zum Loch\r\n(hole or cavern), standing on a steep incline near the minster.\r\nConnected with this is a charming legend which reflects the character\r\nfor justice he had gained amongst the people. This story may also serve\r\nas an example, the only one our space will permit us to give, of the\r\nabundant store of legend collected around the memory of Charlemagne.\r\nThere was a chapel on the riverside where he had placed a bell for\r\npeople to ring if they wished to appeal to justice. One day as he was at\r\ndinner with his queen this bell began to ring. None of the servants\r\ncould inform him what was the matter. The bell rang a second time, and\r\nthen a third. On this the emperor rose from the table, saying, \"I am\r\nsure there is some poor man you don't wish me to see.\" So saying, he\r\nwalked down the hill to the chapel, where, hanging to the bell rope, he\r\nfound a large snake. The reptile crept down, moved towards him, and\r\nwagged her tail to pay her respects. Then going on in front she led\r\nCharlemagne to a tuft of nettles, and his servants examining the spot\r\nfound a large toad sitting on the eggs in the serpent's nest. At once,\r\ngrasping the meaning of this appeal, he sat him down in his chair of\r\njustice and passed sentence that the toad should be killed and\r\nquartered. The next day at dinner time the snake appeared in the\r\npassage, frightening the attendants grievously. However, Charles quieted\r\nthem, and said, \"God is wonderful, and we cannot know the meaning of\r\nthis.\" The snake entered the hall, climbed on the table, and, beckoning\r\nthe emperor to remove the lid of his golden goblet, dropped into it a\r\nbeautiful jewel. Then, descending from the table, she bowed to the royal\r\ncouple, and disappeared. Charles held this to be a good omen, and\r\nresolved never to part with the jewel. The moral is obvious. Charlemagne\r\nwas so just, and his reputation for equity so widespread, that even the\r\nlower animals appealed to him, and not in vain.\r\n\r\nAccording to another version, the stone exerted attraction like a\r\nloadstone, for where it was dropped the emperor could not leave the\r\nplace. But Archbishop Turpin had dropped it into the springs of Aachen,\r\nand hence Charlemagne no more quitted that royal residence.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible in our space, even if it were interesting to the\r\ngeneral reader, to enter into the discussions respecting Charlemagne's\r\nfoundations in and visits to Zurich. Two things, however, come out\r\nclearly; first (thanks to the labours of the learned historian,\r\nProfessor Georg von Wyss), that tradition is not entirely unworthy of\r\ntrust, as there is documentary evidence still extant to prove that\r\nCharlemagne reformed the College (Chorherrenstift); second, that he kept\r\nup a close connection with the city, whether he actually resided there\r\nor not.\r\n\r\nNo doubt this exaltation of Charlemagne's merits is an expression of the\r\nattachment felt for his person, and of the admiration for his\r\nmarvellous educational efforts. His grandson, Louis the German, founded\r\nthe Abbey of our Lady, in 853, on the site of an old convent erected to\r\nthe memory of the patron saints of Zurich. Louis erected this new abbey\r\nin order to give a more brilliant church preferment to his daughter,\r\nHildgard, Lady Principal of a small convent at Wurzburg. This Princess\r\nAbbess received the sole right of jurisdiction, and the convent rose\r\nrapidly, and with it extended the city commonwealth. (We shall show in a\r\nlater chapter how this female government checked the growth of political\r\npower in that city, and yet was the making of her.)\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] See Buedinger, \"Von den Anfangen des Schulzwanges,\" Zurich, 1865, p.\r\n10.\r\n\r\n[16] Professor Baechtold, \"History of German Literature in Switzerland,\"\r\nFrauenfeld, 1887.\r\n\r\n[17] Professor Baechtold, \"History of German Literature in Switzerland,\"\r\nFrauenfeld, 1887.\r\n\r\n[18] See Gustav Freytag's charming \"Pictures of the Middle Ages.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nTHE KINGDOM OF BURGUNDY; THE DUCHY OF SWABIA; AND THE GERMAN EMPIRE.\r\n\r\n(843-1100.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of the great emperor brought this realm into utter confusion,\r\nthe whole fabric of his wise and firm administration falling to pieces.\r\nAll the heterogeneous and often refractory elements which his stern rule\r\nhad kept in check burst their bounds and gained full play during the\r\nreigns of his descendants, who grew weaker and weaker, though with here\r\nand there an exception. The pretensions of the Church, which\r\nCharlemagne's own protection and fostering care had, so to speak,\r\nushered in and strengthened; the struggles of eminent families and\r\ndynastic houses for sovereignty in the absence of one central and\r\nundisputed power; the increase of the immunities and the growth of\r\nfeudalism--all these were serious difficulties for the coming rulers to\r\ncope with.\r\n\r\nLouis the Pious, the only surviving son of Charlemagne, and heir to his\r\ncrown, was clearly quite unfit to cope with these difficulties\r\nsatisfactorily. The untimely distribution of the crown lands insisted on\r\nby the imperious Judith, his second wife, in favour of her own son, and\r\nthe protracted struggles between the imperial princes, steeped the realm\r\nin intestine wars, and in the end led to its dissolution. It is\r\nimpossible in this short sketch to follow to his tragical end this\r\nunworthy son of a great father. The treaty of Verdun (843) settled the\r\nbloody conflicts, but split the empire into three new dominions; the\r\nEast Frankish realm devolving on Louis the German: the West Frankish\r\nkingdom falling to Charles the Bald; and the middle district, including\r\nItaly and the strip of land between the two first divisions just\r\nmentioned, and comprising Provence, Burgundy, Lorraine, and the\r\nNetherlands. This last realm fell to Lothair.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Verdun, to which the French and German States trace their\r\norigin, also effected the most sweeping changes in Helvetia, and altered\r\ngreatly its political aspect. The country was rent into two halves, East\r\nSwitzerland, forming the Aare, with Chur-Rhaetia, being incorporated with\r\nthe East Frankish kingdom; and West Helvetia and the Valais with\r\nLorraine or the middle kingdom. This naturally tended to revive the\r\nnational antagonism between the two Helvetias.\r\n\r\nFreed from the iron hand which had crushed all attempts at insurrection,\r\nthe peoples began again their struggles for the recovery of national\r\nindependence and separate rule, and thence came the restoration of the\r\nkingdom of Burgundy and the Duchy of Alamannia, or Swabia.[19] Burgundy\r\nwas the first to make sure of her national freedom. On the death of\r\nLothair in 855 his kingdom fell to pieces. Count Boso, of Vienna, his\r\nrelative, founded the kingdom of Burgundy _without_ Helvetia, 879\r\n(Provence or Arles--_Arelatisches Reich_). After fruitless attempts by\r\nvarious Burgundian nobles to establish their sovereignty _within_\r\nHelvetia, a renowned nobleman, Rudolf, of the illustrious house of the\r\nGuelfs, set up as a pretender to Swiss Burgundy, after the precedent of\r\nCount Boso. Rudolf possessed vast estates in Swabia, on Lake Constance.\r\nHe had sworn allegiance to Charles III. (the \"Stout\"), who, weak as he\r\nwas, had, strange to say, once more united the Empire under his sceptre.\r\nOn his death, in 888, Rudolf the Guelf was crowned king at St. Maurice,\r\nthe venerable abbey-town in the Low-Valais, by a large assembly of\r\nBurgundian bishops and nobles. Thus was established the Helvetian\r\nkingdom of Upper or New Burgundy (_Burgundia transjurans_), which seems\r\nto have extended into Lorraine and Savoy. In 933 both Burgundies were\r\nunited.\r\n\r\nRudolf not only maintained his independence against the aggressive\r\nspirit of intruding neighbours, but carried his victories into East\r\nHelvetia, as far as Lake Zurich, and on his death in 912 his crown\r\npassed without opposition to his son Rudolf II. This king had inherited\r\nhis father's great abilities and restless habits, which engaged him in\r\nnumerous wars. His greatest martial achievement was the defeat of the\r\nHungarians, who were making their fearful inroads into Europe. In East\r\nHelvetia, however, his advance was checked by Burkhard I., Duke of\r\nAlamannia, who routed him at Winterthur, near Zurich, in 919. Led no\r\ndoubt by their mutual admiration for each other's prowess, and by common\r\npolitical interests, they made peace and contracted a lasting\r\nfriendship. To seal the union between the two Helvetias, Burkhard gave\r\nhis lovely daughter, Bertha, in marriage to the Burgundian king, and\r\ngave her as dowry the land between the Aare and the Reuss, the district\r\nfor which he had been contending. He even followed Rudolf on his\r\nexpedition to Italy, and fell in a skirmish whilst succouring his\r\nson-in-law. But Rudolf was unable to maintain the authority of his\r\nItalian crown, and exchanged his claim to Lombardy for the kingdom of\r\nLower Burgundy (Provence) in 933; this arrangement was, however, much\r\ncontested.\r\n\r\nWhen not engaged in wars he assisted his queen in her good works. The\r\nBurgundian kings as yet had no fixed residence, and moved from place to\r\nplace on their royal estates--to Lausanne, Payerne, Yverdon, Solothurn,\r\nor Lake Thun. When making these rounds Rudolf loved to do as the judges\r\nof Israel of old--to seat himself under the shade of a fine oak and deal\r\nout justice to whoever might come near and appeal to him. Yet the memory\r\nof this good king is almost eclipsed by the glory of his wife, the\r\nfamous \"Spinning Queen,\" and her wisdom and ministry amongst the poor.\r\n\r\nThings went less pleasantly with the Alamanni. Their efforts to restore\r\nseparate or self-government--the passionate yearning for national\r\nindependence innate in the German tribes has done much to bring about\r\nthe division of the German Empire into its many kingdoms,\r\nprincipalities, and duchies--met with far steadier and more violent\r\nopposition than was the case with the Burgundians.\r\n\r\nUnder the pacific rule of Louis the German (843-876) the Alamanni\r\nenjoyed the benefits of his peaceful tendencies, and we hear of no\r\nattempts at insurrection. This sensible and practical monarch left to\r\nEast Helvetia the \"remembrance of him in good works.\" Two things brought\r\nhim into close relations with this country--his founding of the Abbey of\r\nour Lady at Zurich, where he installed his daughters Hildegard and\r\nBertha, as has been stated before; and his benefactions to St. Gall,\r\nwhich he freed from the overlordship of Constance. Indeed, the\r\nchronicler of this latter institution, Notker, _Monachus S. Gallensis_,\r\nwould seem to have been fascinated by his personal charms and affable\r\nmanners. Promoted to the position of an independent abbey, owing\r\nallegiance to none but the king himself, and enriched by continual\r\ngrants of land on the part of pious donors, St. Gall developed into a\r\nflourishing monastic commonwealth. The peaceful colony of thrifty and\r\nstudious monks--Benedictines they were--who, like their Irish founder,\r\ncombined manual labour with learned contemplation, earnest study, and\r\nliterary skill--form a society quite unique in its way. The holy men\r\n\"conjure into their cells the departed spirits of classical\r\nantiquity,\"[20] and hold free intercourse with them; given to\r\necclesiastical learning, whilst not neglectful of profane studies, these\r\nlearned and high-bred scholars constitute a truly mediaeval university.\r\nTheir life and character is vividly set before us by their chroniclers.\r\n\r\nArnulf of Kaernthen (887-899), grandson of Louis, kept up a close\r\nconnection with St. Gall, through his chaplain, Solomon III., its abbot.\r\nHe governed the East Frankish kingdom with firmness and great ability.\r\nThe military glory of the Carolingians seemed to be restored when he\r\ndefeated the Normans brilliantly at Loewen on the river Dyle.\r\nUnfortunately this vigorous ruler died after a short reign, leaving his\r\ncrown to his only son, Louis \"the Child,\" then only six years of age.\r\nThrough the reign of this sickly prince (900-911) the country was torn\r\nby party struggles, and the invasions of the Hungarians increased the\r\ndistresses of the time. Contemporary writers seem hardly able to express\r\nthe horror they felt at the very sight of the Asiatics, who appeared\r\neven loathsome to them. Arnulf was reproached with having launched them\r\nupon Europe when he led them against his enemies, the Maehren; whilst\r\nCharlemagne's policy had been altogether opposed to this, he having shut\r\nthem in by raising gigantic walls on the Danube against the Avars. These\r\nwere followers of the Huns of the fifth century, and resembled them by\r\ntheir savage warfare and indescribable habits.\r\n\r\n\"Woe to the realm whose king is a child,\" writes Solomon III. to a\r\nbefriended bishop; \"all are at variance, count and vassals, shire and\r\nboundary neighbours; the towns rise in rebellion, the laws are trampled\r\nunder foot, and we are at the mercy of the savage hordes.\" Such was the\r\ncondition of the country at the opening of the tenth century. Solomon,\r\nwho wrote these lamentations, was himself a powerful political ruler no\r\nless than a Church potentate. Next to Archbishop Hatto, of Mayence, who\r\ngoverned during the minority of Louis, Solomon was the most influential\r\nman at the German Court, and wielded its destinies after Hatto's death.\r\nThis high-born Churchman, educated as a secular priest at St. Gall,\r\nbecame secretary, chaplain, and chancellor, at the German Court, and\r\nenjoyed the friendship of four successive monarchs. Promoted by Arnulf\r\nto the Abbey of St. Gall in 890, and shortly afterwards to the see of\r\nConstance, he thus combined the dignities of the two rival institutions.\r\nSubtle, versatile, and indefatigable, this high ecclesiastic was the\r\nmost consummate courtier and man of the world. Handsome and magnificent,\r\nhe captivated his hearers in the council by the clearness of his\r\nargument and his ready wit; and melted the people to tears by his\r\neloquence in the pulpit. His leadership at St. Gall promoted the\r\nmagnificence of the abbey, and formed it into a prominent literary and\r\npolitical centre. It was, however, robbed of its ascetic character,\r\nSolomon being wanting in genuine piety, for one thing.\r\n\r\nThe absolute rule of this powerful prelate greatly checked the national\r\nrisings of the Swabian leaders, for he strenuously maintained the\r\noneness of Church and State. Conrad I. (911-919), the last of the East\r\nFrankish kings, gave all his energies to the one aim of strengthening\r\nand solidifying his rule by the suppression or abolition of the\r\ndukedoms, which he saw undermined the power of the sovereign. Relying on\r\nthe support of the clergy, he was strongly influenced by Solomon's\r\ninsinuations when he put forth his bloody measures against the Swabian\r\npretenders.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Louis the Child the state of anarchy had begotten\r\nnumerous national risings, which led to the establishment of the\r\nBavarian, Frankish, and Saxon duchies. At its very close a similar\r\nattempt was ventured upon in Alamannia. Burkhard, Marquis of\r\nChur-Rhaetia, afterwards Graubuenden, one of the most eminent of the\r\nSwabian grandees, put forward claims to the duchy. His sons were\r\nbanished, and, it was whispered, by Solomon's machinations (911). Yet\r\nall this was no check on the aspirations of the two brothers, Erchanger\r\nand Bertold, brothers-in-law to the king, who aspired to the Duchy of\r\nSwabia. They, too, fell victims to the policy of the prelate, whose\r\nhatred was intensified when they laid hands on his person to arrest him.\r\nConrad called a Synod to assist him, and heavy punishment was awarded\r\nthe pretenders. However, the king had them beheaded, no doubt to please\r\nhis chancellor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FURKA PASS.]\r\n\r\nThe cruel fate of the two made a deep impression on the people. Next\r\nyear, when Burkhard, son of the unfortunate marquis, returned to his\r\ncountry whence he had fled--for he had joined in the rising of the two\r\nbrothers, and had been summoned before the Synod--he was unanimously\r\nelected by the nobility and people (917). It was no small mortification\r\nto both king and bishop to have their designs thus thwarted, the\r\nprinciple they had so vigorously opposed being carried out. The annals\r\nof St. Gall bear witness to the fact that Solomon was implicated in the\r\nmurders, for though usually exalting his merits, they report that the\r\nmighty prelate repented of his cruel actions, since he wandered as a\r\npilgrim to Rome, contrite, weeping and lamenting, to do penance for his\r\nsins.\r\n\r\nConrad I., at the close of his reign, acknowledged that his policy had\r\nbeen a mistaken one by giving the crown to his most powerful antagonist,\r\nthe Saxon leader, Duke Henry, whose power he had striven to abrogate.\r\nHenry I., called \"the Fowler\" and the \"City Founder\" (919-936), was the\r\nfirst German ruler who erected a true German kingdom. With quick\r\ndiscernment he founded the authority of the Crown on the union of the\r\ntribes, by reconciling their leaders and enforcing their submission\r\nthrough the ascendency of his own powerful Saxon tribe. Binding them by\r\noath of fealty without detracting from their honour, he met with no\r\nopposition. His son, Otho I., the \"Great,\" obtained the imperial crown\r\nin Rome, and increased the greatness of his new kingdom. Thus we find\r\nEast Helvetia with Chur-Rhaetia forming part of Alamannia, and presently\r\nthe whole country was absorbed into, and its destinies bound up with,\r\nthe vast empire.\r\n\r\nBurkhard I., assuming the title of \"Duke of Alamannia by Divine Right,\"\r\nbent to Henry's royal supremacy with little objection, no doubt feeling\r\nit a safeguard to his own position. His successors likewise held to\r\nGermany, and were faithful adherents of the emperors, who in their turn\r\nstrove to knit Swabia more closely with the empire. This alliance was\r\nhighly valued by them; they had to pass through Chur-Rhaetia on their\r\nexpeditions to Italy; the Alamanni were famous for their prowess; and\r\ntheir religious institutions, St. Gall, Rheinau, and Reichenau, were\r\nfamous centres of culture. Swabia became a highly valuable fief to be\r\ngranted at the pleasure of the emperors. On the death of Burkhard, who\r\nfell in a skirmish whilst accompanying his son-in-law, Rudolf of\r\nBurgundy, to the south, as we have seen above, the duchy devolved on the\r\nson of Otho I., and then on Burkhard II. of Chur-Rhaetia. He never\r\nswerved from his policy of holding to the empire, and his marriage with\r\nOtho's niece, whose beauty and courage and literary skill were\r\ncelebrated in ballad and chronicle, drew the union still closer. On her\r\nhusband's death, Hadwig inherited the title and his estates, but the\r\nduchy was granted to a friend of Otho II. She retired to her favourite\r\nresidence, her manor on Mount Hohentwiel, near Lake Constance, where she\r\nlived in deep seclusion till her death in 994. A good Greek scholar and\r\nfond of learning, she invited young Ekkehard II. of St. Gall to her\r\ncastle, and made him her chaplain and her tutor in classical studies.\r\nHadwig is the central figure in Scheffel's brilliant novel \"Ekkehard,\"\r\nwhich glows with life and sparkling humour, and is a fanciful rendering\r\nof the amusing narratives contained in the St. Gall annals. The\r\nchronicler and the poet combining have produced an immortal work, and\r\nshed a lasting glory on the cloisters of St. Gall.\r\n\r\nAnother famous monastic institution that sprung up about this time,\r\n_i.e._, under the Saxon emperor Otto, and obtained, like Loretto,\r\nEuropean fame as a place of pilgrimage, was that of Einsiedeln, in\r\nCanton Schwyz.\r\n\r\nIn 1024 the Duchy of Swabia was vested in Ernest II., stepson of the\r\nEmperor Conrad II. of the Salic dynasty. A fierce struggle arose on the\r\nquestion of the succession to the Burgundian throne. Ernest claimed\r\nthrough his mother, and Conrad through his wife, niece to Rudolf III.\r\nSeeing his hopes frustrated Ernest, with his friend Werner of Kyburg,\r\nand his party, fell upon the imperial troops, and bloody frays occurred.\r\nErnest was imprisoned, and the manor of Kyburg besieged; but both\r\nfriends escaped, and again combined in new opposition to Conrad. In\r\norder to break their union, the emperor promised his son installation in\r\nBurgundy if he would deliver up his friend. But this was indignantly\r\nrefused, the struggle began anew, and the gallant youths fell in a\r\nskirmish in 1030. Ernest was long a chief figure in mediaeval heroic\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENEALOGICAL TABLES.\r\n\r\nI.

Freeman in his essay on the Holy Empire speaks of\r\nthe Swabian Emperors, the Hohenstaufen.\r\n\r\n[20] Dierauer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nBURGUNDY AND SWABIA UNDER THE GERMAN EMPERORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo return to the kingdom of Burgundy. Rudolf had greatly extended his\r\ndominions; in 919 he added to them the land between the Aare and the\r\nReuss, and in 933 Lower Burgundy, which he had obtained in exchange for\r\nthe Italian crown. The kingdom now comprised West Switzerland, Provence,\r\nDauphine, and Franche Comte. During the king's absence on military\r\nexpeditions, and during the minority of Conrad, Bertha, the \"Spinning\r\nQueen,\" held the reins of government. She is represented on the seal of\r\nthe document founding the convent of Payerne--one of her authenticated\r\nfoundations--with the spinning wheel, and the words _Bertha humilis\r\nregina_ below. This Alpine queen, called by the French Swiss the \"Mother\r\nof their liberties,\" was a model of industry and economy. Like\r\nCharlemagne, she was an excellent housekeeper, and even knew how many\r\neggs had been laid on her estates. Humble in bearing, yet firm and\r\nstrong, this lady fortified the country against the invasions of the\r\nHungarians and Saracens. The gap between the Alps and Mount Jura was\r\nstrengthened by a line of towers still to be seen, though crumbling from\r\nage, at Neuchatel, La Moliere, Moudon, Gourze. These towers were almost\r\ninaccessible, and possessed thick walls, narrow windows, and doors\r\nwhich, being ten feet above the ground, could only be got at by means of\r\nladders. At the first signal of alarm, seigneur and peasantry hurried to\r\nthese strongholds carrying with them whatever they were able; when they\r\nhad entered, the ladders were drawn in, and there the people remained\r\ntill the wild hurricane of savagery had blown over. Gradually the\r\nBurgundians rallied as regular troops to meet the hordes in open battle.\r\n\r\nHerself always busy, Bertha hated idleness, and wherever she went she\r\nwas to be found spinning, even on the road. Who has not heard of the\r\nhumble and graceful queen, riding on her palfrey, spindle in hand, going\r\nfrom house to house, visiting castle, convent, farm, homestead, and hut,\r\ndoing deeds of piety and benevolence? Once, when the Queen of Payerne,\r\nas she was often called, was on her circuits of inspection she met with\r\na peasant girl keeping her flocks, and spinning. Delighted with the\r\ngirl's industry, she gave her a handsome present. Next day all the\r\nladies of her suite appeared before her with spindles in their hands.\r\nSmiling at the sight, she said, \"My ladies, the young peasant girl, like\r\nJacob, has been the first to receive the blessing.\" Space will not allow\r\nus to dwell longer on the memory of the \"Spinning Queen\" which is most\r\ndear to the French Swiss. It should be added, however, that the\r\nBurgundian traditions respecting this queen are doubtless mixed with\r\nmythological elements. In the German religious myths, Bertha (_Berchta_,\r\n_Perahta_,) means what is bright and pure and orderly: she is the\r\nGoddess of Fertility, and the Mother of the Earth, and bestows rich\r\nblessings on mankind.\r\n\r\nOn the death of his father, which had left him a mere child, Bertha's\r\nson Conrad had been educated at the Court of Otho the Great. Fearing\r\nthat Burgundy might become the prey of aggressive neighbours, the\r\nemperor stepped in and made himself protector of the queen, and tutor to\r\nthe children, and naturally exerted much influence on the country.\r\nConrad, coming of age, ruled wisely, and for more than half a century\r\n(937-993), Burgundy flourished. His beautiful sister Adelheid was first\r\nQueen of Italy, but after Lothair's untimely death, became Empress of\r\nGermany, Otho I. wishing to unite Italy with his own empire, making her\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Rudolf III. (993-1032) was greatly harmful to the country,\r\nwhich was fast declining in prestige and prosperity. Better fitted for\r\nthe cloister than for the throne, he lavished his wealth and estates on\r\nthe clergy, with the view of enlisting their help against the\r\nencroaching feudal vassals. In the end, indeed, he was so reduced that\r\nhe was compelled to live on alms from his priests. His own incapacities\r\ndrove him to seek protection from the empire. Having no children, he\r\nappointed his nephew, the Emperor Henry II., heir to his kingdom, and\r\neven during his own lifetime he arranged to give up the reigns of\r\ngovernment to Henry. The opposition of the Burgundian nobles and the\r\nemperor's death prevented this shameful arrangement from actually coming\r\ninto force. The next emperor, Conrad II., prosecuted the claim against\r\nhis stepson, Ernest II., as has been told above, and was crowned king at\r\nthe Cluniacensian convent, founded by Bertha at Payerne, (1033). His\r\nelevation to the Burgundian throne was confirmed in the following year\r\nby a brilliant assembly of Burgundian, German, and Italian bishops and\r\nnobles, at Geneva. Shortly before his death in 1038, he had his son\r\nHenry installed in the kingdom, and the oath of fealty to him was taken\r\nby the Burgundian nobles at the Diet of Solothurn. Switzerland was thus\r\nvery closely allied with the empire; Henry III. holding the reins of\r\ngovernment as King of Burgundy and Duke of Alamannia or Swabia. This\r\nthird amalgamation with the empire told more lastingly and influentially\r\non the country than either the Roman or the Frankish rule had done; to a\r\ngreat extent it stamped on the people the German character and spirit.\r\n\r\nThese external changes, these shifting scenes, these various masters and\r\nsystems of government, naturally affected the internal condition of the\r\ncountry as well. Of the social life of the country, however, we know\r\nvery little. The chroniclers of the period are monks, or noble\r\necclesiastics who wrote of, and for their own class, and the people did\r\nnot enter into their concerns. But the political changes were very\r\ngreat. The Frankish county administrations fell into disuse through the\r\nincrease of immunities granted to royal and ecclesiastical foundations,\r\nby which they were exempted from obedience to the county officers. The\r\ncounts themselves, who had formerly held office at the sovereign's\r\npleasure, gradually made their dignities into hereditary fiefs, which\r\nbecame family property in wealthy and powerful houses. Thus, at the\r\nclose of the ninth and the beginning of the tenth century we already\r\nfind in Switzerland a number of counts, such as the Nellenburger, in\r\nZurichgau; the Lenzburger, in Aargau; the Burkharde, in Chur-Rhaetia; the\r\nKyburger, at Winterthur, near Zurich. The greatest changes, however,\r\nwere effected by the growth of feudalism, which had arisen indeed under\r\nCharlemagne, but had to some extent been checked by him. Feudalism\r\noutgrew all other systems, and entirely disarranged the social scale.\r\nThe free peasantry shrank to a small number, and there sprang up a\r\nmartial nobility of high functionaries, who held offices in the army or\r\ncourts of justice, and exerted much influence. On the native soil, on\r\nthe very meeting-places where the old German people had assembled to\r\ndeal with civil and judicial matters, eminent men founded families which\r\ngrew into reigning houses. These men, combining political discernment\r\nwith military ability and experience, rose above their fellows, and\r\nassumed the highest offices. The distresses, the dissensions, the\r\nintestine wars, and particularly the invasions by savage hordes, drove\r\npeople to seek the protection of powerful lords, even at the risk of\r\nlosing their own independence. In most cases the people became \"unfree,\"\r\nor serfs. Society thus was divided into distinct classes; the old\r\nGerman democracy gave place to a highly aristocratic order, the nobility\r\nruling over the people. Thus, we find Switzerland, like other European\r\ncountries, struggling through her age of feudalism, and centuries must\r\nyet pass before she succeeds in establishing a system of government\r\nwhich alone will suit her peculiar character.\r\n\r\nAt that stage of history the welfare of the country depended to a great\r\nextent on the personal character of the imperial sovereigns. They\r\nvisited Swabia and Burgundy, enforcing order and discipline, holding\r\ndiets at important places, and assigning prerogatives to secular and\r\nreligious foundations. In truth, these imperial visits promoted greatly\r\nthe development of rising cities. Of the German emperors none came so\r\noften to Switzerland as the powerful Salic ruler, Henry III. When he\r\nleft Burgundy--he was often at Basel and Solothurn--the people felt,\r\nsays a contemporary writer, as if the sun had gone down. Henry II. and\r\nHenry III. held imperial diets at Zurich, and the latter used to reside\r\nthere for weeks together, and lavished privileges and gifts on her\r\nreligious foundations. He promoted festivals in the royal palace\r\n(Pfalz), in the Lindencourt; and Zurich was the meeting-place for his\r\nBurgundian and Italian subjects, the capital of Swabia, and residence of\r\nthe Swabian dukes, where they here established their mint. His wise\r\nadministration tended greatly to destroy all political difference and\r\nhostile feeling between the two Helvetias.\r\n\r\nThis national concord (1057-77) was still further strengthened by the\r\nrule of Rudolf of Rheinfelden, who for twenty years swayed the destinies\r\nof the country as \"Rector of Burgundy\" and Duke of Alamannia. The regal\r\nand ducal power had been bestowed upon him by the Empress Agnes, on the\r\ndeath of Henry III., whose son-in-law he was. Rudolf was from the manor\r\nof Rheinfelden, near Basel, and was a distant connection of the\r\nBurgundian royal family. He held vast estates on Geneva lake, and in\r\nSwabia, and thus met with no opposition on the part of the nobility of\r\nBurgundy. But this long period of peace was suddenly and sadly\r\ninterrupted by a terrible catastrophe which fell upon the empire; the\r\nfierce antagonism which arose between Gregory VII. and Henry IV. The\r\nemperor was unwilling to submit to the excessive encroachments of the\r\nChurch, or, rather the Pontiff, on his prerogatives, and like William I.\r\nof England, entirely repudiated the Pope's claims, and tried to check\r\nhis encroachments. The \"Conqueror\" indeed had gained so much power that\r\nthe Pope could not issue excommunications against English subjects\r\nexcept by William's permission, but Henry IV. fell a victim to the\r\nInterdict. Never was sovereign more humiliated by the Papal power, nor\r\nmore humiliated himself to escape the terrible punishment, for\r\ninterdicts were fearful weapons in the hands of the Pontiffs of the\r\nMiddle Ages. The story of this long struggle--how the emperor failed to\r\ncarry his point--his wanderings across the Alps in the depth of\r\nwinter--his submission at Canossa--for all this, full of thrilling\r\ninterest as it is, the reader must be referred to the history of\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATHEDRAL OF LAUSANNE.]\r\n\r\nOn the deposition of Henry, our Rudolf of Rheinfelden was elected king\r\nby the opposing party, and was thence called the Popish king\r\n(Pfaffenkoenig); thus Switzerland, it is almost needless to say, was\r\ndrawn into the struggle and convulsed by intestine wars. The bishops of\r\nLausanne, Geneva, and Basel; the seigneurs of Grandson and Neuchatel,\r\nclung to the emperor; the counts of Geneva and Toggenburg, the houses of\r\nHabsburg, Kyburg, and Savoy, and the clergy of Alamannia and Chur-Rhaetia\r\nsided with the new king. St. Gall rallied round its valiant abbot,\r\nUlrich III., to uphold the cause of Henry. The wars were continued with\r\nalternate successes and reverses on each side, till the death of Rudolf\r\nin 1080 on the Grona, near Leipzig, it was said by the hand of Godefroi\r\nde Bouillon, the famous crusader, who fought on the side of Henry. The\r\nintensity of bitter feeling gradually abated. Henry even tried to\r\nestablish his royal authority in Burgundy, but in Alamannia new quarrels\r\nbroke out on the question of the succession to the duchy. Two native\r\nSwabian dukes contended for the duchy, Frederick von Staufen,\r\ngrandfather of Frederick Barbarossa, the ancestor of the illustrious\r\ndynasty, and Duke Bertold von Zaeringen, brother-in-law and heir to the\r\nestates of the son of the late Rudolf of Rheinfelden, who died shortly\r\nafter his father. The differences were settled by a diet at Mayence, in\r\n1097, and Frederick von Staufen, son-in-law to Henry, who had staunchly\r\nupheld and fought for the imperial cause in the Popish quarrels, was\r\ninvested with the Swabian duchy. Yet his power on the Swiss side of the\r\nRhine was more nominal than real, and it was exerted by Bertold II. of\r\nZaeringen, who received in compensation for the loss of the duchy the\r\nducal title, and the _Reichsvogtei Zuerich_ (a kind of prefecture),\r\ntogether with the royal prerogatives over the secular and religious\r\ninstitutions of the city. For Zurich was then the noblest and most\r\nconspicuous town in Swabia, as Bishop Otto von Freysingen, the most\r\nprominent historian of the Middle Ages, asserts. This severance of Swiss\r\nAlamannia, and particularly of the imperial prefecture of Zurich, from\r\nthe empire tended greatly to bring about the gradual political\r\nseparation. Under the Zaeringer came again a long period of comparative\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF THE HOUSE OF ZAERINGEN.\r\n\r\n(1050-1218.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rule of the Dukes of Zaeringen ushered in a long period of\r\ncomparative peace (1100-1218), which improved the social and material\r\ncondition of the people. Yet this time of peace was every now and again\r\ninterrupted in the west by feuds with the Burgundian nobles. This\r\nSwabian family took their name from the ancestral manor of Zaeringen,\r\nnear Freiburg, in the Breisgau (Black Forest). The vast estates they had\r\nderived from the House of Rheinfelden on its extinction reached from\r\nLake Geneva to the rivers Aare and Emme, and gave them a dominant\r\nposition in the country at the opening of the twelfth century.\r\n\r\nBurgundy had been slowly falling away from the empire during its\r\ninternal dissensions and its conflicts with the Papacy. But on the death\r\nof Count William IV., who was assassinated by his own people in 1127,\r\nthe Emperor Lothair drew that province more closely to his realm, by\r\nbestowing the regency of it on his adherent, Conrad of Zaeringen.\r\nConrad's position was, however, violently contested by Rainald III., a\r\nrelative of the murdered count. The Burgundian nobles rallied round him,\r\nand made a desperate stand against German interference, and he\r\nmaintained his independence in the Franche Comte, as the district was\r\nsubsequently called. When Frederick Barbarossa married Beatrix, the\r\ndaughter and heiress of Rainald, he claimed the Burgundian territory,\r\nand came into conflict with the Zaeringer. Berchtold IV. obtained the\r\nposition of suzerain over the sees of Geneva, Lausanne, and Sion, and by\r\nthis division Swiss Burgundy was being lopped off from its appendage\r\nbeyond Mount Jura. The insubordinate prelates joined with secular\r\nprinces to upset the German rule. To guard against these protracted\r\nstruggles, and to increase their own influence in the country, the\r\nZaeringer resorted to a means which does them great credit, and which\r\nwon for them the affection of the people. They began to found towns, as\r\nthey had done in Germany, or to raise settlements into fortified cities,\r\nand granted them extensive liberties. The lesser nobles and the common\r\npeople found shelter in these walled towns against the over-bearing\r\namongst the high nobility; trade and industry began to thrive, and these\r\ncity commonwealths rose to a flourishing condition, and became a source\r\nof wealth as well as a staunch support to their founders.\r\n\r\nBertold or Berchtold IV. (1152-1186) planned a whole strategical line of\r\nstrongholds in the west, as a check on the nobles; and in 1177 he\r\nfounded the free city of Freiburg on his own estates. The situation, on\r\na high plateau above the Saane, was on the line of demarcation between\r\nthe French and German tongues. To this new town he granted a charter of\r\nliberties similar to that granted to its sister foundation of the same\r\nname in the Breisgau.\r\n\r\nBerchtold V. (1186-1218) followed in the steps of his father. He founded\r\nand fortified Burgdorf, Moudon, Yverdon, Laupen, Murten, Guemminen, Thun.\r\nThese towns he founded to be not only places of military strength, but\r\nalso centres of industry and trade, which should increase the prosperity\r\nof his people. But he had, however, to stand against the heavy\r\nopposition of the Burgundian nobles. As he was preparing to set out on a\r\ncrusade with Frederick Barbarossa they rose in arms. Hastening back, he\r\ndefeated the refractory rebels, both at Avenches and in the Grindelwald\r\nvalley, in 1191, and immediately after his victories he resumed his\r\nstrategical projects. On a promontory washed by the Aare, and on\r\nimperial crown lands, he raised a new citadel, to which he gave the name\r\nof Bern, in memory of Dietrich of Berne (Verona), a favourite hero of\r\nAlamannic mediaeval poetry.[21] The lesser nobles of the neighbourhood,\r\nas well as the humbler people, poured into Bern for shelter, and,\r\nreceiving a most liberal charter, these burgesses rapidly rose to wealth\r\nand power. Being built on imperial land, Bern took from the first a\r\nhigher standing than the sister town, Freiburg.\r\n\r\nThese city foundations form a chief corner-stone in the fabric of Swiss\r\nliberties. Attaining political independence, the towns held their own\r\nagainst aggressors. To effect their deliverance from oppression, they\r\nunited with kindred communities or with powerful princes, and thus began\r\nthe system of offensive and defensive alliances.\r\n\r\nA new enemy arose in the West, and Berchtold V. was defeated by Count\r\nThomas of Savoy (1211), who encroached on Vaud, and seized Moudon. Yet\r\nthe Zaeringer steadily and successfully strengthened their hold over the\r\ncountry, and obtained the most complete independence. And, indeed, the\r\nmoment seemed drawing near when Switzerland was to be shaped into a\r\ndurable monarchical state. However, she was spared that fate--from which\r\nno patriotic act of any national hero could probably have rescued\r\nher--by a natural, yet providential, event, the extinction of the ducal\r\nfamily. For in 1218 Berchtold V. died, leaving no issue.\r\n\r\nThis century is eminently an age of religious movements. And, although\r\nour space will not permit us to enter into full details, yet it is\r\nimpossible to pass over the great religious revival which centred in the\r\nCrusades, that is, so far as that movement touches Switzerland.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of December, in the year 1146, a most touching scene might\r\nhave been witnessed in the minster of Schaffhausen. The Alamannic people\r\nwere thronging the church to listen to a glowing sermon from a French\r\nCistercian monk, Bernard de Clairvaux. Vividly depicting the distress\r\nof the Christians in Palestine, he invited his hearers to join the\r\nsecond crusade. France was ready, he said, but the House of Hohenstaufen\r\nwas still wavering. His captivating manner, his noble earnestness, and\r\nthe elegance and flow of his language--though it was but half understood\r\nby the masses--stirred the audience to bursts of enthusiasm. \"Your land\r\nis fertile,\" were the concluding words of the monk, \"and the world is\r\nfilled with the reputation of your valour. Ye soldiers of Christ, arise!\r\nand hurl down the enemies of the Cross!\" Laying his hands on the blind\r\nand lame, says the half-legendary story, he restored to them eyesight or\r\nthe use of limbs, and, strewing crosses amongst the crowds, left the\r\nchurch. The people, in a state of ecstatic fervour, beat their breasts,\r\nand, shedding tears, broke into a shout of \"Kyrie eleison, the saints\r\nare with us!\"[22] On the 15th of the same month Bernard preached at\r\nZurich, and on Christmas Day at Speyer, before Conrad III., whom he won\r\nfor the crusade. His fervent exhortations seem to have found willing\r\nears, too, in the country. Schaffhausen and Einsiedeln took an active\r\nshare in the work. We hear of almost countless numbers of spiritual and\r\nsecular princes, nobles, knights, and lesser people who joined in the\r\ncrusade. The counts of Montfort, Kyburg, Habsburg, Zaeringen, and\r\nNeuchatel, and bishops and abbots started for the East. Contemporary\r\nwriters bewail the loss of so many of the best and bravest of South\r\nGermany who died in Palestine. The holy orders of the Knights of St.\r\nJohn, of the Teutonic order, and the Knights-Templars raised their\r\naristocratic institutions in this country; new orders of monastic\r\nfoundations sprang up, which we cannot here dwell upon. Amongst these\r\nnew orders were that of Mendicant Friars, though it is worthy of note\r\nthat these played no such part in Switzerland as they did in England.\r\n\r\nYet the Burgundian or western portion of the country plunged more deeply\r\ninto the movement than did the eastern part. German enthusiasm was but\r\nslowly won by French religious ecstasy, which had to a great extent\r\nstarted the Crusades. Still the age was filled with religious and\r\nromantic frenzy. Not the mere practical aims of conquest or gain it was\r\nthat stirred men's minds, but the mystical elements of the movement, and\r\nthe grand, novel, and indeed fabulous sights that were to be witnessed;\r\nand the old love of wandering and adventure revived, and drove men to\r\nthe East. By a happy coincidence the effect of Bernard's sermons was\r\nlessened to some extent in this country by the previous teachings of\r\nanother enthusiast of a far different stamp. The intrepid Italian\r\nreformer, Arnold of Brescia, had for some time preached at Zurich and\r\nConstance, sowing the seeds of heresy. Boldly attacking the abuses of\r\nthe Church, and advocating the return to the simplicity of the apostolic\r\nteaching, he invited people to no longer lavish wealth on Church\r\ninstitutions. Arnold fell a victim to his advanced religious and\r\npolitical views, but his teachings took hold of the people of the Alpine\r\ndistricts. To his influence may safely be attributed the staunch\r\nresistance to Papal aggressiveness shown in the thirteenth century by\r\nthe people of Zurich and of the Forest Cantons.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] See Nibelungen.\r\n\r\n[22] Prof. Baechtold, \"Sermon Literature in Switzerland.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSES OF KYBURG, SAVOY, AND HABSBURG.\r\n\r\n(1218-1273.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are nearing the period of their history most dear to the Swiss, the\r\nperiod when the Eidgenossenschaft is forming, but before reaching it we\r\nhave still to make our way as best we can through a short era of chaotic\r\nfeudalism and political confusion generally, preceding the great\r\nstruggle for Swiss independence. On the extinction of the House of\r\nZaeringen Switzerland fell a prey to the designs of vassal princes who\r\nhad started into eminence on her soil, and now contended for supremacy\r\nover her. The realm of the Zaeringen sovereigns fell to pieces, the\r\nSwiss portions with Freiburg, Burgdorf, Thun, going to a native prince,\r\nUlrich, Count of Kyburg, brother-in-law of Berchtold V.; the Swabian\r\nportions to a German relative. Thus Switzerland was cut off from Swabia.\r\nThe crown lands he had held in Swiss Burgundy, and likewise the royal\r\nprerogative, fell to the empire, and the Vice-regency, being vested by\r\nFrederick II. in his younger son, Henry, became gradually nominal and at\r\nlength died out. In this way all vassal princes in the west, and all the\r\nterritorial lordships and free cities, such as Bern, Solothurn, Morat,\r\nLaupen, Guemminen, which were built on crown lands, and had been\r\nsubjected to the Zaerings, were now held directly from the emperor.\r\nZurich was likewise restored to the empire. By this time most of these\r\nplaces had become virtually independent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHATEAU DE VUFFLENS, VAUD. (_Fourteenth Century._)]\r\n\r\nSwitzerland reflects most faithfully the feudal and political condition\r\nof the empire at large. It was torn into an almost countless number of\r\nspiritual and secular territorial sovereignties. Taking advantage of the\r\nstate of distraction prevailing throughout the realm, Church prelates,\r\nreligious foundations, the greater and lesser nobles, and even the\r\nthriving burgesses of great city commonwealths, all strove to erect\r\ntheir lands into petty independent dominions. The bishops assumed\r\ntemporal power in their own dioceses; the religious-houses, owing to\r\ntheir \"rich immunities,\" enjoyed almost perfect freedom. The peasantry\r\nhad dwindled into small bodies of men, and in the place of the Frankish\r\ncounty-officers (counts) a martial nobility had sprung up, and, grasping\r\nthe public functions and dignities, had turned these offices into\r\nfreeholds independent of the sovereign. Henceforward they assumed the\r\nnames of the feudal manors they held, and began to raise\r\n_chateaux-forts_ on commanding or picturesque spots. As many as two\r\nhundred territorial rulers held their feudal sway in Switzerland. To\r\ngive even the names of these would be not only useless but absurd, yet\r\nthey had their share in the political development of the country.\r\n\r\nIn the Low Valais the counts of Savoy had obtained a footing, and were\r\nmoreover advancing into Vaud. Vaud was at that time governed by a host\r\nof more or less important nobles, such as the barons of Grandson,\r\nCossonay, Blonay, &c., and was contended for by the bishops of Lausanne\r\nand Geneva, and the counts of the latter town, whilst the counts of\r\nGreyerz governed in the districts of the Saane, and those of Neuchatel\r\nin the lake districts of the Jura. Little Burgundy, with Solothurn as\r\ncapital, fell to the counts of Buchegg. One of the wealthiest and most\r\nancient of the native families was that of Lenzburg, whose counts held\r\nsway in Aargau, Zurichgau, and the Forest Cantons, and were governors of\r\nfamous religious-houses. One of the counts of Lenzburg, Ulrich IX., was\r\nan intimate friend and a minister of Frederick Barbarossa, and on the\r\nextinction of the rule of these counts, their heritage fell to the\r\nHabsburgs, and gave that family a great lift in the early days of their\r\nrise. In the east we meet with the famous House of Kyburg, to which\r\nbelonged young Werner, the friend of Ernest II. of Swabia. Their\r\nancestral manor house near Winterthur is still in good condition. They\r\nhad numerous vassals and followers. In Zurichgau the barons of\r\nRegensberg and others, and the counts of Rapperswyl were harassing the\r\npeople. The most powerful nobles in the east were the abbots of St.\r\nGall, who governed part of St. Gall and Appenzell, and the counts of\r\nToggenburg, and in Chur-Rhaetia and the Rhine districts the counts of\r\nMontfort and Werdenberg. This sufficiently shows how feudalism had grown\r\napace in Switzerland, and what a hard struggle the people had to hold\r\ntheir own against the impositions of princes and nobles. How feudalism\r\nhad arisen has been already shown in the previous chapter.\r\n\r\nTo find some explanation of this rapid growth and the distracted state\r\nthat followed in its train we must turn for a moment to the empire.\r\nOwing no doubt to the loftiness of the imperial dignity--for the\r\nemperors were indisputably the greatest of the civilized monarchs--the\r\nvassal princes rose to far greater independence in the empire than in\r\nother countries. Yet the possession of the imperial crown was in the end\r\nthe weakening of royalty. Henry III. had raised the empire to its\r\npinnacle of greatness, and the imperial dignity increased the prestige\r\nof the German name, and surrounded the German monarch with a halo of\r\nglory and even reverence. But the engagements abroad, the campaigns in\r\nItaly, the struggles with the Pontiffs, and the close attention required\r\nto be paid to Italian affairs, kept the emperors away from duties and\r\ncares nearer home. The Italian claims and titles, in fact, proved in the\r\nlong run injurious to German interests. Frederick I., Barbarossa, had\r\nindeed, by his just and powerful rule, forced his insubordinate vassals\r\ninto submission, but it was far different with his grandson, the\r\nbrilliant Frederick II. (1215-50). Born in Italy and brought up to love\r\nthe land of his birth, Naples and Sicily, more than his fatherland,\r\nFrederick II. was more Southerner than Teuton. He gave Southern Italy a\r\nmodel administration, but allowed Germany to be weakened by a divided\r\ninternal government. And though we cannot but admire the unflinching\r\nspirit with which this \"wonder of the world\" carried on his unequal\r\nstruggle with the Papacy, yet it is clear that the conflict which sealed\r\nthe doom of his own family was equally ruinous to the empire.[23]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRONZE FIGURES FROM THE MAXIMILIAN MONUMENT AT\r\nINNSBRUCK.]\r\n\r\nDuring the interregnum (1254-73) Germany was without an actual ruler,\r\nalthough two foreign princes had been elected as its sovereigns. One of\r\nthese never even showed his face in Germany, and the other, Richard of\r\nCornwall, could not make sure his ascendency in the country,\r\nnotwithstanding all the money he lavished in the attempt. This was the\r\nunhappy time of the _Faustrecht_--the name indicates its character--when\r\nthe right of the strong hand (fist) alone was of avail. The empire lost\r\nits prestige, and it slowly dissolved into a loose confederacy of some\r\nfive thousand larger or smaller states and fragments of states, each\r\nstruggling for independence.\r\n\r\nMost eminent amongst the crowd of nobles on Swiss soil aiming at their\r\npersonal exaltation were the counts of the great Houses of Kyburg,\r\nSavoy, and Habsburg. Taking advantage of the general state of\r\nmisgovernment or want of government, they systematically planned the\r\naggrandisement of their own families, whether by conquest, purchase, or\r\nunjust encroachment. Yet there was opposition from the city burgesses,\r\nwho, seeing their liberties in danger, felt the love of freedom roused\r\nin their breasts.\r\n\r\nThe powerful Kyburger, the mightiest Swiss nobles, were the first to\r\nthreaten the liberties of the people. Count Ulrich was reckoned one of\r\nthe wealthiest princes throughout Swabia. By clever policy he had\r\narranged the union of his son Hartmann (the elder) with Margaretha of\r\nSavoy. Ulrich's daughter, too, was married to Albrecht of Habsburg, and\r\nbecame the mother of Rudolf, the German king. He upheld the cause of\r\nFrederick II., and his elder son, Werner, went with him on his crusade\r\nwhere he was carried off by the plague, leaving one son, Hartmann the\r\nYounger. Their territories, after they had inherited the Zaeringen\r\nestates, reached from Lake Constance to Swiss Burgundy. Both the elder\r\nand the younger Hartmann encroached without scruple on the crown lands\r\nadjoining their estates, whilst Frederick II. was engaged in his\r\nstruggle with the Church. In this emergency Bern and Murten, whose\r\nindependence was at stake, followed suit, and resorted to means which\r\nwould be a precedent in the future struggles for Swiss freedom. They\r\njoined in an offensive and defensive union with the Kyburg city,\r\nFreiburg, with Lucerne and the Bishop of Sion (1243). Bern had always\r\nadhered closely to the Hohenstaufen, and when Hartmann ventured on an\r\nopen attack in 1255, that city applied to the empire for help. Unable to\r\nobtain support, however, both Bern and Murten placed themselves under\r\nthe patronage of Count Peter of Savoy, who was already at variance with\r\nKyburg, and a peace was arranged.\r\n\r\nPeter of Savoy, \"the second Charlemagne\" as he was styled, was a most\r\nremarkable man, and a striking figure amongst the Savoy princes. Being\r\nthe fourth of seven brothers he had been placed in the Church by his\r\nfather, Count Thomas. However, on the death of the father Peter doffed\r\nhis priestly robes, married the heiress of Faucigny, and added that\r\nprovince and Chablais to his territories, and set up as guardian of his\r\nbrothers. Like his father he had constantly his mind on Vaud, and the\r\ndaily feuds amongst its leaderless swarm of nobles facilitated the\r\nconquest. Castles were erected to further his object; and Chillon, which\r\nto-day gives us an excellent idea of what a fine feudal castle was in\r\nmediaeval days, became his princely residence, having indeed been, to a\r\ngreat extent, built by him. Invited to the Court of England by his niece\r\nEleanor, he spent the greater part of his life abroad, gathering in the\r\nservice of Henry III. men and money. These he used to achieve the\r\nacquisition of Vaud, to which he every now and then returned to\r\noverthrow his enemies. In England he occupied a high position in the\r\nCouncil, was knighted, and had titles and honours lavished on him; the\r\npalace of the Savoy in the Strand bears witness to his magnificence.\r\nMany of the nobles in his train, such as De la Porte, Grandson,\r\nFlechere, married Englishwomen, and hence arose the family names of\r\nPorter, Grandison, Fletcher. Possessing an iron will, and thoroughly\r\nversed in diplomacy, Peter of Savoy finally annexed Vaud, partly by\r\nconquest and partly by agreement. In truth, the whole nobility lay at\r\nhis feet ready to do him homage and acknowledge him as lord paramount.\r\nThe German government sanctioned his protectorate of Bern and Morat, and\r\nRichard of Cornwall his conquests in the Bernese Highlands. Thus West\r\nSwitzerland became the portion of a Savoy prince, and in the place of\r\nthe ancient kingdom of Upper Burgundy arose a feudal sovereignty.\r\nHowever, order, discipline, and wise organization were the fruits of\r\nPeter's rule. And his generous nature, his chivalrous spirit, and his\r\nlove of justice and good government, won for him the affection of his\r\npeople, and the title of Le Petit, or Le Second, Charlemagne.\r\n\r\nPresently the Kyburg domains in Eastern Switzerland devolved on him, the\r\nmale line having died out in 1264--the elder Hartmann leaving no\r\nchildren, and the younger but one daughter, Anna, a minor. But when\r\nPeter attempted to take possession of the inheritance in the name of his\r\nsister, Margaretha of Savoy, he found himself in conflict with a rival\r\nclaimant of superior strength, Rudolf, of Habsburg. This prince\r\nconfiscated the whole of the lands of Hartmann the Elder, regardless of\r\nthe claims of the widow, Margaretha. There was no mistaking the meaning\r\nof this, and war broke out between Savoy and Habsburg. Rudolf invited\r\nthe whole of the nobles of the west to rise against Count Peter. He was\r\nengaged in East Switzerland when the Burgundian lords proceeded to\r\nbesiege Chillon, in 1266. Peter himself was at war in the Valais. He\r\nsuddenly returned, and at dead of night fell upon the enemy. He found\r\nthem asleep, and some eighty nobles, barons, counts, seigneurs, and\r\nfollowers fell into his hands. These he conducted into the castle of\r\nChillon, but instead of treating them as prisoners, entertained them at\r\na banquet. Thus Peter became once more master of the west. Bern by a\r\n\"writ of submission\" regained from the House of Savoy the freedom it\r\nhad forfeited on a previous occasion.[24] Rudolf signed a peace at\r\nMorat, and obtained the Kyburg heritage with the exception of the lands\r\nsettled on the Dowager Countess. On the death of the \"Conqueror of\r\nVaud,\" which occurred soon after, the sovereignty passed to his brother\r\nPhilip, a man of far inferior stamp. French Switzerland, save Geneva,\r\ngradually became a loose confederation of petty states, and their\r\nlanguishing political life led to their gradual amalgamation with the\r\nEastern Republics.\r\n\r\nThe most dangerous champion enters the lists when the great Habsburg\r\nprince seizes on the reins of government in Switzerland. In its early\r\nstages the rule of the Habsburger is closely linked with, and is indeed\r\nthe incitement to, the national movement or rising, if such a word may\r\nbe applied in the case of a people just forming. The famous Habsburg\r\nfamily was of right noble and ancient lineage. Whether they sprang from\r\nSwiss soil (Aargau), or had their origin in Alsacia, is not quite\r\nsettled. As a matter of fact, they were a Swabian family who possessed\r\nvast estates in both those countries. Their estates, (\"Eigen,\" allods or\r\nfreeholds) with Windisch, Brugg Nurri, lay at the junction of the Aare\r\nand Reuss, in Aargau. Originally they dwelt in the castle of Altenburg,\r\nnear Brugg, and subsequently in their manor of Habsburg, on the\r\nWuelpelsberg,[25] a little hill overlooking the ancient Vindonissa.\r\nNumerous other castles they held as time went on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD HABSBURG CASTLE (CANTON AARGAU).]\r\n\r\nRudolf der Alte (the Old) is the first of the ancestors of whom we know\r\nmuch. He accompanied Frederick II. on his campaigns, and that great\r\nemperor stood godfather to his son Rudolf, who was later on to wear his\r\nroyal crown. On his death the dynasty split into two branches,\r\nHabsburg-Austria (senior), and Habsburg-Laufenburg Aargau (junior), the\r\nheads being respectively Albrecht the Wise and Rudolf the Silent, his\r\nsons. Each of these branches followed its own separate policy, the\r\njunior holding to the Papacy. Albrecht cleverly contrived to marry\r\nHeilwig of Kyburg, hoping thus to inherit the estates of her childless\r\nbrother, Hartmann the elder. He died, it was rumoured, whilst engaged in\r\none of the crusades, and his estates passed to his sons, of whom,\r\nhowever, but one survived, our Rudolf of Habsburg. This man within the\r\nspace of thirty years made his family one of the mightiest in the\r\nempire. Rudolf inherited from his father the family estate on the Aare,\r\nwith Habsburg Castle. Besides this, he succeeded to various titles and\r\nlands, to the lordship of several towns in the Aargau, to the prefecture\r\n(_Vogtei_) over the religious-houses of Saeckingen and Muri, to the\r\nlandgraviate of Alsacia, and so forth.\r\n\r\nThough but one-and-twenty when his father died, Rudolf at once\r\ndisplayed great energy, as well as firmness and caution. In the struggle\r\nwith the Papacy he held to the Staufen. It mattered little to him that\r\nhis estates were under an interdict, and himself excommunicated. He held\r\nfaithfully to the illustrious dynasty, and accompanied its last\r\nrepresentative, Conradin, across the Alps, to Verona, in 1267. On the\r\ndeath of Conradin on the scaffold at Naples, and the consequent\r\nextinction of the Staufen line, Rudolf veered gradually round to the\r\nside of the Pope.\r\n\r\nRudolf was highly popular with the peasantry, winning their hearts by\r\nhis affability, simple habits, and kindly good-nature. His tall and\r\nslender person, thin face, and aquiline nose, were striking features,\r\nand not easily forgotten when once seen. He had been known to mend with\r\nhis own hands, after a campaign, the old grey coat he usually wore, and\r\nthis was but a typical act of his. And the proud opposition he offered\r\nto a plundering nobility quite won for him the confidence of the people.\r\nThe great cities stood on good terms with him, and sought his friendship\r\nand aid. Thus did the Alsacian towns seek his help against the bishops\r\nof Strasburg; Zurich against the barons of Regensberg and Toggenburg. On\r\nmany an occasion did he render remarkable service in this way, of which\r\none instance must suffice. The barons of Regensberg had a castle on the\r\nUto, a mountain towering above Zurich, and from thence often sent men to\r\nwaylay and rob the citizens who chanced to pass that way. Rudolf hit on\r\na crafty device. Riding up the Uetliberg with thirty men of Zurich, he\r\nplaced behind each man a companion, and so came to the gate of the\r\ncastle. The garrison despising a band apparently so small, rushed out of\r\nthe gates upon them. But great was their terror when suddenly the men\r\nriding behind appeared in sight, and, taking to flight, they left the\r\ncastle at the mercy of the strange attacking party. The place was\r\nlevelled with the ground. Rudolf was asked by a body of free men of Uri\r\nto be their umpire in a dispute, and he actually sat in judgment on the\r\nmatter, under the linden at Altorf, a fact which bears witness to his\r\npopularity amongst the people. Yet, with many amiable qualities, Rudolf\r\nwas covetous, ambitious, and violent. Bent on raising his family to\r\ngreatness, he reveals a most mercenary spirit, and shows himself\r\nunscrupulous in the pursuit of gain. It has been shown above, how he had\r\nseized the Kyburg lands; he also made himself guardian of Anna of\r\nKyburg, and when she came of age, united her to his cousin, Eberhard of\r\nHabsburg. Thus was founded the new House of Kyburg-Burgdorf. He obtained\r\nfrom them Anna's heritage in the Aargau, besides Zug, Art, Willisan,\r\nSempach, &c., as well as lands in the Forest Cantons. He was one of\r\nthose chieftains who profited immensely by the distraction during the\r\ninterregnum.\r\n\r\nWhilst engaged in storming Basel, whose bishop had encroached on the\r\nAlsacian territories, the news was brought to Rudolf (October 1, 1273)\r\nthat he had been elected King of Germany, at Frankfort, and, raising the\r\nsiege, he at once proceeded to his coronation at Aix-la-Chapelle.\r\n\r\nRudolf's influence greatly altered the policy of Germany. He made his\r\npeace with Gregory X. at Lausanne in 1275, and entered into a close\r\nalliance with him. Thus an end was put to the unfortunate quarrels with\r\nthe Papal power, and the German king was set at liberty to follow his\r\nown ambitions, aims, and plans. He resigned all claim to Italy, and so\r\nfar also to the imperial dignity, which had once been of such splendour,\r\nand had indeed been almost equivalent to the government of the whole\r\nworld. Sober, cautious, and matter-of-fact as he was, Rudolf cared not\r\nfor merely ideal greatness, and devoted himself to following more\r\npractical aims. The empire had been impoverished by the late crisis, and\r\nby the different calamities which had befallen it; and the German\r\nprinces had risen to positions of defiant independence. Seeing\r\nbeforehand that the authority of the crown must be founded on the wealth\r\nand hereditary possessions of the sovereign, Rudolf made the\r\naggrandisement of his family the chief object of his career. Fortune's\r\nfavourite he seemed indeed to be, and gained a great victory over his\r\nopponent to the throne, Ottokar of Bohemia (1278), and secured from him\r\nthe Duchy of Austria, with Steyermark. This he vested as a new\r\npossession in his own family.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the extension of his power eastward, he likewise\r\ncontinued his aggressive policy in Switzerland. He forced from Philip of\r\nSavoy the cession of Payerne, Murten, &c., and waged war with Bern,\r\nwhich held to Savoy, refusing to pay the royal taxes (1279). Making\r\nample use of his exalted position and unlimited power, he lost no\r\nopportunity of buying up princes and religious-houses in pecuniary\r\ndifficulties. He compelled the Abbots of St. Gall, Alrich of Guettingen,\r\nand William of Montfort, to cede to him lands and farms, forcing on them\r\nas steward a worthless fellow who was a devoted adherent of the\r\nHabsburgs. When the male line of Rapperswyl died out, the fiefs which\r\nshould have passed to the Abbey of St. Gall, he gave to his own sons.\r\nAnd, taking advantage of the pecuniary straits of the monastery of\r\nNurbach, he obtained by one means or another Lucerne, which belonged to\r\nthe abbey, as well as numerous farms reaching into the Forest Cantons.\r\nThe stewardship of Einsiedeln and Pfaeffers likewise fell to his share.\r\nMany more instances might be given to show how Rudolf's clever and\r\nunscrupulous scheming extended his power all over the midlands and the\r\neastern districts, and how grievously his heavy hand was felt throughout\r\nthe country. Yet the famous Habsburgs, able, warlike, and energetic as\r\nthey were, met with one obstacle to their progress which they were\r\nunable to remove, and against which all their plans came to nought---the\r\nlove of freedom innate in the Swiss peoples.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[23] For more complete account of the Hohenstaufen see Freeman's \"Holy\r\nRoman Empire,\" Frederick I., II.\r\n\r\n[24] The story runs that Peter allowed the town to ask a favour in\r\nreturn for past services, and the witty men of Bern at once begged for\r\nthe restitution of their lost liberty. Henceforth Peter was regarded as\r\nthe benefactor and second founder of the city.\r\n\r\n[25] Tradition says that one of their ancestors, Radbot, hunting in the\r\nAargau, lost his favourite hawk, and found it sitting on the ridge of\r\nthe Wuelpelsberg. Being delighted with the view, Radbot built a castle\r\nthere, and called it _Hawk Castle_, Habichtsburg, or Habsburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nTHE CONFEDERATION, OR EIDGENOSSENSCHAFT.\r\n\r\n(1231-1291.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the present chapter we have to attempt the task of separating truth\r\nfrom fiction, at all times, perhaps, a difficult, and often an\r\nimpossible, undertaking, in matters of history. This chapter indeed\r\nsplits itself naturally into _Wahrheit_ and _Dichtung_. Fortunately the\r\nstories of Tell and the three Eidgenossen are everywhere well known, and\r\nwill need but little description at our hands.\r\n\r\nA lake of exquisite beauty extends between the Forest Cantons, and, so\r\nto speak, links them together, the whole forming a singularly\r\npicturesque stretch of country. Separated from the sister cantons and\r\nfrom the outside world, each of these little states formed a world of\r\nits own. The lake was the common outlet, and the rallying-point for the\r\npeoples of the secluded valleys. The various armlets into which it\r\nbranches, like the districts which lie about them, have each their\r\npeculiar charm. Of these cantons Unterwalden has a pastoral character,\r\nand attracts attention by its beautiful verdure--velvety slopes, green\r\nmeads, clusters of nut-trees in the lower parts, orchards of fruit\r\ntrees, the country dotted everywhere with sunburnt huts, forming a _tout\r\nensemble_ truly idyllic. Schwyz is a canton of similar natural\r\nappearance, with green pastures and somewhat gentler slopes, but broad\r\nterraces with their red cottages line the valley. Above the chief town\r\nof the same name, which nestles at the head of the dale it commands,\r\nshining, dazzlingly white with its snug whitewashed houses, rise to the\r\nsky the torn but imposing pyramids of the two Myten. Uri is _par\r\nexcellence_ the highland district amongst the three little states.\r\nTowering mountains and inaccessible rocks hem in a strip of water, and\r\ngive that wondrous hue which makes the charm of Uri lake.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants are of the Alpine mould. Sinewy, robust, quick, shrewd,\r\nthey are persevering, fearless, bold, and self-reliant; they are yet\r\nsimple in their habits, artless in manner, pious, and strongly\r\nconservative, each people having however its own characteristic points\r\nof difference. Ever exposed to danger, their struggles with nature for\r\nthe supply of their daily wants have increased their strength of body,\r\nbrought out their mettle, and quickened their natural intelligence. Thus\r\nit was not the love of innovation, or even of reform, that led them to\r\nform their \"League of Perpetual Alliance,\" in 1291. They entered into\r\nthe Confederation but to check the aggressions of the Habsburgers.\r\n\r\nSuch is the district and such the race from which arose the three famed\r\nEidgenossen, Walter Fuerst von Attinghausen, Werner Staufacher, and\r\nArnold von Melchthal, who, on the \"Ruetli,\" swore a solemn oath to save\r\ntheir country from rulers shameless as they were cruel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THALER OF THREE CANTONS--URI, SCHWYZ, AND UNTERWALDEN\r\n[SANCTUS MARTINUS EPISCOPUS].\r\n\r\n(_By Dr. Imhoof._)]\r\n\r\nTradition reports that King Albrecht, son of Rudolf (1298-1308), greatly\r\noppressed the three Waldstaetten, doing his best to reduce the people to\r\nthe condition of bondmen. To the various stewards or bailiffs whom he\r\nset over them, he gave strict orders to keep well in check the people of\r\nthe Forest Cantons. These overseers grew into covetous and cruel\r\ntyrants, who taxed, fined, imprisoned, and reviled the unfortunate\r\ninhabitants. To complain to the monarch was useless, as he refused to\r\nlisten. One of these stewards, or lieutenant-governors, was Gessler, and\r\na particularly haughty and spiteful governor he was. Passing on one\r\noccasion through Steinen (Schwyz), he was struck by the sight of a fine\r\nstone-built house, and filled with envy he inquired of Werner\r\nStaufacher, who happened to be the owner, whose it was. Fearing the\r\ngovernor's anger the wealthy proprietor replied cautiously, \"The holding\r\nis the king's, your grace's, and mine.\" \"Can we suffer the peasantry to\r\nlive in such fine houses?\" exclaimed Gessler, scornfully, as he rode\r\naway. Landenberg, another of these \"unjust stewards,\" at Sarnen, being\r\ninformed that a rich farmer in the Melchi (Unterwalden), had a fine pair\r\nof oxen, sent his man for them. Young Arnold, of Melchthal, the son of\r\nthe farmer, was standing by when the animals were being unyoked, and,\r\nenraged at the sight, raised his stick, and struck the governor's\r\nservant a blow, breaking one of his fingers. But being afraid of the\r\ngovernor's wrath, young Arnold fled. So Landenberg seized the old\r\nfather, brought him to his castle, and had his eyes put out.\r\n\r\nWerner Staufacher was consumed by secret grief, and his wife, guessing\r\nwhat was on his mind, gave him such counsel that, nerving himself to\r\naction, he went over to Uri and Unterwalden to look for kindred spirits\r\nand fellow-sufferers. At the house of Walter Fuerst, of Attinghausen\r\n(Uri), he met with the young man from the Melchi, to whom he was able to\r\ntell the sad news that the old father had been blinded by Landenberg.\r\nHere the three patriots unburdened to each other their sorrowing hearts,\r\nand vowed a vow to free their country from oppressors, and restore its\r\nancient liberties. Gradually opening their plans to their kindred and\r\nfriends, they arranged nightly meetings on the Ruetli, a secluded Alpine\r\nmead above the Mytenstein, on Uri lake. Meeting in small bands so as\r\nnot to excite suspicion, they deliberated as to how best their\r\ndeliverance might be effected. On the night of the 17th of November,\r\n1307, Walter Fuerst, Arnold of Melchthal, and Werner Staufacher, met on\r\nthe Ruetli, each taking with him ten intimate associates. Their hearts\r\nswelling with love for their country and hatred against tyranny, these\r\nthree-and-thirty men solemnly pledged their lives for each other and for\r\ntheir fatherland.\r\n\r\nRaising their right hands towards heaven the three leaders took God and\r\nthe saints to witness that their solemn alliance was made in the\r\nspirit--\"One for all, and all for one.\" At that moment the sun shot his\r\nfirst rays across the mountain-tops, kindling in the hearts of these\r\nearnest men the hopes of success.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a very remarkable event had happened at the town of\r\nAltorf in Uri. Gessler had placed a hat on a pole in the market-place,\r\nwith strict orders that passers-by should do it reverence, for he wished\r\nto test their obedience. William Tell scorned this piece of over-bearing\r\ntyranny, and proudly marched past without making obeisance to the hat.\r\nHe was seized, and Gessler riding up, demanded why he had disobeyed the\r\norder. \"From thoughtlessness,\" he replied, \"for if I were witty my name\r\nwere not Tell.\" The governor, in a fury, ordered Tell to shoot an apple\r\nfrom the head of his son, for Gessler knew Tell to be a most skilful\r\narcher, and, moreover, to have fine children. Tell's entreaties that\r\nsome other form of punishment should be substituted, for this were of no\r\navail. Pierced to the heart the archer took two arrows, and, placing\r\none in his quiver, took aim with the other, and cleft the apple. Foiled\r\nin his design, Gessler inquired the meaning of the second arrow. Tell\r\nhesitated, but on being assured that his life would be spared, instantly\r\nreplied, \"Had I injured my child, this second shaft should not have\r\nmissed thy heart.\" \"Good!\" exclaimed the enraged governor, \"I have\r\npromised thee thy life, but I will throw thee into a dungeon where\r\nneither sun nor moon shall shine on thee.\" Tell was chained, and placed\r\nin a barge, his bow and arrow being put at his back. As they rowed\r\ntowards Axenstein, suddenly their arose a fearful storm, and the crew\r\nfearing they would be lost, suggested that Tell, an expert boatman,\r\nshould save them. Gessler had him unbound, and he steered towards\r\nAxenberg, where there was a natural landing-stage formed by a flat\r\nrock--_Tellenplatte_. Seizing his bow and arrows he flung the boat\r\nagainst the rock, and leapt ashore, leaving its occupants to their fate.\r\nWoe betide him, however, should the governor escape death on the lake!\r\nTell hurried on to Schwyz, and thence to the \"hollow way\" near Kusnach,\r\nthrough which Gessler must come if he returned to his castle. Hiding in\r\nthe thicket lining the road, Tell waited, and presently seeing the\r\ntyrant riding past, took aim, and shot him through the heart. Gessler's\r\nlast words were, \"This is Tell's shaft.\"\r\n\r\nThus runs the old story. The question naturally arises, What of all this\r\nis truth, and what fiction? just as it will in the case of Winkelried\r\nand others. The question is easier to ask than to answer, at least in\r\nthe very limited space at our disposal. The truth is, this question has\r\nbeen for half a century the subject of controversy always lively, often\r\npassionate and violent. Some authorities are for making a clean sweep of\r\nall traditional annals, and all semi-mythical national heroes. Others,\r\nno less able and conscientious, and no less learned, have re-admitted\r\ntradition to investigation, and have made it their special care to pick\r\nout the historical grain from the chaff of fiction. It is impossible\r\nwithin the limits of our space to discuss the merits of the numerous\r\nchronicles, and popular songs and plays, in which the traditions of the\r\nTell period are preserved. Suffice it to say, that the \"White Book of\r\nSarnen\" (1470), naive and artless as is its tone, is the most\r\ntrustworthy; that of the \"Swiss Herodotus,\" the patriotic Tschudi\r\n(1570), the most fascinating and most skilfully penned. The work of the\r\nlatter is mainly a series of gleanings from the \"White Book,\" together\r\nwith additional pictures from Tschudi's own pencil. He combined and\r\nsupplied dates and minor details, and cast the whole in a mould\r\napparently so historical that it became an authority for Joh von Mueller,\r\nthe great Swiss historian of the eighteenth century. And the immortal\r\nSchiller deeply stirred by the grand epic, produced his magnificent\r\ndrama, \"William Tell.\"\r\n\r\nIt hardly needs to be said in these days that whilst no one thinks of\r\ntaking these beautiful old-world stories literally, yet few of us would\r\ncare to toss them contemptuously and entirely on one side. Truly they\r\nhave a meaning, if not exactly that which was once accepted. In the\r\npresent instance they represent and illustrate a long epoch during\r\nwhich a high-spirited people were engaged in establishing a\r\nconfederation, and maintaining it against a powerful enemy--one long\r\neffort to secure emancipation from Habsburg tyranny--an epoch which\r\nopened with the acquisition of a charter of liberties for Uri in 1231,\r\nand closed with the brilliant victory of Morgarten in 1315.\r\n\r\nIt remains now to show briefly what may be considered the authentic\r\nhistory of the period, that is, the history as found in authentic\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\nAnd first, it is clearly absurd to suppose that the three Forest Cantons\r\nsprang suddenly into existence as democracies. Feudalism had spread its\r\nnet over the Waldstaetten as elsewhere in Switzerland and Europe\r\ngenerally. But the inborn love of freedom amongst the \"freemen\" of the\r\nthree cantons was intensified by two things, the secluded Alpine life\r\nand the tyranny and aggressiveness of the Habsburgs. The inhabitants of\r\nthe Forest were Alamanni, who, in the seventh century, had moved into\r\nthe higher Alpine regions, the immigration into those regions being\r\ngreatly promoted by a decree of Charlemagne, that whoever should\r\ncultivate land there with his own hands should be the owner thereof. But\r\nbesides these farmer freemen, land was taken up by religious-houses, and\r\nby the secular grandees, who claimed the soil cultivated by their serfs,\r\nbondsmen, and dependants of all kinds. By the bounty of Louis the\r\nGerman, the \"Gotteshausleute\" (God's-house-people), had become of great\r\nimportance in Uri; in 853 that monarch had bestowed his royal lands in\r\nUri, with everything appertaining thereto, on the Abbey of our Lady at\r\nZurich, an abbey founded for his daughters. Beneath the mild rule of\r\nthese royal ladies the inhabitants had acquired great independence, and\r\nhad shared with their mistress the high privilege of the\r\n\"Reichsfreiheit,\" which saved their lands from being mortgaged, or from\r\nfalling under the power of vassal princes. Besides the Lady Abbess,\r\nthere were other proprietors in Uri--the Maison Dieu of Wettingen, the\r\nbarons of Rapperswyl, and other high-born or noble families, and,\r\nlastly, a body of \"freemen.\"\r\n\r\nThis scattered and various society was knit into one close\r\nboundary-association by the possession of the \"Almend,\" a stretch of\r\nland common to all, according to the old German custom--to free and\r\nunfree, rich and poor, noble and serf, who were brought together in\r\ncouncil for deliberation. These assemblies gave rise to the political\r\ngatherings of the \"Landsgemeinde.\"\r\n\r\nNow by a decree of the Emperor Frederick II., Uri was severed from the\r\njurisdiction of Zurich Abbey in 1218, and placed under the control of\r\nHabsburg, who had succeeded to the governorship of Zurichgau, a district\r\nwhich then included the three Forest states. \"Reichsfreiheit\" was lost,\r\nand the inhabitants, fearing their state would fall into the hands of\r\nthe Habsburgs, applied for protection from Henry, son of Frederick II.,\r\nthen at variance with the Habsburg family. He complied with their\r\nrequest, and on the 26th of May, 1231, granted them a charter of\r\nliberties, restored \"Reichsfreiheit,\" and received them into the pale of\r\nthe empire. Uri was now under the direct control of the monarch, and the\r\nlocal authority was vested in an _Ammann_ chosen from the native\r\nfamilies. An imperial representative appeared twice a year in the\r\ncountry to hold his half-yearly sessions, and to collect the imperial\r\ntaxes. When Rudolf of Habsburg rose to the imperial throne, he\r\nrecognized fully the validity of the Uri charter. However a charter was\r\nbut little check on the monarchical tyranny, and we find the country\r\nexasperated by Rudolf's grinding taxation.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Schwyz were no less bold, resolute, and energetic,\r\nthan those of Uri, and no less averse to falling into the hands of the\r\nHabsburgs. Here the freemen predominated, and owned the largest portion\r\nof the country. There is not space to tell of their long quarrel with\r\nthe monks of Einsiedeln respecting some forest lands. Suffice it to say\r\nthat, after a stout stand for their rights, they were ordered to share\r\nthe _corpus delicti_, the forest, with their opponents. During the\r\nquarrels between Rome and the Hohenstaufen, Schwyz staunchly upheld the\r\ncause of Frederick II., but the wavering policy of Rudolf of the junior\r\nline, Habsburg-Laufenburg, was a strong temptation to separate\r\nthemselves from him (1239). They sent letters, messengers, and most\r\nlikely auxiliaries, to Frederick, when he was besieging Faenza with the\r\nview of recovering the Lombard cities, and begged for the protection of\r\nthe empire. Frederick expressed his gratification that the freemen of\r\nSchwyz should voluntarily place themselves under his protection, and\r\nsent them a charter similar to that of Uri (1240)--to \"his faithful\r\nmen\"--by which they obtained the \"Reichsfreiheit,\" and an assurance that\r\nthey should not be severed from the empire.\r\n\r\nA very few years later we hear of the first federal union of which we\r\nhave any certain knowledge. The great quarrel between the emperor and\r\nthe Pope, and the flight of the latter to Lyons, had set Europe on fire.\r\nSchwyz took up arms to defend the founder of its liberties, and entered\r\ninto an alliance with Uri and Unterwalden--and even Lucerne--to throw\r\noff the yoke of the younger Habsburg line. War raged fiercely in the\r\nvalleys of the Forest and by Lake Lucerne, till the Popish party was\r\nbrought to bay, and the overseer driven from the Habsburg castle. We do\r\nnot know the result of this insurrection; it closed no doubt with the\r\ndeath of Rudolf and Frederick in 1249-50.\r\n\r\nIt is to this period of the insurrection doubtless that the stories of\r\nTell, the oath on the Ruetli, &c., apply most clearly. They are\r\nreminiscences probably of some forgotten episodes of the campaigns. Had\r\nthe annalists connected the stories with these times instead of with the\r\nreign of Albrecht, their validity could hardly have been contested.\r\n\r\nWhen Rudolf III. of Habsburg-Austria became emperor, and had bought from\r\nthe younger branch of his house the estates and titles in the\r\nWaldstaetten, he drew Schwyz most closely to his family. He refused to\r\nconfirm Frederick's charter on the plea that that monarch had been\r\nexcommunicated. The magistrates were officers of his own; he gathered\r\nthe taxes in his own name, and, in 1278, assigned them as dowry to the\r\nEnglish bride of his favourite son, Hartmann. Schwyz did not feel\r\ncomfortable under all this, and stood on its guard.\r\n\r\nUnterwalden[26], the lowland district of the Forest, was politically\r\nquite behind the times. It was exceedingly fertile, and was much in\r\nrequest, and in the thirteenth century was parcelled out amongst\r\nreligious-houses, great nobles, and lesser freemen. The Habsburgs being\r\nnot only the greatest proprietors, but also stewards of the\r\nreligious-houses, naturally held sovereign sway. It was only by the aid\r\nof friendly neighbours indeed that Unterwalden could hold its own\r\nagainst such powerful masters, and of all its neighbours the men of\r\nSchwyz were not only the best organized, politically, but the most\r\nenergetic and far-seeing. That the Schwyzers took the lead in the\r\nemancipation of the district is pretty clear from the name that was\r\ngiven to the newly-formed state by surrounding lands, and by the\r\nAustrians after the battle of Morgarten.\r\n\r\nThe death of Rudolf in 1291 was good news to the men of the Forest, and\r\nall their pent-up hopes of the recovery of their ancient rights once\r\nmore burst forth. Yet dreading new dangers from new governors, they took\r\nmeasures of precaution. Within a fortnight of Rudolf's death the three\r\ndistricts of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden had entered into a perpetual\r\nleague or defensive alliance (_Ewiger Bund_), a renewal no doubt of a\r\nprevious pact, probably that of 1246. They may have met on the Ruetli to\r\nswear the solemn oath which was to bind them into a confederation, _a\r\nperpetuite_. The various acts of agreement were drawn up in Latin, and\r\nthe document--the Magna Charta of the Eidgenossenschaft--treasured up at\r\nSchwyz, is held in veneration by the whole Swiss nation. It bears an\r\nessentially conservative character, and witnesses to the thought and\r\nconsideration given to the matter, no less than to the strong sense of\r\nequity and clear judgment of the contracting parties. Amongst other\r\nthings it enjoins that every one shall obey and serve his master\r\naccording to his standing; that no judge shall be appointed who has\r\nbought his office with gold, nor unless he be a native; that if quarrels\r\nshall arise between the Eidgenossen (_inter aliquos conspiratos_), the\r\nmore sensible shall settle the differences, and if the one party does\r\nnot submit, the opposition shall decide in the matter. To the document\r\nwere affixed the seals of the three countries as a guarantee of its\r\nauthenticity.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[26] Unterwalden is parted into two unequal halves by a mountain range\r\nrunning from the Titlis to the Buochser Horn, with the wood of Kerns in\r\nits centre. The districts on both sides have thence taken the names of\r\nOb and Nidwalden, above and below the wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF MORGARTEN.\r\n\r\n(1315.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary object of the Perpetual League was to secure for the three\r\nWaldstaetten that safety which the empire, with its fluctuating fortunes\r\nand condition, failed to ensure. Rich and mighty cities in Germany and\r\nItaly had joined in alliance with similar intent, but whilst these\r\nalliances had come to nought, the simple peasants of the Forest,\r\nhardened by continual struggles, had developed into a power before which\r\neven the Habsburgs were of no avail; for, gifted with striking political\r\nunderstanding and far-sightedness, these born diplomatists knew how to\r\nturn the tide of events to their own advantage.\r\n\r\nAs an additional security, they entered within a few weeks into an\r\nalliance with Zurich and the Anti-Habsburg coalition that had sprung up\r\nin East Switzerland when Adolf of Nassau was chosen successor to King\r\nRudolf in preference to his son Albert, whose absolutism was dreaded by\r\nall. The Zurich forces attacked Winterthur, a Habsburg town, but owing\r\nto the absence of reinforcements sustained a severe defeat (1292).\r\nTaking advantage of their heavy losses, Duke Albert laid siege to the\r\nimperial city of Zurich. Great was his dismay, however, when from his\r\ncamp he saw a formidable force drawn up in battle array on the\r\nLindenhof, an eminence within the city. The armour-bearers, their\r\nhelmets, shields, and lances glittering in the sun, appeared to the foe\r\nto indicate an overwhelming force, and Albert made his peace with the\r\nremarkable city. This was gladly accepted, as well it might be, for it\r\nis said that the dazzling array seen by Albert consisted of the Amazons\r\nof the place, to wit, the women of the town, who had lit on this\r\nstratagem to save their city.\r\n\r\nKing Adolf guaranteed the \"liberties\" of Uri and Schwyz in 1297; but on\r\nhis death in the following year, in battle against his rival, Albert of\r\nHabsburg, these were again at stake--for charters had to be submitted to\r\nthe sovereign's pleasure at every new accession--and in fact were never\r\nacknowledged by the succeeding king. As the object of the Habsburgs was\r\nto join the Waldstaetten to their Austrian possessions, their policy was\r\nnaturally to oppose the freedom of the district. It was a fact highly\r\nfavourable to Swiss interests that the German monarchy was elective; for\r\nthe princes and prince-electors, with their personal and selfish aims,\r\nshut out the mighty Habsburg dynasty, whenever candidates presented\r\nthemselves whom they considered more likely to favour their views. On\r\nsuch grounds Adolf of Nassau was elected, as was also Henry of\r\nLuetzelburg later on.\r\n\r\nAlbrecht was not the cruel, taciturn, tyrant Swiss chroniclers and\r\nhistorians have pictured him. They have, in fact, confounded him with\r\nprevious rulers, chiefly of the junior Habsburg line. Albrecht was bent\r\non the aggrandizement of his house, but, if anything, less selfishly so\r\nthan his father Rudolf III. He was, however, no friend of Swiss\r\nliberties, and, had he lived longer, would doubtless have checked any\r\nefforts on the part of the Swiss to gain greater freedom. But he was cut\r\noff in the very prime of life, by his nephew and ward, John of Swabia,\r\nwho believed himself defrauded of his heritage. With John were other\r\nyoung Swiss nobles--Von Eschenbach, Von Balm, Von Wart, &c.; and by\r\nthese Albrecht was stabbed, within sight of his ancestral manor,\r\nHabsburg, as he was on a journey to meet his queen, Elizabeth. He sank\r\nto the ground, and expired in the lap of a poor woman (1308). The\r\nassassins got clear away, excepting Wart. A terrible vengeance was taken\r\non him, and on the friends and connections of the fugitives, however\r\ninnocent. A thousand victims perished, by order of the bloody Elizabeth.\r\nOn the spot where her husband had fallen the queen built the Monastery\r\nof Koenigsfelden (King's Field), a place which afterwards attained great\r\nfame and splendour. The stained windows of the church still in\r\nexistence, are masterpieces of Swiss work, showing all the exquisite\r\nfinish of the fourteenth century, and testifying to the former\r\nmagnificence of the abbey.\r\n\r\nOnce again the Habsburgs were passed over, and Henry VII. became King of\r\nGermany. To him Unterwalden owes its charter, which placed the three\r\nsmall states on an equal footing politically. However, he died in Italy\r\nwhen going to receive the imperial crown--it is thought by poison. On\r\nhis decease the opposing parties elected two sovereigns, Louis of\r\nBavaria, and Frederick the Handsome, of Austria, son of Albrecht. During\r\na short interregnum, which occurred after the death of Henry VII.,\r\nSchwyz began hostilities against the Abbey of Einsiedeln, of which the\r\nHabsburgs were stewards. This greatly vexed Frederick, and his annoyance\r\nwas increased by finding that the Forest generally sided with his rival.\r\nGoaded beyond bearing, Frederick determined to deal a crushing blow\r\nagainst the rebellious Forest states, and, late in the autumn of 1315,\r\nhostile operations commenced. We are now in our story on the eve of the\r\nfamous battle of Morgarten, which is justly regarded by the Swiss as one\r\nof the noblest of the many noble episodes in their stirring history.\r\nThere is not a civilized nation in the world to which the name of\r\nMorgarten is not familiar.\r\n\r\nBoth parties prepared for war. The Wald Cantons fortified such parts of\r\ntheir district as offered no sufficient security, and placed troops at\r\nthe entrance to the valley. Duke Leopold, a younger brother of the king,\r\na great champion, and eager for combat, undertook the command of the\r\ncampaign, with much dash and self-reliance. He gathered a considerable\r\narmy together on the shortest notice, the Aargau towns, with Lucerne\r\nand Winterthur, and even Zurich, sending troops, whilst the nobility\r\nespoused his cause, and rallied to his standard at Zug. In order to\r\ndivide the forces of the enemy the leader ordered a section of the army,\r\nunder Count Otto of Strassberg, to break into Unterwalden by the Bruenig\r\nPass. Leopold himself commanded the main force, and directed his\r\nprincipal charge against Schwyz, which was particularly obnoxious to\r\nhim. Of the two roads leading from Zug to Schwyz, he chose--probably\r\nfrom ignorance--the one which was the more difficult, and strategically\r\nthe less promising. On the 15th of November, the day before the feast of\r\nSt. Othmar, he brought his cavalry to AEgeri, and thence moved in a\r\nheedless fashion along the eastern bank of that lake, taking no care\r\neither to watch the enemy or to reconnoitre his ground. Amongst his\r\nbaggage was a cartload of ropes, with which he intended to fasten\r\ntogether the cattle he expected to seize. Hurried on by the nobles, and\r\nhimself eager for the fray, he neglected even the most elementary\r\nmeasures of precaution, which, indeed, he deemed quite unnecessary when\r\nmarching against mere peasants. His _cortege_ resembled a hunting party\r\nrather than an army expecting serious warfare. Reaching the hamlet of\r\nHaselmatt, the troops began slowly to ascend the steep and frozen slopes\r\nof Morgarten, in the direction of Schornen. Soon they were hemmed in by\r\nlake and mountain, when, without a moment's warning, there came pouring\r\ndown upon the dense masses of horsemen huge stones, pieces of rock, and\r\ntrunks of trees. Dire confusion followed at once. This unexpected\r\navalanche had been hurled down upon them by a handful of men posted on\r\nthe mountain ridge, and well informed respecting the movement of the\r\nAustrians. Presently the main body of the men from Schwyz and Uri\r\nappeared behind Schornen, and like a whirlwind rushed down the hill on\r\nthe terrified and bewildered foe, who were caught in the narrow pass of\r\nMorgarten, as in a net. It was quite impossible to ward off such an\r\nattack as that. Then the Eidgenossen began to mow down the Austrians\r\nwith their terrible weapon the halberd, an invention of their own.\r\n\r\nA confused scramble and a terrified _melee_ ensued, in which it was at\r\nonce seen that the foe must succumb, utterly disorganized as they were,\r\nand well-nigh helpless through terror. Many in sheer despair rushed into\r\nthe lake. Soon lay scattered over the wintry field the \"flower of\r\nknighthood,\" amongst them the counts of Kyburg and Toggenburg, and other\r\nSwiss nobles. Leopold himself had a narrow escape, and hurried back to\r\nWinterthur, \"looking,\" says Friar John of that place, an eye-witness,\r\n\"like death, and quite distracted.\" Otto of Strassberg, hearing of the\r\ndisaster, retreated with such rapidity that he died overcome by the\r\nphysical efforts he had made. \"Throughout the country the sounds of joy\r\nand glory were changed into wails of lamentation and woe.\" Such was the\r\never-memorable battle of Morgarten. As to the number of men who fell on\r\nthat day, the accounts vary hopelessly, and we do not venture to give\r\nany figures. The infantry probably fled, and had no share in the\r\nencounter.\r\n\r\nSuch was the first proof the young Confederation gave of their mettle\r\nand skill in warfare. The battle has been called the Swiss Thermopylae,\r\nbut it was more fortunate in its results than that of the Greeks. It\r\nconfirmed the national spirit of resistance to the house of Habsburg,\r\nand commenced a whole series of brilliant victories, which for two\r\ncenturies increased the glory, as they improved the military skill of\r\nthe Swiss nation. In humbleness and in a spirit of true devotion, the\r\nvictors fell to thanking God on the battlefield for their rescue, and\r\nthey instituted a day of thanksgiving to be observed as year after year\r\nit should come round.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of December in the same year (1315) the Eidgenossen proceeded\r\nto Brunnen, to renew by oath, and enlarge by some additional paragraphs,\r\nthe treaty or league of 1291, and this for nearly five hundred years\r\nremained the fundamental code of agreement between the three\r\nWaldstaetten. The Forest Cantons, having grown into three independent\r\nrepublics, claimed each separate administration or autonomy. The idea of\r\na federal union thus started by the Forest men gradually grew in favour\r\nwith neighbouring commonwealths struggling for independence; and these,\r\nso attracted, slowly clustered round the Forest Cantons, to form a\r\nbulwark against a common foe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF OLD SWITZERLAND.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\nTHE LEAGUE OF THE EIGHT STATES.\r\n\r\n(1332-68.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOne by one the Swiss lands were reached by the breeze of freedom blowing\r\nfrom the Forest Cantons after the great victory of Morgarten. Yet it was\r\nonly very gradually and in small groups that the other districts entered\r\nwithin the pale of the Eidgenossenschaft. Eight states made up the\r\nnucleus for some time; indeed, till after the Burgundian wars, in 1481,\r\nthey jealously kept out all intruders. In fact, the confederate states\r\nlooked on outsiders merely as \"connections,\" or subjects, and associated\r\nwith them on no other footing. It is a somewhat startling and unusual\r\nthing to find republics ruling over subject lands, yet in this case the\r\nresult was to knit the whole more closely together in after centuries.\r\nIn the fourteenth century the union was of the loosest kind; alliances\r\nwavered, and politics were swayed by separate ends. The other\r\ncommonwealths, in joining themselves with the Forest states, had no\r\nnotion of giving up their individual life, but were wishful to create a\r\nbody powerful enough to secure independence against the aggressions of\r\nAustria; and at the price of continued struggle, and steady perseverance\r\nno less admirable, they achieved that object.\r\n\r\nAttracted by common interests as a near neighbour, and being moreover\r\nthe mart of the Forest Cantons, Lucerne was the first to be drawn into\r\nthe union. This town had acquired great independence under the mild rule\r\nof the famous Murbach Abbey. But in 1291 the convent, having got into\r\nfinancial straits, had sold the town to the Habsburgs. Finding but\r\nlittle liberty under their new rulers, the men of Lucerne formed in 1332\r\nwith the Forest the union of the four Waldstaetten,[27] with the view of\r\nshaking off the Austrian yoke. Lucerne was bound by treaty not to league\r\nherself with outsiders without the consent of the Forest Cantons.\r\n\r\nIn 1351 Zurich followed suit. Her clever and powerful burgomaster, Brun,\r\nwas keenly desirous of raising her to greatness. He was less regardful\r\nof the interests of the Eidgenossen, and indeed had strong leanings\r\ntowards Austria and the empire, as affording a wider scope for ambitious\r\npolitics. Consequently he would not permit her superior position as an\r\nimperial free city, nor her foreign and commercial relations, to be\r\ninjured by submission to the Forest control, and he carried a clause\r\nwhich left her free to join in any other alliances she choose, provided\r\nthat with the Waldstaetten was not broken. He also bound the Forest\r\nstates by treaty, to secure to Zurich its own constitution. The\r\ndocuments connected with this alliance show that the five states formed\r\na power quite ready to cope with Austria. And well for them that they\r\nwere so ready. Louis of Bavaria, the protector of the Forest Cantons,\r\nwas dead, and his successor on the German throne was Charles IV., son of\r\nthe famous blind King of Bohemia, who fell so bravely at Cressy. To\r\nmaintain his authority Charles fell back on the friendship of Austria,\r\nand to win the favour of Albrecht (the \"Wise,\" or \"Lame\"), he nullified\r\nall the measures which Louis had enacted against Austria, measures which\r\nhad destroyed the power of that country in the Waldstaetten. The\r\ndestruction of Rapperswyl[28] (Zurich), and the union between Zurich and\r\nthe other four states were regarded by the Habsburgs as a challenge, and\r\ngave rise to a long-protracted war, marked rather by feats of diplomacy\r\non the part of Austria than by feats of arms. Albrecht was desirous of\r\nhaving a reckoning with the Eidgenossen generally, yet for the present\r\nhe confined his attacks to Zurich, their strongest outpost. The assault\r\nby sixteen thousand men in 1351 was stoutly opposed, and collapsed\r\nsuddenly by proffers of peace. Queen Agnes of Koenigsfelden, the duke's\r\nsister, was called in as umpire, and Brun temporizing with Austria to\r\nsave his town, a verdict was passed so injurious to the people of the\r\nForest, that they refused the mediation of this \"wondrously shrewd and\r\nquick woman,\" who had for these thirty years swayed the Habsburg\r\npolitics, and the quarrel broke out anew.\r\n\r\nThe Zurcher now assumed the offensive, and defeated the Austrians at\r\nTaetwil, being led by Roger Manesse, the grandson of the amateur poet.\r\nThey then marched on Glarus, and conquered that valley in November,\r\n1351. Clarona, like Lucerne, had drifted from beneath the spiritual\r\nrule, and had fallen under that of the Habsburgs, much to her dislike.\r\nAn old chronicler reports that \"the Glarner were well disposed towards\r\nthe Eidgenossen,\" and it is not difficult to believe that they consented\r\nwillingly to be conquered, for in the spring of the next year they\r\nutterly defeated the Austrian forces under Count Stadion, who had\r\nreturned with the intention of recovering the country if possible. The\r\nunion of the Glarner with the Confederates was fixed by a treaty, on\r\nJune 4, 1352, but, curious to relate, they were received as inferiors or\r\n_proteges_ (Schutzort) and not as equals. The Confederates no doubt\r\nreasoned that the acquisition of the valley, with its open villages,\r\noffered no adequate advantages for the extra risks to which it exposed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nZug was the next to be brought into the union. The very situation of\r\nZug, surrounded as it was by the federal territory, rendered it quite\r\nnecessary that that state should be brought into the fold of the\r\nEidgenossen. The country districts surrendered at the approach of the\r\nfederal forces, but the town of Zug offered a stout resistance. However,\r\nthe townsmen heard nothing from Albrecht, much less received any help\r\nfrom him, and yielded on June 27, 1352. Thanks to the greater security\r\nshe offered, Zug was admitted as a full member.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1352, Albrecht renewed his attack on Zurich, with an army\r\ndouble the one first brought against her, Bern, Basel, Strasburg,\r\nSolothurn, and Constance, being bound by treaty, sending troops. But\r\nthis second venture likewise miscarried, after stout opposition and much\r\nwasteful ravaging. This plan of storming an imperial city was unpopular\r\namongst the neighbouring towns, and Eberhard \"the Quarrelsome,\" who held\r\nthe chief command in the place of the lame duke, displeased with the\r\nsecret negotiations, left the camp, and the army was dissolved. Again\r\nthe Austrians resorted to diplomatic machinations, and recovered by the\r\npen what they had failed to keep by the sword. The treaty, or rather\r\ntruce, of Brandenburg, so called from its author, reinstated the\r\nHabsburger in their Forest possessions. Glarus and Zug were compelled to\r\ngive up their union with the Eidgenossen, and, like Lucerne, to return\r\nto the Habsburg rule. Nevertheless, though complying outwardly, the\r\nstates still maintained their friendly _liaisons_. And the league of the\r\nfive states remained intact, and was indeed strengthened by the alliance\r\nof Bern with the Waldstaetten, with which she had been more closely\r\nconnected ever since the great battle of Laupen, where the Forest men\r\nhad proved such staunch and useful friends. The treaty is dated March 6,\r\n1353.\r\n\r\nAlbrecht was dissatisfied with the results of the last truce, and\r\nrenewed the hostilities in the spring of 1353. Prevailing on Charles IV.\r\nto intervene that monarch twice visited Zurich, and held interviews with\r\nher representatives, and those of the Waldstaetten. Yet it was evident\r\nhis purpose was to give every advantage to Austria. The citizens\r\ntrusting that his mediation would be just, received him with \"imposing\r\npomp and great honours.\" But their high hopes were soon dashed.\r\nInfluenced by the Austrian counsellors about him, Charles strongly\r\nupheld the old Habsburg claims, and on his second visit even denied the\r\nvalidity of the ancient charters of the Forest, and requested the\r\nEidgenossen to dissolve their union. Naturally, the Confederates were\r\nunwilling to throw away the results of a century's hard struggling, and,\r\ninsisting on their unchangeable and undeniable rights, they simply\r\nanswered that his \"views were incomprehensible to them.\" Charles at once\r\nreturned to Nuernberg, and thence sent to Zurich his declaration of war.\r\n\r\nAlbrecht, who had bought and rebuilt Rapperswyl, assembled there his\r\nforces, and laid waste the borders of the lake. The king fixed his camp\r\nat Regensberg; and thence the two pushed forward and formed a junction\r\nat Kuesnacht. Their united forces, estimated at fifty thousand, formed\r\nthe most formidable and magnificent army seen that century. Ravaging the\r\nlovely vineyard slopes, laments a contemporary annalist, they marched on\r\nZurich, and, in spite of the sallies of the Zurcher to avert such a\r\nfate, completely encircled the town. Entirely cut off from all supplies,\r\nthe inhabitants had no hope of holding out for any length of time,\r\nespecially against a foe ten times more numerous. But at the most\r\ncritical moment the place was saved by a stratagem. For suddenly the\r\nimperial banner was seen floating over the citadel. The burgesses (or\r\ntheir leader Brun) had hoisted it up as a declaration that they were the\r\nsubjects of the Holy Roman Empire, and meant no disobedience to the\r\nking. The incident made a deep impression on the enemy, and Charles at\r\nonce suspended the siege. Thus for the third time foiled Albrecht\r\nretired in high dudgeon to Baden, and thence began to indulge in mere\r\npetty warfare. As for the king, he betook himself to Prague, there to\r\nenrich the Domkirche with the numerous relics and antiquities he had\r\ndelightedly amassed during his stay in Swiss lands. This king was the\r\nfounder of Bohemia's greatness, and of the splendour of its capital.\r\n\r\nOn his return from Italy as Roman emperor he concluded a peace at\r\nRegensburg, in July, 1355, and the war came to an end. The result, as in\r\nthe case of the previous war, had been injurious to the interests of the\r\nConfederation. Glarus and Zug remained excluded from the League, and the\r\nHabsburgs retained their lands in the Forest. The only thing left was\r\nthe union of the six states. Zurich had borne the burden of the war for\r\nthe last four years, and, unless she wished to forfeit her very\r\nexistence, was compelled to have peace at any price. And as she was\r\ncompletely exhausted, and yet was made the surety for the Waldstaetten,\r\nthe Eidgenossen submitted to the harsh conditions imposed.\r\n\r\nIn 1358 Albrecht died, and was succeeded by his enterprising son, Rudolf\r\nIV. This ruler made it his special object to extend his power on the\r\nUpper Zurich lake. Rapperswyl was fortified and enlarged, and the famous\r\nwooden bridge across the lake was built--not for pilgrims wandering to\r\nEinsiedeln, as common report had it, but--to connect the territories he\r\nhad conquered, or was expecting to conquer. Besides, he wished to cut\r\noff Zurich from the direct route to, and trade with, Italy, and from the\r\nForest. But in 1360 died the all-powerful Brun, who had ever sympathised\r\nwith Austria; and, in 1364, the old Queen Agnes (the widowed queen of\r\nHungary), who had resided for twenty years at Koenigsfelden. Rudolf\r\nlikewise died about the same time, and with their decease the Austrian\r\nspell was broken, and the hold of the Habsburgs on Zurich for a while\r\nloosened. Charles, now unfriendly towards Austria, tried to win favour\r\nwith the Eidgenossen. He heaped privileges on Zurich, and sanctioned the\r\nleague of the six states. Zurich refused to renew the treaty of\r\nRegensburg by oath, and as persistently declined to punish the people of\r\nSchwyz for breaking it. A fresh outbreak of war seemed imminent, but was\r\naverted by the peace of Torberg, 1368, which established a better\r\nagreement between Austria and the Confederation. By this treaty Zug was\r\npermitted to be re-annexed to the league. Zug had been conquered by\r\nSchwyz in 1365, at a moment when the attention of Austria was withdrawn.\r\nGlarus did not return to the Confederation until it had, so to speak,\r\nqualified itself for re-admission, by gaining the most remarkable\r\nvictory of Naefels, the story of which will be told later on.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[27] Compare _Vierwaldstaettersee_, the German for Lake Lucerne.\r\n\r\n[28] See Chapter xiii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\nZURICH AN EXAMPLE OF A SWISS TOWN IN THE MIDDLE AGES.\r\n\r\n(853-1357.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may perhaps do well to pause here awhile before proceeding to show\r\nhow the various Swiss cantons were gathered into the fold of the\r\nEidgenossenschaft--a long process, as a matter of fact--and devote a\r\nshort chapter to a glance at an aristocratic city whose polity and\r\ndevelopment contrast with those of the Forest lands. Zurich presents a\r\nfair example of a city whose origin dates back to a remote age, and\r\nwhose transition from the condition of a feudal territory into the\r\nposition of an independent commonwealth can be clearly followed. That\r\nTuricum is a word of Celtic origin, and that the place was one of the\r\nlake settlements in prehistoric times, and a Roman toll-station later\r\non, has been already shown.\r\n\r\nThe chief founders of this Alamannic, or Swabian, settlement, however,\r\nwere the Carolinger. Louis the German had raised the Grand Abbey and\r\nChurch of Our Lady (Fraumunsterabtei) in 853, to provide his saintly\r\ndaughters, Hildegarde and Bertha, with positions and incomes equal to\r\ntheir rank. His ancestors, Pepin the Short and Charlemagne, had founded\r\nor enlarged the minster, with its vast establishment of prebends, and\r\nthe Carolinum, or clerical colleges. Both institutions were richly\r\nendowed with land, and granted many prerogatives, especially the\r\n_immunity_, most precious of all, viz., the severance from the county or\r\nlocal administration of Zurich. They thus came again under the immediate\r\ncontrol of the empire, and there were developed, two distinct centres of\r\nfeudal life. Yet a third nucleus was formed by the dependants of\r\nroyalty, the _fiscalini_, and followers of the monarch and of the\r\nSwabian dukes. These were grouped around the imperial palace (Pfalz) on\r\nthe Lindenhof, a fortified stronghold on the site of the Roman\r\n_castrum_, and a favourite residence of the German sovereigns, who were\r\nattracted thither by the natural beauty of the place. The houses of the\r\nAlamannic free peasantry were scattered over the slopes of Zurichberg,\r\nand reached down to the Limmat river. Gradually these four distinct\r\nsettlements approached each other, and in the tenth century the inner\r\ncore at the mouth of the lovely lake was girt with strong walls with\r\ntowers, and the _tout ensemble_ now looked like a picturesque mediaeval\r\ncity with its suburbs. The rights of high jurisdiction over the whole\r\nwere exercised by a royal governor, or representative of the sovereign.\r\nThis was the so-called _Reichsvogtei_, or Advocacia in imperio.\r\n\r\nThe noble counts of Lenzburg were imperial governors from about 970 to\r\n1098, but when the Zaerings became the governors of the Swiss lands the\r\nLenzburgs became their holders till their death. Then the\r\n_Reichsvogtei_, that is, the city and its vicinity, fell back into the\r\nhands of the Zaerings, and was held by them directly till the extinction\r\nof the dynasty, 1218. From that time the charge was entrusted to the\r\ncity-board, as Voegte. In Zurich the Lady Abbess acknowledged as her\r\nsuperior none but the governing Zaeringen duke, and later on, that is,\r\nafter the dynasty had come to an end, took the foremost position. Indeed\r\nFrederick and the Hohenstaufer created his _Reichsfuerstin_, Princess\r\nAbbess, and thus the office became one of very special dignity, and was\r\nbestowed generally on ladies of noble birth. By the acquisition of\r\nterritory--reaching into Alsacia and to the St. Gothard--by privileges\r\nacquired under successive monarchs, by monopolies (coinage, fees, and\r\ntolls on markets and fairs, &c.), the institution rose to an eminence\r\nand splendour truly royal. Dukes and counts visited the abbey to pay\r\ncourt to its illustrious abbess--_die Hohe Frau von Zurich_, as she was\r\nstyled--and entrusted their daughters to her care. Yet it was for\r\ncourt-life these high-born damsels were to be prepared rather than for\r\nthe religious vows. The inner life of this great monastery, though\r\nhighly interesting in itself, cannot enter into a short sketch like the\r\npresent. Not only was the Abbess Lady Paramount over her clergy and vast\r\nabbatial household, with its staff of officers and its law-court, but\r\nshe also bore sway over the city itself. When the administration began\r\nto require increased attention she enlarged its council, and presided at\r\nits meetings. This curious state of things continued till the thirteenth\r\ncentury, which saw the rise of a general political emancipation in\r\nGerman cities. Though apparently under a thraldom, yet the citizens\r\nreally grew beneath the mild and equitable female rule into a powerful\r\nand thriving body, and at length began to contest with their mistress\r\nfor self-rule.\r\n\r\nTo Frederick II. they owed their emancipation. By him Zurich became a\r\nfree imperial city, governed by its own council. Council and citizens\r\ngradually becoming alive to their own civic interests, step by step\r\nwrested the civil power from the hands of the Lady Abbess, and emerged\r\ninto the condition of an independent commonwealth. By this time society\r\nwithin the city had arranged itself into three distinct classes. (1) The\r\nclergy, headed by the abbess and the provost. (2) The knights, owing\r\nmilitary service to emperor and abbess, and the burghers, or chiefly\r\nfree landowners, and important commercial men. This second order was the\r\ngoverning class, and out of it came the members of the council. (3) The\r\ncraftsmen, who exercised their trades only with the permission of their\r\nmasters, the governing class. The workers were excluded from all share\r\nin the government, and were even prohibited from forming guilds. The\r\nmajority of the artisans and serfs lived without the gates, in the outer\r\ncity or walled-in suburbs. These political inequalities at length met\r\nwith violent opposition, and in 1336 there broke out a revolution.\r\n\r\nThe industry of the thrifty and energetic population increased the\r\nmaterial wealth of the city, and commercial treaties were entered into\r\nwith neighbouring countries, with Italy particularly, and Italian\r\ninfluence made itself felt ever since the twelfth century, through four\r\nhundred years, not only in trade, but also in architecture. Zurich\r\nbecame an emporium for silk, and the silk manufacture, introduced from\r\nItaly, became a speciality, and was found in no other German town.[29]\r\nThe activity displayed in building churches and monasteries was simply\r\nastonishing. The present minster, in the Lombard style, on the type of\r\nSan Michele at Pavia, was built in the twelfth century, and the abbey\r\nwas restored by the noble ladies in the thirteenth. The frequent visits\r\nof kings and emperors, who held their diets here, naturally increased\r\nthe importance of the city. Taking it altogether, Zurich must have been,\r\neven in the thirteenth century, a fine specimen of a mediaeval town, for\r\nBarbarossa's biographer, Otto von Freysing, calls it the noblest city of\r\nSwabia (\"Turegum nobilissimum Sueviae oppidum\").[30] Her policy of\r\nentering into alliances with the Swabian and Rhenish towns, and with the\r\nvast South-German coalition, and the friendly political and commercial\r\nrelations she maintained, show that she fully grasped the situation,\r\nand gave her that security which promoted her trade and industry, and\r\nallowed her to develop freely.\r\n\r\nThe thirteenth century spread enlightenment amongst the benighted people\r\nof the Middle Ages, and increased the growth of political freedom in the\r\ncities, thanks to the struggles between the Papacy and the Hohenstaufen.\r\nZurich had early emancipated herself from the spiritual sway and\r\ninfluence of her abbess mistress. Already, in 1146, the people had\r\nlistened with keen interest to the advanced religious teaching of Arnold\r\nof Brescia, and in the ensuing quarrels sided with the freethinking\r\nFrederick II. During the interdict of 1247-49 Frederick's staunch\r\nadherents boldly drove from the town those clergy who refused to perform\r\ntheir spiritual functions. On a second expulsion from the town the\r\nfriars took sides with the citizens, and obeyed the order literally, for\r\nthey went out by one gate of the town, and re-entered by another, and\r\nresumed their offices. That the Zurcher had grown strong and\r\nself-reliant is shown by their alliance with Rudolf of Habsburg, in the\r\nfeuds against their common foes, the neighbouring nobles, whose raids\r\nthey checked, and by openly resisting the heavy taxation imposed by the\r\nmonarch on the city. On one occasion--it was at a drinking-bout--the\r\nchief magistrate denounced this oppressive policy most wrathfully in the\r\nvery presence of the queen and her daughters.\r\n\r\nThe Staufen epoch, seething with social and political movements, was\r\nalso full of the spirit of romanticism. The English and French met the\r\nGermans in the Crusades, and quickened in the Fatherland the love of\r\npoetry and romance. Then the great religious wars themselves opened out\r\na whole new world of thought and fancy. The glorification of the\r\nbrilliant exploits of the Staufen sovereigns, themselves poets, inspired\r\nmany a grand or lovely song, the highest flights producing the\r\nNibelungen and the _Minnelieder_. In Swiss lands also minstrelsy flowed\r\nrichly, and Zurich stands out as a \"Poets' Corner\" in the thirteenth\r\ncentury. At the hospitable manor of Roger Manesse, a famous knight and\r\nmagistrate of the city, or at the great Abbey Hall, a brilliant company\r\nof singers clustered round the Princess Abbess Elizabeth, an eminent\r\nwoman, and her relatives, the Prince Bishop of Constance, Henry of\r\nKlingenberg, and his brother Albrecht, the famous chevalier. Then the\r\nPrince Abbots of Einsiedeln, and the abbots of Petershausen (Constance),\r\nthe counts of Toggenburg, the barons of Regensberg, of Eschenbach, and\r\nVon Wart, together with many other lords, spiritual and temporal, and\r\nmany a fair and illustrious lady--all these thronged the courtly circle\r\nto listen to the recital of the _Minnelieder_, or perchance to produce\r\ntheir own. The famous Codex Manesse, lately at Paris, and now in\r\nGermany,[31] bears witness to the romantic character of the age. It\r\ncontains the songs of some hundred and fifty German and Swiss minstrels,\r\nwho sang between the years 1200 and 1350. Manesse and his son, a canon\r\nat the minster, undertook the collection out of pure enthusiasm. Their\r\namanuensis was a comely young fellow named Hadloub, the son of a\r\nfreeman farmer from the Zurichberg. A pretty story is told how during\r\nhis mechanical labour of copying there grew strong in him the love of\r\npoetry, and he became himself a poet. For he fell in love with a\r\nhigh-born lady at Manesse's court, who however noticed him not. Then he\r\ntold his grief in love songs which Manesse added to his collection.\r\nIndeed these songs close the series of Swiss poems in the Codex Manesse.\r\nGottfried Keller, of Zurich, one of the greatest German novelists of the\r\npresent day, has treated of the period in his exquisite novel \"Hadloub\"\r\n(_Zurcher Novellen_). Space does not permit us to give any account of\r\nthe story, and the reader must be referred to the fascinating tale as it\r\nstands. Hadloub was indeed the last Swiss minstrel belonging to that\r\nfertile age. The love and beauty of woman is the theme of his songs, and\r\nin depicting these he particularly excels--the real _Minnegesang_.\r\nUhland, the great lyric poet says of him, \"In the clear soul of this\r\npoet the parting minstrelsy has once more reflected its own lovely\r\nimage.\"\r\n\r\nBut whilst poetry was rejoicing the hearts of the nobles, political\r\nclouds were fast gathering over the city, to break at length into a wild\r\nhurricane. As a matter of fact, a few distinguished families had\r\nestablished an oligarchy in the place of the city council in process of\r\ntime. The craftsmen, excluded from any share in the administration, and\r\nmoreover finding fault with the financial management of the state, and\r\ngalled by the domineering conduct of the aristocracy, rose in fierce\r\nopposition. Rudolf Brun, an ambitious ruler, but a clever statesman,\r\nbeing at variance with his own patrician party, suddenly placed himself\r\nat the head of the malcontents. Overthrowing the government before it\r\nhad time to bestir itself, Rudolf had himself elected burgomaster, an\r\nofficial in whom all power was to centre. In 1336 he presented a new\r\nconstitution, making the whole assembly swear to it. To insure its\r\nvalidity this code (_Geschworne Brief_) was submitted to the sanction of\r\nthe abbess and the provost, and was also approved by the emperor. This\r\nnew constitution was quite in keeping with the political views of the\r\nage, and remained in its chief points the leading constitutional guide\r\nof the commonwealth down to the revolution of 1798. It was a curious\r\nblending of democratic with aristocratic and monarchical elements. The\r\ncraftsmen, who up to the present had counted for nothing in politics,\r\nwere now formed into thirteen corporations, each selecting its own\r\nguildmaster, who represented its members in the governing council. The\r\nnobility and the wealthy burghers who practised no profession, or the\r\nGeschlechter (patricians), and rentiers formed a highly aristocratic\r\nbody known as the Constafel (Constables), and were likewise represented\r\nin the state council by thirteen members, six of whom Brun named\r\nhimself. The position of the burgomaster was the most striking of all,\r\nand was, in fact, that of a Roman dictator of old, or resembling the\r\nItalian tyrannies of the Visconti or Medici. Elected for life, vested\r\nwith absolute power, the burgomaster was responsible to none, whilst to\r\nhim fealty was to be sworn by all on pain of losing the rights of\r\ncitizenship. The idol of the people to whom he had granted political\r\npower, Brun was regarded as the true pilot and saviour in stormy times.\r\nThe fallen councillors brooded revenge, and being banished the town,\r\nresorted to Rapperswyl, the Zurich _extra muros_, and at the other end\r\nof the lake. There they made _chose commune_ with Count John of that\r\nplace, who was desirous of evading payment of the debts he had\r\ncontracted in Zurich. Feuds and encounters followed, and John was slain\r\nin battle in 1337. The emperor tried to restore peace, but the exiled\r\ncouncillors were bent on bringing back the old state of things, and on\r\nregaining their seats. They plotted against Brun's life, and those of\r\nhis associates, and fixed upon the 23rd of February, 1350, for making an\r\nattack by night on the city, with the intention of seizing it by a\r\nsingle _coup-de-main_. They relied on the help of sympathisers within\r\nthe town. The burgomaster, being apprized of the plot, summoned his\r\nfaithful burghers to arms by the ringing of the tocsin. A bloody\r\nhand-to-hand fight in the streets took place, thence called the _Zurcher\r\nMordnacht_. The conspiracy was crushed by the majority, and Count John\r\nof Rapperswyl, son of the above-mentioned count, was thrown into the\r\ntower of Wellenberg, a famous state prison. There he passed his time in\r\nthe composition of _Minnelieder_.\r\n\r\nBrun made a bad use of his victory. His cruelties to the prisoners and\r\nto Rapperswyl, which he burnt, are unjustifiable, and seem inexplicable\r\nin so far-sighted a statesman. He was ambitious, and desired not only\r\nhis own advancement, but also that of his native city. He had depended\r\non Austria, hoping to rise through her alliance and aid, but, suddenly\r\nforgetting all moderation, and disregarding all traditional _liaisons_\r\nwith her, he laid waste the territory of the counts of Rapperswyl,\r\ncousins to the Habsburgs. This of course entangled Zurich in a war with\r\nAustria, who threatened to level her with the ground. Having estranged\r\nthe neighbouring states by her cruel proceedings, or rather by those of\r\nBrun, Zurich stood alone, and was compelled to look around for aid and\r\ncountenance. Though by no means friendly towards the bold Forest men,\r\nthe dictator Brun concluded an alliance with them. The Waldstaetten were\r\nquite ready to receive into their league a commonwealth so powerful and\r\nwell-organized as Zurich, a state likely to be at once their bulwark and\r\ntheir emporium. They therefore willingly agreed to Brun's stipulations\r\n(May 1, 1351), and, further acquiesced in the proviso that Zurich should\r\nbe allowed to conclude separate treaties. These treaties or alliances\r\nwere very common at that time, and changeable as they were, they\r\nnevertheless gave additional security for the time being.\r\n\r\nBut though Brun had introduced a _regime_ of force, he yet made\r\nconcessions to the masses, giving them a share of political power. And\r\nhis constitutional system answered the wants of the city, to a great\r\ndegree, for some four centuries and a half.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] White silk veils in the guise of bonnets were exported to Vienna,\r\nand even as far as Poland. This silk-making, of course, increased the\r\nprosperity of the town. It declined, and was reintroduced in the\r\nsixteenth century in a far more advanced condition, by the persecuted\r\nProtestants from Locarno.\r\n\r\n[30] He also reports that one of its gates bore the inscription,\r\n\"_Nobile Turegum multarum copia rerum_.\"\r\n\r\n[31] It happened to be in the possession of the Elector of the\r\nPalatinate, and was carried off to France when Louis XIV. laid waste the\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nBERN CRUSHES THE NOBILITY: GREAT VICTORY OF LAUPEN, 1339.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe alliance of Bern was a great acquisition to the federal league. She\r\nformed the corner-stone of the Burgundian states, and brought them into\r\nconnection with, and finally into the pale of, the Swiss Confederation.\r\nHer early history has been touched upon in previous chapters. True to\r\nher original position as a check on the nobility, and forming a natural\r\nstronghold, this proud Zaeringen town shows a singularly martial, and\r\nindeed dominant spirit, and runs a military and political career of\r\nimportance. Bern had effectively resisted the encroachments of the old\r\nhouse of Kyburg (1243-55), and stoutly opposed the oppressive tax of 40\r\nper cent, imposed by Rudolf of Habsburg. And, though she had suffered a\r\nsevere defeat at Schosshalde, in 1289, the disaster was more than\r\ncompensated by a great victory at Dornbuehl, in 1298, and she had carried\r\nover her rival, Freiburg and the nobles of the highlands, partners of\r\nthe latter. It was always a most usual thing in the fourteenth century\r\nfor states to enter into leagues, with the view of better safeguarding\r\nthemselves against neighbouring and powerful foes. And thus Bern\r\ngathered all the kindred elements of West Switzerland into a Burgundian\r\nConfederation--the free imperial valley Hasle, the rich monastery of\r\nInterlaken, the house of Savoy, the new house of Kyburg-Burgdorf, the\r\nbishops of Sion, the cities of Bienne, Solothurn, Freiburg,--all these\r\nwere at one time or another in union with Bern. The friendship with\r\nFreiburg, however, was often disturbed by feelings of jealousy that at\r\ntimes grew into feuds, but that for Solothurn was lasting. It was, in\r\nfact, based on similarity of political views and aims, both agreeing in\r\nrefusing to acknowledge the rival kings, Louis of Bavaria and Frederick\r\nthe Handsome. In consequence of their obstinacy, Leopold, who had been\r\ndefeated at Morgarten, and wished to reassert the authority of his\r\nbrother, laid siege to Solothurn in 1318. The Bernese came to the help\r\nof the sister city. A memorable scene was witnessed during the course of\r\nthe assault. The river Aare was much swollen at the time, and a bridge\r\nthat the beleaguering forces had thrown across was carried away by the\r\nflood, and their men were being drowned in numbers. Then the\r\nSolothurner, forgetting all injuries, rushed out with boats to save\r\ntheir enemies. Leopold was so touched by such magnanimity that he at\r\nonce raised the siege, and presented the town with a beautiful banner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STANDARD-BEARERS OF SCHWYZ, URI, UNTERWALDEN AND\r\nZUeRICH.]\r\n\r\nBern's strong bent for territorial extension was quite a match for the\r\nencroaching tendencies of the Habsburgs. To get a footing in the canton\r\nthe latter made use of a crime committed amongst the Kyburger. That\r\nillustrious house, well-nigh ruined morally and financially, had been\r\ncompelled by its adverse fortunes to place in the Church a younger son,\r\nEberhard. The young man submitted with great reluctance. Happening to\r\nfall to a quarrel with Hartmann, at the castle of Thun, high words arose\r\nand were succeeded by blows, and Hartmann was slain. This was in 1332.\r\nOn the plea of avenging the murder, the Habsburgs set up a claim to the\r\nKyburg property. Bern however confirmed the count in his possessions,\r\nand purchasing Thun from him, returned it as a fief, requiring him to\r\ngive an undertaking that Burgdorf should never be mortgaged without her\r\nknowledge and consent. But Eberhard gradually forgot the services Bern\r\nhad rendered his house, and, fearing her power, veered round to\r\nFreiburg, and became a citizen of that town. The differences then\r\nswelled into an outbreak, which had been for some time impending. Bern,\r\nit is to be noted, had in many ways got the start of the sister city;\r\nfor instance, she had become an imperial free city in the year 1218, on\r\nthe extinction of the Zaeringer, and this had given her a considerable\r\nlift. Then, in 1324, Bern had secured the mortgage of Laupen, an\r\nexcellent stronghold on the Saane, and had driven the Freiburger from\r\nthe district. And in 1331, after the house of Kyburg had joined its\r\nfortunes with those of Freiburg, the strong fortress of Guemminen had\r\nbeen demolished, as well as many Kyburg castles. Guemminen belonged to\r\nher rival, and was a place of singular strategical importance.\r\n\r\nBut these were mere preliminary episodes, and more serious warfare\r\nfollowed. Many of the surrounding nobles had outlived their time of\r\nprosperity and greatness, and yet clung to the prerogatives of their\r\nclass without possessing any longer the means to maintain them. Bern\r\ntook advantage of all this to secure her own aggrandisement, and gain\r\nfor herself more territory, for originally she had possessed no lands\r\nbeyond her walls. The Bernese Oberland was the first district on which\r\nshe set her eyes. Here the counts of Greyerz,[32] the dynasts of Turn\r\n(Valisian nobles), and the barons of Weipenburg, held the chief\r\nterritorial lordships, and formed a strong Alpine coalition with\r\nAustrian sympathies, as against the rising city of Bern. With the last\r\nmentioned Bern strove for the supremacy, and stormed their stronghold,\r\nWimmis, in the Simmenthal, both town and castle, and demolished the\r\n_Letzinen_,[33] or fortifications in the valley. The old baron and his\r\nnephew had no means to fight out the quarrel, and were compelled to\r\naccept the terms dictated by the victors. They were bound to render\r\nmilitary service, and were required to pledge their castles for their\r\nsubmission, and so forth. But what most nearly touched them was the loss\r\nof Hasle. That beautiful valley, stretching from Brienz lake to the\r\nGrimsel pass, with romantic Meiringen as its central place, has had a\r\nstrange history. The inhabitants were at first free Alamannic farmers,\r\nowing allegiance to no sovereign, or lord, except the German monarch,\r\nand they chose their Ammann from amongst themselves, or had him chosen\r\nby the king. They had allied themselves as equals with Bern, in 1275,\r\nbut in 1310 their subjection was sealed. Henry VII. wanting money for\r\nhis coronation at Rome, mortgaged Hasle to the barons of Weipenburg, for\r\n340 marks. In 1334 Bern bought up the mortgage, and the valley thus came\r\nunder Bernese rule. Bern now appeared likely enough to stretch her power\r\neven up to the snow-clad mountain lands, and laid the foundation of her\r\nfuture pre-eminence amongst the western cantons. But she stirred up\r\nfierce opposition, especially on the part of the Burgundian nobles.\r\nFearing for their very existence, the counts of Greyerz, Valangin,\r\nAarberg, Nidan, Neuchatel, Vaud, Kyburg, headed by Freiburg, encouraged,\r\nthough not actually assisted, by Louis of Bavaria, rose in arms. Bern\r\ncalled for help from Hasle, Weipenburg, and the Forest Cantons, but\r\nfound it a difficult matter to get together the scattered forces. On the\r\n10th of June, 1339, an army of fifteen thousand foot and three thousand\r\nhorse marched against Laupen, whose defence devolved upon some four\r\nhundred Bernese. On the 21st of the same month there arrived at the town\r\nthe forces of the Eidgenossen, amounting to barely six thousand men.\r\nThey wore a white cross of cloth, and marched to the relief of the\r\nbeleaguered city animated by the stirring words of Theobald, a priest of\r\nthe Teutonic order. The battle actually took place, however, on a\r\nplateau a little more than two miles east of the town. During the day\r\nthe besiegers had amused themselves with various sports, mocking the\r\npreparations of their opponents, and it was not till vespers that Count\r\nValangin commenced hostilities. It was a desperate struggle that\r\nfollowed--a second Morgarten. The Waldstaetter had begged to be allowed\r\nto engage the cavalry, and a hard task they found it. Yet within two\r\nhours the enemy was completely routed, and took to flight. No fewer than\r\nfifteen hundred men lay dead upon the field, and amongst them the counts\r\nof Valangin, Greyerz, Nidan, the last count of Vaud, and others. Seventy\r\nfull suits of armour, and twenty-seven banners had been taken. Their\r\nhearts overflowing with joy and thankfulness the victors sank on their\r\nknees at nightfall, when all was over, and thanked God for His mercy. It\r\nwould be uninteresting to a foreign reader to give an account of the\r\ndiscussions which have taken place as to the leadership of the Bernese\r\nforce. But it may be mentioned that two distinguished generals, Rudolf\r\nvon Erlach and Hans von Bubenberg, have by different authorities been\r\ncredited with the honour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORCH OF BERN MINSTER, WITH STATUE OF RUDOLF VON\r\nERLACH.]\r\n\r\nThe war was not yet concluded, but degenerated into one of simple\r\ndevastation. The Freiburg forces were defeated at the very gates of\r\ntheir town by Rudolf von Erlach, according to some records, which would\r\nseem to show at any rate that he is no mere fictitious personage. Bern\r\nadded victory to victory, and the saying ran that, \"God Himself had\r\nturned citizen of that town to fight for her just cause.\" In July, 1340,\r\na truce was agreed upon, and Bern resumed her old alliances with Kyburg,\r\nthe Forest, Vaud, and even Geneva. The diplomatic Lady of Koenigsfelden,\r\nAgnes, anxious to secure so staunch an ally, drew Bern into a league\r\nwith Austria, which lasted for ten years, and strongly influenced the\r\npolitics of the town. It was not till after the expiration of this\r\nleague, and after the peace of Brandenburg, that she could enter into an\r\nalliance with the league of the seven states. This closed the list of\r\nthe eight Orte, and the league proved to be perpetual. Though Bern was a\r\ngreat check on the feudal nobility, she yet herself possessed a\r\nthoroughly aristocratic form of government, in which the lesser people\r\nand craftsmen had no share whatever.\r\n\r\nThe mad schemes of Rudolf of Kyburg, who hoped to mend his fortunes by\r\nconquering Solothurn and other towns, gave rise to protracted warfare,\r\nin which Burgdorf and Thun fell to the share of Bern, by purchase, in\r\n1384. To dwell on this is impossible, within the limits of our space,\r\nbut it may be mentioned that a first siege proved a failure. Retaliation\r\nwas made by the siege of Burgdorf, which likewise miscarried, through\r\nthe intervention of Leopold. The doom of the house of Kyburg was,\r\nhowever, sealed, and it fell beneath the sway of Bern. The treachery of\r\nthe Habsburgs in breaking their promise to the Eidgenossen was one of\r\nthe chief causes leading to the battle of Sempach, the most famous of\r\nall Swiss battles.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[32] Von Greyerz still occurs amongst the Bernese aristocracy.\r\n\r\n[33] Letzinen are walls constructed across a valley, and are peculiar to\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLES OF SEMPACH, 1386, AND NAEFELS, 1388.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeldom, if ever, has Switzerland seen a more eventful month than that of\r\nJuly, 1386, for in that month she fought and won the ever-memorable\r\nbattle of Sempach. To set down all the petty details as to the causes\r\nwhich led to this engagement would be tedious indeed. It is sufficient\r\nto point out--what is but a truism--that there is seldom much love lost\r\nbetween oppressor and oppressed, and Austria and the Swiss Confederation\r\nhad for some time held that relation to each other. A ten years' peace\r\nhad indeed been concluded between the two powers, but it was a sham\r\npeace, and the interval had been used by both to prepare for new\r\nconflicts.\r\n\r\nAustria was secretly assisting the impoverished house of Kyburg in her\r\nravishing expeditions against the towns of the Confederation.\r\nRuthlessness was met by ruthlessness; Zurich laid siege to Rapperswyl\r\nwith the intent to destroy the odious Austrian toll-house; Lucerne\r\nlevelled with the ground the Austrian fort Rothenburg, and entered into\r\nalliances with Entlebuch and Sempach to overthrow the Austrian\r\nsupremacy. This was equal to a declaration of war, and war was indeed\r\nimminent.\r\n\r\nDuke Leopold III., of Austria, was most anxious to bring the quarrel to\r\nan issue, and to chastise the insolent Swiss citizens and peasantry. The\r\nSwiss cities had joined in league with the Southern German towns, which\r\nlike themselves professed the policy of resisting the encroaching\r\ntendencies of princes and nobles. Mutual help in case of need had been\r\npledged amongst themselves by this league of cities, but the burghers of\r\nthe German towns were mere puppets in the hand of Austria. She, dreading\r\nthe rising of wealthy towns, cajoled them by fine promises, and they\r\npleaded for submission, and sought to compose the differences between\r\nthe Swiss and the Austrians. Of very different mettle, however, were the\r\ntowns on this side the Rhine; they objected to the weak and wavering\r\npolicy of their more northerly neighbours, and determined on fighting,\r\nif necessary, alone and unaided.\r\n\r\nLeopold III., a descendant of that Leopold so disastrously defeated at\r\nMorgarten, possessed most of the virtues held of account in his day. He\r\nwas manly, chivalrous, dauntless; he was possessed of dexterity and\r\nadroitness in both sports and the more serious business of war. His\r\nindomitable spirit and personal daring knew no bounds. He had once, clad\r\nin full armour, forded the Rhine at flood-time, and in the sight of the\r\nenemy, to escape being made prisoner. Like Rudolf of Habsburg he was\r\nvastly ambitious, and bent on securing wealth and greatness for the\r\nhouse of Austria. A clever manager of his estates and a generous master,\r\nhe was yet neither politician nor tactician; as a man of action, and\r\nfilled with hatred of the refractory towns, he spared no pains to check\r\ntheir struggles for independence. No wonder then that the nobles of\r\nSouthern Germany rallied round the gallant swordsman, and made him their\r\nleader in the expeditions against the _bourgeoisie_ and peasantry. And\r\nno sooner had the truce expired (June, 1386), than they directed their\r\nfirst attack on the bold Confederation; no fewer than one hundred and\r\nfifty nobles sending letters of refusal (= a challenge) to the summons\r\nto war sent out by the Swiss Government.\r\n\r\nLeopold's plan was to make Lucerne the centre of his military\r\noperations, but in order to draw away attention from his real object, he\r\nsent a division of five thousand men to Zurich to simulate an attack on\r\nthat town. Whilst the unsuspecting Confederates lay idle within the\r\nwalls of Zurich, he gathered reinforcements from Burgundy, Swabia, and\r\nthe Austro-Helvetian Cantons, the total force being variously estimated\r\nat from twelve thousand to twenty-four thousand men. He marched his army\r\nin the direction of Lucerne, but by a round-about way, and seized upon\r\nWillisan, which he set on fire, intending to punish Sempach _en passant_\r\nfor her desertion. But the Confederates getting knowledge of his\r\nstratagem left Zurich to defend herself, and struck straight across the\r\ncountry in pursuit of the enemy. Climbing the heights of Sempach on the\r\nside of Hiltisrieden, overlooking the town and lake of that name, they\r\nencamped at Meyersholz, a wood fringing the hilltop. The Austrians\r\nleaving Sursee, for want of some more practicable road towards Sempach,\r\nmade their way slowly and painfully along the path which leads from\r\nSursee to the heights, and then turns suddenly down upon Sempach. Great\r\nwas their surprise and consternation when at the junction of the Sursee\r\nand Hiltisrieden roads they came suddenly upon the Swiss force, which\r\nthey had imagined to be idling away the time at Zurich. The steep\r\nhillsides crossed by brooks and hedges looked a battlefield\r\nimpracticable enough for cavalry evolutions, yet the young nobles in\r\nhigh glee at the prospect of winning their spurs in such a spot pleaded\r\nfor the place against the better reason of all men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Swiss, confident of success, and trusting in the help of God and the\r\nsaints, as of old, drew up in battle order, their force taking a kind of\r\nwedge-shaped mass [Drawing of trapezoid] the shorter edge foremost\r\nand the bravest men occupying the front positions. The Austrians, on the\r\nother hand, relying proudly on the superiority of their high-born\r\nknights and nobles, looked disdainfully on what they believed to be a\r\nmere rabble of herdsmen. And, in truth, the handful of fifteen hundred\r\nmen, inadequately armed with short weapons or clubs, battle-axes or\r\nhalberds, seemed but a sorry match for that steel-clad army of six\r\nthousand well-trained lancers, cavalry, and foot. But the possession of\r\ncavalry in such a spot could not in itself give any advantage to the\r\nAustrians, and their knights dismounted and handed their horses to the\r\ncare of attendants. To avoid getting their feet entangled in the long\r\ngrass of a meadow close by the noble cavaliers cut off the beaks or\r\npoints of their shoes--then the fashion--and the spot is to this day\r\ncalled the \"beak-meadow\" (Schnabelweide). Claiming for themselves the\r\nright to win honour that day, they ordered their infantry to the rear.\r\nAccording to another account, however their infantry were still at\r\nSursee, the noble horsemen declining their aid. After ancient custom,\r\nthe Austrians formed themselves into a compact phalanx, the noblest\r\noccupying the front ranks, the preparations being necessarily hurriedly\r\nand somewhat indefinitely made.\r\n\r\nThe onset was furious, and the Austrian Hotspurs, each eager to outstrip\r\nhis fellows in the race for honour, rushed on the Swiss, drove them back\r\na little, and then tried to encompass them and crush them in their\r\nmidst. The Swiss quickly fell back, but some sixty of their men were cut\r\ndown before the Austrians lost a single soldier. The banner of Lucerne\r\nwas captured; the Austrian phalanx was as yet unbroken, and all the\r\nfortune of the battle seemed against the Swiss, for their short weapons\r\ncould not reach a foe guarded by long lances. But suddenly the scene\r\nchanged. \"A good and pious man,\" says the old chronicler, deeply\r\nmortified by the misfortune of his country, stepped forward from the\r\nranks of the Swiss--_Arnold von Winkelried_! Shouting to his comrades\r\nin arms, \"I will cut a road for you; take care of my wife and children!\"\r\nhe dashed on the enemy, and, catching hold of as many spears as his arms\r\ncould encompass, he bore them to the ground with the whole weight of his\r\nbody. His comrades rushed over his corpse, burst through the gap made in\r\nthe Austrian ranks, and began a fierce hand-to-hand encounter. Fearful\r\nhavoc was made by the Swiss clubs and battle-axes in the wavering ranks\r\nof the panic-stricken enemy, whose heavy armour and long lances indeed\r\ngreatly impeded their movements. Nevertheless the Austrians made a brave\r\nstand, and Leopold, who had been watching the issue, now rushed into the\r\n_melee_, and fell one of the bravest in the desperate struggle. The\r\nnobles and knights, calling for their horses, found that the attendants\r\nhad fled with them. Seeing that all was lost, the knights became\r\npanic-stricken, and rushed hither and thither in the greatest disorder.\r\nThere still remained the infantry, however, and these attempted to stay\r\nthe flight of the hapless cavaliers, and restore order, but it was all\r\nin vain. A fearful carnage followed, in which no mercy was shown, and\r\nthere fell of the common soldiers two thousand men, and no fewer than\r\nseven hundred of the nobility. The Swiss lost but one hundred and twenty\r\nmen. Rich spoils--arms, jewellery, and eighteen banners--fell into the\r\nhands of the victors.\r\n\r\nThis defeat of a brilliant army of horse and foot, of knights and\r\nnoblemen, all well-trained, by a mere handful of irregulars--citizen and\r\npeasant soldiers--was a brilliant military achievement, and attracted\r\nthe attention and admiration of the civilized world. It brought to the\r\nfront the _bourgeoisie_ and peasantry and their interests, and struck\r\nterror into the hearts of their oppressors. This great victory gained by\r\nthe Swiss not only widened and established more firmly the career of\r\nmilitary glory commenced at Morgarten, but it gave to the Confederation\r\nindependence, and far greater military and political eminence. What\r\nPlataea had been of old to the Greeks, that Sempach was to the Swiss; it\r\nstruck a deadly blow against an ancient and relentless foe. Austria, her\r\nrule on this side of the Rhine thus rudely shaken, was compelled to\r\nwaive all rights of supremacy over the Confederation. Not that she\r\nrelinquished those rights readily; it needed an equal disaster to her\r\nforces at Naefels, in 1388, before she would really and avowedly\r\nrenounce her pretensions to rule the Swiss.\r\n\r\nThe story of Winkelried's heroic action has given rise to much fruitless\r\nbut interesting discussion. The truth of the tale, in fact, can neither\r\nbe confirmed nor denied, in the absence of any sufficient proof. But\r\nWinkelried is no _myth_, whatever may be the case with the other great\r\nSwiss hero, Tell. There is proof that a family of the name of Winkelried\r\nlived at Unterwalden at the time of the battle. But no Swiss annals\r\nreferring to the encounter at Sempach were written till nearly a century\r\nlater. The Austrian chronicle gives no account of Winkelried's exploit,\r\nand for good reason, say the Swiss: all the men of the Austrian front\r\nranks, who alone could have witnessed the exploit, were killed, and the\r\nrear ranks fled at the very first signs of disaster in front of them. A\r\nfifteenth-century chronicle of Zurich, and the numerous songs and annals\r\nof the sixteenth century, are full of praise of Winkelried and his\r\ndeeds. But whatever may be the real truth of the matter it is certain\r\nthat the grand old story of Winkelried and his splendid self-sacrifice\r\nis indelibly written on grateful Swiss hearts. Whether it was a single\r\nman or a whole body of men that offered up life itself for their\r\ncountry, it clearly proves a dauntless spirit of independence, a hatred\r\nof wrong and tyranny to have been innate in the breasts of the old\r\nSwitzers, and to have led to the deliverance of their country from\r\nforeign oppression. And in spite of the many and often bitter\r\ncontroversies of the past twenty years the memory of Winkelried will\r\never remain an inspiration and a rallying-point whenever the little\r\nfatherland and its liberties are threatened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Winkelried's monument at Stanz (_From photograph by\r\nAppenzeller, Zurich._)]\r\n\r\nThe victory of Naefels forms a worthy pendant to that of Sempach, and as\r\nsuch cannot be passed over in silence. The Austrians, having recovered\r\ntheir spirits after the terrible disaster, and the \"foul peace\" (_faule\r\nFriede_) hastily arranged having expired, they carried the game to its\r\nconclusion. Despite all prohibitions, Glarus had kept up its friendship\r\nwith the Eidgenossen, and in conjunction with them had, in 1386,\r\ncaptured Wesen, the key to the district. To Glarus, therefore, Albrecht\r\nIII. now gave his whole attention. But Glarus itself, feeling much more\r\nfree after Sempach, assembled its inhabitants, in the spring of 1387,\r\nfor the first time as a Landsgemeinde, and drew up for itself a\r\nconstitution. Wesen on Walensee was recaptured by the Austrians on\r\ntheir way to Glarus. This happened through the treachery of the\r\ninhabitants of the town, who, siding with their old masters, opened\r\ntheir gates. The federal garrison was surprised as they slept, and put\r\nto the sword (February, 1388). The Austrians assembled at Wesen a force\r\nof six thousand horse and foot, and on the 9th of April set out in two\r\ndivisions. Count Hans von Werdenberg, the chief mover in the enterprise,\r\nclimbed the opposite heights, with the intention of forming a junction\r\nat Mollis, whilst Count Donat von Toggenburg and other nobles led the\r\nmain force along the river Lint. Reaching Naefels, at the entrance of\r\nthe Glarus valley they found their passage barred by an Alpine\r\nfortification--a _Letzi_, as it is called--consisting of rampart and\r\nditch. This, however, was stormed without difficulty, as the guard was\r\ninsufficient for its defence. In truth, the Glarner were unaware of the\r\nAustrian movements, and though Ambuehl and his two hundred men fought\r\nwith the utmost bravery, they were no match for the far superior numbers\r\nagainst them. Like a torrent the Austrians rushed into the open and\r\ndefenceless valley, and, fancying no doubt there was no further\r\nopposition or danger to fear, dispersed in all directions, pillaging\r\nproperty, firing houses, driving cattle. Plunder and destruction seemed\r\nindeed to be now their sole aim; but meanwhile the tocsin was sounding\r\nthrough the valley to call the villagers to arms in defence of their\r\ncountry. Fast they flocked to the standard of Ambuehl, who had posted\r\nhimself with his troops on the steep declivity of Rautiberg, waving\r\nhigh the banner of St. Fridolin to attract his friends. Here, six\r\nhundred men all told, including a handful of men from Schwyz, awaited\r\nthe foe. At last, in straggling and disorderly fashion, the Austrians\r\nappeared in sight, many lingering behind for the sake of plunder. Their\r\nattempt to ascend the eminence occupied by the foe was met by a shower\r\nof stones, which threw the horses into confusion. With true Alpine\r\nagility the mountaineers now dashed down the slopes and fell on the\r\ncavalry. A fierce encounter followed, and then a terrible chase, during\r\nwhich the Austrians are said to have ten times stopped in their flight\r\nand attempted to hurl back their Swiss pursuers, but ten times were\r\ncompelled to give way again before the terrible strokes which met them.\r\nDarkness set in, and with it came on fog, and a sudden fall of snow. A\r\nsuperstitious panic seized on the Austrians, and they fled in the utmost\r\nconfusion to Naefels, and thence sought to regain their faithful Wesen.\r\nBut here a fresh catastrophe awaited them. Thronging the bridge spanning\r\nthe outlet of the lake their weight broke down the structure, and\r\nhundreds of fugitives dragged down by their heavy armour sank with it,\r\nand were drowned. Count Werdenburg, who was watching the disaster from\r\nhis eminence, fled as fast as he could. This disaster explains the loss\r\nby the Austrians of so disproportionate a number of men, viz., seventeen\r\nhundred, as against the fifty-four who fell of the Glarus force. The\r\nlatter fell chiefly in defence of the Letzi.\r\n\r\nYear after year the people of Glarus, rich and poor alike, Protestant\r\nand Catholic, still commemorate this great victory. On the first\r\nThursday in April, in solemn procession, they revisit the battlefield,\r\nand on the spot the Landammann tells the fine old story of their\r\ndeliverance from foreign rule, whilst priest and minister offer\r\nthanksgiving. The 5th of April, 1888, was a memorable date in the annals\r\nof the canton, being the five-hundredth anniversary of the day on which\r\nthe people achieved freedom. From all parts of Switzerland people\r\nflocked to Naefels to participate in the patriotic and religious\r\nceremonies. A right stirring scene it was when the Landammann presented\r\nto the vast assembly the banner of St. Fridolin--the same which Ambuehl\r\nhad raised high--and thousands of voices joined in the national anthem,\r\n_Rufst du mein Vaterland_, which, by the way, has the same melody as\r\n_God save the Queen_. If the Switzer has no monarch to love and revere,\r\nhe has still his national heroes and his glorious ancestors, who sealed\r\nthe freedom of their country with their blood.\r\n\r\nIn 1389 a seven years' peace was arranged, and Glarus returned to the\r\nConfederation. This peace was first prolonged for twenty years, and\r\nafterwards, in 1412, for fifty years. Finally, after a strife of more\r\nthan one hundred years, Austria renounced her claims to rule over the\r\nForest, and all her rights in Zug, Lucerne, and Glarus. In process of\r\ntime the various dues were paid off in ordinary form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\nHOW SWITZERLAND CAME TO HAVE SUBJECT LANDS.\r\n\r\n(1400-1450.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth century the Eidgenossen established a _menage\r\npolitique_ of their own, and fixed its independence; in the fifteenth\r\nthey raised it to power and eminence, and obtained for it an important\r\nmilitary position in Europe. Yet though their family hearth was\r\nestablished, all was not done. The allied states could not stop there.\r\nThey were still surrounded by lands ruled by Austria, by Italy, by\r\nSavoy; lands which could and did threaten the independence of the little\r\ninfant republic. In fact, at a very early stage, the acquisition of\r\nadditional territory became a vital question. This was to be done by\r\nmeans of new alliances, or by purchase or conquest. Zurich, for\r\ninstance, had already, between 1358 and 1408, spent some two million\r\nfrancs in the buying of land. The struggles for independence had kindled\r\na like desire for emancipation amongst the neighbouring Alpine states.\r\nBut the efforts resulting were not all equally successful. Some of the\r\nstates drifted from monarchical subjection to that of the federation or\r\ncanton as subject lands (_Unterthanen laender_); others became\r\n\"connections\" (_Zugewandte_), or allies of inferior rank; others, again,\r\ntook the position of _Schirmverwandte_, or _proteges_. One might indeed\r\ngo thus through a whole graduated scale of relationships developed\r\namongst the crowd of candidates seeking admission into the league. And\r\nthough as yet kept outside they received a helping hand from the\r\nEidgenossen. But it is not till the opening of the nineteenth century\r\nthat we find the list of twenty-two cantons made up. Thanks to the\r\nmediation of Napoleon Bonaparte (1803), St. Gall, Thurgau, Grisons,\r\nAargau, Vaud, and Ticino were added to the confederation of states. And\r\nby the Congress of Vienna, in 1814-15, were also added Valais, Geneva,\r\nand Neuchatel. The latter, however, still continued under the sway of\r\nPrussia, although partly a free state, till 1857. The reader will\r\nclearly see into what a complicated fabric of unions the league is\r\ngrowing, and that the Swiss fatherland did not spring at once into life\r\nas a _fait accompli_. Each canton had its separate birth to freedom, as\r\nwas the case with the free states of ancient Greece, which joined into\r\nconfederations for a similar end--protection against a common foe. Each\r\nlittle state has its own separate history, even before it amalgamates\r\nwith the general league. We shall, however, notice only the leading\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nAppenzell opens the series of _Zugewandte_, or \"connections.\" The\r\nshepherds and peasants scattered around the foot of Mount Saentis,\r\noppressed by the abbots of St. Gall, began a rising that partook of a\r\nrevolutionary character. A succession of heroic feats followed--the\r\nbattle of Vogelinseck in 1403, that of Am Stoss in 1405, and\r\nothers[34]--and the prelate and his ally, Frederick IV. of Austria\r\n(\"Empty Pocket\"), were completely defeated. Somewhat curiously we find\r\nGraf Rudolf von Werdenberg throwing in his lot with that of the humble\r\npeasants, and stooping to the humiliating terms they insisted upon. He\r\nhad been robbed of his lands by the Habsburgs, and hoped to recover them\r\nby the help of the Alpestrians, and actually did so. But the peasantry\r\nwere somewhat diffident concerning him, and would not entrust him with\r\ncommand. So the noble knight of St. George put aside his fine armour and\r\nhis magnificent horse, and donned the peasant's garb to be admitted into\r\ntheir ranks. Elated by their succession of triumphs the hardy\r\nAppenzeller rushed on to new victories. Bursting their bounds, like an\r\nimpetuous mountain torrent, they spread into neighbouring lands, and\r\neven penetrated to the distant Tyrol. Serf and bondsman hailed them as\r\ndeliverers, and whole towns and valleys along the Upper Rhine and the\r\nInn came into alliance with them--_Bund ob dem See_, above Lake\r\nConstance--that was to be a safeguard in the East. At last the Swabian\r\nknighthood plucked up courage enough to oppose this mountain hurricane.\r\nAt the siege of Bregenz in 1407, they were, through carelessness, put\r\nto flight. The Bund collapsed, and its prestige departed, but the men\r\nhad secured their object, viz., independence from control by the Abbey\r\nof St. Gall. By and by they bought off some of the taxes, and they met\r\nat their Landsgemeinde to consult respecting the weal of their country.\r\nDown to our own days this institution remains famous. Their application\r\nin 1411 for admission into the league was granted, but quite\r\nconditionally. Bern kept aloof from them, and Zurich found it necessary\r\nto checkmate their revolutionary tendencies, and they were received as\r\n_Zugewandte_, or allies of second rank. It was not till 1513 that the\r\nnew-comer rose to the position of full member of the league. St. Gall,\r\ntoo, became \"a connection\"--and no more--in 1412.\r\n\r\nThe emancipation of the Valais (Wallis) is but one succession of feuds\r\nbetween the native nobility and Savoy, the owner of Low Valais, on the\r\none hand, and the bishops of Sion and the people, on the other. It was,\r\nin fact, a contest between the Romance and the German populations, the\r\nlatter of whom the French had driven into a corner. The dynasts Von Turn\r\nhad Bishop Tavelli seized in his castle and hurled from its very windows\r\ndown a precipice. This foul murder was avenged in the great battle of\r\nVisp, where Savoy is said to have left four thousand dead (1388). The\r\nbarons of Raron sustained a defeat at Ulrichen, in 1414, though assisted\r\nby Bern (of which town they were citizens) and Savoy. These powerful\r\nnobles left the country, and the Valisians gradually secured autonomy,\r\nand, being helped in their quarrels by the Forest men, they finally drew\r\nnearer to the Confederation, as _Zugewandte_ (1488).\r\n\r\nWe must not pass over a singular custom which prevailed amongst the\r\nValais folk. It was a custom observed as a preliminary to serious\r\nwarfare. If a tyrant was to fall, he was attainted and doomed by the\r\nMazze. This was a huge club on which was carved a distressed-looking\r\nface as a symbol of oppression, the club being wound round with bramble.\r\nIt was carried from village to village, and hamlet to hamlet, even to\r\nthe remotest spots, and set up at public places to attract the attention\r\nof the people. One of the malcontents would then step forward and\r\ndenounce the oppressor to the figure, and promise help. It was said that\r\nwhen the name of Raron was pronounced the figure bowed deeply in token\r\nof assent, and the insurgents drove nails into the face as a declaration\r\nof hostility, and the instrument was deposited at the gate of the\r\nbaron's castle.\r\n\r\nGraubuenden (Grisons), the land of ancient and mediaeval memories, of\r\ncrumbling and picturesque castles, was, on account of its rugged surface\r\nand its almost countless dales, split up into numberless territorial\r\nlordships. Here in this rocky seclusion held sway the Belmonts, the\r\nMontforts, the Aspermonts, the Sax-Misox, and many others whose sonorous\r\nnames tell of their origin. Here also were found the families of\r\nHaldenstein, Werdenberg, Toggenburg, and many more--Italian, Romansch,\r\nand German mingling closely. Yet the lord-paramount of them all was the\r\nBishop of Chur, who had attained the rank of _Reichsfuerst_ or duke, who\r\nhad a suite of nobles attached to his quasi-royal household, and who\r\nheld lands even in Italy. Quite contrary to the usual rule, noble and\r\npeasant in general lived amicably together. The political freedom of the\r\nstate was due rather to remarkable coalitions than to acts of war or\r\ninsurrection. In the fourteenth century, when the bishops of Chur\r\nrevealed a strong leaning towards Austria-Tyrol, the Gotteshausbund\r\nsprang into existence as a check on the alien tendencies of the\r\nprince-bishops. This league was formed in 1367 by the _Domstift_\r\n(chapter of clergy), the nobles, and the common people. The bishops\r\nthemselves ruled over people of three different nationalities. A glance\r\nat the place-names on the map of Buenden shows how the old Latin race\r\n(Romansch), the Italians, and the migrated German race, were mixed up\r\npell-mell in the district. Yet the Walchen Romansch (Welsh) were slowly\r\nretreating before the Valser, or Germans of the Valais, who had a strong\r\nbent for colonization and culture. In 1397 the _Graue Bund_ (Grey\r\nLeague) was started in the valleys of the Vorder-Rhine by the Abbot of\r\nDisentis, some of the nobles, and the people at large. On the death of\r\nthe last of the Toggenburgs in 1436 his various domains of Malans,\r\nDavos, Praettigau, &c., dreading Austrian interference, united into a\r\nleague known as the ten _Gerichte Bund_ (Jurisdictions), so called\r\nbecause each of the districts had its own place of execution. Gradually\r\nthe three leagues formed a federal union (1471), and held their diets at\r\none centre, Vazerol. Thus Buenden, developing after the manner of the\r\nForest Cantons, grew into a triple and yet federal democracy which,\r\nthreatened by the Austrian invasion during the Swabian wars, turned to\r\nthe Eidgenossen for help, and joined with them in 1497 as \"connections.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1414 met the famous Council convoked by the Emperor Sigismund to\r\nremedy the evils which galled the Church, that Council which by a\r\nstrange irony of fate sentenced to death by fire John Huss, the staunch\r\nopponent of the very abuses which the Council was called to redress. The\r\nCouncil proved fatal to the Habsburg interests in Swiss lands. Frederick\r\nIV. of Austria--the enemy of Appenzell--refused his homage to the German\r\nmonarch, and for material reasons espoused the cause of John XXIII., one\r\nof the three deposed popes. John gave a tournament to cover his\r\ndeparture, and during the spectacle fled in a shabby postillion's dress\r\nto the Austrian town, Schaffhausen, whither Frederick followed.\r\nExcommunicated and outlawed--within a few days no fewer than four\r\nhundred nobles sent challenges to him--Duke Friedel, as he was\r\nfamiliarly called by his faithful Tyrolese peasantry, who alone stood by\r\nhim, was driven from his lands and from his people. On all sides German\r\ncontingents fell upon his provinces. Sigismund called on the Eidgenossen\r\nin the name of the empire to march on Aargau, his ancestral land,\r\npromising them the province for themselves. As they had just renewed\r\ntheir peace with Austria, the Eidgenossen were unwilling to break it,\r\nbut it was urged by the emperor that their promise to Frederick was not\r\nbinding. Bern, ever bent on self-aggrandisement, and determined to\r\nsecure the lion's share if possible, threw away her scruples, and within\r\nseventeen days took as many towns and castles.[35] Zurich, consulting\r\nwith the Eidgenossen, followed suit and seized Knonau. Lucerne took some\r\nfragment, and the Forest did likewise. Aargau, the retreat of the\r\nHabsburg nobles, offered no serious resistance; but Baden, which was\r\nseized by the Eidgenossen conjointly, the castle of Stein, the royal\r\nresidence of the Habsburgs, was being stormed, when Sigismund tried to\r\nstop the siege; for Frederick in despair had in the meantime made an\r\nabject submission, and most of the confiscated lands were restored to\r\nhim. However, the Eidgenossen were unwilling, because of the emperor's\r\nwavering policy, to relinquish so good a chance of adding to their\r\nterritory. Matters were settled by their paying over a sum of money to\r\nSigismund, who was ever in financial straits. Henceforth Friedel was\r\nnicknamed \"With-the-empty-pocket.\"[36] Aargau was divided amongst the\r\nEidgenossen as subject land, what they had seized separately becoming\r\ncantonal, and what conjointly federal, property. Baden and some other\r\nplaces became federal domains _(gemeine Herrschaften)_, over which each\r\nof the eight states in turn set a governor for two years. With this\r\nprecedent we enter upon the curious period in which the Swiss cantons\r\nsplit into two sets, the governing and the governed.\r\n\r\nWhilst the republics vied with each other in extending their borders,\r\ntwo, Uri and Unterwalden, were unable to increase their territory, being\r\nhemmed in by lofty mountains. They turned their eyes towards the sunny\r\nsouth, beyond St. Gothard, where they might find additional lands. Like\r\nthe Rhaetians of old they had often descended into the Lombard plains,\r\nthough for far more peaceful ends. When the St. Gothard pass was thrown\r\nopen in the thirteenth century, there was a lively interchange of\r\ntraffic between the two peoples--the cismontanes and the transmontanes.\r\nThe men of the Forest sold their cheese, butter, cattle, and other\r\nAlpine produce at the marts in the Lombardian towns, and got from thence\r\ntheir supply of corn and other necessaries. And they of the Forest acted\r\nas guides across the mountains, as they did down to the railway era.\r\nTheir youths, too, enlisted amongst the Italians soldiers, induced\r\neither by the prospect of gaining a living, or by a mere desire for\r\namusement. Thus the Swiss associated on friendly terms with the\r\nsoutherners. But all this pleasant social intercourse was suddenly cut\r\noff. Whilst the Eidgenossen under the aegis of a weakened empire secured\r\nindependence, the mighty Lombard cities, which had objected to imperial\r\nfetters, however light, by a singular contrast sank beneath the\r\ntyrannies of ambitious native dynasts, and under the Visconti the duchy\r\nof Milan sprang up from these free Italian towns. Quarrels that broke\r\nout between the Milanese and the people of the Forest prepared the way\r\nfor the acquisition of Ticino by the Swiss. In 1403 Uri and Unterwalden\r\nwere robbed of their herds of cattle at the mart of Varese by the\r\nofficials of the Visconti, on what pretext is not clear. Failing to get\r\nredress, they at once decided on resorting to force. They seized the\r\nLivinenthal or Leventina, which willingly accepted the new masters.\r\nFresh robberies in 1410 were revenged by the annexation of the\r\nEschenthal, with Domo d'Ossola, which greatly preferred Swiss supremacy\r\nto that of the Duke of Milan. This is not much to be wondered at, seeing\r\nthat Gian Maria Visconti was a second Nero for cruelty. The human beings\r\nwho fell victims to his suspicion or revenge he had torn to pieces by\r\nhuge dogs, which were fed on human blood. To strengthen their Italian\r\nacquisitions the Eidgenossen bought Bellinzona (1418) from the barons of\r\nSax-Misox or Misocco of Graubuenden. But the Milanese dukes would not\r\nbrook the loss of these lands, and a long-protracted war ensued with\r\nvarying success. Most of the more distant cantons being opposed to these\r\nItalian conquests declined to send help, but hearing that Bellinzona had\r\nbeen captured by the Visconti, some three thousand Eidgenossen marched\r\nto its relief in 1422. They were, however, no match for the twenty-four\r\nthousand troops gathered by the famous general Carmagnola. Lying in\r\nambush for the Swiss he succeeded in completely shutting them in at\r\nArbedo, with the exception of six hundred who had escaped into the\r\nvalley of Misox. For six hours the small Swiss band fought to the\r\nutmost, refusing to give way, though opposed by a force of ten times\r\ntheir number, and well trained. Suddenly their brethren came to their\r\nrelief, or they would have been crushed. The Swiss loss was two hundred,\r\nthat of the enemy nine hundred. But the conquests were forfeited for\r\nthe present. Yet the Swiss pushed on to new war to redeem their\r\nmisfortunes under the Sforza. A brilliant victory was that of Giornico\r\n(Leventina), 1478, where six hundred Swiss under Theiling from Lucerne\r\ndefeated a force of fifteen thousand Milanese soldiers. This tended\r\ngreatly to spread Swiss military fame in Italy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARMS OF URI.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[34] It is related that Uli Rotach kept at bay with his halbert twelve\r\nAustrians, giving way only when the hut against which he leant was set\r\non fire.\r\n\r\n[35] To Bern fell the classic spots Habsburg and Koenigsfelden.\r\n\r\n[36] As a retort to those who thus nicknamed him this extravagant prince\r\nbuilt a balcony at Innsbruck whose roof was covered with gold, at the\r\ncost of thirty thousand florins--it would be twenty times more money\r\nnow. Every visitor to that romantic city will be struck by the quaint\r\n_Haus zum goldenen Dachere_ (House with the golden roof).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\nWAR BETWEEN ZURICH AND SCHWYZ.\r\n\r\n(1436-1450.)\r\n\r\n\r\nA gloomy picture in Swiss history do these civil wars present, marking\r\nas they do the chasm separating the Confederates, who were each swayed\r\nby a spirit of jealous antagonism. Yet it was clear that the town and\r\nthe country commonwealths--citizens and peasants--formed such strong\r\ncontrasts that they would not always pull together. Indeed, the\r\nsmouldering discontent was suddenly fanned into flame by questions\r\nrespecting hereditary succession that threatened to consume the whole\r\nConfederation. Feudalism was tottering to its fall in Switzerland, but\r\nit seemed as if the famous counts of Toggenburg were for a while to stay\r\nits ruin in the eastern portion of the country. Frederick III.\r\n(1400-1436) possessed what would come up to the present canton of St.\r\nGall, the Ten Gerichte, a large portion of Graubuenden, Voralberg (which\r\nhe had wrenched from Friedel \"of the Empty Pocket\"), and other\r\ndistricts. Despite the popular struggles for freedom he managed to\r\nmaintain his authority by adroit and designing policy and by alliance\r\nwith Zurich and Schwyz, which stood by him against foes domestic and\r\nforeign. Having no children Frederick promised that on his death the two\r\ncantons should receive his domains south of Zurich lake, which\r\nacquisition would round off their territory. He died in 1436, but left\r\nno will--intentionally, as was thought by some, with the view of\r\nentangling the Confederates in quarrels--\"tying their tails together,\"\r\nas the expressive but not very polished phrase had it. Be that as it\r\nmay, the apple of discord was soon in the midst, and there set up as\r\nclaimants numerous seigneurs of Graubuenden, barons from the Valais, near\r\nrelatives, as well as Austria and the empire. Zurich and Schwyz also\r\ncontended for the promised stretch of land. To penetrate into the maze\r\nof petty conflicts which followed would be ridiculous as it would be\r\nimpossible. In accordance with her more aristocratic inclinations Zurich\r\npaid court to the dowager countess whilst Schwyz humoured rather the\r\nsubjects as the future masters, and the three latter proved in the end\r\nto have had the better judgment. The strife, indeed, fell into one of\r\nemulation between the two most energetic and talented statesmen of the\r\ntwo commonwealths. One of these leading men was burgomaster Stuessi, of\r\nZurich, and the other was Ital von Reding, from Schwyz, both highly\r\ngifted and energetic men. Even from their youth they had been rivals,\r\nincited by the Emperor Sigismund whose favour they enjoyed.\r\n\r\nSave the battle of St. Jacques on the Birse, the war brought forth no\r\ngreat military exploits, and as it effected no material changes it may\r\nbe very briefly passed over. It splits naturally into three periods. The\r\nfirst of these (1436-1442) is simply a series of wasteful feuds waged by\r\nthe Confederates alone. Schwyz had taken for itself the whole heritage\r\nin question, with the exception of one fragmentary portion left to its\r\nrival. Zurich, thus deprived of her portion, and disappointed in her\r\nscheme of planning a direct commercial road to Italy through Graubuenden,\r\nretaliated by shutting her market against Schwyz and Glarus, causing a\r\nfamine in the two districts. The Confederates did not act with\r\nimpartiality in the matter, but, laying all blame on Zurich, drove her\r\nto arms. She was, however, again a loser, for her territory to the east\r\nof the lake, which was the theatre of war, was terribly wasted. This\r\nportion of the land Schwyz wished to annex, but was prevented by order\r\nof the federal Diet. Nevertheless Zurich lost to Schwyz and Glarus three\r\nvillages on the upper lake, and the island Ufenau which she had governed\r\nfor half a century, and she was compelled to re-open her roads and\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nDeeply wounded by the position of the Confederates in the opposition\r\nranks, and still more by the humiliation inflicted on her by the rustics\r\nof Schwyz, the proud, free city of Zurich thirsted for revenge. Thus the\r\nsecond period of conflict began, and in June, 1442, Zurich sought a\r\nforeign alliance. Stuessi, or his secretary, who was his right hand,\r\ntaking advantage of her old leanings towards Austria, conceived the\r\nMachiavelian plan of joining in union with the deadly foe of the\r\nConfederates. Despite the firm opposition of a strong party of noble and\r\neminent patriots, the coalition was arranged. The plea was put forward\r\nthat the \"imperial city,\" by virtue of her exceptional position, and the\r\ntreaty concluded under the auspices of Brun, in 1351, was allowed to\r\nmake any alliances she chose. Disloyalty was thus coloured by a show of\r\ntruth. The Emperor Frederick III. and his brother, Albrecht of Austria,\r\nproceeded to Zurich to receive the homage and allegiance of the\r\nenthusiastic population. The Confederates guessing the meaning of this\r\nmove tried to convince the renegade member of her perfidy. But their\r\nefforts failing, all, Bern included--though she took no prominent or\r\nactive part, being chiefly occupied by her Burgundian politics--sent\r\ntheir challenge to Austria and Zurich. The war, though fiercer and\r\nbloodier than the first, was just as luckless, owing to dissensions\r\narising amongst the allies, the men of Zurich being unwilling to submit\r\nto a many-headed Austrian lordship. The struggle was carried on by fits\r\nand starts, the Confederates returning home on one occasion for the\r\nannual haymaking. Having laid waste the Zurich territory the\r\nConfederates proceeded to attack the capital itself. During a sally to\r\nSt. Jacques on the Sihl, Stuessi fell in defence of the bridge over that\r\nriver, whilst endeavouring to keep back the foe and stay the flight of\r\nthe fugitives. His heroic death makes one almost forget his ambitious\r\nand misguided policy. At last the Zurich forces drew up their guns on\r\nthe Lindenhof, an eminence within the town. A single ball worked\r\nwonders, for, piercing the walls of a barn, it upset the table at which\r\nwere sitting a party of Glarner, and carried off the head of the topmost\r\nman at the table. Greatly impressed by this result the besiegers rushed\r\nfrom the premises, stopped the siege, and began negotiations for a\r\ntruce. But the Austrians objected to the truce, fearing a reconciliation\r\nbetween Zurich and the Confederates, and they incited the mob to make a\r\nset against the patriotic councillors who were believed to be the prime\r\nmovers in the peace negotiations. A state of terrorism set in, five of\r\nthe leading men were demanded by the populace, and were publicly\r\nbeheaded; and ten more suffered the same fate. Thus powerless had Zurich\r\ngrown in the hands of Austria. The truce being thus prevented the\r\nEidgenossen proceeded to besiege Greifensee, a strong fortress in the\r\nZurich midlands. For four weeks the garrison of eighty men held out,\r\nbut, being at last betrayed by a peasant, were compelled to surrender at\r\ndiscretion. Sentence of death was passed on the brave defenders by a\r\nmajority of the Confederates, and the cruel sentence was carried out in\r\na meadow at hand. Ital von Reding stood by to see that the imperial\r\ncustom of passing over every tenth man should not be followed in this\r\ncase. However when sixty had fallen he turned away, and the rest were\r\nspared. Strange stories attach to that bloody spot, and indeed Nemesis\r\nsoon avenged the cruel deed. A second siege of the capital was\r\nundertaken by the Confederates, but proved a failure like the first. The\r\nmen of Zurich, in fact, made light of the siege, and a band of young men\r\neven sallied forth and captured wine and other provisions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: St. Jacques Monument, Basel, by Schloeth. (_From\r\nPhotograph by Appenzeller, Zurich._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arms of Schwyz.]\r\n\r\nWishful to bring matters to an issue, Austria turned to France for\r\nassistance, well knowing that she herself was no match for the\r\nEidgenossen in open field. She was, besides, tired of the profitless and\r\nresultless kind of war which had hitherto been carried on. Charles VII.\r\nwas anxious to get rid of his mercenary troops, the savage Armagnacs,\r\nwhich he had led against England, and was glad to launch them on Swiss\r\nlands. This combination of Austrian and French arms--the Zurcher\r\nremained at home to defend their still beleaguered city--introduces the\r\nthird and last portion of the war. The Dauphin (Louis XI.), with an army\r\nof thirty thousand men, marched against Basel, and the Eidgenossen,\r\nunacquainted with the numbers of the enemy, set out to meet them. When\r\nthey came within sight of the foe, they crossed the river Birse in the\r\nmost exuberant spirits. Soon, however, they were split into two\r\ndivisions by the heavy fire of the French, and one of these being\r\nsurrounded on an island in the river was completely annihilated by the\r\noverwhelming numbers, though fighting with marvellous bravery. The other\r\ndivision took up a position behind the garden walls of the infirmary of\r\nSt. Jacques, on the river (August 26, 1444). Here for six hours a small\r\nbody of some five or six hundred men held their ground. Twice they\r\nwithstood the assault of a foe twenty or thirty times their number, and\r\ntwice themselves rushed on in attack. But at last the walls gave way,\r\npierced through and through, and the foe rushed through the breach. A\r\nhand-to-hand fight followed, till the hospital being fired the Swiss\r\nwere compelled to succumb. Yet, though failing, each man died a hero.\r\nSome drew arrows from their wounds, and hurled them at the enemy; others\r\nwho had lost one hand swung their halberts with the other. The\r\nArmagnacs, who had fought in many a bloody battle, confessed that never\r\nbefore had they met with a foe so dauntless, so regardless of death. The\r\nAustrians, however, denied the Swiss such testimony. On the day\r\nfollowing the battle a German knight was riding over the field wading in\r\nblood, and boasted to his comrades, \"To-day we seem to be bathing in\r\nroses.\" \"There, eat thy roses!\" yelled a dying Uri soldier, flinging at\r\nhis head a large stone which struck him dead from his horse. Louis, who\r\nhad lost some four thousand men in the fight, was greatly impressed by\r\nsuch show of bravery on the part of the Swiss, and concluded an\r\nhonourable peace with them at Ensisheim, on the 28th of October, 1444.\r\nSt. Jacques is a second Swiss Thermopylae, and sheds immortal honour on\r\nthe combatants. Though beaten the Confederates were not dishonoured.\r\nLike the brave Spartans under Leonidas they preferred death to servitude\r\nand dishonour. This battle was also the turning-point of the federal\r\nwar; it rendered the Confederates more pliant. And though desultory\r\nfeuds still showed themselves, peace was at last concluded, in 1450, by\r\nwhich Zurich was forced to give up her Austrian alliance. The federal\r\nleague was knit more closely together than ever before; old injuries\r\nwere soon forgotten, and the Eidgenossen accepted an invitation to\r\nZurich to join in the carnival festivities got up to celebrate the\r\nreconciliation, 1454. A deplorable incident took place during the\r\nfestivities, the seizure by the Eidgenossen, at the minster, of the\r\nfamous savant, Felix Malleolus, a canon of the Church. Born of an\r\nancient family at Zurich, he was educated first at the Carolinum in his\r\nnative city, and afterwards at the university of Bologna, which was the\r\nglory of the Middle Ages. Bold, and of an unbending will, early\r\nacquainted with the corruptions of the Church and clergy, he hurled\r\nbitter invectives against the guilty, and raised for himself a host of\r\nenemies amongst the priesthood. And during the early years of the war he\r\nhad likewise attacked the Eidgenossen as enemies of his native town, and\r\ncalled them an illiterate, uncouth, and belligerent race. His own\r\nchapter had objected to so stern a man as provost, and he had\r\nconsequently contented himself with the position of canon, a position\r\nwhich left him ample time for study, and the composition of learned\r\npamphlets. When the Eidgenossen seized him he was bending over his\r\nbeloved books. He was hurried to Constance, and was there, by the\r\nbishop, thrown into the same prison as that occupied by the martyr Huss.\r\nThe higher clergy as a rule connived at the deed, and, though promised\r\nrelease, he was handed over a prisoner to the monks at Lucerne. Here the\r\nlofty words of Cellano, _\"Dies irae, dies illa,\"_ so well known from\r\ntheir use in Mozart's Requiem Mass, seem to have been a great\r\nconsolation to the unfortunate canon. It is not known exactly when he\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\nBURGUNDIAN WARS.\r\n\r\n(1474-1477.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThese wars raised to its height the military glory of the Eidgenossen,\r\nand instead of the limited sphere occupied by most of the previous wars,\r\nwe find ourselves now watching a scene of world-wide interest and\r\nimportance. Three Great Powers--France, Germany, and Austria--if such a\r\nterm is applicable in the fifteenth century, are striving for the\r\ndownfall of a fourth great realm, Burgundy, in some respects the\r\nmightiest of them all. The Swiss League, no less interested in the\r\nissue, is made the instrument for bringing about that tragical ending\r\nwhich strikes Burgundy for ever from the list of future kingdoms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Elizabeth, wife of Albert II.; Maria of Burgundy; Eleanor\r\nof Portugal; Kunigunde, sister of Maximilian.\r\n\r\n(_From Maximilian Monument at Innsbruck._)]\r\n\r\nCharles the Bold aimed at the re-establishment of the ancient kingdom of\r\nLorraine, such as it was created by the treaty of Verdun in 843.[37]\r\nThis was to be a middle kingdom between French and German territory--a\r\nkingdom which, stretching from the North Sea through to the\r\nMediterranean, would absorb the Swiss Confederation, and what of other\r\nterritory we cannot tell. A striking scheme, and one which, if it had\r\nsucceeded, would have greatly changed the face of modern politics.\r\nCharles's deadliest foe was Louis of France, who was unswervingly bent\r\non his destruction. Politically, the two men were the very antipodes of\r\neach other. The romantic duke is the embodiment of mediaeval chivalry;\r\nthe sober Louis that of modern absolutism. His reign seals the fate of\r\ndying feudalism. Louis is like an immovable rock against which the\r\neffete Middle Ages dash themselves in vain. He stands, indeed, between\r\ntwo great historical epochs. Charles is doomed to fall; for pitilessly\r\nLouis crushes his unruly vassals, and feudatory France is by his power\r\nwelded into a mighty and absolute monarchy. The ambitious hotspur, the\r\nwarlike duke, believes himself a second Alexander. And, indeed, in all\r\nChristendom there is no court so splendid as his, no treasury so vast.\r\nHis magnificence is more than royal, more even than imperial, and he\r\ngrapples with numberless intricate problems. To carry out his plans he\r\nstakes realm and life, but lacking patience and sound political judgment\r\nhe fails in his chief enterprises.[38]\r\n\r\nThe preliminary steps leading to the war are a diplomatic maze,\r\nrevealing the double-dealing of the actors, and likewise showing the\r\nuncertain position held by the Swiss League in the empire. The\r\ndestruction of this league, and the overthrow of Charles the Bold were\r\nchiefly aimed at. The maze of intrigue is, indeed, well-nigh\r\nimpenetrable; yet, because the preliminaries are far less known than the\r\nwars which followed, and the actual facts have been often distorted,\r\nthey will, no doubt, command general interest, and we shall try to\r\ndisentangle the skeins as best we can. The battle of St. Jacques had\r\nsecured for the Confederates, not only the sympathies of Louis, but also\r\nthe alliance of his father, Philip the Good, of Burgundy, the Sforzas of\r\nMilan, and others. Since those times of prowess the young republic had\r\nbeen growing into a prosperous and powerful nation, not without its\r\ninfluence on continental military affairs. Admired, envied, and feared,\r\nby turns, its friendship was greatly appreciated, and it lent protection\r\nto all who sought it. So strong was its love of warfare, that it was at\r\nall times ready to avenge any wrong or fancied wrong done to itself or\r\nits friends. Thus, Zurich, in 1456, laid waste the lands of the Austrian\r\nknight-robbers who had plundered some Strasburg merchants on a Swiss\r\nround. Despite the distance between them, the two towns of Strasburg and\r\nZurich were on terms of close friendship.[39] At the bidding of Pius\r\nII., the elegant Latin writer commonly known as AEneas Sylvius, who had\r\nfallen out with his literary friend, Duke Sigmund of Austria, the\r\nEidgenossen conquered Thurgau, which had remained still an Austrian\r\nprovince, and placed it amongst their subject lands. The quarrels of\r\nMulhausen and Schaffhausen with Austria entangled their friends of the\r\nleague into a war with Sigmund (1468), who, to secure peace, agreed to\r\npay over the sum of ten thousand florins, guaranteeing them their recent\r\nconquests. This feud of Waldshut (Black Forest) led to the Burgundian\r\nwars.\r\n\r\nExtravagant but poor, Sigmund failed to find even that modest sum, and\r\napplied to Louis of France for help, but was by him referred to Charles\r\nof Burgundy. The astute Louis saw that a quarrel between the dukes would\r\nbe injurious and possibly fatal to Charles, who, all unaware of the\r\npitfall prepared for him, readily fell in with the proposals of Sigmund.\r\nHe was anxious to join together Alsace, Breisgau, the Aargau towns on\r\nthe Rhine, &c., and advanced fifty thousand florins as mortgage on the\r\ndominions of Sigmund, expecting they would soon fall to him entirely. By\r\nthe treaty of St Omer, in 1469, their mutual terms of agreement were\r\nthus fixed:--Charles to give help in case of need against the Swiss, and\r\nSigmund to promote the long-planned marriage between the son of his\r\ncousin and Maria of Burgundy. Rejoicing at this turn of fortune, the\r\nemperor at once disannulled the treaty of Waldshut, and the new lands\r\nwere by Charles the Bold entrusted to the management of his favourite,\r\nPeter von Hagenbach.[40] A tyrant and a libertine, his acts of violence,\r\nand those of his foreign soldiery, exasperated the German populations\r\nof Alsace, Basel, Bern, and Solothurn. Their merchants being robbed on\r\nthe Rhine, their envoys imprisoned--one Bernese man was killed in a\r\nfray--they complained to the duke, but without result for the cruelties\r\nand oppression continued.\r\n\r\nArtful and ever on the watch, Louis found that the Eidgenossen,\r\ndisgusted by the grasping tendencies of Charles, were fast drifting away\r\nfrom their good understanding with Burgundy, and strove to draw them to\r\nhis own side. Anxious to secure a friend, the Swiss lent willing ears to\r\nthe flattery and insinuations of the crafty Louis. He actually succeeded\r\nin effecting a reconciliation between the Eidgenossen and Austria. It\r\nwas a cleverly calculated bit of diplomacy, that secured for the Swiss\r\ntheir recent conquests, isolated Charles, and strengthened the\r\nopposition against him. Louis fixed a pension on Sigmund, and urged him\r\nto pay off the mortgage on his lands, whilst the Alsacian towns likewise\r\nleagued themselves with the Swiss, and actually advanced Sigmund the sum\r\nof money required. Charles, however, disappointed in his plans, refused\r\nto receive the money. A popular rising took place at Breisach, and\r\nHagenbach was seized, imprisoned, and brought before a tribunal, at\r\nwhich some of the Eidgenossen assisted. He was condemned to death, and\r\npublicly beheaded, as a sort of popular judgment. Enraged beyond measure\r\nthough he was, yet Charles deferred vengeance for the death of his\r\nfavourite, being, indeed, at the time, otherwise engaged. Taking\r\nadvantage of this delay, Louis won over to his side Frederick, also\r\nlavishing flatteries on the Swiss, and pensions on Nicolas von Diesbach\r\nand his followers. This Nicolas was a Bernese nobleman and a skilled\r\npolitician, and was a fit instrument in the hands of a king who\r\ncalculated his schemes rather on men's _mauvaises passions_ than on\r\ntheir virtues. Louis hastened on the outbreak of war, and on October 9,\r\n1474, Frederick called on the Eidgenossen to take their part in the\r\nattack on Charles. They hesitated, but the pensioner and creature of\r\nFrance, Diesbach, notwithstanding the resistance offered by Adrian von\r\nBubenberg, a Bernese noble of far loftier character, in hot haste\r\ndeclared war against Charles in the name of the empire, and with the\r\nconsent of the Confederation. But war once actually afoot the Swiss were\r\nmade a mere catspaw by their partners, and left to their own devices.\r\n\r\nIn a short story like this it is impossible to discuss the merits or\r\ndemerits of the various factions, or those of Hagenbach or Diesbach,[41]\r\nyet we must dwell for a moment on the federal policy, and more\r\nespecially on that of Bern. The position of the Swiss League at the\r\noutbreak of the war was very similar to that of \"Sweden, under Gustavus\r\nAdolphus, in the Thirty Years' War.\" Threatened by the preponderating\r\npower of Austria, she would not take up arms till France, equally\r\ninterested in the downfall of Habsburg, under Richelieu, drove her to\r\nwar by sending subsidies. But French gold was by no means the actual and\r\nmoving cause of the war. Many things concurred to give rise to it, not\r\nthe least being Bern's extraordinary bent for aggrandisement and\r\nconquest. Her aggressiveness and her far-sightedness were quite\r\nremarkable for that age, and her policy was conceived on so large a\r\nscale that she has been not inaptly compared to ancient Rome. Bordering\r\non Swiss Burgundy, Bern had strong western leanings, if one may so\r\nspeak, and very early set her eyes on Vaud and Geneva. She considered\r\nMount Jura as the true western boundary, for French Switzerland still\r\nlay without the pale of the Confederation, and belonged for the most\r\npart to Savoy, or the vassals of Savoy. However selfish the policy of\r\nBern may appear at this distance of time, yet she has the unquestionable\r\nmerit of having brought Swiss Burgundy into the federation, thus\r\nconnecting the French with the German portions of Helvetia. The\r\npolitical views of Bern are clearly evidenced by her foreign relations\r\nat the time. Her nobility sent their sons to foreign courts to be\r\neducated and trained for a military or a diplomatic career--Bubenberg,\r\nfor instance, spent his youth at the Court of Burgundy. Her leading men\r\nwere well-trained military officers or skilled politicians, and the\r\naristocracy which formed the governing body of the town clung\r\nobstinately to the prerogatives still left them in those moribund Middle\r\nAges.\r\n\r\nThe country cantons were less interested in Burgundian troubles, well\r\nknowing that Bern would take the lion's share of any conquests. Bern and\r\nZurich were rivals, and, like Athens and Sparta of old, followed each\r\nits separate ends. Yet when the safety of either, or that of the\r\nfatherland, was at stake, private aims and private animosities were\r\ndropped, and the Confederates rallied to the common standard, displaying\r\nthat wonderful heroism which strong love of fatherland seems ever to\r\ninspire.\r\n\r\nThe first event of the war was the siege of Hericourt, near Belfort, at\r\nthe bidding of Frederick III. This was in November, 1474, and there\r\nfollowed wasteful inroads into Vaud, by Bern, Freiburg, and Solothurn,\r\non the pretext of punishing Savoy for siding with Charles (1475). Place\r\nafter place fell to the victors, and with the help of Bern, Lower Valais\r\nwas wrenched from Savoy, and restored to Upper Valais. But when once the\r\nSwiss were fairly launched on the war all their partners withdrew from\r\nthe stage, and made their peace with Charles. The Burgundian prince thus\r\nhaving his hands more free pushed on alone his expedition against Duke\r\nRene, the minstrel poet of Lorraine, in November, 1475. In the January\r\nof the following year he opened his campaign against the Swiss.\r\n\r\nWith an enormous army of fifty thousand of the best-trained soldiers in\r\nEurope, besides heavy artillery, he started in high spirits across the\r\nJura, resolved on crushing the Swiss peasants, and levelling Bern with\r\nthe ground. Count Romont was sent on in advance, with instructions to\r\nre-conquer Vaud. This he effected within a fortnight, the district being\r\ninefficiently garrisoned. Charles then marched on Grandson, whither the\r\nmain Bernese force had retired. The odds were desperate, five hundred\r\nmen against so vast an army, and, after a resistance of ten days, the\r\ngarrison was allured into a surrender by vain promises of safety, and\r\nby impudent forgeries. The fate of Dinant (Belgium) awaited the body of\r\n412 men who surrendered. They were bound with ropes and drowned in the\r\nlake, or hanged from the trees lining the roads (February 28, 1476). In\r\ngreat straits Bern summoned the assistance of the other cantons, and, on\r\nMarch 2nd, the federal army of eighteen thousand horse and foot, well\r\ntrained and equipped, assembled at Neuchatel, and Charles went to meet\r\nthis force. A large division of the Swiss having gone on in front\r\nsuddenly noticed from the vineyard slopes the Burgundian troops in the\r\nplain beneath. As was their wont in warfare--they were very religious,\r\nalmost superstitiously so, at that time--the Swiss knelt down, and\r\nextended their hands in prayer. To the enemy it seemed as if they were\r\nbegging for mercy, and Charles exclaimed, \"These cowards are ours!\" and\r\nordered his men to fire. His artillery swept down whole files, but,\r\nthough their ranks were broken, the Swiss stoutly held their ground\r\nagainst the oncoming foe. Suddenly Charles ordered his forces to fall\r\nback, with the double intention of getting more room, and of alluring\r\nhis foe into descending from the higher ground. But his men unapprised\r\nof their leader's intentions mistook the movement for an actual flight,\r\nand their ranks began to show signs of falling into disorder. At this\r\nmost critical moment the chief body of the Swiss appeared on the\r\nheights, their armour glittering in the sun. The deafening noise of\r\ntheir war-cries and war-horns (Uristier of Uri, Harsthoerner of Lucerne)\r\n\"struck such terror into the Burgundians,\" reports an old chronicler of\r\nNeuchatel, \"that they took to their heels, and disappeared from sight,\r\nas if a whirlwind had swept them from the earth.\" Not far, however, did\r\nthe Eidgenossen pursue, for, \"with indescribable joy,\" they dropped on\r\ntheir knees to render thanks for the great victory. When they neared the\r\ncamp of Charles the terrible sight they saw stirred up still more their\r\ndesire for revenge. Their brethren were still suspended by dozens from\r\nthe trees by the wayside.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATTLE OF GRANDSON--SKETCH MAP.\r\n\r\nScale 1 in 150,000.\r\n\r\nMAP OF GRANDSON DISTRICT.]\r\n\r\nThe battle of Grandson is remarkable for the immense quantity of spoil\r\nthat fell to the victors. For Charles and his nobles were wont to carry\r\nthe splendour of their court even into their camps. Four hundred silk\r\ntents came into the hands of the Swiss, as well as the arras carpets,\r\nand Charles's sets of gold plate and dishes, the admiration of the\r\nsovereigns of the time. His Flemish lace and fine linen were cut up like\r\nhomespun, and divided amongst the rough soldiers; his money dealt out in\r\nhelmets; his artillery, his beautiful swords and hand-guns; and, most\r\nprecious of all, his jewellery, were shared amongst the victorious\r\nSwiss. Of his three famous diamonds the finest passed finally to Pope\r\nJulius II., another to Henry VIII., of England, and thence to Philip of\r\nSpain, and the third to the kings of Portugal. It would require pages to\r\ngive even a bare list of the spoils.[42]\r\n\r\nDespite this great disaster, Charles did not lose heart, and within a\r\nfortnight began to reassemble his scattered forces. His movements were\r\nclosely watched by the Bernese, who strongly fortified Morat, their\r\nstrongest outpost, sending Adrian von Bubenberg with fifteen hundred men\r\nto hold it against the duke. On the 9th of June, 1476, Charles appeared\r\nbefore the town with twenty-five thousand men, and his artillery soon\r\nmade terrible havoc amongst the weak fortifications. Von Bubenberg,\r\nhowever, vowed that he would not surrender so long as a drop of living\r\nblood remained in his veins. The Eidgenossen forces, which had returned\r\nhome after the last engagement, did not reach Morat till the 21st of\r\nJune, but determined to give battle on the 22nd, that day being the\r\nanniversary of the ever-memorable Laupen. Charles had drawn up his\r\ntroops on the plateaux of Munchwiler, Courlevon, and Cressier, opposite\r\nMorat, and had strengthened his front with a ditch and a barricade of\r\ntrees, having also lined the hedges with his artillery, and flanked it\r\nwith his horse. It was raining in torrents; to weary the foe the Swiss\r\nspent the morning in dubbing knights; Duke Rene of Lorraine, who had\r\njoined the Swiss ranks as simple spearman, and Hans Waldmann having that\r\nhonour bestowed upon them. Towards noon the sun unexpectedly broke\r\nforth, and Hans von Hallwyl, a Bernese nobleman, brandishing his sword,\r\nexclaimed, \"Onward! brave men. God lights up our path. Do not leave your\r\nwives and children to the stranger!\" Leading his van in a wide circle to\r\navoid the hedge he fell on the right wing of Charles. Seeing him thus\r\nengaged Hans Waldmann of Zurich, with his ten thousand troops occupying\r\na central position in the field, marched up, sprang on the intrenchment,\r\nand trampled down the hedge. Carrying their guns across their shoulders,\r\nthey rushed on the artillery, who were keeping up a deadly fire, and,\r\nthrusting back the enemy, soon silenced their guns. Then the Swiss force\r\nadvanced in a close phalanx to the hostile centre, where stood Charles\r\nwith the Prince of Orange, and other distinguished officers, and where,\r\ntoo, were placed the English archers under Somerset. A murderous\r\nengagement ensued, Charles fought like a lion, and soon fifteen hundred\r\nnobles lay at his feet. Suddenly Bubenberg sallied forth with his force,\r\nand attacked the Burgundian left wing, stationed between Munchwiler and\r\nMorat, whilst Hertenstein of Lucerne attacked Charles's centre in the\r\nrear. A terrible panic seized Charles, and his army became suddenly\r\ndisorganized, and fled in wild haste, the Swiss closely following in\r\npursuit. For the whole distance from Morat to Avenches there were\r\nterrible hand-to-hand conflicts, for the Burgundians resisted stoutly,\r\nand the Swiss gave no quarter. Countless numbers were driven into the\r\nlake, and altogether twelve thousand of the foe fell that day, the Swiss\r\nthemselves losing three thousand men. Charles escaped with a few\r\nhorsemen to Morges, but quite dazed with despair, and the Eidgenossen\r\nturned homewards laden with rich spoils. All over the country the bells\r\nwere set ringing to welcome the heroic men who had saved Switzerland\r\nfrom becoming a subject-province of Burgundy. The great battle of\r\nMurten, a purely defensive engagement so far as the Swiss were\r\nconcerned, still exerts on them the same spell as Morgarten and\r\nSempach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD WEAPONS AND ARMOUR PRESERVED IN THE ARSENAL,\r\nZURICH.]\r\n\r\nLuckless Duke Charles had shut himself up in his castle near Pontarlier,\r\na prey to a morbid despair, but hearing that Rene was reconquering\r\nLorraine, he was spurred into taking up arms once more, and started for\r\nNancy with a new force. Rene went back to Switzerland, and even with\r\ntears implored the Federal Diet to help him. The Diet would not\r\nthemselves organize a new army, but permitted men to enlist of their own\r\nwill under Rene's banner. Some eight thousand soldiers enlisted, and,\r\nunder Hans Waldmann, retook Nancy, on January 15, 1477. The fate of the\r\nunhappy Charles is well known; his corpse was found in a bog embedded in\r\nice and snow. A popular rhyme thus characterizes Charles's triple\r\nmisfortune:--\r\n\r\n    \"Zue Grandson das Gut,\r\n    Zue Murten den Mut,\r\n    Zue Nancy das Blut.\"\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of the victors were in no way adequate to the labour\r\nexpended. Franche Comte, to which the Eidgenossen had a title, and which\r\nthe cities wished to annex, was sold to Louis for a sum of money, which\r\nhe never paid, however. The Swiss merely retained the protectorate over\r\nthe province, whose envoys had begged on their knees that they might be\r\nadmitted to the Swiss Federation, to prevent their falling into the\r\nhands of France or Austria, a fate which was, however, to be theirs.\r\nGrandson Murten, Bex, &c., remained with Bern and Freiburg, but the\r\ngreater part of Vaud fell back to Savoy, for a ransom of fifty thousand\r\nflorins. Geneva had to pay half that sum as a war contribution; yet the\r\nway was paved for the annexation of Vaud. Freiburg and Low-Valais were\r\nentirely rescued from the grasp of Savoy.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[37] See Chap. VI.\r\n\r\n[38] One curious instance of his failures may be given. The Burgundian\r\ncrown was ready for him, and he proceeded to Trier (1473) to have it\r\nplaced on his brow by the (Roman) emperor, and push his imperial claims.\r\nHowever, Frederick III., becoming alarmed at the presumption of the\r\nfuture Welsh-German sovereign, broke off negotiations, and fled at night\r\nwith his son Max, who was to have married the daughter of Charles.\r\n\r\n[39] A pleasant story is related to the effect that, on one occasion,\r\nsome young Zurich men started off in a boat by way of the Limmat and the\r\nRhine, taking a dish of hot lentils with them. Reaching Strasburg in the\r\nevening they placed the dish, still hot, on the mayor's dinner table. A\r\nfamous poem, \"Glueckhaft Schiff,\" describes the event.\r\n\r\n[40] Well known from Scott's \"Anne of Geierstein.\"\r\n\r\n[41] For these matters the reader is directed to Freeman's admirable\r\nessay on Charles the Bold.\r\n\r\n[42] The suits of armour, guns, and banners--the suit belonging to\r\nCharles's court jester who fell at Morat, is at Soleure--are stored up\r\nin the museums of various capitals. The golden seal of Burgundy is at\r\nLucerne, whilst the town library of Zurich possesses the seal of the\r\nGreat Bastard, brother of Charles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\nMEETING AT STANZ, 1481, &C.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrandson, Morat, and Nancy stamped the Eidgenossen as the _enfants\r\ngates_ of Europe, and as a nation of the highest military standing on\r\nthe Continent, nay, even as an umpire in continental politics, and a\r\nguardian of the peace. Everybody lavished flattering praises on the\r\nprowess of the Swiss. Nation after nation made overtures to them--France\r\nforemost, Italy, the Pontiff, the Emperor, distant Hungary, and even\r\nEngland, this last desirous of breaking the French alliance. The\r\nmeetings of the Federal Diet often became brilliant congresses, lasting\r\nfor weeks, where princes and ambassadors vied with each other in\r\nbestowing bounties and favours on the Swiss leaders, in order to secure\r\ntheir aid, deeming themselves invincible if the Swiss fought on their\r\nside. The period 1476-1512--from Morat to Marignano--a noble victory and\r\na scarcely less noble defeat, adds another glorious page to the military\r\nhistory of the Swiss League, but the _revers de la medaille_ shows\r\nbitter contention and moral decline. In truth, the Burgundian wars\r\nclosed a glorious epoch, but brought about a baleful change in the face\r\nof more noble warfare, for Nancy is linked with that period of mercenary\r\nservice and foreign pay which became the curse of Switzerland, and which\r\ncould not be checked even by the grand efforts of the Reformation\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nLeaving the foreign wars for the moment let us cast a glance at home\r\nmatters. It is not necessary to dwell at length on the excesses indulged\r\nin by the disbanded soldiers, unoccupied and unaccustomed to regular\r\nlabour after the Burgundian wars. These things nearly always result from\r\nlong-continued struggles.\r\n\r\nMore serious danger threatened the League, through the cropping up again\r\nof the old antagonism between the country commonwealths and the city\r\nstates. Disputes arose concerning the distribution of the Burgundian\r\nconquests, and the admission of Freiburg and Solothurn, which had\r\nsolicited the favour, into the federal fold. In the fifteenth century\r\nthe balance of political power was gradually inclining towards the\r\ncities. Zurich, Bern, and Lucerne, had far outstripped the \"Laender\" in\r\npopulation, wealth, influence, and culture, and in 1481 their forces\r\namounted to 35,000 as against the 15,500 of the other five cantons. They\r\nadvocated the division of the spoil in proportion to their soldiery, and\r\nthe reception of their two helpmates in the previous wars by way of\r\nreward. But the three Forest States, presuming on their prestige as the\r\nprimary stock and foundation of the league, and anxious to maintain\r\ntheir position, resisted measures that would throw the weight of power\r\nentirely on the opposite side. Their narrow and selfish views and their\r\nobstinacy placed the Confederation in jeopardy. Meetings, held to settle\r\ndifferences, only deepened the bitterness. A final Diet was fixed for\r\nthe 18th of December, 1481, at Stanz (Unterwalden), and the foremost men\r\nmet to arrange, if possible, a compromise. But high words were\r\nexchanged, and when the excitement had reached its height, the pastor of\r\nthat place, Im Grund, stole away, and proceeded at dead of night to the\r\ncave Zum Ranft, in a wilderness near Sachseln. Here he took counsel with\r\nNicholas von der Fluee, the famous hermit, who had dwelt there for the\r\nspace of twenty years. Mild words and deep thoughts proceeded from the\r\ngood man, whose love for his country had always been of the strongest.\r\nIn his earlier days he had served as a soldier and a magistrate, had\r\nmarried, and had had several children born to him. But always given to\r\nmeditation, he was at the age of fifty-one suddenly filled with\r\nreligious enthusiasm, and, unable to appease his yearning soul, took\r\nleave of his family, and retired into deep seclusion. His commune built\r\nhim a cell and chapel--still to be seen near Sachseln--on a rock called\r\ndie Fluee, hence his name. A few planks formed his bed, and his pillow\r\nwas a log of wood. Stores he needed not, for he lived on roots and wild\r\nberries, and the saying went abroad amongst the country folk that he was\r\nsustained by the bread of the holy sacrament alone, and ate no other\r\nfood. The peasants regarded his person with wonder and awe, and though\r\nhe was seen at times worshipping at Einsiedeln, no man ever saw him on\r\nhis way to or from that place. The fame of his wisdom spread beyond the\r\nboundaries of his own land, and many were the high personages who came\r\nto consult his oracle--from all parts of the empire and Italy, envoys\r\nfrom Sigmund and Frederick. But into subtle discussions he never\r\nentered, leaving them rather to his priests. \"Pure water does not flow\r\nthrough golden pipes, but through pipes of lead,\" he used to say to\r\nthose who complained of the dissolute and degenerate lives of the\r\nclergy. To this man, then, the good pastor unburdened his mind, and from\r\nhim received solace and wise words. Then he toiled back to Stanz,\r\nDecember 22nd. Finding the Diet broken up, and the envoys on the point\r\nof leaving for their respective homes, he ran to the various hostelries,\r\nand with tearful eyes begged the men to return once more. All opposition\r\nmelted at the name of Bruder Klaus, the envoys reassembled, and listened\r\nwith thrilled hearts to the profound truths uttered by him. Their jars\r\nand differences were settled within the hour, and Freiburg and Solothurn\r\nwere unanimously admitted into the league. Blessing the memory of the\r\n\"Peacemaker,\" the delegates returned home, and the glad tidings of the\r\nestablishment of concord were everywhere celebrated by the ringing of\r\nbells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INNER COURT OF THE ABBEY OF OUR LADY. LUTH CHAPTER OF\r\nZURICH.]\r\n\r\nAnother feature of this memorable day was the signing of the Covenant of\r\nStanz, a series of measures prepared beforehand, but in which Nicholas\r\nhad no hand. They were levelled chiefly against the excesses and\r\ntumultuous risings that were continually taking place in the country\r\ncantons, their object being to re-establish order and prevent a\r\nrepetition of the insubordination, and to set bounds to \"the too much\r\nfreedom in the Laender.\" Despite the resistance of Schwyz the agreement\r\nwas ratified, and gradually became part and parcel of the judicial\r\nenactments of the Confederation. Breathing as they do the vigorous\r\nspirit of Hans Waldmann, the most influential Swiss statesman of his\r\ntime, these measures were, though wrongly, attributed to him.\r\n\r\nThis Waldmann is indeed the most conspicuous figure in Switzerland in\r\nthe fifteenth century, and forms a singular contrast to the humble\r\nrecluse Zum Ranft, for he shared in all the vicissitudes of his times.\r\nFull of vital energy, teeming with lofty schemes, his life is a bright\r\npicture, darkened however, here and there, by deep shadows thrown by\r\nthat stirring, luxurious, fast-living epoch, an epoch itself coloured by\r\nthe Burgundian wars. The career of this remarkable man is a piece of\r\nmoral, social, and political history, quite worthy of a few moments'\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nA poor peasant boy Waldmann had raised himself to the highest position\r\nin the country, that of Burgomaster of Zurich, and head, or king, as he\r\npleased to call it, of the Eidgenossen. The mobile and passionate\r\nZurcher, more than any other members of the league, lend themselves to\r\ninfatuations, and never do things by halves, whether for good or for\r\nevil, to-day hurl down their idol of yesterday, and hand him over to the\r\nexecutioner, so it has been said. A strange career was that of Waldmann.\r\nBorn in the canton of Zug, about 1436, he wandered in early youth to\r\nZurich to seek his fortune, and at the age of sixteen bought the\r\ncitizenship there. Apprenticed in various callings he turned at length\r\nto the iron trade, but his restless mind being unalterably bent on the\r\nbattlefield he enlisted as a soldier at the first beat of the drums, and\r\nplunged into the impending struggles as captain of the Zurich men, and\r\ncondottiere of German princes. In the intervals of peace he turned again\r\nto business, giving himself up at the same time to the pleasures of the\r\ntown. Young, fiery, handsome, with an intelligent face and winsome\r\nmanners, he fascinated the women, whilst his eloquence and joviality\r\nmade him a general favourite with the men, and especially with the\r\nmasses. Many stories were current as to his adventurous life, and the\r\nexcesses in which he indulged in company with other young men of the\r\ntown caused him to be lodged in the Wellenberg, a state prison built in\r\nthe lake. Yet in that age of dissoluteness such failings did not detract\r\nfrom his personal charm and credit. He married a gay and handsome young\r\nwidow of good family, and called himself the squire of Duebelstein, from\r\nthe manor he acquired. This union raised his position in society, and\r\nwith the help of the Constafel, the body of aristocracy with which he\r\nbecame connected, he hoped to get a position in the Government. But the\r\nJunker, or young nobles, treated with disdain the pretensions of a man\r\nwho had once been a tanner, and accordingly he turned his attention to\r\nthe craftsmen and guilds, and was returned as councillor by them in\r\n1473. Beneath his exuberant spirits and brawling temper lay the superior\r\ngifts of the general and the politician, gifts which the Burgundian wars\r\nwere to exhibit to the world. From first to last he shared in the\r\ncampaigns. At Morat we have seen him knighted, and leading the principal\r\ncharge against Charles the Bold; the recovery of Nancy was chiefly his\r\ndoing, for he it was who advocated the continuation of the war and the\r\nappeal to arms by Rene of Lorraine, at the Federal Diet. At the\r\ncouncil-board and in the federal assemblies he rose to eminence by his\r\npolitical and diplomatic talents, and showed himself to be an astute\r\nambassador. Sent to the French Court to negotiate with Louis XI.\r\nrespecting Franche Comte, he lent himself to French influences, for his\r\nmoral principles were by no means equal to his intellectual gifts. He\r\nbecame a pensioner of that same king, who was thus the first to corrupt\r\nthe Swiss leaders with his gold. In his own city of Zurich, Waldmann\r\nfilled a series of public offices; as edile he built the fine\r\nWasserkirche, the Pantheon for war trophies, &c. In 1480 we find him\r\noccupying a high position as tribune, and head of the guilds, and, three\r\nyears later, he was chosen Burgomaster. To obtain this last position,\r\nhowever, he had ousted the powerful Chevalier Goldein. He ruled Zurich\r\nas a veritable sovereign, head of the republic, and swayed also the\r\nforeign policy of the Federation. He dictated terms of peace; to him\r\nforeign princes applied for alliance or troops; and on him they showered\r\ntheir favours. He was made Hofrath of Milan, and, becoming a pensioner\r\nof Austria, began to lean more towards that country than to France, and\r\nrightly so, perhaps. Waldmann rapidly became, in fact, the most\r\ninfluential statesman, and, notwithstanding his extravagant habits, and\r\nboundless generosity, the wealthiest of the Eidgenossen. Thanks to his\r\ngreat ascendency Zurich was restored to that pre-eminence in the state\r\nwhich she had forfeited in the civil strife, and which Bern had gained\r\nin the time of the Burgundian troubles.\r\n\r\nAmbitious, and readily bribed, Waldmann still professed lofty views in\r\nhis home policy and in his administration, and these views he proposed\r\nto put into practice by the help of a political club he had founded.\r\nThis club he placed under the care of twelve influential citizens, who\r\nfollowed his guidance. There was, in truth, a singular charm about his\r\nperson, and his intellectual gifts commanded the admiration of his whole\r\ncircle. He intended making some sweeping reforms that were to change the\r\nface of the Zurich republic. And he addressed himself first to the\r\nnobility, of whom he was no friend.\r\n\r\nHitherto the aristocracy and the craftsmen had been equally represented\r\nin the government (Kleiner Rath, see Zurich), each having twelve seats\r\n(one having dropped away). Waldmann, however, did away with half that\r\nnumber, and supplied their places by men from the Zuenfte, or Guilds, who\r\nwere almost to a man on his side. This not only strengthened his power\r\nas dictator, but increased the importance of the democracy generally,\r\nwhilst it lessened that of the nobility. Nor did he spare the clergy. In\r\n1486 he issued a series of orders against abuses, and compelled Innocent\r\nVIII. to give his sanction to them. Waldmann would at times\r\ngood-humouredly style himself pope and emperor at Zurich. In one of his\r\nwrits he laments the evil consequences of the Burgundian wars, and of\r\nthe Reislaufen, mercenary service. Foreign influence was indeed\r\nspreading fast; the rich contracted expensive foreign tastes, French\r\nand Spanish dress became fashionable, public amusements increased in\r\nnumber, and magnificent family feasts--weddings, baptisms, and the\r\nlike--grew general among the people of Zurich. Waldmann began to take\r\nsteps to regulate these extravagant tastes, although he himself did not\r\npractise what he preached--going so far as to fix the number of guests\r\nto be invited, and the cost of the presents to be given. Public\r\namusements were checked or suppressed, even when of an altogether\r\ninnocent character. Reding of Schwyz advocated Reislaufen in full.\r\n\r\nThe indefatigable Waldmann extended his writs and orders to the country\r\ndistricts, and, anticipating the views of the sixteenth century, strove\r\nfor the centralization of power. This was with the hope of strengthening\r\nhis government, and bringing the detached portions of the country under\r\none general code of laws. For each village had so far its own distinct\r\njudicature. Regensberg, for instance, jealously maintained its curious\r\nright of indulging in ear-boxing at the cost of five shillings in each\r\ncase, whereas the same doubtful amusement cost elsewhere double and\r\ntreble the money. The city Waldmann considered to be the head of the\r\nrepublic, whilst the country parts he looked upon as the less honourable\r\nor subject portion of the body politic. The trade and manufacturing\r\nindustry he monopolized for the town, limiting the country districts to\r\nagriculture and the cultivation of the vine. Numberless were the\r\nmeasures of improvement which the bold reformer showered on his country,\r\nbut many of them were inadvisedly introduced, and the severity with\r\nwhich he carried out his plans alienated all classes, and none more than\r\nthe nobles. Consequently a conspiracy was formed by the Junker (the\r\nGoeldli, the Escher, the Meyer von Knonau, &c.), against the Burgomaster,\r\nwhose manifest opulence gave the lie to his affectation of republican\r\nsimplicity. But blinded by the flatteries of the crowd and by his own\r\npower Waldmann did not see the storm which was rising fast.\r\n\r\nThe ill-advised execution of Theiling of Lucerne, the hero of Giornio,\r\nby the orders of Waldmann, whom and whose banner he had insulted in that\r\ncampaign, turned the tide of popular favour against the ruler of Zurich,\r\nalthough Lucerne, overawed by the powerful Burgomaster did not dare to\r\naccuse him. But a more absurd if less iniquitous order was issued by\r\nhim, and at length caused the tempest to burst forth against him. He\r\nseems however to have been urged on by his enemies, who wished to hasten\r\nhis ruin, and he issued the order most reluctantly. It was to the effect\r\nthat the country folk were to kill all their large dogs, his plea being\r\nthat the animals did injury to the vineyards and hunting grounds. The\r\nconsternation was as great as if Charles the Bold had once more come to\r\nlife. Some obeyed, but at Knonau five hundred peasants met, and resisted\r\nthe messengers who had been sent to effect the slaughter. With this\r\nexample the whole district rose in arms, and, marching on Zurich,\r\ndemanded admittance, March 4, 1489. It would occupy too much space to\r\ngive the story of this outbreak; it was stopped for a time, but broke\r\nout again on April 1st. Waldmann bent on amusement had actually returned\r\nto Baden, a gay watering-place near Zurich, and the rendezvous of the\r\n_grand-monde_ of various nations, but he at once rode back to the town\r\nwith his troop of horses, hoping to check the revolt by his personal\r\ninfluence. But the majority was too strong for him, and surrendering, he\r\nwas with his adherents rowed off to the Wellenberg tower, where he was\r\nplaced on the rack, however without anything worthy of death being\r\ndiscovered. Meanwhile the burgesses held a town's meeting in the\r\nWasserkirche; passed sentence of death on him, and hurriedly instituted\r\na government to confirm the verdict. In his last hours Waldmann revealed\r\nhis nobleness of soul; no bitter accusation against his enemies ever\r\npassed his lips; and he never lost heart, for he knew within himself\r\nthat he had ever aimed at promoting the greatness of the town, and at\r\nthat only. Had he appealed to the crowds he might have been saved, but\r\nhe had promised to his confessor that he would make no such appeal, and\r\non his way to the block he merely begged the thousands who had flocked\r\nto the bloody spectacle to forgive him and pray with him. The people\r\nwere moved to tears, but just then a false alarm was spread that an\r\nAustrian army was coming to his rescue. This hurried on his doom. He was\r\nexecuted in a meadow on an eminence outside the walls, so that the armed\r\nmen might be kept out of the town, April 6, 1489. \"May God protect thee,\r\nmy beloved Zurich, and keep thee from all evil!\" were the last words of\r\nthe dying man, as he turned his eyes towards his loved city for a\r\nmoment before the fatal blow fell. The new government, called the\r\n\"Horned Council,\" on account of its incapacity, was for a while unable\r\nto stop the revolts, and more executions followed. The \"Compromise of\r\nWaldmann\" (_Waldmann's Spruch_) secured to the city the supremacy over\r\nthe country districts, whilst it restored to the city itself its old\r\nliberties. To ask to be represented on the council had as yet not\r\nentered the mind of the country folk. It may perhaps be added that the\r\nquestion is frequently being ventilated in Zurich whether or no a\r\nmonument shall be erected to Waldmann's memory. Opinion is divided on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARMS OF UNTERWALDEN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\n\r\nTHE LEAGUE OF THE THIRTEEN CANTONS COMPLETED.\r\n\r\n(1513.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNo traveller visiting the picturesque town of Innsbruck should miss\r\nturning into the Hofkirche to inspect one of the most remarkable\r\nmasterpieces of German art, the imposing monument erected by Maximilian,\r\nof Austria to himself. Amongst the numerous magnificent bronze effigies\r\nadorning this monument, we find those of Rudolf of Habsburg, Leopold\r\nIII., who fell at Sempach, Charles the Bold, and many others whose names\r\nare familiar to the reader of the \"Story of Switzerland.\" But the\r\ngrandest figure there is that of Maximilian himself, a personage hardly\r\nless interesting to the Switzer, from the part played by that ruler in\r\nthe separation of Switzerland from the empire.[43]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAXIMILIAN'S MONUMENT AT INNSBRUCK, MARBLE RELIEVI.\r\n\r\n(_From a Photograph of the Original._)]\r\n\r\nMaximilian, the son of Frederick III., is the first of a long series of\r\nmonarchs who regarded their high vocation as a serious trust, and\r\nearnestly desired the well-being of the people whom they ruled; and of\r\nan empire sadly torn by the dissensions amongst the various factions of\r\nprelates, princes, and cities, each of which followed its own special\r\nends, regardless of the welfare of the empire as a whole. Desirous of\r\ndrawing more closely together the various members of his kingdom, he\r\nsought to lighten his hold over the Swiss Confederation, the bonds\r\nbetween which and the empire lapse of time had loosened. He was at the\r\nsame time hopeful that he might win Switzerland over for his Italian\r\nschemes. He first invited, and then ordered the Eidgenossen to acquiesce\r\nin the new constitution (1495), and to join the Swabian Bund, a league\r\nformed by the nobility and the great cities, under the aegis of Austria.\r\nBut this sacrifice of their freedom and independence did not at all suit\r\nthe Swiss, and they flatly refused. They quite realized by this time\r\nthat their own federal union was a much better guarantee of safety for\r\nthem than the dubious assistance of party-torn Germany. Moreover they\r\nfelt that the Reichstag, composed only of aristocratic elements, would\r\never fail to really represent and promote their republican and\r\ndemocratic interests. And besides, their strongest feelings were arrayed\r\nagainst Austria. The imperial crown had become almost hereditary in the\r\nHabsburg family, and to submit to imperial rule meant to the Swiss the\r\nloss of all the political freedom and advantages they had gained. Last,\r\nbut not least, after the double-dealing of Frederick III. in the\r\nBurgundian wars, the Swiss could have but little confidence in imperial\r\nrulers. The position of the Eidgenossen was indeed much like that of the\r\nAmericans three hundred years later. They refused allegiance to a\r\ngovernment which placed burdens upon them, but in which they had little\r\nor no share. Maximilian threatened the Swiss with invasion, whilst his\r\nchancellor proposed to bring his pen to bear upon them. But a Swiss\r\nenvoy replied to the monarch that he would be very ill-advised to start\r\non such a venture, whilst to the chancellor he said, \"Why, sir, should\r\nwe fear your goose quills? We are known not to have feared your Austrian\r\nlances.\" For the first time, perhaps, the Swiss truly realized that they\r\nwere in a singularly independent position, and needed no foreign support\r\nfor their protection. The truant child had grown strong and\r\nself-reliant, and would certainly decline to give up his dearly-bought\r\nand much-cherished freedom.\r\n\r\nThis stout refusal, the great friendship of the Swiss for France--for\r\nsince the days of St. Jacques they had been slowly drifting to the\r\nFrench side--and their independent bearing, nettled beyond measure their\r\nSwabian neighbours. Mutual recriminations and accusations followed, and\r\nthe desire of both sides for war was intensified by vexatious lawsuits,\r\nand by serious troubles in the Grisons. At last the flame burst forth.\r\nThat \"Rocky Island\" where three Swiss nationalities mingle peacefully\r\ntogether, afraid of falling beneath the Habsburg sway--for the Austrian\r\nand Rhaetian lands were still inextricably mixed together--sought shelter\r\nwith the Eidgenossen as Zugewandte connections (1497 and 1498), the\r\nZehngerichte excepted. The Tyrolese Government, seizing on this\r\noccurrence as a pretext, summoned the Swabian League to its aid, and\r\nsent troops into the Muensterthal in the absence of the monarch. The\r\nBuendner replied by calling in the Confederates, and war was soon raging\r\nalong the whole line of the Rhine, from Basel to the borders of\r\nVoralberg and the Grisons. The deliverance of Rhaetia (Graubuenden) thus\r\nwent step by step with the separation of the Swiss League from the\r\nempire. This war, called the Swabian war, from the people who took the\r\nmost prominent part in it, glorious though it was in many ways, cannot\r\nbe described in detail here. Maximilian was drawn into the struggle, but\r\nhis troops never entered into the spirit of the enterprise, and were\r\ncompletely routed. No Swiss war has been more fruitful in glorious deeds\r\nand acts of self-sacrifice. As an example we may just allude to the\r\nnoble courage of Benedict Fontana, the chieftain of the Gotteshausbund.\r\nHe led the charge on the strong fortress deemed impregnable in the\r\nnarrow valley, An der Calven (Chialavaina), on the Tyrolean frontier.\r\nLacerated by a bullet he nevertheless covered his wounds with one hand,\r\nfighting with the other till he fell exhausted, calling to his troops,\r\n\"Onward, comrades! I count but for one man; to-day we are Rhaetians and\r\nallies, or nevermore!\" Fired by his example, Von Planta and other noble\r\nleaders sacrificed themselves; the fort was taken, and the two leagues\r\nwere rescued from the Austrian grip. The Swabian war had lasted for six\r\nmonths, the Swabians themselves had suffered reverses on ten occasions,\r\nwhilst in only two cases had the Swiss been repulsed; the German\r\nterritory beyond the Rhine had been wasted; two thousand villages and\r\ncastles having been reduced, and twenty thousand of their soldiery\r\nkilled. No wonder both the contending parties longed for peace, and this\r\nwas secured by a treaty at Basel, September 22, 1499. The effect was the\r\nseparation of the Swiss League from the empire, but this was understood\r\nrather than officially expressed. The Eidgenossen were released by the\r\nemperor from the Reichskamergericht, a step tantamount to acknowledging\r\ntheir independence. One hundred and fifty years later this independence\r\nwas formally declared at the Peace of Westphalia. For a time, however,\r\nmany curious anomalies continued; the Swiss still submitted their\r\ncharters for the sovereign's approval, accepted patents of nobility, and\r\nso forth. But the late wars had again won for them the respect and\r\nadmiration of many of their neighbours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CITY WALLS OF MURTEN.]\r\n\r\nAdmission into the league was now requested by Basel and Schaffhausen,\r\nand their request was granted in 1501. Basel ranked as the ninth link of\r\nthe federal chain, and thus took precedence of Freiburg and Solothurn,\r\nin acknowledgment of its high position and great merits. Basel had\r\nindeed advanced greatly in prosperity. She had opened her University in\r\n1460; her importance as an emporium was great; and she formed a fitting\r\ncorner-stone in the West. She gloried in her union with the league and\r\nthe protection it afforded her; and to show the perfect trust she felt,\r\nshe dismissed all the guards at her gates, and placed in their stead an\r\nold woman with a distaff who, much to the annoyance of the neighbours,\r\nused to receive the tolls. Henceforward the Swabians and the Swiss were\r\nlooked upon as distinct nationalities. Wurtemburg and Bavaria joined in\r\nunion with the Swiss the very next year, and even Maximilian himself\r\nrenewed his friendship with the Swiss states. \"Could there be a greater\r\ncompliment paid to the excellence of the Swiss Union,\" says a German\r\nhistorian, Uhlmann, \"than this mark of confidence on the part of\r\nMaximilian?\" After various refusals, and only after having qualified\r\nitself for taking its position, Appenzell was admitted into the federal\r\nfold December, 1513, despite the resistance of the Prince Abbot of St.\r\nGall, as a member on equal terms, and the list of the XIII. Orte, or\r\ncantons, was complete, and remained closed for three centuries.\r\n\r\nThe Italian wars which follow bear more or less the stamp of mercenary\r\nwars, and are interesting chiefly from a military point of view, only\r\nthe essential points of their story will therefore be touched upon here.\r\nIt has been shown how the league got a footing in Ticino under the\r\nVisconti;[44] and later on the Swiss not only strove to increase their\r\nacquisitions in Italy, but played a prominent part in the wars waged by\r\nforeign princes and powers which set up pretensions to Naples, Milan,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nThe period of the French invasion of Italy opened in 1494 when the Swiss\r\nassisted Charles VIII. of France in the conquest of Naples, which he\r\nclaimed from the house of Aragon. His successor, Louis XII., took Milan\r\nfrom Ludovico Sforza, surnamed Il Moro, with the aid of the Swiss,\r\npromising to cede Bellinzona to the Swiss as a reward for their\r\nservices. Of the numerous enemies he raised up against himself the\r\nbitterest was Pope Julius II., who counted on the help of the\r\nEidgenossen in the task of driving the French from Italy, and the more\r\nso as he discovered amongst them a fit instrument for carrying out his\r\nschemes. Matthaeus Schinner, a priest, was a most remarkable man. Born of\r\nthe poorest of parents, in the Upper Valais, he had in early life sung\r\nin the streets for bread. From this humble origin he had raised himself\r\nto the position of Cardinal, and had become an intimate friend of the\r\nPontiff. Having money, indulgences, and power liberally at command, he\r\nbrought about a five years' alliance between the Papal See and\r\nSwitzerland. The Swiss readily entered into this agreement, as they had\r\nbeen slighted by Louis, and, moreover, their contract with France had\r\nexpired in 1510. Spain, England, and other powers, had likewise entered\r\ninto league with Pope Julius, but his chief supporters were the Swiss.\r\nIn their march through Lombardy, against the French (1512), Pavia\r\nsurrendered, and Milan also fell to the victors. Zwingli, the reformer,\r\nwho had been present in the campaign as camp-preacher, reports that it\r\nwas curious to see the ambassadors of great powers appearing at the\r\nTagsatzung held at Baden to decide on the fate of Milan, and pleading\r\nwith the Eidgenossen for a greater or less share of the duchy.[45]\r\nDespite all flatteries, the Swiss envoys reinstated Maximilian Sforza in\r\nhis heritage, and in return for this they received Lugano, Locarno, &c.\r\n\r\nThe attempt of Louis to re-conquer Milan miscarried. His fine army,\r\ncommanded by the greatest generals of the age, Tremouille and Trivulzio,\r\nwas defeated at Novara in 1513. This siege surpassed all the Swiss had\r\nyet gone through, yet they left open the gates, and in derision hung\r\nlinen before the breaches. Foreign historians compared this battle with\r\nthe greatest victories of the Greeks and Romans. The historian,\r\nMachiavelli, prophesied that the Swiss would one day acquire the\r\nleadership of Italy, but that was not to be, however.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FREIBURG CUSTOM-HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nOn the accession of Francis I., that youthful and ambitious prince\r\nwished to signalize the opening of his reign by the recovery of Milan.\r\nAnxious to have Switzerland neutral he made overtures, which were\r\nrejected. But intrigues amongst the Swiss and dissensions among their\r\nallies worked in his favour, and Bern, Freiburg, and Solothurn, accepted\r\na peace against the interests of Switzerland, and their men returned\r\nhome. Cardinal Schinner, strongly averse to the French, by a false\r\nreport that the enemy was at the gate, brought up in wild haste the\r\nEidgenossen, who had been wavering hitherto. The Swiss followed their\r\nleader who was mounted on his horse, his purple cloak streaming in the\r\nwind, and came up with the enemy at Marignano (the modern Malegnano)\r\nSeptember 13, 1515. A terrific struggle ensued, abating only when the\r\nmoon went down at midnight. Trivulzio had cut his way through the force\r\nwith his sword. Bayard, the \"Chevalier _sans peur et sans reproche_,\"\r\nfor the first time in his life fled. At dawn the Swiss renewed to the\r\nattack. Their fortunes fluctuated till noon, when the cries of \"San\r\nMarco!\" announced the approach of the Venetians. These appeared to be\r\nabout to cut off retreat, and the plain on which the Swiss stood being\r\nnow under water--for the French had broken down the dykes of the\r\nLambro--the Eidgenossen were compelled to retire. This they did in\r\nperfect order, carrying with them their wounded, and retaining their\r\nguns and banners. They were, indeed, rather foiled than defeated, and\r\nFrancis, full of admiration for the Swiss, forbade his troops to pursue.\r\nTrivulzio declared that the eighteen battles he had previously witnessed\r\nwere but child's play to that of Marignano.\r\n\r\nIn the November of the following year (1516) an \"eternal peace\" was\r\nconcluded between France and the Swiss, and this drew Switzerland closer\r\nto her powerful neighbour. The material results of the war were the\r\nacquisition of Ticino (which was admitted a canton in 1805), and of\r\nValtellina and Chiavenna. This defeat was a turning-point in Swiss\r\nhistory, establishing as it did the supremacy of France. The part they\r\nhad hitherto played in European politics had come to an end, and the\r\nascendency they had so long maintained as a leading military power had\r\nbeen strangely shattered. A decline was clearly inevitable.\r\n\r\nA few words may be given here respecting the famous monastery of St.\r\nGall. The cloisters of St. Gall shed a bright lustre on Swabian lands\r\nduring its best period, from 800 to 1050 A.D. This famous\r\nreligious-house was a centre of art and high culture, and was a blessing\r\nto the whole country. We can but allude to some of its famous monks,\r\nsuch as the Notkers, Ekkehard, Rabbert, and so forth; many famous as\r\npoets, musicians, savants, historians, and teachers of the very highest\r\nrank. In the noted school attached to the monastery there resided and\r\nwere educated some three hundred sons of the German and Helvetic\r\nnobility. The discipline kept up was most severe. A story runs that King\r\nConrad I., on a visit to the institution, wished to put this to the\r\ntest, and caused to be scattered under the school benches a basketful of\r\nfine apples. Not a single scholar touched the fruit, and, to reward them\r\nfor this very remarkable self-restraint, Conrad gave the youths three\r\nholidays. But the number of anecdotes attaching to this magnificent\r\ninstitution is endless.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[43] Maximilian, however, lies buried at Wiener (Vienna) Neustadt. The\r\nmonument at Innsbruck was planned by the emperor himself, though it took\r\nsome generations to execute the work (1509-83). Twenty of the relievi\r\nwere the work of Colin of Mecheln, and excited the admiration of\r\nThorwaldsen even. The whole monument is highly interesting from both an\r\nartistic and an historical point of view. Among the bronze figures that\r\nof King Arthur is the most exquisite, and is by the famous Peter\r\nVischer.\r\n\r\n[44] See p. 187.\r\n\r\n[45] \"Here you might observe men's disposition,\" he writes, \"caution,\r\nand cunning. They strive to puzzle one another with the view of drawing\r\nadvantage from the confusion. They pretend to one thing, but hope to get\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT COUNCILS; THE LANDSGEMEINDE AND TAGSATZUNG, OR DIET;\r\nLITERATURE IN THE HEROIC AGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps no better place than this can be found for discussing the\r\nconstitutional affairs of the enlarged Bund. A description of the\r\n_rouage administratif_ of each of the thirteen republics would be far\r\ntoo tedious to the reader, and we shall therefore treat them\r\ncollectively as far as possible. The cantons naturally split into two\r\ndivisions, those _a Grand Conseil_, and the cantons _a Landsgemeinde_,\r\nthe latter including the country republics, the three Waldstaetten,\r\nGlarus, Appenzell, and Zug.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SARNEN, BERN.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the case of Zurich how her council sprang into existence\r\nand became the chief corner-stone of her constitutional freedom, after\r\nshe had been for generations dependent on an abbey. In this latter\r\nrespect Zurich but resembles Lucerne, Solothurn, Geneva, and others,\r\nwhich went through similar phases of development. Bern, however,\r\nreceived the stamp of independence at her very birth--in the very\r\ncharter of liberties involved in her foundation--and her history ran\r\nmore smoothly. Her government at once took an aristocratic tinge, a\r\nclose corporation of dominant families ruling; and in this respect she\r\nresembled somewhat mighty Venice. In the eighteenth century these ruling\r\nfamilies numbered 360, and kept at arm's length, as it were, the\r\ncraftsmen, who, however, were not entirely excluded from a share in the\r\ngovernment. Vast personal property and additional domains acquired by\r\nconquest formed the chief source of the power of Bern, and brought in a\r\ngreat income to the patricians. Rule, domination, statecraft, became the\r\nchief concern of the Bernese aristocracy, whilst in Lucerne, Solothurn,\r\nand Freiburg, the government was, if possible, still more aristocratic\r\nthan that of Bern, and in all these cases was presided over by a\r\nSchultheiss, or Mayor. In the Zurich republic a more democratic spirit\r\nwas found, and the inhabitants were given to industrial and intellectual\r\npursuits rather than to rule and conquest. Her trade was considerable,\r\nand her constitution had done away with the prerogatives of the\r\nnobility. Owing to these things the way was opened for her burghers into\r\nthe government, and there sprang up an ambition among the craftsmen to\r\nrise in the social scale. Zurich is the prototype of the Geneva of the\r\neighteenth century, the two cities greatly resembling each other in\r\ntheir tendencies and movements, religious and political. At Geneva the\r\ncraftsmen, occupying the _bas de la ville_, by their energy struggled to\r\nthe _haut de la ville_, or quarter of the privileged classes. All\r\nauthority was vested in the two councils--the \"Grosse Rath,\" a sort of\r\nlegislative body numbering one hundred or two hundred members; and the\r\n\"Kleine Rath,\" a select committee of the former, consisting of from\r\ntwenty-five to thirty-six members, in whom rested the executive and\r\njudicial power. In the liberal cantons the Burgomaster presided. The\r\nCouncil, however, encroached upon the rights of the people at large, and\r\ndeprived them of direct influence in the management of affairs. Basel\r\nand Schaffhausen followed in the track of Zurich. Genuine democracies\r\nrepresent the cantons _a Landsgemeinde_. The government embodied the\r\nwill of a sovereign people, and from its very antiquity commands our\r\nveneration and deserves special attention. To time immemorial the\r\nancient custom goes back. It was known amongst the Greeks, and we meet\r\nwith it in the \"Volksversammlung\" of the early German tribes--the\r\ngathering of a whole people around their king to administer justice or\r\ndecide issues of peace or war. These assemblies sprang up again in the\r\nthirteenth century, in the Forest Cantons, but now became political\r\nmeetings, from the necessity of guarding against a common foe. The rule\r\nby Landsgemeinde was adopted by eleven Alpine districts, of which two,\r\nGersau and Urseren, were almost microscopical. Five of these were swept\r\naway, Schwyz amongst the number. Of these we shall not speak. Yet the\r\nhoary and patriarchal custom still lingers on in some of the secluded\r\nAlpine nooks, favoured by the isolation of the place, and the _genie\r\nconservateur_ innate in the Alpine folk. Unable, however, to clearly\r\nunderstand the ancient Landsgemeinde except by reference to the present\r\nage, we prefer to draw the reader's attention to the living spring, the\r\nsacred spot where he can \"look face to face on freedom in its purest and\r\nmost ancient form\"--to quote Freeman's fine words--a heart-stirring\r\nsight to witness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CITY WALLS OF LUCERNE.]\r\n\r\nThe last Sunday in April is the date usually fixed for the holding of\r\nthe Landsgemeinde. The gatherings all bear a general resemblance to each\r\nother, yet each shows the influence of the locality, the religion, or\r\nthe industrial pursuits of the people. But whether we see the meeting in\r\nProtestant and manufacturing Glarus, in Catholic and conservative\r\nUnterwalden, or in picturesque Sarnen, the scene is one never to be\r\nforgotten. Dressed in their Sunday best, and wearing the sword, the\r\nbadge of freedom--so orders the ancient ritual--the ardent burghers\r\nflock to the national ring, or forum, to discharge their civic duties.\r\nAfter early morning service, and a grand parade of Landammann and staff,\r\nhalberdiers, troops, and bands of music, the Landsgemeinde opens at\r\neleven with a religious ceremony. At Trogen the hymn, \"All life flows\r\nfrom Thee,\" is sung by ten thousand voices, and, at the call of the\r\nLandammann, the vast crowd falls down in silent prayer. The effect is\r\ngrand and solemn. An address by the Landammann follows, and then the\r\nbusiness of the day is entered upon. The inspection of the yearly\r\naccounts, the election of magistrates and officials, amendment of\r\nexisting laws and the promulgation of new ones, are the chief items on\r\nthe agenda list. All the officers, from the Landammann himself down to\r\nthe humblest public servant, are subject to yearly election, though in\r\nthe case of the chief man re-election usually takes place for many\r\nyears. There are indeed regular dynasties of Landammanns, so to speak,\r\nfor the office may remain in the same family for many generations.\r\nAssent to a proposal is given by holding up the right hand, and this the\r\ncrowd does with great eagerness. The list of candidates is drawn up by\r\nthe Landsgemeinde, but, strange to say, free discussion on proposed\r\nreforms and new laws is permitted only at Glarus. The question is\r\ndiscussed beforehand by the Landrath, a legislative body elected by the\r\nparish. \"De minoribus rebus principes consultant, de majoribus omnes,\"\r\nwrites Tacitus of the German Volksgemeinde, and the words apply almost\r\nequally well here. The Landsgemeinde is, in fact, the supreme court,\r\nwhich approves or annuls. So recently as the spring of 1888, for\r\ninstance, Urseren was deprived of its autonomy and joined to the Canton\r\nof Uri, by order of the Landsgemeinde. And at Sarnen the revision of the\r\nconstitution was agreed to at the open and general meeting. The election\r\nof the Waibel, or Summoner, gives rise to much amusement, for in him the\r\nchief requisite is strength of lungs, he being the mouthpiece of the\r\nLandammann. The installation of the Landammann himself is the closing\r\nscene, and the most impressive one. Slowly and solemnly he takes the\r\noath of fidelity to the constitution, and the people in return pledge\r\nthemselves to stand by the leader. With hands uplifted the vast crowd\r\nrepeats the phrases word by word as they are spoken by the Landammann.\r\nThis mutual engagement between leader and people--their hearts filled\r\nwith the sacredness of the moment, and their voices swelling into one\r\ngrand roll--is almost overwhelming in its touching simplicity and\r\nfervour. That the custom has maintained itself with but minor changes\r\nthrough so many centuries answers for the admirable stability of the\r\npeople, and the suitableness of the _regime_ itself.\r\n\r\nThe common tie that bound together the thirteen autonomous states into\r\none was the Diet or Tagsatzung. It met at one or other of the chief\r\ntowns--Zurich, Lucerne, Bern, Baden, and so forth. Each canton was, as a\r\nrule, allowed one representative, and any one of the cantons could\r\nsummon a meeting, though this was generally done by the Vorort or\r\n_canton directeur_--a position usually held by Zurich--whose member\r\nlikewise presided. The various cantons joined in the discussions\r\naccording to their rank and the order of their admission to the league.\r\nThis will be made clearer by the accompanying list. The Boten, or\r\nenvoys, not being plenipotentiaries, would post to and fro between their\r\ngovernments and the Diet, to report progress and receive instructions.\r\nAs the proceedings were in later times committed to writing, we have\r\nextant a most valuable series of records called Abschiede (= leave or\r\n_conge_). Held at first but once a year, the Diet occasionally met as\r\nmany as fifty times in the course of the twelvemonth, whilst a single\r\nsession would last sometimes for several weeks. At one period the\r\nmeetings became international congresses, at which the most important\r\nquestions were deliberated. But, in truth, the Diet, down to its\r\nextinction in 1848, never again during its long existence exerted the\r\nvast influence it had in its brilliant fifteenth-century period. Yet\r\ndespite its many defects, and its slow and round-about way of doing\r\nbusiness, the Tagsatzung worked successfully--far more so indeed than\r\ndid the German Government.\r\n\r\nA short sketch of the intellectual and literary life of the heroic\r\nperiod may here be given. It is clear at the outset that an epoch so\r\nlargely given over to warfare and political progress would not be likely\r\nto produce much meditative or reflective poetry. \"The clash of arms\r\nfrightens the Muses,\" says an old proverb. (An exception must, however,\r\nbe usually made in the case of the peaceful and sheltered cloister.) Yet\r\nthis active and stirring period brought forth much national literature.\r\nThroughout we find singers who in verse or prose chant the national\r\nglory, and no episode of importance is without its poetic chronicle or\r\ninterpretation; the national enthusiasm vents itself in war-song, in\r\nsatire, in mock-heroics, or in rhyming chronicle. Wandering poets living\r\non the scanty proceeds of their _lieder_; craftsmen who have taken up\r\nthe sword; soldiers by profession--these are the bards of the time.\r\nRugged and unpolished sometimes are their verses, for the Middle German\r\nis in a transition state, and poetry has long since left courts and\r\ndescended among the people. In Germany, as everybody knows, had formed\r\nthe body of the _Meistersinger_. The historical \"Folk songs\"\r\n(_Volkslieder_) are the overflowing of a nation's heart stirred to its\r\ndepths by the thrilling scenes around it, and they are the true\r\nexpression of the temper of the time. We need only allude to the songs\r\ninspired by Sempach and Naefels, and the fiery song of Morat by Veit\r\nWeber, an Alsacian, who fought in the Swiss ranks filled with patriotic\r\nenthusiasm. Lucerne, too, has brought forth many poets--Auer, Wick,\r\nViol, Birkes, and others--who sang the glory of the great wars. A song\r\nand a play dealing with Tell appeared about this time.\r\n\r\nAlong with the poet the chronicler springs up, and numerous instances of\r\nthis class are met with. At Bern we find Justinger (1420), the first to\r\ndraw historical knowledge from the _Volkslieder_, Diebold Schilling\r\n(1484), and Anshelm; at Schwyz, John Fruend; at Lucerne, Melchior Russ,\r\nDiebold Schilling, the chaplain, whose account of the meeting at Stanz\r\nis most trustworthy, Petermann Etterlin, and Nicolas Schradin; at\r\nZurich, Gerold Edlibach, the noble knights Strettlinger of Bern, who\r\nwrote the chronicles bearing their name, and the author of the \"White\r\nBook of Sarnen,\" complete the list. The \"White Book\" is much referred to\r\nby modern writers. The most brilliant annalist perhaps is Tschudi, of\r\nwhom mention was made in the chapter on the foundation of the league.\r\nBiassed as the writers often are--nothing else can be expected from the\r\ntimes--their records bear witness to the national spirit of the Swiss,\r\nand to the intellectual revival taking place. The first Helvetian\r\ntypography was produced by Albert von Bonnstetten, a Zurich nobleman,\r\nand Dean of Einsiedeln, and one of the chief scholars of his age. He\r\ngave a trustworthy account of Nicolas von der Fluee, and the Burgundian\r\nwars. Another great scholar was his friend Nicolas von Wyl, a nobleman\r\nof Aargau.\r\n\r\nThe revival of letters introduced into the subtle scholasticism of the\r\ntime a world of new thoughts, learning, and refined literary\r\ntastes--_humanismus_ as the Germans so expressively call it. Nicolas von\r\nWyl is one of the oldest German-Swiss humanists. He extended the Italian\r\nRenaissance to his native soil by his masterly translations of Petrarch,\r\nBoccaccio, Poggio, and others. AEneas Sylvius, the elegant poet,\r\nnovelist, and orator, who rose to the Papal dignity as Pius II., would\r\nhave had the world forget his fascinating but worldly writings.\r\n\"Rejicite AEneam, suscipite Pium,\" was his request. For twenty years\r\nAEneas had laboured to bring classical culture to barbarian Germany. His\r\nearliest pupil, Von Wyl,[46] became a great favourite at the German\r\ncourts, and with the literary circle which the highly-cultivated Duchess\r\nof Wurtemberg gathered around her. Von Wyl translated some of the Latin\r\nworks of Felix Malleolus, his friend and benefactor; for instance, his\r\nbiting satire on the idle Lollards and \"Beghards.\" He died at Zurich.\r\n\r\nBut if the courts and the nobles promoted the growth of the New\r\nLearning, the universities were its chief support. That of Basel was\r\nopened in 1460, under the auspices of Pius II. (AEneas Sylvius), who\r\ngranted its foundation charter. It rapidly gathered within its walls\r\nsome of the brightest minds of the day, amongst whom we need only\r\nmention the world-famed Erasmus and Zwingli the reformer.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[46] Prof. Baechtold's \"Swiss-German Literature.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.\r\n\r\nTHE REFORMATION IN GERMAN SWITZERLAND.\r\n\r\n(1484-1531.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe age of the Renaissance ushered in a century of intellectual\r\nrevolution, and wrought remarkable changes in art, in science, in\r\nliterature, in religion, and in every department of human life and\r\nenergy. The space at our disposal will permit us to touch only on one of\r\nthese developments, the religious. But the varying history of religious\r\nmovement well-nigh fills up the sixteenth century. The revival of\r\nlearning quickened the spirit of the Reformation, though most of the\r\nsavants disapproved of the movement, as in the case of Erasmus and\r\nGlarean, a famous Swiss scholar. But whilst Luther's training was\r\nmonastic rather than scholarly, and whilst he was, if anything, opposed\r\nto the New Learning, the great Swiss reformer was a scholar of the first\r\norder, who drew his profound and liberal ideas from his study of the\r\nclassics. And it is a curious and noteworthy fact that with the spread\r\nof letters in Switzerland, there started up on its soil a host of men\r\nof parts[47] who, forming a school of disciples, as it were, espoused\r\nthe cause of their great leader, Zwingli, and promoted it, each in his\r\nown canton. This is one peculiarity of the Swiss Reformation.\r\n\r\nThe degeneracy of the Church passed all belief, and was, as every one\r\nknows, the primary and chief cause of the Reformation on the Continent;\r\nbut in Switzerland there was yet another cause, quite as important,\r\nwhich gave an impulse to the movement--the calamitous consequences of\r\nthe mercenary wars, touched upon in previous chapters. Foreign pay had\r\nirresistible attractions for captain and man alike, and the country was\r\nconstantly being drained of its stoutest arms and bravest hearts. It was\r\ndifficult to over-estimate the baneful effects of this practice on the\r\nnational welfare, and, of all the noble men who deplored these results,\r\nnone felt it like Ulrich Zwingli. An enthusiastic scholar, a gifted\r\npreacher, a zealous patriot, and a remarkably able politician, he\r\ndevoted his life to the work of rescuing his people and country from\r\ntheir moral decline. This he proposed to effect by the working of the\r\nDivine Word. Luther left the knotty skein of politics to his princely\r\nfriends to unravel, but Zwingli, on the contrary, shrank from no\r\npolitical difficulties, encumbrances, or complications. To his clear and\r\nfar-seeing mind social and political reform was inseparably bound up\r\nwith religious change and progress. The one would be of but little avail\r\nwithout the other, and the great object of his life became the total\r\nregeneration of the commonwealth--church and state both.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ULRICH ZWINGLI.\r\n\r\n(_After Asper._)]\r\n\r\nUlrich Zwingli was born at Wildhaus, among the song-loving Toggenburger,\r\nin the canton of St. Gall, January 1, 1484. The talented youth was\r\ndestined for the Church by his father, a highly-respected magistrate,\r\nand was sent to school at Basel, and afterwards studied at Bern. Here\r\nsprang up his enthusiasm for classical studies under the famous Lupulus,\r\nwhilst the friars were so struck with his musical talents that they\r\ntried hard to keep him in the cloisters. However, in 1500 he left for\r\nthe University of Vienna, and two years later we find him established as\r\nLatin teacher at Basel and a student of the university there. Steeped in\r\nthe New Learning his attention was now drawn to scriptural studies by\r\nthe enlightened Wittenbach. At Basel, too, he formed a friendship with\r\nthe famed Erasmus. Obtaining the degree of _magister philosophiae_, in\r\n1506, he was nominated pastor at Glarus, and with regret tore himself\r\naway from that seat of learning. During his ten years' ministry at\r\nGlarus (a Landsgemeinde canton) his natural taste and talent for\r\npolitics were brought into play. And though he founded a Latin school\r\nfor clever youths, and pursued his own studies vigorously, and kept up a\r\nvast correspondence with Erasmus, Glarean, and other noted scholars, he\r\nwas no mere pedant or bookworm, but took a profound interest in the\r\npolitical life of that stirring age. Twice he accompanied the men of\r\nGlarus on their Italian expedition as field chaplain, but though he\r\nnaturally rejoiced at the glory their arms acquired, yet his eyes became\r\nfully opened to the disastrous results of the mercenary wars. His direct\r\nand unsparing attacks on the _Reislaufen_ and foreign pension system\r\nroused such a storm against him that he was forced to take refuge at\r\nEinsiedeln, 1516. His two years' quiet retreat in the famous abbey\r\nafforded him a glimpse of the flagrant abuses rife in the Church. At\r\nfirst he appealed to the dignitaries of the Church to remedy the evils,\r\nbut at length, driven no doubt by the sight of the superstitions around\r\nhim, he introduced those sweeping measures of reform which did away with\r\nevery vestige of Romanism that remained in the evangelical church.\r\nPreaching to the thousands who flocked to the wonder-working image of\r\nthe Virgin, his sermons, full of force, novelty, and pithy eloquence,\r\nrapidly spread abroad his fame. He became friendly with other scholars\r\nand religious reformers. Rome made him tempting offers with the view of\r\ndrawing him away from Switzerland and his life-work, but resisting all\r\nher persuasion, he accepted a call to Zurich, as _plebanus_ at the\r\nMinster, December, 1518. Zurich was the foremost town of the\r\nConfederation, but was justly reputed a dissolute city, not unlike the\r\nthen Geneva. Its enlightened Council saw in Zwingli a spirited leader.\r\n\r\nHis opening sermon, on New Year's Day, 1519, stirred his hearers in a\r\nmarvellous way, and at once stamped him as an evangelical reformer of no\r\ncommon type. He briefly sketched out the plan by which he proposed to be\r\nguided in his future sermons. His subjects would be drawn from the\r\nBible only,[48] especially from the New Testament, and he would follow\r\nthe guidance of the Holy Spirit, and not human direction. So profound\r\nwas the impression made by his impassioned and eloquent words that some\r\nof the listeners declared him to be a \"new Moses who had arisen to save\r\nhis people from spiritual bondage.\" The learned Platter writes that\r\nduring the sermon he \"felt himself lifted off the ground by his hair.\"\r\nThe very first year of Zwingli's ministry at Zurich, two thousand souls\r\nwere \"saved by the milk of the Holy Gospel.\" And his practical goodness\r\nof heart was attested by his assiduous attention to the sick during the\r\nplague of 1519, in which he was himself stricken and brought very near\r\nto death. Three hymns composed during this trying time reveal his entire\r\nresignation and calm trust in God. Although he fiercely opposed the sale\r\nof indulgences there were no thunderings against him from the Vatican,\r\nsuch as were hurled against Luther.[49] The Eidgenossen, being useful to\r\nthe Papal See, was rather indulged; it was even intimated to the Diet\r\nthat they should send back from Bern Friar Bernhard Samson, who was\r\npreaching with great effect there, should he prove obnoxious. With\r\nunflagging zeal and courage Zwingli followed his ideal in politics,\r\nviz., to rear a republic on the type of the Greek free states of old,\r\nwith perfect national independence. Thanks to his influence Zurich in\r\n1521 abolished _Reislaufen_, and the system of foreign pay. This step,\r\nhowever, brought down on the head of Zurich the wrath of the twelve\r\nsister republics, which had just signed a military contract with Francis\r\nI. Zwingli addressed to Schwyz a \"Holy Exhortation\" to serve neither\r\nPope nor Emperor; his exhortation, however, served only to increase the\r\nnumber of his political foes.[50] Relying rather on reason than on\r\nforce, he prepared the way for his reforms with singular moderation and\r\nforbearance.\r\n\r\nIt was only in 1522 that he began to launch pamphlets against the abuses\r\nin the Church-fasting, celibacy of the clergy, and the like. On the 29th\r\nof January, 1523, Zwingli obtained from the Council of Zurich the\r\nopening of a public religious discussion in presence of the whole of the\r\nclergy of the canton, and representatives of the Bishop of Constance,\r\nwhose assistance in the debate the Council had invited. In sixty-seven\r\ntheses remarkable for their penetration and clearness he sketched out\r\nhis confession of faith and plan of reform, and utterly confounded all\r\nobjections of his opponents by showing the conformity of his theses with\r\nthe Holy Scriptures. On the 25th of October, 1523, a second discussion\r\ninitiated the practical consequences of the reformed doctrine--the\r\nabrogation of the mass and image worship. Zwingli's system was virtually\r\nthat of Calvin, but was conceived in a broader spirit, and carried out\r\nlater on in a far milder manner by Bullinger. To enter into a full\r\ncomparison of the two systems would, however, be out of place here. The\r\nCouncil gave the fullest approval to the Reformation.\r\n\r\nIn 1524 Zwingli married Anne Reinhard, the widow of a Zurich nobleman\r\n(Meyer von Knonau), and so discarded the practice of celibacy obtaining\r\namongst priests. She made him an excellent wife and help-mate, and bore\r\nhim four children. The reformer's skill in music was often brought to\r\nbear on his children when they were inclined to be unruly; he would\r\nsoothe them into peace and quietness by his performances on the lute or\r\nother instrument. To his stepson Gerald Meyer he was an excellent\r\nfather. Tall, with grave but winning features, with a kind and generous\r\nheart and winning manner, Zwingli's personality was most fascinating. A\r\nscholar but no pedant, a plain but vigorous speaker, of sound and\r\npractical judgment, with vast stores of learning, and an unusual\r\nelevation of mind, he was also broadminded and compassionate. It may be\r\nmentioned that he provided on Ufenau Island in Zurich lake a last asylum\r\nfor Ulrich von Hutten, who had been rejected by Erasmus and driven from\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nIn 1524 Zwingli began to effect the most sweeping changes with the view\r\nof overthrowing the whole fabric of mediaeval superstition. In the\r\ndirection of reform he went far beyond Luther, who had retained oral\r\nconfession, altar pictures, &c. The introduction of his reforms in\r\nZurich called forth but little opposition. True, there were the risings\r\nof the Anabaptists but these were the same everywhere, and the revolt\r\nof the peasants was a general feature of the time.[51] Pictures and\r\nimages were removed from the churches, under government direction, and\r\nnothing was left to distract men's attention, for Zwingli aimed at the\r\nre-establishment of the primitive Christianity in its pure, simple, and\r\nbiblical form. The Holy Scriptures, expounded by the elect ministers of\r\nGod, were to be men's highest guide and support. At the\r\nLandgemeinden,[52] called for the purpose, the people gave an\r\nenthusiastic assent to his doctrines, and declared themselves ready \"to\r\ndie for the gospel truth.\" Thus a national Church was established,\r\nsevered from the diocese of Constance, and placed under the control of\r\nthe Council of Zurich and a clerical synod. The convents were turned\r\ninto schools, hospitals, and poor-houses. The famous Chorherrenstift,\r\nfounded by the Carolingians, was turned into a University College,\r\ncontinuing to be called the Carolinum. This lasted till 1832, when it\r\nwas formed into the University and Gymnasium of our own days. Zwingli\r\nwas elected rector, and lectured on theology. He was also devoted to the\r\nstudy of Greek, and on New Year's Day, 1531, had a splendid performance\r\nof one of the plays of Aristophanes, for which he himself wrote the\r\naccompanying music, grave statesmen joining the professors and students\r\nin the representation. Zwingli was now, indeed, the idol of the people,\r\nand wielded the sceptre in his little state. Under him Zurich became a\r\ncentre of learning and religious enlightenment, and its influence spread\r\nover other Swiss lands, South Germany and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe reformed faith penetrated, but only gradually, into the northern and\r\neastern cantons. Bern was reached in 1528, after a brilliant disputation\r\nheld in that city. Basel and Schaffhausen followed in 1529, and then St.\r\nGall, Appenzell, Graubuenden, and Solothurn, though some of them had\r\nserious struggles within themselves and fell in only partly with the\r\nreforms. But in the Central or Forest Cantons it was that the fiercest\r\nopposition was encountered. Many things combined to produce this result.\r\nIn the first place, the district was a very stronghold of Catholic and\r\nConservative feeling, and religion was entwined with the fond memories\r\nof a glorious past. From the very simplicity of their lives the people\r\nignored the degeneracy of the priesthood, and amongst these pastoral\r\npeoples the priests were of simpler manners and more moral life than\r\nthose in the cities; they disliked learning and enlightenment.\r\n\r\nThen there was the old feeling of antipathy to the cities, coupled with\r\na strong dislike for the reforms which had abolished _Reislaufen_, that\r\nstanding source of income to the cantons. Lucerne, bought with French\r\ngold, struggled with Zurich for the lead. So far was the opposition\r\ncarried that the Catholic districts by a majority of votes insisted (at\r\nthe Diet) on a measure for suppressing heresy in Zurich, whilst some\r\nwere for expelling that canton from the league. The Forest Cantons\r\nissued orders that Zwingli should be seized should he be found within\r\ntheir territories; consequently he kept away from the great convocation\r\nat Baden, 1526. Serious collisions arose, but it is impossible to dwell\r\non them here.\r\n\r\nWider and wider grew the chasm between the two religious parties, and\r\nZwingli at length formed a \"Christian League\" between the Swiss\r\nProtestants and some of the German cities and the Elector of Hesse. On\r\nthe other hand, the Catholics entered into an alliance with Ferdinand of\r\nAustria, a determined enemy to the reformed religion. At last the\r\nProtestant party was exasperated beyond bearing, and Zurich declared war\r\non the Forest Cantons, Zwingli himself joining in the vicissitudes of\r\nthe campaign. His camp presented the \"picture of a well-organized,\r\nGod-fearing army of a truly Puritan stamp.\" The encounter at Kappel, in\r\nJune, 1529, however, took a peaceful turn, thanks to the mediation of\r\nLandammann Aebli, of Glarus, greatly to the disgust of Zwingli, who\r\nprophetically exclaimed that some day the Catholics would be the\r\nstronger party, and then they would not show so much moderation. All\r\nill-feeling, indeed, subsided when the two armies came within sight of\r\neach other. The curious and touching episode known as the _Kappeler\r\nMilchsuppe_ took place here. A band of jolly Catholics had got hold of a\r\nlarge bowl of milk, but lacking bread they placed it on the boundary\r\nline between Zug and Zurich. At once a group of Zurich men turned up\r\nwith some loaves, and presently the whole party fell to eating the\r\n_Milchsuppe_ right merrily. A peace was concluded on the 29th of June,\r\n1529, by which the Austrian League was dissolved, and freedom of\r\nworship granted to all.\r\n\r\nZwingli's closing years were devoted to vast schemes of European policy.\r\nWith the view of forming a strong alliance of the Swiss Protestants with\r\nforeign powers favouring the reformed faith, and in opposition to the\r\nemperor Charles V., he entered into negotiations with France, with some\r\nof the German states, with the Venetian republic, and others. His plans\r\nwere too bold and sweeping to be practical, and came to nought. His\r\nrelations with Luther claim special attention, however. By his treatise,\r\n\"De vera et falsa religione\" (1525), Zwingli had, though unwillingly,\r\nthrown the gauntlet into the Wittenberg camp. The work was\r\nintended to be a scientific refutation of the Catholic doctrine of\r\ntransubstantiation, and a war of words arose. The contest was by each\r\ndisputant carried on _suo more_ by Luther with his usual authoritative\r\nand tempestuous vehemence, by Zwingli in his own cool reasoning,\r\ndignified, and courteous style and republican frankness. Presently there\r\ncame a strong desire for a union between the German _Protestants_, and\r\nthe Swiss _Reformers_--the two were thus distinguished--the impulse to\r\nit being given by Charles V.'s \"Protest\" against the Protestants.\r\nLandgrave Philip of Hesse, the political leader of the German reformers,\r\ninvited Luther and Zwingli to meet at his castle of Marburg, with the\r\nview of reconciling the two sections. The religious _colloquium_ was\r\nattended by many savants, princes, nobles, and all the chief leaders of\r\nthe Reformation, and might have done great things, but came to grief\r\nthrough the obstinacy of Luther, as is well known, or rather through his\r\ndetermination to approve of no man's views except they should agree\r\nexactly with his own. Luther insisted on a literal interpretation of the\r\nwords \"This is my body,\" whilst Zwingli saw in them only a metaphorical\r\nor symbolical signification. Zwingli's logic and cool, clear reasoning\r\nwere acknowledged to be superior to those of his opponent, but Luther\r\ndemanded complete submission. The conference, in short, resulted in\r\nnothing, and nearly ended in an open rupture between the two leaders.\r\nZwingli extended his hand in token of friendship and goodwill, but\r\nLuther refused it. The truth was the two men looked at the matter from\r\nquite different points of view. With Luther religion was almost wholly a\r\nthing of a mystic basis, a creed of the heart--of feeling--whilst\r\nZwingli, required his reason to be satisfied. The one wrestled in agony\r\nof soul with the spirits of darkness; the other looked to the Divine,\r\nall-embracing love under which all creation rests in trust and\r\nhappiness, and under which all men are brothers, children of one\r\nall-kind Father.\r\n\r\nTo return for a moment to home politics. The peace of 1529 was a\r\nshort-lived one. Zwingli anxious only to spread the reformed faith over\r\nthe whole republic did not realize clearly the hatred of the Forest\r\ndistrict against the new creed. Then there were faults on both\r\nsides--the Zwinglian party and the Waldstaetten--but the history of them\r\nis too long and too trifling to be given here. Not the least of the\r\nmistakes, however, was made by Zwingli himself, in claiming well-nigh\r\nabsolute power for the two chief reformed cities, Zurich and Bern.\r\nAgain, the refusal of the Waldstaetten to assist Graubuenden against an\r\nItalian invasion was looked upon with grave suspicion, and caused much\r\nill-feeling against them. War was imminent, and was indeed eagerly\r\ndesired on _both_ sides. Bern, finding that war was likely to be\r\ninjurious to her private ends insisted on a stoppage of mercantile\r\ntraffic between the opposing districts,[53] but Zwingli scorned to use\r\nsuch a means to hunger the enemy and so bring them to submit. However\r\nZurich was outvoted in the Christian League (May 16th), and the Forest\r\nwas excluded from the markets of that city and Bern. The rest may be\r\neasily guessed. On Zurich was turned all the fury of the famished Forest\r\nmen, and they sent a challenge in October, 1531. A second time the\r\nhostile armies met at Kappel, but the positions were reversed. Zurich\r\nwas unprepared to meet a foe four times as numerous as her own, and Bern\r\nhesitated to come to her aid. However Goeldlin, the captain of the little\r\nforce, recklessly engaged with the opposing army, whether from treachery\r\nor incapacity is not known, but he was certainly opposed to the reformed\r\nfaith. Zwingli had taken leave of his friend Bullinger, as though\r\nforeseeing his own death in the coming struggle, and had joined the\r\nZurich force. He was with the chief banner, and, with some five hundred\r\nof his overmatched comrades, fell in the thickest of the battle. Amongst\r\nthe slain were most of the foremost men of the city, councillors,\r\nclergy, Zwingli's friends and relations. Amongst these last was his\r\nbeloved stepson who had been fighting by his side. A canon of Zug,\r\nseeing Zwingli's body, burst into tears, crying, \"Whatever thy faith, I\r\nknow thou hast been a brave Eidgenosse.\" According to the barbarous\r\ncustom of the time the body was quartered, then burnt, and scattered to\r\nthe winds. And the terrible disaster which befell Zurich was followed\r\nsoon after by another.\r\n\r\nBut the reformation was far too deeply rooted to be thus destroyed.\r\nBullinger, the friend of Zwingli, and, later on, of Calvin, worthily\r\nsucceeded to the headship of the Zurich reformers. Keeping clear of\r\npolitics, for which he had no propensity, he concentrated his attention\r\non the perfecting of the Zwinglian ecclesiastical system; working for\r\nstrict morality without narrowness of mind, for national independence,\r\nfor inquiring after light and truth, and for true piety combined with\r\nbenevolence and charity. Zwingli had made mistakes of policy, but his\r\ndevotion to his cause, his self-abnegation, and his tragic death, made\r\nfull reparation for them.\r\n\r\nAt Solothurn Catholicism again got the upper hand, and the reformers had\r\nto leave. Intestine feuds were breaking out, and indeed the first shot\r\nhad actually been fired, when the noble-minded Schultheiss, Nicolas von\r\nWengi, a Catholic, threw himself before the mouth of a cannon, and\r\nexclaimed, \"If the blood of the burghers is to be spent, let mine be the\r\nfirst!\" Wengi's party at once desisted from the attack, and matters were\r\nsettled amicably.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[47] A mere list of names must suffice:--Lupulus, Wittenbach,\r\nOecolompad, Vadian, Oeconomius, Collin, Myconius, Pellikan Platter,\r\nGlarean (the poet laureate crowned with the wreath by the Emperor Max).\r\nThe savants at that time were wont to latinize their names in their\r\nenthusiasm for the classics.\r\n\r\n[48] It is necessary to bear in mind that at that time the Bible was\r\nwell-nigh an unknown book to the common people. There were even to be\r\nfound priests who neither possessed a copy of the Scriptures nor could\r\nhave read it if they had.\r\n\r\n[49] On such good terms with the Pontiff was Zwingli that one of the\r\nPapal Legates sent his own doctor to attend him.\r\n\r\n[50] \"It is meet that cardinals should wear red cloaks and hats,\" to\r\nquote one passage from the Exhortation; \"if you shake them they drop\r\ncrowns and ducats, but if you wring them there flows forth the blood of\r\nyour fathers, your sons, and your brothers.\"\r\n\r\n[51] In Germany similar revolts took place, but Luther took no pains to\r\nappease the peasantry.\r\n\r\n[52] Landgemeinden or gatherings of the parishes, a mode of appealing to\r\nthe people which became the prototype of the modern Referendum.\r\n\r\n[53] Traffic absolutely necessary to the Forest Cantons for supplying\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE REFORMATION IN WEST SWITZERLAND.\r\n\r\n(1530-1536.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of French Switzerland has not yet been touched upon, and\r\nthat for good reasons. It is difficult to realize that down even to the\r\nsixteenth century the French Swiss were still languishing under the\r\nancient forms of feudalism, and this at a time when their German\r\nbrethren had long been enjoying the blessings of national independence,\r\nand had filled the world with their military renown. But, in truth, the\r\nFrench were slow to awaken to republican freedom, and looked to East\r\nSwitzerland rather than to themselves for deliverance from political\r\nbondage. It is a remarkable fact that the Reformation was made but with\r\nthe assistance of those skilled statesmen, the Bernese, the connecting\r\nlink between the eastern portions of Switzerland and the isolated west.\r\nThat Bern rightly calculated on benefiting by this junction is well\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MINSTER, BERN.\r\n\r\n(_From a Photograph._)]\r\n\r\nBefore passing to the Reformation itself, however, we must give a slight\r\nsketch of the political condition at that time of Vaud and Geneva, with\r\nwhich alone we have here any concern. Neuchatel still remained in\r\nreality a separate principality, though temporarily (1512-1529) under\r\nSwiss rule. Vaud had in its time seen many masters which may perhaps\r\naccount for its backwardness in adopting home rule. Its natural beauty\r\nand enjoyable climate have made it coveted at all times, in ancient, in\r\nmediaeval, and, as we shall see, even in modern times. At first a scene\r\nof turmoil and tumult caused by the quarrels of its powerful nobles, it\r\nsank beneath the sceptre of Savoy, Peter, the eminent prince of\r\nSavoy--surnamed the \"Petit Charlemagne\"--having succeeded in\r\nestablishing his authority over the native nobility. Once joined to\r\nSavoy, the fortunes of Vaud naturally depended on those of the Savoy\r\ndynasty. Peter attempted to annex the bishopric of Lausanne, but\r\nfailing, Vaud was torn asunder, and there existed side by side a\r\nspiritual and a temporal lordship. Of the two portions that under\r\necclesiastical sway enjoyed the less liberty. Lausanne was a place much\r\nfrequented by pilgrims, and was a mart for indulgences, but it possessed\r\nnot a vestige of autonomy. It lay \"dormant at the base of its many\r\nchurches.\" When in the fifteenth century the power of the House of Savoy\r\ndeclined, the Vaud country speedily fell into a condition of anarchy,\r\nthe nobility at daggers drawn against the burghers, and the\r\nmountain-dwellers at deadly variance with the vine-tillers of the plain.\r\nBut early in the sixteenth century Lausanne was stirred from its\r\nlethargy by the attempts of Charles III. of Savoy to obtain the\r\noverlordship of the city. Thus threatened, and torn by intestine\r\nquarrels, Vaud in its helplessness seemed to invite the interference of\r\nBern in this affair, and that city on its part was only too glad of an\r\noccasion of interfering.\r\n\r\nGeneva was Vaud's companion in trouble, threatened by similar dangers,\r\nand torn by similar struggles. Here also the bishop was lord-paramount,\r\nbut in this case the stout-hearted burghers had wrested from him a\r\nconsiderable amount of self-rule. Its inveterate enemy, too, was the\r\nDuke of Savoy. But the men of Geneva loved independence far too much to\r\nsubmit quietly to hostile aggressiveness and encroachment; for centuries\r\neven they had kept at bay the designing nobility. Yet at one time the\r\nDuke of Savoy had arrogated to himself the rights of vicedom, that is,\r\ntemporal justice of the bishop as his vassal. Possessing thus temporal\r\njurisdiction, _nomine episcopi_, over the city, he was anxious to annex\r\nit altogether. Geneva was almost entirely surrounded by Savoy territory.\r\nIn the end Savoy arrogated to itself the right of appointing to the see,\r\nand its nominees were, it is needless to say, always members of its own\r\nhouse. Boys of twelve or fourteen, bastard sons even, were not\r\nunfrequently raised to the episcopal dignity. This did not add to the\r\npeacefulness of the district, and the adherents of the respective Savoy\r\nand Geneva factions went about armed to the teeth.\r\n\r\nThe accession of Charles III. in 1504 opened for Geneva a period of\r\nstruggle. Anxious to maintain its freedom against a crafty and malignant\r\nprince, and his creature, the base-born bishop, the city split into two\r\nparties, the patriotic _Eidguenots_, so called from their relying for\r\nassistance on the Swiss Confederation, and the Savoyards, who were\r\nnicknamed the Mamelukes (knaves). Something like half the population\r\nwere Savoyards by birth. Among the patriot party we find the \"Children\r\nof Geneva,\" a gay and somewhat noisy band of patriotic enthusiasts, who\r\nloved fighting and did not fear death. At the head stood Thilibert the\r\nwitty hotspur, Francois Bonivard, Prior of St. Victor, and a noteworthy\r\nGeneva chronicler, and Hugues Besancon, a clever statesman, and the\r\nfather and deliverer of his country. When Charles required the Genevans\r\nto do homage they refused, answering sturdily that \"Geneva would rather\r\ngo begging and be free.\" In 1519, during his sojourn in the city,\r\nCharles punished with terrible rigour this bold stand for freedom; all\r\nwere cowed into submission except Berthelier, who scorned to \"bend to a\r\nman who was not his master.\" His head was one of the first to fall. But\r\nexecutions of one kind or another were soon of almost daily occurrence\r\nduring Charles's stay. Four years later Charles and his beautiful bride,\r\nBeatrix entered Geneva with great pomp, and the princess even remained\r\nfor the birth of her first-born. Charles desired the city to become\r\naccustomed to royal splendour, and to feel real sympathy for a native\r\nsovereign. But all his plans failed. By his eloquence and patriotism\r\nHugues melted the hearts of the men of Freiburg, and succeeded in\r\npersuading them as well as the people of Bern to make an alliance with\r\nhis own city. This alliance checkmated the plans of Savoy. But the\r\nsuccess of the Genevans excited the jealousy of the \"Ladle Squires.\"\r\nThis curious nickname was given to an extraordinary band of the gentry\r\nand nobility living around Geneva. They met at a most frugal supper, and\r\nvowed the destruction of the city. A dish of rice was being served by\r\nthe duke with a large spoon or ladle when one of the guests suddenly\r\nbrandishing the implement fiercely exclaimed, \"With this I shall swallow\r\nGeneva!\" By an oath the men assembled bound themselves to seek the\r\ndestruction of the obnoxious city, and hung their ladles round their\r\nnecks in token of adherence. These \"Seigneurs de la Cuiller,\" though\r\nunable to carry out their design, were yet able to work much mischief to\r\nGeneva, by cutting it off from the necessaries of life, and by keeping\r\nup a desultory but none the less harassing warfare against it. More than\r\nthis, Bonivard was by order of the duke ousted from his living, and\r\nthrown into the castle of Chillon, in 1530.[54] In this same year,\r\nhowever, a new attack on the part of Savoy was checked by Bern and\r\nFreiburg, and Charles was forced to sign the treaty of St. Julien,\r\nguaranteeing the independence and freedom from molestation of Geneva. It\r\nwas stipulated that should the treaty be violated by Savoy it should\r\nforfeit Vaud to Bern.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Bern ventured on the introduction of the reformed faith\r\ninto French Switzerland, hoping thereby to deepen her interest in that\r\nquarter. She found a suitable instrument in the person of Guillaume\r\nFarel, a fiery Frenchman from Dauphine. The most intrepid and daring of\r\nchampions of the gospel, he had fled from his native soil to Switzerland\r\nto avoid religious persecution, and had been expelled from Basel for his\r\nfanaticism. Supported by \"Leurs excellences les Messieurs de Berne,\" as\r\nthe government of that city was styled, he wandered about as an\r\nitinerant reformer, visiting Vaud and Neuchatel. Through his efforts the\r\nlatter canton adopted Zwingli's doctrines, in 1530, Vaud obstinately\r\nrefusing the reformation, except in that portion of the district subject\r\nto Bern. Farel's preaching always excited the mob, and his harangues\r\ngenerally ended in a scuffle. He would often stop a priest on the road\r\nand fling into the river the host or the relics he carried. He had even\r\nbeen known to burst into a church during mass, and inveigh against\r\nAntichrist from the pulpit. Buffetings and prison alike failed to stop\r\nhis efforts, for rough though his manner of controversy was, he was yet\r\ndeeply in earnest. Going to Geneva, in 1532, his very name so stirred\r\nthe Catholics there that he was obliged to flee for his life. The\r\nProtestant party in the city were strong and well organised, and they\r\ncounted on the assistance of Bern, and that important state, anxious to\r\nconvert the whole west, if possible, threatened Geneva with her\r\ndispleasure should Farel not be favourably received. Thus Geneva was\r\nsuddenly called upon to decide between the friendship of Bern, and that\r\nof Freiburg, where the Catholic party was dominant. Fear of Savoy\r\ndecided Geneva in favour of Bern, which certainly was a more powerful\r\nally than Freiburg. Furbity, an eloquent priest, who had been chosen to\r\ncontrovert the reformers' teachings, was to be discharged, and Farel,\r\nFromment (another Frenchman), and Viret, a very able Vaudois, one of\r\nFarel's disciples, were established at Geneva, in 1534, by the desire of\r\nBern. The new faith rapidly spread, and fresh attacks on the part of\r\nSavoy against Geneva only served to promote its extension. A religious\r\ndiscussion arranged by Bern, and conducted (on the reformed side) by\r\nFarel, took place at Geneva, in 1535, and resulted in the full\r\nestablishment of the Zwinglian doctrine in that city. During the\r\ndisputations an embassy from the Bernese attended the city council to\r\nmake known the will of the ruling state, much after the manner of the\r\nproud and austere Roman senators of old.\r\n\r\nBut neither the ousted Catholics nor Savoy was inclined to submit tamely\r\nto this state of things. Geneva was a perfect hotbed of dissension. Duke\r\nCharles laid siege to the city, both by land and by water. A sudden\r\nchange in French politics prompted Bern to show more active energy than\r\nit had lately shown. Two claimants for the Duchy of Milan appeared,\r\nFrancis I. and the Emperor Charles V. To facilitate its conquest the\r\nformer also planned the annexation of Savoy, intending to include Geneva\r\nas the key to Rhone valley. Bern thus seeing threatened the safety of a\r\ncity which it was itself coveting, declared war on Savoy, and marched\r\nsix thousand men into the Vaud country. The pretext set up by Bern was\r\nthat Savoy had violated the treaty of St. Julien. Vaud was seized\r\nwithout striking a blow, and portions of Savoy, Gex, and Chablais, were\r\nannexed. In great triumph the Bernese army entered Geneva, but fear of\r\nFrance, and the proud and noble bearing of the Genevese, prevented the\r\nBernese from attempting to put into execution any plans they might have\r\nhad for annexing the republic. It was in this campaign that Bonivard was\r\nrescued.\r\n\r\nGreat was the disappointment of Vaud to find that it had only changed\r\nmasters; had been rescued from the grasp of Savoy to fall beneath the\r\nsway of Bern, though the latter master was certainly in every way\r\nsuperior to the former. It will be well understood that this treatment\r\non the part of Bern would later on give rise to serious troubles. Indeed\r\nto this day Vaud bears a grudge against her former master. However the\r\npowerful canton set up order and discipline in the disorganized district\r\nof Vaud, and gave it the _cachet_ of its exemplary administration. It\r\nwas divided into governmental districts and managed by eight Bernese\r\nlandvoegte. It agrees with the laws of Bern though its local\r\nadministration was left it. Every effort was made to establish the\r\nreformed faith, and a disputation was held at Lausanne. In this Calvin\r\ntook a part, but not a prominent one. The result was, however, the\r\ndownfall of Catholicism in the district, deeply-rooted though it had\r\nbeen. Schools were established, and the Academy was founded by Bern. In\r\nthis way the French position of the country was cemented to the eastern\r\nhalf. It was not till the Great Revolution that the prerogatives of the\r\ngoverning cantons were shaken, the immense wealth of the cathedral of\r\nLausanne went to fill the state coffers of Bern, and the funds of the\r\nvarious churches were left to provide schools.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[54] For a fuller account of Bonivard the reader is referred to\r\nMarc-Monnier's \"Geneve et ses poetes.\" It is of course well known that\r\nthough Bonivard's adventures suggested the idea of Byron's beautiful\r\n\"Prisoner of Chillon,\" the story in the poem is almost entirely\r\nfictitious. In truth, Bonivard was liberated by Bern in 1536, and set\r\nhimself to write the annals of his city of Geneva. He was married no\r\nfewer than four times. He seems to have been frequently cited before the\r\nConsistory for gambling and other like offences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV.\r\n\r\nGENEVA AND CALVIN.\r\n\r\n(1536-1564.)\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitical and religious changes had brought about in Geneva a confusion\r\nwhich Farel felt himself incapable of lessening. By vehement intreaties,\r\ntherefore, and even by threats, he induced Calvin to join him in his\r\nmissionary work, Calvin being already known to the world as the author\r\nof \"Institutio Christianae Religionis,\" a work that fell on men like a\r\nrevelation. John Calvin, or Cauvin, was born at Noyon, in Picardy, in\r\n1509, and was a northern Frenchman of superior intelligence and\r\nlearning, but of a gloomy, austere disposition, with a large admixture\r\nof fatalism in his views. Destined for the Church, he studied in Paris\r\nat the early age of thirteen, but by his father's wish he changed his\r\nintention, and applied himself to the study of law, at Orleans and\r\nBourges. To these latter studies he owed that wonderful facility in\r\nsystematic reasoning which is so noticeable in his writings. But the\r\ndeath of his parent in 1531 brought Calvin once more to Paris, where he\r\nspeedily found himself drawn into the new religious movement which was\r\nwinning its way in France. Profound theological researches and severe\r\ninward struggles caused his conversion to the reformed faith, in the\r\nfollowing year. In 1535 we find him at Basel, whither he had retired to\r\nescape further persecution on account of his extreme views. Here he\r\npublished his \"Christianae Religionis Institutio,\" which is his most\r\ncelebrated work, and which has shed undying lustre on his name.\r\nFascinating by its profound learning, its unflinching logic, and its\r\nwonderful fervour, the book became at once a general favourite, and was\r\ntranslated into all the civilized tongues. It is not necessary to do\r\nmore than place before the reader one or two essential features of this\r\ngreat work. It is of mathematical exactness, and is the very base and\r\nfoundation of his remarkable religious system, while it likewise maps\r\nout his scheme of reformation. This scheme was based on the doctrine of\r\npredestination, a doctrine Calvin had embraced with eagerness.\r\nPredestination was indeed with him a religious axiom, a self-evident\r\ntruth which neither needed proof nor admitted of dispute, and he made it\r\nthe corner-stone of his new religious system. His theory was that, of\r\nmen all equally guilty _a priori_, some had from the beginning of the\r\nworld been destined by God for eternal happiness, others for eternal\r\nperdition. Who were the elect and who the rejected was left an open\r\nquestion. However incompatible with humane feeling, however\r\nirreconcilable with the doctrine of the redemption, this belief might\r\nbe thought by many, it yet sufficed for the eager minds of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, earnestly seeking as they were some practicable and, as it\r\nwere, palpable, faith. Whatever the objections to the doctrine, it was\r\non this that the Calvinistic Church was built, and by its spirit that\r\nthat Church was swayed.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1536 that Calvin settled in Geneva. With Farel he undertook\r\nthe reorganization of the Church on the lines marked out in his\r\n\"Institutes,\" entirely sweeping away previous reforms. A \"confession of\r\nfaith\" was drawn up and subscribed to by the people, and a new Church\r\nconstitution was adopted which involved the establishment of a Church\r\ncensorship, or rather a Church police. The rigorous discipline enforced,\r\nhowever, clashed with the Genevans' notions of present freedom, and the\r\ncivil magistrates stoutly contested the right of the pulpit to find\r\nfault with the secular government, or interfere in the public\r\nadministration. For the Genevese were a gay and pleasure-loving people,\r\nand they were moreover boisterous, undisciplined, and fond of\r\ndisputation. A bold stand was made against the \"Popery on Leman Lake,\"\r\nby the national party. The spirit of opposition was quickened by the\r\ndisappointment of Bern at the overthrow of her reformation movement and\r\nritual,[55] and the immigration of French refugees who strengthened\r\nCalvin's party. Bickerings, disorderly scenes, riots, both inside and\r\noutside the churches, followed, and the direct disobedience of Calvin\r\nand Farel to a civil decree of suspension prompted the government to\r\npass sentence of banishment against them in 1538. Amidst the revilings\r\nand hootings of the mob they quitted Geneva, Farel going to Neuchatel,\r\nwhere he remained till his death in 1565, and Calvin to Strasburg.\r\n\r\nIn this more tolerant German city he came into daily contact with the\r\nworkings of the Lutheran and Zwinglian professions. He attempted to\r\nmediate between them with the view of reconciling their opposing views\r\non the Eucharist, but failed. He admired Melanchthon, but considered\r\nthat his temporizing measures resulted in laxity of discipline. He was\r\ngrieved, too, by the little regard shown to the clergy, and by their\r\ndependence on the courts, and the contemplation of all this served to\r\nconfirm him in his own views. He never lost sight of the aim of his\r\nlife--to make the Genevan Church, which he loved as his own soul, the\r\nrallying point for his persecuted countrymen. His plans were greatly\r\nfavoured by several circumstances: the quarrels convulsing Geneva during\r\nhis exile, and the incapacity of the new ministry there; above all, the\r\nwell-founded dread of Bern's supremacy. This fear brought into existence\r\nthe party nicknamed the Guillermins, from Guillaume Farel, which\r\nliterally drove the Genevans into the fold of Calvinism. Yet Calvin at\r\nfirst hesitated to return. \"Why should I replunge into that yawning\r\ngulf,\" he writes to Farel, \"seeing that I dislike the temper of the\r\nGenevese, and that they cannot get used to me?\" But believing himself\r\ncalled by God, he yielded, and, amidst acclamations and rejoicings, he\r\nwas welcomed back to the city in 1541.\r\n\r\nSpeaking roughly Calvin began his reforms where Luther and Zwingli had\r\nstopped; they had broken the ice for him, and shown him the way. He\r\ndemanded implicit and unquestioning obedience to the Divine Word, for\r\nhuman reason, he said, was \"as smoke in the sight of God.\" His aim was\r\nto found a kingdom of God in the spirit of the ancient prophets, and\r\nruled by equally rigorous laws. Excluding the people from direct control\r\nin church matters, he lodged the chief authority in the clergy, a class\r\nwhich was also to have the preponderance in the state. By skilful\r\norganization he established a theocracy with strong aristocratic\r\nleanings, the democratic element being almost entirely excluded. Geneva\r\nbecame indeed \"the city of the spirit of stoicism, built on the rock of\r\npredestination.\" But the most curious institution of the Calvinistic\r\nChurch was the _Consistoire_, a body of twelve chosen from the oldest\r\ncouncillors and the city clergy, Calvin himself being usually at the\r\nhead. This tribunal was 01 authority in spiritual and moral, and in\r\npublic and private, matters alike. Calvin's intention was to change the\r\nsinful city into a sanctified city--a \"city of God.\" The members of the\r\nConsistoire had power to enter private houses, and to regulate even the\r\nsmallest concerns of life, and they admonished or punished offenders as\r\nthey thought fit. Even the most trivial matters came within its ken; it\r\nprescribed the fashions, even down to the colour of a dress, and fixed\r\nthe _menus_ of the table, not less than it enforced attendance at\r\nreligious worship. The table was by no means profusely supplied either,\r\nonly one dish of meat and one of vegetables being allowed, and no\r\npastry, and only native wine. We find girls cited before the Consistoire\r\nfor skating, a man for sniffing in church, two others for talking\r\nbusiness when leaving church. Every now and then Bonivard was brought up\r\nfor card playing, and other disorderly deeds. A hairdresser adorning a\r\nlady's hair, together with the friends present, was sent to gaol. To the\r\nGenevans theatre-going was the chief occupation in life, but\r\nnevertheless theatrical performances were suspended, and remained so\r\ntill shortly before the advent of Voltaire, who, indeed, gloried in\r\nleading back the strait-laced Genevans to worldliness and pleasure. But\r\nnot only was the theatre forbidden, but likewise dancing, games, and\r\nmusic, except psalm-singing. No wonder the Muses left Geneva! Objects of\r\nart, and even those of home comfort, were objected to by iconoclasts\r\nlike Calvin. The once gay Geneva sank into a dull, narrow-minded city of\r\nthe true Puritan type. Indeed, as is well known, she furnished the\r\npattern for later Puritanism. The Consistoire reserved to itself the\r\nright of excommunication, that is, of exclusion from the Communion,\r\nthough secular or physical punishments were left to the Council.\r\n\r\nThe criminal history of the Genevan Republic reflects the temper of the\r\ntime, and the spirit of the ecclesiastical leaders. Vice was mercilessly\r\npunished, and drunkenness, blasphemy, and unbelief were put in the same\r\ncategory with murder. One reads with dismay of the state of terrorism\r\nprevailing during the plague raging about the middle of the century.\r\nSuperstition was rife and increasing, and every kind of torture was used\r\nto extort confessions from accused persons. Whilst the plague was at its\r\nworst the sword, the gallows, the stake were equally busy. The jailor\r\nasserted that his prisons were filled to excess, and the executioner\r\ncomplained that his arms were tired. Within a period of three years\r\nthere were passed fifty-eight sentences of death, seventy-six of\r\nbanishment, and eight to nine thousand of imprisonment, on those whose\r\ncrime was infringement of the Church statutes. Offences against himself\r\npersonally Calvin treated as blasphemy, as he identified himself with\r\nthe prophets of old. Strange as this assertion is, it can be supported.\r\nA single instance will suffice. One Pierre Amieaux, a councillor, had\r\nonce in company spoken of Calvin as a bad man. This the reformer\r\ndeclared to be blasphemy, and refused to preach again till satisfaction\r\nwas done to him.[56]\r\n\r\nIn such manner was Geneva forced into obedience. However, there was one\r\npowerful check on Calvin's progress, viz., the efforts of the national\r\nparty, the \"Children of Geneva,\" as they called themselves, or the\r\n\"Libertines,\" as their opponents nicknamed them.[57] An excellent way of\r\nneutralizing the influence of these, Calvin tells his friend Bullinger,\r\nat Zurich, was to expel the natives and admit French _emigres_ to the\r\nGenevan citizenship. \"The dogs are barking at me on all sides,\" he\r\ncomplains to the same friend, and now and then he made a clean sweep of\r\nhis adversaries. The Genevans naturally looked with disfavour on\r\nCalvin's policy, objecting to the French refugees not so much from ill\r\nwill as from a natural dislike to leaving a city to which they were so\r\ndevotedly attached, and seeing the positions of honour and influence\r\ntaken up by the strangers. At last, exasperated beyond measure by the\r\nadmission of a fresh batch of refugees, the Libertines attempted a _coup\r\nde main_ on the Calvin government, May, 1555. The attempt miscarried,\r\nand the ringleaders were put to death or imprisoned, and most of the\r\nrank and file expelled from the city. To fill the great gaps thus\r\ncaused, three hundred and fifty-nine French families were admitted\r\ngradually to the citizenship, and in this way within a few years the\r\npopulation increased from thirteen thousand to twenty thousand. Such\r\nhigh-handed proceedings--wholesale proscriptions one might call\r\nthem--caused the wheels to run smoothly enough, and Calvin was now\r\ncompletely master of the situation. The imprisonment and burning of\r\nServetus for denying the doctrine of the Trinity once more ruffled the\r\nsmooth surface of affairs, yet helped if possible to increase Calvin's\r\nprestige and influence. Every one knows of the endless discussions that\r\nhave since taken place as to Calvin's part in putting to death the\r\nlearned and unfortunate Spaniard. But Calvin's own defence would seem\r\nto show that it was he who was chiefly the leader in the matter.[58]\r\n\r\nHis pre-eminence now fully established and acknowledged, Calvin founded\r\nthe Academy, in 1559, in order to provide ministers for the reformed\r\nchurches generally. Learned French _emigres_ were appointed to the\r\nprofessorships, and Theodore de Beze (Beza) was made rector, and the\r\ninstitution became the glory of the city. From all parts sympathizers\r\nflocked to Geneva--Italians, English,[59] Spanish, Germans, mostly\r\nFrench and Italians, however--and churches to suit the different\r\nnationalities sprang up. On Leman Lake they found another Rome, and\r\nanother inspired and infallible Pope, albeit a Protestant Pope. At the\r\nfirst view of the sacred city they sank on their knees and sang songs of\r\njoy and praise, as if they had sighted a new Jerusalem. Wittenberg had\r\nwitnessed similar scenes. No fewer than thirteen hundred French and\r\nthree hundred Italian families had made Geneva their second home, and\r\nmen of the greatest mark had settled there temporarily or for good.\r\nMissionaries went to France to rally and strengthen the Huguenots, and\r\nsome two thousand communes were converted to the new faith. Religious\r\nchampions, like the intrepid John Knox, Peter Martyr, Marnix (de St.\r\nAldegonde), went to Scotland, England, or the Netherlands, to advance\r\nthe cause of Calvinism. To Geneva as their mother church may look\r\nPuritans and Presbyterians.\r\n\r\nCalvinism but little affected Switzerland at large during the lifetime\r\nof its founder. Its absolutism and narrowness clashed with the milder\r\nand more advanced, and, if one may say so, more ideal views of the\r\nZwinglian system. It was due to the conciliatory spirit of Bullinger and\r\nto his noble efforts that the Churches of Zurich and Geneva--while other\r\ncountries were distracted with religious differences--drew together as\r\nfriends, and that their doctrines were blended in official \"confessions\"\r\nof faith. Viret's attempts to plant Calvinism in Vaud failed, as did\r\nthose of Farel in Neuchatel.\r\n\r\nAnd if Geneva did not regard her great master with affection, she bowed\r\nbefore him in profound veneration. Without him the ancient, frivolous,\r\nand quarrelsome city could hardly have kept at bay her many foes. But\r\ntrained in the school of Calvinism she gathered moral strength, and\r\nbecame the \"abode of an intellectual light that has shone for three\r\ncenturies, and that, though growing pale, is not yet extinguished.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THALER OF 1564.\r\n\r\n(_Laus et gloria soli Deo optimo maximo._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THALER OF 1564.\r\n\r\n(_Moneta nova Civitatis San Gallensis, 1564._)]\r\n\r\nCalvin was a prodigious worker, a profound theologian, an accomplished\r\nlinguist, a statesman and organizer of consummate skill, and a most\r\nexcellent correspondent. Twenty-four printing-presses were kept at work\r\nday and night multiplying his writings in different languages. No fewer\r\nthan 2,025 sermons of his have been collected, and 4,721 letters. For\r\nthe French language Calvin did much what Luther did for the German. His\r\nframe, at all times weak, became still more enfeebled by continued\r\nillness, and it seemed impossible that he should be physically fit to\r\nlabour as he did, but his religious enthusiasm was able to triumph over\r\nbodily ailments. Bright, sparkling eyes lit up his pale and emaciated\r\nfeatures. Averse to earthly pleasures, careless of popular applause, of\r\nstrong and unbending will--though not devoid of deep feeling--he\r\ncommanded men's awe rather than their affection. His near personal\r\nfriends were devotedly attached to him, and on the death of his wife,\r\nwho sank when bereaved of her children, his tenderness breaks forth in\r\nletters to his friends. \"If I did not make a strong effort to moderate\r\nmy grief,\" he writes to Viret, \"I should succumb.\" He died in May, 1564,\r\nand even in his last moments had words of censure for those who had come\r\nto take leave of him. His death is registered in these curious terms:\r\n\"Aujourd'hui spectable Jean Calvin s'en est alle a Dieu, sain et entier,\r\ngrace a Dieu, de sens et entendement.\" Beza was elected his successor;\r\nand, less severe and more conciliating than his friend and predecessor,\r\nhe exerted great influence, both at Geneva and in the reformed countries\r\ngenerally. Beza's death occurred in 1603.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[55] The Bern, that is, the Zwinglian, ritual preserved several things\r\nwhich the French reformers rejected, amongst others, the four high fete\r\ndays, the baptismal font, and the use of unleavened bread in the\r\nCommunion.\r\n\r\n[56] Amieaux was led in his shirt through the city, with a lighted torch\r\nin his hand, and was required to confess his fault in three different\r\npublic squares.\r\n\r\n[57] These \"Lovers of Freedom\" were stigmatized by the opposite party as\r\n\"men of loose morals,\" but of such there were not a few amongst the\r\nCalvinists themselves.\r\n\r\n[58] The Swiss churches under the aegis of Bullinger acquiesced, not so\r\nmuch from a spirit of intolerance, as from a fear that the influence of\r\nServetus might undermine French Protestantism. Rome envied Calvin the\r\nhonour of having condemned Servetus to the flames.\r\n\r\n[59] Amongst the English we find the names of Spencer, Coxe, Chambers,\r\nBishop Hooper, and the Bishops of Exeter, Norwich, Durham, and\r\nSalisbury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV.\r\n\r\nTHE CATHOLIC REACTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe benefits conferred by the Reformation on Switzerland were\r\ncounterbalanced by a religious schism which divided the land into two\r\nantagonistic moieties, and paralyzed political progress. The religious\r\nenthusiasm in Europe had spent itself in the first half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and the energy it had displayed had roused amongst the\r\nCatholics a corresponding activity. They were led by the famous Philip\r\nII. of Spain, but fortunately Queen Elizabeth of England was able to\r\nwithstand the attack directed against her country. But the new order of\r\nJesuits, lately launched on the world to undo the work of the religious\r\nreformers, took the field with united ranks; whilst, on the other hand,\r\nthe Protestants, split as they were into sections, and stumbling over\r\nquestions of dogma, lacked the unity of aim and purpose necessary to\r\nstand successfully an attack so formidable. The wars of Schmalkalden\r\n(1547-49) were as injurious to Protestant Germany as the catastrophe of\r\nKappel had been to Reformed Switzerland. The tide of Reformation rolled\r\nback in Germany, and the men of Zurich beheld with grief and indignation\r\nthe fall of their strong ally in the work of religious reform,\r\nConstance, after its desperate stand against the Emperor, Charles V.\r\nZurich was prevented by internal dissension and Catholic intolerance\r\nfrom assisting Constance, and, moreover, was compelled to release\r\nMulhausen and Strasburg from their evangelical union with her. Thus\r\nGeneva, which the Papists threatened to level with the ground, was\r\nforced into an isolated position, and was near becoming the prey of\r\ninvading Savoy. Considering the internal condition of the Confederation,\r\nwe may well ask what it was that saved the little republic from complete\r\ndestruction in the terrible storm of the reaction which swept over\r\nEurope, if it was not the very strength of the Federal union, and the\r\ncommon possession of the different Swiss bailiwicks, which bound the\r\nparts so strongly together, and which triumphed over both party feelings\r\nand private interests. Thanks to the moderation of the Protestants, war\r\nwas avoided, and the country settled into a state of comparative repose.\r\nThrough Zwingli's efforts Switzerland extended the _droit d'asile_ to\r\nall, and she henceforward followed out her mission as a neutral power.\r\nIt is the protection so freely given to refugees by Geneva, Zurich, and\r\nother Swiss cities that brightens the history of this gloomy reaction\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nHenry II., anxious to win over Switzerland to the Catholic cause,\r\nrequested the Swiss to stand as sponsors to his daughter, Claudia, and\r\nreceived their embassy with marked distinction. Bern and Zurich,\r\nhowever, were not coaxed into an alliance with France by these\r\nblandishments. France wished for the preservation of peace from\r\nself-interest. But she extolled greatly the prowess of the Swiss, and\r\ncalled them the very \"marrow\" of her army. The Swiss excelled in single\r\nfeats of arms, and amongst the Catholic captains stands out\r\nconspicuously the valiant Ludwig von Pfyffer, of Lucerne, who played a\r\npart, as regards political influence, not unlike that of Waldmann, and\r\nwas nicknamed the \"Swiss King.\" The wealth he had hoarded up during his\r\nFrench service he freely spent in the Catholic cause.\r\n\r\nPre-eminent amongst those who worked for the Catholic revival was the\r\nfamous Carlo Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan, and nephew of Pius IV. He\r\nlived the life of a saint, and in due time was canonized. To his see\r\nbelonged the Swiss bailliages in the Ticino and Valtellina.\r\nIndefatigable in his labours, constantly visiting every part of his\r\ndiocese, toiling up to the Alpine huts, he gathered the scattered flocks\r\ninto the Papal fold, whether by mildness or by force. Shocked at the\r\nstate of religious matters in the Forest Cantons, he founded a seminary\r\nfor priests, to which Pfyffer at once gave a very large sum of money.\r\nFor the spread of Catholic doctrines he hit upon three different means.\r\nHe called into being the Collegium Helveticum in 1579 at Milan,[60]\r\nwhere the Swiss priests were educated free. He sent the Jesuits into the\r\ncountry, and placed a nuncio at Lucerne, in 1580. In 1586 was signed,\r\nbetween the seven Catholic cantons, the Borromean or Golden League,\r\ndirected against the reformers, and in the following year a coalition\r\nwas, by the same cantons, excepting Solothurn, entered into with Philip\r\nof Spain and with Savoy. The Jesuits settled themselves in Lucerne and\r\nFreiburg, and soon gained influence amongst the rich and the educated,\r\nwhilst the Capuchins, who fixed themselves at Altorf, Stanz, Appenzell,\r\nand elsewhere, won the hearts of the masses by their lowliness and\r\ndevotion. In this way did Rome seek to regain her influence over the\r\nSwiss peoples, and the effect of her policy was soon felt in the\r\nsemi-Protestant and subject lands. To the impression made by the efforts\r\nof the Capuchins the great dissension in Appenzell bears witness, the\r\ncanton actually breaking up into two hostile divisions. The Catholics\r\nremoved to Inner, and the Reformers to Outer Rhoden, and each managed\r\nits own affairs independently of the other; the latter, however, soon\r\nbegan to prosper more than the former. In the Valais, the Protestant\r\nparty, though strong, was quite swept out by the Jesuits, before 1630,\r\nand fled to Vaud and Bern. The history of lacerated Graubuenden will\r\noccupy the next chapter.\r\n\r\nIt is painful to read of an act of violence committed by the Papists in\r\nthe expulsion of the Evangelians from Locarno, in the winter of 1555,\r\nwhere a little band of two hundred adherents of the Zwinglian Church had\r\nformed round Beccaria. Zurich supported them, notwithstanding the\r\nopposition of France, and even of some of the Protestant cantons, and\r\nBullinger was their comfort and strength in all transactions. However,\r\nBeccaria was compelled to flee to Misox valley, whence he ministered by\r\nstealth to his flock. In January, 1555, stronger measures were taken,\r\nand men and women were driven over the snowy heights to Misox, a sorry\r\nsubstitute for the luxurious homes some of them had left in Locarno. But\r\nthey were soon moved on by the Papal legate, and in May some 120 of the\r\nband arrived at Zurich, where Bullinger had arranged for them a\r\nhospitable welcome. These new-comers revived the old trade with\r\nLombardy, and reintroduced the silk manufacture, which, being a\r\nmonopoly, became a source of great wealth to Zurich. Thus the town was\r\nrewarded for its hospitality. Some of the aristocratic Zurich families\r\nof to-day trace their origin to these Locarno refugees.\r\n\r\nThe city of Zurich was indeed at this time a general asylum for\r\nreligious refugees from all quarters. Germans, Italians, and English\r\nfled there, and especially the Marian exiles from England. We find Peter\r\nMartyr from Oxford established as a professor at the Carolinum; and\r\nOcchino as minister to the Italian congregation in Zurich; Socinus and\r\nother famous Italians.[61] Martyr and Socinus both died at Zurich, and\r\nlie buried in its minster. For several years Peter Martyr and Bullinger\r\nhad lived on terms of the closest friendship with each other, and their\r\nletters show how close was the tie between them. Their respective\r\nreligious views naturally tended to greater mutual resemblance.\r\nBullinger, like Calvin, kept up an immense correspondence with the\r\nreformed churches, and was in frequent communication with monarchs,\r\nprinces, powerful nobles, and learned doctors. The readers of the\r\npresent story will naturally feel most interest in the relation between\r\nthe Swiss and the English Churches, and it will perhaps be better to\r\nleave on one side the tangled skein of religious dissensions which\r\nagitated Europe, and show from authentic sources[62]--letters\r\nchiefly--how the Swiss Churches and Swiss divines influenced the\r\nReformed Church of England.\r\n\r\nThough the English Reformation under Henry VIII. was greatly influenced\r\nby Luther, under Edward VI. the Church veered round more to the Swiss\r\nviews, Cranmer especially leaning strongly towards Zwinglianism. Since\r\n1536 the prelate had been on most friendly terms with Bullinger, and in\r\nthis same year some young Englishmen, Butler, Udrof, and Partridge, by\r\nCranmer's desire, settled in Zurich, to study its religious aspect and\r\nenjoy intercourse with the distinguished Bullinger. In the following\r\nyear Eliot and others arrived with similar intent, and a great\r\nattachment sprang up between the young men and their spiritual guide.\r\nAt the request of the students, Bullinger addressed to Henry two\r\ntreatises on the \"Authority of the Scriptures,\" and on the \"Dignity and\r\nOffice of Bishops,\" respectively, and was afterwards told that the\r\ntreatises greatly interested both the king and the archbishop. \"It is\r\nincredible what fame you acquire in England by your writings,\" says\r\nEliot in his letter to Bullinger in 1539; \"the booksellers are growing\r\nrich through you.\" Under Edward VI., Bullinger's relations with Cranmer\r\nand Hooper, with Warwick and Dorset, and with Coxe and Cheke, grew\r\ncloser and closer, and the Church of Zurich regained its ascendency. At\r\nBullinger's house Hooper passed his second exile, and he says he was\r\nreceived with delight, \"being a true Christian,\" and he states that his\r\nfaith was greatly quickened by the writings of the famous Zurich divine.\r\nThe friendship between the two men was most intimate. At Hooper's\r\ndesire, Bullinger dedicated a series of his sermons on the \"Christian\r\nFaith\" to Edward, who was greatly delighted with them, and had them\r\ntranslated into English. During his imprisonment Hooper composed a\r\nremarkable treatise addressed to Parliament in defence of the Zwinglian\r\nteaching with regard to the Lord's Supper, and Traheron states (1548)\r\nthat England at large was inclined towards the Zwinglian view. In 1550\r\nKing Edward sent an envoy to ask the state of Zurich to unite with\r\nEngland with regard to a Church Council, and, curiously enough, with\r\nregard to reconciling that country with France.[63]\r\n\r\nA charming episode in the life of Bullinger was the springing up of the\r\nfriendship with Lady Jane Grey, then a young and studious girl of\r\nfourteen. Three letters written by her hand, and still treasured up at\r\nZurich, bear witness to this friendship. Of the treatise on \"Christian\r\nMarriage\" dedicated to her, she translated a portion into Greek, and\r\npresented it as a Christmas present to her father. Bullinger's sermons\r\nand letters were a delight to her, and were to her \"as most precious\r\nflowers from a garden.\" She asked his advice as to the best method of\r\nlearning Hebrew, and regarded him as particularly favoured by the grace\r\nof God. He it was whose teaching quickened her love for Christ, and gave\r\nher and her family such support in their great trials later on. Even at\r\nher last hour her thoughts were of him, for at the block she took off\r\nher gloves and desired that they should be sent on to her Swiss\r\nfriends.[64]\r\n\r\nIt was on the Continent, among the Reformed Churches, that Hooper and\r\nothers gained their taste for a simple form of religious worship. When\r\nHooper was made Bishop of Gloucester, in 1550, he refused both the oath\r\nand the episcopal vestments, and was sent to prison for his refusal. His\r\nopposition, indeed, sowed the germs of that religious development which\r\nso strongly agitated the Church under Elizabeth, and which, breaking\r\ninto open schism, resulted in the rise of Puritanism, and, later on, of\r\nthe dissenting movements generally. And, as is well known, the Puritans\r\nfled to New England rather than give up their religious liberty. Hooper\r\nwas exempted from taking the oath, but had to give way in the matter of\r\nthe vestments. During his episcopacy Bullinger was ever his faithful and\r\nwise counsellor, and when the martyr's death overtook him, he\r\nrecommended his persecuted country to his Swiss friends. \"Of all men\r\nattached to thee,\" he assures Bullinger in 1554, \"none has been more\r\ndevoted than myself, nor have I ever had a more sincere friend than\r\nthee.\"\r\n\r\nMany other Marian exiles settled in Zurich, to whom, however, only a\r\npassing word can be devoted. Bullinger alone accommodated often as many\r\nas twenty guests at a time, and both ministers and magistrates--Gualter,\r\nLavater, and others--received the English exiles \"with a tenderness and\r\naffection that engaged them to the end of their lives to make the\r\ngreatest possible acknowledgment for it,\" to quote the words of one\r\nEnglishman. The correspondence between the Swiss hosts and their English\r\nguests proves how close were the friendships formed between them.\r\nAmongst these correspondents we find the English archbishops, Grindal\r\nand Sandys, Bishop Pilkington, the Earl of Bedford, and other notable\r\nmen. Other proofs without number might be given of the close connection\r\nbetween Switzerland and England in religious matters in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, but what has been said must suffice.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to show how the influence of the Reformed Swiss\r\nChurches was brought to bear on English Protestantism; on the Anglican\r\nChurch in respect of doctrine; and on the dissenting Church, that is,\r\nPuritanism, in respect of both doctrine and form of worship. The\r\nReformed Church is the result of an amalgamation between the two mother\r\nChurches of Geneva and Zurich, the union being brought about by the\r\ndesire of the leaders Calvin, Farel, Beza, Bullinger, who, anxious for\r\npeace and concord, made mutual concessions.[65] Thus in Switzerland the\r\nnarrowness of Calvinism has been tempered by an admixture of the broader\r\nand more enlightened teachings of Zwinglius, or rather the basis of the\r\nteaching is Zwingli's, and Calvin has confirmed, intensified, and\r\ncompleted it. Over France, England, Scotland, Holland, and North America\r\nthe reformed faith spread its roots \"to grow up to trees of the same\r\nfamily, but of different shape and size according to the soil from which\r\nthey started up.\" That Switzerland, with the exception of Geneva,\r\ninclined strongly to Zwinglianism we have already shown. To deal\r\nadequately with the question of the religious influence of Switzerland\r\non other European countries would be impossible within the limits of\r\nthis work. But that its influence was very great needs no saying. And\r\nnot in Europe alone, for the Puritan spirit was carried beyond the\r\nocean, and the reformers of Switzerland had their disciples in far-away\r\nNew England. Even modern Unitarianism is, in a sense, the direct\r\ndescendant of the reformation of Zurich, and its apostles--Williams,\r\nChanning, Parker--are so far the successors of Zwingli and Bullinger.\r\n\r\nThe revival of learning witnessed by the sixteenth century had its full\r\neffect in Switzerland. The thirst for knowledge was so great that men\r\nwould undergo almost any privations in their pursuit of it. Thomas\r\nPlatter--to cite but one instance out of many--rose from the humble\r\nposition of goatherd to be a prominent master of Hebrew and the classics\r\nat Basel. In early life he laboured at rope-making, or turned\r\nserving-man, or even begged in the streets. His son Felix was a notable\r\nphysician. The great reformers have already been spoken of. Besides the\r\nabove,[66] we may just mention among the Catholics, Glarean, the\r\nforemost classical scholar of his country, crowned poet-laureate by the\r\nEmperor Max. I.; and Tschudi, of Glarus, the brilliant narrator, author\r\nof the national epic, Tell, and for centuries the first authority on\r\nSwiss history; Paracelsus of Einsiedeln: of Protestants, Manuel (Bern),\r\nthe satirical poet, and painter of the _Todten Taenze a la Holbein_; and,\r\nabove all, Gessner, of Zurich, scholar, philosopher, naturalist, the\r\n\"Pliny of Germany.\"\r\n\r\n_Kleinkunst_, lesser or practical art, also made brilliant progress in\r\nSwitzerland. Painting on glass, wood-carving, manufacture of\r\npainted-tile stoves developed into industries almost peculiar to the\r\ncountry in their excellence. This is shown by an inspection of the\r\nmagnificent specimens of these arts with which the country\r\nabounds--splendid painted windows, beautiful wainscots, exquisite\r\nrelievi, beautiful tiled stoves, and so forth.\r\n\r\nA few words respecting affairs in Geneva must close our account of the\r\nsixteenth century. The Dukes of Savoy, unwilling to renounce their\r\nclaims, continued to harass the city. Henry IV., of France, came forward\r\nas a protector, and Elizabeth, of England, addressed to the Swiss\r\ncantons and reformed cities letters remarkable for the noble sentiments\r\nand clear judgment displayed in them.[67] She urged them not to throw\r\naway the key of Switzerland. However, on the night of the 21st of\r\nDecember, 1602, Duke Charles Emmanuel ventured on a treacherous _coup de\r\nmain_ on the city known as the famous \"Escalade.\" Eight thousand men had\r\nbeen drawn up before her gates, and some three hundred had already\r\nscaled her walls, when the sudden firing by a watchful guard roused the\r\ncitizens to a sense of their danger. A fierce conflict took place in the\r\nstreets, and the intruders were fortunately overpowered. This event\r\ncaused the greatest indignation throughout Europe, but it sealed the\r\nindependence of the Republic. The anniversary of the victory is still\r\nregarded by the Genevans.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[60] This still exists in connection with the episcopal seminary.\r\n\r\n[61] Faustus Socinus, the nephew of this Laelius Socinus, formed into a\r\nregular system the ideas of his uncle, and really prepared the way for\r\nmodern Unitarianism.\r\n\r\n[62] The Zurich archives are remarkably rich in materials relating to\r\nthe Reformation period. The Simmler collection contains copies of\r\neighteen thousand authentic letters. The \"Epistolae Tigurinae,\" published\r\nby the Parker Society, London, in 1842, contain copies of original\r\nletters from the Marian exiles to Zurich divines. At Zurich are\r\npreserved original letters from Erasmus, Henry the Fourth of France,\r\nLady Jane Grey, &c.\r\n\r\n[63] Pestalozzi's \"Life of Bullinger,\" Zurich.\r\n\r\n[64] Pestalozzi's \"Life of Bullinger.\"\r\n\r\n[65] In England the general name Calvinistic is applied to certain\r\ndoctrines of the Reformed Churches, but not altogether appropriately,\r\nseeing that Calvin was only one of the teachers of these doctrines.\r\n\r\n[66] Glarean and Tschudi were Catholics, Manuel a Protestant.\r\n\r\n[67] Copies are preserved among the Zurich letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE ARISTOCRATIC PERIOD.\r\n\r\n(1600-1712.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the life of nations no less than of individuals there are\r\nvicissitudes, alternations of prosperity and adversity. If the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries witnessed the glorious rise of the\r\nSwiss people, the seventeenth and eighteenth saw the political decline\r\nof the Republic. Even the Reformation itself led the way to this decline\r\nby lodging all power--political, fiscal, moral, and educational--in the\r\nProtestant cantons in the hands of the governments. Patriotism was on\r\nthe wane, and the old mania for foreign service as a means of securing\r\nforeign gold was again breaking out. Even Zurich, which for well-nigh a\r\ncentury had steadfastly borne in mind the patriotic maxims of Zwingli,\r\nnow yielded to the persuasions of France. Indeed the Swiss Commonwealth\r\nwas rapidly becoming a mere vassalate of that country, under the\r\ndespotic Louis XIV. Swiss rule was taking that tinge of absolutism which\r\nwas colouring the governments of almost all European states. Louis, the\r\npersonification of absolute rule, had stamped the century with his\r\n_cachet_, and aristocracies and oligarchies were taking the place of the\r\nold democratic governments. This seems incompatible with the old Swiss\r\nrepublican tenets. Yet, drawn within the influence of the monarchical\r\nstates, how could Switzerland escape the effects of that influence any\r\nmore than Venice or Genoa?\r\n\r\nThe political and religious passions and animosities of the previous\r\ncentury now found vent in the terrible Thirty Years' War, which from\r\n1618 to 1648 convulsed Europe. Thanks to its good fortune and\r\nfar-sightedness, Switzerland was not drawn into the conflict, save as to\r\nits south-eastern corner, close as it was to the theatre of the great\r\nstruggle. Most anxiously was the neutrality of the country maintained,\r\nyet its territory was not unfrequently violated. To give one instance,\r\nGeneral Horn led his Swedes into Swiss territory to besiege Constance.\r\nGermany and Sweden--Gustavus Adolphus especially[68]--did all they could\r\nto draw Switzerland to their side, but the Swiss had the good sense to\r\nresist all blandishments, and bear patiently with vexatious intrusions.\r\nThe terrible scenes that were taking place across the Rhine were enough\r\nto quell all intestine disputes in Switzerland itself, and the\r\ncomparative peace and prosperity found within its borders was the envy\r\nof the neighbouring lands. A German traveller chronicles his surprise at\r\nfinding in Switzerland neither rapine nor murder, but security and\r\ncontent. However rough and rugged its surface, the little republic\r\nseemed to him an earthly Paradise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIGH ALTAR, CHUR CATHEDRAL.\r\n\r\n(_From a Photograph._)]\r\n\r\nDifferent, however, was the experience of Graubuenden, then a separate\r\nfree state, and a connection only of the Confederation. In truth, the\r\nhistory of that old Rhaetian land at that time forms a striking pendant\r\nas it were to the great drama of the European struggle. The Latin-German\r\ninhabitants, combining northern prudence with southern passion, had\r\nsince the middle of the sixteenth century been steeped in internal\r\ndissension, owing to the religious divisions caused by the Reformation.\r\nThe Protestant party under Von Salis, and the Catholics headed by Von\r\nPlanta, were at deadly enmity with each other, and sided with France and\r\nVenice, and with Austria and Spain respectively. John von Planta, head\r\nof his clan, and solicitor-general of the Papal see, was suspected of\r\nintending to reintroduce Popery into the Grisons. The mountaineers\r\naccordingly descended from their Alps in crowds, and flocked to Chur.\r\nThere they brought to trial Planta and sentenced him to death, and his\r\nfall struck the keynote to the tragedy that followed. With the opening\r\nof the seventeenth century the conflict grew fiercer, national interests\r\nand foreign policy being now inextricably mixed. Mistress of the\r\nbeautiful Italian Signory Valtellina, Bormio, Chiavenna, and the Alpine\r\npasses commanding the entrance into the Tyrol and Italy, Graubuenden\r\nbecame the apple of contention between the southern states of Europe.\r\nAustria and Spain possessing Milan were not without hopes of joining\r\nhands across Graubuenden, and France was sanguine of her success in\r\npreventing it. This latter state with Venice had effected an alliance\r\nwith Protestant Buenden, and that party strongly opposed the Spanish\r\nunion for which the energetic but headstrong Rudolf von Planta was\r\nworking. Fuentes, a Spaniard, Governor of Milan, furious at the\r\nresistance offered, erected a chain of strong forts on Lake Como, with\r\nthe view of cutting off the Valtellines. Before long, George Jenatsch\r\nfrom the Engadine, Tschusch, and other high-minded and patriotic\r\nProtestants, began to decry the Spanish scheme, and tumults arose. An\r\nattack on Planta's manor, Zernez (1618), having failed through the\r\nescape of Rudolf, Zambra, Landammann in Bregaglia, and Rusca, a priest\r\nin the Valtellina, both greyheaded old men, were seized. They were\r\nsentenced to death by a new court which had been set up at Thusis, a\r\ncourt which raged against popery and spread terrorism for some months.\r\nIn the Engadine a strange thing happened. The respective chiefs of the\r\nhostile clans were the two brothers Von Travers, and a hand-to-hand\r\nfight between the opposing parties having begun, suddenly the wives,\r\ndaughters, and sisters of the combatants rushed amongst them like the\r\nSabine women of old, and checked them. Foremost amongst these noble\r\nwomen was the spirited Anna Juvalta. The Plantas were now in exile, and\r\nwere conspiring with Austria. Their cousin Robustello (Valtellina) at a\r\ngiven signal broke into the houses of the Protestants, and, with the\r\nhelp of hired assassins, put the inmates to the sword. This was on the\r\n19th of July, 1620, and throughout the whole valley no quarter was\r\ngiven. Zurich and Bern on hearing of this shocking massacre--the \"St.\r\nBartholomew of the Valtellina\"--sent troops, but they were defeated at\r\nTirano by the Spanish forces and adherents. The Plantas returned from\r\nexile and asked the Forest Cantons to give their countenance to their\r\nparty, and these were not unwilling; but the plot itself was opposed by\r\nthe Protestant Grisons with scorn and fury. Jenatsch penetrated to the\r\ncastle of the Plantas at Rietberg, and Pompejus fell by his hands\r\n(1621). The Catholics were defeated at Valendas, and the country was\r\ncleared of the troops of the Forest Cantons and of Spaniards. However,\r\nJenatsch failed to take Valtellina.\r\n\r\nThe Austrians still claimed supremacy over part of the\r\n_Zehngerichte_,[69] and we find them, from 1620 to 1629, twice invading\r\nand occupying Graubuenden. The most dreadful cruelties marked the passage\r\nof their general, Baldiron, and Catholicism was reintroduced by force.\r\nIn 1629, the Emperor Ferdinand had reached the height of his success and\r\ngreatness, and Buenden with all its dependencies lay prostrate at his\r\nfeet. France came to the rescue. Richelieu pursued the policy of Henry\r\nIV. to re-establish the balance of power by breaking down the prestige\r\nof the Habsburgs. With the view of gaining supremacy for France, he had\r\ndrawn Sweden into the Thirty Years' War; and on the death of Gustavus\r\nAdolphus, when the zeal was somewhat flagging, he revived it by sending\r\nFrench troops into Alsace, South Germany, and the Grisons. The command\r\nof the Franco-Grison army was entrusted to Duke Henry de Rohan, godson\r\nof Henry IV. of France (and godfather to Charles I. of England), one of\r\nthe noblest characters of his age. De Rohan was also appointed\r\nambassador to the Eidgenossen states in 1631. He had been leader of the\r\nHuguenots, and had supported the Edict of Nantes in opposition to Louis\r\nXIII. Becoming obnoxious to the king in consequence, he withdrew to\r\nVenice. There he wrote a treatise on the strategical importance of the\r\nGrisons, as if he foresaw his future mission.[70] During his residence\r\nin Switzerland he watched zealously over its interests, smoothing over\r\ndifficulties in the Diet to avoid war. Richelieu sent him neither money\r\nnor help, but left him to extricate himself as best he could from his\r\nposition in that isolated mountain fastness; yet Rohan was the idol of\r\nhis soldiers and of the people of the Grisons, and was always spoken of\r\nby them as the \"good duke.\" In 1635, when France was doing its utmost to\r\noust Austria, open war broke out, and Rohan gained four brilliant\r\nvictories in succession--Jenatsch serving as local guide and combatant\r\nin advance, his superior tactics proving too much for the Austro-Spanish\r\nforces. Yet the \"good duke\" was soon to fall a victim to the perfidious\r\npolicy of Richelieu, and the treachery of Jenatsch. This latter was a\r\nstrange mixture of the noble and the vile--fierce, and ambitious, a\r\nseeker of gain, yet a man of honour, full of a wild patriotism and\r\nthirst for freedom. Eager to free his country from the grasp of the\r\nstranger, he and the hot-tempered Buendner, at whose head he was,\r\nsuddenly found that they were but exchanging masters. Sticking at\r\nnothing to gain his ends Jenatsch entered into a secret understanding\r\nwith Austria and Spain, and even turned Catholic to win more favour with\r\nthem. Then, forgetting the many kindnesses he had received from his\r\nfriend Rohan, he betrayed him to his enemies. It should be observed,\r\nparenthetically, that the question in dispute was that of the\r\nValtellina, and Rohan had had no instructions from Richelieu to return\r\nthat territory. Suddenly the French general found himself surrounded by\r\nhostile troops from the Grisons, and was compelled to capitulate (1637).\r\nUnable to bear the sight of France again, he fought for her under the\r\nbanner of Bernhard von Weimar, and fell at Rheinfelden, in Aargovy,\r\nseeking rather than fearing death. Jenatsch, however, did not long enjoy\r\nthe fruits of his guilty action. Two years later he was stabbed at an\r\nofficers' banquet, during the carnival, by some masked figure. Rudolf\r\nPlanta, son of Pompejus, was said by some to have done the deed, whilst\r\nanother story has it that the avenger was Rudolf's sister, Lucretia, who\r\nwas burning for vengeance on the slayer of her father.[71] One of the\r\nfirst German novelists of our time, Ferdinand Meyer, of Zurich, has\r\nworked these thrilling episodes into his fine story, \"Jenatsch.\" The\r\nhero was buried with pomp at Chur, but his murderer remained\r\nunpunished. Thus Graubuenden, after a struggle of nearly a hundred years,\r\nrecovered both its independence and its lost territory.\r\n\r\nThat memorable event of the seventeenth century, the signing of the\r\nPeace of Westphalia, which concluded the Thirty Years' War, whilst, on\r\nthe one hand, it sanctioned the dismemberment of the German Empire, yet\r\nratified the independence and autonomy of the Swiss republics. This\r\nresult was chiefly due to the noble efforts of two men--Wettstein,\r\nBurgomaster of Basel, who most effectively championed Swiss interests at\r\nthe Congress; and Henry d'Orleans Longueville, count and reigning prince\r\nof Neuchatel, the French representative at the same conference, who\r\nsupported the Swiss claims.\r\n\r\nThe religious strife of Villmergen in 1656, which ended in the defeat of\r\nthe Protestants, cannot be gone into here. Suffice it to note that this\r\ndefeat was fully repaired by the second war of that name in 1712. A more\r\nimportant matter was the Peasants' Revolt, in 1653. It promised to grow\r\nto alarming dimensions, but was put down by the Government. This rising,\r\nhowever, is noteworthy, as marking the vast chasm which had formed\r\nbetween the labouring and the governing classes. The peasantry were now\r\nin a state of complete subjection, and patiently awaited the dawn of a\r\nbrighter day, which nevertheless came only with the French Revolution.\r\nWhat they claimed was the restoration of their old liberties, relief\r\nfrom the excessive taxation, and the general improvement of their\r\nmaterial interests. But many of the governing classes, councillors,\r\n_landvoegte_, and others, had served abroad at foreign courts, and had\r\ndrunk in the spirit of absolutism, and were as much imbued as any James\r\nI. or Louis XIV. with notions as to the \"divine right\" of the privileged\r\nclasses to govern. They claimed seats on the administration as a right.\r\nFrom their superior positions they looked down on the labouring classes,\r\nand had little or no sympathy with them. Except in name the Swiss\r\ncantons were as absolutely governed by aristocracies as France was by\r\nLouis XIV. Nothing is more ludicrous, or more clearly shows the\r\naffectations and narrow pedantries of the age, than the childish delight\r\nin long or high-flown titles, by which the Swiss \"regents,\" as they were\r\ncalled, were wont to address each other, and be addressed even by\r\nforeigners. \"Leurs excellences,\" \"noble-born,\" and so forth, were as\r\ncommon amongst Swiss republicans as in any monarchy.[72] Nor were they\r\nbehindhand in the adoption of court fashions, wigs, frills, and the\r\nlike; whilst they hunted eagerly for patents of nobility, and placed the\r\n\"von\" so unblushingly before their names that the higher classes, and\r\nreally well-born for the most part dropped it for a time.\r\n\r\nThe Eidgenossen, however, were eminently useful soldiers, and Louis XIV.\r\nin 1663 wheedled or tricked them into the renewal of the alliance with\r\nFrance, an alliance into which Le Barde had tried in vain for thirteen\r\nyears to coax them. The wily Louis invited a Swiss embassy to his Court,\r\nand for a whole week amused and flattered his guests with a succession\r\nof banquets, ceremonies, and entertainments. Moliere played before them\r\nby royal command. The ambassadors were thus beguiled into admitting some\r\nof the most important points in the treaty, the neutrality of Burgundy,\r\nthe liquidation of the old debt, &c. On the 18th of November, in the\r\npresence of the whole French Court, at Notre Dame, the Swiss\r\nrepresentatives agreed to a disgraceful and humiliating bargain with\r\nLouis. The king was not, however, inclined to lavish money on them like\r\nhis predecessors had done. One day Louvois complained to him that his\r\nSwiss troops stood him dear, that for the money they had cost him and\r\nhis predecessors the road could be paved with crown-pieces from Paris to\r\nBasel. Stuppa from the Grisons, overhearing this, quickly retorted,\r\n\"Sir, you forget that with the Swiss blood spilt in the French service\r\nyou might fill a canal from Basel to Paris.\"\r\n\r\nDespite the engagements to France which Switzerland had entered into, it\r\nnever ceased to give shelter to the French refugees who fled to escape\r\nthe persecutions of Louis--to the Waldenses and the Huguenots. After the\r\nrevocation of the Edict of Nantes, sixty-six thousand emigrants are said\r\nto have found shelter in Switzerland. Amongst the Swiss cities Geneva\r\nstands out conspicuously and honourably by her great benevolence. Not to\r\nspeak of the vast amount of private assistance given, the municipality\r\nspent on the relief of the religious refugees no less a sum than five\r\nmillion florins between 1685 and 1726. Gradually the Eidgenossen became\r\nalive to the real character of Louis and his negotiations with them,\r\nand ashamed of their own lack of patriotism. As early as 1689, indeed,\r\nwe find Swiss envoys from Bern and Zurich at Paris, rejecting his\r\nbribes, his golden chains, and what not. And on their return home they\r\nreceived the eulogies of their people for their integrity and\r\nindependence. Gradually the league with France was set aside, or\r\nignored. Nevertheless, the system of mercenary service remained an\r\nevil--one may say a cancerous evil--in the Swiss policy of the later\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[68] Appealing to the absurd pretended national relationship between\r\nSwedes and Switzers, an etymology of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n[69] See the chapter on the Swabian wars.\r\n\r\n[70] Rohan was a great friend to Zurich, and presented to its city\r\nlibrary which was then forming his \"Parfait Capitaine,\" a Hebrew Bible,\r\nand his portrait. He was by his own request buried at Geneva, and his\r\ndeath was greatly regretted by the reformed cities. The letters written\r\nby his family in reply to the \"Condolence of Zurich\" are still preserved\r\nin the library. See pamphlet on Rohan by Professor von Wyss.\r\n\r\n[71] In Meyer's novel, Lucretia is betrothed to Jenatsch and takes the\r\nveil after the murder of Jenatsch, but this story has no foundation in\r\nfact.\r\n\r\n[72] A few of these magnificent titles, or epithets, may be noted:\r\n\"Hoch,\" \"Wohlgeachtete,\" \"Edle,\" \"Fromme,\" \"Fuersichtige,\" \"Fuernehme,\"\r\n\"Weise Herren,\" and many more such like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL MATTERS IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolitically Switzerland presents much the same aspect in the eighteenth\r\nas in the previous century, and it needs here only a few words to\r\nindicate more clearly the temper of the times. In Swiss lands, as\r\nelsewhere, we have the inevitable division into the two classes of\r\ngovernor and governed. The rank and file of the \"reigning families,\"\r\n_regiments-faehig_, patricians or plutocrats, rigorously kept all power\r\nto themselves, and held sway over the ordinary burghers and common folk.\r\nUnchecked rule and superiority and a life of ease and luxury on the one\r\nside; blind submission and toil on the other, especially in the rural\r\ndistricts. Even in the professedly democratic cantons the same despotism\r\nis met with; chieftains and family \"dynasts\" seizing the reins of\r\ngovernment, and overruling the _landsgemeinde_, whilst they contend with\r\neach other for supremacy. Just as in the case of the oligarchies, the\r\n_laender_ make the most of their \"divine right\" to govern. No wonder\r\nrisings took place, as that of the Leventines against the harsh\r\n_landvoegte_ of Uri, and that of the Werdenberger (St. Gall) against\r\nGlarus, though these revolts were in vain. In Zurich, Schaffhausen, and\r\nBasel, there was less oppression, the guilds keeping the nobility at\r\nbay, though this guild system itself was not without blemish. The chief\r\ncities or cantonal _chefs-lieux_ one and all held sovereign sway over\r\nthe country districts attaching to them, but, like the old nobility of\r\nFrance, shifted off their own shoulders nearly all taxation, whilst they\r\nmonopolized trade and industry. Thus the peasantry were crushed with the\r\nweight of taxes, imposts, tithes, and what not.\r\n\r\nReligious differences had deepened since the second war of Villmergen\r\n(1712), which had brought the Protestants to the fore, and had\r\nestablished the principle of religious equality. The Catholics, having\r\nlost their supremacy in certain bailiwicks or subject districts, began\r\nto dream of regaining their lost position. To this end they entered into\r\na secret agreement (_ligue a la cassette_) with Louis XIV. of France\r\nshortly before that monarch's death. It was not till 1777, however, that\r\nFrance really gained her point. In that year the common fear of Austria\r\ninduced both Protestants and Catholics to enter into a league with Louis\r\nXVI. Thus, for the first time since the Reformation, the Confederates\r\nwere a united body, or at any rate were agreed as to their joint plan of\r\naction.\r\n\r\nInteresting though the task might be, it is here impossible to\r\ninvestigate the various conditions of the government in the subject\r\nlands--Aargau, Thurgau, Ticino, Vaud, part of St. Gall, portions gained\r\nby conquest, or fragments acquired by purchase. We should meet with\r\ncurious remnants of feudalism, and strange mixtures of the mediaeval and\r\nthe modern. But our space will permit of only a glance. The subject\r\nlands were deprived of all self-government, and the _landvoegte_ ruled\r\nthem as an Eastern satrap might rule his satrapy. A somewhat strange\r\narrangement for a republic to make and allow; but yet, on the whole, the\r\ngovernment was excellent, and this state of things continued for a long\r\nperiod. Abuses, bribery, extortions, and the like of course crept in,\r\nbut it is to be remembered that the _landvoegte_ were strictly controlled\r\nby the central government.[73] Many of them, especially at Bern, kept up\r\nmuch state; possessed horses, carriages, and livery-servants, and kept\r\nopen house. In their lordships they ruled as veritable sovereigns, but\r\nthey cared for their people, as good sovereigns should. They were,\r\nindeed, more like the patriarchs of old, rewarding or admonishing their\r\npeoples as circumstances required. One specimen of the class was greatly\r\nadmired by Goethe, viz., Landvogt Landolt von Greifensee (Zurich). A few\r\ntraits will serve to mark the man and the system. This governor was of\r\nthe old school, and hated enlightened peasants and modern revolutionary\r\nideas. He advocated compulsory attendance at church, and firmly believed\r\nin flogging as the most rational form of punishment. On the other hand,\r\nhe was both benevolent and humane, and watched over his people with a\r\nfatherly care. He was equally anxious to improve their farms and their\r\nmorals. He was wont to go about _incognito_--generally dressed as a\r\nTyrolese--and visited the printshops to find out the gamblers and the\r\ndrunkards. The latter he had put into a revolving cage till they got\r\nsober. Quarrelling couples he shut up together, and forced them to eat\r\n_with the same spoon_![74] But among many subject lands the system had\r\ngreatly changed.\r\n\r\nThe greatest holder of subject territory was Bern, with its forty-four\r\nlordships or bailiwicks, Zurich coming next with twenty-nine. The\r\nlargest subject district was Vaud, and, thanks to its thriving\r\nagriculture, and the wise, though harsh, administration of Bern, it\r\nflourished greatly. The Vaudois had on the whole submitted quietly to\r\nBernese rule, though the upper classes amongst them did not relish their\r\nexclusion from the conduct of State affairs. However, bowing to the\r\ninevitable, they gave themselves up to the enjoyment of a life of\r\npleasure and to intellectual pursuits. About this time Lausanne, their\r\ncapital, had become the resort of men like Gibbon, Fox, Raynal,\r\nVoltaire, and many men of lesser mark. They were attracted by the beauty\r\nof the scenery and by the high repute of the Vaud gentry for good\r\nbreeding and affability. These noble families opened their salons to the\r\ndistinguished foreigners who resided among them, and Gibbon seems to\r\nhave particularly appreciated their good qualities.[75] The historian\r\nspent much of his life at Lausanne. An unlucky attempt had been made by\r\nMajor Davel, in 1723, to rescue Vaud from the grasp of Bern. This\r\nenthusiastic patriot had himself concocted the plot, and attempted to\r\ncarry out his plans without informing a single person of his intentions.\r\nMustering his men, Davel, on some pretence, led them to Lausanne, where\r\nthe council were then sitting, the _landvoegte_ being up at Bern, and\r\ninformed the board what he proposed to do. But the members of the\r\ncouncil were not yet prepared to seek emancipation, and, simulating an\r\nunderstanding, betrayed the luckless patriot to the Bernese authorities.\r\n\"Leurs Excellences\"--such was the official title of the Bernese\r\nrulers--made use of the rack, with the object of extorting from him the\r\nnames of his accomplices, but in vain, and he was beheaded.\r\n\r\nAmongst the leading cities of the Confederation, Zurich was conspicuous\r\nas the centre of Liberal tendencies and intellectual progress, whilst\r\nBern was the political centre, and the leading financial focus.[76] Like\r\na modern Rothschild, Bern then lent to various European states. Part of\r\nher treasure went towards paying the cost of Napoleon's expedition to\r\nEgypt. Among her sister cities, Freiburg, Solothurn, and Lucerne, Bern\r\npresented the most perfect example of an oligarchy, admired by\r\nMontesquieu, Napoleon, and even Rousseau. Her decided bent was for\r\ndiplomacy, and she was completely absorbed in rule and administration,\r\nand she had few other tastes. Trade and industry she considered beneath\r\nher dignity; even literary pursuits to a great extent. The Bernese\r\naristocrats were politicians from birth, so to speak, and the young men\r\nhad a curious society amongst themselves, \"Aeusserer Stand,\" a society\r\nformed for the purpose of cultivating the diplomatic art and practising\r\nparliamentary oratory and tactics, especially their more formal outward\r\nside. Thus trained in bearing and ceremonial they acquired their\r\nmuch-admired political _aplomb_. Bern was French in fashion, in manners,\r\nand in language, and the German tongue was as little appreciated amongst\r\nthe Bernese patricians as at the Court of Frederick the Great. The\r\nconstitution presents some features quite unique in their way. There was\r\nan exclusiveness which has lasted in all its force even down to our own\r\ndays; and three classes of society sprang up, as widely separated from\r\neach other as the different castes in India. All power was vested in the\r\n360 \"reigning families\"; the number of these was at length, by death and\r\nclever manipulating, reduced to eighty, and even fewer. From these\r\nfamilies alone were the councils selected, and to the members of these\r\nonly were governorships assigned. If male heirs were wanting, then the\r\nseats on the council were given to the daughters as dowries. So\r\nexclusive was this governing body, that even Haller, the great poet, was\r\nnot allowed to enter it. The class next lower in rank was that of the\r\nburghers, _ewige habitanten_, with no political rights, and with not a\r\nvestige of power in the commonwealth. They were not allowed to hold\r\nofficerships abroad, but trade, industry, and the schools and churches\r\nwere theirs. Lastly came the Ansaessige (settlers), the proletariat,\r\nincluding the country labourers, foreigners, refugees, and commoner folk\r\ngenerally. Many were their disabilities; they were not permitted to buy\r\nhouses, to have their children baptised in the city, to have tombstones\r\nset up over the graves of members of their family.[77] They might not\r\neven appear in the market till their betters had done their business,\r\nviz., 11 a.m., and they were strictly forbidden to carry baskets in the\r\narchways (_les arcades de la ville_), in order that these should not\r\ndamage the hooped petticoats of the patrician ladies.[78] Bern has often\r\nbeen compared with ancient Rome, and certainly its stern council\r\nsomewhat resembles in its austerity, solemnity, and pomp the august\r\nRoman Senate. It is not surprising that many attempts should have been\r\nmade to induce the Government to relax its severity. In 1744 certain\r\ncitizens petitioned the council to that effect, but were banished for\r\ntheir pains. Five years later a famous man named Henzi, with several\r\nassociates, formed a plot against the council, but they were detected\r\nand executed.\r\n\r\nBut in truth there were risings in almost every one of the cantons. Of\r\nthese only the most remarkable can be touched on here, those of Geneva.\r\nThese are real constitutional struggles, and, indeed, form the\r\npreliminaries in their way to the French Revolution, on which indeed\r\ntheir history sheds no little light. These troubles in Geneva are not\r\nunlike those of the Gracchi period in Roman history. By the Constitution\r\nof 1536 Geneva had been granted the right of a \"Conseil General,\" but\r\nthis council had never been allowed to act or meet. The patricians who\r\noccupied the _haut de la cite_ had arrogated to themselves well-nigh all\r\npower. But as early as 1707, the burghers, ever on the alert to regain\r\ntheir liberties, rose with the view of re-establishing the General\r\nCouncil of 1536. The movement was headed by the generous and\r\nnoble-minded Pierre Fatio, himself a patrician. In fiery speeches, made\r\nin the open places of the town, he championed the popular rights,\r\nasserting with vehemence that the rulers were not the masters and tutors\r\nof the people, but the executors of its sovereign will. The attempt to\r\ngain popular liberty miscarried, Fatio was shot in prison, and his\r\nfollowers were exiled. Yet Fatio's idea lived on amongst the working\r\nclasses, and later were again advocated in the pamphlets of Micheli du\r\nCrest. In the years 1734 and 1737 the insurrections burst out afresh,\r\nand resulted in the establishment of the Constitution of 1738, which\r\nsecured for a quarter of a century a happiness it had never before\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nHowever, the second half of the century witnessed new troubles between\r\nthe burghers and the patricians. These latter were called, by way of\r\nnickname, \"Negatifs,\" because they denied the people reform, whilst the\r\nburghers were styled \"Representants,\" because they presented petitions\r\nfor political liberty. The artizan class were nicknamed \"Natifs.\" It is\r\nimpossible here to follow closely these \"tea-cup squabbles,\" as Voltaire\r\ncalled them, but the philosopher's sympathies were with the _haut de la\r\nville_, while Rousseau, on the contrary, sided with the _bas de la\r\nville_.\r\n\r\nOf all the Swiss lands the most equitable and righteous government was\r\nthat enjoyed by Neuchatel, under Frederick the Great (1740-1786). This\r\nstate had of its own free will in 1707 accepted the ducal sway of the\r\nkings of Prussia, in order to escape the grasp of Louis XIV. At one\r\ntime, however, Frederick II. so far forgot himself as to infringe the\r\n\"states'\" right of taxation, and the semi-republican duchy at once rose\r\nin rebellion. Gaudot, the vice-governor, Frederick's devoted minister,\r\nwas shot in the fray (1768). Yet, thanks to the monarch's wise\r\nmoderation, and the intervention of the Swiss Confederation, the storm\r\nwas calmed, and Neuchatel continued in her peaceful and happy condition.\r\nIt is clear that there was in Switzerland plenty of combustible matter,\r\nneeding only the French Revolution to raise a conflagration.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[73] The unrighteous and cruel Landvogt Tscharner was punished with\r\ndeath by the Bernese Government in 1612.\r\n\r\n[74] For further particulars about this original man the reader is\r\nreferred to the charming novel bearing his name, by Keller (Keller's\r\n\"Zurcher Novellen\").\r\n\r\n[75] Madame de la Charriere, the novelist, writes: \"Nous vivons avec\r\neux, nous leur plaisons, quelquefois nous les formons, et ils nous\r\ngatent.\"\r\n\r\n[76] The Bernese peasantry had attained unusual wealth by its excellent\r\nmanagement and the strict administration of its government.\r\n\r\n[77] Prof. Voegelin, \"Schweizergeschichte,\" p. 344.\r\n\r\n[78] See \"Die Patrizierin,\" a recent fascinating novel by Widmann, a\r\nBernese writer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII.\r\n\r\nSWITZERLAND AND THE RENAISSANCE. INFLUENCE OF VOLTAIRE AND ROUSSEAU.\r\n\r\n\r\nBarren and uninviting is the waste of politics in Switzerland at this\r\nperiod of our story, and it seemed as if the republic was quietly\r\ncrumbling out of active existence. But the literary and scientific\r\nrenaissance runs through it all like a fertilizing stream, and saves it\r\nfrom utter sterility. Feeble though it was politically, Switzerland yet\r\nproduced on all sides men of mark in science, in literature, in\r\nphilosophy. Time would fail to tell of them all, and we must be content\r\nto follow briefly the three great currents of the movement, which\r\ncentred respectively around Geneva, Zurich, and the Helvetic Society.\r\nThe two former of these may indeed be said to form a part (and an\r\nimportant part) of the great general awakening of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, an awakening beginning with the French \"period of\r\nenlightenment,\" and crowned by the era of German classicism. Yet the\r\nFrench movement itself was based on English influence. Just as, at the\r\nRestoration, England had copied the France of Louis Quatorze, so France\r\nin return drew intellectual strength from the England of the second half\r\nof the eighteenth century--England was then vastly ahead of the\r\nContinent--and brought forth the \"_siecle de la philosophie_.\" Of the\r\ngreat Frenchmen who learned in the school of English thought,\r\nMontesquieu, Rousseau, and Voltaire stand foremost, and of these again\r\nVoltaire occupies indisputably the highest place. Voltaire was not only\r\nthe founder, but the very heart of the philosophic school which reared\r\nits front against the statutes and traditions and pretensions of the\r\nChurch. He had drunk deeply of the spirit of Newton and of Locke during\r\nhis exile in England, and spread abroad their views and discoveries,\r\nassisted by his genius, his sparkling wit, his lashing satire, and his\r\ngraceful style. None equally with him naturalized on the Continent\r\nEnglish free thought and English rationalism. Voltaire and Rousseau were\r\nas two great beacons planted in the century guiding as they would the\r\ncourse of philosophy. Both were champions of personal freedom and\r\nreligious tolerance in a benighted and down-trodden age. But the\r\ninfluence of the two men worked in very different ways, for in the one\r\nit was based on the head, in the other on the heart. Voltaire, the\r\nrealist, by his venomous and even reckless satires on the Church and on\r\nChristianity, dealt a severe blow to religion at large. Rousseau, the\r\nidealist, plunged into the mystery of good and evil, and was wrecked by\r\nthe very impracticability of his system.\r\n\r\nVoltaire, as is well known, spent the last twenty years of his life--his\r\n\"_verte vieillesse_\"--almost at the gates of Geneva, and Rousseau,\r\nactually one of its citizens, passed the greater part of his life\r\nwandering abroad, though he loved Geneva so dearly that he once fainted\r\nwith emotion on leaving it. Yet while both did battle so to speak from\r\nGeneva, neither of them was reckoned as a prophet in that city. After\r\nVoltaire had spent a couple of years at \"Les Delices\"--this was\r\nsubsequent to his break with the great Frederick--he bought Tournay and\r\nFerney, close to Geneva, to \"keep aloof from monarchs and bishops, of\r\nwhom he was afraid.\" Ferney, with its _parc a la Versailles_, and its\r\nfine castle, he made his residence; and there his niece did the honours\r\nof the house to the countless visitors who came from all parts to do\r\nhomage to the illustrious \"Aubergiste del' Europe,\" as he pleasantly\r\nstyled himself. It was not the salons of Ferney that induced him to\r\nreside there, but care for his health and a wish to be free from all\r\nfear of bastilles.\r\n\r\nGeneva was not inclined to bow in admiration before her famous\r\nneighbour, as has been already stated. She had by this time become a\r\ngreat intellectual centre. Men of science, naturalists, and philosophers\r\nthere congregated, and a reaction against the everlasting study of\r\ntheology, of which the fashion had been introduced by the Huguenot\r\nrefugees, having come about, the study of nature had taken its place.\r\nWhilst France was being governed by the Pompadours, Geneva was ruled by\r\na society of savants, inclined, it is true, to absolutism and narrow\r\nCalvinism, but still savants. It is a common error to suppose that\r\nVoltaire's influence took deep root in Geneva. Voltaire set the current\r\nrunning for the world at large indeed, but Geneva was not specially\r\naffected. In truth, most of her learned men were disinclined to do more\r\nthan follow Voltaire half way, as it were, into his philosophy, whilst\r\nsome of them, as, for instance, Charles Bonnet, were particularly narrow\r\nin their views, and were even heretic hunters.[79] Voltaire's contest\r\nwith the city authorities respecting the establishing of a theatre is a\r\ngood illustration of his want of real authority and influence there. It\r\ngreatly tickled his fancy to seduce the \"pedantic city still holding to\r\nher old reformers, and submitting to the tyrannical laws of Calvin\" from\r\nthe ancient path, and to make war on her orthodoxy. And as part of his\r\nplan he determined to introduce theatrical performances into the city.\r\nThe ball was set rolling by an article in the \"Encyclopedie\" by\r\nD'Alembert, but the arguments there adduced in favour of the theatre\r\nproved of no avail. Rousseau made a furious reply, and averred that a\r\ntheatre was injurious to the morals of a small town. In a large city,\r\nwhere the morals were already corrupt, it did not signify. The\r\nConsistoire was in a flutter, for it had pretended that the Genevans had\r\na prodigious love for light amusements. However, one day Voltaire\r\ninvited the city authorities to \"Les Delices,\" and there treated them to\r\na representation of his \"Zaire,\" and it was no little triumph to the\r\nwily old schemer that his audience were overcome with emotion. \"We have\r\nmoved to tears almost the whole council--Consistory and magistrates; I\r\nhave never seen more tears,\" he delightedly reports; \"never have the\r\nCalvinists been more tender! God be blessed! I have corrupted Geneva and\r\nthe Republic.\" Nevertheless he was not to triumph. The theatre at \"Les\r\nDelices\" had to be closed. He opened his theatre several times elsewhere\r\nin Genevan territory, and began to draw crowds, but in every instance\r\nwas compelled to close again. In truth, it was not till 1766 that Geneva\r\nhad a theatre of its own, and even then it lasted but two years. The\r\nbuilding was set on fire by some Puritans, and, being only of wood, was\r\nrapidly consumed. Crowds ran to the conflagration, but finding that it\r\nwas only the theatre that was on fire, they emptied their buckets,\r\nshouting, \"Let those who wanted a theatre put out the fire!\"\r\n\"_Perruques_ or _tignasses_,\" exclaimed Voltaire, with irritation, \"it\r\nis all the same with Geneva. If you think you have caught her, she\r\nescapes.\"\r\n\r\nRousseau (1712-1778) was the son of a Genevan watchmaker, and received\r\nbut a very desultory education in his early days. Whilst yet but a boy\r\nhe had drunk in the republican and Calvinistic spirit of his native\r\ntown, hence his democratic leanings. He was a lover of nature, and fond\r\nof solitude, and was possessed of a deep religious feeling, even though\r\nhis religion was based on sentiment. He witnessed the revolt of 1735-37,\r\nand, _enfant du peuple_ as he was, rebelled against the tyranny of the\r\npatricians, and gave vent to his indignation in his writings. He thus\r\nbecame the mouthpiece of a down-trodden people craving for liberty, of a\r\nsociety satiated with culture. His prize essay on \"Arts and Sciences\" is\r\nan answer in the negative to the question propounded by the Dijon\r\nAcademy, Whether the New Learning had resulted in an improvement to\r\nmorals. His next essay on \"L'origine et les fondements de l'inegalite\"\r\nis a sally against the state of society. In it he advocates a return to\r\nthe condition of nature, on which Voltaire sarcastically retorted, \"I\r\nfelt a great desire to go on all fours.\" \"Emile\" (1762), which Goethe\r\ncalls the \"gospel of education,\" declares against the hollowness of our\r\ndistorted and over-refined civilization, and advocates a more rational\r\ntraining based on nature. And Pestalozzi, pedagogue and philanthropist,\r\nthough he styled \"Emile\" a \"book of dreams,\" was yet nourished on\r\nRousseau's ideas. \"Emile\" is opposed to deism and materialism on the one\r\nhand, whilst on the other it objects to revelation and miracles, and\r\ndeclares that existing religion is one-sided and unable to save mankind\r\nfrom intellectual slavery. The excitement the book created was immense\r\non both sides, and it was publicly burnt both at Paris and Geneva. Its\r\nauthor was compelled to flee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROUSSEAU.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTRAIT OF PESTALOZZI.\r\n\r\n(_From a photograph of the statue, at Yverdon, by Lanz._)]\r\n\r\nA similar untoward fate befel the same author's famous \"Contrat Social,\"\r\nperhaps the most important political work of the eighteenth century. In\r\nthis Rousseau advances much further than Montesquieu. Indeed the former\r\nwas a strong Radical, whilst the latter might be more fittingly\r\ndescribed as a Whig. Rousseau advocates republicanism, or rather a\r\ndemocracy, as the best form of government; whilst Montesquieu points to\r\nthe constitutional government of England as his model, insisting on the\r\nright to equality of all before the law. The \"Contrat Social,\" as is\r\nwell known, did much to advance the revolutionary cause, and became\r\nindeed the textbook of the democracy, and formed the principal basis of\r\nthe Constitution of 1793. But Rousseau himself was no agitator. On the\r\ncontrary, when the burghers of Geneva rose on his behalf, to save\r\n\"Emile\" and the \"Contrat\" from the flames, he hesitated hardly a moment,\r\nbut begged them to submit to order, as he disliked disorder and\r\nbloodshed.\r\n\r\nHis novel, \"La Nouvelle Heloise\" (1761), introduced the romantic\r\nelement, and opened a new era in literature. It was, in fact, a\r\nmanifesto against a bewigged and bepowdered civilization. Poetry was\r\ninvited to withdraw from the salons and come once more to live with\r\nnature. But this sudden onslaught on the stiff conventionalism and\r\nnarrowness of the time was too much, and there ensued an outburst of\r\nexcitement and feeling such as we in our day can scarcely realize. A\r\ngreat stream of sentiment poured into literature, and gave rise to that\r\ntumultuous \"storm and stress\" (_Sturm und Drang_) period in Germany, out\r\nof which sprang Schiller's \"Raeuber\" (Robbers). Goethe caught up the\r\nprevailing tone of sentimentality and supersensitiveness in his\r\n\"Werther\" (1774). This tearful, boisterous period is but the outrush of\r\na nation's pent-up feelings on its sudden emancipation from the thraldom\r\nof conventionalism. And it led the way to the golden era in German\r\nliterature, the era of Schiller and Goethe.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant literary court of Madame de Stael at Coppet succeeded that\r\nof Voltaire at Ferney. Though born in Geneva she was in heart a\r\nFrenchwoman, and her native country but little affected her character.\r\n\"I would rather go miles to hear a clever man talk than open the windows\r\nof my rooms at Naples to see the beauties of the Gulf,\" is a\r\ncharacteristic speech of hers. Yet amongst women-writers Madame de Stael\r\nis perhaps the most generous, the most lofty, and the grandest figure.\r\nHer spirited opposition to Napoleon, her exile, her brilliant _coterie_\r\nat Coppet, and her famous literary productions, are topics of the\r\ngreatest interest, but as they do not specially concern Switzerland,\r\nthey cannot be more than hinted at here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HALLER.]\r\n\r\nFrom the very depression, political and social, prevailing in Swiss\r\nlands arose the yearning for and proficiency in letters and scientific\r\nculture which in the period now before us produced so prolific a\r\nliterature in the country. And it was not in West Switzerland alone\r\nthat this revival of letters showed itself. Basel prided herself on her\r\nnaturalists and mathematicians, Merian, Bernoulli, and Euler; while\r\nZurich could boast of her botanists, Scheuchzer and John Gessner. Bern\r\nproduced that most distinguished naturalist, Haller, who was also a\r\npoet; Schaffhausen claims Johannes von Mueller, the brilliant historian;\r\nand Brugg (Aargau) Zimmermann, philosopher and royal physician at\r\nHanover. Bodmer and Breitinger formed an aesthetic critical forum at\r\nZurich. And no country of similar area had so many of its sons occupying\r\npositions of honour in foreign universities. A whole colony of Swiss\r\nsavants had settled at Berlin, drawn thither by the great Frederick;\r\nothers were to be found at Halle. Haller, who had lived at Goettingen\r\never since 1736, likewise received an invitation from Frederick, but\r\nfound himself unable to accept it, being greatly averse to Voltaire and\r\nhis influence. A perfect stream of Swiss intellect poured into Germany,\r\nand by its southern originality, greater power of expression, and its\r\ntrue German instinct, quickened German nationality, and witnesses to the\r\nfact that there is ever passing between the two countries an\r\nintellectual current.[80] It is impossible within the limits of the\r\npresent volume to do more than touch upon the most characteristic\r\nliterary movements of the period.\r\n\r\nAmongst the upper classes in Switzerland, French culture reigned\r\nsupreme, just as did French fashions, French manners, and it may almost\r\nbe said, the French language. Nevertheless, the Swiss were the first to\r\nthrow off the French supremacy in literature, turning rather to England\r\nas a more congenial guide and pattern. Bodmer speaks of Shakespeare and\r\nMilton \"as the highest manifestations of Germanic genius.\" As for German\r\nliterature itself, it was still in a state of helplessness--what with\r\nthe Thirty Years' War, and the German nobility given over to French\r\ntastes and French influence--and fashioned itself in foreign modes till\r\nthe close of the Seven Years' War, in 1763, when it took the leading\r\nposition it has ever since maintained.\r\n\r\nBern and Zurich, which had both risen to wealth and independence, were\r\nstout opponents of the French policy. Both cities were homes of the\r\n_belles lettres_, and Zurich was a veritable \"poets' corner.\" The chief\r\nfigure there was Bodmer, who wielded the literary sceptre in Switzerland\r\nand Germany for well-nigh half a century. A fellow-worker with him, and\r\nhis well-nigh inseparable companion, was Breitinger, and these two more\r\nthan any others helped to break the French spell. Bodmer (1698-1783),\r\nwas the son of a pastor of Greifensee, and had himself been at first\r\ndestined for the church, though he was at length put to the silk trade.\r\nBut neither calling could keep him from his beloved letters, and in 1725\r\nhe became professor of history and political science at the Zurich\r\nCarolinum. His aim was to raise literature from its lifeless condition.\r\nAs far back as 1721, he had joined with Breitinger and others, in\r\nestablishing a weekly journal on the model of Addison's\r\n_Spectator_--\"Discurse der Maler.\" Breitinger was professor of Hebrew,\r\nand later on, canon of the minster of Zurich, and was a man of profound\r\nlearning and refined taste. The new paper treated not only of social\r\nmatters, but discussed poetry and _belles lettres_ generally. Gottsched\r\n(1700-1766), who occupied the chair of rhetoric at Leipzig, was supreme\r\nas a literary critic. His tastes were French, and he held up the French\r\nclassics as models. In his \"Critical Art of Poetry\" (1730), he tries to\r\nteach what may be called the _mechanics_ of poetry based on reason, and\r\npretends that it is in the power of any really clever man to produce\r\nmasterpieces in poetry. In 1732, appeared Bodmer's translation of\r\n\"Paradise Lost,\" to the chagrin of Gottsched, who, feeling that he was\r\nlosing ground, furiously attacked the Miltonian following. His mockery\r\nof the blind poet roused Bodmer's anger, and he replied with his work\r\nthe \"Wonderful in Poetry.\" A fierce controversy raged for ten years. In\r\nthe name of Milton the young men of talent took the side of Zurich, that\r\nis, of the German, as opposed to the French influence in literature. The\r\nresult was that by the efforts of such men as Haller, Klopstock,\r\nWieland, and Kleist, the French influence was ousted and the national\r\nGerman influence came to the front.\r\n\r\nAlbrecht von Haller (1708-1777), whom Goethe calls \"the father of\r\nnational poetry,\" was the first representative of the new school of\r\npoets which began to turn to nature for inspiration and illustration\r\nrather than to mere dead forms. His poems on the Alps (1732) paint the\r\nmajestic beauty of the Bernese highlands, and contrast the humble and\r\npeaceful but natural life of the shepherd with the luxurious and\r\nartificial life of the patrician, and the dweller in cities. Haller's\r\nwritings made a great impression on the polite world.[81] Klopstock it\r\nwas, however, whom Bodmer welcomed as the harbinger of a new era, as the\r\nGerman Milton. Klopstock had been trained in the Swiss school of\r\nthought, and regarded Breitinger's \"Critical Art\" as his aesthetic bible,\r\nwhilst Bodmer's translation of \"Paradise Lost\" inspired his epic,\r\n\"Messiah.\" The first three cantos appeared in the \"Bremer Beitraege\" in\r\n1748, and created such a _furore_ that he was declared to be an immortal\r\npoet. Wieland's first poems were, in 1751, published in the \"Swiss\r\nCritic,\" and met with a reception hardly less favourable if somewhat\r\nless enthusiastic. A strong friendship springing up between Bodmer and\r\nthe young Klopstock, the former offered the poet a temporary home at his\r\nTusculum (still standing) on the slopes of Zurichberg, that he might go\r\non with his great epic. The fine view of the lake and mountains, the\r\n\"highly cultivated city beneath,\" was greatly prized by Goethe who\r\nsounds its praises in \"Wahrheit und Dichtung.\" However, Bodmer was\r\ndisappointed with his young guest, for Klopstock loved the society of\r\nthe young men and young women of his own age, and the progress made with\r\nthe \"Messiah\" was well-nigh _nil_. However, it is to Klopstock's sojourn\r\nthere, that we owe some of his fine odes, especially that on Zurich\r\nlake. But meanwhile Bodmer's friendship had cooled, and Klopstock went\r\nto the house (in Zurich itself) of Hartmann Rahn, who later on married\r\nthe poet's sister. With this same Rahn was some years afterwards\r\nassociated the philosopher Fichte, when he lived at Zurich (1788).\r\nFichte in fact married Rahn's daughter, Johanna. In 1752, Wieland[82]\r\nrepaid Bodmer for his previous disappointments, by staying with him for\r\nsome two years.\r\n\r\nBodmer's zeal for the advance of literature was unremitting. Though he\r\ncould not himself boast of much poetic genius, he was a prolific writer\r\nin both prose and verse. His great merit is his bringing to light again\r\nthe fine old mediaeval poetry long since forgotten. The manuscript of the\r\n\"Minnesaenger\" and the famous \"Nibelungen\" he had dug up from the\r\nlumber-room of Hohenems Castle. He moved heaven and earth to obtain\r\nroyal protection and patronage for German literature. But little did he\r\ngain at the court of the great Frederick. To Mueller, who presented the\r\n\"Nibelungen,\" his majesty replied in characteristic fashion that the\r\npiece was not worth a single \"charge of powder.\" Not less characteristic\r\nwas Voltaire's reply when a request was made for the royal favour to\r\nKlopstock. \"A new 'Messiah' is too much of a good thing, the old one has\r\nnot been read yet.\"\r\n\r\nBodmer's influence on the young man of parts is noticeable. He gathered\r\nround him a large following of young Zuercher who had a taste for\r\nletters. Crowds of them would accompany him in his evening walks in the\r\navenue Platzspitz, drinking in his words of wit and wisdom. Of the\r\ndisciples thus gathered round \"Father\" Bodmer--for so he was\r\naffectionately styled--some attained no little eminence in later life.\r\nAmongst them we may mention Sulzer, who became art professor at Berlin,\r\nand stood in high favour with the king; and Solomon Gessner, the painter\r\npoet, whose word pictures are hardly less beautiful than the productions\r\nof his brush. His \"Idylls,\" published in 1756, gave him a European\r\nreputation. The work was translated into all the literary languages, and\r\nin France and Italy was read with great eagerness, a first edition in\r\nFrench being sold out within a fortnight. Another important work is\r\nHirzel's \"Kleinjogg,\" or the \"Socrates of the Fields.\" In this Hirzel,\r\nwho was a physician and a philanthropist, brings to the fore the\r\ndespised peasantry. \"Kleinjogg\" is not a work of fiction solely, but an\r\naccount of Jakob Gujer who lived in a small Zurich village. Jakob was a\r\nman of great intelligence, indomitable resolution, and practical wisdom,\r\nwho by his admirable management raised a wretched country home into a\r\nmodel farm. Goethe, who on a visit ate at his table, was delighted with\r\nthe philosophic peasant, and called him \"one of the most delicious\r\ncreatures earth ever produced.\"\r\n\r\nHeinrich Pestalozzi, the philanthropist, but better known for his\r\nefforts in the cause of education, was also a Zurich man. His principles\r\nof education are embodied in his novel of rural life, \"Lienhard and\r\nGertrude\" (1781). His ideas are partly borrowed from Rousseau, but he\r\nfailed to realize them in practice. The work at once won for Pestalozzi\r\nEuropean fame. Ludwig Meyer von Knonau, a country magnate, was a poet\r\nand a painter, and wrote \"Fables.\" Johannes Casper Lavater, Bodmer's\r\nfavourite pupil, stirred to their depth the patriotic feelings of his\r\ncountrymen by his famous \"Schweizerlieder,\" which he composed for the\r\nHelvetic Society, in 1767. Indeed literary tastes seem to have been very\r\nprevalent amongst the Swiss at that time. More of Winkelmann's great\r\nwork on AEsthetics were sold in Zurich and Basel then would in our own\r\nday probably be sold in such cities as Berlin and Vienna. And Solothurn,\r\nwe find, produced thrice as many subscribers to Goethe's works as the\r\ngreat cities just mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAVATER.]\r\n\r\nAfter Bodmer Lavater became the chief attraction at Zurich, and\r\nstrangers flocked thither in great numbers to see him. He was the\r\nfounder of the study of physiognomy, and his works on it were very\r\nlargely read at the time. Goethe himself joined with Lavater in his\r\n\"Essays on Physiognomy.\" The philosopher's personality being singularly\r\ncharming and fascinating, he was one of the most influential men of his\r\ntime. He was the pastor of St. Peter's church, and was full of high\r\nreligious enthusiasm. He desired to take Christianity from its lifeless\r\ncondition and make it a living thing, and was strongly opposed to\r\nrationalism--Anglo-French deism--then slowly creeping in,\r\nnotwithstanding severe repressive measures against it. Goethe was for\r\nmany years the close friend of Lavater, and carried on with him a\r\nbrilliant correspondence. The great poet, it may be stated, paid no\r\nfewer than three visits to Zurich, viz., in 1775, 1779, and 1797. He\r\nconsidered his intercourse with Lavater the \"seal and crown\" of the\r\nwhole trip to Switzerland in 1779, and calls the divine the \"crown of\r\nmankind,\" \"the best among the best,\" and compares his friendship with\r\n\"pastureland on heaven's border.\" Lavater's later years were marked by\r\nmany eccentricities, and he fell into religious mysticism. But his\r\nsterling merits will not readily be forgotten by the Swiss.\r\n\r\nA word respecting the Helvetic Society must close the present chapter.\r\nThis society was founded in 1762, with the view of gathering together\r\nthose who were stirred by political aspiration. It gradually united all\r\nthose who desired the political regeneration of their fatherland, and\r\nthe most prominent men of both East and West Switzerland, and of both\r\nconfessions, joined the new society. The young patriots regularly met to\r\ndiscuss methods of improving the country and its institutions, and this\r\nin spite of the prohibitions of a narrow-minded executive, and the close\r\ncontrol of the press. Stockar's scheme for amalgamating the free states\r\ninto one republic mightily swelled the hearts of both Catholic and\r\nProtestant, and their efforts gave rise to many practical reforms. The\r\nmost prominent result of these efforts was the rise of national\r\neducation. Zurich with its higher schools occupied a leading position in\r\nthe work of reform, and Pestalozzi established on his own estate a\r\nschool for the poor. Unfortunately this admirable institution failed for\r\nwant of a proper manager. Later on, after the Revolution, when the soil\r\nwas better prepared for it, Pestalozzi's system took vigorous root.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[79] Hettner's \"French Literature in the Eighteenth Century.\"\r\n\r\n[80] Switzerland was the cradle of the German drama in the sixteenth\r\ncentury; even the Oberammergau Passion play can be traced to a Swiss\r\norigin (Baechtold).\r\n\r\n[81] Haller, anxious to return to his native land, accepted an inferior\r\npost as director of salt-mines at Bex (Vaud), Bern, his native town,\r\ndisregarding his great merits, declining to offer him either a\r\nprofessorship or a seat on the governing board.\r\n\r\n[82] A daughter of Wieland was also married to the son of his great\r\nfriend Gessner, the poet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND SWITZERLAND.\r\n\r\n(1790-1798.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNone of our readers will need to be told the story of the French\r\nRevolution, nor shown that it was the natural outcome of previous\r\nmisgovernment and oppression. Every one has read of the miseries of the\r\nlower classes--intolerable beyond description; of the marvellous\r\ninability of the nobles and clergy to see that amidst all their\r\nselfishness and pleasures they were living on the very edge of a\r\nfrightful volcano; of the _tiers-etat_ and its emancipatory movement,\r\nwhich, outgrowing its primary intention, brought about a series of\r\nstupendous changes; of Napoleon, how he stopped this disorder and how he\r\nmade all Europe into one vast theatre of war. All this, in so far as it\r\nis the history of France, can only be alluded to here, but, inasmuch as\r\nSwitzerland was dragged into the whirlpool of changes, we must dwell\r\nupon some of the effects of the great Revolution. Not less clearly than\r\nin France itself did the cry of \"_Liberte, and egalite!_\" resound\r\nthrough the Swiss lands, filling the hearts of the unfree and the\r\noppressed with high hopes. Yet it was only after terrible sufferings and\r\nendless vicissitudes that the liberal principles of the Revolution came\r\nto the front, and admitted of that practical realization which was to\r\nlead up to a nobler and happier life for men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LION OF LUCERNE.\r\n\r\n(_From a photograph of the original._)]\r\n\r\nOf the many popular risings in Switzerland due to the influence of\r\nFrance, we may briefly touch on those which precede the Bern catastrophe\r\nin 1798. In September, 1791, Lower Valais rose against the _landvoegte_\r\nof Upper Valais, but the intervention of Bern checked the revolt. In the\r\nApril of the following year, Pruntrut (in the Bernese Jura) renounced\r\nits allegiance to the prince-bishops of Basel, and set up as an\r\nindependent territory, under the style of the \"Rauracian Republic,\" and\r\nthree months later the widely-extended bishopric itself was amalgamated\r\nwith France as the \"Department Mont Terrible.\" It was on August 10th of\r\nthis same year (1792) that the Swiss Guards defending the Tuileries\r\nagainst the Paris mob were massacred. Every one knows the story. \"We are\r\nSwiss, and the Swiss never surrender their arms but with their lives,\"\r\nwere the proud words of Sergeant Blaser to the crowds furious against\r\nthe protectors of royalty, and claiming that their arms should be put\r\ndown. When Louis was in safety, the Swiss Guards were withdrawn. But on\r\nleaving the palace they were suddenly attacked by thousands of the mob.\r\nResistance was plainly useless, yet the Swiss would not fly, and were\r\nruthlessly slaughtered. Of the 760 men and twenty-two officers, but few\r\nescaped that terrible onslaught. The beautiful and far-famed\r\nThorwaldsen monument--the \"Lion of Lucerne\"--with its inscription,\r\n\"Helvetiorum fidei ac virtuti,\" still keeps up the memory of the heroic\r\ncourage of the Swiss Guards.[83] The outrage aroused intense indignation\r\nat home, but could not be avenged. The subjects of the prince-abbot\r\nBeda, of St. Gall, secured under his mild rule the abolition of serfdom.\r\nHis successor, Forster, however, refusing the measure his sanction, was\r\ndriven from his see--till he returned under Austrian auspices--and a\r\nlarge rural district of St. Gall gained autonomy and freedom from the\r\nrule of the abbey in 1797. Geneva saw almost every possible change. At\r\none time she was rescued by Bern at Zurich, but was, in 1798, absorbed\r\nby France. The singularly harsh bearing of Zurich towards the country\r\ndistricts brought about the widespread insurrection of Staefa, in 1795;\r\nan insurrection vigorously suppressed however. The Italian lordships,\r\nseverely treated by Graubuenden, desired to be included in the Cis-alpine\r\nrepublic Bonaparte was forming, and the general advised that free state\r\nthat it should be admitted into their pale as a fourth member of equal\r\nrank. Finding that his advice was not taken, he suddenly proclaimed the\r\nmemorable maxim, \"that no people can be subject to another people\r\nwithout a violation of the laws of nature,\" and joined Valtellina,\r\nBormio, and Chiavenna to Lombardy. This arrangement he had ratified by\r\nthe treaty of Campo Formio, in 1797, which destroyed the Venetian\r\nrepublic, handing it over, indeed, to Austria, France taking the\r\nNetherlands and Milan as her share of the plunder.\r\n\r\nFew things served to draw the attention of France to Swiss lands more\r\nthan the Helvetic Club at Paris. This famous club was founded in 1790,\r\nby malcontents, chiefly from Vaud, Geneva, and Freiburg. They were bent\r\non the liberation of Switzerland from aristocratic domination, and\r\ndesirous of assimilating the form of government with that of France.\r\nThis suited the French Directory exactly, their aim being to girdle\r\nFrance with a strong belt of vassal states. Among these Switzerland was\r\nto serve as a bulwark, or at any rate as a battle-ground, against\r\nAustria; and France was not without hope of filling her _coffres-forts_\r\nwith Swiss treasure, now grown, after long years of peace, to great\r\ndimensions. Amongst the band of patriots two men stand out as leaders.\r\nOne was Cesar de La Harpe, a noble-minded and enthusiastic Vaudois, who,\r\nhowever, was more concerned for his own canton than for Switzerland at\r\nlarge. The other was Peter Ochs, of Basel, a shrewd and able man, but\r\nambitious, and a creature of France. La Harpe had once been taunted by a\r\nBernese noble, who reminded him that Vaud was subject to Bern, and this\r\nhe never forgot. Even at the Court of Catherine II. of Russia, to which\r\nhe had been called as tutor to the imperial grandchildren, he never\r\nforgot his republican principles. In 1797, returning from Russia, and\r\nbeing forbidden to enter Vaud, he joined the Helvetic Club at Paris, and\r\nthence launched forth his pamphlets against Bern. And in the Directory\r\nthings were making against that hapless canton, Reubel, a declared\r\nenemy, gaining a seat. Napoleon too was no lover of Bern. On his way to\r\nthe Congress of Rastatt, in 1797, he passed through Switzerland, and,\r\nwhile accepting the enthusiastic welcome offered by Basel and Vaud, he\r\ndeclined altogether to respond to that of Bern and Solothurn. Peter Ochs\r\nenjoyed Napoleon's full confidence, and was by him summoned to Paris,\r\nand charged with the drafting of a new constitution for Switzerland, on\r\nthe lines of the Directory. La Harpe and Ochs thus worked towards the\r\nsame end, though the motives of the two men differed greatly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LA HARPE.]\r\n\r\nVaud hailed with delight the French Revolution, and celebrated the fall\r\nof Bastille in the most ostentatious manner; Bern, on the other hand,\r\nlooked with dismay on the march of events, and, in Jan. 1798, sent\r\nColonel Weiss with troops into the province. France replied by\r\nimmediately sending men to occupy the southern shore of Lake Geneva.\r\nThis was done at the request of the Helvetic Club, which gave as a\r\npretext an old treaty of 1564, by which France guaranteed her support to\r\nVaud. In vain did Weiss issue manifestoes; Bern was irresolute, and\r\nVaud, feeling herself safe under the aegis of France, proclaimed the\r\nestablishment of the \"Lemanic Republic,\" with the seat of government at\r\nLausanne (Jan. 24, 1798). A simple accident which resulted in the death\r\nof a couple of French soldiers was by their general magnified into an\r\n_attentat_ of the \"Bernese tyrants\" against a \"great nation.\" The French\r\ntroops marched on Weiss, ousted him without the necessity of striking a\r\nblow, and then charged Vaud with a sum of L28,000 for services rendered.\r\nSuch proceedings struck terror into the hearts of the Swiss, and many of\r\nthe cantons--Basel, Schaffhausen, Lucerne, &c.--set about reforming\r\ntheir governments. With matters at this pass the Diet ordered that the\r\nnational federal oath should be sworn to, a proceeding which had been\r\nneglected for three hundred years. But this pretence of unity was a mere\r\nsham, as indeed were all these hasty attempts at reform. They failed to\r\navert the coming storm, as the rulers failed to read aright the signs of\r\nthe times. The Tagsatzung distracted and helpless dissolved on Feb. 1st.\r\n\r\nIn the operations which followed, the chief command of the French forces\r\nin Switzerland was transferred from Mengaud to Brune, a Jacobite of the\r\nschool of Danton. Brune directed his main attack on Bern, which, torn by\r\ndissensions, was wavering between peace and war. With Machiavellian\r\nastuteness Brune enticed the city into a truce. This truce, which was to\r\nlast till the 1st of March, was most injurious to the interests of Bern,\r\nas it allowed time both for Brune to increase his own forces, and for\r\nSchauenburg to join him with a body of troops from Alsace. The Bernese\r\nwere well-nigh paralyzed, and not unnaturally suspected treason amongst\r\ntheir own adherents. Unluckily, too, for her, Bern was far from popular\r\namongst her sister cantons, and was well-nigh left to her own resources.\r\nHer chief allies were Solothurn and Freiburg, but these surrendered to\r\nSchauenburg and Brune at the first shock, on March 2nd. The French\r\ntroops next marched to Bern, destroying on the way the national monument\r\nat Morat. But Von Grafenried secured a decided victory against Brune at\r\nNeueneck. On the other hand, Ludwig von Erlach, who attempted a stand\r\nagainst Schauenburg at Fraubrunnen, quite failed to hold his own, and\r\nwas driven back on Grauholz, a few miles from Bern. A life-and-death\r\nstruggle followed, even women and children seizing whatever weapons they\r\ncould and fighting desperately, many of them even unto death. For three\r\nhours the combat lasted, and the Bernese fighting with their old\r\nbravery, maintained their honour as soldiers. Old Schultheiss von\r\nSteiger, \"trembling in body, but stout in heart,\" cheered on his men\r\nregardless of the hail of bullets falling, but harmlessly, around him.\r\nFour times did the Swiss stand against the terrible onslaught of the\r\nFrench, but were at length compelled to yield to a force so superior in\r\nnumbers and tactics to their own. And even whilst the clash of arms was\r\nstill sounding the news came that Bern had surrendered. Erlach and\r\nSteiger fled to the Oberland, intending there to resume the combat; but\r\nthe troops, mad with suspicion that the capitulation was the result of\r\ntreason, murdered the former, Steiger narrowly escaping a similar fate.\r\nOn the 5th of March, 1798, the French entered Bern in triumph, Brune,\r\nhowever, cautiously keeping up strict discipline. On the 22nd of the\r\nprevious month at Lausaune, Brune had caused it to be proclaimed that\r\nthe French came as friends and bearers of freedom, and would respect the\r\nproperty of the Swiss citizens. Notwithstanding this he emptied the\r\ntreasuries and magazines of Bern, and on the 10th and 11th of March,\r\nsent off eleven four-horse waggons full of booty, nineteen banners, and\r\nthe three bears--which they nicknamed respectively Erlach, Steiger, and\r\nWeiss--the French carried off in triumph.\r\n\r\nThus fell Bern, the stronghold of the aristocracy, and with its fall the\r\ndoom of Switzerland was sealed, though more work remained to be done\r\nbefore it would be complete. The Directory now abolished the old\r\nConfederation, and proclaimed in its stead the \"one and undivided\r\nHelvetic Republic,\" forcing on it a new constitution elaborated from the\r\ndraft by Peter Ochs. Brune himself had had a scheme for a triple\r\ndivision of the territory, but a preference was given to a united\r\nrepublic, as more easily manageable from Paris. The thirteen old\r\ncantons, together with the various subject lands and connections were\r\nformed into twenty-two divisions. After the failure of the _laender_ the\r\nnumber was reduced to nineteen, the three Forest Cantons with Zug being\r\nthrown into one, as a punishment. Some of the rearrangements and\r\npartitions were very curious. A few may be cited. Oberland Canton was\r\nlopped off from Bern, and Baden from Aargau proper. Saentis included\r\nAppenzell and the northern portion of St. Gall, and Linth comprised the\r\nrest of St. Gall and Glarus; Tessin was split into Bellinzona and\r\nLugano; Vaud, Valais, and Buenden were added intact. Geneva and Neuchatel\r\nwere left outside. In this manner the united Helvetic commonwealth was\r\nformed, the central government being fixed at Aarau, Lucerne, and Bern\r\nin succession. The passing of laws was vested in a senate and great\r\ncouncil. There was a Directory of five members to whom were added four\r\nministers of state--for war, justice, finance, and art and science. A\r\nsupreme court of justice was made up of nineteen representatives, one\r\nfrom each canton. These were sweeping changes, and the unadvised manner\r\nin which they were forced on the people prevented their meeting with\r\ngeneral approval. And then France gained the hearty dislike of the Swiss\r\ngenerally by her treatment of the country. Switzerland was regarded as\r\na conquered and subject land, and was ruthlessly despoiled by the\r\nFrench. A contribution of sixteen million francs was imposed on the\r\nSwiss aristocracy--besides the eight million francs carried off from\r\nBern at her fall.[84]\r\n\r\nTen cantons, notably Bern, Zurich, Lucerne, and Vaud, _i.e._, the city\r\ncantons, feeling that resistance was impossible, and reform was\r\nnecessary, acquiesced in the new arrangement; but the _laender_, except\r\nObwalden, stirred up by the priests and local patriots, and fearing that\r\nreligion and liberty would die together, offered a most uncompromising\r\nresistance. They preferred, they said, \"to be burnt beneath their\r\nblazing roofs, rather than submit to the dictates of the foreigner.\"\r\nVery noble was the defence made by the Forest folk, but we can only\r\ntouch briefly upon it. After a brave resistance Glarus was defeated at\r\nRapperswyl, on the 30th of April, 1798, and then Schauenburg proceeded\r\nwith his whole strength against Schwyz. In its defence a band of some\r\nfour thousand stout-hearted men was collected under the command of\r\nReding, a young and handsome officer, who had just returned from Spanish\r\nservice. Reding was an enthusiastic patriot of the old stamp, deeply\r\nimbued with conservative principles. Men rallied to his standard\r\neagerly, and swore a solemn oath, \"not to flee, but conquer.\" Reding\r\nand his little army gained three brilliant victories, at Schindellegi,\r\nArth, and Morgarten, respectively, showing themselves worthy descendants\r\nof the old heroes of 1315. However, the French effected an entrance by\r\nway of Mount Etzel, through the failure of the priest Herzog to hold his\r\nown against them, and poured through the gap in overwhelming numbers.\r\nFor the moment they were thrust back at Rothenthurm, but Schwyz was too\r\nexhausted to continue the unequal struggle, and Reding was forced to\r\nenter into negotiations, though negotiations of an honourable character,\r\nwith Schauenburg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REDING.]\r\n\r\nThen followed the gloomy 9th of September, written down as \"doomsday\" in\r\nthe annals of Midwalden,[85] a day that well-nigh blotted that\r\nsemi-canton out of existence. Having set up a wild opposition to the\r\n\"Helvetic,\" this district drew down upon itself the wrath of France.\r\nAnimated by the spirit of Winkelried, one and all--its worthy sons, its\r\nwomen and children even--the little band--they were but two thousand as\r\nagainst sixteen thousand--for some days kept up the unequal struggle.\r\nThe little bay of Alpnach (Alpnacher See) and the Wood of Kerns\r\n(Kernserwald) were red with the blood of the enemy. But this state of\r\nthings could not last long. Suddenly the French broke through, and\r\npoured in from all sides. Terrible conflicts took place at Rotzloch and\r\nDrachenried, and a rush was made on Stanz, the chief place of the\r\ndistrict. By noon this town was really taken, but notwithstanding this\r\nthe combat continued in furious fashion till evening. This was the 9th\r\nof September, 1798, a day which Schauenburg called the hottest of his\r\nlife. \"Like furies,\" the report says, \"the black legion of the French\r\ngalley-slaves slew and raged the district through.\" When night set in\r\nStanz looked a devastated, smoking city of blood and death. Europe\r\nlooked with amazement, yet with admiration and sympathy, on this heroic\r\nspot of earth. Both England and Germany sent provisions and money, and\r\neven Schauenburg was moved with compassion towards the poor\r\nMidwaldeners, and had food distributed to them. It may perhaps here be\r\nnoted that Stanz shortly figures again in Swiss history, but this time\r\nin a far more peaceful and humane manner. It was here that Pestalozzi\r\nresumed his noble work of education. To heal the wounds of his noble\r\ncountry as far as was in his power the minister Stapfer founded an\r\neducational establishment for the orphan children of the district. And\r\nhere it was that Pestalozzi ruled, not so much as a mere pedagogue, but\r\nas a veritable father, the little unfortunates committed to his care.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[83] This grand work of art is carved out of and on the face of an\r\nimmense rock, after a model by Thorwaldsen--a wounded lion with a broken\r\nspear, representing hapless but noble courage. The work was executed in\r\n1821.\r\n\r\n[84] The exact sum paid by Bern is not known, but probably it reached\r\nseven or eight million francs. The Bernese losses, up to 1813, were\r\nestimated at seventeen million francs. One hundred and sixty cannon, and\r\nsixty thousand muskets were also captured. Bern had kept three bears (in\r\nthe Baerangraben of the town) ever since the battle of Novara, in 1513.\r\nStrangely enough the bears carried off in that battle were French\r\ntrophies.\r\n\r\n[85] The mountain range, running from Titlis north-west and then\r\nnorth-east to Stanzer Horn, with the Kernwald at its centre, separates\r\nUnterwalden into Obwalden (above the wood) and Midwalden (below the\r\nwood).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX.\r\n\r\nTHE \"ONE AND UNDIVIDED HELVETIC REPUBLIC.\"\r\n\r\n(1798-1803.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day of the \"one and undivided Helvetic Republic\" was a period of\r\n\"storm and stress,\" short-lived, full of creative ideas and vast\r\nschemes, with much struggling for what was most noble in the principles\r\nof the Revolution. Yet Helvetia was torn by inner dissensions, and its\r\nenergies paralysed by civil and foreign war, by its position of\r\ndependence, and by financial difficulties. The Helvetic scheme of\r\npounding the various members of the Confederation into one state wiping\r\nout the cantons--a scheme often planned since then, but to this day\r\nunrealized, and as yet unrealizable--by its inevitable levelling\r\ntendencies, roused intense disgust and hatred amongst the more\r\nconservative of the Swiss. In truth, it went too fast, and too far in\r\nthe direction of centralization. The _laender_ were robbed of their\r\n_landsgemeinde_, the city cantons of their councils, and the independent\r\nstates of their sovereignty. Everything seemed to be turned\r\ntopsy-turvy. Cantons became mere administrative districts.[86] The\r\nbarriers between them, and likewise between the various classes of\r\nsociety, were broken down. Subject lands were recognized as equal in\r\nstatus to the rest, and the inhabitants given full rights of\r\ncitizenship. Amongst the many beneficent measures brought forward the\r\nprincipal may be mentioned. All restrictions on trade and industry were\r\nremoved, tithes, bondservice, and land taxes could be redeemed at a\r\nsmall cost; freedom in religious matters, freedom of the press, and the\r\nright to petition were guaranteed, and torture was suppressed. That\r\nchild of the Revolution, \"the Helvetic,\" indeed, advocated many reforms\r\nand gave birth to many new ideas which required time and thought and\r\npeace to bring to maturity and usefulness. But the time was not yet\r\nripe, and peace was lacking, and many things were suggested rather than\r\nput into practice. Yet we look back with interest on many of the ideas\r\nof the time, for they paved the way for and led up to much of our modern\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nExcellent men, men of parts, wise and moderate, watched over the early\r\ndays of the young republic; amongst them Usteri, Escher (of Zurich),\r\nSecretan and Carrard (Vaud), and Mayer (Bern). But gradually French\r\npartisans, nominated from Paris, were returned to the Swiss Directory,\r\nand Ochs and La Harpe were promoted to the leadership of Helvetic\r\naffairs. Soon a \"reign of terror\"--of a milder form, perhaps, but none\r\nthe less a rule of terrorism--was set up, with the view of dragooning\r\nthe country into submission to the \"_grande nation_.\" A levy was\r\nenforced in order to make up a total of eighteen thousand men, a number\r\nthe Swiss were loth to produce for the foreigner. They objected to this\r\nforced service, and took up arms abroad, whilst men like Lavater and\r\nReding, who defied both French tyranny and \"Helvetic\" despotism, were\r\ntransported, or thrust into the filthy dungeons of the fortress of\r\nAarburg. On the 19th of August, 1798, was concluded the fatal\r\nFranco-Helvetic Alliance--offensive and defensive--despite the\r\nsupplications and warnings of the more far-seeing patriots, such as\r\nEscher (von der Linth) for instance. Swiss neutrality being thus\r\nabandoned, the door was opened to the Austro-Russian invasion, planned\r\nby the second European coalition with the view of ousting France from\r\nSwiss territory. Hating the new _regime_ exasperated at French supremacy\r\nand French extortion, and desirous that the _status quo ante_ of 1798\r\nshould be re-established, the reactionists hailed with delight the\r\ncoming of the Austrians, quite as much as the \"Patriots\" had before\r\nwelcomed the interference of France. A legion of Swiss _emigres_ abroad\r\ncollected by Roverea, at Vaudois, who had sided with Bern in the\r\nprevious struggle, joined the Austrian army. The foreign occupation\r\nwhich took place and turned Switzerland into one military camp cannot be\r\nfollowed in all its details here. Yet one or two points must be noted,\r\nabove all, those remarkable Alpine marches carried out, though against\r\nhis own will, by Suwarow. These marches are quite unique in military\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nAfter the defeat of the French in Southern Germany, the Tyrol, and\r\nItaly, by the Archduke Charles, Hotze, and Suwarow, they were to be\r\ndriven out of Switzerland. Marshal Massena, who had succeeded\r\nSchauenburg in the command of the French troops, had at the commencement\r\nof the war seized Graubuenden, and forced it, free state though it was,\r\nto join the Helvetic Republic to which it so strongly objected. But in\r\nMay, 1799, it was recaptured by Hotze, a gallant swordsman of Swiss\r\nbirth;[87] who had risen to the rank of field-marshal in the Austrian\r\narmy. Hotze drove the French from the central highlands, Roverea\r\nlikewise taking a prominent part in the expedition. About this time the\r\nArchduke Charles entered Switzerland at Schaffhausen, and, carrying all\r\nbefore him, advanced to Zurich. This city, after various skirmishes in\r\nits neighbourhood, he seized on the 4th of June, forcing Massena to\r\nretire to the heights beyond the Limmat river. But now a cessation of\r\nhostilities intervened for some months, owing to differences between\r\nAustria and Russia, and with this came a change of tactics. Archduke\r\nCharles withdrew, and his place was taken by Korsakow with a Russian\r\narmy forty thousand strong. A plan was now agreed upon under which\r\nSuwarow should join Korsakow from Italy, and they should then combine\r\ntheir forces in a grand attack on the French, on September 26th. This\r\nMassena was determined to prevent. By admirable manoeuvring he\r\ndisposed his eight divisions about Eastern and Central Switzerland, his\r\nforce amounting to no fewer than seventy-five thousand men. The\r\nhighlands of Schwyz, Uri, and Glarus, were held by Lecourbe, a skilled\r\nstrategist, thoroughly at home in the Alps, and the entrance to the St.\r\nGothard pass was blocked. Marshal Soult gave battle to Hotze in the\r\nmarshy district between Lake Zurich and Walensee, on the 25th of\r\nSeptember, with the result that Hotze was slain, and the Austrian force\r\nretired from Swiss soil. Wherever the Austrians had gained a footing,\r\nthe reactionists had taken advantage of it to re-establish the _status\r\nquo_. On the 25th and 26th of September, Massena attacked the Russian\r\nforces under Korsakow, at Zurich. This second battle of Zurich--the\r\nfighting was continued (from outside) into the very streets--resulted in\r\nthe complete defeat of Korsakow. Fortunately the city itself, having\r\nremained neutral, escaped violent treatment, but Lavater was unfortunate\r\nenough to be struck by a shot during the engagement, whilst carrying\r\nhelp to some wounded soldiers.[88]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DILIGENCE CROSSING THE SIMPLON PASS.]\r\n\r\nQuite unaware of what was being done in Switzerland, Suwarow reached the\r\nheights of St. Gothard on the 24th of September, and, finding the pass\r\noccupied by the enemy, cut his way through in brilliant style. Whilst\r\nsome of the Russians--at Teufelsbrueche, for instance--held in check the\r\nFrench, the larger portion of their army scrambled down the steep rocks\r\nlining the Reuss, amidst the French fire. Wading across the rapid\r\ntorrent they hurried down the valley to Flueelen, intending to push on to\r\nLucerne and Zurich. But to their great dismay they found no road\r\nskirting Uri lake, and all the boats removed. They were thus locked up\r\nin a labyrinth of mountain fastnesses, the outlets from which were\r\nblocked by their foes. In this desperate strait there was nothing for it\r\nbut to proceed over the mountains as best they might, by any rough path\r\nwhich might present itself. In reality, however, these passes were no\r\nhighroads for armies, but only narrow paths used by occasional shepherds\r\nor huntsmen. Devoted to their leader, the Russian troops toiled up from\r\nthe sombre Schaechenthal, and along the rugged Kinzig pass, pursued by\r\ntheir enemies. On reaching Muotta they learned the disheartening news\r\nthat Korsakow had been defeated. No wonder that down the weather-beaten\r\nface of the brave old general, the tears rolled as he gave the order to\r\nretreat. But Suwarow was not inclined to sit still and repine, and\r\nundaunted by his recent terrible struggle against nature, at once\r\nresumed his march across the toilsome Pragel pass into the canton of\r\nGlarus, where he had good hopes of finding Austrian friends. But on his\r\narrival he learnt that the Austrians had left the neighbourhood. Thus\r\nbaffled once more, and unable to get to the plains at Naefels on account\r\nof the enemy, he was compelled to retreat again, and again attempt the\r\nterrible passage across the mountains. Striking across the Panixer pass,\r\nwhich rises to the height of eight thousand feet, he found himself\r\nconfronted by greater difficulties than before. Snow had lately fallen,\r\nand all traces of the path had disappeared. For five terrible days the\r\nforce decimated, dying with cold, hunger, and fatigue, unshod--their\r\nboots were entirely worn out--struggled along those wintry regions,\r\ncreeping like caterpillars up walls of snow and over icy peaks. Hundreds\r\nof men and horses fell into the hidden crevices, down which also many a\r\npiece of artillery fell with sudden crash. Fully one-third of the\r\ngallant band perished during that fearful passage. The worn and famished\r\nsurvivors reached Graubuenden on the 10th of October, and thence made\r\ntheir way into Austrian territory. Suwarow had failed, but immortal\r\nglory attaches to the memory of the dauntless and resolute old general.\r\nThe non-success of the foreign invasions meant also the failure of the\r\nreactionists in their attempt to overthrow the \"Helvetic Republic.\"\r\n\r\nIndescribable misery was the consequence of the foreign wars, and it was\r\nintensified by the French occupation, and especially by the disgraceful\r\nsystem of spoliation practised by the French generals and agents,\r\nMengaud, Lecarlier, Rapinat, &c. A few examples of the treatment\r\nSwitzerland received at the hands of the French \"liberators\" may be\r\ngiven. Urserenthal, one of the Uri valleys, was called upon during the\r\nyear Oct. 1798 to Oct. 1799, to provide food for a total of 861,700 men,\r\nand a pretty hamlet in Freiburg for twenty-five thousand, within half a\r\nyear. During four months, Thurgau spent one and a half million francs,\r\nand the Baden district well-nigh five millions, in provisioning French\r\ntroops within a year. All protestations of inability on the part of the\r\ninhabitants were useless; Rapinat[89] and others, like vampires, sucked\r\nthe very life-blood out of the unfortunate Swiss. The \"Helvetic\r\nRepublic\" had its noble side, it is true, but the French occupation, by\r\nwhich it was maintained, and which indeed was the outcome of it, caused\r\nthe Helvetic scheme to be regarded by the people at large with disgust\r\nand hatred.\r\n\r\nThe brightest side of the \"Helvetic Republic\" was seen in the remarkable\r\nefforts of noble patriots--foremost amongst them Rengger and Stapfer--to\r\nmitigate the effects of all these calamities by promoting, in spite of\r\nall difficulties, or against all odds of the time, the material and\r\nideal interests of the people. Both Rengger and Stapfer were highly\r\ncultivated men, and both were ministers of state, the former holding the\r\nportfolio of finance, the latter that of arts and sciences. Rengger\r\ndirected his efforts to the improvement of trade and agriculture; one of\r\nhis practical efforts being the introduction of English cotton-spinning\r\nmachines. Stapfer, on the other hand, worked for the spread of popular\r\neducation. \"Spiritual and intellectual freedom alone makes free,\" he\r\nmaintained. He himself had been born in one of the new enfranchised\r\nsubject lands, it may be noted parenthetically. He drew up a remarkable\r\nscheme of national education, a scheme embracing the child in the\r\nprimary school, and the young man in the National University. This dream\r\nof a national university, by the way, is still unrealized,[90] but\r\nStapfer intended that it should crown his whole system of national\r\neducation, and should combine German depth with French versatility and\r\nItalian taste. Most of Stapfer's grand scheme remained untried through\r\nwant of means and time, but it was a very remarkable scheme for that\r\nday. Yet much was done. Numerous schools sprang up, and every canton had\r\nits educational council and its inspector of schools. Lucerne, which had\r\nhitherto been quite behindhand in these matters, now founded schools in\r\nall its communes (by 1801), and Aarau established a gymnasium. Some four\r\nthousand children from the wasted and ruined country districts were\r\nbrought into the towns and educated; whilst numerous journals were\r\nstarted, and many literary and art societies founded. Perhaps Stapfer's\r\nchief title to honourable remembrance is his appreciation of, and his\r\nassistance to, Pestalozzi. Leaving Stanz on account of confessional\r\ndifferences, the great philanthropist established his famous school at\r\nBurgdorf, winning for himself by it European renown.\r\n\r\nThese noble efforts towards national advancement intellectually are the\r\nmore admirable as the country was convulsed with constitutional\r\nstruggles. From the first days of the Revolution, there had sprung up\r\ntwo political schools, the Centralists, who[91] wished to see one single\r\nstate with one central government; and the Federalists, who clung to\r\nthe historical traditions of their fatherland, and to the _status quo\r\nante_ of 1798. These latter desired to see cantonal self-government\r\npreponderating over the central authority. It was a struggle to the\r\ndeath between advanced Liberals and stout Conservatives. Within the\r\nshort space of five years, the country saw no fewer than four _coups\r\nd'etat_, complete overthrowings of government and constitution. We can\r\nnotice only the chief points in the history of these changes. The first\r\nshock came with the change in France from the Directory to the\r\nConsulate, and the return of Napoleon from Egypt, on the 9th of\r\nNovember, 1798. Ochs, detested as the tool of France by nearly all the\r\nSwiss, was hurled from his eminence; and La Harpe following suit, the\r\nSwiss Directory was replaced by an executive committee. The Peace of\r\nLuneville, February, 1801, left the Swiss free to chose their own form\r\nof government, but Napoleon himself gradually went over to the\r\nFederalist view. Drafts of new constitutions followed each other in\r\nquick succession, each in its turn being upset by that which followed.\r\nThe sketch of La Malmaison, drawn up by the Federalists, restored the\r\nTagsatzung, and the independence of the cantons, May, 1801. Another\r\noverthrow, and then Alois Reding rose to the position of first\r\nLandammann, and head of the Conservative government (Oct. 28, 1801).\r\nChivalrous and of unflinching resolve, Reding lacked the pliancy\r\nnecessary for a statesman, and desired to see Vaud again placed under\r\nthe rule of Bern. \"Sooner shall the sun turn from west to east,\"\r\nfiercely exclaimed Napoleon, \"than Vaud shall go back to Bern.\" Reding\r\nwas deprived of his office, and shut up at Aarburg, a fate that befell\r\nhim on several other occasions under Bonaparte. In July, 1802, Napoleon\r\nwithdrew the French troops from Swiss territory, with the view\r\nostensibly of complying with the treaty of Amiens, but in reality to\r\nshow the Swiss how powerless they were without his help. This was the\r\nsignal for a general outbreak of civil war, humorously called\r\n_Stecklikrieg_, or _Guerre aux batons_, in allusion to the indifferent\r\nequipment of the soldiery. The Helvetic Government which was then in\r\npower fled from Bern, and took up its quarters at Lausanne. Its small\r\nforce was defeated at Avenches by the Federalists, who pushed on to the\r\nLeman city, when an order to lay down their arms reached them from\r\nParis. Through the medium of General Rapp, Napoleon offered his services\r\nas \"mediator\" in the civil troubles of Switzerland, and at his heels\r\nfollowed Marshal Ney, with an army of forty thousand men to enforce\r\norder.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[86] The utter failure clearly shows how little such a centralization of\r\ngovernment, leaving the cantons no scope for action, could suit the\r\nseparate states of the Confederation at any time. The name \"canton\" was\r\nfirst used in French treaties with Switzerland, and became thenceforward\r\nthe general term. It had not come into use even so late as the Helvetic.\r\n\r\n[87] He was a native of a large village in the Zurich district.\r\n\r\n[88] He lingered on suffering from his wound for a whole year, and then\r\ndied, distinguished to the very last by his love for all mankind, and\r\nfor his country especially.\r\n\r\n[89] The following lines, common in men's mouths afterwards, tell their\r\nown tale:--\r\n\r\n      \"La Suisse qu'on pille et qu'on ruine\r\n       Voudrait bien que l'on decidat\r\n       Si Rapinat vient de rapine,\r\n       Ou rapine de Rapinat.\"\r\n\r\n[90] And not very likely to be realized, as the respective cantons cling\r\nto their four universities and two academies, which are their pride.\r\n\r\n[91] In German, _Centralisten_ or _Unitarier_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE MEDIATION ACT AND NAPOLEON.\r\n\r\n(1803-15.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a constitutional point of view this period--the mediation period\r\n(1803-13)--is the most satisfactory portion of the epoch between the\r\nFrench revolutions of 1789 and 1830. It suited Napoleon's fancy to\r\nassume the position of a directing providence to the Alpine lands. And,\r\nfinding that the federalists and the centralists of Switzerland--the\r\n_laudatores temporis acti_ and the progressivists--were quite unable to\r\nagree upon a compromise, it pleased him to give the country a new\r\nconstitution. He stopped their squabbles by summoning the \"Helvetic\r\nConsulta\" to Paris. Sixty-three deputies, of whom but fifteen were\r\nfederalists, obeyed the call, many of the foremost statesmen among them.\r\nThose who disobeyed the summons, like Reding and his party, were\r\narrested (Nov., 1803). In the official gazette Napoleon was pleased to\r\nspeak of the Swiss nation as one that had \"always stood out in history\r\nas a model of strength, courage, and good manners,\" and he expressed a\r\nwish that the Swiss should \"aim at good government, and should sacrifice\r\ntheir party feelings to their real interests, to glory, and\r\nindependence.\" Thus complimentary was his language, and the painstaking\r\ncare and thoughtful consideration he brought to bear on the\r\nreorganization of Swiss affairs presents the great despot under a\r\nsingularly amiable aspect; and the Mediation Act which he drew up would,\r\nbut for the selfish _arriere pensee_ running through it, be one of his\r\nnoblest and most beneficent political acts.\r\n\r\nFrom the drafts and data presented by the Conference Napoleon, in two\r\nmonths (Nov. 25th-Jan. 24th), drew up his famous scheme. Laying it first\r\nbefore the whole assembly, he then had selected an inner committee of\r\nten for a further and final consultation. This took place on Jan. 29th\r\nat the Tuileries, the sitting lasting from one o'clock to eight in the\r\nevening. The French commissioners[92] afterwards stated that they had\r\nnever witnessed such a scene, and that \"never had the First Consul\r\ndevoted such close attention, even to the most important matters of\r\nEuropean politics.\" The Swiss party, representing both the political\r\nsections, and the four French Commissioners, sat round the table,\r\nNapoleon himself in the middle of them, beaming with graceful\r\namiability. The proposals respecting the three classes of cantons were\r\nread out, and two of the delegates, Stapfer of whom we have heard\r\nbefore, and Hans von Reinhard,[93] were called upon to express their\r\nrespective views. A general discussion followed, the Consul giving the\r\nclosest attention to every detail. His own speeches showed an intimate\r\nacquaintance with Swiss matters, and whilst full of practical wisdom,\r\nalso evidenced his real interest and sympathy with the little republic.\r\nHe pointed out that Switzerland was quite unlike any other country in\r\nits history, its geographical position, in its inclusion of three\r\nnationalities and three tongues. The characteristics and the advancement\r\nof three nations had, in fact, to be considered and maintained. Nature\r\nitself had clearly intended that it should be a federal state. To the\r\nForest Cantons, to which he avowed the whole republic owes its\r\ncharacteristic hue, he restored the time-honoured _landsgemeinde_, \"so\r\nrich in memories of the past\"; to the city cantons he gave back their\r\nancient councils, re-fashioned in accordance with modern ideas; and to\r\nthe subject lands he gave autonomy. The position of these last in the\r\npast was, he averred, incompatible with the modern character of a\r\nrepublic, and his elevation of them into new cantons is the special\r\nmerit of his scheme. Meeting the views of the federalists by giving\r\nindependence or home-rule to each canton, he also met those of the\r\ncentralists by planning a well-organized central government in the form\r\nof a _Tagsatzung_ with enlarged powers. At the head of this he placed a\r\nSwiss Landammann with almost _plein pouvoir_. Napoleon selected as\r\nfirst Landammann a man he highly esteemed--Louis d'Affry, of Freiburg,\r\nson of Count d'Affry. Both father and son had served in France as\r\nofficers and statesmen, and Louis was one of the few who had escaped the\r\nmassacre at Paris in 1792. He was a perfect courtier, mild and\r\nconservative in his views. It is worth mentioning that during the\r\n_intermezzo_, which occurred at five o'clock, when refreshments were\r\nhanded round, the Consul, standing by the mantelpiece, with a circle of\r\ndelegates round him, talked incessantly on Swiss politics and spared no\r\npains to impress on his hearers how much Swiss interests were bound up\r\nwith those of France. There was no mistaking his meaning, which, to do\r\nhim justice, he did not attempt to conceal. The members of the\r\nConference, whom Napoleon treated all through with marked distinction,\r\nwere quite alive to the danger threatening their country, but trusted\r\nthat some turn of the wheel might avert it. After this parley the Consul\r\nredrafted the Mediation Act, and presented it in person on the 19th of\r\nFebruary for signature, afterwards taking leave of the whole deputation.\r\n\r\nLa Harpe gained for the Swiss the countenance of the Emperor Alexander,\r\nand Prussia and Austria were engaged in a territorial squabble, and no\r\ninterference took place. An epoch of peace and prosperity followed the\r\ngeneral amnesty (April 15, 1803) granted by the Mediation Act. The\r\nperiod of quiet was broken only by the Bockenkrieg in 1804, a rising in\r\nwhich an attempt was made by the country folk of the Zurich Canton to\r\nstand against the unredeemed land rents and tithes still due to the\r\ncity.[94] The insurrection was put down by force.[95] Six new cantons\r\nwere formed by the new Act--Buenden, St. Gall, Thurgau, Aargau, Vaud, and\r\nTicino; and these were added as equals to the thirteen _Alte Orte_, the\r\nmanagement of its own affairs being granted to each. The liberal\r\nprinciples inaugurated by the \"Helvetic\" were to a great extent borne in\r\nmind, though the lower orders were still excluded from direct political\r\nrepresentation. Mercenary wars, military movements, and leagues between\r\nseparate cantons, were strictly forbidden; but so, also, was forbidden\r\nthe maintenance of a federal army, save a small force to maintain order,\r\nand thus the country was robbed of adequate means of defence. Freiburg,\r\nBern, Soleure, Basel, Zurich, and Lucerne, became in their turns\r\nmanaging or dictatorial cantons for one year at a time. That is, they\r\nwere the seats of the Diet, and their chief magistrate--schultheiss or\r\nburgomaster, as the case might be--became Landammann. To the larger\r\ncantons, _i.e._, those having not less than one hundred thousand\r\ninhabitants, two votes at the Diet were assigned, to the smaller, one\r\nvote. It is not necessary to go into more minute details here, as there\r\nare numerous constitutional changes to be noted between that period and\r\nthe year 1874.\r\n\r\nThus, whatever may be thought of Napoleon's ultimate aims, it was owing\r\nto him that Switzerland enjoyed quiet, prosperity, and perfect\r\nself-government at a time when Europe generally was torn by quarrels and\r\nsteeped in war. The Swiss people gave their whole attention to home\r\naffairs, and to the striving after intellectual and material progress,\r\nas they had done in the Helvetic days, but now with more success.\r\nBenevolent societies were founded, high schools established, and\r\ninstitutions for the advancement of letters, science, and art, sprang\r\nup. Many men of note mightily stirred the ideal side of life; amongst\r\nthem we may mention the novelist, Zschokke,[96] of Aargau; Martin\r\nUsteri, the poet-artist; and George Naegeli, the Saengervater, or \"Father\r\nof Song.\" Both these latter were of Zurich, and Naegeli gave a great\r\nimpulse to the founding of musical societies, and did much to spread the\r\nart of singing so common in the German districts, and especially\r\ncultivated at Basel and Zurich. Pestalozzi established a new school at\r\nYverdon in Vaud; and his friend and former pupil, Von Fellenberg, of\r\nBern, the superior of his master in practical management, founded his\r\nfamous institution at Hofwil. This comprised a whole series of schools,\r\nhigh schools, schools for the middle class, agricultural schools, and\r\nelementary schools for the poor. Pater Girard, a friend of Pestalozzi,\r\nat Freiburg, did for the Catholics much what these men did for the\r\nProtestants. Another noble and devoted man was Escher, who, though of\r\naristocratic birth himself, was yet an ardent worker for the benefit of\r\nthe poorer classes. His chief work was the canalization of the Linth\r\nbetween Walensee and the Lake of Zurich, by means of which some\r\ntwenty-eight thousand acres of unhealthy swamp became valuable\r\nagricultural land. For this labour of love, to which he sacrificed his\r\nhealth, the Diet decreed to him and his family the honourable addition\r\nof \"Von der Linth.\"[97] The introduction of machinery gave a great\r\nimpetus to trade and industry. In 1800 the cloisters of St. Gall were\r\nturned into the first Swiss spinning mill, and during the following\r\ndecade four more mills were started in the canton. In 1808 Heinrich\r\nKunz, the \"King of spinners on the Continent,\" laid the foundations\r\n(Zurich) of the first of his numerous mills. In 1812 the great firm of\r\nRieter and Co., whose machines soon gained a world-wide reputation,\r\nstarted business at Winterthur.\r\n\r\nYet all was not smooth in the little Swiss state. Switzerland was\r\ncompelled not only to enter into a close defensive alliance with France,\r\nbut to keep the French army constantly supplied with sixteen thousand\r\nSwiss soldiers. So great was the drain of this \"blood-tax,\" that in\r\nsome cantons even the prisons had to be opened to enable the levy to be\r\nmade up. Switzerland was made an _entrepot_ for English contraband\r\ngoods; and the decree of Trianon, in 1810, ordered the confiscation of\r\nthese, and placed a tax on English goods of half their value. All this\r\nweighed heavily on Switzerland, and the Landammann's touching\r\nrepresentation to Napoleon, that twenty thousand families were rapidly\r\nbecoming breadless, passed unheeded. In 1806 the despot gave Neuchatel\r\nto his favourite general, Berthier, and in 1810 he handed over Ticino to\r\nItaly, on the pretext that that district was harbouring English\r\ncontraband goods. The same year he joined to France the Valais district,\r\nwhere he had a few years earlier (1802) constructed the famous Simplon\r\nroad into Italy. The Swiss naturally protested against these\r\nmutilations, but he threatened to annex the whole country, and D'Affry\r\nand Reinhard, who stood in favour with him, had much ado to calm his\r\ntemper. When, however, the impetuous Sidler, of Zug, and the heroic\r\nReding, defied him, and advised an armed resistance at the Diet,\r\nNapoleon sent word to Reinhard that he would march fifty thousand men\r\ninto the country, and compel the Swiss to unite with France.\r\n\r\nBut the tide was beginning to turn; Napoleon had passed his zenith. The\r\nfatal Russian expedition, into which his pride and reckless ambition\r\ntempted him in 1812, was followed by the terrible disaster of Leipsic,\r\n\"the battle of the nations.\" The allied armies marched to Paris, and\r\ncompelled the abdication of the emperor. This turn of events naturally\r\naffected the position of the Swiss very greatly, but, quite content with\r\ntheir new constitution, they declined to join the allied states. At the\r\ncommand of the Landammann, Von Reinhard, General von Wattenwil placed\r\nhis scanty forces, numbering some fifteen thousand men, along the\r\nfrontier to enforce neutrality if possible. But on the approach of the\r\nallied forces Wattenwil saw that resistance would be madness, and gave\r\norders to his men to withdraw, and be careful not to provoke\r\nhostilities. About Christmas time in 1813, the combined Austrian and\r\nGerman troops--Alexander was for sparing the Swiss--to the number of one\r\nhundred and seventy thousand, marched right across the country on their\r\nway to the French capital. On the whole little material injury was done\r\nto the country, but the Mediation Act, by the very reason of its origin,\r\nwas bound to fall. On the 29th of December the Diet was compelled to\r\ndecree its own extinction. The Peace of Paris, on the 31st of May in the\r\nfollowing year, guaranteed Switzerland its independence. A new\r\nconstitution was to come later on.\r\n\r\nThe overthrow of the Mediation Act plunged Switzerland into fresh\r\ntroubles. All the reactionary elements came to the surface. Bern revived\r\nher old pretensions to the overlordship of Vaud and Aargau; and\r\nFreiburg, Solothurn, Lucerne, and the Forest Cantons, acting on the same\r\nlines, supported Bern in her claims. Zurich, on the other hand, stood\r\nout for the nineteen cantons, and headed the opposition to Bern. Again\r\nthere was seen the deplorable spectacle of a divided state, with two\r\nconfederations and two diets. One of these, with its headquarters at\r\nLucerne, was, however, forced to dissolve, by foreign pressure, chiefly\r\nthrough to the influence of D'Istria, the Russian ambassador at Zurich.\r\nAll the cantons now sent representatives to the Diet held in this\r\nlast-named city, with the view of drawing up a new federal pact. But\r\nparty strife was very bitter, and the session lasted from April 6, 1814,\r\nto the the 31st of August, 1815, an extraordinary length of time hence\r\nit was called the \"Long Diet.\" The protracted proceedings were caused\r\nchiefly by Bern, which obstinately refused to abate her pretensions to\r\nthe two districts (Vaud and Aargau). There were, however, many minor\r\npoints of difference, all tending to embitter and prolong the session.\r\nIt was clear that a settlement could only be brought about by a\r\ncompromise, and great concessions on the part of some of the members. As\r\na matter of fact several things were left unsettled. This Zurich\r\nconstitution was to be laid before the Vienna Congress, which opened on\r\nthe 3rd of November, 1814, and which was to disentangle many knots in\r\nEuropean politics.\r\n\r\nMonarchs, princes, ambassadors, ministers, and generals, from all the\r\nstates, met at the gay city on the Danube, to rearrange the map of\r\nEurope. The story of this strange international gathering is well known,\r\nwith its Vanity Fair of fine ladies and gentlemen, its magnificent\r\nfetes, balls, masquerades, steeplechases, and gaities innumerable. It is\r\nsaid that Francis I. spent no less than thirty millions of florins on\r\nentertaining his guests, and the gay scene and high spirits formed a\r\nstrange contrast with the previous despondency prevailing on the\r\nContinent generally. The \"_Congres danse, mais ne marche pas_,\" was the\r\nsaying that went abroad. Yet it was not strange that men felt glad. The\r\nweight of Napoleon's hand was now removed, and the world breathed more\r\nfreely. All the sufferings of the last quarter of a century were\r\nforgotten, and, it is to be feared, the lesson to be learnt from them\r\nwas not learnt. The changes were too many, too sudden, and too sweeping\r\nto permit anything to take root. But the seeds left behind by the\r\nrevolutions and wars will blossom and bear fruit later on. Every sound\r\nmovement must develop gradually. In this way only can we account for the\r\nreactions, the return to the old lines of constitution and social life,\r\nafter the fall of Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland had many points to settle at the Congress, and, indeed, to\r\nthe despair of the members, seemed inclined to bring forward all her\r\ndomestic squabbles. On the whole, the commissioners showed much goodwill\r\ntowards Switzerland, and took great pains to make that country a strong\r\noutpost against French extensions. Von Reinhard, the first Swiss\r\nrepresentative at the Congress, gained much praise by his dignity and\r\nastuteness, and the Emperor Alexander entered fully into his liberal\r\nviews and aspirations, coinciding with those of La Harpe. Bern and her\r\npretensions, which were as strong as ever, gave most trouble, Vaud and\r\nAargau naturally insisting on retaining their independence. At length a\r\ncompromise was arranged, and the larger portion of the see of Basel\r\n(Bernese Jura, &c.), and Bienne being given to Bern. The bailiwicks of\r\nthe _laender_ redeemed their freedom by purchase; the rest of the\r\ncantons, more generous, required no compensation. Subject lands were set\r\nfree for good, and the country received its present boundaries. Ticino\r\nhad been restored by Napoleon, and Valais, Geneva, and Neuchatel, were\r\nadmitted as cantons on an equality with the rest, and thus we get the\r\nnow familiar number of twenty-two cantons. The list was closed, though\r\nby a strange anomaly Neuchatel still continued to be not only a Swiss\r\ncanton, but a Prussian duchy. Geneva was, as it were, rounded off by the\r\naddition of Versoix (Gex), and some Savoy communes.[98] Geneva had long\r\nwished to be received into the Federation, and great was her rejoicing\r\nnow that her dream was realized. Thus Switzerland received the great\r\nboon of independence, and was placed under the protection of the Great\r\nPowers. Buenden lost her appendages, Valtellina, Chiavenna, and Bormio,\r\nwhich went to Austria, but gained in return the district of Raezuns. The\r\nnew constitution assigned to Switzerland is decidedly inferior to the\r\n\"Mediation Act.\" There was a revival of the old system of narrow\r\nprerogatives; the several cantons gaining _plein pouvoir_ as against the\r\nfederal authorities; the cities retaining their preponderance over the\r\nrural districts, and the wealthy and the aristocracy their power over\r\ntheir poorer brethren. Military matters alone were better provided for.\r\nThus we shall presently find that Revolution had to begin her work over\r\nagain. Bern, Zurich, and Lucerne became in turn the seat of the Diet,\r\nand one vote only was allotted to each canton. Midwalden offered a\r\nfanatical opposition to the new constitution, but was compelled to give\r\nway, and had to forfeit Engelberg, with its famous cloister and the\r\nwhole valley, which was given to Obwalden.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[92] Barthelemy, Roederer, Fouche, and Desmeunier.\r\n\r\n[93] This Hans von Reinhard was burgomaster of Zurich and Landammann; he\r\nbelonged to one of the old aristocratic families of his native city.\r\n\r\n[94] The liquidation of this territorial debt was a most complicated\r\nmatter, and plays an important part in the risings of the rural\r\ndistricts, yet the rightly cautious city had to consider various other\r\ninterests besides those of the country folks. Many benevolent city\r\ninstitutions for the sick and poor were maintained by the income drawn\r\nfrom country dues.\r\n\r\n[95] \"It is meet that the country districts should cease their antipathy\r\nto the city, or they deserve to fall again under its authority,\"\r\nNapoleon had remarked, during the Paris Conference, to the Zurich\r\nrepresentatives, Reinhard and Paul Usteri. He added that the personal\r\ncharacter of the representatives was a guarantee that they would\r\nreconcile the two parties they represented.\r\n\r\n[96] A German by birth.\r\n\r\n[97] Escher died soon after the completion of the Linth Canal (1822),\r\nand the Diet erected to his memory a monument in Glarus Canton. A\r\ncharacteristic story respecting him is worth repeating. Some poor man\r\nseeing him standing hard at work up to his waist in water exclaimed,\r\n\"Why, sir, if I were as rich as you, I shouldn't work at all.\" \"That's\r\njust why God has given you no wealth,\" was Escher's quiet reply.\r\n\r\n[98] She objected to receiving the larger strip of Savoy and French land\r\n(on the lake and the Rhone), which the Congress wished to assign her,\r\nfor fear of being absorbed by Catholicism, and, moreover, she was\r\nanxious not to alarm her old friends. The facts were and are often\r\nmisrepresented. Chablais and Faucigny, once temporarily held by Bern,\r\nwere declared neutral, and placed under the guarantee of the Powers.\r\nThat is, in case of war, Swiss troops quarter the district, as in\r\n1870-71.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII.\r\n\r\nSWITZERLAND UNDER THE CONSTITUTION OF 1815-48.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the thirty-three years following 1815 may, so far as\r\nSwitzerland is concerned, be summed up in this description--it was a\r\nprotest, latent at first and afterwards open and declared, of the Swiss\r\npeople against the decrees of the Vienna Congress, which tended to stop\r\nthe wheel of progress. The Swiss struggled onwards through the conflicts\r\nof political development, and battled against all that was a hindrance\r\nto them in the constitution of 1815, the Powers looking on with\r\nmisgiving if not with dismay the while not understanding the signs of\r\nthe times. Yet, by 1848, when the thrones of Europe were again shaken by\r\nrevolutions, Switzerland had gained that for which it had been\r\nstruggling, and had settled down into a peaceful and regenerated\r\n_Bundestaat_. We have shown how the settlement of 1815 was in many ways\r\na return to old lines in both Church and State. Speaking generally, the\r\nChurch gained greatly by the new constitution, the return of the\r\nJesuits was favoured, the religious establishments were still maintained\r\nat a rate which really exceeded the financial possibilities of the\r\nstate, and the clergy were given a free hand. Then the old power of the\r\naristocracy was largely re-established, and the cities were given their\r\nformer great preponderance over the country districts. Bern, for\r\ninstance, receiving two hundred seats in the Council, as against\r\nninety-nine. The reactionary _regime_ from 1815 to 1830, was, in fact,\r\npolitically a blank, though towards its close some of the cantons began\r\nto carry measures of reform. Amongst these was Ticino, into which some\r\nfatal abuses had crept. To make up for their political deficiencies, and\r\nto rekindle their smouldering patriotism, the Swiss, as they had done\r\nbefore, turned to the past history of their country. They founded\r\npatriotic and literary clubs, and established liberal and benevolent\r\ninstitutions. Monuments were erected at classical spots--Morat, St.\r\nJacques, the lion monument, and so forth. Eminent painters like Vogel\r\nand Didary chose national historical events for their canvas; and Rudolf\r\nWyp composed the fine national anthem, \"_Rufst Du mein Vaterland_.\"[99]\r\nA naturalists' club at Geneva, a students' association at Zofingen, and\r\na society of marksmen--still in existence--were started, whilst the old\r\nHelvetic Society of the eighteenth century left behind its mere\r\ntheorizings and discussions, and became an active political club. All\r\nthese things tended greatly to spread and promote Swiss liberalism, of\r\nwhich many noble champions had sprung up, now and in the previous\r\nperiod, like the veteran trio--Victor von Bonstetten, the friend of\r\nMadame de Stael, La Harpe, and Usteri; like Troxler, Zschokke, Monnard,\r\nVon Orelli and others, far too numerous even to name here. Under such\r\nmen Switzerland moved on. \"No human efforts can succeed in permanently\r\nleading back mankind to the old lines of a past and less enlightened\r\nage. To struggle onwards, and to reach the end aimed at is the\r\nquickening stimulus in every thinking being.\" Such were the encouraging\r\nwords of Usteri, a champion whom the party of progress regarded as an\r\noracle. Military matters received a great impetus by the formation of a\r\ncentral school for officers at Thun, and the increase of the army from\r\nfifteen thousand to thirty thousand men. It hardly needs to be said that\r\nwhen the struggle of the Greeks for independence began they had the\r\nhearty sympathy and support of the Swiss.[100]\r\n\r\nIn 1830 the revolution of July hurled from his throne Charles X., and\r\nraised to his place Louis Philippe. Strangely enough the effects of this\r\nmovement were felt almost more abroad than in France itself. Certainly\r\nits influence on Switzerland was very considerable, and it hurried on\r\nvarious changes of a sweeping character in that country, changes,\r\nhowever, which had been long preparing. Constitutional struggles, both\r\nfederal and cantonal, crowded the next few years, and confessional\r\ndifficulties tended not a little to quicken them. With nearly all the\r\nstates, excepting some of the _laender_, the chief object now became the\r\nrevision of their charters, so as to make them more consistent with the\r\nprinciples of popular rights and equality. Glarus, Uri, and Unterwalden\r\nwere as yet averse to making changes, however justifiable and desirable\r\nthey might seem to the rest of the country. The reforms were for the\r\nmost part quietly carried out, but there were popular oppositions and\r\nstormy disputes in places. Bern was at first inclined to be\r\nconservative, but once embarked on the sea of reformation, sided\r\nstrongly with the more progressive Zurich. Freiburg returned a crowd of\r\nfifty-seven priests and seventeen professors, all of the Jesuit order,\r\nand these ousted Girard, the Catholic Pestalozzi, from his noble work at\r\nSt. Michael's College. Zurich proceeded in a peaceful and interesting\r\nfashion. Here as in other cases the city had a great preponderance of\r\npolitical power over the country districts of the canton. The fourteen\r\nthousand citizens elected one hundred and thirty representatives, as\r\nagainst the eighty-six assigned to the two hundred thousand rural\r\ninhabitants. The cause of the country folk was ably and without\r\nbitterness championed by two eloquent speakers, Guyer and\r\nHegetschweiler; and a motion was carried which allotted to the rural\r\ndistricts two-thirds of the seats on the council board. This \"day of\r\nUster,\" as it was called, proved a great landmark in political\r\ndevelopment. The sovereignty of the people was now the basis on which\r\nreforms were made. The foundation was laid for better administration,\r\nand social improvement and provision was made for necessary revisions of\r\nthe constitution. To safeguard their constitutions against the\r\n influence of reactionists, seven cantons entered into a\r\nleague--_Siebner-Concordat_--March, 1832. They were Bern, Zurich,\r\nLucerne, Solothurn, St. Gall, Aargau, and Thurgau.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERLAKEN, FROM THE FELSENEGG.]\r\n\r\nLess satisfactory was the course of events in Schwyz, Basel, and\r\nNeuchatel. In Schwyz a temporary separation into the two semi-cantons of\r\nInner and Outer Schwyz was caused by the refusal of the former to grant\r\nequal rights to the latter, which had been formerly subject or purchased\r\nland mainly. Basel, the city of millionaires and manufactures, was able\r\nby her overwhelming importance to hold her supremacy over the rural\r\ndistricts, and thus arose the division into Baselstadt, and Baselland,\r\nwhich latter had Liestal as its _chef lieu_. But all this after a civil\r\nstrife of three years. Basel city joined the Catholic League formed at\r\nSarnen, in November, 1832, as a counterblast to the _Siebner-Concordat_.\r\nUri, Inner-Schwyz, Unterwalden, Valais, and Freiburg also joined this\r\nleague. The inhabitants of Neuchatel had a double object, the\r\nreformation of their constitution, and their separation, if possible,\r\nfrom Prussia, the double _regime_ being greatly disliked. An attempt was\r\nmade on the castle, but it failed, and the Federation re-established\r\norder, and the old _status quo_. The royalist party in Neuchatel now\r\naimed at a severance from Switzerland.\r\n\r\nBut the natural consequence of constitutional revision in the separate\r\ncantons was the revision of the federal pact, with the view of\r\nstrengthening the bonds which joined the states. The draft of a new\r\nconstitution for Switzerland was presented at Lucerne in July, 1832, by\r\nthe moderate party, but it failed, as so many other attempts have done\r\nwhich clashed with the selfishness of those cantons, that thought more\r\nof the question of cantonal home-rule than of the weal of the country as\r\na whole. A far-seeing policy required that the central government should\r\nbe strengthened, that the Diet should be made thoroughly capable of\r\nprotecting Swiss interests, both in the country itself and abroad. That\r\nthe Diet was quite incapable of enforcing its decrees for the general\r\ngood was plainly shown by the condition of things in Basel, alluded to\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nWith all these drawbacks, however, the period from 1830-1848 witnessed a\r\ntrue regeneration--social, political, intellectual. Never had education\r\nmade such marvellous progress. It is to this period that the country\r\nowes that revival of educational zeal and that improvement in schools\r\nand methods of teaching, which are the great glory of modern\r\nSwitzerland. Canton vied with canton, and authority with authority, in\r\ntheir noble enthusiasm for education. Zurich, Bern, Thurgau, Solothurn,\r\nVaud--all these founded excellent teachers' seminaries. Primary schools\r\nwere improved, and secondary schools established in every canton, and in\r\nall the more important cities gymnasiums were founded. At Zurich these\r\ntime-honoured institutions, the Chorherrenstift and the Carolinum, were\r\nin 1832 converted into the present gymnasium and university, and Bern\r\nmade similar establishments in the following year. Thus were being\r\ngradually realized the noble aspirations of the \"Helvetic\" period, those\r\nof Stapfer particularly.\r\n\r\nUnfortunate conflicts with foreign powers, however, not seldom arose.\r\nFugitives from other countries then as now made Switzerland their abode,\r\nand many of them abused her hospitality, and entangled her in\r\ndissensions with foreign governments, exactly as we find happening at\r\nthe present moment. Many of the political _emigres_ were men of great\r\nnote, but space will permit of our noticing only two, Louis Philippe,\r\nand Louis Napoleon, afterwards Napoleon III. The Prince de Chartres\r\nlived for some years in Graubuenden, occupying under the name of Chabaud,\r\nthe position of mathematical master in an educational establishment of\r\nrepute at Reichenau. Singularly enough he afterwards refused to the man\r\nwho was to succeed him on the throne of France, the privilege of shelter\r\nin Swiss lands, that is to say, he objected very strongly. For in 1838\r\nhe suddenly requested that the Swiss Diet should give up Louis Napoleon,\r\non the plea that he was an intriguer. This request was in reality a\r\ndemand, and was more than the Swiss could stand. Napoleon was in fact a\r\nSwiss burgess, having become naturalized, and having passed through the\r\nmilitary school at Thun, and become a captain in the Swiss army. His\r\nmother had for some time lived with her son in the castle of Arenenberg\r\n(in the Canton of Thurgau), which she had purchased soon after 1814.\r\nThanks to the efforts of Dr. Kern, representative of that state in the\r\nDiet, the Swiss Government were able to disprove the charge made against\r\nLouis Napoleon, and the Diet firmly refused to expel the prince. France\r\nenraged threatened war to her \"turbulent neighbour,\" and actually set on\r\nfoot an army of twenty-five thousand men. Thoroughly roused, the Diet\r\nsent troops to the frontier, amidst general acclamations, Geneva and\r\nVaud being conspicuous in their endeavours to protect their boundaries.\r\nThese two cantons were specially thanked by the central government. The\r\nprince, however, cleared away difficulties by quitting the Swiss\r\nsoil.[101]\r\n\r\nThe Zurich conflicts of 1839, called \"Zurichputsch,\" from a local word\r\nmeaning push or scramble, claim a moment's attention. That canton had\r\nperhaps more thoroughly than any other carried through a reorganization\r\nof its legislature and administration. It had establishment a most\r\ncomplete system of schools, graded from the primary school up to the\r\nUniversity, whose chairs were occupied by men who made the city a real\r\nintellectual centre--by Oken, Hitzig, Schweizer, Von Orelli, Bluntschli,\r\nand others. Things marched too rapidly however. Dr. Scherr, a\r\nrationalist German _emigre_, was at the head of an excellent\r\ntraining-college for teachers, but refused to allow biblical teaching to\r\nbe given. Then the Government, anxious to make the city of Zwingli a\r\ncentre of freethought, appointed the famous Strauss, author of the\r\n\"Leben Jesu,\" to a vacancy on the university staff, despite the warnings\r\nof the native professors. The country people rose in wild frenzy, being\r\nurged on by the reactionary party, which desired to regain the reins of\r\ngovernment. So great was the feeling against the appointment, that\r\nStrauss was pensioned off even before he saw the city. Even yet the\r\nexcitement was very great, and, led by Pastor Hirzel, the rural\r\ninhabitants flocked into Zurich in great numbers. The Council was\r\nobliged to resign, and for a considerable period the reactionists had\r\nthe power in their own hands. A few persons, but not many, were killed\r\nduring the disturbances. The effects of this _contre-coup_ in the most\r\nadvanced city of the republic were soon felt in other places, in Ticino,\r\nLucerne, and Freiburg, where conservative governments were returned,\r\nand codes altered accordingly. Zurich and Lucerne left the\r\n_Siebner-Concordat_.\r\n\r\nBut the event which stands out more prominently than any other during\r\nthis period is the Sonderbund war of 1847. This conflict, which\r\nthreatened the very existence of the state, forms the prelude to the\r\nEuropean disturbances of the following year. This dispute of 1847 is the\r\nold struggle between the centralists and the federalists, or rather the\r\nprogressivists and the reactionists, the dispute being intensified by\r\nreligious differences. The chief points in the conflict must be briefly\r\nnoted. In some of the cantons the Catholics, though in a minority, had\r\nadvantages over the Protestant population, and when, in 1841, Aargau was\r\nrevising its constitution, the latter demanded to be put on an equal\r\nfooting with their Catholic brethren. This was flatly refused, and an\r\nembroilment took place in the canton, some of the monasteries taking a\r\nleading part in fomenting the quarrel. The rising, however, came to\r\nnought, and the Diet, on the motion of Keller, suspended the monastic\r\nhouses, on the plea that they were hotbeds of intrigue. This step was\r\nclearly in opposition to the principles of the Constitution of 1815, and\r\nfor years caused great trouble. It is impossible to give here minutely\r\nthe story of the disputes: suffice it to say, the Diet compromised\r\nmatters by extending forgiveness to four of the cloisters that had kept\r\naloof from the rising (1843). But in 1844 Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Zug,\r\nFreiburg, and Valais, formed a secret league--that of Sarnen had long\r\nsince fallen through--to protect Catholic interests, and appointed\r\nJesuits to the highest offices in the state. The entrance of the order\r\nat the Vorort created great excitement, but the Diet abstained from\r\nintervening, fearing to make matters worse. Two hapless expeditions of\r\n\"Free Lances\" now took place, the liberals from Lucerne and other\r\ncantons attempting to carry that city. The attempts utterly failed, and\r\nnaturally so, seeing in how disorganized a condition the partizans were.\r\nBut in January, 1847, the Protestants managed to get a majority at the\r\nDiet, and demanded the dissolution of the Sonderbund, as it had got to\r\nbe called by that time. The foreign courts--Paris, Vienna, Berlin, and\r\nothers--sided with the Swiss Sonderbund, being anxious to retain the\r\n_status quo_ of 1815; France and Austria particularly sending money and\r\npromises of further support. England alone favoured the Protestants of\r\nSwitzerland, and rendered them a great service. Palmerston was all\r\nagainst foreign intervention, and when the Powers issued a manifesto\r\nagainst the Swiss, he kept it back till Nov. 30th, when all was quietly\r\nsettled. Meanwhile the Sonderbund organized a Council of War, and\r\nprepared for action. The Diet did all in its power to reconcile the\r\ncontending religionists, and the English ambassador at Bern strongly\r\nrecommended moderation and mutual concessions.[102]\r\n\r\nSeeing that in spite of all their efforts war was inevitable, the Diet\r\nlevied an army of ninety-eight thousand men, at the head of which was\r\nplaced General Dufour of Geneva. The Sonderbund raised seventy-five\r\nthousand men, under General Salis-Soglio, a Protestant from Buenden.\r\nDufour was a soldier of the old Napoleonic school, and a consummate\r\ntactician, and was revered by his fellow countrymen for his patriotism,\r\nlofty character, and high culture. It was under his management that the\r\nSwiss topographical maps bearing his name--the first of their kind--were\r\nexecuted. His selection as general gave great satisfaction. Thanks to\r\nDufour's ability the campaign was short, lasting only from the 4th to\r\nthe 29th of November, 1847, and the losses were comparatively small.\r\nHonours were lavished on Dufour on all sides, even they of the\r\nSonderbund heartily acknowledging his great services.\r\n\r\nHeartburning and jealousy enough and to spare there had been between the\r\nopposing religious parties. On the 29th of October, 1847, the last\r\noccasion on which the Diet had attempted to reconcile Catholic and\r\nProtestant, there had been the utmost dissension and rancour. But such\r\nis the nature of Swiss patriotism that when, three short months after,\r\nthe countries around Switzerland were convulsed with revolutions, and\r\nthe Swiss lands were threatened with invasion, the contending\r\nreligionists forgot their domestic quarrels entirely. And the glorious\r\nsight was seen of Catholic and Protestant standing shoulder to shoulder,\r\nready to vie with each other in meeting danger and death in defence of\r\ntheir common and beloved fatherland. Not a vestige of hostile party\r\nfeeling was left. It has ever been thus in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[99] Wyp had studied at Goettingen, which was still under English rule,\r\nand had there been impressed by the English national anthem, of which\r\nhis own is an imitation, the air being borrowed from \"God save the\r\nQueen.\"\r\n\r\n[100] One of the leading collectors of subscriptions in aid of the\r\nGreeks was Eynard, a wealthy Genevese, whose own contributions were most\r\nmunificent.\r\n\r\n[101] \"La Suisse a montre qu'elle etait prete a faire les plus grands\r\nsacrifices pour maintenir sa dignite et son honneur.

Providence had dealt graciously with the little republic.\r\nFrance, Prussia, and Austria were battling with the \"February\r\nRevolution,\" and were thus prevented from dealing out to her the fate of\r\nunhappy Poland. Meanwhile eminent Swiss statesmen were drafting the new\r\nFederal Constitution which was to bind the various nationalities into\r\none people, and the twenty-two cantons into a well-riveted Bundestaat, a\r\nstate which, thanks to its policy, its prosperity, and its independent\r\nspirit, was soon to command the esteem of even the most antagonistic\r\nPowers.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of September, 1848, the new pact was proclaimed, amidst\r\ncannonading, illumination, and general rejoicing. The old and crippled\r\nTagsatzung was abolished. The new constitution borrowed some features\r\nfrom that of the United States, and, though greatly on the lines of the\r\nMediation Act, blended far more happily the central and federal\r\nsystems. Only the essential points can here be noted.\r\n\r\nThe Central Government, whose _raison d'etre_ is the maintenance of\r\npeace and order at home, and the upholding of the national honour\r\nabroad, divides itself into three authorities or divisions, the Federal\r\nAssembly, the Legislative body; the Federal Council, which is the\r\nexecutive body; and the Federal Tribunal. The Federal Assembly consists\r\nof two chambers, the National Council, and the Council of the States;\r\nthe former elected by the Swiss people at large, the latter representing\r\nthe different cantons. The Nationalrath is elected by ballot for three\r\nyears, one member to every twenty thousand souls. At present (1889)\r\nthere are 145 members. The cantonal governments elect the members of the\r\nother chamber, two to each canton, one to a semi-canton. The Federal\r\nCouncil (Bundesrath) is the Executive, and consists of seven members.\r\nIts chairman or president holds the highest dignity in the country,\r\nthough his powers do not exceed those of his fellow-ministers. The whole\r\nCabinet is _collectively_ responsible for the conduct of all public\r\nbusiness, and holds the _summum imperium_. Thus the _whole Federal\r\nCouncil, and not its president only_, occupies the position similar to\r\nthat of the President of the United States.[103] There are various\r\ndepartments of the Executive--Foreign Affairs, Interior and Education,\r\nJustice and Police, Military, Finance and Customs, Industry and\r\nAgriculture, Post and Railway. The Federal Assembly sits twice a year,\r\nand elects both the Bundesrath, and Bundesgericht (Tribunal). The\r\nCabinet is subject to re-election every three years, but the same\r\nministers are commonly chosen again and again. The Tribunal, or\r\njudiciary body, consists of nine members, who are elected every six\r\nyears, with headquarters at Lausanne (since 1884).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POLYTECHNIKUM AT ZURICH.]\r\n\r\nBern, on account of its position between the German and French-speaking\r\ndistricts, was chosen as the seat of the central government. Zurich was\r\nto have been the home of the National University, but the plan failed,\r\nand it is now the seat of the National Polytechnikum, or technical\r\nuniversity. Thus the two leading cities of the Confederation keep up\r\ntheir old characteristics, as governmental and intellectual\r\nrespectively. Zurich's claims to intellectual distinction are\r\nunquestionable. Its magnificent system of schools, &c., is probably one\r\nof the most complete in Europe, if not in the world.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious as it is unnecessary to enter in detail into the\r\npowers of the central government as compared with those of the separate\r\ncantons. Suffice it to say, that the Bund reigns supreme in all\r\nrelations with foreign states--it is only through the medium of the\r\ncentral government that any canton can treat with a foreign Power--that\r\nit controls all military matters, regulates coinage (Mints), weights and\r\nmeasures, posts and telegraphs, and fixes customs duties. It also partly\r\ncontrols the national education--the Polytechnikum at Zurich is wholly a\r\nfederal affair, for instance--but in general each canton is left to its\r\nown devices in the matter. Thus, though every Swiss takes a pride in his\r\nschools, there is not one uniform standard throughout the state.\r\n\r\nEvery burgess is bound to perform military service, and at any time a\r\nforce of 200,000 men of the _elite_, and first reserve, can be placed in\r\nthe field, not including the Landsturm. Since the Franco-German war\r\nmilitary matters are engaging the serious attention of the country,\r\nseeing the central position of Switzerland, and the unsettled state of\r\nEurope.[104] It remains to be said that the new Constitution secured\r\nfreedom in religious matters, though the Jesuits were denied free\r\nsettlement, and the Jews were not recognized till 1866. The _Octroi_, or\r\nduties between the cantons, was not removed till 1887, and then only\r\nafter a hard fight on the part of some of the cantons, notably Bern, to\r\nwhom these dues were a great source of profit.\r\n\r\nIt is a problem requiring all the powers of the skilled statesmen to\r\nmake the two Swiss sovereignties--the federal and cantonal--run side by\r\nside without allowing either to trench on the other's ground. And it is\r\na much disputed point how far it is to the national benefit to increase\r\nthe powers of the Federal Government. The centralization of the\r\nGovernment undoubtedly secures a better administration in most points,\r\nbut the cantons jealously guard against any infringement of their rights\r\nby the Federation. They believe that a healthy rivalry and emulation\r\nbetween the states is a good thing, and one not lightly to be given up.\r\n\r\nThe new Bundesrath was soon called upon to prove the quality of its\r\nmettle, for troubles arose in Neuchatel. This canton was, up to 1848, a\r\nveritable mediaeval relic in its form of government--a mixture of\r\nmonarchy and free state. Few spots in Europe have had a more typical and\r\ncharacteristic history than Neuchatel, and did space permit it would be\r\nmost interesting to trace that history downwards, from its junction with\r\nthe empire in 1033; through its rule by native lords, the counts of\r\nNeuchatel, till their extinction in 1395; its vassalage to the house of\r\nChalons; the suzerainty of the Orleans-Longueville family; the regency\r\nof Marie de Nemours (1679-1707). But here suffice it to say, that\r\nthrough fear of the designs of Louis Quatorze, Neuchatel gladly\r\naccepted the ducal supremacy of the kings of Prussia. In 1815 it was\r\nincorporated with the Confederation, as a canton with equal rights and\r\nstanding to the rest. Notwithstanding this, Prussia still claimed to be\r\nits overlord, and thus arose a double _regime_, a condition of things\r\nplainly untenable. In 1848 the Confederation endeavoured to obtain the\r\nrelease of the canton from Prussian rule, and this by the peaceful\r\nmethods of diplomacy, but in vain. In 1856 a conspiracy was set on foot\r\nto undo the work of 1848--the granting of a more democratic constitution\r\nto Neuchatel. At the head of these royalist plotters were Count\r\nPoustates and De Meuron. However, their plans failed, and five hundred\r\nprisoners were taken. Out of these, twenty-five were by order of the\r\nFederal Government kept back to be tried as insurgents. Frederick\r\nWilliam IV., of Prussia, demanded their unconditional pardon and\r\nsurrender, an order obedience to which would have been a renunciation of\r\nthe canton, and a defiance of the Federal rule. The demand was refused,\r\nand the question of the release became the centre about which all the\r\nnegotiation now turned. In this emergency Napoleon III., of France,\r\noffered his services as mediator, mindful of the hospitality shown to\r\nhim of old by Switzerland. He further promised to espouse the Swiss\r\ncause if the prisoners were released, and to Switzerland his offer\r\ncarried greater weight than all the promises of Prussia. \"I shall act in\r\nthe matter as if I were the Swiss Government,\" he assured Dr. Kern, who\r\nhad been sent as special envoy to the French Court, and in a further\r\nconversation tried in every possible way to prove his sympathy with the\r\nlittle republic.[105] England made similar promises. However the\r\nPrussian king made no overtures, and neither France nor England gave\r\nsufficient guarantee that Neuchatel should be ceded to Switzerland, and\r\nthe Swiss Government therefore declined to proceed further on these\r\nvague terms. Frederick William threatened war, and began to mobilize his\r\ntroops. The Federal Council likewise began its preparation, and without\r\noutward sign of fear or hesitation, but with a unanimous feeling of\r\nheroic enthusiasm though the length and breadth of the country, the\r\nSwiss went on with their military organization. Most touching instances\r\nof devoted patriotism were witnessed--from the greyhaired old man to the\r\nmere boy the people offered their services; fellow-countrymen abroad\r\nsent large sums of money; even school children offered their savings.\r\nCatholic and Protestant, French and German, Italian and Romansch, all\r\nwere animated by one spirit, all were equally ready to defend the honour\r\nand independence of their beloved country. Dufour was again elected\r\nCommander-in-chief of the Federal forces. To the crowds who gave him a\r\nsplendid ovation he replied in these memorable words: \"I rejoice to end\r\nmy life in the service of my country. I am old\"--he was seventy--\"and my\r\ntask is heavy, for the enemy is powerful, but I trust I shall carry on\r\nmy mission in the name of the God of our Ruetli, who has never ceased to\r\nprotect our Fatherland.\" Such has ever been and ever will be the love of\r\nthe Swiss for their native soil, a love not based merely on the beauty\r\nof their land, nor on the perfection of its institutions, but on the\r\nknowledge that it is a stronghold of noble freedom, and one of their own\r\nrearing. The proud bearing of the Swiss made a great impression on the\r\nPowers, and particularly excited the admiration of Napoleon, who,\r\nforgetting the former distrust shown towards him, again offered his\r\nservices as mediator. By his advice the prisoners were conducted to\r\nFrance, and there set free, on January 16, 1857, and they remained in\r\nbanishment till the settlement of the dispute. This was finally\r\naccomplished on May 26th, at the conference of Paris, when the Prussian\r\nking formally renounced for ever all claims on Neuchatel, whether duchy\r\nor canton, retaining, however, the title of Fuerst von Neuenburg. Thus\r\nthe district was entirely ceded to Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe cession of Nice and Savoy to Napoleon III. by Victor Emmanuel in\r\n1859-60, led to dissensions with the emperor, which might have turned\r\nout serious, the Swiss having some claims on Chablais and Faucigny. The\r\npoint is not settled even yet. There have also been disputes with the\r\nPapal See, consequent on the development of the Old Catholic movement,\r\nand the Pope's encroachments. Though the old diocese of Geneva had been\r\nlong abolished, Pius IX. appointed Mermillod as bishop. Lachat, Bishop\r\nof Solothurn, turned out of their cures several priests for declining to\r\naccept the dogma of infallibility. The exasperation in the country was\r\ngreat, the two bishops were banished from Switzerland, and the Papal\r\nNuncio was discharged. It was not till 1883 that Mermillod was allowed\r\nto return.\r\n\r\nIt remains to speak briefly of some of the constitutional revisions\r\nwhich have taken place, up to 1883, or even to the present moment. In\r\n1874 the Federal Pact was amended. Briefly the improvement on the pact\r\nof 1848 consisted mainly in arranging a better and more effective\r\ncentralization in financial, military, and judicial matters. Experience\r\nhad brought to light many defects in the representative system.\r\nPersonal, local, or class interests often weighed more with delegates\r\nthan national interests; or occasionally a minister would assume too\r\ngreat powers to himself. To give the people a more direct share in the\r\nlegislation, two institutions were set on foot which are peculiar to\r\nSwitzerland. These are the \"Initiative\" and the \"Referendum.\" They are\r\nperhaps the furthest developments of democracy yet reached, and are\r\nexciting considerable interest in English-speaking countries at the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nThe Initiative is a development of the right of petitioning. By it any\r\nvoter or voters may propose new legislation, and if the requisite number\r\nof voters can be got to support the proposal by signing the formal\r\npetition in its favour, the matter must be put to the popular vote. The\r\nnumber of signatures necessary is five thousand in the case of cantonal\r\nlegislation, and fifty thousand in Federal matters. The people have thus\r\nalways the power to bring on the discussion of any matter, however much\r\nthe Council, or the legislators may object.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF SION. (_From a Photograph_.)]\r\n\r\nThe Referendum, which by the way is far more frequently applied,\r\nsecures that any law passed by the cantonal assemblies, or by the\r\nFederal Assembly, shall be put before the forum of the whole\r\npeople[106]--_referred_ to the whole body of voters--if again the\r\nrequired number of supporters can be got together. In cantonal matters\r\nthis number is the same as in the case of the Initiative; in matters\r\nrelating to the Confederation, thirty thousand votes, or eight cantons\r\nare necessary. There are two kinds of Referendum, adopted by different\r\nparts of the country, the \"facultative,\" or optional Referendum, by St.\r\nGall, Zug, Lucerne, Baselstadt, Schaffhausen, Vaud, Neuchatel (1882),\r\nGeneva, Ticino (1883); and the \"obligatory\" or compulsory Referendum,\r\nwhich obtains in Zurich (1869), Bern (1869), Thurgau, Aargau, Solothurn,\r\nSchwyz, Graubuenden, and Baselland. Uri, Glarus, the two Unterwalden, and\r\nthe two Appenzell cantons, still cling to their old _landsgemeinde_,\r\nwhilst Valais has a _financial_ Referendum, and Freiburg is content with\r\nits older representative form of government. Opinion is much divided in\r\nSwitzerland as to the value of the Referendum. In this, probably, most\r\nSwiss agree, that an arrangement which places the sovereign will of the\r\npeople above that of the authorities and legislative bodies is a good\r\narrangement, providing the people at large are intelligent and educated.\r\nAnd here Switzerland shows to great advantage. Probably no people in the\r\nworld have so fully and so clearly recognized that \"education alone\r\nmakes free.\" The Swiss educational system is such, that it reaches down\r\nto the poorest child and penetrates into the remotest valley. All\r\nprimary education is gratuitous and compulsory. If any people deserve by\r\neducation and intelligence to be entrusted with powers like that\r\nconferred by the Referendum, it is the Swiss. Yet men of every political\r\nshade admit that the Referendum is a two-edged weapon which may cut both\r\nways. It is at any rate no new thing in Switzerland. It may be styled a\r\n_landsgemeinde by ballot_. And, as far back as the sixteenth century,\r\nthe question of the Reformation was put to the Referendum--in a somewhat\r\ndifferent way, it is true--both in Zurich and Bern. In its present form,\r\nof course, the Referendum is modern. It is curious to find that though\r\nintroduced by the advanced democratic party it turns out in actual\r\nworking to be a decidedly conservative measure. It may stop a sound and\r\nbeneficial measure occasionally, but it is more likely to check rash and\r\ninsufficiently considered legislation, as the Swiss are naturally averse\r\nto needless changes. An example or two may serve to illustrate this.\r\nBaselland thrice brought forward a Bill for the revision of its cantonal\r\ncode; thrice the Bill was rejected, under the compulsory Referendum. At\r\nZurich quite recently (spring of 1889), the Grand Council wished to\r\nbring in a new law for bettering the education of the masses by\r\nimproving the supplementary schools. The country labourers had a\r\nmajority, and rejected the measure, objecting, it is said, to the\r\nadditional expenditure. It is to be hoped, however, that this measure\r\nwill be carried eventually. On the whole, perhaps, the \"facultative\"\r\nReferendum is to be preferred to the obligatory. We may mention, in\r\nconclusion, that out of 107 Bills passed by the Federal Council, between\r\n1874 and 1886, nineteen were submitted to the Referendum, and of these\r\nnineteen, but six were ultimately adopted by the whole body of voters\r\nthus appealed to.[107]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAW COURTS AT LAUSANNE.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[103] There is, in fact, no office in Switzerland similar to that of the\r\nUnited States President, though foreigners nearly always speak of the\r\n_President of the Swiss Republic_, when they mean simply the _Chairman\r\nof the Cabinet_.\r\n\r\n[104] The reader is referred for fuller information to the most\r\ninteresting account by Sir F. O. Adams and Mr. Cunningham in \"The Swiss\r\nConfederation\" (Longmans).\r\n\r\n[105] Kern, \"Souvenirs Suisses,\" pp. 124-129, where other instances of\r\nNapoleon's goodwill in 1848-9 are mentioned.\r\n\r\n[106] Legislative Acts are, in fact, referred _to the whole people_ for\r\napproval or disapproval, as in limited monarchies they are referred to\r\nthe _sovereign_. But in Switzerland the veto possessed by the people is\r\na _real_ thing, and not a virtual impossibility, as in England for\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\n[107] For further notes on the Referendum, see Adams and Cunningham's\r\n\"Swiss Confederation,\" alluded to above. The Referendum seems likely to\r\nattract increasing attention, in England and America especially.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV.\r\n\r\nINDUSTRY, COMMERCE, RAILWAYS, EDUCATION THE \"RIGHT OF ASYLUM.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOur story must be brought to a close with a short account of several\r\nimportant matters on which nothing has as yet been said, viz., the\r\nindustrial condition of the country, and its material progress. Hardly\r\nany other country has had to contend with so many natural disadvantages\r\nas Switzerland, in prosecuting her industries and establishing her\r\ntrade. The difficulty of the country, the absence of coal and iron, the\r\nwant of navigable rivers, the scanty produce of the soil in the more\r\nelevated districts, the want of seaboard--all these and other things\r\nincreased the severity of the struggle in the race for wealth. Then she\r\nis fenced in as it were by protection. As a set-off against these\r\ndrawbacks, there is an abundance of water-power. But it is evident that\r\nagriculture alone could not suffice to provide for all the inhabitants,\r\nand thus it comes to pass that the Swiss have turned their energies in a\r\nremarkable manner to the establishment and development of manufactures.\r\nIt may here be pointed out parenthetically that the poverty of the\r\ncountry in the pre-manufacturing days accounts for, and to some extent\r\nexcuses, the old and reprehensible practice amongst the Swiss of hiring\r\nthemselves out as soldiers to the highest bidder. Raw material in vast\r\nquantities is imported, and finished goods sent out. Switzerland\r\ncompetes successfully with some of the greatest manufacturing\r\ncountries--England, Belgium, France--nay, considering her population,\r\nshe almost surpasses them. Putting imports and exports together,\r\nSwitzerland does a trade of L60,000,000 annually, the imports consisting\r\nmainly of coal, iron, raw silk, cotton, gold, and other raw materials,\r\nthe exports of manufactured goods. The value of the imports exceeds that\r\nof the exports by no less a sum than six and a half millions sterling\r\n(Federal Statistics, 1887), the counterbalance being supplied by the\r\ntourists, and by the interest on foreign investments. The Swiss are a\r\nstirring and business-like people, and had already in the first half of\r\nthe present century carried their enterprises abroad, especially in the\r\nprincipal seaports. As early as 1812, Egg, a citizen of Zurich, took two\r\nhundred operatives, and started a cotton factory at Piedimonti, near\r\nNaples, notwithstanding the blockade, the machinery being taken by way\r\nof Trieste and the Adriatic. Now the Swiss are to be found all over the\r\nworld, as every one knows.\r\n\r\nA few figures in detail respecting the imports and exports may be\r\ninteresting. They are from the official statistics for 1887.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTS.\r\n\r\nFood stuffs                            242,935,277 francs.\r\nRaw materials                          330,324,615    \"\r\nFinished or partly-finished goods      263,775,024    \"\r\n                                       -----------\r\n                              Total    837,034,916    \"\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPORTS.\r\n\r\nFood stuffs                             78,565,548 francs.\r\nRaw materials                           95,922,106    \"\r\nFinished products                      496,604,979    \"\r\n                                       -----------\r\n                              Total    671,092,633    \"\r\n\r\nSwitzerland imports chiefly from the neighbouring countries, but her\r\nexport trade is largely with England and America, as well as with\r\nGermany and France. Of the industries of the country, the largest as\r\nwell as the oldest is the production of silk goods, dating back to the\r\nthirteenth century, the chief seats being Zurich and Basel. Cotton\r\nmanufacture is carried on at Zurich, Aargau, St. Gall, and other places;\r\nembroidery is made at St. Gall and Appenzell; and watches at Neuchatel\r\nand Geneva. This last town has also a great trade in jewellery and\r\nmusical boxes. Then there are considerable manufactures of machinery,\r\ncheese, condensed milk, and other things, and wood carving is carried on\r\nto a large extent. The last returns give the exports of silk as\r\n198,768,230 francs, cotton as over 158,000,000, and watches over\r\n84,000,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"VICTIMS OF THE WORK,\" ST. GOTHARD TUNNEL, FROM A\r\nBAS-RELIEF BY VELA.\r\n\r\n(_Photographed by Guler. By permission of the Sculptor._)]\r\n\r\nThis is not the place for details respecting the railway system, but it\r\nmay be noted that the total length of the Swiss lines is now over three\r\nthousand kilometres. A special feature of the Alpine lines is, as every\r\none is aware, the skill with which the engineering difficulties have\r\nbeen surmounted. The St. Gothard line, with its fifty tunnels, is the\r\nmost conspicuous of these successes. This grand international enterprise\r\nowes its execution to Dr. Alfred Escher of Zurich, and the famous\r\nengineer, Louis Favre of Geneva. Vela, the Ticinese sculptor, has\r\nproduced a fine group of relievi as a memento of the many poor victims\r\nof the great undertaking. The tunnel is between nine and ten miles long,\r\nand was completed in seven and a half years.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the thriving condition of Switzerland is chiefly\r\ndue to three causes--the thriftiness of the people, their natural\r\nability, and perhaps, more than all, the excellence of the educational\r\nsystem. On this last point much has been written by the late Matthew\r\nArnold and Sir F. O. Adams, and to their works the reader must be\r\nreferred for details. We may here mention, however, that besides the\r\nprimary, secondary, and high schools, which are to be found in every\r\ncanton, Switzerland stands out conspicuously by the number and\r\nexcellence of its technical and trade schools. The great Polytechnikum\r\nof Zurich is the pride of the country, and Basel, Zurich, Bern, and\r\nGeneva have universities, and Neuchatel and Lausanne academies.[108]\r\nPrimary education is entirely free, and to it the greater share of the\r\neducation vote is assigned--in 1887, nearly seventeen and a half million\r\nfrancs out of a total of twenty-six and a half millions given to\r\neducation. Attendance at school is compulsory, and there were in 1887,\r\n467,597 children attending the primary schools.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTRAIT OF GOTFRIED KELLER, THE POET.\r\n\r\n(_After a Photograph._)]\r\n\r\nOf men of intellect, of talent, of artistic, scientific, or literary\r\nskill, Switzerland has produced many, and has sheltered many more. The\r\nnumerous academical institutions, literary, scientific, and musical\r\nsocieties, draw together large numbers of superior intellects. Amongst\r\nthe numberless men of science now or lately living may be mentioned\r\nAgassiz, Desor, De la Rive, Heer, Merian, Studer, and Dr. Ferdinand\r\nKeller, the discoverer of the lake dwellings. In literature we have\r\nViet, Marc Monnier, Zschokke, as well as Leuthold, Gotfried Keller, and\r\nFerdinand Meyer. Keller has a reputation more than European; he has been\r\ncalled the German Shakespeare. He belongs to Zurich. The occasion of his\r\nseventieth birthday (on July, 1889), brought a remarkable demonstration.\r\nThe Assembly voted him an address, and enthusiastic congratulations\r\npoured in upon him from all quarters. From Germany Von Moltke himself\r\nheaded the list of admiring friends who sent messages. Keller is\r\nacknowledged to be the greatest living German poet. Amongst painters are\r\nCalaine, Diday, Girardet, Gleyre, Vautier, and Boecklin, whom the Germans\r\nconsider one of their greatest living painters; and of sculptors, there\r\nare Vela and Lanz. Gustave Weber and Joachim Raff are well-known musical\r\ncomposers, with whom we must name Baumgartner, who has raised Keller's\r\n\"Oh, mein Heimatland,\" into the position of a second national anthem.\r\n\r\nWe see in Switzerland a nation which once played a conspicuous part in\r\nEuropean military affairs, but which has now become a land of peace,\r\nwhose neutrality the Powers vouchsafed at the Vienna Congress. In the\r\nexceptional position she holds, she deems it part of her mission of\r\npeace to promote the general welfare of the world, so far as lies in her\r\npower. Most important international institutions owe their origin, or at\r\nleast their successful establishment, to Switzerland. Thus she started\r\nthe Geneva Convention, under the presidency of General Dufour, in 1864.\r\nThis Convention had for its object the mitigation of the horrors of war,\r\nand every European nation was represented at it. The declaration of the\r\nneutrality of all nurses, medical men, hospitals, &c., on either side,\r\nand the adoption of the distinguishing badge, the Geneva cross, are too\r\nwell known to need description here. Then at the suggestion of Germany\r\nthe International Postal Union was founded at a meeting at Bern. And\r\nquite recently the International Congress of labour delegates is under\r\nconsideration to be called with the view of settling some of the social\r\nquestions affecting labour. A particularly interesting Swiss foundation\r\nwas started in 1886, to provide for poor soldiers incapacitated by war,\r\nand to assist relatives dependent on those killed in battle. It was\r\nfounded to celebrate the five-hundredth anniversary of Sempach, and is\r\nappropriately named the _Winkelriedstiftung_.\r\n\r\nThe right to offer an asylum in time of war she considers one of her\r\nmost precious privileges. Seeing, however, how frequently her well-meant\r\nintentions are misinterpreted, and her hospitality abused, she may\r\nprobably have to restrict her offers of asylum. In fact, the Bundesrath\r\nhave even now under consideration the question of how best to maintain\r\nher rights in this respect, whilst seeing that no injury is done to\r\nforeign interests. One thing is certain, she will not give up the right\r\nof asylum. Meanwhile the refractory foreign elements residing in\r\nSwitzerland are not only endangering her safety, but doing harm to the\r\ncharacter of her people. The confusion of 1848-9 brought to Swiss\r\nterritory fugitives from all parts of Europe. As many as ten thousand\r\nfled from the Grand Duchy of Baden, when the Prussian troops checked the\r\nrising there. Many distinguished men, who would otherwise have met with\r\ndeath, or lingered indefinitely in prison, found a safe retreat in\r\nSwitzerland. We need only mention the great composer, Richard Wagner,\r\nand Ruestow, Mommsen, Semper, Joh. Scherr, Kinkel, Koechly, from amongst a\r\nhost of scholars who took refuge there, and settled for years at the\r\nSwiss universities. Koechly's scholarship and activity brought in a\r\nconspicuously successful period of classical study at Zurich University\r\n(1850-64),[109] and his successor, Arnold Hug, was no less devoted and\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 Austria turned out six thousand Swiss (Ticinese) in the harshest\r\nmanner from Lombardy, on the plea that Italians had been allowed to\r\ncombine on Swiss ground against Austria. Six years later the Swiss had\r\nan opportunity of heaping coals of fire on the head of Austria, for when\r\nthe Austrian garrison was driven from Fort Laveno, on Lake Maggiore,\r\nthe soldiers were not only freely admitted into Swiss territory, but\r\nwere liberally treated. Mazzini, too, the Italian patriot, sought safety\r\nin Switzerland, causing her, by the way, considerable trouble. The\r\nFranco-German war, again, offered the Swiss many opportunities of\r\nshowing their usual benevolence and charity towards distressed\r\nforeigners. To the Germans who had to leave France on the outbreak of\r\nwar, making their way home through Switzerland, the Swiss people showed\r\ninnumerable kindnesses, many of the people being poor, and destitute of\r\neven necessaries. And when they heard of the siege of Strasburg, their\r\nold friend and ally of centuries ago, the Swiss sent a deputation to\r\ninvite the weak and tender to go home with them. This was done with the\r\nconsent of both belligerents, and fourteen hundred persons, chiefly\r\nwomen and children, and old men, accepted the invitation. It was a\r\ntouching scene when they left with their protectors, and few eyes were\r\ndry. Every one knows how Bourbaki, failing to relieve Belfort, was\r\ncompelled to flee into Swiss territory, with his eighty-five thousand\r\nmen and nine thousand horses (February 1, 1871). The troops were\r\ndisarmed, and quartered all over the country, and remained till peace\r\nwas concluded. High and low, rich and poor, the Swiss vied with each\r\nother in showing kindness to the refugees. Miserable in the extreme had\r\nbeen their condition on their arrival, but they left recruited in\r\nhealth, improved in appearance and full of gratitude. As they departed\r\nthe air was filled with shouts of \"Vive la Suisse.\" That same spring,\r\ntoo, when seed was wanting with which to sow the ground in many\r\ndistricts of France, the Swiss sent large quantities of potatoes, oats,\r\nbarley, and beans, and other seed corn, besides money and clothing. And\r\nduring the war Swiss aid was distributed amongst French and Germans\r\nimpartially.\r\n\r\nIt is not from self-interest or vain-glory that the Swiss act thus, but\r\nfrom motives of humanity and benevolence. And, though the \"right of\r\nasylum\" is liable to be abused, its nobler side is not to be forgotten.\r\nIt is to be hoped that Switzerland will ever keep her present\r\nindependence and neutrality, the very existence of which bears witness\r\nto the more human tendencies of modern European politics.\r\n\r\nIt remains only to give a few figures respecting the present numbers of\r\nthe population. They are taken from the official returns, and though the\r\nreport is only provisional,[110] it may be taken that the figures are\r\nsubstantially correct. It appears, then, that the total population of\r\nthe Republic, on December 1, 1888, was 2,934,057 actually, or 2,920,723\r\nin regular residence. In 1850 the actual population was 2,392,740, thus\r\nthe increase during the thirty-eight years has been over half a million.\r\nOf the 2,934,057 enumerated on December 1, 1888, 1,427,377 were males,\r\nand 1,506,680 females; 2,092,530 were German-speaking, 637,972\r\nFrench-speaking, 156,606 Italian-speaking, 38,375 Romansch-speaking,\r\n8,574 were of other nationalities; 1,724,957 were Protestants, 1,190,008\r\nCatholics, and 19,092 of other religions, or of none. The canton with\r\nthe largest population was Bern, with 539,271, Zurich coming next with\r\n339,014, whilst that with the smallest number of souls was Lower\r\nUnterwalden, with 12,524. The most populous town is Zurich, with 90,111\r\ninhabitants, those coming next in order being Basel, with over 69,000,\r\nGeneva 52,000, Bern, 45,000, Lausanne, 33,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF LAUSANNE CATHEDRAL.\r\n\r\n(_From a Photograph._)]\r\n\r\nHere must end our short sketch of this remarkable little state. From the\r\nvery earliest times its peoples have been particularly interesting--from\r\nits prehistoric lakemen with their almost unique series of settlements,\r\ndown through successive nationalities of Helvetians and Romans, Alamanni\r\nand Burgundians to the modern Germans, French, Italians, and Romansch.\r\nSwitzerland has bred or has been closely connected with some of the\r\nproudest ruling families in European history--Habsburgs and Zaerings,\r\nCarlovingians and Burgundians, Hohenstaufens and Savoys. Some of the\r\nmost glorious victories recorded in history have been gained by the\r\nlittle Swiss nation in defence of their beloved fatherland; the fame of\r\nMorgarten, Sempach, Grandson, and Morat is not likely to die out while\r\nEuropean civilization lasts. Constitutionally the history of Switzerland\r\nis of surpassing interest. Step by step we have seen a handful of\r\ngallant people free themselves from oppression by emperor or duke, by\r\nprince or lord, by prelate or cloister. Inch by inch the people at large\r\nhave gained their political rights from foreign overlords or from native\r\naristocracies. We have seen how a tiny confederation of three petty\r\nstates has grown into a league of eight, and then of thirteen\r\nindependent districts, and how this has developed into the federal state\r\nof twenty-two cantons of our own day. Lastly, some of the institutions\r\nof the country, notably the Initiative and the Referendum, are well-nigh\r\nunique of their kind, and certainly are of the greatest interest to the\r\nstudent of political history and development; whilst Switzerland's noble\r\nefforts for the amelioration and benefit of mankind at large cannot but\r\ncommand our admiration.\r\n\r\n    \"Il est a nous, notre libre avenir;\r\n    Morgarten, Grandson, jours de fete,\r\n    Si vous ne deviez revenir,\r\n    O Saint Jacques, O sainte defaite,\r\n    Dans ton pourpre linceul, tu nous verrais dormir.\"[111]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[108] That of Lausanne is to be made into a university.\r\n\r\n[109] \"Life of Koechly,\" by Prof. A.

Story of the Nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nMessrs. G. P. PUTNAM'S SONS take pleasure in announcing that they have\r\nin course of publication, in co-operation with Mr. T. Fisher Unwin, of\r\nLondon, a series of historical studies, intended to present in a graphic\r\nmanner the stories of the different nations that have attained\r\nprominence in history.\r\n\r\nIn the story form the current of each national life is distinctly\r\nindicated, and its picturesque and noteworthy periods and episodes are\r\npresented for the reader in their philosophical relation to each other\r\nas well as to universal history.\r\n\r\nIt is the plan of the writers of the different volumes to enter into the\r\nreal life of the peoples, and to bring them before the reader as they\r\nactually lived, labored, and struggled--as they studied and wrote, and\r\nas they amused themselves. In carrying out this plan, the myths, with\r\nwhich the history of all lands begins, will not be overlooked, though\r\nthese will be carefully distinguished from the actual history, so far as\r\nthe labors of the accepted historical authorities have resulted in\r\ndefinite conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of the different volumes have been planned to cover\r\nconnecting and, as far as possible, consecutive epochs or periods, so\r\nthat the set when completed will present in a comprehensive narrative\r\nthe chief events in the great STORY OF THE NATIONS; but it is, of\r\ncourse, not always practicable to issue the several volumes in their\r\nchronological order.\r\n\r\nThe \"Stories\" are printed in good readable type, and in handsome 12mo\r\nform. They are adequately illustrated and furnished with maps and\r\nindexes. They are sold separately at a price of $1.50 each.\r\n\r\nThe following volumes are now ready (April, 1890):\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF GREECE. Prof. JAS. A. HARRISON.\r\n \"    \"   \"  ROME.
