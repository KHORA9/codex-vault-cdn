At\r\nthe time of his recall no despatch giving the reason for this step was\r\npublished, but a letter dealing with this matter has since appeared as\r\nan Appendix in the _Official History_ of the war; it is with reluctance\r\nthat I have been persuaded to reprint this letter at the end of this\r\nvolume.  It seemed, however, that Sir William's previous career was\r\nsuch a large factor in determining any opinion regarding his later work\r\nthat some account of the man and his surroundings from the beginning\r\nwould not be without interest.\r\n\r\nIn preparing the first half of this story I have been entirely\r\ndependent on the recollections of others, and have studiously avoided\r\nany attempt to eke out the material with an imaginary amplification; in\r\nthe latter half my own personal knowledge of himself and his affairs\r\nhas enabled {x} me to seek my information from numerous sources, and to\r\ndraw the portrait in richer colours on a more suggestive background.\r\n\r\nI wish to acknowledge in full the loyal assistance afforded me by my\r\nhusband's friends.  In every case I have received the most cordial\r\nresponse and co-operation.  I am sincerely grateful both to those who\r\nhave asked me to refrain from naming them and to those who have given\r\nme the support of their names.  Through the courtesy of these officers\r\nand others, I am able to say that every word has been read by one who\r\nhas personal knowledge of the incidents recorded.  In this way I trust\r\nthat this narrative will have acquired an unimpeachable accuracy.\r\n\r\nI am also deeply indebted to the _Official History of the War in South\r\nAfrica_.  Indeed, before the publication of this authoritative\r\nstatement my task would have been impossible.\r\n\r\nTo the facts therein recorded I have added extracts from officers'\r\nreports, and from Sir William's own letters, and also the words of\r\ncertain important telegrams which I had found amongst his papers, and\r\nfor the reproduction of which official permission has been graciously\r\naccorded.\r\n\r\n{xi}\r\n\r\nI beg the indulgence of the reader for faults of literary inexperience,\r\nand trust that he will recognise my honest endeavour to handle the\r\nfacts fairly and dispassionately.\r\n\r\nBEATRIX GATACRE.\r\n\r\n_April_ 8, 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{xiii}\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nGATACRE . . . 1\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTO INDIA AND BACK . . . 13\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nRANGOON . . . 38\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSECUNDERABAD . . . 52\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nBLACK MOUNTAIN EXPEDITION . . . 63\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMANDALAY . . . 82\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nPOONA . . . 98\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nBOMBAY . . . 110\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nCHITBAL . . . 127\r\n\r\n\r\n{xiv}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nQUETTA . . . 145\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE PLAGUE . . . 161\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nFROM ALDERSHOT TO BERBER . . . 184\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nATBARA AND OMDURMAN . . . 198\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nCOLCHESTER . . . 214\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nCAPE COLONY . . . 221\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nORANGE FREE STATE . . . 239\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nBACK TO COLCHESTER . . . 261\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nABYSSINIA . . . 273\r\n\r\n\r\nDESPATCH, APRIL 16, 1900 . . . 286\r\n\r\nINDEX . . . 289\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{xv}\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nMAJOR-GENERAL SIR WILLIAM GATACRE, K.C.B., D.S.O.\r\n  (_Photogravure_) . . . _Frontispiece_\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLONEL W.

These Townships were Broughton, Beobridge, and Gatacre.\"[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] _Antiquities of Shropshire_, by R. W. Eyton, 1854, preface.\r\n\r\n[2] _Ibid._, vol. iii. p. 77.\r\n\r\n\r\n{2}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ancestors]\r\n\r\nThere is a well-authenticated tradition that the family established at\r\nGatacre at the time of the Conquest held their lands by tenure of\r\nmilitary service, under a grant from Edward the Confessor.  Eyton\r\nspeaks of them as \"a family of knightly rank, which, having early\r\nfeoffment in Gatacre, took its name from the place.  The period of such\r\nfeoffment it is vain to conjecture, as being beyond all record of such\r\nmatters.\"[3]\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] Eyton's _Antiquities of Shropshire_, vol. iii. p. 86.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Henry II., Sir William de Gatacre had a suit with one\r\nWalter, about half a hide of land in Great Lye: this was subject to a\r\nWager of Battle, and apparently Gatacre proved himself the better man,\r\nfor Great Lye is even now held by his descendant.  This same William\r\nappears in another record as one of the four \"Visors,\" who in July 1194\r\nhad to report to the Courts of Westminster on the validity of the\r\n\"essoign of Cecilia de Cantreyn, a litigant.  Gatacre's associates in\r\nthis duty--to which knights only were usually appointed--were Henry\r\nChristian, Philip Fitz Holegod, and William de Rudge, all his\r\nneighbours and of equal rank with himself.\"[4]\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by Sir Robert, his son; who sat on a Jury of Grand\r\nAssizes in April 1200, to try a question of right in relation to lands\r\nat Nordley Regis, at the \"Iter of the King's Justices.\"[5]\r\n\r\n\r\n[5] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tenure of the estates was in great jeopardy {3} in the life of\r\nThomas de Gatacre; for it is told how a certain Philip de Lutley, the\r\nKing's Escheator, did \"seize the estates of Gatacre, Sutton, and Great\r\nLye into the King's hand, on the ground that Thomas de Gatacre had\r\nentered upon these estates without doing homage and fealty to the\r\nCrown, and without paying his relief, so that he had occupied the same\r\nunjustly for twenty-two years and more.\"[6]  At this unfortunate moment\r\nThomas died, leaving Alice, his widow, to fight for herself and their\r\nson Thomas.  She appealed to the King (Edward III.) in Chancery, in the\r\nMichaelmas Term 1368.  There was a trial by twenty-four jurors, being\r\nknights and others in the visnage of Sutton not being kin to Alice.\r\nShe herself appeared in person at Westminster, and won her cause, for a\r\n\"King's writ of the same year commits to the same Alice, widow of\r\nThomas de Gatacre, custody of the Manor of Gatacre and the hamlet of\r\nSutton with their appurtenances.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[6] See Eyton's _Antiquities_, vol. iii. pp. 90, 91,\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grandson of the younger Thomas was called John; he flourished in\r\nthe reigns of Henry IV., Henry V., and Henry VI., and was High Sheriff\r\nof Shropshire in 1409.  In a contemporary stained-glass window now in\r\nthe hall at Gatacre there is a portrait of the same John, who is\r\ndescribed as \"Groom of the body to Henry VIth.\"  He was succeeded by\r\nhis son John, who was Member of Parliament for Bridgnorth in the\r\ntwelfth year of Edward IV.\r\n\r\n{4}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The ancient house]\r\n\r\nThe house at Gatacre stands in the parish of Claverley, and is about\r\ntwo miles distant from this village.  Inside the church--a red\r\nsandstone building full of interest to the archæologist--are many\r\nmonuments, of which the most ancient are two incised marble slabs\r\ninlaid in the eastern wall; these are about six feet high.  On one is\r\nshown a man in armour, elaborate and perfect in all its detail,\r\ncommemorating William Gatacre, who died in 1577, and his wife and\r\neleven children; and on the other his successor Francis, 1599, is\r\ndepicted in civilian dress with his wife at his side.\r\n\r\nClose by is a very fine alabaster tomb on which lie three full-length\r\nrecumbent figures, being the effigies of Robert Brooke of Madeley\r\nCourt, who is described as \"Recorder of London, Speaker of P'lyament,\r\nand Chiefe Justice of Com'on Pleace,\" and his two wives, one of whom\r\nwas a daughter of Gatacre.[7]\r\n\r\n\r\n[7] See _Shropshire_, by A. C. Hare, p. 319.\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas, brother to Francis named above, was destined by his parents for\r\nthe law; but he \"diverted his mind from the most profitable to the most\r\nnecessary study, from law to divinity,\" and, much to the grief of his\r\nparents, who were of the old persuasion, embraced the Reformed Faith,\r\nand became Rector of St. Edmond's, Lombard Street.  He died in 1593;\r\nbut his son and grandson followed the same profession.  The former,\r\nThomas (1574-1654), was a friend of Archbishop Ussher, and a member of\r\nthe Westminster Assembly of Divines.  {5} He took part in preparing the\r\nannotations to the English Bible, and published a work on Marcus\r\nAurelius; in 1648 he subscribed the Remonstrance against the trial of\r\nCharles I.  His son, Charles, was Chaplain to Lucius Gary, Viscount\r\nFalkland, and was also the author of many books.[8]  This younger\r\nbranch of the family settled at Mildenhall, in Suffolk, and has always\r\nspelt the name Gataker.  Though there has never failed a male heir to\r\nthe senior line, this is the only cadet branch that has survived.\r\n\r\n\r\n[8] See quotation by A. C. Hare, from Thomas Fuller, 1662.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe house inhabited by this ancient family was a unique survival of\r\nvery early times.[9] Where we should now use iron girders our ancestors\r\nused oak-trees; they erected them upside-down, so that the roots made\r\narches on which to lay the roof.  Large stones were hewn to fill in the\r\nwalls, and in this particular building the outer surface of the stones\r\nwas incrusted with a transparent green glaze, very similar to what is\r\nnow seen on rough pottery.  This curious specimen of domestic\r\narchitecture survived in a habitable condition till the early part of\r\nthe eighteenth century, when it was wantonly destroyed, and replaced by\r\na brick mansion of the dark and uninteresting type of the early\r\nGeorges.  Portions of the glazed stones are still preserved in the\r\nhouse amongst many other relics of more obvious value.\r\n\r\n\r\n[9] See _The Severn Valley_, by John Randall, 1882, and _Archæologia_,\r\niii. 112, quoted by him.\r\n\r\n\r\n{6}\r\n\r\nColonel Edward Gatacre and his only son, born in 1806 (who figures as\r\nthe Squire in this narrative), were specimens of the best type of\r\ncountry gentleman of their day.  The former was twentieth in direct\r\ndescent from Sir William de Gatacre of the twelfth century, and was\r\ngrandfather to Sir William, the hero of this story.  The pedigree shows\r\nthat through the centuries the family had maintained their status as\r\ngentle-folk, and had allied themselves with other families of the same\r\nstanding in the neighbouring counties.  Both were men of remarkable\r\nactivity and considerable cultivation.  With the advent of railways\r\ncame the facility for travel, of which the younger man was quick to\r\navail himself.  He visited London every year, and among other men of\r\nrenown knew Sir Francis Grant, P.R.A., and persuaded him to come and\r\npaint the portrait of his father that still hangs at Gatacre--a\r\nbeautiful picture.  He also went abroad, and made a pilgrimage to Rome\r\nin the old days when people travelled in their own carriages, making a\r\nlong stay at many places of interest in Switzerland and Italy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Forbes]\r\n\r\nAt the age of eighty-one the Colonel died, sincerely mourned throughout\r\nthe county; and thus in 1849 the young Squire came into his\r\ninheritance.  About ten years earlier he had married Jessie, second\r\ndaughter of William Forbes of Callendar, in the county of Stirling.\r\nMr. Forbes, who sprang from a cadet branch of the family of that name,\r\nstarted his career in a shipping office; by his enterprise and\r\ninventions {7} he built up a considerable fortune, with which he bought\r\nthe Callendar estate.  His elder son, William Forbes, who succeeded\r\nhim, represented Stirlingshire in Parliament for many years; and his\r\nyounger son became Colonel John Forbes of the Coldstream Guards.  Their\r\nsister Jessie must always have been a beautiful woman, rather Scottish,\r\nperhaps, in the vigorous outline of her face, with a depth about her\r\nblue eyes and a symmetry of feature that reappeared in her third son; a\r\nlook of \"all-comprehensive tenderness\" is the dominant note of the\r\nportrait.  Indeed, we are told that while Mrs. Gatacre was a very able\r\nwoman, she had a singular gentleness of manner.\r\n\r\nThe family already numbered two sons and a daughter when in 1843 Mrs.\r\nGatacre went on a visit to her widowed mother, who was then living at\r\nHerbertshire Castle, near Stirling: and so it came about that when a\r\nlittle boy was born on December 3, he was given the names of his uncle\r\nand godfather, William Forbes.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is to his Scottish descent that we may trace some of the\r\nqualities that became most marked when the child, grown to perfect\r\nmanhood, had evolved that balance of innumerable strains that go to\r\nmake the individual--had, as it were, tuned the manifold strings of his\r\nlineage to a chord of his own finding.  Did he draw his habit of\r\nconcentration on the matter in hand, his painstaking attention to\r\ndetail, from the inventor-engineer of Aberdeen?  Did he draw his\r\nfervent notions of duty {8} and his stern disregard of personal\r\nconsiderations from the blood of the Covenanters that ran in his veins?\r\nMy own father was heard to say that this son-in-law of his was born out\r\nof due time, that his right place would have been at the head of\r\nCromwell's Ironsides.\r\n\r\nIn course of time another son, Stephen, completed the family.  The\r\nchildren were a great source of pride and pleasure to their parents,\r\nand had the benefit of all that loving early training could do for\r\nthem.  In this wholesome atmosphere of parental affection and brotherly\r\ncompetition the four boys grew up straight and strong.  They vied with\r\none another in childish feats and manly sports, but in all these Willie\r\nwas the keenest and the most daring.\r\n\r\nEven in these latter days the house at Gatacre seems difficult of\r\naccess, for the nearest railway station (unless you cross the Severn in\r\na ferry) is at Bridgnorth, six miles away; but sixty years ago there\r\nwas no railway nearer than Wolverhampton, a good ten miles' drive.  The\r\neldest son well remembers his father driving his coach-and-four to and\r\nfro.  The Squire was a famous whip, and maintained this practice far\r\ninto the sixties.  But as the boys grew older they thought nothing of\r\ndoing this journey on foot at any hour of the day or night; perhaps it\r\nwas the remoteness of the country in which they were nurtured that had\r\nendowed this family for generations back with powers of physical\r\nendurance and enterprise beyond the common.\r\n\r\n{9}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: At school]\r\n\r\nThe elder brothers Edward and John[10] were sent to Mr. Hopkirk's\r\nschool at Eltham, in Kent; and both were still there when Willie joined\r\nthem a year or two later.  Some of Willie's letters from school are\r\nstill to be seen; and if handwriting is any sign of character, he must\r\nhave been an exemplary boy at his lessons, for his letters are so\r\nexquisitely written that were it not for the dates duly recorded one\r\ncould scarcely believe them to be the work of a high-spirited boy of\r\nthirteen.  Writing to his mother in March 1857, he says: \"Did you see\r\nin the papers that peace had been made with Persia?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[10] Now Major-General Sir John Gatacre, K.C.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe interest in Persia had been aroused by the approaching departure of\r\nhis brother John to India, where he was to join a regiment that was at\r\nthat moment fighting in Persia.  Though loth to part from one who was\r\nsaid to be his father's favourite son, the Squire had thought the offer\r\nof a commission in the East India Company's army too good an opening to\r\nrefuse.  In May 1857 he accompanied the boy, who was then only sixteen\r\nand a half, as far as Marseilles, and did not see him again for nearly\r\ntwelve years.\r\n\r\nAt Gatacre there was a famous kennel of setters, and also some good\r\nretrievers.  A puppy of the latter breed was given to Willie for his\r\nown, and he broke and trained it so skilfully, when only fifteen, that\r\nthe dog was sold for fifteen guineas, and eventually became celebrated\r\nin the canine world.\r\n\r\n{10}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In the holidays]\r\n\r\nThere are many excellent fox-holding coverts in that part of the\r\ncountry; the Albrighton Hounds still draw them regularly.  Such visits\r\nwere great events to the boys; and we can well believe that Willie\r\nwould always be out, mounted on whatever he could get, big or small,\r\nold or young.  One day he was riding a mare who was known to be\r\ntwenty-two years old, and had all her life been used for harness work;\r\nbut nothing stopped Willie.  When a fox was found close to the house,\r\naway he went, and it is still told how Rushlight led the field for\r\nmiles.  Willie seems to have shared more intimately than any of his\r\nbrothers the Squire's love for horses.  He had a vivid recollection of\r\njourneys to Birmingham with his father, when he visited the big stables\r\nthere to search for horses, either for himself or a friend; the elder\r\nman taught his son what points to look for and what to avoid.  Willie\r\nthus acquired a certain confident genius for judging a horse, and all\r\nhis life took a pleasure in exercising this quality; like his father\r\nbefore him, he was never afraid to buy horses at their request for\r\nfriends who had more confidence in his judgment than in their own.\r\n\r\nOne summer holiday the boy found for himself a new recreation.  In a\r\nletter to Stephen, dated from Gatacre, July 20, 1860, we find the\r\nfollowing passage:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Did you know that there was an Alderney bull come?  I have begun to\r\nwork him every {11} day, but he does not like it, and he fights with me\r\na great deal.  But I find a good stick the best remedy; sometimes I\r\nhave to bate him a good deal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brothers and sister clearly recall seeing Willie ride this animal\r\nday after day in the park.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Number Three must often have been a source of\r\nanxiety to his parents.  One evening in February he gave his mother a\r\nmost horrible fright.  The boys had arranged to go out after\r\nwood-pigeons in the spinneys round the house; as there was snow on the\r\nground they slipped a night-shirt over their clothes to make themselves\r\nless visible.  The three guns posted themselves in three coverts some\r\ndistance apart, and then lay in wait for the birds as they came in to\r\nroost.  Willie, who was then sixteen or seventeen, was in a lucky\r\ncorner: he shot so many that he was at a loss how to bring the birds\r\nin.  Slipping off his white covering, he made a bag of it and gathered\r\nup his spoils.  By the time he reached the house he presented such an\r\nalarming appearance that his mother naturally imagined him the victim\r\nof some terrible accident.  With great pride the boy counted out\r\nforty-two birds.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 the Squire was pricked for High Sheriff.  There is an ancient\r\ncustom by which all the sons of Gatacre are enrolled as Freemen of the\r\nBorough of Bridgnorth; and on June 25, 1860, William Forbes was duly\r\nsworn and inscribed on the rolls.\r\n\r\n{12}\r\n\r\nIn the same year, on August 1, he was admitted to the Royal Military\r\nCollege; he was then only sixteen and a half, and measured five feet\r\nseven and a quarter inches in height.  Ultimately he reached five feet\r\neleven inches in his socks.\r\n\r\nExcept in the riding-school he does not seem to have made much mark at\r\nSandhurst, but when he left in December 1861 he had earned the college\r\n\"Recommendation,\" and on February 18 following was gazetted an ensign\r\nin the 77th Foot, now the 2nd Battalion (Duke of Cambridge's Own)\r\nMiddlesex Regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{13}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n1862-1880\r\n\r\nTO INDIA AND BACK\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1862]\r\n\r\nThe 77th Regiment was raised in 1787, and for twenty years served in\r\nIndia, taking part in the fierce campaigns against Tippoo Sahib in\r\n1790-91, in the storming of Seringapatam in 1799, and in many minor\r\noperations.  On their colours are also recorded the suggestive names,\r\nAlbuhera, Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, Vittoria, Pyrenees, Nivelle, Nive,\r\nPeninsula.  In the Crimea they had charged at the Alma and at Inkerman;\r\nthey had shivered in the trenches before Sebastopol, and had taken part\r\nin the final assault of the Redan.  There were many officers and men\r\nstill with the colours in 1862 who had three clasps to their medals,\r\nand also wore the French medal, and in the ranks there was an\r\nexceptional number of Gallant Conduct medals.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt the fine record of the regiment and the fact that all the\r\nsenior officers had been proved in actual warfare, as their medals so\r\nbrilliantly testified, had a stimulating effect on the juniors.\r\n\r\n{14}\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the 77th sailed for Sydney, New South Wales, just before\r\nthe news of the Indian Mutiny reached England; and being detained\r\nthere, they did not reach India till June 1858, too late to take a\r\nshare in any but the minor operations incident to the disturbed state\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: As subaltern]\r\n\r\nThe regiment was at Hazaribagh, in Bengal, when Ensign William Gatacre\r\njoined on June 5, 1862, but was shortly afterwards moved to Allahabad.\r\nIt was while Gatacre was doing duty with a detachment in the Fort that\r\nMajor Henry Kent (now Colonel-in-Chief of the Middlesex Regiment) first\r\nsaw the new subaltern; he describes him as good-looking, thin, smart,\r\nand gentlemanly, adding that he took an immediate fancy to him.\r\n\r\nIt is to General Kent, who still speaks of Gatacre with great\r\naffection, that I am indebted for the following story.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Napier, who at that time was Military Member of Council, was\r\npassing through Allahabad on tour that winter, and took a walk round\r\nthe Fort one evening.  Seeing a smart young officer with the famous\r\n77th on his cap, he accosted him.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" he said, \"I see you belong to the 77th, which Lord Gough\r\ncommanded at the battle of Barrosa.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you captured a French Eagle there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, we did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Napier, \"what have you done {15} with the French Eagle?\r\nHave you got it out here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at present, sir,\" came the audacious reply: \"we are putting up a\r\nmemorial in St. Paul's Cathedral to all our poor fellows who fell in\r\nthe Crimea, and we have sent the Eagle home to have a model taken of\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nNow all this was an imaginary story invented to ease the situation, for\r\nNapier was wrong in his facts.  It was the 87th that Lord Gough had\r\ncommanded, and the 87th who had captured the French Standard; but\r\nGatacre's intuitive sense of discipline, even at nineteen, led him to\r\ntry any way of escape before putting his senior in the wrong.\r\n\r\nMajor-General Sir Harcourt Bengough, who was a few years senior to\r\nGatacre in the regiment, writes thus:\r\n\r\n\"The impression I retain of him as a young soldier is that of a strong\r\nwill and a quick determination to succeed, combined with a very kindly\r\ndisposition and a great charm of manner.\"\r\n\r\nAnother officer tells us that in the hottest weather Gatacre was always\r\ncool, smiling, and good-tempered.  He was noticeably abstemious and\r\nfrugal, and very careful of his appearance.  At one time he used to\r\nclean his own boots because he was too hard up to pay for this service.\r\nWhen he related this in after-life he added, with the pride of\r\nefficiency, \"And they did shine!\"\r\n\r\nAn officer's wife who knew Gatacre in these early days, and saw him at\r\nintervals throughout {16} his career, tells us that there hung about\r\nhim when he first joined a certain countrified simplicity of mind and\r\nmanner, as opposed to the conventionality of a town-bred man.  Though\r\nhe enjoyed society, social distractions got little hold on his\r\nself-contained nature, and it was rarely that any of his friendships\r\ndeveloped into intimacy.  He had, however, a ready sympathy, was easily\r\ninterested in whatever went on around him, and, being very unselfish,\r\nwas always prepared to do any one a service.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1865]\r\n\r\nYoung Gatacre's letters to his mother from Allahabad disclose a\r\nreasoned industry inspired by ambition.  The reiteration of the\r\nrecurring features of his life, cholera, rain, and work, is suggestive\r\nof the monotony of existence in the summer months.  But his experiences\r\nand his surroundings differ in nothing from that of every other\r\nsubaltern in the Plains.  That he worked with assiduity at acquiring\r\nthe language is shown by his having been placed first out of twenty-two\r\nin the Higher Standard, after only two years' study.  When the 77th\r\nmoved to Bareilly, Gatacre was made secretary to the Mutton and Poultry\r\nClub, and kept a quailery, which was a venture of his own.  The\r\nfollowing letter shows the real interest that he took in his charges:\r\n\r\n\r\n_July_ 31, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"When the musketry instructor comes down from leave on September 30, I\r\nshall try for fifteen days' leave.  I cannot get more, as the {17}\r\ncourse begins on October 15, with all its hard work.  It is raining\r\nvery hard here, and I am sitting in the verandah watching all my ducks\r\nand geese enjoying themselves.  I have both my horses in the field\r\nround the house: one of them has a peculiarly unpleasant temper with\r\nstrangers.  The other day the doctor was breakfasting with us; when he\r\nwent away and had got a short distance, he saw this animal coming at\r\nhim open-mouthed, but he turned and ran for my room, and both the\r\ndoctor and horse came into the room together.  He does not run at me,\r\nas he knows me so well, but I never trust him much; they are very\r\nuncertain in India.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On leave]\r\n\r\nIn November 1866 the 77th was sent to Peshawur, and in the following\r\nMay young Gatacre took six months' leave to Kashmir.  But he did not\r\nconfine himself to shooting in the Happy Valley; he was filled with an\r\nadventurous curiosity to see the temples and wild scenery of the\r\nmountains beyond.  He felt that his pleasure in the trip would lie in\r\nhis freedom to go where he chose, and when he chose, and as fast as he\r\nchose.  He knew that his mobility would outstrip that of any companion,\r\nand so decided to go alone.  In this decision, in which we see the\r\nfirst indication of originality, Gatacre showed a fearlessness, a\r\nconfidence in his own resources, and a willingness to sever\r\ncommunications with all external support that are remarkable in a lad\r\nof only twenty-three.  These characteristics never faded; they may be\r\ntraced throughout the record of his life {18} whenever occasion arose\r\nfor his individuality to take action.  What other man would have\r\nattempted to explore the forests of Abyssinia unaccompanied at the age\r\nof sixty-one!  His fearlessness and his confidence were with him to the\r\nend, and to the end he preserved a mobility that preferred to be\r\nunhampered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1867]\r\n\r\nYoung Gatacre's first objective was Leh.  He left Srinagar on May 2,\r\nand halting at Manasbal Lake one night, reached Kangan.  Here he learnt\r\nthat the road over the Zoji-La between Sonamarg and Dras was still\r\nblocked with snow, and so made up his mind to halt for a time.  His\r\ndiary during this fortnight's halt shows that he was more interested in\r\nwhat he saw than in what he shot.  This is the feature of his trip; he\r\nwrites much more of the temples that he has sketched than of the game\r\nthat he has killed.  One day when he had run across some friends he\r\nwrites: \"Saw a gerau deer that Troop had killed; would like to get one\r\nto make a sketch of.\"  He subsequently collected many of his sketches\r\nin a book; and these early water-colours are quite surprising in their\r\nfreshness and finish.  They are not pictures, but most painstaking\r\nstudies of what he saw--picturesque men and women, animals, temples,\r\nidols, and occasionally the detail of some designs from the temples.\r\nHe records with the greatest interest the flowers and birds that he\r\nsees, and speaks of its physical features if the country he was passing\r\nthrough was of special interest.  It is clear that he had at some time\r\nstudied the elements of geology, {19} for he writes of the Zoji-La:\r\n\"Rocks very barren, and look very old--no sharp points.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Goes after bear]\r\n\r\nAfter ten days he moved one march up the road to Reval, and spent ten\r\ndays there shooting, whenever the rain and the snow allowed.  On May 16\r\nhe writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Fine morning at last; put everything in the sun to dry.  Went out\r\nshooting after breakfast, and had a good day; killed a black bear about\r\n200 yards from camp.  Had a shot at an ibex; saw nine, but did not hit\r\none.  Slept under a tree for about an hour; on my way back killed a\r\nbrown bear with a beautiful silvery skin, and hit a barrasingh buck in\r\nthe chest; tracked him a long way, found some blood.  Night was coming\r\non and it began to rain, so had to give up the search or should\r\nprobably have got him--a magnificent beast, horns about a foot high,\r\njust beginning to grow.  In jumping across the stream I fell in and got\r\nwet through; water very strong, was carried down like an arrow; caught\r\nhold of a stone and came ashore, took off my things and stood in the\r\nsun to dry: sketch reserved.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a pleasant vein of boyish humour in some of the entries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Went after a huge black bear that we saw on the hill-side, but could\r\nnot find him.  Climbed one of the stiffest and most slippery hills that\r\nI ever was on after the aforesaid bear, and found his cave.  Thought\r\nhim a fool for selecting such a spot; going up there once was bad\r\nenough, but to have such an ascent to one's residence was absurd.\r\nFound some one of the name of {20} Thorpe had arrived at the\r\ncamping-ground, asked him to dinner, but he refused as he was so tired;\r\ncould not understand his reason--the very one why I should have\r\naccepted, as he could have gone to bed directly afterwards, my dinner\r\nbeing ready and his not.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not till May 23 that he got really started, and even then the\r\nroad was still deep in snow, or the melting snow was flooding over the\r\nroad in many places.  Under date May 25 we read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Passed some dead men in the pass; they were men going to Yarkand\r\n(eight men and a woman) several days ago, when they were overtaken with\r\nsnow and smothered, all their bedding, clothes, etc., lying about.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day, writing from Dras, he notices the great change that has come\r\nover the country; and here he spent three days, partly because his\r\nservant had fever, and partly because he finds so much to sketch that\r\nhe cannot tear himself away.  The same motive kept him at Lama Guru, of\r\nwhich he gives an excellent description.  He reached Leh on June 9,\r\nhaving accomplished the 250 miles from Reval in seventeen days, or\r\ndeducting four halts, thirteen days; which works out at an average of\r\nover nineteen miles every marching day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: At Hemis]\r\n\r\nThe following day he started off for Hemis, where there was a great\r\ngathering for the visit of the Burra Lama: this involved a stony and\r\narduous march of twenty-four miles, but he was {21} up early next\r\nmorning and was very much interested in what was going on.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June_ 11, 1867.\r\n\r\n\"Went all over the Monastery and gained a little information--not much,\r\nas the monks keep no records, only from year to year.  The place is\r\nabout 1,300 years old, well built of stone with a whitening on it, on\r\nthe side of a rock.  There are several halls of worship (Gompas) hung\r\nround with splendid silk flags and banners, all Chinese silk.  There\r\nare a few idols, but very small ones, magnificently woven pictures of\r\ngods on silk being the chief things.  About 10 o'clock the tamasha\r\nbegan, monks dressed in the most magnificent silk garments and quaint\r\ntall hats and masks dancing; the costumes were varied about every\r\nquarter of an hour and every one equally grand as the former.  They\r\neach held in their hands a drum like a warming-pan and either a bell or\r\na rattle.  They danced a sort of war-dance in a circle, occasionally\r\nsinging and drumming.  Under the verandah of the Quadrangle were seated\r\nabout thirty monks dressed in red and yellow silk gowns, with\r\nfan-shaped hats on their heads; some with drums, some with cymbals, and\r\nsome with long trumpets, silver and copper, formed the band; they\r\nplayed from music and it went very well with the wild dance.  One dance\r\nwas performed with bears, another was supposed to be a wild man's\r\ndance: about ten monks--dressed in hideous masks, yellow embroidered\r\nsilk jackets, on the shoulders of which tigers' heads were embroidered,\r\nand round whose waists were strings of bells, from which were suspended\r\nstrips of tiger skins--danced in a circle, beating drums and ringing\r\nbells.  The figure of a man {22} bound hand and foot was placed in the\r\ncentre.  After they had danced round the figure some time, one of them\r\ncut off his head with a sword.  One of the side walls of the\r\nQuadrangle, about 30 ft. high and 12 ft. broad, was covered with a\r\nsingle cloth or flag on which was most beautifully woven the figure of\r\none of their gods and other subjects--worth about 5,000 or 6,000\r\nrupees.  This was at first covered with long silk streamers, which were\r\nremoved; and when the large banner had been duly worshipped and\r\nadmired, it was rolled up and replaced by another equally splendid, but\r\nnot so large, by a third and by a fourth.  Each dress could not have\r\ncost less than £80 or £100--I never saw anything so magnificent; the\r\nwhole Quadrangle was hung round with silk streamers too.  Round the\r\nQuadrangle, the prayer-books--viz. rollers of wood with the prayers\r\nwritten on them--are placed, one turn of which is equal to saying a\r\nprayer.  All the villagers have them at their doors; at one corner of\r\nthe Quadrangle there is a room in which there is a huge prayer roller.\r\nThey are called Marni-prayer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGatacre was determined to make the most of his opportunities, and\r\ninsisted on seeing the Burra Lama, whom he thus describes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He is a short, stout, middle-aged man, clothed in fine scarlet cloth,\r\nsitting on a throne on which incense was burning; he is never seen by\r\nany one except on the occasion of the festival, when he comes and sits\r\non a platform in the Quadrangle for about half an hour.  I could not\r\nwait till evening to see him, so as a special favour was allowed to see\r\nthe mortal whom no vulgar European eye had seen before.  He {23}\r\nreceived me graciously, and asked me to be seated and how I was; asked\r\nme if I had anything to give him.  I had brought nothing from Ladak\r\nwith me, but had some matches with me, which I gave him.  He comes from\r\nLhassa; it is three months' journey from here, and he comes once in\r\nevery five or six years.  It was great luck my seeing this festival, as\r\noccurring so early in the year it is seldom or never seen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Salt Lakes]\r\n\r\nOn his return to Leh, Gatacre was horrified at getting letters telling\r\nhim to hurry back to Peshawur, as cholera had broken out.  But he was\r\ntoo cunning to take this very literally, and at once got his friend the\r\nWazeer to lend him ponies to ride to the Salt Lakes; he adds most\r\nsapiently: \"If I don't see them now, probably never shall.\"\r\n\r\nIt was, however, a very long way (ninety-eight miles) to the Salt Lakes\r\nat Rupshu; he did this journey in two days, and on the second day\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The distance I came to-day was fifty-eight miles; I was nearly dead\r\nwith fever, and sun and cold, and walking, and riding in a wooden\r\nsaddle all day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHe spent one day in his tent with fever on the snow-covered plain, but\r\nwas better next morning and able to get about, and on the following day\r\nhe started on the return journey, which he accomplished in two marches\r\nas before.\r\n\r\nAfter four days spent at Leh with some friends who had turned up, he\r\nmarched back by the same {24} route, covering 265 miles from Leh to\r\nKangan in twelve days, one of which was a halt at Lama Yuru, where he\r\n\"slept nearly all day.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Off again]\r\n\r\nWriting from Baltal on July 1, he comments on the change that has taken\r\nplace in the Zoji-La in his absence:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Pir is a very different-looking place from what it was when I came\r\nthrough it before.  Then it was a wilderness of snow, ice, and rocks;\r\nnow it is the most beautiful pass, hills covered with grass and flowers\r\nand shrubs and trees that were before buried in the snow.  The snow\r\nrivers are very full and furious; nearly lost a pony in one of them;\r\ndrove him through it and carried saddles, etc., over the snow some way\r\nhigher up; the pony was rolled over and over and with difficulty came\r\nto land.  Now that the snow has disappeared, one sees what a quantity\r\nthere must have been in the pass when I went through, at least 70 or 80\r\nft. in some places.  The Pir is covered with sweet peas and flowers of\r\nall colours and shapes, excessively pretty.\r\n\r\n\"The hills wear a quite different aspect to what they did when I came\r\nup.  The snow has melted except on a few of the highest peaks, and the\r\ngrass has grown, likewise the shrubs.  The barley and all the corn is\r\nin the ear; it was hardly sown when I came, just a month ago.  There\r\nare waterfalls from nearly every rock, which looks very pretty and the\r\nwater is such as 'only teetotallers desire or deserve.'  The wild\r\nroses, white, red, and yellow, are covered with blossoms, and their\r\nsmell is delicious.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut before he reached Srinagar the orders for his return were\r\ncancelled, and we find him shooting in his old haunts round Kangan.\r\n\r\n{25}\r\n\r\nIt is clear that he was enjoying himself thoroughly, that he felt no\r\nimpatience to return to civilisation, and that he considered his march\r\nto Leh and back very much worth doing, for at the end of July he\r\nstarted on another extended tour.  It is about 120 miles from Kangan to\r\nSkardo, about 200 thence to Leh, and about 250 from Leh to Srinagar, so\r\nthat he added another 570 miles to his score in the fifty days between\r\nJuly 28 and September 15.  Leaving the Sind River by the tributary\r\nvalley to the north called Wangat, he crossed into the valley of Tylel\r\nby a little-known route \"said to have been a track made by a gang of\r\nhorse dealers who came from Tylel into Kashmir years ago.\"  There were\r\ntwo very steep hills, of which the coolies only managed to accomplish\r\nthe first.\r\n\r\nTurning north-east, he made his way across the plains of Deosai, but\r\nthere was a difficult pass to negotiate before he descended into the\r\nvalley of the Indus.  On August 7 he writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Got up early and started for Skardo.  Got to the top of the ridge in\r\nabout an hour, all snow and ice, great trouble to get the ponies over\r\nthe glacier, as it was a nearly perpendicular sheet of ice--they slid\r\ndown most of the way.  From the bottom of the glacier there is a\r\ndescent of about eight miles down the valley, which opens out into the\r\nplain of Skardo.  Skardo consists of a number of villages scattered\r\nover a stony plain covered with apricot-trees which yield great\r\nquantities of fruit.  The plain is surrounded with high rocky hills, no\r\ngrass or trees on them.  The Wazeer is an old man with long {26} grey\r\nbeard, uncle to the present Wazeer Labjar of Ladak, who was formerly\r\nWazeer here.  His name is Myraram, he came to see me on my arrival,\r\nbringing a large basket of apricots as a present.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A snow pass]\r\n\r\nThe last sentence is a sample of many entries, for wherever he went he\r\nmade friends with the headmen of the village, and he seems nowhere to\r\nhave been in difficulties about supplies.  As it is unlikely that the\r\nHindustani of the plains of India would be understood in Thibet, he\r\nmust either have mastered working fragments of the dialect, or he must\r\nhave talked Persian with the more educated natives.  Later on he says:\r\n\"Met some Tartars who had been to Simla, and had a long talk with\r\nthem.\"  And in another place: \"Had a long talk with a Sepoy who was in\r\none of the four regiments sent by the Maharajah to assist in the\r\ncapture of Delhi, and saw General Nicholson fall.\"\r\n\r\nThree officers of the 11th Hussars came in to Skardo the day after\r\nGatacre's arrival, and fired him with the desire to see Shigar, a town\r\na few miles higher up the Indus, where they had seen the original game\r\nof polo.\r\n\r\nAfter five days' halt at Skardo, Gatacre started on his return journey,\r\nvia Leh.  Both Skardo and Leh are on the Indus: he did not, however,\r\nfollow the course of this river, but chose to make his way up the\r\nvalley of the Shyok.  This necessitated a passage over the Indus at the\r\njunction of the two streams on the second day's march, which he thus\r\ndescribes:\r\n\r\n\r\n{27}\r\n\r\n\"Started at daybreak, and reached this at 6 o'clock.  Crossed the river\r\nat Kiris on twelve mussocks fastened together by eight bamboos or thin\r\nsticks--the luggage in the centre, I on one side, Collassie on the\r\nother, and two steerers at one end, who steered with long sticks.  When\r\nthey got into the middle of the stream they began their tarnasha,\r\nnamely, turning the raft round and round like a top by digging their\r\nsticks deeply into the water.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days later he crossed the Shyok in the same manner, and found the\r\nstream \"very fast and furious,\" although it was half a mile across.  It\r\nis difficult to picture these watercourses, which, with the manners and\r\nappearance of mountain-torrents, have the volume and grandeur of mighty\r\nrivers.  After following the Shyok for about fifty miles, he left it at\r\nPaxfain, and turned southwards along  the side-stream which leads up to\r\nthe Chorbat-La, a pass 16,696 ft. above the sea.  Writing that evening,\r\nhe says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Marched at break of day and walked on steadily till the sun went\r\ndown--a very long march; the first four or five hours were occupied in\r\ngetting to the top of the pass--a terrible climb--after that it is all\r\ndown-hill.  The Pir was covered with snow, with an immense glacier\r\nreaching right across it for about 200 yards.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day he struck into the valley of the Indus once more, and\r\nreached Leh in six marches on August 26.  On the way \"a very civil {28}\r\nSepoy turned up,\" who was also on his way to Ladak.  While in his\r\ncompany Gatacre found that he met with unusual politeness and\r\nattention, which was accounted for later when \"the Sepoy turned out to\r\nbe the new Thanadar of these parts.\"\r\n\r\nOn September 1 he started back on the direct route to Srinagar, which\r\nmust have seemed quite familiar to him on this, his third journey.  On\r\nthe Zoji-La he notes that \"all the grass that was so beautifully green\r\nis now withered up.\"  At Sonamarg he found it \"very cold,\" and writes\r\nof his blankets being frozen hard in the morning, and quite white.  On\r\nSeptember 15 he reached Srinagar, having marched the 285 miles from Leh\r\nin sixteen days, making an average of eighteen miles a day.  He seems\r\nto have done most of his travelling on foot, though it is clear that he\r\nsometimes had ponies for his baggage, and that he sometimes rode them.\r\nWhen he was making long marches he had great sympathy for his beasts,\r\nand often notices that the ponies were very tired.  The rate at which\r\nhe travelled would, of course, be nothing exceptional on made roads,\r\nbut it must be remembered that in no case was there any road at all, as\r\nwe understand the word, and that he habitually moved by double marches.\r\n\r\nHe found several friends at Srinagar whom he had come across in his\r\ntravels, and enjoyed an easy fortnight with them there before rejoining\r\nat Peshawur.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On sick leave]\r\n\r\nThis season had proved itself a very trying {29} and unhealthy one for\r\nthe 77th; the regiment had been attacked with cholera and Peshawur\r\nfever, and had lost five officers and forty-nine men.  Colonel Kent\r\ntells us that on his return Gatacre had a sharp attack of fever, and\r\nthat he and another subaltern had been so very ill when they were sent\r\noff home that it was feared they would never again be able to serve in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nEven after his arrival in England Gatacre had severe recurrences of\r\nfever, but home nursing triumphed; and before long he was posted to a\r\ndepot battalion then commanded by Colonel Browne of the 77th, and\r\nstationed at Pembroke Dock.  Writing on August 13, 1909, Colonel Browne\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Gatacre's relations with his brother officers were always very smooth,\r\nand I cannot recall to mind his ever exchanging an angry word with any\r\none of them, but as a rule he did not encourage intimacy.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever Gatacre was asked or had to do he did well and thoroughly.\r\nWhilst he joined heartily in whatever socially was going on, he never\r\nin the days I speak of put himself prominently forward; but there was\r\nsomething about him which I at least recognised as showing a dormant\r\npower which only awaited opportunity to exert itself, and this view of\r\nhim has been fully borne out by his later career.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Colonel Kent brought the battalion home in March 1870, Lieutenant\r\nGatacre was on the quay to greet his regiment on its arrival at\r\nPortsmouth.\r\n\r\n{30}\r\n\r\nThe Clarence Barracks in which the regiment was first quartered were at\r\nthat time old and dilapidated, and have since vanished.  In those days\r\nevery officer who took part in a route-march had to send in a report to\r\nthe General Officer Commanding.  The opening sentence of one of\r\nGatacre's reports amused his wing-commander so much that it survives:\r\n\"Starting from the Clarence Barracks, long since condemned as unfit for\r\nhabitation by the Royal Marines, etc.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1870]\r\n\r\nThe events of 1870 on the continent were of course followed with\r\nbreathless interest by all intelligent Englishmen, and many soldiers\r\nmust have longed to go and see the ground on which these sanguinary\r\ncontests had been fought out.  This desire was anticipated by the War\r\nOffice, and special regulations were issued forbidding such an attempt.\r\nBut to Gatacre the call was irresistible.  Having taken first leave\r\nthat autumn in order to see something of his brother John before his\r\nreturn to India, he slipped away via Harwich and Antwerp to Brussels,\r\nwhich he reached on November 6.  He seems afterwards to have followed\r\nthe route taken by the First German Army under Steinmetz in early\r\nAugust--in fact, Saarbrucken was the scene of the first encounter.\r\nGravelotte had been fought on August 18, but doubtless to a soldier's\r\neye the ground occupied by the combatants could still be identified.\r\nMetz had capitulated on October 27, so that the state of a city in\r\nwhich 150,000 men had been blockaded {31} for three months was\r\nexhibited in all its horrors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Continental battlefields]\r\n\r\nWriting from Luxembourg on Sunday, November 6, 1870, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I started again at 6.30 this morning, and got here, without stopping,\r\nat 1 o'clock; nothing but soldiers, horses, and baggage, besides sick\r\nmen by the hundreds, hospitals filled.  I never saw such a sight.\r\nTo-night I am going to Treves, and then on to Metz, via Saarlouis and\r\nSaarbruck, as the road via Vionville is not open on account of the\r\nFrench holding it.  I will write from Metz and let you know my\r\nmovements.  I mean to attach myself to the English Ambulance, if\r\npossible, for a while, if I can see anything more by doing so.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again on November 13, from Brussels:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"From Luxembourg I went on to Treves, Saarbruck, Metz, and then round\r\nby Ottange, through Belgium to Brussels again.  I went to Gravelotte\r\nand several battlefields, and picked up heaps of things, most of which\r\nI have got with me; but as nothing is allowed to go over the French\r\nfrontier, there was a difficulty about passing.  I met a man named\r\nCaldecott in the service, and he and I travelled together all the way;\r\nwe drove across the frontier with our things, and so got them through.\r\nMetz is in a terrible state; nothing to eat or drink, or place to\r\nsleep.  I could not write, as all postal communication is stopped, and\r\nmost of the country round Metz a desert.\r\n\r\n\"I shall come by the coach Thursday night, so if you could send the\r\ncart to Shipley to fetch my things, I will just walk over.\"\r\n\r\n{32}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1871-3]\r\n\r\nWriting on the day following his return, his sister gives Stephen a\r\nrchauffé of the traveller's tales:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Metz is not injured in the least, but is full of soldiers, and that is\r\nwhy there was no place to sleep in there.  When Willie left, the shops\r\nwere open and provisions coming in.  Willie travelled with another\r\nEnglishman in a waggon with a poor starved horse, and was going about\r\nin this way for four or five days.  The cold intense; deep snow.  He\r\nsaw 25,000 prisoners going into Germany, packed in trucks, forty\r\nofficers and men in a truck like cattle, and snow among them.  He slept\r\nin a hospital three nights, 1,700 men in it.\r\n\r\n\"I do not think, from what he says, that travelling is over safe--that\r\nis, on the French side.  The sentries are very sharp; an Englishman who\r\nwas foolishly travelling by himself, and at night, and could speak no\r\nlanguage well, was shot a month ago.\r\n\r\n\"Willie is glad he went; he met an old gentleman who knew grandpapa at\r\nSaarbruck.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is much to be regretted that the daily impressions of this tour were\r\nnot recorded with the accuracy of the Kashmir trip, but 1867 seems to\r\nhave been the only year in which he kept a journal.  We hear nothing of\r\nhow he contrived to get anything to eat, or to get about at all, in a\r\nregion stripped of supplies by the armies that had passed through; but\r\nthe interesting fact remains that he did visit this ground, and\r\nreappeared at home on Thursday, November 17.\r\n\r\nColonel Henry Kent was very popular in the 77th regiment, which he had\r\nfirst joined in 1845.  He held the command for twelve years, and {33}\r\nhad brought the battalion into a very high state of efficiency when he\r\nresigned in 1880.  It is notified in General Orders of that year that\r\nfor the third time in succession the 77th was the best shooting\r\nregiment, and that Private H. Morgan, of this corps, was the best shot\r\nin the army.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Staff College]\r\n\r\nIn February 1873 Captain Gatacre was admitted to the Staff College.  He\r\nhad worked hard to prepare himself for the entrance examination, had\r\ntaken private lessons to rub up his mathematics, and had been abroad to\r\npolish his French; for not only had he to secure a vacancy in open\r\ncompetition, but he had to dispute the place with another officer in\r\nthe same corps.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that even in these early days Gatacre had acquired the art\r\nof making himself valued among his fellows.  Colonel Kent was dining\r\nwith the Rifle Brigade at Aldershot one evening when he had the\r\ngratification of hearing the laments of some of his contemporaries at\r\nthe Staff College at the prospect of losing Gatacre.  But the Colonel,\r\nhighly delighted at the success and popularity of his young friend,\r\nreassured them, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, I have another quite as good to send in his place.  I am\r\nsending Bengough next term.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes,\" they said, \"but we shall never have another like Gatacre; we\r\nshall miss him dreadfully.  Why, what can the 77th be made of!\"\r\n\r\n\"Gatacres and Bengoughs,\" was the proud reply.  General Kent affirms,\r\nmoreover, that {34} His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught was\r\npresent on this occasion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1873-4]\r\n\r\nDuring these two years Captain Leir[1] was Master of the Staff College\r\nDrag-hounds.  He speaks of Gatacre, who acted as his Whip, as \"the best\r\nwho ever turned them for me\"; and tells us that he was quite the most\r\naccomplished horseman of his day--that he used to ride all sorts of\r\nhorses, made and unmade, that he had wonderful patience and nerve, and\r\nwas always in the front.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Now Major-General Leir-Carleton.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Leir writes that the only fuss he ever had with his colleague\r\nwas over a hound, called Bellman, who had been given to him by the late\r\nLord Cork when master of the Queen's Buckhounds.  Bellman was a great\r\nfavourite, being very companionable, which is unusual with fox-hounds.\r\nGatacre begged leave to take him home and summer him in Shropshire, but\r\nhaving got him there the Squire took such a fancy to Bellman that his\r\nreturn was delayed till the following January.  On another occasion,\r\nhowever, the Master had every reason to be grateful to his friend, as\r\nhe tells us in the following story.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indefatigable]\r\n\r\nFor drag-hounds the scent is laid by a man who runs with aniseed half\r\nan hour before the hounds start; but as it is imperative that he should\r\nthoroughly know his line, he must walk it first, carefully selecting a\r\ntrack which avoids risk of damage to growing crops and affords suitable\r\nfences for the field.  On one occasion when {35} Captain Leir's runner\r\n(or fox as he was familiarly termed) was _hors de combat_ from a fall,\r\nhe sent for a noted runner from Reading to take his place.  But when\r\nthe Master had shown this man half the course, he suddenly threw up the\r\njob, and after that no bribe would induce him to go a yard farther.\r\nThe meet was advertised for the following day, but there was no fox,\r\nand Leir, vexed and despairing, now turned to his Whip, who was noted\r\nfor his resource in all difficulties.\r\n\r\nAt 6 a.m. the next morning Gatacre started to walk the line by the aid\r\nof a map, drove back, did his morning's work on the heath with his\r\nclass, and ran the line again in the afternoon.  The runs varied from\r\nfour to six miles, according to the season and the condition of hounds\r\nand horses, with a ten minutes' check in the middle.  The fox on this\r\noccasion, however, was a long-winded one; he ran a bit farther than his\r\ninstructions warranted, in order to enjoy the sight of half the field\r\nstruggling on the banks of a big brook.\r\n\r\nAt the final examination in December 1874 Gatacre passed out of the\r\nStaff College with special honours in military drawing and surveying,\r\nand was at once offered the post of Professor in these subjects at the\r\nRoyal Military College; he took up this appointment early in 1875.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, being then thirty-two, he was married to a\r\ncharming and beautiful girl of Irish descent.  Early in the year 1878\r\ntheir {36} eldest son, William Edward, who is now a Captain in the\r\nYorkshire Light Infantry, was born at Yorktown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1875-9]\r\n\r\nA few months later Gatacre was to know the first great grief of his\r\nlife in the loss of his mother.  Willie had always proved intensely\r\nlovable, and had also his own graceful and attentive ways of returning\r\nthe love which he received from his parents.  There was, moreover, a\r\nstrong vein of sentiment in him which led him throughout his life to\r\ncling to souvenirs and relics of the past.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: As professor]\r\n\r\nIt is evidence of the strength and the simplicity of Gatacre's\r\ncharacter that his charm of manner was felt equally by men older and\r\nyounger than himself.  \"Manners impress as they indicate real power.\r\nAnd you cannot rightly train one to an air and manner except by making\r\nhim the kind of man of whom that manner is the natural expression.\r\nNature ever puts a premium on reality.\"\r\n\r\nThe cadets in his class were fascinated by this singular and brilliant\r\npersonality, and loved him with a \"schoolboy heat.\"  One of them tells\r\nhow he seemed more one of themselves than the other professors; another\r\nremembers how he treated them as gentlemen, instead of regarding them\r\nas schoolboys; another that he was full of sympathy when anything\r\nneeded explanation; another that if he found out and fell upon some\r\nlittle meanness with the weight of his own uprightness, he would gave\r\nthe culprit from official correction {37} thus win him as a disciple;\r\nanother, writing at the time of his death, speaks of Gatacre's\r\ninfluence for good throughout his career.  Another, who has afforded me\r\nvery real assistance in this narrative, tells us that he felt such a\r\ngenuine hero-worship for Captain Gatacre that he applied for the 77th\r\nRegiment in order to serve under him.  This cadet not only passed well,\r\nbut, being a protégé of General William Napier, who was then Governor\r\nof the College, might have got himself gazetted into any regiment that\r\nhe liked to name.\r\n\r\nAfter serving four years as a military instructor, Gatacre was\r\nappointed temporarily to the post of Deputy Assistant\r\nQuarter-Master-General on the Headquarters Staff at Aldershot.  This\r\nwas his first experience of staff work.  The following winter a new\r\nfield-service equipment was engaging much attention; this was, of\r\ncourse, worked out in the office in which Gatacre was employed.  He\r\nwrites with some satisfaction of the \"mess-tin invented by me\" being\r\napproved and adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{38}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n1880-1883\r\n\r\nRANGOON\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1880]\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of his term of office at Aldershot, in May 1880,\r\nCaptain Gatacre took short leave home, and then rejoined the 77th at\r\nDover.  The regiment had been already warned for India in the next\r\ntrooping season, but the news of our misfortune at Maiwand hastened\r\ntheir departure, and in August 1880 they were hurriedly embarked at\r\nonly a fortnight's notice.  To Gatacre the hope of seeing active\r\nservice must have more than compensated for a disappointment he had\r\nexpressed at not getting another staff billet.  This hope, however,\r\nvanished on their arrival at Bombay, where the regiment learnt that the\r\ndefeat of Ayub Khan outside Khandahar on September 2 had brought the\r\ncampaign to a conclusion.  The battalion was landed at Bombay on\r\nSeptember 10, and made its way by road to Madras.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On the staff]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Gatacre's reputation as a {39} zealous and efficient\r\nofficer had preceded him, for within one month of his arrival in India\r\nhe was seconded for service on the staff of the Hyderabad Subsidiary\r\nForce, which had its headquarters at Secunderabad.  All keen soldiers\r\nare pleased to be in India, for there is more chance of active service\r\nthere than at home, and it was in the hope of getting this opportunity\r\nthat Gatacre lived and worked.  In the meantime his selection for staff\r\nwork, although the post was only \"temporary,\" was sufficiently\r\ncomplimentary to satisfy all his aspirations.  His qualities and\r\ntemperament had greater scope to expand in such a post than in the more\r\nrigid routine of a regiment; his previous experience of India added\r\ndiscernment to his enthusiasm in dealing with all the manifold\r\ninterests with which he came in contact.\r\n\r\nBut there was a cloud on the horizon which rapidly grew until the whole\r\nsky was for the moment overcast.  Early in the New Year his little son,\r\nborn at Aldershot and aged only fifteen months, fell sick with cholera,\r\nand died on January 18.  Both parents felt the blow terribly: the\r\nmother took fright for the elder boy, and decided to carry him off\r\nhome.  Several touching relics, in the way of a lock of hair, etc.,\r\nthat Gatacre, in spite of his many changes of residence, never\r\nafterwards cared to destroy, show how deeply he was moved by this loss.\r\nHe had a spontaneous fondness for children that led him all his life to\r\naccost them; and his attentions to them invariably met with that {40}\r\nquick response which is in itself a sign of grace in the recipient.\r\n\r\n  A manhood fused with female grace,\r\n    In such a sort, a child would twine\r\n    A trustful hand, unasked, in thine,\r\n  And find his comfort in thy face.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe looked forward with pleasure to getting a change when he should be\r\nrelieved in June by the officer whose post he was holding, and soon had\r\nthe satisfaction of accepting an offer from General the Honourable\r\nArthur Hardinge, Commander-in-Chief of the Bombay Army, to take the\r\nplace of his Military Secretary, who was for the moment employed\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1881]\r\n\r\nThis appointment was even more congenial than the last: for to be on\r\nthe personal staff of the Commander-in-Chief of a province meant\r\naccompanying him on all his tours of inspection.  Like the former, this\r\nappointment was an eight months' business, for staff officers in India\r\nget sixty days' short leave every year, and eight months' long leave\r\noccasionally; for the latter period it was usual to appoint some\r\nofficer to carry on, and it was Gatacre's good fortune throughout his\r\ncareer to be constantly selected for such temporary tenure of office.\r\nIn this way he gained an acquaintance with all the provinces of India,\r\nand with all arms, British and Native, such as rarely falls to the lot\r\nof one man.  When he left India, seventeen years later, there was\r\nhardly a station in all the four provinces which he had not visited.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Military Secretary]\r\n\r\nIn the course of the winter, 1881-2, General {41} Hardinge paid an\r\nofficial visit to Sir Robert Phayre, at Mhow.  One of his daughters\r\nwell remembers Major Gatacre on this occasion.  His handsome bronzed\r\nface, his slight athletic figure, and keen but kindly blue eyes\r\narrested the attention; and then on further acquaintance, his\r\nindefinable charm of manner, his courtly way of devoting himself to his\r\ncompanion for the moment, his curious mixture of modesty and power left\r\nan impression which later years exaggerated as his name became\r\nidentified with all the soldierly qualities and achievements which\r\nbuilt up his fame.\r\n\r\nEvery moment of these inspection tours was full of interest for\r\nGatacre; who, being a good son, writes fully and simply about\r\neverything to the Squire at home.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMP HAMURGHURI,\r\n\r\n_December_ 18, 1881.\r\n\r\n\"We are having a very pleasant march from Nusserabad to Neemuch; good\r\nshooting all the way--duck, snipe, and deer; also some capital\r\npig-sticking.  The wild boars here are very difficult to get out of the\r\njungle and grass, but when one does get them out across the open ground\r\nthey run like greyhounds.  I have two ponies a little under fourteen\r\nhands, both fast, and I have sometimes galloped a mile and a half\r\nbefore I could catch one; this was allowing him about a quarter of a\r\nmile start, otherwise if pressed they turn into the jungle.  When you\r\nget up to them on the open ground, they turn round and run back a pace\r\nor two, and then come straight at you, rising on their hind legs to cut\r\nyour horse if they get the chance, but {42} this of course they can't\r\ndo if you use your spear properly.  I have got some capital tushes.\r\nThe best run we have had as yet was at a place called Roopauli, two\r\nmarches back; two boars broke covert together and went away over\r\ncapital ground to another place two miles off.  The Commander-in-Chief\r\nand I took one and had a capital run after him.  I had the luck to get\r\nthe first spear.  I was pleased, because I was riding a horse of the\r\nChief's that could never be got up to a pig before.  To-morrow we are\r\ncoming to a place celebrated for cheetul, a kind of spotted deer,\r\nantlers like a stag and skin like a fallow deer.  I am in hopes of\r\ngetting one or two.  This is a beautiful country to march through, very\r\nlong grass and jungle all round; nearly all the hills are of white\r\nmarble; and spotted marbles of sorts, and an enormous number of old\r\nforts and temples beautifully ornamented with carvings in marble and\r\nstone.  Some of them are extraordinarily beautiful in form and design\r\nof carving, far superior to anything we see now--and these are\r\nthousands, not hundreds, of years old.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1882]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say when Gatacre \"found\" himself--to use an\r\nexpression that Mr. Rudyard Kipling has for ever endowed with\r\npsychological meaning; but there can be no doubt that the shifting\r\nscenes in which he played his part from the time he landed in India, in\r\nAugust 1880, till he commanded his regiment in June 1884, must have\r\nwidened his outlook on life, must have quickened his sense of the\r\nopportunities before him, and have enabled him to gauge his own powers.\r\nIndia encourages individuality to {43} a very high degree; men live in\r\nsmall groups in stations that are hundreds of miles apart; in any one\r\nplace there is (in a sense) only one man of any one grade, so that the\r\nlabourers do not jostle one another, but each has enough elbow-room to\r\nplay freely with his tools.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To Burma]\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of his time with General Hardinge in February 1882,\r\nGatacre was sent to act as Assistant Quarter-Master-General to the\r\nBurmese Division, with headquarters at Rangoon, then under the command\r\nof General H. Prendergast.  The British connection with this\r\npicturesque river-port dates from 1824, when Sir Archibald Campbell\r\ncaptured it after a feeble resistance.  In the following year, owing to\r\ncontinued outrages on British subjects and the refusal of the King of\r\nAva to enter into any treaty obligations with us, a British force\r\nadvanced up the Irrawaddy to Prome, and stayed there throughout the\r\nrainy season.  In October the Burmese Army made an organised attempt to\r\nrecover the place; but the British forces repulsed the attack, and\r\nfollowed up the enemy to within four days' march of their capital at\r\nAva.  At this point the Burmese sued for peace: their apologies were\r\naccepted, and the country was evacuated, except for the sea-board\r\nprovinces of Arakan and Tenasserim.  The Province of Pegu was restored\r\nto the Burmese and remained in their hands till 1852, when fresh\r\noutrages and insolence on the part of another Burmese sovereign again\r\ngave rise to hostilities.  At the conclusion of peace Pegu {44} was\r\nformally annexed by Proclamation, while Lord Dalhousie was Viceroy,\r\nunder the name of Lower Burma, and Rangoon was made the seat of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nUpper Burma was at that time in a deplorable condition; the excesses of\r\nthe ruler, who was called Pagan-min, are described as recalling the\r\nworst years of the later Roman Empire.  With a change of dynasty in the\r\nperson of Mindon-min, matters improved somewhat.  The new ruler\r\nrealised the value of European enterprise and capital; he allowed\r\nstrangers of all nations to settle in the country, and protected\r\ntravellers and explorers.  A few years later a commercial treaty was\r\nnegotiated with Great Britain, a Resident was received, and for his\r\nprotection he was allowed a small guard and an armoured boat on the\r\nriver.  To commemorate his flourishing reign Mindon founded a new\r\ncapital at Mandalay, and in 1874 had himself crowned there to fulfil a\r\nprophecy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: King Theebaw]\r\n\r\nOn his death, in September 1878, a terrible tragedy was enacted.\r\nMindon, being an Oriental, had many wives and many sons; these latter\r\nhe had dispersed as rulers of provinces with very good effect.  When\r\nthe old king lay dying, one of his wives devised a scheme by which to\r\nsecure the succession to Prince Theebaw, for the reason that he was her\r\nson-in-law by his marriage with Supya-lat, her daughter.  With the most\r\nfiendish designs Theebaw and the queen, in the king's name, summoned\r\nall the princes to Mandalay.  They arrived each with {45} his Oriental\r\nretinue of women of all ages.  The royal ladies were lodged in the\r\nprison, which had been cleared for their reception; the princes were\r\nreceived into the palace.  \"Under instructions from the King,\" a\r\nmassacre was perpetrated on the nights of February 15, 16, and 17,\r\n1879.  The queens and princesses and even royal children were done to\r\ndeath by the \"ruffians released for the purpose from the jail which was\r\nnow the scene of their cruelties, and their bodies were flung into a\r\nhole already dug in the jail.\"[1]  The princes were compelled to pass\r\nthrough a certain doorway in the palace, where each one was in turn cut\r\ndown; it is even said that the queen-mother and Supya-lat with their\r\nown hands did the deed.  \"Eight cartloads of the bodies of the Princes\r\nof the Blood were conveyed out of the city by the western or 'Funeral\r\nGate,' and thrown into the river according to custom.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] _Parliamentary Papers_ (Burma), 1886.  Quotations from the\r\n_Mandalay Confidential Diary_, by Mr. R. B. Shaw, Resident, of February\r\n19, 1879, and later dates.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was calculated that some eighty souls thus perished.  Even the\r\npeople were horrified.  Our Resident, Mr. Shaw, could do no more than\r\nexpress with vigour the light in which his Government would regard\r\nthese atrocities; but King Theebaw was inaccessible to argument, and\r\nreasserted his right to take \"such measures to prevent disturbance as\r\nmight be desirable,\" stating that such acts were in accordance with the\r\ncustom of the State, and that he would {46} go his own way without\r\nregard to \"censure or blame.\"[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] _Parliamentary Papers_ (Burma), 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1883]\r\n\r\nOwing to further gross outrages, the Resident was driven to fulfil his\r\nthreat of breaking off friendly relations with such a ruler; the\r\nBritish flag was hauled down in August 1879, and the Residency\r\nevacuated.\r\n\r\nThere were now no governors to keep order in the provinces: dacoits\r\nsprang up, traders were robbed and killed, the people were oppressed,\r\nand the land neglected.  English merchants, however, continued to carry\r\non their business at their own risk; their boats plied up and down the\r\nbroad stream, and it was in their hospitable company that Gatacre spent\r\nChristmas 1882 at Mandalay.\r\n\r\n\r\nRANGOON, _January_ 11, 1883.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR FATHER,\r\n\r\n\"I send you a line to tell you my doings up-country at Christmas time.\r\nI was sorry to leave Alice just then, but the opportunity of seeing\r\nMandalay for nothing was a great temptation.\r\n\r\n\"We went, a party of six, including myself, most of them merchants.  We\r\nhad a steamer to ourselves, and the head of the Irrawaddy Flotilla\r\nCompany, a Mr. Swan, who took us, did everything in first-rate style.\r\nThe River Irrawaddy is a very difficult one to navigate at this dry\r\nseason of the year, owing to the constantly shifting sands.  We did not\r\nget aground, luckily, but we passed several steamers fast on the sands;\r\nthey sometimes remain there six months till the river fills and floats\r\nthem off.  The steamers only drew 4 ft. 6 in. of water.\r\n\r\n{47}\r\n\r\n\"We took four and a half days altogether to go up to Mandalay, but I\r\ndid not join them till the steamer reached Prome, so I had only three\r\ndays on board going up.  The country, as far as we could see from the\r\nbanks, consists of large rich plains, covered with grass and scrub\r\njungle; very little cultivation, owing to the poverty of the people,\r\nbut if capital was forthcoming the soil would grow anything.  Where the\r\ncrops were sown the yield was very large.  There are low ranges of\r\nhills on the right bank, and a highish range, called the Shan\r\nMountains, on the left bank.\r\n\r\n\"We were told there was but little game inland; we saw plenty of\r\nwild-fowl, geese, etc.  The poverty of the people is chiefly owing to\r\nthe King having started lotteries, which bring him in 10,000 Rs., about\r\n£800, a day.  The people have gone gambling mad, and barter everything\r\nthey have for tickets--property, children, everything.  The King ruins\r\nthe country by his recklessness in squandering money; he presses the\r\npeople to such an extent that an up-country Burman will hardly take the\r\ntrouble to make money.\r\n\r\n\"Mandalay is nothing but a collection of mud huts and a few masonry\r\nbuildings, laid out in a beautiful style, all the houses in rows, with\r\nlarge streets running between each at right angles.  It was laid out by\r\nItalians.  None of the roads are made, so the bullock-carts passing\r\nalong them in the rains have cut them up to a frightful extent; and in\r\nthe rains they are impassable except quite at the edges, and then only\r\nto pedestrians.  Mandalay was only built twenty-five years ago;\r\nformerly the capital was Ameerapoora, about six miles off, but was\r\nchanged to Mandalay by order of the King.  {48} Ameerapoora is a\r\nbeautiful site--large trees, grass, and water everywhere.  Some of the\r\ncarved pagodas are very beautiful, but going very much to decay.  The\r\ncustom is, in Burma, that when a man builds a house or pagoda he only\r\ncan repair it, or his relations; the consequence is that in course of\r\ntime the building is forgotten and goes to pieces.\r\n\r\n\"We saw the war-boats on the river; they are long dug-out canoes, a\r\nbeautiful shape somewhat like this,[3] generally with a figure-head of\r\na peacock (their sacred bird).  The canoes are gilt all over, and\r\nmanned with eighty to one hundred men; each has a short paddle, and is\r\narmed with a 'dah,' the Burmese knife, a 2 ft. 6 in. blade, with handle\r\nof 8 in. or 12 in.  The canoes go like lightning, driven by the rowers,\r\nwho shout all the time.  The Burmese are great boatmen, and their races\r\non the water are well worth seeing.  They bet tremendously high on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] See drawing in letter.  [Transcriber's note: this letter was\r\nmissing from the source book.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The second largest bell in the world is at Mendoon, near Mandalay;\r\nthis we went to see.  It is 14 ft. high, and of a most enormous\r\nthickness--about 1 ft. 6 in. I should say.  It was originally suspended\r\non three enormous teak trees laid on masonry supports, but these have\r\ngiven way, and now it rests in the ground.  There is also near the bell\r\nthe commencement of a very large pagoda.  Some one (I forget who) made\r\nup his mind to build the largest pagoda in the world, so started upon\r\none.  He got together an extraordinary amount of brick-work, but an\r\nearthquake unfortunately stopped the work by splitting it up in several\r\nplaces.  It is about 100 yards square and high, so you can imagine the\r\nsize of it.  It is built with {49} large red bricks, 2 ft. long by 1\r\nft. wide by 4 in. thick.\r\n\r\n\"We stopped in Mandalay two and a half days.  I rode about all over the\r\nplace, and found the people very civil, though they are very suspicious\r\nof Englishmen.\r\n\r\n\"We came down in one and a half days to Prome, where I caught the night\r\ntrain down, as I had to be back on New Year's Day, my leave being up.\r\nThe trip was a most enjoyable one.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Second-in-command]\r\n\r\nThe temporary staff billet having run out at the end of 1882, Gatacre\r\nwent home on three months' leave early in the following year, and when\r\nhe returned in May took up the post of second-in-command of his\r\nregiment, which in those days meant taking command of one wing of the\r\nbattalion.  This brought no change of residence, as the 77th were then\r\nquartered in Rangoon.\r\n\r\nHe joined heartily in everything that was going on, and had, moreover,\r\ninterests of his own which lay beyond the field of duty.  The spring\r\nand autumn race-meetings were a great event.  Though he does not seem\r\nto have owned any racing ponies, he was always in request as a jockey.\r\nEvery morning he would hack down to the racecourse, and being a light\r\nweight was often asked to give a gallop to the ponies that were in\r\ntraining.  In a letter of June 1883 he says: \"I rode in five races, and\r\nwon two, the hurdle race and an open race--the best race of the\r\nmeeting--which pleased me.\"\r\n\r\n{50}\r\n\r\nThere was a steeplechase pony named Free Lance that he rode to victory\r\nmany times.  The owner of Free Lance appeared as Mr. Darwood, a\r\ngentleman of Rangoon, of mixed nationality; but I am inclined to think\r\nthat Free Lance was in reality the property of King Theebaw, for the\r\nGeneral told me that at one time he had half shares with King Theebaw\r\nin a racing pony, which he rode, and there is no other period to which\r\nthis incident could be attached.  I have now in my possession a gold\r\nscarf-pin that King Theebaw sent as a recognition of Gatacre's services\r\nin the matter of this pony.  Although this secret was kept so close\r\nthat none of the regimental officers got wind of it, it is not\r\nconsidered improbable.[4]  It was well known that Gatacre had friends\r\namongst the leading men of Rangoon, and it is entirely in accordance\r\nwith his character that he should have been personally acquainted with\r\nhis native neighbours.  Indeed it is not altogether impossible that he\r\nwas engaged in some sort of secret intelligence duties for Government,\r\nfor he told me that at one time he used to disguise himself and go and\r\ntalk in the Native Bazaar, and it is certain that he acquired the\r\nBurmese language, and could even write it to some extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] As King Theebaw was at that time an independent friendly sovereign,\r\nthere is nothing contrary to any regulations in Gatacre's association\r\nwith him in this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Iolanthe]\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1882 the regimental officers and others in the station\r\ngot up a performance of _Patience_, in which Gatacre {51} figured as\r\none of the Dragoon Chorus.  In the following year _Iolanthe_ was\r\nproduced.  Gatacre was anxious that the audience should include persons\r\nof all nationalities; and in order that those who could not understand\r\nthe English words should have some key to the action, he made a précis\r\nof the play, and, having written it in Hindustani characters, had it\r\nlithographed, and distributed with the programmes.  A copy of this\r\ncurious document, which covers three sides of foolscap, and is signed\r\nin full, is still to be seen in the scrap-book of the officer who\r\njoined the 77th Regiment for love of his tutor at Sandhurst.\r\n\r\nAt the end of September Gatacre heard of the birth of his third son,\r\nJohn Kirwan, now in the 11th Bengal Lancers.\r\n\r\nIn December 1883 the regiment left Rangoon for Secunderabad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{52}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n1884-1885\r\n\r\nSECUNDERABAD\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1884]\r\n\r\nI have read in a recent biography of Alexander Hamilton that \"the power\r\nof his intellect was hardly suspected under the ambush of his\r\nextraordinary charm.\"[1]  This was equally true of Gatacre.  Moreover,\r\nthe high standard of his physical endowments was in itself a mask to\r\nhis mental abilities; in reality, his physical force was but the\r\nevidence and the result of his intellectual energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Alexander Hamilton, by F. S. Oliver, p. 149.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Camp of exercise]\r\n\r\nHe turned the whole of his power on to the work in hand; even when\r\npartly disabled, he would not allow himself to be cheated of the\r\npleasure and opportunity that his work afforded.  Of course the\r\nopportunity that his soul yearned for was active service; he was daily\r\ndiscovering his own value, and longed to prove himself in the fierce\r\nfurnace of war.\r\n\r\nThe year 1884 opened with the nearest approach to these conditions that\r\ncan be contrived without an enemy.  A camp of exercise on a very large\r\nscale was held near Bangalore, {53} at which 10,000 troops were\r\nassembled.  Sir Charles Keyes commanded the First Division, in which\r\nthe 77th were included, and General H. Prendergast had command of the\r\nSecond Division, with Colonel W. F. Gatacre as\r\nAssistant-Quarter-Master-General.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the misfortune recorded in Gatacre's own letter given\r\nbelow, he more than satisfied his General, who writes on June 11, 1909:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I found him a remarkably clever, zealous, and efficient officer.\r\nDuring the operations his horse fell, and injured his ankle so that he\r\ncould neither ride nor walk, but that did not prevent him from thinking\r\nout and arranging all our plans; though disabled and in great pain, he\r\nwould write till two in the morning, and all went well with the\r\nDivision, which he accompanied carried on a stretcher, owing to his\r\ndevotion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow is Gatacre's own account of it all:\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS 2ND DIVISION,\r\n  CAMP KRISTNARAJAHPUR,\r\n\r\n_January_ 27, 1884.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR FATHER,\r\n\r\n\"I send you a short letter by this mail, but will write at length by\r\nnext one, and tell you all about the manoeuvres.  They are over now and\r\nhave been most successful.  I have enjoyed them thoroughly, though I\r\nhave been most unfortunate.  I told you one of my horses or charger\r\nponies died of anthrax a few days before leaving Burma (I had just sold\r\nthe brute for 600 rupees); and the other charger, which I had had for\r\ntwo years, and who {54} was a first-rate animal, died of colic the day\r\nafter I arrived here.  Fortunately for me a friend of mine was kicked\r\noff his horse a few days after coming here, and hurt a good deal, so he\r\nasked me to ride him, which I have done all through the fortnight's\r\nwork.  Though a very fine horse, he, like many walers, was very nervous\r\nand shy, and the last day of the manoeuvring he got nervous in jumping\r\na nullah, and instead of jumping it he jumped into it, and rolled over\r\nme, giving me a regular flattening out; he has damaged my ankle and\r\nboth my knees slightly, and I think it will be at least a month before\r\nI can do anything at all, though I am perfectly well in every way.  The\r\ndoctor says that the small bones of the foot are crushed, but that in a\r\nmonth I shall be all right.  It was very annoying, just at the finish,\r\nwasn't it?  Sir Frederick Roberts came to see me, and said he was very\r\nsorry about it; so did General Hardinge, the C.-in-C. in Bombay; he\r\ncame and had a long talk in my tent, and told me all about John and his\r\nregiment.  He thinks a great deal of John, and says his regiment is one\r\nof his best.  Your luminous match-box has furnished lights for all\r\nthese big people; it is always on my table; I shall scratch their names\r\non the back of it.  I wanted to see Sir Frederick Roberts about the\r\ncommand of the regiment; so I asked to see him in the usual way, and he\r\nsent word to say he would be glad to see me; so I got a litter and went\r\nacross.  He was most kind, said he knew all about it, that he would\r\ngive his support, and that I need have no doubts on the matter.  He\r\nasked me if I would like a staff appointment; I said I would, but that\r\nI wanted to command the regiment.\r\n\r\n\"At present the camp has all broken up; {55} my regiment goes\r\nto-morrow, and I go with it.  I have not seen my own regiment since I\r\ncame here scarcely; as they were in the 1st Division and I was A.Q.M.G.\r\nof the 2nd Division.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In command]\r\n\r\nOn June 24, 1884, Gatacre realised his immediate desire, and succeeded\r\nto the command of the 2nd Battalion Middlesex Regiment, as the old 77th\r\nhad been renamed.\r\n\r\nAlthough nothing occurred during his period of command to distinguish\r\nhim from many another equally efficient officer, still a recapitulation\r\nof the qualities which remain in the minds of those who served under\r\nhim will give us some idea of what he then was.  I am mainly indebted\r\nfor the material for the following sketch of Gatacre as a Commanding\r\nOfficer to the kindness of Colonel N. W. Barnardiston, M.V.O., who\r\nwrites in July 1909:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was adjutant at the time, and never before or since have I served\r\nunder a better or more efficient battalion commander, nor have I come\r\nacross one during my experience on the staff.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGatacre was forty years old when he succeeded Colonel Colquhoun; he had\r\nserved very little with the regiment, but the time spent on the staff\r\nhad added to his professional value.  While his acute perceptions and\r\neasy receptiveness had ripened his judgment on many points, his\r\nsimplicity of character and natural integrity remained unimpaired.  He\r\nhad downright notions about right and wrong, but was influenced more by\r\nthe spirit than by the letter of the {56} bond: he was very just, but\r\nnever hard, always showing a lofty sympathy for those in trouble of any\r\nsort, and a tender consideration for their feelings.  There was about\r\nhim a curious balance of moral austerity and physical\r\ntenderheartedness; these apparently contradictory qualities both came\r\ninto fuller play when in the field.  He taught the regiment to work\r\nwith the disinterested spirit that animated himself; to work for the\r\nwork's sake: he insisted on every duty being done correctly and\r\nconscientiously and strictly according to regulations.  He never shrank\r\nfrom the disagreeable duty of rebuke, where the interests of the\r\nservice were at stake; but at the same time he never unduly worried his\r\nsubordinates, or interfered with their province, and in no way passed\r\nthe frontier of his own department.  If he wanted more work, he looked\r\nbeyond and not below his own sphere of influence.\r\n\r\nEven at this time Gatacre's willingness to accept responsibility and to\r\nundertake troublesome and unexpected tasks was remarkable.  Where some\r\nmen might raise objections and fear obstructions when asked, or even\r\nordered, to get something done that was new or out of the common, he\r\nwould welcome the call on his resources, and do his utmost, by\r\nenlisting the goodwill and co-operation of those about him, to carry\r\nthe business through.  Later on, one of his colleagues in Poona looked\r\nupon his trick of saying, \"No difficulty about that,\" as evidence of a\r\nvery valuable quality; and in {57} the Office in Bombay there was a\r\njoke that the word \"impossible\" was not allowed.\r\n\r\nIt was a sign of the lack of vanity in his composition that Gatacre\r\ntook so long to find out that there was anything exceptional about\r\nhimself, but it is now admitted on all sides that his capacity for work\r\nwas far in excess of the average.  According to Mr. G. W. Steevens in\r\n1898, \"his body was all steel wire.\"  He was certainly lean and light;\r\nat sixty he discovered to his great satisfaction that his weight was\r\nthe same, ten stone two, as it had been as a subaltern in Peshawur.  In\r\nappearance also he changed very little, looking always about ten years\r\nyounger than his age.  His back was short in proportion to the length\r\nof his limbs, which gave the impression of a shorter man than he\r\nmeasured, but at the same time this was the secret of his graceful seat\r\non a horse, and of his extraordinary walking powers.  Like the good\r\nhorses that he loved to bestride, Gatacre was fast and free, and had\r\nthe staying powers of the thorough-bred animal; it was inevitable that\r\nsuch a one should be sometimes difficult to \"follow,\" and that other\r\nmen should occasionally feel that he called upon them for exertions\r\nthat were beyond their powers.\r\n\r\nHis whole heart was in his profession; and with the material that was\r\nnow under his hand he developed an aptitude for the practical training\r\nof both officers and men.  Acting on ideas suggested by the recent camp\r\nat Bangalore, {58} he initiated small field-days at Secunderabad, in\r\nwhich one major with one half-battalion was pitted against another with\r\nthe remainder.  This was before the days of staff-rides and annual\r\ncamps of exercise, and was so much of a novelty that his adjutant\r\nwrites that many of his officers \"learnt more of the art of organising\r\nmanoeuvres, drawing up schemes, and issuing orders than it was then\r\npossible to do at the Staff College.\"  Moreover, to accompany Gatacre\r\non a field-day was a lesson in horsemanship.  He had two capital Arab\r\nponies, and would often lend the spare one to his adjutant or galloper.\r\nNo obstacle stopped him, though sometimes these clever little animals\r\nwere expected to move over the most impossible-looking country--craggy\r\nhills, big rocks and boulders, and the steep sides of deep nullahs.  If\r\nreally pounded, he would slip off and lead or drive his pony, until at\r\nthe earliest moment he would be on its back again.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1885]\r\n\r\nHis gift for administration was further exercised in perfecting the\r\nregulations for the rapid turn-out of the Movable Column which had its\r\nbase at Secunderabad: every little detail was most carefully thought\r\nout on the lines of a far larger mobilisation, and every man knew\r\nexactly where he had to go, and what he had to do, whenever he should\r\nhear the \"Alarm.\"\r\n\r\nIf he was impatient of laziness or shirking, he was, on the other hand,\r\ngenerous in his appreciation of honest work.  He made it a practice to\r\nhelp good men to get forward.  There were at that time in India a large\r\nnumber of {59} extra-regimental appointments open to non-commissioned\r\nofficers.  The natural training-ground for such aspirants was in the\r\norderly room, but few commanding officers cared to part with a man who\r\nhad just become really competent in his particular job and valuable to\r\nthemselves; with the result that the more promising and ambitious young\r\nfellows were unwilling to serve.  But during Gatacre's reign the plan\r\nwas reversed: if a good man, no matter what his duties were, or how\r\ndifficult he would be to replace, applied for a suitable and desirable\r\nposition outside the regiment, Gatacre would heartily support the\r\napplication.  Very soon there were plenty of keen young soldiers eager\r\nto qualify for billets which were the sure road to advancement.  When\r\nas a General Officer he had the opportunity of pushing forward\r\npromising young officers, he acted on the same principle; he was always\r\nready to train, but never hesitated to let others reap the harvest that\r\nhe had sown.\r\n\r\nThus in a hundred ways the Colonel built up a reputation for kindness,\r\nefficiency, originality, and power: and we are not surprised to read\r\nthat \"his period of command was a very happy one for the 77th.\"\r\n\r\nIn April 1885 the far-reaching consequences of the Russian scare made\r\nthemselves felt at Secunderabad, where the following telegram was\r\nreceived:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Warn for service the 2nd Middlesex Regiment and 24th Madras Native\r\nInfantry.  Detail hereafter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n{60}\r\n\r\nThe excitement was intense.  No officer was allowed to leave his\r\nbungalow for a walk without saying in which direction he was going.  To\r\nGatacre the idea of leading his regiment into action must have\r\npresented visions of endless opportunities, and those who knew him must\r\nalways regret that he had no chance to display as a regimental officer\r\nthat personal valour and forwardness under fire for which, as a General\r\nOfficer, he has been subjected to so much criticism.\r\n\r\nThis state of expectant commotion lasted for six weeks, and then all\r\nhopes were quenched, for on May 26 official intimation reached the\r\nCommanding Officer that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"War with Russia having been averted, the regiment need no longer hold\r\nitself in readiness for active service.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the second time that he had had to bury his disappointment,\r\nand again a third time was it to happen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: D.Q.M.G.]\r\n\r\nIt was clear to all that before long there would be another Burmese\r\nWar.  The grievances of Europeans against King Theebaw had gone on\r\naccumulating: diplomatic efforts had entirely failed to secure\r\nattention or redress, the patience of the Foreign Office was at an end,\r\nand the Government of India was directed to prepare an expeditionary\r\nforce to march on Mandalay, and thereby to teach King Theebaw that he\r\ncould not afford to flout the British Government.  This {61} mission\r\nwas entrusted to General Prendergast.  Gatacre volunteered to come down\r\nand help his former Chief in the embarkation of the troops at Madras\r\nfor Rangoon.  Having proved his value as a staff officer, and having\r\nheard of his previous journey to Mandalay, Prendergast was most anxious\r\nto take Gatacre with him; but all the posts had been filled, and to the\r\nGeneral's \"grievous disappointment and much to the disadvantage of the\r\nGovernment,\" the application to take him as Military Secretary or\r\nSpecial Transport Officer was refused, and Gatacre had to be content\r\nwith the thanks of the Government of India for his services in the\r\nembarkation of troops which he was not permitted to accompany.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] _Proceedings of Government_, No. 6502, November 17, 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Secunderabad]\r\n\r\nIn a later chapter we shall follow the fortunes of the Expedition, but\r\nfor the moment all thought of Burma was swept out of Gatacre's mind by\r\nthe prospect of serving on the Headquarters Staff of the army.  On\r\nNovember 24, 1885, the following telegrams were exchanged:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If agreeable to you, Sir Frederick proposes to recommend you to\r\nGovernment as Deputy Quarter-Master-General; you will have to join at\r\nonce if Government approve.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTo which this reply was sent:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I gratefully accept His Excellency's offer; am ready to go anywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn December 11 the following Farewell Order was issued:\r\n\r\n\r\n{62}\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant-Colonel Gatacre wishes the Battalion farewell.\r\n\r\n\"He thanks the officers, non-commissioned officers, and men for the way\r\nin which they have zealously and loyally carried out his orders during\r\nthe short eighteen months he has had the honour of commanding them, and\r\nwill always take the deepest interest in their welfare.\r\n\r\n\"He especially thanks his regimental staff, viz. Lieutenant and\r\nAdjutant N. W. Barnardiston, and Captain and Quarter-Master Hunt, for\r\ntheir good service as Adjutant and Quarter-Master respectively, and\r\nLieutenant Savile and Lieutenant Burton, who have on many occasions\r\nofficiated in their capacities.\r\n\r\n\"He wishes the 2nd Battalion Middlesex Regiment many happy New Years,\r\nand success wherever they go.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{63}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n1885-1889\r\n\r\nBLACK MOUNTAIN EXPEDITION\r\n\r\nSir Frederick Roberts succeeded Sir Donald Stewart as\r\nCommander-in-Chief in India in 1885.  After short leave home the new\r\nChief returned just in time to preside over a great concentration of\r\ntroops near Delhi in December of that year.  It was the biggest thing\r\nof the sort that had yet been attempted; the manoeuvres occupied about\r\nthree weeks, and concluded on January 8, 1886, with a Grand Review in\r\nwhich about 35,000 men took part.  It would have been a splendid sight,\r\nhad it not been spoilt by a deluge of rain.  The Viceroy, Lord\r\nDufferin, was on parade, and it was afterwards suggested that it was\r\nthe firing of his salute that had brought down the rain.  Anyhow, just\r\nas his flag was run up, the storm burst and the rain pitilessly poured\r\ndown on the columns of men as they carried out the unaltered programme\r\nof the day.  The march-past occupied six hours.  According to an\r\neye-witness, the \"trot-past of cavalry and artillery in spite of\r\neverything was magnificent, and could have been performed {64} by no\r\nother troops....  The Viceroy sat on his horse through the rain with\r\nexemplary patience, and we only hope that he will be none the worse.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Chapman[1] had just taken up the post of\r\nQuarter-Master-General, and first saw his Deputy at this camp.  Gatacre\r\nseems from the outset to have made a good impression on his Chief, who\r\ndescribes him in a letter from Delhi as \"a man of active intelligence,\r\nquick and ready to do anything, a good rider, and a popular man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Now General Sir Edward Chapman, K.C.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: At Headquarters]\r\n\r\nIt is the province of the Deputy to take charge of the office in which\r\nhe is working--that is, to acquaint himself with all that is going on\r\nin the department and to know all the staff and the clerks personally.\r\nOn his arrival at Headquarters Gatacre rapidly gathered up all the\r\nthreads of his new work, and made himself more and more valuable to his\r\nChief; while from his own point of view he used to say that it was at\r\nthis time that he learnt how to put a finish to his work in the office,\r\nand to appreciate the scope and importance to the army at large of the\r\nindividual work done at Headquarters.  As is often the case after a\r\ncampaign, there was much important reorganisation worked out during the\r\nnext few years; new schemes of training, housing and surveying, were\r\ninitiated and carried out.  From the inside of the\r\nQuarter-Master-General's office Gatacre could in a short time get a\r\ncomprehension of many points of {65} army administration such as a\r\nlifetime in the field would fail to give.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1886]\r\n\r\nDuring the winter months the Commander-in-Chief goes on tour,\r\naccompanied by a few staff officers: sometimes the\r\nQuarter-Master-General would go himself and leave Gatacre in charge,\r\nsometimes it was the other way round.  One year when the Q.M.G. was\r\nmaking an extended tour, Mrs. Chapman was much pleased at getting a\r\nvisit from Colonel Gatacre every morning as he went down to office.  In\r\nresponse to her appreciation of these attentions he averred that he\r\nlooked upon her as part of the office, and must see that all was well.\r\n\r\nThe two men were associated in this department for more than three\r\nyears, and by the time that General Chapman had to resign (owing to bad\r\nhealth) a fast friendship had sprung up between them, one from which\r\n\"the all-assuming months and years\" have taken no part.  On hearing of\r\nhis friend's death in 1906 General Chapman wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A more loyally devoted assistant I could not have found, active,\r\nuntiring, and self-sacrificing; the public service and the interests of\r\nothers were always before him.  His gallantry and forwardness on\r\nservice were acknowledged by all, but it was late in life that he so\r\ndistinguished himself.  I recall chiefly the straight-forwardness and\r\nhonesty of his help and advice, and remember his never-failing and\r\ncheery support whenever we had a difficulty to face.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOwing to the illness of the Quarter-Master-General, {66} Gatacre\r\naccompanied the Commander-in-Chief on two long tours in the spring of\r\n1886.  On the first he saw many places of great historical interest,\r\nsuch as Cawnpore, Futtehghur, Lucknow; and in the second he was taken\r\nto Peshawur and Lundi Kotal, where many interesting problems of\r\nfrontier defence were discussed on the ground.  For two months in 1886\r\nhe officiated as Quarter-Master-General, pending the arrival of Sir\r\nWilliam Lockhart, who was to act for General Chapman while away on long\r\nleave.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1887]\r\n\r\nChristmas was spent at Calcutta, and early in 1887 Gatacre was again on\r\nthe move.  During this year he was twice entrusted with an independent\r\nmission; in March he accompanied the Chief on his official visit to\r\nPeshawur, Kohat, Rawulpindi, and Quetta, and was afterwards sent to\r\nsurvey and report upon the proposed line for a military road from\r\nLoralai in Beluchistan to Dera Ghazi Khan on the Indus.  His abstract\r\nof daily work shows that he was out all day exploring and surveying.\r\nHis report shows that he thoroughly investigated all questions relating\r\nto the water supply and the area of the camping-grounds on the road,\r\nand deals with many questions as to the safety and comfort of the\r\nworking parties and their guards.  Although the country to be explored\r\ncovered 183 miles, he worked with such celerity that the work was\r\ncompleted in thirteen days.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On tour]\r\n\r\nWriting from Bannu a week or two later he finds time to send a\r\ncomprehensive account of his doings:\r\n\r\n{67}\r\n\r\n\"I think I wrote you last from Loralai, beyond Quetta to the east:\r\nwell, from there I explored a new road which is to run through Mekhtar,\r\nKingri, Rukni, to Dera Ghazi Khan on the Indus.  It has been approved,\r\nand is to be carried out at once; as in the event of troops moving up\r\ntowards Kandahar, it would be the route along which all our regiments\r\nand stores from the Punjab would move.  The country is a wild one at\r\npresent, savage, with no cultivation or inhabitants, except a few\r\nrobbers: but the lie of the road is good, and the gradients are easy.\r\nOf course a made road will draw the large Kafilas of camels with\r\nmerchandise from one end to the other, and as the roads will be under\r\nour protection the native merchants will gladly use it, and this will\r\ngradually people the various halting-places, and so settle the country\r\nby degrees.  There was much game along the route; markhor, a large goat\r\nwith splendid horns; gud, a large sheep with very large curly horns,\r\nwolves and small game, hares, partridges, wood-pigeons, etc.  I had\r\nvery little time for shooting, but shot one markhor and much small game\r\nhere and there as I came across it; but as I had a lot of surveying to\r\ndo all day, I had no time to make excursions after game alone, though I\r\nshould much have liked to have had a turn with Stephen in some of the\r\nhills through which I passed.  You would have been delighted with the\r\ncountry in some places, something like Scotland with fewer trees and\r\nmore sun, but comparatively cool for India.  The only disagreeable\r\nthing about it is the general want of water and the number of poisonous\r\nsnakes.  Water is found only in certain streams and in single springs,\r\nand is very valuable.  Of course, any good road which is {68} required\r\nhas to follow the line of water, but the rivers commence to flow at any\r\npoint in the river-bed, and after becoming a rushing torrent, disappear\r\nas suddenly as they arose, into the ground and are seen no more; where\r\nthey go to no one knows, but you may seek in vain further down the bed\r\nof the river and not find water.  In some cases the water reappears in\r\nthe stream ten miles lower down, and disappears again as before.  The\r\nsnakes are everywhere, and it was a few days before I left Khur that a\r\nyoung engineer named Hackman was bitten.  I saw his death in\r\nyesterday's paper.  I killed several cobras while marching, I am glad\r\nto say.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn November of the same year he was sent on a similar mission to\r\nSikkim.  It was discovered that a private treaty had been signed by\r\nwhich the Rajah had declared that Sikkim was subject only to China and\r\nTibet, thus repudiating the British suzerainty.  By way of preparation\r\nfor an expedition to settle this question Gatacre was sent up to report\r\nupon the road over the Jelap-La along which troops would move on to\r\nLingtu, the capital of Sikkim.  Though it was at that time held by a\r\nhostile force of Tibetans, he approached near enough to sketch the fort\r\nat Lingtu.  His report and his sketches were afterwards incorporated\r\nwith other matter in a blue-book dealing with the affairs of Sikkim.\r\nSir Thomas Graham asserts that the information set down was of great\r\nvalue to him when in the following spring he led a force into Lingtu\r\nand brought the incident to a satisfactory conclusion.\r\n\r\n{69}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: At Simla]\r\n\r\nIn a letter to his father from Simla of September 1887 Gatacre relates\r\nthe following story:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Did I tell you I was nearly polished off by a madman with a revolver?\r\nHe shot two men he came across, then got on to a rock and defied the\r\ncrowd, but I got a stick and went for him, to prevent his doing more\r\nmischief.  He warned me not to come near him, but I spoke to him in his\r\nown language, and never took my eyes off him, and when he was going to\r\nhave a shot at me he suddenly changed his mind and blew a hole in his\r\nbreast about three or four inches in diameter.  The fact was he was not\r\nquite sure whether he had a spare round for himself, and these\r\nfanatical fellows always destroy themselves after doing as much\r\nmischief as they are able; when he shot himself I was just within reach\r\nof him, but too late to knock the pistol out of his hands.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis incident attracted a good deal of attention at the time, as the\r\nmurderer was the personal servant of a resident member of the United\r\nService Club.  He had begun by shooting at another servant, and\r\ninflicted a mortal wound; the next shot struck the chowkidar, or\r\ncaretaker, in the arm.  Gatacre then appeared on the scene and played\r\nthe part he describes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another story told of him that belongs to this same year.\r\n\r\nOn September 27 Lady Dufferin gave a ball at Government House; all the\r\nworld was there and Gatacre among them.  As was his invariable habit,\r\nhe stayed to the end, and early in the {70} morning told a friend that\r\nhe was just starting for a ride to Umballa, but would be back in office\r\nthe next day.  To accomplish this design he had arranged for ponies to\r\nbe in readiness at the various stages along the Old Road from Simla to\r\nUmballa, which is a distance of ninety-seven miles, descending about\r\n6,000 ft. from the mountains to the plains.  As far as Kalka they were\r\nhired ponies, from there to Umballa he had borrowed mounts from a\r\nfriend, using nine ponies each way.  Leaving Simla at 5.15 a.m., he\r\nreached Umballa at 2.30 that afternoon.  At 4 o'clock he started back\r\nand dismounted at Simla again at 3.5 a.m.  That is to say, after\r\ndancing till daybreak, he covered little short of two hundred miles in\r\ntwenty-two hours, and turned up again at 10 o'clock ready and fit for\r\nhis office work as usual.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to seek for any pretext for such exertion; the fun of\r\nthe rapid ride, the desire to excel, were quite sufficient stimulus for\r\nhim.  He told the newspapers at the time that he wanted to show what\r\noffice men could do.\r\n\r\nBut before very long he was to have an opportunity of putting these\r\npowers to more practical uses.  In September 1888 Gatacre and two of\r\nhis colleagues on the Headquarter Staff were given posts on the Hazara\r\nField Force, then concentrating near Abbottabad.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hazara border]\r\n\r\nAfter the Mutiny the Hazara and Peshawur borders became \"a\r\nrallying-point for mutinous Sepoys and traitors in arms who had to flee\r\nfrom British justice.\"  There was in particular {71} a sect known as\r\nthe Sittana Fanatics, who continued to stir up coalitions against our\r\npower, as they had previously done against our Sikh predecessors in the\r\nPunjab.  An expedition under Sir Sydney Cotton in 1858 advanced into\r\nthe mountains, drove the Hindustani fanatics from Sittana, destroyed\r\ntheir forts, razed their dwellings to the ground, and extorted an\r\nundertaking from the neighbouring tribes that the rebels should not be\r\nallowed a passage through their territory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1888]\r\n\r\nAlthough the centre of disturbance was thus forced back at the point of\r\nthe sword to Malka, it was not long before numerous raids on unarmed\r\ntraders, and other outrages, brought the peace of the frontier again\r\ninto question.  Our allies were either unable or unwilling to carry out\r\ntheir pledges, and in 1863 Sir Neville Chamberlain led a force through\r\nthe Ambeyla Defile.  This expedition differed from the others in that\r\nall the contiguous tribes were in a state of disaffection, and on this\r\naccount there was more fighting than in the previous punitive\r\nexpeditions.  The story of the repeated capture and loss of the Eagle's\r\nNest and Crag Picquet still makes brave reading, and afforded moreover\r\nmost satisfactory proof of the loyalty of our reorganised Native Army.\r\nIt was noted with satisfaction in 1888 that very few of the Hindustani\r\nfanatics were to be found in the ranks of the enemy, showing that the\r\nlesson of 1863 was more lasting in its effect than the others had been.\r\nThe policy of the Government {72} had never altered; in every case the\r\ntribe was informed--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That the British Government did not covet their possessions, nor those\r\nof other neighbouring tribes, with whom it desired to be at peace; but\r\nthat it expected tribes would restrain individual members from\r\ncommitting unprovoked outrages on British subjects, and afford redress\r\nwhen they are committed; that when a whole tribe, instead of affording\r\nredress, seeks to screen the individual offenders, the British\r\nGovernment has no alternative but to hold the whole tribe\r\nresponsible.\"[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] _A Record of the Expeditions against the North-West Frontier\r\nTribes_, by Paget and Mason (1884), p. 41.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe enforcing of this principle has led to the numerous little wars\r\nthat have afforded the opportunities for distinction to all ranks of\r\nwhich the personnel of an army is so quick to avail itself.  Each\r\nexpedition has usually been of a few weeks' duration only; sometimes\r\nthere was very little actual fighting; sometimes there was very little\r\npolitical gain; but always there has been a story of hardship and\r\nvalour.\r\n\r\nThe Hazara Field Force of 1888 was mobilised for the punishment of\r\ncertain tribes inhabiting the slopes of the Black Mountain, a region\r\nlying on the left bank of the Indus, north of Abbottabad.  It was some\r\nyears since we had had a reckoning with Hassanzais and Akazais in\r\nparticular, and they had been showing increased insolence in their\r\nattitude and daring in their raids.\r\n\r\n{73}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battye killed]\r\n\r\nA sufficient occasion was all that was needed to bring about open\r\nhostility, and this was afforded by the tribesmen themselves on June\r\n18, 1888.  On that day Colonel Battye and Captain Urmston conducted a\r\nroute-march with some three score Goorkhas from the frontier post at\r\nOghi; they had gone perhaps a little nearer to the frontier than was\r\nquite expedient, but it was afterwards shown that they had never\r\nactually left British territory.  When about ten miles from Oghi, they\r\nwere fired at from two points simultaneously.  Colonel Battye ordered\r\nthe Goorkhas to rush a ridge just ahead on which they could make a\r\nstand.  The ridge was secured, but, unfortunately, the two British\r\nofficers turned back to help a wounded man, and, while they were thus\r\nseparated from the troops, both were cut down with swords.  The Subadar\r\n(native officer) at once took command, though one arm had been disabled\r\nby a blow from a stone, and a bullet had gone through his thigh, and\r\nhis head was streaming with blood.  He collected the party, and marched\r\nback to the spot where the two officers had fallen.  Keeping up a\r\nspirited fire to drive back the tribesmen, he succeeded in recovering\r\nboth bodies, and brought the whole party back into camp at 8.30 that\r\nnight.  This man, Subadar Kishnbir Nagar Koti, had already gained the\r\nOrder of Merit three times in the Kabul Campaign.[3]\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] See _Civil and Military Gazette_, June 1888.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Headman of the tribe refused to hand over the offenders, the\r\nGovernment was driven {74} to avenge this outrage by sending an armed\r\nforce into the country of the Hassenzais and Akazais, who were held\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hazara Field Force]\r\n\r\nThis force, which numbered about 8,000 men, was organised in four\r\ncolumns, each formed of one British and two native regiments.  A\r\npeculiar feature of this force was that no regiment was allowed to send\r\nmore than six hundred men, which was a device to ensure the selection\r\nof a picked body of men.  The late Sir John McQueen, who was then\r\ncommanding the Punjab Frontier Force, was given command of the\r\nexpedition, and Colonel W. F. Gatacre was appointed his Chief Staff\r\nOfficer.  This was naturally a moment of the liveliest satisfaction and\r\nanticipation for him.  At last he found himself on active service; at\r\nlast he was to face the ordeal for which he had been training for\r\ntwenty-six years.\r\n\r\nThree of the columns marched out of Oghi on October 2, twenty-four\r\nhours' grace having been allowed beyond the time named in the ultimatum\r\nsent to the Maliks of the tribes.  No. 4 Column, under\r\nBrigadier-General Galbraith,[4] had assembled at Derband on the River\r\nIndus, and was known throughout the campaign as the River Column; its\r\nfunction was to prevent any trans-Indus tribes moving eastwards across\r\nthe river to join their neighbours, and it was hoped that the area of\r\nhostilities could thus be confined to those spurs of the Black Mountain\r\nwhere lay the heart of the disaffection.\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] The late Sir William Galbraith, K.C.B.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLONEL W. F. GATACRE, D.S.O., 1888.]\r\n\r\n{75}\r\n\r\nThe main mass of the Black Mountain lies in a curve of the River Indus\r\nbetween Thakot and Arab.  To the north and west its slopes are cut into\r\nridges which descend precipitously into the deep gorge of the river; to\r\nthe east the eye rests on a bewildering succession of pine-clad\r\nmountain ranges, till, stretching over the vale of Kashmir, it reaches\r\nthe line of eternal snows.\r\n\r\nThe three mountain columns met with little opposition as they made\r\ntheir way up the spurs overlooking the Agror Valley.  The Headquarter\r\nCamp was established at Khaim Gali, near the summit of the range, and\r\nfrom that point General McQueen directed the movements against the\r\nvarious villages.  After about a fortnight General Channer, commanding\r\nNo. 1 Column, was able to open up communication with General Galbraith\r\nin the valley below, at Kunhar.  The latter at the outset had met with\r\nsome slight opposition at Kotkai, resulting in the loss of two officers\r\nand five men, but had since made considerable progress up the river,\r\nand had moreover come to an understanding with the tribes in his\r\nimmediate neighbourhood.  The mountainous nature of the country made it\r\nextremely difficult to secure unity of action in the two regions.  It\r\nbecame imperative that General McQueen should know what General\r\nGalbraith had done and had promised.  To effect this purpose Gatacre\r\noffered to make his way down on foot to Kunhar, where the River Column\r\nhad its headquarters.\r\n\r\n{76}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Visits Galbraith]\r\n\r\nBy this time he was fairly well acquainted with the lie of the country,\r\nfor he had been out daily with the columns, and, according to his\r\ncolleague, Major Elles,[5] \"had worked harder than any man in the\r\nforce.\"  He must have known that the direct descent from the ridge on\r\nwhich the Headquarter Camp at Khaim Gali was situated was a series of\r\nprecipices.  Taking the figures given on a map compiled for the\r\nexpedition of 1891, the elevation of Khaim Gali is 8,680 ft., while the\r\ncamp at Kunhar in the Indus valley is 1,560 ft., which means a clear\r\ndescent of 7,120 ft. in a horizontal distance of less than five miles,\r\nthough the distance actually marched worked out at fourteen miles.\r\nMajor Elles accompanied Colonel Gatacre, and they took an escort of\r\nfifty Khybari Rifles.  The party left camp at 6 a.m., and reached\r\nKunhar at noon.  Although it was then October, the sun had great power\r\nin the middle of the day; the narrow valleys down which they crept were\r\nvery stuffy, and as they approached the end of the journey the air\r\nbecame very close and oppressive.  Major Elles confesses that he felt\r\nthe sun very much, was tired out, and \"could not have attempted the\r\nclimb back again that day.  But nothing,\" he says, \"seemed to tire\r\nGatacre, who was the hardest man I ever met.  He neither drank nor\r\nsmoked, and ate very little.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[5] Now Lieut.-General Sir Edmond Elles, G.C.I.E., K.C.B.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter settling the business that was the motif of the journey, and\r\npartaking of the hospitality of the River Column headquarter mess,\r\nGatacre {77} announced his intention of starting back at 2 o'clock.\r\nThe men who acted as escort were dismayed at the Colonel Sahib's\r\nstartling decision; indeed, only half of them were capable of setting\r\noff at once, but these insisted on being allowed to do so.  Half-way up\r\nthe mountain they were dead-beat; and as a small party able to take\r\ntheir place had been accidentally met with, the services of the\r\nnewcomers were impressed, and Gatacre proceeded.  It is a question for\r\nmountaineers whether the descent or the ascent was the more trying to a\r\nman's muscular system, and a question for Anglo-Indians whether the sun\r\nis hotter in the forenoon or the afternoon; anyhow, it must have been\r\nfairly fierce at 2 p.m. in the deep gorge of the Indus, and to have\r\nreached Khaim Gali again the same evening was an achievement worthy of\r\nmention in despatches.  We are told that the first part of the ascent\r\nwas very precipitous for about 2,500 ft., and impracticable even for\r\nmule carriage; the next 1,500 ft. was nothing but a succession of\r\nsteps.  Farther on, the line lay across terraced cultivation, which\r\ninvolved climbing up the walls supporting the fields, and walking\r\nacross the soft plough which they enclosed, while throughout the march\r\nthere were \"passages which were impossible for anything but a goat.\"\r\n\r\nAt 11 p.m. that same night Gatacre marched into the Headquarter Camp at\r\nKhaim Gali, the only man who had completed the double journey.  The two\r\nmarches had occupied six hours and nine hours respectively, and two\r\nhours only had {78} been spent in the triple business of negotiation,\r\nrefreshment, and repose.\r\n\r\nThis feat did not pass unnoticed at the time.  The editor of the _Broad\r\nArrow_ of October 20, 1888, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The story is suggestive of physical endurance and courage, and may be\r\nread with profit by fireside warriors and cynical philosophers upon the\r\ndecline of the British officer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Active service]\r\n\r\nSuch an exchange of views between a confidential messenger from\r\nHeadquarters and the officer commanding a column operating\r\nindependently must always have great military value to the commander of\r\nan expedition, and it is evident that the consultation in this case was\r\nnot without result, for in despatches we read that the first phase of\r\nthe operations reached its conclusion on October 20.  The Akazais and\r\nHassanzais made complete submission, and by the end of the month had\r\npaid their fines in full.  The object of the second phase was the\r\ncoercion on similar lines of the Parari Saiads and Tikariwals.  In the\r\nsame way this involved much marching and counter-marching over the same\r\n\"exigeant\" class of country.  Although there was scarcely any fighting,\r\ndoubtless all those who took part in these operations learned many of\r\nthe supplementary lessons of war which no manoeuvres can ever teach.  A\r\nBritish officer in a Goorkha regiment tells us how he learned one of\r\nthese lessons from Gatacre himself.\r\n\r\nThe Brigade had just reached its {79} camping-ground: there had been a\r\nvery arduous and hot march, finishing with a stiff climb up-hill.  The\r\nGoorkha officer had flung himself on the ground, feeling dead-beat,\r\nwhen Gatacre rode up, and began making inquiry as to the water supply\r\nof the camp.\r\n\r\n\"Who is the Quarter-Master of this regiment?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I am, sir,\" said the officer, struggling to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"What has been done to secure the water supply from contamination?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must have a guard put over it at once.  Where is the spring?\"\r\n\r\nThe spring was a thousand feet below.  The commanding officer of the\r\nregiment, coming upon the scene, protested that his officer had only\r\njust come up.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" said Gatacre.  \"It is of the utmost importance.  I order\r\nyou as Quarter-Master to go down and see that a sufficient guard is put\r\nround the spring, and that the animals are kept at a proper distance.\"\r\n\r\nMuch against his inclination the officer set about carrying out this\r\ninjunction.  On his arrival at the spring he saw the urgency of the\r\norder he was sent down to execute, and confessed the justice of the\r\ncall upon his further exertions.  Soldiers, bheesties, and animals were\r\ncrowding round the pool, which, fed by a small spring, was the only\r\nwater supply for the Brigade.  He quickly restored order, made\r\narrangements for {80} the watering of the different units, and, by thus\r\nsecuring the purity of the head-water, eliminated the chance of fever\r\nto thousands of men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1888-9]\r\n\r\nOn October 28 General Channer occupied Thakot without resistance; on\r\nNovember 7 a deputation from the Parari Saiads came in and made full\r\nsubmission, as the Tikariwals had done already.  On November 12 the\r\nHazara Field Force began to disperse, having been under arms for six\r\nweeks.  The casualties to the whole force amounted to twenty-seven men\r\nkilled, fifty-nine wounded, and eight who had died of disease, showing\r\nthat, from a military point of view, it was essentially a minor\r\ncampaign.  Moreover, politically, the results were inconclusive, but to\r\nGatacre it was the field on which he had won his spurs: \"the loyal\r\nsupport and valuable aid\" that he had afforded his Chief were now for\r\never recorded; his initiative, energy, and physical powers had been\r\nproved in the field; his possession of military ability and soldierly\r\nqualities in a marked degree was now established.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand why he was awarded the Distinguished\r\nService Order, which had been newly created as a recognition of the\r\nservices of junior officers in the field, while his rank as substantive\r\ncolonel in the army fully qualified him for a Companionship of the\r\nBath; but so it was.  Seven years had yet to run before the latter\r\ndecoration was awarded, after the Chitral Campaign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Safe home]\r\n\r\nColonel Gatacre and Major Elles did not return {81} direct to\r\nHeadquarters on the disbanding of the force, but made an extended march\r\ndown the Indus, and reached Calcutta early in December.  When writing\r\nhis Christmas greeting to his father, Gatacre says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We are all returned safely from the Black Mountain, and I must say I\r\nfor one thoroughly enjoyed myself; it was rough going, of course, but\r\nthe climate was good, and there was plenty of outdoor exercise--such a\r\npleasant change after the office life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter another summer spent at Simla, Gatacre was sent in October 1889\r\nto act for Sir George Wolseley, who was then commanding the Mandalay\r\nBrigade.  Throughout the three and a half years that he had served with\r\nthe Headquarter Staff, much of the work in the Quarter-Master-General's\r\noffice had had reference to the welfare of the troops which since\r\nNovember 1885 had been operating in Upper Burma.  Gatacre had taken\r\nmoreover a personal interest in the success and well-being of the Army\r\nof Occupation, for his brother John had been serving there in command\r\nof his regiment, the 23rd Bombay Infantry.\r\n\r\nThe events which had occurred since Gatacre first visited Mandalay in\r\n1883 will be dealt with in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{82}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n1889-1890\r\n\r\nMANDALAY\r\n\r\nIt was with difficulty that the British Government had lived so long at\r\npeace with Theebaw, King of Burma.  In 1883 he sent a mission to\r\nEurope, ostensibly to study western civilisation, but it was recognised\r\nthat in reality he was making advances to the French Government, who\r\nwere of course our neighbours on the east, in Siam.  There was also\r\nfriction over the demarcation of the Manipur frontier on the west, but\r\nthe actual ground for the outbreak of hostilities arose over a\r\ncommercial question.  An English trading company found that King\r\nTheebaw had sold over again to the French the rights over some forest\r\nlands for which the company had paid seven years' tolls in advance.\r\nThe High Court of Mandalay upheld their sovereign's proceedings, so\r\nthat the corporation were driven to appeal to the British Government to\r\nvindicate their claims.  King Theebaw, however, flatly refused to\r\ndiscuss the matter with the Chief Commissioner of Lower Burma.  The\r\nBritish Government welcomed the occasion to {83} send an ultimatum to\r\nKing Theebaw \"which aimed at a settlement of all the main matters in\r\ndispute between the two Governments,\"[1] and simultaneously instructed\r\nSir Harry Prendergast to prepare a force to march on Mandalay.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] _Parliamentary Papers_ (Burma), 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\nA defiant answer having been returned by the King, orders for the\r\nadvance were issued.  A fleet of transports was escorted by a few\r\nvessels from the Royal Navy up the Irrawaddy.  On November 14, 1885, at\r\na point about twenty-eight miles beyond our frontier post at Thayetmyo,\r\nthe forts at Minhla barred the passage of the river.  Our naval guns\r\nthen opened fire with good effect, and when the troops landed there was\r\nno resistance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Theebaw surrenders]\r\n\r\nThe advance continued, and ten days later a similar engagement took\r\nplace about seven miles from Ava.  After the naval guns had silenced\r\nthe enemy's artillery, the Hampshire Regiment was landed, and drove the\r\ndefenders from their entrenchments.  At 4 p.m. on November 24 a royal\r\nstate barge appeared bearing a flag of truce, and a message that the\r\nKing \"was well disposed in mind and heart.\"[2]  To this a reply was\r\nsent that nothing less than the unconditional surrender of the King and\r\nhis capital would satisfy the British Government, and that the response\r\nmust be received within twelve hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] Despatch dated January 13, 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe picturesqueness of the scene was so irresistible that even the\r\nofficial despatch breaks into description of the \"far-famed city of\r\nAva, {84} with its mouldering monasteries and decaying walls.  On the\r\nbanks are batteries bristling with guns, and parapets alive with\r\nscarlet-clad soldiers,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\nKing Theebaw's reply was received by the time specified, and when\r\ntranslated was found to express a frame of mind that was acceptable to\r\nthe invaders.  The subsequent advance from Ava was therefore unopposed,\r\nand on November 28 British troops made their way peacefully through the\r\nstreets of Mandalay.  In the afternoon of the next day the King and his\r\nQueens and a suitable retinue were conveyed on board a steamer and\r\ntransported to Rangoon, _en route_ to India.  As a compliment to their\r\nformer estate, the escort was detailed from the Royal Navy.  It is said\r\nthat Supya-lat offered violent resistance to this deportation, saying\r\nthat she would prefer death or any fate at the hands of the Englishmen\r\nto life as a state prisoner with her husband.  But she had to conform.\r\n\r\nBy Proclamation on January 1, 1886, Upper Burma was declared a part of\r\nthe British Empire, and the Chief Commissioner, Sir Charles Bernard,\r\ntransferred his headquarters from Rangoon to Mandalay.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dacoity]\r\n\r\nSir Harry Prendergast had completed his task in the occupation of the\r\ncapital, but the subjugation of the vast province of Upper Burma,\r\ncovering about 100,000 square miles, was a very different matter.  The\r\ncollapse of the Civil Government and the disbanding of the native army\r\nled to a state of anarchy.  Pretenders sprang {85} up who were\r\nexploited by enterprising ex-officers, and became leaders of the\r\nvarious bands of dacoits that infested the land.  These armed bands\r\nwere a terror to the people, for they lived on the country and robbed\r\nand looted freely but it was not till we had won the confidence of the\r\npeaceable peasants that they would venture to give us information as to\r\nthe whereabouts of their enemies.  The fact that there was no cohesion\r\nor community of interest between these marauders made them the more\r\ntroublesome to suppress, as each one had to be dealt with separately.\r\nThe pacification of the country was entrusted to Sir George White with\r\na force of three infantry brigades.  But as there was no national party\r\nin arms against him, so there was no organised resistance; the enemy\r\nwere not soldiers, but a lawless rabble led by brigands.\r\n\r\nIn his report of this work in a country which he describes as \"one vast\r\nmilitary obstacle,\" he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The actual resistance offered to our troops was not very trying to\r\ndisciplined well-armed soldiers, but small bodies of these soldiers\r\nhave often had to stand up against bands whose numbers were estimated\r\nin thousands.  Between April 1 and July 31 over one hundred affairs\r\ntook place, and few days elapsed without the occurrence of fighting in\r\nsome part of the newly acquired province.\"[3]\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] See _Despatch_, July 17, 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a time it was found possible partially {86} to replace the\r\nsoldiers by specially recruited armed military police, who were thickly\r\ndistributed in all the disturbed districts; and gradually the more\r\npeaceable inhabitants realised that every time a military raid was\r\norganised there would be a smaller number of thieves and robbers left\r\nin the land.\r\n\r\nWhen the bulk of Sir George White's expeditionary force was withdrawn,\r\nBrigadier-General George Wolseley, who had been commanding the Mandalay\r\nBrigade, assumed the command of the permanent garrison.  It was as his\r\nsubstitute that Gatacre held the post from October 1889 to October\r\n1890, with a few weeks' interval in the spring.  Gatacre had been\r\nnearly four years in the same office on the Headquarter Staff, and his\r\nletters show that after the departure of General Chapman in April 1889\r\nhe was anxiously watching for some new opening for himself.  The change\r\nto an independent command was very welcome, and not less so was the\r\nchange from the social life of Headquarters to the wild simplicity of\r\nUpper Burma.  The military direction of such a vast and unsettled\r\nprovince would provide scope for administration and opportunity for\r\npersonal exertion--would, in short, afford all the arduous duties in\r\nwhich Gatacre found his delight.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fort Dufferin]\r\n\r\nThe ancient citadel of Mandalay is now called Fort Dufferin.  It\r\nconsists of a vast quadrilateral enclosure, in the centre of which\r\nstands the palace, surrounded by gardens and a high teak-wood stockade.\r\nThe walls are 10 ft. thick {87} and 29 ft. high; each side of the\r\nsquare is a mile and a quarter in length; at regular intervals there\r\nare gates leading to bridges over a moat that is more than 200 ft.\r\nwide.  Along the walls are numerous picturesque watch-houses with\r\nlittle seven-roofed pagodas over each gate.  These buildings provided\r\nquarters and offices for both the civil and military departments.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Crosthwaite, who was Chief Commissioner of Burma when\r\nGatacre took up the command, writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I lived in one of the pagoda erections over a gate in the Mandalay\r\nwall, and there was a long flight of steps leading up to my rooms.  I\r\ncan see Sir William now flying up the steps and rushing down them,\r\nafter he had seen me, and vaulting on to his horse.  He was\r\nindefatigable.\"[4]\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] August 18, 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reception rooms in the palace itself were fitted up as a club for\r\nthe officers of the garrison.  Some men were playing whist there one\r\nevening in November 1889, when Gatacre came in, and going up to one of\r\nthe players asked him if he knew anything about transport.  The\r\nofficer, busy with his cards, replied \"Not a damn!\" which elicited the\r\nunexpected response:\r\n\r\n\"Will you be my transport officer?\"\r\n\r\nWhen the hand was finished the subaltern turned round, and for the\r\nfirst time perceived who was speaking to him.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid you are chaffing me, sir.\"\r\n\r\n{88}\r\n\r\n\"Not at all.  The last two transport officers I have had knew\r\neverything--one could not teach them anything.  Are you willing to\r\nlearn?\"\r\n\r\nThat officer did his best to learn, and remained Gatacre's transport\r\nofficer till his regiment left the station.  He remembers especially\r\nhis General's friendly manner, tells us how the dignity and power of\r\nhis personality enabled him to dispense with the formalities of his\r\nposition, and to do things which in other men might have resulted in\r\nundue familiarity.  There was an arrangement by which the other staff\r\nofficer carried on the work in the office, while the transport officer\r\naccompanied the General on all his tours.  It is to this officer that\r\nwe are indebted for the following story.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Maymyo]\r\n\r\nAbout forty miles from Mandalay there is a little hill-station called\r\nMaymyo, at an elevation of 3,500 ft.  It is now full of red-brick\r\nbuildings, and is the headquarters of the Lieutenant-General commanding\r\nthe Burma Division, and there is a railway up from Mandalay which runs\r\non to Lashio.  But in 1889 Maymyo was but a collection of huts and\r\ntents, and the road that led thither was not only execrable to travel\r\non, but infested with robbers.  However, it served as a sanatorium, and\r\nthe sick folk from Mandalay had to brave the dangers of the road.  The\r\ntransport officer had been spending a month at Maymyo with his wife,\r\nand, having met with exceptional difficulties in making his journey\r\ndown, was very much alive to its discomforts.  Only two days before\r\nanother party had been {89} attacked, their native driver killed, and\r\ntheir kit dacoited.\r\n\r\nWhen they met next morning the General told the officer to lay a dak to\r\nMaymyo, as he intended going there next day.  The thought of doing that\r\njourney again so soon was most distasteful, but the officer only asked:\r\n\r\n\"What time do we start?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no 'we' in it.  You don't go.  I am going alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's ridiculous!\" followed on, with such simplicity and directness\r\nthat both broke into laughter.\r\n\r\nThe idea was ridiculous, but it was carried out.  The subaltern's pride\r\nof office was wounded by his being thus set on one side, but when he\r\nrealised that it was done out of consideration to himself, and that no\r\none else was taken, he could not but be satisfied.  Risk and exertion\r\nwere like magnets to draw Gatacre; he went alone, dispensing even with\r\nan orderly.  The fastest and most active ponies were always sent out\r\nfor the General's use, and it would have been difficult to find man and\r\nbeast to keep up with him when on such an excursion.  He must have made\r\na very early start, for he rode forty miles up into the mountains,\r\ninspected the detachment of the Madras Native Infantry quartered there,\r\nand returned in time to dine with the Chief Commissioner.  There he met\r\nSir Frederick Fryer, to whom he related his day's work.  It afterwards\r\ntranspired that two of the ponies were broken down by the journey, but\r\n{90} even for such a mishap the General found a cheerful use.  When\r\nrallied by one of his commanding officers on this point, he replied:\r\n\r\n\"Hard on the ponies!  Not at all.  Why, my dear fellow, it is really a\r\ngood thing, for the useless ones get weeded out.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1886 Sir George White wrote that it would be a \"long time before\r\ndacoity died of inanition.\"[5]  But British methods, worked with\r\nBritish perseverance, had triumphed over Burmese institutions.  In 1889\r\nSir Charles Crosthwaite could write that \"disorder and lawlessness had\r\nbeen put down, and the power of the Government firmly established and\r\nfully acknowledged.\"[6]  It was, however, reserved for Gatacre to equip\r\na little expedition which was to penetrate into the Kachin Hills, where\r\na leader known as Kan Hlaing was harassing the country.  The General\r\nsent the following telegram to Calcutta on November 25, 1889:\r\n\r\n\r\n[5] _Despatch_, August 18, 1886.\r\n\r\n[6] _Report of Administration_, August 1887 to August 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Chief Commissioner has applied for services of troops to operate from\r\nBhamo against Lwe Saing Tonhon Kachins, in Meteilaing, to effect\r\ncapture or surrender of Kan Hlaing and reduction of Tonhon, the chief\r\ntown.  After effecting this, to march southwards in Binhong and attack\r\npretender Sairyawuiniz.  A column to co-operate from Ruby Mines\r\ndistrict, marching on Momeit.  Bhamo Column to consist of 75 rifles\r\nHants, two guns No. 2 Bombay, 100 rifles 17th Bengal Infantry, and 250\r\nrifles Mogoung Levy.

Column will start from Bhamo\r\nDec. 1.  The Momeit Column will reach Momeit about Dec. 10.  Solicits\r\nArmy's approval.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Kachin Bridge over which five hundred men crossed in one\r\nday]\r\n\r\nThe Bhamo Column was under Major Blundell's command, and the Momeit\r\nColumn under Major Greenway.  Lwe Saing was captured on December 23,\r\nand Tonhon on the 24th, after sharp fighting.  Early in January the\r\nforce crossed the Shweli River, which was a fierce mountain torrent, so\r\nstrong that the rafts were swept away, and a man drowned.  The passage\r\nover the various rocky streams was a great difficulty; in one place a\r\nswinging bridge was rigged up with transport ropes and timber; on\r\nanother occasion the whole column of five to six hundred men with their\r\nstores were passed over the Kachin Bridge shown in the picture.  A\r\nreport arrived that the rebel Prince Sawanai and the dacoit leader, Kan\r\nHlaing, were strongly stockaded at Manton, three marches farther on,\r\nand that he had a following of 2,000 men.  The two columns met as\r\narranged, and captured the village, though it was fiercely defended.\r\nBefore the force left Manton, Brigadier-General Gatacre and Colonel\r\nStrover, the Commissioner, joined the column.\r\n\r\nThe following letters give the General's own impressions of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n{92}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1890]\r\n\r\nIN THE DEFILE JUST BELOW BHAMO,\r\n\r\n_February_ 8, 1890.\r\n\r\n\"We expect a first-class trip, and should be away about six weeks.  We\r\ntake a month's provisions with us, and a fortnight's follow us.  There\r\nis a great charm to me in going into quite an unknown country, full of\r\nwild beasts and savages; there is nearly every animal under the sun\r\nsaid to be in these jungles, and the place has every appearance of it:\r\ntracks of all sorts along the river-banks.  But we shall soon see for\r\nourselves.  I fancy the scenery will be grand, and we shall probably\r\nget many beautiful orchids.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBERNARDMYO, _March_ 20, 1890.\r\n\r\n\"I have only a moment for a line to say I've 'come out alive' at this\r\nend of the country, which is fortunate.  It is one of the roughest\r\njourneys I have ever done, and we have been wet through for days, with\r\nno change possible; great mountains, with only goat tracks to move by,\r\nhad to be climbed two or three times in the day, which made going most\r\ntedious.  By marching from 5 a.m. to 6 and sometimes 7 p.m. we could\r\nonly do thirty miles a day; this was for a ten days' movement, so you\r\nmay imagine the country is rough.  It's a magnificent land,\r\nhowever--wild elephants, lots of tigers, and beasts of every\r\ndescription everywhere, and the inhabitants perfect savages, but clever\r\nbeyond measure at agriculture in their valleys, and on the hill-sides\r\nat weaving, knitting, basket-work, etc., of all kinds.  I went to find\r\nthe column I sent out some three months ago, and found it about 150\r\nmiles off; they had had a good deal of fighting, and lost a matter of\r\nthirty men, which was unfortunate, but it might have been {93} more.  I\r\nhave ordered them all back, except 100 men to hold a post at Mantone,\r\nfor if the rains commence I should never get them back at all, owing to\r\nthe impossibility of the roads.  I never saw such a desperate country\r\nfor roads, as they call them; a goat would be puzzled with some of them.\r\n\r\n\"I hope the Squire and all of you are well.  How I should like to see\r\nyou all, and have a dinner at Gatacre!  I have not had any real good\r\nfood for about two months, but, though rough, we enjoy what we do get.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A rough journey]\r\n\r\nThough the leader Kan Hlaing succeeded in effecting his escape, the\r\nexpedition had good effect, for his following was dispersed and his\r\nprestige broken.  To all those who had taken part in this \"rough\r\njourney\" it brought another clasp to their medal.\r\n\r\nOn March 27 Brigadier-General Wolseley reached Mandalay on his return\r\nfrom leave, and took over the command next day.  But before two months\r\nwere out, he was wanted to officiate elsewhere, and Gatacre was sent\r\nback to Mandalay.  He had been very sorry to \"give up charge,\" and was\r\nproportionately pleased to resume the command.  In his letters he\r\nspeaks of having initiated many experiments which interested him very\r\nmuch.  Writing to his sister in July 1890, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have commenced a Government farm here on a large scale, about eight\r\nhundred acres at present, but will run up to four or five thousand\r\nacres.  I have started elephant ploughs, as the ground is so hard owing\r\nto want of rain that the {94} ordinary bullock plough is not strong\r\nenough, and if we do not plough now the season will be too far gone to\r\nenable us to get a crop off the ground this year.  The elephant plough\r\nhas to be specially made, or the brute will pull it to pieces;\r\nsometimes they get frightened, and then it is best to clear out, for\r\nthough the plough weighs half a ton, it is nothing to a frightened\r\nelephant, who goes straight home with it through everything.  I hope to\r\nsend you a report on the working of the farm just now; the Squire would\r\nlike to read it.  I wish I had that big plough here that we used to\r\nhave at Coton; it would be just the thing for this land.  I forget how\r\nmany horses it took, but I should put a couple of elephants in.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Down with fever]\r\n\r\nDuring these summer months he suffered repeatedly from fever.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PALACE, MANDALAY,\r\n\r\n_July_ 22, 1890.\r\n\r\n\"I have got influenza, which is a great nuisance, as it keeps me from\r\nmy work, and the doctor warns me solemnly not to go in draughts and to\r\nkeep out of the sun; but as my present abode is merely a large gilt\r\nshed, about thirty yards square, with looking-glass panels open to the\r\nfour winds of heaven, it is rather difficult to follow his advice.\r\nFortunately the open air always agreed with me, and I feel better\r\nto-day, so I hope I may soon be all right again.  The rain keeps off,\r\nand I am afraid we shall have a famine if we do not get heavy rain\r\nsoon, for the rice will fail.  I wish I could hear somewhat of my\r\nfuture; it is a nuisance being left in doubt as to what I am going to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n{95}\r\n\r\n\"I wish I had the services of Payne for a bit in the palace gardens; I\r\nwould make them so pretty.  We have rocks, grass, water, everything\r\nthat one could wish to work upon, but have no artistic people who\r\nunderstand gardening.  I am working at it, and getting seeds, and hope\r\nto make it a pretty place by-and-by.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMYINGYAN, IRRAWADDY,\r\n\r\n_August_ 30, 1890.\r\n\r\n\"When I last wrote I was in full steam down the Irrawaddy with the\r\nChief Commissioner, but I got a bad go of fever, and the doctor put me\r\nashore, as he thought I would have a better chance.  I was rather bad,\r\nbut the cool breeze on the bank has made a wonderful change, and has\r\nquite pulled me round.  I've had no fever since I came, and am\r\nbeginning to feel all right again.  Of course, I haven't much walk in\r\nme, but that soon comes back with food--that's of course the difficulty\r\nin a place like this, but I've managed to get hold of a few chickens\r\nand cook them with my servant.  Some of them have turned out a success,\r\nothers smell of kerosine oil, but they all have to be eaten, so it\r\ndoesn't much matter.  I mean to go back to Mandalay in three or four\r\ndays, and shall be glad to get on my horse again, for it doesn't suit\r\nme to be on my back.  I have lots to do, and have a man to write from\r\ndictation, which saves me writing out long official letters, but still\r\nI'm anxious about many things which are being carried out at Mandalay.\r\nThis place is just opposite Pakoko, where John commanded for a long\r\ntime, and is very pretty, especially now the river is in full flood,\r\nmiles across (five or six at least).\"\r\n\r\n\r\n{96}\r\n\r\nS.S. \"GEORGE,\" ON THE IRRAWADDY ABOVE MANDALAY,\r\n\r\n_September_ 22, 1890.\r\n\r\n\"I'm off on my travels again, you see.  We started this morning on\r\ninspection duty at Bhamo and Shwebo.  We should arrive at the former\r\nplace on 26th.  We stay there two days, and then come down to Shwebo on\r\nright bank of river; the trip will do me good, I think, and will give\r\nme some relaxation while on board.  I'm better, but not up to much yet.\r\n\r\n\"I heard from the C.-in-C. Bombay, Sir George Greaves, to the effect\r\nthat he was applying for my services as A.G. of Bombay Army.  If I get\r\nthis it will be nice, and I should see a good deal of John.  It's a\r\nlong time since I've seen him now.\r\n\r\n\"The quail here have been abundant, and the snipe are coming in, but no\r\nbags have been made yet.  I only speak from hearsay, as I have been\r\nunable to go out myself, as you will understand.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you could all run up the river with me on this steamer; you\r\nwould enjoy the voyage--such beautiful scenery, and such a river.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A new post]\r\n\r\nIn October the \"rightful owner\" returned to the command at Mandalay,\r\nand Gatacre handed over finally.  He brought away many specimens of\r\nBurmese art and handicraft.  His own artistic faculties enabled him to\r\nappreciate all that was quaint or interesting in every locality that he\r\nvisited.  In later life he took great pleasure in showing his friends\r\nthe objects of value or beauty that he had collected, and {97}\r\nevidently looked back on these years of strenuous service with real\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nFrom Mandalay he brought away a teak-wood drum that had belonged to\r\nKing Theebaw.  It is cut out of a solid trunk, and stands about three\r\nfeet from the ground, weighs about a ton, and is covered with the most\r\nexquisite carving.  He took special pleasure in this piece of\r\nfurniture, and in a beautiful silver plate from the Shan States.\r\n\r\nIn November 1890 Gatacre relinquished his substantive post at\r\nHeadquarters, on his appointment as Adjutant-General to the Bombay\r\nArmy, with the temporary and local rank of Brigadier-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{98}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n1890-1894\r\n\r\nPOONA\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General Gatacre took over the duties of Adjutant-General to\r\nthe Bombay Army on November 25, 1890, under Sir George Greaves as\r\nCommander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\nHis deputy in the office was surprised to find that Gatacre was not so\r\nregular in his attendance as might have been expected, and noticed\r\nother signs that suggested that he was unhappy and had something on his\r\nmind.  His colleague was quite right.  Gatacre was indeed passing\r\nthrough a severe and prolonged trial, one about which he could take no\r\none into his confidence.  To his highly strung nature, in which the\r\nloftiest integrity was allied to the tenderest human feelings, a blow\r\nsuch as had fallen upon him must have wrung every fibre, and there is\r\nno doubt that he writhed under it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In adversity]\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that the General was bitten in the hand by a\r\njackal that was said to be mad.  His nerves being already unduly\r\nstrained, the poison (or the thought of it) got such a hold on him that\r\nthe howling of the {99} jackals kept him awake at night, and a terror\r\neven possessed him of their coming in through the open windows.  So\r\nreal was this obsession that he ordered iron railings to be fixed\r\noutside, and by thus convincing himself of the impossibility of such a\r\nthing, he gradually conquered the fantasies of his sick brain,\r\ntriumphed over his sleeplessness, and reaped the benefit to his general\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nWhat was really preying on his mind was not generally known till his\r\nfriends read of the dissolution of his marriage.  Gatacre was the\r\npetitioner, and there was no defence.  This news gave rise to a strong\r\nfeeling of sympathy with a man whose probity was unquestioned, and\r\nwhose attractive appearance and genial manners had already made him a\r\nfavourite in Poona.  There was in Gatacre a depth of faithful affection\r\nwhich nothing could kill; the generosity and kindliness of his judgment\r\nforbad his harbouring any thought of blame, and he clung with unaltered\r\nloyalty to memories of the past.\r\n\r\n            Love is not love\r\n  Which alters when it alteration finds,\r\n  Or bends with the remover to remove.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is from this time that we find him working with an _acharnement_,\r\nwith a restless and passionate self-obliteration that became an\r\nunconquerable habit.  Ambition stepped in to revive his interest in his\r\nprofession, and the service of his neighbour provided occupation for\r\nhis leisure hours.\r\n\r\n{100}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1890-4]\r\n\r\nPoona is not only the Headquarters of the Bombay Army, but for a good\r\npart of the year it is the residence of the Governor of the Bombay\r\nPresidency.  In the hot weather both civil and military officials\r\nretire to the country life of Mahabuleshwar, and in the cold weather\r\nspend a few weeks in Bombay City.  Thus all the year round there was a\r\nsuccession of official and social engagements; every one had rather\r\nmore to do than there was time for in office hours, and every one\r\nwanted to put in an appearance at such social functions as appealed to\r\nhis particular tastes.  Gatacre not only took part in all these events,\r\nbut was the prime mover and organiser of everything that went on--no\r\ncommittee of management, no horse-show, gymkhana, or display was\r\ncomplete without his name.  Amongst other details the programmes\r\nengaged his particular attention.  He had a special chalk which, when\r\nused on prepared paper, could be reproduced as a lithograph by a very\r\nsimple process.  He rapidly gained great facility in the use of this\r\nmedium, and there is now quite a remarkable series of exquisite\r\ndrawings that were thus reproduced.  A lively sense of humour animates\r\nsome of these efforts, more especially those that did duty as\r\nhunt-cards.  The card was the size of foolscap paper; each season had a\r\nnew drawing, but all were variations of the study of foxes, while words\r\nwere put into their mouths expressing the sentiments of the quarry\r\ntowards Doctor Bull's hounds.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.G.]\r\n\r\nThe position of Adjutant-General is one of great {101} influence, and\r\nthis influence Gatacre invariably used to promote the cause of\r\nuprightness and true benevolence.  There was no red-tape about him; he\r\nwas always accessible to all ranks, and instantly ready to deal with\r\nany emergency.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion the friends of a young officer wanted to get him out of\r\nthe way of temptation--the Adjutant-General detailed him to some\r\noutlying station.  On the other hand, a young cavalry officer from\r\nMhow, who was engaged to a lady in Poona, found himself unexpectedly\r\ndetained at Headquarters by the A.G.  If an officer and his family on\r\ntheir arrival were unable to find quarters, the A.G. would take the\r\nwhole party in, regardless of any previous acquaintance.  In the club\r\none day Gatacre noticed the name of a young officer on the Headquarter\r\nStaff posted up as having failed to pay his club account.  He sent for\r\nthe officer and paid his bill, choosing to come himself to the rescue\r\nrather than that a young fellow in an honourable post should suffer\r\ndisgrace.  Thus many an unrecorded kindness, many a deed of silent\r\nsacrifice, showed the natural generosity of his heart, showed his\r\nfreedom from any taint of bitterness.  Instinctively and deliberately\r\nhe endeavoured to obliterate his own sorrow by adding to the happiness\r\nof others, and in this way surrounded himself with an atmosphere of\r\nesteem and gratitude which reacted powerfully for his own benefit.  The\r\nofficer who succeeded him as Adjutant-General had worked in his office\r\nfor some time, and he {102} now writes that the thought of him revives\r\nthe \"deep impression of what a dear, good fellow he was, and how\r\nhospitable and kind.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1891]\r\n\r\nGatacre's efforts at hospitality once gave rise to much amusement on\r\nthe one part and dismay on the other.  He usually kept but a small\r\nstaff of servants, and dined at the club of Western India; but when\r\nthere was some special gaiety going on, he would fill his house with\r\nguests from the outlying stations, and instruct his bearer to engage a\r\ngood cook and other servants for the necessary period.  At the Poona\r\nRace Week one year Gatacre's friends were complimenting him on the\r\nexcellence of his arrangements, and stories were related as to the\r\nenormities of which native cooks are sometimes guilty in the\r\npreparation of the Sahib's food, and of their troublesome ways in\r\ngeneral.  One lady was particularly eloquent on the annoyance of having\r\nhad to part with her khansama only a few days before in order that he\r\nmight go and nurse his wife, who was dying.  Some one suggested a tour\r\nof inspection round Gatacre's house, which he had held up as a model\r\nestablishment.  When the party reached the cook-house, I leave you to\r\nimagine the lady's surprise and amusement at finding her own truant\r\ncook installed for the nonce in her host's kitchen!\r\n\r\nHis easy camaraderie of manner was so remarkable that a friend once\r\nasked Gatacre whether he had ever found that people took advantage of\r\nit, and treated him with undue familiarity, to which he replied that he\r\nhad {103} never known them try.  He defended himself with a dry and\r\nsubtle humour.  Assuming an impenetrable blandness of manner, he would\r\non occasion utter sarcasms so veiled that some men could scarcely tell\r\nwhether he was in earnest or not.  He was never angry, but he had a\r\ncommand of quiet language that made his remarks as stinging as they\r\nwere humorous.  The man on the pillory would feel the sting, and the\r\nonlooker would see the humour.\r\n\r\nWhen another friend asked him why he was taking so much trouble over a\r\nmatter that appeared outside the sphere of his interests, and scarcely\r\nworthy of the attention that he was lavishing on it, his reply seemed\r\nweighted with reproof as he said: \"I don't think I ever knew what the\r\nmeaning of the word trouble was.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Goes on tour]\r\n\r\nIn the province of Bombay the inspections take place in the cold\r\nweather between November and March; a spell of hot weather then\r\nprecedes the break of the monsoon early in June.  The rains last till\r\nSeptember, and are followed by another spell of hot weather, till the\r\nair cools down again to quite a pleasant temperature in November.  The\r\nfirst inspection tour arranged for the end of 1891 included a visit to\r\nthe regiments quartered at Kamptee in the Central Provinces.  Kamptee\r\nwas the Headquarters of the Nagpur District, to the command of which\r\nBrigadier-General John Gatacre, C.B., had been recently gazetted.  To\r\nthose who have heard of \"inspection fever\" (and even the best officers\r\n{104} are not always immune), it will be obvious that the station must\r\nhave been in rather a commotion at the idea of a visit from the\r\nCommander-in-chief only four days after the arrival of a new General\r\nOfficer Commanding.  But the new General was well known and trusted in\r\nKamptee, for he had already been in the station for three years while\r\nin command of his regiment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A railway accident]\r\n\r\nBetween 6 and 7 a.m. on November 5 the General was on the platform of\r\nNagpur Station awaiting the arrival of the train, when a telegraphic\r\nmessage came in, saying that there had been a serious railway accident\r\nto the Chief's train about nine miles away.  A message was sent back\r\nfor medical assistance, and as soon as possible a break-down gang was\r\ngot together, but it was nearly 11 o'clock before the relief train\r\nreached the spot.  General John tells us that the sight that greeted\r\nhim was more shocking than any battlefield.  Eight men of the North\r\nLancashire Regiment were killed outright, twenty-four were severely\r\ninjured; a European guard, both drivers and both firemen were killed;\r\nfive native passengers were also killed and eight wounded.  Beyond this\r\ntotal of eighteen deaths, four soldiers died within the next few days\r\nin hospital.  The framework of the carriages, the iron rails, and the\r\nmen's rifles--everything was amazingly crumpled up and distorted.\r\n\r\nThe permanent way at this spot runs along a thirty-foot embankment.\r\nThe whole train was derailed, both engines with their tenders, a\r\nhorse-box, and five or six coaches had rolled {105} to the bottom of\r\nthe slope; the next carriage, in which Sir George Greaves had been\r\ntravelling, was suspended half-way down the bank at an angle of 45°,\r\nthe body having been completely wrenched away from the platform; and\r\nthe last coach, which had been occupied by the staff officers--Gatacre,\r\nHogg, and Leach--was hanging in the most precarious position over the\r\nedge.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that the train was unusually long and heavy that day, as\r\nit was bringing some fifty men of the North Lancashire Regiment back\r\nfrom Chi-Kulda, a civil hill-station in the Berars, where a few sickly\r\nmen had been sent as an experiment.  When the railway officials at\r\nBudnari Junction found that the three coaches set aside for the use of\r\nthe Headquarter Staff had also to be attached, they feared that the\r\nengine would not be powerful enough to pull the train up a certain\r\nincline, and gave directions that a spare engine (which was meant only\r\nfor local shunting work) should be put on in front.  This supplementary\r\nengine was the cause of the misfortune, for the tyres of its wheels,\r\nhaving been mended, gave way under the unusual strain of a long\r\njourney.  The front engine left the metals, and, rolling over, pulled\r\nthe whole train along with it.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of the fatal cases were of course in the first two\r\ncoaches, in which the soldiers were unfortunately travelling.  Some (of\r\nthe poor fellows suffered fearfully from scalding, over and above\r\nterrible fractures and injuries; some were so inextricably wedged in\r\namongst {106} the wreckage that it was not till the relief train came\r\nup with jacks and crowbars that anything could be done to relieve their\r\nexcruciating sufferings.  None of the staff officers were hurt, but\r\nColonel Hogg had a narrow escape, for the end compartment, in which he\r\nhad been shaving a few minutes earlier, was completely staved in by\r\nimpact with the Chief's coach in front.\r\n\r\nIn the official report forwarded by Sir George Greaves we read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I desire to record with pleasure that the officers of the Headquarter\r\nStaff were conspicuous in their efforts to release the injured from the\r\nwreck of the train, especially Brigadier-General Gatacre, A.G.,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Leach, Military Secretary, and Captain Peyton,\r\nA.D.C., all of whom, at considerable personal risk, worked in under the\r\noverturned engines and carriages to get at the wounded.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were also miraculous escapes.  A gymnastic sergeant was\r\ntravelling in the first coach with two small dogs on his knees.  Owing\r\napparently to his trained activity, he was able to leap through the\r\nwindow, and thus escaped without injury from a compartment where all\r\nhis companions were killed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible the wounded were sent on into Kamptee under the\r\ncharge of their companions, and it was three o'clock before the train\r\ngot back again to pick up the staff officers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Such good sons\"]\r\n\r\nOn his arrival in Kamptee a telegram was handed to Gatacre, informing\r\nhim of his father's {107} death.  This was not unexpected, but for both\r\nbrothers it must have added a more profound and personal sadness to the\r\nhorrors with which the day had begun; and as next day they listened to\r\nthe Service read over the poor young fellows who had been so suddenly\r\nstruck down, their hearts must have been at Gatacre, where the same\r\nwords would soon be read over the old man of eighty-six whom they had\r\nso sincerely loved and reverenced.  Only a few days earlier they had\r\nsent a telegram of farewell in their joint names; and in due course had\r\nthe satisfaction of hearing that it had arrived just in time to please\r\nthe dying man, who murmured in response, \"I thank God for such good\r\nsons.\"\r\n\r\nOn April 1, 1893, Lieutenant-General Sir John Hudson took over command\r\nof the Bombay Army; only two months later he was killed by a fall from\r\nhis horse.  The Commander-in-Chief was taking his usual ride with\r\nColonel Leach, his Military Secretary, before breakfast on the morning\r\nof June 9, when his horse stumbled heavily, throwing Sir John forward\r\non his head.  Six weeks earlier Sir James Dormer, Commander-in-Chief in\r\nMadras, had met with his death while out tiger-shooting, so that this\r\nfurther catastrophe came with added force to the sister Presidency.\r\n\r\nGatacre had written home a few days before, saying how genial and\r\nkindly he found his new chief, with whom he was already on intimate\r\nterms.  It was always a great satisfaction to him to think that the\r\nhorse which had made {108} the blunder was not one of his choosing, for\r\nSir John had already sought his advice in the matter of getting himself\r\nprovided with chargers.  As chief staff officer it fell to him to make\r\nall the arrangements for the imposing ceremony that took place at 8.30\r\na.m. on the day following the tragedy.  Lord Harris, the Governor, came\r\ndown from Panchguni for the occasion.  By special instructions he\r\nplaced a wreath on the coffin in the name of Her Majesty the Queen, and\r\nnumberless similar tributes showed the respectful sympathy of the whole\r\narmy.  The Guard of Honour was furnished by the 2nd Battalion\r\nLancashire Fusiliers; all the troops in garrison, both in Poona and\r\nKirkee, accompanied by massed bands, took part in the solemn\r\nprocession.  It is said that five thousand men attended the funeral,\r\nand that the whole was so admirably thought out and arranged in the\r\nshort space of time that no confusion or difficulty arose at any point.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hands over]\r\n\r\nIn due course Sir Charles Nairne, R.A., became Commander-in-Chief of\r\nthe Bombay Army.  He was the last of the race, for during his tenure of\r\nthe office its name was changed, and he handed over as\r\nLieutenant-General Commanding the Bombay Army Corps.  The office of\r\nAdjutant-General was also renamed, but that was not until after Gatacre\r\nhad been succeeded by General Reginald Curteis.  Sir Charles was the\r\nthird Chief under whom Gatacre had served in this capacity in less than\r\nthree years.  But as these changes made no difference to Gatacre's\r\n{109} loyal service, so there seems to have been no difference in the\r\nhigh esteem in which his seniors held him.  When he relinquished his\r\npost, some eighteen months later, the same cordial regard had grown up\r\nwhich he always contrived to win from all those with whom he was\r\nassociated either officially or socially.  When I came to live in the\r\ncommand, about two years later, there was no household from whom I\r\nreceived a more genuine welcome than from Sir Charles and Lady Nairne\r\nand their personal staff.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1894 the Adjutant-General was appointed to the command of the\r\nmilitary district that had its headquarters at Bombay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{110}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n1894-1895\r\n\r\nBOMBAY\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Colara]\r\n\r\nAlthough the climate of Bombay, which is situated on the nineteenth\r\nparallel, did not offer the attractions of Poona, and although the\r\nappointment brought no promotion in army rank, still Gatacre welcomed\r\nthe change of work, and the accession of dignity and opportunity\r\nafforded by an independent command.  On January 30, 1894, his selection\r\nfor the command of the Bombay District was gazetted, and shortly\r\nafterwards he moved into the bungalow in the Marine Lines, which then\r\nformed the official residence.  Of this quaint building he was the last\r\ntenant, for three years later this relic of Old Bombay and its naval\r\nneighbour disappeared under the consuming flame of the Plague\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nThis house and the adjacent one which sheltered the Admiral were\r\nhistoric erections, being survivals of the days when the Englishman\r\nfirst pitched his moving tent in these regions.  For the original\r\ncanvas covering of the tent, \"jaffray-work,\" or plaited palm-leaves,\r\nhad {111} been substituted, which had to be renewed each year just\r\nbefore the monsoon broke; this roof was supported on wooden columns\r\nthat were the successors of the original tent-poles, and made a quaint\r\nfeature in all the rooms.  The canvas walls of the tent had been\r\nreplaced by Venetian shutters; the doors were made of cotton stuff\r\nstretched on a frame, which left a large space above and below the\r\neye-line.  The deep verandah, on which greenhouse creepers sprawled\r\nluxuriantly, covered a space wide enough to allow of dining and\r\nsleeping out-of-doors.\r\n\r\nThe weather is warm all the year round, and becomes exceedingly damp\r\nand oppressive in the spring and autumn, while in the summer the\r\nmonsoon winds bring a rainfall of nearly 300 inches in three months.\r\nWhite uniform is worn throughout the year, even on full-dress\r\noccasions.  At the extreme point of the island, in the breeziest and\r\nhealthiest situation, there are barracks for one British regiment, and\r\nhard by is the beautiful chapel raised as a memorial to those who fell\r\nin the Afghan Campaign of 1849.  It was an exceedingly pretty sight to\r\nsee a regiment of men all clad in spotless white file into their places\r\non a Sunday morning.  The rifle regiments wear their black buttons and\r\nornaments, and one would say that nothing could be smarter, until the\r\nreliefs bring another corps, who with their gold buttons and belts\r\nproduce a more brilliant effect.\r\n\r\nAccording to the military classification, {112} Bombay is a\r\nSecond-class District, held by a Brigadier-General, who is not really a\r\nGeneral Officer, but a full colonel with temporary rank.  A First-class\r\nDistrict is held by a Major-General, whose importance is further marked\r\nby the presence of an A.D.C.  There is, however, so much ceremonial\r\nwork peculiar to Bombay that the General often wished that he had been\r\ngranted the services of such a young officer, as a way of saving his\r\nregular staff.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Transports]\r\n\r\nGatacre held this command for more than three years--from January 1894\r\nto July 1897--but for eight months in the summer of the second year,\r\n1895, he was on active service in Chitral, and for the same period in\r\n1896 he was officiating at Quetta.  Owing to the difference in climate\r\nhe thus served for five drill seasons in succession.  Although these\r\ntwo short episodes will be dealt with separately, the fact that he did\r\nduty through the cold weather for three seasons in Bombay seems to\r\njustify also a study of the conditions peculiar to that command.\r\n\r\nSo far as the passenger traffic is concerned, Bombay is the port of\r\nIndia.  It is the quickest route to all the provinces, even as far east\r\nas Calcutta.  All the transports between England and India call at\r\nBombay, and the vast majority of troops are there embarked and\r\ndisembarked.  In consideration of the work entailed in arranging the\r\ntransport service, an extra Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General was\r\nallowed on the staff; practically this department of the staff office\r\nwas the shipping agency for all the reliefs {113} throughout India.\r\nNot only had the transhipping and railway arrangements to be made for\r\nevery regiment on its arrival and departure, and for drafts of men from\r\nevery branch of the service, but privilege passages had to be allotted\r\nto the innumerable officers and their families who, when going home on\r\nleave, hoped to avail themselves of the chance of a vacancy on a\r\ntransport.  The rule in allotting these passages was that the junior\r\nofficer should take precedence, Government having apparently in mind\r\nthat their scale of pay gave them the first title to consideration.  At\r\nthe same time, senior officers were often needed to take command of a\r\nship full of details, and sometimes had to be searched for, Army\r\nnursing sisters, too, had special claims.\r\n\r\nAll these conflicting interests gave rise to almost as many private\r\nletters as there were official applications.  Ladies and children would\r\ncome and live in Bombay in the hope of securing a vacancy at the\r\neleventh hour--a device which was often successful.  There were\r\nnumberless hard cases and jealousies over these passages, and many\r\nfunny stories were told.  It was whispered that if an applicant called\r\nin person on the General, her chances would be in direct proportion to\r\nher personal attractions.  The amount of baggage allowed was also a\r\nsource of infinite vexation.  Once a nursing sister, who had recently\r\nmarried an army surgeon, asked to be allowed to send her effects under\r\nher maiden name, as the scale of baggage allowed in her professional\r\ncapacity {114} was slightly higher than that considered sufficient for\r\na captain's wife.\r\n\r\nDuring the loading and unloading of these transports an officer of the\r\nGeneral's staff had to be continuously on duty to attend to any matter\r\nthat might arise, and to check the freight, live and dead.  This was a\r\ntedious and very irksome duty, and, considering the amount of work\r\ngoing on in the office during the winter months, the time thus spent\r\ncould be ill spared.  The General made a practice of calling in person\r\non all transports immediately before their departure, at whatever hour\r\nit might be, and soon after their arrival.  If a homeward-bound vessel\r\nwas starting on a midnight tide, he would dine in his picturesque white\r\nmess-dress, and thus be ready to go and pay his official visit of\r\nfarewell.  The house was a long way from the Bunder, so that this duty\r\ninvolved a drive of more than a mile, and a run across the harbour in\r\nthe Government launch, which was always at his disposal.  In that\r\nintensely Oriental setting the thrill of living (as it were) in the\r\nexchange, and seeing the great ships that go down to the sea carrying\r\ntheir load of joyful anticipations, was irresistibly moving.  Gatacre\r\nwas thus on terms of personal friendship with all the captains, and\r\nused to ask them to his own house.  As a Christmas recognition of such\r\nattentions, the captain of the _Victoria_ sent up a specially selected\r\nsirloin of English beef one year on the morning of December 25.  All\r\nwho have tasted Indian beef will know that this was a rare delicacy.\r\n\r\n{115}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Navy]\r\n\r\nBut transports were not the only vessels in Bombay Harbour.  There were\r\nships from the Royal Navy, ships from the foreign navies, and\r\nPeninsular and Oriental weekly mails, outward and homeward bound.\r\n\r\nBetween the navy and the army there was a strict etiquette regarding\r\nthe exchange of visits.  Writing from Bombay on November 3, 1909,\r\nGeneral Swann tells us that--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The procedure in the matter of ceremonial calling was for a staff\r\nofficer to go on board within twenty-four hours of a ship's arrival and\r\narrange for the exchange of visits between the captain and the general;\r\nthe first visit was made by whichever was the junior of the two, and\r\nboth visits were supposed to be over within the twenty-four hours.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch official visiting had also to be attended to with great\r\npunctuality in the case of foreign warships, and on these occasions a\r\nbottle of champagne would be produced at any hour, and the health of\r\nthe respective sovereigns ceremoniously toasted.  The General\r\nparticularly exerted himself to entertain these foreign guests.  When a\r\nRussian vessel was in the harbour he asked the captain and three or\r\nfour officers to breakfast at his house, inviting some ladies who could\r\ntalk French to come and entertain them.  On another occasion, when an\r\nItalian vessel lay at anchor, the General writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I got up in the middle of the night last night to take the Duke of\r\nSavoy and his staff out {116} hunting to-day.  He thoroughly enjoyed\r\nhimself, galloped to his heart's content, made himself very sore at the\r\nknees, and came home perfectly happy.  I got back just in time to dress\r\nfor parade service, but could not get time for breakfast.  Went to\r\nchurch, and got back to luncheon at 2.30.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1894-7]\r\n\r\nThe hunting days in Bombay were Thursday and Sunday mornings; horses\r\nwere sent on overnight.  The meet was at daybreak at a place reached\r\nafter about forty minutes in a train that left the station at 4.30 a.m.\r\nHounds moved off as soon as the light allowed.  It was a sporting\r\ncountry, for there were plenty of jackals, and the ground varied from\r\nsoft ricefields, enclosed by Irish banks, to hard rock and heavy sand\r\nin which prickly-pear hedges were disagreeably abundant.  The hunt\r\nusually returned to the Jackal Club Camp in time for the 8.30 train,\r\nand all the men got back in time to be at their offices by 10 o'clock.\r\nEvery one in Bombay has an office of some sort, for no one would live\r\nthere unless forced thereto by the necessity of fulfilling their\r\nvocation.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of the Bombay command was the constant semi-official\r\nattendances at the railway station and elsewhere.  Whenever His\r\nExcellency the Governor, or His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, or\r\nHis Excellency the Admiral Commanding the East Indian Squadron passed\r\nthrough the station, the General Officer Commanding was there to\r\nreceive him, or to see him off as the occasion demanded.\r\n\r\n{117}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Guests]\r\n\r\nIt was also his pleasure to meet any friends, official or private, who\r\nmight be arriving or departing by the mail.  There was hardly a week\r\nwhen his launch was not in attendance on the mail-boats.  These usually\r\narrived at daybreak, but for Gatacre no hour was too early.  One\r\nmorning the mail was to bring a general officer who was on his way to\r\ntake over a command up-country.  His son, already appointed as A.D.C.,\r\nhad come down to Bombay to meet his father, and had called at the Staff\r\nOffice on the previous day.  The General offered to take him on board\r\nin his launch, as he was himself going to fetch his guest home to\r\nbreakfast, and named the hour.  But when the General stepped into the\r\nlaunch next morning the A.D.C. was nowhere visible on the Bunder.\r\nAfterwards the young man turned up, and his father said with a\r\ncarelessnesss of speech which Gatacre was quick to detect: \"May I\r\nintroduce you to my son?\"  To which Gatacre replied: \"You may bring him\r\nup to me if you like.\"\r\n\r\nIt was one of the paradoxes of Gatacre's character that he was\r\nsometimes as punctilious about fine shades of etiquette as he was on\r\nother occasions kindly when such subtleties interfered with his mood or\r\nhis purpose.\r\n\r\nAll through the cold weather the General's house was full.  There were\r\nthe friends going by the mail to whom an invitation would be of the\r\ngreatest convenience; there were the friends arriving by the mail who\r\nmust stay one night to clear their baggage before starting up-country;\r\n{118} there were the friends who had entertained him when inspecting at\r\ntheir station, and whose daughters would enjoy the gaiety of the city.\r\nHe was very fond of ladies, and minutely thoughtful for every detail\r\nwhich might contribute to their comfort or pleasure while in his house.\r\n\r\nOver and above all these calls on his time there was still the\r\nsoldiering.  The district covered a considerable area, extending\r\nnorthward as far as Cutch-Bhuj in Kathywarj and including many inland\r\nstations such as Ahmedabad, Baroda, Surat, and Khandalla.  There was\r\nalso a detachment of the Marine Battalion in the Persian Gulf.  All the\r\narrangements had been made for an official visit to Bushire in the\r\nspring of 1896, and it was with great reluctance that the General gave\r\nup this trip when he found himself under orders for Quetta.\r\n\r\nIt was the soldiering that he loved, and it was for this love of the\r\nsoldiering that he deliberately overworked himself.  No personal\r\nconsiderations had any weight.  Having no one at home to watch over\r\nhim, he became recklessly irregular at his meals, and would sit up to\r\nall hours of the night writing--endlessly writing.  What kept him going\r\nwere the trips up-country to inspect the outlying regiments and\r\ndetachments; for in the train he would make up his arrears of sleep,\r\nand the rules of politeness secured his punctual attendance at\r\nmeal-time.  The uncertainty of his hours was a matter of some comment\r\nat the office, where no doubt it {119} gave rise to considerable\r\ninconvenience, and probably not less troublesome was his habit of\r\nutterly disregarding the usual luncheon interval.  The General was\r\nplayfully conscious of all these misdemeanours, for on bidding good-bye\r\nto his chief staff officer on his departure for Quetta, he said:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Office hours]\r\n\r\n\"Now you will be all right--with a brand-new General whom you can\r\neducate to attend the office regularly at eleven, and go home to tiffin\r\nat two.\"\r\n\r\nThis officer, however, bore him no grudge for his vagaries, and now\r\nwrites with great affection of his old Chief.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOONA, _September_ 17, 1909.\r\n\r\n\"As his staff officer there were two points he used to impress on\r\nme--'No difficulty' and 'No finality.'  Difficulties, like hills, were\r\nuseful for the exercise they give in surmounting them.  There is no\r\ndifficulty that cannot be overcome somehow.  No finality is the\r\nwatch-word of progress.  What may seem best to-day can be improved upon\r\nto-morrow, but that is no reason for deferring action indefinitely:\r\n'The best is the enemy of the good.'  Act on what seems good at the\r\nmoment, and trust to time and opportunity to find something better to\r\nact on later.  But act, and act promptly.  This, I think, sums up the\r\nprinciples he tried to instil into me, and his example illustrates his\r\nteaching.\r\n\r\n\"I never served under a chief who thought more quickly, decided more\r\nreadily, or acted more promptly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the last week of November 1894 the {120} Viceroy, Lord Elgin,\r\narranged to hold a Durbar at Lahore.  There was to be a great gathering\r\nof the native princes of the Punjab, and a concentration of British,\r\nNative, and Imperial Service troops.  The Viceroy and the\r\nCommander-in-Chief both had large camps, to which they invited guests\r\nfrom all parts of India.  Having received the offer of a tent and the\r\nhospitality of his camp from Sir George White, Gatacre selected the two\r\nbest-looking chargers in his stable and repaired to Lahore in the\r\nhighest spirits.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1894]\r\n\r\nIn a letter written a little later, however, he confesses that it was\r\nnot the attractions of the Durbar that took him so far out of his\r\ncommand at such a busy time of the year, but the expectation of seeing\r\nsome one again whom he had recently met as she passed through Bombay.\r\nFor the guests a Durbar week is a holiday; the General was a free\r\nman--he had only to look on and enjoy himself.  There were many\r\nofficial functions where every one was gloriously apparelled, but he\r\nlooked as splendid as any in that brilliant company; and there were\r\nmany social festivities which afforded opportunity for daily\r\nintercourse.  It was during the picturesque pageants of the Lahore Week\r\nthat I came under the spell of the General's charm.  To know him was to\r\nlove him, as many another has since said to me.  During that week we\r\nlearnt to know one another, and at the end of it he wrote a frank manly\r\nletter to my father, Lord Davey, begging him to sanction the idea of\r\nour marriage.  {121} I regret that the kindly reply to his honest\r\nexposition of the whole matter has not been preserved; its purport\r\nbeing in accordance with our hopes, the engagement was made known, and\r\nI had the gratification of hearing my General's praises on all sides.\r\n\r\nIn some letters of December 1894 he intentionally writes about himself,\r\nand supplies us with the incentives which inspired him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am always thinking of how I can get on, not for the sake of the\r\nmoney it brings, but for soldiering itself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Soldiering first]\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will not mind my love of soldiering and work; it has such a\r\nfascination for me, I am inclined to put it first always.  But my love\r\nfor you will stand out first, and your love for me will enable me to\r\ncarry out my work at personal inconvenience to ourselves, won't it?\r\nYou see I am cunningly trying to get you to overlook my endeavours to\r\nthink of soldiering as the first thing, but, dear, you will always be\r\nin my heart all the time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was by contrast with the slackness natural to the soft\r\nclimate of Bombay that Gatacre's indomitable spirit attracted so much\r\nattention.  Colonel James Arnott writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Working, as I did, in the Civil Department, I had no official\r\nassociation with your husband, and it was only when he commanded the\r\nBombay District that I got to know him at all well.  I was much\r\nimpressed by his keen interest in his {122} profession, his strong\r\n_esprit de corps_, his enthusiasm for work, and the activity and\r\nstrength which enabled him to carry it on in a way to stimulate others.\r\nI have a clear recollection of his active figure and his first-rate\r\nhorsemanship, riding, as he often used to do, bare-backed, an\r\nindication of character and of those qualities so necessary in a\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\n\"General Gatacre took his share in everything of public interest in\r\nBombay, but I shall only refer to the very successful Assault-at-Arms\r\nwhich he organised--the first and best thing of the kind that I saw in\r\nmy long residence in Bombay.\"[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] September 13, 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first tournament]\r\n\r\nThis tournament was a great event.  The large grass-covered enclosure\r\nknown as the Oval was borrowed from the Municipality for the purpose of\r\na Grand Naval and Military Display and Assault-at-Arms.  This space,\r\nflanked on one side by the Town Hall, and on the other open to the sea,\r\noffered every facility for such an undertaking.  Admiral Kennedy, who\r\nwas in residence for Christmas, willingly co-operated; his handy men\r\nrendered most valuable assistance, the naval element lending a\r\ndistinction of which only a Bombay Assault-at-Arms could boast.  An\r\nattractive programme was made out and entries were invited from all the\r\nstations in India.\r\n\r\nIt was of course necessary to get subscriptions and guarantees; but the\r\nGeneral was already personally acquainted with all the leading men in\r\nBombay, and had no difficulty in {123} getting what he wanted.  The\r\nGovernor and the resident native princes gave their support and\r\npatronage, and many wealthy merchants, realising the great local\r\nexpenditure that such a tamasha must involve, contributed generously.\r\nIn the friendly relations established with the citizens of Bombay over\r\nthe multifarious business of this tournament lay the secret of the\r\nfacility with which Gatacre two years later won them to accept his\r\nviews about segregation.\r\n\r\nEvery detail of the entertainment had the General's personal attention;\r\nhis fertile brain organised and perfected the whole and every part, his\r\nhands painted the scenery of the Soudan Village, his horse carried the\r\nofficer's daughter who, in the gay uniform of the Royal Horse\r\nArtillery, opened the proceedings by presenting His Excellency the\r\nGovernor with a programme in a silver case.  The incessant labour\r\nentailed by this vast undertaking, and the strain necessary to honour\r\nall its calls upon him while carrying on simultaneously the routine of\r\nhis official life, can be best expressed in his own words.\r\n\r\nWriting on the Thursday before the tournament, which was to open on\r\nMonday, December 17, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Before I met you I thought there was only one thing in the world, and\r\nthat was soldiering; now I think there are two, but the soldiering is\r\nat present the only one I have got.  I have been busy to-day, and in a\r\nfever about the whole thing.  I have been calling on the Italian ship,\r\ndrinking 'The King and Italy,' again very bad {124} when one has fever,\r\nI should say; but no matter, the champagne was very good.  The levee is\r\njust over, the whole world pouring before Lord Harris, and now I am\r\ngoing to paint till about 3 a.m. to-morrow.  I have half a town to do,\r\nand no one seems able to originate anything.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 18th, after the first day's performance, he writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What will you say to me, not writing to you yesterday?  But if you\r\nonly knew the sort of day I have had!  First I was busy in the office,\r\ncould not move from my chair till 4 o'clock p.m.; then I had to dress\r\nand meet H.E. the C.-in-C. at the station at 4.45, then to meet the\r\nAdmiral at the Apollo Bunder a mile away at 5 o'clock--all official\r\nreceptions; then to go to the Tournament to see all was right, finish\r\npainting scenery, entertain the Governor's party at dinner, go to the\r\nTournament, watch it till 1 a.m., then drink 'the King and Italy' with\r\nthe Italian officers, who remained till the last.  Finally, at 2 a.m.,\r\ncommence to count with an enormous staff of clerks 10,000 tickets, to\r\nsee if the money was right.  You see, I am responsible, and I like to\r\nbe sure what we are doing.  Well, dearest, the thing was a tremendous\r\nsuccess.  We sold 10,000 Rs. worth of tickets last night, shall sell\r\nprobably 11,000 Rs. to-night, and so on.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tent-pegging]\r\n\r\n\"Everything went well.  The light was not as good as I should wish, but\r\nit was fair.  We had no accident in the ring, but got a horse killed\r\nafterwards, his leg being broken by a kick....  Well, I finished these\r\nbeastly tickets at 4 a.m., and at 7 had to go tent-pegging for an hour,\r\nand since then have never sat down, so you see why I did not write.\r\nNow it is 5.30 {125} p.m., and I am so tired--or at least my eyes are;\r\nand I shall not have a chance to rest till 5 a.m. to-morrow; it will\r\ntake us all that time to check the takings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 21st, when it was all over except for the prize-giving and the\r\ncongratulations, he writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have fever this morning; have not had any sleep for days, and had to\r\nrun in the Open Competition for Officers' Tent-pegging, which I won\r\neasily, taking both pegs and then touching two more turned on edge.  I\r\nwas rather pleased, as no one else touched one sideways at all, and all\r\nwere about twenty years younger than I!  My team ran fourth for the\r\nDuke of Savoy's Cup; my men could not ride well enough; I got both mine.\r\n\r\n\"To-day is the final ceremony.  You have never seen such an\r\nextraordinary multitude; tens of thousands of children, who pay one\r\nanna each, crowding round the place endeavouring to get an entrance.  I\r\ndo wish you were here to see the unusual activity reigning in the town\r\nand the excitement we have caused.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the novelty of the thing that gave importance to this\r\ntournament; the idea has since been carried out in many stations with\r\nmarked success.  It is interesting to note that such a gathering has\r\nalso an indirect value; it promotes camaraderie between different\r\nbranches of the service, and shows how much pleasure may be provided to\r\nboth competitors and on-lookers by what was essentially \"soldiering\" in\r\nits inception.\r\n\r\n{126}\r\n\r\nIn _The Times of India_ we read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"At the close of the Commander-in-Chief's speech three ringing cheers\r\nwere given for His Excellency and a similar number for\r\nBrigadier-General Gatacre.  The Commander-in-Chief having then left the\r\narena, the troops left the ground with bands playing, the men-of-war's\r\nmen as a special and well-deserved honour being escorted to the Apollo\r\nBunder by a regimental band, and followed by a large crowd of\r\ncivilians.  Several of the troops in camp on the Oval visited the\r\nflagship H.M.S. _Bonaventure_, and the turret-ship _Magdala_ yesterday\r\nmorning, while others were taken for a cruise in the harbour, a number\r\nof the up-country native troops being taken on a visit to inspect the\r\nlocal cotton mills.\r\n\r\n\"The work of demolishing the enclosure and removing the plant has\r\nalready begun, and to-day the majority of the troops will be _en route_\r\nfor their up-country stations, many of them taking back prizes and\r\nother mementoes of the well-organised, well-managed, and finest\r\nmilitary display and gathering of its kind ever held in the East.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was all over Gatacre took ten days' leave to Calcutta,\r\nwhere he was welcomed with surprise and pleasure by his friends of the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{127}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n1895\r\n\r\nCHITRAL\r\n\r\nThe annual inspections in the Bombay District for the season 1894-5 had\r\nall been carried out, confidential reports were rapidly being filled\r\nin, and got ready to forward to Headquarters, the arrangements for the\r\nsailing of the last transport were all settled, and all work was\r\nbeginning to slacken in Bombay with the approach of the hot weather.\r\nGatacre was making a push to conclude the season's work with a view to\r\ntaking eight months' leave to England.  In theory this long leave can\r\nbe secured once in every five-year command; but Gatacre had now\r\ncompleted two such appointments without availing himself of this\r\nprivilege, having been content with the sixty days' leave allowed each\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nBut whatever might be the special reasons which drew him homewards in\r\n1895, a better thing still was in prospect for him: in whole-hearted\r\njoy he writes on March 15:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am so pleased: have got a telegram from {128} Sir George White\r\nsaying, 'Have nominated you to command Third Brigade in Division to be\r\nmobilised for possible service Chitral.'  This is a first-class\r\nbusiness, for though it will prevent my coming home so soon, still it\r\nis a step onwards, and that is what we want, isn't it, dear?  I am so\r\npleased at getting this chance, and will do my best for your sake and\r\nmy own.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Third Brigade]\r\n\r\nThe Chitral Relief Force was under the command of Sir Robert Low; the\r\nexpedition was organised to effect the relief of Surgeon-Major\r\nRobertson, I.C.S., and some half-dozen officers who were shut up with a\r\nsmall garrison in the fort at Chitral.  We are not concerned here with\r\nthe internal events which had culminated in the siege of the fort by a\r\nhostile faction; suffice it to say that the Government of India\r\nregarded the matter as very urgent, and were sending a strong division\r\nof both British and Native troops to their assistance.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Low's force was to approach from the south over the Malakand\r\nPass, and to make its way up the valley of the Chitral River.  This was\r\na route which had not hitherto been used by the Indian Government, and\r\ncovered about 185 miles.  Communications with Chitral had previously\r\nbeen maintained from the north-east, via Gilgit.  During the winter\r\nmonths this latter route was closed, as the road lay over snow-covered\r\npasses; the distance was about 160 miles from Gilgit, and this was the\r\nrecognised access and the base of supplies for the little garrison.\r\nAnd so it came about that, {129} in response to messages from Major\r\nRobertson, Colonel Kelly was endeavouring to reach him from Gilgit,\r\nundismayed by almost impassable winter snows, at the same time that the\r\nIndian Relief Force was advancing with similar intention from Peshawur.\r\n\r\nIn a letter from Mian Mir, March 24, 1895, Gatacre writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I leave to-morrow to take command of my Brigade at Hoti Mardan, about\r\ntwenty-five miles north-east of Peshawur, and we shall march from there\r\non April 1, right away for Chitral; but without doubt we shall have\r\nsome rough work and some fighting.  Umra Khan knows he will have no\r\nmercy after destroying Captain Ross's detachment, and will do his best\r\nto raise the whole border against us.\r\n\r\n\"I have four first-class regiments--the Seaforth Highlanders, the\r\nBuffs, the 25th Punjab Infantry, the Second 4th Ghoorkas, and we are\r\nall sound and prepared to go anywhere, so I hope we shall all come well\r\nout of it.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\"I think myself we shall have to drop our tents, small as they are, and\r\nmarch without them.  Our difficulty will be crossing deep rivers; we\r\nshall have no boats, and must trust to making rafts of skins and\r\nfloating the men across; but it is always a shaky business when there\r\nare bullets flying about.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 30, in drenching rain, the first troops marched out of Hoti\r\nMardan; on April 2 they met the enemy, who were lying in wait for them\r\non the slopes of the Malakand Pass.  But {130} in this and the\r\nsubsequent engagements on the banks of the Swat and the Panjkora\r\nRivers, the Third Brigade took no part, being held in reserve.  A\r\nstirring account of the fighting is given by Colonel Younghusband in\r\nhis _Story of the Guides_.\r\n\r\nA bridge of rafts was thrown across the Panjkora River; the Guides\r\nCavalry and Infantry were passed over on the afternoon of April 15,\r\nwith orders to reconnoitre certain villages early the next morning.\r\nBut in the night a flood arose, huge trees crashed down on the swollen\r\nstream, completely wrecking the bridge.  Two miles below this point,\r\nthe Sappers were rigging up a suspension bridge; and in the meantime an\r\nattempt was made to float the men across on rafts supported by\r\nmussocks, or inflated goat-skins, and navigated by native boatmen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A rescue]\r\n\r\nGatacre, whose brigade was still in the rear, had pushed forward to see\r\nwhat was going on, and stood by the river's edge watching this \"shaky\r\nbusiness.\"  Suddenly a raft on which four men were seated got out of\r\ncontrol, broke away from the guiding rope, and was immediately caught\r\nby the current, and swirled down the turbulent stream.  In an instant\r\nGatacre jumped on his pony, and dashed at full gallop over the rocky\r\nground in the wild hope of reaching the spot where the bridge was being\r\nmade in time to warn the Sappers, and attempt a rescue.  The bend of\r\nthe river gave him time; with equal promptitude Major Aylmer got into a\r\nsling-cradle, and was lowered in mid-stream {131} just as the raft came\r\nin sight.  Two men only were still on it, one of whom saw his chance\r\nand grasped the extended hand.  As the river had narrowed from 200\r\nyards to ninety feet, the raft was travelling at a tremendous pace.\r\nThere was a moment of thrilling strain on the ropes; the cradle was\r\nsubmerged by the sudden pull; but all held on heroically, and Aylmer\r\nhad the satisfaction of bringing Private Hall safely to land.  The\r\nother man, together with the two comrades who had been thrown off in\r\nthe wild descent, were hopelessly lost.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See Sir Robert Low's _Despatch_, April 18, 1895, par. 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly on April 17, the bridge being completed, the advance was resumed.\r\nIt was here that the Third Brigade got its chance.  An officer writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I can well recall our intense joy when we found ourselves going over\r\nthe Panjkora Bridge in front of the Second Brigade, which had been\r\nleading since we left the Malakand.  With feverish haste we packed our\r\nmules, having moved our camp the night before, so as to be as close as\r\npossible to the bridge.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBy 10.45 the Third Brigade, accompanied by the Guides Cavalry and the\r\n11th Bengal Lancers, were all across, and orders were received for a\r\ngeneral advance on Miankalai, which was being held against us.  Sir\r\nRobert Low's despatch runs:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I pushed on to Ghobani with the Third Brigade, arriving there soon\r\nafter noon.  The enemy had then collected on a bluff in two villages\r\nwest of Mamugai.  The battery came into action {132} about 12.30 p.m.,\r\nand the enemy soon fell back under cover.  The Seaforth Highlanders and\r\n4th Goorkhas moved up to the south side of the valley, and then\r\nadvanced against the enemy in a westerly direction, driving them back\r\nfrom spur to spur, and eventually arrived at the bluff mentioned about\r\n4 p.m., which they occupied for the night.\r\n\r\n\"The enemy on this occasion did not show the bold front of previous\r\ndays, but retired as the infantry advanced; and though the guns were\r\nsent forward about 1,000 yards to hasten their retreat, the loss of the\r\nenemy was not great.  Throughout the action the troops were well\r\nhandled by Brigadier-General Gatacre, D.S.O.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\"The same afternoon Brigadier-General Gatacre with the Buffs, the 4th\r\nGoorkhas, half of No. 4 Company Bengal Sappers and Miners, No. 2\r\nDerajat Mountain Battery, and the Maxim guns of the Devonshire Regiment\r\npushed on to Barwa, _en route_ for Dir and Chitral, with twenty days'\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\"On the afternoon of April 20 Brigadier-General Gatacre sent a message\r\nback to me that Major Deane, chief political officer, had received news\r\nthat the garrison of Chitral was reduced to great straits, and that the\r\nmines of the enemy had reached to within ten yards of the fort, and he\r\nsuggested that he should advance rapidly with a small body of five\r\nhundred men.\r\n\r\n\"To this I consented, as being the only way of passing quickly through\r\nthe intricate country we were now traversing, and the only chance of\r\nrescuing the garrison.\"[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] See Sir Robert Low's _Despatch_, April 19, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n{133}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Flying Column]\r\n\r\nThe excitement and joyful anticipation amongst those who were to\r\ncompose the Flying Column were intense.  One of them writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We had intended pushing on over the Lowari Pass without baggage\r\nanimals, the paths being unfit for even mules without much tedious and\r\nlengthy preparation.  Every officer and man was to have carried ten\r\ndays' supplies on his back, and I had already broken up the General's\r\nmess stores into suitable 40-lb. loads for hillmen to carry for us.  In\r\norder to do this I only got to bed at our Janbatai camp at 1 a.m. and\r\nhad to be up at 3 a.m.; so you can imagine it was impressed on my mind.\r\n\r\n\"The dear General was, I fancy, awake all night, partly on account of\r\nthe painful abscess that had been lanced that evening; but in spite of\r\nthis he marched with us all next day, standing in his stirrups, because\r\nof the pain of sitting; and indefatigably urged on our bridging and\r\nroad-making parties.  After our arrival at Dir, having marched twenty\r\nmiles and made the road and bridged the streams _en route_, the General\r\nwould not rest or dine till the last of the transport mules had been\r\npiloted with lamps over a very difficult and rocky part of the path,\r\njust outside Dir.  I fancy we dined at about 9.30 p.m.; but this was no\r\nunusual thing, for the General always insisted on seeing to the comfort\r\nof his brigade before his own, and I hardly ever managed to induce him\r\nto sit down to dinner till some time between 9 and 10 p.m.\"\r\n\r\nBut much to the chagrin of the five hundred they were a flying column\r\nfor twenty-four hours only, for on the 22nd news was received that the\r\nsiege, which had lasted forty-six days, had {134} been raised.  It was\r\nafterwards ascertained that Colonel Kelly had reached the fort at 2\r\np.m. on the 20th, and that Sher Afzul and his supporters had fled the\r\nprevious day.  The General says nothing of his personal disappointment\r\nin the letters of this date, but when he was in the fort a month later,\r\nhe writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I wish they had let me loose as I wished, when we reached the Swat\r\nRiver.  I should have been in Chitral before Kelly, though he had only\r\nhalf the distance to go that I had.  But G.O.C. wanted to move with a\r\nunited force.  Of course we all hold different views regarding the best\r\nway of doing these things, but had I had the doing of it, I would have\r\nmoved by separate lines, one brigade in advance; one would have got on\r\nquicker, and more effectively.  But this is only between you and me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Goorkhas crossing the Lowari Pass]\r\n\r\nThe campaign now entered into the second phase; the fighting was over,\r\nbut not so the work.  The Government decided that the Third Brigade\r\nshould proceed to Chitral.  Having already reached Dir, they had\r\ncovered nearly two-thirds of the distance according to the map, but the\r\nmost difficult part of the journey was ahead of them.  The Lowari Pass,\r\n10,450 ft. high, was covered with deep snow, and the valleys leading up\r\nto it on both sides were known to present almost insurmountable\r\nobstacles to the passage of a large body of men and animals.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from _Trans-frontier Wars_ (vol. i. p. 544) gives\r\na good idea of the physical features of the country to be traversed.\r\n\r\n\r\n{135}\r\n\r\n\"Throughout its entire length from Dir to Ashreth, the road was a mere\r\ngoat-track, offering extraordinary difficulties to the passage of\r\ntroops, and requiring extensive improvements before laden animals could\r\nfollow it.\r\n\r\n\"The route to Gujar, at the foot of the pass, lay for eleven miles up\r\nthe Dir Valley beside the tumbling snow-fed torrent that streams from\r\nthe south side of the pass.  The track was in general extremely\r\ndifficult, frequently losing itself among the boulders that choked the\r\nbed of the stream, and rising steeply to traverse the face of a rocky\r\nbluff, only to fall again with equal abruptness on the other side.\r\nThis portion of the road had to be realigned and reconstructed\r\nthroughout, the river had to be bridged in three or four places, and\r\nstone staircase ramps had to be built in the water at more than one\r\npoint, to enable laden animals to pass where the stream washed the foot\r\nof a precipitous cliff.  From Gujar, 8,450 ft., to the summit of the\r\npass, a distance of three miles, the track lay over frozen and often\r\ntreacherous snow, at first at a fairly easy gradient, but growing\r\nsteeper and more slippery as the pass was approached.  Beyond the crest\r\na great snow cornice, 15 ft. in height, overhung the head of the glen,\r\ndown which the track descended for about 1,000 yards at a gradient of\r\none in three or four, over vast drifts of avalanche snow, in which\r\ngreat rocks and the uprooted trunks of gigantic trees lay deeply\r\nembedded.  From the foot of this descent the route lay down a steep and\r\nrocky gorge, now following the tangled bed of the torrent, now winding\r\nthrough fine forests of pine and cedar, or traversing open grassy\r\nglades clogged with the drainage of melting snows.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n{136}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The advance]\r\n\r\nIn such a struggle with the forces of nature Gatacre was at his best.\r\nNo difficulty dismayed him; his own passionate belief in the power of\r\ngoodwill and hard work to overcome every obstacle inspired the whole\r\nforce.  The men learnt to work hard because he expected it of them and\r\nseemed always present to appreciate their efforts.  They learnt to\r\nendure every hardship because he endured physical discomforts as great\r\nas theirs.  Some few men were attacked with frost-bite, and the General\r\nwas amongst the number; it caught him across the knuckles, and put him\r\nto great inconvenience.  They saw him daily riding up and down the\r\nroad, ministering to their comfort and their safety; and they realised\r\nthat as a master he was one whom all good workmen delight to serve,\r\nbecause he made himself their servant.\r\n\r\nAn officer who is now a Brevet-Colonel and has since served in Egypt,\r\nin East Africa, and in Natal, writes thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have seen a good deal of active service, but nowhere have I met any\r\nofficer, either of high or low rank, who more completely gave himself\r\nup to ensure the comfort of the troops under his command than the dear\r\nGeneral.  Nothing escaped his eagle eye: at one moment we were\r\narranging that some picket should protect itself better against the\r\nwind and rain; at the next the General was showing how a shelter should\r\nbe run up over the tent of some sick officer, to protect him from the\r\nheat of the or describing how better troughs could be for watering\r\nhorses or mules.\r\n\r\n{137}\r\n\r\n\"As to road-making, the General was unsurpassed.  From the very\r\ncommencement of the expedition he realised that good communications\r\nmust be ensured; and made our brigade work as I have never seen any\r\ntroops work, except Egyptian troops on the railway in the Soudan.\r\nMorning, noon, and night did every available man slave away at\r\nbettering the wild mountain paths which were our only link with our\r\nsupplies and civilisation.  The country supplied absolutely nothing but\r\na little hill grass obtainable in some districts, which meant that\r\nevery grain of food had to be laboriously carried up.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the care of 3,000 men in such a country was no light\r\nwork; and Gatacre, who never took his work lightly even at home,\r\ncertainly did not spare himself on service.  His own letters give such\r\na good idea of the routine of camp life, and of the spirit of genuine\r\npleasure in it all that was so characteristic of him, that they shall\r\ntell their own tale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We are marching all day over the most impossible ground.  Our food\r\ncomes up at about 10 o'clock at night.  Last night, owing to the\r\nbadness of the track, it never came in at all, and this morning I hear\r\nit is still four miles off, the other side of the pass: this means\r\nanother eight hours!  Talk about roads, you never saw such a country!\r\nYou approach a range of hills 10,000 ft. high, you have to cut a road\r\nfor the animals before you attempt to bring them up, and this means\r\ntime.  Every now and then they have to stop and clear away these\r\ncreatures who stalk us and shoot from behind rocks.  We have {138} been\r\nvery fortunate in losing no men, though we have knocked over a good\r\nmany of them.\"\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday we were soaked with rain twice, had difficulty about wood\r\nfor cooking, all green and soaked with wet; but everybody got in by 10\r\np.m. except about fifty mules and a company of Goorkhas who were\r\nstopped by the road falling away and some mules falling through about\r\n300 yards down the khud.  This of course stopped the remainder there\r\nfor the night, but we got them some food, and they had to bivouac the\r\nnight there without fire or blankets.  We got them on this morning.\r\n\r\n\"Is it not marvellous?  Out of my whole force of four regiments, a\r\nbattery, and a company of Sappers, I have no sick men; they march all\r\nday, making roads, constantly get wet through, often have to sleep at\r\ngreat elevations.  We were 8,700 ft. the night before last, without\r\nblankets, and yet they are all quite fit: no sick officer or man.  Of\r\ncourse we take all the care we can of them.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday after passing over the pass we found on the hills along\r\nwhich the road ran all English flowers--narcissus, iris, lilies (they\r\nplant them on their graves), may, hawthorn, hyacinths, tulips, in great\r\nprofusion.  The country is magnificent, soil very rich, would grow\r\nanything; we must take the country and improve it.  It is another\r\nKashmir.\"\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\"We had a thunderstorm with lightning last night, a grand sight.  I was\r\ncoming back from Ashreth after nightfall, and stopped several times to\r\nwatch the lightning light the snow peaks--quite beautiful!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: On the road to Chitral.]\r\n\r\n\"I had a hard day the day before yesterday.  {139} My orderly officer\r\nand I had to go from Dir to Janbatai and back, about fifty-six miles\r\nover a difficult road; we started at 5 a.m. and did not get back till 1\r\na.m. yesterday.  For we were delayed on the road so long inspecting\r\nthat night overtook us, and we had to walk along a most impossible\r\ntrack leading our ponies; we literally had to feel our way with our\r\nfeet.  We all got falls over rocks and stones, but beyond breaking our\r\nskin and clothes we were none the worse.  The river was running under\r\nus nearly all the way about 300 ft. straight down, so you may imagine\r\nwe had to be careful.  I lost my helmet, but fortunately it rolled down\r\nthe track instead of over the khudside.\"\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\"Though I get up at daybreak and go to bed at 11 p.m. daily, I assure\r\nyou that I never have a moment; it seems strange, but if you saw the\r\ncountry you would understand it.  I have a long line of troops\r\nscattered over some forty miles of country connected by a single road\r\nalong which only one man and one animal can pass at a time; sixteen\r\nbridges which may be washed away at any moment, causing many hours'\r\ndelay in replacement; a snow pass, in the centre exactly, over which\r\nevery ounce of food has to come; a terrific road along river-beds at\r\none moment, running nearly up to the sky the next; 4,000 mules and\r\ndonkeys working in stages from place to place, with supplies, guards,\r\nescorts, regiments, all of which have to be carefully watched to see\r\nthat they have food and that nothing goes wrong.  All this takes time,\r\nfor it is a country one cannot gallop in, hardly go off a walk, but we\r\nare improving the roads and cutting new ones.\"\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n{140}\r\n\r\n\"Then the snow pass stops us; we have to carry all our loads and\r\nsupplies over the pass by hand.  This makes us slow, but it is very\r\nsure; now the snow is melting and avalanches falling in every\r\ndirection.  Such an interesting country, and so beautiful!  I have\r\nnever seen such scenery, such mountains, trees, and rivers--simply\r\nmagnificent!  The spot I am now encamped in is about 2,000 ft. below\r\nthe top of the pass, covered with gigantic cedars and pine-trees, eight\r\nand nine feet in diameter; I have never seen such trees.  It is\r\nimpossible to imagine anything more beautiful.  There are high snow\r\nmountains all around us, a snow torrent from the avalanches rushing\r\nsome hundreds of feet below us, carrying trees, rocks, etc., along with\r\nit; one can hardly hear oneself speak.  Below in the valley one finds\r\nevery English flower almost, chiefly in blossom, white peonies,\r\nhoneysuckle--all sorts.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we are getting on all right.  I have been halted here for seven\r\ndays owing to want of supplies; one of our bridges broke and stopped\r\nthem.  But we are moving on to-day; this refers to the troops only--of\r\ncourse I move up and down the line every day.\r\n\r\n\"One of my officers was shot at yesterday, but up to date I have been\r\nunable to discover the man.  I always have a duffedar (Native Cavalry\r\nN.C.O.) with a carbine behind me whenever I ride, and two Goorkhas\r\nwhenever I walk; but I am out all day and most of the night, and I\r\nwonder they have not had a shot at me yet, for it is a wild country,\r\nfull of trees, stones, and jungle.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday I caught thirty drivers stealing stores from their loads.\r\nThere has been a great deal of this all along the road, causing us much\r\n{141} loss; so I had them all thrashed.  There was much howling, but I\r\ndo not think there will be any more thieving; we have to be summary\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fort]\r\n\r\nOn May 15 the Third Brigade marched into Chitral.  Sir Robert Low and\r\nthe Headquarter Staff followed a few days later; their arrival was made\r\nthe occasion for a political durbar, and a grand review of all the\r\ntroops, including the garrison of the fort, and Colonel Kelly's\r\ntriumphant little band.  Sir Robert Low made a speech in which he\r\ncomplimented all ranks on the good work that each contingent had\r\nperformed, and more particularly thanked the Third Brigade and their\r\nBrigadier for their share in the success of his expedition.\r\n\r\nAt the first opportunity Gatacre himself read the Funeral Service over\r\nthe grave where Captain Baird, who fell in the sortie of March 3, had\r\nbeen hastily buried during the siege.  He gave orders for the erection\r\nof a wooden cross, and had photographs taken of this and the country\r\nround, which he sent with a sympathetic letter to the young officer's\r\nmother.  On his arrival in England in the autumn he regarded it as one\r\nof his first duties to fulfil his promise to call on Mrs. Baird, a\r\nwidow lamenting her only son.\r\n\r\nOn the approach of the hot weather, the troops were withdrawn from the\r\nfort, and disposed in suitable camps along the road, pending the\r\ndecision of Government on the question of {142} occupation.  The long\r\nline of communications was divided into sections, the most advanced,\r\nfrom Dir northwards to Chitral, being held by the Third Brigade, the\r\nsection from Dir southwards to Janbatai by the Second, and the Swat\r\nValley by the First.  Road-making and mending was still the principal\r\noccupation, for the General was never satisfied with his roads; and all\r\nthrough the summer months the men were kept, happy, and well by\r\nimproving the roadway which is still used by the column of troops which\r\nevery two years relieves the garrison of Chitral.\r\n\r\nIt was probably at this time that the following incident took place.\r\nThe General one day passed a supply convoy on the road, in charge of a\r\ntransport officer with whose appearance he was dissatisfied, though he\r\nsaid nothing at the time.  Next day he sent for the senior officer, and\r\nafter a short talk with him told him to smarten up his subaltern.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, sir, certainly,\" said the officer, and a look of pride and\r\nrelief stole over his face that he had himself escaped unfriendly\r\ncriticism.  The General, reading the man's expression, added, \"And\r\nsmarten yourself up, too.\"\r\n\r\nThe officer who supplies this tale concludes: \"I can see and hear the\r\nGeneral's chuckle after administering this little pill.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Snipers]\r\n\r\nColonel Ronald Brooke,[3] who proved himself an orderly officer after\r\nhis General's own heart, tells us how the Ashreth Valley became\r\ninfested by a band of hillmen who cut up stragglers from {143} the\r\nconvoys, and finally one night attacked a band of Chitrali traders\r\n(under the impression that they were our transport followers) who had\r\nincautiously spent the night at the foot of the pass.  Twelve out of\r\nthirteen were killed; one only escaped, badly wounded, to carry the\r\nnews to the nearest military post.  The story goes on:\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] Brevet-Lieutenant-Colonel R. G. Brooke, D.S.O.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The General and I at once hurried to the spot, which looked just like\r\na shambles, and he immediately ordered a beat on a huge scale.  Troops\r\nsilently surrounded the Ashreth Valley from every side; and on August\r\n12, instead of a grouse drive, we indulged in the far more exciting\r\nexperience of a Kafristan robber drive.  A band of fifteen were flushed\r\non the hillside, of whom five were captured, the others escaping, never\r\nto return to so dangerous a spot.  Of the five prisoners, three were\r\nsentenced to death, and the other two were set free on account of their\r\nyouth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: General Gatacre and his favourite pony.]\r\n\r\nHaving thus cleared his own valley of snipers, Gatacre longed to do the\r\nsame on the Dir-Janbatai section, where the troops on escort-duty had\r\nbeen constantly fired on, several soldiers having been mortally\r\nwounded.  At last he secured from the Major-General Commanding\r\npermission to take over this dangerous section as well as his own.  A\r\npicked lot of Pathan Sepoys were sent down under an excellent native\r\nnon-commissioned officer, with instructions to patrol the hillsides far\r\nabove the position that snipers might take up, just when convoys {144}\r\nwere on the move, and thus literally to stalk the stalkers.  This idea\r\nwas crowned with success.  In a few days' time the Pathans spotted a\r\nparty of three hillmen lying up for the convoy.  With extraordinary\r\nskill they succeeded in capturing two of the party; the third man\r\nescaped, although so severely wounded that he was tracked by his\r\nblood-marks for nine miles.  The two prisoners turned out to be Afghans\r\nwho had come over the frontier bent on doing as much harm as possible.\r\nBoth were hanged, and thenceforward there was no more sniping on that\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nThe General's interest in the scenery and flowers was very genuine.\r\nDuring the three months that the troops were scattered in various camps\r\nin these beautiful valleys, he found time to make a large collection of\r\nflowers and ferns, and himself attended to the drying and packing of\r\nthe specimens.  When these were eventually handed over to the Forest\r\nDepartment at Calcutta, the botanists found one fern which was\r\npronounced a new variety, and named it after the General in the records\r\nof the Department.\r\n\r\nIn due course orders arrived for the withdrawal of the Relief Force.\r\nEarly in September Gatacre conducted his Brigade over the frontier, and\r\nbade them farewell amidst the heartiest expressions of affection and\r\ngoodwill on the part of all ranks, British and Native.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{145}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n1896\r\n\r\nQUETTA\r\n\r\nOn November 10, 1895, a few familiar words were read once more in a\r\nvillage church in Sussex, the old-world troth was given and plighted,\r\nand the face of the earth was changed thereby for the two persons most\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nThe General had been unable to take more than ninety days' privilege\r\nleave, and therefore had to be back in Bombay early in January.  The\r\ndrill season was already far advanced, the programme for the inspection\r\nof the various regiments in the outlying stations included in the\r\nBombay Command was already laid out, and trips to Baroda, Ahmedabad,\r\nSurat, and Cutch-Bhuj followed one another in close succession.\r\n\r\nThese trips, which made a welcome respite from the heavy office-work\r\nand town-life at Headquarters, sometimes included a day's sport and\r\nrecreation.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, February 21, the General, his staff officer, and the writer\r\ndisembarked from the S.S. _Kola_ at Mandvi, in the Gulf of Cutch.  This\r\ncoast is so shallow that the steamers have to lie a long way out, and\r\nthe process of {146} disembarkation includes transfer from the\r\nmail-boat to a steam-launch, thence to a rowing-boat, which runs\r\naground alongside some bullock-drawn waggons.  Across the highest\r\ntimbers of these carts nets are stretched, on which the passengers seat\r\nthemselves, while the final stage is a chair borne by four natives who\r\nare waist-deep in water as they cross the pools in the interminable\r\nstretch of sea and sand.  A forty-mile drive in a carriage provided by\r\nthe Rao Saheb of Cutch brought us to the capital where the 17th Bombay\r\nInfantry were then quartered.  The Resident, whose guests we were, the\r\nCommandant of the regiment, four other officers, the doctor, and four\r\nladies made up the whole British contingent.\r\n\r\nThe inspection went off without memorable incident.  The real interest\r\nof the trip lay in the native races and the pig-sticking camp, which\r\nthe Rao Saheb had arranged to fill in the blank days while waiting for\r\nthe weekly mail-boat.\r\n\r\nThe Rao Saheb was a man of about thirty, who, together with his younger\r\nbrother, Karloba, had taken kindly to English ways; they played\r\nlawn-tennis on even terms with the officers and their wives, and when\r\non horseback their costume was entirely English except for the\r\nbrilliant puggri.  The camp and all its accessories were furnished by\r\nthe hospitality of the Rao Saheb; he was our companion throughout the\r\nday, dinner alone excepted, and nothing was omitted for the comfort of\r\nhis guests.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pig-sticking]\r\n\r\nWe reached Wanoti Camp early in the {147} morning, and the seven men\r\nwho were carrying spears were soon on horseback.  The country was flat\r\nand sandy, and bare except where patches of low scrub provided\r\nexcellent cover.  A few beaters were sent forward to drive out the\r\ngame, and before long you could see some very solid-looking bodies,\r\nvery low on the ground, moving amongst the bushes at a surprising pace:\r\nthese were a \"sounder\" of pigs.  The Rao Saheb selected one, the\r\nGeneral another, and, being mounted on a capital white pony, I was\r\nclose at his heels.  This boar, which was scored to the General's\r\nspear, turned out to be the biggest of the seven which was the total\r\nfor the day.  But he was no sooner dispatched than we were off after\r\nanother.  Again the same spear was the first to touch him; then we lost\r\nsight of him as he crashed through a thick hedge.  When we emerged\r\nthrough the nearest gap we found that the Resident had picked up his\r\nline, but while taking a thrust at him the pig jinked and tripped up\r\nthe horse, so that both he and his rider rolled in the sand, while the\r\npig went off with the eight-foot spear stuck in his body like a pin in\r\na pin-cushion.  If we had not been close at hand the savage creature\r\nwould have turned and rent the fallen man, who, though unhurt, would\r\nhave been defenceless.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the beaters started on the other side of the camp, and\r\na most thrilling incident occurred.  After a chase of about two miles\r\nour pig disappeared over the edge of a forty-foot precipice, which was\r\nthe cliff-like side of a dry nullah; we had to look for a chine, and\r\n{148} after a scrambling descent found him again, rather winded, hiding\r\nin a ditch about five feet deep and six to eight feet wide.  The\r\nGeneral had broken his spear in a previous conflict, and was therefore\r\nunarmed.  There were two officers only with us, one of whom cried out,\r\n\"If you do not know how to tackle him yourself, give your spear to the\r\nGeneral, and let him try.\"\r\n\r\nHe took the proffered spear, and, handing over his pony, stepped down\r\ninto the nullah, just opposite the boar, and with the lance under his\r\nelbow stood facing the fierce creature for some four or five minutes,\r\ntill the latter suddenly rose up and plunged forward; but the spear was\r\nin readiness, the charge was stayed, and the animal fell back, run\r\nright through the throat.\r\n\r\nWhile at Bhuj the following telegram reached the General:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"From Military Secretary, Chief, Calcutta: Chief proposes to select you\r\nto officiate in command Quetta District during absence of General\r\nGalbraith proceeding on leave to England.  Please wire if agreeable to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was followed two days later by another, from Sir Charles Nairne,\r\nCommander-in-Chief Bombay Army:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I congratulate you both on going to Quetta.  You will have a wide\r\nenough field there.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout the month of March the General was kept busy with the\r\npreparation and execution of some extensive manoeuvres which took place\r\non the hills near Khandalla.  There was {149} also a Horse Show in\r\nBombay to attend to; this was on a bigger scale than had hitherto been\r\nattempted.  The General rode in several classes, and won the first\r\nprize for Arab chargers, and also for the best turn-out in the driving\r\nclasses.  The cheers that greeted him as he appeared in the\r\nprize-winners' parade were significant of the public appreciation of\r\nthe energy that, as chairman of the committee, he had thrown into the\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Leaves Bombay]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of April 7, as the General Officer Commanding sailed in\r\nthe transport _Warren Hastings_ for Karachi, _en route_ for Quetta, the\r\nnine-gun salute boomed out its farewell greeting in the summer night.\r\n\r\nThis First-class District, with its headquarters on the lofty plateau\r\nknown as Quetta, about 6,000 ft. high, was a command wholly congenial\r\nto Gatacre's temperament.  The office-work was very light; there was a\r\ngarrison of two battalions of British infantry, one regiment of Native\r\ncavalry, and two of Native infantry, besides a complement of artillery,\r\nequipped both with oxen and mules, a splendid transport train, and\r\nother details.  The outposts are on the actual frontier of the British\r\nEmpire; their very distance and inaccessibility exercised a great\r\nattraction for him, so that the official visit to each station became a\r\npicnic pleasure-party in a very literal sense.  Nothing was wanting,\r\nnot even battle, murder, and sudden death, to create that sense of\r\ndanger and adventure that casts its fascinating shadow over this wild\r\nfrontier land.\r\n\r\n{150}\r\n\r\nAs the season in which marching could be accomplished in comfort was\r\nalready advanced, and the days were fast growing hot and long, it was\r\ndecided to start very soon after our arrival on a tour of inspection to\r\nFort Sandeman, Lorelai, and other outlying posts.  Fort Sandeman lies\r\nto the north-east of Quetta, and is in the Lower Zhob Valley; it is 180\r\nmiles from Khanai station on the Quetta Railway.  A squadron of the 5th\r\nSind Horse, under Captain Sherard, furnished the escort.  No supplies\r\ncould be reckoned on by the way, so that transport had to be drawn to\r\ncarry six weeks' food for five mounted officers, their servants and\r\nhorses, and also for the hundred Sowars and their horses, and for the\r\ntransport animals themselves.  This made quite a long line of horses,\r\ncamels, and mules on the march, and one of the duties of our daily\r\nroutine was a walk down the transport lines at sunset.\r\n\r\nThere is not space here to do justice to this delightful ride.  We\r\ncovered between six and seven hundred miles in the six weeks we were\r\nout.  The early starts while the moon shone brilliantly, the long\r\nleisurely days in camp, the evening scramble over the nearest hills,\r\nand the nights passed under the clear stars, with no sound but the\r\nsteady tramp of the sentries; the puzzling alternation of sandy desert\r\nand rocky rift, dry nullahs and roaring torrents,--all make up memories\r\nof strange and delightful doings never to be spoilt, even by the\r\ncounter recollections of sun and dust.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of the same year Fort Sandeman {151} was the scene of a\r\nshocking tragedy.  A Sepoy of the 40th Pathans ran amok while on sentry\r\nduty one evening outside the officers' mess.  According to his\r\ndeposition later, he had been waiting to get all the five officers into\r\nline as they wandered round the billiard-table, so that he might strike\r\nthem all with one bullet.  But the finesse of his idea was defeated by\r\nhis own impatience; he fired his shot when only three men were covered.\r\nTwo young officers were so seriously wounded that they fell\r\nimmediately, and died a few hours later.  With great presence of mind\r\nand courage, and undismayed by a severe wound in the arm, Mr.\r\nMaclachlan gave chase to the murderer, and by raising the alarm and\r\ncalling out the guard contributed to his capture, though unfortunately\r\nthis was not effected till the tehsildar and two native clerks had been\r\nshot dead.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom to make the last afternoon of an inspection visit the\r\noccasion for a social gathering; sports and trials of skill would be\r\narranged, the native regiments would perform feats of horsemanship, and\r\norganize a display of national dancing and wrestling.  One peculiarly\r\nstriking effect was worked out by an officer in the 15th Bengal Lancers\r\nat Lorelai.  Thirty-two Sowars in their white undress uniform, mounted\r\non white or grey horses, cantered past doing sword-practice, their\r\ncurved blades flashing in the sun; but the ghostly effect of these\r\nwhite horsemen was enhanced when they were followed by another group\r\nmounted entirely on chestnuts, doing {152} lance-practice, the red and\r\nwhite pennons and scarlet cummerbunds adding to the colour scheme.\r\n\r\nLorelai also contributed its note of tragedy, for very shortly after\r\nour departure from Beluchistan, Colonel Gaisford (soldier and civilian)\r\nwas treacherously assassinated in the very dak-bungalow in which we had\r\nresided.\r\n\r\nThe object of a short tour planned for September was formally to take\r\nover a strip of land known as the Toba Plateau, which had been recently\r\nceded to the Government of India under an arrangement effected by a\r\nFrontier Delimitation Commission.  As this was a desolate land with few\r\ninhabitants, the General planned to combine this political object with\r\nmilitary training in the way of practice in field-firing.  He arranged\r\nthat detachments of the 1st Bombay Grenadiers and of the 26th Beluchis\r\nshould take part in the manoeuvres, and that the 25th Bombay Rifles\r\nshould meet him at the camping-ground.  It was the first time a white\r\nman had been seen in the country.  The march abounded with picturesque\r\nand amusing incidents.  For instance, there was the day when the camel\r\ntransport lost their way.  Their pace being a little slower than that\r\nof the mules, and the country that day with its low round sandhills\r\nbeing peculiarly puzzling, they lost touch with the tail of the column.\r\nA transport duffedar was sent back to look for the string of camels,\r\nbut came not again; a corporal was sent on a mule to look for the\r\nduffedar, and he came not again.  It was now getting late, and darkness\r\nwould soon fall, so the {153} General himself started on a pony to look\r\nfor the corporal.  It was six o'clock before the camels, who were\r\ncarrying our tents, mess kit, and clothing, reached the camp, from a\r\npoint exactly opposite to the direction whence they were expected.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Field-firing]\r\n\r\nWhen the rendezvous on Toba Plateau was reached, after about three\r\ndays' march from Chaman, we settled down for a week, and field-firing\r\nin the miniature valleys took place daily.  The day before the proposed\r\nattack newspapers are spread out with the help of stones in the\r\npositions where tribesmen defending their homes would be likely to\r\nerect sangars and make a stand.  The attacking column, being supplied\r\nwith ball cartridges, shoot at these targets till they disappear, and\r\nthen advance till a bend of the valley discloses another imaginary\r\nconcentration of the enemy.  This device presents a very realistic\r\ncounterfeit of hill warfare.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me now that all our time at Quetta was spent in such mimic\r\nfighting.  The wild and desolate country, in which the cantonments lay\r\nlike an oasis, lent itself admirably to military training; the\r\ngarrison, complete in all its units, provided the necessary troops of\r\nall arms, so that a succession of field-officers were sent up for\r\ntactical examination, the practical side of which meant a series of\r\nfield-days.  The General's A.D.C., when called upon for reminiscences,\r\nsends the following anecdote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"His good temper and quiet way of rebuking people was, I have always\r\nthought, remarkable.  {154} I remember a field-day when an officer had\r\ngot a company in a very badly chosen spot.  The General, in his usual\r\ninnocent sort of way, went up to him to gather, as it were,\r\ninformation.  He always did that: he looked as if he was dying to\r\nlearn, while really he was leading on the man to talk and show what he\r\nknew, or else to convict him out of his own mouth.  The Major had no\r\ngood reason for his dispositions, and when cornered began to quote the\r\ndrill-book.  The General quietly said: 'It's not very good form to\r\nthrow the drill-book at your General.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a similar occasion, at an outpost parade, the captain in charge of\r\nthe picquet was unaccountably nervous, and had great difficulty in\r\nexplaining the \"idea.\"  With two words the General put him out of his\r\npain and signalised his incompetence: \"You're shot,\" he said.  \"Who is\r\nnext in command?\"\r\n\r\nOn the Sind-Pishin Railway, as the branch line is called that runs from\r\nRuk Junction on the Indus through Quetta and on to Chaman, there is\r\nonly one train in each direction in the twenty-four hours.  The\r\nrailroad runs for miles over the wildest and most desolate tracts.  It\r\nis 150 miles from Quetta to Sibi, and Sibi is 100 miles north of\r\nJacobabad.  The roadside stations consist merely of a few planks as\r\nplatform, a hut for the station-master, who is commonly an Eurasian,\r\nand a standpipe; sometimes there is a second hut, in which a bunnia\r\ndoes business in food-stuffs and other simple trading.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A massacre]\r\n\r\nSunari Station, lying about 100 miles east of Quetta, must have been a\r\nplace of slightly more {155} importance, for when the Marris fell upon\r\nit they found fifteen persons to murder.  Unfortunately for him, a\r\nEuropean youth, named Canning, a sub-inspector of the line, and son of\r\nthe station-master at Sibi, happened to be there that fatal morning.\r\nAs the daily train approached the station between 9 and 10 a.m., the\r\nengine-driver was puzzled at not receiving the customary greeting on\r\nthe signals, but decided to crawl on carefully into the station.  It\r\nwas only too clear that a wholesale slaughter with swords had been\r\nperpetrated; the place was strewn with dead bodies, terribly slashed\r\nabout, and the bunnia's shop had been set on fire.  The terrified\r\ndriver and guard found the station-master with his arm cut off, but\r\nstill breathing, and carefully laid him on the train, but even this\r\nsole survivor of this unparalleled outrage died before the next station\r\nwas reached.  In the meantime the pointsman had fled on foot to the\r\nnext station, and telegraphed the startling news from there to Quetta.\r\n\r\nVery shortly after the arrival of the news the telegraph wires were\r\nfound to be cut; to imaginative minds a rising of the whole powerful\r\ntribe of Marris was imminent.  The railroad, which ran for miles\r\nthrough the Marris' country, might be destroyed, the telegraph lines\r\nwere already severed, all communication with India would thus be cut\r\noff, and Quetta isolated might have added another picturesque story to\r\nthe romantic series of frontier annals.\r\n\r\nVery naturally a panic took place at the {156} adjoining\r\nrailway-stations, some of the station-masters actually constructing\r\namateur wire entanglements with the telegraph stores.  A new staff was\r\nestablished at Sunari with a strong guard, and detachments of the 25th\r\nBombay Rifles were posted all along the line.  The Political Department\r\noffered the very handsome reward of 2,500 rupees for the capture of the\r\nthree ringleaders, and Gatacre, who had been on short leave at Simla,\r\nhurried back to take a hand in the search.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of October 23 the following letter was sent back\r\nto Quetta:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To-day I am going out with some of the Pathans to look over the ground\r\nwhere we hear some of these men have been, possibly are now.  I do not\r\nthink we shall get back to-night, as the ground is said to be very bad,\r\nbut we have taken our blankets and some food.  I should much like to\r\ncatch these Ghazis; it would be highly satisfactory.  The Marris\r\npromise Gaisford much, but I think they are humbugging him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe party left Dalujal Station at 5.30 a.m.  The troops were drawn from\r\nthe 24th Beluchistan Regiment.  At nightfall they bivouacked near Dirgi\r\nSprings; and next morning, with a view to scouring the hills, the party\r\nwas divided into four groups.  Besides the General there were two\r\nBritish officers, two Native officers, and forty-four Pathans.  One\r\nBritish officer was allotted to each party, and a subadar took charge\r\nof the fourth; the rendezvous was to be a well-marked peak in the range\r\nin front of them.  {157} The General, with five Sepoys and a Marri whom\r\nhe had impressed as guide, took a middle line and made straight for the\r\nsummit, instructing the other parties to take a wider sweep.  He had\r\nregarded this peak as a likely place, because he had heard that there\r\nwas a musjid or small shrine built there, to which the murderers might\r\nhave resorted for purification after contact with the Feringhi.\r\n\r\nAs the handful of men crept up the rocky slope a sangar came into view,\r\nwhich was suggestive.  The leading Pathan signalled with his hand that\r\nall should go silently, and crouch; a few more yards were covered in\r\nthis way, and then the sangar was rushed.  The Sepoys flung themselves\r\nupon the two men who were found sleeping behind the rocks with such\r\nsplendid dash that they all rolled together as the enemy made frantic\r\nefforts to get at their knives.  But no one was hurt, and in an instant\r\nthe prisoners were securely bound with the puggris of their captors.\r\n\r\nThe other search-parties now appeared on the scene, and very soon\r\ndiscovered the third Ghazi, who, being also asleep in fancied security,\r\nhad no chance to get away.  Three others, who had been sent away to\r\ndraw water, were now seen approaching, but they turned and fled.  The\r\nnature of the ground made it impossible to follow them on their own\r\nmountains with any chance of success.\r\n\r\nAt noon the little force started back.  On this return journey the\r\nGeneral shifted his position from leading to bringing up the rear;\r\n{158} for he anticipated that a stampede might be made on the part of\r\nthe prisoners with the intention of knocking him down the khud, while\r\nin the scuffle and panic they would hope to effect their escape.  This\r\nreasoned caution in protecting his life against obvious and purposeless\r\ndangers was as habitual and spontaneous with the General as was his\r\nforwardness in disregarding the risks when occasion demanded.  He was\r\npunctilious in protecting himself against sunstroke, and wore a pad\r\ndown his spine as well as the universal topee, and by such personal\r\nheedfulness safeguarded his life and general health.\r\n\r\nHowever, on this particular occasion his precaution nearly proved\r\ndisastrous.  As the string of men crept down the mountain-side a\r\njemadar noticed that one of the Sepoys had failed to uncock his rifle,\r\nand gave the necessary order.  A shot rang out.  The General's helmet\r\nwas blown off his head, and was picked up blackened with the smoke of\r\nthe charge.  He is said to have smiled, as he rescued the Sepoy from\r\nthe jemadar's wrath and secured the empty cartridge as a memento.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Beluchi murderers.]\r\n\r\nWhen the party reached Sunari Station, after a march of seventeen\r\nmiles, the General discovered that there was no political officer there\r\nto whom he could hand over the prisoners, so that there was no choice\r\nbut to march another six miles to Dalujal.  Here the murderers were\r\ntaken over by the Civil Department.  The irons with which they were\r\nimmediately loaded seemed fantastically medieval in their weight {159}\r\nand simplicity.  But on the other hand, nothing could have been more\r\nfantastic than the proceedings of the Englishman who had effected their\r\ncapture.  This was the view taken by Sir George White, the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, though he little guessed when he wrote how very\r\nnearly his words had come true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I congratulate you on the way in which you managed and executed the\r\ncapture.  I am also very glad to know we have General Officers\r\ncommanding first-class districts who take to the hills for amusement,\r\nbut I must also say that I don't think the job was quite one for the\r\nG.O.C. to conduct personally.  If they had managed to get a bullet into\r\nyou it would have made the affair one of very sinister importance.\r\nHowever, from that point of view, 'all is well that ends well.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A death sentence]\r\n\r\nA few days later the headmen of the Marri tribe handed over the other\r\nthree men implicated, and at Sibi, on November 2, the three Ghazis,\r\nFakir Kala Khan, Jalamb, and Rahim Ali, atoned for their misdeeds.  The\r\nsentence was death by hanging followed by public cremation.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Compare _Beluchistan Gazette_, October 29, November 5, 1896, and\r\n_Civil and Military Gazette_, November 12, 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the return of the troops to Quetta great excitement prevailed when,\r\nthrough the presence of a strong guard at the station, it became known\r\nthat the promised treasure was on the same train.  Of course this was\r\ndivided amongst the Sepoys only; all those who went to the mountain had\r\na share, with extra money to those {160} who actually took a hand in\r\nthe fray.  It was evening when the train came in, so that it was not\r\ntill we reached the house that I noticed the blackened helmet, and saw\r\nthe rent cut by the bullet.  When called upon for an explanation, the\r\nemotion of that moment took possession of him again: it was the only\r\ntime that I heard his voice break.\r\n\r\nThroughout that summer Mr. Curry and the railway engineers had been\r\nbusy over the new railroad that was to connect Sibi and Quetta via the\r\nBolan Pass.  This line is shorter than the Hurnai route by fifty miles,\r\nbut it had hitherto presented insuperable difficulties to the engineer.\r\nTwo previous attempts had been made; but the floods rise so high in the\r\ngorges and had twice so completely wrecked the permanent way, that this\r\nroute had been discarded by Sir James Browne, who preferred to tackle\r\nthe Chupper Rift with his magnificent suspension bridge.  But owing to\r\nthe unreliability of the shifting sands at Mud Gorge it was imperative\r\nfor military purposes to have an alternative line.  The new\r\nBolan-Mushkaf railroad was completed in November 1896.  To give the\r\nGeneral an opportunity of seeing this triumph of construction, Mr.\r\nCurry decided to initiate the new service on the day of our departure\r\nfrom Quetta.  The eight months' acting appointment reached its\r\nconclusion on November 30, 1896, and the first mail train left Quetta\r\nfor Sibi on that day at 10 a.m., carrying Gatacre back to resume his\r\nsubstantive appointment at Bombay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{161}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n1897\r\n\r\nTHE PLAGUE\r\n\r\nIn the Report issued by the Bombay Plague Committee of 1897 it is shown\r\nthat 27,597 persons died of that disease between August 8, 1896, and\r\nJune 30, 1897; while the total mortality from all causes for the same\r\nperiod was 45,886.  This is more than one-twentieth of the normal\r\naverage population given as 850,000.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See Chart 3, issued with the _Report on the Bubonic Plague_, by\r\nBrigadier-General W. F. Gatacre, C.B., D.S.O., 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the disease first declared itself, the Press and its volunteer\r\ncorrespondents showed extraordinary ingenuity in denying its existence,\r\nin attempting to discount the seriousness of the situation and\r\ninventing euphemisms by which to describe the \"glandular fever.\"  But\r\nthe authorities responsible for the health of the city appreciated the\r\ngravity of the prospect.  The Municipality appointed a special\r\nsub-committee to investigate the causes of the epidemic and to carry\r\nout measures for its suppression; and Mr. Haffkine, the bacteriologist,\r\nwas requisitioned from Calcutta to identify the bacillus.  By the {162}\r\nend of October the accommodation available in the Municipal Hospital\r\nfor infectious diseases was lamentably inadequate.  Customs officers in\r\nforeign ports took alarm and imposed quarantine on all vessels from\r\nBombay Port.  Natives of all classes were terror-stricken, and many\r\nfamilies fled up-country.  Thousands daily streamed over the two\r\ncauseways that connect the Island of Bombay with the mainland; vast\r\ncrowds assembled at the Bunders and the railway-stations in their haste\r\nto get away by sea and rail.  Before January was out, half the\r\ninhabitants had escaped, for it has been shown that the population fell\r\nfrom 797,000 on December 8 to 437,000 on February 8.  At the same time\r\nthe mortality reached alarming figures, showing 4,559 in December and\r\n6,189 in January in excess of the normal death-rate duly corrected.\r\nAlthough January is the coolest and pleasantest month of the year, it\r\nproved the most disastrous; the outbreak reached its climax on the 15th\r\nand 16th, on which days 344 and 345 fatal attacks were recorded.\r\n\r\nThe fires that burn inside the high walls that bound the Charni Road\r\nsent up a thicker smoke and a more suggestive stench than ever before.\r\nThe price of wood for funeral pyres went up; in some cases Hindus\r\nconsented to bury their dead, because they could not afford to buy the\r\nnecessary timber.  On January 18, 1897, an article appeared in _The\r\nTimes of India_ seriously discussing the supply of vultures then\r\ninhabiting the Towers of Silence.  The writer concludes {163} with the\r\nquaint phrase: \"There are now nearly 400, the number being ample, even\r\nwith the high death-rate now existing in the Parsee Community.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hindu burning-ghat]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe General Officer Commanding was fully alive to the dangerous and\r\ninsanitary condition of some of the older parts of the town.  For the\r\ngreater security of his household he took an airy house on Malabar\r\nHill, instead of inhabiting the official residence in the Marine Lines.\r\nHe further arranged for the Marine Battalion, which forms the permanent\r\ngarrison of Bombay, to leave their antiquated huts in the same road and\r\ngo out under canvas.  Two English ladies living in the Marine Lines\r\ncaught the plague, but fortunately both recovered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A white man dies]\r\n\r\nThe European colony were profoundly distressed on hearing of the death\r\nof Surgeon-Major Robert Manser on January 6, 1897.  He was First\r\nPhysician of the Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy Hospital, and Professor at the\r\nGrant Medical College.  It was said at first that pneumonia was the\r\ncause; but when Nurse Joyce, who had been attending him, died on the\r\nfollowing day, suspicions were aroused, and the bacteriological\r\nexamination established the connection between plague and pneumonia.\r\n\r\nEarly in February, under a pseudonym, the General published two\r\ncarefully reasoned and suggestive articles in _The Times of India_.  In\r\nthe first he pointed put that the existence of the plague and the\r\nconsequent exodus of the {164} population afforded an excellent\r\nopportunity of carrying out extensive improvements in the housing and\r\nsanitation of the worst parts of the city, and in acquiring official\r\ncontrol over the disposal of the dead.  In the second he called\r\nattention to the inadequacy of the hospital accommodation to meet even\r\nthe present demand, and boldly handles the question of finance, saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What is a lakh or ten lakhs of rupees where the prosperity of Bombay\r\nis concerned?  The question is not one for Bombay to haggle over.  The\r\nplague has become a thing of Imperial importance, Her Majesty takes a\r\ndeep interest in it, and the necessary funds must be found.  But the\r\nGovernment of India will want to see some exhaustive efforts on our\r\npart; they will expect an amount of thoroughness in combating the\r\ndisease which up to the present we have not shown.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this appeal the writer goes on to suggest that a hospital should\r\nbe established in Government House, Parel, a large mansion which had\r\nbeen the Governor's residence in the time of Sir James Fergusson, and\r\nhad since been discarded in favour of a more breezy site on Malabar\r\nPoint.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Official thanks]\r\n\r\nThe municipality took the hint and voted funds.  Lord Sandhurst\r\nresponded readily and offered his \"country seat\" for the purposes of a\r\nSpecial Plague Hospital, and the General came forward officially, and\r\npromised to see to the equipment of the wards, and to provide doctors,\r\norderlies, attendants, etc., from the troops under his command.  His\r\ncall for volunteers met with {165} the same ready response; for nurses\r\nhe applied to the various Roman Catholic Convents in the neighbourhood;\r\nand expended a special donation from Lady Sandhurst in making the\r\nSisters' quarters as comfortable as possible, and in fitting up a\r\nlittle Oratory for them.  In ten days 150 beds were ready, and by the\r\nerection of matting huts in the large compound accommodation could be\r\nquickly provided for several hundred more.\r\n\r\nThe following paragraphs, taken from a letter from the Government of\r\nBombay to the Government of India, dated February 23, 1897, foreshadow\r\nthe policy which was adopted a few days later:\r\n\r\n\"3.  To General Gatacre the thanks of His Excellency the Governor in\r\nCouncil are in a special degree due, both for the offer of assistance\r\nand for the energy he has thrown into the undertaking.  He has spared\r\nhimself no trouble, and the result will be an unquestionable benefit to\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\n\"5.  I may add that His Excellency the Governor in Council anticipates\r\ngreat indirect benefit from a measure which brings the Military in\r\ntouch with the Civil authorities in organising measures for preventing\r\nthe spread of the plague, for it is not improbable that the Civil\r\nauthorities may before long be driven to seek considerable assistance\r\nat the hands of the Military.\"[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] Government Orders: General Department No. 1481/934 P. Bombay\r\nCastle, March 16, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the Governor regarded the situation as one which\r\ncalled for combined effort and extraordinary measures.  He also {166}\r\nrealised that if such an undertaking as stamping out the plague before\r\nthe monsoon broke was to have any chance of success, there must be\r\ncentral control and central responsibility.  He wanted a man endowed\r\nequally with the administrative capacity to conceive a comprehensive\r\nplan of action, and the executive sagacity to carry it out with success.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Gatacre Committee]\r\n\r\nLord Sandhurst, having decided to execute what amounted to a \"coup\" in\r\nits startling supersession of all the traditions of the civil,\r\nmunicipal, and military services, sent for Gatacre as the strongest man\r\nwhose services he could command, asked him to name his own committee,\r\nand to frame in his own words the instructions under which he was to\r\nact, and the powers with which he was to be invested.  There can be no\r\ndoubt that the Governor himself contributed enormously to the good\r\nresults achieved by the Plague Committee by the splendid freedom from\r\ncontrol which he allowed its Chairman, and the manner in which he put\r\nevery department of Government--civil and municipal--at his disposal,\r\nand then let him work out his own system unhampered by any question of\r\ncustom or finance.\r\n\r\nGatacre realised to the full that he was making himself personally\r\nresponsible for the success of the undertaking.  In a confidential\r\nletter he writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Government of Bombay has given me its thanks, and I have been\r\nappointed chairman {167} of the committee to stamp out the plague.\r\nLord Sandhurst sent for me, and asked me whom I would like to assist\r\nme, and I took Snow, Municipal Commissioner--he is the head of an\r\nenormous department and controls the municipality, which thus falls\r\nunder me--James, an executive engineer of the municipality, an\r\nenergetic man with an enormous staff of engineers and workmen--Dr.\r\nDimmock, who is a sound man and has energy.  I have made Cahusac\r\nsecretary.  I have been told that money is no object, but that I am to\r\nstamp out the plague.  They have passed an Act directing all to carry\r\nout _any order_ I like to issue, so if I fail it will be my own fault;\r\nbut I do not intend to fail.  We shall have much opposition, as this\r\ngives me powers over all except the Governor and his Councillors.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\"I wish they had handed me over this business in December, when I first\r\ncame down; it would never have got out of Bombay.  It has now become a\r\nmost serious question, and has extended to the whole of India.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have to thank Dr. Dimmock[3] for an account of the first meeting of\r\nthe Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] Lieut.-Colonel H. P. Dimmock, M.D., I.M.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We began at once to decide on sites for plague hospitals.  One\r\nquestion that was asked was, What sort of disease was plague?  In those\r\ndays one knew very little about it, for the bacillus had not been\r\ndiscovered.  I tried to explain as much as was known, and finished my\r\nremarks with words to the effect that whatever the special infection\r\nmight be, it seemed to be deadly and certainly contagious, and that we\r\nneed none of us expect 'to come out alive.'  'Well,' said the {168}\r\nGeneral, with a smile, 'we can't think about that; we've only got to\r\nstop it, so let's get to work.'\r\n\r\n\"One must consider that at the time plague was such an appalling and\r\nmysterious disease that even the doctors feared for their lives each\r\nday, though it was their business to face it.  How much more awful the\r\ninvisible foe must have seemed to a layman, and still more to one who\r\nhad to lead the attack on it as he did most cheerfully and\r\nenergetically without experience of the ways of infectious diseases!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first step was to surround the city with a cordon to put a stop to\r\nthe spread of the infection up-country.  This could be the more easily\r\nand effectually carried out because Bombay City is built on an island.\r\nA police guard was posted on the Sion and the Mahim Causeways, where\r\nthe road is carried over the water by long bridges, and at a ford\r\navailable at low water; a foot-track along the main water-supply was\r\nboarded up; and the two railway-stations and all the Bunders were\r\nwatched by inspection parties.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Special hospitals]\r\n\r\nWithin the city the principle was laid down that all persons suffering\r\nfrom the plague must be brought into hospital.  This involved two\r\ndepartments of labour; the first was to provide hospital accommodation,\r\nthe second to enforce the handing over of the patients.\r\n\r\nTo meet one of the manifold objections put forward by the population to\r\nthe use of hospitals, a system was started by which each community\r\nshould have its own building or camp.  This disposed of many\r\ninsuperable difficulties as to {169} the attendance on the sick, the\r\npreparation of food, etc.; and so much did this concession to their\r\npeculiar prejudices please the more enlightened communities, that their\r\nleaders came in person to the General and offered to run hospitals for\r\ntheir respective brotherhoods at their own expense.  Such offers were\r\nwillingly accepted, but control over these locations was rigidly\r\nmaintained in the hands of the Committee.  Indeed, so rapid was this\r\ndemand for special accommodation for each sect, that--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A scheme of hospital organisation was designed, a special equipment of\r\nstaff, stores, furniture, and appliances being drawn on a ready basis,\r\nsuitable to any pressing demands....  So that on an order being issued\r\nby the Committee for the institution of a hospital of any proportion,\r\nthe District Medical Officer had merely to follow the orders laid down\r\nfor a hospital of the size indicated....  Copies of the plan and\r\nequipment of a one-section hospital (twenty beds) was accordingly\r\nissued to the various executive departments of the Committee, and to\r\nall contractors, with directions to regulate the constructions of\r\nbuildings and the supply of stores, medicines, and furniture\r\naccordingly.\"[4]\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] _Report_, p. 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin one month of its creation the Committee were running forty-three\r\nhospitals, of which fifteen were Government and twenty-eight were\r\nspecial private institutions such as have been described.  In every\r\ndetail of the internal management of these private {170} institutions\r\nthe will of the Dictator prevailed.  He was always a welcome visitor;\r\nhe took the keenest interest in the symptoms as they developed in any\r\nexceptional cases, and he made sure that those peculiarly Christian\r\nprinciples should be upheld which decree that there should be no\r\ndistinction of caste in any one \"jamat,\" no difference made between\r\nhigh and low, rich and poor, and that all the sick should receive equal\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nBut it was one thing to provide model buildings and the best of\r\nattendance, and another to persuade the relatives of the sick to bring\r\nin the patients.  At the same time the segregation of the sick was the\r\nbasis of the whole policy, and it was to secure this end that the\r\nhouse-to-house visitation was instituted.\r\n\r\nWhile the mere idea of such a thing inflamed the minds of the writers\r\nin the Native Press, in practice the people soon found out that every\r\nconsideration was shown.  An appeal was made to the native gentlemen\r\nwho were Justices of the Peace to attend at such visitations, and this\r\nhad an excellent effect.  White men did not enter the houses unless\r\nopposition was made; in the street a small body of troops was employed\r\nas a show of authority, but these were mostly drawn from the Native\r\nregiments.  In no case was violence needed; the only pressure used was\r\nthe personal presence of the General, the force of his will and\r\ncharacter, the persuasion of his words uttered in their own tongue; the\r\npeople grew to have faith in his promises, to {171} appreciate his\r\ndevotion to their interests, and to respect his methods.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Drives the brake]\r\n\r\nThe Fire Brigade brake was commandeered to carry the search-parties.\r\nThe rendezvous was at daybreak; every one had to be punctual, for the\r\nGeneral waited for no one.  The Committee was accompanied by officials\r\nwith special knowledge of the quarter to be visited, and there were\r\nalways a few lady-doctors present.\r\n\r\nSupplies were taken in tiffin-baskets, but, says Dr. Dimmock, \"the\r\nGeneral's spare diet was a subject of wondering comment; some bread and\r\ndried fruit and a bottle of soda water was his usual breakfast, and his\r\nuntiring energy on such diet was marvellous.\"\r\n\r\nThe General himself drove the brake, and one or other of the Plague\r\nCommittee staff would sit on the box in order to give him an\r\nopportunity of discussing urgent matters.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion in April such a search-party was organised for an\r\nessentially Mahommedan quarter, where some opposition might be\r\nexpected.  The locality was occupied by Memons, Sunni Mahommedans, and\r\nopulent merchants hailing from Cutch.  The usual military precautions\r\nwere taken, and house-to-house visitation was in full swing.  In a\r\nfive-storied building in Kambekar Street occupied by rich Memons a\r\nplague case was discovered on the third floor.  The patient was a Memon\r\nboy aged twenty, belonging to the rich family of Noorani, who were also\r\nthe \"Patels of the Moholla,\" _i.e._ leaders of the neighbourhood.  The\r\nusual {172} certificate was made out, in the name of the patient, Haji\r\nAyub Haji Abdul Rahim Noorani, by the sub-divisional medical officer,\r\nand the family were informed that the young man would be removed to the\r\nhospital.  To this they objected, and already a sullen crowd had\r\nassembled outside.  In Mahommedan quarters the crowd is essentially\r\nmale, with an admixture of children; the women, being \"Purdah Nashins,\"\r\ndo not show themselves.\r\n\r\nOn being informed of the trouble, the General, who was a little farther\r\nup the street, immediately repaired to the spot, speaking conciliatory\r\nwords to the crowd as he made his way to the third floor and entered\r\nthe room.  Here he selected the oldest member of the family and \"very\r\ncourteously\" discussed with him the necessity for the removal of the\r\nyouth to hospital.  In the meantime the new hand ambulance (which was a\r\nlitter on a pair of bicycle wheels, worked out on an idea of the\r\nGeneral's) reached the door; but the sight of it upset the parents so\r\nmuch that they withdrew their reluctant consent to Haji's removal.\r\nRecollecting that he was dealing with a wealthy family, the General\r\nsuggested that they should send for one of their own carriages.\r\nImpervious to any notions of infection, but highly conscious of their\r\nlocal standing, the family readily consented to this compromise.\r\nHaving won his point, the General made his way down to the street,\r\nwhere the crowd was now very dense: he whispered to a native inspector,\r\nslipping a few rupees into his {173} hand.  In a few minutes there was\r\na vast scramble for sweets which were flying in every direction; under\r\ncover of this bombardment the patient was successfully carried off in\r\nan English brougham drawn by richly caparisoned white horses.[5]\r\n\r\n\r\n[5] Recollections furnished by Mr. Louis Godniho, Deputy Officer; see\r\nalso _Advocate of India_, April 3, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Seedee king]\r\n\r\nOn another occasion the quarter known as Kazipura was selected for the\r\nmorning's search work.  Kazipura is inhabited by all classes of\r\nMahommedans, including the African Negroes or Seedees.  On the arrival\r\nof the brake the party broke up and entered various dwellings.  One\r\nparty, consisting of two members of the Committee and Dr. Sorab\r\nHormusjee (to whom I am indebted for this story, and who held the\r\nappointment of Lady Assistant to the Health Officer), came across a\r\nSeedee boy aged eighteen years, whom they declared to be suffering from\r\nthe plague.  The mother denied this, saying her son was only tired,\r\nhaving been dancing all night, and, supported by some male relatives,\r\nangrily asserted that she would not allow his removal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: House-to=house visitation.]\r\n\r\nWithin a few minutes the streets and alleys were swarming with Seedees\r\narmed with sticks, and a serious riot seemed inevitable.  But\r\nfortunately the Chairman was on the spot; he instructed Mr. Vincent,\r\nthe Police Commissioner, to send for the Seedee King Makanda.  The\r\narrival of the Great Man and his Queen Sophie had a magic effect; a few\r\nwords of explanation {174} from the Chairman, a few words from the King\r\nto the sick man's mother, won the day for the cause of law and order.\r\n\r\nThe third story that I have selected is told by Miss Remy, a nursing\r\nsister of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem.  As her contribution\r\ndescribes the horrible dens that were daily visited I give her\r\nrecollections in her own words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When plague broke out in Bombay I gave up my post for a time (as\r\nMatron of a Maternity Hospital attached to a College School) and was\r\nselected by the Plague Committee to organise and take charge of the\r\nGrant Road Hospital till such time as the Roman Catholic Sisters of the\r\nOrder of Jesus and Mary were able to take up the work as they had\r\npromised.  From this hospital--the Police Hospital, where I afterwards\r\nworked--I was taken out on several occasions by the Plague Committee in\r\ntheir house-to-house visitation.  The people have strong prejudices\r\nagainst natives of another caste, and especially Europeans, approaching\r\ntoo near their places, so that in examining the houses it was necessary\r\nto respect the feelings of the owners in this regard.  The rooms are\r\nusually 10 ft. by 10 ft.; the floor sometimes is of clay beaten down\r\ntill it is firm and smooth and covered with a layer of liquid cow-dung,\r\nwhich quickly dries, forming a clean and neat surface; this is renewed\r\nat short intervals of a week or so.  The internal arrangements are very\r\nsimple; the cooking-place, usually surrounded by shining brass and\r\ncopper pots, occupies a corner of the room, a low charpoy or cot in\r\nanother, bundles of firewood, cow-dung cakes used as fuel, are stocked\r\nin odd recesses with a collection of dried fish and grain.  General\r\n{175} Gatacre, always courteous and tactful, was most careful in\r\nobserving their prejudices.  He always asked me to go in first and\r\nreport if any of the occupants were suffering from plague or other\r\ncauses, and also as to the condition of their room.  The General would\r\nfollow closely, and as the door opened to admit me he would look into\r\nthe room.  If it was particularly clean and cared-for, he invariably\r\nrewarded the occupants with a rupee or so as encouragement.  He was\r\nquick to see things, patient with details, and possessed of a tact and\r\neloquence which smoothed over many difficulties that came in the way of\r\nour work.  He was particularly fond of little children, and I have\r\noften seen him pat their heads and slip some coppers into their hands\r\nas we went along visiting the different tenements.  One incident I\r\nremember very well.  On leaving the neighbourhood of Ripon Road, after\r\nvisiting a long row of _chawls_, we were followed by a crowd of\r\nchildren, about fifty or more.  Suddenly on turning a corner we came\r\nupon a sweet shop.  The General went up to the stall and, to the utter\r\namazement and indignation of the owner, seized several trays of the\r\nsweets and scattered them on the pavement, when there was a general\r\nscramble and loud hurrahs.  Before the man could remonstrate Sir\r\nWilliam took a handful of loose silver from his pocket and placed it on\r\nthe counter.  This more than compensated the man for the sweets, and he\r\nsmiled and salaamed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring this systematic visitation hovels were discovered where white\r\nmen had never before penetrated; scores of houses were boarded up and\r\nlabelled \"U.H.H.,\" which stood for \"Unfit for human habitation.\"\r\n\r\n{176}\r\n\r\nIn _The Times of India_ of March 31, 1897, we have a graphic but, alas!\r\nlengthy account of the visit of the Committee to a Mahommedan quarter\r\nto sanction buildings selected for use as hospitals.  We read: \"When\r\nthe General's brake was sighted they lustily cheered him.\"  On this\r\noccasion a feast and a vote of thanks was part of the programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Tea and coffee were provided by the members of the party.  When all\r\nwere seated, Khan Bahadur Cassum Mitha rose and said in Hindustani:\r\n\r\n\"'General Gatacre,--We have been much honoured by your visit to this\r\nplace to-day.  Since you have assumed the command of affairs relating\r\nto this dire pestilence, we have learnt to assure ourselves of our\r\nsafety.  We are convinced that you honour our religious feelings, and\r\nwe believe that what you do is for our own good.  You have perhaps no\r\nidea of the esteem and respect you command among us.  You have won over\r\nour hearts by your noble demeanour, and on the altar of your popularity\r\nwe are ready to sacrifice everything....  In you, General, we find a\r\nsaviour, and we thank Lord Sandhurst for sending you among us.  You may\r\ncount on our assistance at any and every moment.  Our lives and our\r\nmoney will be always at your command.'\"[6]\r\n\r\n\r\n[6] See _Bombay Gazette_, March 31, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opposition]\r\n\r\nAs if in protest against the compliance of the great majority to the\r\nwishes of Government, one sect of Mahommedans, the Sunnis, showed\r\nthemselves very refractory.  After much elaborate {177} letter-writing\r\nthe Headmen sent a Mr. Raikes to lay before the Plague Committee the\r\nobjections to their proceedings.  At the conference that was arranged\r\nthe delegate was heckled into expressing himself clearly: \"'It really\r\ncomes to this,' he said; 'they ask you to minimise as far as you\r\npossibly can the great objections they have to the removal of the sick\r\nby not doing it at all.'\"[7]  To which the Chairman seems to have\r\nrapped out: \"That is absolute nonsense!\"--to the great amusement of his\r\nsupporters.  But though his words were pointed, his conduct was\r\ndeliberate, and his patience faultless, for in a leading article we\r\nread:\r\n\r\n\r\n[7] See _Advocate of India_, March 31, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The correspondence between General Gatacre and the representatives of\r\nthe Sunni Mahommedans will satisfy every one that the community has\r\nbeen treated with extraordinary patience.  The Chairman of the\r\nCommittee has given two long interviews to the Sunni leaders, who have\r\nhad professional assistance in placing their views before him.  He has\r\nlistened patiently and respectfully to every argument and objection\r\nthat has been put before him; they have gone to the Governor with a\r\nletter which put their case at its strongest; and once again they have\r\ngone back to General Gatacre, who once more, in replying to their\r\nsolicitors, treats them with a kindness and a consideration which sheer\r\nstubbornness seldom meets with in this world.\"[8]\r\n\r\n\r\n[8] See _Times of India_, April 7, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe show of troops was slightly increased {178} when the recalcitrant\r\nquarter was visited, but this precaution had due effect, and no\r\nviolence took place.\r\n\r\nAfter about six weeks of unsparing toil and incredible devotion, it was\r\nbecoming clear that the labours of all those concerned were not in\r\nvain: the returns were showing a steady and unmistakable decline.  But\r\nthis had not been accomplished without very great persistence on every\r\nside.  The General writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I hope I shall hold out all right, but the strain is pretty severe;\r\nsome of my Committee are feeling it, but have not broken down yet.  We\r\nare working from fourteen to eighteen hours in the day, which does not\r\ngive me much time for writing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThat he won the loyal support of all his colleagues is clear from the\r\nfollowing letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"... The General is keeping very well; the amount of work he gets\r\nthrough is tremendous.  There is one thing about him that has struck me\r\nvery much, and that is the extraordinary personal influence he quite\r\nunconsciously exerts over the men working under him.  A Surgeon-Colonel\r\nH---- has been sent down from Chitral for plague duty here, and he\r\ndislikes the whole thing.  He had congenial work up there, a lovely\r\nclimate, snow and frost, a nice house with a lovely garden; and he has\r\ncome down to work in the slums of Bombay at the hottest time of the\r\nyear, with no friends in the place, and a most enervating climate.  He\r\nsays that if any one else but General Gatacre was at the head of\r\naffairs, he would resign to-morrow.  {179} Major B---- is the same.\r\nHis staff appointment will be up in October; he has eight months' leave\r\ndue to him, and would have taken it if there had been any other General\r\nhere.  But he knows how busy General Gatacre is with the plague, and\r\nfeels that it would be hard on him to get a new A.A.G. just now.  And\r\nMajor B---- is a hard-headed man, with, one would think, little\r\nsentiment about him.  But I could give you many instances.  Captain\r\nC---- of the Bombay Infantry, who is working as a secretary in the\r\noffice, is only staying because General Gatacre is the Chief....  The\r\nGeneral had a great dinner last month for all the medical men in\r\nBombay, and as they refrained from discussing the plague, or their\r\nmethods of treating it, it went off very well.  Last week we had\r\nanother dinner of twenty-four, to which all the Russian, German, and\r\nAustrian scientists and all the foreign consuls were invited; it was a\r\ndecidedly interesting evening.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn April 30 the General writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"... We are still struggling with the plague, and though it is milder\r\nin Bombay it is still dreadfully severe in the provinces all around.\r\nWe have now been put on to take up the provinces, and it is like paying\r\nthe labourers of an enormous town when our pay-day comes on....  The\r\nwork and worry here is unceasing, and I really don't know when we shall\r\nbe out of the wood.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again a fortnight later:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The climate, though good for Bombay, is beastly, and there is still\r\nmuch sickness about.  {180} We lost a nurse, Miss Horne, ten days ago,\r\nof plague.  In Bombay the mortality has come down to nearly normal, but\r\nin Cutch-Mandvi it is still very bad; at the latter place, with a\r\npopulation of 10,000 actually present, they have lost 2,000 in the last\r\nfortnight!  I am just beginning to write the Report; it will take about\r\ntwo months, I think.  We trust the disease will not break out again\r\nduring the rains, but people know so little about it that it is\r\nimpossible to say.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWriting on May 21, 1897, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"... Our work has not lightened much here yet, although the disease is\r\nunder control.  You see the same organisation must exist to prevent the\r\nplague breaking out again as up to date has existed for controlling it.\r\nThere is much plague in the districts, and people are trying to get\r\nback to Bombay.  Many come in with the disease on them, but we catch\r\nthem all at the stations and Bunders, and put them in hospital.  Now we\r\nare stopping every one coming in and detaining them eight days, to make\r\nsure they have not got the disease.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn India that year the Queen's birthday was to be celebrated on June\r\n22.  Lord Sandhurst invited the General to his official dinner on the\r\noccasion, and urged him to come to Poona for a few days' change; but\r\nthe latter declined the kind invitation, being fearful lest\r\ndisturbances should occur in Bombay owing to the general holiday.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A murderous assault]\r\n\r\nThat very night, at Poona, as the guests were returning after the\r\ndinner, a horrible outrage was {181} perpetrated.  In the darkness\r\narmed men climbed on to the back of two open carriages and shot the\r\nofficers riding in them.  Mr. Ayerst, who with his wife was in the\r\nfirst carriage attacked, died on the spot, being shot through the head.\r\nIt was afterwards shown that there was no ill-feeling against this\r\nyoung officer, and that he was the victim of a mistake.  In the\r\ncarriage immediately following, Mr. Rand, a political officer who had\r\nbeen acting as Chairman of the Poona Plague Committee, was driving\r\nalone; he was shot through the lungs, and though at one time there\r\nseemed some hope of his recovery, he succumbed about ten days later.\r\n\r\nIt was well known that Gatacre had been receiving threatening\r\nletters[9]; violent language of this sort had even appeared in the\r\npapers.  It was therefore natural that a very strong wave of sympathy\r\nand resentment at such an outrage should have been felt in Bombay,\r\nwhere the measures likely to provoke such personal retribution had\r\nnecessarily been more drastic.\r\n\r\n\r\n[9] See _Advocate of India_, April 13, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe General writes on June 25:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"... Our dinner was a success, but the affair at Poona has rather upset\r\npeople; it appears that the people there have been determined to have\r\nthe blood of the Plague Committee, and accordingly arranged to\r\nassassinate them.  Rand I fear must die; Ayerst, who was shot by\r\nmistake, was killed at once; L----, who was on the Committee as\r\nsegregation officer, was wanted, but the assassin mistook Ayerst for\r\n{182} him.  I trust the man will be discovered; we know who the\r\ninstigator is, but it will be difficult to prove it.  I wish I was on\r\nthe job.  I went to Poona yesterday, and saw the place, and had a long\r\ntalk with Brewin, head detective; he seems fairly confident he will\r\ntrace the murderers and bring the crime home to the suspected\r\ninstigators.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Farewell]\r\n\r\nThough telegrams conveying the welcome news had reached him a fortnight\r\nearlier, it was not till the end of June that Bombay learnt that its\r\nGeneral Officer Commanding had been appointed to the command of a\r\nBrigade at Aldershot, and would shortly be leaving the scene of his\r\nlabours.  The city had now been pronounced free from plague, hospitals\r\nwere being closed on all sides, and employés of all ranks were daily\r\ndismissed.  The Gatacre Committee had succeeded in stamping out the\r\nplague, and a chorus of gratitude arose towards the man to whose\r\ncourage and determination the success of the attempt was mainly\r\nattributed.  Every community wished to present him with a token of its\r\nrecognition, while all combined to entertain him \"on a very grand\r\nscale.\"[10]  Leave was obtained from the Government of India to accept\r\nfive testimonials, which, being cased in the silver cylinders familiar\r\nto the Anglo-Indian, are as beautiful as their contents are unique.\r\nTwo of these offerings were a source of special pride and pleasure to\r\ntheir recipient.  The casket {183} presented by \"The Citizens of\r\nBombay\" contains a scroll of parchment on which sixty signatures\r\ntestify that all the representative men in the city, Christian,\r\nMussulman, and Hindu, all merged their differences in their unanimous\r\nappreciation of the brilliant qualities and self-sacrificing devotion\r\nof the Chairman of the Bombay Plague Committee.  A silver box presented\r\nby the seven officers who had so loyally served on the Committee\r\nthroughout those four arduous months was also specially prized.  But I\r\nam very sure that he would wish me not to omit a record of the offering\r\nof the Plague Staff, native clerks, engineers, and workmen of all\r\nclasses; or of the touching farewell accorded him by the Sisters of the\r\nCross at the Bandora Convent.\r\n\r\n\r\n[10] See _Bombay Gazette_, July 6, 1897, and _Times of India_, July 22,\r\n1807.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn July 2, one week before he sailed for home, he writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am looking forward to getting back to life again; I have been buried\r\nin a plague-pit for the last few months.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{184}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n1897-1898\r\n\r\nFROM ALDERSHOT TO BERBER\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1897]\r\n\r\nWhen Gatacre reached Aldershot on Sunday, August 11, 1897, he found\r\nthat his Brigade was already engaged in manoeuvres.  The training was\r\nso arranged that year that though a continuous scheme was carried on\r\nfrom day to day, the troops returned each evening to their barracks.\r\nHis Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught, who commanded the Aldershot\r\nDistrict, sent a kind message of welcome to the new Brigadier, saying\r\nthat he would not expect to see him out for the first few days, but\r\nhoped that he would soon be able to take up the command of his troops\r\nin the field.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Route-marching]\r\n\r\nAs the field-days all took place within easy reach of Aldershot, many\r\nladies used at first to ride out on their bicycles to see what was\r\ngoing on.  This practice was, however, suddenly dropped after we learnt\r\nthat two of our friends had been taken prisoners one day.  They were\r\ndetained, and entertained, at the Headquarter Camp during the day's\r\noperations, and were not liberated until the troops were on the march\r\n{185} homewards.  It was thought that ladies thus prowling round until\r\nthey got in touch with their husbands' corps would quite innocently\r\ncarry information that would materially affect the execution of the\r\nmilitary scheme.\r\n\r\nIt was a great pleasure to Gatacre to find himself in England again.\r\nHis sociable and friendly instincts all came into play.  I remember his\r\ngetting hold of a list of the cadets at Sandhurst, and seeking out the\r\nsons of his friends, and asking them over to such events as would\r\ninterest them.  He set about getting horses, and looked forward to a\r\nhunting season at home.  The Brigade route-marching was positively an\r\nenjoyment to him; he took so much interest in his new regiments that he\r\nwould get up early on the route-marching days and be on the barrack\r\nsquare to see the first battalion march out, and sit there on his horse\r\nuntil the last man of the last battalion had passed him.  Then\r\ncantering on, he would work his way up to the head of the column and\r\nsee the first and the last company march in.  He found the most genuine\r\nand unaffected pleasure in every phase of his work.  The conditions\r\nunder which it was carried out were much easier and less exacting than\r\nthey had been in India.  Indeed, the light work that goes on after\r\nOctober 1 was so much of a holiday to him that all thought of long\r\nleave was postponed till later in the season.\r\n\r\nAt Christmas he took ten days' leave, which we spent at my father's\r\nhouse in Sussex.  The distance being only twenty-four miles, and the\r\n{186} weather being open, we did the journey on horseback, and had a\r\nfew days' hunting with Lord Leconfield's hounds during our visit.  On\r\nMonday, January 3, we rode back, and, arriving late, had just sat down\r\nto luncheon when the A.D.C. suddenly turned up, bringing a telegram in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1898]\r\n\r\n\"This seemed so important, sir,\" he said, \"that I thought I ought to\r\nbring it myself.\"\r\n\r\nThe telegram was from the War Office in London to the Aldershot\r\nDivisional Office, and ran:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Please send General Gatacre and Major Snow, Brigade-Major, here as\r\nsoon as possible; may be wanted for foreign service.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere had been a paragraph in the morning papers announcing the\r\nmovement of troops from Cairo up the Nile, and this news supplied us\r\nwith the true interpretation.  The General got away by the next train,\r\nand in the afternoon sent back this telegram:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Arrive 9.15; sail Wednesday next.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving returned so recently from India, the General had all that he\r\nwanted in the way of field-service uniform and camp kit.  Though\r\ntwenty-four hours seemed a short time in which to make preparations for\r\nsuch a momentous journey, still he got away more comfortably than the\r\nother men who had received the same short summons.  On Tuesday morning\r\nhe cleared up work in the office, and handed over {187} his Brigade; he\r\nleft Aldershot in the evening, and started from Charing Cross at 8.30\r\na.m. on Wednesday, January 5, 1898, for Egypt, via Marseilles.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to tell over again the long story of the gradual loss\r\nof the Soudan to Egypt, with the encroachment of the Dervish Empire,\r\nnor of the fall of Khartoum with the death of General Gordon (\"my\r\nbrother dreamer in an iron race\") on January 26, 1885, nor of the\r\npatient preparation that had been going on in the thirteen years that\r\nhad passed.  This book is concerned only with the final act of the\r\ndrama, the defeat of the forces of the Khalifa Abdullahi, and the\r\nrecovery of the capital.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 Sir Herbert Kitchener was Sirdar of the Egyptian Army.  He had\r\norganised his force for the purpose it was to fulfil, and had gradually\r\ncrept onwards up the Nile, until, on September 3, 1897, he reached and\r\noccupied Berber.  At that point he was, as it were, within striking\r\ndistance of Khartoum.  This view seems also to have been held by the\r\nenemy, for in December the Intelligence Department heard of warlike\r\npreparations on his part.  This report precipitated the massing of the\r\nforces on our side.  The Sirdar knew that he could call for the\r\nassistance of British troops when the real struggle was to take place,\r\nand he made his call in December.\r\n\r\nOrders were immediately issued for the concentration of three\r\nbattalions at Wady Halfa.  The 1st Lincolnshire and the 1st Cameron\r\n{188} Highlanders were already at Cairo, the 1st Warwickshire were\r\nmoved from Alexandria, while the 1st Seaforth Highlanders at Malta were\r\nwarned and shipped to Cairo in a very short space of time.  This\r\nregiment was also pushed forward, as soon as others had been brought\r\nfrom Crete and Gibraltar and Burma, to maintain the usual garrison in\r\nLower Egypt.  The command of this service Brigade was given to\r\nMajor-General W. F. Gatacre, C.B., D.S.O.  Major d'Oyly Snow\r\naccompanied him as Brigade-Major, and Captain R. G. Brooke as A.D.C.\r\n\r\nThe General proceeded by train to Assouan, and by boat to Wady Halfa,\r\nwhich he reached on Thursday, January 25.  It was here that he first\r\nmet the Sirdar.  But the troops had already passed on in front to\r\nRailhead, which was then the other side of Abu Hamed.  From Wady Halfa\r\nthe new Desert Railway, which was still under construction, leaves the\r\nNile and strikes out to the south-east across the open country towards\r\nAbu Hamed, a journey of about 250 miles.\r\n\r\nWriting from Camp Guheish, about seventeen miles south of Abu Hamed, on\r\nFebruary 2, the General says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We arrived here last night about eight o'clock, after a long journey\r\nacross the desert from Halfa.  Such a desert--not a thing to be seen\r\nbut sand and a few low black rocks jutting out of the plain.  A few\r\nstraw-coloured birds, like stonechats, and a wagtail I saw at one\r\nplace; goodness knows what they live on.  At {189} one o'clock we were\r\nwithin one mile of Abu Hamed, and were steaming steadily along, when,\r\nin ploughing through a sand-drift, we went off the line, and had to\r\nturn to and clear the line with the few shovels on the train and our\r\nhands.  Fortunately we were only a mile from Abu Hamed, so I sent on a\r\nmessenger, and in fifty minutes a relief train came up, and, with the\r\nhelp of jacks, the engine was got on to the line again in four hours.\r\nIt was fortunate we did not run off the line in the middle of the\r\nDesert, or we should have been delayed at least a day, and would have\r\nbeen put to inconvenience for food, though of course we had some.\r\nWell, I found Snow waiting for us, and we detrained our horses safely,\r\nand then, after going on another mile, we came to our camp, placed\r\nbetween the Nile and the railway--a howling desert, with a tremendous\r\nwind blowing night and day.  The dust fills everything, but the climate\r\nup to date is magnificent, and I hope will continue so for a long time;\r\nquite cold at night and in the morning, sufficient to make me put on my\r\ngreat-coat, and at night, though of course I sleep in my clothes, I am\r\nglad of all the blankets I can put on....  The Maxim guns I left at\r\nHalfa temporarily, as we haven't got sufficient food for the mules yet,\r\nbut as soon as the train is running through we shall have them up.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA fortnight later the railway had grown longer, and as Railhead\r\nadvanced, so the British Brigade moved southwards and finally camped at\r\nAbu Dis.\r\n\r\nGatacre used the three weeks that the troops were encamped by the\r\nrailway to get in touch with his Brigade--to feel and to improve their\r\n{190} marching powers.  His methods excited some comment at the time,\r\nbut afterwards, when there was a real call for exceptional exertions,\r\nit was frankly admitted that the previous training had been of great\r\nvalue.  \"It is impossible to deny that, while discipline and health\r\nwere successfully maintained, the general efficiency was greatly\r\nincreased.\"[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] _The River War_, by Winston Spencer Churchill, vol. i. p. 366.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were, however, two directions in which efficiency was seriously\r\nhampered--boots and bullets.  The General writes on February 2:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The present-shaped bullet .303 Lee-Metford rifle has little stopping\r\npower.  Well, we have only this class of ammunition, so I am altering\r\nthe shape of the bullet to that of the Dum-Dum bullet, which has a\r\nrounded point.  I do this by filing the point off.  Before I left Cairo\r\nI provided four hundred files and small gauges to test the length of\r\nthe altered bullet, and daily here we have 2,800 men engaged on this\r\nwork.  I borrowed fifty railway rails and mounted them flat side\r\nuppermost, to form anvils on which to file.  We have a portion of men\r\nunpacking, and another portion packing, so that the same men are always\r\nat the same work.  The men are getting very sharp at it; it would make\r\na capital picture.  This is a terrible place for boots, and many of the\r\nmen whose boots were not new at starting have mere apologies for boots\r\non their feet.  Fortunately, we have time to rectify this, and I have\r\ntaken the necessary steps.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again a week later:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The men are working very well; we have {191} no drink, and therefore\r\nno crime or sickness.  I am getting on well with altering our\r\nammunition.  We have 3,000,000 rounds to alter, but are making good\r\nprogress, altering about 80,000 rounds per day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same letter we read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There are crocodiles in the river here, but not many.  A fisherman\r\ncaught one about three feet long, a most vicious little brute, who\r\nsnaps at everyone and everything; he is tied by the middle with a piece\r\nof string, and swims about in a bath; he will probably be eaten when\r\nhis master gets hungry.  Three days ago a gazelle was trapped and sent\r\nin to us by a native.  He was uninjured, and a beautiful little brute,\r\nwith large eyes like Lorna's.  We all decided to keep him as a pet, and\r\nhe got quite tame in a few hours.  But alas! we got hungry, and some\r\none suggested that he might escape--so we ate him.  Perhaps it was the\r\nwisest course.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated Abu Dis, February 24, we get the first word of the\r\nforced march that was ordered on the following day:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am so frightfully busy that I cannot find time for anything, so I\r\nthink I may as well sit down and write to you for relaxation.\r\nYesterday we had a seventy-mile ride to a place called Bastinab and\r\nback, looking out for future camping-grounds, for I have got a hint to\r\nbe ready to move on at once, as Mahmoud at Metemma has crossed over to\r\nthe east side of the Nile, and threatens to attack Atbara and\r\nBerber....  We may have to move and stack our camp baggage, etc., by\r\nthe side of the line {192} in the desert, and march on in light order,\r\nthe same sort of thing as in Chitral--a most exciting business this\r\nwould be, wouldn't it?\r\n\r\n\"My Maxim Battery came in to-day; I am quite pleased to get it.  The\r\nmen are looking splendid, and we have only thirty or so sick out of a\r\ntotal strength of nearly 3,000.  I have now got my camel transport,\r\nsomething like 800 animals; this makes me more independent, and if I am\r\nrequired to move I can do so.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween February 22 and 25 a series of telegrams had been flying\r\nbetween the Sirdar at Berber and the Brigadier at Abu Dis.  All the\r\ndetails of the march which would be necessary to bring the British\r\ntroops forward were proposed on the one side and sanctioned on the\r\nother, so that when on Friday, February 25, the following telegram was\r\nreceived at midday, orders were immediately issued and the start was\r\nmade that evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"News has come in that enemy in ten rubs advancing.  You can therefore\r\nmove Brigade as arranged.--SIRDAR.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(A rub means any number between 500 and 1,500 men.)\r\n\r\nTo which this message was sent in reply:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I shall arrive at Atbara Camp nine or ten o'clock on Wednesday second\r\nwith Maxims and 2,000 men; guns and cavalry will arrive on\r\nfirst.--GATACRE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI have found a rough draft of the official {193} report of the forced\r\nmarch made by the British Brigade on Berber in accordance with the\r\norder received, and have decided to print this narrative almost as it\r\nstands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The 1st Lincolnshire and detachment 1st Royal Warwickshire Regiment,\r\nwith the six guns Maxim Battery, Royal Engineer detachment, Army\r\nHospital Corps, and Army Service Corps, moved to Railhead, sixteen\r\nmiles, by an empty ballast train, thence by route march seven and a\r\nhalf miles to camp at El Sherreik, which they reached at daylight on\r\nthe morning of Saturday, February 26, all well.  Remainder of Warwicks\r\nmoved at midnight, arriving at Sherreik 7.30 a.m.  The 1st Cameron\r\nHighlanders bivouacked by the side of the railway, and on the arrival\r\nof a train at 5 a.m. were railed to Railhead.  They reached camp at\r\n9.30 a.m. all well.\r\n\r\n\"At El Sherreik the Brigade halted for the day, and at 10 p.m. started\r\non their march for Diveryah.  Tea was made at Nedi, and the troops left\r\nagain, after resting, at 2.30 a.m. on Sunday.  Bastinab was reached\r\nshortly after daybreak.  Captain Bainbridge, Egyptian Army, supplied\r\nfirewood, and fires were lit, it being very cold.  Here sixty pairs of\r\nfantasses were taken, as no water was available _en route_.  The road\r\nonward proved rocky and sandy in places, and was very heavy going for\r\ntired men, but Diveryah was reached at 3 p.m.  The stony nature of the\r\ncountry completely wore out many of the boots.  The last three miles\r\nwere very trying, as the sun was hot; there was no shade, and the men\r\nfelt the weight of their equipment.  The bivouac was laid in a small\r\nnullah, running at right angles to the Nile, and the men made\r\nthemselves very comfortable.  Finding that a {194} great number of men\r\nhad worn through the soles of their boots, I arranged with Captain\r\nStrickland, Egyptian Army, to convey about 400 men, under the command\r\nof Major Napier, Cameron Highlanders, by an Egyptian steamer to Berber.\r\nThey left Diveryah on Monday morning, February 28, and reached Berber\r\nthe same day, where they were refitted from the boot store of the\r\nEgyptian Army, and rejoined the Brigade on arrival.\r\n\r\n\"At 2.30 a.m. on Monday, February 28, the Brigade moved from its\r\nbivouac _en route_ to Um Hosheyo by the desert track, which, almost\r\nimmediately after leaving the bivouac, lay through brushwood and broken\r\nground.  Owing to touch being lost by the rear battalion, a delay of\r\nthree-quarters of an hour ensued, when the march was resumed over a\r\nrough and stony piece of country.  After about five miles the track\r\nimproved, and at 6.15 a.m. the first man of the Brigade marched into Um\r\nHosheyo.  Continuing its march the advanced guard reached a grove of\r\nDom palms at Wady Hamar at 8.30 a.m., where a halt was made till 4.30\r\np.m. to enable the troops to cook and sleep.  At 4.30 p.m. the troops\r\nagain moved forward over a good level track, and continued marching\r\nuntil 10.45 p.m., at which hour Genenetti was reached.  Total distance\r\nfrom El Sherreik to Genenetti forty-five miles.  Here we dropped\r\nanother 122 men whose boots had completely gone.\r\n\r\n\"At 3 a.m. on Tuesday, March 1, the Brigade paraded and moved off along\r\na fairly good track, heavy in places, for Aboudyeh, twelve miles.\r\nAfter a trying hot march the Brigade reached a point two miles north of\r\nAboudyeh at 9 a.m., where they rested till 4.30 p.m.  Three men were\r\nreported missing, but it was subsequently {195} ascertained that they\r\nhad proceeded with other men who had worn out their boots from\r\nGenenetti, under command of Major Snow, Brigade-Major, with spare\r\nammunition and commissariat supplies.  At 4.30 p.m. the troops left\r\nAboudyeh for El Hassa, thirteen miles, a very hot evening, over (at\r\nfirst) a good hard plain, crossed here and there by heavy sandy khors;\r\nthere was little wind, and the column marched till 11 p.m. through\r\ndense clouds of dust.  After marching about two miles the Brigade\r\nhalted to give the men water at Aboudyeh, where a certain number of\r\nwells containing brackish water were found.  The inhabitants turned out\r\nand provided _dilus_ (buckets) and ropes, willingly giving the men\r\nwater.  Company after company filed past, each man getting half a\r\ncanteen full of water.  After this halt no more water was obtainable,\r\nas the route lay inland, and the men had to rely on their water-bottles.\r\n\r\n\"At 11 p.m. on Tuesday the Brigade filed on to the El Hassa\r\ncamping-ground, about three miles north of Berber, and bivouacked by\r\nthe side of the Nile.  Two miles before reaching El Hassa, the General\r\nOfficer Commanding received a letter by camel messenger from His\r\nExcellency the Sirdar, directing that the column should halt for\r\ntwenty-four hours, and pass through Berber at 5.30 a.m. on the morning\r\nof March 3.  The Brigade, therefore, remained halted till 3.30 a.m. on\r\nthe morning of Thursday the 3rd, when it marched for Berber.\r\n\r\n\"On arriving at the north end of the town of Berber, the column was\r\nreinforced by the 400 men who had been refitted with boots from the\r\nEgyptian Army stores.  The Sirdar met the column at about 5.30 a.m. on\r\nthe outskirts of the town, and was heartily cheered by the troops {196}\r\nas they passed him.  The bands of the Soudanese battalions played in\r\nthe three regiments, and the men met with a great reception from all\r\nranks of the battalions in garrison, who turned out to a man, and\r\nafterwards provided tea and cigarettes for the men, and breakfasts for\r\nthe officers, at the camping-ground.  The officers likewise received\r\nmuch hospitality at the hands of the Sirdar and the various messes in\r\ngarrison.  At 4.30 p.m. the troops moved on again to Camp Dabeika,\r\neleven miles from Berber, along an excellent desert track, about a mile\r\nfrom, and parallel to, the Nile.  The Brigade arrived with no sick man.\r\nThe conduct of the troops during the whole march was excellent; there\r\nwere no cases of difficulty between them and the natives of the\r\ncountry, and there was no crime, which may be considered as highly\r\nsatisfactory and showing the state of discipline in which the\r\ncommanding officers hold their regiments.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe General marched the greater part of the way on foot, and made use\r\nof his spare horses to mount footsore men.  When questioned on this\r\npoint, he gave the following reply in a letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"With regard to my doing our long march on foot, it was nothing to me;\r\ntroops necessarily march slowly, and it is pleasanter and less\r\nfatiguing (not to speak of its being a better example) for me to walk\r\nall the way.  I always had my horse with me, and I constantly had to\r\nget on to go to the head of the column, or the tail, to see if all was\r\ngoing right, and this made a nice change.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distance from Railhead to El Hassa, just {197} short of Berber, was\r\nsixty-five to seventy miles, and this journey was accomplished between\r\n10 p.m. on Saturday and 11 p.m. on Tuesday--seventy-three hours.\r\nAnother fifteen miles on Thursday completed the march to Dabeika.\r\n\r\nThis concentration had its effect on the enemy, who gave up any idea of\r\nattacking the Sirdar on the Nile, and the camp was unmolested for the\r\nnext three weeks.  Some critics have on this account made out that\r\nGatacre overtaxed his troops in bringing them along at an unnecessary\r\npace in such a climate; but surely the measure of the necessity for\r\nrapidity lies in the danger which this junction averted rather than in\r\nthe security which it brought about.  Moreover, it was the Sirdar on\r\nthe spot who decided and gave orders: the General carried them out.  At\r\nthe time he wrote of it as a race between himself and Mahmoud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{198}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n1898\r\n\r\nATBARA AND OMDURMAN\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Combined force]\r\n\r\nAll through the winter every movement on the part of the Dervish\r\nleaders was carefully watched by the gun-boats on the Nile and the\r\nEgyptian cavalry on its banks.  The Intelligence Department had a\r\nsystem of espionage by which the feeling inside Omdurman was made known\r\nto them.  The Sirdar knew that the Khalifa was unwilling to turn out\r\nhis main army, but that a large force was preparing to move out of\r\nMetemma under the combined command of the Emir Mahmoud and the cavalry\r\nleader Osman Digna.  Before long the Sirdar knew that this force had\r\ncrossed to Shendy on the right bank of the Nile on February 28, and\r\nthat on March 13 they had reached Aliab, which is only twenty miles\r\nsouth of Dakila, the Egyptian outpost.  But their subsequent designs\r\nwere not known.  It was doubtful whether their scheme was to attack the\r\nSirdar at Dakila, a fort which had recently been built on the right\r\nbank of the Nile, where the large tributary stream of the Atbara flows\r\nin from the south-east, or to make a dash {199} on Berber and sever the\r\nrailway communication lower down.  Eventually the Dervish leader found\r\nhimself unable to carry out either of these schemes, the fortress\r\nappearing too formidable after the arrival of the British contingent,\r\nand Berber proving too remote.  He decided therefore to threaten both\r\npoints, and took up a strong position on the banks of the Atbara, about\r\nthirty miles above Dakila, which he fortified and entrenched\r\nelaborately, and waited for his foes to take the initiative.\r\n\r\nThe force with which the Sirdar could meet the enemy was composed of\r\nthe British Brigade, which had now been completed to four battalions by\r\nthe arrival of the Seaforth Highlanders, and three Brigades of the\r\nEgyptian Army, commanded respectively by Colonel Maxwell, Colonel\r\nMacdonald, and Colonel Lewis.  There were also eight squadrons of\r\ncavalry, and two Maxim guns under Colonel Broadwood, six companies of\r\nthe Camel Corps under Major Tudway, and some artillery, both heavy and\r\nlight, under Colonel Long.  The total ran up to nearly 14,000 men of\r\nall arms.  This force was concentrated at Kenur on the Nile, and all\r\nthe officers seem genuinely to have held the opinion that contact with\r\nthe enemy might occur at any moment.  But as it turned out, it was not\r\ntill seventeen days after the Sirdar's force started on their march to\r\nmeet the enemy that the two armies met.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, March 20, the whole force marched across the angle of the\r\ndesert to Da {200} Hudi, a camp on the Atbara River about twelve miles\r\nsouth-east of Kenur.  They started as if only for a reconnaissance in\r\nforce, for we read: \"We are taking only one day's supplies and what we\r\nstand up in, one blanket being carried for us on camels.\"  The hospital\r\nstaff and transport was cut down to such narrow dimensions that it was\r\nhardly adequate for the work when the big fight really took place.\r\nThrough all the next seventeen days the force lived on tinned beef and\r\nbiscuits, in daily anticipation of closing with the enemy.  But what\r\nwas privation, discomfort, and hardship to every man in the force was\r\nvexation of spirit also to Gatacre.  Writing on March 30, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We may move to-morrow against Mahmoud, who is still in his entrenched\r\njungle position at Hilgi on the east bank of the Atbara, eighteen miles\r\nsouth of this.  I have been urging the Sirdar to move forward and\r\nattack him, as we have been inactive for some days, while Mahmoud is\r\nmerely sitting and waiting for us.  The inaction has a bad effect, both\r\non our men and on the enemy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again on April 3:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We are leaving the camp to-morrow, and going on to one three and a\r\nhalf to four miles south of Abadar.  I was in great hopes that the\r\nSirdar would attack Mahmoud at once.  I thought I had persuaded him,\r\nbut he wired my recommendation to Lord Cromer, and gave his own opinion\r\nand that of General Hunter, which were for waiting.  To-day he got a\r\nwire from Lord Cromer, deciding not to attack--a great {201} pity, I\r\nthink.  At present the situation is as under: Mahmoud is in a zariba\r\nabout ten miles from here, with about 20,000 men, very much crushed up\r\nfor space, exceedingly hard up for food, and so placed that they\r\ncannot, in the event of a reverse, get away at all as an organised\r\nforce.  There never was such a chance, and we are missing it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nContinuing his letter on the following day, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday, after writing so far, I got a bad go of colic, or malaria,\r\nor something, which made me feel very bad; but I am better to-day, and\r\nhope to be all right to-morrow.  I hear that another telegram has come\r\nfrom Lord Cromer, saying, on consideration he leaves the matter to the\r\nSirdar, so I presume he will now attack as soon as possible.  I hope\r\nso.  We have moved to-day to Abadar, and are encamped in a shady belt\r\nof trees, near the river, but it is getting very hot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A forward policy]\r\n\r\nDuring this time there had been frequent reconnaissances in the\r\ndirection of the enemy's camp by the cavalry and Camel Corps and\r\nartillery.  Three small actions had been fought; and with the help of\r\nthe information thus obtained, and from the tales of deserters, the\r\nposition, size, and strength of Mahmoud's camp were known with\r\nconsiderable accuracy.\r\n\r\nIt was the responsibility which Gatacre had incurred by advocating an\r\nearly attack on this fortified position, against the advice of others\r\nbetter acquainted with Soudan warfare, that {202} coloured all his\r\ndispositions when the day arrived.  He did not, however, let his\r\nnatural forwardness of character deceive him as to the resistance to be\r\novercome.  The author of _The River War_ has already made this point,\r\nalthough he did not know the true interpretation of the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible not to sympathise with General Gatacre's obvious\r\ndetermination that, whatever happened to the other parts of the\r\nassault, the British Brigade should burst into the enclosure at all\r\ncosts.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] _The River War_, vol. i. p. 457.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis feeling of exaggerated personal responsibility led the General to\r\ntake up his position at the head of his Brigade.  In his letter written\r\nfour days later he anticipates the criticism that would be levelled\r\nagainst him on this account, and shows that he had weighed the point,\r\nand had deliberately forsaken the traditional place.  Scientific\r\nsoldiers may criticise his action, but, according to Mr. Churchill,\r\nthere was to a civilian a certain grim splendour in the spectacle.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] _Ibid._, vol. i. p. 468.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the General's last letter before the fight we find the following\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My men are ready.  I have taught them all I know.  We shall do our\r\nbest, and I think my regiments will do all I expect of them; God bless\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The assault]\r\n\r\nThe battle of the Atbara was fought on Good Friday, April 8, 1898.  It\r\nwas a brilliant victory, and resulted in the capture of Mahmoud and the\r\n{203} total defeat of his army.  The enemy's losses were estimated at\r\n40 Emirs and 3,000 Dervishes killed.  On our side the losses were 24\r\nkilled and 101 wounded in the British Brigade, and 56 killed and 371\r\nwounded in the Egyptian Army.  It is interesting to note that the\r\ncasualties in the two Egyptian Brigades, which took part in the assault\r\non the zariba simultaneously with the British regiments, amount to 381,\r\nwhich gives a higher ratio per Brigade than the figure for the British\r\ntroops, which is 125.  So that it is scarcely possible to maintain that\r\nthe formation adopted in Gatacre's brigade was peculiarly destructive.\r\n\r\nThe General's own letter of April 14 from Darmali furnishes a very\r\ngraphic account of the engagement and the return march:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They all did very well, but I had to get a bit forward to watch that\r\nall went well.  Between you and me, a General Officer should not get up\r\ninto the firing line of his Brigade without good reason; this I know,\r\nbut I had good reasons for going there.  When your whole Brigade only\r\ncovers a space of 200 yards by 200 yards, it is immaterial where you\r\nare, so far as the penetration of bullets is concerned, but what is\r\nimportant is that the G.O.C. should be where he can watch any important\r\npoint....  Well, our men started the ball, and we pushed straight on\r\nover the stockade.  It was pretty hot when we were pulling away the\r\nzariba fence; the ground was flying up as if it was being harrowed all\r\nround me, with the fire of the riflemen, and I lost a terrible bunch of\r\nmen at that {204} spot.  Of course I saw the sooner we got to the\r\nstockade the sooner we should stop the rifle fire, so we rushed it, and\r\nas soon as we were in we soon killed all the riflemen and the spearmen\r\nthere, but we had a real good fight.  The general operations of the\r\nday, however, were as follows: On evening of the 7th (Thursday) the\r\nBritish Brigade and three Egyptian Brigades moved out from Abadar at 6\r\np.m., my Brigade leading; we moved in square about three miles, sat\r\ndown in the Desert, had some food and water, and slept in square till 1\r\no'clock a.m.  Of course we took no blankets or anything with us, merely\r\none day's food, ammunition, and water.  At one o'clock we moved on in\r\nsquare, the other brigades following; it was moonlight, and a curious\r\nsight to see these three enormous hollow squares moving solemnly on\r\nwith not a note or a whisper even--no smoking.  We went on till just\r\nbefore dawn, then halted and deployed into line; a fine line it\r\nwas--the Camerons, Seaforths, and Lincolnshires, with the Warwicks in\r\ncolumn on the left flank at right angles.\r\n\r\n\"We then advanced a bit, till we could see the Dem (zariba), pulled up,\r\nand commenced firing with our artillery, in hopes of drawing Mahmoud\r\nout to fight, and secondly of pounding his army well before we\r\nassaulted the position.  Our cavalry was on my left, watching the left\r\nflank; the Dervishes made several attempts to get their cavalry out,\r\nbut failed.  Well, after hammering away for an hour, the order for\r\nassault was given, and away we went, the, Camerons covering the front\r\nof the assaulting column, and firing as they went; directly we got on\r\nto the crest of the hill men began to tumble about, and I gave the\r\norder to rush the zariba and stockade.\r\n\r\n{205}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The return march]\r\n\r\n\"We lost some very good officers and men killed, but that must always\r\nbe; we lost fewer than I expected.  Captain Findlay, Camerons, a nice\r\nfellow, was killed getting over the zariba.  Captain Urquhart, of the\r\nCamerons, too, was killed.  He had just come back from the Staff\r\nCollege on purpose to take part in the expedition.  Gore was quite a\r\nboy.  I was with Captain Findlay most of the march to the zariba, as\r\nhis was the company of direction, and as we were marching principally\r\nby the stars, I had to be there or thereabouts.  After they were dead I\r\ncut off a bit of hair from Findlay and Urquhart to send home; Gore had\r\nhad his hair cut so short that none was procurable.  We buried them all\r\nin one grave, immediately after the fight.  A curious sight: the Pipers\r\nand Buglers of a Soudanese battalion played the Dead March in Saul,\r\nthen the Pipers of the Camerons and Seaforths played a Lament, then we\r\nfilled in the grave.  We had amongst the four Brigades about 600 killed\r\nand wounded, and we had, immediately we had buried the dead and dressed\r\nthe wounded, to carry all these men back about eight miles across the\r\ndesert.  We told off eight men to each stretcher, and moved slowly\r\nhomewards, leaving at 6 p.m.  The fight was over about 8.45 a.m. I\r\nthink, but it took us all day to dress the wounded and build sheds for\r\nthem (of bushes).  The sun, of course, is very hot, and we had all to\r\nsit in the desert, as the bush and the river-bank was so full of dead\r\nand dying Dervishes as to make it inadvisable for our men to lie there.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\"Now I suppose we shall be here for three months, to refit and prepare\r\nfor the next go-in at Khartoum, which will require careful doing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n{206}\r\n\r\nThe Sirdar was naturally very much gratified at the decisive nature of\r\nhis victory, and was overwhelmed with telegrams of congratulation.  The\r\nfollowing quotation from an article in _Blackwood's Magazine_ of\r\nDecember 1902 tells us how the Sirdar expressed himself to his\r\ncolleague:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Kitchener was dictating his dispatch to the Queen when there passed in\r\nfront of us a pony led by a syce, and laden with spoils selected from\r\nthat field of plenty with the praiseworthy discrimination of an art\r\nconnoisseur.  Kitchener hailed the man, and selecting the finest coat\r\nof mail and the most beautifully finished spear, bade me take them to\r\nGeneral Gatacre with his warmest thanks for the splendid gallantry and\r\ngood judgment with which he had led his fine Brigade.  I seem now to\r\nsee the pleasant light that shone in that brave soldier's eyes as I\r\ngave him the message word for word.  What a splendid fellow, and how\r\nwillingly any of us would have given our right hands to save him from\r\nthe fate that befell him--at the hands of his own chiefs--in South\r\nAfrica.\"[3]\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] _Ex_ article, \"Campaigning with Kitchener,\" December 1902, p. 738.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the official dispatch the Sirdar wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The high state of efficiency to which the British Brigade was brought\r\nis, I consider, in a large measure due to the untiring energy and\r\ndevotion to duty of Major-General Gatacre and the loyal support\r\nrendered him by the commanding officers of his battalions, all of whom\r\nhe has brought to favourable notice.  During the engagement on the 8th\r\ninst. General Gatacre showed a fine example of gallant leading.  The\r\n{207} cordiality and good feeling existing between the British and\r\nEgyptian troops, who have fought shoulder to shoulder, is to a great\r\nextent due to the hearty co-operation of General Gatacre, and I cannot\r\nspeak too highly of the services rendered by him and the troops under\r\nhis command in the recent operations.\"[4]\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] _The Times_, Wednesday, May 25, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll through May, June, and July the time hung heavily for the British\r\nBrigade.  They were quartered in the villages of Darmali and El Sillem,\r\nthe General's headquarters being at the former.  The temperature ran up\r\nto 106° and 108° in the shade, but he makes light of the heat and says,\r\n\"One does not feel it as one does in India.\"\r\n\r\nOne little incident of these weary days has survived, and is recorded\r\nby an officer in his recollections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When the General was inspecting the Ordnance workshops at our camp on\r\nthe Nile, a non-commissioned officer was brought to his notice as\r\nhaving done very good work.  Gatacre complimented him highly, and said:\r\n\r\n\"'Now, what can I do for you?  I'll tell you what, you shall carry my\r\nflag when we advance to Omdurman.'\r\n\r\n\"I believe the man's face was a picture, and he did not see it at all\r\nin the same light.\"[5]\r\n\r\n\r\n[5] _With the 72nd Highlanders in the Sudan Campaign_, by Colonel\r\nGranville Egerton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor, as all the Brigade knew, the General's flag had been carried at\r\nthe battle of the Atbara by Staff-Sergeant Wyeth, who had been shot\r\nthrough the knee and had subsequently died of his {208} wound, so that\r\nthe non-commissioned officer had good cause to look on it as an\r\nundesirable honour.\r\n\r\nThis matter of carrying a flag into action has also aroused comment,\r\nbut it is recorded that the Sirdar was always accompanied by the red\r\nEgyptian Flag, and it is probable that, in flying a little Union Jack\r\nbehind him, the General had merely adopted this practice to flatter the\r\nnationality of his troops.\r\n\r\nAt the end of May he made a trip in a gunboat to Shendy and Metemma,\r\nwhich he much enjoyed.  In June he took a fortnight's leave to\r\nAlexandria and Cairo.  It was while staying there that he received\r\nofficial intimation of his having been advanced to Major-General's\r\nrank, for hitherto his name had appeared in the Army List as a Colonel\r\nwith the temporary and local rank of Major-General.  According to\r\nregulations, a medical examination was necessary before this promotion\r\ncould be confirmed.  The idea that there could be any question about\r\nhis health amused Gatacre greatly, and he offered, as a test, to run a\r\nhundred yards' race with the Principal Medical Officer.  The challenge\r\nwas politely declined, and an appointment made for the formal\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Promotion]\r\n\r\nIn August Gatacre had the great satisfaction of finding himself in\r\ncommand of a Division in the field.  A second Brigade of British troops\r\nwas being sent up, and Colonel Wauchope[6] and Colonel Lyttelton[7]\r\narrived from England to take {209} over the First and Second Brigades\r\nrespectively.  But however gratifying this promotion might be, it\r\nlifted him farther from the soldiers and the fighting, and it is owing\r\nto this circumstance that his name was so little mentioned in the story\r\nof the fight before Omdurman.  This elevation, however, made no\r\ndifference to his work or his activity.  On August 17 he writes from\r\nDakila:\r\n\r\n\r\n[6] The late Major-General Andrew Wauchope, C.B.\r\n\r\n[7] General the Hon. Sir Neville Lyttelton, G.C.B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We are very busy now with embarkations and detrainments of troops\r\narriving from the north; we are up nearly every night, as trains arrive\r\nat most unearthly hours; this of course is unavoidable.  My first\r\nBrigade has gone on, and the embarkation of the second commences at\r\ndaybreak to-morrow morning....  We move by steamers towing barges to\r\nWad Bishara, about 145 miles, and thence by route march.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWad Bishara is just below the Sixth Cataract, and lies on the western\r\nbank about fifty-five miles north of Omdurman.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of the Dervish army at the battle of Omdurman took place on\r\nSunday, September 2, 1898.  The story was told with much detail in the\r\nnewspapers at the time, and has since been elaborately set out in _The\r\nRiver War_, but, notwithstanding the existence of many records, this\r\nbook would not be complete without some account of such an important\r\nevent.  Though far from being a comprehensive narrative, the General's\r\nletter is interesting in itself:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_September_ 7, 1898.\r\n\r\n\"On the morning of September 1 we marched twelve miles through jungle,\r\nfinding everywhere {210} traces of the flight of the Dervish\r\noutposts--dead animals, men, etc., who had been killed by them,\r\nprobably people attempting to desert.\r\n\r\n\"We arrived at Kerreri about 12 noon, and found a village on the river\r\nwith much open ground to our front and south-west, with a conical hill\r\nstanding up in the plain about two miles to the south.  We settled down\r\nto eat in the village, and in about an hour our cavalry sent in to say\r\nthat the Khalifa's army was on the march from Omdurman towards us in\r\nthree bodies, a centre and two wings.  As soon as we had had our food,\r\nwe set to work to get our troops into position in a kind of semicircle\r\nround the village, and strengthened ourselves with a zariba and trench,\r\nwhere zariba thorns were unprocurable; this we finished by dark, and\r\nthen sat down to eat and sleep.  The night passed quietly.  The Khalifa\r\nmissed a chance of doing us much damage by not attacking at night, but\r\nluckily he did not disturb us.\r\n\r\n\"At 3.30 a.m. we stood to our arms, ready for an attack at dawn.  It\r\nwas a beautiful moonlight night, and I had been up most of the time,\r\nwatching my line and inspecting the patrols, etc.  About six in the\r\nmorning of the 2nd we got intelligence that the Khalifa's army was\r\ncoming on, and presently they began to pour across the open ground\r\nabout two miles off, yelling like demons, apparently an endless stream\r\nof men and horses.  I have never seen anything like it--banners flying\r\nall along the line, guns firing, etc.  For an hour they kept pouring\r\nalong in thousands, and suddenly the centre of the mass turned, and\r\ncame straight for us.  I made all my men lie down, so that nothing\r\ncould be seen of us except our zariba fence.  As soon as they got\r\nwithin range, about 2,300 yds., we opened {211} fire with all our guns,\r\nrifles, and Maxims, and a hail of lead fell on the army; but they were\r\nimpervious to any influences of this kind, and kept pressing on and on\r\ntill we literally mowed them down by hundreds.  After about\r\nthree-quarters of an hour, the ground was strewn with dead and dying,\r\nand then, as our fire did not slacken, they began to turn and go, but\r\nonly at a walk, no running about it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The great fight]\r\n\r\n\"Then we advanced, and after we had moved on about one mile the centre\r\nof the Dervish force returned to the charge and fell upon a Soudanese\r\nBrigade, to whose assistance I sent a British Brigade (General\r\nWauchope's); this stayed the Dervish attack, which was driven back and\r\nfollowed up.  The whole force advanced and poured a heavy fire into the\r\nretreating Dervishes, who slowly withdrew, fighting.  We had now been\r\nat work fighting and moving from 3.30 a.m. under a heavy sun without\r\nwater, and had still four miles to march over a very sandy country, so\r\nwe started in fighting formation, keeping ourselves ready at any moment\r\nto face west again.  Well, they finally drew off to the hills, and we\r\nmoved slowly on-towards the water, which one Brigade reached at 2 p.m.\r\nand the other at 3.30 p.m.; halted there till 4.30 p.m., and then\r\nmarched on again into Omdurman, about three and a half miles; this we\r\ndid not reach till dark, as we had to go carefully.  There were still a\r\nlot of Dervishes in the town, and our gun-boats were shelling them, up\r\nthe river and in the town.  We had to bivouac out in the desert, as we\r\ncould not find a suitable place.  We could get no water that night, as\r\nthe river was too far to send to, and it was not safe to allow small\r\nparties to go out.\r\n\r\n{212}\r\n\r\n\"Next morning we marched down to the river and bivouacked on the\r\nwater's edge, and there we are now.\r\n\r\n\"The total dead counted were 10,324 as near as could be; the wounded it\r\nwould be impossible to count, as they all crowded away on to the\r\nriver-bank and into the town, but there were thousands of them,\r\npossibly another 10,000 or more, some with the most fearful wounds.  I\r\nwent out the next afternoon and also the day following with water for\r\nthe wounded.  I sent out many mules laden entirely with water, and we\r\nrelieved many of these unfortunates, but no doubt many died from want\r\nof water.\r\n\r\n\"Now the whole thing is over, except an excursion to Fashoda, which the\r\nSirdar is arranging; I think he goes up to-morrow with 100 men of the\r\nNorthumberland Fusiliers in a steamer.\r\n\r\n\"We had a nice day at Khartoum; we (800 men from various battalions),\r\ntwo or three bands, nearly all the officers, and an equal number of\r\nEgyptians steamed up on gun-boats to Khartoum, landed opposite Gordon's\r\nPalace, hoisted the Union Jack and Egyptian flag simultaneously,\r\nsaluted them, and then held a Memorial Service for Gordon.  All our\r\nclergymen were present; the Sirdar made me stand on his right hand,\r\nthus paying a compliment to the British troops.  Afterwards we wandered\r\nabout and hunted among the ruins to find traces of Gordon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Friendly words]\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the General enhanced his reputation enormously\r\nin this campaign.  Not only was his work done in the sight of Europe,\r\nbut it was done under the eyes of a very exacting master.  _The World_\r\nwrote at the time: {213} \"Perhaps the highest compliment that can be\r\npaid him is that he has satisfied the Sirdar.\"  Another paper said:\r\n\"General Gatacre is a keen soldier--a workman 's'il y en a.'  His idea\r\nof practising troops in the field during a campaign was an inspiration.\r\nThe conventional idea has been that in the field the only alternatives\r\nwere fighting and taking it easy.  Result when campaigning in a bad\r\nclimate, laziness in camp, rum, fever, and loss of condition generally.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter of congratulation from a Civil Service friend in India, we\r\nfind the following generous appreciation:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You yourself are becoming more famous every day, to the great delight\r\nof your friends and well-wishers; and I was proud to see that at the\r\nAtbara you gave them a touch of the same bravery and indifference to\r\ndanger that you delighted us with at the old club at Simla, when you\r\nrushed across the open and disarmed that Pathan servant who, after\r\nmurdering the cook's mate, was firing 'promiscuous,' while we all\r\nhuddled in the next block.  Do you remember?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of his former Chiefs on the Bombay side wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\nYou ought to have been a K.C.B. long ago, but you are all right now,\r\nand nothing can keep you back.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{214}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n1898-1899\r\n\r\nCOLCHESTER\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Festivities]\r\n\r\nOn November 15, 1898, the Honours Gazette for the recent campaign was\r\npublished, and Gatacre found himself a Knight Commander of the Bath.\r\nHaving also been awarded the Second Class of the Imperial Order of the\r\nMedjidieh by His Highness the Khedive, he was now in possession of two\r\nstars as well as two additional war medals.  He had the honour of\r\nreceiving his knighthood at the hands of Her Majesty Queen Victoria at\r\nWindsor on December 10, 1898.  Not long afterwards he received an\r\ninvitation to stay at Windsor Castle, and had the honour of dining with\r\nHer Majesty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1899]\r\n\r\nIn the following February it was notified that Her Majesty the Queen\r\nhad been graciously pleased to nominate Sir William as one of the\r\nofficers to receive a Reward for Distinguished and Meritorious Service.\r\n\r\nThe whole nation was delighted with the success of its representatives\r\nin Egypt, and as all hearts had been wrung by the tragedy of 1885, so\r\nnow all rejoiced with the victors of 1898.  A {215} unanimous vote of\r\nthanks was passed in both Houses of Parliament.  A large copy of these\r\ngratifying words printed on vellum and bound in red and green covers\r\nrespectively was presented to each of the senior officers named\r\ntherein.  These were forwarded through Lord Kitchener, who added a few\r\nwords endorsing the appreciation of Sir William's good work.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Mayor of London gave a dinner at the Guildhall in the Sirdar's\r\nhonour.  The Lord Provost of Edinburgh invited Lord Dufferin and Lord\r\nKitchener to accept the Freedom of that ancient city.  Edinburgh had\r\nreason to feel a special interest in the campaign, for one of the\r\nbrigadiers was a Midlothian man and there had been two Highland\r\nregiments in his command.  Lord Dufferin was especially pleased to see\r\nGatacre again, for as Viceroy of India he remembered him well while\r\nserving on the Headquarters Staff.\r\n\r\nThere were also two gala days when the General was the central figure;\r\nfor his native county of Shropshire was very proud of her son.  On\r\nDecember 15 Sir William was enrolled a Freeman of the City of\r\nShrewsbury with much acclamation and many kindly speeches.  The county\r\ntown of Bridgnorth also entertained him handsomely, and reminded him\r\nthat he had signed their roll in the year 1860.  Sir William was not a\r\npretentious speaker, but when called upon for a speech on such\r\noccasions his ideas were simple and his words fluent and appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe appointment he had held at Aldershot {216} having been cancelled on\r\nhis departure for Egypt, the General found himself unemployed for a\r\ntime after his return, but at the end of October he was informally\r\ninvited to say whether the Poona First-class District in India or the\r\ncommand of the Eastern District with Headquarters at Colchester would\r\nbe the more agreeable to him.  It was without hesitation that he chose\r\nthe latter.  From August 1880, when he left Dover with his regiment, to\r\nAugust 1897, when he had returned to take over his brigade at\r\nAldershot, he had served continuously in India, while (with a short\r\ninterval of five months) he had been working in the tropics for a\r\nfurther ten months.  He had now nearly completed thirty-seven years'\r\nservice, of which twenty-three had been spent in India.  There was\r\ntherefore to him a most attractive novelty about serving at home, and\r\nthe independent provincial command that was offered to him would, he\r\nknew, in many ways prove most congenial.  He took over the command from\r\nGeneral Burnett on December 8, 1898, and went into residence at\r\nColchester the next day.\r\n\r\nThe Eastern District at that time included the nine counties which lie\r\nbetween Norfolk and London, and between Nottingham and the sea.  The\r\nGeneral Officer Commanding was directly responsible to the War Office\r\nfor the troops of all arms, regular, militia, and volunteers, within\r\nthis area.  During the training season the work was very heavy and\r\nnecessitated a great deal of touring.  His previous experience in\r\nBombay {217} had given the General a special interest in coast defence,\r\nand it was therefore with pleasure that he again found himself in\r\ncommand of a long sea-board.\r\n\r\nIn the last year of his command, 1903, the Army Reorganisation scheme\r\nslightly changed his official position, but this was purely technical,\r\nand only affected his last six months there.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In Sussex]\r\n\r\nOccasionally Sir William was called upon to take part in the training\r\noutside his own district.  Early in the year 1899 he was detailed to\r\nconduct one side of a staff-ride that took place in Sussex.  An\r\nimaginary Blue Force was supposed to be concentrated at Eastbourne,\r\nwhile the Defence held the heights to the north of Ashdown Forest.  The\r\nwild and picturesque district over which the operations were conducted\r\nadded immensely to Gatacre's pleasure in the trip; he wrote with\r\nenthusiasm of the miles of heather-land, and had in the end the further\r\nsatisfaction of finding that, as the Blue Invader, he had defeated his\r\nRed Opponent by a night-march on Dorking.\r\n\r\nAmong other events of the London season Sir William was present at the\r\nRoyal Academy Dinner.  Invitations to all sorts of public functions and\r\ncity dinners followed throughout the summer.  As the journey from\r\nColchester only occupies one hour, it was possible for him to enjoy all\r\nsuch London diversions without in any way neglecting his professional\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nFurther evidence of his enhanced reputation was afforded by his\r\nselection to command a Division on Salisbury Plain in the forthcoming\r\n{218} manoeuvres.  Two Divisions were organised, under the general\r\ndirection of Sir Charles Mansfield Clarke.  One had its headquarters at\r\nPerham Down and was commanded by Sir Leslie Rundle, the other by\r\nGatacre with headquarters on the Downs above Bulford.  This latter\r\nDivision consisted of two brigades under Colonel Ian Hamilton and\r\nColonel Clements; the staff remained in camp throughout the ten weeks'\r\ntraining, but the troops (which included units from the militia and\r\nvolunteers as well as the regular army) took part in the training for\r\ntwo or three weeks only.  This was the first occasion on which khaki\r\nuniform was worn in England; a certain battalion having recently\r\nreturned from abroad, came into camp as it was, before refitting with\r\nhome clothing.  The camp lasted from June 25 to September 3; at the end\r\nSir William wrote that his stay had been most instructive, and that Sir\r\nCharles Mansfield Clarke had expressed himself as much pleased with all\r\nthat had been done.\r\n\r\nThroughout this summer the situation in South Africa, so far as it\r\ncould be known through the daily papers, was giving rise to great\r\nanxiety, and the probability of an outbreak of hostilities before very\r\nlong became more and more apparent.  Early in October Gatacre was\r\nwarned that in the event of an Army Corps proceeding to South Africa he\r\nhad been selected for the post of Lieutenant-General commanding the\r\nThird Division.  Sir George White had only a week before started to\r\ntake command of the forces in {219} Natal, and had borrowed Gatacre's\r\nA.D.C.; and at the same time the 6th Company Army Service Corps had\r\nbeen sent off from Colchester to the Cape.\r\n\r\nBefore the middle of the month Sir William's appointment and the\r\ndetails of his command were gazetted, and he received orders to sail on\r\nthe Union-Castle Line mail steamer _Moor_ on Saturday, October 21, from\r\nSouthampton.  His departure from Colchester was fixed for Friday the\r\n20th.  Although it was scarcely ten months since he had been resident\r\nin the district, the General had, as usual, become very popular with\r\nall classes.  The Mayor and Corporation insisted on being given an\r\nopportunity of expressing their congratulations and good wishes.\r\n\r\n\"The Council,\" they said, \"felt that they were parting not only with a\r\ndistinguished officer and an ornament to Her Majesty's service, but\r\nwith a brother citizen.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Off to the Cape]\r\n\r\nCrowds of friends were assembled on the platform that Friday afternoon,\r\nevery officer of the garrison was there in uniform, and there were many\r\npersons who had come in by train to cry \"God-speed,\" for not a few had\r\nhusbands, sons, and brothers already at the front.  Many people at that\r\ntime thought that the war would be a very short affair after the\r\narrival of the reinforcements, and it was in this spirit that a lady in\r\nher farewell greeting said: \"Good-bye, General--good luck to you; but I\r\nfear it will all be over before you get out.\"  To which the General\r\nreplied so gravely that she felt reproved: {220} \"Make no mistake.  We\r\nhave a long tough job before us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the evening papers that same day the news of the battle of Talana\r\nHill was published.  This was the first conflict of the three years'\r\nwar, and very naturally the account of it added fervour to the public\r\ninterest in the official departures.  Two troopships were leaving\r\nSouthampton that Saturday as well as the Union-Castle liner which was\r\nto carry Sir Redvers Buller and his three divisional commanders.  The\r\npublic knew by what train the officers would travel, and both at\r\nWaterloo and at Southampton the popular enthusiasm was expressed with\r\nextraordinary vehemence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{221}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n1899\r\n\r\nCAPE COLONY\r\n\r\nIt was with great reluctance that Sir Redvers Buller had been persuaded\r\nto give any forecast to the War Office in London of the disposition of\r\ntroops he intended to make on reaching Capetown.  But whatever these\r\nmay have been, he found on his arrival that the situation had so\r\nmaterially changed that he had to rearrange his plans to suit the\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nThe Boers were bringing so much pressure to bear on Ladysmith, where\r\nSir George White had established his headquarters, and on Kimberley,\r\nthat he decided to send the First Division under Lord Methuen to the\r\nrelief of the latter place, and to employ in Natal the Second Division\r\nand the two brigades of which the Third Division had been originally\r\ncomposed.  It seemed at the same time so important to reassure the\r\nloyal colonists in Eastern Cape Colony that he sent Gatacre there with\r\none battalion of infantry and a promise of speedy reinforcements.\r\n\r\nWriting on board ship between Capetown and {222} East London, on\r\nNovember 16, Sir William says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am ordered to go to East London, and take command of the district up\r\nto Bethulie Bridge.  Now, what does this mean?  Why, that with the\r\nRoyal Irish Rifles, which has never been on service before, together\r\nwith half-battalion Berkshire Regiment, and a few Volunteers, I become\r\nresponsible for the railway line and adjacent country up to the Orange\r\nRiver, about 200 miles long--but the last 100 miles are much\r\ndisaffected.  I have no definite orders, except that I am to hold\r\nQueenstown if possible, but East London at any rate, and am to raise as\r\nmany Volunteers as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the General reached East London he found that it could be left\r\nunder the care of a local Volunteer Corps, and so he proceeded by train\r\nto Queenstown the same day.  Here he found the half-battalion named\r\nabove, a small detachment of Royal Garrison Artillery, and half a\r\ncompany of Royal Engineers.  Besides these regular troops there were\r\n229 men of the Frontier Mounted Rifles, and 285 of the Queenstown Rifle\r\nVolunteers.\r\n\r\nSir Redvers Buller, who was the General Commanding-in-Chief, chose\r\nNatal for his headquarters.  Sir F. Forestier-Walker was in command of\r\nthe Lines of Communication, with headquarters at Capetown.  Sometimes\r\nSir Redvers sent his messages direct to Gatacre, and sometimes they\r\ncame through Capetown.  There was no friction and no contradiction,\r\n{223} but it may well have been that this duplication of important\r\ntelegrams created an atmosphere of unrest and added poignancy to\r\nGatacre's feeling of helplessness.\r\n\r\nOn November 18 a telegram was received from Sir Redvers Buller,\r\npointing out that \"the great thing in this sort of warfare is to be\r\npretty certain that one position is safe before you advance to another,\r\nand that we are not yet strong enough to play tricks.\"[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See _Official History of the War in South Africa_, 1899-1902, vol.\r\ni. pp. 286, 287.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conflicting messages]\r\n\r\nThree days, later, however, the General Commanding-in-Chief strikes a\r\ndifferent note:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I calculate it will be at least five days and probably a week before I\r\nhave a second battalion to send you, or a battery of field artillery,\r\nbut I am anxious to get into a position to protect the Indwe mines\r\nbetter than we do.  Do you think it would be safe for you to advance\r\nyour force or part of it to Stormberg, and hold that instead of\r\nQueenstown?  I am told it is a good position for a force the size of\r\nyours.  Of course you will have no support.\"[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] From contemporary copy of telegram in W. F. G.'s own handwriting.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this Sir William replied that he had not sufficient men as yet to\r\nadvance on Stormberg, but as soon as more troops arrived he intended to\r\noccupy that junction and clear the country round it.\r\n\r\nAt the time this message was sent the Boers had not yet crossed the\r\nOrange River {224} in strength, but by November 5 they had occupied\r\nAliwal North and Stormberg, and were advancing on Dordrecht.  The first\r\nis an important town on the Orange River, near which there are good\r\nbridges, both for the road and the railway; the second is a railway\r\njunction fifty-five miles north-west of Queenstown, and Dordrecht is a\r\nsmall town only thirty-five miles from Queenstown to the north-east.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Invasion of Cape Colony: the Boers marching south over\r\nthe Orange River at Aliwal North.]\r\n\r\nOn hearing of the occupation of Dordrecht, Sir Redvers grew anxious\r\nlest his former suggestion should be taken too seriously, and\r\ntelegraphed to Sir F. Forestier-Walker:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Caution Gatacre to be careful.  I think he is hardly strong enough to\r\nadvance beyond Putters Kraal before Methuen's return.\"[3]\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] See _Official History_, vol. i. p. 288.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd on the following day he added instructions to reinforce Gatacre by\r\none, or if possible two battalions, and \"any mounted men that can be\r\nspared.\"[4]\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nWriting on November 24, Sir William says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have not yet got any more troops, but am hoping for some directly.\r\nFancy what a predicament for a General Officer to be in--no troops, no\r\ntransport, no horses for his Mounted Infantry; but I trust all are\r\ncoming.  The only unfortunate thing is that our people in front,\r\npolice, civilian officers, etc., are obliged to fall back for want of\r\nsupport.  I have been over a good deal of country the last few days,\r\nround our outposts, and am delighted with it.  It is fine and open, and\r\nthe farmers are a nice set of people.  The sun is hot, but nothing like\r\nIndia: {225} one can ride in it all day without inconvenience, and it\r\nhardly ever gives you sunstroke.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An anxious time]\r\n\r\nAnd again on the 28th:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have had a terribly anxious time the last two days, the Boers\r\nwrecking everything in my front, and no troops to drive them out.  I am\r\nthankful to say that I hear to-day that a regiment, the 2nd\r\nNorthumberland Fusiliers, is arriving here to-morrow, ... and so I\r\nshall be able to make some kind of show--but I am still badly off for\r\neverything.  I am still praying for artillery, hospitals, etc.  The\r\nwhole country is seething with rebellion, and to put it down we require\r\na lot of men.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately after the arrival of this reinforcement, Gatacre advanced\r\nhis Headquarters to Putters Kraal, twenty-five miles up the railway,\r\nand placed outposts at Sterkstroom, Bushman's Hoek, and Penhoek.  The\r\ncross railway line running from Stormberg westwards through Rosmead to\r\nNaauwpoort was soon afterwards destroyed by the enemy, thus putting a\r\nstop to any combined action between Sir William and Sir John French,\r\nwho was defending a parallel railway which runs up from Port Elizabeth\r\nthrough Naauwpoort and Colesberg to Bloemfontein.\r\n\r\nOn November 30 Sir William writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I fear this is a grumbling letter, but I am in a miserable state of\r\ninefficiency.  I have only two regiments (one joined yesterday).  We\r\nhave waggons but no harness, and only {226} half the mules to draw\r\nthem--and are within a few miles of the enemy.  I have orders to raise\r\nMounted Volunteers, but have no saddlery, no equipment, no clothing to\r\nsupply them with: it would be laughable if it were not lamentable and\r\nserious....\r\n\r\n\"The worst point about the whole thing is that I can hear nothing of\r\nany more troops coming to me, that the Boers are eating up the country\r\nin our front, and forcing the farmers to join them, because I cannot\r\nmove: and consequently they are getting stronger every day.  I assure\r\nyou that I am perfectly sick at such a display of inefficiency,\r\nunpreparedness, and apathy.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday I made a dash out to Molteno, some sixteen miles ahead of my\r\npresent position, and seized some 7,000 bags of food, meal, etc., and\r\nbrought it in on some trains which I took out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, December 2, Sir William sent the following message to Sir\r\nRedvers Buller:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Military situation here requires dealing with extreme carefulness.\r\nBoers have occupied Dordrecht, and enemy is advancing in a southerly\r\ndirection, evidently pointing for Queenstown.  I have two British\r\nregiments only, and I am thirty-three miles to the north of Queenstown.\r\nI am holding Bushman's Hoek range, to endeavour to prevent descent into\r\nQueenstown district, which would mean general state of rebellion of\r\nDutch.  Force will be strengthened at Queenstown by next British\r\nregiment, which should arrive at Queenstown December 5, but Queenstown\r\nis indefensible position.  Are there any orders, especially as regards\r\nmy movements?\"[5]\r\n\r\n\r\n[5] See _Official History_, vol. i. p. 288.\r\n\r\n\r\n{227} To which this reply was returned:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We have to make the best of the situation, and if the enemy is\r\nadvancing by Dordrecht, the importance of Bushman's Hoek is diminished.\r\nYou have a force which altogether is considerably stronger than the\r\nenemy can now bring against you.  Cannot you close with him, or else\r\noccupy a defensible position which will obstruct his advance?  You have\r\nan absolutely free hand to do what you think best.\"[6]\r\n\r\n\r\n[6] See _Official History_, vol. i. p. 288.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Night attack suggested]\r\n\r\nOn the following day the message given below reached Gatacre through\r\nSir F. Forestier-Walker:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"General Buller inquires whether you can safely leave your present\r\nposition and advance to Henning's Station, or somewhere near where you\r\ncan get a safe position, and also institute a policy of worry.  He\r\nthinks if you could occupy Henning's Station Boers would fall back on\r\nBurghersdorp, or if you could get near enough to Burghersdorp to make\r\nnight attack, it would be the thing to stop anxiety (_sic_).  He adds\r\nHildyard with a battalion and half sent a column of seven thousand\r\nBoers under Joubert himself flying.  The above was probably wired\r\nbefore Buller read notification of the enemy's occupation of Dordrecht.\r\nHe wired last night as follows: tell Gatacre he will have to take care\r\nof himself till 5th Division arrives.  A telegram just received says he\r\nhas given you a free hand.\"[7]\r\n\r\n\r\n[7] From copy of telegram in A.D.C.'s handwriting.\r\n\r\n\r\nBurghersdorp is about twenty-three miles north of Stormberg, and\r\nHenning is a station about ten miles west of Stormberg on the cross\r\n{228} line.  This telegram, therefore, sketched a far more arduous and\r\nhazardous enterprise than that which Gatacre afterwards attempted.\r\n\r\nWithin the next few days the Third Division was strengthened by the\r\narrival of the 74th and 77th Batteries Royal Field Artillery, the First\r\nBattalion Royal Scots, the 33rd Company Army Service Corps, and the\r\n16th Field Hospital.  All these units were only just arrived from\r\nEngland, so that, although the additional battalion of infantry was\r\nvery valuable, Gatacre was unable to employ the men on the raid that he\r\nhad been planning for some time past.  They would serve, however, to\r\nprotect the camp, and would thus set the other two battalions free for\r\nuse as a striking force.  Even these had only been two and three weeks\r\nin the country respectively, and the General had had no opportunity of\r\ngetting them into the hard condition and fighting form that was reached\r\nby his Brigade on the Nile.\r\n\r\nOn December 8 he writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am frightfully busy and worried.  The whole of this country is\r\nseething with rebels, and as they are all mounted, and I have only a\r\nfew mounted infantry on half-fed ponies, it is very difficult to cope\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n\"I have now three regiments of infantry, but have a long railway line\r\nto guard, and every culvert has a couple of armed men in it.  Fancy\r\nwhat an anxiety this is--their safety, their food, their overworked\r\ncondition.  If I had my Division I could really strike somewhere....\r\n\r\n\"I am hoping to move on a bit to-morrow or next day to recover some of\r\nthe country given {229} up prior to my arrival, as I think occupation\r\nof a position in advance of this may tend to awe the Dutch behind me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the _Official History_ we read that--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The General Officer Commanding considered that, in the existing\r\nstrategic situation, any further prolongation of the defensive attitude\r\nhe had hitherto been obliged to maintain would be injurious.  He\r\ndetermined, therefore, to take advantage of the free hand left to him\r\nby Sir Redvers Buller, and to follow the further suggestion that he\r\nshould close with the enemy.\"[8]\r\n\r\n\r\n[8] See _Official History_, vol. i. p. 289.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first week in December was spent in reconnoitring the Stormberg\r\nposition so far as wandering parties of Boers would permit.  The\r\ngeneral himself prepared a sketch of the hills surrounding it and the\r\nroads leading thereto, which he carried with him on the march.  The\r\nonly map available was on too small a scale (twelve and a half miles to\r\nthe inch) to be useful for tactical purposes, but all possible\r\ninformation was extracted from every man acquainted with the locality.\r\nTheir accounts of the features and the distances were often inexact,\r\nand did not always agree, but eventually five local men, belonging to\r\nthe Cape Mounted Police, under Sergeant Morgan of the same corps, were\r\nselected as guides.\r\n\r\nThe General's scheme was to attack the Boer laager on the Stormberg\r\nNek; by a night march of nine miles from Molteno he hoped to reach a\r\n{230} position from which the enemy's camp could be assaulted at\r\ndaybreak.\r\n\r\nThe concentration was made at Molteno, on the afternoon of December 9,\r\nthe troops being brought from Putters Kraal by train, about sixteen\r\nmiles, and some from Bushman's Hoet, which was half the distance.  The\r\nforce consisted of the two field batteries, with an escort of Mounted\r\nInfantry and two Infantry Battalions.  It should have been further\r\naugmented by the detachment from Penhoek of 235 Cape Mounted Rifles,\r\nbut, owing to the miscarriage of a telegram, these men failed to appear.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance that modified the original plan was a report that\r\nwas brought in at the last minute that the enemy had fortified and\r\nentrenched the pass between the Kissieberg and Rooi Kop, over which\r\nruns the main road and the railway to the junction.  The informant\r\naffirmed that the Boer main laager was placed on the heights of the\r\nKissieberg, which could be easily ascended from the western side, where\r\nthere were no artificial defences.  The General was assured by all\r\nthose who should have known that to reach this hill on its western\r\nflank would only add two miles to the projected march, and that they\r\ncould lead him to a favourable spot for such an attempt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The start]\r\n\r\nA council was held in the station-master's room at Molteno, and all the\r\ncommanding officers were consulted as to their men's condition and\r\nfitness for the expedition.  Although the train service had been most\r\ncarefully timed, a {231} delay of two hours had somehow crept in; the\r\nrailway was but a single line and the siding accommodation very\r\nlimited.  However, no one foresaw any difficulty, and so the start was\r\nmade at nine o'clock that evening by moonlight.  Indeed, so eager were\r\nthe men that they set out at an unusually brisk pace.\r\n\r\nIn the General's official report we read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The force marched, with the usual halts, for about eight miles by\r\nmoonlight, and halted near Roberts's farm at 12.30.  The chief guide\r\nnow reported that we were within one and a half miles of the enemy's\r\nposition, and, after a rest of about three-quarters of an hour, we\r\nmarched off again in the dark.\"[9]\r\n\r\n\r\n[9] See _Despatches_ published March 17, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was soon after this halt that the General realised that the guides\r\nhad not brought him along the road that he had indicated, but, as he\r\nwrote, to turn back in consequence of this discovery did not commend\r\nitself to him.  So the men tramped on, and at 4.20 a.m. found\r\nthemselves under a face of the Kissieberg.  A single shot from a Boer\r\npicket precipitated the attack, and before long the enemy had located\r\nthe British column.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Three companies of the Royal Irish Rifles formed to the left, and\r\noccupied a kopje; the remainder of this battalion and the\r\nNorthumberland Fusiliers advanced up a steep hill against the enemy's\r\nposition.\"[10]\r\n\r\n\r\n[10] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There was no good position for the British {232} guns, except the\r\nridge 2,000 yards to the west of the Kissieberg.  But the infantry's\r\nneed of immediate support was too pressing to allow time for that\r\nridge's occupation.  Lieutenant-Colonel Jeffreys, by direction of\r\nGeneral Gatacre, caused the 77th Battery to come into action near the\r\nkopje, the 74th unlimbering in the open veldt to the westward.  The\r\nMounted Infantry continued to escort the batteries....\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A fatal mischance]\r\n\r\n\"The Boers from the main laager had now manned the hill, but the\r\nBritish artillery was bursting shells on the threatened crest, and a\r\nBoer gun, which had come into action, was for a time silenced.\r\n\r\n\"The attack had lasted half an hour, and progress up the hill was being\r\nslowly made by the British infantry, when five companies of the\r\nNorthumberlands, on the right of the line, were ordered to retire by\r\ntheir commanding officer.  He considered that his battalion must leave\r\nthe hill.  The three foremost companies, who were nearly on the summit,\r\ndid not hear this order, and, under the command of Captain Wilmott,\r\nremained with the Irish Rifles, clinging on as they were.  The fire of\r\nthe enemy appeared to be slackening, and for the moment the groups of\r\nBritish officers were convinced that, if they were supported, they\r\ncould gain the crest.  But the withdrawal of a portion of the attacking\r\nline had made further success impossible.  Nor was that all.  Seeing\r\nthe five companies of the Northumberland Fusiliers falling back to the\r\nwest, the batteries conceived that all the assailants were retreating,\r\nand exerted themselves to the utmost to cover the movement by their\r\nfire.  The sun was now rising behind the western face of the\r\nKissieberg, so that all the upper part presented to the British guns a\r\nblack target, on {233} which neither friend nor foe could be\r\ndistinguished.  Thus a fatal mischance came about.  A shell fused for\r\nexplosion just short of the Boer defensive line burst over the foremost\r\ngroup of the Irish Rifles, and struck down Lieutenant-Colonel Eager,\r\nMajor H. J. Seton, the second-in-command, Major Welman, Captain Bell,\r\nand three men.  A conference had a few moments before been held between\r\nColonel Eager and Captain Wilmott, as to the steps which should be\r\ntaken to protect the men from the shells of their own gunners.  The\r\nformer officer had stated that as the situation of the infantry was\r\nevidently unknown to the batteries, and was masking their fire, it was\r\nnecessary to fall back.  Captain Wilmott, on the other hand, urged that\r\nif the men were once ordered to withdraw, it would be very difficult to\r\nget them up the hill again.  Colonel Eager replied that there was no\r\nhelp for it.  Therefore a general retirement now began.\"[11]\r\n\r\n\r\n[11] See _Official History_, vol. i. pp. 297-8.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn officer of the Royal Irish Rifles writes in his official report:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"At this time I did not think there was more than a piquet in front,\r\nand a rush at the end of the kopje would have taken that part of the\r\nposition and the Boer gun.  Colonel Eager, Major Seton, Major Welman,\r\nand Captain Bell were knocked over at this point by one of our shells,\r\notherwise I think they would have taken this portion of the Boer\r\nposition.  From subsequent conversation with one Voss, Secretary to\r\nSwanepoel, Commandant Smithfield Laager there is no doubt that many of\r\nthe Boers were leaving the position.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n{234}\r\n\r\nIt seems, therefore, clear that the day was almost won, for had our\r\nshells fallen a little farther forward, so that the infantry could have\r\nheld on a quarter of an hour longer, they would doubtless have found\r\nthe defences evacuated.  If our victorious troops had been able to eat\r\nthe enemy's breakfast, we should have heard nothing of the fatigues of\r\nthe night march, nor of the missing telegram.\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately, the morning ended differently.  We will close the\r\naccount with a quotation from a letter written by one of the\r\naides-de-camp:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The General, as soon as he realised the state of things, arranged for\r\nthe retirement, quite cool under the hottest fire, encouraging the men\r\nand moving over the position in every direction, not recklessly, but\r\nwith a fine courage, which did us all good to watch.  The retirement\r\nwas carried out in wonderful order, and, weary though the men were,\r\nthey hastened to join their units, and marched home in fair order....\r\nThroughout the retirement he was the last man of the column, beating up\r\ntired stragglers, and bringing in abandoned transport.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all the accounts something is said about a secondary force of Boers\r\nthat came on to the scene soon after the general retirement had begun,\r\nbut according to the following extract from another officer's report,\r\nthey refrained from doing us as much damage as might have been effected\r\nby a more experienced enemy.\r\n\r\n{235}\r\n\r\n\"Just as we were moving off about 400 Boers appeared on the high\r\nplateau on our right flank from the Steynsburg direction, but were at\r\nonce checked by the fire of our guns, and gave the infantry no further\r\ntrouble.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe advanced troops got back to Molteno at 11 a.m., and all were in by\r\n12.30.  The casualties were officially returned as eight officers\r\nwounded (one died of wounds) and thirteen missing; in other ranks there\r\nwere 25 killed, 102 wounded, and 548 missing.  The whole force employed\r\namounted to 3,035 of all ranks.\r\n\r\nThe main facts of this account are taken from the _History of the War\r\nin South Africa_ recently published.  So little is said in the\r\nGeneral's despatch of the part played by the infantry that this\r\nomission is a subject of comment in Lord Roberts's covering letter of\r\nFebruary 1900.[12]  It may therefore be concluded that the\r\nField-Marshal (who was commanding the forces in Ireland at the time\r\nthat the engagement was fought) was at the time of writing ignorant of\r\nmany incidents that have since been brought to light.\r\n\r\n\r\n[12] See _Despatches_ published March 17, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: With an ace]\r\n\r\nIn Sir William's letter three days later he speaks of the action as \"a\r\nmost lamentable failure, and yet within an ace of being the success I\r\nanticipated,\" and goes on:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The fault was mine, as I was responsible of course.  I went rather\r\nagainst my better judgment in not resting the night at Molteno, but I\r\n{236} was tempted by the shortness of the distance and the certainty of\r\nsuccess.  It was so near being a brilliant success.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth in the articles published at the time, and in the _Official\r\nHistory_ referred to above, the circumstances in which Sir William was\r\nplaced are held to have made some demonstration imperative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sir William Gatacre's decision to advance on Stormberg was fully\r\njustified by the strategical situation.  General Buller's telegram,\r\nalthough it left him a free hand as to time and opportunity, had\r\nsuggested that operation.  The plan, though bold, was sound in its\r\ndesign, and would have succeeded had not exceptional misfortune\r\nattended its execution.\"[13]\r\n\r\n\r\n[13] See _Official History_, vol. i. pp. 301, 302.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following day, Monday, the battle of Magersfontein was fought on\r\nthe north-west, and on Friday of the same week Sir Redvers Buller\r\ndelivered his unsuccessful attack on Colenso.  Owing to the proximity\r\nof dates, the attempt to retake Stormberg is associated in the public\r\nmind with the other engagements of that week; but in the numbers\r\nemployed, in the losses suffered, and in political importance it\r\nshrinks into insignificance compared with them.  At Magersfontein, on\r\nDecember 11, 14,964 troops of all ranks were engaged, the total killed\r\nand wounded was returned as 885, with 63 missing; at Colenso, out of\r\n19,378 men, the losses were 899, with 240 missing; while at Stormberg,\r\nout {237} of 3,035 engaged, 135 were killed and wounded, and 571 taken\r\nprisoners.[14]  From a political point of view, though no ground was\r\ngained, still none was lost, and Sir William was actually able, the day\r\nafter, to establish his headquarters at Sterkstroom, which was five\r\nmiles farther up the railway than he had been at Putters Kraal.\r\n\r\n\r\n[14] See _Official History_, vol. i. app. vi. pp. 468, 469, 470.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the General Commanding-in-Chief Sir William received the following\r\ntelegram:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Your telegram respecting your action and dispositions, I think you\r\nwere quite right to try the night attack and hope better luck next\r\ntime.  I don't think you will find them attack you when in position,\r\nbut it would be better to retire than run the risk of being surrounded;\r\nas to this you must judge for yourself, but military considerations\r\nshould be held paramount.--BULLER.\"[15]\r\n\r\n\r\n[15] See original text.  From Frere Camp, 2.17 p.m.; reached\r\nSterkstroom 4.4 p.m., December 11, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\nWriting on December 18, Sir William says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have now three regiments--the Derbyshire, Royal Scots, and Royal\r\nIrish Rifles.  I have been obliged to send the Northumberland Fusiliers\r\nto East London to look after the base, as Sir Redvers Buller wished\r\nthis done.  My Howitzer Battery he has been obliged to send to Natal to\r\nassist Clery.\r\n\r\n\"I have up here (Sterkstroom) a large camp with supplies, stores, etc.,\r\nand have been ordered by Buller to entrench and endeavour with my\r\nmounted troops to harry the district round me, but I have so few\r\ntrained troops, and these Boers {238} are so mobile (all mounted) that\r\nit is a very difficult matter to catch them.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\"You must not expect to see much movement from my force: I have no\r\nstrength--cannot leave my line of communications, which are long.  All\r\nthe districts behind me are ready to rise, and I cannot separate my\r\nregiments.  I have received orders to entrench my camp, and this I am\r\nabout to do.  This will, of course, free my mounted men a bit, as the\r\npost, with provisions, will be safe for them to come back to.  As I am\r\nwriting I hear of a threatened rising in Alice and Seymour, two\r\ndistricts south-west of Stutterheim, right away behind me, which makes\r\nit difficult for me to retain my communications with the coast.  These\r\nmay be exaggerated reports, but I have had so many warnings that one\r\ncannot afford to disregard them.  You may rest assured we shall fight\r\nto the end anyhow, and my thoughts will be with you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{239}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n1900\r\n\r\nORANGE FREE STATE\r\n\r\nThe anxiety felt by the commanders of the three detached forces in\r\nSouth Africa was shared by the nation at home.  The telegrams sent to\r\nEngland by Sir Redvers Buller showed that the state of affairs in Natal\r\nafter the battle of Colenso was very critical, and that only prompt and\r\nample reinforcements would be of any avail.  Troops of all arms were\r\ndespatched to Capetown as fast as ships could be got ready to carry\r\nthem, and Field-Marshal Lord Roberts was appointed Commander-in-Chief,\r\nwith Lord Kitchener as his chief staff officer.\r\n\r\nThe Field-Marshal reached Capetown on January 10.  Four weeks were\r\nnecessary for the organisation of his new army, which amounted to\r\n35,000 men when concentrated at Modder River on February 8.  A week\r\nlater General French at the head of a Cavalry Division rode into\r\nKimberley, and on the same day the Sixth Division got in touch with\r\nGeneral Cronje, and commenced the series of operations which led to his\r\nsurrender with all his army.  There {240} were yet, however, two\r\nserious engagements to be fought, at Poplar Grove and Driefontein,\r\nbefore the Commander-in-Chief entered Bloemfontein on Thursday, March\r\n15, 1900.  By that time this advance in force into the enemy's country\r\nhad had its effect in the east and south.  The pressure in Natal was\r\nrelaxed, and on March 1 Sir Redvers Buller rode into Ladysmith and\r\ngreeted Sir George White and his gallant garrison.  In the meantime\r\nGatacre and Clements had been holding on to the railways, impatient to\r\nmove forward as soon as it was safe to do so.  Both these columns,\r\nwhich had been marking time in the face of the enemy, had had\r\noccasional conflicts, but these were, for the most part, outpost\r\naffairs, or the result of reconnaissance.\r\n\r\nWriting from Sterkstroom on February 24, Sir William says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday we had a fight just north of Molteno, and unfortunately lost\r\nabout seventy men, but we gained the information we required.\r\nMontmorency is missing, and I fear he has been wounded or shot.  His\r\nparty got too far ahead of us, and it was with difficulty I extricated\r\nthem.  I was very nearly shot twice, once by a rifleman (Boer), once by\r\na shell--very near.  I have had marvellous luck on more than one\r\noccasion.  The men all behaved very well.  I do not think that people\r\nrealise quite the extent of the country I am covering.  From Karn Nek\r\nto Bird's River is thirty-five miles, and I have three and a half\r\nregiments only to do it with.  I think I told you that Brabant, a\r\nColonial, {241} had been given a command under me of mounted troops.\r\nHe has a very mixed lot, and their procedure is sketchy, but Lord\r\nRoberts wishes him to have a free hand.  He is to start to-day towards\r\nDordrecht, and I have told him what I want him to do, _i.e._ to cut in\r\nbetween Dordrecht and Jamestown, which I think should have the effect\r\nof making them fall back from Stormberg, in which case I could occupy\r\nit, but, as you see, I cannot occupy it without evacuating some place\r\nbehind me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Across the river]\r\n\r\nOn March 5 the Third Division reoccupied Stormberg; on the 6th they\r\nreached Burghersdorp; on the 9th the scouts chased the Boers to the\r\nbridge over the Orange River at Bethulie, and entrenched themselves on\r\nthe southern bank.  The little band arrived just in time to see the\r\nrailway bridge blown up, but their advance saved the roadway.\r\nLieutenant Popham, of the Derbyshire Regiment, promptly cut the\r\nelectric wire that would have fused the dynamite, and at night Sir\r\nWilliam, accompanied by Lieutenant Grant, R.E., crept along the\r\nparapet, and dropped the parcels of explosives into the river.  The\r\nscouts of the Third Division were rather proud of having saved this\r\nbridge, as at Norvals Pont both were destroyed.  The next day the\r\ncolumn occupied Bethulie in the enemy's country, and on the 15th took\r\npossession of the railway junction at Springfontein.  Colonel Clements\r\nhad also crossed the Orange River, and made his way on to the junction\r\nshortly after the Third Division had captured the place.\r\n\r\n{242}\r\n\r\n\"The deliberation of Gatacre's movements surprised his younger\r\nofficers, who did not know that the Divisional General had received\r\norders from the Commander-in-Chief not to commit himself seriously\r\nuntil reinforcements had reached him, and, if possible, to repair the\r\nrailway which connects Stormberg with Naauwpoort Junction.\"[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See _Official History_, vol. ii. p. 247.\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Clements had received orders in the same strain:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Do not attempt to force passage of river until you hear from me, or\r\nare certain that the enemy have considerably loosened their hold over\r\nthe heights on the north bank.  This they are sure to do when we reach\r\nBloemfontein, and it is better that the repair of the bridge be delayed\r\na few days than that lives be lost unnecessarily.\"[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] _Ibid._, vol. ii. p. 256.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 16 General Pole-Carew was sent down the line from Bloemfontein\r\nto meet Gatacre and Clements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He found at Edenburg that he had just missed Grobler's contingent\r\nproceeding north-east.  This was only the first of two parties escaping\r\nfrom Colesberg, the second being under Lemmer, while Du Plessis and\r\nOlivier were leading a third party in the same direction from Bethulie\r\nand Aliwal North.  When the three parties united in the neighbourhood\r\nof Ladybrand, they formed the imposing total of 5,500 Boers, 1,000\r\nKaffirs, 10,000 oxen and 800 waggons, covering a total extent of\r\ntwenty-four miles on the march.\r\n\r\n{243}\r\n\r\n\"As soon as Pole-Carew heard of Grobler's movements on the 16th, he\r\nurged upon the Commander-in-Chief the advisability of sending out a\r\nstrong force east of Bloemfontein, to intercept the Boer commandoes as\r\nthey came up from the south, and of bringing Brabant from Aliwal North\r\nand Gatacre from Springfontein to close in upon their rear.\"[3]\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] See _Times History_, vol. iv. p. 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A pacific policy]\r\n\r\nThe Field-Marshal was not, however, ready to undertake such an\r\nextensive movement; his force had only reached its goal the day before,\r\nand neither his men nor his horses would have been equal to such a\r\nchase.  Moreover the situation presented itself to him in quite a\r\ndifferent light.  The ready submission of the Boer farmers in the\r\nvicinity of the main army led him to exaggerate the effect on the\r\nnation at large of the capture of General Cronje and his four thousand\r\nfighting men.  He was led to believe by reports from various outlying\r\ndistricts that there was no fight left in the Boers, and in his desire\r\nto win them without unnecessary blood-shed he decided to try a policy\r\nof pacification.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival at Bloemfontein Lord Roberts issued a Proclamation by\r\nwhich, in the name of Her Majesty the Queen, he offered pardon and\r\nprotection to all such burghers as would lay down their arms and swear\r\nan oath of allegiance.[4]  A week later he telegraphed to the War\r\nOffice:\r\n\r\n\r\n[4] For words of Proclamation see _Official History_, vol. ii. p. 260.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"So many burghers have expressed their {244} desire to surrender under\r\nthe terms of the last proclamation that I have sent small columns in\r\nvarious directions to register the names and to take over arms.\"[5]\r\n\r\n\r\n[5] See _Times History_, vol. iv. p. 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this policy the Field-Marshal on March 19 telegraphed\r\nthe following order to Sir William Gatacre, whose headquarters were at\r\nSpringfontein:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Could you manage to take a small force, say two battalions, one\r\nbattery, and some mounted infantry, as far as Smithfield?  It is very\r\ndesirable British troops should be seen all over the country and\r\nopportunity given to burghers to surrender and deliver up their arms\r\nunder the conditions of the Proclamation of March 15.\"[6]\r\n\r\n\r\n[6] See _Official History_, vol. ii. p. 301.\r\n\r\n\r\nGatacre's command at this time had increased to four battalions of\r\ninfantry, with such mounted infantry as he had been able to raise from\r\ntheir ranks, and this Brigade was now employed as line-of-communication\r\ntroops.  Two battalions were needed at Bethulie Bridge, where the men's\r\nassistance was required in passing stores, etc., over the road-bridge\r\nuntil the railway should be repaired; from the other two he had to\r\nsupply guards for 115 miles of railway from Bethulie to Bloemfontein.\r\nThe Colonial section of his force was acting more or less independently\r\nunder General Brabant, who had established his headquarters at Aliwal\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\n{245}\r\n\r\nTo the telegram given above Gatacre replied that he could not spare\r\nmore than one battalion (the 2nd Royal Irish Rifles), a field battery,\r\na company of the mounted infantry of the Royal Scots and a section of\r\nthat of the Royal Irish Rifles.  His suggested reduction was approved,\r\nand the column started on its fifty-mile march to Smithfield on the\r\n20th.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st Sir William rode about twenty miles west of the railway to\r\nPhilipolis, where he took over the keys from the Landrost without\r\nopposition, returning the same evening to Springfontein.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand Sir William's part in the affairs of the next\r\nten days, it will be necessary to follow in detail the messages that\r\npassed daily between the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief and the\r\nDivisional General.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Troops sent to Wepener]\r\n\r\nOn Monday, March 26, instructions were received directing that two\r\nsquadrons of Brabant's Mounted Colonials from Aliwal North, together\r\nwith the mounted infantry company of the Royal Scots already at\r\nSmithfield, should push on to Wepener, which lies fifty miles to the\r\nnorth-east of Smithfield.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 27th, the 1st Derbyshire Regiment and the 11th Brigade\r\nDivision of the Royal Field Artillery were called up to complete a\r\nDivision at headquarters, thus reducing Gatacre's small force by about\r\n1,000 men.\r\n\r\nOn the same day Sir William telegraphed to Headquarters reporting a\r\nrumoured concentration of the enemy at Modder Poort, expressing {246}\r\nhis anxiety for the detachment that was marching on Wepener, and\r\nsuggesting that he should reinforce the column.  In reply he was\r\ninformed that the Field-Marshal did not anticipate danger at Wepener,\r\nbut that he concurred in the strengthening of the party there.\r\n\r\nOn March 28 the following telegram was received from Headquarters:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If you have enough troops at your disposal, I should wish you to\r\noccupy Dewetsdorp will make road from here to Maseru safe preventing\r\nenemy's forces from using telegraph lines to the south let me know what\r\nyou can do to this ends.\"[7]\r\n\r\n\r\n[7] From _True Copy_, furnished by D.A.A.G. in 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow there are two versions of this telegram.  The above is the version\r\nas it was received by General Gatacre at 9.40 a.m. on March 28.\r\nBetween the words \"_Dewetsdorp_\" and \"will\" he mentally supplied the\r\nword \"_I_\" to fill in the sense.  When, however, this important\r\ntelegram was quoted by Lord Roberts in a despatch to the War Office\r\n(dated April 16, 1900), the following verbal variations occur.  We find\r\n\"_I should like_\" for \"_I should wish_\"; the words \"_it would_\" take\r\nthe place of \"_will_\"; \"_and prevent enemy_\" stands for \"_preventing\r\nenemy's forces_\"; and the last word \"_ends_\" appears in the singular,\r\nthus bringing it into the body of the message.[8]  These differences\r\nwill seem trifling to the reader, but the meaning of this telegram has\r\nsince been questioned.  Gatacre {247} read it as an order to send a\r\ndetachment to Dewetsdorp similar to the one already ordered to Wepener,\r\nand the writer of the _Official History_ so reads it, even in the\r\nsecondary form.[9]\r\n\r\n\r\n[8] See _Official History_, vol. ii. app. vii. p. 614.\r\n\r\n[9] See marginal note, _Official History_, vol. ii. p. 302.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Detachments]\r\n\r\nDewetsdorp lies on the main road that runs from Bloemfontein south-east\r\nthrough Wepener into Basutoland; the distance from the capital to\r\nDewetsdorp is forty miles, and it is twenty-five miles on to Wepener.\r\nA detachment sent there was therefore in far less danger than the post\r\nat Wepener, and was a source of strength to the latter.  It was also\r\nknown to Gatacre that General French was operating with a mounted force\r\nat Thaba'Nchu, so that he naturally concluded that the road\r\nBloemfontein--Thaba'Nchu--Ladybrand, or Maseru, was strongly held.  As\r\nhe himself said in evidence before the Royal Commission, he \"never sent\r\nthem [the troops] there as an outpost, nor expected them to act as\r\nsuch, but merely to hold a post on an interior road.\"[10]\r\n\r\n\r\n[10] See _Report South African War Commission_, vol. iii. p. 276.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the same day, March 28, Gatacre sent this reply to the disputed\r\ntelegram:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Following moves are in progress, in view to covering whole country\r\neast of railway.\r\n\r\n\"Three squadrons Brabant's Horse moving Rouxville to Wepener; two will\r\nreach Wepener Sunday next (April 1), the third on Tuesday.\r\n\r\n\"One squadron Brabant's is moving to Bushman's Kop half-way between\r\nRouxville and Wepener.\r\n\r\n{248}\r\n\r\n\"One company Royal Scots Mounted Infantry reaches Wepener Sunday.\r\n\r\n\"Two companies 2nd Royal Irish, Rifles reach Dewetsdorp Sunday.\r\n\r\n\"One company Royal Irish Rifles and one section Mounted Infantry Royal\r\nIrish Rifles reach Helvetia to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\"Three companies Royal Irish Rifles at Smithfield with squadron\r\nBrabant's Horse.\"[11]\r\n\r\n\r\n[11] See Official History, vol. ii. p. 303.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Gatacre received no reply to the above message he assumed that his\r\ndispositions were approved.  In furtherance of Lord Roberts's wishes he\r\nslightly strengthened the post at Dewetsdorp next day by sending there\r\nsome mounted infantry of the Northumberland Fusiliers.  These changes\r\nwere also telegraphed to Headquarters.\r\n\r\nAlthough such detachment duty naturally fell to the Third Division as\r\nline-of-communication troops, still it would seem that the Headquarters\r\nStaff, in calling upon Gatacre to furnish these remote garrisons, had\r\noverlooked the fact that his _Division_ had never numbered more than\r\nfour infantry battalions, and had not at any time ever possessed any\r\ncavalry.  By thus scattering the few men at Gatacre's disposal, the\r\nCommander-in-Chief reduced the numbers available for guarding the\r\nhundred miles of railway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The railway was necessarily the first care; if that was seriously\r\nbroken, the army at Bloemfontein, if it did not actually starve, must\r\nbe injuriously affected.\"[12]\r\n\r\n\r\n[12] _Ibid._ vol. ii. p. 306\r\n\r\n\r\nThat this question of the adequate protection {249} of the railway line\r\nbecame a week later a great anxiety to Lord Roberts we know from his\r\nurgent telegram of April 5, in which he tells Gatacre to satisfy\r\nhimself that the guards are properly placed, sufficiently entrenched,\r\nand on the alert.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Great distances]\r\n\r\nThere were at Headquarters in March 1900 three brigades of Cavalry, and\r\nthree divisions of Infantry, with their complement of Horse and Field\r\nArtillery, which with other units made up a fighting force of 34,000\r\nmen.  As has been said, Dewetsdorp and Wepener were both nearer to\r\nBloemfontein than to Springfontein, the headquarters of the Third\r\nDivision.  From this place Gatacre had to arrange for the supplies for\r\nposts which were eighty and ninety miles away, and that this could not\r\nbe done without difficulty we see in his letter to me, dated March 31,\r\n1900:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"After reaching this we have been occupied in covering the whole\r\ncountry from Wepener to Philipolis, and all the country between them\r\nand the Orange River, with patrols and small parties, and it is such a\r\nbusiness getting supplies to all these scattered detachments.  We find\r\nwe can make them somewhat self-supporting by making the farmers supply\r\nsheep, and they can get the farmers' wives to bake bread on payment.\r\nThe roads generally speaking are good, not metalled, of course, but\r\nhard clay, which in dry weather are perfect to move upon; in wet\r\nweather they become slippery.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of India and Burma]  (Transcriber's note: map\r\nomitted from this etext because too large to scan)]\r\n\r\nThe same day the following telegram reached Gatacre from Bloemfontein:\r\n\r\n\r\n{250}\r\n\r\n\"(With) Reference (to) telegram from Brabant to your Assistant\r\nAdjutant-General Springfontein repeated to Intelligence here, what\r\nreinforcement do you propose to send him?  Boers are active on that\r\nside and have strong force between Ladybrand and Thabanchu.  Brabant\r\nshould be reinforced and supported.\"[13]\r\n\r\n\r\n[13] From _True Copy_, furnished by D.A.A.G., 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn response to this Gatacre ordered up troops from the Colonial Corps\r\nat Aliwal North, and pushed forward the support at Bushman's Kop.\r\n\r\nOn that same Saturday, March 31, he was directed to arrange for a\r\nbattalion of infantry and a battery to be at Leeuwberg Kopje, eight\r\nmiles from Bloemfontein, at daybreak of April 1.  Three companies of\r\nthe Northumberland Fusiliers and five companies of the Royal Scots were\r\naccordingly sent.  When replying to this order he adds that he has no\r\ninfantry left, and only one battalion from which to find guards for the\r\nrailway line.\r\n\r\nA third message from Headquarters reached Gatacre at 10.47 that night\r\n(the 31st), which informed him of the engagement near the Waterworks,\r\ntold him to exercise special caution on the railway, and to draw in all\r\noutlying forces, adding that \"it would appear that Dewetsdorp is too\r\nfar advanced for security.\"[14]\r\n\r\n\r\n[14] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn response, Gatacre immediately sent off various telegrams by which he\r\nhoped to get in touch with his detachments, and also started off a\r\ndespatch-rider; but the distance was eighty miles, as has been said.\r\n\r\n{251}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: At Dewetsdorp]\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the troops from Smithfield and Helvetia that\r\nwere assembling at Dewetsdorp were due to reach their destination on\r\nSunday, April 1.  On his arrival the Officer Commanding the three\r\ncompanies Royal Irish Fusiliers--\r\n\r\n\"was greeted with information from local sources that a Boer commando\r\nwas expected soon to appear before the village, and, selecting ground\r\nwhich commanded the place, he began to strengthen his position, which\r\nhe covered by outposts.  In the evening a patrol to the north of\r\nDewetsdorp was fired upon.  He informed the Headquarters Third Division\r\nof this by telegram, and also of the rumoured approach of the commando,\r\nwhich, however, was not credited by the Intelligence Officer who\r\naccompanied his detachment.\"[15]\r\n\r\n\r\n[15] See _Official History_, vol. ii. p. 306.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt midnight Gatacre's telegram arrived directing him \"that he should\r\nimmediately move his troops to Reddersburg,\" and closing with the words\r\n\"matter urgent.\"  At 3.30 a.m. next morning (April 2) the\r\ndespatch-rider appeared with the same instructions.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the engagement known as Sannah's Post had taken place\r\non Saturday, March 31, only thirty miles away.  As this unfortunate\r\naffair directly affected the Proclamation detachments, I hope it will\r\nnot seem out of place if I give a brief sketch of what had been taking\r\nplace a little farther north.\r\n\r\nThe main water-supply for the city of Bloemfontein was drawn from a\r\npoint on the Modder {252} River, where it is crossed by the high road\r\nrunning due east to Thaba'Nchu.  This point, which is about twenty-one\r\nmiles from the capital, is known as Sannah's Post.  On March 15 the\r\n\"somewhat inadequate force of 300 mounted infantry\" was sent out to\r\nhold the Waterworks, and two days later a mounted column, 1,500 strong,\r\nunder General French, was pushed on to Thaba'Nchu, twenty-one miles\r\nfarther east.  From this force Colonel Pilcher was detached, and\r\nthrough his operations definite news of the enemy's whereabouts was\r\nobtained and duly forwarded to Bloemfontein.  General French was soon\r\nafter called back to Headquarters, and left Colonel Broadwood in\r\ncommand of the column.  It is clear that--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Broadwood, with his 1,500 men, had never been intended to fight\r\nbattles where he was, forty miles from any supporting force, but only\r\nto publish Lord Roberts's proclamations, and to collect arms from any\r\nBoers that might surrender.\"[16]\r\n\r\n\r\n[16] See _Times History_, vol. iv. p. 33.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo that when he discovered that General Olivier was behind him with\r\n5,000 men, he had no choice but to retire on the Waterworks.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Joubert the control of the Boer forces fell into the\r\nhands of younger men, the most conspicuous amongst whom was Christian\r\nde Wet.  Having conceived a plan for capturing the Waterworks guard, he\r\nplaced {253} his forces astride of the road, and hid them in the bed of\r\na stream about five miles west of the Modder River.  When the day\r\narrived for the execution of his plan, he found that the mounted column\r\nwas also delivered into his hand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sannah's Post]\r\n\r\nA messenger got through who carried news of Broadwood's plight between\r\nOlivier and De Wet to Lord Roberts, and he sent out an infantry\r\ndivision under General Colvile.  But the two forces failed to work\r\ntogether, and the enemy triumphed.  This was on Saturday, March 31.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The material result of De Wet's achievements at Sannah's Post was the\r\nacquisition of seven guns, much ammunition, many horses and waggons,\r\nand a large number of prisoners.  By occupying the Waterworks, which\r\ndid not again pass into Lord Roberts's hands until April 23, he\r\ninflicted great injury on the health of the troops in Bloemfontein.\r\nThe moral effect of his success was enormous.  It confirmed the\r\nresolution of those of the Free State burghers who still remained in\r\narms; it encouraged the waverers; it afforded De Wet the occasion for\r\nputting strong pressure upon the considerable numbers of his fellow\r\ncountrymen who, declaring themselves tired of the war, had given in\r\ntheir rifles to the British troops, and had been allowed to return to\r\ntheir farms as peaceful non-combatants; and it gave those who followed\r\nhim good heart for his next stroke.\"[17]\r\n\r\n\r\n[17] See _Official History_, vol. ii. pp. 298, 299.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday following Gatacre was summoned to Headquarters, and had\r\ninterviews {254} with the Commander-in-Chief, of which he has left the\r\nfollowing memorandum:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"On Sunday, April 1, I proceeded to Bloemfontein by order to see Lord\r\nRoberts, arriving late at night.  Early next morning (April 2) I saw\r\nthe Field-Marshal, and he told me he was placing me in command of the\r\nOrange Free State territory held by us, and was giving me ten other\r\nbattalions, which were to be used as under, _i.e._ six Militia\r\nbattalions to be distributed along the railway south of Bloemfontein,\r\nand in the country east and west of it; the four battalions were, with\r\nthe four I had already (the 2nd wing of the Berkshire was to be called\r\nup from Cape Colony), to make up a Division with which I was to proceed\r\nat once to Dewetsdorp and operate along the Basuto border through\r\nLadybrand, Clocolan, Ficksburg country, to clear Lord Roberts's right\r\nflank, to enable him to advance northwards.  He directed me to draw up\r\nfor his approval a scheme of distribution for the six Militia\r\nbattalions through the country.  This I did, and submitted it on the\r\nspot.  The Field-Marshal was anxious to know by what date I considered\r\nI could concentrate my troops at Reddersburg, ready to move, after\r\nrelief by the Militia battalions.  I replied that, on the assumption\r\nthat I received the Militia battalions on the 6th, I could move on\r\nApril 17 (reliefs had to be effected, transport collected, supplies,\r\netc., etc.).  This date was considered satisfactory by Lord Roberts.\r\nThe same evening (April 2) about 9.30 p.m. Lord Roberts again explained\r\nto me carefully what he wished, that he was anxious for me to move as\r\nsoon as possible, and that I was to proceed to Springfontein\r\nimmediately, and commence {255} preparations.  This I did, morning of\r\nApril 3, by first train.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would appear that nothing was said during the Monday spent at\r\nBloemfontein about the detachment that was moving that very day from\r\nDewetsdorp through Reddersburg back to the railway at Bethanie.  No\r\nanxiety seems to have been felt at Headquarters as to what De Wet would\r\ndo next.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A relief column]\r\n\r\nAt about 7 o'clock on Tuesday evening, April 3, information was brought\r\ninto Edenburg that the Dewetsdorp detachment was surrounded at\r\nMostert's Hoek, a ridge three or four miles east of Reddersburg.  This\r\ndisquieting news was telegraphed to Lord Roberts, who sent an urgent\r\nmessage to Gatacre directing him to prepare to move on Reddersburg, and\r\nasking what troops he had available.  The reply stated that there were\r\nforty scouts and about twenty-five mounted infantry at Springfontein, a\r\nBrigade Division Field Artillery at Bethanie, and about two companies\r\nmounted infantry at or near Edenburg.  A return message informed\r\nGatacre that the Field-Marshal was sending five companies of the\r\nCameron Highlanders by train to Bethanie, and told the General that he\r\nwas on no account to go without them.\r\n\r\nThe order to turn out reached the regiment just before midnight; they\r\nhad three miles to march to the station, and were entrained at 3.30 a.m.\r\n\r\n{256}\r\n\r\nThat same morning, April 4, at about 6 o'clock, the scouts and some\r\nmounted infantry started from Bethanie to reconnoitre towards\r\nReddersburg, which was about twelve miles distant, and an hour later\r\nthey sent in a message that they could hear the firing.\r\n\r\nWhen the five companies of the Camerons and the mounted infantry from\r\nEdenburg had joined him at Bethanie, Gatacre started at the head of the\r\ncolumn.  At 9.30 a.m. another message was sent back by the Officer\r\nCommanding the scouts to say that firing had ceased for half an hour.\r\nGatacre pushed on till he reached a ridge west of the village, but he\r\nwas still five or six miles from the scene of the fight when he learnt\r\nthrough a loyal colonial that two hours earlier the British had\r\nsurrendered to a force of Boers between two and three thousand strong.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Too late]\r\n\r\nIt was then 11 o'clock, and the relief column was at least five miles\r\nfrom the scene of the misfortune.\r\n\r\nThe General called a halt, and eventually decided that his troops,\r\nbeing mainly infantry, could do nothing in the way of pursuit of a\r\nmounted enemy.  After resting for an hour or so, Gatacre came to the\r\nconclusion that the safer course would be to retire on the railway, for\r\nit must be remembered that he had received the most precise orders \"not\r\nto move against the Boers until he had satisfied himself that their\r\nstrength and position warranted his doing so with success.\"[18]\r\n\r\n\r\n[18] See _Official History_, vol. ii. p. 311.\r\n\r\n\r\n{257}\r\n\r\nAbout four miles had been accomplished on the return journey, when a\r\nmessenger arrived from the Chief Staff Officer ordering the column to\r\nreturn and occupy Reddersburg.  Accordingly the men retraced their\r\nsteps and settled down for the night as best they could; but at\r\nmidnight a telegram reached the General containing very urgent\r\ncounter-orders:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The C.-in-C. directs that you retire to Bethanie during this night so\r\nas to reach Bethanie to-morrow morning, as our information leads us to\r\nbelieve that the enemy are moving down in the Reddersburg direction and\r\nyou are not strong enough to oppose a large force.\"[19]\r\n\r\n\r\n[19] From original text.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe column started off again at 2 a.m. April 5.[20]\r\n\r\n\r\n[20] The movements of the Relief Column are taken from _The 79th News_,\r\nspecial issue entitled \"South African War Record,\" p. 17.  The hours\r\ndiffer slightly from those given in the _Official History_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are not concerned here with the fatigues of the march from\r\nDewetsdorp, nor with the particular stress which led to capitulation.\r\nIt is enough to know that although a messenger had succeeded in getting\r\nthrough the enemy's lines, and although the casualties numbered only\r\nten killed and thirty-five wounded out of 591 men of the regular army,\r\nsome one betrayed his comrades' honour, and the whole party was\r\ncaptured.[21]  If this column had been able to hold on an hour or so\r\nlonger, there would have been no Reddersburg incident.  In the same\r\nway, {258} if more prompt and more energetic measures had been taken\r\nfrom Headquarters to rescue the column from the perilous situation\r\ncreated by the defeat at Sannah's Post, the little force could easily\r\nhave been brought into Bloemfontein with the help of cavalry.  As a\r\nmatter of fact there were on April 2 three cavalry brigades camped at\r\nSpringfield, Rustfontein, and Bloemspruit respectively, all of which\r\nlie just outside the capital to the south and east.\r\n\r\n\r\n[21] NOTE.--The Officer Commanding was exonerated from all blame in\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, what had become of the other detachments?  At Wepener,\r\nfour days later, a force of 1,898 men, composed almost entirely of\r\nColonial Corps, under the command of Colonel Dalgety of the Cape\r\nMounted Rifles, was attacked by De Wet and blockaded for fourteen days;\r\nbut so skilfully, under the guidance of Major Ronald Maxwell, R.E., did\r\nthe men entrench themselves, that the total casualties at the end of\r\nthe siege were only 169.\r\n\r\nThe other columns, at Smithfield, Helvetia, and Rouxville, were only\r\nsaved by the skilful handling of Major Allen of the Royal Irish Rifles,\r\nwho collected them all and withdrew on Aliwal North, and by the heroic\r\nspirit of the men themselves.  The detachment from Helvetia marched\r\nseventy-three miles in fifty-two hours, and that from Smithfield\r\nforty-five miles in thirty-six hours.  General Brabant sent out some\r\nempty waggons to meet the exhausted infantry, but, though almost\r\nbarefoot and reeling with fatigue, they refused to accept the lift,\r\nsaying that if they did so the good name of the regiment would suffer.\r\n\r\n{259}\r\n\r\nThe story of all these detachments must be looked at as a whole, as a\r\npolicy.  It was the defeat at Sannah's Post which, coming \"like a bolt\r\nfrom the blue,\" changed the whole situation; \"the dispositions of the\r\ntroops, designed to restore peace, were (now) not merely inadequate,\r\nthey were wholly inappropriate.\"[22]  It is difficult to see how the\r\nposition of the Dewetsdorp detachment differs from that of the others,\r\nall of which were but the execution of the policy sketched in the\r\ntelegram from the Field-Marshal to the War Office of March 21, given on\r\npage 243.\r\n\r\n\r\n[22] See _Official History_, vol. ii. p. 305.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn April 9 Sir Herbert Chermside arrived at Springfontein to take over\r\nthe command of the Third Division, and the next day the following\r\nletter reached Sir William Gatacre:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_From Chief of the Staff, S.A.F.F._\r\n\r\n\"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"I am directed by the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief in South Africa\r\nto inform you that his lordship has decided, though with much regret,\r\nto relieve you of your present command.  You will therefore be good\r\nenough to make over the command of the 3rd Division to Major-General\r\nSir Herbert Chermside, G.C.M.G., C.B., and proceed to England at an\r\nearly date.\r\n\r\n\"I have the honour to be, Sir, \"Your obedient servant, \"B. DUFF,\r\n_Colonel, for Major-General,_ \"_Chief of the Staff, S.A.F. Force._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the camp woke up on the morning of the 11th their ex-commander was\r\ngone.  The {260} following letter reflects the spirit in which his\r\nstaff officers looked at the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"REDDERSBURG, _April_ 12, 1900.\r\n\r\n\"It is with a heavy heart indeed that I write this.  Why, oh why did\r\nthey treat our General so hardly, so unfairly?  We know nothing except\r\nthe bare facts.  All are sorry and grieved, and many question the\r\nfairness, the justice of the action taken.  No one worked harder than\r\nhe did.  I may say it would have been impossible to do so.  He never\r\nspared himself.  Luck, cursed luck, has been all against him.  I heard\r\ntwo days ago from England that they believed that he had attacked at\r\nStormberg with two battalions when he had eight at his command,--such a\r\ngross mistake!  Now the luck having turned, as it appeared, the\r\nunfortunate Royal Irish Rifles get caught again, although no possible\r\nblame could be attached to him by reasonable men.  I worked out the\r\norders and telegrams he had given and received myself, and I know what\r\nwas done.  They seem to have attributed the blame of it to him--most\r\nunfairly.  He was so good about it and so plucky, blaming no one and\r\ntaking the blow so courageously,--man could not be braver under any\r\ncircumstances.  All the interest of the campaign has gone for me, and\r\n---- feels for him as much as I do.\r\n\r\n\"We shall never have a chief whom we can serve more loyally, who was\r\nalways considerate and even-tempered, and spared himself so little.\r\nHis faults, if I may use the expression, are his virtues, devotion and\r\nloyalty and energy--to use all in the service of his country.  It has\r\nbeen a great blow to us all.\r\n\r\n\"Believe me, we feel it as the loss of a personal and dear friend.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{261}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n1900-1903\r\n\r\nBACK TO COLCHESTER\r\n\r\nSince the Book of Job was written steadfastness in adversity has ever\r\nbeen considered as a virtue of high order.  Indeed, what need is there\r\nin a Christian country to insist that want of success in the affairs of\r\nthis world is not incompatible with an unsullied conscience and a\r\nstainless shield?\r\n\r\nFrom Capetown Gatacre sent a telegram begging Lord Roberts to give some\r\nreason for his action, and in reply received a letter which (while\r\ndeclining to discuss the main issue) closes with the following sentence:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This action, which Lord Roberts has felt it his duty to take, casts no\r\nslur whatever upon your honour, your personal courage, your energy and\r\nzeal, which are beyond all question.\"[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] For the reasons given by Lord Roberts to the War Office, see the\r\ndispatch printed at the end of this volume, p. 286; reprinted from the\r\n_Official History_, vol. ii. p. 614.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the spirit that welcomed Sir William on his arrival in\r\nEngland; for he came straight home and calmly awaited the verdict of\r\nthe War Office in London.\r\n\r\nThe first to pour balm on her servant's {262} wounded spirit was Her\r\nGracious Majesty Queen Victoria.  Gatacre reached London on May 12, and\r\non the 24th, in the _Birthday Gazette_, his name appeared as a\r\nrecipient of the Gold Medal of a new Order, the Kaiser-i-Hind, which\r\nthe Queen had just created for the recognition of Public Service in\r\nIndia.  This first distribution of the decoration had regard more\r\nespecially to services rendered in dealing with the plague and the\r\nfamine of 1897 and the following years.\r\n\r\nOnly five days after Gatacre's arrival the relief of Mafeking, after\r\n217 days' siege, was celebrated in London with much popular rejoicing.\r\nThis uproarious joy jarred mercilessly on Sir William's mood, but the\r\nwhole country exulted, and there was no way of escape.  The daily\r\npapers too were full of South African news, so that even this source of\r\nidle distraction carried its sting.  And so it happened that when an\r\nold friend came to call on the morning of May 24, and to inquire after\r\nthe General's health (which to most men seemed to provide an obvious\r\nexplanation of his return), he had the pleasure of informing us of the\r\nnew decoration.\r\n\r\nOn the following day Gatacre received instructions to resume command of\r\nthe Eastern District.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A welcome home]\r\n\r\nBritish hearts, ever loyal to brave men in distress, did not stop to\r\nquibble over professional responsibilities; they remembered the years\r\nof devoted service, they knew of his personal gallantry, and they\r\ntrusted time to prove their faith.  Colchester struck the first {263}\r\nnote: the townspeople turned out in their thousands to cheer one whom\r\nthey knew and loved.  During the drive from the station to the camp the\r\ncrowd massed in the streets was so great and so vociferous that the\r\nwave of feeling was overwhelming, and it was with a sense of relief\r\nthat we reached our destination.\r\n\r\nIn the following June the Prince and Princess of Wales (as we then\r\nspoke of Their present Majesties) honoured Norwich with a visit to open\r\nthe new buildings of the Jenny Lind Hospital.  The whole population of\r\nthe royal borough was in the streets that lovely summer day, and made\r\ntheir loyalty known in the usual way; but they did not forget to keep a\r\nsharp lookout for the man who had come from the war, for the man who\r\nhad so lately fought in their battles; and as the cheers died away\r\nafter the royal carriage had passed out of sight, they were renewed\r\nwith deafening insistence as each voice strained to make its message of\r\nlove and esteem reach the ears of one who with his own eyes had seen\r\nthe enemy.  For I believe that in those days of popular excitement over\r\nthe occupation of Pretoria, Gatacre was, to the man in the street, the\r\npersonification of a successful war that had just reached its\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nThis burst of feeling, howsoever prompted, was very touching, but what\r\ndid more to encourage Sir William than any other single event was the\r\ngracious and cordial greeting accorded to him by His Royal Highness\r\nwhen, as in duty bound, the General had the honour of receiving {264}\r\nhim at Norwich Station.  Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales also\r\nsent for me in the course of the afternoon and was pleased to use very\r\nkindly and appreciative words about my husband's services to his\r\ncountry, and her sympathy with his immediate trouble.\r\n\r\nWhen in the round of annual inspections the General visited the Cadet\r\nCorps of Bedford Grammar School, he had further evidence of his\r\npersonal popularity in the attentions showered upon him by all the boys\r\nin the school, who insisted on dispensing with the usual mode of\r\ntraction and harnessing themselves to his carriage.  It was the same\r\nthing at Clacton, when the Lord Mayor of London opened the Essex\r\nAgricultural Show.  Sir William had been detained in his office, and\r\nonly reached the show-ground just before the luncheon assembly broke\r\nup; the speaker within the tent was at a loss to account for an\r\nuntimely uproar.  It was the crowd outside who had recognised \"General\r\nGatacre,\" and, as he entered, those inside the tent took up the strain.\r\n\r\nHowever gratifying such popular outbursts may be in their spontaneity,\r\nit is the reasoned judgment of his peers that a man ultimately values.\r\nThe following telegram was received by the senior officer in the\r\nstation on the day after our return to Colchester.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The members of the Aldershot Conservative Club are delighted to read\r\nof the deservedly enthusiastic welcome accorded to General Gatacre\r\nyesterday, and wish to convey through you {265} to the General their\r\nhearty greetings upon his safe return from the seat of war.  We do not\r\nforget his services to the Empire, and we loyally reciprocate\r\nColchester's sentiment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sympathy]\r\n\r\nIt was in the summer of 1900 that the call arose for more troops for\r\nSouth Africa, which brought several new county Yeomanry Corps and the\r\nVolunteer Service Companies into existence; it was Sir William's\r\nbusiness to promote the formation of all such corps within the nine\r\ncounties that made up the Eastern District, and to contribute in every\r\nway to their efficiency.  This brought him into personal contact with\r\nthe leading men of all parts of his command, for it will be remembered\r\nhow much public spirit was shown in the revival of interest in the\r\nAuxiliary Forces that marked the years 1900 and 1901.  I should like\r\nhere to record how helpful were the loyalty, the confidence, and I may\r\nsay the sympathy (if that word can stand for an unexpressed sentiment\r\nwhere silence alone befitted the dignity of the personnel on both\r\nsides) that he received on all sides; and how the cordial relations\r\nestablished between the General and the county society of his district\r\nencouraged him to tread patiently and hopefully the path he had traced\r\nfor himself.  In many cases the official visit to some great man's\r\nhouse to inspect the corps encamped in his park led to shooting visits\r\nin the following autumn--a delightful testimony to the undiminished\r\npower of his personal charm.\r\n\r\n{266}\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, those in daily converse with Sir William, both in\r\nhis office and outside, were not blind to the sustained effort on his\r\npart that was necessary to carry him through those trying days of\r\neclipse.  One under whom he had served in India wrote, with the insight\r\nof true affection, for the guidance and inspiration of another:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I feel that it is very difficult for Gatacre to face all that he has\r\nto bear; but I feel certain that through it all he has exhibited\r\nsoldierly qualities of a high order, that must be appreciated; but his\r\nreturn home will be very difficult for him to accept, and I fear he\r\nwill have no opportunity of justifying himself.  You must, you know, be\r\nin very good heart, and feel very brave for his coming.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was very difficult for Gatacre to bear, and he never forgot\r\n\r\n  The hopes by weakness foiled, or evil fate,\r\n  The slander, the dumb heart-break, and the pain.\r\n\r\nIt was incontrovertibly the fiercest trial to which he could have been\r\nsubjected.\r\n\r\nThose who have only known suffering when it comes shrouded in the\r\nsimple majesty of death can have no measure of the additional\r\nbitterness of blows dealt by the hand of man, nor the torture endured\r\nby a righteous man when his honour is affected.\r\n\r\nGatacre had known what it was to suffer in his private life, but then\r\nhis profession had come {267} to his assistance, and by flinging\r\nhimself with all his natural vigour into its arms for shelter and\r\ncomfort he had triumphed over his pain.  In this case he had been given\r\na second chance, he had been allowed to be happy again.  The laurels\r\nthat he had reaped doubled their value in his eyes in that there was\r\nanother to share them.  But his profession at all times had a far\r\nlarger share of his heart than anything that contributed to his\r\npleasure.  That was the way he was made; his profession was identified\r\nwith his duty, and for him there was nothing so enjoyable as those\r\nduties which taxed his endurance and his energy.  His soldiering was\r\nall in all to him; it was his record; all he had to show; the building\r\nthat he had built with the bricks that had been served out to him.  In\r\nhis own estimation he was nothing if not a soldier.\r\n\r\nNow, recalled, rejected, the worldly hope on which he had set his heart\r\nhad turned to ashes in his hand: the ambition which had been his saving\r\ngrace in the days of tribulation was lost to him now.  Was this the\r\nguerdon for all the years of loving toil?  Was this \"the reward of it\r\nall\"?\r\n\r\nWho shall say whence a man draws his reserves of strength?  It seemed\r\nto some of us that in his own dauntless character Gatacre found\r\nunquenchable inspiration: his independence of the opinion of men, his\r\nown intimate knowledge of the facts of the case, his untarnished record\r\nof loyal service, and his own \"triumphant endurance and conquering\r\nmoral {268} energy\"--these were things of which no one could deprive\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n  I will be patient and proud, and soberly acquiesce.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hopes]\r\n\r\nWith a supreme effort of steadfastness and a resolute courage he forced\r\nhis faith in disinterested work to come to his rescue, but henceforth\r\nhe was working not to deaden the pain of outraged sensibilities, not\r\nfor his own advancement, but for the work's own sake--to forward the\r\ncause of the army in South Africa, for the simple service of the\r\ncountry.  Nothing but his accumulated powers of silent endurance, his\r\nproud indifference to his own feelings, aided by the response that his\r\nspeechless loyalty won from his daily companions, could have sustained\r\nhim through those three and a half long years while he silently and\r\nquietly did his duty.  Borrowing the words of another we may say that\r\n\"his military experience had intensified his natural horror of schism\r\nand lukewarm co-operation, and magnanimity was a stronger force than\r\nany personal consideration.\"\r\n\r\nNow I contend that in achieving this triumph of discipline Gatacre\r\nreached a loftier level in the sight of God and man than any to which\r\nhigh appointments could have raised him; and I believe that his example\r\nand his memory in this respect alone will outlive the story of many\r\nbattlefields, and that he will thus have transformed a story of\r\nmomentary defeat into an everlasting victory.\r\n\r\nThis attitude implied a rare simplicity and a {269} profound knowledge\r\nof the world.  He preferred to accept misconstruction and\r\nmisrepresentation rather than betray the lofty promptings of his own\r\nsoul; and he was at the same time perfectly conscious that any attempt\r\n(even though successful in the main) to set himself right in the eyes\r\nof the world would alienate his friends and make enemies.  These words\r\nare something more than a speculative analysis of what might have been\r\nhis frame of mind; for the latter argument was the ground of his\r\nrefusal to accept any of the several offers he received from writers\r\nwho asked his sanction for the preparation of articles throwing light\r\non the events in which he had taken part.\r\n\r\nAs the General recovered his balance and settled down to the routine of\r\nhis work, his natural buoyancy returned, and he once more took a\r\npleasure in all that went on around him.  Hopes that things might work\r\nout all right in the end arose to cheer him, and there was much to\r\nfoster such an idea.\r\n\r\nWhen the South African War Commission was initiated, he hoped that this\r\nwould give him a chance to explain matters, imagined that it would be a\r\nconfidential court of inquiry, a sort of hearing in camera, where,\r\nwithout insubordination or disloyalty, he would be encouraged to speak.\r\nIn May 1903 he was summoned to give evidence.  On their arrival all the\r\nwitnesses are taken aside by one of the Commissioners and formally\r\ncautioned not to say anything that might be used against them.  To\r\nGatacre these words carried a personal meaning, though the phraseology\r\ncompletely puzzled {270} him.  He failed to see how anything that was\r\ntrue could be so used, and could find no purpose in the warning.  The\r\nCommissioners, however, confined their attention to questions of\r\nefficiency and other generalities, and no interest was shown in his\r\npersonal affairs.  And thus this hope of salvation vanished.  One touch\r\nof character showed itself: he tells the Commissioners how he raised\r\ncompanies of mounted infantry from the battalions in his command, and\r\ngoes on to say that as soon as the men had learnt to ride and to\r\nperform their special duties, he was ordered to send them forward to\r\nArmy Headquarters, so that his own force was constantly denuded of\r\nmounted troops.  In the proof submitted for correction his reply to an\r\nobvious question appeared as \"I never complained.\"  He struck out the\r\npast tense, and it stands as his motto: \"I never complain.\"[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] _South African War Commission_, vol. iii. p. 277.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Departure]\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance in the last year of his command revived his hopes\r\nof re-employment.  This was a visit by the Commander-in-Chief to\r\nColchester and other places in the Eastern District.  Everything had\r\ngone very well, the Commander-in-Chief had expressed himself highly\r\nsatisfied with all that he had seen, and on the last day, at a garden\r\nparty at Chelmsford, the Chief Staff Officer handed on the encouraging\r\nmessage that Lord Roberts had been much pleased with his visit, and\r\nthat he had remarked a higher tone amongst officers and men at\r\nColchester than at any other camp.  This was, of {271} course, said in\r\nprivate conversation, but it was taken as \"inspired.\"\r\n\r\nIn August of the same year, 1903, when preparations were being made for\r\nextensive manoeuvres to be held on Salisbury Plain, Gatacre was\r\nappointed as Umpire-in-Chief of the Blue Army.  This was a good omen,\r\nfor it seemed incredible that a post of such importance in the training\r\nof the troops engaged should be given to an officer who was likely soon\r\nto be struck off the active list, who was, so to speak, already cast.\r\n\r\nThat he had a genuine belief that his services might yet be utilised by\r\nthe State in some capacity is shown by his decision to go on half pay.\r\nIn the summer of 1903 he called on the Secretary of State for the\r\nColonies and asked him to consider his name for any suitable post in\r\nthat Department.  I believe that he would have taken the Governorship\r\nof any island, regardless of its size or climate, just for the love of\r\nthe service of the State--just for the pleasure of using powers that he\r\nknew himself still to possess unimpaired.\r\n\r\nThe term of the command ran out on December 8, 1903.  That he should\r\nvacate the post without immediate prospect of re-employment was in\r\nitself a bitterness to him, and chilled the expectations that had\r\ncontributed to the harmony of his days.\r\n\r\nHis memory hung about Colchester for many years.  It was not merely\r\nthat his portrait hung in the Soldiers' Institute that he had opened,\r\n{272} nor that he had won many extra comforts for both officers and men\r\nin the new barracks that were built under his direction.  It was more\r\nthan this; it was the weight of his name, the tradition of love and\r\nesteem that the name revived.  When the men were decorating their rooms\r\nfor Christmas 1906 they made a banner which carried these words: \"To\r\nthe memory of Major-General Sir William Forbes Gatacre--one of the\r\nbest.\"  This spontaneous tribute was set up nearly a year after his\r\ndeath, and four years after he had left Colchester, a time long enough\r\nfor the reliefs to have removed all the battalions that had known him\r\nthere; but there was scarcely a regiment in the service that had not\r\nknown him somewhere in his thirteen years' service as General Officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{273}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n1904-1906\r\n\r\nABYSSINIA\r\n\r\nAlthough Gatacre undoubtedly indulged hopes of further employment, he\r\nhad not much confidence in such expectations.  While prepared to move\r\nonwards should his desires be fulfilled, he was simultaneously\r\nsafeguarding his retreat.\r\n\r\nDuring the manoeuvres he had made inquiries about the working of the\r\nRemount Department in the counties, and had discovered that there was a\r\npost open to him which would provide both congenial occupation and\r\nreasonable remuneration, namely £500 a year in addition to pension.\r\n\r\nHe bought a little house in the Cotswold Hills, and for the first few\r\nweeks enjoyed the leisure, as he had always enjoyed the leisure of his\r\nsixty days' leave.\r\n\r\nAlthough the post he coveted was vacant, and although similar posts\r\nwere being worked by retired officers of his rank, unaccountable\r\ndifficulties arose in securing it.  In the hope of wearing down these\r\nobstacles, whatever might be their origin, Gatacre got permission to\r\nhold the post for eight months, but the pay attached was withheld, the\r\narrangement being that he was to draw allowances only, {274} on the\r\nscale fixed by Government for all such duty, which is calculated to\r\ncover actual travelling expenses.  The work consisted mainly of\r\noverhauling and replenishing the list of registered horses, over an\r\narea of twenty-two counties.  These included Wales and Cornwall to the\r\nwest, while on the east a line drawn from Cheshire to Hampshire\r\ninclusive of these two counties would form a rough boundary.  He very\r\nsoon got profoundly interested in his task.\r\n\r\nHe invented a new system of tabulating all sorts of information useful\r\nto the Department.  He found that to complete what was properly a\r\nyear's work in eight months involved working under more pressure than\r\ncould justly be expected, more especially as his services were\r\nvoluntary; but the old incentive of reaching his own self-imposed\r\nstandard would not let him leave his work unfinished.  The facts he had\r\ncollected were useless, his labour would be in vain, unless he could\r\nrecord them in a form that would be handy for reference.  His reports\r\nwere to be the _vade mecum_ of the Remount and Yeomanry Officer in each\r\ncounty; there was one little volume for each county, and a General\r\nDirectory for use at Headquarters.  Permission was obtained from Sir\r\nEvelyn Wood, commanding the Second Army Corps, to employ an army clerk\r\nand two typewriting clerks (women) in an office in Salisbury, and there\r\nGatacre worked for six weeks in July and August 1904.  In order to\r\ncomplete his task in the allotted time, he had to stick so closely to\r\nhis desk that he {275} grudged the loss of working hours which would be\r\nthe consequence of a Sunday at home.  But it occurred to him that as\r\nthe nights were short and cool he could save the time that would be\r\nwasted in the train by doing the journey by night on his bicycle.  The\r\ndistance was sixty-four miles; the first time it worked very well and\r\nhe met with no mishap, but on the return journey he punctured at 2\r\na.m., and as it was too dark to do his own repairs, he had to complete\r\nthe last twenty-four miles on foot.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On the road]\r\n\r\nA fortnight later he was on the road again, but decided to come by day.\r\nHe telegraphed to me that he was leaving Salisbury at noon on Saturday.\r\nHaving remonstrated with him about making this journey in one stretch,\r\nas he had done previously, I wired that I would meet him at Malmesbury\r\nat 5 p.m., reckoning that he could not complete his forty-eight miles\r\nin less than five hours, and that my presence would ensure a break in\r\nthe long spin.  He arrived five minutes before time, but we did not\r\nstart off again till six.  On another occasion he started at daybreak,\r\nand we met at nine o'clock for breakfast at Malmesbury.  His age was\r\nthen sixty; the story is told in order to show not only that he still\r\npossessed staying powers above the average, but that he still found the\r\nhighest delight in using such powers.\r\n\r\nIn September he was informed that the Remount Department had no longer\r\nany use for his services.  Across the letter to this effect I find\r\nwritten in his own hand \"Disappointing, {276} very!\"  Once more it\r\nseemed to him that his devotion and exertion counted for naught; he had\r\ndone good work, but he had mysteriously failed to make it of any\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1905]\r\n\r\nThere was, however, an interpretation of the situation which, though\r\nhidden from his eyes, can be read between the lines of the file of\r\ncorrespondence.  He could see and could gauge the usefulness of his\r\nservices and ideas, but his humble-mindedness hid from him the fact\r\nthat it was his own value that stood in his way.  His highly trained\r\nadministrative faculties immediately grasped all the bearings and\r\npossibilities of the problem before him, and he could not resist the\r\ndesire to improve upon existing methods.  This was not what the\r\nDepartment wanted.  Although willing to admit the intrinsic merits of\r\nhis scheme, the authorities were not prepared to put in force such a\r\ncomprehensive measure of reorganisation; so that while they could\r\nhonestly say that his \"work would serve as a model,\" they had no option\r\nbut to discontinue using a tool that was too powerful, too keen, for\r\ntheir purpose.  His military rank and his administrative ability made\r\nit impossible to employ him in the subordinate position that he coveted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Retired]\r\n\r\nYet another blow was hanging over him.  On March 22,1905, he went to\r\nLondon to attend the Memorial Service to His Royal Highness the Duke of\r\nCambridge in Westminster Abbey.  At such a gathering he naturally found\r\nmany friends (more especially as the Duke had been Colonel-in-Chief of\r\nthe Middlesex Regiment), {277} and, according to one who was amongst\r\nthe number, it was a pleasure to see how many distinguished men came to\r\ngreet him, civilians as well as soldiers, and among them men of\r\npolitical standing who knew him more by reputation than in person.\r\nThis was the last flicker of his public life, for when he returned to\r\nthe country that evening the intimation of his immediate retirement lay\r\namong his correspondence.  By contrast to his mood when a few hours\r\nearlier he had stood honoured among his peers, this letter seemed a\r\nstinging blow, and I can confidently say that he did not expect it.\r\nThere were still eight months to run before he reached the age of\r\nsixty-two, at which point he would (in the event of his not having been\r\npromoted to the rank of Lieutenant-General) have had to \"retire\" under\r\nthe regulations.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that we had vaguely dreaded had come to pass.  The thing\r\nwas unthinkable, but it was true--the words in his friend's letter had\r\nbecome prophecy: he was to \"have no opportunity of justifying himself,\"\r\nno chance of obliterating the slur that had been cast on his name.  His\r\ncareer was at an end, and it had closed a dishonoured career, when to\r\nhave held one more appointment, however insignificant, would have\r\nimplied recognition of the facts of the case and compensation for the\r\nhasty judgment.\r\n\r\nIt was some time in the summer of 1905 that the late Sir Lepel Griffin\r\ninvited Gatacre to sit on the board of the Kordofan Trading Company.\r\n{278} We welcomed the new interest.  I thought that the pretext for\r\nregular visits to London was a desirable thing; I liked to think of his\r\nmoving amongst busy men, and having something to occupy his mind.\r\nThere was no idea of making a fortune; we had very little spare\r\ncapital, and he only invested the small amount necessary to qualify as\r\na Director.\r\n\r\nFrom the first he foresaw the opportunity that might arise of visiting\r\nthe territory specified in the concession.  The prospect attracted him\r\nwildly.  As the season approached when such a proposition could be\r\nseriously entertained, his spirits rose, and he revelled in the idea of\r\nstarting off for the desert; he took the keenest pleasure in preparing\r\nevery contrivance for his comfort that his experience of camp-life\r\ncould suggest; he set about getting books and pamphlets in which he\r\ncould learn the history of the trade in rubber and the chemical\r\nprocesses of its manufacture.\r\n\r\nA telegram which reached us on November 10, asking whether he could be\r\nready to start by the Peninsular and Oriental night mail of the 17th,\r\nlifted him into the highest spirits: from that moment he talked of\r\nnothing but tents, rifles, and such-like necessities, and thought of\r\nnothing but the valuable report that he would prepare for his\r\nco-Directors.\r\n\r\nTo those who have been inclined to blame me for letting him go, I would\r\nreply that it still appears to me that any attempt to stop him would\r\nhave been dictated by selfish motives.  He was offered a delightful\r\ntrip, one that would {279} afford him all those arduous pleasures that\r\nhis soul loved.  Why should I stand in his way?  I did desire greatly\r\nto accompany him, but in such a short space it would have been\r\nimpossible to wind up his affairs and so set me free to go.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Up the Nile]\r\n\r\nThe rubber forests that were the objective of the trip lay in\r\nAbyssinia, east and south of Addis Abeba.  The party consisted of the\r\nGeneral, in command; an experienced Syrian trader named Idlibi, who had\r\nacted as his interpreter during the Egyptian Campaign of 1898; one or\r\ntwo men of a similar class, and a suitable number of servants and\r\nporters.  Amongst Sir William's three personal servants, one was a\r\nMahommedan bearer from India, with whom he could talk freely in\r\nHindustani, and who could therefore act as interpreter to the Arab\r\nservants.  The route selected involved a trip in steamers of about 500\r\nmiles up the White Nile to Taufikia, and then, turning eastward, a\r\nfurther 250 miles up the tributary river Sobat, which in its upper\r\nreaches is called the Baro, to Gambela, from which it is 300 miles by a\r\ngood caravan track to Addis Abeba.\r\n\r\nAt Fashoda, which is now officially called Kodok, the party came across\r\nan English missionary boat.  Gatacre went on board and had tea with the\r\nfive missionaries a few days before Christmas.\r\n\r\nIt was hoped that there would have been enough water in the river to\r\nfloat the shallow craft right on to Gambela, but first one boat and\r\nthen the two smaller craft ran aground.  {280} It was therefore\r\nnecessary to open communications from Keg, where the last barge\r\nstranded, to Gambela by road, a distance of about thirty-eight miles.\r\nLeaving Idlibi in charge of the caravan, Sir William accomplished this\r\nmarch on foot in three days, accompanied by his servants and a few\r\nporters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1906]\r\n\r\nGambela is an important trading centre, and was the first objective of\r\nthe journey.  Politically it is known as an Enclave--that is, a tract\r\nof country leased by the King of Abyssinia to the Soudan Government.\r\nIt thus becomes a frontier post of the Soudan, and has a small\r\nSoudanese garrison, which in January 1906 was under the command of the\r\nMemour Mehined Riad Effendi.\r\n\r\nThe Memour was exceedingly hospitable to Sir William, receiving him as\r\na guest in his house, and doing everything in his power to facilitate\r\nhis journey.  Gatacre's letters speak most gratefully of the kindness\r\nhe received at this officer's hands.  At Gambela he discovered the\r\nCompany's agent, and arranged with him to procure three hundred\r\ncoolies, who should march to Keg, and then carry the merchandise from\r\nthe boats along the track by which Sir William himself had just\r\ntravelled.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His death in the desert]\r\n\r\nHaving completed his business, Gatacre started back to join Idlibi, and\r\nreport progress.  On this return journey he was unfortunate in his\r\ncamping-grounds.  Tents being superfluous in such a climate, the party\r\njust bivouacked where they halted when the sudden darkness of {281} the\r\ntropics fell upon them.  In a small notebook of daily jottings, which\r\nat his leisure Gatacre worked up into a more formal journal, I find the\r\nfollowing entry on January 11, 1906: \"Camped in a swamp--horrible\r\nwater.\"  He reached Keg next day, and was pleased to find that Idlibi\r\nhad disembarked all the stuff and divided it into suitable loads for\r\nthe men to carry.  A few days later, being impatient at the non-arrival\r\nof the coolies, Gatacre decided again to make his way to Gambela, but\r\nwas attacked with fever on the road, and died at a place known as\r\nIddeni.\r\n\r\nHis body was conveyed in a canoe to Gambela, where Mehined Riad Effendi\r\nsaw to its burial in the Abyssinian Christian Cemetery, with due\r\nformality.\r\n\r\nOn Idlibi's arrival with the merchandise a court of inquiry was held,\r\nat which the Memour presided.  The depositions of all the servants were\r\nformally taken, and a translation of their words was forwarded through\r\nthe British Consul at Addis Abeba to the Foreign Office in London.  It\r\nappears therein that there was another Englishman moving to and fro\r\nduring that week, and that he passed the General on the Tuesday\r\nprevious to his death, which took place on Thursday, January 18, 1906.\r\nI mention this to show that the locality was not unknown to\r\ncivilisation, and that Gatacre was not the only one to brave the\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that darkness overtook him on the 11th while on swampy\r\nground, so that he was {282} compelled to pass the night exposed to\r\ndangerous miasmas.  I am convinced that had it not been for this\r\nmisfortune, or some similar accidental misadventure, he would have\r\nreturned with the rest of the mission on June 10 as young and\r\nhigh-spirited as he was on his departure.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n  Lofty designs must close in like effects:\r\n      Loftily lying,\r\n  Leave him--still loftier than the world suspects,\r\n      Living and dying.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThe key-note to Gatacre's character may be said to be willingness--an\r\neager and fearless willingness to follow the right, the best, an\r\nunconditional spending of himself in carrying out the lofty conceptions\r\nof duty and service with which he was gifted.  Everything he undertook,\r\neverything he accomplished, was done with an eager gallantry and a\r\njoyful zeal.  The effect of these qualities was enhanced by a proud\r\nindifference to the cost to himself.\r\n\r\nHis soldierly heedlessness in risking his life had its moral\r\ncounterpart in his willingness to accept to the full all responsibility\r\nfor his actions.  How should one who feared not the Hand of God--\"the\r\narrow that flieth by day, nor the pestilence that walketh in\r\ndarkness\"--how should such a one fear the judgment of man?\r\n\r\nIt is to the remarkable association of an exalted sense of duty with\r\nexceptional physical powers that Gatacre owes much of his distinction.\r\nHis {283} standard of efficiency and discipline was as far above the\r\naverage as were his powers of bodily endurance.  His lowliness of mind,\r\nhowever, hid from him the true measure of his endowments, and led him\r\nto try to inspire all men with his own lofty ideals.  During his long\r\nservices as staff officer he was always ready to show to his Chief the\r\nenthusiastic co-operation that he expected from those who were serving\r\nunder him.  Though some officers may have smarted under his sarcasms,\r\nthough they may have thought that he overtaxed his troops, it is\r\nadmitted on all sides that his exactions were prompted solely by the\r\ninterests of the service, and that his life was the expression of the\r\nprecepts that he instilled.  In the final act of his military career\r\nGatacre proved that he was ready to do as he would be done by--to\r\nsubmit himself without question to the word of authority.  Many a time\r\nhad he been face to face with death; when something more precious than\r\nlife itself was demanded he laid aside his reputation without a murmur.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The broken arcs]\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n  Therefore to whom do I turn but to Thee, the ineffable Name?\r\n    Builder and Maker, Thou, of houses not made with hands!\r\n  What, have fear of change from Thee who art ever the same?\r\n    Doubt that Thy power can fill the heart that Thy power expands?\r\n  There shall never be one lost good!  What was, shall live as before;\r\n    The evil is null, is nought, is silence implying sound;\r\n  What was good, shall be good, with, for evil, so much good more;\r\n    On the earth the broken arcs; in the heaven a perfect round.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n{284}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Finis]\r\n\r\nIn a sense Gatacre was but the fulfilment of an everlasting type.  It\r\nis this quality in him, this spark of the eternal Quixotic, of the\r\neternal Heroic, of the eternal Tragic, that redeems his life from the\r\ncommonplace, that has made him an example to some of his own\r\ngeneration, and may yet make him an example to some that are to come.\r\nDeath has put an end to controversy.  His fair fame remains; he is\r\ncrowned with the halo of the departed, and his name is written on the\r\nlong roll of true knights, _sans peur et sans reproche_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{285}\r\n\r\nIn Memoriam\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, May 26, 1906, an alabaster tablet bearing the inscription\r\ngiven below was dedicated by the Rev.

I was, however, most anxious to avoid,\r\nif it were possible, the infliction on him of the slur which\r\nnecessarily attaches itself to a General who is removed from his\r\ncommand while on active service.  I, therefore, refused to supersede\r\nhim at the time when I assumed the chief command in South Africa,\r\nbelieving that I might safely employ him on the lines of communication\r\nor in any position not actually in the front.\r\n\r\n{287}\r\n\r\n\"On March 28 I telegraphed to Lieut.-General Gatacre as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'No. C. 696.  If you have enough troops at your disposal I should like\r\nyou to occupy Dewetsdorp.  It would make the road to Maseru safe, and\r\nprevent the enemy from using the telegraph line to the south.  _Let me\r\nknow what you can do to this end._'\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To the question italicised above, Lieut.-General Gatacre gave me no\r\nreply.  In answer to my telegram he sent a list of movements then in\r\nprogress in the southern part of the Orange Free State, east of the\r\nrailway, which included a movement of two companies Royal Irish Rifles\r\ntowards Dewetsdorp, where they were due to arrive on Sunday (April 1).\r\n\r\n\"On March 30 he wired that two companies mounted infantry and three\r\ncompanies Royal Irish Rifles were moving on Dewetsdorp.\r\n\r\n\"On March 31 I wired to Lieut.-General Gatacre that I considered\r\nDewetsdorp too far advanced for security, and on April 1 he informed me\r\nthat he had sent a despatch rider to Dewetsdorp with orders for the\r\ntroops there to fall back on Reddersburg.\r\n\r\n\"The result of these movements was that in falling back these companies\r\nwere surrounded east of Reddersburg and, being without food or water,\r\nwere eventually compelled to surrender.  For this result I must hold\r\nLieut.-General Gatacre responsible.  Dewetsdorp is some forty-five\r\nmiles by road east of the railway on which the mass of the troops were\r\nstationed, and is {288} therefore a position in which a small force is\r\nmuch isolated and might be in great danger if attacked.  It appears,\r\nhowever, that Lieut.-General Gatacre ordered two companies mounted\r\ninfantry and three companies Royal Irish Rifles to Dewetsdorp on his\r\nown responsibility, and failed to give me the information I asked for\r\nas to what he could do with the troops at his disposal as regards\r\nholding the place, which, if supplied, would have enabled me to judge\r\nof its adequacy or otherwise, and therefore whether Dewetsdorp should\r\nor should not be occupied.  The small force he actually sent was\r\nentirely incapable of holding its own so far from sufficient force, and\r\nbeing partly composed of infantry was unable to move rapidly when a\r\nretirement became necessary.  I consider that in thus isolating a small\r\ndetachment, Lieut.-General Gatacre has shown a grave want of judgment\r\nwhich must necessarily shake the confidence of those under his orders\r\nand have a bad effect on the _moral_ of his troops.  I am therefore\r\nunable to retain him in command of his division and have given orders\r\nfor his relief and return to England.\r\n\r\n\"ROBERTS, Field-Marshal\"\r\n\r\n\"BLOEMFONTEIN, \"_April_ 16, 1900.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{289}\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAddis Abeba, Abyssinia: W.

Crown 8vo.\r\nCloth, 2s. 6d. net; paper, 1s. net.\r\n\r\nThe Spectator says:--\"It is with no small satisfaction that we note the\r\nrepublication, under the title of 'A Nation in Arms,' of the speeches\r\non the question of National Service delivered by Lord Roberts....  It\r\nis not the creation of a military caste for which he pleads, but the\r\nbuilding up of the highest type of citizen--the citizen who is able to\r\nprotect his native land and his rights and liberties himself and\r\nwithout external aid, and who believes that national safety is not to\r\nbe hired, but to be achieved by self-sacrifice....  It is hardly\r\nnecessary to say that Lord Roberts and those who agree with him ask for\r\nnational training such as is willingly and cheerfully undergone by the\r\ncitizens of Switzerland, not for that which is imposed on the German\r\npopulation.  We have one more word to say--that is, to ask our readers\r\nto study carefully Lord Roberts' book.  We would specially ask this of\r\nthose who dread, and, as we hold, are right in dreading, militarism,\r\nand who look forward to universal peace as the ultimate goal for\r\nmankind.  They will find that Lord Roberts has not a word to say in\r\npraise of war....  What he does desire is that as long as war\r\ncontinues--and no sane man can, unfortunately, doubt its continuance in\r\nour generation--the British people shall, when it comes, be prepared to\r\nmeet it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RISE AND EXPANSION OF THE BRITISH DOMINION IN INDIA.

By E. F. Knight.  Author of \"Where Three Empires Meet,\"\r\n\"Small Boat Sailing,\" etc.  With 9 Coloured Maps.  Crown 8vo.  6s.\r\n\r\nMr. E. F. Knight, the well-known traveller and war correspondent, in\r\nthis volume gives a description of what he calls the Nearer\r\nEmpire--_i.e._, the British possessions in the Mediterranean, Africa,\r\nand America.  The book is no mere collection of geographical facts.  It\r\nseeks to show what the Empire is, how it came to be, and what is the\r\nhistory of its growth.  It deals also with the political development\r\nand the economic resources of the Colonies.  The descriptive parts have\r\nan additional charm through being to a large extent a record of\r\npersonal observation.  To quote from the Preface:--\"The author has\r\ntravelled in most of the countries over which the British flag flies.\r\nHe has witnessed, and on some occasions taken part in the making of\r\nseveral portions of that Empire in times both of peace and war, and has\r\ntherefore been able to draw on his own personal experiences and\r\nobservations when writing this short account of Britain beyond the\r\nseas.\"",
