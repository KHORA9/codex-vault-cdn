Here he retired to the woods, built\r\nhimself a \"Pavillion of boughs\" and lived chiefly on venison, \"his\r\nexercise a good horse, with his lance and Ring,\" his books Macchiavelli's\r\n\"Art of War\" and Marcus Aurelius. Tiring of this life after a short time\r\nhe returned to the Low Countries and began the adventurous career of which\r\nhe gives such an enthralling description in his \"True Travels, Adventures\r\nand Observations.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1605 he returned to England, and the next year prepared to join an\r\nexpedition to Guiana but the scheme was frustrated by the death of the\r\nintended leader, Charles Lee. On 19th December 1606 he sailed from\r\nBlackwall with the Colonists for Virginia. For the next three years he was\r\nbusily employed, as his \"Generall Historie of Virginia\" witnesses, in\r\nfounding the Colony; in September 1609 he narrowly escaped death by the\r\naccidental explosion of a bag of gun-powder, and left for England to\r\nrecruit his health.

The question as to the truth of the\r\nadventures recorded in this book has given rise to heated and prolonged\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\r\nSmith was a prolific writer of tracts and pamphlets on the colonisation of\r\nVirginia and New England, but the substance of them is contained in \"The\r\nGenerall Historie\" and \"The True Travels.\"\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the scheme of this series, the edition here presented\r\nis an exact reprint of the Original Editions except that the letters i, j,\r\nu and v have been altered to conform to modern usage, and obvious\r\nprinters' errors, both of spelling and punctuation, have been corrected.\r\nReferences to the pages of the original editions are given in the margin,\r\nand a full index has been added.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Glasgow,\r\n  February, 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS AND MOST NOBLE\r\n                            PRINCESSE,\r\n                        THE LADY FRANCIS,\r\n\r\n                 Duchesse of Richmond and Lenox.\r\n\r\n\r\nMay it please your Grace,\r\n\r\nThis History, as for the raritie and varietie of the subject, so much more\r\nfor the judicious Eyes it is like to undergoe, and most of all for that\r\ngreat Name, whereof it dareth implore Protection, might and ought to have\r\nbeene clad in better robes then my rude military hand can cut out in Paper\r\nOrnaments. But because, of the most things therein, I am no Compiler by\r\nhearsay, but have beene a reall Actor; I take my selfe to have a propertie\r\nin them: and therefore have beene bold to challenge them to come under the\r\nreach of my owne rough Pen. That, which hath beene indured and passed\r\nthrough with hardship and danger, is thereby sweetned to the Actor, when he\r\nbecometh the Relator. I have deeply hazarded my selfe in doing and\r\nsuffering, and why should I sticke to hazard my reputation in Recording?\r\nHe that acteth two parts is the more borne withall if he come short, or\r\nfayle in one of them. Where shall we looke to finde a Julius Caesar, whose\r\nachievments shine as cleare in his owne Commentaries, as they did in the\r\nfield? I confesse, my hand, though able to weild a weapon among the\r\nBarbarous, yet well may tremble in handling a Pen among so many Judicious:\r\nespecially when I am so bold as to call so piercing, and so glorious an\r\nEye, as your Grace, to view these poore ragged lines.\r\n\r\nYet my comfort is, that heretofore honorable and vertuous Ladies, and\r\ncomparable but amongst themselves, have offred me rescue and protection in\r\nmy greatest dangers: even in forraine parts, I have felt reliefe from that\r\nsex. The beauteous Lady Tragabigzanda, when I was a slave to the Turkes,\r\ndid all she could to secure me. When I overcame the Bashaw of Nalbrits in\r\nTartaria, the charitable Lady Callamata supplyed my necessities. In the\r\nutmost of many extremities, that blessed Pokahontas, the great Kings\r\ndaughter of Virginia, oft saved my life. When I escaped the crueltie of\r\nPirats and most furious stormes, a long time alone in a small Boat at Sea,\r\nand driven ashore in France, the good Lady Madam Chanoyes, bountifully\r\nassisted me.\r\n\r\nAnd so verily these my adventures have tasted the same influence from your\r\nGratious hand, which hath given birth to the publication of this\r\nNarration. If therefore your Grace shall daigne to cast your eye on this\r\npoore Booke, view I pray you rather your owne Bountie (without which it\r\nhad dyed in the wombe) then my imperfections, which have no helpe but the\r\nshrine of your glorious Name to be sheltered from censorious condemnation.\r\nVouchsafe some glimpse of your honorable aspect, to accept these my\r\nlabours; to protect them under the shadow of your excellent Name: which\r\nwill inable them to be presented to the Kings royall Majestie, the most\r\nadmired Prince Charles, and the Queene of Bohemia: your sweet\r\nRecommendations will make it the worthier of their good countenances. And\r\nas all my endevours are their due tribute: so this Page shall record to\r\nposteritie, that my service shall be to pray to God, that you may still\r\ncontinue the renowned of your sexe, the most honored of men, and the\r\nhighly blessed of God.\r\n\r\n                                   Your Graces faithfull\r\n                                        and devoted servant,\r\n                                                   JOHN SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          A Preface of foure Poynts.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.    This plaine History humbly sheweth the truth: that our most royall\r\n      King James hath place and opportunitie to inlarge his ancient\r\n      Dominions without wronging any; (which is a condition most agreeable\r\n      to his most just and pious resolutions:) and the Prince his Highness\r\n      may see where to plant new Colonies. The gaining Provinces addeth to\r\n      the Kings Crown: but the reducing Heathen people to civilitie and\r\n      true Religion, bringeth honour to the King of Heaven. If his Princely\r\n      wisedome and powerfull hand, renowned through the world for admirable\r\n      government, please but to set these new Estates into order; their\r\n      composure will be singular: the counsell of divers is confused; the\r\n      generall Stocke is consumed; nothing but the touch of the Kings\r\n      sacred hand can erect a Monarchy.\r\n\r\nII.   Most noble Lords and worthy Gentlemen, it is your Honors that have\r\n      imployed great paines and large expence in laying the foundation of\r\n      this State, wherein much hath beene buried under ground, yet some\r\n      thing hath sprung up, and given you a taste of your adventures. Let\r\n      no difficulties alter your noble intentions. The action is an honour\r\n      to your Country: and the issue may well reimburse you your summes\r\n      expended. Our practices have hitherto beene but assayes, and are\r\n      still to be amended. Let your bountie supply the necessities of weake\r\n      beginnings, and your excellent judgements rectifie the proceedings;\r\n      the returne cannot choose in the end but bring you good Commodities,\r\n      and good contentments, by your advancing shipping and fishing so\r\n      usefull unto our Nation.\r\n\r\nIII.  Yee valiant and generous spirits, personall possessors of these\r\n      new-found Territories, banish from among you Cowardise, covetousnes,\r\n      jealousies, and idlenes, enemies to the raising your honours and\r\n      fortunes; vertue, industry, and amitie, will make you good and\r\n      great, and your merits live to ensuing Ages. You that in contempt of\r\n      necessities, hazard your lives and estates, imploying your studies\r\n      and labours in these faire endevours, live and prosper as I desire my\r\n      soule should prosper.\r\n\r\nIIII. For my selfe let emulation and envie cease, I ever intended my\r\n      actions should be upright: now my care hath beene that my Relations\r\n      should give every man they concerne, their due. But had I not\r\n      discovered and lived in the most of those parts. I could not\r\n      possibly have collected the substantiall truth from such a number of\r\n      variable Relations, that would have made a Volume at least of a\r\n      thousand sheets.

Returning home and relating what pleasant and fruitfull\r\nCountries he had seene without Inhabitants, and for what barren ground his\r\nbrethren and kindred did murther one another, he provided a number of\r\nShips, and got with him such men and women as were desirous to live in\r\nquietnesse, that arrived with him in this new Land in the yeare 1170:\r\nLeft many of his people there and returned for more. But where this place\r\nwas no History can show.\r\n\r\n                             A.D. 1492.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards say Hanno a Prince of Carthage was the first: and the next\r\nChristopher Cullumbus, a Genoesiar, whom they sent to discover those\r\nunknowne parts, 1492.\r\n\r\n                             A.D. 1497.\r\n\r\nBut we finde by Records, Cullumbus offered his service in the yeare 1488.\r\nto King Henry the seaventh; and by accident undertooke it for the\r\nSpanyards. In the Interim King Henry gave a Commission to John Cabot, and\r\nhis three sonnes, Sebastian, Lewis, and Sautius. John and Sebastian well\r\nprovided, setting sayle, ranged a great part of this unknowne world, in\r\nthe yeare 1497. For though Cullumbus had found certaine Iles, it was 1498.\r\nere he saw the Continent, which was a yeare after Cabot. Now Americus came\r\na long time after, though the whole Continent to this day is called\r\nAmerica after his name, yet Sebastian Cabot discovered much more then them\r\nall, for he sayled to about forty degrees Southward of the lyne, and to\r\nsixty-seaven towards the North: for which King Henry the eight Knighted\r\nhim and made him grand Pilate of England. Being very aged King Edward the\r\nsixt gave him a Pention of 1661. 13s. 4d. yearely. By his directions Sir\r\nHugh Willowby was sent to finde out the Country of Russia, but the next\r\nyeare he was found frozen to death in his Ship, and all his Company.\r\n\r\n                             A.D. 1576.\r\n\r\nMr. Martin Frobisher was sent in the yeare 1576. by our most gracious\r\nQueene Elizabeth, to search for the Northwest passage, and Meta incognita:\r\nfor which he was Knighted, honored, and well rewarded.\r\n\r\n                             A.D. 1583.\r\n\r\nSir Humphrey Gilbert a worthy Knight attempted a Plantation in some of\r\nthose parts: and obtained Letters Pattents to his desire: but with this\r\nProviso, He should [1.2.] maintaine possession in some of those vast\r\nCountries within the tearme of sixe yeares. Yet when he was provided with\r\na Navy able to incounter a Kings power, even here at home they fell in\r\ndivisions, and so into confusion, that they gave over the Designe ere\r\nit was begun, notwithstanding all this losse, his undanted spirit began\r\nagaine, but his Fleet fell with New-foundland, and he perished in his\r\nreturne, as at large you may read in the third Volume of the English\r\nVoyages, written by Mr. Hackluit.\r\n\r\nUpon all those Relations and inducements, Sir Walter Raleigh, a noble\r\nGentleman, and then in great esteeme, undertooke to send to discover to\r\nthe Southward. And though his occasions and other imployments were such he\r\ncould not goe himselfe, yet he procured her Majesties Letters Pattents,\r\nand perswaded many worthy Knights and Gentlemen to adventure with him to\r\nfinde a place fit for a Plantation. Their Proceedings followeth.\r\n\r\n                             A.D. 1584.\r\n\r\nThe most famous, renowned, and ever worthy of all memory, for her courage,\r\nlearning, judgement, and vertue, Queene Elizabeth, granted her Letters\r\nPatents to Sir Walter Raleigh for the discovering and planting new Lands\r\n& Countries, not actually possessed by any Christians. This Patenty got to\r\nbe his assistants Sir Richard Grenvell the valiant, Mr. William Sanderson\r\na great friend to all such noble and worthy actions, and divers other\r\nGentlemen and Marchants, who with all speede provided two small Barkes\r\nwell furnished with all necessaries, under the command of Captaine Philip\r\nAmidas and Captaine Barlow. The 27. of Aprill they set sayle from the\r\nThames, the tenth of May passed the Canaries, and the tenth of June the\r\nWest Indies: which unneedfull Southerly course, (but then no better was\r\nknowne) occasioned them in that season much sicknesse.\r\n\r\n                          _Their arrival._\r\n                       _Abundance of Grapes_ {MN}\r\n\r\nThe second of July they fell with the coast of Florida in shoule water,\r\nwhere they felt a most dilicate sweete smell, though they saw no land,\r\nwhich ere long they espied, thinking it the Continent: an hundred and\r\ntwenty myles they sayled not finding any harbor. The first that appeared,\r\nwith much difficulty they entred, and anchored, and after thankes to God\r\nthey went to view the next Land adjoyning to take possession of it for the\r\nQueenes most excellent Majestie: which done, they found their first\r\nlanding place very sandy and low, {MN} but so full of grapes that the very\r\nsurge of the Sea sometimes over-flowed them: of which they found such\r\nplenty in all places, both on the sand, the greene soyle and hils, as in\r\nthe plaines as well on every little shrub, as also climbing towards the\r\ntops of high Cedars, that they did thinke in the world were not the like\r\nabundance.\r\n\r\n                          _The Ile of Wokokon._\r\n                     _In Lybanus are not many._ {MN-1}\r\n                    _Conference with a Salvage._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nWe passed by the Sea-side towards the tops of the next hills being not\r\nhigh: from whence we might see the Sea on both sides, and found it an Ile\r\nof twentie myles in length, and six in breadth, the vallyes replenished\r\nwith goodly tall Cedars, Discharging our Muskets, such a flocke of Cranes,\r\nthe most white, arose by us, with such a cry as if an Army of men had\r\nshouted altogether. This He hath many goodly Woods, and Deere, Conies, and\r\nFoule in incredible abundance, and using the Authors owne phrase, the\r\nWoods are not such as you finde in Bohemia, Moscovia, or Hercinia, barren\r\nand fruitlesse, but the highest and reddest Cedars of the world, {MN-1}\r\nbettering them of the Assores, Indies, or Libanus: Pynes, Cypres,\r\nSaxefras, the Lentisk that beareth Mastick, and many other of excellent\r\nsmell and qualitie. Till the third day we saw not any of the people, then\r\nin a little Boat three of them appeared, one of them went on shore, to\r\nwhom wee rowed, and he attended us without any signe of feare; {MN-2}\r\nafter he had spoke much though we understood not a word, of his owne\r\naccord he came boldly aboord us, we gave him a shirt, a hat, wine and\r\nmeate, which he liked well, and after he had well viewed the barkes and\r\nus, he went away in his owne Boat, and within a quarter of a myle of us in\r\nhalfe an houre, had loaden his Boat with fish, with which he came againe\r\nto the poynt of land, and there devided it in two parts, poynting one part\r\nto the Ship, the other to the Pinnace, and so departed.\r\n\r\n                            A.D. 1584.\r\n              [I.3] _The Arrival of the Kings brother._\r\n\r\nThe next day came divers Boats, and in one of them the Kings Brother, with\r\nforty or fifty men, proper people, and in their behaviour very civill; his\r\nname was Granganameo, the King is called Wingina, the Country Wingandacoa.\r\nLeaving his Boats a little from our Ships, he came with his trayne to the\r\npoynt: where spreading a Matte he sat downe. Though we came to him well\r\narmed, he made signes to us to sit downe without any shew of feare,\r\nstroking his head and brest, and also ours, to expresse his love. After he\r\nhad made a long speech unto us, we presented him with divers toyes, which\r\nhe kindly accepted. He was greatly regarded by his people, for none of\r\nthem did sit, nor speake a word, but foure, on whom we bestowed presents\r\nalso, but he tooke all from them, making signes all things did belong to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe King himselfe in a conflict with a King his next neighbour and mortall\r\nenemy, was shot in two places through the body, and the thigh, yet\r\nrecovered: whereby he lay at his chiefe towne six dayes journey from\r\nthence.\r\n\r\n                     _Trade with the Salvages._\r\n\r\nA day or two after shewing them what we had, Granganameo taking most\r\nliking to a Pewter dish, made a hole in it, hung it about his necke for a\r\nbrest-plate: for which he gave us twenty Deere skins, worth twenty\r\nCrownes; and for a Copper Kettell, fiftie skins, worth fiftie Crownes.\r\nMuch other trucke we had, and after two dayes he came aboord, and did eate\r\nand drinke with us very merrily. Not long after he brought his wife and\r\nchildren, they were but of meane stature, but well favoured and very\r\nbashfull; she had a long coat of Leather, and about her privities a peece\r\nof the same, about her forehead a band of white Corrall, and so had her\r\nhusband, in her eares were bracelets of pearle, hanging downe to her\r\nmiddle, of the bignesse of great Pease; the rest of the women had Pendants\r\nof Copper, and the Noblemen five or sixe in an eare; his apparrell as his\r\nwives, onely the women weare their haire long on both sides, and the men\r\nbut on one; they are of colour yellow, but their hayre is blacke, yet we\r\nsaw children that had very fayre Chesnut coloured hayre.\r\n\r\n                              _Note_ {MN}\r\n\r\nAfter that these women had beene here with us, there came downe from all\r\nparts great store of people, with Leather, Corrall, and divers kinde of\r\ndyes, but when Granganameo was present, none durst trade but himselfe, and\r\nthem that wore red Copper on their heads, as he did. When ever he came, he\r\nwould signifie by so many fires he came with so many boats, that we might\r\nknow his strength. Their Boats are but one great tree, which is but burnt\r\nin the forme of a trough with gins and fire, till it be as they would have\r\nit. For an armour he would have ingaged us a bagge of pearle, but we\r\nrefused, as not regarding it, that wee might the better learn where it\r\ngrew. He was very just of his promise, for oft we trusted him, and he\r\nwould come within his day to keepe his word. He sent us commonly every day\r\na brace of Bucks, Conies, Hares, and fish, sometimes Mellons, Walnuts,\r\nCucumbers, Pease, and divers rootes. {MN} This the Author sayth, their\r\ncorne groweth three times in five moneths; in May they sow, in July reape;\r\nin June they sow, in August reape; in July sow, in August reape. We put\r\nsome of our Pease in the ground, which in ten dayes were 14. ynches high.\r\n\r\n                      _The Ile Roanoak._ {MN-1}\r\n                _The Great courtesie of a Woman._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nThe soyle is most plentifull, sweete, wholesome, and fruitfull of all\r\nother, there are about 14. severall sorts of sweete smelling tymber trees:\r\nthe most parts of the underwood, Bayes and such like: such Okes as we,\r\nbut far greater and better. After this acquaintance, my selfe with seaven\r\nmore went twenty myle into the River Occam, that runneth toward the Cittie\r\nSkicoack, {MN-1} and the evening following we came to an Ile called\r\nRoanoak, from the harbour where we entred 7. leagues; at the North end was\r\n9. houses, builded with Cedar, fortified round with sharpe trees, and the\r\nentrance like a Turnpik. When we came towards it, {MN-2} the wife of\r\nGranganameo came running out to meete us, (her husband was absent)\r\ncommanding her people to draw our Boat ashore for beating on the billowes,\r\nother she appoynted to carry us on their backes aland, others to bring our\r\nOres into the [I.4.] house for stealing. When we came into the other roome,\r\n(for there was five in the house) she caused us to sit downe by a great\r\nfire; after tooke off our clothes and washed them, of some our stockings,\r\nand some our feete in warme water, and she her selfe tooke much paines to\r\nsee all things well ordered, and to provide us victuall.\r\n\r\n                            _A Banquet._\r\n                     _Skicoak a great towne._ {MN}\r\n\r\nAfter we had thus dryed our selves, she brought us into an Inner roome,\r\nwhere she set on the bord standing a long the house somewhat like\r\nfrumentie, sodden venison, and rosted fish; in like manner mellons raw,\r\nboyled rootes and fruites of divers kindes. There drinke is commonly water\r\nboyled with Ginger, sometimes with Saxefras, and wholsome herbes, but\r\nwhilest the Grape lasteth they drinke wine. More love she could not\r\nexpresse to entertaine us; they care but onely to defend themselves from\r\nthe short winter, and feede on what they finde naturall in sommer. In this\r\nfeasting house was their Idoll of whom they tould us uncredible things.\r\nWhen we were at meate two or three of her men came amongst us with their\r\nBowes and Arrowes, which caused us to take our armes in hand. She\r\nperceiving our distrust, caused their Bowes and Arrowes to be broken, and\r\nthey beaten out of the gate: but the evening approaching we returned to\r\nour boate, where at she much grieving brought our supper halfe boyled,\r\npots and all, but when she saw us, but put our boat a little off from the\r\nshoar and lye at Anchor, perceiving our Jelousie, she sent divers men\r\n& 30. women to sit al night on the shoare side against us, and sent us\r\nfive Mats to cover us from the raine, doing all she could to perswade us\r\nto her house. Though there was no cause of doubt, we would not adventure:\r\nfor on our safety depended the voyage: but a more kinde loving people\r\ncannot be. Beyond this Ile is the maine land and the great river Occam, on\r\nwhich standeth a Towne called Pomeiock, {MN} and six dayes higher, their\r\nCity Skicoak: those people never saw it, but say there fathers affirme it\r\nto be above two houres journey about. Into this river falleth an other\r\ncalled Cipo, where is found many Mustells wherein are Pearles: likewise\r\nanother River called Nomapona, on the one side whereof standeth a great\r\ntowne called Chawanock, the Lord of the Country is not subject to\r\nWingandacoa. Beyond him an other king they cal Menatonon. These 3. are in\r\nleague each with other. Towards the south, 4. dayes journey is Sequotan,\r\nthe southermost part of Wingandacoa.\r\n\r\n                                 _Pamovik._\r\n                  _How the Country was called Virginia._ {MN}\r\n\r\nAdjoyning to Secotan beginneth the country Pomovik, belonging to the King\r\ncalled Piamacum, in the Country Nusiok upon the great river Neus. These\r\nhave mortall warres with Wingina, King of Wingandacoa. Betwixt Piamacum\r\nand the Lord of Secotan, a peace was concluded: notwithstanding there is a\r\nmortall malice in the Secotans, because this Piamacum invited divers men,\r\nand 30. women to a feast, and when they were altogether merry before their\r\nIdoll, which is but a meere illusion of the Devill, they sudainly slew all\r\nthe men of Secotan, and kept the women for their use. Beyond Roanoak are\r\nmany Isles full of fruits and other Naturall increases, with many Townes a\r\nlong the side of the Continent. Those Iles lye 200. myles in length, and\r\nbetweene them and the mayne, a great long sea, in some places, 20. 40. or\r\n50. myles broad, in other more, somewhere lesse. And in this sea are 100.\r\nIles of divers bignesses, but to get into it, you have but 3. passages and\r\nthey very dangerous. Though this you see for most part be but the\r\nrelations of Salvages, because it is the first, I thought it not a misse\r\nto remember them as they are written by them that returned & arived in\r\nEngland about the middest of September the same yeare. This discovery was\r\nso welcome into England that it pleased her Majestie to call this Country\r\nof Wingandacoa, Virginia, by which name now you are to understand how it\r\nwas planted, disolved, reuned, and enlarged.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Performers of this voyage were these following.\r\n\r\n                       Philip Amadas. }\r\n                       Arthur Barlow. } Captaines\r\n\r\n     William Grenvill.

The 14. day we fell with the\r\nCanaries, and the 7. of May with Dominico in the West Indies: we landed at\r\nPortorico, after with much a doe at Izabella on the north of Hispaniola,\r\npassing by many Iles. Upon the 20. we fell with the mayne of Florida, and\r\nwere put in great danger upon Cape Fear. The 26. we Anchored at Wocokon,\r\nwhere the admiral had like to beene cast away, presently we sent to\r\nWingina to Roanoak, and Master Arundel went to the mayne, with Manteo a\r\nsalvage, and that day to Crooton. The 11. The Generall victualled for 8.\r\ndayes, with a selected company went to the maine, and discovered the\r\nTownes of Pomeiok, Aquascogoc, Secotan, and the great Lake called Paquipe.\r\nAt Aquascogoc the Indians stole a silver Cup, wherefore we burnt the Towne\r\nand spoyled their corne, so returned to our fleete at Tocokon. Whence we\r\nwayed for Hatorask, where we rested, and Granganameo, King Wingina's\r\nbrother with Manteo came abord our Admirall, the Admirall went for\r\nWeapomeiok, & Master John Arundel for England. Our Generall in his way\r\nhome tooke a rich loaden ship of 300. tunns, with which he arived at\r\nPlimouth the 18. of September, 1585.\r\n\r\nThese were left under the command of Master Ralph Layne to inhabite the\r\nCountry, but they returned within a yeare.\r\n\r\n    Philip Amidas Admirall.

The utmost of our discovery Southward was Secotan as we\r\nesteemed 80. leagues from Roanoack. The passage from thence was thought a\r\nbroad sound within the maine, being without kenning of land, yet full of\r\nflats and shoules that our Pinnasse could not passe, & we had but one boat\r\nwith 4. ores, that would carry but 15. men with their provisions for 7.\r\ndayes: so that because the winter approached we left those discoveries\r\ntill a stronger supply. To the Northward our farthest was to a Towne of\r\nthe Chesapeacks, from Roanoack 130. myles. The passage is very shallow and\r\ndangerous by reason of the breadth of the sound and the little succour\r\nfor a storme, but this teritory being 15. myle from the shoare, for\r\npleasantnest of seate, for temperature of climate, fertility of soyle and\r\ncomoditie of the Sea, besides beares, good woods, Saxefras, Walnuts &c. is\r\nnot to be excelled by any other whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThere be sundry other Kings they call Weroances as the Mangoacks,\r\nTrypaniks, and Opposians, which came to visit us.\r\n\r\n                        _Chawonoack._ [I.6]\r\n\r\nTo the northwest our farthest was Chawonock from Roanoack 130. myles our\r\npassage lyeth through a broad sound, but all fresh water, and the channell\r\nNavigable for a Ship, but out of it full of shoules.\r\n\r\n                       _Chawonock._ {MN-1}\r\n                        700. _men._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nThe townes by the way by the water, are Passaquenock the womens towne,\r\nChepanoc, Weapomeiok; from Muscamunge wee enter the river and jurisdiction\r\nof Chawonock, there it beginneth to straiten, and at Chawonock it is as\r\nThames at Lambeth: betwixt them as we passed is goodly high land on the\r\nleft hand, and there is a towne called Ohanock, where is a great corne\r\nfield, {MN-1} it is subject to Chawonock, which is the greatest Province\r\nupon the river, {MN-2} and the Towne it selfe can put seven hundred men\r\ninto the field, besides the forces of the rest. The King is lame, but hath\r\nmore understanding then all the rest.\r\n\r\n    _Menatonon his relations of the Ile of Pearle, and a rich mine, &\r\n                        the Sea by it._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThe river of Moratoc is more famous then all the rest, and openeth into\r\nthe sound of Weapomeiok, and where there is but a very small currant in\r\nChawonock, it hath so strong a currant from the Southwest, as we doubted\r\nhow to row against it. Strange things they report of the head of this\r\nriver, and of Moratoc it selfe, a principall towne on it, & is thirtie or\r\nfortie dayes Journey to the head. This lame King is called Menatonon. {MN}\r\nWhen I had him prisoner two dayes, he told mee that 3. dayes Journey in a\r\nCanow up the river Chawonock, then landing & going foure dayes Journey\r\nNortheast, there is a King whose Country lyeth on the Sea, but his best\r\nplace of strength is an Iland in a Bay invironed with deepe water, where\r\nhe taketh that abundance of Pearle, that not onely his skins, and his\r\nnobles, but also his beds and houses are garnished therewith. This king\r\nwas at Chawonock two yeares agoe to trade with blacke pearle, his worst\r\nsort whereof I had a rope, but they were naught; but that King he sayth\r\nhath store of white, and had trafficke with white men, for whom he\r\nreserved them; he promised me guides to him, but advised me to goe strong,\r\nfor he was unwilling strangers should come in his Country, for his Country\r\nis populous and valiant men. If a supply had come in Aprill, I resolved to\r\nhave sent a small Barke to the Northward to have found it, whilest I with\r\nsmall Boates and 200. men would have gone to the head of the river\r\nChawonock, with sufficient guides by land, inskonsing my selfe every two\r\ndayes, where I would leave Garrisons for my retreat till I came to this\r\nBay.\r\n\r\nVery neare unto it is the river of Moratoc, directly from the West, the\r\nhead of it springeth out of a mayne Rocke, which standeth so neare the\r\nSea, that in stormes the Sea beats over it into this fresh spring, that of\r\nit selfe at the surse is a violent streame. I intended with two Wherries\r\nand fortie persons to have Menatonons sonne for guide, to try this\r\npresently, till I could meete with some of the Moratocks, or Mangoaks, but\r\nhoping of getting more victuall from the Salvages, we as narrowly escaped\r\nstarving in that Discovery as ever men did.\r\n\r\n                    _Pemissapan his trechery._\r\n            _The discovery of the river Moratoc._ {MN-1}\r\n                  _A noble resolution._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nFor Pemissapan who had changed his name of Wingina upon the death of his\r\nbrother Granganameo, had given both the Chawonests, and Mangoaks word of\r\nmy purpose: also he told me the Chawonocks had assembled two or three\r\nthousand to assault me at Roanok, urging me daily to goe against them, and\r\nthem against us; {MN-1} a great assembly I found at my comming thether,\r\nwhich suddaine approach did so dismay them, that we had the better of\r\nthem: & this confederacy against us was procured by Pemissapan himselfe\r\nour chiefe friend we trusted; he sent word also to the Moratoks and the\r\nMangoaks, I came to invade them, that they all fled up into the high\r\nCountry, so that where I assured my selfe both of succour and provision, I\r\nfound all abandoned. But being thus farre on my journey 160. myles from\r\nhome, and but victuals for two dayes, besides the casualties of crosse\r\nwinds, stormes, and the Salvages trechery, though we intended no hurt to\r\nany: I gave my Company to understand we were onely drawne forth upon these\r\nvaine hopes by the Salvages to bring us to confusion: {MN-2} a Councell we\r\nheld, to goe forward or returne, but they all were absolutely resolved but\r\nthree, that whilst there was but one pynt of Corne for a man, they would\r\nnot leave the search of that river; for they had two Mastive Dogs, which\r\nboyled with Saxefras leaves [I.7.] (if the worst fell out) upon them and\r\nthe pottage they would live two dayes, which would bring them to the\r\nsound, where they should finde fish for two dayes more to passe it to\r\nRoanock, which two dayes they had rather fast then goe backe a foote, till\r\nthey had seene the Mangoaks either as friends or foes.\r\n\r\n             _The strange Mine of Chaunis Temoatan._\r\n\r\nThough I did forsee the danger and misery, yet the desire I had to see the\r\nMangoaks was, for that there is a province called Chaunis Temoatan,\r\nfrequented by them and well knowne to all those Countries, where is a mine\r\nof Copper they call Wassador; they say they take it out of a river that\r\nfalleth swiftly from high rocks in shallow water, in great Bowles, covered\r\nwith leather, leaving a part open to receive the mettall, which by the\r\nchange of the colour of the water where the spout falleth, they suddainly\r\nchop downe, and have the Bowie full, which they cast into the fire, it\r\npresently melteth, and doth yeeld in five parts at the first melting two\r\nparts mettall for three of Ore. The Mangoaks have such plenty of it, they\r\nbeautifie their houses with great plates thereof: this the Salvages\r\nreport; and young Skiko the King of Chawonnocks sonne my prisoner, that\r\nhad beene prisoner among the Mangoaks, but never at Chaunis Temoatan, for\r\nhe sayd that was twentie dayes journey overland from the Mangoaks.\r\n\r\n          _The great current of the river Moratoc._ {MN}\r\n\r\nMenatonon also confirmed all this, and promised me guides to this mettall\r\nCountry; by Land to the Mangoaks is but one dayes journey, but seaven by\r\nwater, which made me so willing to have met them for some assay of this\r\nmetall: but when we came there we found no creature, onely we might see\r\nwhere had beene their fires. After our two dayes journey, and our victuals\r\nspent, in the evening we heard some call as we thought Manteo, who was\r\nwith me in the boat; this made us glad, he made them a friendly answer,\r\nwhich they answered with a song we thought for welcome, but he told us\r\nthey came to fight. Presently they did let flie their Arrowes about the\r\nboat, but did no hurt, the other boat scouring the shore we landed: but\r\nthey all were fled, and how to finde them wee knew not. So the next\r\nmorning we returned to the mouth of the river, {MN} that cost us foure\r\ndayes rowing up, and here our dogs pottage stood us in good stead, for we\r\nhad nothing els: the next day we fasted being windbound, and could not\r\npasse the sound, but the day following we came to Chippanum, where the\r\npeople were fled, but their wires afforded us fish: thus being neare\r\nspent, the next day God brought us to Roanocke. I conclude a good Mine, or\r\nthe South sea will make this Country quickly inhabited, and so for\r\npleasure and profit comparable with any in the world: otherwise there will\r\nbe nothing worth the fetching. Provided there be found a better harbour\r\nthen yet there is, which must be Northward if there be any. Master\r\nVaughan, no lesse hoped of the goodnesse of the Mine, then Master Heriot\r\nthat the river Moratocks head, either riseth by the Bay of Mexico, or very\r\nneare the South Sea, or some part that openeth neare the same, which\r\ncannot with that facilitie be done as from the Bay of Pearles, by\r\ninsconsing foure dayes journey to the Chawonoks, Mangoaks, and Moratocks,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The conspiracy of Pemissapan; the Discovery of it; and our returne for\r\n    England with Sir Francis Drake.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _The Conspiricy of Pemissapan._ {MN-1}\r\n              _The death of a most rare Salvage._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nEnsenore a Salvage, father to Pemissapan, the best friend we had after the\r\ndeath of Granganimeo, when I was in those Discoveries, could not prevaile\r\nany thing with the King from destroying us, that all this time God had\r\npreserved, by his good counsell to the King to be friendly unto us. {MN-1}\r\nPemissapan thinking as the brute was in this last journey we were slaine\r\nand starved, began to blaspheme our God that would suffer it, and not\r\ndefend us, so that old Ensenore, had no more credit for us: for he began\r\nby all the devises he could to invade us. But in the beginning of this\r\nbrute, when [I.8.] they saw us all returne, the report false, and had\r\nManteo, and three Salvages more with us, how little we esteemed all the\r\npeople we met, and feared neither hunger, killing, or any thing, and had\r\nbrought their greatest Kings sonne prisoner with us to Roanock: it a\r\nlittle asswaged all his devises, and brought Ensenore in respect againe,\r\nthat our God was good, and wee their friends, and our foes should perish,\r\nfor we could doe them more hurt being dead, then living, and that being an\r\nhundred myles from them, shot, and strucke them sicke to death, and that\r\nwhen we die it is but for a time, then we returne againe. But that which\r\nwrought the most feare among them was the handy-worke of Almightie God.\r\nFor certaine dayes after my returne, Menatonon sent messengers to me with\r\nPearle, and Okisco King of Weopomeoke, to yeeld himselfe servant to the\r\nQueene of England. Okisco with twenty-foure of his principall men came to\r\nPemissapan to acknowledge this dutie and subjection, and would performe\r\nit. All which so changed the heart of Pemissapan, that upon the advise of\r\nEnsenore, when we were ready to famish they came and made us wires, and\r\nplanted their fields they intended to abandon (we not having one corne\r\ntill the next harvest to sustaine us). {MN-2} This being done our old\r\nfriend Ensenore dyed the twenty of Aprill, then all our enemies wrought\r\nwith Pemissapan to put in practise his devises, which he easily imbraced,\r\nthough they had planted corne by us, and at Dasamonpeack two leagues from\r\nus. Yet they got Okisco our tributary to get seven or eight hundred (and\r\nthe Mandoages with the Chisapeans should doe the like) to meete (as their\r\ncustome is) to solemnize the Funerall of Ensenore. Halfe of whom should\r\nlye hid, to cut off the straglers, seeking crabs and provision: the rest\r\ncome out of the mayne upon the Signall by fire. Twenty of the principall\r\nof Pemissapans men had charge in the night to beset my house, put fire in\r\nthe Reeds that covered it, which might cause me run out so naked and\r\namazed, they might without danger knocke out my braines. The same order\r\nfor Mr. Heriots, and the rest: for all should have beene fired at an\r\ninstant. In the meane time they should sell us nothing, and in the night\r\nspoyle our wires, to make necessitie disperse us. For if we were but ten\r\ntogether, a hundred of them would not meddle with us. So our famine\r\nincreased, I was forced to send Captaine Stafford to Croatan, with twentie\r\nto feed himselfe, and see if he could espie any sayle passe the coast; Mr.\r\nPredeox with ten to Hatarask upon the same occasion: and other small\r\nparties to the Mayne to live upon rootes and Oysters.\r\n\r\n               _A slaughter of two Salvages._ {MN-1}\r\n             _Pemissipan slaine and 8. others._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nPemissapan sequestring himselfe, I should not importune him for victuall,\r\nand to draw his troupes, found not the Chawonests so forward as he\r\nexpected, being a people more faithfull and powerfull, and desired our\r\nfriendships, and was offended with him for raising such tales, and all his\r\nprojects were revealed to me by Skico my prisoner; who finding himselfe as\r\nwell used by me, as Pemissapan tould me all. These troubles caused me send\r\nto Pemissapan, to put suspition in his head, I was to goe presently to\r\nCroatan to meete a Fleete came to me, though I knew no such matter: and\r\nthat he would lend me men to fish and hunt. He sent me word he would come\r\nhimselfe to Roanock; but delaying time eight dayes that all his men were\r\nthere to be assembled, not liking so much company, I resolved the next day\r\nto goe visit him, but first to give them in the Ile a Canvisado, and at an\r\ninstant to seaze on all their Canows about the Ile. But the towne tooke\r\nthe Alarum before I ment it. {MN-1} For when I sent to take the Canows, he\r\nmet one going from the shore, overthrew her and cut off two Salvages\r\nheads; whereupon the cry arose, being by their spyes perceived: for they\r\nkept as good watch over us, as we of them. Upon this they to their Bowes,\r\nand we to our Armes: three or foure of them at the first were slaine, the\r\nrest fled into the woods. The next morning I went to Dassamonpeack, and\r\nsent Pemissapan word I was going to Croatan, and tooke him in my way to\r\ncomplaine Osocon would have stole my prisoner Skico. Hereupon he did abide\r\nmy comming, & being among eight of the principallest, I gave the watchword\r\nto my men, and immediately they had that they purposed for us. {MN-2}\r\nHimselfe being shot through with a Pistoll fell downe as dead, but\r\npresently start up and ran away from them all, till an Irish Boy shot him\r\nover the buttocks, where they tooke him and cut off his head.\r\n\r\n        _A most generous courtesie of Sir Francis Drake._ {MN}\r\n\r\nSeaven dayes after Captaine Stafforton sent to me he descryed\r\ntwentie-three Sayle. The next day came to me himselfe (of whom I must say\r\nthis, from the first to the last, he neither spared labour, or perill by\r\nland or sea, fayre weather, or foule, to performe any serious service\r\ncommitted to him.) {MN} He brought me a letter from Sir Francis Drake,\r\nwhose generous mind offered to supply all my defects, of shipping, boats,\r\nmunition, victuall, clothes, and men to further this action: and upon good\r\nconsultation and deliberation, he appointed me a ship of 70. tuns, with an\r\nhundred men, and foure moneths victuals, two Pinnaces, foure small Boats,\r\nwith two sufficient Masters, with sufficient Gangs. All this being made\r\nready for me, suddenly arose such a storme for foure dayes, that had like\r\nto have driven the whole Fleete on shore: many of them were forced to the\r\nSea, whereof my ship so lately given me was one, with all my provision and\r\nCompany appoynted.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, the storme ceasing, the Generall appointed me a ship of\r\n170. tuns, with all provisions as before, to carry me into England the\r\nnext August, or when I had performed such Discoveries as I thought fit.\r\nYet they durst not undertake to bring her into, the harbour, but she must\r\nride in the road, leaving the care of the rest to my selfe, advising me to\r\nconsider with my Company what was fittest, and with my best speed returne\r\nhim answer.\r\n\r\n                  _Virginia abandoned._ {MN}\r\n\r\nHereupon calling my Company together, who were all as privy of the\r\nGenerals offer as my selfe; their whole request was, (in regard of all\r\nthose former miseries, and no hope of the returne of Sir Richard\r\nGrenvill,) and with a generall consent, they desired me to urge him, we\r\nmight all goe with him for England in his Fleete; for whose reliefe in\r\nthat storme he had sustained more perill of wrack, then in all his\r\nhonorable actions against his enemies. {MN} So with prayses to God we set\r\nsayle in June 1586. and arrived in Portsmouth the 27. of July the same\r\nyeare: Leaving this remembrance to posteritie.\r\n\r\n  To reason lend me thine attentive eares, Exempt thy\r\n       selfe from mind-distracting cares:\r\n  Least that's here thus projected for thy good; By thee\r\n       rejected be, ere understood.\r\n\r\n    Written by Mr. Ralph Layne, Governour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          The Observations of Mr. Thomas Heriot in this Voyage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   For Merchandize and Victualls.\r\n\r\n                          _Commodities_\r\n\r\nWhat before is writ, is also confirmed by that learned Mathematician Mr.\r\nThomas Heriot, with them in the Country, whose particular Relation of all\r\nthe Beasts, Birds, Fishes, Foules, Fruites, and Rootes, and how they may\r\nbe usefull; because I have writ it before for the most part in the\r\nDiscourse of Captaine Amidas, and Captaine Layne, except Silk grasse,\r\nWorme silke, Flax like Hempe, Allum, Wapeith, or Terra sigillata, Tar,\r\nRosen, & Turpentine, Civet-cats, Iron ore, Copper that held Silver,\r\nCoprose and Pearle: Let those briefes suffice, because I would not trouble\r\nyou with one thing twice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Dyes._\r\n\r\nFor Dyes, Showmack, the herbe Wasebur, little rootes called Chapacor, and\r\nthe barke of a tree called by the Inhabitants Tangomockonominge, which are\r\nfor divers sorts of Reds.\r\n\r\n                           _A strange Salt._\r\n\r\nWhat more then is related is an herbe in Dutch called Melden, described\r\nlike an Orange, growing foure foote [I.10.] high; the seede will make good\r\nbroth, and the stalke burnt to ashes makes a kinde of Salt: other Salt\r\nthey know not, and we used of it for Pot-herbs. Of their Tobacco we found\r\nplenty, which they esteeme their chiefe Physicke.\r\n\r\n                             _Rootes._\r\n\r\nGround nuts, Tiswaw we call China roots; they grow in clusters, and bring\r\nforth a bryer stalke, but the leafe is far unlike, which will climbe up to\r\nthe top of the highest tree: the use knowne is to cut it in small peeces,\r\nthen stampe & straine it with water, and boyled makes a gelly good to\r\neate. Cassavia growes in Marishes, which the Indians oft use for bread and\r\nbroth. Habascon is like a Parsnip, naught of it selfe, except compounded:\r\nand their Leekes like those in England.\r\n\r\n                        _Fruits thats strange._\r\n\r\nSequenummener, a kinde of Berry like Capers, and three kinde of Berries\r\nlike Acornes, called Sagatamenor, Osamenor, and Pummuckoner.\r\n\r\n                       _Beasts extraordinary._\r\n\r\nSaquenuckot and Maquowoc, two kinde of beasts, greater then Conies, and\r\nvery good meate; in some places such plenty of gray Conies, like hayres,\r\nthat all the people make them mantels of their skins. I have the names\r\nof 28. severall sorts that are dispersed in the Country: of which 12.\r\nkindes we have discovered and good to eate; but the Salvages sometimes\r\nkill a Lyon and eate him.\r\n\r\n                               _Fish._\r\n\r\nThere is plentie of Sturgeon in February, March, Aprill, and May; all\r\nHerings in abundance; some such as ours, but the most part of 18. 20. or\r\n24. ynches long, and more. Trouts, Porpisses, Rayes, Mullets, Old-wives,\r\nPlaice, Tortoises both by Sea and Land: Crabs, Oysters, Mussels, Scalops,\r\nPeriwinckles, Crevises, Secanank: we have the Pictures of 12. sorts more,\r\nbut their names we know not.\r\n\r\n                               _Foules._\r\n\r\nTurkyes, Stockdoves, Partridges, Cranes, Hernes, Swans, Geese, Parrots,\r\nFaulcons, Merlins. I have the names in their language of 86. severall\r\nsorts. Their woods are such as ours in England for the most part, except\r\nRakeock, a great sweet tree, whereof they make their Canowes: and Ascopo,\r\na kinde of tree like Lowrell, and Saxefras.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Their Natures and Manners.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir Clothing, Townes, Houses, Warres, Arts, Tooles, handy crafts, and\r\neducations, are much like them in that part of Virginia we now inhabite:\r\nwhich at large you may reade in the Description thereof. But the relation\r\nof their Religion is strange, as this Author reporteth.\r\n\r\n                         _Their Religion._\r\n                     _How the world was made._ {MN}\r\n\r\nSome Religion they have, which although it be farre from the truth, yet\r\nbeing as it is there is hope it may be the easier reformed. They beleeve\r\nthere are many gods which they call Mantoac, but of different sorts and\r\ndegrees. Also that there is one chiefe God that hath beene from all\r\neternitie, who as they say when he purposed first to make the world, {MN}\r\nmade first other gods of a principall order, to be as instruments to be\r\nused in the Creation and government to follow: And after the Sunne, Moone,\r\nand Starres, as pettie gods; and the instruments of the other order more\r\nprincipall. First (they say) were made waters, out of which by the gods\r\nwere made all diversitie of creatures that are visible or invisible.\r\n\r\n                             _How man was made._\r\n\r\nFor mankinde they say a Woman was made first, which by the working of one\r\nof the gods conceived and brought forth children; and so they had their\r\nbeginning, but how many yeares or ages since they know not; having no\r\nRecords but onely Tradition from Father to sonne.\r\n\r\n                           _How they use their gods._\r\n\r\nThey thinke that all the gods are of humane shape, and therefore represent\r\nthem by Images in the formes of men; which they call Kewasowok: one alone\r\nis called Kewasa; them they place in their Temples, where they worship,\r\npray, sing, and make many offerings. The common sort thinke them also\r\ngods.\r\n\r\n                      _Wheter they goe after death._\r\n\r\nThey beleeve the immortalitie of the Soule, when life departing from the\r\nbody, according to the good or bad workes it hath done, it is carried up\r\nto the Tabernacles of the gods, to perpetuall happinesse, or to Popogusso,\r\na great pit: which they thinke to be at the furthest parts of the world,\r\nwhere the Sunne sets, and there burne continually.\r\n\r\n                 _Two men risen from the dead._ {MN}\r\n\r\nTo confirme this they told me of two men that had beene lately dead, and\r\n[I.11.] revived againe; the one hapned but few yeares before our comming\r\ninto the country; of a bad man, which being dead and buried, the next day\r\nthe earth over him being seene to move, was taken up, who told them his\r\nsoule was very neare entering into Popogusso, had not one of the gods\r\nsaved him and gave him leave to returne againe, to teach his friends what\r\nthey should doe to avoyd such torment. {MN} The other hapned the same\r\nyeare we were there, but sixtie myles from us, which they told me for\r\nnews, that one being dead, buried, & taken up as the first, shewed, that\r\nalthough his body had layne dead in the grave, yet his soule lived, and\r\nhad travailed far in a long broad way, on both sides whereof grew more\r\nsweet, fayre, and delicate trees and fruits, then ever he had seene\r\nbefore; at length he came to most brave and fayre houses, neare which he\r\nmet his Father, that was dead long agoe, who gave him charge to goe backe,\r\nto shew his friends what good there was to doe, to injoy the pleasures of\r\nthat place; which when hee had done hee should come againe.\r\n\r\n                    _The subtiltie of their Priests._\r\n\r\nWhat subtiltie so ever be in the Weroances, and Priests; this opinion\r\nworketh so much in the common sort, that they have great respect to their\r\nGovernours: and as great care to avoyde torment after death, and to enjoy\r\nblisse. Yet they have divers sorts of punishments according to the\r\noffence, according to the greatnesse of the fact. And this is the sum of\r\ntheir Religion, which I learned by having speciall familiaritie with their\r\nPriests, wherein they were not so sure grounded, nor gave such credit, but\r\nthrough conversing with us, they were brought into great doubts of their\r\nowne, and no small admiration of ours: of which many desired to learne\r\nmore then we had meanes for want of utterance in their Language to\r\nexpresse.\r\n\r\n                          _Their simplicitie._\r\n\r\nMost things they saw with us as Mathematicall Instruments, Sea-Compasses;\r\nthe vertue of the Loadstone, Perspective Glasses, burning Glasses: Clocks\r\nto goe of themselves; Bookes, writing, Guns, and such like; so far\r\nexceeded their capacities, that they thought they were rather the workes\r\nof gods then men; or at least the gods had taught us how to make them,\r\nwhich loved us so much better then them; & caused many of them give credit\r\nto what we spake concerning our God. In all places where I came, I did my\r\nbest to make his immortall glory knowne. And I told them, although the\r\nBible I shewed them, contained all; yet of it selfe, it was not of any\r\nsuch vertue as I thought they did conceive. Notwithstanding many would be\r\nglad to touch it, to kisse, and imbrace it, to hold it to their breasts,\r\nand heads, and stroke all their body over with it.\r\n\r\n                       _Their desire of salvation._\r\n\r\nThe King Wingina where we dwelt, would oft be with us at Prayer. Twice he\r\nwas exceeding sicke and like to dye. And doubting of any helpe from his\r\nPriests, thinking he was in such danger for offending us and our God, sent\r\nfor some of us to pray, and be a meanes to our God, he might live with him\r\nafter death. And so did many other in the like case. One other strange\r\nAccident (leaving others) will I mention before I end, which mooved the\r\nwhole Country that either knew or heard of us, to have us in wonderfull\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\n                        _A wonderful Accident._\r\n\r\nThere was no Towne where they had practised any villany against us (we\r\nleaving it unpunished, because we sought by all possible meanes to winne\r\nthem by gentlenes) but within a few dayes after our departure, they began\r\nto dye; in some Townes twenty, in some forty, in some sixty, and in one an\r\nhundred and twenty, which was very many in respect of their numbers. And\r\nthis hapned in no place (we could learn) where we had bin, but where they\r\nhad used some practise to betray us. And this disease was so strange, they\r\nneither knew what it was, nor how to cure it; nor had they knowne the like\r\ntime out of minde; a thing specially observed by us, as also by\r\nthemselves, in so much that some of them who were our friends especially\r\nWingina, had observed such effects in foure or five Townes, that they were\r\nperswaded it was the worke of God through our meanes: and that we by him\r\nmight kill and slay whom we would, without [I.12.] weapons, and not come\r\nneare them. And thereupon, when they had any understanding, that any of\r\ntheir enemies abused us in our Journeyes, they would intreat us, we would\r\nbe a meanes to our God, that they, as the others that had dealt ill with\r\nus, might dye in like sort: although we shewed them their requests were\r\nungodly; and that our God would not subject himselfe to any such requests\r\nof men, but all things as he pleased came to passe: and that we to shew\r\nour selves his true servants, ought rather to pray for the contrary: yet\r\nbecause the effect fell out so suddenly after, according to their desires,\r\nthey thought it came to passe by our meanes, and would come give us\r\nthankes in their manner, that though we satisfied them not in words, yet\r\nin deeds we had fulfilled their desires.\r\n\r\n                      _Their strange opinions._\r\n\r\nThis marveilous Accident in all the Country wrought so strange opinions of\r\nus, that they could not tell whether to thinke us gods or men. And the\r\nrather that all the space of their sicknesse, there was no man of ours\r\nknowne to die, or much sicke. They noted also we had no women, nor cared\r\nfor any of theirs: some therefore thought we were not borne of women, and\r\ntherefore not mortall, but that we were men of an old generation many\r\nyeares past, & risen againe from immortalitie. Some would Prophesie there\r\nwere more of our generation yet to come, to kill theirs and take their\r\nplaces. Those that were to come after us they imagined to be in the ayre,\r\nyet invisible and without bodies: and that they by our intreaties, for\r\nlove of us, did make the people die as they did, by shooting invisible\r\nbullets into them.\r\n\r\nTo confirme this, their Physicians to excuse their Ignorance in curing the\r\ndisease, would make the simple people beleeve, that the strings of bloud\r\nthey sucked out of the sicke bodies, were the strings wherein the\r\ninvisible bullets were tyed, and cast. Some thought we shot them our\r\nselves from the place where we dwelt, and killed the people that had\r\noffended us, as we listed, how farre distant soever. And others said it\r\nwas the speciall worke of God for our sakes, as we had cause in some sort\r\nto thinke no lesse, whatsoever some doe, or may imagine to the contrary;\r\nespecially some Astrologers by the eclipse of the Sunne we saw that yeare\r\nbefore our Voyage, and by a Comet which began to appeare but a few dayes\r\nbefore the sicknesse began: but to exclude them from being the speciall\r\ncauses of so speciall an Accident, there are farther reasons then I thinke\r\nfit to present or alledge.\r\n\r\nThese their opinions I have set downe, that you may see there is hope to\r\nimbrace the truth, and honor, obey, feare and love us, by good dealing and\r\ngovernment: though some of our company towards the latter end, before we\r\ncame away with Sir Francis Drake shewed themselves too furious, in slaying\r\nsome of the people in some Townes, upon causes that on our part might have\r\nbin borne with more mildnesse; notwithstanding they justly had deserved\r\nit. The best neverthelesse in this, as in all actions besides, is to be\r\nindevoured and hoped; and of the worst that may happen, notice to be\r\ntaken with consideration; and as much as may be eschewed; the better to\r\nallure them hereafter to Civilitie and Christianize.\r\n\r\n                              _Palling._\r\n\r\n                     Thus you may see.

Sir Walter Raleigh and his Associates\r\nprepared a ship of a hundred tun, fraughted plentifully of all things\r\nnecessary: but before [I.13.] they set sayle from England it was Easter.\r\nAnd arriving at Hatorask, they after some time spent in seeking the\r\nCollony up in the Country, and not finding them, returned with all the\r\nprovision againe to England.\r\n\r\n               _Sir Richard Grenvill left fiftie men._ {MN}\r\n\r\nAbout 14. or 15. dayes after, Sir Richard Grenvill accompanied with three\r\nships well appoynted, arrived there. Who not finding the aforesaid ship\r\naccording to his expectation, nor hearing any newes of the Collony there\r\nseated, and left by him as is said 1585. travailing up and downe to seeke\r\nthem, but when he could heare no newes of them, and found their habitation\r\nabandoned, unwilling to lose the possession of the Country, {MN} after\r\ngood deliberation he landed fiftie men in the Ile of Roanoak, plentifully\r\nfurnished with all manner of provision for two yeares: and so returned for\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nWhere many began strangely to discant of those crosse beginnings, and him;\r\nwhich caused me remember an old saying of Euripides.\r\n\r\n  Who broacheth ought thats new, to fooles untaught,\r\n  Himselfe shall judged be unwise, and good for naught.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           Three Ships more sent to relieve them by Mr. White.\r\n\r\n                             A.D. 1587.\r\n\r\n                     _Master White his Voyages._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe went the old course by the west Indies, and Simon Ferdinando our\r\ncontinuall Pilot mistaking Virginia for Cape Fear, we sayled not much to\r\nhave beene cast away, upon the conceit of our all-knowing Ferdinando, had\r\nit not beene prevented by the vigilancy of Captaine Stafford. We came to\r\nHatorask the 22. of July, and with fortie of our best men, intending at\r\nRoanoack to find the 50 men left by Sir Richard Grenvill. But we found\r\nnothing but the bones of a man, and where the Plantation had beene, the\r\nhouses unhurt, but overgrowne with weeds, and the Fort defaced, which much\r\nperplexed us.\r\n\r\n                   _One of the Council slaine._ {MN}\r\n\r\nBy the History it seemes Simon Ferdinando did what he could to bring this\r\nvoyage to confusion; but yet they all arrived at Hatorask. They repayred\r\nthe old houses at Roanock, {MN} and Master George How, one of the\r\nCouncell, stragling abroad, was slaine by the Salvages. Not long after\r\nMaster Stafford with 20. men went to Croatan with Manteo, whose friends\r\ndwelled there: of whom we thought to have some newes of our 50 men. They\r\nat first made shew to fight, but when they heard Manteo, they threw away\r\ntheir Armes, and were friends, and desired there might be a token given to\r\nbe knowne by, least we might hurt them by misprision, as the yeare before\r\none had bin by Master Layne, that was ever their friend, and there present\r\nyet lame.\r\n\r\n                    _How the fiftie men were slaine._\r\n\r\nThe next day we had conference with them concerning the people of Secotan,\r\nAquascogoc, and Pomeiok, willing them of Croatan to see if they would\r\naccept friendship, and renew our old acquaintance: which they willingly\r\nimbraced, and promised to bring their King and Governours to Roanoak, to\r\nconfirme it. We also understood that Master Howe was slaine by the men of\r\nWingina, of Dassamonpeack: and by them of Roanoack, {MN} that the fiftie\r\nmen left by Sir Richard Grenvill, were suddainly set upon by three hundred\r\nof Secotan, Aquascogoc, and Dassamonpeack. First they intruded themselves\r\namong 11 of them by friendship, one they slew, the rest retyring to their\r\nhouses, they set them on fire, that our men with what came next to hand\r\nwere forced to make their passage among them; where one of them was shot\r\nin the mouth, and presently dyed, and a Salvage slaine by him. On both\r\nsides more were hurt; but our men retyring to the water side, got their\r\nboat, & ere they had rowed a quarter of a myle towards Hatorask, they\r\ntooke up foure of their fellowes, gathering Crabs and Oysters: at last\r\nthey landed on a little Ile by Hatorask, where they remained a while,\r\nbut after departed they knew not whether. So taking our leaves of the\r\nCroatans, we came to our Fleet at Hatorask.\r\n\r\nThe Governour having long expected the King and Governours of Pomeiok,\r\nSecotan, Aquascogoc, and Dassamonpeack, and the 7. dayes expired, and no\r\nnewes of them, being also informed by those of Croatan, that they of\r\nDassamonpeack slew Master How, and were at the driving our men from\r\nRoanoack he thought no longer to deferre the revenge. Wherefore about\r\nmidnight, with Captaine Stafford, and twentie-foure men, whereof Manteo\r\nwas one, for our guide, (that behaved himselfe towards us as a most\r\nfaithfull English man) he set forward.\r\n\r\n                           _An ill misprision._\r\n\r\n                       _A child borne in Virginia._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThe next day by breake of day we landed, and got beyond their houses,\r\nwhere seeing them sit by the fire we assaulted them. The miserable soules\r\namazed fled into the Reeds, where one was shot through, and we thought to\r\nhave beene fully revenged, but we were deceived, for they were our friends\r\ncome from Croatan to gather their corne, because they understood our\r\nenemies were fled after the death of Master How, and left all behinde them\r\nfor the birds. But they had like to have payd too deare for it, had we not\r\nchanced upon a Weroances wife, with a childe at her backe, and a Salvage\r\nthat knew Captaine Stafford, that ran to him calling him by his name.\r\nBeing thus disappointed of our purpose, we gathered the fruit we found\r\nripe, left the rest unspoyled, and tooke Menatonon his wife with her\r\nchilde, and the rest with us to Roanoak. Though this mistake grieved\r\nManteo, yet he imputed it to their own folly, because they had not kept\r\npromise to come to the governor at the day appointed. The 13. of August\r\nour Salvage Manteo was Christened, and called Lord of Dassamonpeack, in\r\nreward of his faithfulnesse. {MN} And the 18th, Ellinor the Governours\r\ndaughter, and wife to Ananias Dare, was delivered of a daughter in\r\nRoanoak; which being the first Christian there borne, was called\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\n        _A controversie who to send for Factor to England._ {MN}\r\n\r\nOur ships being ready to depart, such a storme arose, as the Admirall was\r\nforced to cut her Cables: and it was six dayes ere she could recover the\r\nshore, that made us doubt she had beene lost, because the most of her best\r\nmen were on shore. {MN} At this time Controversies did grow betwixt our\r\nGovernour and the Assistants, about choosing one of them 12. to goe as\r\nFactor for them all to England; for all refused save one, whom all men\r\nthought most insufficient: the Conclusion was by a generall consent, they\r\nwould have the Governour goe himselfe, for that they thought none would so\r\ntruly procure there supplyes as he. Which though he did what he could to\r\nexcuse it, yet their importunitie would not cease till he under-tooke it,\r\nand had it under all their hands how unwilling he was, but that necessity\r\nand reason did doubly constraine him. At their setting sayle for England,\r\nwaighing Anchor, twelve of the men in the flyboat were throwne from the\r\nCapstern, by the breaking of a barre, and most of them so hurt, that some\r\nnever recovered it. The second time they had the like fortune, being but\r\n15. they cut the Cable and kept company with their Admirall to Flowres and\r\nCorvos; the Admirall stayed there looking for purchase: but the flyboats\r\nmen grew so weake they were driven to Smerwick in the West of Ireland. The\r\nGovernour went for England; and Simon Ferdinando with much adoe at last\r\narrived at Portsmouth. 1587.\r\n\r\nThe Names of those were landed in this Plantation were,\r\n\r\n  John White, Governour.

After we had done\r\nsome exployts in those parts, the third of August wee fell with the low\r\nsandy Iles westward of Wokokon. But by reason of ill weather it was the\r\n11. ere we could Anchor there; and on the 12. we came to Croatan, where is\r\na great breach in 35 degrees and a halfe, in the Northeast poynt of the\r\nIle. The 15. we came to Hatorask in 36. degrees & a terse, at 4. fadom, 3\r\nleagues from shore: where we might perceive a smoake at the place where I\r\nleft the Colony, 1587. The next morning Captaine Cooke, Captaine Spicer,\r\n& their companies, with two boats left our ships, and discharged some\r\nOrdnance to give them notice of our comming, but when we came there, we\r\nfound no man, nor signe of any that had beene there lately: and so\r\nreturned to our Boats. The next morning we prepared againe for Roanoack.\r\nCaptaine Spicer had then sent his Boat ashore for water, so it was ten of\r\nthe Clocke ere we put from the ships, which rode two myles from the shore.\r\nThe Admirals boat, being a myle before the other, as she passed the bar,\r\na sea broke into the boat and filled her halfe full of water: but by Gods\r\ngood will, and the carefull stearage of Captaine Cook, though our\r\nprovisions were much wet we safe escaped, the wind blew hard at Northeast,\r\nwhich caused so great a current and a breach upon the barre; Captaine\r\nSpicer passed halfe over, but by the indiscreet steering of Ralph Skinner,\r\ntheir boat was overset, the men that could catch hold hung about her, the\r\nnext sea cast her on ground, where some let goe their hold to wade to\r\nshore, but the sea beat them downe. {MN-1} The boat thus tossed up and\r\ndowne Captaine Spicer and Skinner hung there till they were drowned; but\r\n4. that could swim a little, kept themselves in deeper water, were saved\r\nby the meanes of Captaine Cook, that presently upon the oversetting of\r\ntheir boat, shipped himselfe to save what he could. Thus of eleven, seven\r\nof the chiefest were drowned. This so discomfited all the Saylers, we had\r\nmuch to do to get them any more to seeke further for the Planters, but by\r\ntheir Captaines forwardnes at last they fitted themselves againe for\r\nHatorask in 2 boats, with 19 persons. It was late ere we arrived, but\r\nseeing a fire through the woods, we sounded a Trumpet, but no answer could\r\nwe heare. The next morning we went to it, but could see nothing but the\r\ngrasse, and some rotten trees burning. We went up and downe the Ile, and\r\nat last found three faire Romane Letters carved. C.R.O. which presently we\r\nknew to signifie the place where I should find them, according to a secret\r\nnote betweene them & me: which was to write the name of the place they\r\nwould be in, upon some tree, dore, or post: and if they had beene in any\r\ndistresse, to signifie it by making a crosse over it. For at my departure\r\nthey intended to goe fiftie myles into the mayne. But we found no signe of\r\ndistresse; then we went to a place where they were left in sundry houses,\r\nbut we found them all taken downe, and the place strongly inclosed with a\r\nhigh Palizado, very Fortlike; and in one of the chiefe Posts carved in\r\nfayre capitall Letters CROATAN, without any signe of distresse, and many\r\nbarres of Iron, two pigs of Lead, foure Fowlers, Iron shot, and such like\r\nheavie things throwne here and there, overgrowne with grasse and weeds. We\r\nwent by the shore to seeke for their boats but could find none, nor any of\r\nthe Ordnance I left them. {MN-2} At last some of the Sailers found divers\r\nChists had beene hidden and digged up againe, and much of the goods\r\nspoyled, and scattered up and downe, which when I saw, I knew three of\r\nthem to be my owne; but bookes, pictures, and all things els were spoyled.\r\nThough it much grieved me, yet it did much comfort me that I did know they\r\nwere at Croatan; so we returned to our Ships, but had like to have bin\r\ncast away by a great storme that continued all that night.\r\n\r\n                 _The end of the Plantation._ {MN}\r\n\r\n[I.16.] The next morning we weighed Anchor for Croatan: having the Anchor\r\na-pike, the Cable broke, by the meanes whereof we lost another: letting\r\nfall the third, the ship yet went so fast a drift, we fayled not much\r\nthere to have split. But God bringing us into deeper water; considering we\r\nhad but one Anchor, and our provision neare spent, we resolved to goe\r\nforthwith to S. Johns Ile, Hispaniola, or Trinidado, to refresh our selves\r\nand seeke for purchase that Winter, and the next Spring come againe to\r\nseeke our Country-men. But our Vice Admirall would not, but went directly\r\nfor England, and we our course for Trinidado. But within two dayes after,\r\nthe wind changing, we were constrained for the Westerne Iles to refresh\r\nour selves, where we met with many of the Queenes ships our owne consort,\r\nand divers others, the 23. of September 1590. And thus we left seeking\r\nthis our Colony, that was never any of them found, nor seene to this day\r\n1622. {MN} And this was the conclusion of this Plantation, after so much\r\ntime, labour, and charge consumed. Whereby we see;\r\n\r\n  Not all at once, nor all alike, nor ever hath it beene,\r\n  That God doth offer and confer his blessings upon men.\r\n\r\n                     Written by Master John White.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CAPTAIN BARTHOLOMEW GOSNOLL\r\n\r\n                            A.D. 1602.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n A briefe Relation of the Description of Elizabeths Ile, and some others\r\n   towards the North part of Virginia; and what els they discovered in the\r\n   yeare 1602. by Captaine Bartholomew Gosnoll, and Captaine Bartholomew\r\n   Gilbert; and divers other Gentlemen their Associates.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      12. _yeares it lay dead._\r\n\r\nAll hopes of Virginia thus abandoned, it lay dead and obscured from 1590.\r\ntill this yeare 1602. that Captaine Gosnoll, with 32. and himselfe in a\r\nsmall Barke, set sayle from Dartmouth upon the 26. of March. Though the\r\nwind favoured us not at the first, but force us as far Southward as the\r\nAsores, which was not much out of our way; we ran directly west from\r\nthence, whereby we made our journey shorter then heretofore by 500.\r\nleagues: the weaknesse of our ship, the badnes of our saylers, and our\r\nignorance of the coast, caused us carry but a low sayle, that made our\r\npassage longer then we expected.\r\n\r\n                     _Their first landing._ {MN}\r\n\r\nOn fryday the 11. of May we made land, it was somewhat low, where appeared\r\ncertaine hummocks or hills in it: the shore white sand, but very rockie,\r\nyet overgrowne with fayre trees. Comming to an Anchor, 8 Indians in a\r\nBaske shallop, with mast and sayle came boldly aboord us. It seemed by\r\ntheir signes & such things as they had, some Biskiners had fished there:\r\nbeing about the latitude of 43. But the harbour being naught, & doubting\r\nthe weather, we went not ashore, but waighed, and stood to the Southward\r\ninto the Sea. {MN} The next morning we found our selves imbayed with a\r\nmightie headland: within a league of the shore we anchored, and Captaine\r\nGosnoll, my selfe, & three others went to it in our boat, being a white\r\nsand & a bold coast. Though the weather was hot, we marched to the highest\r\nhils we could see, where we perceived this headland part of the mayn,\r\nneare invironed with Ilands. As we were returning to our ship, a good\r\nproper, lusty young man came to us, with whom we had but small conference,\r\nand so we left him. Here in 5. or 6. houres we tooke more Cod then we knew\r\nwhat to doe with, which made us perswade our selves, there might be found\r\na good fishing in March, Aprill, and May.\r\n\r\n                 _Martha's Vineyard._  [I.17]\r\n\r\nAt length we came among these fayre Iles, some a league, 2. 3. 5. or 6.\r\nfrom the Mayne, by one of them we anchored. We found it foure myles in\r\ncompasse, without house or inhabitant. In it is a lake neare a myle in\r\ncircuit; the rest overgrowne with trees, which so well as the bushes, were\r\nso overgrowne with Vines, we could scarce passe them. And by the blossomes\r\nwe might perceive there would be plenty of Strawberries, Respises,\r\nGousberries, and divers other fruits: besides, Deere and other Beasts we\r\nsaw, and Cranes, Hernes, with divers other sorts of fowle; which made us\r\ncall it Martha's Vineyard.\r\n\r\n                    _Elizabeths Island._\r\n\r\nThe rest of the Iles are replenished with such like; very rocky, and much\r\ntinctured stone like Minerall. Though we met many Indians, yet we could\r\nnot see their habitations: they gave us fish, Tobacco, and such things as\r\nthey had. But the next Isle we arrived at was but two leagues from the\r\nMaine, & 16. myle about, invironed so with creekes and coves, it seemed\r\nlike many Isles linked together by small passages like bridges. In it is\r\nmany places of plaine grasse, and such other fruits, and berries as before\r\nwere mentioned. In mid-May we did sow Wheat, Barley, Gates, & Pease, which\r\nin 14. dayes sprung up 9. inches. The soyle is fat and lusty: the crust\r\nthereof gray, a foot or lesse in depth. It is full of high timbred Okes,\r\ntheir leaves thrise so broad as ours: Cedar straight and tall, Beech,\r\nHolly, Walnut, Hazell, Cherry trees like ours, but the stalke beareth the\r\nblossom or fruit thereof like a cluster of Grapes, forty or fiftie in a\r\nbunch. There is a tree of Orange colour, whose barke in the filing is as\r\nsmooth as Velvet. There is a lake of fresh water three myles in compasse,\r\nin the midst an Isle containing an acre or thereabout, overgrowne with\r\nwood: here are many Tortoises, and abundance of all sorts of foules, whose\r\nyoung ones we tooke and eate at our pleasure. Grounds nuts as big as\r\negges, as good as Potatoes, and 40. on a string, not two ynches under\r\nground. All sorts of shell-fish, as Schalops, Mussels, Cockles, Crabs,\r\nLobsters, Welks, Oysters, exceeding good and very great; but not to cloy\r\nyou with particulars, what God and nature hath bestowed on those places, I\r\nrefer you to the Authors owne writing at large. We called this Isle\r\nElizabeths Isle, from whence we went right over to the mayne, where we\r\nstood a while as ravished at the beautie and dilicacy of the sweetnesse,\r\nbesides divers cleare lakes, whereof we saw no end, & meadows very large\r\nand full of greene grasse, &c.\r\n\r\n                    _A Copper Mine._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                    _Their return._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nHere we espyed 7. Salvages, at first they expressed some feare, but by our\r\ncourteous usage of them, they followed us to the necke of Land, which we\r\nthought had beene severed from the Mayne, but we found it otherwise. Here\r\nwe imagined was a river, but because the day was farre spent, we left to\r\ndiscover it till better leasure. But of good Harbours, there is no doubt,\r\nconsidering the Land is all rocky and broken lands. The next day we\r\ndetermined to fortifie our selves in the Isle in the lake. Three weekes we\r\nspent in building us there a house. But the second day after our comming\r\nfrom the Mayne, 11. Canows with neare 50. Salvages came towards us. Being\r\nunwilling they should see our building, we went to, & exchanged with them\r\nKnives, Hatchets, Beades, Bels, and such trifles, for some Bevers,\r\nLyzards, Martins, Foxes, wilde Catte skinnes, and such like. {MN-1} We saw\r\nthem have much red Copper, whereof they make chaines, collars, and\r\ndrinking cups, which they so little esteemed they would give us for small\r\ntoyes, & signified unto us they had it out of the earth in the Mayne:\r\nthree dayes they stayed with us, but every night retyred two or three myle\r\nfrom us: after with many signes of love and friendship they departed,\r\nseaven of them staying behind, that did helpe us to dig and carry\r\nSaxafras, and doe any thing they could, being of a comely proportion and\r\nthe best condition of any Salvages we had yet incountred. They have no\r\nBeards but counterfeits, as they did thinke ours also was: for which they\r\nwould have changed with some of our men that had great beards. Some of the\r\nbaser sort would steale; but the better sort, we found very civill and\r\njust. We saw but three of their women, and they were but of meane stature,\r\n[I.18.] attyred in skins like the men, but fat and well favoured. The\r\nwholesomenesse and temperature of this climate, doth not onely argue the\r\npeople to be answerable to this Description, but also of a perfect\r\nconstitution of body, active, strong, healthfull, and very witty, as the\r\nsundry toyes by them so cunningly wrought may well testifie. For our\r\nselves, we found our selves rather increase in health and strength then\r\notherwise; for all our toyle, bad dyet and lodging; yet not one of us was\r\ntouched with any sicknesse. {MN-2} Twelve intended here a while to have\r\nstayed, but upon better consideration, how meanely we were provided, we\r\nleft this Island (with as many true sorrowfull eyes as were before\r\ndesirous to see it) the 18. of June, and arrived at Exmouth, the 23 of\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\n        But yet mans minde doth such it selfe explay,\r\n        As Gods great Will doth frame it every way.\r\n    And, Such thoughts men have, on earth that doe but live,\r\n        As men may crave, but God doth onely give.\r\n\r\n          Written by John Brierton one of the Voyage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      CAPTAIN MARTIN PRING\r\n\r\n                          A.D. 1603.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n A Voyage of Captaine Martin Pring, with two Barks from Bristow, for the\r\n   North part of Virginia. 1603.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the inducements and perswasions of Mr. Richard Hackluite, Mr. John\r\nWhitson being Maior, with his brethren the Aldermen, & most of the\r\nMerchants of the Citie of Bristow, raised a stocke of 1000 L. to furnish\r\nout two Barkes, the one of 50. tuns, with 30. men and boyes, the other 26.\r\ntuns, with 13. men and boyes, having Martin Pring an understanding\r\nGentleman, and a sufficient Mariner for Captaine, and Robert Salterne his\r\nAssistant, who had bin with Captaine Gosnoll there the yeare before for\r\nPilot. Though they were much crossed by contrary windes upon the coast of\r\nEngland, and the death of that ever most memorable, miracle of the world,\r\nour most deare soveraigne Lady and Queene Elizabeth: yet at last they\r\npassed by the westerne Isles, and about the 7. of June, fell upon the\r\nnorth part of Virginia, about the degrees of fortie three. Where they\r\nfound plentie of most sorts of fish, and saw a high country full of great\r\nwoods of sundry sorts. As they ranged the coast at a place they named\r\nWhitson Bay, they were kindly used by the Natives, that came to them, in\r\ntroupes, of tens, twenties, & thirties, and sometimes more. But because in\r\nthis Voyage for most part they followed the course of Captaine Gosnoll,\r\nand have made no relation but to the same effect he writ before, we will\r\nthus conclude;\r\n\r\n        Lay hands unto this worke with all thy wit,\r\n        But pray that God would speed and perfit it.\r\n\r\n                           Robert Salterne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            A.D. 1605.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n A relation of a Discovery towards the Northward of Virginia, by Captaine\r\n   George Waymouth 1605. imployed thether by the right Honorable Thomas\r\n   Arundell, Baron of Warder, in the Raigne of our most royall King James.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Dangerous shoules._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                      _Cod and Whales._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\n                     _Their first landing._ {MN-3}\r\n\r\nUpon tuesday the fift of March we set sayle from Ratcliffe, but by\r\ncontrary winds we were forced into Dartmouth till the last of this moneth,\r\nthen with 29. as good sea men, & all necessary provisions as could\r\n[I.19.] possibly be gotten, we put to sea; and the 24 of Aprill fell with\r\nFlowres and Corvos. We intended as we were directed towards the Southward\r\nof 39. {MN-1} But the winds so crossed us wee fell more Northwards about\r\n41. and 20. minuits, we sounded at 100. fathom, & by that we had run 6\r\nleagues we had but 5. yet saw no land; from the mayne top we descryed a\r\nwhitish sandy clift, West North-west some 6. leagues from us, but ere we\r\nhad run two leagues further we found many shoules and breaches, sometimes\r\nin 4. fadom and the next throw 15. or 18. Being thus imbayed among those\r\nshoules, we were constrained to put back againe, which we did with no\r\nsmall danger, though both the winde and weather were as fayre as we could\r\ndesire. Thus we parted from the Land, which we had not before so much\r\ndesired, and at the first sight rejoyced, as now we all joyfully praysed\r\nGod that he had delivered us from so eminent danger. {MN-2} Here we found\r\nexcellent Cod, and saw many Whales as we had done 2. or 3. daies before.\r\nBeing thus constrained to put to sea, the want of wood & water caused us\r\ntake the best advantage of the winde, to fall with the shore wheresoever:\r\nbut we found our Sea-cards most directly false. The 17. of May we made the\r\nLand againe, but it blew so hard, we durst not approach it. The next day\r\nit appeared to us a mayne high land, but we found it an Island of 6. myles\r\nin compasse: {MN-3} within a league of it we came to an anchor, and went on\r\nshore for wood & water, of which we found sufficient. The water gushing\r\nforth downe the rocky clifts, in many places, which are all overgrown with\r\nFirre, Birch, Beech, & Oke, as the Verge is with Gousberries, Strawberries,\r\nwild Pease, and Rose bushes, and much foule of divers sorts that breed\r\namong the rockes: here as in all places els where we came, we found Cod\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n                     _Pentecost harbour._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                   _The Captains diligence._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nFrom hence we might discerne the mayne land and very high mountaines, the\r\nnext day because we rode too open to the Sea, we waighed, and came to the\r\nIsles adjoyning to the mayn: among which we found an excellent rode,\r\ndefended from all windes, for ships of any burthen, in 6. 7. 8. 9. or 10.\r\nfadom upon a clay oze. {MN-1} This was upon a Whitsonday, wherefore we\r\ncalled it Pentecost Harbour. Here I cannot omit for foolish feare of\r\nimputation of flattery, the painfull industry of our Captaine, who as at\r\nSea he was alwayes most carefull & vigilant, so at land he refused no\r\npaines: {MN-2} but his labour was ever as much or rather more then any\r\nmans; which not onely incouraged others with better content, but also\r\neffected much with great expedition. We digged a Garden the 22. of May,\r\nwhere among our garden-seeds we sowed Pease and Barley, which in 16. dayes\r\ngrew up 8. ynches, although this was but the crust of the ground, and much\r\ninferiour to the mould we after found in the mayne.\r\n\r\n                    _Trade with the Salvages._ {MN}\r\n\r\nAfter we had taken order for all our necessary businesses, we marched\r\nthrough two of these Isles. The biggest was 4. or 5. myles in compasse; we\r\nfound here all sorts of ordinary trees, besides, Vines, Currants, Spruce,\r\nYew, Angelica, and divers gummes: in so much many of our company wished\r\nthemselves setled here. Upon the 30. our Captaine with 13. went to\r\ndiscover the mayne: we in the ship espyed 3. Canowes that came towards the\r\nship. Which after they had well viewed, one of them came aboord with 3.\r\nmen, and by our good usage of them not long after the rest, two dayes we\r\nhad their companies, in all respects they are but like them at Elizabeths\r\nIsles, therefore this may suffice for their description. In this time our\r\nCaptain had discovered a fayre river, trending into the mayne 40 myles,\r\nand returned backe to bring in the ship. {MN} The Salvages also kept their\r\nwords and brought us 40. Bever, Otter, and sable skins, for the value of\r\n5. shillings in knives, glasses, combes, and such toyes, and thus we used\r\nthem so kindly as we could, because we intended to inhabit in their\r\nCountry, they lying aboord with us and we ashore with them; but it was but\r\nas changing man for man as hostages, and in this manner many times we had\r\ntheir companies.\r\n\r\n                    _Their trechery._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n               _Five Salvages surprised._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nAt last they desired our Captaine to goe with them to the mayne to trade\r\nwith their Bashabes, which is their chiefe Lord, which we did, our boat\r\nwell manned with [I.20.] 14. yet would they row faster with 3. Ores in\r\ntheir Canowes then we with 8. but when we saw our old acquaintance, would\r\nnot stay aboord us as before for hostage, but did what they could to draw\r\nus into a narrow cirke, {MN-1} we exchanged one Owen Griffin with them for\r\na yong fellow of theirs, that he might see if he could discover any\r\ntrechery, as he did, for he found there assembled 283. Salvages with bowes\r\n& arrows, but not any thing at all to trade as they pretended. These things\r\nconsidered, we conceited them to be but as all Salvages ever had beene,\r\nkinde till they found opportunitie to do mischiefe. {MN-2} Wherefore we\r\ndetermined to take some of them, before they should suspect we had\r\ndiscovered their plot, lest they should absent themselves from us, so the\r\nfirst that ever after came into the ship were three which we kept, and two\r\nwe tooke on shore with much adoe, with two Canowes, their bowes and\r\narrowes.\r\n\r\n                   _A description of the river._ {MN}\r\n\r\nSome time we spent in sounding all the Isles, channels, and inlets\r\nthereabouts, and we found 4. severall waies a ship might be brought into\r\nthis Bay. In the interim there came 2. Canowes more boldly aboord us,\r\nsignifying we should bring our ship to the place where he dwelt to trade.\r\nWe excused our selves why we could not, but used them kindly, yet got them\r\naway with all the speed we could, that they should not be perceived by\r\nthem in the houle, then we went up the river 26. myles, of which I had\r\nrather not write, then by my relation detract from it, {MN} it is in\r\nbreadth a myle, neare 40. myles; and a channell of 6. 7. 8. 9. or 10.\r\nfadom, & on both sides every halfe myle gallant Coves, to containe in many\r\nof them 100 sayle, where they may lye on Oze without Cable or Anchor,\r\nonely mored with a Hauser, and it floweth 18. foot, that you may make,\r\ndocke, or carine ships with much facilitie: besides the land is most rich,\r\ntrending all along on both sides in an equall plaine, neither rocky nor\r\nmountainous, but verged with a greene border of grasse, doth make tender\r\nto the beholder her pleasant fertilitie, if by cleansing away the woods\r\nshe were converted into meadow.\r\n\r\nThe woods are great, and tall, such as are spoken of in the Islands, and\r\nwell watered with many fresh springs. Our men that had seene Oranoque so\r\nfamous in the worlds eares, Reogrande, Loyer, & Slion, report, though\r\nthey be great & goodly rivers, yet are not comparable to it. Leaving our\r\nship we went higher, till we were 7. myles higher then the salt water\r\nflowed; we marched towards the mountains we had seene, but the weather was\r\nso hot, & our labour so great, as our Captaine was contented to returne:\r\nafter we had erected a crosse we left this faire land and river, in which\r\nthe higher we went the better we liked it, and returned to our ship. By\r\nthe way we met a Canow that much desired one of our men to go up to their\r\nBasshabes, but we knew their intents, and so turned them off; and though\r\nwe had both time and provision to have discovered much more, and might\r\nhave found peradventure good trade, yet because our company was but small,\r\nwe would not hazzard so hopefull a businesse as this was, either for our\r\nprivate, or particular ends, being more regardfull of a publicke good, and\r\npromulgating Gods holy Church by planting Christianity, which was the\r\nintent of our adventurers so well as ours; returning by the Isles in the\r\nentry of the Sound we called them St. Georges Isles, & because on Sunday\r\nwe set out of England, on Sunday also the 16. of June we departed hence.\r\nWhen we had run 30. leagues we had 40. fadom, then 70. then 100. After 2.\r\nor 3. watches more we were in 24. fadoms, where we tooke so much Cod as we\r\ndid know what to doe with, and the 18. of July came to Dartmouth, and all\r\nour men as well God be thanked as when they went forth.\r\n\r\n                         Thus may you see;\r\n    God hath not all his gifts bestowed on all or any one,\r\n    Words sweetest, and wits sharpest, courage, strength of bone;\r\n    All rarities of minde and parts doe all concurre in none.\r\n\r\n              Written by James Rosier one of the Voyage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE SECOND BOOKE. [II.21.]\r\n\r\n                        The Sixt Voyage. 1606.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n To another part of Virginia, where now are Planted our English Colonies,\r\n    Whom God increase and preserve: Discovered and Described by Captaine\r\n    John Smith, sometimes Governour of the Countrey.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              A.D. 1606.\r\n\r\n                          _The latitude._ {MN}\r\n\r\nBy these former relations you may see what inconveniences still crossed\r\nthose good intents, and how great a matter it was all this time to finde\r\nbut a Harbour, although there be so many. But this Virginia is a Country\r\nin America {MN} betweene the degrees of 34. and 45. of the North latitude.\r\nThe bounds thereof on the East side are the great Ocean: on the South\r\nlyeth Florida: on the North nova Francia: as for the West thereof, the\r\nlimits are unknowne. Of all this Country we purpose not to speake, but\r\nonely of that part which was planted by the English men in the yeare of\r\nour Lord, 1606. And this is under the degrees 37. 38. and 39. The\r\ntemperature of this Country doth agree well with English constitutions,\r\nbeing once seasoned to the Country. Which appeared by this, that though by\r\nmany occasions our people fell sicke; yet did they recover by very small\r\nmeanes, and continued in health, though there were other great causes, not\r\nonely to have made them sicke, but even to end their dayes, &c.\r\n\r\n                        _The temperature._\r\n\r\nThe Sommer is hot as in Spaine; the Winter cold as in France or England.\r\nThe heat of sommer is in June, July, and August, but commonly the coole\r\nBreeses asswage the vehemency of the heat. The chiefe of winter is halfe\r\nDecember, January, February, and halfe March. The colde is extreame\r\nsharpe, but here the Proverbe is true, that no extreame long continueth.\r\n\r\nIn the yeare 1607. was an extraordinary frost in most of Europe, and this\r\nfrost was found as extreame in Virginia. But the next yeare for 8. or 10.\r\ndayes of ill weather, other 14. dayes would be as Sommer.\r\n\r\n                          _The windes._\r\n\r\nThe windes here are variable, but the like thunder and lightning to\r\npurifie the ayre, I have seldome either seene or heard in Europe. From the\r\nSouthwest came the greatest gusts with thunder and heat. The North-west\r\nwinde is commonly coole and bringeth faire weather with it. From the North\r\nis the greatest cold, and from the East and Southeast as from the\r\nBarmudas, fogs and raines.\r\n\r\nSome times there are great droughts, other times much raine, yet great\r\nnecessitie of neither, by reason we see not but that all the raritie of\r\nneedfull fruits in Europe, may be there in great plentie, by the industry\r\nof men, as appeareth by those we there Planted.\r\n\r\n                         _The entrances._\r\n\r\n                         _Cape Henry._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThere is but one entrance by Sea into this Country, and that is at the\r\nmouth of a very goodly Bay, 18. or 20. myles broad. {MN} The cape on the\r\nSouth is called Cape Henry, in honour of our most noble Prince. The land\r\nwhite hilly sands like unto the Downes, and all along the shores great\r\nplentie of Pines and Firres.\r\n\r\n                            _Cape Charles._\r\n\r\n                         _The Countrey._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThe north Cape is called Cape Charles, in honour of the worthy Duke of\r\nYorke. The Isles before it, Smith's Isles, by the name of the discoverer.\r\nWithin is a country that may have the prerogative over the most pleasant\r\nplaces knowne, for large and pleasant navigable Rivers, heaven & earth\r\nnever agreed better to frame a place for man's habitation; were it fully\r\nmanured and inhabited by industrious people. {MN} Here are mountaines,\r\nhils, plaines, valleyes, rivers, and brookes, all running most pleasantly\r\ninto a faire Bay, compassed but for the mouth, with fruitfull and\r\ndelightsome land. In the Bay and rivers are many Isles both great & small,\r\nsome woody, some plaine, most of them low and not inhabited. This Bay\r\nlyeth North and South, in which the water floweth neare 200. myles, and\r\nhath a channell for 140 myles, of depth betwixt 6 and 15 fadome, holding\r\nin breadth for the most part 10 or 14 myles. From the head of the Bay\r\nto the Northwest, the land is mountanous, and so in a manner from thence\r\nby a Southwest line; so that the more Southward, the farther off from the\r\nBay are those mountaines. From which fall certaine brookes which after\r\ncome to five principall navigable rivers. These run from the Northwest\r\ninto the South east, and so into the West side of the Bay, where the fall\r\nof every River is within 20 or 15 myles one of another.\r\n\r\n                           _The mountaines._\r\n\r\n                           _The soyle._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThe mountaines are of divers natures: for at the head of the Bay the\r\nrockes are of a composition like Mill stones. Some of Marble, &c. And many\r\npeeces like Christall we found, as throwne downe by water from those\r\nmountaines. For in Winter they are covered with much snow, and when it\r\ndissolveth the waters fall with such violence, that it causeth great\r\ninundations in some narrow valleyes, which is scarce perceived being once\r\nin the rivers. These waters wash from the rocks such glistering tinctures,\r\nthat the ground in some places seemeth as guilded, where both the rocks\r\nand the earth are so splendent to behold, that better judgements then ours\r\nmight have beene perswaded, they contained more then probabilities. The\r\nvesture of the earth in most places doth manifestly prove the nature of\r\nthe soyle to be lusty and very rich. {MN} The colour of the earth we found\r\nin diverse places, resembleth bole Armoniac, terra sigillata, and Lemnia,\r\nFullers earth, Marie, and divers other such appearances. But generally for\r\nthe most part it is a blacke sandy mould, in some places a fat slimy clay,\r\nin other places a very barren gravell. But the best ground is knowne by\r\nthe vesture it beareth, as by the greatnesse of trees, or abundance of\r\nweeds, &c.\r\n\r\n                           _The valleyes._\r\n\r\n                           _Plaines._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThe Country is not mountanous, nor yet low, but such pleasant plaine hils,\r\nand fertile valleyes, one prettily crossing another, & watered so\r\nconveniently with fresh brookes and springs, no lesse commodious, then\r\ndelightsome. {MN} By the rivers are many plaine marishes, containing some\r\n20 some 100. some 200 Acres, some more, some lesse. Other plaines there\r\nare few, but onely where the Salvages inhabit: but all overgrowne with\r\ntrees & weeds, being a plaine wildernesse as God first made it.\r\n\r\n                  _The river Powhatan._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                     _The branches._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\n                      _James Towne._ {MN-3}\r\n\r\nOn the west side of the Bay, we sayd were 5. faire and delightfull\r\nnavigable rivers. The first of those, and the next to the mouth of the Bay\r\nhath his course from the West Northwest. {MN-1} It is called Powhatan,\r\naccording to the name of a principall country that lyeth upon it. The\r\nmouth of this river is neare three myles in breadth, yet doe the shoules\r\nforce the Channell so neare the land, that a Sacre will overshoot it at\r\npoint blanke. It is navigable 150 myles, the shouldes and soundings are\r\nhere needlesse to be expressed. It falleth from Rockes farre west in a\r\nCountry inhabited by a nation they call Monacans. But where it commeth\r\ninto our discovery it is Powhatan. In the farthest place that was\r\ndiligently observed, are falles, rockes, shoules, &c. which makes it past\r\nnavigation any higher. Thence in the running downeward, the river is\r\nenriched with many goodly brookes, which are maintained by an infinit\r\nnumber of small rundles and pleasant springs, that disperse themselves for\r\nbest service, as do the veines of a mans body. {MN-2} From the South there\r\nfals into it: First, the pleasant river of Apamatuck. Next more to the\r\nEast are two small rivers of Quiyoughcohanocke. A little farther is a Bay\r\nwherein falleth 3 or 4 prettie brookes & creekes that halfe intrench the\r\nInhabitants of Warraskoyac, then the river of Nandsamund, and lastly the\r\nbrooke of Chisapeack. From the North side is the river of Chickahamania,\r\nthe backe river of James Towne; another by the Cedar Isle, where we lived\r\nten weekes upon Oysters, then a convenient harbour for Fisher boats at\r\nKecoughtan, that so turneth it selfe into Bayes and Creekes, it makes that\r\n[II.23] place very pleasant to inhabit; their cornefields being girded\r\ntherein in a manner as Peninsulaes. The most of these rivers are inhabited\r\nby severall nations, or rather families, of the name of the rivers. They\r\nhave also over those some Governour, as their King, which they call\r\nWerowances. {MN-3} In a Peninsula on the North side of this river are the\r\nEnglish Planted in a place by them called James Towne, in honour of the\r\nKings most excellent Majestie.\r\n\r\n                     _The severall Inhabitants._\r\n\r\nThe first and next the rivers mouth are the Kecoughtans, who besides their\r\nwomen & children, have not past 20. fighting men. The Paspaheghes (on\r\nwhose land is seated James Towne, some 40 myles from the Bay) have not\r\npast 40. The river called Chickahamania neare 250. The Weanocks 100. The\r\nArrowhatocks 30. The place called Powhatan, some 40. On the South side\r\nthis river the Appamatucks have sixtie fighting men. The Quiyougcohanocks\r\n25. The Nandsamunds 200. The Chesapeacks 100. Of this last place the Bay\r\nbeareth the name. In all these places is a severall commander, which they\r\ncall Werowance, except the Chickahamanians, who are governed by the\r\nPriests and their Assistants, or their Elders called Caw-cawwassoughes. In\r\nsommer no place affordeth more plentie of Sturgeon, nor in winter more\r\nabundance of foule, especially in the time of frost. I tooke once 52.\r\nSturgeons at a draught, at another 68. From the later end of May till the\r\nend of June are taken few, but yong Sturgeons of two foot, or a yard long.\r\nFrom thence till the midst of September, them of two or three yards long\r\nand few others. And in 4 or 5, houres with one Net were ordinarily taken\r\n7 or 8: often more, seldome lesse. In the small rivers all the yeare there\r\nis good plentie of small fish, so that with hookes those that would take\r\npaines had sufficient.\r\n\r\n                            _R. Pamaunkee._\r\n\r\n                         _The inhabitants._ {MN}\r\n\r\nFoureteene myles Northward from the river Powhatan, is the river\r\nPamaunkee, which is navigable 60 or 70 myles, but with Catches and small\r\nBarkes 30 or 40 myles farther. At the ordinary flowing of the salt water,\r\nit divideth it selfe into two gallant branches. {MN} On the South side\r\ninhabit the people of Youghtanund, who have about 60 men for warres. On\r\nthe North branch Mattapament, who have 30 men. Where this river is divided\r\nthe Country is called Pamaunkee, and nourisheth neare 300 able men. About\r\n25. myles lower on the North side of this river is Werawocomoco, where\r\ntheir great King inhabited when I was delivered him prisoner; yet there\r\nare not past 40 able men. Ten or twelve myles lower, on the South side of\r\nthis river, is Chiskiack, which hath some 40 or 50 men. These, as also\r\nApamatuck, Irrohatock, and Powhatan, are their great Kings chiefe\r\nalliance, and inhabitants. The rest his Conquests.\r\n\r\n                          _Payankatank, R._\r\n\r\nBefore we come to the third river that falleth from the mountaines, there\r\nis another river (some 30 myles navigable) that commeth from the Inland,\r\ncalled Payankatanke, the Inhabitants are about 50 or 60 serviceable men.\r\n\r\n                          _Topahanock, R._\r\n\r\n                         _The Inhabitants._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThe third navigable river is called Toppahanock. (This is navigable some\r\n130 myles) {MN} At the top of it inhabit the people called Mannahoacks\r\namongst the mountaines, but they are above the place we described. Upon\r\nthis river on the North side are the people Cuttatawomen, with 30 fighting\r\nmen. Higher are the Moraughtacunds, with 80. Beyond them Rapahanock with\r\n100. Far above is another Cuttatawomen with 20. On the South is the\r\npleasant seat of Nantaughtacund having 150 men. The river also as the two\r\nformer, is replenished with fish and foule.\r\n\r\n                          _Patawomeck, R._\r\n\r\n                      _The Inhabitants._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThe fourth river is called Patawomeke, 6 or 7 myles in breadth. It is\r\nnavigable 140 myles, and fed as the rest with many sweet rivers and\r\nsprings, which fall from the bordering hils. These hils many of them are\r\nplanted, and yeeld no lesse plentie and varietie of fruit, then the river\r\nexceedeth with abundance of fish. {MN} It is inhabited on both sides.\r\nFirst on the South side at the very entrance is Wighcocomoco & hath some\r\n130 men, beyond them Sekacawone with 30. The Onawmanient with 100. And the\r\nPatawomekes more then 200. Here doth the river divide it selfe into 3 or 4\r\nconvenient branches. The greatest of the least is called Quiyough,\r\ntrending North-west, but the river it selfe turneth Northeast, and is\r\nstill a navigable streame. On the Westerne side of this bought is\r\nTauxenent with 40 men. On the North of this river is Secowocomoco with 40.\r\nSomewhat further Potapaco with 20. In the East part is Pamacaeack with 60.\r\n[II.24.] After Moyowance with 100. And lastly, Nacotchtanke with 80. The\r\nriver above this place maketh his passage downe a low pleasant valley\r\novershaddowed in many places with high rocky mountaines; from whence\r\ndistill innumerable sweet and pleasant springs.\r\n\r\n                           _Pawtuxunt, R._\r\n\r\nThe fift river is called Pawtuxunt, of a lesse proportion then the rest;\r\nbut the channell is 16 fadome deepe in some places. Here are infinit skuls\r\nof divers kindes of fish more then elswhere. Upon this river dwell the\r\npeople called Acquintanacksuak, Pawtuxunt, and Mattapanient. Two hundred\r\nmen was the greatest strength that could be there perceived. But they\r\ninhabit together, and not so dispersed as the rest. These of all other we\r\nfound most civill to give intertainement.\r\n\r\n                  _Bolus, R. The head of the Bay._\r\n\r\n                         _Sasquesahanock._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThirtie leagues Northward is a river not inhabited, yet navigable; for the\r\nred clay resembling bole Armoniack we called it Bolus. At the end of the\r\nBay where it is 6 or 7 myles in breadth, it divides it selfe into 4.\r\nbranches, the best commeth Northwest from among the mountaines, but though\r\nCanows may goe a dayes journey or two up it, we could not get two myles up\r\nit with our boat for rockes. {MN} Upon it is seated the Sasquesahanocks,\r\nneare it North and by West runneth a creeke a myle and a halfe: at the\r\nhead whereof the Ebbe left us on shore, where we found many trees cut with\r\nhatchets. The next tyde keeping the shore to seeke for some Salvages; (for\r\nwithin thirtie leagues sayling, we saw not any, being a barren Country,)\r\nwe went up another small river like a creeke 6 or 7 myle. From thence\r\nreturning we met 7 Canowes of the Massowomeks, with whom we had conference\r\nby signes, for we understood one another scarce a word: the next day we\r\ndiscovered the small river & people of Tockwhogh trending Eastward.\r\n\r\n              _The description of Sasquesahanough._ {MN}\r\n\r\nHaving lost our Grapnell among the rocks of Sasquesahanocks, we were then\r\nneare 200 myles from home, and our Barge about two tuns, and had in it but\r\n12 men to performe this Discovery, wherein we lay above 12 weekes upon\r\nthose great waters in those unknowne Countries, having nothing but a\r\nlittle meale, oatemeale and water to feed us, and scarce halfe sufficient\r\nof that for halfe that time, but what provision we got among the Salvages,\r\nand such rootes and fish as we caught by accident, and Gods direction; nor\r\nhad we a Mariner nor any had skill to trim the sayles but two saylers and\r\nmy selfe, the rest being Gentlemen, or them were as ignorant in such toyle\r\nand labour. Yet necessitie in a short time by good words and examples made\r\nthem doe that that caused them ever after to feare no colours. What I did\r\nwith this small meanes I leave to the Reader to judge, and the Mappe I\r\nmade of the Country, which is but a small matter in regard of the\r\nmagnitude thereof. But to proceed, 60 of those Sasquesahanocks came to us\r\nwith skins, Bowes, Arrows, Targets, Beads, Swords, and Tobacco pipes for\r\npresents. {MN} Such great and well proportioned men are seldome seene, for\r\nthey seemed like Giants to the English, yea and to the neighbours, yet\r\nseemed of an honest and simple disposition, with much adoe restrained from\r\nadoring us as Gods. Those are the strangest people of all those Countries,\r\nboth in language & attire; for their language it may well beseeme their\r\nproportions, sounding from them, as a voyce in a vault. Their attire is the\r\nskinnes of Beares, and Woolves, some have Cassacks made of Beares heads &\r\nskinnes, that a mans head goes through the skinnes neck, and the eares\r\nof the Beare fastned to his shoulders, the nose and teeth hanging downe\r\nhis breast, another Beares face split behind him, and at the end of the\r\nnose hung a Pawe, the halfe sleeves comming to the elbowes were the neckes\r\nof Beares, and the armes through the mouth with pawes hanging at their\r\nnoses. One had the head of a Woolfe hanging in a chaine for a Jewell, his\r\nTobacco pipe three quarters of a yard long, prettily carved with a Bird, a\r\nDeere, or some such devise at the great end, sufficient to beat out ones\r\nbraines: with Bowes, Arrowes, and clubs, sutable to their greatnesse.\r\nThese are scarse knowne to Powhatan. They can make neare 600 able men, and\r\nare pallisadoed in their Townes to defend them from the Massawomekes their\r\nmortall enemies. Five of their chiefe Werowances came aboord us, and\r\ncrossed the Bay in their Barge. The picture of the greatest of them is\r\nsignified in the Mappe. The calfe of whose leg was three quarters of a\r\nyard about, and [II.5] all the rest of his limbes so answerable to that\r\nproportion, that he seemed the goodliest man we ever beheld. His hayre, the\r\none side was long, the other shore close with a ridge over his crowne like\r\na cocks combe. His arrowes were five quarters long, headed with the\r\nsplinters of a white christall-like stone, in forme of a heart, an inch\r\nbroad, and an inch and a halfe or more long. These he wore in a Woolves\r\nskinne at his backe for his Quiver, his bow in the one hand and his clubbe\r\nin the other, as is described.\r\n\r\n                           _Tockwogh, R._\r\n\r\n                      _Rapahanock, R._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                     _Kuskarawaock, R._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\n                     _Wighcocomoco, R._ {MN-3}\r\n\r\n                        _Accomack, R._ {MN-4}\r\n\r\nOn the East side the Bay, is the river Tockwhogh, and upon it a people\r\nthat can make 100 men, seated some seaven myles within the river: where\r\nthey have a Fort very well pallisadoed and mantelled with barkes of trees.\r\nNext them is Ozinies with sixty men. {MN-1} More to the South of that East\r\nside of the Bay, the river Rapahanock, neere unto which is the {MN-2}\r\nriver Kuskarawaock, Upon which is seated a people with 200 men. After\r\nthat, is the river {MN-3} Tants Wighcocomoco, & on it a people with 100\r\nmen. The people of those rivers are of little stature, of another language\r\nfrom the rest, & very rude. But they on the {MN-4} river Acohanock with 40\r\nmen, & they of Accomack 80 men doth equalize any of the Territories of\r\nPowhatan, and speake his language, who over all those doth rule as King.\r\n\r\n                               _Chawonock._\r\n\r\n                     _The severall languages._ {MN}\r\n\r\nSouthward we went to some parts of Chawonock and the Mangoags to search\r\nfor them left by Mr. White. {MN} Amongst those people are thus many\r\nseverall Nations of sundry Languages, that environ Powhatans Territories.\r\nThe Chawonockes, the Mangoags, the Monacans, the Mannahokes, the\r\nMasawomekes, the Powhatans, the Sasquesahanocks, the Atquanachukes, the\r\nTockwoghes, and the Kuscarawaokes. All those not any one understandeth\r\nanother but by Interpreters. Their severall habitations are more plainly\r\ndescribed by this annexed Mappe, which will present to the eye, the way of\r\nthe mountaines, and current of the rivers, with their severall turnings,\r\nbayes, shoules, Isles, Inlets, and creekes, the breadth of the waters, the\r\ndistances of places, and such like. In which Mappe observe this, that as\r\nfar as you see the little Crosses on rivers, mountaines, or other places\r\nhave beene discovered; the rest was had by information of the Savages, and\r\nare set downe according to their instructions.\r\n\r\n    Thus have I walkt a wayless way, with uncouth pace,\r\n    Which yet no Christian man did ever trace:\r\n    But yet I know this not affects the minde,\r\n    Which eares doth heare, as that which eyes doe finde.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          Of such things which are naturally in Virginia,\r\n                        and how they use them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Why there is little grasse._\r\n\r\n                _Woods with their fruits._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                           _Elme._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\n                         _Walnuts._ {MN-3}\r\n\r\n                     _Supposed Cypres._ {MN-4}\r\n\r\n                         _Mulberries._ {MN-5}\r\n\r\nVirginia doth afford many excellent vegetables, and living Creatures, yet\r\ngrasse there is little or none, but what groweth in low Marishes: for all\r\nthe Countrey is overgrowne with trees, whose droppings continually turneth\r\ntheir grasse to weeds, by reason of the rancknes of the ground, which\r\nwould soone be amended by good husbandry. {MN-1} The wood that is most\r\ncommon is Oke and Walnut, many of their Okes are so tall & straight, that\r\nthey will beare two foote and a halfe square of good timber for 20 yards\r\nlong; Of this wood there is two or three severall kinds. The Acornes of\r\none kinde, whose barke is more white then the other, & somewhat sweetish,\r\nwhich being boyled, at last affords a sweet oyle, that they keepe in\r\ngourds to annoint their heads and joynts. The fruit they eate made in\r\nbread or otherwise. {MN-2} There is also some Elme, some blacke Walnut\r\ntree, and some Ash: of Ash and Elme they make sope Ashes. If the trees\r\nbe very great, the Ashes will be good, and melt to hard lumps, but if they\r\nbe small, it will be but powder, and not so good as the other. {MN-3} Of\r\nwalnuts there is 2 or 3 kindes; there is {MN-4} a kinde of wood we called\r\nCypres, because both the wood, the fruit, and leafe did most resemble it,\r\nof those trees there are some neare three fadome about at the foot, very\r\nstraight, and 50, 60, or 80 foot without [II.26.] a branch. {MN-5} By the\r\ndwelling of the Salvages are some great Mulberry trees, and in some parts\r\nof the Countrey, they are found growing naturally in prettie groves. There\r\nwas an assay made to make silke, and surely the wormes prospered excellent\r\nwell, till the master workeman fell sicke. During which time they were\r\neaten with Rats.\r\n\r\n                             _Chesnuts._\r\n\r\nIn some parts were found some Chesnuts, whose wild fruit equalize the best\r\nin France, Spaine, Germany, or Italy. Plums there are of three sorts. The\r\nred and white are like our hedge plums, but the other which they call\r\nPutchamins, grow as high as a Palmeta: the fruit is like a Medler; it is\r\nfirst greene, then yellow, and red when it is ripe; if it be not ripe, it\r\nwill draw a mans mouth awry, with much torment, but when it is ripe, it is\r\nas delicious as an Apricot.\r\n\r\n                                 _Cherries._\r\n\r\n                                _Vines._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                            _Chechinquamins._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\n                              _Rawcomens._ {MN-3}\r\n\r\n                            _How they use their fruits._ {MN-4}\r\n\r\n                            _Walnut milke._ {MN-5}\r\n\r\n                               _Gummes._ {MN-6}\r\n\r\n                               _Cedars._ {MN-7}\r\n\r\n                            _Saxafras trees._ {MN-8}\r\n\r\nThey have Cherries, and those are much like a Damson, but for their tastes\r\nand colour we called them Cherries. We saw some few Crabs, but very small\r\nand bitter. {MN-1} Of vines great abundance in many parts that climbe the\r\ntoppes of the highest trees in some places, but these beare but few\r\ngrapes. Except by the rivers & savage habitations, where they are not\r\novershadowed from the sunne, they are covered with fruit, though never\r\npruined nor manured. Of those hedge grapes we made neere twentie gallons\r\nof wine, which was like our French Brittish wine, but certainely they\r\nwould prove good were they well manured. There is another sort of grape\r\nneere as great as a Cherry, this they call Messamins, they be fatte, and\r\nthe juyce thicke. Neither doth the taste so well please when they are made\r\nin wine. They have a small fruit growing on little trees, husked like a\r\nChesnut, but the fruit most like a very small Acorne. {MN-2} This they\r\ncall Chechinquamins, which they esteeme a great daintie. They have a berry\r\nmuch like our Gooseberry, in greatnesse, colour, and tast; {MN-3} those\r\nthey call Rawcomens, and doe eat them raw or boyled. Of these naturall\r\nfruits they live a great part of the yeare, which they use in this manner;\r\n{MN-4} The Walnuts, Chesnuts, Acornes, and Chechinquamins are dryed to\r\nkeepe. When they need walnuts they breake them betweene two stones, yet\r\nsome part of the shels will cleave to the fruit. Then doe they dry them\r\nagaine upon a Mat over a hurdle. After they put it into a morter of wood,\r\nand beat it very small: {MN-5} that done they mix it with water, that the\r\nshels may sinke to the bottome. This water will be coloured as milke,\r\nwhich they call Pawcohiccora, and keepe it for their use. The fruit like\r\nMedlers they call Putchamins, they cast upon hurdles on a Mat, and\r\npreserve them as Pruines. Of their Chesnuts and Chechinquamins boyled,\r\nthey make both broath and bread for their chiefe men, or at their greatest\r\nfeasts. Besides those fruit trees, there is a {MN-6} white Popular, and\r\nanother tree like unto it, that yeeldeth a very cleare and an odoriferous\r\nGumme like Turpentine, which some called Balsom. There are also {MN-7}\r\nCedars and {MN-8} Saxafras trees. They also yeeld gummes in a small\r\nproportion of themselves. Wee tryed conclusions to extract it out of the\r\nwood, but nature afforded more then our arts.\r\n\r\n                            _Berries._\r\n\r\n                           _Matoun._ {MN}\r\n\r\nIn the watry valleyes groweth a Berry which they call Ocoughtanamnis very\r\nmuch like unto Capers. These they dry in sommer. When they eat them they\r\nboile them neare halfe a day; for otherwise they differ not much from\r\npoyson. {MN} Mattoum groweth as our Bents. The seed is not much unlike to\r\nRie, though much smaller. This they use for a daintie bread buttered with\r\ndeare suet.\r\n\r\n                             _Strawberries._\r\n\r\n                             _Hearbes._ {MN}\r\n\r\nDuring Sommer there are either Strawberries, which ripen in Aprill, or\r\nMulberries which ripen in May and June. Raspises, hurts; or a fruit that\r\nthe inhabitants call Maracocks, which is a pleasant wholsome fruit much\r\nlike a Lemond. {MN} Many herbes in the spring are commonly dispersed\r\nthroughout the woods, good for brothes and sallets, as Violets, Purslain,\r\nSorrell, &c. Besides many we used whose names we know not.\r\n\r\n                                _Rootes._\r\n\r\nThe chiefe root they have for food is called Tockawhoughe. It groweth like\r\na flagge in Marishes. In one day a Salvage will gather sufficient for a\r\nweeke. These roots are much of the greatnesse and taste of Potatoes. They\r\nuse to cover a great many of them with Oke leaves and Ferne, and then\r\ncover all with earth in the manner of a Colepit; over it, on each side,\r\nthey continue a great fire 24 houres before they dare eat it. Raw it is no\r\n[II.27.] better then poyson, and being rosted, except it be tender and the\r\nheat abated, or sliced and dryed in the Sunne, mixed with sorrell and\r\nmeale or such like, it will prickle and torment the throat extreamely, and\r\nyet in sommer they use this ordinarily for bread.\r\n\r\n                              _Wighsacan a roote._\r\n\r\n                        _Pocones a small roote._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                        _Musquaspen a roote._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nThey have another roote which they call Wighsacan: as th'other feedeth the\r\nbody, so this cureth their hurts and diseases. It is a small root which\r\nthey bruise and apply to the wound. {MN-1} Pocones is a small root that\r\ngroweth in the mountaines, which being dryed and beate in powder turneth\r\nred. And this they use for swellings, aches, annointing their joynts,\r\npainting their heads and garments. They account it very precious, and of\r\nmuch worth. {MN-2} Musquaspen is a roote of the bignesse of a finger, and\r\nas red as bloud. In drying, it will wither almost to nothing. This they\r\nuse to paint their Mattes, Targets, and such like.\r\n\r\n                       _Pellitory. Sasafrage._\r\n\r\nThere is also Pellitory of Spaine, Sasafrage, and divers other simples,\r\nwhich the Apothecaries gathered, and commended to be good, and\r\nmedicinable.\r\n\r\n                                _Onyons._\r\n\r\nIn the low Marishes grow plots of Onyons, containing an Acre of ground or\r\nmore in many places; but they are small, not past the bignesse of the\r\ntoppe of ones Thumbe.\r\n\r\n                      _Their chiefe beasts are Deere._\r\n\r\n                         _Aroughcun._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                            _Squirrels._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nOf beasts the chiefe are Deere, nothing differing from ours. In the\r\ndeserts towards the heads of the rivers, there are many, but amongst the\r\nrivers few. {MN-1} There is a beast they call Aroughcun, much like a\r\nbadger, but useth to live on trees as Squirrels doe. {MN-2} Their\r\nSquirrels some are neare as great as our smallest sort of wilde Rabbets,\r\nsome blackish or blacke and white, but the most are gray.\r\n\r\n                    _Assapanick, a squirrel flying._\r\n\r\n                          _Oppasum._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                         _Mussacus._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nA small beast they have they call Assapanick, but we call them flying\r\nSquirrels, because spreading their legs, and so stretching the largenesse\r\nof their skins, that they have beene seene to fly 30 or 40 yards. {MN-1}\r\nAn Opassom hath a head like a Swine, and a taile like a Rat, and is of the\r\nbignesse of a Cat. Under her belly shee hath a bagge, wherein she lodgeth,\r\ncarrieth, and suckleth her young. {MN-2} A Mussascus is a beast of the\r\nforme and nature of our water Rats, but many of them smell exceeding\r\nstrongly of Muske. Their Hares no bigger then our Conies, and few of them\r\nto be found.\r\n\r\n                            _Beares._\r\n\r\n                         _The Beaver._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                         _Otters._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\n                       _Utchunquoyes._ {MN-3}\r\n\r\n                           _Foxes._ {MN-4}\r\n\r\n                          _Dogges._ {MN-5}\r\n\r\n                          _Martins._ {MN-6}\r\n\r\n                         _Polecats._ {MN-7}\r\n\r\n                    _Weesels, and Minkes._ {MN-8}\r\n\r\nTheir Beares are very little in comparison of those of Muscovia and\r\nTartaria. {MN-1} The Beaver is as big as an ordinary water dog, but his\r\nlegs exceeding short. His forefeete like a dogs, his hinder feet like a\r\nSwans. His taile somewhat like the forme of a Racket, bare without haire,\r\nwhich to eat the Salvages esteeme a great delicate. {MN-2} They have many\r\nOtters, which as the Beavers they take with snares, and esteeme the skins\r\ngreat ornaments, and of all those beasts they use to feed when they catch\r\nthem. {MN-3} An Utchunquoyes is like a wilde Cat. {MN-4} Their Foxes are\r\nlike our silver haired Conies, of a small proportion, and not smelling\r\nlike those in England. {MN-5} Their Dogges of that Country are like their\r\nWoolves; and cannot barke but howle, and the Woolves not much bigger then\r\nour English Foxes. {MN-6} Martins, {MN-7} Polecats, {MN-8} Weesels, and\r\nMinkes we know they have, because we have seene many of their skinnes,\r\nthough very seldome any of them alive. But one thing is strange, that we\r\ncould never perceive their Vermine destroy our Hennes, Egges, nor Chickens,\r\nnor doe any hurt, nor their flyes nor serpents any way pernicious, where\r\nin the South parts of America they are alwayes dangerous, and often deadly.\r\n\r\n                            _Birds._\r\n\r\nOf Birds the Eagle is the greatest devourer. Hawkes there be of divers\r\nsorts, as our Falconers called them: Sparrow-hawkes, Lanarets, Goshawkes,\r\nFalcons and Osperayes, but they all prey most upon fish. Their Partridges\r\nare little bigger then our Quailes. Wilde Turkies are as bigge as our\r\ntame. There are Woosels or Blackbirds with red shoulders, Thrushes and\r\ndivers sorts of small Birds, some red, some blew, scarce so bigge as a\r\nWrenne, but few in Sommer. In Winter there are great plentie of Swans,\r\nCranes, gray and white with blacke wings, Herons, Geese, Brants, Ducke,\r\nWigeon, Dotterell, Oxeies, Parrats, and Pigeons. Of all those sorts great\r\nabundance, and some other strange kinds, to us unknowne by name. But in\r\nSommer not any, or a very few to be seene.\r\n\r\n                             _Fish._\r\n\r\nOf fish we were best acquainted with Sturgeon, Grampus, Porpus, Seales,\r\nStingraies, whose tailes are very [II.28.] dangerous. Bretts, Mullets,\r\nwhite Salmonds, Trowts, Soles, Plaice, Herrings, Conyfish, Rockfish,\r\nEeles, Lampreys, Catfish, Shades, Pearch of three sorts, Crabs, Shrimps,\r\nCrevises, Oysters, Cocles, and Muscles. But the most strange fish is a\r\nsmall one, so like the picture of St. George his Dragon, as possible can\r\nbe, except his legs and wings, and the Toadefish, which will swell till it\r\nbe like to burst, when it commeth into the ayre.\r\n\r\n                         _The rockes._\r\n\r\nConcerning the entrailes of the earth, little can be said for certaintie.\r\nThere wanted good Refiners; for those that tooke upon them to have skill\r\nthis way, tooke up the washings from the mountaines, and some moskered\r\nshining stones and spangles which the waters brought downe, flattering\r\nthemselves in their owne vaine conceits to have beene supposed what they\r\nwere not, by the meanes of that ore, if it proved as their arts and\r\njudgements expected. Onely this is certaine, that many regions lying in\r\nthe same latitude, afford Mines very rich of divers natures. The crust\r\nalso of these rockes would easily perswade a man to beleeve there are\r\nother Mines then yron and steele, if there were but meanes and men of\r\nexperience that knew the Mine from Spar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Of their Planted fruits in Virginia, and how they use them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _How they divide the year._\r\n\r\nThey divide the yeare into five seasons. Their winter some call Popanow,\r\nthe spring Cattapeuk, the sommer Cohattayough, the earing of their Corne\r\nNepinough, the harvest and fall of leafe Taquitock. From September untill\r\nthe midst of November are the chiefe feasts & sacrifice. Then have they\r\nplentie of fruits as well planted as naturall, as corne, greene and ripe,\r\nfish, fowle, and wilde beasts exceeding fat.\r\n\r\n                        _How they prepare the ground._\r\n\r\nThe greatest labour they take, is in planting their corne, for the Country\r\nnaturally is overgrowne with wood. To prepare the ground they bruise the\r\nbarke of the trees neare the root, then doe they scortch the roots with\r\nfire that they grow no more. The next yeare with a crooked peece of wood\r\nthey beat up the weeds by the rootes, and in that mould they plant their\r\nCorne. Their manner is this. They make a hole in the earth with a sticke,\r\nand into it they put foure graines of wheate and two of beanes. These\r\nholes they make foure foote one from another; Their women and children do\r\ncontinually keepe it with weeding, and when it is growne middle high, they\r\nhill it about like a hop-yard.\r\n\r\n                          _How they plant._\r\n\r\nIn Aprill they begin to plant, but their chiefe plantation is in May, and\r\nso they continue till the midst of June. What they plant in Aprill they\r\nreape in August, for May in September, for June in October; Every stalke\r\nof their corne commonly beareth two eares, some three, seldome any foure,\r\nmany but one, and some none. Every eare ordinarily hath betwixt 200 and\r\n500 graines. The stalke being greene hath a sweet juice in it, somewhat\r\nlike a sugar Cane, which is the cause that when they gather their corne\r\ngreene, they sucke the stalkes: for as we gather greene pease, so doe they\r\ntheir corne being greene, which excelleth their old. They plant also pease\r\nthey call Assentamens, which are the same they call in Italy, Fagioli.\r\nTheir Beanes are the same the Turkes call Garnanses, but these they much\r\nesteeme for dainties.\r\n\r\n                   _How they use their corne._\r\n\r\n              _How they use their fish and flesh._ {MN}\r\n\r\nTheir corne they rost in the eare greene, and bruising it in a morter of\r\nwood with a Polt, lap it in rowles in the leaves of their corne, and so\r\nboyle it for a daintie. They also reserve that corne late planted that\r\nwill not ripe, by roasting it in hot ashes, the heat thereof drying it. In\r\nwinter they esteeme it being boyled with beanes for a rare dish, they call\r\nPausarowmena. Their old wheat they first steepe a night in hot water, in\r\nthe morning pounding it in a morter. They use a small basket for their\r\nTemmes, then pound againe the great, and so separating by dashing their\r\nhand in the basket, receive the flower in a platter made of wood, scraped\r\nto that forme with burning and shels. Tempering this flower [II.29] with\r\nwater, they make it either in cakes, covering them with ashes till they be\r\nbaked, and then washing them in faire water, they drie presently with\r\ntheir owne heat: or else boyle them in water, eating the broth with the\r\nbread which they call Ponap. The groutes and peeces of the cornes\r\nremaining, by fanning in a Platter or in the wind away the branne, they\r\nboyle 3 or 4 houres with water, which is an ordinary food they call\r\nUstatahamen. But some more thriftie then cleanly, doe burne the core\r\nof the eare to powder, which they call Pungnough, mingling that in their\r\nmeale, but it never tasted well in bread, nor broth. {MN} Their fish &\r\nflesh they boyle either very tenderly, or boyle it so long on hurdles over\r\nthe fire, or else after the Spanish fashion, putting it on a spit, they\r\nturne first the one side, then the other, till it be as drie as their\r\njerkin Beefe in the west Indies, that they may keepe it a moneth or more\r\nwithout putrifying. The broth of fish or flesh they eat as commonly as the\r\nmeat.\r\n\r\n                       _Planted fruits._\r\n\r\nIn May also amongst their corne they plant Pumpeons, and a fruit like\r\nunto a muske mellon, but lesse and worse, which they call Macocks. These\r\nincrease exceedingly, and ripen in the beginning of July, and continue\r\nuntill September. They plant also Maracocks a wild fruit like a Lemmon,\r\nwhich also increase infinitely. They begin to ripe in September, and\r\ncontinue till the end of October. When all their fruits be gathered,\r\nlittle els they plant, and this is done by their women and children;\r\nneither doth this long suffice them, for neare three parts of the yeare,\r\nthey onely observe times and seasons, and live of what the Country\r\nnaturally affordeth from hand to mouth, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      The Commodities in Virginia, or that may be had by Industrie.\r\n\r\n\r\n            _A proofe cattell will live well._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThe mildnesse of the ayre, the fertilitie of the soyle, and situation of\r\nthe rivers are so propitious to the nature and use of man, as no place is\r\nmore convenient for pleasure, profit, and mans sustenance, under that\r\nlatitude or climat. {MN} Here will live any beasts, as horses, goats,\r\nsheepe, asses, hens, &c. as appeared by them that were carried thether.\r\nThe waters, Isles, and shoales, are full of safe harbours for ships of\r\nwarre or marchandize, for boats of all sorts, for transportation or\r\nfishing, &c. The Bay and rivers have much marchantable fish, and places\r\nfit for Salt coats, building of ships, making of Iron, &c.\r\n\r\n                         _The Commodities._\r\n\r\nMuscovia and Polonia doe yearely receive many thousands, for pitch, tarre,\r\nsope-ashes, Rosen, Flax, Cordage, Sturgeon, Masts, Yards, Wainscot,\r\nFirres, Glasse, and such like; also Swethland for Iron and Copper. France\r\nin like manner, for Wine, Canvas, and Salt. Spaine as much for Iron,\r\nSteele, Figges, Reasons, and Sackes. Italy with Silkes and Velvets\r\nconsumes our chiefe Commodities. Holland maintaines it selfe by fishing\r\nand trading at our owne doores. All these temporize with other for\r\nnecessities, but all as uncertaine as peace or warres. Besides the charge,\r\ntravell, and danger in transporting them, by seas, lands, stormes, and\r\nPyrats. Then how much hath Virginia the prerogative of all those\r\nflourishing Kingdomes, for the benefit of our Land, when as within one\r\nhundred myles all those are to be had, either ready provided by nature, or\r\nelse to be prepared, were there but industrious men to labour. Onely of\r\nCopper we may doubt is wanting, but there is good probabilitie that both\r\nCopper and better Minerals are there to be had for their labour. Other\r\nCountries have it. So then here is a place, a nurse for souldiers, a\r\npractise for mariners, a trade for marchants, a reward for the good, and\r\nthat which is most of all, a businesse (most acceptable to God) to bring\r\nsuch poore Infidels to the knowledge of God and His holy Gospell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                Of the naturall Inhabitants of Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _The numbers._\r\n\r\n  _Seaven hundred men were the most were seene together when they thought\r\n                   to have surprised Captaine Smith._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n               _A description of the people._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\n                         _The Barbers._ {MN-3}\r\n\r\n                         _The constitution._ {MN-4}\r\n\r\n                         _The disposition._ {MN-5}\r\n\r\n                         _The possessions._ {MN-6}\r\n\r\n                          _Their attire._ {MN-7}\r\n\r\n                        _Their ornaments._ {MN-8}\r\n\r\nThe land is not populous, for the men be few; their far greater number is\r\nof women and children. Within 60 myles of James Towne, there are about\r\nsome 5000 people, but of able men fit for their warres scarce [II.30] 1500.\r\nTo nourish so many together they have yet no meanes, because they make so\r\nsmall a benefit of their land, be it never so fertile. {MN-1} Six or seaven\r\nhundred have beene the most hath beene seene together, when they gathered\r\nthemselves to have surprised mee at Pamaunkee, having but fifteene to\r\nwithstand the worst or their fury. As small as the proportion of ground\r\nthat hath yet beene discovered, is in comparison of that yet unknowne:\r\n{MN-2} the people differ very much in stature, especially in language, as\r\nbefore is expressed. Some being very great as the Sasquesahananocks; others\r\nvery little, as the Wighcocomocoes: but generally tall and straight, of a\r\ncomely proportion, and of a colour browne when they are of any age, but\r\nthey are borne white. Their hayre is generally blacke, but few have any\r\nbeards. The men weare halfe their beards shaven, the other halfe long;\r\n{MN-3} for Barbers they use their women, who with two shels will grate away\r\nthe hayre, of any fashion they please. The women are cut in many fashions,\r\nagreeable to their yeares, but ever some part remaineth long. {MN-4} They\r\nare very strong, of an able body and full of agilitie, able to endure to\r\nlie in the woods under a tree by the fire, in the worst of winter, or in\r\nthe weedes and grasse, in Ambuscado in the Sommer. {MN-5} They are\r\ninconstant in every thing, but what feare constraineth them to keepe.\r\nCraftie, timerous, quicke of apprehension, and very ingenuous. Some are of\r\ndisposition fearefull, some bold, most cautelous, all Savage. Generally\r\ncovetous of Copper, Beads, and such like trash. They are soone moved to\r\nanger, and so malicious, that they seldome forget an injury: they seldome\r\nsteale one from another, least their conjurers should reveale it, and so\r\nthey be pursued and punished. That they are thus feared is certaine, but\r\nthat any can reveale their offences by conjuration I am doubtfull. Their\r\nwomen are carefull not to be suspected of dishonestie without the leave of\r\ntheir husbands. {MN-6} Each houshold knoweth their owne lands, and gardens,\r\nand most live of their owne labours. {MN-7} For their apparell, they are\r\nsometime covered with the skinnes of wilde beasts, which in Winter are\r\ndressed with the hayre, but in Sommer without. The better sort use large\r\nmantels of Deare skins, not much differing in fashion from the Irish\r\nmantels. Some imbrodered with white beads, some with Copper, other painted\r\nafter their manner. But the common sort have scarce to cover their\r\nnakednesse, but with grasse, the leaves of trees, or such like. We have\r\nseene some use mantels made of Turky feathers, so prettily wrought & woven\r\nwith threads that nothing could be discerned but the feathers. That was\r\nexceeding warme and very handsome. But the women are alwayes covered about\r\ntheir middles with a skin, and very shame-fast to be seene bare. {MN-8}\r\nThey adorne themselves most with Their copper beads and paintings. Their\r\nwomen, some have ornaments, their legs, hands, breasts and face cunningly\r\nimbrodered with divers workes, as beasts, serpents, artificially wrought\r\ninto their flesh with blacke spots. In each eare commonly they have 3 great\r\nholes, whereat they hang chaines, bracelets, or copper. Some of their men\r\nweare in those holes, a small greene and yellow coloured snake, neare halfe\r\na yard in length, which crawling and lapping her selfe about his necke\r\noftentimes familiarly would kisse his lips. Others weare a dead Rat tyed\r\nby the taile. Some on their heads weare the wing of a bird, or some large\r\nfeather with a Rattell. Those Rattels are somewhat like the chape of a\r\nRapier, but lesse, which they take from the taile of a snake. Many have\r\nthe whole skinne of a Hawke or some strange foule, stuffed with the wings\r\nabroad. Others a broad peece of Copper, and some the hand of their enemy\r\ndryed. Their heads and shoulders are painted red with the roote Pocone\r\nbrayed to powder, mixed with oyle, this they hold in sommer to preserve\r\nthem from the heate, and in winter from the cold. Many other formes of\r\npaintings they use, but he is the most gallant that is the most monstrous\r\nto behold.\r\n\r\n                        _Their buildings._\r\n\r\nTheir buildings and habitations are for the most part by the rivers, or\r\nnot farre distant from some fresh spring. Their houses are built like our\r\nArbors, of small young springs bowed and tyed, and so close covered with\r\nMats, or the barkes of trees very handsomely, that notwithstanding either\r\nwinde, raine, or weather, they are as warme as stooves, but very smoaky,\r\nyet at the toppe of the house there is a hole made for the smoake to goe\r\ninto right over the fire.\r\n\r\n                         _Their lodgings._\r\n\r\n                       _Their gardens._ {MN}\r\n\r\nAgainst the fire they lie on little hurdles of Reeds [II.31.] covered with\r\na Mat, borne from the ground a foote and more by a hurdle of wood. On\r\nthese round about the house they lie heads and points one by th'other\r\nagainst the fire, some covered with Mats, some with skins, and some\r\nstarke naked lie on the ground, from 6 to 20 in a house. {MN} Their houses\r\nare in the midst of their fields or gardens, which are small plots of\r\nground. Some 20 acres, some 40. some 100. some 200. some more, some lesse.\r\nIn some places from 2 to 50 of those houses together, or but a little\r\nseparated by groves of trees. Neare their habitations is little small wood\r\nor old trees on the ground by reason of their burning of them for fire. So\r\nthat a man may gallop a horse amongst these woods any way, but where the\r\ncreekes or Rivers shall hinder.\r\n\r\n                    _How they use their children._\r\n\r\nMen, women, and children have their severall names according to the\r\nseverall humor of their Parents. Their women (they say) are easily\r\ndelivered of childe, yet doe they love children very dearely. To make them\r\nhardie, in the coldest mornings they them wash in the rivers, and by\r\npainting and oyntments so tanne their skinnes, that after a yeare or two,\r\nno weather will hurt them.\r\n\r\n                    _The industrie of their women._\r\n\r\nThe men bestow their times in fishing, hunting, warres, and such man-like\r\nexercises, scorning to be seene in any woman-like exercise, which is the\r\ncause that the women be very painefull, and the men often idle. The women\r\nand children doe the rest of the worke. They make mats, baskets, pots,\r\nmorters, pound their corne, make their bread, prepare their victuals,\r\nplant their corne, gather their corne, beare all kind of burdens, and such\r\nlike.\r\n\r\n                       _How they strike fire._\r\n\r\n                      _The order of dyet._ {MN}\r\n\r\nTheir fire they kindle presently by chafing a dry pointed sticke in a hole\r\nof a little square peece of wood, that firing it selfe, will so fire\r\nmosse, leaves, or any such like dry thing, that will quickly burne. {MN}\r\nIn March and Aprill they live much upon their fishing wires; and feed on\r\nfish, Turkies, and Squirrels. In May and June they plant their fields, and\r\nlive most of Acornes, Walnuts, and fish. But to amend their dyet, some\r\ndisperse themselves in small companies, and live upon fish, beasts, crabs,\r\noysters, land Tortoises, strawberries, mulberries, and such like. In June,\r\nJuly, and August, they feed upon the rootes of Tocknough berries, fish,\r\nand greene wheat. It is strange to see how their bodies alter with their\r\ndyet, even as the deere & wilde beasts they seeme fat and leane, strong\r\nand weake. Powhatan their great King, and some others that are provident,\r\nrost their fish and flesh upon hurdles as before is expressed, and keepe\r\nit till scarce times.\r\n\r\n               _How they make their bowes and arrowes._\r\n\r\n                        _Their knives._ {MN}\r\n\r\nFor fishing, hunting, and warres they use much their bow and arrowes. They\r\nbring their bowes to the forme of ours by the scraping of a shell. Their\r\narrowes are made some of straight young sprigs, which they head with bone,\r\nsome 2 or 3 ynches long. These they use to shoot at Squirrels on trees.\r\nAnother sort of arrowes they use made of Reeds. These are peeced with\r\nwood, headed with splinters of christall, or some sharpe stone, the\r\nspurres of a Turkey, or the bill of some bird. {MN} For his knife he hath\r\nthe splinter of a Reed to cut his feathers in forme. With this knife also,\r\nhe will joynt a Deere, or any beast, shape his shooes, buskins, mantels,\r\n&c. To make the noch of his arrow he hath the tooth of a Beaver, set in a\r\nsticke, wherewith he grateth it by degrees. His arrow head he quickly\r\nmaketh with a little bone, which he ever weareth at his bracert, of any\r\nsplint of a stone, or glasse in the forme of a heart, and these they glew\r\nto the end of their arrowes. With the sinewes of Deere, and the tops of\r\nDeeres hornes boyled to a jelly, they make a glew that will not dissolve\r\nin cold water.\r\n\r\n                    _Their Targets and Swords._\r\n\r\nFor their warres also they use Targets that are round and made of the\r\nbarkes of trees, and a sword of wood and at their backes, but oftentimes\r\nthey use for swords the horne of a Deere put through a peece of wood in\r\nforme of a Pickaxe. Some a long stone sharpned at both ends, used in the\r\nsame manner. This they were wont to use also for hatchets, but now by\r\ntrucking they have plentie of the same forme of yron. And those are their\r\nchiefe instruments and armes.\r\n\r\n                         _Their boats_\r\n\r\n                    _How they spin._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                   _Their fish hookes._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nTheir fishing is much in Boats. These they make of one tree by burning and\r\nscratching away the coales with stones and shels, till they have made it\r\nin forme of a [II.32.] Trough. Some of them are an elne deepe, and fortie\r\nor fiftie foote in length, and some will beare 40 men, but the most\r\nordinary are smaller, and will beare 10, 20, or 30. according to their\r\nbignesse. In stead of Oares, they use Paddles and stickes, with which they\r\nwill row faster then our Barges. {MN-1} Betwixt their hands and thighes,\r\ntheir women use to spin the barkes of trees, Deere sinewes, or a kind of\r\ngrasse they call Pemmenaw, of these they make a thread very even and\r\nreadily. This thread serveth for many uses. As about their housing,\r\napparell, as also they make nets for fishing, for the quantitie as\r\nformally braded as ours. They make also with it lines for angles. {MN-2}\r\nTheir hookes are either a bone grated as they noch their arrowes in the\r\nforme of a crooked pinne or fish-hooke, or of the splinter of a bone tyed\r\nto the clift of a little sticke, and with the end of the line, they tie on\r\nthe bait. They use also long arrowes tyed in a line, wherewith they\r\nshoote at fish in the rivers. But they of Accawmack use staves like unto\r\nJavelins headed with bone. With these they dart fish swimming in the\r\nwater. They have also many artificiall wires, in which they get abundance\r\nof fish.\r\n\r\n                           _How they hunt._\r\n\r\nIn their hunting and fishing they take extreame paines; yet it being their\r\nordinary exercise from their infancy, they esteeme it a pleasure and are\r\nvery proud to be expert therein. And by their continuall ranging, and\r\ntravell, they know all the advantages and places most frequented with\r\nDeere, Beasts, Fish, Foule, Roots, and Berries. At their huntings they\r\nleave their habitations, and reduce themselves into companies, as the\r\nTartars doe, and goe to the most desert places with their families, where\r\nthey spend their time in hunting and fowling up towards the mountaines, by\r\nthe heads of their rivers, where there is plentie of game. For betwixt the\r\nrivers the grounds are so narrowe, that little commeth here which they\r\ndevoure not. It is a marvell they can so directly passe these deserts,\r\nsome 3 or 4 dayes journey without habitation. Their hunting houses are\r\nlike unto Arbours covered with Mats. These their women beare after them,\r\nwith Corne, Acornes, Morters, and all bag and baggage they use. When they\r\ncome to the place of exercise, every man doth his best to shew his\r\ndexteritie, for by their excelling in those qualities, they get their\r\nwives. Fortie yards will they shoot levell, or very neare the marke, and\r\n120 is their best at Random. At their huntings in the deserts they are\r\ncommonly two or three hundred together. Having found the Deere, they\r\nenviron them with many fires, & betwixt the fires they place themselves.\r\nAnd some take their stands in the midsts. The Deere being thus feared by\r\nthe fires, and their voyces, they chase them so long within that circle,\r\nthat many times they kill 6, 8, 10, or 15 at a hunting. They use also to\r\ndrive them into some narrow poynt of land, when they find that advantage;\r\nand so force them into the river, where with their boats they have\r\nAmbuscadoes to kill them. When they have shot a Deere by land, they follow\r\nhim like blond-hounds by the bloud, and straine, and oftentimes so take\r\nthem. Hares, Partridges, Turkies, or Egges, fat or leane, young or old,\r\nthey devoure all they can catch in their power. In one of these huntings\r\nthey found me in the discovery of the head of the river of Chickahamania,\r\nwhere they slew my men, and tooke me prisoner in a Bogmire, where I saw\r\nthose exercises, and gathered these Observations.\r\n\r\n                   _One Salvage hunting alone._\r\n\r\nOne Salvage hunting alone, useth the skinne of a Deere slit on the one\r\nside, and so put on his arme, through the neck, so that his hand comes to\r\nthe head which is stuffed, and the hornes, head, eyes, eares, and every\r\npart as artificially counterfeited as they, can devise. Thus shrowding\r\nhis body in the skinne by stalking, he approacheth the Deere, creeping on\r\nthe ground from one tree to another. If the Deere chance to find fault, or\r\nstand at gaze, he turneth the head with his hand to his best advantage to\r\nseeme like a Deere, also gazing and licking himselfe. So watching his best\r\nadvantage to approach, having shot him, he chaseth him by his bloud and\r\nstraine till he get him.\r\n\r\n                         _Their Consultations._\r\n\r\n                         _Their enemies._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                          _Massawomekes._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\n                    _Their offer of subjection._ {MN-3}\r\n\r\nWhen they intend any warres, the Werowances usually have the advice of\r\ntheir Priests and Conjurers, and their allies, and ancient friends, but\r\nchiefely the Priests determine their resolution. Every Werowance, or some\r\n[II.33.] lustie fellow, they appoint Captaine over every nation. They\r\nseldome make warre for lands or goods, but for women and children, and\r\nprincipally for revenge. {MN-1} They have many enemies, namely, all their\r\nwesternly Countries beyond the mountaines, and the heads of the rivers.\r\nUpon the head of the Powhatans are the Monacans, whose chiefe habitation\r\nis at Rasauweak, unto whom the Mowhemenchughes, the Massinnacacks, the\r\nMonahassanughs, the Monasickapanoughs, and other nations pay tributes.\r\nUpon the head of the river of Toppahanock is a people called Mannahoacks.\r\nTo these are contributers the Tauxanias, the Shackaconias, the Ontponeas,\r\nthe Tegninateos, the Whonkenteaes, the Stegarakes, the Hassianungaes, and\r\ndivers others, all confederates with the Monacans, though many different\r\nin language, and be very barbarous, living for the most part of wild\r\nbeasts and fruits. Beyond the mountaines from whence is the head of the\r\nriver Patawomeke, the Salvages report inhabit their most mortall enemies,\r\n{MN-2} the Massawomekes, upon a great salt water, which by all likelihood\r\nis either some part of Cannada, some great lake, or some inlet of some\r\nsea that falleth into the South sea. These Massawomekes are a great nation\r\nand very populous. For the heads of all those rivers, especially the\r\nPattawomekes, the Pautuxuntes, the Sasquesahanocks, the Tockwoughes are\r\ncontinually tormented by them: of whose crueltie, they generally\r\ncomplained, and very importunate they were with me, and my company to free\r\nthem from these tormentors. {MN-3} To this purpose they offered food,\r\nconduct, assistance, and continuall subjection. Which I concluded to\r\neffect. But the councell then present emulating my successe, would not\r\nthinke it fit to spare me fortie men to be hazzarded in those unknowne\r\nregions, having passed (as before was spoken of) but with 12, and so was\r\nlost that opportunitie. Seaven boats full of these Massawomekes wee\r\nencountred at the head of the Bay; whose Targets, Baskets, Swords, Tobacco\r\npipes, Platters, Bowes, and Arrowes, and every thing shewed, they much\r\nexceeded them of our parts, and their dexteritie in their small boats,\r\nmade of the barkes of trees, sowed with barke and well luted with gumme,\r\nargueth that they are seated upon some great water.\r\n\r\nAgainst all these enemies the Powhatans are constrained sometimes to\r\nfight. Their chiefe attempts are by Stratagems, trecheries, or surprisals.\r\nYet the Werowances women and children they put not to death, but keepe\r\nthem Captives. They have a method in warre, and for our pleasures they\r\nshewed it us, and it was in this manner performed at Mattapanient.\r\n\r\n                   _Their manner of Battell._\r\n\r\nHaving painted and disguised themselves in the fiercest manner they could\r\ndevise, they divided themselves into two Companies, neare a hundred in a\r\ncompany. The one company called Monacans, the other Powhatans. Either army\r\nhad their Captaine. These as enemies tooke their stands a musket shot one\r\nfrom another; ranked themselves 15 a breast, and each ranke from another\r\n4 or 5 yards, not in fyle, but in the opening betwixt their fyles. So the\r\nReare could shoot as conveniently as the Front. Having thus pitched the\r\nfields: from either part went a messenger with these conditions, that\r\nwhosoever were vanquished, such as escape upon their submission in two\r\ndayes after should live, but their wives and children should be prize for\r\nthe Conquerours. The messengers were no sooner returned, but they\r\napproached in their orders; On each flanke a Serjeant, and in the Reare an\r\nOfficer for Lieutenant, all duly keeping their orders, yet leaping and\r\nsinging after their accustomed tune, which they onely use in Warres. Upon\r\nthe first flight of arrowes they gave such horrible shouts and screeches,\r\nas so many infernall hell-hounds could not have made them more terrible.\r\nWhen they had spent their arrowes, they joyned together prettily, charging\r\nand retyring, every ranke seconding other. As they got advantage they\r\ncatched their enemies by the hayre of the head, and downe he came that was\r\ntaken. His enemy with his wooden sword seemed to beat out his braines, and\r\nstill they crept to the Reare, to maintaine the skirmish. The Monacans\r\ndecreasing, the Powhatans charged them in the forme of a halfe Moone; they\r\nunwilling to be inclosed, fled all in a troope to their Ambuscadoes, on\r\nwhom they led them very cunningly. The Monacans disperse themselves\r\n[II.34.] among the fresh men, whereupon the Powhatans retired, with all\r\nspeed to their seconds; which the Monacans seeing, tooke that advantage to\r\nretire againe to their owne battell, and so each returned to their owne\r\nquarter. All their actions, voyces, and gestures, both in charging and\r\nretiring were so strained to the height of their qualitie and nature, that\r\nthe strangenesse thereof made it seeme very delightfull.\r\n\r\n                        _Their Musicke._\r\n\r\n                    _Their entertainment._ {MN}\r\n\r\nFor their Musicke they use a thicke Cane, on which they pipe as on a\r\nRecorder. For their warres they have a great deepe platter of wood. They\r\ncover the mouth thereof with a skin, at each corner they tie a walnut,\r\nwhich meeting on the backside neere the bottome, with a small rope they\r\ntwitch them together till it be so tought and stiffe, that they may beat\r\nupon it as upon a drumme. But their chiefe instruments are Rattles made of\r\nsmall gourds, or Pumpeons shels. Of these they have Base, Tenor,\r\nCountertenor, Meane, and Treble. These mingled with their voyces sometimes\r\ntwenty or thirtie together, make such a terrible noise as would rather\r\naffright, then delight any man. {MN} If any great commander arrive at the\r\nhabitation of Werowance, they spread a Mat as the Turkes doe a Carpet for\r\nhim to sit upon. Upon another right opposite they sit themselves. Then doe\r\nall with a tunable voice of shouting bid him welcome. After this doe two\r\nor more of their chiefest men make an Oration, testifying their love.\r\nWhich they doe with such vehemency, and so great passions, that they sweat\r\ntill they drop, and are so out of breath they can scarce speake. So that a\r\nman would take them to be exceeding angry, or stark mad. Such victuall as\r\nthey have, they spend freely, and at night where his lodging is appointed,\r\nthey set a woman fresh painted red with Pocones and oyle, to be his\r\nbed-fellow.\r\n\r\n                             _Their trade._\r\n\r\nTheir manner of trading is for copper, beads, and such like, for which\r\nthey give such commodities as they have, as skins, foule, fish, flesh,\r\nand their Country Corne. But their victualls are their chiefest riches.\r\n\r\n                           _Their Physicke._\r\n\r\n                       _Their Chirurgery._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                     _Their charms to cure._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nEvery spring they make themselves sicke with drinking the juyce of a roote\r\nthey call Wighsacan, and water; whereof they powre so great a quantitie,\r\nthat it purgeth them in a very violent manner; so that in three or foure\r\ndayes after, they scarce recover their former health. Sometimes they are\r\ntroubled with dropsies, swellings, aches, and such like diseases; {MN-1}\r\nfor cure whereof they build a Stove in the forme of a Dove-house with\r\nmats, so close that a few coales therein covered with a pot, will make the\r\npatient sweat extreamely. For swellings also they use small peeces of\r\ntouchwood, in the forme of cloves, which pricking on the griefe they\r\nburne close to the flesh, and from thence draw the corruption with their\r\nmouth. With this roote Wighsacan they ordinarily heale greene wounds. But\r\nto scarrifie a swelling, or make incision, their best instruments are some\r\nsplinted stone. Old ulcers, or putrified hurts are seldome seene cured\r\namongst them. {MN-2} They have many professed Phisicians, who with their\r\ncharmes and Rattles, with an infernall rout of words and actions, will\r\nseeme to sucke their inward griefe from their navels, or their grieved\r\nplaces; but of our Chirurgians they were so conceited, that they beleeved\r\nany Plaister would heale any hurt.\r\n\r\n            But 'tis not alwayes in Phisicians skill,\r\n            To heale the Patient that is sicke and ill:\r\n            For sometimes sicknesse on the Patients part,\r\n            Proves stronger farre then all Phisicians art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Of their Religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Their God._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                   _How they bury their Kings._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nThere is yet in Virginia no place discovered to be so Savage, in which\r\nthey have not a Religion, Deere, and Bow, and Arrowes. All things that are\r\nable to doe them hurt beyond their prevention, they adore with their kinde\r\nof divine worship; as the fire, water, lightning, thunder, our Ordnance,\r\npeeces, horses, &c. {MN-1} But their chiefe God they worship is the\r\nDevill. Him they call [II.35.] Okee, and serve him more of feare then\r\nlove. They say they have conference with him, and fashion themselves as\r\nneare to his shape as they can imagine. In their Temples they have his\r\nimage evill favouredly carved, and then painted and adorned with chaines\r\nof copper, and beads, and covered with a skin, in such manner as the\r\ndeformitie may well suit with such a God. {MN-2} By him is commonly the\r\nsepulcher of their Kings. Their bodies are first bowelled, then dried upon\r\nhurdles till they be very dry, and so about the most of their joynts and\r\nnecke they hang bracelets, or chaines of copper, pearle, and such like, as\r\nthey use to weare, their inwards they stuffe with copper beads, hatchets,\r\nand such trash. Then lappe they them very carefully in white skins, and so\r\nrowle them in mats for their winding sheets. And in the Tombe which is an\r\narch made of mats, they lay them orderly. What remaineth of this kinde of\r\nwealth their Kings have, they set at their feet in baskets. These Temples\r\nand bodies are kept by their Priests.\r\n\r\n                        _Their ordinary burials._\r\n\r\nFor their ordinary burials, they dig a deepe hole in the earth with sharpe\r\nstakes, and the corpse being lapped in skins and mats with their jewels,\r\nthey lay them upon stickes in the ground, and so cover them with earth.\r\nThe buriall ended, the women being painted all their faces with blacke\r\ncole and oyle, doe sit twenty-foure houres in the houses mourning and\r\nlamenting by turnes, with such yelling and howling, as may expresse their\r\ngreat passions.\r\n\r\n                            _Their Temples._\r\n\r\nIn every Territory of a Werowance is a Temple and a Priest, two or\r\nthree or more. Their principall Temple or place of superstition is at\r\nUttamussack at Pamaunkee, neare unto which is a house, Temple, or place of\r\nPowhatans.\r\n\r\nUpon the top of certaine red sandy hils in the woods, there are three\r\ngreat houses filled with images of their Kings, and Devils, and Tombes of\r\ntheir Predecessors. Those houses are neare sixtie foot in length built\r\narbour-wise, after their building. This place they count so holy as that\r\nbut the Priests & Kings dare come into them; nor the Salvages dare not goe\r\nup the river in boats by it, but they solemnly cast some peece of copper,\r\nwhite beads, or Pocones into the river, for feare their Okee should be\r\noffended and revenged of them.\r\n\r\n    Thus, Feare was the first their Gods begot:\r\n          Till feare began, their Gods were not.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Their ornaments for their Priests._\r\n\r\nIn this place commonly are resident seaven Priests. The chiefe differed\r\nfrom the rest in his ornaments, but inferior Priests could hardly be\r\nknowne from the common people, but that they had not so many holes in\r\ntheir eares to hang their jewels at. The ornaments of the chiefe Priest\r\nwere certaine attires for his head made thus. They tooke a dosen, or 16,\r\nor more snakes skins and stuffed them with mosse, and of Weesels and other\r\nVermines skins a good many. All these they tie by their tailes, so as all\r\ntheir tailes meete in the toppe of their head like a great Tassell. Round\r\nabout this Tassell is as it were a crowne of feathers, the skins hang\r\nround about his head, necke, and shoulders, and in a manner cover his\r\nface. The faces of all their Priests are painted as ugly as they can\r\ndevise, in their hands they had every one his Rattle, some base, some\r\nsmaller. Their devotion was most in songs, which the chiefe Priest\r\nbeginneth and the rest followed him, sometimes he maketh invocations with\r\nbroken sentences by starts and strange passions, and at every pause, the\r\nrest give a short groane.\r\n\r\n          Thus seeke they in deepe foolishnesse,\r\n          To climbe the height of happinesse.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _The times of solemnities._\r\n\r\nIt could not be perceived that they keepe any day as more holy then other;\r\nBut onely in some great distresse of want, feare of enemies, times of\r\ntriumph and gathering together their fruits, the whole Country of men,\r\nwomen, and children come together to solemnities. The manner of their\r\ndevotion is, sometimes to make a great fire, in the house or fields, and\r\nall to sing and dance about it [II.36.] with Rattles and shouts together,\r\nfoure or five houres. Sometimes they set a man in the midst, and about him\r\nthey dance and sing, he all the while clapping his hands, as if he would\r\nkeepe time, and after their songs and dauncings ended they goe to their\r\nFeasts.\r\n\r\n           Through God begetting feare,\r\n           Mans blinded minde did reare\r\n           A hell-god to the ghosts;\r\n           A heaven-god to the hoasts;\r\n           Yea God unto the Seas:\r\n           Feare did create all these.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Their conjurations._\r\n\r\nThey have also divers conjurations, one they made when I was their\r\nprisoner; of which hereafter you shall reade at large.\r\n\r\n                           _Their altars._\r\n\r\n                    _Sacrifices to the water._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThey have also certaine Altar stones they call Pawcorances, but these\r\nstand from their Temples, some by their houses, others in the woods and\r\nwildernesses, where they have had any extraordinary accident, or\r\nincounter. And as you travell, at those stones they will tell you the\r\ncause why they were there erected, which from age to age they instruct\r\ntheir children, as their best records of antiquities. Upon these they\r\noffer bloud, Deere suet, and Tobacco. This they doe when they returne from\r\nthe Warres, from hunting, and upon many other occasions. They have also\r\nanother superstition that they use in stormes, when the waters are rough\r\nin the Rivers and Sea coasts. {MN} Their Conjurers runne to the water\r\nsides, or passing in their boats, after many hellish outcryes and\r\ninvocations, they cast Tobacco, Copper, Pocones, or such trash into the\r\nwater, to pacifie that God whom they thinke to be very angry in those\r\nstormes. Before their dinners and suppers the better sort will take the\r\nfirst bit, and cast it in the fire, which is all the grace they are knowne\r\nto use.\r\n\r\n         _Their solemn Sacrifices of children, which they\r\n                        call Black-boyes._\r\n\r\n        _Those Black-boyes are made so mad with a kind of drinke,\r\n         that they will doe any mischiefe, at the command of\r\n                         their Keepers._ {MN}\r\n\r\nIn some part of the Country they have yearely a sacrifice of children.\r\nSuch a one was at Quiyoughcohanock some ten myles from James Towne, and\r\nthus performed. Fifteene of the properest young boyes, betweene ten and\r\nfifteene yeares of age they painted white. Having brought them forth, the\r\npeople spent the forenoone in dancing and singing about them with Rattles.\r\nIn the afternoone they put those children to the roote of a tree. By them\r\nall the men stood in a guard, every one having a Bastinado in his hand,\r\nmade of reeds bound together. This made a lane betweene them all along,\r\nthrough which there were appointed five young men to fetch these children:\r\nso every one of the five went through the guard to fetch a childe each\r\nafter other by turnes, the guard fiercely beating them with their\r\nBastinadoes, and they patiently enduring and receiving all, defending the\r\nchildren with their naked bodies from the unmercifull blowes, that pay\r\nthem soundly, though the children escape. All this while the women weepe\r\nand cry out very passionately, providing mats, skins, mosse, and dry wood,\r\nas things fitting their childrens funerals. After the children were thus\r\npassed the guard, the guard tore down the trees, branches & boughs, with\r\nsuch violence that they rent the body, and made wreaths for their heads,\r\nor bedecked their hayre with the leaves. What els was done with the\r\nchildren, was not seene, but they were all cast on a heape, in a valley as\r\ndead, where they made a great feast for all the company. {MN} The\r\nWerowance being demanded the meaning of this sacrifice, answered that the\r\nchildren were not all dead, but that the Okee or Divell did sucke the\r\nbloud from their left breast, who chanced to be his by lot, till they were\r\ndead, but the rest were kept in the wildernesse by the young men till nine\r\nmoneths were expired, during which time they must not converse with any,\r\nand of these were made their Priests and Conjurers. This sacrifice they\r\nheld to be so necessary, that if they should omit it, their Okee or\r\nDevill, and all their other Quiyoughcosughes, which are their other Gods,\r\nwould let them have no Deere, Turkies, Corne, nor fish, and yet besides,\r\nhe would make a great slaughter amongst them.\r\n\r\n                    _Their resurrection._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThey thinke that their Werowances and Priests which they also esteeme\r\nQuiyoughcosughes, {MN} when they are dead, goe beyond the mountaines\r\ntowards the setting of the sunne; and ever remaine there in forme of their\r\nOkee, [II.37.] with their heads painted with oyle and Pocones, finely\r\ntrimmed with feathers, and shall have beads, hatchets, copper, and Tobacco,\r\ndoing nothing but dance and sing, with all their Predecessors. But the\r\ncommon people they suppose shall not live after death, but rot in their\r\ngraves like dead dogs.\r\n\r\nTo divert them from this blind Idolatry, we did our best endevours,\r\nchiefly with the Werowance of Quiyoughcohanock, whose devotion,\r\napprehension, and good disposition, much exceeded any in those Countries,\r\nwith whom although we could not as yet prevaile, to forsake his false\r\nGods, yet this he did beleeve that our God as much exceeded theirs, as our\r\nGunnes did their Bowes & Arrowes, and many times did send to me to James\r\nTowne, intreating me to pray to my God for raine, for their Gods would not\r\nsend them any. And in this lamentable ignorance doe these poore soules\r\nsacrifice themselves to the Devill, not knowing their Creator; and we had\r\nnot language sufficient, so plainly to expresse it as make them understand\r\nit; which God grant they may.\r\n\r\n      For, Religion 'tis that doth distinguish us,\r\n           From their bruit humor, well we may it know;\r\n           That can with understanding argue thus,\r\n           Our God is truth, but they cannot doe so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Of the manner of the Virginians Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _A description of Powhatan._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                  _His attendance and watch._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nAlthough the Country people be very barbarous, yet have they amongst them\r\nsuch government, as that their Magistrates for good commanding, and their\r\npeople for due subjection, and obeying, excell many places that would be\r\ncounted very civill. The forme of their Common-wealth is a Monarchiall\r\ngovernment, one as Emperour ruleth over many Kings or Governours. Their\r\nchiefe ruler is called Powhatan, and taketh his name of his principall\r\nplace of dwelling called Powhatan. But his proper name is Wahunsonacock.\r\nSome Countries he hath which have beene his ancestors, and came unto him\r\nby inheritance, as the Country called Powhatan, Arrohateck, Appamatuck,\r\nPamaunkee, Youghtanund, and Mattapanient. All the rest of his Territories\r\nexpressed in the Mappe, they report have beene his severall Conquests. In\r\nall his ancient inheritances, he hath houses built after their manner like\r\narbours, some 30. some 40. yards long, and at every house provision for\r\nhis entertainement according to the time. At Werowcomoco on the Northside\r\nof the river Pamaunkee, was his residence, when I was delivered him\r\nprisoner, some 14 myles from James Towne, where for the most part, he was\r\nresident, but at last he tooke so little pleasure in our neare\r\nneighbourhood, that he retired himselfe to Orapakes, in the desert betwixt\r\nChickahamania and Youghtanund. {MN-1} He is of personage a tall well\r\nproportioned man, with a sower looke, his head somwhat gray, his beard so\r\nthinne, that it seemeth none at all, his age neare sixtie; of a very able\r\nand hardy body to endure any labour. {MN-2} About his person ordinarily\r\nattendeth a guard of 40 or 50 of the tallest men his Countrey doth afford.\r\nEvery night and watch upon the foure quarters of his house are foure\r\nSentinels, each from other a flight shoot, and at every halfe houre one\r\nfrom the Corps du guard doth hollow, shaking his lips with his finger\r\nbetweene them; unto whom every Sentinell doth answer round from his stand:\r\nif any faile, they presently send forth an officer that beateth him\r\nextreamely.\r\n\r\n                           _His treasury._\r\n\r\nA myle from Orapakes in a thicket of wood, he hath a house in which he\r\nkeepeth his kinde of Treasure, as skinnes, copper, pearle, and beads,\r\nwhich he storeth up aqainst the time of his death and buriall. Here also\r\nis his store of red paint for oyntment, bowes and arrowes, Targets and\r\nclubs. This house is fiftie or sixtie yards in length, frequented onely by\r\nPriests. At the foure corners [II.38.] of this house stand foure Images as\r\nSentinels, one of a Dragon, another a Beare, the third like a Leopard, and\r\nthe fourth like a giantlike man, all made evill favouredly, according to\r\ntheir best workemanship.\r\n\r\n                         _His wives._\r\n\r\n                    _His successors._ {MN}\r\n\r\nHe hath as many women as he will, whereof when he lieth on his bed, one\r\nsitteth at his head, and another at his feet, but when he sitteth, one\r\nsitteth on his right hand and another on his left. As he is weary of his\r\nwomen, he bestoweth them on those that best deserve them at his hands.\r\nWhen he dineth or suppeth, one of his women before and after meat,\r\nbringeth him water in a wooden platter to wash his hands. Another waiteth\r\nwith a bunch of feathers to wipe them in stead of a Towell, and the\r\nfeathers when he hath wiped are dryed againe. {MN} His kingdomes descend\r\nnot to his sonnes nor children, but first to his brethren, whereof he hath\r\n3. namely, Opitchapan, Opechancanough, and Catataugh, and after their\r\ndecease to his sisters. First to the eldest sister, then to the rest, and\r\nafter them to the heires male or female of the eldest sister, but never to\r\nthe heires of the males.\r\n\r\n                    _Their authoritie._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                 _The tenor of their lands._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\n                 _His manner of punishments._ {MN-3}\r\n\r\nHe nor any of his people understand any letters, whereby to write or\r\nreade, onely the lawes whereby he ruleth is custome. {MN-1} Yet when he\r\nlisteth his will is a law and must be obeyed: not onely as a King, but as\r\nhalfe a God they esteeme him. His inferiour Kings whom they call\r\nWerowances, are tyed to rule by customes, and have power of life and death\r\nat their command in that nature. But this word Werowance, which we call\r\nand construe for a King, is a common word, whereby they call all\r\ncommanders: for they have but few words in their language, and but few\r\noccasions to use any officers more then one commander, which commonly they\r\ncall Werowance, or Caucorouse, which is Captaine. {MN-2} They all know\r\ntheir severall lands, and habitations, and limits, to fish, foule, or hunt\r\nin, but they hold all of their great their lands. Werrowance Powhatan,\r\nunto whom they pay tribute of skinnes, beads, copper, pearle, deere,\r\nturkies, wild beasts, and corne. What he commandeth they dare not disobey\r\nin the least thing. It is strange to see with what great feare and\r\nadoration, all these people doe obey this Powhatan. For at his feet they\r\npresent whatsoever he commandeth, and at the least frowne of his brow,\r\ntheir greatest spirits will tremble with feare: and no marvell, for he is\r\nvery terrible & tyrannous in punishing such as offend him. {MN-3} For\r\nexample, he caused certaine malefactors to be bound hand and foot, then\r\nhaving of many fires gathered great store of burning coales, they rake\r\nthese coales round in the forme of a cockpit, and in the midst they cast\r\nthe offenders to broyle to death. Sometimes he causeth the heads of them\r\nthat offend him, to be laid upon the altar or sacrificing stone, and one\r\nwith clubbes beats out their braines. When he would punish any notorious\r\nenemy or malefactor, he causeth him to be tyed to a tree, and with Mussell\r\nshels or reeds, the executioner cutteth off his joynts one after another,\r\never casting what they cut of into the fire; then doth he proceed with\r\nshels and reeds to case the skinne from his head and face; then doe they\r\nrip his belly and so burne him with the tree and all. Thus themselves\r\nreported they executed George Cassen. Their ordinary correction is to\r\nbeate them with cudgels. We have seene a man kneeling on his knees, and at\r\nPowhatans command, two men have beate him on the bare skin, till he hath\r\nfallen senselesse in a sound, and yet never cry nor complained. And he\r\nmade a woman for playing the whore, sit upon a great stone, on her bare\r\nbreech twenty-foure houres, onely with corne and water, every three dayes,\r\ntill nine dayes were past, yet he loved her exceedingly: notwithstanding\r\nthere are common whores by profession.\r\n\r\nIn the yeare 1608, he surprised the people of Payankatank his neare\r\nneighbours and subjects. The occasion was to us unknowne, but the manner\r\nwas thus. First he sent divers of his men as to lodge amongst them that\r\nnight, then the Ambuscadoes environed all their houses, and at the houre\r\nappointed, they all fell to the spoyle, twenty-foure men they slew, the\r\nlong haire of the one side of their heads, with the skinne cased off with\r\nshels or reeds, they brought away. They surprised also the women, and the\r\nchildren, and the Werowance. All these they presented to Powhatan. The\r\nWerowance, women and children became his prisoners, and doe him service.\r\n[II.39.] The lockes of haire with their skinnes he hanged on a line\r\nbetwixt two trees. And thus he made ostentation of his triumph at\r\nWerowocomoco, where he intended to have done as much to mee and my\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nAnd this is as much as my memory can call to minde worthy of note; which\r\nI have purposely collected, to satisfie my friends of the true worth and\r\nqualitie of Virginia. Yet some bad natures will not sticke to slander\r\nthe Countrey, that will slovenly spit at all things, especially in company\r\nwhere they can finde none to contradict them. Who though they were scarce\r\never ten myles from James Towne, or at the most but at the falles; yet\r\nholding it a great disgrace that amongst so much action, their actions\r\nwere nothing, exclaime of all things, though they never adventured to know\r\nany thing; nor ever did any thing but devoure the fruits of other mens\r\nlabours. Being for most part of such tender educations, and small\r\nexperience in Martiall accidents, because they found not English Cities,\r\nnor such faire houses, nor at their owne wishes any of their accustomed\r\ndainties, with feather beds and downe pillowes, Tavernes and Alehouses in\r\nevery breathing place, neither such plentie of gold and silver and\r\ndissolute libertie, as they expected, had little or no care of any thing,\r\nbut to pamper their bellies, to fly away with our Pinnaces, or procure\r\ntheir meanes to returne for England. For the Country was to them a misery,\r\na ruine, a death, a hell, and their reports here, and their actions there\r\naccording.\r\n\r\nSome other there were that had yearely stipends to passe to and againe for\r\ntransportation: who to keepe the mysterie of the businesse in themselves,\r\nthough they had neither time nor meanes to know much of themselves; yet\r\nall mens actions or relations they so formally tuned to the temporizing\r\ntimes simplicitie, as they could make their ignorances seeme much more,\r\nthen all the true actors could by their experience. And those with their\r\ngreat words deluded the world with such strange promises, as abused the\r\nbusinesse much worse then the rest. For the businesse being builded upon\r\nthe foundation of their fained experience, the planters, the money and\r\nmeanes have still miscarried: yet they ever returning, and the planters so\r\nfarre absent, who could contradict their excuses? which, still to\r\nmaintaine their vaine glory and estimation, from time to time have used\r\nsuch diligence as made them passe for truths, though nothing more false.\r\nAnd that the adventurers might be thus abused, let no man wonder; for the\r\nwisest living is soonest abused by him that hath a faire tongue and a\r\ndissembling heart.\r\n\r\nThere were many in Virginia meerely projecting, verball, and idle\r\ncontemplators, and those so devoted to pure idlenesse, that though they\r\nhad lived two or three yeares in Virginia, lordly, necessitie it selfe\r\ncould not compell them to passe the Peninsula, or Pallisadoes of James\r\nTowne, and those witty spirits, what would they not affirme in the behalfe\r\nof our transporters, to get victuall from their ships, or obtaine their\r\ngood words in England, to get their passes. Thus from the clamors, and the\r\nignorance of false informers, are sprung those disasters that sprung in\r\nVirginia: and our ingenious verbalists were no lesse plague to us in\r\nVirginia, then the Locusts to the Egyptians. For the labour of twentie\r\nor thirtie of the best onely preserved in Christianitie by their industry\r\nthe idle livers of neare two hundred of the rest: who living neere ten\r\nmoneths of such naturall meanes, as the Country naturally of it selfe\r\nafforded, notwithstanding all this, and the worst fury of the Salvages,\r\nthe extremitie of sicknesse, mutinies, faction, ignorances, and want of\r\nvictuall; in all that time I lost but seaven or eight men, yet subjected\r\nthe salvages to our desired obedience, and received contribution from\r\nthirtie five of their Kings, to protect and assist them against any that\r\nshould assault them, in which order they continued true and faithfull, and\r\nas subjects to his Majestie, so long after as I did governe there, untill\r\nI left the Countrey: since, how they have revolted, the Countrie lost, and\r\nagaine replanted, and the businesses hath succeded from time to time, I\r\nreferre you to the relations of them returned from Virginia, that have\r\nbeene more diligent in such Observations.\r\n\r\n            John Smith writ this with his owne hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        [II.40.] Because many doe desire to know the manner of their\r\n            Language, I have inserted these few words.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ka katorawinos yowo, What call you this.\r\n    Nemarough, a man.\r\n    Grenepo, a woman.\r\n    Marowanchesso, a boy.\r\n    Yehawkans, Houses.\r\n    Matchcores, Skins, or garments.\r\n    Mockasins, Shooes.\r\n    Tussan, Beds.\r\n    Pokatawer, Fire.\r\n    Attawp, A bow.\r\n    Attonce, Arrowes.\r\n    Monacookes, Swords.\r\n    Aumouhhowgh, A Target.\r\n    Pawcussacks, Gunnes.\r\n    Tomahacks, Axes.\r\n    Tockahacks, Pickaxes.\r\n    Pamesacks, Knives.\r\n    Accowprets, Sheares.\r\n    Pawpecones, Pipes.\r\n    Mattassin, Copper.\r\n    Ussawassin, Iron, Brass,\r\n     Silver, or any white mettall.\r\n    Musses, Woods.\r\n    Attasskuss, Leaves, weeds,\r\n     or grasse.\r\n    Chepsin, Land.\r\n    Shacquohocan, A stone.\r\n    Wepenter, A cookold.\r\n    Suckahanna, Water.\r\n    Noughmass, Fish.\r\n    Copotone, Sturgeon.\r\n    Weghshaughes, Flesh.\r\n    Sawwehone, Bloud.\r\n    Netoppew, Friends.\r\n    Marrapough, Enemies.\r\n    Maskapow, the worst of the enemies.\r\n    Mawchick chammay, The best of friends.\r\n    Casacunnakack, peya quagh acquintan\r\n     uttasantasough, In how many daies\r\n     will there come hither any more\r\n     English Ships.\r\n\r\n    Their Numbers.\r\n    Necut, 1.

But because all the world doe see a defailement;\r\nthis following Treatise shall give satisfaction to all indifferent\r\nReaders, how the businesse hath bin carried: where no doubt they will\r\neasily understand and answer to their question, how it came to passe there\r\nwas no better speed and successe in those proceedings.\r\n\r\n                   _The first mover of the action._\r\n\r\n                       _Orders for government._ {MN}\r\n\r\nCaptaine Bartholomew Gosnoll, one of the first movers of this plantation,\r\nhaving many yeares solicited many of his friends, but found small\r\nassistants; at last prevailed with some Gentlemen, as Captaine John Smith,\r\nMr. Edward-maria Wingfield, Mr. Robert Hunt, and divers others, who\r\ndepended a yeare upon his projects, but nothing could be effected, till by\r\ntheir great charge and industrie, it came to be apprehended by certaine of\r\nthe Nobilitie, Gentry, and Marchants, so that his Majestie by his letters\r\npatents, gave commission for establishing Councels, to direct here; and to\r\ngoverne, and to execute there. To effect this, was spent another yeare,\r\nand by that, three ships were provided, one of 100 Tuns, another of 40.\r\nand a Pinnace of 20. The transportation of the company was committed to\r\nCaptaine Christopher Newport, a Marriner well practised for the Westerne\r\nparts of America. {MN} But their orders for government were put in a box,\r\nnot to be opened, nor the governours knowne untill they arrived in\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nOn the 19 of December, 1606. we set sayle from Blackwall, but by\r\nunprosperous winds, were kept six weekes in the sight of England; all\r\nwhich time, Mr. Hunt our Preacher, was so weake and sicke, that few\r\nexpected his recovery. Yet although he were but twentie myles from his\r\nhabitation (the time we were in the Downes) and notwithstanding the stormy\r\nweather, nor the scandalous imputations (of some few, little better then\r\nAtheists, of the greatest ranke amongst us) suggested against him, all\r\nthis could never force from him so much as a seeming desire to leave the\r\nbusines, but preferred the service of God, in so good a voyage, before any\r\naffection to contest with his godlesse foes, whose disasterous [III.42.]\r\ndesignes (could they have prevailed) had even then overthrowne the\r\nbusinesse, so many discontents did then arise, had he not with the water\r\nof patience, and his godly exhortations (but chiefly by his true devoted\r\nexamples) quenched those flames of envie, and dissention.\r\n\r\n                             A.D. 1607.\r\n\r\n         _Monica an unfrequented Isle full of Birds._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                 _Their first landing._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\n                _Matters of government._ {MN-3}\r\n\r\nWe watered at the Canaries, we traded with the Salvages at Dominica; three\r\nweekes we spent in refreshing our selves amongst these west-India Isles;\r\nin Gwardalupa we found a bath so hot, as in it we boyled Porck as well\r\nas over the fire. {MN-1} And at a little Isle called Monica, we tooke from\r\nthe bushes with our hands, neare two hogs-heads full of Birds in three or\r\nfoure houres. In Mevis, Mona, and the Virgin Isles, we spent some time,\r\nwhere, with a lothsome beast like a Crocodil, called a Gwayn, Tortoises,\r\nPellicans, Parrots, and fishes, we daily feasted. Gone from thence in\r\nsearch of Virginia, the company was not a little discomforted, seeing the\r\nMarriners had 3 dayes passed their reckoning and found no land, so that\r\nCaptaine Ratliffe (Captaine of the Pinnace) rather desired to beare up the\r\nhelme to returne for England, then make further search. But God the guider\r\nof all good actions, forcing them by an extreame storme to hull all night,\r\ndid drive them by his providence to their desired Port, beyond all their\r\nexpectations, for never any of them had seene that coast. {MN-2} The first\r\nland they made they called Cape Henry; where thirtie of them recreating\r\nthemselves on shore, were assaulted by five Salvages, who hurt two of the\r\nEnglish very dangerously. That night was the box opened, and the orders\r\nread, in which Bartholomew Gosnoll, John Smith, Edward Wingfield,\r\nChristopher Newport, John Ratliffe, John Martin, and George Kendall, were\r\nnamed to be the Councell, and to choose a President amongst them for a\r\nyeare, who with the Councell should governe. {MN-3} Matters of moment were\r\nto be examined by a Jury, but determined by the major part of the\r\nCouncell, in which the President had two voyces. Untill the 13 of May they\r\nsought a place to plant in, then the Councell was sworne, Mr. Wingfield\r\nwas chosen President, and an Oration made, why Captaine Smith was not\r\nadmitted of the Councell as the rest.\r\n\r\n          _The discovery of the Falles & Powhatan._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n               _The Fort assaulted by Salvages._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nNow falleth every man to worke, the Councell contrive the Fort, the rest\r\ncut downe trees to make place to pitch their Tents; some provide clapbord\r\nto relade the ships, some make gardens, some nets, &c. The Salvages often\r\nvisited us kindly. The Presidents overweening jealousie would admit no\r\nexercise at armes, or fortification, but the boughs of trees cast together\r\nin the forme of a halfe moone by the extraordinary paines and diligence of\r\nCaptaine Kendall, Newport, Smith, and twentie others, were sent to\r\ndiscover the head of the river: {MN-1} by divers small habitations they\r\npassed, in six dayes they arrived at a Towne called Powhatan, consisting\r\nof some twelve houses, pleasantly seated on a hill; before it three\r\nfertile Isles, about it many of their cornefields, the place is very\r\npleasant, and strong by nature, of this place the Prince is called\r\nPowhatan, and his people Powhatans, to this place the river is navigable:\r\nbut higher within a myle, by reason of the Rockes and Isles, there is not\r\npassage for a small Boat, this they call the Falles, the people in all\r\nparts kindly intreated them, till being returned within twentie myles of\r\nJames towne, they gave just cause of jealousie, but had God not blessed\r\nthe discoverers otherwise then those at the Fort, there had then beene an\r\nend of that plantation; {MN-2} for at the Fort, where they arrived the\r\nnext day, they found 17 men hurt, and a boy slaine by the Salvages, and\r\nhad it not chanced a crosse barre shot from the Ships strooke down a bough\r\nfrom a tree amongst them, that caused them to retire, our men had all\r\nbeene slaine, being securely all at worke, and their armes in dry fats.\r\n\r\n                   Captain Smith Reinstated\r\n\r\n           _Captain Newports return for England._ {MN}\r\n\r\nHereupon the President was contented the Fort should be pallisadoed, the\r\nOrdnance mounted, his men armed and exercised, for many were the assaults,\r\nand ambuscadoes of the Salvages; & our men by their disorderly stragling\r\nwere often hurt, when the Salvages by the nimblenesse of their heeles well\r\nescaped. What toyle we had, with so small a power to guard our workemen\r\nadayes, watch all night, resist our enemies, and effect our businesse, to\r\nrelade the ships, cut downe trees, and prepare the ground to plant our\r\nCorne, &c, I referre to the Readers consideration. Six weekes being spent\r\nin this manner, Captaine Newport (who was hired onely for our [III.43.]\r\ntransportation) was to return with the ships. Now Captaine Smith who all\r\nthis time from their departure from the Canaries was restrained as a\r\nprisoner upon the scandalous suggestions of some of the chiefe (envying\r\nhis repute) who fained he intended to usurpe the government, murther the\r\nCouncell, and make himselfe King, that his confederats were dispersed in\r\nall the three ships, and that divers of his confederats that revealed it,\r\nwould affirme it, for this he was committed as a prisoner: thirteene\r\nweekes he remained thus suspected, and by that time the ships should\r\nreturne they pretended out of their commisserations, to referre him to the\r\nCouncell in England to receive a check, rather then by particulating his\r\ndesignes make him so odious to the world, as to touch his life, or utterly\r\noverthrow his reputation. But he so much scorned their charitie, and\r\npublikely defied the uttermost of their crueltie, he wisely prevented\r\ntheir policies, though he could not suppresse their envies, yet so well he\r\ndemeaned himselfe in this businesse, as all the company did see his\r\ninnocency, and his adversaries malice, and those suborned to accuse him,\r\naccused his accusers of subornation; many untruthes were alledged against\r\nhim; but being so apparently disproved, begat a generall hatred in the\r\nhearts of the company against such unjust Commanders, that the President\r\nwas adjudged to give him 200 L. so that all he had was seized upon, in part\r\nof satisfaction, which Smith presently returned to the Store for the\r\ngenerall use of the Colony. Many were the mischiefes that daily sprung\r\nfrom their ignorant (yet ambitious) spirits; but the good Doctrine and\r\nexhortation of our Preacher Mr. Hunt reconciled them, and caused Captaine\r\nSmith to be admitted of the Councell; the next day all received the\r\nCommunion, the day following the Salvages voluntarily desired peace, {MN}\r\nand Captaine Newport returned for England with newes; leaving in Virginia\r\n100. the 15 of June 1607.\r\n\r\n               By this observe;\r\n    Good men did ne'r their Countries ruine bring.\r\n    But when evill men shall injuries beginne;\r\n    Not caring to corrupt and violate\r\n    The judgements-seats for their owne Lucr's sakes\r\n    Then looke that Country cannot long have peace,\r\n    Though for the present it have rest and ease.\r\n\r\n                   THE FIRST COLONISTS\r\n\r\n                           A.D. 1607.\r\n                   _Sir Thomas Smith Treasurer._\r\n\r\n          The names of them that were the first Planters,\r\n                 were these following.\r\n\r\n                         Councel.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Edward Maria         Captaine John Smith.\r\n      Wingfield.

II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                What happened till the first supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _The occasion of sickness._\r\n\r\n                      _The sailors abuses._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                        _A bad President._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\n                      _Plentie unexpected._ {MN-3}\r\n\r\nBeing thus left to our fortunes, it fortuned that within ten dayes scarce\r\nten amongst us could either goe, or well stand, such extreame weaknes and\r\nsicknes oppressed us. And thereat none need marvaile, if they consider the\r\ncause and reason, which was this; whilest the ships stayed, our allowance\r\nwas somewhat bettered, by a daily proportion of Bisket, {MN-1} which the\r\nsailers would pilfer to sell, give, or exchange with us, for money,\r\nSaxefras, furres, or love. But when they departed, there remained neither\r\ntaverne, beere house, nor place of reliefe, but the common Kettell. Had we\r\nbeene as free from all sinnes as gluttony, and drunkennesse, we might have\r\nbeene canonized for Saints; But our President would never have beene\r\nadmitted, for ingrossing to his private, Oatmeale, Sacke, Oyle, Aquavitae,\r\nBeefe, Egges, or what not, but the Kettell; that indeed he allowed equally\r\nto be distributed, and that was halfe a pint of wheat, and as much barley\r\nboyled with water for a man a day, and this having fryed some 26. weekes\r\nin the ships hold, contained as many wormes as graines; so that we might\r\ntruely call it rather so much bran then corne, our drinke was water, our\r\nlodgings Castles in the ayre: with this lodging and dyet, our extreame\r\ntoile in bearing and planting Pallisadoes, so strained and bruised us, and\r\nour continuall labour in the extremitie of the heat had so weakned us, as\r\nwere cause sufficient to have made us as miserable in our native Countrey,\r\nor any other place in the world. From May, to September, those that\r\nescaped, lived upon Sturgeon, and Sea-crabs, fiftie in this time we\r\nburied, {MN-2} the rest seeing the Presidents projects to escape these\r\nmiseries in our Pinnace by flight (who all this time had neither felt want\r\nnor sicknes) so moved our dead spirits, as we deposed him; and established\r\nRatcliffe in his place, (Gosnoll being dead) Kendall deposed, Smith newly\r\nrecovered, Martin and Ratcliffe was by his care preserved and relieved,\r\nand the most of the souldiers recovered, with the skilfull diligence of Mr.\r\nThomas Wotton our Chirurgian generall. But now was all our provision\r\nspent, the Sturgeon gone, all helps abandoned, each houre expecting the\r\nfury of the Salvages; {MN-3} when God the patron of all good indevours, in\r\nthat desperate extremitie so changed the hearts of the Salvages, that they\r\nbrought such plenty of their fruits, and provision, as no man wanted.\r\n\r\nAnd now where some affirmed it was ill done of the Councell to send forth\r\nmen so badly provided, this incontradictable reason will shew them\r\nplainely they are too ill advised to nourish such ill conceits; first, the\r\nfault [III.45.] of our going was our owne, what could be thought fitting\r\nor necessary we had, but what we should find, or want, or where we should\r\nbe, we were all ignorant, and supposing to make our passage in two moneths,\r\nwith victuall to live, and the advantage of the spring to worke; we were at\r\nSea five moneths, where we both spent our victuall and lost the\r\nopportunitie of the time, and season to plant, by the unskilfull\r\npresumption of our ignorant transporters, that understood not at all, what\r\nthey undertooke.\r\n\r\nSuch actions have ever since the worlds beginning beene subject to such\r\naccidents, and every thing of worth is found full of difficulties, but\r\nnothing so difficult as to establish a Common wealth so farre remote from\r\nmen and meanes, and where mens mindes are so untoward as neither doe well\r\nthemselves, nor suffer others. But to proceed.\r\n\r\n               _The building of James Towne._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n              _The beginning of Trade abroad._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nThe new President and Martin, being little beloved, of weake judgement in\r\ndangers, and lesse industrie in peace, committed the managing of all\r\nthings abroad to Captaine Smith: {MN-1} who by his owne example, good\r\nwords, and faire promises, set some to mow, others to binde thatch, some\r\nto build houses, others to thatch them, himselfe alwayes bearing the\r\ngreatest taske for his owne share, so that in short time, he provided most\r\nof them lodgings, neglecting any for himselfe. This done, seeing the\r\nSalvages superfluitie beginne to decrease (with some of his workemen)\r\nshipped himselfe in the Shallop to search the Country for trade. The want\r\nof the language, knowledge to mannage his boat without sailes, the want of\r\na sufficient power, (knowing the multitude of the Salvages) apparell for\r\nhis men, and other necessaries, were infinite impediments, yet no\r\ndiscouragement. {MN-2} Being but six or seaven in company he went downe\r\nthe river to Kecoughtan, where at first they scorned him, as a tarnished\r\nman, and would in derision offer him a handfull of Corne, a peece of\r\nbread, for their swords and muskets, and such like proportions also for\r\ntheir apparell. But seeing by trade and courtesie there was nothing to be\r\nhad, he made bold to try such conclusions as necessitie inforced, though\r\ncontrary to his Commission: Let fly his muskets, ran his boat on shore,\r\nwhereat they all fled into the woods. So marching towards their houses,\r\nthey might see great heapes of corne: much adoe he had to restraine his\r\nhungry souldiers from present taking of it, expecting as it hapned that\r\nthe Salvages would assault them, as not long after they did with a most\r\nhydeous noyse. Sixtie or seaventie of them, some blacke, some red, some\r\nwhite, some party-coloured, came in a square order, singing and dauncing\r\nout of the woods, with their Okee (which was an Idoll made of skinnes,\r\nstuffed with mosse, all painted and hung with chaines and copper) borne\r\nbefore them: and in this manner being well armed, with Clubs, Targets,\r\nBowes and Arrowes, they charged the English, that so kindly received them\r\nwith their muskets loaden with Pistoll shot, that downe fell their God,\r\nand divers lay sprauling on the ground; the rest fled againe to the woods,\r\nand ere long sent one of their Quiyoughkasoucks to offer peace, and\r\nredeeme their Okee. Smith told them, if onely six of them would come\r\nunarmed and loade his boat, he would not only be their friend, but restore\r\nthem their Okee, and give them Beads, Copper, and Hatchets besides: which\r\non both sides was to their contents performed: and then they brought him\r\nVenison, Turkies, wild foule, bread, and what they had, singing and\r\ndauncing in signe of friendship till they departed. In his returne he\r\ndiscovered the Towne and Country of Warraskoyack.\r\n\r\n           Thus God unboundlesse by his power,\r\n           Made them thus kind, would us devour.\r\n\r\n        _Amoris, a Salvage his best friend slaine for loving us.\r\n               The discovery of Chickahamine._\r\n\r\n           _Another project to abandon the country._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n            _John Robinson and Thomas Emry slaine._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nSmith perceiving (notwithstanding their late miserie) not any regarded but\r\nfrom hand to mouth (the company being well recovered) caused the Pinnace\r\nto be provided with things fitting to get provision for the yeare\r\nfollowing; but in the interim he made 3. or 4. journies and discovered\r\nthe people of Chickahamania: yet what he carefully provided the rest\r\ncarelessly spent. Wingfield and Kendall living in disgrace, seeing all\r\nthings at randome in the [III.46.] absence of Smith, the companies\r\ndislike of their Presidents weaknes, and their small love to Martins never\r\nmending sicknes, strengthened themselves with the sailers, and other\r\nconfederates to regaine their former credit and authority, or at least\r\nsuch meanes abord the Pinnace, (being fitted to saile as Smith had\r\nappointed for trade) to alter her course and to goe for England. Smith\r\nunexpectedly returning had the plot discovered to him, much trouble he had\r\nto prevent it, till with store of sakre and musket shot he forced them\r\nstay or sinke in the river, which action cost the life of captaine\r\nKendall. These brawles are so disgustfull, as some will say they were\r\nbetter forgotten, yet all men of good judgement will conclude, it were\r\nbetter their basenes should be manifest to the world, then the busines\r\nbeare the scorne and shame of their excused disorders. The President and\r\ncaptaine Archer not long after intended also to have abandoned the\r\ncountry, which project also was curbed, and suppressed by Smith. {MN-1}\r\nThe Spaniard never more greedily desired gold then he victuall, nor his\r\nsouldiers more to abandon the Country, then he to keepe it. But finding\r\nplentie of Corne in the river of Chickahamania where hundreds of Salvages\r\nin divers places stood with baskets expecting his comming. And now the\r\nwinter approaching, the rivers became so covered with swans, geese,\r\nduckes, and cranes, that we daily feasted with good bread, Virginia pease,\r\npumpions, and putchamins, fish, fowle, and diverse sorts of wild beasts as\r\nfar as we could eate them: so that none of our Tuftaffaty humorists\r\ndesired to goe for England. But our Comaedies never endured long without a\r\nTragedie; some idle exceptions being muttered against Captaine Smith, for\r\nnot discovering the head of Chickahamania river, and taxed by the\r\nCouncell, to be too slow in so worthy an attempt. The next voyage hee\r\nproceeded so farre that with much labour by cutting of trees in sunder he\r\nmade his passage, but when his Barge could passe no farther, he left her\r\nin a broad bay out of danger of shot, commanding none should goe a shore\r\ntill his returne: himselfe with two English and two Salvages went up\r\nhigher in a Canowe, but hee was not long absent, but his men went a shore,\r\nwhose want of government, gave both occasion and opportunity to the\r\nSalvages to surprise one George Cassen, whom they slew, and much failed\r\nnot to have cut of the boat and all the rest. {MN-2} Smith little dreaming\r\nof that accident, being got to the marshes at the rivers head, twentie\r\nmyles in the desert, had his two men slaine (as is supposed) sleeping by\r\nthe Canowe, whilst himselfe by fowling sought them victuall, who finding\r\nhe was beset with 200. Salvages, two of them hee slew, still defending\r\nhimselfe with the ayd of a Salvage his guid, whom he bound to his arme\r\nwith his garters, and used him as a buckler, yet he was shot in his thigh\r\na little, and had many arrowes that stucke in his cloathes but no great\r\nhurt, till at last they tooke him prisoner. When this newes came to James\r\ntowne, much was their sorrow for his losse, fewe expecting what ensued.\r\nSixe or seven weekes those Barbarians kept him prisoner, many strange\r\ntriumphes and conjurations they made of him, yet hee so demeaned himselfe\r\namongst them, as he not onely diverted them from surprising the Fort, but\r\nprocured his owne libertie, and got himselfe and his company such\r\nestimation amongst them, that those Salvages admired him more then their\r\nowne Quiyouckosucks. The manner how they used and delivered him is as\r\nfolloweth.\r\n\r\n                  _Captaine Smith taken prisoner._\r\n\r\nThe Salvages having drawne from George Cassen whether Captaine Smith was\r\ngone, prosecuting that opportunity they followed him with 300. bowmen,\r\nconducted by the King of Pamaunkee, who in divisions searching the\r\nturnings of the river, found Robinson and Emry by the fire side; those\r\nthey shot full of arrowes and slew. Then finding the Captaine, as is said,\r\nthat used the Salvage that was his guide as his shield (three of them\r\nbeing slaine and divers other so gauld) all the rest would not come neere\r\nhim. Thinking thus to have returned to his boat, regarding them, as he\r\nmarched, more then his way, slipped up to the middle in an oasie creeke &\r\nhis Salvage with him, yet durst they not come to him till, being neere\r\ndead with cold, he threw away his armes. Then according to their\r\ncomposition they drew him forth and led him to the fire, where his men\r\nwere slaine. [III. 47.] Diligently they chafed his benummed limbs. He\r\ndemanding for their Captaine, they shewed him Opechankanough, King of\r\nPamaunkee, to whom he gave a round Ivory double compass Dyall. Much they\r\nmarvailed at the playing of the Fly and Needle, which they could see so\r\nplainely, and yet not touch it, because of the glasse that covered them.\r\nBut when he demonstrated by that Globe-like Jewell, the roundnesse of the\r\nearth, and skies, the spheare of the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, and how\r\nthe Sunne did chase the night round about the world continually; the\r\ngreatnesse of the Land and Sea, the diversitie of Nations, varietie of\r\ncomplexions, and how we were to them Antipodes, and many other such like\r\nmatters, they all stood as amazed with admiration. Notwithstanding, within\r\nan houre after they tyed him to a tree, and as many as could stand about\r\nhim prepared to shoot him, but the King holding up the Compass in his\r\nhand, they all laid downe their Bowes and Arrowes, and in a triumphant\r\nmanner led him to Orapaks, where he was after their manner kindly feasted,\r\nand well used.\r\n\r\n             _The order they observed in their triumph._\r\n\r\nTheir order in conducting him was thus; Drawing themselves all in fyle,\r\nthe King in the middest had all their Peeces and swords borne before him.\r\nCaptaine Smith was led after him by three great Salvages, holding him fast\r\nby each arme: and on each side six went in fyle with their Arrowes nocked.\r\nBut arriving at the Towne (which was but onely thirtie or fortie hunting\r\nhouses made of Mats, which they remove as they please, as we our tents)\r\nall the women and children staring to behold him, the souldiers first all\r\nin fyle performed the forme of a Bissom so well as could be, and on each\r\nflanke, officers as Serjeants to see them keepe their orders. A good time\r\nthey continued this exercise, and then cast themselves in a ring, dauncing\r\nin such severall Postures, and singing and yelling out such hellish notes\r\nand screeches; being strangely painted, every one his quiver of Arrowes,\r\nand at his backe a club; on his arme a Fox or an Otters skinne, or some\r\nsuch matter for his vambrace; their heads and shoulders painted red, with\r\nOyle and Pocones mingled together, which Scarlet-like colour made an\r\nexceeding handsome shew; his Bow in his hand, and the skinne of a Bird\r\nwith her wings abroad dryed, tyed on his head, a peece of copper, a white\r\nshell, a long feather, with a small rattle growing at the tayles of their\r\nsnaks tyed to it, or some such like toy. All this while Smith and the\r\nKing stood in the middest guarded, as before is said, and after three\r\ndances they all departed. Smith they conducted to a long house, where\r\nthirtie or fortie tall fellowes did guard him, and ere long more bread and\r\nvenison was brought him then would have served twentie men, I thinke his\r\nstomacke at that time was not very good; what he left they put in baskets\r\nand tyed over his head. About midnight they set the meate againe before\r\nhim, all this time not one of them would eate a bit with him, till the\r\nnext morning they brought him as much more, and then did they eate all the\r\nold, & reserved the new as they had done the other, which made him thinke\r\nthey would fat him to eat him. Yet in this desperate estate to defend him\r\nfrom the cold, one Maocassater brought him his gowne, in requitall of some\r\nbeads and toyes Smith had given him at his first arrivall in Virginia.\r\n\r\n          _How he should have been slaine at Orapacks._\r\n\r\nTwo dayes after a man would have slaine him (but that the guard prevented\r\nit) for the death of his sonne, to whom they conducted him to recover the\r\npoore man then breathing his last. Smith told them that at James towne he\r\nhad a water would doe it, if they would let him fetch it, but they would\r\nnot permit that; but made all the preparations they could to assault James\r\ntowne, craving his advice, and for recompence he should have life,\r\nlibertie, land, and women. In part of a Table booke he writ his minde to\r\nthem at the Fort, what was intended, how they should follow that direction\r\nto affright the messengers, and without fayle send him such things as he\r\nwrit for. And an Inventory with them. The difficultie and danger, he told\r\nthe Salvages, of the Mines, great-gunnes, and other Engins exceedingly\r\naffrighted them, yet according to his request they went to James towne, in\r\nas bitter weather as could be of frost and snow, and within three dayes\r\nreturned with an answer.\r\n\r\n           _How he saved James towne from being surprised._\r\n\r\n            _How they did Conjure him at Pamuankee._ {MN}\r\n\r\nBut when they came to James towne, seeing men sally out as he had told them\r\nthey would, they fled; yet in the night they came againe to the same place\r\nwhere he had told them they should receive an answer, and such things\r\n[III.48] as he had promised them, which they found accordingly, and with\r\nwhich they returned with no small expedition, to the wonder of them all\r\nthat heard it, that he could either divine, or the paper could speake:\r\nthen they led him to the Youthtanunds, the Mattapanients, the\r\nPayankatanks, the Nantaughtacunds, and Onawmanients upon the rivers of\r\nRaphanock, and Patawomek, over all those rivers, and backe againe by\r\ndivers other severall Nations, to the Kings habitation at Pamaunkee, {MN}\r\nwhere they entertained him with most strange and fearefulle Conjurations.\r\n\r\n              As if neare led to hell,\r\n              Amongst the Devils to dwell.\r\n\r\nNot long after, early in a morning a great fire was made in a long house,\r\nand a mat spread on the one side, as on the other; on the one they caused\r\nhim to sit, and all the guard went out of the house, and presently came\r\nskipping in a great grim fellow, all painted over with coale, mingled with\r\noyle; and many Snakes and Wesels skins stuffed with mosse, and all their\r\ntayles tyed together, so as they met on the crowne of his head in a\r\ntassell; and round about the tassell was as a Coronet of feathers, the\r\nskins hanging round about his head, backe, and shoulders, and in a manner\r\ncovered his face; with a hellish voyce and a rattle in his hand. With most\r\nstrange gestures and passions he began his invocation, and environed the\r\nfire with a circle of meale; which done, three more such like devils came\r\nrushing in with the like antique tricks, painted halfe blacke, halfe red:\r\nbut all their eyes were painted white, and some red stroakes like\r\nMutchato's, along their cheekes: round about him those fiends daunced a\r\npretty while, and then came in three more as ugly as the rest; with red\r\neyes, and white stroakes over their blacke faces, at last they all sat\r\ndowne right against him; three of them on the one hand of the chiefe\r\nPriest, and three on the other. Then all with their rattles began a song,\r\nwhich ended, the chiefe Priest layd downe five wheat cornes: then\r\nstrayning his armes and hands with such violence that he sweat, and his\r\nveynes swelled, he began a short Oration: at the conclusion they all gave\r\na short groane; and then layd down three graines more. After that, began\r\ntheir song againe, and then another Oration, ever laying downe so many\r\ncornes as before, till they had twice incirculed the fire; that done, they\r\ntooke a bunch of little stickes prepared for that purpose, continuing\r\nstill their devotion, and at the end of every song and Oration, they layd\r\ndowne a sticke betwixt the divisions of Corne. Till night, neither he nor\r\nthey did either eate or drinke, and then they feasted merrily, with the\r\nbest provisions they could make. Three dayes they used this Ceremony; the\r\nmeaning whereof they told him was to know if he intended them well or no.\r\nThe circle of meale signified their Country, the circles of corne the\r\nbounds of the Sea, and the stickes his Country. They imagined the world to\r\nbe flat and round, like a trencher, and they in the middest. After this\r\nthey brought him a bagge of gunpowder, which they carefully preserved till\r\nthe next spring, to plant as they did their corne; because they would be\r\nacquainted with the nature of that seede.\r\n\r\nOpitchapam the Kings brother invited him to his house, where, with as many\r\nplatters of bread, foule, and wild beasts; as did environ him, he bid him\r\nwellcome; but not any of them would eate a bit with him, but put up all\r\nthe remainder in Baskets. At his returne to Opechancanoughs, all the Kings\r\nwomen, and their children, flocked about him for their parts, as a due by\r\nCustome, to be merry with such fragments.\r\n\r\n    But his waking mind in hydeous dreames did oft see wondrous shapes,\r\n    Of bodies strange, and huge in growth, and of stupendious makes.\r\n\r\n                     _How Powhatan entertained him._\r\n\r\n                   _How Pocahontas saved his life_ {MN}\r\n\r\nAt last they brought him to Meronocomo, where was Powhatan their Emperor.\r\nHere more then two hundred of those grim Courtiers stood wondering at him,\r\nas he had beene a monster; till Powhatan and his trayne had put themselves\r\nin their greatest braveries. Before a fire upon a seat like a bedsted, he\r\nsat covered with a great robe, made of Rarowcun skinnes, and all the\r\ntayles hanging by. On either hand did sit a young wench of 16 or 18\r\nyeares, and along on each side the house, two rowes of [III.49] men, and\r\nbehind them as many women, with all their heads and shoulders painted red;\r\nmany of their heads bedecked with the white downe of Birds; but every one\r\nwith something: and a great chayne of white beads about their necks. At\r\nhis entrance before the King, all the people gave a great shout. The\r\nQueene of Appamatuck was appointed to bring him water to wash his hands,\r\nand another brought him a bunch of feathers, in stead of a Towell to dry\r\nthem; having feasted him after their best barbarous manner they could, a\r\nlong consultation was held, but the conclusion was, two great stones were\r\nbrought before Powhatan: then as many as could layd hands on him, dragged\r\nhim to them, and thereon laid his head, and being ready with their clubs,\r\nto beate out his braines, {MN} Pocahontas the Kings dearest daughter, when\r\nno intreaty could prevaile, got his head in her armes, and laid her owne\r\nupon his to save him from death: whereat the Emperour was contented he\r\nshould live to make him hatchets, and her bells, beads, and copper; for\r\nthey thought him as well of all occupations as themselves. For the King\r\nhimselfe will make his owne robes, shooes, bowes, arrowes, pots; plant,\r\nhunt, or doe any thing so well as the rest.\r\n\r\n    They say he bore a pleasant shew,\r\n    But sure his heart was sad.\r\n    For who can pleasant be, and rest,\r\n    That lives in feare and dread:\r\n    And having life suspected, doth\r\n    It still suspected lead.\r\n\r\n\r\n               _How Powhatan sent him to James Towne._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n            _The third project to abandon the Countrey._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nTwo dayes after, Powhatan having disguised himselfe in the most fearefull\r\nmanner he could, caused Capt. Smith to be brought forth to a great house\r\nin the woods, and there upon a mat by the fire to be left alone. {MN-1}\r\nNot long after from behinde a mat that divided the house, was made the\r\nmost dolefullest noyse he ever heard; then Powhatan more like a devill\r\nthen a man with some two hundred more as blacke as himselfe, came unto him\r\nand told him now they were friends, and presently he should goe to James\r\ntowne, to send him two great gunnes, and a grynd-stone, for which he would\r\ngive him the Country of Capahowosick, and for ever esteeme him as his\r\nsonne Nantaquoud. So to James towne with 12 guides Powhatan sent him. That\r\nnight they quarterd in the woods, he still expecting (as he had done all\r\nthis long time of his imprisonment) every houre to be put to one death or\r\nother: for all their feasting. But almightie God (by his divine\r\nprovidence) had mollified the hearts of those sterne Barbarians with\r\ncompassion. The next morning betimes they came to the Fort, where Smith\r\nhaving used the Salvages with what kindnesse he could, he shewed Rawhunt,\r\nPowhatans trusty servant two demi-Culverings & a millstone to carry\r\nPowhatan: they found them some-what too heavie; but when they did see him\r\ndischarge them, being loaded with stones, among the boughs of a great tree\r\nloaded with Isickles, the yce and branches came so tumbling downe, that\r\nthe poore Salvages ran away halfe dead with feare. But at last we regained\r\nsome conference with them, and gave them such toyes; and sent to Powhatan,\r\nhis women, and children such presents, as gave them in generall full\r\ncontent. {MN-2} Now in James Towne they were all in combustion, the\r\nstrongest preparing once more to run away with the Pinnace; which with the\r\nhazzard of his life, with Sakre falcon and musket shot, Smith forced now\r\nthe third time to stay or sinke. Some no better then they should be, had\r\nplotted with the President, the next day to have put him to death by the\r\nLeviticall law, for the lives of Robinson and Emry, pretending the fault\r\nwas his that had led them to their ends: but he quickly tooke such order\r\nwith such Lawyers, that he layd them by the heeles till he sent some of\r\nthem prisoners for England. Now ever once in foure or five dayes,\r\nPocahontas with her attendants, brought him so much provision, that saved\r\nmany of their lives, that els for all this had starved with hunger.\r\n\r\n    Thus from numbe death our good God sent reliefe,\r\n    The sweete asswager of all other griefe.\r\n\r\n\r\n         _A true proofe of Gods love to the action._\r\n\r\n\r\nHis relation of the plenty he had seene, especially at Werawocomoco,\r\n[III.50.] and of the state and bountie of Powhatan, (which till that time\r\nwas unknowne) so revived their dead spirits (especially the love of\r\nPocahontas) as all mens feare was abandoned. Thus you may see what\r\ndifficulties still crossed any good indevour: and the good successe of the\r\nbusinesse being thus oft brought to the very period of destruction; yet\r\nyou see by what strange means God hath still delivered it. As for the\r\ninsufficiency of them admitted in Commission, that error could not be\r\nprevented by the Electors; there being no other choise, and all strangers\r\nto each others education, qualities, or disposition. And if any deeme it a\r\nshame to our Nation to have any mention made of those inormities, let them\r\nperuse the Histories of the Spanyards Discoveries and Plantations, where\r\nthey may see how many mutinies, disorders, and dissentions have\r\naccompanied them, and crossed their attempts: which being knowne to be\r\nparticular mens offences; doth take away the generall scorne and contempt,\r\nwhich malice, presumption, covetousnesse, or ignorance might produce; to\r\nthe scandall and reproach of those, whose actions and valiant resolutions\r\ndeserve a more worthy respect.\r\n\r\n               _Of two evils the lesse was chosen._ {MN}\r\n\r\nNow whether it had beene better for Captaine Smith, to have concluded with\r\nany of those severall projects, to have abandoned the Countrey, with some\r\nten or twelve of them, who were called the better sort, and have left Mr.\r\nHunt our Preacher, Master Anthony Gosnoll, a most honest, worthy, and\r\nindustrious Gentleman, Master Thomas Wotton, and some 27 others of his\r\nCountrymen to the fury of the Salvages, famine, and all manner of\r\nmischiefes, and inconveniences, (for they were but fortie in all to keepe\r\npossession of this large Country;) or {MN} starve himselfe with them for\r\ncompany, for want of lodging: or but adventuring abroad to make them\r\nprovision, or by his opposition to preserve the action, and save all their\r\nlives; I leave to the censure of all honest men to consider. But\r\n\r\n    We men imagine in our Jolitie,\r\n    That 'tis all one, or good or bad to be.\r\n    But then anone wee alter this againe,\r\n    If happily wee feele the sence of paine;\r\n    For then we're turn'd into a mourning vaine.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Written by Thomas Studley, the first Cape Merchant in Virginia, Robert\r\n  Fenton, Edward Harrington, and J.

D. 1607\r\n\r\n   _The Phoenix from Cape Henry forced to the West Indies._ {MN}\r\n\r\nAll this time our care was not so much to abandon the Countrey; but the\r\nTreasurer and Councell in England, were as diligent & carefull to supply\r\nus. Two good ships they sent us, with neare a hundred men, well furnished\r\nwith all things could be imagined necessary, both for them and us; The one\r\ncommanded by Captaine Newport: the other by Captaine Francis Nelson, an\r\nhonest man, and an expert Marriner. {MN} But such was the lewardnesse of\r\nhis Ship (that though he was within the sight of Cape Henry) by stormy\r\ncontrary winds was he forced so farre to Sea, that the West Indies was the\r\nnext land, for the repaire of his Masts, and reliefe of wood and water.\r\nBut Newport got in and arrived at James Towne, not long after the\r\nredemption of Captaine Smith. To whom the Salvages, as is sayd, every\r\nother day repaired, with such provisions that sufficiently did serve them\r\nfrom hand to mouth: part alwayes they brought him as Presents from their\r\nKings, or Pocahontas; the rest he as their Market Clarke set the price\r\nhimselfe, how they should sell: so he had inchanted these poore [III.51.]\r\nsoules being their prisoner; and now Newport, whom he called his Father\r\narriving, neare as directly as he foretold, they esteemed him as an\r\nOracle, and had them at that submission he might command them what he\r\nlisted. That God that created all things they knew he adored for his God:\r\nthey would also in their discourses tearme the God of Captaine Smith.\r\n\r\n            _Their opinion of our God._\r\n\r\n    Thus the Almightie was the bringer on,\r\n    The guide, path, terme, all which was God alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n               _Smiths revisting Powhatan_ {MN}\r\n\r\nBut the President and Councell so much envied his estimation among the\r\nSalvages, (though we all in generall equally participated with him of the\r\ngood thereof,) that they wrought it into the Salvages understandings (by\r\ntheir great bounty in giving foure times more for their commodities then\r\nSmith appointed) that their greatnesse and authoritie as much exceeded\r\nhis, as their bountie and liberalitie. Now the arrivall of this first\r\nsupply so overjoyed us, that wee could not devise too much to please the\r\nMarriners. We gave them libertie to trucke or trade at their pleasures.\r\nBut in a short time it followed, that could not be had for a pound of\r\nCopper, which before was sould us for an ounce: thus ambition and\r\nsufferance cut the throat of our trade, but confirmed their opinion of the\r\ngreatnesse of Capt. Newport, (wherewith Smith had possessed Powhatan)\r\nespecially by the great presents Newport often sent him, before he could\r\nprepare the Pinnace to goe and visit him: so that this great Savage\r\ndesired also to see him. A great coyle there was to set him forward. {MN}\r\nWhen he went he was accompanied with Captaine Smith, & Mr. Scrivener, a\r\nvery wise understanding Gentleman, newly arrived and admitted of the\r\nCouncell, with thirtie or fortie chosen men for their guard. Arriving at\r\nWerowocomoco, Newports conceit of this great Savage bred many doubts and\r\nsuspitions of trecheries, which Smith to make appeare was needlesse, with\r\ntwentie men well appointed, undertooke to encounter the worst that could\r\nhappen: Knowing\r\n\r\n    All is but one, and selfe-same hand, that thus\r\n    Both one while scourgeth, and that helpeth us.\r\n\r\n                      Gent.\r\n\r\n  Nathaniell Powell,              Richard Wyffin.\r\n  Robert Behethland.

Which caused Smith to make diverse Salvages goe over\r\nfirst, keeping some of the chiefe as hostage till halfe his men were\r\npassed, to make a guard for himselfe and the rest. But finding all things\r\nwell, by two or three hundred Salvages they were kindly conducted to their\r\ntowne. {MN-1} Where Powhatan strained himselfe to the utmost of his\r\ngreatnesse to entertaine them, with great shouts of joy, Orations of\r\nprotestations; and with the most plenty of victualls he could provide to\r\nfeast them. Sitting upon his bed of mats, his pillow of leather imbrodered\r\n(after their rude manner with pearle and white Beads) his attyre a faire\r\nrobe of skinnes as large as an Irish mantell: at his head and feete a\r\nhandsome young woman: on each side his house sat twentie of his\r\nConcubines, their heads and shoulders painted red, with a great chaine of\r\nwhite beads about each of their neckes. Before those sat his chiefest men\r\nin like order in his arbour-like house, and more then fortie platters of\r\nfine bread stood as a guard in two fyles on each side the doore. Foure or\r\nfive hundred people made a guard behinde them for our passage; and\r\nProclamation was made, none upon paine of death to presume to doe us any\r\nwrong or discourtesie. With many pretty Discourses to renew their old\r\nacquaintance, [III.52] this great King and our Captaine spent the time,\r\ntill the ebbe left our Barge aground. Then renewing their feasts with\r\nfeates, dauncing and singing, and such like mirth, we quartered that night\r\nwith Powhatan. The next day Newport came a shore and received as much\r\ncontent as those people could give him: {MN-2} a boy named Thomas Salvage\r\nwas then given unto Powhatan, whom Newport called his sonne; for whom\r\nPowhatan gave him Namontack his trustie servant, and one of a shrewd,\r\nsubtill capacitie. Three or foure dayes more we spent in feasting,\r\ndauncing, and trading, wherein Powhatan carried himselfe so proudly, yet\r\ndiscreetly (in his salvage manner) as made us all admire his naturall\r\ngifts, considering his education. As scorning to trade as his subjects did;\r\nhe bespake Newport in this manner.\r\n\r\n                  _Powhatans speech._\r\n\r\n             _Differences of opinion._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n               _James towne burnt._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\n          _A ship Idely loytering 14. weekes._ {MN-3}\r\n\r\n            _The effect of mere verbalists._ {MN-4}\r\n\r\n             _A needlesse charge._ {MN-5}\r\n\r\n             _A return to England._ {MN-6}\r\n\r\nCaptaine Newport it is not agreeable to my greatnesse, in this pedling\r\nmanner to trade for trifles; and I esteeme you also a great Werowance.\r\nTherefore lay me downe all your commodities together; what I like I will\r\ntake, and in recompence give you what I thinke fitting their value.\r\nCaptaine Smith being our interpreter, regarding Newport as his father,\r\nknowing best the disposition of Powhatan, tould us his intent was but\r\nonely to cheate us; yet Captaine Newport thinking to out brave this\r\nSalvage in ostentation of greatnesse, and so to bewitch him with his\r\nbountie, as to have what he listed, it so hapned, that Powhatan having his\r\ndesire, valued his corne at such a rate, that I thinke it better cheape in\r\nSpaine: for we had not foure bushells for that we expected to have twentie\r\nhogsheads. {MN-1} This bred some unkindnesse betweene our two Captaines;\r\nNewport seeking to please the unsatiable desire of the Salvage, Smith to\r\ncause the Salvage to please him; but smothering his distast to avoyd the\r\nSalvages suspition, glanced in the eyes of Powhatan many trifles, who\r\nfixed his humor upon a few blew beades. A long time he importunately\r\ndesired them, but Smith seemed so much the more to affect them, as being\r\ncomposed of a most rare substance of the coulour of the skyes, and not to\r\nbe worne but by the greatest kings in the world. This made him halfe madde\r\nto be the owner of such strange Jewells: so that ere we departed, for a\r\npound or two of blew beades, he brought over my king for 2. or 300.\r\nBushells of corne; yet parted good friends. The like entertainment we\r\nfound of Opechankanough king of Pamaunkee, whom also he in like manner\r\nfitted (at the like rates) with blew beads, which grew by this meanes, of\r\nthat estimation, that none durst weare any of them but their great kings,\r\ntheir wives and children. And so we returned all well to James towne,\r\n{MN-2} where this new supply being lodged with the rest, accidentally\r\nfired their quarters and so the towne, which being but thatched with\r\nreeds, the fire was so fierce as it burnt their Pallisado's, (though eight\r\nor ten yards distant) with their Armes, bedding, apparell, and much\r\nprivate provision. Good Master Hunt our Preacher lost all his Library and\r\nall he had but the cloathes on his backe: yet none never heard him repine\r\nat his losse. This happned in the winter in that extreame frost, 1607.\r\n{MN-3} Now though we had victuall sufficient I meane onely of Oatmeale,\r\nmeale and corne, yet the Ship staying 14. weekes when shee might as wel\r\nhave beene gone in 14. dayes, spent a great part of that, and neare all\r\nthe rest that was sent to be landed. When they departed what there\r\ndiscretion could spare us, to make a little poore meale or two, we called\r\nfeastes, to relish our mouthes: of each somwhat they left us, yet I must\r\nconfesse, those that had either money, spare clothes credit to give billes\r\nof paiment, gold rings, furrs, or any such commodities, were ever welcome\r\nto this removing taverne, such was our patience to obay such vile\r\nCommanders, and buy our owne provisions at 15 times the value, suffering\r\nthem feast (we bearing the charge) yet must not repine, but fast, least we\r\nshould incurre the censure of factious and seditious persons: and then\r\nleakage, ship-rats, and other casuallties occasioned them losse, but the\r\nvessels and remnants (for totals) we were glad to receave with all our\r\nhearts to make up the account, highly commending their providence for\r\npreserving that, least they should discourage any more to come to us. Now\r\nfor all this plenty our ordynary was but meale and water, so that this\r\ngreat charge little releeved our wants, whereby with the extremitie of the\r\nbitter cold frost and those [III.53.] defects, more then halfe of us dyed;\r\nI cannot deny but both Smith and Skrivener did their best to amend what\r\nwas amisse, but with the President went the major part, that there hornes\r\nwere to short. {MN-4} But the worst was our guilded refiners with their\r\ngolden promises made all men their slaves in hope of recompences; there\r\nwas no talke, no hope, no worke, but dig gold, wash gold, refine gold,\r\nloade gold, such a bruit of gold, that one mad fellow desired to be buried\r\nin the sands least they should by there art make gold of his bones: little\r\nneede there was and lesse reason, the ship should stay, there wages run\r\non, our victualls consume 14. weekes, that the Mariners might say, they\r\ndid helpe to build such a golden Church that we can say the raine washed\r\nneere to nothing in 14. dayes. {MN-5} Were it that captaine Smith would\r\nnot applaude all those golden inventions, because they admitted him not to\r\nthe sight of their trialls nor golden consultations, I know not; but I\r\nhave heard him oft question with Captaine Martin & tell him, except he\r\ncould shew him a more substantiall triall, he was not inamoured with their\r\ndurty skill, breathing out these and many other passions, never any thing\r\ndid more torment him, then to see all necessary busines neglected, to\r\nfraught such a drunken ship with so much guilded durt. Till then we never\r\naccounted, Captaine Newport a refiner, {MN-6} who being ready to set saile\r\nfor England, & we not having any use of Parliaments, Plaies, Petitions,\r\nAdmiralls, Recorders, Interpreters, Chronologers, Courts of Plea, nor\r\nJustices of peace, sent Master Wingfield and Captaine Archer home with\r\nhim, that had ingrossed all those titles, to seeke some better place of\r\nimployment.\r\n\r\n    Oh cursed gold those, hunger-starved movers,\r\n    To what misfortunes lead'st thou all those lovers!\r\n    For all the China wealth, nor Indies can\r\n    Suffice the minde of an av'ritious man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Chap.

All men thus busie at their severall\r\nlabours, Master Nelson arrived with his lost Phoenix; lost (I say) for\r\nthat we all deemed him lost. Landing safely all his men, (so well he had\r\nmannaged his ill hap,) causing the Indian Isles to feede his company, that\r\nhis victuall to that we had gotten, as is said before, was neare after our\r\nallowance sufficient for halfe a yeare. He had not any thing but he freely\r\nimparted it, which honest dealing (being a Marriner) caused us admire him:\r\nwe would not have wished more then he did for us. Now to relade this ship\r\nwith some good tydings, the President (not holding it stood with the\r\ndignitie of his place to leave the Fort) gave order to Captaine Smith to\r\ndiscover and search the commodities of the Monacans Countrey beyond the\r\nFalls. {MN-2} Sixtie able men was allotted them, the which within six\r\ndayes, Smith had so well trained to their armes and orders, that they\r\nlittle feared with whom they should incounter: yet so unseasonable was the\r\ntime, and so opposit was Captaine Martin to any thing, but onely to\r\nfraught this ship also with his phantasticall gold, as Captaine Smith\r\nrather desired to relade her with Cedar, (which was a present dispatch)\r\nthen either with durt, or the hopes and reports of an uncertaine\r\ndiscovery, which he would performe when they had lesse charge and more\r\nleisure.\r\n\r\n    But, The God of Heav'n, He eas'ly can [III. 54.]\r\n         Immortalize a mortall man,\r\n               With glory and with fame.\r\n             The same God, ev'n as eas'ly may\r\n             Afflict a mortall man, I say,\r\n               With sorrow and with shame.\r\n\r\nWhilst the conclusion was a resolving, this hapned.\r\n\r\n          _An ill example to sell swords to Salvages._\r\n\r\n              _The Presidents weaknesse._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n    _Smiths attempt to suppresse the Salvages insolences._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\n                  _Powhatans excuse._ {MN-3}\r\n\r\nPowhatan (to expresse his love to Newport) when he departed, presented him\r\nwith twentie Turkies, conditionally to returne him twentie swords, which\r\nimmediately was sent him; now after his departure he presented Captaine\r\nSmith with the like luggage, but not finding his humor obeyed in not\r\nsending such weapons as he desired, he caused his people with twentie\r\ndevices to obtaine them. At last by ambuscadoes at our very Ports they\r\nwould take them perforce, surprise us at worke, or any way; which was so\r\nlong permitted, they became so insolent there was no rule; the command\r\nfrom England was so strait not to offend them, {MN-1} as our\r\nauthoritie-bearers (keeping their houses) would rather be any thing then\r\npeace-breakers. This charitable humor prevailed, till well it chanced they\r\nmedled with Captaine Smith, {MN-2} who without farther deliberation gave\r\nthem such an incounter, as some he so hunted up and downe the Isle, some\r\nhe so terrified with whipping, beating, and imprisonment, as for revenge\r\nthey surprised two of our forraging disorderly souldiers, and having\r\nassembled their forces, boldly threatned at our Ports to force Smith to\r\nredeliver seven Salvages, which for their villanies he detained prisoners,\r\nor we were all but dead men. But to try their furies he sallied out\r\namongst them, and in lesse then an houre, he so hampred their insolencies,\r\nthey brought them his two men, desiring peace without any further\r\ncomposition for their prisoners. Those he examined, and caused them all\r\nbeleeve, by severall vollies of shot one of their companions was shot to\r\ndeath, because they would not confesse their intents and plotters of those\r\nvillanies. And thus they all agreed in one point, they were directed onely\r\nby Powhatan to obtaine him our weapons, to cut our owne throats, with the\r\nmanner where, how, and when, which we plainly found most true and\r\napparant: {MN-3} yet he sent his messengers, and his dearest daughter\r\nPocahontas with presents to excuse him of the injuries done by some rash\r\nuntoward Captaines his subjects, desiring their liberties for this time,\r\nwith the assurance of his love for ever. After Smith had given the\r\nprisoners what correction he thought fit, used them well a day or two\r\nafter, & then delivered them Pocahontas, for whose sake onely he fayned to\r\nhave saved their lives, and gave them libertie. The patient Councell that\r\nnothing would move to warre with the Salvages, would gladly have wrangled\r\nwith Captaine Smith for his crueltie, yet none was slaine to any mans\r\nknowledge, but it brought them in such feare and obedience, as his very\r\nname would sufficiently affright them; where before, wee had sometime\r\npeace and warre twice in a day, and very seldome a weeke, but we had some\r\ntrecherous villany or other.\r\n\r\n                  _A ship fraught with Cedar._\r\n\r\nThe fraught of this Ship being concluded to be Cedar, by the diligence of\r\nthe Master, and Captaine Smith, she was quickly reladed: Master Scrivener\r\nwas neither idle nor slow to follow all things at the Fort; the Ship being\r\nready to set sayle, Captaine Martin being alwayes very sickly, and\r\nunserviceable, and desirous to injoy the credit of his supposed Art of\r\nfinding the golden Mine, was most willingly admitted to returne for\r\nEngland.

The first people\r\nwe saw were two grim and stout Salvages upon Cape Charles, with long poles\r\nlike Javelings, headed with bone, they [III.56.] boldly demanded what we\r\nwere, and what we would; but after many circumstances they seemed very\r\nkinde, and directed us to Accomack, the habitation of their Werowance,\r\nwhere we were kindly intreated. This King was the comliest, proper, civill\r\nSalvage we incountred. His Country is a pleasant fertile clay soyle, some\r\nsmall creekes; good Harbours for small Barks, but not for Ships. {MN-1} He\r\ntold us of a strange accident lately happened him, and it was, two\r\nchildren being dead; some extreame passions, or dreaming visions,\r\nphantasies, or affection moved their parents againe to revisit their dead\r\ncarkases, whose benummed bodies reflected to the eyes of the beholders\r\nsuch delightfull countenances, as though they had regained their vitall\r\nspirits. This as, a miracle drew many to behold them, all which being a\r\ngreat part of his people, not long after dyed, and but few escaped. They\r\nspake the language of Powhatan, wherein they made such descriptions of the\r\nBay, Isles, and rivers, that often did us exceeding pleasure. Passing\r\nalong the coast, searching every inlet, and Bay, fit for harbours and\r\nhabitations. Seeing many Isles in the midst of the Bay we bore up for\r\nthem, but ere we could obtaine them, such an extreame gust of wind, rayne,\r\nthunder, and lightening happened, that with great danger we escaped the\r\nunmercifull raging of that Ocean-like water. {MN-2} The highest land on\r\nthe mayne, yet it was but low, we called Keales hill, and these\r\nuninhabited Isles, Russels Isles. {MN-3} The next day searching them for\r\nfresh water, we could find none, the defect whereof forced us to follow\r\nthe next Easterne Channell, which brought us to the river of Wighcocomoco.\r\nThe people at first with great fury seemed to assault us, yet at last with\r\nsongs and daunces and much mirth became very tractable, but searching\r\ntheir habitations for water, we could fill but three barricoes, & that\r\nsuch puddle, that never till then we ever knew the want of good water.\r\n{MN-4} We digged and searched in many places, but before two daies were\r\nexpired, we would have refused two barricoes of gold for one of that\r\npuddle water of Wighcocomoco. Being past these Isles which are many in\r\nnumber, but all naught for habitation, falling with a high land upon the\r\nmayne, we found a great Pond of fresh water, but so exceeding hot wee\r\nsupposed it some bath; that place we called poynt Ployer, in honor of that\r\nmost honourable House of Mousay in Britaine, that in an extreame\r\nextremitie once relieved our Captaine. From Wighcocomoco to this place,\r\nall the coast is low broken Isles of Mira's, growne a myle or two in\r\nbreadth, and ten or twelve in length, good to cut for hay in Summer, and\r\nto catch fish and foule in Winter: but the Land beyond them is all covered\r\nover with wood, as is the rest of the Country.\r\n\r\n          _Their Barge neare sunke in a gust._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                    _Cuskarawaock._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\n         _The first notice of the Massawomeks._ {MN-3}\r\n\r\n                    _Bolus River._ {MN-4}\r\n\r\nBeing thus refreshed in crossing over from the maine to other Isles, we\r\ndiscovered the winde and waters so much increased with thunder, lightning,\r\nand raine, {MN-1} that our mast and sayle blew overbord and such mighty\r\nwaves overracked us in that small barge that with great labour we kept her\r\nfrom sinking by freeing out the water. Two dayes we were inforced to\r\ninhabite these uninhabited Isles which for the extremitie of gusts,\r\nthunder, raine, stormes, and ill wether we called Limbo. Repairing our\r\nsaile with our shirts, {MN-2} we set sayle for the maine and fell with a\r\npretty convenient river on the East called Cuskarawaok, the people ran as\r\namazed in troups from place to place, and divers got into the tops of\r\ntrees, they were not sparing of their arrowes, nor the greatest passion\r\nthey could expresse of their anger. Long they shot, we still ryding at an\r\nAnchor without there reatch making all the signes of friendship we could.\r\nThe next day they came unarmed, with every one a basket, dancing in a\r\nring, to draw us on shore: but seeing there was nothing in them but\r\nvillany, we discharged a volly of muskets charged with pistoll shot,\r\nwhereat they all lay tumbling on the grownd, creeping some one way, some\r\nanother into a great cluster of reedes hard by; where there companies lay\r\nin Ambuscado. Towards the evening we wayed, & approaching the shoare,\r\ndischarging five or six shot among the reedes, we landed where there lay a\r\nmany of baskets and much bloud, but saw not a Salvage. A smoake appearing\r\non the other side the river, we rowed thither, where we found two or three\r\nlittle houses, in each a fire, there we left some peeces of copper, beads,\r\nbells, and looking glasses, and then went into the bay, but when it was\r\ndarke we came backe againe. Early, [III.57.] in the morning foure Salvages\r\ncame to us in their Canow whom we used with such courtesie, not knowing\r\nwhat we were, nor had done, having beene in the bay a fishing, bade us\r\nstay and ere long they would returne, which they did and some twentie more\r\nwith them; with whom after a little conference, two or three thousand men\r\nwomen & children came clustring about us, every one presenting us with\r\nsomething, which a little bead would so well requite, that we became such\r\nfriends they would contend who should fetch us water, stay with us for\r\nhostage, conduct our men any whither, and give us the best content. Here\r\ndoth inhabite the people of Sarapinagh, Nause, Arseek, and Nantaquak the\r\nbest Marchants of all other Salvages. {MN-3} They much extolled a great\r\nnation called Massawomekes, in search of whom we returned by Limbo: this\r\nriver but onely at the entrance is very narrow, and the people of small\r\nstature as them of Wightcocomoco, the Land but low, yet it may prove very\r\ncommodious, because it is but a ridge of land betwixt the Bay and the\r\nmaine Ocean. Finding this Easterne shore, shallow broken Isles, and for\r\nmost part without fresh water, we passed by the straites of Limbo for the\r\nWesterne shore: so broad is the bay here, we could scarce perceive the\r\ngreat high clifts on the other side: by them we Anchored that night and\r\ncalled them Riccards Cliftes. 30. leagues we sayled more Northwards not\r\nfinding any inhabitants, leaving all the Easterne shore, lowe Islandes,\r\nbut overgrowne with wood, as all the Coast beyond them so farre as wee\r\ncould see: the Westerne shore by which we sayled we found all along well\r\nwatered, but very mountanous and barren, the vallies very fertill, but\r\nextreame thicke of small wood so well as trees, and much frequented with\r\nWolves, Beares, Deere and other wild beasts. {MN-4} We passed many\r\nshallow creekes, but the first we found Navigable for a ship, we called\r\nBolus, for that the clay in many places under the clifts by the high water\r\nmarke, did grow up in red and white knots as gum out of trees; and in some\r\nplaces so participated together as though they were all of one nature,\r\nexcepting the coulour, the rest of the earth on both sides being hard\r\nsandy gravell, which made us thinke it Bole-Armoniack and Terra sigillata.\r\nWhen we first set sayle some of our Gallants doubted nothing but that our\r\nCaptaine would make too much hast home, but having lien in this small\r\nbarge not above 12. or 14. dayes, oft tyred at the Oares, our bread\r\nspoyled with wet so much that it was rotten (yet so good were their\r\nstomacks that they could disgest it) they did with continuall complaints\r\nso importune him now to returne, as caused him bespeake them in this\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n               _Smith's speech to his Souldiers._\r\n\r\n               _The discovery of Patawomek._ {MN}\r\n\r\nGentlemen if you would remember the memorable history of Sir Ralph Layne,\r\nhow his company importuned him to proceed in the discovery of Moratico,\r\nalleadging they had yet a dog, that being boyled with Saxafras leaves,\r\nwould richly feede them in their returnes; then what a shame would it be\r\nfor you (that have bin so suspitious of my tendernesse) to force me\r\nreturne, with so much provision as we have, and scarce able to say where\r\nwe have beene, nor yet heard of that we were sent to seeke? You cannot say\r\nbut I have shared with you in the worst which is past; and for what is to\r\ncome, of lodging, dyet, or whatsoever, I am contented you allot the worst\r\npart to my selfe. As for your feares that I will lose my selfe in these\r\nunknowne large waters, or be swallowed up in some stormie gust; abandon\r\nthese childish feares, for worse then is past is not likely to happen: and\r\nthere is as much danger to returne as to proceede. Regaine therefore your\r\nold spirits for returne I will not (if God please) till I have seene the\r\nMassawomeks, found Patawomek, or the head of this water you conceit to be\r\nendlesse. {MN} Two or 3. dayes we expected winde & wether, whose adverse\r\nextremities added such discouragement, that three or foure fell sicke,\r\nwhose pittifull complaints caused us to returne, leaving the bay some nine\r\nmiles broad, at nine and ten fadome water.\r\n\r\n               _Ambuscadoes of Salvages._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThe 16. of June we fell with the river Patowomek: feare being gone, and\r\nour men recovered, we were all content to take some paines, to know the\r\nname of that seven mile broad river: for thirtie myles sayle, we could\r\nsee no inhabitants: {MN} then we were conducted by two Salvages up a\r\nlittle bayed creeke, towards Onawmanient, where all the woods were layd\r\nwith ambuscado's to the number of three or foure thousand Salvages, so\r\nstrangely paynted, grimed and disguised, shouting, yelling and crying as\r\nso many spirits from hell could not have shewed more terrible. Many\r\nbravado's they made, but to appease their fury, our Captaine prepared with\r\nas seeming a willingnesse (as they) to incounter them. But the grazing of\r\nour bullets upon the water (many being shot on purpose they might see\r\nthem) with the Ecco of the woods so amazed them, as downe went their bowes\r\nand arrowes; (and exchanging hostage) James Watkins was sent six myles up\r\nthe woods to their Kings habitation. We were kindly used of those\r\nSalvages, of whom we understood, they were commanded to betray us, by the\r\ndirection of Powhatan, and he so directed from the discontents at James\r\ntowne, because our Captaine did cause them stay in their country against\r\ntheir wills.\r\n\r\n                  _A trecherous project._\r\n\r\n               _A myne like Antimony._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n            _An aboundant plenty of fish._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nThe like incounters we found at Patowomek Cecocawonee and divers other\r\nplaces: but at Moyaones, Nacotchtant and Toags the people did their best\r\nto content us. Having gone so high as we could with the bote, we met\r\ndivers Salvages in Canowes, well loaden with the flesh of Beares, Deere\r\nand other beasts, whereof we had part, here we found mighty Rocks, growing\r\nin some places above the grownd as high as the shrubby trees, and divers\r\nother solid quarries of divers tinctures: and divers places where the\r\nwaters had falne from the high mountaines they had left a tinctured\r\nspangled skurfe, that made many bare places seeme as guilded. Digging the\r\ngrownde above in the highest cliffs of rocks, we saw it was a claie sand\r\nso mingled with yeallow spangles as if it had beene halfe pin-dust. In our\r\nreturne inquiring still for this Matchqueon, the king of Patawomeke gave\r\nus guides to conduct us up a little river called Quiyough, up which we\r\nrowed so high as we could. Leaving the bote, with six shot, and divers\r\nSalvages, he marched seven or eight myle before they came to the mine:\r\nleading his hostages in a small chaine they were to have for their paines,\r\nbeing proud so richly to be adorned. {MN-1} The mine is a great Rocky\r\nmountaine like Antimony; wherein they digged a great hole with shells &\r\nhatchets: and hard by it, runneth a fayre brooke of Christal-like water,\r\nwhere they wash away the drosse and keepe the remainder, which they put in\r\nlittle baggs and sell it all over the country to paint there bodyes,\r\nfaces, or Idols; which makes them looke like Blackmores dusted over with\r\nsilver. With so much as we could carry we returned to our bote, kindly\r\nrequiting this kinde king and all his kinde people. The cause of this\r\ndiscovery was to search this mine, of which Newport did assure us that\r\nthose small baggs (we had given him) in England he had tryed to hold halfe\r\nsilver; but all we got proved of no value: also to search what furrs, the\r\nbest whereof is at Cuscarawaoke, where is made so much Rawranoke or white\r\nbeads that occasion as much dissention among the Salvages, as gold and\r\nsilver amongst Christians; and what other mineralls, rivers, rocks,\r\nnations, woods, fishings, fruites, victuall, and what other commodities\r\nthe land afforded: and whether the bay were endlesse or how farre it\r\nextended: of mines we were all ignorant, but a few Bevers, Otters, Beares,\r\nMartins and minkes we found, {MN-2} and in divers places that aboundance\r\nof fish, lying so thicke with their heads above the water, as for want of\r\nnets (our barge driving amongst them) we attempted to catch them with a\r\nfrying pan: but we found it a bad instrument to catch fish with: neither\r\nbetter fish, more plenty, nor more variety for smal fish, had any of us\r\never seene in any place so swimming in the water, but they are not to be\r\ncaught with frying pans: some small codd also we did see swim close by the\r\nshore by Smiths Iles, and some as high as Riccards Clifts. And some we\r\nhave found dead upon the shore.\r\n\r\n               _How to deale with the Salvages._\r\n\r\n        _Captaine Smith neare killed with a Stingray._ {MN}\r\n\r\nTo express all our quarrels, trecheries and encounters amongst those\r\nSalvages I should be too tedious: but in breefe, at all times we so\r\nincountred them, and curbed their insolencies, that they concluded with\r\npresents to purchase peace; yet we lost not a man: at our first meeting\r\nour Captaine ever observed this order to demand their bowes and arrowes,\r\nswordes, mantells and furrs, with some childe or two for hostage, whereby\r\nwe could quickly perceive, when they intended any villany. Having finished\r\nthis discovery (though our victuall was neere spent) he intended to see\r\nhis imprisonment-acquaintances [III.59.] upon the river of Rapahanock, by\r\nmany called Toppahanock, but our bote by reason of the ebbe, chansing to\r\ngrownd upon a many shoules lying in the entrances, we spyed many fishes\r\nlurking in the reedes: our Captaine sporting himselfe by nayling them to\r\nthe grownd with his sword, set us all a fishing in that manner: thus we\r\ntooke more in one houre then we could eate in a day. {MN} But it chansed\r\nour Captaine taking a fish from his sword (not knowing her condition)\r\nbeing much of the fashion of a Thornback, but a long tayle like a ryding\r\nrodde, whereon the middest is a most poysoned sting, of two or three\r\ninches long, bearded like a saw on each side, which she strucke into the\r\nwrest of his arme neere an inch and a halfe: no bloud nor wound was seene,\r\nbut a little blew spot, but the torment was instantly so extreame, that in\r\nfoure houres had so swolen his hand, arme and shoulder, we all with much\r\nsorrow concluded his funerall, and prepared his grave in an Island by, as\r\nhimselfe directed: yet it pleased God by a precious oyle Docter Russell at\r\nthe first applyed to it when he sounded it with probe (ere night) his\r\ntormenting paine was so well asswaged that he eate of the fish to his\r\nsupper, which gave no lesse joy and content to us then ease to himselfe,\r\nfor which we called the Island Stingray Isle after the name of the fish.\r\n\r\n      _The Salvages affrightened with their owne suspition._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n              _Needlesse misery at James towne._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nHaving neither Chirurgian, nor Chirurgery, but that preservative oyle we\r\npresently set sayles for James towne, passing the mouthes of the rivers of\r\nPayankatank, & Pamaunkee, the next day we safely arrived at Kecougtan.\r\n{MN-1} The simple Salvages seeing our Captaine hurt, and an other bloudy\r\nby breaking his shinne, our numbers of bowes, arrowes, swords, mantles,\r\nand furrs, would needes imagine we had beene at warres (the truth of these\r\naccidents would not satisfie them) but impatiently importuned us to know\r\nwith whom. Finding their aptnesse to beleeve we fayled not (as a great\r\nsecret) to tell them any thing that might affright them, what spoyle we\r\nhad got and made of the Massawomeks. This rumor went faster up the river\r\nthen our Barge, that arrived at Waraskoyack the 20 of July; where trimming\r\nher with painted streamers, and such devises as we could, we made them at\r\nJames towne jealous of a Spanish Frigot, where we all God be thanked\r\nsafely arrived the 21 of July. {MN-2} There we found the last Supply were\r\nall sicke, the rest some lame, some bruised, all unable to doe any thing\r\nbut complaine of the pride and unreasonable needlesse crueltie of the\r\nsilly President, that had riotously consumed the store: and to fulfill his\r\nfollies about building him an unnecessary building for his pleasure in the\r\nwoods, had brought them all to that misery; that had we not arrived, they\r\nhad as strangely tormented him with revenge: but the good newes of our\r\nDiscovery, and the good hope we had by the Salvages relation, that our Bay\r\nhad stretched into the South Sea, or somewhat neare it, appeased their\r\nfury; but conditionally that Ratliffe should be deposed, and that\r\nCaptaine Smith would take upon him the government, as by course it did\r\nbelong. Their request being effected, he substituted Mr. Scrivener his\r\ndeare friend in the Presidency, equally distributing those private\r\nprovisions the other had ingrossed, appointing more honest officers to\r\nassist master Scrivener (who then lay exceeding sicke of a Callenture) and\r\nin regard of the weaknesse of the company, and heate of the yeare, they\r\nbeing unable to worke, he left them to live at ease, to recover their\r\nhealths, but imbarked himselfe to finish his Discovery.\r\n\r\n    Written by Walter Russell, Anas Todkill, and Thomas Momford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Chap.

The first night we anchored at Stingray Isle. The next day\r\ncrossed Patawomeks river, and hasted to the river Bolus. We went not much\r\nfurther before we might see the Bay to divide in two heads, and arriving\r\nthere we found it divided in foure, all which we searched so farre as we\r\ncould sayle them. {MN-2} Two of them we found inhabited, but in crossing\r\nthe Bay, we incountred 7 or 8 Canowes full of Massawomeks, we seeing them\r\nprepare to assault us, left our Oares and made way with our sayle to\r\nincounter them, yet were we but five with our Captaine that could stand,\r\nfor within 2 dayes after we left Kecoughtan, the rest (being all of the\r\nlast supply) were sicke almost to death, untill they were seasoned to the\r\nCountry. Having shut them under our Tarpawling, we put their hats upon\r\nstickes by the Barges side, and betwixt two hats a man with two peeces, to\r\nmake us seeme many, and so we thinke the Indians supposed those hats to be\r\nmen, for they fled with all possible speed to the shore, and there stayed,\r\nstaring at the sayling of our barge till we anchored right against them.\r\nLong it was ere we could draw them to come unto us. At last they sent two\r\nof their company unarmed in a Canow, the rest all followed to second them\r\nif neede required. These two being but each presented with a bell, brought\r\naboord all their fellowes, presenting our Captaine with venison, beares\r\nflesh, fish, bowes, arrowes, clubs, targets, and beares-skinnes. We\r\nunderstood them nothing at all, but by signes, whereby they signified unto\r\nus they had beene at warres with the Tockwoghes, the which they confirmed\r\nby showing us their greene wounds, but the night parting us, we imagined\r\nthey appointed the next morning to meete, but after that we never saw\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n                  _An Incounter with the Tockwoghs._\r\n\r\nEntring the river of Tockwogh, the Salvages all armed, in a fleete of\r\nboats, after their barbarous manner, round invironed us; so it chanced one\r\nof them could speake the language of Powhatan, who perswaded the rest to\r\na friendly parley. But when they saw us furnished with the Massawomeks\r\nweapons, and we faining the invention of Kecoughtan, to have taken them\r\nperforce; they conducted us to their pallizadoed towne, mantelled with the\r\nbarkes of trees, with scaffolds like mounts, brested about with brests\r\nvery formally. Their men, women, and children with daunces, songs, fruits,\r\nfurres, and what they had, kindly welcommed us, spreading mats for us to\r\nsit on, stretching their best abilities to expresse their loves.\r\n\r\n               _Hatchets from the Sasquesahanocks._\r\n\r\nMany hatchets, knives, peeces of iron, and brasse, we saw amongst them,\r\nwhich they reported to have from the Sasquesahanocks, a mightie people and\r\nmortall enemies with the Massawomeks. The Sasquesahanocks inhabit upon the\r\nchiefe Spring of these foure branches of the Bayes head, two dayes journey\r\nhigher then our barge could passe for rocks, yet we prevailed with the\r\nInterpreter to take with him another Interpreter, to perswade the\r\nSasquesahanocks to come visit us, for their language are different. Three\r\nor foure dayes we expected their returne, then sixtie of those gyant-like\r\npeople came downe, with presents of Venison, Tobacco-pipes three foot in\r\nlength, Baskets, Targets, Bowes and Arrowes. Five of their chiefe\r\nWerowances came boldly aboord us to crosse the Bay for Tockwhogh, leaving\r\ntheir men and Canowes; the wind being so high they durst not passe.\r\n\r\n         _The Sasquesahanocks offer to the English._ {MN}\r\n\r\nOur order was daily to have Prayer, with a Psalme, at which solemnitie the\r\npoore Salvages much wondred, our Prayers being done, a while they were\r\nbusied with a consultation till they had contrived their businesse.\r\n[III.61.] {MN} Then they began in a most passionate manner to hold up\r\ntheir hands to the Sunne, with a most fearefull song, then embracing our\r\nCaptaine, they began to adore him in like manner: though he rebuked them,\r\nyet they proceeded till their song was finished: which done with a most\r\nstrange furious action, and a hellish voyce, began an Oration of their\r\nloves; that ended, with a great painted Beares skin they covered him: then\r\none ready with a great chayne of white Beads, weighing at least six or\r\nseaven pound, hung it about his necke, the others had 18 mantels, made of\r\ndivers sorts of skinnes sowed together; all these with many other toyes\r\nthey layd at his feete, stroking their ceremonious hands about his necke\r\nfor his Creation to be their Governour and Protector, promising their\r\naydes, victualls, or what they had to be his, if he would stay with them,\r\nto defend and revenge them of the Massawomeks. But we left them at\r\nTockwhogh, sorrowing for our departure, yet we promised the next yeare\r\nagaine to visit them. Many descriptions and discourses they made us, of\r\nAtquanachuck, Massawomek, & other people, signifying they inhabit upon a\r\ngreat water beyond the mountaines, which we understood to be some great\r\nlake, or the river of Canada: and from the French to have their hatchets\r\nand Commodities by trade. These know no more of the territories of\r\nPowhatan, then his name, and he as little of them, but the Atquanachuks\r\nare on the Ocean Sea.\r\n\r\nThe highest mountaine we saw Northward wee called Perigrines mount, and a\r\nrocky river, where the Massawomeks went up, Willowbyes river, in honor of\r\nthe towne our Captaine was borne in, and that honorable house the Lord\r\nWillowby, his most honored good friend. The Sasquesahanocks river we\r\ncalled Smiths falles; the next poynt to Tockwhogh, Pisings poynt; the next\r\nit poynt Bourne. Powells Isles and Smals poynt is by the river Bolus; and\r\nthe little Bay at the head Profits poole; Watkins, Reads, and Momfords\r\npoynts are on each side Limbo; Ward, Cantrell, and Sicklemore, betwixt\r\nPatawomek and Pamaunkee, after the names of the discoverers. In all those\r\nplaces and the furthest we came up the rivers, we cut in trees so many\r\ncrosses as we would, and in many places made holes in trees, wherein we\r\nwrit notes, and in some places crosses of brasse, to signifie to any,\r\nEnglish-men had beene there.\r\n\r\n                         _Pawtuxunt, R._\r\n\r\nThus having sought all the inlets and rivers worth noting, we returned to\r\ndiscover the river of Pawtuxunt; these people we found very tractable, and\r\nmore civill then any, we promised them, as also the Patawomeks to revenge\r\nthem of the Massawomeks, but our purposes were crossed.\r\n\r\n                        _Rapahanock, R._\r\n\r\n          _The exceeding love of the Salvage Mosco._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n             _Our fight with the Rapahanocks._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nIn the discovery of this river some call Rapahanock, we were kindly\r\nentertained by the people of Moraughtacund; here we incountered our old\r\nfriend Mosco, a lusty Salvage of Wighcocomoco upon the river of Patawomek,\r\nwe supposed him some French mans sonne, because he had a thicke blacke\r\nbush beard, and the Salvages seldome have any at all, of which he was not\r\na little proud, to see so many of his Countrymen. {MN-1} Wood and water he\r\nwould fetch us, guide us any whether, cause divers of his Countrymen helpe\r\nus towe against winde or tyde from place to place till we came to\r\nPatawomek: there he rested till we returned from the head of the river,\r\nand occasioned our conduct to the mine we supposed Antimony. And in the\r\nplace he fayled not to doe us all the good he could, perswading us in any\r\ncase not to goe to the Rapahanocks, for they would kill us for being\r\nfriends with the Moraughtacunds that but lately had stolne three of the\r\nKings women. This we did thinke was but that his friends might onely have\r\nour trade: so we crossed the river to the Rapahanocks. {MN-2} There some\r\n12 or 16 standing on the shore, directed us a little Creeke where was good\r\nlanding, and Commodities for us in three or foure Canowes we saw lie\r\nthere: but according to our custome, we demanded to exchange a man in\r\nsigne of love, which after they had a little consulted, foure or five came\r\nup to the middles, to fetch our man, and leave us one of them, shewing we\r\nneed not feare them, for they had neither clubs, bowes, nor arrowes.\r\nNotwithstanding, Anas Todkill, being sent on shore to see if he could\r\ndiscover any Ambuscadoes, or what they had, desired to goe over the playne\r\nto fetch some wood, but they were unwilling, except we would come into the\r\nCreeke, where the boat might come close ashore. Todkill by degrees\r\n[III.62.] having got some two stones throwes up the playne, perceived two\r\nor three hundred men (as he thought) behind the trees, so that offering to\r\nreturne to the Boat, the Salvages assayed to carry him away perforce, that\r\nhe called to us we were betrayed, and by that he had spoke the word, our\r\nhostage was over-boord, but Watkins his keeper slew him in the water.\r\nImmediatly we let fly amongst them, so that they fled, & Todkill escaped,\r\nyet they shot so fast that he fell flat on the ground ere he could recover\r\nthe boat. Here the Massawomek Targets stood us in good stead, for upon\r\nMosco's words, we had set them about the forepart of our Boat like a\r\nforecastle, from whence we securely beat the Salvages from off the plaine\r\nwithout any hurt: yet they shot more then a thousand Arrowes, and then\r\nfled into the woods. Arming our selves with these light Targets (which are\r\nmade of little small sticks woven betwixt strings of their hempe and silke\r\ngrasse, as is our Cloth, but so firmely that no arrow can possibly pierce\r\nthem:) we rescued Todkill, who was all bloudy by some of them who were\r\nshot by us that held him, but as God pleased he had no hurt; and following\r\nthem up to the woods, we found some slaine, and in divers places much\r\nbloud. It seems all their arrowes were spent, for we heard no more of\r\nthem. Their Canows we tooke; the arrowes we found we broke, save them we\r\nkept for Mosco, to whom we gave the Canowes for his kindnesse, that\r\nentertained us in the best triumphing manner, and warlike order in armes\r\nof conquest he could procure of the Moraughtacunds.\r\n\r\n         _The Salvages disguised like bushes fight._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day we spent in accomodating our Boat, in stead of thoules\r\nwee made stickes like Bedstaves, to which we fastened so many of our\r\nMassawomek Targets, that invironed her as wast clothes. The next morning\r\nwe went up the river, and our friend Mosco followed us along the shore,\r\nand at last desired to goe with us in our Boat. But as we passed by\r\nPisacack, Matchopeak, and Mecuppom, three Townes situated upon high white\r\nclay clifts; the other side all a low playne marish, and the river there\r\nbut narrow. {MN} Thirtie or fortie of the Rapahanocks, had so accommodated\r\nthemselves with branches, as we tooke them for little bushes growing\r\namong the sedge, still seeing their arrowes strike the Targets, and\r\ndropped in the river: whereat Mosco fell flat in the Boat on his face,\r\ncrying the Rapahanocks, which presently we espied to be the bushes, which\r\nat our first volley fell downe in the sedge: when wee were neare halfe a\r\nmyle from them, they shewed themselves dauncing and singing very merrily.\r\n\r\nThe Kings of Pissassack, Nandtaughtacund, and Cuttatawomen, used us\r\nkindly, and all their people neglected not any thing to Mosco to bring us\r\nto them. Betwixt Secobeck and Massawteck is a small Isle or two, which\r\ncauseth the river to be broader then ordinary; there it pleased God to\r\ntake one of our Company called Mr. Fetherstone, that all the time he had\r\nbeene in this Country, had behaved himselfe, honestly, valiantly, and\r\nindustriously, where in a little Bay, we called Fetherstones Bay wee\r\nburyed him with a volley of shot: the rest notwithstanding their ill dyet,\r\nand bad lodging, crowded in so small a Barge, in so many dangers never\r\nresting, but alwayes tossed to and againe, had all well recovered their\r\nhealths. The next day wee sayled so high as our Boat would float, there\r\nsetting up crosses, and graving our names in the trees. Our sentinell saw\r\nan arrow fall by him, though we had ranged up and downe more then an houre\r\nin digging in the earth, looking of stones, herbs, and springs, not seeing\r\nwhere a Salvage could well hide himself.\r\n\r\n               _Our fight with the Mannahocks._\r\n\r\n           _A Salvage shot and taken prisoner._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n            _His relation of their countries._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\n    _They cannot travell but where the woods are burnt._ [FN]\r\n\r\n    _How we concluded peace with the foure kings of Monahoke._ {MN-3}\r\n\r\nUpon the alarum by that we had recovered our armes, there was about an\r\nhundred nimble Indians skipping from tree to tree, letting fly their\r\narrows so fast as they could: the trees here served us for Baricadoes as\r\nwell as they. But Mosco did us more service then we expected, for having\r\nshot away his quiver of Arrowes, he ran to the Boat for more. The Arrowes\r\nof Mosco at the first made them pause upon the matter, thinking by his\r\nbruit and skipping, there were many Salvages. About halfe an houre this\r\ncontinued, then they all vanished as suddainly as they approached. Mosco\r\nvanished as suddenly as they approached. Mosco followed them so farre as\r\nhe could see us, till they were out of sight. {MN-1} As we returned there\r\nlay a Salvage as dead, shot in the knee, but taking him up we found he\r\n[III.63] had life, which Mosco seeing, never was Dog more furious against\r\na Beare, then Mosco was to have beat out his braines, so we had him to our\r\nBoat, where our Chirurgian who went with us to cure our Captaines hurt of\r\nthe Stingray, so dressed this Salvage that within an houre after he looked\r\nsomewhat chearefully, and did eate and speake. In the meane time we\r\ncontented Mosco in helping him to gather up their arrowes, which were an\r\narmefull, whereof he gloried not a little. Then we desired Mosco to know\r\nwhat he was, and what Countries were beyond the mountaines; the poore\r\nSalvage mildly answered, he and all with him were of Hasinninga, where\r\nthere are three Kings more, like unto them, namely the King of Stegora,\r\nthe King of Tauxuntania, and the King of Shakahonea, that were come to\r\nMohaskahod, which is onely a hunting Towne, and the bounds betwixt the\r\nKingdome of the Mannahocks, and the Nandtaughtacunds, but hard by where we\r\nwere. We demanded why they came in that manner to betray us, that came to\r\nthem in peace, and to seeke their loves; he answered, they heard we were a\r\npeople come from under the world, to take their world from them. {MN-2} We\r\nasked him how many worlds he did know, he replyed, he knew no more but His\r\nrelation of that which was under the skie that covered him, which were the\r\nPowhatans, with the Monacans, and the Massawomeks, that were higher up in\r\nthe mountaines. Then we asked him what was beyond the mountaines, he\r\nanswered the Sunne: but of any thing els he knew nothing; because the\r\nwoods were not burnt. [FN] These and many such questions wee demanded,\r\nconcerning the Massawomeks, the Monacans, their owne Country, and where\r\nwere the Kings of Stegora, Tauxsintania, and the rest. The Monacans he\r\nsayd were their neighbours and friends, and did dwell as they in the hilly\r\nCountries by small rivers, living upon rootes and fruits, but chiefly by\r\nhunting. The Massawomeks did dwell upon a great water, and had many boats,\r\n& so many men that they made warre with all the world. For their Kings,\r\nthey were gone every one a severall way with their men on hunting: But\r\nthose with him came thither a fishing till they saw us, notwithstanding\r\nthey would be altogether at night at Mahaskahod. For his relation we gave\r\nhim many toyes, with perswasions to goe with us, and he as earnestly\r\ndesired us to stay the comming of those Kings that for his good usage\r\nshould be friends with us, for he was brother to Hasinninga. But Mosco\r\nadvised us presently to be gone, for they were all naught, yet we told him\r\nwe would not till it was night. All things we made ready to entertain what\r\ncame, & Mosco was as diligent in trimming his arrowes. The night being\r\ncome we all imbarked, for the river was so narrow, had it beene light the\r\nland on the one side was so high, they might have done us exceeding much\r\nmischiefe. All this while the K. of Hasinninga was seeking the rest, and\r\nhad consultation a good time what to doe. But by their espies seeing we\r\nwere gone, it was not long before we heard their arrowes dropping on every\r\nside the Boat; we caused our Salvages to call unto them, but such a\r\nyelling & hallowing they made that they heard nothing, but now and then a\r\npeece, ayming so neare as we could where we heard the most voyces. More\r\nthen 12 myles they followed us in this manner; then the day appearing, we\r\nfound our selves in a broad Bay, out of danger of their shot, where wee\r\ncame to an anchor, and fell to breakfast. Not so much as speaking to them\r\ntill the Sunne was risen; being well refreshed, we untyed our Targets that\r\ncovered us as a Deck, and all shewed our selves with those shields on our\r\narmes, and swords in our hands, and also our prisoner Amoroleck; a long\r\ndiscourse there was betwixt his Countrimen and him, how good wee were,\r\nhow well wee used him, how wee had a Patawomek with us, loved us as his\r\nlife, that would have slain him had we not preserved him, and that he\r\nshould have his libertie would they be but friends; and to doe us any hurt\r\nit was impossible. {MN-3} Upon this they all hung their Bowes and Quivers\r\nupon the trees, and one came swimming aboord us with a bow tyed on his\r\nhead, and another with a Quiver of Arrowes, which they delivered our\r\nCaptaine as a present, the Captaine having used them so kindly as he\r\ncould, told them the other three Kings should doe the like, and then the\r\ngreat King of our world should be their friend, whose men we were. It was\r\nno sooner demanded but performed, so upon a low Moorish poynt [III.64.]\r\nof Land we went to the shore, where those foure Kings came and received\r\nAmoroleck: nothing they had but Bowes, Arrowes, Tobacco-bags, and Pipes:\r\nwhat we desired, none refused to give us, wondering at every thing we had,\r\nand heard we had done: our Pistols they tooke for pipes, which they much\r\ndesired, but we did content them with other Commodities, and so we left\r\nfoure or five hundred of our merry Mannahocks, singing, dauncing, and\r\nmaking merry, and set sayle for Moraughtacund.\r\n\r\n        _How we became friends with the Rapahanocks._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n              _The discovery of Payankatank._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nIn our returnes we visited all our friends, that rejoyced much at our\r\nVictory against the Mannahocks, who many times had Warres also with them,\r\nbut now they were friends, and desired we would be friends with the\r\nRapahanocks, {MN-1} as we were with the Mannahocks. Our Captaine told\r\nthem, they had twise assaulted him that came onely in love to doe them\r\ngood, and therefore he would now burne all their houses, destroy their\r\ncorne, and for ever hold them his enemies, till they made him\r\nsatisfaction; they desired to know what that should be: he told them they\r\nshould present him the Kings Bow and Arrowes, and not offer to come armed\r\nwhere he was; that they should be friends with the Moraughtacunds his\r\nfriends, and give him their Kings sonne in pledge to performe it, and then\r\nall King James his men should be their friends. Upon this they presently\r\nsent to the Rapahanocks to meete him at the place where they first fought,\r\nwhere would be the Kings of Nantautacund and Pissassac: which according to\r\ntheir promise were there so soone as we; where Rapahanock presented his\r\nBow and Arrowes, and confirmed all we desired, except his sonne, having no\r\nmore but him he could not live without him, but in stead of his sonne he\r\nwould give him the three women Moraughtacund had stolen. This was\r\naccepted: and so in three or foure Canowes, so many as could went with us\r\nto Moraughtacund, where Mosco made them such relations, and gave to his\r\nfriends so many Bowes and Arrowes, that they no lesse loved him then\r\nadmired us. The 3 women were brought our Captaine, to each he gave a\r\nchayne of Beads: and then causing Moraughtacund, Mosco, and Rapahanock\r\nstand before him, bid Rapahanock take her he loved best, and Moraughtacund\r\nchuse next, & to Mosco he gave the third. Upon this away went their\r\nCanowes over the water, to fetch their venison, and all the provision they\r\ncould, and they that wanted Boats swam over the river: the darke commanded\r\nus then to rest. The next day there was of men, women, and children, as we\r\nconjectured, six or seaven hundred, dauncing, & singing, and not a Bow nor\r\nArrow seene amongst them. Mosco changed his name Uttasantasough, which we\r\ninterpret Stranger, for so they call us. All promising ever to be our\r\nfriends, and to plant Corne purposely for us; and we to provide hatchets,\r\nbeads, and copper for them, we departed, giving them a Volley of shot, and\r\nthey us as loud shouts and cryes as their strengths could utter. {MN-2}\r\nThat night we anchored in the river of Payankatank, and discovered it so\r\nhigh as it was navigable, but the people were most a hunting, save a few\r\nold men, women, and children, that were tending their corne, of which they\r\npromised us part when we would fetch it, as had done all the Nations where\r\never we had yet beene.\r\n\r\nIn a fayre calme, rowing towards poynt Comfort, we anchored in Gosnolls\r\nBay, but such a suddaine gust surprised us in the night with thunder and\r\nrayne, that we never thought more to have seene James Towne. Yet running\r\nbefore the wind, we sometimes saw the Land by the flashes of fire from\r\nheaven, by which light onely we kept from the splitting shore, untill it\r\npleased God in that blacke darknesse to preserve us by that light to finde\r\npoynt Comfort: there refreshing our selves, because we had onely but heard\r\nof the Chisapeacks & Nandsamunds, we thought it as fit to know all our\r\nneighbours neare home, as so many Nations abroad.\r\n\r\n           _A notable trechery of the Nandsamunds._\r\n\r\n     _The fight with the Chisapeacks and Nandsamunds._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n            _How they became friends._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\n         _The proceeding at James towne._ {MN-3}\r\n\r\nSo setting sayle for the Southerne shore, we sayled up a narrow river up\r\nthe country of Chisapeack; it hath a good channell, but many shoules about\r\nthe entrance. By that we had sayled six or seaven myles, we saw two or\r\nthree little garden plots with their houses, the shore over-growne with\r\nthe greatest Pyne and Firre trees wee ever saw in the Country. But not\r\nseeing nor hearing any people, and the river very narrow, we returned to\r\nthe great river, to see if we could finde any of them. Coasting the shore\r\ntowards Nandsamund, which is most Oyster-bankes; [III.65] at the mouth of\r\nthat river, we espied six or seaven Salvages making their wires, who\r\npresently fled: ashore we went, and where they wrought we threw divers\r\ntoyes, and so departed. Farre we were not gone ere they came againe, and\r\nbegan to sing, and daunce, and recall us: and thus we began our first\r\nacquaintance. At last one of them desired us to goe to his house up that\r\nriver, into our Boat voluntarily he came, the rest ran after us by the\r\nshore with all shew of love that could be. Seaven or eight myles we sayled\r\nup this narrow river: at last on the Westerne shore we saw large\r\nCornefields, in the midst a little Isle, and in it was abundance of Corne;\r\nthe people he told us were all a hunting, but in the Isle was his house,\r\nto which he invited us with much kindnesse: to him, his wife, and\r\nchildren, we gave such things as they seemed much contented them. The\r\nothers being come, desired us also to goe but a little higher to see their\r\nhouses: here our host left us, the rest rowed by us in a Canow, till we\r\nwere so far past the Isle the river became very narrow. Here we desired\r\nsome of them to come abord us, wherat pausing a little, they told us they\r\nwould but fetch their bows and arrowes and goe all with us, but being\r\na-shore and thus armed, they perswaded us to goe forward, but we could\r\nneither perswade them into their Canow, nor into our Boat. This gave us\r\ncause to provide for the worst. Farre we went not ere seaven or eight\r\nCanowes full of men armed appeared following us, staying to see the\r\nconclusion. {MN-1} Presently from each side the river came arrowes so fast\r\nas two or three hundred could shoot them, whereat we returned to get the\r\nopen. They in the Canowes let fly also as fast, but amongst them we\r\nbestowed so many shot, the most of them leaped overboord and swam ashore,\r\nbut two or three escaped by rowing, being against their playnes: our\r\nMuskets they found shot further then their Bowes, for wee made not twentie\r\nshot ere they all retyred behind the next trees. Being thus got out of\r\ntheir trap, we seised on all their Canowes, and moored them in the midst\r\nof the open. More then an hundred arrowes stucke in our Targets, and about\r\nthe boat, yet none hurt, onely Anthony Bagnall was shot in his Hat, and\r\nanother in his sleeve. But seeing their multitudes, and suspecting as it\r\nwas, that both the Nandsamunds, and the Chisapeacks were together, we\r\nthought it best to ryde by their Canowes a while, to bethinke if it were\r\nbetter to burne all in the Isle, or draw them to composition, till we were\r\nprovided to take all they had, which was sufficient to feed all our\r\nColony: but to burne the Isle at night it was concluded. {MN-2} In the\r\ninterim we began to cut in peeces their Canowes, and they presently to lay\r\ndowne their bowes, making signes of peace: peace we told them we would\r\naccept, would they bring us their Kings bowes and arrowes, with a chayne\r\nof pearle; and when we came againe give us foure hundred baskets full of\r\nCorne, otherwise we would breake all their boats, and burne their houses,\r\nand corne, and all they had. To performe all this they alledged onely the\r\nwant of a Canow; so we put one a drift & bad them swim to fetch her: and\r\ntill they performed their promise, wee would but onely breake their\r\nCanowes. They cryed to us to doe no more, all should be as we would: which\r\npresently they performed, away went their bowes and arrowes, and tagge and\r\nragge came with their baskets: so much as we could carry we tooke, and so\r\ndeparting good friends, we returned to James Towne, where we safely\r\narrived the 7. of September, 1608. {MN-3} There we found Mr. Scrivener,\r\nand divers others well recovered: many dead; some sicke: the late\r\nPresident prisoner for mutiny: by the honest diligence of Master\r\nScrivener, the harvest gathered, but the provision in the store much\r\nspoyled with rayne. Thus was that summer (when little wanted) consumed and\r\nspent, and nothing done (such was the government of Captaine Ratliffe) but\r\nonely this discovery; wherein to expresse all the dangers, accidents, and\r\nincounters this small number passed in that small Barge, by the scale of\r\nproportion, about three thousand myles, with such watery dyet in those\r\ngreat waters and barbarous Countries (till then to any Christian utterly\r\nunknowne) I rather referre their merit to the censure of the courteous and\r\nexperienced Reader, then I would be tedious or partiall being a partie.\r\n\r\n      But to this place to come who will adventure, [III.66.]\r\n      With judgements guide and reason how to enter:\r\n      Finds in this worlds broad sea, with winde and tyde,\r\n    Ther's safer sayle then any where besides.\r\n      But 'cause to wanton novices it is\r\n      A Province full of fearefulnesse I wiss;\r\n      Into the great vast deepe to venter out:\r\n      Those shallow rivers let them coast about.\r\n      And by a small Boat learne their first, and marke,\r\n      How they may come to make a greater Barke.\r\n\r\n            Written by Anthony Bagnall, Nathanaell\r\n                  Powell, and Anas Todkill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          A.D. 1608.\r\n\r\n                         Chapter VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n           The Presidency surrendred to Captaine Smith:\r\n             the Arrivall and returne of the second Supply.\r\n             And what happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n             _Powhatans scorne when his courtesie was most\r\n               deserved._  {MN-1}\r\n\r\n             _No better way to overthrow the business then by\r\n               our instructors._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\n             _A consultation, where all the Councell was against\r\n               the President._ {MN-3}\r\n\r\n               _Capt. Smith goeth with 4. to Powhatan,\r\n                 when Newport feared with 120._ {MN-4}\r\n\r\nThe tenth of September, by the Election of the Councell, and request of\r\nthe Company, Captaine Smith received the Letters Patents: which till then\r\nby no meanes he would accept, though he was often importuned thereunto.\r\nNow the building of Ratliffes Pallace stayed as a thing needlesse; the\r\nChurch was repaired; the Store-house recovered; buildings prepared for the\r\nSupplyes we expected; the Fort reduced to a five-square forme; the order\r\nof the Watch renewed; the squadrons (each setting of the Watch) trained;\r\nthe whole Company every Saturday exercised, in the plaine by the west\r\nBulwarke, prepared for that purpose, we called Smithfield: where sometimes\r\nmore then an hundred Salvages would stand in an amazement to behold, how a\r\nfyle would batter a tree, where he would make them a marke to shoot at;\r\nthe boats trimmed for trade, which being sent out with Lieutenant Percy,\r\nin their Journey incountred the second Supply, that brought them backe to\r\ndiscover the Country of Monacan. How or why Captaine Newport obtained such\r\na private Commission, as not to returne without a lumpe of gold, a\r\ncertaintie of the South sea, or one of the lost company sent out by Sir\r\nWalter Raleigh, I know not; nor why he brought such a five peeced Barge,\r\nnot to beare us to that South sea, till we had borne her over the\r\nmountaines, which how farre they extend is yet unknowne. {MN-1} As for the\r\nCoronation of Powhatan, and his presents of Bason and Ewer, Bed, Bedstead,\r\nClothes, and such costly novelties, they had beene much better well spared\r\nthen so ill spent, for wee had his favour much better onely for a playne\r\npeece of Copper, till this stately kinde of soliciting, made him so much\r\novervalue himselfe, that he respected us as much as nothing at all. As for\r\nthe hyring of the Poles and Dutch-men, to make Pitch, Tar, Glasse, Milles,\r\nand Sope ashes, when the Country is replenished with people, and\r\nnecessaries, would have done well, but to send them and seaventie more\r\nwithout victualls to worke, was not so well advised nor considered of, as\r\nit should have beene. Yet this could not have hurt us had they beene 200.\r\nthough then we were 130 that wanted for our selves. For we had the\r\nSalvages in that decorum (their harvest being newly gathered,) that we\r\nfeared not to get victuals for 500. {MN-2} Now was there no way to make us\r\nmiserable, but to neglect that time to make provision whilst it was to be\r\nhad, the which was done by the direction from England to performe this\r\nstrange discovery, but a more strange Coronation to loose that time, spend\r\nthat victualls we had, tyre and starve our men, having no meanes to carry\r\nvictuals, munition, the hurt or sicke, but on their owne backes. How or by\r\nwhom they were invented I know not: but Captaine Newport we onely\r\naccounted the Author, who to effect these projects, had so guilded mens\r\nhopes with great promises, that both Company and Councell concluded his\r\nresolution for the most part: God doth know they little [III.67.] knew\r\nwhat they did, nor understood their owne estates to conclude his\r\nconclusions, against all the inconveniences the foreseeing President\r\nalledged. {MN-3} Of this Supply there was added to the Councell, one\r\nCaptaine Richard Waldo, and Captaine Wynne, two auncient Souldiers, and\r\nvaliant Gentlemen, but yet ignorant of the busines, (being but newly\r\narrived.) Ratliffe was also permitted to have his voyce, & Mr. Scrivener,\r\ndesirous to see strange Countries: so that although Smith was President,\r\nyet the Major part of the Councell had the authoritie and ruled it as they\r\nlisted. As for clearing Smiths objections, how Pitch and Tarre, Wainscot,\r\nClapbord, Glasse, and Sope ashes, could be provided, to relade the ship,\r\nor provision got to live withall, when none was in the Country, and that\r\nwe had, spent, before the ship departed to effect these projects. The\r\nanswer was, Captaine Newport undertooke to fraught the Pinnace of twentie\r\ntunnes with Corne in going and returning in his Discovery, and to\r\nrefraught her againe from Werowocomoco of Powhatan. Also promising a great\r\nproportion of victualls from the Ship; inferring that Smiths propositions\r\nwere onely devices to hinder his journey, to effect it himselfe; and that\r\nthe crueltie he had used to the Salvages, might well be the occasion to\r\nhinder these Designes, and seeke revenge on him. For which taxation all\r\nworkes were left, and 120 chosen men were appointed for Newports guard in\r\nthis Discovery. But Captaine Smith to make cleare all those seeming\r\nsuspitions, that the Salvages were not so desperate as was\r\npretended by Captaine Newport, and how willing (since by their authoritie\r\nthey would have it so) he was to assist them what he could, because the\r\nCoronation would consume much time, he undertooke himselfe their message\r\nto Powhatan, to intreat him to come to James Towne to receive his\r\npresents. {MN-4} And where Newport durst not goe with lesse then 120. he\r\nonely tooke with him Captaine Waldo, Mr. Andrew Buckler, Edward Brendon,\r\nand Samuel Collier: with these foure he went over land to Werowocomoco,\r\nsome 12 myles; there he passed the river of Pamaunkee in a Salvage Canow.\r\nPowhatan being 30 myles of, was presently sent for: in the meane time,\r\nPocahontas and her women entertained Captaine Smith in this manner.\r\n\r\n                     _A Virginia Maske._\r\n\r\nIn a fayre plaine field they made a fire, before which, he sitting upon a\r\nmat, suddainly amongst the woods was heard such a hydeous noise and\r\nshreeking, that the English betooke themselves to their armes, and seized\r\non two or three old men by them, supposing Powhatan with all his power was\r\ncome to surprise them. But presently Pocahontas came, willing him to kill\r\nher if any hurt were intended, and the beholders, which were men, women,\r\nand children, satisfied the Captaine there was no such matter. Then\r\npresently they were presented with this anticke; thirtie young women came\r\nnaked out of the woods, onely covered behind and before with a few greene\r\nleaves, their bodies all painted, some of one colour, some of another, but\r\nall differing, their leader had a fayre payre of Bucks hornes on her head,\r\nand an Otters skinne at her girdle, and another at her arme, a quiver of\r\narrowes at her backe, a bow and arrowes in her hand; the next had in her\r\nhand a sword, another a club, another a pot-sticke; all horned alike: the\r\nrest every one with their severall devises. These fiends with most hellish\r\nshouts and cryes, rushing from among the trees, cast themselves in a ring\r\nabout the fire, singing and dauncing with most excellent ill varietie, oft\r\nfalling into their infernall passions, and solemnly againe to sing and\r\ndaunce; having spent neare an houre in this Mascarado, as they entred in\r\nlike manner they departed.\r\n\r\n                  _The womens entertainment._\r\n\r\nHaving reaccommodated themselves, they solemnly invited him to their\r\nlodgings, where he was no sooner within the house, but all these Nymphes\r\nmore tormented him then ever, with crowding, pressing, and hanging about\r\nhim, most tediously crying, Love you not me? love you not me? This\r\nsalutation ended, the feast was set, consisting of all the Salvage dainties\r\nthey could devise: some attending, others singing and dauncing about them;\r\nwhich mirth being ended, with fire-brands in stead of Torches they\r\nconducted him to his lodging.\r\n\r\n    Thus did they shew their feats of armes, and others art in dauncing:\r\n    Some other us'd there oaten pipe, and others voyces chanting.\r\n\r\n                  _Captaine Smiths message._\r\n\r\nThe next day came Powhatan. Smith delivered his [III.68.] message of the\r\npresents sent him, and redelivered him Namontack he had sent for England,\r\ndesiring him to come to his Father Newport, to accept those presents, and\r\nconclude their revenge against the Monacans. Whereunto this subtile Savage\r\nthus replyed.\r\n\r\n                         _Powhatans answer._\r\n\r\nIf your King have sent me Presents, I also am a King, and this is my land:\r\neight dayes I will stay to receive them. Your Father is to come to me, not\r\nI to him, nor yet to your Fort, neither will I bite at such a bait: as for\r\nthe Monacans I can revenge my owne injuries, and as for Atquanachuk, where\r\nyou say your brother was slaine, it is a contrary way from those parts you\r\nsuppose it; but for any salt water beyond the mountaines, the Relations\r\nyou have had from my people are false. Whereupon he began to draw plots\r\nupon the ground (according to his discourse) of all those Regions. Many\r\nother discourses they had (yet both content to give each other content in\r\ncomplementall Courtesies) and so Captaine Smith returned with this Answer.\r\n\r\n                     _Powhatans Coronation._\r\n\r\nUpon this the Presents were sent by water which is neare an hundred myles,\r\nand the Captains went by land with fiftie good shot. All being met at\r\nWerowocomoco, the next day was appointed for his Coronation, then the\r\npresents were brought him, his Bason and Ewer, Bed and furniture set up,\r\nhis scarlet Cloke and apparell with much adoe put on him, being perswaded\r\nby Namontack they would not hurt him: but a foule trouble there was to\r\nmake him kneele to receive his Crowne, he neither knowing the majesty nor\r\nmeaning of a Crowne, nor bending of the knee, endured so many perswasions,\r\nexamples, and instructions, as tyred them all; at last by leaning hard on\r\nhis shoulders, he a little stooped, and three having the crowne in their\r\nhands put it on his head, when by the warning of a Pistoll the Boats were\r\nprepared with such a volley of shot, that the King started up in a\r\nhorrible feare, till he saw all was well. Then remembring himselfe, to\r\ncongratulate their kindnesse, he gave his old shooes and his mantell to\r\nCaptaine Newport: but perceiving his purpose was to discover the Monacans,\r\nhe laboured to divert his resolution, refusing to lend him either men or\r\nguides more then Namontack; and so after some small complementall\r\nkindnesse on both sides, in requitall of his presents he presented Newport\r\nwith a heape of wheat eares that might containe some 7 or 8 Bushels, and\r\nas much more we bought in the Towne, wherewith we returned to the Fort.\r\n\r\n                _The discovery of Monacan._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n         _How the Salvages deluded Cap. Newport._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nThe Ship having disburdened her selfe of 70 persons, with the first\r\nGentlewoman and woman servant that arrived in our Colony, Captaine Newport\r\nwith 120 chosen men, led by Captaine Waldo, Lieutenant Percie, Captaine\r\nWinne, Mr. West, and Mr. Scrivener, {MN-1} set forward for the discovery\r\nof Monacan, leaving the President at the Fort with about 80. or 90. (such\r\nas they were) to relade the Ship. Arriving at the Falles we marched by\r\nland some fortie myles in two dayes and a halfe, and so returned downe the\r\nsame path we went. Two townes we discovered of the Monacans, called\r\nMassinacak and Mowhemenchouch, the people neither used us well nor ill,\r\nyet for our securitie we tooke one of their petty Kings, and led him bound\r\nto conduct us the way. And in our returnes searched many places we\r\nsupposed Mines, about which we spent some time in refyning, having one\r\nWilliam Callicut, a refyner fitted for that purpose. From that crust of\r\nearth we digged, he perswaded us to beleeve he extracted some small\r\nquantitie of silver; and (not unlikely) better stuffe might be had for the\r\ndigging. With this poore tryall, being contented to leave this fayre,\r\nfertile, well watered Country; and comming to the Falles, the Salvages\r\nfayned there were divers ships come into the Bay, to kill them at James\r\nTowne. {MN-2} Trade they would not, and finde their Corne we could not;\r\nfor they had hid it in the woods: and being thus deluded, we arrived at\r\nJames Towne, halfe sicke, all complaining, and tyred with toyle, famine,\r\nand discontent, to have onely but discovered our guilded hopes, and such\r\nfruitlesse certainties, as Captaine Smith fortold us.\r\n\r\n    But those that hunger seeke to slake,\r\n    Which thus abounding wealth would rake:\r\n    Not all the gemmes of Ister shore,\r\n    Nor all the gold of Lydia's store,\r\n    Can fill their greedie appetite; [III.69.]\r\n    It is a thing so infinite.\r\n\r\n             _A punishment for swearing._ {MN}\r\n\r\nNo sooner were we landed, but the President dispersed so many as were\r\nable, some for Glasse, others for Tarre, Pitch, and Sope-ashes, leaving\r\nthem with the Fort to the Councels oversight, but 30 of us he conducted\r\ndowne the river some 5 myles from James towne, to learne to make Clapbord,\r\ncut downe trees, and lye in woods. Amongst, the rest he had chosen Gabriel\r\nBeadle, and John Russell, the onely two gallants of this last Supply, and\r\nboth proper Gentlemen. Strange were these pleasures to their conditions;\r\nyet lodging, eating, and drinking, working or playing, they but doing as\r\nthe President did himselfe. All these things were carried so pleasantly as\r\nwithin a weeke they became Masters: making it their delight to heare the\r\ntrees thunder as they fell; but the Axes so oft blistered their tender\r\nfingers, that many times every third blow had a loud othe to drowne the\r\neccho; {MN} for remedie of which sinne, the President devised how to have\r\nevery mans othes numbred, and at night for every othe to have a Cann of\r\nwater powred downe his sleeve, with which every offender was so washed\r\n(himselfe and all) that a man should scarce heare an othe in a weeke.\r\n\r\n  For he who scornes and makes but jests of cursings, and his othe,\r\n  He doth contemne, not man but God, nor God, nor man, but both.\r\n\r\n                    30. _Men better than_ 100. {MN}\r\n\r\nBy this, let no man thinke that the President and these Gentlemen spent\r\ntheir times as common Wood-haggers at felling of trees, or such other like\r\nlabours, or that they were pressed to it as hirelings, or common slaves;\r\nfor what they did, after they were but once a little inured, it seemed and\r\nsome conceited it, onely as a pleasure and recreation, {MN} yet 30 or 40\r\nof such voluntary Gentlemen would doe more in a day then 100 of the rest\r\nthat must be prest to it by compulsion, but twentie good workemen had\r\nbeene better then them all.\r\n\r\n            _The Chickahamania's forced to contribution._\r\n\r\nMaster Scrivener, Captaine Waldo, and Captaine Winne at the Fort, every\r\none in like manner carefully regarded their charge. The President\r\nreturning from amongst the woods, seeing the time consumed and no\r\nprovision gotten, (and the Ship lay idle at a great charge and did\r\nnothing) presently imbarked himselfe in the discovery barge, giving order\r\nto the Councell to send Lieutenant Percie after him with the next barge\r\nthat arrived at the Fort; two Barges he had himselfe and 18 men, but\r\narriving at Chickahamania, that dogged Nation was too well acquainted with\r\nour wants, refusing to trade, with as much scorne and insolency as they\r\ncould expresse. {MN} The President perceiving it was Powhatans policy to\r\nstarve us, told them he came not so much for their Corne, as to revenge\r\nhis imprisonment, and the death of his men murthered by them, and so\r\nlanding his men and readie to charge them, they immediately fled: and\r\npresently after sent their Ambassadors with corne, fish, foule, and what\r\nthey had to make their peace, (their Corne being that yeare but bad) they\r\ncomplained extreamely of their owne wants, yet fraughted our Boats with an\r\nhundred Bushels of Corne, and in like manner Lieutenant Percies, that not\r\nlong after arrived, and having done the best they could to content us, we\r\nparted good friends, and returned to James towne.\r\n\r\n                 _A bad reward for well-doing._\r\n\r\nThough this much contented the Company, (that feared nothing more then\r\nstarving) yet some so envied his good successe, that they rather desired\r\nto hazzard a starving, then his paines should prove so much more\r\neffectuall then theirs. Some projects there were invented by Newport and\r\nRatliffe, not onely to have deposed him, but to have kept him out of the\r\nFort; for that being President, he would leave his place and the Fort\r\nwithout their consents, but their hornes were so much too short to effect\r\nit, as they themselves more narrowly escaped a greater mischiefe.\r\n\r\n                    _A good Taverne in Virginia._\r\n\r\n            _A bad trade of the masters and saylers._ {MN}\r\n\r\nAll this time our old Taverne made as much of all them that had either\r\nmoney or ware as could be desired: by this time they were become so\r\nperfect on all sides (I meane the souldiers, saylers, and Salvages) as\r\nthere was tenne times more care to maintaine their damnable and private\r\ntrade, then to provide for the Colony things that were of necessary. {MN}\r\nNeither was it a small policy in Newport and the Marriners to report in\r\nEngland we had such plentie, and bring us so many men without victuals,\r\nwhen they had so many private Factors in the Fort, that within six or\r\nseaven weeks, of two or three hundred Axes, Chissels, Hows, and Pick-axes,\r\nscarce twentie could be found: and for Pike-heads, shot, Powder, or any\r\nthing they could steale from their fellowes, was vendible; they knew as\r\nwell (and as secretly) how to convey them to trade with the Salvages for\r\nFurres, Baskets, Mussaneeks, young Beasts, or such like Commodities, as\r\nexchange them with the Saylers for Butter, Cheese, Beefe, Porke,\r\nAquavitae, Beere, Bisket, Oatmeale, and Oyle: and then fayne all was sent\r\nthem from their friends. And though Virginia affoorded no Furres for the\r\nStore, yet one Master in one voyage hath got so many by this indirect\r\nmeanes, as he confessed to have sold in England for 30 L.\r\n\r\nThose are the Saint-seeming Worthies of Virginia, that have\r\nnotwithstanding all this meate, drinke, and wages; but now they begin to\r\ngrow weary, their trade being both perceived and prevented; none hath\r\nbeene in Virginia that hath observed any thing, which knowes not this to\r\nbe true, and yet the losse, the scorne, the misery, and shame, was the\r\npoore Officers, Gentlemen, and carelesse Governours, who were all thus\r\nbought & sold; the adventurers cousened, and the action overthrowne by\r\ntheir false excuses, informations, and directions. By this let all men\r\njudge, how this businesse could prosper, being thus abused by such\r\npilfring occasions. And had not Captaine Newport cryed Peccavi, the\r\nPresident would have discharged the ship, and caused him to have stayed\r\none yeare in Virginia, to learne to speake of his owne experience.\r\n\r\n              _Master Scriveners voyage to Werowocomoco._\r\n\r\nMaster Scrivener was sent with the Barges and Pinnace to Werowocomoco,\r\nwhere he found the Salvages more readie to fight then trade; but his\r\nvigilancy was such as prevented their projects, and by the meanes of\r\nNamontack got three or foure hogsheads of Corne, and as much Pocones,\r\nwhich is a red roote, which then was esteemed an excellent Dye.\r\n\r\nCaptaine Newport being dispatched, with the tryals of Pitch, Tarre,\r\nGlasse, Frankincense, Sope ashes; with that Clapboord and Waynscot that\r\ncould be provided: met with Mr. Scrivener at poynt Comfort, and so\r\nreturned for England. We remaining were about two hundred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Copy of a Letter sent to the Treasurer and\r\n     Councell of Virginia from Captaine Smith,\r\n     then President in Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\nRight Honorable, &c.\r\n\r\nI Received your Letter, wherein you write, that our minds are so set upon\r\nfaction, and idle conceits in dividing the Country without your consents,\r\nand that we feed You but with ifs & ands, hopes, & some few proofes; as if\r\nwe would keepe the mystery of the businesse to our selves: and that we\r\nmust expresly follow your instructions sent by Captain Newport: the charge\r\nof whose voyage amounts to neare two thousand pounds, the which if we\r\ncannot defray by the Ships returne, we are like to remain as banished men.\r\nTo these particulars I humbly intreat your Pardons if I offend you with my\r\nrude Answer.\r\n\r\nFor our factions, unlesse you would have me run away and leave the\r\nCountry, I cannot prevent them: because I do make many stay that would els\r\nfly any whether. For the idle Letter sent to my Lord of Salisbury, by the\r\nPresident and his confederats, for dividing the Country &c. What it was I\r\nknow not, for you saw no hand of [III.71] mine to it; nor ever dream't I\r\nof any such matter. That we feed you with hopes, &c. Though I be no\r\nscholer, I am past a schoole-boy; and I desire but to know, what either\r\nyou, and these here doe know, but that I have learned to tell you by the\r\ncontinuall hazard of my life. I have not concealed from you any thing I\r\nknow; but I feare some cause you to beleeve much more then is true.\r\n\r\nExpresly to follow your directions by Captaine Newport, though they be\r\nperformed, I was directly against it; but according to our Commission, I\r\nwas content to be over-ruled by the major part of the Councell, I feare to\r\nthe hazard of us all; which now is generally confessed when it is too\r\nlate. Onely Captaine Winne and Captaine Waldo I have sworne of the\r\nCouncell, and Crowned Powhatan according to your instructions.\r\n\r\nFor the charge of this Voyage of two or three thousand pounds, we have not\r\nreceived the value of an hundred pounds. And for the quartred Boat to be\r\nborne by the Souldiers over the Falles, Newport had 120 of the best men he\r\ncould chuse. If he had burnt her to ashes, one might have carried her in a\r\nbag, but as she is, five hundred cannot, to a navigable place above the\r\nFalles. And for him at that time to find in the South Sea, a Mine of gold;\r\nor any of them sent by Sir Walter Raleigh: at our Consultation I told them\r\nwas as likely as the rest. But during this great discovery of thirtie\r\nmyles, (which might as well have beene done by one man, and much more, for\r\nthe value of a pound of Copper at a seasonable tyme) they had the Pinnace\r\nand all the Boats with them, but one that remained with me to serve the\r\nFort. In their absence I followed the new begun workes of Pitch and Tarre,\r\nGlasse, Sope-ashes, and Clapboord, whereof some small quantities we have\r\nsent you. But if you rightly consider, what an infinite toyle it is in\r\nRussia and Swethland, where the woods are proper for naught els, and\r\nthough there be the helpe both of man and beast in those ancient\r\nCommonwealths, which many an hundred yeares have used it, yet thousands of\r\nthose poore people can scarce get necessaries to live, but from hand to\r\nmouth. And though your Factors there can buy as much in a week as will\r\nfraught you a ship, or as much as you please; you must not expect from us\r\nany such matter, which are but a many of ignorant miserable soules, that\r\nare scarce able to get wherewith to live, and defend our selves against\r\nthe inconstant Salvages: finding but here and there a tree fit for the\r\npurpose, and want all things els the Russians have. For the Coronation of\r\nPowhatan, by whose advice you sent him such presents, I know not; but this\r\ngive me leave to tell you, I feare they will be the confusion of us all\r\nere we heare from you againe. At your Ships arrivall, the Salvages harvest\r\nwas newly gathered, and we going to buy it, our owne not being halfe\r\nsufficient for so great a number. As for the two ships loading of Corne\r\nNewport promised to provide us from Powhatan, he brought us but foureteene\r\nBushels; and from the Monacans nothing, but the most of the men sicke and\r\nneare famished. From your Ship we had not provision in victuals worth\r\ntwenty pound, and we are more then two hundred to live upon this: the one\r\nhalfe sicke, the other little better. For the Saylers (I confesse) they\r\ndaily make good cheare, but our dyet is a little meale and water, and not\r\nsufficient of that. Though there be fish in the Sea, foules in the ayre,\r\nand Beasts in the woods, their bounds are so large, they so wilde, and we\r\nso weake and ignorant, we cannot much trouble them. Captaine Newport we\r\nmuch suspect to be the Authour of those inventions. Now that you should\r\nknow, I have made you as great a discovery as he, for lesse charge then he\r\nspendeth you every meale; I have sent you this Mappe of the Bay and\r\nRivers, with an annexed Relation of the Countries and Nations that inhabit\r\nthem, [III.72.] as you may see at large. Also two barrels of stones, and\r\nsuch as I take to be good Iron ore at the least; so devided, as by their\r\nnotes you may see in what places I found them. The Souldiers say many of\r\nyour officers maintaine their families out of that you send us: and that\r\nNewport hath an hundred pounds a yeare for carrying newes. For every\r\nmaster you have yet sent can find the way as well as he, so that an\r\nhundred pounds might be spared, which is more then we have all, that helpe\r\nto pay him wages. Cap. Ratliffe is now called Sicklemore, a poore\r\ncounterfeited imposture. I have sent you him home, least the company\r\nshould cut his throat. What he is, now every one can tell you: if he and\r\nArcher returne againe, they are sufficient to keepe us alwayes in\r\nfactions. When you send againe I intreat you rather send but thirty\r\nCarpenters, husbandmen, gardiners, fisher men, blacksmiths, masons, and\r\ndiggers up of trees, roots, well provided; then a thousand of such as we\r\nhave: for  except wee be able both to lodge them, and feed them, the most\r\nwill consume with want of necessaries before they can be made good for any\r\nthing. Thus if you please to consider this account, and of the unnecessary\r\nwages to Captaine Newport, or his ships so long lingering and staying here\r\n(for notwithstanding his boasting to leave us victuals for 12 moneths,\r\nthough we had 89 by this discovery lame and sicke, and but a pinte of\r\nCorne a day for a man, we were constrained to give him three hogs-heads of\r\nthat to victuall him homeward) or yet to send into Germany or Poleland for\r\nglasse-men & the rest, till we be able to sustaine our selves, and relieve\r\nthem when they come. It were better to give five hundred pound a tun for\r\nthose grosse Commodities in Denmarke, then send for them hither, till more\r\nnecessary things be provided. For in over-toyling our weake and unskilfull\r\nbodies, to satisfie this desire of present profit, we can scarce ever\r\nrecover our selves from one Supply to another. And I humbly intreat you\r\nhereafter, let us know what we should receive, and not stand to the\r\nSaylers courtesie to leave us what they please, els you may charge us with\r\nwhat you will, but we not you with any thing. These are the causes that\r\nhave kept us in Virginia, from laying such a foundation, that ere this\r\nmight have given much better content and satisfaction; but as yet you must\r\nnot looke for any profitable returnes: so I humbly rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Names of those in this Supply, were these:\r\n      with their Proceedings and Accidents.\r\n\r\n    Captaine Peter Winne, Captaine Richard Waldo,\r\n       were appoynted to be of the Councell.\r\n\r\n   Master Francis West, brother to the Lord La Warre.\r\n\r\n                    Gent.\r\n\r\n  Thomas Graves.

These people also\r\nlong denied him not onely the 400 Baskets of Corne they promised, but any\r\ntrade at all; (excusing themselves they had spent most they had, and were\r\ncommanded by Powhatan to keepe that they had, and not to let us come into\r\ntheir river) till we were constrained to begin with them perforce. Upon\r\nthe discharging of our Muskets they all fled and shot not an Arrow; the\r\nfirst house we came to we set on fire, which when they perceived, they\r\ndesired we would make no more spoyle, and they would give us halfe they\r\nhad: how they collected it I know not, but before night they loaded our\r\nthree Boats; and so we returned to our quarter some foure myles downe the\r\nRiver, which was onely the open woods under the lay of a hill, where all\r\nthe ground was covered with snow, and hard frozen; the snow we digged away\r\nand made a great fire in the place; when the ground was well dryed, we\r\nturned away the fire; and covering the place with a mat, there we lay very\r\nwarme. To keepe us from the winde we made a shade of another Mat; as the\r\nwinde turned we turned our shade, and when the ground grew cold we removed\r\nthe fire. And thus many a cold winter night have wee laine in this\r\nmiserable manner, yet those that most commonly went upon all those\r\noccasions, were alwayes in health, lusty, and fat. For sparing them this\r\nyeare, the next yeare they promised to plant purposely for us; and so we\r\nreturned to James towne. {MN} About this time there was a marriage betwixt\r\nJohn Laydon and Anne Burras; which was the first marriage we had in\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\n                    _Apamatuck discovered._ {MN}\r\n\r\nLong he stayed not, but fitting himselfe and Captaine Waldo with two\r\nBarges. From Chawopoweanock, and all parts thereabouts, all the people\r\nwere fled, as being jealous of our intents; {MN} till we discovered the\r\nriver and people of Apamatuck; where we found not much, that they had we\r\nequally divided, but gave them copper, and such things as contented them\r\nin consideration. Master Scrivener and Lieutenant Percie went also abroad,\r\nbut could find nothing.\r\n\r\nThe President seeing the procrastinating of time, was no course to live,\r\nresolved with Captaine Waldo (whom he knew to be sure in time of need) to\r\nsurprise Powhatan, and all his provision, but the unwillingnesse of\r\nCaptaine Winne, and Master Scrivener, for some private respect, plotted in\r\nEngland to ruine Captaine Smith, did their best to hinder their project;\r\nbut the President whom no perswasions could perswade to starve, being\r\ninvited by Powhatan to come unto him: and if he would send him but men to\r\nbuild him a house, give him a gryndstone, fiftie swords, some peeces, a\r\ncock and a hen, with much copper and beads, he would load his Ship with\r\nCorne. The President not ignorant of his devises and subtiltie, yet\r\nunwilling to neglect any opportunitie, presently sent three Dutch-men and\r\ntwo English, having so small allowance, few were able to doe any thing to\r\npurpose: knowing there needed no better a Castle to effect this project,\r\ntooke order with Captaine Waldo to second him, if need required; Scrivener\r\nhe left his substitute, and set forth with the Pinnace, two Barges, and\r\nfortie-six men, which onely were such as voluntarily offered themselves\r\nfor his Journey, the which by reason of Mr. Scriveners ill successe, was\r\ncensured very desperate, they all knowing Smith would not returne emptie,\r\nif it were to be had; howsoever, it caused many of those that he had\r\nappointed, to find excuses to stay behinde.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         A.D. 1608.\r\n\r\n                     Chap.

John Prat, George\r\nAcrig, James Read, Nicholas Hancock, James Watkins, Thomas Lambert, foure\r\nDutch-men, and Richard Salvage were sent by Land before to build the house\r\nfor Powhatan against our Arrivall.\r\n\r\n         _The good counsell of Warraskoyack._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThis company being victualled but for three or foure dayes, lodged the\r\nfirst night at Warraskoyack, where the President tooke sufficient\r\nprovision. This kind King did his best to divert him from seeing Powhatan,\r\nbut perceiving he could not prevaile, he advised in this manner. {MN}\r\nCaptaine Smith, you shall find Powhatan to use you kindly, but trust him\r\nnot, and be sure he have no oportunitie to seize on your Armes; for he\r\nhath sent for you onely to cut your throats. The Captaine thanking him for\r\nhis good counsell: yet the better to try his love, desired guides to\r\nChawwonock; for he would send a present to that King, to bind him his\r\nfriend. To performe this journey was sent Mr. Sicklemore, a very valiant,\r\nhonest, and a painefull Souldier: with him two guides, and directions how\r\nto seeke for the lost company of Sir Walter Raleighs, and silke Grasse.\r\nThen we departed thence, the President assuring the King perpetuall love;\r\nand left with him Samuel Collier his Page to learne the Language.\r\n\r\n    So this Kings deeds by sacred Oath adjur'd.\r\n    More wary proves, and circumspect by ods:\r\n    Fearing at least his double forfeiture;\r\n    To offend his friends, and sin against his Gods.\r\n\r\n                _Plentie of victualls._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n               148 _Foules killed at three shootes._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nThe next night being lodged at Kecoughtan; six or seaven dayes the\r\nextreame winde, rayne, frost and snow caused us to keepe Christmas among\r\nthe Salvages, {MN-1} where we were never more merry, nor fed on more\r\nplentie of good Oysters, Fish, Flesh, Wild-foule, and good bread; nor\r\nnever had better fires in England, then in the dry, smoaky houses of\r\nKecoughtan: but departing thence, when we found no houses we were not\r\ncurious in any weather to lye three or foure nights together under the\r\ntrees by a fire, as formerly is sayd. {MN-2} An hundred fortie eight\r\nfoules the President, Anthony Bagnall, and Serjeant Pising did kill at\r\nthree shoots. At Kiskiack the frost & contrary winds forced us three or\r\nfoure dayes also (to suppresse the insolency of those proud Salvages) to\r\nquarter in their houses, yet guard our Barge, and cause them give us what\r\nwe wanted; though we were but twelve and himselfe, yet we never wanted\r\nshelter where we found any houses. The 12 of January we arrived at\r\nWerowocomoco, where the river was frozen neare halfe a myle [III.75.] from\r\nthe shore; but to neglect no time, the President with his Barge so far had\r\napproached by breaking the ice, as the ebbe left him amongst those oasie\r\nshoules, yet rather then to lye there frozen to death, by his owne example\r\nhe taught them to march neere middle deepe, a flight shot through this\r\nmuddy frozen oase. When the Barge floated, he appoynted two or three to\r\nreturne her aboord the Pinnace. Where for want of water in melting the ice,\r\nthey made fresh water, for the river there was salt. But in this march Mr.\r\nRussell, (whom none could perswade to stay behinde) being somewhat ill,\r\nand exceeding heavie, so overtoyled himselfe as the rest had much adoe\r\n(ere he got ashore) to regaine life into his dead benummed spirits.\r\nQuartering in the next houses we found, we sent to Powhatan for provision,\r\nwho sent us plentie of bread, Turkies, and Venison; the next day having\r\nfeasted us after his ordinary manner, he began to aske us when we would be\r\ngone: fayning he sent not for us, neither had he any corne; and his people\r\nmuch lesse: yet for fortie swords he would procure us fortie Baskets. The\r\nPresident shewing him the men there present that brought him the message\r\nand conditions, asked Powhatan how it chanced he became so forgetfull;\r\nthereat the King concluded the matter with a merry laughter, asking for\r\nour Commodities, but none he liked without gunnes and swords, valuing a\r\nBasket of Corne more precious then a Basket of Copper; saying he could\r\nrate his Corne, but not the Copper.\r\n\r\n             _Cap. Smiths discourse to Powhatan._\r\n\r\nCaptaine Smith seeing the intent of this subtill Salvage began to deale\r\nwith him after this manner. Powhatan, though I had many courses to have\r\nmade my provision, yet beleeving your promises to supply my wants, I\r\nneglected all to satisfie your desire: and to testifie my love, I sent you\r\nmy men for your building, neglecting mine owne. What your people had you\r\nhave ingrossed, forbidding them our trade: and now you thinke by consuming\r\nthe time, we shall consume for want, not having to fulfill your strange\r\ndemands. As for swords and gunnes, I told you long agoe I had none to\r\nspare; and you must know those I have can keepe me from want: yet steale\r\nor wrong you I will not, nor dissolve that friendship we have mutually\r\npromised, except you constraine me by our bad usage.\r\n\r\n              _Powhatans reply and flattery._\r\n\r\nThe King having attentively listned to this Discourse, promised that both\r\nhe and his Country would spare him what he could, the which within two\r\ndayes they should receive. Yet Captaine Smith, sayth the King, some doubt\r\nI have of your comming hither, that makes me not so kindly seeke to\r\nrelieve you as I would: for many doe informe me, your comming hither is\r\nnot for trade, but to invade my people, and possesse my Country, who dare\r\nnot come to bring you Corne, seeing you thus armed with your men. To free\r\nus of this feare, leave aboord your weapons, for here they are needlesse,\r\nwe being all friends, and for ever Powhatans.\r\n\r\nWith many such discourses they spent the day, quartering that night in the\r\nKings houses. The next day he renewed his building, which hee little\r\nintended should proceede. For the Dutch-men finding his plentie, and\r\nknowing our want, and perceiving his preparations to surprise us, little\r\nthinking we could escape both him and famine; (to obtaine his favour)\r\nrevealed to him so much as they knew of our estates and projects, and how\r\nto prevent them. One of them being of so great a spirit, judgement, and\r\nresolution, and a hireling that was certaine of his wages for his labour,\r\nand ever well used both he and his Countrymen; that the President knew\r\nnot whom better to trust; and not knowing any fitter for that imployment,\r\nhad sent him as a spy to discover Powhatans intent, then little doubting\r\nhis honestie, nor could ever be certaine of his villany till neare halfe\r\na yeare after.\r\n\r\nWhilst we expected the comming in of the Country, we wrangled out of the\r\nKing ten quarters of Corne for a copper Kettell, the which the President\r\nperceiving him much to affect, valued it at a much greater rate; but in\r\nregard of his scarcity he would accept it, provided we should have as much\r\nmore the next yeare, or els the Country of Monacan. Wherewith each seemed\r\nwell contented, and Powhatan began to expostulate the difference of Peace\r\nand Warre after this manner.\r\n\r\n          _Powhatans discourse of peace and warre._\r\n\r\nCaptaine Smith, you may understand that I having seene the death of all\r\nmy people thrice, and not any one living of these three generations but my\r\nselfe; I know the difference of Peace and Warre better then any in my\r\nCountry. But now I am old and ere long must die, my [III.76.] brethren,\r\nnamely Opitchapam, Opechancanough, and Kekataugh, my two sisters, and\r\ntheir two daughters, are distinctly each others successors. I wish their\r\nexperience no lesse then mine, and your love to them no lesse then mine to\r\nyou. But this bruit from Nandsamund, that you are come to destroy my\r\nCountry, so much affrighteth all my people as they dare not visit you.\r\nWhat will it availe you to take that by force you may quickly have by\r\nlove, or to destroy them that provide you food. What can you get by warre,\r\nwhen we can hide our provisions and fly to the woods? whereby you must\r\nfamish by wronging us your friends. And why are you thus jealous of our\r\nloves seeing us unarmed, and both doe, and are willing still to feede you,\r\nwith that you cannot get but by our labours? Thinke you I am so simple,\r\nnot to know it is better to eate good meate, lye well, and sleepe quietly\r\nwith my women and children, laugh and be merry with you, have copper,\r\nhatchets, or what I want being your friend: then be forced to flie from\r\nall, to lie cold in the woods, feede upon Acornes, rootes, and such trash,\r\nand be so hunted by you, that I can neither rest, eate, nor sleepe; but my\r\ntyred men must watch, and if a twig but breake, every one cryeth there\r\ncommeth Captaine Smith: then must I fly I know not whether: and thus with\r\nmiserable feare, end my miserable life, leaving my pleasures to such\r\nyouths as you, which through your rash unadvisednesse may quickly as\r\nmiserably end, for want of that, you never know where to finde. Let this\r\ntherefore assure you of our loves, and every yeare our friendly trade\r\nshall furnish you with Corne; and now also, if you would come in friendly\r\nmanner to see us, and not thus with your guns and swords as to invade your\r\nfoes. To this subtill discourse, the President thus replyed.\r\n\r\n                 _Capt. Smiths reply._\r\n\r\nSeeing you will not rightly conceive of our words, we strive to make you\r\nknow our thoughts by our deeds; the vow I made you of my love, both my\r\nselfe and my men have kept. As for your promise I find it every day\r\nviolated by some of your subjects: yet we finding your love and kindnesse,\r\nour custome is so far from being ungratefull, that for your sake onely, we\r\nhave curbed our thirsting desire of revenge; els had they knowne as well\r\nthe crueltie we use to our enemies, as our true love and courtesie to our\r\nfriends. And I thinke your judgement sufficient to conceive, as well by\r\nthe adventures we have undertaken, as by the advantage we have (by our\r\nArmes) of yours: that had we intended you any hurt, long ere this we could\r\nhave effected it. Your people comming to James Towne are entertained with\r\ntheir Bowes and Arrowes without any exceptions; we esteeming it with you\r\nas it is with us, to weare our armes as our apparell. As for the danger of\r\nour enemies, in such warres consist our chiefest pleasure: for your riches\r\nwe have no use: as for the hiding your provision, or by your flying to the\r\nwoods, we shall not so unadvisedly starve as you conclude, your friendly\r\ncare in that behalfe is needlesse, for we have a rule to finde beyond your\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nMany other discourses they had, till at last they began to trade. But the\r\nKing seeing his will would not be admitted as a law, our guard dispersed,\r\nnor our men disarmed, he (sighing) breathed his minde once more in this\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n     _Powhatans importunity to have us unarmed to betray us._\r\n\r\nCaptaine Smith, I never use any Werowance so kindely as your selfe, yet\r\nfrom you I receive the least kindnesse of any. Captaine Newport gave me\r\nswords, copper, cloathes, a bed, towels, or what I desired; ever taking\r\nwhat I offered him, and would send away his gunnes when I intreated him:\r\nnone doth deny to lye at my feet, or refuse to doe what I desire, but\r\nonely you; of whom I can have nothing but what you regard not, and yet you\r\nwill have whatsoever you demand. Captaine Newport you call father, and so\r\nyou call me; but I see for all us both you will doe what you list, and we\r\nmust both seeke to content you. But if you intend so friendly as you say,\r\nsend hence your armes, that I may beleeve you; for you see the love I\r\nbeare you, doth cause me thus nakedly to forget my selfe.\r\n\r\nSmith seeing this Salvage but trifle the time to cut his throat, procured\r\nthe salvages to breake the ice, that his Boate might come to fetch his\r\ncorne and him: and gave order for more men to come on shore, to surprise\r\nthe King, with whom also he but trifled the time till his men were landed:\r\nand to keepe him from suspicion, entertained the time with this reply.\r\n\r\n      _Cap. Smiths discourse to delay time, till he found oportunity\r\n         to surprise the King._\r\n\r\nPowhatan you must know, as I have but one God, I honour but one King; and\r\nI live not here as your subject, but as your friend to pleasure you with\r\nwhat I can. By the gifts you bestow on me, you gaine more then by trade:\r\nyet would you visit mee as I doe you, you should know it is not our\r\ncustome, to sell our curtesies as a [III.77.] vendible commodity. Bring\r\nall your countrey with you for your guard, I will not dislike it as being\r\nover jealous. But to content you, to morrow I will leave my Armes, and\r\ntrust to your promise. I call you father indeed, and as a father you shall\r\nsee I will love you: but the small care you have of such a childe caused\r\nmy men perswade me to looke to my selfe.\r\n\r\n            _Powhatans plot to have murdered Smith._\r\n\r\n      _A chaine of pearls sent the Captaine for a present._ {MN}\r\n\r\nBy this time Powhatan having knowledge his men were ready whilest the ice\r\nwas a breaking, with his luggage women and children, fled. Yet to avoyd\r\nsuspicion, left two or three of the women talking with the Captaine,\r\nwhilest hee secretly ran away, and his men that secretly beset the house.\r\nWhich being presently discovered to Captaine Smith, with his pistoll,\r\nsword, and target hee made such a passage among these naked Divels; that\r\nat his first shoot, they next him tumbled one over another, and the rest\r\nquickly fled some one way some another: so that without any hurt, onely\r\naccompanied with John Russell, hee obtained the corps du guard. When they\r\nperceived him so well escaped, and with his eighteene men (for he had no\r\nmore with him a shore) to the uttermost of their skill they sought excuses\r\nto dissemble the matter: {MN} and Powhatan to excuse his flight and the\r\nsudden comming of this multitude, sent our Captaine a great bracelet and a\r\nchaine of pearle, by an ancient Oratour that bespoke us to this purpose,\r\nperceiving even then from our Pinnace, a Barge and men departing and\r\ncomming unto us.\r\n\r\nCaptaine Smith, our Werowance is fled, fearing your gunnes, and knowing\r\nwhen the ice was broken there would come more men, sent these numbers but\r\nto guard his corne from stealing, that might happen without your\r\nknowledge: now though some bee hurt by your misprision, yet Powhatan is\r\nyour friend and so will for ever continue. Now since the ice is open, he\r\nwould have you send away your corne, and if you would have his company,\r\nsend away also your gunnes, which so affrighteth his people, that they\r\ndare not come to you as hee promised they should.\r\n\r\n      _Pretending to kill our men loded with baskets, we caused\r\n                 them to do it themselves._\r\n\r\n         _Pocahontas betrays her fathers deceit to kill us._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThen having provided baskets for our men to carry our corne to the boats,\r\nthey kindly offered their service to guard our Armes, that none should\r\nsteale them. A great many they were of goodly well proportioned fellowes,\r\nas grim as Divels; yet the very sight of cocking our matches, and being to\r\nlet fly, a few wordes caused them to leave their bowes and arrowes to our\r\nguard, and beare downe our corne on their backes; wee needed not importune\r\nthem to make dispatch. But our Barges being left on the oase by the ebbe,\r\ncaused us stay till the next high-water, so that wee returned againe to\r\nour old quarter. Powhatan and his Dutch-men brusting with desire to have\r\nthe head of Captaine Smith, for if they could but kill him, they thought\r\nall was theirs, neglected not any oportunity to effect his purpose. The\r\nIndians with all the merry sports they could devise, spent the time till\r\nnight: then they all returned to Powhatan, who all this time was making\r\nready his forces to surprise the house and him at supper. Notwithstanding\r\nthe eternall all-seeing God did prevent him, and by a strange meanes. {MN}\r\nFor Pocahontas his dearest Jewell and daughter, in that darke night came\r\nthrough the irksome woods, and told our Captaine great cheare should be\r\nsent us by and by: but Powhatan and all the power he could make, would\r\nafter come kill us all, if they that brought it could not kill us with our\r\nowne weapons when we were at supper. Therefore if we would live shee\r\nwished us presently to bee gone. Such things as shee delighted in, he\r\nwould have given her: but with the teares running downe her cheekes, shee\r\nsaid shee durst not be seene to have any: for if Powhatan should know it,\r\nshe were but dead, and so shee ranne away by her selfe as she came. Within\r\nlesse then an hour came eight or ten lusty fellowes, with great platters\r\nof venison and other victuall, very importunate to have us put out our\r\nmatches (whose smoake made them sicke) and sit down to our victuall. But\r\nthe Captaine made them taste every dish, which done hee sent some of them\r\nbacke to Powhatan, to bid him make haste for hee was prepared for his\r\ncomming. As for them hee knew they came to betray him at his supper: but\r\nhee would prevent them and all their other intended villanies: so that\r\nthey might be gone. Not long after came more messengers, to see what\r\nnewes; not long after them others. Thus wee spent the night as vigilantly\r\nas they, till it was high-water, yet seemed to the salvages [III.78.] as\r\nfriendly as they to us: and that wee were so desirous to give Powhatan\r\ncontent, as hee requested, wee did leave him Edward Brynton to kill him\r\nfoule, and the Dutchmen to finish his house; thinking at our returne from\r\nPamaunkee the frost would be gone, and then we might finde a better\r\noportunity if necessity did occasion it, little dreaming yet of the\r\nDutch-mens treachery, whose humor well suted this verse:\r\n\r\n    Is any free, that may not live as freely as he list?\r\n    Let us live so, then w'are as free, and bruitish as the best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                A.D. 1608.\r\n\r\n                                Chap. IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 How wee escaped surprising at Pamaunkee.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _The Dutch men deceive Cap. Winne._\r\n\r\n        _The Dutch men furnish the Salvages with Armes._ {MN}\r\n\r\nWe had no sooner set sayle but Powhatan returned, and sent Adam and\r\nFrancis (two stout Dutch-men) to James towne: who faining to Captaine\r\nWinne that all things were well, and that Captaine Smith had use of their\r\narmes, wherefore they requested new (the which were given them) they told\r\nhim their comming was for some extraordinary tooles, and shift of\r\napparell; by which colourable excuse they obtained sixe or seaven more to\r\ntheir confederacie, such expert theeves, that presently furnished them\r\nwith a great many swords, pike-heads, peeces, shot, powder and such like:\r\nSalvages they had at hand to carry it away, and the next day they returned\r\nunsuspected, leaving their confederates to follow, and in the interim to\r\nconvay them such things as they could: for which service they should live\r\nwith Powhatan as his chiefe affected, free from those miseries that would\r\nhappen the Colony. {MN} Samuel their other consort Powhatan kept for their\r\npledge, whose diligence had provided them three hundred of their kinde of\r\nhatchets; the rest fifty swords, eight peeces, and eight pikes. Brynton\r\nand Richard Salvage seeing the Dutch-men so diligent to accommodate the\r\nSalvages with weapons, attempted to have gotten to James towne, but they\r\nwere apprehended, and expected ever when to be put to death.\r\n\r\nWithin two or three dayes we arrived at Pamaunkee, the King as many dayes\r\nentertained us with feasting and much mirth. And the day appointed to\r\nbeginne our trade, the President, Lieutenant Percie, Mr. West, Mr.\r\nRussell, Mr. Behethland, Mr. Crashaw, Mr. Powell, Mr. Ford, and some\r\nothers to the number of fifteene, went up to Opechancanoughs house (a\r\nquarter of a mile from the river) where wee found nothing but a lame\r\nfellow and a boy: and all the houses round about of all things abandoned.\r\nNot long wee stayed ere the King arrived, and after him came diverse of\r\nhis people loaden with bowes and arrowes: but such pinching commodities,\r\nand those esteemed at such a value, as our Captaine began with the King\r\nafter this manner.\r\n\r\n              _Smiths Speech to Opechancanough._\r\n\r\nOpechancanough, the great love you professe with your tongue, seemes meere\r\ndeceit by your actions. Last yeere you kindly fraughted our ship: but now\r\nyou have invited mee to starve with hunger: you know my want, and I your\r\nplenty; of which by some meanes I must have part: remember it is fit for\r\nKings to keepe their promise. Here are my commodities, whereof take your\r\nchoice, the rest I will proportion fit bargains for your people.\r\n\r\n       700. _Salvages beset the English being but_ 16. {MN}\r\n\r\nThe King seemed kindly to accept his offer, and the better to colour his\r\nproject, sold us what they had to our owne content, promising the next day\r\nmore company, better provided. The Barges and Pinnace being committed to\r\nthe charge of Mr. Phetiplace; the President with his old fifteene marched\r\nup to the Kings house, where wee found foure or five men newly arrived,\r\neach with a great basket. Not long after came the King, who with a\r\nstrained cheerfulnesse held us with discourse what paines he had taken to\r\nkeep his promise; {MN} till Mr. Russell brought us in newes that we were\r\nall betrayed: for at least seven hundred Salvages well armed, had\r\ninvironed [III.79.] the house, and beset the fields. The King conjecturing\r\nwhat Russell related, wee could well perceive how the extremity of his\r\nfeare betrayed his intent: whereat some of our company seeming dismaied\r\nwith the thought of such a multitude; the Captaine encouraged us to this\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n                   _Smiths speech to his Company._\r\n\r\nWorthy Countrey-men, were the mischiefes of my seeming friends no more\r\nthen the danger of these enemies, I little cared were they as many more:\r\nif you dare doe, but as I. But this is my torment, that if I escape them,\r\nour malicious Councell with their open mouthed Minions, will make me such\r\na peace-breaker (in their opinions in England) as will breake my necke. I\r\ncould wish those here, that make these seeme Saints, and me an oppressor.\r\nBut this is the worst of all, wherein I pray you aid mee with your\r\nopinions. Should wee beginne with them and surprise the King, we cannot\r\nkeepe him and defend well our selves. If wee should each kill our man, and\r\nso proceed with all in the house; the rest will all fly: then shall wee\r\nget no more then the bodies that are slaine, and so starve for victuall.\r\nAs for their fury it is the least danger, for well you know, being alone\r\nassaulted with two or three hundred of them, I made them by the helpe of\r\nGod compound to save my life. And wee are sixteene, and they but seaven\r\nhundred at the most; and assure your selves, God will so assist us, that\r\nif you dare stand but to discharge your pieces, the very smoake will bee\r\nsufficient to affright them. Yet howsoever, let us fight like men, and not\r\ndie like sheepe: for by that meanes you know God hath oft delivered mee,\r\nand so I trust will now. But first, I will deale with them, to bring it to\r\npasse wee may fight for something, and draw them to it by conditions. If\r\nyou like this motion, promise me you will be valiant.\r\n\r\nThe time not permitting any argument, all vowed to execute whatsoever hee\r\nattempted, or die: whereupon the Captaine in plaine tearmes told the King\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n                 _Smiths offer to Opechancanough._\r\n\r\nI see Opechancanough your plot to murder me, but I feare it not. As yet\r\nyour men and mine have done no harme, but by our direction. Take therefore\r\nyour Armes, you see mine, my body shall bee as naked as yours: the Isle in\r\nyour river is a fit place, if you be contented: and the conquerour (of us\r\ntwo) shall be Lord and Master over all our men. If you have not enough,\r\ntake time to fetch more, and bring what number you will; so every one\r\nbring a basket of corne, against all which I will stake the value in\r\ncopper, you see I have but fifteene, and our game shall be, the Conquerour\r\ntake all.\r\n\r\n             _Opechancanoughs device to betray Smith._\r\n\r\n               _Smith takes the King prisoner._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThe King being guarded with forty or fifty of his chiefe men, seemed\r\nkindly to appease Smiths suspicion of unkindnesse, by a great present at\r\nthe doore, they intreated him to receive. This was to draw him out of the\r\ndoore, where the bait was guarded with at least two hundred men, and\r\nthirty lying under a great tree (that lay thwart as a barricade) each his\r\narrow nocked ready to shoot. The President commanded one to go see what\r\nkind of deceit this was, and to receive the present; but hee refused to\r\ndoe it: yet the Gentlemen and all the rest were importunate to goe, but he\r\nwould not permit them, being vexed at that Coward: and commanded\r\nLieutenant Percie, Master West, and the rest to make good the house;\r\nMaster Powell and Master Behethland he commanded to guard the doore, {MN}\r\nand in such a rage snatched the King by his long locke in the middest of\r\nhis men, with his Pistoll readie bent against his brest. Thus he led the\r\ntrembling King, neare dead with feare amongst all his people: who\r\ndelivering the Captaine his Vambrace, Bow, and Arrowes, all his men were\r\neasily intreated to cast downe their Armes, little dreaming any durst in\r\nthat manner have used their King: who then to escape him-selfe bestowed\r\nhis presents in good sadnesse, and causing a great many of them come\r\nbefore him unarmed, holding the King by the hayre (as is sayd) he spake to\r\nthem to this effect.\r\n\r\n                  _Smiths discourse to the Pamaunkees._\r\n\r\nI see (you Pamaunkees) the great desire you have to kill me, and my long\r\nsuffering your injuries hath imboldened you to this presumption. The cause\r\nI have forborne your insolencies, is the promise I made you (before the\r\nGod I serve) to be your friend, till you give me just cause to be your\r\nenemy. If I keepe this vow, my God will keepe me, you cannot hurt me, if I\r\nbreake it, he will destroy me. But if you shoot but one Arrow to shed one\r\ndrop of bloud of any of my men, or steale the least of these Beads, or\r\nCopper, I spurne here before you with my foot; you shall see I will not\r\ncease revenge (if once I begin) so long as I can heare where to finde one\r\nof your Nation that will not deny the name [III.80.] of Pamaunk. I am not\r\nnow at Rassaweak halfe drowned with myre, where you tooke me prisoner; yet\r\nthen for keeping your promise and your good usage and saving my life, I so\r\naffect you, that your denyals of your trechery, doe halfe perswade me to\r\nmistake my selfe. But if I be the marke you ayme at, here I stand, shoot\r\nhe that dare. You promised to fraught my Ship ere I departed, and so you\r\nshall, or I meane to load her with your dead carcasses, yet if as friends\r\nyou will come and trade, I once more promise not to trouble you, except\r\nyou give me the first occasion, and your King shall be free and be my\r\nfriend, for I am not come to hurt him or any of you.\r\n\r\n             _The Salvages dissemble their intent._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                _Their excuse and reconcilement._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nUpon this away went their Bowes and Arrowes, and men, women, and children\r\nbrought in their Commodities: two or three houres they so thronged about\r\nthe President and so overwearied him, as he retyred himselfe to rest,\r\nleaving Mr. Behethland and Mr. Powell to receive their presents, {MN-1}\r\nbut some Salvages perceiving him fast asleepe, & the guard somewhat\r\ncarelesly dispersed, fortie or fiftie of their choise men each with a\r\nclub, or an English sword in his hand began to enter the house with two or\r\nthree hundred others, that pressed to second them. The noyse and hast they\r\nmade in, did so shake the house they awoke him from his sleepe, and being\r\nhalfe amazed with this suddaine sight, betooke him strait to his sword and\r\nTarget; Mr. Chrashaw and some others charged in like manner; whereat they\r\nquickly thronged faster backe then before forward. {MN-2} The house thus\r\ncleansed, the King and some of his auncients we kept yet with him, who\r\nwith a long Oration, excused this intrusion. The rest of the day was spent\r\nwith much kindnesse, the companie againe renewing their presents with\r\ntheir best provisions, and whatsoever he gave them they seemed therewith\r\nwell contented.\r\n\r\n         _The loss of Mr. Scrivener and others with a Skiff._\r\n\r\nNow in the meane while since our departure, this hapned at our Fort.\r\nMaster Scrivener having received Letters from England to make himselfe\r\neither Caesar or nothing, he began to decline in his affection to Captaine\r\nSmith, that ever regarded him as himselfe, and was willing to crosse the\r\nsurprising of Powhatan. Some certaine daies after the Presidents\r\ndeparture, he would needs goe visit the Isle of Hogs, and tooke with him\r\nCaptaine Waldo (though the President had appointed him to be ready to\r\nsecond his occasions) with Mr. Anthony Gosnoll and eight others; but so\r\nviolent was the wind (that extreame frozen time) that the Boat sunke, but\r\nwhere or how none doth know. The Skiff was much over loaden, and would\r\nscarce have lived in that extreame tempest had she beene empty: but by no\r\nperswasion he could be diverted, though both Waldo and an hundred others\r\ndoubted as it hapned. The Salvages were the first that found their bodies,\r\nwhich so much the more encouraged them to effect their projects. To\r\nadvertise the President of this heavie newes, none could be found would\r\nundertake it, but the Journey was often refused of all in the Fort, untill\r\nMaster Richard Wyffin undertooke alone the performance thereof.\r\n\r\n               _Master Wyffins desperate journey._\r\n\r\nIn this Journey he was incountred with many dangers and difficulties in\r\nall parts as he passed. As for that night he lodged with Powhatan,\r\nperceiving such preparation for warre, not finding the President there: he\r\ndid assure himselfe some mischiefe was intended. Pocahontas hid him for a\r\ntime, and sent them who pursued him the cleane contrary way to seeke him;\r\nbut by her meanes and extraordinary bribes and much trouble in three dayes\r\ntravell, at length he found us in the middest of these turmoyles. This\r\nunhappy newes the President swore him to conceale from the company, and so\r\ndissembling his sorrow with the best countenances he could, when the night\r\napproched went safely aboord with all his Souldiers; leaving\r\nOpechancanough at libertie, according to his promise, the better to have\r\nPowhatan in his returne.\r\n\r\n               _Powhatan constraineth his men to be trecherous._\r\n\r\n                 _The third attempt to betray us._ {MN}\r\n\r\nNow so extreamely Powhatan had threatned the death of his men, if they\r\ndid not by some meanes kill Captaine Smith: that the next day they\r\nappointed all the countrey should come to trade unarmed: yet unwilling to\r\nbe trecherous, but that they were constrained, hating fighting with him\r\nalmost as ill as hanging, such feare they had of bad successe. The next\r\nmorning the Sunne had not long appeared, but the fields appeared covered\r\nwith people and Baskets, to tempt us on shore: but nothing was to be had\r\nwithout his presence, nor they would not indure the sight of a gun.\r\n{MN} When the President saw them begin to [III.81.] depart, being\r\nunwilling to loose such a bootie, he so well contrived the Pinnace, and\r\nhis Barges with Ambuscadoes, as onely with Lieutenant Percie, Mr. West,\r\nand Mr. Russell, with their Armes went on shore; others he appointed\r\nunarmed to receive what was brought. The Salvages flocked before him in\r\nheapes, and the banke serving as a trench for a retreat, he drew them\r\nfayre open to his Ambuscado's. For he not being to be perswaded to goe\r\nvisit their King, the King knowing the most of them unarmed, came to visit\r\nhim with two or three hundred men, in the forme of two halfe Moones; and\r\nwith some twentie men, and many women loaden with painted Baskets. But\r\nwhen they approached somewhat neare us, their women and children fled. For\r\nwhen they had environed and beset the fields in this manner, they thought\r\ntheir purpose sure, yet so trembled with feare as they were scarse able to\r\nnock their Arrowes: Smith standing with his three men ready bent,\r\nbeholding them till they were within danger of our Ambuscado's, who upon\r\nthe word discovered themselves, and he retyred to the Barge. Which the\r\nSalvages no sooner perceived, then away they fled, esteeming their heeles\r\nfor their best advantage.\r\n\r\nThat night we sent Mr. Chrashaw, and Mr. Ford to James towne to Cap.\r\nWinne. In the way betweene Werowocomoco and the Fort they met foure or\r\nfive of the Dutchmens Confederates going to Powhatan: the which to excuse\r\nthose Gentlemens suspition of their running to the Salvages, returned to\r\nthe Fort and there continued.\r\n\r\n             _A chayne of pearle sent to obtaine peace._\r\n\r\nThe Salvages hearing our Barge goe downe the river in the night, were so\r\nterribly affrayde, that we sent for more men (we having so much threatned\r\ntheir ruine, and the rasing of their houses, boats, and wires) that the\r\nnext day the King sent our Captaine a chayne of Pearle, to alter his\r\npurpose and stay his men: promising though they wanted themselves, to\r\nfraught our ship and bring it aboord to avoyd suspition. So that five or\r\nsix dayes after, from all parts of the Country within ten or twelve myles\r\nin the extreame frost and snow, they brought us provision on their naked\r\nbackes.\r\n\r\n          _The President poysened: the offender punished._\r\n\r\n              _The Salvages want and povertie._ {MN}\r\n\r\nYet notwithstanding this kindnesse and trade, had their art and poyson\r\nbeene sufficient, the President, with Mr. West, and some others had beene\r\npoysoned; it made them sicke, but expelled it selfe. Wecuttanow, a stout\r\nyoung fellow, knowing he was suspected for bringing this present of\r\npoyson, with fortie or fiftie of his chiefe companions (seeing the\r\nPresident but with a few men at Potauncak) so proudly braved it, as though\r\nhe expected to incounter a revenge. Which the President perceiving in the\r\nmidst of his company, did not onely beate, but spurned him like a dogge,\r\nas scorning to doe him any worse mischiefe. Whereupon all of them fled\r\ninto the woods, thinking they had done a great matter to have so well\r\nescaped: and the townsmen remaining presently fraughted our Barge to be\r\nrid of our companies, framing many excuses to excuse Wecuttanow, (being\r\nsonne to their chiefe King, but Powhatan) and told us if we would shew\r\nthem him that brought the poyson, they would deliver him to us to punish\r\nas we pleased. Men may thinke it strange there should be such a stirre for\r\na little corne, but had it beene gold with more ease wee might have got\r\nit; and had it wanted, the whole Colony had starved. Wee may be thought\r\nvery patient to endure all those injuries, yet onely with fearing them wee\r\ngot what they had. Whereas if we had taken revenge, then by their losse,\r\nwe should have lost our selves. {MN} We searched also the Countries of\r\nYoughtanund and Mattapanient, where the people imparted that little they\r\nhad with such complaints and teares from the eyes of women and children,\r\nas he had beene too cruell to have beene a Christian, that would not have\r\nbeene satisfied and moved with compassion. But had this hapned in October,\r\nNovember, and December, when that unhappie discovery of Monacan was made,\r\nwe might have fraughted a ship of fortie tuns, and twise as much might\r\nhave beene had from the Rivers of Rapahanock, Patawomek, and Pawtuxunt.\r\n\r\n              _The Dutch-men did much hurt._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThe maine occasion of our thus temporizing with them was, to part friends\r\nas we did, to give the lesse cause of suspition to Powhatan to fly,\r\nby whom we now returned [III.82.] with a purpose to have surprised him and\r\nhis provision. For effecting whereof (when we came against the Towne) the\r\nPresident sent Mr. Wyffin and Mr. Coe ashore to discover and make way for\r\nhis intended project. {MN} But they found that those damned Dutch-men had\r\ncaused Powhatan to abandon his new house and Werowocomoco, and to carry\r\naway all his corne and provision: and the people they found so ill\r\naffected, that they were in great doubt how to escape with their lives. So\r\nthe President finding his intent frustrated, and that there was nothing\r\nnow to be had, and therefore an unfit time to revenge their abuses, sent\r\nMaster Michael Phittiplace by Land to James towne, whether we sayled with\r\nall the speed we could; wee having in this Journey (for 25 L. of Copper,\r\nand 50 L. of Iron & Beads) enough to keepe 46 men six weekes, and every\r\nman for his reward a moneths provision extraordinary (no Trade being\r\nallowed but for the store) we got neare 200 L. waight of deere suet, and\r\ndelivered to the Cape Merchant 479 Bushels of Corne.\r\n\r\nThose temporizing proceedings to some may seeme too charitable, to such a\r\ndaily daring trecherous people: to others not pleasing, that we washed not\r\nthe ground with their blouds, nor shewed such strange inventions in\r\nmangling, murdering, ransacking, and destroying (as did the Spanyards) the\r\nsimple bodies of such ignorant soules; nor delightfull, because not\r\nstuffed with Relations of heapes and mynes of gold and silver, nor such\r\nrare commodities, as the Portugals and Spanyards found in the East and\r\nWest Indies. The want whereof hath begot us (that were the first\r\nundertakers) no lesse scorne and contempt, then the noble conquests and\r\nvaliant adventures beautified with it, prayse and honour. Too much I\r\nconfesse the world cannot attribute to their ever memorable merit: and to\r\ncleare us from the blind worlds ignorant censure, these few words may\r\nsuffice any reasonable understanding.\r\n\r\n               _An Apology for the first Planters._\r\n\r\nIt was the Spanyards good hap to happen in those parts where were infinite\r\nnumbers of people, who had manured the ground with that providence, it\r\naffoorded victualls at all times. And time had brought them to that\r\nperfection, they had the use of gold and silver, and the most of such\r\ncommodities as those Countries affoorded: so that what the Spanyard got\r\nwas chiefely the spoyle and pillage of those Countrey people, and not the\r\nlabours of their owne hands. But had those fruitfull Countries beene as\r\nsalvage, as barbarous, as ill peopled, as little planted, laboured, and\r\nmanured, as Virginia: their proper labours it is likely would have\r\nproduced as small profit as ours. But had Virginia beene peopled, planted,\r\nmanured, and adorned with such store of precious Jewels, and rich\r\ncommodities as was the Indies: then had we not gotten and done as much as\r\nby their examples might be expected from us, the world might then have\r\ntraduced us and our merits, and have made shame and infamy our recompence\r\nand reward.\r\n\r\nBut we chanced in a Land even as God made it, where we found onely an\r\nidle, improvident, scattered people, ignorant of the knowledge of gold or\r\nsilver, or any commodities, and carelesse of any thing but from hand to\r\nmouth, except babies of no worth; nothing to incourage us, but what\r\naccidentally we found Nature afforded. Which ere we could bring to\r\nrecompence our paines, defray our charges, and satisfie our Adventurers;\r\nwe were to discover the Countrey, subdue the people, bring them to be\r\ntractable, civill, and industrious, and teach them trades, that the fruits\r\nof their labours might make us some recompence, or plant such Colonies of\r\nour owne, that must first make provision how to live of themselves, ere\r\nthey can bring to perfection the commodities of the Country: which\r\ndoubtlesse will be as commodious for England as the west Indies for\r\nSpaine, if it be rightly mannaged: notwithstanding all our home-bred\r\nopinions, that will argue the contrary, as formerly some have done against\r\nthe Spanyards and Portugalls. But to conclude, against all rumor of\r\nopinion, I onely say this, for those that the three first yeares began\r\nthis Plantation; notwithstanding all their factions, mutinies, and\r\nmiseries, so gently corrected, and well prevented: peruse the Spanish\r\nDecades; the Relations of Master Hackluit, and tell me how many ever with\r\nsuch small meanes as a Barge of 22 tuns, sometimes with seaven, eight, or\r\nnine, or but at most, twelve or sixteene men, did ever discover so many\r\nfayre and navigable Rivers, subject so many severall [III.83.] Kings,\r\npeople, and Nations, to obedience, and contribution, with so little\r\nbloudshed.\r\n\r\nAnd if in the search of those Countries we had hapned where wealth had\r\nbeene, we had as surely had it as obedience and contribution, but if we\r\nhave overskipped it, we will not envie them that shall find it: yet can we\r\nnot but lament, it was our fortunes to end when we had but onely learned\r\nhow to begin, and found the right course how to proceed.\r\n\r\n           By Richard Wyffin, William Phittiplace, Jeffrey\r\n                      Abbot, and Anas Todkill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               A.D. 1608.\r\n\r\n                                Chap. X.\r\n\r\n\r\n               How the Salvages became subject to the English.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Ships departed, all the provision of the Store (but that the\r\nPresident had gotten) was so rotten with the last Summers rayne, and eaten\r\nwith Rats and Wormes, as the Hogges would scarcely eate it. Yet it was the\r\nSouldiers dyet till our returnes, so that we found nothing done, but our\r\nvictuals spent, and the most part of our tooles, and a good part of our\r\nArmes conveyed to the Salvages. But now casting up the Store, and finding\r\nsufficient till the next harvest, the feare of starving was abandoned, and\r\nthe company divided into tens, fifteens, or as the businesse required; six\r\nhoures each day was spent in worke, the rest in Pastime and merry\r\nexercises, but the untowardnesse of the greatest number caused the\r\nPresident advise as followeth.\r\n\r\n             _The Presidents advice to the Company._\r\n\r\nCountrymen, the long experience of our late miseries, I hope is sufficient\r\nto perswade every one to a present correction of himselfe, and thinke not\r\nthat either my pains, nor the Adventurers purses, will ever maintaine you\r\nin idlenesse and sloath. I speake not this to you all, for divers of you I\r\nknow deserve both honour and reward, better then is yet here to be had:\r\nbut the greater part must be more industrious, or starve, how ever you\r\nhave beene heretofore tollerated by the authoritie of the Councell, from\r\nthat I have often commanded you. You see now that power resteth wholly in\r\nmy selfe: you must obey this now for a Law, that he that will not worke\r\nshall not eate (except by sicknesse he be disabled:) for the labours of\r\nthirtie or fortie honest and industrious men shall not be consumed to\r\nmaintaine an hundred and fiftie idle loyterers. And though you presume the\r\nauthoritie here is but a shadow, and that I dare not touch the lives of\r\nany but my owne must answer it: the Letters patents shall each weeke be\r\nread to you, whose Contents will tell you the contrary. I would wish you\r\ntherefore without contempt seeke to observe these orders set downe, for\r\nthere are now no more Counsellers to protect you, nor curbe my endevours.\r\nTherefore he that offendeth, let him assuredly expect his due punishment.\r\n\r\nHe made also a Table, as a publicke memoriall of every mans deserts, to\r\nincourage the good, and with shame to spurre on the rest to amendment. By\r\nthis many became very industrious, yet more by punishment performed their\r\nbusinesse, for all were so tasked, that there was no excuse could prevaile\r\nto deceive him: yet the Dutch-mens consorts so closely convayed them\r\npowder, shot, swords, and tooles, that though we could find the defect, we\r\ncould not finde by whom, till it was too late.\r\n\r\n           _The Dutch-men plot to murther Cap. Smith._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n         _Smith taketh the King of Paspahegh prisoner._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nAll this time the Dutch men remaining with Powhatan, (who kindly\r\nentertained them to instruct the Salvages the use of our Armes) and their\r\nconsorts not following them as they expected; {MN-1} to know the cause,\r\nthey sent Francis their companion, a stout young fellow, disguised like a\r\nSalvage, to the Glasse-house, a place in the woods neare a myle from James\r\nTowne; where was their Rendezvous for all their unsuspected villany.\r\nFortie men they procured to lie in Ambuscado for Captaine Smith, who no\r\nsooner heard of this Dutch-man, but he sent to apprehend him (but he was\r\ngone) yet to crosse his returne to Powhatan, the Captaine presently\r\ndispatched 20. shot [III.84.] after him, himselfe returning from the\r\nGlasse-house alone. By the way he incountred the King of Paspahegh, a most\r\nstrong stout Salvage, whose perswasions not being able to perswade him to\r\nhis Ambush, seeing him onely armed but with a faucheon, attempted to have\r\nshot him, but the President prevented his shoot by grapling with him, and\r\nthe Salvage as well prevented him for drawing his faucheon, and perforce\r\nbore him into the River to have drowned him. {MN-2} Long they strugled in\r\nthe water, till the President got such hold on his throat, he had neare\r\nstrangled the King; but having drawne his faucheon to cut off his head,\r\nseeing how pittifully he begged his life, he led him prisoner to James\r\nTowne, and put him in chaynes.\r\n\r\n           _Cap. Smith taketh two Salvages prisoners._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThe Dutch-man ere long was also brought in, whose villany though all this\r\ntime it was suspected, yet he fayned such a formall excuse, that for want\r\nof language Captaine Winne understood him not rightly, and for their\r\ndealings with Powhatan, that to save their lives they were constrained to\r\naccommodate his armes, of whom he extreamely complained to have detained\r\nthem perforce, and that he made this escape with the hazard of his life,\r\nand meant not to have returned, but was onely walking in the woods to\r\ngather Walnuts. Yet for all this faire tale, there was so small appearance\r\nof truth, and the plaine confession of Paspahegh of his trechery, he went\r\nby the heeles: Smith purposing; to regaine the Dutch-men, by the saving\r\nhis life. The poore Salvage did his best by his daily messengers to\r\nPowhatan, but all returned that the Dutch-men would not returne, neither\r\ndid Powhatan stay them; and to bring them fiftie myles on his mens backes\r\nthey were not able. Daily this Kings wives, children, and people came to\r\nvisit him with presents, which he liberally bestowed to make his peace.\r\nMuch trust they had in the Presidents promise: but the King finding his\r\nguard negligent, though fettered yet escaped. Captaine Winne thinking to\r\npursue him found such troupes of Salvages to hinder his passage, as they\r\nexchanged many vollies of shot for flights of Arrowes. {MN} Captaine Smith\r\nhearing of this in returning to the Fort, tooke two Salvages prisoners,\r\ncalled Kemps and Tussore, the two most exact villaines in all the Country.\r\nWith these he sent Captaine Winne and fiftie choise men, and Lieutenant\r\nPercie, to have regained the King, and revenged this injury, and so had\r\ndone, if they had followed his directions, or beene advised with those two\r\nvillaines, that would have betrayed both King & kindred for a peece of\r\nCopper, but he trifling away the night, the Salvages the next morning by\r\nthe rising of the Sunne, braved him to come ashore to fight: a good time\r\nboth sides let fly at other, but we heard of no hurt, onely they tooke two\r\nCanowes, burnt the Kings house, and so returned to James towne.\r\n\r\n                    _The Salvages desire peace._\r\n\r\nThe President fearing those Bravado's would but incourage the Salvages,\r\nbegan againe himselfe to try his conclusions, whereby six or seaven were\r\nslaine, as many made prisoners. He burnt their houses, tooke their Boats,\r\nwith all their fishing wires, and planted some of them at James towne for\r\nhis owne use, and now resolved not to cease till he had revenged himselfe\r\nof all them had injured him. But in his journey passing by Paspahegh\r\ntowards Chickahamania, the Salvages did their best to draw him to their\r\nAmbuscadoes; but seeing him regardlesly passe their Country, all shewed\r\nthemselves in their bravest manner. To try their valours he could not but\r\nlet fly, and ere he could land, they no sooner knew him, but they threw\r\ndowne their armes and desired peace. Their Orator was a lustie young\r\nfellow called Okaning, whose worthy discourse deserveth to be remembred.\r\nAnd thus it was:\r\n\r\n                      _Okaning his Oration._\r\n\r\nCaptaine Smith, my Master is here present in the company, thinking it\r\nCapt. Winne, and not you, (of him he intended to have beene revenged)\r\nhaving never offended him. If he hath offended you in escaping your\r\nimprisonment, the fishes swim, the foules fly, and the very beasts strive\r\nto escape the snare and live. Then blame not him being a man. He would\r\nintreat you remember, you being a prisoner, what paines he tooke to save\r\nyour life. If since he hath injured you he was compelled to it: but\r\nhowsoever, you have revenged it with our too great losse. We perceive and\r\nwell know you intend to destroy us, that are here to intreat and desire\r\nyour friendship, and to enjoy our houses and plant our fields, of whose\r\nfruit you shall participate: otherwise you will have the worse by our\r\nabsence; for we can plant any where, though [III.85] with more labour, and\r\nwe know you cannot live if you want our harvest, and that reliefe we bring\r\nyou. If you promise us peace, we will beleeve you; if you proceed in\r\nrevenge we will abandon the Country.\r\n\r\nUpon these tearmes the President promised them peace, till they did us\r\ninjury, upon condition they should bring in provision. Thus all departed\r\ngood friends, and so continued till Smith left the Countrey.\r\n\r\n         _A Salvage smoothered at James towne, and recovered._\r\n\r\nArriving at James Towne, complaint was made to the President, that the\r\nChickahamanians, who all this while continued trade and seemed our\r\nfriends, by colour thereof were the onely theeves. And amongst other\r\nthings a Pistoll being stolne and the theefe fled, there was apprehended\r\ntwo proper young fellowes, that were brothers, knowne to be his\r\nconfederates. Now to regaine this Pistoll, the one was imprisoned, the\r\nother was sent to returne the Pistoll againe within twelve houres, or his\r\nbrother to be hanged. Yet the President pittying the poore naked Salvage\r\nin the dungeon, sent him victuall and some Char-coale for a fire: ere\r\nmidnight his brother returned with the Pistoll, but the poore Salvage in\r\nthe dungeon was so smoothered with the smoake he had made, and so\r\npittiously burnt, that wee found him dead. The other most lamentably\r\nbewayed his death, and broke forth into such bitter agonies, that the\r\nPresident to quiet him, told him that if hereafter they would not steale,\r\nhe would make him alive againe: but he little thought he could be\r\nrecovered. Yet we doing our best with Aqua vitae and Vineger, it pleased\r\nGod to restore him againe to life, but so drunke & affrighted, that he\r\nseemed Lunaticke, the which as much tormented and grieved the other, as\r\nbefore to see him dead. Of which maladie upon promise of their good\r\nbehaviour, the President promised to recover him: and so caused him to be\r\nlayd by a fire to sleepe, who in the morning having well slept, had\r\nrecovered his perfect senses, and then being dressed of his burning, and\r\neach a peece of Copper given them, they went away so well contented, that\r\nthis was spread among all the Salvages for a miracle, that Captaine Smith\r\ncould make a man alive that was dead.\r\n\r\n          _Two or three Salvages slaine in drying Powder._\r\n\r\nAnother ingenuous Salvage of Powhatans, having gotten a great bag of\r\nPowder, and the backe of an Armour, at Werowocomoco amongst a many of his\r\ncompanions, to shew his extraordinary skill, he did dry it on the backe as\r\nhe had seene the Souldiers at James Towne. But he dryed it so long, they\r\npeeping over it to see his skill, it tooke fire, and blew him to death,\r\nand one or two more, and the rest so scorched, they had little pleasure to\r\nmeddle any more with powder.\r\n\r\nThese and many other such pretty Accidents, so amazed and affrighted both\r\nPowhatan, and all his people, that from all parts with presents they\r\ndesired peace; returning many stolne things which we never demanded nor\r\nthought of; and after that, those that were taken stealing, both Powhatan\r\nand his people have sent them backe to James towne, to receive their\r\npunishment; and all the Country became absolute as free for us, as for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Chap. XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  What was done in three moneths having Victualls. The Store devoured by\r\n    Rats, how we lived three moneths of such naturall fruits as the\r\n    Country affoorded.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we so quietly followed our businesse, that in three moneths wee made\r\nthree or foure Last of Tarre, Pitch, and Sope ashes; produced a tryall of\r\nGlasse; made a Well in the Fort of excellent sweet water, which till then\r\nwas wanting; built some twentie houses; recovered our Church; provided\r\nNets and Wires for fishing; and to stop the disorders of our disorderly\r\ntheeves, and the Salvages, built a Blockhouse in the neck of our Isle,\r\nkept by a Garrison to entertaine the Salvages trade, and none [III.86] to\r\npasse nor repasse Salvage nor Christian without the presidents order.\r\nThirtie or forty Acres of ground we digged and planted. Of three sowes in\r\neighteene moneths, increased 60, and od Piggs. And neere 500. chickings\r\nbrought up themselves without having any meat given them: but the Hogs\r\nwere transported to Hog Isle: where also we built a block-house with a\r\ngarison to give us notice of any shipping, and for their exercise they\r\nmade Clapbord and waynscot, and cut downe trees. We built also a fort for\r\na retreat neere a convenient River upon a high commanding hill, very hard\r\nto be assalted and easie to be defended, but ere it was finished this\r\ndefect caused a stay.\r\n\r\n                _Great extremitie by Rats._\r\n\r\n            _Bread made of dried Sturgeon._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n           _Their desire to destroy themselves._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nIn searching our casked corne, we found it halfe rotten, and the rest so\r\nconsumed with so many thousands of Rats that increased so fast, but there\r\noriginall was from the ships, as we knew not how to keepe that little we\r\nhad. This did drive us all to our wits end, for there was nothing in the\r\ncountry but what nature afforded. Untill this time Kemps and Tassore were\r\nfettered prisoners, and did double taske and taught us how to order and\r\nplant our fields: whom now for want of victuall we set at liberty, but so\r\nwell they liked our companies they did not desire to goe from us. And to\r\nexpresse their loves for 16. dayes continuance, the Countrie people\r\nbrought us (when least) 100. a day, of Squirrils, Turkyes, Deere and other\r\nwilde beasts: But this want of corne occasioned the end of all our works,\r\nit being worke sufficient to provide victuall. 60. or 80. with Ensigne\r\nLaxon was sent downe the river to live upon Oysters, and 20. with\r\nliutenant Percy to try for fishing at Poynt Comfort: but in six weekes\r\nthey would not agree once to cast out the net, he being sicke and burnt\r\nsore with Gunpouder. Master West with as many went up to the falls, but\r\nnothing could be found but a few Acornes; of that in store every man had\r\ntheir equall proportion. Till this present, by the hazard and indevours of\r\nsome thirtie or fortie, this whole Colony had ever beene fed. {MN-1} We\r\nhad more Sturgeon, then could be devoured by Dog and Man, of which the\r\nindustrious by drying and pounding, mingled with Caviare, Sorell and other\r\nwholesome hearbes would make bread and good meate: others would gather as\r\nmuch Tockwhogh roots, in a day as would make them bread a weeke, so that\r\nof those wilde fruites, and what we caught, we lived very well in regard\r\nof such a diet, {MN-2} But such was the strange condition of some 150,\r\nthat had they not beene forced nolens, volens, perforce to gather and\r\nprepare their victuall they would all have starved or have eaten one\r\nanother. Of those wild fruits the Salvages often brought us, and for that,\r\nthe President would not fullfill the unreasonable desire, of those\r\ndistracted Gluttonous Loyterers, to sell not only our kettles, hows,\r\ntooles, and Iron, nay swords, pieces, and the very Ordnance and howses,\r\nmight they have prevayled to have beene but Idle: for those Salvage\r\nfruites, they would have had imparted all to the Salvages, especially for\r\none basket of Corne they heard of to be at Powhatans, fifty myles from our\r\nFort. Though he bought neere halfe of it to satisfie their humors, yet to\r\nhave had the other halfe, they would have sould their soules, though not\r\nsufficient to have kept them a weeke. Thousands were their exclamations,\r\nsuggestions and devises, to force him to those base inventions to have\r\nmade it an occasion to abandon the Country. Want perforce constrained him\r\nto indure their exclaiming follies, till he found out the author, one Dyer\r\na most crafty fellow and his ancient Maligner, whom he worthily punished,\r\nand with the rest he argued the case in this maner.\r\n\r\n                 _The Presidents order for the drones._\r\n\r\nFellow souldiers, I did little thinke any so false to report, or so many\r\nto be so simple to be perswaded, that I either intend to starve you, or\r\nthat Powhatan at this present hath corne for himselfe, much lesse for you;\r\nor that I would not have it, if I knew where it were to be had. Neither\r\ndid I thinke any so malitious as now I see a great many; yet it shal not\r\nso passionate me, but I will doe my best for my most maligner. But dreame\r\nno longer of this vaine hope from Powhatan, not that I will longer\r\nforbeare to force you, from your Idlenesse, and punish you if you rayle.\r\nBut if I finde any more runners for Newfoundland with the Pinnace, let him\r\nassuredly looke to arive at the Gallows. You cannot deny but that by the\r\nhazard of my life many a time I have saved yours, when (might your owne\r\nwills have [III.87.] prevailed) you would have starved; and will doe still\r\nwhether I will or noe; But I protest by that God that made me, since\r\nnecessitie hath not power to force you to gather for your selves those\r\nfruites the earth doth yeeld, you shall not onely gather for your selves,\r\nbut those that are sicke. As yet I never had more from the store then the\r\nworst of you: and all my English extraordinary provision that I have, you\r\nshall see me divide it amongst the sick. And this Salvage trash you so\r\nscornfully repine at; being put in your mouthes your stomackes can\r\ndisgest, if you would have better you should have brought it; and\r\ntherefore I will take a course you shall provide what is to be had. The\r\nsick shall not starve, but equally share of all our labours; and he that\r\ngathereth not every day as much as I doe, the next day shall be set beyond\r\nthe river, and be banished from the Fort as a drone, till he amend his\r\nconditions or starve. But some would say with Seneca.\r\n\r\n    I know those things thou sayst are true good Nurse,\r\n    But fury forceth me to follow worse.\r\n    My minde is hurried headlong up and downe:\r\n    Desiring better counsell, yet finds none.\r\n\r\n                 _But seven of 200. dyed in nine months._\r\n\r\nThis order many murmured was very cruell, but it caused the most part so\r\nwell bestirre themselves, that of 200. (except they were drowned) there\r\ndied not past seven: as for Captaine Winne and Master Leigh they were dead\r\nere this want hapned, and the rest dyed not for want of such as preserved\r\nthe rest. Many were billetted amongst the Salvages, whereby we knew all\r\ntheir passages, fields and habitations, how to gather and use their fruits\r\nas well as themselves; for they did know wee had such a commanding power\r\nat James towne they durst not wrong us of a pin.\r\n\r\n                 _The Salvages return our fugitives._\r\n\r\nSo well those poore Salvages used us that were thus billetted, that divers\r\nof the Souldiers ran away to search Kemps & Tassore our old prisoners.\r\nGlad were these Salvages to have such an oportunity to testifie their love\r\nunto us, for in stead of entertaining them, and such things as they had\r\nstollen, with all their great Offers, and promises they made them how to\r\nrevenge their injuryes upon Captaine Smith; Kemps first made himselfe\r\nsport, in shewing his countrie men (by them) how he was used, feeding them\r\nwith this law, who would not work must not eat, till they were neere\r\nstarved indeede, continually threatning to beate them to death: neither\r\ncould they get from him, till hee and his consorts brought them perforce\r\nto our Captaine, that so well contented him and punished them, as many\r\nothers that intended also to follow them, were rather contented to labour\r\nat home, then adventure to live idlely amongst the Salvages; (of whom\r\nthere was more hope to make better Christians & good subjects, then the\r\none halfe of those that counterfeited themselves both.) For so affraide\r\nwas al those kings and the better sort of the people to displease us, that\r\nsome of the baser sort that we have extreamly hurt and punished for their\r\nvillanies would hire us, we should not tell it to their kings, or\r\ncountrymen, who would also repunish them, and yet returne them to James\r\ntowne to content the President for a testimony of their loves.\r\n\r\n          _Master Sicklemores Journey to Chawwonoke._\r\n\r\nMaster Sicklemore well returned from Chawwonoke; but found little hope and\r\nlesse certaintie of them were left by Sir Walter Raleigh. The river, he\r\nsaw was not great, the people few, the countrey most over growne with\r\npynes, where there did grow here and there straglingly Pemminaw, we call\r\nsilke grasse. But by the river the ground was good, and exceeding furtill.\r\n\r\n                _Master Powels jorney to the Mangoags._\r\n\r\nMaster Nathanael Powell and Anas Todkill were also by the\r\nQuiyoughquohanocks conducted to the Mangoags to search them there: but\r\nnothing could they learne but they were all dead. This honest proper good\r\npromise keeping king, of all the rest did ever best affect us, and though\r\nto his false Gods he was very zealous, yet he would confesse our God as\r\nmuch exceeded his as our Gunns did his Bow and Arrowes, often sending our\r\nPresident many presents, to pray to his God for raine or his corne would\r\nperish, for his Gods were angry. Three [III.88.] dayes journey they\r\nconducted them through the woods, into a high country towards the\r\nSouthwest: where they saw here and there a little corne field, by some\r\nlittle spring or smal brooke, but no river they could see: the people in\r\nall respects like the rest, except their language: they live most upon\r\nrootes, fruites and wilde beasts; and trade with them towards the sea and\r\nthe fatter countryes for dryed fish and corne, for skins.\r\n\r\n               _The Dutch mens projects._\r\n\r\n        _Two Gentlemen sent to the Germans._ {MN}\r\n\r\nAll this time to recover the Dutch-men and one Bentley another fugitive,\r\nwe imployed one William Volday, a Zwitzar by birth, with Pardons &\r\npromises to regaine them. Little we then suspected this double villaine of\r\nany villany; who plainly taught us, in the most trust was the greatest\r\ntreason; for this wicked hypocrite, by the seeming hate he bore to the\r\nlewd conditions of his cursed country men, (having this oportunity by his\r\nimployment to regaine them) convayed them every thing they desired to\r\neffect their projects, to distroy the Colony. With much devotion they\r\nexpected the Spaniard, to whom they intended good service, or any other,\r\nthat would but carry them from us. But to begin with the first oportunity;\r\nthey seeing necessitie thus inforced us to disperse our selves, importuned\r\nPowhatan to lend them but his forces, and they would not onely distroy our\r\nHoggs, fire our towne, and betray our Pinnace; but bring to his service\r\nand subjection the most of our company. With this plot they had acquainted\r\nmany Discontents, and many were agreed to their Devilish practise. But one\r\nThomas Douse, and Thomas Mallard (whose Christian hearts relented at such\r\nan unchristian act) voluntarily revealed it to Captaine Smith, who caused\r\nthem to conceale it, perswading Douse and Mallard to proceed in their\r\nconfedracie: onely to bring the irreclamable Dutch men and the inconstant\r\nSalvages in such a maner amongst such Ambuscade's as he had prepared, that\r\nnot many of them should returne from our Peninsula. But this brute comming\r\nto the eares of the impatient multitude they so importuned the President\r\nto cut off those Dutch men, as amongst many that offred to cut their\r\nthroats before the face of Powhatan, the first was Lieutenant Percy, and\r\nMr. John Cuderington, two Gentlemen of as bold resolute spirits as could\r\npossibly be found. {MN} But the President had occasion of other imploiment\r\nfor them, & gave way to Master Wyffin and Sarjeant Jeffrey Abbot, to goe\r\nand stab them or shoot them. But the Dutch men made such excuses, accusing\r\nVolday whom they supposed had revealed their project, as Abbot would not,\r\nyet Wyffin would, perceiving it but deceit. The King understanding of\r\nthis their imployment, sent presently his messengers to Captaine Smith to\r\nsignifie it was not his fault to detaine them, nor hinder his men from\r\nexecuting his command: nor did he nor would he maintaine them, or any to\r\noccasion his displeasure.\r\n\r\n               _The first arrivall of Captaine Argall._\r\n\r\nBut whilst this businesse was in hand. Arrived one Captaine Argall, and\r\nMaster Thomas Sedan, sent by Master Cornelius to truck with the Colony,\r\nand fish for Sturgeon, with a ship well furnished, with wine and much\r\nother good provision. Though it was not sent us, our necessities was such\r\nas inforced us to take it. He brought us newes of a great supply and\r\npreparation for the Lord La Warre, with letters that much taxed our\r\nPresident for his hard dealing with the Salvages, and not returning the\r\nshippes fraughted. Notwithstanding we kept this ship till the fleete\r\narrived. True it is Argall lost his voyage, but we revictualled him, and\r\nsent him for England, with a true relation of the causes of our\r\ndefailments, and how imposible it was to returne that wealth they expected,\r\nor observe their instructions to indure the Salvages insolencies, or doe\r\nany thing to any purpose, except they would send us men and meanes that\r\ncould produce that they so much desired: otherwises all they did was lost,\r\nand could not but come to confusion. The villany of Volday we still\r\ndissembled. Adam upon his pardon came home but Samuell still stayed with\r\nPowhatan to heare further of their estates by this supply. Now all their\r\nplots Smith so well understood, they were his best advantages to secure us\r\nfrom any trechery, could be done by them or the Salvages: which with\r\nfacility he could revenge when he would, because all those countryes more\r\nfeared him then Powhatan, and hee had such parties with all his bordering\r\nneighbours: and many of the rest for love or feare would have done any\r\nthing he would have them, upon any [III.89.] commotion, though these\r\nfugitives had done all they could to perswade Powhatan, King James would\r\nkill Smith, for using him and his people so unkindly.\r\n\r\n                  _Note these inconveniences._\r\n\r\nBy this you may see for all those crosses, trecheries, and dissentions,\r\nhow hee wrestled and overcame (without bloudshed) all that happened: also\r\nwhat good was done; how few dyed; what food the Countrey naturally\r\naffoordeth; what small cause there is men should starve, or be murthered\r\nby the Salvages, that have discretion to mannage them with courage and\r\nIndustrie. The two first yeares, though by his adventures, he had oft\r\nbrought the Salvages to a tractable trade, yet you see how the envious\r\nauthoritie ever crossed him, and frustrated his best endevours. But it\r\nwrought in him that experience and estimation amongst the Salvages, as\r\notherwise it had bin impossible, he had ever effected that he did.\r\nNotwithstanding the many miserable, yet generous and worthy adventures, he\r\nhad oft and long endured in the wide world, yet in this case he was againe\r\nto learne his Lecture by experience. Which with thus much adoe having\r\nobtained, it was his ill chance to end, when he had but onely learned how\r\nto begin. And though he left those unknowne difficulties (made easie and\r\nfamiliar) to his unlawfull successors, (who onely by living in James\r\nTowne, presumed to know more then all the world could direct them:) Now\r\nthough they had all his Souldiers, with a tripple power, and twice tripple\r\nbetter meanes; by what they have done in his absence, the world may see\r\nwhat they would have done in his presence, had he not prevented their\r\nindiscretions: it doth justly prove, what cause he had to send them for\r\nEngland, and that he was neither factious, mutinous, nor dishonest. But\r\nthey have made it more plaine since his returne for England; having his\r\nabsolute authoritie freely in their power, with all the advantages and\r\nopportunitie that his labours had effected. As I am sorry their actions\r\nhave made it so manifest, so I am unwilling to say what reason doth\r\ncompell me, but onely to make apparant the truth, least I should seeme\r\npartiall, reasonlesse, and malicious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               A.D. 1609\r\n\r\n                             Chapter XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    The Arrivall of the third Supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _The alteration of the government._\r\n\r\n                1609. _Sir Thomas Smith Treasurer._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                     _The losse of Virginia._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\n           _The Salvages offer to fight under our colours._ {MN-3}\r\n\r\nTo redresse those jarres and ill proceedings, the Treasurer, Councell, and\r\nCompany of Virginia, not finding that returne, and profit they expected;\r\nand them ingaged there, not having meanes to subsist of themselves, made\r\nmeanes to his Majestie, to call in their Commission, and take a new in\r\ntheir owne names, as in their owne publication, 1610. you may reade at\r\nlarge. Having thus annihilated the old by vertue of a Commission made to\r\nthe right Honourable, Sir Thomas West, Lord de la Warre, to be Generall of\r\nVirginia; Sir Thomas Gates, his Lieutenant; Sir George Somers, Admirall;\r\nSir Thomas Dale, high Marshall; Sir Fardinando Wainman, Generall of the\r\nHorse; and so all other offices to many other worthy Gentlemen, for their\r\nlives: (though not any of them had ever beene in Virginia; except Captaine\r\nNewport, who was also by Patent made vice-Admirall:) those noble Gentlemen\r\ndrew in such great summes of money, that they sent Sir Thomas Gates, Sir\r\nGeorge Somers, and Captaine Newport with nine shippes, and five hundred\r\npeople, who had each of them a Commission, who first arrived to call in\r\nthe old, without the knowledge or consent of them, that had endured all\r\nthose former dangers to beat the path, not any regard had at all of them.\r\nAll things being ready, because those three Captaines could not agree for\r\nplace, it was concluded they should goe all in one ship, so all their\r\nthree Commissions were in that Ship with them called the Sea-Venture.\r\n{MN-1} They set sayle from England in May 1609. A small Catch perished at\r\nSea in a Hericano: the Admirall with an hundred and fiftie men, with the\r\ntwo Knights, and their new Commission, their Bils of Loading, with all\r\nmanner of directions, and the most part of their provision arrived\r\n[III.90.] not. {MN-2} With the other seaven Ships as Captaines arrived\r\nRatliffe, whose right name (as is sayd) was Sicklemore, Martin, and\r\nArchur, with Captaine Wood, Captaine Webbe, Captaine Moone, Captaine King,\r\nCaptaine Davis, and divers Gentlemen of good meanes, and great parentage.\r\nBut the first as they had beene troublesome at Sea, began againe to marre\r\nall ashore: for though (as is said) they were formerly sent for England,\r\nyet now returning againe, graced by the titles of Captaines of the\r\npassengers, seeing the Admirall wanting, and great probabilitie of her\r\nlosse, strengthened themselves with those new companies, so exclaiming\r\nagainst Captaine Smith, that they mortally hated him ere ever they saw\r\nhim. Who understanding by his Scouts the arrivall of such a Fleet, little\r\ndreaming of any such supply, supposed them Spanyards. But he quickly so\r\ndetermined and ordered our affaires, as we little feared their Arrivall,\r\nnor the successe of our incounter; {MN-3} nor were the Salvages any way\r\nnegligent for the most part, to ayd and assist us with their best power.\r\nHad it so beene we had beene happy; for we would not have trusted them but\r\nas our foes, where receiving them as our Countreymen and friends, they did\r\nwhat they could to murther our President, to surprise the Store, the Fort,\r\nand our lodgings, to usurpe the government, and make us all their servants\r\nand slaves, till they could consume us and our remembrance; and rather\r\nindeed to supplant us then supply us, as master William Box an honest\r\nGentleman in this voyage thus relateth.\r\n\r\nIn the tayle of a Hericano wee were separated from the Admirall, which\r\nalthough it was but the remainder of that Storme, there is seldome any\r\nsuch in England, or those Northerne parts of Europe. Some lost their\r\nMasts, some their Sayles blowne from their Yards; the Seas so over-raking\r\nour Ships, much of our provision was spoyled, our Fleet separated, and our\r\nmen sicke, and many dyed, and in this miserable estate we arrived in\r\nVirginia. But in this Storme,\r\n\r\n    When ratling Thunder ran along the Clouds;\r\n    Did not the Saylers poore, and Masters proud\r\n    A terror feele as strucke with feare of God?\r\n    Did not their trembling joynts then dread his rod?\r\n    Least for foule deeds and black mouth'd blasphemies,\r\n    The rufull time be come that vengeance cryes.\r\n\r\n                      _Muntinies._\r\n\r\nTo a thousand mischiefes those lewd Captaines led this lewd company,\r\nwherein were many unruly Gallants, packed thither by their friends to\r\nescape ill destinies, and those would dispose and determine of the\r\ngovernment, sometimes to one, the next day to another; to day the old\r\nCommission must rule, to morrow the new, the next day neither, in fine\r\nthey would rule all, or ruine all: yet in charitie we must endure them\r\nthus to destroy us, or by correcting their follies, have brought the\r\nworlds censure upon us to be guiltie of their blouds. Happie had we beene\r\nhad they never arrived, and we for ever abandoned, and as we were left to\r\nour fortunes: for on earth for the number was never more confusion, or\r\nmisery, then their factions occasioned.\r\n\r\n                _The planting Nandsamund._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThe President seeing the desire those Braves had to rule; seeing how his\r\nauthoritie was so unexpectedly changed, would willingly have left all, and\r\nhave returned for England. But seeing there was small hope this new\r\nCommission would arrive, longer he would not suffer those factious spirits\r\nto proceede. It would be too tedious, too strange, and almost incredible;\r\nshould I particularly relate the infinite dangers, plots, and practices,\r\nhe daily escaped amongst this factious crew; the chiefe whereof he quickly\r\nlayd by the heeles, till his leasure better served to doe them justice:\r\nand to take away all occasions of further mischiefe, Master Percie had his\r\nrequest granted to returne for England, being very sicke; and Mr. West\r\nwith an hundred and twentie of the best he could chuse, he sent to the\r\nFalles; {MN} Martin with neare as many to Nandsamund, with their due\r\nproportions of all provisions according to their numbers.\r\n\r\n           _The breach of peace with the Salvages._ {MN}\r\n\r\n[III.91.] Now the Presidents yeare being neare expired, he made Captaine\r\nMartin President to follow the order for the election of a President every\r\nyeare: but he knowing his owne insufficiency, and the companies\r\nuntowardnesse and little regard of him, within three houres after resigned\r\nit againe to Captaine Smith, and at Nandsamund thus proceeded. {MN} The\r\npeople being contributes used him kindly; yet such was his jealous feare,\r\nin the midst of their mirth, he did surprise this poore naked King, with\r\nhis Monuments, houses, and the Isle he inhabited, and there fortified\r\nhimselfe; but so apparantly distracted with feare, as imboldened the\r\nSalvages to assault him, kill his men, release their King, gather and\r\ncarry away a thousand bushels of Corne, he not once offering to intercept\r\nthem; but sent to the President then at the Falles for thirtie good shot;\r\nwhich from James Towne immediately was sent him. But he so well imployed\r\nthem they did just nothing, but returned complaining of his tendernesse:\r\nyet he came away with them to James Towne, leaving his company to their\r\nfortunes.\r\n\r\nHere I cannot omit the courage of George Forrest, that had seaventeene\r\nArrowes sticking in him, and one shot through him, yet lived sixe or\r\nseaven dayes, as if he had small hurt, then for want of Chirurgery dyed.\r\n\r\nMaster West having seated his men by the Falles, presently returned to\r\nrevisit James Towne: the President followed him to see that company\r\nseated; met him by the way, wondering at his so quicke returne; and found\r\nhis company planted so inconsiderately, in a place not onely subject to\r\nthe rivers inundation, but round invironed with many intolerable\r\ninconveniences.\r\n\r\n                   _Powhatan bought for copper._\r\n\r\nFor remedie whereof he presently sent to Powhatan to sell him the place\r\ncalled Powhatan, promising to defend him against the Monacans. And these\r\nshould be his Conditions (with his people) to resigne him the Fort and\r\nhouses, and all that Countrey for a proportion of Copper; that all\r\nstealing offenders should be sent him, there to receive their punishment;\r\nthat every house as a Custome should pay him a Bushell of Corne for an\r\ninch square of Copper, and a proportion of Pocones, as a yearely tribute\r\nto King James for their protection, as a dutie; what else they could spare\r\nto barter at their best discretions.\r\n\r\n                             _Muntinies._\r\n\r\n                _Five suppresse an hundred and twentie._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n          _Breach of peace with the Salvages at the Falles._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nBut both this excellent place and those good Conditions did those furies\r\nrefuse, contemning both him, his kinde care and authoritie. So much they\r\ndepended on the Lord Generals new Commission; as they regarded none: the\r\nworst they could doe to shew their spights they did; supposing all the\r\nMonacans Country, gold; and none should come there but whom they pleased.\r\n{MN-1} I doe more then wonder to thinke how onely with five men, he either\r\ndurst or would adventure as he did, (knowing how greedie they were of his\r\nbloud) to land amongst them, and commit to imprisonment all the\r\nChieftaines of those mutinies, till by their multitudes being an hundred\r\nand twentie they forced him to retyre: yet in that interim he surprised\r\none of their Boates, wherewith he returned to their ship; where in deed\r\nwas their provision, which also he tooke, and well it chanced he found the\r\nMarriners so tractable and constant, or there had beene small possibilitie\r\nhe had ever escaped. There were divers other of better reason and\r\nexperience, that from their first landing, hearing the generall good\r\nreport of his old Souldiers, and seeing with their eyes his actions so\r\nwell mannaged with discretion, as Captaine Wood, Captaine Webbe, Cap.\r\nMoone, Captaine Fitzjames, Master William Powell, Master Partridge,\r\nMaster White, and divers others, when they perceived the malice of\r\nRatliffe and Archer, and their faction, left their companies, and ever\r\nrested his faithfull friends. {MN-2} But the worst was that the poore\r\nSalvages, that daily brought in their contribution to the President, that\r\ndisorderly Breach of company so tormented those poore soules, by stealing\r\ntheir corne, robbing their gardens, beating them, breaking their houses\r\nand keeping some prisoners; that they daily complained to Captaine Smith,\r\nhe had brought them for Protectors, worse enemies then the Monacans\r\nthemselves: which though till then, for his love they had endured, they\r\ndesired pardon if hereafter they defended themselves; since he would not\r\ncorrect them, as they had long expected he [III.92.] would. So much they\r\nimportuned him to punish their misdemeanors, as they offered (if he would\r\nleade them) to fight for him against them. But having spent nine dayes\r\nin seeking to reclaime them; shewing them how much they did abuse\r\nthemselves with these great guilded hopes of the South Sea Mines,\r\ncommodities, or victories, they so madly conceived; then seeing nothing\r\nwould prevaile, he set sayle for James Towne.\r\n\r\n   Thus oft we see from small greene wounds, and from a little griefe,\r\n   A greater sore and sicknesse growes, then will admit reliefe:\r\n   For thus themselves they did beguile, and with the rest play'd theefe.\r\n\r\n                     _An assalt by the Salvages._\r\n\r\n                   _The planting of Non-such._ {MN}\r\n\r\nNow no sooner was the Ship under sayle, but the Salvages assaulted those\r\nhundred and twentie in their Fort, finding some stragling abroad in the\r\nwoods: they slew many, and so affrighted the rest, as their prisoners\r\nescaped, and they safely retyred, with the swords and cloakes of those\r\nthey had slaine. But ere wee had sayled halfe a league, our ship\r\ngrounding, gave us once more libertie to summon them to a parley; where we\r\nfound them all so strangely amazed with this poore silly assault of twelve\r\nSalvages, that they submitted themselves upon any tearmes to the\r\nPresidents mercy; who presently put by the heeles sixe or seaven of the\r\nchiefe offenders: the rest he seated gallantly at Powhatan, in that\r\nSalvage Fort, readie built, and prettily fortified with poles and barkes\r\nof trees, sufficient to have defended them from all the Salvages in\r\nVirginia, dry houses for lodgings and neere two hundred accres of ground\r\nready to be planted, {MN} and no place we knew so strong, so pleasant and\r\ndelightfull in Virginia for which we called it Non-such. The Salvages also\r\nhee presently appeased, redelivering to either party their former losses.\r\nThus all were friends.\r\n\r\n                    _The Salvages appeased._\r\n\r\nNew officers appointed to command, and the President againe ready to\r\ndepart, at that instant arrived Captaine West, whose gentle nature, by the\r\nperswasions and compassion of those mutinous prisoners, (alledging they\r\nhad onely done this for his honor) was so much abused, that to regaine\r\ntheir old hopes, new turboyles did arise. For they a-shore being possessed\r\nof all their victuall, munition, and every thing, grew to that height in\r\ntheir former factions, as the President left them to their fortunes: they\r\nreturned againe to the open ayre at Wests Fort, abandoning Non-such, and\r\nhe to James towne with his best expedition, but this hapned him in that\r\nJourney.\r\n\r\n                 _Captaine Smith blowne up with powder._\r\n\r\n                       _A bloudy intent._ {MN}\r\n\r\nSleeping in his Boate, (for the ship was returned two daies before)\r\naccidentallie, one fired his powder-bag, which tore the flesh from his\r\nbody and thighes, nine or ten inches square in a most pittifull manner;\r\nbut to quench the tormenting fire, frying him in his cloaths he leaped\r\nover-boord into the deepe river, where ere they could recover him he was\r\nneere drowned. In this estate without either Chirurgian, or Chirurgery he\r\nwas to goe neere an hundred myles. Arriving at James towne, causing all\r\nthings to be prepared for peace or warres to obtaine provision, whilest\r\nthose things were providing, Ratliffe, Archer, & the rest of their\r\nConfederates, being to come to their trials; their guiltie consciences,\r\nfearing a just reward for their deserts, seeing the President, unable to\r\nstand, and neere bereft of his senses by reason of his torment, they had\r\nplotted to have murdered him in his bed. {MN} But his heart did faile him\r\nthat should have given fire to that mercilesse Pistoll. So not finding\r\nthat course to be the best, they joyned together to usurpe the government,\r\nthereby to escape their punishment. The President, had notice of their\r\nprojects, the which to withstand, though his old souldiers importuned him\r\nbut permit them to take their heads that would resist his command, yet he\r\nwould not suffer them, but sent for the Masters of the ships, and tooke\r\norder with them for his returne for England. Seeing there was neither\r\nChirurgian, nor Chirurgery in the Fort to cure his hurt, and the ships to\r\ndepart the next day, his Commission to be suppressed he knew not why,\r\nhimselfe and souldiers to [III.93.] be rewarded he knew not how, and a new\r\ncommission granted they knew not to whom (the which disabled that\r\nauthority he had, as made them presume so oft to those mutinies as they\r\ndid:) besides so grievous were his wounds, and so cruell his torments (few\r\nexpecting he could live) nor was hee able to follow his busines to regaine\r\nwhat they had lost, suppresse those factions, and range the countries for\r\nprovision as he intended; and well he knew in those affaires his owne\r\nactions and presence was as requisit as his directions, which now could\r\nnot be, he went presently abroad, resolving there to appoint them\r\ngovernours, and to take order for the mutiners, but he could finde none\r\nhee thought fit for it would accept it. In the meane time, seeing him\r\ngone, they perswaded Master Percy to stay, who was then to goe for\r\nEngland, and be their President. Within lesse then an houre was this\r\nmutation begun and concluded. For when the Company understood Smith would\r\nleave them, & saw the rest in Armes called Presidents & Councellors,\r\ndivers began to fawne on those new commanders, that now bent all their\r\nwits to get him resigne them his Commission: who after much adoe and many\r\nbitter repulses; that their confusion (which he tould them was at their\r\nelbowes) should not be attributed to him, for leaving the Colony without a\r\nCommission, he was not unwilling they should steale it, but never would he\r\ngive it to such as they.\r\n\r\n  And thus, Strange violent forces drew us on unwilling:\r\n            Reason perswading 'gainst our loves rebelling.\r\n            We saw and knew the better, ah curse accurst!\r\n            That notwithstanding: we imbrace the worst.\r\n\r\n       _The causes why Smith left the Countrey and his Commission._\r\n\r\nBut had that unhappie blast not hapned, he would quickly have qualified\r\nthe heate of those humors, and factions, had the ships but once left them\r\nand us to our fortunes; and have made that provision from among the\r\nSalvages, as we neither feared Spanyard, Salvage, nor famine; nor would\r\nhave left Virginia, nor our lawfull authoritie, but at as deare a price as\r\nwe had bought it, and payd for it. What shall I say but thus, we left him,\r\nthat in all his proceedings, made Justice his first guide, and experience\r\nhis second, even hating basenesse, sloath, pride, and indignitie, more\r\nthen any dangers; that never allowed more for himselfe, then his souldiers\r\nwith him; that upon no danger would send them where he would not lead them\r\nhimselfe; that would never see us want, what he either had, or could by\r\nany meanes get us; that would rather want then borrow, or starve then not\r\npay; that loved action more then words, and hated falshood and\r\ncovetousnesse worse then death; whose adventures were our lives, and whose\r\nlosse our deaths.\r\n\r\nLeaving us thus with three ships, seaven boats, commodities readie to\r\ntrade, the harvest newly gathered, ten weeks provision in the store, foure\r\nhundred nintie and od persons, twentie-foure Peeces of Ordnance, three\r\nhundred Muskets, Snaphances, and Firelockes, Shot, Powder, and Match\r\nsufficient, Curats, Pikes, Swords, and Morrios, more then men; the\r\nSalvages, their language, and habitations well knowne to an hundred well\r\ntrayned and expert Souldiers; Nets for fishing; Tooles of all sorts to\r\nworke; apparell to supply our wants; six Mares and a Horse; five or sixe\r\nhundred Swine; as many Hennes and Chickens; some Goats; some sheepe; what\r\nwas brought or bred there remained. But they regarding nothing but from\r\nhand to mouth, did consume that wee had, tooke care for nothing, but to\r\nperfect some colourable complaints against Captaine Smith. For effecting\r\nwhereof three weekes longer they stayed the Ships, till they could produce\r\nthem. That time and charge might much better have beene spent, but it\r\nsuted well with the rest of their discretions.\r\n\r\nBesides James towne that was strongly Pallizadoed, containing some fiftie\r\nor sixtie houses, he left five or sixe other severall Forts and\r\nPlantations: though they were not so sumptuous as our successors expected,\r\nthey were better then they provided any for us. All this time we [III.94]\r\nhad but one Carpenter in the Countrey, and three others that could doe\r\nlittle, but desired to be learners: two Black-smiths; two saylers, & those\r\nwe write labourers were for most part footmen, and such as they that were\r\nAdventurers brought to attend them, or such as they could perswade to goe\r\nwith them, that never did know what a dayes worke was, except the\r\nDutch-men and Poles, and some dozen other. For all the rest were poore\r\nGentlemen, Tradsmen, Serving-men, libertines, and such like, ten times\r\nmore fit to spoyle a Common-wealth, then either begin one, or but helpe to\r\nmaintain one. For when neither the feare of God, nor the law, nor shame,\r\nnor displeasure of their friends could rule them here, there is small hope\r\never to bring one in twentie of them ever to be good there.\r\nNotwithstanding, I confesse divers amongst them, had better mindes and\r\ngrew much more industrious then was expected: yet ten good workemen would\r\nhave done more substantiall worke in a day, then ten of them in a weeke.\r\nTherefore men may rather wonder how we could doe so much, then use us so\r\nbadly, because we did no more, but leave those examples to make others\r\nbeware, and the fruits of all, we know not for whom.\r\n\r\n               _The ends of the Dutch-men._\r\n\r\nBut to see the justice of God upon these Dutch-men; Valdo before spoke of,\r\nmade a shift to get for England, where perswading the Merchants what rich\r\nMines he had found, and great service he would doe them, was very well\r\nrewarded, and returned with the Lord La Warre: but being found a meere\r\nImpostor, he dyed most miserably. Adam and Francis his two consorts were\r\nfled againe to Powhatan, to whom they promised at the arrivall of my Lord,\r\nwhat wonders they would doe, would he suffer them but to goe to him. But\r\nthe King seeing they would be gone, replyed; You that would have betrayed\r\nCaptaine Smith to mee, will certainely betray me to this great Lord for\r\nyour peace: so caused his men to beat out their braines.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the greatest honour that ever belonged to the greatest\r\nMonarkes, was the inlarging their Dominions, and erecting Common-weales.\r\nYet howsoever any of them have attributed to themselves, the Conquerors of\r\nthe world: there is more of the world never heard of them, then ever any\r\nof them all had in subjection: for the Medes, Persians, and Assyrians,\r\nnever Conquered all Asia, nor the Grecians but part of Europe and Asia.\r\nThe Romans indeed had a great part of both, as well as Affrica: but as for\r\nall the Northerne parts of Europe and Asia, the interior Southern and\r\nWesterne parts of Affrica, all America & Terra incognita, they were all\r\nignorant: nor is our knowledge yet but superficiall. That their\r\nbeginnings, ending, and limitations were proportioned by the Almightie is\r\nmost evident: but to consider of what small meanes many of them have begun\r\nis wonderfull. For some write that even Rome her selfe, during the Raigne\r\nof Romulus, exceeded not the number of a thousand houses. And Carthage\r\ngrew so great a Potentate, that at first was but incirculed in the thongs\r\nof a Bulls skinne, as to fight with Rome for the Empire of the world. Yea\r\nVenice at this time the admiration of the earth, was at first but a\r\nMarish, inhabited by poor Fishermen. And likewise Ninivie, Thebes,\r\nBabylon, Delus, Troy. Athens, Mycena and Sparta, grew from small\r\nbeginnings to be most famous States, though now they retaine little more\r\nthen a naked name. Now this our yong Common-wealth in Virginia, as you\r\nhave read once consisted but of 38 persons, and in two yeares increased\r\nbut to 200. yet by this small meanes so highly was approved the Plantation\r\nin Virginia, as how many Lords, with worthy Knights, and brave Gentlemen\r\npretended to see it, and some did, and now after the expence of fifteene\r\nyeares more, and such massie summes of men and money, grow they\r\ndisanimated? If we truely consider our Proceedings with the Spanyards, and\r\nthe rest, we have no reason to despayre for with so small charge, they\r\nnever had either greater Discoveries, with such certaine tryals of more\r\nseverall Commodities, then in this short time hath beene returned from\r\nVirginia, and by much lesse meanes. New England was brought out of\r\nobscuritie, and affoorded fraught for neare 200 sayle of ships, where\r\nthere is now erected a brave Plantation. For the happines of Summer Isles,\r\nthey are no lesse then either, and yet those have had a far lesse, and a\r\nmore difficult beginning, then either Rome, Carthage, or Venice.\r\n\r\n          Written by Richard Pots, Clarke of the Councell,\r\n               William Tankard, and G.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               A.D. 1609\r\n\r\n                            PANEGYRICK VERSES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Now seeing there is thus much Paper here to [III.95.] spare, that you\r\n      should not be altogether cloyed with Prose; such Verses as my worthy\r\n      Friends bestowed upon New England, I here present you, because with\r\n      honestie I can neither reject, nor omit their courtesies.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the deserved Honour of the Author, Captaine John Smith, and\r\n     his Worke.\r\n\r\n    Damn'd Envie is a sp'rite, that ever haunts\r\n      Beasts, mis-nam'd Men; Cowards, or Ignorants.\r\n    But, onely such shee followes, whose deare worth\r\n    (Maugre her malice) sets their glory forth.\r\n      If this faire Overture, then, take not; It\r\n      Is Envie's spight (deare friend) in men of wit;\r\n    Or Feare, lest morsels, which our mouths possesse,\r\n    Might fall from thence; or else, tis Sottishnesse.\r\n      If either; (I hope neither) thee they raise;\r\n      Thy Letters [FN] are as Letters in thy praise;\r\n    Who, by their vice, improve (when they reproove.)\r\n    Thy vertue; so, in hate, procure thee Love.\r\n      Then, On firme Worth: this Monument I frame;\r\n      Scorning for any Smith to forge such fame.\r\n\r\n                              John Davies, Heref:\r\n\r\n                              * * * * *\r\n\r\n  [FN] Hinderers.\r\n\r\n\r\n         To his worthy Captaine the Author.\r\n\r\n    That which wee call the subject of all Storie,\r\n      Is Truth: which in this Worke of thine gives glorie\r\n    To all that thou hast done.

[IV.105.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            A.D. 1609\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      To make Plaine\r\n          the True Proceedings of the Historie for 1609. we\r\n              must follow the examinations of Doctor\r\n                 Simons, and two learned Orations\r\n                 published by the Companie; with\r\n                   the relation of the Right\r\n                     Honourable the Lord\r\n                        De la Ware.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    What happened in the first government after the alteration in the\r\n       time of Captaine George Piercie their Governour.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _The planting Point Comfort._\r\n\r\nThe day before Captaine Smith returned for England with the ships,\r\nCaptaine Davis arrived in a small Pinace, with some sixteene proper men\r\nmore: To these were added a company from James towne, under the command of\r\nCaptaine John Sickelmore alias Ratliffe, to inhabit Point Comfort.\r\nCaptaine Martin and Captaine West, having lost their boats and neere halfe\r\ntheir men among the Salvages, were returned to James towne; for the\r\nSalvages no sooner understood Smith was gone, but they all revolted, and\r\ndid spoile and murther all they incountered. Now wee were all constrained\r\nto live onely on that Smith had onely for his owne Companie, for the rest\r\nhad consumed their proportions, and now they had twentie Presidents with\r\nall their appurtenances: Master Piercie our new President, was so sicke\r\nhee could neither goe nor stand. But ere all was consumed, Captaine West\r\nand Captaine Sickelmore, each with a small ship and thirtie or fortie men\r\nwell appointed, sought abroad to trade. Sickelmore upon the confidence of\r\nPowhatan, with about thirtie others as carelesse as himselfe, were all\r\nslaine, onely Jeffrey Shortridge escaped, and Pokahontas the Kings\r\ndaughter saved a boy called Henry Spilman, that lived many yeeres after,\r\nby her meanes, amongst the Patawomekes. Powhatan still as he found meanes,\r\ncut off their Boats, denied them trade, so that Captaine West set saile\r\nfor England. Now we all found the losse of Captaine Smith, yea his\r\ngreatest maligners could now curse his losse: as for corne, provision and\r\ncontribution from the Salvages, we had nothing but mortall wounds, with\r\nclubs and arrowes; as for our Hogs, Hens, Goats, Sheepe, Horse, or what\r\nlived, our commanders, officers & Salvages daily consumed them, some small\r\nproportions sometimes we tasted, till all was devoured; then swords,\r\narmes, pieces, or any thing, wee traded with the Salvages, whose cruell\r\nfingers were so oft imbrewed in our blouds, that what by their crueltie,\r\nour Governours indiscretion, and the losse of our ships, of five hundred\r\nwithin six moneths after Captaine Smiths departure, there remained not\r\npast sixtie men, women and children, most miserable and poore creatures;\r\nand those were preserved for the most part, by roots, herbes, acornes,\r\nwalnuts, berries, now and then a little fish: they that had startch in\r\nthese extremities, made no small use of it; yea, even the very skinnes of\r\nour horses. Nay, so great was our famine, that a Salvage we slew, and\r\nburied, the poorer sort tooke [IV.106.] him up againe and eat him, and so\r\ndid divers one another boyled and stewed with roots and herbs: And one\r\namongst the rest did kill his wife, powdered her, and had eaten part of\r\nher before it was knowne, for which hee was executed, as hee well\r\ndeserved; now whether shee was better roasted, boyled or carbonado'd, I\r\nknow not, but of such a dish as powdered wife I never heard of. This was\r\nthat time, which still to this day we called the starving time; it were\r\ntoo vile to say, and scarce to be beleeved, what we endured: but the\r\noccasion was our owne, for want of providence, industrie and government,\r\nand not the barrennesse and defect of the Countrie, as is generally\r\nsupposed; for till then in three yeeres, for the numbers were landed us,\r\nwe had never from England provision sufficient for six moneths, though it\r\nseemed by the bils of loading sufficient was sent us, such a glutton is\r\nthe Sea, and such good fellowes the Mariners; we as little tasted of the\r\ngreat proportion sent us, as they of our want and miseries, yet\r\nnotwithstanding they ever over-swayed and ruled the businesse, though we\r\nendured all that is said, and chiefly lived on what this good Countrie\r\nnaturally afforded; yet had wee beene even in Paradice it selfe with these\r\nGovernours, it would not have beene much better with us; yet there was\r\namongst us, who had they had the government as Captaine Smith appointed,\r\nbut that they could not maintaine it, would surely have kept us from those\r\nextremities of miseries. This in ten daies more, would have supplanted us\r\nall with death.\r\n\r\n                 _The arrivall of Sir Thomas Gates._\r\n\r\nBut God that would not this Countrie should be unplanted, sent Sir Thomas\r\nGates, and Sir George Sommers with one hundred and fiftie people most\r\nhappily preserved by the Bermudas to preserve us: strange it is to say how\r\nmiraculously they were preserved in a leaking ship, as at large you may\r\nreade in the insuing Historie of those Ilands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                A.D. 1610\r\n\r\n          The government resigned to Sir Thomas Gates, 1610.\r\n\r\n                       _James towne abandoned._ {MN}\r\n\r\nWhen these two Noble Knights did see our miseries, being but strangers in\r\nthat Countrie, and could understand no more of the cause, but by\r\nconjecture of our clamours and complaints, of accusing and excusing one\r\nanother: {MN} They embarked us with themselves, with the best meanes they\r\ncould, and abandoning James towne, set saile for England, whereby you may\r\nsee the event of the government of the former Commanders left to\r\nthemselves; although they had lived there many yeeres as formerly hath\r\nbeene spoken (who hindred now their proceedings, Captaine Smith being\r\ngone.)\r\n\r\nAt noone they fell to the Ile of Hogs, and the next morning to Mulbery\r\npoint, at what time they descried the Long-boat of the Lord la Ware, for\r\nGod would not have it so abandoned. For this honourable Lord, then\r\nGovernour of the Countrie, met them with three ships exceedingly well\r\nfurnished with all necessaries fitting, who againe returned them to the\r\nabandoned James towne. Out of the observations of William Simmons Doctor\r\nof Divinitie.\r\n\r\n\r\n               The government devolved to the Lord la Ware.\r\n\r\n                  _The arivall of the Lord la Ware._\r\n\r\nHis Lordship arrived the ninth of June 1610. accompanied with Sir\r\nFerdinando Waynman, Captaine Houlcroft, Captaine Lawson, and divers other\r\nGentlemen of sort; the tenth he came up with his fleet, went on shore,\r\nheard a Sermon, read his Commission, and entred into consultation for the\r\ngood of the Colonie, in which secret counsell we will a little leave them,\r\nthat we may duly observe the revealed counsell of God. Hee that shall but\r\nturne up his eie, and behold the spangled canopie of heaven, or shall but\r\ncast downe his eie, and consider the embroydered carpet of the earth, and\r\nwithall shall marke how the heavens heare the earth, and the earth the\r\nCorne and Oile, and they relieve the necessities of man, [IV.107.] that\r\nman will acknowledge Gods infinite providence: But hee that shall further\r\nobserve, how God inclineth all casuall events to worke the necessary helpe\r\nof his Saints, must needs adore the Lords infinite goodnesse; never had\r\nany people more just cause, to cast themselves at the very foot-stoole of\r\nGod, and to reverence his mercie, than this distressed Colonie; for if God\r\nhad not sent Sir Thomas Gates from the Bermudas, within foure daies they\r\nhad almost beene famished; if God had not directed the heart of that noble\r\nKnight to save the Fort from fiering at their shipping, for many were very\r\nimportunate to have burnt it, they had beene destitute of a present\r\nharbour and succour; if they had abandoned the Fort any longer time, and\r\nhad not so soone returned, questionlesse the Indians would have destroied\r\nthe Fort, which had beene the meanes of our safeties amongst them and a\r\nterror. If they had set saile sooner, and had lanched into the vast Ocean,\r\nwho would have promised they should have incountered the Fleet of the Lord\r\nla Ware, especially when they made for New found land, as they intended,\r\na course contrarie to our Navie approaching. If the Lord la Ware had not\r\nbrought with him a yeeres provision, what comfort would those poore soules\r\nhave received, to have beene relanded to a second distruction? This was\r\nthe arme of the Lord of Hosts, who would have his people passe the red Sea\r\nand Wildernesse, and then to possesse the land of Canaan: It was divinely\r\nspoken of Heathen Socrates, If God for man be carefull, why should man bee\r\nover-distrustfull? for he hath so tempered the contrary qualities of the\r\nElements,\r\n\r\n    That neither cold things want heat, nor moist things dry,\r\n    Nor sad things spirits, to quicken them thereby,\r\n    Yet make they musicall content of contrarietie,\r\n    Which conquer'd, knits them in such links together,\r\n    They doe produce even all this whatsoever.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lord Governour, after mature deliberation delivered some few words to\r\nthe Companie, laying just blame upon them, for their haughtie vanities and\r\nsluggish idlenesse, earnestly intreating them to amend those desperate\r\nfollies, lest hee should be compelled to draw the sword of Justice, and to\r\ncut off such delinquents, which he had rather draw, to the shedding of his\r\nvitall bloud, to protect them from injuries; heartning them with relation\r\nof that store hee had brought with him, constituting officers of all\r\nconditions, to rule over them, allotting every man his particular place,\r\nto watch vigilantly, and worke painfully: This Oration and direction being\r\nreceived with a generall applause, you might shortly behold the idle and\r\nrestie diseases of a divided multitude, by the unitie and authoritie of\r\nthis government to be substantially cured. Those that knew not the way to\r\ngoodnesse before, but cherished singularitie and faction, can now chalke\r\nout the path of all respective dutie and service: every man endevoureth to\r\noutstrip other in diligence: the French preparing to plant the Vines, the\r\nEnglish labouring in the Woods and grounds; every man knoweth his charge,\r\nand dischargeth the same with alacritie. Neither let any man be\r\ndiscouraged, by the relation of their daily labour (as though the sap of\r\ntheir bodies should bee spent for other mens profit) the setled times of\r\nworking, to effect all themselves, or as the Adventurers need desire,\r\nrequired no more paines than from six of the clocke in the morning, untill\r\nten, and from two in the afternoone, till foure, at both which times they\r\nare provided of spirituall and corporall reliefe. First, they enter into\r\nthe Church, and make their praiers unto God, next they returne to their\r\nhouses and receive their proportion of food. Nor should it bee conceived\r\nthat this businesse excludeth Gentlemen, whose breeding never knew what a\r\ndaies labour meant, for though they cannot digge, use the Spade, nor\r\npractice the Axe, yet may the staied spirits of any condition, finde how\r\nto imploy the force of knowledge, the exercise of counsell, the operation\r\nand power of their best breeding and qualities. The houses which are\r\nbuilt, are as warme [IV.108.] and defensive against wind and weather, as\r\nif they were tiled and slated, being covered above with strong boards,\r\nand some matted round with Indian mats. Our forces are now such as are\r\nable to tame the furie and trecherie of the Salvages: Our Forts assure the\r\nInhabitants, and frustrate all assaylants. And to leave no discouragement\r\nin the heart of any, who personally shall enter into this great action, I\r\nwill communicate a double comfort; first, Sir George Sommers, that worthy\r\nAdmirall hath undertaken a dangerous adventure for the good of the\r\nColonie.\r\n\r\n               _Sir George Sommers returne to the Bermudas._\r\n\r\nUpon the 15. of June, accompanied with Captaine Samuel Argall, hee\r\nreturned in two Pinaces unto the Bermudas, promising (if by any meanes God\r\nwill open a way to that Iland of Rocks) that he would soone returne with\r\nsix moneths provision of flesh; with much crosse weather at last hee there\r\nsafely arrived, but Captaine Argall was forced backe againe to James\r\ntowne, whom the Lord De la Ware not long after sent to the River of\r\nPatawomeke, to trade for Corne; where finding an English boy, one Henry\r\nSpilman, a young Gentleman well descended, by those people preserved from\r\nthe furie of Powhatan, by his acquaintance had such good usage of those\r\nkinde Salvages, that they fraughted his ship with Corne, wherewith he\r\nreturned to James towne.\r\n\r\n             _The building Fort Henry and Fort Charles._\r\n\r\nThe other comfort is, that the Lord la Ware hath built two new Forts, the\r\none called Fort Henry, the other Fort Charles, in honour of our most noble\r\nPrince, and his hopefull brother, upon a pleasant plaine, and neare a\r\nlittle Rivilet they call Southampton River; they stand in a wholsome aire,\r\nhaving plentie of Springs of sweet water, they command a great circuit of\r\nground, containing Wood, Pasture and Marsh, with apt places for Vines,\r\nCorne and Gardens; in which Forts it is resolved, that all those that come\r\nout of England, shall be at their first landing quartered, that the\r\nwearisomnesse of the Sea, may bee refreshed in this pleasing part of the\r\nCountrie, and Sir Thomas Gates hee sent for England. But to correct some\r\ninjuries of the Paspahegs, he sent Captaine Pearcie, Master Stacy, and\r\nfiftie or threescore shot, where the Salvages flying, they burnt their\r\nhouses, tooke the Queene and her children prisoners, whom not long after\r\nthey slew.\r\n\r\nThe fertilitie of the soile, the temperature of the climate, the forme of\r\ngovernment, the condition of our people, their daily invocating of the\r\nName of God being thus expressed; why should the successe, by the rules of\r\nmortall judgement, bee disparaged? why should not the rich harvest of our\r\nhopes be seasonably expected? I dare say, that the resolution of Caesar in\r\nFrance, the designes of Alexander, the discoveries of Hernando Cortes in\r\nthe West, and of Emanuel King of Portugal in the East, were not encouraged\r\nupon so firme grounds of state and possibilitie.\r\n\r\nBut his Lordship being at the fales, the Salvages assaulted his troopes\r\nand slew three or foure of his men. Not long after, his Honour growing\r\nvery sicke, he returned for England the 28. of March; in the ship were\r\nabout five and fiftie men, but ere we arrived at Fyall, fortie of us were\r\nneare sicke to death, of the Scurvie, Callenture, and other diseases: the\r\nGovernour being an English-man, kindly used us, but small reliefe we could\r\nget, but Oranges, of which we had plenty, whereby within eight daies wee\r\nrecovered, and all were well and strong by that they came into England.\r\nWritten by William Box.\r\n\r\nThe Counsell of Virginia finding the smalnesse of that returne which they\r\nhoped should have defrayed the charge of a new supply, entred into a deep\r\nconsultation, whether it were fit to enter into a new Contribution, or in\r\ntime to send for them home, and give over the action, and therefore they\r\nadjured Sir Thomas Gates to deale plainly with them, who with a solemne\r\nand a sacred oath replyed, That all things before reported were true, and\r\nthat all men know that wee stand at the devotion of politicke Princes and\r\nStates, who for their proper utilitie, devise all courses to grind our\r\nMerchants, and by all pretences to confiscate their goods, and to draw\r\nfrom us all manner of gaine by their inquisitive inventions, when in\r\nVirginia, a few yeeres labour by planting and husbandry, will furnish\r\n[IV.109.] all our defects with honour and securitie.

What other defects they had, I found by Sir Thomas Gates at the\r\nCowes; his Fleet was sufficiently furnished with supplies, but when it\r\nshall please God that Sir Thomas Dale, and Sir Thomas Gates shall arrive\r\nin Virginia {MN} with the extraordinarie supply of 100. Kine, and 200.\r\nSwine, besides store of other provision, for the maintenance of the\r\nColonie, there will appeare that successe in the action, as shall give no\r\nman cause of distrust, that hath already adventured, but incourage every\r\ngood minde to further so good a worke, as will redound both to the glory\r\nof God, to the credit of our nation, and the comfort of all those that\r\nhave beene instruments in the furthering of it.

This\r\nJeffrey Abbots, how ever this Author censures him, and the Governour\r\nexecutes him, I know he had long served both in Ireland and Netherlands,\r\nhere hee was a Sargeant of my Companie, and I never saw in Virginia a more\r\nsufficient Souldier, less turbulent, a better wit, more hardy or\r\nindustrious, nor any more forward to cut off them that sought to abandon\r\nthe Countrie, or wrong the Colonie; how ingratefully those deserts might\r\nbee rewarded, envied or neglected, or his farre inferiors preferred to\r\nover-top him, I know not, but such occasions might move a Saint, much more\r\na man, to an unadvised passionate impatience, but how ever, it seemes he\r\nhath beene punished for his offences, that was never rewarded for his\r\ndeserts. {MN} And even this Summer Cole and Kitchins plot with three more,\r\nbending their course to Ocanahowan, five daies journey from us, where they\r\nreport are Spaniards inhabiting. These were cut off by the Salvages, hired\r\nby us to hunt them home to receive their deserts: So as Sir Thomas Dale\r\nhath not beene so tyrannous nor severe by the halfe, as there was\r\noccasion, and just cause for it, and though the manner was not usuall, wee\r\nwere rather to have regard to those, whom we would have terrified and made\r\nfearefull to commit the like offences, than to the offenders justly\r\ncondemned, for amongst them so hardned in evill, the feare of a cruell,\r\npainfull and unusuall death more restraines them, than death it selfe.\r\nThus much I have proceeded of his endeavour, untill the comming of Sir\r\nThomas Gates, in preparing himselfe to proceed as he intended.\r\n\r\n[IV.111.] Now in England againe to second this noble Knight, the Counsell\r\nand Companie with all possible expedition prepared for Sir Thomas Gates\r\nsix tall ships, with three hundred men, and one hundred Kine and other\r\nCattell, with munition and all other manner of provision that could be\r\nthought needfull; and about the first or second of August, 1611. arrived\r\nsafely at James towne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             The government returned againe to Sir Thomas\r\n                           Gates, 1611.\r\n\r\n\r\n             _The second arrivall of Sir Thomas Gates._\r\n\r\nThese worthy Knights being met, after their welcoming salutations, Sir\r\nThomas Dale acquainted him what he had done, and what he intended, which\r\ndesigne Sir Thomas Gates well approving, furnished him with three hundred\r\nand fiftie men, such as himselfe made choice of. In the beginning of\r\nSeptember, 1611. hee set saile, and arrived where hee intended to build\r\nhis new towne: within ten or twelve daies he had invironed it with a pale,\r\nand in honour of our noble Prince Henry, called it Henrico. The next worke\r\nhe did, was building at each corner of the Towne, a high commanding\r\nWatch-house, a Church, and Store-houses; which finished, hee began to\r\nthinke upon convenient houses for himselfe and men, which with all\r\npossible speed hee could he effected, to the great content of his\r\ncompanie, and all the Colonie.\r\n\r\n                     _The building of Henrico._\r\n\r\nThis towne is situated upon a necke of a plaine rising land, three parts\r\ninvironed with the maine River, the necke of land well impaled, makes it\r\nlike an Ile; it hath three streets of well-framed houses, a handsome\r\nChurch, and the foundation of a better laid, to bee built of Bricke,\r\nbesides Store-houses, Watch-houses, and such like: Upon the verge of the\r\nRiver there are five houses, wherein live the honester sort of people, as\r\nFarmers in England, and they keepe continuall centinell for the townes\r\nsecuritie. About two miles from the towne, into the Maine, is another\r\npale, neere two miles in length, from River to River, guarded with\r\nseverall Commanders, with a good quantitie of Corne-ground impailed,\r\nsufficiently secured to maintaine more than I suppose will come this three\r\nyeeres.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the River, for the securitie of the towne, is\r\nintended to be impaled for the securitie of our Hogs, about two miles and\r\na halfe, by the name of Hope in Faith, and Coxendale, secured by five of\r\nour manner of Forts, which are but Palisadoes, called Charitie Fort, Mount\r\nMalado, a guest house for sicke people, a high seat and wholsome aire\r\nElisabeth Fort, and Fort Patience: And here hath Master Whitaker chosen\r\nhis Parsonage, impaled a faire framed Parsonage, and one hundred acres\r\ncalled Rocke hall, but these are not halfe finished.\r\n\r\n               _The building the Bermudas._ {MN}\r\n\r\nAbout Christmas following, in this same yeere 1611. in regard of the\r\ninjurie done us by them of Apamatuck, Sir Thomas Dale, without the losse\r\nof any, except some few Salvages, tooke it and their Corne, being but five\r\nmiles by land from Henrico, and considering how commodious it might be for\r\nus, resolved to possesse and plant it, {MN} and at the instant called it\r\nthe new Bermudas, whereunto hee hath laid out and annexed to the belonging\r\nfreedome and corporation for ever, many miles of Champian and Woodland\r\nground in severall hundreds, as the upper and nether hundreds, Rochdale\r\nhundred, West Sherly hundred, and Digs his hundred. In the nether hundred\r\nhe first began to plant, for there is the most Corne-ground, and with a\r\npale of two miles, cut over from River to River, whereby we have secured\r\neight English miles in compasse; upon which circuit, within halfe a mile\r\nof each other, are many faire houses already built, besides particular\r\nmens houses neere to the number of fiftie. Rochdale, by a crosse pale\r\nwelnigh foure miles long, is also planted with houses along the pale, in\r\nwhich hundred our Hogs and Cattell have twentie miles circuit to graze in\r\nsecurely. The building of the Citie is referred till our harvest be in,\r\nwhich he intends to make a retreat against any forraigne enemie.\r\n\r\nAbout fiftie miles from these is James towne, upon [IV.112.] a fertill\r\npeninsula, which although fomerly scandaled for an unhealthfull aire, wee\r\nfinde it as healthfull as any other part of the Countrie; it hath two\r\nrowes of houses of framed timber, and some of them two stories, and a\r\ngarret higher, three large Store-houses joined together in length, and hee\r\nhath newly strongly impaled the towne. This Ile, and much ground about it,\r\nis much inhabited: To Kecoughtan we accounted it fortie miles, where they\r\nlive well with halfe that allowance the rest have from the store, because\r\nof the extraordinarie quantitie of Fish, Fowle and Deere; as you may reade\r\nat large in the Discoveries of Captaine Smith. And thus I have truly\r\nrelated unto you the present estate of that small part of  Virginia wee\r\nfrequent and possesse.\r\n\r\n                             A.D. 1612\r\n\r\n                  _Sir Thomas Smith Treasurer._\r\n\r\n               _Captaine Argalls arrivall._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n            _How Pocahontas was taken prisoner._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nSince there was a ship fraughted with provision, and fortie men; and\r\nanother since then with the like number and provision, to stay twelve\r\nmoneths in the Countrie, with Captaine Argall, which was sent not long\r\nafter. {MN-1} After hee had recreated and refreshed his Companie, hee\r\nwas sent to the River Patawomeake, to trade for Corne, the Salvages about\r\nus having small quarter, but friends and foes as they found advantage and\r\nopportunitie: But to conclude our peace, thus it happened. Captaine\r\nArgall, having entred into a great acquaintance with Japazaws, an old\r\nfriend of Captaine Smiths, and so to all our Nation, ever since hee\r\ndiscovered the Countrie: hard by him there was Pocahontas, whom Captaine\r\nSmiths Relations intituleth the Numparell of Virginia, and though she had\r\nbeene many times a preserver of him and the whole Colonie, yet till this\r\naccident shee was never seene at James towne since his departure, being\r\nat Patawomeke, as it seemes, {MN-2} thinking her selfe unknowne, was\r\neasily by her friend Japazaws perswaded to goe abroad with him and his\r\nwife to see the ship, for Captaine Argall had promised him a Copper Kettle\r\nto bring her but to him, promising no way to hurt her, but keepe her till\r\nthey could conclude a peace with her father; the Salvage for this Copper\r\nKettle would have done any thing, it seemed by the Relation; for though\r\nshe had seene and beene in many ships, yet hee caused his wife to faine\r\nhow desirous she was to see one, and that hee offered to beat her for her\r\nimportunitie, till she wept. But at last he told her, if Pocahontas would\r\ngoe with her, hee was content: and thus they betraied the poore innocent\r\nPocahontas aboord, where they were all kindly feasted in the Cabbin.\r\nJapazaws treading oft on the Captaines foot, to remember he had done his\r\npart, the Captaine when he saw his time, perswaded Pocahontas to the\r\nGun-roome, faining to have some conference with Japazaws, which was onely\r\nthat she should not perceive hee was any way guiltie of her captivitie: so\r\nsending for her againe, hee told her before her friends, she must goe with\r\nhim, and compound peace betwixt her Countrie and us, before she ever\r\nshould see Powhatan, whereat the old Jew and his wife began to howle and\r\ncrie as fast as Pocahontas, that upon the Captaines faire perswasions,\r\nby degrees pacifying her selfe, and Japazaws and his wife, with the Kettle\r\nand other toies, went merrily on shore, and shee to James towne. A\r\nmessenger forthwith was sent to her father, that his daughter Pocahontas\r\nhe loved so dearely, he must ransome with our men, swords, peeces, tooles,\r\n&c. hee trecherously had stolne.\r\n\r\n      _Seven English returned from Powhatan prisoners._  {MN}\r\n\r\nThis unwelcome newes much troubled Powhatan, because hee loved both his\r\ndaughter and our commodities well, yet it was three moneths after ere hee\r\nreturned us any answer: {MN} then by the perswasion of the Councell, he\r\nreturned seven of our men, with each of them an unserviceable Musket, and\r\nsent us word, that Powhatan when wee would deliver his daughter, hee would\r\nmake us satisfaction for all injuries done us, and give us five hundred\r\nbushels of Corne, and for ever be friends with us. That he sent, we\r\nreceived in part of payment, and returned him this answer: That his\r\ndaughter should be well used, but we could not beleeve the rest of our\r\narmes were either lost or stolne from him, and therefore till hee sent\r\nthem, we would keepe his daughter.\r\n\r\n             _Sir Thomas Dale his voyage to Paumaunke._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThis answer, it seemed, much displeased him, for we [IV.113.] heard no\r\nmore from him a long time after, when with Captaine Argals ship, and some\r\nother vessels belonging to the Colonie,{MN} Sir Thomas Dale, with a\r\nhundred and fiftie men well appointed, went up into his owne River, to his\r\nchiefe habitation, with his daughter; with many scornfull bravado's they\r\naffronted us, proudly demanding why wee came thither; our reply was, Wee\r\nhad brought his daughter, and to receive the ransome for her that was\r\npromised, or to have it perforce. They nothing dismayed thereat, told us,\r\nWe were welcome if wee came to fight, for they were provided for us, but\r\nadvised us, if wee loved our lives to retire; else they would use us as\r\nthey had done Captaine Ratcliffe: We told them, wee would presently have a\r\nbetter answer; but we were no sooner within shot of the shore than they\r\nlet flie their Arrowes among us in the ship.\r\n\r\n                _A man shot in the forehead._\r\n\r\nBeing thus justly provoked, wee presently manned our Boats, went on shore,\r\nburned all their houses, and spoiled all they had we could finde; and so\r\nthe next day proceeded higher up the River, where they demanded why wee\r\nburnt their houses, and wee, why they shot at us: They replyed, it was\r\nsome stragling Salvage, with many other excuses, they intended no hurt,\r\nbut were our friends: We told them, wee came not to hurt them, but visit\r\nthem as friends also. Upon this we concluded a peace, and forthwith they\r\ndispatched messengers to Powhatan, whose answer, they told us, wee must\r\nexpect foure and twentie houres ere the messengers could returne: Then\r\nthey told us, our men were runne away for feare we would hang them, yet\r\nPowhatans men were runne after them; as for our Swords and Peeces, they\r\nshould be brought us the next day, which was only but to delay time; for\r\nthe next day they came not. Then we went higher, to a house of Powhatans,\r\ncalled Matchot, where we saw about foure hundred men well appointed; here\r\nthey dared us to come on shore, which wee did; no shew of feare they made\r\nat all, nor offered to resist our landing, but walking boldly up and downe\r\namongst us, demanded to conferre with our Captaine, of his comming in that\r\nmanner, and to have truce till they could but once more send to their King\r\nto know his pleasure, which if it were not agreeable to their expectation,\r\nthen they would fight with us, and defend their owne as they could, which\r\nwas but onely to deferre the time, to carrie away their provision; yet wee\r\npromised them truce till the next day at noone, and then if they would\r\nfight with us, they should know when we would begin by our Drums and\r\nTrumpets.\r\n\r\n         _Two of Powhatans sonnes come to see Pocahontas._\r\n\r\nUpon this promise, two of Powhatans sonnes came unto us to see their\r\nsister, at whose sight, seeing her well, though they heard to the\r\ncontrarie, they much rejoiced, promising they would perswade her father to\r\nredeeme her, and for ever be friends with us. And upon this, the two\r\nbrethren went aboord with us, and we sent Master John Rolfe and Master\r\nSparkes to Powhatan, to acquaint him with the businesse; kindly they were\r\nentertained, but not admitted the presence of Powhatan, but they spoke\r\nwith Opechancanough, his brother and successor; hee promised to doe the\r\nbest he could to Powhatan, all might be well. So it being Aprill, and time\r\nto prepare our ground and set our Corne, we returned to James Towne,\r\npromising the forbearance of their performing their promise, till the next\r\nharvest.\r\n\r\n                         A.D. 1613.\r\n\r\n                 _Sir Thomas Smith Treasurer._\r\n\r\n       _The marriage of Pocahontas to Master John Rolfe._\r\n\r\nLong before this, Master John Rolfe, an honest Gentleman, and of good\r\nbehaviour, had beene in love with Pocahontas, and she with him, which\r\nthing at that instant I made knowne to Sir Thomas Dale by a letter from\r\nhim, wherein hee intreated his advice, and she acquainted her brother with\r\nit, which resolution Sir Thomas Dale well approved: the brute of this\r\nmariage came soone to the knowledge of Powhatan, a thing acceptable to\r\nhim, as appeared by his sudden consent, for within ten daies he sent\r\nOpachisco, an old Uncle of hers, and two of his sons, to see the manner of\r\nthe marriage, and to doe in that behalfe what they were requested, for the\r\nconfirmation thereof, as his deputie; which was accordingly done about the\r\nfirst of Aprill: And ever since wee have had friendly trade and commerce,\r\nas well with Powhatan himselfe, as all his subjects.\r\n\r\n                _The Chicahamanias desire friendship._\r\n\r\nBesides this, by the meanes of Powhatan, we became [IV.114.] in league\r\nwith our next neighbours, the Chicahamanias, a lustie and a daring people,\r\nfree of themselves. These people, so soone as they heard of our peace with\r\nPowhatan, sent two messengers with presents to Sir Thomas Dale, and\r\noffered him their service, excusing all former injuries, hereafter they\r\nwould ever be King James his subjects, and relinquish the name of\r\nChickahamania, to be called Tassautessus, as they call us, and Sir Thomas\r\nDale there Governour, as the Kings Deputie; onely they desired to be\r\ngoverned by their owne Lawes, which is eight of their Elders as his\r\nsubstitutes. This offer he kindly accepted, and appointed the day hee\r\nwould come to visit them.\r\n\r\nWhen the appointed day came, Sir Thomas Dale and Captaine Argall with\r\nfiftie men well appointed, went to Chickahamania, where wee found the\r\npeople expecting our comming, they used us kindly, and the next morning\r\nsate in counsell, to conclude their peace upon these conditions:\r\n\r\n                        _Articles of Peace._\r\n\r\nFirst, they should for ever bee called Englishmen, and bee true subjects\r\nto King James and his Deputies.\r\n\r\nSecondly, neither to kill nor detaine any of our men, nor cattell, but\r\nbring them home.\r\n\r\nThirdly, to bee alwaies ready to furnish us with three hundred men,\r\nagainst the Spaniards or any.\r\n\r\nFourthly, they shall not enter our townes, but send word they are new\r\nEnglishmen.\r\n\r\nFiftly, that every fighting man, at the beginning of harvest, shall bring\r\nto our store two bushels of Corne, for tribute, for which they shall\r\nreceive so many Hatchets.\r\n\r\nLastly, the eight chiefe men should see all this performed, or receive the\r\npunishment themselves: for their diligence they should have a red coat, a\r\ncopper chaine, and King James his picture, and be accounted his Noblemen.\r\n\r\nAll this they concluded with a generall assent, and a great shout to\r\nconfirme it: then one of the old men began an Oration, bending his speech\r\nfirst to the old men, then to the young, and then to the women and\r\nchildren, to make them understand how strictly they were to observe these\r\nconditions, and we would defend them from the furie of Powhatan, or any\r\nenemie whatsoever, and furnish them with Copper, Beads, and Hatchets; but\r\nall this was rather for feare Powhatan and we, being so linked together,\r\nwould bring them againe to his subjection; the which to prevent, they did\r\nrather chuse to be protected by us, than tormented by him, whom they held\r\na Tyrant. And thus wee returned againe to James towne.\r\n\r\n                _The benefit of libertie in the planters._\r\n\r\n            _Wiliam Spence the first Farmer in Virginia._ {MN}\r\n\r\nWhen our people were fed out of the common store, and laboured jointly\r\ntogether, glad was he could slip from his labour, or slumber over his\r\ntaske he cared not how, nay, the most honest among them would hardly take\r\nso much true paines in a weeke, as now for themselves they will doe in a\r\nday, neither cared they for the increase, presuming that howsoever the\r\nharvest prospered, the generall store must maintaine them, so that wee\r\nreaped not so much Corne from the labours of thirtie, as now three or\r\nfoure doe provide for themselves. To prevent which, Sir Thomas Dale hath\r\nallotted every man three Acres of cleare ground, in the nature of Farmes,\r\nexcept the Bermudas, who are exempted, but for one moneths service in the\r\nyeere, which must neither bee in seed-time, nor harvest; for which doing,\r\nno other dutie they pay yeerely to the store, but two barrels and a halfe\r\nof Corne {MN} (from all those Farmers, whereof the first was William\r\nSpence, an honest, valiant, and an industrious man, and hath continued\r\nfrom 1607. to this present) from those is expected such a contribution to\r\nthe store, as wee shall neither want for our selves, nor to entertaine our\r\nsupplies; for the rest, they are to worke eleven moneths for the store,\r\nand hath one moneth onely allowed them to get provision to keepe them for\r\ntwelve, except two bushels of Corne they have out of the store; if those\r\ncan live so, why should any feare starving, and it were much better to\r\ndenie them passage, that would not ere they come, bee content to ingage\r\nthemselves to those conditions: for onely from the slothfull and idle\r\ndrones, [IV.115.] and none else, hath sprung the manifold imputations,\r\nVirginia innocently hath undergone; and therefore I would deter such from\r\ncomming here, that cannot well brooke labour, except they will undergoe\r\nmuch punishment and penurie, if they escape the skurvie: but for the\r\nindustrious, there is reward sufficient, and if any thinke there is\r\nnothing but bread, I referre you to his relations that discovered the\r\nCountrie first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              A.D. 1614.\r\n                    _Sir Thomas Smith Treasurer._\r\n\r\n\r\n            The government left to Sir Thomas Dale upon\r\n                Sir Thomas Gates returne for England.\r\n\r\n\r\n               _Captaine Argalls voyage to Port Royall._\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Dale understanding there was a plantation of Frenchmen in the\r\nnorth part of Virginia, about the degrees of 45. sent Captaine Argall to\r\nPort Royall and Sancta Crux, where finding the Frenchmen abroad dispersed\r\nin the Woods, surprized their Ship and Pinnace, which was but newly come\r\nfrom France, wherein was much good apparel, and other provision, which he\r\nbrought to James towne, but the men escaped, and lived among the Salvages\r\nof those Countries.\r\n\r\nIt pleased Sir Thomas Dale, before my returne to England, because I would\r\nbe able to speake somewhat of my owne knowledge, to give mee leave to\r\nvisit Powhatan and his Court: being provided, I had Thomas Salvage with\r\nmee, for my Interpreter, with him and two Salvages for guides, I went from\r\nthe Bermuda in the morning, and came to Matchot the next night, where the\r\nKing lay upon the River of Pamaunke; his entertainment was strange to me,\r\nthe boy he knew well, and told him; My child, I gave you leave, being my\r\nboy, to goe see your friends, and these foure yeeres I have not seene you,\r\nnor heard of my owne man Namoutack I sent to England, though many ships\r\nsince have beene returned thence: Having done with him, hee began with\r\nmee, and demanded for the chaine of pearle he sent his brother Sir Thomas\r\nDale at his first arrivall, which was a token betwixt them, when ever hee\r\nshould send a messenger from himselfe to him, he should weare that chaine\r\nabout his necke, since the peace was concluded, otherwaies he was to binde\r\nhim and send him home.\r\n\r\n                   _Master Hamars journey to Powhatan._\r\n\r\nIt is true Sir Thomas Dale had sent him such word, and gave his Page order\r\nto give it me, but he forgot it, and till this present I never heard of\r\nit, yet I replyed I did know there was such an order, but that was when\r\nupon a sudden he should have occasion to send an Englishman without an\r\nIndian Guide; but if his owne people should conduct his messenger, as two\r\nof his did me who knew my message, it was sufficient; with which answer he\r\nwas contented, and so conducted us to his house, where was a guard of two\r\nhundred Bow-men, that alwaies attend his person. The first thing he did,\r\nhe offered me a pipe of Tobacco, then asked mee how his brother Sir Thomas\r\nDale did, and his daughter, and unknowne sonne, and how they lived, loved\r\nand liked; I told him his brother was well, and his daughter so contented,\r\nshe would not live againe with him; whereat he laughed, and demanded the\r\ncause of my comming: I told him my message was private, and I was to\r\ndeliver it onely to himselfe and Papaschicher, one of my guides that was\r\nacquainted with it; instantly he commanded all out of the house, but onely\r\nhis two Queenes, that alwaies sit by him, and bade me speake on.\r\n\r\n                 _His message to Powhatan._\r\n\r\nI told him, by my Interpreter, Sir Thomas Dale hath sent you two pieces of\r\nCopper, five strings of white and blue Beads, five woodden Combes, ten\r\nFish-hookes, a paire of Knives, and that when you would send for it, hee\r\nwould give you a Grind-stone; all this pleased him: but then I told him\r\nhis brother Dale, hearing of the fame of his youngest daughter, desiring\r\nin any case he would send her by me unto him, in testimonie of his love,\r\nas well for that he intended to marry her, as the desire her sister had to\r\nsee her, because being now one people, and hee desirous for ever to dwell\r\nin his Countrie, he conceived there could not be a truer assurance of\r\npeace and friendship, than in such a naturall band of an united union.\r\n\r\nI needed not entreat his answer by his oft interrupting [IV.116.] mee in\r\nmy speech, and presently with much gravitie he thus replyed.\r\n\r\n                         _Powhatans answer._\r\n\r\nI gladly accept your salute of love and peace, which while I live, I shall\r\nexactly keepe, his pledges thereof I receive with no lesse thanks,\r\nalthough they are not so ample as formerly he had received; but for my\r\ndaughter, I have sold her within this few daies to a great Werowance, for\r\ntwo bushels of Rawrenoke, three daies journie from me. I replyed, I knew\r\nhis greatnesse in restoring the Rawrenoke, might call her againe to\r\ngratifie his brother, and the rather, because she was but twelve yeeres\r\nold, assuring him, besides the band of peace, hee should have for her,\r\nthree times the worth of the Rawrenoke, in Beads, Copper, Hatchets, &c.\r\nHis answer was, he loved his daughter as his life, and though hee had\r\nmany children, hee delighted in none so much as shee, whom he should not\r\noften behold, he could not possibly live, which she living with us he\r\ncould not do, having resolved upon no termes to put himselfe into our\r\nhands, or come amongst us; therefore desired me to urge him no further,\r\nbut returne his brother this answer: That I desire no firmer assurance of\r\nhis friendship, than the promise hee hath made, from me he hath a pledge,\r\none of my daughters, which so long as she lives shall be sufficient, when\r\nshe dies, he shall have another: I hold it not a brotherly part to desire\r\nto bereave me of my two children at once. Farther, tell him though he had\r\nno pledge at all, hee need not distrust any injurie from me or my people;\r\nthere have beene too many of his men and mine slaine, and by my occasion\r\nthere shall never be more, (I which have power to performe it, have said\r\nit) although I should have just cause, for I am now old, & would gladly\r\nend my daies in peace; if you offer me injurie, any countrie is large\r\nenough to goe from you: Thus much I hope will satisfie my brother. Now\r\nbecause you are wearie, and I sleepie, wee will thus end. So commanding us\r\nvictuall and lodging, we rested that night, and the next morning he came\r\nto visit us, and kindly conducted us to the best cheere hee had. William\r\nParker.\r\n\r\n                     _William Parker recovered._\r\n\r\nWhile I here remained, by chance came an Englishman, whom there had beene\r\nsurprized three yeeres agoe at Fort Henry, growne so like, both in\r\ncomplexion and habit like a Salvage, I knew him not, but by his tongue:\r\nhee desired mee to procure his libertie, which I intended, and so farre\r\nurged Powhatan, that he grew discontented, and told mee, You have one of\r\nmy daughters, and I am content, but you cannot see one of your men with\r\nmee, but you must have him away, or breake friendship; if you must needs\r\nhave him, you shall goe home without guides, and if any evill befall you,\r\nthanke your selves: I told him I would, but if I returned not well, hee\r\nmust expect a revenge, and his brother might have just cause to suspect\r\nhim. So in passion he left me till supper, and then gave me such as hee\r\nhad with a cheereful countenance: About midnight hee awaked us, and\r\npromised in the morning my returne with Parker; but I must remember his\r\nbrother to send him ten great piece of Copper, a Shaving-knife, a Frowe,\r\na Grind-stone, a Net, Fish-hookes, and such toies; which lest I should\r\nforget, he caused me write in a table-booke he had; however he got it, it\r\nwas a faire one, I desired hee would give it me; he told me, no, it did\r\nhim much good in shewing to strangers, yet in the morning when we\r\ndeparted, having furnished us well with provision, he gave each of us a\r\nBucks skin as well dressed as could be, and sent two more to his sonne and\r\ndaughter: And so we returned to James towne. Written by Master Ralph Hamor\r\nand John Rolph.\r\n\r\n\r\n         _From a letter of Sir Thomas Dale and Mater Whittakers._\r\n\r\nI have read the substance of this relation, in a Letter written by Sir\r\nThomas Dale, another by Master Whitaker and a third by Master John Rolfe;\r\nhow carefull they were to instruct her in Christianity, and how capable\r\nand desirous shee was thereof, after she had beene some time thus tutored,\r\nshee never had desire to goe to her father, nor could well endure the\r\nsociety of her owne nation: the true affection she constantly bare her\r\nhusband was much, and the strange apparitions and violent passions he\r\nendured for her love, as he deeply protested, was wonderful, and she\r\nopenly renounced her countries [IV.117.] idolatry, confessed the faith of\r\nChrist, and was baptized, but either the coldnesse of the adventurers, or\r\nthe bad usage of that was collected, or both, caused this worthy Knight to\r\nwrite thus. Oh why should so many Princes and Noblemen ingage themselves,\r\nand thereby intermedling herein, have caused a number of soules transport\r\nthemselves, and be transported hither? Why should they, I say, relinquish\r\nthis so glorious an action: for if their ends be to build God a Church,\r\nthey ought to persevere; if otherwise, yet their honour ingageth them to\r\nbe constant; howsoever they stand affected, here is enough to content\r\nthem. These are the things have animated me to stay a little season from\r\nthem, I am bound in conscience to returne unto; leaving all contenting\r\npleasures and mundall delights, to reside here with much turmoile, which I\r\nwill rather doe than see Gods glory diminished, my King and Country\r\ndishonoured, and these poore soules I have in charge revived, which would\r\nquickly happen if I should leave them; so few I have with me fit to\r\ncommand or manage the businesse: Master Whitaker their Preacher\r\ncomplaineth, and much museth, that so few of our English Ministers, that\r\nwere so hot against the surplice and subscription come hether, where\r\nneither is spoken of. Doe they not wilfully hide their talents, or keepe\r\nthemselves at home, for feare of losing a few pleasures; be there not any\r\namong them of Moses his minde, and of the Apostles, that forsooke all to\r\nfollow Christ, but I refer them to the Judge of all hearts, and to the\r\nKing that shall reward every one according to his talent. From Virginia,\r\nJune 18. 1614.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe businesse being brought to this perfection, Captaine Argall returned\r\nfor England, in the latter end of June, 1614. arriving in England, and\r\nbringing this good tidings to the Councell and company by the assistances\r\nof Sir Thomas Gates, that also had returned from Virginia but the March\r\nbefore; it was presently concluded, that to supply this good successe with\r\nall expedition, the standing Lottery should be drawne with all diligent\r\nconveniency, and that posterity may remember upon occasion to use the like\r\naccording to the declaration, I thinke it not amisse to remember thus\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A.D. 1615.\r\n                   _Sir Thomas Smith Treasurer._\r\n\r\n\r\n           The Contents of the declaration of the Lottery\r\n                     published by the Counsell.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is apparent to the world, by how many former Proclamations, we\r\nmanifested our intents, to have drawn out the great standing Lottery long\r\nbefore this, which not falling out as we desired, and others expected,\r\nwhose monies are adventured therein, we thought good therefore for the\r\navoiding all unjust and sinister constructions, to resolve the doubts of\r\nall indifferent minded, in three speciall points for their better\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nBut ere I goe any farther, let us remember there was a running Lottery,\r\nused a long time in Saint Pauls Church-yard, where this stood, that\r\nbrought into the Treasury good summes of mony dayly, though the Lot was\r\nbut small.\r\n\r\nNow for the points, the first is, for as much as the Adventurers came in\r\nso slackly for the yeere past, without prejudice to the generality, in\r\nlosing the blankes and prises, we were forced to petition to the\r\nhonourable Lords, who out of their noble care to further this Plantation,\r\nhave recommended their Letsenters to the Countries, Cities, and good\r\ntownes in England, which we hope by adding in their voluntary Adventurers,\r\nwill sufficiently supply us.\r\n\r\nThe second for satisfaction to all honest well affected minds, is, that\r\nthough this expectation answer not our hopes, yet wee have not failed in\r\nour Christian care, the good of that Colony, to whom we have lately sent\r\ntwo sundry supplies, and were they but now supplied with more hands, wee\r\nshould soone resolve the division of the Country by Lot, and so lessen the\r\ngenerall charge.\r\n\r\nThe third is our constant resolution, that seeing our credits are so farre\r\ningaged to the honourable Lords and [IV.118.] the whole State, for the\r\ndrawing this great Lottery, which we intend shall be without delay, the\r\n26. of June next, desiring all such as have undertaken with bookes to\r\nsolicit their friends, that they will not with-hold their monies till the\r\nlast moneth be expired, lest we be unwillingly forced to proportion a\r\nlesse value and number of our Blankes and Prises which hereafter\r\nfolloweth.\r\n\r\n                             Welcomes.\r\n\r\n                                                          Crownes.\r\n To him that first shall be drawne out with a\r\n blanke,                                                    100\r\n\r\n To the second,                                              50\r\n\r\n To the third,                                               25\r\n\r\n To him that every day during the drawing of this\r\n Lottery, shall bee first drawne out with a blanke,          10\r\n\r\n                  Prizes                  Crownes.\r\n\r\n    1 Great Prize of                       4500\r\n    2 Great Prizes, each of                2000\r\n    4 Great Prizes, each of                1000\r\n    6 Great

ship, beat too and againe before\r\npoint Comfort, and at last sent a shore their boat, as desirous of a\r\nPilot. Captaine James Davis the governor, immediatly gave them one, but he\r\nwas no sooner in the boat, but away they went with him, leaving three of\r\ntheir companions behind them; this sudden accident occasioned some\r\ndistrust, and a strict examination of those three thus left, yet with as\r\ngood usage as our estate could afford them. They only confessed having\r\nlost their Admirall, accident had forced them into those parts, and two of\r\nthem were Captaines, and in chiefe authority in the fleet: thus they lived\r\ntill one of them was found to be an Englishman, and had been the\r\nSpaniards Pilot for England in 88. and having here induced some\r\nmale-contents, to beleeve his projects, to run away with a small barke,\r\nwhich was apprehended, some executed, and he expecting but the Hangmans\r\ncurtesie, directly confessed that two or three Spanish ships was at Sea,\r\npurposely to discover the estate of the Colony, but their Commission was\r\nnot to be opened till they arrived in the Bay, so that of any thing more\r\nhe was utterly ignorant. One of the Spaniards at last dyed, the other was\r\nsent for England but this reprieved, till Sir Thomas Dale hanged him at\r\nSea in his voyage home-ward; the English Pilot they carried for Spaine,\r\nwhom after a long time imprisonment, with much sute was returned for\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n                                 1616.\r\n                      _Sir Thomas Smith Treasurer._\r\n\r\nWhilst those things were effecting, Sir Thomas Dale, having setled to his\r\nthinking all things in good order, made choice of one Master George\r\nYearly, to be Deputy-Governour in his absence, and so returned for\r\nEngland, accompanied with Pocahontas the Kings Daughter, and Master Rolfe\r\nher husband, and arrived at Plimmoth the 12. of June, 1616.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                The government left to Captaine Yearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  _A digression._\r\n\r\nNow a little to commentary upon all these proceedings, let me leave but\r\nthis as a caveat by the way; if the alteration of government hath\r\nsubverted great Empires, how dangerous is it then in the infancy of a\r\ncommon-weale? The multiplicity of Governors is a great damage to any\r\nState, but uncertaine daily changes are burdensome, because their\r\nentertainments are chargeable, and many will make hay whilst the sunne\r\ndoth shine, how ever it shall fare with the generality.\r\n\r\nThis deare bought Land with so much bloud and cost, hath onely made some\r\nfew rich, and all the rest losers. But it was intended at the first, the\r\nfirst undertakers should be first preferred and rewarded, and the first\r\nadventurers satisfied, and they of all the rest are the most neglected;\r\nand those that never adventured a groat, never see the Country, nor ever\r\ndid any service for it, imploied in their places, adorned with their\r\ndeserts, and inriched with their ruines; and when they are fed fat, then\r\nin commeth others so leane as they were, who through their omnipotency doe\r\nas much. Thus what one Officer doth, another undoth, only ayming at their\r\nowne ends, thinking all the world derides his dignity, cannot fill his\r\nCoffers being in authority with any thing. Every man hath His minde free,\r\nbut he can never be a true member to that [IV. 120.] estate, that to\r\nenrich himselfe beggers all the Countrie. Which bad course, there are many\r\nyet in this noble plantation, whose true honour and worth as much scornes\r\nit, as the others loves it; for the Nobilitie and Gentrie, there is scarce\r\nany of them expects any thing but the prosperitie of the action: and there\r\nare some Merchants and others, I am confidently perswaded, doe take more\r\ncare and paines, nay, and at their continuall great charge, than they\r\ncould be hired to for the love of money, so honestly regarding the\r\ngenerall good of this great worke, they would hold it worse than\r\nsacrilege, to wrong it but a shilling, or extort upon the common souldier\r\na penny. But to the purpose, and to follow the Historie.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _The government of Captaine Yearley._\r\n\r\n            _Twelve Salvages slaine, Twelve prisoners taken,\r\n                    and peace concluded._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                   _Eleven men cast away._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\n                     _A bad president._ {MN-3}\r\n\r\nMr. George Yearly now invested Deputie Governour by Sir Thomas Dale,\r\napplied himselfe for the most part in planting Tobacco, as the most\r\npresent commoditie they could devise for a present gaine, so that every\r\nman betooke himselfe to the best place he could for the purpose: now\r\nthough Sir Thomas Dale had caused such an abundance of corne to be\r\nplanted, that every man had sufficient, yet the supplies were sent us,\r\ncame so unfurnished, as quickly eased us of our superfluitie. To relieve\r\ntheir necessities, he sent to the Chickahamanias for the tribute Corne Sir\r\nThomas Dale and Captaine Argall had conditioned for with them: But such a\r\nbad answer they returned him, that hee drew together one hundred of his\r\nbest shot, with whom he went to Chickahamania; the people in some places\r\nused him indifferently, but in most places with much scorne and contempt,\r\ntelling him he was but Sir Thomas Dales man, and they had payed his Master\r\naccording to condition, but to give any to him they had no such order,\r\nneither would they obey him as they had done his Master; after he had told\r\nthem his authoritie, and that he had the same power to enforce them that\r\nDale had, they dared him to come on shore to fight, presuming more of his\r\nnot daring, than their owne valours. Yearly seeing their insolencies, made\r\nno great difficultie to goe on shore at Ozinies, and they as little to\r\nincounter him: but marching from thence towards Mamanahunt, they put\r\nthemselves in the same order they see us, lead by their Captaine\r\nKissanacomen, Governour of Ozinies, & so marched close along by us, each\r\nas threatning other who should first begin. But that night we quartered\r\nagainst Mamanahunt, and they passed the River. The next day we followed\r\nthem; there are few places in Virginia had then more plaine ground\r\ntogether, nor more plentie of Corne, which although it was but newly\r\ngathered, yet they had hid it in the woods where we could not finde it: a\r\ngood time we spent thus in arguing the cause, the Salvages without feare\r\nstanding in troupes amongst us, seeming as if their countenances had beene\r\nsufficient to dant us: what other practises they had I know not; but to\r\nprevent the worst, our Captaine caused us all to make ready, and upon the\r\nword, to let flie among them, where he appointed: others also he commanded\r\nto seize on them they could for prisoners; all which being done according\r\nto our direction, {MN-1} the Captaine gave the word, and wee presently\r\ndischarged, where twelve lay, some dead, the rest for life sprawling on\r\nthe ground, twelve more we tooke prisoners, two whereof were brothers, two\r\nof their eight Elders, the one tooke by Sergeant Boothe, the other by\r\nRobert a Polonian; Neere one hundred bushels of Corne we had for their\r\nransomes, which was promised the Souldiers for a reward, but it was not\r\nperformed: now Opechankanough had agreed with our Captaine for the\r\nsubjecting of those people, that neither hee nor Powhatan could ever bring\r\nto their obedience, and that he should make no peace with them without his\r\nadvice: in our returne by Ozinies with our prisoners wee met\r\nOpechankanough, who with much adoe, fained with what paines hee had\r\nprocured their peace, the which to requite, they called him the King of\r\nOzinies, and brought him from all parts many presents of Beads, Copper,\r\nand such trash as they had; here as at many other times wee were beholding\r\nto Captaine Henry Spilman our Interpreter, a Gentleman had lived long time\r\nin this Countrie, and sometimes a prisoner among the Salvages, and done\r\nmuch good service, though but badly rewarded. From hence we marcht [IV.121]\r\ntowards James towne, {MN-2} we had three Boats loaded with Corne and other\r\nluggage, the one of them being more willing to be at James towne with the\r\nnewes than the other, was overset, and eleven men cast away with the Boat,\r\nCorne and all their provision; notwithstanding this put all the rest of\r\nthe Salvages in that feare, especially in regard of the great league we\r\nhad with Opechankanough, that we followed our labours quietly, and in such\r\nsecuritie, that divers salvages of other Nations, daily frequented us with\r\nwhat provisions they could get, and would guide our men on hunting, and\r\noft hunt for us themselves. {MN-3} Captaine Yearly had a Salvage or two so\r\nwell trained up to their peeces, they were as expert as any of the\r\nEnglish, and one hee kept purposely to kill him fowle. There were divers\r\nothers had Salvages in like manner for their men. Thus we lived together,\r\nas if wee had beene one people, all the time Captaine Yearley staied with\r\nus, but such grudges and discontents daily increased among our selves,\r\nthat upon the arrivall of Captaine Argall, sent by the Councell and\r\nCompanie to bee our Governour, Captaine Yearley returned for England in\r\nthe yeere 1617. From the writings of Captaine Nathaniel Powell, William\r\nCantrill, Sergeant Boothe, Edward Gurganey.\r\n\r\n                    _Pocahontas instructions._\r\n\r\nDuring this time, the Lady Rebecca, alias Pocahontas, daughter to\r\nPowhatan, by the diligent care of Master John Rolfe her husband and his\r\nfriends, was taught to speake such English as might well bee understood,\r\nwell instructed in Christianitie, and was become very formall and civill\r\nafter our English manner; shee had also by him a childe which she loved\r\nmost dearely, and the Treasurer and Company tooke order both for the\r\nmaintenance of her and it, besides there were divers persons of great\r\nranke and qualitie had beene very kinde to her; and before she arrived at\r\nLondon, Captaine Smith to deserve her former courtesies, made her\r\nqualities knowne to the Queenes most excellent Majestie and her Court, and\r\nwrit a little booke to this effect to the Queene: An abstract whereof\r\nfolloweth.\r\n\r\n\r\n             To the most high and vertuous Princesse Queene\r\n                        Anne of Great Brittanie.\r\n\r\nMost admired Queene,\r\n\r\nThe love I beare my God, my King and Countrie, hath so oft emboldened mee\r\nin the worst of extreme dangers, that now honestie doth constraine mee\r\npresume thus farre beyond my selfe, to present your Majestic this short\r\ndiscourse: if ingratitude be a deadly poyson to all honest vertues, I must\r\nbee guiltie of that crime if I should omit any meanes to bee thankfull. So\r\nit is,\r\n\r\n             _A relation to Queene Anne of Pocahontas._\r\n\r\nThat some ten yeeres agoe being in Virginia, and taken prisoner by the\r\npower of Powhatan their chiefe King, I received from this great Salvage\r\nexceeding great courtesie, especially from his sonne Nantaquans, the most\r\nmanliest, comeliest, boldest spirit, I ever saw in a Salvage, and his\r\nsister Pocahontas, the Kings most deare and wel-beloved daughter, being\r\nbut a childe of twelve or thirteene yeeres of age, whose compassionate\r\npitifull heart, of my desperate estate, gave me much cause to respect her:\r\nI being the first Christian this proud King and his grim attendants ever\r\nsaw: and thus inthralled in their barbarous power, I cannot say I felt the\r\nleast occasion of want that was in the power of those my mortall foes to\r\nprevent, notwithstanding al their threats. After some six weeks fatting\r\namongst those Salvage Courtiers, at the minute of my execution, she\r\nhazarded the beating out of her owne braines to save mine, and not onely\r\nthat, but so prevailed with her father, that I was safely conducted to\r\nJames towne, where I found about eight and thirtie miserable poore and\r\nsicke creatures, to keepe possession of all those large territories of\r\nVirginia, such was the weaknesse of this poore Commonwealth, as had the\r\nSalvages not fed us, we directly had starved.\r\n\r\nAnd this reliefe, most gracious Queene, was commonly [IV.122.] brought us\r\nby this Lady Pocahontas, notwithstanding all these passages when inconstant\r\nFortune turned our peace to warre, this tender Virgin would still not spare\r\nto dare to visit us, and by her our jarres have beene oft appeased, and our\r\nwants still supplyed; were it the policie of her father thus to imploy her,\r\nor the ordinance of God thus to make her his instrument, or her\r\nextraordinarie affection to our Nation, I know not: but of this I am sure;\r\nwhen her father with the utmost of his policie and power, sought to\r\nsurprize mee, having but eighteene with mee, the darke night could not\r\naffright her from comming through the irkesome woods, and with watered eies\r\ngave me intelligence, with her best advice to escape his furie; which had\r\nhee knowne, hee had surely slaine her. James towne with her wild traine she\r\nas freely frequented, as her fathers habitation; and during the time of two\r\nor three yeeres, she next under God, was still the instrument to preserve\r\nthis Colonie from death, famine and utter confusion, which if in those\r\ntimes had once beene dissolved, Virginia might have line as it was at our\r\nfirst arrivall to this day. Since then, this businesse having beene turned\r\nand varied by many accidents from that I left it at: it is most certaine,\r\nafter a long and troublesome warre after my departure, betwixt her father\r\nand our Colonie, all which time shee was not heard of, about two yeeres\r\nafter shee her selfe was taken prisoner, being so detained neere two yeeres\r\nlonger, the Colonie by that meanes was relieved, peace concluded, and at\r\nlast rejecting her barbarous condition, was maried to an English Gentleman,\r\nwith whom at this present she is in England; the first Christian ever of\r\nthat Nation, the first Virginian ever spake English, or had a childe in\r\nmariage by an Englishman, a matter surely, if my meaning bee truly\r\nconsidered and well understood, worthy a Princes understanding.\r\n\r\nThus most gracious Lady, I have related to your Majestie, what at your\r\nbest leasure our approved Histories will account you at large, and done in\r\nthe time of your Majesties life, and however this might bee presented you\r\nfrom a more worthy pen, it cannot from a more honest heart, as yet I never\r\nbegged any thing of the state, or any, and it is my want of abilitie and\r\nher exceeding desert, your birth, meanes and authentic, her birth, vertue,\r\nwant and simplicitie, doth make mee thus bold, humbly to beseech your\r\nMajestie to take this knowledge of her, though it be from one so unworthy\r\nto be the reporter, as my selfe, her husbands estate not being able to\r\nmake her fit to attend your Majestie: the most and least I can doe, is to\r\ntell you this, because none so oft hath tried it as my selfe, and the\r\nrather being of so great a spirit, how ever her stature: if she should not\r\nbe well received, seeing this Kingdome may rightly have a Kingdome by her\r\nmeanes; her present love to us and Christianitie, might turne to such\r\nscorne and furie, as to divert all this good to the worst of evill, where\r\nfinding so great a Queene should doe her some honour more than she can\r\nimagine, for being so kinde to your servants and subjects, would so ravish\r\nher with content, as endeare her dearest bloud to effect that, your\r\nMajestie and all the Kings honest subjects most earnestly desire: And so\r\nI humbly kisse your gracious hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n           _Pocahontas meeting in England with Captaine Smith._\r\n\r\nBeing about this time preparing to set saile for New-England, I could not\r\nstay to doe her that service I desired, and she well deserved; but hearing\r\nshee was at Branford with divers of my friends, I went to see her: After a\r\nmodest salutation, without any word, she turned about, obscured her face,\r\nas not seeming well contented; and in that humour her husband, with divers\r\nothers, we all left her two or three houres, repenting my selfe to have\r\nwrit she could speake English. But not long after, she began to talke, and\r\nremembred mee well what courtesies shee had done: saying, You did promise\r\nPowhatan what was yours should bee his, and he the like to you; you called\r\nhim father being in his land a stranger, and by the same reason so must I\r\ndoe you: which though I would have excused, I durst not allow of that\r\ntitle, because she was a Kings daughter; with a well set countenance she\r\nsaid, Were you not afraid to come into my fathers Countrie, and caused\r\nfeare in him and all his people (but mee) and feare you here I should call\r\nyou father; I tell [IV.123.] you then I will, and you shall call mee\r\nchilde, and so I will bee for ever and ever your Countrieman. They did\r\ntell us alwaies you were dead, and I knew no other till I came to Plimoth;\r\nyet Powhatan did command Uttamatomakkin to seeke you, and know the truth,\r\nbecause your Countriemen will lie much.\r\n\r\n          _Uttamacomack, observations of his usage._\r\n\r\nThis Salvage, one of Powhatans Councell, being amongst them held an\r\nunderstanding fellow; the King purposely sent him, as they say, to number\r\nthe people here, and informe him well what wee were and our state.\r\nArriving at Plimoth, according to his directions, he got a long sticke,\r\nwhereon by notches hee did thinke to have kept the number of all the men\r\nhee could see, but he was quickly wearie of that taske: Comming to London,\r\nwhere by chance I met him, having renewed our acquaintance, where many\r\nwere desirous to heare and see his behaviour, hee told me Powhatan did bid\r\nhim to finde me out, to shew him our God, the King, Queene, and Prince, I\r\nso much had told them of: Concerning God, I told him the best I could, the\r\nKing I heard he had seene, and the rest hee should see when he would; he\r\ndenied ever to have seene the King, till by circumstances he was satisfied\r\nhe had: Then he replyed very sadly, You gave Powhatan a white Dog, which\r\nPowhatan fed as himselfe, but your King gave me nothing, and I am better\r\nthan your white Dog.\r\n\r\n             _Pocahontas her entertainment with the Queene._\r\n\r\nThe small time I staid in London, divers Courtiers and others, my\r\nacquaintances, hath gone with mee to see her, that generally concluded,\r\nthey did thinke God had a great hand in her conversion, and they have\r\nseene many English Ladies worse favoured, proportioned and behavioured,\r\nand as since I have heard, it pleased both the King and Queenes Majestie\r\nhonourably to esteeme her, accompanied with that honourable Lady the Lady\r\nDe la Ware, and that honourable Lord her husband, and divers other persons\r\nof good qualities, both publikely at the maskes and otherwise, to her\r\ngreat satisfaction and content, which doubtlesse she would have deserved,\r\nhad she lived to arrive in Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            A.D. 1617.\r\n                 _Sir Thomas Smith Treasurer._\r\n\r\n\r\n          The government devolved to Captaine Samuel\r\n                         Argall, 1617.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _The death of Pocahontas._\r\n\r\n         1000. _bushels of Corne from the Salvages._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThe Treasurer, Councell and Companie, having well furnished Captaine\r\nSamuel Argall, the Lady Pocahontas alias Rebecca, with her husband and\r\nothers, in the good ship called the George, it pleased God at Gravesend to\r\ntake this young Lady to his mercie, where shee made not more sorrow for\r\nher unexpected death, than joy to the beholders, to heare and see her make\r\nso religious and godly an end. Her little childe Thomas Rolfe therefore\r\nwas left at Plimoth with Sir Lewis Stukly, that desired the keeping of it.\r\nCaptaine Hamar his vice-Admirall was gone before, but hee found him at\r\nPlimoth. In March they set saile 1617. and in May he arrived at James\r\ntowne, where hee was kindly entertained by Captaine Yearley and his\r\nCompanie in a martiall order, whose right hand file was led by an Indian.\r\nIn James towne he found but five or six houses, the Church downe, the\r\nPalizado's broken, the Bridge in pieces, the Well of fresh water spoiled;\r\nthe Store-house they used for the Church, the market-place, and streets,\r\nand all other spare places planted with Tobacco, the Salvages as frequent\r\nin their houses as themselves, whereby they were become expert in our\r\narmes, and had a great many in their custodie and possession, the Colonie\r\ndispersed all about, planting Tobacco. Captaine Argall not liking those\r\nproceedings, altered them agreeable to his owne minde, taking the best\r\norder he could for repairing those defects which did exceedingly trouble\r\nus; we were constrained every yeere to build and repaire our old Cottages,\r\nwhich were alwaies a decaying in all places of the Countrie, yea, the very\r\nCourts of Guard built by Sir Thomas Dale, was ready to fall, and the\r\nPalizado's not sufficient to keepe out Hogs. Their number of people were\r\nabout 400. but not past 200. fit for husbandry and tillage: we found there\r\nin all one hundred twentie eight cattell, and fourescore and eight Goats,\r\nbesides innumerable numbers of Swine, and good plentie of Corne in some\r\nplaces, yet the next yeere the [IV.124.] Captaine sent out a Frigat and a\r\nPinnace, {MN} that brought us neere six hundred bushels more, which did\r\ngreatly relieve the whole Colonie: For from the tenants wee seldome had\r\nabove foure hundred bushels of rent Corne to the store, and there was not\r\nremaining of the Companies companie, past foure and fiftie men, women and\r\nChildren.\r\n\r\n                             1618.\r\n                  _Sir Thomas Smith Treasurer._\r\n\r\nThis yeere having planted our fields, came a great drought, and such a\r\ncruell storme of haile, which did such spoile both to the Corne and\r\nTobacco, that wee reaped but small profit, the Magazine that came in the\r\nGeorge, being five moneths in her passage, proved very badly conditioned,\r\nbut ere she arrived, we had gathered and made up our Tobacco, the best at\r\nthree shillings the pound, the rest at eighteene pence.\r\n\r\n            _The death of Lord la Ware._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n          _They are relieved in New-England._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nTo supply us, the Councell and Company with all possible care and\r\ndiligence, furnished a good ship of some two hundred and fiftie tunne,\r\nwith two hundred people and the Lord la Ware. They set saile in Aprill,\r\nand tooke their course by the westerne Iles, where the Governour of the\r\nIle of Saint Michael received the Lord la Ware, and honourably feasted\r\nhim, with all the content hee could give him. Going from thence, they were\r\nlong troubled with contrary winds, in which time many of them fell very\r\nsicke, thirtie died, {MN-1} one of which number was that most honourable\r\nLord Governour the Lord la Ware, whose most noble and generous\r\ndisposition, is well knowne to his great cost, had beene most forward in\r\nthis businesse for his Countries good: Yet this tender state of Virginia\r\nwas not growne to that maturitie, to maintaine such state and pleasure as\r\nwas fit for such a personage, with so brave and great attendance: for some\r\nsmall number of adventrous Gentlemen to make discoveries, and lie in\r\nGarrison, ready upon any occasion to keepe in feare the inconstant\r\nSalvages, nothing were more requisite, but to have more to wait & play\r\nthan worke, or more commanders and officers than industrious labourers was\r\nnot so necessarie: for in Virginia, a plaine Souldier that can use a\r\nPick-axe and spade, is better than five Knights, although they were\r\nKnights that could breake a Lance; for men of great place, not inured to\r\nthose incounters; when they finde things not sutable, grow many times so\r\ndiscontented, they forget themselves, & oft become so carelesse, that a\r\ndiscontented melancholy brings them to much sorrow, and to others much\r\nmiserie. At last they stood in for the coast of New-England, where they\r\nmet a small Frenchman, rich of Bevers and other Furres. {MN-2} Though wee\r\nhad here but small knowledge of the coast nor countrie, yet they tooke\r\nsuch an abundance of Fish and Fowle, and so well refreshed themselves\r\nthere with wood and water, as by the helpe of God thereby, having beene at\r\nSea sixteene weekes, got to Virginia, who without this reliefe had beene\r\nin great danger to perish. The French-men made them such a feast, with\r\nsuch an abundance of varietie of Fish, Fowle and Fruits, as they all\r\nadmired, and little expected that wild wildernesse could affoord such\r\nwonderfull abundance of plentie. In this ship came about two hundred men,\r\nbut very little provision, and the ship called the Treasurer came in\r\nagaine not long after with fortie passengers; the Lord la Wares ship lying\r\nin Virginia three moneths, wee victualled her with threescore bushels of\r\nCorne, and eight Hogsheads of flesh, besides other victuall she spent\r\nwhilest they tarried there: this ship brought us advice that great\r\nmultitudes were a preparing in England to bee sent, and relied much upon\r\nthat victuall they should finde here: whereupon our Captaine called a\r\nCouncell, and writ to the Councell here in England the estate of the\r\nColonie, and what a great miserie would insue, if they sent not provision\r\nas well as people; and what they did suffer for want of skilfull\r\nhusbandmen, and meanes to set their Ploughs on worke, having as good\r\nground as any man can desire, and about fortie Bulls and Oxen, but they\r\nwanted men to bring them to labour, and Irons for the Ploughs, and\r\nharnesse for the Cattell. Some thirtie or fortie acres wee had sowne with\r\none Plough, but it stood so long on the ground before it was reaped, it\r\nwas most shaken, and the rest spoiled with the Cattell and Rats [IV.125.]\r\nin the Barne, but no better Corne could bee for the quantitie.\r\n\r\n    _Richard Killingbeck and foure other murdered by the Salvages._\r\n\r\n               _Their Church and Storehouse._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n     _Fairfax, three children and two boys also murdered._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nRichard Killingbeck being with the Captaine at Kekoughtan, desired leave\r\nto returne to his wife at Charles hundred, hee went to James towne by\r\nwater, there he got foure more to goe with him by land, but it proved that\r\nhe intended to goe trade with the Indies of Chickahamania, where making\r\nshew of the great quantitie of trucke they had, which the Salvages\r\nperceiving, partly for their trucke, partly for revenge of some friends\r\nthey pretended should have beene slaine by Captaine Yearley, one of them\r\nwith an English peece shot Killingbeck dead, the other Salvages assaulted\r\nthe rest and slew them, stripped them, and tooke what they had: But\r\nfearing this murther would come to light, and might cause them to suffer\r\nfor it, would now proceed to the perfection of villanie; {MN-1} for\r\npresently they robbed their Machacomocko house of the towne, stole all the\r\nIndian treasure thereout, and fled into the woods, as other Indians\r\nrelated. {MN-2} On Sunday following, one Farfax that dwelt a mile from the\r\ntowne, going to Church, left his wife and three small children safe at\r\nhome, as he thought, and a young youth: she supposing praier to be done,\r\nleft the children, and went to meet her husband; presently after came\r\nthree or foure of those fugitive Salvages, entred the house, and slew a\r\nboy and three children, and also another youth that stole out of the\r\nChurch in praier time, meeting them, was likewise murdered. Of this\r\ndisaster the Captaine sent to Opechankanough for satisfaction, but he\r\nexcused the matter, as altogether ignorant of it, at the same time the\r\nSalvages that were robbed were complaining to Opechankanough, and much\r\nfeared the English would bee revenged on them, so that Opechankanough\r\nsent to Captaine Argall, to assure him the peace should never be broken by\r\nhim, desiring that he would not revenge the injurie of those fugitives\r\nupon the innocent people of that towne, which towne he should have, and\r\nsent him a basket of earth, as possession given of it, and promised, so\r\nsoone as possibly they could catch these robbers, to send him their heads\r\nfor satisfaction, but he never performed it.

Itopatin his second brother succeeds\r\nhim, and both hee and Opechankanough have confirmed our former league. On\r\nthe eleventh of May, about ten of the clocke in the night, happened a most\r\nfearefull tempest, but it continued not past halfe an houre, {MN-2} which\r\npowred downe hailestones eight or nine inches about, that none durst goe\r\nout of their doores, and though it tore the barke and leaves of the trees,\r\nyet wee finde not they hurt either man or beast; it fell onely about James\r\ntowne, for but a mile to the East, and twentie to the West there was no\r\nhaile at all. Thus in peace every man followed his building and planting\r\nwithout any accidents worthy of note. Some private differences happened\r\nbetwixt Captaine Bruster and Captaine Argall, and Captaine Argall and the\r\nCompanie here in England; but of them I am not fully informed, neither are\r\nthey here for any use, and therefore unfit to be remembred. In December\r\none Captaine Stallings, an old planter in those parts, being imployed by\r\nthem of the West countrie for a fishing voyage, in New-England, fell foule\r\nof a Frenchman whom hee tooke, leaving his owne ship to returne for\r\nEngland, himselfe with a small companie remained in the French barke, some\r\nsmall time after upon the coast, and thence returned to winter in Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           The government surrendred to Sir George [IV.126.]\r\n                             Yearley.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Waraskoyack planted._ {MN}\r\n\r\nFor to begin with the yeere of our Lord, 1619. there arrived a little\r\nPinnace privatly from England about Easter for Captaine Argall, who taking\r\norder for his affaires, within foure or five daies returned in her, and\r\nleft for his Deputy, Captaine Nathaniel Powell. On the eighteenth of\r\nAprill, which was but ten or twelve daies after, arrived Sir George\r\nYearley, by whom we understood Sir Edwin Sands was chosen Treasurer, and\r\nMaster John Farrar his Deputy, and what great supplies was a preparing to\r\nbe sent us, which did ravish us so much with joy and content, we thought\r\nour selves now fully satisfied, for our long toile and labours, and as\r\nhappy men as any in the world. Notwithstanding, such an accident hapned\r\nCaptaine Stallings, the next day his ship was cast away, and he not long\r\nafter slaine in a private quarrell. Sir George Yearly to beginne his\r\ngovernment, added to be of his councell, Captaine Francis West, Captaine\r\nNathaniel Powell, Master John Pory, Master John Rolfe, and Master William\r\nWickam, and Master Samuel Macocke, and propounded to have a generall\r\nassembly with all expedition. Upon the twelfth of this Moneth, came in a\r\nPinnace of Captaine Bargraves, and on the seventeenth Captaine Lownes, and\r\none Master Evans, {MN} who intended to plant themselves at Waraskoyack,\r\nbut now Ophechankanough will not come at us, that causes us suspect his\r\nformer promises.\r\n\r\n              _A barrell they account foure bushels._ {MN}\r\n\r\nIn May came in the Margaret of Bristoll, with foure and thirty men, all\r\nwell and in health, and also many devout gifts, and we were much troubled\r\nin examining some scandalous letters sent into England, to disgrace this\r\nCountry with barrennesse, to discourage the adventurers, and so bring it\r\nand us to ruine and confusion; notwithstanding, we finde by them of best\r\nexperience, an industrious man not other waies imploied, may well tend\r\nfoure akers of Corne, and 1000. plants of Tobacco, and where they say an\r\naker will yeeld but three or foure barrels, we have ordinarily foure or\r\nfive, but of new ground six, seven, and eight, and a barrell of Pease and\r\nBeanes, which we esteeme as good as two of Corne, which is after thirty or\r\nforty bushels an aker, so that one man may provide Corne for five, and\r\napparell for two by the profit of his Tobacco; {MN} they say also English\r\nWheat will yeeld but sixteene bushels an aker, and we have reaped thirty:\r\nbesides to manure the Land, no place hath more white and blew Marble than\r\nhere, had we but Carpenters to build and make Carts and Ploughs, and\r\nskilfull men that know how to use them, and traine up our cattell to draw\r\nthem, which though we indevour to effect, yet our want of experience\r\nbrings but little to perfection but planting Tobaco, and yet of that many\r\nare so covetous to have much, they make little good; besides there are so\r\nmany sofisticating Tobaco-mungers in England, were it never so bad, they\r\nwould sell it for Verinas, and the trash that remaineth should be Virginia,\r\nsuch devilish bad mindes we know some of our owne Country-men doe beare,\r\nnot onely to the businesse, but also to our mother England her selfe; could\r\nthey or durst they as freely defame her.\r\n\r\n                  _The time of Parlament._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                 _Foure corporations named._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\n                  _Captaine Wards exploit._ {MN-3}\r\n\r\nThe 25. of June came in the Triall with Corne and Cattell all in safety,\r\nwhich tooke from us cleerely all feare of famine; {MN-1} then our\r\ngovernour and councell caused Burgesses to be chosen in all places, and\r\nmet at a generall Assembly, where all matters were debated though\r\nexpedient for the good of the Colony, and Captaine Ward was sent to\r\nMonahigan in new England, to fish in May, and returned the latter end of\r\nMay, but to small purpose, for they wanted Salt: the George also was sent\r\nto New-found-land with the Cape Merchant, there she bought fish, that\r\ndefraied her charges, and made a good voyage in seven weekes. About the\r\nlast of August came in a dutch man of warre that sold us twenty Negars,\r\nand Japazous King of Patawomeck, came to James towne, to desire two ships\r\nto come trade in his River, for a more plentifull yeere of Corne had not\r\nbeene in a long time, yet very contagious, and by the trechery of one\r\nPoule, in a manner turned heathen, wee were [IV.127.] very jealous the\r\nSalvages would surprize us. {MN-2} The Governours have bounded foure\r\nCorporations; which is the Companies, the University, the Governours and\r\nGleabe land: Ensigne Wil. Spencer, & Thomas Barret a Sergeant, with some\r\nothers of the ancient Planters being set free, we are the first farmers\r\nthat went forth, and have chosen places to their content, so that now\r\nknowing their owne land, they strive who should exceed in building and\r\nplanting. The fourth of November the Bona nova came in with all her people\r\nlusty and well; not long after one Master Dirmer sent out by some of\r\nPlimoth for New-England, arrived in a Barke of five tunnes, and returned\r\nthe next Spring; notwithstanding the ill rumours of the unwholsomnesse of\r\nJames towne, the new commers that were planted at old Paspaheghe, little\r\nmore then a mile from it, had their healths better then any in the\r\nCountry. {MN-3} In December Captaine Ward returned from Patawomeck, the\r\npeople there dealt falsly with him, so that hee tooke 800. bushels of\r\nCorne from them perforce. Captaine Woddiffe of Bristol came in not long\r\nafter, with all his people lusty and in health, and we had two particular\r\nGovernors sent us, under the titles of Deputies to the Company, the one to\r\nhave charge of the Colledge Lands, the other of the Companies: Now you are\r\nto understand, that because there have beene many complaints against the\r\nGovernors, Captaines, and Officers in Virginia, for buying and selling men\r\nand boies, or to bee set over from one to another for a yeerely rent, was\r\nheld in England a thing most intolerable, or that the tenants or lawfull\r\nservants should be put from their places, or abridged their Covenants, was\r\nso odious, that the very report thereof brought a great scandall to the\r\ngenerall action. The Councell in England did send many good and worthy\r\ninstructions for the amending those abuses, and appointed a hundred men\r\nshould at the Companies charge be allotted and provided to serve and\r\nattend the Governour during the time of his government, which number he\r\nwas to make good at his departure, and leave to his Successor in like\r\nmanner, fifty to the Deputy-Governour of the College land, and fifty to\r\nthe Deputy of the Companies land, fifty to the Treasurer, to the Secretary\r\nfive and twenty, and more to the Marshall and Cape merchant; which they\r\nare also to leave to their successors, and likewise to every particular\r\nOfficer such a competency, as he might live well in his Office, without\r\noppressing any under their charge, which good law I pray God it be well\r\nobserved, and then we may truly say in Virginia, we are the most happy\r\npeople in the world. By me John Rolfe.\r\n\r\n                 _The number of Ships and men._\r\n\r\nThere went this yeere by the Companies records, 11. ships and 1216.\r\npersons to be thus disposed on: Tenants for the Governors land fourescore,\r\nbesides fifty sent the former spring; for the Companies land a hundred and\r\nthirty, for the College a hundred, for the Glebe land fifty, young women\r\nto make wives ninety, servants for publike service fifty, and fifty more\r\nwhose labours were to bring up thirty of the infidels children, the rest\r\nwere sent to private Plantations.\r\n\r\n                            _Gifts given._\r\n\r\n                  _But few performe them._ {MN}\r\n\r\nTwo persons unknowne have given faire Plate and Ornaments for two\r\nCommunion Tables, the one at the College, the other at the Church of\r\nMistris Mary Robinson, who towards the foundation gave two hundred pound.\r\nAnd another unknowne person sent to the Treasurer five hundred and fifty\r\npounds, for the bringing up of the salvage children in Christianity.\r\nMaster Nicholas Farrar deceased, hath by his Will given three hundred\r\npounds to the College, to be paid when there shall be ten young Salvages\r\nplaced in it, in the meane time foure and twenty pound yeerely to bee\r\ndistributed unto three discreet and godly young men in the Colony, to\r\nbring up three wilde young infidels in some good course of life, also\r\nthere were granted eleven Pattents, {MN} upon condition to transport\r\npeople and cattle to increase the Plantations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            A.D. 1620.\r\n               _The Earle of Southampton Treasurer,\r\n                     and M.

At Mevis we\r\nintended to refresh our selves, having beene eleven weeks pestered in this\r\nunwholsome ship; but there we found two tall ships with the Hollanders\r\ncolours, but necessitie forcing us on shore, we anchored faire by them,\r\nand in friendly manner sent to hale them: {MN-2} but seeing they were\r\nSpaniards, retiring to our ship, they sent such a volley of shot after\r\nus, that shot the Boat, split the Oares, and some thorow the clothes, yet\r\nnot a man hurt; and then followed with their great Ordnance, that many\r\ntimes over-racked our ship, which being so cumbred with the Passengers\r\nprovisions, our Ordnance was not well fitted, nor any thing as it should\r\nhave beene. But perceiving what they were, we fitted our selves the best\r\nwe could to prevent a mischiefe, seeing them warp themselves to windward,\r\nwe thought it not good to be boorded on both sides at an anchor, we\r\nintended to set saile, but that the Vice-Admirall battered so hard our\r\nstar-boord side, that we fell to our businesse, and answered their\r\nunkindnesse with such faire shot from a Demiculvering, {MN-3} that shot\r\nher betweene wind and water, whereby she was glad to leave us and her\r\nAdmirall together. Comming faire by our quarter, he tooke in his Holland\r\nflag, and put forth his Spanish colours, and so haled us.\r\n\r\n                 _The manner of their fight._ {MN}\r\n\r\nWe quietly and quickly answered him, both what wee were, and whither\r\nbound, relating the effect of our Commission, and the cause of our\r\ncomming thither for water, and not to annoy any of the King of Spaines\r\nSubjects, nor any. She commanded us amaine for the King of Spaine, we\r\nreplied with inlarging the particulars what friends both the Kings our\r\nMasters were, and as we would doe no wrong, we would take none. They\r\ncommanded us aboord to shew our Commission, which we refused, but if they\r\nwould send their Boat to us willingly they should see it. {MN} But for\r\nanswer they made two great shot at us, with a volley of small shot, which\r\ncaused us to leave the decks; then with many ill words they laid us\r\naboord, which caused us to raise our maine saile, and give the word to\r\nour small shot which lay close and ready, that paid them in such sort,\r\nthey quickly retired. The fight continued halfe an houre, as if we had\r\nbeene invironed with fire and smoke, untill they discovered the waste of\r\nour ship naked, where they bravely boorded us loofe for loofe, hasting\r\nwith pikes and swords to enter, but it pleased God so to direct our\r\nCaptaine, and encourage our men with valour, that our pikes being\r\nformerly placed under our halfe deck, and certaine shot lying close for\r\nthat purpose under the Port holes, encountred them so rudely, that their\r\nfury was not onely rebated, but their hastinesse intercepted, and their\r\nwhole company beaten backe, many of our men were hurt, but I am sure they\r\nhad two for one.\r\n\r\n                      _The Captaine slaine._ {MN}\r\n\r\nIn the end they were violently repulsed, untill they [IV.129.] were\r\nreinforced to charge againe by their commands, who standing upon their\r\nhonors, thought it a great indignity to be so affronted, which caused a\r\nsecond charge, and that answered with a second beating backe: whereat the\r\nCaptaine grew inraged, and constrained them to come on againe afresh,\r\nwhich they did so effectually, that questionlesse it had wrought an\r\nalteration, if the God that tosseth Monarchies, and teareth Mountaines,\r\nhad not taught us to tosse our Pikes with prosperous events, and powred\r\nout a volley of small shot amongst them, {MN} whereby that valiant\r\nCommander was slaine, and many of his Souldiers dropped downe likewise on\r\nthe top of the hatches. This we saw with our eies, and rejoyced with it\r\nat our hearts, so that we might perceive good successe comming on, our\r\nCaptaine presently tooke advantage of their discomfiture, though with\r\nmuch comiseration of that resolute Captaine, and not onely plied them\r\nagaine with our Ordnance, but had more shot under the Pikes, which was\r\nbestowed to good purpose, and amazed our enemies with the suddennesse.\r\n\r\n                   _A worthy exploit of Lucas._\r\n\r\n                  _The event of the fight._ {MN}\r\n\r\nAmongst the rest, one Lucas, our Carpenters Mate, must not be forgotten,\r\nwho perceiving a way how to annoy them; As they were thus puzled and in a\r\nconfusion, drew out a Minion under the halfe decke, and there bent it\r\nupon them in such a manner, that when it was fired, the cases of stones\r\nand peeces of Iron fell upon them so thick, as cleared the decke, and\r\nslew many, and in short time we saw few assailants, but such as crept\r\nfrom place to place covertly from the fury of our shot, which now was\r\nthicker than theirs: for although as far as we may commend our enemies,\r\nthey had done something worthy of commendations; yet either wanting men,\r\nor being overtaken with the unlooked for valour of our men, they now\r\nbegan to shrinke, and give us leave to be wanton with our advantage. Yet\r\nwe could onely use but foure peece of Ordnances, but they served the\r\nturne as well as all the rest: for she was shot so oft betweene wind and\r\nwater, we saw they were willing to leave us, but by reason she was fast\r\nin the latch of our cable, which in haste of weighing our anchor hung\r\naloofe, she could not cleare her selfe as she wrought to doe, till one\r\ncut the Cable with an axe, and was slaine by freeing us. Having beene\r\naboord us two houres and an halfe, seeing her selfe cleere, all the shot\r\nwee had plaied on both sides, which lasted till we were out of shot, then\r\nwe discovered the Vice-Admirall comming to her assistance, who began a\r\nfarre off to ply us with their Ordnances, and put us in minde we had\r\nanother worke in hand. Whereupon we separated the dead and hurt bodies,\r\nand manned the ship with the rest, and were so well incouraged wee waifed\r\nthem a maine. The Admirall stood aloofe off, and the other would not come\r\nwithin Falcon shot, where she lay battering us till shee received another\r\npaiment from a Demiculvering, which made her beare with the shore for\r\nsmooth water to mend her leakes. The next morning they both came up\r\nagaine with us, as if they had determined to devour us at once, but it\r\nseemed it was but a bravado, though they forsooke not our quarter for a\r\ntime within Musket shot; yet all the night onely they kept us company,\r\nbut made not a shot. During which time we had leasure to provide us\r\nbetter than before: but God be thanked they made onely but a shew of\r\nanother assault, ere suddenly the Vice-admirall fell a starne, and the\r\nother lay shaking in the wind, and so they both left us. {MN} The fight\r\ncontinued six houres, and was the more unwelcome, because we were so ill\r\nprovided, and had no intent to fight, nor give occasion to disturbe them.\r\nAs for the losse of men, if Religion had not taught us what by the\r\nprovidence of God is brought to passe, yet daily experience might informe\r\nus, of the dangers of wars, and perils at sea, by stormes tempests,\r\nshipwracks, encounters with Pirats, meeting with enemies, crosse winds,\r\nlong voiages, unknowne shores, barbarous Nations, and an hundred\r\ninconveniences, of which humane pollicies are not capable, nor mens\r\nconjectures apprehensive. We lost Doctor Bohun, a worthy valiant\r\nGentleman, (a long time brought up amongst the most learned Surgeons, and\r\nPhysitions in Netherlands, and this his second journey to Virginia:) and\r\nseven slaine out right, two died shortly [IV.130.] of their wounds;\r\nsixteene was shot, whose limbs God be thanked was recovered without\r\nmaime, and now setled in Virginia: how many they lost we know not, but we\r\nsaw a great many lie on the decks, and their skuppers runne with bloud,\r\nthey were about three hundred tunnes apeece, each sixteene or twentie\r\nBrasse-peeces. Captaine Chester, who in this fight had behaved himselfe\r\nlike a most vigilant, resolute, and a couragious souldier, as also our\r\nhonest and valiant master, did still so comfort and incourage us by all\r\nthe meanes they could, at last to all our great contents we arrived in\r\nVirginia, and from thence returned safely to England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   The Names of the Adventurers for Virginia, Alphabetically set downe,\r\n     according to a printed Booke, set out by the Treasurer and Councell\r\n     in this present yeere, 1620.\r\n\r\n                              A\r\n\r\n  Sir William Aliffe.

Extracted out of the Councels Letters for Virginia.\r\n\r\n                          _A degression_\r\n\r\nFrom Virginia, by the relations of the Chieftains there, & many I have\r\nconferred with, that came from thence hither, I have much admired to\r\nheare of the incredible pleasure, profit and plenty this Plantation doth\r\nabound in, and yet could never heare of any returne but Tobacco, but it\r\nhath oft amazed me to understand how strangely the Salvages hath beene\r\ntaught the use of our armes, and imploied in hunting and fowling with our\r\nfowling peeces, and our men rooting in the ground about Tobacco like\r\nSwine; besides that, the Salvages that doe little but continually\r\nexercise their bow and arrowes, should dwell and lie so familiarly\r\namongst our men that practised little but the Spade, being so farre\r\nasunder, and in such small parties dispersed, and neither Fort, exercise\r\nof armes used, Ordnances mounted, Courts of guard, nor any preparation\r\nnor provision to prevent a forraine enemy, much more the Salvages\r\nhowsoever; for the Salvages uncertaine conformity I doe not wonder, but\r\nfor their constancy and conversion, I am and ever have beene of the\r\nopinion of Master Jonas Stockam a Minister in Virginia, who even at this\r\ntime, when all things were so prosperous, and the Salvages at the point\r\nof conversion, against all their Governours and Councels opinions, writ\r\nto the Councell and Company in England to this effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            May 28.\r\n\r\n                  _Master Stockams Relation._\r\n\r\nWe that have left our native country to sojourne in a strange land, some\r\nidle spectators, who either cowardly dare not, or covetously will not\r\nadventure either their purses or persons in so commendable a worke;\r\nothers supporting Atlas of this almost unsupportable burdens as your\r\nselves, without whose assistance this Virginia Firmament (in which some)\r\nand I hope in short time will shine many more glorious Starres, though\r\nthere be many Italiannated and Spaniolized Englishmen envies our\r\nprosperities, and by all their ignominious scandals they can devise\r\nseekes to dishearten what they can, those that are willing to further\r\nthis glorious enterprize, to such I wish according to the decree of\r\nDarius, that whosoever is an enemy to our peace, and seeketh either by\r\ngetting monipolicall patens, or by forging unjust tales to hinder our\r\nwelfare, that his house were pulled downe, and a paire of gallowes made\r\nof the wood, and he hanged on them in the place.\r\n\r\nAs for those lasie servants, who had rather stand all day idle, than\r\nworke, though but an houre in this Vineyard, and spend their substance\r\nriotously, than cast the superfluity of their wealth into your Treasury,\r\nI leave them as they are to the eternall Judge of the world. But you\r\nright worthy, that hath adventured so freely, I will not examine, if it\r\nwere for the glory of God, or your [IV.140.] desire of gaine, which it\r\nmay be you expect should flow unto you with a full tide, for the\r\nconversion of the Salvages: I wonder you use not the meanes, I confesse\r\nyou say well to have them converted by faire meanes, but they scorne to\r\nacknowledge it, as for the gifts bestowed on them they devoure them, and\r\nso they would the givers if they could, and though many have endevoured\r\nby all the meanes they could by kindnesse to convert them, they finde\r\nnothing from them but derision and ridiculous answers. We have sent boies\r\namongst them to learne their Language, but they returne worse than they\r\nwent; but I am no States-man, nor love I to meddle with any thing but my\r\nBookes, but I can finde no probability by this course to draw them to\r\ngoodnesse; and I am perswaded if Mars and Minerva goe hand in hand, they\r\nwill effect more good in an houre, then those verball Mercurians in their\r\nlives, and till their Priests and Ancients have their throats cut, there\r\nis no hope to bring them to conversion.\r\n\r\n\r\n              The government of Sir Francis Wyat.\r\n\r\n               _The arrivall of Sir Francis Wyat._\r\n\r\nAbout October arrived Sir Francis Wyat, with Master George Sands,\r\nappointed Treasurer, Master Davison Secretary, Doctor Pot the Physician,\r\nand Master Cloyburne the Surgian, but much provision was very badly\r\nconditioned, nay the Hogs would not eat that Corne they brought, which\r\nwas a great cause of their sicknesse and mortality, and whatsoever is\r\nsaid against the Virginia Corne, they finde it doth better nourish than\r\nany provision is sent thither; the Sailers still they complaine are much\r\nto blame for imbesling the provisions sent to private men, killing of\r\nSwine, and disorderly trucking; for which some order would be taken.\r\n\r\n                 _Master Gookins Plantation._ {MN}\r\n\r\nIn them nine Ships that went with Sir Francis Wyat not one Passenger\r\ndied, at his arrivall he sent Master Thorpe to Opechancanough, whom hee\r\nfound much satisfied with his comming, to confirme their leagues as he\r\nhad done his Predecessors, and so contented his people should coinhabit\r\namongst them, and hee found more motions of Religion in him than could be\r\nimagined: every man betaking himselfe to his quarter, it was ordered,\r\nthat for every head they should plant but 1000. Plants of Tobacco, and\r\nupon each plant nine leaves, which will be about 100. weight, the Corne\r\nbeing appointed but at two shillings & six pence the bushell, required\r\nsuch labour, it caused most men neglect it, and depend upon trade; where\r\nwere it rated at ten shillings the bushell, every man would indevour to\r\nhave plenty to sell to the new commers, or any that wanted, and seldome\r\nany is transported from England, but it standeth in as much, besides the\r\nhazard and other necessaries, the Ships might transport of that burden.\r\n{MN} The 22. of November arrived Master Gookin out of Ireland, with fifty\r\nmen of his owne, and thirty Passengers, exceedingly well furnished with\r\nall sorts of provision and cattle, and planted himselfe at Nupors-newes:\r\nthe Cotten trees in a yeere grew so thicke as ones arme, and so high as a\r\nman: here any thing that is planted doth prosper so well as in no place\r\nbetter. For the mortality of the people accuse not the place, for of the\r\nold Planters and the families scarce one of twenty miscarries, onely the\r\nwant of necessaries are the occasions of those diseases.

Master\r\nThomas Bargave their Preacher there deceased, gave a Librarie valued at\r\none hundred Markes: and the Inhabitants hath made a contribution of one\r\nthousand and five hundred pounds, to build a house for the entertaining\r\nof strangers. {MN} This yeere also there was much suing for Patents for\r\nPlantations, who promised to transport such great multitudes of people:\r\nthere was much disputing concerning those divisions, as though the whole\r\nland had beene too little for them: six and twentie obtained their\r\ndesires, but as yet not past six hath sent thither a man; notwithstanding\r\nmany of them would have more, and are not well contented; whom I would\r\nintreat, and all other wranglers, to peruse this saying of honest\r\nClaudius.\r\n\r\n  See'st not the world of Natures worke, the fairest well, I wot,\r\n  How it, it selfe together ties, as in a true-loves knot.\r\n  Nor seest how th' Elements ayre combin'd, maintaine one constant plea,\r\n  How midst of heaven contents the Sunne, and shore containes the sea;\r\n  And how the aire both compasseth, and carrieth still earths frame,\r\n  Yet neither pressing burdens it, nor parting leaves the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n              The observations of Master John Pory Secretarie\r\n                        of Virginia, in his travels.\r\n\r\n                  _My journey to the Easterne shore._\r\n\r\n                  _A good place to make salt in._ {MN}\r\n\r\nHaving but ten men meanly provided to plant the Secretaries land on the\r\nEasterne shore neere Acomack (Captaine Wilcocks plantation, the better to\r\nsecure and assist each other). Sir George Yearley intending to visit\r\nSmiths Iles, fell so sicke that he could not, so that he sent me with\r\nEstinien Moll a French-man, to finde a convenient place to make salt in.\r\nNot long after Namenacus the King of Pawtuxunt, came to us to seeke for\r\nThomas Salvage our Interpreter. Thus insinuating himselfe, he led us into\r\na thicket, where all sitting downe, he shewed us his naked brest; asking\r\nif we saw any deformitie upon it, we told him, No; No more, said hee, is\r\nthe inside, but as sincere and pure; therefore come freely to my Countrie\r\nand welcome: which wee promised wee would within six weekes after. Having\r\ntaken a muster of the companies tenants, {MN} I went to Smiths Iles,\r\nwhere was our Salt-house: not farre off wee found a more convenient\r\nplace, and so returned to James towne.\r\n\r\n           _The King of Pawtuxunts entertainment._ {MN}\r\n\r\nBeing furnished the second time, wee arrived at Aquohanock, and\r\nconferred with Kiptopeke their King. Passing Russels Ile and Onavcoke, we\r\narrived at Pawtuxunt: the discription of those places, you may reade in\r\nCaptaine Smiths discoveries, therefore needlesse to bee writ againe. But\r\nhere arriving at Attoughcomoco the habitation of Namenacus and Wamanato,\r\nhis brother, {MN} long wee staied not ere they came aboord us with a\r\nbrasse Kettle, as bright without as within, ful of boyled Oisters. Strict\r\norder was given none should offend us, so that the next day I went with\r\nthe two Kings a hunting, to discover what I could in their confines.\r\nWamanato brought mee first to his house, where hee shewed mee his wife\r\nand children, and many Corne-fields; and being two miles within the woods\r\na hunting, as the younger conducted [IV.142.] me forth, so the elder\r\nbrought me home, and used me as kindly as he could, after their manner.\r\nThe next day he presented me twelve Bever skinnes and a Canow, which I\r\nrequited with such things to his content, that he promised to keepe them\r\nwhilst hee lived, and burie them with him being dead. Hee much wondered\r\nat our Bible, but much more to heare it was the Law of our God, and the\r\nfirst Chapter of Genesis expounded of Adam and Eve, and simple mariage;\r\nto which he replyed, hee was like Adam in one thing, for he never had but\r\none wife at once: but he as all the rest, seemed more willing of other\r\ndiscourses they better understood. The next day the two Kings with their\r\npeople, came aboord us, but brought nothing according to promise; so that\r\nEnsigne Salvage challenged Namenacus the breach of three promises, viz.\r\nnot in giving him a Boy, nor Corne, though they had plentie, nor\r\nMoutapass a fugitive, called Robert Marcum, that had lived 5. yeeres\r\namongst those northerly nations, which hee cunningly answered by excuses.\r\nWomanato it seemes, was guiltlesse of this falshood, because hee staied\r\nalone when the rest were gone. I asked him if he desired to bee great and\r\nrich; he answered, They were things all men aspired unto: which I told\r\nhim he should be, if he would follow my counsell, so he gave me two\r\ntokens, which being returned by a messenger, should suffice to make him\r\nconfident the messenger could not abuse us.\r\n\r\n                  _The treacherie of Namanicus._ {MN}\r\n\r\nSome things being stolne from us, he tooke such order that they were\r\npresently restored, then we interchanged presents: in all things hee much\r\nadmired our discretions, and gave us a guide that hee called brother, to\r\nconduct us up the River: by the way we met with divers that stil tould us\r\nof Marcum: and though it was in October, we found the Countrie very hot,\r\nand their Corne gathered before ours at James towne. {MN} The next day we\r\nwent to Paccamaganant, and they directed us to Assacomoco, where their\r\nKing Cassatowap had an old quarrell with Ensigne Salvage, but now seeming\r\nreconciled, went with us, with another Werowance towards Mattapanient,\r\nwhere they perswaded us ashore upon the point of a thicket; but supposing\r\nit some trecherie, we returned to our boat: farre we had not gone from\r\nthe shore, but a multitude of Salvages sallied out of the wood, with all\r\nthe ill words and signes of hostilitie they could. When wee saw plainly\r\ntheir bad intent, wee set the two Werowances at libertie, that all this\r\nwhile had line in the Cabbin, as not taking any notice of their villanie,\r\nbecause we would convert them by courtesie. Leaving them as we found\r\nthem, very civill and subtill, wee returned the same way wee came, to the\r\nlaughing Kings on the Easterne shore, who told us plainly, Namanicus\r\nwould also have allured him into his Countrie, under colour of trade to\r\ncut his throat. Hee told us also Opechancanough had imployed Onianimo to\r\nkill Salvage, because he brought the trade from him to the Easterne shore,\r\nand some disgrace hee had done his sonne, and some thirteene of his people\r\nbefore one hundred of those Easterlings in rescuing Thomas Graves whom\r\nthey would have slaine, where hee and three more did challenge the\r\nthirteene Pamaunkes to fight, but they durst not, so that all those\r\nEasterlings so derided them, that they came there no more.\r\n\r\n                 _Thomas Salvages good service._\r\n\r\nThis Thomas Salvage, it is sixteene yeeres since he went to Virginia,\r\nbeing a boy, hee was left with Powhatan, for Namontacke to learne the\r\nlanguage, and as this Author affirmeth, with much honestie and good\r\nsuccesse hath served the publike without any publike recompence, yet had\r\nan arrow shot through body in their service. This laughing King at\r\nAccomack, tels us the land is not two daies journy over in the broadest\r\nplace, but in some places a man may goe in halfe a day, betwixt the Bay\r\nand the maine Ocean, where inhabit many people, so that by the\r\nnarrownesse of the Land there is not many Deere, but most abundance of\r\nFish and Fowle. Kiptope his brother rules as his Lieutenant, who seeing\r\nhis younger brother more affected by the people than himselfe, freely\r\nresigned him the moitie of his Countrie, applying himselfe onely to\r\nhusbandry and hunting, yet nothing neglected in his degree, nor is hee\r\ncarelesse of any thing concernes the state, but as a vigilant and\r\nfaithfull Counceller, as hee is an affectionated Brother, bearing the\r\ngreater burden in government, though the lesser honour,  where cleane\r\n[IV.143.] contrary they on the Westerne shore, the younger beares the\r\ncharge, and the elder the dignitie. Those are the best husbands of any\r\nSalvages we know: for they provide Corne to serve them all the yeare, yet\r\nspare; and the other not for halfe the yeare, yet want. They are the most\r\ncivill and tractable people we have met with, and by little sticks will\r\nkeepe as just an account of their promises, as by a tally. In their\r\nmariages they observe a large distance, as well in affinitie as\r\nconsanguinitie; nor doe they use that devillish custome in making black\r\nBoyes. There may be on this shore about two thousand people: they on the\r\nWest would invade them, but that they want Boats to crosse the Bay, and\r\nso would divers other Nations, were they not protected by us. A few of the\r\nWesterly Runnagados had conspired against the laughing King, but fearing\r\ntheir treason was discovered, fled to Smiths Iles, where they made a\r\nmassacre of Deere and Hogges; and thence to Rickahake, betwixt Cissapeack\r\nand Nansamund, where they now are seated under the command of Itoyatin,\r\nand so I returned to James Towne, where I found the government rendred to\r\nSir Francis Wyat. In February also he travelled to the South River\r\nChawonock, some sixtie miles over land, which he found to be a very\r\nfruitfull and pleasant Country, yeelding two harvests in a yeare, and\r\nfound much of the Silke grasse formerly spoken of, was kindly used by the\r\npeople, and so returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Captaine Each sent to build a Fort to secure\r\n                              the Countrey.\r\n\r\n                             A.D. 1622.\r\n                  _The Earl of Southampton Treasurer,\r\n                       and Nicolas Farrar Deputy._\r\n\r\n       _Five and twentie sent only to build Barks and boats._ {MN}\r\n\r\nIt was no small content to all the Adventurers to heare of the safe\r\narivall of all those ships and companies, which was thought sufficient to\r\nhave made a Plantation of themselves: and againe to second them, was sent\r\nCaptaine Each in the Abigale, a ship of three or foure hundred tunnes,\r\nwho hath undertaken to make a Blockhouse amongst the Oyster banks, that\r\nshall secure the River. The furnishing him with Instruments, cost three\r\nhundred pounds; but the whole charge and the ships returne, will be neere\r\ntwo thousand pounds. {MN} In her went Captaine Barwicke with five and\r\ntwentie men for the building ships and Boats, and not other waies to be\r\nimploied: and also a selected number to build the East Indie Schoole, but\r\nas yet from Virginia little returnes but private mens Tobacco, and faire\r\npromises of plentie of Iron, Silke, Wine, and many other good and rich\r\ncommodities, besides the speedy conversion of the Salvages, that at first\r\nwere much discouraged from living amongst them, when they were debarred\r\nthe use of their peeces; therefore it was disputed as a matter of State,\r\nwhether such as would live amongst them should use them or not, as a bait\r\nto allure them; or at least such as should bee called to the knowledge of\r\nChrist. But because it was a great trouble for all causes to be brought\r\nto James Towne for a triall, Courts were appointed in convenient places\r\nto releeve them: but as they can make no Lawes in Virginia till they be\r\nratified here; so they thinke it but reason, none should bee inacted here\r\nwithout their consents, because they onely feele them, and must live under\r\nthem. Still they complaine for want of Corne, but what must be had by\r\nTrade, and how unwilling any Officer when he leaveth his place, is to make\r\ngood his number of men to his Successor, but many of them during their\r\ntimes to help themselves, undoes the Company: for the servants you allow\r\nthem, or such as they hire, they plant on their private Lands, not upon\r\nthat belongeth to their office, which crop alwaies exceeds yours, besides\r\nthose which are your tenants to halfes, are forced to row them up and\r\ndowne, whereby both you and they lose more then halfe. Nor are those\r\nofficers the ablest or best deserving, but make their experience upon the\r\ncompanies cost, and your land lies unmanured to any purpose, and will\r\nyeeld as little profit to your next new officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n           The massacre upon the two and twentieth [IV.144.]\r\n                                of March.\r\n\r\n               _The death of Nemattanow writ by M. Wimp._\r\n\r\nThe Prologue to this Tragedy, is supposed was occasioned by Nemattanow,\r\notherwise called Jack Nemattanow of the Feather, because hee commonly was\r\nmost strangely adorned with them; and for his courage and policy, was\r\naccounted amongst the Salvages their chiefe Captaine, and immortall from\r\nany hurt could bee done him by the English. This Captaine comming to one\r\nMorgans house, knowing he had many commodities that hee desired, perswaded\r\nMorgan to goe with him to Pamaunke to trucke, but the Salvage murdered him\r\nby the way; and after two or three daies returned againe to Morgans house,\r\nwhere he found two youths his Servants, who asked for their Master: Jack\r\nreplied directly he was dead; the Boyes suspecting as it was, by seeing\r\nhim weare his Cap, would have had him to Master Thorp: But Jack so moved\r\ntheir patience, they shot him, so he fell to the ground, put him in a Boat\r\nto have him before the Governor, then seven or eight miles from them. But\r\nby the way Jack finding the pangs of death upon him, desired of the Boyes\r\ntwo things; the one was, that they would not make it knowne hee was slaine\r\nwith a bullet; the other, to bury him amongst the English. At the losse of\r\nthis Salvage Opechankanough much grieved and repined, with great threats\r\nof revenge; but the English returned him such terrible answers, that he\r\ncunningly dissembled his intent, with the greatest signes he could of love\r\nand peace, yet within foureteene daies after he acted what followeth.\r\n\r\n                     _Security a bad guard._\r\n\r\nSir Francis Wyat at his arrivall was advertised, he found the Countrey\r\nsetled in such a firme peace, as most men there thought sure and\r\nunviolable, not onely in regard of their promises, but of a necessitie.\r\nThe poore weake Salvages being every way bettered by us, and safely\r\nsheltred and defended, whereby wee might freely follow our businesse: and\r\nsuch was the conceit of this conceited peace, as that there was seldome or\r\nnever a sword, and seldomer a peece, except for a Deere or Fowle, by which\r\nassurances the most plantations were placed straglingly and scatteringly,\r\nas a choice veine of rich ground invited them, and further from neighbours\r\nthe better. Their houses generally open to the Salvages, who were alwaies\r\nfriendly fed at their tables, and lodged in their bed-chambers, which made\r\nthe way plaine to effect their intents, and the conversion of the Salvages\r\nas they supposed.\r\n\r\n                   _The manner of the massacre._ {MN}\r\n\r\nHaving occasion to send to Opechankanough about the middle of March, hee\r\nused the Messenger well, and told him he held the peace so firme, the sky\r\nshould fall or he dissolved it; yet such was the treachery of those\r\npeople, when they had contrived our destruction, even but two daies before\r\nthe massacre, they guided our men with much kindnesse thorow the woods,\r\nand one Browne that lived among them to learne the language, they sent\r\nhome to his Master; yea, they borrowed our Boats to transport themselves\r\nover the River, to consult on the devillish murder that insued, and of our\r\nutter extirpation, which God of his mercy (by the meanes of one of\r\nthemselves converted to Christianitie) prevented, and as well on the\r\nFriday morning that fatall day, being the two and twentieth of March, {MN}\r\nas also in the evening before, as at other times they came unarmed into\r\nour houses, with Deere, Turkies, Fish, Fruits, and other provisions to\r\nsell us, yea in some places sat downe at breakfast with our people, whom\r\nimmediatly with their owne tooles they slew most barbarously, not sparing\r\neither age or sex, man woman or childe, so sudden in their execution, that\r\nfew or none discerned the weapon or blow that brought them to destruction:\r\nIn which manner also they slew many of our people at severall works in the\r\nfields, well knowing in what places and quarters each of our men were, in\r\nregard of their familiaritie with us, for the effecting that great\r\nmaster-peece of worke their conversion; and by this meanes fell that\r\nfatall morning under the bloudy and barbarous hands of that perfidious and\r\ninhumane people, [IV.145.] three hundred forty seven men, women and\r\nchildren, most by their owne weapons, and not being content with their\r\nlives, they fell againe upon the dead bodies, making as well as they could\r\na fresh murder, defacing, dragging, and mangling their dead carkases into\r\nmany peeces, and carying some parts away in derision, with base and\r\nbrutish triumph.\r\n\r\n                         _Their cruelty._\r\n\r\nNeither yet did these beasts spare those amongst the rest well knowne unto\r\nthem, from whom they had daily received many benefits, but spightfully\r\nalso massacred them without any remorse or pitie; being in this more fell\r\nthen Lions and Dragons, as Histories record, which have preserved their\r\nBenefactors; such is the force of good deeds, though done to cruell\r\nbeasts, to take humanitie upon them, but these miscreants put on a more\r\nunnaturall brutishnesse then beasts, as by those instances may appeare.\r\n\r\n                   _The murder of Master Thorp._\r\n\r\nThat worthy religious Gentleman M. George Thorp, Deputie to the College\r\nlands, sometimes one of his Majesties Pensioners, & in command one of the\r\nprincipall in Virginia; did so truly affect their conversion, that\r\nwhosoever under him did them the least displeasure, were punished\r\nseverely. He thought nothing too deare for them, he never denied them any\r\nthing, in so much that when they complained that our Mastives did feare\r\nthem, he to content them in all things, caused some of them to be killed\r\nin their presence, to the great displeasure of the owners, and would have\r\nhad all the rest guelt to make them the milder, might he have had his\r\nwill. The King dwelling but in a Cottage, he built him a faire house after\r\nthe English fashion, in which he tooke such pleasure, especially in the\r\nlocke and key, which he so admired, as locking and unlocking his doore a\r\nhundred times a day, he thought no device in the world comparable to it.\r\n\r\n              _The slaughter of Captaine Powell._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                     _A Salvage slaine._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\n                    _M. Baldwins escape._ {MN-3}\r\n\r\n              _M. Thomas Hamer with 22 escapeth._ {MN-4}\r\n\r\nThus insinuating himselfe into this Kings favour for his religious\r\npurpose, he conferred oft with him about Religion, as many other in this\r\nformer Discourse had done, and this Pagan confessed to him as he did to\r\nthem, our God was better then theirs, and seemed to be much pleased with\r\nthat Discourse, and of his company, and to requite all those courtesies;\r\nyet this viperous brood did, as the sequell shewed, not onely murder him,\r\nbut with such spight and scorne abused his dead corps as is unfitting\r\nto be heard with civill eares. One thing I cannot omit, that when this\r\ngood Gentleman upon his fatall houre, was warned by his man, who\r\nperceiving some treachery intended by those hell-hounds, to looke to\r\nhimselfe, and withall ran away for feare he should be apprehended, and\r\nso saved his owne life; yet his Master out of his good meaning was so\r\nvoid of suspition and full of confidence, they had slaine him, or he\r\ncould or would beleeve they would hurt him. {MN-1} Captaine Nathaniel\r\nPowell one of the first Planters, a valiant Souldier, and not any in the\r\nCountrey better knowne amongst them; yet such was the error of an\r\nover-conceited power and prosperitie, and their simplicities, they not\r\nonely slew him and his family, but butcher-like hagled their bodies, and\r\ncut off his head, to expresse their uttermost height of cruelty. {MN-2}\r\nAnother of the old company of Captaine Smith, called Nathaniel Causie,\r\nbeing cruelly wounded, and the Salvages about him, with an axe did cleave\r\none of their heads, whereby the rest fled and he escaped: for they hurt\r\nnot any that did either fight or stand upon their guard. In one place\r\nwhere there was but two men that had warning of it, they defended the\r\nhouse against 60. or more that assaulted it. {MN-3} M. Baldwin at\r\nWarraskoyack, his wife being so wounded, she lay for dead, yet by his oft\r\ndischarging of his peece, saved her, his house, himselfe, & divers others.\r\nAt the same time they came to one Master Harisons house, neere halfe a\r\nmile from Baldwines, {MN-4} where was Master Thomas Hamer with six men,\r\nand eighteene or nineteene women and children. Here the Salvages with many\r\npresents and faire perswasions, fained they came for Capt. Ralfe Hamer to\r\ngo to their King, then hunting in the woods, presently they sent to him,\r\nbut he not comming as they expected, set fire of a Tobacco-house, and then\r\ncame to tell them in the dwelling house of it to quench it; all the men\r\nran towards it, but Master Hamer not suspecting any thing, whom the\r\nSalvages pursued, [IV.146.] shot them full of arrowes, then beat out their\r\nbraines. Hamer having finished a letter hee was a writing, followed after\r\nto see what was the matter, but quickly they shot an arrow in his back,\r\nwhich caused him returne and barricado up the doores, whereupon the\r\nSalvages set fire on the house. Harisons Boy finding his Masters peece\r\nloaded, discharged it at randome, at which bare report the Salvages all\r\nfled, Baldwin still discharging his peece, and Mr. Hamer with two and\r\ntwentie persons thereby got to his house, leaving their owne burning. In\r\nlike manner, they had fired Lieutenant Basse his house, with all the rest\r\nthere about, slaine the people, and so left that Plantation.\r\n\r\n               _Captaine Ralfe Hamer with forty escapeth._\r\n\r\nCaptaine Hamer all this while not knowing any thing, comming to his\r\nBrother that had sent for him to go hunt with the King, meeting the\r\nSalvages chasing some, yet escaped, retired to his new house then a\r\nbuilding, from whence he came; there onely with spades, axes, and\r\nbrickbats, he defended himselfe and his Company till the Salvages\r\ndeparted. Not long after, the Master from the ship had sent six\r\nMusketiers, with which he recovered their Merchants store-house, where he\r\narmed ten more, and so with thirtie more unarmed workmen, found his\r\nBrother and the rest at Baldwins: Now seeing all they had was burnt and\r\nconsumed, they repaired to James Towne with their best expedition; yet not\r\nfar from Martins hundred, where seventy three were slaine, was a little\r\nhouse and a small family, that heard not of any of this till two daies\r\nafter.\r\n\r\n           _The Salvages attempt to surprise a ship._ {MN}\r\n\r\nAll those, and many others whom they have as maliciously murdered, sought\r\nthe good of those poore brutes, that thus despising Gods mercies, must\r\nneeds now as miscreants be corrected by Justice: to which leaving them, I\r\nwill knit together the thred of this discourse. {MN} At the time of the\r\nmassacre, there were three or foure ships in James River, and one in the\r\nnext, and daily more to come in, as there did within foureteene daies\r\nafter, one of which they indevoured to have surprised: yet were the\r\nhearts of the English ever stupid, and averted from beleeving any thing\r\nmight weaken their hopes, to win them by kinde usage to Christianitie. But\r\ndivers write from thence, that Almighty God hath his great worke in this\r\nTragedy, and will thereout draw honor and glory to his name, and a more\r\nflourishing estate and safetie to themselves, and with more speed to\r\nconvert the Salvage children to himselfe, since he so miraculously hath\r\npreserved the English; there being yet, God be praised, eleven parts of\r\ntwelve remaining, whose carelesse neglect of their owne safeties, seemes\r\nto have beene the greatest cause of their destructions: yet you see, God\r\nby a converted Salvage that disclosed the plot, saved the rest, and the\r\nPinnace then in Pamaunkes River, whereof (say they) though our sinnes made\r\nus unworthy of so glorious a conversion, yet his infinite wisdome can\r\nneverthelesse bring it to passe, and in good time, by such meanes as we\r\nthinke most unlikely: for in the delivery of them that survive, no mans\r\nparticular carefulnesse saved one person, but the meere goodnesse of God\r\nhimselfe, freely and miraculously preserving whom he pleased.\r\n\r\nThe Letters of Master George Sands, a worthy Gentleman, and many others\r\nbesides them returned, brought us this unwelcome newes, that hath beene\r\nheard at large in publike Court, that the Indians and they lived as one\r\nNation, yet by a generall combination in one day plotted to subvert the\r\nwhole Colony, and at one instant, though our severall Plantations were one\r\nhundred and fortie miles up on River on both sides.\r\n\r\nBut for the better understanding of all things, you must remember these\r\nwilde naked natives live not in great numbers together, but dispersed,\r\ncommonly in thirtie, fortie, fiftie, or sixtie in a company. Some places\r\nhave two hundred, few places more, but many lesse; yet they had all\r\nwarning given them one from another in all their habitations, though\r\nfarre asunder, to meet at the day and houre appointed for our destruction\r\nat al our several Plantations; some directed to one place, some to\r\nanother, all to be done at the time appointed, which they did accordingly:\r\nSome entring their houses under colour of trading, so tooke their\r\nadvantage; others drawing us [IV.147.] abroad under faire pretences, and\r\nthe rest suddenly falling upon those that were at their labours.\r\n\r\n                   _Six of the Councell slaine._\r\n\r\nSix of the counsell suffered under this treason, and the slaughter had\r\nbeene universall, if God had not put it into the heart of an Indian, who\r\nlying in the house of one Pace, was urged by another Indian his Brother,\r\nthat lay with him the night before to kill Pace, as he should doe Perry\r\nwhich was his friend, being so commanded from their King; telling him also\r\nhow the next day the execution should be finished: Perrys Indian presently\r\narose and reveales it to Pace, that used him as his sonne; and thus them\r\nthat escaped was saved by this one converted Infidell. And though three\r\nhundred fortie seven were slaine, yet thousands of ours were by the\r\nmeanes of this alone thus preserved, for which Gods name be praised for\r\never and ever.\r\n\r\n                      _How it was revealed._\r\n\r\nPace upon this, securing his house, before day rowed to James Towne, and\r\ntold the Governor of it, whereby they were prevented, and at such other\r\nPlantations as possibly intelligence could be given: and where they saw us\r\nupon our guard, at the sight of a peece they ranne away; but the rest were\r\nmost slaine, their houses burnt, such Armes and Munition as they found\r\nthey tooke away, and some cattell also they destroied. Since wee finde\r\nOpechankanough the last yeare had practised with a King on the Easterne\r\nshore, to furnish him with a kind of poison, which onely growes in his\r\nCountry to poison us. But of this bloudy acte never griefe and shame\r\npossessed any people more then themselves, to be thus butchered by so\r\nnaked and cowardly a people, who dare not stand the presenting of a staffe\r\nin manner of a peece, nor an uncharged peece in the hands of a woman.\r\n(But I must tell those Authors, though some might be thus cowardly, there\r\nwere many of them had better spirits.)\r\n\r\n                          _Memorandums._\r\n\r\n                        _Captaine Smith._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThus have you heard the particulars of this massacre, which in those\r\nrespects some say will be good for the Plantation, because now we have\r\njust cause to destroy them by all meanes possible: but I thinke it had\r\nbeene much better it had never happened; for they have given us an hundred\r\ntimes as just occasions long agoe to subject them, (and I wonder I can\r\nheare of none but Master Stockam and Master Whitaker of my opinion.)\r\nMoreover, where before we were troubled in cleering the ground of great\r\nTimber, which was to them of small use: now we may take their owne plaine\r\nfields and Habitations, which are the pleasantest places in the Countrey.\r\nBesides, the Deere, Turkies, and other Beasts and Fowles will exceedingly\r\nincrease if we beat the Salvages out of the Countrey, for at all times of\r\nthe yeare they never spare Male nor Female, old nor young, egges nor\r\nbirds, fat nor leane, in season or out of season with them, all is one.\r\nThe like they did in our Swine and Goats, for they have used to kill eight\r\nin tenne more then we, or else the wood would most plentifully abound with\r\nvictuall; besides it is more easie to civilize them by conquest then faire\r\nmeanes; for the one may be made at once, but their civilizing will require\r\na long time and much industry. The manner how to suppresse them is so\r\noften related and approved, I omit it here: And you have twenty examples\r\nof the Spaniards how they got the West-Indies, and forced the treacherous\r\nand rebellious Infidels to doe all manner of drudgery worke and slavery\r\nfor them, themselves living like Souldiers upon the fruits of their\r\nlabours. {MN} This will make us more circumspect, and be an example to\r\nposteritie: (But I say, this might as well have beene put in practise\r\nsixteene yeares agoe as now.)\r\n\r\n                 _His Majesties gift._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n              _London sets out 100. persons._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nThus upon this Anvill shall wee now beat our selves an Armour of proofe\r\nhereafter to defend us against such incursions, and ever hereafter make us\r\nmore circumspect: {MN-1} but to helpe to repaire this losse, besides his\r\nMajesties bounty in Armes, he gave the Company out of the Tower, and\r\ndivers other Honorable persons have renewed their adventures, we must not\r\nomit the Honorable Citie of London, {MN-2} to whose endlesse praise wee\r\nmay speake it, are now setting forward one hundred persons, and divers\r\nothers at their owne costs are a repairing, and all good [IV.148.] men doe\r\nthinke never the worse of the businesse for all these disasters.\r\n\r\n           _A lamentable example, too oft approved._ {MN}\r\n\r\nWhat growing state was there ever in the world which had not the like?\r\nRome grew by oppression, and rose upon the backe of her enemies: and the\r\nSpaniards have had many of those counterbuffes, more than we. Columbus,\r\nupon his returne from the West-Indies into Spaine, having left his people\r\nwith the Indies, in peace and promise of good usage amongst them, at his\r\nreturne backe found not one of them living, but all treacherously slaine\r\nby the Salvages. After this againe, when the Spanish Colonies were\r\nincreased to great numbers, {MN} the Indians from whom the Spaniards for\r\ntrucking stuffe used to have all their corne, generally conspired together\r\nto plant no more at all, intending thereby to famish them; themselves\r\nliving in the meane time upon Cassava, a root to make bread, onely then\r\nknowne to themselves. This plot of theirs by the Spaniards oversight,\r\nthat foolishly depended upon strangers for their bread, tooke such effect,\r\nand brought them to such misery by the rage of famine, that they spared no\r\nuncleane nor loathsome beast, no not the poisonous and hideous Serpents,\r\nbut eat them up also, devouring one death to save them from another; and\r\nby this meanes their whole Colony well-neere surfeted, sickned and died\r\nmiserably, and when they had againe recovered this losse, by their\r\nincontinency an infinite number of them died on the Indian disease, we\r\ncall the French Pox, which at first being a strange and an unknowne\r\nmalady, was deadly upon whomsoever it lighted: then had they a little\r\nflea called Nigua, which got betweene the skinne and the flesh before they\r\nwere aware, and there bred and multiplied, making swellings and\r\nputrifactions, to the decay and losse of many of their bodily members.\r\n\r\n                   _Note this conclusion._ {MN}\r\n\r\nAgaine, divers times they were neere undone by their ambition, faction,\r\nand malice of the Commanders. Columbus, to whom they were also much\r\nbeholden, was sent with his Brother in chaines into Spaine; and some other\r\ngreat Commanders killed and murdered one another. Pizzaro was killed by\r\nAlmagros sonne, and him Vasco beheaded, which Vasco was taken by Blasco,\r\nand Blasco was likewise taken by Pizzaros Brother: And thus by their\r\ncovetous and spightfull quarrels, they were ever shaking the maine pillars\r\nof their Common-weale. These and many more mischiefes and calamities\r\nhapned them, more then ever did to us, and at one time being even at the\r\nlast gaspe, had two ships not arrived with supplies as they did, they were\r\nso disheartned, they were a leaving the Countrey: yet we see for all those\r\nmiseries they have attained to their ends at last, as is manifest to all\r\nthe world, both with honour, power, and wealth: and whereas before few\r\ncould be hired to goe to inhabit there, now with great sute they must\r\nobtaine it; {MN} but where there was no honesty, nor equity, nor\r\nsanctitie, nor veritie, nor pietie, nor good civilitie in such a Countrey,\r\ncertainly there can bee no stabilitie.\r\n\r\n     _How the Spaniards raise their wealth in the West Indies._ {MN}\r\n\r\nTherefore let us not be discouraged, but rather animated by those\r\nconclusions, seeing we are so well assured of the goodnesse and\r\ncommodities may bee had in Virginia, nor is it to be much doubted there is\r\nany want of Mines of most sorts, no not of the richest, as is well knowne\r\nto some yet living that can make it manifest when time shall serve: and\r\nyet to thinke that gold and silver Mines are in a country otherwise most\r\nrich and fruitfull, or the greatest wealth in a Plantation, is but a\r\npopular error, as is that opinion likewise, that the gold and silver is\r\nnow the greatest wealth of the West Indies at this present. {MN} True it\r\nis indeed, that in the first conquest the Spaniards got great and mighty\r\nstore of treasure from the Natives, which they in long space had heaped\r\ntogether, and in those times the Indians shewed them entire and rich\r\nMines, which now by the relations of them that have beene there, are\r\nexceedingly wasted, so that now the charge of getting those Metals is\r\ngrowne excessive, besides the consuming the lives of many by their\r\npestilent smoke and vapours in digging and refining them, so that all\r\nthings considered, the cleere gaines of those metals, the Kings part\r\ndefraied, to the Adventurers is but small, and nothing neere so much as\r\nvulgarly is imagined; and were it not for other rich Commodities there\r\nthat inrich [IV.149.] them, those of the Contraction house were never able\r\nto subsist by the Mines onely; for the greatest part of their Commodities\r\nare partly naturall, and partly transported from other parts of the world,\r\nand planted in the West-Indies, as in their mighty wealth of Sugarcanes,\r\nbeing first transported from the Canaries; and in Ginger and other things\r\nbrought out of the East-Indies, in their Cochanele, Indicos, Cotton, and\r\ntheir infinite store of Hides, Quick-silver, Allum, Woad, Brasill woods,\r\nDies, Paints, Tobacco, Gums, Balmes, Giles, Medicinals and Perfumes,\r\nSassaparilla and many other physicall drugs: These are the meanes whereby\r\nthey raise that mighty charge of drawing out their gold and silver to the\r\ngreat & cleare revenue of their King. Now seeing the most of those\r\ncommodities, or as usefull, may be had in Virginia by the same meanes, as\r\nI have formerly said; let us with all speed take the priority of time,\r\nwhere also may be had the priority of place, in chusing the best seats of\r\nthe Country, which now by vanquishing the salvages, is like to offer a\r\nmore faire and ample choice of fruitfull habitations, then hitherto our\r\ngentlenesse and faire comportments could attaine unto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               A.D. 1622.\r\n\r\n             The numbers that were slaine in those severall\r\n                         Plantations.\r\n\r\n  1  At Captaine Berkleys Plantation, himselfe and 21. others,\r\n      seated at the Falling-Crick, 66. miles from James City.      22\r\n  2  Master Thomas Sheffelds Plantation, some three miles from\r\n      the Falling-Crick, himselfe and 12. others.                  13\r\n  3  At Henrico Iland, about two miles from Sheffelds Plantation.   6\r\n  4  Slaine of the College people, twenty miles from Henrico.      17\r\n  5  At Charles City, and of Captaine Smiths men.                   5\r\n  6  At the next adjoyning Plantation.                              8\r\n  7  At William Farrars house.                                     10\r\n  8  At Brickley hundred, fifty miles from Charles City, Master\r\n      Thorp and                                                    10\r\n  9  At Westover, a mile from Brickley.                             2\r\n 10  At Master John Wests Plantation.                               2\r\n 11  At Captaine Nathaniel Wests Plantation.                        2\r\n 12  At Lieutenant Gibs his Plantation.                            12\r\n 13  At Richard Owens house, himselfe and                           6\r\n 14  At Master Owen Macars house, himselfe and                      3\r\n 15  At Martins hundred, seven miles from James City               73\r\n 16  At another place.                                              7\r\n 17  At Edward Bonits Plantation.                                  50\r\n 18  At Master Waters his house, himselfe and                       4\r\n 19  At Apamatucks River, at Master Perce his Plantation, five\r\n      miles from the College.                                       4\r\n 20  At Master Macocks Divident, Captaine Samuel Macock, and        4\r\n 21  At Flowerda hundred, Sir George Yearleys Plantation.           6\r\n 22  On the other side opposite to it.                              7\r\n 23  At Master Swinhows house, himselfe and                         7\r\n 24  At Master William Bickars house, himselfe and                  4\r\n 25  At Weanock, of Sir George Yearleys people.                    21\r\n 26  At Powel Brooke, Captaine Nathaniel Powel, and                12\r\n 27  At South-hampton hundred.                                      5\r\n 28  At Martin Brandons hundred.                                    7\r\n 29  At Captaine Henry Spilmans house.                              2\r\n 30  At Ensigne Spences house.                                      5\r\n 31  At Master Thomas Perse his house by Mulbery Ile, himselfe and  4\r\n\r\n                     The whole number 347.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Men in this taking bettered with affliction, [IV.150.]\r\n    Better attend, and mind, and marke Religion,\r\n    For then true voyces issue from their hearts,\r\n    Then speake they what they thinke in inmost parts,\r\n    The truth remaines, they cast off fained Arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n        _How they were reduced to five or six places._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n             _Gookins and Jordens resolutions._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\n              _The opinion of Captaine Smith._ {MN-3}\r\n\r\nThis lamentable and so unexpected a disaster caused them all beleeve the\r\nopinion of Master Stockam, and drave them all to their wits end: it was\r\ntwenty or thirty daies ere they could resolve what to doe, {MN-1} but at\r\nlast it was concluded, all the petty Plantations should be abandoned, and\r\ndrawne onely to make good five or six places, where all their labours now\r\nfor the most part must redound to the Lords of those Lands where they were\r\nresident. Now for want of Boats, it was impossible upon such a sudden to\r\nbring also their cattle, and many other things, which with much time,\r\ncharge and labour they had then in possession with them; all which for the\r\nmost part at their departure was burnt, ruined and destroyed by the\r\nSalvages. {MN-2} Only Master Gookins at Nuports-newes would not obey the\r\nCommanders command in that, though hee had scarce five and thirty of all\r\nsorts with him, yet he thought himselfe sufficient against what could\r\nhappen, and so did to his great credit and the content of his Adventurers.\r\nMaster Samuel Jorden gathered together but a few of the straglers about\r\nhim at Beggers-bush, where he fortified and lived in despight of the\r\nenemy. Nay, Mistresse Proctor, a proper, civill, modest Gentlewoman did\r\nthe like, till perforce the English Officers forced her and all them with\r\nher to goe with them, or they would fire her house themselves, as the\r\nSalvages did when they were gone, in whose despight they had kept it, and\r\nwhat they had a moneth or three weekes after the Massacre; which was to\r\ntheir hearts a griefe beyond comparison, to lose all they had in that\r\nmanner, onely to secure others pleasures. {MN-3} Now here in England it\r\nwas thought, all those remainders might presently have beene reduced into\r\nfifties or hundreds in places most convenient with what they had, having\r\nsuch strong houses as they reported they had, which with small labour\r\nmight have beene made invincible Castles against all the Salvages in the\r\nLand, and then presently raised a company, as a running Armie to torment\r\nthe Barbarous and secure the rest, and so have had all that Country\r\nbetwixt the Rivers of Powhatan and Pamaunke to range and sustaine them;\r\nespecially all the territories of Kecourrhtan, Chiskact and Paspahege,\r\nfrom Ozenies to that branch of Pamaunke, comming from Youghtanund, which\r\nstrait of land is not past 4. or 5. miles, to have made a peninsula much\r\nbigger then the Summer Iles, invironed with the broadest parts of those\r\ntwo maine Rivers, which for plenty of such things as Virginia affords is\r\nnot to be exceeded, and were it well manured, more then sufficient for ten\r\nthousand men. This, were it well understood, cannot but be thought better\r\nthen to bring five or six hundred to lodge and live on that, which before\r\nwould not well receive and maintaine a hundred, planting little or\r\nnothing, but spend that they have upon hopes out of England, one evill\r\nbegetting another, till the disease is past cure: Therefore it is\r\nimpossible but such courses must produce most fearefull miseries and\r\nextreme extremities; if it prove otherwise, I should be exceeding glad. I\r\nconfesse I am somewhat too bold to censure other mens actions being not\r\npresent, but they have done as much of me; yea many here in England that\r\nwere never there, & also many there that knowes little more then their\r\nPlantations, but as they are informed; and this doth touch the glory of\r\nGod, the honour of my Country, and the publike good so much, for which\r\nthere hath beene so many faire pretences, that I hope none will be angry\r\nfor speaking my opinion, seeing the old Proverbe doth allow losers leave\r\nto speake; and Du Bartas saith,\r\n\r\n    Even as the wind the angry Ocean moves,\r\n    Wave hunteth Wave, and Billow Billow shoves,\r\n    So doe all Nations justell each the other, [IV.151.]\r\n    And so one people doe pursue another,\r\n    And scarce a second hath the first unhoused,\r\n    Before a third him thence againe have roused.\r\n\r\n\r\n              _The providence of Captaine Nuse._\r\n\r\nAmongst the multitude of these severall Relations, it appeares Captaine\r\nNuse seeing many of the difficulties to ensue, caused as much Corne to be\r\nplanted as he could at Elizabeths city, & though some destroyed that they\r\nhad set, fearing it would serve the Salvages for Ambuscadoes, trusting to\r\nreleefe by trade, or from England, which hath ever beene one cause of our\r\nmiseries, for from England wee have not had much, and for trading, every\r\none hath not Ships, Shalops, Interpreters, men and provisions to performe\r\nit, and those that have, use them onely for their owne private gaine, not\r\nthe publike good, so that our beginning this yeere doth cause many to\r\ndistrust the event of the next. Here wee will leave Captaine Nuse for a\r\nwhile, lamenting the death of Captaine Norton, a valiant industrious\r\nGentleman, adorned with many good qualities, besides Physicke and\r\nChirurgery, which for the publike good he freely imparted to all gratis,\r\nbut most bountifully to the poore; and let us speake a little of Captaine\r\nCroshaw amongst the midst of those broiles in the River of Patawomeke.\r\n\r\n               _Captaine Croshaw his voyage to Patawomeke._\r\n\r\nBeing in a small Barke called the Elizabeth, under the command of Captaine\r\nSpilman, at Cekacawone, a Salvage stole aboord them, and told them of the\r\nMassacre, and that Opechancanough had plotted with his King and Country to\r\nbetray them also, which they refused, but them of Wighcocomoco at the\r\nmouth of the river had undertaken it; upon this Spilman went thither, but\r\nthe Salvages seeing his men so vigilant and well armed, they suspected\r\nthemselves discovered, and to colour their guilt, the better to delude\r\nhim, so contented his desire in trade, his Pinnace was neere fraught; but\r\nseeing no more to be had, Croshaw went to Patawomek, where he intended to\r\nstay and trade for himselfe, by reason of the long acquaintance he had\r\nwith this King that so earnestly entreated him now to be his friend, his\r\ncountenancer, his Captaine and director against the Pazaticans, the\r\nNacotchtanks, and Moyaons his mortall enemies. Of this oportunity Croshaw\r\nwas glad, as well to satisfie his owne desire in some other purpose he\r\nhad, as to keepe the King as an opposite to Opechancanough, and adhere him\r\nunto us, or at least make him an instrument against our enemies; so onely\r\nElis Hill stayed with him, and the Pinnace returned to Elizabeths City;\r\nhere shall they rest also a little, till we see how this newes was\r\nentertained in England.\r\n\r\n                  _The arrivall of this newes in England._\r\n\r\nIt was no small griefe to the Councell and Company, to understand of such\r\na supposed impossible losse, as that so many should fall by the hands of\r\nmen so contemptible; and yet having such warnings, especially by the death\r\nof Nemattanow, whom the Salvages did thinke was shot-free, as he had\r\nperswaded them, having so long escaped so many dangers without any hurt.\r\nBut now to leape out of this labyrinth of melancholy, all this did not so\r\ndiscourage the noble adventurers, nor divers others still to undertake new\r\nseverall Plantations, but that divers ships were dispatched away, for\r\ntheir supplies and assistance thought sufficient. Yet Captaine Smith did\r\nintreat and move them to put in practise his old offer, seeing now it was\r\ntime to use both it and him, how slenderly heretofore both had beene\r\nregarded, and because it is not impertinent to the businesse, it is not\r\nmuch amisse to remember what it was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            A.D. 1622.\r\n\r\n    The project and offer of Captaine John Smith, to [IV.152.]\r\n       the Right Honourable, and Right Worshipfull\r\n       Company of Virginia.\r\n\r\n              _Captaine Smiths offer to the Company._\r\n\r\nIf you please I may be transported with a hundred Souldiers and thirty\r\nSailers by the next Michaelmas, with victuall, munition, and such\r\nnecessary provision, by Gods assistance, we would endevour to inforce the\r\nSalvages to leave their Country, or bring them in that feare and\r\nsubjection that every man should follow their businesse securely, whereas\r\nnow halfe their times and labours are spent in watching and warding, onely\r\nto defend, but altogether unable to suppresse the Salvages, because every\r\nman now being for himselfe will be unwilling to be drawne from their\r\nparticular labours, to be made as pack-horses for all the rest, without\r\nany certainty of some better reward and preferment then I can understand\r\nany there can or will yet give them.\r\n\r\nThese I would imploy onely in ranging the Countries, and tormenting the\r\nSalvages, and that they should be as a running Army till this were\r\neffected, and then settle themselves in some such convenient place, that\r\nshould ever remaine a garison of that strength, ready upon any occasion\r\nagainst the Salvages, or any other for the defence of the Countrey, and to\r\nsee all the English well armed, and instruct them their use. But I would\r\nhave a Barke of one hundred tunnes, and meanes to build sixe or seven\r\nShalops, to transport them where there should bee occasion.\r\n\r\nTowards the charge, because it is for the generall good, and what by the\r\nmassacre and other accidents, Virginia is disparaged, and many men and\r\ntheir purses much discouraged, how ever a great many doe hasten to goe,\r\nthinking to bee next heires to all the former losses, I feare they will\r\nnot finde all things as they doe imagine; therefore leaving those gilded\r\nconceits, and dive into the true estate of the Colony; I thinke if his\r\nMajestie were truly informed of their necessitie, and the benefit of this\r\nproject, he would be pleased to give the custome of Virginia, and the\r\nPlanters also according to their abilities would adde thereto such a\r\ncontribution, as would be fit to maintaine this garison till they be able\r\nto subsist, or cause some such other collections to be made, as may put it\r\nwith all expedition in practice; otherwise it is much to be doubted, there\r\nwill neither come custome, nor any thing from thence to England within\r\nthese few yeares.\r\n\r\nNow if this should be thought an imploiment more fit for ancient Souldiers\r\nthere bred, then such new commers as may goe with me; you may please to\r\nleave that to my discretion, to accept or refuse such voluntaries, that\r\nwill hazard their fortunes in the trialls of these events, and discharge\r\nsuch of my company that had rather labour the ground then subdue their\r\nenemies: what releefe I should have from your Colony I would satisfie and\r\nspare them (when I could) the like courtesie. Notwithstanding these\r\ndoubts, I hope to feede them as well as defend them, and yet discover you\r\nmore land unknowne then they all yet know, if you will grant me such\r\npriviledges as of necessity must be used.\r\n\r\nFor against any enemy we must be ready to execute the best can be devised\r\nby your state there, but not that they shall either take away my men, or\r\nany thing else to imploy as they please by vertue of their authority, and\r\nin that I have done somewhat for New-England as well as Virginia, so I\r\nwould desire liberty and authority to make the best use I can of my best\r\nexperiences, within the limits of those two Patents, and to bring them\r\nboth in one Map, and the Countries betwixt them, giving alwaies that\r\nrespect to the Governors and government, as an Englishman doth in\r\nScotland, or a Scotchman in England, or as the regiments in the\r\nLow-countries doe to the Governors of the Townes and Cities where they are\r\nbillited, or in Garrison, where though they live with [IV.153.] them, and\r\nare as their servants to defend them, yet not to be disposed on at their\r\npleasure, but as the Prince and State doth command them, and for my owne\r\npaines in particular I aske not any thing but what I can produce from the\r\nproper labour of the Salvages.\r\n\r\n                           _Their Answer._\r\n\r\nI cannot say, it was generally for the Company, for being published in\r\ntheir Court, the most that heard it liked exceeding well of the motion,\r\nand some would have been very large Adventurers in it, especially Sir John\r\nBrookes and Master David Wyffin, but there were such divisions amongst\r\nthem, I could obtaine no answer but this, the charge would be too great;\r\ntheir stocke was decayed, and they did thinke the Planters should doe that\r\nof themselves if I could finde meanes to effect it; they did thinke I\r\nmight have leave of the Company, provided they might have halfe the\r\npillage, but I thinke there are not many will much strive for that\r\nimploiment, for except it be a little Corne at some time of the yeere is\r\nto be had, I would not give twenty pound for all the pillage is to be got\r\namongst the Salvages in twenty yeeres: but because they supposed I spake\r\nonly for my owne ends, it were good those understand providents for the\r\nCompanies good they so much talke of, were sent thither to make triall of\r\ntheir profound wisdomes and long experiences.\r\n\r\n                     _The manner of the Sallary._\r\n\r\nAbout this time also was propounded a proposition concerning a Sallery of\r\nfive and twenty thousand pounds to be raised out of Tobacco, as a yeerely\r\npension to bee paid to certaine Officers for the erecting a new office,\r\nconcerning the sole importation of Tobacco, besides his Majesties custome,\r\nfraught, and all other charges. To nominate the undertakers, favourers and\r\nopposers, with their arguments (pro) and (con) would bee too tedious and\r\nneedlesse being so publikely knowne; the which to establish, spent a good\r\npart of that yeere, and the beginning of the next. This made many thinke\r\nwonders of Virginia, to pay such pensions extraordinary to a few here that\r\nwere never there, and also in what state and pompe some Chieftaines and\r\ndivers of their associates live in Virginia, and yet no money to maintaine\r\na Garrison, pay poore men their wages, nor yet five and twenty pence to\r\nall the Adventurers here, and very little to the most part of the Planters\r\nthere, bred such differences in opinion it was dissolved.\r\n\r\n      _Captaine Croshaw staies at Patawomek, and his adventures._\r\n\r\nNow let us returne to Captaine Croshaw at Patawomek, where he had not\r\nbeene long ere Opechancanough sent two baskets of beads to this King, to\r\nkill him and his man, assuring him of the Massacre he had made, and that\r\nbefore the end of two Moones there should not be an Englishman in all\r\ntheir Countries: this fearefull message the King told this Captaine, who\r\nreplied, he had seene both the cowardise and trechery of Opechancanough\r\nsufficiently tried by Captaine Smith, therefore his threats he feared not,\r\nnor for his favour cared, but would nakedly fight with him or any of his\r\nwith their owne swords; if he were slaine, he would leave a letter for his\r\nCountry men to know, the fault was his owne, not the Kings; two daies the\r\nKing deliberated upon an answer, at last told him the English were his\r\nfriends, and the Salvage Emperour Opitchapam now called Toyatan, was his\r\nbrother, therefore there should be no bloud shed betwixt them, so hee\r\nreturned the Presents, willing the Pamaunkes to come no more in his\r\nCountry, lest the English, though against his will, should doe them any\r\nmischiefe.\r\n\r\n                  _The escape of Waters and his Wife._\r\n\r\nNot long after, a Boat going abroad to seeke out some releefe amongst the\r\nPlantations, by Nuports-newes met such ill weather, though the men were\r\nsaved they lost their boat, which the storme and waves cast upon the shore\r\nof Nandsamund, where Edward Waters one of the three that first stayed in\r\nSummer Iles, and found the great peece of Amber-greece, dwelling in\r\nVirginia at this [IV.154.] Massacre, hee and his wife these Nandsamunds\r\nkept Prisoners till it chanced they found this Boat, at which purchase\r\nthey so rejoyced, according to their custome of triumph, with songs,\r\ndances and invocations, they were so busied, that Waters and his wife\r\nfound opportunity to get secretly into their Canow, and so crossed the\r\nRiver to Kecoughtan, which is nine or ten miles, whereat the English no\r\nlesse wondred and rejoyced, then the Salvages were madded with discontent.\r\nThus you may see how many desperate dangers some men escape, when others\r\ndie that have all things at their pleasure.\r\n\r\n          _The arrivall of Captaine Hamer at Patawomeke._\r\n\r\n            _Croshaws Fort and plot for trade._ {MN}\r\n\r\nAll men thinking Captaine Croshaw dead, Captaine Hamer arriving with a\r\nShip and a Pinnace at Patawomeke, was kindly entertained both by him and\r\nthe King; that Don Hamar told the King he came for Corne: the King\r\nreplied hee had none, but the Nacotchtanks and their confederats had,\r\nwhich were enemies both to him and them; if they would fetch it, he would\r\ngive them 40. or 50 choise Bow-men to conduct and assist them. Those\r\nSalvages with some of the English they sent, who so well played their\r\nparts, they slew 18. of the Nacotchtanks, some write but 4. and some they\r\nhad a long skirmish with them; where the Patawomeks were so eager of\r\nrevenge, they drive them not onely out of their towne, but all out of\r\nsight through the woods, thus taking what they liked, and spoiling the\r\nrest, they retired to Patawomek, where they left Captaine Croshaw, with\r\nfoure men more, the rest set saile for James towne. {MN} Captaine Croshaw\r\nnow with five men and himselfe found night and day so many Alarums, he\r\nretired into such a convenient place, that with the helpe of the Salvages,\r\nhee had quickly fortified himselfe against all those wilde enemies.\r\nCaptaine Nuse his Pinnace meeting Hamar by the way understanding all this,\r\ncame to see Captaine Croshaw: after their best enterchanges of courtesies,\r\nCroshaw writ to Nuse the estate of the place where he was, but\r\nunderstanding by them the poore estate of the Colony, offered if they\r\nwould send him but a bold Shallop, with men, armes and provision for\r\ntrade, the next Harvest he would provide them Corne sufficient, but as yet\r\nit being but the latter end of June, there was little or none in all the\r\nCountry.\r\n\r\n                 _Captaine Madyson sent to Patawomek._\r\n\r\nThis being made knowne to the Governour and the rest, they sent Captaine\r\nMadyson with a ship and pinnace, and Some six and thirtie men: those\r\nCroshaw a good time taught the use of their armes, but receiving a letter\r\nfrom Boyse his Wife, a prisoner with nineteene more at Pamaunke, to use\r\nmeanes to the Governour for their libertie; So hee dealt with this King,\r\nhee got first two of his great men to goe with him to James towne, and\r\neight daies after to send foure of his counsell to Pamaunke, there to stay\r\ntill he sent one of his two to them, to perswade Opachankanough to send\r\ntwo of his with two of the Patawomekes, to treat about those prisoners,\r\nand the rest should remaine their hostage at Pamaunke; but the Commanders,\r\nat James towne, it seemes, liked not of it, and so sent the Patawomekes\r\nbacke againe to their owne Countrie, and Captaine Croshaw to his owne\r\nhabitation.\r\n\r\n                 _The industry of Captaine Nuse._\r\n\r\nAll this time we have forgot Captaine Nuse, where we left him but newly\r\nacquainted with the Massacre, calling all his next adjoyning dispersed\r\nneighbours together, he regarded not the pestring his owne house, nor any\r\nthing to releeve them, and with all speed entrenched himselfe, mounted\r\nthree peece of Ordnance, so that within 14. daies, he was strong enough to\r\ndefend himselfe from all the Salvages, yet when victuall grew scant, some\r\nthat would forrage without order, which he punished, neere occasioned a\r\nmutiny. Notwithstanding, he behaved himselfe so fatherly and kindly to\r\nthem all, they built two houses for them, he daily expected from England,\r\na faire Well of fresh water mantled with bricke, because the River and\r\nCricks are there brackish or salt; in all which things he plaied the\r\nSawyer, Carpenter, Dauber, Laborer, or any thing; wherein though his\r\ncourage and heart were steeled, he found his body was not made of Iron,\r\nfor hee had many sicknesses, and at last a Dropsie, no lesse griefe to\r\nhimselfe, then sorrow to his Wife and all under his government. These\r\ncrosses [IV.155.] and losses were no small increasers of his malady, nor\r\nthe thus abandoning our Plantations, the losse of our Harvest, and also\r\nTobacco which was as our money; the Vineyard our Vineyetours had brought\r\nto a good forwardnesse, bruised and destroyed with Deere, and all things\r\nere they came to perfection, with weeds, disorderly persons or wild\r\nbeasts; so that as we are I cannot perceive but the next yeere will be\r\nworse, being still tormented with pride and flattery, idlenesse and\r\ncovetousnesse, as though they had vowed heere to keepe their Court with\r\nall the pestilent vices in the world for their attendants, inchanted with\r\na conceited statelinesse, even in the very bottome of miserable\r\nsenselesnesse.\r\n\r\n               _Captaine Powel kills_ 3. _Salvages._\r\n\r\nShortly after, Sir George Yearly and Captaine William Powel, tooke each of\r\nthem a company of well disposed Gentlemen and others to seeke their\r\nenemies. Yearley ranging the shore of Weanock, could see nothing but their\r\nold houses which he burnt, and so went home: Powel searching another part,\r\nfound them all fled but three he met by chance, whose heads hee cut off,\r\nburnt their houses, and so returned; for the Salvages are so light and\r\nswift, though wee see them (being so loaded with armour) they have much\r\nadvantage of us though they be cowards.\r\n\r\n                   _The opinion of Captaine Smith._\r\n\r\nI confesse this is true, and it may cause some suppose they are grown\r\ninvincible: but will any goe to catch a Hare with a Taber and a Pipe? for\r\nwho knowes not though there be monsters both of men and beasts, fish and\r\nfowle, yet the greatest, the strongest, the wildest, cruellest, fiercest\r\nand cunningest, by reason, art and vigilancy, courage and industry hath\r\nbeene slaine, subjected or made tame, and those are still but Salvages as\r\nthey were, onely growne more bold by our owne simplicities, and still will\r\nbe worse and worse till they be tormented with a continuall pursuit, and\r\nnot with lying inclosed within Palizados, or affrighting them out of your\r\nsights, thinking they have done well, can but defend themselves: and to\r\ndoe this to any purpose, will require both charge, patience and\r\nexperience. But to their proceedings.\r\n\r\n             _Sir George Yearlys journey to Accomack._\r\n\r\n                 _Captaine Nuse his misery._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                  _An Alarum. Foure slaine._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nAbout the latter end of June, Sir George Yearley accompanied with the\r\nCouncell, and a number of the greatest Gallants in the Land, stayed three\r\nor foure daies with Captaine Nuse, he making his moane to a chiefe man\r\namongst them for want of provision for his Company, the great Commander\r\nreplied hee should turne them to his greene Corne, which would make them\r\nplumpe and fat: these fields being so neere the Fort, were better regarded\r\nand preserved then the rest, but the great mans command, as we call them,\r\nwas quickly obeied, for though it was scarce halfe growne either to the\r\ngreatnesse or goodnesse, they devoured it greene though it did them small\r\ngood. Sir George with his company went to Accomack to his new Plantation,\r\nwhere he staied neere six weekes; some Corne he brought home, but as he\r\nadventured for himselfe, he accordingly enjoyed the benefit; some pety\r\nMagazines came this Summer, but either the restraint by Proclamation, or\r\nwant of Boats, or both, caused few but the Chieftaines to be little better\r\nby them. {MN-1} So long as Captaine Nuse had any thing we had part; but\r\nnow all being spent, and the people forced to live upon Oisters and Crabs,\r\nthey became so faint no worke could be done; and where the Law was, no\r\nworke, no meat, now the case is altered, to no meat, no worke; some small\r\nquantity of Milke and Rice the Captaine had of his owne, and that he would\r\ndistribute gratis as he saw occasion; I say gratis, for I know no place\r\nelse, but it was sold for ready paiment: those eares of Corne that had\r\nescaped till August, though not ripe by reason of the late planting, the\r\nvery Dogs did repaire to the Corne fields to seeke them as the men till\r\nthey were hanged; and this I protest before God is true that I have\r\nrelated, not to flatter Nuse, nor condemne any, but all the time I have\r\nlived in Virginia, I have not seene nor heard that any Commander hath\r\ntaken such continuall paines for the publike, or done so little good for\r\nhimselfe, and his vertuous wife was no lesse charitable and compassionate\r\naccording to her power. For my owne part, although I found neither\r\nMulberies planted, houses built, men nor victuall provided, as the\r\nhonourable Adventurers [IV.156.] did promise mee in England; yet at my\r\nowne charge, having made these preparations, and the silke-Wormes ready to\r\nbe covered, all was lost, but my poore life and children, by the Massacre,\r\nthe which as God in his mercy did preserve, I continually pray we may\r\nspend to his glory. {MN-2} The 9. of September, we had an alarum, and two\r\nmen at their labours slaine; the Captaine, though extreme sicke, sallied\r\nforth, but the Salvages lay hid in the Corne fields all night, where they\r\ndestroyed all they could, and killed two men more, much mischiefe they did\r\nto Master Edward Hills cattle, yet he alone defended his house though his\r\nmen were sicke and could doe nothing, and this was our first assault since\r\nthe Massacre.\r\n\r\n               _The kindnesse of the King of Patawomek._\r\n\r\nAbout this time Captaine Madyson passed by us, having taken Prisoners, the\r\nKing of Patawomek, his sonne, and two more, and thus it happened; Madyson\r\nnot liking so well to live amongst the Salvages as Croshaw did, built him\r\na strong house within the Fort, so that they were not so sociable as\r\nbefore, nor did they much like Poole the Interpreter; many Alarums they\r\nhad, but saw no enemies: Madyson before his building went to Moyaoncs,\r\nwhere hee got provision for a moneth, and was promised much more, so he\r\nreturned to Patawomek and built this house, and was well used by the\r\nSalvages. Now by the foure great men the King sent to Pamaunke for the\r\nredemption of the Prisoners, Madyson sent them a letter, but they could\r\nneither deliver it nor see them: so long they stayed that the King grew\r\ndoubtfull of their bad usage, that hee swore by the Skyes, if they\r\nreturned not well, he would have warres with Opechankanough so long as he\r\nhad any thing: at this time two of Madysons men ranne from him, to finde\r\nthem he sent Master John Upton and three more with an Indian guide to\r\nNazatica, where they heard they were. At this place was a King beat out of\r\nhis Country by the Necosts, enemies to the Patawomeks; this expulsed King\r\nthough he professed much love to the Patawomeks, yet hee loved not the\r\nKing because he would not helpe him to revenge his injuries, but to our\r\nInterpreter Poole hee protested great love, promising if any treason were,\r\nhe would reveale it; our guide conducted this Bandyto with them up to\r\nPatawomek, and there kept him; our Fugitives we found the Patawomeks had\r\ntaken and brought home, and the foure great men returned from Pamaunke;\r\nnot long after, this expulsed King desired private conference with Poole,\r\nurging him to sweare by his God never to reveale what hee would tell him,\r\nPoole promised he would not; then quoth this King, those great men that\r\nwent to Pamaunke, went not as you suppose they pretended, but to contract\r\nwith Opechankanough how to kill you all here, and these are their plots.\r\n\r\n                      _A Salvages policy._\r\n\r\nFirst, they will procure halfe of you to goe a fishing to their furthest\r\ntowne, and there set upon them, and cut off the rest; if that faile, they\r\nwill faine a place where are many strangers would trade their Furres,\r\nwhere they will perswade halfe of you to goe trade, and there murder you\r\nand kill them at home; and if this faile also, then they will make Alarums\r\ntwo nights together, to tire you out with watching, and then set upon you,\r\nyet of all this, said he, there is none acquainted but the King and the\r\ngreat Conjurer.\r\n\r\n            _Madyson takes the King and kils_ 30. _or_ 40.\r\n\r\n                 _The King set at liberty._  {MN}\r\n\r\nThis being made known to the Captain, we all stood more punctually upon\r\nour guard, at which the Salvages wondering, desired to know the cause; we\r\ntold them we expected some assault from the Pamaunkes, whereat they seemed\r\ncontented, and the next day the King went on hunting with two of our men,\r\nand the other a fishing and abroad as before, till our Shallop returned\r\nfrom James towne with the two Salvages, sent home with Captaine Croshaw:\r\nby those the Governour sent to Madyson, that this King should send him\r\ntwelve of his great men; word of this was sent to the King at another\r\ntowne where he was, who not comming presently with the Messenger, Madyson\r\nconceited hee regarded not the message, and intended as he supposed the\r\nsame treason. The next morning the King comming home, being sent for, he\r\ncame to the Captaine and brought him a dish of their daintiest fruit; then\r\nthe Captaine fained his returne to James towne, the King told him he might\r\nif he would, [IV.157.] but desired not to leave him destitute of aid,\r\nhaving so many enemies about him; the Captaine told him he would leave a\r\nguard, but intreated his answer concerning the twelve great men for the\r\nGovernour; the King replied, his enemies lay so about him he could not\r\nspare them, then the Captaine desired his sonne and one other; my sonne,\r\nsaid the King, is gone abroad about businesse, but the other you desire\r\nyou shall have, and that other sits by him, but that man refused to goe,\r\nwhereupon Madyson went forth and locked the doore, leaving the King, his\r\nsonne, and foure Salvages, and five English men in the strong house, and\r\nsetting upon the towne with the rest of his men, slew thirty or forty men,\r\nwomen and children; the King demanding the cause, Poole told him the\r\ntreason, crying out to intreat the Captaine cease from such cruelty: but\r\nhaving slaine and made flye all in the towne, hee returned, taxing the\r\npoore King of treason, who denied to the death not to know of any such\r\nmatter, but said, This is some plot of them that told it, onely to kill\r\nmee for being your friend. Then Madyson willed him, to command none of\r\nhis men should shoot at him as he went aboord, which he presently did, and\r\nit was performed: so Madyson departed, leading the King, his sonne, and\r\ntwo more to his ship, promising when all his men were shipped, he should\r\nreturne at libertie; {MN} notwithstanding he brought them to James towne,\r\nwhere they lay some daies, and after were sent home by Captaine Hamer,\r\nthat tooke Corne for their ransome, and after set saile for New found\r\nLand.\r\n\r\n    But, alas the cause of this was onely this\r\n    They understood, nor knew what was amisse.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           A.D. 1622.\r\n\r\n                        _A digression._\r\n\r\nEver since the beginning of these Plantations, it hath beene supposed the\r\nKing of Spaine would invade them, or our English Papists indevour to\r\ndissolve them. But neither all the Counsels of Spaine, nor Papists in the\r\nworld could have devised a better course to bring them all to ruine, then\r\nthus to abuse their friends, nor could there ever have beene a better\r\nplot, to have overthrowne Opechankanough then Captaine Chroshaws, had it\r\nbeene fully managed with expedition. But it seemes God is angry to see\r\nVirginia made a stage where nothing but murder and indiscretion contends\r\nfor victory.\r\n\r\n            _Their proceedings of the other plantations._\r\n\r\n                  300 _surpriseth Nandsamund._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                   _Samuell Collyer slaine._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nAmongst the rest of the Plantations all this Summer little was done, but\r\nsecuring themselves and planting Tobacco, which passes there as current\r\nSilver, and by the oft turning and winding it, some grow rich, but many\r\npoore, notwithstanding ten or twelve ships or more hath arrived there\r\nsince the massacre, although it was Christmas ere any returned, and that\r\nreturne greatly revived all mens longing expectation here in England: for\r\nthey brought newes, that notwithstanding their extreme sicknesse many were\r\nrecovered, and finding the Salvages did not much trouble them, except it\r\nwere sometimes some disorderly straglers they cut off. To lull them the\r\nbetter in securitie, they sought no revenge till their Corne was ripe,\r\n{MN-1} then they drew together three hundred of the best Souldiers they\r\ncould, that would leave their private businesse, and adventure themselves\r\namongst the Salvages to surprize their Corne, under the conduct of Sir\r\nGeorge Yearley, being imbarked in convenient shipping, and all things\r\nnecessary for the enterprise, they went first to Nandsamund, where the\r\npeople set fire on their owne houses, and spoiled what they could, and\r\nthen fled with what they could carry; so that the English did make no\r\nslaughter amongst them for revenge. Their Corne fields being newly\r\ngathered, they surprized all they found, burnt the houses remained\r\nunburnt, and so departed. Quartering about Kecoughtan, after the Watch was\r\nset, {MN-2} Samuell Collyer one of the most ancientest Planters, and very\r\nwell acquainted with their language and habitation, humors and conditions,\r\nand Governor of a Towne, when the Watch was set going the round,\r\nunfortunately by a Centinell that discharged his peece, was slaine.\r\n\r\n                     _They surprise Pamaunke._\r\n\r\nThence they sailed to Pamaunke, the chiefe seat of Opechankanough,\r\n[IV.158.] the contriver of the massacre: the Salvages seemed exceeding\r\nfearefull, promising to bring them Sara, and the rest of the English yet\r\nliving, with all the Armes, and what they had to restore, much desiring\r\npeace, and to give them any satisfaction they could. Many such devices\r\nthey fained to procrastinate the time ten or twelve daies, till they had\r\ngot away their Corne from all the other places up the River, but that\r\nwhere the English kept their quarter: at last, when they saw all those\r\npromises were but delusions, they seised on all the Corne there was, set\r\nfire on their houses: and in following the Salvages that fled before them,\r\nsome few of those naked Devils had that spirit, they lay in ambuscado, and\r\nas our men marched discharged some shot out of English peeces, and hurt\r\nsome of them flying at their pleasures where they listed, burning their\r\nempty houses before them as they went to make themselves sport: so they\r\nescaped, and Sir George returned with Corne, where for our paines we had\r\nthree bushels apeece, but we were enjoyned before we had it, to pay ten\r\nshillings the bushell for fraught and other charges. Thus by this meanes\r\nthe Salvages are like as they report, to endure no small misery this\r\nWinter, and that some of our men are returned to their former Plantations.\r\n\r\n                 _The opinion of Captaine Smith._\r\n\r\nWhat other passages or impediments hapned in their proceedings, that they\r\nwere not fully revenged of the Salvages before they returned, I know not;\r\nnor could ever heare more, but that they supposed they slew two, and how\r\nit was impossible for any men to doe more then they did: yet worthy\r\nFerdinando Courtus had scarce three hundred Spaniards to conquer the great\r\nCitie of Mexico, where thousands of Salvages dwelled in strong houses: but\r\nbecause they were a civilized people, had wealth, and those meere\r\nBarbarians as wilde as beasts have nothing; I intreat your patience to\r\ntell you my opinion, which if it be Gods pleasure I shall not live to put\r\nin practice, yet it may be hereafter usefull for some, but howsoever I\r\nhope not hurtfull to any, and this it is.\r\n\r\n       _How to subject all the Salvages in Virginia._\r\n\r\nHad these three hundred men beene at my disposing, I would have sent first\r\none hundred to Captaine Rawley Chroshaw to Patawomek, with some small\r\nOrdnance for the Fort, the which but with daily exercising them, would\r\nhave struck that love and admiration into the Patowomeks, and terror and\r\namazement into his enemies, which are not farre off, and most seated upon\r\nthe other side the River, they would willingly have beene friends, or have\r\ngiven any composition they could, before they would be tormented with such\r\na visible feare.\r\n\r\nNow though they be generally perfidious, yet necessity constraines those\r\nto a kinde of constancy because of their enemies, and neither my selfe\r\nthat first found them, Captaine Argall, Chroshow, nor Hamar, never found\r\nthemselves in fifteene yeares trials: nor is it likely now they would have\r\nso hostaged their men, suffer the building of a Fort, and their women and\r\nchildren amongst them, had they intended any villany; but suppose they\r\nhad, who would have desired a better advantage then such an advertisement,\r\nto have prepared the Fort for such an assault, and surely it must be a\r\npoore Fort they could hurt, much more take, if there were but five men in\r\nit durst discharge a peece: Therefore a man not well knowing their\r\nconditions, may be as wel too jealous as too carelesse; Such another Lope\r\nSkonce would I have had at Onawmanient, and one hundred men more to have\r\nmade such another at Atquacke upon the River of Toppahanock, which is not\r\npast thirteene miles distant from Onawmanient: each of which twelve men\r\nwould keepe, as well as twelve thousand, and spare all the rest to bee\r\nimploied as there should be occasion. And all this with these numbers\r\nmight easily have beene done, if not by courtesie, yet by compulsion,\r\nespecially at that time of September when all their fruits were ripe,\r\ntheir beasts fat, and infinite numbers of wilde Fowle began to repaire to\r\nevery creeke, that men if they would doe any thing, could not want\r\nvictuall. This done, there remained yet one hundred who should have done\r\nthe like at Ozinieke, upon the River of Chickahamania, not past six miles\r\n[IV.159.] from the chiefe habitations of Opechankanough. These small Forts\r\nhad beene cause sufficient to cause all the Inhabitants of each of those\r\nRivers to looke to themselves. Then having so many Ships, Barks, and Boats\r\nin Virginia as there was at that present, with what facility might you\r\nhave landed two hundred and twentie men, if you had but onely five or six\r\nBoats in one night; forty to range the branch of Mattapanyent, fortie more\r\nthat of Youghtanund, and fortie more to keepe their randivous at Pamaunke\r\nit selfe. All which places lie so neere, they might heare from each other\r\nwithin foure or five houres, and not any of those small parties, if there\r\nwere any valour, discretion, or industry in them, but as sufficient as\r\nfoure thousand, to force them all to contribution, or take or spoile all\r\nthey had. For having thus so many convenient randevous to releeve each\r\nother, though all the whole Countries had beene our enemies, where could\r\nthey rest, but in the depth of Winter we might burne all the houses upon\r\nall those Rivers in two or three daies? Then without fires they could not\r\nlive, which they could not so hide but wee should finde, and quickly so\r\ntire them with watching and warding, they would be so weary of their\r\nlives, as either fly all their Countries, or give all they had to be\r\nreleased of such an hourely misery. Now if but a small number of the\r\nSalvages would assist us, as there is no question but divers of them\r\nwould; And to suppose they could not be drawne to such faction, were to\r\nbeleeve they are more vertuous then many Christians, and the best governed\r\npeople in the world. All the Pamaunkes might have beene dispatched as well\r\nin a moneth as a yeare, and then to have dealt with any other enemies at\r\nour pleasure, and yet made all this toile and danger but a recreation.\r\n\r\nIf you think this strange or impossible, 12 men with my selfe I found\r\nsufficient, to goe where I would adaies, and surprise a house with the\r\npeople, if not a whole towne in a night, or incounter all the power they\r\ncould make, as a whole Army, as formerly at large hath beene related: And\r\nit seemes by these small parties last amongst them, by Captaine Crashow,\r\nHamar, and Madyson, they are not growne to that excellency in policy and\r\ncourage but they might bee encountred, and their wives and children\r\napprehended. I know I shall bee taxed for writing so much of my selfe, but\r\nI care not much, because the judiciall know there are few such Souldiers\r\nas are my examples, have writ their owne actions, nor know I who will or\r\ncan tell my intents better then my selfe.\r\n\r\nSome againe finde as much fault with the Company for medling with so many\r\nPlantations together, because they that have many Irons in the fire some\r\nmust burne; but I thinke no if they have men enow know how to worke them,\r\nbut howsoever, it were better some burne then have none at all. The King\r\nof Spaine regards but how many powerfull Kingdomes he keepes under his\r\nobedience, and for the Salvage Countries he hath subjected, they are more\r\nthen enow for a good Cosmographer to nominate, and is three Mole-hills so\r\nmuch to us; and so many Empires so little for him? For my owne part, I\r\ncannot chuse but grieve, that the actions of an English-man should be\r\ninferior to any, and that the command of England should not be as great as\r\nany Monarchy that ever was since the world began, I meane not as a Tyrant\r\nto torment all Christendome, but to suppresse her disturbers, and conquer\r\nher enemies.\r\n\r\n    For the great Romans got into their hand\r\n    The whole worlds compasse, both by Sea and Land,\r\n    Or any seas, or heaven, or earth extended,\r\n    And yet that Nation could not be contented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           A.D. 1622.\r\n\r\n                  MASTER ARGENT'S DELIVERANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n      _The arrivall of Captaine Butler, & his accidents._\r\n\r\nMuch about this time arrived a small Barke of Barnestable, which had beene\r\nat the Summer Iles, and in her Captaine Nathaniel Butler, who having beene\r\nGovernor there three yeares, and his Commission expired, he tooke the\r\nopportunity of this ship to see Virginia: at James Towne he was kindly\r\nentertained by Sir Francis Wyat [IV.160.] the Governor. After he had\r\nrested there foureteene daies, he fell up with his ship to the River of\r\nChickahamania, where meeting Captaine William Powell, joyning together\r\nsuch forces as they had to the number of eighty, they set upon the\r\nChickahamanians, that fearefully fled, suffering the English to spoile all\r\nthey had, not daring to resist them. Thus he returned to James towne,\r\nwhere hee staied a moneth, at Kecoughtan as much more, and so returned for\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n           _A strange deliverance of Master Argent & others._\r\n\r\nBut riding at Kecoughtan, M. John Argent, sonne to Doctor Argent, a young\r\nGentleman that went with Captaine Butler from England to this place,\r\nMichael Fuller, William Gany, Cornelius May, and one other going ashore\r\nwith some goods late in a faire evening, such a sudden gust did arise,\r\nthat drive them thwart the River, in that place at least three or foure\r\nmiles in breadth, where the shore was so shallow at a low water, and the\r\nBoat beating upon the Sands, they left her, wading neere halfe a mile, and\r\noft up to the chin: So well it hapned, Master Argent had put his Bandileir\r\nof powder in his hat, which next God was all their preservations: for it\r\nbeing February, and the ground so cold, their bodies became so benumbed,\r\nthey were not able to strike fire with a steele and a stone hee had in his\r\npocket; the stone they lost twice, and thus those poore soules groping in\r\nthe darke, it was Master Argents chance to finde it, and with a few\r\nwithered leaves, reeds, and brush, make a small fire, being upon the\r\nChisapeaks shore, their mortall enemies, great was their feare to be\r\ndiscovered. The joyfull morning appearing, they found their Boat and goods\r\ndrive ashore, not farre from them, but so split shee was unserviceable:\r\nbut so much was the frost, their clothes did freeze upon their backs, for\r\nthey durst not make any great fire to dry them, lest thereby the bloudy\r\nSalvages might discry them, so that one of them died the next day, and the\r\nnext night digging a grave in the Sands with their hands, buried him. In\r\nthis bodily feare they lived and fasted two daies and nights, then two of\r\nthem went into the Land to seeke fresh water; the others to the Boat to\r\nget some meale and oyle, Argent and his Comrade found a Canow, in which\r\nthey resolved to adventure to their ship, but shee was a drift in the\r\nRiver before they returned: thus frustrate of all hopes, Captaine Butler\r\nthe third night ranging the shore in his Boat to seeke them, discharged\r\nhis Muskets, but they supposing it some Salvages had got some English\r\npeeces, they grew more perplexed then ever, so he returned and lost his\r\nlabour. The fourth day they unloaded their Boat, and stopping her leakes\r\nwith their handkerchiefes, and other rags, two rowing, and two bailing out\r\nthe water; but farre they went not ere the water grew upon them so fast,\r\nand they so tired, they thought themselves happy to be on shore againe,\r\nthough they perceived the Indians were not farre off by their fires. Thus\r\nat the very period of despaire, Fuller undertooke to sit a stride upon a\r\nlittle peece of an old Canow; so well it pleased God the wind and tide\r\nserved, by padling with his hands and feet in the water, beyond all\r\nexpectation God so guided him three or foure houres upon this boord, he\r\narrived at their ship, where they no lesse amazed then he tired, they\r\ntooke him in. Presently as he had concluded with his Companions, he caused\r\nthem discharge a peece of Ordnance if he escaped, which gave no lesse\r\ncomfort to Master Argent and the rest, then terror to those Plantations\r\nthat heard it, (being late) at such an unexpected alarum  but after, with\r\nwarme clothes and a little strong water, they had a little recovered him,\r\nsuch was his courage and care of his distressed friends, he returned that\r\nnight againe with Master Felgate to conduct him to them, and so giving\r\nthanks to God for so hopelesse a deliverance, it pleased his Divine power,\r\nboth they and their provision came safely aboord, but Fuller they doubt\r\nwill never recover his benumbed legs and thighes.\r\n\r\nNow before Butlers arrivall in England, many hard speeches were rumored\r\nagainst him for so leaving his charge, before he received order from the\r\nCompany: Divers againe of his Souldiers as highly commended him, for his\r\ngood government, art, judgement and industry. [IV.161.] But to make the\r\nmisery of Virginia appeare that it might be reformed in time, how all\r\nthose Cities, Townes, Corporations, Forts, Vineyards, Nurseries of\r\nMulberies, Glasse-houses, Iron forges, Guest-houses, Silke-wormes,\r\nColleges, the Companies great estate, and that plenty some doe speake of\r\nhere, are rather things in words and paper then in effect, with divers\r\nreasons of the causes of those defects; if it were false, his blame nor\r\nshame could not be too much: but if there bee such defects in the\r\ngovernment, and distresse in the Colony, it is thought by many it hath\r\nbeene too long concealed, and requireth rather reformation then\r\ndisputation: but however, it were not amisse to provide for the worst,\r\nfor the best will help it selfe. Notwithstanding, it was apprehended so\r\nhardly, and examined with that passion, that the brute thereof was spread\r\nabroad with that expedition, it did more hurt then the massacre; and the\r\nfault of all now by the vulgar rumour, must be attributed to the\r\nunwholesomnesse of the ayre, and barrennesse of the Countrey, as though\r\nall England were naught, because the Fens and Marshes are unhealthy; or\r\nbarren, because some will lie under windowes and starve in Cheap-side,\r\nrot in Goales, die in the street, high-waies, or any where, and use a\r\nthousand devices to maintaine themselves in those miseries, rather then\r\ntake any paines to live as they may by honest labour, and a great part of\r\nsuch like are the Planters of Virginia, and partly the occasion of those\r\ndefailements.\r\n\r\n                                   1623.\r\n               _The Earle of Southampton Treasurer._\r\n\r\n     _How Captaine Spilman was left in the River of Patawomek._\r\n\r\nIn the latter end of this last yeare, or the beginning of this, Captaine\r\nHenrie Spilman a Gentleman, that hath lived in those Countries thirteene\r\nor foureteene yeares, one of the best Interpreters in the Land, being\r\nfurnished with a Barke and six and twentie men, hee was sent to trucke in\r\nthe River of Patawomek, where he had lived a long time amongst the\r\nSalvages, whether hee presumed too much upon his acquaintance amongst\r\nthem, or they sought to be revenged of any for the slaughter made amongst\r\nthem by the English so lately, or hee sought to betray them, or they him,\r\nare all severall relations, but it seemes but imaginary: for then\r\nreturned report they left him ashore about Patawomek, but the name of the\r\nplace they knew not, with one and twentie men, being but five in the\r\nBarke, the Salvages ere they suspected any thing, boorded them with their\r\nCanowes, and entred so fast, the English were amazed, till a Sailer gave\r\nfire to a peece of Ordnance onely at randome; at the report whereof, the\r\nSalvages leapt overboord, so distracted with feare, they left their\r\nCanowes, and swum a shore; and presently after they heard a great brute\r\namongst the Salvages a shore, and saw a mans head throwne downe the banke,\r\nwhereupon they weighed Anchor and returned home, but how he was surprised\r\nor slaine, is uncertaine.\r\n\r\n    Thus things proceed and vary not a jot,\r\n    Whether we know them, or we know them not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        NECESSARIES FOR VIRGINIA\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A.D. 1623.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A particular of such necessaries as either private families, or single\r\n    persons, shall have cause to provide to goe to Virginia, whereby\r\n    greater numbers may in part conceive the better how to provide for\r\n    themselves.\r\n\r\n                               Apparell.\r\n\r\n         _Apprarell for one man, so after the rate for more._\r\n\r\n  A Monmouth Cap.                            1s. 10d.\r\n  3 falling bands.                           1s.  3d.\r\n  3 shirts.                                  7s.  6d.\r\n  1 Waste-coat.                              2s.  2d.\r\n  1 suit of Canvase.                         7s.  6d.\r\n  1 suit of Frize.                          10s.\r\n  1 suit of Cloth.                          15s.\r\n  3 paire of Irish stockings.                4s.\r\n  4 paire of shoes.                          8s.  8d.\r\n  1 paire of garters.                            10d.\r\n  1 dozen of points.                              3d.\r\n  1 paire of Canvas sheets.                  8s.

In this tract of James Towne River I know very few; some small\r\nMarshes and Swamps there are, but more profitable then hurtfull: and I\r\nthinke there is more low Marsh ground betwixt Eriffe and Chelsey, then\r\nKecoughton and the Falls, which is about one hundred and eighty miles by\r\nthe course of the River.\r\n\r\n                _The causes of our first miseries._\r\n\r\nBeing enjoyned by our Commission not to unplant nor wrong the Salvages,\r\nbecause the channell was so neere the shore, where now is James Towne,\r\nthen a thicke grove of trees; wee cut them downe, where the Salvages\r\npretending as much kindnesse as could bee, they hurt and slew one and\r\ntwenty of us in two houres: At this time our diet was for most part water\r\nand bran, and three ounces of little better stuffe in bread for five men\r\na meale, and thus we lived neere three moneths: our lodgings under boughes\r\nof trees, the Salvages being our enemies, whom we neither knew nor\r\nunderstood; occasions I thinke sufficient to make men sicke and die.\r\n\r\n               _But_ 38 _English in all Virginia._\r\n\r\nNecessity thus did inforce me with eight or nine, to try conclusions\r\namongst the Salvages, that we got provision which recovered the rest being\r\nmost sicke. Six weeks I was led captive by those Barbarians, though some\r\nof my men were slaine, and the rest fled, yet it pleased God to make their\r\ngreat Kings daughter the means to returne me safe to James towne, and\r\nreleeve our wants, and then our Common-wealth was in all eight and thirty,\r\nthe remainder of one hundred and five.\r\n\r\n          _Proofes of the healthfulnesse of the Countrey._\r\n\r\nBeing supplied with one hundred and twenty, with twelve men in a boat of\r\nthree tuns, I spent foureteene weeks in those large waters; the contents\r\nof the way of my boat protracted by the skale of proportion, was about\r\nthree thousand miles, besides the River we dwell upon, where no Christian\r\nknowne ever was, and our diet for the most part what we could finde, yet\r\nbut one died.\r\n\r\n                 _How the Salvages became subjected._\r\n\r\nThe Salvages being acquainted, that by command from England we durst not\r\nhurt them, were much imboldned; that famine and their insolencies did\r\nforce me to breake our Commission and instructions, cause Powhatan fly his\r\nCountrey, and take the King of Pamaunke Prisoner; and also to keepe the\r\nKing of Paspahegh in shackels, and put his men to double taskes in\r\nchaines, till nine and thirty of their Kings paied us contribution, and\r\nthe offending Salvages sent to James towne to punish at our owne\r\ndiscretions: in the two last yeares I staied there, I had not a man\r\nslaine.\r\n\r\n         _How we lived of the natural fruit of the Countrey._\r\n\r\nAll those conclusions being not able to prevent the bad events of pride\r\nand idlenesse, having received another supply of seventie, we were about\r\ntwo hundred in all, but not twentie work-men: In following the strict\r\ndirections from England to doe that was impossible at that time; So it\r\nhapned, that neither wee nor they had any thing to eat, but what the\r\nCountrey afforded naturally; yet of eightie who lived upon Oysters in June\r\nand July, with a pint of corne a week for a man lying under trees, and 120\r\nfor the most part living upon Sturgion, which was dried til we pounded it\r\nto powder for meale, yet in ten weeks but seven died.\r\n\r\n             _Proofe of the  Commodities we returned._\r\n\r\nIt is true, we had of Tooles, Armes, & Munition sufficient, some\r\nAquavitae, Vineger, Meale, Pease, and Otemeale, but in two yeares and a\r\nhalfe not sufficient for six moneths, though by the bils of loading the\r\nproportions sent us, would well have contented us, notwithstanding we sent\r\nhome ample proofes of Pitch, Tar, Sope Ashes, Wainskot, Clapboord, Silke\r\ngrasse, Iron Ore, some Sturgion and Glasse, Saxefras, Cedar, Cypris, and\r\nblacke Walnut, crowned Powhatan, sought the Monacans Countrey, according\r\nto the instructions sent us, but they caused us neglect more necessary\r\nworkes: they had better have given for Pitch and Sope ashes one hundred\r\npound a tun in Denmarke: Wee also maintained five or six severall\r\nPlantations.\r\n\r\n                         _What we built._\r\n\r\nJames towne being burnt, wee rebuilt it and three Forts more, besides the\r\nChurch and Store-house, we had about fortie or fiftie severall houses to\r\nkeepe us warme and dry, invironed with a palizado of foureteene or\r\nfifteene foot, and each as much as three or foure men could carrie. We\r\ndigged a faire Well of fresh water in the Fort, where wee had three\r\nBulwarks, foure and twentie peece of [IV.164.] Ordnance, of Culvering,\r\nDemiculvering, Sacar and Falcon, and most well mounted upon convenient\r\nplatformes, planted one hundred acres of Corne. We had but six ships to\r\ntransport and supply us, and but two hundred seventy seven men, boies, and\r\nwomen, by whose labours Virginia being brought to this kinde of\r\nperfection, the most difficulties past, and the foundation thus laid by\r\nthis small meanes; yet because we had done no more, they called in our\r\nCommission, tooke a new in their owne names, and appointed us neere as\r\nmany offices and Officers as I had Souldiers, that neither knew us nor wee\r\nthem, without our consents or knowledge; since there have gone more then\r\none hundred ships of other proportions, and eight or ten thousand people.\r\nNow if you please to compare what hath beene spent, sent, discovered and\r\ndone this fifteene yeares, by that we did in the three first yeares, and\r\nevery Governor that hath beene there since, give you but such an account\r\nas this, you may easily finde what hath beene the cause of those disasters\r\nin Virginia.\r\n\r\nThen came in Captaine Argall, and Master Sedan, in a ship of Master\r\nCornelius, to fish for Sturgion, who had such good provision, we\r\ncontracted with them for it, whereby we were better furnished then ever.\r\n\r\nNot long after came in seven ships, with about three hundred people; but\r\nrather to supplant us then supply us, their Admirall with their authoritie\r\nbeing cast away in the Bermudas, very angry they were we had made no\r\nbetter provision for them. Seven or eight weekes we withstood the\r\ninundations of these disorderly humors, till I was neere blowne to death\r\nwith Gun-powder, which occasioned me to returne for England.\r\n\r\n                 _How I left the Countrey._\r\n\r\nIn the yeare 1609 about Michaelmas, I left the Countrey, as is formerly\r\nrelated, with three ships, seven Boats, Commodities to trade, harvest\r\nnewly gathered, eight weeks provision of Corne and Meale, about five\r\nhundred persons, three hundred Muskets, shot, powder, and match, with\r\narmes for more men then we had. The Salvages their language and\r\nhabitation, well knowne to two hundred expert Souldiers; Nets for fishing,\r\ntooles of all sorts, apparell to supply their wants: six Mares and a\r\nHorse, five or six hundred Swine, many more Powltry, what was brought or\r\nbred, but victuall there remained.\r\n\r\n                         _My Charge._\r\n\r\n                        _My Reward._ {MN}\r\n\r\nHaving spent some five yeares, and more then five hundred pounds in\r\nprocuring the Letters Patents and setting forward, and neere as much more\r\nabout New England, &c. Thus these nineteene yeares I have here and there\r\nnot spared any thing according to my abilitie, nor the best advice I\r\ncould, to perswade how those strange miracles of misery might have beene\r\nprevented, which lamentable experience plainly taught me of necessity must\r\ninsue, but few would beleeve me till now too deerely they have paid for\r\nit. Wherefore hitherto I have rather left all then undertake\r\nimpossibilities, or any more such costly taskes at such chargeable rates:\r\n{MN} for in neither of those two Countries have I one foot of Land, nor\r\nthe very house I builded, nor the ground I digged with my owne hands, nor\r\never any content or satisfaction at all, and though I see ordinarily those\r\ntwo Countries shared before me by them that neither have them nor knowes\r\nthem, but by my descriptions: Yet that doth not so much trouble me, as to\r\nheare and see those contentions and divisions which will hazard if not\r\nruine the prosperitie of Virginia, if present remedy bee not found, as\r\nthey have hindred many hundreds, who would have beene there ere now, and\r\nmakes them yet that are willing to stand in a demurre.\r\n\r\nFor the Books and Maps I have made, I will thanke him that will shew me so\r\nmuch for so little recompence, and beare with their errors till I have\r\ndone better. For the materials in them I cannot deny, but am ready to\r\naffirme them both there and here, upon such grounds as I have propounded,\r\nwhich is to have but fifteene hundred men to subdue againe the Salvages,\r\nfortifie the Countrey, discover that yet unknowne, and both defend & feed\r\ntheir Colony, which I most humbly refer to his Majesties most judiciary\r\njudgement, and the most honourable Lords of [IV.165.] his Privy Councell,\r\nyou his trusty and well-beloved Commissioners, and the Honourable company\r\nof Planters and well-willers to Virginia, New-England and Sommer-Ilands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Out of these Observations it pleased his Majesties Commissioners for\r\n    the reformation of Virginia, to desire my answer to these seven\r\n    Questions.\r\n\r\nQuest. 1. What conceive you is the cause the Plantation hath prospered no\r\nbetter since you left it in so good a forwardnesse?\r\n\r\nAnsw. Idlenesse and carelesnesse brought all I did in three yeeres in six\r\nmoneths to nothing, and of five hundred I left, scarce threescore\r\nremained, and had Sir Thomas Gates not got from the Bermudas, I thinke\r\nthey had beene all dead before they could be supplied.\r\n\r\nQuest. 2. What conceive you should be the cause, though the Country be\r\ngood, there comes nothing but Tobacco?\r\n\r\nAnsw. The oft altering of Governours it seemes causes every man make use\r\nof his time, and because Corne was stinted at two shillings six pence the\r\nbushell, and Tobacco at three shillings the pound, and they value a mans\r\nlabour a yeere worth fifty or threescore pound, but in Corne not worth ten\r\npound, presuming Tobacco will furnish them with all things; now make a\r\nmans labour in Corne worth threescore pound, and in Tobacco but ten pound\r\na man, then shall they have Corne sufficient to entertaine all commers,\r\nand keepe their people in health to doe any thing, but till then, there\r\nwill be little or nothing to any purpose.\r\n\r\nQuest. 3. What conceive you to have beene the cause of the Massacre, and\r\nhad the Salvages had the use of any peeces in your time, or when, or by\r\nwhom they were taught?\r\n\r\nAnsw. The cause of the Massacre was the want of marshall discipline, and\r\nbecause they would have all the English had by destroying those they found\r\nso carelesly secure, that they were not provided to defend themselves\r\nagainst any enemy, being so dispersed as they were. In my time, though\r\nCaptaine Nuport furnished them with swords by truck, and many fugitives\r\ndid the like, and some Peeces they got accidentally, yet I got the most\r\nof them againe, and it was death to him that should shew a Salvage the use\r\nof a Peece. Since I understand they became so good shot, they were\r\nimployed for Fowlers and Huntsmen by the English.\r\n\r\nQuest. 4. What charge thinke you would have setled the government both for\r\ndefence and planting when you left it?\r\n\r\nAnsw. Twenty thousand pound would have hyred good labourers and\r\nmechanicall men, and have furnished them with cattle and all necessaries,\r\nand 100. of them would have done more then a thousand of those that went,\r\nthough the Lord Laware, Sir Ferdinando Waynman, Sir Thomas Gates and Sir\r\nThomas Dale were perswaded to the contrary, but when they had tried, they\r\nconfessed their error.\r\n\r\nQuest. 5. What conceive you would be the remedy and the charge?\r\n\r\nAnsw. The remedy is to send Souldiers and all sorts of labourers and\r\nnecessaries for them, that they may be there by next Michaelmas, the which\r\nto doe well will stand you in five thousand pound, but if his Majesty\r\nwould please to lend two of his Ships to transport them, lesse would\r\nserve, besides the benefit of his grace to the action would encourage all\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nQuest. 6. What thinke you are the defects of the government both here and\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nAnsw. The multiplicity of opinions here, and Officers there, makes such\r\ndelaies by questions and formalitie, [IV.166.] that as much time is spent\r\nin complement as in action; besides, some are so desirous to imploy their\r\nships, having six pounds for every Passenger, and three pounds for every\r\ntun of goods, at which rate a thousand ships may now better be procured\r\nthen one at the first, when the common stocke defrayed all fraughts,\r\nwages, provisions and Magazines, whereby the Ships are so pestred, as\r\noccasions much sicknesse, diseases and mortality, for though all the\r\nPassengers die they are sure of their fraught; and then all must be\r\nsatisfied with Orations, disputations, excuses and hopes. As for the\r\nletters of advice from hence, and their answers thence, they are so well\r\nwritten, men would beleeve there were no great doubt of the performance,\r\nand that all things were wel, to which error here they have beene ever\r\nmuch subject; and there not to beleeve, or not to releeve the true and\r\npoore estate of that Colony, whose fruits were commonly spent before they\r\nwere ripe, and this losse is nothing to them here, whose great estates are\r\nnot sensible of the losse of their adventures, and so they thinke, or will\r\nnot take notice; but it is so with all men: but howsoever they thinke or\r\ndispose of all things at their pleasure, I am sure not my selfe onely, but\r\na thousand others have not onely spent the most of their estates, but the\r\nmost part have lost their lives and all, onely but to make way for the\r\ntriall of more new conclusions, and he that now will adventure but twelve\r\npounds ten shillings, shall have better respect and as much favour then he\r\nthat sixteene yeere agoe adventured as much, except he have money as the\r\nother hath, but though he have adventured five hundred pound, and spent\r\nthere never so much time, if hee have no more and not able to beg in a\r\nfamily of himselfe, all is lost by order of Court.\r\n\r\nBut in the beginning it was not so, all went then out of one purse, till\r\nthose new devices have consumed both mony and purse; for at first there\r\nwere but six Patentees, now more then a thousand, then but thirteene\r\nCounsailors, now not lesse then an hundred; I speake not of all, for there\r\nare some both honourable and honest, but of those Officers, which did they\r\nmanage their owne estates no better then the affaires of Virginia, they\r\nwould quickly fall to decay so well as it; but this is most evident, few\r\nOfficers in England it hath caused to turne Banquerupts, nor for all their\r\ncomplaints would leave their places, neither yet any of their Officers\r\nthere, nor few of the rest but they would be at home, but fewer\r\nAdventurers here will adventure any more till they see the businesse\r\nbetter established, although there be some so wilfully improvident they\r\ncare for nothing but to get thither, and then if their friends be dead, or\r\nwant themselves, they die or live but poorely for want of necessaries, and\r\nto thinke the old Planters can releeve them were too much simplicity; for\r\nwho here in England is so charitable to feed two or three strangers, have\r\nthey never so much; much lesse in Virginia where they want for themselves.\r\nNow the generall complaint saith, that pride, covetousnesse, extortion and\r\noppression in a few that ingrosses all, then sell all againe to the\r\ncomminalty at what rate they please, yea even men, women and children for\r\nwho will give most, occasions no small mischiefe amongst the Planters.\r\n\r\nAs for the Company, or those that doe transport them, provided of\r\nnecessaries, God forbid but they should receive their charges againe with\r\nadvantage, or that masters there should not have the same privilege over\r\ntheir servants as here, but to sell him or her for forty, fifty, or\r\nthreescore pounds, whom the Company hath sent over for eight or ten pounds\r\nat the most, without regard how they shall be maintained with apparell,\r\nmeat, drinke and lodging, is odious, and their fruits sutable, therefore\r\nsuch merchants it were better they were made such merchandize themselves,\r\nthen suffered any longer to use that trade, and those are defects\r\nsufficient to bring a well setled Common-wealth to misery, much more\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nQuest. 7. How thinke you it may be rectified?\r\n\r\nAnsw. If his Majestie would please to intitle it to his Crowne, and\r\nyearely that both the Governours here and there may give their accounts to\r\nyou, or some that are not ingaged in the businesse, that the common stocke\r\n[IV.167.] bee not spent in maintaining one hundred men for the Governour,\r\none hundred for two Deputies, fifty for the Treasurer, five and twenty for\r\nthe Secretary, and more for the Marshall and other Officers who were never\r\nthere nor adventured any thing, but onely preferred by favour to be Lords\r\nover them that broke the ice and beat the path, and must teach them what\r\nto doe, if any thing happen well, it is their glory; if ill, the fault of\r\nthe old directors, that in all dangers must endure the worst, yet not five\r\nhundred of them have so much as one of the others; also that there bee\r\nsome present course taken to maintaine a Garrison to suppresse the\r\nSalvages, till they be able to subsist, and that his Majesty would please\r\nto remit his custome, or it is to be feared they will lose custome and\r\nall, for this cannot be done by promises, hopes, counsels and\r\ncountenances, but with sufficient workmen and meanes to maintaine them,\r\nnot such delinquents as here cannot be ruled by all the lawes in England,\r\nyet when the foundation is laid, as I have said, and a common-wealth\r\nestablished, then such there may better be constrained to labour then\r\nhere: but to rectifie a common-wealth with debaushed people is impossible,\r\nand no wise man would throw himselfe into such a society, that intends\r\nhonestly, and knowes what he undertakes, for there is no Countrey to\r\npillage as the Romans found: all you expect from thence must be by labour.\r\n\r\nFor the government I thinke there is as much adoe about it as the\r\nKingdomes of Scotland and Ireland, men here conceiting Virginia as they\r\nare, erecting as many stately Offices as Officers with their attendants,\r\nas there are labourers in the Countrey, where a Constable were as good as\r\ntwenty of their Captaines, and three hundred good Souldiers and labourers\r\nbetter then all the rest that goe onely to get the fruits of other mens\r\nlabours by the title of an office. Thus they spend Michaelmas rent in\r\nMid-summer Moone, and would gather their Harvest before they have planted\r\ntheir Corne.\r\n\r\nAs for the maintenance of the Officers, the first that went never demanded\r\nany, but adventured good summes, and it seemes strange to me, the fruits\r\nof all their labours, besides the expence of an hundred and fifty thousand\r\npounds, and such multitudes of people, those collaterall Officers could\r\nnot maintaine themselves so well as the old did, and having now such\r\nliberty to doe to the Salvages what they will, the others had not. I more\r\nthen wonder they have not five hundred Salvages to worke for them towards\r\ntheir generall maintenance, and as many more to returne some content and\r\nsatisfaction to the Adventurers, that for all their care, charge and\r\ndiligence, can heare nor see nothing but miserable complaints; therefore\r\nunder your correction to rectifie all, is with all expedition to passe the\r\nauthority to them who will releeve them, lest all bee consumed ere the\r\ndifferences be determined. And except his Majestie undertake it, or by\r\nAct of Parliament some small tax may be granted throughout his Dominions,\r\nas a Penny upon every Poll, called a head-penny; two pence upon every\r\nChimney, or some such collection might be raised, and that would be\r\nsufficient to give a good stocke, and many servants to sufficient men of\r\nany facultie, and transport them freely for paying onely homage to the\r\nCrowne of England, and such duties to the publike good as their estates\r\nincreased reason should require. Were this put in practice, how many\r\npeople of what quality you please, for all those disasters would yet\r\ngladly goe to spend their lives there, and by this meanes more good might\r\nbe done in one yeere, then all those pety particular undertakings will\r\neffect in twenty.\r\n\r\nFor the Patent the King may, if he please, rather take it from them that\r\nhave it, then from us who had it first, pretending to his Majesty what\r\ngreat matters they would doe, and how little we did, and for any thing I\r\ncan conceive, had we remained still as at first, it is not likely we could\r\nhave done much worse; but those oft altering of governments are not\r\nwithout much charge, hazard and losse. If I be too plaine, I humbly crave\r\nyour pardon; but you requested me, therefore I doe but my duty. For the\r\nNobility, who knowes not how freely both in [IV.168.] their Purses and\r\nassistances many of them have beene to advance it, committing the managing\r\nof the businesse to inferiour persons, amongst whom questionlesse also\r\nmany have done their utmost best, sincerely and truly according to their\r\nconceit, opinion and understanding; yet grosse errors have beene\r\ncommitted, but no man lives without his fault; for my owne part, I have\r\nso much adoe to amend my owne, I have no leisure to looke into any mans\r\nparticular, but those in generall I conceive to be true. And so I humbly\r\nrest\r\n\r\n                                          Yours to command, J. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ENQUIRY BY KING JAMES\r\n\r\n\r\n                        A.D. 1623.\r\n\r\n     _The King hath pleased to take into his consideration._\r\n\r\nThus those discords, not being to be compounded among themselves, nor yet\r\nby the extraordinary diligences, care and paines or the noble and right\r\nworthy Commissioners, Sir William Jones, Sir Nicholas Fortescue, Sir\r\nFrancis Goston, Sir Richard Sutton, Sir Henry Bourgchier and Sir William\r\nPit; a Corante was granted against Master Deputy Farrar, and 20. or 30.\r\nothers of that party to plead their causes before the right Honourable,\r\nthe Lords of his Majesties Privy Councell: now notwithstanding all the\r\nRelations, Examinations, and intercepting of all Letters whatsoever came\r\nfrom thence, yet it seemes they were so farre unsatisfied and desired\r\nto know the truth, as well for the preservation of the Colony, as to give\r\ncontent and doe all men right, they sent two Commissioners strictly to\r\nexamine the true estate of the Colony. Upon whose returne after mature\r\ndeliberation, it pleased his royall Majesty to suppresse the course of the\r\nCourt at Deputy Farrars, and that for the present ordering the affaires of\r\nVirginia, untill he should make a more full settlement thereof, the Lord\r\nViscount Mandevile, Lord President of his Majesties Privie Councell, and\r\nalso other Privy Councellors, with many understanding Knights and\r\nGentlemen, should every Thursday in the afternoone meet at Sir Thomas\r\nSmiths in Philpot lane, where all men whom it should concerne may repaire,\r\nto receive such directions and warrant for their better security, as more\r\nat large you may see in the Proclamation to that effect, under the great\r\nSeale of England, dated the 15. of July, 1624. But as for the relations\r\nlast returned, what numbers they are, how many Cities, Corporations,\r\ntownes, and houses, cattle and horse they have, what fortifications or\r\ndiscoveries they have made, or revenge upon the Salvages; who are their\r\nfriends or foes, or what commodities they have more then Tobacco, & their\r\npresent estate or what is presently to be put in execution, in that the\r\nCommissioners are not yet fully satisfied in the one, nor resolved in the\r\nother, at this present time when this went to the Presse, I must intreat\r\nyou pardon me till I be better assured.\r\n\r\nThus far I have travelled in this Wildernesse of Virginia, not being\r\nignorant for all my paines this discourse will be wrested, tossed and\r\nturned as many waies as there is leaves; that I have writ too much of\r\nsome, too little of others, and many such like objections. To such I must\r\nanswer, in the Companies name I was requested to doe it, if any have\r\nconcealed their approved experiences from my knowledge, they must excuse\r\nme: as for every fatherles or stolne relation, or whole volumes of\r\nsofisticated rehearsals, I leave them to the charge of them that desire\r\nthem. I thanke God I never under-tooke any thing yet any could tax me of\r\ncarelesnesse or dishonesty, and what is hee to whom I am indebted or\r\ntroublesome? Ah! were these my accusers but to change cases and places\r\nwith me but 2. yeeres, or till they had done but so much as I, it may be\r\nthey would judge more charitably of my imperfections. But here I must\r\nleave all to the triall of time, both my selfe, Virginia's preparations,\r\nproceedings and good events, praying to that great God the protector of\r\nall goodnesse to send them as good successe as the goodnesse of the action\r\nand Country deserveth, and my heart desireth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                FINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              A.D. 1623.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE FIFTH BOOKE. [V.169.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     The Generall Historie\r\n            of the Bermudas, now called the Summer Iles,\r\n             from their beginning in the yeere of our\r\n                 Lord 1593. to this present 1624.\r\n                      with their proceedings,\r\n                       accidents and present\r\n                             estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _The description of the Iles._\r\n\r\nBefore we present you the matters of fact, it is fit to offer to your\r\nview the Stage whereon they were acted, for as Geography without History\r\nseemeth a carkasse without motion, so History without Geography, wandreth\r\nas a Vagrant without a certaine habitation. Those Ilands lie in the huge\r\nmaine Ocean, and two hundred leagues from any continent, situated in 32.\r\ndegrees and 25. minutes, of Northerly latitude, and distant from England\r\nWest South-West, about 3300. miles, some twenty miles in length, and not\r\npast two miles and a halfe in breadth, environed with Rocks, which to the\r\nNorth-ward, West-ward, and South-East, extend further then they have bin\r\nyet well discovered: by reason of those Rocks the Country is naturally\r\nvery strong, for there is but two places, & scarce two, unlesse to them\r\nwho know them well, where shipping may safely come in, and those now are\r\nexceeding well fortified, but within is roome to entertaine a royall\r\nFleet: the Rocks in most places appeare at a low water, neither are they\r\nmuch covered at a high, for it ebbs and flowes not past five foot; the\r\nshore for most part is a Rocke, so hardened with the sunne, wind and sea,\r\nthat it is not apt to be worne away with the waves, whose violence is also\r\nbroke by the Rocks before they can come to the shore: it is very uneven,\r\ndistributed into hills and dales; the mold is of divers colours, neither\r\nclay nor sand, but a meane betweene; the red which resembleth clay is the\r\nworst, the whitest resembling sand and the blackest is good, but the\r\nbrowne betwixt them both which they call white, because there is mingled\r\nwith it a white meale is the best: under the mould two or three foot deep,\r\nand sometimes lesse, is a kinde of white hard substance which they call\r\nthe Rocke: the trees usually fasten their roots in it; neither is it\r\nindeed rocke or stone, or so hard, though for most part more harder then\r\nChalke; nor so white, but pumish-like and spungy, easily receiving and\r\ncontaining much water. In some places Clay is found under it, it seemes to\r\nbe ingendred with raine water, draining through the earth, and drawing\r\nwith it of his substance unto a certaine depth where it congeales; the\r\nhardest kinde of it lies under the red ground like quarries, as it were\r\nthicke slates one upon another, through which the water hath his passage,\r\nso that in such places there is scarce found any fresh water, for all or\r\nthe most part of the fresh water commeth out of the Sea draining through\r\nthe sand, or that substance called the Rocke, leaving the salt behinde, it\r\nbecomes fresh: sometimes we digged wells of fresh water which we finde in\r\nmost places, and but three or foure paces from the Sea side, some further,\r\nthe most part of them would ebbe and flow as the Sea did, and be levell or\r\nlittle higher then the superficies of the sea, and in some places very\r\nstrange, darke and cumbersome Caves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    CLIMATE OF THE ISLANDS\r\n\r\n                         A.D. 1623.\r\n\r\n\r\n             _The clime, temper and fertility._\r\n\r\nThe aire is most commonly cleere, very temperate, [V.170.] moist, with a\r\nmoderate heat, very healthfull and apt for the generation and nourishing\r\nof all things, so as many things transported from hence yeeld a farre\r\ngreater increase, and if it be any living thing it becomes fatter and\r\nbetter; by this meanes the country is so replenished with Hens and\r\nTurkies, within the space of three or foure yeeres, that many of them\r\nbeing neglected, forsake the houses and become wilde, and so live in\r\ngreat abundance; the like increase there is in Hogs, tame Conies, and\r\nother Cattle according to their kindes. There seemes to be a continuall\r\nSpring, which is the cause some things come not to that maturity and\r\nperfection as were requisite; and though the trees shed their leaves, yet\r\nthey are alwaies full of greene; the Corne is the same they have in\r\nVirginia, and the West-Indies: of this and many other things without\r\nplowing or much labour, they have two Harvests every yeere, for they set\r\nabout March, which they gather in July; and againe in August, which they\r\nreape in December; and little slips of Fig-trees and Vines doe usually\r\nbeare fruit within the yeere, and sometimes in lesse; but we finde not the\r\nGrapes as yet come to any perfection; the like fertility it hath in\r\nOranges and Limons, Pomgranates, and other things. Concerning the serenity\r\nand beauty of the skie, it may as truly be said of those Ilands as ever it\r\nwas said of the Rhodes, that there is no one day throughout the 12.\r\nmoneths, but that in some houre thereof, the sun lookes singularly &\r\ncleere upon them: for the temperature it is beyond all others most\r\nadmirable; no cold there is beyond an English Aprill, nor heat much\r\ngreater then an ordinary July in France, so that frost and snow is never\r\nseene here, nor stinking and infectious mists very seldome, by reason of\r\nthe maine Ocean, there is some wind stirring that cooles the aire: the\r\nwinter they have observes the time with ours, but the longest daies and\r\nnights are shorter then ours almost by two houres.\r\n\r\n                       _Trees and Fruits._\r\n\r\n                   _The Prickell Peare._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                    _The Poison weed._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\n                      _The red weed._ {MN-3}\r\n\r\nWe found it at first all overgrowne with weeds, and plants of severall\r\nkinds, as many tall and goodly Cedars, infinite store of Palmetoes,\r\nnumbers of Mulberies, wild Olive-trees store, with divers others unknowne\r\nboth by name and nature, so that as yet they become lost to many usefull\r\nimployments, which time and industry no doubt will one day discover, and\r\neven already certaine of the most notorious of them have gotten them\r\nappellations from their apparent effects, {MN-1} as the Prickell-peare\r\nwhich growes like a shrub by the ground, with broad thick leaves, all\r\nover-armed with long and sharpe dangerous thornes, the fruit being in\r\nforme not much unlike a small greene Peare, and on the outside of the\r\nsame colour, but within bloud red, and exceeding full of juice; with\r\ngraines not much unlike the Pomgranat, and colouring after its nature.\r\n{MN-2} The poysoned weed is much in shape like our English Ivy, but being\r\nbut touched, causeth rednesse, itching, and lastly blisters, the which\r\nhowsoever after a while passe away of themselves without further harme,\r\nyet because for the time they are somewhat pain-full, it hath got it\r\nselfe an ill name, although questionlesse of no ill nature. {MN-3} Here is\r\nalso frequently growing a certaine tall Plant, whose stalke being all over\r\ncovered with a red rinde, is thereupon termed the red weed, the root\r\nwhereof being soked in any liquor, or but a small quantity of the Juice\r\ndrunke alone, procures a very forcible vomit, and yet is generally used by\r\nthe people, and found very effectuall against the paines and distempers\r\nof the stomacke.\r\n\r\n                    _The purging Beane._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n                    _The costive tree._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\n                     _Red Pepper._ {MN-3}\r\n\r\n                    _The Sea Feather._ {MN-4}\r\n\r\n                  _Fruits transported._ {MN-5}\r\n\r\n{MN-1} A kinde of Wood-bind there is likewise by the Sea very commonly to\r\nbee found, which runnes upon trees twining it selfe like a Vine: the fruit\r\nsomewhat resembles a Beane, but somewhat flatter, the which any way eaten\r\nworketh excellently in the nature of a purge, and though very vehemently,\r\nyet without all perill. {MN-2} Contrary to this, another small tree there\r\nis, which causeth costivenesse; there is also a certaine Plant like a\r\nbramble bush, which beares a long yellow fruit, having the shell very\r\nhard, and within it a hard berry, that beaten and taken inwardly purgeth\r\ngently. {MN-3} There is another fruit much like our Barberies, which being\r\nbeaten or brused betweene the teeth, sets all the mouth on an extreme heat\r\nvery terrible for the time, to avoid which they are swallowed downe whole,\r\nand found of the same or better operation then [V.171.] the red Pepper,\r\nand thence borroweth the name. {MN-4} In the bottome of the Sea there is\r\ngrowing upon the Rocks a large kinde of Plant in the forme of a Vine\r\nleafe, but far more spread with veines in colour of a pale red, very\r\nstrangely interlaced & woven one into another, which we call the Feather,\r\nbut the vertue thereof is altogether unknowne, but only regarded for the\r\nrarity. Now besides these naturall productions, providences & paines\r\nsince the Plantation, have offered divers other seeds & plants, which the\r\nsoile hath greedily imbraced & cherished, {MN-5} so that at this present\r\n1623. there are great abundance of white, red and yellow coloured\r\nPotatoes, Tobacco, Sugar-canes, Indicos, Parsnips, exceeding large\r\nRadishes, the American bread, the Cassado root, the Indian Pumpian, the\r\nWater-millon, Musk-millon, & the most delicate Pine-apples, Plantans, and\r\nPapawes, also the English Artichoke, Pease, &c. briefly whatsoever else\r\nmay be expected for the satisfaction either of curiosity, necessity or\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n                           _Birds._\r\n\r\n                      _Egge-birds._ {MN}\r\n\r\nNeither hath the aire for her part been wanting with due supplies of many\r\nsorts of Fowles, as the gray and white Hearne, the gray and greene Plover,\r\nsome wilde Ducks and Malards, Coots and Red-shankes, Sea-wigions,\r\nGray-bitterns, Cormorants, numbers of small Birds like Sparrowes and\r\nRobins, which have lately beene destroyed by the wilde Cats, Wood-pickars,\r\nvery many Crowes, which since this Plantation are kild, the rest fled or\r\nseldome scene except in the most uninhabited places, from whence they are\r\nobserved to take their flight about sun set, directing their course\r\ntowards the North-west, which makes many conjecture there are some more\r\nIlands not far off that way. Sometimes are also seene Falcons &\r\nJar-falcons, Ospraies, a Bird like a Hobby, but because they come seldome,\r\nthey are held but as passengers; but above all these, most deserving\r\nobservation and respect are those two sorts of Birds, the one for the tune\r\nof his voice, the other for the effect, called the Cahow, {MN} and\r\nEgge-bird, which on the first of May, a day constantly observed, fall a\r\nlaying infinite store of Eggs neere as big as Hens, upon certaine small\r\nsandie baies especially in Coupers Ile; and although men sit downe amongst\r\nthem when hundreds have bin gathered in a morning, yet there it hath\r\nstayed amongst them till they have gathered as many more: they continue\r\nthis course till Midsummer, and so tame & feareles, you must thrust them\r\noff from their Eggs with your hand; then they grow so faint with laying,\r\nthey suffer them to breed & take infinite numbers of their yong to eat,\r\nwhich are very excellent meat.\r\n\r\n                        _Cahowes._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n     _The Tropicke Bird and the Pemblicos presagements._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\n{MN-1} The Cahow is a bird of the night, for all the day she lies hid in\r\nholes in the Rocks, where they and their young are also taken with as much\r\nease as may be, but in the night if you but whoop and hollow, they will\r\nlight upon you, that with your hands you may chuse the fat and leave the\r\nleane; those they have only in winter: their Eggs are as big as hens, but\r\nthey are speckled, the other white. Mr. Norwood hath taken twenty dozen of\r\nthem in three or foure houres, and since there hath beene such havocke\r\nmade of them, they were neere all destroyed, till there was a strict\r\ninhibition for their preservation. {MN-2} The Tropicke bird is white, as\r\nlarge as a Pullet, with one onely long Feather in her taile, and is\r\nseldome seene far distant from other of the Tropicks: another small Bird\r\nthere is, because she cries Pemblyco they call her so, she is seldome\r\nseene in the day but when she sings, as too oft she doth very clamorously;\r\ntoo true a Prophet she proves of huge winds and boysterous weather: there\r\nwere a kinde of small Owles in great abundance, but they are now all\r\nslaine or fled: some tame Ducks, Geese and Pigeons there are, but the two\r\nlatter prosper not.\r\n\r\n                           _Of Vermine._\r\n\r\n                           _Note._ {MN}\r\n\r\nConcerning vermine and noisome creatures, there are not many, but onely\r\nRats and Cats, there increased since the Plantation, but how they agree\r\ntogether you shall heare hereafter. The Musketas and Flies are also too\r\nbusie, with a certaine India Bug, called by the Spaniards a Cacarootch,\r\nthe which creeping into Chests they eat and defile with their ill-sented\r\ndung: also the little Ants in summer time are so troublesome, they are\r\nforced to dry their figs upon high frames, and anoint their feet with tar,\r\nwherein they sticke, else they would spoile them all ere [V.172.] they\r\ncould be dryed: Wormes in the earth also there are, but too many, so that\r\nto keepe them from destroying their Corne and Tobacco, they are forced to\r\nworme them every morning, which is a great labour, else all would be\r\ndestroyed. Lizards there were many and very large, but now none, and it is\r\nsaid they were destroyed by the Cat. {MN} Certaine Spiders also of very\r\nlarge size are found hanging upon trees, but instead of being any way\r\ndangerous as in other places, they are here of a most pleasing aspect,\r\nall over drest, as it were with Silver, Gold, and Pearle, and their Webs\r\nin the Summer woven from tree to tree, are generally a perfect raw silke,\r\nand that as well in regard of substance as colour, and so strong withall,\r\nthat divers Birds bigger than Black-birds, being like Snipes, are often\r\ntaken and snared in them as a Net: then what would the Silke-worme doe\r\nwere shee there to feede upon the continuall greene Mulbery?\r\n\r\n                                _Fishes._\r\n\r\n                _The most hurtfull things in those Iles._ {MN}\r\n\r\nBut above all the rest of the Elements, the Sea is found most abundantly\r\nliberall: hence have they as much excellent Fish, and as much variety as\r\nneed be desired. The most of which being unknowne to our Northerne parts,\r\ngot there new names, either for their shapes or conditions; as the large\r\nRocke-fish from his like hew, and haunting amongst the Rocks, the fat\r\nHog-fish from his swinelike shape and snout: for this is not the old\r\nknowne Hog-fish with brussels on his backe; the delicate Amber-fish from\r\nhis taste and smell, Angell-fish, Cony-fish, the small yellow taile from\r\nthat naturall painting; the great Growper from his odde and strange\r\ngrunting, some of them yet knowne to the Americans, as the Purgoose, the\r\nCavallo, the Gar-fish, Flying-fish and Morerayes: the rest are common to\r\nother Continents; as the Whale in great numbers, the Sharke, the\r\nPilot-fish, the Sea-Breame, the Oyster and Lobster, with divers others;\r\ntwenty Tortoises have beene taken in a day, and some of them will affoord\r\nhalfe a bushell of Egges, and suffice to feed forty men at a meale. And\r\nthus have you briefely epitomized Mother Natures benefits to this little,\r\nyet danty spot of earth, neither were it ingenuity to conceale wherein\r\nshee inclineth to the Stepdame, especially since the particulars are so\r\nfew, as rather requisite Antidotes against idlenesse to rouse up industry,\r\nthen any great cause of much distaste, much lesse despaire: {MN} and of\r\nthose to speake troth, there are onely two: viz. the Winds, and the\r\nWormes, especially in the Spring and Autumne; and thus conditioned as yet\r\nwe will let rest these small Ilands, in the midst of this mightie and\r\nmaine Ocean, so invironed on every side, by infinite numbers of\r\nuncertaine scattered Rocks, lying shallowly hid under the surface of the\r\nwater, a league, two, three, foure, or five, to Sea, to the which\r\nadvantages added by art, as hereafter you shall heare at large, and\r\nfinde described in the Map. It may well be concluded to be the most\r\nimpregnable place in the world, and although the Amber Greece, Pearles,\r\nnor Tobacco, are of that quantity and certainty to be relied upon to\r\ngaine wealth; yet by practise and experience they finde, by Silke,\r\nSaffron, Indico, Madar, Sugar-canes, Wine, Oile, and such like great\r\nprofit may be expected: yet were those hopelesse in regard of their\r\nconveniency to nourish and maintaine themselves, and releeve them shall\r\nvisit them with wood, water, and other necessaries, besides what an\r\neye-sore they are already becommed to them that have them not, and how\r\ndeare and pretious to them that have them, I thinke none will deny but\r\nthey are well worth the keeping: and so we will proceed to the accidents\r\nthat befell the first finders; also the proceedings of the first Planters\r\nand their successors, Master Norrod, Thomas Sparkes, and divers others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            A.D. 1593.\r\n\r\n\r\n              A briefe relation of the shipwracke of\r\n                             Henry May.\r\n\r\n\r\n          _How it is supposed they were called the Bermudas._\r\n\r\nHow these Iles came by the name of Bermudas, or the infinite number of\r\nblacke Hogs, or so fearefull to the world, that many called them the Ile\r\nof Devils, that all men did shun as Hell and perdition; I will not\r\nexpostulate, nor trouble your patiences with those uncertaine antiquities\r\nfurther then thus; our men found [V.173.] divers crosses, peeces of\r\nSpanish monies here and there. Two or three wracks also they found, by\r\ncertaine inscriptions to bee some Spanish, some Dutch, some French; but\r\nthe greatest rumour is, that a Spanish ship called Bermudas was there cast\r\naway, carrying Hogges to the West-Indies that swam a shore, and there\r\nincreased: how the Spaniards escaped is uncertaine: but they say, from\r\nthat ship those Iles were first called Bermudas, which till then for six\r\nthousand yeares had beene namelesse.\r\n\r\nBut the first English-man that was ever in them, was one Henry May, a\r\nworthy Mariner that went with Captaine Lancaster to the East-Indies 1591.\r\nand in their returne by the West-Indies, being in some distresse, sent\r\nthis Henry May for England by one Mounsier de la Barbotier, to acquaint\r\nthe Merchants with their estate. The last of November, saith May, we\r\ndeparted from Laguna in Hispaniola, and the seventeenth of December\r\nfollowing, we were cast away upon the North-west of the Bermudas; the\r\nPilots about noone made themselves Southwards of the Iles twelve leagues,\r\nand demanded of the Captaine their Wine of hight as out of all danger,\r\nwhich they had: but it seemes they were either drunke, or carelesse of\r\ntheir charge; for through their negligences a number of good men were\r\ncast away. I being but a stranger amongst fiftie and odde French-men, it\r\npleased God to appoint me to be one of them should be saved. In this\r\nextremity we made a raft, which we towed with our Boat, there were but six\r\nand twentie of us saved; and I seeing scarce roome for the one halfe,\r\ndurst not passe in amongst them till the Captaine called me along with\r\nhim, leaving the better halfe to the seas mercy: that day we rowed till\r\nwithin two houres of night ere we could land, being neere dead with\r\nthirst, every man tooke his way to seeke fresh water, at length, by\r\nsearching amongst many weeds, we found some raine water, but in the maine\r\nare many faire Baies, where we had enough for digging.\r\n\r\n             _The building and calking their Barke._\r\n\r\nNow it pleased God before our ship split we saved our Carpenters tooles,\r\nsome Nailes, Sailes, and Tacklings, wherewith we went roundly to worke,\r\nand built a Barke of eighty tunnes: In stead of Pitch, we made Lime, mixed\r\nwith Tortoise oyle, and as the Carpenters calked her, I and another paied\r\nthe seames with this plaster, which being in Aprill, became quickly dry,\r\nand as hard as a stone.\r\n\r\n                  _His returne for England._\r\n\r\nIn Aprill it was so hot, we feared our water would faile, two great Chests\r\nwee made which we calked as our ship; those we stowed on each side our\r\nmaine Mast, filled them with water and thirtie live Tortoises: wee found\r\nmany Hogges, but so leane wee could not eat them; the tops of the\r\nPalmetaberries was our bread, and the juyce we got out of the trees we cut\r\ndowne our drinke, and of the leaves, which are more then an Ell long, we\r\ncovered our Cabens, & made our beds, and found many of those provisions as\r\nis related, but little foule weather. The eleventh of May it pleased God\r\nto set us cleere of the Ile, after wee had lived there five moneths: and\r\nthe twentieth wee fell with Cape Britton, neere New found Land, where\r\nrefreshing our selves with wood and water, and such things as we could get\r\nof the Salvages, it seemed a good Countrey, but we staied not past foure\r\nhoures before we set saile for the banke of New found land, where wee met\r\nmany ships, but not any would take in a man of us, untill it pleased God\r\nwe met a Barke of Fawmothe, which received us for a little time, and with\r\nher we tooke a French ship, wherein I left Captaine de la Barbotier, my\r\ndeare friend, and all his Company: and in August arrived at Falmouth in\r\nthis honest English Barke, 1594.\r\n\r\n                                         Written by me Henry May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SIR GEORGE SOMERS\r\n                          AD. 1609.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The 6 first English ship knowne to have beene cast [V.174.]\r\n    away upon the Bermudas 1609. From the relation of Mr. Jordan,\r\n    Master John Evens, Master Henry Shelly, and divers others.\r\n\r\n\r\n           _A most desperate estate by a storm._ {MN}\r\n\r\nYou have heard, that when Captaine Smith was Governor of Virginia, there\r\nwere nine ships sent with Sir Thomas Gates, and Sir George Somers, and\r\nCaptaine Nuport with five hundred people, to take in the old Commission,\r\nand rectifie a new government: they set saile in May, and in the height of\r\nthirty degrees of Northerly latitude, {MN} they were taken with an extreme\r\nstorme, or rather a part of Hericano, upon the five and twentieth of July,\r\nwhich as they write, did not onely separate them from the Fleet, but with\r\nthe violent working of the Seas, their ship became so shaken, torne, and\r\nleake, she received so much water as covered two tire of Hogs-heads above\r\nthe ballace, that they stood up to the middles, with Buckets, Baricos, and\r\nKettles, to baile out the water. Thus bailing and pumping three daies and\r\nthree nights without intermission, and yet the water seemed rather to\r\nincrease then diminish, in so much that being all utterly spent with\r\nlabour, were even resolved without any hope to shut up the hatches, and\r\ncommit themselves to the mercy of the Sea, which is said to be mercilesse,\r\nor rather to the mercy of Almighty God, whose mercy farre exceeds all his\r\nworkes; seeing no sense or hope in mans apprehension, but presently to\r\nsinke: some having some good and comfortable waters, fetched them and\r\ndranke one to another, as taking their last leaves untill a more happy,\r\nand a more joyfull meeting in a more blessed world, when it pleased God\r\nout of his most gracious and mercifull providence, so to direct and guide\r\ntheir ship for her most advantage.\r\n\r\n            _The care and judgements of Sir George Somers._\r\n\r\n                _An evident token of Gods mercy._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThat Sir George Somers all this time sitting upon the poupe, scarce taking\r\nleisure to eat nor sleepe, coving the ship to keepe her as upright as he\r\ncould, otherwaies she must long ere that needs have foundered, most\r\nwishedly and happily descried land; whereupon he most comfortably\r\nincouraged them to follow their worke, many of them being fast asleepe:\r\nthis unlocked for welcome newes, as if it had bin a voice from heaven,\r\nhurrieth them all above hatches, to looke for that they durst scarce\r\nbeleeve, so that improvidently forsaking that taske which imported no\r\nlesse then their lives, they gave so dangerous advantage to their greedy\r\nenemy the salt water, which still entred at the large breaches of their\r\npoore wooden castle, as that in gaping after life, they had well-nigh\r\nswallowed their death. Surely it is impossible any should now be urged to\r\ndoe his best, and although they knew it, that place all men did so shun,\r\nyet they spread all the saile they could to attaine them: {MN} for not\r\nlong it was before they strucke upon a rocke, till a surge of the sea cast\r\nher from thence, and so from one to another, till most luckily at last so\r\nupright betwixt two, as if she had beene in the stocks, till this they\r\nexpected but every blow a death: But now behold, suddenly the wind gives\r\nplace to a calme, and the billowes, which each by overtaking her, would\r\nin an instant have shivered her in peeces, become peaceable and still, so\r\nthat with all conveniency and ease, they unshipped all their goods,\r\nvictuall, and persons into their Boats, and with extreme joy, even almost\r\nto amazednesse, arrived in safetie, though more then a league from the\r\nshore, without the losse of a man; yet were they in all one hundred and\r\nfiftie: yet their deliverance was not more strange in falling so happily\r\nupon the land, as their feeding and preservation was beyond their hopes;\r\nfor you have heard, it hath beene to the Spaniards more fearefull then an\r\nUtopian Purgatory, and to all Sea-men no lesse terrible then an inchanted\r\nden of Furies and Devils, the most dangerous, unfortunate, and forlorne\r\nplace in the world, and they found it the richest, healthfullest and\r\npleasantest they ever saw, as is formerly said.\r\n\r\n             _Sir George Somers his first ranging the land._\r\n\r\nBeing thus safe on shore, they disposed themselves to [V.175.] search the\r\nIles for food and water; others to get a shore what they could from the\r\nship; not long Sir George wandred but found such a fishing, that in halfe\r\nan houre with a hooke and line, he tooke so many as sufficed the whole\r\ncompany, in some places they were so thicke in the Coves, and so great,\r\nthey durst not goe in lest they should bite them, and these rocke fish are\r\nso great two will load a man, and fatter nor better fish cannot be. Mr.\r\nShelly found a Bay neere a quarter of a mile over, so full of Mullets, as\r\nnone of them before had ever seene or heard of the like: the next day\r\nseeking to kill them with fis-gigs, they strucke so many the water in many\r\nplaces was red with bloud, yet caught not one, but with a net they caught\r\nso many as they could draw a shore, with infinite number of Pilchards and\r\ndivers other sorts; great craw-fishes in a night by making a fire they\r\nhave taken in great quantity. Sir George had twice his hooke and line\r\nbroke out of his hand, but the third time he made it so strong he caught\r\nthe same fish, which had pulled him into the Sea had not his men got hold\r\nof him, whereby he had his three hookes againe were found in her belly.\r\nAt their first hunting for hogs they found such abundance, they killed 32\r\nand this hunting & fishing was appointed to Captaine Robert Walsingham,\r\nand Mr. Henry Shelly for the company in general: they report they killed\r\nat least 500. besides Pigs, and many that were killed by divers others;\r\nfor the birds in their seasons, the facility to make their cabens of\r\nPalmeta leaves, caused many of them utterly forget or desire ever to\r\nreturne from thence, they lived in such plenty, peace and ease.\r\n\r\n             _What meanes they made to send to Virginia._\r\n\r\nBut let us remember how the Knights began to resolve in those desperat\r\naffaires: many projects they had, but at last it was concluded, to decke\r\ntheir long boat with their ship hatches; which done, with all expedition\r\nthey sent Master Raven, a very sufficient Mariner, with eight more in her\r\nto Virginia, to have shipping from thence to fetch them away; three weekes\r\nor a moneth they expected her returne, but to this day she was never more\r\nheard of; all this time was spent in searching the Iles: now although God\r\nstill fed them with this abundance of plenty, yet such was the malice of\r\nenvy or ambition, for all this good service done by Sommers, such a great\r\ndifference fell amongst their Commanders, that they lived asunder in this\r\ndistresse, rather as meere strangers then distressed friends: but\r\nnecessity so commanded, patience had the victory.\r\n\r\n                _A mariage and two children borne._\r\n\r\nTwo ships at this time by those severall parties were a building; in the\r\nmeane time two children were borne, the Boy was called Bermudas, the Girle\r\nBermuda, and amongst all those sorrowes they had a merry English mariage;\r\nthe forme of those Iles you may see at large in the Map of Mr. Norwood,\r\nwhere you may plainly see no place knowne hath better walls, nor a broader\r\nditch. But having finished and rigged their two new Cedar ships with such\r\nprovisions they saved from the Sea-adventurer they left amongst the Rocks,\r\nthey called the one the Patience, the other the Deliverance; they used\r\nLime and Oile, as May did for Pitch and Tar. Sir George Summers had in his\r\nBarke no Iron at all but one bolt in her Keele; now having made their\r\nprovisions of victuall and all things ready, they set saile the tenth of\r\nMay 1610. onely leaving two men behinde them, called Christopher Carter\r\nand Edward Waters, that for their offences, or the suspition they had of\r\ntheir judgements, fled into the woods, and there rather desired to end\r\ntheir daies then stand to their trials and the event of Justice; for one\r\nof their consorts was shot to death, and Waters being tied to a tree also\r\nto be executed, had by chance a Knife about him, and so secretly cut the\r\nRope, he ran into the woods where they could not finde him. There were two\r\nSalvages also sent from Virginia by Captain Smith, the one called\r\nNamuntack, the other Matchumps, but some such differences fell betweene\r\nthem, that Matchumps slew Namuntack, and having made a hole to bury him,\r\nbecause it was too short, he cut of his legs and laid them by him, which\r\nmurder he concealed till he was in Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           A.D. 1610\r\n                 _Their arrivall in Virginia._\r\n\r\nThe foure and twentieth of the same moneth they arrived in Virginia at\r\nJames towne, where they found but threescore persons, as you may reade at\r\nlarge in the History of Virginia, of the five hundred left by Captaine\r\nSmith, also of the arrivall of the Lord Laware, that met [V.176.] them\r\nthus bound for England, returned them backe, and understanding what plenty\r\nthere was of hogs and other good things in the Bermudas, was desirous to\r\nsend thither to supply his necessary occasions; whereupon Sir George\r\nSummers, the best acquainted with the place, whose noble minde ever\r\nregarded a generall good more then his owne ends, though above threescore\r\nyeeres of age, and had meanes in England sutable to his ranke, offered\r\nhimselfe by Gods helpe to performe this dangerous voyage againe for the\r\nBermudas, which was kindly accepted, so upon the 19. of June, he imbarked\r\nin his Cedar ship, about the burthen of thirty tunnes, and so set saile.\r\n\r\n              _Sir George Somers his return to the Bermudas._\r\n\r\nMuch foule and crosse weather he had, and was forced to the North parts of\r\nVirginia, where refreshing himselfe upon this unknowne coast, he could not\r\nbee diverted from the search of the Bermudas, where at last with his\r\ncompany he safely arrived: but such was his diligence with his\r\nextraordinary care, paines and industry to dispatch his businesse, and the\r\nstrength of his body not answering the ever memorable courage of his\r\nminde, having lived so long in such honourable services, the most part of\r\nhis well beloved and vertuous life, God and nature here determined, should\r\never remaine a perpetuall memory of his much bewailed sorrow for his\r\ndeath: finding his time but short, after he had taken the best course he\r\ncould to settle his estate, like a valiant Captaine he exhorted them with\r\nall diligence to be constant to those Plantations, and with all expedition\r\nto returne to Virginia. In that very place which we now call Saint Georges\r\ntowne, this noble Knight died, whereof the place taketh the name. But his\r\nmen, as men amazed, seeing the death of him who was even as the life of\r\nthem all, embalmed his body and set saile for England, being the first\r\nthat ever went to seeke those Ilands, which have beene ever since called\r\nSummers Iles, in honour of his worthy memory, leaving three men behind\r\nthem, that voluntarily stayed, whose names were Christopher Carter, Edward\r\nWaters, there formerly left as is said, and Edward Chard. This Cedar ship\r\nat last with his dead body arrived at Whit-Church in Dorsetshire, where by\r\nhis friends he was honourably buried, with many vollies of shot, and the\r\nrites of a Souldier, and upon his tombe was bestowed this Epitaph.\r\n\r\n                        _His Epitaph._\r\n\r\n    Hei mihi Virginia quod tam cito praeterit AEstas,\r\n    Autumnus sequitur, saeviet inde & hiems;\r\n    At ver perpetuum nascetur, & Anglia laeta,\r\n    Decerpit flores florida terra tuas.\r\n\r\n                        In English thus:\r\n\r\n    Alas Virginia's Summer so soone past,\r\n    Autumne succeeds and stormy Winters blast,\r\n    Yet Englands joyfull Spring with joyfull showers,\r\n    O Florida, shall bring thy sweetest flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n               _The proceedings of the three  men._\r\n\r\n      _A peece of Amber-greece of_ 80. _pound weight._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThe honour of this resulution belongs principally to Carter, for through\r\nhis importunity, not to leave such a place abandoned, Chard & Waters were\r\nmoved to stay with him, and the rest promised with all the speed they\r\ncould againe to revisit them. But the ship once out of sight, those three\r\nLords, the sole inhabitants of all those Ilands, began to erect their\r\nlittle common wealth for a while with brotherly regency, repairing the\r\nground, planting Corne, and such seeds and fruits as they had, building a\r\nhouse, &c. Then making privy search amongst the crevises and corners of\r\nthose craggy Rocks, what this maine Ocean since the worlds creation had\r\nthrowne amongst them, {MN} at last they chanced upon the greatest peece of\r\nAmber-greece was ever seene or heard or in one lumpe, being in weight\r\nfourescore pound, besides divers other small Peeces.\r\n\r\nBut now being rich, they grew so proud and ambitious, [V.177.] contempt\r\ntooke such place, they fell out for superiority, though but three forlorne\r\nmen, more then three thousand miles from their native Country, and but\r\nsmall hope ever to see it againe. Notwithstanding, they sometimes fell\r\nfrom words to blowes about meere trifles: in one of which fights, one of\r\nthem was bitten with his owne dog, as if the dumbe beast would reprove\r\nthem of their folly; at last Chard and Waters, the two greater spirits,\r\nmust try it out in the field, but Carter wisely stole away their weapons,\r\naffecting rather to live amongst his enemies, then by being rid of them\r\nlive alone; and thus those miserable men lived full two yeeres, so that\r\nall their clothes were neere worne cleane from their backs, and their\r\nhopes of any forraine releefe as naked as their bodies. At last they began\r\nto recover their wits, yet in a fashion perhaps would have cost them\r\ndearer then when they were mad; for concluding a tripartite peace of their\r\nMatachin warre, they resolved to frame as good a Boat as they could, and\r\ntherein to make a desperate attempt for Virginia, or New found Land; but\r\nno sooner were they entred into that resolution, but they descried a saile\r\nstanding in for the shore, though they neither knew what she was, nor what\r\nshe would, they were so over-joyed, with all possible speed they went to\r\nmeet her, and according to their hearts desire she proved an English-man,\r\nwhom they safely conducted into their harbour.\r\n\r\n                               A.D. 1611\r\n                       _How they were supplied._\r\n\r\nNow you are to understand, that Captaine Matthew Somers, Nephew and heire\r\nto Sir George, that returned with his dead body, though both he and his\r\nCompany did their utmost in relating all those passages to their\r\nCountrey-men and adventurers, their relations were beleeved but as\r\ntravellers tales, till it came to be apprehended by some of the Virginia\r\nCompany, how beneficiall it might be, and helpfull to the Plantation in\r\nVirginia, so that some one hundred and twentie of them bought the\r\npretended right of all the Company, and had sent this ship to make a\r\ntriall; but first they had obtained Letters Patents of the Kings most\r\nexcellent Majestie. Sir Thomas Smith was elected Treasurer and Governor\r\nheere, and Master Richard More to be Governor of the Iles and Colony\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            A.D. 1612.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The first beginning of a Colonie in the Somer Iles, under the command\r\n    of Master Richard More, extracted out of a plot of Master Richard\r\n    Norwood Surveior, and the relations of divers others.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                1612.\r\n                   _Sir Thomas Smith Treasurer._\r\n\r\n                   _The arrivall of Master More._\r\n\r\nMaster More thus finding those three men not onely well and lusty, but\r\nwell stored with divers sorts of provisions, as an Acre of Corne ready to\r\nbe gathered, numbers of Pumpions and Indian Beanes, many Tortoises ready\r\ntaken, good store of hogs flesh salted, and made in flitches of Bacon,\r\nwere very good, and so presently landed his goods and sixty persons\r\ntowards the beginning of July 1612. upon the South side of Smiths Ile.\r\n\r\n            _Their differences about the Amber-greece._\r\n\r\nNot long after his arrivall, More having some private intelligence of this\r\nAmber-greece, tooke first Chard in examination, he being one of the three\r\nthe most masterfull spirit, what Amber-greece, Pearle, Treasure, or other\r\nCommodities they had found. Chard no lesse witty then resolute, directly\r\nanswered; Not any thing at all but the fruits of the Ile, what his\r\nfellowes had done he knew not, but if they had, he doubted not but to\r\nfinde it out, and then hee should know it certainly. This he spake onely\r\nto win time to sweare his Consorts to secrecy, and he would finde the\r\nmeanes how they should all returne in that ship with it all for England,\r\notherwise they should be deceived of all. Till this was effected they\r\nthought every houre an age; now for the better conveiance of it aboord,\r\nthey acquainted it to Captaine Davis, master of the ship, and one Master\r\nEdwin Kendall, that for their secrecy and transportation should\r\nparticipate with them: Without further ceremony the match was accepted,\r\nand absolutely concluded, the plot laid, time and place set downe to have\r\nit aboord. But Carter, were it for feare the Governor at last should know\r\nof it, to whom so oft [V.178.] they had denied it; or that the rest should\r\ndeceive him, is uncertaine; but most certaine it is, he revealed all the\r\nplot to Master More: To get so much wealth he knew would please them in\r\nEngland, though it did displease all his Company, and to lose such a prize\r\nhe would not for hazarding a mutiny. So first hee revealed himselfe to\r\nKendall in faire tearmes, reproving his dishonesty, but not being answered\r\naccording to his expectation, he committed both Chard and him to person.\r\nThe next Sabboath day Davis comming on shore, More also taxed with very\r\nhard language and many threats, to lay him fast also if he mended not his\r\nmanners; Davis for the present replied little, but went with him to the\r\nplace of praier: but in the midst of divine service he goeth away,\r\ncommanding all his Sea-men to follow him presently aboord, where he\r\nencourageth them to stand to him like men, and hee would free the\r\nPrisoners, have all the Amber-greece for themselves, and so be gone.\r\n\r\n                   _Chard in danger of hanging._\r\n\r\nThe Governor hearing of this resolution, prepares with his company to\r\nrepulse force with force, so that a generall expectance or a civill\r\nuncivill warre possessed every man; but this threatning gust passed over\r\nmore calmlier then was expected; for Davis having better advised with\r\nhimselfe, repented his rashnesse, and desired a reconcilement with the\r\nGovernor. Peace thus concluded, Kendall was set at libertie, but Chard was\r\ncondemned, and upon the ladder to be hanged for his obstinacy; yet upon\r\nbetter consideration More reprived him, but kept him a prisoner all the\r\ntime he staied in the Country, which was generally thought a very bad\r\nreward for his great desert, and that there was more of this Amber-greece\r\nimbeziled, then would have contented all the finders, that never had any\r\nconsideration at all. The greatest part though More thus recovered, yet\r\nDavis and Kendall had so much, either by the ignorance or connivency of\r\nthe Governors, that arriving in England, they prepared themselves for a\r\nnew voiage; at last they two falling out, the Company having notice\r\nthereof, so tormented them both, they gave over their voiage, and durst\r\nnot be seene a long time after.\r\n\r\n         _Master Mores industry in fortifying and planting._\r\n\r\nThe Governor thus rid of the ship and those discontents, removed his seat\r\nfrom Smiths Ile to Saint Georges, after he had fitted up some small\r\nCabbens of Palmata leaves for his wife and family, in that valley where\r\nnow stands their prime towne called S. Georges, hee began to apply\r\nhimselfe to fortifie the Countrey, and training his men in the exercise of\r\narmes. For although he was but a Carpenter, he was an excellent Artist, a\r\ngood Gunner, very witty and industrious: he built and laid the foundation\r\nof eight or nine Forts, called the Kings Castle, Charles Fort, Pebrook's\r\nFort, Smiths Fort, Pagits Fort, Gates Fort, Warwicks Castle, Saint\r\nKatharines Fort, &c. mounting in them all the Ordnance he had, preparing\r\nthe ground to build Houses, plant Corne, and such Fruits as they had.\r\n\r\n         _A contention of the Minister against the Governor._\r\n\r\nBeing thus busied, and as the necessitie of the time required, keeping his\r\nmen somewhat hard at wok, Master Keath his Minister, were it by the\r\nsecret provocation of some drones, that grew weary or their taskes, or\r\nhis affection to popularity is not certaine: But he begins to tax the\r\nGovernor in the Pulpit, hee did grinde the faces of the poore, oppressing\r\nhis Christian brethren with Pharoahs taxes. More finding this in short\r\ntime, might breed ill bloud, called the Company together and also the\r\nMinister, urging them plainly, to tell him wherein he had deserved those\r\nhard accusations: whereupon, with an universall cry they affirmed the\r\ncontrary, so that Keath downe of his knees to aske him forgivenesse. But\r\nMaster More kindly tooke him up, willing him to kneele to God, and\r\nhereafter be more modest and charitable in his speeches; notwithstanding\r\ntwo other discontents so upbraided More with that doctrine, and stood to\r\nmaintaine it, he impaneled a Jury, with a great deale of seeming much adoe\r\nhe would hang them being condemned, one of them with the very feare, fell\r\ninto a dead Palsie; so that the other was set at libertie, and proved\r\nafter a very good labourer.\r\n\r\n        _Two peeces weighed out of the Sea Adventure._\r\n\r\nMany conclusions he tried about the Sea-venture, the [V.179.] wracke of\r\nSir George Somers, but he got onely for his paines but two peece of\r\nOrdnance. Having framed a Church of timber, it was blowne downe by a\r\ntempest, so that he built another in a more closer place with Palmeta\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n                    _The first supply._\r\n\r\nBefore this yeere was expired, the adventurers sent them an adviso with\r\nthirtie Passengers and good provisions, to prepare with all expedition for\r\ntheir defence against the Spaniard, whom they understood ere long would\r\nvisit them: This occasioned him to keepe all his men together in that Ile\r\nso hard at worke, that wanting libertie to goe abroad for food, living\r\nonely on that they had, and expected daily to receive from England, they\r\nwere so over-toiled, many fell sicke, but none died. Very earnest this\r\nship was to have all the Amber-greece, which M. More perceiving, was the\r\nchiefest cause of their comming, and that it was the onely loadstone to\r\ndraw from England still more supplies; for all the expresse command sent\r\nfrom the Company, he returned this ship but with the one third part; so\r\nfrom thence she went to Virginia, and not long; after arrived safely in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n                                A.D. 1613.\r\n                      _Sir Thomas Smith Treasurer._\r\n\r\n                         _The second supply._\r\n\r\n               _A strange increase of Potatoes._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n              _The attempt of two Spanish ships._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nBut before her returne the Company sent the Martha with sixtie Passengers\r\nmore; they arrived in June with one Master Bartlet to survey the Iland,\r\nand the estate of the Colonie, with expresse command for all the\r\nAmber-greece: but More perceiving him not as he would have him, and that\r\nthe Company began to mistrust him, would send no more but another third\r\npart, wherewith they returned, leaving a French-man to make triall of the\r\nMulberies for Silke, but he did not bring any thing to perfection;\r\nexcusing himselfe, they were not the right Mulberies he expected. About\r\nthis time they were in hope of a small crop of Tobacco, but it was most\r\nspoiled for want of knowledge to use it. Now in England Master More became\r\namongst the Merchants marvelous distastfull, for the detaining so long the\r\nAmber-greece; which delaies they so much abhorred, they forthwith\r\ndispatched the Elizabeth the second time and forty Passengers, much\r\nrebuking More for so long detaining the Amber-greece: for the which,\r\nhaving now no more colourable excuses, he delivered it, wherewith the\r\nship went to Virginia, & thence home. {MN-1} In this ship was brought the\r\nfirst Potato roots, which flourished exceedingly for a time, till by\r\nnegligence they were almost lost (all but two cast-away roots) that so\r\nwonderfully have increased, they are a maine releefe to all the\r\nInhabitants. {MN-2} This ship was not long gone but there came two Spanish\r\nships, sounding with their Boat, which attempted to come in: but from the\r\nKings Castle Master More made but two shot, which caused them presently\r\ndepart. Marke here the handy-worke of the divine providence, for they had\r\nbut three quarters of a barrell of powder, and but one shot more, and the\r\npowder by carelesnesse was tumbled downe under the mussels of the two\r\npeeces were discharged, yet not touched with fire when they were\r\ndischarged.\r\n\r\nThis feare thus past, appeares another much worse, which was the extremity\r\nof famine; in this extremity God sent Captaine Daniel Elfrid with a\r\ncarvell of meale which a little relieved them, but brought withall so many\r\nRats, that within two yeeres after neere ruined all; now though Elfrid had\r\ndeceived his friend Fisher of this Carvell in the West-Indies they\r\nrevenged Fishers injury, for Elfrid had his passage for England, and they\r\nmade use of all he had. Some two moneths after, came in the Blessing with\r\nan hundred Passengers; and two daies after the Starre with a hundred and\r\nfourescore more, amongst which were many Gentlemen, as Master Lower for\r\nMarshall, Master Barret, Master Felgate, and divers others; but very\r\nunproper for what they undertooke. Within foureteene daies after came in\r\nthe Margaret and two Frygats, and in them one hundred and threescore\r\nPassengers; also Master Bartlet came now expresly to divide the Country\r\ninto Tribes, and the Tribes into shares. But Master More finding no\r\nmention made of any part for himselfe nor all them with him, as he was\r\npromised in England, by no meanes would admit of any division, nor suffer\r\nhis men from finishing their fortifications, which was so necessary, it\r\nwas his maine ambition to see that accomplished; but such unkindnesse grew\r\nbetwixt this Master Bartlet and the Governour, that the rude [V.180.]\r\nmultitude with all the disdaine they could devise caused Bartlet returne\r\nfor England as he came. About this time William Millington was drawne into\r\nthe Sea by a fish, but never after ever seene.\r\n\r\n                              A.D. 1614.\r\n                   _Sir Thomas Smith Treasurer._\r\n\r\n                  _A great famine and mortalitie._\r\n\r\nThe neglect of this division was very hardly conceited in England, so that\r\nMaster More grew more and more in dislike with the company;\r\nnotwithstanding he followed the building of these Forts so earnestly,\r\nneglecting planting of Corne, till their store was neere all consumed,\r\nwhereby they became so feeble and weake, some would not, others could not\r\ngoe abroad to seeke releefe, but starved in their houses, and many that\r\nwent abroad, through weaknesse were subject to be suddenly surprized with\r\na disease called the Feauges, which was neither paine nor sicknesse, but\r\nas it were the highest degree of weaknesse, depriving them of power and\r\nability from the execution of any bodily exercises, whether it were\r\nworking, walking, or what else, being thus taken, if any presently gave\r\nthem food many times they straight recovered, yet some after a little rest\r\nwould bee able to walke, but if they found not present succour, died.\r\n\r\n                   _A strange being of Ravens._\r\n\r\nAbout this time or immediatly before, came in a company of Ravens, which\r\ncontinued amongst them all the time of this mortality and then departed,\r\nwhich for any thing knowne, neither before nor since were ever seene or\r\nheard of: this with divers other reasons caused Master More to goe out to\r\nSea, to see if he could discover any other Ilands, but he went not farre\r\nere ill weather forced him backe; and it were a noble adventure of him\r\nwould undertake to make more perfect all the dangers are about the Summer\r\nIles.\r\n\r\n             _All workes abandoned to get only victuals._\r\n\r\nThus famine and misery caused Governour More leave all his workes, and\r\nsend them abroad to get what they could; one hundred and fifty of the most\r\nweake and sicke he sent to Coupers Ile, where were such infinite numbers\r\nof the Birds called Cahowes, which were so fearelesse they might take so\r\nmany as they would, and that admired abundance of fish, that the extremity\r\nof their hunger, and their gluttony was such, those heavenly blessings\r\nthey so consumed and wasted by carelesnesse and surfetting, many of them\r\ndied upon those silly Birds that offered themselves to the slaughter,\r\nwhich the Governour understanding, caused them for change of aire to be\r\nremoved to Port-royall, and a Company of Fishers with a Boat to releeve\r\nthem with fish, but the Gange grew so lazie the poore weaklings still\r\ndied; they that remained killed the Cattle they found in the Ile, faining\r\nthe heat caused them to runne into the Sea and so were drowned; so that\r\nthe Governour sent againe for them home, but some obtained leave still to\r\nlive abroad; one amongst the rest hid himselfe in the Woods, and lived\r\nonely on Wilkes and land Crabs, fat and lusty many moneths, but most of\r\nthem being at Saint Georges, ordinarily was taken one hundred and fifty or\r\ntwo hundred great fishes daily for their food; for want of hookes and\r\nlines, the Smith made hookes of old swords, and lines of old ropes, but\r\nfinding all those poore Engines also decay, they sent one of the two\r\nFrigats last left with them for England, to tell them of this misery. All\r\nwhich was now attributed to Master Mores perversnesse, who at first when\r\nhe got the Amber-Greece had not such a generall applause, but now all the\r\nworst could possibly be suggested was too good for him; yet not knowing\r\nfor the present how to send a better, they let him continue still, though\r\nhis time was neere expired, and with all speed sent the Welcome fraught\r\nwith provision, where shee well arrived, and proved her selfe as welcome\r\nin deed as in name; for all those extremities, Master Lewes Hues writeth,\r\nnot one of all those threescore that first beganne this Plantation was\r\ndead, which shewes it was not impossible, but industry might have\r\nprevented a great part of the others sluggish carelesnesse.\r\n\r\n                _A supply and M. Mores returne._\r\n\r\nThis ship much refreshed this miserable Colony, but Master More seeing\r\nthey sent not for him, his time being now expired, understanding how badly\r\nthey reputed him in England, and that his imploiment now was more for\r\ntheir owne ends then any good for himselfe, resolved directly to returne\r\nwith this ship. Having setled all things in the best order he could, left\r\nthe government to the charge of the counsell of six to succeed each other\r\n[V.181.] monethly, till they had further directions from England; whose\r\nnames were Captaine Miles Kendall, Captaine John Mansfield, Thomas Knight,\r\nCharles Caldycot, Edward Waters, and Christopher Carter, with twelve\r\nothers for their assistances. More thus taking leave of those Ilands,\r\narrived in England, much wrangling they had, but at last they confirmed\r\nhim according to promise eight shares of Land, and so he was dismissed of\r\nhis charge, with shew of favour and much friendship.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    The rule of the six Governors.\r\n\r\n                             A.D. 1615.\r\n                   _Sir Thomas Smith Treasurer._\r\n\r\nThe first thing they did was casting of lots, who should rule first, which\r\nlot lighted upon Master Caldicot. This last supply somewhat abated the\r\nextremitie of their miseries, and the better in that their fortifications\r\nbeing finished, they had the more leasure to goe abroad with that meanes\r\nwas brought to that purpose to fish. Chard as you have heard, whom all\r\nthis while More had kept Prisoner, they set at libertie: now by reason of\r\ntheir former miseries, little or nothing could be done; yet this Governour\r\nhaving thus concluded his moneth, and prepared a Frigot and two and\r\nthirtie men, hee imbarked himselfe with two other of his fellow\r\ncounsellers; namely, Knight and Waters for the West-Indies, to get Fruits\r\nand Plants, Goats, young Cattle, and such like. But this poore vessell,\r\nwhether through ill weather, or want of Mariners, or both, in stead of the\r\nIndies fell with the Canaries, where taking a poore Portugall, the which\r\nthey manned with ten of their owne people, as soone after separated from\r\nher in a storme, & the next day was taken by a French Pickaroune, so that\r\nthe Frigot out of hope of her prize, makes a second time for the\r\nWest-Indies, where she no sooner arrived, but foundred in the sea; but the\r\nmen in their Boat recovered a desolate Ile, where after some few moneths\r\nstay, an English Pyrat tooke them in, and some of them at last got for\r\nEngland, and some few yeares after returned to the Somer Iles.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Captaine John Mansfield his moneth.\r\n\r\nThe Frigot thus gone, Captaine Mansfield succeeded. Then was contrived a\r\npetition, as from the generalitie, unto the triumverat Governors; wherein\r\nthey supplicated, that by no meanes they should resigne the government to\r\nany should come from England, upon what tearmes soever, untill six moneths\r\nafter the returne of their ship sent to the West-Indies: about this\r\nunwarrantable action, Master Lewes Hues their Preacher was so violent in\r\nsuppressing it, that such discontents grew betwixt the Governors and him,\r\nand divisions among the Company, he was arraigned, condemned, and\r\nimprisoned, but not long detained before released. Then the matter fell so\r\nhotly againe to be disputed betwixt him and one Master Keath a Scotch-man,\r\nthat professed schollership, that made all the people in a great\r\ncombustion: much adoe there was, till at last as they sate in the Church\r\nand ready to proceed to a judicary course against Master Hues, suddenly\r\nsuch an extreme gust of wind and weather so ruffled in the trees and\r\nChurch; some cried out a miracle; others, it was but an accident common in\r\nthose Iles, but the noise was so terrible it desolved the assembly:\r\nnotwithstanding, Master Hues was againe imprisoned, and as suddenly\r\ndischarged; but those factions were so confused, and their relations so\r\nvariable, that such unnecessary circumstances were better omitted then any\r\nmore disputed.\r\n\r\n           _Master Carter. Captaine Kendall. Capt. Mansfield._\r\n\r\nThis mans moneth thus ended, begins Master Carter, which was altogether\r\nspent in quietnesse, and then Captaine Miles Kendall had the rule, whose\r\nmoneth was also as quietly spent as his Predecessors. Then Captaine\r\nMansfield begins his second moneth, when the ship called the Edwin arrived\r\nwith good supplies. About this time divers Boats going to sea were lost,\r\nand some men drowned; and many of the Company repaired to Master [V.182.]\r\nHues, that there might bee a Councell according to Master Mores order\r\nof six Governours, and twelve Assistants, whereupon grew as many more such\r\nsilly brawles as before, which at last concluded with as simple a\r\nreconciliation. In the interim happened to a certaine number of private\r\npersons as miserable and lamentable an accident, as ever was read or heard\r\nof, and thus it was:\r\n\r\n                    _A wonderful accident._\r\n\r\nIn the month of March, a time most subject of all others to such tempests;\r\non a Friday there went seven men in a boat of two or three tunnes to fish.\r\nThe morning being faire, so eager they were of their journey, some went\r\nfasting: neither carried they either meat or drinke with them, but a few\r\nPalmeta berries, but being at their fishing place some foure leagues from\r\nthe shoare, such a tempest arose, they were quickly driven from the sight\r\nof land in an overgrowne Sea, despairing of all hope, onely committing\r\nthemselves to Gods mercy, let the boat drive which way shee would. On\r\nSunday the storme being somewhat abated, they hoysed saile as they thought\r\ntowards the Island. In the evening it grew starke calme; so that being too\r\nweake to use their oares, they lay a drift that night. The next morning\r\nAndrew Milliard, for now all his companions were past strength either to\r\nhelpe him or themselves: before a small gale of wind spred his saile\r\nagaine. On Tuesday one died, whom they threw over board. On Wednesday\r\nthree. And on Thursday at night the sixt. All these but the last were\r\nburied by Hilliard in the Sea, for so weake hee was growne hee could not\r\nturne him over as the rest, whereupon hee stripped him, ripping his belly\r\nwith his knife, throwing his bowels into the water, hee spread his body\r\nabroad tilted open with a sticke, and so lets it lie as a cisterne to\r\nreceive some lucky raine-water, and this God sent him presently after, so\r\nthat in one small shoure hee recovered about foure spoonefuls of raine\r\nwater to his unspeakeable refreshment; he also preserved neere halfe a\r\npint of blood in a shooe, which he did sparingly drinke of to moist his\r\nmouth: two severall daies he fed on his flesh, to the quantity of a pound,\r\non the eleventh day from his losing the sight of land, two flying fishes\r\nfals in his boat, whose warme jucie blood hee sucked to his great comfort.\r\nBut within an houre after to his greater comfort you will not doubt, he\r\nonce againe descried the land, and within foure houres after was cast upon\r\na rocke neere to Port royall, where his boat was presently split in\r\npieces, but himselfe, though extreamly weake, made shift to clamber up so\r\nsteepe and high a rocke, as would have troubled the ablest man in the Ile\r\nto have done that by day hee did by night.\r\n\r\nBeing thus astride on a rocke, the tumbling Sea had gotten such possession\r\nin his braines, that a good while it was before his giddy head would\r\nsuffer him to venture upon the forsaking it: towards the morning he\r\ncraules a shore, and then to his accomplished joy descernes where hee is,\r\nand travels halfe a day without any refreshment then water, whereof wisely\r\nand temperately he stinted him selfe, otherwise certainely hee had drunke\r\nhis last. In which case hee attaines a friends house: where at the first\r\nthey tooke him for a ghost, but at last acknowledged and received him with\r\njoy, his story after some houres of recovery of strength to tell it, heard\r\nout with admiration: he was not long after conveyed to the towne, where he\r\nreceived his former health, and was living in the yeere 1622.\r\n\r\n                _Treasure found in the Summer Iles._\r\n\r\nThe next newes that happened in this time of ease, was, that a merry\r\nfellow having found some few Dollars against Flemish wracke, the bruit\r\nwent currant the treasure was found, and they all made men. Much adoe\r\nthere was to prevent the purloining of it, before they had it: where after\r\nthey had tyred themselves with searching, that they found, amounted not to\r\nabove twenty pounds starling, which is not unlike but to be the remainder\r\nof some greater store, washed from some wracke not farre from the shore.\r\n\r\n                      _A new Governour chosen._\r\n\r\nThe company by the Edwin receiving newes of the revels were kept in Sommer\r\nIles, resolved to make choice of a new Governour, called Master Daniel\r\nTuckar, that a long time had bin a planter in Virginia in the government\r\nof Captaine Smith. All things being furnished for [V.183.] his voyage; hee\r\nset saile in the George, consorted with the Edwin, with many passengers,\r\nwhich being discovered by them in those Iles, they supposed them the\r\nFrigot sent to the West Indies; but when they understood what they were,\r\nmuch preparation they made to resist the new Governour. Many great\r\nostentations appeared on both sides, but when the quondam Governour did\r\nsee his men for most part forsake him; all was very well and quietly\r\ncompounded, and with much kindnesse received and welcomed a shore, where\r\nhis Commission was no sooner read, then they accepted and acknowledged him\r\nfor their Governour.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            A.D. 1616.\r\n                 _Sir Thomas Smith Treasurer._\r\n\r\n             The Government of Captaine Daniel Tuckar.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the midst of May arrived this Governor, where finding the\r\nInhabitants both abhorring all exacted labour, as also in a manner\r\ndisdaining and grudging much to be commanded by him; it could not but\r\npassionate any man living. But at last according to the Virginia order,\r\nhee set every one was with him at Saint Georges, to his taske, to cleere\r\ngrounds, fell trees, set corne, square timber, plant vines and other\r\nfruits brought out of England. These by their taske Masters by breake a\r\nday repaired to the wharfe, from thence to be imployed to the place of\r\ntheir imployment, till nine of the clocke, and then in the after-noone\r\nfrom three till Sunne-set. Beside meat, drinke and cloaths, they had for\r\na time a certaine kinde of brasse money with a hogge on the one side, in\r\nmemory of the abundance of hogges was found at their first landing.\r\n\r\n                    _Captaine Tuckars proceedings._\r\n\r\nThis course thus squared, imitating divers orders used in Virginia, by Sir\r\nTho. Dale: he began by them to looke into his instructions given by the\r\nCompany. Whereupon by one Mr. Richard Norwood a Survayor, sent over for\r\nthat purpose, in the time of Master Moore, hee began to lay out the eight\r\ntribes in the maine, which were to consist of fifty shares to a tribe; and\r\ntwenty five acers to every share. He also began to plant some Colony men\r\non some of the especiall shares. He swore also certaine of the chiefe men\r\nof every tribe to bee Bailiffes thereof; and appointed as many men as hee\r\nwas able for all supplied shares. The goods landed in the store houses hee\r\nsent from thence, and dispersed it to his workemen in generall: some Boats\r\nalso began to be builded; but the pinace called the Thomas suspected might\r\nmake an escape, was laid up in a docke, where shee yet remaineth.\r\n\r\n                 _A Barke sent to the West Indies._\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the second moneth of his government, he directed\r\nwarrants to all the Bailiffes, for the holding of a generall Assise at\r\nSaint Georges, and appointed Master Stokes Lieutenant of the Kings Castle\r\nat the Gurnets head. The Edwin came with him he sent to the West Indies by\r\ndirections from England, to trade with the natives, for cattell, corne,\r\nplants, and other commodities. A course of great importance, which had\r\nit been pursued, would certainly have produced more hopefull effects for\r\nthe good of the Colony, then all the supplies and Magazines from England\r\nhath or will in a long time.\r\n\r\n                             _The Assises._\r\n\r\nPresently after her departure began the Assises, executed by his Deputy.\r\nThe chiefe matter handled was the hanging one John Wood a French man, for\r\nspeaking many distastefull and mutinous speeches against the Governour, to\r\nshew the rest by that example, the power of his authority, which after\r\nwith his owne hands he so oft executed with a bastinado amongst the poorer\r\nsort; many tearmed it a cruelty, not much lesse then tyranny: but the\r\nsequell is more then strange.\r\n\r\n             _The strange adventure of five men in a boat._\r\n\r\nSo it was that five of them, seeing by no meanes they could get passage\r\nfor England, resolved to undergoe all hazards but they would make an\r\nescape from such servitude. The chiefe mariner and plotter of this\r\nbusinesse, was Richard Sanders and his confederates, William Goodwin a\r\nship Carpenter, Thomas Harison a Joyner; James Barker a Gentleman, and\r\nHenry Puet. These repairing to the Governour, and with pleasing\r\ninsinuations told him, if hee would allow them but things [V.184.]\r\nnecessary, they would build him a boat of two or three tunnes, with a\r\nclose decke, should goe a fishing all weathers. The Governour halfe proud\r\nthat hee had brought his men to so good a passe, as he conceived, to offer\r\nthemselves to so necessary a worke; instantly with all willingnesse\r\nfurnished them with all things they could desire, and many faire promises\r\nto incourage them to performe it with all expedition. Having made choise\r\nof a place most fit from molestation, they went forward with that\r\nexpedition, that in a short time shee was brought to perfection. By this\r\ntime, the ship that brought the Governour, being ready to depart, hee\r\nsends a lusty gange to goe fetch his new boat to carry him aboard, but\r\narriving at the place where she was built, they could heare no more of\r\nher, but she was gone the last evening to Sea, to try how shee would\r\nsaile. Much search and dispute was where this boat should be: but at last\r\nthey found divers letters in the cabbins, to this effect, directed to the\r\nGovernour, and other their friends: that their hard and bad usage was so\r\nintolerable, and their hope so small ever againe to see their Countrey, or\r\nbe delivered from such servitude, they did rather chuse to put themselves\r\nto that desperate hazard to goe for England, in which if they miscaried,\r\nas it was much to be mistrusted, their lives and bloods should be required\r\nat their hands was the cause. A compasse Diall Barker had borrowed of\r\nMaster Hues, to whom he writ that as hee had oft perswaded them to\r\npatience, and that God would pay them though none did: hee must now bee\r\ncontented with the losse of his Diall, with his owne doctrine. Such\r\nleasure they found to bee merry when in the eye of reason they were\r\nmarching into a most certaine ruine. The Governour being thus satisfied of\r\ntheir escape, extreamly threatned them no lesse then a hanging, but the\r\nstormes of the Ocean they now more feared then him; good provision by\r\nbartering they had got from the ship, where Goodwin in a bravado told the\r\nMariners, though he could not be permitted to goe with them, yet\r\nperadventure hee might be in England before them, whereat the Master and\r\nhis Mate laughed merrily. But having beene now under saile three weekes,\r\nthe winds so favoured them, they felt nothing of what they had cause to\r\nfeare: then a blustering gale blowing in their teeth, put them to much\r\nextremity for divers dayes, then becomming more gentle away they past\r\nprosperously some eight or ten dayes more, till meeting a French\r\nPiccaroune of whom they desired succour, hee like himselfe tooke from them\r\nwhat hee liked, leaving them not so much as a crosse-staffe to observe\r\nwithall, and so cast them off: their course still they continued till\r\ntheir victuall began to fall to the lowest ebbe; and the very knees of\r\ntheir small vessell were halfe hewed away for fire wood. At last to their\r\ninfinit joy they arrived in Ireland, where the Earle of Tomund honorably\r\nentertained them, and caused the boat to be hung up for a Monument, and\r\nwell she might, for shee had sailed more then 3300. miles by a right line\r\nthorow the maine Sea, without any sight of land, and I thinke since God\r\nmade the world, the like navigation was never done, nor heard of. This\r\nfortunate Sanders going to the East Indies, in the rifling some ships\r\nthere tooke, it was his chance to buy an old chest, for three or foure\r\nshillings, but because it wanted a key hee repented his bargaine, and\r\nwould gladly have sold it againe for lesse. A certaine time it lay tossed\r\nto and fro as a thing hee little regarded, but at last having little to\r\ndoe, hee broke it open, where he found a thousand pounds starling, or so\r\nmuch gold as bought him in England a good estate, which leaving with his\r\nwife he returned againe to the East Indies.\r\n\r\n               _Plants from the West Indies._ {MN-1}\r\n\r\n              _The exploits of Captaine Powell._ {MN-2}\r\n\r\nThe George setting saile three dayes after this escape, the Governour\r\nseazed and confiscated all that those fugitives left behinde them. {MN-1}\r\nWithin a weeke after returned the Edwin from the West Indies, furnished\r\nwith figges, pynes, sugar-canes, plantaines, papanes and divers other\r\nplants, which were presently replanted, and since increased into greater\r\nnumbers, also an Indian and a Negar, and so much ligna vitae as defrayed\r\nall the charge. The Governor thus busied amongst his plants, making hedges\r\nof Figtrees, and Pomgranets, and severall divisions by Palizadoes for the\r\ndefence of their guarding [V.185.] and keeping their cattell, for in such\r\nhusbandry qualities he well deserved great commendations. The Adventurers\r\nto supply him sent with all speed they could the Hopewell, a small Barke,\r\nbut an excellent sailer, {MN-2} and in her one Captaine Powell an\r\nexcellent Mariner, and well acquainted in the Indies where he was to goe\r\ntrade, after he had landed his passengers in the Summer lies: but in his\r\njourney at the Westerne Iles meeting a Brasile man, hee liked the suger\r\nand passengers so well, hee mand the Carvill with his owne men, and\r\ncontinued his course, but bethinking himself how this would be entertained\r\nat the Summer lies, hee found such doubts, hee went directly for the West\r\nIndies to take time to resolve what to doe: arriving there hee met a\r\nFrench rover, one every way as cunning as himselfe, but much more\r\ntrecherous. A great league of kindnesse is soone made betweene them, upon\r\nconfidence whereof, Powell and some of the chiefe with him being invited\r\naboord him, is easily entised, and in the midst of their cups both hee and\r\nhis company treacherously made prisoners; and thus was forced to give him\r\ntheir prise, or hang at the yards arme with all his company. Having set\r\nthem a shore, away goes the French man; Powels ship being but hard by,\r\npresently fetcht them all a boord, but finding his victuall neere spent,\r\nand no hope at all to recover his prize, set his Portugales on shore, and\r\nset saile for the Summer Iles; where safely arriving, hee declared the\r\nwhole passage to the Governour, lest some other in telling might make it\r\nworse, of which the Governour seemed well enough to approve.\r\n\r\n                        _The second Assises._\r\n\r\nThis Governour still spent his time in good husbandry, although some of\r\nthe snarling sort here in England, whom nothing will please, writ to him\r\nhee was fitter to be a Gardiner then a Governour: some time he spent in\r\ndigging of a great pond, but that worke proved altogether unprofitable:\r\nabout that time was held the second Assise. The greatest matter passed,\r\nwas a Proclamation against the spoile of Cahowes, but it came too late,\r\nfor they were most destroyed before: a platforme hee caused to be erected\r\nby Pagits Fort, where a good Fort were very necessary. Captaine Powell not\r\nhaving performed his service in the West Indies, he conditioned with the\r\nCompany, is sent thither againe by this Governour, and thirteene or\r\nfourteene of his best men, furnished with all things necessary. In the\r\nmeane time the Company understanding, that in January, February and March,\r\nthere are many Whales, for which fishing they sent the Neptune, a tall\r\nship well provided with every thing fitting for that purpose. But before\r\nshe arrived, Captaine Tuckar, who had brought also with him most\r\nprovisions for that imploiment, sent three good Shalops to try what could\r\nbe done, but whether it was the swiftnes of the Whale in swimming, or the\r\ncondition of the place, certaine it is for all their labour and hazard,\r\nthey could kill none, though they strucke many.\r\n\r\n                          A.D. 1617.\r\n                _Sir Thomas Smith Treasurer._\r\n\r\n                     _The third Assise._\r\n\r\nTo begin his second yeere, he called the third Assise, where divers were\r\npunished as their faults deserved: three were condemned to die; two were\r\nreprived, but the third was hanged: the next day there was also a levy for\r\nthe repairing two Forts; but that labour tooke not such effect as was\r\nintended, for want of good directions.\r\n\r\n\r\n             _The country neere devoured with rats._\r\n\r\nBut the great God of heaven being angry at somewhat happened in those\r\nproceedings, caused such an increase of silly rats, in the space of two\r\nyeeres so to abound, before they regarded them, that they filled not onely\r\nthese places where they were first landed, but swimming from place to\r\nplace, spread themselves into all parts of the Countrey, insomuch that\r\nthere was no Iland but it was pestered with them; and some fishes have\r\nbeene taken with rats in their bellies, which they caught in swimming\r\nfrom Ile to Ile: their nests they had almost in every tree, and in most\r\nplaces their burrowes in the ground like conies: they spared not the\r\nfruits of the plants, or trees, nor the very plants themselves, but ate\r\nthem up. When they had set their corne, the rats would come by troupes in\r\nthe night and scratch it out of the ground. If by diligent watch any\r\nescaped till it came to earing, it should then very hardly escape them:\r\nand they became noysome even to the very persons of men. They used all the\r\ndiligence they could for the destroying of them, [V.186.] nourishing cats\r\nboth wilde and tame, for that purpose; they used rats-bane, and many times\r\nset fire on the woods, that oft ran halfe a mile before it was extinct;\r\nevery man was enjoyned to set twelve traps, and some of their owne accord\r\nhave set neere an hundred, which they ever visited twice or thrice in a\r\nnight; they also trained up their dogges to hunt them, wherein they became\r\nso expert, that a good dog in two or three houres would kil forty or\r\nfifty. Many other devices they used to destroy them, but could not\r\nprevaile, finding them still increasing against them: nay they so devoured\r\nthe fruits of the earth, that they were destitute of bread for a yeere or\r\ntwo; so that when they had it afterwards, they were so wained from it,\r\nthey easily neglected to eat it with their meat. Besides they endevoured\r\nso much for the planting Tobacco for present gaine, that they neglected\r\nmany things might more have prevailed for their good, which caused amongst\r\nthem much weaknesse and mortality, since the beginning of this vermine.\r\n\r\n               _A strange confusion of rats._\r\n\r\nAt last it pleased God, but by what meanes it is not well knowne, to take\r\nthem away; in so much that the wilde cats and many dogs which lived on\r\nthem, were famished, and many of them leaving the woods, came downe to\r\ntheir houses, and to such places where they use to garbish their fish, and\r\nbecame tame. Some have attributed the destruction of them to the encrease\r\nof wild cats, but that is not likely they should be so suddenly encreased\r\nrather at that time, then foure yeeres before; and the chiefe occasion of\r\nthis supposition was, because they saw some companies of them leave the\r\nwoods, and slew themselves for want of food. Others by the coldnesse of\r\nwinter, which notwithstanding is never so great there, as with us in\r\nMarch, except it be in the wind: besides the rats wanted not the fethers\r\nof young birds and chickins, which they daily killed, and Palmeta mosse\r\nto build themselves warme nests out of the wind, as usually they did;\r\nneither doth it appeare that the cold was so mortall to them, seeing they\r\nwould ordinarily swimme from place to place, and bee very fat even in the\r\nmidst of winter. It remaineth then, that as God doth sometimes effect his\r\nwill without subordinate and secondary causes, so wee need not doubt, but\r\nthat in the speedy encrease of this vermine; as also by the preservation\r\nof so many of them by such weake meanes as they then enjoyed, and\r\nespecially in the so sudden removall of this great annoyance, there was\r\njoyned with and besides the ordinary and manifest meanes, a more mediate\r\nand secret worke of God.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Henry Long, with seven others in an extreame storme were\r\ncast away, but three of them escaped. One of them being asked what hee\r\nthought in the worst of that extremity, answered, he thought nothing but\r\ngallowes claime thy right, and it seemes God well heard his prayer, and\r\nrewarded his ingratitude; for he was hanged within halfe a yeere after. In\r\nthat March also five men went to Sea, but as yet was never heard of, and\r\nthree more drowned in a boat. By Hilliards house grew a very faire Cedar,\r\nwhich by a thunder clap was rent almost to small shivers, and a man stood\r\nby him, and Samuel Tanton, most fearfully blasted, yet neither they, the\r\nhouse, nor a little childe, yet a paire of racks in the house was all\r\ntorne to fitters. The Neptune not long after arriving to fish for whale,\r\nher fortune proved no better then the Governours, yet some are of opinion,\r\nprofit might be made by them.\r\n\r\n          _The returne of M. Powel from the Indies._\r\n\r\nIn May they discried foure saile, so that manning all their Forts, they\r\nstood two daies in Armes, expecting what they were; at last they found it\r\nMaster Powell returned from the West-Indies in the Hopewell, where missing\r\nsuch trade as he expected, these three Frigots comming in his way, he\r\ncould not chuse but take them; Meale, Hides and Munition was their lading:\r\nFaire weather the Governor made with Powell till he had got all the goods\r\ninto his owne possession, and then called Powell to a strict account for\r\ndoing such an unwarrantable act; much a doe then was betwixt the taker and\r\nreceiver; but Powell was glad to be excused to answer it in England,\r\nleaving all hee had taken behinde him in the Iles: The Neptune also\r\nreturned with him, but noble Powell lost all his pay and pillage for this\r\nyeeres worke. For which the Company [V.187.] sent for to Tuckar, so that\r\nhe also lost his part as well as Powell: Notwithstanding, the Governour by\r\nthis meanes being strong in shipping, fitted the Carvill with twelve men,\r\nunder the command of Edward Waters formerly spoken of, and sent them to\r\nVirginia about such businesse as hee had conceived. Arriving there, they\r\nobtained some goates, and hogs, & what they could spare, and so returned\r\nfor the Summer Iles; but whether they could not finde the Iles for want of\r\nskill, or beaten off by ill weather, or the ill will they bare the\r\nGovernor, it matters not much: but they bare up again for Virginia, where\r\nthey all remained, and would returne no more to Summer lies.\r\n\r\n            _A supposed mutiny by M. Pollard, and M. Rich._\r\n\r\nThe Governour thinking to make some use of the hides, set some that\r\nprofessed themselves Tanners, to make tryall of their skill; but they lost\r\ntheir labours and spoiled the hides. Also he called another Assise\r\nconcerning a poore fellow called Gabriel, for concealing some speeches M.\r\nPollard and M. Rich should use, tending to the dis-reputation of the\r\nGovernour, and his injustice and cruelties; which being brought within the\r\ncompasse of sedition and mutiny, though a yeere agoe; many were called in\r\nquestion about it, although every one ordinarily had spoke as much. Yet\r\nGabriel for example sake was condemned to bee hanged, and was upon the\r\nladder, but reprieved. The other two M. Pollard, and M. Rich were\r\nimprisoned, but upon better consideration the fact appeared so small and\r\nridiculous, upon their submission they were pardoned, and restored to\r\ntheir places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    The division of the Summer lies into Tribes, by\r\n       Master Richard Norwood, Surveyor.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          A.D. 1618.\r\n              _Sir Thomas Smith Treasurer._\r\n\r\n          _The division of the Iles into Tribes._\r\n\r\nAccording to the directions of the Councell and company as they had\r\ndetermined by lot, M. Norwood tooke a plot of the Ile, and divided it with\r\nas much faithfulnes as he could, assigning to every Adventurer his share\r\nor proportion, as namely, to lay out a large proportion, to bee called the\r\ngenerall land, and imployed for publike uses, as for the maintenance of\r\nthe Governour, Ministers, Commanders of Forts, souldiers, and such like:\r\nand to this end was assigned S. Georges Iland, S. Davids Iland,\r\nLongbridge Iland, Smiths Iland, Coopers Iland, Cony Iland, Nonesuch Iland,\r\npart of the maine, and sundry other small Iles. The rest was to be divided\r\ninto eight parts, each part to be called a tribe, and to have his\r\ndenomination of some principall person that was Adventurer therein: and\r\naccordingly the first Tribe to bee Eastward, was then called Bedfords\r\nTribe, now Hamiltons: the second, Smiths: Tribe the third, Cavendish, now\r\nDevonshires: the fourth, Pembrooks: the fift, Pagits: the sixt, Mansils,\r\nnow Warwicks: the seventh, Southampton: the eighth, Sands: in the honours\r\nof the Right honorable the Marquis Hamilton, Sir Thomas Smith, the Earle\r\nof Devonshire, the Earle of Pembrooke, the Lord Pagit, the Earle of\r\nWarwicke, the Earle of Southampton, and Sir Edwin Sands. Againe each of\r\nthose Tribes were to bee divided into fifty parts, called shares; and\r\nevery Adventurer to have his shares in these tribes as was determined, by\r\ncasting lots in England, the manner of it appeares by the Map, and more\r\nlargely by his Booke of the Survay of the Countrey, which is in the\r\nRecords of the Colony. And then began this which was before as you have\r\nheard, but as an unsetled and confused Chaos, to receive a disposition,\r\nforme, and order, and become indeed a Plantation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    The names of the Adventurers, and their shares in    [V.188]\r\n       every Tribe, according to the survey, and the\r\n       best information yet ascertained, of any of\r\n       their alterations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Hamiltons Tribe.\r\n\r\n                           Shares.

About this time arrived the Diana with\r\na good supply of men and provision, and the first Magazin ever seene in\r\nthose Iles; which course is not so much commended here, as cursed and\r\nabhorred by reason of enhansements of all the Inhabitants there; six or\r\nseven weeks this ship staied, then having towards her fraught thirtie\r\nthousand weight of Tobacco; which proving good, and comming to a lucky\r\nMarket, gave great encouragement to the Adventurers to goe lustily forward\r\nin their Plantation, and without such successe, there is nothing but\r\ngrudging and repining. But about the appropriation of this new built\r\nhouse, many bad discontents grew betwixt the oppressed Colony and the\r\nGovernor, especially betwixt him and the Minister, and Lewes, who would\r\nneither be feared with threats nor imprisonment, that their malice\r\ncontinued till they met in England, of which the Minister made the cause\r\nso plaine, hee very well and honestly it seemes, discharged himselfe.\r\n\r\n                   _Two exploits of desperate Fugitives._\r\n\r\nNow in those times of these endlesse uncivill broiles, two desperate men\r\nand a proper Gentlewoman got into a Boat, and thinking to make an escape\r\nto Virginia, as appeared by some Letters they left behinde them were never\r\nmore heard on. The very next moneth after the like was attempted by six\r\nothers, so desirous they were to be rid of their servitude; but their plot\r\nbeing discovered by one of their societie, they were apprehended,\r\narraigned, and condemned to be hanged: the next day being led with halters\r\nabout their neckes to the place of execution, one was hanged, and the rest\r\nreprived.\r\n\r\n                    _The arrival of the Blessing._\r\n\r\nThe Diana arriving well in England, for all the infinite numbers of\r\ncomplaints, the Tobacco did helpe to sweeten all manner of grievances, yet\r\nit bred a distaste in the opinions of so many, they began to thinke of\r\nanother Governor; but for that time it was so qualified by divers of his\r\nfriends, they dispatched away the Blessing, which arrived in the Somer\r\nIles. Though their generall Letter was faire and courteous to the\r\nGovernor, yet by the report of the Passengers and divers particular\r\nletters from his friends, it was assured him his cruelty and\r\ncovetousnesse, for all his paines and industry was much disliked, nor was\r\nhe like to enjoy his house, and that land he had [V.190.] planted for\r\nhimselfe, by the extreme oppression of the Comminalty. This caused so many\r\njelousies to arise in his conceit, that at last he fully resolved to\r\nreturne by this ship, that no sooner set saile from England, then they\r\nproceeded to the nomination of a new Governor. Many were presented\r\naccording to the affections of those that were to give in their voices,\r\nbut it chiefely rested betwixt one Captaine Southwell, and one Mr.\r\nNathaniel Butler, where wee will leave them a while to the consideration\r\nof the Court and Company. Now Captaine Tuckar having instituted Captaine\r\nKendall one of the six Governors before spoken of for his substitute,\r\nreturned with this ship directly for England, as well to excuse himselfe\r\nof those objections he suspected, as to get assured him the house and land\r\nhe had alotted for himselfe, lest it might otherwise be disposed of in\r\nhis absence.\r\n\r\n                   Collected out of their Records by N. B. and the\r\n                       relations of M. Pollard, and divers others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           The Government of Captaine Miles Kendall,\r\n                  Deputy for Captaine Tuckar.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _The arrival of two ships._\r\n\r\nThe unexpected returne of Captaine Tuckar, caused a demurre in the\r\nelection of the new Governor; some perswading these oft changes were so\r\ntroublesome, dangerous, and chargeable, it were best to continue Captaine\r\nKendall; others againe stood for Captaine Tuckar, but during the time of\r\nthese opinions, the Gilliflower was dispatched with a supply. Now I should\r\nhave remembred, Tuckar was no sooner out of the harbour, but he met Master\r\nElfred in a ship called the Treasurer, sent from Virginia to trade: by her\r\nhe writ to his Deputy Master Kendall, to have a care of all things, and\r\nbeware of too much acquaintance with this ship, which hee suspected was\r\nbound for the West-Indies. Notwithstanding, Elfred received what kindnesse\r\nthe Ile could afford; he promised to revisit them at his returne; this\r\ndone, because they would not be governlesse when his Deputiship was\r\nexpired, there was a generall assembly, and by that Election Kendall was\r\nconfirmed to succeed still Governor. Now they began to apply themselves to\r\nthe finishing some plat-forme about Smiths Fort, and laying the foundation\r\nof a Church to be built of Cedar, till the Gillyflower arrived with some\r\nprivate letters to Kendall, how he was elected Governor of those Iles for\r\nthree yeeres. During her stay they held their Assises, where for some few\r\nsuspected facts three were condemned, and the better to terrifie the rest,\r\nled to the place of execution, but reprieved; divers of the rest had their\r\nfaults pardoned, and the Gilliflower set saile for New found land.\r\n\r\n                   _Captain Butler chosen Governour._\r\n\r\nThe love and kindnesse, honesty and industry of this Captaine Kendall,\r\nhath beene very much commended; by others, somewhat disliked  but an\r\nAngell in those imploiments cannot please all men, yet this consideration\r\nbred much ill bloud as well here as there, so that the Company directly\r\nconcluded, Captaine Butler should with what expedition they could, goe to\r\nbe their Governor: In the Interim they tooke the opportunitie of a ship,\r\ncalled the Sea-flower, bound for Virginia, and by her sent a Preacher and\r\nhis Family, with divers Passengers, and newes of a new Governor. This bred\r\na great distaste amongst many, that still they should have new officers\r\nand strangers for their Governors they never heard of, and themselves\r\nstill kept there whether they would or no, without any preferment, no nor\r\nscarce any of them their inhabiting, to have any land at all of their\r\nowne, but live all as tenants, or as other mens poore servants.\r\n\r\nAbout this time came in Captaine Kerby with a small Barke from the\r\nWest-Indies, who having refreshed himselfe, was very kindly used by the\r\nGovernor and so [V.191.] departed. Not long after a Dutch Frigot was cast\r\naway upon the Westerne shore, yet by the helpe of the English they saved\r\nthe men, though the ship perished amongst the Rocks. A little after one\r\nEnsigne Wood being about the loading of a peece, by thrusting a pike into\r\nthe concavitie, grating upon the shot, or somewhat about the powder,\r\nstrucke fire within her and so discharged, but wounded him cruelly and\r\nblew him into the Sea, though hee was got out by some that stood by him,\r\nyet hee died of those wounds. Within two or three daies after, Captaine\r\nElfred now comes in a second time: but of that we shall say more in the\r\ngovernment of Captaine Butler, who presently after arrived with a good\r\nsupply, and was kindly entertained by Captaine Kendall and all the Colony.\r\n\r\n                     From a relation of Tho. Sparks, and divers others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                A.D. 1619\r\n             The Government of Captaine Nathaniel Butler.\r\n\r\n\r\n         _A plat-forme burnt, and much hurt by a Hericano._\r\n\r\nCaptaine Butler being arrived the twentieth of October, 1619. some\r\nmutterings there was how to maintaine their election of Captaine Kendall,\r\nbut better remembring themselves, that conceit quickly dissolved. The next\r\nday, Kendall, the Ministers, and the Counsell went aboord to salute the\r\nnew Governor, where after they had dined with the best entertainment he\r\ncould give them; they saw the Redout belonging to the Kings Castle by a\r\nmischance on fire, whither he repaired with all the meanes he could to\r\nquench it; but all the platforme and cariages were consumed before their\r\nfaces, and they could not helpe it. Two daies after he went up to the\r\nTowne, had his Commission publikely read, made a short speech to the\r\nCompany, and so tooke upon him the government. Then presently he began to\r\nrepaire the most necessary defects: The next moneth came in the Garland,\r\nsent from England six or seven weekes before him; so that being seventeene\r\nweeks in her voyage, it was so tedious and grievous to divers of the\r\nFresh-water Passengers, that such a sicknesse bred amongst them, many died\r\nas well Sailers as Passengers. Having taken the best order he could for\r\ntheir releefe, passed through all the Tribes, and held his first Assise in\r\nCaptaine Tuckars house at the over-plus. Towards the last of this moneth\r\nof Novemb. there arose a most terrible storme or Hericano, that blew up\r\nmany great trees by the roots: the Warwick that brought the Governor was\r\ncast away, but the Garland rid by her, saved her selfe by cutting downe\r\nher Masts; and not long after a second storme, no lesse violent then the\r\nfirst, wherein the Mount which was a frame of wood built by Master More\r\nfor a Watch-tower to looke out to Sea, was blowne up by the roots, and all\r\nthat Winter crop of corne blasted: And thus was the new Governor welcomed.\r\n\r\n                 _The refortifying the Kings Castle._\r\n\r\n                     _Amber-greece found._ {MN}\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of the new yeere he began his first peece of\r\nfortification, upon a Rocke which flankers the Kings Castle, and finding\r\nthe ship called the Treasurer starke rotten and unserviceable, hee tooke\r\nnine peeces of Ordinance from her to serve other uses. The Garland for\r\nwant of meanes, could not make her voiage to Virginia as she was\r\nappointed; wherefore he entertained her to returne to England, with all\r\nthe Tabacco they had in the Ile. It was January before she departed, in\r\nwhich time shee failed not much to have beene twice cast away. But those\r\nstrange and unavoidable mischances, rather seemed to quicken the Governors\r\nindustry then to dull it. Having finished the Church begun by Captaine\r\nKendall, with an infinite toile and labour he got three peeces out of the\r\nwracke Warwicke. Having an excellent Dutch Carpinter he entertained of\r\nthem that were cast away in the Dutch Frigot; he imploied him in building\r\nof Boats, whereof they were in exceeding great want. In February they\r\ndiscovered a tall ship beating too and againe, as it seemed by her working\r\nbeing ignorant of the Coast; some thought her a Spaniard to view their\r\nForts, which stand most to that part she so neerely [V.192.] approached;\r\nsome, English; but the most, some Dutch man of Warre: The wind blew so\r\nhigh, they durst not send out a Boat, though they much doubted she would\r\nbe foule of their Rocks, but at last she bore up rommy for the Sea, and\r\nwe heard of her no more. {MN} That evening, a lucky fellow it should seeme\r\nhe was, that found a peece of Amber-greece of eight ounces, as he had\r\ntwice before, which bringing to the Governor, he had ready money for the\r\none halfe, after three pound an ounce, according to their order of Court,\r\nto encourage others to looke out for more, and prevent the mischiefe\r\ninsueth by concealing of it.\r\n\r\n                 _The arrivall of two Dutch Frigots._\r\n\r\nWithin a few daies after, they descried two Frigots that came close to the\r\nshore, and sent a Letter to the Governor, writ in Italian, that they were\r\nHollanders had beene in the West-Indies, and desired but to arrive,\r\nrefresh themselves with wood and water, and so be gone. The Governor\r\nforthwith sent them to understand, that being there under his Majestie of\r\nEngland to command those Iles, he was to carrie himselfe a friend to his\r\nfriends, and an enemy to his enemies; if therefore he could shew a lawfull\r\nCommission for his being honestly and nobly emploied, he and his should be\r\nkindly welcome, otherwise they were to adventure at their perills. But his\r\nCommission was so good, he staied there two moneths, and was so well\r\nfitted with Oile & Bacon, they were all glad and happy of this Dutch\r\nCaptaine Scoutans arrivall, with many thanks to their old friend Captaine\r\nPowell that had conducted him thither: the Colony being exceedingly in\r\ngreat want and distresse, bought the most part of it at reasonable rates,\r\nso Captaine Scoutan returned to the West-Indies, and Captaine Powell for\r\nhis part in the Low-Countries. Whilest these things were in action, the\r\nAdventurers in England made many a long looke for their ships; at last the\r\nGarland brought them all the newes, but the Tobacco was so spoiled either\r\nin the leaking ship, or the making up, it caused a great suspicion there\r\ncould none was good come from those Iles; where (were they but perfit in\r\nthe cure) questionlesse it would be much better then a great quantitie of\r\nthat they sell for Verinas, and many a thousand of it in London hath beene\r\nbought and sold by that title.\r\n\r\n               _The differences betwixt the Ministers._\r\n\r\nThe Governor being cleere of those distractions, falls upon the restoring\r\nof the burnt Redoubt, where he cuts out a new plat-forme, and mounts seven\r\ngreat peece of Ordnance upon new cariages of Cedar. Now amongst all those\r\ntroubles, it was not the least to bring the two Ministers to subscribe to\r\nthe Booke of Common Praier, which all the Bishops in England could not\r\ndoe. Finding it high time to attempt some conformitie, bethought himselfe\r\nof the Liturgie of Garnsey and Jarse, wherein all those particulars they\r\nso much stumbled at, were omitted. No sooner was this propounded, but it\r\nwas gladly imbraced by them both, whereupon the Governor translated it\r\nverbatim out of French into English, and caused the eldest Minister upon\r\nEaster day to begin the use thereof at S. Georges towne, where himselfe,\r\nmost of the Councell, Officers and Auditorie received the Sacrament: the\r\nwhich forme they continued during the time of his government.\r\n\r\n                   _The rebuilding the Mount._\r\n\r\nMuch about this time, in such a faire morning, that had invited many Boats\r\nfarre out to the Sea to fish, did rise such a Hericano that much\r\nindangered them all, so that one of them with two Boies were driven to Sea\r\nand never more heard of. The Ministers thus agreed, a Proclamation was\r\npublished for keeping of the Sabbath, and all the defective cariages he\r\nendevoured to have renewed, builded a small Boat of Cedar onely to goe\r\nwith Ores, to be ready upon any occasion to discover any shipping, and\r\ntooke order every Fort should have the like: Also caused numbers of Cedars\r\nto be brought from divers places in flotes, to rebuild the Mount, which\r\nwith an unspeakable toile, was raised seven foot higher then before, and a\r\nFalcon mounted at the foot, to be alwaies discharged for a warning to all\r\nthe Forts upon the discovery of any shipping, and this he called Rich\r\nMount. This exceeding toile and labour, having no Cattle but onely mens\r\nstrengths, caused many petitions [V.193.] to the Governour, that all\r\nthose generall works might cease till they had reaped their harvests, in\r\nthat they were in great distresse for victuall; which hee so well\r\nanswered, their owne shames did cause them desist from that importunity,\r\nand voluntarily performe as much as hee required.\r\n\r\n                  _The Tomb, of Sir George Summers._\r\n\r\nFinding accidentally a little crosse erected in a by place, amongst a many\r\nof bushes, understanding there was buried the heart and intrailes of Sir\r\nGeorge Summers, hee resolved to have a better memory for so worthy a\r\nSouldier, then that. So finding also a great Marble stone brought out of\r\nEngland, hee caused it by Masons to bee wrought handsomely and laid over\r\nthe place, which hee invironed with a square wall of hewen stone, Tombe\r\nlike; wherein hee caused to bee graven this Epitaph he had composed, and\r\nfixed it upon the Marble stone; and thus it was,\r\n\r\n    In the yeere 1611,\r\n    Noble Sir George Summers went hence to heaven;\r\n    Whose well tri'd worth that held him still imploid,\r\n    Gave him the knowledge of the world so wide.\r\n    Hence 't was by heavens decree, that to this place\r\n    He brought new guests, and name to mutuall grace.\r\n    At last his soule and body being to part,\r\n    He here bequeath'd his entrails and his heart.\r\n\r\n                 _Their manner of losses reformed._\r\n\r\nUpon the sixt of June began the second Assise, that reduced them to the\r\ndirect forme used in England. For besides the Governour and Councell, they\r\nhave the Bailiffes of the Tribes, in nature of the Deputy Lieutenants of\r\nthe shires in England, for to them are all precepts and warrants directed,\r\nand accordingly answered and respected; they performe also the duties of\r\nJustices of Peace, within their limits. The subordinate Officers to these\r\nin every tribe, are the Constables, Head-borowes, and Church-Wardens;\r\nthese are the triers of the Tobacco, which if they allow not to be\r\nmarchantable, is burnt: and these are the executioners of their civill and\r\npoliticke causes.\r\n\r\n                       _Martiall Officers._\r\n\r\nFor points of warre and martiall affaires, they have the Governour for\r\nLieutenant generall, the Sergeant major, Master of Ordinance, Captaines of\r\nCompanies, Captaines of Forts, with their severall officers, to traine and\r\nexercise those numbers under their charge, in martiall discipline.\r\n\r\n                     _Civill Offices and Courts._\r\n\r\nConcerning their Courts for decision of right and justice, the first,\r\nthough last in constitution, is their generall assembly; allowed by the\r\nstate in England, in the nature of a Parliament, consisting of about forty\r\npersons; viz. the Governour, the Counsell, the Bailiffes of the tribes,\r\nand two Burgesses of each tribe chosen by voyces in the tribe, besides\r\nsuch of the Clergie as the Governour thinkes most fit, to be held once a\r\nyeere, as you shal heare more thereof hereafter. The next Court is the\r\nAssise or Jayles of deliverie, held twice every yeere, in Christmas, and\r\nWhitson weeke, for all criminall offenders, and civill causes betwixt\r\nparty and party; as actions of debt, trespasse, battery, slander, and the\r\nlike: and these are determined by a Jury of twelve men, and above them is\r\nalso a grand Jury to examine matters of greater consequence. The last day\r\nof the Assise might also well be held a Court, for hearing the\r\ntransgressions in matters of contempt, mis-behaviour towards any\r\nMagistrate, riots, seditious speakers, contemners of warrants, and such\r\nlike: there are also as occasion shall require, many matters heard by the\r\nGovernor, or his Officers, and oft justice done in severall places, but\r\nthose are but as daies of hearing, and as preparatives against their\r\nCourts, &c.\r\n\r\n                        _The second Assise._\r\n\r\nAt this last Assize eighteene were arrained for criminall causes, a number\r\nvery extraordinary considering the place; but now occasioned by reason of\r\nthe hard yeere, and the store of ill chosen new commers; of these, some\r\nwere censured to the whipping post, some burned in the hand, but two were\r\ncondemned to die, yet the one was reprieved, the other hanged; this done,\r\nevery man returned to his home: many trials they made againe about the\r\nWarwicke, but to small purpose, her Ordnance being [V.194.] lashed so fast\r\nthey could not be unloosed, till the ropes and decks were rotten, yet some\r\nfew buttes of beare being flotie they got, which though it had lien six\r\nmoneths under water was very good, notwithstanding the next yeere they\r\nrecovered five peeces of Ordnance.\r\n\r\n           _A generall assemblie in manner a Parliament._\r\n\r\nUpon the first of August, according to the Companies instructions from\r\nEngland, began the generall assembly at the towne of Saint George, which\r\nwas the first these Iles ever had; consisting is is said, of the\r\nGovernour, Councell, Bailiffes, and Burgesses, and a Secretarie to whom\r\nall bils were presented, and by him openly read in the house, also a\r\nClerke to record the Acts, being thirty two in all; fifteene of which\r\nbeing sent into England, were by a generall consent received and enacted,\r\nthe titles whereof are these following: as for all the reasons for them,\r\nthey would be too tedious to recite.\r\n\r\n                          _Their Acts._\r\n\r\nThe first was against the unjust sale and letting of apprentises and other\r\nservants, and this was especially for the righting the undertakers in\r\nEngland. The second, concerning the disposing of aged, diseased, and\r\nimpotent persons, for it being considered how carelesse many are in\r\npreferring their friends, or sending sometimes any they can procure to\r\ngoe, such unserviceable people should be returned back at their charge\r\nthat sent them, rather then be burdensome to the poore Inhabitants in the\r\nIles. The third, the necessary manning the Kings Castle, being the key of\r\nthe Ile, that a garison of twelve able men should bee there alwaies\r\nresident: and 3000. eares of corne, and 1000. pounds of Tobacco payed them\r\nby the generality yeerely, as a pension. The fourth, against the making\r\nunmarchantable Tobacco, and Officers sworne to make true trials, & burne\r\nthat was naught. The fift, injoyned the erection of certaine publike\r\nbridges, and the maintenance of them. The sixt, for a continuall supply\r\nof victuall for all the Forts, to bee preserved, till some great occasion\r\nto use it. The seventh was, for two fixed dayes every yeere for the\r\nAssises. The eight, commands the making of high-waies, and prohibiting the\r\npassage over mens grounds and planted fields, as well to prevent the\r\nspoyling gardens, conveniencie to answer any alarum. The ninth, for the\r\npreserving young tortoises and birds, that were carelesly destroyed. The\r\ntenth, provided against vagabonds, & prohibited the entertainement of\r\nother mens servants. The eleventh, compelled the setting of a due quantity\r\nof corne for every family. The twelfth, the care corne being set, enjoyned\r\nthe keeping up of their poultry till it was past their reaches. The\r\nthirteenth, for the preservation of sufficient fences, & against the\r\nfelling of marked trees appointed for bounds. The fourteenth, granted to a\r\nlevy for a thousand pound weight of Tobacco, towards the payment of\r\npublike workes, as the the bridges and the mount. The fifteenth, for the\r\nenjoyning as acknowledgement and acception of all resident Governours,\r\nand the warranting him to continue, though his time be expired, till the\r\narrivall  of a legitimate successor from England, to prevent all unmeet\r\nand presumptuous elections, besides it was desired by petition in England,\r\nthe new Governour should live two months as a private man after his\r\narrivall, if his predecessor did stay so long, the better to learne and\r\nobserve his course. And these are the contents of those fifteene Acts,\r\nappplied as you may perceive: which the lawes of England could not take\r\nnotice of, because every climate hath somewhat to it selfe in that kinde\r\nin particular; for otherwise as it is conceived, it had beene a high\r\nimpudency and presumption to have medled with them, or indeed with any\r\nsuch as these lawes, that had with such great judgement and justice\r\nalwaies provided for.\r\n\r\n              _The arrivall of the Magazin ship._\r\n\r\n                70000. _weight of Tobacco._ {MN}\r\n\r\nNo sooner was this businesse over, but the Magazin ship is discovered, and\r\nthat night came into the Harbour, but in a very weake and sickly case,\r\nhaving cast over board twenty or thirty of her people, and so violent was\r\nthe infection, that the most part of the sailers, as well as passengers,\r\nwere so sicke, or dismaid, or both, that the Master confessed, had they\r\nstayed it the Sea but a weeke longer, they had all perished. There arrived\r\nwith this ship divers Gentlemen of good fashion, with their wives and\r\nfamilies; but many of them crasie by the tediousnesse of the voyage:\r\nhowsoever most of them, by the [V.195.] excellent salubrity of the aire,\r\nthen which the world hath not a better, soone after recovered; yet some\r\nthere were that died presently after they got ashore, it being certainly\r\nthe quality of the place, either to kill, or cure quickly, as the bodies\r\nare more or lesse corrupted. By this ship the Company sent a supply of ten\r\npersons for the generality, but of such bad condition that it seemed they\r\nhad picked the Males out of Newgate, the Females from Bridewell: As the\r\nGovernour found it his best course, to grant out the women to such as were\r\nso greedy of wives, and would needs have them for better for worse; and\r\nthe men hee placed in the Kings Castle for souldiers. But this bad, weake,\r\nsickly supply being dispersed for their best reliefe, by the much\r\nimployment of his Boats in remooving them, many of his owne men became\r\ninfected, so that for some weekes, they were not able to doe him any\r\nservice at all. Strict instructions also they brought for the planting of\r\nSugar canes, for which the Iland being rockie and dry, is so unproper,\r\nthat few as yet have beene seene to prosper: yet there are others hold the\r\ncontrary opinion, that there is raine so ordinarily, the Iles are so\r\nmoist as produceth all their plants in such infinit abundance: there is no\r\ngreat reason to suspect this, were it rightly used, more then the rest.\r\n{MN} Seventy thousand weight of Tobacco being prepared towards her\r\nfraught she returned for England. No sooner was shee gone then came in\r\nanother, sent by the Company and generalty, well conditioned, but shee\r\nfailed not much to have beene cast away amongst those dangerous & terrible\r\nrocks; by her came also expresse command, they should entertaine no other\r\nships, then were directly sent from the Company: this caused much\r\ngrudging, and indeed a generall distraction and exclamation among the\r\nInhabitants, to be thus constrained to buy what they wanted, and sell what\r\nthey had at what price the Magazin pleased, and to debarre true men from\r\ncomming to them for trade or reliefe, that were daily received in all the\r\nharbours in England. So long this ship stayed going for fraught and wages,\r\nthe Master not caring how long he lay at that rate in a good harbour, the\r\nGovernour was ready to send her away by Proclamation. Thus ended the first\r\nyeere of the government of C. Butler.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               A.D. 1620.\r\n\r\n           _The building of three bridges and other works._\r\n\r\nWith the first of the second yeere were held the Assises, where all the\r\nBailiffes were fined for not giving a beginning to the building of the\r\nbridges; there was also an order to restraine the excessive wages all\r\nhandicrafts men would have: and that the Church-wardens should meet twice\r\na yeere, to have all their presentments made perfect against the Assises.\r\nThe Assises done, all the ablest men were trained in their armes, and then\r\ndeparted to their owne homes. The towne thus cleered, he made certaine new\r\ncarriages for some demy Culverings, and a large new store-house of Cedar\r\nfor the yeerely Magazines goods; finished Warwicks Fort begun by Master\r\nMore, and made a new platforme at Pagits Fort, also a faire house of lime\r\nand stone for the Townes-house. The three bridges appointed by the\r\ngenerall assembly, was followed with such diligence, though they were more\r\nthen an hundred, or an hundred and twenty foot in length, having the\r\nfoundation and arches in the Sea, were raised and accomplished, so that\r\nman or beast with facility might passe them.\r\n\r\n             _The generall Assises, and the proceedings._\r\n\r\nAt Whitsonday was held the fourth generall Assise at Saint Georges, where\r\nwere tryed twenty severall causes; foure or five were whipped or burnt in\r\nthe hand, for breaking of houses: also an order was made, that the party\r\ncast in the triall of any cause, should pay to every of the Jurours foure\r\npence: moreover, that not past ten leaves at the most should grow upon a\r\nplant of Tobacco, and that also in the making it up, a distinction should\r\ndiligently be observed of two kinds, a better and a worse: then they built\r\na strong stone house for the Captaine of the Kings Castle and corps du\r\nguard; and repaired what defects they could finde in the platformes and\r\ncarriages.\r\n\r\nCaptaine Powell so oft mentioned, having beene in the West-Indies for the\r\nStates of Holland, came to an anchor within shot of their Ordnance,\r\ndesiring admittance for wood and water, of which hee had great need, but\r\nthe Governor would not permit him, so he weighed and [V.196.] departed,\r\nwhereat the company were so madded, it was not possible to constraine them\r\nto cease their exclaimations against the Companies inhibition, till they\r\nwere weary with exclaming: But still for their better defence, not\r\nthinking themselves sufficiently secure, having finished two new\r\nplat-formes more, arrived the Magazin ship, but her Master was dead, and\r\nmany of the Passengers, the rest for most part very sicke; and withall, a\r\nstrange and wonderfull report of much complaint made against the Governor\r\nto the Company in England, by some of them returned in the last yeeres\r\nshipping: but it was eight daies before she could get in by reason of ill\r\nweather, being forced againe to Sea; so that time, they kept every night\r\ncontinually great fires, she might see the Ile as well by night as day;\r\nbut at last she arrived, and he plainly understood, he had more cause a\r\ngreat deale to looke for misconstruction of all his service then an\r\nacknowledgment, much lesse a recompence any better then his predecessors;\r\nbut it is no new thing to requite the best desert with the most vildest of\r\ningratitude.\r\n\r\n               _A strange deliverence of a Spanish wracke._\r\n\r\nThe very next daies night after the arrivall of the Magazins ship, newes\r\nwas brought the Governor by a dismaied Messenger from Sands his Tribe,\r\nthat one hundred Spaniards were landed in that part, and divers ships\r\ndiscovered at Sea, whereupon he presently manned the Forts, and instantly\r\nmade thitherward in person with twentie men, determining as he found cause\r\nto draw together more strength by the way. Being got thither by the\r\nbreake of the next day, in stead of an enemy which he expected, he met\r\nonely with a company of poore distressed Portugals and Spaniards, who in\r\ntheir passage from Carthagena in the West-Indies, in consort with the\r\nSpanish fleet of Plait; by the same storme that had indangered the Magazin\r\nship, lost theirs upon those terrible Rocks, being to the number of\r\nseventy persons, were strangely preserved; and the manner was thus.\r\n\r\nAbout Sunne-set their ship beating amongst the Rocks, some twenty of the\r\nSailers got into the Boat with what treasure they could, leaving the\r\nCaptaine, the Master, and all the rest to the mercy of the Sea. But a Boy\r\nnot past foureteene yeares of age that leaped after to have got into the\r\nBoat, missing that hope, it pleased God he got upon a Chest a drift by\r\nhim, whereon they report he continued two daies, and was driven neere to\r\nthe cleane contrary part of the Ile, where he was taken up neere dead, yet\r\nwell recovered. All this night the ship sticking fast, the poore\r\ndistressed in her the next day spying land, made a raft, and were those\r\ngave the alarum first a shore about three of the clocke in the afternoone.\r\nThe morning after, about seven of the clocke came in the Boat to a place\r\ncalled Mangrove Bay; and the same day their Carpenter was driven a shore\r\nupon a Planke neere Hog-Bay. There was a Gentlewoman that had stood wet up\r\nto the middle upon the raft from the ship to the shore, being big with\r\nchilde; and although this was upon the thirteenth of September, she tooke\r\nno hurt, and was safely delivered of a Boy within three daies after. The\r\nbest comfort could be given them in those extremities they had, although\r\nsome of the baser sort had beene rifling some of them before the Governors\r\narrivall; Also the Spanish Captaine and the chiefe with him, much\r\ncomplained of the treachery of his men to leave him in that manner, yet\r\nhad conveyed with them the most of the money they could come by, which he\r\neasily missed; whereupon hee suddenly caused all them he accused, to be\r\nsearched, and recovered to the value of one hundred and fortie pounds\r\nstarling, which he delivered into the Captaines hands, to be imploied in a\r\ngenerall purse towards their generall charge: during their stay in the\r\nIles, some of the better sort, nine or ten weeks dieted at his owne table,\r\nthe rest were billited amongst the Inhabitants at foure shillings the\r\nweeke, till they found shipping for their passage, for which they paied\r\nno more then the English paied themselves; and for the passage of divers\r\nof them, the Governor was glad to stand bound to the Master; some others\r\nthat were not able to procure such friendship, were so constrained to stay\r\nin the Iles, till by their labours they [V.197.] had got so much as would\r\ntransport them; and thus they were preserved, releeved, and delivered.\r\n\r\n               _How they solemnized the powder treason,\r\n                     and the arrival of two ships._\r\n\r\nIn the moneth insuing arrived the second ship, and she also had lost her\r\nMaster, and divers of her Passengers; in her came two Virginian Women to\r\nbe married to some would have them, that after they were converted and had\r\nchildren, they might be sent to their Countrey and kindred to civilize\r\nthem. Towards the end of this moneth came in the third ship with a small\r\nMagazin, having sold what she could, caried the rest to Virginia, and\r\nnever did any of those Passengers complaine either of their good diet, or\r\ntoo good usage at sea; but the cleane contrary still occasioned many of\r\nthose extremities. The fift of November the damnable plot of the powder\r\ntreason was solemnized, with Praiers, Sermons, and a great Feast, whereto\r\nthe Governor invited the chiefe of the Spaniards, where drinking the Kings\r\nhealth, it was honored with a quicke volly of small shot, which was\r\nanswered from the Forts with the great Ordnance, and then againe concluded\r\nwith a second volley of small shot; neither was the afternoone without\r\nmusicke and dancing, and at night many huge bone-fires of sweet wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              A.D. 1621.\r\n\r\n            _The Spaniards returne, and in danger againe._\r\n\r\n         _The English Murderers found in the Spanish wracke._ {MN}\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards to expresse their thankfulnesse at their departure, made a\r\ndeed of gift to the Governor of whatsoever he could recover of the wracked\r\nship; but the ships as they went out came so dangerously upon a Rock, that\r\nthe poore Spaniards were so dismaied, swearing this place was ominous unto\r\nthem, especially the women, that desired rather to goe a shore and die\r\nhowsoever, than adventure any further in such a labyrinth of dangers, but\r\nat last she got cleere without danger, and well to England; the other went\r\nto Virginia, wherein the Governor sent two great Chests filled with all\r\nsuch kinds and sorts of Fruits and Plants as their Ilands had; as Figs,\r\nPomgranats, Oranges, Lemons, Sugar-canes, Plantanes, Potatoes, Papawes,\r\nCassado roots, red Pepper, the Prickell Peare, and the like. The ships\r\nthus dispatched, hee goeth into the maine, and so out to sea to the\r\nSpanish wracke. He had beene there before presently after her ruine, for\r\nnever had ship a more sudden death, being now split in peeces all under\r\nwater. He found small hope to recover any thing, save a Cable and an\r\nAnchor, and two good Sacars; {MN} but the wind was so high hee was forced\r\nto returne, being ten miles from the shore, onely with three Murderers,\r\nwhich were knowne to be the same Captaine Kendall had sold to Captaine\r\nKerby, whose ship was taken by two men of warre of Carthagena, the most of\r\nhis men slaine or hanged, and he being wounded, died in the woods. Now\r\ntheir Pilot being at this service, got thus those three Murderers to their\r\nship, and their ship thus to the Bermudas, as the Spaniards remaining\r\nrelated to the Governor and others.\r\n\r\n                _Their Aisses, and other passages._\r\n\r\nHaving raised three small Bulwarkes at Southhamptons Fort, with two\r\nCurtaines, and two Ravilings, which indeed is onely the true absolute\r\npeece of fortification in the Iles; Christmas being come, and the prefixed\r\nday of the Assise; divers were whipped and burnt in the hand, onely three\r\nyoung boyes for stealing were condemned, and at the very point of hanging\r\nreprived. The Governour then sent his Lieutenant all over the maine to\r\ndistribute Armes, to those were found most fit to use them, & to give\r\norder for their randezvous, which were hanged up in the Church. About this\r\ntime it chanced a pretty secret to be discovered to preserve their corne\r\nfrom the fly, or weavell, which did in a manner as much hurt as the rats.\r\nFor the yeere before having made a Proclamation that all Corne should be\r\ngathered by a certaine day, because many lazy persons ranne so after the\r\nships to get Beere and Aquavitae, for which they will give any thing they\r\nhave, much had beene lost for want of gathering. This yeare having a very\r\nfaire crop, some of the Inhabitants, none of the best husbands, hastily\r\ngathered it for feare of the penaltie, threw it in great heaps into their\r\nhouses unhusked, and so let it lie foure or five moneths, which was\r\nthought would have spoiled it: where the good husbands husked it, and with\r\nmuch labour hung it up, where the Flies did so blow on it, they increased\r\n[V.198.] to so many Weavels, they generally complained of great losse; but\r\nthose good fellowes that never cared but from hand to mouth, made their\r\nboasts, that not a graine of theirs had beene touched nor hurt, there\r\nbeing no better way to preserve it then by letting it lie in its huske,\r\nand spare an infinite labour formerly had beene used. There were also very\r\nluckily about this time found out divers places of fresh water, of which\r\nmany of the Forts were very destitute, and the Church-wardens and\r\nSide-men were very busie in correcting the prophaners of the Sabbath,\r\nDrunkards, Gamesters, and such like. There came also from Virginia a small\r\nBarke with many thanks for the presents sent them; much Aquavitae, Oile,\r\nSacke and Bricks they brought in exchange of more Fruits and Plants,\r\nDucks, Turkies and Limestone, of which she had plenty, and so returned.\r\nDuring the aboad of the stay of this ship, the mariage of one of the\r\nVirginia maides was consummated with a husband fit for her, attended with\r\nmore then one hundred guests, and all the dainties for their dinner could\r\nbe provided; they made also another triall to fish for Whales, but it\r\ntooke no more effect then the former: this was done by the Master of the\r\nVirginia ship that professed much skill that way, but having fraughted his\r\nship with Lime-stone, with 20000. weight of Potatoes, and such things as\r\nhe desired, returned for Virginia.\r\n\r\n                      _A strange Sodomy._\r\n\r\n            _More trialls about the wracks._ {MN}\r\n\r\nAprill and May were spent in building a strong new prison, and perfecting\r\nsome of the Fortifications, and by the labour of twenty men in fourteene\r\ndaies was got from the Spanish wracke foure excellent good Sacres, and\r\nmounted them at the Forts. Then began the generall Assize, where not fewer\r\nthen fifty civill, or rather uncivill actions were handled, and twenty\r\ncriminall prisoners brought to the bar; such a multitude of such vild\r\npeople were sent to this Plantation, that he thought himselfe happy his\r\ntime was so neere expired: three of the foulest acts were these: the first\r\nfor the rape of a married woman, which was acquitted by a senselesse Jury;\r\nthe second for buggering a Sow, and the third for Sodomy with a boy, for\r\nwhich they were hanged; during the time of the imprisonment of this\r\nBuggerer of the Sow, a Dung-hill Cocke belonging to the same man did\r\ncontinually haunt a Pigge of his also, and to the wonder of all them that\r\nsaw it who were many, did so frequently tread the Pigge as if it had beene\r\none of his Hens, that the Pigge languished and died within a while after,\r\nand then the Cocke resorted to the very same Sow (that this fellow was\r\naccused for) in the very same manner; and as an addition to all this,\r\nabout the same time two Chickens were hatched, the one whereof had two\r\nheads, the other crowed very loud and lustily within twelve houres after\r\nit was out of the shell. A desperate fellow being to bee arraigned for\r\nstealing a Turky, rather then he would endure his triall, secretly\r\nconveighed himselfe to Sea in a little Boat, and never since was ever\r\nheard of, nor is he ever like to be, without an exceeding wonder, little\r\nlesse then a miracle. {MN} In June they made another triall about the\r\nSpanish wracke, and recovered another Sacre and a Murderer, also he caused\r\nto be hewed out of the maine Rocke a paire of large staires for the\r\nconvenient landing of goods and passengers, a worke much to the beauty and\r\nbenefit of the towne. With twenty chosen men, and two excellent Divers,\r\nthe Governour went himselfe to the wracke Warwick, but they could recover\r\nbut one Murderer, from thence he went to the Sea-adventure, the wracke of\r\nSir George Summers, the hull though two or three fathomes in the water,\r\nthey found unperished and with much a doe weighed a Sacre, her sheat\r\nAnchor, divers barres of Iron and pigs of Lead, which stood the Plantation\r\nin very great stead. Towards the end of July he went to seeke for a\r\nwracke they reported lay under water with her hatches spiked up, but they\r\ncould not finde her, but from the Spanish wracke lay there by they weighed\r\nthree faire Sacres more, and so returned through the Tribes to Saint\r\nGeorges: some were also imployed to seeke out beds of Oisters for Pearle,\r\nsome they found, some seed Pearle they got, but out of one little shell\r\nabove all the rest they got about 120. small Pearle, but somewhat\r\ndefective in their colour.\r\n\r\n                   _The Planters complaints._ {MN}\r\n\r\n[V.199.] The time of Captain Butlers government drawing neere an end, the\r\nColony presented unto him divers grievances, to intreat him to remember to\r\nthe Lords and Company in England at his returne: also they appointed two\r\nto be joyned with him, with letters of credence to solicit in their\r\nbehalfe those grievances following: {MN} First, they The Planters were\r\ndefrauded of the food of their soules: for being not fewer then one\r\nthousand and five hundred people, dispersed in length twenty miles, they\r\nhad at that present but one Minister, nor never had but two, and they so\r\nshortned of their promises, that but onely for meere pity they would have\r\nforsaken them. Secondly, neglected in the safety of their lives by wants\r\nof all sorts of munition. Thirdly, they had beene censured contrary to his\r\nMajesties Lawes, and not allowed them the benefit of their booke as they\r\nare in England, but by Captaine Butler. Fourthly, they were frustrated of\r\nmany of their covenants, and most extremely pinched and undone by the\r\nextortion of the Magazine, for although their Tobacco was stinted but at\r\ntwo shillings sixpence the pound, yet they pitched their commodities at\r\nwhat rate they pleased. Fifthly, their fatherlesse children are left in\r\nlittle better condition then slaves, for if their Parents die in debt,\r\ntheir children are made as bondmen till the debt be discharged: these\r\nthings being perfected, there grew a great question of one Heriot for\r\nplotting of factions and abusing the Governour, for which he was condemned\r\nto lose his eares, yet he was used so favourably he lost but the part of\r\none in all.\r\n\r\n                     _The returne of Captaine Butler._\r\n\r\nBy this time it being growne past the wonted season of the comming in of\r\nships from England, after a generall longing and expectation, especially\r\nof the Governour, whose Commission being neere upon expiration, gave him\r\ncause to wish for a meane of deliverance from so troublesome and\r\nthanklesse an imploiment as he had hitherto found it; a saile is\r\ndiscovered, and long it was not before shee arrived in the Kings\r\nCastle-Harbour: this Barke was set out by two or three private men of the\r\nCompany, and having landed her supplies, was to goe for Virginia; by her\r\nthe Governour received certaine advertisements of the carriage and\r\nbehaviour of the Spaniards, which he had relieved as you have heard the\r\nyeere before; that quite contrary both to his merit, their vow, and his\r\nowne expectation, they made clamours against him, the which being seconded\r\nby the Spanish Ambassadour, caused the State to fall in examination about\r\nit; whereupon having fully cleared their ingratefulnesse and impudency,\r\nand being assured of the choice of a successor that was to be expected\r\nwithin five or six weekes; hee was desirous to take the opportunity of\r\nthis Barke, and to visit the Colony in Virginia in his returne for\r\nEngland: leaving the government to Captaine Felgat, Captaine Stokes,\r\nMaster Lewis Hewes, Master Nedom and Master Ginner, but now his time being\r\nfully expired, and the fortifications finished, viz. The Kings Castle\r\nwherein were mounted upon sufficient Platformes sixteene peece of\r\nOrdnances: In Charles Fort two; In Southampton Fort five, betwixt which\r\nand the Castle passeth the Chanell into the Harbour, secured by three and\r\ntwenty peeces of good artillery to play upon it. In Cowpers Ile is\r\nPembrocks Fort, where is two Peeces. The Chanell of Saint George is\r\nguarded by Smiths Fort, and Pagits Fort, in which is eleven peece of\r\nOrdnance. Saint George towne is halfe a league within the Harbour,\r\ncommanded by Warwicks Fort, where are three great Peeces, and on the\r\nWharfe before the Governours house eight more, besides the warning Peece\r\nby the mount, and three in Saint Katharines; so that in all there are ten\r\nFortresses and two and fifty peeces of Ordnance sufficient and\r\nserviceable: their formes and situations you may see more plainlier\r\ndescribed in the Map; and to defend those, he left one thousand five\r\nhundred persons with neere a hundred boats, and the Ile well replenished\r\nwith store of such fruits, provisions and Poultry, as is formerly related;\r\nyet for so departing and other occasions, much difference hath beene\r\nbetwixt him and some of the Company, as any of his Predecessors, which I\r\nrather wish were reconciled, then to be a reporter of such unprofitable\r\ndissentions.\r\n\r\n [V.200]                     For\r\n\r\n    Till trechery and faction, and avarice be gone,\r\n    Till envy and ambition, and backbiting be none,\r\n    Till perjury and idlenesse, and injury be out,\r\n    And truly till that villany the worst of all that rout;\r\n    Unlesse those vises banisht be, what ever Forts you have,\r\n    A hundred walls together put will not have power to save.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           A.D. 1622.\r\n                 _The Lord Cavendish Treasurer,\r\n                 Master Nicholas Farrar Deputy._\r\n\r\n\r\n            Master John Barnard sent to be Governour.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo supply this place was sent by the noble adventurers John Bernard, a\r\nGentleman both of good meanes and quality, who arrived within eight daies\r\nafter Butlers departure with two ships, and about one hundred and forty\r\npassengers with armes and all sorts of munition and other provisions\r\nsufficient. During the time of his life which was but six weekes in\r\nreforming all things he found defective, he shewed himselfe so judiciall\r\nand industrious as gave great satisfaction, and did generally promise vice\r\nwas in great danger to be suppressed, and vertue and the Plantation much\r\nadvanced; but so it hapned that both he and his wife died in such short\r\ntime they were both buried in one day and one grave, and Master John\r\nHarrison chosen Governour till further order came from England.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               A.D. 1623.\r\n                     _Sir Edward Sackvil Treasurer,\r\n                     Master Gabriel Barber Deputy._\r\n\r\n\r\n                     What hapned in the government of\r\n                             Master John Harrison.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey are still much troubled with a great short worme that devours their\r\nPlants in the night, but all the day they lie hid in the ground, and\r\nthough early in the morning they kill so many, they would thinke there\r\nwere no more, yet the next morning you shall finde as many. The\r\nCaterpillars to their fruits are also as pernicious, and the land Crabs in\r\nsome places are as thicke in their Borowes as Conies in a Warren, and doe\r\nmuch hurt; besides all this, there hapned this yeere a very heavy\r\ndisaster, for a ship wherein there had beene much swearing and blaspheming\r\nused all the voyage, and landed what she had to leave in those Iles,\r\njovially froliking in their Cups and Tobacco, by accident fired the\r\nPowder, that at the very instant blew up the great Cabin, and some one way\r\nand some another, it is a wonder to thinke how they could bee so blowne\r\nout of the gun-roome into the Sea, where some were taken up living, so\r\npitifully burned, their lives were worse then so many deaths, some died,\r\nsome lived, but eighteene were lost at this fatall blast, the ship also\r\nimmediatly sunke with threescore barrels of meale sent for Virginia, and\r\nall the other provision in her was thus lost.\r\n\r\n                                _Note._\r\n\r\n                               A.D.  1624.\r\n                     _Sir Thomas Smith treasurer,\r\n                     Master Edwards Deputy._ {MN}\r\n\r\nNow to consider how the Spaniards, French, and Dutch, have beene lost and\r\npreserved in those invincible Iles, yet never regarded them but as\r\nmonuments of miseries, though at this present they all desire them; How\r\nSir Thomas Gates, and Sir George Summers being ready to sinke in the sea\r\nwere saved, what an incredible abundance of victuall they found, how it\r\nwas first planted by the English, the strange increase of Rats, and their\r\nsudden departure, the five men came from England in a boat, the escape of\r\nHilliard, and the rest of those accidents there hapned, a man would\r\nthinke it a tabernacle of miracles, and the worlds wonder, that from such\r\na Paradise of admiration who would thinke should spring such wonders of\r\nafflictions as are onely fit to be sacrificed upon the highest altars of\r\nsorrow, thus to be set upon the highest Pinacles of content, and presently\r\nthrowne downe to the lowest degree of extremity, as you see have beene\r\nthe yeerely succeedings of those Plantations; the which to overcome, as it\r\nis an incomparable honour, so it can be no dishonour if a man doe miscarry\r\nby unfortunate accidents in such honourable actions, the which renowne\r\nand vertue to attaine hath caused so many attempts by divers Nations\r\nbesides ours, even to passe through the very amazement of adventures. Upon\r\nthe relation of this newes the Company hath sent one Captaine Woodhouse,\r\na Gentleman of good repute and great experience in the warres, and no\r\nlesse provident then industrious and valiant: then returned report, all\r\ngoeth well there. It is too true, in the absence of the noble Treasurer,\r\nSir Edward Sackvill, now Earle of Dorset, there have beene such complaints\r\nbetwixt the Planters and the Company, {MN} that by command the Lords\r\nappointed Sir Thomas Smith againe Treasurer, that since then according to\r\ntheir order of Court he is also elected, where now we must leave them all\r\nto their good fortune and successe, till we heare further of their\r\nfortunate proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 FINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            END OF VOLUME I.",
