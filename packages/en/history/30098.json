Biographical catalogues there are in plenty, but\r\nthese, though useful for reference, say little to readers who are not\r\nalready acquainted with the painters whose career and works are briefly\r\nrecorded. \"Lives\" of individual masters abound, but however excellent\r\nand essential these may be to an advanced study of the school, the\r\nvolumes containing them make too large a library to be easily carried\r\nabout, and a great deal of reading and assimilation is required to set\r\neach painter in his place in the long story. Crowe and Cavalcaselle's\r\n_History of Painting in North Italy_ still remains our sheet anchor; but\r\nit is lengthy, over full of detail of minor painters, and lacks the\r\ninteresting criticism which of late years has collected round each\r\nmaster. There seems room for a portable volume, making an attempt to\r\nconsider the Venetian painters, in relation to one another, and to help\r\nthe visitor not only to trace the evolution of the school from its dawn,\r\nthrough its full splendour and to its declining rays, but to realise\r\nwhat the Venetian School was, and what was the philosophy of life which\r\nit represented.\r\n\r\nSuch a book does not pretend to vie with, much less to supersede, the\r\nmasterly treatises on the subject which have from time to time appeared,\r\nor to take the place of exhaustive histories, such as that of Professor\r\nLeonello Venturi on the Italian primitives. It should but serve to pave\r\nthe way to deeper and more detailed reading. It does not aspire to give\r\na complete and comprehensive list of the painters; some of the minor\r\nones may not even be mentioned. The mere inclusion of names, dates, and\r\nfacts would add unduly to the size of the book, and, when without real\r\nbearing on the course of Venetian art, would have little significance.\r\nWhat the book does aim at is to enable those who care for art, but may\r\nnot have mastered its history, to rear a framework on which to found\r\ntheir own observations and appreciations; to supply that coherent\r\nknowledge which is beneficial even to a passing acquaintance with\r\nbeautiful things, and to place the unscientific observer in a position\r\nto take greater advantage of opportunities, and to achieve a wide and\r\ninteresting outlook on that cycle of artistic apprehension which the\r\nVenetian School comprises, and which marks it as the outcome and the\r\nsymbol of a great historic age.\r\n\r\nThe works cited have been principally those with which the ordinary\r\ntraveller is likely to come into contact in the chief European\r\ngalleries, and, above all, in Venice itself. The lists do not propose to\r\nbe exhaustive, but merely indicate the principal works of the artists.\r\nThose in private galleries, unless easy of access or of first-rate\r\nimportance, are usually eliminated. It has not been thought necessary to\r\nuse profuse illustrations, as the book is intended primarily for use\r\nwhen visiting the original works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n PART I\r\n\r\n CHAPTER I                            PAGE\r\n   VENICE AND HER ART                    3\r\n\r\n CHAPTER II\r\n   PRIMITIVE ART IN VENICE              11\r\n\r\n CHAPTER III\r\n   INFLUENCES OF UMBRIA AND VERONA      21\r\n\r\n CHAPTER IV\r\n   THE SCHOOL OF MURANO                 29\r\n\r\n CHAPTER V\r\n   THE PADUAN INFLUENCE                 33\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VI\r\n   JACOPO BELLINI                       39\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VII\r\n   CARLO CRIVELLI                       44\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VIII\r\n   GENTILE BELLINI AND\r\n   ANTONELLO DA MESSINA                 48\r\n\r\n CHAPTER IX\r\n   ALVISE VIVARINI                      58\r\n\r\n CHAPTER X\r\n   CARPACCIO                            68\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XI\r\n   GIOVANNI BELLINI                     81\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XII\r\n   GIOVANNI BELLINI (_continued_)       92\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XIII\r\n   CIMA DA CONEGLIANO AND OTHER\r\n   FOLLOWERS OF BELLINI                103\r\n\r\n\r\n PART II\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XIV\r\n   GIORGIONE                           121\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XV\r\n   GIORGIONE (_continued_)             132\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XVI\r\n   THE GIORGIONESQUE                   140\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XVII\r\n   TITIAN                              144\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XVIII\r\n   TITIAN (_continued_)                157\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XIX\r\n   TITIAN (_continued_)                173\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XX\r\n   PALMA VECCHIO AND LORENZO LOTTO     184\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXI\r\n   SEBASTIAN DEL PIOMBO                198\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXII\r\n   BONIFAZIO AND PARIS BORDONE         203\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXIII\r\n   PAINTERS OF THE VENETIAN PROVINCES  212\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXIV\r\n   PAOLO VERONESE                      228\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXV\r\n   TINTORETTO                          243\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXVI\r\n   TINTORETTO (_continued_)            254\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXVII\r\n   BASSANO                             269\r\n\r\n\r\n PART III\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n   THE INTERIM                         281\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXIX\r\n   TIEPOLO                             297\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXX\r\n   PIETRO LONGHI                       309\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXI\r\n   CANALE                              314\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XXXII\r\n   FRANCESCO GUARDI                    321\r\n\r\n\r\n BIBLIOGRAPHY                          329\r\n\r\n INDEX                                 333\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BY                 AT\r\n\r\n  1.

The Venetian is the most marked and\r\nrecognisable of all the schools; its singularity is such that a novice\r\nin art can easily, in a miscellaneous collection, sort out the works\r\nbelonging to it, and added to this unique character is the position it\r\noccupies in the domain of art. Venice alone of Italian States can boast\r\nan epoch of art comparable in originality and splendour to that of her\r\ngreat Florentine rival; an epoch which is to be classed among the great\r\nart manifestations of the world, which has exerted, and continues to\r\nexert, incalculable power over painting, and which is the inspiration as\r\nwell as the despair of those who try to master its secret.\r\n\r\nThe other schools of Italy, with all their superficial varieties of\r\ntreatment and feeling, depended for their very life upon the extent to\r\nwhich they were able to imbibe the Florentine influence. Siena rejected\r\nthat strength and perished; Venice bided her time and suddenly struck\r\nout on independent lines, achieving a magnificent victory.\r\n\r\nArt in Florence made a strictly logical progress. As civilisation awoke\r\nin the old Latin race, it went back in every domain of learning to the\r\nrich subsoil which still underlay the ruin and the alien structures left\r\nby the long barbaric dominion, for the Italian in his darkest hour had\r\nnever been a barbarian; and as the mind was once more roused to\r\nconscious life, Florence entered readily upon that great intellectual\r\nmovement which she was destined to lead. Her cast of thought was, from\r\nthe first, realistic and scientific. Its whole endeavour was to know the\r\ntruth, to weigh evidences, to elaborate experiments, to see things as\r\nthey really were; and when she reached the point at which art was ready\r\nto speak, we find that the governing motive of her language was this\r\nsame predilection for reality, and it was with this meaning that her\r\ntypical artists found a voice. No artist ever sought for truth, both\r\nphysical and spiritual, more resolutely than Giotto, and none ever spoke\r\nmore distinctly the mind of his age and country; and as one generation\r\nfollows another, art in Tuscany becomes more and more closely allied to\r\nthe intellectual movement. The scientific predilection for _form_, for\r\nthe representation of things as they really are, characterises not\r\nFlorentine painting alone, but the whole of Florentine art. It is an art\r\nof contributions and discoveries, marked, it is needless to say, at\r\nevery step by dominating personalities, positively as well as relatively\r\ngreat, but with each member consciously absorbed in \"going one better\"\r\nthan his predecessors, in solving problems and in mastering methods.\r\nFlorentine art is the outcome of Florentine life and thought. It is part\r\nof the definite clear-cut view of thought and reason, of that exactitude\r\nof apprehension towards which the whole Florentine mind was bent, and\r\nthe lesser tributaries, as they flowed towards her, formed themselves on\r\nher pattern and worked upon the same lines, so that they have a certain\r\ngeneral resemblance, and their excellence is in proportion to the\r\nthoroughness with which they have learned their lesson.\r\n\r\nThe difference which separates Venetian from the rest of Italian\r\npainting is a fundamental one. Venice attains to an equally\r\ndistinguished place, but the way in which she does it and the character\r\nof her contribution are both so absolutely distinct that her art seems\r\nto be the outcome of another race, with alien temperament and standards.\r\nVenice had, indeed, a history and a life of her own. Her entire\r\nisolation, from her foundation, gave her an independent government and\r\ncustoms peculiar to herself, but at the same time her people, even in\r\ntheir earliest and most precarious struggles, were no barbarians who\r\nhad slowly to acquire the arts of civilised life. Among the refugees\r\nwere persons of high birth and great traditions, and they brought with\r\nthem to the first crazy settlement on the lagoons some political\r\ntraining and some idea of how to reconstruct their shattered social\r\nfabric. The Venetian Republic rose rapidly to a position of influence\r\nin Europe. Small and circumscribed as its area was, every feature and\r\nsentiment was concentrated and intensified. But one element above all\r\npermeates it and sets it apart from other European States. The Oriental\r\nelement in Venice must never be lost sight of if we wish to understand\r\nher philosophy of art.\r\n\r\nThere are some grounds, seriously accepted by the most recent\r\nhistorians, for believing that the first Venetian colonists were the\r\ndescendants of emigrants who in prehistoric times had established\r\nthemselves in Asia and who had returned from thence to Northern Italy.\r\n\"These colonists,\" says Hazlitt, \"were called Tyrrhenians, and from\r\ntheir settlements round the mouth of the Po the Venetian stock was\r\nultimately derived.\" If the tradition has any truth, we think with a\r\ndeeper interest of that instinct for commerce which seems to have been\r\nin the very blood of the early Venetians. Did it, indeed, come down to\r\nthem from the merchants of Tyre and Carthage? From that wonderful\r\ntrading race which stretched out its arms all over Europe and\r\npenetrated even to our own island? From the first, Venice cut herself\r\nadrift, as far as possible, from Western ties, but she turned to Eastern\r\npeople and to intercourse with the East with a natural affinity which\r\nsavours of racial instinct. All her greatness was derived from her\r\nAsiatic trade, and her bazaars, heaped with Eastern riches, must have\r\nassumed a deeply Oriental aspect. Her customs long retained many details\r\npeculiar to the East. The people observed a custom for choosing and\r\ndowering brides, which was of Asia. The national treatment of women was\r\nakin to that of an Oriental State; Venetian women lived in a retirement\r\nwhich recalled the life of the harem, only appearing on great occasions\r\nto display their brocades and jewels. Girls were closely veiled when\r\nthey passed through the streets. The attachment of men to women had no\r\nintellectual bias, scarcely any sentiment, but \"went straight to the\r\nmark: the enjoyment of physical beauty.\" The position of women in Venice\r\nwas a great contrast to that attained by the Florentine lady of the\r\nRenaissance, who was highly educated, deeply versed in men and in\r\naffairs, the fine flower of culture, and the queen of a brilliant\r\nsociety. The love for colour and gorgeous pageantry was of Semitic\r\nintensity and seemed insatiable, and the gratification of the senses\r\nwas a deliberate State policy. But passionate as was the spirit of\r\npatriotism, enthusiastic the love and loyalty of the people, the civic\r\nspirit was absent. The masses were contented to live under a despotic\r\nrule and to be little despots in their own houses. In the twelfth\r\ncentury the people saw power pass into the hands of the aristocracy, and\r\nas long as the despotism was a benevolent one, the event aroused no\r\nopposition. Like Orientals, the Venetians had wild outbursts, and like\r\nthem they quieted down and nothing came of them. As Mr. Hazlitt remarks,\r\n\"their occasional resistance to tyranny, though marked by deeds of\r\nhorrid and dark cruelty, left no deep or enduring traces behind it. It\r\nestablished no principle. It taught no lesson.\" Venice was a Republic\r\nonly in name. The whole aspect of her government is Eastern. Its system\r\nof espionage, its secret tribunals, its swift and silent blows,--these\r\nare all Oriental traits, and the East entering into her whole life\r\nfrom without found a natural home awaiting it. We should be mistaken,\r\nhowever, in thinking that the Venetians in their great days were\r\nenervated and lapped in the sensuality which we are apt to associate\r\nwith Eastern ideals. Sensuality did in the end drain the life out of\r\nher. \"It is the disease which attacks sensuousness, but it is not the\r\nsame thing.\" The Venetians were by nature men with a deep capacity for\r\nfeeling, and it is this deep feeling which has so large a share in\r\nVenetian art.\r\n\r\nThe painters of Venice were of the people and had no wide intellectual\r\noutlook at its most splendid moment, such as was possessed by those men\r\nwho in Florence were drawn into the company of the Medici and their\r\ncourt of scholars, and who all their lives were in the midst of a\r\nsociety of large aims and a free public spirit, in which men took their\r\nshare of the responsibilities and honours of a citizen's life. The\r\nmerchant-patrons of Venice are quite uninterested in the solving of\r\nproblems. They pay a price, and they want a good show of colour and\r\ngilding for their money. Presently they buy from outside, and a\r\nhalf-hearted imitation of foreigners is the best ambition of Venetian\r\nartists. Art, it has been said, does not declare itself with true\r\nspontaneity till it feels behind it the weight and unanimity of the\r\nwhole body of the people. That true outburst was long in coming, but its\r\nseeds were fructifying deep in a congenial soil. They were fostered by\r\nthe warmth and colour of Oriental intercourse, and at last the racial\r\ninstinct speaks with no uncertain accent in the great domain of art, and\r\nspeaks in a new and unexpected way; as splendid as, yet utterly unlike,\r\nthe grand intellectual declaration of Florence.\r\n\r\nLet us bear in mind, then, that Venice in all her history, in all\r\nher character, is Eastern rather than Western. Hers is the kingdom\r\nof feeling rather than that of thought, of emotion as opposed to\r\nintellect. Her whole story tells of a profoundly emotional and sensuous\r\napprehension of the nature of things; and till the time comes when her\r\nartists are inspired to express that, their creations may be interesting\r\nenough, but they fail to reveal the true workings of her mind. When they\r\ndo, they find a new medium and use it in a new way. Venetian colour,\r\nwhen it comes into its kingdom, speaks for a whole people, sensuous and\r\nof deep feeling, able for the first time to utter itself in art.\r\n\r\nWe have to divide the history of the Venetian School into three parts.\r\nThe first extends from the primitives to the end of Giovanni Bellini's\r\nlife. He forms a link between the first and second periods. The second\r\nbegins with Giorgione and ends with Tintoretto and Bassano, and is the\r\nVenetian School proper. Thirdly, we have the eighteenth-century revival,\r\nin which Tiepolo is the most conspicuous figure, and which is in an\r\nequal degree the expression of the life of its time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nPRIMITIVE ART IN VENICE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe school of Byzantium, so widespread in its influence, was\r\nparticularly strong in Venice, where mosaics adorned the cathedral\r\nof Torcello from the ninth century and St. Mark's became a splendid\r\nstorehouse of Byzantine art. The earliest mosaic on the façade of St.\r\nMark's was executed about the year 1250, those in the Baptistery date\r\nduring the reign of Andrea Dandolo, who was Doge from 1342 to 1354. Yet\r\nthough the life of Giotto lies between these two dates, and his frescoes\r\nat Padua were within a few hours' journey, there is no sign that the\r\ngreat revolution in painting, which was making itself felt in every\r\nprincipal centre of Italy, had touched the richest and most peaceful of\r\nall her States.\r\n\r\nYet local art in Venice was no outcome of Byzantinism. It rose as that\r\nof the mosaicists fell, but its rise differs from that of Florence and\r\nSiena in being for long almost imperceptible. Artists were looked upon\r\nmerely as artisans in all the cities of Italy, but in Venice before any\r\nother city they had been placed among the craftsmen. The statute of the\r\nGuild of Siena was not formulated till 1355; that of Venice is the\r\nearliest of which we have any record, and bears the date of 1272. There\r\nis scarcely a word to indicate that pictures in the modern sense of the\r\nterm existed. Painters were employed on the adornment of arms and of\r\nhousehold furniture. Leather helmets and shields were painted, and such\r\nbanners as we see in Paolo Uccello's battlepieces. Painted chests and\r\n_cassoni_ were already in demand, dishes and plates for the table and\r\nthe surface of the table itself were treated in a similar way. Special\r\nregulations dealt with all these, and it is only at the end of the list\r\nthat anconæ are mentioned. The ancona was a gilded framework, having a\r\ncompartment containing a picture of the Madonna and Child, and others\r\nwith single figures of the saints, and these were the only pictures\r\nproper produced at this date. The demand for anconæ was, however, large,\r\nand they were very early placed, not only in the churches, but in the\r\nhouses of patricians and burghers. Constant disputes arose between the\r\npainters and the gilders. Pictures were habitually painted upon a gold\r\nground, but the painters were forbidden to gild the backgrounds\r\nthemselves. \"Gilding is the business of the gilder, painting that of the\r\npainter,\" says a contemporary record. \"Now the gilder contends that if\r\na frame has to be gilt and then touched with colour, he is entitled to\r\nperform both operations, but the painter disputes this right, and\r\nmaintains that the gilder should return it to him when the addition\r\nof painting is desired.\" It was, however, finally decided by law that\r\neach should exercise both professions, when one or the other played a\r\nsubordinate part in the finished work. Though the art of mosaic was\r\nfalling into decay as painting began to emerge, yet the commercial\r\nmanufactory of Byzantine Madonnas, which had been established as early\r\nas 600, went on, on the Rialto, without any variation of the traditional\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nFlorence very early discarded the temptation to cling to material\r\nsplendour, but as we pass into the Hall of the Primitives in the\r\nVenetian Academy, we see at once that Venetian art, in its earlier\r\nstages, has more to do with the gilder than the painter. The Holy\r\nPersonages are merely accessories to the gorgeous framework, the\r\nembossed ornaments, the real jewels, which were in favour with the rich\r\nand magnificent patrons. There is no sign of any feeling for painting\r\nas painting, no craving after the study of form as the outcome of\r\nintellectual activity, no zest of discovery, such as made the painter's\r\nlife in Florence an excitement in which the public shared. What little\r\nVenice imbibes of these things is from outside influence, after due\r\nlapse of time. A prosperous, luxurious city of merchants and statesmen,\r\nshe was too much bound up in the transactions and sensations of actual\r\nlife to develop any abstract and thoughtful ideals.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the first painting we can discover which shows any sign of\r\nindependent effort is the series which Paolo da Venezia painted on the\r\nback of the Pala d' Oro, over the high altar of St. Mark, when it was\r\nrestored in the fourteenth century. This reveals an artist with some\r\npictorial aptitude and one alive to the subjects that surround him. It\r\ntells the story of St. Mark's corpse transported to Venice. The first\r\npanel contains a group of cardinals of varying types and expressions; in\r\nanother the disciple listening to St. Mark's teaching, and crouching\r\nwith his elbows on his knees, has a true, natural touch. The dramatic\r\nfeeling here and there is considerable. The scene of the guards watching\r\nthe imprisoned Saint through the window and seeing the shadow of two\r\nheads, as the Saviour visits him, imparts a distinct emotion; and there\r\nis force as well as feeling for decorative composition in the panel in\r\nwhich the Saint's body lies at the feet of the sailors, while his vision\r\nappears shining upon the sails.\r\n\r\nExcept for the exaggerated insistence on the gilded elaborations of the\r\nearly ancona, there is not much to differentiate the early art of Venice\r\nfrom that of other centres; but we notice that it persevered longer in\r\nthe material and mechanical art of the craftsman. Tuscan taste made\r\nlittle impression, and many years elapsed before work akin to that of\r\nGiotto attracted attention and was admired and imitated. A man like\r\nAntonio Veneziano met with the fate of the innovator in Venice. He had\r\ntoo much of the simplicity of the Tuscan and was compelled to carry his\r\nwork to Pisa, where his naïf and humorous narratives still delight us in\r\nthe Campo Santo. It was in 1384 that he was employed to finish the\r\nfrescoes of the life of S. Ranieri, which had been left uncompleted\r\nat Andrea da Firenze's death, and the fondness for architecture and\r\nsurroundings in the Florentine taste, which secured him a welcome, may,\r\nas Vasari says, be derived from Agnolo Gaddi, who had already visited\r\nPadua and Venice.\r\n\r\nIn the last years of the fourteenth century tributary streams begin to\r\nfeed the feeble main current. In 1365 Guariento, a Paduan, was employed\r\nby the State to paint a huge fresco of Paradise in the Hall of the Gran\r\nConsiglio of the Ducal Palace. This, which lay hid for centuries under\r\nthe painting by Tintoretto, was uncovered in 1909 and found to be in\r\nfairly good preservation. It can now be seen in a side room. It tells us\r\nthat Guariento had to some extent been influenced by Giotto. The thrones\r\nhave long Gothic pendatives, the faces have more the Giottesque than the\r\nByzantine cast and show that the old traditions were crumbling.\r\n\r\nWhen painting in Venice first begins to live a life of its own,\r\nJacobello del Fiore stands out as the most conspicuous of the indigenous\r\nVenetians. His father had been president of the Painters' Guild. Jacopo\r\nhimself was president from 1415 to 1436. He was a rich and popular\r\nmember of the State and a man of high character. His works, to judge\r\nby the specimens left, hardly attained the dignity of art, though in\r\nthe banner of \"Justice,\" in the Academy, the space is filled in a\r\nmonumental fashion and the figure of St. Gabriel with the lily has\r\nsomething grand and graceful. We trace the same treatment of flying\r\nbanners and draperies and rippling hair in the fantastic but picturesque\r\nS. Grisogono in the left transept of San Trovaso. Jacobello's will,\r\nexecuted in 1439 in favour of his wife Lucia and his son, Ercole, with\r\nprovision for a possible posthumous son, shows him to have been a man of\r\nconsiderable possessions. He owned a slave and had other servants, a\r\nhouse, money, and books. Among his fellow-workers who are represented in\r\nVenice are Niccolo Semitocolo, Niccolo di Pietro, and Lorenzo Veneziano.\r\nThe important altarpiece by the last, in the Academy, has evidently been\r\nreconstructed; two Eternal Fathers hover over the Annunciation, and the\r\nSaints have been restored to the framework in such wise that the backs\r\nof many of them are turned on the momentous central event. In the\r\n\"Marriage of St. Catherine,\" in the same gallery, Lorenzo gets more\r\nnatural. The Child, in a light green dress with gold buttons, has a\r\nlively expression, and looks round at His Mother as if playing a game.\r\nThe chapel of San Tarasio in San Zaccaria contains an ancona of which\r\nthe central panel was only inserted in 1839, and is identical with\r\nLorenzo's other work. One of the finest and most elaborate of all the\r\nanconæ is in San Giovanni in Bragora, and is also the work of Lorenzo.\r\nIn this, as well as in that of San Tarasio, the Mother offers the Child\r\nthe apple, signifying the fruit of the Tree of Jesse and symbolical of\r\nthe Incarnation. This incident, which is found thus early in art, was\r\nevidently felt to raise the group of the Mother and Child from a\r\nrepresentation of a merely earthly relationship to a spiritual scene\r\nof the deepest meaning and the highest dignity.\r\n\r\nNiccolo di Pietro has several early works of the last decade of the\r\nfourteenth century, from which we gather that he began as a Byzantine,\r\nbut that he imitated Guariento and was tentatively drawn to the\r\nGiottesque movement, but not, we may remember, before Giotto had been\r\ndead for some sixty years. Niccolo di Pietro has been confounded with\r\nNiccolo Semitocolo, but it is now realised that they were two distinct\r\nmasters. The most important work of Michele Giambono which has come\r\ndown to us is the signed ancona with five saints, now in the Venetian\r\nAcademy. It is unusual to find a saint in the central panel instead of\r\nthe Madonna. The saint is on a larger scale than his companions, and has\r\nhitherto passed as the Redeemer, but Professor Venturi has identified\r\nhim as St. James the Great. He has the gold scallop-shell and pilgrim's\r\nstaff. It is clear from his size and position that the ancona has been\r\npainted for an altar specially dedicated to this Apostle.\r\n\r\nThe saints on the right are S. Michael and S. Louis of Toulouse. Between\r\nS. John the Evangelist and S. James is a monastic figure which has\r\nevidently changed places with S. John at some moment of restoration. If\r\nthe two figures are transposed, their attitudes become intelligible. S.\r\nJohn is inculcating a message inscribed in his open book, while the monk\r\nis displaying his humble answer on his own page. The use in it of the\r\nterm _servus_ suggests that he is a Servite, though the want of the\r\nnimbus precludes the idea that he is one of the founders. It is probable\r\nthat he is S. Filipo Benizzi, who, though considered as a saint from the\r\ntime of his death, was not canonised for several centuries.\r\n\r\nThe Mond Collection includes a glowing picture by Giambono; a seated\r\nfigure clad in rich vestments and holding an orb, probably representing\r\na \"Throne,\" one of the angelic orders of the celestial Hierarchy.[1]\r\n\r\n [1] These interesting particulars are given by Mr. G. M'N.\r\n Rushforth in the _Burlington Magazine_ for October 1911.\r\n\r\nWorks are still in existence which may be ascribed to one or other of\r\nthese masters, or of which no attribution can be made, but we know\r\nnothing positive of any other artists of the time which preceded the\r\ninfluence of Gentile da Fabriano. Nothing leads us to suppose that the\r\nVenetian School in its origin had any pretension to be a school of\r\ncolour, or that it could claim anything like real excellence at a time\r\nwhen the Republic first became alive to the movement which was going on\r\nin other parts of Italy, and decided to call in foreign talent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\r\n\r\n _Paolo da Venezia._\r\n\r\n Venice.

He had\r\nreceived his art education in Florence, and he brought with him fresh\r\nand delicate devices for the enrichment of painting with gold, which,\r\nderived as it was from the Sienese assimilation of Byzantine methods,\r\nwas very superior in fancy and refinement to anything that Venice had\r\nto show. He was a man of a gentle, mystic temperament, but he was\r\naccustomed to courts, and a finished master whose technique and artistic\r\nvalue was far beyond anything that the local painters were capable of.\r\nHe spent some years in Venice, adorning the great hall with episodes\r\nfrom the legend of Barbarossa; one of these, which is specially cited,\r\nwas of the battle between the Emperor and the Venetians. Gentile was\r\nworking till about 1414, and the walls, finished by Pisanello, were\r\ncovered by 1416. After this Gentile remained some time in Bergamo and\r\nBrescia, and settled in Florence about 1422. The year after reaching\r\nFlorence, he painted the famous \"Adoration of the Magi,\" now in the\r\nFlorentine Academy. Even after leaving Venice his fame survived;\r\npictures went from his workshop in the Popolo S. Trinità, and he sent\r\nback two portraits after he had returned to his native Fabriano.\r\n\r\nWe have no positive record of Gentile and Vittore Pisano, commonly\r\ncalled Pisanello, having met in Venice, but there is every evidence in\r\ntheir work that they did so, and that one overlapped the other in the\r\npaintings for the Ducal Palace.\r\n\r\nThe School of Verona already had an honourable record, and its Guild\r\ndates from 1303. The following are its rules, the document of which is\r\nstill preserved, while that of Venice has been lost:\r\n\r\n     RULES OF THE VERONESE GUILD (_abridged_)\r\n\r\n     1. No one to become a member who had not practised art for\r\n        twelve years.\r\n\r\n     2. Twelve artists to be elected members.\r\n\r\n     3. The reception of a new member depends on his being a senior.\r\n\r\n     4. The members are obliged in the winter season to take upon\r\n        themselves the instruction of all the pupils in turn.\r\n\r\n     5. A member is liable to be expelled for theft.\r\n\r\n     6. Each member is bound to extend to another fraternal\r\n        assistance in necessity.\r\n\r\n     7. To maintain general agreement in any controversies.\r\n\r\n     8. To extend hospitality to strange artists.\r\n\r\n     9. To offer to one another reciprocal comfort.\r\n\r\n    10. To follow the funerals of members with torches.\r\n\r\n    11. The President is to exercise reference authority.\r\n\r\n    12. The member who has the longest membership to be President.\r\n\r\nThere were also by-laws, which provided that no master should accept\r\na pupil for less than three years, and this acceptance had to be\r\ndefinitely registered by the public notary, a son, brother, grandson, or\r\nnephew being the only exceptions. No master might receive an apprentice\r\nwho should have left another master before his time was out, unless with\r\nthat master's free consent. There were penalties for enticing away a\r\npupil, and others to be enforced against pupils who broke the agreement.\r\nSevere restrictions existed with regard to the sale of pictures, no one\r\nbut a member of the Guild being allowed to sell them. No one might bring\r\na work from any foreign place for purposes of sale. It might not\r\neven be brought to the town without the special permission of the\r\n_Gastaldiones_, or trustees of the Guild, and those trustees were\r\npermitted to search for and destroy forged pictures. Every painter,\r\ntherefore, had to subordinate his interests and inclinations to the\r\nlocal school. It helps us to understand why the individual character of\r\nthe different masters is so perceptible, and one of the primary causes\r\nof this must have been the careful training of the pupils in the\r\nmaster's workshop.\r\n\r\nThe fresco left by Altichiero, Pisanello's first master, in the Church\r\nof S. Anastasia in Verona, shows how worthily a Veronese painter was at\r\nthis early time following in the footsteps of Giotto. Three knights of\r\nthe Cavalli family are presented by their patron saints to the Madonna.\r\nThe composition has a large simplicity, a breadth of feeling which is\r\ncarried into each gesture. The knights with their raised helmets, in the\r\npattern of horses' heads, are full of reality, the Madonna is sweet and\r\ndignified, and the saints are grand and stately. The picture has a\r\ndelightful suavity and ease, and the colouring has evidently been\r\nlovely. The setting is in good proportion and more satisfactory than\r\nthat of the Giottesques. From the series of frescoes in S. Antonio,\r\nVerona, we gather that while Venice was still limited to stiff anconæ,\r\nthe Veronese masters were managing crowds of figures and rendering\r\ndistances successfully. Altichiero puts in homely touches from everyday\r\nlife with a freedom which shows he has not yet mastered the principles\r\nof selection or the dignified fitness which guided the great masters;\r\nas, for instance, in the case of the old woman, among the spectators of\r\nthe Crucifixion, who shows her grief by blowing her nose. He lets\r\nhimself be drawn off by all manner of trivial detail and of gay costume;\r\nbut again in such frescoes as S. Lucia, or the \"Beheading of St.\r\nGeorge,\" in the Paduan chapel of the Santo, he proves how well he\r\nunderstands the force of solid, simply-draped figures, direct in gesture\r\nand expression, while the decorative use he makes of lances against the\r\nbackground was long afterwards perhaps imitated, but hardly surpassed,\r\nby Tintoretto.\r\n\r\nPisanello, who followed quickly upon Altichiero and his assistant,\r\nAvanzi, exhibits the same chivalresque and courtly inclinations which\r\ncommended Gentile da Fabriano to the splendour-loving Venetians. Verona,\r\nunder the peaceful but gallant government of the Scaligeri, had long\r\nbeen the home of all knightly lore, and the artists had been employed to\r\ndecorate chapels for the families of the great nobles. Among these,\r\nPisanello had attained a high place. Though very few of his paintings\r\nremain, they all show these influences, and his subtly modelled medals\r\nestablish him as a master of the most finished type. A much destroyed\r\nfresco in S. Anastasia, Verona, portrays the history of St. George and\r\nthe Dragon. In the St. George we probably see the portrait of the great\r\npersonage in whose honour the fresco was painted. He is mounting his\r\nhorse, which, seen from behind, reminds us of the fore-shortened\r\nchargers of Paolo Uccello. The rescued princess, also a portrait, wears\r\na magnificent dress and an elaborate headgear in the fashion of the day.\r\nOther horses, fiery and spirited, are grouped around, and in the band\r\nof cavaliers, beyond St. George, every head is individualised; one is\r\nbeautiful, another brutal, and so on through the seven. A greyhound\r\nand spaniel in the foreground are superbly painted, the background is\r\nexcellent, and a realistic touch is given by the corpses which dangle\r\nunheeded from the trees outside the castle-gate. A ruined, but\r\nfortunately not restored, \"Annunciation\" in S. Fermo, has a simple,\r\nslender figure of the Virgin sitting by her white bed, and the angel,\r\nwith great sweeping, rushing wings and bowed, child-like head with fair\r\nhair, is a most sweet and keen figure, thrilling and convincing, in\r\ncontrast to all the dead, over-worked frescoes round the church. All\r\nthese paintings are too small to be the least effective at the height\r\nat which they are placed, and can only be seen with a good glass.\r\nPisanello's art is not well adapted to wide, frescoed walls, and he\r\nseems to have enjoyed painting miniature panels, such as the two we\r\npossess. In these he is full of originality, and shows his love for the\r\nknightly life, the life of courts, in the armed _cap-à-pied_ figure of\r\nSt. George, whose point-device armour is crowned by a wide Tuscan hat\r\nand feather. The artist's knowledge and love of animals and wild nature\r\ncomes out in them, and his interest in beauty and chivalry as opposed to\r\nthe outworn conventionalities of ecclesiastic demands.\r\n\r\nWe shall be able to trace the influence of both the Umbrian and the\r\nVeronese painter on men like Antonio di Murano and Jacopo Bellini, and\r\nit is important to note the likeness of the two to one another. In\r\nGentile's \"Adoration\" we have on the one hand the Holy Family and the\r\ngay pageant of the kings, of which we could find the prototype in many\r\nan Umbrian panel. On the other we see those contrasting elements which\r\nwere struggling in Pisanello; the delight in flowers and animals, in\r\ngaily apparelled figures, in dogs and horses. The two have no lasting\r\neffect, but though they created no actual school, they gave a stimulus\r\nto Venetian art, and started it on a new tack, enabling it to open its\r\nchannels to fresh ideas. During the time they were in Venice, Jacobello\r\ndel Fiore shows some signs of adapting the new fashion to his early\r\nstyle, and the horse of S. Grisogono is very like that of Gentile in the\r\n\"Adoration,\" or like Pisano's horses. Michele Giambono is actually found\r\nin collaboration, in the chapel of the Madonna da Mascoli in St. Mark's,\r\nwith such a virile painter as the Florentine, Andrea del Castagno, who\r\nis evidently responsible for God the Father and two of the Apostles; but\r\nCastagno must have been thoroughly antipathetic to the Venetians, and\r\nthough he may have taught them the way to draw, he has not left any\r\ntraces of a following.\r\n\r\nFacio, writing in 1455, speaks of Gentile's work in the Ducal Palace as\r\nalready decaying, while Pisanello's was painted out by Alvise Vivarini\r\nand Bellini.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\r\n\r\n _Gentile da Fabriano._\r\n\r\n Florence.

Its glass manufacture\r\nwas safeguarded by the most stringent decrees, which forbade members of\r\nthe Guild to leave the islet under pain of death. Its mosaics, stone\r\nwork, and architecture speak of an early artistic existence, and we\r\nrecognise the justice of the claim of Muranese painters to be the first\r\nto strike out into a more emancipated type than that of the primitives.\r\nThe painter Giovanni of Murano, called Giovanni Alemanus or d' Alemagna,\r\nnames between which Venetian jealousy for a time drew an imaginary\r\ndistinction, had certainly received his early education in Germany, and\r\nbetrays it by his heavier ornamentation and more Gothic style; but he\r\nwas a fellow-worker with Antonio of Murano, the founder of the great\r\nVivarini family, and the Academy contains several large altarpieces in\r\nwhich they collaborated. \"Christ and the Virgin in Glory\" was painted\r\nfor a church in Venice in 1440, and has an inscription with both names\r\non a banderol across the foreground. The Eternal Father, with His hands\r\non the shoulders of the Mother and Son, makes a group of which we find\r\nthe origin in Gentile da Fabriano's altarpiece in the Brera, and it is\r\nprobable that one if not both masters had been studying with the Umbrian\r\nand absorbing the principles he had brought to Venice. It is easy to\r\ntrace the influence of Giovanni d' Alemagna, though not always easy to\r\npick out which part of a picture belongs to him and which to Antonio\r\nworking under his influence. In S. Pantaleone is a \"Coronation of the\r\nVirgin,\" with Gothic ornaments such as are not found in purely Italian\r\nart at this period, but the example in which both masters can be most\r\nclosely followed is the great picture in the Academy, the \"Madonna\r\nenthroned,\" where she sits under a baldaquin surrounded by saints. Here\r\nthe Gothic surroundings become very florid, and have a gingerbread-cake\r\neffect, which Italian taste would hardly have tolerated. Many features\r\nare characteristic of the German; the huge crown worn by the Mother, the\r\nfloriated ornament of the quadrangle, the almost baroque appearance of\r\nthe throne. Through it all, heavily repainted as it is, shines the dawn\r\nof the tender expression which came into Venetian art with Gentile.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Antonio da Murano._\r\n                 ADORATION OF THE MAGI.\r\n                _Berlin._\r\n                 (_Photo, Hanfstängl._)]\r\n\r\nGiovanni d' Alemagna and Antonio da Murano were no doubt widely\r\nemployed, and when the former died Antonio founded and carried on a\r\nreal school in Venice. In 1446 he was living in the parish of S. Maria\r\nFormosa with his wife, who was the daughter of a fruit merchant, and the\r\nwills of both are still preserved in the parish archives. Gentile da\r\nFabriano had set the example for gorgeous processions with gay dresses\r\nand strange animals; winding paths in the background and foreshortened\r\nlimbs prove that attention had been drawn to Paolo Uccello's studies in\r\nperspective, while many figures and horses recall Pisanello. A striking\r\nproof of the sojourn of Gentile and Pisanello in Venice is found in an\r\n\"Adoration of Magi,\" now ascribed to Antonio da Murano, in which the\r\ncentral group, the oldest king kissing the Child's foot, is very like\r\nthat in Gentile's \"Adoration,\" but the foreshortened horses and the\r\nattendants argue the painter's knowledge of Pisanello's work. A\r\ncomparison of the architecture in the background with that in the\r\n\"St. George\" in S. Anastasia shows the same derivation, and the dainty\r\ncavalier, who holds a flag and is in attendance on the youngest king, is\r\nreminiscent of St. George and St. Eustace in Pisanello's paintings in\r\nthe National Gallery, so that in this one picture the influences of the\r\ntwo artists are combined.\r\n\r\nAntonio took his younger brother, Bartolommeo, into partnership, and the\r\ntitle of da Murano was presently dropped for the more modern designation\r\nof Vivarini. Both brothers are fine and delicate in work, but from the\r\noutset of their collaboration the younger man is more advanced and more\r\nfull of the spirit of the innovator. In his altarpiece in the first hall\r\nof the Academy the Nativity has already a new realism; Joseph leans his\r\nhead upon his hand, crushing up his cheek. The saints are particularly\r\nvivid in expression, especially the old hermit holding the bell, whose\r\nface is brimming with ardent feeling.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\r\n\r\n _Giovanni d' Alemanus and Antonio da Murano._\r\n\r\n Venice.

Giotto had been able to present all\r\nthese qualities in the human form, but he had done so by the light of\r\ngenius, and had never formulated any sufficient rules for his followers'\r\nguidance. In Ghiberti's school, at the beginning of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, the fascination of the antique in art was making itself felt,\r\nbut Donatello had escaped from the artificial trammels it threatened to\r\nexercise, and had carried the Florentine school with him in his profound\r\nresearches into the human form itself. Donatello had been working in\r\nPadua for ten years before Pisanello's death, and in an indirect way the\r\nVenetians were experiencing some after-results of the systematising and\r\nformulating of the new pictorial elements. Though the intellectual\r\nlife had met with little encouragement among the positive, practical\r\ninhabitants of Venice, in Padua, which had been subject to her since\r\n1405, speculative thought and ideal studies were in full swing. There\r\nwas no re-birth in Venice, whose tradition was unbroken and where \"men\r\nwere too genuinely pagan to care about the echo of a paganism in the\r\nremote past.\" St. Mark was the deity of Venice, and \"the other twelve\r\nApostles\" were only obscurely connected with her religious life, which\r\nwas strong and orthodox, but untroubled by metaphysical enthusiasms\r\nand inconvenient heresies. Padua, on the other hand, was absorbed in\r\nquestions of learning and religion. A university had been established\r\nhere for two centuries. The abstract study of the antique was carried on\r\nwith fervour, and the memory of Livy threw a lustre over the city which\r\nhad never quite died out. It seemed perfectly right and respectable to\r\nthe Venetians that the _savants_, lying safely removed from the busy\r\nstream of commercial life, should cultivate inquiries into theology\r\nand the classics, which would only have been a hindrance to their own\r\npractical business; but such, as it was well known, were of absorbing\r\ninterest in the circles which gathered round the Medici in Florence. The\r\nschool of art, which was now arising in Padua, was fed from such sources\r\nas these. The love of the antique was becoming a fashion and a guiding\r\nprinciple, and influenced the art of painting more formally than it\r\ncould succeed in doing among the independent and original Florentines.\r\n\r\nFrancesco Squarcione, though, as Vasari says, he may not have been the\r\nbest of painters, has left work (now at Berlin) which is accepted as\r\ngenuine and which shows that he was more than the mere organiser he is\r\nsometimes called. He had travelled in Greece, and was apparently a\r\ndealer, supplying the demand for classic fragments, which was becoming\r\nwidespread. When he founded his school in Padua he evidently was its\r\nleading spirit and a powerful artistic influence. His pupils, even the\r\ngreatest, were long in breaking away from his convention, and few of\r\nthem threw it off entirely, even in after life. That convention was\r\ncarried with undeviating thoroughness into every detail. Draperies are\r\narranged in statuesque folds, designed to display every turn of the form\r\nbeneath; the figures are moulded with all the precision and limitations\r\nof statuary. The very landscape becomes sculpturesque, and rocks of a\r\nvolcanic character are constructed with the regularity of masonry. The\r\ncolour and technique are equally uncompromising, and the surface becomes\r\na beautiful enamel, unyielding, definite in its lines, lacquer-like in\r\nits firmness of finish, while the Gothic forms, which had hitherto been\r\nso prevalent, were replaced by more or less pedantic adaptations from\r\nRoman bas-reliefs. This system of design was practised most determinedly\r\nin Padua itself, but it soon spread to Venice. Squarcione himself was\r\nemployed there after 1440, and though Antonio da Murano clung to the old\r\narchaic style he saw the Paduan manner invading his kingdom, and his own\r\nbrother became strongly Squarcionesque.\r\n\r\nThe two brothers of Murano come most closely together in an altarpiece\r\nin the gallery of Bologna, where the framework is more simple than\r\nAlemanus's German taste would have permitted, and the Madonna and Child\r\nhave some natural ease, and the delicacy of feeling of primitive art.\r\nBartolommeo, when he breaks away and sets out to paint by himself, is\r\ncrude and strong, but full of vital force. In his altarpiece of 1464,\r\nin the Academy, he gives his saints reality by taking them off their\r\npedestals and making them stand upon the ground, and though they are\r\nstill isolated from one another in the partitions of an ancona, their\r\nsparkling eyes, individual features, and curly beards give them a look\r\nof life. The draperies, thin and clinging, with little rucked folds,\r\nwhich display the forms, and the drawing of the bony structure,\r\nexaggerated in the arms and legs, are Squarcionesque. The rocks and\r\nstones, too, show the Paduan convention. In several of his other\r\naltarpieces, Bartolommeo introduces rich ornaments and swags of fruit,\r\nsuch as Donatello had first brought to Padua, or which Paduan artists\r\ndelighted to copy from classic columns. Antonio's manner to the end is\r\nthe local Venetian manner, infused as it was with the soft and charming\r\ninfluence of Gentile da Fabriano and Pisanello, but Bartolommeo adopts\r\nthe new and more ambitious style. Though not a very good painter, and\r\ninclined to be puffy and shapeless in his flesh forms, he was the head\r\nof a crowd of artists, and works of his school, signed _Opus factum_,\r\nwent all over Italy, and are found as far south as Bari. Works of his\r\npupils are numerous; the \"St. Mark enthroned\" in the Frari is as good if\r\nnot better than the master's own work, and the triptych in the Correr\r\nMuseum is a free imitation.\r\n\r\nRound this early school gathered such painters as Antonio da Negroponte\r\nand Quirizio da Murano, who were both working in 1450. Negroponte has\r\nleft an enthroned Madonna in S. Francesco della Vigna, which is one of\r\nthe most beautiful examples of colour and of the fanciful charm of the\r\nRenaissance that the early art of Venice has to show. The Mother and\r\nChild are placed in a marble shrine, adorned with antique reliefs, rich\r\nwreaths of fruit swag above her head, a little Gothic loggia is full of\r\nflowers and fruit, and birds are perched on cornucopias. On either\r\nside, four badly drawn little angels, with ugly faces and awkwardly\r\nforeshortened forms, foreshadow the beautiful, music-making angels which\r\nbecame such a feature of North Italian art. The Divine Mother, adoring\r\nthe Child lying across her knees, has an exquisite, pensive face,\r\nconceived with all the delicacy and simplicity of early art. It seems\r\nquite possible, as Professor Leonello Venturi suggests, that we have\r\nhere the early master of Crivelli, in whom we find the love of fruit\r\ngarlands, of chains of beads and rich brocades carried to its farthest\r\nlimits, who takes keen pleasure in introducing the ugly but lively\r\nlittle angels, and who gives the same pensive and almost mincing\r\nexpression to his Madonnas.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\r\n\r\n _Antonio da Murano and Bartolommeo Vivarini._\r\n\r\n Bologna.

Both Gentile and\r\nhis apprentice were subjected to annoyance from the time they arrived in\r\nFlorence, where the strict regulations which governed the Guilds made it\r\nvery difficult for any newcomer to practise his art. The records of a\r\npolice case report that on the 11th of June 1423 some young men, among\r\nthem, one, Bernabo di San Silvestri, the son of a notary, were observed\r\nthrowing stones into the painter's room. His assistant, Jacopo Bellini,\r\ncame out and drove the assailants away with blows, but Bernabo, accusing\r\nJacopo of assault, the latter was committed to prison in default of\r\npayment. After six months' imprisonment, a compromise of the fine and a\r\npenitential declaration set him at liberty. The accounts declare that\r\nGentile took no steps to be of service to his follower; but Jacopo soon\r\nafter married a girl from Pesaro, and his first son was christened after\r\nhis old master, which does not look as though they were on unfriendly\r\nterms. Jacopo travelled in the Romagna, and was much esteemed by the\r\nEstes of Ferrara, but he was back in Venice in 1430. He has left us only\r\nthree signed works, and one or two more have lately been attributed to\r\nhim, but they give very little idea of what an important master he was.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Jacopo Bellini._\r\n                 AGONY IN GARDEN--DRAWING.\r\n                _British Museum._\r\n                 (_Photo, Anderson._)]\r\n\r\nHis Madonna in the Academy has a round, simple type of face, and in the\r\nLouvre Madonna, which is attributed but not signed, it is easy to\r\nrecognise the same arched eyebrows and half-shut, curved eyelids. In\r\nthis picture, where the Madonna blesses the kneeling Leonello d' Este,\r\nwe see how Pisanello acted on Jacopo and, through him, on Venetian art.\r\nThe connection between the two masters has been established in a very\r\ninteresting way by Professor Antonio Venturi's discovery of a sonnet,\r\nwritten in 1441, which recounts how they painted rival portraits of\r\nLeonello, and how Bellini made so lively a likeness that he was\r\nadjudged the first place. The landscape in the Louvre picture is\r\nadvanced in treatment, and with its gilded mountain-tops, its stag and\r\nits town upon the hill-side, is full of reminiscences of Pisanello,\r\nespecially of the \"St. George\" in S. Anastasia. We come upon such\r\ntraces, too, in Jacopo's drawings, and it is by his two sketch-books\r\nthat we can best judge of his greatness. One of these is in the British\r\nMuseum; the other, in the Louvre, was discovered not many years ago in\r\nthe granary of a castle in Guyenne. These drawings reveal Jacopo as one\r\nof the greatest masters of his day. He is larger, simpler, and more\r\nnatural than Pisanello, and he apparently cares less for the human\r\nfigure than for elaborate backgrounds and surroundings. Many of his\r\ndesigns we shall refer to again when we come to speak of his two sons.\r\nHis \"Supper of Herod\" reminds us of Masolino's fresco at Castiglione\r\nd' Olona. He sketches designs for numbers of religious scenes, treated\r\nin an original and interesting manner. A \"Crucifixion\" has bands of\r\nsoldiers ranged on either side, an \"Adoration of the Magi\" has a string\r\nof camels coming down the hill, the executioners in a \"Scourging\" wear\r\nEastern head-dresses. In a sketch for a \"Baptism of Christ\" tall angels\r\nhold the garments in the early traditional way; on one side two play\r\nthe lute and the violin, while the two on the other side have a trumpet\r\nand an organ. He has sketches for the Ascension, Resurrection,\r\nCircumcision, and Entombment, repeated over and over again with\r\nvariations, and one of S. Bernardino preaching in Venice (where he was\r\nin 1427). Jacopo delights even more in fanciful and mythological than in\r\nsacred subjects. A tournament with spectators, a Faun riding a lion, a\r\n\"Triumph of Bacchus\" with panthers, are among such essays. The fauns\r\npipe, the wine-god bears a vase of fruit. His love of animals is equal\r\nto that of Pisanello, and S. Hubert and the stag with the crucifix\r\nbetween its horns is directly reminiscent of the Veronese. His horses,\r\nof which there are immense numbers, sometimes look as if copied from\r\nancient bas-reliefs. His treatment of single nude figures is often\r\npoor and weak enough, and his rocks have the flat-topped, geological\r\nformation of the Paduan School, but no one who so drank in every\r\ndescription of lively scene about him could have been in any danger of\r\nbecoming a mere archeological type, and it was from this pitfall that he\r\nrescued Mantegna. To judge by his drawings, Jacopo did not overlook any\r\nsource of art open to him; he delights in the rich research of the\r\nPaduans as much as in the varieties of wild nature and all the incidents\r\nof contemporary life first annexed by Pisanello. He is often very like\r\nGentile da Fabriano, he makes raids into Uccello's domains of\r\nperspective, he is frankly mundane and draws a revel of satyrs and\r\ncentaurs with a real interpretation of the lyrical and pagan spirit of\r\nthe Greeks, and he has an idealism of the soul, which found its full\r\nexpression in his son, Giovanni. We cannot call Jacopo Bellini the\r\nfounder of the Venetian School, for its makings existed already, but it\r\nwas his influence on his sons which, above all, was accountable for the\r\ndevelopment of early excellence. His long, flowing lines have a sweep\r\nand a fanciful grace which form an absolute antidote to the definite,\r\ngeometrical Paduan convention. In Jacopo we see the thorough\r\nassimilation of those foreign elements which were in sympathy with\r\nthe Venetian atmosphere, and while up to now Venice had only imbibed\r\ninfluences, she was soon to create for herself an artistic _milieu_ and\r\nto become the leader of the movement of painting in the north of Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\r\n\r\n _Jacopo Bellini._\r\n\r\n Brescia.

Crivelli shows intellect, individuality, even genius, in the\r\nway in which he grapples with his medium and produces his own reading,\r\nand the circumstances of his life were such as to throw him in upon\r\nhimself and to preserve his originality. His little early \"Madonna and\r\nChild\" at Verona is linked with that of Negroponte by the elaborate\r\nfestoons, strings of beads, and large-patterned brocades used in the\r\nsurroundings, and has those ugly, foreshortened little _putti_, holding\r\nthe instruments of the Passion, of the type elaborated by Squarcione and\r\nMarco Zoppo, and which, in their improved state, we are accustomed to\r\nthink of as Mantegnesque.\r\n\r\nWhen Crivelli was thirty-eight years old, he was condemned to six\r\nmonths' imprisonment and to a fine of two hundred lire for an outrage\r\non a neighbour's wife. Perhaps it was to escape from an unenviable\r\nreputation that he left Venice soon after and set up painting in the\r\nMarches, where he lived from 1468 to 1473. He then went on to Camerino\r\nin Umbria, where his great triptych, now in the Brera, was painted,\r\nand a few years later he was in Ascoli, with a commission for an\r\nAnnunciation in the Cathedral. This is the picture now in the National\r\nGallery, in which the Bishop holds a model of the Duomo. After 1490 he\r\nworked in little towns in the Marches, and is not mentioned after 1493.\r\nHe does not seem ever to have come back to Venice.\r\n\r\nShut up in the Marches, where there was little strong local talent, and\r\nwhere he could not keep up with the progress that was taking place in\r\nVenice, he was obliged himself to supply the artistic movement. He kept\r\nthe Squarcionesque traditions to the end, but moulded them by his own\r\nlove of rich and exuberant decoration. Moreover, he was of a very\r\nintense religious bias, and this finds a deeply touching and mystical\r\nexpression, more especially in his Pietàs. The love of gilded patterns\r\nand fanciful detail was deep-seated in all the Umbrian country. His\r\naltarpieces were intended as sumptuous additions to rich churches, and\r\nwere consequently arranged, with many divisions, in the old Muranese\r\nmanner. His great ancona, in the National Gallery, is a marvel of\r\nelaborate ornament and enamel-like painting. The Madonna is delicate,\r\nalmost affected in her refinement. Her long fingers hold the Child's\r\ngarment with the extreme of dainty precision, the croziers and rings of\r\nthe saints and bishops are embossed with gold and real jewels. The\r\nflowers in the panel of \"The Immaculate Conception,\" which hangs beside\r\nit, are twisted into heads of mythological beasts and grotesques or\r\ncherubs; but Crivelli has plenty of strength, and his male saints have\r\nvigorous, bony limbs and fierce fanatical eyes. It is, however, in his\r\ncolour that he charms us most, and though he does not touch the real\r\nfount, he is of all the earlier school the most remarkable for subtle\r\ntender tones and lovely harmonies of olive-greens and faded rose and\r\ncream embossed with gold.\r\n\r\nCrivelli continued executing one great ancona after another, limiting\r\nhis progress to perfecting his technique, and his influence was most\r\ndeeply felt by such Umbrian painters as Lorenzo di San Severino and\r\nNiccola Alunno. The honours paid him testify to the reputation he\r\nacquired. He was created a knight and presented with a golden laurel\r\nwreath. But though he never, that we can hear of, revisited his native\r\nState, he always adds _Venetus_ to the signature on his paintings, a\r\nfact which tells us that far from Venice and in provincial districts,\r\nher prestige was felt and gave his work an enhanced commercial value.\r\nHe had no after-influence upon the Venetian School, and in this respect\r\nis interesting as an example of the tenacity exercised by the\r\nSquarcionesque methods, when, unchecked by any counter-attraction, they\r\ncame to act upon a very different temperament; for in his love of grace\r\nand beauty and of rich effects, and especially in his intensity of\r\nmystic feeling, Crivelli is a true Venetian and has no natural affinity\r\nwith the classic spirit of the Paduans.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\r\n\r\n Venice.

The Florentines, Fra Angelico, Andrea del\r\nCastagno, and Pesellino were lately dead. Antonio Pollaiuolo was in his\r\nprime, Fra Lippo was fifty-four, Paolo Uccello was sixty-three. But\r\nthough the progress in the north had been slower, art both in Padua and\r\nVenice was now in vigorous progress. Bartolommeo Vivarini was still\r\npainting and gathering round him a numerous band of followers; Mantegna\r\nwas thirty, had just completed the frescoes in the Eremitani Chapel and\r\nthe famous altarpiece in S. Zeno; and Gentile and Giovanni Bellini were\r\ntwo and four years his seniors.\r\n\r\nFrancesco Negro, writing in the early years of the sixteenth century,\r\nspeaks of Gentile as the elder son of Jacopo Bellini. Giovanni is\r\nthought to have been an illegitimate son, as Jacopo's widow only\r\nmentions Gentile and another son, Niccolo, in her will. There is every\r\nreason to believe that, as was natural, the two brothers were the pupils\r\nand assistants of their father. A \"Madonna\" in the Mond Collection, the\r\nearliest known of Gentile's works, shows him imitating his father's\r\nstyle; but when his sister, Niccolosia, married Mantegna in 1453, it is\r\nnot surprising to find him following Mantegna's methods for a time, and\r\na fresco of St. Mark in the Scuola di San Marco, an important commission\r\nwhich he received in 1466, is taken direct from Mantegna's fresco at\r\nPadua.\r\n\r\nAs the Bellini matured, they abandoned the Squarcionesque tradition and\r\nevolved a style of their own; Gentile as much as his even more famous\r\nbrother. Gentile is the first chronicler of the men and manners of his\r\ntime. In 1460 he settled in Venice, and was appointed to paint the organ\r\ndoors in St. Mark's. These large saints, especially the St. Mark, still\r\nrecall the Paduan period. They have festoons of grapes and apples hung\r\nfrom the architectural ornaments, and the cast of drapery, showing the\r\nform beneath, reminds us of Mantegna's figures. But Gentile soon becomes\r\nan illustrator and portrait painter. Much of his work was done in the\r\nScuola of St. Mark, where his father had painted, and this was destroyed\r\nby fire in 1485. Early, too, is the fine austere portrait of Lorenzo\r\nGiustiniani, in the Academy. In 1479 an emissary from the Sultan\r\nMehemet arrived in Venice and requested the Signoria to recommend a good\r\npainter and a man clever at portraits. Gentile was chosen, and departed\r\nin September for Constantinople. He painted many subjects for the\r\nprivate apartments of the Sultan, as well as the famous portrait now in\r\nthe possession of Lady Layard. It would be difficult for a historic\r\nportrait to show more insight into character. The face is cold, weary,\r\nand sensual, with all the over-refined look of an old race and a long\r\ncivilisation, and has a melancholy note in its distant and satiated\r\ngaze. The Sultan showed Gentile every mark of favour, loaded him with\r\npresents, and bestowed on him the title of Bey. He returned home in\r\n1493, bringing with him many sketches of Eastern personages and the\r\npicture, now in the Louvre, representing the reception of a Venetian\r\nEmbassy by the Grand Vizier. Some five years before Gentile's commission\r\nto Constantinople Antonello da Messina had arrived in Venice, and the\r\nspread and popularisation of oil-painting had hastened the casting off\r\nof outworn ecclesiastical methods and brought the painters nearer to the\r\ntruth of life. Antonello did not actually introduce oils to the notice\r\nof Venetian painters, for Bartolommeo Vivarini was already using them in\r\n1473, but he was well known by reputation before he arrived, and having\r\nprobably come into contact with Flemish painters in Naples, he had had\r\nbetter opportunities of seizing upon the new technique, and was able to\r\nestablish it both in Milan and in Venice. A large number of Venetians\r\nwere at this time resident in Messina: the families of Lombardo,\r\nGradenigo, Contarini, Bembo, Morosini, and Foscarini were among those\r\nwho had members settled there. Many of these were patrons of art, and\r\nprobably paved the way to Antonello's reception in Venice. At first all\r\nthe traits of Antonello's early work are Flemish: the full mantles,\r\nwhite linen caps and tuckers, the straight sharp folds and long wings of\r\nthe angels have much of Van Eyck, but when he gets to Venice in 1475,\r\nits colour and life fascinate him, and a great change comes over his\r\nwork. His portraits show that he grasped a new intensity of life,\r\nand let us into the character of the men he saw around him. His\r\n\"Condottiere,\" in the Louvre, declares the artist's recognition of\r\nthat truculent and formidable being, full of aristocratic disdain, the\r\nproduct of a daring, unscrupulous life. The \"Portrait of a Humanist,\"\r\nin the Castello in Milan, is classic in its deepest sense; and in the\r\nTrivulzio College at Milan an older man looks at us out of sly,\r\nexpressive eyes, with characteristic eyebrows and kindly, half-cynical\r\nmouth. It was not wonderful that these portraits, combined with the new\r\nmedium, worked upon Gentile's imagination and determined his bent.\r\n\r\nThe first examples of great canvases, illustrating and celebrating\r\ntheir own pageants, must have mightily pleased the Venetians. Scenes\r\nin the style of the reception of the Venetian ambassadors were called\r\nfor on all hands, and when the excellence of Gentile's portraits was\r\nrecognised, he became the model for all Venice. When his own and his\r\nfather's and brother's paintings perished by fire in 1485, he offered\r\nto replace them \"quicker than was humanly possible\" and at a very low\r\nprice. Giovanni, who had been engaged on the external decorations, was\r\nill at the time, but the Signoria was so pleased with the offer that it\r\nwas decided to let no one touch the work till the two brothers were\r\nable to finish it. Gentile still painted religious altarpieces with the\r\nVirgin and Child enthroned with saints, but most of his time was devoted\r\nto the production of his great canvases. Some of these have disappeared,\r\nbut the \"Procession\" and \"Miracle of the Cross,\" commissioned by the\r\nschool of S. Giovanni Evangelista, are now in the Academy, and the\r\nthird canvas, executed for the same school, \"St. Mark preaching at\r\nAlexandria,\" which was unfinished at the time of his death, and was\r\ncompleted by his brother, is in the Brera.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Gentile Bellini._\r\n                 PROCESSION OF THE HOLY CROSS.\r\n                _Venice._\r\n                 (_Photo, Anderson._)]\r\n\r\nThese great compositions of crowds bring back for us the Venice of\r\nGentile's day as no verbal description can do. There is no especial\r\nrichness of colour; the light is that of broad day in the Piazza and\r\namong the luminous waterways of the city. We can see the scene any\r\nday now in the wide square, making allowance for the difference of\r\ncostume. The groups are set about in the ample space, with the wonderful\r\ncathedral as a background. St. Mark's has been painted hundreds of\r\ntimes, but no one has ever given such a good idea of it as Gentile--of\r\nits stateliness and beauty, of its wealth of detail; and he does so\r\nwithout detracting from the general effect, for St. Mark's, though the\r\nkeynote of the whole composition, is kept subservient, and is part of\r\nthe stage on which the scene is enacted. The procession passes along,\r\ncarrying the relics, attended by the waxlights and the banners. Behind\r\nthe reliquary kneels the merchant, Jacopo Salò, petitioning for the\r\nrecovery of his wounded son. Then come the musicians; the spectators\r\ncrowd round, they strain forward to see the chief part of the cortège,\r\nas a crowd naturally does. Some watch with reverence, others smile or\r\nhave a negligent air. The faces of the candle-bearers are very like\r\nthose we may see to-day in a great Church procession: some absorbed in\r\ntheir task, or uplifted by inner thoughts; others looking curiously\r\nand sceptically at the crowd. Gentile tries in his crowds to bring\r\ntogether all the types of life in Venice, all the officials and the\r\necclesiastical world, the young and old. With a few strokes he creates\r\nthe individual and also the type;--the careless rover; the responsible\r\nmagistrate; the shrewd, practical man of business; the young men, full\r\nof their own plans, but pausing to look on at one of the great religious\r\nsights of their city. In the \"Finding of the Cross\" he produces the\r\neffect of the whole city _en fête_. It was a sight which often met his\r\neyes. The Doge made no fewer than thirty-six processions annually to\r\nvarious churches of the city, and on fourteen of these occasions he was\r\naccompanied by the whole of the nobles dressed in their State robes.\r\nEvery event of importance was seized on by the Venetian ladies as an\r\nopportunity for arraying themselves in the richest attire, cloth of gold\r\nand velvet, plumes and jewels. Gentile has massed the ladies of Queen\r\nCatherine Cornaro's Court around their Queen upon the left side of the\r\ncanal. The light from above streams upon the keeper of the School, who\r\nholds the sacred relic on high. All round are the old, irregular\r\nVenetian houses, and in the crowd he paints the variety of men he saw\r\naround him every day in Venice. Yet even in this animated scene he\r\nretains his old quattrocento calm. The groups are decorously assisting:\r\nonly here and there he is drawn off to some small detail of reality,\r\nsuch as an oarsman dexterously turning his boat, or the maid letting the\r\nnegro servant pass out to take a header into the canal. The spectators\r\nlook on coolly at one more of the oft-seen, miraculous events. The\r\ncommittee, kneeling at the side, is a row of unforgettable portraits,\r\ngrave, benign, sour, and austere, with bald head or flowing hair. In\r\nthis composition he triumphs over all difficulties of perspective; our\r\neye follows the canals, and the boats pass away under the bridge in\r\natmospheric light. All the joy of Venice is in that play of light on\r\nbroad brick surfaces, light which is cast up from the water and dances\r\nand shimmers on the marble façades.\r\n\r\nGentile made his will in 1502, as well as others in 1505 and 1506. He\r\nleft word that he was to be buried in SS. Giovanni e Paolo, and begged\r\nhis brother Giovanni to finish the work in the Scuola, in return for\r\nwhich he is to receive their father's sketch-book. The unfinished piece\r\nis the \"St. Mark preaching at Alexandria,\" and it shows Gentile still\r\ndeveloping his capacity as a painter. It is pale in colour but brilliant\r\nin sunlight. The mass of white given by the head-dresses of the Turkish\r\nwomen is cleverly subdued so as not to detract from the effect of the\r\nsunlight. The thronged effect of the great square is studied with more\r\nthan his usual care, and the faces have all the old individuality. The\r\nforemost figures in the crowd have a colour and richness which we may\r\nattribute to Giovanni's hand.\r\n\r\nGentile was always fully employed, and the detailed paintings of\r\nfunctions became very popular; but he was a far less modern painter\r\nthan his brother, and, in fact, they represent two distinct artistic\r\ngenerations, though Gentile's work was so much the most elaborate and,\r\nas the quattrocento would have thought, the most ambitious.\r\n\r\nGentile is essentially the historic painter, yet his is a grave, sincere\r\nart, and he has an unerring instinct for the right incidents to include.\r\nHe cuts out all unseemly trivialities, his actors are stern, powerful\r\nmen, the treatment is historic and contemporary, but not gossipy. We\r\nrealise the look of the Venice of his day, in all its tide of human\r\nnature, but we also feel that he never forgot that he was chronicling\r\nthe doings of a city of strong men, and that he must paint them, even in\r\ntheir hours of relaxation and emotion, so as to convey the real dignity\r\nand power which underlay all the events of the Republic.\r\n\r\nWe gather from his will and that of his wife that they had no children,\r\nwhich perhaps makes the more natural the affectionate terms upon which\r\nhe remained all through his life with his brother. Their artistic\r\nsympathies must have differed widely. Gentile's love for historical\r\nresearch, for costume and for pageants, found no echo in the deeper\r\nidealism of Giovanni--indeed, his offer of the famous sketch-book, as an\r\ninducement to the latter to finish his last great work, seems to hint\r\nthat it was an exercise out of his brother's line; but he knew that\r\nGiovanni was a great painter, and did not trust it, as we might have\r\nexpected, to his assistants, Giovanni Mansueti and Girolamo da\r\nSantacroce.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\r\n\r\n _Gentile Bellini._\r\n\r\n London.

The latter being an enthusiastic follower of\r\nSquarcione, Alvise was at first trained in Paduan principles. Jacopo\r\nBellini's efforts had done something to counteract the hard, statuesque\r\nPaduan manner, and had rendered Mantegna's art more human and less\r\nstony, but Jacopo could not prevent Squarcionesque painters from\r\nimporting into Venice the style which he disliked so much. Bartolommeo\r\nthrew in his lot with the Paduans, and his school, especially when\r\nreinforced by Alvise, maintained its reputation as long as it only\r\nhad to compete with local talent. The Vivarinis had now been firmly\r\nestablished in Venice for two generations, and were the best-known and\r\nmost popular of her painters. Albert Dürer, on his first visit, admired\r\nthem more than the Bellini. When, however, Gentile and his brother set\r\nup in Venice, a hot rivalry arose between them and the old Muranese\r\nSchool. The Bellini had come with their father from Padua, with all its\r\nnew and scientific fashions. They had all the prestige of relationship\r\nwith Mantegna, and they shared the patronage of his powerful employers.\r\nThe striking historical compositions of Gentile were at once in demand\r\nby the great confraternities. Bartolommeo had never been very successful\r\nin his dealing with oil-painting, though he had dabbled in it for some\r\nyears before Antonello da Messina came his way, but the perception with\r\nwhich the Bellini at once grasped the new technique gave them the\r\nvictory. We have only to compare the formless contours of much of\r\nBartolommeo Vivarini's work, the bladder-like flesh-painting of the\r\nHoly Child, with the clear luminous colour and firm delicate touch of\r\nGentile, to see that the one man is leagues ahead of the other.\r\n\r\nAlvise Vivarini had more natural affinity with his father than with his\r\nuncle. He never becomes so exaggerated in his forms as Bartolommeo. The\r\nexpression of his faces is much deeper and more inward, and he has\r\nsomething of the devotional sweetness of early art. His first known\r\nwork is an ancona of 1475 at Montefiorentino, in a lonely Franciscan\r\nmonastery on the spurs of the Apennines. In the centre of the five\r\npanels the Madonna sits with her hands pressed palm to palm, in\r\nadoration of the Child asleep across her knees. The painter here follows\r\nthe tradition of his father and uncle, especially in the Bologna\r\naltarpiece, in which they collaborated in 1450. Four saints stand on\r\neither side, framed in Gothic panels; it is all in the old way, and\r\nit is only by degrees that we see there is more sweetness in the\r\nexpression, better modelling in the figures, and a slenderer, more\r\ngraceful outline than the earlier anconæ can show. Only five years after\r\nthis ancona at Montefiorentino, with its stiff rows of isolated saints,\r\nwe have the altarpiece in the Academy \"of 1480,\" which was painted for a\r\nchurch in Treviso, and here a great change is immediately apparent. The\r\nantiquated division into panels has disappeared, nothing is left of the\r\nartificial, Squarcionesque decorations, the attitudes are simple, and\r\nthe scene is a united one. The Madonna's outstretched hand, the\r\nsuggestion of \"Ecce Agnus Dei,\" makes an appeal which draws the\r\nattention of all the saints to one point, and it is made plain that the\r\none idea pervades the entire assembly. The curtain, which symbolises the\r\nsanctuary, still hangs behind the throne, but the gold background is\r\nabandoned. Alvise has not indeed, as yet, imagined any landscape or\r\nconstructed an interior, but he lightens the effect by two arched\r\nwindows which let in the sky. The forms are characteristic of his\r\nidea of drawing the human figure; they have the long thighs with the\r\nknees low down, which we are accustomed to find, and he constructs a\r\nvery fine and sharply contrasted scheme of light and shade. There is no\r\ntrace of the statuesque Paduan draperies. The Virgin's brocaded mantle\r\nis simply draped, and the robes of the saints hang in long straight\r\nfolds. No doubt Alvise, though nominally the rival of the Bellini, has\r\nmore affinity with them, particularly with Giovanni, than with the\r\nPaduan artists, and as time goes on it is evident that he paints with\r\nmany glances at what they were doing. In the altarpiece in Berlin he\r\nconstructs an elaborate cupola above the Virgin, such as Bellini was\r\nalready using. His saints are full of movement. In the end he begins to\r\nattitudinise and to display those artificial graces which were presently\r\naccentuated by Lotto.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Alvise Vivarini._\r\n                 ALTARPIECE OF 1480.\r\n                _Venice._\r\n                 (_Photo, Anderson._)]\r\n\r\nIn 1488 the two Bellini had for some time been employed in the Sala del\r\nGran Consiglio by the Council of Ten. Alvise, with his busy school, had\r\nhoped, but hitherto in vain, to be invited to enter into competition\r\nwith them. At length he wrote the following letter:--\r\n\r\n     TO THE MOST SERENE THE PRINCE AND THE MOST EXCELLENT\r\n     SIGNORIA--I am Alvise of Murano, a faithful servant of your\r\n     Serenity and of this most illustrious State. I have long been\r\n     anxious to exercise my skill before your Sublimity and prove\r\n     that continued study and labour on my part have not been\r\n     useless. Therefore offer, as a humble subject, in honour and\r\n     praise of that celebrated city, to devote myself, without\r\n     return of payment or reward, to the duty of producing a canvas\r\n     in the Sala del Gran Consiio, according to the method at\r\n     present in use by the two brothers Bellinii, and I ask no more\r\n     for the said canvas than that I should be allowed the expenses\r\n     of the cloth and colours as well as the wages of the\r\n     journeymen, in the manner that has been granted to the said\r\n     Bellinii. When I have done I shall leave to your Serenity of\r\n     his goodness to give me in his wisdom the price which shall be\r\n     adjudged to be just, honest, and appropriate, in return for the\r\n     labour, which I shall be enabled, I trust, to continue to the\r\n     universal satisfaction of your Serenity and of all the\r\n     excellent Government, to the grace of which I most heartily\r\n     commend myself.\r\n\r\nThe \"method at present in use\" was presumably the oil-painting\r\nestablished by Antonello, which was now being made use of to replace\r\nthe decorations in fresco and tempera which Guariento, Pisanello, and\r\nGentile da Fabriano had executed, and which were constantly decaying and\r\nsuffering from the sea air and the dampness of the climate. The Council\r\naccepted Alvise's offer with little delay, and he was told to paint a\r\npicture for a space hitherto occupied by one of Pisanello's, and was\r\ngiven a salary of sixty ducats a year, something less than that drawn by\r\nGiovanni Bellini. Unfortunately his work, scenes from the history of\r\nBarbarossa, perished in the great fire of 1577.\r\n\r\nVenice is rich in works which show us what sort of painter was at the\r\nhead of the Muranese School at the time when it rivalled that of the\r\nBellini. Alvise has two reading saints on either side of the altarpiece\r\nof 1480, and of these the Baptist is one of his best figures, \"admirably\r\nexpressive of tension and of brooding thought.\" It is large and free in\r\nstroke, and particularly advanced in the treatment of the foliage. Close\r\nby hangs a character-study of St. Clare; type of a strenuous, fanatical\r\nold woman, one which belongs not only to the period, but will be\r\nrecognised by every student of human nature. Formidable and even cruel\r\nis her unflinching gaze; she is such a figure as might have stood for\r\nScott's Prioress, and looks as little likely to show mercy to an erring\r\nmember of her order. In contrast, there is the exquisite little \"Madonna\r\nand Child\" with the two baby angels, still shown as a Bellini in the\r\nsacristy of the Church of the Redentore. It is the most absolutely\r\nsimple and direct picture of the kind painted in Venice. The baby life\r\nis more perfect than anything that Gian. Bellini produced, and if much\r\nless intellectual than his Madonnas, there is all the tender charm of\r\nthe primitives, combined with a freedom of drapery and a softness of\r\nform which could not be surpassed. The two little angels are more\r\nmundane in spirit than those of the school of Bellini; they have nothing\r\nof the mystical quality, though we are reminded of Bellini, and the\r\npainting is an exercise in his manner. In the sacristy of San Giobbe is\r\nan early Annunciation, which is now definitely assigned to Alvise. It\r\nhas the old tender sentiment, and the carnations of its draperies are of\r\na lovely tint. The priests of S. Giovanni in Bragora were great patrons\r\nof the school of the Vivarini, for here, besides several works by\r\nBartolommeo and his assistants, is a little Madonna in a side chapel,\r\nwhich may be compared with the Redentore picture. The Mother sits inside\r\na room, with the Child lying across her knees in the same pose. The two\r\narched openings in the background of the 1480 altarpiece have become\r\nwindows, through which we look out on a charming landscape of lake and\r\nmountain. In the same church a \"Resurrection\" is not to be overlooked.\r\nIt was executed in 1498, and some of the grace and beauty of the\r\nsixteenth century has crept into it. Against the pink flush of dawn\r\nstands the swaying figure of the risen Christ, and below appear the\r\nheads of the two guards, looking up, surprised and joyful. It is perhaps\r\nthe very earliest example of that soft and sensuous feeling, that\r\nrhapsody of sensation which was presently to sweep like a flood over the\r\nart of Venice. \"What a time must the dawn of the sixteenth century have\r\nbeen when a man of seventy, and not the most vigorous and advanced of\r\nhis age, had the freshness and youthful courage to greet it; nay,\r\nactually to depict its magic and glamour as Alvise does in the\r\n'Resurrection'! Giorgione is here anticipated in the roundness and\r\nsoftness of the figures, and in the effect of light. Titian's Assunta is\r\nforeshadowed in the fervour of the guards' expressions.\" Alvise, if he\r\nnever thoroughly mastered the structure of the nude, and if his forms\r\nkeep throughout some touch of the archaic, some awkwardness in the\r\nthickness of the figures, with their round heads, long thighs, and\r\nuncertain proportions, is yet extraordinarily refined and tender in\r\nsentiment, his line has a natural flow and beauty, and the heads of his\r\nMadonnas and saints cannot be surpassed in loveliness.\r\n\r\nHis death came when the noble altarpiece to St. Ambrogio in the Frari\r\nwas still unfinished, and it was completed by his assistant, Marco\r\nBasaiti. The execution is heavy and probably of Basaiti, but the\r\nvenerable doctor is a grand figure, and the two young soldier saints on\r\nhis right and left hand are striking examples of the beauty we claim\r\nfor him. The architectural plan is very elaborate, but altogether\r\nsuccessful. The group is set beneath an arched vault supported by\r\ncolumns and cornices. Overhead, behind a balustrade, is placed a\r\ncoronation of the Virgin. The many figures are grouped so as not to\r\ninterfere with each other, and the sword of St. George, the crozier of\r\nSt. Gregory, and the crook of St. Ambrose break up the composition and\r\ngive length and line. The faces of the saints are extremely beautiful,\r\nand the two angels making music below compare well with those of the\r\nBellinesque School.\r\n\r\nThe portraits Alvise has left add to his reputation, and remind us of\r\nthose of Antonello da Messina, particularly in the vital expression\r\nof the eyes, though they are without Antonello's intense force. The\r\n\"Bernardo di Salla\" and the \"Man feeding a Hawk,\" though some critics\r\nstill ascribe them to Savoldo, have features which make their\r\nattribution to Alvise almost certainly correct. Indeed, the resemblance\r\nof Bernardo to the Madonna in the 1480 altarpiece cannot escape the most\r\nunscientific observer. There is the same inflated nostril, the\r\npeculiarly curved mouth, and vivacious eyes.\r\n\r\nAmong the followers of Alvise, Marco Basaiti, Bartolommeo Montagna, and\r\nLorenzo Lotto are the most distinguished. Others less direct are\r\nGiovanni Buonconsiglio and Francesco Bonsignori, while Cima da\r\nConegliano was for a short time his greatest pupil. We shall return to\r\nthese later.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\r\n\r\n Berlin.  Madonna enthroned, with six Saints.\r\n London.  Portrait of Youth.\r\n Milan.

He and his\r\nmaster stand apart in having, before the arrival of the Venetian School\r\nproper, captured an aspect and a charm inspired by the natural beauty\r\nof the City of the Sea. Gentile, as we have seen, paints her historic\r\nappearance, and Carpaccio gives us something of the delight we feel\r\nto-day in her translucent waters and her ample, sea-washed spaces\r\nflooded with limpid light. While others were absorbed in assimilating\r\nextraneous influences, he goes on his own way, painting, indeed, the\r\nscenes that were asked for, but painting them in his own manner and with\r\nhis own enjoyment.\r\n\r\nPageant-pictures had been the demand of the Venetian State from very\r\nearly days. The first use of painting had been that made by the Church\r\nto glorify religion, and very soon the State had followed, using it to\r\nenhance the love which Venetians bore to their city, and to bring home\r\nto them the consciousness of its greatness and glory. Pageants and\r\nprocessions were an integral part of Venetian life. The people looked\r\non at them, often as they occurred, with more pride and sense of\r\nproprietorship than a Londoner does at a coronation procession or at the\r\nKing going in state to open Parliament. The Venetian loved splendour and\r\nbeauty and the story of the city's great achievements, and nothing\r\nprovided so welcome a subject for the decoration of the great public\r\nhalls as portrayals of the events which had made Venice famous. Artists\r\nhad been employed to produce these as early as the end of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, and those of the Bellini and Alvise Vivarini (which perished in\r\nthe great fire) were a rendering on modern lines of the same subjects,\r\nsatisfying the more advanced feeling for truth and beauty.\r\n\r\nBesides the Church and the public Government, we have already seen the\r\n\"Schools,\" as they were called, becoming important employers. These\r\nschools were the great organised confraternities in the cause of charity\r\nand mutual help, which sprang up in Venice in the fifteenth century.\r\nThat of St. Mark was naturally the foremost, but others were banded each\r\nunder their patron saint. Each attracted numbers of rich patrons, for it\r\nwas the fashion to belong to the confraternities. Riches and endowments\r\nrolled in, and halls for meeting and for transacting business were\r\nbuilt, and were adorned with pictures setting forth the legends of\r\ntheir patron saints. We have already seen Gentile Bellini employed in\r\nthe schools of San Marco and San Giovanni, and now the schools of St.\r\nUrsula and St. George gave commissions to Carpaccio, or perhaps it would\r\nbe more correct to say that Gentile, having become pre-eminent in this\r\nart, provided employment for his pupil and assistant, and that by\r\ndegrees Carpaccio became a _maestro_ on his own account.\r\n\r\nA host of second-rate painters were plying side by side, disciples\r\nfirst of one master, then drawn off to become followers of a second;\r\nassimilating the influence first of one workshop and then of another.\r\nCarpaccio has been lately identified as a pupil of Lazzaro Bastiani, who\r\nhad a school in Venice, and the recent attribution to this painter of\r\nthe \"Doge before the Madonna,\" in the National Gallery, gives some\r\ncountenance to the contention that he was held to be of great excellence\r\nin his time.\r\n\r\nThough some historians advance the suggestion that Carpaccio was a\r\nnative of Capo d'Istria, there is little proof that he was not, like his\r\nfather Pietro, born a Venetian. He seems to have worked in Venice all\r\nhis life, his first work being dated 1490 and his last 1520. In 1527 his\r\nwife, Laura, declared herself a widow.\r\n\r\nThe narrative art needed by the confraternities was supplied in\r\nperfection by Carpaccio, and one of his earliest independent\r\ncommissions was the important one of decorating the School of St.\r\nUrsula. Devotion to St. Ursula was a monopoly of the school. No one else\r\nhad a right to collect offerings in her name or to put up an image to\r\nher. The legend afforded an opportunity for painting varied and dramatic\r\nscenes, of which Carpaccio takes full advantage, and the cycle is one of\r\nthe freshest and most characteristic things that has come down to us\r\nfrom the quattrocento. Problems are not conspicuous. The mediocre\r\nmasters who have educated the painter have made little impression on\r\nhim. He is entirely occupied in delight in his subject and in telling\r\nhis story. The story of St. Ursula, told briefly, is that she was the\r\ndaughter of the King of Brittany. The King of England sends his\r\nambassadors to beg her hand for his son, Hereo. Ursula discusses the\r\nproposal with her father, and makes the conditions that Hereo, who is a\r\nheathen, shall be baptized, and that the betrothed couple must before\r\nmarriage visit the Pope and the sacred shrines. After taking leave of\r\ntheir parents, the Prince and Princess depart on their expedition, but\r\nUrsula has had a vision in her sleep in which an angel has announced her\r\nmartyrdom. She is accompanied on her journey by 11,000 virgins, and they\r\nare received by Pope Cyriacus in Rome. The Pope then makes the return\r\njourney with them as far as Cologne, where, however, they are assaulted\r\nand massacred by the Huns, after which Ursula is accorded a splendid\r\nfuneral, and is canonised. The thirteen scenes in which the story is\r\ntold are arranged on nine canvases, and the painter has not executed\r\nthem in the chronological order, some of the latest events being the\r\nleast complete in artistic skill. Professor Leonello Venturi assigns the\r\nfollowing dates to the list:\r\n\r\n     1. The ambassadors of the King of England meet those of the\r\n     King of Brittany to ask for the hand of Ursula. Probably\r\n     painted from 1496-98.\r\n\r\n     2. (On same canvas) Ursula discusses the proposal with her\r\n     father. 1496-98.\r\n\r\n     3. The King of Brittany dismisses the ambassadors. 1496-98.\r\n\r\n     4. The ambassadors return to the King of England. 1496-98.\r\n\r\n     5. An angel appears to Ursula in her sleep. 1492.\r\n\r\n     6, 7, 8. The betrothed couple take leave of their respective\r\n     parents, and the Prince meets Ursula. 1495.\r\n\r\n     9. The betrothed couple and the 11,000 virgins meet the Pope.\r\n     1492.\r\n\r\n     10. They arrive at Cologne. 1490.\r\n\r\n     11, 12. The massacre by the Huns. The Funeral. 1495.\r\n\r\n     13. The saint appears in glory, with the palm of martyrdom,\r\n     venerated by the 11,000 virgins and received in heaven by the\r\n     Eternal Father. 1491.\r\n\r\nNo. 10 is a small canvas, such as might naturally have been chosen for a\r\nfirst experiment. The heads are large with coarse features, and the\r\nproportions of the figures are poor. The face of the saint in glory (No.\r\n13), plump and without much expression, is of the type of Bastiani's\r\nsaints. It may be assumed that such a great scheme of decoration would\r\nnot have been entrusted to any one who was not already well known as an\r\nindependent master, but perhaps Carpaccio, who would have been about\r\nthirty when the work was begun, was still principally engrossed with the\r\nconventional, ecclesiastical subject. The heads of the virgins pressing\r\nround the saint appear to be portraits, and were very possibly those of\r\nthe wives and daughters of members of the confraternity.\r\n\r\nThe improvement that takes place is so rapid that we can guess how\r\ncongenial the painter found the task and how quickly he adapted his\r\nalready trained talent. In No. 5 he takes delight in the opportunity for\r\npainting a little domestic scene,--the bedroom of a young Venetian girl,\r\nperhaps a sister of his own. The comfortable bed, the dainty furniture,\r\nare carefully drawn. The clear morning light streams into the room. The\r\nsaint lies peacefully asleep, her hand under her head, her long\r\neyelashes resting upon her cheek: the whole is an idyll, full of insight\r\ninto girlish life. The tiny slippers made, no doubt, one of the details\r\nthat caught his eye. The crown lying on the ledge of the bed is an\r\narbitrary introduction, as naïf as the angel. In the funeral scene the\r\nluminous light is diffused over all, the young saint lies upon her bier\r\nand is followed by priest and deacon, the crowd is composed with truth\r\nto nature, the draperies and garments are brought into harmony with the\r\nsky and background, and in all those that follow we find this quality\r\nof light. The landscape behind the massacre has gained in natural\r\ncharacter, the city is at some distance, houses and churches are half\r\nburied in woods; the setting is much more natural than are the quaint\r\nand elegant pages who occupy it, and who are drawing their crossbows and\r\nattacking the martyrs with leisurely nonchalance. The panel in which the\r\nbetrothed couple meet shows a great advance, and this and the succeeding\r\nones of the ambassadors, which were painted between 1495 and 1498, must\r\nhave crowned Carpaccio's reputation. He paints Venice in its most\r\nfascinating aspect; the enamelled beauty of its marbles, its sky and\r\nsea, its palaces and ships, the rich and picturesque dresses men wore\r\nin the streets, the barge glowing with rich velvets. He evinces a\r\nfairy-tale spirit which we may compare with the work of Pintoricchio.\r\nHis Prince, kneeling in a white and gold dress, with long fair curls, is\r\na real fairy prince; Ursula, in her red dress and puffed sleeves, her\r\nrippling, flaxen hair and strings of pearls, is a princess of story.\r\nCarpaccio's art is simple and garrulous in feeling, his conception is\r\nas unpassionate as the fancies of a child, but he has a true love for\r\nthese gay crowds; Venice going upon her gallant way--her solid, worthy\r\ncitizens, men of substance, shrewd and valuable, taking their pleasure\r\nseriously with a sense of responsibility. They throng the streets and\r\ncross over the bridges, every figure is full of freedom and vitality.\r\nThe arrival and dismissal of the ambassadors are the best of all the\r\nscenes. In the middle of the great stage King Maurus of Brittany sits\r\nupon a Venetian terrace. In the colonnade to the left is gathered a\r\ngroup of Venetian personages, members of the Loredano family, which was\r\na special patron of St. Ursula's Guild, and gave this panel. The types\r\nare all vividly realised and differentiated: the courtier looking\r\ncritically at the arrivals; the frankly curious bourgeoisie; the man\r\nof fashion passing with his nose in the air, disdaining to stare too\r\nclosely; the fop with his dogs and their dwarf keeper. Far beyond\r\nstretch the lagoons; the sea and air of Venice clear and fresh. What is\r\nnoticeable even now in an Italian crowd, the absence of women, was then\r\nmost true to life, for except on special occasions they were not seen in\r\nthe streets, but were kept in almost Oriental seclusion. The dismissal\r\nof the ambassadors affords the opportunity for drawing an interior with\r\nthe street visible through a doorway. A group at the side, of a man\r\ndictating a letter and the scribe taking down his words, writing\r\nlaboriously, with his shoulders hunched and his head on one side, is\r\nexcellent in its quiet reality. The same life-like vivacity is displayed\r\nin Ursula's consultation with her father. The old nurse crouched upon\r\nthe steps is introduced to break the line and to throw back the main\r\ngroup. Carpaccio has already used such a figure in the funeral scene,\r\nand Titian himself adopts his suggestion.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Carpaccio._\r\n                 ARRIVAL OF THE AMBASSADORS.\r\n                _Venice._\r\n                 (_Photo, Anderson._)]\r\n\r\nCarpaccio is not a very great painter, but a charming one. His treatment\r\nof light and water, of distant hills and trees, shows a sense of peace\r\nand poetry, and though he is influenced by Gentile's splendid realistic\r\nheads, the type which appeals to him is gentler and more idealised. His\r\nfancy is caught by Oriental details, to which Gentile would naturally\r\nhave directed his attention, and of which there was no lack in Venice at\r\nthis time. All his episodes are very clearly illustrated, and his\r\npopular brush was kept busily employed. He took a share with other\r\nassistants in the series which Gentile was painting in S. Giovanni\r\nEvangelista. In 1502 the Dalmatians inhabiting Venice resolved to\r\ndecorate their school, which had been founded fifty years earlier, for\r\nthe relief of destitute Dalmatian seamen in Venice. The subjects were\r\nto be selected from the lives of the Saviour and the patron saints of\r\nDalmatia and Albania, St. Jerome, St. George of the Sclavonians, and St.\r\nTryphonius. The nine panels and an altarpiece which Carpaccio delivered\r\nbetween 1502 and 1508 still adorn the small but dignified Hall of the\r\nschool. His \"Jerome in his Study\" has nothing ascetic, but shows a\r\nprosperous Venetian ecclesiastic seated in his well-furnished library\r\namong his books and writings. He is less successful in his scenes from\r\nthe life of Christ; the Gethsemane is an obvious imitation of Mantegna;\r\nbut when he leaves his own style he is weak and poor, and imaginary\r\nscenes are quite beyond him. In the death and interment of St. Jerome he\r\ngives a delightful impression of the peace of the old convent garden,\r\nand in the scene where the lion introduced by the saint scatters the\r\nterrified monks he lets a sense of humour have free play. The monks in\r\ntheir long garments, escaping in all directions, are really comical, and\r\nin conjunction with the ingratiating smile of the lion, the scene passes\r\ninto the region of broad farce. We divine the same sense of the comic in\r\nthe scene in St. Ursula's history, where the 11,000 virgins are hurrying\r\nin single file along a winding road which disappears out of the picture.\r\nIn the principal scene in the life of St. George, Carpaccio again\r\nachieves a masterpiece. The force and vivacity of the saint in armour\r\ncharging the dragon, lingers long in the memory. The long, decorative\r\nlines of lance and war-horse and dragon throw back the whole landscape.\r\nThe details show an almost childish delight in the realisation of\r\nghoulish horrors. He rather injures his \"Triumph of St. George\" by his\r\nanxiety to bring in the Temple of Solomon at Jerusalem; the flying flags\r\ndistract the eye, and the whole scene is one of confusion, broken up\r\ninto different parts, while the dragon is reduced to very unterrifying\r\ninsignificance. His series for the school of the Albanians dealt with\r\nthe life of the Virgin, who was their special patron. Its remains are\r\nat Bergamo, Milan, and in the Academy. The single figures in the\r\n\"Presentation,\" the priest and maiden, are excellent. A child at the\r\nside of the steps, leading a unicorn, emblem of chastity, shows once\r\nmore what a hold this use of a figure had taken of him. In the\r\n\"Visitation\" the figures are too much scattered, and the fantastic\r\nbuildings attract more attention than the women. He still produced\r\naltarpieces, and the Presentation of the Infant Christ in the Temple,\r\nwhich he was called upon to paint for San Giobbe, where one of Bellini's\r\nmost famous altarpieces stood, challenged him to put forth all his\r\nstrength. He never produced anything more simple and noble or more\r\nworthy of the cinque-cento than this altarpiece (now in the Academy). It\r\nsurpasses Bellini's arrangement in the way in which the personages are\r\nraised upon a step, while the dome overhead and the angel musicians\r\nbelow give them height and dignity. The contrast between the infant and\r\nthe youthful woman and the old men is purposely marked. Such a contrast\r\nbetween youth and age is a very favourite one. Bellini, in the same\r\nchurch, draws it between SS. Sebastian and Job, and Alvise Vivarini, in\r\nhis last painting, balances a very youthful Sebastian with St. Jerome.\r\nThis is the most grandiose, the least of a _genre_ picture of all\r\nCarpaccio's creations, although he does make Simeon into a pontiff with\r\nattendant cardinals bearing his train. One of his last works is the S.\r\nVitale over the high altar of the church of that name, where we forgive\r\nthe wooden appearance of the horse which the saint rides for the sake of\r\nthe simple dignity of the rider and the airy effect given by the balcony\r\noverhead. Nor must we forget that study of the \"Two Courtesans\" in the\r\nMuseo Civico, full of the sarcasm of a deep realism. It conveys to us\r\nthe matter-of-fact monotony of the long, hot days, and the women and the\r\nanimals with which they are beguiling their idle hours are painted with\r\nthe greatest intelligence. It carries us back to another phase of life\r\nin Carpaccio's Venice, seen through his observant, humorous eyes, and if\r\nthere is nothing in his colour distinctive of the impending Venetian\r\nrichness, it is still arresting in its brilliant limpidity; it seems\r\ndrawn straight from the transparent canals and radiant lagoons.\r\n\r\nWe apprehend the difference at once in Bastiani and in Mansueti, who\r\nessay the same sort of compositions. They studied grouping carefully,\r\nand it must have seemed easy enough to paint their careful architecture\r\nand to place citizens in costume with appropriate action in a \"Miracle\r\nof the Cross,\" or the \"Preaching of St. Mark\"; but these pictures are\r\ndry and crowded, they give no illusion of truth, there is none of the\r\ncareless realism of Carpaccio's crowds,--of incidents taking place which\r\nare not essential to the story, and, as in life, are only half seen, but\r\nwhich have their share in producing a full and varied illusion. The\r\nscenes want the air and depth in which Carpaccio's pictures are\r\nenveloped. We are not stimulated and charmed, taken into the outer air\r\nand refreshed by these heavy personages, standing in rows, painted in\r\nhot, dry colour, and carrying no conviction in their glance and action.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\r\n\r\n Berlin.

Bellini and his accomplished brother, that\r\nwhich makes us so conscious that the first was the greater of the two\r\nand which sets him in a later artistic generation than Gentile, is a\r\ndifference of mind. Such pageant-pictures as we hear that Giovanni\r\nwas engaged upon have all been destroyed. We may suspect that their\r\ncomposition was not particularly congenial to him, and that the strictly\r\nreligious pictures and the small allegorical studies, by which we must\r\njudge him, were more after his heart. It is his poetic and ideal feeling\r\nwhich adds so strongly to his claim to be a great artist; it was this\r\nwhich drew all men to him and enabled him so powerfully to influence the\r\nart of his day in Venice.\r\n\r\nJacopo's wife, Anna, in a will of 1429, leaves everything to her two\r\nsons, Gentile and Niccolo. Giovanni was evidently not her son, but\r\nVasari speaks of him as the elder of the two, so that it is very\r\npossible that he was an illegitimate child, brought up, after the\r\nfashion that so often obtained, in the full privileges of his father's\r\nhouse. Documents show that Jacopo Bellini was living in Venice in 1437,\r\nfirst near the Piazza, and afterwards in the parish of San Lio. He was a\r\nmember of S. Giovanni Evangelista, and probably one of the leading\r\nartists of the city. His two sons helped him in his great decorative\r\nworks, and also went with him to Padua, where he painted the Gattamalata\r\nChapel. Their relative position is suggested by a document of 1457,\r\nwhich records that the father received twenty-one ducats for \"three\r\nfigures, done on cloth, put in the Great Hall of the Patriarch,\" only\r\ntwo of which were to go to the son. In 1459 Gian. Bellini's signature\r\nfirst appears on a document, and at about this time we may suppose that\r\nhe and his brother began to execute small commissions on their own\r\naccount. On these visits to Padua the intimacy must have sprung up,\r\nwhich led to Mantegna's marriage in 1453 with Jacopo's daughter. At\r\nPadua, too, Bellini, in company with Mantegna, drank in the inspiration\r\nleft there by Donatello, the greatest master that either of them\r\nencountered. It was the humanistic and naturalistic side of Donatello\r\nwhich touched Giovanni Bellini, more than all his classic lore. It\r\nchimed in, too, with his father's graceful and fanciful quality, and\r\nthere is no doubt that the Venetian painters soon exercised a marked\r\ninfluence on Mantegna. They \"fought for him with Squarcione,\" and even\r\nin the Eremitani frescoes he begins to lose his purely statuesque type\r\nand to become frankly Renaissance. In the later scenes of the series a\r\npergola with grapes, a Venetian campanile and doorway replace his\r\nclassic towers and arches of triumph. In the \"Martyrdom of St. James\"\r\nthe couple walking by and paying no attention whatever to the tragic\r\nevent, are very like the people whom Gentile introduces in his\r\nbackgrounds.\r\n\r\nThere are few documents more interesting in the history of art\r\nthan the two pictures of the \"Agony in the Garden,\" executed by the\r\nbrothers-in-law, about 1455, from a design by Jacopo in the British\r\nMuseum sketch-book. Jacopo draws the mound-like hill, Christ kneeling\r\nbefore the vision of the Chalice, the figures wrapt in slumber, and the\r\ndistant town. In few pictures up to this time is the landscape conceived\r\nin such sympathy with the figures. As we look at this sketch and examine\r\nthe two finished compositions, which it is so fortunate to find in\r\njuxtaposition in the National Gallery, we surmise that the two artists\r\nagreed to carry out the same idea and each to give his version of\r\nJacopo's suggestion, and very curious it is to see the rendering each\r\nhas produced.\r\n\r\nMantegna has made use of the most formal and Squarcionesque contours in\r\nhis surroundings. The rocks are of an unnatural, geological structure.\r\nThe towers of Jerusalem are defined in elaborate perspective, and a band\r\nof classic figures fills the middle distance. The sleeping forms of the\r\ndisciples are laid about like so many draped statues taken from their\r\npedestals. The choir of child angels is solid and leaves nothing to the\r\nimagination, and if it were not for the beautifully conceived Christ,\r\nthe whole composition would leave us quite unmoved. On the other hand,\r\nwe can never look at Bellini's version without a fresh thrill. He, like\r\nMantegna, has followed Jacopo's scheme of winding roads and the city\r\n\"set on a hill,\" and has drawn the advancing band of soldiers; but,\r\nindependent of all details, he gives us the vision of a poet. The still\r\ndawn is breaking over the broadly painted landscape, the rosy shafts of\r\nlight are colouring the sky and casting their magic over every common\r\nobject, and, lonely and absorbed, the Sacred Figure kneels, wrapt into\r\nthe Heavenly Vision, which is hardly more definite than a stronger\r\nbeam of light upon the radiance. One of the disciples, at least, is a\r\nsuccessful and natural study of a tired-out man, whose head has fallen\r\nback and whose every limb has relaxed in sleep. Bellini is less assured,\r\nless accomplished than Mantegna, but he is able to touch us with the\r\npathos of both natural and spiritual feeling.\r\n\r\nEven earlier than this picture, critics place the \"Crucifixion\" and\r\n\"Transfiguration\" of the Museo Correr and our own \"Salvator Mundi.\" In\r\n1443, when Giovanni was a young man of four or five and twenty, San\r\nBernardino had held a great revival at Padua, and the whole of Venice\r\nhad thronged to hear him. It is very possible, as Mr. Roger Fry suggests\r\nin his _Life of Bellini_, that Giovanni's emotional temperament had been\r\nworked upon by the preacher's eloquence, and the very poignant feelings\r\nof love and pity which his early art expresses were the deliberate\r\nconsequence of his sympathy with the deep religious mysteries expounded.\r\n\r\nIn the two pictures in the Correr, Bellini is still going with the\r\nPaduan current. In both we have the winding roads so characteristic of\r\nhis father, but the rocks in the \"Transfiguration\" have the jointed,\r\narbitrary character of Mantegna's and the draperies are plastered to the\r\nforms beneath; yet the figures here have a beauty and a dignity which no\r\nreproduction seems able to convey. The feeling is already more imposing\r\nthan the execution. Christ and the two prophets tower up against the\r\nbelt of clouds, the central figure conveying a sense of pathetic\r\nisolation; while below, St. John's attitude betrays a state of tension,\r\nthe feet being drawn up and contorted. This picture prepares us for the\r\noverwhelming emotion we find in the \"Redeemer\" and the group of Pietàs.\r\nThe treatment of the Christ was a development of the early _motif_ of\r\nangels flying forward on either side of the Cross, but here the sacred\r\nblood pouring into the chalice is also sacramental and connected with\r\nthe intensified religious fervour which had led to the foundation of\r\nthe Franciscan and Dominican orders, illustrations of which are met\r\nwith in the miniatures and wood-engravings of fifteenth-century books\r\nof devotion. The accessories, the antique reliefs, the low wall, the\r\ndistant buildings, have an allegorical meaning underlying each one, and\r\ncommon to trecento and, in a less degree, to quattrocento art. Paradise\r\nregained is signified by the paved court with the open door, in\r\ncontradistinction to the Hortus Clausus, or enclosed court; the type of\r\nthe old covenant. In one of the bas-reliefs Mucius Scaevola thrusts his\r\nhand into the fire, the ancient type of heroic readiness to suffer. The\r\nother represents a pagan sacrifice, foreshadowing the sacrifice upon the\r\nCross. Figures in the background are leaving a ruined temple and making\r\ntheir way towards the new Christian city, fortified and crowned with a\r\nchurch tower, and in the midst of all this symbolism, Christ and the\r\nattendant angel are placed, vibrating with nervous feeling.\r\n\r\nDuring the next few years, Bellini devoted himself to two subjects of\r\nthe highest devotional order. These are the Madonna and Child, the great\r\nexercise in every age for painters, and the Pietà, which he has made\r\npeculiarly his own.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Giovanni Bellini._\r\n                 PIETÀ.\r\n                _Brera, Milan._\r\n                 (_Photo, Brogi._)]\r\n\r\nClose by, at Padua, Giotto had left a rendering of the last subject, so\r\nfull of passionate sorrow that it is hardly possible that it should not,\r\nif only half consciously, have stimulated the artistic sensibilities\r\nof the most sensitive of painters; but Bellini's pathos shrinks from\r\nall exaggeration. He conceives grief with the tenderest insight. His\r\ninterest in the subject was so intense that he never left the execution\r\nto others, and though not a single one bears his signature, yet each is\r\nentirely by his own hand. Besides the Pietà at Milan, which is perhaps\r\nthe best known, there is one in the Correr Museum, another in the Doge's\r\nPalace, and yet others at Rimini and at Berlin. The version he adopts,\r\nwhich places the Body of Christ within the sarcophagus, was a favourite\r\nin North Italy. Donatello uses it in a bas-relief (now in the Victoria\r\nand Albert Museum), but whether he brought or found the suggestion in\r\nPadua nothing exists to show. Jacopo has left sketches in which the\r\nwhole group is within the tomb, and this rendering is followed by\r\nCarpaccio, Crivelli, Marco Zoppo, and others. It is never found in\r\ntrecento art, and is probably traceable to the Paduan impulse to make\r\nuse of classic remains.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Bellini's Pietàs fall into two groups. In one, the Christ is\r\nplaced between the Virgin and St. John, who are embodiments of the agony\r\nof bereavement. In the other, the dead Redeemer is supported by angels,\r\nwho express the amazement and grief of immortal beings who see their\r\nLord suffering an indignity from which they are immune.\r\n\r\nMary and St. John _inside_ the sarcophagus shows that they are conceived\r\nmystically; Mary as the Church, and St. John as the personification of\r\nChristian Philosophy--a significance frequently attached to these\r\nfigures. Such a picture was designed to hang over the altar, at which\r\nthe mystical sacrifice of the Mass was perpetually offered.\r\n\r\nIn his treatment of the Brera example Bellini has shaken off the Paduan\r\ntradition, and is forming his own style and giving free play to his own\r\nfeeling. The winding roads and evening sky, barred with clouds, are the\r\naccessories he used in the \"Agony in the Garden,\" but the figures are\r\ntreated much more boldly; the drapery falls in broad masses, and\r\nscarcely a trace is left of sculpturesque treatment. Careful as is the\r\nstudy of the nude, everything is subordinated to the emotion expressed\r\nby the three figures: the helpless, indifferent calm of the dead, the\r\ntender solicitude of the Mother, the wandering, dazed look of the\r\ndespairing friend. Here there is nothing of beautiful or pathetic\r\nsymbol; the group is intense with the common sorrow of all the world.\r\nMary presses the corpse to her as if to impart her own life, and gazes\r\nwith anguished yearning on the beloved face. Bellini seems to have\r\npassed to a more complex age in his analysis of suffering, yet here is\r\nnone of the extravagance which the primitive masters share with the\r\nCaracci: his restraint is as admirable as his intensity.\r\n\r\nIn the Rimini version the tender concern and questioning surprise of the\r\nattendant angels contrast with the inert weight of the beautiful dead\r\nbody they support. Their childish limbs and butterfly wings make a\r\nsinuous pattern against the lacquered black of the ground-work, and Mr.\r\nRoger Fry makes the interesting suggestion that the effect, reminiscent\r\nof Greek vase-painting, and the likeness of the Head of Christ to an old\r\nbronze, may, in a composition painted for Sigismondo Malatesta, be no\r\nmere accident, but a concession to the patron's enthusiasm for classic\r\nart.\r\n\r\nIn 1470 Bellini received his first commission in the Scuola di San\r\nMarco. Gentile had been employed there since 1466 on the history of the\r\nIsraelites in the desert. Bellini agreed to paint \"The Deluge and the\r\nArk of Noah\" with all its attendant circumstances, but of these,\r\nexcept from Vasari's descriptions, we can form no idea. These great\r\npageant-pictures had become identified with the Bellini and their\r\nfollowing, while the production of altarpieces was peculiarly the\r\nprovince of the Vivarini. Here Bellini effected a change, for sacred\r\nsubjects best suited the restrained and simple perfection of his style,\r\nand afforded the most sympathetic opening for his idealistic spirit. For\r\nthe next twenty years or more, however, he was unavoidably absorbed in\r\npublic work, for we hear of his being given the direction of that which\r\nGentile left unfinished in the Ducal Palace when he went to the East in\r\n1479. In 1492, Giovanni being ill, Gentile superintended the work for\r\nhim, and in that year he was appointed to paint in the Hall of the Grand\r\nCouncil, at an annual salary of sixty ducats. Other commissions were\r\nturned out of the _bottega_ he had set up with his brother in 1471, and\r\nbetween that year and 1480 he went to Pesaro to paint the important\r\naltarpiece that still holds its place there. It is in some ways the\r\ngreatest and most powerful thing that Bellini ever accomplished. The\r\ncentral figures and the attendant saints have a large gravity and\r\ncarefully studied individuality. St. Jerome, absorbed in his theological\r\nbooks, an ascetic recluse, is admirably contrasted with the sympathetic,\r\ncultured St. Paul. The landscape, set in a marble frame, is a gem of\r\nbeauty, and proves what an appeal nature was making to the painter. The\r\npredella, illustrating the principal scenes in the lives of the saints\r\naround the altar, is full of Oriental costumes. The horses are small\r\nEastern horses, very unlike the ponderous Italian war-horse, and the\r\nwhole is evidently inspired by the sketches which Gentile brought back\r\non his return from Constantinople in 1481.\r\n\r\nLooking from one to another of the cycle of Madonna pictures which\r\nBellini produced, and of which so many hang side by side in the Academy,\r\nwe are able to note how his conception varied. In one of the earliest\r\nthe Child lies across its Mother's knee, in the attitude borrowed from\r\nhis father and the Vivarini, from whom, too, he takes the uplifted\r\nhands, placed palm to palm. The earlier pictures are of the gentle and\r\nadoring type, but his later Madonnas are stately Venetian ladies. He\r\ngives us a queenly woman, with full throat and stately poise, in the\r\nMadonna degli Alberi, in which the two little trees are symbols of the\r\nOld and New Testament; or, again, he paints a lovely intellectual face\r\nwith chiselled and refined features, and sad dark eyes, and contrasts it\r\ndramatically with the bluff St. George in armour; and there is another\r\nMadonna between St. Francis and St. Catherine, a picture which has a\r\ncurious effect of artificial light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nGIOVANNI BELLINI (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1497 the Maggior Consiglio of the Venetian Republic appointed Bellini\r\nsuperintendent of the Great Hall, and conferred on him the honourable\r\ntitle of State Painter. In this capacity he was the overseer of all\r\npublic works of painting, and was expected to devote a part of his\r\ntime to the decoration of the Hall. Sansovino enumerates nine of\r\nhis historical paintings, which had been painted before the State\r\nappointment, all having reference to the visit of Pope Alexander; but\r\nthough he must have been much engrossed, he seems to have suspended the\r\nwork from time to time, for between 1485 and 1488 he painted the large\r\naltarpiece in the Frari, that at San Pietro in Murano, and the one in\r\nthe Academy, which was painted for San Giobbe. Of these three, the last\r\nshows the greatest advance and is fullest of experiment. The Madonna is\r\na grand ecclesiastical figure. It has been said with truth that it is\r\na picture which must have afforded great support and dignity to the\r\nChurch. The Infant has an expression of omniscience, and the Mother\r\ngazes out of the picture, extending invitation and encouragement to the\r\nadvancing worshippers. The religious feeling is less profound; the\r\nartist has been more absorbed in the contrast between the beautiful,\r\nyouthful body of St. Sebastian and that of St. Giobbe, older but not\r\nemaciated, and with the exquisite surface that his now complete mastery\r\nof oil-painting enabled him to produce. This technique has evidently\r\nbeen a great delight, and is here carried to perfection; the skin of\r\nSt. Sebastian gleams with a gloss like the coat of a horse in high\r\ncondition. Everything that architecture, sculpture, and rich material\r\ncan supply is borrowed to enhance the grandeur of the group; but the\r\nline of sight is still close to the bottom of the picture, and if it\r\nwere not for the exquisite grace with which the angels are placed, the\r\nMadonna would have a broad, clumsy effect. The Madonna of the Frari is\r\nthe most splendid in colour of all his works. As he paints the rich\r\nlight of a golden interior and the fused and splendid colours, he seems\r\nto pass out of his own time and gives a foretaste of the glory that is\r\nto follow. The Murano altarpiece is quite a different conception;\r\ninstead of the seclusion of the sanctuary, it is a smiling, _plein air_\r\nscene: the Mother benign, the Child soft and playful, the old Doge\r\nBarbarigo and the patron saints kneeling among bright birds, and a\r\ngarden and mediæval townlet filling up the background, for which, by the\r\nway, he uses the same sketch as in the Pesaro picture. It says much for\r\nhis versatility that he could within a short time produce three such\r\ndifferent versions.\r\n\r\nAmong Bellini's most fascinating achievements in the last years of the\r\nfifteenth century are his allegorical paintings, known to us by the\r\n\"Pélerinage de l'Âme\" in the Uffizi and the little series in the\r\nAcademy. The meaning of the first has been unravelled by Dr. Ludwig from\r\na mediæval poem by Guillaume de Guilleville, a Cistercian monk who wrote\r\nabout 1335, and it is interesting to see the hold it has taken on\r\nBellini's mystic spirit. The paved space, set within the marble rail,\r\nsignifies, as in the \"Salvator Mundi,\" the Paradise where souls await\r\nthe Resurrection. The new-born souls cluster round the Tree of Life and\r\nshake its boughs. The poem says:\r\n\r\n    There is no pilgrim who is not sometimes sad\r\n    Who has not those who wound his heart,\r\n    And to whom it is not often necessary\r\n    To play and be solaced\r\n    And be soothed like a child\r\n    With something comforting.\r\n    Know that those playing\r\n    There in order to allay their sorrow\r\n    Have found beneath that tree\r\n    An apple that great comfort gives\r\n    To those that play with it.[2]\r\n\r\n [2] This translation is by Miss Cameron Taylor.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Giovanni Bellini._\r\n                 AN ALLEGORY.\r\n                _Florence._\r\n                 (_Photo, Anderson._)]\r\n\r\nThis may be an allusion to sacramental comfort. St. Peter and St. Paul\r\nguard the door, beside which the Madonna and a saint sit in holy\r\nconversation. A very beautiful figure on the left, wrapped in a black\r\nshawl, requires explanation, and it has been suggested that it is the\r\ndonor, a woman who may have lost husband and children, and who, still in\r\nlife, is introduced, watching the happiness of the souls in Paradise.\r\nSS. Giobbe and Sebastian, who might have stepped out of the San Giobbe\r\naltarpiece, are obviously the patron saints of the family, and St.\r\nCatherine, at the Virgin's side, may be the donor's own saint. This\r\npicture, with its delicious landscape bathed in atmospheric light,\r\nis a forerunner of those Giorgionesque compositions of \"pure and\r\nunquestioning delight in the sensuous charm of rare and beautiful\r\nthings\" in which the artistic nature is even more engrossed than with\r\nthe intellectual conception, and within its small space Bellini seems to\r\nhave enshrined all his artistic creed. The allegories in the Academy are\r\nalso full of meaning. They are decorative works, and were probably\r\npainted for some small cabinet. They seem too small for a cassone. They\r\nare ruined by over-painting, but still full of grace and fancy. The\r\nfigure in the classic chariot, bearing fruit, in the encounter between\r\nLuxury and Industry, is drawn from Jacopo's triumphant Bacchus. Fortune\r\nfloats in her barque, holding the globe, and the souls who gather round\r\nher are some full of triumphant success, others clinging to her for\r\ncomfort, while several are sinking, overwhelmed in the dark waters.\r\n\"Prudence,\" the only example of a female nude in Bellini's works, holds\r\na looking-glass. Hypocrisy or Calumny is torn writhing from his refuge.\r\nThe Summa Virtus is an ugly representation of all the virtues; a\r\nwaddling deformity with eyes bound holds the scales of justice; the\r\npitcher in its hand means prudence, and the gold upon its feet\r\nsymbolises charity. The landscape, both of this and of the \"Fortune,\"\r\nresembles that which he was painting in his larger works at the end of\r\nthe century. Soon after 1501 Bellini entered into relations with Isabela\r\nd'Este, Marchioness of Gonzaga. That distinguished collector and\r\nconnoisseur writes through her agent to get the promise of a picture,\r\n\"a story or fable of antiquity,\" to be placed in position with the\r\nallegories which Mantegna had contributed to her \"Paradiso.\" Bellini\r\nagreed to supply this, and received twenty-five ducats on account. He\r\nseems, however, to have felt that he would be at a disadvantage in\r\ncompeting with Mantegna on his own ground, and asks to be allowed to\r\nchoose his subject. Isabela was unwillingly obliged to content herself\r\nwith a sacred picture, and a \"Nativity\" was selected. She is at once\r\nfull of suggestions, desiring to add a St. John Baptist, whom Bellini\r\ndemurs at introducing except as a child, but in April 1504 the\r\ncommission is still unaccomplished, and Isabela angrily demands the\r\nreturn of her money. This brings a letter of humble apology from\r\nBellini, and presently the picture is forwarded. Lorenzo of Pavia writes\r\nthat it is quite beautiful, and that \"though Giovanni has behaved as\r\nbadly as possible, yet the bad must be taken with the good.\" The joy of\r\nits acquisition appeased Isabela, who at once began to lay plans to get\r\na further work out of Bellini, and in 1505 Bembo wrote to her that he\r\nwould take a fresh commission always providing he might fix the subject.\r\nFrom the catalogue of her Mantovan pictures we gather that the picture\r\n\"sul asse\" (on panel) represented the \"B.V., il Putto, S. Giovanni\r\nBattista, S. Giovanni Evangelista, S. Girolamo, and Santa Caterina.\"\r\n\r\nThe great altarpieces which remain strike us less by their research,\r\ntheir preoccupation with new problems of paint or grouping, than by\r\ntheir intense delight in beauty. Bellini was now nearly eighty years\r\nold, and in 1504 the young Giorgione had proclaimed a revolution in art\r\nwith his Castelfranco Madonna. In composition and detail the Madonna\r\nof San Zaccaria is in some degree a protest against the Arcadian,\r\ninnovating fashion of approaching a religious scene, of which the Church\r\nhad long since decided on the treatment, yet Bellini cannot escape the\r\nindirect suggestion of the new manner. The same leaven was at work in\r\nhim which was transforming the men of a younger generation. In this\r\naltarpiece, in the Baptism at Vicenza, in others, perhaps, which have\r\nperished, and above all in the hermit saint in S. Giovanni Crisostomo he\r\nis linked in feeling and in treatment with the later Venetian School.\r\n\r\nThe new device, which he adopts quite naturally, of raising the line of\r\nsight, sets the figures in increased depth. For the first time he gives\r\nheight and majesty to the young Mother by carrying the draperies down\r\nover the steps. He realises to the full the contrast between the young,\r\nfragile heads of his girl-saints and the dark, venerable countenances of\r\nthe old men. The head of S. Lucy, detaching itself like a flower upon\r\nits stem, reminds us of the type which we saw in his Watcher in the\r\nsacred allegory of the Uffizi. The arched, dome-like niche opens on a\r\ndistance bathed in golden light. Bellini keeps the traditions of the\r\nold hieratic art, but he has grasped a new perfection of feeling and\r\natmosphere. Who the saints are matters little; it is the collective\r\nenjoyment of a company of congenial people that pleases us so much. The\r\n\"Baptism\" in S. Corona, at Vicenza, painted sixteen years later than\r\nCima's in S. Giovanni in Bragora, is in frank imitation of the younger\r\nman. Christ and the Baptist, traditional figures, are drawn without much\r\nzest, in a weak, conventional way, but the artist's true interest comes\r\nout in the beauty of face and gesture of the group of women holding the\r\ngarments, and above all in the sombre gloom of the distance, which\r\nreplaces Cima's charming landscape, and which keys the whole picture to\r\nthe significance of a portent. In the enthronement of the old hermit, S.\r\nChrysostom himself, painted in 1513, Bellini keeps his love for the\r\ngolden dome, but he lets us look through its arch, at rolling mountain\r\nsolitudes, with mists rising between their folds. The geranium robe of\r\nthe saint, an exquisite, vivid bit of colouring, is caught by the golden\r\nsunset rays, the fine ascetic head stands out against the evening sky,\r\nand in the faces of the two saints who stand on either side of the aged\r\nvisionary Bellini has gone back to all his old intensity of religious\r\nfeeling, a feeling which he seemed for a time to have exchanged for a\r\nmore pagan tone.\r\n\r\nIn 1507, at Gentile's death, Giovanni undertook, at his brother's\r\ndying request, to finish the \"Preaching of St. Mark,\" receiving as a\r\nrecompense that coveted sketch-book of his father's, from which he had\r\nadopted so many suggestions, and which, though he was the eldest, had\r\nbeen inherited by the legitimate son.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding year Albert Dürer had visited Venice for the second\r\ntime, and Bellini had received him with great cordiality. Dürer writes,\r\n\"Bellini is very old, but is still the best painter in Venice\"; and\r\nadds, \"The things I admired on my last visit, I now do not value at\r\nall.\" Implying that he was able now to see how superior Bellini was to\r\nthe hitherto more highly esteemed Vivarini.\r\n\r\nAt the very end of Bellini's life, in 1514, the Duke of Ferrara paid\r\nhim eighty-five ducats for a painting of \"Bacchanals,\" now at Alnwick\r\nCastle; which may be looked upon as an open confession by one who had\r\nalways considered himself as a painter of distinctively religious works,\r\nthat such a gay scene of feasting afforded opportunities which he could\r\nnot resist, for beauty of attitude and colour; but the gods, sitting at\r\ntheir banquet in a sunny glade, are almost fully draped, and there is\r\nlittle of the _abandon_ which was affected by later painters. The\r\npicture was left unfinished, and was later given to Titian to complete.\r\nIn his capacity as State Painter to the Republic, it was Bellini's duty\r\nto execute the official portraits of the Doges. During his long life he\r\nsaw eleven reigns, and during four he held the State appointment.\r\nBesides the official, he painted private portraits of the Doges, and\r\nthat of Doge Loredano, in the National Gallery, is one of the most\r\nperfect presentments of the quattrocento. This portrait, painted by one\r\nold man of another, shows no weakening in touch or characterisation. It\r\nis as brilliant and vigorous as it is direct and simple. The face is\r\nquiet and unexaggerated; there is no unnatural fire and feeling, but an\r\nair of accustomed dignity and thought, while the technique has all the\r\nperfection of the painter's prime.\r\n\r\nIn 1516 Giovanni was buried in the Church of SS. Giovanni and Paolo, by\r\nthe side of his brother Gentile. To the last he was popular and famous,\r\noverwhelmed with attentions from the most distinguished personages of\r\nthe city. Though he had begun life when art showed such a different\r\naspect, he was by nature so imbued with that temperament, which at the\r\ntime of his death was beginning to assert itself in the younger school,\r\nthat he was able to assimilate a really astonishing share of the new\r\nmanner. He is guided by feeling more than by intellect. All the time he\r\nis working out problems, he is dominated by the emotion of his subject,\r\nbut his emotion, his pathos, are invariably tempered and restrained by\r\nthe calm moderation of the quattrocento. The golden mean still has\r\ncommand of Bellini, and never allows his feelings, however poignant,\r\nto degenerate into sentimentality or violence.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\r\n\r\n Bergamo.

He was more popular and had a\r\nlarger following among the artists of his day than either Gentile or\r\nCarpaccio with their frankly mundane talent. Whatever Giovanni's State\r\nworks may have been, his religious paintings are the ones which are\r\ncopied and adapted and studied by the younger band of artists, and this\r\nbecause of their beauty and notwithstanding their conventional subjects.\r\nGentile's pageant-pictures have still something cold and colourless,\r\nwith a touch of the archaic, while Giovanni's religious altarpieces\r\nevince a new freedom of handling, a modern conception of beautiful\r\nwomen, a use of that colour which was soon to reign triumphant. As\r\nfar as it went indeed, its triumph was already assured; as Giovanni\r\nadvanced towards old age, it was no longer of any use for the young\r\nmasters of the day to paint in any way save the one he had made popular,\r\nand one artist after another who had begun in the school of Alvise\r\nVivarini ended as the disciple of Giovanni Bellini.\r\n\r\nIt was the habit of Bellini to trust much to his assistants, and as\r\neverything that went out of his workshop was signed by his name, even if\r\nit only represented the use of one of his designs, or a few words of\r\nadvice, and was \"passed\" by the master, it is no wonder that European\r\ncollections were flooded with works, among which only lately the names\r\nof Catena, Previtali, Pennacchi, Marco Belli, Bissolo, Basaiti,\r\nRondinelli, and others begin to be disentangled.\r\n\r\nOnly one of his followers stands out as a strong and original master,\r\nnot quite of the first class, but developing his own individuality while\r\nhe draws in much of what both Alvise and Bellini had to give. Cima da\r\nConegliano, whose real name was Giovanni Battista, always signs himself\r\n_Coneglianensis_: the title of Cima, \"the Rock,\" by which he is now so\r\nwidely known, having first been mentioned in the seventeenth century by\r\nBoschini, and perhaps given him by that writer himself. He was a son of\r\nthe mountains, who, though he came early to Venice, and lived there most\r\nof his life, never loses something of their wild freshness, and to the\r\nend delights in bringing them into his backgrounds. He lived with his\r\nmother at Conegliano, the beautiful town of the Trevisan marches, until\r\n1484, when he was twenty-five, and then came down to Vicenza, where he\r\nfell under the tuition of Bartolommeo Montagna, a Vicentine painter, who\r\nhad been studying both with Alvise and Bellini. Cima's \"Madonna with\r\nSaints,\" painted for the Church of St. Bartolommeo, Vicenza, in 1489,\r\nshows him still using the old method of tempera, in a careful, cold,\r\npainstaking style, yet already showing his own taste. The composition\r\nhas something of Alvise, yet that something has been learned through\r\nthe agency of Montagna, for the figures have the latter's severity\r\nand austere character and the colour is clearer and more crude than\r\nAlvise's. It is no light resemblance, and he must have been long with\r\nMontagna. In the type of the Christ in Montagna's Pietà at Monte Berico,\r\nin the fondness for airy porticoes, in the architecture and main\r\nfeatures of his \"Madonna enthroned\" in the Museo Civico at Vicenza, we\r\nsee characteristics which Cima followed, though he interpreted them in\r\nhis own way. He turns the heavy arches and domes that Alvise loved, into\r\nairy pergolas, decked with vines. He gives increasing importance to high\r\nskies and to atmospheric distances. When he got to Venice in 1492, he\r\nbegan to paint in oils, and undertook the panel of S. John Baptist with\r\nattendant saints, still in the Church of S. Madonna dell' Orto. The\r\nwork of this is rather angular and tentative, but true and fresh, and\r\nhe comes to his best soon after, in the \"Baptism\" in S. Giovanni in\r\nBragora, which Bellini, sixteen years later, paid him the compliment\r\nof copying. It was quite unusual to choose such a subject for the High\r\nAltar, and could only be justified by devotion to the Baptist, who was\r\nCima's own name-saint as well as that of the Church. Cima is here at his\r\nvery highest; the composition is not derived from any one else, but is\r\nall the conception of an ingenuous soul, full of intuition and insight.\r\nThe Christ is particularly fine and simple, unexaggerated in pose and\r\ntype; the arm of the Baptist is too long, but the very fault serves to\r\ngive him a refined, tentative look, which makes a sympathetic appeal.\r\nThe attendant angels look on with an air of sweet interest. The distant\r\nmountains, the undulating country, the little town of Conegliano,\r\nidentified by the castle on its great rock, or _Cima_, are Arcadian in\r\ntheir sunny beauty. The clouds, as a critic has pointed out, are full of\r\nsun, not of rain. The landscape has not the sombre mystery of Titian's,\r\nbut is bright with the joyous delight of a lover of outdoor life. As\r\nCima masters the new medium he becomes larger and simpler, and his forms\r\nlose much of their early angularity. A confraternity of his native town\r\nordered the grand altarpiece which is still in the Cathedral there, and\r\nin this he shows his connection with Venice; the architecture is partly\r\ntaken from St. Mark's, the lovely Madonna head recalls Bellini, and a\r\ngroup of Bellinesque angels play instruments at the foot of the throne.\r\nCima is, however, never merged in Bellini. He keeps his own clearly\r\ndefined, angular type; his peculiar, twisted curls are not the curls of\r\nBellini's saints, his treatment of surface is refined, enamel-like,\r\nperfectly finished, but it has nothing of the rich, broken treatment\r\nwhich Bellini's natural feeling for colour was beginning to dictate.\r\nCima's pale golden figures have an almost metallic sharpness and\r\nprecision, and though they are full of charm and refinement, they may\r\nbe thought lacking in spontaneity and passion. To 1501 belongs the\r\n\"Incredulity of St. Thomas,\" now in the Academy, but painted for the\r\nGuild of Masons. It is a picture full of expression and dignity, broad\r\nin treatment if a little cold in its self-restraint. Cima seems to have\r\nnot quite enough intellect, and not quite enough strong feeling.\r\nHowever, the little altarpiece of the Nativity, in the Church of the\r\nCarmine in Venice, has a richer, fuller touch, and this foreshadows the\r\nwork he did when he went to Parma, where his transparent shadows grow\r\nbroader and stronger, and his figures gain in ease and freedom. He\r\nnever loses the delicate radiance of his lights, and his types and his\r\narchitecture alike convey something of a peculiarly refined, brilliant\r\nelegance.\r\n\r\nLike all these men of great energy and prolific genius, Cima produced an\r\nastonishing number of panels and altarpieces, and no doubt had pupils on\r\nhis own account, for a goodly list could be made of pictures in his\r\nstyle, but not by his own hand, which have been carried by collectors\r\ninto widely-scattered places. His exquisite surface and finish and his\r\nmarked originality make him a difficult master to imitate with any\r\nsuccess. His latest work is dated 1508, but Ridolfi says he lived till\r\n1517, and it seems probable that he returned to his beloved Conegliano\r\nand there passed his last years.\r\n\r\nIf Cima possessed originality, Vincenzo of Treviso, called Catena,\r\ngained an immense reputation by his industry and his power of imitating\r\nand adopting the manner of Bellini's School. In those days men did not\r\ntrouble themselves much as to whether they were original or not. They\r\nworked away on traditional compositions, frankly introducing figures\r\nfrom their master's cartoons, modifying a type here, making some little\r\nexperiment or arrangement there, and, as a French critic puts it,\r\nleaving their own personality to \"hatch out\" in due time, if it existed,\r\nand when it was sufficiently ripened by real mastery of their art. It is\r\nhere that Catena fails; beginning as a journeyman in the Sala del Gran\r\nConsiglio, at a salary of three ducats a month, he for long failed to\r\nacquire the absolute mastery of drawing which was possessed by the\r\nbetter disciples of the schools. But he is painstaking, determined to\r\nget on, and eager to satisfy the continually increasing demand for work.\r\nHis draperies are confused and unmeaning, his faces round, with small\r\nfeatures, inexpressive button mouths, and weak chins, and his flesh\r\ntints have little of the glow which is later the prerogative of every\r\nsecond-rate painter. Yet Catena succeeds, like many another careful\r\nmediocre man, in securing patronage, and as the sixteenth century opened\r\nhe gained the distinction from Doge Loredano of a commission to paint\r\nthe altarpiece for the Pregadi Chapel of the Sala di Tre, in the Ducal\r\nPalace. He adapts his group from that of Bellini in the Cathedral of\r\nMurano, bringing in a profile portrait of the kneeling Doge, of which he\r\nafterwards made numerous copies, one of which was for long assigned to\r\nGentile and one to Giovanni Bellini.\r\n\r\nThat Catena is not without charm, we discern in such a composition as\r\nhis \"Martyrdom of St. Cristina,\" in S. Maria Mater Domini, in which the\r\nsaint, a solid, Bellinesque figure, kneels upon the water, in which she\r\nmet her death, and is surrounded by little angels, holding up the\r\nmillstone tied round her neck, and laden with other instruments of her\r\nmartyrdom. Catena borrows right and left, and tries to follow every new\r\nindication of contemporary taste. For instance, he remarks the growing\r\nadmiration for colour, and hopes by painting gay, flat tints, in bright\r\ncontrast, to produce the desired effect.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that he made many friends among the rich connoisseurs of\r\nthe time, and that his importance was out of proportion to his real\r\nmerit. Marcantonio Michele, writing an account of Raphael's last days to\r\na friend in Venice, and touching on Michelangelo's illness, begs him to\r\nsee that Catena takes care of himself, \"as the times are unfavourable to\r\ngreat painters.\" Catena had acquired and inherited considerable wealth;\r\nhe came of a family of merchants, and resided in his own house in San\r\nBartolommeo del Rialto. He lived in unmarried relations with Dona Maria\r\nFustana, the daughter of a furrier, to whom he bequeaths in his will 300\r\nducats and all his personal effects. As a careful portrait-painter, with\r\na talent for catching a likeness, he was in constant demand, and in some\r\nof his heads--that of a canon dressed in blue and red, at Vienna, and\r\nespecially in one of a member of the Fugger family, now at Dresden--he\r\nattains real distinction. And in his last phase he does at length prove\r\nthe power that lies behind long industry and perseverance. Suddenly the\r\nGiorgionesque influence strikes him, and turning to imbibe this new\r\nelement, he produces that masterpiece which throws a glamour over all\r\nhis mediocre performances; his \"Warrior adoring the Infant Christ,\" in\r\nthe National Gallery, is a picture full of charm, rich and romantic in\r\ntone and spirit. The Virgin and the Child upon her knee are of his\r\ndull round-eyed type, the form and colours of her draperies are still\r\nunsatisfactory, but the knight in armour with his Eastern turban, the\r\nromantic young page, holding his horse, are pure Giorgionesque figures.\r\nBeautiful in themselves, set in a beautiful landscape glowing with light\r\nand air, the whole picture exemplifies what surprising excellence could\r\nbe suddenly attained by even very inferior artists, who were constantly\r\nassociating with greater men, at a moment when the whole air was, as it\r\nwere, vibrating with genius.\r\n\r\nCatena was very much addicted to making his will, and at least five\r\ntestaments or codicils exist, one of them devising a sum of money for\r\nthe benefit of the School of Painters in Venice, and another leaving to\r\nhis executor, Prior Ignatius, the picture of a \"St. Jerome in his Cell,\"\r\nwhich may be the one in our national collection, which remained in\r\nVenice till 1862. It is painted in his gay tones, imitating Basaiti and\r\nLotto, and brings in the partridge of which he made a sort of sign\r\nmanual.\r\n\r\nCardinal Bembo writes in 1525 to Pietro Lippomano, to announce that, at\r\nhis request, he is continuing his patronage of Catena:\r\n\r\n     Though I had done all that lay in my power for Vincenzo Catena\r\n     before I received your Lordship's warm recommendation in his\r\n     favour, I did not hesitate, on receipt of your letter, to add\r\n     something to the first piece I had from him, and I did so\r\n     because of my love and reverence for you, and I trust that he\r\n     will return appropriate thanks to you for having remembered\r\n     that you could command me.\r\n\r\nMarco Basaiti was alternately a journeyman in different workshops and a\r\nmaster on his own account. For long the assistant and follower of Alvise\r\nVivarini, we may judge that he was also his most trusted confidant, for\r\nto him was left the task of completing the splendid altarpiece to S.\r\nAmbrogio, in the Frari. His heavy hand is apparent in the execution, and\r\nthe two saints, Sebastian and Jerome, in the foreground, have probably\r\nbeen added by him, for they have the air of interlopers, and do not come\r\nup to the rest of the company in form and conception. The Sebastian,\r\nwith his hands behind his back and his loin cloth smartly tied, is quite\r\nsufficiently reminiscent of Bellini's figure of 1473 to make us believe\r\nthat Basaiti was at once transferring his allegiance to that reigning\r\nmaster. In his earlier phase he has the round heads and the dry precise\r\nmanner of the Muranese. In his large picture in the Academy, the\r\n\"Calling of the Sons of Zebedee,\" he produces a large, important set\r\npiece, cold and lifeless, without one figure which arrests us, or\r\nlingers in the memory. \"The Christ on the Mount\" is more interesting as\r\nhaving been painted for San Giobbe, where Bellini's great altarpiece\r\nwas already hanging, and coming into competition with Bellini's early\r\nrendering of the same scene. Painted some thirty years later, it is\r\ninteresting to see what it has gained in \"modernness.\" The landscape and\r\ntrees are well drawn and in good colour, and the saints, standing on\r\neither side of a high portico, have dignity. In the \"Dead Christ,\" in\r\nthe Academy, he is following Bellini very closely in the flesh-tints and\r\nthe _putti_. The _putti_, looking thoughtfully at the dead, is a _motif_\r\nbeloved of Bellini, but Basaiti cannot give them Bellini's pathos and\r\nsignificance; they are merely childish and seem to be amused.\r\n\r\nIn 1515 Basaiti has entered upon a new phase. He has felt Giorgione's\r\ninfluence, and is beginning to try what he can do, while still keeping\r\nclose to Bellini, to develop a fuller touch, more animated figures, and\r\na brilliant effect of landscape. He runs a film of vaporous colour over\r\nhis hard outlines and makes his figures bright and misty, and though\r\nunderneath they are still empty and monotonous, it is not surprising\r\nthat many of his works for a time passed as those of Bellini. Though he\r\nis a clever imitator, \"his figures are designed with less mastery, his\r\ndrawing is a little less correct, his drapery less adapted to the under\r\nform. Light and shade are not so cleverly balanced, colours have the\r\nbrightness, but not the true contrast required. In landscape he proceeds\r\nfrom a bleak aridity to extreme gaiety; he does not dwell on detail, but\r\nhis masses have neither the sober tint nor the mysterious richness\r\nconspicuous in his teacher ... he is a clever instrument.\" Both\r\nPrevitali and Rondinelli were workers with Basaiti in Bellini's studio.\r\nPrevitali occasionally signed himself Andrea Cordeliaghi or Cordella,\r\nand has left many unsigned pictures. He copies Catena and Lotto, Palma\r\nand Montagna; but for a time his work went forth from Bellini's workshop\r\nsigned with Bellini's name. In 1515, in a great altarpiece in San\r\nSpirito at Bergamo, he first takes the title of Previtali, compiling it\r\nin the cartello with the monogram already used as Cordeliaghi. There are\r\ntraces of many other minor artists at this period, all essaying the same\r\nmanner, copying one or other of the masters, taking hints from each\r\nother. The Venetian love of splendour was turning to the collection\r\nof works of art, and the work of second-class artists was evidently\r\nmuch in demand and obtained its meed of admiration. Bissolo was a\r\nfellow-labourer with Catena in the Hall of the Ducal Palace in 1492; he\r\nis soft and nerveless, but he copies Bellini, and has imbibed something\r\nof his tenderness of spirit.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from this list how difficult it is to unravel the tale\r\nof the false Bellinis. The master's own works speak for themselves\r\nwith no uncertain voice, but away from these it is very difficult to\r\npronounce as to whether he had given a design, or a few touches, or\r\nadvice, and still more difficult to decide whether these were bestowed\r\non Basaiti in his later manner, or on Previtali or Bissolo, or if the\r\nteaching was handed on by them in a still more diluted form to the\r\nlesser men who clustered round, much of whose work has survived and has\r\nbeen masquerading for centuries under more distinguished names. It is\r\nsometimes affirmed that the loss of originality in the endeavour to\r\npaint like greater men has been a symptom of decay in every school in\r\nthe past. It is interesting to notice, therefore, that in every great\r\nage of painting there has always been an undercurrent of imitation,\r\nwhich has helped to form a stream of tradition, and which, as far as\r\nwe can see, has done no harm to the stronger spirits of the time.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\r\n\r\n _Cima._\r\n\r\n Berlin.

The\r\nFlorentine gestures and attitudes are expressive, nervous, fervent, or,\r\nas in Michelangelo and Signorelli, alive with superhuman energy. But\r\nwhen looking at pictures of the Venetian School we unconsciously use\r\nquite another sort of language; epithets like \"dark\" and \"rich\" come\r\nmost freely to our lips; a golden glow, a slumberous velvety depth,\r\nseem to engulf and absorb all details. We are carried into the land\r\nof romance, and are fascinated and soothed, rather than stimulated\r\nand aroused. So it is with portraits; before the \"Mona Lisa\" our\r\nintelligence is all awake, but the men and women of Venetian canvases\r\nhave a grave, indolent serenity, which accords well with the slumber\r\nof thought.\r\n\r\nUp to the beginning of the sixteenth century the painters of Venice\r\nhad not differed very materially from those of other schools; they\r\nhad gradually worked out or learned the technicalities of drawing,\r\nperspective and anatomy. They had been painting in oils for twenty-five\r\nyears, and they betrayed a greater fondness for pageant-pictures than\r\nwas felt in other States of Italy. Florence appoints Michelangelo and\r\nLeonardo to decorate her public palace, but no great store is set by\r\ntheir splendid achievements; their work is not even completed. The\r\nstudents fall upon the cartoons, which are allowed to perish, instead\r\nof being treasured by the nation. Gentile Bellini and Carpaccio and the\r\nband of State painters are appreciated and well rewarded. These men have\r\nreproduced something of the lucent transparency, the natural colour of\r\nVenice, but it is as if unconsciously; they are not fully aiming at any\r\nspecial effect. Year after year the Venetian masters assimilate more or\r\nless languidly the influences which reach them from the mainland. They\r\nwelcome Guariento and Gentile da Fabriano, they set themselves to learn\r\nfrom Veronese or Florentine, the Paduans contribute their chiselled\r\ndrawing, their learned perspective, their archeological curiosity. Yet\r\neven early in the day the Venetians escape from that hard and learned\r\nart which is so alien to their easy, voluptuous temperament. Jacopo\r\nBellini cannot conform to it, and his greatest son is ready to follow\r\nfeeling and emotion, and in his old age is quick to discover the first\r\nflavour of the new wine. If Venetian art had gone on upon the lines\r\nwe have been tracing up to now, there would have been nothing very\r\ndistinctive about it, for, however interesting and charming Alvise and\r\nCarpaccio, Cima and the Bellini may be, it is not of them we think when\r\nwe speak of the Venetian School and when we rank it beside that of\r\nFlorence, while Giovanni Bellini alone, in his later works, is not\r\nstrong enough to bear the burden.\r\n\r\nThe change which now comes over painting is not so much a technical one\r\nas a change of temper, a new tendency in human thought, and we link it\r\nwith Giorgione because he was the channel through which the deep impulse\r\nfirst burst into the light. We have tried to trace the growth of the\r\nearly Venetian School, but it does not develop logically like that of\r\nFlorence; it is not the result of long endeavour, adding one acquisition\r\nand discovery to another. Venetian art was peculiarly the outcome of\r\npersonalities, and it did not know its own mind till the sixteenth\r\ncentury. Then, like a hidden spring, it bubbles irresistibly to the\r\nsurface, and the spot where it does so is called by the name of a man.\r\n\r\nThere are beings in most great creative epochs who, with peculiar\r\nfacility, seem to embody the purpose of their age and to yield\r\nthemselves as ready instruments to its design. When time is ripe they\r\nappear, and are able, with perfect ease, to carry out and give voice to\r\nthe desires and tendencies which have been straining for expression.\r\nThese desires may owe their origin to national life and temperament; it\r\nmay have taken generations to bring them to fruition, but they become\r\naudible through the agency of an individual genius. A genius is\r\ninevitably moulded by his age. Rome, in the seventeenth century,\r\ndrew to her in Bernini a man who could with real power illustrate her\r\ndetermination to be grandiose and ostentatious, and, at the height of\r\nthe Renaissance, Venice draws into her service a man whose sensuous\r\nfeeling was instilled, accentuated, and welcomed by every element\r\naround him.\r\n\r\nMore conclusively than ever, at this time, Venice, the world's great\r\nsea-power, was in her full glory as the centre of the world's commerce\r\nand its art and culture. Vasco da Gama had discovered the sea route to\r\nIndia in 1498, but the stupendous effect which this was to exert on the\r\nwhole current of power did not become apparent all at once. Venice was\r\nstill the great emporium of the East, linked to it by a thousand ties,\r\nOriental in her love of Eastern richness.\r\n\r\nIt would be exaggerating to say that the Venetians of the sixteenth\r\ncentury could not draw. As there were Tuscans who understood beautiful\r\nharmonies of colour, so there were Venetians who knew a good deal about\r\nform; but the other Italians looked upon colour as a charming adjunct,\r\nalmost, one might say, as an amiable weakness: they never would have\r\nallowed that it might legitimately become the end and aim in painting,\r\nand in the same way form, though respected and considered, was never the\r\nprincipal object of the Venetians. Up to this time Venice had fed her\r\nemotional instincts by pageants and gold and velvets and brocades, but\r\nwith Giorgione she discovered that there was a deeper emotional vehicle\r\nthan these superficial glories,--glowing depths of colour enveloped in\r\nthe mysterious richness of chiaroscuro which obliterated form, and hid\r\nand suggested more than it revealed.\r\n\r\nGiorgione no longer described \"in drawing's learned tongue\"; he\r\ncarried all before him by giving his direct impression in colour. He\r\nconceives in colour. The Florentines cared little if their finely drawn\r\ndraperies were blue or red, but Giorgione images purple clouds, their\r\ndark velvet glowing towards a rose and orange horizon. He hardly knows\r\nwhat attitudes his characters take, but their chestnut hair, their\r\ndeep-hued draperies, their amber flesh, make a moving harmony in which\r\nthe importance of exact modelling is lost sight of. His scenes are not\r\ncomposed methodically and according to the old rules, but are the direct\r\nimpress of the painter's joy in life. It was a new and audacious style\r\nin painting, and its keynote, and absolutely inevitable consequence,\r\nwas to substitute for form and for gay, simple tints laid upon it, the\r\nquality of chiaroscuro. We all know how the shades of evening are able\r\nto transform the most commonplace scene; the dull road becomes a\r\nmysterious avenue, the colourless foliage develops luscious depths,\r\nthe drab and arid plain glows with mellow light, purple shadows clothe\r\nand soften every harsh and ugly object, all detail dies, and our\r\napprehension of it dies also. Our mood changes; instead of observing\r\nand criticising, we become soothed, contemplative, dreamy. It is the\r\ncarrying of this profound feeling into a colour-scheme by means of\r\nchiaroscuro, so that it is no longer learned and explanatory, but deeply\r\nsensuous and emotional, that is the gift to art which found full voice\r\nwith Giorgione, and which in one moment was recognised and welcomed to\r\nthe exclusion of the older manner, because it touched the chord which\r\nvibrated through the whole Venetian temperament.\r\n\r\nAnd the immediate result was the picture of _no subject_. Giorgione\r\ncreates for us idle figures with radiant flesh, or robed in rich\r\ncostumes, surrounded by lovely country, and we do not ask or care why\r\nthey are gathered together. We have all had dreams of Elysian fields,\r\n\"where falls not any rain, nor ever wind blows loudly,\" where all is\r\nrest and freedom, where music blends with the plash of fountains, and\r\nfruits ripen, and lovers dream away the days, and no one asks what went\r\nbefore or what follows after. The Golden Age, the haunt of fauns and\r\nnymphs: there never has been such a day, or such a land: it is a mood, a\r\nvision: it has danced before the eyes of poets, from David to Keats and\r\nTennyson: it has rocked the tired hearts of men in all ages: the vision\r\nof a resting-place which makes no demands and where the dwellers are\r\nexempt from the cares and weakness of mortality. Needless to say, it is\r\nan ideal born of the East; it is the Eastern dream of Paradise, and it\r\nspeaks to that strain in the temperament which recognises that life\r\ncannot be all thought, but also needs feeling and emotion. And for the\r\nfirst time in all the world the painter of Castelfranco sets that vague\r\ndream before men's eyes. The world, with its wistful yearnings and\r\nquestionings, such as Leonardo or Botticelli embodied, said little to\r\nhis audience. Here was their natural atmosphere, though they had never\r\nknown it before. These deep, solemn tones, these fused and golden lights\r\nare what Giorgione grasps from the material world, and as he steeps his\r\nsenses in them the subject counts but little in the deep enjoyment they\r\ncommunicate. We, who have seen his manner repeated and developed through\r\nthousands of pictures, find it difficult to realise that there had been\r\nnothing like it before, that it was a unique departure, that when\r\nBellini and Titian looked at his first creations they must have\r\nexperienced a shock of revelation. The old definite style must have\r\nseemed suddenly hard and meagre, and every time they looked on the\r\nglorious world, the deep glow of sunset, the mysterious shades of\r\nfalling night, they must have felt they were endowed with a sense to\r\nwhich they had hitherto been strangers, but which, it was at once\r\napparent, was their true heritage. They had found themselves, and in\r\nthem Venice found her real expression, and with Giorgione and those who\r\nfelt his impetus began the true Venetian School, set apart from all\r\nother forms of art by its way of using and diffusing and intensifying\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nWhen Giorgione, the son of a member of the house of Barbarelli and a\r\npeasant girl of Vedelago, came down to Venice, we gather that he had\r\nnothing of the provincial. Vasari, who must often have heard of him\r\nfrom Titian, describes him as handsome, engaging, of distinguished\r\nappearance, beloved by his friends, a favourite with women, fond of\r\ndress and amusement, an admirable musician, and a welcome guest in the\r\nhouses of the great. He was evidently no peasant-bred lad, but probably,\r\nthough there is no record of the fact, was brought up, like many\r\nillegitimate children, in the paternal mansion. His home was not far\r\nfrom the lagoons, in one of the most beautiful places it is possible to\r\nimagine, on a lovely and fertile plain running up to the Asolean hills\r\nand with the Julian Alps lying behind. We guess that he received his\r\neducation in the school of Bellini, for when that master sold his\r\nallegory of the \"Souls in Paradise\" to one of the Medici, to adorn the\r\nsummer villa of Poggio Imperiale, there went with it the two small\r\ncanvases now in the Uffizi, the \"Ordeal of Moses\" and the \"Judgment\r\nof Solomon,\" delightful little paintings in Giorgione's rich and\r\ndistinctive style, but less accomplished than Bellini's picture, and\r\nwith imperfections in the drawing of drapery and figures which suggest\r\nthat they are the work of a very young man. The love of the Venetians\r\nfor decorating the exterior of their palaces with fresco led to\r\nGiorgione being largely employed on work which was unhappily a grievous\r\nwaste of time and talent, as far as posterity is concerned. We have a\r\nrecord of façades covered with spirited compositions and heraldic\r\ndevices, of friezes with Bacchus and Mars, Venus and Mercury. Zanetti,\r\nin his seventeenth-century prints, has preserved a noble figure of\r\n\"Fortitude\" grasping an axe, but beyond a few fragments nothing has\r\nsurvived. Before he was thirty Giorgione was entrusted with the\r\nimportant commission of decorating the Fondaco dei Tedeschi. This\r\nbuilding, which we hear of so often in connection with the artists\r\nof Venice, was the trading-house for German, Hungarian, and Polish\r\nmerchants. The Venetian Government surrounded these merchants with the\r\nmost jealous restrictions. Every assistant and servant connected with\r\nthem was by law a Venetian, and, in fact, a spy of the Republic. All\r\ntransactions of buying and selling were carried out by Venetian brokers,\r\nof whom some thirty were appointed. As time went on, some of these\r\nbrokerships must have resolved themselves into sinecure offices, for\r\nwe find Bellini holding one, and certainly without discharging any of\r\nthe original duties, and they seem to have become some sort of State\r\nretainerships. In 1505 the old Fondaco had been burnt to the ground, and\r\nthe present building was rising when Giorgione and Titian were boys. A\r\ndecree went forth that no marble, carving, or gilding were to be used,\r\nso that painting the outside was the only alternative. The roof was on\r\nin 1507, and from that date Giorgione, Titian, and Morto da Feltre were\r\nemployed in the adornment of the façade. Vasari is very much exercised\r\nover Giorgione's share in these decorations. \"One does not find one\r\nsubject carefully arranged,\" he complains, \"or which follows correctly\r\nthe history or actions of ancients or moderns. As for me, I have never\r\nbeen able to understand the meaning of these compositions, or have met\r\nany one able to explain them to me. Here one sees a man with a lion's\r\nhead, beside a woman. Close by one comes upon an angel or a Love: it is\r\nall an inexplicable medley.\" Yet he is delighted with the brilliancy of\r\nthe colour and the splendid execution, and adds, \"Colour gives more\r\npleasure in Venice than anywhere else.\"\r\n\r\nAmong other early work was the little \"Adoration of the Magi,\" in the\r\nNational Gallery, and the so-called \"Philosophers\" at Vienna. According\r\nto the latest reading, this last illustrates Virgil's legend that when\r\nthe Trojan Æneas arrived in Italy, Evander pointed out the future site\r\nof Rome to the ancient seer and his son. Giorgione, in painting the\r\nscene, is absorbed in the beauty of nature. It is his first great\r\nlandscape, and all accessories have been sacrificed to intensity of\r\neffect. He revels in the glory of the setting sun, the broad tranquil\r\nmasses of foliage, the long evening shadows, and the effect of dark\r\nforms silhouetted against the radiant light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nGIORGIONE (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Giorgione was twenty-six he went back to Castelfranco, and painted\r\nan altarpiece for the Church of San Liberale. In the sixteenth century\r\nTuzio Costanza, a well-known captain of Free Companions, who had made\r\nhis fortune in the wars, where he had been attached to Catherine\r\nCornaro, followed the dethroned queen from Cyprus, and when she retired\r\nto Asolo, settled near her at Castelfranco. His son, Matteo, entered the\r\nservice of the Venetian Republic, and became a leader of fifty lances;\r\nbut Matteo was killed at the battle of Ravenna in 1504, and Costanza had\r\nhis son's body embalmed and buried in the family chapel.\r\n\r\nNothing is known of the details of this commission, but we are not\r\nstraining the bounds of probability by assuming that in a little town\r\nlike Castelfranco, hardly more than a village, the two youths must\r\nhave been well known to each other, and that this acquaintance and\r\nthe familiarity of the one with the appearance of the other may have\r\nbeen the determining cause which led the bereaved father to give the\r\ncommission to the young painter, while the tragic circumstances were\r\nsuch as would appeal to an ardent, enthusiastic nature. A treasure of\r\nour National Gallery is a study made by Giorgione for the figure of San\r\nLiberale, who is represented as a young man with bare head and crisp,\r\ngolden locks, dressed in silver armour, copied from the suit in which\r\nMatteo Costanza is dressed in the stone effigy which is still preserved\r\nin the cemetery at Castelfranco. At the side of the stone figure lies a\r\nhelmet, resembling that on the head of the saint in the altarpiece.\r\n\r\nIn Giorgione's group the Mother and Child are enthroned on high, with\r\nSt. Francis and St. Liberale on either hand. The Child's glance is\r\nturned upon the soldier-saint, a gallant figure with his lance at rest,\r\nhis dagger on his hip, his gloves in his hand, young, high-bred, with\r\nfeatures of almost feminine beauty. The picture is conceived in a new\r\nspirit of simplicity of design, and shows a new feeling for restraint in\r\nmatters of detail. It is the work of a man who has observed that early\r\nmorning, like late evening, has a marvellous power of eliminating all\r\nunessential accessories and of enveloping every object in a delicious\r\nscheme of light. Repainted, cleaned, restored as the canvas is, it is\r\nstill full of an atmosphere of calm serenity. It is not the ecstatic,\r\ndevotional reverie of Perugino's saints. The painter of Castelfranco\r\nhas not steeped his whole soul in religious imagination, like the\r\npainter of Umbria; he is an exemplar of the lyric feeling; his work is a\r\npoem in praise of youth and beauty, and dreams in air and sunshine. He\r\nuses atmosphere to enhance the mood, but Giorgione carries his unison of\r\nlandscape with human feeling much further than Perugino; he observes the\r\ndelicate effects of light, and limpid air circulates in his distance.\r\nThe sun rising over the sea throws a glamour and purity of early morning\r\nover a scene meant to glorify the memory of a young life. The painter\r\nshows his connection with his master by using the figure of the St.\r\nFrancis in Bellini's San Giobbe altarpiece. What Bellini owed to\r\nGiorgione is still a matter for speculation. The San Zaccaria\r\naltarpiece was, as we have seen, painted in the year following that of\r\nCastelfranco. Something has incited the old painter to fresh efforts;\r\nout of his own evolution, or stimulated by his pupil's splendid\r\nexperiments, he is drawn into the golden atmosphere of the Venetian\r\ncinque-cento.\r\n\r\nThe Venetian painters were distinguished by their love for the kindred\r\nart of music. Giorgione himself was an admirable musician, and linked\r\nwith all that is akin to music in his work, is his love for painting\r\ngroups of people knit together by this bond. He uses it as a pastime to\r\nbring them into company, and the rich chords of colour seem permeated\r\nwith the chords of sound. Not always, however, does he need even this\r\nexcuse; his \"conversation-pieces\" are often merely composed of persons\r\nplaced with indescribable grace in exquisite surroundings, governed by a\r\nmood which communicates itself to the beholder.\r\n\r\nWith the Florentines, the cartoon was carefully drawn upon the wall and\r\nflat tints were superimposed. They knew beforehand what the effect was\r\nto be; but the Venetians from this time gradually worked up the picture,\r\nimbedding tints, intensifying effects, one touch suggesting another,\r\ntill the whole rich harmony was gradually evoked. With the Florentines,\r\ntoo, the figures supply the main interest; the background is an\r\narbitrary addition, placed behind them at the painter's leisure, but\r\nGiorgione's and Titian's _fêtes champêtres_ and concerts could not _be_\r\nat all in any other environment. The amber flesh-tints and the glowing\r\ngarments are so blended with the deep tones of the landscape, that one\r\nwould not instil the mood the artist desires without the other. Piero di\r\nCosimo and Pintoricchio can place delightful nymphs and fairy princesses\r\nin idyllic scenes, and they stir no emotion in us beyond an observant\r\npleasure, a detached amusement; but Giorgione's gloomy blues, his\r\nfigures shining through the warm dusk of a summer evening, waken we\r\nhardly know what of vague yearning and brooding memory.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Fête Champêtre\" of the Louvre he acquires a frankly sensuous\r\ncharm. He becomes riper, richer in feeling, and displays great\r\nexuberance of style. The woman filling her pitcher at the fountain is\r\nexquisite in line and curve and amber colour. She seems to listen lazily\r\nto the liquid fall of the water mingling with the half-heard music of\r\nthe pipes. The beautiful idyll in the Giovanelli Palace is full of art\r\nof composition. It is built up with uprights; pillars are formed by the\r\ngroups of trees and figures, cut boldly across by the horizontal line of\r\nthe bridge, but the figures themselves are put in without any attention\r\nto subject, though an unconscious humorist has discovered in them the\r\ndomestic circle of the painter. The man in Venetian dress is there to\r\nassist the left-hand columnar group, placed at the edge of the picture\r\nafter the manner of Leonardo. The woman and child lighten the mass of\r\nfoliage on the right and make a beautiful pattern. The white town of\r\nCastelfranco sings against the threatening sky, the winds bluster\r\nthrough the space, the trees shiver with the coming storm. Here and\r\nthere leafy boughs are struck in with a slight, crisp touch, in which\r\nwe can follow readily the painter's quick impression.\r\n\r\nThe \"Knight of Malta\" is a grand magisterial figure, majestic, yet full\r\nof ardent warmth lying behind the grave, indifferent nobility. The face\r\nis bisected with shadow, in the way which Michelangelo and Andrea del\r\nSarto affected, and the cone-shaped head with parted hair is of the type\r\nwhich seems particularly to have pleased the painter. To Giorgione, too,\r\nbelongs the honour of having created a Venus as pure as the Aphrodite of\r\nCnidos and as beautiful as a courtesan of Titian.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Giorgione._\r\n                 FÊTE CHAMPÊTRE.\r\n                _Louvre._\r\n                 (_Photo, Alinari._)]\r\n\r\nThe death of Giorgione from plague in 1511 is registered by all the\r\noldest authorities. His body was conveyed to Castelfranco by members of\r\nthe Barbarelli family and buried in the Church of San Liberale. In 1638\r\nan epitaph was placed over his tomb by Matteo and Ercole Barbarelli.\r\n\r\nAllowing that he was hardly more than twenty when his new manner began\r\nto gain a following, he had only some twelve years in which to establish\r\nhis deep and lasting influence. We divine that he was a man of strong\r\npersonality, such a one as warms and stimulates his companions. Even his\r\nnickname tells us something,--Great George, the Chief, the George of\r\nGeorges,--it seems to express him as a leader. And we have no lack of\r\nproof that he was admired and looked up to. His style became the only\r\none that found favour in Venice, and the painters of the day did their\r\nbest to conform to it. Few authentic examples are left from his own\r\nhand, but out of his conscious and devoted and more or less successful\r\nimitators, there grew up a school, \"out of all those fascinating works,\r\nrightly or wrongly attributed to him; out of many copies from, or\r\nvariations on him, by unknown or uncertain workmen, whose drawings and\r\ndesigns were, for various reasons, prized as his; out of the immediate\r\nimpression he made upon his contemporaries and with which he continued\r\nin men's minds; out of many traditions of subject and treatment which\r\nreally descend from him to our own time, and by retracing which we fill\r\nout the original image.\"\r\n\r\nSumming up all these influences, he has left us the Giorgionesque;\r\nthe art of choosing a moment in which the subject and the elements of\r\ncolour and design are so perfectly fused and blended that we have no\r\nneed to ask for any more articulate story; a moment into which all the\r\nsignificance, the fulness of existence has condensed itself, so that\r\nwe are conscious of the very essence of life. Those idylls of beings\r\nwrapped into an ideal dreamland by music and the sound of water and the\r\nbeauty of wood and mountain and velvet sward, need all our conscious\r\napprehension of life if we are to drink in their full fascination. The\r\ndream of the Lotos-eaters can only come with force to those who can\r\ncontrast it adequately with the experience, the complication, and the\r\nthousand distractions of an over-civilised world. Rest and relaxation,\r\nthe power of the deeply tinted eventide, or of the fresh morning light,\r\nand the calm that drinks in the sensations they are able to afford, are\r\namong the precious things of life. The instinct upon which Giorgione's\r\nwork rests is the satisfying of the feeling as well as the thinking\r\nfaculty, the life of the heart, as compared to the life of the\r\nintellect, the solution of life's problems by love instead of by\r\nthought. It was the Eastern ideal, and its positive expression is\r\nconveyed by means of colour, deep, restful, satisfying, fused and\r\ncontrolled by chiaroscuro rather than by form.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\r\n\r\n Berlin.

The Venetian painters that is, for it is remarkable, at a time\r\nwhen the men of one city observed and studied and took hints from those\r\nof every other, how faint are the signs that this particular manner\r\nattracted any great attention in other art centres. Leonardo da Vinci\r\nwas a master of chiaroscuro, but he used it only to express his forms,\r\nand never sacrifices to it the delicacy and fineness of his design. It\r\nis the one quality Raphael never assimilates, except for a brief instant\r\nat the period when Sebastian del Piombo had arrived in Rome from\r\nVenice. It takes hold most strongly upon Andrea del Sarto, who seems,\r\nsignificantly enough, to have had no very pronounced intellectual\r\ncapacity, but in Venice itself it now became the only way. The old\r\nBellini finds in it his last and fullest ideal; Catena, Basaiti, Cariani\r\ndo their best to acquire it, and so successfully was it acquired, so\r\ncongenial was it to Venetian art, that even second- and third-rate\r\nVenetian painters have usually something attractive which triumphs over\r\nsuperficial and doubtful drawing and grouping. It is easy to see how\r\nmuch to their taste was this fused and golden manner, this disregard of\r\ndefined form, and this new play of chiaroscuro. The Venetian room in the\r\nNational Gallery is full of such examples: the Nymphs and _Amoretti_ of\r\nNo. 1695, charming figures against melting vines and olives; \"Venus and\r\nAdonis,\" in which a bewitching Cupid chases a butterfly; Lovers in a\r\nlandscape, roaming in the summer twilight; scenes in which neither\r\nperson nor scenery is a pretext for the other, but each has its full\r\nshare in arousing the desired emotion. Such pictures are ascribed to, or\r\ntaken from Giorgione by succeeding critics, but have all laid hold of\r\nhis charm, and have some share in his inspiration.\r\n\r\nOne of the ablest of his followers, a man whose work is still confounded\r\nwith the master's, is Cariani, the Bergamasque, who at different times\r\nin his life also successfully imitated Palma and Lotto. In his\r\nGiorgionesque manner Cariani often creates charming figures and strong\r\nportraits, though he pushes his colour to a coarse, excessive tone. His\r\nfamily group in the Roncalli Collection at Bergamo is very close to\r\nGiorgione. Seven persons, three women and four men, are grouped together\r\nupon a terrace, and behind them stretches a calm landscape, half\r\nconcealed by a brocaded hanging. The effect of the whole is restful,\r\nthough it lacks Giorgione's concentration of sensation. Then, again,\r\nCariani flies off to the gayer, more animated style of Lotto. Later on,\r\nwhen he tries to reproduce Giorgione's pastoral reveries, his shepherds\r\nand nymphs become mere peasants, herdsmen, and country wenches, who have\r\nnothing of the idyllic distinction which Giorgione never failed to\r\ninfuse. \"The Adulteress before Christ\" at Glasgow still bears the\r\ngreater name, but its short, vulgar figures and faulty composition\r\ndisclaim his authorship, while Cariani is fully capable of such\r\nfailings, and the exaggerated, red-brown tone is quite characteristic\r\nof him.\r\n\r\nThese painters are more than merely imitative; they are also typical.\r\nGiorgione's new manner had appealed to some quality inherent and\r\nhereditary in their nature, and the essential traits they single out and\r\ndwell upon are the traits which appeal equally to the instincts of both.\r\nIt is this which makes their efforts more sympathetic than those of\r\nother second-rate painters. Colour, or rather the peculiar way in which\r\nGiorgione used colour, made a natural appeal to them, and it is a medium\r\nwhich does make an immediate appeal and covers a multitude of\r\nshortcomings.\r\n\r\nBut Giorgione was not to leave his message to the mercy of mere\r\ndisciples and imitators, however apt. Growing up around him were men to\r\nwhom that message was an inspiration and a trumpet-call, men who were to\r\ndevelop and deepen it, endowing it with their own strength, recognising\r\nthat the way which the young pioneer of Castelfranco had pointed out\r\nwas the one into which they could unhesitatingly pour their whole\r\ninclination. The instinct for colour was in their very blood. They\r\nturned to it with the heart-whole delight with which a bird seeks the\r\nair or a fish the water, and foremost among them, to create and to\r\nconsolidate, was the mighty Titian.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\r\n\r\n _Cariani._\r\n\r\n Bergamo.

Cadore is a\r\nland of rich chestnut woods, of leaping streams, of gleams and glooms,\r\nsudden storms and bursts of sunshine. It is an order of scenery which\r\nenters deep into the affections of its sons, and we can form some idea\r\nof the hold its mingling of wild poetry and sensuous softness obtained\r\nover the mind of Titian from the fact that in after years, while he\r\nnever exerts himself to paint the city in which he lived and in which\r\nall his greatest triumphs were gained, he is uniformly constant to his\r\nmountain home, enters into its spirit and interprets its charm with warm\r\nand penetrating insight.\r\n\r\nThe district formed part of the dependencies of the great republic, and\r\nrelied upon Venice for its safety, its distinction, and in great measure\r\nfor its employment. The small craftsmen and artists from all the country\r\nround looked forward to going down to seek their fortune at her hands.\r\nThey tacked the name of their native town to their own name, and were\r\ndrawn into the magnificent life of the city of the sea, and came back\r\nfrom time to time with stories of her art, her power, and beauty.\r\n\r\nThe Vecelli had for generations held honourable posts in Cadore. The\r\nfather and grandfather of the young Tiziano were influential men, and\r\nwith his brother and sisters he must have been brought up in comfort.\r\nThere are even traditions of noble birth, and it is evident that Titian\r\nwas always a gentleman, though this did not prevent his being educated\r\nas a craftsman, and when he was only ten years old he was sent down to\r\nVenice to be apprenticed to a mosaicist.\r\n\r\nIt was a changing Venice to which Titian came as a boy; changing in its\r\nlife, its social and political conditions, and its art was faithfully\r\nregistering its aspirations and tastes. More than at any previous time,\r\nit was calculated to impress a youth to whom it had been held up as the\r\nembodiment of splendid sovereignty, and the difference between the\r\nlittle hill-town set in the midst of its wild solitudes and the\r\nbrilliant city of the sea must have been dazzling and bewildering. A\r\nnew sense of intellectual luxury had awakened in the great commercial\r\ncentre. The Venetian love of splendour was displaying itself by the\r\nencouragement and collection of objects of art, and both ancient and\r\nmodern works were in increasing request. On Gentile Bellini's and\r\nCarpaccio's canvases we see the sort of people the Venetians were,\r\nshrewd, quiet, splendour-loving, but business-like, the young men\r\nfashionably dressed, fastidious connoisseurs, splendid patrons of art\r\nand of religion. Buyers were beginning to find out what a delightful\r\ndecoration the small picture made, and that it was as much in place in\r\ntheir own halls as over the altar of a chapel. The portrait, too, was\r\ngaining in importance, and the idea of making it a pleasure-giving\r\npicture, even more than a faithful transcript, was gathering ground. The\r\n\"Procession of the Relic\" was still in Gentile's studio, but the Frari\r\n\"Madonna and Child\" was just installed in its place. Carpaccio was\r\nbeginning his long series of St. Ursula, and the Bellini and Vivarini\r\nwere in keen rivalship.\r\n\r\nTitian is said to have passed from the _bottega_ of Gentile to that of\r\nGiovanni Bellini, but nothing in his style reminds us of the former, and\r\neven his early work has very little that is really Bellinesque, whereas\r\nfrom the very first he reflects the new spirit which emanated from\r\nGiorgione. Titian was a year the elder, and we can divine the sympathy\r\nthat arose between the two when they came together in Bellini's School.\r\nAs soon as their apprenticeship was at an end they became partners. Fond\r\nof pleasure and gaiety, loving splendour, dress, and amusement, they\r\nwere naturally congenial companions, and were drawn yet more closely\r\ntogether by their love for their art and by the aptitude with which\r\nTitian grasped Giorgione's principles.\r\n\r\nAnd if we ask ourselves why we take for granted that of two young men so\r\nclosely allied in age and circumstance we accept Giorgione as the leader\r\nand the creator of the new style, we may answer that Titian was a more\r\ncomplex character. He was intellectual, and carried his intellect into\r\nhis art, but this was no new feature. The intellect had had and was\r\nhaving a large share in art. But in that part which was new, and which\r\nwas launching art upon an untried course, Giorgione is more intense,\r\nmore one-idea'd than Titian. What he does he does with a fervour and a\r\nspontaneity that marks him as one who pours out the language of the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nThe partnership between the two was probably arranged a few years before\r\nthe end of the century, for we have seen that young painters usually\r\nstarted on their own account at about nineteen or twenty. For some years\r\nTitian, like Giorgione, was engrossed by the decorations of the Fondaco\r\ndei Tedeschi. The groups of figures described by Zanetti in 1771 show us\r\nthat while Giorgione made some attempt at following classic figures,\r\nTitian broke entirely with Greek art and only thought of picturesque\r\nnature and contemporary costume.\r\n\r\nVasari complains that he never knew what Titian's \"Judith\" was meant to\r\nrepresent, \"unless it was Germania,\" but Zanetti, who had the benefit of\r\nSebastiano Ricci's taste, declares that from what he saw, both Giorgione\r\nand Titian gave proofs of remarkable skill. \"While Giorgione showed a\r\nfervid and original spirit and opened up a new path, over which he shed\r\na light that was to guide posterity, Titian was of a grander and more\r\nequable genius, leaning at first, indeed, upon Giorgione's example, but\r\nexpanding with such force and rapidity as to place him in advance of\r\nhis companion, on an eminence to which no later craftsman was able to\r\nclimb.... He moderated the fire of Giorgione, whose strength lay in\r\nfanciful movement and a mysterious artifice in disposing shadows,\r\ncontrasted darkly with warm lights, blended, strengthened, blurred, so\r\nas to produce the semblance of exuberant life.\" Certain works remain to\r\nlink the two painters; even now critics are divided as to which of\r\nthe two to attribute the \"Concert\" in the Pitti. The figures are\r\nGiorgionesque, but the technique establishes it as an early Titian, and\r\nit is doubtful whether Giorgione would be capable of the intellectual\r\neffort which produced the dreamy, passionate expression of the young\r\nmonk, borne far out of himself by his own melody, and half recalled to\r\nlife by the touch on his shoulder. Titian, like Giorgione, was a\r\nmusician, and the fascination of music is felt by many masters of the\r\nItalian schools. In one picture the player feels vaguely after the\r\nmelody, in another we are asked to anticipate the song that is just\r\nabout to begin, or the last chords of that just finished vibrate upon\r\nthe ear, but nowhere else in all art has any one so seized the melody of\r\nan instant and kept its fulness and its passion sounding in our ears as\r\nthis musician does.\r\n\r\nThough we cannot say that Titian was the pupil of any one master, the\r\nfifteen years, more or less, that he spent with Giorgione left an\r\nindelible impression upon him. We have only to look at such a picture\r\nas the \"Madonna and Child with SS. John Baptist and Antony Abate,\"\r\nin the Uffizi, an early work, to recollect that in 1503 Giorgione at\r\nCastelfranco had taken the Madonna from her niche in the sanctuary\r\nand had enthroned her on high in a bright and sunny landscape with\r\nS. Liberale standing sentinel at her feet, like a knight guarding\r\nhis liege lady.\r\n\r\nTitian in this early group casts every convention aside; a beautiful\r\nwoman and lovely children are placed in surroundings whose charm is\r\ndevoid of hieratic and religious significance. The same easy unfettered\r\ntreatment appears in the \"Madonna with the Cherries\" at Vienna, and the\r\n\"Madonna with St. Bridget and S. Ulfus\" at Madrid, and while it has been\r\nsurmised that the example of the precise Albert Dürer, who paid his\r\nfirst visit to Venice in 1506, was not without its effect in preserving\r\nTitian from falling into laxity of treatment and in inciting him to fine\r\nfinish, it is interesting to find that Titian was, in fact, discarding\r\nthe use of the carefully traced and transferred cartoon, and was\r\nsketching his design freely on panel or canvas with a brush dipped in\r\nbrown pigment, and altering and modifying it as he went on.\r\n\r\nThe last years of Titian's first period in Venice must have been anxious\r\nones. The Emperor Maximilian was attacking the Venetian possessions on\r\nthe mainland, in anger at a refusal to grant his troops a free passage\r\non their way to uphold German supremacy in Central Italy. Cadore was\r\nthe first point of his invasion, and from 1507 Titian's uncle and\r\ngreat-uncle were in the Councils of the State, his father held an\r\nimportant command, and his brother Francesco, who had already made some\r\nprogress as an artist, threw down his brush and became a soldier. Titian\r\nwas not one of those who took up arms, but his thoughts must have been\r\nfull of the attack and defence in his mountain fastnesses, and he must\r\nhave anxiously awaited news of his father's troops and of the squadrons\r\nof Maso of Ferrara, under whose colours Francesco was riding. Francesco\r\nmade a reputation as a distinguished soldier, and was severely wounded,\r\nand when peace was made, Titian, \"who loved him tenderly,\" persuaded him\r\nto return to the pursuit of art.\r\n\r\nThe ratification of the League of Cambray, in which Julius II.,\r\nMaximilian, and Ferdinand of Naples combined against the power of\r\nVenice, was disastrous for a time to the city and to the artists who\r\ndepended upon her prosperity. Craftsmen of all kinds first fled to her\r\nfor shelter, then, as profits and orders fell off, they left to look\r\nelsewhere for commissions. An outbreak of plague, in which Giorgione\r\nperished, went further to make Venice an undesirable home, and at this\r\ntime Sebastian del Piombo left for Rome, Lotto for the Romagna, and\r\nTitian for Padua.\r\n\r\nWe may believe that Titian never felt perfectly satisfied with\r\nfresco-painting as a craft, for when he was given a commission to fresco\r\nthe halls of the Santo, the confraternity of St. Anthony, patron-saint\r\nof Padua, he threw off beautifully composed and spirited drawings, but\r\nhe left the execution of them chiefly to assistants, among whom the\r\nfeeble Domenico Campagnola, a painter whom he probably picked up at\r\nPadua, is conspicuous. Even where the landscape is best, as in \"S.\r\nAnthony restoring a Youth,\" the drawing and composition only make us\r\nfeel how enchanting the scene would have been in oils on one of Titian's\r\nmelting canvases. In those frescoes which he executed himself while his\r\ninterest was still fresh, the \"Miracle which grants Speech to an Infant\"\r\nis the most Giorgionesque. Up to this time he had preserved the\r\nstraight-cut corsage and the actual dress of his contemporaries, after\r\nthe practice of Giorgione; he keeps, too, to his companion's plan of\r\ndesign, placing the most important figures upon one plane, close to the\r\nframe and behind a low wall or ledge which forms a sort of inner frame\r\nand with a distant horizon. In the Paduan frescoes he makes use of this\r\nplan, and the straight clouds, the spindly trees, and the youths in gay\r\ndoublets are all reminiscent of his early comrade, but the group of\r\nwomen to the left in the \"Miracle of the Child\" shows that Titian is\r\nbeginning more decidedly to enunciate his own type. The introduction of\r\nportraits proves that he was tending to rely largely upon nature, in\r\ncontradistinction to Giorgione's lyrically improvised figures. He fuses\r\nthe influence of Giorgione and the influence of Antonello da Messina and\r\nthe Bellini in a deeper knowledge of life and nature, and he is passing\r\nbeyond Giorgione in grasp and completeness. When he was able to return\r\nto Venice, which he did in 1512, a temporary peace having been concluded\r\nwith Maximilian, he abandoned the uncongenial medium of fresco for good,\r\nand devoted himself to that which admitted of the afterthoughts, the\r\nenrichments, the gradual attainment of an exquisite surface, and at\r\nthis time his works are remarkable for their brilliant gloss and finish.\r\n\r\nDuring the next twelve years we may group a number of paintings which,\r\ntaken in conjunction with those of Giorgione, show the true Venetian\r\nSchool at its most intense, idyllic moment. They are the works of a man\r\nin the pride of youth and strength, sane and healthy, an example of the\r\nconfident, sanguine, joyous temper of his age, capable of embodying\r\nits dominant tendencies, of expressing its enjoyment of life, its\r\nworldly-mindedness, its love of pleasure, as well as its noble feeling\r\nand its grave and magnificent purpose.\r\n\r\nFor absolute delight in colour let us turn to a picture like the \"Noli\r\nme tangere\" of the National Gallery. The golden light, the blues and\r\nolives of the landscape, the crimson of the Magdalen's raiment, combine\r\nin a feast of emotional beauty, emphasising the feeling of the woman,\r\nwhose soul is breathed out in the word \"Master.\" The colour unites with\r\nthe light and shadow, is embedded in it; and we can see Titian's delight\r\nin the ductile medium which had such power to give material sensation.\r\nIn these liquid crimsons, these deep greens and shoaling blues, the\r\nvelvety fulness and plenitudes of the brush become visible; we can look\r\ninto their depths and see something quite unlike the smooth, opaque\r\nwashes of the Florentines.\r\n\r\nIn such a masterpiece as \"Sacred and Profane Love,\" painted during\r\nthese years for the Borghese, there are summed up all those artistic\r\naims towards which the Venetian painters had been tending. The picture\r\nis still Giorgionesque in mood. It may represent, as Dr. Wickhoff\r\nsuggests, Venus exhorting Medea to listen to the love-suit of Jason; but\r\nthe subject is not forced upon us, and we are more occupied with the\r\ncontrast between the two beautiful personalities, so harmoniously\r\nrelated to each other, yet so opposed in type. The gracious,\r\nself-absorbed lady, with her softly dressed hair, her loose glove, her\r\nsilvery satin dress, is a contrast in look and spirit to the goddess\r\nwhose free, simple attitude and outward gaze embody the nobler ideal.\r\nThe sinuous and enchanting line of Venus's figure against the crimson\r\ncloak has, I think, been the outcome of admiration for Giorgione's\r\n\"Sleeping Venus,\" and has the same soft, unhurried curves. Titian's two\r\nfigures are perfectly spaced in a setting which breathes the very aroma\r\nof the early Renaissance. A bas-relief on the marble fountain represents\r\nnymphs whipping a sleeping Love to life, while a cupid teases the chaste\r\nunicorn. A delicious baby Love splashes in the water, fallen rose-leaves\r\nstrew the mellow marble rim, around and away stretches a sunny country\r\nscene, in which people are placidly pursuing a life of ease and\r\npleasure. What a revelation to Venice these pictures were which began\r\nwith Giorgione's conversaziones! How little occupied the women are with\r\nthe story. Venus does not argue, or check off reasons on her fingers,\r\nlike S. Ursula. Medea is listening to her own thoughts, but the whole\r\nscene is bathed in the suggestion of the joy and happiness of love. The\r\nlittle censer burning away in the blue and breathless air might be a\r\nphiltre diffusing sensuous dreams, and when the rays of the evening sun\r\nstrike the picture, where it now hangs, and bring out each touch of its\r\nglowing radiance, it seems to palpitate with the joy of life and to\r\nthrill with the magic of summer in the days when the world was young.\r\n\r\nWith the influence still lingering of Giorgione's \"Knight of Malta,\"\r\nTitian produced some of his finest portraits in the decade that led to\r\nthe middle of his life. The \"Dr. Parma\" at Vienna, the noble \"Man in\r\nBlack\" and \"Man with a Glove\" of the Louvre, the \"Young Englishman\" of\r\nthe Pitti, with his keen blue eyes, the portrait at Temple Newsam,\r\nwhich, with some critics, still passes as a Giorgione, are all examples\r\nin which he keeps the half-length, invented by Bellini and followed by\r\nGiorgione.\r\n\r\nAfter the visit to Padua he shows less preference for costume, and his\r\nwomen are generally clothed in a loose white chemise, rather than the\r\nsquare-cut bodice.\r\n\r\nWe do not wonder that all the leading personages of Italy wished to be\r\npainted by Titian. His are the portraits of a man of intellect. They\r\nshow the subject at his best; grave, cultivated, stately, as he appeared\r\nand wished to appear; not taken off his guard in any way. What can be\r\nmore sympathetic as a personality than the Ariosto of the National\r\nGallery? We can enter into his mind and make a friend of him, and yet\r\nall the time he has himself in hand; he allows us to divine as much as\r\nhe chooses, and draws a thin veil over all that he does not intend us to\r\ndiscover. The painter himself is impersonal and not over-sensitive; he\r\ndoes not paint in his own fancies about his sitter--probably he had\r\nnone; he saw what he was meant to see. There was what Mr. Berenson calls\r\n\"a certain happy insensibility\" about him, which prevented him from\r\ntaking fantastic flights, or from looking too deep below the surface.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Titian._\r\n                 ARIOSTO.\r\n                _London._\r\n                 (_Photo, Mansell and Co._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTITIAN (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the \"Assumption,\" finished in 1518 for the Church of the Frari,\r\nTitian rose to the very highest among Renaissance painters. The\r\n\"Glorious S. Mary\" was his theme, and he concentrated all his efforts on\r\nthe realisation of that one idea. The central figure is, as it were, a\r\ncollective rather than an individual type. Well proportioned and elastic\r\nas it is, it has the abundance of motherhood. Harmonious and serene, it\r\ncombines dramatic force and profound feeling. Exultant Humanity, in its\r\nhour of triumph, rises with her, borne up lightly by that throbbing\r\ncompany of child angels and followed by full recognition and awestruck\r\nsatisfaction in the adoring gaze of the throng below, yet Titian has\r\ncontrived to keep some touch of the loving woman hurrying to meet her\r\nson. The flood of colour, the golden vault above, the garment of glowing\r\nblues and crimsons, have a more than common share in that spirit of\r\nconfident joy and poured-out life which envelops the whole canvas. In\r\nthe worthy representation of a great event, the visible assumption of\r\nHumanity to the Throne of God, Titian puts forth all his powers and\r\nsteeps us in that temper of sanguine emotion, of belief in life and\r\nconfidence in the capacity of man, which was so characteristic of the\r\nripe Renaissance. In looking at this splendid canvas, we must call to\r\nmind the position for which Titian painted it. Hung in the dusky\r\nrecesses of the apse, it was tempered by and merged in its stately\r\nsurroundings. The band of Apostles almost formed a part of the\r\nwhispering crowd below, and the glorious Mother was beheld soaring\r\nupwards to the golden light and the mysterious vistas of the vaulted\r\narches above.\r\n\r\nThe patronage of courts had by this time altered the tenor of Titian's\r\nlife. In 1516 Duke Alfonso d'Este had invited him to Ferrara, where he\r\nhad finished Bellini's \"Bacchanals.\" It bears the marks of Titian's\r\nhand, and he has introduced a well-known point of view at Cadore into\r\nthe background. In 1518 Alfonso writes to propose another painting, and\r\nTitian's acceptance is contained in a very courtier-like letter, in\r\nwhich we divine a touch of irony. \"The more I thought of it,\" he ends,\r\n\"the more I became convinced that the greatness of art among the\r\nancients was due to the assistance they received from great princes, who\r\nwere content to leave to the painter the credit and renown derived from\r\ntheir own ingenuity in bespeaking pictures.\" Alfonso's requirements for\r\nhis new castle were frankly pagan. Mythological scenes were already\r\npopular. Mantegna had adorned Isabela d'Este's \"Paradiso\" with revels\r\nof the gods, Botticelli had given his conception of classic myth in the\r\nMedici villa, already Bellini had essayed a Bacchanal, and Titian was to\r\nmake designs for similar scenes to complete the decorations of the halls\r\nof Este. The same exuberant feeling he shows in the \"Assumption\" finds\r\nutterance in the \"Garden of Loves\" and the \"Bacchanals,\" both painted\r\nfor Alfonso of Ferrara. The children in the former may be compared with\r\nthe angels in the \"Assumption.\" Their blue wings match the heavenly blue\r\nsky, and they are painted with the most delicate finish.\r\n\r\nWe can imagine the beauty of the great hall at Ferrara when hung with\r\nthis brilliant series, which was completed in 1523 by the \"Bacchus and\r\nAriadne\" of the National Gallery. The whole company of bacchanals is\r\ngiven up to wanton merrymaking. Above them broods the deep blue sky and\r\ngreat white clouds of a summer day. The deep greens of the foliage throw\r\nthe creamy-white and burning colour of the draperies and the fair forms\r\nof the nymphs into glowing relief, while by a convention the satyrs\r\nare of a deep, tawny complexion. On a roll of music is stamped the\r\nrollicking device, \"_Chi boit et ne reboit, ne sçeais que boir soit_.\"\r\nThe purple fruit hangs ripened from the vines, its crimson juice shines\r\nlike a jewel in crystal goblets and drips in streams over rosy limbs.\r\nThe influence of such pictures as these was absorbed by Rubens, but\r\nthough they hardly surpass him in colour, they are more idyllic and\r\nless coarse. The perfect taste of the Renaissance is never shown more\r\nvictoriously than here, where indulgence ceases to be repulsive, and the\r\nactors are real flesh and blood, yet more Arcadian than revolting. In\r\nthe \"Bacchus and Ariadne,\" Titian gives triumphant expression to a mood\r\nof wild rejoicing, so gay, so good-tempered, so simple, that we must\r\nsmile in sympathy. The conqueror flinging himself from his golden\r\nchariot drawn by panthers, his deep red mantle fluttering on high, is so\r\nfull of reckless life that our spirit bounds with him. His rioting band,\r\nmarching with song and laughter, seems to people that golden country-side\r\nwith fit inhabitants. The careless satyrs and little merry, goat-legged\r\nfauns shock us no more than a herd of forest ponies, tossing their manes\r\nand dashing along for love of life and movement.[3] Yet almost before\r\nthis series was put in place Titian was showing the diversity of his\r\ngenius by the \"Deposition,\" now in the Louvre, which was painted at the\r\ninstance of the Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua and nephew of Alfonso d'Este.\r\nHere he makes a great step in the use of chiaroscuro. While it is\r\nsatisfying in balance and sweeping rhythm, and by the way in which every\r\nline follows and intensifies the helpless, slackened lines of the dead\r\nBody, it escapes Raphael's academic treatment of the same subject. Its\r\nsplendid colours are not noisy; they merge into a scene of solemn pathos\r\nand tragedy. The scene has a simplicity and unity in its passion, and\r\nwhat above all gives it its intense power is the way in which the\r\nflaming hues are absorbed into the twilight shadows. The dark heads\r\nstand out against the dying sunset, the pallor of the dead is half\r\nveiled by the falling night. It is a picture which has the emotional\r\nbeauty of a scene in nature, and makes a profound impression by its\r\ndepth and mystery. This same solemnity and gravity temper the brilliant\r\ncolouring of the great altarpiece painted for the Pesaro family in the\r\nFrari. Columns rise like great tree-trunks, light and air play through\r\nthe clouds seen between them. The grouping is a new experiment, but the\r\nway in which the Mother and Child, though placed quite at one side of\r\nthe picture, are focussed as the centre of interest, by the converging\r\nlines, diagonal on the one hand and straight on the other, crowns it\r\nwith success. The scheme of colour brings the two figures into high\r\nrelief, while St. Francis and the family of the donor are subordinated\r\nto rich, deep tints. Titian has abandoned, more completely than ever\r\nbefore, any attempt to invest the Child with supernatural majesty. He is\r\na delightful, spoiled baby, fully aware of his sovereignty over his\r\nmother, pretending to take no notice of the kneeling suppliants, but\r\noccupying himself in making a tent over his head out of her veil. The\r\n\"Madonna in Glory with six Saints\" of the Vatican is another example of\r\nthe rich and \"smouldering\" colour in which Titian was now creating his\r\ngreat altarpieces, kneading his pigments into a quality, a solidity,\r\nwhich gives reality without heaviness, and finishing with that\r\nfine-grained texture which makes his flesh look like marble endowed\r\nwith life.\r\n\r\n [3] It is this quality of unarrested movement, so conspicuous\r\n above all in the figure of Bacchus, which attracts us irresistibly in\r\n the Huntress, in Lord Brownlow's \"Diana and Actaeon.\" The construction\r\n of the form of the goddess in this beautiful but little-known picture is\r\n admirable. Worn as the colour is, appearing almost as a monochrome, the\r\n landscape is full of atmospheric suggestion. It is in Titian's latest\r\n manner, and its ample lines and free unimpeded motion can be due to no\r\n inferior brush.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Titian._\r\n                 DIANA AND ACTAEON.\r\n                _Earl Brownlow._\r\n                 (_The Medici Society, Ltd._)]\r\n\r\nVenuses, altarpieces, and portraits all tell us how boldly his own style\r\nwas established. His sacred persons are not different from his pagans\r\nand goddesses. Yet though he has gone far, he still reminds us of\r\nGiorgione. He has been constant to the earliest influences which\r\nsurrounded him, and to that temperament which made him accept those\r\ninfluences so instantaneously--and this constancy and unity give him the\r\nuntroubled ascendancy over art which is such a feature of his position.\r\n\r\nWith Leonardo and with Titian, painters had sprung to a recognised\r\nstatus in the great world of the Renaissance. They were no longer the\r\npatronised craftsmen. They had become the courted guests, the social\r\nequals. Titian, passing from the courts of Ferrara to those of Mantua\r\nand Urbino, attended by a band of assistants, was a magnificent\r\npersonage, whose presence was looked upon as a favour, and who undertook\r\na commission as one who conferred a coveted boon. Among those who\r\nclustered closest round the popular favourite, no one did more to\r\nenhance his position than Aretino, the brilliant unscrupulous debauchee,\r\nwit, bully, blackmailer, but a man who, with all his faults, had\r\nevidently his own power of fascination, and, the friend of princes,\r\nmust have been himself the prince of good company. Aretino, as far\r\nas he could be said to be attached to any one, was consistent in his\r\nattachment to Titian from the time they first met at the court of the\r\nGonzaga. He played the part of a chorus, calling attention to the great\r\npainter's merits, jogging the memory of his employers as to payments,\r\nand never ceasing to flatter, amuse, and please him. Titian, for his\r\npart, shows himself equally devoted to Aretino's interests, and has left\r\nvarious characteristic portraits of him, handsome and showy in his\r\nprime, sensual and depraved as age overtook him.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1528 the confraternity of St. Peter Martyr invited\r\nartists to send in sketches for an altarpiece to their patron-saint, in\r\nSS. Giovanni and Paolo, to replace an old one by Jacobello del Fiore.\r\nPalma Vecchio and Pordenone also competed, but Titian carried off the\r\nprize. The picture was delivered in 1530, and during the autumn of 1529\r\nSebastian del Piombo had returned to Venice from Rome, and Michelangelo\r\nhad sought refuge there from Florence and had stayed for some months. A\r\nquarrel with the monks over the price had delayed the picture, so that\r\nit may quite probably have only been begun after intercourse with the\r\nRoman visitors had given a fresh turn to Titian's ideas; for though he\r\nnever ceases to be himself, it certainly seems as if the genius of\r\nMichelangelo had had some effect. From what we know of the altarpiece,\r\nwhich perished by fire in 1867, but of which a good copy by Cigoli\r\nremains, Titian embarked suddenly upon forms of Herculean strength\r\nin violent action, but there his likeness to the Florentine ended;\r\nthe figures were, indeed, drawn with a deep, though not altogether\r\nsuccessful, attention to anatomy and foreshortening, but the picture\r\nobtained its effect and derived its impressiveness from the setting in\r\nwhich the figures were placed--the great trees, bending and straining,\r\nthe hurrying clouds, as if nature were in portentous harmony with the\r\nsinister deed, and overhead the enchanting gleam of light which shot\r\ndownward and irradiated the face of the martyr and the two lovely\r\nwinged boys, bathed in a flood of blue æther, who held aloft the palm of\r\nvictory. Many copies of it remain, and we only regret that one which\r\nRubens executed is not preserved among them.\r\n\r\nWhen we look at the delicious \"Madonna del Coniglio\" in the Louvre and\r\nour own \"Marriage of S. Catherine,\" the first of which certainly, and\r\nthe second probably, was painted about this time, we cannot doubt that\r\nthe charm of the idea of motherhood had particularly arrested the\r\npainter. About 1525 his first son, Pomponio, was born, and was followed\r\nby another son and a daughter. In the S. Catherine he paints that\r\npassion of mother-love with an intensity and reality that can only be\r\ndrawn from life, and on the wheel at her feet he has inscribed his name,\r\nTicianus, F. His feeling for landscape is increasing, and the landscape\r\nin these pictures equals the figures in importance and has engrossed the\r\npainter quite as much. Every year Titian paid a visit to Cadore, and in\r\nthe rich woodlands, the distant villages, the great white villa on the\r\nhill-side, and, above all, in the far-off blue mountains and the glooms\r\nand gleams of storm and sunshine, the sudden dart of rays through the\r\nsummer clouds, which he has painted here, we see how constant was his\r\nstudy of his native country, and how profoundly he felt its poetry and\r\nits charm. He had married Cecilia, the daughter of a barber belonging\r\nto Perarolo, a little town near Cadore. In 1530 she died, and he\r\nmourned her deeply. He went on working and planning for his children's\r\nfuture, and his sister came from Cadore to take charge of the motherless\r\nhousehold; but his friends' letters speak of his being ill from\r\nmelancholy, and he could not go on living in the old house at San\r\nSamuele, which had been his home for sixteen years. He took a new house\r\non the north side of the city, in the parish of San Canciano. The Casa\r\nGrande, as it was called, was a building of importance, which the\r\npainter first hired and finally bought, letting off such apartments as\r\nhe did not need. The first floor had a terrace, and was entered by a\r\nflight of steps from the garden, which overlooked the lagoons, and had a\r\nview of the Cadore mountains. It has been swept away by the building of\r\nthe Fondamenta Nuove, but the documents of the leases are preserved, and\r\nthe exact site is well established. Here his children grew up, and he\r\nworked for them unceasingly. Pomponio, his eldest son, was idle and\r\nextravagant, a constant source of trouble, and Aretino writes him\r\nreproachful letters, which he treats with much impertinence. Orazio took\r\nto his father's profession, and was his constant companion, and often\r\ndrew his cartoons; and his beautiful daughter, Lavinia, was his greatest\r\njoy and pride. In this house Titian showed constant hospitality, and\r\nthere are records of the princely fashion in which he entertained his\r\nfriends and distinguished foreign visitors. Priscianese, a well-known\r\nHumanist and _savant_ of the day, describes a Bacchanalian feast on\r\nthe 1st of August, in a pleasant garden belonging to Messer Tiziano\r\nVecellio. Aretino, Sansovino, and Jacopo Nardi were present. Till the\r\nsun set they stayed indoors, admiring the artist's pictures. \"As soon as\r\nit went down, the tables were spread, looking on the lagoons, which soon\r\nswarmed with gondolas full of beautiful women, and resounded with music\r\nof voices and instruments, which till midnight, accompanied our\r\ndelightful supper. Titian gave the most delicate viands and precious\r\nwines, and the supper ended gaily.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1532 Titian for the first time sought other than Italian\r\npatronage. Charles V., who was then at the height of his power, with all\r\nItaly at his feet, passed through Mantua, and among all the treasures\r\nthat he saw was most struck by Titian's portrait of Federigo Gonzaga.\r\nAfter much writing to and fro, it was arranged that Titian should meet\r\nthe Emperor at Bologna, where he had just been crowned. He made his\r\nfirst sketch of him, from which he afterwards produced a finished full\r\nlength. It was the first of many portraits, and Vasari declares that\r\nfrom that time forth Charles would never sit to any other master. He\r\nreceived a knighthood, and many commissions from members of the\r\nEmperor's court. It was for one of his nobles, da Valos, Marquis of\r\nVasto, that he painted the allegorical piece in the Louvre, in which\r\nMary of Arragon, the lovely wife of da Valos, is parting with her\r\nhusband, who is bound on one of the desperate expeditions against the\r\nterrible Turks. Da Valos is dressed in armour, and the couple are\r\nencircled by Hymen, Victory, and the God of Love. The composition was\r\nrepeated more than once, but never with quite the same success. We again\r\nsuspect the influence of Michelangelo in the altarpiece painted before\r\nTitian next left Venice, of St. John the Almsgiver, for the Church of\r\nthat name, of which the Doge was patron. The figures are life-size, the\r\ntypes stern and rugged, daringly foreshortened, and the colours, though\r\ngorgeous, are softened and broken by broad effects of light and shade.\r\nIt is painted in a solemn mood, a contrast to that in which about this\r\ntime he produced a series of beautiful female portraits, nude or\r\nsemi-nude, chiefly, it would appear, at the instance of the Duke of\r\nUrbino. The Duke at this time was the General-in-Chief of the Venetian\r\nforces, a position which took him often to Venice, and Titian's\r\nrelations with him lasted till the painter's death. At least twenty-five\r\nof his works must have adorned the castles of Urbino and Pesaro. Among\r\nthese were the Venus of the Uffizi, \"La Bella di Tiziano,\" in her\r\ngorgeous scheme of blue and amethyst, the \"Girl in a Fur Cloak,\" besides\r\nportraits of the Duke and Duchess. It would be impossible to enumerate\r\nhere the numbers of portraits which Titian was now supplying. The\r\nreputation he had acquired, not only in Italy, but in Spain, France, and\r\nGermany, was greater than had ever been attained by any painter, while\r\nhis social position was established among the highest in every court.\r\n\"He had rivals in Venice,\" says Vasari, \"but none that he did not\r\ncrush by his excellence and knowledge of the world in converse with\r\ngentlemen.\" There is not a writer of the day who does not acclaim his\r\ngenius. Titian was undoubtedly very fond of money, and had amassed a\r\ngood fortune. He was constantly asking for favours, and had pensions and\r\nallowances from royal patrons. Lavinia, when she married, brought her\r\nhusband a dowry of 1400 ducats. He had painted the portraits of the\r\nDoges with tolerable regularity, but all through his life complaints\r\nwere heard of his neglect of the work of the Hall of Grand Council.\r\nOccupied as he was with the work of his foreign patrons, he had\r\nsystematically neglected the conditions enjoined by his possession of a\r\nBroker's patent, and the Signoria suddenly called on him to refund the\r\nsalary amounting to over 100 ducats a year, for the twenty years during\r\nwhich he had drawn it without performing his promise, while they\r\nprepared to instal Pordenone, who had lately appeared as his bitter\r\nrival, in his stead. Though Titian must have been making large sums of\r\nmoney at this time, his expenses were heavy, and he could not calmly\r\nface the obligation to repay such a sum as 2000 ducats at the same time\r\nthat he lost the annual salary, nor was it pleasant to be ousted by a\r\nsecond-rate rival. His easy remedy was, however, in his own hands; he\r\nset to work and soon completed a great canvas of the \"Battle of Cadore,\"\r\nwhich, though it is only known to us from a contemporary print and a\r\ndrawing by Rubens, evidently deserved Vasari's verdict of being the\r\nfinest battlepiece ever placed in the hall. The movement and stir he\r\ncontrives to give with a small number of figures is astonishing. The\r\nfortress burns upon the hill-side, a regiment advancing with lances and\r\npennons produces the illusion that it is the vanguard of a great army,\r\nthe desperate conflict by the narrow bridge realises all the terrors of\r\nwar. It was an atonement for his long period of neglect, but it was not\r\ntill 1439 [TN: Pordenone died in 1539] that, Pordenone having suddenly\r\ndied, the Signoria relented and reinstated Titian in his Broker's\r\npatent. One of his later paintings for the State still keeps its place,\r\n\"The Triumph of Faith,\" in which Doge Grimani, a splendid, steel-clad\r\nform with flowing mantle, kneels before the angelic apparition of Faith,\r\nwho holds a cross, which angels and cherubs help her to support.\r\nBeneath the clouds are seen the Venetian fleet, the Ducal Palace, and\r\nthe Campanile. It is an allegory of Grimani's life; his defeat and\r\ncaptivity are symbolised by the cross and chalice, and the magnificent\r\nfigure of St. Mark with the lion is introduced to show that the Doge\r\nbelieves himself to owe his freedom to the saint's intercession. The\r\nprophet and standard-bearer at the sides were added by Marco Vecellio.\r\n\r\nThough the battlepiece perished in the fire of 1577, another masterpiece\r\nof this time marks a climax in Titian's brilliantly coloured and highly\r\nfinished style. The \"Presentation of the Virgin\" was painted for the\r\nrefectory of the Confraternity of the Carità, which was housed in the\r\nbuilding now used as the Academy, so that the picture remains in the\r\nplace for which it was executed. It is one of the most vivid and\r\nlife-like of all his works. The composition is the traditional one;\r\nthe fifteen steps of the \"Gospel of Mary,\" the High Priest of the old\r\ndispensation welcoming the childish representative of the new. Below is\r\na great crowd, but it is this little figure which first attracts the\r\neye. The contrast between the mass of architecture and the free and\r\nglowing country beyond is not without meaning, and a broken Roman torso,\r\nlying neglected on the ground, symbolises the downfall of the Pagan\r\nEmpire. The flight of steps, with the figure sitting below them, is\r\nan idea borrowed from Carpaccio, and perhaps taken by him from the\r\nsketch-book of Jacopo Bellini. The men on the left are portraits of\r\nmembers and patrons of the confraternity. Most Titianesque are the\r\nbeautiful women in rich dresses at the foot of the steps. In this\r\nstately composition we see what is often noticeable in Titian's scenes;\r\nhe brings in the bystanders after the manner of a Greek chorus. They\r\nall, with one accord, express the same sentiment. There is a certain\r\nacceptation of the obvious in Titian, a vein of simplicity flows through\r\nhis nature. He has not the sensitive and subtle search after the motives\r\nof humanity which we find in Tintoretto or Lotto. He has great\r\nintellectual power, but not great imagination. It is a temper which\r\nhelps to keep the unity, the monumental quality of his scenes\r\nundisturbed and adds to their effect. In the \"Ecce Homo\" Christ is shown\r\nto the populace by Pilate, who with dubious compliment is a portrait of\r\nAretino, and the contrast of the lonely, broken-down man with the crowd\r\nwhich, with all its lower instincts let loose, thunders back the cry of\r\n\"Crucify Him,\" is the more dramatic because of the unanimous spirit\r\nwhich possesses the raging multitude. Other artists would have given\r\nmore incidental byplay, and drawn off our attention from the main\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTitian (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Titian was executing portraits of the Doges, of Aretino and of\r\nIsabella of Portugal, and of himself and his daughter Lavinia, he was\r\nalso striking out a new line in the ceiling pictures for the Church of\r\nSan Spirito, which have since been transferred to the Salute. Though\r\npainted before his journey to Rome, it may be suspected that he had\r\nMichelangelo's work in the Sixtine Chapel in mind, and that he was\r\nsetting himself the task of bold foreshortening and technical problems.\r\nThe daring of the conception is great, yet we feel sure that this is not\r\nTitian's element; his figures in violent movement give a vivid idea of\r\nstrength and muscular force, but fail both in grace and drawing, and\r\nthough the colour and light and shade distract our attention from\r\ndefects of form, he does not possess that mastery over the flowing\r\nsilhouette which Tintoretto attained.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1543 that his relations with the Farnese, whose young cardinal\r\nhe had been painting, drew him at last to Rome. Leo X. had tried to\r\nattract him there without success, but now at sixty-eight he found\r\nhimself as far on the road as Urbino. His son Orazio was with him, and\r\nDuke Guidobaldo was himself his escort, and sent him on with a band of\r\nmen-at-arms from Pesaro. He was received in Rome by Cardinal Bembo; Paul\r\nIII. gave him a cordial welcome and Vasari was appointed his cicerone.\r\nIt is interesting to inquire what impression Rome, with its treasures of\r\nantique statuary and contemporary painting, made upon Titian. \"He is\r\nfilled with wonder and glad that he came,\" writes Bembo. In a letter to\r\nAretino he regrets that he had not come before. He stayed eight months\r\nin Rome, and was made a Roman citizen. He visits the Stanze of Raphael\r\nin company with Sebastian del Piombo, and Michelangelo comes to see him\r\nat his lodgings, and he receives a long letter from Aretino advising him\r\nto compare Michelangelo with Raphael, and Sansovino and Bramante with\r\nthe sculptors and architects of antiquity. Titian was well established\r\nin his own style, and was received as the creator of acknowledged\r\nmasterpieces, and he never painted a more magnificent portrait-piece\r\nthan that of Paul III., the peevish old Pope, ailing and humorous,\r\nsuspicious of the two nephews who are painted with him, and who he\r\nguessed to be conspiring against him. The characteristic attitude of the\r\nold man of eighty, bent down in his chair, his quick, irritable glance,\r\nthe steady, determined gaze of the cardinal, the obsequious attitude and\r\nweak, wily face of Ottavio Farnese are all immortalised in a broader,\r\nmore careless technique than Titian has hitherto used. Though he does\r\nnot seem to have been directly influenced by all he saw in Rome, we\r\nundoubtedly find a change coming over his work between 1540 and 1550,\r\nwhich may be in part ascribed to a widening of his artistic horizon and\r\na consciousness of what others were doing, both around him and abroad.\r\nIn its whole handling and character his late is different from his early\r\nmanner. It begins at this time to take on a blurred, soft, impressionist\r\ncharacter. His delight in rich colouring seems to wane, and he aims at\r\nintensifying the power of light. He reaches that point in the Venetian\r\nSchool of painting which we may regard as its climax, when there is\r\nlittle strong local colour, but the canvas seems illumined from within.\r\nThere are no clear-cut lines, but the shapes are suggested by sombre\r\nenveloping shades in which the radiant brightness is embedded. His\r\nlandscapes alter too; they are no longer blue and smiling, filled with\r\nloving detail, but grander, more mysterious. In the \"St. Jerome\" in\r\nParis the old Saint kneels in wild and lonely surroundings, and the\r\nmoon, slowly rising behind the dark trees, sends a sharp, silver ray\r\nacross the crucifix. The \"Supper at Emmaus\" has the grandiose effect\r\nthat is given by avoidance of detail and simplification of method.\r\n\r\nTitian painted several portraits of himself, and we know what sort of\r\nstately figure was presented by the old man of seventy who, at Christmas\r\nin 1547, set forth to ride across the Alps in the depths of winter to\r\nobey Charles V.'s call to Augsburg. The excitement of the public was\r\ngreat at his departure, and Aretino describes how his house was besieged\r\nfor the sketches and designs he left behind him. For nearly forty years\r\nTitian was employed by the House of Hapsburg. He had been working for\r\nCharles since 1530, and when the Emperor abdicated, his employment by\r\nPhilip II. lasted till his death. The palace inventory of 1686 contained\r\nseventy-six Titians, and though probably not all were genuine, yet an\r\nimmense number were really by him, and the gallery, even now, is richer\r\nin his works than any other.\r\n\r\nThe great hall of the Pardo must have been a wonderful sight, with\r\nTitian's finest portrait of himself in the midst, and the magnificent\r\nportraits and sacred and allegorical pieces which he continued from this\r\ntime forward to contribute to it. In this year, which was the last\r\nbefore Charles's abdication, and during this visit to South Germany, he\r\npainted the great equestrian portrait of the Emperor on the field of\r\nMühlberg, and two years later came the first of his many portraits of\r\nPhilip II. The face, in the first sketch, is laid in with a sort of\r\nfury of impressionism, and in the parade portrait the sitter is\r\nrealised as a man of great distinction. Ugly and sensual as he is,\r\nwe never tire of looking at Titian's conception--a full length of\r\ndistinguished mien rendered attractive by magnificent colour. Everything\r\nin it lives, and the slender, aristocratic hands are, as Morelli says, a\r\nwhole biography in themselves.\r\n\r\nThe splendid series of allegorical subjects which Titian contributed to\r\nthe Pardo, while he was still supplying sacred pictures and altarpieces\r\nto Venice and the neighbouring mainland, are among his most mature and\r\nimportant works. Never has his gamut of tones been fuller and stronger\r\nthan in the \"Jupiter and Antiope,\" or the \"Venus of the Pardo\" as it is\r\nsometimes called. The Venus herself has the attitude of Giorgione's\r\ndreaming goddess, with her arm flung up above her head. It is, perhaps,\r\nthe only time that Titian succeeds in giving anything ideal to one of\r\nhis Venuses. The famous nudes of the Uffizi and the Louvre are splendid\r\ncourtesans, far removed from Giorgione's idyllic vision; but Antiope,\r\nslumbering on her couch of skins, and her woodland lover, gazing with\r\nadoring eyes on her beautiful face, have a whole world of sweet and\r\njoyful fancy. The whole scene is full of a _joie de vivre_, which\r\ncarries us back to the Bacchanals painted so many years before, and in\r\nthese Titian gives King Philip his most perfect work, every touch of\r\nwhich is his own. This picture, now in the Louvre, was given to Charles\r\nI. by the King of Spain, and bought for Cardinal Mazarin in 1650.\r\n\"Danaë,\" \"Venus and Adonis,\" \"Europa and the Bull,\" and a \"Last Supper\"\r\nfollowed in quick succession, but Titian was now employing many\r\nassistants, and great parts of the canvases issuing from his workshop\r\nshow weak, imitative hands, while replicas were made of other works.\r\n\r\nHis later feeling for the religious in art is expressed in the now\r\nbedimmed paintings in San Salvatore in Venice. Vasari describes\r\nthese in 1566. Painted when Titian was nearly ninety years old, the\r\n\"Transfiguration\" is remarkable for forcible, majestic movement, while\r\nin the \"Annunciation\" he invents quite a new treatment. Mary turns round\r\nand raises her veil, while she grasps the book as if she depended on it\r\nfor stay and support. The four angels are full of life and gaiety, and\r\nthe whole has much grace and colour, though it is dashed in, in the\r\npainter's later style, in broad and sweeping planes without patience\r\nof detail. The old man has signed it \"Titianus, fecit, fecit,\" a\r\ncontemptuous reply to some critics who complained of its want of finish.\r\nHe knew well what it was in composition and execution, and that all that\r\nhe had ever known or done lay within the careless strength of his last\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nA letter written to the King of Spain's secretary in 1574 gives\r\na list \"in part\" of fourteen pictures sent to Madrid during the last\r\ntwenty-five years, \"with many others which I do not remember.\" On every\r\nhand we hear of lost pictures from the master's brush, and the number\r\nproduced even during the last ten years of his life must have been\r\nenormous, for till the end he was full of great undertakings and\r\nachievements. Very late in life he painted a \"Shepherd and Nymph\"\r\n(Vienna), which in its idyllic feeling, its slumberous delight, its\r\nmingling of clothed and nude figures, recalls the early days with\r\nGiorgione, yet the blurred and smouldering richness, the absolute\r\nnegation of all sharp lines and lights is in his very latest style, and\r\nhe has gone past Giorgione on his own ground. Then in strange contrast\r\nis the \"Christ Crowned with Thorns,\" at Vienna, a tragic figure\r\nstupefied with suffering. His last great work was the \"Pietà\" in\r\nthe Academy, which, though unfinished, is nobly designed and very\r\nimpressive. He places the Virgin supporting the Body in a great\r\ndome-shaped niche, which gives elevation. It is flanked by two calm,\r\nantique, stone figures, whose impassive air contrasts with the wild pain\r\nand grief below. The Magdalen steps out towards the spectator with the\r\nwailing cry of a Greek tragedy. It perhaps hardly moves us like the\r\nconcentrated feeling of Bellini's Madonna, or the hurried, trembling\r\ngrief of Tintoretto's Magdalen, but it is monumental in the sweeping\r\ngrace of its line, and full of nobility of feeling. It is sadly rubbed\r\nand darkened and has lost much of Titian's colour, but is still\r\nbeautiful in its deep greys mingled with a sombre golden glow, as\r\nof half-extinguished fires. These late paintings are of the true\r\nimpressionist order; looked at closely they present a mass of scumbled\r\ntouches, of incoherent dashes, but if we step farther away, to the\r\nright focus, light and dark arrange themselves, order shines through the\r\nwhole, and we see what the great master meant us to see. \"Titian's later\r\ncreations,\" says Vasari, \"are struck off rapidly, so that when close you\r\ncannot see them, but afar they look perfect, and this is the style which\r\nso many tried to imitate, to show that they were practised hands, but\r\nonly produced absurdities.\" Titian was preparing the picture for the\r\nFrari, in payment for the grant of a tomb for himself, when in August\r\n1576 the plague broke out in Venice, and on the 27th the great painter\r\ndied of it in his own house. The stringent regulations concerning\r\ninfection were relaxed to do honour to one of the greatest sons of\r\nVenice, and he was laid to rest in the Frari, borne there in solemn\r\nprocession, through a city stricken by terror and panic, and buried\r\nin the Chapel of the Crucified Saviour, for which his last work was\r\nordered. The \"Assumption\" of his prime looked down upon him, and close\r\nat hand was the \"Madonna of Casa Pesaro.\" His son Orazio caught the\r\nplague and died immediately after, and the painter's house was sacked\r\nby thieves and many precious things stolen.\r\n\r\nThe great personality of Titian stands out as that which of all others\r\nestablished and consolidated the school of Venice. He is its central\r\nfigure. The century of life, of which eighty years were passed in\r\nceaseless industry of production, left its deep impression on the art of\r\nevery civilised country of Europe. Every great man of the day who was a\r\nlover of art and culture fell under Titian's spell. His influence on his\r\ncontemporaries was enormous, and he had everything: genius, industry,\r\npersonal distinction, character, social charm. He is, perhaps, of too\r\nintellectual a cast of mind to be quite typical of the Venetian spirit,\r\nin the way that Tintoretto is; it is conceivable that in another\r\nenvironment Titian might have developed on rather different lines,\r\nbut this temper gave him greater domination. He was free from the\r\neccentricities which beset genius. He possessed the saving salt of\r\npractical common sense, so that the golden mean of sanity and healthful\r\njoy in his works commended them to all men, and they are not difficult\r\nto understand. Yet while all can see the beauty of his poetic instinct\r\nfor colour, his interesting and original technique, his grasp and\r\nscope, his mastery and certainty have gained for him the title of \"the\r\npainter's painter.\" There is no one from whom men feel that they can so\r\nsafely learn so much, and the grand breadth and power of elimination of\r\nhis later years is justified by the way in which in his earlier work he\r\nhas carried exquisite finish and rich impasto to perfection.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\r\n\r\n Ancona.

But he was classed with the\r\ngreatest, and influenced contemporary art because his work chimed in\r\nso well with the Venetian spirit. A Bergamasque by birth, he came of\r\nVenetian parentage, and learnt the first elements of his art in Venice.\r\nHe never really mastered the inner niceties of anatomy in its finest\r\nsense, and the broad generalisation of his forms may be meant to conceal\r\nuncertain drawing, but his large-bosomed, matronly women and plump\r\nchildren, his round, soft contours, his clean brilliancy, and the clear\r\ngolden polish in which his pictures are steeped, made a great appeal to\r\nthe public. His invention is the large Santa Conversazione, as compared\r\nwith those in half-length of the earlier masters. The Virgin and saints\r\nand kneeling or bending donors are placed under the spreading trees\r\nof a rich and picturesque landscape. It is Palma's version of the\r\nGiorgionesque ideal, which he had his share in establishing and\r\ndeveloping. The heavy tree-trunk and dark foliage, silhouetted almost\r\nblack against the background, are characteristic of his compositions. As\r\nhis life goes on, though he still clings to his full, ripe figures and\r\nto the same smooth fleshiness in his women, the features become delicate\r\nand chiselled, and the more refined type and subtler feeling of his\r\nmiddle stage may be due to his companionship with Lotto, with whom he\r\nwas in Bergamo when they were both about twenty-five. He touches his\r\nhighest, and at the same time keeps very near Giorgione, in the\r\nsplendid St. Barbara, painted for the company of the _Bombadieri_ or\r\nartillerists. Their cannon guard the pedestal on which she stands; it\r\nwas at her altar that they came to commend themselves on going forth to\r\nwar, and where they knelt to offer thanksgiving for a safe return; and\r\nshe is a truly noble figure, regal in conception and fine and firm in\r\nexecution, attired in sumptuous robes of golden brown and green, with\r\nsplendid saints on either hand. Palma was often approached by his\r\npatrons who wanted mythological scenes, gods, and goddesses; but though\r\nhe produced a Venus, a handsome, full-blown model, he never excels in\r\nthe nude, and his tendency is to seize upon the homely. His scenes have\r\na domestic, familiar flavour. With all his golden and ivory beauty he\r\nlacks fire, and his personages have a sluggish, plethoric note. In his\r\nlatest stage he hides all sharpness in a sort of scumble or haze. It\r\nwould, however, be unfair to say he is not fine, and his portraits\r\nespecially come very near the best. Vienna is rich in examples in\r\nhalf-lengths of one beautiful woman after another robed in the ample and\r\ngorgeous garments in which he is always interested. Among them is his\r\nhandsome daughter, Violante, with a violet in her bosom, and wearing the\r\nlarge sleeves he admires. The \"Tasso\" of the National Gallery has been\r\ntaken from him and given first to Giorgione and then to Titian, but\r\nthere now seems some inclination to return it to its first author. It\r\nhas a more dreamy, intellectual countenance than we are accustomed to\r\nassociate with Palma; but he uses elsewhere the decorative background\r\nof olive branches, and the waxen complexion, tawny colouring, and the\r\npronounced golden haze are Palmesque in the highest degree. The\r\ncolouring is in strong contrast to the pale ivory glow of the Ariosto\r\nof Titian, which hangs near it.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Palma Vecchio._\r\n                 HOLY FAMILY.\r\n                _Colonna Gallery, Rome._\r\n                 (_Photo, Anderson._)]\r\n\r\nNo one could be more unlike Palma than his contemporary, Lorenzo Lotto,\r\nwho has for long been classed with the Bergamasques, but who is proved\r\nby recently discovered documents to have been born in Venice. It was\r\nfor long an accepted fact that Lotto was a pupil of Bellini, and his\r\nearliest altarpiece, to S. Cristina at Treviso, bears traces of\r\nBellini's manner. A Pietà above has child angels examining the wounds\r\nwith the grief and concern which Bellini made so peculiarly his own, and\r\nthe St. Jerome and the branch of fig-leaves silhouetted against the\r\nlight remind us of the altarpiece in S. Crisostomo. Lotto seems to have\r\nclung to quattrocento fashions. The ancona had long been rejected by\r\nmost of his contemporaries, but he painted one of the last for a church\r\nin Recanati, in carved and gilt compartments, and he painted predellas\r\nlong after they had become generally obsolete. We ask ourselves how it\r\nwas that Lotto, who had so susceptible and easily swayed a nature,\r\nescaped the influence of Giorgione, the most powerful of any in the\r\nVenice of his youth--an influence which acted on Bellini in his old age,\r\nwhich Titian practically never shook off, and which dominated Palma to\r\nthe exclusion of any earlier master.\r\n\r\nIt would take too long to survey the train of argument by which\r\nMr. Berenson has established Alvise Vivarini as the master of Lotto.\r\nNotwithstanding that Bellini's great superiority was becoming clear to\r\nthe more cultured Venetians, Alvise, when Lotto was a youth, was still\r\nthe painter _par excellence_ for the mass of the public. In the S.\r\nCristina altarpiece the Child standing on its Mother's knee is in the\r\nsame attitude as the Child in Alvise's altarpiece of 1480, and the\r\nMother's hand holds it in the same way. Other details which supply\r\ninternal evidence are the shape of hands and feet, the round heads and\r\nthe way the Child is often represented lying across the Mother's knees.\r\nLotto carries into old age the use of fruit and flowers and beads as\r\ndecoration, a Squarcionesque feature beloved of the Vivarini, but which\r\nwas never adopted by Bellini.\r\n\r\nAbout 1512 Lotto comes into contact with Palma, and for a short time the\r\ntwo were in close touch. A \"Santa Conversazione,\" of which a good copy\r\nexists in Villa Borghese, Rome, and one at Dresden, with the Holy Family\r\ngrouped under spreading trees, is saturated with Palma's spirit, but it\r\nsoon passes away, and except for an occasional touch, disappears\r\nentirely from Lotto's work.\r\n\r\nLotto may have had relations in Bergamo, for when in 1515 a competition\r\nbetween artists was set on foot by Alessandro Martino, a descendant of\r\nGeneral Colleone, for an altarpiece for S. Stefano, he competed and\r\ncarried off the prize. This was the first of the series of the great\r\nworks for Bergamo, which enrich the little city, where at this period\r\nhe can best be studied. The great altarpiece (now removed to San\r\nBartolommeo) is a most interesting human document, a revelation of the\r\npainter's personality. He does not break away from hieratic conventions,\r\nlike the rival school; his Madonna is still placed in the apse of the\r\nchurch with saints grouped round her, a form from which the Vivarini\r\nnever departed, but the whole is full of intense movement, of a lyric\r\ngrace and ecstasy, a desire to express fervent and rapturous devotion.\r\nThe architectural background is not in happy proportion in relation to\r\nthe figures, but the effect of vista and space is more remarkable than\r\nin any North Italian master. The vivid treatment of light and shade, and\r\nthe gaiety and delicacy of the flying angels, who hold the canopy, and\r\nof the putti, who spread the carpet below, the shapes of throne and\r\ncanopy and the decorations have led to the idea that Lotto drew his\r\ninspiration from Correggio, whom he certainly resembles in some ways;\r\nbut at this time Correggio was only twenty, and had not given any\r\nexamples of the style we are accustomed to call Correggiesque. We must\r\nlook back to a common origin for those decorative details, which are so\r\nconspicuous in Crivelli and Bartolommeo Vivarini, which came to Lotto\r\nthrough the Vivarini and to Correggio through Ferrarese painters, and\r\nof which the fountain-head for both was the school of Squarcione. For\r\nthe much more striking resemblances of composition and spirit, the\r\nexplanation seems to be that Lotto on one side of his nature was akin\r\nto Correggio; he had the same lyrical feeling, the same inclination to\r\nexuberance and buoyancy. To both, painting was a vehicle for the\r\nexpression of feeling, but Lotto had also common sense and a goodly\r\nshare of that humour that is allied to pathos.\r\n\r\nTill the year 1526 Lotto was much in Bergamo, where the first altarpiece\r\ngained him orders for others. The reputation of a member of the school\r\nof Venice was a sure passport to employment. We trace Alvise's tradition\r\nvery plainly in the altarpiece in San Bernardino, where the gesture of\r\nthe Madonna's hand as she expounds to the listening saints recalls\r\nAlvise's of 1480. The little gathered roses, which Lotto makes use\r\nof to the end of his life, lie scattered on the step; angels, daringly\r\nforeshortened, sweep aside the curtain of the sanctuary. The colour is\r\nin Lotto's scarlet, light blues, and violet. He soon shows himself fond\r\nof genre incidents, and in \"Christ taking leave of His Mother\" gives a\r\nview into a bedroom and a cat running across the floor. The donor kneels\r\nwith her hair fashionably dressed and wearing a pearl necklace. In the\r\n\"Marriage of S. Catherine\" at Bergamo the saint is evidently a portrait,\r\nwith hair pearl-wreathed. She kneels very simply and naturally before\r\nthe Child, and the exquisitely lovely and elaborately gowned young woman\r\nwho represents the Madonna, looks out towards the spectator with a\r\nmundane and curiously modern air. It was probably the recognition\r\nof Lotto's success with portraits that led to their being so often\r\nintroduced into his sacred pieces. In the one we have just noticed, the\r\ndonor, Niccolas Bonghi, is brought in, and is on rather a larger scale\r\nthan the rest, but Lotto has evidently not found him interesting. The\r\nportraits of the brothers della Torre, and that of the Prothonotary\r\nGiuliano in the National Gallery, inaugurate that wonderful series\r\nof characterisations which are his greatest distinction. A series of\r\nfrescoes in village churches round Bergamo must also be noticed. They\r\nare remarkable for spontaneous and original decoration, and may compare\r\nwith the ceremonial groups of Gentile Bellini and Carpaccio. Lotto's\r\npersonages, as they chatter in the market-places, are full of natural\r\nanimation and gaiety, and we realise what a step had been made in the\r\npainting of actual life.\r\n\r\nOwing to the unsettled state of the rest of Italy, the years\r\nfrom 1530 to 1540, which Lotto spent in Venice, found that city the\r\ngathering-ground of many of the most distinguished scholars and deepest\r\nthinkers of the day. Men of all shades of religious thought were engaged\r\nin learned discussion, and Lotto's ardent and inquiring temperament must\r\nhave been stimulated by such an environment. During these years, too, he\r\nbecame intimate with Titian, and experimented in Titian's style, with\r\nthe result that his painting gets thicker and richer, more fused and\r\nsolid, and his figures are better put together. He imitates Titian's\r\ncolour, too, but it makes him paint in deeper, fiercer tints, and he\r\nsoon finds it does not suit him, and returns to his own scheme. His\r\ncolour is still rather too dazzling, but the distances are translucent\r\nand atmospheric. He continues to introduce portraits. In his altarpiece\r\nin SS. Giovanni and Paolo the deacons giving alms and receiving\r\npetitions curiously resemble in type and expression the ecclesiastics\r\nwe see to-day.\r\n\r\nLotto was now an accepted member of Titian's set, and Aretino, in a\r\nletter dated 1548, writes that Titian values his taste and judgment as\r\nthat of no other; but Aretino, with his usual mixture of connoisseurship\r\nand clever spite, goes on to insinuate accidentally, as it were, what he\r\nhimself knew perfectly well, that Lotto was not considered on a par with\r\nthe masters of the first rank. \"Envy is not in your breast,\" he says,\r\n\"rather do you delight to see in other artists certain qualities which\r\nyou do not find in your own brush, ... holding the second place in the\r\nart of painting is nothing compared to holding the first place in the\r\nduties of religion.\"\r\n\r\nAn interesting codex or commentary tells us that Lotto never received\r\nhigh prices for his work, and we hear of him hawking pictures about in\r\nartistic circles, putting them up in raffles, and leaving a number with\r\nJacopo Sansovino in the hope that he might hear of buyers. His work\r\nended as it had begun, in the Marches. He undertook commissions at\r\nRecanati, Ancona, and Loreto, and in September 1554 he concluded a\r\ncontract with the Holy House at Loreto, by which, in return for rooms\r\nand food, he made over himself and all his belongings to the care of the\r\nfraternity, \"being tired of wandering, and wishing to end his days in\r\nthat holy place.\" He spent the last four years of his life at Loreto\r\nas a votary of the Virgin, painting a series of pictures which are\r\ndistinguished by the same sort of apparent looseness and carelessness\r\nwhich we noticed in Titian's late style; a technique which, as in\r\nTitian's case, conceals a profound knowledge of plastic modelling.\r\n\r\nThough Lotto executed an immense number of important and very beautiful\r\nsacred works, his portraits stand apart, and are so interesting to the\r\nmodern mind that one is tempted to linger over them. Other painters give\r\nus finer pictures; in none do we feel so anxious to know who the sitters\r\nwere and what was their story. Lotto has nothing of the Pagan quality\r\nwhich marks Giorgione and Titian; he is a born psychologist, and as such\r\nhe witnesses to an attitude of mind in the Italy of his day which is of\r\npeculiar interest to our own. Lotto's bystanders, even in his sacred\r\nscenes, have nothing in common with Titian's \"chorus\"; they have the\r\ncharacterisation of distinct individuals, and when he is concerned with\r\nactual portraits he is intensely receptive and sensitive to the spirit\r\nof his sitters. He may be said to \"give them away,\" and to take an\r\nalmost unfair advantage of his perception. The sick man in the Doria\r\nGallery looks like one stricken with a death sentence. He knows at least\r\nthat it is touch and go, and the painter has symbolised the situation in\r\nthe little winged genius balancing himself in a pair of scales. In the\r\nBorghese Gallery is the portrait of a young, magnificently dressed man,\r\nwith a countenance marked by mental agitation, who presses one hand to\r\nhis heart, while the other rests on a pile of rose-petals in which a\r\ntiny skull is half-hidden. The \"Old Man\" in the Brera has the hard,\r\nnarrow, but intensely sad face of one whose natural disposition has\r\nbeen embittered by the circumstances of his life, just as that of our\r\nProthonotary speaks of a large and gentle nature, mellowed by natural\r\naffections and happy pursuits. We smile, as Lotto does, with kindly\r\nmischief at \"Marsilio and his Bride;\" the broad, placid countenance of\r\nthe man is so significantly contrasted with the clever mouth and eyes of\r\nthe bride that it does not need the malicious glance of the cupid, who\r\nis fitting on the yoke, to \"dot the i's and cross the t's\" of their\r\nfuture. Again, the portrait of Laura di Pola, in the Brera, introduces\r\nus to one of those women who are charming in every age, not actually\r\nbeautiful, but harmonious, thoughtful, perfectly dressed, sensible, and\r\nself-possessed, and the \"Family Group\" in our own gallery holds a\r\nhistory of a couple of antagonistic temperaments united by life in\r\ncommon and the clasping hands of children. Lotto does not keep the\r\npersonal expression out of even such a canvas as his \"Triumph of\r\nChastity\" in the Rospigliosi Gallery. His delightful Venus, one of the\r\nloveliest nudes in painting, flies from the attacking termagant, whose\r\nvirtue is proclaimed by the ermine on her breast, and sweeps her little\r\ncupid with her with a well-bred, surprised air, suggestive of the\r\nmanners of mundane society.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Lorenzo Lotto._\r\n                 PORTRAIT OF LAURA DI POLA.\r\n                _Brera._\r\n                 (_Photo, Anderson._)]\r\n\r\nThe painter who was thus able to unveil personality had evidently a mind\r\nthat was aware of itself, that looked forward to a wider civilisation\r\nand a more earnest and intimate religion. His life seems to have been\r\none of some sadness, and crowned with only moderate success. He speaks\r\nof himself as \"advanced in years, without loving care of any kind, and\r\nof a troubled mind.\" His will shows that his worldly possessions were\r\nfew and poor, and that he had no heir closer than a nephew; but he\r\nleaves some of his cartoons as a dowry to \"two girls of quiet nature,\r\nhealthy in mind and body, and likely to make thrifty housekeepers,\" on\r\ntheir marriage to \"two well-recommended young men,\" about to become\r\npainters. His sensitive and introspective temperament led him to prefer\r\nthe retirement and the quiet beauty of Loreto to the brilliant society\r\nof which he was made free in Venice. \"His spirit,\" says Mr. Berenson,\r\n\"is more like our own than is perhaps that of any other Italian\r\npainter, and it has all the appeal and fascination of a kindred soul\r\nin another age.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\r\n\r\n _Palma Vecchio._\r\n\r\n Bergamo.

All the efforts made to secure Titian failed till nearly the end\r\nof his career. On the other hand, Venice was full of less famous masters\r\nfollowing in Giorgione's steps. When Sebastian Luciani was a young man,\r\nGiorgione was paramount there, and no one could have foretold that his\r\nlife would be of such short duration. It was to be expected, therefore,\r\nthat a painter who consulted his own interests should leave the city\r\nwhere he was overshadowed by a great genius and go farther afield. The\r\ninfluence of the Guilds was withdrawn in the sixteenth century, so that\r\nit was a simpler matter for painters to transfer their talents, and\r\npainting was beginning to appeal strongly to the _dilettanti_, who\r\nrivalled one another in their offers.\r\n\r\nOnly one work of Sebastian's is known belonging to this earlier time in\r\nVenice. It is the \"S. Chrysostom enthroned,\" in S. Giovanni Crisostomo,\r\nand its majesty and rich colouring, and more especially the splendid\r\ngroup of women on the left, so proud and soft in their Venetian beauty,\r\nmake us wonder if Sebastian might not have risen to greater heights if\r\nhe had remained in his natural environment. He responded to the call to\r\nRome of Agostino Chigi, the great painter, [TN: Chigi was a banker] art\r\ncollector, and patron, the friend of Leo X. Chigi had just completed\r\nthe Farnesina Villa, and Sebastian was employed till 1512 on its\r\ndecoration, and at once came under the influence of Michelangelo. The\r\n\"Pietà\" at Viterbo shows that influence very strongly; in fact, Vasari\r\nsays that Michelangelo himself drew the cartoon for the figure of\r\nChrist, which would account for its extraordinary beauty. Sebastian\r\nembarked on a close intimacy with the Florentine painter, and,\r\naccording to Vasari, the great canvas of the \"Raising of Lazarus,\" in\r\nthe National Gallery, was executed under the orders and in part from\r\nthe designs of Michelangelo. This colossal work was looked on as one\r\nof the most important creations of the sixteenth century, but there is\r\nlittle to make us wish to change it for the altarpiece of S. Crisostomo.\r\nThe desire for scientific drawing and the search after composition have\r\nproduced a laboured effect; the female figures are cast in a masculine\r\nmould, and it lacks both the severe beauty of the Tuscan School and\r\nthe emotional charm of Sebastian's native style. We cannot, however,\r\navoid conjecturing if in the figure of Lazarus himself we have not a\r\nconception of the great Florentine. It is so easy in pose, so splendid\r\nin its, perhaps excessive, length of limb, that our thoughts turn\r\ninvoluntarily to the _Ignudi_ in the Sixtine Chapel. The picture has\r\nbeen dulled and injured by repainting, but the distance still has the\r\nsombre depth of the Venetians. All through Sebastian's career he seeks\r\nfor form and composition, but, great painter as he undoubtedly is, he\r\nis great because he possesses that inborn feeling for harmony of colour.\r\nThis is what we value in him, and he excels in so far as he follows his\r\nVenetian instincts.\r\n\r\nThe death of Raphael improved Sebastian's position in Rome, and\r\nthough Leo X. never liked or employed him, he did not lack commissions.\r\nThe \"Fornarina\" in the Uffizi, with the laurel-wreathed head and\r\nleopard-skin mantle, still reveals him as the Venetian, and it is\r\ncurious that any critic should ever have assigned its rich, voluptuous\r\ntone and its coarse type to Raphael. Sebastian obtained commissions for\r\ndecorating S. Maria del Popolo in oils and S. Pietro in Montorio in\r\nfresco, but in the latter medium, though he is ambitious of acquiring\r\nthe force of Michelangelo, he lacks the Tuscan ease of hand. Colour,\r\nfor which he possessed so true an aptitude, the deep, fused colour of\r\nGiorgione, is set aside by him; his tints become strong and crude, his\r\nsurfaces grow hard and polished, and he thinks, above all, of bold\r\naction, of drawing and modelling. The Venetian genius for portraiture\r\nremains, and he has left such fine examples as the \"Andrea Doria\" of the\r\nVatican, or the \"Portrait of a Man in the Pitti,\" a masterly picture\r\nboth in drawing and execution, with grand draperies, a fur pelisse, and\r\ndamask doublet with crimson sleeves. In the National Gallery we possess\r\nhis own portrait by himself, in company with Cardinal de Medici. The\r\nfaces are well contrasted, and we judge from Sebastian's that his\r\nbiographer describes him justly, as fat, indolent, and given to\r\nself-indulgence, but genial and fond of good company.\r\n\r\nAfter an absence of twenty years he returned to Venice. There he came\r\nin contact with Titian and Pordenone, and struck up a friendship with\r\nAretino, who became his great ally and admirer. The sack of Rome had\r\ndriven him forth, but in 1529, when the city was beginning partially\r\nto recover from that time of horror, he returned, and was cordially\r\nwelcomed by Clement VII., and admitted into the innermost ecclesiastical\r\ncircles. The Piombo, a well-paid, sinecure office of the Papal court,\r\nwas bestowed on him, and his remaining years were spent in Rome. He\r\nwas very anxious to collaborate with Michelangelo, and the great\r\npainter seems to have been quite inclined to the arrangement. The \"Last\r\nJudgment,\" in the Sixtine Chapel, was suggested, and Sebastian had the\r\nmelancholy task of taking down Perugino's masterpieces; but he wished to\r\nreset the walls for oils, and Michelangelo stipulated for fresco, saying\r\nthat oils were only fit for women, so that no agreement was arrived at.\r\n\r\nSebastian's mode of work was slow, and he employed no assistants. He\r\nseems to have been inordinately lazy, fond of leisure and good living,\r\nand his character shows in his work, which, with a few exceptions, has\r\nsomething heavy and common about it, a want of keenness and fire, an\r\nabsence of refinement and selection.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\r\n\r\n Florence.

All the early historians agree in giving the\r\nname to one master only. Boschini, however, in 1777 discovered the\r\nregister of the death of a second, and a third bearing the name was\r\nworking twenty years later. Upon this Dr. Morelli came to the conclusion\r\nthat we must recognise three, if not four, masters bearing the name of\r\nBonifazio, but documents recently discovered by Professor Ludwig have\r\nin great measure destroyed Morelli's conjectures. There may have been\r\nobscure painters bearing the name, but they were mere imitators, and it\r\nis doubtful if any were related to the family of de Pitatis.\r\n\r\nBonifazio Veronese is really the only one who counts. As Ridolfi says,\r\nhe was born in Verona in the most beautiful moment of painting. He came\r\nto Venice at the age of eighteen, and became a pupil of Palma Vecchio,\r\nwith whom his work has sometimes been confused. After Palma's death\r\nBonifazio continued in friendly relations with his old master's family,\r\nand his niece married Palma's nephew. Bonifazio himself married the\r\ndaughter of a basket-maker, and appears to have had no children, for\r\nhe and his wife by their wills bestowed their whole fortune on their\r\nnephews. Antonio Palma, who married Bonifazio's niece, was a painter\r\nwhose pictures have sometimes been attributed to the legendary third\r\nBonifazio. Bonifazio's life was passed peacefully in Venice. He received\r\nmany important commissions from the Republic, and decorated the Palace\r\nof the Treasurers. His character and standing were high, and he was\r\nappointed, in company with Titian and Lotto, to administer a legacy\r\nwhich Vincenzo Catena had left to provide a yearly dower for five\r\nmaidens. After a long life spent in steady work, Bonifazio withdrew\r\nto a little farm amidst orchards--fifteen acres of land in all--at San\r\nZenone, near Asolo; but he still kept his house in San Marcuola, where\r\nhe died. He was buried in S. Alvise in Venice.\r\n\r\nA son of the plains and of Venetian stock, his work is always graceful\r\nand attractive, though inclined to be hot in colour. It has a very\r\npronounced aristocratic character, and bears no trace of the rough,\r\nprovincial strain of such men as Cariani or Pordenone. It is very fine\r\nand glowing in colour, but lacks vigour and energy in design. Nowhere do\r\nwe get more worldly magnificence or such frank worship of wealth as on\r\nBonifazio's joyous canvases. He represents Christian saints and Eastern\r\nkings alike, as gentlemen of princely rank. There is a note of purely\r\nsecular art about his Adorations and Holy Families. In the \"Adoration of\r\nthe Magi,\" in the Academy, the Madonna is a handsome, prosperous lady of\r\nBonifazio's acquaintance. The Child, so far from raising His hand in\r\nbenediction, holds it out for the proffered cup. He does not, as usual,\r\ndistinguish the eldest king, but singles out the cup held by the second,\r\nwho, in a puffed velvet dress, is an evident portrait, probably that of\r\nthe donor of the picture, who is in this way paid a courtier-like\r\ncompliment. The third king is such a Moor as Bonifazio must often have\r\nseen embarking from his Eastern galley on the Riva dei Schiavoni. A\r\nservant in a peaked hood peers round the column to catch sight of what\r\nis going on. The groups of animals in the background are well rendered.\r\nIn the \"Rich Man's Feast,\" where Lazarus lies upon the step, we have\r\nanother scene of wealthy and sumptuous Venetian society, an orgy of\r\ncolour. And, again, in the \"Finding of Moses\" (Brera) he paints nobles\r\nplaying the lute, making love and feasting, and lovely fair-haired women\r\nlistening complacently. We are reminded of the way in which they lived:\r\ntheir one preoccupation the toilet, the delight of appearing in public\r\nin the latest and most magnificent fashions. And in these paintings\r\nBonifazio depicts the elaborate striped and brocaded gowns in which the\r\nbeautiful Venetians arrayed themselves, made in the very fashions of the\r\nyear, and their thick, fair hair is twisted and coiled in the precise\r\nmode of the moment. The deep-red velvet he introduces into nearly all\r\nhis pictures is of a hue peculiar to himself. As Catena often brings in\r\na little white lap-dog, so Bonifazio constantly has as an accessory a\r\nliver-and-white spaniel.\r\n\r\nVasari speaks of Paris Bordone as the artist who most successfully\r\nimitated Titian. He was the son of well-to-do tradespeople in Treviso,\r\nand received a good education in music and letters, before being sent\r\noff to Venice and placed in Titian's studio. Bordone does not seem to\r\nhave been on very friendly terms with Titian. He was dissatisfied with\r\nhis teaching, and Titian played him an ill turn in wresting from him a\r\ncommission to paint an altarpiece which had been entrusted to him when\r\nhe was only eighteen. He was, above all, in love with the manner of\r\nthe dead Giorgione, and it was upon this master that he aspired to\r\nform his style. His masterpiece, in the Academy, was painted for the\r\nConfraternity of St. Mark, and made his reputation. The legend it\r\nrepresents may be given in a few words:\r\n\r\nIn the days of Doge Gradenigo, one February, there arose a fearful\r\nstorm in Venice. During the height of the tempest, three men accosted a\r\npoor old fisherman, who was lying in his decayed old boat by the Piazza,\r\nand begged that he would row them to S. Niccolo del Lido, where they had\r\nurgent business. After some demur they persuaded him to take the oars,\r\nand in spite of the hurricane, the voyage was accomplished. On reaching\r\nthe shore they pointed out to him a great ship, the crew of which he\r\nperceived to consist of a band of demons, who were stirring up the waves\r\nand making a great hubbub. The three passengers laid their commands on\r\nthem to desist, when immediately they sailed away and there was a calm.\r\nThe passengers then made the oarsman row them, one to S. Niccolo, one to\r\nS. Giorgio, and the third was rowed back to the Piazza. The fisherman\r\ntimidly asked for his fare, and the third passenger desired him to go to\r\nthe Doge and ask for payment, telling him that by that night's work a\r\ngreat disaster had been averted from the city. The fisherman replied\r\nthat he should not be believed, but would be imprisoned as a liar. Then\r\nthe passenger drew a ring from his finger. \"Show him this for a sign,\"\r\nhe said, \"and know that one of those you have this night rowed is S.\r\nNiccolas, the other is S. George, and I am S. Mark the Evangelist,\r\nProtector of the Venetian Republic.\" He then disappeared. The next day\r\nthe fisherman presented the ring, and was assigned a provision for life\r\nfrom the Senate.\r\n\r\nThere has, perhaps, never been a richer and more beautiful\r\nsubject-picture painted than this glowing canvas, or one which brings\r\nmore vividly before us the magnificence of the pageants which made\r\nsuch a part of Venetian life in the golden age of painting. It is all\r\nstrength and splendour, and escapes the hectic colour and weaker type\r\nwhich appear in Bordone's \"Last Supper\" and some of his other works. In\r\n1538 he went to France and entered the service of Francis II., painting\r\nfor him many portraits of ladies, besides works for the Cardinals of\r\nGuise and of Lorraine. The King of Poland sent to him for a \"Jupiter and\r\nAntiope.\" At Augsburg he was paid 3000 crowns for work done for the\r\ngreat Fugger family.\r\n\r\nNo one gives us so closely as Bordone the type of woman who at this time\r\nwas most admired in Venice. The Venetian ideal was golden haired, with\r\nfull lips, fair, rosy cheeks, large limbed and ample, with \"abundant\r\nflanks and snow-white breast.\" A type glowing with health and instinct\r\nwith life, but, to say the truth, rather dull, without deep passions,\r\nand with no look that reveals profound emotions or the struggle of a\r\nsoul. From what we see of Bordone's female portraits and from some of\r\nthe mythological compositions he has left, he might have been among the\r\nmost sensually minded of men. His beautiful courtesan, in the National\r\nGallery, is an almost over-realistic presentment of a woman who has\r\njust parted from her lover. His women, with their carnation cheeks and\r\nexpressionless faces, are like beautiful animals; but, as a matter\r\nof fact, their painter was sober and temperate in his life, very\r\nindustrious, and devoted to his widowed mother. About 1536 he married\r\nthe daughter of a Venetian citizen, and had a son, who became one of the\r\nmany insignificant painters of the end of the sixteenth century. Most\r\nof his days were divided between his little Villa of Lovadina in the\r\ndistrict of Belluno, and his modest home in the Corte dell' Cavallo near\r\nthe Misericordia. \"He lives comfortably in his quiet house,\" writes\r\nVasari, who certainly knew Bordone in Venice, \"working only at the\r\nrequest of princes, or his friends, avoiding all rivalry and those vain\r\nambitions which do but disturb the repose of man, and seeking to avert\r\nany ruffling of the serene tranquillity of his life, which he is\r\naccustomed to preserve simple and upright.\"\r\n\r\nMany of his pictures show an intense love of country solitudes. His\r\npoetic backgrounds, lonely mountains, leafy woods, and sparkling water\r\nare in curious contrast to the sumptuous groups in the foreground.\r\n\r\nHis \"Three Heads,\" in the Brera, is a superb piece of painting and\r\nan interesting characterisation. The woman is ripe, sensual, and\r\ncalculating, feeling with her fingers for the gold chain, a mere\r\ngolden-fleshed, rose-flushed hireling, solid and prosaic. The\r\ngo-between is dimly seen in the background, but the face of the suitor\r\nis a strange, ironic study: past youth, worn, joyless, and bitter,\r\ntaking his pleasure mechanically and with cynical detachment. The \"Storm\r\ncalmed by S. Mark\" (Academy) was, in Mr. Berenson's opinion, begun by\r\nGiorgione.\r\n\r\nRich, brilliant, and essentially Venetian as is the work of these\r\ntwo painters, it does not reach the highest level. It falls short of\r\ngrandeur, and has that worldly tone that borders on vulgarity. As we\r\nstudy it we feel that it marks the point to which Venetian art might\r\nhave attained, the flood-mark it might have touched, if it had lacked\r\nthe advent of the three or four great spirits, who, appearing about\r\nthe same time, bore it up to sublimer heights and developed a more\r\ndistinguished range of qualities. Bonifazio and Bordone lack the\r\ngrandeur and sweetness of Titian, the brilliant touch and imaginative\r\ngenius of Tintoretto, the matchless feeling for colour, design, and\r\ndecoration of Veronese, but they continue Venetian painting on logical\r\nlines, and they form a superb foundation for the highest.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\r\n\r\n _Bonifazio Veronese._\r\n\r\n Dresden.

The\r\nFriulan cities, Udine, Serravalle, and small neighbouring towns, had\r\ntheir own primitive schools and their scores of humble craftsmen. Their\r\nart wavered for some time in its expression between the German taste,\r\nwhich came so close to their gates, and the Italian, which was more\r\ntruly their element.\r\n\r\nUp to 1499 Friuli was invaded seven times in thirty years by the\r\nTurks. They poured in large numbers over the Bosnian borders, crossed\r\nthe Isonzo and the Tagliamenta, and massacred and carried off the\r\ninhabitants. These terrible periods are marked by the cessation of work\r\nin the provinces, but hope always revived again. The break caused by\r\nsuch a visitation can be distinctly traced in the Church of S. Antonino,\r\nat the little town of San Daniele. Martino da Udine obtained the\r\nepithet of Pellegrino da San Daniele in 1494 when he returned from an\r\nearly visit to Venice, where he had been apprenticed to Cima. He was\r\nappointed to decorate S. Antonino. His early work there is hard and\r\ncoarse, ill-drawn, the figures unwieldy and shapeless, and the colour\r\ndusky and uniform; but owing to the Turkish raid, he had to take flight,\r\nand it was many a year before the monks gained sufficient courage and\r\nsaved enough money to continue the embellishment of their church. In the\r\nmeantime, Pellegrino's years had been spent partly in Venice and partly,\r\nperhaps, in Ferrara, for the reason Raphael gave for refusing to paint a\r\n\"Bacchus\" for the Duke, was that the subject had already been painted\r\nby Pellegrino da San Daniele. When Pellegrino resumed his work, it\r\ndemonstrated that he had studied the modern Venetians and had come under\r\na finer, deeper influence. A St. George in armour suggests Giorgione's\r\nS. Liberale at Castelfranco; he specially shows an affinity with\r\nPordenone, who was his pupil and who was to become a better painter than\r\nhis old master. As Pellegrino goes on he improves consistently, and\r\nadopts the method, so peculiarly Venetian, of sacrificing form to a\r\nscheme of chiaroscuro. He even, to some extent, succeeds in his\r\ndifficult task of applying to wall painting the system which the\r\nVenetians used almost exclusively for easel pictures. He was an\r\nambitious, daring painter, and some of his church standards were for\r\nlong attributed to Giorgione. The church of San Antonino remains his\r\nchief monument; but for all his travels Pellegrino remains provincial in\r\ntype, is unlucky in his selection, cares little for precision of form,\r\nand trusts to colour for effect.\r\n\r\nThe same transition in art was taking place in other provinces. Morto da\r\nFeltre, Pennacchi, and Girolamo da Treviso have all left work of a\r\nGiorgionesque type, and some painters who went far onward, began their\r\ncareer under such minor masters. Giovanni Antonio Licinio, who takes his\r\nname from his native town of Pordenone, in Friuli, was one of these. All\r\nthe early part of his life was spent in painting frescoes in the small\r\ntowns of the Friulan provinces. At first they bear signs of the tuition\r\nof Pellegrino, but it soon becomes evident that Pordenone has learned to\r\nimitate Giorgione and Palma. Quite early, however, one of his chief\r\nfailings appears, and one which is all his own, the disparity in size\r\nbetween his various figures. The secondary personages, the Magi in a\r\nNativity, the Saints standing round an altar, are larger and more\r\nathletic in build and often more animated in action than the principal\r\nactors in the scene. What pleased Pordenone's contemporaries was his\r\ndaring perspective and his instinctive feeling for movement. He carried\r\nout great schemes in the hill-towns, till at length his reputation,\r\nwhich had long been ripe in his native province, reached Venice. In\r\n1519 he was invited to Treviso to fresco the façade of a house for one\r\nof the Raviguino family. The painter, as payment, asked fifty scudi, and\r\nTitian was called in to adjudicate, but he admired the work so much that\r\nhe hinted to Raviguino that he would be wise not to press him for a\r\nvaluation. As a direct consequence of this piece of business, Pordenone\r\nwas employed on the chapel at Treviso, in conjunction with Titian. At\r\nthis time the Assumption and the Madonna of Casa Pesaro were just\r\nfinished, and it is probable that Pordenone paid his first visit to\r\nVenice, hard by, and saw his great contemporary's work. With his\r\ncharacteristic distaste for fresco, Titian undertook the altarpiece and\r\npainted the beautiful Annunciation which still holds its place, and\r\nPordenone covered the dome with a foreshortened figure of the Eternal\r\nFather, surrounded by angels. Among the remaining frescoes in the\r\nChapel, an Adoration of the Magi and a S. Liberale are from his brush.\r\nFired by his success at Treviso, Pordenone offered his services to\r\nMantua and Cremona, but the Mantovans, accustomed to the stately and\r\nrestrained grace of Mantegna, would have nothing to say to what Crowe\r\nand Cavalcaselle call his \"large and colossal fable-painting.\" He\r\npursued his way to Cremona, and that he studied Mantegna as he passed\r\nthrough Mantua is evident from the first figures he painted in the\r\ncathedral. In Cremona every one admired him, and all the artists set to\r\nwork to imitate his energetic foreshortening, vehement movement and huge\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nPordenone, with his love for fresco, was all his life an itinerant\r\npainter. In 1521 he was back at Udine and wandered from place to\r\nplace, painting a vast distemper for the organ doors at S. Maria at\r\nSpilimbergo, the façade of the Church of Valeriano, an imposing series\r\nat Travesio, and in 1525, the \"Story of the True Cross\" at Casara. At\r\nthe last place he threw aside much of his exaggeration, and, ruined and\r\nrestored as the frescoes are, they remain among his most dignified\r\nachievements. He may be studied best of all at Piacenza, in the Church\r\nof the Madonna di Campagna, where he divides his subjects between sacred\r\nand pagan, so that we turn from a \"Flight into Egypt\" or a \"Marriage\r\nof S. Catherine,\" to the \"Rape of Europa\" or \"Venus and Adonis.\" At\r\nPiacenza he shows himself the great painter he undoubtedly is, having\r\nachieved some mastery over form, while his colour has the true Venetian\r\nquality and almost equals oils in its luscious tones and vivid hues,\r\nwhich he lowers and enriches by such enveloping shadows as only one\r\nwhose spirit was in touch with the art of Giorgione would have\r\nunderstood how to use. Very complete records remain of Pordenone's life,\r\nfull details of a quarrel with his brother over property left by his\r\nfather in 1533, and accounts of the painter's negotiations to obtain a\r\nknighthood, which he fancied would place him more on a par with Titian\r\nwhen he went to live in Venice. The coveted honour was secured, but from\r\nthis time he seems to have been very jealous of Titian and to have aimed\r\ncontinually at rivalling him. Pordenone was a punctual and rapid\r\ndecorator, and on being given the ceiling of the Sala di San Finio to\r\ndecorate in the summer of 1536, he finished the whole by March 1538. We\r\nhave seen how Titian annoyed the Signoria by his delays, how anxious\r\nthey were to transfer his commission to Pordenone, and what a narrow\r\nescape the Venetian had of losing his Broker's patent. Pordenone was\r\nengaged by the nuns of Murano to paint an Annunciation, after they had\r\nrejected one by Titian on account of its price, and though it seems\r\nhardly possible that any one could have compared the two men, yet no\r\ndoubt the pleasure of getting an altarpiece quickly and punctually and\r\nfor a moderate sum, often outweighed the honour of the possible painting\r\nby the great Titian.\r\n\r\nNo one has left so few easel-paintings as Pordenone; fresco was so much\r\nbetter suited to his particular style. The canvas of the \"Madonna of\r\nMercy\" in the Venice Academy, was painted about 1525 for a member of the\r\nhouse of Ottobono, and introduces seven members of the family. It is\r\nvery free from his colossal, exaggerated manner; the attendant saints\r\nare studied from nature, and in his journals the painter mentions that\r\nthe St. Roch is a portrait of himself. The \"S. Lorenzo enthroned,\" in\r\nthe same gallery, shows both his virtues and failings. The saints have\r\nhis enormous proportions. The Baptist is twisting round, to display the\r\nforeshortening which Pordenone particularly affects. The gestures are\r\nempty and inexpressive, but the colour is broad and fluid; there is a\r\nlarge sense of decoration in the composition, and something simple and\r\naustere about the figure of S. Lorenzo. As is so often the case with\r\nPordenone, the principal actor of the scene is smaller and more\r\nsincerely imagined than the attendant personages, who are crowded into\r\nthe foreground, where they are used to display the master's skill.\r\n\r\nPordenone died suddenly at Ferrara, where he had been summoned by its\r\nDuke to undertake one of his great schemes of decoration. He was said\r\nto have been poisoned, but though he had jealous rivals there seems no\r\nproof of the truth of the assertion, which was one very commonly made in\r\nthose days. He is interesting as being the only distinguished member of\r\nthe Venetian School whose frescoes have come down to us in any number,\r\nand as being the only one of the later masters with whom it was the\r\nchosen medium.\r\n\r\nHis kinsman, Bernardino Licinio, is represented in the National Gallery\r\nby a half-length of a young man in black, and at Hampton Court by a\r\nlarge family group and by another of three persons gathered round a\r\nspinet. His masterpiece is a Madonna and Saints in the Frari, which\r\nshows the influence of Palma. His flesh tints, striving to be rich, have\r\na hot, red look, but his works have been constantly confounded with\r\nthose of Giorgione and Paris Bordone.\r\n\r\nA long list might be given of minor artists who were industriously\r\nturning out work on similar lines to one or other of these masters:\r\nCalderari, who imitates Paris Bordone as well as Pordenone; Pomponio\r\nAmalteo, Pordenone's son-in-law, a spirited painter in fresco;\r\nFlorigerio, who practised at Udine and Padua, and of whom an altarpiece\r\nremains in the Academy; Giovanni Battista Grassi, who helped Vasari to\r\ncompile his notices of Friulan art, and many others only known by name.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the fifteenth century the revulsion against Paduan art\r\nextended as far as Brescia, and Girolamo Romanino was one of the first\r\nto acquire the trick of Venetian painting. He probably studied for a\r\ntime under Friulan painters. Pellegrino is thought to have been at\r\nBrescia or Bergamo during the Friulan disturbances of 1506-12, and\r\nabout 1510 Romanino emerges, a skilled artist in Pellegrino's Palmesque\r\nmanner. His works at this time are dark and glowing, full of warm light\r\nand deep shadow; the scene is often laid under arches, after the manner\r\nof the Vivarini and Cima; a gorgeous scheme of accessory is framed in\r\nnoble architecture.\r\n\r\nBrescia was an opulent city, second only to Milan among the towns of\r\nnorthern Italy, and Romanino obtained plenty of patronage; but in 1511\r\nthe city fell a prey to the horrors of war, was taken and lost by\r\nVenice, and in 1512 was sacked by the French. Romanino fled to Padua,\r\nwhere he found a home among the Benedictines of S. Giustina. Here he was\r\nsoon well employed on an altarpiece with life-size figures for the high\r\naltar, and a \"Last Supper\" for the refectory. It is also surmised that\r\nhe helped in the series for the Scuola del Santo, for several of which\r\nTitian in 1511 had signed a receipt, and the \"Death of St. Anthony\" is\r\npointed out as showing the Brescian characteristics of fine colour, but\r\npoor drawing.\r\n\r\nRomanino returned to Brescia when the Venetians recovered it in 1516,\r\nbut before doing so he went to Cremona and painted four subjects, which\r\nare among his most effective, in the choir of the Duomo.\r\n\r\nHe is not so daring a painter as Pordenone, from whom he sometimes\r\nborrows ideas, but he is quite a convert to the modern style of the day,\r\nsetting his groups in large spaces and using the slashed doublets, the\r\nlong hose, and plumed headgear which Giorgione had found so picturesque.\r\nRomanino is often very poor and empty, and fails most in selection and\r\nexpression at the moments when he most needs to be great, but he is\r\nsuccessful in the golden style he adopted after his closer contact\r\nwith the Venetians, and his draperies and flesh tints are extremely\r\nbrilliant. He is, indeed, inclined to be gaudy and careless in\r\nexecution, and even the fine \"Nativity\" in the National Gallery gives\r\nthe impression that size is more regarded than thought and feeling.\r\n\r\nMoretto is perhaps the only painter from the mainland who, coming within\r\nthe charmed circle of Venetian art and betraying the study of Palma and\r\nTitian and the influence of Pordenone, still keeps his own gamut of\r\ncolour, and as he goes on, gets consistently cooler and more silvery\r\nin his tones. He can only be fully studied in Brescia itself, where\r\nliterally dozens of altarpieces and wall-paintings show him in every\r\nphase. His first connection was probably with Romanino, but he reminds\r\nus at one time of Titian by his serious realism, and finished, careful\r\npainting, at another of Raphael, by the grace and sentiment of his\r\nheads, and as time goes on he foreshadows the style of Veronese. In the\r\n\"Feast in the House of Simon\" in the organ-loft of the Church of the\r\nPietà in Venice, the very name prepares us for the airy, colonnaded\r\nbuilding, with vistas of blue sky and landscape, and the costly raiment\r\nand plenishing which might have been seen at any Venetian or Brescian\r\nbanquet. In his portraits Moretto sometimes rivals Lotto. His personages\r\nare always dignified and expressive, with pale, high-bred faces, and\r\nexceedingly picturesque in dress and general arrangement. He loved to\r\npaint a great gentleman, like the Sciarra Martinengo in the National\r\nGallery, and to endow him with an air of romantic interest.\r\n\r\nOne of those who entered so closely into the spirit of the Venetian\r\nSchool that he may almost be included within it, is Savoldo. His\r\npictures are rare, and no gallery can show more than one or two\r\nexamples. The Louvre has a portrait by him of Gaston de Foix, long\r\nthought to be by Giorgione. His native town can only show one\r\naltarpiece, an \"Adoration of Shepherds,\" low in tone but intense in\r\ndusky shadow with fringes of light. He is grey and slaty in his shadows,\r\nand often rough and startling in effect, but at his best he produces\r\nvery beautiful, rich, evening harmonies; and a letter from Aretino bears\r\nwitness to the estimation in which he was held.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to say if Brescia or Vicenza has most claim to\r\nBartolommeo Montagna, the early master of Cima. Born of Brescian\r\nparents, he settled early in Vicenza, and he is by far the most\r\ndistinguished of those Vicentine painters who drank at the Venetian\r\nfount. He must have gone early to Venice and worked with the Vivarini,\r\nfor in his altarpiece in the Brera he has the vaulted porticoes in\r\nwhich Bartolommeo and Alvise Vivarini delighted. His \"Madonna enthroned\"\r\nin the gallery at Vicenza has many points of contact with that of Alvise\r\nat Berlin. Among these are the four saints, the cupola, and the raised\r\nthrone, and he is specially attracted by the groups of music-making\r\nangels; but Montagna has more moral greatness than Alvise, and his lines\r\nare stronger and more sinewy. He keeps faithful to the Alvisian feeling\r\nfor calm and sweetness, but his personages have greater weight and\r\ngravity. He essays, too, a \"Pietà\" with saints, at Monte Berico, and\r\nshows both pathos and vehemence. He has evidently seen Bellini's\r\nrendering, and attempts, if only with partial success, to contrast in\r\nthe same way the indifference of death with the contemplation and\r\nanguish of the bereaved. Hard and angular as Montagna's saints often\r\nare, they show power and austerity. His colour is brilliant and\r\nenamel-like; he does not arrive at the Venetian depth, yet his\r\naltarpieces are very grand, and once more we are struck by the greatness\r\nof even the secondary painters who drew their inspiration from Padua and\r\nVenice.\r\n\r\nAmong the other Vicentines, Giovanni Speranza and Giovanni Buonconsiglio\r\nwere imbued with characteristics of Mantegna. Speranza, in one of his\r\nfew remaining works, almost reproduces the beautiful \"Assumption\" by\r\nPizzolo, Mantegna's young fellow-student, in the Chapel of the\r\nEremitani. He employs Buonconsiglio as an assistant, and they imitate\r\nMontagna to such an extent that it is difficult to distinguish between\r\ntheir works. Buonconsiglio's \"Pietà\" in the Vicenza gallery, is\r\nreminiscent of Montagna's at Monte Berico. The types are lean and bony,\r\nthe features are almost as rugged as Dürer's, the flesh earthy and\r\ngreenish. About 1497 Buonconsiglio was studying oils with Antonello da\r\nMessina; he begins to reside in Venice, and a change comes over his\r\nmanner. His colours show a brilliancy and depth acquired by studying\r\nTitian; and then, again, his bright tints remind us of Lotto. His name\r\nwas on the register of the Venetian Guild as late as 1530.\r\n\r\nAfter Pisanello's achievement and his marked effect on early Venetian\r\nart, Veronese painting fell for a time to a very low ebb; but Mantegna's\r\ninfluence was strongly felt here, and art revived in Liberale da Verona,\r\nFalconetto, Casoto, the Morone and Girolamo dai Libri, painters\r\ndelightful in themselves, but having little connection with the\r\nschool of Venice. Francesco Bonsignori, however, shook himself free\r\nfrom the narrow circle of Veronese art, where he had for a time\r\nfollowed Liberale, and grows more like the Vicentines, Montagna and\r\nBuonconsiglio. He is careful about his drawing, but his figures, like\r\nthose of many of these provincial painters, are short, bony and vulgar,\r\nvery unlike the slender, distinguished type of the great Paduan. Under\r\nthe name of Francesco da Verona, Bonsignori works in the new palace of\r\nthe Gonzagas, and several pictures painted for Mantua are now scattered\r\nin different collections. At Verona he has left four fine altarpieces.\r\nHe went early to Venice, where he became the pupil of the Vivarini. His\r\nfaces grow soft and oval, and the very careful outlines suggest the\r\ninfluence of Bellini.\r\n\r\nGirolamo Mocetto was journeyman to Giovanni Bellini; in fact, Vasari\r\nsays that a \"Dead Christ\" in S. Francesco della Vigna, signed with\r\nBellini's name, is from Mocetto's hand. His short, broad figures have\r\nsomething of Bartolommeo Vivarini's character.\r\n\r\nFrancesco Torbido went to Venice to study with Giorgione, and we can\r\ntrace his master's manner of turning half tones into deep shades; but he\r\ndoes not really understand the Giorgionesque treatment, in which shade\r\nwas always rich and deep, but never dark, dirty and impenetrable, nor in\r\nthe lights can he produce the clear glow of Giorgione. Another Veronese,\r\nCavazzola, has left a masterpiece upon which any painter might be happy\r\nto rest his reputation; the \"Gattemalata with an Esquire\" in the Uffizi,\r\na picture noble in feeling and in execution, and one which owes a great\r\ndeal to Venetian portrait-painters.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\r\n\r\n _Pordenone._\r\n\r\n Casara.

His free and joyous temperament gave relief at a\r\nmoment when the Venetian scheme of colour threatened to become too\r\nsombre, and when Sebastian del Piombo, Pordenone, Titian himself, and\r\nabove all Tintoretto, were pushing chiaroscuro to extremes. Veronese\r\ndiscards the deepest bronzes and mulberries and crimsons and oranges,\r\nand finds his range among cream and rose and grey-greens. Titian\r\nconcentrated his colours and intensified his lights, Tintoretto\r\nsacrifices colour to vivid play of light and dark, but Veronese avoids\r\nthe dark; the generous light plays all through his scenes. He has no\r\nwish to secure strong effects but delights in soft, faded tints; old\r\nrose and _turquoise morte_. In his colour and his subjects he is a\r\npersonification of the robust, proud, joy-loving Republic, in which, as\r\nM. Yriarte says, a man produced his works as a tree produces its fruit.\r\nWe get very near him in those vast palaces and churches and villas,\r\nwhere his heroic figures expand in the azure air, against the white\r\nclouds, and yet he is one of the artists of the Renaissance about whom\r\nwe know least. Here and there, in contemporary biography, we come across\r\na mention of him and learn that he was sociable and lively, quick at\r\ntaking offence, fond of his family and anxious to do his best by them.\r\nHe was, too, very generous with his work--a great contrast in this\r\nrespect to Titian--and contracts with convents and confraternities show\r\nthat he often only stipulated for payment for bare time. Yet he was fond\r\nof personal luxury, loved rich stuffs, horses and hounds, and, says\r\nRidolfi, \"always wore velvet breeches.\"\r\n\r\nHis first masters, according to Mr. Berenson, were Badile and\r\nBrusasorci, masters of Verona, but before he was twenty, he was away\r\nworking on his own account. His first patron was Cardinal Gonzaga, who\r\nbrought several painters from Verona to Mantua; but Mantua was no longer\r\nwhat it had been in the days of Isabela d'Este, and Paolo Caliari soon\r\nreturned to his own town. Before he was twenty-three he had decorated\r\nVilla Porti, near Vicenza, in collaboration with Zelotti, a Veronese,\r\nportraying feasting gods and goddesses, framed in light architectural\r\ndesigns in monochrome. The two painters went on to other villas, mixing\r\nmortal and mythical figures in a happy, light-hearted medley.\r\n\r\nZelotti having received a commission at Vicenza, Paolo decided to seek\r\nhis fortune in Venice. The Prior of the Convent of San Sebastiano, on\r\nthe Zattere, was a Veronese, and Caliari wrote to him before arriving in\r\nVenice in 1555. Thanks to the good Prior, who played a considerable part\r\nin his destiny, he obtained a commission for a \"Coronation of the Virgin\r\nand four other Saints.\" He first painted the sacristy, but his success\r\nwas instantaneous, and many orders followed. The ceiling of the church\r\nwas devoted to the history of Esther. The whole of these paintings\r\nare marvellously well preserved, and, inset in the carved and gilt\r\nframework, make a _coup d'oeil_ of surprising beauty. They had an\r\nimmense effect. Every one was able to appreciate these joyous pictures\r\nof Venice, the loveliness of her skies, the pomp of her ceremonies, the\r\nrich Eastern stuffs and the glorious architecture of her palaces. It\r\nwas an auspicious moment for a painter of Veronese's temper; the\r\nso-called Republic, now, more than ever, an oligarchy, was at the\r\nheight of its fortunes, redecorating was going forward everywhere, the\r\nmerchant-nobility was rich and spending magnificently, the Eastern trade\r\nwas flourishing, Venice was in all her glory. The patrons Caliari came\r\nto work for, preferred the ceremonial to the imaginative treatment of\r\nsacred themes, and he does not choose the tragedies of the Bible for\r\nillustration. He paints the history of Esther, with its royal audiences,\r\nbanquets, and marriage-feasts. His Christs and Maries and Martyrs are\r\ncomposed, courtly personages, who maintain a dignified calm under\r\nmisfortune, and have very little violent feeling to show.\r\n\r\nAt the time of his arrival in Venice, Palma Vecchio was just dead,\r\nTintoretto was absorbed by the Scuola di San Rocco, Paris Bordone was\r\nwith Francis I. As rivals, Caliari had Salviati, Bonifazio, Schiavone,\r\nand Zelotti, all rendering homage to Titian who was eighty years old,\r\nbut still in full vigour. Titian's opinions in matters of art were\r\ndictates, his judgment was a law. He immediately recognised Veronese's\r\ngenius, which was of a kind to appeal to him, and together with\r\nSansovino, who at this time was Director of Buildings to the Signoria,\r\nhe received the young painter with an approval which ensured him a good\r\nstart. Five years after Veronese's arrival he was retained to decorate\r\nthe Villa Barbaro at Maser, which is a type of those patrician\r\ncountry-houses to which the Venetians were becoming more attached every\r\nyear. Daniele Barbaro, Patriarch of Aquileia, whose magnificent portrait\r\nby Veronese is in the Pitti, was himself an artist and designed the\r\nceiling of the Hall of the Council of Ten. Palladio, Alessandro\r\nVittoria, and Veronese were associated to build him a dwelling worthy of\r\na Prince of the Church. In style the villa is a total contrast to the\r\ngorgeous Venetian palaces; it is sober and simple, and well adapted to\r\nleisure and retirement. Its white stucco walls and decorations are\r\ndevoid of gilding and colour, and the rooms adorned by Veronese's brush\r\nshow him in quite a new light. His visit to Rome did not take place till\r\nfour years later, but he has been influenced here by the feeling for the\r\nantique, and he thinks much of line and style. He leaves on one side the\r\ngorgeous brocades and gleaming satins, in which he usually delights, and\r\nhis nymphs are only clothed in their own beauty. And here Veronese shows\r\nhis admirable taste and discretion; his patrons, the Barbaro family, are\r\nhis friends, men and women of the world, who put no restraint on his\r\nfancy, and are not prone to censure, and Veronese, with the bridle on\r\nhis neck, so to speak, uses his opportunities fully, yet never exceeds\r\nthe limits of good taste. He is not gross and sensual like Rubens, but\r\nproud, grave and sweet, seductive, but never suggestive or vulgar. After\r\nhaving placed single figures wherever he can find a nook, he assembles\r\nall the gods of Olympia at a supper in the cupola. Immortality is a\r\nbeautiful young woman seated on a cloud. Mercury gazes at her, caduceus\r\nin hand; Diana caresses her great hound; Saturn, an old man, rests his\r\nhead on his hand; Mars, Apollo, Venus, and a little cupid are scattered\r\nin the Empyrean, and Jupiter presides over the party. Below, a balcony\r\nrail runs round the cupola, and looking over it, an old lady, dressed in\r\nthe latest fashion, points out the company to a beautiful young one and\r\nto a young man in a doublet who holds a hound in a leash. They are\r\nevidently family portraits, taken from those who looked on at the\r\nartist, and on the other side he has introduced members of his own\r\nfamily who were helping him. These decorations have a gaiety, an\r\nabsence of pedantry, a sound and sane sympathy with the spirit of the\r\nRenaissance which tell of a happy moment when art was at its height and\r\nin touch with its environment. From about 1563 we may begin to date his\r\ngreat supper pictures. The Marriage of Cana (Louvre), one of his most\r\nfamous works, was painted for the refectory in Sammichele, the old part\r\nof S. Giorgio Maggiore. The treaty for it is still in existence, dated\r\nJune 1562. The artist asks for a year; the Prior is to furnish canvas\r\nand colours, the painter's board, and a cask of wine. The further\r\npayment of 972 ducats illustrates the prices received by the greatest\r\nartists at the height of the Renaissance: £280 for work which occupied\r\nquite eight months.\r\n\r\nVeronese must have delighted in painting this work. Needless to say, it\r\nis not in the least religious. He has united in it all the most varied\r\npersonages who struck his imagination. So we see a Spanish grandee,\r\nFrancis I., Suleiman the Sultan, Charles V., Vittoria Colonna, and\r\nEleanor of Austria. In the foreground, grouped round a table, are\r\nVeronese himself, playing the viol, Tintoretto accompanying him, Jacopo\r\nda Ponte seated by them, and Paolo's brother, the architect, with his\r\nhand on his hip, tossing off a full glass; and in the governor of the\r\nfeast, opulent and gorgeously attired, we recognise Aretino. Under\r\nthe marble columns of a Grimani or a Pesaro, he brings in all the\r\nillustrious actors of his own time and leaves us an odd and informing\r\ndocument. We can but accept the scene and admire the originality of its\r\ndesign and the freedom of its execution, its boldness and fancy, the way\r\nin which the varied incidents are brought into harmony, and the grace of\r\nthe colonnade, peopled with spectators, standing out against the depth\r\nof distant sky.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated suppers, of which this is the first example, are\r\ndispersed in different galleries and some have disappeared, but from\r\nthis time Veronese loved to paint these great displays, repeating some\r\nof them, but always introducing variety.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Paolo Veronese._\r\n                 MARRIAGE IN CANA.\r\n                _Louvre._\r\n                 (_Photo, Mansell and Co._)]\r\n\r\nIn 1564 he accompanied Girolamo Grimani, procurator of St. Mark's, who\r\nwas appointed ambassador to the Holy See, and for the first time saw the\r\nworks of Raphael and Michelangelo and the treasures of antiquity. For\r\na time, the sight of the antique had some effect upon his work; in his\r\nfamous ceiling in the Louvre, \"Jupiter destroying the Vices,\" the\r\ninfluence of Michelangelo is apparent and its large gestures are\r\ninspired by sculpture. Ridolfi says that Veronese brought home casts\r\nfrom Rome, and statues of Amazons and the Laocoon seem to have inspired\r\nthe Jupiter. He did not go on long in this path; he does not really care\r\nfor the nude--it is too simple for him. He prefers that his saints and\r\ndivinities should appear in the gorgeous costumes of the day, and that\r\nhis Venus and Diana and the nymphs should trail in rich brocades. But\r\nfew documents are left concerning his work for the Ducal Palace up to\r\n1576; much of it was destroyed in the great fire, but the Signoria then\r\ngave him a number of fresh commissions. The most important was the\r\nimmense oval of the \"Triumph of Venice,\" or, as it is sometimes called,\r\nthe \"Thanksgiving for Lepanto\"; the Republic crowned by victory and\r\nsurrounded by allegorical figures, Glory, Peace, Happiness, Ceres, Juno\r\nand the rest. The composition shows the utmost freedom: the fair Queen\r\nleans back, surrounded by laughing patricians, who look up from their\r\nbalconies, as if they were attending a regatta on the Grand Canal. The\r\nhorses of the Free Companions, the soldiers who go afar to carry out the\r\nwill of the Republic, prance in a crowd of personages, each of whom\r\nrepresents a town or colony of her domain. Like all Veronese's\r\ncreations, this will always be pre-eminently a picture of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, dated by a thousand details of costume, architecture, and\r\narmour. Venice, the Venice of Lepanto and the Venier, of Titian,\r\nAretino, and Veronese himself, makes a deep impression upon us, and\r\nthe artist reflects his age with sympathetic spontaneity.\r\n\r\nHardly a hall of the Ducal Palace but can show a canvas of Veronese or\r\nthe assistants by whom he was now surrounded. From time to time he\r\nresumed the decorations of S. Sebastiano, and his incessant production\r\nbetrays no trace of fatigue or languor. The martyrdom of the saint is a\r\ntriumph of the beauty of the silhouette against a radiant sky. He goes\r\nback to Verona and paints the \"Martyrdom of St. George.\" He pours light\r\ninto it. The saints open a shining path, down which a flower-crowned\r\nLove flutters with the diadem and palm of victory. The whole air and\r\nexpression of St. George is full of strength and that look of goodness\r\nand serenity which is the painter's nearest approach to religious\r\nfeeling. Veronese was created a Chevalier of St. Mark; every one was\r\nasking for his services, but he was a stay-at-home by nature and fond of\r\nliving with his family. Philip II. longed to get him to cover his great\r\nwalls in the Escurial, but he very civilly declined all his invitations\r\nand sent Federigo Zucchero in his stead.\r\n\r\nIt was on account of the \"Feast in the House of Levi\" that in 1573 he\r\nwas hauled before the tribunal of the Inquisition, and the document\r\nconcerning this was only discovered a few years ago. The Signoria had\r\nnever allowed any tribunal to chastise works of literature; on the\r\ncontrary, Venice, though comparatively poor herself in geniuses of the\r\nmind, was the refuge of freedom of thought, and, in fact, had made a\r\nsort of compact with Niccolas V., which allowed her to set aside or\r\nsuspend the decisions of the Holy Office, from which she could not quite\r\nemancipate herself. Veronese, however, was denounced by some \"aggrieved\r\nperson,\" to whom his way of treating sacred subjects seemed an outrage\r\non religion. The members of the tribunal demanded \"who the boy was with\r\nthe bleeding nose?\" and \"why were halberdiers admitted?\" Veronese\r\nreplied that they were the sort of servants a rich and magnificent host\r\nwould have about him. He was then asked why he had introduced the\r\nbuffoon with a parrot on his hand. He replied that he really thought\r\nonly Christ and His Apostles were present, but that when he had a little\r\nspace over, he adorned it with imaginary figures. This defence of the\r\nvast and crowded canvas did not commend itself, and he was asked if he\r\nreally thought that at the Last Supper of our Saviour it was fitting to\r\nbring in dwarfs, buffoons, drunken Germans, and other absurdities. Did\r\nhe not know that in Germany and other places infested with heresy, they\r\nwere in the habit of turning the things of Holy Church into ridicule,\r\nwith intent to teach false doctrine to the ignorant? Paolo for his\r\ndefence cited the Last Judgment, where Michelangelo had painted every\r\nfigure in the nude, but the Inquisitor replied crushingly, that these\r\nwere disembodied spirits, who could not be expected to wear clothing.\r\nCould Veronese uphold his picture as decent? The painter was probably\r\nnot very much alarmed. He was a person of great importance in Venice,\r\nand the proceedings of the Inquisition were always jealously watched\r\nby members of the Senate, who would not have permitted any unfair\r\ninterference with the liberties of those under the protection of the\r\nState. The real offence was the introduction of the German soldiers, who\r\nwere peculiarly obnoxious to the Venetians; but Veronese did not care\r\nwhat the subject was as long as it gave him an excuse for a great\r\n_spectacle_. Brought to bay, he gave the true answer: \"My Lords, I have\r\nnot considered all this. I was far from wishing to picture anything\r\ndisorderly. I painted the picture as it seemed best to me and as my\r\nintellect could conceive of it.\" It meant that Veronese painted in the\r\nway that he considered most artistic, without even remembering questions\r\nof religion, and in this he summed up his whole æsthetic creed. He was\r\nset at liberty on condition that he took out one or two of the most\r\noffending figures. The \"Feast in the House of Levi\" (as he named it\r\nafter the trial) is the finest of all his great scenic effects. The air\r\ncirculates freely through the white architecture, we breathe more deeply\r\nas we look out into the wide blue sky, and such is the sensation of\r\nexpansion, that it is hardly possible to believe we are gazing at a flat\r\nwall. Titian's backgrounds are a blue horizon, a burning twilight.\r\nVeronese builds marble palaces, with rosy shadows, or columns blanched\r\nin the liquid light. His personages show little violent action. He\r\nplaces them in noble poses in which they can best show off their\r\nmagnificent clothes, and he endows his patricians, his goddesses, his\r\nsacred persons, with a uniform air of majestic indolence.\r\n\r\nAfter his \"trial,\" Veronese proceeded more triumphantly than ever. Every\r\nprince wished to have something from his brush; the Emperor Rudolph, at\r\nPrague, showed with pride the canvases taken later by Gustavus Adolphus.\r\nThe Duke of Modena, carrying on the traditions of Ferrara, added\r\nVeronese's works to the treasures of the house of Este. The last ten\r\nyears of his life were given up to visiting churches on the mainland and\r\non the little islands round Venice, all covetous to possess something by\r\nthe brilliant Veronese, whose name was in every mouth. Torcello, Murano,\r\nTreviso, Castelfranco, every convent and monastery loaded him with\r\ncommissions, and it is significant of the spirit of the time, that in\r\nspite of the disapproval of the Holy See, his most ardent patrons, those\r\nwho delighted most in his robust, uncompromising worldliness, were to be\r\nfound in the religious houses. Then, when he went to rest in the summer\r\nheats in some villa on the Brenta, he left delightful souvenirs here and\r\nthere. It was on such an occasion, for the Pisani, that he painted the\r\n\"Family of Darius,\" which was sold to England by a member of the house\r\nin 1857. The royal captives, who are throwing themselves at the feet of\r\nthe conqueror, are, with Paolo's usual frank naïveté and disregard of\r\nanachronisms, dressed in full Venetian costume--all the chief personages\r\nare portraits of the Pisani family. The freedom and rapidity of\r\nexecution, the completeness and finish, the charm of colour, the\r\nbeauty of the figures (especially the princely ones of Alexander and\r\nHephaestion), and its extraordinary energy, make this one of the finest\r\nof all his works. The critic, Charles Blanc, says of it, \"It is absurd\r\nand dazzling.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Rape of Europa,\" he recurred again to one of those legends of\r\nfabled beings who have outlasted dynasties and are still fresh and\r\nliving. Veronese was surrounded by men like Aretino and Bembo, well\r\nversed in mythology, and with his usual zest he makes the tale an excuse\r\nfor painting lovely, blooming women, rich toilets, and a delightful\r\nlandscape. The wild flowers spring, and the little Loves fly to and fro\r\nagainst a cloud-flecked sky of the wonderful Veronese turquoise. It is\r\nthe work of a man who is a true poet of colour and for whom colour\r\nrepresents all the emotions of joy and pleasure.\r\n\r\nVeronese died comparatively young, of chill and fever, and all his\r\nfamily survived him. He lies buried in San Sebastiano. From contemporary\r\nmemoirs we know that he lived and dressed splendidly. He kept immense\r\nstores of gorgeous stuffs to paint from in his studio, and drew\r\neverything from life,--the negroes covered with jewels, the bright-eyed\r\npages, the models who, robed in velvets, brocades and satins, became\r\nqueens or courtesans or saints. The pearls which bedecked them were from\r\nhis own caskets. Though we know little of his private life, his work is\r\nso alive that he seems personified in it. He is saved from what might\r\nhave been a prosaic or a sordid style by the delicious, ever-changing\r\ncolour in which he revels; his silks and satins are less modelled by\r\nshadows than tinted by broken reflections, his embroidered and striped\r\nand arabesqued tissues are so harmoniously combined that the eye rests,\r\nwherever it falls, on something exquisite and subtle in tint. This is\r\nwhere his genius lies, \"the decoration does not add to the interest of\r\nthe drama; it replaces it\"; in short, it _is_ the drama itself, for his\r\ntypes show little selection, and his ideal of female beauty is not a\r\nvery sympathetic one. His personages are cold and devoid of expression,\r\ntheir gestures are rather meaningless, but by means of light and air and\r\nexquisite colour he gives the poetical touch which all great art\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\nOn account of their size few examples of Veronese's work are to be found\r\nin private collections, but the galleries of the different European\r\ncapitals are rich in them. Numbers of paintings, too, which are by his\r\nassistants are dignified by his name, and directly after his death\r\nspurious works were freely manufactured and sold as genuine.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\r\n\r\n Dresden.

It was an open and above-board one, and there is\r\npractically no time during its span that we are not able to account for,\r\nand to say where he was living and how he was occupied. The son of a\r\ndyer, a member of one of the powerful guilds of Venice, the \"little\r\ndyer,\" _il tentoretto_, appears as an enthusiastic boy, keen to learn\r\nhis chosen art. He was apprenticed to Titian and, immediately after,\r\nsummarily ejected from that master's workshop, on account, it seems\r\nprobable, of the independence and innovation of his style, which was\r\nof the very kind most likely to shock and puzzle Titian's courtly,\r\nsettled genius. After this he painted when and where he could, pursuing\r\nhis artistic studies with the headlong ardour which through life\r\ncharacterised his attitude towards art. Mr. Berenson thinks he may have\r\nworked in Bonifazio's studio. He formed a close friendship with Andrea\r\nSchiavone,[4] he imported casts of Michelangelo's statues, he studied\r\nthe works of Titian and Palma. Over his door was written \"the colour of\r\nTitian and the form of Michelangelo.\" All his energies were for long\r\ndevoted to the effort to master that form. Colour came to him naturally,\r\nbut good drawing meant more to him than it had ever done to any\r\nVenetian. Long afterwards, to repeated inquiries as to how excellence\r\ncould be best ensured, he would give no other advice than the\r\nreiterated, \"study drawing.\" He practised till the human form in every\r\nattitude held no difficulties for him. He suspended little models by\r\nstrings, and drew every limb and torso he could get hold of over and\r\nover again. He was found in every place where painting was wanted,\r\ngetting the builders to let him experiment upon the house-fronts. To\r\nmaster light and shade he constructed little cardboard houses, in which,\r\nby means of sliding shutters, lamplight and skylight effects could be\r\narranged. It is particularly interesting to hear of this part of his\r\neducation, as in the end the love of shine and shadow was the most\r\nvictorious of all his inspirations.\r\n\r\n [4] Andrea Meldola, the Sclavonian, a native of Dalmatia,\r\n landing in Venice, had a great struggle for existence. He drew from\r\n Parmegianino, and studied Giorgione and Titian. He was probably an\r\n assistant of Titian, and helped him, as in the \"Venus and Adonis\" of the\r\n National Gallery, which owes much to his hand. He fails conspicuously in\r\n form, his shadows are black, and his figures often vulgar, but he has a\r\n fine sense of colour, and a free, crisp touch. He was one of the young\r\n masters who flooded Venice with light, sketchy wares.\r\n\r\nThe chief events in Tintoretto's life are art-events. For some years he\r\nfrescoed the outside of houses at a nominal price, or merely for his\r\nexpenses. He decorated household furniture and everything he could\r\nlay hands on. Then came a few small commissions, an altarpiece here,\r\norgan-doors there, for unimportant churches. No one in Venice talked\r\nof any one save Palma, Bonifazio, and, above all, Titian, and it was\r\ndifficult enough for an outsider, who was not one of their clique, to\r\nget employment. But by the time Tintoretto was twenty-six his talent was\r\nbecoming recognised; he had painted the two altarpieces for SS. Ermagora\r\nand Fortunato, and the offer he made to decorate the vast church of his\r\nparish brought him conspicuously into notice. In the first ardour of\r\nyouth he completed the \"Last Judgment\" for the choir. From time to time,\r\nduring fourteen years, he redeemed his early promises and executed the\r\n\"Golden Calf\" and the \"Presentation of the Virgin.\" Within two years of\r\nhis offer to the Prior, came his first great opportunity of achieving\r\ndistinction. This was a commission from the Confraternity of St. Mark,\r\nand with the \"Miracle of the Slave\" he sprang at once to the highest\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe picture was universally admired, and was followed by three more\r\ndealing with the patron saint. At forty he married happily a beautiful\r\nyoung girl, Faustina dei Vescovi, or Episcopi, as it is indifferently\r\ngiven, the daughter of a noble family of the mainland. Tradition has\r\nalways pointed to the girl in blue in the \"Golden Calf\" as her portrait,\r\nwhile it is easy to recognise Tintoretto himself in the black-bearded\r\ngiant, who helps to carry the idol. His house at this time was somewhere\r\nin the Parrocchia dell' Orto, and there, during the next fourteen years,\r\neight children were born, of whom the two eldest, Domenico and Marietta,\r\nattained distinction in their father's profession. Another great\r\nevent, which profoundly influenced his life, was the beginning of his\r\nconnection in 1560 with the Scuola di San Rocco, the great confraternity\r\nwhich was devoted to combating the ravages of the plague and to\r\nsuccouring the families of its victims. His work for this lasted to the\r\nend of his life and is his most distinguished memorial.\r\n\r\nThe palace to which the Robusti family moved in 1574, and which was\r\ninhabited by his descendants so late as 1830, can still be identified in\r\nthe Calle della Sensa. It is broken up into two parts, but it is evident\r\nthat it was a dwelling of some importance, a good specimen of Venetian\r\nGothic. It still bears marks of considerable decoration; the walls are\r\nsheathed in marble plaques, and the first floor has rows of Gothic\r\nwindows in delicately carved frames and little balconies of fretted\r\nmarble. Zanetti, in 1771, gives an etching of a magnificent bronze\r\nfrieze cast from the master's design, which ran round the Grand Sala.\r\nThe family must have occupied the _piano nobile_ and let off the floors\r\nthey did not require.\r\n\r\nDescriptions of the life led by the painter and his family are given\r\nby Vasari, who knew him personally, and by Ridolfi, whose book was\r\npublished in 1646, and who must have known his children, several of whom\r\nwere still alive and proud of their father's fame. We hear of pleasant\r\nevenings spent in the little palace, of the enthusiastic love of music,\r\nTintoretto himself and his daughter being highly gifted. Among the\r\n_habitués_ were Zarlino, for twenty-five years chapel-master of St.\r\nMark's, one of the fathers of modern music; Bassano; and Veronese, who,\r\nin spite of his love for magnificent entertainments, was often to be\r\nfound in Tintoretto's pleasant home. Poor Andrea Schiavone was always\r\nwelcome, and as time went on the house became the haunt of all the\r\ncultured gentlemen and _litterati_ of Venice.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult from the materials available to form a sufficiently\r\nlively idea of this Venetian citizen of the sixteenth century, as father\r\nand husband, host and painter. Ridolfi has collected a number of\r\nanecdotes, which space forbids me to use, but which are all very\r\ncharacteristic. We gather that he was a man of strong character,\r\ngenerous, sincere and simple, decided in his ways, caring little for\r\nthe great world, but open-handed and hospitable under his own roof,\r\nobservant of men and manners, and sometimes rather brusque in dealing\r\nwith bores and offensive persons. Full of dry quiet humour and of\r\ngood-natured banter of his wife's little weaknesses. A man, too, of\r\nupright conduct and free, as far as it can be ascertained, from any of\r\nthose laxities and infidelities, so freely quoted of celebrated men and\r\nso easily condoned by his age. Art was Tintoretto's main preoccupation;\r\nbut he seems to have been a man of strong religious bias, making a close\r\nstudy of the Bible, and turning naturally in his last days to those\r\ntruths with which his art had made him familiar, truths which he had\r\nrepresented with that touch of mystic feeling which was the deepest part\r\nof his nature.\r\n\r\nHis relations with the State commenced in 1574, when his offer to\r\npresent a superb painting of the Victory of Lepanto was made to and\r\naccepted by the Council of Ten. Tintoretto was rewarded by a Broker's\r\npatent, and between this and the \"Paradiso,\" the work of his old age, he\r\nexecuted a number of pictures for the Signoria. The only record of any\r\ntravels are confined to two journeys paid to Mantua, where he went in\r\nthe 'sixties and again in 1579 to see to the hanging of paintings done\r\nfor the Gonzaga, and of which the documents have been kept, though the\r\npictures have vanished. Tintoretto's last years were saddened by the\r\ndeath of his beloved daughter, who had always been his constant\r\ncompanion. He died in 1579 after a fortnight's illness and left a will,\r\nwhich, together with that of his son, throws a good deal of light upon\r\nthe family history.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to select from the vast quantity of work left by\r\nTintoretto. He is one of those painters whose whole life was passed in\r\nhis native city and who can only be adequately studied in that city.\r\nPerhaps the first place in which to seek him, is the great church which\r\nwas the monument of his early prime. The \"Last Judgment\" was probably\r\ninspired by that of Michelangelo, of which descriptions and sketches\r\nmust have reached the younger master, over whom the Florentine had\r\nexercised so strong a fascination. Tintoretto's version impresses one as\r\nthat of a mind boiling with thoughts and visions which he pours out upon\r\nthe huge space. It depicts a terrible catastrophe, a scene of rushing\r\ndestruction, of forms swept into oblivion, of others struggling to the\r\nlight, of many beautiful figures and of a flood of air and light behind\r\nthe rushing water,--water which makes us almost giddy as we watch it.\r\nThe \"Golden Calf\" is a maturer production and includes some of the\r\nloveliest women Tintoretto ever painted. We see too plainly the\r\nplanning, the device of concentrating interest on the idol by turning\r\nfigures and pointing fingers, but nothing can be imagined more supple\r\nand queenly than the woman in blue, and the way the light falls on her\r\nhead and perfectly foreshortened arm shows to what excellence Tintoretto\r\nhad attained. The \"Presentation\" is a riper work. The drawing of the\r\nflight of steps and of the groups upon them could not be bettered. The\r\nlittle figure of the Virgin, prototype of the new dispensation, as she\r\nadvances to meet the representative of the old, thrills with mystic\r\nfeeling, yet the painter has contrived to retain the sturdy simplicity\r\nof a child. The \"St. Agnes,\" with its contrast of light and shade, of\r\nstrength made perfect in weakness, is of later date and was the\r\ncommission of Cardinal Contarini.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to realise how Tintoretto, especially in the\r\n\"Presentation,\" has contrived, while using the traditional episodes, to\r\ninfuse so strong an imaginative sense. The contrast of age and youth,\r\nthe joy of the Gentiles, the starlike figure of the child surrounded by\r\nshadows, convey an emotional feeling, in harmony with the nature of the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nNext let us group together the miracles in the history of St. Mark. One\r\nof the qualities which strikes us most in the \"Miracle of the Slave\" is\r\nits strong local colour. It tells of Titian and Bonifazio and is unlike\r\nTintoretto's later style. The colours are glowing and gem-like;\r\ncarnations, orange-yellows, deep scarlet, and turquoise-blue. The\r\ncrimson velvet of the judge's dress is finely relieved against a\r\nblue-green sky, and Tintoretto has kept that instinctive fire and dash\r\nwhich culminates at once and without effort in perfect action, \"as a\r\nbird flies, or a horse gallops.\" It startled the quiet members of the\r\nGuild, and at the first moment they hesitated to accept it. The \"Rescue\r\nof the Saracen\" and the \"Transportation of the Body\" are more in the\r\ngolden-brown manner to which he was moving, but it is in the \"Finding\r\nof the Body\" (Brera) that he rises to the highest emotional pitch. The\r\ncolossal form of the saint, expanding with life and power as he towers\r\nin the spirit above his own lifeless clay, draws all eyes to him and\r\nseems to fill the barrel-roofed hall with ease and energy. Every part of\r\nthe vault is flooded by his life-giving energy, and here Tintoretto\r\ndeals with light and shade with full mastery.\r\n\r\nAs we follow Tintoretto's career, it is borne in upon us how little\r\npositive colour it takes to make a great colourist. The whole Venetian\r\nSchool, indeed, does not deal with what we understand as bright colour.\r\nVivid tints are much more characteristic of the Flemish and the\r\nFlorentine, or, let us say, of the painters of to-day. Strong, crude\r\ncolours are to be seen on all sides in the Salon or the Royal Academy,\r\nbut they are absent from the scheme of sombre splendour which has\r\ngiven the Venetians their title to fame. This is especially true of\r\nTintoretto, and it becomes more so as he advances. His gamut becomes\r\nmore golden-brown and mellow; the greys and browns and ivories combine\r\nin a lustrous symphony more impressive than gay tints, flooded with\r\nenveloping shadow and illumined by flashes of iridescent light. Another\r\nnoticeable feature is the way in which he puts on his oil-colour, so\r\nthat it bears the direct impression of the painter's hand. The\r\nFlorentines had used flat tints, opaque and with every brush-mark\r\nsmoothed away; but as the later Venetians covered large spaces with\r\noil-colour, they no longer sought to dissimulate the traces of the\r\nbrush, and light, distance, movement, were all conveyed by the turns and\r\ntwists and swirls with which the thin oil-colour was laid on. Look at\r\nthe power of touch in such a picture as the \"Death of Abel\"; we see this\r\nspontaneity of execution actually forming part of the emotion with which\r\nthe picture is charged. The concentrated hate of the one figure, the\r\ndesperate appeal of the other, the lurid note of the landscape, gain\r\ntheir emotion as much from the impetuous brush-work as from the more\r\nstudied design. We come closest to the painter's mind in the Scuola\r\ndi San Rocco. He had already been employed in the church, and there\r\nremains, darkened and ruined by damp, the series illustrative of the\r\ncareer of S. Roch, patron saint of sufferers from the plague. When the\r\ngreat Halls of Assembly were to be decorated in 1560, the confraternity\r\nasked a conclave of painters, among whom were Veronese and Andrea\r\nSchiavone, to prepare sketches for competition. When they assembled to\r\ndisplay their designs, Tintoretto swept aside a cartoon from the ceiling\r\nof the refectory and discovered a finished picture, the \"S. Roch in\r\nGlory,\" which still holds its place there. Neither the other artists nor\r\nthe brethren seem to have approved of this unconventional proceeding,\r\nbut he \"hoped they would not be offended; it was the only way he knew.\"\r\nPartly from the displeased withdrawal of some of the rest, but partly\r\nalso from the excellence of the work, the commission fell to Tintoretto,\r\nand after two years' work he was received into the order, and was\r\nassigned an annual provision of 100 ducats (£50) a year for life, being\r\nbound every year to furnish three pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTINTORETTO (_continued_)\r\n\r\nThe first portion of the vast building that was finished was the\r\nRefectory, but in examining the scheme, it is perhaps more convenient to\r\nleave it to its proper place, which is the climax. Before beginning,\r\nTintoretto must have had the whole thing planned, and we cannot doubt\r\nthat he was influenced by the Sixtine Chapel and recalled its plan and\r\nsignificance; the old dispensation typifying the new, the Old Testament\r\nhistory vivified by the acts of Christ. The main feature of the harmony\r\nwhich it is only reasonable to suppose governs the whole building, is\r\nits dedication to S. Roch, the special patron of mercy. The principal\r\npaintings of the Upper Hall are therefore concerned with acts of divine\r\nmercy and deliverance, and even the monochromes bear upon the central\r\nidea. On the roof are the three most important miracles of mercy\r\nperformed on behalf of the Chosen People. The paintings on roof and\r\nwalls are linked together. The \"Fall of Man\" at one end of the Hall,\r\nthe disobedient eating, corresponds with the obedient eating of the\r\nPassover at the other, and is interdependent with the Manna in the\r\nWilderness, the Last Supper, and the Miracle of the Loaves. The Miracles\r\nof satisfied thirst are represented by \"Moses striking the Rock,\" Samson\r\ndrinking from the jawbone and the waters of Meribah. The Baptism and\r\nother signs of the Advent of Christ and the Divine preparation, balance\r\nevents in the early life of Moses. In the Refectory which opens from the\r\nGreat Hall, we come to the \"Crucifixion,\" the crowning act of mercy,\r\nsurrounded by the events which immediately succeeded it, and typified\r\nimmediately above in the Central Hall, by the lifting up of the Brazen\r\nSerpent. The miracles include six of refreshment and succour, two of\r\nmiraculous restoration to health, and two of deliverance from danger.\r\nThe whole scheme has been worked out in detail in my book on\r\n\"Tintoretto.\"\r\n\r\nIn the working out of his great scheme, Tintoretto is impatient of\r\nhackneyed and traditional forms; he must have a reading of his own, and\r\none which appeals to his imagination. We see that passion for movement\r\nwhich distinguishes his early work. \"Moses striking the Rock\" is a\r\nfigure instinct with purpose and energy. The water bounds forth, living,\r\nlife-giving, the people strain wildly to reach it. His figures are\r\nsometimes found fault with, as extravagant in gesture, but the attitudes\r\nwere intended to be seen and to arrest attention from far below, and we\r\nmust not forget that the painter's models were drawn from a Southern\r\nrace, to whom emphasis of action is natural. Tintoretto, it may be\r\nconceded, is on certain occasions, generally when dealing with accessory\r\nfigures, inclined to excess of gesture; it is the defect of his\r\ntemperament, but when he has a subject that carries him away he is\r\nsincere and never violent in spirit. Titian is cold compared to him; his\r\ncolour, however effective, is calculated, whereas Tintoretto's seems to\r\npermeate every object and to soak the whole composition. To quote a\r\nrecent critic: \"He chose to begin, if possible, with a subject charged\r\nwith emotion. He then proceeded to treat it according to its nature,\r\nthat is to say, he toned down and obscured the outlines of form and\r\nmapped out the subject instead in pale or sombre masses of light and\r\nshade. Under the control of this powerful scheme of chiaroscuro, the\r\ncolouring of the composition was placed, but its own character, its\r\ndegree of richness and sobriety, was determined by the kind of emotion\r\nbelonging to the subject. To use colour in this way, not only with\r\nemotional force, but with emotional truth, is to use it to perform one\r\nof the greatest functions of art.\"[5]\r\n\r\n [5] \"Venice and the Renaissance,\" _Edinburgh Review_, 1909.\r\n\r\nSo in the Crucifixion it is not so much the aspect of the groups, the\r\npathos of the faces or gestures, that tells, but it is the mystery and\r\ngloom in which the whole scene is muffled, the atmosphere into which we\r\nare absorbed, the sense of livid terror conveyed by the brooding light\r\nand shadow, that makes us feel how different the rendering is from any\r\nother. In the \"Christ before Pilate\" the head and figure of Christ are\r\nnot particularly impressive in themselves, but the brilliant light\r\nfalling on the white robes and coursing down the steps supplies dignity\r\nand poetry; the slender white figure stands out like a shaft of light\r\nagainst the lurid and troubled background. Again, in the \"Way to\r\nGolgotha\" the falling evening gleam, the wild sky, the deep shadow of\r\nthe ravine, throw into relief the quiet form, detached in look and\r\nfeeling, as of one upborne by the spirit far above the brutal throng.\r\nNowhere does that spiritual emotion find deeper expression than in the\r\n\"Visitation.\" The passion of thanksgiving, the poignancy of mother-love,\r\nthrob through the two women, who have been travelling towards one\r\nanother, with a great secret between them, and who at length reach the\r\nhaven of each other's love and knowledge. Here, too, the dying light,\r\nthe waving tree, the obliteration of form, and the feeling of mystery\r\nmake a deep appeal to the sensuous apprehension. We find it again and\r\nagain; the great trees sway and whisper in the gathering darkness as the\r\nVirgin rides through the falling evening shadows, clasping her Babe, and\r\nin that most moving of all Tintoretto's creations, the \"S. Mary of\r\nEgypt,\" the emotional mood of Nature's self is brought home to us. The\r\ntrees that dominate the landscape are painted with a few \"strokes like\r\nsabre cuts\"; the landscape, given with apparent carelessness, yet\r\nconveying an indescribable sense of space and solemnity, unfolds itself\r\nunder the dying day; and in solitary meditation, thrilling with ecstasy,\r\nsits that little figure, whose heart has travelled far away to commune\r\nwith the Spirit, \"whose dwelling is the light of setting suns.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not possible in a short space to touch, even in passing, on all\r\nthe many scenes in these halls: the \"Annunciation,\" with its marvellous\r\nflight of cherubs, reminding us of the flight of pigeons in the Piazza,\r\nand how often the old painter must have watched them; the \"Temptation,\"\r\ncontrasting the throbbing evil, the flesh that _must_ be fed, with the\r\ncalm of absolute purity; the \"Massacre of the Innocents,\" for which the\r\nhorrors of sacked towns could have supplied many a parallel,--we have\r\nnot time to dwell on these, but we may notice how the artist has\r\novercome the difficulty of seeing clearly in the dark halls, by choosing\r\nstrong and varied effects of light for the most shadowed spaces, and we\r\ncan picture what the halls must have been like when they first glowed\r\nfrom his hand, adorned with gilded fretwork and moulding, and hung with\r\nopulent draperies, with the rose-red and purple of bishops' and\r\ncardinals' robes reflected in the gleaming pavement.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Tintoretto._     _Scuola di San Rocco._\r\n                 S. MARY OF EGYPT.\r\n                 (_Photo, Anderson._)]\r\n\r\nLeonardo, by one supreme example, Tintoretto, by many renderings, have\r\nmade the \"Last Supper\" peculiarly their own in the domain of art. It\r\nshows how strongly the mystic strain entered into the man's character,\r\nthat often as Tintoretto treated the subject, it never lost its interest\r\nfor him, and he never failed to find a fresh point of view. In that\r\nin S. Polo, Christ offers the sacred food with a gesture of vehement\r\ngenerosity. Placed as the picture is, to appeal to all comers to the\r\nMass, to afford them a welcome as they pass to the High Altar, it tells\r\nof the Bread of Life given to all mankind. Tintoretto himself, painted\r\nin the character of S. Paul, stands at one side, absorbed in meditation.\r\nWe need not insist again on the emotional value of the deep colours, the\r\nrich creams and crimsons and the chiaroscuro. In his latest rendering,\r\nin S. Giorgio Maggiore, he touches his highest point in symbolical\r\ntreatment. Some people are only able to see a theatrical, artificial\r\nspirit in this picture, but at least, when we consider what deep\r\nmeditation Tintoretto had bestowed on his subjects, we may believe that\r\nhe himself was sincere and that he let himself go over what commended\r\nitself as an entirely new rendering. \"The Light shined in the Darkness,\r\nand the Darkness comprehended it not.\" The supernatural is entering on\r\nevery side, but the feast goes on; the serving men and maids busy\r\nthemselves with the dishes; the disciples are inquiring, but not\r\nagitated; none see that throng of heavenly visitants, pouring in through\r\nthe blue moonlight, called to their Master's side by the supreme\r\nsignificance of His words. The painter has taken full advantage of the\r\nopportunity of combining the light of the cresset lamp, pouring out\r\nsmoky clouds, with the struggling moonlight and the unearthly radiance,\r\nin divers, yet mingling streams which fight against the surrounding\r\ngloom. In the scene in the Scuola di S. Rocco the betrayal is the\r\ndominating incident, and in San Stefano all is peace, and the Saviour\r\nis alone with the faithful disciples.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Tintoretto._\r\n                 BACCHUS AND ARIADNE.\r\n                _Ducal Palace, Venice._\r\n                 (_Photo, Anderson._)]\r\n\r\nThough several of the large compositions ascribed to Tintoretto in\r\nthe Ducal Palace are only partly by him, or entirely by followers and\r\nimitators, its halls are still a storehouse of his genius. There is much\r\nthat is fine about the great state pieces. In the \"Marriage of St.\r\nCatherine,\" the saint, in silken gown and long transparent veil, is an\r\nexquisite figure. Tintoretto bathes all his pageantry in golden light\r\nand air, and yet we feel that these huge official subjects, with the\r\nprosaic old Doges introduced in incongruous company, neither stimulated\r\nhis imagination nor satisfied his taste. It is on the smaller canvases\r\nthat he finds inspiration. He never painted anything more lovely, more\r\nperfect in design, or more gay and tender in idea, than the cycle in\r\nthe Ante-Collegio. The glowing light and exquisitely graded shadows upon\r\nivory limbs have a sensuous perfection and a refined, unselfconscious\r\njoy such as is felt in hardly any other work, except the painter's own\r\n\"Milky Way\" in the National Gallery. In all these four pictures the\r\nfeeling for design, a branch of art in which Tintoretto was past master,\r\nis fully displayed. In the Bacchus and Ariadne all the principal lines,\r\nthe eyes and gestures, converge upon the tiny ring which is the symbol\r\nof union between the goddess and her lover, between the queenly city and\r\nthe Adriatic sea. Or take \"Pallas driving away Mars\": see how the mass\r\ninto which the figures are gathered on the left adds strength to the\r\nthrust of the goddess's arm, and what steadiness is given by that short\r\nstraight lance of hers, coming in among all the yielding curves. The\r\nwhole four are linked together in meaning: the call to Venice to reign\r\nover the seas, her triumphant peace, with Wisdom guiding her council,\r\nand her warriors forging arms in case of need. In conjunction with these\r\npictures are two small ones in the chapel, hardly less beautiful--St.\r\nGeorge with St. Margaret, and SS. Andrew and Jerome. It is difficult to\r\nsay whether the exultant St. George, the dignified young bishop, or the\r\ntwo older saints are the more sympathetic creations, or the more\r\nadmirable, both in drawing and colour. The sense of space in both\r\nsettings is an added charm, and every scrap of detail, the leafy\r\nboughs, the cross and crozier, is important to the composition.\r\n\r\nThere are many other striking examples, ranging all through Tintoretto's\r\nlife, of his untiring imagination. In the Salute is that \"Marriage of\r\nCana,\" in which all the actors seem to swim in golden light. The sharp\r\nsilhouettes bring out an effect of radiant sunshine with which the hall\r\nis flooded, and all the architectural lines lead our eyes towards the\r\ncentral figure, placed at a distance. On that long canvas in the\r\nAcademy, kneel the three treasurers, pouring out their gold and bending\r\nin homage before the Madonna and Child, who sit enthroned upon a broad\r\npiazza, through the marble pillars of which a blue and distant landscape\r\nshines. Grave senators in mulberry velvet and ermine kneel before the\r\nChild, or hold counsel on Paduan affairs under the patronage of S.\r\nGiustina. The \"Crucifixion\" (in S. Cassiano) is another triumph of the\r\npainter's imaginative conception. The bold lines of the crosses, the\r\nladder, and the figures detach against a glorious sky, and the presence\r\nof the moving, murmuring throng, of which, by the placing of the line of\r\nsight, the spectator is made to form a part, is conveyed by the swaying\r\nand crossing of the lances borne by the armed men who keep the ground.\r\nThere is a series, too, which deals with the Magdalen. She mourns her\r\ndead in that solemn, restrained \"Entombment,\" where the enfolding\r\nshadows frame the cross against the sad dawn, which adorns the mortuary\r\nchapel of S. Giorgio Maggiore; and the Pietà in the Brera, the long\r\nlines of which add to the impression of tender repose, has its peace\r\nbroken by the passionate cry of the woman who loved much. Tintoretto's\r\nideas are exhaustless; he can paint the same scene in a dozen different\r\nways, and, in fact, the book of sketches lately acquired by the British\r\nMuseum shows as many as thirty trials dashed off for one subject, and\r\nafter all he uses one composed for something quite different. It is this\r\nhabit of throwing off red-hot essays, fresh from his brain, that has led\r\nto the common but superficial judgment that Tintoretto was merely a\r\ngreat improvisatore, whose successes came more or less by good luck. He\r\ncould, indeed, paint pictures at a pace at which many great masters\r\ncould only sketch, but he had already designed and considered and\r\nrejected, doing with oil, ink, and paper what many of his contemporaries\r\ndid mentally. Such achievements as the Ante-Collegio cycle, the \"House\r\nof Martha and Mary,\" the \"Marriage of Cana,\" the \"Temptation of S.\r\nAnthony,\" to name only a few, show a finish and perfection and a balance\r\nof design which preclude the idea of their being lightly painted\r\npictures. When he was actually engaged, Tintoretto let himself go with\r\nimpetuous ardour, but we may feel assured he left nothing to chance,\r\nthough he had his own way of making sure of the result.\r\n\r\nIt is strange to hear people, as one does now and then, talking of the\r\n\"Paradiso\" as \"a splendid failure.\" It may be granted that the subject\r\nis an impossible one for human art to realise, yet when all allowance\r\nhas been made for a lamentable amount of drying and blackening, it is\r\ndifficult to agree that Ruskin was all wrong in his admiration of that\r\nthronging multitude, ordered and disciplined by the tides of light and\r\nshadow, which roll in and out of the masses, resolving them into groups\r\nand single figures of almost matchless beauty and melting away into a\r\nsea of radiant æther, which tells us of the boundless space which\r\nsurrounds the serried ranks of the Blessed.\r\n\r\nTintoretto was seventy-eight when it was allotted to him, and it was the\r\nlast great effort of his mind and hand. Studies for it are preserved\r\nboth at the Louvre and at Madrid, and it is evident that the painter\r\nhas framed it upon the thought of Dante's mystic rose. The circles and\r\nmany of the figures can be traced in the poem, and the idea of the\r\nEternal Light streaming through the leaves of the rose dominates the\r\ncomposition. It is appropriate that it should have been his last great\r\nwork, as it was also the greatest attempt at composition ever made by a\r\nmaster of the Venetian School.\r\n\r\nThere is no room here to study Tintoretto as a painter of battlepieces,\r\nthough from the time he painted the \"Battle of Lepanto,\" for the Council\r\nof Ten, he often returned to such subjects. His two series for the\r\nGonzaga included several, and the Ducal Palace still possesses examples.\r\nThe impetuosity of his style stood him in good stead, and he never fails\r\nto bring in graceful and striking figures.\r\n\r\nHis portraits are hardly equal to Titian's intellectual grasp or\r\nfine-grained colour, but they are extraordinarily characteristic. He\r\nprefers to paint men rather than women, and he painted hundreds--all the\r\ngreat persons of his time who lived in and visited Venice. The Venetian\r\nportrait by this time was expected to be more than a likeness and more\r\nthan a problem. It was to please the taste as a picture, to interest and\r\nto satisfy criticism. Tintoretto, like Lotto, gets behind the scenes,\r\nand we see some mood, some aspect of the sitter that he hardly expected\r\nto show. His penetration is not equal to Lotto's, but he deals with his\r\nsitters with an observation which pierces below the surface.\r\n\r\nIn criticising Tintoretto, men seem often unable to discriminate between\r\nthe turgid and melodramatic, and the spontaneous and temperamental. The\r\nfirst all must abhor, but the last is sincere and deserves to be\r\nrespected. It is by his best that we must judge a man, and taking his\r\nbest and undoubtedly authentic work, no one has left a larger amount\r\nwhich will stand the test of criticism. As an exponent of lofty and\r\nelevated central ideas, which unify all parts of his composition,\r\nTintoretto stands with the greatest imaginative minds. The intellectual\r\nside of life was exemplified in Florentine art, but the Renaissance\r\nwould have been a one-sided development if there had not arisen a body\r\nof men to whom emotion and the gift of sensuous apprehension seemed of\r\nsupreme value, and at the very last there arose with him one who, to\r\ntheir philosophy of feeling and the mastery of their chosen medium,\r\nadded the crowning glory of the imaginative idea.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\r\n\r\n Augsburg.

Bassano once held an important position on the main road\r\nbetween Italy and Germany, but since the railroad was made across the\r\nBrenner Pass, few people ever see the little town which lies cradled on\r\nthe spurs of the Italian Alps, where the gorge of Valsugana opens. It is\r\nsurrounded by chestnut woods, which sweep up to the blue mountains, the\r\nwide Brenta flows through the town, and the houses cluster high on\r\neither side, and have gardens and balconies overhanging the water. The\r\nfaçades of many of the houses are covered with fading frescoes, relics\r\nof da Ponte's school of fresco-painters, which, though they are fast\r\nperishing, still give a wonderful effect of warmth and colour.\r\n\r\nJacopo da Ponte was the son and pupil of his father, Francesco, who\r\nin his day had been a pupil of the Vicentine, Bartolommeo Montagna.\r\nFrancesco da Ponte's best work is to be found at Bassano, in the\r\ncathedral and the church of San Giovanni, and has many of the\r\ncharacteristics, such as the raised pedestal and vaulted cupola, which\r\nwe have noticed that Montagna owed to the Vivarini. Francesco's son\r\nwent when very young to Venice, and was there thrown at once among the\r\nartists of the lagoons, and attached himself in particular to Bonifazio.\r\nIn Jacopo's earliest work, now in the Museum at Bassano, a \"Flight into\r\nEgypt,\" Bonifazio's tuition is markedly discernible in the build of the\r\nfigures and, above all, in the form of the heads. A comparison of the\r\nvery peculiarly shaped head of the Virgin in this picture with that of\r\nthe Venetian lady in Bonifazio's \"Rich Man's Feast,\" in the Venetian\r\nAcademy, leaves us in no doubt on this score. Jacopo's \"Adulteress\r\nbefore Christ\" and the \"Three in the Fiery Furnace\" have Bonifazio's\r\nmanner in the architecture and the staging of the figures. Only five\r\nexamples are known of this early work of da Ponte, and it is all in\r\nBonifazio's lighter style, not unlike his \"Holy Family\" in the National\r\nGallery.\r\n\r\nThe house in which the painter lived when he returned to his native\r\ntown, still stands in the little Piazza Monte Vecchio, and its whole\r\nfaçade retains the frescoes, mouldy and decaying, with which he\r\ndecorated it. The design is in four horizontal bands. First comes a\r\nfrieze of children in every attitude of fun and frolic. Then follows a\r\nlong range of animals--horses, oxen, and deer. Musical instruments and\r\nflowers make a border, with allegorical representations of the arts and\r\ncrafts filling the spaces between the windows. The principal band is\r\ndecorated with Scriptural subjects, most of which are now hardly\r\ndiscernible, but which represent \"Samson slaying the Philistines,\"\r\n\"The Drunkenness of Noah,\" \"Cain and Abel,\" \"Lot and his Daughters,\"\r\nand \"Judith with the Head of Holofernes.\" Between the two last there\r\nformerly appeared a drawing of a dead child, with the motto, \"Mors omnia\r\naequat,\" which was removed to the Museum in 1883, in comparatively good\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\nJacopo da Ponte lived a busy life at Bassano, where, with the help of\r\nhis four sons, who were all painters, he poured out an inexhaustible\r\nstream of works, which, it is said, were put up to auction at the\r\nneighbouring fairs, if no other market was forthcoming. From time to\r\ntime he and his sons went down to Venice, and with the help of the\r\neldest, Francesco, Bassano (as he is generally known) painted the \"Siege\r\nof Padua\" and five other works in the Ducal Palace. His mature style was\r\nfounded mainly upon that of Titian, and it is to this second manner that\r\nhe owes his fame. He makes use of fewer colours, and enhances his lights\r\nby deepening and consolidating his shadows, so that they come into\r\nstrong contrast, and his technique gains a richer impasto. He has a\r\nmarvellous faculty for keeping his colour pure, and his greens shine\r\nlike a beetle's wing. A nature-lover in the highest degree, his painting\r\nof animals and plants evinces a mind which is steeped in the magic of\r\noutdoor life. A subject of which he was particularly fond, and which he\r\nseems to have undertaken for half the collectors of Europe, was the\r\n\"Four Seasons.\" Here was found united everything that Bassano most loved\r\nto paint: beasts of the farmyard and countryside, agriculturists with\r\ntheir implements, scenes of harvest-time and vintage, rough peasants\r\nleading the plough, cutting the grass, harvesting the grain, young girls\r\nmaking hay, driving home the cattle, taking dinner to the reapers. When\r\nhe was obliged to paint for churches he chose such subjects as the\r\nAdoration of the Shepherds, the Sacrifice of Noah, the Expulsion from\r\nthe Temple, into which he could introduce animals, painting them with\r\nsuch vigour and such forcible colour that Titian himself is said to\r\nhave had a copy hanging in his studio. He loved to paint his daughters\r\nengaged in household tasks, and perhaps placed his figures with rather\r\ntoo obvious a reference to light and shade, and to the sun striking\r\nfull on sunburnt cheeks and buxom shoulders. A friend, not a rival, of\r\nVeronese and Tintoretto, Gianbattista Volpado, records that when he was\r\none day discussing contemporary painters with the latter, Tintoretto\r\nexclaimed, \"Ah, Jacopo, if you had my drawing and I had your colour I\r\nwould defy the devil himself to enable Titian, Raphael, and the rest to\r\nmake any show beside us.\"\r\n\r\nBassano was invited to take up his residence at the Court of the Emperor\r\nRudolph, but he refused to leave his mountain city, where he died in\r\n1592. His funeral was attended by a crowd of the poorest inhabitants,\r\nfor whom his charity had been boundless.\r\n\r\nThe \"Journey of Jacob,\" to which we have already alluded, is among his\r\nmost beautiful works. The brilliant array of figures is subordinated to\r\nthe charm of the landscape. The evening dusk draws all objects into its\r\nembrace. The long, low, deep-blue distance stands out against a gleam\r\nof sunset sky. The tree-trunks and light play of leafy branches, which\r\nbreak up the composition, are from da Ponte's own country round Bassano.\r\nThe pony upon which the boy scrambles, the cows, the dog among the quiet\r\nsheep, are given with all the loving truth of the born animal-painter.\r\nIt is no wonder that Teniers borrowed ideas from him, and has more than\r\nonce imitated his whole design.\r\n\r\nThe \"Baptism of St. Lucilla\" (in the Museum at Bassano) is one of his\r\nmost Titianesque creations. The personages in it are grouped upon a\r\nflight of steps, in front of a long Renaissance palace with cypresses\r\nagainst a sky of evening-red barred with purple clouds. The drawing\r\nand modelling of the figures are almost faultless, and the colour is\r\ndazzling. The bending figure of S. Lucilla, with the light falling on\r\nher silvery satin dress, as she kneels before the young bishop, St.\r\nValentine, is one of the most graceful things in art, and Titian himself\r\nneed not have disowned the little angels, bearing palm branches and\r\nfrolicking in the stream of radiance overhead.\r\n\r\nBassano has a \"Concert,\" which is interesting as a family piece. It was\r\npainted in the year in which his son Leandro's marriage took place, and\r\nis probably a bridal painting to celebrate the event. The \"Magistrates\r\nin Adoration\" (Vicenza) again gives a brilliant effect of light, and\r\nits stately ceremonial is founded on Tintoretto's numerous pictures of\r\nkneeling doges and procurators in fur-trimmed velvet robes.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Jacopo da Ponte._\r\n                 BAPTISM OF S. LUCILLA.\r\n                _Bassano._\r\n                 (_Photo, Alinari._)]\r\n\r\nMadonnas and saints are usually built into close-packed pyramids, but\r\nin the \"Repose in Egypt,\" now in the Ambrosiana, Milan, his arrangement\r\ncomes very close to Palma and Lotto. The beautiful Mother and Child,\r\nthe attendants, above all the St. Joseph, resting, head on hand, at the\r\nVirgin's feet and gazing in rapt adoration on the Child, are examples of\r\nthe true Venetian manner, while the exquisite landscape behind them, and\r\nthe vigorously drawn tree under which they recline, show Bassano true to\r\nhis passion for nature.\r\n\r\nHampton Court is rich in his pictures. \"The Adoration of the Shepherds,\"\r\nin which the pillars rise behind the sacred group, is an exercise in\r\nthe manner of Titian's Frari altarpiece. His portraits are fine and\r\nsympathetic, but hardly any of them are signed or can be dated. His\r\nown is in the Uffizi, and there is a splendid \"Old Man\" at Buda-Pesth.\r\nAriosto and Tasso, Sebastian Venier, and many other distinguished\r\nmen were among his sitters; most of them are in half-length with\r\nthree-quarter heads. The National Gallery possesses a singularly\r\nattractive one of a young man with a sensitive, acute countenance,\r\nrobed in dignified, picturesque black, relieved by an embroidered linen\r\ncollar. He stands by the sort of square window, opening on a distant\r\nlandscape, of which Tintoretto and Lotto so often made use, in front of\r\nwhich a golden vase, holding a branch of olive, catches the rays of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nBassano has no great power of design, and his knowledge of the nude\r\nseems to have been small, but his brushwork is facile, and his colour\r\nleaps out with a vivid beauty which obliterates other shortcomings.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\r\n\r\n Augsburg.

Hardly a great English house but boasts\r\nof a round dozen at least of such specimens, acquired in the days when\r\nrich Englishmen made the \"grand tour\" and substantiated a reputation for\r\ntaste and culture by collecting works of art. These pictures resemble\r\nthe genuine article in a specious yet half-hearted way. Their owners\r\nthemselves are not very tenacious as to their authenticity, and the\r\nvisit of an expert, or the ordeal of a public exhibition tears their\r\npretensions to tatters. In the Academia itself the Bonifazio and\r\nTintoretto rooms are crowded with imitations. The Ducal Palace has\r\nceilings and panels on which are reproduced the kind of compositions\r\ninitiated by the great artists, which make an effort to capture their\r\ngamut of colour and to master their scheme of chiaroscuro, copying them,\r\nin short, in everything except in their inimitable touch and fire and\r\nspirit. It would have been impossible for any men, however industrious\r\nand prolific, to have carried out all the work which passes under their\r\nnames, to say nothing of that which has perished; but our surprise and\r\ncuriosity diminish when we come to inquire systematically into the\r\nmethods of that host of copyists which, even before the masters' death,\r\nhad begun to ply its lucrative trade.\r\n\r\nWe must bear in mind that every great man was surrounded by busy and\r\nattentive satellites, helping him to finish and, indeed, often painting\r\na large part of important commissions, witnesses of the high prices\r\nreceived, and alive to all the gossip as to the relative popularity of\r\nthe painters and the requests and orders which reached them from all\r\nquarters. The painters' own sons were in many instances those who first\r\ntraded upon their fathers' fame. From Ridolfi, Zanetti, or Boschini we\r\nlearn of the many paintings executed by Carlotto Caliari and the vast\r\nnumbers painted by Domenico Robusti in the style of their respective\r\nfathers. Domenico seems to have particularly affected the subject of\r\n\"St. George and the Dragon,\" and the picture at Dresden, which passes\r\nunder Tintoretto's name, is perhaps by his hand. Of Bassano's four sons,\r\nFrancesco \"imitated his father perfectly,\" conserving his warmth of\r\ntint, his relief and breadth. Zanetti enumerates a surprising number of\r\nFrancesco's works, seven of them being painted for the Ducal Palace.\r\nLeandro followed more particularly his father's first manner, was a good\r\nportrait-painter, and possessed lightness and fancy. Girolamo copied and\r\nrecopied the old Bassano till he even deceived connoisseurs, \"how much\r\nmore,\" says Zanetti, writing in 1771, \"those of the present day, who\r\nbehold them harmonised and accredited by time.\" No school in Venice was\r\nso beloved, or lent itself so well to the efforts of the imitators, as\r\nthat of Paolo Veronese. Even at an early date it was impossible not to\r\nconfound the master with the disciples; the weaker of the originals were\r\nheld to be of imitators, the best imitations were assigned to the master\r\nhimself. \"Oh how easy it is,\" exclaims Zanetti again, \"to make mistakes\r\nabout Veronese's pictures, but I can point out sundry infallible\r\ncharacteristics to those who wish for light upon this doubtful path; the\r\nfineness and lightness of the brushwork, the sublime intelligence and\r\ngrace, shown particularly in the form of the heads, which is never found\r\nin any of his imitators.\"\r\n\r\nFew Venetians, however, followed the style of only one man; the output\r\nwas probably determined and varied by the demand. Too many attractive\r\nmanners existed to dazzle them, and when once they began to imitate,\r\nthey were tempted on all hands. It must also be remembered that every\r\nmaster left behind him stacks of cartoons, sketches and suggestions, and\r\nhalf-finished pictures, which were eagerly seized upon, bought or\r\nstolen, and utilised to produce masterpieces masquerading under his\r\nname.\r\n\r\nAs the seventeenth century advanced the character of art and manners\r\nunderwent a change. Men sought the beautiful in the novel and bizarre,\r\nand the complex was preferred to the simple. Venetian art, in all its\r\nbranches, had passed from the stately and restrained to the pompous and\r\nartificial. Yet the barocco style was used by Venice in a way of its\r\nown; whimsical, contorted, and overloaded with ornament as it is, it yet\r\ncompels admiration by its vigorous life and movement. The art of the\r\nsei-cento in Venice was extravagant, but it was alive. It escaped the\r\nmost deadly of all faults, a cold and academic mannerism--and this at a\r\ntime when the rest of Italy was given over to the inflated followers of\r\nMichelangelo and the calculated elaborations of the eclectics.\r\n\r\nMany of the things we most love in Venice, such as the Salute, the\r\nClock-Tower, the Dogana, the Bridge of Sighs, the Rezzonico and\r\nPesaro Palaces, are additions of the seventeenth century. The barocco\r\nintemperance in sculpture was carried on by disciples of Bernini; and\r\nas the immediate influence of the great masters declined, painting\r\nacquired the same sort of character. The carelessness and rapidity of\r\nTintoretto, which, in his case, proceeded from the lightning speed of\r\nhis imagination and the unerring sureness of his brush, became a\r\nmechanical trick in the hands of superficial students. True art had\r\nmigrated elsewhere--to the homes of Velasquez, Rubens, and Rembrandt. As\r\nart grew more pompous it became less emotional. Painters like Palma\r\nGiovine spoilt their ready, lively fancy by the vice of hurry. The\r\nnickname of \"Fa Presto\" was deserved by others besides Luca Giordano,\r\nand Venice was overrun by a swarm of painters whose prime standard of\r\nexcellence was the ability to make haste. Grandeur of conception was\r\nforgotten; a grave, ample manner was no longer understood; superficial\r\nsentiment and bombastic size carried the day. Yet a few painters, though\r\ntheir forms had become redundant and exaggerated, retained something of\r\nwhat had been the Venetian glory--the deep and moist colour of old. It\r\nstill glowed with traces of its old lustre on the canvases of Giovanni\r\nContarini, or Tiberio Tinelli, or Pietro Liberi; and though there was a\r\nperfect fury of production, without order and without law, there can\r\nstill be perceived the survival of that sense of the decorative which\r\nkept the thread of art. We discover it in the ceiling of the Church of\r\nSan Pantaleone, where Gianbattista Fumiani paints the glorification of\r\nthe martyred patron, and which, fantastic and extravagant as it is,\r\nwith its stupendous, architectural setting, and its acutely, almost\r\nabsurdly foreshortened throng, is not without a certain grandiose\r\ngeniality, ample and picturesque, like the buildings of that date. In\r\nAlessandro Varotari (il Padovanino), whose \"Nozze di Cana\" in the\r\nAcademia is a finely spaced scene, in which a charming use is made of\r\ncypresses, we seem to recognise the last ray of the Titianesque. The\r\npainting of the seventeenth century passed on towards the eighteenth,\r\nand, from ceilings and panels, rosy nymphs and Venuses smile at\r\nus, attitudinising and contorted upon their cloudy backgrounds.\r\nLackadaisical Magdalens drop sentimental tears, and the Angel of the\r\nAnnunciation capers above the head of an affected Virgin, while violent\r\ncolours, intensified chiaroscuro, and black greasy impasto betray\r\nthe neighbourhood of the _tenebrosi_. When, towards the end of the\r\nseventeenth century, Gregorio Lazzarini set himself to shake off these\r\ninfluences, he went to the opposite extreme. Although a beautiful\r\ndesigner, he becomes cold and flat in colour, with a coldness and\r\ninsipidity, indeed, that take us by surprise, appearing in a country\r\nwhere the taste for luminous and brilliant tints was so strongly rooted.\r\nThe student of Venetian painting, who wishes to fill up the hiatus which\r\nlies between the Golden Age and the revival of the eighteenth century,\r\ncannot do better than compare Fumiani's vault in San Pantaleone with\r\nLazzarini's sober and earnest fresco, \"The Charity of San Lorenzo\r\nGiustiniani,\" in San Pietro in Castello, and with Pietro Liberi's\r\n\"Battle of the Dardanelles\" in the Ducal Palace. In all three we have\r\nexamples of the varied and accomplished yet soulless art of this period.\r\nNot many of the scenes painted for the palaces of patricians in the\r\nseventeenth century have survived. They are to be found here and\r\nthere by the curious who wander into old churches and palaces with a\r\nsecond-hand copy of Boschini in their hands; but in the reaction from\r\nthe florid which took place in the Empire period, many of them gave\r\nplace to whitewash and stucco. In the Ducal Palace, side by side with\r\nthe masterpieces of the Renaissance, are to be found the overcrowded\r\ncanvases of Vicentino, Giovanni Contarini, Pietro Liberi, Celesti, and\r\nothers like them. Some of the poor and meretricious mosaics in St.\r\nMark's are from designs by Palma Giovine and Fumiani. Carlo Ridolfi, who\r\nwas a painter himself, as well as the painter's chronicler, has an\r\n\"Adoration of the Magi\" in S. Giovanni Elemosinario, poor enough in\r\ninvention and execution. Two pictures by obscure artists disfigure a\r\ncorner of the Scuola di San Rocco. The Museo Civico has a large canvas\r\nby Vicentino, a \"Coronation of a Dogaressa,\" which once adorned Palazzo\r\nGrimani. We hear of a school opened by Antonio Balestra, who was the\r\nmaster of Rosalba Carriera and Pietro Longhi, and the names of others\r\nhave come down to us in numbers too numerous to be quoted. Towards the\r\nend of the seventeenth century more light and novelty sparkles in the\r\npainting of the Bellunese, Battista Ricci, and assures us that he was no\r\nmere copyist; and, as the eighteenth century opens, we become aware of\r\nthe strong and daring brush of Gianbattista Piazetta. Piazetta studied\r\nthe works of the Carracci for some time in Bologna, and especially those\r\nof Guercino, whose style, with its bold contrasts of light and shade,\r\nhas served above all as his model. He paints very darkly, and his\r\nfigures often blend with and disappear into the profound tones of his\r\nbackgrounds. Charles Blanc calls him \"a Venetian Caravaggio\"; and he has\r\nsomething of the strength and even the brutality of the Bolognese. A\r\nfine decorative and imaginative example of his work is the \"Madonna\r\nappearing to S. Philip Neri\" in the Church of S. Fava. The erect form of\r\nthe Madonna is relieved in striking chiaroscuro against the mantle,\r\nupheld by _putti_. Radiant clouds light up the background and illumine\r\nthe form of the old saint, a refined and spirited figure, gazing at\r\nthe vision in an ecstasy of devotion. Piazetta is a bold realist, and\r\nmany of his small pictures are strong and forcible. Sebastiano Ricci,\r\nBattista's son, is described as \"a fine intelligence,\" and attracts\r\nour notice as having forged special links with England. Hampton Court\r\npossesses a long array of his paintings. In the chapel of Chelsea\r\nHospital the plaster semi-dome is painted by him, in oils, with very\r\ngood effect. He is said to have worked in Thornhill's studio, and his\r\ninfluence may be suspected in the Blenheim frescoes, and even in touches\r\nin Hogarth's work.\r\n\r\nBy the eighteenth century Venice had parted with her old nobility of\r\nsoul, and enjoyment had become the only aim of life. Yet Venice, among\r\nthe States of Italy, alone retained her freedom. The Doge reigned\r\nsupreme as in the past. Beneath the ceiling of Veronese the dreaded\r\nThree still sat in secret council. Venice was still the city of subtle\r\npoisons and dangerous mysteries, but the days were gone when she\r\nhad held the balance in European affairs, and she had become, in a\r\nsuperlative degree, the city of pleasure. Nowhere was life more\r\nvaried and entertaining, more full of grace and enchantment.\r\n\r\nA long period of peace had rocked the Venetian people into calm\r\nsecurity. There was, indeed, a little spasmodic fighting in Corfù,\r\nDalmatia, and Algiers, but no real share was retained in the\r\nstruggles of Europe. The whole policy of the city's life was one of\r\nself-indulgence. Holiday-makers filled her streets; the whole population\r\nlived \"in piazza,\" laughing, gossiping, seeing and being seen. The\r\nvery churches had become a rendezvous for fashionable intrigues; the\r\nconvents boasted their _salons_, where nuns in low dresses, with pearls\r\nin their hair, received the advances of nobles and gallant abbés.\r\nPeople came to Venice to waste time; trivialities, the last scandal,\r\nsensational stories, were the only subjects worth discussing. In an age\r\nof parodies and practical jokes, the more absurd any one could be, the\r\nmore silly or witty stories he could tell, the more assured was his\r\nsuccess in the joyous, frivolous circle, full of fun and laughter. The\r\nCarnival lasted for six months of the year, and was the occasion for\r\nmasques and licence of every description. In the hot weather, the gay\r\ndescendants of the Contarini, the Loredan, the Pisani, and other grand\r\nold houses, migrated to villas along the Brenta, where by day and night\r\nthe same reckless, irresponsible life went gaily on. The power of such\r\ncourtesans as Titian and Paris Bordone had painted was waning. Their\r\nplace was adequately supplied by the easy dames of society, no longer\r\nsecluded, proud and tranquil, but \"stirred by the wild blood of youth\r\nand stooping to the frolic.\" \"They are but faces and smiles, teasing\r\nand trumpery,\" says one of their critics, yet they are declared to be\r\nwideawake, natural and charming, making the most of their smattering of\r\nletters. Love was the great game; every woman had lovers, every married\r\nwoman openly flaunted her _cicisbeo_ or _cavaliere servente_.\r\n\r\nThe older portion of the middle class was still moderate and temperate,\r\ncontented to live in the old fashion, eschewing all interest in\r\npolitics, with which it was dangerous for the ordinary individual to\r\nmeddle; but the new leaven was creeping through every level of society.\r\nThe sons and daughters of the _bourgeoisie_ tried to rise in the social\r\nscale by aping the pleasant vices of the aristocracy. They deserted the\r\nshop and the counting-house to play cards and strut upon the piazza.\r\nThey mimicked the fine gentleman and the gentildonna, and made\r\nfashionable love and carried on intrigues. The spirit of the whole\r\npeople had lost its elevation; there were no more proud patricians, full\r\nof noble ambitions and devoted zeal of public service; it was hardly\r\npossible to get a sufficient number of persons to carry on public\r\nbusiness. It is a contemptible indictment enough; yet among all this\r\ndegenerate life, we come upon something more real as we turn to the\r\nartists. They were very much alive. In music, in literature, and in\r\npainting, new and graceful forms of art were emerging. Painting was not\r\nthe grand art of other days; it might be small and trivial, but there\r\ngrew up a real little Renaissance of the eighteenth century, full of\r\noriginality and fire, and showing a reaction from the pompous and banale\r\nstyle of the imitators.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the \"lady\" was becoming increasingly felt by society.\r\nConfidential little boudoirs, small and cosy apartments were the mode,\r\nand needed decorating as well as vast salas. The dainty luxury of gilt\r\nfurniture, designed by Andrea Brustolon and upholstered in delicate\r\nsilks, was matched by small, attractive works of art. Venice had lost\r\nher Eastern trade, and as the East faded out of her scheme of life, the\r\nWest, to which she now turned, was bringing her a different form of\r\nart. The great reception rooms were still suited by the grandiose\r\ncompositions of Ricci, Piazetta, and Pittoni, but another genre of\r\ncharming creations smiled from the brocaded alcoves and more intimate\r\nsuites of rooms.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to name more than a fraction of these artists of the\r\neighteenth century. There is Amigoni, admirable as a portrait-painter;\r\nPittoni, one of the ablest figure-painters of the day; Luca Carlevaris,\r\nthe forerunner of Canale; Pellegrini, whose decorations in this country\r\nare mentioned by Horace Walpole and of which the most important are\r\npreserved in the cupola and spandrils of the Grand Hall at Castle\r\nHoward. Their work is still to be found in many a Venetian church or\r\nNorth Italian gallery. Some of it is almost fine, though too often\r\nvitiated by the affected, exaggerated spirit of their day. When\r\noriginality asserts itself more decidedly, Rosalba Carriera stands out\r\nas an artist who acquired great popularity. In 1700, when she was a\r\nyoung woman of twenty-four, she was already a great favourite with the\r\npublic. She began life as a lace-maker, but when trade was bad, Jean\r\nStève, a Frenchman, taught her to paint miniatures. She imparted a\r\nwonderfully delicate feeling to her art, and, passing on to pastel, she\r\nbrought to this branch of portraiture a brilliancy and freshness which\r\nit had not known before. Rosalba has perhaps preserved for us better\r\nthan any one else, those women of Venice who floated so lightly on the\r\ndancing waves of that sparkling stream. There they are: La Cornaro; La\r\nMaria Labia, who was surrounded by French lovers, \"very courteous and\r\nvery beautiful\"; La Zenobio and La Pisani; La Foscari, with her black\r\nplumes; La Mocenigo, \"the lady with the pearls.\" She has pinned them all\r\nto the canvas; lovely, frail, light-hearted butterflies, with velvet\r\nneck-ribbons round their snowy throats and coquettish patches on their\r\ndelicate skin and bouquets of flowers in their high-dressed hair and\r\nsheeny bodices. They look at us with arch eyes and smile with melting\r\nmouths, more frivolous than depraved; sweet, ephemeral, irresponsible in\r\nevery relation of life. Older men and women there are, too, when those\r\nartificial years have produced a succession of rather dull, sodden\r\npersonages, kindly, inoffensive, but stupid, and still trifling heavily\r\nwith the world.\r\n\r\nOf Rosalba we have another picture to compare with those of her sitters.\r\nShe and the other artists of her circle lived the merry, busy life of\r\nthe worker, and found in their art the antidote to the evil living and\r\nthe dissipation of the gay world which provided sitters and patrons.\r\nRosalba's _milieu_ is a type of others of its class. She lives with her\r\nmother and sisters, an honest, cheerful, industrious existence. They are\r\nfond of old friends and old books, and indulge in music and simple\r\npleasures. Her sisters help Rosalba by preparing the groundwork of\r\nher paintings. She pays visits, and writes rhymes, and plays on the\r\nharpsichord. She receives great men without much ceremony, and the\r\nElector Palatine, the Duke of Mecklenburg, Frederick, King of Norway,\r\nand Maximilian, King of Bavaria, come to her to order miniatures of\r\ntheir reigning beauties. Then she goes off to Paris where she has plenty\r\nof commissions, and the frequently occurring names of English patrons in\r\nher fragmentary diaries, tell how much her work was admired by English\r\ntravellers. She did more than anybody else to promote the fashion for\r\npastels, and her delightful art may be seen at its best in the pastel\r\nroom of the Dresden Gallery.\r\n\r\nHenrietta, Countess of Pomfret, has left us a charming description of a\r\nparty of English travellers, which included Horace Walpole, arriving in\r\nVenice in 1741, strolling about in mask and _bauta_, and visiting the\r\nfamous pastellist in her studio. It is in such guise that Rosalba has\r\npainted Walpole, and has left one of the most interesting examples of\r\nher art.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME EXAMPLES\r\n\r\n _Francesco da Ponte._\r\n\r\n Venice.

Such a genius stands out\r\nabove the eighteenth century crowd, and is not only of his century, but\r\nof every time. For two hundred years Tiepolo has been stigmatised as\r\nextravagant, mannered, as just equal to painting cupids, nymphs, and\r\nparroquets. In the last century he experienced the effect of the\r\nprofound discredit into which the whole of eighteenth-century art had\r\nfallen. In France, David had obliterated Watteau; and the reputation\r\nof Pompeo Battoni, a sort of Italian David, effaced Tiepolo and his\r\ncontemporaries. When the delegates of the French Republic inspected\r\nItalian churches and palaces, and decided what works of art should be\r\nsent to the Louvre, they singled out the Bolognese, the Guercinos and\r\nGuidos, the Carracci, even Pompeo Battoni and other such forgotten\r\nmasters, a Gatti, a Nevelone, a Badalocchio; but to the lasting regret\r\nof their descendants, they disdained to annex a single one of the great\r\npaintings of the Venetian, Gianbattista Tiepolo.\r\n\r\nEastlake only vouchsafes him one line as \"an artist of fantastic\r\nimagination.\" Most of the nineteenth-century critics do not even mention\r\nhim. Burckhardt dismisses him with a grudging line of praise, Blanc is\r\nequally disparaging, and for Taine he is a mere mannerist, yet his\r\ninfluence has been felt far beyond his lifetime; only now is he coming\r\ninto his own, and it is recognised that the _plein-air_ artist, the\r\nluminarist, the impressionist, owe no small share of their knowledge to\r\nhis inspiration.\r\n\r\nThe name of Tiepolo brings before us a whole string of illustrious\r\npersonages--doges and senators, magnificent procurators and great\r\ncaptains--but we have nothing to prove that the artist belonged to a\r\ndecayed branch of the famous patrician house. Born in Castello, the\r\npeople's quarter of Venice, he studied in early youth with that good\r\ndraughtsman, Lazzarini. At twenty-three he married the sister of\r\nFrancesco Guardi; Guardi, who comes between Longhi and Canale and who is\r\na better painter than either. Tiepolo appeared at a fortunate moment.\r\nThe demand for a facile, joyous genius was at its height. The life of\r\nthe aristocracy on the lagoons was every year growing more gay, more\r\nabandoned to capricious inclination, to light loves and absurd\r\namusements. And the art which reflected this life was called upon to\r\ngive gaiety rather than thought, costume rather than character. Yet if\r\nthe Venetian art had lost all connection with the grave magnificence of\r\nthe past, it had kept aloof from the academic coldness which was in\r\nfashion beyond the lagoons, so that though theatrical, it was with a\r\ncertain natural absurdity. The age had become romantic; the Arcadian\r\nconvention was in full force, Nature herself was pressed into the\r\nservice of idle, sentimental men and women. The country was pictured as\r\na place of delight, where the sun always shone and the peasants passed\r\ntheir time singing madrigals and indulging in rural pleasures. The\r\npublic, however, had begun to look for beauty; the traditions which had\r\nformed round the decorative schools were giving way to the appreciation\r\nof original work. Tiepolo, sincere and spontaneous even when he is\r\nsacrificing truth to caprice, struck the taste of the Venetians, and\r\nwithout emancipating himself from the tendencies of the time, contrives\r\nto introduce a fresh accent. All round him was a weak and self-indulgent\r\nworld, but within himself he possessed a fund of buoyant and\r\ninexhaustible energy. He evokes a throng of personages on the ceilings\r\nof the churches and palaces confided to his fancy. His creations range\r\nfrom mythology to religion, from the sublime to the grotesque. All\r\nOlympia appears upon his ample and luminous spaces. It is not to the\r\ncold, austere Lazzarini, or to the clashing chiaroscuro of Piazetta, or\r\nthe imaginative spirit of Battista Ricci, though he was touched by each\r\nof them, that we must turn for Tiepolo's derivation. Long before his\r\ntime, the kind of decoration of ceilings which we are apt to call\r\nTiepolesque; the foreshortened architecture, the columns and cornices,\r\nthe figures peopling the edifices, or reclining upon clouds, had been\r\nused by an increasing throng of painters. The style arose, indeed, in\r\nthe quattrocento; Mantegna, the Umbrians, and even Michelangelo had used\r\nit, though in a far more sober way than later generations. Correggio\r\nand the Venetians had perfected the idea, which the artists of the\r\nseventeenth century seized upon and carried to the most intemperate\r\nexcess. But Tiepolo rose above them all; he abandoned the heavy,\r\nexaggerated, contorted designs, which by this time defied all laws of\r\nequilibrium, and we must go back further than his immediate predecessors\r\nfor his origins. His claim to stand with Tintoretto or Veronese may be\r\ncontested, but he is nearest to these, and no doubt Veronese is the\r\nartist he studied with the greatest fervour. Without copying, he seems\r\nto have a natural affinity of spirit with Veronese and assimilates the\r\nample arrangement of his groups, the grace of his architecture, and his\r\ndecorative feeling for colour. Zanetti, who was one of Tiepolo's dearest\r\nfriends, writes: \"No painter of our time could so well recall the bright\r\nand happy creations of Veronese.\" The difference between them is more\r\none of period than of temperament. Paolo Veronese represented the\r\nopulence of a rich, strong society, full of noble life, while Tiepolo's\r\nlot was cast among effeminate men and frivolous women, and full of the\r\nmodern spirit himself, he adapts his genius to his time and devotes\r\nhimself to satisfy the theatrical, sentimental vein of the Venice of the\r\ndecadence. Full of enthusiasm for his work, he was ready to respond to\r\nany call. He went to and fro between Venice and the villas along the\r\nmainland and to the neighbouring towns. Then coveting wider fields, he\r\ntravelled to Milan and Genoa, where his frescoes still gleam in the\r\npalaces of the Dugnani, the Archinto, and the Clerici. At Würzburg in\r\nBavaria he achieved a magnificent series of decorations for the palace\r\nof the Prince-Archbishop. Then coming back to Italy, he painted\r\naltarpieces, portraits, pictures for his friends, and a fresh multitude\r\nof allegorical and mythological frescoes in palaces and villas. His\r\ncharming villa at Zianigo is frescoed from top to bottom by himself and\r\nhis sons, and has amusing examples of contemporary dress and manners.\r\n\r\nWhen the Academy was instituted in 1755, Tiepolo was appointed its\r\nfirst director, but the sort of employment it provided was not suited to\r\nhis impetuous spirit, and in 1762 he threw up the post and went off to\r\nSpain with his two sons. There he received a splendid welcome and was\r\nloaded with commissions, the only dissentient voice being that of\r\nRaphael Mengs, who, obsessed by the taste for the classic and the\r\nantique, was fiercely opposed to the Venetian's art. Tiepolo died\r\nsuddenly in Madrid in 1770, pencil in hand. Though he was past seventy,\r\nthe frescoes he has left there show that his hand was as firm and his\r\neye as sure as ever.\r\n\r\nHis frescoes have, as we have said, that frankly theatrical flavour\r\nwhich corresponds exactly to the taste of the time. Such works as the\r\n\"Transportation of the Holy House of Loretto\" in the Church of the\r\nScalzi in Venice, or the \"Triumph of Faith\" in that of the Pietà, the\r\n\"Triumph of Hercules\" in Palazzo Canossa in Verona, or the decorations\r\nin the magnificent villa of the Pisani at Strà, are extravagant and\r\nfantastic, yet have the impressive quality of genius. These last, which\r\nhave for subject the glorification of the Pisani, are full of portraits.\r\nThe patrician sons and daughters appear, surrounded by Abundance, War,\r\nand Wisdom. A woman holding a sceptre symbolises Europe. All round are\r\ngrouped flags and dragons, \"nations grappling in the airy blue,\" bands\r\nof Red Indians in their war-paint and happy couples making love. The\r\nidea of the history, the wealth, the supreme dignity of the House is\r\nparamount, and over all appears Fame, bearing the noble name into\r\nimmortality. In Palazzo Clerici at Milan a rich and prodigal committee\r\ngave the painter a free hand, and on the ceiling of a vast hall the Sun\r\nin a chariot, with four horses harnessed abreast, rises to the meridian,\r\nflooding the world with light. Venus and Saturn attend him, and his\r\nadvent is heralded by Mercury. A symbolical figure of the earth joys at\r\nhis coming, and a concourse of naiads, nymphs, and dolphins wait upon\r\nhis footsteps. In the school of the Carmine in Venice Tiepolo has left\r\none of his grandest displays. The haughty Queen of Heaven, who is his\r\nideal of the Virgin, bears the Child lightly on her arm, and, standing\r\nenthroned upon the rolling clouds, hardly deigns to acknowledge the\r\nhomage of the prostrate saint, on whom an attendant angel is bestowing\r\nher scapulary. The most charming _amoretti_ are disporting in all\r\ndirections, flinging themselves from on high in delicious _abandon_,\r\nalternating with lovely groups of the cardinal virtues. At Villa\r\nValmarana near Vicenza, after revelling among the gods, he comes to\r\nearth and delights in painting lovely ladies with almond eyes and\r\ncarnation cheeks, attended by their cavaliers, seated in balconies,\r\nlooking on at a play, or dancing minuets, and carnival scenes with\r\nmasques and dominoes and _fêtes champêtres_, which give us a picture of\r\nthe fashions and manners of the day. He brings in groups of Chinese in\r\noriental dress, and then he condescends to paint country girls and their\r\nrustic swains, in the style of Phyllis and Corydon.\r\n\r\nSometimes he becomes graver and more solid. He abandons the airy fancies\r\nscattered in cloud-land. The story of Esther in Palazzo Dugnano affords\r\nan opportunity for introducing magnificent architecture, warriors in\r\narmour, and stately dames in satin and brocades. He touches his highest\r\nin the decorations of Palazzo Labia, where Antony and Cleopatra, seated\r\nat their banquet, surrounded by pomp and revelry, regard one another\r\nsilently, with looks of sombre passion. Four exquisite panels have\r\nlately been acquired by the Brera Gallery, representing the loves of\r\nRinaldo and Armida, and are a feast of gay, delicate colour, with\r\nfascinating backgrounds of Italian gardens. The throne-room of the\r\npalace at Madrid has the same order of compositions--Æneas conducted\r\nby Venus from Time to Immortality, and other deifications of Spanish\r\nroyalty.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Tiepolo._\r\n                 ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA.\r\n                _Palazzo Labia, Venice._]\r\n\r\nNow and then Tiepolo is possessed by a tragic mood. In the Church of\r\nSan Alvise he has left a \"Way to Calvary,\" a \"Flagellation,\" and a\r\n\"Crowning of Thorns,\" which are intensely dramatic, and which show strong\r\nfeeling. Particularly striking is the contrast between the refined and\r\nsensitive type of his Christ and the realistic and even brutal study of\r\nthe two despairing malefactors--one a common ruffian, the other an aged\r\noffender of a higher class. His altarpiece at Este, representing S.\r\nTecla staying the plague, is painted with a real insight into disaster\r\nand agony, and S. Tecla is a pathetic and beautiful figure. Sometimes\r\nin his easel-pictures he paints a Head of Christ, a S. Anthony, or a\r\nCrucifixion, but he always returns before long to the ample spaces and\r\nfantastic subjects which his soul loved.\r\n\r\nTiepolo is a singular contradiction. His art suggests a strong being,\r\nheld captive by butterflies. Sometimes he is joyous and limpid,\r\nsometimes turbulent and strong, but he has always sincerity, force, and\r\nlife. A great space serves to exhilarate him, and he asks nothing better\r\nthan to cover it with angels and goddesses, white limbs among the\r\nclouds, sea-horses ridden by Tritons, patrician warriors in Roman\r\narmour, balustrades and columns and _amoretti_. He does not even need to\r\npounce his design, but puts in all sorts of improvised modifications\r\nwith a sure hand. The vastness of his frescoes, the daring poses of his\r\ncountless figures, and the freedom of his line speak eloquently of the\r\nmastery to which his hand had attained. He revels, above all, in effects\r\nof light--\"all the light of the sky, and all the light of the sea; all\r\nthe light of Venice ... in which he swims as in a bath. He paints not\r\nideas, scarcely even forms, but light. His ceilings are radiant, like\r\nthe sky of birds; his poems seem to be written in the clouds. Light is\r\nfairer than all things, and Tiepolo knows all the tricks and triumphs of\r\nlight.\"[6]\r\n\r\n [6] Philippe Monnier, _Venice in the Eighteenth Century_.\r\n\r\nNearly all his compositions have a serene and limpid horizon, with\r\nthe figures approaching it painted in clear, silvery hues, airy and\r\ndiaphanous, while the forms below are more muscular, the flesh tints are\r\ndeeper, and the whole of the foreground is often enveloped in shadow.\r\nVeronese had lit up the shadows, which, under his contemporaries, were\r\ngrowing gloomy. Tiepolo carries his art further on the same lines. He\r\nmakes his figures more graceful, his draperies more vaporous, and\r\nillumines his clouds with radiance. His faded blue and rose, his\r\ngolden-greys, and pearly whites and pastel tints are not so much solid\r\ncolours as caprices of light. We have remarked already that with\r\nVeronese the accessories of gleaming satins and rich brocades serve to\r\nobscure the persons. In many of Tiepolo's scenes the figures are lost\r\nin a flutter of drapery, subject and action melt away, and we are only\r\nconscious of soft harmonies of delicious colour, as ethereal as the\r\nhues of spring flowers in woodland ways and joyous meadows. With these\r\ndelicious, audacious fancies, put on with a nervous hand, we forget the\r\nage of profound and ardent passion, we escape from that of pompous\r\nsolemnity and studied grace, and we breathe an atmosphere of\r\nirresponsible and capricious pleasure. In this last word of her great\r\nmasters Venice keeps what her temperament loved--sensuous colour and\r\nemotional chiaroscuro, used to accentuate an art adapted to a city of\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nThe excellence of the old masters' drawings is a perpetual revelation.\r\nEven second-class men are almost invariably fine draughtsmen, proving\r\nthat drawing was looked upon as something over which it was necessary\r\nfor even the meanest to have entire mastery. Tiepolo's drawings,\r\npreserved in Venice and in various museums, are as beautiful as can be\r\nwished; perfect in execution and vivid in feeling. In Venice are twenty\r\nor thirty sheets in red carbon, of flights of angels, and of draperies\r\nstudied in every variety of fold.\r\n\r\nPoor work of his school is often ascribed to his sons, but the superb\r\n\"Stations of the Cross,\" in the Frari, which were etched by Domenico,\r\nand published as his own in his lifetime, are almost equal to the\r\nfather's work. Tiepolo had many immediate followers and imitators. The\r\ncolossal roof-painting of Fabio Canal in the Church of SS. Apostoli,\r\nVenice, may be pointed out as an example of one of these. But he is full\r\nof the tendencies of modern art. Mr. Berenson, writing of him, says he\r\nsometimes seems more the first than the last of a line, and notices how\r\nhe influenced many French artists of recent times, though none seem\r\nquite to have caught the secret of his light intensity and his exquisite\r\ncaprice.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\r\n\r\n Aranjuez.

Longhi's first\r\nundertakings, specimens of which exist in certain palaces in Venice,\r\nwere elaborate frescoes, showing the baneful influence of the Bolognese\r\nSchool, in which he studied for a time under Giuseppe Crispi. He\r\nattempts to place the deities of Olympus on his ceilings in emulation of\r\nTiepolo, but his Juno is heavy and common, and the Titans at her feet\r\nappear as a swarm of sprawling, ill-drawn nudities. He shows no faculty\r\nfor this kind of work, but he was thirty-two before he began to paint\r\nthose small easel-pictures which in his own dainty style illustrate the\r\n\"Vanity Fair\" of his period, and in which the eighteenth century lives\r\nfor us again.\r\n\r\nHis earliest training was in the goldsmith's art, and he has left many\r\ndrawings of plate, exquisite in their sense of graceful curve and their\r\nunerring precision of line. It was a moment when such things acquired a\r\nflawless purity of outline, and Longhi recognised their beauty with all\r\nthe sensitive perception of the artist and the practised workman. His\r\nstudies of draperies, gestures, and hands are also extraordinarily\r\ncareful, and he seems besides to have an intimate acquaintance with all\r\nthe elegant dissipation and languid excesses of a dying order. We feel\r\nthat he has himself been at home in the masquerade, has accompanied the\r\nlady to the fortune-teller, and, leaning over her graceful shoulder, has\r\nlistened to the soothsayer's murmurs. He has attended balls and routs,\r\ndanced minuets, and gossiped over tiny cups of China tea. He is the last\r\nchronicler of the Venetian feasts, and with him ends that long series\r\nthat began with Giorgione's concert and which developed and passed\r\nthrough suppers at Cana and banquets at the houses of Levi and the\r\nPharisee. We are no longer confronted with the sumptuosity of Bonifazio\r\nand Veronese; the immense tables covered with gold and silver plate, the\r\nlong lines of guests robed in splendid brocades, the stream of servants\r\nbearing huge salvers, or the bands of musicians, nor are there any more\r\nalfresco concerts, with nymphs and bacchantes. Instead there are\r\nmasques, the life of the Ridotto or gaming-house, routs and intrigues in\r\ndainty boudoirs, and surreptitious love-making in that city of eternal\r\ncarnival where the _bauta_ was almost a national costume. Longhi\r\nholds that post which in French art is filled by Watteau, Fragonard,\r\nand Lancret, the painters of _fêtes galantes_, and though he cannot be\r\nplaced on an equal footing with those masters, he is representative and\r\nsignificant enough. On his canvases are preserved for us the mysteries\r\nof the toilet, over which ladies and young men of fashion dawdled\r\nthrough the morning, the drinking of chocolate in _négligé_, the\r\nmomentous instants spent in choosing headgear and fixing patches, the\r\ntowers of hair built by the modish coiffeur--children trooping in, in\r\nhoops and uniforms, to kiss their mother's hand, the fine gentleman\r\nchoosing a waistcoat and ogling the pretty embroideress, the pert young\r\nmaidservant slipping a billet-doux into a beauty's hand under her\r\nhusband's nose, the old beau toying with a fan, or the discreet abbé\r\ntaking snuff over the morning gazette. The grand ladies of Longhi's day\r\npay visits in hoop and farthingale, the beaux make \"a leg,\" and the\r\nlacqueys hand chocolate. The beautiful Venetians and their gallants\r\nswim through the gavotte or gamble in the Ridotto, or they hasten to\r\nassignations, disguised in wide _bauti_ and carrying preposterous muffs.\r\nThe Correr Museum contains a number of his paintings and also his book\r\nof original sketches. One of the most entertaining of his canvases\r\nrepresents a visit of patricians to a nuns' parlour. The nuns and their\r\npupils lend an attentive ear to the whispers of the world. Their\r\ndresses are trimmed with _point de Venise_, and a little theatre is\r\nvisible in the background. This and the \"Sala del Ridotto\" which hangs\r\nnear, are marked by a free, bold handling, a richness of colouring, and\r\nmore animation than is usual in his genre-pictures. He has not preserved\r\nthe lovely, indeterminate colour or the impressionist touch which was\r\nthe natural inheritance of Watteau or Tiepolo. His backgrounds are dark\r\nand heavy, and he makes too free a use of body colour; but his attitude\r\nis one of close observation--he enjoys depicting the life around him,\r\nand we suspect that he sees in it the most perfect form of social\r\nintercourse imaginable. Longhi is sometimes called the Goldoni of\r\npainting, and he certainly more nearly resembles the genial, humorous\r\nplaywright than he does Hogarth, to whom he has also been compared. Yet\r\nhis execution and technique are a little like Hogarth's, and it is\r\npossible that he was influenced by the elder and stronger master, who\r\nentered on his triumphant career as a satirical painter of society\r\nabout 1734. This was just the time when Longhi abandoned his unlucky\r\ndecorative style, and it is quite possible that he may have met with\r\nengravings of the \"Marriage à la mode,\" and was stimulated by them to\r\nthe study of eighteenth-century manners, though his own temperament is\r\nfar removed from Hogarth's moral force and grim satire. His serene,\r\npainstaking observation is never distracted by grossness and violence.\r\nThe Venetians of his day may have been--undoubtedly were--effeminate,\r\nlicentious, and decadent, but they were kind and gracious, of refined\r\nmanners, well-bred, genial and intelligent, and so Longhi has\r\ntranscribed them. In the time which followed, ceilings were covered by\r\nBoucher, pastels by Latour were in demand, the scholars of David painted\r\nclassical scenes, and Pietro Longhi was forgotten. Antonio Francesco\r\nCorrer bought five hundred of his drawings from his son, Alessandro, but\r\nhis works were ignored and dispersed. The classic and romantic fashions\r\npassed, but it was only in 1850 that the brothers de Goncourt, writing\r\non art, revived consideration for the painter of a bygone generation.\r\nMany of his works are in private collections, especially in England, but\r\nfew are in public galleries. The National Gallery is fortunate in\r\npossessing several excellent examples.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Pietro Longhi._\r\n                 VISIT TO THE FORTUNE-TELLER.\r\n                _London._\r\n                 (_Photo, Hanfstängl._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\r\n\r\n Bergamo.

Giovanni Antonio Canale was born in Venice in 1697, the same\r\nyear as Tiepolo. His father earned his living at the profession,\r\nlucrative enough just then, of scene-painting, and Antonio learned to\r\nhandle his brush, working at his side. In 1719 he went off to seek his\r\nfortune in Rome, and though he was obliged to help out his resources by\r\nhis early trade, he was most concerned in the study of architecture,\r\nancient and modern. Rome spoke to him through the eye, by the\r\npicturesque masses of stonework, the warm harmonious tones of classic\r\nremains and the effects of light upon them. He painted almost entirely\r\nout-of-doors, and has left many examples drawn from the ruins. His\r\nsuccess in Rome was not remarkable, and he was still a very young man\r\nwhen he retraced his steps. On regaining his native town, he realised\r\nfor the first time the beauty of its canals and palaces, and he never\r\nagain wavered in his allegiance.\r\n\r\nTwo rivals were already in the field, Luca Carlevaris, whose works were\r\nfreely bought by the rich Venetians, and Marco Ricci, the figures in\r\nwhose views of Venice were often touched in by his uncle, Sebastiano;\r\nbut Canale's growing fame soon dethroned them, \"i cacciati del nido,\" as\r\nhe said, using Dante's expression. In a generation full of caprice,\r\ndelighting in sensational developments, Canale was methodical to a\r\nfault, and worked steadily, calmly producing every detail of Venetian\r\nlandscape with untiring application and almost monotonous tranquillity.\r\nHe lived in the midst of a band of painters who adored travel.\r\nSebastiano Ricci was always on the move; Tiepolo spent much of his time\r\nin other cities and countries, and passed the last years of his life in\r\nSpain; Pietro Rotari was attached to the Court of St. Petersburg;\r\nBelotto, Canale's nephew, settled in Bohemia; but Canale remained at\r\nhome, and, except for two short visits paid to England, contented\r\nhimself with trips to Padua and Verona.\r\n\r\nEarly in life Canale entered into relations with Joseph Smith, the\r\nBritish Consul in Venice, a connoisseur who had not only formed a fine\r\ncollection of pictures, but had a gallery from which he was very ready\r\nto sell to travellers. He bought of the young Venetian at a very low\r\nprice, and contrived, unfairly enough, to acquire the right to all his\r\nwork for a certain period of time, with the object of sending it, at a\r\ngood profit, to London. For a time Canale's luminous views were bought\r\nby the English under these auspices, but the artist, presently\r\ndiscovering that he was making a bad bargain, came over to England,\r\nwhere he met with an encouraging reception, especially at Windsor Castle\r\nand from the Duke of Richmond. Canale spent two years in England and\r\npainted on the Thames and at Cambridge, but he could not stand the\r\nEnglish climate and fled from the damp and fogs to his own lagoons.\r\n\r\nTo describe his paintings is to describe Venice at every hour of the day\r\nand night--Venice with its long array of noble palaces, with its Grand\r\nCanal and its narrow, picturesque waterways. He reproduces the Venice we\r\nknow, and we see how little it has changed. The gondolas cluster round\r\nthe landing-stages of the Piazzetta, the crowds hurry in and out of the\r\narcades of the Ducal Palace, or he paints the festivals that still\r\nretained their splendour: the Great Bucentaur leaving the Riva dei\r\nSchiavoni on the Feast of the Ascension, or San Geremia and the entrance\r\nto the Cannaregio decked in flags for a feast-day. From one end to\r\nanother of the Grand Canal, that \"most beautiful street in the world,\"\r\nas des Commines called it in 1495, we can trace every aspect of\r\nCanale's time, when the city had as yet lost nothing of its splendour\r\nor its animation. At the entrance stands S. Maria della Salute, that\r\nsanctuary dear to Venetian hearts, built as a votive offering after the\r\nvisitation of the plague in 1631. Its flamboyant dome, with its volutes,\r\nits population of stone saints, its green bronze door catching the\r\nlight, pleased Canale, as it pleased Sargent in our own day, and he\r\npainted it over and over again. The annual fête of the Confraternity of\r\nthe Carità takes place at the Scuola di San Rocco, and Canale paints the\r\nold Renaissance building which shelters so much of Tintoretto's finest\r\nwork, decorated with ropes of greenery and gay with flags,[7] while\r\nTiepolo has put in the red-robed, periwigged councillors and the gazing\r\npopulace. Near it in the National Gallery hangs a \"Regatta\" with its\r\narray of boats, its shouting gondoliers, and its shadows lying across\r\nthe range of palaces, and telling the exact hour of the day that it was\r\nsketched in; or, again, the painter has taken peculiar pleasure in\r\nexpressing quiet days, with calm green waters and wide empty piazzas,\r\ndivided by sun and shadow, with a few citizens plodding about their\r\nbusiness in the hot midday, or a quiet little abbé crossing the piazza\r\non his way to Mass. Canale has made a special study of the light on wall\r\nand façade, and of the transparent waters of the canals and the azure\r\nskies in which float great snowy fleeces.\r\n\r\n [7] It is thought that it may have been painted from his studio.\r\n\r\nHis second visit to England was paid in 1751. He was received with open\r\narms by the great world, and invited to the houses of the nobility in\r\ntown and country. The English were delighted with his taste and with the\r\nmastery with which he painted architectural scenes, and in spite of\r\nadvancing years he produced a number of compositions, which commanded\r\nhigh prices. The Garden of Vauxhall, the Rotunda at Ranelagh, Whitehall,\r\nNorthumberland House, Eton College, were some of the subjects which\r\nattracted him, and the treatment of which was signalised by his calm and\r\nperfect balance. He made use of the camera ottica, which is in principal\r\nidentical with the camera oscura. Lanzi says he amended its defects and\r\ntaught its proper use, but it must be confessed that in the careful\r\nperspective of some of his scenes, its traces seem to haunt us and to\r\nconvey a certain cold regularity. Canale was a marvellous engraver.\r\nMantegna, Bellini, and Titian had placed engraving on a very high level\r\nin the Venetian School, and though at a later date it became too\r\nelaborate, Tiepolo and his son brought it back to simplicity. Canale\r\naided them, and his _eaux-fortes_, of which he has left about thirty,\r\nare filled with light and breadth of treatment, and he is particularly\r\nhappy in his brilliant, transparent water.\r\n\r\nThe high prices Canale obtained for his pictures in his lifetime led to\r\nthe usual imitations. He was surrounded by painters whose whole ambition\r\nwas limited to copying him. Among these were Marieschi, Visentini,\r\nColombini, besides others now forgotten. More than fifty of his finest\r\nworks were bought by Smith for George III. and fill a room at Windsor.\r\nHe was made a member of the Academy at Dresden, and Bruhl, the Prime\r\nMinister of the Elector, obtained from him twenty-one works which now\r\nadorn the gallery there. Canale died in Venice, where he had lived\r\nnearly all his life, and where his gondola-studio was a familiar object\r\nin the Piazzetta, at the Lido, or anchored in the long canals.\r\n\r\nHis nephew, Bernardo Belotto, is often also called Canaletto, and it\r\nseems that both uncle and nephew were equally known by the diminutive.\r\nBelotto, too, went to Rome early in his career, where he attached\r\nhimself to Panini, a painter of classic ruins, peopled with warriors and\r\nshepherds. He was, by all accounts, full of vanity and self-importance,\r\nand on a visit to Germany managed to acquire the title of Count, which\r\nhe adhered to with great complacency. He travelled all over Italy\r\nlooking for patronage, and was very eager to find the road to success\r\nand fortune. About the same time as his uncle, he paid a visit to London\r\nand was patronised by Horace Walpole, but in the full tide of success\r\nhe was summoned to Dresden, where the Elector, disappointed at not\r\nhaving secured the services of the uncle, was fain to console himself\r\nwith those of the nephew. The extravagant and profligate Augustus II.,\r\nwhose one idea was to extract money by every possible means from his\r\nsubjects, in order to adorn his palaces, was consistently devoted to\r\nBelotto, who was in his element as a Court painter. He paints all his\r\nuncle's subjects, and it is not always easy to distinguish between the\r\ntwo; but his paintings are dull and stiff as compared with those of\r\nCanale, though he is sometimes fine in colour, and many of his views are\r\nadmirably drawn.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME WORKS OF CANALE\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to draw up any exhaustive list, so many being in\r\nprivate collections.\r\n\r\n Dresden.

Apostoli,\r\nalong the Fondamenta Nuove, a good pupil of the famous Canaletto, having\r\nby the aid of the camera ottica, most successfully painted two canvases\r\n(not small) by the order of a stranger (an Englishman), with views of\r\nthe Piazza San Marco, towards the Church and the Clock Tower, and of the\r\nBridge of the Rialto and buildings towards the Cannaregio, and have\r\nto-day examined them under the colonnades of the Procurazie and met with\r\nuniversal applause.\"\r\n\r\nFrancesco Guardi was a son of the Austrian Tyrol, and his mountain\r\nancestry may account, as in the case of Titian, for the freshness and\r\nvigour of his art. Both his father, who settled in Venice, and his\r\nbrother were painters. His son became one in due time, and the\r\nprofession being followed by four members of the family accounts\r\nfor the indifferent works often attributed to Guardi.\r\n\r\nHis indebtedness to Canale is universally acknowledged, and perhaps it\r\nis true that he never attains to the monumental quality, the traditional\r\ndignity which marks Canale out as a great master, but he differs from\r\nCanale in temperament, style, and technique. Canale is a much more exact\r\nand serious student of architectural detail; Guardi, with greater\r\nvisible vigour, obliterates detail, and has no hesitation in drawing in\r\nbuildings which do not really appear. In his oval painting of the Ducal\r\nPalace (Wallace Collection) he makes it much loftier and more spacious\r\nthan it really is. In his \"Piazzetta\" he puts in a corner of the Loggia\r\nwhere it would not actually be seen. In the \"Fair in Piazza S. Marco\"\r\nthe arch from under which the Fair appears is gigantic, and he\r\nforeshortens the wing of the royal palace. He curtails the length of the\r\ncolumns in the piazza and so avoids monotony of effect, and he often\r\nalters the height of the campaniles he uses, making them tall and\r\nslender or short and broad, as his picture requires. At one time he\r\nproduced some colossal pictures, in several of which Mr. Simonson, who\r\nhas written an admirable life of the painter, believes that the hand of\r\nCanale is perceptible in collaboration; but it was not his natural\r\nelement, and he often became heavy in colour and handling. In 1782 he\r\nundertook a commission from Pietro Edwards, who was a noted connoisseur\r\nand inspector of State pictures, and had been appointed superintendent\r\nin 1778 of an official studio for the restoration of old masters.\r\n\r\nEdwards had important dealings with Guardi, who was directed to paint\r\nfour leading incidents in the rejoicings in honour of the visit of Pius\r\nIV. to Venice. The Venetians themselves had become indifferent patrons\r\nof art, but Venice attracted great numbers of foreign visitors, and\r\nbefore the second half of the eighteenth century the export of old\r\nmasters had already become an established trade. There is no sign,\r\nhowever, that Joseph Smith, who retained his consulship till 1760,\r\nextended any patronage to Guardi, though he enriched George III.'s\r\ncollection with works of the chief contemporary artists of Venice. It is\r\nprobable that Guardi had been warned against him by Canale and profited\r\nby the latter's experience.\r\n\r\nWe can divide his work into three categories. 1. Views of Venice. 2.\r\nPublic ceremonies. 3. Landscapes. Gradenigo mentions casually that he\r\nused the camera ottica, but though we may consider it probable, we\r\ncannot trace the use of it in his works. He is not only a painter of\r\narchitecture, but pays great attention to light and atmosphere, and aims\r\nat subtle effects; a transparent haze floats over the lagoons, or the\r\nsun pierces though the morning mists. His four large pendants in the\r\nWallace Collection show his happiest efforts; light glances off the\r\nwater and is reflected on the shadowed walls. His views round the Salute\r\nbring vividly before us those delicious morning hours in Venice when the\r\ngreen tide has just raced up the Grand Canal, when a fresh wind is\r\nlifting and curling all the loose sails and fluttering pennons, and when\r\nthe gondoliers are straining at the oars, as their light craft is caught\r\nand blown from side to side upon the rippling water. The sky occupies\r\nmuch of his space, he makes searching studies of it, and his favourite\r\neffect is a flash of light shooting across a piled-up mass of clouds.\r\nThe line of the horizon is low, and he exhibits great mastery in\r\npainting the wide lagoons, but he also paints rough seas, and is one\r\nof the few masters of his day--perhaps the only one--who succeeds in\r\nrepresenting a storm at sea.\r\n\r\nOften as he paints the same subjects he never becomes mechanical or\r\nphotographic. We may sometimes tire of the monotony of Canale's unerring\r\nperspective and accurate buildings, but Guardi always finds some new\r\nrendering, some fresh point of interest. Sometimes he gives us a summer\r\nday, when Venice stands out in light, her white palaces reflected in the\r\nsun-illumined water; sometimes he is arrested by old churches bathed in\r\nshadow and fusing into the rich, dark tones of twilight. His boats and\r\nfigures are introduced with great spirit and _brio_, and are alive\r\nwith that handling which a French critic has described as his _griffe\r\nendiablée_.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: _Francesco Guardi._\r\n                 S. MARIA DELLA SALUTE.\r\n                _London._\r\n                 (_Photo, Mansell and Co._)]\r\n\r\nHis masterly and spirited painting of crowds enables him to reproduce\r\nfor us all those public ceremonies which Venice retained as long as the\r\nRepublic lasted: yearly pilgrimages of the Doge to Venetian churches, to\r\nthe Salute to commemorate the cessation of the plague, to San Zaccaria\r\non Easter Day, the solemn procession on Corpus Christi Day, receptions\r\nof ambassadors, and, most gorgeous of all, the Feast of the Wedding of\r\nthe Adriatic. He has faithfully preserved the ancient ceremonial which\r\naccompanied State festivities. In the \"Fête du Jeudi Gras\" (Louvre) he\r\nillustrates the acrobatic feats which were performed before Doge\r\nMocenigo. A huge Temple of Victory is erected on the Piazzetta, and\r\ngondoliers are seen climbing on each other's shoulders and dancing upon\r\nropes. His motley crowds show that the whole population, patricians as\r\nwell as people, took part in the feasts. He has also left many striking\r\ninteriors: among others, that of the Sala del Gran Consiglio, where\r\nsometimes as many as a thousand persons were assembled, the \"Reception\r\nof the Doge and Senate by Pius IV.\" (which formed one of the series\r\nordered by Pietro Edwards), or the fine \"Interior of a Theatre,\"\r\nexhibited at the Burlington Fine Arts in 1911, belonging to a series\r\nof which another is at Munich.\r\n\r\nIn his landscapes Guardi does not pay very faithful attention to nature.\r\nThe landscape painters of the eighteenth century, as Mr. Simonson points\r\nout, were not animated by any very genuine impulse to study nature\r\nminutely. It was the picturesque element which appealed to them, and\r\nthey were chiefly concerned to reproduce romantic features, grouped\r\naccording to fancy. Guardi composes half fantastic scenes, introducing\r\nclassic remains, triumphal arches, airy Palladian monuments. His\r\n_capricci_ include compositions in which Roman ruins, overgrown with\r\nfoliage, occupy the foreground of a painting of Venetian palaces, but in\r\nwhich the combination is carried out with so much sparkle and nervous\r\nlife and such charm of style, that it is attractive and piquant rather\r\nthan grotesque.\r\n\r\nEngland is richest in Guardis, of any country, but France in one respect\r\nis better off, in possessing no less than eleven fine paintings of\r\npublic ceremonials. Guardi may be considered the originator of small\r\nsketches, and perhaps the precursor of those glib little views which are\r\nhanded about the Piazza at the present day. His drawings are fairly\r\nnumerous, and are remarkably delicate and incisive in touch. A large\r\ncollection which he left to his son is now in the Museo Correr. In his\r\nlater years he was reduced to poverty and used to exhibit sketches in\r\nthe Piazza, parting with them for a few ducats, and in this way flooding\r\nVenice with small landscapes. The exact spot occupied by his _bottega_\r\nis said to be at the corner of the Palazzo Reale, opposite the Clock\r\nTower. The house in which he died still exists in the Campiello della\r\nMadonna, No. 5433, Parrocchia S. Canziano, and has a shrine dedicated to\r\nthe Madonna attached to it. When quite an old man, Guardi paid a visit\r\nto the home of his ancestors, at Mastellano in the Austrian Tyrol, and\r\nmade a drawing of Castello Corvello on the route. To this day his name\r\nis remembered with pride in his Tyrolean valley.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME WORKS OF GUARDI\r\n\r\n Bergamo. Lochis: Landscapes.\r\n Berlin.

Sansoni's edition (Florence),\r\nwith Milanesi's notes, is the most authoritative; and for translations,\r\nthose of Mrs. Foster (Messrs. Blashfield and Hopkins), and a new edition\r\nin the Temple classics (Dent, 8 vols., 2s. each vol.).\r\n\r\nRidolfi, the principal contemporary authority on Venetian artists, who\r\npublished his _Maraviglie dell' arte_ nine years after Domenico\r\nTintoretto's death, is only to be read in Italian, though the anecdotes\r\nwith which his work abounds are made use of by every writer.\r\n\r\nCrowe and Cavalcaselle's _Painting in North Italy_ (Murray) is a\r\nstorehouse of painstaking, minute, and, on the whole, marvellously\r\ncorrect information and sound opinion. It supplies a foundation, fills\r\ngaps, and supplements individual biographies as no other book does. For\r\nthe early painters, down to the time of the Bellini, _I Origini dei\r\npittori veneziani_, by Professor Leonello Venturi, Venice, 1907, is a\r\nlarge book, written with mastery and insight, and well illustrated; _La\r\nStoria della pittura veneziana_ is another careful work, which deals\r\nvery minutely with the early school of mosaics.\r\n\r\nIn studying the Bellini, the late Mr. S. A. Strong has _The Brothers\r\nBellini_ (Bell's Great Masters), and the reader should not fail to read\r\nMr. Roger Fry's _Bellini_ (Artist's Library), a scholarly monograph,\r\nshort but reliable, and full of suggestion and appreciation, though\r\nwritten in a cool, critical spirit. Dr. Hills has dealt ably with\r\n_Pisanello_ (Duckworth).\r\n\r\nMolmenti and Ludwig in their monumental work _Vittore Carpaccio_,\r\ntranslated by Mr. R. H. Cust (Murray, 1907), and Paul Kristeller in the\r\nequally important _Mantegna_, translated by Mr. S. A. Strong (Longmans,\r\n1901), seem to have exhausted all that there is to be said for the\r\nmoment concerning these two painters.\r\n\r\nIt is almost superfluous to mention Mr. Berenson's two well-known\r\nvolumes, _The Venetian Painters of the Renaissance_, and the _North\r\nItalian Painters of the Renaissance_ (Putnam). They are brilliant essays\r\nwhich supplement every other work, overflowing with suggestive and\r\ncritical matter, supplying original thoughts, and summing up in a few\r\npregnant words the main features and the tendencies of the succeeding\r\nstages.\r\n\r\nIn studying Giorgione, we cannot dispense with Pater's essay, included\r\nin _The Renaissance_. The author is not always well informed as to\r\nfacts--he wrote in the early days of criticism--but he is rich in idea\r\nand feeling. Mr. Herbert Cook's _Life of Giorgione_ (Bell's Great\r\nMasters) is full and interesting. Some authorities question his\r\nattributions as being too numerous, but whether we regard them as\r\nauthentic works of the master or as belonging to his school, the\r\nillustrations he gives add materially to our knowledge of the\r\nGiorgionesque.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to Titian we are well off. Crowe and Cavalcaselle's _Life\r\nof Titian_ (Murray, out of print), in two large volumes, is well written\r\nand full of good material, from which subsequent writers have borrowed.\r\nAn excellent Life, full of penetrating criticism, by Mr. C. Ricketts,\r\nwas lately brought out by Methuen (Classics of Art), complete with\r\nillustrations, and including a minute analysis of Titian's technique.\r\nSir Claude Phillips's Monograph on Titian will appeal to every thoughtful\r\nlover of the painter's genius, and Dr. Gronau has written a good and\r\nscholarly Life (Duckworth).\r\n\r\nMr. Berenson's _Lorenzo Lotto_ must be read for its interest and\r\nlearning, given with all the author's charm and lucidity. It includes an\r\nessay on Alvise Vivarini.\r\n\r\nMy own _Tintoretto_ (Methuen, Classics of Art) gives a full account of\r\nthe man and his work, and especially deals exhaustively with the scheme\r\nand details of the Scuola di San Rocco. Professor Thode has written a\r\ndetailed and profusely illustrated Life of Tintoretto in the Knackfuss\r\nSeries, and the Paradiso has been treated at length and illustrated\r\nin great detail in a very scholarly _édition de luxe_ by Mr. F. O.\r\nOsmaston. It is the fashion to discard Ruskin, but though we may allow\r\nthat his judgments are exaggerated, that he reads more into a picture\r\nthan the artist intended, and that he is too fond of preaching sermons,\r\nthere are few critics who have so many ideas to give us, or who are so\r\ninformed with a deep love of art, and both _Modern Painters_ and the\r\n_Stones of Venice_ should be read.\r\n\r\nM. Charles Yriarte has written a Life of Paolo Veronese, which is full\r\nof charm and knowledge. It is interesting to take a copy of Boschini's\r\n_Della pittura veneziana_, 1797, when visiting the galleries, the\r\npalaces, and the churches of Venice. His lists of the pictures, as they\r\nwere known in his day, often open our eyes to doubtful attributions.\r\nSecond-hand copies of Boschini are not difficult to pick up. When the\r\nlater-century artists are reached, a good sketch of the Venice of their\r\nperiod is supplied by Philippe Monnier's delightful _Venice in the\r\nEighteenth Century_ (Chatto and Windus), which also has a good chapter\r\non the lesser Venetian masters. The best Life of Tiepolo is in Italian,\r\nby Professor Pompeo Molmenti. The smaller masters have to be hunted for\r\nin many scattered essays; a knowledge of Goldoni adds point to Longhi's\r\npictures. Canaletto and his nephew, Belotto, have been treated by M.\r\nUzanne, _Les Deux Canaletto_; and Mr. Simonson has written an important\r\nand charming volume on Francesco Guardi (Methuen, 1904), with beautiful\r\nreproductions of his works. Among other books which give special\r\ninformation are Morelli's two volumes, _Italian Painters in Borghese and\r\nDoria Pamphili_, and _In Dresden and Munich Galleries_, translated by\r\nMiss Jocelyn ffoulkes (Murray); and Dr. J. P. Richter's magnificent\r\ncatalogue of the Mond Collection--which, though published at fifteen\r\nguineas, can be seen in the great art libraries--has some valuable\r\nchapters on the Venetian masters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n Academy, Florence, 28\r\n   Venice, 13, 16, 19, 32, 36, 38, 40, 43, 47, 52,\r\n     57, 67, 80, 102, 116, 117, 171, 183, 196, 202,\r\n     205, 206, 210, 211, 217, 219, 226, 227, 242,\r\n     262, 267, 271, 277, 281, 286, 295, 296, 308,\r\n     313, 320\r\n Adoration of Magi, 28, 31, 116, 131, 197, 205, 287\r\n Adoration of Shepherds, 116, 196, 222,\r\n     273, 275\r\n Agnolo Gaddi, 15\r\n Alemagna, Giovanni, 29-32, 36, 37, 58\r\n Altichiero, 24, 25\r\n Alvise Vivarini, 58-63, 65, 66, 69, 79,\r\n     104, 105, 112, 187, 190, 223, 330\r\n Amalteo, Pomponio, 219\r\n Amigoni, 292\r\n Anconæ, 12, 17, 18, 24, 36, 45, 59, 60, 187\r\n Angelico, Fra, 48\r\n Annunciation, 16, 26, 45, 178, 183, 258, 286\r\n Antonello da Messina, 50, 51, 59, 62, 66\r\n Antonio da Murano, 29, 31, 32, 36, 37, 58\r\n Antonio Negroponte, 37, 44\r\n Antonio Veneziano, 15\r\n Aretino, 163, 166, 167, 172-174, 182, 192,\r\n     201, 234, 236, 240\r\n Ascension, 41\r\n Augsburg, 176, 266, 276\r\n\r\n Badile, 229\r\n Balestra, 287\r\n Baptism of Christ, 41, 98, 255\r\n Bartolommeo Vivarini, 32, 36, 37, 38, 48, 58, 59,\r\n     64, 189, 223, 225\r\n Basaiti, Marco, 104, 111-116\r\n Bassano, 10, 247, 269-276, 282\r\n Bastiani, Lazzaro, 70, 73, 79\r\n Battoni, Pompeo, 297, 298\r\n Bellini, Gentile, 48-57, 68, 70, 81, 83, 89, 90,\r\n     99, 101, 103, 146\r\n Bellini, Giovanni, 10, 43, 48, 55, 61, 62, 63, 69,\r\n     78, 81, 82, 84-89, 90, 92, 94-101, 103, 104,\r\n     107, 109, 112-114, 122, 123, 127, 129, 130,\r\n     134, 140, 146, 147, 152, 155, 158, 159, 179,\r\n     186, 187, 223, 225, 318, 329, 330\r\n Bellini, Jacopo, 27, 28, 39-43, 58, 81-84, 86\r\n Belotto, 315, 319-331\r\n Bembo, Cardinal, 97, 111, 174, 240\r\n Benson, Mr., 47, 80, 116, 117, 143\r\n Berenson, Mr., 156, 187, 195, 210, 221, 229, 243,\r\n     307, 330\r\n Bergamo, 101, 114, 116, 117, 141, 143, 185, 188,\r\n     190, 196, 211, 219, 226, 227, 276, 308, 313, 328\r\n Berlin, 19, 32, 35, 47, 57, 66, 80, 101, 115-117,\r\n     139, 182, 196, 211, 223, 226, 227, 266, 308, 328\r\n Bissolo, 104, 114, 115, 117\r\n Blanc, M.
